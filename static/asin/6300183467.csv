203069,AADJXNY9HSKJF,6300183467,Aaron,"[1, 1]","This is a very amusing movie and one of my favorites. The story focuses around Molly Ringwald on her 16th birthday. Her entire family seems to forget as they bustle around to prepare for her older sister's wedding. To add to things, her grandparents are staying at their house along with the very strange Chinese exchange student Long Duck Dong. Meanwhile, Sam (Molly Ringwald) is locked on her fantasy world revolving around the high school stud while trying to evoid the high school geek (Anthony Michael Hall.) A definite crowd-pleaser. The grandparents are a riot without even trying to be and Long Duck Dong is just...weird, but amusing. Molly Ringwald is terrific in her role.

I mean, nobody I knew liked her or found her attractive by any means. Her career only lasted for three films, and all of them sucked quite badly. Sixteen Candles is no exception to this rule and is possibly the least evil of the three. It wasn't Molly Ringworm that made the film somewhat watchable in an excruciatingly corny way. I think it was the John Hughes feel about it that drew me in, and he made incredible films in the 80's until he sold himself out in the mid 90's. Then, he was John Hughes no more. I think largely he was helped by John Candy who made a lasting impression that still lasts to this day. Back to Sixteen Candles, Anthony Michael Hall sucked...the Donger sucked...the Matt Dillon look-alike sucked (although that's a great car there)...Molly Ringworm sucked (you knew that already, didn't you?)...John Cusack sucked (he is above this inferior trash)...Joan Cusack sucked (she always has in every film). Speaking of the Donger, I've not seen this much racism against Asians since I saw Collision Course with Jay Leno and Pat Morita. Like I believe the story, a rich high school senior would be interested in the sophomore ugly duckling. Hell, just pick any girl that is in college, somebody with money and looks.

Seeing it once again took me back to the days of leg warmers, anti-political correctness, and creative musical arrangements emanating from the radio. I know that my conclusion is somewhat controversial, but I honestly think that it was John Hughes's finest film. Only moments after it opens, the laughs begin and they never seemed to subside. I even had to go back and replay the scene on the bus a few times just because it was so incredibly hysterical. It's a perfect portrait of the anarchy many of us remember. More memorable than Ringwald's performance--and it made her--was that of Anthony Michael Hall who stole the movie out from under her. Every time he's onscreen one can't help but smile, and some of his lines cannot be easily forgotten. Farmer Ted, along with his friends/geeks, resonates deeply (although some of us might not want to admit it). The soundtrack is excellent and I downloaded the lead in by Altered Images a few minutes after the DVD ended.

Pretty but not glamorous, Molly served as a beacon of sorts for me.  Sixteen Candles is the first of a string of films in which Molly Ringwald dramatized the teen angst so many of us felt  This is basically the story of Samantha (Molly), who must deal with the fact that her family forgets her 16th birthday while she is also suffering from the bad effects of a crush on a boy who seemingly doesn't know she exists.  I love to rewatch Molly's  movies every so often in order to capture some of those feelings of lovelorn giddiness that seemed to disappear in my 20s.  This movie is very funny and does succeed in conveying the feelings of a confused teenager, yet it seems overblown in some places.  For example, the whole Asian foreign exchange student character is far from needed, the degree to which teenaged partygoers wreck the host's home is extreme, the dental headpiece worn by a young Joan Cusack serves no purpose, and the farcical wedding of Samanth'a sister is pretty silly.  I should say that Anthony Michael Hall as &quot;the geek&quot; is superb and almost steals the whole show, but for me this movie is all about Molly.Where this movie excels is in its portrayal of teenaged emotions and teenager-parent relations.  The very notion that your parents might forget your sweet sixteenth birthday is downright traumatic.  The scene between Samantha and her father late that night struck me as classic.  Even though the father gets his daughter to open up to him, he does not understand what she is talking about when it should be obvious to anyone; his clich&eacute; responses to the real problem are typically useless parental words of support.  Segments of the movie such as this are very real and connect on a personal level with the viewer.  I would like to have seen more of this type of interaction, but the farcical elements of the movie dominate the screen and, in my opinion, make it less successful than it should have been.  As for the music, the rescoring of the motion picture does have a negative impact on the viewing experience; there are still some cool 80s songs that bring back memories, but the new music pasted into the film is often too loud, inappropriate, and just plain wrong, especially for those of us who have watched this movie a number of times and plan to watch it again and again as we get older.  All in all, though, this is a fun movie and a great way to rekindle your memories of young adulthood.

Although the above-mentioned perks make turning this all-important age worthwhile, just imagine your probable surprise when your entire family suddenly forgets your sixteenth birthday. One's 16th birthday may seem like a dream come true for the majority of teenagers out there, but for Samantha (Molly Ringwald), reaching this pivotal age in her life has become a total nightmare. That, along with a Chinese foreign exchange student living in her family's house doesn't make things any easier for our red-headed damsel in distress. The real kicker is when an annoying teenaged geek (Anthony Michael Hall) enters Samantha's trying life. This fellow simply known as &quot;The Geek&quot; just doesn't know when to quit, as he tries attempt after hard-luck attempt to get Samantha to notice him. In his rather fragile attempts to gain Sam's attention, our desparate &quot;geek&quot; does everything in his power to get her to attend the school dance, but &quot;The Geek&quot;'s plans fall on deaf ears. Sam has her sights set on the most popular guy in school, who, in turn, has other &quot;babes&quot; at his beckoned call as well. Although &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; is a teenage coming of age film both written and directed by teen film impresario John Hughes, one would expect this to be both a comedy and a drama, but &quot;SC&quot; contains more of the latter than of the former. It still retains a grand heap of delightful Hughesian charm, nevertheless. Hughes would take that style of charm to the next level with his &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot;, which truly made superstars out of both Ringwald and Hall (including the rest of the &quot;Brat Pack&quot; cast not mentioned). But, before both these above-noted actors joined this exclusive &quot;Club&quot;, they really paid their dues with &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot;, where both Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall cut their teeth quite sharply before moving on to future work, including a stop at an exclusive &quot;Club&quot;, as mentioned previously. &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; is definitely one for the ultimate John Hughes viewing experience, and all a wonderful thrill to see and hear (including other Hughes flicks such as &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot;, &quot;Ferris Bueller's Day Off&quot;, &quot;Planes, Trains and Automobiles&quot;, and more) for yourself!

In a funny scene, Samantha is talking on the phone to her best friend, complaining how she has to go down stairs &amp; endure the family making a big fuss over her birthday.  When she gets downstairs, not a word about her birthday, mom even forgot to make her lunch.  The look of utter suprise on Sammy's face is priceless, and Ringwald has that cute kewpie doll face that really makes the expression work.The other issues in the movie, growing up, falling love, interacting with family &amp; friends are very real.  One of Hughe's greatest strengths as a filmmaker is the keen ear he has for teen dialogue.  His characters act &amp; speak like REAL teenagers, not some hollywood producers conception of teenagers.I especially liked Paul Dooley as Sammy's father, he was affectionate without being sappy, and their scene in the living room is warm and engaging.The happy ending is wonderful.If you like well made movies that capture the teenage years and the 1980's, check out &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot;.",5,Sweet Sixteen,1078963200,"03 11, 2004",2004,1306,"['John', 'Hughes', 'directorial', 'debut', 'quot', 'Sixteen', 'Candles', 'quot', 'real', 'treat', 'cast', 'young', 'actors', 'are', 'very', 'genuine', 'story', 'line', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'Samantha', 'Baker', 'Molly', 'Ringwald', 'sixteenth', 'birthday', 'forgotten', 'hectic', 'day', 'big', 'sister', 'wedding', 'funny', 'scene', 'Samantha', 'talking', 'phone', 'best', 'friend', 'complaining', 'how', 'go', 'down', 'stairs', 'amp', 'family', 'making', 'big', 'fuss', 'birthday', 'When', 'downstairs', 'not', 'word', 'birthday', 'mom', 'even', 'forgot', 'make', 'lunch', 'look', 'utter', 'suprise', 'Sammy', 'face', 'priceless', 'Ringwald', 'cute', 'kewpie', 'doll', 'face', 'really', 'expression', 'other', 'issues', 'movie', 'growing', 'up', 'falling', 'love', 'interacting', 'family', 'amp', 'friends', 'are', 'very', 'real', 'One', 'Hughe', 'greatest', 'strengths', 'filmmaker', 'keen', 'ear', 'teen', 'dialogue', 'characters', 'act', 'amp', 'speak', 'REAL', 'teenagers', 'not', 'hollywood', 'producers', 'conception', 'teenagers.I', 'especially', 'liked', 'Paul', 'Dooley', 'Sammy', 'father', 'was', 'affectionate', 'being', 'sappy', 'scene', 'living', 'room', 'warm', 'engaging.The', 'happy', 'ending', 'wonderful.If', 'like', 'well', 'made', 'movies', 'capture', 'teenage', 'years', '1980', 'check', 'out', 'quot', 'Sixteen', 'Candles', 'quot']",N/A

This is a milestone most of us remember in one way, shape or form.  After all, at 16 we're about 1/2 way through high school and just 2 years(!) away from having to be considered as adults.  Just one problem:  everyone has forgotten about Samantha's birthday.  Oh no!  With her older sister getting married, Samantha's family has had too many distractions to keep up with anything involving normalcy.Poor Samantha is also suffering the heartache of suffering a crush on a senior who could never return her love.  Or could he?  As Hamlet would say, THAT is the question!  {Ah, nothing like teenage puppy love;  my oh my how I remember it well}If you're into 80s nostalgia (like me!) then this DVD is a must-have.  It stars Anthony Michael Hall as a mega-geek;  just before his career flamed out.  It also stars a young John Cusack in a bit part.  Even though Cusack has maybe a dozen lines, one can still see the genesis of the on-screen charisma he would exude - little wonder that charisma launched him into stardom.Looking back 20+ years later, these so called ""brat pack"" movies are more important than ever for people like me who grew up during the 80s.

203130,A84Z6XUMGRMJ1,6300183467,Duane Thomas,"[6, 8]","Samantha Baker (Molly Ringwald) is having the worst day of her life. Her entire family, including heartless parents, have forgotten her sixteenth birthday. Her stuck-up sister is getting married tomorrow. The hunk of her dreams, Jake Ryan (Michael Shoeffling) doesn't even know she's alive - or so she thinks - because he's going with Caroline Mulford, the shallow, beautiful Big Blond On Campus (Haviland Morris). On top of all that, a sawed-off geek with delusions of coolness (Anthony Michael Hall) has the hots for her.In a typical movie, the hunk would be totally unable to appreciate Sam, and, after breaking her own heart, she'd realize the cute and lovable geek was really the guy for her. John Hughes, writer and first-time director, plays against expectation by making Jake sensitive, decent, looking for a stable relationship, and quite capable of recognizing in Sam good material for same. Problem: Sam is so shy she flees every time he looks at her, and her reaction makes Jake think she hates his guts. The geek, after drooling over Sam to start, finds surprising reserves of wisdom, persuasiveness, and real coolness in spite of himself, and dedicates his efforts to getting these two together. Sam's parents turn out to be loving and caring, simply overwhelmed by the insanity of the upcoming wedding. In the end, even Caroline, the shallow, beautiful girlfriend turns out to be not so shallow, after all.Molly Ringwald is sweetly charming as Sam. Michael Schoeffling and Haviland Morris are beautiful people with real acting ability, both deserving of more successful careers after this movie than they had. John and Joan Cusack have small parts, and it's interesting to see what they looked like as babies. But it's Anthony Michael Hall's portrayal of a pubescent wannabe hustler that makes the movie.Really the only major negative in this film, that cost it a fifth star with me, is the character of Long Duk Dong, the Chinese exchange student. Why Long Dong (get it?) is even in this movie is beyond me. He's totally superfluous to the plot, and his characterization is more than a little racist. The fact Sixteen Candles can survive his useless, offensive scenes is a testament to just how strong is the rest of the movie.",4,"""This is the single worst day of my entire life.""",1073952000,"01 13, 2004",2004,2243,"['Samantha', 'Baker', 'Molly', 'Ringwald', 'having', 'worst', 'day', 'life', 'entire', 'family', 'including', 'heartless', 'parents', 'have', 'forgotten', 'sixteenth', 'birthday', 'stuck-up', 'sister', 'getting', 'married', 'tomorrow', 'hunk', 'dreams', 'Jake', 'Ryan', 'Michael', 'Shoeffling', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'alive', 'so', 'going', 'Caroline', 'Mulford', 'shallow', 'beautiful', 'Big', 'Blond', 'Campus', 'Haviland', 'Morris', 'top', 'sawed-off', 'geek', 'delusions', 'coolness', 'Anthony', 'Michael', 'Hall', 'hots', 'her.In', 'typical', 'movie', 'hunk', 'would', 'be', 'totally', 'unable', 'appreciate', 'Sam', 'breaking', 'own', 'heart', ""'d"", 'realize', 'cute', 'lovable', 'geek', 'was', 'really', 'guy', 'John', 'Hughes', 'writer', 'first-time', 'director', 'plays', 'expectation', 'making', 'Jake', 'sensitive', 'decent', 'looking', 'stable', 'relationship', 'quite', 'capable', 'recognizing', 'Sam', 'good', 'material', 'same', 'Problem', 'Sam', 'so', 'shy', 'time', 'reaction', 'Jake', 'think', 'guts', 'geek', 'drooling', 'over', 'Sam', 'start', 'surprising', 'reserves', 'wisdom', 'persuasiveness', 'real', 'coolness', 'spite', 'efforts', 'getting', 'two', 'together', 'Sam', 'parents', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'loving', 'caring', 'simply', 'overwhelmed', 'insanity', 'upcoming', 'wedding', 'end', 'even', 'Caroline', 'shallow', 'beautiful', 'girlfriend', 'out', 'be', 'not', 'so', 'shallow', 'all.Molly', 'Ringwald', 'sweetly', 'charming', 'Sam', 'Michael', 'Schoeffling', 'Haviland', 'Morris', 'are', 'beautiful', 'people', 'real', 'acting', 'ability', 'deserving', 'more', 'successful', 'careers', 'movie', 'had', 'John', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'have', 'small', 'parts', 'interesting', 'see', 'what', 'looked', 'babies', 'Anthony', 'Michael', 'Hall', 'portrayal', 'pubescent', 'wannabe', 'hustler', 'movie.Really', 'only', 'major', 'negative', 'film', 'cost', 'fifth', 'star', 'character', 'Long', 'Duk', 'Dong', 'Chinese', 'exchange', 'student', 'Why', 'Long', 'Dong', 'get', 'even', 'movie', 'totally', 'superfluous', 'plot', 'characterization', 'more', 'little', 'racist', 'fact', 'Sixteen', 'Candles', 'can', 'survive', 'useless', 'offensive', 'scenes', 'testament', 'just', 'how', 'strong', 'rest', 'movie']",N/A

I still love those movies to this very day, especially ""Sixteen Candles"". Molly Ringwald as Samantha Baker who has  an unrequited crush on the most popular guy in school Jake Ryan (played by the Matt Dillon look-alike Michael Shoeffling). What makes this film hilarious is that her family forgets her birthday while they are consumed with her sister's impending nuptials, her grandparents who are staying with the family with their foreign studen exchanged student Long Duc Dong, and the geek who won't go away played by the hilarious Anthony Michael Hall. Chaos and non-stop laughs ensues. John Cusak and his sister Joan makes a cameo appearance. One of the funniest moments is when the family is about to go to the church for the wedding and they find Long Duc Dong passed out on the front lawn after a heavy night of partying. Not a very politically correct moment in cinema history but it sure is hilarious. My also favorite Long Duc Dong moment was when greets Sam from the top bunk bed in Sam's brother's room.

My friends kept telling me I was crazy. But I KNEW I remembered hearing David Bowie's ""Young Americans"" playing during the scene when the family is getting into their cars to go to the wedding near the end of the movie. That, and the song playing during the opening credits ( ""Kajagoogoo"" by the band of the same name) was changed.

Her sixteenth birthday just happens to be the day before her sister's wedding.  Unfortunately for Sam, everyone has forgotten about her birthday due to the stress of the upcoming wedding.  Sam's house is overflowing with relatives who have come in from out of town to attend the wedding.  Both sets of grandparents have arrived, and Sam has been kicked out of her room.  One set of grandparents have brought along a Chinese foreign exchange student whom they have been sponsoring.  His name is Long Duc Dong (Gedde Watanabe). Sam's grandmother seems to think it would be a good idea for Long to accompany Sam to her school dance, so off they go.Meanwhile, Sam is being pursued by ""the geek"", played by Anthony Michael Hall.  He has been coming on very strong, but its all an act to be cool in his friends' eyes.  Sam has a crush of her own.  His name is Jake Ryan (Justin Henry).  Sam revealed her feelings about Jake on a ""sex test"" that one of her friends gave her.  Jake gets ahold of the test and immediately becomes intrigued with meeting Sam.  However, he's dating the most popular girl in the school, but, according to Jake, all she likes to do is party.  True to her form, she organizes a huge party at Jake's house, only to get so drunk that she passes out.  Jake asks the geek to drive her safely home, but more happened than just driving.  Will Jake and Sam end up together?  Will Sam's parents realize that they forgot her birthday?I can remeber seeing this movie when I was in high school, and its just as I remember it.  Gedde Watanabe's portrayal of Long Duc Dong is the highlight of the movie.  John and Joan Cusack even have bit parts.  The cool soundtrack of great 80s songs is excellent as well.  I highly recommend this movie.  The acting is very good, especially by Hall and Watanabe, and the story is very funny.  I'm sure that many people have had their family forget their birthday.

Maybe getting felt up by your grandmother is enough to scar you forever, but isn't that what life is all about? Scars?This movie goes much deeper than your average teen comedy. The social, political, and religious undertones are far too prominent, yet never discussed. Farmer Ted may have reached the supreme peak his kind could, but without the Polaroid, he might as well had just bought the floopy disks!In the shower scene, the breasts are not only shown in their natural splendor, but are celebrated and demand to be worshipped. The loud, single drum instantly forces you to look at the screen and whether you are male or female, you cannot look away. Perfection needs not be appreciated, but worshipped. Samantha knew this. She did not really want Jake, she wanted Carolyn! Yes that's right, her entire plan backfired when she wound up with Jake and not Carolyn on the table. Oh what a happy ending we were denied. I always imagine Sam and Carolyn kissing then having a giggle fest as they cover themselves with cake frosting.Farmer Ted, King of the Dipsh*ts as he calls himself is really the future. You don't have to be Nostradomas to see the identical qualities between Ted and G.W. Bush. We were warned, we tried to fight the system, but our history was written long before the voting booths opened.The 'Jock Strap' Twins. Remember these derelicts on the bus? The ones with the Laser Tag guns? They represented Jesus and the Devil. Everyday you are bombarded with sin, temptation, corruption, good deeds, sorrow, and joy. They hit you like a laser tag ray. A 'direct hit' is scored by both sides, but who will you succumb to. I don't agree with the movie's answer of just getting off the bus and ignoring both, the front yard is certainly not Purgatory.'Headgear Girl'. It should be obvious to anyone that this character represents the Florida Agriculture Commision of 1993. Remember the water fountain scene and the 'Ah, yeah.' on the bus? Now put two and two together. See what I mean? John Hughs is a true seer. If only we had paid attention.And last we have Jake the Lion hearted. He is Desperation, The Fifth Horseman of the Apocalypse. The ugly sweater, the Rolls Royce, the sheepish voice when talking to grandparents on the phone. What we never saw was the lunchbox. Here is where executives got nervous and thought John was taking his film too far. The two scenes with Jake carrying his lunchbox were deleted, (and rumored to have been destroyed so there was no way they'd EVER be discovered). The lunchbox depicted the double murder of the Bordens at the hand of their daughter Lizzie (yes I know it was her step-mother stay with me here). John was hired by Madagascar agents to give them a message through this movie, and the lunchbox was the clue. You have to remember this was during the 80's and the Evil Empire of the Soviet Union loomed over us like Death. Supposedly, the clue had something to do with an alliance between Egypt and the Republic of Chad.So the question remains, does a girl want a pink one or a black one?",5,Dong!

The DVD, sad to say, is less than stellar and warrants only a 3 max, which is why a newer version is sorely needed for all of us who cherish this fine ensemble winner of a movie.Stuck in the maze of adolescence, Samantha (Ringwald) is celebrating her 16th birthday at the same exact time her loopy sister gets married.  Her family is up in arms with last minute to do lists and unscheduled cat-fights, in-fights, and bizarre in-laws (including dueling grandmothers, racist/sexist grandfathers, and drop dead hysterical adopted Asians - Gedde Wattanabe in a wonderful comedic performance!)  To top everything off, Samantha is in love with Jake (a hottie of epic proportions) but adamantly persued by a nerd to end all nerds (Anthony Michael Hall who was never - ever - better!).  Between the grandparents' landing at the family's house, the silliness surrounding a disaster-prone party at Jakes house, and the shennanigans between two breaskfast-making grandmothers - and one long ashed cigarette poised to ruin the eggs - Samantha faces her special day alone, heartbroken, and embarrassed by all the dim-witedness that surrounds her.Sam is easily Hughes' best heroine, and Ringwald pulls her off like a charm.  She's sincere yet sarcastic, in the manner that only a teenager can really deliver.  ANd the cast is delectable, with the previously named Wattanabe stealing every scene he's in.  Best of all though has to be the wedding scene, with a skunk-drunk bride with menstral cramps swallows muscle relaxers and literally walks, trips, slobbers and slides down the aisle.

The only problem is that he has a rich, popular girlfriend, and there is a geek who keeps following her around - at all the wrong times.Of course she doesn't think that he even knows she exists, so when the ""geek"" lets her know that this guy had asked about her, she doesn't know what to do - and so she winds up acting like ""a total geek"" every time he's around.There are so many other little story lines going on that it's hard to describe it all here.

It brings back SOoooo many highschool memories of the ""in-crowd"", and what it felt like not to be a part of this group.I don't want to ruin the ending for you - in case you never saw it - but it ends in classic Molly Ringwald fashion, so you can't help but remember it forever!Overall, I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys teenage romance movies, as well as those who grew up during the 80's (it will feel like you're in a time warp!).",5,Another Great 80's Movie!!!,1121558400,"07 17, 2005",2005,1786,"['have', 'not', 'yet', 'purchased', 'particular', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'writing', 'review', 'based', 'movie', 'saw', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'have', 'watched', '30', 'times', 'late', 'night', 't.v', 'then', ""'ll"", 'write', 'DVD', 'edition', 'once', 'receive', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'then', 'add', 'movie', 'Listmania', 'list', 'Favorite', 'Movies', 'Sixteen', 'Candles', 'great', 'Molly', 'Ringwald', 'movie', 'classic', '1980', 'was', 'teenager', 'time', 'movies', 'were', 'staple', 'reason', ""'ve"", 'NEVER', 'forgotten', 'Sixteen', 'Candles', 'middle', 'class', 'girl', 'who', 'be', 'neither', 'overly', 'popular', 'one', 'dorks', 'who', 'major', 'crush', 'one', 'rich', 'popular', 'kids', 'only', 'problem', 'rich', 'popular', 'girlfriend', 'geek', 'who', 'following', 'wrong', 'times.Of', 'course', ""n't"", 'think', 'even', 'so', 'when', 'geek', 'know', 'guy', 'had', 'asked', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'so', 'up', 'acting', 'total', 'geek', 'time', 'around.There', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'little', 'story', 'lines', 'going', 'hard', 'describe', 'here', 'Suffice', 'say', 'are', 'many', 'hysterical', 'moments', 'where', 'laugh', 'till', 'cheeks', 'hurt', 'many', 'others', 'where', 'heart', 'out', 'poor', 'teen', 'back', 'SOoooo', 'many', 'highschool', 'memories', 'in-crowd', 'what', 'felt', 'not', 'be', 'part', 'group.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'ruin', 'ending', 'case', 'never', 'saw', 'classic', 'Molly', 'Ringwald', 'fashion', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'remember', 'forever', 'Overall', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'teenage', 'romance', 'movies', 'as', 'well', 'who', 'grew', 'up', '80', 'will', 'feel', ""'re"", 'time', 'warp']",N/A

It's so funny and fun and it stars two of the best from the 80's brat pack - Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall.Molly Ringwalds character, Samantha, is about to turn 16 just at the exact same time her older sister is about to get married.  In all the commotion, her birthday is forgotten and ruined.  Her grandparents (so cute) come to stay at their house and bring along a hilarious Asian exchange student with them.  She is forced to go along to the school dance (and take the exchange student with her) and there at the dance, Anthony Michael Hall (king of the nerds) has a wager with his nerd friends (including a very young John Cusack) that he can get her pants by the end of the night and will show them to all the nerds in the bathroom.  There is actually a very tender scene in a car at the 'car workshop' classroom where he and Sam have a bit of a heart to heart.  She reveals her secret crush (Jake - the hottest guy in school).  One thing leads to another and the rest of the movie is spent with the 'will they, won't they get together'.With a predictable ending (albeit happy and fun), this is a great movie that I never get tired of.  Long Duc Dong (the exchange student) steals every scene he is in.  He is so funny (fans of ER got to see him again as he had a minor role each week for a long while back).

She portrayed our fears, she portrayed our hopes, and she even portrayed our dreams.  For a few years Molly Ringwald was the darling of the teenage movie, making three particularly enjoyable movies, ""Pretty in Pink,"" ""The Breakfast Club,"" and ""Sixteen Candles.""  In ""Sixteen Candles,"" we see one of the greatest fears a child can ever have, that your family forgets your birthday; worse, your sixteenth birthday.  Things can only get worse from here.Unfortunately for Samantha (Ringwald) her sister is getting married, and the entire family focuses on her sister.  Unfortunately for Samantha, that means everyone has forgotten her birthday.  To make matters worse, relatives have taken over her bedroom.  Early in the movie we meet Samantha's grandparents, and one grandmother notes with glee that Samantha seems to have gotten perky, and takes a firm squeeze to prove it.  This movie only gets funnier from here.We soon learn of the geeks on the bus, including Farmer Ted, well played by Anthony Michael Hall.  Ted has two friends (one of whom is John Cusack) that seem beyond being geeks.  The things these two do involve jock straps, weird helmets and cameras.  Farmer Ted has a crush on Samantha and acts as gawky, awkward and plain silly as we did the first time we approached a girl.  Well, maybe Ted is worse.  Anyway, Samantha is only interested in Jake Ryan (Michael Schoeffling), who seems to have eyes only for the stereotypical hot high school femme fatale Caroline Mulford (Haviland Morris).  Naturally Caroline is very status conscious and very possessive of Jake.All the elements are in place for the highlight of the movie, a party in which Caroline gets drunk, Ted and Chinese foreign exchange student Long Duk Dong (Gedde Watanabe) get lucky, and drunk, and Samantha and Jake perhaps begin the start of something wonderful.  I will leave you to watch the details.There are a few weak moments in the movie.  In a few cases the weakness is because we have become more sensitive.  In other cases perhaps our discomfort is from the movie hitting too close to our own personal reality.What makes this movie special is how it manages to make teenage life in the 1980s funny without belittling teenagers.  Life for teenagers has always been difficult (in spite of what the current crop might believe), and to be able to look back as an adult at an accurate portrayal of how we remember being a teenager is wonderful.

203176,A3AYDEWU1EPF15,6300183467,Luis Hernandez,"[0, 3]","Considered to be one of the teen classics of the 1980's, &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; marked John Hughes directorial debut in the genre of teenage films. Starring teen queen Molly Ringwald, &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; chronicles a special day in the life of Samantha, a teenage girl residing in Shermer, Illinois. Due to all the hoopla that has overtaken her household because of her sister's impending marriage, everyone has forgotten about Samantha's 16th birthday.At school, Samantha is given a secret exam by a friend that delves into her deepest thoughts, especially when the topic is boys. When the test accidentally falls into the hands of her prince charming, Jake Ryan (played wonderfully by Paul Dooley) Samantha's life will forever change. Pestered by the school geek (Anthony Michael Hall) Samantha discovers that all good things come to those who wait.While Dooley went into obscurity, many of the film's stars went on to become well-known actors and directors. Keep an eye out for a young John Cusack (&quot;Being John Malkovich&quot;) as one of Anthony Michael Hall's friends, Betty Thomas (director of the &quot;Brady Bunch&quot; movies and former &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; star) as Samantha's mother, and Justin Henry (the young Oscar-nominee of &quot;Kramer vs. Kramer&quot; fame) as Samantha's obnoxious little brother. Ringwald's really life-sister, Beth, plays her younger sister in the film.I loved the film, however when Universal Home Video chose Image Entertainment to transfer some of their most popular films onto DVD, a lot of the special features found on average DVD's were not included. With the exception of chapter selections, there are no trailers, actor bios, animated menus, language selections, or anything else to make this DVD version extraordinary. However this films was one of the best films of the 1980's due to its' charms and great young cast. I seriously miss Molly Ringwald, and only wished that the adorable Paul Dooley could have become a bigger-name star. The ending where Dooley shows up at the church where the wedding takes place and surprises Samantha is so wonderful that I have to watch it over and over again.&quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; is a true classic in the genre of teenage films.

203177,A26ZSYRPA1TCI5,6300183467,Marc Dalesandro,"[10, 10]","""Sixteen Candles"" is my second-favorite movie of all time. Just getting that out in the open right away.In my opinion, this movie is the best teen comedy ever. The writing is crisp, the memorable lines are plentiful, the characterizations are spot-on (as someone who was in high school in the 80s, I can vouch for them).Molly Ringwald turns in a great performance, Anthony Michael Hall does likewise, and even John Cusack is enjoyable here (for once).John Hughes went on to make several more 80s masterpieces, but to me ""Sixteen Candles"" is the epitome of the great 80s teen movie. From the storyline, to the one-liners, to the awesome soundtrack, this is a warm-hearted comedy that can be watched again and again.There is no villain in ""Sixteen Candles"", just the slings and arrows of teenage life's outrageous fortune. They don't make movies like this anymore.P.S. To the reviewer below me: I have no problems fast-forwarding the ads at the beginning of the movie.

203180,A1URXSRV6WDHVY,6300183467,Marty Gillis,"[2, 2]","'Sixteen Candles' is on my personal all time top 20 list and to me ranks as the great John Hughes' very best film alongside 'Plains, Trains and Automobiles' ..  I just never tire of the characters, the music and of course Long Duk Dong!  This is a movie from the 80's that has stood the test of time and I enjoy more with each viewing.  With that said, this review will focus mainly on the audio/picture quality and not the film itself.So is 'Sixteen Candles' on Blu Ray a worthy upgrade from VHS or your DVD copy? IN a single world YES YES YES! (ok, I used 3 words)This film comes to Blu Ray in glorious 1080p/24 and sports a very good transfer. No, it is not perfect. There is SOME edge enhancement and a bit of DNR (probably needed to spruce up the source) but overall it is just great. Fans of this film will be more than pleased at what they see. (and hear, but we'll get to that a bit later)Colors are nice and bright without crossing the line, flesh tones for the most part look right on the money and no messing around has been done to the original color timing which is always a big plus in my book.  Plenty of detail is present along with a nice thin layer of film grain (the good kind) and the entire film looks great in motion.  This is another winner from Universal after so many misses in the last few years of sub par catalog releases.Simply put, this is the very best 'Sixteen Candles' has ever looked for home video or is likely to in the foreseeable future.  Better than female extraterrestrial? You betcha!OK, the picture really rocks (given the source and not being a top drawer title) but how about the audio?  The sound here is a very nice DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix.  Dialogue is right in the center where it belongs and very clear and well defined. The music is in stereo, sometimes split into the surrounds and honestly 'Sixteen Candles' SOUNDS quite a bit better than you might think possible. This film was originally mixed in mono and unlike some older titles with surround mixes that sound forced or fake, it seems the post mixers had access to the original audio elements and really did a nice job on this. A few foley/sound effects sound a bit canned but hey ALWAYS sounded that way.  The audio quality is a good 1/2 notch above the video, which is no slouch to begin with.  In other words, the sound on this is VERY GOOD folks.  Frankly it has never sounded better, not even during it's initial theatrical run.Special features are a bit sparse but you do get a short 10 part documentary featuring cast and crew. Sadly Molly Ringwald did not participate and it is in SD. Also included are two short HD promotional blurbs for Universal, trumpeting their 100 year anniversary releases.  But hey, you bought this for the actual MOVIE right? And it totally delivers the goods in that respect!Bottom line: If you LOVE Sixteen Candles and have a decent HDTV , Blu Ray player and Sound System then you are gonna LOVE this disc.

Previous to this, I've seen The Breakfast Club, Pretty In Pink and Planes, Trains & Automobiles, which I think gets funnier/sadder the more you watch it, but Sixteen Candles was one of those films that everyone who watches it, will see themselves in. I remember being sweet sixteen , fancying the most popular guys in school, being ignored, although I didn't have the problem of my family forgetting my birthday.Molly Ringwald was the darling of the eighties, along with the rest of the Brat Pack at the time, but she seems to have virtually disappeared right now. She seems to be mostly on TV in the US at the moment, and hasn't appeared in a movie in ages. She could have been one of the big Hollywood names, but for some reason, she dropped out of filming Some Kind Of Wonderful, which went to Lea Thomspon, and ended her run of films with John Hughes.Sixteen Candles is about a 16-year-old girl, who has to go to school on her birthday, knowing her family are too wrapped up in her older sister's wedding to remember their daughter is sweet sixteen. She's mad about one of the most popular guys in school, but instead, gets hassled by a geeky guy, who gets her knickers, so he pretend to his gang that they got up to no good. It's quite predictable, but quite sweet at the same time. Molly Ringwald suited these kinda roles perfectly, and unlike the 'teen' stars of today, she was actually 16 when the film was released.The best thing about this film were the scene-stealing roles from John & Joan Cusack. Joan was only credited as Geek Girl #1, but manages to steal the few scenes she's in. She wears a head brace thing, and was hilarious trying to drink water from a water fountain. I don't think she has any lines, but hey, she was brilliant!Sixteen Candles is one movie to be picked up if you want to relive your school days, and feel like the geek one more time.

She tries to carry on and make the most of her day, but she is thwarted by a geek (Anthony Michael Hall), her snobby sister's wedding, and wild foriegn exchange student Long Duck Dong (Gedde Watanabe).There is plenty of deep dialogue about love and relationships in this first directing stint by John Hughes, 80's genius.  But there are also some madcap moments and scenes of a raging teenage party.  It was just nice to see a funny love story where the invisible girl gets her prince charming in the end.

She is turning sixteen, and no one, not her parents or even her grandparents, remember this is her birthday as her sister is getting married the next day and who will have an interesting honeymoon due to her being on her period on the time.  The film follows Molly Ringwold, Anthony Michael Hall as the Geek, and Justin Henry as Jake Ryan, the heart throb.  I am a firm believer that Hughes' teenage films have lasted as long as they have due to their universal accessibility.There are some things I will never understand, like how ""Sixteen Candles"" managed to get a PG rating.  Back in 1984, they had no PG-13 rating.  I knew Speilberg spearheaded the effort to get a PG-13 rating, largely due to his own films, ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" and ""The Gremlins"" which should have merited a PG-13 rating if one had existed when these films were released.  I never heard ""Sixteen Candles"" mentioned in this same discussion, and without a doubt, I would argue ""Sixteen Candles"" should be rated R.Watching the unedited ""Sixteen Candles"" on HBO, I was rather shocked at what Hughes got away with here.  There are numerous profanities laced throughout, including two instances of ""f--"".  The biggest shocker for a PG movie though is the shower scene, which shows a closeup of Caroline Mulford's breasts and then a standing shot of her nude in the show.  This scene right here should have merited an R rating.[""Sixteen Candles"" is yet another masterful teenage tour de force by John Hughes. ] I saw an interview with Kevin Smith one time about how Hughes was an absolute master of crafting piercing, stunning dialogue, and this film is one of the premier examples of Hughes' skill as a dialogue artist.  Some of the best lines from his career (and the ouevre of 1980s cinema as well) come from this film.  Probably the best is ""Can I borrow your underpants for ten minutes?""  The Geek to Samatha, in order to prove his masculinity to his two friends (including a young John Cusack), and The Geek talking about ""interfacing"" with Samantha (By night's end, I predict me and her will interface).  We have the infamous foreign exchange student, Long Duk Dong.  Too Hughes' credit, Duk was not a throwaway joke for the name, but has some quite funny moments.""Sixteen Candles"" is yet another masterful teenage tour de force by John Hughes. Although the music may have changed, high school certainly hasn't.  Decades after his primary work has concluded, we as the audience can still relate to the hell of riding on the bus, a growing preoccupation for romance, [adjusting to sex and] discovering sex and working out the inevitable changes that sex brings to adolescent, dealing with pre-defined ""roles"" assigned to us by others and ourselves, and dealing with bizaare family situations.""The Breakfast Club"" (made a year after ""Sixteen Candles"") thoroughly explores the high school labels of jock, the popular girl, the geek, the rebel, and the social outcast.  Although not to the same extent, the characters of ""Sixteen ""Candles"" are likewise fighting through their own labels for deeper and more meaniful lives and better understanding..You get the sense that Hughes is tapping into archetypes: Anthony Michael Hall's character doesn't even get an actual name.  He is just ""The Geek"" or the derisive ""Farmer Ted"".  We've all known the weird geeks with their rough edges.  We've all known the Jake Ryans of the world - the popular jock who is actually deeper than he appears, with his star-studded, ultra hot girlfriend and who is the most popular couple in school.  We all can relate to the love triangle between Jake, his girl friend, and Samantha (who is a sophomore, and therefore by definition hopeless to attract Jake, who is, after all, a SENIOR).  We've all been ignored by our families on what should be momentous occasions (such as a sixteenth birthday).  We've all had to struggle through those weird family social gatherings, such as the trainwreck that is Samantha's sister's wedding.  We've all had those older, wiser, more socially adept friends who seem one step ahead of us.One of my favorite moments was where the Geek tried to get evidence he is with Caroline and so gets his buddies to take a picture.  The picture comes out as a crappy snapshot of only the Geek's face - completely useless in regards to the original intent of the picture in the first place!  Likewise, we can see certain fantasies fulfilled.  The Geek gets the hot girl in the end.  Jake shows up and we see some sparks between him and Samantha.We also have the weird family dynamics that sadly for many do not end after the adolescent years for so many.  In the backdrop of the movie Samantha's family is preparing for the wedding, which gives us quite a bit of fodder for oddity.  Probably one of the creepiest moments in weird families is when Samantha gets ""felt up"" by her Grandma in front of her Grandpa.Fortunately, however, Paul Dooley (as Jim Baker) really humanizes Samantha's father, and there are a handful of touching moments between Ringwold and Dooley that show their relationship is quite solid.  Jim Baker is not the bumbling, disaster prone Clark W. Griswold of the Vacation series; he has deep affection for his children and wants them to succeed.For those concerned about the soundtrack, the DVDs from the 1990s did alter the soundtrack, but the recent releases from post 2000 have the original music.Although it's not one of those movies you can watch with young kids (the PG rating is SO MISLEADING), you would be amiss not to watch ""Sixteen Candles"" if you love John Hughes, 1980s movies, or teenage stories.",5,I can't believe it!

203192,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,6300183467,mirasreviews,"[1, 2]","Teen movies since the mid-1990s seem to be aimed at audiences other than teenagers. There are the improbable tragicomedies about dating that depict high school as pre-teens would imagine it, a grander, racier version of junior high school. And there are the films that pretend to realism by making teens out to be childish and innocuous, the way that middle-aged people like to imagine them. With some art house exceptions, the characters resemble aliens more than they do any young people who ever lived. This unfortunate state of cinema made me think more kindly of the second-tier teen flicks of the 1980s that didn't capture my interest the first time around. ""Sixteen Candles"" is one of those.Written and directed by John Hughes in 1984, ""Sixteen Candles"" preceded his more sophisticated and thoughtful teen classics ""The Breakfast Club"" and ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"". But ""Sixteen Candles"" rings true to the culture of upper-middle class suburban teens in the 1980s. The simple, silly premise sets up a funny two days in the life of one frustrated young woman. Samantha Baker's (Molly Ringwald) family has forgotten her 16th birthday amid preparations for her sister's wedding. She has a crush on handsome senior Jake Ryan (Michael Schoeffling) but seems only to attract the attentions of a persistent nerd (Anthony Michael Hall). Sam's grandparents have moved into her bedroom, and she' s been saddled with their exchange student (Gedde Watanabe).""Sixteen Candles"" enjoys teenagers and sympathizes with them. In this case, angst stems from being ignored on one hand and harassed on the other. The characters are genuine and nice and flawed and self-aware, a welcome relief from the current trend to portray teens as either stupid or dangerous. Those who lived through the 1980s will recognize some teen staples, like ""open parties"". Those who didn't might be pleasantly surprised by an era when parents were respectful, not controlling, toward their children and people worried a lot less. ""Sixteen Candles"" is more of a ""chick flick"" than some of John Hughes other teen movies, as it has a female lead. But it's a fun blast from the past.

Combine all the elements of this movie of teen angst, social class, hilariously embarrassing family antics, and weird friends, and you have your madcap adventures laid out.Molly Ringwald, the queen of 80s teen movies, plays Sam, an overly eager but insecure teenager who awakens on the dawn of her 16th birthday to meet rejection after rejection when it should be a happy day.  Her sister is getting married the next day, and her whole family seems to have forgotten with the chaos of the wedding plans.  So, Sam goes off to school and pouts to her friend about it.  In a not so typical situation, Sam lets a note drop into the wrong hands and lets a rather embarrassing sex test note (of which I never understood why she would fill out even if her name wasn't on it) fall into the hands of the most handsome boy in school, a pre Luke Perry heartthrob, Jake Ryan.  Instead of the prince, she gets the frog, The Geek, chasing after her - which would become Anthony Michael Hall's signature role which he has never been able to live down.  In subplots, we see the antics of the exchange student, the other nerds, the goings on at the wild party and school dance, and the wedding - which if you ask me is one of the funniest wedding scenes ever captured on film.I relaize now how many fantasy aspects this movie has, especially the Jake Ryan character.  Jake is a pretty nice guy, and when I say ""nice"" he boarders on saint.  When he intercepts the note from Sam with his name all over it, he doesn't spread it around like a vain, self centered poster boy he otherwise is, but spares her the embarassment and keeps it to himself.  When he catches her staring at him, he smiles back rather than giving her a sneer or a dirty look.  Even when he his given a really embarrassing pair of her panties, he holds onto them and gives them back to her to spare her further humiliation provided by The Geek.  And he even realizes that his girlfriend, Miss Good Time Charlene, is just a vain, shallow party girl and he is looking for someone with more substance.The Geek, though less mature and far underappreciated by Sam, is a sweet guy despite his wants to be liked.  He does ask her to give him her underwear to help his social status, and he plays the happy, bumbling fool to a T.  Perhaps he too will be as noble as Jake someday.  In the meantime, he also cares enough for Sam that he'd rather she be happy than sad.  And the end, who isn't a softy for that ending scene with Sam and Jake over that birthday cake?

Among them, &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; is vintage Hughes.  It follows Ms. Ringwald on her quest to gain the interest of the most popular boy at school (Justin Henry)who - no, can it be?!? - turns out to be a nice guy at heart.  The screenplay pulled out all the stops for comedy and sweetness and the film - all hype and nonsense - brilliantly captures that snapshot of 80's Americana in which every teenager within viewing distance desperately wanted to fit in.TRANSFER: Universal's anamorphically enhanced DVD is a disappointment.  The film suffers from faded colors, low contrast, weak black levels, color bleeding and an incredible loss of fine detail in the image throughout. Flesh tones are pasty. Age related artifacts including chips, scratches and jump cuts in editing are glaringly obvious.  In addition - night scenes suffer from a near blackout characteristic in which a completely dark viewing room is needed just to get by.  The audio, remixed to 5.1 in Dolby and DTS is barely stereo, with no separation among the channels except in its music tracks.EXTRAS: NOTHING!

It has lost none of its endearing comedy and heart-tugging sentiment.As a child of the late 80s and early 90s, this film was beyond entertaining. Molly Ringwald as Samantha Baker was so authentic, as a teen whose sixteenth birthday goes unnoticed as her somewhat chaotic family prepares for her older sister's wedding. A quartet of grandparents arrive, much to her chagrin (""I can't believe my grandmother actually felt me up!""), one set which brings a Korean exchange student in tow. On top of this, she easily has the most smart-mouthed, obnoxious little brother on the face of the earth (the superb Justin Henry), who delivers the best sarcastic one-liners, some sample lines: ""Dad, I didn't hit her! I'd like to very much, and I probably will later, but you know my method! I don't hit her when you're just down the hall!"" ""Hey, birth defect!"" and ""I wouldn't go in there, if I were you! Grandpa Fred was in there for half and hour - it's totally polluted!""Then there's school, sweet school. The guy of her dreams, the hunky Jake Ryan (the gorgeous Michael Schoeffling)is the property of the prom queen Caroline (Havilland Morris), while Sam has to fend off the attention of resident geek, Farmer Ted (Anthony Michael Hall, brilliant), and show exchange student Dong around town. Some of the best scenes occur during the school dance, with Sam failing to get a dance with Jake, Farmer Ted attempting to make it with her (but they end up having an interesting conversation instead), Dong finding a girlfriend, and then it cuts to the seedy restaurant where Sam's parents (Paul Dooley and Carlinn Glinn) and sister Ginny (Blanche Baker) meet with her slightly sleazy fianc&eacute;e Rudy (John Kapelos) and soon to be in-laws with the love theme from ""The Godfather"" playing in the background.""Dong's here for five hours, and he's got somebody. I live here my whole life, and I'm like a disease!"" Sam sulks for the rest of the evening, until her folks finally remember her birthday. More is going on - Dong's at a party at Caroline's house, where everything's getting pretty rowdy, and Jake tires of this endless cycle, and tries to call Sam, not knowing that her grandparents are sleeping in her bedroom (let's just say it's very interesting). After the prom queen passes out, and sub-humans have departed, Jake and Farmer Ted having a touchingly humorous heart-to-heart, with the classic Frank Sinatra tune, ""Strangers In The Night"" as a musical backdrop. There are some very funny revelations and situations that I wouldn't dream of giving away.All the actors excel in their roles, which seem tailor-made for them. Sam's dreams come true, something every teen girl dreams of - the boy you crush on, who seems unobtainable, miraculously notices you, and you're on cloud nine . . . . . . And I love Paul Dooley's speech to Sam after he remembers her birthday!!!!John Hughes gets his target audience: he obviously hasn't forgot what it's like to experience teen angst, and he gives it the most humorous and charming touch!!!

The difference is, this one makes  you smile.  Unlike the recent rash of teen movies, ""Sixteen Candles"" is a  genuine classic supported by strong acting and a heartfelt plot.  John  Hughes, the master of 80s teen movies, is able to translate adolescent  frustrations into more than flimsy emotions and juvenille infatuation.  His  engaging storytelling gives significance to the problems of the Shermer, IL  high schoolers rather than diminishing them; whereas today, we roll our  eyes at Freddie Prinze Jr.'s latest romantic caper and at Sarah Michelle  Gellar's sexual trysts because there's little soul buried beneath their  appearances.  Even the fairy tale-like ending, which I normally would  lambaste, doesn't seem far-fetched because we care about these  people.Kudos to the cast for creating such honest characters to frame  the story.  Everyone will enjoy Molly Ringwald's performance as new sixteen  year-old Samantha Baker.  Any high school girl can sympathize with her  jumbled feelings of loneliness, inadequacy, self-importance, and, of  course, puppy love.  Samantha is wonderful to watch because she talks and  acts like a teenager instead of a stereotype of a teenager.  Anthony  Michael Hall is also memorable as the lovable dork who tries to be suave  around an older girl, and fails miserably (how many of those have we  known?).  Also look for elfin John and Joan Cusack who make minor  appearances.My one reserve for this movie is the offensive, and very  unnecessary, charicature of an Asian foreign student whose only impact is  an uncompelling subplot.  That blunder aside, ""Sixteen Candles"" accurately  portrays teen angst and uncertainty with a great deal of sensitivity.

203206,A1GN8UJIZLCA59,6300183467,P Magnum,"[24, 26]","Sixteen Candles takes place basically over the course of one day when a family forgets the sweet sixteenth birthday of one daughter amid the preparations for the oldest daughter's wedding. The sixteen year old is played by the 80's teen queen Molly Ringwald. It was the movie that helped her gain that title and is the best of her career. She plays the role of Samantha Baker with ease and charm. We feel all her range of emotions from the hurt of being forgotten to the longing she feels for a boy, Jake Ryan, who she has a major crush on but doesn't think he knows that she's alive. Little does Samantha know that Jake wants to meet her and the movie goes through a series of near misses between the two. Anthony Michael Hall plays &quot;The Geek&quot; who is constantly hitting on Samantha. He acts like he is a man of the world, but really is full of hot air. Mr. Hall is extremely funny and the scenes where he gives Jake advice on women and eventually drives the prom queen home in Jake's father's Roll Royce are priceless. Both sets of Samantha's grandparents are funny, one set are the worriers and the other the carefree sort. Gedde Wannabe is funny as an exchange student who comes with one of the grandparents. He does take the Asian stereotypes to the max but he comes across with a nice degree of charm. John and Joan Cusack show up in bit parts and the movie has a great soundtrack. The Thompson Twins' &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; perfectly frames the ending scene where Jake and Samantha finally hook up. Sixteen Candles was the directorial debut of John Hughes and set the stage for the Brat Pack movies that would be the dominant teen movies of the 80's. Unlike his other movies like The Breakfast Club, Pretty In Pink or Some Kind Of Wonderful, Sixteen Candles isn't full of teen angst, self-examination and skepticism that the others are. It is a charming look at the life of a teenager that seems to actually be real.  The new version restores the original soundtrack and improves the sound somewhat, but compared with most digitally remastered dvd's, this one isn't quite up to par.  It is definately an improvement over the original dvd version and since the first one has long been out of print, it is worthwhile just to have it back in circulation.",5,Sixteen Candles 20 Years On,1062547200,"09 3, 2003",2003,2275,"['Sixteen', 'Candles', 'place', 'basically', 'course', 'one', 'day', 'when', 'family', 'sweet', 'sixteenth', 'birthday', 'one', 'daughter', 'preparations', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'wedding', 'sixteen', 'year', 'old', 'played', '80', 'teen', 'queen', 'Molly', 'Ringwald', 'was', 'movie', 'helped', 'gain', 'title', 'best', 'career', 'role', 'Samantha', 'Baker', 'ease', 'charm', 'feel', 'range', 'emotions', 'hurt', 'being', 'forgotten', 'longing', 'boy', 'Jake', 'Ryan', 'who', 'major', 'crush', ""n't"", 'think', 'alive', 'Little', 'Samantha', 'know', 'Jake', 'meet', 'movie', 'series', 'near', 'misses', 'two', 'Anthony', 'Michael', 'Hall', 'quot', 'Geek', 'quot', 'who', 'constantly', 'hitting', 'Samantha', 'man', 'world', 'really', 'full', 'hot', 'air', 'Mr.', 'Hall', 'extremely', 'funny', 'scenes', 'where', 'Jake', 'advice', 'women', 'eventually', 'prom', 'queen', 'home', 'Jake', 'father', 'Roll', 'Royce', 'are', 'priceless', 'sets', 'Samantha', 'grandparents', 'are', 'funny', 'one', 'set', 'are', 'worriers', 'other', 'carefree', 'sort', 'Gedde', 'Wannabe', 'funny', 'exchange', 'student', 'who', 'one', 'grandparents', 'take', 'Asian', 'stereotypes', 'max', 'nice', 'degree', 'charm', 'John', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'show', 'up', 'bit', 'parts', 'movie', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'Thompson', 'Twins', 'quot', 'Wish', 'Were', 'Here', 'quot', 'perfectly', 'ending', 'scene', 'where', 'Jake', 'Samantha', 'finally', 'hook', 'up', 'Sixteen', 'Candles', 'was', 'directorial', 'debut', 'John', 'Hughes', 'set', 'stage', 'Brat', 'Pack', 'movies', 'would', 'be', 'dominant', 'teen', 'movies', '80', 'other', 'movies', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'Pretty', 'Pink', 'Kind', 'Wonderful', 'Sixteen', 'Candles', ""n't"", 'full', 'teen', 'angst', 'self-examination', 'skepticism', 'others', 'are', 'charming', 'look', 'life', 'teenager', 'actually', 'be', 'real', 'new', 'version', 'original', 'soundtrack', 'sound', 'somewhat', 'compared', 'most', 'digitally', 'remastered', 'dvd', 'one', ""n't"", 'quite', 'up', 'par', 'definately', 'improvement', 'original', 'dvd', 'version', 'first', 'one', 'long', 'been', 'print', 'worthwhile', 'just', 'have', 'back', 'circulation']",N/A

I know that the difference with the original ending but something I'm having a problem with. I saw the movie when it first came out and then didn't see it until it came out on VHS a short while later. Then I didn't see it again for over 10 years until it first came out on DVD! I bought the very first release of this movie on DVD, of course which has nothing on the cover except the three of them, the rest is clean. Then I bought the 'Brat Pack Collection' and it had been a while since I saw this movie (about 10 yrs again) so I completely didn't notice the difference in the soundtracks until I read these reviews about it and decided to check them out. I played one on my TV and simultaneously played the other on my laptop. That's when I noticed the difference. I guess it was because I was so into the movie, even though I didn't watch it a lot, and I just noticed the movie.Now the first DVD I bought had more bland music, three parts I heard the difference as they were playing. The first is when Molly is getting dressed and the original had something playing I didn't know but the Brat Pack had 'Happy Birthday' (Altered Images) playing. The second I couldn't tell either but when you see the feet move in time with the beat, the music is more up from the Brat Pack. Then the last difference I noticed is when Molly goes up to see her grandparents and they are getting dressed, again I can't remember the song that was playing on the original, but the Brat Pack had the 'Twilight Zone' theme playing!So, in just the very beginning of the movie, the soundtrack was very noticibly different. I would like to know which one is the original soundtrack and which one was the replaced soundtrack from the original release? In other words, which one was the one Hughes had on the release of the movie in theaters? I still love the movie because what goes on is important to me. But the soundtrack helps make the movie and I want to keep the one that is meant for the movie and not the one that was changed. Could someone tell me which one?

203210,A2DDDKF5NZMTFY,6300183467,Regina McMenamin,"[7, 8]","Set it middle America in the mid 1980s, SIXTEEN CANDLES is the story of Samantha Baker and the day she turned 16.  Written by first time director, John Hughes and starring then teen queen Molly Ringwald, this is a must-see DVD for anyone who appreciates coming of age films.Almost like a modern day Jane Austen and the recent films that are based on her novels (Clueless), Hughes and SIXTEEN CANDLES successfully depict timeless teenage predicaments that anyone who has ever been young can relate to.SIXTEEN CANDLES takes place over the course of two days, which includes the long-awaited 16th birthday of a suburban teenage girl, whose family is too overwhelmed by their oldest daughter's pending nuptials the next day to remember the lead character's rite of passage birthday.With a soundtrack of new wave music, SIXTEEN CANDLES perfectly captures life in suburban American during the 1980s.  The cast includes Anthony Michael Hall, who plays a nerdy guy who hero-worships Ringwald's character; Justin Henry, the hunky senior whom Samantha has a crush on; and John and Joan Cusack who in small roles, play random geeky high school kids on the outskirts of the popular crowd.  There are also great performances by the two sets of grandparents who horrify Samantha Baker and the Chinese exchange student who accompanies her to a school dance.Though I have seen and enjoyed this film many times since it was first released, with older eyes and ears, I am somewhat shocked by the scene where Jake Ryan (the hunk) allows his drunken girlfriend to be pretty much raped by the Anthony Michael Hall character.  In these politically correct times, I doubt this scene would ever be included in a mass-market film.Still by masterfully capturing teen insecurities, SIXTEEN CANDLES is a fantastic film that will long be remembered as Ringwald's finest work.

Unfortunately, her own family forgets and it appears that she is going to have a miserable birthday.Additionally, the nerdy ""Farmer Ted"" (Anthony Michael Hall) has developed a crush on Sam, while Sam pines away for dreamy Jake Ryan (Michael Schoeffling), who is quite involved with the pampered princess Caroline (Havilland Morris).What makes this movie such a staple for any 80s fan is not just the John Hughes/Molly Ringwald connection, but the appearance of Anthony Michael Hall, John Cusack (in a small, but early, film role), the unforgettable Long Duck Dong and the sympathy shown to Sam's plight.  Who didn't have a crush on the most unobtainable guy in high school?  Who didn't pine away for that senior, who seemed to have it all, including the perfect girlfriend?  What girl didn't go thru high school awaiting that ""perfect"" sixteenth birthday?  Sam's problems are all-important to her, as with most teens, but Hughes doesn't gloss over it or make them seem trivial.  He sympathizes with Sam's plight and the plight of teen girls everywhere, whose biggest tragedy is not getting that car for their sixteenth birthday, or that popular guy not being interested in them.In keeping with Hughes' later films, all of the action is over the course of a day or two, so the ""problems"" are fairly quickly resolved.  Perhaps not highly realistic, but more satisfactory.Also not highly realistic, in most teen worlds, is the incredibly decent and moral character of the oh-so-popular Jake Ryan.  Would any other popular guy, upon intercepting a note naming him as Sam's biggest crush, keep that to himself?  Would he really want to dump his popular, sexually active, girlfriend because he wants more than a party?Maybe not in reality, but in a teen girl's dream world, this is EXACTLY what would happen.  And so, ultimately, ""Sixteen Candles"" is a fantasy film - - a fantasy that teen girls everywhere in the 80s ate up and made Molly Ringwald their poster girl.Highly recommended for a nostalgic look back at Molly, Anthony Michael Hall, a young John Cusack and the adorable Michael Schoeffling.",5,Staple for any 80s movie fan,1143504000,"03 28, 2006",2006,2558,"['Sixteen', 'Candles', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'collaboration', 'John', 'Hughes', 'Molly', 'Ringwald', 'started', 'very', 'profitable', 'franchise', 'Ms.', 'Ringwald', 'Mr.', 'Hughes.Ringwald', 'Samantha', 'Sam', 'Baker', 'teen', 'who', 'turning', 'sixteen', 'unfortunately', 'same', 'time', 'spoiled', 'indulged', 'fairly', 'shallow', 'older', 'sister', 'Jenny', 'Blanche', 'Baker', 'getting', 'married', 'Sam', 'up', 'birthday', 'expecting', 'body', 'blossom', 'everything', 'be', 'roses', 'Unfortunately', 'own', 'family', 'forgets', 'going', 'have', 'miserable', 'birthday.Additionally', 'nerdy', 'Farmer', 'Ted', 'Anthony', 'Michael', 'Hall', 'developed', 'crush', 'Sam', 'Sam', 'away', 'dreamy', 'Jake', 'Ryan', 'Michael', 'Schoeffling', 'who', 'quite', 'involved', 'pampered', 'princess', 'Caroline', 'Havilland', 'Morris', 'movie', 'staple', '80s', 'fan', 'not', 'just', 'John', 'Hughes/Molly', 'Ringwald', 'connection', 'appearance', 'Anthony', 'Michael', 'Hall', 'John', 'Cusack', 'small', 'early', 'film', 'role', 'unforgettable', 'Long', 'Duck', 'Dong', 'sympathy', 'shown', 'Sam', 'plight', 'Who', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'crush', 'most', 'unobtainable', 'guy', 'high', 'school', 'Who', 'did', ""n't"", 'pine', 'away', 'senior', 'who', 'seemed', 'have', 'including', 'perfect', 'girlfriend', 'What', 'girl', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'thru', 'high', 'school', 'awaiting', 'perfect', 'sixteenth', 'birthday', 'Sam', 'problems', 'are', 'all-important', 'most', 'teens', 'Hughes', ""n't"", 'gloss', 'make', 'seem', 'trivial', 'Sam', 'plight', 'plight', 'teen', 'girls', 'everywhere', 'biggest', 'tragedy', 'not', 'getting', 'car', 'sixteenth', 'birthday', 'popular', 'guy', 'not', 'being', 'interested', 'them.In', 'keeping', 'Hughes', 'later', 'films', 'action', 'course', 'day', 'two', 'problems', 'are', 'fairly', 'quickly', 'resolved', 'Perhaps', 'not', 'highly', 'realistic', 'more', 'satisfactory.Also', 'not', 'highly', 'realistic', 'most', 'teen', 'worlds', 'incredibly', 'decent', 'moral', 'character', 'oh-so-popular', 'Jake', 'Ryan', 'Would', 'other', 'popular', 'guy', 'intercepting', 'note', 'naming', 'Sam', 'biggest', 'crush', 'keep', 'Would', 'really', 'want', 'dump', 'popular', 'sexually', 'active', 'girlfriend', 'more', 'party', 'Maybe', 'not', 'reality', 'teen', 'girl', 'dream', 'world', 'EXACTLY', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'so', 'ultimately', 'Sixteen', 'Candles', 'fantasy', 'film', 'fantasy', 'teen', 'girls', 'everywhere', '80s', 'ate', 'up', 'made', 'Molly', 'Ringwald', 'poster', 'girl.Highly', 'recommended', 'nostalgic', 'look', 'back', 'Molly', 'Anthony', 'Michael', 'Hall', 'young', 'John', 'Cusack', 'adorable', 'Michael', 'Schoeffling']",N/A
203229,A1WHAJUBDQFM3Y,6300183467,Skippy McGee,"[12, 47]","I think I first watched this movie when I was 13.  I found it all right then, though the main plot line of the popular boy falling for the gawky younger girl fell a little flat even then.  Upon watching it again at the age of 20, I found several aspects of it to be offensive.  First there is the pretty horrific Asian stereotype which really isn't even funny.  It mostly reminded me of the way Michael Scott from The Office might behave if he were trying to imitate someone who was Asian.  Then there is a scene which is slightly less obvious and is therefore even more dangerous:  in it, the popular boy who the gawky girl is lusting over hands over his very drunk popular girlfriend to the geeky guy and basically says, ""Yeah man, have a good time"".  This is dangerous because it mirrors a lot of real life situations.  I mean, did they seriously not realize this was rape in the '80s?I suppose if the story was well written overall it could be salvaged in spite of these huge missteps, but like I said before, there isn't nearly enough development of the Sam/Jake story for me to really invest anything in it or find it believable.  This goes 10 times for the extremely odd pairing of the popular girl and the geek.  The dialog between them  the morning after and her break up with Jake was the sappiest, least believable tripe in the entire movie.  I'm going to basically discount all of the stereotypical high school stuff because this is probably among the movies that started all that anyway.

It's as much a staple of 1980s culture as &quot;Thriller,&quot; ColecoVision, and Saturday evening runs of &quot;Solid Gold.&quot;  In fact, &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; and its influence are so ingrained in American pop culture, every other adult in their mid-thirties is able to recite the script in their sleep.  For the uninitiated, former Brat Packer Molly Ringwald is Samantha Baker, a suburbanite whose parents blow off her sixteenth birthday because they're too preoccupied with her older sister's wedding, which takes place the next day.  High school crushes are as inevitable as acne, and Samantha has the hots for the hunky jock Jake Ryan (Michael Schoeffling), who is already attached to prima donna prom queen Carolyn (Haviland Morris).  While Samantha works up the nerve to approach Jake, she's trying to ward off the Geek (a star-making performance by Anthony Michael Hall) and his unwanted advances.  All the while this is happening, Samantha is completely bummed that her parents forgot her birthday.  I mean, a kid's sixteenth birthday is pretty major, so her frustration and angst are pretty understandable.  But no matter how well you summarize this already-familiar plot, you can't deny the fact that &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; has some of the best one-liners you will find in any film.  The humor is plumb-dumb silly but a whole lot of fun thanks to director John Hughes.  However, if &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; has revealed its age in any way, it's through its subplot with foreign exchange student Long Duck Dong (Geede Wantanabe).  The ethnic jokes border on tasteless, but it's hard not to laugh out loud at Dong's attempt to assimilate into American culture.  While &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; isn't a &quot;classic&quot; as we understand the term, it's a revered favorite that still generates chuckles from me.  I'm just disappointed that the film features music and a soundtrack that's different from the original version.  What's more, the DVD looks like a bare-bones effort with virtually no features and it has lackluster sound.

Guy gets drunk, passes out and old middle-class white people, clearly remembering how lucky we were to drop the bomb on those guys in WWII, kick him in the balls while he lies in dog pee, drunk off his ass. This generalized racism is unbearable. The wacky sexism makes me wish I could unsee this film. Screw two stars. I'm writing this before I've even gotten to the end of this slag of garbage.

John hughes lets the wedding scene go on for quite awhile, actually, and you know it must be cuz 'Ginny's' performance was so hilarious.Also the scene at the restaurant with the Rice Checks is CLASSIC.

The film is the exact picture of high school as we try to imagine it as kids, and exactly what we remember when when we are reminescing as adults.The film centers upon Molly Ringwald as we follow her around on her sixteenth birthday.  Like all girls, Samantha has been building up her sweet-sixteen birthday for most of her teenage life.  When she wakes up on the day she doesn't feel miraculously different, like she had hoped and is dismayed even further when her entire family forgets her birthday.  The day continues from there as Sam is stuck into going to a lame dance with her cousin, giving her underwear to a geek, and going to an un-tamed party.The movie is a comedy from the perspective of someone who has been there and been all of the major characters in the film.  It is full of humor, but still carries a very big heart.  It is one of those movies that you can watch 5 different times in you life, getting a different experience with every viewing.  It is the definition of a classic 80s film, and is the first film screened in the ""Teen Genre"" courses in Film School.This is a new special-edition DVD that finally includes special features such as a multi-part featurette, trailer and ""additional extras""",5,A near-perfect teen comedy,1212969600,"06 9, 2008",2008,1319,"['Sixteen', 'Candles', 'arguably', 'most', 'well', 'known', 'film', '1980s', 'John', 'Huges', 'teen-film', 'cannon', 'film', 'exact', 'picture', 'high', 'school', 'try', 'imagine', 'kids', 'exactly', 'what', 'remember', 'when', 'when', 'are', 'reminescing', 'adults.The', 'film', 'centers', 'Molly', 'Ringwald', 'follow', 'around', 'sixteenth', 'birthday', 'girls', 'Samantha', 'been', 'building', 'up', 'sweet-sixteen', 'birthday', 'most', 'teenage', 'life', 'When', 'up', 'day', ""n't"", 'feel', 'miraculously', 'different', 'had', 'hoped', 'dismayed', 'even', 'further', 'when', 'entire', 'family', 'birthday', 'day', 'there', 'Sam', 'stuck', 'going', 'lame', 'dance', 'cousin', 'giving', 'underwear', 'geek', 'going', 'un-tamed', 'party.The', 'movie', 'comedy', 'perspective', 'someone', 'who', 'been', 'been', 'major', 'characters', 'film', 'full', 'humor', 'still', 'very', 'big', 'heart', 'one', 'movies', 'can', 'watch', '5', 'different', 'times', 'life', 'getting', 'different', 'experience', 'viewing', 'definition', 'classic', '80s', 'film', 'first', 'film', 'screened', 'Teen', 'Genre', 'courses', 'Film', 'School.This', 'new', 'special-edition', 'DVD', 'finally', 'special', 'features', 'such', 'multi-part', 'featurette', 'trailer', 'additional', 'extras']",N/A
