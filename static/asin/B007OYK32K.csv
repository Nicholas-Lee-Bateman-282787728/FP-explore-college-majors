1535347,A5I5DXHUD6B6Y,B007OYK32K,Dennis,"[29, 75]","First off I'm already in very good shape and wanted to search for a yoga or flexibility/fitness program that I could supplement with my normal routine. I've tried many yoga classes and often found them boring, not that hard, and a little too spiritual for me. The ultimate yogi pretty much fulfilled all those qualities with a lot more corny qualities.First off the introduction dvd was very extremely laughable. There's a short film that I thought was a joke at first and I'd really recommend they delete that content. It shows Travis searching the streets for answers where he finds an old shop with eastern ancient books, where then a person leads him to an old man who teaches him the secrets of the universe through yoga. Sorry but this DVD is way too out there. This content will go against most Christian values and will make you question if you should even take up yoga.The workouts are not too bad if you're into moving very slow and listening to Travis talk in this very  annoying manner. I was already disappointed with the first day calling for Crosstrain and Hardcore DVDs to be performed. They both where pretty easy and again just boring. I already thought I just wasted money (good thing there's a 36 money back guarantee) The people in class also fit the stereotype of yogis. I was really distracted by one dude I think cut scars into his chest for some design. Anyways I digress. I've tried them all and find it a challenge to rely on these dvds along (for 108 days) for my exercise. And that's what I want exercise not spiritual nirvana. Again the biggest challenge was would be making through the monotony of the workouts.The books and other materials included are also a little misleading. The book is hardly a book, but more an insert to a cd. There's about a paragraph on the diet, not explained in detail at all.If you're searching for a more modern approach to yoga or a routine to increase flexibility and strength I suggest Yoga Meltdown or Bob Harper's Yoga. Both would be ideal for combination of body weight strength, cardio and increase flexibility. Another great dvd system that look comparable that AMAZON doesn't sell here is one called DDP Yoga that I've heard great things about.",3,Ok.

1535348,A31V9NOMBWPFWS,B007OYK32K,Imara219,"[17, 17]","Lots of reviews have detailed reports on each of the varying discs and workouts, so I wanted to do an overall general results review.Goals: I wanted to lose weight and tone up. I'm short and before I did Ulitmate Yogi program my workout focus was on Barre workouts. I was muscular but looked stocky because of my height. I combined the Ultimate Yogi program with extreme cardio HIIT training.Phase 1: For three months before this program, I did Kundalini Yoga series, so I had yoga experience but the pace of these DVDs are so different it takes getting used to. They are faster and the moves are a mixture of strength and flexibility. Travis does a great job of creating sequences so it does flow well together but after Day 1 of  CrossTrain I wanted to kill him and I questioned buying the DVD. I'm glad I stuck with it. By the end of week 2 on Phase 1, I was quicker, faster, and stronger. By the end of Phase 1, I moved through the Sun Saluation 36 dvd with confidence. My body was still muscular but I noticed I was trimming up. I did not lose weight, but I could tell that my body was slowly changing.Phase 2: During the beginning of Phase 2, you have a new set of DVD rotation, so the mix-up was nice. By week 3, my flexibility had increased. My body was coke body, trimmed, and lean. My muscles no longer looked stocky, but had leaned out, I hadn't lost but instead gained weight. However, I looked smaller than I had from being my smallest weight. In other words, my muscle was growing and leaning out making me look amazing.Outcome: Toned muscular lean legs, round raised booty (I had issue with the shape of my booty after the Barre workouts), strong muscular calves, toned arms, and con-caved waist. Amazing! All of those warrior poses are great lunges and the cobra poses and yoga style pushups were great for upper body.Spiritual: Travis is a warm, light spirit, at first I did my own mediation time. He has a smoothing voice and offers great advice throughout the dvds.",5,Ultimate Yogi gets you an hourglass,1385769600,"11 30, 2013",2013,1984,"['Lots', 'reviews', 'have', 'detailed', 'reports', 'varying', 'discs', 'workouts', 'wanted', 'do', 'overall', 'general', 'results', 'review.Goals', 'wanted', 'lose', 'weight', 'tone', 'up', ""'m"", 'short', 'did', 'Ulitmate', 'Yogi', 'program', 'workout', 'focus', 'was', 'Barre', 'workouts', 'was', 'muscular', 'looked', 'stocky', 'height', 'combined', 'Ultimate', 'Yogi', 'program', 'extreme', 'cardio', 'HIIT', 'training.Phase', '1', 'three', 'months', 'program', 'did', 'Kundalini', 'Yoga', 'series', 'had', 'yoga', 'experience', 'pace', 'DVDs', 'are', 'so', 'different', 'getting', 'used', 'are', 'faster', 'moves', 'are', 'mixture', 'strength', 'flexibility', 'Travis', 'great', 'job', 'creating', 'sequences', 'flow', 'well', 'together', 'Day', '1', 'CrossTrain', 'wanted', 'kill', 'questioned', 'buying', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'glad', 'stuck', 'end', 'week', '2', 'Phase', '1', 'was', 'quicker', 'faster', 'stronger', 'end', 'Phase', '1', 'moved', 'Sun', 'Saluation', '36', 'dvd', 'confidence', 'body', 'was', 'still', 'muscular', 'noticed', 'was', 'trimming', 'up', 'did', 'not', 'lose', 'weight', 'could', 'tell', 'body', 'was', 'slowly', 'changing.Phase', '2', 'beginning', 'Phase', '2', 'have', 'new', 'set', 'DVD', 'rotation', 'mix-up', 'was', 'nice', 'week', '3', 'flexibility', 'had', 'increased', 'body', 'was', 'coke', 'body', 'trimmed', 'lean', 'no', 'longer', 'looked', 'stocky', 'had', 'leaned', 'out', 'had', ""n't"", 'lost', 'instead', 'gained', 'weight', 'However', 'looked', 'smaller', 'had', 'being', 'smallest', 'weight', 'other', 'words', 'muscle', 'was', 'growing', 'leaning', 'out', 'making', 'look', 'amazing.Outcome', 'Toned', 'muscular', 'lean', 'legs', 'round', 'raised', 'booty', 'had', 'issue', 'shape', 'booty', 'Barre', 'workouts', 'strong', 'muscular', 'calves', 'toned', 'arms', 'con-caved', 'waist', 'Amazing', 'warrior', 'poses', 'are', 'great', 'lunges', 'cobra', 'poses', 'yoga', 'style', 'pushups', 'were', 'great', 'upper', 'body.Spiritual', 'Travis', 'warm', 'light', 'spirit', 'first', 'did', 'own', 'mediation', 'time', 'smoothing', 'voice', 'great', 'advice', 'dvds']",The Ultimate Yogi

I can only echo what others have already said.  Travis Eliot is an excellent instructor. He gives detailed instructions and I rarely even look at the TV as we move through the flows.  I also enjoy his life messages, motiving me to enjoy life to the fullest. The quality of the DVDs is also remarkable.  It is very evident that a lot of thought and care went into producing these.  I also had never heard of Travis before this, but now can't wait for him to release more DVDs. I would love an Ultimate Yogi 2!You can edit the program as you see fit - I replace one day a week with barre, and continue to do some elliptical and other strength on the side.There is a lot of variety in the program.  Excellent Power Yoga that includes Strength, Cardio, Balance, etc. But also balanced with Flexibility, Yin, and Gentle. Something for everyone.  The sequences also have an excellent flow and do a great job of hitting all the muscle groups. I have never done a ""program"" before and wasn't sure I would make it through - but I am now on Day 61 and loving it.I consider myself to be an advanced intermediate - I am fairly strong but not overly flexible.  I am 49 with dysplasia in one hip, and some arthritis in my other knee (not really bothering me anymore except the noise it makes when I go up stairs).

1535350,AVOWQEFO0P3B4,B007OYK32K,Kaley Quinn,"[4, 4]","I loved this program! I have practiced yoga over the years, though not on a regular basis. So I was still, in a sense, a beginner. This program has gotten me to practice on a more regular schedule. It's a 108 day program, where you have 12 different DVDs each with a different class on them, such as &#34;Cross-Train,&#34; &#34;Cardio,&#34; &#34;Yin Yoga,&#34; &#34;Strength,&#34; &#34;Flexibility,&#34; etc. Each class is quite challenging in its own way. I have not finished all 108 days yet, but already I am feeling a difference in my strength & flexibility. I also feel better mentally, more relaxed rather than stressed. Part of this program involves meditation, and I think that helps.Travis Eliot's instructions are excellent -- you always know what to do and what to do next. His cuing is clear and precise, and he gives very useful tips throughout on how to practice some of the poses. He mostly sticks with poses that are doable for beginners & intermediates -- nothing too advanced except maybe for Plow and Wheel poses, but he gives modifications (for example, he says you can stay in Bridge pose if you can't go into Wheel).The DVDs come with a handy calendar that shows you the whole schedule for 108 days and a booklet explaining each part of the program.I would recommend this for: beginners at yoga, though not total beginners (it helps to be familiar with the poses and terminology); intermediate yogis; yoga enthusiasts who would like a schedule to follow and specific classes to do.",5,Great Program,1397606400,"04 16, 2014",2014,1503,"['loved', 'program', 'have', 'practiced', 'yoga', 'years', 'not', 'regular', 'basis', 'So', 'was', 'still', 'sense', 'beginner', 'program', 'gotten', 'practice', 'more', 'regular', 'schedule', '108', 'day', 'program', 'where', 'have', '12', 'different', 'DVDs', 'different', 'class', 'such', '34', 'Cross-Train', '34', '34', 'Cardio', '34', '34', 'Yin', 'Yoga', '34', '34', 'Strength', '34', '34', 'Flexibility', '34', 'etc', 'class', 'quite', 'challenging', 'own', 'way', 'have', 'not', 'finished', 'all', '108', 'days', 'yet', 'already', 'am', 'feeling', 'difference', 'strength', 'flexibility', 'also', 'feel', 'better', 'mentally', 'more', 'relaxed', 'rather', 'stressed', 'Part', 'program', 'meditation', 'think', 'helps.Travis', 'Eliot', 'instructions', 'are', 'excellent', 'always', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'next', 'cuing', 'clear', 'precise', 'very', 'useful', 'tips', 'how', 'practice', 'poses', 'mostly', 'poses', 'are', 'doable', 'beginners', 'intermediates', 'nothing', 'too', 'advanced', 'maybe', 'Plow', 'Wheel', 'poses', 'modifications', 'example', 'can', 'stay', 'Bridge', 'pose', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'Wheel', 'DVDs', 'come', 'handy', 'calendar', 'whole', 'schedule', '108', 'days', 'booklet', 'explaining', 'part', 'program.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'beginners', 'yoga', 'not', 'total', 'beginners', 'be', 'familiar', 'poses', 'terminology', 'intermediate', 'yogis', 'enthusiasts', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'schedule', 'follow', 'specific', 'classes', 'do']",The Ultimate Yogi
1535351,A2V5R832QCSOMX,B007OYK32K,Leanne,"[21, 23]","I heard of this set when it first came out, but held off on purchasing it since I wasn't sure that I would actually follow through with doing the program.  While I love working out and have a small collection of yoga DVDs, I somehow have always put off doing yoga on a regular basis.  Flash-forward to three months ago, when a fitness forum I frequent had a thread going about the best workout DVDs people had purchased in 2012 -- and the Ultimate Yogi set was on that list again and again.  Several people in that thread said that this is the set that makes you actually do yoga - and I completely agree!Because of some hectic times at work, my husband (who is doing this with me) and I got off to a slow start with this, and it took us about about a month to get the first week under our belts.  After that, though, we were able to get into the ""flow"" of the program, and have been doing it a few nights a week.  We aren't planning on doing it every day as the program encourages people to, but, even so, have already been seeing tremendous benefits.My husband is doing this as his main form of exercise, and so far he has started to lose some weight and tone up.  I'm doing it to help with stress and sleep, and it's been amazing for that! The first night we did the Yin practice, I got nine hours of sleep, which is unheard of for me.  The nights that we do the practices, we both sleep better and feel less stressed.Another excellent feature is that Travis has excellent cueing!  There is no need to keep moving your head to look at the screen since he guides you into each pose so easily. His voice is really relaxing, and he has a nice playful tone in places.  (For instance, he calls out ""Down doooooooog!"" as he gets you to move into that pose in a very fun way.)Each practice is also very well-sequenced, and each pose moves seamlessly into the next.Here is a breakdown of the length of each DVD that I found on a different website (with my comments added to each one):* Hardcore 18 minutes (core/ab workout, meant to be done three times a week; this one just has Travis in it)* Cross Train 65 minutes* Cardio 63 minutes* Strength 65 minutes* Flexibility 72 minutes* Balance 61 minutes* Detox 72 minutes* Vitality 69 minutes* Yin Yoga 65 minutes* Gentle Yoga 56 minutes* Mountain Pose 28 minutes* Pranayama Meditation video -- 10-, 20-, and 30-minute meditations; you are supposed to start with 10 minutes of daily meditation, and then add ten-minute increments as you work your way through the 108 days* Sun Salutations -- there are three practices on this DVD, and each one is meant to be done at various points in the program -- the 36 days practice is 17 minutes, 72 days is 32 minutes, 108 days is 47 minutesOn a different note, the Ultimate Yogi people have great customer service.  I had emailed them with a question early on in the program, and they got back to me right away and were very helpful.Someone in a previous review mentioned that this UY set is too spiritual, but I don't think so at all.  Travis certainly doesn't try to proselytize, and the set seems very secular to me.If you're new to yoga or it's been awhile since you've practiced, you might want to start withYoga Foundations With Travis Eliot.  That disk comes with three practices, and you can start with Level 1 and do it for a few weeks, before you move on to the second and third levels.I'm so happy I bought this set!

Because of a torn hip cartilage, I had to really modify my workouts.  I was looking for something that would help me maintain my fitness level and the Ultimate Yogi seemed to be just the thing.  Prior to this,  I did yoga 1 to 2 days a week.  I followed the 108 day program, while also incorporating some moderate weight training and cardio.  I also followed the Common Sense Eating program.I was a little nervous staring this program since I was concerned that my wrists would bother me when I did so much yoga.  Well, after 108 days I'm happy to say I didn't have any issues.  I think it's because each yoga routine is so different that you don't overdo any one pose.My results:**I now weigh what I did in high school, for the first time since high school.  And that was a long time ago!**I am so much calmer than I used to be.  I am usually a hyper person who can't sit still and who is very impatient.  Not anymore.  When you wake up totally refreshed from a good night's sleep, or having a deep massage is the closest I can describe how I now feel.**My arms are toned like never before! There are more toned than when I was doing heavy weights.  All the body weight work in yoga really works!  Every one's body is unique and will react differently to various types of training.  Well, all the body weight work in yoga is what finally (!) gave me toned arms.  I can actually see my shoulder and triceps muscles now.Why I so love this program:**The yoga flows.  I respectfully disagree with some of the other reviewers who thought this program was too repetitive.  I felt that each routine was different so that I didn't get bored.  I especially loved how Travis structures the flows so that you do the poses slowly and then put them together into a nice flow.**The timing of the postures.  Sure there are some tough poses, can we say ""twisting half moon?""  You hold them long enough to be challenged but not so long that you are dying and wondering when you can stop.**Travis' excellent verbal cuing.  I knew exactly what to do by listening to him and I didn't have to look up at the screen to see what to do.  Note:  If you are beginner yogi, this may not be possible for you since you may not be familiar with all the poses.**Lessening my view of ""all or nothing.""  I didn't follow the Eating Program exactly, especially when it came to the cleanses.  Call it life (and family) getting in the way.  I still got lots of benefit from this program.  Travis also gently reminds us that yoga is about the journey and not the end result.  So I don't look anything like the class when I'm doing some of the poses.  This doesn't matter because the poses are working for me.**The yogi-style pushups.  Okay, I'll admit it, normally I don't like pushups but I know they do great things for my upper body and my core.  I love how Travis `sneaks' in 5 - 10 of these pushups in almost every workout.  You do enough so that you can get stronger, but not so many that you give up in frustration.**The suitability for all levels.  Intermediate yogis can do this program; people with injuries can do this program.  Advanced yogis can do this program.  It's very versatile.  Travis mentions many modifications, including both easier and harder versions of the poses.**The suitability for all spiritual beliefs.  Travis talks about gratitude, kindness and inner peace.  These are universal truths.There are no negatives for me with this program.  I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to get deeper into their yoga practice and truly transform their life.",5,This can truly change your life,1343001600,"07 23, 2012",2012,3798,"['magic', 'bullet', 'Will', 'become', 'thin', 'beautiful', 'Maybe', 'not', 'will', 'feel', 'wonderful', 'inside', '108', 'day', 'program', 'truly', 'changed', 'life.I', 'am', 'advanced', 'fit', 'exerciser', 'who', 'heavy', 'strength', 'training', 'intense', 'cardio', 'torn', 'hip', 'cartilage', 'had', 'really', 'modify', 'workouts', 'was', 'looking', 'something', 'would', 'help', 'maintain', 'fitness', 'level', 'Ultimate', 'Yogi', 'seemed', 'be', 'just', 'thing', 'Prior', 'did', 'yoga', '1', '2', 'days', 'week', 'followed', '108', 'day', 'program', 'also', 'incorporating', 'moderate', 'weight', 'training', 'cardio', 'also', 'followed', 'Common', 'Sense', 'Eating', 'program.I', 'was', 'little', 'nervous', 'staring', 'program', 'was', 'concerned', 'wrists', 'would', 'bother', 'when', 'did', 'so', 'much', 'yoga', 'Well', '108', 'days', ""'m"", 'happy', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'issues', 'think', 'yoga', 'routine', 'so', 'different', 'do', ""n't"", 'overdo', 'one', 'pose.My', 'results', '**I', 'now', 'weigh', 'what', 'did', 'high', 'school', 'first', 'time', 'high', 'school', 'was', 'long', 'time', 'ago', '**I', 'am', 'so', 'much', 'calmer', 'used', 'be', 'am', 'usually', 'hyper', 'person', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sit', 'still', 'who', 'very', 'impatient', 'Not', 'anymore', 'When', 'wake', 'up', 'totally', 'refreshed', 'good', 'night', 'sleep', 'having', 'deep', 'massage', 'closest', 'can', 'describe', 'how', 'now', 'feel', '**My', 'arms', 'are', 'toned', 'never', 'before', 'are', 'more', 'toned', 'when', 'was', 'doing', 'heavy', 'weights', 'body', 'weight', 'work', 'yoga', 'really', 'one', 'body', 'unique', 'will', 'react', 'differently', 'various', 'types', 'training', 'Well', 'body', 'weight', 'work', 'yoga', 'what', 'finally', 'gave', 'toned', 'arms', 'can', 'actually', 'see', 'shoulder', 'triceps', 'muscles', 'now.Why', 'so', 'love', 'program', '**The', 'yoga', 'respectfully', 'disagree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'who', 'thought', 'program', 'was', 'too', 'repetitive', 'felt', 'routine', 'was', 'different', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'bored', 'especially', 'loved', 'how', 'Travis', 'flows', 'do', 'poses', 'slowly', 'then', 'put', 'together', 'nice', 'flow', '**The', 'timing', 'postures', 'Sure', 'are', 'tough', 'poses', 'can', 'say', 'twisting', 'half', 'moon', 'hold', 'long', 'enough', 'be', 'challenged', 'not', 'so', 'long', 'are', 'dying', 'wondering', 'when', 'can', 'stop', '**Travis', 'excellent', 'verbal', 'cuing', 'knew', 'exactly', 'what', 'do', 'listening', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'look', 'up', 'screen', 'see', 'what', 'do', 'Note', 'are', 'beginner', 'yogi', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'possible', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'familiar', 'poses', '**Lessening', 'view', 'nothing', 'did', ""n't"", 'follow', 'Eating', 'Program', 'exactly', 'especially', 'when', 'came', 'cleanses', 'Call', 'life', 'family', 'getting', 'way', 'still', 'got', 'lots', 'benefit', 'program', 'Travis', 'also', 'gently', 'yoga', 'journey', 'not', 'end', 'result', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'anything', 'class', 'when', ""'m"", 'doing', 'poses', ""n't"", 'matter', 'poses', 'are', 'working', '**The', 'yogi-style', 'pushups', 'Okay', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'normally', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'pushups', 'know', 'do', 'great', 'things', 'upper', 'body', 'core', 'love', 'how', 'Travis', 'sneaks', '5', '10', 'pushups', 'almost', 'workout', 'do', 'enough', 'so', 'can', 'get', 'stronger', 'not', 'so', 'many', 'give', 'up', 'frustration', '**The', 'suitability', 'levels', 'Intermediate', 'yogis', 'can', 'do', 'program', 'people', 'injuries', 'can', 'do', 'program', 'Advanced', 'yogis', 'can', 'do', 'program', 'very', 'versatile', 'Travis', 'mentions', 'many', 'modifications', 'including', 'easier', 'harder', 'versions', 'poses', '**The', 'suitability', 'spiritual', 'beliefs', 'Travis', 'talks', 'gratitude', 'kindness', 'inner', 'peace', 'are', 'universal', 'are', 'negatives', 'program', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'wanting', 'get', 'deeper', 'yoga', 'practice', 'truly', 'transform', 'life']",The Ultimate Yogi

SO far I have done Cross Train, Balance, Detox, Cardio and the flexibility dvds.  Travis holds the poses for a very long time.  It's a great series.  The only complaint I have for this series is the constant repetition.  Each DVD starts out with a flow sequence that may last twenty to thirty minutes.  After that sequence is over then you will get more variety for the second half hour of each dvd.  The flow sequence feels like it's almost the same on every dvd.  One may get bored doing the same sequence every day.  Each workout is an hour long and sometimes a little over an hour.  So if your someone who does not have a whole lot of time on her hands this set may not be the best bet.  The picture is excellent.  It feels like your watching an actual movie.  He's very good with instructions.  You don't even have to look at the t.v. screen.  Cross Train is a mixture of all the moves on each dvd.  Detox focuses on doing a lot of different yoga twists to detox the body.  I think the balance dvd was one of my favorites.  It was interesting enough.  The moves are not difficult.  Once the sun saluation sequence is over for each dvd you get more of a variety.  Travis has a very soothing voice that makes me feel calm and relaxed.  The postures are held for a long time.  I really feel the burn.  I see changes in my legs, arms and even less belly fat in my abdominal area.  I still would buy this set even if its repetitious.  I still have not done the Yin Yoga, or the Gentle Yoga and there are a few other dvds I have not done yet.  I can't really deduct a star because its repetitious.  There is just only so many postures you can do for yoga anyway.I like the Ultimate Yogi.  SOme other yoga instructors I like also are:Sarah IvanhoeKathryn BudigTara StilesAnother thing I like about the Ultimate Yogi is when you go to buy a yoga dvd, most yoga dvds are made for beginners only.  This is more of an intermediate to advanced workout.  The moves are not to difficult but if your out of shape it may be very hard to do but not impossible.  I'm in shape and had some trouble holding some of the poses. He seems very personal with all of his students.  Even the music is relaxing and nice to listen to.

1535356,A2EYVGXW1H3ZFR,B007OYK32K,Red,"[37, 40]","I have been practicing yoga for at least ten years.  I have never taken a live class and learned yoga from books and DVDs.  Over the past few years I have moved away from Hatha yoga in favor of Ana & Ravi's Kundalini yoga dvds.  I wanted to start a work out program to help keep muscle mass that is often lost due to aging while working on the loss in mobility in my joints due to a hereditary condition. I also had gotten away from my personal meditation practice while I was doing the Ana & Ravi's workouts since they have meditation built in along with some pranayama but I wanted a longer practice with less focus on Sikh mantras.Just when I was about to make my hair fall out trying to figure out how to do all of these things while still work for a living in walked (or downward dogged) Travis Eliot into my life with a P90X style Yoga program.  I could not purchase the program fast enough once I found it.  As soon as I got the dvd's, I downloaded them to my computer and then to my ipod and started my first of the 108 days that evening.  I have now finished my first 36 days and I have started the second cycle of 36 days so I have now done all of the dvds. Travis Eliot is an excellent teacher and seems like an all round great guy.  His cueing is so good I was able to do all the dvd's by ipod alone and only once or twice did I have to stop what I was doing and pull the ipod out of my armband and look at the video.Travis teaches mainly in Santa Monica and he reminds me of my previously favorite Santa Monica yogi, Bryan Kest.  Travis calls his yoga classes in rhymes like Kest in a sing-song voice which is what I think people are picking up on when they mention in reviews about his voice.  This speech pattern seems to me a Santa Monica or California thing and you get used to it fast.  Also like Kest, Travis TALKS A LOT during his class and if I was going to deduct any points it would be for the fact that they do not have the option to play the class with music and cues only like they on P90X.  After having done the majority of the dvds over 5 times some of the chatter is starting to get a little old and I think if they do a second edition or an Ultimate Yogi 2 that they should drop the option to do the workout without music and instead add option to do it with music and cueing because that would add a lot to repeatability of the program.  However, I not take a point off because the program earned points in so many other areas that to do so just seemed petty.In closing, if you like Hatha yoga and enjoy the California style Power Yoga classes you will LOVE this series.  Although I personally prefer my yoga with all the religion intact, I do enjoy Travis' Unitarian approach and agree with other reviewers that there is NOTHING in these classes that anyone from any religious (or non-religion) background would find offensive. Travis is a little more spiritual or introspective than Bob Harper or Tony Horton but his primary focus is on being in the moment, staying in tune with your body and living life with gratitude which are things I thing 95% of people should not find hokey.Sidebar on each DVD:CROSS TRAINING - easiest of the non yin classes and one of my favorites in the programCARDIO - second hardest with the highest dread factor being the cycle of 10STRENGTH - third hardest with LOTS of arm balances but not as hard on wrists as I fearedFLEXIBILITY - a beast but in a good way - has moves I have never done which makes me love this class but I know it will have a pretty high dread factor for the non gumby typesBALANCE - Travis states in the dvd that he bets we never want to put this dvd back in the player again after doing the class once and he is right - Hardest of all classes but where would be the challenge if there was not at least one dvd that might actually take 15 times to actually be able to do it without stumbling a few times;DETOX - lots of twists which I thought I would not like but it is actually my second favorite and like cross training is one of the lighter days while still being yangVITALITY - my favorite class which surprised me since I am not really big into backbendsHARDCORE - doable but with plenty of with room to grow and not nearly as high a dread factor as I feared and enough variety that I have not gotten bored with it even after doing it over 15 timesGENTLE YOGA - I have only done this once in the program so far and did not like it as much as I hoped but it will probably grow on meYIN YOGA - would have been my favorite if Travis did not talk so much - this is another that will be real hard for non flexible people especially since you hold a couple of the poses for over 5 minutesMOUNTAIN POSE SERIES - closest thing to a misstep to me first time I did it but after the 6th time it is starting to grow on me but do I wish it was little more Qi Gong and in fact I have on occasion substituted a Qi Gong dvd for this onePRANAYAMA MEDITATION - wish he would count a little quieter because it takes me out of the meditation but other than that I am happy with this one.",5,Making me fall in love with Hatha Yoga again,1354838400,"12 7, 2012",2012,5058,"['have', 'been', 'practicing', 'yoga', 'least', 'ten', 'years', 'have', 'never', 'taken',

I have very little experience of doing yoga but was very curious when I read about  this system on video fitness and I checked out the Ultimate Yogi website. I really liked how the website was laid out and how I was able to see short clips of the workouts. I was sold and was very excited to start this yoga program.  The program lasts for 108 days and most of the workouts last a little over an hour. The workouts are very varied, challenging but at the same time enjoyable and energising. The music on each DVD really is wonderful and Travis is an incredible teacher, he is excellent at cueing each of the yoga moves and shows modifications for the beginner and the advanced yogi.Previously I would only have done hIgh intensity cardio workouts and lifted heavy weights so this ultimate yogi is a complete change for me but my body is responding so well. I'm still staying in great shape and I feel this yoga is giving me a glow.

I enjoy the workouts in this series due to opportunity to get a good fitness workout but I think the workouts are extreme, especially when instructed to repeat the same flow up to 4 or 5 times and often too quickly (esp. the Cardio workout).Referring to P90X and yoga together is an oxymoron, such a contradiction.  The fact that this is being referred to as the P90X of yoga really makes me question what yoga has become in this country.  I do enjoy the difficulty of the power yoga workouts but I feel it's missing the mark of what yoga is supposed to be.I am in very good physical condition but the thought of doing these workouts everyday is absurd.  The workouts are long, most are an hour.  The workouts push your body to its limits.  I personally need at least a day between these workouts for my body to repair and heal.  This may be because I am in my early 40's.  The average person who does regular yoga is likely not going to be able to buy this series and jump right into these workouts as prescribed.I like Eliot's instruction.  He is clear and it's easy to do the moves without looking at the screen.  He provides some instruction for proper executive for someone who is very familiar with yoga.The series can be used however you chose and at your own pace.  The set is reasonably priced considering you get a myriad of different DVDs in which to choose.OVerall, a good addition to your yoga DVD library.",4,"Quite strenuous, proceed with extreme caution",1375574400,"08 4, 2013",2013,1802,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'yoga', '3', 'years', 'studios', 'videos', 'including', 'Kest', 'Blanchard', ""'m"", 'very', 'strong', 'years', 'weight', 'lifting', 'made', 'Ultimate', 'Yogi', 'series', 'easy', 'working', 'Cross', 'Training', 'Cardio', 'Strength', 'Flexibility', 'Detox', 'videos', ""'ve"", 'suffered', 'throbbing', 'headaches', 'neck', 'pain', 'red', 'flag', 'workouts', 'are', 'strenuous', 'enjoy', 'workouts', 'series', 'due', 'opportunity', 'get', 'good', 'fitness', 'think', 'workouts', 'are', 'extreme', 'especially', 'when', 'instructed', 'repeat', 'same', 'flow', 'up', '4', '5', 'times', 'often', 'too', 'quickly', 'esp', 'Cardio', 'workout', '.Referring', 'P90X', 'yoga', 'together', 'oxymoron', 'contradiction', 'fact', 'being', 'referred', 'P90X', 'yoga', 'really', 'question', 'what', 'yoga', 'become', 'country', 'do', 'enjoy', 'difficulty', 'power', 'yoga', 'workouts', 'feel', 'missing', 'mark', 'what', 'yoga', 'supposed', 'be.I', 'am', 'very', 'good', 'physical', 'condition', 'thought', 'doing', 'workouts', 'everyday', 'absurd', 'workouts', 'are', 'long', 'most', 'are', 'hour', 'workouts', 'push', 'body', 'limits', 'personally', 'need', 'least', 'day', 'workouts', 'body', 'repair', 'heal', 'may', 'be', 'am', 'early', '40', 'average', 'person', 'who', 'regular', 'yoga', 'likely', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'able', 'buy', 'series', 'jump', 'right', 'workouts', 'prescribed.I', 'Eliot', 'instruction', 'clear', 'easy', 'do', 'moves', 'looking', 'screen', 'instruction', 'proper', 'executive', 'someone', 'who', 'very', 'familiar', 'yoga.The', 'series', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'however', 'chose', 'own', 'pace', 'set', 'reasonably', 'priced', 'considering', 'get', 'myriad', 'different', 'DVDs', 'choose.OVerall', 'good', 'addition', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'library']",The Ultimate Yogi
