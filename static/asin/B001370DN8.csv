Parkinson ""Film & Book VIP""","[9, 16]","What I liked most about the Stephen King movie / mini-series ""IT"" was the freaky clown that kept showing up (only later to morph into a spider in one of cinema's most bizarre ""what the heck?"" moments!!).  The spider was dumb, but the freaky clown, now that was scary.  I mean, aren't all clowns rather freaky and creepy to begin with?  So along comes THE FUN PARK, based on the popular urban-legend of a haunted amusement park in rural Oklahoma.  If you don't know the story, basically, Bobo killed some folks way back when, and still haunts the abandoned site, waiting for the next batch of brave teens to try and debunk the legend.  In THE FUN PARK, only one survives, but that's more than usual for Bobo.  Overall, the film is well paced and well directed.  Some of the acting is marginal, but certainly not with key roles by teen-movie veterans Randy Wayne and Jillian Murray.  I appreciated that the gore was implied or kept to a minimum, which probably helped the filmmakers get a broader audience and DVD placement, without compromising any of the scares and thrills.",5,"Probably the best ""scary clown"" movie of all time!!",1202083200,"02 4, 2008",2008,1074,"['What', 'liked', 'most', 'Stephen', 'King', 'movie', '/', 'mini-series', 'IT', 'was', 'freaky', 'clown', 'kept', 'showing', 'up', 'only', 'later', 'morph', 'spider', 'one', 'cinema', 'most', 'bizarre', 'what', 'heck', 'spider', 'was', 'dumb', 'freaky', 'clown', 'now', 'was', 'scary', 'mean', 'are', ""n't"", 'all', 'clowns', 'rather', 'freaky', 'creepy', 'begin', 'So', 'along', 'THE', 'FUN', 'PARK', 'based', 'popular', 'urban-legend', 'haunted', 'amusement', 'park', 'rural', 'Oklahoma', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'story', 'basically', 'Bobo', 'killed', 'folks', 'way', 'back', 'when', 'still', 'abandoned', 'site', 'waiting', 'next', 'batch', 'brave', 'teens', 'try', 'debunk', 'legend', 'THE', 'FUN', 'PARK', 'only', 'one', 'more', 'usual', 'Bobo', 'Overall', 'film', 'well', 'paced', 'well', 'directed', 'acting', 'marginal', 'certainly', 'not', 'key', 'roles', 'teen-movie', 'veterans', 'Randy', 'Wayne', 'Jillian', 'Murray', 'appreciated', 'gore', 'was', 'implied', 'kept', 'minimum', 'probably', 'helped', 'filmmakers', 'get', 'broader', 'audience', 'DVD', 'placement', 'compromising', 'scares', 'thrills']",The Fun Park
1140393,A3FUBUJAIGM87T,B001370DN8,"HorrorMan ""HM""","[9, 11]","The makers of ""The Fun Park"" tried to do something a little bit different with this flick.  What appears to be a slasher flick with a carnival and clown theme is really anything but the kind.  ""The Fun Park"" is about the mystery surrounding a clown who was supposedly beaten to death some years ago at a fun park.  When some stupid teenagers go to ""The Fun Park"" for some action, they get more than they bargained for.  This seems to be a pretty good plot, but the makers of ""The Fun Park"" tried to be different in how they related the story to the audience.  What transpires in ""The Fun Park"" is a backwards and disjointed effort at mixing past and present events that results in an awkward and tedious movie that reflects poor design and effort on the makers of this flick.Ultimately, ""The Fun Park"" is one of the most bungled, disorganized and pointless films I have ever seen.  There is no theatrical structure to this movie whatsoever, and the movie lacks suspense as a consequence.  There is very little in the way of scares in this movie, and although I tried very hard to like it, I could not get over the way in which this movie unfolded.  Clearly, the movie would have been better if the story was communicated to the audience in a different way.  Anticlimactic would be a good way to describe ""The Fun Park"" except for the fact that there never was any rising action or climax to begin with.  Also, the acting in ""The Fun Park"" is clearly below average which only accentuates the poor execution associated with this movie.  While ""The Fun Park"" attempts to be different, the movie trips over itself at every turn and the result is a prime example of cinematic incompetence that frustrates the viewer.  Basically, ""The Fun Park"" never gets off the ground because of these inherently fatal flaws.I think clowns can be scary, but this movie fails in its essential purpose.  ""The Fun Park"" is not scary at all.  In fact, it sucks.  If you want to see a good scary movie about a fun park, I recommend ""The Funhouse"" instead which is a structurally sound horror movie that utilizes the fun park setting to perfection creating suspense and plenty of scares along the way.  Hell, even ""Clownhouse"" is miles ahead of ""The Fun Park"".  Unfortunately, I cannot recommend ""The Fun Park"" to anyone.",1,"0.25 STARS: Different, but pointless.",1207699200,"04 9, 2008",2008,2295,"['makers', 'Fun', 'Park', 'tried', 'do', 'something', 'little', 'bit', 'different', 'flick', 'What', 'be', 'slasher', 'flick', 'carnival', 'clown', 'theme', 'really', 'anything', 'kind', 'Fun', 'Park', 'mystery', 'surrounding', 'clown', 'who', 'was', 'supposedly', 'beaten', 'death', 'years', 'ago', 'fun', 'park', 'When', 'stupid', 'teenagers', 'go', 'Fun', 'Park', 'action', 'get', 'more', 'bargained', 'be', 'pretty', 'good', 'plot', 'makers', 'Fun', 'Park', 'tried', 'be', 'different', 'how', 'related', 'story', 'audience', 'What', 'Fun', 'Park', 'backwards', 'disjointed', 'effort', 'mixing', 'past', 'present', 'events', 'results', 'awkward', 'tedious', 'movie', 'poor', 'design', 'effort', 'makers', 'flick.Ultimately', 'Fun', 'Park', 'one', 'most', 'bungled', 'disorganized', 'pointless', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'theatrical', 'structure', 'movie', 'whatsoever', 'movie', 'suspense', 'consequence', 'very', 'little', 'way', 'scares', 'movie', 'tried', 'very', 'hard', 'like', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'way', 'movie', 'unfolded', 'Clearly', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'story', 'was', 'communicated', 'audience', 'different', 'way', 'Anticlimactic', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'way', 'describe', 'Fun', 'Park', 'fact', 'never', 'was', 'rising', 'action', 'climax', 'begin', 'Also', 'acting', 'Fun', 'Park', 'clearly', 'below', 'average', 'only', 'poor', 'execution', 'associated', 'movie', 'Fun', 'Park', 'attempts', 'be', 'different', 'movie', 'turn', 'result', 'prime', 'example', 'cinematic', 'incompetence', 'viewer', 'Basically', 'Fun', 'Park', 'never', 'ground', 'inherently', 'fatal', 'flaws.I', 'think', 'clowns', 'can', 'be', 'scary', 'movie', 'essential', 'purpose', 'Fun', 'Park', 'not', 'scary', 'fact', 'want', 'see', 'good', 'scary', 'movie', 'fun', 'park', 'recommend', 'Funhouse', 'instead', 'structurally', 'sound', 'horror', 'movie', 'fun', 'park', 'setting', 'perfection', 'creating', 'suspense', 'plenty', 'scares', 'way', 'Hell', 'even', 'Clownhouse', 'miles', 'ahead', 'Fun', 'Park', 'Unfortunately', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'Fun', 'Park', 'anyone']",The Fun Park

Most of the middle of the movie when all the action is supposed to be happening- it just loses the interest of the viewer big time.  It's the same stuff over and over again and there is NO suspense.  The acting is pretty bad too. I started to fast forward through parts of this movie because it just went on and on but not in a good way.

One thing that I like to do is look at B movies and see how well they could do with what they had to work with. This movie failed in almost every way.1. Corny dialogue;2. Bad acting;3.

1140396,A1B3XL8MXYC6ND,B001370DN8,"Pugmom ""lover of dogs, books and horror movies""","[4, 6]","I'm a sucker for any movie that features amusement parks, especially spooky abandoned ones, and clowns. This movie has a good concept, but just can't pull it off.The plot is not new, but is still interesting: a group of teens decide to check out the abandoned amusement park in their hometown, which happened to be the site of a brutal murder 20 years ago. Like most teenagers in movies today, their exploits are captured on video, making this a sort of Blair Witch hunt in the amusement park. Not surprisingly, they meet up with the baddie, a psycho clown, who then- gasp- kills them all but one girl. The survivor then works with her shrink and the police to piece together what really happened at the park. One thing is for sure, if I disappeared, I wouldn't want this police force looking for me.This all sounds dandy, but is marred through bad lighting, bad acting/ dialogue, and a general ho-hum approach. The story utilizes a lot of flashbacks, which doesn't really work in this film and instead leaves you going ""What?""If you're looking for killer clowns, or spooky amusement parks- or just about any kind of movie, for that matter- you could do better than this one.",2,Nothing fun here,1206921600,"03 31, 2008",2008,1175,"[""'m"", 'sucker', 'movie', 'amusement', 'parks', 'especially', 'spooky', 'abandoned', 'ones', 'clowns', 'movie', 'good', 'concept', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pull', 'off.The', 'plot', 'not', 'new', 'still', 'interesting', 'group', 'teens', 'decide', 'check', 'out', 'abandoned', 'amusement', 'park', 'hometown', 'happened', 'be', 'site', 'brutal', 'murder', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'most', 'teenagers', 'movies', 'today', 'exploits', 'are', 'captured', 'video', 'making', 'sort', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'hunt', 'amusement', 'park', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'meet', 'up', 'baddie', 'psycho', 'clown', 'who', 'then-', 'gasp-', 'kills', 'one', 'girl', 'survivor', 'then', 'shrink', 'police', 'piece', 'together', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'park', 'One', 'thing', 'sure', 'disappeared', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'police', 'force', 'looking', 'me.This', 'dandy', 'marred', 'bad', 'lighting', 'bad', 'acting/', 'dialogue', 'general', 'ho-hum', 'approach', 'story', 'lot', 'flashbacks', ""n't"", 'really', 'work', 'film', 'instead', 'going', 'What', ""'re"", 'looking', 'killer', 'clowns', 'spooky', 'amusement', 'parks-', 'just', 'kind', 'movie', 'matter-', 'could', 'do', 'better', 'one']",The Fun Park

What could be more fun than watching some teens get chased through an amusement park by a psychopathic killer clown right?!  Well...I wouldn't be able to tell ya cuz this film didn't deliver in that aspect.  It was done in more of a memory sequence, not cool!!  It did not keep my attention, it was pretty much a snoozer.  There were a couple parts that I can recall that were a little squeamish, but other than that, nothing really stood out.  At least it wasn't homemade with a camcorder and 1,000, that's one good thing.  I'd have to say, skip this one......unless of course you LOVE clown movies and collect them.
