Considering I dont think I only saw the film once on tv and ten or more years ago, it stuck with me. Anyways, you can read the synposis of the movie. The acting is bad, the movie is slow paced, and just plain sucked. I wouldnt recommend anyone watch it.",1,Final Draft,1299110400,"03 3, 2011",2011,366,"['never', 'liked', 'James', 'Van', 'Der', 'Beek', 'dont', 'know', 'why', 'think', 'was', 'was', 'bully', 'film', 'Angus', 'Considering', 'dont', 'think', 'only', 'saw', 'film', 'once', 'tv', 'ten', 'more', 'years', 'ago', 'stuck', 'Anyways', 'can', 'read', 'synposis', 'movie', 'acting', 'bad', 'movie', 'slow', 'paced', 'just', 'plain', 'sucked', 'wouldnt', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'watch']",Final Draft
1079985,ASHBFCUZAYCS4,B000R7HY2S,"Lord Schitsdain ""The sage of rage""","[0, 0]","This movie was surprisingly dull. I kept waiting for something to happen, and it just never got up a good head of steam. I was going to say that it was overly long and could have used some more editing, but I see above that they list the running time as 90 min. I swear it felt like closer to 3 hours. It dragged and dragged. There were random scenes of weirdness, but it never launches itself into any sort of supernatural horror mode. Barely even qualifies as pschological drama. The jump edits and scene transitions were very jarring, I suppose to mimic the characters tenuous grasp on reality, but it just felt like poor editing. I know they were trying to do something different, a clown hitting people over the head with a bag of oranges and staging their deaths to look like suicide, but they should have worried more about making it interesting, not just different. The clown is a complete non entity. He's there, but only as interesting as a department store maniquin. I only give this an extra star because James Van Der Beek at least gives the material the old college try, there just isn't much to work with. This fell so flat it should probably only get one star, but I'll be kind.",2,I never knew clowns could be so boring,1282780800,"08 26, 2010",2010,1194,"['movie', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'dull', 'kept', 'waiting', 'something', 'happen', 'just', 'never', 'got', 'up', 'good', 'head', 'steam', 'was', 'going', 'say', 'was', 'overly', 'long', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'more', 'editing', 'see', 'list', 'running', 'time', '90', 'min', 'swear', 'felt', 'closer', '3', 'hours', 'dragged', 'dragged', 'were', 'random', 'scenes', 'weirdness', 'never', 'sort', 'supernatural', 'horror', 'mode', 'Barely', 'even', 'qualifies', 'pschological', 'drama', 'jump', 'edits', 'scene', 'transitions', 'were', 'very', 'jarring', 'suppose', 'mimic', 'characters', 'tenuous', 'grasp', 'reality', 'just', 'felt', 'like', 'poor', 'editing', 'know', 'were', 'trying', 'do', 'something', 'different', 'clown', 'hitting', 'people', 'head', 'bag', 'oranges', 'staging', 'deaths', 'look', 'suicide', 'should', 'have', 'worried', 'more', 'making', 'interesting', 'not', 'just', 'different', 'clown', 'complete', 'non', 'entity', 'there', 'only', 'as', 'interesting', 'department', 'store', 'maniquin', 'only', 'give', 'extra', 'star', 'James', 'Van', 'Der', 'Beek', 'least', 'material', 'old', 'college', 'try', 'just', ""n't"", 'much', 'work', 'fell', 'so', 'flat', 'should', 'probably', 'only', 'get', 'one', 'star', ""'ll"", 'be', 'kind']",Final Draft

The script, written by costar Darryn Lucio, is so contrived and poorly conceived that Van Der Beek never stood a chance.  He plays a screenwriter with severe psychological baggage and writer's block who locks himself in his apartment to focus on his latest screenplay, which involves a killer clown and revenge, and suicide, to boot.  The problem is the movie's pace is slow with redundant fadeouts and lots of silence, and never really grabs you with any kind of emotional value.  Van Der Beek tries hard but he's not given much to work with.  And Lucio's script is laced with an abundance of profanities which goes to show that mediocre screenwriters think a thousand F***s are so ""realistic"" wherein they only represent the writer's inability to create real situations and dialogues without throwing in a F*** in every other line.  A real loser, not even worth a rental folks.",1,DAWSONS CREEP,1191715200,"10 7, 2007",2007,1073,"['having', 'just', 'seen', 'John', 'Cusack', 'virtual', 'one', 'man', 'show', 'brilliant', 'one', '1408', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'feel', 'sorry', 'James', 'Van', 'Der', 'Beek', 'one', 'man', 'show', 'sorely', 'incomparable', 'script', 'written', 'costar', 'Darryn', 'Lucio', 'so', 'contrived', 'poorly', 'conceived', 'Van', 'Der', 'Beek', 'never', 'stood', 'chance', 'screenwriter', 'severe', 'psychological', 'baggage', 'writer', 'block', 'who', 'apartment', 'focus', 'latest', 'screenplay', 'killer', 'clown', 'revenge', 'suicide', 'boot', 'problem', 'movie', 'pace', 'slow', 'redundant', 'fadeouts', 'lots', 'silence', 'never', 'really', 'grabs', 'kind', 'emotional', 'value', 'Van', 'Der', 'Beek', 'hard', 'not', 'given', 'much', 'work', 'Lucio', 'script', 'laced', 'abundance', 'profanities', 'show', 'mediocre', 'screenwriters', 'think', 'thousand', 'F***s', 'are', 'so', 'realistic', 'wherein', 'only', 'represent', 'writer', 'inability', 'create', 'real', 'situations', 'dialogues', 'throwing', 'F***', 'other', 'line', 'real', 'loser', 'not', 'even', 'rental', 'folks']",Final Draft
1079987,A1DTNYGTWIN4DS,B000R7HY2S,NateMonroe,"[0, 0]","It was time to kill the clown before this dismal production was even made. Van Der Beek did an excellent job portraying the troubled Paul, but the story, editing, and directing was just plain awful. Only his character was appealing, the rest were so self absorbed or just plain nasty that they actually came off as irritating.The editing is choppy, although purposely done to help imply Paul's insanity, but it actually made the movie confusing. A scene would start, then it would jump back a few seconds and overlap and by the time the scene was done you really had no idea if it was important to the plot or not.Just plain depressing and dull. But I still like James Van Der Beek.",1,James Van Der Beek is top notch...but,1277078400,"06 21, 2010",2010,682,"['was', 'time', 'kill', 'clown', 'dismal', 'production', 'was', 'even', 'made', 'Van', 'Der', 'Beek', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'troubled', 'Paul', 'story', 'editing', 'directing', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'awful', 'Only', 'character', 'was', 'appealing', 'rest', 'were', 'so', 'self', 'absorbed', 'just', 'plain', 'nasty', 'actually', 'came', 'off', 'irritating.The', 'editing', 'choppy', 'purposely', 'done', 'help', 'imply', 'Paul', 'insanity', 'actually', 'made', 'movie', 'confusing', 'scene', 'would', 'start', 'then', 'would', 'jump', 'back', 'few', 'seconds', 'overlap', 'time', 'scene', 'was', 'done', 'really', 'had', 'idea', 'was', 'important', 'plot', 'not.Just', 'plain', 'depressing', 'dull', 'still', 'James', 'Van', 'Der', 'Beek']",Final Draft
1079988,AGDD9T5BOHAOA,B000R7HY2S,"Ruggero Deodato ""Where Has HORROR GONE""","[2, 3]","THIS IS A VERY SHARP AND INTERESTING FILM. THIS IS ABOUT A YOUNG WRITER PAUL TWIST PLAYED BY JAMES VAN DER BEEK. HE HAS TO WRITE A HORROR MOVIE IN 18 DAYS. HE LOCKS HIMSELF IN HIS LOFT AND BEGINS. THE HORROR IS HE IS HAUNTED BY HIS PAST. A DARK CLOWN, A MENACE A NIGHTMARE FROM HIS CHILDHOOD. HIS EX- WIFE, HIS BROTHER AND HIS OWN DARK DEEP SECRETS.I THINK WHAT STANDS OUT IN THIS MOVIE IS THE ACTING AND THE WONDERFUL MIND TRIP OF A PLOT. YOU SEE THE REALITY OF MAN TURN UPSIDE DOWN AND TWIST INTO A WORLD THAT HE SEEMS TO IMAGINE YET CAN NOT CONTROL.AS HE WRITES HE SEES THE PEOPLE IN HIS LIFE WHO HAVE CAUSED HIM PROBLEMS THERE WITH HIM IN THE LOFT. HIS MIND STARTS TO UNRAVEL , HIS THOUGHTS BECOME CLOUDED BY IMAGES OF VIOLENCE AND INSANITY.I WAS VERY WELL PLEASED WITH THIS MOVIE IT WORKED IN SO MANY WAYS. I LOVE THE ONE ACT FEEL TO THE MOVIE. THE END WHEN HE IS LOCKED INSIDE THE LOFT WORKS THE MOVIE WITH BEAUTY AND A TWISTED SENSE OF HORROR WHICH IS INSANITY ITSELF.THE STORY BECOMES APART OF HIM AS HE ACTS OUT THE HORROR THAT HIS MIND HAS CREATED. THE DEPRESSION OF HIS LIFE, THE FEEL OF FAILURE BECAUSE OF WRITERS BLOCK. THIS MOVIE IS NOT ABOUT GORE OR MASSIVE BLOOD, IT'S THE MIND AND THE AFFECTS OF HOW FAR THE INNER THOUGHTS CAN BECOME REALITY, HOW EACH ONE IS MIXED INTO THE PUDDLE OF DARKNESS AND HOW THAT DARKNESS CAN TAKE OVER.I REALLY SEE NO FAULTS WITH THIS MOVIE ACCEPT SOME SLOW SPOTS AT TIMES BUT THE FILM COMES TOGETHER IN THE END AS A WELL PLAYED OUT ONE ACT WITH MORE TO IT. IT SHOCKS ME FROM ALL THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS I HAVE READ ABOUT THIS AND I WONDER WHY PEOPLE WHERE SO NEGATIVE I THOUGHT THE MOVIE CAPTURED INSANITY TO THE POINT AND MADE THE VIEWER TAKE THAT TRIP ALSO.",3,I ENJOYED,1216598400,"07 21, 2008",2008,1701,"['THIS', 'VERY', 'SHARP', 'AND', 'INTERESTING', 'FILM', 'THIS', 'A', 'YOUNG', 'WRITER', 'PAUL', 'TWIST', 'PLAYED', 'BY', 'JAMES', 'VAN', 'DER', 'BEEK', 'HE', 'TO', 'WRITE', 'A', 'HORROR', 'MOVIE', 'IN', '18', 'DAYS', 'HE', 'LOCKS', 'HIMSELF', 'IN', 'HIS', 'LOFT', 'AND', 'BEGINS', 'THE', 'HORROR', 'IS', 'HE', 'IS', 'HAUNTED', 'BY', 'HIS', 'PAST', 'A', 'DARK', 'CLOWN', 'A', 'MENACE', 'A', 'NIGHTMARE', 'FROM', 'HIS', 'CHILDHOOD', 'HIS', 'EX-', 'WIFE', 'HIS', 'BROTHER', 'AND', 'HIS', 'OWN', 'DARK', 'DEEP', 'SECRETS.I', 'THINK', 'WHAT', 'OUT', 'IN', 'THIS', 'MOVIE', 'THE', 'ACTING', 'AND', 'THE', 'WONDERFUL', 'MIND', 'TRIP', 'A', 'PLOT', 'YOU', 'SEE', 'REALITY', 'OF', 'MAN', 'TURN', 'UPSIDE', 'DOWN', 'AND', 'TWIST', 'INTO', 'A', 'WORLD', 'HE', 'SEEMS', 'TO', 'IMAGINE', 'YET', 'CAN', 'NOT', 'CONTROL.AS', 'HE', 'HE', 'SEES', 'THE', 'PEOPLE', 'IN', 'HIS', 'LIFE', 'WHO', 'HAVE', 'CAUSED', 'HIM', 'PROBLEMS', 'THERE', 'WITH', 'HIM', 'IN', 'THE', 'LOFT', 'HIS', 'MIND', 'STARTS', 'TO', 'UNRAVEL', 'HIS', 'THOUGHTS', 'BECOME', 'CLOUDED', 'BY', 'IMAGES', 'OF', 'VIOLENCE', 'AND', 'INSANITY.I', 'WAS', 'VERY', 'WELL', 'PLEASED', 'WITH', 'THIS', 'MOVIE', 'IT', 'WORKED', 'IN', 'SO', 'MANY', 'WAYS', 'LOVE', 'ONE', 'ACT', 'FEEL', 'TO', 'THE', 'MOVIE', 'THE', 'END', 'WHEN', 'HE', 'IS', 'LOCKED', 'INSIDE', 'THE', 'LOFT', 'WORKS', 'THE', 'MOVIE', 'WITH', 'BEAUTY', 'A', 'TWISTED', 'SENSE', 'OF', 'HORROR', 'WHICH', 'IS', 'INSANITY', 'ITSELF.THE', 'STORY', 'BECOMES', 'APART', 'OF', 'HIM', 'HE', 'ACTS', 'OUT', 'THE', 'HORROR', 'THAT', 'HIS', 'MIND', 'HAS', 'CREATED', 'DEPRESSION', 'HIS', 'LIFE', 'THE', 'FEEL', 'FAILURE', 'BECAUSE', 'OF', 'WRITERS', 'BLOCK', 'THIS', 'MOVIE', 'NOT', 'ABOUT', 'GORE', 'OR', 'MASSIVE', 'BLOOD', 'IT', 'THE', 'MIND', 'AND', 'THE', 'AFFECTS', 'OF', 'HOW', 'FAR', 'THE', 'INNER', 'THOUGHTS', 'CAN', 'BECOME', 'REALITY', 'HOW', 'EACH', 'ONE', 'IS', 'MIXED', 'INTO', 'THE', 'PUDDLE', 'OF', 'DARKNESS', 'AND', 'HOW', 'THAT', 'DARKNESS', 'CAN', 'TAKE', 'OVER.I', 'REALLY', 'SEE', 'NO', 'FAULTS', 'WITH', 'THIS', 'MOVIE', 'ACCEPT', 'SOME', 'SLOW', 'SPOTS', 'AT', 'TIMES', 'BUT', 'THE', 'FILM', 'COMES', 'TOGETHER', 'IN', 'THE', 'END', 'A', 'WELL', 'PLAYED', 'OUT', 'ONE', 'ACT', 'WITH', 'MORE', 'TO', 'IT', 'IT', 'SHOCKS', 'ME', 'FROM', 'ALL', 'THE', 'NEGATIVE', 'REVIEWS', 'HAVE', 'READ', 'THIS', 'WONDER', 'WHY', 'PEOPLE', 'WHERE', 'SO', 'NEGATIVE', 'THOUGHT', 'MOVIE', 'CAPTURED', 'INSANITY', 'TO', 'THE', 'POINT', 'AND', 'MADE', 'THE', 'VIEWER', 'TAKE', 'THAT', 'TRIP', 'ALSO']",Final Draft
