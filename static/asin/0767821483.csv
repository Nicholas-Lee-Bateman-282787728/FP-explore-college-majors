15929,A35XMSURGM0L1N,0767821483,,"[0, 0]","Considered a landmark film, it addresses racial prejudice and interracial marriage in a time when sixteen states in America still upheld laws that made miscegenation a crime. It is important to pay attention to past racial and ethnic issues, in order to understand those today and to see whether any `progress' towards a more `tolerant' society has been made. Guess Who's Coming to Dinner is an entertaining, straightforward and well-meant film that will hopefully make students aware of the controversy of interracial relationships throughout the decades and centuries even. Being a child of mixed race parents, I find the film meaningful in showing two people of different races, being very much in love and very willing to face all the social obstacles their interracial relationship is bound to encounter.SummaryIn Guess Who's Coming to Dinner the 23-year-old, white, upper class Joanna ""Joey"" Drayton (Katharine Houghton) brings home her fianc&eacute; John Wade Prentice (Sidney Poitier) to meet her parents. When he turns out to be a distinguished 37-year-old black doctor, the ""liberal"" progressive parents (Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy) are forced to re-examine their beliefs regarding interracial marriage and are given one single day to do so. Before the parents can get all of their objections sorted out, they have John's parents coming to dinner as well. Both sets of parents have reservations about this union, but try to come to terms with the interracial marriage.DiscussionGuess Who's Coming To Dinner? raises several questions or issues that might be interesting to discuss after viewing it. The film's main themes are interracial relationships and prejudice, and it advocates a mixed race marriage, which makes it a very progressive movie for the 1960s. Considered progressive as well are Joey's `liberal' parents who have raised their daughter not to be prejudiced and they have done this successfully, with her `lack of' prejudice extending to her being able to fall in love with an African American. The parents are then left to consider whether they really believe in their acclaimed `liberal thinking' and this may raise important questions with the viewing audience. Are human beings really as liberal or conservative as they think they are when it comes to practicing what they preach?If it is not race that prevents the parents (the fathers in particular), both Joanna's and John's, from approving the marriage, what is?The only objection to the interracial marriage vocalized in the film is the harsh treatment they will most likely receive from society. Although this is a valid and probably accurate objection, it is debatable on whether the fathers do not have more personal objections. The movie glosses over the subject of interracial marriage without getting too detailed, but the concern on whether the couple understands the adversity they will face if they go ahead with their interracial marriage is very clear.The themes addressed in the film were still much of a taboo in the 1960s, so in order to merely create a `mild controversy', the director seems to have made the relationship between John and Joey as `acceptable' as possible. Infallible and with impeccable credentials as a prize-winning doctor and working for the World Health Organization, John is portrayed as an in-laws dream. The character is in every socioeconomic sense a `good catch': What parent would not want him as a son-in-law? But what if the director had made the fianc&eacute; a factory worker? Would the audience still find it as easy to accept a mixed-race relationship?Also, to reduce the seriousness of the racial themes, the film is presented as a comedy. This means that conservative viewers can laugh about it while telling themselves that these events would never really happen. Finally, Joey and John avoid their biggest challenge by intending to live abroad for John's work. Therefore, they will not have to cope with the racial tensions in the country and they will not have to combine two communities and identities or have to pick one over the other.When it was released it 1967, Guess Who`s Coming to Dinner reflected upon the changing race relation in America. Interracial intimacy and marriage in particular were delicate themes to discuss, which makes this film so important, both at that time as well as today. The individual right to choose a sexual partner, select a spouse and raise a family could not be fully exercised in all of the United States up until the Loving decision in 1967, which banned anti-miscegenation laws. Although these laws disappeared, the prejudices that had always accompanied them, could not be banned so easily. They persisted, despite the colour blind ideal.The fact that the Joey's father is an intellectual liberal forced to face his own buried prejudices gives the film an important message that should still be considered today. On some deeply personal level many people are still prejudiced, no matter how hard they try to tell themselves otherwise. In Guess Who's Coming to Dinner Spencer Tracy's character comes to this realization, but is able to put his objections for his daughter's happiness. The film chooses to be colour blind like Joey's father and lets pure and simple love instead of race be the basis for a successful marriage. Or as Matt Drayton argues in his `final analysis' in Guess Who's Coming To Dinner:""[...] in the final analysis it doesn't matter a damn what we think. The only thing that matters is what they feel, and how much they feel for each other. And if it's half of what we felt ... that's everything"".",5,Landmark film about racial prejudice,1083628800,"05 4, 2004",2004,5607,"['Considered', 'landmark', 'film', 'racial', 'prejudice',

This superlative movie tells the poignant and emotional story of how aging parents must confront love between blacks and whites in their times--and in our own times as well.The action begins when Joey Drayton (Katharine Houghton) is bringing home her brand new boyfriend Dr. John Wade Prentice (Sidney Poitier) to meet her parents. And what a shock her parents Matt and Christina Drayton (Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn) are about to have! Joey's fianc&eacute; is African American, older than she--and they intend to marry almost immediately--if Joey's parents Matt and Christina approve of it. Adding to the pile of people and the emotional baggage are John Prentice's parents Mr. and Mrs. Prentice (Roy Glenn and Beah Richards).The shock hits the parents hard. Matt Drayton asks John Prentice's parents to fly to their home in San Francisco from their home in Los Angeles to have a major discussion as to what should be done about the situation. (I suppose these days there wouldn't be such an absolute emotional meltdown by the two fathers; but, then again, knowing some people this still could happen even in our times.)Once John Prentice's parents arrive at the home of Joey's parents Matt and Christina Drayton, there is much to be thought through in very little time. Joey's fianc&eacute; Dr. John Prentice is leaving almost immediately to accept a job offer in Switzerland.Look for some very moving scenes between John Prentice and his father as they passionately discuss race and romance between the races; and Matt Drayton's final speech about their daughter's love for her fianc&eacute; is probably one of the best moments in all of cinematic history. Katherine Hepburn as Christina Drayton turns in an excellent, flawless performance. Look also for Isabel Sanford to make her movie debut as Tillie, the maid in the Drayton's home.The DVD has little extras besides the original theatrical trailer but as of this writing I am hopeful that the 40th Anniversary re-release will correct for that.Overall, Guess Who's Coming To Dinner is a striking, memorable view on race relations that remains very memorable even in our times. The convincing acting is some of the best I've ever seen; and the moral of the story that love conquers all is one I would like to hold dear to me. I highly recommend this movie for aficionados of quality film; you won't be disappointed.Five stars.",5,love really DID conquer all,1198713600,"12 27, 2007",2007,2610,"['Guess', 'Who', 'Coming', 'Dinner', 'may', 'officially', 'be', 'dated', 'unfortunately', 'are', 'still', 'many', 'people', 'nation', 'world', 'who', 'would', 'prefer', 'not', 'date', 'let', 'alone', 'marry', 'someone', 'own', 'race', 'religion', 'superlative', 'movie', 'poignant', 'emotional', 'story', 'how', 'aging', 'parents', 'must', 'confront', 'love', 'blacks', 'whites', 'times', 'own', 'times', 'well.The', 'action', 'when', 'Joey', 'Drayton', 'Katharine', 'Houghton', 'bringing', 'home', 'brand', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'Dr.', 'John', 'Wade', 'Prentice', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'meet', 'parents', 'what', 'shock', 'parents', 'Matt', 'Christina', 'Drayton', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'are', 'have', 'Joey', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'African', 'American', 'older', 'intend', 'marry', 'almost', 'immediately', 'Joey', 'parents', 'Matt', 'Christina', 'Adding', 'pile', 'people', 'emotional', 'baggage', 'are', 'John', 'Prentice', 'parents', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Prentice', 'Roy', 'Glenn', 'Beah', 'Richards', '.The', 'shock', 'parents', 'hard', 'Matt', 'Drayton', 'John', 'Prentice', 'parents', 'fly', 'home', 'San', 'Francisco', 'home', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'have', 'major', 'discussion', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'done', 'situation', 'suppose', 'days', 'there', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'such', 'absolute', 'emotional', 'meltdown', 'two', 'fathers', 'then', 'again', 'knowing', 'people', 'still', 'could', 'happen', 'even', 'times', 'Once', 'John', 'Prentice', 'parents', 'arrive', 'home', 'Joey', 'parents', 'Matt', 'Christina', 'Drayton', 'much', 'be', 'thought', 'very', 'little', 'time', 'Joey', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Dr.', 'John', 'Prentice', 'leaving', 'almost', 'immediately', 'accept', 'job', 'offer', 'Switzerland.Look', 'very', 'moving', 'scenes', 'John', 'Prentice', 'father', 'passionately', 'discuss', 'race', 'romance', 'races', 'Matt', 'Drayton', 'final', 'speech', 'daughter', 'love', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'moments', 'cinematic', 'history', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'Christina', 'Drayton', 'excellent', 'flawless', 'performance', 'Look', 'also', 'Isabel', 'Sanford', 'make', 'movie', 'debut', 'Tillie', 'maid', 'Drayton', 'home.The', 'DVD', 'little', 'extras', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'writing', 'am', 'hopeful', '40th', 'Anniversary', 're-release', 'will', 'correct', 'that.Overall', 'Guess', 'Who', 'Coming', 'Dinner', 'striking', 'memorable', 'view', 'race', 'relations', 'very', 'memorable', 'even', 'times', 'convincing', 'acting', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'moral', 'story', 'conquers', 'one', 'would', 'like', 'hold', 'dear', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'aficionados', 'quality', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed.Five', 'stars']",N/A
15932,A3KWAGK3T5FX0Q,0767821483,,"[0, 0]","Guess Who's Coming to DinnerThis is one of my favorite old school movies.  Hollywood is continuing to beat around the subject of race relations which is what makes this movie timeless.  Spencer Tracy, Audrey Hepburn & her niece (Katharine Houghton) with up and comming star; (back then) Sidney Poitier and 3-all time Hollywood favorites, accademy award winners and the top of the Hollywood all-star list, Tracy, Hepburn & Poitier with a supporting role by Isabel Sanford destined to become Weezy to George Jefferson. The premise is simple by today's standards and yet as old and complex as it was 3,000 years ago.  When people fall in love nothing else matters, not money, not fame, not color, etc.  Tracy and Hepburn play great parts as (shocked) parents of a young daughter home for a surprise visit from I think college in Hawaii.  What their daughter (played very well by Katharine Houghton) who is actually Hepburn's niece in real life does not say is that she is bringing her husband to be with her and she just shows up back home to everyone's surprise with Sidney in tow.  Sidney just happens to be a member of the ""World Health Organization"" and doctor in tropical diseases as well as being interned at Johns Hopkins is a black man.  Well you can guess what a stir this movie made back in 1967 and if you are too young to know, it was a powder keg.  Suffice it to say that as the day goes on Hepburn, the first to find out and later Tracy and eventually Sidney's parents not knowing any of this except that Sidney has met a wonderful girl and is home temporarily; plan to get married.  The direction by Stanley Kramer is top notch.  The wardrobe department back then had money to burn and with 2-academy award wins you can't go wrong if you like old school movies with heart you will enjoy this one.  The best or at least my favorite part of the movie is Spencer Tracy's speech at the end of the movie is Tracey at his best.  If it dosen't touch the heart, nothing will.  Great movie, a must for your academy award collection and in this day and time when four-letter word movies can get a PG-13 rating, you can safely take the entire family on this ""joy-ride"" of a tender and significant movie.

Its an interesting movie, unfolding the racial prejudices of the time like an onion, and manages to be both insightful and flawed.  It expertly reveals the characters racial prejudices, both through their words and through their little non-verbal cues.  But the film does set John up as the perfect Negro man for their lilly white daughter, a world reknowned doctor.  They explore the racial prejudice against him, but say nothing of how they treat their black maid who is supposedly family but ordered around and spoken down to.  But these inconsistancies don't ruin the film, and you have to take into account how revolutionary it was for its time. It has the magnificent Sidney Poiter, who gives this electrifying little monolouge close to the end to his close-minded father:John Prentice: You don't even know what I am, Dad, you don't know who I am. You don't know how I feel, what I think. And if I tried to explain it the rest of your life you will never understand. You are 30 years older than I am. You and your whole lousy generation believes the way it was for you is the way it's got to be. And not until your whole generation has lain down and died will the dead weight be off our backs!The look on his face when he gets to the part about his whole generation lying down to die is just amazing.  Its angry and sad and confrontational and heartfelt all at the same time.  Katherin Hepburn and Spencer Tracy are also excellent.  And while the film is dated (very dated some may say) I think that is still applicable today.  Just read this next bit of dialouge and think of the many challenges facing gay people today, whose marriage is not legal in 49 of our states today:Matt Drayton: But you do know, I'm sure you know, what you're up against. There'll be 100 million people right here in this country who will be shocked and offended and appalled and the two of you will just have to ride that out, maybe every day for the rest of your lives.

15946,A2C7BOQVFH1HLE,0767821483,,"[0, 2]","This is an excellent movie and it's unsurprising given the quality of the great script; both almost always go together after all.  I'm glad to hear from some of the other reviewers that this film is obsolete in the U.S. although I have my doubts but speaking as an international viewer, this film is still so relevant even today.  I've known people who are still the butt of insults and dirty looks just because for example one is a dark skinned Indian while his wife is a fair skinned Chinese.  Being tanned myself, I've had to put up with nasty stares sometimes whenever I happen to be having lunch with a pretty Chinese colleague even TODAY!  I wish all racists could watch this movie and especially listen to the brilliant speech at the end by Spencer Tracy's character.  Having experienced racism first hand, I can attest and relate to everything in that speech and I totally agree with him that the way to lick this is to pity the stupidity and ignorance and have an attitude of ""screw"" the ""bastards"" as he so ably put it.  One thing about Singaporean women that I've noticed is that for the most part they are very strong characters and when it comes to matters of the heart they can very ably overcome the ""bastards"" on their own anyway.  The irritation comes from even having in this day and age when science through genetic and mitochondrial DNA research has already proven that every human on earth today can trace their ancestry to one Central African Male who lived about 60,000 years ago to even have to put up with ridiculous notions of racial supremacy in any way shape or form.  And to think that most of those disapproving starers I'm talking about are even tertiary ""educated"" too.What makes this film great is that there are many great scenes that address the anti-racist theme very well.  I thought the scenes with Tilly were very revealing; especially stunning was the fact that she herself would perpetuate the discrimination in an almost jealous fit being unable to see a ""Black man step out of his place"" as she kept telling Joanna and anyone who would listen.  The actress who played Tilly actually goes on to bigger things on television as Mrs Jefferson in that hit sitcom ""The Jeffersons"".Also very good was the scene where Prentice senior and junior face off in which Junior tells Senior that while Senior sees himself as a Black man, Junior sees himself simply as a man.  That line really struck a chord in me and is really the best way to defeat racism by insisting upon looking at yourself as just a man belonging to the human race no matter how much others try to convince you to do otherwise as has unfortunately happened with Tilly and Prentice senior.Some have questioned the need to make Poitier's character so successful but I disagree as I think it's extremely important that this is so so that the audience is left with no doubt that any objection to the marriage is racially motivated.  One could argue had he been poor that the objection was naturally based upon any normal parents fearing that their daughter would not have a roof over her head.It was nice to see too that after the initial shock it is clear that Spencer Tracy's character's objections were not at all racially motivated but instead were born out of his great love for his daughter and out of his fear that she would be hurt by the actions of others.  He realised as evidenced in his speech at the end that his fear and objections would be playing right into the hands of the racists and again the best way would be to have an attitude of ""screw"" the ""bastards"" as he put is so well.The cast is excellent all around and with great acting, great writing and a great soundtrack it's no wonder that this is such a great film that unfortunately is still relevant anywhere around the world where racism still exists.The only problem is with this dvd version which hasn't been restored either picture or sound quality-wise and doesn't have any bonus features worth mentioning.  Here's hoping a Blu-ray version with vastly improved picture and sound quality options will surface soon.  By all means watch this film although you may want to wait for better quality dvd versions to become available first.",3,Excellent Movie!

While I was too young in the 60's to understand or experience the injustices this film addresses, I still was able to get into the mindset and feeling of the times.  Today's young viewer might have to first approach a viewing with an understanding of how very unsettling the concept of mixed marriages were (and still are, to some extent) at the time.  Consider that, until around 1968, racially mixed marriages were still illegal in some states! Blows the mind, doesn't it?Anyway, Spencer Tracy's climactic speech at the end makes this film worth a viewing, and a worthy addition to any classics collection.  I recall not being very impressed with the bride-to-be character----too idealistic, simplistic, naive, and without any depth to her personality.  Why on earth would Poitier be interested in her, unless she was the proverbial, lilly-white, status-enhancing trophy for the class-conscious black man?

Then I was appalled when Hepburn won over Dunaway, Bancroft, etc. Then Rose's screenplay won over ""Bonnie & Clyde"". That idiot Academy!! Well, things have changed, and this film has definitely survived the test of time. There's really no question that Hepburn won because of her devotion to Tracy (in his last role). She certainly didn't reach the depth of Dunaway or Bancroft, or the Great Dame Edith Evans (who should've won for ""The Whisperers""). I thought the screenplay of William Rose was a bit gratuitous, but, as I said, that was then. Inter-racial marriage is prevalent in all levels of society today.  I've always admired Stanley Kramer, and ""It's a Mad (4) World"" was his only discernable light-hearted film. He missed on a few marks here, though; he allowed some unforgiveable mugging from Tracy, as well as some banal banter between Tracy & Cecil Kellaway. Isabel Sanford stole the show with over-the-top wisecracks, but it was Beah Richards who was nominated as Poitier's mother. That year, she also played the disreputable Mama Kaleba in ""In the Heat of the Night, and the opposing characters that she delivered were both impressive. Poitier was confident and sure, typically fine; Katharine Houghton (Hepburn's niece) was overly affected to the point of distraction. I think Rose's screenplay isn't the problem, but Kramer's direction, to allow the editing of Robert C. Jones to include cuteness between the baffled leads. (Jones was nominated, so was Kramer: whose fault?) After a few years I'm looking at this film again; there are three GREAT scenes...First, when Hepburn tells her store manager (Virginia Christine) to get lost; next when Beah Richards talks to Hepburn and then to Tracy, telling him he's a dried up shell of a man, like her husband; then Tracy's final, wonderful speech before they have dinner. These moments are worth your time and effort, especially Richards' two scenes. The bottom line is that it's a beautifully constructed film, with a somewhat unbelievable premise. All together it's enjoyable, and knowing the elements behind this production make it better. There's no question that Hepburn is great, but this is an Oscar that was given for reasons other than greatness of acting. Bancroft should've won this year; Hepburn should've won in 1962 when Bancroft won (for ""Long Day's Journey Into Night"". Hepburn as a drug-addict? Wow!) I still watch this film and watch it repeatedly; it's hard to describe this film because it's so admittedly corny, but the GREAT moments really slap you in the face.

This story to many a parent when it was first released I'm sure was the ultimate nightmare...your child becoming engaged to someone outside your race.  As parents of the daughter, Spencer Tracy is at his crustiest while Hepburn is his perfect accompaniment as usual as his loving opposition.  Poitier (prospective fianc?) is at his most gallant, while Roy S. Glenn's boisterous turn as Mr. Prentiss (father) sums up his feelings of both fathers with the question...""Are you going to tell me that you approve of what's been going on here?!!!""  While Tracy's powerful soliloquy at the end is memorable and moving it's Beah Richard's (Mrs Prentiss) performance as the voice of reason that brings the day's chaotic scene into focus, and is the one I treasure most in this film.  The whole mix is like a train wreck about to happen.  You know it's coming but you can't look away.  The questions about their futures, what people will think of them. What do they see in each other... are all here out in the open. For all to ponder.I've read some reviews asking questions like that or what does he see in such a young, na?ve, simplistic person (Katharine Houghton/Joey); and saying how unrealistic this film is.  I just have a very hard time with people being categorized like a kitchen product and on a grocery store shelf.  Education, age, intellect, race, religion  is sadly blended into all of those comments.  I'm at a loss as to why any of this matters at all. Why try to reason any of it?  It seems shortsighted and defeats the whole meaning of the film. The point of the film I feel is you can't control who you may fall for. Stanley Kramer had the guts to put it out there with a major mainstream, LIKABLE cast to draw in the masses that ordinarily wouldn't go near a movie like this at that time and challenge everyone to think about ""the unthinkable"".The pivotal ""What happens when men grow old?"" speech that Beah Richard delivered impeccably in the last 20 minutes of the movie gets me every time.  Her phrasing, tears and dignified composure makes the delivery of her speech an absolute masterpiece that ties together all the loose ends of these characters so beautifully.  This thought provoking film no matter how dated some aspects of it may be, was daring for it's time on a very taboo subject which is considered taboo even today.  The real test of attitudes today is in the commercials that are on TV which are suppose to appeal to the general population's likes and dislikes.  Madison Avenue is terrified of offending, thus not truly reflecting the changes all around them.  After 30 some odd years interracial couples are rarely if ever seen in ads, so it's not as dated as people want to think.  What DOES happen when men grow old (Madison Ave.)?  It seems theySTILL......

Spencer Tracy is absolutely brilliant in his final screen appearance as the avowed liberal newspaper publisher Matt Drayton, who, along with his idealistic wife (a role that earned Katherine Hepburn her second Best Actress Oscar) learns that their barely-20-year-old daughter is planning to elope with a black physician (played with cool passion by Sidney Poitier). The story evolves from Poitier's confidence in the two shocked parents that, without their full approval, the marriage will not go on -- and there are only hours to decide.  Add his parents to the mix, and as the list of dinner guests grows so does the tension.  Aside from the marvelous script, memorable performances and outstanding direction, photography and music there is a chemistry in the mix that truly creates an energy greater than the sum of its parts -- and when the parts are this good, the result is a film for the ages that goes straight to the heart of themes like love, passion, prejudice and family conflict.  In the end love does conquor all in Tracey's powerful final speech, made more poignant by a visibly moved and misty Hepburn -- perhaps cognizant that she was witnessing the final curtain call of a great actor.

Katherine Houghton sings more softly for she carries the torch for youth and innocence (supposedly representing the generation that does away with racism - from 40 years on how we wish that THAT at least were true!)But even if you think you know the story, and you think there's no reason to see it because it is so dated, BUY THIS DISC and add it to your collection for the performance of a lifetime: Beah Richards as Mrs. Prentice (Sidney's mom) will, in the middle of a movie designed to make you think, reach right into the center of your being and break your heart, just as her's is breaking. Her scenes bring this movie to a higher level - high and deserved praise seeing as Tracy and Hepburn set the bar.It wasn't meant to cure the evil. It, in truth, hardly acknowledges the evil of racism (perhaps the most valid criticism that can be made) but it did, in it's time, a miraculous thing: it answered the question ""Is it wrong for men and women of different races to marry?"" -the answer, simply,: ""No.""",5,An older person's perspective....,1094947200,"09 12, 2004",2004,1766,"['saw', 'movie', 'theatre', 'week', 'was', 'released', 'perspective', 'nearly', '40', 'years', 'later', 'believe', 'still', 'up.There', 'much', 'evidence', 'show', 'was', 'not', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'subject', 'matter', 'even', 'late', 'sixties', 'even', 'less', 'recognisable', 'now', 'Guess', 'Who', 'Coming', 'Dinner', 'not', 'documentary', 'even', 'later', 'invention', 'docudrama', 'theatre', 'theatre', 'characters', 'are', 'given', 'point', 'view', 'goal', 'obstacles', 'Notice', 'reality', 'not', 'prerequisite', 'So', 'given', 'are', 'watching', 'art', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'can', 'say', 'film', 'strongest', 'performances', 'ever', 'committed', 'celuloid', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'Katherine', 'Houghton', 'more', 'softly', 'torch', 'youth', 'innocence', 'supposedly', 'representing', 'generation', 'away', 'racism', '40', 'years', 'how', 'wish', 'least', 'were', 'true', 'even', 'think', 'know', 'story', 'think', 'reason', 'see', 'so', 'dated', 'BUY', 'THIS', 'DISC', 'add', 'collection', 'performance', 'lifetime', 'Beah', 'Richards', 'Mrs.', 'Prentice', 'Sidney', 'mom', 'will', 'middle', 'movie', 'designed', 'make', 'think', 'reach', 'right', 'center', 'being', 'break', 'heart', 'just', 'breaking', 'scenes', 'bring', 'movie', 'higher', 'level', 'high', 'deserved', 'praise', 'seeing', 'Tracy', 'Hepburn', 'set', 'bar.It', 'was', ""n't"", 'meant', 'cure', 'evil', 'truth', 'hardly', 'evil', 'racism', 'perhaps', 'most', 'valid', 'criticism', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'did', 'time', 'miraculous', 'thing', 'answered', 'question', 'wrong', 'men', 'women', 'different', 'races', 'marry', '-the', 'answer', 'simply']",N/A

15967,A103KNDW8GN92L,0767821483,David Hugaert,"[3, 4]","The year 1967 was one where three subjects were on the minds of many Americans: the hippie revolution, war and predjudicism/racism. The latter is very well documented in the Stanley Kramer directorial epic &quot;Guess Who's Coming To Dinner&quot;, in that its subject, interracial relationships, somewhat examines the various types of prejudices people were casting out during that era. The movie begins with an elitist couple, Dr. John Prentice and Joey Drayton (both craftfully played by Oscar nominee Sidney Poitier and Katharine Houghton), who are experiencing a romantic high after meeting on vacation in Hawaii. Tired from the trip, Dr. Prentice wants a little r &amp; r at a hotel, but Joey insists that The Good Doctor meet her upper class parents, so they imediately go to Joey's mother's place of employment, only to find her mother isn't there, then it's on to Joey's parents' home. Upon Mrs. Drayton's (played brilliantly to an Academy award nominated performance by Katharine Hepburn) first glance of Dr. Prentice, she is both shocked and amazed of the prospect that the doctor is black. Much the same is true about Mr. Drayton's postion on the situation (also played to an award-winning performance by Spencer Tracy), who's even more shocked and appalled over his daughter's relationship with Dr. Prentice than his wife is. The Drayton's maid Tillie (played wonderfully by Isabel Sanford [of &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;]) isn't all that crazy about Dr. Prentice, either, and sees him as nothing more than an arrogant, uppity man who enjoys getting what he wants, but that's further from the truth, as Joey sees Dr. Prentice as a kind, wonderful human being whom she wants to marry. As time progresses forward, Mrs. Drayton softens up in her stance concerning the relationship, while Mr. Drayton's stance gets even more firm with each passing moment. Note the painstakingly intense expression on Spencer Tracy's face during the many scenes of this picture. You can understand why he's been nominated for various awards throughout various points of his career. When Dr. Prentice's parents are invited to dinner, it seems that all hell will break loose, as both families continue to analyze the situation further. Even with some trite coddling and persuasion from Mrs. Drayton, she still is not able to sell the mixed marriage idea to her husband. At the same time, Dr. Prentice is having just as much difficulty in getting his father, and in certain instances his mother, to see the benefits of this relatinship. Notice the scene where Dr. Prentice stands up to his father. Sidney Poitier's remarkably intense, emotional acting style is unmistakable here, as he lets loose a temper with such fire and gusto. 1967 was perhaps Sidney Poitier's finest moment in theater, as he starred in three of the hottest movies that year: as the soft and stern scholteacher in &quot;To Sir, With Love&quot;, as the convincing Virgil Tibbs in &quot;In The Heat Of The Night&quot; and in &quot;Guess Who's Coming To Dinner&quot;, all fine performances, indeed.As tensions continue to surface between both John and Joey's paternal parents, it is up to the Drayton's pastoral advisor, Monsignor Ryan, to talk some sense into the disrupted parties. He finally succeeds in the end, as one of the most emotional scenes in the movie occurs, courtesy of Katharine Hepburn. While on the road to Mr. Drayton's changing his mind about the marriage proceedings, which he comes to accept, Mrs. Drayton lets out a tear filled display of emotion that only Ms. Hepburn can create, which explains her wealth of fandom, not to mention several Oscar and Academy awards on her mantle throughout her glorious career. As is expected, all's well that ends well, as John and Joey are off to Switzerland for their wedding, which tearfully, we never get to witness. It is because of this fine film's theme, including its stunning cast, that makes &quot;Guess Who's Coming To Dinner&quot; worthy of being in any motion picture connoisseur's video library.

Pawl ""Dani""","[2, 2]","GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER stars the wonderful Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy (in his last screen role--Tracy died just seventeen days after shooting wrapped for the picture) as a progressive couple who raised their daughter to share their values and ""color blind"" attitude.  It is when their daughter ""Joey"" Joanna (Katharine Houghton) brings home her intended, an accomplished doctor, John (Sidney Poitier), who also happens to be African-American that the values they instilled in their daughter are truly put to the test.  Eventually, both sets of parents plan to meet for dinner (hence, the title) in order to discuss the union and whether or not the families will support the young couple's decision to marry.GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER certainly stands the test of time forty years later. It is one of the most unflinchingly honest and intelligent films that examines the tensions and pressures a young interracial couple must face in the eye of great opposition in society.  Though, some might call DINNER ""dated"" I think it very well-encapsulates the convictions and views of mixed race relationships and marriage that were prevalent in the mid-1960s.  This was the era of the Civil Rights Movement, activism and demonstrations in favor of racial equality.  What's more, as one character puts it, intermarriage was considered a crime in seventeen states (particularly in the South), during that time.

15969,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,0767821483,Ed Uyeshima,"[8, 9]","Somehow this 1967 film classic still works perhaps because it's not as dated as one would hope it would be. I was motivated to see this film for the umpteenth time since I recently saw the rather toothless partial remake, ""Guess Who"" with Bernie Mac and Ashton Kutcher. The plot is fairly low-key taking place mostly in the upscale San Francisco home of Matt and Christina Drayton, a crusading liberal newspaper publisher and his art gallery-owning wife. That's the set-up for their daughter Joey's surprise return from her vacation in Hawaii with an unexpected fiancee in tow.The fact that the Draytons are white and the fiancee, John Wade Prentice, is black provides the focus of the plot, but make no mistake that the casting of screen legends Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn as the Draytons and Sidney Poitier - then one of the most popular stars - as Prentice alters the reality of the situation considerably. There are also several plot contrivances that seem suitable for this story but not in real-life, for instance, the increasingly imminent departure of the young couple to Geneva, Prentice's statement to the Draytons that a marriage will not happen without their approval, Joey's constant impulsiveness and her seemingly cavalier attitude toward the sensitivities of others.Yet what continues to be surprising is that the film's glamorization of interracial romance among the wealthy does not detract from its sheer entertainment value. Despite the seriousness of the subject, especially at the height of the civil rights movement, director Stanley Kramer - in his typically socially conscious mode - and screenwriter William Rose have fashioned mostly a drawing room comedy that turns heavier and more significant with the last dramatic scenes.Because this is more an ensemble piece, it barely feels like a Tracy-Hepburn film, especially since they look very settled as a long-ago married couple. They do have a few scenes together where you can strongly feel the natural onscreen rapport that had lasted for 25 years - the Oregon boysenberry scene, the walk through their patio as she cuts the flowers, the lasting stare between them at the end. In his last film finished a little over two weeks before his death, Tracy looks far older than his 67 years but still does masterful work as Drayton, a man who unexpectedly finds himself at odds with his values with his daughter's sudden announcement. His famous climactic monologue is the film's understandable high point, but he also does wonders listening to everyone else's thoughts and opinions.Hepburn imbues her trademark independent spirit in what seems to be an observational role. Considering she was in-between her morphine-addicted Mary Tyrone in ""Long Day's Journey Into Night"" and her vengeful Eleanor of Aquitaine in ""The Lion in Winter"", her seemingly passive role here hardly seems worthy of her time except for the way she looks at Tracy or Katharine Houghton (her real-life niece) or in a couple of meaty confrontation scenes - the first with her bigoted gallery manager whom she tells with contained fury to ""get permanently lost"" and the second an ultimatum in the bathroom to Matt should he not condone the marriage.Poitier seems comfortable portraying an incredibly accomplished man but really does not catch dramatic fire until the last half-hour when he confronts his own father about his feelings. Houghton, relentlessly perky to the point of strangulation, has a relatively thankless role as Joey as she is the catalyst for the plot machinations but has no scene which allows her character to respond verbally to the groundswell of problems the situation has caused for those around her. This may have been intentional, but it creates an odd, somewhat selfish imbalance to her character.Beah Richards has a few quietly powerful moments as Prentice's mother, who accuses Drayton rather vicariously of forgetting what it's like to be in love.

Some reviewers criticized the film's story of interracial romance, as being unrealistic since Poitier played a black man who had impeccable and unprecedented credentials for the time. This in some people's minds made the difference of his and his fianc&eacute;'s race hardly a factor. Kramer pointed out that that was his exactly his point. He wanted to put Poitier and his fianc&eacute;e on an even playing field where their only differences could only be the color of their skin. Therefore, was there really a difference? On another level this was Spencer Tracy's last performance and a heartfelt one at that. Katharine Hepburn stalwartly stands by her gallant partner (of on and off the screen) especially during his eloquently spoken last words to all concerned and that deep love and devotion for this now old, bent over and frail man comes through heartbreakingly true.

This film is wonderful because it was made by one of Hollywood's greatest duos, Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy. I doubt audiences back then would respond to this if it wasn't for the duo. Although it would not shock me if people then would be thinking Hollywood had finally lost its edge with this one. It was a keen decision to have Kate and Spencer be the leads because in doing so they were assuring not only box-office draw -- people would be returning to watch their favorite unmarried couple bicker, lovingly, yet again -- but a strong statement.This film was made while Spencer Tracy was dying. Spencer had to put his entire salary in escrow in order for the film company to allow him to do the film. So why did Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy agree to do this film, without immediate payment? Because it's a film about forbidden love, it's a film about loving someone no matter what society thinks, or what the rules are. This is something Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn knew a great deal about. Potier of course turns in a great performance, impeccable as always. Watch for Isabel Sanford, (""The Jefferson's"") particularly the one memorable scene where she explains to Potier's character just what ""black power"" really is. Cecil Kellaway sparkles as Monsignor Ryan, and Beah Richards and Roy Glenn, as the parents to Potier's character, mirror Hepburn and Tracy. Katharine Houghton (Hepburn's niece), as Johanna Drayton, also done well but her inexperience is very apparent due to the heavyweight cast.What makes this film outstanding is, by the end of the film you realize, Kate and Spencer are not even acting they are relaying their feelings about each other, through the film. Once you catch that, the drama of the final few scenes is just unparalleled and Spencer's final speech, about his love for Kate (Christina), can drive even the most twisted soul to tears.A few things to catch in this film, watch Kate's face when Spencer recites the line, 'screw what the rest of the world thinks about your love'...those are real tears. Watch Spencer Tracey as he paces back and forth on the terrace near the end of the film. He realizes he is about to begin one of the last scenes he will ever film. He's line 'well I'll be a son of a bitch'...is more a realization he's about to make his last grandstand on the big screen, in his entire career.There is so much real honest-to-god acting talent concentrated in this movie, it.

Martin Luther King, Jr. was criticizing the war, and Loving v. Virginia was striking down any remaining state bans on interracial marriage.  Into the fray came this movie about a white woman and a black man getting married.  Even though we'd been more than 100 years removed from the 13th Amendment, and nearly a hundred from the 14th, and LBJ had already signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a movie about interracial marriage still had to come as a bombshell.  Honestly, I still think it would today.  I'm hard-pressed to think of a mixed-race movie or television couple, though I'm sure I'm just overlooking something.The acting in this movie is phenomenal--no other word for it.  If you can believe it, I'd never seen Katharine Hepburn in a movie before.  The way she told off her friend--incredible.  The way she said ""you're burning your shirt,"" while Joey is ironing, then proceeds to take the iron and burn the shirt herself--amazing.  The way she stood up to her husband....  Female roles in movies these days don't seem to be as strong, as self-assured.  Yet Hepburn is also sympathetic at the same time.  Breathtaking.I'll admit it--I don't always buy the romance between Sidney Poitier and Katharine Houghton.  They don't have many scenes together, and those they do have don't have much chemistry.  Plus, the scene with the steak delivery feels horribly contrived and silly.  But those aren't the point of the movie: it's about being suddenly tested to see if you can defend your principles, practice what you preach.  It's about the power of love, and about people becoming old and set in their ways.  I loved the line (paraphrasing here) ""There's nothing funnier than a phony liberal being confronted with his beliefs.""Very few movies explore race in such a raw, honest way.  Spike Lee's ""Do the Right Thing"" comes to mind, and I'm sure there are others I haven't seen.  We need to keep exploring.

This is what drew me into the story and made it one of my favorite classic movies.Tho the parents of each were taken aback upon finding out that one was black and the other white the ""kids"" were trying to get the parents to understand that times were changing and that they were willing to join in the ""change"" and to fight together and opposions that they may face, as well as trying to teach their parents that because someone is different does not make them any less of a person.A true classic for everyone at all ages, it can really teach us all a lesson.",5,Another Hepburn/Tracy classic,1323302400,"12 8, 2011",2011,1583,"['movie', 'dared', 'cross', 'lines', 'when', 'was', 'made', 'still', 'same', 'lines', 'today.Tho', 'many', 'people', 'pick', 'apart', 'movie', 'say', 'different', 'questions', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'asked', 'instead', 'questioning', 'relatinship', 'male', 'black', 'doctor', 'white', 'college', 'female', 'actually', 'look', 'depth', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'get', 'better', 'understanding', 'what', 'writer', 'director', 'producer', 'was', 'trying', 'say', 'know', 'Sidney', 'would', 'not', 'do', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'believe', 'did', 'movie', 'bring', 'home', 'point', 'color', 'ones', 'skin', 'not', 'matter', 'heart', 'point', 'still', 'trying', 'be', 'made', 'very', 'day.This', 'love', 'story', 'older', 'male', 'younger', 'female', 'point', 'movie', 'love', 'when', 'something', 'as', 'cosmetic', 'skin', 'color', 'fell', 'love', 'depths', 'other', 'had', 'taken', 'time', 'look', 'physical', 'differences', 'delve', 'what', 'things', 'make', 'who', 'are', 'inside', 'what', 'drew', 'story', 'made', 'one', 'favorite', 'classic', 'movies.Tho', 'parents', 'were', 'taken', 'aback', 'finding', 'out', 'one', 'was', 'black', 'other', 'white', 'kids', 'were', 'trying', 'get', 'parents', 'understand', 'times', 'were', 'changing', 'were', 'willing', 'join', 'change', 'fight', 'together', 'opposions', 'may', 'face', 'as', 'well', 'trying', 'teach', 'parents', 'someone', 'different', 'not', 'make', 'less', 'person.A', 'true', 'classic', 'everyone', 'ages', 'can', 'really', 'teach', 'lesson']",N/A

The filmmakers are simply trying to say what they believe.  This film is plain and simple, a soapbox.  Nothing wrong with that.The performances are another reason to watch this movie.  Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn are worth watching in anything.  Poiter doesn't give a performance quite up to par for him, but it is satisfactory.  Poiter's parents are also great.There are some spectacular moments here.  Great monologue by Tracy at the end makes the entire film worth watching.  I don't cry about a film or book or tv show.  I can count on one hand the number of times I have actually cried over a piece of mass media.  Tears came to my eyes during this wonderful speech.  They didn't break and run, but they were there.The film is sightly weighted down by a plodding midsection, but on retrospect I think it might have been made that way on purpose.  Will there ever come a time when people of different color can live together in harmony?  I think so.

The problem, of course, is that John is African-American. A perfect son-in-law in every possible way, Joey is absolutely positive her wealthy, liberal (progressive) parents will wholeheartedly endorse their 'mixed' marriage. Wrong!! Being progressive was fine as long as it was someone else's life that was affected. Can the Draytons reconcile their values and the values they raised Joey to live by and the real-life situation at hand? To complicate matters, John is leaving the country that evening and has told them privately, he will cancel the marriage plans if they do not unreservedly support their marriage before he leaves. Many, if not most, of you are familiar with the story. It was shocking at the time. No black man had ever kissed a white woman on the 'big screen'. There were 16 states with laws on the books that made interracial marriages illegal. Stanly Kramer was indeed making a social statement with this movie. As a Jewish man, he knew prejudice first hand. As a result of this movie the laws were changed in all 16 states. Do movies influence culture?? Remember GIDEON'S TRUMPET. Watch this movie for what it was-a statement about racial prejudice but also ask yourself where are the injustices today that need to be fixed? How can we become part of the solution? A great movie then and still today.

It's nice to see him being recognized for his willingness to do that.It's easy for a younger generation to look at this film and ask ""what is all the fuss"" but if you were a college student or high school kid back in the 60's, you'd know why seeing a black white romance on the screen was a big event.Even if you have an earlier release of this film, owning this one is well worth the expense.",5,40th anniversary edition worth the wait,1202860800,"02 13, 2008",2008,1410,"['new', 'edition', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'put', 'together.The', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'color', 'vibrant.The', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'Quincy', 'Jones', 'commenting', 'time', 'period', 'when', 'film', 'appeared', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'helpful', 'who', 'were', ""n't"", 'around', '1960', 'see', 'civil', 'rights', 'movement', 'will', 'help', 'make', 'clear', 'film', 'was', 'groundbreaking', 'why', 'recognition', 'director', 'actors', 'who', 'worked', 'it.Katharine', 'Houghton', 'comments', 'portrayal', 'Joey', 'as', 'well', 'tasks', 'other', 'actors', 'faced', 'bringing', 'characters', 'life', 'are', 'insightful', 'intelligent.Her', 'commments', 'Aunt', 'Katharine', 'Hepburn', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'are', 'warm', 'loving', 'beautifully', 'stated.The', 'two', 'featurettes', 'A', 'Love', 'Story', 'Today', 'A', 'Special', 'Kind', 'Love', 'feature', 'many', 'stills', 'fan', 'film', 'stars', 'will', 'enjoy', 'seeing.Stanley', 'Kramer', 'was', 'never', 'afraid', 'tackle', 'difficult', 'subject', 'hold', 'out', 'people', 'see', 'nice', 'see', 'being', 'recognized', 'willingness', 'do', 'that.It', 'easy', 'younger', 'generation', 'look', 'film', 'ask', 'what', 'fuss', 'were', 'college', 'student', 'high', 'school', 'kid', 'back', '60', ""'d"", 'know', 'why', 'seeing', 'black', 'white', 'romance', 'screen', 'was', 'big', 'event.Even', 'have', 'earlier', 'release', 'film', 'owning', 'one', 'well', 'expense']",N/A
15983,A129YBX5BVNW2,0767821483,"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry""","[4, 5]","Sometimes a movie isn't a movie - sometimes it's more than that. And ""Guess Who's Coming To Dinner"" is one of those great moments in our troubled existence when a movie took on a real issue and became something more that entertainment, it became important, even a catalyst for change - change that's ongoing to this day.It starts very badly. A jet plane crosses the city sky to dated girly vocals and naff strings. The lyrics of ""The Glory Of Love"" waft out at us, ""You've got to cry a little...die a little..."" Oh God! Immediately you feel this is an overrated and fiercely dated Hollywood outing, and while it may have been groundbreaking then, it's cheesy now. And worse - it seems to be smug and knowing - the Tinsel Town hypocrites doing ""brave"", but in a typically sanitised and acceptable way.But then it improves almost immediately. Like a breath of fresh air, Katherine Houghton (niece of Hepburn) and an impossibly handsome and debonair Sidney Poiter float onto the screen beaming and hugging. Immediately they look the part - in love - and ready to take on the whole wide world and its crappy prejudices with a lump hammer.  They're met by Virginia Christine, who plays Hilary St. George, assistant to Hepburn's character, Mrs. Drayton. She shiftily eyes the mixed couple and asks with her staunch steely white distaste, ""Has something happened? Is anything wrong?"" Haughton replies (too much in love to notice the meanness) ""Something's happened! But it's right!""Actually, Houghton is one of the movie's secret weapons; her unfolding strength and joie-de-vie positively invigorating and constantly countering the pontificating of the elders. She, of course, represents young love, youth that doesn't give a fiddlers nadge about other people's opinions because it's empowered and alive. One such example is her conversation with Tilly, the family's black Maid, who's dead set against the union from the off. Haughton reasons. ""You so wrong Tilly! You know I've always loved you - and you're just as black as he is! How could it possibly be right for me to love you - and yet be wrong for me to love him?"" And on it goes - witty to dark and back again.Briefly, the story is this; Hepburn comes home to a surprise from her daughter - she's met a man ten days earlier and is deeply in love - or so she claims - but he's a Negro. Dad Tracy comes home too and he's not happy either - even dismissive, decision made too hastily, too much too soon, obvious problems ahead, what were they thinking?? Then Poitier's black parents arrive into town (beautifully played by a graceful Beah Richards and a forceful Roy E. Glenn Snr) and things get very awkward and then very heavy. And it's from here that the movie moves into true greatness with the screenplay by William Rose being one of the heroes of the hour (won the Oscar).Both parents make good argument. Roy E Glenn Snr. as Poitier's father informs his boy of some sobering facts - their marriage in 1967 is illegal in 17 States (and even now it's chilling to know that fact).  Both parents try of course to browbeat their siblings into rethinking their positions, when it should be they, who need to do some ""rethinking"". But these are good fathers - and with rebuttals, good argument and applied intelligence, both begin to see the light. The scene where Poitier confronts his Dad about a son owing his pater nothing, about his Father's generation being dead weight because they're trapped in the clich&eacute;s of old they won't try to break free from -  is just breathtaking in its writing and scope - shockingly good!Then it gets better still. Both Beah Richards and Katharine Hepburn agree with the union; they know their men don't - so both try to reason with their opposite. But it's Beah's talk to Tracy (who listens) that swings it; she talks about men being old, becoming stale and then losing their passion and forgetting what it was like to be young and in love and needing somebody like they were the air. It's fantastically written and delivered with grace and poise (she was Oscar nominated). Then Tracy simply spends the next few minutes of screen time pacing about, looking out over the metropolis and thinking. Then he thinks and ruminates a little more. And then a revelation! ""I'll be a son of a bitch!"" He makes his way back into the house to gather all parties together in the same room to hear THE BIG SPEECH. And it's an absolute knockout! He recaps on each person and their viewpoint - good and bad. He looks at Beah Richards who chastised him - not with malice but with affection. He touches on her point of love diminishing over the years, ""Old - yes! Burnt out - certainly! But I can tell you, the memories are still there - clear, intact, indestructible...""But there are things about the film that grate. For a movie that concerns itself so much with colour and equality, it's extraordinary that the black actors playing Poitier's parents didn't get equal billing with the principal four on the posters and subsequent artwork - despite both being Oscar-nominated! And why does any black person have to have the patriarchal nod from the senior white folks for their union to be ok anyway!  But these are more reflections of the time the movie was made. It doesn't detract from it too much. This was a maverick film made with maverick actors in maverick times.On the 10th of June 1967, aged 67 and just two weeks after filming had finished (it was finally released in March 1968 just in time for Oscars), Spencer Tracy was at home and couldn't sleep. Hepburn was upstairs too - despite her real home being a short distance away. He made himself a tea, sat at the table and suffered a massive and fatal heart attack. His body hit the table but it was the cup that crashed to the floor. The drinking had finally done for him. In her memoirs she romantically wrote ""I crouched down and took you up in my arms, dead. No life, no pulse...my dear, dear friend, gone."" Together for 28 years in all but marriage, Hepburn was there truly ""in sickness and in health..."" loving him to the end - and when you return to the scene where they look at each other at the end of his speech (see below) - and you know this - you realise the acting between these two had stopped long ago - their devotion and respect and love for each other was real.Guess Whose Coming To Dinner is a movie you should own or return to soon. A reminder of when Hollywood genuinely touched you while occasionally touching on the real issues that affect us all to this day. (The title is dialogue between Tracy and his priest about race in the USA, Tracy first, then the priest).Let's finish with the words of the Mighty Spence before he looks at Katherine Hepburn:""...Because in the final analysis, it doesn't matter what we think of them. The only thing that matters is what they feel, and how much they feel it for each other - and if it's half of what we felt - that's everything!""",5,"""Not In This Country!

The story revolves around a liberal San Francisco couple whose twenty-three year old daughter comes home from a trip to Hawaii and surprises them by announcing she's engaged to an older man who also happens to be black.  The couple, Matt &amp; Christina Drayton, is played by screen legends Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn.  Sidney Poitier, Dr. John Prentice, is the fianc&eacute; and Katharine Houghton, Joey Drayton, (who is Ms. Hepburn's niece) is their daughter.  Matt &amp; Christina are obviously shaken by the news and concerned about the situation.  It is not because they are prejudice against minorities as their daughter is marrying a black man, but it is against the struggles she will face in such a relationship.  Also, the doctor has put it to them that if they do not approve and give their blessings, he will call the marriage off.  They have less than twenty-four hours to make their decision and they struggle with it, especially Matt.  He is a crusading newspaper publisher who has championed liberal causes all his life, but faced with this situation, his beliefs are shaken to their core.  Throughout the day they get council from their best friend, Monsignor Ryan (a superb Cecil Kellaway, who provides them with guidance and a voice of reason.  Joey invites John's parents (Roy Glenn &amp; Beah Richards) up from Los Angeles to dinner.  Upon finding out Joey is white his parents voice their displeasure with the situation as well.  When the two sets of parents get together, the mothers agree that they will support their children because they love them, but the fathers take an opposing view.  Mr. Poitier gives a powerful and forceful retribution to his father about the state of black men in the current day and it shows why he is such a brilliant actor. In the end, Matt gives an impassioned speech to John &amp; Joey about the struggles they will face and the unkindness that will be heaped on them, but that if they truly love each they will survive.  Director Stanley Kramer does a brilliant job of making the film poignant yet not sappy.  The cast are all brilliant and Ms. Hepburn would end up taking home her second Best Actress Oscar (after a thirty-four span from her first for Morning Glory in 1933) and the film won a second Oscar for William Rose for his screenplay.  The film is definitely dated as interracial marriages are not as shocking as they were at the time and interracial couples have been the basis of countless films since then.  The film is still powerful, because prejudices still exist in this country and the quandary one has when they have their beliefs tested is all too real.  Mr. Tracy was gravelly ill at the time and it turned out that this would be his final film.

15993,AYKIGQ5L8MGL5,0767821483,"Raymond E. Parker ""Raymond Parker 'Actor,Writ...","[1, 1]","I recently read a biography of Sidney Poitier which emphasized his role as ""The Black Actor"" of his time, and what this meant culturally and politicaly during the conservative 1950's and the turbulent 1960's. Poitier's mere presence in a film during this time assured black audiences that ""Yes, there were roles of merit for blacks in Hollywood"" while simultaneously letting white people know that all blacks were not dangerous, sex-craved animals, or buffoonish syncophants, but upstanding citizens like you and me. It seemed at times that Sidney Poitier, The Icon, overshadowed many of his screen endeavors, pushing the film's plotline into the background (with the exception of ""In The Heat Of The Night"") Which brings me to ""Guess Who's Coming To Dinner"". Released in 1967 (it was the THIRD box-office hit for Poitier in a single year. A feat no other actor since, with the exception of Tom Cruise in 1996, has accomplished) an extremely tumultous year when the nation grappled with civil rights and Vietnam, ""Guess Who"" provided a fresh breath of air. Its the story of a prominent black doctor, John Prentice, who falls in love with a younger white girl,Joanna. He is 37, she is 23. The couple arrive at the girls' parents' house to announce to her parents their marriage plans. But the good doctor has a secret that he is keeping from his fiance: He has promised himself that if the father (Spencer Tracy) disagrees he will not marry her. He has come to this conclusion because he knows full well the problems the two of them will face as an interracial couple, and if they have disapproving in-laws to contend with as well, the marriage might not survive. This particular aspect of Poitier's character is what nailed it for me. What a strong statement to make, and the reserve to back it! How many of us who have been fitfully in love would EVER make a proposal like this?! Most people would say to Hell with the in laws, but this is what seperated Poitier from most stars of his day and which contributed to his overall popularity. Upon its release, the film was not a CRITICAL favorite, but it was certainly a box-office fav. The problem most critics had with the film was the preposterous love story itself. ""What would an accomplished doctor who had been married once want with a young, naive girl 14 years his junior? "" asked many critics (as if you really had to ponder THAT one!)I have never discovered why the director Stanley Kramer put this age difference into the film in the first place, the only answer I have is that Katherine Houghton was the niece of the Great Hepburn. Nepotism strikes again, right? But that was not the most gnawing question in the film. Most critics simply missed the point. A point that the movie-going public got: It is a FANTASY. Kramer over emphasized everything, from the techni-color skies to the immaculate skin complexions of his stars, to let the public know just how ridiculous skin color prejudices (and prejudices in general) are. Poitier's character is so PERFECT, that the ONLY problem Tracy and Hepburn have with him is his skin color. Brilliant.

15996,A1JUYF5D6TFFHB,0767821483,"Rudy Avila ""Saint Seiya""","[10, 12]","This 1967 Oscar winner ought to be viewed in high schools or colleges, particularly in Humanities departments and Social Studies. This is definately a lesson in Human Rights that can easily be appreciated by both whites and blacks or any people for that matter and can even be seen in class while learning about the Civil Rights Movement, considering that this film was released at a time when the Civil Rights was at its peak and about to take a different direction after the death of the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. 1967 was a difficult time, there were riots concerning racism as well as the Vietnam War. In this film, the accomplished Sidney Poitier plays Doctor John Wade Prentice, who falls madly in love with Joanna Drayton, played by the beautiful Katherine Houghton, who was related by blood to Katherine Hepburn - I think she was a niece or something. The two are clearly in love but are about to face hardships as young adults in a world that has not yet embraced multi-racial marriages. This premise is, of course, very antiquated, since we are living in 2005 and multi-racial families are very common. However, even now there are racist attitudes as well as class conflict and watching such a moving film as this one, which ultimately about the power of love conquering over opposition and ignorance, is benefitial even to this day. This film was originally a play and it is a film that captures the spirit of its time, in much the same way that Lorraine Hansberry's ""A Raisin In the Sun"" did in 1959. Outstanding performances by all the principal actors, but the real winner here is the veteran actor Spencer Tracey. This was his final film. He died shortly after the release of this film. His final monologue at the end of the film is the stuff of great actors that come along very rarely.Sidney Poitier holds his own next to Spence Tracey, using his usual dramatic flair and supreme dignity. However, it is very much debatable whether or not the fact he is a doctor makes the film significant. If he were of the working poor class, would the parents really put up more of a fight to seperate the couple ? Social status is not the issue in this film at all, since Dr Prentice's family is of the same class as Joanna Drayton's family. Despite this, it is still a fine film with moving moments. The music at the end ""Thats' the glory of Love"" is very nostalgic of 50's jingles and is super sweet to hear. This is a remarkably touching, very human story. Katherine Hepburn won an Oscar for this film, though when compared to her other work, this role is very bland. She is basically the supportive, understanding mother. She employs no pretensions, no affected dialogue and is herself throughout the film, however, and we are lead to believe that if her own daughter decided to marry a black man or a Native American man for that matter, she'd be alright with it. Hepburn, despite her classiness and patrician facade, was a very down-to-earth woman. But while I love her in this film, I still don't think it was a performance worthy of an Oscar when it should have gone to either Spencer Tracey or Sidney Poitier, who really carry most of the film. Watch closely. Tracey and Poitier are each other in a different skin color is all. Katherine Houghton is not doing anything special, though she is very definative of the preppy, high-class girls of the 50's. This film is radically different when you compare it to more ""modern"" less 50'ish films of the time like The Graduate, which came out around this time, Rosemary's Baby with its haunting notion of an absence of God and triumphant Satan, or the futuristic abstract Kubrick film 2001 A Space Odyssey. This film is still good, however, a lesson in loving one another as equals, irregardless of skin color, class (even if its not an issue in this particular film) political affiliation or religious differences. It's a very great film with powerful themes of love.",5,A Classic: A Film To Watch In A College Class,1127606400,"09 25, 2005",2005,3932,"['1967', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'ought', 'be', 'viewed', 'high', 'schools', 'colleges', 'particularly', 'Humanities', 'departments', 'Social', 'Studies', 'definately', 'lesson', 'Human', 'Rights', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'appreciated', 'whites', 'blacks', 'people', 'matter', 'can', 'even', 'be', 'seen', 'class', 'learning', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'Movement', 'considering', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'time', 'when', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'was', 'peak', 'take', 'different', 'direction', 'death', 'Reverend', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'Jr.', '1967', 'was', 'difficult', 'time', 'were', 'riots', 'concerning', 'racism', 'as', 'well', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'film', 'accomplished', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'Doctor', 'John', 'Wade', 'Prentice', 'who', 'madly', 'love', 'Joanna', 'Drayton', 'played', 'beautiful', 'Katherine', 'Houghton', 'who', 'was', 'related', 'blood', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'think', 'was', 'niece', 'something', 'two', 'are', 'clearly', 'love', 'are', 'face', 'hardships', 'young', 'adults', 'world', 'not', 'yet', 'embraced', 'multi-racial', 'marriages', 'premise', 'course', 'very', 'antiquated', 'are', 'living', '2005', 'multi-racial', 'families', 'are', 'very', 'common', 'However', 'even', 'now', 'are', 'racist', 'attitudes', 'as', 'well', 'class', 'conflict', 'watching', 'such', 'moving', 'film', 'one', 'ultimately', 'power', 'love', 'conquering', 'opposition', 'ignorance', 'benefitial', 'even', 'day', 'film', 'was', 'originally', 'play', 'film', 'spirit', 'time', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'Lorraine', 'Hansberry', 'A', 'Raisin', 'Sun', 'did', '1959', 'Outstanding', 'performances', 'principal', 'actors', 'real', 'winner', 'here', 'veteran', 'actor', 'Spencer', 'Tracey', 'was', 'final', 'film', 'died', 'shortly', 'release', 'film', 'final', 'monologue', 'end', 'film', 'stuff', 'great', 'actors', 'come', 'along', 'very', 'rarely.Sidney', 'Poitier', 'own', 'next', 'Spence', 'Tracey', 'using', 'usual', 'dramatic', 'flair', 'supreme', 'dignity', 'However', 'very', 'much', 'debatable', 'not', 'fact', 'doctor', 'film', 'significant', 'were', 'working', 'poor', 'class', 'would', 'parents', 'really', 'put', 'up', 'more', 'fight', 'seperate', 'couple', 'Social', 'status', 'not', 'issue', 'film', 'Dr', 'Prentice', 'family', 'same', 'class', 'Joanna', 'Drayton', 'family', 'still', 'fine', 'film', 'moving', 'moments', 'music', 'end', 'Thats', 'glory', 'Love', 'very', 'nostalgic', '50', 'jingles', 'super', 'sweet', 'hear', 'remarkably', 'touching', 'very', 'human', 'story', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'won', 'Oscar', 'film', 'when', 'compared', 'other', 'work', 'role', 'very', 'bland', 'basically', 'supportive', 'understanding', 'mother', 'pretensions', 'affected', 'dialogue', 'film', 'however', 'are', 'lead', 'believe', 'own', 'daughter', 'decided', 'marry', 'black', 'man', 'Native', 'American', 'man', 'matter', ""'d"", 'be', 'alright', 'Hepburn', 'classiness', 'patrician', 'facade', 'was', 'very', 'down-to-earth', 'woman', 'love', 'film', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'performance', 'worthy', 'Oscar', 'when', 'should', 'have', 'gone', 'Spencer', 'Tracey', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'who', 'really', 'carry', 'most', 'film', 'Watch', 'closely', 'Tracey', 'Poitier', 'are', 'other', 'different', 'skin', 'color', 'Katherine', 'Houghton', 'not', 'doing', 'anything', 'special', 'very', 'definative', 'preppy', 'high-class', 'girls', '50', 'film', 'radically', 'different', 'when', 'compare', 'more', 'modern', ""50'ish"", 'films', 'time', 'Graduate', 'came', 'out', 'time', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', 'haunting', 'notion', 'absence', 'God', 'triumphant', 'Satan', 'futuristic', 'abstract', 'Kubrick', 'film', '2001', 'A', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'film', 'still', 'good', 'however', 'lesson', 'loving', 'one', 'equals', 'irregardless', 'skin', 'color', 'class', 'even', 'not', 'issue', 'particular', 'film', 'political', 'affiliation', 'religious', 'differences', 'very', 'great', 'film', 'powerful', 'themes', 'love']",N/A
15997,A2RMH46E7TDI0C,0767821483,"Sean Aune ""Slacker""","[87, 100]","1967's Guess Who's Coming To Dinner probably raised more than a few eyebrows at the time of it's release.  Sadly though, if you can not put yourself in the mindset of that time, the potential emotional impact of the film will be lost on you.Set in the San Fransisco of the late 1960's, Guess Who's Coming To Dinner tells the story of Joanna Drayton (Katharine Houghton) bringing her boyfriend of a mere 10 days, Dr. John Wade Prentice (Sidney Poitier), home to meet her parents.  What the parents (played by Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn) don't know is A)she is coming home, B)that she has a boyfriend she is planning to marry C)that said boyfriend is African-American and that D)said boyfriend is 14 years older than she.Dr. Prentice informs Joey's parents of his intentions to marry their daughter, but also informs them he will not marry Joanna without their permission.  To further complicate matters though, they only have this one day to decide if they approve as he is due to leave for Geneva Switzerland for a job.  What ensues is a family's hopes and dreams for their daughter being analyzed and re-thought in the span of a mere few hours.  Trying to decide if their daughter's happiness should outweigh the inevitable hardships she will face in a relationship such as this.The film spares no time in setting up just how happy the new couple are, and also does not waste time in letting you know the difficulties an interracial couple will face at this time in American history.  Sadly though, it goes wrong in several other areas that are disturbing.  The cookie-cutter characters in this film abound.  The Irish Catholic Monsignor, the wise-to-the-world African American housekeeper and the busy-body friend of the Mother who has to be put in her place.  If you can look pass these worn out, two-dimensional characters though, there is a poignant story of how love truly should conquer all.Going back and watching a film that deals with race relations  from a different time period can, however,  be enlightening.  Not once do you hear the term ""African American"".  You do hear the ""N"" word once, but it is used by the housekeeper towards Dr. Prentice.  It is still shocking to hear it blurted out all of a sudden, but again, you have to remember the time frame the film was made in.This is a difficult review to write though.  This movie is flawed, but do you rate it based on its obvious film making flaws, or the merits of a story that needed to be told?  I think in the end you have to go with the story.  The story is basic, simple and timeless, don't judge a book by it's cover, and don't care what the rest of the world thinks.  For that, and its place in cinematic history, it deserves 4 stars.Sadly, the DVD though only gets 2 stars.  It does feature a gorgeous transfer of the film, and does offer both widescreen and full screen versions.  However, the lone extra is the original theatrical trailer.  Certainly there must have been something they could have included in the form of a commentary track for one of AFI's Top 100 Films Of The 20th Century.  A sad, little trailer is all it gets?  Pathetic.On a side note, this is also a sad movie to watch as you know Spencer Tracy passed away only 17 days after filming completed.  You can also see the early signs of Katherine Hepburn beginning to show signs of trembling that would later be so well known.  It was a fine film for both noteworthy actors.Four stars for the filmTwo stars for the DVD",4,"Flawed, but important film",1102982400,"12 14, 2004",2004,3474,"['1967', 'Guess', 'Who', 'Coming', 'Dinner', 'probably', 'raised', 'more', 'few', 'eyebrows', 'time', 'release', 'Sadly', 'can', 'not', 'put', 'mindset', 'time', 'potential', 'emotional', 'impact', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'lost', 'you.Set', 'San', 'Fransisco', 'late', '1960', 'Guess', 'Who', 'Coming', 'Dinner', 'story', 'Joanna', 'Drayton', 'Katharine', 'Houghton', 'bringing', 'boyfriend', 'mere', '10', 'days', 'Dr.', 'John', 'Wade', 'Prentice', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'home', 'meet', 'parents', 'What', 'parents', 'played', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'coming', 'home', 'B', 'boyfriend', 'planning', 'marry', 'C', 'said', 'boyfriend', 'African-American', 'D', 'said', 'boyfriend', '14', 'years', 'older', 'she.Dr', 'Prentice', 'Joey', 'parents', 'intentions', 'marry', 'daughter', 'also', 'will', 'not', 'marry', 'Joanna', 'permission', 'further', 'complicate', 'matters', 'only', 'have', 'one', 'day', 'decide', 'approve', 'due', 'leave', 'Geneva', 'Switzerland', 'job', 'What', 'family', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'daughter', 'being', 'analyzed', 're-thought', 'span', 'mere', 'few', 'hours', 'Trying', 'decide', 'daughter', 'happiness', 'should', 'outweigh', 'inevitable', 'hardships', 'will', 'face', 'relationship', 'such', 'this.The', 'film', 'time', 'setting', 'up', 'just', 'how', 'happy', 'new', 'couple', 'are', 'also', 'not', 'waste', 'time', 'letting', 'know', 'difficulties', 'interracial', 'couple', 'will', 'face', 'time', 'American', 'history', 'Sadly', 'wrong', 'several', 'other', 'areas', 'are', 'disturbing', 'cookie-cutter', 'characters', 'film', 'abound', 'Irish', 'Catholic', 'Monsignor', 'wise-to-the-world', 'African', 'American', 'housekeeper', 'busy-body', 'friend', 'Mother', 'who', 'be', 'put', 'place', 'can', 'look', 'worn', 'out', 'two-dimensional', 'characters', 'poignant', 'story', 'how', 'love', 'truly', 'should', 'conquer', 'all.Going', 'back', 'watching', 'film', 'race', 'relations', 'different', 'time', 'period', 'can', 'however', 'be', 'enlightening', 'Not', 'once', 'do', 'hear', 'term', 'African', 'American', 'do', 'hear', 'N', 'word', 'once', 'used', 'housekeeper', 'towards', 'Dr.', 'Prentice', 'still', 'shocking', 'hear', 'blurted', 'out', 'sudden', 'again', 'have', 'remember', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'in.This', 'difficult', 'review', 'write', 'though', 'movie', 'flawed', 'do', 'rate', 'based', 'obvious', 'film', 'making', 'flaws', 'merits', 'story', 'needed', 'be', 'told', 'think', 'end', 'have', 'go', 'story', 'story', 'basic', 'simple', 'timeless', 'do', ""n't"", 'judge', 'book', 'cover', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'rest', 'world', 'place', 'cinematic', 'history', '4', 'stars.Sadly', 'DVD', 'only', '2', 'stars', 'feature', 'gorgeous', 'transfer', 'film', 'offer', 'widescreen', 'full', 'screen', 'versions', 'However', 'lone', 'extra', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'Certainly', 'there', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'something', 'could', 'have', 'included', 'form', 'commentary', 'track', 'one', 'AFI', 'Top', '100', 'Films', '20th', 'Century', 'A', 'sad', 'little', 'trailer', 'Pathetic.On', 'side', 'note', 'also', 'sad', 'movie', 'watch', 'know', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'passed', 'away', 'only', '17', 'days', 'filming', 'completed', 'can', 'also', 'see', 'early', 'signs', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'beginning', 'show', 'signs', 'trembling', 'would', 'later', 'be', 'so', 'well', 'known', 'was', 'fine', 'film', 'noteworthy', 'actors.Four', 'stars', 'filmTwo', 'stars', 'DVD']",N/A
15998,A1XEFHQZP8Y35W,0767821483,Silver Screen,"[2, 2]","Guess Who's Coming to Dinner is worth viewing if only to see Spencer Tracy's last film role.  He plays Matt Drayton, a San Francisco attorney, married to Christina (Katharine Hepburn), an art gallery owner, with Katharine Houghton as their pretty daughter, Joanna.  Joanna has just returned home to inform her parents that while on vacation she has met Dr. John Prentiss (the wonderful Sidney Poitier), fallen in love with him and plans to be married.  So where's the problem?  Problem is that Matt, Christina and Joanna are white and John is African-American and this is 1967, when interracial relationships were not ""the norm"".  Never mind that they live in the liberal San Francisco and never mind that John is a doctor - - Matt at first is not happy with his daughter's choice . . . and neither is the Drakes' maid, who seems to find it insulting that a man of her own race has intended to marry the daughter of her white employers.  John's parents too are shocked with his choice and his father seems determined to talk him into marrying someone of his own race.  With the exception of Katharine Houghton, all the performances are strong, earnest and heartfelt.  While Houghton is not a poor actress, she seems so flighty, naive and almost tactless that you wonder what Dr. John Prentiss would see in her.  Another small fault in the film lies within the character of John himself.  Did the writers think that they had to make John a doctor in order to make him acceptable and worthy?  Why could he not be a postal employee like his father, but still the same warm, decent person that just happened to fall in love with a white woman?  In this respect, the film seems dated.  However, the film is saved by the three lead performances.  Sidney Poitier is strong, yet cool, as Dr. John Prentiss - - a man who wants to be recognized as just a man, not necessarily as a black man; Katharine Hepburn is warm, maternal and wanting to be happy that her daughter has found a man who loves her but also wanting to support her husband; Spencer Tracy's torn emotions over the man his daughter has chosen, whose only ""fault"" seems to be that the man is of a different race, is evident in his every scene.  Knowing that Tracy would die within weeks of the completion of this film makes this picture a gem.  The emotional scene at the end between him and Hepburn, in which real life and ""reel"" life surely intertwines, is worth sitting through the movie for.  A bit overdone, perhaps, but the real love of Tracy and Hepburn shines through.",3,Spencer Tracy's Last Role,1113350400,"04 13, 2005",2005,2530,"['Guess', 'Who', 'Coming', 'Dinner', 'worth', 'viewing', 'only', 'see', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'last', 'film', 'role', 'Matt', 'Drayton', 'San', 'Francisco', 'attorney', 'married', 'Christina', 'Katharine', 'Hepburn', 'art', 'gallery', 'owner', 'Katharine', 'Houghton', 'pretty', 'daughter', 'Joanna', 'Joanna', 'just', 'returned', 'home', 'inform', 'parents', 'while', 'vacation', 'met', 'Dr.', 'John', 'Prentiss', 'wonderful', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'fallen', 'love', 'plans', 'be', 'married', 'So', 'where', 'problem', 'Problem', 'Matt', 'Christina', 'Joanna', 'are', 'white', 'John', 'African-American', '1967', 'when', 'interracial', 'relationships', 'were', 'not', 'norm', 'Never', 'mind', 'live', 'liberal', 'San', 'Francisco', 'never', 'mind', 'John', 'doctor', 'Matt', 'first', 'not', 'happy', 'daughter', 'choice', 'Drakes', 'maid', 'who', 'find', 'insulting', 'man', 'own', 'race', 'intended', 'marry', 'daughter', 'white', 'employers', 'John', 'parents', 'too', 'are', 'shocked', 'choice', 'father', 'determined', 'talk', 'marrying', 'someone', 'own', 'race', 'exception', 'Katharine', 'Houghton', 'performances', 'are', 'strong', 'earnest', 'heartfelt', 'Houghton', 'not', 'poor', 'actress', 'so', 'flighty', 'naive', 'almost', 'tactless', 'wonder', 'what', 'Dr.', 'John', 'Prentiss', 'would', 'see', 'small', 'fault', 'film', 'character', 'John', 'Did', 'writers', 'think', 'had', 'make', 'John', 'doctor', 'order', 'make', 'acceptable', 'worthy', 'Why', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'postal', 'employee', 'father', 'still', 'same', 'warm', 'decent', 'person', 'just', 'happened', 'fall', 'love', 'white', 'woman', 'respect', 'film', 'dated', 'However', 'film', 'saved', 'three', 'lead', 'performances', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'strong', 'yet', 'cool', 'Dr.', 'John', 'Prentiss', 'man', 'who', 'be', 'recognized', 'just', 'man', 'not', 'necessarily', 'black', 'man', 'Katharine', 'Hepburn', 'warm', 'maternal', 'wanting', 'be', 'happy', 'daughter', 'found', 'man', 'who', 'also', 'wanting', 'support', 'husband', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'torn', 'emotions', 'man', 'daughter', 'chosen', 'only', 'fault', 'be', 'man', 'different', 'race', 'evident', 'scene', 'Knowing', 'Tracy', 'would', 'die', 'weeks', 'completion', 'film', 'picture', 'gem', 'emotional', 'scene', 'end', 'Hepburn', 'real', 'life', 'reel', 'life', 'surely', 'intertwines', 'worth', 'sitting', 'movie', 'bit', 'overdone', 'perhaps', 'real', 'love', 'Tracy', 'Hepburn', 'shines']",N/A

When I saw the 40th Anniversary copy at Walmart, I bought it to remember the memories of this film. My mom and I still watch this film and analyze it from head to toe. When I was younger, I had no tolerance for Spencer Tracy's role, but as I grew older and became a mother myself(two daughters at that), I had to say that I understood his reluctance in giving approval and blessing. It is one thing to bring home someone you may accept, but in these days, things have definitely changed. It could be someone of another color, one of the same sex, and how do you go about that? For one thing, I wasn't down with the daughter wanting approval and then rushing off to be with this man(Sidney or no)to me, I didn't see the rush. If he loved her today, he would love her tommorrow.

African-Americans were protected by the law, but still were not respected by everyone, as Stanley Kramer showed in this movie about a debate between two families over an inter-racial marriage. His film is a message that, in such a case, it shouldn't matter as to what color they are but as to how much they love another.While an overall good movie, some of its ideas have dated. First off, Sidney Poitier's character, in order to be worthy of the white girl (Katharine Houghton) has to be wealthy and a doctor who happens to work in Hawaii. Second, the subject of interracial marriage, while still not accepted by some, has become somewhat common in our society. If such a movie were made nowadays, it would probably deal with the subject of homosexual marriage.Spencer Tracy is dominant as usual in this picture. For one thing, he gets reunited with co-star Katharine Hepburn for the first time since the late `50's. And he is in his first major film in about 3 or 4 years. Finally, he gives everything he has because he didn't have much left to live. Ill during the production, he died just days after completion. Both Tracy and Hepburn got Oscar nominations, with Kate emerging victorious (Though some might say voters felt sympathetic for her following Spence's loss). It is surprising that Poitier, who had a tremendous year in '67 (In addition to this, there was Best Picture winner ""In The Heat of the Night"") was not nominated at all for this or any other film that year. While I can't compare it to his other work (Since I haven't seen any other of his movies), I think he was very good in the role.""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"", while a bit aged, is still recommended watching. Not just to see how our ideals have changed since it was first released, but because some themes shown here may still have relevance (Homosexual and interracial marriage can be compared and both are subjects much debated about). Watch it also for Spencer Tracy, who is in a moving moment you could easily miss if you don't know its importance. It is during the last scene. Spence is giving a speech about why Houghton and Poitier should get married. The camera takes a look at Hepburn's face. She is misty eyed, not just because of the words he is saying, but because she knew this would be Tracy's last film and thus the last time she would be able to star with him. Now the usage of the song ""The Story of Love"" seems most fitting...",4,A good message movie because it still has some relevance.,1007164800,"12 1, 2001",2001,2527,"['When', 'was', 'made', '1967', 'Guess', 'Who', 's', 'Coming', 'Dinner', 'reflected', 'changing', 'times', 'America', 'African-Americans', 'were', 'protected', 'law', 'still', 'were', 'not', 'respected', 'everyone', 'Stanley', 'Kramer', 'showed', 'movie', 'debate', 'two', 'families', 'inter-racial', 'marriage', 'film', 'message', 'case', 'should', ""n't"", 'matter', 'what', 'color', 'are', 'how', 'much', 'love', 'overall', 'good', 'movie', 'ideas', 'have', 'dated', 'First', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'character', 'order', 'be', 'worthy', 'white', 'girl', 'Katharine', 'Houghton', 'be', 'wealthy', 'doctor', 'who', 'work', 'Hawaii', 'Second', 'subject', 'interracial', 'marriage', 'still', 'not', 'accepted', 'become', 'somewhat', 'common', 'society', 'such', 'movie', 'were', 'made', 'nowadays', 'would', 'probably', 'deal', 'subject', 'homosexual', 'marriage.Spencer', 'Tracy', 'dominant', 'usual', 'picture', 'one', 'thing', 'reunited', 'co-star', 'Katharine', 'Hepburn', 'first', 'time', 'late', '50', 'first', 'major', 'film', 'about', '3', '4', 'years', 'Finally', 'everything', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'left', 'live', 'Ill', 'production', 'died', 'just', 'days', 'completion', 'Tracy', 'Hepburn', 'got', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'Kate', 'emerging', 'victorious', 'might', 'say', 'voters', 'felt', 'sympathetic', 'following', 'Spence', 'loss', 'surprising', 'Poitier', 'who', 'had', 'tremendous', 'year', ""'67"", 'addition', 'was', 'Best', 'Picture', 'winner', 'Heat', 'Night', 'was', 'not', 'nominated', 'other', 'film', 'year', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'other', 'work', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'other', 'movies', 'think', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'role', 'Guess', 'Who', 'Coming', 'Dinner', 'bit', 'aged', 'still', 'recommended', 'watching', 'Not', 'just', 'see', 'how', 'ideals', 'have', 'changed', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'themes', 'shown', 'here', 'may', 'still', 'have', 'relevance', 'Homosexual', 'interracial', 'marriage', 'can', 'be', 'compared', 'are', 'subjects', 'much', 'debated', 'Watch', 'also', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'who', 'moving', 'moment', 'could', 'easily', 'miss', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'importance', 'last', 'scene', 'Spence', 'giving', 'speech', 'why', 'Houghton', 'Poitier', 'should', 'get', 'married', 'camera', 'look', 'Hepburn', 'face', 'misty', 'eyed', 'not', 'just', 'words', 'saying', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'Tracy', 'last', 'film', 'thus', 'last', 'time', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'star', 'Now', 'usage', 'song', 'Story', 'Love', 'most', 'fitting']",N/A
16003,AHJ185Q3PPH5F,0767821483,"William Fredrick Cooper ""ESSENCE BESTSELLING ...","[4, 6]","As a nationally published author, I understand that quality is lacking in today's artistic efforts. Most advocate the BIG-BANG Theory, full of sound and fury, but the significance of things weighs little on the minds of many.As a study to my novel THERE'S ALWAYS A REASON, I wanted to examine the twists and turns and depths of love as it pertained to the ""perfectly imperfect"" union of Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. For that reason, I decided to watch ALL THEIR FILMS film in sequence, and study their unique chemistry.  GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER, their last effort made with a ""race against time"" mindset due to Spencer Tracy's health, blew me away with its depth.The story, obvious to us all after almost forty years, was the first of its kind to tackle interracial relations. Katherine Houghton sparkled as the lively optimistic Joey Drayton. Her innocence infectious, her tenacity as well as energy and understated strength illuminated the screen. Young love oozed from her pores.As does Sidney Poitier. In a dramatic role as a Joey's successful black beau, I couldn't help think of the tension, plus relationship issues I encountered some twenty years after this project was made when dating a white woman, as well as the negative looks given by people six years into the twenty-first century, like it's still taboo. Portraying his role with great intensity, his worthy performance is one of his very best. That confrontational scene with Roy Glenn was breathtaking in its power.Supporting efforts by Isabel Sanford (The Jefferson's Fame) and Beau Richards (That passionate, ""What Happens When Men Grow Old"" speech was the perfect set-up for...) were astoundingly exceptional in their range. Sanford, playing the cynical maid, was humorous in her attack mode, while Richards nearly steals the show in the too few minutes she graced the scene.I cannot begin to describe what I felt, watching Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy in their roles as Christina and Matt Drayton. Surrealism at its finest, truth met fiction in an emotional way. From Spencer's gaze of love in 1942's WOMAN OF THE YEAR after he saw Kate fiddling with her stockings to the very last scene of his life, you could feel the love and devotion between the two. That last look into Kate's teary eyes brought the house down. Remember when they were both in the car, at the ice cream parlor, and she uttered the lines which referred to her taking care of him. If You Read 'An Affair To Remember"", You'll see the validity in the statement.I can only imagine the emotions that ran through both of them, as they knew their imperfect yet perfect relationship was drawing to a close. Their love for each other was evident throughout, and, in this viewers mind, stole the movie. That climatic speech Spencer Tracy gave at movies end moved me to tears. I can understand why Katherine said that she could never watch that movie - for it was a public goodbye. The sand in the hourglass near empty: twelve days after the final take, he was gone. That speech, done in one take was a not only the close of an era of when actors really acted, but more so was a fitting tribute to their love: the only thing that mattered between Spence and Kate was what they felt, and how they felt for each other. That meant everything to those two, as well as all that witnessed their unique union.That indeed, is the story of love.",5,That's The Story Of Love,1187568000,"08 20, 2007",2007,3387,"['nationally', 'published', 'author', 'understand', 'quality', 'lacking', 'today', 'artistic', 'efforts', 'Most', 'advocate', 'BIG-BANG', 'Theory', 'full', 'sound', 'fury', 'significance', 'things', 'little', 'minds', 'many.As', 'study', 'novel', 'THERE', 'ALWAYS', 'A', 'REASON', 'wanted', 'examine', 'twists', 'turns', 'depths', 'love', 'pertained', 'perfectly', 'imperfect', 'union', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'Katharine', 'Hepburn', 'reason', 'decided', 'watch', 'THEIR', 'FILMS', 'film', 'sequence', 'study', 'unique', 'chemistry', 'GUESS', 'WHO', 'COMING', 'TO', 'DINNER', 'last', 'effort', 'made', 'race', 'time', 'mindset', 'due', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'health', 'blew', 'away', 'depth.The', 'story', 'obvious', 'almost', 'forty', 'years', 'was', 'first', 'kind', 'tackle', 'interracial', 'relations', 'Katherine', 'Houghton', 'sparkled', 'lively', 'optimistic', 'Joey', 'Drayton', 'innocence', 'infectious', 'tenacity', 'as', 'well', 'energy', 'understated', 'strength', 'illuminated', 'screen', 'Young', 'love', 'oozed', 'pores.As', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'dramatic', 'role', 'Joey', 'successful', 'black', 'beau', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'tension', 'relationship', 'issues', 'encountered', 'twenty', 'years', 'project', 'was', 'made', 'when', 'dating', 'white', 'woman', 'as', 'well', 'negative', 'looks', 'given', 'people', 'six', 'years', 'twenty-first', 'century', 'still', 'taboo', 'Portraying', 'role', 'great', 'intensity', 'worthy', 'performance', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'confrontational', 'scene', 'Roy', 'Glenn', 'was', 'breathtaking', 'power.Supporting', 'efforts', 'Isabel', 'Sanford', 'Jefferson', 'Fame', 'Beau', 'Richards', 'passionate', 'What', 'When', 'Men', 'Grow', 'Old', 'speech', 'was', 'perfect', 'set-up', 'were', 'astoundingly', 'exceptional', 'range', 'Sanford', 'playing', 'cynical', 'maid', 'was', 'humorous', 'attack', 'mode', 'Richards', 'nearly', 'steals', 'show', 'too', 'few', 'minutes', 'graced', 'scene.I', 'can', 'not', 'begin', 'describe', 'what', 'felt', 'watching', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'roles', 'Christina', 'Matt', 'Drayton', 'Surrealism', 'finest', 'truth', 'met', 'fiction', 'emotional', 'way', 'Spencer', 'gaze', 'love', '1942', 'WOMAN', 'THE', 'YEAR', 'saw', 'Kate', 'fiddling', 'stockings', 'very', 'last', 'scene', 'life', 'could', 'feel', 'love', 'devotion', 'two', 'last', 'look', 'Kate', 'teary', 'eyes', 'brought', 'house', 'down', 'Remember', 'when', 'were', 'car', 'ice', 'cream', 'parlor', 'uttered', 'lines', 'referred', 'taking', 'care', 'Read', 'Affair', 'Remember', ""'ll"", 'see', 'validity', 'statement.I', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'emotions', 'ran', 'knew', 'imperfect', 'yet', 'perfect', 'relationship', 'was', 'drawing', 'close', 'love', 'other', 'was', 'evident', 'viewers', 'mind', 'stole', 'movie', 'climatic', 'speech', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'gave', 'movies', 'end', 'moved', 'tears', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'Katherine', 'said', 'could', 'never', 'watch', 'movie', 'was', 'public', 'goodbye', 'sand', 'hourglass', 'empty', 'twelve', 'days', 'final', 'take', 'was', 'gone', 'speech', 'done', 'one', 'take', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'close', 'era', 'when', 'actors', 'really', 'acted', 'more', 'so', 'was', 'fitting', 'tribute', 'love', 'only', 'thing', 'mattered', 'Spence', 'Kate', 'was', 'what', 'felt', 'how', 'felt', 'other', 'meant', 'everything', 'two', 'as', 'well', 'witnessed', 'unique', 'indeed', 'story', 'love']",N/A
