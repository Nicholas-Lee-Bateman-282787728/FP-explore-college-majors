No one will watch it with me and that is ok.It is a spoof of ww 2 occupied france. The jokes are broad and the stereotypes are over the top but I don't care it is funny in the silliest way. Everybody in france seems to want to get down rene's pants. ( Which is so ludricrus and hilarious because rene is bald, chubby and kinda whiney.Even a certian german officer who acts so gay you wonder if it is a put on to get ahead constantly comes onto him. Some of the gags get old like the bad  dressing in drag, but most do not.
