Most horror movies rely on jump scare but what makes a perfect horror is the good story that puts everything together. This movie has all of that.This movie contains good scary parts. The fact that little girls are involved always make the movie scarier. There are some minor goofs but nothing that would spoil the bigger picture. The creators did an amazing job by making the movie scary enough to keep you entertained without overwhelming you.

I get that two daughters lost their parents, lived alone in a house in the woods for 5 years, developed wild instincts, and had to learn to defend themselves from danger before being found, and I understand that this is a horror movie so for the sake of telling a frightening storyline, some kind of supernatural force had to be included to make the girls act differently from the average person secluded away for many years (such as the Exorcist example I mention above which is used here on quite a few occasions) and of course we know the uncle and his rock star girlfriend has to try and raise the girls the best they can (even though the girlfriend is less than interested in raising kids, and only doing so for the purpose of supporting her partner).  I didn't really quite understand why they had to live in a house picked out for them, though.  If they didn't live in this specific house, they wouldn't be able to raise the girls.  I can't speak from experience, but this doesn't seem realistic to me.  Even the girls friend comments that it's weird.All this stuff makes sense to me, but what I don't understand is all the stuff pertaining to the Mama entity other than she developed a trust with the girls while they were secluded away and living on their own, and that she can control them through fear and supernatural ways.  The girls understand Mama's behavior as well as Mama knows their behavior.  They've developed an unbreakable bond I guess you could say.  What really frightens me is when you see the Mama demon standing quietly in the background and then she suddenly RUNS or floats directly in front of the camera!  This movie works amazingly well combining both psychological and jump scares.  You obviously jump when Mama suddenly darts across the room, but it's really mind-twisting when you see what Mama's face looks like and the way she moves on the walls and inside the floorboards.Also, the dream portion of the storyline that the rockstar woman has with the stabbed nuns and the screaming baby... I can't recall the last time such a realistic portrayal of a dream actually occurred in a movie before, if ever.  This is *exactly* how I dream, with one scene immediately shifting somewhere else in the blink of an eye that feels like a perfectly natural transition even though it's not.  In this case, a woman appearing in church and then suddenly appearing outside holding and running away with a baby in her arms.  The exceptionally bright background while all this is going on is incredibly realistic and reminiscent of a dream as well because in dreamland, everything looks brighter (or darker, depending on the cicumstances) than in reality.  Excellent job by the people who created this segment!  Now do I know what this segment actually means pertaining to the storyline?  Not really.  I have my ideas however.While quite often it's understandable to poke fun at Hollywood's exaggerated and unsatisfying attempts at movie writing these days (especially when it concerns horror) Mama is a movie that actually gets it right mostly because the film executes in all the key areas.  It has atmosphere, wonderful timing, children often moving awkwardly in dark hallways effectively sending chills through your spine, the Mama character never appearing while the parents are around for quite a bit of the storytelling during the first half, and most importantly, the Mama character herself is EXTREMELY frightening due to special effects that can only be described as otherworldly and highly unusual.  These are the kind of special effects that remind viewers what it is they love about scary houses.  While the lack of compassion between the rockstar girlfriend and the two sisters may be a sign of bad acting, and even though I may have misunderstood Mama's decisions (without spoiling it) during the final 20 minutes, it doesn't change the enjoyment, fear or fascination I felt leading up to that point so I must give in and award the film 5 stars.  It really left me satisfied.  Hollywood got it right for once!",5,don't touch the moth hole,1382227200,"10 20, 2013",2013,4721,"['Let', 'ask', 'question', 'Are', 'somebody', 'who', 'freakiest', 'scene', 'Exorcist', 'when', 'little', 'girl', 'mother', 'walking', 'down', 'stairs', 'backwards', 'spider', 'up', 'floor', 'so', 'Mama', '*certainly*', 'movie', 'scariest', 'scene', ""'ve"", 'EVER', 'witnessed', 'horror', 'movie', 'timing', 'scary', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'also', 'just', 'idea', 'girl', 'darting', 'down', 'stairs', 'such', 'awkward', 'way', 'memorable', 'moment', 'scary', 'movie', 'writing', 'there', 'Mama', 'basically', 'same', 'way.However', 'said', 'honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'storyline', 'pertaining', 'Mama', 'get', 'two', 'daughters', 'lost', 'parents', 'lived', 'alone', 'house', 'woods', '5', 'years', 'developed', 'wild', 'instincts', 'had', 'learn', 'defend', 'danger', 'being', 'found', 'understand', 'horror', 'movie', 'so', 'sake', 'telling', 'frightening', 'storyline', 'kind', 'supernatural', 'force', 'had', 'be', 'included', 'make', 'girls', 'act', 'differently', 'average', 'person', 'secluded', 'away', 'many', 'years', 'such', 'Exorcist', 'example', 'mention', 'used', 'here', 'quite', 'few', 'occasions', 'course', 'know', 'uncle', 'rock', 'star', 'girlfriend', 'try', 'raise', 'girls', 'best', 'can', 'even', 'girlfriend', 'less', 'interested', 'raising', 'kids', 'only', 'doing', 'so', 'purpose', 'supporting', 'partner', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'quite', 'understand', 'why', 'had', 'live', 'house', 'picked', 'out', 'though', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'specific', 'house', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'raise', 'girls', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'experience', ""n't"", 'seem', 'realistic', 'Even', 'girls', 'friend', 'comments', 'stuff', 'sense', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'stuff', 'pertaining', 'Mama', 'entity', 'other', 'developed', 'trust', 'girls', 'were', 'secluded', 'away', 'living', 'own', 'can', 'control', 'fear', 'supernatural', 'ways', 'girls', 'understand', 'Mama', 'behavior', 'as', 'well', 'Mama', 'behavior', ""'ve"", 'developed', 'unbreakable', 'bond', 'guess', 'could', 'say', 'What', 'really', 'when', 'see', 'Mama', 'demon', 'standing', 'quietly', 'background', 'then', 'suddenly', 'RUNS', 'floats', 'directly', 'front', 'camera', 'movie', 'amazingly', 'well', 'combining', 'psychological', 'jump', 'scares', 'obviously', 'jump', 'when', 'Mama', 'suddenly', 'room', 'really', 'mind-twisting', 'when', 'see', 'what', 'Mama', 'face', 'way', 'walls', 'floorboards.Also', 'dream', 'portion', 'storyline', 'rockstar', 'woman', 'stabbed', 'nuns', 'screaming', 'baby', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'last', 'time', 'such', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'dream', 'actually', 'occurred', 'movie', 'ever', '*exactly*', 'how', 'dream', 'one', 'scene', 'immediately', 'shifting', 'somewhere', 'else', 'blink', 'eye', 'perfectly', 'natural', 'transition', 'even', 'not', 'case', 'woman', 'appearing', 'church', 'then', 'suddenly', 'appearing', 'holding', 'running', 'away', 'baby', 'arms', 'exceptionally', 'bright', 'background', 'going', 'incredibly', 'realistic', 'reminiscent', 'dream', 'as', 'well', 'dreamland', 'everything', 'looks', 'brighter', 'darker', 'depending', 'cicumstances', 'reality', 'Excellent', 'job', 'people', 'who', 'created', 'segment', 'Now', 'do', 'know', 'what', 'segment', 'actually', 'pertaining', 'storyline', 'Not', 'really', 'have', 'ideas', 'however.While', 'quite', 'often', 'understandable', 'poke', 'fun', 'Hollywood', 'exaggerated', 'unsatisfying', 'attempts', 'movie', 'writing', 'days', 'especially', 'when', 'horror', 'Mama', 'movie', 'actually', 'right', 'mostly', 'film', 'key', 'areas', 'atmosphere', 'wonderful', 'timing', 'children', 'often', 'moving', 'awkwardly', 'dark', 'hallways', 'effectively', 'sending', 'chills', 'spine', 'Mama', 'character', 'never', 'appearing', 'parents', 'are', 'quite', 'bit', 'storytelling', 'first', 'half', 'most', 'importantly', 'Mama', 'character', 'EXTREMELY', 'frightening', 'due', 'special', 'effects', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'otherworldly', 'highly', 'unusual', 'are', 'kind', 'special', 'effects', 'remind', 'viewers', 'what', 'love', 'scary', 'houses', 'lack', 'compassion', 'rockstar', 'girlfriend', 'two', 'sisters', 'may', 'be', 'sign', 'bad', 'acting', 'even', 'may', 'have', 'misunderstood', 'Mama', 'decisions', 'spoiling', 'final', '20', 'minutes', ""n't"", 'change', 'enjoyment', 'fear', 'fascination', 'felt', 'leading', 'up', 'point', 'so', 'must', 'give', 'award', 'film', '5', 'stars', 'really', 'left', 'satisfied', 'Hollywood', 'got', 'right', 'once']",N/A

PG-13 or not, I made sure to get myself to the theater to see and support this and I wasn't at all disappointed. MAMA had an interesting story, impressive acting and a visually striking supernatural antagonist. There were definitely elements of Asian horror on display in this film, though MAMA relies a bit too much on CG. Thankfully the CG was animated relatively well so if you're willing to look beyond that and allow yourself to be swept up in the tension, MAMA is effective.Sure, it won't be for everybody, and for fans of films like INSIDIOUS, SINISTER and THE CONJURING it may come off a bit lightweight but it was entertaining and, in my opinion, worth checking out.

1611607,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B00AIBZLVY,California Dreaming,"[0, 0]","What do you get if you take a Grimm's Fairy Tale, ""The Woman in Black,"" and throw in a little bit of ""Sophie's Choice""?  Well, ""Mama"" I guess, although I believe that in this case, the whole is less than the sum of its parts.And this is too bad, considering that this film has such a strong start.  I really liked the cinematography, I really liked the CGI, and the color palette that the director chose fit the mood perfectly.  The story seemed to have so much promise, but it just never quite came together for me, and somewhere near the beginning of the third act I started looking at my watch.  Well, that would be if I wore one, I suppose.I thought that ""The Woman in Black"" was just a much stronger film.  Danielle Radcliffe gave perhaps his best performance there -- yes, surely better than ""Harry Potter"" although that fantasy series was good for the genre -- and I just felt that that film had a bit more believability to me.  Sure, the plots in both films require the viewer to suspend belief.  But ""Mama"" seemingly requires the viewer to take a huge leap of faith (which you might argue is somewhat fitting once you know the plot), and ultimately, I don't believe that there is enough of a payoff for that leap.I thought that Jessica Chastain was tremendous in ""Zero Dark Thirty"" and ""The Tree of Life,"" and she's almost unrecognizable here at the beginning, although that's not necessarily a bad thing.  I knew she was in the film, but I did a double and triple take trying to recognize her, as she plays a role that is so different from what I've seen her in before.  I would say that she does another fine job -- not as good as those other roles, however, although to be fair she had less to work with here -- but she's not enough to save this near miss.Just by the numbers, I saw that the critics liked this film more than the average viewer.  On this one, I think that the critics perhaps gave it a bit of a pass.

1611608,AAB0BPNWDIOXJ,B00AIBZLVY,Camazotz,"[2, 5]","I have had some pretty cool dreams in my life, quite a few of them kinda scary in this indefinable ""...ya' hadta be there..."" way. I found a couple of the dreams I have had to be interesting and/or creepy enough to merit artistic attention. Perhaps a painting would suffice. Or a bit of graphic design. Maybe a short story or a short film. If I had the time, energy and interest, I could even turn some of these dreams into full-length films or a novel. Oh man, but that would call for a lot of work, or balls of steel, or--worse--both. I'd have to take this isolated concept, whose life began as a psychological and emotional island--removed, by definition, from anything resembling a coherent narrative--and place it within one that's tight enough, but odd enough, to do no insult to the small, original vision from which it sprang. I suspect that the construction of Andy Muschietti's MAMA rested on the same kind of compelling but flimsy foundation.It's my understanding that Muschietti made a short film about a woman who was chasing a couple of kids around a dilapidated house, the children all the while referring to this terrifying visage as ""mama"" while alternating between placating the woman and trying to escape from her. I guess the movie was pretty damned scary in an archetypal, hard to define way. It got the attention of Guillermo Del Toro, who thought there was enough raw horror in the short to develop it into a two-hour (give or take) movie.I can't disagree with Del Toro's assessment. I'm sure that what Muschietti made originally was very scary indeed. It sounds like it would make me crap my pants, and there are moments in MAMA that provide some real chills [the subtle effects used in making the girls appear completely wild, a few scenes where the children are playing with an implied--but obscured--MAMA]. But those occasions--like a cool, scary dream--stand completely apart from an otherwise tired plot line. You could isolate every genuinely alarming incident in MAMA, make a video with just those scenes, and end up with a far more disturbing film than what was released.The rest of MAMA (i.e. the boring parts) is nothing but a typical haunting story as generated by The Script-O-Matic 3000. A young woman (Chastain), compelling in that she's uninterested in having children with her husband/lover (Waldau), ends up forced by nasty circumstances into playing house with two of his nieces. The nieces are severely disturbed after having spent a few years living in the woods with the force/spirit known as MAMA. Bit by bit, the kids are socialized (one decidedly faster than the other) and the once-compelling young woman doing the lion's share of the rearing comes to feel an enduring and utterly dull love for them, and she's determined to protect both of the kids from the MAMA force that won't quite let them go. This is accomplished, of course, by gumshoeing her way through the mystery of why MAMA is such a pain in the butt. Once the mystery is solved--through means that are almost entirely daft--there is a final battle between the over-the-top, spirit MAMA and the now flat-as-wet-flint, suburban MAMA. The kid that's less socialized (and, frankly, more interesting) than her sister is sacrificed. Of course. The snore-inducing dinks that decide they don't want to be involved with anything more supernatural than the local Crate & Barrel survive. The end.It's a shame, really. I could see a lot of possibility during certain sequences of this film, and in certain characters. I wish Chastain--the human MAMA--could have stayed a strong and independent force, rather than knuckling under to the same worn-out Hollywood lecture about the joys of motherhood and servitude. I wish that the older child weren't so easily reigned in, so ready to wash off all of the hell that she'd endured because getting warm-fuzzies from Chastain just made all of her pain go poof! I wish that Waldau--Chastain's lover--would have had more screen time. God knows, he's charismatic and good looking enough to deserve it.MAMA could have been a force to reckon with, but Muschietti needs more confidence in his own vision. He needs to be able to let his dreams and ideas stand on their own, or he needs to take a page from Del Toro's playbook and let the dark side of the force have a win once in a while. Those kinds of stories are captivating. The ones where the good guys' prize for going through hell is a table at a local food court where they'll discuss Tiffany's soccer schedule, play dates, and honor roll standing while completely glossing over her hellish background just aren't.2.5 Stars",2,"There's something here, there just needs to be more of it...(SPOILERS)",1369526400,"05 26, 2013",2013,4618,"['have', 'had', 'pretty',

Characters that you grow to like as they evolve and are portrayed with good acting.

Most importantly subtle escalation in the scares that mixed both psychological and jump-out-at-you-thrills.  I was not only rooting for our family but the ghost as well, in a looking forward to her redemption sort of way.  Really for most of the film I was expecting to write a four or five star review.

MAMA is a chilling and frightful ghost story whose most horrific moments come out of the children's eerie performances, rather than the sudden appearances of the spindly apparition. Victoria and Lilly have regressed in to an animal-like state, which causes them to run around on all fours and lash out aggressively. Their discovery within the dilapidated cabin makes for a truly unnerving experience. Director Andr&eacute;s Muschietti drowns each scene with oppressive feelings of tension and dread, and creates a number of disturbing images along the way. Where he falters most is in the storytelling, itself. MAMA is a simple rehash of so many other similar tales of ghostly revenge, with a familiar structure that rarely deviates from the status quo. The film's subtler moments are infinitely more effective than the outright shocks, due to the heavy reliance on computerized imaging that dispels all feelings of suspended disbelief.

1611622,A30WXSK6N4J0CZ,B00AIBZLVY,Christian R. Unger,"[1, 1]","Mama is a unique horror film, because unlike most horror flicks that come to mind like Resident Evil this doesn't so much try to frighten you as disturb. Unlike Nightmare on Elm Street and it's ilk, it's not a slasher that scares you with disturbing violence, and unlike Cabin in the Woods (also very worth a watch) it doesn't try to be unique, it just is (especially in an American market, not so much in European and Asian). What makes it so unique to my experience is that its not a horror movie for horror's sake, but rather the horror is a vehicle to tell a tale of a tragedy, and although the tragedy is there, the focus here is not on that so much as the result of it.So, basically we have a tragic event, which interacts with another tragic event (which if it were played out would be a tragedy) and what do tragic events lead to? Lack of resolution and thus ghosts. Now, I'm a little conflicted in saying ""ghost"" because you're never told that's what is going on and you might substitute in another creature of sorts, because it doesn't quite follow the normal ghost stereo type with some things that head into the demon, though that doesn't line up with the back story, so I'll just simplify and say ""ghost"". And if you worry I've given too much away, we're about five minutes into the film.Mama in some ways is very open about what is going on with the audience and in others it ... almost hides things. It also sort of twists around the events that (while maybe not altering the predictability of the end game) make it an interesting ride. It's not cluttered or sloppy or badly structured, in fact it's very tidy, tight, well thought out. It just isn't going to be quite what you expect it and that is why it's probably getting a fair few good reviews.Okay, so story is interesting and different. Acting, because it relies so heavily on the two girls, is a little bit strained: there is not enough nuance in emotions, and many feel like over reactions. One could dismiss that as ""we don't know what they've been through"" and so maybe its justified. Actually talking about what they've been through, between act 1 (the setup) and act 2 (the main events) there is a five year period, which is where the intro credits roll. And in the back ground are like child drawings of what they go through whilst they are lost in the woods with their ""Mama"". This is really well done, and although it doesn't paint a very complete picture, it is a really well done and used device.The acting on behalf of the adults is ... okay. None of the actors I would call massive, that's not to say they haven't been in some good stuff, but on the whole ... I'd say it is passable. The important elements are there and Jessica Castain does carry the important role of ""the scared adult"" very well. Actually her emotional development and the character she portrays are excellent. But all the characters have this withdrawn feel (add to that the generally grey colour tones for weather and backdrop) and its clear this movie is not about the actors but the story. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau is also decent, and I loved that he is in there in a double role, and very subtle in how he portrays two brothers, but given his character is away for most of the film, he isn't that important.Direction: the way the story is combined together with the direction (i.e.: how the scenes are put together) is fantastic. ConsiderParanormal Activitywhere the premise was fresh, the tension of looking for what's happening is awesome. Mama plays this very differently, you never guess if it means to show you something and there is a lot of subtlety, but also a lot of excellence in how the shots are set up. If you want a case study of how to shoot a film where the audience has a different set of information to the characters, and neither knows what is going to happen, look no further: Mama does this well. It is easily one of the tensest films and easily compares toSplicebut what it did with mostly soundtrack and setting, this one does with visuals and soundtrack. It is superb.Soundtrack and visual design are both good. Soundtrack is arguably cliched but it works, and even though there were some instances where I considered that every work that wants to build tension uses the same technique (and it stands out) what happens next puts that thought out of my mind, and its easily forgotten again. Visual design, as mentioned above, is largely grey and dark, there will be instances where it is not and it works well on a subconscious level, again this isn't complex stuff but it works really well.So in conclusion, I've seen a couple of reviews saying this is derivative, and yeah ... maybe it is, but this isn't something that comes up that often that you go ""oh great, another kids grow up in the wild watched over by a super natural being that can't let go when they are 'rescued' flick"". And while that is the premise there is a lot to this that makes it excellent. Basically, it knows what it is, and tries to be the best version of what that can be. However, it isn't quite what you think, and once you think back over it you'll see not only how truly sad the events were really where on the spectrum the ending falls. This is a movie that will probably stick with you for a little while, which in today's market, is rare.",4,"A truly tragic story, with very strong horror elements masterfully put

But it's the creepiness and freakiness of the little girls -- deserted in a cabin in the woods for years when one was pre-k age and the other just a baby -- that give this movie its edge.  Aside from that aspect of the plot, all that's really important, and is made clear from the onset, is that Jessica Chastain's character is not kid-friendly; she doesn't want kids nor is her lifestyle conducive to mothering.  Yet because she loves her boyfriend, she agrees to help him care for his two nieces, who are definitely not like other little girls, and were for years raised by a ""mother"" with a back story that's led to some serious attachment issues.  In terms of the girls' birth parents -- their father killed their mother and it's his fault that they ended up in that cabin.  These kids could definitely use some nurturing.Much like in a good number of horror movies, some of what happens doesn't makes sense, or remains unexplained because there's no good explanation.  Or is so painfully obvious that you keep expecting a twist that never comes.  But what redeems this particular horror movie from all of that is 1) how absolutely freaky it is at times, and 2) its fairly nuanced commentary on family and parenting.I saw the movie in a theatre and am not sure how well the special effects will play out on a small screen, and it is pretty reliant on them for scares.  Still, although it's not on par with ""The Ring"" (another movie that explores both the dark and virtuous side of parent/child relationships and is populated by a horrifying little girl), ""Mama"" gets points for trying to update some pretty tired conventions of the genre -- and because those little girls are just so freaky.

1611626,A1B5Y34G3GJDJ1,B00AIBZLVY,C. Kragel,"[3, 4]","Mama is a modern ghost tale that tells the story of two girls lost in the woods for five years, and are somehow taken care of by a mysterious force. From the start, the movie showed great potential. We are given a feasible situation where the girls are stranded in an abandoned home, a suitable demonstration where some new parents can step in, and a premise for a hopefully decent movie. Also, the way the girls de-evolve shortly into the movie to quadrapedal deranged social lunatics is an excellent effect and addition to the story. Very creepy.Having said all this, I feel the movie falls a little short about half way in. Firstly, most of the scares are nothing but cheap jumps, loud noises, and eerie faces portruding from the darkness to try and make you jump in your seat. There really is not an imminent sense of danger throughout as the ghost simply plays with the girls and keeps them company. The first person harmed seems more a mishap than a malicious attempt to kill.Secondly, the ending seemed almost silly. (Spoiler) We are submitted for our viewing pleasure to an almost reenactment of the ghost's past to where she seemingly involuntarily forced herself and her child over a cliff side, but this time with a new companion, the little girl throughout. Was this necessary for some ritual to stop the ghost from harming anyone else? I simply did not see the relevance, besides what I have just given.Lastly, whenever someone goes by themselves into a dark house in the middle of the woods in the pitch black of night, in active pursuit of a ghost mind you, I seem to emotionally forego any caring for their death. In other words, if the person dies, I don't care because nobody would right do that in real life who wasn't suicidal or just plain stupid. This seemed to be a cheaply played scare, that did not really seem all that scary. It was more predictable than anything. Like most of the movie.All in all, I was fairly disappointed by this movie, for the reasons listed above as well as others. I felt it to be extremely predictable and full of cheap 'make you jump' scenes and little intact horror. The ghost, while eerie and well produced, did little to make me care for her plight or backstory, other than a means of ending the movie. I would say watch this movie if you have a couple hours to burn on a rainy day with possibly nothing else to do. Maybe you'll like it, but I would definitively say that there are better horror/ ghost stories out there.",2,"A mediocre, predictable ghost ghost tale that did not match its potential",1369353600,"05 24, 2013",2013,2476,"['Mama', 'modern', 'ghost', 'tale', 'story', 'two', 'girls', 'lost', 'woods', 'five', 'years', 'are', 'somehow', 'taken', 'care', 'mysterious', 'force', 'start', 'movie', 'showed', 'great', 'potential', 'are', 'given', 'feasible', 'situation', 'where', 'girls', 'are', 'stranded', 'abandoned', 'home', 'suitable', 'demonstration', 'where', 'new', 'parents', 'can', 'step', 'premise', 'hopefully', 'decent', 'movie', 'Also', 'way', 'girls', 'de-evolve', 'shortly', 'movie', 'quadrapedal', 'deranged', 'social', 'lunatics', 'excellent', 'effect', 'addition', 'story', 'Very', 'creepy.Having', 'said', 'feel', 'movie', 'little', 'short', 'way', 'Firstly', 'most', 'scares', 'are', 'nothing', 'cheap', 'jumps', 'loud', 'noises', 'eerie', 'portruding', 'darkness', 'try', 'make', 'jump', 'seat', 'really', 'not', 'imminent', 'sense', 'danger', 'ghost', 'simply', 'girls', 'company', 'first', 'person', 'harmed', 'more', 'mishap', 'malicious', 'attempt', 'kill.Secondly', 'ending', 'seemed', 'almost', 'silly', 'Spoiler', 'are', 'submitted', 'viewing', 'pleasure', 'almost', 'reenactment', 'ghost', 'past', 'where', 'seemingly', 'involuntarily', 'forced', 'herself', 'child', 'cliff', 'side', 'time', 'new', 'companion', 'little', 'girl', 'Was', 'necessary', 'ritual', 'stop', 'ghost', 'harming', 'anyone', 'else', 'simply', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'relevance', 'what', 'have', 'just', 'given.Lastly', 'whenever', 'someone', 'dark', 'house', 'middle', 'woods', 'pitch', 'black', 'night', 'active', 'pursuit', 'ghost', 'mind', 'seem', 'emotionally', 'forego', 'caring', 'death', 'other', 'words', 'person', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'nobody', 'would', 'right', 'do', 'real', 'life', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'suicidal', 'just', 'plain', 'stupid', 'seemed', 'be', 'cheaply', 'played', 'scare', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'seem', 'scary', 'was', 'more', 'predictable', 'anything', 'most', 'movie.All', 'was', 'fairly', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'reasons', 'listed', 'as', 'well', 'others', 'felt', 'be', 'extremely', 'predictable', 'full', 'cheap', 'jump', 'scenes', 'little', 'intact', 'horror', 'ghost', 'eerie', 'well', 'produced', 'did', 'little', 'make', 'care', 'plight', 'backstory', 'other', 'means', 'ending', 'movie', 'would', 'say', 'watch', 'movie', 'have', 'couple', 'hours', 'burn', 'rainy', 'day', 'possibly', 'nothing', 'else', 'do', 'Maybe', ""'ll"", 'like', 'would', 'definitively', 'say', 'are', 'better', 'horror/', 'ghost', 'stories', 'out', 'there']",N/A

All of a sudden, her magic killer powers are only at half strength for some reason; and despite numerous times of trying to kill the man, & ""put her (Chastain) to sleep"", fails. __ Add to this, the concept developed during the movie: ""the ghost will remain until the wrong is put right""... goes completely out the window; and the ghost does the exact same ""wrong"" -- but still ""dies"" (or whatever) and is ""at peace"".So... Sucky, sucky ending... Which made an otherwise enjoyable movie which I would've bought, a ""straight back to NetFlix, while thanking God I'm a member & didn't pay $25 for this!"" movie.... But I digress...Why bother putting all that content &/or back-story in the movie, if you're going to completely ignore it in the last 5 minutes!??So not only does it not ""pay-off"" -- it ends up making absolutely NO sense... Unless of course, you're just one of those people who enjoy the pretty colors &/or scary images; and pay no attention to the plot/story/etc... Well, as evidenced by a lot of the reviews here, you'll think the ending was cool.The originality pretty much begins and ends with the design of the ghost's look, and the reason behind it -- But I guess it was just really, really nice, not seeing the same old, non-descrip ""ghost"" & ""haunting-movie"", so hats off for at least being that original... even though the idiot, ""writer-director"", completely dropped the ball at the end -- or -- couldn't think of a better way to get to the ending he desired, so he copped-out & hoped no one would notice.If I had 1 Dollar for every time a good movie was ruined by a horrible ending, I'd have enough money to make my own movie... which, I'd of course, ruin the ending on, in an attempt to be ironic, while allowing my own, to start my next ""1 Dollar for every time"" movie-fund.

These elements include: no one can survive in the woods for 5 years, even with ""Mama""; the youngest girl was portrayed as too animalistic; the oldest girl has quite a large vocabulary; the shrink is not credible; from coma to driving (!).The biggest problem was with the resolution. The film morphs into a ""Lifetime Movie,"" with a woman investigating dangerous occurrences on her own and trying to protect her ""daughters."" And the very end will disappoint many viewers. They tried too hard to stick with a particular theme that mimics history, and they do so unnecessarily.

Hagy ""DHagy &#34;movie goer&#34;""","[0, 2]","As with just about any movie these days, some of the best parts of ""Mama"" are what's seen on various trailers and TV spots.  Produced by Guillermo del Toro and directed by Andrew Muschietti, ""Mama"" tells a story of great pain, sadness, and abandonment.  Two young girls (whose roles are marvelously acted)are taken by a very distraught daddy.  It seems he's lost all of his money through bad investments, and he has returned to his company and killed two people.  He has taken his children out for a final drive.  The three end up in a run-down cabin out in the middle of nowhere, and just as daddy is preparing to off his children, the audience gets its first glimpse of mama.  The girls are considered dead until they are discovered, and they are then reunited with their uncle.This is where the movie comes a little off the track, because I was wondering why an uncle--who supposedly was broke--would spend all his money searching for two children who had been lost for over five years?  After they are reunited, they all become pawns in a psychiatrist's attempt delve into the minds of the children.  The one child, Victoria, seems to have adapted better than her younger sister, who can only whisper ""mama.""  The youngest child sleeps under her bed; Victoria sleeps in it.  Mama makes a surprise ""visit,"" knocks uncle down the stairs, so it's up to uncle's girlfriend (played by Jessica Chastain) to take care of the kiddies.  And it seems mama is VERY jealous.I'm won't tell you anymore about the story.  It was adequate enough in providing some actual ""jump"" scenes, but unfortunately the biggest  problem I had with the movie was Mama.  She is of the CGI variety, and because you see so much of her, her appearance becomes almost cliche.  Had they tried a real person for just some of mama, this would have been a much better movie.

There are things that I really like about this movie, but there are things I really can't stand about it too.Let's get the bad out of the way first.  The CGI on Mama was awful.  What should have been something really scary was just ugly (and not in a good way).  The ghost was overly CGIed, and looked pretty horrid in my opinion.However the good far outweighs the bad on this film.  The script is above average for these types of movies.  Sure there are cliched moments, but the story and characters are well written.  Even with a good script the movie could still fall apart without the right actors, and here Jessica Chastain, Megan Charpentier, and Isabelle N&eacute;lisse do a remarkable job.  This is really some of the best acting I've seen in a horror movie in quite a long time.  As Jeffrey, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau is amazing as a man who is at the end of his rope.  The opening scene is really held together by some fantastic directing and Nikolaj's fantastic performance.  Nikolaj's other role as Jeffrey's twin brother Lucas kind of falls into cliched territory in terms of story content (he leaves the girls alone for a good portion of the second half of the film), and it doesn't seem like he was given much to do, but his acting in the opening is quite good.As for the blu-ray itself it has some really good extras (which is why I gave the disc 4 stars and not 3).

They either rely on jolt scares or excessive gore to compensate for atmosphere and a good creepy story. 'Mama' has a little of all those things I mentioned, but never using them to propel the story or to give you false goose bumps.I was impressed with 'Mama' as it delivers much more than I expected it to. It's got a pretty creepy ghost story and I can't remember that last time I watched a horror film and genuinely felt creeped out wondering what was behind that door or what they were going to see next. Besides the good creep factor, it also has some pathos, which is sorely missed from a lot of horror films today, I mean, who will ever forget Karloff's portrayal of the Frankenstein Monster? Or Lon Chaney Jr.'s Wolf Man? Those films just wouldn't be the same without them. Mama has a little of this going for it too as the ghost in the story which I found creepy as hell (even if a little bizarre looking) also makes you have some empathy for this unfortunate creature or spirit. Sure there are some contrivances, but what horror film doesn't have those?If you're looking for a somewhat old fashioned chiller then Mama may be something you want to check out.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[17, 23]","Sometimes it feels like there is nothing new in horror movies -- we just get remakes, sequels, and movies that rely more on gore and nudity than real horror.But sometimes... very occasionally, we get a movie like ""Mama."" This is the closest we're probably going to get to a ""La Llorona: The Movie"" -- an eerie, creeping brand of horror that quietly slips behind you instead of leaping out of dark corners with a screech. And it doesn't hurt that the acting is pretty uniformly brilliant in this movie, even if Jessica Chastain's character arc is a bit predictable.After murdering his wife and business partner, a distraught man named Jeffrey (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) escapes to a cabin in the woods with his two very young daughters. He plans to kill them and then himself, but something destroys him before he has a chance.Five years later, the girls are found -- feral and naked, except for wreaths of flowers. Their uncle Lucas (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau again) immediately volunteers to care for them, although his girlfriend Annabel (Jessica Chastain) is a little more reluctant. Dr. Dreyfuss (Daniel Kash) supports their custody claim and even gives them a McMansion to live in, as long as he has access to the girls.But something strange is afoot -- nightmares, moths and tales of someone the girls call ""Mama."" After Lucas takes a near-fatal fall down the stairs, both Annabel and Dreyfuss begin to suspect that ""Mama"" is not just a coping mechanism, but something that spent years raising the girls in the woods. And she won't let anyone else take care of ""her"" children.It really annoys me when people insist that ""PG-13 horror always sucks!"" -- if it's done with atmosphere and skill, it doesn't need an R-rating or a big budget. ""Mama"" doesn't have a lot of jump scares or grotesque images -- it relies instead on a creeping sense of unease, draped in shadows, fluttering moths, dead leaves and sepia-toned decay.Andres Muschietti has never directed a full-length movie before, but frankly I'm dying to see what he comes up with next. He already has a lot of skill, such as the beautiful scene where we first glimpse Mama in the house -- a single shot of Lily playing with someone, as Victoria and Annabel drift in and out of other rooms. It's a quiet, unmoving shot, but we're left with the growing horror of knowing that SOMETHING unknown is in that room with a little child.And the horror really amps up when we finally DO see Mama. She's a twisted, shadowy creature with scuttling limbs and windblown hair, but she also elicits our pity for her madness and sorrow. She's a classic ghost, and every attack makes perfect sense.It also has some truly excellent acting from, well, EVERYONE. Coster-Waldau is absolutely heartbreaking as a man desperately devoted to his family, and willing to give up everything for his brother's children. Chastain also gives an excellent performance as Annabel, slowly warming up to the children as she slowly becomes aware that something supernatural is creeping into her new suburban life. The one problem: her transition from ""rock chick who doesn't want kids"" to ""loving aunt"" never feels quite natural.And Megan Charpentier and Isabelle N&eacute;lisse... wow. Both of them are absolutely brilliant, which is all the more impressive because they're so young. They give beautifully nuanced performances, especially since they have to act like feral children for awhile. Wow. Like the director, watch these children.""Mama"" is the kind of horror movie that deserves to be a classic -- a dark, twisting story that relies entirely on the most classic kind of ghost there is.

1611667,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B00AIBZLVY,Eric Sanberg,"[1, 1]","Horror movies are like lasagna. They're easy to make but easy to screw up. This is near the top of the pile.Here's the scoop. High-finance dad has gone off the deep end and put bullets into his two business partners and his ex-wife. He's grabbed his two daughters and high-tailed it, at high speed, down an icy road. The car careens over a cliff. They survive, head for a nearby cabin, and as dad is ready to do the girls in someone intervenes and the girls are left on their own. Five years later the girls are found and put in the custody of their uncle Lucas and Annabel, his punk rock girlfriend. They try to bring the children back to normalcy but something is lurking in the background and putting a worm in the apple.I liked this movie a lot. It is shot and directed nearly as well as any movie I've ever seen. Director Andres Muscietti plays one scene with a split screen using a wall in the house as a divider. Watching both sides (one with the action in the foreground, the other with the action further back) is sensational. One of the best scenes anywhere, anytime. The story moves logically and the relationship between a reluctant Annabel and the sisters develops well. It's not a Disney type transition but one that turns out of what Annabel is inside. It feels good. The unraveling of the mystery surrounding mama is pretty good. Not great maybe, but better than I've seen in similar movies. Jessica Chastain is great as Annabel. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau in the Lucas/Jeffrey role is Okay. He just doesn't have that much to do. The girls are outstanding. The older Victoria is remembering her previous normal life while the younger Lily has spent more time with Mama than with her previous folks. The knowing glances between the two and their behavior will creep you out.The downside here is that Mama, and the way the girls move and behave, is too derivative of Japanese horror movies. And jump scares are considered cheap by today's horror standards. There are a couple of cheap ones here but a few others are really good because they are in tune with the way the characters are.This is one of the better horror movies to hit the streets as of late. I like producer Guillermo Del Toro's sensibilities and he must have liked the director's shorter version of this because he put up the bucks to make it feature length.

For some reason, the special effects looked extremely artificial to me. That was my only real complaint, but it hindered my enjoyment of the film.As I was getting ready to write my review, I had this nagging feeling I needed to watch ""Mama"" again. Rarely do I watch a movie twice in such a short period of time, but I was drawn to give it another chance. I can't begin to tell you how glad I am that I did.Two little girls stumble upon a cabin after a car wreck. Five years after their disappearance, they're found and taken into custody by their uncle Lucas and his girlfriend Annabel. The two bring the children into their home and attempt to give them a normal life. As bizarre circumstances unfold, Annabel starts to get the feeling something sinister has accompanied the girls and is ""protecting"" them.For the most part, director / writer Andr&eacute;s Muschietti adheres to the saying ""less is more."" We get quick and creepy glimpses of the supernatural entity. As the movie moves along, we are given longer and greater detailed glances at her. What looked very CGI the first time I took it in proved to be more convincing and practical at second look.I found ""Mama"" full of great moments of genuine thrills and chills upon giving it a second chance. You'd think a horror movie you've seen before wouldn't hold as much tension when watching it again, but that's not the case with ""Mama."" It had more of an effect on me the second time around.Every actor in the movie is convincing in their role. Jessica Chastain transforms from a 1960s blond southern belle into a black-haired punk rocker incredibly well. The girls are absolutely phenomenal and their authentic reactions to the events occurring to them are noteworthy.The audio and video for ""Mama"" will please consumers. A lot of the film is obviously in the dark. This doesn't hinder the viewer from seeing everything they're supposed to. The picture is clean and clear although it has a bleak color palette splashed with autumn tones every once in a while. The 5.1 surround sound will have you jumping out of your seat at every bang, sudden musical burst, and groan seeping out of the speakers.There's a good amount of bonus material provided for the Blu-ray release of ""Mama."" Director / Co-writer Andr&eacute;s Muschietti and Producer / Co-writer Barbara Muschietti contribute feature commentary. The original short film is featured with an introduction by Guillermo del Toro. Two featurettes entitled ""Matriarchal Secrets: The Visual Effects of 'Mama'"" and ""The Birth of 'Mama'"" are found. Deleted scenes are included as well.""Mama"" isn't going to satisfy gore hounds with its ""less is more"" approach and lack of gore. However, gothic horror enthusiasts and those who love a good ghost story with substance will thoroughly enjoy this.

This is absolutely ironic because this movie is not a p/o/r/n feature at all, but, rather, yet another vehicle to give Jessica Chostein's fledgling career a major, main-event push. I think that Mama probably fits into the family-film genre, on account of its heartwarming message and moralistic storyline.In essence, Lucas and Annie are a couple that's liberal and just shacking up with each other instead of being married and doing the relationship thang right. You could say that they just enjoy having sex with each other. Their wholesome relationship, however, is turned upside down when Lucas' two nieces are found in the woods by some Girl Scouts. They are promptly taken to live with Lucas and Annie, and then that's where all the awesomeness starts.At Lucas and Annie's house, they begin to do all sorts of weird sheet, almost like they were raised by wolves or something (which they probably were). They scratch the furniture, sleep at the foot of the bed, and drink water straight from the toilet bowl. In short, they are turning into disruptive, liberal kids that need to be spanked 24/7. So what do Lucas and Annie do? They start to discipline them by slapping them, beating them and, yes, making them watch Rachel Maddow on MSNBC as a last resort. All hell then breaks loose, though.As soon as Lucas and Annie begin taking revenge on these kids, the poltergeist that really raised them and was their ""mama"" begins to take revenge on...Lucas and Annie. It starts to have sex with Annie, and then coldly leaves her alone in bed when the morning comes, without even calling her the next day!! B/a/s/t/a/r/d!!!

""Mama"" is a creepy, evil-looking creature that you had wonderfully elusive glimpses of throughout the film until the ending when you saw the creature it all it's magnificent, evil glory.  The story catches you up and makes you care about the characters.  The acting was very good, especially from the two little girls, and Jessica Chastain is amazing in everything she does.The film begins with the failure of a huge corporation and a number of suicides by people in key positions.  The father was one of those people, but first he killed his wife, took his two young daughters and headed into the mountains during a snowstorm.  The car swerves off the road deep into the forest, the father takes them out of the car where they find an old abandoned house.  Inside he has one of the daughters look out the window as he begins to point a gun at the back of her head.  This is when Mama appears for the first time and yanks the father away to his death to save the girls.  The girls are found about 5 years later and had become feral, walking on all fours and almost as scary as Mama herself.  They are taken in by their father's twin brother and his girlfriend (played brilliantly by Jessica Chastain).  They ARE taken back to the city, but something follows them.....This is a wonderfully creepy movie with LOTS of legitimate scares (NO CHEAP SHOTS HERE!)!

1611691,A1Y0HX12MCT6OR,B00AIBZLVY,I'm Right,"[0, 0]","Mama has a lot of things going for it, as well as a few hindrances. Overall though it's a pretty basic ghost story with a few original flourishes here and there. One thing I especially liked about it was two feral little kids, there were some parts where I saw them moving abnormally and thought ""OH GOD WTF IS THAT!?"", all without the use of quickly amplifying the volume up to 11 for an obnoxious startling noise. The ghost design for Mama was also pretty original and disturbing looking, and there would be (few) moments with her just lingering in the background or something and it had a creeping effect. Jessica Chastain as the main chick did an above-and-beyond performance with her character, not to mention she was smokin' hot throughout the movie. I know critics praised her skeletal FBI redhead look in Zero Dark Thirty, but I sure wouldn't mind seeing her don the punk rock look for a little longer. Other things that were nice were when she finally breaks through to one of the kids, it was an unexpected scene and was a nice break from the usual horror monotony regarding Investigate/SCARE/Investigate/SCARE.So you've probably noticed that some of these compliments are backhanded, well for all Mama's strengths it still had a few things going against it. Most notably, LOUD UNEXPECTED JUMP SCARES. I know these are pretty standard for PG-13 horror movies but... why!? It's not clever, it's not well done, it's just f***ing cheap. BOO! Startled!? That'll be $10 please. That's how I feel watching these movies and being annoyed that I have to turn down the volume when everything gets quiet. The worst part is that Mama would've been a perfectly fine horror movie without the HOLY S*** THAT'S LOUD crap; the ghost designs and story were perfectly fine enough without this cheap, lazy jump-scare B.S.Alright I feel better, also Jamie Lannister takes a backseat for most of the movie and does occasional snooping around to investigate ghastly origins, similar to what Ned Stark did in Silent Hill. I would've been more interested to see him and Jessica take on the ghostly stuff together as a couple, instead of ""woman alone in a haunted house"" standard stuff. Also some parts in the plot didn't make much sense, most notably *spoiler* if Mama wanted to re-enact her death with the kids, why didn't she do that in the first place when it was just them in the cabin for 5 years? Ugh. This wasn't a bad movie, but it annoys me more than a straight-bad movie would because it was ridiculously close to being a great movie, and instead it's cheapened up and dumbed down to be instead ""decent"".

The opening act is atmospheric and creepy and doesn't give away too much about what to expect and certainly the little girls are disturbing enough to stay off my Christmas list. There are some of Guillermo Del Toro's trademark fantasy elements and initially at least the camera moves are subtle enough to bring some well-executed scares early on.Plot-wise, it starts to go off the deep end almost immediately the girls are rescued. The psychological evaluation part of the film doesn't really go anywhere and the seemingly obligatory Internet Research Scene was a really lazy way to spoon-feed the audience exposition about what's going on. The new parents, played ably by Jessica Chastain and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, start to act like their common sense glands have been removed and seem to ignore the growing supernatural signs that it's time to get out of the house and head to Disneyland. Even the characterization of the two leads at the beginning of the film is completely forgotten by the midpoint.Unfortunately, as with almost every horror I've seen in the last couple of years, the overuse of CGI kills the scares completely and rehashes so many of the effects from previous films.

Not only are the scenes and sets spooky, but the actual Mama character is exposed early enough into the film to conjure image when floor boards creak.  Even if she did sort of look like a CG version of the central character from Munch's ""Scream.""  Adding a heaping does of uneasiness are the two little girls themselves.  Neither will be invited to neighborhood birthday parties any time soon.  The casting is done pretty well, and all actors held their screentime powerfully.  Ultimately, however, there is nearly nothing new, and the ending is as predictable as the Farmer's Almanac.  What isn't completely predictable is the ending.  Yeah, about that.  It's a horribly mixed message leaving the ending easily the worst part of the film.  Regardless of how it's examined, Mama makes a decision that leaves viewers unsatisfied.

The majority of the movie worked really well; it was suspenseful, it was scary and there were some jump in your seat moments.  Both of the little girls did a really good job with the acting.  One of the reasons it worked so well is because for the first part of the movie, you don't ever see Mama clearly.  You see shadows, you see quick images jump out and then are gone.  It's suggestion and innuendo, and to me that's always what's worked best in scary movies anyway.  Our imaginations fill in the blanks and scare us much better than any Hollywood makeup can.I liked the movie right up until the last ten minutes.  I didn't like the ending.  Mama went from being evil ghost to misunderstood apparition.  And that just didn't work for me.  It just didn't seem to flow with the rest of the movie.Still, I would recommend the movie.

1611718,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B00AIBZLVY,John's Horror Corner,"[94, 104]","Good acting, a monster that I don't see too little, good effects (even if it is all just CGI) and a story I can swallow...we have a winner!  This movie is nothing epic nor did it have the best scares I've seen in a while, but it's a horror movie that ""works.""First time feature director Andr&eacute;s Muschietti  (writer/director of the short film Mam&aacute;) does a solid job with atmosphere and ""creepy.""  The story gets moving when two orphaned girls are discovered in an abandoned cabin in the woods after five years somehow surviving on their own (now they're about 9 and 7 years old-ish).  Their eyes are cold and scared yet somehow predatory, their hair and skin far beyond wildly filthy, and their movement is so unnatural that it reminds me more of a Silent Hill monster than an animal.  More disturbing was the degeneration of their oral skills with the exception of whispering ""mama.""Much to my surprise, the maternal poltergeist Mama was not a kept mystery.  Mama, her appearance, what she's capable of and her relationship with the girls are all presented to us right away.  So when the feral Victoria (Megan Charpentier; Resident Evil: Retribution, Red Riding Hood, Jennifer's Body) and Lilly are taken in by uncle Lucas (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) and his girlfriend Annabel (Jessica Chastain), the movie doesn't rely on us wondering when Mama will pop up and reign terror on the new foster parents.  Instead we watch the girls maintain a secret relationship with Mama while remaining emotionally distant from Lucas and Annabel.But once their child psychologist and the new parents catch on to Mama's presence, simply a psychological manifestation or even a home invader by their perception, Mama feels threatened.  And once the girls begin to open up to the doctor or feel affection for their new parents, Mama gets pissed!  So we find ourselves not only nervous when we're ""normally"" nervous in these movies (e.g., walking in dark halls, opening the ajar closet door, looking over your shoulder to see what the girls are looking at), but we're also nervous when things wouldn't normally be unnerving...like when we see Annabel desperately hugging a thrashing Lilly, who starts to find the embrace comforting...I wonder if Mama is watching.What's interesting is how this movie has such a simple story with one simple revelation toward its end, no red herrings and no real surprises--yet, it really works.  I thought they had some trouble making the finale at the end come together, actually I thought it was too drawn out and a bit weak, but overall I was VERY pleased with this movie.We start out feeling edgy about the girls, and as they normalize we start feeling edgy about Mama (Javier Botet; creature actor of all three [REC] films).  And Mama is worth feeling edgy about.  She looks quite contorted, distorted and disturbing, moves like a bipedal yet quadriplegic demon on meth, and manifests an aura of decay.  I felt effectively continuously worried about what this apparition was going to do next, and the pace of the movie never disappoints.I feel like we've been trained to find piss poor acting to be totally acceptable when it comes to horror.  But Mama's cast features nothing but competency and a few pleasant surprises.  Of course, no one should be shocked that Jessica Chastain pulled off the stand-offish girlfriend turned hesitant parent.  But what about young Megan Charpentier?  As the reserved older sister Victoria and her stone cold portrayal of The Red Queen in the latest Resident Evil installment she has all the makings of both one of the youngest Scream Queens ever, but also a talented young actress!This movie was a pleasure with good characters, a monster that I don't see too little, good effects (even if it is all just CGI) and a story I can swallow.

At 100 minutes I was expecting a quick,predictable movie. I am glad to say that is not the case with Mama. This is one of those RARE films that second after second, I was anxiously awaiting what was going to happen next. And THAT my friends, is a good thing. Jessica Chastain (being one of the better known stars of this movie) did a really great job as Annabel and the two young girls in the film, Lily and Victoria (Not known what their real names are) are absolutely splendid in Mama.

The scares are mostly the jump type, accompanied by loud bursts of music instead of genuine terror. Another problem is the CGI...it kills any suspense or scares because it just looks fake. I wish the movie business would back off on CGI and use it just to enhance things (if they MUST) because it NEVER looks real (Check out Slither if you want to see a current (ish) film with practical effects (its a blast of a film too, very fun)). Near the end I actually laughed at some of the reveal ""scares"". CGI is at its worst trying to make a humanoid. Why, why, why, would a human ghost need to be all CGI? They should have cast an actor for the part, done conventional make up efx, and added CGI for small details. It would have looked real. The CGI ruined the movie for me.Del Toro does not direct this movie and it is no where near the quality of his films. It is almost unfair to the real director to paste Del Toro's name on the film because you immediately expect a very high quality film and are let down. If he had released it without his name on it I probably would have not been so disappointed. If you want to see one of his ghost films, check out The Orphanage, or the Devils Backbone (that one is terrifying and pure Del Toro).

This is how the story goes: Five years ago, sisters Victoria and Lilly vanished from their suburban neighborhood without a trace. Since then, their Uncle Lucas and his girlfriend, Annabel have been madly searching for them. But when, incredibly, the kids are found alive in a decrepit cabin, the couple wonders if the girls are the only guests they have welcomed into their home. As Annabel tries to introduce the children to a normal life, she grows convinced of an evil presence in their house. Are the sisters experiencing traumatic stress, or is a ghost coming to visit them? How did the broken girls survive those years all alone? As she answers these disturbing questions, the new mother will find that the whispers she hears at bedtime are coming from the lips of a deadly presence.The cast led by Jessica Chastain (as Annabel) & Nikolaj Coster-Wadlau (as Lucas / Jeffrey) is great. The directing by Andres Muschietti (who also wrote the story & screenplay) is great.

Mama by Guillermo del Toro is not quite as good as Pan's Labyrinth but more horrific overall. The effects of the children themselves in the movie are some of the most weirdly horrifying I've witnessed on film. What the Grudge did for the possession walk of the Exorcist, Mama takes to a whole new menacing level. I've heard complaints that the actual ghost of Mama could have been more horrifying and less cartoonish, but to me it was powerfully moving. The key, once you see and get to know her, is to begin to identify with her and feel her pain. Annabel, played by Jessica Chastain, is the analogue to Mama in the world of the living with whom we are also to identify. The link between Annabel, Mama and us is deliberately crafted be del Toro and beautifully so in my opinion.

Why?  Good understandable plot, well thought out with enough scarey twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat the entire movie.  The 2 little girls are incredible little actors and completely believable.  All characters gave great performances. To me there were no villians, but how can you make a movie without a bad guy. And so the ghost is made ugly and scarey and murderous.  If you think about the characters, their stories are truly heart-breaking.OK - A woman in an institution a lifetime or more ago, snatches/grabs her infant child from the nurse and makes a break for it.  She is chased by big angry men thru the woods to the edge of a cliff.  Her choice; let the men take her back to the institution and never see her child again or jump to her and her childs death.  She jumps.  Move forward to today.  A distraught father takes his 2 small daughters, one is little more than a baby, in his car from their home to somewhere up in the mountains. He is speeding down an icey road in a snowstorm. He is driving like a madman.  The girls are frightened and crying.  The oldest girl begs him to slow down.  The car skids, goes over an embankment and crashes into a tree.  He grabs the girls, dragging them thru the woods and finds an old abandoned cabin.  He is obviously crazy with grief.  Crying and distraught, he holds his one child and puts a gun to her head.  In the next moment he is savagely attacked by ??? the ghost?  Next you see the two little girls sitting on the floor of the cabin.  They are alone.  Who will ever find them.  How will they survive without heat, clothing, water, utilities and food, especially in the long cold winter.  Out of the darkness, rolling across the dusty floor comes a cherry.  It's a cherry the smallest girl exclaims.  -Go forward several years-  The girls Uncle had never given up hope of finding the girls.  He has spent all his money and has frustated his girlfriend in his obsession to find them.  Just has he has spent his last penny the girls are found.  They are little more than wild animals, but they are alive.  How could this be?  In the center of the cabin's main room is a waist high pile of cherry pits.  OK, a little far fetched, but stick with me on this one.  The Uncle is thrilled they are found and decides to take them to live with him.  The girlfriend is a free spirit (plays in a band tattoos and all) and is not thrilled with this.  And little do they know, but with the girls comes the ghost.  The grieving mother who jumped to her death.  Her body was found, but never the child's.  She had been searching for her child all those years when the distraught father came to the cabin in that area.  When she heard the children crying and pleading and saw that the children were in mortal danger, she stepped in and saved them.  She cared for them, played with them, fed them and protected them.  You come to understand that her love for the two girls replaced the love and loss of her child she had been searching for for so long.  But now others have taken these children from her too.  How the rest plays out will keep you guessing.  You fear for the children.  The adults at first have no clue.  When they each do get a clue, the ghost steps in. You never know what is coming next. The children are torn between the real world and the love of ""Mama"".  When you believe all hope is lost. The hero in the movie is the least likely.  It is a bitter/sad battle to the very end.  And just when you believe it IS the end, IT ISN'T!This is a really good movie.  Possibly the only really good ""ghost"" movie.

1611758,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00AIBZLVY,Mark Turner,"[2, 3]","With the overabundance of horror films coming out, it's difficult to decide what you should or should not watch. My son, a die hard horror fan, found the recent THE PURGE a total disappointment and yet they got his ticket money. So when a truly creepy, terrifying film comes out its only natural that fans will pass the word along. Let me pass the word right now about MAMA - I loved it!The story opens with an investment banker having a breakdown, killing his partners and his wife and then taking his daughters to a secluded house in the woods where he intends to kill them and then himself. Before he can follow through with this act he is whisked away by an unseen force and the girls are left to fend for themselves...or with the help of their unseen benefactor.Fast forward 5 years and we come to Lucas (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau), the girl's uncle, who has spent what resources he has on someone searching for them. As the group is about to stop they do indeed find the girls. At a clinic where they are being watched and taken care of Dr. Dreyfuss (Daniel Kash) does his best to help the girls readjust to their new surroundings. In doing so he later explains to Lucas that the girls seem to have created an unseen friend called Mama. Eventually they're able to return to their family and a battle for the girls between their aunt Jean and Lucas results in Lucas having custody.Along with his girlfriend Annabelle (Jessica Chastain), a bass player in a rock band, they are aided by the doctor. He wants to continue to treat the girls and knowing their aunt will move them across country, he provides this new family with a home to stay in owned by the clinic he works in. But his research isn't limited to the girls in the home. We witness him traveling to a different city to look into the past of someone we're unaware of yet.At the home the girls seem a bit gun shy at first but slowly begin to open up to Lucas. This doesn't last long as some unseen entity knocks him over the railing at the top of the stairs and he ends up in the hospital. Now Annabelle, who wants nothing to do with children, is left to oversee these two. It's a slow adjustment but eventually she wins the trust of the girls and the friendship of the elder of the pair, Victoria (Megan Carpentier). An incident with the younger girl, Lilly (Isabelle Nelisse) breaks down her walls as well.But someone, or something, in the house still seems to preoccupy the girls, most notably Lilly. We get not glimpses but a full on look at just what is behind this but have no idea yet what is causing this image to appear. I won't spoil it by saying just what that is but I will offer a word of advice: if you scare easy, keep the blanket pulled close to your eyes. And if you know someone who scares easy, make sure they don't have hold of your arm for fear of an injury during one of the many scenes guaranteed to make you jump.This film is not just a scare fest but a film filled with just the right tone to make your skin crawl at all the right moments and some of the not right moments as well. Visions of ""Mama"" are certain to become the things of nightmares for children whose parents allow them to watch this film thinking that the PG-13 rating makes it safe for them. It isn't. They will be scared. Come to think of it I might have to turn on my lights tonight before going to bed.The behind the scenes efforts on this film are tremendous. The direction by Andres Muschietti is wonderful and he pulls some outstanding performances not just from the adult actors but from the children in particular. To think that children this young could pull off the job it takes to make this believable and to make you care is amazing and they do it with apparent ease.The special effects seen here are also outstanding. They convey the slow moving rot that appears from time to time and then blast you out of your seat with one of the scariest visages in some time. Perhaps not enough that you'll look away but enough that it will stick with you.Readers will know after all these years that I am a fan of horror, sometimes too much so. But this was one film that I know I'll be watching more than once and enjoying each and every time. And while I enjoy it there is one thing I know I'll do for at least the first few times around: keep the lights on.",4,TIME FOR YOUR SKIN TO CRAWL,1374019200,"07 17, 2013",2013,4314,"['overabundance', 'horror', 'films', 'coming', 'out', 'difficult', 'decide', 'what', 'should', 'should', 'not', 'watch', 'My', 'son', 'die', 'hard', 'horror', 'fan', 'found', 'recent', 'THE', 'PURGE', 'total', 'disappointment', 'yet', 'got', 'ticket', 'money', 'So', 'when', 'truly', 'creepy', 'terrifying', 'film', 'out', 'only', 'natural', 'fans', 'will', 'pass', 'word', 'Let', 'pass', 'word', 'right', 'now', 'MAMA', 'loved', 'story', 'investment', 'banker', 'having', 'breakdown', 'killing', 'partners', 'wife', 'then', 'taking', 'daughters', 'secluded', 'house', 'woods', 'where', 'kill', 'then', 'can', 'follow', 'act', 'whisked', 'away', 'unseen', 'force', 'girls', 'are', 'left', 'fend', 'help', 'unseen', 'benefactor.Fast', 'forward', '5', 'years', 'come', 'Lucas', 'Nikolaj', 'Coster-Waldau', 'girl', 'uncle', 'who', 'spent', 'what', 'resources', 'someone', 'searching', 'group', 'stop', 'do', 'indeed', 'find', 'girls', 'clinic', 'where', 'are', 'being', 'watched', 'taken', 'care', 'Dr.', 'Dreyfuss', 'Daniel', 'Kash', 'best', 'help', 'girls', 'readjust', 'new', 'surroundings', 'doing', 'so', 'later', 'Lucas', 'girls', 'seem', 'have', 'created', 'unseen', 'friend', 'called', 'Mama', 'Eventually', ""'re"", 'able', 'return', 'family', 'battle', 'girls', 'aunt', 'Jean', 'Lucas', 'results', 'Lucas', 'having', 'custody.Along', 'girlfriend', 'Annabelle', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'bass', 'player', 'rock', 'band', 'are', 'aided', 'doctor', 'continue', 'treat', 'girls', 'knowing', 'aunt', 'will', 'move', 'country', 'new', 'family', 'home', 'stay', 'owned', 'clinic', 'research', ""n't"", 'limited', 'girls', 'home', 'witness', 'traveling', 'different', 'city', 'look', 'past', 'someone', ""'re"", 'unaware', 'yet.At', 'home', 'girls', 'seem', 'bit', 'gun', 'shy', 'first', 'slowly', 'begin', 'open', 'up', 'Lucas', ""n't"", 'last', 'long', 'unseen', 'entity', 'railing', 'top', 'stairs', 'up', 'hospital', 'Now', 'Annabelle', 'who', 'nothing', 'do', 'children', 'left', 'oversee', 'two', 'slow', 'adjustment', 'eventually', 'trust', 'girls', 'friendship', 'elder', 'pair', 'Victoria', 'Megan', 'Carpentier', 'incident', 'younger', 'girl', 'Lilly', 'Isabelle', 'Nelisse', 'down', 'walls', 'well.But', 'someone', 'something', 'house', 'still', 'preoccupy', 'girls', 'most', 'notably', 'Lilly', 'get', 'not', 'glimpses', 'full', 'look', 'just', 'what', 'have', 'idea', 'yet', 'what', 'causing', 'image', 'appear', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'saying', 'just', 'what', 'will', 'offer', 'word', 'advice', 'scare', 'easy', 'keep', 'blanket', 'pulled', 'close', 'eyes', 'know', 'someone', 'who', 'easy', 'make', 'sure', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'hold', 'arm', 'fear', 'injury', 'one', 'many', 'scenes', 'guaranteed', 'make', 'jump.This', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'scare', 'fest', 'film', 'filled', 'just', 'right', 'tone', 'make', 'skin', 'crawl', 'right', 'moments', 'not', 'right', 'moments', 'as', 'well', 'Visions', 'Mama', 'are', 'certain', 'become', 'things', 'nightmares', 'children', 'parents', 'allow', 'watch', 'film', 'thinking', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'safe', ""n't"", 'will', 'be', 'scared', 'Come', 'think', 'might', 'have', 'turn', 'lights', 'tonight', 'going', 'bed.The', 'scenes', 'efforts', 'film', 'are', 'tremendous', 'direction', 'Andres', 'Muschietti', 'wonderful', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'not', 'just', 'adult', 'actors', 'children', 'particular', 'think', 'children', 'young', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'job', 'make', 'believable', 'make', 'care', 'amazing', 'do', 'apparent', 'ease.The', 'special', 'effects', 'seen', 'here', 'are', 'also', 'outstanding', 'convey', 'slow', 'moving', 'rot', 'time', 'time', 'then', 'blast', 'seat', 'one', 'scariest', 'visages', 'time', 'Perhaps', 'not', 'enough', ""'ll"", 'look', 'away', 'enough', 'will', 'stick', 'you.Readers', 'will', 'know', 'years', 'am', 'fan', 'horror', 'sometimes', 'too', 'much', 'so', 'was', 'one', 'film', 'know', ""'ll"", 'be', 'watching', 'more', 'once', 'enjoying', 'time', 'enjoy', 'one', 'thing', 'know', ""'ll"", 'do', 'least', 'first', 'few', 'times', 'keep', 'lights']",N/A

They are then taken to a hospital or psychiatric care facility or whatever before being put in the custody of their uncle and his girlfriend Joan Jett. It's not long before they begin to notice that something else has come with them, and it doesn't like the noobs.WARNING SPOILER ALERTS: Don't read on unless you want to.The first half of the movie is decent. However out of nowhere comes the idea that Mama is a bad entity and her history is revealed that she is a bad person. Her intention in the end is she is going to sacrifice the kids. Huh? First she rescues them, then raises them for 5 years, only to want to kill them? This protector to killer plot turn made no sense. She does not abuse them, she takes care of them, yet she is only waiting to kill them? Ok then... dumb idea... the kids become animal like and walk like their mama, like a monkey or something, yet instantly the eldest girl remembers how to walk upright and speak English... but the other one remains the same for a while, but slowly begins to return to human-like. Pick a direction already, are they f'd up, or not? They just become normal again and the youngest one they say probably wont speak just wakes her sister in the night by walking normally over to her and saying ""mama's here""? It's not a huge plot hole, but to me it would be like Hulk Hogan breaking character in the middle of a wrestling match and asking for some tea while he plays a round of crochet with the Queen. They may as well have had mama stop to look into the camera, break the 4th wall and say calmly, ""remember, this only a movie, don't be scared, look at me UN-rendered as a 3D polygon""Then the ending. Are you kidding me? The cliff and mama is flying around all over the place? Make up your mind, is she a crawler or a flyer? It went from slightly believable to extremely laughable. And what was the point of the side story of the ghosts baby? She finds it, cries about it, euhh, bugger it, be angry. Was that needed if that's what the pay-off of that sub-story was about? They may as well have removed it all together, as it meant nothing in the movie. Then no big way to rid the ghost witch... nah, she'll do it herself and explode into butterflies. ""Yes officer, we're ok now. One kid survived, but the other, well the butterfly witch committed suicide with her so we won't be needing her bed anymore, got a number for the Good Will?""Overall: sucks you in enough to be interesting, then blows it in the end.",2,Not Da Mama,1374451200,"07 22, 2013",2013,3304,"['When', 'father', '2', 'children', 'mother', 'find', 'being', 'driven', 'woods', 'edge', 'father', 'who', 'unsure', 'what', 'do', 'situation', 'icy', 'road', 'car', 'control', 'collides', 'tree', 'side', 'road', 'father', 'two', 'daughters', 'leave', 'wreck', 'enter', 'cabin', 'woods', 'face', 'palm', 'where', 'father', 'kids', 'mommy', 'not', 'coming', 'shoot', 'two', 'young', 'girls', 'aged', '2', '4', 'something', 'else', 'house', 'killing', 'kids', 'instead', 'reverses', 'idea', 'spirit', 'known', 'mamma', 'girls', 'cut', '5', 'years', 'later', 'where', 'brother', 'kids', 'father', 'still', 'search', 'what', 'ever', 'happened', 'brother', 'kids', 'Finally', 'have', 'been', 'found', 'wild', 'weird', 'animalistic', 'are', 'then', 'taken', 'hospital', 'psychiatric', 'care', 'facility', 'being', 'put', 'custody', 'uncle', 'girlfriend', 'Joan', 'Jett', 'not', 'long', 'begin', 'notice', 'something', 'else', 'come', ""n't"", 'like', 'noobs.WARNING', 'SPOILER', 'ALERTS', 'Do', ""n't"", 'read', 'want', 'to.The', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'decent', 'However', 'nowhere', 'idea', 'Mama', 'bad', 'entity', 'history', 'revealed', 'bad', 'person', 'intention', 'end', 'going', 'sacrifice', 'kids', 'Huh', 'First', 'then', '5', 'years', 'only', 'want', 'kill', 'protector', 'killer', 'plot', 'turn', 'made', 'sense', 'not', 'abuse', 'care', 'yet', 'only', 'waiting', 'kill', 'Ok', 'then', 'dumb', 'idea', 'kids', 'become', 'animal', 'walk', 'mama', 'monkey', 'something', 'yet', 'instantly', 'eldest', 'girl', 'how', 'walk', 'upright', 'speak', 'English', 'other', 'one', 'same', 'while', 'slowly', 'return', 'human-like', 'Pick', 'direction', 'already', 'are', 'f', ""'d"", 'up', 'not', 'just', 'become', 'normal', 'again', 'youngest', 'one', 'say', 'probably', 'wont', 'speak', 'just', 'sister', 'night', 'walking', 'normally', 'saying', 'mama', 'here', 'not', 'huge', 'plot', 'hole', 'would', 'be', 'Hulk', 'Hogan', 'breaking', 'character', 'middle', 'wrestling', 'match', 'asking', 'tea', 'round', 'crochet', 'Queen', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'had', 'mama', 'stop', 'look', 'camera', 'break', '4th', 'wall', 'say', 'calmly', 'remember', 'only', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'scared', 'look', 'UN-rendered', '3D', 'polygon', 'Then', 'ending', 'Are', 'kidding', 'cliff', 'mama', 'flying', 'place', 'Make', 'up', 'mind', 'crawler', 'flyer', 'went', 'slightly', 'believable', 'extremely', 'laughable', 'was', 'point', 'side', 'story', 'ghosts', 'baby', 'euhh', 'bugger', 'be', 'angry', 'Was', 'needed', 'what', 'pay-off', 'sub-story', 'was', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'removed', 'together', 'meant', 'nothing', 'movie', 'Then', 'big', 'way', 'rid', 'ghost', 'witch', 'nah', ""'ll"", 'do', 'explode', 'butterflies', 'Yes', 'officer', ""'re"", 'ok', 'now', 'One', 'kid', 'survived', 'other', 'well', 'butterfly', 'witch', 'committed', 'suicide', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'needing', 'bed', 'anymore', 'got', 'number', 'Good', 'Will', 'Overall', 'sucks', 'enough', 'be', 'interesting', 'then', 'end']",N/A

These two were just awesome...especially the littlest one named Lilly....with all her little growls and eating on the floor with the family pet. HILARIOUS.

She's actually in good company with award winning stars like Nicole Kidman (""The Others"") and Naomi Watts (""The Ring"" 1 & 2) to name a couple.  Here Chastain plays Annabel, a Suzi Quatro-like bassist in a punk rock band, complete with short dark hair and tatted up arms.  She is the main squeeze of Lucas, a starving artist type played by Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, perhaps best known as the incestuous prince on ""Game of Thrones.""The story begins with the twin brother of Lucas going on a killing rampage that includes fellow workers and his wife.  He takes his 2 young daughters out into the country with similar intent.  Before he can commit the deed a mysterious apparition intervenes.  Five years later Lucas is still trying to find out what happened to his brother and nieces.Ultimately found, the girls have somehow managed to survive but are little more than wild animals.  Director Andres Muschietti manages to provide enough suspense to keep viewers on the edge on their seats using quick cuts and lighting.  At the same time, he also resorts to the usual ""gotcha"" moments complete with a jolting sound effect.Annabel is the main focus in the story however as the girlfriend who reluctantly has to take over child care duties after Lucas is hospitalized thanks to an induced fall down a flight of stairs.  Chastain is excellent in the role and proves her dramatic range.  ""Mama"" is an above average horror film that relies on suspense rather than gore for chilling effects.  For me the ghostly presence's transformation to a CGI manifestation in the final act was unnecessary and changes the tone of the film somewhat.

1611798,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00AIBZLVY,Paul Allaer,"[0, 1]","""Mama"" (2013 release; 100 min.) introduces us to two girls, ages 3 and 1, who are kidnapped by their crazed dad (who has gone off the cliff due to the financial crisis). After an almost fatal car accident, the girls are abandoned by their dad in a remote cabin in the woods. Fast forward 5 years later: in a miracle, the girls, now 8 and 6, are found alive in the same cabin but they are almost savages now, in particular the youngest one. (Don't ask how they managed to survive on their own for 5 years...) The girls are given into the custody of their dad's brother and his girlfriend Anabelle (played by Chastain), while also still being treated by the psychologist. For Anabelle, a free spirit who plays bass guitar in a local rock band and is heavily tattoed, it is a difficult transition. On top of that, the girls have invented an imaginary (or is it?) guardian, Mama. To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing pleasure, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: first and foremost, this is the second weekend in a row that I catch Jessica Chastain, and this time her character couldn't be more different from the one in Zero Dark Thirty, also visually (from long red hair to short coal-black hair). Chastain has risen in a matter of just a few years to the very top of Hollywood. I loved her last year in ""Lawless"" and in 2011 in ""The Tree of Life"" and ""The Debt"". Here again her performance outshines everything else, including the special effects. To be honest, it is unlikely that I would've even gone to see this movie if Chastain were not in it. As to the 'horror' aspects of the movie, they were mostly derivative (yet another take on the ""spider"" walk outtake from the Exorcist, for example) but it all worked quite nicely. After the movie was over my initial reaction was that this was more about mother-like care for kids not your own than a true horror movie.This movie was executive-produced by Guillermo del Toro who seems to have a knack for these types of movies (Don't Be Afraid of the Dark, Splice, etc.). Finally, it's a shame that they weren't able to find a way to get that Genesis song ""Mama"" (a hit single from their 1983 self-titled album) somehow into the movie or at least for the closing credits. Oh well. Meanwhile, if you are on the edge about seeing this movie, come for the horror and I will guarantee you'll stay for Jessica Chastain.",4,"Come for the horror, stay for Jessica Chastain",1358553600,"01 19, 2013",2013,2417,"['Mama', '2013', 'release', '100', 'min', 'two', 'girls', '3', '1', 'who', 'are', 'kidnapped', 'crazed', 'dad', 'who', 'gone', 'off', 'cliff', 'due', 'financial', 'crisis', 'almost', 'fatal', 'car', 'accident', 'girls', 'are', 'abandoned', 'dad', 'remote', 'cabin', 'woods', 'Fast', 'forward', '5', 'years', 'later', 'miracle', 'girls', 'now', '8', '6', 'are', 'found', 'alive', 'same', 'cabin', 'are', 'almost', 'savages', 'now', 'particular', 'youngest', 'one', 'Do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'how', 'managed', 'survive', 'own', '5', 'years', 'girls', 'are', 'given', 'custody', 'dad', 'brother', 'girlfriend', 'Anabelle', 'played', 'Chastain', 'also', 'still', 'being', 'treated', 'psychologist', 'Anabelle', 'free', 'spirit', 'who', 'bass', 'guitar', 'local', 'rock', 'band', 'heavily', 'tattoed', 'difficult', 'transition', 'top', 'girls', 'have', 'invented', 'imaginary', 'guardian', 'Mama', 'tell', 'more', 'plot', 'would', 'ruin', 'viewing', 'pleasure', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'see', 'how', 'out.Several', 'comments', 'first', 'foremost', 'second', 'weekend', 'row', 'catch', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'time', 'character', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'different', 'one', 'Zero', 'Dark', 'Thirty', 'also', 'visually', 'long', 'red', 'hair', 'short', 'coal-black', 'hair', 'Chastain', 'risen', 'matter', 'just', 'few', 'years', 'very', 'top', 'Hollywood', 'loved', 'last', 'year', 'Lawless', '2011', 'Tree', 'Life', 'Debt', 'Here', 'again', 'performance', 'outshines', 'everything', 'else', 'including', 'special', 'effects', 'be', 'honest', 'unlikely', 'would', ""'ve"", 'even', 'gone', 'see', 'movie', 'Chastain', 'were', 'not', ""'horror"", 'aspects', 'movie', 'were', 'mostly', 'derivative', 'yet', 'take', 'spider', 'outtake', 'Exorcist', 'example', 'worked', 'quite', 'nicely', 'movie', 'was', 'initial', 'reaction', 'was', 'was', 'more', 'mother-like', 'care', 'kids', 'not', 'own', 'true', 'horror', 'movie.This', 'movie', 'was', 'executive-produced', 'Guillermo', 'del', 'Toro', 'who', 'have', 'knack', 'types', 'movies', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Be', 'Afraid', 'Dark', 'Splice', 'etc.', 'Finally', 'shame', 'were', ""n't"", 'able', 'find', 'way', 'get', 'Genesis', 'song', 'Mama', 'hit', 'single', '1983', 'self-titled', 'album', 'somehow', 'movie', 'least', 'closing', 'credits', 'Oh', 'well', 'Meanwhile', 'are', 'edge', 'seeing', 'movie', 'come', 'horror', 'will', 'guarantee', ""'ll"", 'stay', 'Jessica', 'Chastain']",N/A

However, like most movie addicts although I love reading reviews they never dictate to me whether to see or not see a film that's caught my interest.As a marketing ploy, instead of a tag line or knock out review - the movie poster itself as well as all advertising for ""Mama"" features the huge message "" From The Creator Of Pans Labyrinth""Key word ""Creator"" not director. So of course it would be a mistake going in to expect the sheer brilliance of the modern day classic Pan's Labyrinth by Guillermo del Toro.

This PG-13 rated movie isn't for everyone, but if you are a fan of horror, and like to be scared silly, you shouldn't miss it. Though not the most original film, it packs a heavy fear-factor for every ghost-loving movie goer.MamaReviewed by Raven D, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic""Mama"" tells the story of two young sisters, Lily and Victoria, who are abandoned in the woods for five years. When the girls are found and taken into custody by their uncle and his girlfriend Annabelle, everyone begins to wonder how these toddlers could have survived for so long on their own. The girls' strange behavior leads Annabell to believe that the girls weren't alone in the woods after all, and in fact, a troubled ghost called Mama was caring for them. But when they leave the forest, they don't leave Mama.I really enjoy this movie. It is definitely scary to watch, but when it is over it doesn't leave you feeling afraid. I'm convinced this movie is a mix between ""The Woman in Black"" and ""The Possession."" It has a very similar ghost with the same motives as The Woman in Black, and has the same creepy bugs from ""The Possession."" The ending is especially similar to ""The Woman in Black."" No spoiler alerts or anything, but you think all will be fine but it's not. I guess you shouldn't go to a horror film if you're looking for a happy ending.I like the cinematography, and the use of lighting and sound track, to set the ominous mood for this film. The dull colors and grey wash of the scenery really helps the spook level of the movie. The one thing I have a real problem with was the animation of Mama's face in the last few scenes. This is supposed to be the height of the horror, the film's climax, but Mama's face is so unrealistic that it pulls me out of my horrified trance and I am no longer scared.My favorite character is Annabell (Jessica Chastain), because she isn't too enthusiastic about suddenly having to take on a motherly role, especially since the girls have serious social problems. Her boyfriend, the main caretaker of the kids, gets seriously injured, leaving Annabell in charge. I love watching her relationship develop into love for Lily and Victoria, and when Mama comes to play, she does a wonderful job showing her fear.My favorite scene is in the very beginning of the movie, when it shows how one-year-old Lily and three-year-old Victoria end up in the woods. It is a very twisted scene, but I like how they show the girls adapting to their new surroundings. They adapt through crayon drawings on the walls, which is very creative.I give Mama 4 out of 5 stars because it is definitely thrilling, but since it is so similar to some other films in this genre, I have to take a point away for lack of originality.

I saw it in the movies several years ago and it was first film in years that made me cry.  It was also a film that made this director famous.  He definitely deserves status of one of the most talented directors.  Soon aferwards he directed one of the Harry Potter movies (the scariest one of them all).  Surely, when I saw his new film ""Mama"" in my local library I had to check it out.This is a film about two young girls whose parents die.  They spend years living in abandoned cottage in the mountains and once they are found everyone is surprised how they managed to survive.  They barely speak, do not walk normally and are intensively protective of each other.  Their only living relative, their father's brother and his live-in girlfriend decide to take care of them and help them adjust to the normal life.But, something if off.  Girls are traumatized and their strange behavior seems to be over the top at times.  As it turns out they have a protector they call Mama who will go to any extreme, no matter how evil to keep girls to herself.  Her love is so jealous that no one is allowed close to girls she considers her own.  I will leave it at this.  You can watch the movie and be the judge of it yourself.  Film has many amazing special effects and scary moments.  But as a fan, I must admit that it is far cry from ""Pan's Labyrinth"".  Del Torro can do better.

Anyone who has been disappointed by recent entries in the genre that turned out to be psychological thrillers instead: here's your movie. Mama starts with the setup: a man (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) who lost his shirt when the stock market crashed goes on a tear and leaves the scene of the crime with his two very young daughters in tow. I don't think I'm spoiling too much to say that he doesn't get very far before meeting a sticky end, but his daughters survive and over the ensuing five years go feral in a forgotten cabin in the woods. Meanwhile, their father's twin brother Luke (also Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) has never stopped looking for them. When they are finally discovered he wants a prominent place in their lives. So does his former sister-in-law, a chilly blonde who sues to win custody and will likely win due to the fact that she is more successful financially than he is. The psychiatrist who has been treating the girls does not want to lose access to them and knows their aunt will take them across the country and out of his reach, so he makes a deal with Luke: he will set Luke and his girlfriend Annabelle (Jessica Chastain) up in the suburbs in exchange for his influencing the outcome of the custody trial. Annabelle is a bassist in a punk rock band and emphatically not interested in motherhood, but she loves Luke so she goes along with the plan. What almost nobody realizes is that the girls were not really alone in the forest, and they are not the only new guests in Luke and Annabelle's new home either. The main suspense is in finding out who or what Mama really is, but there is an added frisson when the viewer realizes (minor spoiler ahead) that the good doctor might know more than he initially let on as well. And there's a humdinger of an emotional wallop as the girls realize that they have to choose because they can't have both Mama and Annabelle in their lives. Mama won't allow it. The special effects are very well done and the acting is well above average for a horror flick.

Yes, it's a kind of ghost story, and perhaps the best I've seen since""Ghost Story."" Those who say it is derivative may feel that way because the tale draws on archetypal images, fears, the kind of history that brings forth both ghosts and our (reluctant) belief in their possible existence. So yes, ghost story, certainly. Again, kind of.But it's much more than that. It's a look at belonging in one world or the next, and raises questions, blurring the line as sweetly and poignantly as del Toro's wonderful ""The Orphange,"" or to a lesser extent, ""The Devil's Backbone."" There is a moment near the end that will refocus the entire film. It's magnificent.At the level of pure cinema, it's beautifully done, with sensitive cinematography and spot-on editing, acting that makes you forget acting, and a character arc in the Jessica Chastain character that is as startling as it is believable. Effects are subtle most of the time. There are scary moments, but always there is that rich campfire feeling of a great fable, a story from early man's deepest and most intimidating questions. It is a tragic tale that rises fully to that difficult status, and then bursts through into something quite different, and very beautiful.In the end, ""Mama"" is a story of love, of rage, of nurturance and danger, of sacrifice, and of mystery. I love what the brother/sister team of Andr&eacute;s and Barbara Muschietti have created, I treasure the clear and pervasive influence of Guillermo del Toro, his ability to dance with such effortless grace between two worlds.

The indoor shots can sometimes be too dark, and it gives one (me at least) a slight feeling of being cheated. But then the darkness is part of the story.If you are on anti-depressants, eat a fistful before watching. I admit there were three points at which I was moved to tears. I won't spoil it for those about to watch. You will know the points when they occur.

The 1s and 2s are most likely from folks who think REAL HORROR is Halloween or Friday the 13th.

The story opened with a man killing his wife and then taking his two small daughters to an abandoned house. He is attacked and killed by a ghost named Mama just as he is getting ready to shoot one of his daughters in the back of the head. The two girls are raised by Mama until they are found five years later. They are cared for by their Uncle Lucas and his reluctant partner Annabel, who has no interest in children. But this is only the beginning. ""Mama"" follows the girls and attacks Lucas, putting him into a coma. This forces Annabel to care for the girls on her own. I won't say anything more about the plot because I don't want to give too much away. I will say that I enjoyed the element of warmth that Annabel (played by Jessica Chastain) brought to the story. I enjoyed seeing how she changed from having little interest in the girls at first, to caring deeply for them and wanting to protect them when the presence of Mama became intensely terrifying and dangerous. The ending was a little strange and I'm not sure I understand it; but that's okay. The film had everything else going for it.

But before he can enact that horror, he is dispatched by some strange, supernatural force residing in the house.

For beneath all the fancy genre trappings - the creaking boards, the creepy voices on the soundtrack, the half-glimpsed figures in the background, the high-tech CGI effects - it's still just the same old hooey about the spirit who simply can't rest until some personal injustice from the past has been rectified and who believes that scaring the bejeezus out of the living will somehow bring that outcome about.Yet, despite a really dopey finale, the scare tactics work reasonably well for most of the duration, and the movie succeeds in developing and sustaining a creepy atmosphere thanks to the direction of Andy Muschietti and the cinematography of Antonio Riestra.

I like stories that are new and different as long as they work. If you add up all the WTH's in this story you just have to laugh at its wacked out storyline and plot holes. If I go into any detail I will spoil the movie for you and I don't want to do that to you. The story is very unique and I will give it credit for that however it is not well thought out nor is it well executed in the movie. Lets just say there is just to many unbelievable WTH moments like some of the characters, story, plot and actions taken by some of the cast. Was this worth the time to watch? Yes. Was it scary? No, but I did get a jump out of one scene that wasn't predictable out of the many many others that were predictable. The cgi was ok, but the figure was a little to cheesy for me along with the many over used body positions and stances. Was it gory? Not at all nor was it very violent or contained any sexual content. The movie does have some good production values like camera work, acting, locations and decent direction, but again the story is just to far out their unless I was watching some kind of fantasy story instead of a horror flick. 2 stars",2,Mama's Family,1374796800,"07 26, 2013",2013,1333,"['Mama', 'story', 'out', 'little', 'different', 'say', 'least', 'when', 'pieces', 'puzzle', 'come', 'together', 'girls', 'life', 'cabin', 'past', 'five', 'years', 'so', 'unbelievable', 'like', 'stories', 'are', 'new', 'different', 'as', 'long', 'work', 'add', 'up', 'WTH', 'story', 'just', 'have', 'laugh', 'wacked', 'out', 'storyline', 'plot', 'holes', 'go', 'detail', 'will', 'spoil', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', 'story', 'very', 'unique', 'will', 'give', 'credit', 'however', 'not', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'well', 'executed', 'movie', 'just', 'say', 'just', 'many', 'unbelievable', 'WTH', 'moments', 'characters', 'story', 'plot', 'actions', 'taken', 'cast', 'Was', 'time', 'watch', 'Yes', 'Was', 'scary', 'No', 'did', 'get', 'jump', 'one', 'scene', 'was', ""n't"", 'predictable', 'many', 'many', 'others', 'were', 'predictable', 'cgi', 'was', 'ok', 'figure', 'was', 'little', 'cheesy', 'many', 'used', 'body', 'positions', 'stances', 'Was', 'gory', 'Not', 'was', 'very', 'violent', 'contained', 'sexual', 'content', 'movie', 'have', 'good', 'production', 'values', 'camera', 'work', 'acting', 'locations', 'decent', 'direction', 'again', 'story', 'just', 'far', 'out', 'was', 'watching', 'kind', 'fantasy', 'story', 'instead', 'horror', 'flick', '2', 'stars']",N/A

1611838,A32Z0G8WC39V0O,B00AIBZLVY,Sexy Bachelor,"[2, 4]","I like it when a director makes some spiritual truisms come to life in artistic, visual settings. At the very least, the script-writers and story-writers spent some time to do a small PART of their homework! I applaud 97% of the points raised in this wonderful movie of motherly love from beyond the grave!First of all, here's 1 scene I did NOT like about this movie: some people in the writing team obviously have an anti-Catholic bias. If they had spent their time reading up on their own Protestant American history (America was never colonised by Catholics but by genocidal Prots who massacred the native American Indians - who, in turn, returned the favour by cursing them!), they would know for a fact that Prots used the violence of state to rip native American Indian children from their parents and forced to live miserably in Protestant boarding ""schools"" which were no better than Communist re-education slave labour camps. WHY does this movie show a Catholic nun being murdered and have men dressed as priests, along with a sheriff, chase an innocent mother through the woods and force her to take her own life? The writers and director could have easily used a SECULAR STATE orphanage in this movie, but no, they just couldn't resist dressing those actors and actresses up as ""Catholics""! IF not for scenes of those pretended Catholic characters, I would have given this movie 5/5 stars!IF the writers of this movie had the common sense to even pick up a Catholic book and the read the history of exorcisms in the Catholic Church, then common sense would tell you that NO real, Catholic clergy would EVER allow such a tragic death of a mother to be conveniently ignored as this movie suggests! The violent hauntings as seen in this movie would NEVER happen IF the dead mother was laid to rest according to Roman Rites! But, of course, who can read the mind of anti-Catholic movie writers? FYI, blame the Prots for today's hauntings in the country. The lead actress' exclamation sums up the broken Prot society of today's America: ""Thank god (sic) I'm NOT pregnant!"" Take a look at scene 1 of this movie on the breakup of the family and the murders - all very Protestant traits from an atheistic Prot American society - lovers of guns, violence and family breakups!OK.... Now's here's what I like about this movie:(1)The ""grounding"" technique used by Annabel the surrogate mother with her youngest adopted child is 100% right. This brief scene reflects reality. The technique will ground and still a Sensitive person who has an over-exposure to the spirit world. When performed by someone who radiates love and care, the technique works in bringing the afflicted person's spirit back into her own natural earthly body.(2)Yes, the Mama character does exists in reality! But, they're very rare on this earth. Don't go finding them out of curiosity. If you display aggression, you the human will be attacked. This is true.(3)Mama is NOT a malicious demon as some would rashly judge her to be. A demon from Hell CANNOT empathise or love a human, much less a human child, let alone raise a child in human chronological time.Mama was / is a human spirit who, in reality, would come back with OTHER entities who in turn would probably do much more damage to living humans.(4)This is a tale of a mother's undying love for her child.The last scene of this movie is most beautifully crafted! I love it!The final fusion and transformation of the characters is totally beautiful and reflects a spiritual reality that cannot be usually expressed in ordinary human words! The writings of Catholic mystics could give you a glimpse of this fusion principle, and to experience it while retaining your own individuality and human Will is not easily describable in ordinary human language. The last scene in this movie reflects a spiritual reality and I absolutely love it! At least, the director got this one spiritual reflection correct!The profoundly AWESOME ending that had sections of the cinema audience APPLAUD in grateful thanks!

There are no giant masked men chasing dopey teens through a forest in MAMA,  Instead this thoughtful and dark (and I mean DARK) drama features the ghost of an uber creepy madwoman who is both terrifying and pitiful, two rather disturbing young girls who love and fear her and, our heroine, a former grunge rock queen who doesn't even like kids.  Go figure.MAMA opens as Lucas, the father of little Victoria and Lily (darling little girls, these two), a banker with money and marriage troubles, kills his colleagues and wife, then takes the girls into what looks like the frozen tundra, all in order to kill them, then himself.  After his car skids off of a mountain road, the trio find a deserted cabin (filled with what looks like really fabulous vintage furniture).  Dad pulls a pistol out to dispense with the older of the girls, Victoria (around 5 years old or so).  As he shakily aims, a dark, floating presence grabs and kills him.  Victoria and her little sister Lily (around 2 I'd say) are left alone in this creepy cabin.  Well not alone. They've got Mama to care for them, and over the next five years this skinny, angular ghoulish figure feeds the girls cherries (I have no idea why, aside from the fact that cherries are known as the ""Devils Fruit"") and cares for them as only a ghost can.  That is to say, not really at all.The girls, when finally found by their Dad's brother, are as feral as cats, filthy and scampering about the cabin in a very odd manner. Not since Regan spider-walked down the stairs in THE EXORCIST have children looked so darned disturbing moving about on all fours.  The girls are moved to a psychiatric facility in preparation for placement with their uncle Jeffrey and his girlfriend Annabelle. And guess who comes along for the ride.Jessica Chastain plays Annabelle (and by the way, is there any better young actress out there right now?  Chastain is just marvelous in everything, including MAMA), main squeeze of Uncle Jeffrey.  With her Joan Jett black shag and tattoo sleeves, Annabelle is not a motherly figure, in fact the film opens as she thanks her lucky stars that a pregnancy test she has just taken is negative.  But because she loves Jeffrey, Annabelle  give motherhood the old college try, although mothering these two very messed up young girls, now 6 and 11, would challenge Mother Goose herself.  Unfortunately Mama takes poor Uncle Jeffrey out as soon as the new family moves in together, and as he lies in a coma, Annabelle is left to deal with the girls and their ghostly savior, who is also more than a little jealous.Tied up in this nightmare is the girls psychiatrist, who pretends to have their welfare at heart but is actually searching for proof of the paranormal, as well as another relative, an Aunt who doesn't think Jeff and Annabelle have what it takes to parent these poor little nutcases.  Lily in particular is disturbed past the point of redemption.  To her, Mama is a real parent, far more real than Jeffrey and Annabelle, and Lily cannot make the jump to any kind of normal childlike behavior, continuing to eat weird stuff (mostly moths!) and play with a gibbering, cavorting (and jointless, it seems) MAMA, who is seen peeking out of the closet, from under the bed, or just about anywhere that will really, really scare you.  Victoria, who was able to retain some language skills and has at least some memory of an ordered life, is more adaptable, and as she becomes closer to Annabelle, becomes ever more fearful of Mama's jealous rages.The film travels to the logical conclusion of a horror film of this sort, the final fight between Mama and Annabelle for the lives of the children.  And even though the ending is, for the most part, predictable, the journey is so darkly told, so evocative and creepy that MAMA will play around the corners and edges of your memory long after watching it.  This is a horror story of the first degree, with lots of jump in your seat scares and plenty of hold your breath moments.  I loved it!I'd recommend watching MAMA a few times.  I had to, because the first time I sat through it I was so darned terrified that more than half of the movie went unwatched (my eyes were closed and my fingers were in my ears).  There are lots of interesting little tidbits that only become apparent upon the second or even third viewing.  For example, watch the vignette of the drawings that the girls make that takes place under the opening titles.  It will give you some great insight as to how the girls lived in the forest those five years (what's up with those dead raccoons?).  The cherry thing is never explained (the mountain of cherry pits in the cabin is just plain weird), but you'll understand MAMA better if you can watch it without putting your hands over your eyes.This is a definite five star movie, in my humble opinion.  I love a good horror film, but really good ones are few and far between.  MAMA is everything a great horror flick should be.  Well crafted, interesting and most importantly, scarier than s***!  Watch it in the dark, with someone you love.

1611865,ALJLONJXLA3OQ,B00AIBZLVY,The People's Critic,"[0, 2]","Mama (an excuse to critically discuss horror)The horror genre has an unusual history in the cinematic world. Unlike traditional genres like comedy and drama, horror films seem aimed at a slightly more specialized market. And yet, with this specialized market, one would expect more diversity in the content, but history has revealed that this is not the case. Studios that release horror films seem to pray on popular cultural fads and then, most likely due to inexpensive production costs, let loose clone after clone after clone until these films eventually become less lucrative. Take a look at how many films follow this storyline: a mother notices some strange behavior in her child or around the house. She tells her husband, but her pleas fall on deaf ears; she must simply be imagining the pots and pans all stacking themselves all over the kitchen. Eventually, the husband witnesses something he can't explain and (hesitantly) agrees to contact an expert or specialist in strange behavior who is found on the Internet. Chaos ensues. The expert dies trying to help, one or more friends of the protagonist become victims, and it ends right where it started with a tiny difference that ties everything together. This form of formulaic market saturation as a business model may keep the genre alive, but it has also lessened its reputation. There's no doubt that horror films have the potential to affect an audience more than any other type of film since audience reaction is basically the watermark for success (consider those film trailers that do not show clips of the film, but rather show a packed, darkened theater of people wildly reacting to some outrageously scary moment).Now, I am actually a horror fan and will concede that some of the greatest films are horror films (The Sixth Sense, The Exorcist, Frailty - look it up-, Jaws). However, the worst film of nearly every year is also a horror film (intentionally or unintentionally). Consequently, I am always wary of cinema that resists progress to idly make money off of spent franchises that are too cheap, production-wise, to give up. They make you want to cry for your...Mama is the latest demented fable loosely attached to Guillermo del Toro, regardless of the relentless name dropping that advertisements display. Del Toro did produce, but his influence ends there, and thus, Mama is not Pan's Labyrinth. Mama begins with a catastrophic series of events that result in two young girls being abandoned in a strange cottage in the woods where they will live for five years before being discovered. Exposition sweeps us through a bizarrely simplified adoption process where the girls' uncle, Lucas (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) is permitted to raise the girls in a state funded research house in order for the girls to be continuously observed by a psychologist. At this point, most of the stereotypical formula laid out previously proceeds.Mama is written and directed by Andres Muschietti who bases it off of his own short film, also called Mama. Fundamentally, the story is not incredibly strong, and leaves the viewer with some noteworthy qualms, but Muschietti clearly understands where the few strengths of his story exist and manages to create a couple good scares. Additionally, he adds some fresh complexity to the film by writing Lucas's girlfriend, Annabel (Jessica Chastain), as a bass guitarist in a punk band who is apprehensive about having children and settling into a housewife role, but suddenly finds herself doing both. Muschietti also makes another honorable choice in that he tells a ghost story where the revelation of the ghost itself is not the object of the film. He, instead, introduces the ghost early and uses it as his chief form of tension building; that and the kids. The kids are creepy.Mama is what it is. It raises no bars, but it holds a reasonably heavy one somewhat steadily in place. Expect the upcoming months to offer at least four more ""clones"" of this film as this fad works its way out. Then it should be smooth sailing... until it all starts over again in September.

Starring Jessica Chastain and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Mama tells the story of two young sisters left alone to fend for themselves in a small cabin in the woods.  They're found there five years later having apparently survived on only cherries and the love of a violent ghost.  Plucked and transplanted into the home of their father's twin brother, Mama follows.I had a blast watching this film for the first eighty minutes.  It offers a solid nod to the classic ghost story and does so effectively.  I jumped in my seat a few times and I haven't had that happen in a LONG time.  It made for a fun experience and for that reason alone, I recommend at least renting the film - the bulk of it is worth a ride.But the last twenty minutes didn't do it for me.  Dramatic and a bit cheesy, it just felt awkward and that made me sad.  The ghost started getting more screen time and the longer she flew around, the more attention was given to her facial expressions, movements.  CGI started taking over at that point and it was too much.  Not that I'd have ever been fooled into thinking they cast a real ghost for the part, but it was overwhelmingly fake and difficult to parry aside.  This, for me, rapidly depleted the suspense from Mama.  And it had such momentum!The director seemed to take some inspirations from Japanese ghost horror and when it worked, he went yard.  But it seemed like he tried to build UP from that recipe and, in my amateur opinion, he'd have done well to keep it simple.  Everything from the black spreads on the walls with moths popping out to the hair flowing across the floors were genuinely creepy, but after that, I couldn't hang on.  Still, as I said before, most of Mama is done really well and I'm looking forward to Muschietti's future work - he's clearly talented.As for the performance nuts and bolts of the movie, the children were cast well, Coster-Waldau was a win, and Jessica Chastain saved the day.  I think the scene movement here was clunky from scene-to-scene, rushed, and these folks did a wonderful job keeping everything glued together.  Especially Chastain.  She's worth watching here and I'll be following her career because of it.  Good stuff.But again, I'd recommend renting this before committing to owning it.  Guillermo del Toro is the executive producer for the film, not the director, and I think the fact is notable.Thank you for your time.- t",3,Mostly effective.,1369612800,"05 27, 2013",2013,2467,"['Mama', '2013', 'supernatural/horror', 'film', 'directed', 'Andres', 'Muschietti', 'Starring', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'Nikolaj', 'Coster-Waldau', 'Mama', 'story', 'two', 'young', 'sisters', 'left', 'alone', 'fend', 'small', 'cabin', 'woods', ""'re"", 'found', 'there', 'five', 'years', 'later', 'having', 'apparently', 'survived', 'only', 'cherries', 'love', 'violent', 'ghost', 'Plucked', 'transplanted', 'home', 'father', 'twin', 'brother', 'Mama', 'follows.I', 'had', 'blast', 'watching', 'film', 'first', 'eighty', 'minutes', 'solid', 'nod', 'classic', 'ghost', 'story', 'so', 'effectively', 'jumped', 'seat', 'few', 'times', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'happen', 'LONG', 'time', 'made', 'fun', 'experience', 'reason', 'alone', 'recommend', 'least', 'renting', 'film', 'bulk', 'ride.But', 'last', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'Dramatic', 'bit', 'cheesy', 'just', 'felt', 'awkward', 'made', 'sad', 'ghost', 'started', 'getting', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'longer', 'flew', 'around', 'more', 'attention', 'was', 'given', 'facial', 'expressions', 'movements', 'CGI', 'started', 'taking', 'over', 'point', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'Not', ""'d"", 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'fooled', 'thinking', 'cast', 'real', 'ghost', 'part', 'was', 'overwhelmingly', 'fake', 'difficult', 'parry', 'aside', 'rapidly', 'depleted', 'suspense', 'Mama', 'had', 'such', 'momentum', 'director', 'seemed', 'take', 'inspirations', 'Japanese', 'ghost', 'horror', 'when', 'worked', 'went', 'yard', 'seemed', 'tried', 'build', 'UP', 'recipe', 'amateur', 'opinion', ""'d"", 'have', 'done', 'well', 'keep', 'simple', 'Everything', 'black', 'spreads', 'walls', 'moths', 'popping', 'hair', 'flowing', 'floors', 'were', 'genuinely', 'creepy', 'could', ""n't"", 'hang', 'Still', 'said', 'most', 'Mama', 'done', 'really', 'well', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'Muschietti', 'future', 'work', 'clearly', 'talented.As', 'performance', 'nuts', 'bolts', 'movie', 'children', 'were', 'cast', 'well', 'Coster-Waldau', 'was', 'win', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'saved', 'day', 'think', 'scene', 'movement', 'here', 'was', 'clunky', 'scene-to-scene', 'rushed', 'folks', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'keeping', 'everything', 'glued', 'together', 'Especially', 'Chastain', 'worth', 'watching', 'here', ""'ll"", 'be', 'following', 'career', 'Good', 'stuff.But', 'again', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'renting', 'committing', 'owning', 'Guillermo', 'del', 'Toro', 'executive', 'producer', 'film', 'not', 'director', 'think', 'fact', 'notable.Thank', 'time.-', 't']",N/A

Under the guidence of Guillermo Del ToroThe fact is that although ""Mama"" was sold as a horror film, it's more of a thriller with lots of jump scares and atmosphere to spare. What works in ""Mama"" works well-- Jessica Chastian and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau both give exceptional performances with Chastian doing an outstanding job in a very different role for her to date.Equally notable are the children ( Megan Charpentier and Isabelle N&eacute;lisse) acting in the film who give very natural performances that help ""sell"" the film. ""Mama"" manages to transcend the predictability that creeps into the second half of the film much like the creature of the title of the film.Writer/director Andr&eacute;s Muschietti does a good job on his first feature film which shows a strong influence of Guillermo Del Toro who produced the film.SPOILERS:Two little girls are stranded after their father (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau in a dual role) kills their mother and goes on the run. The girls are left in a deserted cabin in the middle of winter where they are cared for by a dark creature they refer to as ""Mama"".Five years past and when their uncle (Coster-Waldau)discovers their whereabouts, he is determined that he and his girlfriend (Chastian)will adopt the two girls. Both, however, became feral while on their own and when they move into a new home (observed by a psychatrist), they bring something back with them.END OF SPOILERS:The blu-ray transfer looks quite nice with rich, deep blacks and terrific detail. The audio mix is also exceptionally good.The special features include a commentary track by Andr&eacute;s Muschietti and his sister co-writer/producer Barbara Muschietti. It's a decent commentary track although the pair often describe the scene we're watching.We also get the very effective five minute short that caught co-producer Del Toro's eye (he also provides an introduction)and is echoed with a different outcome in the feature.We also get a 10 minute featurette on the production of the film ""The Birth of Mama"" as well as Matriarchal Secrets: The Visual Effects of Mama a short (six minutes)featurette on the visual effects.We also get eight deleted scenes with an optional commentary track.We also get a DVD as well as an Ultraviolet streaming or itunes download (""from select retailers"" not sure what that means but it's mentioned on the box).""Mama"" starts off promising and is an enjoyable ride but becomes predictable by the last half of the film.  Still, ""Mama"" IS worth watching and suggests considerable promise for the Mushietti team.3 1/2 stars",3,"Blu-ray review: Be thankful the creature in this film isn't your ""Mama""-entertaining thriller",1368316800,"05 12, 2013",2013,2766,"['Visually', 'stunning', 'looking', 'Mama', 'pretty', 'good', 'thriller', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'much', 'more', 'effective', 'horror', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'rated', 'R', 'giving', 'director', 'free', 'reign', 'make', 'scarier', 'horror', 'film', 'guidence', 'Guillermo', 'Del', 'ToroThe', 'fact', 'Mama', 'was', 'sold', 'horror', 'film', 'more', 'thriller', 'lots', 'jump', 'scares', 'atmosphere', 'spare', 'What', 'Mama', 'well', 'Jessica', 'Chastian', 'Nikolaj', 'Coster-Waldau', 'give', 'exceptional', 'performances', 'Chastian', 'doing', 'outstanding', 'job', 'very', 'different', 'role', 'date.Equally', 'notable', 'are', 'children', 'Megan', 'Charpentier', 'Isabelle', 'N', 'eacute', 'acting', 'film', 'who', 'give', 'very', 'natural', 'performances', 'help', 'sell', 'film', 'Mama', 'transcend', 'predictability', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'much', 'creature', 'title', 'film.Writer/director', 'Andr', 'eacute', 'Muschietti', 'good', 'job', 'first', 'feature', 'film', 'strong', 'influence', 'Guillermo', 'Del', 'Toro', 'who', 'produced', 'film.SPOILERS', 'Two', 'little', 'girls', 'are', 'stranded', 'father', 'Nikolaj', 'Coster-Waldau', 'dual', 'role', 'mother', 'run', 'girls', 'are', 'left', 'deserted', 'cabin', 'middle', 'winter', 'where', 'are', 'cared', 'dark', 'creature', 'refer', 'Mama', '.Five', 'years', 'past', 'when', 'uncle', 'Coster-Waldau', 'whereabouts', 'determined', 'girlfriend', 'Chastian', 'will', 'adopt', 'two', 'girls', 'however', 'became', 'feral', 'own', 'when', 'move', 'new', 'home', 'observed', 'psychatrist', 'bring', 'something', 'back', 'them.END', 'SPOILERS', 'blu-ray', 'transfer', 'quite', 'nice', 'rich', 'deep', 'blacks', 'terrific', 'detail', 'audio', 'mix', 'also', 'exceptionally', 'good.The', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'commentary', 'track', 'Andr', 'eacute', 'Muschietti', 'sister', 'co-writer/producer', 'Barbara', 'Muschietti', 'decent', 'commentary', 'track', 'pair', 'often', 'scene', ""'re"", 'watching.We', 'also', 'get', 'very', 'effective', 'five', 'minute', 'short', 'caught', 'co-producer', 'Del', 'Toro', 'eye', 'also', 'introduction', 'echoed', 'different', 'outcome', 'feature.We', 'also', 'get', '10', 'minute', 'featurette', 'production', 'film', 'Birth', 'Mama', 'as', 'well', 'Matriarchal', 'Secrets', 'Visual', 'Effects', 'Mama', 'short', 'six', 'minutes', 'featurette', 'visual', 'effects.We', 'also', 'get', 'eight', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'optional', 'commentary', 'track.We', 'also', 'get', 'DVD', 'as', 'well', 'Ultraviolet', 'streaming', 'itunes', 'download', 'select', 'retailers', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'mentioned', 'box', 'Mama', 'promising', 'enjoyable', 'ride', 'predictable', 'last', 'half', 'film', 'Still', 'Mama', 'IS', 'worth', 'watching', 'considerable', 'promise', 'Mushietti', 'team.3', '1/2', 'stars']",N/A

So it is a mixed bag to review, because I could have given everything from one to five stars. First: I don't understand (like I didn't back in the day when ""Don't be afraid of the dark"" came out)why a guy like del Toro as an exec. producer always let the directors give away the look of the monster or mosnters at the first possible moment. Especially in Mama it would have served the movie well, if you would have seen a lot less of the entity of it's titel, which would have hightened the suspens and terror a lot. Second: What kind of ending was this??? There where two or three possible endnings hidden in the subplots, but neither was chosen to give the film a decent ending, but maybe that's the problem if you have 5 guys writing a screenplay that at the end no one knows anymore how to bring the movie to a satisfying conclusion for the audience.

This however would be fine if the source of the fear was something to behold in terror and could remain so after the reveal, but if we don't 'believe' in it, it has lost it's direction and our attention.However, the overall setting and shots in the film, combined with good acting, allows for an enjoyable horror, just don't take it too seriously.

The film itself has beautiful yet eerie cinematography with a muted bleak palette that reinforces the dark themes in the film. At the heart of the story are two sisters, Victoria and her younger sister Lilly who after five years of being missing are discovered in a dilapidated cabin in the woods in a remote area. The sisters are brought to live with their uncle, Lucas (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau better known for his role as Jaime Lannister in Game of Thrones)and his girlfriend, Annabel (Jessica Chastain). The psychiatrist assigned to the girls' case (Victoria is about 8 and Lilly is about 5 or 6) insists that the 'family' move into a home owned by his clinic and in exchange the psychiatrist, Dr. Gerald Dreyfuss (Daniel Kash) commits to supporting Lucas' claims in a custody battle with the girls' great-aunt Jean (Jane Moffat). The young girls indicate a bond with something they call ""Mama"", which Dreyfuss initially dismisses as a coping mechanism rather than anything real.Before long, it becomes apparent that all is not well with the new family unit. The entity that had been caring for the girls at the cabin in the woods has followed the sisters to their new home and feels threatened when it perceives the girls are bonding with Lucas and Annabel, particularly Victoria, the older sibling. An attack by the malevolent entity leads to Lucas ending up in hospital, and Annabel is left to shoulder the burden of caring for the girls by herself. Gradually, over a series of interviews, Dr. Dreyfuss is able to uncover the mystery behind ""Mama"", going back in time through history to the 1800s where a tragedy unfolded involving a young, mentally unstable woman who is so consumed by rage when her baby is torn away from her.Though not without its flaws, I found myself quite immersed in the storyline throughout the film. The main actors deliver credible performances though both Coster-Waldau and Chastain were not really able to exercise their acting talents to their full potential here, due to the limitations of the script. Chastain's performance here is actually a bit tepid, and I thought the actor portraying Victoria did a much better job emoting and conveying her dilemma and horror. The CGI effects were great and conveyed the deep sense of horror unfolding on screen.I would recommend this movie for fans of atmospheric horror movies with jump in your seat moments!",4,Chilling tale of maternal love beyond the grave,1370476800,"06 6, 2013",2013,2621,"['friend', 'brother', 'recommended', 'Mama', 'knowing', 'how', 'much', 'appreciate', 'good', 'horror', 'movie', 'so', 'finally', 'decided', 'watch', 'last', 'night', 'insisting', 'husband', 'watched', 'heard', 'movie', 'had', 'plenty', 'scares', 'film', 'beautiful', 'yet', 'eerie', 'cinematography', 'muted', 'bleak', 'palette', 'dark', 'themes', 'film', 'heart', 'story', 'are', 'two', 'sisters', 'Victoria', 'younger', 'sister', 'Lilly', 'who', 'five', 'years', 'being', 'missing', 'are', 'discovered', 'dilapidated', 'cabin', 'woods', 'remote', 'area', 'sisters', 'are', 'brought', 'live', 'uncle', 'Lucas', 'Nikolaj', 'Coster-Waldau', 'better', 'known', 'role', 'Jaime', 'Lannister', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'girlfriend', 'Annabel', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'psychiatrist', 'assigned', 'girls', 'case', 'Victoria', '8', 'Lilly', '5', '6', ""'family"", 'move', 'home', 'owned', 'clinic', 'exchange', 'psychiatrist', 'Dr.', 'Gerald', 'Dreyfuss', 'Daniel', 'Kash', 'supporting', 'Lucas', 'claims', 'custody', 'battle', 'girls', 'great-aunt', 'Jean', 'Jane', 'Moffat', 'young', 'girls', 'indicate', 'bond', 'something', 'call', 'Mama', 'Dreyfuss', 'initially', 'coping', 'mechanism', 'rather', 'anything', 'real.Before', 'long', 'apparent', 'not', 'well', 'new', 'family', 'unit', 'entity', 'had', 'been', 'caring', 'girls', 'cabin', 'woods', 'followed', 'sisters', 'new', 'home', 'feels', 'threatened', 'when', 'girls', 'are', 'bonding', 'Lucas', 'Annabel', 'particularly', 'Victoria', 'older', 'sibling', 'attack', 'malevolent', 'entity', 'Lucas', 'ending', 'up', 'hospital', 'Annabel', 'left', 'shoulder', 'burden', 'caring', 'girls', 'Gradually', 'series', 'interviews', 'Dr.', 'Dreyfuss', 'able', 'uncover', 'mystery', 'Mama', 'going', 'back', 'time', 'history', '1800s', 'where', 'tragedy', 'unfolded', 'involving', 'young', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'woman', 'who', 'so', 'consumed', 'rage', 'when', 'baby', 'torn', 'away', 'her.Though', 'not', 'flaws', 'found', 'quite', 'immersed', 'storyline', 'film', 'main', 'actors', 'deliver', 'credible', 'performances', 'Coster-Waldau', 'Chastain', 'were', 'not', 'really', 'able', 'exercise', 'acting', 'talents', 'full', 'potential', 'here', 'due', 'limitations', 'script', 'Chastain', 'performance', 'here', 'actually', 'bit', 'tepid', 'thought', 'actor', 'portraying', 'Victoria', 'did', 'much', 'better', 'job', 'emoting', 'conveying', 'dilemma', 'horror', 'CGI', 'effects', 'were', 'great', 'conveyed', 'deep', 'sense', 'horror', 'unfolding', 'screen.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'fans', 'atmospheric', 'horror', 'movies', 'jump', 'seat', 'moments']",N/A
