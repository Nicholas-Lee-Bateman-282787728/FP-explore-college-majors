170700,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,1415723702,A Customer,"[31, 35]","Totally formulaic and with such an outrageous premise that it's almost impossible to take seriously, Failure to Launch is mostly saved by the charisma of its all star cast, particularly the attractive supporting players who garner most of the film's few laughs. It's a movie that constantly hovers around sit-com territory, even though somewhere in the depths of its mediocrity it presents a very real and disturbing issue - the phenomenon of thirty something males, or ""boy men"" who still like to live at home with their parentsMathew McConaughey is Trip, a commitment-phobic 35-year-old whose ""failure to launch"" means he's still living with his parents in their tidy suburban home, enjoying Mom's egg and pancake breakfasts whilst she contentedly does his washing and tidies his room.  Trip is a charming all round nice guy, who sells luxury yachts for a living, but he's also spoilt and somewhat sheltered and he can't keep a girlfriend because they freak out every time he brings them home to meet the parents.Apparently there exists a profession for women whose job it is to inveigle and seduce these adolescent male adults from the nest - yes it's really true! Sarah Jessica Parker plays Paula, one such ""consultant,"" who fell into the profession a few years earlier when she failed to disentangle herself from a beau from his mom and dad's house. Paula's been hired by Trip's parents - a capricious Kathy Bates and a laidback Terry Bradshaw - to seduce Trip on the assumption his newborn passion will motivate him to grow up and leave home.No surprises here - it's boy meets girl and accidentally fall in love, boy and girl have a misunderstanding and then eventually come together again. And I'm still not sure whether Trip ever actually moved out of home - maybe he ended up buying the boat! McConaughey and Parker have a great deal of chemistry together, and Parker is always fun to watch, but they are constantly left high and dry with thanklessly predictable scenes.Zooey Deschanel is, as usual, a standout as Paula's sardonic, possibly manic-depressive roommate, her brand of humor is impossibly dry and she turns the character into a wonderful comic foil. Tripp's only friends, Ace (Justin Bartha) and Demo (Bradley Cooper), also are stay-at-homers and provide some welcome eye candy to the proceedings, especially up-and-coming actor Bradley Cooper.  Failure to Launch is pretty much a movie of comic stupidity and distractions, basically aiming for the lowest common denominator in entertainment.Along with a bunch of stupid - but admittedly cute  - pet tricks, the characters play paintball games, go sailing and then rock climbing, they eat lunch in fish restaurants and have silly, petty arguments  - there's a real sense of desperation with the writers here - anything to build a false sense of forward thrust into a story that is predictably dead on arrival.

170705,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,1415723702,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 5]","If ever a films title should persuade you to walk in the other direction, `Failure to Launch' is truly telling.  I am so tempted to give this an `F' and be done with it, but I find that there is at least one redeeming factor in this big pile of unrealistic, clich&eacute;d garbage; the stars.  Yes, no matter how ridiculous and unintelligible and utterly preposterous this lazy mess of a film really is, each and every actor involved does all they can to make it watchable.So, for you Zooey, Matthew, Kathy and Jessica; I give this horrible film a D.The film revolves around Paula, a professional motivator who is hired by Al and Sue, parents of man-child Tripp.  Tripp is approaching his middle-age years and he has yet to move out of the house; causing his parents to resort to Paula as a way to get him out the door.  Of course, as you probably could have guessed, Paula falls in love with Tripp, Tripp finds out that she is scamming him and breaks things off, everyone's life falls apart and then they make up and things are happy again.  The issue I have with the film isn't the formula, because it's become apparent that there really is no other formula available to screenwriters today.  My issue is the reckless abandon with which the screenwriters chose to formulate the formula.  It's just very mediocre, and when it tries to be original (there are far too many animals here) it winds up being so preposterous that it is almost insulting to the audience.Thank God Almighty for the charm and comedic timing of Zooey Deschanel and Sarah Jessica Parker.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, Matthew McConaughey does his usual schtick and looks `super hot' (according to my wife) and so bonus points for him or whatever, but really this movie is not about him.  No, if it wasn't for Parker's undeniable charm and comedic chemistry or Deschanel's flawless timing and sensual draw this movie would have been a complete waste for me.Kathy Bates is generally good in everything, so bonus points for that.In the end though, I hate to say that I cannot recommend this movie to anyone.  In fact, when anyone I know that has seen this finds out that I've seen it they roll their eyes and ask why I didn't turn it off before it started; it is that bad.  There is nothing new, nothing remotely memorable and nothing that warrants repeated viewing at all.  I love you Zooey, and you really worked your cute little buns off to make me enjoy every moment you were on screen; but even your quirky charm cannot save this disgrace from my trash bin.Seeing her made me realize that I NEED to get to the movies and see `(500) Days of Summer' though!",2,This film fails at just about everything...,1247788800,"07 17, 2009",2009,2619,"['ever', 'films', 'title', 'should', 'persuade', 'walk', 'other', 'direction', 'Failure', 'Launch', 'truly', 'telling', 'am', 'so', 'tempted', 'give', 'F', 'be', 'done', 'find', 'least', 'one', 'redeeming', 'factor', 'big', 'pile', 'unrealistic', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'garbage', 'stars', 'Yes', 'matter', 'how', 'ridiculous', 'unintelligible', 'utterly', 'preposterous', 'lazy', 'mess', 'film', 'really', 'actor', 'involved', 'can', 'make', 'watchable.So', 'Zooey', 'Matthew', 'Kathy', 'Jessica', 'give', 'horrible', 'film', 'D.The', 'film', 'revolves', 'Paula', 'professional', 'motivator', 'who', 'hired', 'Al', 'Sue', 'parents', 'man-child', 'Tripp', 'Tripp', 'approaching', 'middle-age', 'years', 'yet', 'move', 'house', 'causing', 'parents', 'resort', 'Paula', 'way', 'get', 'out', 'door', 'course', 'probably', 'could', 'have', 'guessed', 'Paula', 'love', 'Tripp', 'Tripp', 'out', 'scamming', 'breaks', 'things', 'off', 'everyone', 'life', 'apart', 'then', 'make', 'up', 'things', 'are', 'happy', 'again', 'issue', 'have', 'film', ""n't"", 'formula', 'become', 'apparent', 'really', 'other', 'formula', 'available', 'screenwriters', 'today', 'issue', 'reckless', 'abandon', 'screenwriters', 'chose', 'formulate', 'formula', 'just', 'very', 'mediocre', 'when', 'be', 'original', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'animals', 'here', 'up', 'being', 'so', 'preposterous', 'almost', 'insulting', 'audience.Thank', 'God', 'Almighty', 'charm', 'comedic', 'timing', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'Yeah', 'yeah', 'yeah', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'usual', 'schtick', 'super', 'hot', 'according', 'wife', 'so', 'bonus', 'points', 'whatever', 'really', 'movie', 'not', 'No', 'was', ""n't"", 'Parker', 'undeniable', 'charm', 'comedic', 'chemistry', 'Deschanel', 'flawless', 'timing', 'sensual', 'draw', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'complete', 'waste', 'me.Kathy', 'Bates', 'generally', 'good', 'everything', 'so', 'bonus', 'points', 'that.In', 'end', 'hate', 'say', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'fact', 'when', 'anyone', 'know', 'seen', 'out', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'roll', 'eyes', 'ask', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'turn', 'off', 'started', 'bad', 'nothing', 'new', 'nothing', 'remotely', 'memorable', 'nothing', 'warrants', 'repeated', 'viewing', 'love', 'Zooey', 'really', 'worked', 'cute', 'little', 'buns', 'make', 'enjoy', 'moment', 'were', 'screen', 'even', 'quirky', 'charm', 'can', 'not', 'save', 'disgrace', 'trash', 'bin.Seeing', 'made', 'realize', 'NEED', 'get', 'movies', 'see', '500', 'Days', 'Summer', 'though']",N/A

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[3, 4]","Tripp (Matthew McConaughey, TWO FOR THE MONEY) is a 35-year-old that still lives with his parents ...and they're sick of it. Unable to talk directly with Tripp about it, the parents hire Paula (Sarah Jessica Parker, THE FAMILY STONE), a professional motivator who assists families in ousting adult kids from parents' homes. But troubles quickly surface as Paula discovers that Tripp doesn't fit her usual profile. He's charming, has a great job, and is excessively good-looking. Changes in Paula's normal tactics are integrated only to come apart as she finds herself falling for Tripp.The ridiculous script and cast really give this film the umpf! it needed for success. It's surprising how enjoyable the movie is despite its light tone.Kathy Bates (MISERY) stars as Tripp's mother, aiding in her son's inability to move out by cleaning up after every mess he makes, doing his laundry, and fixing him scrumptious meals. Ex-quarterback Terry Bradshaw does a shockingly great job as Tripp's father, a distant man with a penchant for nudity (his own).McConaughey and Parker have great chemistry together, but if there's one person who stole the show it was Paula's roommate, Kit (Zooey Deschanel, THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY), a tough-talking tomboy who's lack of sleep thanks to a Mockingbird outside her bedroom window makes for some of the more hilarious moments in the film (think avian CPR including beak-to-mouth resuscitation!)The other thing that makes this light comedy so enjoyable was that it wasn't a chick-flick, like most romantic comedies. This one is more of a guy-flick. We all know someone who knows someone who has an adult child (usually a guy) still living in their home, right?The running gags on animal attacks against McConaughey's character are laugh-out-loud fun. And his two best friends, Ace (Justin Bartha, NATIONAL TREASURE) and Demo (Bradley Cooper, ALIAS), who also happen to be mommas boys living at home, have some excellent moments on film.This flick was a pleasant surprise. It's not going to increase your intellect in any way, but it certainly is a laugh-a-minute movie.(Things for football fans to watch out for: 1) Terry Bradshaw takes a young boy out of the house towards the end of the film and tells him, ""I'll teach you how to ice your shoulders."" 2) When the young boy and McConaughey are playing a football Playstation game, pay attention to the teams).",4,When Animals Attack ...Something Unnatural is Going On!,1155340800,"08 12, 2006",2006,2406,"['Tripp', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'TWO', 'THE', 'MONEY', '35-year-old', 'still', 'parents', ""'re"", 'sick', 'Unable', 'talk', 'directly', 'Tripp', 'parents', 'hire', 'Paula', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'THE', 'FAMILY', 'STONE', 'professional', 'motivator', 'who', 'families', 'ousting', 'adult', 'kids', 'parents', 'homes', 'troubles', 'quickly', 'surface', 'Paula', 'Tripp', ""n't"", 'fit', 'usual', 'profile', 'charming', 'great', 'job', 'excessively', 'good-looking', 'Changes', 'Paula', 'normal', 'tactics', 'are', 'integrated', 'only', 'come', 'apart', 'falling', 'Tripp.The', 'ridiculous', 'script', 'cast', 'really', 'give', 'film', 'umpf', 'needed', 'success', 'surprising', 'how', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'light', 'tone.Kathy', 'Bates', 'MISERY', 'Tripp', 'mother', 'aiding', 'son', 'inability', 'move', 'out', 'cleaning', 'up', 'mess', 'doing', 'laundry', 'fixing', 'scrumptious', 'meals', 'Ex-quarterback', 'Terry', 'Bradshaw', 'shockingly', 'great', 'job', 'Tripp', 'father', 'distant', 'man', 'penchant', 'nudity', 'own', '.McConaughey', 'Parker', 'have', 'great', 'chemistry', 'together', 'one', 'person', 'who', 'stole', 'show', 'was', 'Paula', 'roommate', 'Kit', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'THE', 'HITCHHIKER', 'GUIDE', 'TO', 'THE', 'GALAXY', 'tough-talking', 'tomboy', 'who', 'lack', 'sleep', 'thanks', 'Mockingbird', 'bedroom', 'window', 'more', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'film', 'think', 'avian', 'CPR', 'including', 'beak-to-mouth', 'resuscitation', 'other', 'thing', 'light', 'comedy', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'chick-flick', 'most', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'one', 'more', 'guy-flick', 'know', 'someone', 'who', 'someone', 'who', 'adult', 'child', 'usually', 'guy', 'still', 'living', 'home', 'right', 'running', 'gags', 'animal', 'attacks', 'McConaughey', 'character', 'are', 'laugh-out-loud', 'fun', 'two', 'best', 'friends', 'Ace', 'Justin', 'Bartha', 'NATIONAL', 'TREASURE', 'Demo', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'ALIAS', 'who', 'also', 'happen', 'be', 'mommas', 'boys', 'living', 'home', 'have', 'excellent', 'moments', 'film.This', 'flick', 'was', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'not', 'going', 'increase', 'intellect', 'way', 'certainly', 'laugh-a-minute', 'movie', 'Things', 'football', 'fans', 'watch', 'out', '1', 'Terry', 'Bradshaw', 'young', 'boy', 'house', 'end', 'film', ""'ll"", 'teach', 'how', 'ice', 'shoulders', '2', 'When', 'young', 'boy', 'McConaughey', 'are', 'playing', 'football', 'Playstation', 'game', 'pay', 'attention', 'teams']",N/A

Almost everything in this film was recycled from other films and that really hurts the outcome if you think too much about it. But if you take it on face value you are bound to enjoy it much more.

The directing is alright but since Tom Dey is still in action comedy mode after ""Showtime"" he tends to make some of the sports sequences look like action sequences, which was a bit odd. The one scene that I ejnoyed but was shot like an action sequence was the paintball game, it was very entertaining watching Sarah Jessica Parker scream and crawling on the ground running away from big men with paintball guns. And the thing that works best is the cast. Everyone was perfectly cast. ""Failure to Launch"" is one of the best cast movies I have seen in a while. The best thing about this film is Zooey Deschanel.

The only problem is...it isn't his. Tripp lives with his parents (Kathy Bates and Terry Bradshaw) and he's a mama's boy. Between eating the pancake breakfasts his mom makes for him each morning and putting away the clothes that she washes and folds for him, there isn't much to convince him to leave home. Why should he? He's got it made.Until his parents decide they've had enough. Time for Tripp to take a trip and fly from the nest, so to speak. After meeting with some friends, Tripp's parents decide to hire Paula (Sarah Jessica Parker), an intervention guru. She comes up with a plan that is sure to make Tripp `want' to leave home. His mother ups the chores, forgets to make breakfast or do his laundry, while Paula does everything to make Tripp `bond' with her.Problem is, Tripp has a fear of commitment. Whenever he gets too close, he pulls away. His best pals constantly remind him of this, and bring up a past girlfriend who died tragically (this is perhaps the weakest part of the plot). If a girlfriend becomes too serious, Tripp does the one thing he knows will turn her off. He brings her home. What girl wants a guy who still lives with his parents?Predictably, Paula becomes much more involved with Tripp than is required professionally and love ensues. But when Tripp finds out about Paula's deception and that his parents hired her to get him to move out, he is furious.

170734,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,1415723702,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[3, 3]","Failure to Launch is a pretty entertaining film with an above average cast.  It's downright stupid in some ways, but it knows enough to just run with the story all the way through.  I was probably most interested in seeing how a constantly amusing Terry Bradshaw did in an actual comedy - not bad at all, really (even though I saw way, way more of him than I expected or ever wanted to see).  Of course, it helps that he's working alongside a world class actress like Kathy Bates, and the two of them do have some nice chemistry together in terms of the give and take.  Matthew McConaughey plays his leading role just right, if you ask me, reinforcing the somewhat farcical nature of the comedy.  As for Sarah Jessica Parker (who seems to be morphing into Madonna, which is sort of weird), there's that old Square Pegs bond still working in her favor.  Like many, though, I thought Zooey Deschanel really stood out from the rest of the cast - but maybe that's just because I find sarcastic morbidity strangely attractive.There must be something in the water wherever this story takes place, as you have a whole group of thirty-something men refusing to move out of their parents' houses (that's what ""failure to launch"" refers to, by the way).  These aren't nerds we're talking about, either.  Just look at Tripp (McConaughey), for example; he does all right for himself, never having to struggle to find female companionship, yet he feels compelled to nip every relationship in the bud at the first sign of ""the look"" in the girl's eyes.  All he has to do is bring the girl home, let her find out he still lives with his parents (Terry Bradshaw and Kathy Bates), and wave goodbye as she hustles out the door.  Now his folks love their son, but they also think it's way past the time for him to leave the nest - he's 35, for Pete's sake.  They can't just throw him out, of course - but there's another option.Enter Paula (Parker), a professional kicker out of nests.  Tripp's parents hire her to date their son, get him to fall in love with her, and thereby compel him to move out of their house already.  It's almost too easy, as Tripp follows Paula's lead every step along the way.  But, wouldn't you just know it, business and pleasure start to meld in Paula's heart and mind, setting up a chain of events Mr. Magoo could see coming five miles away.  Obvious as the ending is, it still works surprisingly well.  The transformation of Paula's roommate Kit (Deschanel) is just as interesting as the Tripp-Paula roller coaster ride of love, as she goes from a depressed semi-lunatic haunted by a mockingbird to a rather winsome lass who finds happiness without losing the dark edge that makes her so mysterious and interesting.The story isn't perfect, but its weaknesses don't seem to matter all that much as you watch it play out, largely because the film is consistently funny throughout.  Upon reflection, though, you realize that some plot details really weren't developed sufficiently - the whole nephew thing being a case in point.  I also can't approve of the way a couple of animals are treated in this film, yet even the most bothersome incident ended up being the funniest scene in the entire movie.  That's sort of Failure to Launch in a nutshell.  With its formulaic story, it really should be just another average film - but the fact of the matter is that it's well above average in terms of its entertainment value.",4,A thoroughly entertaining comedy,1163116800,"11 10, 2006",2006,3429,"['Failure', 'Launch', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'film', 'above', 'average', 'cast', 'downright', 'stupid', 'ways', 'enough', 'just', 'run', 'story', 'way', 'was', 'probably', 'most', 'interested', 'seeing', 'how', 'constantly', 'amusing', 'Terry', 'Bradshaw', 'did', 'actual', 'comedy', 'not', 'bad', 'really', 'even', 'saw', 'way', 'way', 'more', 'expected', 'ever', 'wanted', 'see', 'course', 'working', 'alongside', 'world', 'class', 'actress', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'two', 'do', 'have', 'nice', 'chemistry', 'together', 'terms', 'give', 'take', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'leading', 'role', 'just', 'right', 'ask', 'reinforcing', 'somewhat', 'farcical', 'nature', 'comedy', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'who', 'be', 'morphing', 'Madonna', 'sort', 'weird', 'old', 'Square', 'Pegs', 'bond', 'still', 'working', 'favor', 'many', 'thought', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'really', 'stood', 'out', 'rest', 'cast', 'maybe', 'just', 'find', 'sarcastic', 'morbidity', 'strangely', 'attractive.There', 'must', 'be', 'something', 'water', 'wherever', 'story', 'place', 'have', 'whole', 'group', 'thirty-something', 'men', 'refusing', 'move', 'parents', 'houses', 'what', 'failure', 'launch', 'refers', 'way', 'are', ""n't"", 'nerds', ""'re"", 'talking', 'Just', 'look', 'Tripp', 'McConaughey', 'example', 'all', 'right', 'never', 'having', 'struggle', 'find', 'female', 'companionship', 'yet', 'compelled', 'nip', 'relationship', 'bud', 'first', 'sign', 'look', 'girl', 'eyes', 'do', 'bring', 'girl', 'home', 'let', 'find', 'still', 'parents', 'Terry', 'Bradshaw', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'wave', 'goodbye', 'out', 'door', 'Now', 'folks', 'love', 'son', 'also', 'think', 'way', 'time', 'leave', 'nest', '35', 'Pete', 'sake', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'throw', 'out', 'course', 'option.Enter', 'Paula', 'Parker', 'professional', 'kicker', 'nests', 'Tripp', 'parents', 'hire', 'date', 'son', 'get', 'fall', 'love', 'thereby', 'compel', 'move', 'house', 'already', 'almost', 'too', 'easy', 'Tripp', 'Paula', 'lead', 'step', 'way', 'would', ""n't"", 'just', 'know', 'business', 'pleasure', 'start', 'meld', 'Paula', 'heart', 'mind', 'setting', 'up', 'chain', 'events', 'Mr.', 'Magoo', 'could', 'see', 'coming', 'five', 'miles', 'away', 'Obvious', 'ending', 'still', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'transformation', 'Paula', 'roommate', 'Kit', 'Deschanel', 'just', 'as', 'interesting', 'Tripp-Paula', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'love', 'depressed', 'semi-lunatic', 'haunted', 'mockingbird', 'rather', 'winsome', 'lass', 'who', 'happiness', 'losing', 'dark', 'edge', 'so', 'mysterious', 'interesting.The', 'story', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'weaknesses', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'matter', 'that', 'much', 'watch', 'play', 'out', 'largely', 'film', 'consistently', 'funny', 'reflection', 'though', 'realize', 'plot', 'details', 'really', 'were', ""n't"", 'developed', 'sufficiently', 'whole', 'nephew', 'thing', 'being', 'case', 'point', 'also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'approve', 'way', 'couple', 'animals', 'are', 'treated', 'film', 'yet', 'even', 'most', 'bothersome', 'incident', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'funniest', 'scene', 'entire', 'movie', 'sort', 'Failure', 'Launch', 'nutshell', 'formulaic', 'story', 'really', 'should', 'be', 'just', 'average', 'film', 'fact', 'matter', 'well', 'above', 'average', 'terms', 'entertainment', 'value']",N/A

Knowing the nature of the plot and seeing the low average rating here on amazon.com, I wasn't expecting to love this film, but I hoped that I'd like it a little more than I actually did.Matthew McConaughy plays Tripp, a 35 year old man who still lives with his parents, and is proud of it, as are his best friends. Tripp's parents, at a party full of other parents with kids still at home, hear about a woman who deals with this sort of thing (Sarah Jessica Parker). For a fee, she'll go out with the stay-at-home guy, pretend to fall in love with him, and convince him to move out of his parent's place and into hers. Tripp's parents agree to the deal, and the professional launcher gets to work. However, unlike her previous clients, Tripp's situation is a tangled one, one that ends up getting the usually professional woman all tangled up herself.A thirty something year old man still living with his parents isn't exactly a plot I found appealing (a bit depressing actually) but then again it could have been handled a lot worse, I thought. The plus about this plot is that I never knew (at least for the first hour or so) which way it was going to go, and how it was going to end. The supporting characters are more interesting than I would have guessed too. The trouble is, nothing that's really entertaining actually happens. There's a lot of slapstick stuff with animals (which I really didn't expect) but I didn't find it that funny. The film, towards the end, also feels like it is drawn out. It is only an hour and a half film, but it felt much longer to me. Also, towards the end, the film tries to get a little more dramatic and plays a few of the characters (Tripp, Tripp's parents) ""deeper"" than they are in the beginning, with issues and such. Doesn't really gel well, I don't think, and just makes things feel even more dragged out.There are many and varied special features on this DVD, including a making of documentary, original theatrical trailer, and an interview with Matthew McConaughy and Terry Bradshaw. It's a shame I didn't like the movie too much, otherwise I'm sure I would have found these more appealing.There are lots of romantic comedies to choose from, and I'd recommend you choose something other than ""Failure to Launch"".

The formula of placing eye candy stars in roles that require little more than one walk through rehearsal before filming seems to be a trend to satisfy the public, who unfortunately keep supporting these 20-minute sitcom ideas stretched beyond the limits of elasticity into a movie length features.The concept is that of a fixer called in to change a characters behavior only to have the 'fix' discovered and backfire. Tripp (Matthew McConaughey) is the middle-aged live-at-home-mooching-off-the-parents (a really sad comment on a male type too popular in the media) whose parents (Kathy Bates and Terry Bradshaw, trying desperately to find out why they signed up for this film) want him to move out and on.  They hire professional motivator Paula (Sarah Jessica Parker in a re-run of her Sex and the City mold) to affect this change only to have Tripp discover the plot and make some changes of his own  causing......fill in the blanks.While the stars of the film are good, solid actors who do their best with the flimsy script to make it interesting, the main reason to watch this film is for the eye candy which, in addition to Parker and McConaughey, includes the gifted Zooey Deschanel and Bradley Cooper.On a hot summer night without air-conditioning this bit of fluff requires no thought and does have some moments of tongue in cheek truths that make it enjoyable in the hands of this cast.

170749,A2HVL790PBWYTU,1415723702,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","It's not an awful movie. Certainly, FAILURE TO LAUNCH has its share of moments. The watchability factor is brought along nicely by the agreeable performances of Matthew McConaughey, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Zooey Deschanel. Even ex-football jock and good ol' boy Terry Bradshaw doesn't embarass himself acting-wise (his nude scenes, on the other hand - aaargh!). The plot itself is pretty ludicrous: that of a female professional interventionist being hired by the parents of a live-in 35-year-old man to have a relationship with their son, give him self-esteem, and thus motivate him to move out. Apparently, the son is suffering thru what is called the ""failure to launch"" syndrome.This movie even does something which romantic movies hardly ever do, which is delve deeper than usual into the male lead's relationship with his buddies. It seemed like half the film was spent with scenes of Tripp (Matthew McConaughey) hanging out with his two best dudes in some form of rigorous sport activity. Of course, these buddy-bonding moments didn't get too serious or emotional, but there was some sincere acting stuff there. To me, however, the real standout is Zooey Deschanel, who plays Sarah Jessica Parker's dour but hot roommate Kit. She owned every scene that she was in. Girl's got charisma.But there's something missing here. For example, the sequences with the various attacking animals were droll enough (and the funniest scene in the movie involved the resuscitating of a mockingbird), but they went overboard with them. That nano-second shot of a chortling post-bite lizard compromised the film's tone for me, as that scene devolved the movie from initially a romantic, lighthearted romp into just outright farcical silliness. Also, the ridiculous climax was poorly thought out and then done by the numbers. Surely, the writer could've thought of a better 15-minute ending to resolve things.As for the two leads, I haven't seen the vibrant S. J. Parker in years and she looks marvelous here and puts in a nice effort as Paula, the professional parents-son separator. It's also nice to see McConaughey in a light-hearted gig and he carries off the role of the stay-at-home son with easy southern charm and panache. The two leads certainly provide some good chemistry. But, maybe, just maybe, the producers should've gotten someone not as good looking, someone not ""Sexiest Man Alive 2005"" material. Given the true circumstances of why Tripp chooses to stay at his parents' home (divulged around three-quarters of the way thru), it was still pretty implausible for me to buy into - as well, as hard to relate with - this breezy, handsome fella with a great job seemingly needing professional intervention - especially when contrasted with another one of Paula's ""work,"" the chubby and more believable Pat Oswald.I guess I'm giving this one a marginal blessing. Two and a half stars, because the cast was winsome and earnest enough. Again, I couldn't get enough of Zooey Deschanel. It's not their fault that they got torpedoed by an underwhelming story, which fizzles out at the end.

Thottam ""mortgage maven""","[2, 6]","Jameson Thottam states that Failure to Launch really takes offJust when you thought Sarah Jessica Parker had sold all her Sex and the City dresses and movie costumes to PremiereProps.com here's come another chance for her, this time though, she wears a new hat, and offers us a fresh new look at her talents.The Story ^ Jameson Thottam ^As to the story, well, the real true-to-life dramas of ""coming home"" films are hard to find in the Hollywood mainsteam (aka Paramount, Miramax, Lion's Gate type films). While other studios prefer to focus on more serious matters, like teenage love, cop buddy chase films, and the all important fantasy space battle between good and evil -- perfect for movie props and memorabilia for them to sell on StarWars.com and premiereprops.com or ToyRus.com -- but what about movies for people with IQs over 50...Well, though I don't know my IQ, its refreshing to see a film like Failure to Launch this get some screen time.The film ^ Jameson Thottam ^In this film, Mathew McConaughey reprises his role from that other film with Kate Hudson. He plays this part like the back of his hand. Is he this way in real life? He's beginning to get stereotyped...His parents, played by the Bradshaw and Kathy Bates are excellent. The plot gets heavy and twisted, which is good for romatic comedy.Some character discussion ^ Jameson Thottam ^Deniro, Pacino, Brando and now Bradhaw. That's NFL hall of Famer, Fox TV broadcaster Terry Bradshaw my friends. Mr. Bradshaw proves to be the thespian of life in Paramount Pictures `Failure to Launch', a film starring Matthew McConaughey that centers around a 35 year old man who still lives with his parents, and has no intentions of leaving.Getting Real ^ Jameson Thottam ^In the pantheon of the genre of romantic comedies, they are what they are. Do we have a handsome, easygoing, breezy male lead? McConaughey, John Cusack, Orlando Bloom... any one will do. Check! Do we have an attractive, slightly neurotic, tightly wound female lead? Sarah Jessica Parker, Kate Hudson, Julia Roberts? Check! Does she have borderline slutty girl friends? Check! Does HE have well meaning, screwed up friends who muck everything up only to set it right in the end? Check! We now have everything we need to greenlight a rom-com. We'll worry about a script later.Shake out ^ Jameson Thottam ^So, these things being what they are, how does this one shake out? Mr. Mconaughey was literally born for these rolls, since he does do quite a few of them. He seems perpetually tanned, obviously works out a lot, comes equipped with a disarming country smile, has the whitest teeth this side of Lauren Hill and looks like a fun dude to hang out with. As slacker Tripp (with no last name that I know of) he handles the role so effortlessly it's almost as if he didn't even have to act it out. Sarah Jessica Parker plays a woman hired by Tripp's parents to be his girlfriend, and thus give him incentive to fly the coop. She too is perpetually tanned, works a lot and his very white teeth. However, I'm not quite sold on her ability as a leading lady, and her performance in this movie didn't help. Not that the character needs much depth, since it is a romantic comedy and all, but it didn't seem as if what little there may have been was effectively brought across by the actress. More at fault may be the fact the character was grossly underwritten and the fact that they saved all the good stuff for Zooey Deschanel (sister of actress Emily Deschanel. Neither of theses young ladies is anywhere close to being perpetually tanned) who plays her dry witted, pathologically violent, borderline slutty roommate. What happens next? I don't want to give anything away, but she falls in client, he finds out his parents hired her, he gets upset, she gets sad, they split apart, they get back together. Oh yeah, spoilers. My bad. In between rom-com clich&eacute;'s are some very funny over top moments, mostly involving crazed wildlife and, of course, Terry Bradshaw. Terry along with Kathy Bates plays Tripp's parents, and you would think having to act across academy winner, and genuine great actress Ms. Bates might be intimidating for the former football player. Man, dude has won four Super-Bowls! You can't intimidate T.B.! All kidding aside, Terry Bradshaw is very funny as the beleaguered dad and considering his last movie role was in 1981's Cannonball run. I can understand why it took him 25 years to act in another film.So if your wife insists on dragging you to a romantic comedy, this one ain't so bad. And it has Terry Bradshaw in it.

That doesn't mean that I wish an entire film had been made only of the costars, but only that I was less than enthused with the main story line.That's not a good thing.The premise is a flimsy one. Tripp is thirty-five, and still lives with his parents, Sue and Al, played well by Kathy Bates and a game Terry Bradshaw. Sue and Al fraternize with three other couples whose sons, preposterously, also live at home. That is, until one of those couples found Paula, a so-called professional interventionist, and paid her to charm their son and through a series of steps (none of which made much sense to me) Paula was able to get him to move out. Sue and Al fall for this crackpot gimmick, and hire Paula.Paula, we can tell, is doing well for herself. She lives in what looks like a large house with one roommate, and they both like to drink champagne - not just any, they drink non-vintage Bollinger. It's not the cheapest, and not the most expensive, but definitely well above the average person's ""every-day champagne"". (It retails for between $34.99 a bottle and $45.99.) The roommate (Kit, played beautifully by Zooey Deschanel) is obsessed with a mockingbird that won't stop singing outside of her window. This provides an interesting side-story, and definitely the biggest laughs.Tripp's two best friends also live with their parents, so Paula, it should seem, would be hard pressed for her plans to work with Tripp, but she doesn't seem to think so (nor do the filmmakers), so she moves forward with her multi-stepped plan. One part of her plan is to share an emotional moment, and on what seems like the third day of knowing him, she calls him, crying hysterically. She's at the vet, and claims that the dog on the table in front of them is her dog, and it's being put to sleep. Her performance is, I suppose, believable. Tripp thinks so. But here's my problem: what girl/guy would want to drag a guy/girl that they very much want to bond with into such a dramatic experience right away? Nobody wants to appear overemotional or needy, and that's exactly what Paula is risking. And that's a huge risk! But, it works. It shouldn't have, though. The Tripp we've been introduced to would have seen that as too much.It's all too much, really, and if not for her friend with the mockingbird, this movie wouldn't fare so well.

Menta, Jr.","[3, 3]","I don't watch a lot of this type of movie, but I found ""Failure To Launch"" to be good fun, and even a little clever: I liked the way various animals kept biting and attacking Matthew McConaughey's character, because they instinctively sensed his antithetical-to-nature lifestyle (sponging off his parents, continually keeping true responsibility at bay, etc.).  It also spends a little time fleshing out the supporting characters and giving them funny things to do... though I could have done without Terry Bradshaw's extended nude scene (I'm not kidding).  I mean, the guy's still in good shape and actually turns out to be a pretty good comedic actor (plus, yeah, it's more of a comic nude scene and not a sex scene), but c'mon.A sharp picture, a handful of adequately illuminating extras, and a main feature running time that doesn't overstay its welcome (the movie is a shade over 90 minutes) make this an easy DVD to recommend, at least for a single viewing.  Romantic comedy fans, and fans of Mr. McConaughey and Sarah Jessica Parker, likely wouldn't regret taking the further step and owning it.And, oh yeah, I have to give credit where credit is due:  there's a wicked funny scene that sends up Star Wars/science fiction movie geeks that's absolutely priceless.

170764,A34D06JL7LC6MU,1415723702,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[4, 6]","""Failure to Launch,"" despite recieving negative reviews and mixed audience reception, is actually one of the best romantic comedies of the year. Not just because of the witty script, but also because of the charm of Matthew McConaughey, Sarah Jessica Parker, Zooey Deschanel, Justin Bartha, Terry Bradshaw, and Kathy Bates. The movie does have the typical romantic comedy formula, but that's OK. McConaughey ('Sahara') plays Tripp, a 35 year old man who still lives with is parents (Bates and Bradshaw). As his parents, Al and Sue, look around they notice that it's time for Tripp to move out of the house. Problem is, they don't want to tell him. So they hire a woman named Paula (Parker, 'Sex and the City') who deals with convincing men to move out of their parent's house. Problem is, she's never had a case like this. While most of these men are overweight with no social skills; Tripp is charming, funny, and attractive. In the romantic comedy sub-plot, Tripp's friend Ace (Bartha, 'National Treasure') falls in love with Paula's roommateKit (Deschanel, 'All the Real Girls'), who harbors a hatred for an annoying mockingbird that lives outside her window. One critic (Richard Roeper) complained that the movie was unrealistic, because of the presence of McConaughey. He said McConaughey was the kind of guy who moves out of his parent's house at 15 because he's dating his teacher...Technically, he's right. But that's the point of this movie. They didn't want to cast a person like Philip Seymour Hoffman in the role. They need a good looking, charismatic lead. Roger Ebert complained that you didn't really like the characters because they're all deceitful. The writers of this movie admit that the characters aren't particularly likeable, but I didn't mind them. All the actors are perfectly cast, but in my opinion it's the Deschanel-Bartha part of the movie that really makes it interesting. First of all, Zooey Deschanel is not only a very talented actress (see ""All the Real Girls"" or ""Winter Passing"") but she's also capable of being funny. In this movie, she's in top comic form. Her character, Kit, is very funny. She's quite literally the highlight of this movie. Anyway, if you don't like silly romantic comedies like ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"" or ""Just Friends"" you probably won't like this.

The male lead still lives at home, and all of his friends are also grown men who won't leave the nest.  His parents say they hate him living there but continue to spoil and indulge him -- and all of their friends are parents of kids who won't leave the nest.  Are you sensing a pattern here?Instead of evicting their home-bound son, the parents overcompensate by hiring a woman to do their job for them.  This part is played by Sarah Jessica Parker, starring as Carrie Bradshaw/Paula -- in one scene, Matthew McConaughey even compliments her shoes.  The token black character also doubles as the obligatory precocious child.  The male characters talk like only male characters in movies talk.  Then there's a strange subplot involving McConaughey's character getting bit by a bunch of random animals, and a totally ridiculous subplot involving a mockingbird.But what does any of that matter, really.  When you watch a movie like this you pretty much know what you're getting into, and when it stars Matthew McConaughey, who pretty much makes his entire living these days starring in fluff-n-fold movies where he spends most of his time shirtless, you definitely can't expect anything more.  His days of making actual quality films are obviously way behind him.  The extras on the disc are mostly forgettable, but there is a rather interesting feature on ""The Failure to Launch Contest"" that amused me.  You always hear about random contests a movie runs as a cheap way to gin up free publicity, but it's rare for any of them to have a human face, or visible results.  This contest involved two actors from the film actually picking a person to award with six months of free rent, which is a VERY good prize, and they seemed to pick a deserving winner.If only the same could be said of the movie.  It's not a winner, nor is it deserving of any accolades, but it's watchable and it kills the time.",2,Failure to think outside the rom-com box.,1239667200,"04 14, 2009",2009,2016,"['flick', 'footsteps', 'so', 'many', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'complex', 'premises', 'way', 'mirror', 'real', 'life', 'male', 'lead', 'still', 'home', 'friends', 'are', 'also', 'grown', 'men', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'nest', 'parents', 'say', 'hate', 'living', 'there', 'continue', 'spoil', 'indulge', 'friends', 'are', 'parents', 'kids', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'nest', 'Are', 'sensing', 'pattern', 'here', 'Instead', 'evicting', 'home-bound', 'son', 'parents', 'overcompensate', 'hiring', 'woman', 'do', 'job', 'part', 'played', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'starring', 'Carrie', 'Bradshaw/Paula', 'one', 'scene', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'even', 'shoes', 'token', 'black', 'character', 'also', 'obligatory', 'precocious', 'child', 'male', 'characters', 'talk', 'only', 'male', 'characters', 'movies', 'talk', 'Then', 'strange', 'subplot', 'involving', 'McConaughey', 'character', 'getting', 'bit', 'bunch', 'random', 'animals', 'totally', 'ridiculous', 'subplot', 'involving', 'mockingbird.But', 'what', 'matter', 'really', 'When', 'watch', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'getting', 'when', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'who', 'pretty', 'much', 'entire', 'living', 'days', 'starring', 'fluff-n-fold', 'movies', 'where', 'most', 'time', 'shirtless', 'definitely', 'ca', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', 'more', 'days', 'making', 'actual', 'quality', 'films', 'are', 'obviously', 'way', 'extras', 'disc', 'are', 'mostly', 'forgettable', 'rather', 'interesting', 'feature', 'Failure', 'Launch', 'Contest', 'amused', 'always', 'hear', 'random', 'contests', 'movie', 'cheap', 'way', 'gin', 'up', 'free', 'publicity', 'rare', 'have', 'human', 'face', 'visible', 'results', 'contest', 'involved', 'two', 'actors', 'film', 'actually', 'picking', 'person', 'award', 'six', 'months', 'free', 'rent', 'VERY', 'good', 'prize', 'seemed', 'pick', 'deserving', 'winner.If', 'only', 'same', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'movie', 'not', 'winner', 'deserving', 'accolades', 'watchable', 'time']",N/A

His parents (gamely played by Kathy Bates and Terry Bradshaw), want him out of the house, so they hire Paula (Sarah Jessica Parker), to trick him into falling for her and convince him to move out of the house.  Of course, nothing goes as planned and Paula actually starts to fall for Tripp.  Meanwhile, there's a running subplot with every geek's fantasy, Kit (the lovely Zooey Deschanel), attempting to rid her home of a pesky mockingbird and trying to stop the advances of one of Tripp's buddies.The story moves along at a pace much better than the average romantic comedy, and although McConaughey is perfectly cast as Tripp, I feel that Sarah Jessica Parker just didn't fit well in this film.  Perhaps it's the fact that I see her as the annoying Carrie from ""Sex and the City.""  There are a few moments involving wildlife that try to be humorous, but are often played up a little bit too much as if the director is trying to convince the viewer that they should laugh at what's happening.  Also, there's one scene involving a bit of bare backside that just seems to be thrown in in hopes for a cheap laugh.  It doesn't fit with the rest of the film and throw off the entire plot for a few minutes.Other than these few moments, this is actually a pretty funny flick.  The strongest characters here aren't the leads, but co-stars Deschanel, Justin Bartha, and Bradley Cooper.  Much like every other reviewer has stated, these actors make the entire film watchable.  From Deschanel's bizarre yet sexy moodswings to the gung-ho mentality of eternal slacker, Demo, to the innocence of programmer, Ace, it all works perfectly for some humorous sequences.  Heck, just the names, Kit, Ace, and Demo, are funny.  Bates and Bradshaw seemed to be having fun during the making of this flick, that comes through on the screen.Don't get me wrong, McConaughey does a great job with what he's got to work with.

His mom cleans his room from top to bottom while he's in the shower every morning and always makes him a gourmet breakfast, something she doesn't even do for her husband.His parents aren't as happy with the arrangement.

So the job of a movie such as this is to keep the audience entertained so we forget we already know where we're going.  Here, the movie really shines.  Part of the fun is watching Paula at work.  We know what she's up to, so several of the scenes become a joke as we watch Trip fall for each ""step"" hook, line, and sinker.  To top this, there are several genuinely funny scenes, such as the scene that takes all the characters to play paintball.  Even when the movie gets more serious in the final third, the overall tone is lighthearted.Helping things along is the great cast.  Everyone is having fun, and it keeps the tone light and the audience engaged.  Special note goes to Zooey Deschanel.

170784,A3R4ZEDVRUWJNO,1415723702,Mark,"[4, 10]","Failure to Launch has a good premise, but doesn't come through on it's promise.  The story goes from a decent setup to a convoluted and idiotic film, filled with holes.  Tripp (Matthew McConaughey) is in his thirties and still lives with his parents.  He has two friends Ace (Justin Bartha) and Demo (Bradley Cooper, fresh from The Wedding Crashers) who also still live with their parents.  They get into a debate about the positives of living with their parents, and Tripp comes to the conclusion that ""it's going to take a stick of dynamite"" to get him out of his parents house.  Enter stick of dynamite, Paula (Sarah Jessica Parker).  She proposes to Tripp's parents (played by Terry Bradshaw and Kathy Bates) a plan that will get Tripp out of their house once and for all.  She states that male confidence is at it's highest during a relationship, and she simulates one to boost male confidence and get them to move out.  Here is where the biggest plothole occurs.  My question is: Since she does not have sex with them, nor continue the relationship after the guy moves out, then how does her method work?  If male confidence is high during a relationship, what happens when Paula severs their relationship?  Wouldn't their confidence be lowered?  Wouldn't they move back in with their parents?  Alas, these questions are never answered, and dull and unfunny humor fills the rest of the script.  Why a high ranking film critic like Stephen Holden of the New York Times called this film ""witty"" is beyond me.  I don't remember ever laughing.  Tripp and Paula begin their relationship, and she takes him through many steps of a standard relationship (meeting his friends, letting him show her how to do something, etc.).  One thing that truly bothered me, and also lowered the rating from two stars to one, is the fact that Tripp gets bitten by every animal in the animal kingdom.  From chipmunks to dolphins to lizards, Tripp gets it all.  By the last time that he was bitten, I was standing and yelling at the television, asking, ""It wasn't funny the first time he was bitten, so why would you do it sixty-five times?""  Like last week's ""The Hills Have Eyes"", the characters are less than intelligent.  The only light to the film is the plot between Kit (Zooey Deschanel), Paula's unlikely roomate, and a mockingbird outside her window.  Her whining about the bird was funny, but as usual, the film takes it too far when she get's involved in a relationship with Tripp's friend Ace, and they decide to shoot it with a BB gun.

Yes, I realize that the formula is hardly rocket science and that many of the scenes are just plain silly.  But the bottom line is that viewers will have a nice time as long as they don't try be a serious film critic.The key to the film are the actors.  For a film at this level, I can't imagine a much better cast.  Matthew McConaughey really fits this type of role as the carefree, still-living-at-home, charismatic playboy.  Zooey Deschanel is great is the wierd roommate who ends up sharing the spotlight.  Bradley Cooper and Justin Bartha add a lot has McConaugheys buddies.  Terry Bradshaw and Kathy Bates weren't even too bad.  Sarah Jessica Parker was nice, but she's really starting to look artifically preserved as she battles with her 40s.  She was the only one who was a little miscast, although the part would have been perfect for her 10 years ago.The premise is that Ms. Parker serves as a woman who gets guys to move out of their parents house by becomeing somewhat of a girlfriend (the guys parents pay her to do this).  While some don't like the premise (""what happens when they find out!"") because its unrealistic, I would say that these people are taking this film WAY too seriously.  This is light hearted fare.  If you want a movie for serious discussion, rent ""Million Dollar Baby"" or something like that.Please save yourself nightmares for the next couple of years and fast forward through the scenes of Terry Bradshaw walking around naked.  The discussion during those scenes is meaningless; I think the writers just made something up to fill the 3 minutes Terry's naked.  It just doen't work as a gag.Otherwise, the film is full of silly moments and funny scenes.  This is an enjoyable film if you don't try to take it too seriously.",4,Nice date movie.

170801,A32J48LYJ2BNNY,1415723702,Monty Rainey,"[6, 7]","It's been a while since I've laughed this hard at a movie. Yes, it's a date movie, and even a borderline ""chick-flick"", not the type of movie I would normally pay to go see, but with Matthew McConaughey and Kathy Bates, I figured it might be worth it. Then throw in Terry Bradshaw, who is liked by virtually every football fan and whose willingness to poke fun at himself might bring some unexpected humor, I had to check it out. Boy, am I glad I did. As date movies and chick-flicks go, there wasn't much originality, but come on, how much originality does one really expect when watching a date movie/chick-flick?The plot focuses on an ever-growing problem of a young man (35, hey, that's young to me) who fails to accept responsibility for himself. Rather than becoming a responsible adult, he chooses to continue to have his mother dutifully tend his every need; laundry, cleaning, meals, etc. The weary parents want him out of the house so they can enjoy their golden years in peace in quiet, so they hear about a young woman who, through her dating system, has been successful in encouraging young men such as this, to finally take the step into adulthood. The young woman is hired, the contract is signed and the artificial romance begins.The movie is just plain funny. McConaughey is his usual charming and witty self, Bates, as expected, plays her part as doting mother magnificently, Bradshaw, who I expected to really just have a few cameo appearances, takes an active roll in the movie and plays his part well with, as I anticipated, some very unexpected humor. I'm no fan of Sarah Jessica Parker, but she played her part well. The big surprise for me was an actress I didn't know named Zooey Deschanel, who looks like a young Debra Winger and whose dry humor brought the biggest laughs.I won't spoil anything with more details of the movie, but all-in-all, this was a pleasant surprise and very funny movie.

First, the problem, (guy won't leave home at 35 years old), followed by the attempted solution, which happens to be the professional ""intervener"", Paula. Thirdly, feelings develop, but the fourth element of the formula gets in the way, (in this case, the whole deal between Paula and Trip's parents gets blown wide open). This is all concluded in typical Hollywood romance style with what has to be the sappiest Hollywood romance ending I have seen.However, in all this predictable formula, there were some genuine funny parts, such as Trip being victimised by nature, (bitten by vegetarian lizards, attacked by a dolphin and brutally assaulted by a chipmunk, among others). There were also some good witticisms from secondary characters, such as Trips two friends and Paula's flatmate, the mockingbird-hating Kat.All in all, it was an ok movie for the romantic comedy buffs, with some light entertainment thrown in to keep the rest of us happy.

As far as romance comedies go, I'd rate this one right up there with ""Breakfast at Tiffany's,"" and ""When Harry Met Sally.""Matthew McConaughey plays Tripp, the semi-aging bachelor who has it all, plenty of women to date, a free place to live, and when relationships get too serious a place to bring them back to in order to ensure they are chased away...that's right to his Mom and Dad's house (where he still lives).  It turns out there is a syndrome for this inabilty to move out of one's parents house, which McConaughey's friends all share in this movie--failure to launch.  Enter Sara Jessica Parker.  She serves as a consultant of sorts to take guy clients through a step by step process to get them on their own again.  Great turns are turned in by Tripp's parents played by Kathy Bates and Terry Bradshaw, he of the nekkid room.We get zaniness and tomfoolery aplenty with some laugh out loud moments involving wildlife and animals of all peaceful shapes and sizes' personal vendetta against McConaughey.  I got to watch this movie with several of the ladies of Boise's Head Start program as a team building exercise following a Federal Review and I must say I am truly thankful to those ladies.

Sadly, it aluminates another growing trait in our modern world...kids age thirty and up still living with their parents, though most of the real-life situations are for other reasons than our main character's motives.  Matthew McConaughey was amusing as the thirty-five-year-old who used living with his parents to avoid committing to a relationship.  As the therapist (I think that's her position) called in to fix this issue, Sarah Jessica Parker wasn't entirely bland, but she could have been a lot livelier.  The comedy gold of the film came from the main characters parents, Terry Bradshaw and Kathy Bates.  Bradshaw nicely portrayed a number of quirky habits throughout the film that can only leave you wondering what he's going to do next.  I could never get enough of Kathy Bates and this film is no exception...put her in more scenes and just make up reasons for her being there.  Bradley Cooper and Justin Bartha did all right as the leading man's two best friends, but they lacked any sort of individual personalities...the movie could have accomplished the same thing with just one friend.  Someone who did have personality was Zooey Deschanel, playing the free-spirited (that'd be an understatement) roommate of Sarah Jessica Parker's character.

I agree with the other reviewers she is the funniest thing in the movie.  But her character also made me see ""bipolar"" differently.  Sure, some of them are impossible and this was only a movie, but they have a bad rap in a society that over emphasizes politically correct under-reaction.  Zooey is Jungian complete.  She is not dominated by one way or another of reacting to something.  She will see and express both pleasure and annoyance at the advances of her suitor.  And by the end of the movie, they seem to be having the most fun compared to the lead couple who turn out to be boringly traditional after all.But I disagree that the main point of the relationship between Paula and Tripp is that it's based initially on deception and falls into that category.  This would have been cleared up rather easily.  The subtext here is that Paula's entry into the relationship is based on her own past unreliable experiences with men and she tries to substitute a financial relationship for a personal one, like an exotic dancer or an escort.  She's a glorified escort by another name.  She goes to bed with her clients and does this for money, for crying out loud, how can you gloss over that?  :DThis is an exaggerated case, of course.  Most women in that situation just get bitter and become casual users of men, not actual escorts.  I think the movie manages to explore this issue, its causes, and its cures (which seem to involve seeing the whole context of friends and family), while staying light and funny.

Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[1, 2]","I found this film in the $5 bin at Walmart and thought, ""Matthew McConaughey and Sarah Jessica Parker in a movie together? How in the world could this possibly even get down to $5?"" Then I watched it. ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"" is one of my favorite movies, and I adored the chemistry between McConaughey and Kate Hudson. It was like those two were meant to be together in real life, much like my other favorite movie characters (ex. Nia Long and Larenz Tate, Gabrielle Union and Idris Elba, Bill Cosby and Phylicia Rashad). However, I did not see that same chemistry between Parker and McConaughey. I thought they gave it a great shot, but I didn't believe those two would ever date. Something about the two of them just seemed off to me.On top of that, through the whole movie, I just couldn't picture McConaughey living at home. He seemed more suited to play Bradley Cooper's role as the wanderer. Justin Bartha should've played the lead. He could've pulled this role off. Zooey Deschanel's role was annoying and didn't really add to the script. I lost interest in her being the cranky roommate who wanted to kill a mockingbird almost instantly and didn't even think Bartha's character would give her the time of day. I liked the relationship between McConaughey's character Tripp and Tyrel Jackson Williams' character Jeffrey though. I wish somebody would've showed a picture or a scene from his last girlfriend because since we really had so little backstory, their relationship seemed like a last minute decision.The only two people I really enjoyed in this film were Tripp's parents, Terry Bradshaw as Al and Kathy Bates as Sue. I thought their problem with not wanting to let their kid go and not knowing how to get to know each other again as a couple--not just as parents--was a valid and interesting story. I think the bigger problem is that this film was hard for me to enjoy anyway because I think it's so pitiful to be a grown-up living in your parents' home. Turn 18, get out!This wasn't the movie for me, but watching Bradshaw stroll around the fishtank naked is the only reason I'm giving it more than one star.

170841,A268EEWUXYCA8Q,1415723702,Terry Mesnard,"[5, 6]","There are two major problems plaguing this movie.  The first is the same one that hurt Must Love Dogs: the two screenwriters were former TV/Sitcom writers.  There is a huge difference in the humor of sitcoms/TV and movies.  Sitcom humor is good in small dosages, the 30 minutes it usually takes to tell the story and the more popular ones are about witty repartee and conversations about things that are there only to invoke a laugh.  Sitting around, swapping witty lines for the sake of being witty is funny in sitcoms.  In movies, its stupid.  And its a waste of time.  Filler.  So, while there are some very funny scenes, the humor doesn't last the entire picture or help elevate it.The other problem and by the far the largest is the character of Kit and the casting of Zooey Deschanel to play her.  Zooey is an actor who has been resigned to bit parts or sidekicks.  However, in every movie I've seen her in she has stolen each and every scene she's in.  This movie is no exception.But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Failure to Launch has an interesting premise: a rather successful, handsome and extreme sportsman guy still lives with his parents.  His parents want him out of the house and to live his own life so they can, apparently, have a naked room among other things.  Enter Sarah Jessica Parker's Paula who has a job (er, what?) that creates a romantic situation for said guy to give him the courage and esteem to leave the family.  Of course, if you watch romantic comedies you know this will involve them falling in love, him finding out, them falling apart yadda yadda yadda.In that respect, this movie follows the romantic movie cliches to the ""T.""  The problem I've already mentioned, Zooey Deschanel, is that her character is much much much more interesting than Sarah and Matthew's.  Kit's story was just so funny, imaginative and interesting that whenever she wasn't on screen, I didn't really care for the movie.  She injects a sitcom character with so much life and energy that I actually developed a pathos for her.  Unfortunately, she's relegated to the sidekick role and doesn't have as much screen time.Failure to Launch isn't as bad as all the critics are saying.  Various ""witty"" catch-phrases were invented due to the dubious name of the film.  Unfortunately, Failure to Launch isn't terrific.  It relies too much on sitcom style humor and scenes meant for nothing but to elicit that style of laugh and not enough on the actual story and character.  And Zooey's Kit is just too good of a character to be relegated to the sidelines.  For once, I'd like to see a film about that nutty bestfriend/sidekick who has given up on finding someone who gets him or her and is so annoyed with the chirping bird outside the window to try and purchase a gun.",3,Funny but utterly flawed,1142899200,"03 21, 2006",2006,2775,"['are', 'two', 'major', 'problems', 'plaguing', 'movie', 'first', 'same', 'one', 'Must', 'Love', 'Dogs', 'two', 'screenwriters', 'were', 'former', 'TV/Sitcom', 'writers', 'huge', 'difference', 'humor', 'sitcoms/TV', 'movies', 'Sitcom', 'humor', 'good', 'small', 'dosages', '30', 'minutes', 'usually', 'tell', 'story', 'more', 'popular', 'ones', 'are', 'witty', 'repartee', 'conversations', 'things', 'are', 'there', 'only', 'invoke', 'laugh', 'Sitting', 'around', 'swapping', 'witty', 'lines', 'sake', 'being', 'witty', 'funny', 'sitcoms', 'movies', 'stupid', 'waste', 'time', 'Filler', 'So', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'scenes', 'humor', ""n't"", 'last', 'entire', 'picture', 'help', 'elevate', 'it.The', 'other', 'problem', 'far', 'largest', 'character', 'Kit', 'casting', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'play', 'Zooey', 'actor', 'who', 'been', 'resigned', 'bit', 'parts', 'sidekicks', 'However', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'stolen', 'scene', 'movie', 'exception.But', ""'m"", 'getting', 'ahead', 'Failure', 'Launch', 'interesting', 'premise', 'rather', 'successful', 'handsome', 'extreme', 'sportsman', 'guy', 'still', 'parents', 'parents', 'want', 'house', 'live', 'own', 'life', 'can', 'apparently', 'have', 'naked', 'room', 'other', 'things', 'Enter', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'Paula', 'who', 'job', 'er', 'what', 'romantic', 'situation', 'said', 'guy', 'give', 'courage', 'esteem', 'leave', 'family', 'course', 'watch', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'know', 'will', 'involve', 'falling', 'love', 'finding', 'out', 'falling', 'apart', 'yadda', 'yadda', 'yadda.In', 'respect', 'movie', 'romantic', 'movie', 'cliches', 'T.', 'problem', ""'ve"", 'already', 'mentioned', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'character', 'much', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'Sarah', 'Matthew', 'Kit', 'story', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'funny', 'imaginative', 'interesting', 'whenever', 'was', ""n't"", 'screen', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'movie', 'sitcom', 'character', 'so', 'much', 'life', 'energy', 'actually', 'developed', 'pathos', 'Unfortunately', 'relegated', 'sidekick', 'role', ""n't"", 'have', 'as', 'much', 'screen', 'time.Failure', 'Launch', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'critics', 'are', 'saying', 'Various', 'witty', 'catch-phrases', 'were', 'invented', 'due', 'dubious', 'name', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'Failure', 'Launch', ""n't"", 'terrific', 'too', 'much', 'sitcom', 'style', 'humor', 'scenes', 'meant', 'nothing', 'elicit', 'style', 'laugh', 'not', 'enough', 'actual', 'story', 'character', 'Zooey', 'Kit', 'just', 'too', 'good', 'character', 'be', 'relegated', 'sidelines', 'once', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'film', 'nutty', 'bestfriend/sidekick', 'who', 'given', 'up', 'finding', 'someone', 'who', 'so', 'annoyed', 'chirping', 'bird', 'window', 'try', 'purchase', 'gun']",N/A

The scene with the Star Wars nerd and Parker on a paid date is entertaining: she plays Darth Vader's march on a kazoo, and he gets all overexcited.  Then she ditches him.  Zooey Deschanel plays Parkers' kooky roommate (sister?) Kit, and has the right stuff with Tripp's friend Ace (Justin Bartha) in a funny scene where they almost kill a mockingbird.

If the film is a Failure, you are only making it easier for movie reviewers to expose what a Dog your Bad film is.Failure To...Come Up With An Interesting Story...Trip (Matthew McConaughey, the remarkably similar ""How To Lose A Guy In 10 days""), a 30 something boat salesman, still lives with his parents. No wonder. His Mom (Kathy Bates) waits on him hand and foot; while he is in the shower, she makes his bed, lays out his laundry and vacuums the floor in his room. When he comes downstairs, she serves him pancakes, scrambled eggs, bacon and sausage while his Dad (Terry Bradshaw) eats oatmeal. At a barbecue, Mom and Dad learn a couple of their friends recently got their son to move out of the house...Wait a minute! You mean moving out of your parents house is a choice?...using the services of a professional motivator, Paula (Sarah Jessica Parker). Paula takes the assignment. Along the way, Paula meets Trip's friends, Ace (Justin Bartha) and Demo (Bradley Cooper), both of whom still live with their parents, and Trip meets Paula's roommate Kit (Zooey Deschanel).It isn't necessary to describe any more of the story to you; you have already figured it out.The four year old sitting behind me was able to (loudly) predict what was going to happen next on more than one occasion.Failure To...Create Romance...With two such extremely attractive leads, it would be impossible to not create some sexual energy. Right? Matthew McConaughey and Sarah Jessica Parker. Hmmmm. I'm getting excited just thinking about them together. But director Tom Dey (the cute, fun ""Shanghai Noon"", the abysmal ""Showtime"" starring Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro) and writers Tom Astler and Matt Ember don't make the characters interesting. They get together, hug, kiss, maybe things lead further, but they talk about little and as a result, we don't learn enough about them. At one point, we learn about one single aspect of their previous relationships. These moments are meant to make their current actions acceptable, but it doesn't work. Neither character is very interesting, very nice or very attractive as a result.Failure To...Create Interesting Leads...Let's look at each character in a little more depth. Trip, a man at least 35, had a relationship six years ago. He was going to marry the girl, but she died and this scarred him, so he still lives at home. Because of that traumatic event, he seems to consider this license; to live with his parents, drive a Porsche, hang out with his buddies participating in extreme sports and bring a different girl home every night. But wait, if the relationship was six years ago, that means he still lived at home when he was 25, 26, 27, 28 and 29. What was his excuse then?...Really, it's a choice?...Paula also had a bad experience some years ago, but the details are vague. Now, she is a Professional Motivator, which is apparently a new way of labeling the world's oldest profession. Basically, because of this bad relationship, she takes money for dating men. Her pretense is this helps them get out of the nest. She tries to convince herself this is a good thing for these men. See, she even has a heart of gold as well. As soon as they are out of the nest, she dumps them. It seems like this would create a bigger problem, but I digress.Failure To...Balance The Characters...""Launch"" is another of those big budget `romantic comedies' in which the supporting cast is more interesting than the leads. Ace, played by Justin Bartha, is quirky and unusual, offering some surprises along the way. Kit, played by Zooey Deschanel, is an oddball obsessed with the bird outside her window. Bradley Cooper plays Demo, another of Trip's friends, who is charming in his love of life.Oddly, we never find out the reasons behind the nicknames ""Trip"" and ""Demo"". Ace offers a quick line explaining his. Understanding these nicknames might have added a much needed layer to their characters.The true standouts in the supporting cast are Trip's parents played by Kathy Bates and Terry Bradshaw. Bates isn't very funny, but she is believable as a mom. Moments after sharing a complaint with her husband about their son still living with them, she serves Trip a large, homemade breakfast, enabling him to stay, but at the same time we see she has conflicts about whether he should stay. The banter she and Bradshaw share makes them seem like a real married couple. Bradshaw is funnier, as his character seems a little off. Now that he is retired, he is determined to enjoy life.Because the supporting cast is more interesting, more colorful and funnier, the two leads seem all the more wooden, creating an unbalanced film.The writers have also thrown in a lot of other strange things, most of which are designed to make the story unusual, but they do little to help make the film realistic or believable; Trip's `nephew' is a little African - American boy, various animals attack people throughout, Ace's home is wired with multiple webcams, blah, blah, blah.Failure To...Create Conflict...The conflict in ""Launch"" comes far too late in the film. Up until this moment everything is about Trip and Paula, their dates, and occasional interactions with their friends. Early on, Paula outlines the details of how she will win Trip over. Sure enough, it works like clock work until... she actually begins to fall for him. Come on. Like you didn't know that would happen.By the time an actual conflict develops, neither of the leads is appealing or interesting, so we really don't care. From the ""Meet Cute"" moment to the ""Make-Up Cute"" moment, they aren't real people. We just don't care enough about them.All in all, ""Launch"" is a...Oh, come on.

However, that is exactly the problem of this romantic comedy, of which premise depends on the lifestyle of one thirty-something guy named Tripp, who still lives with his parents. His girlfriends, it is shown early in the film, would not like it, even shocked to know that, and leaves him eventually.Now I don't know you, but if you fall for a guy like Tripp, as handsome as Matthew McConaughey, who has a good job (it seems) and owns a Porsche, will you dump him simply because he lives with parents? Yes, his mother (underused Kathy Bates) cooks for him and does his laundry, but it is still sexy McConaughey. In fact, another girl Paula shows up before him, played by delectable Sarah Jessica Parker, and falls in love with him. Apparently.As you see, Paula is actually hired by Tripp's parents, unbeknown to Tripp himself, in order to encourage their son to leave home. However, as I said, Paula really falls in love despite the fact he still lives with his parents because after all Tripp is so nice and charming. As the film's implausible story goes on, it gradually digresses from the initial premise about Tripp's `failure to launch' and begins to rely on romantic comedy clich&eacute; and silly and unfunny gags about animals biting poor characters, Terry Bradshaw's daddy posing naked (no, not frontal) or reviving the half-dead mockingbird shot by a BB gun. It is wonderful, even miraculous, to see actors shine in this messy script. Besides Matthew McConaughey and Sarah Jessica Parker, Zooey Deschanel is wonderful as Kit, Paula's sulky roommate with oddball personality, whose way of delivering lines is ten times funnier than the rest of the film.The film's tagline goes ""To leave the nest, some men just need a little push."" I don't know whether or not every man and woman should leave his `nest.' Or even so, I am not really sure parents need a woman's love to lure their son to be independent. Though the star power barely makes us forget the film's implausible story and its inept concept, the film still looks like a collection of concocted ideas from the notes jotted down on writer's memo, which probably it is.",2,Star Power of the Leads and Zooey Deschanel Saves This Romantic Comedy from Complete Failure,1175040000,"03 28, 2007",2007,2285,"['am', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'part', 'terrible', 'script', 'Failure', 'Launch', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'was', 'attracted', 'certain', 'star', 'power', 'However', 'exactly', 'problem', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'premise', 'lifestyle', 'one', 'thirty-something', 'guy', 'named', 'Tripp', 'who', 'still', 'parents', 'girlfriends', 'shown', 'early', 'film', 'would', 'not', 'like', 'even', 'shocked', 'know', 'eventually.Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'fall', 'guy', 'Tripp', 'as', 'handsome', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'who', 'good', 'job', 'Porsche', 'will', 'dump', 'simply', 'parents', 'Yes', 'mother', 'underused', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'laundry', 'still', 'sexy', 'McConaughey', 'fact', 'girl', 'Paula', 'up', 'played', 'delectable', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'love', 'Apparently.As', 'see', 'Paula', 'actually', 'hired', 'Tripp', 'parents', 'unbeknown', 'Tripp', 'order', 'encourage', 'son', 'leave', 'home', 'However', 'said', 'Paula', 'really', 'love', 'fact', 'still', 'parents', 'Tripp', 'so', 'nice', 'charming', 'film', 'implausible', 'story', 'gradually', 'initial', 'premise', 'Tripp', 'failure', 'launch', 'rely', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'clich', 'eacute', 'silly', 'unfunny', 'gags', 'animals', 'biting', 'poor', 'characters', 'Terry', 'Bradshaw', 'daddy', 'posing', 'naked', 'not', 'frontal', 'reviving', 'half-dead', 'mockingbird', 'shot', 'BB', 'gun', 'wonderful', 'even', 'miraculous', 'see', 'actors', 'shine', 'messy', 'script', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'wonderful', 'Kit', 'Paula', 'sulky', 'roommate', 'oddball', 'personality', 'way', 'delivering', 'lines', 'ten', 'times', 'funnier', 'rest', 'film.The', 'film', 'tagline', 'leave', 'nest', 'men', 'just', 'need', 'little', 'push', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'not', 'man', 'woman', 'should', 'leave', 'nest', 'even', 'so', 'am', 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'parents', 'need', 'woman', 'love', 'lure', 'son', 'be', 'independent', 'star', 'power', 'barely', 'forget', 'film', 'implausible', 'story', 'inept', 'concept', 'film', 'still', 'collection', 'concocted', 'ideas', 'notes', 'jotted', 'down', 'writer', 'memo', 'probably']",N/A
170851,A96K1ZGW56S2I,1415723702,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[5, 5]","Matthew McConaughey and Sarah Jessica Parker star in this romantic comedy about a thirty-something who still lives at home.  McConaughey plays Tripp, a thirty-something boat salesman who still lives with his parents in Baltimore, Maryland (surprisingly, Baltimore looks a lot like some of the towns in Western California, palm trees and all).  His parents, Al & Sue (played by Terry Bradshaw and Kathy Bates) love their son, but want him out of the house and in a place of his own.  Desperate, his parents call in a specialist, Paula (played by Sarah Jessica Parker).  Paula has made a job out of pretending to fall in love with men so that they will move out on their own.  The only problem is that Tripp isn't like the typical man Paula has worked with before:  he's tall, tan, dresses well, and earns good money.  All of her other previous clients apparently were short, fat, fan-boy types who could barely hold down a part-time job.  Paula ends up falling in love with Tripp.  Tripp realizes this and tries to get her to break up with him before things get serious.  Apparently Tripp likes women but is only interested in them long enough to get what he wants.  Tripp ends up falling for Paula and the two end up in a collision course that seems to derail, but is really nothing more than a pit stop.I was surprised and ended up enjoying FAILURE TO LAUNCH somewhat.  Most of this was because of the supporting cast.  Terry Bradshaw and Kathy Bates make a great couple and have some really funny lines.  However, all of the other performers are completely upstaged by the performances of Zooey Deschanel as Paula's housemate, Kit, and Justin Bartha as Tripp's best friend, Ace.  Ace originally appears as a kind of slacker fan-boy, kind of like the people that Paula normally help ""launch"" into their own lives.  But, Ace really isn't like that.  He ends up on a date with Kit as a bribe from Paula to keep quite about secrets he has unraveled.  The two end up becoming a pair after Ace uses a Red Ryder BB gun (thanks A CHRISTMAS STORY) to shoot a mockingbird outside her bedroom window that has given her insomnia for several weeks.  Deschanel and Bartha steal every scene they are in and their love story is more romantic than that of Tripp and Paula (not to mention how much better their acting is).FAILURE TO LAUNCH is a movie than many women will enjoy watching.  There are a few jokes that are aimed at guys, but the people who put this film together knew that the core audience of this film is women.  Still, with that in mind, I find some of the film's messages a bit disconcerting.  I realize that perception in the U.S. has changed dramatically recently, but there was a time in the U.S. when it was common, actually it was expected, that children would remain living at their family homes until they were married.  The family was the core and both men and women remained at home to support their families until they had families of their own.  Even after marriage, many families ended up living in the same homes and neighborhoods.  That idea of life seems to be lost in postmodern suburbia super-sized America, but it's actually the norm in most other countries of the world.  The movie also seems to say that unless you're a tall, thin, tan, handsome man, you really don't have much chance of ever being involved in a relationship (Ace looks more like an average Joe, but he's still too handsome).  As for women, the message seems to be that the only guys worth being in a relationship with are men who don't exist. These messages provide a lot of laughs, but fail to launch the movie into a realm of meaning and purpose.",3,Supporting Cast Rules,1148256000,"05 22, 2006",2006,3638,"['Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'star', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'thirty-something', 'who', 'still', 'home', 'McConaughey', 'Tripp', 'thirty-something', 'boat', 'salesman', 'who', 'still', 'parents', 'Baltimore', 'Maryland', 'surprisingly', 'Baltimore', 'lot', 'towns', 'Western', 'California', 'palm', 'trees', 'parents', 'Al', 'Sue', 'played', 'Terry', 'Bradshaw', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'love', 'son', 'want', 'house', 'place', 'own', 'Desperate', 'parents', 'call', 'specialist', 'Paula', 'played', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'Paula', 'made', 'job', 'pretending', 'fall', 'love', 'men', 'so', 'will', 'move', 'out', 'own', 'only', 'problem', 'Tripp', ""n't"", 'typical', 'man', 'Paula', 'worked', 'before', 'tall', 'tan', 'well', 'earns', 'good', 'money', 'other', 'previous', 'clients', 'apparently', 'were', 'short', 'fat', 'fan-boy', 'types', 'who', 'could', 'barely', 'hold', 'down', 'part-time', 'job', 'Paula', 'up', 'falling', 'love', 'Tripp', 'Tripp', 'get', 'break', 'up', 'things', 'get', 'serious', 'Apparently', 'Tripp', 'women', 'only', 'interested', 'long', 'enough', 'get', 'what', 'Tripp', 'up', 'falling', 'Paula', 'two', 'end', 'up', 'collision', 'course', 'derail', 'really', 'nothing', 'more', 'pit', 'stop.I', 'was', 'surprised', 'ended', 'up', 'enjoying', 'FAILURE', 'TO', 'LAUNCH', 'somewhat', 'Most', 'was', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Terry', 'Bradshaw', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'make', 'great', 'couple', 'have', 'really', 'funny', 'lines', 'However', 'other', 'performers', 'are', 'completely', 'upstaged', 'performances', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'Paula', 'housemate', 'Kit', 'Justin', 'Bartha', 'Tripp', 'best', 'friend', 'Ace', 'Ace', 'originally', 'kind', 'slacker', 'fan-boy', 'kind', 'people', 'Paula', 'normally', 'help', 'launch', 'own', 'lives', 'Ace', 'really', ""n't"", 'up', 'date', 'Kit', 'bribe', 'Paula', 'keep', 'quite', 'secrets', 'unraveled', 'two', 'end', 'up', 'becoming', 'pair', 'Ace', 'Red', 'Ryder', 'BB', 'gun', 'thanks', 'A', 'CHRISTMAS', 'STORY', 'shoot', 'mockingbird', 'bedroom', 'window', 'given', 'insomnia', 'several', 'weeks', 'Deschanel', 'Bartha', 'steal', 'scene', 'are', 'love', 'story', 'more', 'romantic', 'Tripp', 'Paula', 'not', 'mention', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'acting', '.FAILURE', 'TO', 'LAUNCH', 'movie', 'many', 'women', 'will', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'are', 'few', 'jokes', 'are', 'aimed', 'guys', 'people', 'who', 'put', 'film', 'together', 'knew', 'core', 'audience', 'film', 'women', 'Still', 'mind', 'find', 'film', 'messages', 'bit', 'disconcerting', 'realize', 'perception', 'U.S.', 'changed', 'dramatically', 'recently', 'there', 'was', 'time', 'U.S.', 'when', 'was', 'common', 'actually', 'was', 'expected', 'children', 'would', 'remain', 'living', 'family', 'homes', 'were', 'married', 'family', 'was', 'core', 'men', 'women', 'remained', 'home', 'support', 'families', 'had', 'families', 'own', 'Even', 'marriage', 'many', 'families', 'ended', 'up', 'living', 'same', 'homes', 'neighborhoods', 'idea', 'life', 'be', 'lost', 'postmodern', 'suburbia', 'super-sized', 'America', 'actually', 'norm', 'most', 'other', 'countries', 'world', 'movie', 'also', 'say', ""'re"", 'tall', 'thin', 'tan', 'handsome', 'man', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'chance', 'ever', 'being', 'involved', 'relationship', 'Ace', 'more', 'average', 'Joe', 'still', 'too', 'handsome', 'women', 'message', 'be', 'only', 'guys', 'worth', 'being', 'relationship', 'are', 'men', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'exist', 'messages', 'provide', 'lot', 'laughs', 'fail', 'launch', 'movie', 'realm', 'meaning', 'purpose']",N/A
170852,A2CDMCG1Z84A51,1415723702,Wanda B. Red,"[3, 3]","Paula makes a career out of being hired by aging boomer parents who want to get their adult sons out of the house. This she accomplishes by pretending to fall in love with them, thus building their confidence so they can fly mommy's nest. A stunningly stupid concept for a film. Apparently her clients usually are so pumped up by her attentions that they don't notice, or don't mind that at the end she dumps them. Also, while the movie attempts to face the problem head-on, the sex part (whether or not it's consummated and it is here -- whoops, spoiler!) kind of makes Paula like a prostitute. Oh well, never mind.That's what's bad about this movie. But it also shows that, if you simply grab a stupid idea vigorously enough about its horns and ride it all the way to the finish, you might end up with something pretty entertaining, which is also what this film is. It never seems to harbor serious doubts about what it's doing (even when it turns out that father wanted son out of the house so he could have a ""naked room,"" what the heck?). The reader is finally worn down, and there is nothing left to do but come along for the ride. The final scene (I won't describe it, but for the most part it cleverly brings together all the preposterous and bizarre characters and subplots) does offer a pretty satisfying payoff. The actors are part of what makes this film work: Sarah Jessica Parker, Matthew McConaughey, Kathy Bates, Terry Bradshaw gamely throw themselves into this absurdity.Even so, ""Failure to Launch"" certainly doesn't deserve more than three stars, even if it almost manages to make folly funny.",3,Bizarre,1158624000,"09 19, 2006",2006,1612,"['Paula', 'career', 'being', 'hired', 'aging', 'boomer', 'parents', 'who', 'want', 'get', 'adult', 'sons', 'house', 'pretending', 'fall', 'love', 'thus', 'building', 'confidence', 'can', 'fly', 'mommy', 'nest', 'stunningly', 'stupid', 'concept', 'film', 'Apparently', 'clients', 'usually', 'are', 'so', 'pumped', 'up', 'attentions', 'do', ""n't"", 'notice', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'end', 'Also', 'movie', 'attempts', 'face', 'problem', 'head-on', 'sex', 'part', 'not', 'consummated', 'here', 'whoops', 'spoiler', 'kind', 'Paula', 'prostitute', 'Oh', 'well', 'never', 'what', 'bad', 'movie', 'also', 'simply', 'grab', 'stupid', 'idea', 'vigorously', 'enough', 'horns', 'ride', 'way', 'finish', 'might', 'end', 'up', 'something', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'also', 'what', 'film', 'never', 'harbor', 'serious', 'doubts', 'what', 'doing', 'even', 'when', 'out', 'father', 'wanted', 'son', 'house', 'could', 'have', 'naked', 'room', 'what', 'heck', 'reader', 'finally', 'worn', 'down', 'nothing', 'left', 'do', 'come', 'along', 'ride', 'final', 'scene', 'wo', ""n't"", 'describe', 'most', 'part', 'cleverly', 'together', 'preposterous', 'bizarre', 'characters', 'subplots', 'offer', 'pretty', 'satisfying', 'payoff', 'actors', 'are', 'part', 'what', 'film', 'work', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'Terry', 'Bradshaw', 'gamely', 'throw', 'absurdity.Even', 'so', 'Failure', 'Launch', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'more', 'three', 'stars', 'even', 'almost', 'make', 'folly', 'funny']",N/A
