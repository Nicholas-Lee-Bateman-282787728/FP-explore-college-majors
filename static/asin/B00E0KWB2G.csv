1663450,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00E0KWB2G,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 1]","Sadly, most people haven&#8217;t heard of &#8216;A Hijacking&#8217;, and many who have read the synopsis and said &#8220;this is just &#8216;Captain Phillips&#8217; with subtitles&#8221; and decided to skip it altogether.  I have to admit, as much as I&#8217;m an avid foreign film advocate, I almost skipped it for the very same reason.  &#8216;Captain Phillips&#8217; was still fresh in my mind and the idea of watching a film that appeared to be a very similar narrative had me uninterested.I&#8217;ve learned many times over to never judge a book by its cover, and here is yet another reason why that is just poor judgment.First things first, this does carry a similar storyline as the aforementioned Oscar nominee.  Concerning a Danish cargo ship as opposed to an American one (and not being a true story, at least not in the direct sense), &#8216;A Hijacking&#8217; follows a different narrative than &#8216;Captain Phillips&#8217; did.  This really shouldn&#8217;t be about which film was better, because they were both very different.  I will say that I appreciated Paul Greengrass&#8217;s direction more, for despite having a film that was almost an hour longer than Lindholm&#8217;s, his film felt tighter and more focused (and only spanned a few days, whereas &#8216;A Hijacking&#8217; covers almost half a year).  While I did prefer &#8216;Captain Phillips&#8217; as a whole, they are different experiences altogether, and &#8216;A Hijacking&#8217; is not without its fair share of merit.Splitting its time between the hijacked ship and the Copenhagen authorities, &#8216;A Hijacking&#8217; tries to cover a wider scope of circumstance than &#8216;Captain Phillips&#8217; did, which was content with staying on target and following its two stars from scene to scene.  Instead, we are given dire circumstances of the cargo ship&#8217;s quarters and the men trying to stay alive aboard as well as the stuffy and stress filled atmosphere inside buildings and office spaces as the higher ups attempt to resolve the issue without suffering too large a financial loss.  While the selfish business side of things was hinted at in Greengrass&#8217;s film, it is exploited heavily here, and to devastating effect.The cast really rises to the occasion and makes this film sink down in the themes presented.  At the forefront is Pilou Asbaek and Soren Malling who play the chief protagonists on their end of the spectrum.  Asbaek delivers a heart wrenching performance (such layers) as Mikkel, the chef aboard the hijacked ship who misses his wife and daughter.  Malling portrays the conflicted Ludvigsen who is desperate to get his men home but is torn between business advisors who don&#8217;t want to play their hand too quickly.For me, despite the brisk running time and shared vantage points, &#8216;A Hijacking&#8217; isn&#8217;t as focused as I wanted it to be.  Maybe the juggling of multiple characters played against it slightly, but it is odd for me to feel that a film an hour longer and concerning a much shorting time span could be tighter and more streamlined than this one, but it is true.  Still, this is a harrowing look at the effects these situations have on those who endure them, and Asbaek&#8217;s tremendous performance is hard to shake.  Just the way he allows the world around him to overtake him in those final frames (the gunshot, his stare, that ring, his eyes) is unforgettable.For those on the fence about taking this one in, I strongly recommend that you do.",4,This is not just another 'Captain Phillips'...,1394496000,"03 11, 2014",2014,3491,"['Sadly', 'most', 'people', 'haven', '8217', 'heard', '8216', 'A', 'Hijacking', '8217', 'many', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'synopsis', 'said', '8220', 'just', '8216', 'Captain', 'Phillips', '8217', 'subtitles', '8221', 'decided', 'skip', 'altogether', 'have', 'admit', 'as', 'much', '8217', 'avid', 'foreign', 'film', 'advocate', 'almost', 'skipped', 'very', 'same', 'reason', '8216', 'Captain', 'Phillips', '8217', 'was', 'still', 'fresh', 'mind', 'idea', 'watching', 'film', 'appeared', 'be', 'very', 'similar', 'narrative', 'had', 'uninterested.I', '8217', 'learned', 'many', 'times', 'never', 'judge', 'book', 'cover', 'here', 'yet', 'reason', 'why', 'just', 'poor', 'judgment.First', 'things', 'first', 'carry', 'similar', 'storyline', 'aforementioned', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'Concerning', 'Danish', 'cargo', 'ship', 'opposed', 'American', 'one', 'not', 'being', 'true', 'story', 'least', 'not', 'direct', 'sense', '8216', 'A', 'Hijacking', '8217', 'different', 'narrative', '8216', 'Captain', 'Phillips', '8217', 'did', 'really', 'shouldn', '8217', 'be', 'film', 'was', 'better', 'were', 'very', 'different', 'will', 'say', 'appreciated', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', '8217', 'direction', 'more', 'having', 'film', 'was', 'almost', 'hour', 'longer', 'Lindholm', '8217', 'film', 'felt', 'tighter', 'more', 'focused', 'only', 'spanned', 'few', 'days', 'whereas', '8216', 'A', 'Hijacking', '8217', 'almost', 'year', 'did', 'prefer', '8216', 'Captain', 'Phillips', '8217', 'whole', 'are', 'different', 'experiences', 'altogether', '8216', 'A', 'Hijacking', '8217', 'not', 'fair', 'share', 'merit.Splitting', 'time', 'hijacked', 'ship', 'Copenhagen', 'authorities', '8216', 'A', 'Hijacking', '8217', 'tries', 'cover', 'wider', 'scope', 'circumstance', '8216', 'Captain', 'Phillips', '8217', 'did', 'was', 'content', 'staying', 'target', 'following', 'two', 'stars', 'scene', 'scene', 'Instead', 'are', 'given', 'dire', 'circumstances', 'cargo', 'ship', '8217', 'quarters', 'men', 'trying', 'stay', 'alive', 'aboard', 'as', 'well', 'stuffy', 'stress', 'filled', 'atmosphere', 'inside', 'buildings', 'office', 'spaces', 'higher', 'ups', 'attempt', 'resolve', 'issue', 'suffering', 'too', 'large', 'financial', 'loss', 'selfish', 'business', 'side', 'things', 'was', 'hinted', 'Greengrass', '8217', 'film', 'exploited', 'heavily', 'here', 'devastating', 'effect.The', 'cast', 'really', 'occasion', 'film', 'sink', 'down', 'themes', 'presented', 'forefront', 'Pilou', 'Asbaek', 'Soren', 'Malling', 'who', 'play', 'chief', 'protagonists', 'end', 'spectrum', 'Asbaek', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'performance', 'such', 'layers', 'Mikkel', 'chef', 'hijacked', 'ship', 'who', 'wife', 'daughter', 'Malling', 'conflicted', 'Ludvigsen', 'who', 'desperate', 'get', 'men', 'home', 'torn', 'business', 'advisors', 'who', 'don', '8217', 'want', 'play', 'hand', 'too', 'quickly.For', 'brisk', 'running', 'time', 'shared', 'vantage', 'points', '8216', 'A', 'Hijacking', '8217', '8217', 'as', 'focused', 'wanted', 'be', 'Maybe', 'juggling', 'multiple', 'characters', 'played', 'slightly', 'odd', 'feel', 'film', 'hour', 'longer', 'concerning', 'much', 'shorting', 'time', 'span', 'could', 'be', 'tighter', 'more', 'streamlined', 'one', 'true', 'Still', 'harrowing', 'look', 'effects', 'situations', 'have', 'who', 'endure', 'Asbaek', '8217', 'tremendous', 'performance', 'hard', 'shake', 'Just', 'way', 'world', 'overtake', 'final', 'frames', 'gunshot', 'stare', 'ring', 'eyes', 'unforgettable.For', 'fence', 'taking', 'one', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'do']",A Hijacking

1663452,A1E6JS6C205VZD,B00E0KWB2G,Dr. Laurence Raw,"[0, 0]","Based on real-life events, Tobias Lindholm's drama focuses on the consequences of a hijacking of a Danish cargo ship bound for India by Somali pirates.  What sets it apart from other hijacking films is its focus on the delicate negotiations between the pirates, their mediator Omar (Abdihakin Asgar), and Peter Ludvigsen, the CEO of the cargo ship company (Soren Malling) back in Copenhagen.  We understand the delicate bargaining process; how the pirates are quite prepared to sit it out until they achieve what they want, and how it is imperative that Peter should keep control of his emotions.  To do otherwise would be to cede the advantage to the pirates.  In several sequences of unbearable tension in the situation room in Copenhagen, we watch Peter being advised by hijacking specialist Connor Julian (Gary Skjoldmose Porter), while struggling to maintain his calm.  Meanwhile, back on the cargo ship, director Lindholm shows how the hijacking affects the crew, especially ship's cook Mikkel Hartmann (Pilou Asbk).  Eventually he almost cracks up under the strain, as he is shown cowering in a corner, unable to move or speak.  Even when he is finally restored to his family, he can hardly raise a smile.  THE HIJACKING is an intense film: Lindholm's camera focuses relentlessly on the characters' facial expressions.  A gesture, or even a blink of an eye, denotes a change of emotion.  The performances are uniformly excellent - especially Malling, who is shown at the end getting into his car and driving off.  This is something he might do on any normal day, but this time he walks in silence, staring blankly into space; not exactly ruined, but profoundly scarred by the experience.",4,A Battle of Wills (and Wits) Fought Out in Denmark and Asia,1390608000,"01 25, 2014",2014,1694,"['Based', 'real-life', 'events', 'Tobias', 'Lindholm', 'drama', 'consequences', 'hijacking', 'Danish', 'cargo', 'ship', 'bound', 'India', 'Somali', 'pirates', 'What', 'apart', 'other', 'hijacking', 'films', 'focus', 'delicate', 'negotiations', 'pirates', 'mediator', 'Omar', 'Abdihakin', 'Asgar', 'Peter', 'Ludvigsen', 'CEO', 'cargo', 'ship', 'company', 'Soren', 'Malling', 'back', 'Copenhagen', 'understand', 'delicate', 'bargaining', 'process', 'how', 'pirates', 'are', 'quite', 'prepared', 'sit', 'out', 'achieve', 'what', 'want', 'how', 'imperative', 'Peter', 'should', 'keep', 'control', 'emotions', 'do', 'otherwise', 'would', 'be', 'cede', 'advantage', 'pirates', 'several', 'sequences', 'unbearable', 'tension', 'situation', 'room', 'Copenhagen', 'watch', 'Peter', 'being', 'advised', 'hijacking', 'specialist', 'Connor', 'Julian', 'Gary', 'Skjoldmose', 'Porter', 'struggling', 'maintain', 'calm', 'Meanwhile', 'back', 'cargo', 'ship', 'director', 'Lindholm', 'how', 'hijacking', 'crew', 'especially', 'ship', 'cook', 'Mikkel', 'Hartmann', 'Pilou', 'Asbk', 'Eventually', 'almost', 'up', 'strain', 'shown', 'cowering', 'corner', 'unable', 'move', 'speak', 'Even', 'when', 'finally', 'restored', 'family', 'can', 'hardly', 'raise', 'smile', 'HIJACKING', 'intense', 'film', 'Lindholm', 'camera', 'relentlessly', 'characters', 'facial', 'expressions', 'gesture', 'even', 'blink', 'eye', 'change', 'emotion', 'performances', 'are', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'especially', 'Malling', 'who', 'shown', 'end', 'getting', 'car', 'driving', 'off', 'something', 'might', 'do', 'normal', 'day', 'time', 'silence', 'staring', 'blankly', 'space', 'not', 'exactly', 'ruined', 'profoundly', 'scarred', 'experience']",A Hijacking

""A Hijacking"" (""Kapringen"") is the latest of a handful of solid Danish dramas that I've seen in the past couple of years. It follows the plights, and deteriorating mental states, of two men touched by the hijacking of a cargo ship. The Danish ship the MV Rozen, en route to Mumbai, is hijacked by Somali pirates in the Indian Ocean. The ship's cook Mikkel (Pilou Asbk) is particularly harassed by the pirates, as they always want to be fed. In Denmark, the shipping company's CEO Peter (Sren Malling) has the weight of the world on his shoulders as he attempts an interminable negotiation with the pirates though their intermediary and translator Omar (Abdihakin Asgar).Tobias Lindholm both wrote and directed ""A Hijacking"". The ship's scenes were genuinely filmed on a ship, for which the audience is grateful once we get out of the cramped quarters to which the hostages have been confined. I was pretty glad to see the sea and sunshine too. Mikkel interacts primarily with his captors and with the Captain (Keith Pearson), who has taken ill, and the friendly Chief Engineer (Roland Mller). It's a good performance, but Mikkel's arc seems contrived in the end, which I think is the film's only flaw. It's Peter the CEO who got my sympathy. He is an expert negotiator who feels he can function in that role better than anyone so ignores the advice of a specialist to use an outside negotiator. In doing so, he places himself in an impossible predicament, waiting constantly for a phone call, only to refuse the pirates' demands and wait...repeatedly.The DVD (Magnolia 2013): There is a trailer and a ""Behind the Scenes"" featurette (15 min) in five parts. Director Tobias Lindholm comments while on location, as do the actors. The most interesting part concerns the real story that inspired the film: the hijacking by pirates of a Danish cargo vessel belonging to The Clipper Group in 2008. Their CEO Per Gullestrop, who looks a bit like Peter in the movie, is interviewed. He was apparently on the set at times and an advisor on the film. A member of that crew that was hijacked, Chief Engineer Juma Mvita, who has a small role in the film, is also interviewed. The film is in Danish with optional English subtitles.

1663456,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00E0KWB2G,M. Oleson,"[3, 3]","Danish director and screenwriter Tobias Lindholm delivers a taut thriller in an unusual and certainly non-Hollywood way.  Using a documentary style complete with hand held cameras, Lindholm captures the hijacking of Danish cargo ship MV Rozen and the subsequent negotiations between the pirates and the corporate CEO to get the crew released.The Danes don't have the military might of America to come to their rescue so the give and take between pirate negotiator Omar (Abdihakin Asgar) and Peter (Soren Malling) create the primary focus.  But this isn't one of those quickly negotiated settlements.  It lasts 7 months.  Seven months of hell for the crew of the Rozen and their families.  The brutality of the pirates is mostly limited to psychological mistreatment, compounded by a lack of food, water and sanitation.  And Lindholm lays it all out there for the viewer to experience.The captain of the ship becomes ill, so Lindholm centers in on the ship's cook, Mikkel (superb Pilou Asbaek).  His original upbeat persona gives way to deep depression as isolation and deteriorating conditions take their toll.  The film splits its time between being on the ship and being in the corporate boardroom.  Like most financial negotiations, it's just a matter of time as the two side each throw figures at each other that will eventually get the crew released.  Just what is the price for their freedom?While the pirates are certainly seen as bad guys, they do have moments of humanity.  This is most evident when the crew persuades the pirates to allow them to fish off the side of the ship.  This brings in a nice catch which crew and captors both celebrate.  Alas, the pirate's soon resort to their jobs of intimidation.  This isn't an easy film to watch at times.

So glad I did.""A Hijacking"" (2012 release from Denmark; 103 min.) brings the story of the crew on a container ship which is on the Indian Ocean on its way to Mumbai, but gets hijacked by a group of Somali pirates. As the movie opens, we get to know Mikkel, the Danish cook on the ship, making a phone call to his wife and young daughter. We also get to know Peter, the CEO of the shipping company back in Denmark. We learn of the hijacking when Peter gets a note slipped in front of him during a meeting. Peter hires a consultant who has experience dealing with this particular situation. Meanwhile, back on the ship, the crew is not treated well by the pirates, and I'm being mild, as the days and weeks go by, while the translator for the pirates and the CEO are trading phone calls over the release money. The pirates are asking a ransom of $12 million and the CEO initially counters with $250,000. Will they come to a resolution? Will the crew make it back home safely? To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: first and foremost, this is one tough and chilling, but ultimately riveting movie. The events in this movie are apparently a composite of real life events that have happened involving modern day sea piracy. Beware: this movie is not for the faint of heart.  The crew gets subjected to all kinds of physical and psychological abuse by the pirates. There are a number of scenes for which I simply closed my eyes, there is no ""Hollywood sugarcoating"" in this movie! Second, writer-director Tobias Lindholm, making his debut with this, shows a lot of promise with this strong movie. At one point in the movie, Mikkel, now weeks into the hijacking, finally gets to make a phone call to his wife (being pressured by the pirates to tell her to call the CEO and beg him to pay the ransom). As soon as Mikkel's wife hears his voice, she falls apart emotionally, and so do we the viewers, as this scene simply punches you in the gut. Here's hoping that this does NOT get a Hollywood remake, as happens so often with superior foreign movies. What would be the point of such a remake? The movie has been made already, and perfectly well at that. There is an upcoming release from Hollywood in October called ""Captain Phillips"" (starring Tom Hanks) with a similar theme, but from the trailer I've seen it's light years away from this movie as it's marketed as an action movie, which ""A Hijacking"" surely is not.If you are in the mood for a top quality foreign movie that will have you on the edge of your seat, ""A Hijacking"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",4,Chilling but riveting hostage/negotiation drama from Denmark,1374364800,"07 21, 2013",2013,2767,"['caught', 'movie', 'just', 'weekend', 'here', 'Cincinnati', 'presentation', 'non-profit', 'Cincinnati', 'World', 'Cinema', 'So', 'glad', 'did', 'Hijacking', '2012', 'release', 'Denmark', '103', 'min', 'story', 'crew', 'container', 'ship', 'Indian', 'Ocean', 'way', 'Mumbai', 'hijacked', 'group', 'Somali', 'pirates', 'movie', 'get', 'know', 'Mikkel', 'Danish', 'cook', 'ship', 'making', 'phone', 'call', 'wife', 'young', 'daughter', 'also', 'get', 'know', 'Peter', 'CEO', 'shipping', 'company', 'back', 'Denmark', 'learn', 'hijacking', 'when', 'Peter', 'note', 'slipped', 'front', 'meeting', 'Peter', 'consultant', 'who', 'experience', 'dealing', 'particular', 'situation', 'Meanwhile', 'back', 'ship', 'crew', 'not', 'treated', 'well', 'pirates', ""'m"", 'being', 'mild', 'days', 'weeks', 'go', 'translator', 'pirates', 'CEO', 'are', 'trading', 'phone', 'release', 'money', 'pirates', 'are', 'asking', 'ransom', '12', 'million', 'CEO', 'initially', '250,000', 'Will', 'come', 'resolution', 'Will', 'crew', 'make', 'back', 'home', 'safely', 'tell', 'more', 'plot', 'would', 'ruin', 'viewing', 'experience', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'see', 'how', 'out.Several', 'comments', 'first', 'foremost', 'one', 'tough', 'chilling', 'ultimately', 'riveting', 'movie', 'events', 'movie', 'are', 'apparently', 'composite', 'real', 'life', 'events', 'have', 'happened', 'involving', 'modern', 'day', 'sea', 'piracy', 'Beware', 'movie', 'not', 'faint', 'heart', 'crew', 'subjected', 'kinds', 'physical', 'psychological', 'abuse', 'pirates', 'are', 'number', 'scenes', 'simply', 'closed', 'eyes', 'Hollywood', 'sugarcoating', 'movie', 'Second', 'writer-director', 'Tobias', 'Lindholm', 'making', 'debut', 'lot', 'promise', 'strong', 'movie', 'one', 'point', 'movie', 'Mikkel', 'now', 'weeks', 'hijacking', 'finally', 'make', 'phone', 'call', 'wife', 'being', 'pressured', 'pirates', 'tell', 'call', 'CEO', 'beg', 'pay', 'ransom', 'As', 'soon', 'Mikkel', 'wife', 'voice', 'apart', 'emotionally', 'so', 'do', 'viewers', 'scene', 'simply', 'gut', 'Here', 'hoping', 'NOT', 'get', 'Hollywood', 'remake', 'happens', 'so', 'often', 'superior', 'foreign', 'movies', 'What', 'would', 'be', 'point', 'such', 'remake', 'movie', 'been', 'made', 'already', 'perfectly', 'well', 'upcoming', 'release', 'Hollywood', 'October', 'called', 'Captain', 'Phillips', 'starring', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'similar', 'theme', 'trailer', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'light', 'years', 'away', 'movie', 'marketed', 'action', 'movie', 'Hijacking', 'surely', 'not.If', 'are', 'mood', 'top', 'quality', 'foreign', 'movie', 'will', 'have', 'edge', 'seat', 'Hijacking', 'HIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED']",A Hijacking

1663463,A1Y2GZGBMICFG8,B00E0KWB2G,The Separator,"[0, 0]","Quick, precise, and severe, the film spends little time on the mechanics of how the pirates actually board. This is not an action film. We learn that a high-speed boat has approached and boarded effortlessly, that&#8217;s it. More important to the film is what happens while the pirates are onboard.The first thing the pirates do, even before starting negotiations for money, is demand food. The ship&#8217;s cook, played brilliantly by Danish actor Pilou Asbaek, becomes the pirate&#8217;s gopher, and an ad-hoc negotiator between the pirates and the ship&#8217;s owners.Conditions onboard are miserable. Shocking even. The cook and 2 other crewmen are kept in a small closet for weeks, four other crewmembers below deck. They&#8217;re not allowed out to relive themselves in a toilet; they must use a corner of the room. My training on ships did not include images like these. There was no training about how to interact with maniacs with automatic weapons.The job of casting the actors that play the pirates is ingenious. All the actor&#8217;s performances are in the Somali language (I think). Their interactions with the ship&#8217;s crew are so authentic that I&#8217;m guessing none of these men were trained actors. Probably just local Somali men recruited by the casting director, but I can&#8217;t verify this. If they were actors, they&#8217;re the best I&#8217;ve ever seen.Contentious negotiations between the ship&#8217;s owners and the pirates leave questions. The hijacking ends without incident, almost, but the negotiations take months. Could the ship&#8217;s owner have done more? Given in to the pirate&#8217;s demands sooner? Gotten the crew home faster? Undoubtedly questions that need to be asked of the real hijackings that take place routinely in the Gulf, where we get little more than a single paragraph in the news about some, and no more.Errata: There is no military presence here. It seems unlikely that a cargo ship would be held hostage for months without attracting some kind of military presence. The fact that the all the negotiations themselves are handled by the shipping company, and are not handed over to the military entirely seems implausable, especially when compared to the Greengrass version where the military handles everything.Get more reviews at getthebonesaw.blogspot.com",5,A Severe and Intense Experience,1388448000,"12 31, 2013",2013,2321,"['Quick', 'precise', 'severe', 'film', 'little', 'time', 'mechanics', 'how', 'pirates', 'actually', 'board', 'not', 'action', 'film', 'learn', 'high-speed', 'boat', 'approached', 'boarded', 'effortlessly', '8217', 's', 'More', 'important', 'film', 'what', 'pirates', 'are', 'onboard.The', 'first', 'thing', 'pirates', 'do', 'even', 'starting', 'negotiations', 'money', 'demand', 'food', 'ship', '8217', 'cook', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Danish', 'actor', 'Pilou', 'Asbaek', 'pirate', '8217', 'gopher', 'ad-hoc', 'negotiator', 'pirates', 'ship', '8217', 's', 'owners.Conditions', 'onboard', 'are', 'miserable', 'Shocking', 'even', 'cook', '2', 'other', 'crewmen', 'are', 'kept', 'small', 'closet', 'weeks', 'four', 'other', 'crewmembers', 'deck', '8217', 'not', 'allowed', 'out', 'relive', 'toilet', 'must', 'use', 'corner', 'room', 'training', 'ships', 'did', 'not', 'include', 'images', 'was', 'training', 'how', 'interact', 'maniacs', 'automatic', 'weapons.The', 'job', 'casting', 'actors', 'play', 'pirates', 'ingenious', 'actor', '8217', 's', 'performances', 'are', 'Somali', 'language', 'think', 'interactions', 'ship', '8217', 'crew', 'are', 'so', 'authentic', '8217', 'guessing', 'none', 'men', 'were', 'trained', 'actors', 'Probably', 'just', 'local', 'Somali', 'men', 'recruited', 'casting', 'director', 'can', '8217', 'verify', 'were', 'actors', '8217', 're', 'best', '8217', 'ever', 'seen.Contentious', 'negotiations', 'ship', '8217', 's', 'owners', 'pirates', 'leave', 'questions', 'hijacking', 'ends', 'incident', 'almost', 'negotiations', 'take', 'months', 'Could', 'ship', '8217', 'owner', 'have', 'done', 'more', 'Given', 'pirate', '8217', 's', 'demands', 'sooner', 'Gotten', 'crew', 'home', 'faster', 'Undoubtedly', 'questions', 'need', 'be', 'asked', 'real', 'hijackings', 'take', 'place', 'routinely', 'Gulf', 'where', 'get', 'little', 'more', 'single', 'paragraph', 'news', 'more.Errata', 'military', 'presence', 'here', 'unlikely', 'cargo', 'ship', 'would', 'be', 'held', 'hostage', 'months', 'attracting', 'kind', 'military', 'presence', 'fact', 'negotiations', 'are', 'handled', 'shipping', 'company', 'are', 'not', 'handed', 'military', 'entirely', 'implausable', 'especially', 'when', 'compared', 'Greengrass', 'version', 'where', 'military', 'handles', 'everything.Get', 'more', 'reviews', 'getthebonesaw.blogspot.com']",A Hijacking
1663464,A2YKADCJME4FSW,B00E0KWB2G,Tom Birkenstock,"[0, 0]","It&#8217;s an odd coincidence that two films about Somali pirates were released last year.  While all the public attention and critical praise has flowed towards the Tom Hanks vehicle, Captain Phillips, the Danish film, A Hijacking, is arguably much more of an artistic triumph.  If you were to watch these films back to back, it would be easy to see why Phillips has garnered so much attention: it is flashier, has bigger stars, and celebrates the triumph of American military force.  By contrast, A Hijacking is a much more subdued, but no less suspenseful, affair.  Where Captain Phillips is about ordinary people thrust into extraordinary circumstances, A Hijacking is about extraordinary circumstances fitted into ordinary business practices.The narrative of A Hijacking is split between the men on the boat and the men from the boardroom. On the boat we mostly follow the ship&#8217;s cook who we are introduced to in the first scene as he tells his wife that he will be out to sea longer than expected and will miss his daughter&#8217;s birthday.  Although his name is listed as Mikkel, most people, even those trying to negotiate his release, mostly just refer to him as the cook.  While the cook and the crew strategize about how they might survive this ordeal, there aren&#8217;t any last minute heroics.  At best, the cook and a colleague attempt to befriend a particularly unstable pirate with the hopes that this will make it less likely he will execute them; at worst, the cook&#8217;s desperation to get home to his family is used as a bargaining tool by the Somali negotiator, Omar.But the film is just as interested in how the Danish company who owns the boat handles the hijacking.  While the hijacking isn&#8217;t an everyday occurrence, events like this are apparently common enough for the company to call in an expert in negotiating with Somali pirates.  The negotiation expert recommends that the company brings in one of his men to engage directly with the pirates, but the suit in charge, Peter, decides that he wants to handle the negotiations himself.  Early on we see Peter play hardball with several Japanese businessmen, so we know he is competent, and he is coached through the process by the negotiation expert, but the audience knows that Peter&#8217;s decision is part hubris.  In a sense, he&#8217;s like a much more competent, much less coked up version of Ellis from Die Hard.As explained early on, these negotiations can stretch on nearly interminably.  And the film does a good job of illustrating how time wears down all of those involved.  In this instance, the hostage negotiation lasts for months. And while early on Peter expertly deals with the pirates in the manner he has been coached, eventually the day in, day out pressure of the situation begins to erode his cool, Danish exterior.  It was also interesting to see the negotiation expert explain certain tactics.  For instance, Peter cannot immediately give in to the Somali&#8217;s initial demands, not necessarily because it will be too costly, but because once the pirates know the company is willing to shell out some big bucks, they will find a way to draw out the negotiation longer and ask for more.As the article &#8220;A&#8221; in the title suggests, this particular hijacking is often treated as the cost of doing business.  It&#8217;s unusual, but not unexpected.  One of the more interesting characters in the film is Omar, who speaks English and negotiates on behalf of the Somali pirates, although he takes umbrage when Peter suggests that Omar is himself a pirate.  Throughout the negotiating process, both Omar and Peter attempt to maintain a cordial relationship, although it naturally breaks down over time.  It&#8217;s easy to view this film as the clashing of two cultures within a global marketplace.  They&#8217;re making a business deal, but it just so happens that one party has brought weapons to the negotiating table.A Hijacking makes a fascinating comparison to the style of Paul Greengrass, the director of Captain Phillips.  Both films take on a cinema verite, documentary aesthetic.  But where Greengrass prefers to haphazardly throw his cameras about to mimic the intensity of the situation, A Hijacking director, Tobias Lindholm, uses his cameras in a manner similar to an actual documentary.  In other words, he uses handhelds, but he does not purposefully engage in frenetic jostling.  Greengrass uses the veneer of a documentary in order to reveal the subjective state of the characters in the film, but Lindholm seems interested in maintaining a calm distance from the procedures.  Arguably, this less frantic take provides the film with a more grounded feeling.Beyond the individual narrative of Captain Philips, stories of Somali pirates are fascinating because they&#8217;re examples of desperate people from a failed state using what seems like anachronistic tactics to force their way into streams of global capital.  Perhaps better than the Hollywood blockbuster version of this story, A Hijacking illustrates ways in which men are trapped within a world and economy they have no real control over.  It&#8217;s eerie to hear Peter negotiate over numbers when men&#8217;s lives are on the line.  It&#8217;s an unsettling reminder that within this system the value of our lives can be reduced to a number written on a marker board in a conference room.",4,A Tense Look at Pirates in a Globalized
