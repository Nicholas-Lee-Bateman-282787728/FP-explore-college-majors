In the very first episode (1 of 9) it displayed the U.S soldiers as drunken, woman chasing, disgusting men who were not even very good actors. Referring to the Vietnamese owner of the bar as 'mamma-san', and them referred themselves as her #1 boy. A brawl breaks out (in the bar - not the battlefield) and again it portals the soldiers using the common terms and slang's that were used in vietnam but they used them in the first 20 minutes of the movie.. (that was as long as I would stand) I probably should not judge the entire 9 episodes by the first 20 minutes of this movie but to a person who spent his time in this country (never getting as far south as Saigon) this was an insult to myself and all the others Marines I served with. I wonder if there is a way to refund this DVD. But I should have been tipped off by the low price of the movie. I would not recommend this movie to anyone....",1,"My thoughts on the movie ""Vietnam War Story""",1403827200,"06 27, 2014",2014,951,"['NOT', 'what', 'expected', 'when', 'ordered', 'DVD', 'very', 'first', 'episode', '1', '9', 'displayed', 'U.S', 'soldiers', 'drunken', 'woman', 'chasing', 'disgusting', 'men', 'who', 'were', 'not', 'even', 'very', 'good', 'actors', 'Referring', 'Vietnamese', 'owner', 'bar', ""'mamma-san"", 'referred', '1', 'boy', 'brawl', 'out', 'bar', 'not', 'battlefield', 'again', 'soldiers', 'using', 'common', 'terms', 'slang', 'were', 'used', 'vietnam', 'used', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'movie..', 'was', 'as', 'long', 'would', 'stand', 'probably', 'should', 'not', 'judge', 'entire', '9', 'episodes', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'movie', 'person', 'who', 'spent', 'time', 'country', 'never', 'getting', 'far', 'south', 'Saigon', 'was', 'insult', 'myself', 'others', 'Marines', 'served', 'wonder', 'way', 'refund', 'DVD', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'tipped', 'off', 'low', 'price', 'movie', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone']",N/A

Sorensen ""Old Keen Eye""","[8, 14]","If you are wanting to see a film that is well acted, if you are wanting to see a film that has a strong basis in history, if you are wanting to see a film that gives you a sense of the realities of Vietnam, if you are wanting to use your time wisely by watching something of value then this is NOT the movie for you. I was hoping that this would be a well acted and thoughtful dramatization of some actual events that occured in Vietnam, but it was not. What it was waas an old and rather cheesy film that had no substance to it whatsoever. There isn't enough bad things I can say about this, it truly sucked. Also, a warning to all of you who care, this movie does contain a lot of swearing (the F word) and gratuitous female nudity. (Which IMO is different than the nudity on something like ""Taxi Cab to the Dark Side"" which shows male nudity to strengthen the thesis of the film.)In any case.
