When the film first opened, I wanted to congratulate the editor, in the way he (she?) moved from static images to real life. It was excellent. But then, people started to talk. My take, in the five minutes I gave this film a chance, is that the screenplay and the acting are both rather blas&eacute;.

It's a movie about a bunch of drunks with poor prospects in life primarily due to their own personal lack of discipline.  I'm sorry, but this was about as depressing of a movie as I have watched (and I seriously considered turning it off on several occasions) as it puts into focus how really hopeless some people are - not because they don't have the brains, ability, or talent, but because they simply choose not to.A smart guy who's gay and squanders his future to be a &#34;roommate&#34; with a homo-phobic.  A girl who sees no worth in herself.  A guy (won't call him a man) with a child and wife who would rather stay drunk days on end with his other drunk buddies.  That's the movie.
