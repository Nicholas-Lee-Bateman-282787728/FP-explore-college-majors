1667494,A3D7MTM1H3ETLW,B00EJSMOPS,Steven,"[0, 0]","It is cool going back to 1972, and seeing the Dodge Challenger and other cool cars from that era.  I was 9 years old back in 1972, and was cool revisiting that era.  This show changed television forever.  It came at a time when there was a lot of racial unrest in the country and it showed that a black man (Lincoln Hayes) could be friends with a white man (Peter Cochrane) and a white woman (Julie Barnes) I think it had a great deal to change the way people look at the races.  Room 222 also aired during the same era, also changed the hearts and minds of many Americans.The Mod Squad and Room 222 dealt with real issues, and did not sugar coat life like the Brady Bunch and other shows from that era.That is why it is still as relevant today, as it was 40 years ago.",5,Great Series,1389398400,"01 11, 2014",2014,769,"['cool', 'going', 'back', '1972', 'seeing', 'Dodge', 'Challenger', 'other', 'cool', 'cars', 'era', 'was', '9', 'years', 'old', 'back', '1972', 'was', 'cool', 'revisiting', 'era', 'show', 'changed', 'television', 'forever', 'came', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'lot', 'racial', 'unrest', 'country', 'showed', 'black', 'man', 'Lincoln', 'Hayes', 'could', 'be', 'friends', 'white', 'man', 'Peter', 'Cochrane', 'white', 'woman', 'Julie', 'Barnes', 'think', 'had', 'great', 'deal', 'change', 'way', 'people', 'look', 'races', 'Room', '222', 'also', 'aired', 'same', 'era', 'also', 'changed', 'hearts', 'minds', 'many', 'Americans.The', 'Mod', 'Squad', 'Room', '222', 'dealt', 'real', 'issues', 'did', 'not', 'sugar', 'coat', 'life', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'other', 'shows', 'why', 'still', 'relevant', 'today', 'was', '40', 'years', 'ago']",The Mod Squad Season 4 Volume Two
