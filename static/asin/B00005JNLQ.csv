632136,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B00005JNLQ,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[5, 10]","Perhaps the script for this film got caught in a windstorm, and they never got the pages in order, because that is how this nearly two hours of aimless filmmaking feels; the dialogue is disjointed, and the fine cast just can't pull it together to make much sense of it.The film suffers from the same repetitive quality and air of pretentiousness that gets the best of Werner Hertzog's 2004 ""documentary"" about the Loch Ness Monster, ""Incident at Loch Ness"", which has a clever concept, but one that soon wears thin. ""The Life Aquatic"" is also a fake documentary, and the premise is that oceanographer Steve Zissou (Bill Murray) hunts for the mythical Jaguar Shark that ate his friend Esteban (Seymour Cassel). There are many similarities between these two films, so if you enjoyed the Hertzog film, you will like this, and vice versa.Along with Murray and Cassell, the film boasts a cast of many well known actors, including Owen Wilson who plays Murray's presumed son, Cate Blanchett as a reporter, Angelica Huston as Murray's wife, as well as Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Michael Gambon, and Bud Cort.The talent that shines the brightest is singer/guitarist Seu Jorge, whose material is excellent (including some David Bowie songs translated into Portuguese), and vocal style wonderful.Writer/director Wes Anderson missed some opportunities here; a more cohesive script and editing would have made this film a far more entertaining adventure, and also greater use of the marvelous stop motion animated effects of marine life, which are a delight, but are few and far between.

632138,A3Q2V5V8PGRYIB,B00005JNLQ,"Amazon Customer ""Dave Lake""","[0, 1]","The other reviews do a good job of laying out the story and at least one alluded to Moby Dick. This is what spoke to me: a man in decline on an impossible quest and realizing that his life devoted to fakery has become fake and finding acceptance in this. Even his family is fake but he MAKES them real, accepts a potential interloper as a son, and feels the loss at the end. In short the fake becomes real and the real becomes somewhat fake. Bill Murray annoys me as much or more than most of the reviewers here, but I think he was perfect for this role because he has the sense that emotions are all fake and then the sense of loss and emptiness that comes about as a result of that. Seeing the hokey looking ""Jaguar Shark"" was simultaneously hilarious and sad as the figures sat behind the submarine windows wondering which side of the window was fiction, them or the silly beast. And the joke seems to be on us viewers, with this sort of question. Of course I may be reading too much into this little gem. There are some great campy send ups of other movies, of the egoism of the Jacques Cousteau types and adventurers, of the father issues most sensitive men have in the western world, of shootout scenes where nobody important ever seems hurt in the hail of bullets. These scenes are humorous, but the Bill Murray character lends them a sadness because he actually seems to be the embodiment of that dilemma of humans having become more produced than producers.",4,"Thoughtfully funny parody of Fake as Real, Commercialized Science, Life as Camp",1358640000,"01 20, 2013",2013,1466,"['other', 'reviews', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'laying', 'out', 'story', 'least', 'one', 'alluded', 'Moby', 'Dick', 'what', 'spoke', 'man', 'decline', 'impossible', 'quest', 'realizing', 'life', 'devoted', 'fakery', 'become', 'fake', 'finding', 'acceptance', 'Even', 'family', 'fake', 'MAKES', 'real', 'potential', 'interloper', 'son', 'loss', 'end', 'short', 'fake', 'becomes', 'real', 'real', 'becomes', 'somewhat', 'fake', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'much', 'more', 'most', 'reviewers', 'here', 'think', 'was', 'perfect', 'role', 'sense', 'emotions', 'are', 'fake', 'then', 'sense', 'loss', 'emptiness', 'about', 'result', 'Seeing', 'hokey', 'looking', 'Jaguar', 'Shark', 'was', 'simultaneously', 'hilarious', 'sad', 'figures', 'sat', 'submarine', 'wondering', 'side', 'window', 'was', 'fiction', 'silly', 'beast', 'joke', 'be', 'viewers', 'sort', 'question', 'course', 'may', 'be', 'reading', 'too', 'much', 'little', 'gem', 'are', 'great', 'campy', 'send', 'ups', 'other', 'movies', 'egoism', 'Jacques', 'Cousteau', 'types', 'adventurers', 'father', 'issues', 'most', 'sensitive', 'men', 'have', 'western', 'world', 'shootout', 'scenes', 'where', 'nobody', 'important', 'ever', 'hurt', 'hail', 'bullets', 'scenes', 'are', 'humorous', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'character', 'sadness', 'actually', 'be', 'embodiment', 'dilemma', 'humans', 'having', 'become', 'more', 'produced', 'producers']",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

Wes Anderson has a very distinct flair for storytelling (verbally and visually) that really shine in this movie, far more (IMHO) than his previous films.  He does a great job of portraying the resolutely downtrodden - Bill Murray is a bordeline washed up naturalist/film maker, and his despair coupled with immense self contempt coupled with a seething disdain for the human race is brilliantly portrayed.  I especially enjoy the camera work, another characteristic of Anderson.  He's great at the wide angle shots, often including many actors in a single frame.

632142,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JNLQ,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","Continuing my discussion of Wes Anderson's work, I've come to `The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou'.  This film may be his most controversial to date, and I mean that because pretty much everyone I talk to either considers this his finest or his worst film.  I think that, conceptually, this is his best work.  That said, I have some issues with the films construction and overall presence and, while I don't think it's as bad as `Rushmore', I do consider it a lesser work, especially when compared to `The Royal Tenenbaums' or `Fantastic Mr. Fox'.The film covers the adventures Steve Zissou, a marine filmmaker, as he ventures out to capture (and kill) the shark that ate his best friend.  Zissou's mission is thrown into disarray by the sudden emergence of Ned Plimpton (or Kingsley Zissou) who may or may not be Steve's son.  Add to that the appearance of a pregnant journalist named Jane, the jealousness of Steve's right hand man Klaus, the defiant stance of Steve's wife Eleanor and the arrogance of Steve's nemesis Alistair (not to mention a pirate attack) and you have the makings for a very awkward yet comically fulfilling adventure.Sort of.Anderson has a richly unique brand of humor that, at times, is a stroke of genius.  There is something about the way he layers his deadpan approach that can be awfully rewarding.  Here, sadly, he doesn't always nail his attempts.  While, for me, the film is rich with meaning and sentiment (I'll get to that in a minute), the film is not nearly as funny as it should have been.  Moments really land well (the chaotic pirate attack) but other parts (the entire first half almost) just seem to lay there stagnant, baiting you to find something humorous here.It just doesn't work.Like I mentioned, the concept is wonderful.  The idea that youth never dies in the heart of a boy is beautifully woven here.  You can see all the wonderful things that make being a child so enjoyable, and the fact that this is referenced a lot here (""that was my favorite age"") makes this statement so boisterous.  In the end, this is very much a `Peter Pan' type story, a story about a man who doesn't want to grow up.The acting is pretty good here.  Sadly, the script doesn't allow for a lot of character development.  The only character that gets some good `fleshing' here is Steve, and to a degree Jane.  Maybe that is why Bill Murray and Cate Blanchett are the best in show here.  The rest of the cast does a fine job, but they really don't standout much (aside from a remarkably funny Jeff Goldblum) due to shallow character development.Visually, the film is enticing.  The use of stop-motion and vibrant animation here was inspired and helped pave the way for Anderson to present us with his masterpiece, `Fantastic Mr. Fox'.  Like I said, in parts this film is very good, and I don't hate it at all.  I just know that it could have been better.  It could have been a lot better.I'd give it a B-.",4,Life is an adventure...,1271635200,"04 19, 2010",2010,2930,"['Continuing', 'discussion', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'work', ""'ve"", 'come', 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'Steve', 'Zissou', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'controversial', 'date', 'mean', 'pretty', 'much', 'everyone', 'talk', 'considers', 'finest', 'worst', 'film', 'think', 'conceptually', 'best', 'work', 'said', 'have', 'issues', 'films', 'construction', 'overall', 'presence', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'as', 'bad', 'Rushmore', 'do', 'consider', 'lesser', 'work', 'especially', 'when', 'compared', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'Fantastic', 'Mr.', ""Fox'.The"", 'film', 'adventures', 'Steve', 'Zissou', 'marine', 'filmmaker', 'ventures', 'out', 'capture', 'kill', 'shark', 'ate', 'best', 'friend', 'Zissou', 'mission', 'thrown', 'disarray', 'sudden', 'emergence', 'Ned', 'Plimpton', 'Kingsley', 'Zissou', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'Steve', 'son', 'Add', 'appearance', 'pregnant', 'journalist', 'named', 'Jane', 'jealousness', 'Steve', 'right', 'hand', 'man', 'Klaus', 'defiant', 'stance', 'Steve', 'wife', 'Eleanor', 'arrogance', 'Steve', 'nemesis', 'Alistair', 'not', 'mention', 'pirate', 'attack', 'have', 'makings', 'very', 'awkward', 'yet', 'comically', 'fulfilling', 'adventure.Sort', 'of.Anderson', 'richly', 'unique', 'brand', 'humor', 'times', 'stroke', 'genius', 'something', 'way', 'deadpan', 'approach', 'can', 'be', 'awfully', 'rewarding', 'Here', 'sadly', ""n't"", 'always', 'nail', 'attempts', 'film', 'rich', 'meaning', 'sentiment', ""'ll"", 'get', 'minute', 'film', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'funny', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Moments', 'really', 'land', 'well', 'chaotic', 'pirate', 'attack', 'other', 'parts', 'entire', 'first', 'half', 'almost', 'just', 'seem', 'lay', 'stagnant', 'baiting', 'find', 'something', 'humorous', 'here.It', 'just', ""n't"", 'work.Like', 'mentioned', 'concept', 'wonderful', 'idea', 'youth', 'never', 'heart', 'boy', 'beautifully', 'woven', 'here', 'can', 'see', 'wonderful', 'things', 'make', 'being', 'child', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'fact', 'referenced', 'lot', 'here', 'was', 'favorite', 'age', 'statement', 'so', 'boisterous', 'end', 'very', 'much', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'type', 'story', 'story', 'man', 'who', ""n't"", 'want', 'grow', 'up.The', 'acting', 'pretty', 'good', 'here', 'Sadly', 'script', ""n't"", 'allow', 'lot', 'character', 'development', 'only', 'character', 'good', 'fleshing', 'here', 'Steve', 'degree', 'Jane', 'Maybe', 'why', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'are', 'best', 'show', 'here', 'rest', 'cast', 'fine', 'job', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'standout', 'much', 'aside', 'remarkably', 'funny', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'due', 'shallow', 'character', 'development.Visually', 'film', 'enticing', 'use', 'stop-motion', 'vibrant', 'animation', 'here', 'was', 'inspired', 'helped', 'pave', 'way', 'Anderson', 'present', 'masterpiece', 'Fantastic', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'said', 'parts', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'hate', 'just', 'know', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better.I', ""'d"", 'give', 'B-']",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

As in all of his films, many forgotten cultural icons are put on display such as the red caps and speedos of Cousteau along with a ship named ""The Belafonte.""  With actors, he always goes back to the deepest well, so to speak, and Bill Murray once again excels in a title role.  Murray has proved repeatedly that he has range far beyond that of a comedic actor. Here, he is a pleasure to have on screen.The diver Steve Zissou is a beaten, drunken, washed-up Cousteau clone coming out for one shadily financed final adventure--ostensibly to revenge the death of his old first mate, Esteban, at the hands of a Jaguar shark.  His possible son, Ned or Kingsley (Owen Wilson), then arrives and this becomes a far more interesting subplot than the chase for the shark; except for the fact that Wilson's Kentucky accent is just terrible.  The same can be said of the pirate sequences which are a lot of fun as Zissou takes on an Eastwood role.  Actually, you would not expect such things to occur nowadays and the attack on the pirate hideaway may have been my favorite scene.There are a good many notable co-stars standing out in The Life Aquatic.  Particularly fine is the performance by Willem Dafoe as Zissou's lackey and, sometime only supporter, Klaus.  Goldblum is great too as the foil and competitor diver.We are given unending twists in the plot, and, although it starts slowly, the story satifies by the end.  Yet plot never has had much to do with Wes Anderson's success.  His talent and gifts all lie in characterization.  How he achieves such development in a small timeframe is amazing.  In nearly every film we care about the individuals on screen as all of them have some aspect we find interesting, even if it's only in the Portuguese singing of cover songs.  We identify with them and feel resignation when our time with them ends.  This effort is no different from his earlier ones in this regard.  Although, not The Royal Tenenbaums, it's as good as Rushmore and Bottle Rocket, and certainly as strong as anything anybody else is putting out today.",5,"Wes Anderson, Genius.",1118448000,"06 11, 2005",2005,2178,"['impressive', 'achievement', 'here', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'who', 'be', 'one', 'top', 'three', 'directors', 'working', 'today', 'films', 'many', 'forgotten', 'cultural', 'icons', 'are', 'put', 'display', 'such', 'red', 'caps', 'speedos', 'Cousteau', 'ship', 'named', 'Belafonte', 'actors', 'always', 'back', 'deepest', 'well', 'so', 'speak', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'once', 'again', 'excels', 'title', 'role', 'Murray', 'proved', 'repeatedly', 'range', 'far', 'comedic', 'actor', 'Here', 'pleasure', 'have', 'screen.The', 'diver', 'Steve', 'Zissou', 'beaten', 'drunken', 'washed-up', 'Cousteau', 'clone', 'coming', 'out', 'one', 'shadily', 'financed', 'final', 'adventure', 'ostensibly', 'revenge', 'death', 'old', 'first', 'mate', 'Esteban', 'hands', 'Jaguar', 'shark', 'possible', 'son', 'Ned', 'Kingsley', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'then', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'subplot', 'chase', 'shark', 'fact', 'Wilson', 'Kentucky', 'accent', 'just', 'terrible', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'pirate', 'sequences', 'are', 'lot', 'fun', 'Zissou', 'Eastwood', 'role', 'Actually', 'would', 'not', 'expect', 'such', 'things', 'occur', 'nowadays', 'attack', 'pirate', 'hideaway', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'favorite', 'are', 'good', 'many', 'notable', 'co-stars', 'standing', 'out', 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'Particularly', 'fine', 'performance', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Zissou', 'lackey', 'sometime', 'only', 'supporter', 'Klaus', 'Goldblum', 'great', 'too', 'foil', 'competitor', 'diver.We', 'are', 'given', 'unending', 'twists', 'plot', 'slowly', 'story', 'satifies', 'end', 'plot', 'never', 'had', 'much', 'do', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'success', 'talent', 'gifts', 'lie', 'characterization', 'How', 'such', 'development', 'small', 'timeframe', 'amazing', 'nearly', 'film', 'care', 'individuals', 'screen', 'have', 'aspect', 'find', 'interesting', 'even', 'only', 'Portuguese', 'singing', 'cover', 'songs', 'identify', 'feel', 'resignation', 'when', 'time', 'effort', 'different', 'earlier', 'ones', 'regard', 'not', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'as', 'good', 'Rushmore', 'Bottle', 'Rocket', 'certainly', 'as', 'strong', 'anything', 'anybody', 'else', 'putting', 'out', 'today']",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
632147,A20IIR0422G3A5,B00005JNLQ,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[2, 5]","`The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou' co-written and directed by Wes Anderson is Anderson's third film starring Bill Murray. It's a genre parody somewhere between the slapstick style of Mel Brooks in `Blazing Saddles' and `Young Frankenstein' and the much more humanly telling style of Woody Allen in `Shadows and Fog' and `Zelig'. And yet, Anderson seems to have carved himself a wholly new approach to parody, as no one would confuse this film with the works of Brooks or Allen.I have been a major Bill Murray fan since I saw him in `Meatballs', after his movie debut in `Caddy Shack' and his major starring roles in `Stripes' and `Ghostbusters'. And, I think Murray makes this picture work, but I suspect that even his star power is not quite enough to lift this movie into the same league as either Anderson's previous picture, `The Royal Tenanbaums' or Murray's best recent role in `Lost in Translation'. The first thing I feel about the movie is that it wastes the talents of Anjelica Huston, Willem Dafoe, and Jeff Goldblum. I have seen Huston in a small part in Woody's `Crimes and Misdemeanors', and I did not feel her talent was wasted, as Allen made such good use of her time on the screen. As the second lead, Owen Wilson does well, especially with his atypical role and his great Kentucky accent. And it is such a pleasure to see Cate Blanchett in a very human role, after her stint as the elven queen, Galadrial in `Lord of the Rings'. Expert character actors Michael Gambon and Bud Cort also seem to occupy weakly conceived roles.One thing I believe about this movie is that it has lots of very funny moments, mostly, but not exclusively from Murray's lines and business. It's parody of French oceanographic icon, Jacques Cousteau is simply brilliant, and the basis of much of the best comic lines. I think the main problem is that it neither starts nor ends on a firm footing. It almost seems as if the film combines two or three totally unrelated stories, and none of the three are cleanly introduced or resolved.The most important story line is the death of Steve Zissou's partner in the jaws of a rare large Jaguar shark. We are never really introduced to this character and his relation with Zissou is never established before his demise. The second story line lies with the appearance of a supposed Zissou son (Owen Wilson). While there is much speculation on whether Zissou knew of his son before the son's appearance, this line of dialogue is never resolved. It is even complicated to the point of total obscurity by Zissou's wife (Houston) confiding with journalist Blanchett that Zissou shoots blanks and can therefore not be the father to anyone.The third story line is the very thin financial basis of Zissou's oceanographic / documentary enterprise, leading to the arrival of insurance bonding representative Cort, who we never even see in closeup. This plot line includes an incredibly improbable hijacking of Zissou's ship by a gang of Filipino pirates, repelled from the vessel by Zissou singlehandedly, using nothing more than an incredibly improbable number of shots from what is probably a nine (9) shot Glock handgun, in the face of the dozen pirates' submachine guns.This DVD includes one of my very favorite features, a voiceover commentary by the director and his co-writer, but even this feature doesn't totally save the movie for me, as the commentators simply don't follow the events on the screen. The commentary does introduce a bit of inadvertant humor in that it becomes more and more evident that it was recorded in the middle of a busy restaurant, with every imaginable ambient restaurant noise showing up in the commentary sound track.In spite of these problems, this movie is worth seeing for some of the great comic business and some of the inventiveness of the Cousteau / oceanographic parodies. The parodies of some nominally real sea life may alone be worth the price of admission. I suspect that if Mel Brooks or Woody Allen had done the same story, it may not have had as many laugh out loud funny gags, but it would have had a cleaner plot resolution, especially since Anderson's way with actors is a lot fresher than Brooks or Allen.A pleasure for Bill Murray fans, but no `Ghostbusters'!",4,Brilliant Murray Business and Dialogue.

While not a great movie, its worth a one time watch.Steve Zissou (Bill Murray) is a documentary film maker (he makes ocean/aquatic related films), who seems to be losing his edge with the public. When his assistant Esteban is murdered by an unknown sea creature that Steve labels ""The Jaguar Shark"" while shooting a documentary, he decides to exact his revenge by filming a ""Part 2"" in which he seeks out to find the creature.Along for the ride are his team of loyal companions, including newcomers Jane (Cate Blanchett), who is writing an article on Steve; and Ned (Owen Wilson), who has mysteriously appeared as Steve's long lost son (although neither are sure if Steve is actually the father)The movie consists of some pretty funny gags while on Steve's boat, and is quite colorfully filmed. The digital animation of the sea creatures is also a nice humorous touch. Basically the movie follows the relationships of Steve and his crew, along with the developing relationship Steve is having with Ned and Jane.Steve is played very low-key by Murray, and the performance pays off. Blanchett is fantastic as always, an Owen Wilson does some fine work as the subtly quiet Kentucky raised Ned.The script in ""The Life Aquatic"" isn't that strong, and the real presence of the film is easily formed by its established actors and colorful direction.

Bill Murray really cannot act and could not carry the role of captain of the ship and its ecletic crew. Angelica Huston's character was too 2-D and unemotional. Maybe it was too much in media res. There was just too much to grasp. I thought that the Indian actor who plays Murray's butler in The Royal Tannenbaums would have been a better captain of this crazy hodge-podge crew.On the other hand, I liked how Anderson was trying to show how this group of unremarkable, regular folks, completely unqualified to undertake the expeditions of the ship, go out and seek adventure in the wide unknown, meanwhile a group of unpaid interns tag along to gain credit for partaking in such crazy disorganized, unscientific expeditions.

Most of his films fascinate me beyond my imagination, and even to the point of pondering, &#34;How did this man do it.&#34; I think I'm a person who will never understand what it's like to hate a Wes Anderson film. I absolutely adore his films by way of narrative style, cinematography, colors, and vivd characters and environments. One particular thing about his films that I think no one else can capture is the human emotion that occurs within in these quirky environments. Whenever viewing his films, I always capture a sense of emotion that connects to my life, and for many others as well. By Wes creating his films through his vision, he continues to inspire me to become a filmmaker myself.The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou is by far one of the most underrated comedy masterpieces of our time. The film is a tribute to the great oceanographer Jacque Yves Cousteau. Anderson usually incorporates underwater scenes within most of his films, (Bottle Rocket, Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, Fantastic Mr. Fox, Moonrise Kingdom) so it was quite necessary for his interest to be placed within this story. I really do not wish to reveal much about this film, but... Wow! Never have I seen a movie so damn funny, so damn creative, and so well acted. Everything with this film hit high points for me, and to be honest, critics... What were you thinking? Just because a film is dead pan mixed in with surreal environments doesn't make it boring, it creates a world of it's own.Theory: Maybe people should actually think about what their watching, instead of always expecting predictable plots(Sorry, this is my opinion, not everyone's entitled to it.)The story is greatly planned out, the script is absolute genius, and Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, and Willem Dafoe SHINE.By far in my top favorite films list!

In fact, there were no big or small laughs throughout this flick. I didn't laugh out loud once--yet I was enthralled--laughing to myself, like Billy Idol, only laughing, not dancing, to myself.This film is somewhat like an inside joke that is so inside that even your laughter is inside.Steve Zissou: We were pretty good while we lasted, weren't we?Oseary Drakoulias: Oh, we were like glory's gate, my darling. We were like that bloody shark of yours, we swam with the... oh, damn it, I had it on the plane.Bill Murray as Steve Zissou really owned this movie. He was the flawed leader who can (usually) inspire his crew to follow them on the journey, the adventure, he was taking them on. He may not really know anything, he may be totally full of it--but still, he leads on. It is an adventure. Murray could convey so much with even his smallest throw away gesture.Owen Wilson's character Ned Plimpton was a good and pure man of integrity--very different from his usual role. He also had what was supposed to be a Kentucky accent, but he's no Meryl Streep, nor is he a Will Patton, on whom the accent was based. He tried something different, and for that he is to be commended--but he was somewhat the fish out of water, in comparison to Murray, who was made to play Steve Zissou, or vice versa. Steve Zissou was written with Bill Murray in mind and according to Wes Anderson, it ""could have been no one else."" Anjelica Huston, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Cate Blanchett, Bud Cort, even Matthew Gray Gubler--all added a lot.The film is a parody of the Undersea World of Jaques Cousteau, not just the oceanic exploration documentaries, but the whole preposterous idea of the Life Aquatic, the idea of doing scientific research while also making a film of it, and using the film to gain funding. While Jauques Cousteau's ship is called Calypso, Zissou's is called Belafonte, because Harry Belafonte was a calypso singer. Get it? This project seems to be from the point-of-view of a child watching Jaques Cousteau and dreaming of living the Life Aquatic, then a little more grown up, realizing what a strange life that would be. That concept is certainly realized in this movie, and I would recommend that you see this movie just because it is so different. But don't blame me if you expected the Big Laugh and got instead only the Smart Laugh, because I warned you about that.Steve Zissou: Supposedly Cousteau and his cronies invented the idea of putting walkie-talkies into the helmet. But we made ours with a special rabbit ear on the top so we could pipe in some music.And what music it was. Seu Jorge portrayed Pel&eacute; dos Santos, a crew member who also strummed bossa nova guitar and sang David Bowie songs translated into Portuegese. He seemed to be playing David Bowie songs at every opportunity. Only they were played with a Brazilian back beat--in Portugese. All the David Bowie songs are arranged and sang by Seu Jorge. Except, like, ""Search and Destroy,"" by Iggy Pop, but even that was produced by David Bowie.There were some really unusual shots interspersed throughout, and some animation that melded seamlessly with the live action footage. Candy flavored seahorses, blowfish, you name it, any kind of fish one could imagine, and Bill Murray flicks one of those wondrous creations off, like it were a bug, and maybe it is. Maybe it is.Steller cast. Wonderful director, writer, and cinematographer. Amazing art. There is one set where you see the ship in cut away view. Is that all there is? Is that all there is? If that's all there is, then let's keep dancing. Bring on the booze and have a ball, if that's all... there is.#$#$#$#$#$#Margot at the Wedding (2007) ....

632169,A1IPDLY9EHK9NI,B00005JNLQ,Chris,"[5, 7]","I am an Anderson fan, but with all his movies I usually have to watch them a second time before I fully appreciate them.  He shoves so much stuff (character wise, dialogue wise, visually and so on) that you miss so much on the first viewing.  Tenenbaums is the only that worked for me the first time around fully, but amazingly the next few times I watched it I still got more out of it.  I am figuring the same will happen with Life Aquatic.Murray plays as oceanographer Steve Zissou, a Cousteau-like filmmaker who goes in search of the jaguar shark who killed his friend, taking along a crew of eccentrics, including his ""maybe-son"" Ned (Owen Wilson).  In all honesty the jaguar shark isn't important, it's really just an excuse for Zissou to get through a mid-life crisis he is currently experiencing, triggered by the fact many people think he is now a hack filmmaker.  He hopes finding and killing the shark (sticking dynamite up an uncomfortable place is the plan) and catching it on film, as well as a possible father/son subplot, will return him to his former glory.Those expecting a ""wacky adventure"" about the search of the shark may be disappointed.  That's not to say wacky and odd things don't happen (they definitely do, ranging from budget problems to pirates) but the film is more character driven than plot driven (as I said before the shark isn't important, just a driving device, a sort of ""McGuffin"") and that may throw off some.Upon first seeing it I was a tad disappointed, but thinking about it I'm gaining more of an appreciation for it (I can't wait to watch it again on Criterion DVD).  I think I was a tad disappointed that the sub characters weren't really developed but that is beside the point really as I think about it.  It's about Zissou and that's it, it's his story and the change that occurs is what the movie is really about.  People who watch it as a revenge movie will definitely be disappointed by the end, but as long as you realize it's a story about Steve (not the shark) the ending is quite effective, and sort of sad.The movie is quite funny, but not as funny as Tenenbaums (maybe a second viewing will help there because Tenenbaums definitely got funnier with each viewing).  The humour is pretty dry and subtle.  Some of it revolves around the fact Steve really doesn't know much about the subject he's covering, the cheapness of his productions, odd sub characters (Dafoe is a riot as the ""calm, collected, German"" right hand man, Klaus) and his movies in general (the few we see are funny just because of how obviously staged they are, and I laughed my ass off at the one where they apparently found a thought to be extinct species because it was so phony).  There are a lot of throw away jokes as well, some great movie-making gags, and the scenes involving the pirates boarding, a raid on an island and another in Goldblum's lab were some of the funniest things I saw last year.  While the film did get incredibly silly at times, I at least had a smile on my face.Anderson does direct it almost in a documentary style (though with his usual anal framing of having everything centered and in shot), some of the action scenes come off haphazard but it just conveys that documentary feel.  Some people have speculated that you are actually watching Zissou's finished film, making this movie a ""movie-within-a-movie"".  And while there are some things that would suggest that (including a surprise during the end credits, and the fact the gunshots sound like pop guns, and the alread mentioned odd but funny action sequences) I somehow doubt Anderson would go that route, as the movie would lose some of the effectiveness of the character arc that occurs.The sea creatures are cool, stop-motion animated by Henry Selik, who did The Nightmare Before Christmas.  It adds a fantasy element that all Anderson films haveI had some problems that may change on repeat viewings.  I found the second half hour felt very off in terms of pacing.  The first half hour is funny and goes by fast, but then the second half hour almost stops.  His movies are never quick but they do move at a good pace and they work for me.  Thankfully at the midway point (or around there) it picks up again.  As well, as I also mentioned, I was disappointed it wasn't as funny as I would have hoped, but it might get funnier on repeat viewings now that I know the characters more (the same happened with Anderson's other films for me).  I laughed quite a bit, some sequences rather hard, but after Tenenbaums I may have been expecting more.  Sometimes it just comes off more silly than truly funny.I do have to watch it again, though.  Thinking about it I like it a lot more than I originally did, but it's a film I'm sure that requires a few viewings (even cast members such as Huston and Murray had to watch it a few times before it fully made sense, Murray said this on Letterman, to which the audience laughed, but he wasn't kidding.)  So much is going on that I know I missed some things.  Anderson's attention to detail is incredible and it makes repeat viewings worthwhile.I know many will hate it on first viewing because I know many like things handed to them and that they don't have to think about it afterwards (and chances are to get the full effect you will have to watch it again).  I know people have trouble with character driven films, and films that do require concentration and your attention, but if you make the effort you'll definitely get something out of it.  This movie doesn't hand anything to you (even the jokes require your attention) and it does require your participation.  It is an odd and quirky film, just a little off of reality, but it does have a heart.My opinion might change on it after I get the DVD and watch it and the supplements (I'll either like it more, or dislike it more) but as of now I think it was an unfairly overlooked film that people weren't expecting.  It might find a good audience, though.  Despite the fact I know people hated it, it's the first Anderson movie I saw in the theater where the majority of people were laughing, and my wife (who doesn't like Anderson's other films) actually liked it as well.  Maybe it will find its audience on DVD.",4,May have to watch it a few times...,1109376000,"02 26, 2005",2005,6223,"['am', 'Anderson', 'fan', 'movies', 'usually', 'have', 'watch', 'second', 'time',

That being said, the movie itself was somewhat flat and devoid of humour at times...almost bordering on sleep-inducing in my opinion.

632171,A1OB5L3WMHJAD9,B00005JNLQ,Christopher Culver,"[0, 1]","Wes Anderson's 2004 film THE LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU centers on the personal dramas of the title character (Bill Murray), a Cousteau-like oceanographer who feels like he has reached the end of his career. After a jaguar shark kills his partner, Zissou vows to go on one last adventure to hunt it and kill it. As he looks back on his womanizing private life, a young airline pilot (Owen Wilson) approaches him and suggests that Zissou may be his father. This budding father-son relationship unfolds among the struggles of Zissou's crew to reach the last known whereabouts of the shark.Those who know Wilson's earlier films, especially THE ROYAL TENNENBAUMS of 2000, will recognize many similar themes, actors and humour here. The setting is ostensibly in our own time, but with much retro design. There are complex personal relationships and failed marriages. And the soundtrack is quirky, this time to an even greater degree (Brazilian star Seu Jorge singing David Bowie translated into Portugese and playing the guitar). However, there are some fresh new elements that keep this from being a mere repetition of his earlier comedy/dramas. There's even two shootout scenes, so Anderson certainly can't be hit with charges of making films where people just talk and talk. A delightful visual touch are the fanciful sea creatures (stop-motion puppets, not CGI), and the set design, which makes Zissou's ship Belefonte look real. Finally, whatever else one might thing of the film, the cinematography of the helicopter crash scene deserves great praise for so subtly and gradually informing the viewer that something has gone horribly wrong.Yet, for its general entertainment on a single viewing, THE LIFE AQUATIC strikes me as Anderson's most uncomfortable film to date. Of everyone here, only Steve Zissou is presented with any sort of depth. Owen Wilson's character is about as vague and featureless as the jaguar shark himself, just one more obstacle thrown in Zissou's path. Bill Murray had already honed this type of grim middle-aged moper many times before, reaching his finest hour with LOST IN TRANSLATION, but here (as well as in BROKEN FLOWERS) he's obviously gotten stuck in a rut as an actor. Klaus, the German first mate, is a lame ethnic cariacture.",3,"Entertaining on one viewing, but perhaps Anderson's most discomforting film yet",1217808000,"08 4, 2008",2008,2267,"['Wes', 'Anderson', '2004', 'film', 'THE', 'LIFE', 'AQUATIC', 'WITH', 'STEVE', 'ZISSOU', 'centers', 'personal', 'dramas', 'title', 'character', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Cousteau-like', 'oceanographer', 'who', 'reached', 'end', 'career', 'jaguar', 'shark', 'partner', 'Zissou', 'go', 'one', 'last', 'adventure', 'hunt', 'kill', 'back', 'womanizing', 'private', 'life', 'young', 'airline', 'pilot', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Zissou', 'may', 'be', 'father', 'budding', 'father-son', 'relationship', 'unfolds', 'struggles', 'Zissou', 'crew', 'reach', 'last', 'known', 'whereabouts', 'shark.Those', 'who', 'know', 'Wilson', 'earlier', 'films', 'especially', 'THE', 'ROYAL', 'TENNENBAUMS', '2000', 'will', 'recognize', 'many', 'similar', 'themes', 'actors', 'humour', 'here', 'setting', 'ostensibly', 'own', 'time', 'much', 'retro', 'design', 'are', 'complex', 'personal', 'relationships', 'failed', 'marriages', 'soundtrack', 'quirky', 'time', 'even', 'greater', 'degree', 'Brazilian', 'star', 'Seu', 'Jorge', 'singing', 'David', 'Bowie', 'translated', 'Portugese', 'playing', 'guitar', 'However', 'are', 'fresh', 'new', 'elements', 'keep', 'being', 'mere', 'repetition', 'earlier', 'comedy/dramas', 'even', 'two', 'shootout', 'scenes', 'Anderson', 'certainly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'hit', 'charges', 'making', 'films', 'where', 'people', 'just', 'talk', 'talk', 'delightful', 'visual', 'touch', 'are', 'fanciful', 'sea', 'creatures', 'stop-motion', 'puppets', 'not', 'CGI', 'set', 'design', 'Zissou', 'ship', 'Belefonte', 'look', 'real', 'Finally', 'else', 'one', 'might', 'thing', 'film', 'cinematography', 'helicopter', 'crash', 'scene', 'great', 'praise', 'so', 'subtly', 'gradually', 'informing', 'viewer', 'something', 'gone', 'horribly', 'wrong.Yet', 'general', 'entertainment', 'single', 'viewing', 'THE', 'LIFE', 'AQUATIC', 'strikes', 'Anderson', 'most', 'uncomfortable', 'film', 'date', 'everyone', 'here', 'only', 'Steve', 'Zissou', 'presented', 'sort', 'depth', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'character', 'vague', 'featureless', 'jaguar', 'shark', 'just', 'one', 'more', 'obstacle', 'thrown', 'Zissou', 'path', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'had', 'already', 'honed', 'type', 'grim', 'middle-aged', 'moper', 'many', 'times', 'reaching', 'finest', 'hour', 'LOST', 'IN', 'TRANSLATION', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'BROKEN', 'FLOWERS', 'obviously', 'gotten', 'stuck', 'rut', 'actor', 'Klaus', 'German', 'first', 'mate', 'lame', 'ethnic', 'cariacture']",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

It's a odd film: one of these low-key black humor films which is a mixture of drama and comedy. What set this apart were a few other shocking scenes of violence, something not normally in this type of movie. For a comedy, albeit a tongue-in-cheek one, that violence doesn't seem to fit, but it makes the film all the more intriguing.At times I was totally bored with this movie and at other times fascinated. I know one thing: this is a bizarre story! That automatically means it's a good vehicle for Bill Murray, who excels at wacky characters, even the low-key ones as he sometimes plays (i.e. Lost In Translation, The Royal Tenebaums, etc.). Speaking of the latter, this movie was written and directed by Wes Anderson, the same man who did ""Tenenbaums."" If you saw that, you have an idea of what you might get here, although I thought Royal Tenenbaums was funnier.At 118 minutes, this a bit long for what it offers. I'd like to have seen it 15 minutes shorter with a tighter script. But it does offer some good photography in addition to the strange story. For the colors, I'd like to see this on Blu-Ray.

632179,AUHG8KSHI529U,B00005JNLQ,Craig Matteson,"[178, 198]","I think if everyone would stop referring to the Wes Anderson movies as comedies we would all be better off.  ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" is not about making the audience laugh.  Yes, there are times you will laugh, but there are also times you will cringe, and there are other moments for just about everything else.  What kind of movie is it?  It really isn't something that can be given a single label.  Yes, there are all kinds of jokes, but aren't they in the service of something more than simple laughs?  Hearing David Bowie songs in Portuguese with an acoustic guitar is not only funny, it is kind of beautiful.A simple joke is the name of Zissou's ship.  The Belefonte is clearly a play on Cousteau's Calypso as are the crew's red knit caps.  However, some of the humor is quite tough.  Think of the scene with Jeff Goldblum's Alistair Hennessy playing cards with his pirate captors as Steve Zissou comes in the room.  What follows is funny, but grim at the same time.  Then there is the weird way the inside of the boat is portrayed in a cutaway set that looks fake and is meant to look fake.  Notice that the science room is the smallest room on this research vessel.  The Sauna is much bigger and all the rooms given over to film production constitute most of the ship.This movie has a lot of fun with the artificial in documentaries and films.  Even the scenes of creatures of the sea are often CGI creations that don't even try to look real.  Heck, even the colors in the Zissou documentaries are supersaturated and look like they were done in different colors of ink rather than the ocean.  How real is life when you are more concerned about getting everything shot with the right sound rather than living it?  And how legitimate can a documentary be when it is cobbled together from a lot of staged shots and hosted by someone who really doesn't have a clue about the science behind what is being filmed?All of the lead actors are terrific and Bill Murray leads the way as the weary and fading Steve Zissou.  Everyone involved with Zissou has their own downward arc.  Even the equipment is old and barely works.  Tired helicopters are dangerous things.Does the movie work?  Maybe not.  However, I find so much to watch and enjoy in each scene - even just the actions of the non-speaking characters - that I really enjoyed this movie.  If you want to see something strangely beautiful, that plays with all kinds of notions of what is real and what is fake and has a lot of fun along the way, this might be something you would enjoy, although it is not for children.I guess the kind of send up it is, even of Moby Dick, can be captured by then end title that expresses ""gratitude to the Jacques Cousteau Society even though they had nothing to do with the making of the film.""

632183,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B00005JNLQ,Cubist,"[58, 63]","There's always a certain amount of trepidation when a filmmaker like Wes Anderson, known for making intimate and personal films, starts making movies on a more ambitious scale - bigger budgets and movie stars in an attempt to appeal to larger audience - that he will lose all of the qualities that made his movies so interesting in the first place. Easily his most accomplished film, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou merges his stylized dialogue and quirky characters with elaborate sets and action set pieces in an exotic locale.Anderson's career has been building up to this film. With The Royal Tenenbaums, Anderson was able to juggle a large cast of name stars while still maintaining his artistic integrity. With Life Aquatic, he continues to use stars but has upped the ante in production values and scope. However, he has not lost the intimate feeling that all of his movies possess. No matter how ambitious or big the scale, his films have hand-crafted feel to them. One gets the feeling that Anderson cares about every detail an every aspect and it is this personal touch that makes his movies so unique.On the first DVD there are nine deleted scenes that feature some nice little bits of business between characters. There is nothing too significant for the most part and these were rightly cut out.There is a theatrical trailer.Also included is an audio commentary by Wes Anderson and co-screenwriter Noah Baumbach recorded at the restaurant in New York City where they worked on the screenplay. This is an engaging and thoughtful track as the two men touch upon the film's themes in an unpretentious way.""Starz on the Set"" is a 14-minute featurette. It is fairly standard press kit material as Anderson and the cast talk about the movie's plot and their characters with lots of clips from the film.The second disc features a collection of stills taken during filming.""The Look Aquatic"" is a brief look at how the specific world that Anderson wanted to depict in his film was achieved, including the large set of the cross-section of the Zissou's ship, the Belafonte.In ""Creating a Scene,"" the cast talk about Anderson's style of filmmaking and how they contribute to it.There is an excellent interview with long-time Anderson composer, Mark Mothersbaugh. Mothersbaugh talks about his transition from Devo to scoring movies and TV shows (his first gig was Pee-Wee's Playhouse) and gives insight into his creative process.""Mondo Monda"" is an amusing parody of an Italian talk show hosted by Antonio Monda who interviews Anderson and Baumbach in Italian while the two men struggle to understand what he's saying.""Seu Jorge Performs David Bowie"" features footage of the Brazilian recording artist performing ten Bowie songs in their entirety in Portuguese on the set of the film. Some were used in the film.""Aquatic Life"" is a fascinating look at how the undersea creatures were made via stop-motion animation by Henry Selick and his team and then inserted into the movie via computer.The ""Esteban"" featurette follows Seymour Cassel around in Italy as he buys some cigars, talks about John Cassavetes and his movies and we see him being directed by Anderson on the underwater set of the movie.The centerpiece of the supplemental material is ""This is an Adventure,"" 51 minute documentary made by Albert Maysles, Antonio Ferrera and Matthew Prinzing during filming in 2003. We get to see various scenes being shot in this absorbing doc.""Intern Video Journal"" is a behind-the-scenes featurette shot and edited by ""Intern #1"" Matthew Gray Gubler. He also documents what the cast and crew do between takes - sleeping, playing foosball and basically messing around to alleviate the boredom.There is also a gallery of paintings of the characters, logos and poster that were featured in the movie.""Ned"" is a brief interview with Owen Wilson as he talks about his character.Also included is a look at the costumes designed for the movie.Finally, there is a brief look at Cate Blanchett's character with the actress talking about how she incorporated her real-life pregnancy in the role.",5,The 2-Disc Special Edition is the way to go!,1115683200,"05 10, 2005",2005,4087,"['always', 'certain', 'amount', 'trepidation', 'when', 'filmmaker', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'known', 'making', 'intimate', 'personal', 'films', 'making', 'movies', 'more', 'ambitious', 'scale', 'bigger', 'budgets', 'movie', 'stars', 'attempt', 'appeal', 'larger', 'audience', 'will', 'lose', 'qualities', 'made', 'movies', 'so', 'interesting', 'first', 'place', 'Easily', 'most', 'accomplished', 'film', 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'Steve', 'Zissou', 'stylized', 'dialogue', 'quirky', 'characters', 'elaborate', 'sets', 'action', 'set', 'pieces', 'exotic', 'locale.Anderson', 'career', 'been', 'building', 'up', 'film', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'Anderson', 'was', 'able', 'juggle', 'large', 'cast', 'name', 'stars', 'still', 'maintaining', 'artistic', 'integrity', 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'use', 'stars', 'upped', 'ante', 'production', 'values', 'scope', 'However', 'not', 'lost', 'intimate', 'feeling', 'movies', 'possess', 'matter', 'how', 'ambitious', 'big', 'scale', 'films', 'have', 'hand-crafted', 'feel', 'One', 'feeling', 'Anderson', 'detail', 'aspect', 'personal', 'touch', 'movies', 'so', 'first', 'DVD', 'are', 'nine', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'feature', 'nice', 'little', 'bits', 'business', 'characters', 'nothing', 'too', 'significant', 'most', 'part', 'were', 'rightly', 'cut', 'theatrical', 'trailer.Also', 'included', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'co-screenwriter', 'Noah', 'Baumbach', 'recorded', 'restaurant', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'where', 'worked', 'screenplay', 'engaging', 'thoughtful', 'track', 'two', 'men', 'touch', 'film', 'themes', 'unpretentious', 'way', 'Starz', 'Set', '14-minute', 'featurette', 'fairly', 'standard', 'press', 'kit', 'material', 'Anderson', 'cast', 'talk', 'movie', 'plot', 'characters', 'lots', 'clips', 'film.The', 'second', 'disc', 'collection', 'stills', 'taken', 'filming', 'Look', 'Aquatic', 'brief', 'look', 'how', 'specific', 'world', 'Anderson', 'wanted', 'depict', 'film', 'was', 'achieved', 'including', 'large', 'set', 'cross-section', 'Zissou', 'ship', 'Belafonte.In', 'Creating', 'Scene', 'cast', 'talk', 'Anderson', 'style', 'filmmaking', 'how', 'contribute', 'it.There', 'excellent', 'interview', 'long-time', 'Anderson', 'composer', 'Mark', 'Mothersbaugh', 'Mothersbaugh', 'talks', 'transition', 'Devo', 'scoring', 'movies', 'TV', 'shows', 'first', 'gig', 'was', 'Pee-Wee', 'Playhouse', 'insight', 'creative', 'process', 'Mondo', 'Monda', 'amusing', 'parody', 'Italian', 'talk', 'show', 'hosted', 'Antonio', 'Monda', 'who', 'interviews', 'Anderson', 'Baumbach', 'Italian', 'two', 'men', 'struggle', 'understand', 'what', 'saying', 'Seu', 'Jorge', 'Performs', 'David', 'Bowie', 'footage', 'Brazilian', 'recording', 'artist', 'performing', 'ten', 'Bowie', 'songs', 'entirety', 'Portuguese', 'set', 'film', 'were', 'used', 'film', 'Aquatic', 'Life', 'fascinating', 'look', 'how', 'undersea', 'creatures', 'were', 'made', 'stop-motion', 'animation', 'Henry', 'Selick', 'team', 'then', 'inserted', 'movie', 'computer.The', 'Esteban', 'featurette', 'Seymour', 'Cassel', 'Italy', 'cigars', 'talks', 'John', 'Cassavetes', 'movies', 'see', 'being', 'directed', 'Anderson', 'underwater', 'set', 'movie.The', 'centerpiece', 'supplemental', 'material', 'Adventure', '51', 'minute', 'documentary', 'made', 'Albert', 'Maysles', 'Antonio', 'Ferrera', 'Matthew', 'Prinzing', 'filming', '2003', 'get', 'see', 'various', 'scenes', 'being', 'shot', 'absorbing', 'doc', 'Intern', 'Video', 'Journal', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurette', 'shot', 'edited', 'Intern', '1', 'Matthew', 'Gray', 'Gubler', 'also', 'documents', 'what', 'cast', 'crew', 'do', 'sleeping', 'playing', 'foosball', 'basically', 'messing', 'alleviate', 'boredom.There', 'also', 'gallery', 'paintings', 'characters', 'logos', 'poster', 'were', 'featured', 'movie', 'Ned', 'brief', 'interview', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'character.Also', 'included', 'look', 'costumes', 'designed', 'movie.Finally', 'brief', 'look', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'character', 'actress', 'talking', 'how', 'incorporated', 'real-life', 'pregnancy', 'role']",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

I know this term is overused when describing his style but his quirky world-view is downright infectuous.  Given a larger budget in which to work with what does Anderson do?  He doesn't skip a beat.  This film is a piece with his pervious works, ""Bottle Rocket"", ""Rushmore"" and ""The Royal Tenenebaums"".  This film contains a highly imaginative visual style.  There are any number of throwaway gags, both verbal and visual that'll leave you in tears.  Bill Murray solidly anchors this film as Captain Zissou and is ably abetted by a strong supporting cast(Owen Wilson, Willem Dafoe, Angelica Huston, Jeff Goldblum, Cate Blanchett, etc.).  These are fully formed characters as opposed to caricatures and are not overwhelmed by Anderson's inspired tomfoolery.  I originally saw this film in the theatre and having seen it a second time I picked up on some gags that I missed the first time around.

Both of these characters are likable in how off-center they are.  Zissou is an aging oceanographer, with all the vices of a sailor.  Plimpton is a Southern gentleman and a pilot.  These two people set off along with a crew to film and destroy a giant shark.What gives this movie such a strange feel is the mixture of realism and absurdity.  Some scenes are hilarious in how ridiculous they are, while others show how brutal and fragile life can be on the ocean.  At times, it can leave the viewer a bit confused on what just happened.So thinking back on ""The Life Aquatic"", I can best describe it as a strange sentimental movie.

One of the reasons The Royal T's wasen't as great was becuase Bill Murray didn't have nearly enough screen time.Well, I finally got around to renting it and it blew me away!It was by far the funniest, weirdest, most clever film I sawthat year. Bill Murray is back in the leading man role for Wes and does awsome! It's funny that Bill made his career by taking on roles of loud, obnoxious, crazy characters and has lately become the king of dead pan comedy. Murray isn't just a funny guy anymore, he's also a really good actor! Joining Murray are Cate Blanchett, who reprises roles we've seen her in before, but holds her own nonetheless, Owen Wilson, always hilarious and Willem Dafoe, who steals the show this time around, I've never seen him funnier!Anderson spins a tale of a reuniting father and son, a love triangle, jelousy, revenge, hijacking, kidnapping, rescuing and of couse, sea life. How he was able to weave all these genre's into one movie and get away with it is a testament to what a talented director he is.As for the DVD, it was released by Criterion, so obviously it's going to have the best picture and sound quality money can buy.The movie was released in two versions, a single disc, with commentary and trailers, or a two disc special addition, which is what I'm reviewing. The prices of the two versions vary from store to store, but wherever you're buying from, the two disc addition is well worth the extra few bucks. I won't go into what's in the features because it's written above in the description, but I will say they are one of the best feature packages I've ever seen on DVD!Movie: 5 starsFeatures: 5 stars",5,King Dead Pan,1123545600,"08 9, 2005",2005,1775,"['first', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'Life', 'Aqautic', 'found', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'be', 'disappointment', 'Bottle', 'Rocket', 'Rushmore', 'One', 'reasons', 'Royal', 'T', 'wase', ""n't"", 'great', 'was', 'becuase', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'nearly', 'enough', 'screen', 'time.Well', 'finally', 'got', 'renting', 'blew', 'away', 'was', 'far', 'funniest', 'weirdest', 'most', 'clever', 'film', 'sawthat', 'year', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'back', 'leading', 'man', 'role', 'Wes', 'awsome', 'funny', 'Bill', 'made', 'career', 'taking', 'roles', 'loud', 'obnoxious', 'crazy', 'characters', 'lately', 'become', 'king', 'dead', 'pan', 'comedy', 'Murray', ""n't"", 'just', 'funny', 'guy', 'anymore', 'also', 'really', 'good', 'actor', 'Joining', 'Murray', 'are', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'who', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'before', 'own', 'nonetheless', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'always', 'hilarious', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'who', 'show', 'time', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'funnier', 'Anderson', 'tale', 'reuniting', 'father', 'son', 'love', 'triangle', 'jelousy', 'revenge', 'hijacking', 'kidnapping', 'rescuing', 'couse', 'sea', 'life', 'How', 'was', 'able', 'weave', 'genre', 'one', 'movie', 'get', 'away', 'testament', 'what', 'talented', 'director', 'DVD', 'was', 'released', 'Criterion', 'so', 'obviously', 'going', 'have', 'best', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'money', 'can', 'buy.The', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'two', 'versions', 'single', 'disc', 'commentary', 'trailers', 'two', 'disc', 'special', 'addition', 'what', ""'m"", 'reviewing', 'prices', 'two', 'versions', 'vary', 'store', 'store', ""'re"", 'buying', 'two', 'disc', 'addition', 'well', 'extra', 'few', 'bucks', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'what', 'features', 'written', 'description', 'will', 'say', 'are', 'one', 'best', 'feature', 'packages', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'DVD', 'Movie', '5', 'starsFeatures', '5', 'stars']",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
632198,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B00005JNLQ,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[3, 4]","Wes Anderson has had a sterling track record up until now: the hilarious ""Bottle Rocket,"" pensive ""Rushmore"" and darkly funny ""Royal Tenenbaums."" With ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou,"" he's not quite in top form. The movie is far from bad -- the cast is sterling, and Anderson's style is intact -- but it isn't quite as good as his past work.Steve Zissou (Billy Murray) is a Jacques Cousteau-like marine biologist and explorer, who seems to be baffled by his own species. After the premiere of his newest documentary, Zissou informs the crowd that he intends to get revenge on the legendary Jaguar Shark that devoured his friend. Why? Revenge. So he starts cobbling together a new expedition.Among the odd ducks who join the expedition are Ned (Owen Wilson) who believes Zissou is his father, a pregnant British journalist (Cate Blanchett) and an emotionally insecure German (Willem Dafoe). Ned and Zissou try to work out their odd relationship as their whimsical Moby Dick quest starts zoning in on the Jaguar Shark.""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" has an intriguing beginning and a glorious finale. The middle just lacks a bit of the necessary meat -- it needs a bit more than a whimsical Ahab quest to keep it moving. But Anderson makes up for storytelling gaps, by using his unique style and the quirky talents of his actors. I didn't know Dafoe -- also known as the Green Goblin -- was so darn funny.Actually, the whole idea of the movie is pretty intriguing -- Jacques Cousteau with Ahab's revenge thang. And Anderson takes his cinematic quirks and turns them on ""high."" Dancing fish, Porteguese covers of David Bowie, and pirate attacks take place, surrounded by colorful costumes and impossibly bright settings. The sea never looked so blue. And rarely has comedy been as dry and quirky.And Anderson also fills the gaps with his unique way of conveying... well, the best term is deadpan emotion. It kicks off with ""I'm going to go on an overnight drunk, and in 10 days I'm going to set out to find the shark that ate my friend and destroy it,"" and proceeds with a mixture of comedy and pathos, lurking just under the surface. Nobody bursts into tears or howls with rage -- Anderson prefers to just let the actors take over their characters. The only problem with this is that sometimes he tries to cover the overstretched plot parts with it.Bill Murray is at his best when he plays quirky, deadpan men, and he does an excellent job with Zissou. Zissou is, like Royal Tenenbaum, an aging child-man who is stubborn, insensitive, and very clueless. Somehow, possibly because of Murray's acting charm, he's likable. Wilson restrains his goofball comedy for a more poignant role, and the supporting cast -- especially the outstanding Dafoe and the wonderful Blanchett -- are also quite solid.""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" suffers from too little plot in some places. But don't forget, Wes Anderson at his worst moments still swims far above the average director -- and so does the movie.",4,Almost swimmingly,1109030400,"02 22, 2005",2005,3005,"['Wes', 'Anderson', 'had', 'sterling', 'track', 'record', 'now', 'hilarious', 'Bottle', 'Rocket', 'pensive', 'Rushmore', 'darkly', 'funny', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'Steve', 'Zissou', 'not', 'quite', 'top', 'form', 'movie', 'far', 'bad', 'cast', 'sterling', 'Anderson', 'style', 'intact', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'past', 'work.Steve', 'Zissou', 'Billy', 'Murray', 'Jacques', 'Cousteau-like', 'marine', 'biologist', 'explorer', 'who', 'be', 'baffled', 'own', 'species', 'premiere', 'newest', 'documentary', 'Zissou', 'crowd', 'get', 'revenge', 'legendary', 'Jaguar', 'Shark', 'devoured', 'friend', 'Why', 'Revenge', 'cobbling', 'together', 'new', 'odd', 'ducks', 'who', 'join', 'expedition', 'are', 'Ned', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'who', 'Zissou', 'father', 'pregnant', 'British', 'journalist', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'emotionally', 'insecure', 'German', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Ned', 'Zissou', 'try', 'work', 'out', 'odd', 'relationship', 'whimsical', 'Moby', 'Dick', 'quest', 'zoning', 'Jaguar', 'Shark', 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'Steve', 'Zissou', 'intriguing', 'beginning', 'glorious', 'finale', 'middle', 'just', 'bit', 'necessary', 'meat', 'bit', 'more', 'whimsical', 'Ahab', 'quest', 'keep', 'moving', 'Anderson', 'up', 'storytelling', 'gaps', 'using', 'unique', 'style', 'quirky', 'talents', 'actors', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'Dafoe', 'also', 'known', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'was', 'so', 'darn', 'funny.Actually', 'whole', 'idea', 'movie', 'pretty', 'intriguing', 'Jacques', 'Cousteau', 'Ahab', 'revenge', 'thang', 'Anderson', 'cinematic', 'quirks', 'high', 'Dancing', 'fish', 'Porteguese', 'covers', 'David', 'Bowie', 'pirate', 'attacks', 'take', 'place', 'surrounded', 'colorful', 'costumes', 'impossibly', 'bright', 'settings', 'sea', 'never', 'looked', 'so', 'blue', 'rarely', 'comedy', 'been', 'dry', 'quirky.And', 'Anderson', 'also', 'gaps', 'unique', 'way', 'conveying', 'well', 'best', 'term', 'deadpan', 'emotion', 'off', ""'m"", 'going', 'go', 'overnight', 'drunk', '10', 'days', ""'m"", 'going', 'set', 'out', 'find', 'shark', 'ate', 'friend', 'destroy', 'proceeds', 'mixture', 'comedy', 'pathos', 'lurking', 'just', 'surface', 'Nobody', 'tears', 'howls', 'rage', 'Anderson', 'prefers', 'just', 'let', 'actors', 'take', 'over', 'characters', 'only', 'problem', 'sometimes', 'cover', 'overstretched', 'plot', 'parts', 'it.Bill', 'Murray', 'best', 'when', 'quirky', 'deadpan', 'men', 'excellent', 'job', 'Zissou', 'Zissou', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaum', 'aging', 'child-man', 'who', 'stubborn', 'insensitive', 'very', 'clueless', 'Somehow', 'possibly', 'Murray', 'acting', 'charm', 'likable', 'Wilson', 'goofball', 'comedy', 'more', 'poignant', 'role', 'supporting', 'cast', 'especially', 'outstanding', 'Dafoe', 'wonderful', 'Blanchett', 'are', 'also', 'quite', 'solid', 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'Steve', 'Zissou', 'suffers', 'too', 'little', 'plot', 'places', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'worst', 'moments', 'still', 'swims', 'far', 'average', 'director', 'so', 'movie']",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
632199,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00005JNLQ,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 3]","This off-kilter but surprisingly involving movie feels like a jaundiced tribute to legendary oceanographer Jacques Cousteau, a reluctant father-needful son bonding parable and a contemporary update of ""Moby Dick"", all combined and filtered through the idiosyncratic eye of writer-director Wes Anderson. Along with co-writer Noah Baumbach, he has fashioned a fanciful episodic story around a cynical Cousteau-type celebrity named Steve Zissou, a role tailor-made for Bill Murray, who continues to resonate as an actor after his subtle, affecting work in Anderson's ""Rushmore"" and Sofia Coppola's ""Lost in Translation"". Here he even gets to play an action hero of sorts, as he defends his crew against rabid Filipino pirates onboard the elaborate though curiously antiquated Belafonte, a boat cut in half and filmed like a dollhouse stage set. Casting Murray is an essential component of the film's success since Zissou, now in his fifties, is not really passionate about the preservation of ocean life, at least not anymore, and much more into making movies, exhibiting the branding skills of a natural marketer and on the lookout for public relations and merchandising opportunities. Despite his business acumen, his reputation and fortunes have been on a long-term decline. It is near a personal abyss that he faces a tragedy, his lead diver and best friend has been killed by the never-seen jaguar shark in Part 1 of his documentary, and the media-savvy Zissou decides to take up his revenge against the shark in Part 2. Coincidentally, a mysterious ""son"" named Ned shows up, the product of a well-remembered affair. Zissou's initial idea of bonding is giving Ned a new name (Kingsley), personalized stationery and automatic membership as part of Team Zissou expedition, much to the jealous consternation of the blindly devoted engineer Klaus. Of course, women enter the picture and complicate matters, first in the form of Zissou's cold-fish ex-wife and business partner, Eleanor, who seems to be taking up with his bisexual nemesis, Hennessey, and second, with Jane, the pregnant and persistent journalist who eventually takes up with Ned. The convoluted elements somehow come together but not before all the strands intertwine in unexpected ways, whether it is on the Belafonte, the vertically impressive Operation Henessey Underwater Sea-Laboratory, or the remote island where the pirates have holed up in an abandoned resort hotel.A well-selected cast does exceptional work among the discombobulated shenanigans. The currently overexposed Owen Wilson portrays Ned/Kingsley with a believable navet&eacute; that makes you wonder - in a good way - how disingenuous his character may be. Willem Dafoe, of all people, makes Klaus such a touching and hilarious character that you can quite understand his pathetic pleas for attention from Zissou. The regal-bearing Anjelica Huston is in razor-sharp ""Grifters""-mode as Eleanor, and the typically brilliant Cate Blanchett makes the most of what is a wan observational role. Jeff Goldblum plays the slick Hennessey as well, Jeff Goldblum, and ""Harold and Maude"" cult personality Bud Cort makes a welcome return as the bond company milquetoast who gets taken hostage by the pirates. All the visual elements are great fun. Anderson smartly chooses to use Ray Harryhausen's old-fashioned stop-animation technique to produce the film's special effects, courtesy of Henry Selick, which mainly focus on the outrageous marine life. Robert Yeoman provides flexible camerawork, which emphasizes less on the actors and more on the creative production design by Mark Friedberg, especially of the somewhat dilapidated Belafonte. Ex-Devo lead singer Mark Mothersbaugh has composed the fittingly quirky score, which includes acoustic musical interludes by Seu Jorge, the Brazilian crew member who strums his guitar and sings David Bowie classics in Portuguese. And I do love the walking sequence under the final credits, which was lifted from the 1984 cult film, ""The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension"".As usual, Criterion does an amazing job with extras on the two-disc set beginning with the smart audio commentary track by Anderson and Baumbach, which is recorded over some muffled restaurant noises, apparently where they jointly worked on the script. I only wish Murray participated on some of the audio. On the first disc, other than the movie, there is a brief behind-the-scenes featurette, this one done for the STARZ network, as well as a series of brief, deleted snippets that add some context but were understandably excised to maintain the story's pacing. On the second disc, entitled appropriately ""Supplements"", there is a making-of documentary, ""This Is an Adventure""; superfluous character portraits by Wilson, Blanchett and Seymour Cassel, who plays the non-verbal role of Zissou's best friend at the beginning; an insightful video journal by Matthew Gray Gubler, who plays Intern #1; twelve video performances of Jorge; and video interviews with Anderson, Baumbach and Mothersbaugh. It's almost overwhelming but not quite.",4,Discombobulated Shenanigans in a Cousteau-Like World,1116028800,"05 14, 2005",2005,5095,"['off-kilter', 'surprisingly', 'involving', 'movie', 'feels',

Unfortunately, nothing profound or memorable.  The filmmaker definitely used some innovative techniques, and takes the concept of ""quirky"" to new extremes.  But despite the film's frantic efforts to entertain, and a few laugh-out-loud moments, most of the scenes just barely held my attention.  What's missing is a decent screenplay.  Some of the satirical treatments of organizations such as the Cousteau Society and their supporters were mildly amusing, and Bill Murray's dark and morally ambiguous character was well drawn.  But many of the scenes seemed like amateur home-movie level filler that had been improvised on the set.  It's as though a chef took truffles, caviar, and chocolate, and then tried to turn them into a tasty dish by cooking them all together in big bland pastry shell.  If this film had been produced on a very limited budget it would have been a praiseworthy effort, but other filmmakers have achieved vastly superior results with far fewer resources.

632206,A2WETFLJM0D6R0,B00005JNLQ,"ewomack ""ewomack""","[1, 1]","This film may not please everyone, and it probably won't go down as the best film of the decade, but lovers of dry deadpan humor will revel in every minute. The casting director deserves a big award for perfectly casting Bill Murray as the mostly washed up main character Steve Zissou. Inspired (mostly through parody) by legendary sea explorer Jacques Cousteau, Zissou runs a ramshackle  sea exploration outfit filled with a crew that has no background in deep sea diving or marine biology. They make documentaries about their ""adventures"" in oceanography. These hilariously stilted productions, featured throughout the movie, look barely better than home movies. Their incompetence becomes evident very early. Worst of all, the movie in which Zissou's best friend, Esteban, gets eaten by a ""Jaguar Shark"" comes across as a fake. In defiance, Zissou sets out to kill the shark that ate his friend. Along the way his rich wife leaves him, his alleged son (who works for ""Air Kentucky"") appears out of nowhere, they break into a competitor's sea lab and steal valuable equipment, their ship gets invaded by pirates in unprotected waters (Zissou knowingly leads them there and some interns get shot at), and they attempt to rescue the competitor that they stole from. Zissou comes across as a hopeless reprehensible greedy womanizing good for nothing. The film tries to take this character with all of his flaws and save him. The end of the movie reveals whether or not Zissou gets the redemption he seeks. He walks away into the Italian street with a child on his shoulders followed by a large crowd accompanied by David Bowie's ""Queen Bitch"" with its chorus blaring ""I can do better than that"". In other words, ""The Life Aquatic"" represents a character study of a single character. Zissou gets full multi dimensional treament. Consequently, the supporting characters remain somewhat two dimensional and undeveloped. But they all have a direct effect on Zissou as he carries out his mission. The plot focuses almost exclusively on whether or not Zissou can come out ahead with a load of expanding moral baggage on his back. In other words, ""The Life Aquatic"" deals with redemption.The film includes an impressive cast. Not only Bill Murray, but Cate Blanchett, Willem DaFoe, Anjelica Houston, and Jeff Goldblum. Blanchett was actually with child while filming (Nicole Kidman apparently vied for her part). Many great CG creations of imaginary sealife also make numerous appearances. These help emphasize that we're watching a fiction and a parody. Some of these amazing underwater creatures look right out of a medieval bestiary. Also, an amazing cutaway set of the ship was created for select scenes. These scenes play like theater as continuous tracking shots scan the massive structure in real time (and proclaim that the kitchen ""contains the most technologically advanced equipment on the ship"").Though it's ultimately dry, deadpan, and likely has limited appeal, ""The Life Aquatic"" represents a refreshing change from the typical ""screwball"" comedies, stale remakes, and gushing heart melting romantic comedies churned out by Hollywood these days. It's nice to see something different once in a while.",4,Something a little different... with fish...,1135641600,"12 27, 2005",2005,3206,"['film', 'may', 'not', 'please', 'everyone', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'down', 'as', 'best', 'film', 'decade', 'lovers', 'dry', 'deadpan', 'humor', 'will', 'revel', 'minute', 'casting', 'director', 'big', 'award', 'perfectly', 'casting', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'mostly', 'washed', 'up', 'main', 'character', 'Steve', 'Zissou', 'Inspired', 'mostly', 'parody', 'legendary', 'sea', 'explorer', 'Jacques', 'Cousteau', 'Zissou', 'ramshackle', 'sea', 'exploration', 'outfit', 'filled', 'crew', 'background', 'deep', 'sea', 'diving', 'marine', 'biology', 'make', 'documentaries', 'adventures', 'oceanography', 'hilariously', 'stilted', 'productions', 'featured', 'movie', 'look', 'barely', 'better', 'home', 'movies', 'incompetence', 'evident', 'very', 'early', 'Worst', 'movie', 'Zissou', 'best', 'friend', 'Esteban', 'eaten', 'Jaguar', 'Shark', 'across', 'fake', 'defiance', 'Zissou', 'out', 'kill', 'shark', 'ate', 'friend', 'way', 'rich', 'wife', 'alleged', 'son', 'who', 'Air', 'Kentucky', 'nowhere', 'break', 'competitor', 'sea', 'lab', 'steal', 'valuable', 'equipment', 'ship', 'invaded', 'pirates', 'unprotected', 'waters', 'Zissou', 'knowingly', 'interns', 'get', 'shot', 'attempt', 'rescue', 'competitor', 'stole', 'Zissou', 'across', 'hopeless', 'reprehensible', 'greedy', 'womanizing', 'good', 'nothing', 'film', 'take', 'character', 'flaws', 'save', 'end', 'movie', 'not', 'Zissou', 'redemption', 'away', 'Italian', 'street', 'child', 'shoulders', 'followed', 'large', 'crowd', 'accompanied', 'David', 'Bowie', 'Queen', 'Bitch', 'chorus', 'blaring', 'can', 'do', 'better', 'other', 'words', 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'character', 'study', 'single', 'character', 'Zissou', 'full', 'multi', 'dimensional', 'treament', 'Consequently', 'supporting', 'characters', 'remain', 'somewhat', 'two', 'dimensional', 'undeveloped', 'have', 'direct', 'effect', 'Zissou', 'out', 'mission', 'plot', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'not', 'Zissou', 'can', 'come', 'out', 'ahead', 'load', 'expanding', 'moral', 'baggage', 'back', 'other', 'words', 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'deals', 'redemption.The', 'film', 'impressive', 'cast', 'Not', 'only', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'Willem', 'DaFoe', 'Anjelica', 'Houston', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'Blanchett', 'was', 'actually', 'child', 'filming', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'apparently', 'vied', 'part', 'Many', 'great', 'CG', 'creations', 'imaginary', 'sealife', 'also', 'make', 'numerous', 'appearances', 'help', 'emphasize', ""'re"", 'watching', 'fiction', 'parody', 'amazing', 'underwater', 'creatures', 'look', 'right', 'medieval', 'bestiary', 'Also', 'amazing', 'cutaway', 'set', 'ship', 'was', 'created', 'select', 'scenes', 'scenes', 'play', 'like', 'theater', 'continuous', 'tracking', 'shots', 'scan', 'massive', 'structure', 'real', 'time', 'proclaim', 'kitchen', 'most', 'technologically', 'advanced', 'equipment', 'ship', 'ultimately', 'dry', 'deadpan', 'likely', 'limited', 'appeal', 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'refreshing', 'change', 'typical', 'screwball', 'comedies', 'stale', 'remakes', 'gushing', 'heart', 'melting', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'churned', 'out', 'Hollywood', 'days', 'nice', 'see', 'something', 'different', 'once', 'while']",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

632209,AS62A5MC52IEH,B00005JNLQ,Floyd the Barber,"[4, 5]","Bill Murray's ""Steve Zissou"" is a variation on ""Carl Spackler"": older and more restrained, but seemingly just as clueless and anarchic.  But Murray is the man both carried along and carrying by turns.  Indeed, his best character is, after all, the one swept up in streams of events in which he is sometimes placed, but out of which, at will, he can stand aside and superior to the events to assess.  (That is Murray's great gift, since it allows him to be actor and audience by turns, in and out of the action.  In many senses he breaks the fourth wall constantly without turning to the camera.)  This is a mannered production by Wes Anderson (ostensibly an homage to Jacques Cousteau) with quirks and little touches of humanity intermittently poking through the overglaze of, well really, old Hollywood.  (I remember thinking how, in some ways, this was like ""Beat the Devil."")  The story is simple:  Zissou, a Greek(?) Cousteau, becomes Ahab looking for his Moby Dick.  Implicated with his obsession is solvency:  people are beginning not to believe in the great sea captain and ocean-explorer.  He not only must avenge a friend eaten by a monstrous shark (seen only by him), he must film it to shore up his drastically slipping credibility - and restore his financial backers. Various (and variously) funny - and not-so-funny - vicissitudes occur along the way.  Murray is great here, but he is certainly helped by his stellar supporting cast of actors, including Owen Wilson, Angelica Huston, Willem Dafoe, Cate Blanchett, Jeff Goldblum and Michael Gambon:  these are generous and just excellent.

""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou"", is 60's landmark TV's ""The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau"", seen through a psychedelic prism, into an alternative underwater world where drinks are tipped, pot is smoked, sharks are hunted down for revenge, and the underwater exotics are revealed as childlike-drawn animated caricatures. Like the baby boomers in this film, I'm a little troubled that the scientific, fatherly Cousteau, patrolling the ocean depths in his cool submarine, discovering aquatic wonders and mysterious marine life, may have been more a manic Square Pants Sponge Bob, than the man most likely to seriously fulfill a Mr. Limpit fantasy. Granted, this film isn't ABOUT Jacques Cousteau, but then, why was it even made, if not to reveal the Hollywood cocktail stories that likely were told about him and his underwater expeditions? So be it. If you have a soft spot in your gill for Cousteau, you have to admire it. It seems you can catch a sea breeze of the real man somewhere in the chaos. It's scenic, funny, bizarre, and although it suffers from the dreaded, 'just-how-long-is-this-movie?' reach for the DVD cover, you can't easily look away.

632218,A25FDX17O3QKLT,B00005JNLQ,Hallstatt Prince,"[6, 7]","I like Wes Anderson's quirky and some times dark usually subtle sense of humor, his arty treatment to film and his concentration on interpersonal relationships. He has the skillful literate ability to show people as buffoons while at the same time being very touching. His banter between characters can be hilarious. It is a winning formula that continues in The Life Aquatic.Famed marine explorer Steve Zissou (Bill Murray) has a number of problems. His best friend was recently eaten by a shark, his fan base is shrinking and his rival is getting all of the available grant money. Then out of nowhere Ned Plimpton (played by Owen Wilson) appears to his rescue - however Plimpton just might be Zissou's son (the father-son theme is something we find reoccurring in Anderson films).Off the wacky crew (some of Anderson's standard players) go to find the shark that killed Zissou's friend. Murray and Wilson are magical together. The retro (and sometimes psychedelic) special effects add more of the weirdness for which Anderson is famous. And like in many of Anderson's films a liberal use of familiar tunes is used, this time a lot of David Bowie (nice odd ball early Bowie - Anderson is definitely a man after my own heart) and one Iggy and the Stooges classic, which typical to form are incredibly appropriate. A great cast (which includes William DaFoe and Bud Cort) helps to make this movie a winner.Second discs are now in vogue in selling DVDs and the second disc depending on the movie is sometimes a hit or miss.

632220,A1Y0HX12MCT6OR,B00005JNLQ,I'm Right,"[4, 6]","A girl who knows she is very beautiful and attractive rejects every guy that comes onto her, she just likes the attention and that's it; that's how I'd describe this movie. It's visually appealing, has a great cast of characters, and an interesting story about a burn out Jacques Cousteau character Steve Zissou who's mission is to hunt down a leopard shark (the movie makes up it's own creatures) that killed his best friend. However Wes Anderson purposely sabatoges any hook to engage the audience and kind of just assumes we'll like it. Lame move Wes, lame.It sounds like the coolest movie ever, but it doesn't really do anything that interesting with it's characters. Bill Murray is played well, he's the weary leader of the Zissou ship and there are some good scenes showing his character's vulnerable side. Owen Wilson is his maybe-son who's naively interested in Steve Zissou's sad career and tags along for the ride to bond more with his long lost maybe-father. Cate Blanchett's an alright actress but I don't see her purpose in this movie, she kind of just hangs around nagging Steve and screwing Owen Wilson. Willem Defoe is pretty funny in this as he assumes he's Steve's surrogate son and gets jealous of Owen Wilson being in the spotlight; I wish Wes Anderson took more time to develop this character instead of Cate Blanchett most of the time. Jeff Goldblum is interesting as Zissou's rival, a high class A-hole who has quite an adventure of his own later on in the movie. Angelica Whoston? She was so pointless and nonexistent in this movie it seems that Wes Anderson has a hard time writing women. Other characters are pretty shallow and vapidly written as just 'quirky' stereotypes, such as a woman who randomly shows her breasts for no reason, an account that defies Zissou's preconcieved notions about the accountant type, or the black guy with a guitar who will only sing David Bowie songs for that hipster cred (we get it Wes, you're a Bowie fan), they all seemed so pointless which tie into the whole pointlessness of the movie.I really thought I would like this movie, but instead it was kinda dull with some interesting parts. It has a good story, good characters, etc, everything going for it and yet it's like the movie calls you stupid for wanting to get involved. We don't really see much of Bill Murray as a captain or see much of his dreams or goals, instead we see his his father/son dynamic with Owen Wilson which could've made a good subplot but instead it's the main focus of the story and Zissou's mission to hunt down the shark is the subplot that you almost forget about until the very end. The visuals never really go anywhere either, the side shots of the ship were awesome to see, but that's about it. Zissou at one point in the movie sees a colorful gecko crawl onto his hand which he promptly flicks off, that seems to be Wes Anderson's apathetic approach to this movie's visuals as well, pointless filler the movie wants to get over with in order to get to the important/exciting stuff: who Cate Blanchett is sleeping with.The Life Aquatic is sort of a dramedy, but it never really gets dramatic and it never really gets funny, it's just stagnant. Like when Zissou orders his team to raid Jeff Goldblum's facility there was some golden oppurtunity for some funny dialogue and banter, but it pretty much just plays off with Steve saying ""Let's take this stuff"", to which sometimes naked chick replies ""are you crazy Steve??"". Eh. The whole thing just kind of exists, not caring about drawing your attention or going somewhere meaningful. All of the characters are basically underdeveloped except for the love triangle between Steve, Owen Wilson, and Cate F-ing Blanchett. Plus all the characters just look bored most of the time (even when they're attacked by pirates); maybe it suits how down in the dumps Steve Zissou's career has gone but I get the feeling it was Anderson trying to be 'quirky' with his movie.",2,Appealingly Unappealing,1336953600,"05 14, 2012",2012,3955,"['girl', 'who', 'very', 'beautiful', 'attractive', 'rejects', 'guy', 'just', 'attention', 'how', ""'d"", 'describe', 'movie', 'visually', 'appealing', 'great', 'cast', 'characters', 'interesting', 'story', 'burn', 'out', 'Jacques', 'Cousteau', 'character', 'Steve', 'Zissou', 'who', 'mission', 'hunt', 'down', 'leopard', 'shark', 'movie', 'up', 'own', 'creatures', 'killed', 'best', 'friend', 'However', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'purposely', 'hook', 'engage', 'audience', 'kind', 'just', ""'ll"", 'like', 'Lame', 'move', 'Wes', 'lame.It', 'sounds', 'coolest', 'movie', 'ever', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'anything', 'interesting', 'characters', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'played', 'well', 'weary', 'leader', 'Zissou', 'ship', 'are', 'good', 'scenes', 'showing', 'character', 'vulnerable', 'side', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'maybe-son', 'who', 'naively', 'interested', 'Steve', 'Zissou', 'sad', 'career', 'tags', 'ride', 'bond', 'more', 'long', 'lost', 'maybe-father', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'alright', 'actress', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'purpose', 'movie', 'kind', 'just', 'hangs', 'nagging', 'Steve', 'screwing', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Willem', 'Defoe', 'pretty', 'funny', 'Steve', 'surrogate', 'son', 'jealous', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'being', 'spotlight', 'wish', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'took', 'more', 'time', 'develop', 'character', 'instead', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'most', 'time', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'interesting', 'Zissou', 'rival', 'high', 'class', 'A-hole', 'who', 'quite', 'adventure', 'own', 'later', 'movie', 'Angelica', 'Whoston', 'was', 'so', 'pointless', 'nonexistent', 'movie', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'hard', 'time', 'writing', 'women', 'Other', 'characters', 'are', 'pretty', 'shallow', 'vapidly', 'written', 'just', 'stereotypes', 'such', 'woman', 'who', 'breasts', 'reason', 'account', 'Zissou', 'preconcieved', 'notions', 'accountant', 'type', 'black', 'guy', 'guitar', 'who', 'will', 'only', 'sing', 'David', 'Bowie', 'songs', 'hipster', 'cred', 'get', 'Wes', ""'re"", 'Bowie', 'fan', 'seemed', 'so', 'pointless', 'tie', 'whole', 'pointlessness', 'movie.I', 'really', 'thought', 'would', 'like', 'movie', 'instead', 'was', 'kinda', 'dull', 'interesting', 'parts', 'good', 'story', 'good', 'characters', 'etc', 'everything', 'going', 'yet', 'movie', 'stupid', 'wanting', 'get', 'involved', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'much', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'captain', 'see', 'much', 'dreams', 'goals', 'instead', 'see', 'father/son', 'dynamic', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'could', ""'ve"", 'made', 'good', 'subplot', 'instead', 'main', 'focus', 'story', 'Zissou', 'mission', 'hunt', 'down', 'shark', 'subplot', 'almost', 'forget', 'very', 'end', 'visuals', 'never', 'really', 'go', 'anywhere', 'either', 'side', 'shots', 'ship', 'were', 'awesome', 'see', 'one', 'point', 'movie', 'colorful', 'gecko', 'crawl', 'hand', 'promptly', 'off', 'be', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'apathetic', 'approach', 'movie', 'visuals', 'as', 'well', 'pointless', 'filler', 'movie', 'get', 'over', 'order', 'get', 'important/exciting', 'stuff', 'who', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'sleeping', 'with.The', 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'sort', 'dramedy', 'never', 'really', 'dramatic', 'never', 'really', 'funny', 'just', 'stagnant', 'when', 'Zissou', 'orders', 'team', 'raid', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'facility', 'there', 'was', 'golden', 'oppurtunity', 'funny', 'dialogue', 'banter', 'pretty', 'much', 'just', 'off', 'Steve', 'saying', 'Let', 'take', 'stuff', 'sometimes', 'naked', 'chick', 'replies', 'are', 'crazy', 'Steve', 'Eh', 'whole', 'thing', 'just', 'kind', 'exists', 'not', 'caring', 'drawing', 'attention', 'going', 'somewhere', 'meaningful', 'characters', 'are', 'basically', 'underdeveloped', 'love', 'triangle', 'Steve', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Cate', 'F-ing', 'Blanchett', 'characters', 'just', 'look', 'bored', 'most', 'time', 'even', 'when', ""'re"", 'attacked', 'pirates', 'maybe', 'suits', 'how', 'down', 'dumps', 'Steve', 'Zissou', 'career', 'gone', 'get', 'feeling', 'was', 'Anderson', 'trying', 'be', ""'quirky"", 'movie']",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
632221,A19JYLHD94K94D,B00005JNLQ,Itamar Katz,"[5, 6]","With his third major motion picture, Wes Anderson proves that he still doesn't give a damn what anybody thinks about him. The Life Aquatic is as eccentric, fresh and original as Anderson's previous films - Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums - and for my money, it's also the most solid of the three. This time, Bill Murray, who played a supporting role in both those films, is given the lead. Murray, who - partly thanks to Anderson - transformed in recent years from semi-washed up comedian to independent cinema's sweetheart (through appearances in films including, other than Rushmore, Sofia Coppola's Lost In Translation and Jim Jarmusch's Broken Flowers) creates one of the most wonderful characters of his career with celebrity undersea explorer Steve Zissou, clearly a tribute to the late Jacques Yves Cousteau, a classic anti-hero who is both despicable and absolutely lovable, which perfectly compliments Murray's renowned talents.Murray is not the only talent on board - The Life Aquatic boasts one of the most impressive ensemble casts seen in some time, one which includes Anjelica Huston, Willem Dafoe, Owen Wilson, Jeff Goldblum and Cate Blanchett, among others, all of whom give knockout performances. The fantastic actors, though - all perfectly cast - are just one piece of the puzzle in Anderson's vision, and The Life Aquatic, underneath a somewhat chaotic and disorganized surface, is a solid and steady film that bears the signs of a complete and well-thought out piece, assembled in its entirety in Anderson's mind - from the highly stylized visuals, the often dated, even campy, but very aesthetic, special effects, including animated sea-life by grand master of claymation Henry Selick (James and the Giant Peach, The Nightmare Before Christmas), to the unpolished dialogue, to the soundtrack, a large part of which being Portuguese versions of David Bowie songs, translated and performed by Seu George (City of God), who also plays in the film.The Life Aquatic is certainly not for everyone, and if you're looking for the Bill Murray of Caddyshack and Ghostbusters you'll be disappointed by the low joke ratio. If you enjoyed Anderson's previous works, by all means you should watch this one too. If you're open minded and are interested in cinema that is a little different, if you like directors like Terry Gilliam and the Coen Brothers, you should definitely give it a shot - maybe you won't get into the spirit of the thing, you might find it dumb and boring, but you should give it a shot - you may just find one of the freshest and most original films of the last few years.",5,"Bravo, Zissou!",1135900800,"12 30, 2005",2005,2604,"['third', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'still', ""n't"", 'give', 'damn', 'what', 'anybody', 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'eccentric', 'fresh', 'original', 'Anderson', 'previous', 'films', 'Rushmore', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'money', 'also', 'most', 'solid', 'three', 'time', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'who', 'played', 'supporting', 'role', 'films', 'given', 'lead', 'Murray', 'who', 'partly', 'thanks', 'Anderson', 'transformed', 'recent', 'years', 'semi-washed', 'up', 'comedian', 'independent', 'cinema', 'sweetheart', 'appearances', 'films', 'including', 'other', 'Rushmore', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'Jim', 'Jarmusch', 'Broken', 'Flowers', 'one', 'most', 'wonderful', 'characters', 'career', 'celebrity', 'undersea', 'explorer', 'Steve', 'Zissou', 'clearly', 'tribute', 'late', 'Jacques', 'Yves', 'Cousteau', 'classic', 'anti-hero', 'who', 'despicable', 'absolutely', 'lovable', 'perfectly', 'Murray', 'renowned', 'talents.Murray', 'not', 'only', 'talent', 'board', 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'one', 'most', 'impressive', 'ensemble', 'casts', 'seen', 'time', 'one', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'others', 'whom', 'give', 'knockout', 'performances', 'fantastic', 'actors', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'are', 'just', 'one', 'piece', 'puzzle', 'Anderson', 'vision', 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'somewhat', 'chaotic', 'disorganized', 'surface', 'solid', 'steady', 'film', 'signs', 'complete', 'well-thought', 'piece', 'assembled', 'entirety', 'Anderson', 'mind', 'highly', 'stylized', 'visuals', 'often', 'dated', 'even', 'campy', 'very', 'aesthetic', 'special', 'effects', 'including', 'animated', 'sea-life', 'grand', 'master', 'claymation', 'Henry', 'Selick', 'James', 'Giant', 'Peach', 'Nightmare', 'Before', 'Christmas', 'unpolished', 'dialogue', 'soundtrack', 'large', 'part', 'being', 'Portuguese', 'versions', 'David', 'Bowie', 'songs', 'translated', 'performed', 'Seu', 'George', 'City', 'God', 'who', 'also', 'film.The', 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'certainly', 'not', 'everyone', ""'re"", 'looking', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Caddyshack', 'Ghostbusters', ""'ll"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'low', 'joke', 'ratio', 'enjoyed', 'Anderson', 'previous', 'works', 'means', 'should', 'watch', 'one', 'too', ""'re"", 'open', 'minded', 'are', 'interested', 'cinema', 'little', 'different', 'like', 'directors', 'Terry', 'Gilliam', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'should', 'definitely', 'give', 'shot', 'maybe', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'spirit', 'thing', 'might', 'find', 'dumb', 'boring', 'should', 'give', 'shot', 'may', 'just', 'find', 'one', 'freshest', 'most', 'original', 'films', 'last', 'few', 'years']",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

I would say the tone and humor compares more to Rushmore than to Royal Tenebaums. In fact, Zissou and Rushmore's main character Max Fischer have lots of similarities. All of Anderson's trademark style is present here: Background/set humor, great music, and terrific dialogue. With all of this going on, it's Bill Murray who really excels here. His dry, sarcastic wit fits perfectly with Anderson's style (and is probably why he's been in three of his four movies), and now playing a main character (he had smaller roles in the other two Anderson movies) he is able to deliver the goods in spades. Cate Blanchett and Owen Wilson do marvelously, although I was disappointed in Willem Dafoe's performance. Overall, a joy to watch and a movie I will own.

I personally enjoy writer-director Wes Anderson's somewhat eccentric, (bizarre?), style. However, if you watched ""Rushmore"" and/or ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" and did not crack a smile, or thought about turning off the DVD player, you should stop reading here. ""The Life Aquatic"" is not for you. See, how helpful I have been? Now you don't need to read the entire review.For those of you who have chosen to remain with me, Bill Murray is at his best here - wry, witty, wacky, clever, typically dead pan, totally self-absorbed, and once in a while, comedically tragic...or morosely sentimental! Think of this as a mega-fish story, with Murray as Steve Zissou, a Jacques Cousteau kinda guy. He, just like Cousteau, is an internationally famous oceanographer, who makes underwater documentaries, and wears a Cousteau-like knitted red cap - but Steve's has a pom-pom on top of his. Unlike Cousteau, however, Steve's a pothead. The ship resembles Cousteau's famous state of the art Calypso - but here it is named the Belafonte. Get it? Belafonte used to sing calypso. Hehehe. Well, that's the kind of humor you'll find with Team Zissou. I think it's hilarious...but that's me and this is just a warning.

During the film's 1st stage, Part 1, Zissou's partner and close friend Esteban, is devoured by a Great Jaguar Shark, like Jonah and the whale. However, I think the Jaguar Shark, which makes ""Jaw's"" monster Great White look like a guppy, does a bit more crunching and munching. There's blood in the water! In other words, Esteban is not swallowed whole! Steve takes an emotional turn for the worse after the death, and his Captain Ahab side emerges, as he goes in quest of vengeance, to reap havoc upon the great leviathan.Underneath all the fame and misfortune, Steve is an insecure, middle-age man in the midst of a long-term mid-life crisis. He feels like a wash-out, his best years behind him. However, he does manage to recover enough self-esteem to hit on pregnant, unmarried journalist Jane Winslett-Richardson, (Cate Blanchett), who is writing a magazine feature about the expedition. When Steve is approached on the eve of the voyage by Ned Plimpton, (Owen Wilson), an intelligent young Southern gentleman and an airplane pilot for Kentucky Airlines, he is forced to confront his past. Ned may be his son, a love child. Zissou gives the young man a red cap and a Speedo, like the rest of the crew, and invites him to be his new assistant. He also renames him Kingsley (Ned) Zissou and buys him embossed stationery with his new moniker.Other wild and crazy team members are the faithful, and ever so strange, German assistant Klaus, (Willem Dafoe), Jeff Goldblum as Steve's arch rival, nemesis, and much better financed competitor, Hennessey, (who wears an ""I'm A Pepper"" T-shirt), Michael Gambon is the supercilious financier Drakoulias, and Bud Cort plays the amiable, mild-mannered bond company rep, called the ""Bond Stooge,"" who fortunately happens to speak Tagalog. I say fortunately because they are boarded at one point by vicious Philippine pirates. So add some Tom Clancy action, an extreme and perverse version, along with Moby Dick, the Bill Murray/Jacques Cousteau shtick, and director Wes Anderson's shenanigans - are you getting the picture?The Zissou crew of mongrel miscreants returns to the water once again to film Part 2. Other team members are an ex bus driver, a former substitute teacher, a topless script girl, and various summer interns who don't get paid, but do get college credits for mixing Steve's Camparis on the rocks and acting as all around gofers. Eleanor, (Anjelica Huston), is Mrs. Zissou number 2 or 3. She comes from a wealthy family, who is frequently called upon to foot the bill for the underwater ventures. Eleanor thinks she'll sit out the hunt for Moby shark. She takes off for their private island, abandoning her post as the chief logistics officer. This stresses everyone, except Mrs. Zissou. Eleanor is considered the brains behind Zissou and Co..There are some wonderful details in the film, especially when the crew submerges in their updated WWII submarine. The fanciful, sometimes psychedelic sea creatures are created by Henry Selick. There are rhinestone bluefish, a crayoned coat of many colored seahorse, beautifully striped sugar crabs, and the most marvelous Jaguar Shark. As I mentioned, we are also treated to a pirate attack, (where Steve saves the day), a hostage rescue, (where Steve saves the day), a mutiny, (during which Steve grovels for love and sympathy), a romance, (where Steve's a loser), death and violence...none of which is to be taken seriously. Seriously. Well, maybe there are one or two solemn moments. Otherwise, ""The Life Acuatic"" is a lark. And perhaps, I'm warped.JANA",4,"Hilarious, Bizarre, Not To Be Taken Seriously, & Definitely Not A Film For Everyone!",1122508800,"07 28, 2005",2005,4973,"['Truth', 'be', 'told', 'NOT', 'film',

632232,A140XH16IKR4B0,B00005JNLQ,Jean E. Pouliot,"[8, 11]","""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" is a film you have to work hard to like. It has so much potential: quirky characters, plotline and writing. In the end, it fails to reach the promised heights. But as with with the 3-legged dog featured in the film, I couldn't stop hoping that it would make the big jump, just this once.The plot revolves around Steve Zissou, an oceanographer languishing in a ten-year slump. His films are amateurish, dull and unpopular. While filming his latest oeuvre, his best friend is eaten by a ""jaguar shark"" - a beast that many suspect exists only in Zissou's imagination. Zissou, hoping to avenge his friend and in the process restore his reputation vows to hunt down the shark.The main drag on the action is the self-conscious posturing of the cast. Director Wes Anderson confuses deadpan delivery of lines with quirky comedy, and thus drains the personality from his characters. His writing must have looked terrific late at night on the page, but when transplanted to the screen, it is highly artificial.The casting held great promise and included gems like Angelica Huston, Owen Wilson, Michael Caine and Willem Dafoe. Selecting Bill Murray for the lead role is perfectly in keeping with Anderson's smug approach to filmmaking. At his worst, Murray projects the smirking sense that he knows he is oh so funny; at his best, as in ""Lost in Translation,"" this deadpan approach conveys a sense of being lost and vulnerable. In ""The Life Aquatic,"" Murray oscillates maddeningly between these two modes. Only Cate Blanchett, playing a journalist writing a feature on Zissou, seems to have understood that a character's quirks come from the soul of a fleshed-out character - not from mannered posturing. When Blanchett joins the film about 1/3 of the way through, it finally comes to life.TLA lost many opportunities to be a great film. Why, for instance, develop an oceangoing vessel, crew uniforms and a mission in the mode of Jacques Cousteau but fail to include any references to the French oceanographer? Or was that the joke? And what's with the crewman singing David Bowie songs in Portuguese? Or the script girl who appears topless - sometimes? Tr&egrave;s college film school.Given my distaste for many of the scenes that made it into the film, I couldn't bear to watch the deleted scenes. A mini-feature on the cast and director was expectedly self-congratulatory. Or if you listen closely, you might notice the actors giving themselves qualified kudos, as when a parent praises a child's overloud music performance as ""really easy to hear!"" I can't exactly recommend the film, but found it fascinating in spite of its self-referential narcissism.

Somehow, with ""The Life Aquatic,"" a bright, literate filmmaker has turned out a flick that's just as flat and void of life as the current Hollywood dreck his fans surely revile. Not only is this film no better than something as pointless as, say, ""Blade - Trinity,"" it's also a bore to have to sit through. To endure ""The Life Aquatic,"" we the audience have the misfortune of watching a bunch of people we can't care much about spending a long time doing...well...nothing especially interesting. Sure, Bill Murray, Cate Blanchett, Owen Wilson and the rest bring their game. But even such a (truly) stellar ensemble can't rise above the inertia of a film that feels like it just never quite gets started.The problem is not, as Andersonphiles would kid themselves, that the humor is sooo subtle that most people won't get it. Instead, Anderson breaks the one rule that matters most when it comes to being funny (that is: BE FUNNY). Unlike in his earlier films in which quirkiness was tossed in to augment and accent humor, in ""The Life Aquatic,"" Anderson seems to think that quirkiness in and of itself is a perfectly suitable substitute for humor. So, those characters you can't care much about? Those folks who spend two hours hopping around from one tepid adventure to another? Well, they're not very funny, either. Oh, some of 'em are quirky, alright...just not funny.To be sure, ""The Life Aquatic,"" will have its following. Or, more accurately, its defenders among Wes Anderson's fan base. But like Stanley ""Eyes Wide Shut"" Kubrick, John ""Reindeer Games"" Frankenheimer and other notable directors before him, Wes Anderson is bound to shoot a blank now and then. So, ready that mouse, Andersonphiles!

The most overused and strangely misleading observation is that they're snob-infested and consumed in their own deadpan wit. And that's where ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" comes in with the story of a pothead oceanographer and his goofy crew, including a brazilian musician who's there simply to play David Bowie songs acoustic in portugese (rock) and his could-be son. Some people must not give their brains much credit if they've deemed this movie over their heads, and others who take themselves too seriously will feel that this movie is too silly. It's a comedy people, not brain surgery. This needs no decoding, it just needs minds that haven't already decided what Wes Anderson is or isn't. This is by far the most fun and outlandish of his films, and even though it's not as subtle as The Royal Tenenbaums, which IS outlandish in it's own quiet half-parody of J. D. Salinger novels, this is his most accessible movie and it's not bad. I will say that the visuals are really a treat, as they're not as much impressive in any realistic sort of fashion, but rather in it's ability to root out the essence of what the image of the movie is putting forth and creating the whole world in which the film revolves within it, making every frame a snapshot into this snow-globe storybook dreamworld of the ocean. The humor is timeless and hilarious; absolute must-see scenes include Zissou's rock and roll 70s copshow-esque shootout (set to the delightfull tunes of non other than Iggy himself), the ruscue mission of the bond-company stooge, and of course, the hilarious openning documentary. As for the Criterion Collection release, this is no exception to their series. I highly doubt Criterion will ever release anything below impeccable quality; the features outnumber those found on the Criterion releases of ""Rushmore"" and ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" and frankly, if you buy all three they look really cool lined up, and if you're a Wes Anderson fanatic I think you'll be one happy camper.

The screenplay resorts to crude language for humor, which can work at times, but not even Bill Murray can breathe much life into this soporific stinker.But I'll cite one exception that made me laugh out loud: When Zissou, the professional naturalist, sensitive to all creatures great and small, is asked what kind of cat his dead cat was, his reply, in inimitable Bill Murray fashion is: ""Who gives a s--t.""If you think a work is not interesting, engaging, or humorous, and you find many others also think it is not interesting, engaging, or humorous, then you may rely that there will be those who claim it is ""Zen,"" or art, or in some other way unaccesible to philistines like you, but special only to the rarified few who can really appreciate such depth.

A classic line in the movie for me would be when Steve Zissou (Bill Murray) has just met his twenty something year old son, Ned, for the first time. Zissou is standing there with his son and someone he knows stops to talk to him. He introduces his son to the man by saying, ""This is probably my son Ned.""

The only movie I've seen by him that I really liked was ""Rushmore."" It's one of my favorite movies. This film, ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" is an improvement from his previous film...But, I'm not sure why it's billed as a comedy. It's not funny. It has a couple of funny jokes, but nothing that made me laugh-out-loud. I'm not sure how a movie like this doesn't work. Anderson co-wrote the script with Noah Baumbach (who wrote one of the best films of 2005, 'The Squid & the Whale') and look at the cast of the movie. The cast is wonderful...But,""The Royal Tenenbaums"" had a wonderful cast too. The movie stars Oscar nominee Bill Murray (Best Actor, 'Lost in Translation') as the title character, Steve Zissou...An oceanographer. Zissou is famous for films he makes about his underwater expeditions, but lately his films have started to fail. Then, his best friend Esteban (Seymour Cassel, 'Rushmore') is killed by a mysterious, elusive, and possibly nonexistent Jaguar Shark. As he prepares to set off on a mission to hunt and kill the shark, Steve meets his son Ned (Oscar nominee Owen Wilson, Best Original Screenplay 'The Royal Tenenbaums'). Anyway Steve sets off with his crew Team Zissou to find the shark; Add in a hostage situation and a few shootouts and you have ""The Life Aquatic."" Additional cast members include Anjelica Huston ('Buffalo 66') as Eleanor Zissou, Steve's estranged wife and co-producer. Willem Dafoe ('The Boondock Saints') as Klaus, one of Steve's German team members. Oscar Winner Cate Blanchett (Best Supporting Actress, 'The Aviator') as a journalist named Jane Winslett-Richarson, who is writing an article about Steve. Jeff Goldblum ('The Fly') as Eleanor's ex-husband and Steve's nemesis Alistair Hennessey. There's others including Bud Cort ('Harold & Maude') and Michael Gambon ('Harry Potter & the Goblet of Fire'), so yeah...This movie has a cast that most directors would kill for. There's also one crew member who frequently strums David Bowie songs and sings them in Portugese. One of my biggest problems with Wes Anderson is that he works on a multi-million dollar budget and yet he makes his films look like independent films. Don't get me wrong, I love independent films. I just don't like wannabe independent films. This movie has a very cheap look to it, simalar to a documentary...Which is what Anderson was going for, I guess. The movie was fairly entertaining, but I keep expecting him to top ""Rushmore"" and am disappointed everytime he doesn't. Bill Murray and the rest of the cast are great and if you liked ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" you'll like this movie...But, for me, it just didn't click.GRADE: Between a B- and a C",4,The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou,1153094400,"07 17, 2006",2006,2798,"[""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'just', 'get', 'way', 'much', 'acclaim', 'hated', 'Royal', 'Tennenbaums', 'only', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'really', 'liked', 'was', 'Rushmore', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'film', 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'Steve', 'Zissou', 'improvement', 'previous', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'billed', 'comedy', 'not', 'funny', 'couple', 'funny', 'jokes', 'nothing', 'made', 'laugh-out-loud', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'movie', ""n't"", 'work', 'Anderson', 'co-wrote', 'script', 'Noah', 'Baumbach', 'who', 'wrote', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2005', ""'The"", 'Squid', 'Whale', 'look', 'cast', 'movie', 'cast', 'wonderful', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'had', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'too', 'movie', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Translation', 'title', 'character', 'Steve', 'Zissou', 'oceanographer', 'Zissou', 'famous', 'films', 'underwater', 'expeditions', 'lately', 'films', 'have', 'started', 'fail', 'Then', 'best', 'friend', 'Esteban', 'Seymour', 'Cassel', ""'Rushmore"", 'killed', 'mysterious', 'elusive', 'possibly', 'nonexistent', 'Jaguar', 'Shark', 'set', 'off', 'mission', 'hunt', 'kill', 'shark', 'Steve', 'son', 'Ned', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Best', 'Original', 'Screenplay', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'Anyway', 'Steve', 'off', 'crew', 'Team', 'Zissou', 'find', 'shark', 'Add', 'hostage', 'situation', 'few', 'shootouts', 'have', 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'Additional', 'cast', 'members', 'include', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', '66', 'Eleanor', 'Zissou', 'Steve', 'estranged', 'wife', 'co-producer', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Boondock', 'Saints', 'Klaus', 'one', 'Steve', 'German', 'team', 'members', 'Oscar', 'Winner', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', ""'The"", 'Aviator', 'journalist', 'named', 'Jane', 'Winslett-Richarson', 'who', 'writing', 'article', 'Steve', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'Fly', 'Eleanor', 'ex-husband', 'Steve', 'nemesis', 'Alistair', 'Hennessey', 'others', 'including', 'Bud', 'Cort', ""'Harold"", 'Maude', 'Michael', 'Gambon', ""'Harry"", 'Potter', 'Goblet', 'Fire', 'so', 'yeah', 'movie', 'cast', 'most', 'directors', 'would', 'kill', 'also', 'one', 'crew', 'member', 'who', 'frequently', 'David', 'Bowie', 'songs', 'sings', 'Portugese', 'One', 'biggest', 'problems', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'multi-million', 'dollar', 'budget', 'yet', 'films', 'look', 'independent', 'films', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'love', 'independent', 'films', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'wannabe', 'independent', 'films', 'movie', 'very', 'cheap', 'look', 'documentary', 'Which', 'what', 'Anderson', 'was', 'going', 'guess', 'movie', 'was', 'fairly', 'entertaining', 'keep', 'expecting', 'top', 'Rushmore', 'am', 'disappointed', 'everytime', ""n't"", 'Bill', 'Murray', 'rest', 'cast', 'are', 'great', 'liked', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', ""'ll"", 'like', 'movie', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'click.GRADE', 'Between', 'B-', 'C']",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

Wes's style reminds me of her father's in that he creates seductive environments in order to tell a story - like John Huston did in Moulin Rouge, The Dead, The Maltese Falcon, etc. But Wes seems to let the scenes and dialogue evolve out of that, just letting them be what they are, so that instead of the usual contrived space-filling dialogue, the characters talk and act like I can believe they might actually do given their circumstances.

632248,A2PXHFGJZBNLXB,B00005JNLQ,Kenji Fujishima,"[0, 0]","I wasn't a great fan of Wes Anderson's THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS, believing that the potentially touching story Anderson tried to tell with his kooky cast of characters was often submerged under a lot of precious, self-consciously offbeat style. And yet, after seeing his latest film THE LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU, I just might be compelled to give TENENBAUMS another chance one day.I should have perhaps realized it with RUSHMORE, but I think watching THE LIFE AQUATIC helped me understand why Anderson has the following that he does: it must be a sense of childlike innocence and wonder that Anderson fans are responding to. The man, it seems to me, doesn't have a cynical bone in his body. There is a generous heart to his sensibility that must charm a lot of people, and while I thought his rather forced whimsical touches somewhat obscured that heart in THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS, somehow Anderson's typically offbeat touches---the introduction of pirates into the plot, the Greek chorus of one Seu Jorge singing David Bowie songs in Portuguese---only seems to enhance the delight of Anderson's child-like yet singularly deep and humane vision.Anderson is also lucky to have Bill Murray on top form in this film, playing a man-child who dislikes adult responsibilities but, in this film's version of a midlife crisis, realizes he eventually has to take them on anyway...especially when a young man named Ned Plimpton (Owen Wilson) appears on the scene and says that he is Zissou's son. It's a wonderfully-written role with quite a bit of emotional and dramatic complexity, and Murray is vivid and genuinely touching in his interpretation of Zissou as a man who, as his creative juices start to dry, is starting to take stock in his life and reflect on what his legacy could be.Murray's role, though, is admittedly the only character with any real depth...not necessarily a problem, I suppose, since Zissou and his external and internal conflicts are what the movie is about. The only real problem with this movie is its plotting: instead of focusing itself solely on Zissou and his search for the ""jaguar shark"" that killed a best friend of his, Anderson and co-writer Noah Baumbach find it cool to introduce detours like pirates into the mix. Such detours threaten to blunt the emotional impact that these characters are meant to have.That THE LIFE AQUATIC emerges from its rambling plot smelling like roses is perhaps a tribute to not only how good Bill Murray is in this film, but perhaps also how visually beautiful it is. Anderson has a way of framing and setting up his shots so that they look obviously composed rather than spontaneously achieved. In RUSHMORE, the feeling engendered by his singular style was surprisingly claustrophobic (surprising for a 2.35:1 film), and in THE ROYAL TENANBAUMS, I thought it was a little distracting. But cinema is a visual medium, above all, and why should we be so harsh to a director who fixates as much as Anderson does on visual framing and set design? Especially if the results are as lovely as they sometimes are in this film? There are some wondrous shots here, particularly when Anderson shoots some of the animated sea creatures created for the film by Henry Selick. They looked so good on my TV that it made me wish that I had seen this movie in a theater, where the much-larger dimensions---combined with Anderson's usual widescreen format---might have made for an even more enveloping experience.THE LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU surprised me. After being less than overwhelmed by THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS, I expected this movie to be more of the same. In some ways, it is; Anderson is still occasionally trying to let us know just how damn creative he is (haha, David Bowie songs sung in Portuguese, haha). But I responded to Anderson's humane vision and to his whimsical touches more positively here. It may not be a masterpiece, but I will grant Anderson this: here is a director with a refreshing lack of cynicism, and with a concern for characters that ought to be cherished these days. Certainly, the movie has made me perhaps re-assess some of my views of Wes Anderson.

632249,A1OBJ2263JCK5,B00005JNLQ,Kenneth M. Gelwasser,"[6, 8]","Wes Anderson's whimsical, comedy, ""The life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" is one of those films, that your either going to absolutely love or absolutely hate. There is no middle ground in the matter. To be truthful, I tried to stay away from this movie as long as possible, due to the inordinate amount of bad reviews I had seen. I finally rented it from the local video store only because my wife practically demanded to see it. (She claims it was because she was intriged by the theatrical trailer). I finally gave up, figuring I was about to waste my evening. Well, we started to watch this thing and before you know it, I found myself totally sucked into this strange, little movie. I don't know if it was Bill Murray's comic talents, the peculiar characters or the hilariously, ironic script, but after awhile my wife and I were just laughing our a_ _'s off! For those who don't know, ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" is basically a take-off on the real life, undersea explorer, Jacques Cousteau and his educational documentries. When the film opens, Explorer, Steve Zissou (Bill Murray) has just previewed (to tepid response) his latest film, which features his best friend Estaban (Seymour Cassel) being eaten by a supposed, Jaguar Shark. Zissou is basically tired and washed up both professionally and in his personal life. He feels like life is passing him by and he's wondering, why it's taking so long. Zissou decides to secure financing and take one last shot at mounting an expedition to find the undersea beast, who ate his best friend and get revenge, by killing it! Along, with his inept crew, Zissou is joined by a young man named Ned Plimpton (Owen Wilson), who may or may not his illegitamate son and a pregnant, magazine writer named Jane (Cate Blanchett), who is writing a hatchet piece. Basically, anything, that could go wrong on this expedition, does go wrong. Every decision, that Zissou makes invariably leads to horrble consequences for everyone involved. It seems like no one in this film can remain unscathed either personally or professionally by the ineptitude, that is prevalent. When Zissou finally meets up with his beastly, undersea nemesis, the film takes a surreal almost beautiful turn. Director/Writer, Wes Anderson seems to be able to create his own unique and quirky world populated by whimsical characters, who are full of surprises. I doubt you would ever meet people like this in real life, yet they endlessly keep the viewer interested. Anderson's script is quite literate and a step above the usual, 'by-the-numbers', uninspired writing that usually comes out of Hollywood. The cast in this film is superb. Bill Murray as the exasperated explorer, gives his best comically slow burn, deadpan looks yet. Cate Blanchett and Owen Wilson, also give fine comic performances. Other actors in the ensemble that really shine include Angelica Houston as Zissou's wife, Jeff Goldblum as the explorer's more successful competition, Michael Gambon as the expedition's money man and Willem Dafoe as a hilariously, jealous & needy member of the film crew. Finally, I want to mention the film's wonderful  soundtrack & score, which features both quirky electronic music as well as actor, Seu Jorge playing acoustic guitar and singing David Bowie songs in Portugeuse. It just totally goes with this movie. Some folk's get this film's off-kiltered humor, while others don't. I thought it was really funny and I hope you do to!

632255,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B00005JNLQ,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[6, 10]","At first glance, The Life Aquatica with Steve Zissou by Wes Anderson seems to be an awkward visual feast with no chemistry, or feel, as it is a film about making a documentary.  In a sense the acting and filming seem quaint, as the characters communicate, but never engage in any meaningful exchange of words.  This leaves the viewer with a feeling of detachment and discontent, as it produces an atmosphere of problematic motionlessness with vague ripples.  Much of the film seems to go on forever while very little time has actually has passed.  A sense of being adrift in an infinite void comes to mind, but also the same feeling a person has when being stuck on the ocean with no land in sight is thought of.  This suggests that Anderson tries to instill a sense of oceanic separation in the audience, which he does with brilliant direction.Most of the film takes place at sea; however, the film opens with a premier of Steve Zissou's (Bill Murray) recent documentary in which he lost his best friend to what he calls a Jaguar Shark.  In the question and answer session after the film, someone asks Steve why he would kill the shark that might be an endangered species.  To this Steve simply responds, ""Revenge."" Later Steve drifts around in melancholy while people call on him to meet more people.  This scene has a strong sense of symbolic meaning, as the audience could empathize with Steve who appears much like a bottled message that drifts around on the ocean without contacting land.  The scene also provides the notion that Steve tries to bottle up everything within him, as he does not express much emotion.The party drifts from the theater to the Belafonte, the ship from which Steve and his crew run their marine operations, where Steve for the first time meets his 30-year old pilot son, Ned Plimpton (Owen Wilson).  The emotional rift between Steve and Ned is obvious, yet a peculiar connection appears between the two.  The film continues intermittently to explore the reunion between the father and the long lost son, as Steve brings him under his wing by letting him join the Zissou organization.  Throughout the film, the audience gets to witness how Steve maintains his emotional distance to Ned.  Steve's persona seems to affect everything onboard the Belafonte, as the crew seems discontent with Steve's leadership while others are hurt by his choices.  Eventually all of the problems bottled up problems begin to seep out little by little, as Steve discovers that he is loosing control of his venture to avenge the death of his friend.Steve restrains his feelings while small portions seep out creating ripples in his personal and professional life while it later creates havoc onboard the Belafonte.  These ripples affect his relationship with his wife Eleanor Zissou (Anjelica Huston), as their strained relationship seems to slowly dissolve.  Jane Winslett-Richardson (Cate Blanchett), a pregnant British reporter, goes on the expedition for the Jaguar Shark.  When Steve meets her he finds her attractive while also treating her with a level of distrust.  His professional attitude seems to diminish, as he continues to treat people unusually.  Even his faithful assistant Klaus Daimler (Willem Dafoe) gradually becomes hostile toward Ned.  This hostility seems to source from Klaus' anxiety of his importance aboard the Belafonte, which is much due to Steve's emotional dilemma and the arrival of Ned.Despite the difficulties, the audience gets to witness a voyage of melancholy and emotional retribution that pays off big dividends, as cognitive recognition of self-destruction finds a solution.  This ends up being a solution where trust, open communication, and honest affection for one another turn the pages away from anxious motionlessness and ripples of resentment.  Through the solution, Anderson presents the idea that the oceans waves can also be harmoniously soothing and comforting, as he maximizes on the analogy that the sea offers in the film.  This offers the idea that personal emotional storm is analogous to the eye of a hurricane where nothing can enter or exit without damage.  Nonetheless, all hurricanes eventually die off leaving the survivor in a chaotic mess where everything around has been tossed around.  Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou does exactly what the hurricane does; as the serene waves of solution provides ultimate closure for the audience.Initially, the film gives the impression to be a quirky cinematic journey that Anderson has offered through his pervious wittingly compelling Bottle Rocket (1996), or his clever Rushmore (1998).  Despite the similarities with his previous films, Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou displays another level of Anderson's artistic side, as he elaborates on the origin of human detachment through marvelously cool stop-motion of sea creatures and a clever performance from a brilliant cast.  The camera work displays additional elements that enhance the feeling of being on the ocean while framing each scene in a way that accentuates distance and emptiness.  There is also a sequence in the film that maps out the boat that Anderson incorporated into the film, which brings to mind a scene from Tout Va Bien (1972) where Jean-Luc Godard maps out the meat factory.  Lastly, the score is excellent; as the main score seems to be missing something while it provides a sound that makes one think of underwater adventure. Combined, all the filmmaking facets pour out a sympathetic tale of distance and belonging that leaves the audience in astonishing wonder.",5,Wes Anderson's Ripple Affects All...,1115251200,"05 5,

632256,A1E85KPLPYVW8E,B00005JNLQ,"Kolors ""Jimmy""","[2, 4]","I've always had a hard time stomaching Wes Anderson's odd-ball, eccentric artsy-fartsy style, especially after the release of The Royal Tenenbaums, which I hated because of its flat humor, completely uninteresting story line and extremely unlikeable characters. Rushmore was decent, but nothing I found exceptional. But with the release of The Life Aquatic, Wes Anderson has concocted a film that is both visually and stylistically appealing, and is filled with memorable and interesting characters surrounded by a sea faring revenge documentary adventure. And it's actually funny.What really drove this movie was Bill Murray's performance as the insincere famous oceanographer/filmmaker Steve Zissou. This kind of character is so Bill Murray's style and it's hard to picture anyone else playing Steve Zissou, it almost makes you wonder if Wes Anderson had Bill Murray in mind for the character when writing the story.And not just Bill Murray, but Owen Wilson, Jeff Goldblum, Cate Blanchett and Angelica Houston all perform nicely. Even Willem Dafoe's small part is done very well, and quite hilariously I might add.Besides the acting, I really liked the overall story line that never lacked in having a hilarious sense of adventure and danger as Steve Zissou's crew goes an on a crazy and irrational sea quest to document Zissou's revenge on the infamous Jaguar Shark that supposedly ate his best friend Esteben. More importantly, its actually about Steve's relations with Ned, a man that's probably his son that he never knew.So where The Royal Tenebaums failed at producing interesting characters and story line, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou is completely the opposite and it's without that ""I'm-sorry-if-you-can't-follow-my-artsy-sophisticated-style"" feel to it, thank God.",4,A Wes Anderson Film I Can Stand,1117238400,"05 28, 2005",2005,1783,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'stomaching', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'odd-ball', 'eccentric', 'artsy-fartsy', 'style', 'especially', 'release', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'hated', 'flat', 'humor', 'completely', 'uninteresting', 'story', 'line', 'extremely', 'unlikeable', 'characters', 'Rushmore', 'was', 'decent', 'nothing', 'found', 'exceptional', 'release', 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'concocted', 'film', 'visually', 'stylistically', 'appealing', 'filled', 'memorable', 'interesting', 'characters', 'surrounded', 'sea', 'faring', 'revenge', 'documentary', 'adventure', 'actually', 'funny.What', 'really', 'drove', 'movie', 'was', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'performance', 'insincere', 'famous', 'oceanographer/filmmaker', 'Steve', 'Zissou', 'kind', 'character', 'so', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'style', 'hard', 'picture', 'anyone', 'else', 'playing', 'Steve', 'Zissou', 'almost', 'wonder', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'had', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'mind', 'character', 'when', 'writing', 'story.And', 'not', 'just', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'Angelica', 'Houston', 'perform', 'nicely', 'Even', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'small', 'part', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'quite', 'hilariously', 'might', 'add.Besides', 'acting', 'really', 'liked', 'overall', 'story', 'line', 'never', 'lacked', 'having', 'hilarious', 'sense', 'adventure', 'danger', 'Steve', 'Zissou', 'crew', 'crazy', 'irrational', 'sea', 'quest', 'document', 'Zissou', 'revenge', 'infamous', 'Jaguar', 'Shark', 'supposedly', 'ate', 'best', 'friend', 'Esteben', 'More', 'importantly', 'actually', 'Steve', 'relations', 'Ned', 'man', 'probably', 'son', 'never', 'knew.So', 'where', 'Royal', 'Tenebaums', 'failed', 'producing', 'interesting', 'characters', 'story', 'line', 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'Steve', 'Zissou', 'completely', 'opposite', ""I'm-sorry-if-you-can't-follow-my-artsy-sophisticated-style"", 'feel', 'thank', 'God']",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

Bernabo,"[2, 2]","Saying that a movie starring Bill Murray is strange hardly seems a revelation, but ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" is certainly out there in its own little universe.  The obvious cinematic reference point for this 2004 film is 2001's ""The Royal Tenenbaums,"" since Wes Anderson directed both of them, but this quirky film has a better payoff, although I would be hard pressed to argue out exactly how that is accomplished.  Murray is the hook to get people to see this movie, but the rest of the fishing paraphernalia belongs to Anderson.Steve Zissou (Murray) is either a parody of, or a homage to deep sea explorer Jacques Cousteau (it works either way but I lean towards the latter interpretation).  Zissou has been making documentaries for decades, but now his star is in decline and to add insult to injury, his best friend is devoured by a ""Jaguar Shark.""  This turns Zissou into Captain Ahab but before he can set sail on the good ship ""Belafonte"" (famous for his calypso singing, which, it turns out, was the name of Cousteau's own good ship), a couple of newcomers show up for the ride.  Ned Plimpton (Owen Wilson), appears to be the son that Zissou never knew he had, and Jane Winslett-Richardson (Cate Blanchett) is a journalist who is doing an article on Zissou and his quest.  Zissou is smitten with Jane, who takes a fancy to Ned.  Meanwhile Zissou's estranged wife, Eleanor (Angelica Huston), continues to be the brains behind Team Zissou, Klaus (Willem Dafoe) remains Zissou's right-hand man, Bill (Bud Cort) is along to count the money, and even rival Alistair Hennessey (Jeff Goldblum) lends assistance, even if he does not know about it until it is too late to say ""no.""Henry Selick (""The Nightmare Before Christmas"") does the animation for all of the underwater sea life in glowing pastel colors, and that aspect of the film helps to clue us into the wry surrealism of its humor.  The other big clue is that one of the crewmembers sings David Bowie songs in Portuguese.  Oh, and then there is the fact that the there are scenes taking place on a cutaway version of the ""Belafonte"" that would also be a clue. The problem is that there are patches where you think we are supposed to be taking things more seriously than we are, especially when the title character emerges from his lethargy to try and do something about all the down spiraling in his life.  Still, despite the steady sense of unease that afflicted me through most of the movie, I liked the ending of ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou,"" both in terms of the underwater climax and the on shore resolution.

632263,A2TBMX78M7PD5T,B00005JNLQ,"Malvolio ""scott15724""","[4, 5]","Synopsis: Steve Zissou, an underwater explorer and maker of documentaries, sets out on one last journey to hunt down the (possibly mythical) jaguar shark that killed his longtime friend and collaborator. The best years of his skill and popularity long behind him, his marriage on treacherous ground, Zissou takes fresh encouragement from the appearance of a young man, Ned Plimpton, who may be his son by an old lover. But he will need all the help he can get to make it through this quest - beset by debt, monitored by a hostile reporter and a bond company stooge, waylaid by pirates, and mocked by his own decrepit boat.I find that The Life Aquatic works a lot better for me if I don't think of it as a movie. A movie is usually, after all, something that belongs to a particular genre, has a fairly consistent tone, and eventually achieves the handful of manifest goals that it sets out to reach. At least, a good movie does those things; and while I'm not inclined to call this film bad, well, it just doesn't work that way. It's more like a large banquet, with a wildly improbable mix of edibles. Some of them are to your taste, some not; but after a nibble or two at the bad ones you can leave them on a discarded dish with no harm to your palette, and still enjoy the rest until you are full.The oddest taste at this feast is the film's eccentric mix of tones. Is it an action movie? There is some violence - gunplay with a band of pirates, blood in the water from a shark attack, kidnappings, a number of deaths (nearly all offscreen) - yet there's a wierdly tongue-in-cheek air to it all. And in the parts of the movie that take place underwater, instead of James Cameron realism we get a stylized, Barney-like fairyland replete with hummingbird fish and a rhinestone-studded jaguar shark.Is it a movie about relationships? There's much grist for that as well, yet very little appears resolved between the characters by the time the credits roll. Is it farce? Drama? It's impossible to say when both are present in equal measure.Something similar is going on with the sets. When characters move from one place to another in Zissou's boat (the Belafonte), or in the seaborne laboratory of Zissou's competitor, Hennessey, the camera doesn't follow them through the tight passages as it might in another movie. Rather, we view them from the side as they wind through a kind of cutaway set. It's hard to explain - you have to see it - and though it's kind of cool, it's hard to square with the more naturalistic style in other parts of the film. It's almost as if The Life Aquatic were half stage play and half movie.And then there are those touches that are just, well, pointless. Like the Team Zissou mate whose primary function appears to be singing and playing acoustic renditions of David Bowie songs. In French. Or the fact that all members of the team are supposed to wear red stocking caps and Glock pistols. Huh?The more toothsome aspects of The Life Aquatic are mostly related to the characters, and they are a rare combination of actors indeed. As the feature writer who tags along on Zissou's adventure, Cate Blanchette brings warmth and multi-dimensionality to a sketchily written role. Michael Gambon, as Zissou's benevolently unhelpful financial partner, inhabits that breezy sort of indolence on which British actors appear to have cornered the market. And the divine Anjelica Huston employs her cool disdain and formidable cheekbones to dazzling effect as Zissou's estranged wife, Eleanor.That is not to say that the movie is uniformly well-cast or well performed. The biggest disappointment is Owen Wilson as Zissou's maybe-son, Ned. In Wilson's defense, the part is not strongly written; its primary flavor is diffidence. Still, where a better actor might give the role a bit more texture, Wilson sticks to the generic kind of little-kid vulnerability that he's done before. Willem Dafoe is bizarrely cast as a German member of Team Zissou who jealously guards his place in the pecking order and resents the appearance of Ned. The performance is crudely rendered and tends to lurch a bit from one posture to the next.Finally there's Bill Murray. Like Mel Gibson a few years ago, Murray has recently gone on a bender of making films - including Lost In Translation and this year's Broken Flowers - whose primary subject is himself. Murray has been more successful at it than Gibson, though, because as well as we think we know him, he always manages to show us something subtly new. This time around, like the underwater explorer he plays, Murray guides us down successively through the layers of his previously-revealed characters - the cad, the slacker, the rule-breaker, the reconstructed jerk, and so on - finally revealing an ambivalent father, a timidly-appreciative husband ... and in the magical depths of the ocean, a wonder-struck child. It's his performance that ultimately tips the scale in favor of this very singular movie.",3,An Odd Banquet,1127779200,"09 27, 2005",2005,4960,"['Synopsis', 'Steve', 'Zissou', 'underwater', 'explorer', 'maker', 'documentaries', 'out', 'one', 'last', 'journey', 'hunt', 'down', 'possibly', 'mythical', 'jaguar', 'shark', 'killed', 'longtime', 'friend', 'collaborator', 'best', 'years', 'skill', 'popularity', 'long', 'marriage', 'treacherous', 'ground', 'Zissou', 'fresh', 'encouragement', 'appearance', 'young', 'man', 'Ned', 'Plimpton', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'son', 'old', 'lover', 'will', 'need', 'help', 'can', 'get', 'make', 'quest', 'beset', 'debt', 'monitored', 'hostile', 'reporter', 'bond', 'company', 'stooge', 'waylaid', 'pirates', 'mocked', 'own', 'decrepit', 'boat.I', 'find', 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'lot', 'better', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'movie', 'usually', 'something', 'particular', 'genre', 'fairly', 'consistent', 'tone', 'eventually', 'handful', 'manifest', 'goals', 'out', 'reach', 'least', 'good', 'movie', 'things', ""'m"", 'not', 'inclined', 'call', 'film', 'bad', 'well', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'way', 'more', 'large', 'banquet', 'wildly', 'improbable', 'mix', 'edibles', 'are', 'taste', 'not', 'nibble', 'two', 'bad', 'ones', 'can', 'leave', 'discarded', 'dish', 'harm', 'palette', 'still', 'enjoy', 'rest', 'are', 'full.The', 'oddest', 'taste', 'feast', 'film', 'eccentric', 'mix', 'tones', 'action', 'movie', 'violence', 'gunplay', 'band', 'pirates', 'blood', 'water', 'shark', 'attack', 'kidnappings', 'number', 'deaths', 'nearly', 'offscreen', 'yet', 'wierdly', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'air', 'parts', 'movie', 'take', 'place', 'underwater', 'instead', 'James', 'Cameron', 'realism', 'get', 'stylized', 'Barney-like', 'fairyland', 'replete', 'hummingbird', 'fish', 'rhinestone-studded', 'jaguar', 'shark.Is', 'movie', 'relationships', 'much', 'grist', 'as', 'well', 'yet', 'very', 'little', 'resolved', 'characters', 'time', 'credits', 'roll', 'farce', 'Drama', 'impossible', 'say', 'when', 'are', 'present', 'equal', 'measure.Something', 'similar', 'going', 'sets', 'When', 'characters', 'move', 'one', 'place', 'Zissou', 'boat', 'Belafonte', 'seaborne', 'laboratory', 'Zissou', 'competitor', 'Hennessey', 'camera', ""n't"", 'follow', 'tight', 'passages', 'might', 'movie', 'Rather', 'view', 'side', 'wind', 'kind', 'cutaway', 'set', 'hard', 'explain', 'have', 'see', 'kind', 'cool', 'hard', 'square', 'more', 'naturalistic', 'style', 'other', 'parts', 'film', 'almost', 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'were', 'half', 'stage', 'play', 'half', 'movie.And', 'then', 'are', 'touches', 'are', 'just', 'well', 'pointless', 'Team', 'Zissou', 'mate', 'primary', 'function', 'be', 'singing', 'playing', 'acoustic', 'renditions', 'David', 'Bowie', 'songs', 'French', 'fact', 'members', 'team', 'are', 'supposed', 'wear', 'red', 'stocking', 'caps', 'Glock', 'pistols', 'Huh', 'more', 'toothsome', 'aspects', 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'are', 'mostly', 'related', 'characters', 'are', 'rare', 'combination', 'actors', 'indeed', 'feature', 'writer', 'who', 'along', 'Zissou', 'adventure', 'Cate', 'Blanchette', 'warmth', 'multi-dimensionality', 'sketchily', 'written', 'role', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'Zissou', 'benevolently', 'unhelpful', 'financial', 'partner', 'breezy', 'sort', 'indolence', 'British', 'actors', 'appear', 'have', 'cornered', 'market', 'divine', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 'cool', 'disdain', 'formidable', 'cheekbones', 'dazzling', 'effect', 'Zissou', 'estranged', 'wife', 'Eleanor.That', 'not', 'say', 'movie', 'uniformly', 'well-cast', 'well', 'performed', 'biggest', 'disappointment', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Zissou', 'maybe-son', 'Ned', 'Wilson', 'defense', 'part', 'not', 'strongly', 'written', 'primary', 'flavor', 'diffidence', 'Still', 'where', 'better', 'actor', 'might', 'give', 'role', 'bit', 'more', 'texture', 'Wilson', 'generic', 'kind', 'little-kid', 'vulnerability', 'done', 'before', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'bizarrely', 'cast', 'German', 'member', 'Team', 'Zissou', 'who', 'jealously', 'place', 'pecking', 'order', 'appearance', 'Ned', 'performance', 'crudely', 'rendered', 'lurch', 'bit', 'one', 'posture', 'next.Finally', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'Murray', 'recently', 'gone', 'bender', 'making', 'films', 'including', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'year', 'Broken', 'Flowers', 'primary', 'subject', 'Murray', 'been', 'more', 'successful', 'Gibson', 'though', 'as', 'well', 'think', 'know', 'always', 'show', 'something', 'subtly', 'new', 'time', 'around', 'underwater', 'explorer', 'Murray', 'down', 'successively', 'layers', 'previously-revealed', 'characters', 'cad', 'slacker', 'rule-breaker', 'reconstructed', 'jerk', 'so', 'finally', 'revealing', 'ambivalent', 'father', 'timidly-appreciative', 'husband', 'magical', 'depths', 'ocean', 'wonder-struck', 'child', 'performance', 'ultimately', 'scale', 'favor', 'very', 'singular', 'movie']",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

The overall storyline was so absurd that I couldn't help but be interested by it.  Bill Murray was ok in this movie, but I think that the roles played by Owen Wilson (as Murray's son Ned) and Wilem Defoe (as Klaus) were better.  I was particular suprized and pleased with Defoe's role as Klaus.  Before I was only familar with Defoe for his vilanous role as Norman Osborne (Green Goblin) in Spiderman and for the role of the gruff, cross-dressing cop in Boondock Saints.  It was nice to see him play a convincing comic role.  I liked Wilson's role too but I can't see anything particularly special about, and liked Cate Blanchett's role as well.  Jeff Goldbum's character was not very original; he played an esentric, geeky scientist just like he played in Jurassic Park or Independence Day.I guess that the main problem that I had with this movie was that there was just too much Bill Murrary in it.  Don't get me wrong, Murray easily held his own in many movies in his earlier career, but in this one I just got tired of him and his character.  The part of the movie that I hated was what happened to Owen Wilson's character.  I don't think it served any good purpose in the movie and seemed really out of place.  The only thing that it made me think was that this movie was really only about Murray and that the other characters were not important and were also not well developed.  After this point, the movie just drags on until it finishes.I found this movie mostly enjoyable but was vey disappointed by the end.

He's kind of like Christopher Guest (""Waiting for Guffman"", ""Best in Show""), where the viewer really has to ""get"" the joke.  The difference is, even when you do ""get the joke"" with Anderson, you still may not be belly laughing.Unlike Guest, Anderson isn't throwing out a bunch of one liners that you have to catch; but like Guest, you have to pay attention.  In ""Life Aquatic"", Anderson creates an incredibly complex world that is slightly off from reality.  I don't think I laughed out loud once during the entire movie, yet I was smiling and chuckling to myself the entire time.  I thoroughly enjoyed the film, and can't wait to watch it again.""The Life Aquatic"" is basically about a once respected underwater nature documentarian, Steve Zissou (Bill Murray), who is feeling his age and lack of relevance.  He tries to revitalize himself by trying gain a connection a young man (Owen Wilson) who may, or may not, be his son.There are so many things that I love about this film.  The cast is impeccable.  Bill Murray and Angelica Huston are amazing.  Owen Wilson, for once, didn't annoy me.  Willem Dafoe practically steals the show in a wonderfully uncharacteristic performance.Really, the thing I love about this movie is that atmosphere.  It is on the verge of being a drama, and yet it's so silly.  There is a wonderful soundtrack of David Bowie sung in Portuguese by a Brazilian troubadour, played by Seu Jorge.  He is ubiquitous through the film, and is making subtle comments on the scenes, like a Greek chorus.  Jorge is backed up by a wonderful score written by Devo's Mark Mothersbaugh.  Other great additions to the film are the bizarre stop motion underwater creatures created by Henry Selick, the director of ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"".  The stop motion looked so unique, that I thought it was computer graphics!

This movie got very little press in the US and very little distribution, but it is not dismissable. It is tender, moving and is more about man than the sea presented in blazing color and images, live and animated.It is a mockumentary on the Zissou team that begins at the premiere of a recent documentary that ends with the death of Zissou's longtime partner in the jaws of a yet undocumented shark.  Contrary to most aquatic preservationists' creedos, at the post press breifing Zissou (Murphy) announces he will find the creature, but instead of cataloging and studying it for posterity, will kill it. At the post screening party he meets Ned (Owens) who he has heard over the years is his son, for the first time.  As the story ensues, it is a flighty, human examination of relationships, careers, personalities and the interconnection they play in our day to day lives.The colors are vivid and rich with stop action animation that utilizes different materials for texture and motion. The soundtrack is a hoot featuring Brazilian pop artist that does renditions of 10 David Bowie hits. It's combined with very rudimentary techno music that sounds like the computer music or little keyboards from the 70's and 80's. Then there are simple recurring themes that pull the movie along emotionally.This is italian flavored cinema in a fun and goofy way.Metaldiva Sez:  Life Aquatic is visually and emotionally mesmerizing and held the attention of my entire family, Grandma, Grandpa, Dad, Mom, teenager and 6 year old alike.

I think it is this that has buoyed this particular movie's status.  Wes Anderson's LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU has so many misfires it's a wonder it ever sailed at all.  While the script has some clever lines and it's premise is somewhat intriguing, the execution of the film is so lame I found myself wondering when it would end.  Bill Murray as Steve Zissou gives one of those patented Murray performances, trying hard to be taken seriously as an actor, yet maintaining some of the persona that made him famous in the first place.  Murray doesn't seem all that inspired in his performance, and even in some of his better scenes with Owen Wilson and Anjelica Huston, they aren't enough to salvage his performance.  Wilson and Huston on the other hand make the best of their material and are actually effective in the roles of Murray's supposed son and his business savvy wife.  Willem Dafoe has one of his strangest roles as Murray's long suffering mate; Jeff Goldblum is erratic as Murray's oceanographic rival; Cate Blanchett being the marvelous actress she is even makes the pregnant journalist convincing.  The attempt to Portuguesize David Bowie's music is commendable, but I found most of the music intrusive and unimportant.  Director Anderson and his film crew do serve up some beautiful underworld fantasy images and the arrival of the Jaguar Shark is certainly photogenic.

The humor is very offbeat, and I can understand why many people don't enjoy this film at all.  In a way, the film's humor is much like the Yankees baseball team; you either love it or hate it.  There's really not a lot of side-splitting, howling out loud type of laughs in the film.  What you do get is an ongoing queue of humorous events and characters.  I had a grin on my face throughout the entire film.If you like Bill Murray, you'll probably like this film.  If you like Owen Wilson, I'd say your chances of liking the film are about 50-50, since this is not the typical Owen Wilson role.  Most will enjoy the other stars in the film, all of which add something to make the film unique.There is a somewhat serious side to the film, which considers the life of a formerly successful man who has to come to terms with recent failures, direction of his remaining years, and the struggle to connect with those he loves.

Very original writing, very retro-schlock 70-80's coloring, set design, costume & animation. Even the documentary music has that 80's techno Kitt-the-car midi-computer music.Similar dryness as Waiting for Guffman, Best in Show, Royal Tenenbaums and Pecker.If you were wanting something easy--backoff and rent: Ghostbusters, Caddyshack, American Pie or Dukes of Hazard.Anyway, Zissou (Murray) is a world famous naturalist filmmaker--yet oddly, he and all of his crew seem to have no credentials or interests in nature or animals.  His career is slipping, his arch-rival filmmaker Hennessey (Goldblum) is always grabbing up all the grant money & flirting with Zissou's wife, Eleanor (Houston).  Zissou needs her brains and family's money to stay in business, and she and her family have cut him off.His latest film bombs publicly at the screening.  He vows mortal vengeance on a never-seen-before-species of shark that killed his pal--shocking their nature-loving fans.  In the nick of time, Zissou's new-found ""son"" Ned (Wilson) shows up with a big inheritance!  Poof!  Zissou renames him ""Kingsley (Ned) Zissou"" with new stationary, & stuffs him in the team uniform of a pistol, speedo & red knit cap.  Even the Indian guy has a red-turban. Off they go in their rust-bucket of a scientific-research boat with much news video of the giant safe with Ned's Cash $$ they are taking.The crew is very quirky & odd. Defoe steals the show with his ultra-needy, jealous, heartbroken, wannabe ""son"".  The college geeks are carrying computers in almost every scene.  Floating around, there's the kooky Brazilian covering David Bowie songs in Portuguese, and the topless nagging girl.  The pregnant journalist (Blanchett) shows up, officially to do a nice-story on Zissou, but keeps slipping clues that it might be a brutal expose'. Ned falls for her, but is ultra-gentlemanly enough to give her space to work out her issues.  Zissou & Ned develop a rivalry for her, threatening their developing father-son relationship.Pirates attack, looking suspiciously familiar, like the Filipino cooking staff of possibly Hennessey's boat--who were watching the news video. (Modern Pirate attacks: 360 attacks in 2002)  Zissou ""steals"" their 3-legged dog as revenge.Zissou's crew robs Hennessey's research station and steal his equipment, mainly the espresso machine, they didn't know what the rest of it was.They are forced to beg for help from Eleanor & her family, interrupting her session with a 20-year-old male model.  While visiting her family estate, they find nearby the pirates & a kidnapped Hennessey & bond agent.  Zissou flips out and saves the day with a crazed, suicidal charge.A sad event demoralizes the crew & slaps in Zissou's face  his many spurned chances to be a father.Suddenly, there is that magical chance to chase and connect with the symbolic unicorn again, and all are enthralled with the magic of the experience in a way they've probably never experienced in all their decades of being fake naturalists.Note: watch the outtakes of Dafoe & Ahluwalia drinking Mai Tai's, what an image.",5,"Mock Documentary, dry, subtle, sarcastic, spoofish, sweet",1124755200,"08 23, 2005",2005,3196,"['Spoofish', 'Mock', 'Documentary', 'based', 'Jacques', 'Cousteau', 'documentaries', 'very', 'dry', 'sarcastic', 'yet', 'sweet-natured', 'Very', 'original', 'writing', 'very', 'retro-schlock', '70-80', 'coloring', 'set', 'design', 'costume', 'animation', 'Even', 'documentary', 'music', '80', 'techno', 'Kitt-the-car', 'midi-computer', 'music.Similar', 'dryness', 'Waiting', 'Guffman', 'Best', 'Show', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'Pecker.If', 'were', 'wanting', 'something', 'easy', 'backoff', 'rent', 'Ghostbusters', 'Caddyshack', 'American', 'Pie', 'Dukes', 'Hazard.Anyway', 'Zissou', 'Murray', 'world', 'famous', 'naturalist', 'filmmaker', 'yet', 'oddly', 'crew', 'seem', 'have', 'credentials', 'interests', 'nature', 'animals', 'career', 'slipping', 'arch-rival', 'filmmaker', 'Hennessey', 'Goldblum', 'always', 'grabbing', 'up', 'grant', 'money', 'flirting', 'Zissou', 'wife', 'Eleanor', 'Houston', 'Zissou', 'brains', 'family', 'money', 'stay', 'business', 'family', 'have', 'cut', 'off.His', 'latest', 'film', 'bombs', 'publicly', 'screening', 'mortal', 'vengeance', 'never-seen-before-species', 'shark', 'killed', 'pal', 'shocking', 'nature-loving', 'fans', 'nick', 'time', 'Zissou', 'new-found', 'son', 'Ned', 'Wilson', 'up', 'big', 'inheritance', 'Poof', 'Zissou', 'Kingsley', 'Ned', 'Zissou', 'new', 'stationary', 'stuffs', 'team', 'uniform', 'pistol', 'speedo', 'red', 'knit', 'cap', 'Even', 'Indian', 'guy', 'red-turban', 'go', 'rust-bucket', 'scientific-research', 'boat', 'much', 'news', 'video', 'giant', 'safe', 'Ned', 'Cash', 'are', 'taking.The', 'crew', 'very', 'quirky', 'odd', 'Defoe', 'show', 'ultra-needy', 'jealous', 'heartbroken', 'wannabe', 'son', 'college', 'geeks', 'are', 'carrying', 'computers', 'almost', 'scene', 'Floating', 'around', 'kooky', 'Brazilian', 'covering', 'David', 'Bowie', 'songs', 'Portuguese', 'topless', 'nagging', 'girl', 'pregnant', 'journalist', 'Blanchett', 'up', 'officially', 'do', 'nice-story', 'Zissou', 'slipping', 'clues', 'might', 'be', 'brutal', 'expose', 'Ned', 'ultra-gentlemanly', 'enough', 'give', 'space', 'work', 'out', 'issues', 'Zissou', 'Ned', 'develop', 'rivalry', 'threatening', 'developing', 'father-son', 'relationship.Pirates', 'attack', 'looking', 'suspiciously', 'familiar', 'Filipino', 'cooking', 'staff', 'possibly', 'Hennessey', 'boat', 'who', 'were', 'watching', 'news', 'video', 'Modern', 'Pirate', 'attacks', '360', 'attacks', '2002', 'Zissou', 'steals', '3-legged', 'dog', 'revenge.Zissou', 'crew', 'Hennessey', 'research', 'station', 'steal', 'equipment', 'mainly', 'espresso', 'machine', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'rest', 'are', 'forced', 'beg', 'help', 'Eleanor', 'family', 'interrupting', 'session', '20-year-old', 'male', 'model', 'visiting', 'family', 'estate', 'find', 'nearby', 'pirates', 'kidnapped', 'Hennessey', 'bond', 'agent', 'Zissou', 'out', 'day', 'crazed', 'suicidal', 'charge.A', 'sad', 'event', 'crew', 'slaps', 'Zissou', 'face', 'many', 'spurned', 'chances', 'be', 'father.Suddenly', 'magical', 'chance', 'chase', 'connect', 'symbolic', 'unicorn', 'again', 'are', 'enthralled', 'magic', 'experience', 'way', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'never', 'experienced', 'decades', 'being', 'fake', 'naturalists.Note', 'watch', 'outtakes', 'Dafoe', 'Ahluwalia', 'drinking', 'Mai', 'Tai', 'what', 'image']",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

There is a very nice feel to it: mellow, easy and cool, even when the action is on. This feel is perhaps captured best in the remarkably enjoyable Brazilian covers of classic David Bowie songs.One thing worth noting about this film, beyond the ""quirky"" stylings that you expect from Wes Anderson (and that don't always come off, to my mind, as I just couldn't get in to The Royal Tenenbaums much as I wanted), is the way the film plays with and responds to the popularity of the ""nature documentary,"" especially those of Jacques Cousteau. In the nature documentary, we feel as though we are getting ""closer"" to nature. We believe that we are getting at something real. What we tend to forget or be unaware of, is how much mediation is involved in the presentation of nature. The nature we see on film is never nature ""as it is"" but nature as it has been framed and captured in accordance with certain expectations of what will sell, what values will play to a wide audience.It should also be remembered that this is a Disney film, and Wes Anderson appears to be very self-conscious of the fact that a large part of Disney's name and popularity was established through Disney wildlife films. Walt Disney himself once remarked that he saw his live action wildlife films to be merely an extension of his animations -- because he knew how much the editor and filmmaker are involved in showing what you want to show. What they did show was not Darwin's ""nature red tooth and claw"" but a sanitized nature, where danger was always contained, and family values were reinforced by the behaviors of animals: a mother and her pups, for example.That, it seems to me, helps explain the fact that Wes Anderson chose not to employ ""real"" underwater animals but chose stop motion animation as his medium. It reminds us that nature appears on screen always mediated, through a ""nature hero"" (as Zissou once was) and through a set of decisions about what to include, how to edit it, what to value.Anyhow, I could go on and on about what I liked and thought about this film, but I can say that I didn't expect to like this film but found myself surprised feeling very nice (and a bit odd, not sure what to think) about half way through and leaving with a smile and a hint of sadness as I walked the theater.

632303,AKIC8WLE6UNL0,B00005JNLQ,perechaha,"[7, 12]","In ""The Life Aquatic"" Steve Zissou (Bill Murray), a colorful caricature of Jacques Cousteau, learns that he has a son (Owen Wilson) from a former lover, is left by his wife (Angelica Huston) and spends most of the movie looking for a giant shark that ate his partner.Very cute at times but for the most part boring and somewhat pretentious.  That's how I described ""The Life Aquatic"" to a friend of mine.  After she saw the movie herself, she said that I was way too kind to it in my recommendation.  Sadly enough Wes Anderson has reached a point in his career (I hope it's just a phase) where he has no new ideas and his style (imagine French New Wave but filmed in luscious colors and taken to a cartoonish extreme) comes off as heavy-handed  and irritating.  Clearly, Anderson is trying to accomplish the same thing he did with ""The Royal Tenembaums"", by looking at human relationships under a magnifying glass through his use of outlandish, bigger than life characters.  I'm down with that.  However, everything he's trying to do with this movie, he already accomplished (infinitely more gracefully) in ""The Royal Tenembaums"".  There are many nice touches to this movie but all of them are superficial - beautiful sets, quirky costumes, absurd sea animal special effects (and even pirates!).  There is enough playful weirdness to keep the audience half awake, sometimes even giggling with delight (every time a new bizarre sea creature is introduced).  But for someone like Wes Anderson who clearly fancies himself a serious auteur, there is hardly any substance.  I grew up watching Jacques Cousteau so that whole angle made the movie more bearable.  But after a while this same aspect of the film becomes kind of pathetic - it's like watching a standup comedian whose whole routine is hanging by one good joke.  And what's with all the homophobic slurs scattered throughout the movie?  Is it supposed to be funny when someone uses a lesbian slur over and over again?  I wonder if Wes Anderson would find it acceptable to have his white protagonists constantly use the `n' word as a side gag.Anyway, the big question is what is this contrived sorry movie doing in Criterion Collection?",2,Disappointing,1151020800,"06 23, 2006",2006,2190,"['Life', 'Aquatic', 'Steve', 'Zissou', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'colorful', 'caricature', 'Jacques', 'Cousteau', 'son', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'former', 'lover', 'left', 'wife', 'Angelica', 'Huston', 'most', 'movie', 'looking', 'giant', 'shark', 'ate', 'partner.Very', 'cute', 'times', 'most', 'part', 'boring', 'somewhat', 'pretentious', 'how', 'described', 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'friend', 'mine', 'saw', 'movie', 'herself', 'said', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'kind', 'recommendation', 'Sadly', 'enough', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'reached', 'point', 'career', 'hope', 'just', 'phase', 'where', 'new', 'ideas', 'style', 'imagine', 'French', 'New', 'Wave', 'filmed', 'luscious', 'colors', 'taken', 'cartoonish', 'extreme', 'off', 'heavy-handed', 'irritating', 'Clearly', 'Anderson', 'trying', 'accomplish', 'same', 'thing', 'did', 'Royal', 'Tenembaums', 'looking', 'human', 'relationships', 'magnifying', 'glass', 'use', 'outlandish', 'bigger', 'life', 'characters', ""'m"", 'down', 'However', 'everything', 'trying', 'do', 'movie', 'already', 'accomplished', 'infinitely', 'more', 'gracefully', 'Royal', 'Tenembaums', 'are', 'many', 'nice', 'touches', 'movie', 'are', 'superficial', 'beautiful', 'sets', 'quirky', 'costumes', 'absurd', 'sea', 'animal', 'special', 'effects', 'even', 'pirates', 'enough', 'playful', 'weirdness', 'keep', 'audience', 'half', 'awake', 'sometimes', 'even', 'giggling', 'delight', 'time', 'new', 'bizarre', 'sea', 'creature', 'introduced', 'someone', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'who', 'clearly', 'serious', 'auteur', 'hardly', 'substance', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'Jacques', 'Cousteau', 'whole', 'angle', 'made', 'movie', 'more', 'bearable', 'while', 'same', 'aspect', 'film', 'kind', 'pathetic', 'watching', 'standup', 'comedian', 'whole', 'routine', 'hanging', 'one', 'good', 'joke', 'what', 'homophobic', 'slurs', 'scattered', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'when', 'someone', 'lesbian', 'slur', 'over', 'again', 'wonder', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'would', 'find', 'acceptable', 'have', 'white', 'protagonists', 'constantly', 'use', 'n', 'word', 'side', 'gag.Anyway', 'big', 'question', 'what', 'contrived', 'sorry', 'movie', 'doing', 'Criterion', 'Collection']",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

Bill Murray delivers a delightfully deadpan performance, as do members of an awesome supporting cast including Owen Wilson, in a major role as the possible son of the past-his-prime Jaques Cousteau knock-off Steve Zissou, played by Murray.  More subtle in their performances are Willem Dafoe, Angelica Huston, Kate Blanchett, Jeff Goldblum, and others.Writer/Director/Producer Wes Anderson has a lot going on in the film, much concealed somehow by the seemingly slow pace, and the deadpan deliveries of the cast, who never once lapse into camp.  The pseudo-documentary sequences look delightfully phoney in every way, and the use of an obvious ship cut-away mock-up is no more explained than camera shots of the cameraman, the students from ""North Alaska University,"" or the plot migrating from Italy to Africa to the Philippines in an eyeblink.Many crictics just didn't pick up on much of this wit, nor the name puns (calling the ship the Belafonte and the harbor Port-au-Patois for instance).  The slow pacing may make the mind wander, and then much of the nuance is lost.For these reasons, those who enjoy the film will want to own the DVD and watch it several times to catch all that is going on.If you are hooked on action films, special effects, or even cheap sight gags and snotty dialogue, this film isn't for you.

632311,A2L7WYA5OENV03,B00005JNLQ,Reticuli,"[6, 8]","A lot of people had problems with this film.  They believe Wes Anderson just didn't achieve what was (or should have been) intended in this one compared to his previous projects.  I think he's gotten back to the heart that was in his first full length, Bottle Rocket.  In that one, it focused on the preoccupation of juvenile adult males, some not totally with all their marbles and none of them really much more than slackers, on having a gang/team/crew and having adventures.  In Rushmore, I think it's more along the line of someone trying to make do without a crew, but finally finding themselves in the end (amongst many other things...or maybe it's not even part of this Crew Trilogy).  In Tenenbaums, it seems like your relatives/family becoming (perhaps by default) a sort of crew, and how you deal with that.  In Aquatic, it's your crew (literally) becoming your family.  There's so much intricacy of universal human interaction, as well as the unique quirks (like the refreshing strangeness of all their honesty and emotional openness...maybe the salt air?) of the characters and their ""aquatic documentary culture"", contained in this film.  Then there's those Wes Anderson signature mid-wide angle lenses and all the dead-pan symmetry.  I noticed a great deal of fit, finish, and detail to the dialog, front and background.

632312,A2TBWLOHTZNK54,B00005JNLQ,Reviewer,"[2, 4]","People seem to talk a whole lot about Wes Anderson and the intellectual quality of his movies, which is a line of babble I don't really follow. I know I DO enjoy quirky comedy, and Bill Murray as well as a lot of the other cast seemed like they could pull something out of this crazy plot.In my opinion, they do and then some. Zissou might not be entirely formulaic movie making, but it's not really the art/fringe film some might suggest. It's funny because it's always treading near the realm of nonsense, but there's still a strong plot (which is actually Zissou's relationships with his supposed son, his wife, his crew, and the world that once gave him a career and now has deserted him, not the more outlandish revenge against a shark.) Despite a slightly confusing ending that asks the age old tirade, ""why did they do that at the last minute to character X to make the end more dramatic"" it is a fairly warm and engaging tale of a very dysfunctional lot of mavericks that nontheless somehow find expertise through their combined strengths.The humor is like if the satiricalness of Office Space and the fast paced dysfunction of Arrested Development mellowed out and smoked a joint, to tell the life of a much crazier Jack Cousteau and his crew.

632313,A3W13VVBRY5GL7,B00005JNLQ,"Review Lover ""ReviewLover""","[0, 1]","And the award for Weirdest Movie of the Millennium thus far goes to The Life Aquatic!Wes Anderson once more takes us on a satisfyingly trippy, nicely bittersweet and beautifully-directed journey right into the heart of experimental mainstream cinema, and, while this movie isn't as tight or together as The Royal Tennenbaums, it's still very rewarding and very worthwhile.The plot: Steve Zissou is an oceanic documentary maker in the mould of Jaques Cousteau, who is down on his luck in more ways than one. His company's going broke, his marriage to the enigmatic Elanor (Anjelica Huston in perfect casting, once more) is on the rocks and his nemesis, the oddly fey Alistair Hennessey (Jeff Goldblum, in a great and sympathetic comic role), is lapping his failures up. Most pressingly, his business partner and friend Esteban has been gobbled up by an unknown variety of sea beast, and Zissou's quest for revenge is the premise of the movie. Along the way he acquires an unknown son Ned (Owen Wilson) and a ballsy reporter Jane (Cate Blanchett) as unlikely shipmates, and the movie goes from there.Performance-wise, while nobody in particular stands out, everyone is excellent, and Murray and Huston have a great onscreen chemistry as a waspish couple. Willem DeFoe is wonderful as the teutonic first mate and Cate Blanchett is a joy to watch as the tough-yet-tender Jane. The performances are predictable and standard Anderson fare, but excellent and multi-layered nonetheless.Direction's similarly excellent, the use of colour and whimsical child-like sets and animations are both original and appealing. There's a real sense of life to the visuals, and to give Anderson credit, his seemingly low-budget special effects work extremely well, given the context of the characterisation and premise. Sure, the story is slow-moving (even a little too long?), but when there's such a quirky feast for the senses on offer, it doesn't matter. Dramatic action-comedy romances are hard to come by, but when talent like this sits both behind and before the camera, they're a real treat for viewers who like a little challenge with their entertainment.Highly recommended.",4,"Over-long, but well worth the ride",1127174400,"09 20, 2005",2005,2161,"['award', 'Weirdest', 'Movie', 'Millennium', 'thus', 'far', 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'once', 'more', 'satisfyingly', 'trippy', 'nicely', 'bittersweet', 'beautifully-directed', 'journey', 'right', 'heart', 'experimental', 'mainstream', 'cinema', 'movie', ""n't"", 'as', 'tight', 'together', 'Royal', 'Tennenbaums', 'still', 'very', 'rewarding', 'very', 'worthwhile.The', 'plot', 'Steve', 'Zissou', 'oceanic', 'documentary', 'maker', 'mould', 'Jaques', 'Cousteau', 'who', 'down', 'luck', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'company', 'going', 'broke', 'marriage', 'enigmatic', 'Elanor', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 'perfect', 'casting', 'once', 'more', 'rocks', 'nemesis', 'oddly', 'fey', 'Alistair', 'Hennessey', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'great', 'sympathetic', 'comic', 'role', 'lapping', 'failures', 'up', 'Most', 'pressingly', 'business', 'partner', 'friend', 'Esteban', 'been', 'gobbled', 'up', 'unknown', 'variety', 'sea', 'beast', 'Zissou', 'quest', 'revenge', 'premise', 'movie', 'way', 'unknown', 'son', 'Ned', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'ballsy', 'reporter', 'Jane', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'unlikely', 'shipmates', 'movie', 'there.Performance-wise', 'nobody', 'particular', 'stands', 'out', 'everyone', 'excellent', 'Murray', 'Huston', 'have', 'great', 'onscreen', 'chemistry', 'waspish', 'couple', 'Willem', 'DeFoe', 'wonderful', 'teutonic', 'first', 'mate', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'joy', 'watch', 'tough-yet-tender', 'Jane', 'performances', 'are', 'predictable', 'standard', 'Anderson', 'fare', 'excellent', 'multi-layered', 'nonetheless.Direction', 'similarly', 'excellent', 'use', 'colour', 'whimsical', 'child-like', 'sets', 'animations', 'are', 'original', 'appealing', 'real', 'sense', 'life', 'visuals', 'give', 'Anderson', 'credit', 'seemingly', 'low-budget', 'special', 'effects', 'work', 'extremely', 'well', 'given', 'context', 'characterisation', 'premise', 'Sure', 'story', 'slow-moving', 'even', 'little', 'too', 'long', 'when', 'such', 'quirky', 'feast', 'senses', 'offer', ""n't"", 'matter', 'Dramatic', 'action-comedy', 'romances', 'are', 'hard', 'come', 'when', 'talent', 'camera', ""'re"", 'real', 'treat', 'viewers', 'who', 'little', 'challenge', 'entertainment.Highly', 'recommended']",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

632317,A3BJDFGSLXFB36,B00005JNLQ,R. Legendre,"[1, 1]","I recently watched this film for the second time (I first saw it when it was initially released on DVD) and I enjoyed it more the second time than I did the first.The movie has an almost surreal, dream-like quality about it. Many of the sea creatures are stop-motion animated rather than CGI which sort of lends a tongue-in-cheek quality to the whole experience. The music (mostly David Bowie songs, but also a ""score"" that sounds like it was composed and performed on a $20.00 Casio keyboard - another quirky touch courtesy of Mark Mothersbaugh of ""Devo"" fame) doesn't really seem to fit into the context of the film, but somehow it just WORKS.There are many pop (and not so ""pop"") cultural references and gags throughout the film, but you must keep a sharp eye and ear open for many of them (""Not this one, Klaus"" is a phrase that is obviously an homage to Francois Trauffaut's ""Jules and Jim"" - cute.)I wouldn't say the film is laugh-out-loud funny, but there are many humorous turns of phrase and a few scenes of physical comedy than put a smile on your face. Bill Murray's deadpan delivery of his lines in fiendish. Zissou is a jerk, but you can't help but love him.The set for Zissou's boat, the ""Bellefonte"" (another pop reference to Cousteau's own boat, the ""Calypso"") is obviously just that; a set. You can see how the actors are walking through doors to get from one room to the next depite the obvious fact that there are no walls on one side of all of the rooms. Another great ""surreal"" touch.This movie may not be for everyone due to it's intense quirkiness, but I found it to be very original and a refreshing change of pace from the usual trash Hollywood likes to dish out on a regualr basis.And, by the way, if Jacques-Yves Cousteau had been alive to see this film, I think he would have found it delightful and been honored by the tribute to him that this film obviously is.Please give this film a try, but keep an open mind.",4,Quirky and irresistable,1207094400,"04 2, 2008",2008,1942,"['recently', 'watched', 'film', 'second', 'time', 'first', 'saw', 'when', 'was', 'initially', 'released', 'DVD', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'second', 'time', 'did', 'first.The', 'movie', 'almost', 'surreal', 'dream-like', 'quality', 'Many', 'sea', 'creatures', 'are', 'stop-motion', 'rather', 'CGI', 'sort', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'quality', 'whole', 'experience', 'music', 'mostly', 'David', 'Bowie', 'songs', 'also', 'score', 'was', 'composed', 'performed', '20.00', 'Casio', 'keyboard', 'quirky', 'touch', 'courtesy', 'Mark', 'Mothersbaugh', 'Devo', 'fame', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'fit', 'context', 'film', 'somehow', 'just', 'WORKS.There', 'are', 'many', 'pop', 'not', 'so', 'pop', 'cultural', 'references', 'gags', 'film', 'must', 'keep', 'sharp', 'eye', 'ear', 'open', 'many', 'Not', 'one', 'Klaus', 'phrase', 'obviously', 'homage', 'Francois', 'Trauffaut', 'Jules', 'Jim', 'cute', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'film', 'laugh-out-loud', 'funny', 'are', 'many', 'humorous', 'turns', 'phrase', 'few', 'scenes', 'physical', 'comedy', 'put', 'smile', 'face', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'deadpan', 'delivery', 'lines', 'fiendish', 'Zissou', 'jerk', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'love', 'him.The', 'set', 'Zissou', 'boat', 'Bellefonte', 'pop', 'reference', 'Cousteau', 'own', 'boat', 'Calypso', 'obviously', 'just', 'set', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'actors', 'are', 'walking', 'doors', 'get', 'one', 'room', 'next', 'depite', 'obvious', 'fact', 'are', 'walls', 'one', 'side', 'rooms', 'great', 'surreal', 'touch.This', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'due', 'intense', 'quirkiness', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'original', 'refreshing', 'change', 'pace', 'usual', 'trash', 'Hollywood', 'dish', 'out', 'regualr', 'basis.And', 'way', 'Jacques-Yves', 'Cousteau', 'had', 'been', 'alive', 'see', 'film', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'found', 'delightful', 'been', 'honored', 'tribute', 'film', 'obviously', 'is.Please', 'give', 'film', 'try', 'keep', 'open', 'mind']",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

Zwick,"[7, 13]","**1/2""Quirky"" doesn't even begin to describe ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou,"" a bizarre, completely off-the-wall comedy featuring a lead character who is a cross between Jacques Cousteau and Captain Ahab.  Steve Zissou (Bill Murray) is a world famous oceanographer and showman who has made a number of successful nature documentaries aboard his ship, The Belafonte.  However, in his last filmmaking venture, tragedy struck when his most venerable crew member was devoured by what Zissou describes as a ""jaguar shark.""  For the ""sequel"" to that film, Zissou sets off on a search for the killer of his friend, taking along with him a hostile woman reporter (Cate Blanchett) who is doing a magazine piece on his endeavor, a young man who claims to be his illegitimate son (Owen Wilson), and his usual assortment of crewmembers (including Willem DaFoe), cameramen and unpaid student interns.Although there are a number of very witty moments in this film and some of the acting is absolutely on the money, ""The Life Aquatic"" runs out of steam fairly early on, unable to find the buying-in point that would actually make us care about either the story or the characters.  Writer/director Wes Anderson and co-scenarist Noah Baumbach maintain the tone of understated eccentricity fairly well, but the material just isn't rich or varied enough to sustain a near-two hour running time.Murray once again proves himself the master of the deadpan delivery and the dry retort, while Blanchett, Dafoe, Angelica Houston and Jeff Goldblum offer superb support.

632328,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B00005JNLQ,Samuel McKewon,"[1, 7]","It seems like jealousy to put Wes Anderson on the rack for being too inventive with ""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou."" Anderson, in a short career of ten years and four films, has used his bookish, geeky, bittersweet humor to populate worlds that, until this movie, we wouldn't mind living in, especially the New York in ""The Royal Tenenbaums,"" a New York that probably existed for about two seconds in the 1970s, on the best date you ever had, at golden, chilly autumn dusk, when all the ego and pomp of the Me Generation took a night off, and even the cruel were hilarious.Just how Anderson orchestrated the tone of that film is a minor miracle, and he's aiming for another one in ""The Life Aquatic"" and he pretty much fails, though not completely, and not in a boring way. It'd be an insult to ""Tenenbaums"" to really assert this movie works, because it's all over the place, injecting equal parts whimsy and regret into the narrative and main character Steve Zissou, played by Bill Murray. Murray has become a distinct presence in film, a mercurial genius of sorts who left behind the antics when he played Polonius in the Ethan Hawke version of ""Hamlet"" and seems to have carried that presence of lonely wisdom ever since.Zissou is a marine biologist/documentarian, and, judging by his latest effort played in front of a packed house in Rome, one of diminishing skills. To watch the documentary, he actually has no skills - Anderson makes no effort toward realism. But in Wes World Zissou used to be good, and having lost his friend on the previous voyage to the mysterious and giant Jaguar Shark, there is again motivation in the his life, a part two where he finds the shark, kills it and films the struggle.Two problems emerge: Nobody wants to fund it; and his wife, the brains of the operation, wants no part of the return voyage. A third complication: A Kentucky pilot named Ned (Owen Wilson) appears in Rome claiming he *might* be Steve's son. Steve has heard of Ned - as the movie progresses we begin to learn just how long he has known about him - and he invites Ned on the voyage to find the shark. It helps that Ned has some money to fund the voyage.What follows is a topsy-turvy, strangely beautiful journey on this ship that includes a pregnant reporter (Cate Blanchett), Filipino pirates, a rescue mission in a rundown hotel and an unexpected death. Anderson is a wonderful filmmaker, able to compose scenes with an incredible amount of visual and informational depth. He's from the Stanley Kubrick school of cinematography - the frame is filled end to end with action and intention. There are shots in ""The Life Aquatic"" that of inspire those same emotions from ""The Royal Tenenbaums.""And yet it is boring and slow and stupid in narrative. Anderson made this movie to express his apparent love for Jacques Cousteau, but Steve is incompetent and permanently ambivalent -we struggle to *like* him as we did Gene Hackman in ""Tenenbaums."" His relationship with Ned - played by Wilson with a Kentucky-English accent, a pipe and a kind of dreamy maturity - sort of lingers about. And Blanchett, maybe for the first time in his career, is a annoyance, playing the not-really love interest. Take her out of the picture and you save a good 20 minutes, and a good 10 could have been saved on Jeff Goldblum's rival scientist. Anderson assembled an impressive cast but didn't have much to do with them.In its own way ""The Life Aquatic"" is art, meant to do more than just entertain; filmed in Rome and on the Mediterranean Sea, individual scenes stand out as candy-colored still lifes. There are vibrant blues, stormy greens, warm, inviting sands.

Much of the humor is a matter of out-of-place or quirky things that just show up on screen, often for reasons that have not much to do with the plot.  It isn't necessarily subtle humor, on the whole, but it isn't loud either; this isn't much like Airplane! in feel, despite some formal similarities.  So you have a female crew member who walks around the ship topless, with no one remarking on it (Airplane! would have 20 jokes about it).  You have a crew member who sings David Bowie songs in a samba style, in Portuguese.  The underwater creatures are CGI'd to quasi-cartoon effect.  And Bill Murray, just by being what you'd expect him to be (though not in the sense of being overly predictable), is often not what you'd expect a character like the one he plays to be.  He's a Jacques Cousteau who has a suspect knowledge of marine biology and wants to pursue a new species of shark out of revenge, to kill it.Much the same point could be made by saying this is a parody of Cousteau, with a bit of James Bond and human interest thrown in, but it's the kind of parody, like Galaxy Quest, that's also a fairly earnest example of what it parodies, though never completely so.  It's this mixing of earnestness and off-kilterness that gives the movie its peculiar chemistry.  The characters are close enough to real that we care about them and their concerns, and enjoy the film as parody, human drama and adventure.  Low-key parody, human drama and adventure, for the most part.  There is attention to detail, plenty of odd or just right characterization, set decoration, and other points to hold interest.It may have helped that I came to this film with low expectations.  It's the kind of oddity that leaves many people cold, as you can see from the reviews.  But it has its charm, more overtly funny than Lost in Translation and less offensive to your higher sensibilities than a typical Leslie Nielsen comedy.

632333,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B00005JNLQ,Scott Schiefelbein,"[4, 5]","I am a huge fan of Wes Anderson's debut effort, ""Rushmore.""  It was one of the most original, well-written, soulful comedies about teenage life (and our inability to grow beyond it) that I'd ever seen.  And ""Rushmore"" also had a great cast, led by perhaps my favorite actor of all time, Bill Murray.But then came the follow-up, ""The Royal Tennenbaums,"" and Bill Murray was there once again.  It was not a coincidence that ""Tennenbaums"" is not in the same class as ""Rushmore"" either as a comedy or a film, and that it also put Murray off to one side, barely using him.  One was left to speculate about the possibilities of Anderson and Murray teaming up where Murray got the spotlight 100% of the time.Those speculations were brought to fruition with ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou,"" and things are generally what you would expect from this team.  ""The Life Aquatic"" looks and sounds just like a movie one would expect from Max Fisher, the hero from ""Rushmore.""  It's a low-budget, slap-dash affair (watch the hilariously-amateurish gunfight scenes) with whimsical special effects and ludicrous stabs at tragedy.  But the blasting thing's got a heart, and its heart is in the melancholy, bemused visage of Bill Murray.Murray plays the titular Steve Zissou, a minor-league Jacques Cousteau whose best years are both behind him and not all that great.  Murray captures Zissou as a man looking into the abyss of his own mortality and his own futility with an elan only he could muster.  Murray says more with a sidelong glance than many actors can evoke with a soliloquy, and for fans of this long-time great, ""The Life Aquatic"" offers many sterling moments.But the rest of the movie, for all its heart and imagination, does not exceed the sum of its parts.  It's funny in the traditional Wes Anderson way, populated with people who have no idea how pathetic they really are.  And there are lines of brilliant comedy and insight.  But just like Aaron Sorkin's dialogue from ""A Few Good Men"" to ""The American President"" to ""The West Wing"" sounds exactly the same regardless of who is speaking the lines, the Wes Anderson motif is starting to wear a bit thin.  Particularly tiresome is Owen Wilson as a Kentucky Air pilot, whose southern-ness seems to play no role except for Wilson to fulfill some outmoded stereotypes.

SYNONYM see SHOWYLooks like I'm going to have to get honest on you people. I love film more than anyting. If I had the chance to make one, I'd do it in a second flat! I am fully aware of Wes Anderson's career, going back to ""Bottle Rocket"", ""Rushmore"", and ""The Royal Tenenbaums"". Now, with ""The Life Aquatic"", I can safely say that Anderson's best film by far is still ""Rushmore"". Why? It's a simple coming of age story. Ever since ""The Royal Tenenbaums"", it seems that what concerns Anderson is to make films for himself.I was eager to see this film for the simple fact that, yeah, he does make pretty off the wall films. When I did though, I wished to my God, he didn't. This movie is so bad, it left me with a rotten taste in my mouth. It's niether funny, dramatic, nor suspenseful. It's looks as though all of Anderson's jokes are inside or simply for him. The best it got out of me was mere chuckle and it wasn't because a joke was done. Ugh! Seriously, the only thing worth admiring here is how it is shot and the music but looking or sounding good shouldn't justify you to like it. It really seems that Anderson is trying way too hard to be unique and stylish. If you watch it, fine. Just don't feel like you have to love it in order to be cool. This film is so NOT cool, NOT at all. It's boring, not funny, silly, and pretenious! One other thing, is Anderson a homophob? There are a lot of references in the film that poke fun at that community. Words like: bull dike and fag are used to get laughs out of the audience. Wow, that's low.P.S. What is with the Criterion Collection automatically submiting Wes Anderson's films? The only one that deserves it is ""Rushmore"" and that took a while for it to get on.

We keep watching because it's hard to keep a straight face at the sight of Zissous Inc. The 'jokes' are sporadic and borderline moronic but thankfully punctuated frequently by Anderson's trademark brilliance in the script.Rushmore's success hinged on the depth of its protagonist and how much we ended up rooting for him. That's the beauty of our good marine folk in Aquatic, spotlighted without a tangible spinal plot.An ageing Bill Murray is Zissou, no one else in the whole industry can embody deadpan irony with such gumption. The rest of the zany crew includes several A-listers, each accorded a hint of a subplot: an allegedly long-lost illegitimate son (Owen Wilson); a pregnant journalist, whose baby will be ""eleven and a half in twelve years"", shuttling her cautious affections between father and son (Cate Blanchett); a funny German sidekick who craves to be on the ""A Team"" (William Dafoe in a most unusual role); an estranged yet oddly supportive vamp of a wife (Angelina Houston); a beleagured research rival (Jeff Goldblum). There's even a band of Filipino pirates.Best of show however belongs to a swarm of beguilingly nonsensical candy-colored sea critters (very vivid CGI there) and the grand finale aboard a peculiar underwater stealth pod.Mind you, it's all a jaunty departure from the mainstream so if you expecting a film with clearcut introduction-body-conclusion and overt jokes of the Something About Mary variety, you're in for disappointment. Hence the 4 stars.But if you can handle a refreshing loaf from the lives of highly irregular folk, buttered with hints of amusing dialogue, then I recommend this oddity in a blink.",4,"UNEVEN, BUT PACKED TO THE GILLS WITH GOOFS & GAFFES",1111190400,"03 19, 2005",2005,1956,"['character', 'study', 'midlife', 'detachment', 'nudge-nudge-wink-wink', 'take', 'cheesy', '70s', 'style', 'Jacques', 'Cousteau', 'productions', 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'never', 'pretense', 'being', 'anything', 'less', 'kooky.Yet', 'ostensible', 'insincerity', 'never', 'across', 'attempt', 'play', 'cheaply', 'keep', 'watching', 'hard', 'keep', 'straight', 'face', 'sight', 'Zissous', 'Inc', ""'jokes"", 'are', 'sporadic', 'borderline', 'moronic', 'thankfully', 'punctuated', 'frequently', 'Anderson', 'trademark', 'brilliance', 'script.Rushmore', 'success', 'hinged', 'depth', 'protagonist', 'how', 'much', 'ended', 'up', 'rooting', 'beauty', 'good', 'marine', 'folk', 'Aquatic', 'spotlighted', 'tangible', 'spinal', 'plot.An', 'ageing', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Zissou', 'one', 'else', 'whole', 'industry', 'can', 'embody', 'deadpan', 'irony', 'such', 'gumption', 'rest', 'zany', 'crew', 'several', 'A-listers', 'accorded', 'hint', 'subplot', 'allegedly', 'long-lost', 'illegitimate', 'son', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'pregnant', 'journalist', 'baby', 'will', 'be', 'eleven', 'half', 'twelve', 'years', 'shuttling', 'cautious', 'affections', 'father', 'son', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'funny', 'German', 'sidekick', 'who', 'be', 'Team', 'William', 'Dafoe', 'most', 'unusual', 'role', 'estranged', 'yet', 'oddly', 'supportive', 'vamp', 'wife', 'Angelina', 'Houston', 'beleagured', 'research', 'rival', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'even', 'band', 'Filipino', 'pirates.Best', 'show', 'however', 'swarm', 'beguilingly', 'nonsensical', 'candy-colored', 'sea', 'critters', 'very', 'vivid', 'CGI', 'grand', 'finale', 'peculiar', 'underwater', 'stealth', 'pod.Mind', 'jaunty', 'departure', 'mainstream', 'so', 'expecting', 'film', 'clearcut', 'introduction-body-conclusion', 'overt', 'jokes', 'Something', 'Mary', 'variety', ""'re"", 'disappointment', 'Hence', '4', 'stars.But', 'can', 'handle', 'refreshing', 'loaf', 'lives', 'highly', 'irregular', 'folk', 'buttered', 'hints', 'amusing', 'dialogue', 'then', 'recommend', 'oddity', 'blink']",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

This movie would be the duo's third time working together after Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums.Aquatic is a story of an eccentric oceanographer named Steve Zissou who leads his unusual team of documentary film makers and crew in voyages to discover sea life. It all pays off, however, due to the fact that his documentaries are screened worldwide and he has made global fame for years.The beginning of the movie coincides with the death of his top crew member, Esteban, at the jaws of the mysterious 'Jaguar Shark', while the rest of the film pursues Steve and company on a mission to avenge his friend's death and catch the shark. Although, the movie sounds like an action/adventure, it is that but with a modest Wes Anderson type of humor that he's known for. Murray adds his smart wit to the script as well as the remaining cast including Willem Dafoe in his funniest role to date as the sensitive Klaus Daimler and Cate Blanchett as Jane Winslett Richardson, the pregnant reporter who becomes the love interest despite her romantic affair with his newly found son Ned, or Kingsley Zissou, played by Owen Wilson.The movie features animation of the fantasy sea animals which adds a nice touch to the overall fun that the movie offers, as well as one liners that are destined to be repeated constantly by die-hard Zissou fans.Now go get yourself a red cap and speedo!RecommendedB-",4,Zissou is overall fun!,1121212800,"07 13, 2005",2005,1523,"['Life', 'Aquatic', 'Steve', 'Zissou', 'new', 'quirky', 'film', 'directed', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'starring', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'Ghostbusters', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'duo', 'third', 'time', 'working', 'together', 'Rushmore', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums.Aquatic', 'story', 'eccentric', 'oceanographer', 'named', 'Steve', 'Zissou', 'who', 'unusual', 'team', 'documentary', 'film', 'makers', 'crew', 'voyages', 'discover', 'sea', 'life', 'off', 'however', 'due', 'fact', 'documentaries', 'are', 'screened', 'worldwide', 'made', 'global', 'fame', 'years.The', 'beginning', 'movie', 'death', 'top', 'crew', 'member', 'Esteban', 'jaws', 'mysterious', 'Shark', 'rest', 'film', 'pursues', 'Steve', 'company', 'mission', 'avenge', 'friend', 'death', 'catch', 'shark', 'movie', 'action/adventure', 'modest', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'type', 'humor', 'known', 'Murray', 'smart', 'wit', 'script', 'as', 'well', 'remaining', 'cast', 'including', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'funniest', 'role', 'date', 'sensitive', 'Klaus', 'Daimler', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'Jane', 'Winslett', 'Richardson', 'pregnant', 'reporter', 'who', 'love', 'interest', 'romantic', 'affair', 'newly', 'found', 'son', 'Ned', 'Kingsley', 'Zissou', 'played', 'Owen', 'Wilson.The', 'movie', 'animation', 'fantasy', 'sea', 'animals', 'nice', 'touch', 'overall', 'fun', 'movie', 'offers', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'liners', 'are', 'destined', 'be', 'repeated', 'constantly', 'die-hard', 'Zissou', 'fans.Now', 'go', 'get', 'red', 'cap', 'speedo', 'RecommendedB-']",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

Within this film are a homage to other films, and those referenced films cover a wide spectrum, including ADVENTURES OF BUCKAROO BONZAI (the closing credits, the cosmopolitan ""team"" attitude, and including the presence of AoBB star Jeff Goldblum also in this film, are a dead giveaway), to even JAWS, and not just because of the shark but because of a certain memorable pup present in each film.  In fact, after meandering thru this film's plot and style, the fate of the dog ruined what goodwill and open-mindedness I had left.  Bill Murray and all the actors in the cast, don't seem to have anything to do, as long as they got the lines and hit their marks.  Anjelica Huston is spectacularly thrown away in a way I wouldn't have thought possible, she is basically a prop, and how can that happen with someone so charismatic?  Cate Blanchet is one of the great actresses of our time, but here I kept going is it Aussie or is she sticking us with a Brit accent?  Whichever, sometimes I felt she was doing Kate Hepburn again, and wondered if that misdirection was the point.  As this film doesn't seem to know what it is supposed to be, or perhaps it is supposed to be everything.  Willem Dafoe?  How'd he get in this mess?  And David Bowie's music throughout, a little bit of Bowie goes a long way, especially when you can't figure out how the song is applicable for the part of the story in which we're being serenaded.  The whole film comes off as a self-conscious attempt to produce a cult classic, but a true cult classic aspires to be greater than what it's fate is, it doesn't set out to be a cult classic to begin with, but a great movie.  (The same situation as Buckaroo Bonzai, actually, a would-be cult classic.)  The redeeming feature to the screenplay is the Bill Murray character's sudden need in his mid-life crisis to establish an intimate relationship with a son, whether the son is the genuine (genetic) or assumed article, as the parentage is assumed, rather than taken as fact.  And the son seems to require the same assurance/security on his own, which is what leads him to be part of the current voyage.",2,Would-be Cult Classic,1135209600,"12 22, 2005",2005,2232,"['One', 'strangest', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'certainly', 'strangest', 'all-star-cast', 'come', 'along', 'while', 'film', 'are', 'homage', 'other', 'films', 'referenced', 'films', 'cover', 'wide', 'spectrum', 'including', 'ADVENTURES', 'OF', 'BUCKAROO', 'BONZAI', 'closing', 'credits', 'cosmopolitan', 'team', 'attitude', 'including', 'presence', 'AoBB', 'star', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'also', 'film', 'are', 'dead', 'giveaway', 'even', 'JAWS', 'not', 'just', 'shark', 'certain', 'memorable', 'pup', 'present', 'film', 'fact', 'meandering', 'thru', 'film', 'plot', 'style', 'fate', 'dog', 'ruined', 'what', 'goodwill', 'open-mindedness', 'had', 'left', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'actors', 'cast', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'as', 'long', 'got', 'lines', 'hit', 'marks', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 'spectacularly', 'thrown', 'away', 'way', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'thought', 'possible', 'basically', 'prop', 'how', 'can', 'happen', 'someone', 'so', 'charismatic', 'Cate', 'Blanchet', 'one', 'great', 'actresses', 'time', 'here', 'kept', 'going', 'Aussie', 'sticking', 'Brit', 'accent', 'Whichever', 'sometimes', 'felt', 'was', 'doing', 'Kate', 'Hepburn', 'again', 'wondered', 'misdirection', 'was', 'point', 'film', ""n't"", 'seem', 'know', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'perhaps', 'supposed', 'be', 'everything', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'How', ""'d"", 'get', 'mess', 'David', 'Bowie', 'music', 'little', 'bit', 'Bowie', 'long', 'way', 'especially', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'song', 'applicable', 'part', 'story', ""'re"", 'being', 'serenaded', 'whole', 'film', 'off', 'self-conscious', 'attempt', 'produce', 'cult', 'classic', 'true', 'cult', 'classic', 'be', 'greater', 'what', 'fate', ""n't"", 'set', 'out', 'be', 'cult', 'classic', 'begin', 'great', 'movie', 'same', 'situation', 'Buckaroo', 'Bonzai', 'actually', 'would-be', 'cult', 'classic', 'redeeming', 'feature', 'screenplay', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'character', 'sudden', 'need', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'establish', 'intimate', 'relationship', 'son', 'son', 'genuine', 'genetic', 'assumed', 'article', 'parentage', 'assumed', 'rather', 'taken', 'fact', 'son', 'require', 'same', 'assurance/security', 'own', 'what', 'be', 'part', 'current', 'voyage']",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

Gore ""old_sckool""","[1, 1]","As one reviewer said perfectly ""The Life Aquatic is very funny, but its not for everyone"" I would like to add to this statement and tell you a bit about the film, before you give in two hours of your time to watch this. Then maybe from the brief description you will decide if this is a film you will enjoy. ""The Life Aquatic"" has a very simple storyline. Bill Murray plays Steve Zissou who is a famous oceangrapher who is going after the shark that killed his partner while shooting his documentry. The film itself uses alot of dry humor, if you are a fan of slapstick, then this film is not for you. What we get here is a excellent perfomance from Bill Murray, who is once again in great form. You will be seeing Murrays side of his humor that is more gentle and dry, more like his peformances in Rushmore, Kingpin, and Lost in Translation. If you are a fan of Murrays slapstick humor from the movies ""Meatballs"", ""Stripes"", or ""Ghostbusters"" then you might be dissapointed. The film also includeds a great supporting cast along with William Defoe who is in rare form as I believe a German assistant to Murray. The film does have some hangups, as it is really slow. I mean slow. It clocks in at around two hours, and it feels a bit longer because this movie depends all on dry dialoge and there is very else action wise that is happening. If they could have cut it down a bit, I wouldnt have complained, so its not perfect, but still a very good performance buy Murray and Defoe, and still very funny, if the dry type of humor is your thing.",4,"Very funny, but not for everyone",1186358400,"08 6, 2007",2007,1543,"['one', 'reviewer', 'said', 'perfectly', 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'very', 'funny', 'not', 'everyone', 'would', 'like', 'add', 'statement', 'tell', 'bit', 'film', 'give', 'two', 'hours', 'time', 'watch', 'Then', 'maybe', 'brief', 'description', 'will', 'decide', 'film', 'will', 'enjoy', 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'very', 'simple', 'storyline', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Steve', 'Zissou', 'who', 'famous', 'oceangrapher', 'who', 'going', 'shark', 'killed', 'partner', 'shooting', 'documentry', 'film', 'alot', 'dry', 'humor', 'are', 'fan', 'slapstick', 'then', 'film', 'not', 'What', 'get', 'here', 'excellent', 'perfomance', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'who', 'once', 'again', 'great', 'form', 'will', 'be', 'seeing', 'Murrays', 'side', 'humor', 'more', 'gentle', 'dry', 'more', 'peformances', 'Rushmore', 'Kingpin', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'are', 'fan', 'Murrays', 'slapstick', 'humor', 'movies', 'Meatballs', 'Stripes', 'Ghostbusters', 'then', 'might', 'be', 'dissapointed', 'film', 'also', 'great', 'supporting', 'cast', 'William', 'Defoe', 'who', 'rare', 'form', 'believe', 'German', 'assistant', 'Murray', 'film', 'have', 'hangups', 'really', 'slow', 'mean', 'slow', 'two', 'hours', 'bit', 'longer', 'movie', 'dry', 'dialoge', 'very', 'else', 'action', 'wise', 'happening', 'could', 'have', 'cut', 'down', 'bit', 'wouldnt', 'have', 'complained', 'so', 'not', 'perfect', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'performance', 'buy', 'Murray', 'Defoe', 'still', 'very', 'funny', 'dry', 'type', 'humor', 'thing']",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

After watching and really enjoying director Wes Anderson's prior works, especially the fabulous `Rushmore' I had to see this. With big names such as Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Cate Blanchett, Jeff Goldblum and Willem Defoe, I had great expectations, and I was not let down.The plot is rather simple, evolving around great traveller/filmmaker Steve Zissou (Murray), almost a living legend for his documentaries on various journeys and the nature he finds. Unfortunately his recent works have slipped off the pace and looses his best friend to the mysterious `jaguar shark'. Zissou is then approached by Ned, a young admirer of Zissou's work who claims to his son. Zissou takes him on board as part of the merry crew. The rest of the film is how he, and his crew team up to find this shark, and basically aim to blow it to smithereens. Of course things don't really work out; the crew get into all sorts of mess, lack of funding, awkward cloudy father-son relations, crew division, crazy pirates...its shambles, but extremely hilarious...not in a slapstick way but in Anderson's unique quirky style.The acting is simply great throughout the cast. Bill Murray pretty much steals the show; he is in fine form as the melancholic, sarcastic `has-been' that's desperately trying to re-invent himself. He is always trying to cut corners and force himself into the gleaming popularity of his old self, he looks for the father-son relationship creating brilliant tense and awkward conversations. Owen Wilson, while not being as rip-roaringly funny as he can be, is a vital part of the film. Without given any silly or slapstick type humour to work with, he flexes his acting muscles perfectly as the calm, subdued and often nave Ned. Willem Defoe is simply hilarious, playing a highly-strung German, a nice surprise that gave many laughs throughout the film. Cate Blanchett is very solid, playing the woman that rather comically both ""father and son"" (if they can be called that) go for. She is subtle and always brings gentler, more calming side to the film, balancing the eccentric humour that often overwhelms.This film will not please all people, for some it's a unique, weird and wonderful piece of film making, for others it's a completely lame piece of crap.

632358,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JNLQ,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 3]","Stop following the thin story of 'The Life Aquatic,' and you may enjoy the delightfully eccentric characters and its numerous homages to sea-adventure programs.  Wes Anderson gathered a unique collection of characters played by skillful actors including his regular Bill Murray, but mostly the film represents Anderson's love for old-fashioned shows like Jacques Cousteau.  I am a film fan who prefers good story to good characters, and that's the only reason for my lower rating.But there is a story, mainly surrounding Bill Murray's Steve Zissou, whose latest adventure film has just bombed -- even though his best friend was eaten by a big shark.  And that shark happens to be an endangered species, against which Steve publicly declares war, or revenge.  This silly story is quite funny when it is supported by Bill Murray's tired 'what-I-am-doing-now' face.Financial troubles are settled when a young American 'Ned' (Owen Wilson) shows up before him, claiming that he is Steve's son.  Investing the money he inheritated, 'Ned' joins in the expedition team of Steve Zissou, and we are going to meet strange but amusing persons on board the ship 'Bellafonte' (meaning Harry?).The most impressive is the names of the actors -- in addition to excellent Bill Murray, you can see Owen Wilson, CAte Blanchett, Anjelica Huston, Willem Defoe, Jeff Goldblum, Michael Gambon, Bud Cort, Noah Taylor, and famous singer Sue Jorge (whose unique version of one British singer should not be missed).  And Steve Zissou's poor friend (eaten by a shark) is  Seymour Cassel.As I said, the superb production designs (of the ship, mainly) and off-beat characters are the merit of the film.  It is also greatly helped by the candy-color creatures in the sea, animated by Henry Selick (director of 'The Nightmare Before Christmas').  At the same time, however, the film often loses its course, among the unnecessary (so I thought) episodes about the pirates (yes, they attack!), and many homages to other works, mainly documentaries, are too much to me.As to Wes Anderson, I still believe 'Rushmore' is his best, and I remember the great acting from Bill Murray in that funny little film.  Compared with that, 'The Life Aquatic' has more budget and more actors, but to me at least, a less interesting story.  But Bill Murray is still terrific, and the ending is very touching.",3,"(3.5 STARS) Terrific Designs and Bill Murray, But Too Many Homages",1119744000,"06 26, 2005",2005,2356,"['Stop', 'following', 'thin', 'story', ""'The"", 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'may', 'enjoy', 'delightfully', 'eccentric', 'characters', 'numerous', 'homages', 'sea-adventure', 'programs', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'gathered', 'unique', 'collection', 'characters', 'played', 'skillful', 'actors', 'including', 'regular', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'mostly', 'film', 'Anderson', 'love', 'old-fashioned', 'shows', 'Jacques', 'Cousteau', 'am', 'film', 'fan', 'who', 'good', 'story', 'good', 'characters', 'only', 'reason', 'lower', 'rating.But', 'story', 'mainly', 'surrounding', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Steve', 'Zissou', 'latest', 'adventure', 'film', 'just', 'bombed', 'even', 'best', 'friend', 'was', 'eaten', 'big', 'shark', 'shark', 'be', 'endangered', 'species', 'Steve', 'publicly', 'war', 'revenge', 'silly', 'story', 'quite', 'funny', 'when', 'supported', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'tired', ""'what-I-am-doing-now"", 'face.Financial', 'troubles', 'are', 'settled', 'when', 'young', 'American', ""'Ned"", 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'up', 'claiming', 'Steve', 'son', 'Investing', 'money', 'inheritated', ""'Ned"", 'joins', 'expedition', 'team', 'Steve', 'Zissou', 'are', 'going', 'meet', 'strange', 'amusing', 'persons', 'board', 'ship', ""'Bellafonte"", 'meaning', 'Harry', 'most', 'impressive', 'names', 'actors', 'addition', 'excellent', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'can', 'see', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'CAte', 'Blanchett', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 'Willem', 'Defoe', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'Bud', 'Cort', 'Noah', 'Taylor', 'famous', 'singer', 'Sue', 'Jorge', 'unique', 'version', 'one', 'British', 'singer', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'Steve', 'Zissou', 'poor', 'friend', 'eaten', 'shark', 'Seymour', 'Cassel.As', 'said', 'superb', 'production', 'designs', 'ship', 'mainly', 'off-beat', 'characters', 'are', 'merit', 'film', 'also', 'greatly', 'helped', 'candy-color', 'creatures', 'sea', 'animated', 'Henry', 'Selick', 'director', ""'The"", 'Nightmare', 'Christmas', 'same', 'time', 'however', 'film', 'often', 'course', 'unnecessary', 'thought', 'pirates', 'yes', 'attack', 'many', 'homages', 'other', 'works', 'mainly', 'documentaries', 'are', 'too', 'much', 'me.As', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'still', 'believe', ""'Rushmore"", 'best', 'remember', 'great', 'acting', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'funny', 'little', 'film', 'Compared', 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'more', 'budget', 'more', 'actors', 'least', 'less', 'interesting', 'story', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'still', 'terrific', 'ending', 'very', 'touching']",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

I really liked Anderson's previous movie the Royal Tenenbaums, and I was glad to see that in this film, he continued on making a very specific style.

632360,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B00005JNLQ,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[3, 4]","To begin with, I must confess that when I 1st saw THE LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU, I had not yet seen Wes Anderson's most well known film, THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS, or his feature debut, BOTTLE ROCKET. I make this preface because many negative comments of LIFE AQUATIC I have read have been made by Anderson fans who have seen all of his works. I have not and other than RUSHMORE have nothing to compare LIFE AQUATIC to.With that said, I found THE LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU to be a thoroughly enjoyable, entertaining, and emotional film. The movie revolves around Steve Zissou (played to perfection by Bill Murray), a modern-day nature documentary filmmaker and oceanographer not all that unlike the late Jacques Costeau. Zissou is planning what will probably be his final voyage. His company & crew have run out of money and his latest film was the latest in a series of cinematic flops. However, Zissou's life-long friend and co-worker, Esteban du Plantier, was killed by a mysterious shark below water. Zissou promises that his next film will bring closure to Esteban's death and he plans on killing the shark that ate his friend.As plans for the adventure begin, Zissou meets Ned Plimpton, a young man who believes Zissou might be his biological father. The meeting stirs Zissou's emotions and he decides to take Ned under his wing and with him on his later adventure. The theft of an expresso machine, a kidnapping by pirates, and the hunt for a giant shark ensue.Murray is perfectly cast as the title character. Anderson specifically wrote the role for Bill Murray and said that Zissou &#34;could have been no one else&#34;. The quote is correct because no other actor could have captured the slight nuances of the character as well as Murray. Cate Blanchett, Anjelica Huston, and Owen Wilson pull off some decent supporting performances, but other than Murray, Willem Dafoe and Jeff Goldblum are the actors to watch. Dafoe, who is best known for his creepy bad-guy roles, is hilarious as Klaus Daimler, the German camera-man aboard Zissou's crew. As for Goldblum, he's worth watching any time he's in a movie, but it's particular enjoyable to see him as a semi-bad-guy as Zissou's arch rival, Alistair Hennessey.LIFE AQUATIC contains all kinds of cool visual images, from rainbow fish to box stage sets. However, one of the best things about the movie isn't the visual images but the soundtrack. The film's soundtrack is largely composed of David Bowie songs sung by a variety of people, but most notably Seu Jorge. Accompanying these new interpretations are a variety of memorable instrumental pieces (most notably &#34;Ping Island/Lighting Strike Rescue Op&#34;) composed by Mark Mothersbaugh.THE LIFE AQUATIC is a movie that is filled with surprises. There were several times that the movie took a turn I didn't expect it to. None of these turnings were all that far-fetched and the situations and reactions seemed real and kept me engaged in the characters on screen. Though the THE LIFE AQUATIC is a movie all dressed up, it also has a lot of substance. At it's core the film is a redemption story. It's all about a man and how is life is redeemed not solely through any actions of his own, but through the actions of others. One could even say that the film is an allegory of faith and a spiritual epiphany and unlike Ahab and Moby Dick, things don't turn out too bad in the end.",5,Baptism and Redemption,1396569600,"04 4, 2014",2014,3396,"['begin', 'must', 'confess', 'when', '1st', 'saw', 'THE', 'LIFE', 'AQUATIC', 'WITH', 'STEVE', 'ZISSOU', 'had', 'not', 'yet', 'seen', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'most', 'well', 'known', 'film', 'THE', 'ROYAL', 'TENENBAUMS', 'feature', 'debut', 'BOTTLE', 'ROCKET', 'make', 'preface', 'many', 'negative', 'comments', 'LIFE', 'AQUATIC', 'have', 'read', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'Anderson', 'fans', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'works', 'have', 'not', 'other', 'RUSHMORE', 'have', 'nothing', 'compare', 'LIFE', 'AQUATIC', 'to.With', 'said', 'found', 'THE', 'LIFE', 'AQUATIC', 'WITH', 'STEVE', 'ZISSOU', 'be', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'entertaining', 'emotional', 'film', 'movie', 'Steve', 'Zissou', 'played', 'perfection', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'modern-day', 'nature', 'documentary', 'filmmaker', 'not', 'late', 'Jacques', 'Costeau', 'Zissou', 'planning', 'what', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'final', 'voyage', 'company', 'crew', 'have', 'run', 'money', 'latest', 'film', 'was', 'latest', 'series', 'cinematic', 'flops', 'However', 'Zissou', 'life-long', 'friend', 'co-worker', 'Esteban', 'du', 'Plantier', 'was', 'killed', 'mysterious', 'shark', 'water', 'Zissou', 'next', 'film', 'will', 'bring', 'closure', 'Esteban', 'death', 'killing', 'shark', 'ate', 'friend.As', 'plans', 'adventure', 'begin', 'Zissou', 'meets', 'Ned', 'Plimpton', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'Zissou', 'might', 'be', 'biological', 'father', 'meeting', 'Zissou', 'emotions', 'take', 'Ned', 'wing', 'later', 'adventure', 'theft', 'expresso', 'machine', 'kidnapping', 'pirates', 'hunt', 'giant', 'shark', 'ensue.Murray', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'title', 'character', 'Anderson', 'specifically', 'wrote', 'role', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'said', 'Zissou', '34', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'else', '34', 'quote', 'correct', 'other', 'actor', 'could', 'have', 'captured', 'slight', 'nuances', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'Murray', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'pull', 'off', 'decent', 'supporting', 'performances', 'other', 'Murray', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'are', 'actors', 'watch', 'Dafoe', 'who', 'best', 'known', 'creepy', 'bad-guy', 'roles', 'hilarious', 'Klaus', 'Daimler', 'German', 'camera-man', 'Zissou', 'crew', 'Goldblum', 'worth', 'watching', 'time', 'movie', 'particular', 'enjoyable', 'see', 'semi-bad-guy', 'Zissou', 'arch', 'rival', 'Alistair', 'Hennessey.LIFE', 'AQUATIC', 'kinds', 'cool', 'visual', 'images', 'rainbow', 'fish', 'box', 'stage', 'sets', 'However', 'one', 'best', 'things', 'movie', ""n't"", 'visual', 'images', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'largely', 'composed', 'David', 'Bowie', 'songs', 'sung', 'variety', 'people', 'most', 'notably', 'Seu', 'Jorge', 'Accompanying', 'new', 'interpretations', 'are', 'variety', 'memorable', 'instrumental', 'pieces', 'most', 'notably', '34', 'Ping', 'Island/Lighting', 'Strike', 'Rescue', 'Op', '34', 'composed', 'Mark', 'Mothersbaugh.THE', 'LIFE', 'AQUATIC', 'movie', 'filled', 'surprises', 'were', 'several', 'times', 'movie', 'took', 'turn', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'None', 'turnings', 'were', 'far-fetched', 'situations', 'reactions', 'seemed', 'real', 'kept', 'engaged', 'characters', 'screen', 'THE', 'LIFE', 'AQUATIC', 'movie', 'dressed', 'up', 'also', 'lot', 'substance', 'core', 'film', 'redemption', 'story', 'man', 'how', 'life', 'redeemed', 'not', 'solely', 'actions', 'own', 'actions', 'others', 'One', 'could', 'even', 'say', 'film', 'allegory', 'faith', 'spiritual', 'epiphany', 'Ahab', 'Moby', 'Dick', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'turn', 'out', 'too', 'bad', 'end']",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

They set out to kill the shark that ate his partner at the beginning. Father and son fall for an unmarried pregnant reporter also on board (don't ask). There is a shipboard kidnapping and deadly shoot-outs on board and on a deserted island. This is a comedy. No kidding.Yes, we are sailing in waters in which the imaginative director.

This movie was co-written and directed by Wes Anderson. I don't know if you are familiar with him, but he has a uniquely odd style to his work. In this venture THE LIFE AQUATIC, he takes his odd style, and tweaks it a bit, creating a sea faring adventure for the intellectual stoner type. ARRRR, yes there is pirates in it! And also multitudes of animated sea creatures, designed by the same team that did Tim Burtons Nigthmare Before Christmas.Oh yeah, and Bill Murray is FUNNY! I really dig it. I was getting a little bored with the sullen, sulky roles he has been placed in (especially in the Wes Anderson roles). Here, he plays the title role of Steve Zissou, who is a wise cracking, not-so-smooth talking A-hole, who is trying to dig his ocean documentary making career out of the toilet.A lot of strange quirks along the way, such as Seu Jorge, who appears sporadically throughout the film playing guitar and singing Portugese renditions of David Bowie songs.

632368,A3N5XIM9R2OQH0,B00005JNLQ,Wheelchair Assassin,"[4, 6]","I must say, I was prepared for something different the first time I sat down to watch The Life Aquatic, but not quite *this* different.  This is definitely one of the most odd American movies to get a wide release in the past decade, right up there with Adaptation, The Big Lebowski, and of course Anderson's previous Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums.  It starts out with an offbeat revenge plot--Cousteau-like oceanographer Steve Zissou seeks to find and kill the ""jaguar shark"" that ate his longtime friend and collaborator Esteban--but it gradually evolves into a seafaring adventure that's heavy on innovation and introspection.  The Life Aquatic may even be Anderson's best movie yet (discounting Bottle Rocket, which I have yet to see)--it's more complex and nuanced than Rushmore, and not quite as self-consciously weird as The Royal Tenenbaums, or at least not as distracting in its weirdness.  Even more than those movies, this one can occasionally feel like a lark, but its relative aimlessness is just part of its low-key charm, and it never disguises the film's ample heart.The humor is absolutely nothing like what you'll get in the typical broad Hollywood comedy, as the comedic timing is off-key and the jokes are generally delivered in the most deadpan of voices (especially pretty much all of Bill Murray's jokes), but The Life Aquatic is still a very funny movie, even if you might have to watch it more than once to pick it all up.  Just as important, and what sets it apart from Anderson's previous work (and just about everything else), The Life Aquatic looks absolutely incredible.  Anderson & Co. obviously put as much thought into the look and feel of this film as they did the plot and characterization, as it's a visual stunner of the first order: awash in color, brilliantly lit and imaginatively shot, and filled with all sorts of exotic marine life.  Even the fast-paced, frenetic gunfight scenes are lovingly staged.  And since the whole adventure is being filmed, there are some opportunities for a nifty movie-within-a-movie effect, which Anderson manages to pull off without ever stooping to gimmickry.As I (and others) have already noted, The Life Aquatic isn't a ""normal"" movie by an any means (although normalcy is overrated anyway), but it's all pulled off with Anderson's trademark emotional depth, and populated with characters that are largely believable in spite of their eccentricities.  At the movie's center is one of recent film history's more unlikely love triangles: Bill Murray as Steve Zissou himself, Owen Wilson as his could-be son and new collaborator Ned, and the impossibly cute Cate Blanchett as Jane, the pregnant, no-nonsense reporter who accompanies Steve and his crew on their mission to find the jaguar shark.  Zissou, and Murray's portrayal of him, is essentially a reprise of Herman Blume from Rushmore--aging, disaffected and emotionally repressed, looking for some companionship and understanding as he reaches his midlife crisis--but Murray once again succeeds in making his character sympathetic, turning in yet another brilliantly understated performance.  Even now, in the ""mature"" stage of his career, Murray is funny, but now he's added an ability to convey more with a few unaffected lines and a facial expression than most actors could with a whole movie worth of emoting.  I swear, if Hollywood ever makes a movie about Shaquille O'Neal, I'd buy Murray in the role of Shaq without hesitation.Ned, whom he meets at the movie's outset, clearly provides Zissou with a chance at redemption in the face of his declining prestige and deteriorating marriage, although even then Zissou remains ambivalent about the massive change in his life his (probable) son represents.  This ambivalence is only compounded when Steve and Ned both develop a ""thing"" for Jane, whose own issues make her somewhat of a kindred spirit for the two of them.  Plus, there's the resentment Ned engenders in Steve's Germanic sidekick Klaus (the great Willem Dafoe), and Steve's ongoing rivalry with the grant-hogging Alastair Hennessy (the equally great Jeff Goldblum) to complicate things.  Oh, and there are some pirates thrown into the equation just for good measure as well.Perhaps the most striking aspect of this movie is just how difficult to classify it is, definitely more so than Rushmore and arguably than The Royal Tenenbaums as well.  There are comedic, romantic, dramatic, and fantastic elements to be found (not to mention the aforementioned gun battles), but at the same time The Life Aquatic doesn't quite fit the mold of a comedy, drama, romance, or fantasy.  Since I like this movie so much, I like to think its difficulty to pigeonhole is what accounts for all the negative reactions it's generated.  But whatever the case, I found The Life Aquatic to be a trip, and the kind that gets better with repeated viewings.  It's not always down to Earth, but given the current constitution of reality, an occasional flight of fancy is to be greatly appreciated.",5,Literally and figuratively fantastic,1134172800,"12 10,

Perhaps Wes Anderson had intended to make this film an adventure drama with a twist on family and relationship issues. It's a very strong followup film for the Oscar-nominated Bill Murray(Lost In Translation), especially he gets to carry this movie, and flexing his acting muscles opposite some of the finest actors in the industry including Willem Dafoe and Anjelica Huston. Even if this film doesn't generate much laughs, it still has plenty of touching moments, and the underwater scenes are total eyecandy. Actually in the bonus disc, I found out that some of the marine life are puppets.Murray played Captain Steve Zissou, and he's an acclaimed aquatic documentary film maker. His best friend in the team was killed by the rare and gigantic Jaguar Shark during a mission. He intended to go out to sea to kill it and  capture it on film and show the world. Meanwhile, a new member(Ned/Owen Wilson) joins the team for the adventure, and he confessed to Zissou that he's actually his son. Anjelica Huston played Zissou's wife, whose  parents are extremely wealthy. They are not happy together, and Zissou actually has for thing for the five-month pregnant and single reporter(Jane) played Cate Blanchett, but she's interested in Ned. Dafoe is Zissou's sidekick(Klaus) , who speaks in a strange German accent, and feels underused. Jeff Goldblum(Alistaire) is Zissou's vival, but he's severely underused in this film.The gun fight scene was kind of tacky, but the music composed by Mark Mothersbaugh really worked for this movie thoroughly. The mostly electronic composed score is perfect for floating and bouncy feel of this movie. I also enjoyed watching the landscapes captured along the water.I actually found Owen Wilson's performance to be quite impressive and wonderful.

Thinking is not something you can do in this film because it is not a logical work. How much reality can you suspend? Bill Murray is brilliant as always and carries the film by himself. Some of the lines in the script are brilliant. But I don't agree that you can write a brilliant movie with everyone just wandering around lost in space - or out to sea, if you like. And I don't think you can blame the script writers totally for characters that are two-dimensional. The actors have to take part of the blame. Anjelica Houston replays 'Morticia'. Owen Wilson comes from the Kevin Costner school of acting - 'running the emotional gamut from A to B' - how is it that non-actors get so much work? Willem Defoe must have done this for the money - although I think he gets a kick out of his part. Cate Blanchett never seems to understand who she is but does what she can. Jeff Goldblum does a take on George Hamilton complete with tan and slicked back hair. What a waste of major talents.
