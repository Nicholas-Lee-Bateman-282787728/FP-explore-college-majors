Acting, costumes and sets are superb, but it is all built on a nearly perfect script fleshed out of a novel that was just as great now as it was in it's day.Veiwers of the northern U.S. climes may not ""get it"", but ignore the tomato throwing toward Mrs. Hurdle's accent. It was dead on.  If you've ever spent time in the deep, antebellum south, you'll still hear the older women talk much like this. I imagine that the actress did her research and the time period would have resulted in an even deeper, regionalized (probably Alabama) southern accent than you hear people speak with now.  It is bourne out of the region's french influence mixed with appalachian.More oddly contrasted was some actors missing accent all together as in Cheryl Campbell's Lady Carbury.  How would a cad like Felix end up with a mancusian accent coming from a home with refined nearly-american accents like her's and her daughter Hetta? Strange choice, that he would put that vocal suit on.Even with these minor quafs, the film is just an excellent ride.",4,Just About Perfect,1194307200,"11 6, 2007",2007,1072,"['great', 'way', 'spend', 'rainy', 'weekend', 'Acting', 'costumes', 'sets', 'are', 'superb', 'built', 'nearly', 'perfect', 'script', 'fleshed', 'novel', 'was', 'just', 'great', 'now', 'was', 'day.Veiwers', 'northern', 'U.S.', 'climes', 'may', 'not', 'get', 'ignore', 'tomato', 'throwing', 'Mrs.', 'Hurdle', 'accent', 'was', 'dead', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'spent', 'time', 'deep', 'antebellum', 'south', ""'ll"", 'still', 'hear', 'older', 'women', 'talk', 'much', 'imagine', 'actress', 'did', 'research', 'time', 'period', 'would', 'have', 'resulted', 'even', 'deeper', 'regionalized', 'probably', 'Alabama', 'southern', 'accent', 'hear', 'people', 'speak', 'now', 'bourne', 'region', 'french', 'influence', 'mixed', 'appalachian.More', 'oddly', 'contrasted', 'was', 'actors', 'missing', 'accent', 'all', 'together', 'Cheryl', 'Campbell', 'Lady', 'Carbury', 'How', 'would', 'cad', 'Felix', 'end', 'up', 'mancusian', 'accent', 'coming', 'home', 'refined', 'nearly-american', 'accents', 'daughter', 'Hetta', 'Strange', 'choice', 'would', 'put', 'vocal', 'suit', 'minor', 'quafs', 'film', 'just', 'excellent', 'ride']",N/A

I've read other novels by Trollope but not this one, and I'm sure the film is no more slanderous or condescending than the book.As British literature never tires of reminding us, ""Jews are treacherous, money-grubbing, don't know how to behave in public, can't hold their liquor, are doomed to failure because of their innate and eternal un-Englishness, etc."" It's all here, folks. The poisonous caricature lives, in that charming, marvelous, unapologetic way of the British establishment, centuries-old and alas, still very much with us today.If Melmotte is from the Continent, why does David Suchet play him with a Cockney Jewish accent instead of something more Teutonic? So we'll feel more comfortable watching the character self-destruct? He's played more like an ambitious tailor than an international financier.In fact, I was astonished that this story was selected for dramatization at all.

The series is wonderful and stands very well on its own.  Maybe there are further nuances to be picked up by reading the novel but the series so satisfied me that I really don't feel the need (or have the time).  These are fully fleshed out characters populating the Victorian London scene and the opportunities and risks inherent in being there and then.  Some characters are utterly ruthless, such as the lead character, the financier.  Others are still mired in the whole world of class, titles, gentlemen and ladies.  They can barely make a move since that existence is like trying to make headway by walking in a bog or a swamp. Others are ambitious but not necessarily for titles and acceptance.  They want to build railways and forge the future.  The sympathy factor is greatest for those characters.  This is all very engrossing and kept me front and center in front of the tv screen.  The greatest conflict, however, is between the lead character/financier and his daughter.  He makes many moves regarding his daughter that set into play the rest of the dramatic force of the entire piece.  They are equally matched characters.

I can live with changes to a story, but only if those changes don't change it materially or take away from its spirit.  The changes made by Andrew Davies to The Way We Live Now upset me greatly -- he most definitely did change the story to the point where its essence was no longer recognizable.The Way We Live Now is considered by many (yours truly included) to be Trollope's masterpiece.  Trollope's Melmotte is a thoroughly corrupt man, but Davies glosses over this corruption to focus on Sir Felix Carbury's sex life.  People will say that, with only a few hours to work with, certain choices have to be made.  I fully understand that.  But Davies' choices baffle me.  Why not show the depth of Melmotte's corruption and greed?  Why not show what a true and complete disaster the dinner party for the Chinese emperor was?  The dinner party was, in my opinion, the turning point of the book.  It's where Melmotte's downfall goes from being mere rumor to being public knowledge. This is key to the story, and I'd rather have seen that on my screen than Sir Felix rolling in the hay with Ruby. It has nothing to do with prudishness.  It does, however, have everything to do with the fact that Trollope wrote about white collar crime and corruption, and this film shows us very little about what Trollope wrote.But, as per usual, Davies has other things on his mind.  His Sir Felix Carbury is a misunderstood, lovable cad.  Trollope's is a dissolute, depraved man whose selfishness and self-absorption almost ruin his mother and sister.  In the book, we see that Sir Felix tries to rape Ruby, but Davies glosses over this by putting it way off into the background. Davies would rather focus on Marie Melmotte's attempts to grope Sir Felix at her father's dinner table than on the original story.The cast is outstanding, except for Miranda Otto (she and her truly embarrassing attempt at an American accent are woefully miscast as Mrs. Hurtle -- I hope she's gotten better since this) and Cillian Murphy (he looks delicate enough to be a girl, not an engineer trying to strike it rich in the American southwest), as are the production values.  It's just such a shame that the story is butchered almost beyond recognition.  Trollope's ending is not ambiguous.  Sir Felix pays for his sins.  Davies' ending is nothing if not ambiguous.

690363,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B00005YUNK,Doug Anderson,"[10, 10]","I believe it was Freud who said that the two great motivators in human affairs are money and sex. But the only motivator that is on display in Anthony Trollope's THE WAY WE LIVE NOW is money. Ok, that is not entirely true. There are at least four characters who are motivated by higher things. But, by and large, the message writ loud and clear in this novel and series is that money is what moves people to do what they do and the pursuit of personal fortune is the engine that drives men to build empires.Perhaps no one is more aware of Freud's observation than Lady Carbury. Though the Carbury's are a noble family, they are also a family that has fallen on hard times. In an attempt to swell the dwindling family fortune Lady Carbury begins writing pulp historical fiction with titles like The Wicked Women of History. Even though she is nobility her literary taste and talent are strictly Grub Street as are her social mores and in order to solicit publisher Mr. Brown's interest in her book she is willing to solicit herself to Mr. Brown. Lady Carbury has two children, Felix and Henrietta (Hetta). Felix is a fop and a wastrel who gambles, whores, and drinks; while Hetta is a pure soul driven only by genuine love. Felix, like his mother, has few scruples and is also driven by the desire to land a fortune using any means necessary. When Felix discovers that the internationally famous financier Melmotte has an unmmarried daughter named Marie, Felix, assured of his own irresistable charms, sets his sites on capturing the Melmotte fortune by marrying Marie.The (unofficial) Carbury family motto is ""virtue ain't the way the world works."" Or, at least, this is Lady Carbury and Felix's motto. Hetta is disgusted by the both of them and sets her sites on Mr. Paul Montague, a dashing young engineer just back from California and with big plans to find backers for his next big project, the South Pacific Railway.In other words, all paths to Melmotte lead.Melmotte is a larger than life character who also happens to be Jewish, so while nearly all of London needs to court his financial favor, they loathe having to shake his hand. Melmotte is well aware of this, but he doesn't care for he gets a perverse pleasure out of making the proud British lords and ladies grovel at his feet. No dream is too big for Melmotte and the penultimate dream of this Viennese Jew is to become an English lord and sit in Parliament. This character is really more of a caricature but Trollope avoids the charge of antisemitism by using the character not to cast apsersions on any particular ethnicity but to reveal the social hypocrisy of late nineteenth-century Britain.Melmotte's motto is to make history (by financing world changing projects like the South Pacific Railroad) but make money too. His other motto is that it is your duty to make yourself rich and he delivers this second one during an extravagant dinner in which he views his guests as so many gluttons grabbing all they can get and devouring it. Melmotte in all of his egotistical glory sees himself as the master of the feast. The moment is surreal and is one of those instances when you appreciate how well the BBC revises the classics, even the minor ones.The only character that trumps Melmotte himself for our attentions is his daughter Marie (played by Shirley Henderson). Every financially strapped English lord in London tries to win her favor in order to access her father's fortune but she is a very strange creature indeed and Henderson obviosuly has a ball with the character while never quite making her into a caricature. Marie is perhaps the most victimized creature in the entire four-part miniseries because all that she wants is to be loved but no one can see her as anything but as a stepping stone to her fathers money. When Felix comes courting and plants a kiss on her she thinks she has finally found happiness, but of course she hasn't, and her reactions are immensely watchable. She's strange, very strange, ""like an odd little monkey"" as one guest says, but also very interesting.Needless to say the greedy get their just desserts.

His characters were never caricatures or sterile, but fully-developed and interesting, even the most fleeting. And his plots, while not the engine to the story, moved the characters in ways worth following. While not my favorite novel, this is a fine book, with many wonderful, scintillating stories (too many really!) and a cast that makes the head dizzy with their deceptions and foolishness,Hard stuff to film, and given the new Masterpiece Theater interest in flair over substance, it is especially challenging. The sets are amazing, the costumes gorgeous, the hair and small details all spot-on (have we ever seen a character step in manure before? though it must have been all over). Yet somehow, the thing never hangs together. People drive Trollope's tales, long, complicated speeches between those who know each other well, and when that is lost, it would require much better writing than is evidenced here to be successful.The actors act and look well, but never inhabit their characters. Though there are many fine ones present, (other than Mrs. Hurtle and that annoying Gone With the Wind accent) they are forced to superficialize when compressing so much into so little time. It is not a disaster; the board meetings are truly wonderful, the easily manipulated greedily applauding their pickpocket, and poor Brehgert is just beautifully drawn. But Marie is just shrill, Felix is annoying, and Melmotte himself comes across as all puff and bombast. It's hard to see in this how he could maintain his illusion for so long. And the required coincidences that seem more plausible in a big book look especially cloying when removed from their camouflage.

He touches on society at all levels with a sharper and far less kind eye than he brings to bear on either his Barchester world or his Palliser world.  No one in this world is likeable, so while the book makes a compelling read, adapting it with the intense intimacy required by a good TV adaptation is a major challenge.  Without the mediating genius of Trollope's language, why would anyone want to spend time with these people?This adaptation solves this problem brilliantly.  David Suchet carries the core of the story.  This is no rehash of Poirot.  Suchet's Melmot is a beautifully realized and complex character:  his performance is all that Trollope would have wished.Beyond that, this adaptation is faithful to both the spirit and the letter of the novel.  To engage viewers in trenchant social satire that is as relevant today as it was in Trollope's time (think Enron), to shine light into the darkness of these people's lives, and to treat them with both severity and compassion is what the novel does brilliantly.  And what this adaptation does brilliantly.

Wrong! I know Andrew Davies is famous for sexing up all his adaptations but this was ridiculous, even for him.I will admit, most of the actors were good with what they were given. The problem is, often I didn't like what they were given! Sir Felix as played by the lovely Matthew MacFadyen was portrayed as much more sympathetic as in the book and really isn't punished in the end. I think Davies was a little fond of the character, actually. His sister Hetta is unrecognizable from the book, being outspoken and free-spirited in the beginning- always giving her mother and brother a piece of her mind. I did find Hetta pretty boring for most of the book because she doesn't do much but it didn't really have any impact when she went against her family to be with Paul, since she was always so openly against them from the start!Mrs. Hurtle as played by Miranda Otto was horrible. The pitiful excuse for a Southern accent was grating to my ears. I found her character one of the most interesting in the book and still sympathetic, but not so in the mini. As for Paul Montague, they tried to make him a stronger character but I really didn't buy it from pretty boy Cillian Murphy. What were they thinking putting such an effeminate looking man in that part?I did like the casting of Lady Carbury, Roger Carbury, and Mr. Melmotte. The latter was very close to how I imagined him in the book.

I haven't read the novel so I can't compare it to the film, but the film stands on its own as good entertainment.I found the first part of the series very funny.  Matthew MacFayden was terrific and  almost lovable as the quintessential cad. As awful as his behavior was he lit up his scenes with his presence.  David Suchet was brilliant as the troubled and troubling entrepreneur whose desire to become a proper English gentleman was his undoing.  I loved the portrayal of his wife.  She had few words and seemed to have a strange, awkward expression on her face that was comical.  I loved the scene in which she sat alone (no one ever wanted to talk to her) outside feeding a cupcake to her dog.  It was sad and funny at the same time.The real surprise and scene stealer was Shirley Henderson, as Suchet's daughter.  At first she seemed dreadfully stupid but as the film went on she showed a ferocity that matched that of her father.  She was terrific!  The one disappointment was Cillian Murphy as the ""hero,"" Paul.

690394,A1JUYF5D6TFFHB,B00005YUNK,"Rudy Avila ""Saint Seiya""","[16, 18]","Yes, absolutely, the strong theme of this classic Victorian ntale by Anthony Trollope published in the 1870's rings true in our present day. The BBC first released it and then it was broadcast on ExxonMobile Masterpiece Theater on PBS/KCET in America in 2001. On DVD, it's a treasure to own if you liked it the first time around. Four, 75 minute episodes comprise this grand and moving story. The cast includes David Suchet as the power-hungry and corrupt Melmotte, whose shadow looms big in both novel and film. Shirley Henderson, an adorable dimunitive woman plays his rebellious and spirited daughter Marie, Cheryl Campbell as the social-climbing writer Lady Cardbury, Matthew MacFadyen as the two-faced, insensitive gambler Felix, Baeza as Paul Montague, who is on a more noble path of marrying for love instead of money or societal benefit, to the equally sincere and idealistic Hedda, Lady Cardbury's oldest daughter. The mood of this story, with authentic Victorian costumes, mostly dark clothing, is what made me love this film. Throughout the film there is an air of inevitable despair and gloom, as if the world is losing its soul to the capitalistic venom of industrialism and in man's pursuit of power. However, it is a film balanced in contrast by humor (mostly with the courtship of Lady Cardbury and her suitor) and by characters who are optimistic and turn their backs on the pursuit of money. It is perhaps the greatest novel to satirize Victorian mores and fastidiousness and pokes fun at the imperalism of Queen Victoria's day. Surely Queen Victoria disliked this novel if she read too much into it. But the Queen never had time to read such novels, which were probably considered modern or even offensive. It is straightforward and it packs a cynical bite. There is one scene in which Malmotte and his colleagues eat a lavish dinner and gorge themselves like pigs. This is who they really are, power-hungry and piggish, far from the conventional image of elegant, conservative and restrained English folk.The characters in this movie, and moreover the actors portraying them, carry the film. Sushet's Malmotte is not so much an example of the Anti-Semitic sentiment in Victorian literature but a symbolic figure who stands for the totally corrupt and soulless man. An Austrian-Jew he may be, but even Trollope meant to imply that British men of upper classes were like this. Malmotte is insensitive, cruel and ambiitous. His dream of a railroad across North and South America costs more than money, it costs people's lives. Felix, though of a lower station than Melmotte, is equally as wicked in his own way. He is in constant pursuit of pleasures- be they gambling houses or whores- and has no real love for the rich Marie Melmotte, whom he courts. When Marie realizes what a cad he really is, she despairs and believes that all men are like him. Her notion of marrying for love is never realized but Hetta and Paul do triumph in the end. Their story is markedly different than Melmotte's. Melmotte is brought down by his own greed and loses respect from his peers at the House of Common and literally has a downfall. Paul's relationship with a fiery American woman from the South is a nice touch but I thought she was too much a figure of stereotypical American women in the 19th century. Like a heroine in Henry James, she is a liberated woman and not the more conservative and traditionalist women of Europe. Nevertheless, she is not seen as a kind of heroine. It is Hedda we are rooting for. The music is moving, and the acting is really powerful. Enjoy this classic costume drama with a message that rings true today. Aren't we a society that is constantly in search of capitalist ventures ? I am not a Communist but I do realize that we are driven by a need to market all the time. We are a commercial society. In the process, we often lose our souls and we forget people's basic needs of love and family.

690395,AY3AVLL5IWW9,B00005YUNK,Russell Fanelli,"[2, 2]","Augustus Melmotte is the heart and soul of Anthony Trollope's classic 19th Century novel, The Way We Live Now and David Suchet's magnificent performance as Melmotte, the financial wonder of the age, in the film adaptation of the novel is worthy of a best actor Academy Award.  Suchet shows us the richness and complexity of this swindler and thief who constructs a Ponzi Scheme  that would have made Bernie Madoff proud.  Melmotte is the black hole that draws most of the characters in the novel and film into a downward spiral of moral and financial destruction.  Suchet's Melmotte is by turns friendly and cajoling, threatening and pugnacious, thoughtful and reflective.  He is Machiavelli's financial prince of thieves who uses his power to build great wealth for himself as he destroys others with a smile on his face and a pat on their back.Another outstanding performance is delivered by Shirley Henderson, who plays Melmotte's daughter Marie.  This is a difficult role.  Marie starts off the film as confused and vulnerable, yet in the end she shows that she is brave and resilient with steel in her backbone.  We watch her transformation from jilted lover to a determined woman of the world ready to protect herself by her will and wits. Henderson is a capable actress who shows us the complexity of this important foil to Melmotte's plans to save himself and his business empire.Unfortunately, some of the other actors are not up to the high standard set by Suchet and Henderson, particularly Cillian Murphy, who plays the part of Paul Montague, Melmotte's business adversary.  Murphy comes across as an often confused, weak person; not at all what Trollope had in mind.  Part of the blame must go to the writers who wrote the script version of the novel and the director, who did not fully understand Montague's character.Even though I was disappointed in this important part of the film, overall I can highly recommend not only the film, but also the book, which I have reviewed for Amazon.

690396,A2X4PBSVF3CGSK,B00005YUNK,"SeekingTraveler ""SeekingTraveler""","[1, 1]","""The Way We Live Now"" was a four-part (5-hour-long) BBC television series (from 2001) of the Anthony Trollope novel of the same name (from 1875). Trollope writes about complex human situations that are mature and timeless. He is one of my favorite writers. I read the novel immediately prior to watching the series. This dramatization follows the Trollope novel fairly accurately, but there were a few unnecessary deviations (but this always seems to happen with these BBC adaptations). I loved the novel; I think it is Trollope's best. I enjoyed this miniseries; I think they did a great job. Casting, costumes, and settings are all very good.I read the novel and watched this series at the height of the recent financial collapse and the associated destruction of real estate prices, personal fortunes, companies, countries, and cities. Although the novel was written 137 years ago,Trollope's sub-plots of greedy scoundrels engaged in stock frauds, debt scams, and general chicanery and flim-flam smack of modern-day Wall Street and Washington, DC. That is to say, the con games of the 1870s are still going on today. But then, this kind of shenanigans has probably been going on since Gilgamesh was a baby.One thing I enjoy about Trollope's stories is that they involve complex adult interactions within the confines of various societal frameworks. Trollope seems to find most of these frameworks to be quite ridiculous, a point of view that he expresses brilliantly with subtle satirical wit. When translating Trollope to film, this subtlety is sometimes replaced with something a little more immediate and exaggerated. I can easily forgive the television producers for this liberty, since I still greatly enjoyed their series.If you enjoy Trollope, also check outThe Barchester ChroniclesandThe Pallisers - The Complete Collection.

690400,A3G36QYR6PWME9,B00005YUNK,Timothy P. Stallcup,"[3, 3]","I had recently watched the adaptation of ""He Knew He Was Right,"" which I considered more than a partial failure, but decided to give the BBC and Trollope a second chance.  ""The Way We Live Now"" more than repaid the effort. First, the story was much more conducive to Trollope's talents, which are best engaged with the worlds of politics and business, not just the societal scene and the ever present chase to marry for money and position.  Mr. Melmotte, brilliantly played by David Souchet (who manages to be charming, seductive, diabolical, and troll-like, often in the same scene) comes to England from the Continent with a reputation as the ultimate financier with a storied talent for raising money.  Fortunately for him, and less so for his investors, his reputation for squandering that money and leaving town before facing the angry mob has not nipped quite so closely at his heals. He proceeds to promote the opportunity of a lifetime, a proposed railroad between Salt Lake City and the coast of Mexico--Vera Cruz if memory serves (it may not).  Of course, he raises a fortune, but fails to build or even finance the railroad and is finally caught out, leading to his demise.  Souchet as Melmotte is hypnotizing as he rises through English society, seduces the moneymen and aristocrats through a combination of lavish expenditure, flattery, salesmanship and cajolery. Of course, they are nearly as corrupt as he and willing to turn a blind eye to his shady dealings (and his ancestral heritage--there is a probing treatment in the series about the position of Jews in English society) as long as the price of shares continues to rise.  Melmotte's demise is classic and even a bit tragic as, for once, he seems to want to belong, to be an Englishman, to sit in the House of Commons, to have a country home, to really be what he seems and possibly even create something.  Unfortunately, he forgets the falsity of his own stories and overstays his welcome, to his ruin.Along the way, we are treated to a number of marvellous subplots, including Melmotte's daughter Marie (wonderfully played by Moaning Myrtle of Harry Potter fame) who falls in love with one of the greatest callow cads of all time, Felix Carbury, a liar, drunk, gambler and cheat, constantly coddled by his mother, who is nonetheless thoroughly engaging and who, among a less accomplished cast, might steal the show.  The other subplots are strong, including the triangular affair of Paul Montague, one of the originators of the railroad, Hetta Carbury, whom he loves, and Mrs Hurtle, the scarlet woman from his past, an American who knows what she wants (Paul) and intends to have him, even should it involve the use of a pistol.  My only complaint is Miranda Otto's accent as Mrs Hurtle. It isn't necessarily inaccurate (Otto is I believe an Australian doing an American accent), but it is irritating, and Otto herself is stiff and shows none of the engaging passion she exhibited in The Lord of the Rings films.All in all, this is a terrific production in its own right and well worth the time and effort, whether or not it lives up to the expectations of fans of the novel, or varies from Trollope's original in significant ways.",5,Nearly flawless,1330041600,"02 24, 2012",2012,3206,"['had', 'recently', 'watched', 'adaptation', 'Knew', 'Was', 'Right', 'considered', 'more', 'partial', 'failure', 'decided', 'give', 'BBC', 'Trollope', 'second', 'chance', 'Way', 'Live', 'Now', 'more', 'repaid', 'effort', 'First', 'story', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'conducive', 'Trollope', 'talents', 'are', 'best', 'engaged', 'worlds', 'politics', 'business', 'not', 'just', 'societal', 'scene', 'ever', 'present', 'chase', 'marry', 'money', 'position', 'Mr.', 'Melmotte', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'David', 'Souchet', 'who', 'be', 'charming', 'seductive', 'diabolical', 'troll-like', 'often', 'same', 'scene', 'England', 'Continent', 'reputation', 'ultimate', 'financier', 'storied', 'talent', 'raising', 'money', 'Fortunately', 'less', 'so', 'investors', 'reputation', 'squandering', 'money', 'leaving', 'town', 'facing', 'angry', 'mob', 'not', 'nipped', 'quite', 'so', 'closely', 'heals', 'promote', 'opportunity', 'lifetime', 'proposed', 'railroad', 'Salt', 'Lake', 'City', 'coast', 'Mexico', 'Vera', 'Cruz', 'memory', 'serves', 'may', 'not', 'course', 'fortune', 'build', 'even', 'finance', 'railroad', 'finally', 'caught', 'out', 'leading', 'demise', 'Souchet', 'Melmotte', 'hypnotizing', 'English', 'society', 'moneymen', 'aristocrats', 'combination', 'lavish', 'expenditure', 'flattery', 'salesmanship', 'cajolery', 'course', 'are', 'nearly', 'as', 'corrupt', 'willing', 'turn', 'blind', 'eye', 'shady', 'dealings', 'ancestral', 'heritage', 'probing', 'treatment', 'series', 'position', 'Jews', 'English', 'society', 'as', 'long', 'price', 'shares', 'rise', 'Melmotte', 'demise', 'classic', 'even', 'bit', 'tragic', 'once', 'want', 'belong', 'be', 'Englishman', 'sit', 'House', 'Commons', 'have', 'country', 'home', 'really', 'be', 'what', 'possibly', 'even', 'create', 'something', 'Unfortunately', 'falsity', 'own', 'stories', 'welcome', 'ruin.Along', 'way', 'are', 'treated', 'number', 'marvellous', 'subplots', 'including', 'Melmotte', 'daughter', 'Marie', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'Moaning', 'Myrtle', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'fame', 'who', 'love', 'one', 'greatest', 'callow', 'cads', 'time', 'Felix', 'Carbury', 'liar', 'drunk', 'gambler', 'cheat', 'constantly', 'coddled', 'mother', 'who', 'nonetheless', 'thoroughly', 'engaging', 'who', 'less', 'accomplished', 'cast', 'might', 'steal', 'show', 'other', 'subplots', 'are', 'strong', 'including', 'triangular', 'affair', 'Paul', 'Montague', 'one', 'originators', 'railroad', 'Hetta', 'Carbury', 'whom', 'Mrs', 'Hurtle', 'scarlet', 'woman', 'past', 'American', 'who', 'what', 'Paul', 'have', 'even', 'should', 'involve', 'use', 'pistol', 'only', 'complaint', 'Miranda', 'Otto', 'accent', 'Mrs', 'Hurtle', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'inaccurate', 'Otto', 'believe', 'Australian', 'doing', 'American', 'accent', 'irritating', 'Otto', 'stiff', 'none', 'engaging', 'passion', 'exhibited', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'films.All', 'terrific', 'production', 'own', 'right', 'well', 'time', 'effort', 'not', 'up', 'expectations', 'fans', 'novel', 'varies', 'Trollope', 'original', 'significant', 'ways']",N/A
690401,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B00005YUNK,Z Hayes,"[8, 8]","The Way We Live Now is a 2001 BBC production that is an adaptation of Anthony Trollope's novel of the same name. The story has at its center the story of Augustus Melmotte [a magnificent David Suchet], a European financier who comes to London to set up shop, accompanied by a docile wife and daughter, Marie [Shirley Henderson]. Melmotte is actually a swindler, but does such a good job of cloaking his true designs that it is not till much later that his chicanery is exposed.Though Melmotte's story is the center of the story, there are numerous other sub-plots that keep the story fresh and intriguing - Matthew McFadyen [Mr Darcy of Pride and Prejudice 2005] plays Sir Felix Carbury, an impoverished baronet with a gambling addiction who tries to woo Marie Melmotte to get her inheritance, his sister Hetta Carbury [Paloma Baeza] plays a sensible girl who finds herself rejecting the advances of her cousin in favour of the attentions of a young engineer and railroad builder, Paul Montague [Cillian Murphy], Georgiana Longstaffe [Anne-Marie Duff] a young lady of noble birth who finds herself yearning to be married, yet lacking suitable suitors, and Mrs Hurtle [Miranda Otto] an American who comes to London hoping to rekindle her affair and regain the affections of Paul Montague.It is indeed hard to compress Anthony Trollope's work into a 6 hour mini-series, and the series doesn't do the book justice in this aspect. But, it is nevertheless an entertaining, well-acted adaptation with a stellar cast that paints a vivid portrayal of London society in the late 19th century - characterised by greed, corruption, ambition, love, and human frailty. The attention to period detail adds a lot to one's enjoyment of the series and truly evokes the atmosphere of the times. Though I felt some of the characters lacked sufficient development -case in point being Marie Melmotte who goes from being a love-struck swooning damsel to a woman of resolve all too quickly, the story is well-told in general.This is a series worth watching if you are an Anglophile, a fan of period dramas, or just interested in a well-told story. David Suchet's performance as the overly ambitious Melmotte alone makes it a compelling watch.",4,"A well-acted, albeit condensed version of Anthony Trollope's work.",1209168000,"04 26, 2008",2008,2220,"['Way', 'Live', 'Now', '2001', 'BBC', 'production', 'adaptation', 'Anthony', 'Trollope', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'story', 'center', 'story', 'Augustus', 'Melmotte', 'magnificent', 'David', 'Suchet', ']', 'European', 'financier', 'who', 'London', 'set', 'up', 'shop', 'accompanied', 'docile', 'wife', 'daughter', 'Marie', '[', 'Shirley', 'Henderson', ']', 'Melmotte', 'actually', 'swindler', 'good', 'job', 'cloaking', 'true', 'designs', 'not', 'till', 'much', 'later', 'chicanery', 'Melmotte', 'story', 'center', 'story', 'are', 'numerous', 'other', 'sub-plots', 'keep', 'story', 'fresh', 'intriguing', 'Matthew', 'McFadyen', '[', 'Mr', 'Darcy', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', '2005', ']', 'Sir', 'Felix', 'Carbury', 'impoverished', 'baronet', 'gambling', 'addiction', 'who', 'woo', 'Marie', 'Melmotte', 'get', 'inheritance', 'sister', 'Hetta', 'Carbury', '[', 'Paloma', 'Baeza', ']', 'sensible', 'girl', 'who', 'rejecting', 'advances', 'cousin', 'favour', 'attentions', 'young', 'engineer', 'railroad', 'builder', 'Paul', 'Montague', '[', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', ']', 'Georgiana', 'Longstaffe', '[', 'Anne-Marie', 'Duff', 'young', 'lady', 'noble', 'birth', 'who', 'yearning', 'be', 'married', 'yet', 'lacking', 'suitable', 'suitors', 'Mrs', 'Hurtle', '[', 'Miranda', 'Otto', ']', 'American', 'who', 'London', 'hoping', 'rekindle', 'affair', 'regain', 'affections', 'Paul', 'Montague.It', 'indeed', 'hard', 'compress', 'Anthony', 'Trollope', 'work', '6', 'hour', 'mini-series', 'series', ""n't"", 'do', 'book', 'justice', 'aspect', 'nevertheless', 'entertaining', 'well-acted', 'adaptation', 'stellar', 'cast', 'vivid', 'portrayal', 'London', 'society', 'late', '19th', 'century', 'characterised', 'greed', 'corruption', 'ambition', 'love', 'human', 'frailty', 'attention', 'period', 'detail', 'lot', 'one', 'enjoyment', 'series', 'truly', 'atmosphere', 'times', 'felt', 'characters', 'lacked', 'sufficient', 'development', '-case', 'point', 'being', 'Marie', 'Melmotte', 'who', 'being', 'love-struck', 'swooning', 'damsel', 'woman', 'resolve', 'too', 'quickly', 'story', 'well-told', 'general.This', 'series', 'watching', 'are', 'Anglophile', 'fan', 'period', 'dramas', 'just', 'interested', 'well-told', 'story', 'David', 'Suchet', 'performance', 'overly', 'ambitious', 'Melmotte', 'alone', 'compelling', 'watch']",N/A
