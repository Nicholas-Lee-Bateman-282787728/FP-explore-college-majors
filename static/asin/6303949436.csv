This movie was obviously slanted toward the female gender, but I have to admit that I did actually enjoyed this  film, at least, most of it.  Why?  To tell you the truth, I'm not really  sure.  Keanu Reeves is certainly on my list of least favorite actors (I use  the word `actor' with great reservation here), and the ending of this film  was so overblown and melodramatic that I sat shaking my head in  embarrassment.Maybe I ended up liking it because of its nastalgia and  innocense.  I could readily see this as a 1940's Jimmy Stewart vehicle  (Lord knows, it would have been better, but Reeves work here wasn't too  bad).  The setting is Napa Valley in 1945, and the boys are coming home  after the war.  This is a boy meets girl film, and most of it works pretty  well.  However, the butterfly scene in the vineyards is just one of many  outrageous contrivances (along with the grape stamping scene).  Even though  I had to grit my teeth a few times, I came away with a nice, warm, fuzzy  feeling...so I guess that says something.  Between 1 and 10, ""A Walk in the  Clouds"" gets a 6 from me.  If the ending wasn't so stupidly melodramatic, I  would have added another star.

Roger Ebert said, ""I love everything about this movie."" and I want to trust the late Mr. Ebert than the reviewer here. Keanu Reeves is wonderful as the moral and upstanding Paul Sutton who steps in to protect a young lady from her father's wrath when the girl admits she is returning home pregnant from college, deserted by her professor who is the baby's father. You have to have an understanding of post-war America in the 1940's when this situation was dire for a woman and where a woman having a baby out of wedlock was shunned. This is where the moral compass of Reeves' character settles, on pretending to be her husband for a night and then leaving her a note in the morning to say he has abandoned her. In those days, yes, it would be terrible, but not as bad as telling you are pregnant and the boyfriend won't marry you.Reeves is handsome and persuasive, realizing he is falling in love with his pretend wife, and knowing he has to return to the wife he knew for three days before being sent off to war for four years. His character make all the right moral decisions and such a plot device is hard to find in movies of this generation.This is a film you can watch over and over again.

391222,A31UE0LJBKCHUA,6303949436,A Customer,"[12, 13]","A Walk in the Clouds is not a new, ground-breaking film that challenges the intellect.  But it never said it was trying to be.  It is the warm, familiar Tollhouse Cookie just out of the oven in a kitchen full of exotic deserts being made, constantly trying to outdo each other.Keanu Reeves, whom I usually detest, gives a surprisingly warmer side and shows emotion in his dialogue (which is completely free from sexual innuendos and the use of the word ""dude""-a first for Mr. Reeves, I believe).  Aitana S&aacute;nchez-Gij&oacute;n is a fresh new talent.  Giancarlo Giannini has a convincing character of a man who doesn't pull any punches, yet alludes to a deeper, more human side underneath.  Anthony Quinn, probably the biggest name in this production, is the warm, sweet grandfather, who has the best lines of the film (""I have faith in my son and I have faith in you.... but your fly is open"").There is a reign of Romanticism in this film, and in the tradition of Like Water for Chocolate, A Walk in the Clouds is designed to evoke the senses, setting the majority of the movie in a rather large Napa vineyard, and having such scenes as the one where the family crushes the grapes (without the assitance of Lucille Ball, I'm afraid).  Such scenes are complimented by the music, with a decidedly Mariachi feel.A Walk in the Clouds is meant to be a film that tells a sweet story of a love that conquers its adversaries (much like many of the MGM movie musicals-Brigadoon comes to mind), and leaves the viewer with a satisfied, warm, feeling at the end.

391228,A79WW6K24SOYW,6303949436,Amazon Customer,"[22, 24]","Just viewed this movie for the third or fourth time since seeing it at the show ten years ago, and still find it an amazing film, for light entertainment-slash-sentimental love story. (Note to all would-be movie reviewers: Learn how to review a movie for what it is, on its own terms, and not for what it is not.) Its a period piece, with stunningly gorgeous cinematography and locales, and a pretty good turn at story-telling, craftsmanship and acting - yes - even on Keanu Reeves' part. (There seems to be a trend amongst male movie reviewers to give `de facto bad reviews' to such actors as Brad Pitt and Keanu Reeves, 'just because'. Its a sad testament to the frailty of the male ego that some of us feel threatened, challenged, and even competitive with a guy we probably don't even know, and will most likely never meet.) Anyway, I don't really know what movie the Amazon reviewer saw, because, frankly, he was blatantly wrong on all the salient points about this film.First off, its a good movie, for its genre and the story it tells. Next, Keanu Reeves is completely plausible, and likable in his role as a war Veteran who saw, and endured many terrible things during his time of service, attempted to forget it all, then tried to come back to a normal life with a wife he married on a spur of the moment, as many soldiers do, hoping to make it work. (There was even a pivotal scene between Keanu and Giancarlo Giannini, where he explains why and how he had to `close himself off' emotionally, to do what he had to do to survive the horrors of war, hence, his stoicism, which the Amazon reviewer somewhat shallowly dismisses as `wooden'.) He shows real emotion when he needs to - and where it is required - mainly, in his scenes with Aitana Sanchez-Gijon, for whom he has real affection, and not Debra Messing, his `impulse' bride. Which would explain (to those who were paying attention) why he really didn't care that she was `cheating on him' with Armistead. Or, for that matter, the vineyard fire at the end, which, to him, must have been much like the scorched battlefields he experienced during the war. (What type of war hero runs and screams with everyone else when such an event occurs?) What the Amazon reviewer calls `wooden', others would label `grace under fire' (no pun intended), or just keeping a level head.Guess what, reviewer: The farmhands were not chasing insects with their `gossamer wings', but actually try to divert heat onto the vines during a night of killing frost. To this viewer, Keanu Reeves didn't seem `terribly self-conscious', but more like a man who was genuinely and hopelessly in love with someone he barely knew, and trying desperately to impress that upon both her, and her unrelentingly suspicious and un-welcoming father.In his defense, the Amazon reviewer was actually talking about the `VHS Tape edition', so, its possible he may have seen a completely different movie all together, one other than what most of the viewers here saw. But this reviewer, for one, loved this movie, the ensemble of actors, the locales, the soundtrack, and the quiet, easy way it creeps into the sentimental heart of most people who see it - even us guys.

391231,AK6UVFSU07NXH,6303949436,Anthony Hinde,"[19, 22]","When I use the term Adult Fairytale, some might think of films like, ""The Princess Bride"" or ""Ever After"" but ""A Walk in the Clouds"" is a more suitable example. Director Alfonso Arau has created a magical story peopled by outsized characters and placed in a spiritual world called the Aragon Estate. The film permits we mere mortals to visit this world, a Spanish style winery nestled in California's Napper Valley. We arrive along with Paul Sutton, Keanu Reeves; a stranger in a strange land.Paul's background is economically exposed at the start of the movie. A man returns from World War II, hoping to greet his wife whom he met and married just before shipping out. He dreams of a meaningful life, surrounded by a loving family. His small goals are those of an orphan who has had a lonely life and whose ordeals in battle have condensed his wishes to the simple, important things. Sadly his wife, Betty, is more interested in money and its trappings. She has a lot of spirit but little heart or interest for Paul's modest ambitions. He no sooner arrives than he is pushed out the door to earn some money selling chocolates; a job he wasn't enthusiastic about even before the war.At this point we are still grounded in the real world, although Paul has an unearthly element to him that is hinted at. For example, any soldier that writes a letter to his wife every day, despite receiving virtually no replies, has more than the average dose of hope and optimism. The real world serves as a backdrop for the rest of the film, contrasting starkly with the soft images, haunting score and honest dialogue that characterises life at the Aragon Vineyard. On a train journey to one of his sales calls, Paul meets Victoria Aragon. She forms a bridge, between these two worlds, that Paul traverses in a series of jerks and lurches. A run of accidents result in Paul volunteering to help the beautiful but miserable young woman. I'm certain these accidents represent fate taking a hand in the lives of two who are destined for love.Victoria is played by Aitana Sanchez-Gijon in her first English speaking role. Victoria's problem, being unmarried and pregnant, is magnified by having to face a traditionalist family and a strict and passionate father, Alberto. The solution seems obvious to the chivalrous Paul. He suggests playing the part of her husband, a man who fears responsibility and will soon leave her. In this way Paul hopes her honour will be maintained in the eyes of her family and any bitterness will, instead, fall on his absent shoulders. It is a good plan, only complicated in execution by the couple's growing love and Paul's desire for the rich family life that Victoria takes for granted. The turning point seems to come during a family ritual, performed after picking the harvest. All the married women are enticed into a large wooden vat to crush the grapes. This prosaic activity is actually a lusty and sensual attempt to harness the ancient powers of some fertility god. Not even Paul can stand against Victoria's almost unwitting seduction. This is truly one of the sexiest pieces of footage I can remember seeing; and all without resorting to nudity or the sharing of body fluids.Another rope around Paul's neck is the family's patriarch, Don Pedro Arag&oacute;n, played with amazing assurance and grace by Anthony Quinn. Don Pedro seems to see through all deceptions, going straight to the heart of the matter. He guides, prods and manipulates Paul to discover, and even pursue, his love of Victoria. In fact if I have any criticism of the film it is that next to Anthony Quinn, Keanu seems like a wooden doll, particularly during the preparations for the drunken serenade. But even this seems appropriate for Paul's character, so inexperienced in the ways of family.Several Journeys take place in the film; Paul's path from orphanage to family, Victoria's reluctant steps from deception to honesty, her father Alberto's change from taskmaster to loving parent. Even the audience takes a journey. We start out wanting to escape our troubles with a little light entertainment and walk away looking inward, trying to decide if we are on a path as fulfilling as that of Paul and the Arag&oacute;n family. ""A Walk in the Clouds"" clearly rejects mindless materialism, a philosophy mirrored by Paul's war-bride rejecting him. Instead we are asked to believe that family, honest labour and honour make up the soil our soul should take root in. We may not all have root stock as steeped in tradition as the Aragon's but like Paul, perhaps we will have the sense to recognise rich earth when we see it.",5,"Magical, romantic, meaningful.",1058140800,"07 14, 2003",2003,4615,"['When', 'use', 'term', 'Adult', 'Fairytale', 'might', 'think', 'films', 'Princess', 'Bride', 'Ever', 'Walk', 'Clouds', 'more', 'suitable', 'example', 'Director', 'Alfonso', 'Arau', 'created', 'magical', 'story', 'peopled', 'outsized', 'characters', 'placed', 'spiritual', 'world', 'called', 'Aragon', 'Estate', 'film', 'mere', 'mortals', 'visit', 'world', 'Spanish', 'style', 'winery', 'nestled', 'California', 'Napper', 'Valley', 'arrive', 'Paul', 'Sutton', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'stranger', 'strange', 'land.Paul', 'background', 'economically', 'exposed', 'start', 'movie', 'man', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'hoping', 'greet', 'wife', 'whom', 'met', 'married', 'just', 'before', 'shipping', 'out', 'meaningful', 'life', 'surrounded', 'loving', 'family', 'small', 'goals', 'are', 'orphan', 'who', 'had', 'lonely', 'life', 'ordeals', 'battle', 'have', 'condensed', 'wishes', 'simple', 'important', 'things', 'Sadly', 'wife', 'Betty', 'more', 'interested', 'money', 'trappings', 'lot', 'spirit', 'little', 'heart', 'interest', 'Paul', 'modest', 'ambitions', 'sooner', 'pushed', 'out', 'door', 'earn', 'money', 'selling', 'job', 'was', ""n't"", 'enthusiastic', 'even', 'war.At', 'point', 'are', 'still', 'grounded', 'real', 'world', 'Paul', 'unearthly', 'element', 'hinted', 'example', 'soldier', 'letter', 'wife', 'day', 'receiving', 'virtually', 'replies', 'more', 'average', 'dose', 'hope', 'optimism', 'real', 'world', 'backdrop', 'rest', 'film', 'contrasting', 'starkly', 'soft', 'images', 'haunting', 'score', 'honest', 'dialogue', 'life', 'Aragon', 'Vineyard', 'train', 'journey', 'one', 'sales', 'Paul', 'Victoria', 'Aragon', 'bridge', 'two', 'worlds', 'Paul', 'series', 'jerks', 'lurches', 'run', 'accidents', 'result', 'Paul', 'volunteering', 'help', 'beautiful', 'miserable', 'young', 'woman', ""'m"", 'certain', 'accidents', 'represent', 'fate', 'taking', 'hand', 'lives', 'two', 'who', 'are', 'destined', 'love.Victoria', 'played', 'Aitana', 'Sanchez-Gijon', 'first', 'English', 'speaking', 'role', 'Victoria', 'problem', 'being', 'unmarried', 'pregnant', 'magnified', 'having', 'face', 'traditionalist', 'family', 'strict', 'passionate', 'father', 'Alberto', 'solution', 'obvious', 'chivalrous', 'Paul', 'playing', 'part', 'husband', 'man', 'who', 'responsibility', 'will', 'soon', 'leave', 'way', 'Paul', 'honour', 'will', 'be', 'maintained', 'eyes', 'family', 'bitterness', 'will', 'instead', 'fall', 'absent', 'shoulders', 'good', 'plan', 'only', 'complicated', 'execution', 'couple', 'growing', 'love', 'Paul', 'desire', 'rich', 'family', 'life', 'Victoria', 'granted', 'turning', 'point', 'come', 'family', 'ritual', 'performed', 'picking', 'harvest', 'married', 'women', 'are', 'enticed', 'large', 'wooden', 'vat', 'crush', 'grapes', 'prosaic', 'activity', 'actually', 'lusty', 'sensual', 'attempt', 'harness', 'ancient', 'powers', 'fertility', 'god', 'Not', 'even', 'Paul', 'can', 'stand', 'Victoria', 'almost', 'unwitting', 'seduction', 'truly', 'one', 'sexiest', 'pieces', 'footage', 'can', 'remember', 'seeing', 'resorting', 'nudity', 'sharing', 'body', 'rope', 'Paul', 'neck', 'family', 'patriarch', 'Don', 'Pedro', 'Arag', 'oacute', 'played', 'amazing', 'assurance', 'grace', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'Don', 'Pedro', 'see', 'deceptions', 'going', 'straight', 'heart', 'matter', 'prods', 'manipulates', 'Paul', 'discover', 'even', 'pursue', 'love', 'Victoria', 'fact', 'have', 'criticism', 'film', 'next', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'Keanu', 'wooden', 'doll', 'particularly', 'preparations', 'drunken', 'serenade', 'even', 'appropriate', 'Paul', 'character', 'so', 'inexperienced', 'ways', 'family.Several', 'Journeys', 'take', 'place', 'film', 'Paul', 'path', 'orphanage', 'family', 'Victoria', 'reluctant', 'steps', 'deception', 'honesty', 'father', 'Alberto', 'change', 'taskmaster', 'loving', 'parent', 'Even', 'audience', 'journey', 'start', 'out', 'wanting', 'escape', 'troubles', 'little', 'light', 'entertainment', 'walk', 'away', 'looking', 'inward', 'trying', 'decide', 'are', 'path', 'as', 'fulfilling', 'Paul', 'Arag', 'oacute', 'family', 'Walk', 'Clouds', 'clearly', 'mindless', 'materialism', 'philosophy', 'mirrored', 'Paul', 'war-bride', 'rejecting', 'Instead', 'are', 'asked', 'believe', 'family', 'honest', 'labour', 'honour', 'make', 'up', 'soil', 'soul', 'should', 'take', 'root', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'root', 'stock', 'steeped', 'tradition', 'Aragon', 'Paul', 'perhaps', 'will', 'have', 'sense', 'recognise', 'rich', 'earth', 'when', 'see']",A Walk in the Clouds VHS

I enjoy just as much every time.Reeves plays a young soldier (Paul Sutton) returning from tough combat duty in the Pacific Theater of WWII. He returns to a ""Last minute bride"" whom he met only briefly before he shipped out, and it is no surprise that they have trouble connecting on his return. When he starts travelling for his job of selling chocolates, he meets and befriends a young woman ""in trouble"" ... as it was called in those days. She is pregnant out of wedlock, and he offers to ease the transition for her very conservative family and very judgmental father by posing as her husband until she can get a handle on her problems.As others have mentioned, the scenery is rustic and beautiful, and the young lady's family, owners of a vineyard, ring true with a variety of personalities and emotional reactions. Of course, things get a little complicated when Paul actually falls in love with Victoria, and the process of winning over her father is understandably difficult.Anthony Quinn, in one of his later roles, plays the kind and wise grandfather to perfection, and other members of the family disappear into their roles to give you a true sense of family and a generational family enterprise. Scenes of the nuts and bolts of what happens on a vineyard just add to the movie's charm and authentic atmosphere.Reeves gives his oft used performance of a steady, caring, solid young man who cares about those he encounters and is ready to do whatever he can to help.Some call this a chick flick, but I'm not sure what guy wouldn't want to be in Paul's shoes: the rescue and love of a fair maiden (OK, not really a maiden in the definitive sense lol), the adventure of a new undertaking, the challenge of winning over people ... all are engaging and interesting elements that give this story so much depth and vigor.Highly recommended.",5,Captivating and beautiful,1376611200,"08 16, 2013",2013,1915,"['movie', '20th', 'year', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'number', 'times', 'enjoy', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'young', 'soldier', 'Paul', 'Sutton', 'returning', 'tough', 'combat', 'duty', 'Pacific', 'Theater', 'WWII', 'Last', 'minute', 'bride', 'whom', 'met', 'only', 'briefly', 'shipped', 'out', 'surprise', 'have', 'trouble', 'connecting', 'return', 'When', 'travelling', 'job', 'selling', 'chocolates', 'young', 'woman', 'trouble', 'was', 'called', 'days', 'pregnant', 'wedlock', 'ease', 'transition', 'very', 'conservative', 'family', 'very', 'judgmental', 'father', 'posing', 'husband', 'can', 'get', 'handle', 'problems.As', 'others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'scenery', 'rustic', 'beautiful', 'young', 'lady', 'family', 'owners', 'vineyard', 'ring', 'true', 'variety', 'personalities', 'emotional', 'reactions', 'course', 'things', 'get', 'little', 'complicated', 'when', 'Paul', 'actually', 'love', 'Victoria', 'process', 'winning', 'father', 'understandably', 'difficult.Anthony', 'Quinn', 'one', 'later', 'roles', 'kind', 'wise', 'grandfather', 'perfection', 'other', 'members', 'family', 'disappear', 'roles', 'give', 'true', 'sense', 'family', 'generational', 'family', 'enterprise', 'Scenes', 'nuts', 'bolts', 'what', 'vineyard', 'just', 'add', 'movie', 'charm', 'authentic', 'atmosphere.Reeves', 'oft', 'used', 'performance', 'steady', 'caring', 'solid', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'encounters', 'ready', 'do', 'whatever', 'can', 'help.Some', 'call', 'chick', 'flick', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'guy', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'Paul', 'shoes', 'rescue', 'love', 'fair', 'maiden', 'OK', 'not', 'really', 'maiden', 'definitive', 'sense', 'lol', 'adventure', 'new', 'undertaking', 'challenge', 'winning', 'people', 'are', 'engaging', 'interesting', 'elements', 'give', 'story', 'so', 'much', 'depth', 'vigor.Highly', 'recommended']",A Walk in the Clouds VHS

This film was not a huge box office smash but its one of my favorite films with Reeves.  The story is an old fashioned romance set against the Napa Valley wine country of Southern California at the end of World War II.  Alfonso Arau, who also directed the great film &quot;Like Water for Chocolate&quot; uses lush colors, deep and rich, to convey the passion and sensuality, perfectly complimenting the storyline.

I'm more of a horror or action film type of guy. I'm usually forced only by the girlfriend or because I enjoy a good Keanue Reeves film once in awhile. The movie is beautiful to look at, but by the end I was so sick of hearing about vineyards. I could care less about Mexican tradition or vineyards when I'm trying to watch a romantic film. Unfortunately so much is dedicated to it, it loses sight of what the film is about. I felt like it was thrown in to add to the runtime. The relationship between the two leads wasn't strong enough. I didn't really feel any kind of natural spark. Any romance that does happen is beyond corny and laughable. I would much rather rewatchThe Notebook, or even be forced to watchThe Vowagain.

391253,A1BDPRQ7BEUNLP,6303949436,"Erik Olson ""Seeker Reviews""","[75, 77]","I've enjoyed a number of Keanu Reeves' movies, from ""Bill and Ted"" and ""The Matrix"" to the more recent ""Constantine.""  ""A Walk in the Clouds"" is one of his forays into the romance genre, and it's a favorite of mine in that category.  The story begins during the waning days of WWII, where Army veteran Paul (Reeves) arrives in San Francisco after four years of combat.  He makes his way home and surprises a wife he barely knows.  After an awkward reunion, she practically shoves him out the door the next day with an admonition to start raking in the bucks by selling chocolates.  The life of a traveling salesman is not what he had in mind, but he decides to make a go of it for her sake.On a train bound for Sacramento, Paul literally bumps into Victoria, a mysterious, attractive Latino woman (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon) who immediately vomits on him.  After a couple more odd encounters, they wind up together on the side of a country road.  She tearfully informs Paul that her grad school professor-slash-lover impregnated and then dumped her.  She fears that her ultra-conservative, autocratic father Alberto (Giancarlo Giannini) will kill her for soiling the Aragon family name by returning home an unwed mother.  A scheme is hatched where Paul agrees to pose as Victoria's husband for a day, and then abandon her so she can save face.  Of course, things don't quite work out so easily, especially when Paul and Victoria begin to have feelings for each other.""A Walk in the Clouds"" is a visual and relational treat.  The scenery of the Aragon estate and surrounding vineyard is almost otherworldly in its lush beauty (hence the movie's title), and made me want to book the next flight to California wine country (even more than ""Sideways"" did).  More impressive was the close-knit traditional Latino family atmosphere, dramatically embodied in the sensual winemaking ceremony, where the married women dance the newly harvested grapes into juice.  However, all is not perfect in paradise.  Alberto is threatened by his non-traditional daughter and Stanford educated son, who wants to apply modern business theory to the old-world winery.  ""Gringo"" Paul becomes the focal point for his insecurities, and their conflict escalates towards an uncertain and traumatic resolution.Some have criticized Keanu Reeves for having a ""wooden"" demeanor.  True, he's not the most expressive performer in cinema.  But his low-key acting style perfectly fits the character of Paul, a man of the stoic WWII generation dealing with PTSD and his status as an orphan.  I was able to sympathize with and root for Paul throughout his journey, and I commend Mr. Reeves for enabling me to do that.  The other actors also turn in excellent performances, especially the late Anthony Quinn as Don Pedro, the chocolate loving, brandy drinking sage patriarch who takes Paul under his wing.  He provides a good contrast to Giannini's driven Alberto, so concerned about preserving his family that he's forgotten how to love them.  And I can't leave out the lovely Aitana Sanchez-Gijon, whose passionate and intelligent Victoria is the thinking man's movie-character catch.""A Walk in the Clouds"" is one of the most romantic movies I've ever seen, and it holds up well under repeated viewings.  Highly recommended.WARNING:  The next paragraph has some SPOILER content, but for those concerned with moral content I want to comment on Paul's character and must do so within the context of a choice he makes.I was surprised and gladdened that Paul was an honorable man who valued family relationships and put the needs of others before his own desires.  He doesn't take the easy way out from his albatross wife, even after finding the woman and family he's always longed for.  Paul perseveres through sexual temptation, not because of dogma, but because he cares about Victoria and doesn't want to hurt her.  Despite his feelings for Victoria, he demonstrates loyalty to his shallow, materialistic wife and tries to work things out.  That kind of virtue is somewhat rare in a Hollywood production these days, and lends a welcome old-fashioned, family-friendly air to the movie (END OF SPOILER).",5,An excellent old-fashioned love story.,1109980800,"03 5, 2005",2005,4159,"[""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'number', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'movies', 'Bill', 'Ted', 'Matrix', 'more', 'recent', 'Constantine', 'Walk', 'Clouds', 'one', 'forays', 'romance', 'genre', 'favorite', 'mine', 'category', 'story', 'waning', 'days', 'WWII', 'where', 'Army', 'veteran', 'Paul', 'Reeves', 'San', 'Francisco', 'four', 'years', 'combat', 'way', 'home', 'wife', 'barely', 'awkward', 'reunion', 'practically', 'out', 'door', 'next', 'day', 'admonition', 'start', 'raking', 'bucks', 'selling', 'chocolates', 'life', 'traveling', 'salesman', 'not', 'what', 'had', 'mind', 'make', 'go', 'sake.On', 'train', 'bound', 'Sacramento', 'Paul', 'literally', 'Victoria', 'mysterious', 'attractive', 'Latino', 'woman', 'Aitana', 'Sanchez-Gijon', 'who', 'immediately', 'vomits', 'couple', 'more', 'odd', 'encounters', 'wind', 'up', 'together', 'side', 'country', 'road', 'tearfully', 'Paul', 'grad', 'school', 'professor-slash-lover', 'impregnated', 'then', 'dumped', 'ultra-conservative', 'autocratic', 'father', 'Alberto', 'Giancarlo', 'Giannini', 'will', 'kill', 'soiling', 'Aragon', 'family', 'name', 'returning', 'home', 'unwed', 'mother', 'scheme', 'hatched', 'where', 'Paul', 'pose', 'Victoria', 'husband', 'day', 'then', 'abandon', 'can', 'save', 'face', 'course', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'out', 'so', 'easily', 'especially', 'when', 'Paul', 'Victoria', 'begin', 'have', 'feelings', 'other', 'Walk', 'Clouds', 'visual', 'relational', 'treat', 'scenery', 'Aragon', 'estate', 'surrounding', 'vineyard', 'almost', 'otherworldly', 'lush', 'beauty', 'hence', 'movie', 'title', 'made', 'want', 'book', 'next', 'flight', 'California', 'wine', 'country', 'even', 'more', 'Sideways', 'did', 'More', 'impressive', 'was', 'close-knit', 'traditional', 'Latino', 'family', 'atmosphere', 'dramatically', 'embodied', 'sensual', 'winemaking', 'ceremony', 'where', 'married', 'women', 'dance', 'newly', 'harvested', 'grapes', 'juice', 'However', 'not', 'perfect', 'paradise', 'Alberto', 'threatened', 'non-traditional', 'daughter', 'Stanford', 'educated', 'son', 'who', 'apply', 'modern', 'business', 'theory', 'old-world', 'winery', 'Gringo', 'Paul', 'focal', 'point', 'insecurities', 'conflict', 'uncertain', 'traumatic', 'resolution.Some', 'have', 'criticized', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'having', 'wooden', 'demeanor', 'True', 'not', 'most', 'expressive', 'performer', 'cinema', 'low-key', 'acting', 'style', 'perfectly', 'character', 'Paul', 'man', 'stoic', 'WWII', 'generation', 'dealing', 'PTSD', 'status', 'orphan', 'was', 'able', 'sympathize', 'root', 'Paul', 'journey', 'commend', 'Mr.', 'Reeves', 'enabling', 'do', 'other', 'actors', 'also', 'turn', 'excellent', 'performances', 'especially', 'late', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'Don', 'Pedro', 'chocolate', 'loving', 'brandy', 'drinking', 'sage', 'patriarch', 'who', 'Paul', 'wing', 'good', 'contrast', 'Giannini', 'driven', 'Alberto', 'so', 'concerned', 'preserving', 'family', 'forgotten', 'how', 'love', 'ca', ""n't"", 'leave', 'out', 'lovely', 'Aitana', 'Sanchez-Gijon', 'passionate', 'intelligent', 'Victoria', 'thinking', 'man', 'movie-character', 'catch', 'Walk', 'Clouds', 'one', 'most', 'romantic', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'up', 'well', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'Highly', 'recommended.WARNING', 'next', 'paragraph', 'SPOILER', 'content', 'concerned', 'moral', 'content', 'want', 'comment', 'Paul', 'character', 'must', 'do', 'so', 'context', 'choice', 'makes.I', 'was', 'surprised', 'gladdened', 'Paul', 'was', 'honorable', 'man', 'who', 'valued', 'family', 'relationships', 'put', 'needs', 'others', 'own', 'desires', ""n't"", 'take', 'easy', 'way', 'albatross', 'wife', 'even', 'finding', 'woman', 'family', 'always', 'longed', 'Paul', 'sexual', 'temptation', 'not', 'dogma', 'Victoria', ""n't"", 'want', 'hurt', 'feelings', 'Victoria', 'loyalty', 'shallow', 'materialistic', 'wife', 'tries', 'work', 'things', 'out', 'kind', 'virtue', 'somewhat', 'rare', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'days', 'welcome', 'old-fashioned', 'family-friendly', 'air', 'movie', 'END', 'OF', 'SPOILER']",A Walk in the Clouds VHS

391256,A2HVL790PBWYTU,6303949436,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","Others deplore this movie as overly sappy and manipulative. I tend to be more charitable. After all, every movie tries its best to pull the strings of its audience, and the issue then is the subtlety at which they go about it. And, yeah, to be frank, A WALK IN THE CLOUDS comes about as subtle as Keanu Reeves' acting. And, yet, that didn't matter to me. I found myself responding to the sweeping romance, the lush cinematography, the rousing score, and the beautiful yearning couple. A WALK IN THE CLOUDS is my fourth favorite Keanu Reeves movie, afterThe Matrix,Speed (Widescreen Edition), andBill & Ted's Excellent Adventure. And it's never dropped the ball as an effective date flick.It's set during the World War II era, so right away you're planted in a place and a time in flux, when sentiment was embraced fully, when life was lived at its fullest, and desperate love stories resonated like mad. After his stint in the military, young war veteran Paul Sutton (Reeves) readjusts to civilian life. Occasionally suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, Paul says goodbye to a wife he's hardly seen and sets off on his humble new job as a traveling salesman of chocolate bon bons. Journeying from Frisco to Sacramento, Paul meets Victoria Aragon, a distressed beautiful girl on her way home from college, and finally the story gets going.Paul Sutton is one of those guys you can count on. He learns that Victoria is in trouble. She is expecting, but has been abandoned by the baby's father, some weasel of a guy. And, now on her way home, she is ashamed and dreads her proud father's displeasure. Now here's the key premise: To save her honor, Paul offers to temporarily pose as Victoria's husband, and she accepts. And, just to emphasize that this is a fable as much as a sumptuous love story, Victoria and Paul are soon gazing down into an idyllic valley kissed lovingly by the sun and with just that hint of mist at the edges (a soul-filling vision you don't much get in real life). Victoria's wealthy family owns and runs a vineyard in Napa, and this valley seems so bountiful and blessed that I have no doubt grapes willingly go there to die.The movie hearkens to those old-time cinematic love stories, and if you buy into it, then you'll have a blast gnashing your teeth as obstacles surface for the star-crossed lovers only for those obstacles to be knocked down, and then only to have further obstacles pop up. The main thorn is Victoria's blustery, suffocating father Alberto Aragon (a very good Giancarlo Giannini). Alberto is highly offended that a) his daughter shows up married without warning and b) that she married a gringo, and a gringo whose vocation is selling candy. Another pretty big deterrent is that Paul is still married, so, really, how far can things go with Victoria? Female viewers have sighed at this unbearable impasse (I know, I've already had to watch this flick a bunch of times with chicks). I did say this was an effective date movie, didn't I?You soak in the story's earthiness and sensuality, and while this isn't quite in the realm of magical realism, there's an echo of that going on. Director Alfonso Arau, who earlier had made the wonderfulLike Water for Chocolate, urges you to lose yourself in the doings onscreen, the images are this evocative. Alfonso Arau even takes an old cornball scene and makes it one of the film's best moments. It's when that old romantic soul, Don Pedro (Anthony Quinn, terrific), coaxes Paul into serenading Victoria underneath her window as she lay sleeping. Paul is drunk but willing and this leads to one of the many grace notes of the film - grace notes, providing that you allow yourself to let go. There's also the grape stomping ritual, which, as performed by Aitana Sanchez-Gijon, somehow turns out a lot sexier than when Lucille Ball did it. But, okay, the scene where everyone heats up the frost-bitten grapes with butterfly wings? That might've been too much.I'm sort of torn between admiring Keanu's simplicity of acting and making fun of his robot-like line delivery. To label Reeves' performance as one-dimensional is to spot him one dimension too many. I get the feeling that, to Keanu, being nuanced means that he should hold off on saying ""whoa"" in a movie. On the other hand, there's a certain level of comfort with that same simplicity of acting. In keeping with its place and period, there's no room for clever cynicism or pop culture snark. That would destroy the old-fashioned romantic mood the film is trying to invoke. A love story like this resorts to old school sensibilities, and that includes requiring the leading man to be a stand-up guy, to be, to use a couple of outdated words, ""gallant"" and ""honorable."" Reeves solidly demonstrates these attributes. Plus, he and Aitana Sanchez-Gijon sizzle in their scenes together.Discounting Keanu, the story is marked with several outstanding performances. Giancarlo Giannini is pretty great as the acerbic, domineering Alberto Aragon, Victoria's dad. Old-timer Anthony Quinn steals every scene with his wise and generous-hearted patriarch, Don Pedro Aragon. But, since I'm a guy, Aitana Sanchez-Gijon, in a rare venture into American pictures, ends up making the most impact. The girl is luminous, and it's a bad blow that she hasn't done much in American cinema before and since. She certainly made a fan out of me. More than anything else, Aitana Sanchez-Gijon is the reason I buy into this sappy movie.",4,How do you see this movie?

Reeves actually looks quite the returning soldier from WWII in his sharp looking uniform. It's his lack of conviction with almost every word he speaks that is the greatest threat to this romantic film. However, from a pure cinematic perspective Reeves does work. What works well for Reeves in a film like SPEED (the unemotional dedicated civil servant) does not exactly work well for him here. At least that was the greatest complaint from the reviewers upon this film's release.The best parts of this film are the scenes showing Reeves returning home from the war and his initial travels by train and then by bus getting back into his civilian sales job. The story that unfolds has a dreamlike quality to it and thus unfolds the romatic tale of love. One of this films greatest strengths is Maurice Jarre's beautiful score. It sounds like he reached way back to some of this classic scores he composed in the 1960s for romantic inspiration.

This young man falls in love with this woman who has been abandoned and who is afraid to go home and face a very strict, unforgiving father.

But of course circumstances occur that cause the stay to go on for a longer period of time and then they are lost in each other.  He however is in a loveless marriage that was jumped into during the war and must be resolved in someway in order to proceed either with the marriage or with the new relationship.  His wife is not really interested in him so he is not sure if she will want to try to make a marriage with him or not.There is nothing earth shaking about this film --- it is just very pleasant to view.

Look to the late Anthony Quinn for a wonderful performance as the benevolent grandfather, who knows true love when he sees it. Look to the beautiful damsel in distress, affectingly played by the lovely Aitana Sanchez-Gijon, with whom Keanu Reeves ultimately falls in love. Look also to the erotic, grape crushing dance and the idyllic cinematography. Overlook the ridiculous ending scene where one is almost embarrassed for Giancarlo Giannini and the rest of the cast. If you do all this, you will probably enjoy the film.The movie plot is simple. World War II veteran returns home to the woman whom he had married just before he left to go to war. You get a sense of what is to come, when she is not at the dock to meet him, as he arrives after a four year sojourn. Puzzled, he goes home and finds her there, and you have to wonder what he ever saw in this dolt, notwithstanding her lovely figure. She seems totally uninterested in him as a person. She never even bothered to read the almost daily letters he sent her, which is why she never even knew he was coming home.He goes off to his former job, that of a traveling chocolate salesman, even though it is clearly not something he wishes to do. While on his journey, he meets a beautiful woman named Victoria, who has a problem. You see, she is pregnant by a man who does not wish to commit himself, and she is on her way home to her close knit family in the idyllic Napa Valley. She is terrified of telling her very old fashioned father, played by Giancarlo Giannini, of her situation and is weeping copious buckets of tears over the expected confrontation. What does Keanu do? Why he suggests going home with her and posing as her husband, while she breaks the news to her family of her purported marriage to Keanu and her pregnancy. Once this is done, Keanu will ostensibly desert her and go on his merry way.Of course, all the best laid plans often go awry, and this is no exception. They fall in love. Even though he could, he refuses to take advantage of her sexually, because another woman, his wife, has a claim on him. You gotta love this guy! He tries to leave a number of times, but is initially unsuccessful. It is clear that he would prefer to stay. When he finally leaves and returns to his so called wife, he gets a not so unwelcome surprise. A surprise that guarantees that all will be well in the end.

(Boy, I'm gonna pay for that!) So I don't see why so many people label Keanu Reeves as being ""wooden"". OK, so he's not well-known for the romantic movies (unlike a Mr Grant), he's normally disabling bombs, or trying to figure out whether he is The One.This film is definitely one of his best. Everyone else has gone through the storyline on this, so I won't! I will say Keanu looks great in a uniform, and does what Bruce Willis for little white vests - yummy!The scenery is absolutely breath-taking in this movie, as is Keanu - OK, sorry, I had to slip that in!!!A pre-Will & Grace Debra Messing stars in this, as Paul's wife, Betty. During a friendly game of hockey with his friends during spare time, Keanu's lip was split, requiring six stitches (which must have been a pain for the director), and a kiss from Debra Messing in a scene, he had to tell her not to hurt him!Aitana S&aacute;nchez-Gij&oacute;n plays the beautiful Victoria Arag&oacute;n, although there's several unnoticed continuity problems, as her hair seems to go from wavy to straight every couple of scenes! This is her first mainstream, and she hasn't appeared in a lot of other mainstream movies.

391306,A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ,6303949436,Robert Blake,"[1, 1]","There are those who may attack ""A Walk In The Clouds"" for the fantasy-like nature of it's storytelling, for the dreamy quality it creates, for simply being, well, unreal. But do most people honestly go to the movies for depressingly real reminders of how cynical and sad the world is? Of course not! We go to the movies for escape, hoping the film we are about to view will pluck our hearts or exhilarate us. ""A Walk In The Clouds"" is a beautifully-done film, the kind that lets us escape and dream, fantasize and smile. It looks gorgeous, director Alfonso Arau films in a landscape that seems more like a painting than a real place. The story is basically a modern fairy tale that takes place in a California vineyard soon after WW2. It seems so unreal, but real at the same time because it basically crystalizes that which we call ""romance."" There are sequences of great beauty, as when the vineyard occupants try to heat frozen vines with giant butterfly-like wings or a scene where grapes are crushed by dancing. These scenes are fun and enticing, but also hypnotic, especially with Maurice Jarre's soaring music which sounds like classic Mexican flavors decorated with orchestral elegance. Okay, so maybe some us find the realities of our world a little too gloomy to ever believe in this kind of hokey romantic stuff, but why can't we hope for an instant? ""A Walk In The Clouds"" gives us hope, it entertains, it tells a good story. Corny applies more to those who attack the film, they obviously have sour, boring minds and wouldn't know a romantic idea even if it kissed them right in the lips.

Gorgeous scenery dominated by vineyards, the perfect nestle for a romantic fairy tale...Everything comes from the heart in this rich heartwarming film... Arau's vision and dream was to build a tunnel between what we know and don't know about two-spirited people, the roots and blood-ties of a family, its traditional values, and its attachment to the earth...Arau reinforces the borders of tradition in the Mexican aristocratic family who have lived on American soil for generations, describing her fundamental values: family solidarity, religious commitment, and cooperation with the land and nature... His motion picture derives its emotional power not only from the sweet love that blossoms between Paul and Victoria, but from the unconditional familial love that the young GI encounters while at her hacienda... Each type of love is strengthened through the knowledge that one leads to the other...Keanu Reeves plays the quiet expressive dreamer who finds the traditional values in a magical place... He is a genteel seller of chocolate candy who, en route on a train from San Francisco to Sacramento, meets a graduate student in crisis... He learns that she is frightened to return home because she is pregnant and unmarried...To protect Victoria from her father's wrath, and ignoring obviously the outcome, Paul tells Victoria that he believes ""there's a perfect someone for everyone - someone who'll love you no matter what."" He gallantly insists in posing as her husband just for one night...Making her American film debut, Aitana Sanchez-Gijon plays the strong, exquisite woman 'so easy to love'... Victoria has been seduced and abandoned by a 'free spirit.' She is now on her way to her wine-growing family in Napa Valley to help with the annual grape harvest...While her silken butterfly big wings spread the heated air around the frozen grapes, Victoria's sight was enough to engulf Paul with desire... And when her dark hair tumbled down to him, Paul's face was burnt by the harshness of actually having been able to feel some part of her... This burning has been caused by something as soft and luscious as her beautiful black hair... It is simply Arau's shot of her luminous figure, that discreetly heightened her feminine mystique, and her strong sensuality...The legendary Anthony Quinn, a two-time Academy Award-winner for ""Viva Zapata"" and ""Lust for Life,"" is the wise patriarch, Don Pedro who tries to intensify the romance between Paul Sutton and Victoria, while her father tries his best to show his displeasure at her choice... While chomping Paul's chocolates, the sagacious old man shows the polite soldier the root from which the entire vineyard has grown, and instructs him the traditions and beliefs of his ultra-conservative family...Screen veteran Giancarlo Giannini (who received an Oscar nomination for his performance in ""Seven Beauties""), plays the proud, suspicious, ultra-traditional father, whose beliefs are deeply rooted in tradition: 'My daughter can trace her roots back 400 years to the best families in Mexico,' he affirms... As a strong believer in the importance of family, Don Alberto Arag&oacute;n reacts violently to the prospect of his beloved daughter already married to someone who has nothing... No family. No past. No future!If you want to be moved by a consummate screen composer, and enjoy a wonderful family dinner... If you want to watch Reeves and Quinn singing and getting drunk... If you want to observe joyous women rolling around in a tub of emerald green grapes, keeping pace with the help of musicians...

391312,A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB,6303949436,"Sarah ""Eat Dessert First""","[0, 0]","Alfonso Arau (Like Water For Chocolate)'s WWII romance A Walk in the Clouds, based on the 1942 Italian film Quattro passi fra le nuvole, explores the intertwined notions of destiny and true love amidst a sprawling vineyard. Paul Sutton (Keanu Reeves) returns home from the front to discover that the woman he married shortly before shipping out (a cameo by Debra Messing fromWill & Grace - Season One) isn't the woman he wants to spend his life with; she couldn't handle the realities of war, so she saved his heartfelt letters without reading them.Before the war, he was a chocolate salesman, but he is dissatisfied with civilian life and suffers from PTSD. Aboard a train, he meets Victoria (Aitana S&aacute;nchez-Gij&oacute;n), a beautiful woman traveling alone. She was pursuing her master's degree in literature, but became pregnant. Victoria has nowhere to go but home to her domineering father Alberto and his winery, and Paul offers to be her ""husband"" to make her pregnancy appear legitimate to her family. Once at the vineyard, Paul is convinced by Don Pedro (Anthony Quinn, apparently reprising his role inZorba the Greek) to stay and help with the yearly harvest. Paul gradually becomes accepted by Victoria's very traditional Mexican family, and pitches in to help with the backbreaking labor involved in maintaining the vineyard.Perhaps the greatest tragedy is the waste of what could have been: the romance is strictly by-the-numbers, and Keanu's painfully wooden delivery (he redefines the word ""monotone"") does little to soften already formulaic dialogue. Painful drunken serenades featuring Reeves and Quinn, an absurdly shot ""flap like a butterfly"" sequence, and hokey harvest montages featuring a choir chanting ""crush the grapes"" do little to cleanse the palette. However, the gorgeous twilight shots of Napa Valley (filmed on location at various wineries including Beringer, Duckhorn, Haywood, Mount Vedeer, and Mayacamus) are pure sun-drenched bliss. It's a shame that the script doesn't hold up as well. As with many modern remakes of foreign films such as the recentNo Reservationsbased onMostly Martha, the producers would have done well to study the source material more closely; the charm and wit that made these films classics in their original languages are lost in translation trying to produce a product geared towards American audiences. A Walk in the Clouds lacks the sensuality and mysticism of Arau's captivating Mexican fableLike Water for Chocolate, or even the AmericanChocolat (Miramax Collector's Series). If you enjoyed Like Water for Chocolate, then you will likely find some redeeming qualities in A Walk in the Clouds, but for everyone else, I'd recommend a different vintage.",3,Formulaic romance starring...Napa Valley,1211673600,"05 25, 2008",2008,2721,"['Alfonso', 'Arau', 'Water', 'Chocolate', 'WWII', 'romance', 'A', 'Walk', 'Clouds', 'based', '1942', 'Italian', 'film', 'Quattro', 'passi', 'fra', 'le', 'nuvole', 'intertwined', 'notions', 'destiny', 'true', 'love', 'amidst', 'sprawling', 'vineyard', 'Paul', 'Sutton', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'home', 'front', 'discover', 'woman', 'married', 'shortly', 'shipping', 'out', 'cameo', 'Debra', 'Messing', 'fromWill', 'Grace', 'Season', 'One', ""n't"", 'woman', 'spend', 'life', 'could', ""n't"", 'handle', 'realities', 'war', 'saved', 'heartfelt', 'letters', 'reading', 'war', 'was', 'chocolate', 'salesman', 'dissatisfied', 'civilian', 'life', 'suffers', 'PTSD', 'train', 'Victoria', 'Aitana', 'S', 'aacute', 'nchez-Gij', 'oacute', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'traveling', 'alone', 'was', 'pursuing', 'master', 'degree', 'literature', 'became', 'pregnant', 'Victoria', 'nowhere', 'go', 'home', 'domineering', 'father', 'Alberto', 'winery', 'Paul', 'be', 'husband', 'make', 'pregnancy', 'appear', 'legitimate', 'family', 'Once', 'vineyard', 'Paul', 'convinced', 'Don', 'Pedro', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'apparently', 'reprising', 'role', 'Greek', 'stay', 'help', 'yearly', 'harvest', 'Paul', 'gradually', 'becomes', 'accepted', 'Victoria', 'very', 'traditional', 'Mexican', 'family', 'pitches', 'help', 'backbreaking', 'labor', 'involved', 'maintaining', 'vineyard.Perhaps', 'greatest', 'tragedy', 'waste', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'romance', 'strictly', 'by-the-numbers', 'Keanu', 'painfully', 'wooden', 'delivery', 'word', 'monotone', 'little', 'soften', 'already', 'formulaic', 'dialogue', 'Painful', 'drunken', 'serenades', 'featuring', 'Reeves', 'Quinn', 'absurdly', 'shot', 'flap', 'butterfly', 'sequence', 'hokey', 'harvest', 'montages', 'featuring', 'choir', 'chanting', 'crush', 'grapes', 'do', 'little', 'cleanse', 'palette', 'However', 'gorgeous', 'twilight', 'shots', 'Napa', 'Valley', 'filmed', 'location', 'various', 'wineries', 'including', 'Beringer', 'Duckhorn', 'Haywood', 'Mount', 'Vedeer', 'Mayacamus', 'are', 'pure', 'sun-drenched', 'bliss', 'shame', 'script', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'modern', 'remakes', 'foreign', 'films', 'such', 'recentNo', 'Reservationsbased', 'onMostly', 'Martha', 'producers', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'well', 'study', 'source', 'material', 'more', 'closely', 'charm', 'wit', 'made', 'films', 'classics', 'original', 'languages', 'are', 'lost', 'translation', 'trying', 'produce', 'product', 'geared', 'towards', 'American', 'audiences', 'Walk', 'Clouds', 'sensuality', 'mysticism', 'Arau', 'captivating', 'Mexican', 'fableLike', 'Water', 'Chocolate', 'even', 'AmericanChocolat', 'Miramax', 'Collector', 'Series', 'enjoyed', 'Water', 'Chocolate', 'then', 'will', 'likely', 'find', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'Walk', 'Clouds', 'everyone', 'else', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'different', 'vintage']",A Walk in the Clouds VHS
