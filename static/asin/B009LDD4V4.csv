1598639,A20IIR0422G3A5,B009LDD4V4,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[3, 5]","In this season, Booth and Bones have settled in to their new relationship, living together, still unmarried, but in love. Join with that a new twist in the Sweets / Daisy relationship (trying to avoid spoilers) a new relationship for Cam, and new emphasis on Hodgins and Angela, with their daughter. All of this would seem to make a better rounded story setting. I always thought one of the great virtues of the series ""Numb3rs"" was that it had three centers of gravity, the FBI office, the University, and the Eppes home. That solution to the ""Three Body Problem"" was set in place from the start. With Bones, it is not as effective, except that it has renewed the Brennan / Booth / Sweets dynamic which was fresh when Sweets was added to the show. In fact, in general, Sweets character is the one which has grown the most. The most exciting non-forensic arc in the story is Cam's new relation.The opening episode, which resolved the cliff hanger from Season Seven was done very nicely. ""Bones"" often has very good transitions from season to season. But after resolving the Christopher Pelant arc at the end of the first episode, the story line is left dangling, except by a puzzling piece of action involving Reed Diamond, the FBI agent who takes over the Pelant case from Booth. Most of the episodes from 2 through 21 seem relatively routine, with few case based connections between episodes.Like Ian Edgerton's appearances on Numb3rs, the story is always enlivened when certain guest actors appear, such as Cindi Lauper, and especially Patricia Belcher, as Miss Caroline Julian, the Federal prosecutor, who more often than not is the one who gets our heroes out of a jam. On piece of business, Bones naivet&eacute; about many commonsensical things, which the average person takes for granted, is wearing thin, like Ziva David's constantly misspeaking American idioms on NCIS. One would expect a person of her intelligence would be smart enough to dumb down her small talk. But she doesn't, irritating Booth, especially regarding religion.I have never been especially fond of the Bones recurring villains. They don't seem entirely human. They are held at arm's length, not like the pair, Buck Winters and Crystal Hoyle in a two part arc in Numb3rs (first and second episodes in the 3rd season.) Booth continues to be the best all around character, with Camille Saroyan a close second. I would rate this season just a bit less interesting than the second season, and seasons 5 - 7.

Thurlow,"[100, 104]","The air might have gone out of this series after forensic anthropologist Dr. Temperance ""Bones"" Brennan and FBI special agent Seeley Booth finally became a couple with a child last season.  Happily for fans, the show has found new ways to keep things interesting and fun.The end of the seventh season of ""Bones"" left Bones on the run with her infant child after being framed for murder by the highly skilled serial killer Christopher Pelant.  The opening of the eighth season finds Booth and her colleagues at the Jeffersonian Institute trying to clear her name.  Fortunately for the series, they succeed, although Pelant eludes justice to pose a future threat.This eighth season continues to feature crime-of-the-week murders for Bones, Booth, and the Jeffersonian lab rats to solve through clever forensics and Booth's old-fashioned police work.  One of the most interesting episodes is told through the eyes of the murder victim, with the assistance of a psychic (a well-cast Cindy Lauper).  Another standout episode involves a group effort to resolve a cold case whose victim turns out to be a forgotten hero of the 9/11 attack on the Pentagon.Outside the lab, Bones has an uncomfortable but touching period of readjustment to living with Booth, after her time on the run.  Her changed perspective will lead to some of the most interesting conversations as she and Booth commute to crime scenes.  Just to complicate things, staff psychiatrist Dr. Sweets will temporarily move in with the couple right after he breaks up with girlfriend Daisy, a technician in the lab.  Series regulars Angela and Hodgins will have their own challenges as working parents.  The continuing parade of interns through the Jeffersonian crime lab will feature in several episodes, and one of them will become a surprising emotional complication for Dr. Saroyan.  Christopher Pelant will return to menace the team in a gut-wrenching season finale.Tune in for the fun and crime-solving of the eighth and perhaps final season of Bones; highly recommended to its fans.",5,Reaching for a new level...,1356652800,"12 28, 2012",2012,2045,"['air', 'might', 'have', 'gone', 'out', 'series', 'forensic', 'anthropologist', 'Dr.', 'Temperance', 'Bones', 'Brennan', 'FBI', 'special', 'agent', 'Seeley', 'Booth', 'finally', 'became', 'couple', 'child', 'last', 'season', 'Happily', 'fans', 'show', 'found', 'new', 'ways', 'keep', 'things', 'interesting', 'fun.The', 'end', 'seventh', 'season', 'Bones', 'left', 'Bones', 'run', 'infant', 'child', 'being', 'framed', 'murder', 'highly', 'skilled', 'serial', 'killer', 'Christopher', 'Pelant', 'opening', 'eighth', 'season', 'Booth', 'colleagues', 'Jeffersonian', 'Institute', 'trying', 'clear', 'name', 'Fortunately', 'series', 'succeed', 'Pelant', 'justice', 'pose', 'future', 'threat.This', 'eighth', 'season', 'feature', 'crime-of-the-week', 'murders', 'Bones', 'Booth', 'Jeffersonian', 'lab', 'rats', 'solve', 'clever', 'forensics', 'Booth', 'old-fashioned', 'police', 'work', 'One', 'most', 'interesting', 'episodes', 'told', 'eyes', 'murder', 'victim', 'assistance', 'psychic', 'well-cast', 'Cindy', 'Lauper', 'standout', 'episode', 'group', 'effort', 'resolve', 'cold', 'case', 'victim', 'out', 'be', 'forgotten', 'hero', '9/11', 'attack', 'Pentagon.Outside', 'lab', 'Bones', 'uncomfortable', 'touching', 'period', 'readjustment', 'living', 'Booth', 'time', 'run', 'changed', 'perspective', 'will', 'lead', 'most', 'interesting', 'conversations', 'Booth', 'commute', 'crime', 'scenes', 'Just', 'complicate', 'things', 'staff', 'psychiatrist', 'Dr.', 'Sweets', 'will', 'temporarily', 'move', 'couple', 'right', 'up', 'girlfriend', 'Daisy', 'technician', 'lab', 'Series', 'Angela', 'Hodgins', 'will', 'have', 'own', 'challenges', 'working', 'parents', 'continuing', 'parade', 'interns', 'Jeffersonian', 'crime', 'lab', 'will', 'feature', 'several', 'episodes', 'one', 'will', 'become', 'surprising', 'emotional', 'complication', 'Dr.', 'Saroyan', 'Christopher', 'Pelant', 'will', 'return', 'menace', 'team', 'gut-wrenching', 'season', 'finale.Tune', 'fun', 'crime-solving', 'eighth', 'perhaps', 'final', 'season', 'Bones', 'highly', 'recommended', 'fans']",N/A

1598659,A2F9Z5HADIG6R3,B009LDD4V4,"G. Snyder ""gads00""","[21, 22]","One of the things I liked most about ""Bones"" was that each season was pretty much self-contained. There were story arcs that spanned multiple episodes through the season (such as the Gravedigger and Gormogon storylines) and ongoing plot developments (such as the truth about Brennan's parents and Hodgins' and Angela's developing relationship) but by and large each season wrapped up the loose ends by or in the season finale. Unfortunately, that pattern has been broken with the introduction of Christopher Pelant. While I realize that the forensics team members require a challenge equal to their considerable abilities to keep the show interesting, some of Pelant's technological feats are, quite frankly, ridiculous and highly contrived. That, however, isn't the true problem with the concept. Pelant (much as Red John in ""The Mentalist"") is a loose end whom the writers have allowed to remain one step ahead of the protagonists and can continue to do so indefinitely. Eventually it gets tedious to sit through yet another Pelant episode knowing that, regardless of how brilliantly Booth, Brennan, and the squints work through the evidence and close in, the writers can and probably will reveal that it was yet another manipulative ploy by Pelant who had complete knowledge of what everyone was up to all along by spying on them through clock radios, microwave ovens, and other networked appliances and so could circumvent their efforts. Undoubtedly Pelant eventually will be brought to justice. The only extremely irksome question about that is how long the writers intend to milk the situation.That said, the chemistry between Boreanaz and Deschanel remains as engaging as ever, and the humor (dark and morbid as it sometimes is) helps to keep the series fresh and well worth watching on the whole.",4,The dreaded never-ending storyline,1380326400,"09 28, 2013",2013,1804,"['One', 'things', 'liked', 'most', 'Bones', 'was', 'season', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'self-contained', 'were', 'story', 'arcs', 'spanned', 'multiple', 'episodes', 'season', 'such', 'Gravedigger', 'Gormogon', 'storylines', 'ongoing', 'plot', 'developments', 'such', 'truth', 'Brennan', 'parents', 'Hodgins', 'Angela', 'developing', 'relationship', 'large', 'season', 'wrapped', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'season', 'finale', 'Unfortunately', 'pattern', 'been', 'broken', 'introduction', 'Christopher', 'Pelant', 'realize', 'forensics', 'team', 'members', 'require', 'challenge', 'equal', 'considerable', 'abilities', 'keep', 'show', 'interesting', 'Pelant', 'technological', 'feats', 'are', 'quite', 'frankly', 'ridiculous', 'highly', 'contrived', 'however', ""n't"", 'true', 'problem', 'concept', 'Pelant', 'much', 'Red', 'John', 'Mentalist', 'loose', 'end', 'whom', 'writers', 'have', 'allowed', 'remain', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'protagonists', 'can', 'continue', 'do', 'so', 'indefinitely', 'Eventually', 'tedious', 'sit', 'yet', 'Pelant', 'episode', 'knowing', 'regardless', 'how', 'brilliantly', 'Booth', 'Brennan', 'squints', 'work', 'evidence', 'close', 'writers', 'can', 'probably', 'will', 'reveal', 'was', 'yet', 'manipulative', 'ploy', 'Pelant', 'who', 'had', 'complete', 'knowledge', 'what', 'everyone', 'was', 'up', 'spying', 'clock', 'radios', 'microwave', 'ovens', 'other', 'networked', 'appliances', 'so', 'could', 'circumvent', 'efforts', 'Undoubtedly', 'Pelant', 'eventually', 'will', 'be', 'brought', 'justice', 'only', 'extremely', 'irksome', 'question', 'how', 'long', 'writers', 'intend', 'milk', 'situation.That', 'said', 'chemistry', 'Boreanaz', 'Deschanel', 'as', 'engaging', 'ever', 'humor', 'dark', 'morbid', 'keep', 'series', 'fresh', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'whole']",N/A

1598662,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B009LDD4V4,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 1]","This season should become a turning point in this series if they hear the voices in the wings.First they need a unifying Element that brings the various episodes together instead of having a series of independent and autonomous episodes. They have been trying in different ways. First of all they bring in a nasty criminal who is trying to frame and then destroy every single member of the team for various reasons. This chap, Christopher Pelant, is a hi-tech genius and he is using the surveillance networks the recent NSA scandal has revealed to take over the whole society via the famous cloud over our heads. If it is possible for NSA to do it, it has to be possible for anyone who has the technological know how and equipment. Ask Snowden if you do not believe it. But this link remains too loose so far and it only comes into the picture a very few times, particularly in the opening and closing episodes but that is not enough to coalesce the various episodes into some kind of saga.Then they develop, overdevelop actually, the personal levels, i.e. the personal and sentimental relations between the various members of the team and the interns. That is interesting but it has little to do at times with the story, with the episodes. It is even at times rather mushy on the whole and sentimentalese. There is a lot to do in this line but not as a flavoring, rather as a real dynamic element of the story line, of the plot.The third element is some kind of societal approach of these crimes and these criminals but the series avoids, systematically according to me, the political level and hence the political criticism that should be developed against this society that is trying to take over all our freedoms and that more or less consider everyone as a potential criminal which then leads to the development of fear, unease and even discontent that leads in its turn to defensive or protective if not criminal activities against this Big Brother. This discourse is always present in the back of the most distant wings but the series itself avoids it.In the same way the series that is dealing with hi-tech in the field of laboratory, health and other medical or biological sciences and practices. We could expect that here too the series developed a discourse that is never even approached though the series is dealing with it all the time: the danger this scientific and technological development contains in itself: the fact that it may lead the human species to a development that will have little to do with humanity. There is a lot to say about the imminent and extreme dangers this development can represent for our future as individuals, as free individuals and as a species. Machines that are going to be &#8211; so they say &#8211; more intelligent than men in 2050 will not need men any more and will get rid of these human animals and then they will establish a mechanical market economy without any buying public. The future is brilliant for a customer society without consumers. Brilliant Doctor Watson, brilliant! This series could really touch the problem from time to time.The last element is the criticism against the market economy itself that can be hijacked into becoming a tremendous source of power and money for some who can manipulate this market economy to their advantage by using technology and medical or biological sciences to create some economic opportunities, including for a cure to a disease they spread themselves. This is approached in one episode particularly, &#8220;The Pathos of the Pathogens&#8221; but that is rather limited in effect because it is an isolated case.The final criticism that is coming up in the series itself is the general attitude and tone of Bones herself, of Temperance who is a complete misnomer. She is not in anyway temporal, temperate or tempered with other people. She is excessive in all possible ways even abiusive. She bludgeons people with her knowledge, her science as if it were some aggressive object for some personal if not umbilical self-satisfied blunt force trauma imposed onto the contendents around her who should know better than question her judgment. She is vain and her science does not justify her humdrum and crushing tone all the time. In this season this came under fire in several episodes from various characters but will they be able to make her mature slightly so that she gets rid of this tone and starts feeling empathy for other people? So far they satisfied themselves with having her apologize in the worst cases of blunt scientific abuse to colleagues or bystanders.Of course the bodies are gross, the bones are all broken and manhandled and the criminals are predictable most of the time and then the whole interest is to find out how they are going to be trapped with science and once or twice with bluffing situational pressure if not duress.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",4,Seasons and series must be much more unified by the plot,1386201600,"12 5, 2013",2013,4874,"['season', 'should', 'become', 'turning', 'point', 'series',

I do not watch much commercial TV but this is an exception.  The programs include humour, some SCI FI, crime fighting, tear jerking scenes and sentimental stuff, all of which I like. Some splendidepisodes I especially liked: THE FUTURE IN THE PAST, THE BUT IN THE JOKE, THE GHOST IN THE MACHINE, THE CORPSE IN THE CANOPY, THE SHOT IN THE DARK, & especially THE DIAMOND IN  THE ROUGH where Booth and Brennan do a magnificent dance at the end of the episode.  Emily Deschanel has to be one of themost beautiful women in the world, along with her wonderful sister Zooey.  The GHOST episode was very mystical along with the SHOT IN THE  DARK whereBrennan meets her mother.  Was it real or a figment of her mind? It was ironic that an atheist gave birth to her child in a Manger. (Accident?) Added the wonderful photography, sets and outstanding direction and this overall was (and is) the best program on TV.  I did not like the idea of Sweets moving into Booths and Brennans house.  I don't really care for him: He is like a man-child, constantly putting his foot in his mouth and comes off as a kind of mooch.  I wonder if his primary role is to be comedy relief along with Edison and Daisy whom I also dislike.  I understand thatDaley is primarily a writer: he should stick to that.  I heard he wrote for Jim Carey, another looser, whose only claim to fame is his big mouth.  Edison I don't like primarily because he made a number of inappropriate remarks about Brennans chest during her pregnancy and on serveral occasions.  I did not think it was funny; almost stereotyping Edison.  I bought the episodes for SEASON 8 from AMAZON into a video library; I hope however the DVD set is released soon.  I have the complete 1 thru 7 seasons that I purchased thru AMAZON and watch them often. There was supposed to be four moreepisodes to make up for the shortened 7th season: where are they?

However, the first episode of Season 8 brings them home to Agent Seeley Booth (David Boreanaz), as Brennan's expertise is needed in discovering the killer of a high school guidance counselor.Unfortunately, Pelant continues to terrorize the Jeffersonian team, taunting them with murders they cannot pinpoint on him, as well as sabotaging their bank accounts, keeping them under constant surveillance and otherwise taking over their lives.Other key episodes include &#34;The Method in the Madness,&#34; where Sweets moves in with Booth and Brennan; and &#34;The Patriot in Purgatory,&#34; where the team struggles to learn whether a man who died in 9/11 was a victim or in fact a perpetrator.In &#34;The Bod in the Pod,&#34; the team learns about Cam's new secret romance; and in &#34;The Diamond in the Rough,&#34; Booth and Brennan go undercover in a dance competition.Some supernatural elements come into play in &#34;The Shot in the Dark,&#34; when Brennan is shot and nearly dies, causing her to visit with her long-dead mother. The question is, did she really speak to her mother or simply dream it?In &#34;The Fact in the Fiction,&#34; viewers meet a new intern, Dr. Oliver Wells, as smart as the other squinterns yet impossibly obnoxious and difficult to deal with.Finally, Booth has a shock in &#34;The Party in the Pants,&#34; when he reunites with his mother (Joanna Cassidy) after over twenty years' separation and must come to grips with the circumstances that caused her to leave him and his brother Jared as children.As usual, this season provides viewers with a satisfying mix of intriguing cases and personal situations, especially now that Booth and Brennan have a young daughter.

Then there was the dreaded 1/2 season, Season 7, which introduced a character who turns computers into magic boxes, and the main characters into irrational drooling idiots. Unfortunately, he's back, in three of the episodes, doing even more things that are technologically impossible. But that's not the worst that the writers inflicted on Season 8. No, there was one episode filmed from the perspective of a skull haunted by the ghost of its previous inhabitant (and Cindy Lauper's ""Psychic"" character shows up to be his interpreter), and worse still, Brennan gets to have a series of near-death experiments and meets her mother in near-heaven. Yeah. Really. That bad. Worse. If anything, my short description probably conjures better stories in your mind that the garbage spouted out on the screen. Season 8 is a killer. This show, since it won't be allowed to go back to being about the science (or near science, or plausible science fiction), should be cancelled. It is time for it to go to bed, or be euthanized.Sadly, Season 9 is already being broadcast, and will undoubtedly have even more of the over-the-top genius so smart he can make the computer into a magic box with faery powder so it can do the impossible. So smart, that the FBI doesn't even bother to attempt to figure out how he hacked into their ""secure"" systems so they can block him (and other people) out.

If you don't like it, this season will not do anything to change your mind because it really follows the same formula as it has the past few years.I think the stories are still compelling and interesting enough to keep the show fun to watch. It does a good job of blending the case of the week stories with the ongoing story arcs. The main antagonist this season continues to be Pelant. The storyline from the last season which resulted in the end of the season cliffhanger is resolved quickly in Season 8. Pelant however keeps coming back throughout the season to make the lives of the team hell.The show has kept the rotating interns that stemmed from the one story line from the show whose outcome I did not like, and that was having Zach written off the show. The show does a good job of actually giving them more to do that just being Brennan's sidekicks and it seems like the show is going to stick with that format for the foreseeable future.Aside from the stretches that the show makes with reality which you either accept or not, the only thing that was completely unrealistic from this season was about Hodgins money. You have to suspend your disbelief for what happens initially, but I personally think the directon the show takes the aftermath is just dumb.The rest of the season really revolves around Booth and Brennan as a couple, and as parents. I think that part of the story is well written and has done a good job of not making the relationship stale which is always the danger in bringing lead characters into a relationship.For those who get the blu ray set, there are deleted scenes and commentary on some episodes, an &#34;Ask Bones&#34; feature where cast members answer questions submitted by fans, a short ultimate fan segment and a gag reel. Not a ton of extras but enough there if you do like going through that material. Also, the blu rays allow you to play it in season mode, so you can stop at any point and pick back up where you left off.",5,Still going strong,1382140800,"10 19, 2013",2013,2110,"['Chances', 'are', 'now', 'know', 'how', 'feel', 'Bones', 'have', 'liked', 'show', 'up', 'point', 'will', 'likely', 'still', 'enjoy', 'season', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'season', 'will', 'not', 'do', 'anything', 'change', 'mind', 'really', 'same', 'formula', 'past', 'few', 'years.I', 'think', 'stories', 'are', 'still', 'compelling', 'interesting', 'enough', 'keep', 'show', 'fun', 'watch', 'good', 'job', 'blending', 'case', 'week', 'stories', 'ongoing', 'story', 'arcs', 'main', 'antagonist', 'season', 'be', 'Pelant', 'storyline', 'last', 'season', 'resulted', 'end', 'season', 'cliffhanger', 'resolved', 'quickly', 'Season', '8', 'Pelant', 'however', 'coming', 'back', 'season', 'make', 'lives', 'team', 'hell.The', 'show', 'kept', 'rotating', 'interns', 'stemmed', 'one', 'story', 'line', 'show', 'outcome', 'did', 'not', 'was', 'having', 'Zach', 'written', 'off', 'show', 'show', 'good', 'job', 'actually', 'giving', 'more', 'do', 'just', 'being', 'Brennan', 'sidekicks', 'show', 'going', 'stick', 'format', 'foreseeable', 'future.Aside', 'stretches', 'show', 'reality', 'either', 'accept', 'not', 'only', 'thing', 'was', 'completely', 'unrealistic', 'season', 'was', 'Hodgins', 'money', 'have', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'what', 'initially', 'personally', 'think', 'directon', 'show', 'aftermath', 'just', 'dumb.The', 'rest', 'season', 'really', 'Booth', 'Brennan', 'couple', 'parents', 'think', 'part', 'story', 'well', 'written', 'done', 'good', 'job', 'not', 'making', 'relationship', 'stale', 'always', 'danger', 'bringing', 'lead', 'characters', 'relationship.For', 'who', 'get', 'blu', 'ray', 'set', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'commentary', 'episodes', '34', 'Ask', 'Bones', '34', 'feature', 'where', 'cast', 'members', 'answer', 'questions', 'submitted', 'fans', 'short', 'ultimate', 'fan', 'segment', 'gag', 'reel', 'Not', 'ton', 'extras', 'enough', 'there', 'do', 'going', 'material', 'Also', 'blu', 'allow', 'play', 'season', 'mode', 'can', 'stop', 'point', 'pick', 'back', 'up', 'where', 'left', 'off']",N/A
