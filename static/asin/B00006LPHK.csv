Crabtree ""Doc Crabtree""","[0, 4]","When Belgium granted the Congo independence in 1960 it ended a period of colonization which saw the huge territory ruthlessly exploited (at least during the first decades of European rule) and badly prepared for self-rule (Belgium maintained the civil service and the gendarme was officered solely by Belgians). Once independance was granted the Congolese attempted to run this huge country, which was as big as western Europe, with few educated people and no previous experience at democracy. This film looks at the short administration of Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba, who tried to lead the country during the first few months.One of the things I liked about this film was the way the director was able to get the ""feel"" of the period... first-rate locations shots and period costumes really establish this film in the early 1960s. And the performances by the actors were very good as well. However, the film did little to explain the events which led up to Lumumba's overthrow and the subsequent civil war. Indeed, the MNC (Lumumba's party) made a lot of promises to the populace which could not possibly be met. In one scene several Congolese soldiers appeal to Lumumba prior to elections to improve their lot. Later, soldiers break into a cabinet meeting AFTER independence and demand the removal of Belgian officers, promotions, etc. The fact was that the Force Publique had been undermined by the promises of politicians (Lumumba among them) and that this collapse had ripple effects which would be felt long after Lumumba was gone. It was no coincidence that the strongman who emerged was Mobutu, who was able to rebuild the Force Publique as a national army, the ANC. When an impasse developed between Lumumba and President Kasa-Vubu Mobutu was the the only agent of order in the Congo. He became dictator of the Congo through 1997.The director clearly wants you to believe that Lumumba was better than that, but if he did not become a dictator (as happened in virtually all of the newly-independent African states) he would have been bucking the trend. No elected president of this period ever stepped down voluntarily or stood for reelection. He was also a leftist, which is undeniable, and was certainly leaning towards having a Soviet presence in his country when he was removed from office. Still, as the story of a man who was in over his head, it is a good movie.",4,A man in over his head.,1334707200,"04 18, 2012",2012,2381,"['When', 'Belgium', 'granted', 'Congo', 'independence', '1960', 'ended', 'period', 'colonization', 'saw', 'huge', 'territory', 'ruthlessly', 'exploited', 'least', 'first', 'decades', 'European', 'rule', 'badly', 'prepared', 'self-rule', 'Belgium', 'maintained', 'civil', 'service', 'gendarme', 'was', 'officered', 'solely', 'Belgians', 'Once', 'independance', 'was', 'granted', 'Congolese', 'attempted', 'run', 'huge', 'country', 'was', 'as', 'big', 'western', 'Europe', 'few', 'educated', 'people', 'previous', 'experience', 'democracy', 'film', 'short', 'administration', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Patrice', 'Lumumba', 'who', 'tried', 'lead', 'country', 'first', 'few', 'months.One', 'things', 'liked', 'film', 'was', 'way', 'director', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'feel', 'period', 'first-rate', 'locations', 'shots', 'period', 'costumes', 'really', 'establish', 'film', 'early', '1960s', 'performances', 'actors', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'well', 'However', 'film', 'did', 'little', 'explain', 'events', 'led', 'up', 'Lumumba', 'overthrow', 'subsequent', 'civil', 'war', 'Indeed', 'MNC', 'Lumumba', 'party', 'made', 'lot', 'promises', 'populace', 'could', 'not', 'possibly', 'be', 'met', 'one', 'scene', 'several', 'Congolese', 'soldiers', 'appeal', 'Lumumba', 'prior', 'elections', 'improve', 'lot', 'Later', 'soldiers', 'break', 'cabinet', 'meeting', 'AFTER', 'independence', 'demand', 'removal', 'Belgian', 'officers', 'promotions', 'etc', 'fact', 'was', 'Force', 'Publique', 'had', 'been', 'undermined', 'promises', 'politicians', 'Lumumba', 'collapse', 'had', 'ripple', 'effects', 'would', 'be', 'felt', 'long', 'Lumumba', 'was', 'gone', 'was', 'coincidence', 'strongman', 'who', 'emerged', 'was', 'Mobutu', 'who', 'was', 'able', 'rebuild', 'Force', 'Publique', 'national', 'army', 'ANC', 'When', 'impasse', 'developed', 'Lumumba', 'President', 'Kasa-Vubu', 'Mobutu', 'was', 'only', 'agent', 'order', 'Congo', 'became', 'dictator', 'Congo', '1997.The', 'director', 'clearly', 'believe', 'Lumumba', 'was', 'better', 'did', 'not', 'become', 'dictator', 'happened', 'virtually', 'newly-independent', 'African', 'states', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'bucking', 'trend', 'elected', 'president', 'period', 'ever', 'stepped', 'down', 'voluntarily', 'stood', 'reelection', 'was', 'also', 'leftist', 'undeniable', 'was', 'certainly', 'leaning', 'towards', 'having', 'Soviet', 'presence', 'country', 'when', 'was', 'removed', 'office', 'Still', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'head', 'good', 'movie']",Lumumba

Ebouaney is electric as the fiery, defiant Lumumba, a man whose worst sin was not sensing and neutralizing the treacherous forces surrounding him.

This film is basically untruth from beginning to end. Its wishful thinking and self-deception as history.Patrice Lumumba became a mythological figure in death that the real man doesn't live up to. Lumumba was a congolese politician who was handed power by the departing belgians and within days had destroyed the country. In succession, he triggered an army mutiny which he then tried to suppress by an open appeal to racial violence and when that didn't work, he called in a multinational force whose members then set about buying groups of politicians. Lumumba was removed from office while planning his next step of taking the country into civil war.Contrary to the view in the film, it was not the colonialist conspiracy that wanted Lumumba dead, it was almost every player in the politics of Congo that wanted him dead. Raoul Peck ends up reinforcing the old ideas of Africans as naive child-like victims of the evil international conspiracy. Therefore the reasons for Lumumba's death cannot be found inside among the people of congo. It has to be a conspiracy.It was not any vision of a united Africa that doomed Lumumba. It was that he was a bad leader who managed to lead the country into ruin within days of taking power. The film is an exercise in self-deception among those who see the ""big man"" as the solution to Africa's problems.",1,a tapestery of lies,1203120000,"02 16, 2008",2008,1443,"['Raoul', 'Peck', 'be', 'have', 'been', 'troubled', 'facts', 'subjects', 'life', 'made', 'up', 'own', 'film', 'basically', 'untruth', 'beginning', 'end', 'wishful', 'thinking', 'self-deception', 'history.Patrice', 'Lumumba', 'became', 'mythological', 'figure', 'death', 'real', 'man', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'Lumumba', 'was', 'congolese', 'politician', 'who', 'was', 'handed', 'power', 'departing', 'belgians', 'days', 'had', 'destroyed', 'country', 'succession', 'triggered', 'army', 'mutiny', 'then', 'tried', 'suppress', 'open', 'appeal', 'racial', 'violence', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'called', 'multinational', 'force', 'members', 'then', 'set', 'buying', 'groups', 'politicians', 'Lumumba', 'was', 'removed', 'office', 'planning', 'next', 'step', 'taking', 'country', 'civil', 'war.Contrary', 'view', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'colonialist', 'conspiracy', 'wanted', 'Lumumba', 'dead', 'was', 'almost', 'player', 'politics', 'Congo', 'wanted', 'dead', 'Raoul', 'Peck', 'up', 'reinforcing', 'old', 'ideas', 'Africans', 'naive', 'child-like', 'victims', 'evil', 'international', 'conspiracy', 'reasons', 'Lumumba', 'death', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'found', 'people', 'congo', 'be', 'conspiracy.It', 'was', 'not', 'vision', 'united', 'Africa', 'doomed', 'Lumumba', 'was', 'was', 'bad', 'leader', 'who', 'managed', 'lead', 'country', 'ruin', 'days', 'taking', 'power', 'film', 'exercise', 'self-deception', 'who', 'see', 'big', 'man', 'solution', 'Africa', 'problems']",Lumumba

In fact, at 109 minutes, this version is actually six minutes shorter than the ""Special Edition,"" (also Region 1), that is listed at 115 minutes.  The sleeve for this version also claims to have an English-language soundtrack, but it does not.  It does have English-language subtitles to go with the French soundtrack, however.  The sleeve for this version claims that it its aspect ration is 1:2.35, but that does not appear to be true, either--the aspect ratio appears to be 1:1.85, the same as the Special Edition.  Because the Special Edition contains many extras--including excepts from R. Peck's excellent documentary ""Lumumba: Death of a Prophet,"" it is clearly the better choice for anyone who wants to purchase a DVD of this film right now.  Ideally, however, we should press for a release of the full 3-hour version of this film, preferably packaged together with the FULL documentary ""Lumumba: Death of a Prophet.""
