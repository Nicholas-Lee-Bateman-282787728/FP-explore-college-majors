1546374,AYG1U47VFZ165,B008582FCK,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[5, 6]","Chloe Sevigny first came on my radar as the delightfully self-obsessed middle wife to Bill Paxton's polygamist in the HBO series BIG LOVE.  In it, Sevigny showed rare depth to attempt manipulating every character she came into contact with while trying to preserve the right to privacy of her ever-growing family.  In 2010, she received a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress - a reflection of the kind of performance she delivered on LOVE - so it only stands to reason that she'd continue to find top notch properties to further enhance her craft while displaying an accomplished ability to inhabit any character.Who would ever have imagined that she'd find her next complex work as the pre-operative transgender hitman with a heart of gold?(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come', then read on ...)Let me dispense with some scuttlebutt right off the bat: much of the advertising materials I've been able to review regarding HIT & MISS presently indicate that there was never any plan for the show to continue beyond a single season.  In fact, much of it clearly indicates it was a six-part British drama miniseries.  I've done some digging, and I've been able to find some notations that this isn't necessarily true.  Conflicting reports indicate that the program never continued beyond this single season because it was filmed on location in Manchester (England) and Ms. Sevigny didn't much care for the town's constantly dreary conditions.  Still, I've found other citations which indicate producers never contracted Ms. Sevigny beyond a single season and, thus, that's all they ever intended; however, the lead actress spilled the beans in an interview that the other actors were all contracted for multiple seasons and perhaps they only offered her a single season because they feared they couldn't acquire her for the show if they asked for more.Let me just say that, whatever the issue, it's sad that these six episodes are all audiences will ever get.The cold and calculating assassin, Mia (played by Sevigny), is a transgender woman saving her earnings to pay for an eventual operation to complete the transformation to full womanhood.  However, when she receives a letter from her dying ex-girlfriend Wendy (see infrequently as a ghost in the program), Mia learns she has an 11-year-old son, Ryan (Jorden Bennie).  When Mia arrives to meet him, she finds an entire family of resentful children, all in need of a guardian, a role to which she eventually succumbs.  But will she be able to finish out her career as a hitman before her criminal past destroys her future?HIT & MISS explores a wealth of issues in its six episodes.  Mia is constantly struggling with controlling both the male and female influences heavily at play in her own damaged psyche, and the four children she `inherits' as well run the gamut of emotions in reconciling their own loss with their newfound sense of family.  Thrown into the mix are some additional characters - a male love-interest for Mia, an aging mob chieftain who won't let Mia go quietly into the night, etc. - that bring the drama some further surprising depth.  While loss and grief tend to be the foundation of almost every relationship explored, HIT also rather smartly uses these characters to inject a little sunlight into such a tense but clouded existence.The series is filled with more nice moments than it possibly deserves.  The first five episodes are lean and mean but still manage to introduce so many elements I questioned how it could all possibly come together in a single 45-minute conclusion.  For the most part, the sixth episode is a bit of a creative cop-out - as I suspected, there was no way all of this was going to be wrapped up neatly in a bow in what appears to be the show's finale - but I can't help but wonder if the showrunners didn't deliberately paint themselves into a corner hoping that the program's final scene stand as symbolic for what they were themselves experiencing.  I won't spoil it, but I will say it involves the show's three central characters - one symbolizing the past, one as the present, and one as the future - staring each other down in ways that epitomize perhaps what HIT & MISS was all about all along.HIT & MISS is produced by Abbott Vision and Red Production Company.  DVD distribution (stateside) is being handled through BFS Entertainment & Multimedia Limited.  As for the technical specifications, no expense was spared in giving this program the finest sight and sounds possible; these six episodes are chocked full of some excellent cinematography.  As for the special features, there are two - first is an hour-long session of cast & crew interviews that speak to the entirely of the creative process, and second is a produced Q & A session with Ms. Sevigny and the creative personnel.  (For what it's worth, I learned more from the cast & crew feature than I did the Q & A.)HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION POSSIBLE.  For all intents and purposes, it would appear that HIT & MISS will forever consist of only these six episodes; there has been some talk surrounding the possibility of a second season - I've been able to uncover that the entire cast, with the exception of Sevigny, were contracted for additional work - but it's been a long time since that topic has come up again.  And that's sad: these first five episodes were terrific - relentlessly addictive - and while that finale was exceptional I have to be honest and say it felt more surreal than real, like the creative folk were trying to compress more story into 45-minutes than was humanly possible.  (Did they secretly know it was going to be their last hurrah?)  Still, it's a poignant cliffhanger that may be best left up for resolution in the minds of those who enjoyed the show most: the audience.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at BFS Entertainment & Multimedia Limited provided me with a DVD copy of HIT & MISS by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",5,Relentlessly Addictive Crime Drama

1546375,A2ROF96YGZNRI9,B008582FCK,"Ernst Wiltmann ""store746""","[0, 0]","Not a boring minute in this series. I was thrilled by the characters and specially by Chloe Sevigny, who played her difficult part as a trans sexual hit woman very convincingly. The story centers in political corrupt and criminal circles, where problems are resolved through extrem violence, and rutless betrayal. The character of Chloe is torn between a family of children, where She is/was the ""father"" and the ""job"" She sometimes has to attempt too.It becomes increasingly difficult for our Protagonist not to involve her children in a war of crime, where the sidesare not drawn, and where an ally today, can become your enemy tomorrow. Ultimately, our protagonist seeks a sex change operation to become a woman. So it's save to call our Protagonist a woman, because that's the way She looks and feels. Her lover, does not know about her transsexual state, until She can no longer hide it, this journey without leaving any spoilers is very delicately entertaining. Our Protagonist plays a very attractive person, which leaves her victims (hits), mostly unexpecting. Not being suspicious looking for her hits, is giving her an edge in the trade of carrying out criminal death sentences.

1546376,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B008582FCK,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 2]","When I originally heard the concept of the five part series ""Hit & Miss,"" I knew that I had to see it!  A transsexual (male to female) contract killer discovers a son she never knew and unwittingly becomes the mother figure for her ex-lover's brood of four.  It's such a wacky premise, it seems hard to imagine how realistically the situation has actually been rendered!  But when you consider the show was created by Paul Abbott, it all starts to make sense.  Abbott is the British auteur who created two of my all time favorite TV productions and worked on many other noteworthy successes.  His miniseries ""State of Play"" is one of the finest political thrillers that TV has produced (you may have seen the 2009 Russell Crowe film adaptation, but treat yourself to this six-parter from 2003).  But perhaps his crowning achievement, in my eyes, is the irreverent and indescribable ""Shameless.""  Speaking of the original British presentation (it also has a William H. Macy helmed American version on Showtime), I admire the guts and audacity that was necessary to accomplish an absolute television original.  Not worried about good taste or political correctness, Abbott's ingenious creation in ""Shameless"" is a modern family unlike any other on contemporary TV.In many ways, ""Hit & Miss"" owes a huge debt to ""Shameless.""  The domestic scenes, especially, are eerily reminiscent of the earlier show.  But trust me, ""Hit & Miss"" is an entirely different beast played in all seriousness.  The show starts with a literal bang as we meet Chloe Sevigny out on a murderous assignment.  This woman is all business, and that business is Death!  We soon learn, however, that there is more to Sevigny than meets the eye (if you catch my drift).  If the idea of seeing an undressed Sevigny sporting a prosthetic appendage makes you squeamish, this is NOT the show for you.  After establishing her profession, we quickly get to the principle plot point.  Sevigny finds out she fathered a son while living as a man and that the boy's mother has recently passed.  She sets out to meet him and the other children the woman left behind.  Needless to say, it creates an uncomfortable situation and the heart of ""Hit & Miss"" lies with the question of whether this group has what it takes to become a family.Of course, there are serious complications along the way.  Sevigny's boss (Peter Wight) is initially wary of this new development, then gets a little too close for comfort.  A local bully (Vincent Regan) is carrying on with the eldest daughter AND threatening to expel the clan from their home.  A strange man (Ben Crompton) seems to be lurking around the estate.  And the kids don't know whether to trust that Sevigny is in it for the long haul.  The one bright spot is a new love interest (Jonas Armstrong), but can he handle the truth of Sevigny's anatomy?  There really is a lot going on in ""Hit & Miss,"" maybe a little too much.  The show succeeds best as a domestic drama.  The family unit elicits many painful moments, but many heartfelt and hopeful ones as well.  This is never warm and fuzzy or comfortable, though.  Each advance is hard fought!Although original, I don't think that ""Hit & MIss"" is a perfect show.  We never delve too deeply into the how or why the central character became a killer and all of her assignments occur with little explanation.  I wasn't especially fond of a late development that had Sevigny reuniting with her family.  It came across as heavy handed and rushed, perhaps one element too many for this five part series.  And if you like closure, forget about it!  I don't mind things open-ended, but I know that this drives some people crazy.  ""Hit & Miss"" literally ends in the middle of the final confrontation.  Know going in that there will be no real resolution.  But I still fully recommend the experience.  Sevigny serves an unusual and satisfying performance, all the more powerful due to its unpredictability.  Creator Abbott likes to push boundaries.  Here, his success is presenting a truly original heroine, and I never lost interest in trying to get to know about her.  For more adventurous adult audiences, try it for something off the beaten track.  KGHarris, 6/13.",4,"What's a Hit Man, A Transsexual, And A Single Dad All Have In Common?

For someone who isn't quite female yet (Mia needs to complete the transformation with surgery), Mia radiates female power - we can only think of her as a guy when she's in the shower. I have a vision of Chloe Sevigny playing the lead in a contemporary remake of ""Of Human Bondage."" Chloe could play both the bad girl (like Bette Davis) and the good girl who saves the nice guy's soul at the end.  Sevigny is a fashion designer who could absolutely give herself two different looks and play two different characters in the same movie.",5,"Was ""Hit & Miss"" Inspired by ""Breaking Bad?""",1369526400,"05 26, 2013",2013,998,"['Breaking', 'Bad', 'was', 'based', 'ridiculous', 'premise', 'however', 'great', 'acting', 'script', 'direction', 'photography', 'music', 'somehow', 'fly', 'eagle', 'Hit', 'Miss', 'similar', 'lead', 'character', 'major', 'medical', 'issue', 'trying', 'support', 'family', 'money', 'earned', 'rendering', 'extreme', 'service', 'Hit', 'Miss', 'charismatic', 'Chloe', 'Sevigny', 'Mia', 'field', 'gravity', 'reeled', 'lot', 'unlikely', 'stuff', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'quite', 'female', 'yet', 'Mia', 'complete', 'transformation', 'surgery', 'Mia', 'female', 'power', 'can', 'only', 'think', 'guy', 'when', 'shower', 'have', 'vision', 'Chloe', 'Sevigny', 'playing', 'lead', 'contemporary', 'remake', 'Human', 'Bondage', 'Chloe', 'could', 'play', 'bad', 'girl', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'good', 'girl', 'who', 'nice', 'guy', 'soul', 'end', 'Sevigny', 'fashion', 'designer', 'who', 'could', 'absolutely', 'give', 'two', 'different', 'looks', 'play', 'two', 'different', 'characters', 'same', 'movie']",Hit & Miss

What makes this drama interesting is that Mia is a contract killer and he needs to kill a lot of people to earn enough money to complete the transgender process and become a woman.In Mia's mind, she is already a woman and lives the part. But a complication threatens her plans. When Mia's former wife dies, the male to female contract killer inherits several children.I enjoyed watching this drama with its stark Irish setting, but felt cheated when it ended, because I wanted more of a conclusion. I felt as if the story were left hanging.

1546381,A25OZ0AQNXTNLQ,B008582FCK,"MsFancyPantz ""MsFanctPantz""","[0, 0]","I found this show via Jonas Armstrong.  When I read the synopsis I thought I was going to have to dig the internet for torrents because no way was this a show that would air on US TV, let alone be readily available on Netflix or Amazon.  I was overjoyed that it's on Netflix streaming (in case anyone wants to check it out there).  I had no idea what to expect from this.The plot is a little convoluted, but well thought out and incredibly brave subject matter.  I actually could have done without the hit man part - I didn't think it was very well done at all.  Chloe just didn't sell herself as a man or even androgynous in these scenes.  She fought, looked, and shot like a girl - a girl with no experience fighting or shooting a gun.  As the main hook of the show I wish they would have sent her to better fighting camp prior to filming like the camp they put Hillary Swank thru.  There was several scenes of her hitting stuff (people, bags of meat) where not only would she have broke her own hand/wrist had she hit like that in real life, but would be delivering completely ineffectual flailing girl punches that most certainly would never knock a grown man out or even give a black eye.  I felt completely immersed in Mia's world except in those scenes.  And even the big guns Mia yields - in several scenes it looked like she was struggling to have the strength to cock/assemble/carry them.  I don't know how else they could have fixed those flaws, maybe a body double?  Thankfully these scenes were few and short just to move the other story lines.  Where this show was heartbreaking and fantastic for me was the scenes of Mia dealing with her world as TG, and watching how the writers chose to have the world deal with her.  I don't know if I've ever seen a movie or show unflinchingly let us into the mind of a transgendered person.  Chloe was brilliant in this.  The family was a little over the top, I especially cared less for the older brother, he was annoying.  The sister was fantastic and acted just as I imagine I would myself had I been in her shoes.  Amazingly, I loved what they did with the boyfriend.  Although I really didn't see my idea of ""fun"" play out in the show and what time Ben and Mia spent together that would send him head over heels in love with her so much that he can put aside his own identity as a hetro man (which could and should have been explored MUCH more - I mean, that's a HUGE deal.  HUGE.  Easily enough for a whole episode of just Ben dealing with his feelings, prejudices and sexuality), but I can suspend my disbelief based on the chemistry Jonas and Chloe had on camera and just imagine they had oodles of cuddle/talking/fun together that we just don't see due to time constraints.  The ending was a great cliffhanger, and I am sad to hear they won't be continuing this series.  Given a chance, I think it really could have broken down doors in the entertainment world.",5,I don't know what I just watched but I want more,1373760000,"07 14, 2013",2013,2923,"['found', 'show', 'Jonas', 'Armstrong', 'When', 'read', 'synopsis', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'have', 'dig', 'internet', 'torrents', 'way', 'was', 'show', 'would', 'air', 'US', 'TV', 'let', 'alone', 'be', 'readily', 'available', 'Netflix', 'Amazon', 'was', 'overjoyed', 'Netflix', 'streaming', 'case', 'anyone', 'check', 'there', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'expect', 'this.The', 'plot', 'little', 'convoluted', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'incredibly', 'brave', 'subject', 'matter', 'actually', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'hit', 'man', 'part', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Chloe', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'sell', 'man', 'even', 'androgynous', 'scenes', 'fought', 'looked', 'shot', 'girl', 'girl', 'experience', 'fighting', 'shooting', 'gun', 'main', 'hook', 'show', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'sent', 'better', 'fighting', 'camp', 'prior', 'filming', 'camp', 'put', 'Hillary', 'Swank', 'thru', 'was', 'several', 'scenes', 'hitting', 'stuff', 'people', 'bags', 'meat', 'where', 'not', 'only', 'would', 'have', 'broke', 'own', 'hand/wrist', 'had', 'hit', 'real', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'delivering', 'completely', 'ineffectual', 'flailing', 'girl', 'punches', 'most', 'certainly', 'would', 'never', 'knock', 'grown', 'man', 'even', 'give', 'black', 'eye', 'felt', 'completely', 'immersed', 'Mia', 'world', 'scenes', 'even', 'big', 'guns', 'Mia', 'yields', 'several', 'scenes', 'looked', 'was', 'struggling', 'have', 'strength', 'cock/assemble/carry', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'else', 'could', 'have', 'fixed', 'flaws', 'maybe', 'body', 'double', 'Thankfully', 'scenes', 'were', 'few', 'short', 'just', 'move', 'other', 'story', 'lines', 'Where', 'show', 'was', 'heartbreaking', 'fantastic', 'was', 'scenes', 'Mia', 'dealing', 'world', 'TG', 'watching', 'how', 'writers', 'chose', 'have', 'world', 'deal', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'show', 'unflinchingly', 'let', 'mind', 'transgendered', 'person', 'Chloe', 'was', 'brilliant', 'family', 'was', 'little', 'top', 'especially', 'cared', 'less', 'older', 'brother', 'was', 'annoying', 'sister', 'was', 'fantastic', 'acted', 'just', 'imagine', 'would', 'myself', 'had', 'been', 'shoes', 'Amazingly', 'loved', 'what', 'did', 'boyfriend', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'idea', 'fun', 'play', 'out', 'show', 'what', 'time', 'Ben', 'Mia', 'spent', 'together', 'would', 'send', 'head', 'heels', 'love', 'so', 'much', 'can', 'put', 'aside', 'own', 'identity', 'hetro', 'man', 'could', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'explored', 'MUCH', 'more', 'mean', 'HUGE', 'deal', 'HUGE', 'Easily', 'enough', 'whole', 'episode', 'just', 'Ben', 'dealing', 'feelings', 'prejudices', 'sexuality', 'can', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'based', 'chemistry', 'Jonas', 'Chloe', 'had', 'camera', 'just', 'imagine', 'had', 'oodles', 'cuddle/talking/fun', 'together', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'due', 'time', 'constraints', 'ending', 'was', 'great', 'cliffhanger', 'am', 'sad', 'hear', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'continuing', 'series', 'Given', 'chance', 'think', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'broken', 'down', 'doors', 'entertainment', 'world']",Hit & Miss
