1129577,A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6,B00113VKA4,Bradley F. Smith,"[3, 3]","A love story of two Dutch Holocaust survivors who courted in a concentration camp and somehow made it out alive. Great interweaving of documentary footage of the Nazi era, with contemporary interviews. Though he's 93 in the film, the man, Jack, is incredibly alive, as is his wife. Both are very articulate. You wonder what's made them stay so young this long. I wished there was more about their lives in the 60 years since the war ended. You see their kids, but that's it. Well worth watching as a tale human endurance.",4,Incredible tale,1222128000,"09 23, 2008",2008,521,"['love', 'story', 'two', 'Dutch', 'Holocaust', 'survivors', 'who', 'courted', 'concentration', 'camp', 'somehow', 'made', 'out', 'alive', 'Great', 'interweaving', 'documentary', 'footage', 'Nazi', 'era', 'contemporary', 'interviews', '93', 'film', 'man', 'Jack', 'incredibly', 'alive', 'wife', 'are', 'very', 'articulate', 'wonder', 'what', 'made', 'stay', 'so', 'young', 'long', 'wished', 'was', 'more', 'lives', '60', 'years', 'war', 'ended', 'see', 'kids', 'Well', 'worth', 'watching', 'tale', 'human', 'endurance']",N/A

Not everyone might agree with the background of the love story, but it is love none the less and shows basic human nature continued even through the dramatic and painful period of the Holocaust. Jaap and Ina's story is a great testament to the human spirit. The best part of the documentary was when he spoke to the school children as he and Ina walked the path in Westerbrook so many years later. So much can be learned and appreciated from his words. There are adult themes in this so I don't think it would be appropriate for younger audiences.",3,great testament of the human spirit...,1209340800,"04 28, 2008",2008,659,"['was', 'real', 'interesting', 'take', 'Holocaust', 'really', 'realness', 'lives', 'touched', 'Not', 'everyone', 'might', 'agree', 'background', 'love', 'story', 'love', 'none', 'less', 'basic', 'human', 'nature', 'continued', 'even', 'dramatic', 'painful', 'period', 'Holocaust', 'Jaap', 'Ina', 'story', 'great', 'testament', 'human', 'spirit', 'best', 'part', 'documentary', 'was', 'when', 'spoke', 'school', 'children', 'Ina', 'walked', 'path', 'Westerbrook', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'So', 'much', 'can', 'be', 'learned', 'appreciated', 'words', 'are', 'adult', 'themes', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'be', 'appropriate', 'younger', 'audiences']",N/A
1129580,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00113VKA4,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 1]","Michele Ohayon's ""Steal a Pencil for Me"" is a moving documentary about two Dutch Holocaust survivors who carried on a love affair - largely through a surreptitious exchange of letters - while imprisoned in a Nazi concentration camp. Though Jack was with his wife at the time, he nevertheless fell in love with Ina, a 20-year-old woman, who immediately became the love of his life.As seen in present-day interviews (circa 2006), Jack and Ina make a delightful Old World couple, he in his 90s and she ten years younger. Ina, in particular, exudes a beauty and grace that, even in her 80s, reveal the fetching and bewitching girl who caught Jack's eye and captured his heart all those years ago. They also possess a charming sense of humor and a positive view of life and humanity that are only occasionally dimmed by the tears brought on by the memories of horrors past.Yet, while there is plenty of footage chronicling those horrors, the focus of the film is on showing how beauty and love were able to flourish even in mankind's darkest hour. It's well worth seeing.",4,Love flourishes even in mankind's darkest hour,1352851200,"11 14, 2012",2012,1066,"['Michele', 'Ohayon', 'Steal', 'Pencil', 'Me', 'moving', 'documentary', 'two', 'Dutch', 'Holocaust', 'survivors', 'who', 'carried', 'love', 'affair', 'largely', 'surreptitious', 'exchange', 'letters', 'while', 'imprisoned', 'Nazi', 'concentration', 'camp', 'Jack', 'was', 'wife', 'time', 'nevertheless', 'fell', 'love', 'Ina', '20-year-old', 'woman', 'who', 'immediately', 'became', 'love', 'life.As', 'seen', 'present-day', 'interviews', 'circa', '2006', 'Jack', 'Ina', 'make', 'delightful', 'Old', 'World', 'couple', '90s', 'ten', 'years', 'younger', 'Ina', 'particular', 'beauty', 'grace', 'even', '80s', 'reveal', 'fetching', 'bewitching', 'girl', 'who', 'caught', 'Jack', 'eye', 'captured', 'heart', 'years', 'ago', 'also', 'possess', 'charming', 'sense', 'humor', 'positive', 'view', 'life', 'humanity', 'are', 'only', 'occasionally', 'dimmed', 'tears', 'brought', 'memories', 'horrors', 'past.Yet', 'plenty', 'footage', 'chronicling', 'horrors', 'focus', 'film', 'showing', 'how', 'beauty', 'love', 'were', 'able', 'flourish', 'even', 'mankind', 'darkest', 'hour', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing']",N/A
1129581,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B00113VKA4,Z Hayes,"[5, 6]","""Steal A Pencil for Me"" is not a conventional Holocaust story though the people featured in it were Holocaust victims. I say this because the story is mainly an exploration of the relationship between two individuals who fell in love despite the odds being against them. Israeli director Michele Ohayon uses a documentary style to tell the story of Jack (Jaap) Polak, and his wife of 60 years Ina Soep Polak, who met in Amsterdam before the war, when Jack was married to another woman. The pair are instantly attracted to each other despite their very different backgrounds - Jack comes from an average financial background, whereas Ina comes from a wealthy family (her father was in the diamond polishing industry). When WW II breaks out, the pair (together with Jack's wife) end up in the Westerbork transit camp and later get moved to Bergen-Belsen. Throughout their internment, Jack and Ina maintain contact, exchanging letters in secret at a time when paper and pencil were prized commodities (hence the title of the feature which was also a phrase written by Jack in one of his letters to Ina).I viewed their story with sympathy mainly because Jack's marriage to his wife was already in trouble before he met Ina - his wife was a jealous woman yet treated him almost with indifference, and the contrast between Ina and Jack's first wife was rather startling. The story moves back and forth between the past and the present - the past is often portrayed through the use of old photographs and archival film footage, and in the present we see Jack (at 93, still quite alert with a knowing gleam in his eyes) and Ina still as in love as when they were younger. It was heartening to see Jack still active in Holocaust education, and to know that this couple weathered the most unimaginable horrors and yet were strengthened by their love for each other, makes this a truly moving account.",4,A love story amidst the horrors of the Holocaust,1264032000,"01 21, 2010",2010,1890,"['Steal', 'Pencil', 'Me', 'not', 'conventional', 'Holocaust', 'story', 'people', 'featured', 'were', 'Holocaust', 'victims', 'say', 'story', 'mainly', 'exploration', 'relationship', 'two', 'individuals', 'who', 'fell', 'love', 'odds', 'being', 'Israeli', 'director', 'Michele', 'Ohayon', 'documentary', 'style', 'tell', 'story', 'Jack', 'Jaap', 'Polak', 'wife', '60', 'years', 'Ina', 'Soep', 'Polak', 'who', 'met', 'Amsterdam', 'war', 'when', 'Jack', 'was', 'married', 'woman', 'pair', 'are', 'instantly', 'attracted', 'other', 'very', 'different', 'backgrounds', 'Jack', 'average', 'financial', 'background', 'Ina', 'wealthy', 'family', 'father', 'was', 'diamond', 'polishing', 'industry', 'When', 'WW', 'II', 'out', 'pair', 'together', 'Jack', 'wife', 'end', 'up', 'Westerbork', 'transit', 'camp', 'later', 'get', 'moved', 'Bergen-Belsen', 'internment', 'Jack', 'Ina', 'maintain', 'contact', 'exchanging', 'letters', 'secret', 'time', 'when', 'paper', 'pencil', 'were', 'prized', 'commodities', 'hence', 'title', 'feature', 'was', 'also', 'phrase', 'written', 'Jack', 'one', 'letters', 'Ina', '.I', 'viewed', 'story', 'sympathy', 'mainly', 'Jack', 'marriage', 'wife', 'was', 'already', 'trouble', 'met', 'Ina', 'wife', 'was', 'jealous', 'woman', 'yet', 'treated', 'almost', 'indifference', 'contrast', 'Ina', 'Jack', 'first', 'wife', 'was', 'rather', 'startling', 'story', 'back', 'forth', 'past', 'present', 'past', 'often', 'portrayed', 'use', 'old', 'photographs', 'archival', 'film', 'footage', 'present', 'see', 'Jack', '93', 'still', 'quite', 'alert', 'knowing', 'gleam', 'eyes', 'Ina', 'still', 'love', 'when', 'were', 'younger', 'was', 'heartening', 'see', 'Jack', 'still', 'active', 'Holocaust', 'education', 'know', 'couple', 'weathered', 'most', 'unimaginable', 'horrors', 'yet', 'were', 'strengthened', 'love', 'other', 'truly', 'moving', 'account']",N/A
