Gere's character Erroll Babbage takes his job very seriously2. A little TOO seriously if you ask anybody, including his superiors3. Before they show him the door, they show him Allison Lowry (Danes) and give him a couple of weeks to train her in the job.4. Her instructions are slightly different5. A girl goes missing6. Babbage takes it personally7. Disjointed and improbable plot follows, filled with disgusting degeneracy, the glaringly obvious and the highly unlikely.Even winning performances by Gere and Danes can't save this unworkable storyline, which takes them into the depths of depravity in the search for a missing girl.

1141071,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B0013D8LCC,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[4, 6]","Although THE FLOCK has some pretty good acting by veteran Richard Gere, and some okay shots that might harken some back to THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS days, the movie stretches credibility to the breaking point and destroys itself against a plot that really leads nowhere.The film is about Erroll Babbage (Gere) who works for the department of safety and is preparing to retire. His office thrusts upon him his replacement, Allison Lowry (Claire Danes,Stardust), who quickly discovers that Babbage is obsessed with his job. And that job ain't very fun. He monitors hundreds of sexual offenders who are on parole in his jurisdiction. Allison goes with Erroll on many calls to check up on his ""flock"" of offenders and learns that he is in desperate need of retirement. But Erroll is good at his job even if his methods aren't. He taunts sexual predators and even has physical conflicts with them. Erroll justifies his actions by bringing up these deviants' pasts. It is this ""good justification"" that challenges the audience on some level, letting us see how brutal Erroll is and yet how out-of-touch he's become (by being too close to his job).When a teenage girl goes missing in Erroll's ""area"", he immediate leaps to the conclusion that she was abducted by one of his flock. But how could he know? Is Erroll that good at his job? Allison challenges him and Erroll pushes back. Their battles become as fierce as Erroll's need to find this missing girl.Although the set-up for the story was okay, it didn't have any umpf! I will give credit to Richard Gere, however, who plays the Erroll character very well. Battling retirement. Worried about everyone who's near his flock. Disgusted with those he's responsible for overseeing. Disgusted with himself for having to do some of things he does. Quite a change in character portrayal for Gere. But beyond him there's not much else. Some of the sets are okay (dark and dangerous) but there are so many other problems as to be laughable.I'll be the first to admit that suspending disbelief is a requirement whenever watching films. But that suspension has limits. The biggest push against those limits is the destruction of EXTREMELY vital crime scenes. Someone as meticulous as Erroll would KNOW that moving a body would be a huge no-no. Or trampling through a crime scene. Or moving evidence. It went beyond and hurt the film to no end.The other damaging part of this film is that we never get into Clair Danes' character, Allison. She's almost dropped by the wayside at the end of the film and we're never privy to what her intension might be: Will she stay or leave? Will she end up like Erroll if she does stay?This isn't a horrible film as it does touch on some uncomfortable moral ground, but the story as a whole needed to be tightened up.P.S. The fact that this movie went straight to DVD and didn't get air time at cinemas in the U.S. is pretty telling. As is the fact that only three other reviews are up here at Amazon.com at the time of my posting.",2,What the Flock?,1213660800,"06 17, 2008",2008,3002,"['THE', 'FLOCK', 'pretty', 'good', 'acting', 'veteran', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'okay', 'shots', 'might', 'harken', 'back', 'THE', 'SILENCE', 'THE', 'LAMBS', 'days', 'movie', 'credibility', 'breaking', 'point', 'plot', 'really', 'nowhere.The', 'film', 'Erroll', 'Babbage', 'Gere', 'who', 'department', 'safety', 'preparing', 'retire', 'office', 'thrusts', 'replacement', 'Allison', 'Lowry', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'Stardust', 'who', 'quickly', 'Babbage', 'obsessed', 'job', 'job', 'ai', ""n't"", 'very', 'fun', 'hundreds', 'sexual', 'offenders', 'who', 'are', 'parole', 'jurisdiction', 'Allison', 'Erroll', 'many', 'calls', 'check', 'up', 'flock', 'offenders', 'desperate', 'need', 'retirement', 'Erroll', 'good', 'job', 'even', 'methods', 'are', ""n't"", 'sexual', 'predators', 'even', 'physical', 'conflicts', 'Erroll', 'actions', 'bringing', 'up', 'deviants', 'pasts', 'good', 'justification', 'audience', 'level', 'letting', 'see', 'how', 'brutal', 'Erroll', 'yet', 'how', 'out-of-touch', 'become', 'being', 'too', 'close', 'job', 'teenage', 'girl', 'missing', 'Erroll', 'area', 'immediate', 'leaps', 'conclusion', 'was', 'abducted', 'one', 'flock', 'how', 'could', 'know', 'Erroll', 'that', 'good', 'job', 'Allison', 'Erroll', 'back', 'battles', 'become', 'as', 'fierce', 'Erroll', 'need', 'find', 'missing', 'set-up', 'story', 'was', 'okay', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'umpf', 'will', 'give', 'credit', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'however', 'who', 'Erroll', 'character', 'very', 'well', 'Battling', 'retirement', 'Worried', 'everyone', 'who', 'flock', 'Disgusted', 'responsible', 'overseeing', 'Disgusted', 'having', 'do', 'things', 'Quite', 'change', 'character', 'portrayal', 'Gere', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'sets', 'are', 'okay', 'dark', 'dangerous', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'problems', 'be', 'laughable.I', ""'ll"", 'be', 'first', 'admit', 'suspending', 'disbelief', 'requirement', 'whenever', 'watching', 'films', 'suspension', 'limits', 'biggest', 'push', 'limits', 'destruction', 'EXTREMELY', 'vital', 'crime', 'scenes', 'Someone', 'as', 'meticulous', 'Erroll', 'would', 'KNOW', 'moving', 'body', 'would', 'be', 'huge', 'no-no', 'trampling', 'crime', 'scene', 'moving', 'evidence', 'went', 'hurt', 'film', 'end.The', 'other', 'damaging', 'part', 'film', 'never', 'get', 'Clair', 'Danes', 'character', 'Allison', 'almost', 'dropped', 'wayside', 'end', 'film', ""'re"", 'never', 'privy', 'what', 'intension', 'might', 'be', 'Will', 'stay', 'leave', 'Will', 'end', 'up', 'Erroll', 'stay', ""n't"", 'horrible', 'film', 'touch', 'uncomfortable', 'moral', 'ground', 'story', 'whole', 'needed', 'be', 'tightened', 'up.P.S', 'fact', 'movie', 'went', 'straight', 'DVD', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'air', 'time', 'cinemas', 'U.S.', 'pretty', 'telling', 'fact', 'only', 'three', 'other', 'reviews', 'are', 'up', 'here', 'Amazon.com', 'time', 'posting']",N/A

Claire Danes is very low-key, which perhaps what the director meant for her to be, but the result is she projects no personality to speak of and thus forgetable.I just had to write this review, for the sake of stating that I could not DISAGREE more with amazon editorial review.  That review claims there's sexual tension between Gere and Danes.  If there's, I completely missed it.  I was actually expecting for something sexual to develop between the two, but nope - the bond could not come off more asexual.  Another mindboggling editorial statement is that the movie ""condemns sexual deviance while depicting it in absurdly lurid and titillating ways (the scenes in a porn studio/fetish market are slathered with moral indignation but ooze with repressed lust)"".  What???  If I were that editor I would keep these revelations to myself.  Certainly did not find anything in the movie titillating - just utterly disturbing and nauseating.In general, I found this movie great in a documentary/education sense.

With such a treat, logically one should be the next Iron Chef of Hollywood, no?Well, NO! Because somewhere, quite early in the film, Andrew Lau forgot what exactly he was trying to do - and clearly he couldn't remember it until the end...As the result we have a boring film, wasting the talents of both stars. Richard Gere's character,a civil servant making control visits of registered sexual offenders, is unpleasant,stressed, self-destructive and anti-pathic, but definitely not fascinating - in fact he is an annoying guy and watching him is frequently embarassing... His assistant and future replacement, played by Claire Danes, is a rather pale and pathetic person, hardly having anything interesting to say. The handful of sex offenders shown in the film are pretty pathetic people, which is probably how it is in the real world, but as the result they are simply boring!The dialogs are weak, there is not even one moment of humour (even dark one) and the ""investigation"" of the main ""mystery"" is so annoyingly boring, that I had to fast-forward some parts of it. And Avril Lavigne makes just one extremely short cameo - and sorry for disappointing all the hopefuls, but she is very strictly and fully clothed in it... And, let's stress it again, Claire Danes is playing a pale side-kick, saying weak lines and just following the annoying and embarassing Gere's character. Frankly, wasting the potential of not one but two such good actors should earn Andrew Lau a place amongst the registered ""film offenders"" of Hollywood!The only reason I give this film two stars is the character of Viola (played by KaDee Strickland), a female sex offender who seems to be a kind of Babbage's ""pet project"". Her appearances are the only moments when something interesting happens on the screen.Some people compared this movie to the most excellent ""8mm"" but please believe me, those films have NOTHING in common!

Errol's methods are  too harsh for his superiors so they give him one  month before they let him go. Babbage is a loner obsessed with his work, so when one of his sickos doesn't provide the right answers he thinks nothing of slapping him around or beating another with a baseball bat. When a young girl gets kidnapped and held hostage Errol loses it and  makes it his mission to bring her back before he shuffles off. Hoping to keep him in check his boss, (the great Ray Wise) assigns Errol a partner named Alison Lowry (Claire Danes). Babbage doesn't appreciate this so he breaks in his new partner by taking her to a sex dungeon where he rubs her face in how dirty and dangerous their job is. As more clues fall in to place Errol believes that one of his Flock whom he has tangled with before is behind this latest kidnapping. It's a genuine shame that more people aren't going to see this film since it was released Direct to Video. The directing by 'Infernal Affairs' Andrew Lau is solid and the performances he gets out of his cast are excellent. This is one of Gere's riskiest and best performances ever. Danes isn't bad it's just that her own work is overshadowed by Gere's powerhouse performance. The subject matter is  disturbing and graphic which can make this a tough film to watch at times. Hopefully this little seen masterpiece will find an audience on DVD or cable.",3,'Taxi Driver' meets 'Silence of the Lambs',1245196800,"06 17, 2009",2009,1519,"['Sporting', 'cool', 'name', 'hot', 'temper', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'Det', 'Errol', 'Babbage', 'man', 'watching', 'Flock', 'registered', 'sex', 'offenders', 'Errol', 'methods', 'are', 'too', 'harsh', 'superiors', 'give', 'one', 'month', 'let', 'go', 'Babbage', 'loner', 'obsessed', 'work', 'so', 'when', 'one', 'sickos', ""n't"", 'provide', 'right', 'answers', 'nothing', 'slapping', 'around', 'beating', 'baseball', 'bat', 'When', 'young', 'girl', 'kidnapped', 'held', 'hostage', 'Errol', 'mission', 'bring', 'back', 'off', 'Hoping', 'keep', 'check', 'boss', 'great', 'Ray', 'Wise', 'Errol', 'partner', 'named', 'Alison', 'Lowry', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'Babbage', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'so', 'new', 'partner', 'taking', 'sex', 'dungeon', 'where', 'face', 'how', 'dirty', 'dangerous', 'job', 'more', 'clues', 'fall', 'place', 'Errol', 'one', 'Flock', 'whom', 'tangled', 'before', 'latest', 'kidnapping', 'genuine', 'shame', 'more', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'see', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'Direct', 'Video', 'directing', ""'Infernal"", 'Affairs', 'Andrew', 'Lau', 'solid', 'performances', 'cast', 'are', 'excellent', 'one', 'Gere', 'riskiest', 'best', 'performances', 'ever', 'Danes', ""n't"", 'bad', 'just', 'own', 'work', 'overshadowed', 'Gere', 'powerhouse', 'performance', 'subject', 'matter', 'disturbing', 'graphic', 'can', 'make', 'tough', 'film', 'watch', 'times', 'Hopefully', 'little', 'seen', 'masterpiece', 'will', 'find', 'audience', 'DVD', 'cable']",N/A

I don't need to tell you whats in the movie, everyone else has already done that. I was amazed by the movie. Richard Gere, can play ANYTHING and make it come out good. I believe he did better in this, than he did in ""Internal Affairs"" and I believe that's saying a lot. While the movie is some what slow at first, it has to be. It has to get the people watching it, into what's going on. I feel that's hard to do, with the subject at hand.  Sexual predators is a very hard subject to do in a movie. It's a touchy subject. Anyone in ""real life"", who works with these people gets a feeling about them. I doubt that many of them act on it. That's what I love about this movie. I felt myself WANTING to do just what Gere's character did. I can't wait to get the movie for myself. I own ALL of Richard Gere's movies and I haven't be disappointed in any of them. I feel Gere should get an award for this movie, as it IS an out-of-cast character for him, and he plays it so well. I really don't understand the bad reviews that this movie got. I guess that some people expect too much. I just love to watch a movie just for what it is. Now I'm not saying, I haven't seen what I thought was a crappy movie. What ""I"" think is a bad movie. verses other people would probably start an argument.  I guess one persons bad movie is another persons good movie.

1141081,A5TZXWU8AALIC,B0013D8LCC,The JuRK,"[1, 2]","There are almost as many things to really like in this movie as much as there are things to be repulsed by and to dislike.The best thing it has going for it is a terrific performance from Richard Gere.  One of my guilty pleasures is THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES, not because it's a great movie but I'm from that area and knew about the Mothman--and a really good performance from Richard Gere (for an off-the-wall supernatural movie that never quite gels, he gives a sincere depiction of grief and obsession that transcends the material).In THE FLOCK, he's the burned-out monitor to his ""flock,"" his workload of sex offenders he has to keep tabs on.  He's done it for so long that he feels he can even sense when they're going to go ""off the reservation"" and commit more sex crimes.  And if he thinks that, he doesn't mind stomping them into the dirt.  Obviously, a very tightly-wound character who may or may not be someone to admire.But that's the thing about this movie: I think a lot of people will be conflicted at one point or another.Would anyone have a problem with Gere's character physically assaulting sex offenders for the entire movie?  Is he a monster for abusing his power for keeping them ""in line""?  Are any of them truly rehabilitated?  One genuinely evil character will leave wondering after the climax.  This is a movie that gives you a glimpse into deviant sex...and leaves you to wonder if it turns you on.I like all of these elements to a good sexual thriller.But there were things that I wasn't so crazy about.  I had a hard time believing that Claire Danes could take over his job.  There were too many times that she appeared as a damsel in distress, especially in this line of work!  The thriller structure was a little obvious toward the end but I'm not sure what else they could do with it.All in all, THE FLOCK is worth seeing if you like movies like THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and SEVEN (successful) or 8MM (not-so-successful).  Dark, thoughtful, interesting.  Something that makes you look inside your own little tastes and kinks, if you have any.Do you?",3,The Wolf in the Fold,1245801600,"06 24, 2009",2009,2078,"['are', 'almost', 'many', 'things', 'really', 'like', 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'are', 'things', 'be', 'repulsed', 'dislike.The', 'best', 'thing', 'going', 'terrific', 'performance', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'One', 'guilty', 'pleasures', 'THE', 'MOTHMAN', 'PROPHECIES', 'not', 'great', 'movie', ""'m"", 'area', 'knew', 'Mothman', 'really', 'good', 'performance', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'off-the-wall', 'supernatural', 'movie', 'never', 'quite', 'gels', 'sincere', 'depiction', 'grief', 'obsession', 'material', 'THE', 'FLOCK', 'burned-out', 'monitor', 'flock', 'workload', 'sex', 'offenders', 'keep', 'tabs', 'done', 'so', 'long', 'can', 'even', 'sense', 'when', ""'re"", 'going', 'go', 'reservation', 'commit', 'more', 'sex', 'crimes', ""n't"", 'mind', 'stomping', 'dirt', 'Obviously', 'very', 'tightly-wound', 'character', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'someone', 'admire.But', 'thing', 'movie', 'think', 'lot', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'conflicted', 'one', 'point', 'another.Would', 'anyone', 'have', 'problem', 'Gere', 'character', 'physically', 'assaulting', 'sex', 'offenders', 'entire', 'movie', 'monster', 'abusing', 'power', 'keeping', 'line', 'Are', 'truly', 'rehabilitated', 'One', 'genuinely', 'evil', 'character', 'will', 'leave', 'wondering', 'climax', 'movie', 'glimpse', 'deviant', 'sex', 'wonder', 'on.I', 'elements', 'good', 'sexual', 'thriller.But', 'were', 'things', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'crazy', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'believing', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'could', 'take', 'over', 'job', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'appeared', 'damsel', 'distress', 'especially', 'line', 'work', 'thriller', 'structure', 'was', 'little', 'obvious', 'end', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'could', 'do', 'it.All', 'THE', 'FLOCK', 'worth', 'seeing', 'like', 'movies', 'SILENCE', 'THE', 'LAMBS', 'SEVEN', 'successful', '8MM', 'not-so-successful', 'Dark', 'thoughtful', 'interesting', 'Something', 'look', 'own', 'little', 'tastes', 'kinks', 'have', 'any.Do']",N/A
