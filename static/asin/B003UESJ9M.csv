The story could have been much better. I don't think this was based on any single true life story, but easily could have been (Cobain, Presley etc). Even though Beau was 'helping', he had his own reason for making sure the marriage didn't work. It made him look like the hero, but really he was just as much the problem dividing the marriage. To me the movie wasn't predictable. I thought 'alright, she's finally coming to her senses' nope! Perhaps it was her only way out.Depressing! I like to see people brought out of their messes, lives changed. You'll have to look elsewhere for that. In the end what took place (after the death) was going to happen even before she took her life, except her husband was no longer her manager. So, what was the point, considering it's fiction?

The story is a bit disjointed, and the complexity of the relationship between Paltrow's and McGraw's characters isn't clear.  There could have been more dialogue to help us understand what brought this country star to alcohol and drug abuse, which obviously predated the major emotional block in their marriage.  I also wasn't sure about the significance of the bird, but perhaps a second viewing would clear that up.  I was blown away by Paltrow's performance, which had raw emotion, nuance, and multiple emotional layers.  I thought she did a great job of playing a person successful in her career, but not living up to whom she wanted to be personally.  In the end, her career mattered more to her husband than to her, and that's what he failed to understand.I also enjoyed the equally strong acting and singing performances of Meester and Hedlund.

Kelly is not eager because she is still recovering not just from alcohol addiction but also from a devastating tragedy. She does, however reluctantly agree only if she has Beau Hutton, a man with whom she is having a affair ( Garett Hedlund) as a supporting act on the tour. As her husband tries to put together the tour, we get a glimpse at the sad and lonely lives of these superstars and generally life of a band on the road.There are a couple of scenes which are amazing, 1.The singing in classroom at the Make- a -Wish Foundation event.2. Gywneth Paltrow, giving advice in the dressing room to Meester (Chiles Stanton) towards the end of the film.3. The look on the face of Garett Hedlund as he reacts to the crowd cheering the rising star Chiles.I heard a lot of criticisms of this movie; however I found the movie interesting and well acted. Each of the main characters gives some fine performances, Tim Mcgraw is excellent,trying to fulfill his dual roles as manager and husband, Garett Hedlund and Leighton Meeser  are good.  Gwyneth Paltrow still looks amazing and acts well. The songs were great for me because I love country music.

1364159,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B003UESJ9M,Andrew Ellington,"[6, 7]","I'm all for this revitalization of Gwyneth Paltrow's career.  I adore her 90's work and find her recent stint on `Glee' as well as her comeback to film (and departure into music) to be wholly welcome and something I can't get enough of.  Paltrow is a true talent; a shining star and I'm so happy that she's made her way back to us.  While `Country Strong' as a film is very flawed, her performance within is noteworthy for its honesty and earnest quality.I just wish she had been handed a better script.`Country Strong' tells the story of wayward Kelly Canter; Grammy winning country star and public drunk.  The film opens with Kelly in rehab sparking fires with Beau, an orderly who loves to sing and play his guitar.  Kelly is ripped from rehab by her manager/husband who insists that she go back out on the road to rebuild her public figure after an `incident' in Dallas left her name tattered.  At his wife's request, her husband James allows Beau to join her tour (not after some begrudging) as well as a former beauty queen named Chiles.  On the road, relationships form and crumble under the pressure of fame and fortune and the true colors of those involved begin to come through.  It is Kelly, though, who suffers the brunt as her troubles with drinking, not fully under control, begin to interfere with her comeback tour.While the first half makes a tad more sense than the second, the second half isn't bogged down by the ridiculous dialog, so I'm kind of torn as to which half works the best.  It's hard because if I were looking at this as a senseless summer blockbuster then I may react differently to the prose, but when you are this dark and manipulative in your themes then you kind of have to have a sliver of realism in order to back up your direction, and that is something that `Country Strong' just doesn't get.  At its heart, it is trying to make a point that is too extreme.Life isn't always this melancholy.As a whole, `Country Strong' survives because of some real talented actors/singers who make the most of their scarcely developed characters in order to bring us something we want to continue watching.  Paltrow is magnificent as Kelly, who is arguably the most fleshed out of the characters.  She understands the shading needed to make Kelly feel alive, although the repetitive dynamics of the script dampen her chances to shine as brightly as she could have had her character been given more to work with.  I've been impressed with Tim McGraw's performances in the past (I still stand behind my belief that he should have be Oscar nominated for `Friday Night Lights') and he does a commendable job here, although I don't think he layers James in a way that makes him come off as anything other than a creep.  Garrett Hedlund is a little clich&eacute;d in his portrayal of Beau, but his vocal talent is undeniable, and he finds chemistry with both Paltrow and Meester that is delightful to watch.  Speaking of Meester, I was really impressed with her spunky yet guarded portrayal of Chiles.  She really made her feel three-dimensional.  She also breathes a life into the film, a sort of jovial atmosphere that counteracts the films more bleak themes.The ending, while on the outset anti-clich&eacute;d, is a tad predictable, but the actors sell it (for the most part).  Still, the main highlight here is the music, all of which is kind of wonderful.  The songs written for this film are beautiful, especially the big `Coming Home' number and the intimate `Timings Everything', which opens the closes the film perfectly.  I think that Shana Feste has talent as a director and writer, but like her previous work (`The Greatest') she hasn't mastered developing her themes in a way that feel truly authentic.  They feel like fabrications, like movies with a slight soap operatic twist that takes them out of the realm of `gritty, raw and real' and makes them feel somewhat fake.  But, a total plus is the way she works with her actors, and with time I have faith that she can produce something truly noteworthy.But if you do anything, buy the soundtrack!",3,The music in my ears trumps the movie in front of my eyes...,1311120000,"07 20, 2011",2011,4081,"[""'m"", 'revitalization', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'career', 'adore', '90', 'work', 'find', 'recent', 'stint', 'Glee', 'as', 'well', 'comeback', 'film', 'departure', 'music', 'be', 'wholly', 'welcome', 'something', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'Paltrow', 'true', 'talent', 'shining', 'star', ""'m"", 'so', 'happy', 'made', 'way', 'back', 'Country', 'Strong', 'film', 'very', 'flawed', 'performance', 'noteworthy', 'honesty', 'earnest', 'quality.I', 'just', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'handed', 'better', 'script.', 'Country', 'Strong', 'tells', 'story', 'wayward', 'Kelly', 'Canter', 'Grammy', 'winning', 'country', 'star', 'public', 'drunk', 'film', 'Kelly', 'rehab', 'sparking', 'fires', 'Beau', 'orderly', 'who', 'sing', 'play', 'guitar', 'Kelly', 'ripped', 'rehab', 'manager/husband', 'who', 'go', 'back', 'out', 'road', 'rebuild', 'public', 'figure', 'incident', 'Dallas', 'left', 'name', 'tattered', 'wife', 'request', 'husband', 'James', 'Beau', 'join', 'tour', 'not', 'begrudging', 'as', 'well', 'former', 'beauty', 'queen', 'named', 'Chiles', 'road', 'relationships', 'form', 'crumble', 'pressure', 'fame', 'fortune', 'true', 'colors', 'involved', 'begin', 'come', 'Kelly', 'though', 'who', 'brunt', 'troubles', 'drinking', 'not', 'fully', 'control', 'begin', 'interfere', 'comeback', 'first', 'half', 'tad', 'more', 'sense', 'second', 'second', 'half', ""n't"", 'bogged', 'down', 'ridiculous', 'dialog', ""'m"", 'kind', 'torn', 'half', 'best', 'hard', 'were', 'looking', 'senseless', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'then', 'may', 'react', 'differently', 'prose', 'when', 'are', 'dark', 'manipulative', 'themes', 'then', 'kind', 'have', 'have', 'sliver', 'realism', 'order', 'back', 'up', 'direction', 'something', 'Country', 'Strong', 'just', ""n't"", 'get', 'heart', 'trying', 'make', 'point', 'too', 'extreme.Life', ""n't"", 'always', 'melancholy.As', 'whole', 'Country', 'Strong', 'survives', 'real', 'talented', 'actors/singers', 'who', 'make', 'most', 'scarcely', 'developed', 'characters', 'order', 'bring', 'something', 'want', 'continue', 'watching', 'Paltrow', 'magnificent', 'Kelly', 'who', 'arguably', 'most', 'fleshed', 'characters', 'shading', 'needed', 'make', 'Kelly', 'feel', 'alive', 'repetitive', 'dynamics', 'script', 'dampen', 'chances', 'shine', 'as', 'brightly', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'character', 'been', 'given', 'more', 'work', ""'ve"", 'been', 'impressed', 'Tim', 'McGraw', 'performances', 'past', 'still', 'stand', 'belief', 'should', 'have', 'be', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'commendable', 'job', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'James', 'way', 'come', 'off', 'anything', 'other', 'creep', 'Garrett', 'Hedlund', 'little', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'portrayal', 'Beau', 'vocal', 'talent', 'undeniable', 'chemistry', 'Paltrow', 'Meester', 'delightful', 'watch', 'Speaking', 'Meester', 'was', 'really', 'impressed', 'spunky', 'yet', 'guarded', 'portrayal', 'Chiles', 'really', 'made', 'feel', 'three-dimensional', 'also', 'life', 'film', 'sort', 'jovial', 'atmosphere', 'films', 'more', 'bleak', 'themes.The', 'ending', 'outset', 'anti-clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'tad', 'predictable', 'actors', 'sell', 'most', 'part', 'Still', 'main', 'highlight', 'here', 'music', 'kind', 'wonderful', 'songs', 'written', 'film', 'are', 'beautiful', 'especially', 'big', 'Coming', 'Home', 'number', 'intimate', 'Timings', 'Everything', 'closes', 'film', 'perfectly', 'think', 'Shana', 'Feste', 'talent', 'director', 'writer', 'previous', 'work', 'Greatest', ""n't"", 'mastered', 'developing', 'themes', 'way', 'feel', 'truly', 'authentic', 'feel', 'fabrications', 'movies', 'slight', 'soap', 'operatic', 'twist', 'realm', 'gritty', 'raw', 'real', 'feel', 'somewhat', 'fake', 'total', 'plus', 'way', 'actors', 'time', 'have', 'faith', 'can', 'produce', 'something', 'truly', 'noteworthy.But', 'do', 'anything', 'buy', 'soundtrack']",N/A

1364162,A3P6718H05PRGI,B003UESJ9M,"Ashley L. Carter ""Avid Romantic""","[3, 5]","I went into this movie, feeling like I'd already seen it from the previews and for the most part that was true. There were missing pieces and one shocking ending, but mostly true.I found it hard to like the characters save one and that was Chiles who was just so innocent. You felt pity for Kelly who I felt like in some way knew she wasn't ready but despite the title, she wasn't strong enough to make anyone listen. Beau is too busy being completely in love with her and James is too focused on trying to save what is left of her career and forget the past. To be completely honest, I think Beau was the character that I disliked the most and I can't exactly pinpoint why. I love Garrett Hedlund and I think he plays the part well, but something about his character rubbed me the wrong way. He's a jerk half the time to Chiles, only really nice to her when he's drunk. Then there is this constant pull you feel between him and Chiles while he's supposed to be having his affair with Kelly. He'll look at Chiles with the same puppy dog look of affection in his eyes that he looks at Kelly with. Now it's possible he can love them both but for different reasons. Perhaps he was initially attracted to Kelly because of who she was and all that she had accomplished and later it grew into a kind of protective, brotherly love. But with Chiles, maybe she just makes him feel alive and he likes how it feels not to have to constantly worry about what she's doing. But that's me just trying to make it sound okay in my head. But from where I'm standing, he's just as lost as everyone else with just as many issues. Hm, maybe that's the point. But there's just something about him that just...I don't know. He's that guy who can have something really good going for him and he'll mess it up on purpose, content to live in his self-created misery.The ending...oh the ending. A previous reviewer called Kelly weak and I'm not sure I can agree with that statement. Every thing she did that night was planned. From her advice to what song she chose to sing last. Does it make her weak to want that? (It's hard trying to not give anything away). I've never been in that place where that character had to be so when it came down to it, I may not be /strong/ enough to do what she did. And never having been in that place, I can't even begin to imagine what her mental state was like. It took a lot of guts, in my opinion. Everyone one else were the weak ones because despite how much they all loved Kelly, they weren't strong enough to give her the strength she needed to make a different choice.Her husband's motives are somewhat clear and somewhat cloudy. Sometimes you get the impression that he wants to get things back to the way they were so that he may distance himself from being her husband and solely be her manager. Sometimes it seems that he wants to save her reputation--he knows that she's not going to really come back, but he doesn't want her fans to remember her for the tragedy that had happened the previous year. He's torn between caring for her and trying to make things right for her professionally. In the end, I think that their relationship is too broken and that there's no way they could ever get back to how they were when they first fell in love. And he knows that too, which is why he focuses too much on her career.Did I enjoy this movie? I'm not really sure. Overall, I felt like relationships (like Beau and Chiles) are so underdeveloped that the fact that it even exists in the film is an afterthought. For it to have been two hours long, I feel like they missed the mark on some things like that and spent too much time on other things. Beau and Chiles didn't have to have a relationship at all and the movie would have carried just the same without it--things like that.I will probably buy this one just for Garrett Hedlund and the beautiful music. To watch the cast be on the stage and the light sparkling in their eyes, that's something right there. It makes you want to stand up and sing along at the top of your lungs and go out and buy a guitar, even if you have no idea how to play it.",3,Is that what it means to be country strong?,1294444800,"01 8, 2011",2011,4115,"['went', 'movie', 'feeling', ""'d"", 'already', 'seen', 'previews', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'true', 'were', 'missing', 'pieces', 'one', 'shocking', 'ending', 'mostly', 'found', 'hard', 'like', 'characters', 'save', 'one', 'was', 'Chiles', 'who', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'innocent', 'felt', 'pity', 'Kelly', 'who', 'felt', 'way', 'knew', 'was', ""n't"", 'ready', 'title', 'was', ""n't"", 'strong', 'enough', 'make', 'anyone', 'listen', 'Beau', 'too', 'busy', 'being', 'completely', 'love', 'James', 'too', 'focused', 'trying', 'save', 'what', 'left', 'career', 'forget', 'past', 'be', 'completely', 'honest', 'think', 'Beau', 'was', 'character', 'disliked', 'most', 'ca', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'pinpoint', 'why', 'love', 'Garrett', 'Hedlund', 'think', 'part', 'well', 'something', 'character', 'rubbed', 'wrong', 'way', 'jerk', 'time', 'Chiles', 'only', 'really', 'nice', 'when', 'drunk', 'Then', 'constant', 'pull', 'feel', 'Chiles', 'supposed', 'be', 'having', 'affair', 'Kelly', ""'ll"", 'look', 'Chiles', 'same', 'puppy', 'dog', 'look', 'affection', 'eyes', 'Kelly', 'Now', 'possible', 'can', 'love', 'different', 'reasons', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'initially', 'attracted', 'Kelly', 'who', 'was', 'had', 'accomplished', 'later', 'grew', 'kind', 'protective', 'brotherly', 'love', 'Chiles', 'maybe', 'just', 'feel', 'alive', 'how', 'not', 'have', 'constantly', 'worry', 'what', 'doing', 'just', 'trying', 'make', 'sound', 'okay', 'head', 'where', ""'m"", 'standing', 'just', 'as', 'lost', 'everyone', 'else', 'just', 'many', 'issues', 'Hm', 'maybe', 'point', 'just', 'something', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'guy', 'who', 'can', 'have', 'something', 'really', 'good', 'going', ""'ll"", 'mess', 'up', 'purpose', 'content', 'live', 'self-created', 'misery.The', 'ending', 'ending', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'called', 'Kelly', 'weak', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'can', 'agree', 'statement', 'Every', 'thing', 'did', 'night', 'was', 'planned', 'advice', 'what', 'song', 'chose', 'sing', 'last', 'make', 'weak', 'want', 'hard', 'trying', 'not', 'give', 'anything', 'away', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'place', 'where', 'character', 'had', 'be', 'so', 'when', 'came', 'down', 'may', 'not', 'be', '/strong/', 'enough', 'do', 'what', 'did', 'never', 'having', 'been', 'place', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'imagine', 'what', 'mental', 'state', 'was', 'took', 'lot', 'guts', 'opinion', 'Everyone', 'one', 'were', 'weak', 'ones', 'how', 'much', 'loved', 'Kelly', 'were', ""n't"", 'strong', 'enough', 'give', 'strength', 'needed', 'make', 'different', 'choice.Her', 'husband', 'motives', 'are', 'somewhat', 'clear', 'somewhat', 'cloudy', 'Sometimes', 'get', 'impression', 'get', 'things', 'back', 'way', 'were', 'so', 'may', 'distance', 'being', 'husband', 'solely', 'be', 'manager', 'save', 'reputation', 'not', 'going', 'really', 'come', 'back', ""n't"", 'want', 'fans', 'remember', 'tragedy', 'had', 'happened', 'previous', 'year', 'torn', 'caring', 'trying', 'make', 'things', 'right', 'professionally', 'end', 'think', 'relationship', 'too', 'broken', 'way', 'could', 'ever', 'get', 'back', 'how', 'were', 'when', 'first', 'fell', 'love', 'too', 'why', 'too', 'much', 'career.Did', 'enjoy', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'Overall', 'felt', 'relationships', 'Beau', 'Chiles', 'are', 'so', 'underdeveloped', 'fact', 'even', 'film', 'afterthought', 'have', 'been', 'two', 'hours', 'long', 'feel', 'missed', 'mark', 'things', 'spent', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'other', 'things', 'Beau', 'Chiles', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'have', 'relationship', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'carried', 'just', 'same', 'things', 'that.I', 'will', 'probably', 'buy', 'one', 'just', 'Garrett', 'Hedlund', 'beautiful', 'music', 'watch', 'cast', 'be', 'stage', 'light', 'sparkling', 'eyes', 'something', 'right', 'there', 'want', 'stand', 'up', 'sing', 'along', 'top', 'lungs', 'go', 'out', 'buy', 'guitar', 'even', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'play']",N/A

It's a meditation on fame -- the intense, instantaneous, under-the-magnifying-glass, hothouse fame of the modern era -- set against the backdrop of the contemporary Nashville country music scene. Its strengths are in its presentation of how that fame feels to the performers under the spotlight - the overwhelming rush of applause, the blinding lights, the prying reporters, and how those intense emotions can both seduce and terrify those with talent.Gwyneth Paltrow plays a Martina McBride/Sara Evans-level country superstar wrestling with alcoholism and self-doubt; Leighton Meester is an up-and-coming, radio-ready pretty girl who is her rival in more ways than one.  Meanwhile, Garrett Hedlund plays Paltrow's rough-hewn, Waylon-esque protegee, a simple country guy who lives for the music, man, and not the fame. This is where the film falters: although the characters have unexpected ambiguities and flaws and the script takes some interesting turns, the dialogue is just terrible, full of leaden, naked exposition, where the plot is constantly explained to us in the most over-obvious terms: ""Honey, you can't make that bad decision because then you will lose your dream and everything you ever worked for.""  That kind of thing.  Hedlund's character is the weakest link in the film - he's pure and uncompromised, a talented musician poised on the brink of fame, but with clear enough vision to see how celebrity and show biz politics chews people up and spits them out; he'd rather keep singing in bars rather than go for the brass ring, even when fame is given to him on a silver plate.  It might look good on paper, but rings a bit false when seen on screen.Nonetheless, this movie is better than many other entries in the somewhat-thin genre of country music dramas -- not as gritty as ""Crazy Heart"" or ""Coal Miner's Daughter,"" but better produced than, say, ""Songwriter"" or ""Honeysuckle Rose."" Overall, I'd guess that this is a fairly accurate portrayal of what it's like behind-the-scenes on a modern country tour, with a few extra layers of melodrama on top.  Throughout, the made-for-the-movie music is top-notch, a completely convincing mix of revamped outlaw/honkytonk music and bombastic, hi-tech Nashville pop: any song in this film could easily be a radio hit. It's an okay movie, with some forced dialog and schmaltzy, on-the-nose plot points, but still with real country soul.  Worth checking out... I'd give it a 3.5 if I could.

1364173,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B003UESJ9M,Chris Pandolfi,"[9, 12]","""Country Strong"" is a fairly reliable celebrity drama, although it's not particularly original and it would have worked a lot better were it not for an unearned, shamelessly soapy ending. What surprised me was that I couldn't take the ending at face value. To be perfectly blunt, it made me angry. The events of the film don't build to this particular kind of conclusion, but more to the point, it made me rethink my feelings for the character involved, and not in a positive way. But I'm getting way ahead of the story; what builds up to the ending is standard relationship melodrama, a love triangle between an emotionally unstable country superstar, her conniving husband, and the honky-tonk hunk she has been having an affair with. There's also the up-and-coming singer who was once a beauty queen.It tells the story of Kelly Canter (Gwyneth Paltrow), an alcoholic country singer whose drinking led to a tragic accident. At the start of the film, she's prematurely taken of rehab by her husband/manager, James (Tim McGraw), who pressures her into embarking on a tour across Texas. As one observes the situation over the course of the film's 112 minutes, one cannot help but feel that James' motives have more to do with punishing his wife than with resurrecting her career. This isn't to suggest he lumbers into every scene with a big, evil scowl on his face. He channels his resentment professionally, setting her up with press conferences and interviews. For the most part, he keeps his emotions to himself, although there is a telling moment at a Make a Wish appearance; after dancing with Kelly for a moment, he breaks away from her, exits the room, and then starts crying in the hallway. His anger is understandable. His methods, however, are cruel and manipulative.Meanwhile, Kelly and James are accompanied by Kelly's lover, Beau Hutton (Garrett Hedlund), and Chiles Stanton (Leighton Meester), who wants to break into the county music scene. The former is a singer/songwriter who frequents dives, has a loyal following, and cares for the art of song more than the idea of fame. He met Kelly when he was working as an orderly while she was in rehab. He tags along under the preposterous notion that he's Kelly's sponsor. The latter is the young, idealistic beauty whose eyes sparkle with dreams of stardom. Beau describes her look as Country Barbie, and I kid you not, she takes that as a compliment. She's talented, but her reliance on her outward appearance is merely a coping mechanism for deep insecurities that stem from childhood. She knows of no other way to get attention other than looking beautiful.Beau and Chiles initially walk that fine line between antagonism and attraction, but rest assured, their relationship goes to the next level. This strikes me as somewhat odd, since it's obvious that he cares deeply for Kelly. It is, after all, he who calls James out on the pills he gave to Kelly. And rescued Kelly from a bar during a particularly bad relapse. And broke down the door to Kelly's dressing room at a crucial moment. Is it possible that this movie is really about a man who loves two women for different reasons? I hesitate to think the screenplay probes that deep. The actors all give decent performances, and yet they play little more than caricatures, and the drama on which the story is founded is so heightened that the whole thing comes off as a two-hour soap opera.The title refers to a state of mind; Kelly is told that she can do anything because she's country strong, which I guess is somehow different from general strength. It doesn't matter - the ending makes it abundantly clear that she possesses absolutely no strength, country or otherwise. This character seriously let me down; I felt like a boy whose parent reneged on a promise to be at his baseball game. I also felt cheated, since the events of the film gave no indication that its conclusion would be the only appropriate one. So far as I can tell, the ending was included merely as a way to create more drama.To give writer/director Shana Feste some credit, her casting choices were spot on. This is evident in both the performances and in the actors' singing voices; Paltrow in particular owns every song she sings, pretty much to the point that it's a mystery why she hasn't pursued a career in singing or musical theater. Hedlund is also a convincing singer - perhaps this movie is his apology for ""Tron: Legacy.""

They'll rave about some major twist, some great final sequence, but totally forget a bunch of stupid stuff prior. That being said, I am attempting not to be the complete opposite type of person while applying my same overall principle - because my instinct wants to completely pan Country Strong for what is certainly one of the worst movie endings I've seen in quite some time...maybe ever. I need to judge the film as a whole, so let's get to it then...Country Strong is the story of three country singers. One, Kelly Cantor (Gwenyth Paltrow), is a seasoned singer whose part Faith Hill and part Lindsay Lohan. The movie begins with her leaving rehab (for alcohol abuse), forced to leave early by her angry (or misunderstood?) husband/manager (Tim McGraw) who seemingly wants to see her back on the road making money. While in rehab, she met an up-and-coming star who worked in the facility, who coincidentally also knows another up-and-coming star who coincidentally Cantor's husband is looking into to be a new opening act, coincidentally. Coincidentally. Coincidentally. My word the beginning of this movie was almost as bad as the end. There is so much cooking here, and almost none of it is believable.In the middle though, once we forgive all of the coincidences, the story hits it's stride and becomes, dare I say it, immensely entertaining. The music wasn't half bad for the amount of original material they made for the film. I actually began really liking the characters - the acting was very good, and I thought I might end up liking the overall experience. And then the last five minutes happen. My word. So terrible. I'm sorry, this review is not eloquent, but it's just that bad. The screenwriter/director, Shana Feste, should be utterly ashamed how she betrayed the overall message of the movie in the last few scenes. This was supposed to be a movie about redemption, not some bad soap opera.

1364180,A3HM5G9IV1FTFP,B003UESJ9M,Douglas King,"[3, 4]","""Country Strong"" is yet another example of how a film with a mediocre script can sometimes be elevated by a great performance. In this case, the performer is Gwyneth Paltrow, who portrays troubled country music superstar Kelly Canter. In the beginning of the film, Canter is in rehab following a tragic public meltdown, and is taken out early by her manager/husband, James, who is eager to put Kelly back on the road to reclaim her once stellar career. In rehab, Kelly had become romantically involved with Beau, a younger singer-songwriter, and Kelly insists that her husband allow Beau to open for her on her tour. Since James has already committed to making aspiring singer Chiles Kelly's opening act, the three musicians all end up going on the road together, and the four main characters become entangled in a plethora of romantic and non-romantic drama.Paltrow is no stranger to playing self-destructive, troubled characters (she did play Sylvia Plath, after all), so I wasn't surprised at how well she pulls off her character's messy, volatile side. What did surprise me was how well Paltrow was able to portray a country music superstar. Paltrow, who is Hollywood royalty with a penchant for playing characters with British accents, is as far removed from a country girl as they come. And yet she is absolutely stunning at the climax of the film, when her character performs her triumphant comeback concert, and Paltrow is able to believably portray a superstar singer, wowing an audience of thousands of adoring fans, radiating charisma. It's long been known that Paltrow could sing, but her ability to actually perform as a singer is impressive.Regarding the rest of the cast, the results vary. Garrett Hedlund shows mega-watt leading man charisma as Beau, and handled the musical scenes quite well. But he perhaps relies a little too much on his charm and fails to connect with the character's supposed inner conflicts. Similarly, Leighton Meester is cute and charming and has a good singing voice, but never effectively shows her character's ambition and desire to run away from her troubled past.The whole film has the feel of a higher-end made for TV movie, full of pretty people with plenty of soapy melodrama. The film succeeds mostly as a showcase for Gwyneth Paltrow's acting and singing chops, and Garrett Hedlund's star quality.",3,Showcase,1302912000,"04 16, 2011",2011,2348,"['Country', 'Strong', 'yet', 'example', 'how', 'film', 'mediocre', 'script', 'can', 'sometimes', 'be', 'elevated', 'great', 'performance', 'case', 'performer', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'who', 'troubled', 'country', 'music', 'superstar', 'Kelly', 'Canter', 'beginning', 'film', 'Canter', 'rehab', 'following', 'tragic', 'public', 'meltdown', 'taken', 'out', 'early', 'manager/husband', 'James', 'who', 'eager', 'put', 'Kelly', 'back', 'road', 'reclaim', 'once', 'stellar', 'career', 'rehab', 'Kelly', 'had', 'become', 'romantically', 'involved', 'Beau', 'younger', 'singer-songwriter', 'Kelly', 'husband', 'allow', 'Beau', 'open', 'tour', 'James', 'already', 'committed', 'making', 'aspiring', 'singer', 'Chiles', 'Kelly', 'opening', 'act', 'three', 'musicians', 'end', 'up', 'going', 'road', 'together', 'four', 'main', 'characters', 'become', 'entangled', 'plethora', 'romantic', 'non-romantic', 'drama.Paltrow', 'stranger', 'playing', 'self-destructive', 'troubled', 'characters', 'did', 'play', 'Sylvia', 'Plath', 'so', 'was', ""n't"", 'surprised', 'how', 'well', 'character', 'messy', 'volatile', 'side', 'What', 'did', 'surprise', 'was', 'how', 'well', 'Paltrow', 'was', 'able', 'portray', 'country', 'music', 'superstar', 'Paltrow', 'who', 'Hollywood', 'royalty', 'penchant', 'playing', 'characters', 'British', 'accents', 'far', 'removed', 'country', 'girl', 'come', 'yet', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'climax', 'film', 'when', 'character', 'triumphant', 'comeback', 'concert', 'Paltrow', 'able', 'believably', 'portray', 'superstar', 'singer', 'wowing', 'audience', 'thousands', 'adoring', 'fans', 'radiating', 'charisma', 'long', 'been', 'known', 'Paltrow', 'could', 'sing', 'ability', 'actually', 'perform', 'singer', 'impressive.Regarding', 'rest', 'cast', 'results', 'vary', 'Garrett', 'Hedlund', 'mega-watt', 'leading', 'man', 'charisma', 'Beau', 'handled', 'musical', 'scenes', 'quite', 'well', 'perhaps', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'charm', 'connect', 'character', 'supposed', 'inner', 'conflicts', 'Similarly', 'Leighton', 'Meester', 'cute', 'charming', 'good', 'singing', 'voice', 'never', 'effectively', 'character', 'ambition', 'desire', 'run', 'away', 'troubled', 'past.The', 'whole', 'film', 'feel', 'higher-end', 'made', 'TV', 'movie', 'full', 'pretty', 'people', 'plenty', 'soapy', 'melodrama', 'film', 'mostly', 'showcase', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'acting', 'singing', 'chops', 'Garrett', 'Hedlund', 'star', 'quality']",N/A

But this time the story remains low key, in part because of the quality of the actors involved, and the theme of 'what is more important, fame or love'? manages to hold on throughout this overly long film.  Shana Feste both wrote and directed this story of a life gone sour and the effects that has on those who care about her.Kelly Canter (Gweneth Paltrow) is a country singer superstar who has a problem with alcohol and drugs and carries with her the devastating loss of her unborn child due to a fall during a concert in Dallas some years back.  She is married to her manager James (Tim McGraw) who struggles with Kelly's addiction, consents to rehab where she meets young Beau Hutton (Garrett Hedlund), an aspiring country singer and talented songwriter,  but James pulls her out early to that she can make a comeback after a series of embarrassing flubbed shows.  James seems more obsessed with Kelly's career than with her emotional stability.  Once out  Kelly and Beau continue seeing each other and because of his talent Beau is added to the Kelly's tour as an opening act.  Along for the ride is a naive ex-beauty queen Chiles Syanyon (Leighton Meester) who idolizes Kelly and strives to get an audition with the famous diva. James hears her, invites her along as an audience pleaser, but on the tour, Beau and Chiles become involved: Beau just want to sing his songs to little bar crowds who love music and plans to move  to California, asking Chiles to join him.  But Chiles is star struck and opts for following in Kelly's advice and tracks until a tragedy occurs and alter the lives of Beau, Chiles, James, and the country music fans.The moral seems to be that love and work can't make good bedfellows and the story seems out to prove that.  The plot gets a bit sappy towards the end but the film itself is salvaged by the singing of Garrett Hedlund and Leighton Meester.  Paltrow offers some of her own songs, but oddly enough the true country star - Tim McGraw - never  sings!  There are some strong performances in this tearjerker - from each of the four leads.

1364186,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B003UESJ9M,Haunted Flower,"[7, 17]","""Country Strong"" was written and directed by Shana Feste (would I have called her ""Shan-like-Shannon-a-Fest-y? Who knows...). ] This movie had a lot of possibilities and I wanted to like it. We know from past experiences with ""Ray"", ""Walk the Line"", and ""Crazy Heart"", that stories of musicians dealing with fame and all the problems that come with it in relationships and their own health equal lots of notice come awards time! Obviously the stories based on actual artists fare a little better since all that came out of ""Crazy Heart"" was the recognition by the Academy that Jeff Bridges has been around for many years and The Dude can act. And not just when he's being a hippie. But it does help when he gets to be an alcoholic. My early prediction for this coming year is that the Best Actor award will go to James Franco playing the young man who lost a fight with a damn big rock in ""127 Hours.""Anyway, I'm still talking about ""Country Strong"", right? Maybe this store brand Dayquil is kicking in a little hard. Here are things almost every musician movie, country, rock, or otherwise has in common: A) Alcohol and/or Drug Dependence, B) Infidelity, Sleeping around, C) Pull a stupid stunt onstage and embarrass yourself, fall from grace, D) Rehab.The premise is that Gwyneth Paltrow plays a country star named Kelly Canter who has a bunch of Grammies and she's an alcoholic who has been in rehab (ding, ding, ding, that's two for two!). Her husband and manager, James is played by Tim McGraw who has become quite a good actor. He did really well in ""The Blind Side"" and this role is much tougher. We find out rather early on that what put her in rehab was being drunk and falling offstage at a show in Dallas (Whoa, that's three for four already). He decides to pull her from rehab a month early to set up a three date tour (does this count as a tour? 3 days??) that will end in a highly televised return to Dallas to prove everyone wrong. Unfortunately, Kelly is a fragile little flower that the tiniest thing can set off and have her running to makeup smearing boozing that never felt believable.While in rehab, she was ""taken care of"" if you know what I mean by Beau Hutton played by Garrett Hedlund. Why is that face so familiar? You just saw him in ""Tron: Legacy."" This is what he looks like with facial hair and holding a guitar! Gotta say this is a face and voice to win the ladies over, no question about it. In fact, the majority of the movie the camera is panning over his face smiling longingly at some girl so this movie is really more Beau's movie than any other character. Due to Beau's past with James' wife in rehab and his own country music talent in the local bar, he gets the privilege of getting to open for Kelly on this tour along with Chiles Stanton played by Leighton Meester (of ""Gossip Girl"", XOXO). Chiles is a beautiful girl, her claim to fame she totes around is being a former Miss Dallas, but she is shy to sing onstage until interactions with the blue-eyed, Beau help her gain confidence and she holds tight to the reins of her career (oh great, a horseback riding joke, what'll she think up next?).Ok, so Kelly is married to James. James can barely look at her as a husband. Kelly is having an affair with Beau obviously. Beau loves her but can't help but start to like the innocent and age appropriate Chiles. Kelly is jealous that Chiles is young and pretty and might get the attention of James. This goes beyond a love triangle, this is a well organized love square. (ding, ding, infidelity, four for four!)I really liked the relationship between Kelly and James onscreen with all its complexity and there was occasional charm to the relationship between Kelly and Beau though it was definitely lacking. The relationship between Beau and Chiles was pretty cute and had potential. The problem is that there are TOO many relationships!! They all suffer for being stuffed together like this. The hilarious thing is, while all the characters appear to know what is going on, they very rarely talk about it. They just want to get to Dallas.The biggest letdown of the movie if Gwyneth Paltrow's character, Kelly. You never have a reason to want her to get better or cheer for her. You get tiny glimpses of what might have made James fall in love with her in the first place, but it's hard to figure out how the fans ever embraced her. She's actually more of a supporting role even though the movie is supposed to be about her, but I guess she's the only reason the other three characters are there. She never even sings a full song until practically the end of the movie since she keeps screwing it up with booze (while Beau and Chiles have each sang a TON) and you start wondering if she ever will. And I have to give credit to my friend, Austin Lugar at TheFilmYap.com with making this comparision: Remember that scene in ""Get Him to the Greek"" where the rock star after the long journey finally does his opening song, ""I'm Coming Up"" and the lights go up? THAT, my friends, THAT had more emotional build up than Kelly finally singing at her Dallas concert with the movie title song, ""Country Strong."" Wow. By that point, you just don't care about her anymore and I was of the attitude that if she didn't start singing now at the end of the movie, I just wanted to kick her or get one of those giant canes to pull her offstage.The other thing that bugs me is audience reactions during the songs. They only have two levels. On and off. When you are at a concert with an opening act you have never heard of and songs you have never heard before, you don't suddenly cheer like it's the Super Bowl and sing along. No gradual warming up to the artists, just full blown cheering or crickets chirping. No inbetween there. The extras could have used a little coaching.Some of the songs were pretty good and this is coming from a girl who is not a huge fan of country music and I still have ""Give In To Me"" stuck in my head today. You might be better off skipping the movie and picking up the soundtrack, but I'd call this a rental. It is not going to get Awards buzz which is why it was pushed back to a January 7th release date instead of getting in before the end of 2010. The three ""supporting"" (i.e. main) characters are pretty decent in their own respects, but Gwyneth Paltrow spends far too much of this movie in a haze that doesn't give us enough to root for.Oh, and you totally see the ending coming a mile away. That's all I'm sayin'.",2,"Music Strong, Individual Relationships ok, Movie = Weak",1294704000,"01 11, 2011",2011,6474,"['Country', 'Strong', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'Shana', 'Feste', 'would',

1364187,A3LEVA2HQW2CKF,B003UESJ9M,HD Eyes,"[4, 7]","I just got through watching this movie. I have been looking forward in seeing this picture ever since I saw Gweneth Paltrow sing on the TV Show Glee. When it comes to the music in this movie I think they did a really good job. While I did enjoy the music, the film lacked a strong storyline and character development. I kept comparing this film the classic film The Rose, which starred Bette Midler. By the end of the film, any comparison between the two movies completely died. While in The Rose, you have such a messed up person but you felt sorry for her. At the end of that film you sat there speechless because it was such a strong and emotional movie, not like Country Strong. In this movie you have another woman who is a mega country star. She is in rehab for drinking and pills. Her Manager Husband is a no good heartless person. Paltrows character though played well by her, lacks any emotion or sympathy due to the weak script and lack of character development. She falls for and up and coming country singer Beau and blows things with him. This movie could have been so much better is it had a better stronger script. The music was fine. The acting was very good. The script and character development ruined this film. I hope Ms. Paltrow continues to sing because she actually is pretty good.

1364188,AL8IDHJPCE00K,B003UESJ9M,H,"[13, 14]","I love music, and country music. I also love a lot of the actors and actresses in the movie so I went expecting a ""Pure Country"" or even a ""Coal Miner's Daughter"" kind of movie.Instead I got a movie with some exceptional acting, great music, and an amazing story.I will first make a comparrison:Love and Other Drugs was similiar in that it deals with a lot of human element and complexities. However, that movie was so OVERLY sexual that it watered down the emotion. And while I love Anne Hathaway and thought she did some great acting I didn't like her character. In the end I didn't think he character developed and still felt like her character was very selfish and that they both were. It was a very co-dependent relationship.Country Strong was so much more. It was what I wanted Love and Other drugs to be. (Spoiler Alert) You wont' find a happy ending here but the complex story of Kelly Canter won't leave my mind. Paltrow was a perfect pic for this character as she almost has a sadness in her eyes, a certain quality.Kelly Canter is a famous celebrity who's lost her way in life. After losing a baby when she fell of stage during a concert (she tripped over a mic cord, but she was intoxicated) she goes to rehab where she stays for about a year. James Canter, her husband checks her out early from rehab to help her get her career back. Kelly'd not ready to leave rehab and a friend who works at the rehab and sings at local bars and dance halls comes on tour with her- Beau.Kelly Canter is now KELLY CANTER. Her entire being is her ""celebrity"" and she's no longer herself anymore. All she really wants is for James to love her. She longs to escape the life she's living but when she tries to talk to James about this he refuses to see the real Kelly anymore.There's so much pain between them, and you watch Kelly's life jump off the tracks and spiral out of control. It's very painful at times. James and Kelly have a complex relationship that's become more about business and more about KELLY CANTER the headliner than Kelly Canter the woman. Kelly continues to make bad choices and it's clear she's had a mental breakdown. Only Beau can see this and while he's in love with her all of her demons push him away.Meanwhile Chiles Stanton (Leighton Meester who does a great job) is the pageant queen girl trying to break in to stardom. She turns out to be more complex than she seems on the surface and in the end Beau falls for her. She wants the limelight though and wants to be the next Kelly Canter. Beau gets a taste of it and decides it's not for him. He can see what fame has done to Kelly. How it steals every piece of you. He just loves music and wants to go back to singing in dance halls.James Canter will push Kelly at any cost. His love for Kelly has become so entagled in his desire for her to suceed and be KELLY CANTER that he can't see how broken she is. ""She use to be strong. I don't know when she became so fragile."" he says to Beau.There is such a struggle in this movie between two people who love each other and hurt each other in so many ways. It shows how complex a marriage can be. How complex the ""celebrity"" personality can be and how even those close to you can blur the lines between real and pretend.You'll find hope at the end of the movie when two characters decide to leave that life behind. Unfortunately you'll also find pain and sadness, when sometimes it's just too late.There is not a character in this movie that is not deeply complex. You're heart will break and bleed for them even as you watch them hurt each other and make avoidable mistakes. These characters too do selfish things to one another but what will stay with you is the pain that love can cause when it won't let go.You'll see the intensity that is so hard to show between two people as you peel back the layers on James and Kelly's marriage.",5,Best movie I've seen in a long time,1295222400,"01 17, 2011",2011,3857,"['love', 'music', 'country', 'music', 'also', 'love', 'lot', 'actors', 'actresses', 'movie', 'so', 'went', 'expecting', 'Pure', 'Country', 'even', 'Coal', 'Miner', 'Daughter', 'kind', 'movie.Instead', 'got', 'movie', 'exceptional', 'acting', 'great', 'music', 'amazing', 'story.I', 'will', 'first', 'make', 'comparrison', 'Love', 'Other', 'Drugs', 'was', 'similiar', 'lot', 'human', 'element', 'complexities', 'However', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'OVERLY', 'sexual', 'watered', 'down', 'emotion', 'love', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'thought', 'did', 'great', 'acting', 'did', ""n't"", 'character', 'end', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'character', 'developed', 'still', 'felt', 'character', 'was', 'very', 'selfish', 'were', 'was', 'very', 'co-dependent', 'relationship.Country', 'Strong', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'was', 'what', 'wanted', 'Love', 'Other', 'drugs', 'be', 'Spoiler', 'Alert', 'wont', 'find', 'happy', 'ending', 'here', 'complex', 'story', 'Kelly', 'Canter', 'wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'mind', 'Paltrow', 'was', 'perfect', 'pic', 'character', 'almost', 'sadness', 'eyes', 'certain', 'quality.Kelly', 'Canter', 'famous', 'celebrity', 'who', 'lost', 'way', 'life', 'losing', 'baby', 'when', 'fell', 'stage', 'concert', 'tripped', 'mic', 'cord', 'was', 'intoxicated', 'rehab', 'where', 'year', 'James', 'Canter', 'husband', 'out', 'early', 'rehab', 'help', 'get', 'career', 'back', 'Kelly', ""'d"", 'not', 'ready', 'leave', 'rehab', 'friend', 'who', 'rehab', 'sings', 'local', 'bars', 'dance', 'halls', 'tour', 'her-', 'Beau.Kelly', 'Canter', 'now', 'KELLY', 'CANTER', 'entire', 'being', 'celebrity', 'no', 'longer', 'anymore', 'really', 'James', 'love', 'escape', 'life', 'living', 'when', 'talk', 'James', 'see', 'real', 'Kelly', 'so', 'much', 'pain', 'watch', 'Kelly', 'life', 'jump', 'tracks', 'spiral', 'control', 'very', 'painful', 'times', 'James', 'Kelly', 'have', 'complex', 'relationship', 'become', 'more', 'business', 'more', 'KELLY', 'CANTER', 'headliner', 'Kelly', 'Canter', 'woman', 'Kelly', 'make', 'bad', 'choices', 'clear', 'had', 'mental', 'breakdown', 'Only', 'Beau', 'can', 'see', 'love', 'demons', 'push', 'away.Meanwhile', 'Chiles', 'Stanton', 'Leighton', 'Meester', 'who', 'great', 'job', 'pageant', 'queen', 'girl', 'trying', 'break', 'stardom', 'out', 'be', 'more', 'complex', 'surface', 'end', 'Beau', 'limelight', 'be', 'next', 'Kelly', 'Canter', 'Beau', 'taste', 'not', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'fame', 'done', 'Kelly', 'How', 'piece', 'just', 'music', 'go', 'back', 'singing', 'dance', 'halls.James', 'Canter', 'will', 'push', 'Kelly', 'cost', 'love', 'Kelly', 'become', 'so', 'entagled', 'desire', 'suceed', 'be', 'KELLY', 'CANTER', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'broken', 'use', 'be', 'strong', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'became', 'so', 'fragile', 'Beau.There', 'such', 'struggle', 'movie', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'other', 'hurt', 'other', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'how', 'complex', 'marriage', 'can', 'be', 'How', 'complex', 'celebrity', 'personality', 'can', 'be', 'how', 'even', 'close', 'can', 'blur', 'lines', 'real', 'pretend.You', ""'ll"", 'find', 'hope', 'end', 'movie', 'when', 'two', 'characters', 'decide', 'leave', 'life', 'Unfortunately', ""'ll"", 'also', 'find', 'pain', 'sadness', 'when', 'just', 'too', 'late.There', 'not', 'character', 'movie', 'not', 'deeply', 'complex', ""'re"", 'heart', 'will', 'break', 'bleed', 'even', 'watch', 'hurt', 'other', 'make', 'avoidable', 'mistakes', 'characters', 'too', 'do', 'selfish', 'things', 'one', 'what', 'will', 'stay', 'pain', 'love', 'can', 'cause', 'when', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'go.You', ""'ll"", 'see', 'intensity', 'so', 'hard', 'show', 'two', 'people', 'peel', 'back', 'layers', 'James', 'Kelly', 'marriage']",N/A
1364189,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B003UESJ9M,Jason,"[1, 2]","Recently released from a rehab facility, Kelly (Paltrow) is essentially the Nashville Lindsay Lohan.  A drunk, pill-popper.  Pretty much exactly like Lohan, except more pretentious and irritating.  Anyway, she limps through a comeback to Grammy-level music, despite the fact she's less talented than Dewey Cox and her singing voice is similar to Marlee Matlin's.  While managing to alienate her husband (Tim McGraw), cheat on with with her rehab sponsor, struggling singer Beau (Garrett Hedlund), and embarrass herself in front of one of the few disillusioned fans she has left - Chiles Stanton (Leighton Meester), another up-and-coming country artist - she also manages to make viewers, those of her country performances and most who watched the movie, dislike her immensely.Hedlund and Meester provide the best performances, impersonating country singers quite well.  I've been to The Stage on Broadway in Nashville, and while it's certainly more crowded than portrayed in the movie, Hedlund sounds like someone who could play there regularly.  Tim McGraw once again turns in a nuanced performance, even though the source material is right in his wheelhouse.  A lot was made of Paltrow actually singing in the film, but the singing ends up being very unimpressive, which is consistent with the rest of her performance.  And frankly, most of her movies.  She was at most the third best singer on screen, and that's only because McGraw never dropped a note.  In a sort of schadenfreudian way, I enjoyed disliking Paltrow in this movie, but it's still not as good as her role in Se7en, but that's because her head ends up in a box and we don't have to listen to her condescending tone and self-righteous thoughst.The title is very misleading, and anyone looking for strength in this film should look elsewhere.  Just like the stereotypical country song, this is a sob-in-your-beer, love-triangle tale missing only the hound dog, the decrepit pickup, a case of Natty Lite, and actual, believable emotion.",2,She's Actin' Single and I'm Drinkin' Doubles,1351123200,"10 25, 2012",2012,2002,"['Recently', 'released', 'rehab', 'facility', 'Kelly', 'Paltrow', 'essentially', 'Nashville', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'A', 'drunk', 'pill-popper', 'Pretty', 'much', 'exactly', 'Lohan', 'more', 'pretentious', 'irritating', 'Anyway', 'comeback', 'Grammy-level', 'music', 'fact', 'less', 'talented', 'Dewey', 'Cox', 'singing', 'voice', 'similar', 'Marlee', 'Matlin', 'managing', 'alienate', 'husband', 'Tim', 'McGraw', 'cheat', 'rehab', 'sponsor', 'struggling', 'singer', 'Beau', 'Garrett', 'Hedlund', 'embarrass', 'front', 'one', 'few', 'disillusioned', 'fans', 'left', 'Chiles', 'Stanton', 'Leighton', 'Meester', 'up-and-coming', 'country', 'artist', 'also', 'make', 'viewers', 'country', 'performances', 'most', 'who', 'watched', 'movie', 'immensely.Hedlund', 'Meester', 'provide', 'best', 'performances', 'impersonating', 'country', 'singers', 'quite', 'well', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Stage', 'Broadway', 'Nashville', 'certainly', 'more', 'crowded', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'Hedlund', 'someone', 'who', 'could', 'play', 'there', 'regularly', 'Tim', 'McGraw', 'once', 'again', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'even', 'source', 'material', 'right', 'wheelhouse', 'lot', 'was', 'made', 'Paltrow', 'actually', 'singing', 'film', 'singing', 'up', 'being', 'very', 'unimpressive', 'consistent', 'rest', 'performance', 'frankly', 'most', 'movies', 'was', 'most', 'third', 'best', 'singer', 'screen', 'only', 'McGraw', 'never', 'dropped', 'note', 'sort', 'schadenfreudian', 'way', 'enjoyed', 'disliking', 'Paltrow', 'movie', 'still', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'role', 'Se7en', 'head', 'up', 'box', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'listen', 'condescending', 'tone', 'self-righteous', 'thoughst.The', 'title', 'very', 'misleading', 'anyone', 'looking', 'strength', 'film', 'should', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'Just', 'stereotypical', 'country', 'song', 'sob-in-your-beer', 'love-triangle', 'tale', 'missing', 'only', 'hound', 'dog', 'decrepit', 'pickup', 'case', 'Natty', 'Lite', 'actual', 'believable', 'emotion']",N/A
1364190,A10BWW5GU19AD,B003UESJ9M,Jeff Wiley,"[71, 74]","Kelly Canter (portrayed by Gwyneth Paltrow) is one of the biggest country music stars on the planet, and she's also struggling with many demons.  A year after a tragic (and very public) accident in Dallas derailed her career, Kelly has emerged from rehab, and is quickly sent back on the road by her husband-manager James (Tim McGraw).  James, who is now more Kelly's manager than husband, recruits a singing beauty queen named Chiles Stanton (Leighton Meester)  to join Kelly's ""Encore"" tour.  Kelly, enamored during her rehab stint with a musically talented intern named Beau Hutton (Garrett Hedlund), insists that he supports Kelly on the tour, as well.  James agrees, but only on the condition that Beau's role is sponsor first, musician second.  The complex layers of relationships among the main characters is the essence of 'Country Strong'.All of the actors turn in very convincing performances, Hedlund's not the least among them.  Hedlund's turn as a gifted musician more in love with music than with the idea of fame is second only to Paltrow's authentic depiction of the troubled superstar.  McGraw gets better with every role that he receives, although his character range might be limited.  Meester's interpretation of the ""Country Barbie"" has legs, and healthy ones at that.  Her character was the most well developed in the film, start to finish.As the writing goes, I found it to be a little sloppy.  The emotional pendulum swings so quickly and frantically among the characters, that it becomes difficult to get invested in even one of them, let alone all of them.  The story is not difficult to follow, but some instances of interaction are questionable, if not unbelievable.  There are also elements surrounding the film that even make it feel a little dated.  That said, I did find the pacing of the film to be solid and steady.  I also found the victories and defeats that the characters experience I found to be a plus for the movie.The true strength of 'Country Strong' is the music that is woven throughout the fabric of the story.  The variety of country music sub-genres (from classic country to the current, dominant pop-style of country) are all great, and I consider myself a casual country music fan, at best.  The real tragedy is that not all of the songs in the film are on the official soundtrack.  Paltrow has at least three top-quality songs in the film, all of which she performs herself.  She sounds like someone who has been performing country her entire life.  Meester's ""Words I Couldn't Say"", which she also performs on her own, is potentially a #1 single for her.  It's really that good.  Overall, this might actually be an instance where the soundtrack will outlast the popularity of the movie it originates from.'Country Strong' amounted to something of a predictable ending, but knowing the destination didn't make the journey any less worth taking for me.  As I type this, Rotten Tomatoes critics have this film at 17%.  I find this rating to be very unfair, and very harsh.  This is an entertaining film that will satisfy the majority of those who spend their money to see it.",4,"Slightly disjointed, but still enjoyable film",1294531200,"01 9, 2011",2011,3124,"['Kelly', 'Canter', 'portrayed', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'one', 'biggest', 'country', 'music', 'stars', 'planet', 'also', 'struggling', 'many', 'demons', 'year', 'tragic', 'very', 'public', 'accident', 'Dallas', 'derailed', 'career', 'Kelly', 'emerged', 'rehab', 'quickly', 'sent', 'back', 'road', 'husband-manager', 'James', 'Tim', 'McGraw', 'James', 'who', 'now', 'more', 'Kelly', 'manager', 'husband', 'singing', 'beauty', 'queen', 'named', 'Chiles', 'Stanton', 'Leighton', 'Meester', 'join', 'Kelly', 'Encore', 'tour', 'Kelly', 'enamored', 'rehab', 'stint', 'musically', 'talented', 'intern', 'named', 'Beau', 'Hutton', 'Garrett', 'Hedlund', 'Kelly', 'tour', 'as', 'well', 'James', 'only', 'condition', 'Beau', 'role', 'sponsor', 'first', 'musician', 'second', 'complex', 'layers', 'relationships', 'main', 'characters', 'essence', ""'Country"", ""Strong'.All"", 'actors', 'turn', 'very', 'convincing', 'performances', 'Hedlund', 'not', 'least', 'Hedlund', 'turn', 'gifted', 'musician', 'more', 'love', 'music', 'idea', 'fame', 'second', 'only', 'Paltrow', 'authentic', 'depiction', 'troubled', 'superstar', 'McGraw', 'better', 'role', 'character', 'range', 'might', 'be', 'limited', 'Meester', 'interpretation', 'Country', 'Barbie', 'legs', 'healthy', 'ones', 'character', 'was', 'most', 'well', 'developed', 'film', 'start', 'finish.As', 'writing', 'found', 'be', 'little', 'sloppy', 'emotional', 'pendulum', 'swings', 'so', 'quickly', 'frantically', 'characters', 'difficult', 'get', 'invested', 'even', 'one', 'let', 'alone', 'story', 'not', 'difficult', 'follow', 'instances', 'interaction', 'are', 'questionable', 'not', 'unbelievable', 'are', 'also', 'elements', 'surrounding', 'film', 'even', 'make', 'feel', 'little', 'dated', 'said', 'did', 'find', 'pacing', 'film', 'be', 'solid', 'steady', 'also', 'found', 'victories', 'defeats', 'characters', 'experience', 'found', 'be', 'plus', 'movie.The', 'true', 'strength', ""'Country"", 'Strong', 'music', 'woven', 'fabric', 'story', 'variety', 'country', 'music', 'sub-genres', 'classic', 'country', 'current', 'dominant', 'pop-style', 'country', 'are', 'great', 'consider', 'casual', 'country', 'music', 'fan', 'best', 'real', 'tragedy', 'not', 'songs', 'film', 'are', 'official', 'soundtrack', 'Paltrow', 'least', 'three', 'top-quality', 'songs', 'film', 'someone', 'who', 'been', 'performing', 'country', 'entire', 'life', 'Meester', 'Words', 'Could', ""n't"", 'Say', 'also', 'own', 'potentially', '1', 'single', 'really', 'good', 'Overall', 'might', 'actually', 'be', 'instance', 'where', 'soundtrack', 'will', 'outlast', 'popularity', 'movie', ""'Country"", 'Strong', 'amounted', 'something', 'predictable', 'ending', 'knowing', 'destination', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'journey', 'less', 'worth', 'taking', 'type', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', 'critics', 'have', 'film', '17', '%', 'find', 'rating', 'be', 'very', 'unfair', 'very', 'harsh', 'entertaining', 'film', 'will', 'satisfy', 'majority', 'who', 'spend', 'money', 'see']",N/A

Well...you know how every DVD has all kinds of praise from people you don't know on the cover. That's all that is. If you're country it's a strong movie. If you're city it's the wrong movie.This is a pretty good movie and it gets 5-stars if you live in Tennessee and it gets 1-star if you are from New York.There is no denying the fact Gwyneth Paltrow is one of the greatest actors of all time just for the fact very few actors can turn in a legit redneck performance. It takes a redneck to know one and my straw hat is off to Gwyneth. She must have had a dialect coach that grew up watching Hee Haw and the Beverly Hillbillies. It's the greatest redneck performance by a non-redneck of all-time! She's a Skoal dipping surfer chick now. A mobile meth lab away from hanging out at the cement pond with Elly May and Jethro.Here's the entire story. Gwyneth is a former country star that freaks out, gets drunk and old. Her husband don't want her no more. She wants a young singer to curl up in bed with after a hard night of drinking and her husband wants the same thing. Predictible relationship twists and turns. The end.Tim McGraw plays the husband of a 40-something year old still hot former country music star. Something he does in real life everyday. McGraw is good in the role of ""Husband"" to 40-something chicks in movies. It's just his role. He's good at it.The old skool country music is really great in this movie but if you don't like country don't bother. The entire movie looks like it was filmed in and around the Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, a hotel room, a tour bus and a bar. By that I mean it could have all been done in the same 1/4 of a mile radius with some stock road sign footage added. Not a lot of scenery that's going to ""pop"" on the Blu Ray.It's like you got some really top of the line cameras, your best female friend was a great actor, everyone else was just glad to be there, you wrote a decent script but didn't have enough money to travel so you stayed in one spot in one Tennessee town and made a movie.Country Strong couldn't carry Coal Miner's Daughter's spitcup but it would look good with it in a DVD two-pack at Wal-Mart.",3,If you're country it's a strong movie.

I also like Gwyneth Paltrow and Tim McGraw. Both great actors.What little I knew of the movie was that it was about a country singer Kelly Canter, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, coming out of rehab for alcohol addiction. Her husband and manger, played by Tim McGraw, is driven to push Kelly to her limit to become a success in her music career.I didn't known Gwyneth sang, and was surprised to discover that not only does she sing, but she's quite good. But Gwyneth wasn't the only one who could sing. A second set of characters had their own storyline.The slow growing romance between Chilies Stanton, played by Leighton Meester, and Beau Hutton, played by Garrett Hedlund, will warm your heart as you are taken along on their compelling stories. I thought the main focus would be on Gwyneth's character, Kelly, which in part was why the added story of Chiles and Beau was such a pleasant surprise. Their back-story, their growing romance, and great voices had me wanting a story of their own. With Leighton's beautiful voice, and Garrett's unique gravely sound, purchasing the soundtrack is a must.COUNTRY STRONG was a great movie but what really won me over was the ending.

Have always felt the monotone twang, and 4 note limit-range octaves pretty dreary -- and to have lasted so long in America, at the expense of other previous music, is plain astonishing.  But if this is country, I'm ready to go with it.The film, if it has flaws, is that I really could have used about two more script pages of ""explaining"" what the heck is going on!  As it goes, we get only bits and pieces.  Not all the characters motives are clearly outlined or defined.  And that is where it could have been so much better.  Yet the unraveling slices we see, are a range of such depth and complexity, it sometimes/always keeps you wondering.  And wanting more.But for the characters in it, this has to be an all-round bravado set of performances.  Miss Paltrow, as sharp and crisp, as I've never seen her before; Tim McGraw an absolute presence of solid restraint, and final vulnerablity... with Garrett Hedlund stealing the show (with an ambiguous sort of character, you can't figure what drives him, or where he wants to go, or even why -- ), with a charm that is irresistable, and a voice (even McGraw has said) is wondrous. And let's not forget Leighton Meester, who can sing, and developes into a real darling... yet still doesn't hold the bottom of the basket together.With what we have, weaknesses and all, I give it 4 1/2 stars.

In Country Strong the husband James is caregiver for country music star Kelly Canter (Paltrow). The married couple fell in love as children, have aged under the influence of her singing talent and his ambition, but without mature role modeling or guidance fromMarried People: Staying Together in the Age of Divorce. A year before the movie opens Kelly drove drunk in Dallas, lost their pregnancy in an auto accident and entered rehabilitation.The Caregiver Helpbook, Powerful Tools for CaregiversIn hospital instead of pausing to reflect whether talent is necessary and/or sufficient to happiness, Kelly careens toward a different distraction, an orderly who writes music, allowing infidelity to displace honest self appraisal. Yet when her husband finds relaxation and de-stressing laughter with a apparently uncomplicated young female singer, Kelly self-destructs.Kelly's self-absorbed mental illness perceives being hurt by others (guilt, blame, shame), yet ignores harm she rains down on others (broken trust, infidelity, emotional affair).Kelly has other talents: intuiting dishonesty in and mentoring the younger singer Chiles before departing.Like a one-way mirror Kelly sees others as hurting her; she does not see the pain her choices cause others.The circle of concern is wider than an individual and includes family. Genuine healing would involve her husband so both could learn about the broken brain of mental illness, possible treatments and reflect on each option's potential consequences before she was released from hospitalNational Geographic: Stress - Portrait of a Killer.Expensive band-aid rehab only dries Kelly out; it does not address choosing abstention from all distractions and the painful work of honest self-examination: long, hard, effortful, lifelong. Avoiding distractions is only the first step in self-discovery, self-parenting, growing beyond past failure.There are many kinds of caring: learning about another person and their needs, learning about our own needs, finding common ground ASIN:0143118757 Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In, learning from healthy mentors, relentlessly seeking options and advocating for measured challenge and supported changeTemple Grandin.Now, Voyager go thou forth to seek and find. Walt WhitmanCountry Strong says love is necessary but is not sufficient alone for happiness. Caring may be lust or asexual, opportunistic or supportive, manipulative or unselfish. The movie seems to say you can use your God given talents wisely or allow the talents to use you.InA Different Kind of Luxury: Japanese Lessons in Simple Living and Inner Abundance, Wakako Oe walks away from showing her paintings in Tokyo galleries to live in rural mountains carving traditional puppets; her sustenance is satisfaction, quiet, peace of mind. As Rago inRenaissance Mansays via Shakespeare: the choices we make dictate the life we lead. Same message from Rafe Esquith to the ASIN:B000CRR3GA The Hobart Shakespeareans andHealing & the Mind (Programs 1-5).I have a mentor who did what Kelly does in Country Strong. One day, without my asking, walked up and simply laid down a few rules: always buy more than one of any clothing. At lunch shower, change into the clean clothes. You will be fresh, ready to think, work in the afternoon. Use a rolling suitcase, saves wait time, you are certain to have your clothes when you need them (Travelpro Crew 8 22 Inch Rollaboard; this was shared years before rolling suitcases became popular) Don't drink ever, you need a clear head to make decisions. Alcohol makes you think you are way more clever than you actually are. Country Strong's message of mentoring: if you have a chance to teach someone something they don't even know they need, go ahead and offer it. Another mentor guided my reading, travels, role modeled risk taking and revealed the terrors of some choices and their consequences.Healthy mentors, for Kelly AA sponsors, can make a difference. Surrogate families (Temple Grandin's aunt, her mentor Carlock) advise more objectively, and even allow for the unconventional possibility (Temple's hugging machine, Lional Logue's invented therapy for stuttering in King's Speech) when biological family are too close, sharing the same genetic blindness, to grant a different perspective.Kelly recognizes that Chiles lies to herself and others about who she is, who her parents are. Kelly's acknowledgement of the younger woman's ambition, ego and dreams is her way of saying ""you are vulnerable, the stress of fame crushes some people, choose wisely."" It is an act of kindness, not an overture of friendship.Kelly uses herself up meeting the expectations of audiences; the energy drain doesn't leave anything for her to live on. Kelly's final mentoring gift to Chiles is to show the price you pay if you allow your talent to make the decisions ""that's how it's done"" before her final departure. Having a skill isn't imprisonment, Kelly did use her talent for the good eg with Travis the Make A Wish boy with leukemia. Impulsivity coexists with maturity, restraint, humility; we choose how to balance the contribution of each.Other movies about choosing caring within life's constraints:P.O.V.: What I Want My Words to Do to YouandDhamma Brothersself-examination, Broken Trail (Two-disc) being our best self, Departures choosing forgiveness, Now, Voyager (Keepcase), The King and I (50th Anniversary Edition), Shallow Hal choosing heart.Country Strong weaves a complicated story of brain brokenness, heart thumping adolescent hormone attraction, mature deliberate choices to self-nurture, coming of age and self-discovery . . . or not.Power of talent to be used for vanity or balance, to consume or heal.The world breaks everyone and afterward many are strong at the broken places. But those that will not break it kills. It kills the very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially. If you are none of these you can be sure it will kill you too but there will be no special hurry.

1364224,AVN00ASBFTMN6,B003UESJ9M,Smoking Ace,"[11, 23]","A couple of weeks before its opening, Shana Festa's Country Strong was gaining hype.  Gweneth Paltrow was making appearances on music awards shows left and right, and the film itself was being promoted as kind of a Country ""All about Eve"". Before viewing the film, I felt that this would be about the unbridled rivalry between an upcoming and fading star.  Now that I have seen Country Strong, I realize how unfitting that description is. Country Strong is not really a film about the dying and replacing of a star but rather the process (and self-pitying) that comes with ressurecting one. This could've been an interesting film about today's country music scene. But Alas we are stuck with a group of unlikable characters, a screenplay that is more interested in slogging through unneeded melodrama and back stage cliches, and a floundering mess of a film.If I could describe this film in one word it would be aimless. This film literally had absolutly no idea where it was going. The majority of this film is spent in  1 repititious cycle.1)Someone plays a song2)Kelly gets upset3)Kelly gets better4)Goes to different town5)Repeat!In between that we are given meaningless conversations, sparks between stars, and absolutly nothing insightful about life in the music business. I wasn't expecting Altman's ""Nashville"" but at least something a tad deeper then ""who's going to fall in love with who"" or ""will Kelly triumph in the end"". I will give this film credit for some good performances. The whole cast has singing talent, and some of these songs rise above CMT fare. My only problem with this is that the script doesn't do much to make us care about the singers behind the songs.We want to like Kelly, Beau, James, and Chiles But this script doesn't know how to take them beyond one demension. Even in Kelly's most heartbreaking states, I could not feel sorry for her because this film refused to show us a side of her that wasn't selfish or shallow. The film doesn't want to go into detail about her alcohol abuse or rehab troubles, only wanting to skip to the heartwrenching scenes where Beau has to the tear the bottle away from her.  All of the other characters try just as hard to win our hearts, except for Tim McGraw; who oddly reminds me of a supervillian here (his Kyle McLaughlin hairstyle says it all), But all of this comes to no avail.Throughout Country Strong I kept  hoping for interesting scenarios to happen, anything more interesting then this. Maybe James and Chiles could have an affair, or Beau could be pretending to swoon Kelly to raise his own stardom, or James ends up being a member of an evil conglomerate trying to hypnotize the world with country pop. Hell anything to break the long driven  road we've all been on before. Not to mention the meandering string of endless backstage scenes and trips to each cast member's hotel rooms. There are a few shining moments here: The Make a wish foundation scene and the 4 second train sequence, but they are only mere reminders of Country Strong's lost potential. It is not the film about fame it was probably meant to be, it is a film about a famous woman who can't do anything but pity herself and the people around her who can't do anything but pity her.That is what I received from this film anyways, many others will have different opinions. All I know is that this film didn't give me any new insights on fame or the country music scene. Instead it made me realize just how many times a storyline can be re-hashed before its dead. I will give it 2 stars for some good music, Beau's cover of ""Silver Wings"" was a hit for me. But overall the film was a misfire, and far from the Country ""All About Eve"" this film could've been. Trust me if there's anything this film needed, it was a few Eve Harringtons.Overall rating: 2/5Pros: Sub-Par Acting, Some good songs.Cons: Cliches, Bad script, predictable, unlikeable characters, overall forgettable",2,A Big Country Mess,1294790400,"01 12, 2011",2011,3923,"['couple', 'weeks', 'opening', 'Shana', 'Festa', 'Country', 'Strong', 'was', 'gaining', 'hype', 'Gweneth', 'Paltrow', 'was', 'making', 'appearances', 'music', 'awards', 'left', 'right', 'film', 'was', 'being', 'promoted', 'kind', 'Country', 'Eve', 'viewing', 'film', 'felt', 'would', 'be', 'unbridled', 'rivalry', 'upcoming', 'fading', 'star', 'Now', 'have', 'seen', 'Country', 'Strong', 'realize', 'how', 'unfitting', 'description', 'Country', 'Strong', 'not', 'really', 'film', 'dying', 'replacing', 'star', 'rather', 'process', 'self-pitying', 'ressurecting', 'one', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'interesting', 'film', 'today', 'country', 'music', 'scene', 'Alas', 'are', 'stuck', 'group', 'unlikable', 'characters', 'screenplay', 'more', 'interested', 'slogging', 'unneeded', 'melodrama', 'back', 'stage', 'cliches', 'floundering', 'mess', 'film.If', 'could', 'describe', 'film', 'one', 'word', 'would', 'be', 'aimless', 'film', 'literally', 'had', 'absolutly', 'no', 'idea', 'where', 'was', 'going', 'majority', 'film', 'spent', '1', 'repititious', 'cycle.1', 'Someone', 'song2', 'Kelly', 'upset3', 'Kelly', 'better4', 'different', 'town5', 'Repeat', 'are', 'given', 'meaningless', 'conversations', 'sparks', 'stars', 'absolutly', 'nothing', 'insightful', 'life', 'music', 'business', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'Altman', 'Nashville', 'least', 'something', 'tad', 'deeper', 'then', 'who', 'going', 'fall', 'love', 'who', 'will', 'Kelly', 'triumph', 'end', 'will', 'give', 'film', 'credit', 'good', 'performances', 'whole', 'cast', 'singing', 'talent', 'songs', 'rise', 'CMT', 'fare', 'only', 'problem', 'script', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'make', 'care', 'singers', 'songs.We', 'want', 'like', 'Kelly', 'Beau', 'James', 'Chiles', 'script', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'take', 'one', 'demension', 'Even', 'Kelly', 'most', 'heartbreaking', 'states', 'could', 'not', 'feel', 'sorry', 'film', 'refused', 'show', 'side', 'was', ""n't"", 'selfish', 'shallow', 'film', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'detail', 'alcohol', 'abuse', 'rehab', 'troubles', 'only', 'wanting', 'skip', 'heartwrenching', 'scenes', 'where', 'Beau', 'tear', 'bottle', 'away', 'other', 'characters', 'try', 'just', 'as', 'hard', 'win', 'hearts', 'Tim', 'McGraw', 'who', 'oddly', 'supervillian', 'here', 'Kyle', 'McLaughlin', 'hairstyle', 'avail.Throughout', 'Country', 'Strong', 'kept', 'hoping', 'interesting', 'scenarios', 'happen', 'anything', 'more', 'interesting', 'then', 'Maybe', 'James', 'Chiles', 'could', 'have', 'affair', 'Beau', 'could', 'be', 'pretending', 'swoon', 'Kelly', 'raise', 'own', 'stardom', 'James', 'up', 'being', 'member', 'evil', 'conglomerate', 'trying', 'hypnotize', 'world', 'country', 'pop', 'Hell', 'anything', 'break', 'long', 'driven', 'road', ""'ve"", 'been', 'before', 'Not', 'mention', 'meandering', 'string', 'endless', 'backstage', 'scenes', 'trips', 'cast', 'member', 'hotel', 'rooms', 'are', 'few', 'shining', 'moments', 'here', 'Make', 'wish', 'foundation', 'scene', '4', 'second', 'train', 'sequence', 'are', 'only', 'mere', 'reminders', 'Country', 'Strong', 'lost', 'potential', 'not', 'film', 'fame', 'was', 'probably', 'meant', 'be', 'film', 'famous', 'woman', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'pity', 'people', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'pity', 'her.That', 'what', 'received', 'film', 'many', 'others', 'will', 'have', 'different', 'opinions', 'know', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'new', 'insights', 'fame', 'country', 'music', 'scene', 'Instead', 'made', 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'storyline', 'can', 'be', 're-hashed', 'dead', 'will', 'give', '2', 'stars', 'good', 'music', 'Beau', 'cover', 'Silver', 'Wings', 'was', 'hit', 'overall', 'film', 'was', 'misfire', 'far', 'Country', 'Eve', 'film', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Trust', 'anything', 'film', 'needed', 'was', 'few', 'Eve', 'Harringtons.Overall', 'rating', '2/5Pros', 'Sub-Par', 'Acting', 'good', 'songs.Cons', 'Cliches', 'Bad', 'script', 'predictable', 'unlikeable', 'characters', 'overall', 'forgettable']",N/A

With the help of opening act Beau (Hedlund) she tries to get through.  Let me start off by saying...I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!  Easily the best movie about the music business since ""Walk The Line"" (yes, better then ""Crazy Heart"").  This movie focuses on three stars and thier rise and fall. Beau to me is what a young Bad Blake (from ""Crazy Heart"") would have been like.  Being a country music fan myself (not a Taylor Swift-pop country music fan), I loved the line Beau says after Chiles wants to make a pop-country album, ""Just because something's on the radio doesn't mean it's good.""  This is a movie that doesn't pull any punches about the music industry and what the singers go through, which helps it in the long run.  If you liked ""Crazy Heart"", you will love this movie.
