Emma Samms is good as the icy female lead whom Cheech charms into loosening up and Terence Cooper is in full Jason Robards-mode as her father. Some good gags, some not-so-good ones but it's not so bad that the director (Michael Gottlieb) needed to have the pseudonymous Alan Smithee take place of his own name.
