1222433,A2C5B3E96YWCFF,B001OD6H5O,Crystal F. Soto,"[0, 0]",this dvd is a great tool for any tribal fusion dancer.... i wouldnt recomend it for the beginner dancer. (It might frustrate you) but its definately aimed more towards the dancer who is already studying tribal fusion. Zoe Jakes is an amazing dancer!!!!! and so hilarious too....,5,awsome dancer!!!!,1247011200,"07 8, 2009",2009,278,"['dvd', 'great', 'tool', 'tribal', 'fusion', 'dancer', 'i', 'wouldnt', 'recomend', 'beginner', 'dancer', 'might', 'frustrate', 'definately', 'aimed', 'more', 'dancer', 'who', 'already', 'studying', 'tribal', 'fusion', 'Zoe', 'Jakes', 'amazing', 'dancer', 'so', 'hilarious', 'too']",Bellydance Superstars: Tribal Drum Solo Choreography with Zoe & Issam

One who truly can give you good measure to being a good musician. As for Zoe Jakes, her wild behavior speaks for itself to who she is! Despite her professional attitude and amazing talent, Zoe has humor that will leave you remebering her always! Not only is this instructional video very good, Zoe makes it hilarious and fun to watch. Making it hardly the boring dance instruction video you may have thought it was at first.

1222435,A340KVMHSQ9FG5,B001OD6H5O,Lauren Noelle Clarke,"[0, 0]","While Zoe Jakes is a beautiful dancer with a fun, likeable personality, this DVD is very hard to learn from!  The complicated choreography is broken down into sections based on the drum rhythm, but the sections are too large to learn without wearing out your rewind button--my remote literally died while watching this DVD!  She runs through the sections once or twice and then you are on your own--she doesn't even add them on to the previous sections.  My favorite part of this DVD was Issam describing the different rhythms and playing a couple samples--I took notes!--but even that required rewinding several times to get my &#34;dooms&#34; from my &#34;teks&#34;.  Even if you are a super-fast learner and an experienced dancer, this DVD is only slightly better than simply watching a Youtube video and figuring things out on your own.",2,Kills Your Remote With Constant Rewinding,1394668800,"03 13, 2014",2014,840,"['Zoe', 'Jakes', 'beautiful', 'dancer', 'fun', 'likeable', 'personality', 'DVD', 'very', 'hard', 'learn', 'complicated', 'choreography', 'broken', 'down', 'sections', 'based', 'drum', 'rhythm', 'sections', 'are', 'too', 'large', 'learn', 'wearing', 'out', 'rewind', 'button', 'remote', 'literally', 'died', 'watching', 'DVD', 'sections', 'once', 'twice', 'then', 'are', 'own', ""n't"", 'even', 'add', 'previous', 'sections', 'favorite', 'part', 'DVD', 'was', 'Issam', 'describing', 'different', 'rhythms', 'playing', 'couple', 'samples', 'took', 'notes', 'even', 'required', 'rewinding', 'several', 'times', 'get', '34', 'dooms', '34', '34', 'teks', '34', 'Even', 'are', 'super-fast', 'learner', 'experienced', 'dancer', 'DVD', 'only', 'slightly', 'better', 'simply', 'watching', 'Youtube', 'video', 'figuring', 'things', 'out', 'own']",Bellydance Superstars: Tribal Drum Solo Choreography with Zoe & Issam
1222436,A23IK1W2EH3LUT,B001OD6H5O,Ms. 2Step,"[8, 8]",This is a new approach to a drum solo. it is not a basic moves dvd nor a drills and memory dvd. This is not a lot of steps combined to equal one dance routine. It is intented to give you some new ideas from the traditional way to doing a drum solo. it is several individual combinations done to different drum beats. She decribe the beats to help you understand what to listen for.  It requires you to be a good listener and a good observationist because the way she explains the moves you don't get a chance to practice them a little at a time. She does not repeat the moves a lot either you will have to replay each part over if you did not get it. If you are looking for something different this will give you that. You would use this when you have learned the bascis and ready to start developing your own style and just practicing how to combine the moves to make a beautiful and unigue performance. I decided to keep it to learn some good travel and layering moves. Tribual of course is different.,4,new stuff to use,1239408000,"04 11, 2009",2009,1003,"['new', 'approach', 'drum', 'solo', 'not', 'basic', 'moves', 'dvd', 'drills', 'memory', 'dvd', 'not', 'lot', 'steps', 'combined', 'equal', 'one', 'dance', 'routine', 'intented', 'give', 'new', 'ideas', 'traditional', 'way', 'doing', 'drum', 'solo', 'several', 'individual', 'combinations', 'done', 'different', 'drum', 'beats', 'decribe', 'beats', 'help', 'understand', 'what', 'listen', 'be', 'good', 'listener', 'good', 'observationist', 'way', 'moves', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'chance', 'practice', 'little', 'time', 'not', 'repeat', 'moves', 'lot', 'will', 'have', 'replay', 'part', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'different', 'will', 'give', 'would', 'use', 'when', 'have', 'learned', 'bascis', 'ready', 'start', 'developing', 'own', 'style', 'just', 'practicing', 'how', 'combine', 'moves', 'make', 'beautiful', 'unigue', 'performance', 'decided', 'keep', 'learn', 'good', 'travel', 'layering', 'moves', 'Tribual', 'course', 'different']",Bellydance Superstars: Tribal Drum Solo Choreography with Zoe & Issam
