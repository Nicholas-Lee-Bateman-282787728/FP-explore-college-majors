286588,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,6301977513,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[4, 7]","For those interested in watching the film A Stranger is Watching (1982), hoping to find a faithful adaptation of Mary Higgins Clark's novel of the same name, you'd probably be better off skipping the film all together...for those interested in a fairly thrilling, suspenseful film with a modicum of the visceral, then this will fit the bill.  Adapted for the screen by Earl Mac Rauch (The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension) and Victor Miller (Friday the 13th, ""All My Children""), and directed by Sean S. Cunningham, whose previous feature had been the seminal slasher film Friday the 13th (1980), the movie features Kate Mulgrew (Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins, Throw Momma from the Train), Rip Torn (The Beastmaster, ""The Larry Sanders Show""), and Shawn von Schreiber in her one and only film role.  Also appearing is James Naughton from the Planet of the Apes television series, Barbara Baxley (Nashville), Stephen Joyce (Billy Bathgate), and character actor James Russo (Beverly Hills Cop, We're No Angels).  Also, in a `Hey!  I recognize that guy!' moment, keep an eye out for Vincent Spano (Over the Edge, Creator) in a bit part accredited as `Gas Thief'.The Peterson family suffered a terrible loss a few years earlier when Nina Peterson, wife and mother, was viciously brutalized and murdered in the Peterson home, right before the eyes of her daughter, Julie Peterson (von Schreiber).  The killer, Ronald Thompson (Russo), has since been captured and convicted, based almost solely on the eyewitness testimony of Julie, and now is on death row, awaiting his impending execution.  Julie and her father Steve Peterson (Naughton), a prestigious news magazine editor, have since tried to pick up the pieces of their life, but the upcoming execution has thrown them back into the spotlight as opponents of the death penalty, including Steve's television reporter girlfriend Sharon Martin (Mulgrew) desperately voice their condemnation of the severity of the punishment.  Turns out Thompson, who's proclaimed his innocence since his arrest, may truly not be the killer, as we see another stalking Julie, eventually kidnapping her and Sharon, locking them away in dirty, filthy, stinking hidey hole under New York's Grand Central Station.  Their abductor, Artie Taggart (Torn), is a mean, nasty, surly type whose motives are, at first, unclear, but his intent isn't, especially towards Sharon given how he despises them haughty types who think they're better than everyone else.  As the police try to piece together the clues, Sharon and Julie try desperately to escape, and Julie begins to realize that Artie Taggart, and not Ronald Thompson, was the one who killed her mother, and now an innocent man may soon die for her mistake.  There's little time to worry about this as Artie reveals his plans for both Sharon and Julie, ones that don't include going to Disneyland...First off, I have not read the Mary Higgins Clark novel this film is based on, but knowing the movie is based off a book I couldn't help feel there was quite a bit missing from the story.  I do know in the book the character of Julie was actually a little boy named Neil, and while that's probably the most obvious change, I doubt it's the most important.  I suspect the more important changes are within the structuring of the story, and where the emphasis was placed, comparatively speaking.  I'm sure in the novel relationships were more clearly developed and defined, ones that were most likely glossed over in the film.  The oddest aspect to me was getting the makers of the film Friday the 13th to bring the story to the screen.  They did a good job in making a watchable, interesting film, but in terms of staying true to source material, particularly the essence of the story, I couldn't help wonder how far they actually strayed.  Well, regardless, what's done is done, and I'll tell you what, I did enjoy the movie.  The direction was solid and the story did move along well.  The pacing was a little draggy in the beginning, but it picked up a little once the women were abducted.  There did seem to be some holes in the plot, but none really majorly gaping.  Cunningham took what could have been a predictable story and added a few twists here and there, maintaining my interest well.  The one aspect that seemed odd to me was why Torn's character didn't do away with Sharon right away rather than keep her along with the little girl.  He seemed to have some base interest in her, but she quickly proved herself more a liability to his plans than any meager pleasures he may have derived from her around for...his main interest was in the little girl, and the character of Sharon just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, which is why he took her along.  As far as the performances, I thought they were all pretty solid, especially Torn's as he seemed to exemplify the sleazy kind of character one would expect to do the things he did...he was mean, surly, reeked of attitude, and always ready with a colorful obscenity (sounds like a typical New Yorker).  One thing's for sure, his character sure got the beating a number of times in the film, so one can see from where some of his pent up hostilities stem.  As far as the characters of Sharon and Julie, I did appreciate how they weren't portrayed as typical, helpless victims cowering in fear, never attempting to free themselves of their imprisonment.  A good deal of the movie seemed to take place underneath the New York subway system, in dank, dirty, steamy, cobwebby, rat infested tunnels which was interesting in and of itself.  I think it is important to mention there are a couple of nasty sequences, one near the beginning (it's hammer time!), and another near the end, that do feature some visuals Cunningham apparently ported over from his previous film, Friday the 13th.  I guess he had a hard time leaving those slasher tendencies behind.  This didn't hurt the film, but it may be difficult for more sensitive viewers not accustomed to seeing such intimate violence depicted on the screen.The picture on this DVD, presented in widescreen anamorphic (1.85:1), looks relatively clean, and comes through well, and the Dolby Digital mono audio is very decent.  The only extra feature included is a theatrical trailer.Cookieman108By the way, I don't know if this holds true for the book, but in terms of this film, the title just didn't fit.
