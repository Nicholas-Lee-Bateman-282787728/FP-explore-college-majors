675179,A3W4GJR5CCADBX,B00005QFE5,"""50cent-haircut""","[3, 3]","This latest from Zhang Yimou is a gem. It doesn't carry a philosophical weight of his other offerings, but the emotional content and carry of the film is true and beautifully conveyed. Zhang Ziyi, the girl from Ang Lee's 'Crouching Tiger...' is perfectly cast as a stubborn girl who will not give away even an inch to get her love. She plays the part of the narrator's mother to perfection, with equal measure of sweetness, whimsy, and fiery temperament.The film starts with a man who returns to his backwards village to bury his father. His mother wants him and other people to bring the body back from the hospital on foot, carrying the coffin, so the deceased won't forget his way home. As the man contemplates this decision, he reminisces about the courtship of his mother and father.The movie is one of the most gorgeously shot films in recent years. You won't forget many of the scenes. The climactic sequence towards the end, when the mother runs toward the school, hearing her son, remembering her dead husband, is stirring and very moving. This is a work of a virtuoso filmmaker.",4,"A Simple Story of Love and Persistence, Beautifully Shot",1022544000,"05 28, 2002",2002,1088,"['latest', 'Zhang', 'Yimou', 'gem', ""n't"", 'carry', 'philosophical', 'weight', 'other', 'offerings', 'emotional', 'content', 'carry', 'film', 'true', 'beautifully', 'conveyed', 'Zhang', 'Ziyi', 'girl', 'Ang', 'Lee', ""'Crouching"", 'Tiger', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'stubborn', 'girl', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'even', 'inch', 'get', 'love', 'part', 'narrator', 'mother', 'perfection', 'equal', 'measure', 'sweetness', 'whimsy', 'fiery', 'temperament.The', 'film', 'man', 'who', 'backwards', 'village', 'bury', 'father', 'mother', 'other', 'people', 'bring', 'body', 'back', 'hospital', 'foot', 'carrying', 'coffin', 'deceased', 'wo', ""n't"", 'forget', 'way', 'home', 'man', 'decision', 'courtship', 'mother', 'father.The', 'movie', 'one', 'most', 'gorgeously', 'shot', 'films', 'recent', 'years', 'wo', ""n't"", 'forget', 'many', 'scenes', 'climactic', 'sequence', 'end', 'when', 'mother', 'school', 'hearing', 'son', 'remembering', 'dead', 'husband', 'stirring', 'very', 'moving', 'work', 'virtuoso', 'filmmaker']",The Road Home

We get a taste of beautiful fall countryside and winter snow; this cinematography is special.  What is ironic is that the parts of  the movie in present time are black and white, while the past is in vivid color. There isn't a lot of dialogue, and the subtitles are very easy to read.A man is summoned back home to North China because his father has died.  He listens carefully to follow the wishes of his mother whose devotion is to bury him in exact tradition.  She settles for nothing less.  There is a need to hire younger men to carry the body.  Determined, she wants his body carried through the journey on the road that was part of their love affair. It is so he ""won't forget his way home.""Then, in backflash, we learn the love story when a beautiful young girl, Di, who sets her eye on a schoolteacher who arrives from the city.  He helps build the school, the women each cook a dish for the workers, and she tries to get his attention by hopes that he picks her food on the lunch table.  Di follows him through the countryside as he walks the children home. She draws water from the well close to the school to get a glimpse of him.Then, abruptly, he is called away to the city for political questioning.  He promises to come home and it is two years that they have been apart.The Road Home is on Time magazine's 100 best films.

He meets with his Uncle and the Mayor, they inform him that his father died after becoming ill while out in a storm trying to raise money for a new school. He also learns that his mother insists that her husband be brought home by men walking down the road from the city to the village as was the old custom. Much of the movie then reverts to his narrating the story of how his parents met and fell in love before ending with the father's former students and others bringing him home, just as the old woman requested.This film was different in many ways for me. The present day scenes were Black & White while the flashback segment was in Color, the reverse of what I expected to see.The village had a primitive look like things hadn't changed much in centuries but the man's childhood home had a couple of movie posters for ""Titanic"" on the walls. I found the details of daily life very interesting, some of them I hadn't seen before.No sex, no violence (except for Zhang Ziyi taking an accidental tumble down a hillside), no kissing or any close affection but a lot of shy smiles.I probably learned of the movie because of some Amazon ""people who bought this also bought-"" recommendation, I don't remember. It has no action and often seems to move slowly but there are a lot of interesting details if you'll sit and wait for them.I thought Zhang Ziyi did a good job, this is I think the only film of hers in which she hasn't been in something with a lot of action, if you want action you don't want this movie.",3,"A different kind of romance, Zhang Ziyi does well in it.",1116374400,"05 18, 2005",2005,1632,"['movie', 'man', 'arriving', 'back', 'home', 'village', 'China', 'being', 'informed', 'death', 'father', 'Uncle', 'Mayor', 'inform', 'father', 'died', 'becoming', 'ill', 'out', 'storm', 'trying', 'raise', 'money', 'new', 'school', 'also', 'mother', 'husband', 'be', 'brought', 'home', 'men', 'walking', 'down', 'road', 'city', 'village', 'was', 'old', 'custom', 'Much', 'movie', 'then', 'narrating', 'story', 'how', 'parents', 'met', 'fell', 'love', 'ending', 'father', 'former', 'students', 'others', 'bringing', 'home', 'just', 'old', 'woman', 'requested.This', 'film', 'was', 'different', 'many', 'ways', 'present', 'day', 'scenes', 'were', 'Black', 'White', 'flashback', 'segment', 'was', 'Color', 'reverse', 'what', 'expected', 'see.The', 'village', 'had', 'primitive', 'look', 'things', 'had', ""n't"", 'changed', 'much', 'centuries', 'man', 'childhood', 'home', 'had', 'couple', 'movie', 'posters', 'Titanic', 'walls', 'found', 'details', 'daily', 'life', 'very', 'interesting', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before.No', 'sex', 'violence', 'Zhang', 'Ziyi', 'taking', 'accidental', 'tumble', 'down', 'hillside', 'kissing', 'close', 'affection', 'lot', 'shy', 'smiles.I', 'probably', 'learned', 'movie', 'Amazon', 'people', 'who', 'bought', 'also', 'bought-', 'recommendation', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'action', 'often', 'move', 'slowly', 'are', 'lot', 'interesting', 'details', ""'ll"", 'sit', 'wait', 'them.I', 'thought', 'Zhang', 'Ziyi', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'think', 'only', 'film', 'hers', ""n't"", 'been', 'something', 'lot', 'action', 'want', 'action', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'movie']",The Road Home
675182,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B00005QFE5,Alex Udvary,"[22, 22]","&quot;The Road Home&quot; is made by my favorite foreign director around today! I don't count Bergman because he just writes now. But  Zhang Yimou, the director of this film, always manages to put such beauty into his films. Probably best known for films like &quot;Not One Less&quot;, &quot;Shanghai Traid&quot;, &quot;Raise the Red Lantern&quot;, &amp; &quot;To Live&quot;. &quot;The Road Home&quot; follows in his tradition of making powerful, beautiful films.I've seen about 60 films this year, and I know that's not a lot when compared to how many critics see. But, I think it's a pretty large amount when compared to the amount that the average movie fan goes to see. From everything I've seen this year, nothing has been able to express the passion of this film! No film has been as tender, poignant, &amp; embarcive as this. I hate to admit this, for it's not really manly, but, I was misty by the end of the film. I've not seen a film that could do that to me in a long time.Many bash this film saying, there's no story. It doesn't move. There's no point to it. How wrong they are. Of course there's a story to the film. I was watching something all that time lol. It's a very innocent, simple story that captivates it's audience. A young man, Yusheng (Honglei Sun) goes back home after hearing about the death of his father. A local school teacher, who helped build the very same school where he worked. His mother is grief-stricken, understandablely. There's an old tradition that after one dies, one must be brought back to where they lived. Only they must be brought back by foot! Other's must carry the coffin so the person's soul will remember how to get back home. Yusheng mother, will not give in. She demands that the townspeople follow the old tradition. Afterwards, Yunsheng starts thinking about his mother and father, he sees a picture of them taken the day of their marriage. It makes him think about the story of how they met. And, this is where the film starts to take off. Granted, it sounds simple, but, please don't dismiss it. Just think of &quot;The Bicycle Thief&quot;. It takes a simple story, and does something with it, many films, no matter how complex their story-line may be can do. &quot;The Road Home&quot; is the same way. It may sound simple, but, give it a chance, trust me, you'll be impressed.I really, really love this movie. Everything about it seems to fall together in perfect pieces. The music by Bao San is charming. It hits all the romantic and dramatic spots it needed to. The script based on the book &quot;Remembrance&quot; written by Shi Bao, as is the script, is truly wonderful. It carries such heart with it. It makes us care about the characters so much. We can't help but get drawn into their lives. The film did more in 89 minutes then any Hollywood film I saw this year! I know, many people dislike having to read the sub-titles on these type of films, but, please, make an effort to see this one. I think this film will stay with me for a long,long time.p.s.- This film has already won and been nominated for many awards including; a Sundance Film Festival Award, a Bodil Awards, and a Berlin International Film Festival Award.",5,"As Of Now, The Best Film Of 2001!",1007510400,"12 5, 2001",2001,3190,"['quot', 'Road', 'Home', 'quot', 'made', 'favorite', 'foreign', 'director', 'today', 'do', ""n't"", 'count', 'Bergman', 'just', 'now', 'Zhang', 'Yimou', 'director', 'film', 'always', 'put', 'such', 'beauty', 'films', 'Probably', 'best', 'known', 'films', 'quot', 'Not', 'One', 'Less', 'quot', 'quot', 'Shanghai', 'Traid', 'quot', 'quot', 'Raise', 'Red', 'Lantern', 'quot', 'amp', 'quot', 'Live', 'quot', 'quot', 'Road', 'Home', 'quot', 'tradition', 'making', 'powerful', 'beautiful', 'films.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', '60', 'films', 'year', 'know', 'not', 'lot', 'when', 'compared', 'how', 'many', 'critics', 'see', 'think', 'pretty', 'large', 'amount', 'when', 'compared', 'amount', 'average', 'movie', 'fan', 'see', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', 'nothing', 'been', 'able', 'express', 'passion', 'film', 'film', 'been', 'tender', 'poignant', 'amp', 'hate', 'admit', 'not', 'really', 'manly', 'was', 'misty', 'end', 'film', ""'ve"", 'not', 'seen', 'film', 'could', 'do', 'long', 'time.Many', 'bash', 'film', 'saying', 'story', ""n't"", 'move', 'point', 'How', 'wrong', 'are', 'course', 'story', 'film', 'was', 'watching', 'something', 'time', 'lol', 'very', 'innocent', 'simple', 'story', 'audience', 'young', 'man', 'Yusheng', 'Honglei', 'Sun', 'back', 'home', 'hearing', 'death', 'father', 'local', 'school', 'teacher', 'who', 'helped', 'build', 'very', 'same', 'school', 'where', 'worked', 'mother', 'grief-stricken', 'understandablely', 'old', 'tradition', 'one', 'dies', 'one', 'must', 'be', 'brought', 'back', 'where', 'lived', 'Only', 'must', 'be', 'brought', 'back', 'foot', 'Other', 'must', 'carry', 'coffin', 'person', 'soul', 'will', 'remember', 'how', 'get', 'back', 'home', 'Yusheng', 'mother', 'will', 'not', 'give', 'townspeople', 'follow', 'old', 'tradition', 'Afterwards', 'Yunsheng', 'thinking', 'mother', 'father', 'picture', 'taken', 'day', 'marriage', 'think', 'story', 'how', 'met', 'where', 'film', 'take', 'off', 'Granted', 'simple', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'dismiss', 'Just', 'think', 'quot', 'Bicycle', 'Thief', 'quot', 'simple', 'story', 'something', 'many', 'films', 'matter', 'how', 'complex', 'story-line', 'may', 'be', 'can', 'do', 'quot', 'Road', 'Home', 'quot', 'same', 'way', 'may', 'sound', 'simple', 'give', 'chance', 'trust', ""'ll"", 'be', 'impressed.I', 'really', 'really', 'love', 'movie', 'Everything', 'fall', 'together', 'perfect', 'pieces', 'music', 'Bao', 'San', 'charming', 'romantic', 'dramatic', 'spots', 'needed', 'script', 'based', 'book', 'quot', 'Remembrance', 'quot', 'written', 'Shi', 'Bao', 'script', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'such', 'heart', 'care', 'characters', 'so', 'much', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'get', 'drawn', 'lives', 'film', 'did', 'more', '89', 'minutes', 'then', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'saw', 'year', 'know', 'many', 'people', 'dislike', 'having', 'read', 'sub-titles', 'type', 'films', 'please', 'make', 'effort', 'see', 'one', 'think', 'film', 'will', 'stay', 'long', 'long', 'time.p.s.-', 'film', 'already', 'won', 'been', 'nominated', 'many', 'awards', 'including', 'Sundance', 'Film', 'Festival', 'Award', 'Bodil', 'Awards', 'Berlin', 'International', 'Film', 'Festival', 'Award']",The Road Home

Well, if the girl is the lovely and expressive Zhang Ziyi the correct answer is quite a long time.Set in a quiet, rural village in a remote area of China director Yimou Zhang has translated a tender love story between Luo Changyu (Zheng Hao) a newly arrived school teacher and Zhao Yuelin (Zhang Ziyi), one of the local villagers, into a visual poem of young love in its purest, most innocent form.Focusing on Zhao as she goes about her daily tasks and routines we seem to experience first-hand her feelings and affection for the new teacher intensifying with each passing day. Every thought, every deed seems orchestrated in such a way as to bring her ever closer to her one true love.Zhang Ziyi is amazing! With an absolute minimal amount of dialogue she succeeds in conveying all her emotional yearnings and desires visually; through her eyes, delicate facial expressions and subtle body movements and gestures. She is truly a remarkable and gifted actress.The film starts out slowly, but stay with it.

675193,A256F7E787F5SG,B00005QFE5,Christopher Nieman,"[10, 10]","This is the nicest surprise I've had from a film in a long time. I am a follower of Zhang Yimou's work -- I've seen most of his films, even HERO, which inexplicably has yet to be released in U.S. theaters. THE ROAD HOME is a simple, rural love story built around the director's new muse, Zhang Ziyi (no relation). I guess I encountered this film with very low expectations. At first glance it clearly looks like a break from the director's signature character dramas, when in fact the differences are slight -- Zhang Yimou's storytelling, character development, and filmmaking style are still well in evidence. Instead of a departure in style, this film is a reminder of how the simple things in life are often the best.This is Zhang Ziyi's first film, but apparently it didn't warrant any domestic attention until she became an international star overnight with CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON. Better late than never, I suppose, because her performance here only adds to her growing reputation as one of the brightest young stars in world cinema today.It is also Zhang Yimou's gentlest, sweetest film and one that deserves to be ranked among his best. The black-and-white segments are shot documentary-style and allow the viewer to imagine the characters as real people reflecting on family history. In the middle of the film, every shot is lovingly framed with sweeping vistas and vibrant colors, and seeing it in anything short of widescreen cannot do it justice.Like all his films, THE ROAD HOME displays Zhang Yimou's uncanny ability to capture natural performances from his actors. In her romantic pursuit of a schoolmaster's attention, Zhang Ziyi shows us all manner of emotions, from innocent infatuation to desperate longing to quiet determination. Like her predecessor Gong Li, Zhang Ziyi is able to convey full feeling on camera without saying a word. It is a much more powerful and fulfilling performance than I expected. At all times we feel intimately involved with her quest -- particularly when the camera assumes her perspective, it's hard for the viewer not to feel closer to the story.I think this is one of Zhang Yimou's two or three finest films, and it's probably the most timeless story he has ever brought to the screen. I only wish the middle of the film had gone on longer, so we could share in this wonderful story even more. I also wish more directors and movie studios (especially in the West) could create &quot;small&quot; films and make them say as much as this.

But the beauty of the story lies in this simplicity.  There is no obvious pretense or ulterior motives that appear on screen.  It simply is what it is.  But there are so many feelings and messages contained within that they cannot be put into words.  It has to be seen and experienced to truly understand.  The dialogue and music are kept to an absolute minimum, the bulk of the &quot;action&quot; is conveyed through the subtle gestures of the main characters.  Most of the dialogue is voiceover, and even then only to explain context.  American audiences(and critics especially) might not be able to grasp everything that is going on in this film, and that is a shame, because I would think that this story could relate to anybody.  Maybe it is just too simple to hold a western audience's attention, or I don't even know what their problem might be.

Get it at Amazon.]This is not as opulently beautiful as some of Zhang Yimou's films but the story is compelling and wonderfully told with deep affection for the characters.  It's a love story beginning in the present with the death of a beloved village school teacher whose widow demands that he be honored by having his body carried--not driven--from where he died to his home in the small mountain village where he taught for over 40 years.  The expense seems extravagant and where will the pallbearers come from?  Most of the young people have left the village for the cities.Returning for the funeral is the dead teacher's son.  He realizes how important this ancient tradition of actually, physically carrying the body home, and so he goes about making that happen for his illiterate mother who is now all alone.The real focus of the movie however is the extraordinarily beautiful face of the then 19-year-old Zhang Ziyi (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon 2000; Memoirs of a Geisha 2005) who plays Zhao Di, the mother as a young woman.  We are flashed back to the teacher's arrival in the village and to the young Zhao Di doing everything in the exuberant way of first love that she can to catch his eye.  Again and again Zhang has his camera focused tightly on Zhang Ziyi's face as she experiences love at virtual first sight and goes through all the emotions of love's labors.  Pointedly Zhang Yimou shows only her face.  Her body is covered in the padded winter clothes of the Chinese north.In this focus on the skill, charisma and beauty of Zhang Ziyi one sees perhaps the influence of some Western directors like Ingmar Bergman, Krzysztof Kieslowski and Roget Vidam who made movies in homage to the beauty of their young stars, Bergman with Bibi Andersson and Liv Ullmann, Kieslowski with Juliette Binoche and Irene Jacob, and Vadim with Bridget Bardot and Jane Fonda.As always in the films of Zhang Yimou one sees in the background or off to a side a gentle but penetrating subtext on the effect that communism has had on Chinese society.

""The Road Home"" consists of a frame story, filmed in black and white, and an embedded story (a story within the story), filmed in vivid colour. It is a love story between an illiterate young woman and a village teacher, set in a superbly filmed background - it really makes you want to travel to China. It is a story of great love and rare devotion of a woman to a man. Though only a simple village girl, the heroine achieves her goal through sheer dedication and perseverance. Despite the straightforward plot line, the film is full of symbols, such as a food bowl, a hair pin, a grandmother who wept when her husband died until she became blind, and the road home itself. I found the many references to popular Chinese beliefs and superstitions fascinating, I've learnt a few things about Chinese culture, and I was left with a desire to explore more about it. The film also has a political dimension, not letting us forget that the love story is set in the years of the Cultural Revolution in China, and as a result we get a poignant reminder of how political issues can interefere with normal everyday life.The cinematography is superb - the fields, the heroine's clothes, the food, the bowl, are filmed in vibrant, eye-pleasing colours, and enchant the eye.This film is a gem, and I wholeheartedly recommend it!",5,A simple and beautiful story,1116547200,"05 20, 2005",2005,1353,"['simple', 'plot', 'well', 'rendered', 'Road', 'Home', 'frame', 'story', 'filmed', 'black', 'white', 'embedded', 'story', 'story', 'story', 'filmed', 'vivid', 'colour', 'love', 'story', 'illiterate', 'young', 'woman', 'village', 'teacher', 'set', 'superbly', 'filmed', 'really', 'want', 'travel', 'China', 'story', 'great', 'love', 'rare', 'devotion', 'woman', 'man', 'only', 'simple', 'village', 'girl', 'heroine', 'goal', 'sheer', 'dedication', 'perseverance', 'straightforward', 'plot', 'line', 'film', 'full', 'symbols', 'such', 'food', 'bowl', 'hair', 'pin', 'grandmother', 'who', 'wept', 'when', 'husband', 'died', 'became', 'blind', 'road', 'home', 'found', 'many', 'references', 'popular', 'Chinese', 'beliefs', 'superstitions', 'fascinating', ""'ve"", 'learnt', 'few', 'things', 'Chinese', 'culture', 'was', 'left', 'desire', 'explore', 'more', 'film', 'also', 'political', 'dimension', 'not', 'letting', 'forget', 'love', 'story', 'set', 'years', 'Cultural', 'Revolution', 'China', 'result', 'get', 'poignant', 'reminder', 'how', 'political', 'issues', 'can', 'interefere', 'normal', 'everyday', 'life.The', 'cinematography', 'superb', 'fields', 'heroine', 'clothes', 'food', 'bowl', 'are', 'filmed', 'vibrant', 'eye-pleasing', 'colours', 'enchant', 'eye.This', 'film', 'gem', 'wholeheartedly', 'recommend']",The Road Home

On the other hand, though, were others' reviews, so I couldn't quite put it out of mind.  Finally, after passing it over a half-dozen times or so, I decided -- still doubting and hesitant -- to buy it on the strength of Zhang Ziyi's acting in other films.  I'll not attempt to detail the ""plot,"" or incidents in it -- others have done that with varying degrees of accuracy.It is not a children's story.  (But will do no harm to children.)At the end of my first viewing I was speechless. Though a published writer, I could find no words to describe, or represent, or capture what it is, what it does.  I've since lost count of how many times I've watched it -- spellbound.  I've struggled to find the words with which to write adequate review; but as that has seemed impossible, only added comments to other reviews.  This is the best I've been able to do:Elementally human.Humane.Universal.Exquisitely gentle.Eventually I put it back into its case and onto the shelf.  But the very next day I had to put it back into the DVD player.  How can so moving a story be made of a few ordinary, inconsequential materialities? --An old chipped and stained -- but favorite -- bowl, both imbued with and vessel for an innocent, open, generous heart.A red jacket.A barrette.Mushroom dumplings.One road to and from a tiny village, which seems most often to run in only one direction: from.Made moving by means of some incomprehensible magic.The film itself, to the eye -- every frame a painting.  I don't know that I've ever seen another so perfectly realized, both perfectly balanced contrasts of crisp black-and-white, and splendid countless soft colors of autumn.The expert use of lines -- hills, trees, mountains . . .It is an extremely rare film which one forgets has a camera present.

675213,A20QK7TD80QM3Z,B00005QFE5,John H.,"[6, 6]","Another reviewer said:""This is the best Love Story (movie) ever created, bar none"", and I completely agree. I would say it's possibly oneof the best movies ever made. 99% of Hollywood movies are made for one reason, -money. A real filmmaker makes movies for the love and perfection of the art (not for commercialism), to tell a story that resonates with as many people as possible. If he or she can accomplish that feat, then the film will most likely be a commercial success.If there was ever a movie that made people feel compelled to write a review, this is it. They say a picture is worth a thousand words, but words can not do justice to this eloquent story. The scenery and cinematography alone are worth watching. If you have ever longed (in sadness) for a soul-mate or lost the love of your life, this story will touch your heart. I am a grown man, and it brought tears to my eyes several times.When I was watching this, I thought of my parents and myself being an only child. My parents are in their 70s and 80s. How will I be able to deal with their passing? Especially without a woman who loves me to comfort and console me and help me get through it. They are the only relatives I have. When I die, our family lineage dies with me. I so desperately want my mother to be able to hold her grandchild before she passes. I am 42 years old and my mother is 85, so time is not on my side. What if I never find love? It is so special and sacred when you do. These were some of the thoughts that were evoked when I watched this film. There are many parallels to the human condition other than (referencing) my own particular situation... And that's the beauty of this film, -that everyone who watches it will experience different emotions, relative to their own lives and experiences.""The Road Home"" is not a ""Chinese"" story. It is the story of all human beings. It transcends languages, cultures, and borders. It is the story of what we all want and need in life, -to feel whole, -to feel fulfilled, and to be loved. It is a story of true love, of pure love. It is a story about perseverance, commitment, and honor for the duration.I am in love with Zhang Ziyi, if for no other reason than the way she runs in this movie. They could make a moviewith just her running, and I would watch it. She is so cute, and that's what this movie portrays, innocence, -not innocence lost. This is filmmaking at its finest with no need for gratuitous sex, violence, corruption, lust, greed, foul language etc. Just perfect.

Many story tellers try to move their audience to reexamine what they thought they knew -- to leave them haunted and deeply touched.  Many attempts come off as rather silly and maudlin.  Not this film.  This film may touch you in a way you didn't think possible.I urge everyone to not try to discover too much about the specifics of this story -- I recommend you simply watch and let the story unfold.  Don't be overly curious about the plot -- anyway, this film is not &quot;about&quot; the plot, it's about being human.The plot of this film is not important in the same way a Rorshach ink blot is not important.  But, like the ink blot, this film will reveal something, possibly much, of what is inside the beholder.  This film is about something vital to the human experience, and that something is longing.It's about a longing to reconnect with a purity of feeling and experience.  A longing for simplicity in life, and the kind of love between a man and a woman that fulfills in such a way that is all but forgotten in the modern world, but if the instinct is alive inside you, this film will touch what is dormant, and will awaken it.Watching this film, you may have laid bare an essential quality of the human experience that before was likely untouched, and undiscovered.  To have this done is a deeply emotional experience; it is the meaning of the word &quot;epiphany.&quot;All this is accomplished with simplicity, subtlety, and absolutely, magnificently beautiful filming.  The crisp autumn air of northern China, the turning leaves, and the almost exclusive use of the low, late afternoon sun, coupled with backlighting and side-lighting creates a visual masterpiece, and contributes greatly to the emotional masterpiece.Watch this movie, and find out about yourself, if you dare.

675215,A1YJZRI42UPTKK,B00005QFE5,Johnny D,"[1, 2]","""The Road Home"" is the story of how one man's parents met and fell in love.  The story begins in the modern day as the son learns of his father's death.  He returns home to help his grieving mother and to take care of burying his father.  In the process of doing this, he tells the story of his mother and father falling in love.There is a lot about this film to like.  For one - its simplicity, it is the simple tale of how two people fell in love.  No intricate plots, heavy handed dialogue, thick symbolism requiring multiple commentary tracks for comprehension; just a boy and a girl falling in love to live a simple life happily ever after.The music is amazing.  Its use, along with some of the shots of the rolling hills and landscape, reminded me of ""Braveheart"" - which at its core is a love story as well.  The film is scored well to help heighten your emotional response to the characters and the story.I really liked the shift from the modern day being shot in B&W; and all the past being in color.  It is a nice way to show the emotional state of Di.  Her old age and now broken heart that Luo is dead.  Her love is gone.  Her son will never see his father again.  The world has lost its appeal to her and become a grey, lifeless place.  This contrasts nicely with her memories of youth and first meeting Luo.  I like they chose to shoot those scenes in the fall, when landscapes are at their most colorful.  It was also a good choice for her to always be seen in that bright red jacket, which always made her stand out both from the colors of the landscape around her and the other villagers - none of whom wore bright, bold colors like that.  They all wore basic earth tones and kind of fade into the scenery.  Even when she is young, when Luo is taken back to the city the season changes to winter and is able to take on the neutral, almost B&W; look of the modern day to represent her sadness.Overall, this is a really well-made, beautifully filmed and scored film with the most universal of all ideas, a nice, simple love story.",3,well-done love story,1351382400,"10 28, 2012",2012,2045,"['Road', 'Home', 'story', 'how', 'one', 'man', 'parents', 'met', 'fell', 'love', 'story', 'modern', 'day', 'son', 'father', 'death', 'home', 'help', 'grieving', 'mother', 'take', 'care', 'burying', 'father', 'process', 'doing', 'story', 'mother', 'father', 'falling', 'love.There', 'lot', 'film', 'like', 'one', 'simplicity', 'simple', 'tale', 'how', 'two', 'people', 'fell', 'love', 'intricate', 'plots', 'heavy', 'handed', 'dialogue', 'thick', 'symbolism', 'requiring', 'multiple', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'comprehension', 'just', 'boy', 'girl', 'falling', 'love', 'live', 'simple', 'life', 'happily', 'ever', 'after.The', 'music', 'amazing', 'use', 'shots', 'rolling', 'hills', 'landscape', 'reminded', 'Braveheart', 'core', 'love', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'scored', 'well', 'help', 'heighten', 'emotional', 'response', 'characters', 'story.I', 'really', 'liked', 'shift', 'modern', 'day', 'being', 'shot', 'B', 'W', 'past', 'being', 'color', 'nice', 'way', 'show', 'emotional', 'state', 'Di', 'old', 'age', 'now', 'broken', 'heart', 'Luo', 'dead', 'love', 'gone', 'son', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'father', 'again', 'world', 'lost', 'appeal', 'become', 'grey', 'lifeless', 'place', 'nicely', 'memories', 'youth', 'first', 'meeting', 'Luo', 'chose', 'shoot', 'scenes', 'fall', 'when', 'landscapes', 'are', 'most', 'colorful', 'was', 'also', 'good', 'choice', 'always', 'be', 'seen', 'bright', 'red', 'jacket', 'always', 'made', 'stand', 'out', 'colors', 'landscape', 'other', 'villagers', 'none', 'whom', 'wore', 'bright', 'bold', 'colors', 'wore', 'basic', 'earth', 'tones', 'kind', 'fade', 'scenery', 'Even', 'when', 'young', 'when', 'Luo', 'taken', 'back', 'city', 'season', 'changes', 'winter', 'able', 'take', 'neutral', 'almost', 'B', 'W', 'look', 'modern', 'day', 'represent', 'sadness.Overall', 'really', 'well-made', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'scored', 'film', 'most', 'universal', 'ideas', 'nice', 'simple', 'love', 'story']",The Road Home
675216,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B00005QFE5,Joseph Haschka,"[7, 8]","Occasionally, an American film will come along that pays tribute to the teaching profession. MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS (1994) was a terrific one that comes immediately to mind. THE ROAD HOME is a simple and poignant love story, as well as one about the honor accorded a teacher after long years of service. It comes from China, which perhaps has traditionally assigned teachers more social respect than here in the U.S.As the film opens, Luo Yusheng (Sun Honglei) is traveling back to his birthplace, a mountain village in northern China. (The scenery is perhaps reminiscent of the Rocky Mountain foothills on the eastern slope.) His father has died, and he's returning home to comfort his aged mother. On arrival, he learns that his father, who was the village schoolteacher for the previous forty years, expired in a nearby city. His mother, Zhao Di (Zhao Yuelin) insists that his body in its coffin be brought back in the traditional manner, i.e. hand carried by the local men, such that ""he will remember the road home"". She also has her son bring out of storage an ancient and decrepit loom, on which she weaves a covering for the coffin. As far as the plot is concerned, this activity serves as the takeoff point to the lengthy 1958 flashback, which tells the story of how the 18-year old Zhao Di (now played by Zhang Ziyi) fell in love with the handsome young teacher, Luo Changyu (Zheng Hao), who arrives in the village to help build the one-room school and begin classes. In that earlier time, Di, as the prettiest maiden in town, had been selected to weave the red banner to be attached as a good omen to the main roof crossbeam of the completed classroom.The young Di is the reason to watch THE ROAD HOME. Zhang Ziyi is utterly captivating as the uncomplicated village girl, who sets out to win the bachelor teacher's heart by cooking her best recipes. There's absolutely no hint of sex, violence or profanity, much less any special FX. It's the type of film that most Tinseltown producers probably wouldn't even consider making. It's sweet and gentle, and reminds the viewer of the bond that grows between husband and wife during decades of marriage, as well as the lasting influence a good teacher can have on students. Cynics and the maladjusted should stay away or risk Rolling Eyeballs Syndrome.I found myself liking this film a lot despite its sweetness and predictable plot.

When he returns home he finds out that his father's body is in a different city and his mother insists on having his fathers body carried home by hand according to old traditions.  This seems to be a very hard task, since it is winter and there are no other young people to help him in the village.  However, the mother's demand is easily understood, since he knows the story behind the passionate love she has for her late husband.

Road home won an important award in prestigious Berlin film festival.(how couldnt they vote ?) Movie starts with a young Chinese man returning his village in order to attend his father's ( teacher of the village)funeral. His mother asks him to bring his father on shoulders as in old traditions. Boy is confused at first but picture starts to become clearer as he learns the legendary love between his mother and father. His father a young and idealistic teacher comes to village to open a school. Mother, a sweet villager girl is atrracted to him from the first sight. Soon teacher becomes aware of her and a beautiful as well as an innocent love starts between them,refusing to crumble against all odds.Yimou shot the present time sequences in black and white,portraying cold winter and loss of a loved one better. However majority of the movie is shot in color. He bnrings loads of emotions and reality with his color choices.His portrayal of rural china is excellent. Summer and winter shots are beautifully executed and we witness a simple but joyful life out of the towns. Villagers' social life and values are all presented lightly in sequences like when villagers force teacher to leave heavy work for them or refuse to eat beside him because he is a town gentleman. Being a teacher and a doctor in rural areas in the east is still a very prestigious social status .A young Zhang Zi Yi performs brilliantly and the rest of the act is also superb.Her portrayal of the young and innocent villager girl is unforgettable. In this movie Zhang keeps everything pure and simple. Since it is a simple story and what else one could do to paint it with the camera? Vital point is to bring out the emotions which Zhang does it in an excellent way. Viewers emotions will dramatically change as film continues and you are advised to have some tissues ready with you for  some seqences. Film has many remarkable moments, like Zi yi's food preparation for the teacher and final bit when people attend the funeral and carry the coffin etc.This movie is a remarkable example of the spirit of the cinema and Yimou tells a story which is well written, well acted and superbly directed. A rain of emotions will wash you, and you will think that without blood,sex and worthless word salad as well as none sense rules such as dogma, a great movie can be done.In comparison to his remarkable past work,(in my personal opinion) so far Yimou really made his best movie with this one.In the world of cinema, sun is shining from the east these days.

675225,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B00005QFE5,Lee Armstrong,"[6, 6]","""The Road Home"" was a rewarding viewing experience.  Zhang Yimou whose ""Hero"" & ""House of Flying Daggers"" were action-packed tragedies does a masterful job with this more reflective romantic tale.  As is the hallmark of his work, the visuals are stunning from the use of the red jacket to the red hairpin.  Splitting the film into two sections, the present in black & white and the past in color, works as a way of telling two parts of the same story.  Sun Honglei does a nice job as the son who returns to take care of his mother.  As the aging mother, Zhao Yuelin has believable amounts of grief and stubbornness.  However, without a doubt, this is Zhang Ziyi's movie.  If ever there were a Chinese actress likely to garner an Oscar nomination, she'd be the one to watch over the next decade.  The nuances of her performance are phenomenal from the shy flirting glances with the schoolteacher to her panic as she runs with a bowl of dumplings.  This film won both the Silver Bear Award @ the Berlin film festival in 2000 & the Sundance World Cinema Award in 2001.

The schoolteacher is only 20 years old.  The girl is only 18.  We watch them fall in love, suffer a separation, and then come back to each other.

Fernandez ""Bookiewookie""","[7, 19]","I find it unsettling if not downright scary that almost all the reviews I have seen thus far in Amazon for this movie scream ""excellent"", for I find this as one of Zhang Yi Mou's less inspired and less riveting movies.  As I watched the first ten to fifteen minutes of the movie, I wanted to give myself the benefit of the doubt I was having, for there was nothing, other than the scene of a man going home to a remote village (which could be somewhere in Xinjiang), that I found as an indication that this WAS GOING to be another one of Zhang Yi Mou's cinematic jewels.Perhaps it was the plot, or perhaps it was an overblown focus on his young and very attractive actress, who clearly was a replacement for the unfortunately aging but always-the-arresting-persona that was Gong Li.  The camera did the younger actress plenty of justice, and I could sense that she and the director would have many more movies to come.  Hopefully, Zhang Yi Mou can recreate the same kind of arresting and captivating movies that he had made with Gong Li.But for this movie, it did not have many of the elements that wowed me when I saw ""Raise the Red Lantern"", ""To Live"", and ""Shanghai Triad"".  I consider ""To Live"" as a masterpiece, and whenever I watch it, even in my overworn VHS tape, I can always sense the vision and inspiration it took to create such a dramatic saga of many generations through sweeping socioeconomic and political changes in China (I am hoping for the day when the DVD of ""To Live"" comes out!).  I guess it would not be fair to use ""To Live"" as a golden standard against which ""The Road Home"",  a movie with a simple plot and minimal characters, can be compared.  I should check out ""Not One Less"", also by Zhang Yi Mou, since this movie is just as recent as ""The Road Home"", and the theme of teacher (albeit female) in a remote village is similar to ""The Road Home"".I give it, however, three stars, because of the outstanding photography.  The music was decent, although again, not as memorable, as the musical score in ""To Live"".For melodramatic Chinese movies, Chen Kaige's ""The King of Masks""  also sits on that much higher plane in my opinion.",3,Does this movie really deserve all these raves???,1049587200,"04 6, 2003",2003,2156,"['find', 'unsettling', 'not', 'downright', 'scary', 'almost', 'reviews', 'have', 'seen', 'thus', 'far', 'Amazon', 'movie', 'scream', 'excellent', 'find', 'one', 'Zhang', 'Yi', 'Mou', 'less', 'inspired', 'less', 'riveting', 'movies', 'watched', 'first', 'ten', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'movie', 'wanted', 'give', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'was', 'having', 'was', 'nothing', 'other', 'scene', 'man', 'going', 'home', 'remote', 'village', 'could', 'be', 'somewhere', 'Xinjiang', 'found', 'indication', 'WAS', 'GOING', 'be', 'one', 'Zhang', 'Yi', 'Mou', 'cinematic', 'jewels.Perhaps', 'was', 'plot', 'perhaps', 'was', 'overblown', 'focus', 'young', 'very', 'attractive', 'actress', 'who', 'clearly', 'was', 'replacement', 'unfortunately', 'aging', 'always-the-arresting-persona', 'was', 'Gong', 'Li', 'camera', 'did', 'younger', 'actress', 'plenty', 'justice', 'could', 'sense', 'director', 'would', 'have', 'many', 'more', 'movies', 'come', 'Hopefully', 'Zhang', 'Yi', 'Mou', 'can', 'recreate', 'same', 'kind', 'arresting', 'captivating', 'movies', 'had', 'made', 'Gong', 'Li.But', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'many', 'elements', 'wowed', 'when', 'saw', 'Raise', 'Red', 'Lantern', 'Live', 'Shanghai', 'Triad', 'consider', 'Live', 'masterpiece', 'whenever', 'watch', 'even', 'overworn', 'VHS', 'tape', 'can', 'always', 'sense', 'vision', 'inspiration', 'took', 'create', 'such', 'dramatic', 'saga', 'many', 'generations', 'sweeping', 'socioeconomic', 'political', 'changes', 'China', 'am', 'hoping', 'day', 'when', 'DVD', 'Live', 'out', 'guess', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'fair', 'use', 'Live', 'golden', 'standard', 'Road', 'Home', 'movie', 'simple', 'plot', 'minimal', 'characters', 'can', 'be', 'compared', 'should', 'check', 'out', 'Not', 'One', 'Less', 'also', 'Zhang', 'Yi', 'Mou', 'movie', 'just', 'as', 'recent', 'Road', 'Home', 'theme', 'teacher', 'female', 'remote', 'village', 'similar', 'Road', 'Home', '.I', 'give', 'however', 'three', 'stars', 'outstanding', 'photography', 'music', 'was', 'decent', 'again', 'not', 'memorable', 'musical', 'score', 'Live', '.For', 'melodramatic', 'Chinese', 'movies', 'Chen', 'Kaige', 'King', 'Masks', 'also', 'much', 'higher', 'plane', 'opinion']",The Road Home

When Di broke a bowl of dumplings she was taking to her loved one, grandmother had it fixed at great expense, even though it would have been cheaper to buy a new one, because THAT bowl was important to Di.Di learned from her grandma. When a funeral cloth had to be woven for her husband's procession, it was by now old Di who insisted that the only traditional loom in the village be fixed for the purpose.It is also an interesting film to understand the changes of China from the time of Maoist extremisms  and poverty in the 1950s to the relative freedom and much greater prosperity of the 1990s.

675231,A1PFT63CY1EF3M,B00005QFE5,Mark Walters,"[197, 202]","Eclipsing any romantic comedy or drama from Hollywood in the last 30 years, The Road Home achieves so much by doing very little.  Master filmmaker Zhang Yimou successfully captures what it's really like to fall in love for the first time through his use of cinematography (sumptuous as always), unparalleled attention to detail, and, as always, a super strong cast (spearheaded by relative newcomer, the beautiful Zhang Ziyi).  Unlike most romance movies, there is no love-making in this film.  There is no kissing.  The characters show their love through little things that we often take for granted:  preparing food, giving small yet meaningful gifts, and other gestures.  Like most of Zhang Yimou's films, there is relatively little music, however, the music that is there is perfect.  It rises to the occasion when needed and dies down when not.All of the elements of this film work together like clockwork...better than clockwork.  It manages to get its message across more than western romances through uncomparable use of setting and shot framing, costume and make-up, lighting (with some brilliantly-back lit shots of the actors), and figure behavior.Now about the DVD.  This is a film whose setting was meant to be seen only in widescreen.  The picture holds up well both in sun-lit outdoor conditions and slightly darker indoor scenes.

675232,AAW58LG72PG7I,B00005QFE5,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""","[2, 2]","There are movies of love and romance that are subtle reminders that the smallest of details may carry totemic significance. In THE ROAD HOME Director Zhang Yimou tells of a story that is so delicate in its nuances that the slightest of facial expressions or the merest whisper of singing is sufficient to carry a film that for a Westerner may seem glacially slow paced but for those who can appreciate the subtleties of shy love, the wait is not for action but for more nuance.  Zi Yi Zhang, who later went on to fame in CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON, is Di, an eighteen year old girl living in the smallest of rural communities somewhere in the vastness of China during Mao's Great Leap Forward of 1959. Her story is actually the middle part of the film.  The beginning and the end occur forty years later and relate the journey of Di's son, now an adult, who returns home to visit his mother only to learn that his father has died recently.  The older Di tells him that she is bound by custom to walk with her husband's coffin over many miles for a burial. Her son naturally objects that due to her age, the cost, and the brutal winter, such a trip is daunting.  During his visit, she tells him of her courtship by the newly arrived teacher, his future father, and it is his telling of the tale through his mother that forms the bulk of the movie.THE ROAD HOME seems a superficially simplistic tale of young love set amidst a rural life that is light years from the cultural chaos then afflicting China. Though this is a love story, the lovers never kiss, never even touch physically. What they do is look at each other.  Most of the camera is on her face.  We see numerous closeups of Di waiting and watching for him to return after he is called away for possible political interrogation in the big city.  He gives her a hair clip as a parting gift which she wears with all the proud equivalency of an engagement ring.  Di spends much of the movie either running after him as he is taken away from her or simply standing around waiting for him to return as he has promised. The film is replete with many cinematic symbols of delayed love.  The water well of the village contains the life giving liquid that will later unite the two.  A bowl is broken as she drops it while running after him.  A master pottery repairman unites the shards, foreshadowing a similar unification of the lovers.  The rural school house is first built, then falls into disrepair, then is repaired yet again.  Then there is the road of the title.  This road exists in both a literal and metaphorical sense.  It is eternal even if those who tread its cobblestones are not.  As the young Di runs up the road seeking her man in the middle part of the film, she as the older Di walks slowly with great dignity as she accompanies her husband's casket on what will be the last journey for both. Director Zhang shows a deft hand in showing the various transitions from past to present to past again.  While Zi Yi Zhang gets the lion's share of screen time, the actress who plays her as an elderly widow invests her role with a quiet dignity. THE ROAD HOME is a reminder that a life's journey need not be measured in the number of steps taken but rather in their quality.",5,Know the Present Know the Past,1267833600,"03 6, 2010",2010,3242,"['are', 'movies', 'love', 'romance', 'are', 'subtle', 'reminders', 'smallest', 'details', 'may', 'carry', 'totemic', 'significance', 'THE', 'ROAD', 'HOME', 'Director', 'Zhang', 'Yimou', 'tells', 'story', 'so', 'delicate', 'nuances', 'slightest', 'facial', 'expressions', 'merest', 'whisper', 'singing', 'sufficient', 'carry', 'film', 'Westerner', 'may', 'seem', 'glacially', 'slow', 'paced', 'who', 'can', 'appreciate', 'subtleties', 'shy', 'love', 'wait', 'not', 'action', 'more', 'nuance', 'Zi', 'Yi', 'Zhang', 'who', 'later', 'went', 'fame', 'CROUCHING', 'TIGER', 'HIDDEN', 'DRAGON', 'Di', 'eighteen', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'living', 'smallest', 'rural', 'communities', 'somewhere', 'vastness', 'China', 'Mao', 'Great', 'Leap', 'Forward', '1959', 'story', 'actually', 'middle', 'part', 'film', 'beginning', 'end', 'occur', 'forty', 'years', 'later', 'relate', 'journey', 'Di', 'son', 'now', 'adult', 'who', 'home', 'visit', 'mother', 'only', 'learn', 'father', 'died', 'recently', 'older', 'Di', 'bound', 'custom', 'walk', 'husband', 'coffin', 'many', 'miles', 'burial', 'son', 'naturally', 'due', 'age', 'cost', 'brutal', 'winter', 'trip', 'daunting', 'visit', 'courtship', 'newly', 'arrived', 'teacher', 'future', 'father', 'telling', 'tale', 'mother', 'bulk', 'movie.THE', 'ROAD', 'HOME', 'superficially', 'simplistic', 'tale', 'young', 'love', 'set', 'amidst', 'rural', 'life', 'light', 'years', 'cultural', 'chaos', 'then', 'afflicting', 'China', 'love', 'story', 'lovers', 'never', 'kiss', 'never', 'even', 'touch', 'physically', 'What', 'do', 'look', 'other', 'Most', 'camera', 'face', 'see', 'numerous', 'closeups', 'Di', 'waiting', 'watching', 'return', 'called', 'away', 'possible', 'political', 'interrogation', 'big', 'city', 'hair', 'clip', 'parting', 'gift', 'proud', 'equivalency', 'engagement', 'ring', 'Di', 'much', 'movie', 'running', 'taken', 'away', 'simply', 'standing', 'around', 'waiting', 'return', 'promised', 'film', 'replete', 'many', 'cinematic', 'symbols', 'delayed', 'love', 'water', 'well', 'village', 'life', 'giving', 'liquid', 'will', 'later', 'unite', 'two', 'bowl', 'broken', 'running', 'master', 'pottery', 'repairman', 'shards', 'foreshadowing', 'similar', 'unification', 'lovers', 'rural', 'school', 'house', 'first', 'built', 'then', 'disrepair', 'then', 'repaired', 'yet', 'again', 'Then', 'road', 'title', 'road', 'literal', 'metaphorical', 'sense', 'eternal', 'even', 'who', 'tread', 'cobblestones', 'are', 'not', 'young', 'Di', 'up', 'road', 'seeking', 'man', 'middle', 'part', 'film', 'older', 'Di', 'walks', 'slowly', 'great', 'dignity', 'husband', 'casket', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'last', 'journey', 'Director', 'Zhang', 'deft', 'hand', 'showing', 'various', 'transitions', 'past', 'present', 'past', 'again', 'Zi', 'Yi', 'Zhang', 'lion', 'share', 'screen', 'time', 'actress', 'who', 'elderly', 'widow', 'role', 'quiet', 'dignity', 'ROAD', 'HOME', 'reminder', 'life', 'journey', 'need', 'not', 'be', 'measured', 'number', 'steps', 'taken', 'rather', 'quality']",The Road Home

Zhang ZiYi was such a revelation in the movie.  It's not her script that made her stood out but her body language of an 18 years old that defied the local tradition of match-making but followed her heart to be with someone she truly loved.

The plot is so simple and I don't really care while I was watching it. The amazing cinematography, beautiful music, gorgeous Zhang Ziyi and her incredible performance grasped my attention. The story took place in a northern Chinese village during the time of the Culture Revolution. In this remote and poor village, most people and kids were illiterate. The villagers desperately needed a teacher to teach their kids. Therefore, when a teacher from a city finally came, he became the spotlight of the village. Everybody respected him or even worshipped him. The girl, Zhang Ziyi fell in love with him as soon as she first saw him. But since Chinese, especially a village girl were not used to expressing her feeling towards a man directly, she expressed them silently by making good dishes for him. The teacher knew it and loved her too. There was little conversation between the two lovers. There wasn't any physical contact between them either. But the viewer still feels the strong love between them. After the movie was over, the music, the beautiful winter scenery, and portrait of Zhang Ziyi stayed in my mind for a few days. It's the sweetest, yet saddest, movie I have seen in a long while.Zhang Ziyi is a young and talented actress. This is her first movie. I think she did a wonderful job. Most Chinese actors/actresses graduate from a formal film school. They are trained to be actors/actresses in a school. Therefore, most of them do ACT in a movie, look very phony with their false acting. But Ziyi is so natural in this movie.

A teacher wanting to give his knowledge to the next generation and a farm girl wanting to share her very soul with the man she loves. This is about how in the winter of a life, the summer is remembered and celebrated.From the very start of this movie, it will draw you into the intimacy of the most private thoughts of the characters. There are thoughts about life, death, love, loss and loneliness. The contrast of the black-and-white present with the ecstatic color flashback scenes of the past are so sharp, it is almost emotionally overwhelming. Snow drifts across the frozen earth and there are scenes of the bitter cold.The story is set around the life of a schoolhouse built when two people fall in love. As they age, the schoolhouse also ages and when businessman Luo Yusheng's (Sun Honglei) father dies, the schoolhouse is ready to be rebuilt. He leaves the city and returns to the snowy path leading to the mountain village of Sanhetun in Northern China.Luo Changyu (Zheng Hao) helped to build the schoolhouse and taught there for almost his entire life. After getting caught in a snow storm, his heart condition is revealed and he is unable to continue raising money for this project. He dies never seeing his dream of the new schoolhouse come true.Luo Yusheng finds his mother Zhao Di (Zhao Yuelin plays the older Di) weeping at the school. She finally tells her son of her plans to carry her husband back in a coffin on foot. She doesn't want to use a car and so he must employ people from the surrounding villages. As her son takes care of the details, she weaves a funeral cloth for the casket. We are reminded later of why this means so much to her as we think of her innocent face peering through the red threads used to create the cloth hung in the schoolhouse.The story of the romance between 18-year-old Zhao Di (Zhang Ziyi from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon plays the young Di) and Luo Changyu is the focus of the movie. They are perhaps in love from the moment their eyes meet. In a world of arranged marriages, this freedom to love is unique. Di has her heart set on Luo from the minute she sees him. She pursues him like an shy animal hunting in the forest. She views him from afar and slowly works her way into his heart. Her pink coat floating between golden leaves as she runs, her anxious heart captured by her gaze.Each day as the school is built, she brings a dish for him and hopes that he will taste something she has cooked for him. Then as he teaches, she can't resist the sound of his voice. She has to be near him.When he has to leave to be questioned for political reasons, she has just made mushroom dumplings and so wants him to taste them. While the story is simple, the emotions are complex. You know what the characters are thinking even before they have spoken. You feel their hearts, imagine it is your breath seeping into the cold air like steam or your hands making the mushroom dumplings.Your heart runs with her to find Luo. And then you cry when the bowl breaks because you feel the intense longing Di feels. You live this story with her, you see love through her eyes, you know she would walk barefoot in the snow if she could just find Luo.As she waits for Luo to return, we know she is completely in love. She tells him she will wait for him and he promises to return on the 27th. When he fails to return, Di feels she has lost everything unless she goes to find the man she loves.You will want to cry because this movie is so incredibly beautiful. It is beautiful in its simplicity. Director Zhang Yimou has made one of the most beautiful movies you will ever see. The music by Bao San fills any space you would possible have to draw a breath and escape from being absolutely captured by every scene.I will gladly read subtitles for a movie this exquisite. This is perhaps the only perfect movie ever made. If you only saw one movie in your life, this should be it. I feel I can hardly describe this movie to you. There are hardly words to tell you how this movie absolutely enchanted me. 100 stars would not be enough.Like fresh water drawn from the depths of a well, this movie is all consuming in how it refreshes your spirit. It is a drink from the clearest mountain stream. It is pure in its deepest emotions of hope and longing and rich beyond material possessions in the beauty of love.This movie sets your senses on fire. You hear the crispest of sounds, the ""splosh"" of water as it is poured back into the well, fresh snow crunching underfoot and the sizzle of food in a wok set over a fire. Your vision is in complete bliss as an aesthetic awareness of nature swirls around you in pictures and sounds in a rural Chinese setting.Completely Charming in every way.~The Rebecca Review",5,I Will

675242,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00005QFE5,Reviewer,"[14, 14]","...Without question, at the heart of the film is a monumental yet simple story of true love in the purest sense, and of the devotion which renders that love eternal.  But the film transcends even that, and within the greater context indicates the impact of the past upon the present, which is summed up in a single line from the film:  ""Know the past, know the present.""  And know, too, that the love portrayed in this story is the kind of love that is abiding, and that which sustains all that makes life worth living.  It's a veritable journey of the soul; one that will touch you deeply and linger in your memory long after the screen has gone dark.Upon receiving the news that his father has died, Luo Yusheng (Honglei Sun) leaves the city to return to his home, a small village in the mountains, to bury his father and comfort his bereaved mother, Zhao Di (Yulian Zhao).  When he arrives, however, he discovers that his mother will not be consoled until her wish concerning the burial of her husband, Luo Changyu (Hao Zheng) is fulfilled.  In keeping with a long standing tradition and superstition, Di insists that his coffin be carried by hand by the men of the village along the road connecting the village and the city, insuring by so doing that in death Changyu will always be able to remember his way home.Yusheng quickly finds that realizing his mother's request will be no easy task; their village is small and all of the able-bodied men have left for the city, leaving only children and those too old for such an arduous undertaking.  And it is winter, a harsh time of year in the mountains.  But Di is adamant, and so Yusheng sets about the business of fulfilling her request.  And as he does so, he reflects upon the story of his parents; a story well known throughout the village, for theirs was a love that was unbridled and boundless, the likes of which no one in the village had ever know before.  Or since.This film, so wonderfully crafted and delivered by director Zhang, is altogether ethereal and transporting; he tells the story in simplistic terms, and yet it is in that very simplicity that he finds the genuine honesty and truth that provides such an emotional impact and makes this love story one that rivals any the screen has ever known.  Aided by the masterful cinematography of Yong Hou, Zhang achieves that same sense of transcendence that defines much of Akira Kurosawa's films, such as ""Ran"" and ""Akira Kurosawa's Dreams,"" or Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.""  There is not a superfluous moment in the entire film, and Zhang proves that capturing pure emotion with the camera can express more than pages of dialogue recited by an actor.  And with his lens, Zhang opens up the very heart of the film and lays it bare for all to see and feel, finding more in the eyes of his characters and in their expressions than words could ever convey.  It's a study of human nature that is disarming in it's candor, and quite simply a brilliant piece of filmmaking by a director with an irrefutably incisive understanding of the human condition.Without question, though, the single aspect that makes this such an unforgettable film is the performance (in her motion picture debut) by Ziyi Zhang as the young Zhao Di.  A young woman of exquisite beauty, she has a sublime screen presence that is a portrait of the angelic, and her innate ability to silently express the myriad emotions called for by her character is used to great effect by director Zhang.  Ziyi's portrayal is one of youthful innocence mixed with stubborn determination, which gives her character the necessary depth to be entirely convincing, and she will win you over in a heartbeat.  She is so affecting that near the end, when Di, now an old woman, is hurrying across a rickety foot bridge, the same bridge we've seen the young Di traverse many times on her way to and from the schoolhouse (which is central to the story), despite the weathered age so evident on her face, because of the lasting impression made by Ziyi, you realize that she still bears the heart of the young woman you've come to care so much about by this time, and you understand that age is superficial; that this is a shell housing the spirit and the true beauty that resides within.  It's a beautiful moment to behold, and ours forever, due to the extraordinary performance and presence of the delicate Ziyi Zhang, as well as the tremendous sensitivity and care with which she is presented by director Zhang.The supporting cast includes Bin Li (Grandmother), Guifa Chang (Old Mayor), Wencheng Sung (Mayor) and Zhongxi Zhang (Crockery Repairman).  A love story told sincerely from the heart is a treasure that endures forever, like a painting by Monet or Renoir; and like those artists, director Zhang is nothing less than an impressionist behind the camera, capturing the distinctive rhythms of life and love for all time in ""The Road Home,"" a gentle, poetic film that will make it's way into the hearts of all who experience it.  And therein remain, forevermore.",5,"A Beautiful, Unforgettable Film",1034812800,"10 17, 2002",2002,5040,"['question', 'heart', 'film', 'monumental', 'yet', 'simple', 'story', 'true', 'love', 'purest', 'sense', 'devotion', 'love', 'eternal', 'film', 'transcends', 'even', 'greater', 'context', 'impact', 'past', 'present', 'summed', 'up', 'single', 'line', 'film', 'Know', 'past', 'know', 'present', 'know', 'too', 'love', 'portrayed', 'story', 'kind', 'love', 'abiding', 'life', 'worth', 'living', 'veritable', 'journey', 'soul', 'one', 'will', 'touch', 'deeply', 'linger', 'memory', 'long', 'screen', 'gone', 'dark.Upon', 'receiving', 'news', 'father', 'died', 'Luo', 'Yusheng', 'Honglei', 'Sun', 'city', 'return', 'home', 'small', 'village', 'mountains', 'bury', 'father', 'comfort', 'bereaved', 'mother', 'Zhao', 'Di', 'Yulian', 'Zhao', 'When', 'however', 'mother', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'consoled', 'wish', 'concerning', 'burial', 'husband', 'Luo', 'Changyu', 'Hao', 'Zheng', 'fulfilled', 'keeping', 'long', 'standing', 'tradition', 'superstition', 'Di', 'coffin', 'be', 'carried', 'hand', 'men', 'village', 'road', 'connecting', 'village', 'city', 'insuring', 'doing', 'death', 'Changyu', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'able', 'remember', 'way', 'home.Yusheng', 'quickly', 'realizing', 'mother', 'request', 'will', 'be', 'easy', 'task', 'village', 'small', 'able-bodied', 'men', 'have', 'left', 'city', 'leaving', 'only', 'children', 'too', 'old', 'such', 'arduous', 'undertaking', 'winter', 'harsh', 'time', 'year', 'mountains', 'Di', 'adamant', 'so', 'Yusheng', 'sets', 'business', 'fulfilling', 'request', 'so', 'story', 'parents', 'story', 'well', 'known', 'village', 'theirs', 'was', 'love', 'was', 'unbridled', 'boundless', 'likes', 'one', 'village', 'had', 'ever', 'know', 'before', 'since.This', 'film', 'so', 'wonderfully', 'crafted', 'delivered', 'director', 'Zhang', 'altogether', 'ethereal', 'transporting', 'story', 'simplistic', 'terms', 'yet', 'very', 'simplicity', 'genuine', 'honesty', 'truth', 'emotional', 'impact', 'love', 'story', 'one', 'screen', 'ever', 'known', 'Aided', 'masterful', 'cinematography', 'Yong', 'Hou', 'Zhang', 'same', 'sense', 'transcendence', 'much', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'films', 'such', 'Ran', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'Dreams', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'not', 'superfluous', 'moment', 'entire', 'film', 'Zhang', 'capturing', 'pure', 'emotion', 'camera', 'can', 'express', 'more', 'pages', 'dialogue', 'recited', 'actor', 'lens', 'Zhang', 'up', 'very', 'heart', 'film', 'bare', 'see', 'feel', 'finding', 'more', 'eyes', 'characters', 'expressions', 'words', 'could', 'ever', 'convey', 'study', 'human', 'nature', 'disarming', 'candor', 'quite', 'simply', 'brilliant', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'director', 'irrefutably', 'incisive', 'understanding', 'human', 'condition.Without', 'question', 'single', 'aspect', 'such', 'unforgettable', 'film', 'performance', 'motion', 'picture', 'debut', 'Ziyi', 'Zhang', 'young', 'Zhao', 'Di', 'A', 'young', 'woman', 'exquisite', 'beauty', 'sublime', 'screen', 'presence', 'portrait', 'angelic', 'innate', 'ability', 'silently', 'express', 'myriad', 'emotions', 'called', 'character', 'used', 'great', 'effect', 'director', 'Zhang', 'Ziyi', 'portrayal', 'one', 'youthful', 'innocence', 'mixed', 'stubborn', 'determination', 'character', 'necessary', 'depth', 'be', 'entirely', 'convincing', 'will', 'win', 'over', 'heartbeat', 'so', 'affecting', 'end', 'when', 'Di', 'now', 'old', 'woman', 'hurrying', 'rickety', 'foot', 'bridge', 'same', 'bridge', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'young', 'Di', 'traverse', 'many', 'times', 'way', 'schoolhouse', 'central', 'story', 'weathered', 'age', 'so', 'evident', 'face', 'lasting', 'impression', 'made', 'Ziyi', 'realize', 'still', 'heart', 'young', 'woman', ""'ve"", 'come', 'care', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'understand', 'age', 'superficial', 'shell', 'housing', 'spirit', 'true', 'beauty', 'beautiful', 'moment', 'behold', 'forever', 'due', 'extraordinary', 'performance', 'presence', 'delicate', 'Ziyi', 'Zhang', 'as', 'well', 'tremendous', 'sensitivity', 'care', 'presented', 'director', 'Zhang.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Bin', 'Li', 'Grandmother', 'Guifa', 'Chang', 'Old', 'Mayor', 'Wencheng', 'Sung', 'Mayor', 'Zhongxi', 'Zhang', 'Crockery', 'Repairman', 'love', 'story', 'told', 'sincerely', 'heart', 'treasure', 'forever', 'painting', 'Monet', 'Renoir', 'artists', 'director', 'Zhang', 'nothing', 'less', 'impressionist', 'camera', 'capturing', 'distinctive', 'rhythms', 'life', 'love', 'time', 'Road', 'Home', 'gentle', 'poetic', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'way', 'hearts', 'who', 'experience', 'therein', 'remain', 'forevermore']",The Road Home

More recently, one late night I came accross ""The Road Home"" in cable and fell in love all over again with Zhang's particular way of telling stories. I guess perhaps what defines Mr. Zhang's powerful cinematic discourse is the irresistible simplicity of it, and the  marvelous way he portrays the complex canvas of his chinese heritage by way of simple characters, ancient traditions and the overwhelming subtlety of a millenary culture. ""The Road Home"" is a moving story involving a son, a deceased father, and an aging grieving mother with what seems to be, a futile posthumous wish to honor the memory of her late husband. Mr. Zhang's slowly reveals feelings and emotional connections among all the characters and the very essence of life, tradition and family that has brought them to their present situation flourishes.

Comparing her usual roles as a tough sword fighter such as in ""Hidden Draggon Crouching Tiger"" or ""House of Flying Daggers"", I think this kind of movie suits a lot better for Zhang ZiYi. Speaking from Asian point of view, she is not the prettiest girl you can find in Asia but she definitely has the quality of sweetness and confidence in her look, which fits perfectly with the role in this movie.The story is indeed a celebration of great and undying love between lovers. What gives a greater impact on this movie is the way the story is set in a backward Chinese village where grand love is least expected to be found. The kind of simple yet passionate love between the two lovers in the movie has almost become extinct in reality.This kind of movie is very refreshing to the audience because it does not follow the typicality of most American movies where stories start off happily and end happinly.I strongly recommend this movie!",5,"""Road Home"" - What a great movie!",1103155200,"12 16, 2004",2004,1008,"['am', 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'Zhang', 'ZiYi', 'however', 'did', 'Road', 'Home', 'lot', 'Comparing', 'usual', 'roles', 'tough', 'sword', 'fighter', 'such', 'Hidden', 'Draggon', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'House', 'Flying', 'Daggers', 'think', 'kind', 'movie', 'suits', 'lot', 'better', 'Zhang', 'ZiYi', 'Speaking', 'Asian', 'point', 'view', 'not', 'prettiest', 'girl', 'can', 'find', 'Asia', 'definitely', 'quality', 'sweetness', 'confidence', 'look', 'perfectly', 'role', 'movie.The', 'story', 'indeed', 'celebration', 'great', 'undying', 'love', 'lovers', 'What', 'greater', 'impact', 'movie', 'way', 'story', 'set', 'backward', 'Chinese', 'village', 'where', 'grand', 'love', 'least', 'expected', 'be', 'found', 'kind', 'simple', 'yet', 'passionate', 'love', 'two', 'lovers', 'movie', 'almost', 'become', 'extinct', 'reality.This', 'kind', 'movie', 'very', 'refreshing', 'audience', 'not', 'follow', 'typicality', 'most', 'American', 'movies', 'where', 'stories', 'start', 'happily', 'end', 'happinly.I', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'movie']",The Road Home

I am not necessarily stating that one is better than the other, but you often find that many complex love stories just don't completely work.  The Road Home is a beautiful, simple love story that is as simple as the time and location in which it takes place, and the pieces fit together like a simple jigsaw puzzle.The son of Zhao Di has come home to the village where is mother is from.  He learns that his father has passed away.  While the son grew up in the village, he has spent much of his adult life in the city.  He has come home to be with his mother and to help her makes plans for his father's burial.  His mother insists that his father be walked from the city hospital back to the village.  Understand that this is no easy task since the village is good distance from the city.  Her son tries to talk her out of it, but she is adament.  And it is in the re-telling of how Zhao Di met her husband that convinces both the son and audience to understand why she wants to walk her husband back to the village.The film takes off from here as the talented Zhang Ziyi portrays the young Zhao Di.  She is an eighteen year-old girl living with her blind mother.  She is a beautiful young woman with many suitors wishing for her hand in marriage.  She has turned them all down.  We don't know why except that we can guess that she hasn't found what she's looking for in a husband.  Enter Luo, the new school teacher who has come to the village after living in the city.  Zhao Di is immediately captivated upon first seeing him.The sweetness in this film is in the simplicity of the village and the time.  Water must be fetched from nearby wells.  Looms are used to make clothing and cloths.  And even the ""courtship"" that is done more by Zhao Di than by Luo is sweetly simple.  She uses her culinary talents to make the best dishes with the hope that Luo will eat from her dish.  She waits by the road for one glimpse of Luo.  She walks to the well that is near the school for the chance that she might see or hear Luo.People often make the mistake that the more primitive a technological country, the more unhappy the people must be.  And yet,Zhao Di is not an unhappy girl.  She is an excellent cook, and she enjoys looking after her mother.  You get the sense that she does this not out of a sense of duty, but because she wants to.  Zhao Di never lives anywhere else but in the village.  The village is where she is happy.Zhang Ziyi is simply brilliant is capturing the sweetness and determination of Zhao Di.  She portrays Zhao Di with a fierce persistence to win the heart of Luo at any cost.  You will see several scenes in which she demonstrates this.I must mention the cinematography.  The locations and colors that are captured reveal an almost magical world with golden leaves on the birch trees and snow-swept hills of winter.Director Yimou Zhang does a great job of incorporating the technology of the time period.  In many ways, I was as captivated by the use of the loom, the sweatbox used for cooking dumplings, and the walk to the well as I was of the sweet love story.  I like his use of black and white in the future, and then the use of color for the past.  Most directors would do it the other way around.  And yet the color used for the past seems to show that it is revealing a happier time when young Zhao Di was in the fullness of her life, and the black and white showing how life is swiftly coming to an inevitable close for her after the loss of her one true love.The Road Home will capture your heart with its story and your eyes with its images.  Many saints, masters, and philosophers over the course of the centuries have stated that love is actually very simple; it is we who make it complex.  This beautiful film seems to truly capture that idea.",5,"Wonderfully Sweet, Simple Love Story That Captures the Heart",1187827200,"08 23, 2007",2007,3935,"['complex', 'love', 'stories', 'come', 'Hollywood', 'days', 'sometimes', 'enjoy', 'refreshing', 'feeling', 'love', 'story', 'simple', 'am', 'not', 'necessarily', 'stating', 'one', 'better', 'other', 'often', 'find', 'many', 'complex', 'love', 'stories', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'completely', 'work', 'Road', 'Home', 'beautiful', 'simple', 'love', 'story', 'as', 'simple', 'time', 'location', 'place', 'pieces', 'fit', 'together', 'simple', 'jigsaw', 'puzzle.The', 'son', 'Zhao', 'Di', 'come', 'home', 'village', 'where', 'mother', 'father', 'passed', 'away', 'son', 'grew', 'up', 'village', 'spent', 'much', 'adult', 'life', 'city', 'come', 'home', 'be', 'mother', 'help', 'plans', 'father', 'burial', 'mother', 'father', 'be', 'walked', 'city', 'hospital', 'back', 'village', 'Understand', 'easy', 'task', 'village', 'good', 'distance', 'city', 'son', 'talk', 'adament', 're-telling', 'how', 'Zhao', 'Di', 'met', 'husband', 'son', 'audience', 'understand', 'why', 'walk', 'husband', 'back', 'village.The', 'film', 'here', 'talented', 'Zhang', 'Ziyi', 'young', 'Zhao', 'Di', 'eighteen', 'year-old', 'girl', 'living', 'blind', 'mother', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'many', 'suitors', 'wishing', 'hand', 'marriage', 'turned', 'down', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'can', 'guess', ""n't"", 'found', 'what', 'looking', 'husband', 'Enter', 'Luo', 'new', 'school', 'teacher', 'who', 'come', 'village', 'living', 'city', 'Zhao', 'Di', 'immediately', 'captivated', 'first', 'seeing', 'him.The', 'sweetness', 'film', 'simplicity', 'village', 'time', 'Water', 'must', 'be', 'fetched', 'nearby', 'wells', 'Looms', 'are', 'used', 'make', 'clothing', 'cloths', 'even', 'courtship', 'done', 'more', 'Zhao', 'Di', 'Luo', 'sweetly', 'simple', 'culinary', 'talents', 'make', 'best', 'dishes', 'hope', 'Luo', 'will', 'eat', 'dish', 'road', 'one', 'glimpse', 'Luo', 'well', 'school', 'chance', 'might', 'see', 'hear', 'Luo.People', 'often', 'make', 'mistake', 'more', 'primitive', 'technological', 'country', 'more', 'unhappy', 'people', 'must', 'be', 'yet', 'Zhao', 'Di', 'not', 'unhappy', 'girl', 'excellent', 'cook', 'looking', 'mother', 'get', 'sense', 'not', 'sense', 'duty', 'Zhao', 'Di', 'never', 'anywhere', 'else', 'village', 'village', 'where', 'happy.Zhang', 'Ziyi', 'simply', 'brilliant', 'capturing', 'sweetness', 'determination', 'Zhao', 'Di', 'Zhao', 'Di', 'fierce', 'persistence', 'win', 'heart', 'Luo', 'cost', 'will', 'see', 'several', 'scenes', 'this.I', 'must', 'mention', 'cinematography', 'locations', 'colors', 'are', 'captured', 'reveal', 'almost', 'magical', 'world', 'golden', 'leaves', 'birch', 'trees', 'snow-swept', 'hills', 'winter.Director', 'Yimou', 'Zhang', 'great', 'job', 'incorporating', 'technology', 'time', 'period', 'many', 'ways', 'was', 'captivated', 'use', 'loom', 'sweatbox', 'used', 'cooking', 'dumplings', 'walk', 'well', 'was', 'sweet', 'love', 'story', 'use', 'black', 'white', 'future', 'then', 'use', 'color', 'past', 'Most', 'directors', 'would', 'do', 'other', 'way', 'yet', 'color', 'used', 'past', 'show', 'revealing', 'happier', 'time', 'when', 'young', 'Zhao', 'Di', 'was', 'fullness', 'life', 'black', 'white', 'showing', 'how', 'life', 'swiftly', 'coming', 'inevitable', 'close', 'loss', 'one', 'true', 'love.The', 'Road', 'Home', 'will', 'capture', 'heart', 'story', 'eyes', 'images', 'Many', 'saints', 'masters', 'philosophers', 'course', 'centuries', 'have', 'stated', 'love', 'actually', 'very', 'simple', 'who', 'make', 'complex', 'beautiful', 'film', 'truly', 'capture', 'idea']",The Road Home

Lots of reminiscing, nostalgia, love, sacrifice. The End.But it is this very simplicity that is stirring. Cinematographically on par with almost anything from Kurosawa, even &quot;Yume&quot;, this is an unembellished but heart-warming story of remembering a timeless love. No quixotic melodrama of Hollywood (a la Titanic) here, no elaborate somatic expressions of hugging/kissing/and all else. Indeed, Zhang Ziyi only needs a twitch of an eye or a shy gesture of the hands to convey an entire page of the script.Doesn't matter whether the story is simple or complex, beautiful or ordinary, Chinese or otherwise -- I'd wager you will definitely come away feeling that you saw a charming, moving vignette of human essence.

""The Road Home"" is everything that ""Erin Brockovich"" isn't:  genuine, moving, sensitive, inspirational.  Sure, the charming and enormously talented Zhang Ziyi (""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"") doesn't shove her {body] in everyone's face, but then she doesn't have to.  She has true substance (and reminds one of a young Audrey Hepburn), creating a character in this film so charismatically decent that it makes the eponymous Brocovich look like a truck stop dumpster.  Ziyi plays Di, a determined, soulful farmgirl who falls in love with a kindly schoolteacher (Zheng Hao), sent to her village in 1950s China.  Told in flashback by their son (Sun Honglei), we discover that despite many obstacles the two marry, an unusual circumstance in a time of arranged marriages, and it is upon the death of the schoolteacher 40 years later while trying to raise money for his school that the second part of the story begins:  that of a son honoring his father.  With no explosions, drug use, foul language, or graphic sex, ""The Road Home"" has only real emotions for its fuel, and yet under the steady hand of director Zhang Yimou, the film makes a bigger impression than any tinny Hollywood blockbuster I've seen in the last ten years.

675249,AMNNPDX9MFEUD,B00005QFE5,Steve,"[3, 3]","In devouring the films of Zhang Yimou lately, I finally got around to The Road Home. I find it amazing that some of the most profound, gorgeous, and unforgettable films are ones I'd scarcely heard of before watching them.Please don't be fooled by the brevity of this review. I've chewed up full pages with reviews of movies I hardly remember let alone enjoyed. But to be fair to my middling skills, there is little I can say about this movie except that it is quite possibly the most beautiful movie I have ever seen.If you're reading reviews of this film, you might already be aware that Yimou makes breathtakingly beautiful and emotionally evocative films. Rarely have I watched one of his films without marveling at the tremendous colors as well as happily giving in and shedding a tear or twenty. Beyond that, however, it is what this movie accomplishes using stunning simplicity that truly makes it noteworthy. How many romantic tales can you recall without the slightest physical interaction? When was the last (or first!) time you saw a movie where love was expressed solely in exquisitely simple tasks such as making a meal, cleaning a chalkboard, weaving a banner, or waiting for your love to walk down the road just so you can steal a heartbreakingly brief look into each other's eyes?  From the very moment that Di and Luo's eyes meet, I was hooked. By the time Luo walks out of the school to see Di, I was a hopelessly blubbering fool in a way that The Notebook to the 10th power could never hope to elicit.But I've said enough. True love is real, true love is forever, and true love is pure and simple. If you believe that, you will absolutely cherish this movie as the rarest of jewels that it most assuredly is.",5,Profoundly beautiful and unforgettable,1316304000,"09 18, 2011",2011,1726,"['devouring', 'films', 'Zhang', 'Yimou', 'lately', 'finally', 'got', 'Road', 'Home', 'find', 'amazing', 'most', 'profound', 'gorgeous', 'unforgettable', 'films', 'are', 'ones', ""'d"", 'scarcely', 'heard', 'before', 'watching', 'them.Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'brevity', 'review', ""'ve"", 'chewed', 'up', 'full', 'pages', 'reviews', 'movies', 'hardly', 'remember', 'let', 'alone', 'enjoyed', 'be', 'fair', 'middling', 'skills', 'little', 'can', 'say', 'movie', 'quite', 'possibly', 'most', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen.If', ""'re"", 'reading', 'reviews', 'film', 'might', 'already', 'be', 'aware', 'Yimou', 'breathtakingly', 'beautiful', 'emotionally', 'evocative', 'films', 'Rarely', 'have', 'watched', 'one', 'films', 'marveling', 'tremendous', 'colors', 'as', 'well', 'happily', 'giving', 'shedding', 'tear', 'twenty', 'Beyond', 'however', 'what', 'movie', 'using', 'stunning', 'simplicity', 'truly', 'noteworthy', 'How', 'many', 'romantic', 'tales', 'can', 'recall', 'slightest', 'physical', 'interaction', 'When', 'was', 'last', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'movie', 'where', 'love', 'was', 'expressed', 'solely', 'exquisitely', 'simple', 'tasks', 'such', 'making', 'meal', 'cleaning', 'chalkboard', 'weaving', 'banner', 'waiting', 'love', 'walk', 'road', 'just', 'so', 'can', 'steal', 'heartbreakingly', 'brief', 'look', 'other', 'eyes', 'very', 'moment', 'Di', 'Luo', 'eyes', 'meet', 'was', 'hooked', 'time', 'Luo', 'school', 'see', 'Di', 'was', 'hopelessly', 'blubbering', 'fool', 'way', 'Notebook', '10th', 'power', 'could', 'never', 'hope', 'elicit.But', ""'ve"", 'said', 'enough', 'True', 'love', 'real', 'true', 'love', 'forever', 'true', 'love', 'pure', 'simple', 'believe', 'will', 'absolutely', 'cherish', 'movie', 'rarest', 'jewels', 'most', 'assuredly']",The Road Home

675252,A3SBVTRU7301II,B00005QFE5,"Thomas Yan Ong ""feilung888""","[2, 2]","&quot;The Road Home&quot; is a moving story of innocent love between Zhao Di (Zhang Ziyi) and the new local teacher from the city.  Zhao Di falls deeply in love with the teacher at first sight.  She does everything she could, in a shy way, to catch his attention.  When he notices her , he also develops a crush, but their romance is cut short when he is sent back to the city to settle some problems with the government.  Zhao Di gets incredibly depressed to the point of her hallucinating, hearing his voice at the local school reciting with his students.  When the day he was to come back, Zhao Di stands on the road side, in freezing weather to wait for him.  He doesn't show and she becomes very ill.  Even the illness didn't stop her determination, when she tries to go the city in the middle of a snow storm to find him, but faints at the side of the road where she is found and brought back home.  The story doesn't end here, so I urge you to see the movie to find out the outcome.  This is Zhang Ziyi's first movie, and it really shows her acting ability and how much she can get into a role.  The story is affective and it's not complicating.  This is a simple, sweet, and yet powerful love story, where you really feel for the characters involved.  This is a movie for all ages.
