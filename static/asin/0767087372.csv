4161,A1I97OYBG64CDD,0767087372,A Reader/Viewer from Northern California,"[132, 143]","It goes without saying that ""Upstairs/Downstairs"" is a brilliant, entertaining series well worth the owning.  When Amazon offered the Collector's Edition Megaset on a great sale, I couldn't pass it up.  I didn't really remember the series well, but I knew I very much wanted to see it.  Like others, I read the discouraging reviews about the A&E Home Video transfer, but I thought, I'm not really that picky and it's probably not all that bad.  Well, I am not that picky; I don't care about things being in HD or looking like a ""Harry Potter"" movie.  That said, I want readers to know, I was very, very disappointed in the visual and sound quality of A&Es Megaset.  So much so, I had given thought to sending this set back and exchanging it for another in hopes that it might be better.  But first I did some research.  I googled ""Why are the DVDs of A&E's Upstairs/Downstairs so bad?"" and found an informative website which had a page on the US A&E version.  It made it clear that A&E Home Video had used old copies of the episodes for their remastering instead of getting new ones from the UK, undoubted a cost saving measure on their part.  As someone who has purchased many of these wonderful, older British series, I can tell you that the A&E version of the Joan Hickson ""Miss Marple""s are not terribly good either, although they are certainly better than these sorry things. I have only taken a quick look at the two Thomas & Sarah DVDs and they do appear to be somewhat better than Upstairs/Downstairs.  Hopefully, someday another company will release a quality set of the original series.",1,MORE ON THE DREADFUL A&E TRANSFER,1191888000,"10 9, 2007",2007,1596,"['saying', 'Upstairs/Downstairs', 'brilliant', 'entertaining', 'series', 'well', 'owning', 'When', 'Amazon', 'offered', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'Megaset', 'great', 'sale', 'could', ""n't"", 'pass', 'up', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'remember', 'series', 'well', 'knew', 'very', 'much', 'wanted', 'see', 'others', 'read', 'discouraging', 'reviews', 'A', 'E', 'Home', 'Video', 'transfer', 'thought', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'picky', 'probably', 'not', 'bad', 'Well', 'am', 'not', 'picky', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'things', 'being', 'HD', 'looking', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movie', 'said', 'want', 'readers', 'know', 'was', 'very', 'very', 'disappointed', 'visual', 'sound', 'quality', 'A', 'Es', 'Megaset', 'So', 'much', 'had', 'given', 'thought', 'sending', 'set', 'back', 'exchanging', 'hopes', 'might', 'be', 'better', 'first', 'did', 'research', 'googled', 'Why', 'are', 'DVDs', 'A', 'E', 'Upstairs/Downstairs', 'so', 'bad', 'found', 'informative', 'website', 'had', 'page', 'US', 'A', 'E', 'version', 'made', 'clear', 'A', 'E', 'Home', 'Video', 'had', 'used', 'old', 'copies', 'episodes', 'remastering', 'instead', 'getting', 'new', 'ones', 'UK', 'undoubted', 'cost', 'saving', 'measure', 'part', 'someone', 'who', 'purchased', 'many', 'wonderful', 'older', 'British', 'series', 'can', 'tell', 'A', 'E', 'version', 'Joan', 'Hickson', 'Miss', 'Marple', 's', 'are', 'not', 'terribly', 'good', 'either', 'are', 'certainly', 'better', 'sorry', 'things', 'have', 'only', 'taken', 'quick', 'look', 'two', 'Thomas', 'Sarah', 'DVDs', 'do', 'appear', 'be', 'somewhat', 'better', 'Upstairs/Downstairs', 'Hopefully', 'company', 'will', 'release', 'quality', 'set', 'original', 'series']",Upstairs Downstairs Complete Series A&E

Initially I was discouraged with it because the first episodes are terrible. But my wife persisted and after six to eight episodes it began to get considerably better. Within ten episodes we were enjoying it a great deal. I think it was because the first episodes were lacking in pathos and charm, the writers trying to keep things a bit dark like an American soap opera. But when they gave that up it took on a life and personality of its own. The first segments (which were filmed in black and white) also had a stagey quality almost like burlesque where the actors overact to convey their emotions over great distances (unnecessary on the small screen obviously). I also had trouble with the son, whom I don't think is quite as strong an actor as the others (such as the actor who plays the butler Hudson, who is excellent) but he gets better as the series progresses.Other actors come and go making a slow but steady evolution toward a very enjoyable ensemble series.",5,Best series and the worst series,1267574400,"03 3, 2010",2010,1056,"['bought', 'wife', 'Christmas', 'began', 'watching', 'shortly', 'thereafter', 'Initially', 'was', 'discouraged', 'first', 'episodes', 'are', 'terrible', 'wife', 'persisted', 'six', 'eight', 'episodes', 'began', 'get', 'considerably', 'better', 'Within', 'ten', 'were', 'enjoying', 'great', 'deal', 'think', 'was', 'first', 'episodes', 'were', 'lacking', 'pathos', 'charm', 'writers', 'trying', 'keep', 'things', 'bit', 'dark', 'American', 'soap', 'opera', 'when', 'gave', 'took', 'life', 'personality', 'own', 'first', 'segments', 'were', 'filmed', 'black', 'white', 'also', 'had', 'stagey', 'quality', 'almost', 'burlesque', 'where', 'actors', 'overact', 'convey', 'emotions', 'great', 'distances', 'unnecessary', 'small', 'screen', 'obviously', 'also', 'had', 'trouble', 'son', 'whom', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'quite', 'strong', 'actor', 'others', 'such', 'actor', 'who', 'butler', 'Hudson', 'who', 'excellent', 'better', 'series', 'progresses.Other', 'actors', 'come', 'go', 'making', 'slow', 'steady', 'evolution', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'ensemble', 'series']",Upstairs Downstairs Complete Series A&E
4169,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,0767087372,Byron Kolln,"[64, 65]","This box set comprises the entire series of UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS (all 68 episodes spread across 20 discs), and is well worth the price.  This wonderful series has become a British institution and a worldwide favorite among viewers.  It has a huge fan following.The story follows the lives and loves of the Bellamy family who reside in a fashionable house in Eaton Place.  Downstairs, their loyal and lively servants uphold their own code of values whilst trying to come to terms with an ever-changing world.  UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS covers the years 1903-1930, and features fantastic writing and direction, not to mention top-drawer performances from a gloriously talented cast.Season 1 - We are introduced to the Bellamy family:  Richard (David Langton), his wife Lady Marjorie (Rachel Gurney) and their grown-up children James (Simon Williams) and Elizabeth (Nicola Pagett).  In the first episode, &quot;On Trial&quot;, we also meet the vivacious Clemence (Pauline Collins) who arrives at 165 Eaton Place looking for a job.  After Lady Marjorie re-names the girl Sarah, she's quickly inducted into the household, but finds life as a servant frustrating and unnatural.Later choice moments in the season include &quot;Magic Casements&quot;, where Lady Marjorie has a brief and tender affair with a young army captain; &quot;The Path of Duty&quot; features the rebellious Elizabeth running away from home on the eve of her society debut; &quot;Why is Her Door Locked?&quot; recounts the unhappy, emotionally-disturbed Mrs Bridges (Angela Baddeley) kidnapping a small child.  The season ends on a hopeful note as Elizabeth marries the romantic poet Lawrence Kirbridge (Ian Ogilvy) in &quot;For Love of Love&quot;.Season 2 - Picks up the story following Elizabeth and Lawrence's honeymoon, and their household in Greenwich.  Humorous scenes downstairs featuring Rose (Jean Marsh), Thomas (John Alderton) and Mrs Fellowes (Dorothy Frere) contrast dramatically with the unhappy marriage of Elizabeth and Lawrence upstairs.Other standout episodes include &quot;Your Obediant Servant&quot;, where Hudson (Gordon Jackson) dresses up as a toff in order to impress his brother's family who are visiting from India; &quot;The Property of a Lady&quot; where Sarah and Thomas attempt to help Lady Marjorie who's being blackmailed about her secret affair from Season 1; and &quot;Out of the Everywhere&quot; where the resourceful Sarah once again saves the day for the Bellamy's.  Perhaps the season is best-remembered for &quot;Guest of Honour&quot; in which King Edward comes to dine at 165.  This season marked the last for Elizabeth, Thomas and Sarah.Season 3 - Another strong season, which gets off to a cracking start in &quot;Miss Forrest&quot;, in which Richard has hired the services of secretary Hazel Forrest (Meg Wynn Owen) while he is busy writing Lord Southwold's political biography.  Lady Marjorie is getting ready for a voyage on the Titanic...Later standouts include &quot;A Perfect Stranger&quot; where Rose gets her first taste of real love when she meets charming Gregory Wilmot (Keith Barron), an Australian sheep-farmer. Romance also keeps up James who impetuously proposes to and marries the mild-mannered Hazel;  &quot;Goodwill to all Men&quot; introduces us to Lord Southwold's young ward Georgina Worsley (Lesley-Anne Down), and a charming storyline featuring the second (and last) appearance of Cathleen Nesbitt as Dowager Lady Southwold.  The season ends on a dramatic note when World War One is declared.Season 4 - Generally regarded by fans as the strongest of the five seasons, with superb acting and cracker storylines.  The season starts off with &quot;A Patriotic Offering&quot; where Lady Prudence (Joan Benham) suggests that Hazel takes in a family of Belgian refugees.  &quot;The Beastly Hun&quot; features an Emmy-winning performance from Gordon Jackson; whilst &quot;If You Were the Only Girl in the World&quot; has Hazel falling in love with a handsome young airman who is later tragically killed in a bombing strike.  The season also introduces us to the charming naval widow Virginia Hamilton (Hannah Gordon), who turns to Richard for help when her oldest son is to be court-martialled.  The season ends on a tragic note when Hazel contracts a severe and dangerous strain of the flu virus just as peace is declared by England.Season 5 - James and Georgina settle into a party lifestyle with their mindless society friends, whilst the newly-married Richard and Virginia settle into life at Eaton Place with her two young children Alice (Anne Yarker) and William (Jonathan Seely).  &quot;A Place in the World&quot; details bored and dissatisfied James following his father in politics; &quot;Disillusion&quot; follows an ill-fated romance between Hudson and young maid Lily (Karen Dotrice), and Georgina toys with a career as a movie actress in &quot;Alberto&quot;.  The season ends with the marriage of Georgina and Robert, the Marquis of Stockbridge (Anthony Andrews).  James returns from a trip to America with big dreams about the Stock Exchange, but then the Wall Street crash puts the financial future of  the Bellamy's in doubt...There aren't enough words to express how much I love UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS.  My favorite moments from the series come mostly from seasons 1 and 2, and while I love the entire series, I particularly love the performances of Nicola Pagett (Elizabeth) and Pauline Collins (Sarah).If you are a fan of the series or a fan of British period drama, then I highly-recommend this superb series!

I can remember watching part of one episode, but it didn't appeal to me. Well, maybe I was too young to appreciate it.Fast forward to a few months ago. Now middle aged, I decided to give this series another try. At first, it seemed OK, but I wasn't sure if I'd want to spend the time getting through the whole series. Didn't seem quite as well done as more recent British TV. But, I watched a few more episodes and got more interested. Before I knew it, I was on the 5th and last series and realized I was almost done. I was sad to see the last episode end. The characters seemed almost like old friends by then.I think the first episode is set in 1903 and the last in 1930. Many characters come and go, but many appear in the whole run like Mr. Hudson, Mrs. Bridges, Rose and Richard Bellamy.The British class system in all its &#34;glory&#34; is illustrated as the series rolls on. And how it starts to unravel a bit as time moves forward. I guess as an American, it is hard to believe how those lower on the food chain put up with this system, but I guess we had something similar at the time here, but maybe less rigid. I'm told that the British still retain a bit of the old system even today, while we seem to have been a little more successful at getting rid of our old system.But, I think one positive point that is often overlooked about the old system is well illustrated. There was some sense of family ties of a sort between the upstairs family and the long time servants downstairs.The series did try to bring to life the big events going on at the time the series is set. It also showed how the upstairs people and the servants saw these events in very similar ways in many cases. I was surprised at how the servants were so often in agreement with the upstairs people on politics. Maybe they all valued stability and tradition very much and so agreed on the politics as a result.Sometimes the formality of the interactions between the upstairs folk and the servants was almost comical, but it was still kind of nice to see it at times. We seem to live in a world without much in the way of good manners anymore.I'm sure that much has been written on the details of the series already by other reviewers, so I don't think there is much I could add there. So, I'll just say that this is a great series to watch and well worth the time required to watch all the episodes.There was a continuation series that aired recently which I did watch well before I got far along in the old series reviewed here.  They don't seem all that related to me now that I have seen all of both. The new series was not very popular and didn't last very long. Two short seasons maybe. I thought it was OK.",5,Great Series,1371513600,"06 18, 2013",2013,2834,"['remember', 'hearing', 'series', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'Probably', 'original', 'US', 'run', '70', 'think', 'reran', 'can', 'remember', 'watching', 'part', 'one', 'episode', 'did', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'Well', 'maybe', 'was', 'too', 'young', 'appreciate', 'it.Fast', 'forward', 'few', 'months', 'ago', 'Now', 'aged', 'decided', 'give', 'series', 'try', 'first', 'seemed', 'OK', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', ""'d"", 'want', 'spend', 'time', 'getting', 'whole', 'series', 'Did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'quite', 'as', 'well', 'done', 'more', 'recent', 'British', 'TV', 'watched', 'few', 'more', 'episodes', 'got', 'more', 'interested', 'knew', 'was', '5th', 'last', 'series', 'realized', 'was', 'almost', 'done', 'was', 'sad', 'see', 'last', 'episode', 'end', 'characters', 'seemed', 'almost', 'old', 'friends', 'then.I', 'think', 'first', 'episode', 'set', '1903', 'last', '1930', 'Many', 'characters', 'come', 'go', 'many', 'appear', 'whole', 'run', 'Mr.', 'Hudson', 'Mrs.', 'Bridges', 'Rose', 'Richard', 'Bellamy.The', 'British', 'class', 'system', '34', 'glory', '34', 'illustrated', 'series', 'rolls', 'how', 'unravel', 'bit', 'time', 'forward', 'guess', 'American', 'hard', 'believe', 'how', 'lower', 'food', 'chain', 'put', 'up', 'system', 'guess', 'had', 'something', 'similar', 'time', 'here', 'maybe', 'less', 'rigid', ""'m"", 'told', 'British', 'still', 'retain', 'bit', 'old', 'system', 'even', 'today', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'more', 'successful', 'getting', 'rid', 'old', 'system.But', 'think', 'one', 'positive', 'point', 'often', 'overlooked', 'old', 'system', 'well', 'illustrated', 'was', 'sense', 'family', 'ties', 'sort', 'upstairs', 'family', 'long', 'time', 'servants', 'downstairs.The', 'series', 'did', 'try', 'bring', 'life', 'big', 'events', 'going', 'time', 'series', 'set', 'also', 'showed', 'how', 'upstairs', 'people', 'servants', 'saw', 'events', 'very', 'similar', 'ways', 'many', 'cases', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'servants', 'were', 'so', 'often', 'agreement', 'upstairs', 'people', 'politics', 'Maybe', 'valued', 'stability', 'tradition', 'very', 'much', 'so', 'agreed', 'politics', 'formality', 'interactions', 'upstairs', 'folk', 'servants', 'was', 'almost', 'comical', 'was', 'still', 'kind', 'nice', 'see', 'times', 'seem', 'live', 'world', 'much', 'way', 'good', 'manners', 'anymore.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'much', 'been', 'written', 'details', 'series', 'already', 'other', 'reviewers', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'much', 'could', 'add', 'there', 'So', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'great', 'series', 'watch', 'well', 'time', 'required', 'watch', 'episodes.There', 'was', 'continuation', 'series', 'aired', 'recently', 'did', 'watch', 'well', 'got', 'far', 'along', 'old', 'series', 'reviewed', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'related', 'now', 'have', 'seen', 'new', 'series', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'popular', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'very', 'long', 'Two', 'short', 'seasons', 'maybe', 'thought', 'was', 'OK']",Upstairs Downstairs Complete Series A&E

4180,A3UC29EJF2ZQP5,0767087372,Duckman,"[5, 5]","I'd been hearing about Upstairs Downstairs for years. Somehow I never saw it when it was aired on PBS and the discs were a bit pricy for a 'hope it's good' purchase.Finally I found this 40th Anniversary set -- produced by Acorn -- at an irresistible price and took the plunge.My wife and I sat down and watched episodes 1 through 3 and each of us had the same reaction. What was all the fuss about?  Upstairs Downstairs seemed to be a mediocre, low-budget, Brit sitcom and nothing more. We took a few days off and then decided to give it another go. And are we glad we did! For starting in episode 4 the entire feel of the series changed from a cheap sitcom to thoughtful human drama.Okay, the ""cheap"" feeling stayed for somewhat longer. Only as the years went by did the production values start to go a bit upscale.  Never near the level of something like Downton Abbey, mind you, but good enough to become invisible.The production and mastering of the Acorn set is so-so at best, both as to image and sound quality and the interface. (Oh, the junk you have to sit through on each year's disc one before the program starts! Ugh!) And instead of defaulting to having no subtitles 4 out of the 5 sets defaulted to subtitles on. Grrr!But the drama itself is the thing and all that technical stuff pales into insignificance once we got absorbed into the characters and the stories. This is human drama as real as life -- full of the complexities, ambiguities, triumphs, joys, disappointments and sorrows of real life and told with feeling and an underlying appreciation for what it means to be human.

Hornaday,"[6, 6]","I rejoice in the technological development of DVDs which provides the perfect format for the celebrated release, in one complete box set, of one of the finest series that has ever graced, or will ever grace, TV!This British series is truly in a ""class"" by itself. It's characters are unforgettable, the acting inspired and the backdrop evocative - Edwardian England from 1904 into the 1930s.The story evolves around the aristocractic Bellamy family ""Upstairs"" at 165 Eaton Place, London, and their servants ""Downstairs,"" but it is not a soap opera. It is as genuine, real and honest as any period production, or for that matter, any production, that I have ever seen.The characters grapple with the same struggles that we continue to confront in mordern-day America: love, loss, coming of age, morality, prejudice, death, economics, social responsibility, unwed mothers, change, freedom and the search for life's ultimate meaning - concluding with the horrendous effects of a World War and its devastating aftermath.The ""master"" of the house, Sir Richard Bellamy, played with genuine heart by David Langton, is in Parliament thanks to the enormous political influence of the family of his well-bred wife, Lady Marjorie Southwold Bellamy, played with aplumb and surprising depth by Rachel Gurney.We come to know the couple and their problems, as we witness a doomed love affair by Marjorie with an artist that she forsakes to save her mariage and which underscores the power of duty in English society. Richard learns of the affair but doesn't address it directly with his wife, whom he resolutely adores, but instead stands by her as she grieves for the one true love she has chosen to give up. Marjorie's life is cut short (the actress left the show after two seasons) after a fateful voyage on the Titanic.The Bellamy's house parlormaid Rose Buck is portrayed by Jean Marsh, who created the show and starred throughout the series. Rose is compassionate, tough and as real a ""person"" as if she had actually been alive.Other tremendous characters of this brilliant ensamble cast include the butler, Angus Hudson, portrayed by the late, great Gordon Jackson, the Bellamy's cook, Mrs. Kate Bridges, played by the late Angela Baddeley, and the Bellamy's son, James Bellamy, played by the gifted Simon Williams.It is Hudson who not only keeps the house running smoothly, but is also the keeper of English social propriety and tradition, objecting to modernization and the merging of social classes. Hudson desperately tries to hold onto the society he knew and loved, but international events conspire to change the very fibre of British culture.But, it is through the character of James Bellamy that these historical events are played out. Initially, a ""useless"" member of the young nobility, James was restless and lived primarily for himself and leisure pursuits. Uncontrollably, he is swept up in the tide that became World War I and changed England, as well as the World, forever.James becomes an officer and sees combat and the horrors of war. James eventually returns to Eaton Place after the war ends, but is unable to cope with his ""new"" life or reclaim his ""old"" one, so he ends it by his own hand in the former safety of the family estate.As the series ends, the Edwardian age of English innocence and ""fun"" has also truly suffered a fatally self-inflicted wound. So, it is fitting that after James' suicide it is the nostalgic Hudson who, with a tear in his eye, closes the house -- and thereby symbolically, the era -- forever.These are only a few of the characters and events that become real in the series, which ran through 68 riviting episodes.This unflinching look at history as well as a truly timeless, engaging family saga is not to be missed. The series was originally broadcast on PBS's Masterpiece Theatre, and was introduced each week by the late popular historian, Allistair Cooke.",5,A Breathtaking Saga of True Life Returns!!!,1115251200,"05 5, 2005",2005,3903,"['rejoice', 'technological', 'development', 'DVDs', 'perfect', 'format', 'celebrated', 'release', 'one', 'complete', 'box', 'set', 'one', 'finest', 'series', 'ever', 'graced', 'will', 'ever', 'grace', 'TV', 'British', 'series', 'truly', 'class', 'characters', 'are', 'unforgettable', 'acting', 'inspired', 'backdrop', 'evocative', 'Edwardian', 'England', '1904', '1930s.The', 'story', 'evolves', 'aristocractic', 'Bellamy', 'family', 'Upstairs', '165', 'Eaton', 'Place', 'London', 'servants', 'Downstairs', 'not', 'soap', 'opera', 'genuine', 'real', 'honest', 'period', 'production', 'matter', 'production', 'have', 'ever', 'seen.The', 'characters', 'grapple', 'same', 'continue', 'confront', 'mordern-day', 'America', 'love', 'loss', 'coming', 'age', 'morality', 'prejudice', 'death', 'economics', 'social', 'responsibility', 'unwed', 'mothers', 'change', 'freedom', 'search', 'life', 'ultimate', 'meaning', 'concluding', 'horrendous', 'effects', 'World', 'War', 'devastating', 'aftermath.The', 'master', 'house', 'Sir', 'Richard', 'Bellamy', 'played', 'genuine', 'heart', 'David', 'Langton', 'Parliament', 'thanks', 'enormous', 'political', 'influence', 'family', 'well-bred', 'wife', 'Lady', 'Marjorie', 'Southwold', 'Bellamy', 'played', 'aplumb', 'surprising', 'depth', 'Rachel', 'Gurney.We', 'come', 'know', 'couple', 'problems', 'witness', 'doomed', 'love', 'affair', 'Marjorie', 'artist', 'save', 'mariage', 'power', 'duty', 'English', 'society', 'Richard', 'affair', ""n't"", 'address', 'directly', 'wife', 'whom', 'resolutely', 'instead', 'stands', 'one', 'true', 'love', 'chosen', 'give', 'up', 'Marjorie', 'life', 'cut', 'short', 'actress', 'left', 'show', 'two', 'seasons', 'fateful', 'voyage', 'Titanic.The', 'Bellamy', 'house', 'parlormaid', 'Rose', 'Buck', 'portrayed', 'Jean', 'Marsh', 'who', 'created', 'show', 'starred', 'series', 'Rose', 'compassionate', 'tough', 'real', 'person', 'had', 'actually', 'been', 'alive.Other', 'tremendous', 'characters', 'brilliant', 'ensamble', 'cast', 'include', 'butler', 'Angus', 'Hudson', 'portrayed', 'late', 'great', 'Gordon', 'Jackson', 'Bellamy', 'cook', 'Mrs.', 'Kate', 'Bridges', 'played', 'late', 'Angela', 'Baddeley', 'Bellamy', 'son', 'James', 'Bellamy', 'played', 'gifted', 'Simon', 'Williams.It', 'Hudson', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'house', 'running', 'smoothly', 'also', 'keeper', 'English', 'social', 'propriety', 'tradition', 'objecting', 'modernization', 'merging', 'social', 'classes', 'Hudson', 'desperately', 'hold', 'society', 'knew', 'loved', 'international', 'events', 'conspire', 'change', 'very', 'fibre', 'British', 'culture.But', 'character', 'James', 'Bellamy', 'historical', 'events', 'are', 'played', 'out', 'Initially', 'useless', 'member', 'young', 'nobility', 'James', 'was', 'restless', 'lived', 'primarily', 'leisure', 'pursuits', 'Uncontrollably', 'swept', 'up', 'tide', 'became', 'World', 'War', 'changed', 'England', 'as', 'well', 'World', 'officer', 'sees', 'combat', 'horrors', 'war', 'James', 'eventually', 'Eaton', 'Place', 'war', 'unable', 'cope', 'new', 'life', 'reclaim', 'old', 'one', 'own', 'hand', 'former', 'safety', 'family', 'series', 'Edwardian', 'age', 'English', 'innocence', 'fun', 'also', 'truly', 'suffered', 'fatally', 'self-inflicted', 'wound', 'So', 'fitting', 'James', 'suicide', 'nostalgic', 'Hudson', 'who', 'tear', 'eye', 'house', 'thereby', 'symbolically', 'era', 'forever.These', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'characters', 'events', 'become', 'real', 'series', 'ran', '68', 'riviting', 'episodes.This', 'unflinching', 'look', 'history', 'as', 'well', 'truly', 'timeless', 'engaging', 'family', 'saga', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'series', 'was', 'originally', 'broadcast', 'PBS', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre', 'was', 'introduced', 'week', 'late', 'popular', 'historian', 'Allistair', 'Cooke']",Upstairs Downstairs Complete Series A&E

The one series that a lot of people clamour about is this one: Upstairs Downstairs: The life of the Bellamy family and their servants in a story spanning the early decades of the 20th Century.  When this series first hit DVD, it was released in 5 sets of 4 discs, and then a megaset of all 20, followed by the 4 disc set of its spinoff (not sure it was seen here) Thomas & Sarah (all of which are still available).

4192,AJ8JJ6D5BSJKZ,0767087372,Gary M. Greenbaum,"[138, 141]","It wasn't commercial.  It wasn't conventional.  It dealt with issues not often talked about in the early 70s, both the social issues that permiate through the series, and also such issues, in certain episodes, as prejudice, suicide, and homosexuality.This is the story of the Bellamy household at 165 Eaton Place, London, both the upstairs family (the Bellamy family, led by Richard Bellamy, a member of Parliament) and the downstairs family (the servants, led by Angus Hudson, the butler, who in his way is more aristocratic than the aristocrats).  Yet in many ways, they are a single family, and we see them from the period 1905 to the 1920s, an era of profound social change, and we see the effects such changes have on this household, from a time when going ""into service"" was routine to the time when having half a dozen servants for a small upper middle class family such as the Bellamys was beginning to be the exception, not the rule.The series includes rarely shown episodes from the 1st season, as well as the special, Upstairs Downstairs Remembered: The 25th Anniversary Special.  While the special is included with the first series episodes, I would advise waiting until you have viewed the entire series before watching the special, to avoid any plot points being given away.The acting is wonderful, led by Gordon Jackson (as Hudson, the butler), David Langton (as Richard Bellamy), and Jean Marsh (as house parlormaid Rose Buck).  Marsh also originated and guided the series.  These three characters seem like rocks, upon which the waves of the social changes beat.  Yet they are worn and changed by the events of this incredible era.  Nonetheless, this is very much an ensemble cast--no character appears in more than 60 of the 68 episodes.The first season seems almost experimental--many of the episodes have specific themes, such as those mentioned above.  A couple were unsuccessful and their events are never referred to again (for example, ""The Swedish Tiger"").  In the remaining seasons, events tend to build over the thirteen episodes, to culminate to some extent in the final episode of the season, which usually deals with a major event in the world (for example the King's death at the end of the second season, the start of the war in the third, the end of the war in the fourth).Perhaps the most powerful episodes are those dealing with World War I, and the profound waste of the war, as many of the best of the generation are lost.  By the end of the War, there has been tremendous tragedy, and even the most ardent supporter of the war doubts the justice of the war.  But do not underestimate the fifth season, as the social structure crumbles.  The signs of this crumbling are seen throughout the earlier episodes, but they come to a head in the fifth season.I have tried  to avoid discussing the plot, so as not to give away the plot events that should come as a surprise to you.  But suffice it to say that this is one of the first series when anything can happen within the framework of the series, when you could not count on everything ending happily by the end of the hour--or at all.Brilliant.

The aristocratic Bellamy's of 165 Eaton Place, London, live upstairs over the downstairs clockwork servant aid led by butler Hudson (Gordon Jackson). Classic Edwardian masterful plots in this funny and dramatic back time-travel over 3 decades inside the Bellamy house. A crowning British achievement in the 70's and worth owning today.Sir Richard Bellamy MP (David Langton) and Lady Marjorie (Rachel Gurney) have heir Lt James (Simon Williams) and Miss Elizabeth (Nicola Pagett-`A Bit of a Do') who need quite a crew downstairs to keep their house in order. Mrs. Bridges (Angela Brddeley) cooks up a storm, while maid Rose (Jean Marsh, co-creator) helps keep linens and affairs tidy. The pilot (an alternate plot pilot available) introduces new servant Sarah (Pauline Collins), who adds saucy spice to the house on both ends of the stairs. Footman Alfred (George Innes) who quotes Bible, Perce (Brian Osborne) is lady's-man coachman during carriage years, Thomas (John Alderton) chauffeur in later auto episodes. The star studded cast is endless.This new release provides 21 discs in 5 solid cases all in the anniversary storage sleeve.

The features + bonus time total divided by the current Amazon price makes the HOURLY entertainment cost less than $1.87. A VALUE!SUBTITLES-THIS SET OFFERS SUBTITLES. Helpful for some of us.  A Jean Marsh memories insert is included and created in Oct. 2010.SERIES 1: 1903-09, introduces cast, Bellamy house trials, scandal, love, and the delight of seeing the wonderfully differences between the working and upper classes. Great plots in every episode, too many to list. Always sub-plots, upstairs and downstairs. Delightful set and an array of costuming that shows both the upper and lower class dress of the times.SERIES 2: 1908-10, shows life with a newly married Bellamy, potential fatherhood, and romance downstairs too. All scandalous in high society, as is several topics this show dared to address in the 70s. Cast members playing Sarah and Thomas would eventually marry in real-life.SERIES 3: 1912-14, the period finds Kind Edward VII is dead and pending war. World war and politics are just a fraction of the turmoil found at house 165. Love upstairs and downstairs is as treacherous as the war trenches. Reason enough for this seasons' best drama series Emmy & Golden globe.SERIES 4: 1914-18, the Great War is happening, and it touches the Bellamy house stairway ends. Another 2 Emmys won due to struggles with soldiering, war efforts, changes in lifestyle due to war, and love at all times. A fine dramatic, but historical look at WWI, on the London home front.SERIES 5: 1919-30, the largest span of time. War's end. The 1920's roar, and that impacts the family upstairs as well as the lively help downstairs. But even war fails to change some things, like scandal, family disgrace, celebrations, and again the outstanding drama series Emmy and the prestigious Peabody Award.After the airing of ""The Forsyte Saga"" (a must series also), Eileen Atkins and Jean Marsh dreamed up the ""Upstairs Downstairs"" concept. Jean stared as Rose in the 70s TV blockbuster, and now continues that role in the continuation of the story on Brit TV (Dec '10). 3 episodes advance the story now to 1936, with a new cast (excepting Marsh) and also now including Atkins as Maud, the same house, same music, same title. After ""Upstairs Downstairs"" the pair of actresses combined again in creating ""The House of Eliott"", another period saga, bloody good Brit drama, an absolute must own ""complete collection.""There you have my lengthy opinion, but so much in this anniversary edition.

Bacon ""Joan""","[0, 0]","I won't go into many details about the series, since it is so well documented in the other comments, but I wanted to write a review to encourage anyone who is only thinking about buying the Upstairs/Downstairs series to do it!  When the series was airing in the '70's, my mother would often talk me into watching an episode or two with her. It was almost as much fun watching how much she enjoyed the show and wanted to talk about it.  So now years later, I took the plunge and bought the whole series. My husband and I, while watching the first couple of episodes, noticed a couple of episodes were in black and white (found out later that it was due to a workers strike going on at the time), but in general the quality never distracts from the story.  We got absolutely hooked on it, and the question was always how many episodes can we watch today?  You truly get attached to the characters and miss them when they're gone.  Unlike American TV, most times indiscretions and misbehavior come at a price. I love the subtleties imbedded throughout, and the wonderful humor. I enjoyed learning British history in such a personal way, not just regarding the relationships within the class system, but also of World War I, some British politics, and life in general at the turn of the century through about 1930.... all from the British perspective. Another enjoyable feature of the series was that so often they required its audience to ""fill in the blanks"" of what sorts of things must have happened in-between scenes or chapters of the story, rather than droning on about endless details that would be obvious (typical fare in most movies nowadays).A reunion episode is included which helped to tie up some loose ends about the Upstairs/Downstairs story development and characters.The Thomas and Sarah episodes are a nice way to gently say good-bye to the whole Upstairs/Downstairs experience, as from time to time, there is a touch of its story that intertwines with the previous series, but also stands in its own right with entertaining stories.",5,Going through Upstairs/Downstairs withdrawal,1291680000,"12 7, 2010",2010,2049,"['wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'many', 'details', 'series', 'so', 'well', 'documented', 'other', 'comments', 'wanted', 'write', 'review', 'encourage', 'anyone', 'who', 'only', 'thinking', 'buying', 'Upstairs/Downstairs', 'series', 'do', 'When', 'series', 'was', 'airing', ""'70"", 'mother', 'would', 'often', 'talk', 'watching', 'episode', 'two', 'was', 'almost', 'much', 'fun', 'watching', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'show', 'wanted', 'talk', 'So', 'now', 'years', 'later', 'took', 'plunge', 'bought', 'whole', 'series', 'My', 'husband', 'watching', 'first', 'couple', 'episodes', 'noticed', 'couple', 'episodes', 'were', 'black', 'white', 'found', 'out', 'later', 'was', 'due', 'workers', 'strike', 'going', 'time', 'general', 'quality', 'never', 'story', 'got', 'absolutely', 'hooked', 'question', 'was', 'always', 'how', 'many', 'episodes', 'can', 'watch', 'today', 'truly', 'get', 'attached', 'characters', 'miss', 'when', ""'re"", 'gone', 'American', 'TV', 'most', 'times', 'indiscretions', 'misbehavior', 'come', 'price', 'love', 'subtleties', 'imbedded', 'wonderful', 'humor', 'enjoyed', 'learning', 'British', 'history', 'such', 'personal', 'way', 'not', 'just', 'regarding', 'relationships', 'class', 'system', 'also', 'World', 'War', 'British', 'politics', 'life', 'general', 'turn', 'century', '1930', 'British', 'perspective', 'enjoyable', 'feature', 'series', 'was', 'so', 'often', 'required', 'audience', 'fill', 'blanks', 'what', 'sorts', 'things', 'must', 'have', 'happened', 'in-between', 'scenes', 'chapters', 'story', 'rather', 'droning', 'endless', 'details', 'would', 'be', 'obvious', 'typical', 'fare', 'most', 'movies', 'nowadays', '.A', 'reunion', 'episode', 'included', 'helped', 'tie', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'Upstairs/Downstairs', 'story', 'development', 'characters.The', 'Thomas', 'Sarah', 'episodes', 'are', 'nice', 'way', 'gently', 'say', 'good-bye', 'whole', 'Upstairs/Downstairs', 'experience', 'time', 'time', 'touch', 'story', 'previous', 'series', 'also', 'own', 'right', 'entertaining', 'stories']",Upstairs Downstairs Complete Series A&E

4200,A1EARN5PUVIF1S,0767087372,Jerry P. Danzig,"[3, 3]","What a pleasure to be able to watch every episode of ""Upstairs Downstairs"" at your own pace, with NO commercials or fundraising breaks!I was surprised watching this megaset how many episodes I don't recall ever seeing.  I'm not sure whether that's because I was out of the house at the time -- in the days before VCRs -- or because some of the episodes have elements reflecting the racism, anti-semitism, or other unfortunate aspects of the Edwardian age which U.S. networks elected not to broadcast.At any rate, one need look no further than the brilliant first episode to see why this series is one of the best -- if not the single best -- historical drama ever, and every bit as captivating today as when it was originally broadcast.With clockwork precision, the first episode introduces us to the aristocratic Bellamy family who live upstairs at 165 Eaton Place, and their staff of devoted servants working downstairs.  We see how the house functions, in particular the duties of the servants through the course of the day -- and we are introduced to one of the richest casts of characters this side of Dickens.The steadfast and resourceful Hudson the butler, played by the late, great Gordon Jackson... the fastidious Mrs. Bridges the cook, played by Angela Baddeley... Rose the parlor maid, played by series co-creator Jean Marsh... Mr. and Lady Bellamy, played by David Langton and Rachel Gurney... their children James and Elizabeth, played by Simon Callow and Nicola Paget... all are indelible creations magnificently realized.In the course of the series, the years from the first quarter of the twentieth century come to life with an unerring eye for detail, from the advent of electricity in the home to the adoption of the automobile to the crackle of the first crystal radios and early victrolas to the sinking of the Titanic to the horrors of World War I and the crash of the stock market in 1929.Watching the series again, I was moved to tears on a number of occasions.  I felt as if I was spending time with a dear family I hadn't seen in many years.This megaset also includes a twenty-fifth anniversary special that reunited many of the cast members to reminisce about the production.  One of the most amusing anecdotes comes from series co-creator Marsh, who recalls that there were ""upstairs"" dressing rooms for the cast and ""downstairs"".  The former had windows and boxes of tissue; the latter did not.  The Bellamy family cast were automatically assigned the ""upstairs"" dressing rooms -- until Marsh finally spoke up and noted that as series co-creator, she deserved a box of tissues as much as Rachel Gurney!Then there is the spinoff series, ""Thomas and Sarah"", featuring the ever-scheming, never-succeeding former chauffeur and maid of the Bellamy household, which I consider more of a curiosity than a drama as compelling as ""Up Down"" itself.  Still it is a welcome inclusion for dedicated fans.I have deducted one star for the technical problems of this DVD set, which have been cited by other reviewers as well.  A&E; obviously didn't lavish the same attention to detail on the mastering of these discs as the writers, directors, and actors who created the show, and it's a shame.  Especially annoying are the little boxes of ""digital dither"" that appear in the upper right corners of many episodes, plus the nonexistent color correction in others.Still, these technical issues detract only slightly from the breathtaking panoply of the drama unfolding here, and at a price around half that of the box set when it was first introduced, this megaset still merits inclusion in a British television enthusiast's collection.One hopes, as others have noted, that A&E; will eventually release an improved megaset that clears up these technical issues and perhaps includes another set of reminiscences from the series creators and television commentators.Until then -- ""look sharp,"" as Hudson would say, and order this spectacular set to enjoy with your family!",4,The Greatest Drama Series Ever?,1253664000,"09 23, 2009",2009,3980,"['What', 'pleasure', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'episode', 'Upstairs', 'Downstairs', 'own', 'pace', 'commercials', 'fundraising', 'breaks', 'was', 'surprised', 'watching', 'megaset', 'how', 'many', 'episodes', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'ever', 'seeing', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'house', 'time', 'days', 'VCRs', 'episodes', 'have', 'elements', 'reflecting', 'racism', 'anti-semitism', 'other', 'unfortunate', 'aspects', 'Edwardian', 'age', 'U.S.', 'networks', 'elected', 'not', 'broadcast.At', 'rate', 'one', 'need', 'look', 'further', 'brilliant', 'first', 'episode', 'see', 'why', 'series', 'one', 'best', 'not', 'single', 'best', 'historical', 'drama', 'ever', 'bit', 'captivating', 'today', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'broadcast.With', 'clockwork', 'precision', 'first', 'episode', 'introduces', 'aristocratic', 'Bellamy', 'family', 'who', 'live', 'upstairs', '165', 'Eaton', 'Place', 'staff', 'devoted', 'servants', 'working', 'downstairs', 'see', 'how', 'house', 'functions', 'particular', 'duties', 'servants', 'course', 'day', 'are', 'introduced', 'one', 'richest', 'casts', 'characters', 'side', 'Dickens.The', 'steadfast', 'resourceful', 'Hudson', 'butler', 'played', 'late', 'great', 'Gordon', 'Jackson', 'fastidious', 'Mrs.', 'Bridges', 'cook', 'played', 'Angela', 'Baddeley', 'Rose', 'parlor', 'maid', 'played', 'series', 'co-creator', 'Jean', 'Marsh', 'Mr.', 'Lady', 'Bellamy', 'played', 'David', 'Langton', 'Rachel', 'Gurney', 'children', 'James', 'Elizabeth', 'played', 'Simon', 'Callow', 'Nicola', 'Paget', 'are', 'indelible', 'creations', 'magnificently', 'realized.In', 'course', 'series', 'years', 'first', 'quarter', 'twentieth', 'century', 'come', 'life', 'unerring', 'eye', 'detail', 'advent', 'electricity', 'home', 'adoption', 'automobile', 'crackle', 'first', 'crystal', 'radios', 'early', 'victrolas', 'sinking', 'Titanic', 'horrors', 'World', 'War', 'crash', 'stock', 'market', '1929.Watching', 'series', 'again', 'was', 'moved', 'tears', 'number', 'occasions', 'felt', 'was', 'spending', 'time', 'dear', 'family', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'many', 'years.This', 'megaset', 'also', 'twenty-fifth', 'anniversary', 'special', 'reunited', 'many', 'cast', 'members', 'reminisce', 'production', 'One', 'most', 'amusing', 'anecdotes', 'series', 'co-creator', 'Marsh', 'who', 'were', 'upstairs', 'dressing', 'rooms', 'cast', 'downstairs', 'former', 'had', 'windows', 'boxes', 'tissue', 'latter', 'did', 'not', 'Bellamy', 'family', 'cast', 'were', 'automatically', 'assigned', 'upstairs', 'dressing', 'rooms', 'Marsh', 'finally', 'spoke', 'up', 'noted', 'series', 'co-creator', 'deserved', 'box', 'tissues', 'as', 'much', 'Rachel', 'Gurney', 'Then', 'spinoff', 'series', 'Thomas', 'Sarah', 'featuring', 'ever-scheming', 'never-succeeding', 'former', 'chauffeur', 'maid', 'Bellamy', 'household', 'consider', 'more', 'curiosity', 'drama', 'as', 'compelling', 'Down', 'Still', 'welcome', 'inclusion', 'dedicated', 'fans.I', 'have', 'deducted', 'one', 'star', 'technical', 'problems', 'DVD', 'set', 'have', 'been', 'cited', 'other', 'reviewers', 'well', 'A', 'E', 'obviously', 'did', ""n't"", 'lavish', 'same', 'attention', 'detail', 'mastering', 'discs', 'writers', 'directors', 'actors', 'who', 'created', 'show', 'shame', 'Especially', 'annoying', 'are', 'little', 'boxes', 'digital', 'dither', 'appear', 'upper', 'right', 'corners', 'many', 'episodes', 'nonexistent', 'color', 'correction', 'others.Still', 'technical', 'issues', 'detract', 'only', 'slightly', 'breathtaking', 'panoply', 'drama', 'unfolding', 'here', 'price', 'box', 'set', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'introduced', 'megaset', 'still', 'inclusion', 'British', 'television', 'enthusiast', 'collection.One', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'A', 'E', 'will', 'eventually', 'release', 'improved', 'megaset', 'technical', 'issues', 'perhaps', 'set', 'reminiscences', 'series', 'creators', 'television', 'commentators.Until', 'then', 'look', 'sharp', 'Hudson', 'would', 'say', 'order', 'spectacular', 'set', 'enjoy', 'family']",Upstairs Downstairs Complete Series A&E

It contains 68 episodes on 20 DVDs, plus one DVD with quite a few bonus features The first season comprises 13 episodes and the first episodes seem spare, especially in the dialog--more like stage plays than video dramas of today's miniseries.  Later episodes lose that stagey-ness and become very involved dramas. Since the original series broadcast in the US did not include the black-and-white episodes,  I was not familiar with the development of the series and how it grew from a rather simple initial season to rather involved arcs. For that ALONE, I'd recommend this set of DVD's because seeing them all in series is fascinating. And I saw entirely new episodes (for me) as I'd missed a lot of the first seasons, being off at college and without a television for some years.I was also able to look at the opening titles with the drawings from ""Punch"" (A British humor magazine) and admire how the producers selected amazingly apt drawings to fit the particular episode.Some of the initial episodes, sadly, are recorded only in black and white due to a technicians' strike in the early 70's. It doesn't actually detract from the enjoyment, just makes it a bit sad we can't see the sets and costuming as they were filmed. The black & white are sharp and clear, but the color episodes can be somewhat lower in resolution. The colors can be dim as well, but it doesn't detract. The cropping is often odd. This is not a perfect conversion from the television to DVD, but it's adequate and probably a lot has to do with changes in technologies since the 70's and the early days of television-to-DVD remastering.The extras are lavish:Extras:5-part documentary: The Making of Upstairs Downstairs24 episode commentariesUpstairs, Downstairs Remembered - with Gareth Hunt (51:50)Russell Harty Goes Upstairs Downstairs (30:00)Sandy's Last Stand with composer Alexander Faris (13:15)Simon Williams and Alfred Shaughnessy in Conversation (22:50)""Russell Harty Plus"" Interview with Gordon Jackson (6:40)""Russell Harty Plus"" Interview with Jean Marsh (11:15)""Russell Harty Plus"" Interview with Angela Baddeley (9:40)Alternate version of Episode 1 ""On Trial""Essay by star and co-creator Jean MarshIt's nice to go visit old friends again and have all the episodes and extras.

4204,A1M1Y5UGONAW06,0767087372,Jody,"[15, 15]","I remember looking forward to Sunday nights in the 1970's, when Upstairs, Downstairs was Masterpiece Theater's offering, introduced by the divine Alistair Cooke.  When this DVD set arrived, I hoped that at least it could recreate the Edwardian world for me, as it did 30+ years ago.  I was wrong.  It is so much better than I remember.  With the perspective and experience of thirty years coloring the viewing, the foibles and triumphs of the two families upstairs and down are so much more compelling now.  With the underlying theme that the house must run smoothly no matter what is going on in the inside or outside world, the dependence of the two families on each other is beautifully portrayed.  The period details, down to the china patterns and the paint colors are exquisite, and the characterizations the actors bring to their parts, made possible by the very fine writing, superb.From the first episode when Lady Marjorie hires Sarah ""On Trial"" and gently but firmly establishes Sarah's position in the household, through the elegance and grandeur of the Edwardian era, ""There's no one to touch you, Mrs. Bridges, when it comes to lamb,"" the exigencies of WWI, when poor shell-shocked Edward the footman is cared for by Lord Bellamy; to the bittersweet end, when Lord Bellamy's diatribe when James loses Rose's inheritance in the stock market crash of 1929, causes a tragedy; the delicate balance between upstairs and down is fascinating and amazing to watch.  The pride the servants take in the successes of the upstairs family, which their support makes possible, and the avuncular care with which the Bellamys ""look after"" the servants (""I hate to see servants humiliated,"" says Georgina, when unexpectedly confronted with Frederick in an embarassing situation) make this series particularly fascinating to Americans, for whom this way of life has never existed.Despite bombs falling, housemaids giving birth in the attic, party guests committing suicide outside the nursery, various forms of heartbreak occuring both upstairs and down, it's reassuring to know that at 165 Eaton Place, dinner will always be served by an impeccably clad butler on impeccably polished silver, and that tea in the servant's hall will always be accompanied by one of Mrs. Bridges' delicious cakes (when she's not in a snit about being made to go to a lecture on wartime cookery).No, the quality of the DVDs is not the best, but given a choice between owning it, with all its glitches and jumps--and not having it available at all--I'll take it. There are no problems distracting enough to make it unwatchable. This remarkable series has stood the test of time and truly shines.  The fine writing, splendid acting and authentic sets involve the viewer in the stories to the extent that the minor jumps and glitches are unimportant.

4205,A2TUA4VWCMNXI,0767087372,John D. Cofield,"[0, 0]","Upstairs Downstairs is the example par excellence of British television.  Over five seasons during the 1970s, Upstairs Downstairs riveted audiences in Britain, while in America, it more than any other series made Masterpiece Theater an essential part of Sunday evening television.Upstairs Downstairs is the story of the Bellamy family of 165 Eaton Place, London from about 1903 to 1930.  The Bellamys are an aristocratic family with a houseful of servants.  The interplay of story line and personality between Upstairs (the Bellamys and their friends and relatives) and Downstairs (the assorted servants) was beautifully done.  Some of the episodes tended to be a bit too soap operaish, but at its best the series was utterly spellbinding and memorable.This megaset contains every episode of the original five seasons.  Some of the transfers are not all that clear, and a few of the openings have been truncated or even omitted entirely.  The megaset also contains a spin off of the series, Thomas and Sarah, based on the lives of two of the servants after they left 165.  Thomas and Sarah has nowhere near the quality of the original series and does not, in my opinion, deserve to be grouped with it.

It was a superb piece of writing, production and acting. Historically accurate. Produced in the 1970's, it held the whole of Britain in suspense. In the very final episode there is a remarkable development broadcast as breaking news on all radio stations. One of the reasons that it is so accurate is that the writers had access to older people who had worked as servants in their youth. In fact my own paternal grandmother was one such person, and at age 80 odd, was the series keenest watcher.One of the clever tricks played by the writers and a device worthy of the attention of all writers is to set the series in a small London House that is a microcosm of life in the big country houses. Wonderful interplay between well defined characters. Totally believable and smooth chronological development. Acting at its very best. Be aware that this is not necessarily light fluffy entertainment. It tells the story of the hardship of life below stairs and the superior indifference to that hardship by the family upstairs.  Importanty, we see the social structure below stairs with the total control by the butler who in a sense is the most important person in the house.  Amidst all the tears and very occasional laughter we learn about Edwardian England and its slow journey into the 1920's.It rates as one of the great TV dramas, and as a commentary on London in the early 20th century, can stand head high amongst the best of drama.",5,The Ultimate TV series.,1351296000,"10 27, 2012",2012,1546,"['So', 'much', 'been', 'written', 'Upstairs', 'Downstairs', 'unnecessary', 'repeat', 'details', 'was', 'superb', 'piece', 'writing', 'production', 'acting', 'Historically', 'accurate', 'Produced', '1970', 'held', 'whole', 'Britain', 'suspense', 'very', 'final', 'episode', 'remarkable', 'development', 'broadcast', 'breaking', 'news', 'radio', 'stations', 'One', 'reasons', 'so', 'accurate', 'writers', 'had', 'access', 'older', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'worked', 'servants', 'youth', 'fact', 'own', 'paternal', 'grandmother', 'was', 'one', 'such', 'person', 'age', '80', 'odd', 'was', 'series', 'keenest', 'watcher.One', 'clever', 'tricks', 'played', 'writers', 'device', 'worthy', 'attention', 'writers', 'set', 'series', 'small', 'London', 'House', 'microcosm', 'life', 'big', 'country', 'houses', 'Wonderful', 'interplay', 'well', 'defined', 'characters', 'Totally', 'believable', 'smooth', 'chronological', 'development', 'Acting', 'very', 'best', 'Be', 'aware', 'not', 'necessarily', 'light', 'fluffy', 'entertainment', 'story', 'hardship', 'life', 'stairs', 'superior', 'indifference', 'hardship', 'family', 'upstairs', 'Importanty', 'see', 'social', 'structure', 'stairs', 'total', 'control', 'butler', 'who', 'sense', 'most', 'important', 'person', 'house', 'tears', 'very', 'occasional', 'laughter', 'learn', 'Edwardian', 'England', 'slow', 'journey', ""1920's.It"", 'rates', 'one', 'great', 'TV', 'dramas', 'commentary', 'London', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'can', 'stand', 'head', 'high', 'best', 'drama']",Upstairs Downstairs Complete Series A&E

4211,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,0767087372,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[330, 345]","I suspect that many people shopping this new release of ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" for its fortieth anniversary commemoration (which happens to coincide with a new version coming to PBS later in 2011) will already be familiar with the series.  Many, like I do, might already own the previous version of the complete series on DVD.  It's been out of print for several years, so I'm thrilled to see this magnificent and ground breaking series back on the marketplace.  If you have never seen or do not own ""Upstairs, Downstairs""--then my recommendation is a no-brainer.  Get it!  However, what I wanted to know and any previous owners might be itching to know--is it an upgrade worthy of reinvestment?While I love my current DVD collection, it's not a particularly high quality transfer.  After researching this new set through PBS directly, I am reporting that there are NO promises on the reworking of visual or audio components.  The same proclamation that was on the last DVD issue is on this one--""digitally remastered for presentation on DVD.""  So it appears to be a strict reissue, not new re-mastering.  It does, however, seem to be drawn from a clearer source material with a cleaner picture quality thankfully.  The features of the 68 episodes on 21 DVDs include a 5-part documentary ""The Making of Upstairs, Downstairs,"" 24 episode commentaries, 25th anniversary retrospective ""Upstairs, Downstairs Remembered,"" Interviews with the stars, composer, and editor, Alternate pilot episode, and an essay by star and co-creator Jean Marsh.  Obviously the 25th anniversary retrospective was included on the prior release--so that leaves the documentary, some interviews, and commentary and as much as I love ""Upstairs, Downstairs""--I can't justify repurchasing the set for this reissue.In no way, however, would I discourage anyone from enjoying the goings-on at 165 Eaton Place.  Smart and sophisticated, this saga told through five seasons (1971-1975) is the epitome of quality television.  What many may not realize however, is how truly progressive it was--how ""of the time.""  It covered several controversial issues that were considered taboo for traditional network fare in the seventies.  Impressive for its huge and talented cast, stellar scripts, and exquisite use of period details (Titanic, Wall Street), this Edwardian soap opera set the standard for British drama and was embraced by American audiences as well.  Set initially in the years preceding World War 1, ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" really engaged the viewer and adopted to the historical significance in each season culminating in some strong war period episodes in Season 4.  But by embracing the inhabitants--both masters and servants--at Eaton Place, ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" undeniably succeeds at human drama with fully realized portrayals.  The winner of 9 Emmys, ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" has earned its place in TV history.  If you don't own it, why not?

Remember, we might not have had a WWII, if WWI hadn't been dealt with the way it was.  Upstairs, Downstairs does deal with WWI and all the difficulties associated with it, both mentally and physically from the perspective of the soldiers and the homefront.The series also deals with themes that history often glosses over, such as the wealthy being just as prone as the poor to having affairs.  That's a theme Victorian and Edwardian society glossed over.The only downside was this series covered about 20 years in not enough episodes.

4216,AVT7DW1N4GHFP,0767087372,L'escribe,"[8, 10]","Let me first begin by saying that I remember watching Up/Down when it first aired 40 years ago, as a then vulnerable and impressionable young lass of 17. I enjoyed the show immensely, it was really rather a first offering of PBS, then known primarily as a fledgling ""artsy"" station, presenting this hitherto unknown British series through WGBH in Boston. From its first episode, Up/Down oozed quality in every way: superb acting, writing, direction, production, with the added bonus of Alistair Cooke's introduction, while seated in a leather armchair next to a roaring fire prior to each episode, to the accompaniment of the famous Masterpiece Theatre theme, Mouret's Rondo, which added to the understated elegance and anticipation of each episode.The characters of Up/Down were many faceted and always interesting, not merely presented as one-dimensional, i.e., rich versus poor. One could even sympathize with the clueless and wealthy Bellamy family on occasion, theirs was a cocoon of privilege and comfort, yet their breeding never eschewed vulgarity or crassness, but embraced kindness, concern and responsible humanity toward their Downstairs ""family"". Similarly, their Downstairs family, in turn, showed respect, warm feelings of pride of service and true concern for their ""upstairs"" family as well. The viewer was entwined in the lives of both ""families"", experiencing their joys, sorrows and frustrations. All within a 25 year framework encompassing the Victorian and Edwardian ages, culminating in the death of Edward VII, the sinking of the Titanic and loss of Lady Marjorie Bellamy, World War I and its aftermath, the Roaring Twenties and the Great Depression, forever changing the world of the Bellamys first shown in 1904. Up/Down is, simply, a breathtakingly unforgettable series.This 40th anniversary release is equal to the many superlatives written on these pages of reviews. I had VHS taped some of the original Up/Down episodes when they were re-shown on PBS in the 80's, which I still have. However, I wanted the DVD version, and decided to purchase this 40th anniversary set through Amazon.  Let me say that it is simply superb in every way.The episodes have been remastered to splendid effect, they are all excellent in both video and audio quality. I do not understand how some of the reviewers could state that they are not! They are all exceptionally good.  There are 21 DVD's in this set, with an added 25 hours of extras, narrating the making of Up/Down,interviews with many of the characters who are still living, and they seem to enjoy reminiscing, sharing many little unknown facts about the particular episodes being presented. Priceless. There are also narratives and commentaries in the episodes by some of the actors, scene selection, and an enclosed brief written narrative by Jean Marsh, one of the co-creators who also portrayed Rose, the under-house parlor maid. The audio commentaries by the actors and writers on each episode are great fun, listening to Jean Marsh and Simon Williams' comments give one a marvelous insider perspective. This is the definitive collection, it just doesn't get much better than this. I urge all Up/Down devotees, new and old, to purchase it. Also, the price on Amazon is about the lowest I have seen anywhere. It is well worth the price for this timeless and iconic series, presented as grandly as the series itself.

A story about the Bellamy family and their servants, it goes beyond any kind of play or soap (quite frankly, I think it merged qualities of both quite successfully)--but it draws you INTO the family and you feel like you actually become a PART of the whole thing. Troubles? Sure always troubles with both the wealthy family and troubles with the servants. But even in real life, it always has trouble, doesn't it. Frequently very touching; sometimes even shocking; it's GREAT! I LOVE THESE DVDs! I don't give a flip what other people say about the alleged picture and sound quality ""troubles"".  I say, honestly, just WHERE are these alleged ""toubles""--remember it was made for television; in fact during some of the early season you have some black and white episodes due to some kind of technical crew strike or whatever. But it's just a few shows but WHO CARES it's all great.I found nothing wrong with either the quality of the DVDs picture and sound.

However, since I am such a fan of Downton Abbey, I thought I would give it a try. And I am so glad I did. It begins in 1903 when there were still horse drawn carriages and strict rules of decorum, and goes through WWI, the roaring twenties, and into the Great Depression. I found the families very enduring, both upstairs and downstairs, and their struggles very real. You will love the characters: Mrs. Bridges, Ruby, Mr. Hudson, Rose, Edward, Sara, Thomas, Fredrick, and Daisy, and last, but not least, the Bellamy family and their friends.It does not necessarily have a happy ending, but it is a satisfying one. I will be sure to watch this series again and again. I think it gives a good insight into the history of the time as well as telling an enduring story. It shows the decline of the noble class in England, how it began and came about. That was a little sad to me because I think we lost something of elegance and grace along the way to progress, and I could not help feeling that I wished we had at least some of it back. All in all, this is a very good series. I wish there had been more of it. I would have liked to seen what happened to the characters during the Great Depression.The newer, more modern, series is also good, but sadly it was not renewed so it really does not have an ending, happy or otherwise. I was really looking forward to see how England survived WWII. Perhaps they will rethink the decision to cancel it and bring it back.

It is one of the greatest television dramas of all time, and easily the best ever within its genre.  But the quality of the DVD transfer here is, while often ""passable"" as I originally stated, is at other times downright awful!  The sound is bad.  The picture quality is often worse!  Such a legendary show deserves the best technology and care when being made into a DVD box set, and I do hope that the owners of this material one day invest the money and effort to do it.  I'd be first in line to buy such a product.  But again, its such a great show that even watching a poor transfer brings great joy.And now, here is my original review....I recall my parents watching this wonderful program when I was a child.  Last autumn it was announced that all new episodes were being made and that Jean March would be reprising her role as Rose.  I thought I would buy and watch all the episodes in advance of the 2011 release of the new series.First, let me say a word about some of the low reviews here, which give this DVD set only one or two stars.  All of them say the same thing.  They praise the series but are greatly disappointed at the video transfer quality.  I will ignore the transfer quality issues in this review.  It probably could have been better, and I hope one day a more definitive version is released.  But most of the time its not bad, and in fact more than passable.  If there were a separate rating system for the technical qualities of old TV shows being transferred to DVD, then that's where this DVD set would probably not score high.Well, having made those initial disclaimers, I guess I don't actually have a lot to say, other than this show's writing is brilliant, its acting is superb, and it captures the early 20th century so perfectly.  Its a series full of warmth, hilarity, intrigue, and suspense.

So, do they wait to start work on the series when all the techs are back OR do they just go ahead and film the thing in B&W; with poor sound etc etc ....Yup you guessed it .. they started the series in B&W; cause the execs at BBC never really expected this series to take off.This may have been very good and well back in the 1970's but they should have explained it to the buyers of the DVD set that the first few DVD's of this box set are in B&W; and really really bad production... It took  me a while checking my equipment and the disks to realize what they did .. menu in colour and movie in B&W; ... thanks!I sort of expected the DVD set to improve after disk three when it switched to colour but, trust me you could clearly see a substandard production of the 1970's .... I guess for the purists they did nothing to fix the production with today's modern sound, video enhancement programs/computers  ... What you saw is what you got ....OK so I am really bugged out because I bought the box sets of 'The Forsythe Saga' and of 'Horatio Hornblower' series that were produced and published by the same BBC and A&E; people, so you can probably understand why I was so so disappointed with this 'megaset' .....The three star rating on this set is certainly deserved by the writing, scriting, casting and most certainly the acting ... the directors and the producers though should be punished....",3,Overpriced and overated ......

4249,AY3AVLL5IWW9,0767087372,Russell Fanelli,"[17, 18]","Upstairs, Downstairs is, in my opinion, the finest extended series of films ever made for television. Spanning five seasons, the writing, acting, and directing were uniformly excellent.Upstairs are the Bellamy family. The two members that continue for all five seasons are Richard Bellamy, a member of Parliament, and his son James, a Captain in the English army. Downstairs are the servants who are led for all five seasons by Hudson, the butler, Mrs. Bridges, the cook, and Rose, a maid. The performances by all these principals were excellent in every respect.Dozens of other characters come in and out of the various plots throughout the years. Most notable are Richard Bellamy's first wife Lady Marjorie and a niece, Georgina. Downstairs Edward, the footman and chauffeur, his wife Daisy, and Ruby, helper to Mrs. Bridges, all played important roles in the series.Many things make this series great and the stories come first. The Bellamy family and their servants are living in tumultuous times, the first thirty years or so of the 20th Century. The 1st World War, ""the war to end all wars,"" was a defining moment in time for the English, the Bellamy family, and their servants. The war changed everyone and everything forever and this series does justice to the horror of that terrible event and its impact on the lives of the English people.But the war is only a part of the story line, albeit an important one. We come to know the Bellamys and their servants almost as well as our own family. In fact, they seem to become a part of our family, so real are the stories and the performances of the actors. Rarely have actors in a television series ever been able to provide so much depth of characterization. This is due largely to the fine direction and superb dialogue of the scripts for each episode of the series.For the most part the action takes place in the Bellamy's London home. Over five seasons we see little of London except through the windows of the Bellamy's house. The war footage is a notable exception to this statement. Even so, enough is happening under that roof to keep us genuinely interested and engaged.I had not seen this series when it originally aired thirty years ago and only by accident saw a video of a first season episode. I was quickly ""hooked"" and then watched the rest of the five seasons on DVD. Other than taking less room on your shelf, the DVDs did not appear to me to be much better than the video I viewed.It seemed to me as if the program, like a fine wine, aged gracefully and improved over time. I know that I enjoyed each season just a bit more than the last and with great regret watched the final episodes. It was as if I were saying goodbye forever to close friends and family.This series is good enough for a repeat viewing and so I have the deferred pleasure of knowing I will be reintroduced to the Bellamys and all their servants at some later time. However, for the first-time viewer, a real treat is in store for you!",5,The finest extended series of films ever made for TV.,1044403200,"02 5, 2003",2003,2980,"['Upstairs', 'Downstairs', 'opinion', 'finest', 'extended', 'series', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'television', 'Spanning', 'five', 'seasons', 'writing', 'acting', 'directing', 'were', 'uniformly', 'excellent.Upstairs', 'are', 'Bellamy', 'family', 'two', 'members', 'continue', 'five', 'seasons', 'are', 'Richard', 'Bellamy', 'member', 'Parliament', 'son', 'James', 'Captain', 'English', 'army', 'Downstairs', 'are', 'servants', 'who', 'are', 'led', 'five', 'seasons', 'Hudson', 'butler', 'Mrs.', 'Bridges', 'cook', 'Rose', 'maid', 'performances', 'principals', 'were', 'excellent', 'respect.Dozens', 'other', 'characters', 'come', 'various', 'plots', 'years', 'Most', 'notable', 'are', 'Richard', 'Bellamy', 'first', 'wife', 'Lady', 'Marjorie', 'niece', 'Georgina', 'Downstairs', 'Edward', 'footman', 'chauffeur', 'wife', 'Daisy', 'Ruby', 'helper', 'Mrs.', 'Bridges', 'played', 'important', 'roles', 'series.Many', 'things', 'make', 'series', 'great', 'stories', 'come', 'first', 'Bellamy', 'family', 'servants', 'are', 'living', 'tumultuous', 'times', 'first', 'thirty', 'years', 'so', '20th', 'Century', '1st', 'World', 'War', 'war', 'end', 'wars', 'was', 'defining', 'moment', 'time', 'English', 'Bellamy', 'family', 'servants', 'war', 'changed', 'everyone', 'everything', 'forever', 'series', 'justice', 'horror', 'terrible', 'event', 'impact', 'lives', 'English', 'people.But', 'war', 'only', 'part', 'story', 'line', 'important', 'one', 'come', 'know', 'Bellamys', 'servants', 'almost', 'as', 'well', 'own', 'family', 'fact', 'seem', 'become', 'part', 'family', 'so', 'real', 'are', 'stories', 'performances', 'actors', 'Rarely', 'have', 'actors', 'television', 'series', 'ever', 'been', 'able', 'provide', 'so', 'much', 'depth', 'characterization', 'due', 'largely', 'fine', 'direction', 'superb', 'dialogue', 'scripts', 'episode', 'series.For', 'most', 'part', 'action', 'place', 'Bellamy', 'London', 'home', 'five', 'seasons', 'see', 'little', 'London', 'windows', 'Bellamy', 'house', 'war', 'footage', 'notable', 'exception', 'statement', 'Even', 'so', 'enough', 'happening', 'roof', 'keep', 'genuinely', 'interested', 'engaged.I', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'series', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'thirty', 'years', 'ago', 'only', 'accident', 'saw', 'video', 'first', 'season', 'episode', 'was', 'quickly', 'hooked', 'then', 'watched', 'rest', 'five', 'seasons', 'DVD', 'Other', 'taking', 'less', 'room', 'shelf', 'DVDs', 'did', 'not', 'appear', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'video', 'viewed.It', 'seemed', 'program', 'fine', 'wine', 'aged', 'gracefully', 'improved', 'time', 'know', 'enjoyed', 'season', 'just', 'bit', 'more', 'last', 'great', 'regret', 'watched', 'final', 'episodes', 'was', 'were', 'saying', 'goodbye', 'forever', 'close', 'friends', 'family.This', 'series', 'good', 'enough', 'repeat', 'viewing', 'so', 'have', 'deferred', 'pleasure', 'knowing', 'will', 'be', 'reintroduced', 'Bellamys', 'servants', 'later', 'time', 'However', 'first-time', 'viewer', 'real', 'treat', 'store']",Upstairs Downstairs Complete Series A&E

Frankly, there is nothing shown today on American television that is remotely as fine a series as this one.These were the final days of the British Empire and the family portrays the last vestiges of a different way of living in early 20th century England.  The upper classes DID live quite differently than your family or mine. This series  allows us to hear the gossip 'downstairs' in the servants' areas and to peep in on the privileged lives led by the family 'upstairs'.I wish this series, or one similar to it, would be reprised.  I sorely miss the fine acting, story lines, period costumes, speech, manners, and entertainment of this bygone era.There are occasional moments when the sound is not perfectly clear.

4254,AI0KXH1O95X0H,0767087372,"Sir Robert ""Order of the Anglophiles""","[5, 6]","I now see why many people adore ""Upstairs Downstairs,"" and also why it has its place among classic television. The whole show is actually a time capsule during the time of pre-WWI UK and after (up to the US stock market crash in 1929.) It is very interesting to note the various stages of changes that were happening during that time. It's like a history lesson but with more fun in it (apologies to my History teacher.) In this, the makers of this wonderful miniseries did not fail in their mission to make things as authentic as possible. Personally, I cannot boast about knowing much about English soceity during the Edwardian era, for my knowledge of it actually comes from period movies and television programs that I had seen before. But when I said ""authentic,"" what I meant was that we can see and feel the labour of love that was put into every detail to make the show feel at home in its period setting.In addition, this is no ordinary soap opera because it really has a lot of things to say about many issues. One might think that the people who inhabit the stories are shallow and uninteresting. After all, what can be interesting about the lives of parlourmaids, footmen, or drawing room ladies? But then, in ""Upstairs Downstairs,"" you will find otherwise because the writers somehow managed to give the stories and the characters flesh and blood, as well as humor and tears. Though dignified as the ""Upstairs"" masters may be, the writers prove that these people are not infallible, and that they are as susceptible to mistakes as any other class of human being. As for the ""Downstairs"" servants, though they toil all day long, we see that they do have lives of their own that are also interesting.Having said the above, I guarantee that you will root for most of the characters. I love Lady Marjorie the best; captivating Georgina, no-nonsense Hazel, and Virginia as the second Mrs. Bellamy I love second. They are such adorable and charming people. I shall never forget that scene where Lady Marjorie tells Hudson the butler that ""the King will be dining with us next week."" She was picture-perfect in that one. As for the men, I always admire Mr. Bellamy for his political convictions. Although we don't actually get to see the hearings in the House of Commons, we do get a firsthand look of what goes on behind the life of a parliament member. It is this aspect of the show that gives ""Upstairs Downstairs"" its political dimension. As for Elizabeth and James, I disliked them most of the time because they are spoiled, but they do have their human moments. Plus, Nicola Pagett and Simon Williams are such good, good actors. These two have some of the best parts in the whole series; Simon Williams, especially, as James, during the War years and after that.Going now to the servants, there's Edward and his pretty wife Daisy. There's also Rose, who really lost a chance at the one happiness that she could have get (find it out for yourself.) Mr. Hudson, I sometimes find disappointing because of his prejudiced views. But during the times when he is in his right principles, you will admire him for it. Mrs. Bridges might be scoldy, but she really is a mother at heart, having no children of her own. It may surprise you to find out that she never had a husband. Ruby the scullery maid might be trivial, but she does have the spotlight in ""The Hero's Farewell,"" one of my favorite episodes. She also has a funny line at the final episode where she was contemplating that it won't be long before she gets the guesthouse all to herself. As for Thomas and the scene stealing Sarah, you will either like them or dislike them, but they do have their place in the story.The last episode is a touching one, since we would have gotten used to the characters and feel that we know them already. I was sorry to see the members of the Bellamy household disbanded like that. I especially felt heart-pangs when Rose (Jean Marsh) was closing down the empty house. The ghosts of the past whispered into her ears as she did this, from floor to floor of 165 Eaton Place. These final few minutes of the show will not soon go away from your memory,.As companions to this series, I would like to recommend the ""Berkeley Square"" Series and Stephen Poliakoff's ""The Lost Prince."" Both of these can be had here at Amazon. There is no doubt that ""Berkeley Square"" had its roots in ""Upstairs Downstairs."" To see ""Berkeley Square"" is to extend the enjoyment after viewing ""Upstairs Downstairs."" But to get a better understanding of the political situation of the time period, I would recommend Stephen Poliakoff's ""The Lost Prince."" This is considered to be one of Mr. Poliakoff's best works. I guarantee that ""Berkeley Square"" and ""The Lost Prince"" will not disappoint. Both are BBC productions.Overall, I highly recommend the show, definitely a keeper. Some of the episodes might not be appropriate for younger viewers, as they touch on subjects about homosexuality, a murder, and suicides. The episode ""Alberto"" might also not be suitable for younger audiences, because it has an element worthy of an ""R"" rating. Other than that, it's mostly safe. The best part of the show was during the years of the War, when everybody had to make sacrifices, and when nothing was really certain. One lesson that the show teaches many a time is that WORDS CAN HURT. Parents will do wise to instill this into the minds of youngsters.A word about picture quality: since this is a show over thirty years of age, one mustn't give it a lot of expectations. I think there's a limit of what our current technology can do in the field of DVD transfer. I personally don't mind the sometimes grainy quality (plus the black and white of the first few episodes) because it gives it more vintage. What I do complain grievely about is the lack of subtitles; and, there's not much of a bonus feature.",5,Ten Stars for the Bellamy Household,1162080000,"10 29, 2006",2006,5866,"['now', 'see', 'why',

4258,A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F,0767087372,"Terrance Richard ""Terry Richard""","[87, 95]","One of the most successful British television dramas, ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" became one of the few english programs to attain global recognition, garnering an impressive seven american Emmy awards when it originally aired between 1971-1975. Most Americans saw the series when it ran on local PBS stations and later cable's A&E; channel, while Canadians viewed it via the CBC.The series dealt with the rich and the poor and as any lover of soap opera knows when you pit these two types of people together fireworks will ignite. Indeed a soap, ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" dealt with the rich Bellamy family living in the high class Belgravia neighborhood in London. Their lives were intertwined by their servants who lived ""downstairs"" and who wanted to attain the richness and social standing of their employers. World War 1 was the backdrop for the serial which only added extra drama to the show.""Upstairs, Downstairs"" is known as the series where many Hollywood leading ladies received their start, most notably Jean Marsh (who had a hand in the creation of the show) and Lesley-Ann Down, most famous for her role in ""North and South"" and currently starring in ""The Bold and the Beautiful"".This beautiful box set contains 21 DVD's featuring all the show's 68 episodes and has a plethora of extras that include over 25 hours of never-before-seen footage! The bonus features include a 5 part documentary called ""The Making of ""Upstairs, Downstairs"", 24 episode commentaries, interviews with cast members, and more. Sadly, when the producers went into the ITV archives to clean the show's original prints it was discovered the pilot had been ""wiped"" which was the custom for many British shows in the early seventies.The first two seasons of ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" (known as ""series"" in Britain) will be available individually with the release of the entire series box set. The remaining three seasons will be on store shelves before the end of 2011.The series has been revived on the BBC as of late 2010.",5,"""It's Tea Time!""",1295308800,"01 18, 2011",2011,1999,"['One', 'most', 'successful', 'British', 'television', 'dramas', 'Upstairs', 'Downstairs', 'became', 'one', 'few', 'english', 'programs', 'attain', 'global', 'recognition', 'garnering', 'impressive', 'seven', 'american', 'Emmy', 'awards', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', '1971-1975', 'Most', 'Americans', 'saw', 'series', 'when', 'ran', 'local', 'PBS', 'stations', 'later', 'cable', 'A', 'E', 'channel', 'Canadians', 'viewed', 'CBC.The', 'series', 'dealt', 'rich', 'poor', 'lover', 'soap', 'opera', 'when', 'pit', 'two', 'types', 'people', 'together', 'fireworks', 'will', 'ignite', 'Indeed', 'soap', 'Upstairs', 'Downstairs', 'dealt', 'rich', 'Bellamy', 'family', 'living', 'high', 'class', 'Belgravia', 'neighborhood', 'London', 'lives', 'were', 'intertwined', 'servants', 'who', 'lived', 'downstairs', 'who', 'wanted', 'attain', 'richness', 'social', 'standing', 'employers', 'World', 'War', '1', 'was', 'backdrop', 'serial', 'only', 'added', 'extra', 'drama', 'show', 'Upstairs', 'Downstairs', 'known', 'series', 'where', 'many', 'Hollywood', 'leading', 'ladies', 'received', 'start', 'most', 'notably', 'Jean', 'Marsh', 'who', 'had', 'hand', 'creation', 'show', 'Lesley-Ann', 'Down', 'most', 'famous', 'role', 'North', 'South', 'currently', 'starring', 'Bold', 'Beautiful', '.This', 'beautiful', 'box', 'set', '21', 'DVD', 'featuring', 'show', '68', 'episodes', 'plethora', 'extras', 'include', '25', 'hours', 'never-before-seen', 'footage', 'bonus', 'include', '5', 'part', 'documentary', 'called', 'Making', 'Upstairs', 'Downstairs', '24', 'episode', 'commentaries', 'interviews', 'cast', 'members', 'more', 'Sadly', 'when', 'producers', 'went', 'ITV', 'clean', 'show', 'original', 'prints', 'was', 'discovered', 'pilot', 'had', 'been', 'wiped', 'was', 'custom', 'many', 'British', 'shows', 'early', 'seventies.The', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'Upstairs', 'Downstairs', 'known', 'series', 'Britain', 'will', 'be', 'available', 'individually', 'release', 'entire', 'series', 'box', 'set', 'remaining', 'three', 'seasons', 'will', 'be', 'store', 'shelves', 'end', '2011.The', 'series', 'been', 'revived', 'BBC', 'late', '2010']",Upstairs Downstairs Complete Series A&E
4259,A2Z13QAST1E7Q9,0767087372,"Tiggah ""the Anglophile""","[0, 0]","It is no exaggeration to say that this classic early 70's British period drama is one of the all-time best series of its sort ever produced.  The series covers a time span of nearly 30 years (from early Edwardian England in 1903, through the horrors of the First World War and the Roaring 20s, finally concluding with 1929's stock market crash). The setting is the household of the Bellamy family at 165 Eaton Place, London. Upstairs live Richard Bellamy, MP, and his beautiful, aristocratic wife, Lady Margery. The Bellamys have two adult children, Captain James and Elizabeth, who come and go much like a recurring motif (though recurring nightmare might be more appropriate, for they are the source of much grief (albeit unintended) for their society parents). I don't wish to give the storylines, scandals and surprises away. Suffice it to say that as the series progress, there are lovers, marriages, births and deaths (not to mention the arrival of a beautiful young niece) which impact on the relationships and alter the composition of the group above stairs.Downstairs we are privy to the lives of the servants in the Bellamy household. First and foremost is the devout, inflexible and regimental head butler, Angus Hudson, the staff overlord. Then there is the curmudgeonly but good-hearted cook, Mrs. Bridges. Other memorable characters include the efficient but sheltered head house/parlour maid, Rose Buck; the religious but simple footman, Alfred; his successor, the good-natured Edward, who has something of an eye for the female staff; the not-overly-bright scullery maid, Emily, and her successor and intellectual equal, Ruby; and Lady Margery's prim and snobbish lady's maid, Miss Roberts.  Of course, one simply cannot forget the sassy, vivacious new under house/parlour maid, Sarah (Pauline Collins), who is a real dreamer and schemer, or the new chauffeur, Thomas (John Alderton--Collins' real-life husband), who is nobody's fool!  Like the family upstairs, the downstairs ""family"" too has its share of comings and goings, what with lovers, marriages, deaths, hirings, and firings.The boxed set contains all five series (with a total of 68 episodes).  Series one and two cover the Edwardian period from 1903 to King Edward's death in 1910. There is little change in the household throughout these two series, and although the entire series is spectacular, these first two sets are my favourite. Series three covers the period from 1912 to the start of WWI. Series four covers the war (1914-1918), and its depiction of the realities of war from the human standpoint is unsurpassed, making series four a very, very strong series indeed. Series five covers the twenties.In conclusion, this is quite simply an outstanding dramatic series. I would, in fact, go so far as to say that it is required viewing for anyone who enjoys first-rate period drama. But its appeal is broad enough to be enjoyed by anyone who enjoys compelling, captivating, and often thought-provoking drama; and if you enjoy a dramatic series with lots of ""goings on,"" scandal, and so forth, you'll enjoy it all the more! It's a large set, but it's well worth taking a chance on.  I simply cannot imagine anyone not enjoying it.  Those who've enjoyed Upstairs Downstairs will surely want to check out The Duchess of Duke Street (both of which were produced by John Hawkesworth).",5,An Outstanding British Period Drama!,1155427200,"08 13, 2006",2006,3364,"['exaggeration', 'say', 'classic', 'early', '70', 'British', 'period', 'drama', 'one', 'all-time', 'best', 'series', 'sort', 'ever', 'produced', 'series', 'time', 'span', 'nearly', '30', 'years', 'early', 'Edwardian', 'England', '1903', 'horrors', 'First', 'World', 'War', 'Roaring', '20s', 'finally', 'concluding', '1929', 'stock', 'market', 'crash', 'setting', 'household', 'Bellamy', 'family', '165', 'Eaton', 'Place', 'London', 'Upstairs', 'live', 'Richard', 'Bellamy', 'MP', 'beautiful', 'aristocratic', 'wife', 'Lady', 'Margery', 'Bellamys', 'have', 'two', 'adult', 'children', 'Captain', 'James', 'Elizabeth', 'who', 'come', 'go', 'much', 'recurring', 'motif', 'recurring', 'nightmare', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'appropriate', 'are', 'source', 'much', 'grief', 'unintended', 'society', 'parents', 'do', ""n't"", 'wish', 'give', 'storylines', 'scandals', 'away', 'Suffice', 'say', 'series', 'progress', 'are', 'lovers', 'marriages', 'births', 'deaths', 'not', 'mention', 'arrival', 'beautiful', 'young', 'niece', 'impact', 'relationships', 'alter', 'composition', 'group', 'stairs.Downstairs', 'are', 'privy', 'lives', 'servants', 'Bellamy', 'household', 'First', 'foremost', 'devout', 'inflexible', 'regimental', 'head', 'butler', 'Angus', 'Hudson', 'staff', 'overlord', 'Then', 'curmudgeonly', 'good-hearted', 'cook', 'Mrs.', 'Bridges', 'Other', 'memorable', 'characters', 'include', 'efficient', 'sheltered', 'head', 'house/parlour', 'maid', 'Rose', 'Buck', 'religious', 'simple', 'footman', 'Alfred', 'successor', 'good-natured', 'Edward', 'who', 'something', 'eye', 'female', 'staff', 'not-overly-bright', 'scullery', 'maid', 'Emily', 'successor', 'intellectual', 'equal', 'Ruby', 'Lady', 'Margery', 'prim', 'snobbish', 'lady', 'maid', 'Miss', 'Roberts', 'course', 'one', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'forget', 'sassy', 'vivacious', 'new', 'house/parlour', 'maid', 'Sarah', 'Pauline', 'Collins', 'who', 'real', 'dreamer', 'schemer', 'new', 'chauffeur', 'Thomas', 'John', 'Alderton', 'Collins', 'real-life', 'husband', 'who', 'nobody', 'fool', 'family', 'upstairs', 'downstairs', 'family', 'too', 'share', 'comings', 'goings', 'what', 'lovers', 'marriages', 'deaths', 'hirings', 'firings.The', 'boxed', 'set', 'five', 'series', 'total', '68', 'episodes', 'Series', 'one', 'two', 'cover', 'Edwardian', 'period', '1903', 'King', 'Edward', 'death', '1910', 'little', 'change', 'household', 'two', 'series', 'entire', 'series', 'spectacular', 'first', 'two', 'sets', 'are', 'favourite', 'Series', 'three', 'period', '1912', 'start', 'WWI', 'Series', 'four', 'war', '1914-1918', 'depiction', 'realities', 'war', 'human', 'standpoint', 'unsurpassed', 'making', 'series', 'four', 'very', 'very', 'strong', 'series', 'indeed', 'Series', 'five', 'twenties.In', 'conclusion', 'quite', 'simply', 'outstanding', 'dramatic', 'series', 'would', 'fact', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'required', 'viewing', 'anyone', 'who', 'first-rate', 'period', 'drama', 'appeal', 'broad', 'enough', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'anyone', 'who', 'compelling', 'captivating', 'often', 'thought-provoking', 'drama', 'enjoy', 'dramatic', 'series', 'lots', 'goings', 'scandal', 'so', 'forth', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'more', 'large', 'set', 'well', 'worth', 'taking', 'chance', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'not', 'enjoying', 'who', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'Upstairs', 'Downstairs', 'will', 'surely', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'Duchess', 'Duke', 'Street', 'were', 'produced', 'John', 'Hawkesworth']",Upstairs Downstairs Complete Series A&E
4260,A3OH36BA3YSN7M,0767087372,timcon1964,"[3, 4]","One of the greatest dramatic series of all time, Upstairs Downstairs (U/D) is about life at 165 Eaton Place in Belgravia, one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in London.  It reflects the tensions between masters and servants, between different categories of servants, and between the existing order and those who do not fully accept it--servants who aspire to careers outside of domestic service, persons motivated by middle-class values, and the nouveau riche who respect money and power more than tradition.  Both upstairs and downstairs residents are influenced by British imperialism and xenophobia.British actresses Jean Marsh and Eileen Atkins conceived U/D as a comedy focused on the downstairs staff.  But it gradually evolved into a drama about the entire household--both upstairs and downstairs.  London Weekend producer Cyril Bennett did not believe that U/D would be successful.  He held Series 1 off the air for six months, then chose to broadcast it at 10:15 on Sunday nights.  Despite this scheduling, the show became one of the most popular PBS programs of all time.The household is headed by Richard Bellamy (David Langton), the son of a clergyman, who has married Lady Marjorie, scion of the prominent Southwold family.  As a political and social conservative, Richard attains high administrative offices, but, as a member of Parliament, he prefers to vote according to his conscience rather than the Southwold family's preferences.  Lady Marjorie (Rachel Gurney) is imperious and aristocratic.  Their son James (Simon Williams), an army officer, is plagued by such bad judgment that we generally cannot sympathize with him.  His sister Elizabeth (Nicola Pagett) is idealistic and romantic, but unrealistic.  Her relations with the male sex always turn out badly, until (having left U/D after Series 2) she is said to have found marital happiness in America.  Following Marjorie's death, management of the household falls to James's new wife Hazel (Meg Wynn Owen), the daughter of an accountant, who is guided by different values than other members of the Bellamy family.  Marjorie's niece Georgina (Lesley-Anne Down) arrives in Series 3, with a sense of idealism and adventure.  After the war, Richard marries Virginia (Hannah Gordon), who provides companionship and support.The downstairs staff is directed by the butler, Hudson (Gordon Jackson), who relies on discipline to preserve traditional standards, and discretion to prevent scandal, but can be sympathetic when the occasion warrants.  Mrs. Bridges (Angela Baddeley), the cook, overcomes kitchen crises and follows household gossip.  Rose (Jean Marsh), the head house parlor maid, later ladies maid, is devoted to the family, but occasionally expresses dissatisfaction with her ""place"" in the system.  Under house parlor maid Sarah (Pauline Collins) makes up in imagination what she lacks in education; anxious to escape domestic service, she becomes a chorus girl.  Chauffeur Thomas Watkins (John Alderton) is something of a con-artist, but he evidently has genuine affection for Sarah.  Under house parlor maid Daisy (Jacqueline Tong) marries footman Edward (Christopher Beeny) and attempts to advance his career.  At the bottom of the servants' hierarchy is the kitchen maid Ruby (Jenny Tomasin).Interestingly, all the award nominations went to the downstairs actors, although it seemed to this reviewer that nearly all the actors put in strong performances.  Two personal favorites are Raymond Huntley's portrayal of the very formal, punctilious, and bespectacled family solicitor, Sir Geoffrey Dillon; and Jenny Tomasin's performance as the uneducated and unrespected scullery maid Ruby.  Tomasin took to heart Jackson's comment that there were no small parts, only small actors, and her rendering of Ruby may become a model for future actresses.  Fortunately, there are occasions on which Ruby knows more than the other servants, and when she shows initiative by leaving 165 Eaton Place to take a factory job, and by soliciting correspondence through a dating service--these events prevent Ruby from becoming a caricature.The 68 episodes vary in quality; but there are few really poor ones.  The stories deal with a wide range of matters, including family relations, infidelity, divorce, inappropriate pregnancies, miscarriages, espionage, murder, suicide, casualties of war, politics, and the consequences of prosperity and depression.  Many episodes are connected to such real events as the death of Edward VII, World War I, the Silvertown munitions factory explosion, the 1926 General Strike, and the Stock Market Crash.  The producers gave great attention to verisimilitude -for example, consulting with Buckingham Palace staff regarding protocol for hosting the king's visit to 165 Eaton Place.Many viewers consider Series 1 (1903-1909) the least successful.  (Most of this series was not aired in the U.S. until many years later.)  It had a lower budget than subsequent series; and, due to a technicians' strike, the first half dozen episodes were filmed in black and white.  Writers, directors, and actors were still trying to set the parameters for the program.  As a result, this series includes several strange stories; and some characters (especially the footman Alfred), lack credibility.  Some performances are too loud, too demonstrative, and poorly choreographed.  Many of the stories in Series 2 (1908 - 1910) provide various perspectives on marriage; others deal with problems created by a superannuated nanny and by Elizabeth's suffrage activities.  King Edward VII is a dinner guest in one episode; and this series ends with his death.  Series 3 (1912 - 1914) witnesses the arrival of Hazel Forrest as Richard Bellamy's secretary, and her marriage to James Bellamy.  Lady Marjorie having died on the Titanic, Hazel assumes the management of the household.  She eventually overcomes downstairs resentment; but her middle-class outlook leads to clashes with Richard and James.  This series ends with the outbreak of World War I.  The war casts a shadow over Series 4 (1914-1918), which many consider the best.  The Bellamys take in a family of Belgian refugees, James Bellamy and footman Edward join the army, other members of the household take on war-related duties; and a local baker, of German descent, becomes a victim of anti-German hysteria.  The war impacts the household in various ways--the staff must dine on ersatz meat and potatoes, James comes home severely wounded, and the house is hit by a bomb.  Series 5 (1919-1930) deals with life in the 1920s.  Richard finds happiness with his new wife Virginia.  But old values are challenged, as the younger generation engage in wild parties and other reckless behavior, aided by such new technologies as autos, airplanes, and motion pictures.  As a result of the stock market crash and the Depression, both upstairs and downstairs residents must leave Eaton Place to start new lives elsewhere.It has been said that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery; and U/D has had several imitators, including Beacon Hill (1975), as well as a new Upstairs Downstairs (2010-2012).  But the program's real heir is Downton Abbey (2010-  ).  Consider the similarities:  In both the wealth comes from the woman's side of the family.  Both Richard (U/D) and Robert (DA) are in precarious financial situations:  When Marjorie dies, the family fortune goes to Richard's children.  Without a male heir, Downton Abbey will go to another branch of the family.  In both programs:  (1) family members die (or appear to die) on the Titanic, (2) the young men are involved in World War I (in each, the principal young male character, after being missing in action, returns home gravely wounded; in each household, one of the domestic servants suffers from shell shock); (3) a young female member of the family becomes a wartime nurse; (4) a young woman dies from influenza; (5) there is a downstairs romance; (6) there is a homosexual footman; (6) a male aristocrat refuses to take responsibility for a child he has fathered by a maid; (7) an adventurous young daughter gets into trouble from her involvement in the suffrage movement; (8) the cook is courted by an unworthy suitor; (9) the question arises as to who will fill in for the ailing butler; (10) the household feels obliged to dismiss an unsatisfactory nanny; and (11) the family suffers from making bad investments.  Well, you get the idea.This 21-disc set provides several supplementary features.  (1) The production of each Series is documented in an accompanying program, featuring interviews with writers, directors, actors.  (2) ""Russell Harty Goes Upstairs, Downstairs"" (1975), in which talk show host Russell Harty visits cast members on the set shortly after the final episode was broadcast.  (3) ""Upstairs Downstairs Remembered"" (1996), narrated by Gareth Hunt, in which cast members give accounts of behind-the-scenes problems and accomplishments.  (4)  In ""Sandy's Last Stand"" (2006), composer Alexander Faris describes how he wrote the theme music, including the ""upstairs"" theme and the ""downstairs"" theme (""What are We Going to Do With Uncle Arthur?"").  This includes performances of both the original 4/4 and the more familiar 3/4 versions of the upstairs theme, and the downstairs theme.Upstairs Downstairs was the product of 9 writers and 8 directors.  Hence, there are some inconsistencies in the details and in the portrayal of characters.  There are relatively few scene changes; and the program often has the feel of a stage production.  Images of many outdoor scenes, which were filmed with smaller cameras, have noticeably lower resolution.  The 2010 Acorn release, on which this review is based, is said to be better than the previous A & E versions.  But, like some other reviewers, I have experienced a few problems with it.  Several episodes freeze.  I have not had similar problems with other Acorn products. [See NOTE below.] A list of all 68 episodes, indicating the discs on which they were reproduced, would have been a very desirable addition to this set.  I have compiled such a list and attached a copy inside the jewel case for each series; this enables me to go directly to the appropriate disc for whatever episode I wish to see.By informal count, Upstairs Downstairs was nominated for 17 Emmys and received 7, most significantly, 4 successive awards for outstanding dramatic series.  It was nominated for 9 BAFTA awards and received 2; and was nominated for 4 Golden Globe Awards and received 1.  It also received a Peabody Award, a Royal Television Society Award; and its theme song won the Ivor Novello Award for Best Theme From a Radio or Television Production.  The program could have continued beyond five years, but the actors, writers, and directors chose to end it.  Cyril Bennett, who had been reluctant to air the program in the first place, pleaded vociferously, but ineffectively, with John Hawkesworth that the program should be  extended  for another ten years.  Thus, there have been no further episodes of this outstanding drama.Christopher Hodson, who directed 14 episodes, described U/D as ""the sort of series that doesn't come along more than once in a lifetime.""  Few would disagree.[NOTE:  The sticking problem seems to result from a spindle hole that is slightly too small.  Enlarging the spindle hole by as little as .001 of an inch with the aid of a round mini-file or fine sandpaper seems to correct the problem. Perhaps some other reviewer can explain why this is so.  Needless to say, be careful not to damage any other surfaces of a CD! ]",5,One of the Best Dramas of All Time,1381363200,"10 10, 2013",2013,11605,"['One', 'greatest', 'dramatic', 'series', 'time',
