994534,A1NZ3OBRUF13FA,B000FS2W26,"Fred Burroughs ""Ladies and gentlemen, Fred Bu...","[1, 1]","I had the original Anchor Bay DVDs of the entire series and discovered that, while the sound and picture quality were fine (actually it might be some of the most detailed looking SD DVD I had), and there were good extras, they were the edited episodes for syndication that had some of the little extra gags (often scene-enders) here and there missing (in spite of saying ""uncut"" on the cover).  So I was OVERJOYED to see that Mill Creek Entertainment was releasing seasons 1 and 2 uncut on DVD with the same extras.  The only downside was the crappy packaging (paper slip covers for the discs) and degraded picture quality due to the higher level of compression (up to eight episodes a disc).So imagine my disappointment when I found out that the later seasons released by Mill Creek were the same, edited episodes as from Anchor Bay, making the upgrade pointless.  Jokes and small scenes that I remember from first broadcast are missing.  Why didn't Mill Creek release the entire, uncut seasons 3-6?  If they didn't have the rights, us 3rd Rockers would have gladly waited for the full versions.  So why the rush to release?That said, the actual show is dynamite and you aren't missing anything plot-centric by watching the syndication episodes.  I consider 3rd Rock to be America's best sitcom (not coincidentally it is the most British-like American sitcom), though sometimes I can't make my mind up between this, Seinfeld, and The Simpsons when it was at its peak (seasons 3-7).  The comedy comes from wit, wordplay, buffoonery, slapstick, grown people acting like children and cartoon characters, and despite superficially seeming to be a mindless Vaudevillian/Commedia Della Arte exercise, it was actually the smartest show on the air when it was on.  Fans of Scrubs, Community, or Malcolm in the Middle (which shared many of the writers and plots, in fact Hal is almost a nice version of Dick) will enjoy 3rd Rock.",5,"Best American Sitcom, But Edited DVDs!",1369008000,"05 20, 2013",2013,1921,"['had', 'original', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'DVDs', 'entire', 'series', 'discovered', 'sound', 'picture', 'quality', 'were', 'fine', 'actually', 'might', 'be', 'most', 'detailed', 'looking', 'SD', 'DVD', 'had', 'were', 'good', 'extras', 'were', 'edited', 'episodes', 'syndication', 'had', 'little', 'extra', 'gags', 'often', 'scene-enders', 'here', 'there', 'missing', 'spite', 'saying', 'uncut', 'cover', 'was', 'OVERJOYED', 'see', 'Mill', 'Creek', 'Entertainment', 'was', 'releasing', 'seasons', '1', '2', 'uncut', 'DVD', 'same', 'extras', 'only', 'downside', 'was', 'crappy', 'packaging', 'paper', 'slip', 'discs', 'degraded', 'picture', 'quality', 'due', 'higher', 'level', 'compression', 'eight', 'episodes', 'disc', '.So', 'imagine', 'disappointment', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'later', 'seasons', 'released', 'Mill', 'Creek', 'were', 'same', 'edited', 'episodes', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'making', 'upgrade', 'pointless', 'Jokes', 'small', 'scenes', 'remember', 'first', 'broadcast', 'are', 'missing', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'Mill', 'Creek', 'release', 'entire', 'uncut', 'seasons', '3-6', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'rights', '3rd', 'Rockers', 'would', 'have', 'gladly', 'waited', 'full', 'versions', 'So', 'why', 'rush', 'release', 'said', 'actual', 'show', 'dynamite', 'are', ""n't"", 'missing', 'anything', 'plot-centric', 'watching', 'syndication', 'consider', '3rd', 'Rock', 'be', 'America', 'best', 'sitcom', 'not', 'coincidentally', 'most', 'British-like', 'American', 'sitcom', 'sometimes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'mind', 'up', 'Seinfeld', 'Simpsons', 'when', 'was', 'peak', 'seasons', '3-7', 'comedy', 'wit', 'wordplay', 'buffoonery', 'slapstick', 'grown', 'people', 'acting', 'children', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'superficially', 'seeming', 'be', 'mindless', 'Vaudevillian/Commedia', 'Della', 'Arte', 'exercise', 'was', 'actually', 'smartest', 'show', 'air', 'when', 'was', 'Fans', 'Scrubs', 'Community', 'Malcolm', 'Middle', 'shared', 'many', 'writers', 'plots', 'fact', 'Hal', 'almost', 'nice', 'version', 'Dick', 'will', 'enjoy', '3rd', 'Rock']",N/A

Season Five lacked the girth and substance the preceding seasons seemed to fling about with glee.  It is almost as though they KNEW things were coming to an end.  A few episodes brought out a hearty chuckle, but hardly any show this season captured my love for the characters.  The season was surprisingly lacking in any real character growth or development.  And that really starts to make one's attention wane after FIVE SEASONS.*  Dick and Mary move no further in their relationship.*  Harry and Vicki plod along with their bizarre lovemaking and &#34;fly by night&#34; relationship.*  Sally and Don trudge along with no real development.*  Tommy and Alissa surprisingly don't last (read: sarcasm), though previous seasons showed Tommy to be the only real growing authority on what it is to be &#34;human&#34;. As his character is an old man trapped in (given the gift of??) a young man's body, it makes sense that his monogamy is faltering and his efforts are sexually-driven.  Stilll...I was disappointed to see such lack of character development.  In any comedy, a solid serious character out of the core group can do a lot for leveling comedy to drama.  Mary acts as &#34;reason&#34; to the other four characters' &#34;rash&#34;, but even she doesn't hold the fort too well.  Tommy's character waxed between reason and crazed well, but the show seems to lose focus on the fact that tubular, purple aliens are donning human form to learn more about Earth characters, and failing miserably.In fairness, I haven't watched the season more than once all the way through.  A few episodes held my attention for a second watch.  So a thorough understanding of the nuances is remiss on my side.The show is a worthwhile purchase.  And the season has it's merits.

Gabriel ""tegabriel""","[35, 38]","In case you haven't noticed, Seasons 1 and 2 were reissued by Mill Creek Entertainment in alternate packaging several months ago, and seasons 3 & 4 were reissued in April 2012. These reissues are at a much lower price than those original-issue products offered in the after-market. Save yourself some money and WAIT for seasons 5 & 6.I noticed that Amazon is offering a $40 gift card for the original issue version. If I had one, I'd sell it to Amazon and buy the reissue next year.UpdateIn case you've come to the page for the original issue version of Season 5, you'll want to scroll up to the 'other formats & versions' section and click the link in the Amazon Price column. Pre-order the reissue for under $10!Another updateThe theme music changed.
