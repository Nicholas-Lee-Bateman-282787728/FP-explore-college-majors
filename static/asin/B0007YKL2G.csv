895218,A1EEMMDBA6ZSI4,B0007YKL2G,Alexander,"[2, 2]","'Brian Wilson Presents SMiLE' is a wonderful companion to have along with the 'SMiLE' album itself. The DVD package contains two discs. Disc one contains the feature length documentary 'Beautiful Dreamer' and disc two contains the live concert of SMiLE.'Beautiful Dreamer' is an amazing documentary. The movie does a great job of detailing Brian's life during the SMiLE era. It gives great insight into all the work that went into the project (both in the 60s and in 2004). It features interviews with Brian's friends/family, fellow musicians, fellow lyricists. The movie is full of footage and pictures from the early Beach Boy days. The documentary does not go into great detail about certain issues (it doesn't even mention Brian's relations with Gene Landy)...However, I can understand this because the movie is basically about the 'SMiLE' album (it is not a documentary on Brian's entire life).The live concert of 'SMiLE' is wonderful. The audio quality is excellent and the video quality is top notch. ...between the lights/projections, on-stage theatrics, and the camera work, the concert was very fun to watch.The DVD package is quite pricey, but definitely worth it.5/5",5,Beautiful SMiLE...,1264204800,"01 23, 2010",2010,1178,"[""'Brian"", 'Wilson', 'Presents', 'SMiLE', 'wonderful', 'companion', 'have', 'along', ""'SMiLE"", 'album', 'DVD', 'package', 'two', 'discs', 'Disc', 'one', 'feature', 'length', 'documentary', ""'Beautiful"", 'Dreamer', 'disc', 'two', 'live', 'concert', 'SMiLE', ""'Beautiful"", 'Dreamer', 'amazing', 'documentary', 'movie', 'great', 'job', 'detailing', 'Brian', 'life', 'SMiLE', 'era', 'great', 'insight', 'work', 'went', 'project', '60s', '2004', 'interviews', 'Brian', 'friends/family', 'fellow', 'musicians', 'fellow', 'lyricists', 'movie', 'full', 'footage', 'pictures', 'early', 'Beach', 'Boy', 'days', 'documentary', 'not', 'go', 'great', 'detail', 'certain', 'issues', ""n't"", 'even', 'mention', 'Brian', 'relations', 'Gene', 'Landy', 'However', 'can', 'understand', 'movie', 'basically', ""'SMiLE"", 'album', 'not', 'documentary', 'Brian', 'entire', 'life', '.The', 'live', 'concert', ""'SMiLE"", 'wonderful', 'audio', 'quality', 'excellent', 'video', 'quality', 'top', 'notch', 'lights/projections', 'on-stage', 'theatrics', 'camera', 'work', 'concert', 'was', 'very', 'fun', 'watch.The', 'DVD', 'package', 'quite', 'pricey', 'definitely', 'worth', 'it.5/5']",N/A

This DVD alsoincludes the Beautiful Dreamer documentary. It is all about the creation and makingof SMiLE. It is a must see. The genius of Brian Wilson is never over-estimated.My favorite parts are ""Heroes and Villains"" and ""Wonderful."" For me thereis no song that is better than ""Wonderful.""

""Beautiful Dreamer,"" the feature-length documentary, is a sad but ultimately fascinating look at Brian's journey back to SMiLE. The narrative is obviously pro-Brian and tends to be anti-Beach Boys, which is understandable given the band's reluctance to take a risk in releasing SMiLE back in the 60's, however not enough emphasis is given for example to Dennis's support for the album or the fact that ultimately the band used several SMiLE-era songs on later Beach Boy albums. Mike Love does not come off very well in this, which isn't very surprising. Even though this is was made clearly by Brian's friends and admirers, it does not spare in its honesty showing Brian at one point clearly not interested in his band's rehearsals of the SMiLE music and their subsequent worry that he wasn't up to the task.Thankfully, he was up to the task, rose to the occasion, and was able to conquer his demons.

895222,A235NA61RC6YC1,B0007YKL2G,George Dionne,"[9, 10]","The GoodDisc 1: Beautiful Dreamer: Brian Wilson and the Story of SmileThe first disc is a two hour documentary on Brian's beginnings, his success with the Beach Boys, his agonies with Smile, and his triumph return. It's chock-full of information and insight. One thing I didn't know is that Brian Wilson is deaf in one ear. As Brian tells his story we find out that his father was very controlling and abused his children. Brian was inspired to write music by George Gershwin's ""Rhapsody in Blue"". Wilson had to fire his father as manager and do everything himself at a young age. It was a bad LSD trip that inspired him to write ""California Girls"". The Beach Boys constantly fought with him over the ever-changing sound that he created for them.While composing the music for Smile, Brian set his piano in a sandbox. He also set up an Arabian tent for inspiration. He used it until he realized how hot it was inside. Smile was originally set for release in January of 1967. It was shelved because of Brian's frustrations with the Beach Boys adapting and accepting the music and pressures from the record company. Smile is a concept album that depicts a bicycle trip from Plymouth, Massachusetts to Hawaii (I know, how do you get to Hawaii on a bike?).It wasn't until Brian got married in the nineties that he got the psychological help that he need as a result of a nervous breakdown he suffered in the sixties (there's more to it than that). His wife inspires him to perform live again and revisit Smile. It all culminates with a historic concert in England 2004. Don't worry, there's plenty more-I didn't ruin it for you. Bonus materials included on this disc are a theatrical trailer, highlights from the show in England, an after-show featurette, and interview highlights.Disc 2: Smile Live PerformanceThe second disc features a liver performance that was recorded in Los Angeles, California. Brian Wilson appears center stage seated behind a keyboard. He is backed-up by a 15+ member band that included a string section, back-up singers, percussionists, and more. The show begins with the spiritual, hymn-like ""Our Prayer/Gee"". The albums centerpiece ""Heroes and Villains"" shows that Wilson's signature sound is still intact. ""Roll Plymouth Rock"" has great vocal harmonies and catchy keyboard work. ""Barnyard"" is quite playful as everyone is assigned an animal noise. With its banjo and harmonica accents, ""Cabin Essence"" makes you feel like you're sailing down a river bank.Wilson continues to show his playful side with the healthy eating promotion of ""Vega-Tables"". A carnival atmosphere is set with ""On Holiday"". On ""Mrs. O'Leary's Cow"", the string section, keyboards, slide whistles, and kazoos combine to create the panic that a fire causes. Do you need me to talk about ""Good Vibrations""? Bonus materials included on this disc include outtakes from the documentary, a Brian Wilson photo gallery, Brian Wilson at the piano (which includes brief performances), a recording of featurette, and a video for ""Heroes and Villains"" that was arraigned by a contest winner.The BadBrian Wilson sat behind a keyboard throughout the whole live performance, but I'll be damned if he played one note.The VerdictI was skeptical going into the live performance of the DVD. I've heard time and time again that in recent years that Brian Wilson just doesn't perform well in a live setting. That's why I was shocked when so many reviewers put Smile on their Best of the Year lists. I avoided it. That was a mistake! This particular performance is spectacular, inspiring, and fun. Brian brings along so many great musicians to help capture the unique and complex sound of Smile. The outcome is flawless.",5,"This performance is spectacular, inspiring, and fun.",1119312000,"06 21, 2005",2005,3694,"['GoodDisc', '1', 'Beautiful', 'Dreamer', 'Brian', 'Wilson', 'Story', 'SmileThe', 'first', 'disc', 'two', 'hour', 'documentary', 'Brian', 'beginnings', 'success', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'agonies', 'Smile', 'triumph', 'return', 'chock-full', 'information', 'insight', 'One', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'Brian', 'Wilson', 'deaf', 'one', 'ear', 'Brian', 'story', 'find', 'out', 'father', 'was', 'very', 'controlling', 'abused', 'children', 'Brian', 'was', 'inspired', 'write', 'music', 'George', 'Gershwin', 'Rhapsody', 'Blue', 'Wilson', 'had', 'fire', 'father', 'manager', 'do', 'everything', 'young', 'age', 'was', 'bad', 'LSD', 'trip', 'inspired', 'write', 'California', 'Girls', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'constantly', 'fought', 'ever-changing', 'sound', 'created', 'them.While', 'composing', 'music', 'Smile', 'Brian', 'set', 'piano', 'sandbox', 'also', 'set', 'up', 'Arabian', 'tent', 'inspiration', 'used', 'realized', 'how', 'hot', 'was', 'inside', 'Smile', 'was', 'originally', 'set', 'release', 'January', '1967', 'was', 'shelved', 'Brian', 'frustrations', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'adapting', 'accepting', 'music', 'pressures', 'record', 'company', 'Smile', 'concept', 'album', 'bicycle', 'trip', 'Plymouth', 'Massachusetts', 'Hawaii', 'know', 'how', 'do', 'get', 'Hawaii', 'bike', '.It', 'was', ""n't"", 'Brian', 'got', 'married', 'nineties', 'got', 'psychological', 'help', 'need', 'result', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'suffered', 'sixties', 'more', 'wife', 'perform', 'live', 'again', 'revisit', 'Smile', 'historic', 'concert', 'England', '2004', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'plenty', 'more-I', 'did', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'materials', 'included', 'disc', 'are', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'highlights', 'show', 'England', 'after-show', 'featurette', 'interview', 'highlights.Disc', '2', 'Smile', 'Live', 'PerformanceThe', 'second', 'disc', 'liver', 'performance', 'was', 'recorded', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'California', 'Brian', 'Wilson', 'center', 'stage', 'seated', 'keyboard', 'backed-up', '15+', 'member', 'band', 'included', 'string', 'section', 'back-up', 'singers', 'percussionists', 'more', 'show', 'spiritual', 'hymn-like', 'Prayer/Gee', 'albums', 'centerpiece', 'Heroes', 'Villains', 'Wilson', 'signature', 'sound', 'still', 'intact', 'Roll', 'Plymouth', 'Rock', 'great', 'vocal', 'harmonies', 'catchy', 'keyboard', 'work', 'Barnyard', 'quite', 'playful', 'everyone', 'assigned', 'animal', 'noise', 'banjo', 'harmonica', 'accents', 'Cabin', 'Essence', 'feel', ""'re"", 'sailing', 'down', 'river', 'bank.Wilson', 'show', 'playful', 'side', 'healthy', 'eating', 'promotion', 'Vega-Tables', 'carnival', 'atmosphere', 'set', 'Holiday', 'Mrs.', ""O'Leary"", 'Cow', 'string', 'section', 'keyboards', 'slide', 'whistles', 'kazoos', 'combine', 'create', 'panic', 'fire', 'Do', 'need', 'talk', 'Good', 'Vibrations', 'Bonus', 'materials', 'included', 'disc', 'include', 'outtakes', 'documentary', 'Brian', 'Wilson', 'photo', 'gallery', 'Brian', 'Wilson', 'piano', 'brief', 'performances', 'recording', 'featurette', 'video', 'Heroes', 'Villains', 'was', 'arraigned', 'contest', 'winner.The', 'BadBrian', 'Wilson', 'sat', 'keyboard', 'whole', 'live', 'performance', ""'ll"", 'be', 'damned', 'played', 'one', 'note.The', 'VerdictI', 'was', 'skeptical', 'going', 'live', 'performance', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'recent', 'years', 'Brian', 'Wilson', 'just', ""n't"", 'perform', 'well', 'live', 'setting', 'why', 'was', 'shocked', 'when', 'so', 'many', 'reviewers', 'put', 'Smile', 'Best', 'Year', 'avoided', 'was', 'mistake', 'particular', 'performance', 'spectacular', 'inspiring', 'fun', 'Brian', 'brings', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'musicians', 'help', 'capture', 'unique', 'complex', 'sound', 'Smile', 'outcome', 'flawless']",N/A
895223,ANIMV3SPDD8SH,B0007YKL2G,Guy De Federicis,"[3, 3]","Comprehensive 2 DVD package chronicling the arrival in 2004 of Beach Boys' Brian Wilson's ""Smile"" album, that legendary hushed secret rumored to be as grand as ""Sgt. Pepper"", uncerimoniously leaked over the years in bootleg recordings, and finally laid to rest as an impossible dream, a rock and roll fantasy on a par with a complete Beatles reunion. In 1967 the world grooved to Beach Boys' classic, ""Good Vibrations"", but the album which it heralded never arrived, abandoned by Wilson after costing him a chunk of mental well-being, as he found himself in artistic arrest, unable to iron out what he felt were imperfections to his masterpiece. He stuffed his production on a shelf somewhere and strolled away, from the album, and indeed from life. It only took therapy, a supportive new wife, and maybe a kilo of anti-depressants to lure Wilson from self exile and complete the album, 37 years after the fact. This DVD package, a documentary leading up to and including the unveiling of the complete ""Smile"" performed in London in 2004, and the complete album itself performed in Surfin' City USA, L.A., is a Beach Boys lovers wet California dream come true. The reclusive Wilson is seen like a fish reentering water, enthusiastically speaking of the history of ""Smile"", (Did anybody care after 37 years?), and his life and career; he tells of a young Beach Boys earliest recordings gaining popularity as they repeatedly called a local radio station requesting their record. He is unassuming and confident, fragile and artistically obsessed, indeed taking ""Smile"" back into the recording studio cost him at least one more hospital visit, which was abruptly ended when his wife asked nonchalantly if he'd rather go out for dinner. He's keenly aware, and befuddled by the awe he inspires in his peers, and becomes frustrated with the reproduction of the album, expressing temperament, (and love), with studio musicians, and is totally unimpressed when Paul McCartney and other rock royalty visits him backstage just before the premier of ""Smile"". The only thing missing here, and it seemed vital with everyone and their brother offering insight into Wilson, is the surviving Beach Boys', (Mike Love), input on the reemergence of ""Smile"". Maybe they chose not to indulge, and if so, it was a grave error not to be in support of this historical footnote. Lest I forget the thing itself, the album ""Smile"" is wonderful, with lyrics by Van Dyke Parks, music by Brian Wilson, it is a resounding last surfer wave banging against the beach, a celebration of American pop music and it's attempt to lead the masses into a brighter tomorrow. But it is not so much the album that inspires and warms the heart, which it certainly does. It is the fact that Wilson finally delivered ""Smile"" to the music world and his fans, when all hope was long dashed.",4,GOOD VIBRATIONS,1177459200,"04 25, 2007",2007,2840,"['Comprehensive', '2', 'DVD', 'package', 'chronicling', 'arrival', '2004', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'Brian', 'Wilson', 'Smile', 'album', 'legendary', 'hushed', 'secret', 'rumored', 'be', 'as', 'grand', 'Sgt', 'Pepper', 'uncerimoniously', 'leaked', 'years', 'bootleg', 'recordings', 'finally', 'laid', 'rest', 'impossible', 'dream', 'rock', 'roll', 'fantasy', 'par', 'complete', 'Beatles', 'reunion', '1967', 'world', 'grooved', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'classic', 'Good', 'Vibrations', 'album', 'heralded', 'never', 'arrived', 'abandoned', 'Wilson', 'costing', 'chunk', 'mental', 'well-being', 'found', 'artistic', 'arrest', 'unable', 'iron', 'out', 'what', 'felt', 'were', 'imperfections', 'masterpiece', 'stuffed', 'production', 'shelf', 'somewhere', 'strolled', 'away', 'album', 'indeed', 'life', 'only', 'took', 'therapy', 'supportive', 'new', 'wife', 'maybe', 'kilo', 'anti-depressants', 'lure', 'Wilson', 'self', 'exile', 'complete', 'album', '37', 'years', 'fact', 'DVD', 'package', 'documentary', 'leading', 'up', 'including', 'unveiling', 'complete', 'Smile', 'performed', 'London', '2004', 'complete', 'album', 'performed', 'Surfin', 'City', 'USA', 'L.A.', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'lovers', 'wet', 'California', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'reclusive', 'Wilson', 'seen', 'fish', 'reentering', 'water', 'enthusiastically', 'speaking', 'history', 'Smile', 'Did', 'anybody', 'care', '37', 'years', 'life', 'career', 'young', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'earliest', 'recordings', 'gaining', 'popularity', 'repeatedly', 'called', 'local', 'radio', 'station', 'requesting', 'record', 'unassuming', 'confident', 'fragile', 'artistically', 'obsessed', 'indeed', 'taking', 'Smile', 'back', 'recording', 'studio', 'cost', 'least', 'one', 'more', 'hospital', 'visit', 'was', 'abruptly', 'ended', 'when', 'wife', 'asked', 'nonchalantly', ""'d"", 'rather', 'go', 'out', 'dinner', 'keenly', 'aware', 'befuddled', 'awe', 'peers', 'becomes', 'frustrated', 'reproduction', 'album', 'expressing', 'temperament', 'love', 'studio', 'musicians', 'totally', 'unimpressed', 'when', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'other', 'rock', 'royalty', 'backstage', 'just', 'premier', 'Smile', 'only', 'thing', 'missing', 'here', 'seemed', 'vital', 'everyone', 'brother', 'offering', 'insight', 'Wilson', 'surviving', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'Mike', 'Love', 'input', 'reemergence', 'Smile', 'Maybe', 'chose', 'not', 'indulge', 'so', 'was', 'grave', 'error', 'not', 'be', 'support', 'historical', 'footnote', 'Lest', 'forget', 'thing', 'album', 'Smile', 'wonderful', 'lyrics', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'Parks', 'music', 'Brian', 'Wilson', 'resounding', 'last', 'surfer', 'wave', 'banging', 'beach', 'celebration', 'American', 'pop', 'music', 'attempt', 'lead', 'masses', 'brighter', 'tomorrow', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'album', 'heart', 'certainly', 'fact', 'Wilson', 'finally', 'delivered', 'Smile', 'music', 'world', 'fans', 'when', 'hope', 'was', 'long', 'dashed']",N/A

I caught that too, but then the focus of the documentary was the completion of the ""Smile"" album 37 years after it was supposed to have been completed.  I don't think the documentary was supposed to be a detailed biography of Brian Wilson.The documentary itself might have been called ""Heroes and Villians"".  The ""villians"" being the record company and the other Beach Boys who supposedly were responsible for the scrapping of the original Smile project, and the ""heroes"" being the next generation of musicians who embraced the idea of completing Smile and of helping Brian Wilson summon the courage to face his past and overcome it.

895228,A2058UZR5TU9GY,B0007YKL2G,"LJP ""LJP""","[4, 4]","The first disc is the story of finishing SMILE.  It begins with a good background of the early days of the Beach Boys and why Brian stopped touring to concentrate on writing and producing for the band.  What to this day blows me away is how much responsibility he shouldered at such a young age.  There may have been five Beach Boys, he may have had some help with writing some of the songs, but essentially there was no band without Brian.  His creativity matured at a much faster pace than the rest of the boys, too fast.  Add an over-bearing dad who was incompetent as manager, you understand why he had a nervous breakdown.The resurfacing of the SMILE project takes over the rest of disc one, understandably so.  And the rest of the disc is great, especially when SMILE debuts in London.  Taking into account everything Brian Wilson went through for close to 40 years, it's hard to believe he would choose to debut SMILE on such a large, world stage, but he did.  And probably the most incredible thing of all is not that the debut of SMILE was successful, but that it was such a complete triumph.  And he pretty much took that in stride, which also blew me away.  My wife watched this with me, and although not a fan of the Beach Boys, was really caught up in Brian's story and enjoyed it a lot.Disc 2 is the SMILE concert, not the London debut, though.  I wish it was, but I'm not complaining. Great concert, and when it's done, you just have to wonder what kind of reception it would have received back in 1966-67 when he was trying to put it together and the band was resisting him.  I would imagine SMILE would have been mentioned in the same breath as Sgt. Pepper and the Beach Boys may have rivaled the Beatles for a few more years rather than what really happened.I'd pay the money for the first disc alone.

Put on a pair of earphones and listen.Alright this is about the DVD not the album itself.

It is essential viewing for Brian Wilson fans and casual/non fans should check it out too.Disc 2 is a live performance of ""SMiLE."" I may like the studio version better but that's not saying that I don't like the live version. Modern bands should watch this and weep. Brian Wilson has assembled the greatest band in the world. To watch them pull this off in a live setting is quite something to behold.The DVD also has some interesting extras, including a performance of ""Mrs. O'Leary's Cow"" from the world premiere in London. As well as bonus interviews, after show thoughts and solo piano performances from Brian himself.But the one that tops them all is the making of ""SMiLE"" featurette.

The first disc is a documentary on the whole Smile project- starting with a brief history of Brian through the early days of the Beach Boys.  It shows the genesis of the original Smile album that never was, starting with the completion of Pet Sounds, and includes a lot of insight and interviews with the key people involved in the project.  This is no Beach Boys story, clearly showing who was the brains, talent, and leader of the band up until this project's abandonment (""Mike didn't like it"").  It then fast forwards 37 years and shows how, and why, Brian resurrected it, ending with the world premiere in England.  It's a triumphant ending, with Brian finally clearing a hurdle that everyone, including himself, never thought he would.  This is not only fascinating for Smile fans, but also for anyone who doesn't think they are, as it will most likely make you more interested in, and more appreciative of, this project.The Second disc is a live performance of ""SMiLE"".  This appeals to everyone as well: those who have the CD, but did not see him live on this tour, those that are unfamiliar with Smile at all, and those that have the CD, and saw the show, and simply want a souvenir of that experience.I can't help but wonder after watching both discs just how different our musical scene, and Brian, would have been had this project been completed in 1967.  Maybe if Mike Love would watch it he'd finally see how wrong he was, and is, and stop acting like a pompous egomaniacal know-it-all.Sorry, just had to stick my two cents in on that.

895231,A1AWJUDQU6JXGU,B0007YKL2G,Music maven,"[3, 3]","The concert disc in this set may is easily the best music DVD I've seen. The recording is absolutely pristine, to the point where I found myself beginning to question whether the sounds I was hearing were actually a live recording. The musicianship is superlative--the Wondermints form the core of the band, which makes that a given--and the performance spotless. And the camerawork and lighting are all tasteful, well edited, and integrated with the music (I can't tell you how many music DVDs I've seen where the camera is squarely fixed on the person who isn't soloing at the time, or quick-cut for style instead of following the musical line). And, of course, the music itself is extraordinary.The documentary disc is very interesting despite itself. It's intended to be a paean to Brian Wilson, so it sugar coats a lot of things, is generally superficial, and uses overblown language in the narration. Most disappointingly, it glosses over his mental illness--the single most significant thing in the story of Smile. To the extent that it's mentioned at all, it is referred to as depression, with the vocal emphasis indicating quotation marks around the word, and it's always qualified as being the product of circumstances--he was sad because the band didn't like the music, he was worried that the public wouldn't understand it. That's ridiculous, of course. He says at one point he's hearing voices (put down, typically, to his acid use), and the film describes his having meetings in the middle of his swimming pool because it was the one place he felt wasn't bugged. So there's at least clinical paranoia and schizophrenia going on in there, and I suspect much more. It's unfortunate, because a fuller and more frank discussion of his illness would make him more sympathetic and the story of the resurrection of Smile all the more potent. But the film succeeds despite this because during the footage of rehearsals for the modern Smile, we can clearly see the demons running riot in his head. During the early rehearsals he's almost catatonic, and the band has to take over. (It would be hard to say enough about how loving and supportive this band is, particularly Darian. They are a way the real stars of the film.) It's remarkable to watch him slowly come to life as the rehearsals continue and he sinks into the music, but then, as the premiere approaches, he becomes more and more fearful and disturbed--you can almost hear the demons raging in there as he sits backstage waiting to go on. This is perhaps all the more powerful because the film has gone to such lengths to downplay it, making it seem more like a secret and thus giving it implicit importance. And when he finally does go out and perform, it is one of the most remarkable acts of courage I've ever seen. The band is rough here, much more so than in the later concert on disc 2, but the audience, rightly, erupts with passion. You know they're applauding not just for the music, though it certainly deserves it, but for the courage that Brian displays. I only wish the filmmakers had had as much courage in talking about his problems.With that minor caveat, this is a magnificent package and a unique piece of history.",5,A masterpiece,1190505600,"09 23, 2007",2007,3198,"['concert', 'disc', 'set', 'may', 'easily', 'best', 'music', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recording', 'absolutely', 'pristine', 'point', 'where', 'found', 'beginning', 'question', 'sounds', 'was', 'hearing', 'were', 'actually', 'live', 'recording', 'musicianship', 'superlative', 'Wondermints', 'form', 'core', 'band', 'given', 'performance', 'spotless', 'camerawork', 'lighting', 'are', 'tasteful', 'well', 'edited', 'integrated', 'music', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'how', 'many', 'music', 'DVDs', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'where', 'camera', 'squarely', 'fixed', 'person', 'who', ""n't"", 'soloing', 'time', 'quick-cut', 'style', 'instead', 'following', 'musical', 'line', 'course', 'music', 'extraordinary.The', 'documentary', 'disc', 'very', 'interesting', 'intended', 'be', 'paean', 'Brian', 'Wilson', 'lot', 'things', 'generally', 'superficial', 'overblown', 'language', 'narration', 'Most', 'disappointingly', 'mental', 'illness', 'single', 'most', 'significant', 'thing', 'story', 'Smile', 'extent', 'mentioned', 'referred', 'depression', 'vocal', 'emphasis', 'indicating', 'quotation', 'marks', 'word', 'always', 'qualified', 'being', 'product', 'circumstances', 'was', 'sad', 'band', 'did', ""n't"", 'music', 'was', 'worried', 'public', 'would', ""n't"", 'understand', 'ridiculous', 'course', 'one', 'point', 'hearing', 'voices', 'put', 'down', 'typically', 'acid', 'use', 'film', 'having', 'meetings', 'middle', 'swimming', 'pool', 'was', 'one', 'place', 'felt', 'was', ""n't"", 'bugged', 'least', 'clinical', 'paranoia', 'schizophrenia', 'going', 'suspect', 'much', 'more', 'unfortunate', 'fuller', 'more', 'frank', 'discussion', 'illness', 'would', 'make', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'story', 'resurrection', 'Smile', 'more', 'potent', 'film', 'footage', 'rehearsals', 'modern', 'Smile', 'can', 'clearly', 'see', 'demons', 'running', 'riot', 'head', 'early', 'rehearsals', 'almost', 'catatonic', 'band', 'take', 'over', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'say', 'enough', 'how', 'loving', 'supportive', 'band', 'particularly', 'Darian', 'are', 'way', 'real', 'stars', 'film', 'remarkable', 'watch', 'slowly', 'come', 'life', 'rehearsals', 'continue', 'music', 'then', 'premiere', 'approaches', 'more', 'more', 'fearful', 'disturbed', 'can', 'almost', 'hear', 'demons', 'raging', 'there', 'backstage', 'waiting', 'go', 'perhaps', 'more', 'powerful', 'film', 'gone', 'such', 'lengths', 'downplay', 'making', 'seem', 'more', 'secret', 'thus', 'giving', 'implicit', 'importance', 'when', 'finally', 'go', 'out', 'perform', 'one', 'most', 'remarkable', 'acts', 'courage', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'band', 'rough', 'here', 'much', 'more', 'so', 'later', 'concert', 'disc', '2', 'audience', 'rightly', 'erupts', 'passion', 'know', ""'re"", 'applauding', 'not', 'just', 'music', 'certainly', 'courage', 'Brian', 'only', 'wish', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'had', 'much', 'courage', 'talking', 'problems.With', 'minor', 'caveat', 'magnificent', 'package', 'unique', 'piece', 'history']",N/A

Disc 1 is worth the price of this whole dvd set alone. A facinating look into a geniuses mind,from Brians humble beginnings through The Beach Boys years, to Brians out of public life existance, to the Smile 2004 tour. This documentary is a very facinating and candid look that informed me about things about Brian I was unsure of. Brian Wilson it is safe to say was the brightest candle in the rock music business lot, that is why he burned out the quickest. His genius was so ""grand and majestic that Brian was clearly overwhelmed by his endless and broad musical creativity throughout the 1960s. Clearly watching this documentary I really see how far ahead Brian Wilson was ahead of the Beatles. Were it not for his drug indulgences and psychiatric problems, nervous breakdowns, strife from Other Beach Boys Members, Smileys Smile"" (1967)could have stole the show from The Beatles ""Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band"". There are plenty of interveiws on this documentary that shed light on Brian during his most creative period. Dvd 2--The concert is a watch of a genius, disecting his work as Brian really rebuilt ""Smile"" from the dreadful ""Smileys Smile"" sessions(1966-1967) that had strife and conflict from the other Beach Boys. Brians band ""The Wondermints"" show great enthusiasum and care for Brians style of music as their performance is enlightingly beautiful. The finished result of ""Smile"" is incredible and a voyage inside a geniuses mind. I really feel Brian was such a musical genius that he was really on the edge of insanity throughout his whole life, the drugs, the nervous breakdowns and his isolation for many years served as an outlet to vent his near insanity and genius.

Worth the price of admission for this alone.- some fascinating behind-the-scenes footage shot during the CD recording sessions.- some revealing and often moving sequences shot during the process leading up to the debut performance of SMiLE in London in 2004 (contained in the ""Beautiful Dreamer"" documentary).Do not buy this DVD for:- the true story of why the Beach Boys' original ""Smile"" was never finished, and why Brian Wilson essentially disappeared for the next 25 years.""Beautiful Dreamer"" is an interesting addition to the ever-growing list of books and documentaries about Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys, but it shouldn't be your only source if you're looking for a balanced view.Produced by and largely populated by current Wilson insiders, ""Beautiful Dreamer"" tries very hard to whitewash the story that's been told and re-told by many others who were there at the time. Dismissing any discussion of the destructive power of drugs (drug use only served to expand Brian's consciousness and make him more productive, we're told) or of any form of mental illness other than ""undiagnosed depression,"" the film lays the blame for the abandonment of ""Smile"" at the feet of... the other Beach Boys. Apparently it was their rejection of the work that sent Brian into that 25-year spin.I don't criticize the film for not trying to tell Wilson's complete life story. The focus here is on SMiLE, as it should be. But after shaping a narrative that takes genius Brian to the point where he was about to re-order the landscape of American popular music, only to be cruelly rejected by his brothers and cousins, the timeline literally jumps 25 years into the future, skipping everything that happened to Wilson that turned him into the clearly damaged man we see on the screen today.No mention is made of the fact that a good half of ""Smile"" was subsequently recorded and released by the Beach Boys in the form of individual songs, none of which are heard in this film. (And it's jarring to hear contemporary recordings of the songs while the original 1966 sessions are being discussed.)Much, much better is the second half of the documentary, which picks up at a point where Wilson and his current band are already a functioning unit, having performed ""Pet Sounds"" and toured as a successful concert attraction. It's clear the decision to finish 'Smile"" is not an easy one for Brian, but he has an existing support team already at hand, talented musicians who are fully equal to the task of helping Wilson get through an emotionally arduous process (sometimes, apparently, by doing all the work themselves).The film lightly traces the process of reconstructing the original tracks, establishing where the gaps were, choosing a running order, filling the gaps with new or remembered music, deciding to focus the project on debuting as a concert work in London in April 2004, and then rehearsing, rehearsing, rehearsing. Throughout, we are never allowed to forget that for Wilson this is an emotion- and memory-laden process that appears to be causing him pain and sometimes causes him to withdraw.Still, the London debut is triumphant, and the sequences shot before, during, and after the concert are riveting and often moving.Aside from the music itself, much of the appeal here -- both during the second half of the documentary and throughout the concert on Disc 2 -- is Wilson's large, talented, and engaging band, who are clearly devoted to Wilson and his music while having a great deal of style and presence of their own.In all, this is a very generous package with a scintillating concert video at its core. The documentary and the bonus material (including several of the full interviews that were exerpted for the documentary) all offer insight into the Brian Wilson story, even if it's sometimes necessary to read way between the lines to see it.  Highly recommended.",5,"Glorious Music, Revisionist History",1117411200,"05 30, 2005",2005,4045,"['Buy', 'DVD', 'brilliantly-shot', '-recorded', 'complete', 'performance', 'SMiLE', 'will', 'open', 'music', 'up', 'way', 'simply', 'listening', 'CD', 'never', 'will', 'Worth', 'price', 'admission', 'alone.-', 'fascinating', 'behind-the-scenes', 'footage', 'shot', 'CD', 'recording', 'sessions.-', 'revealing', 'often', 'moving', 'sequences', 'shot', 'process', 'leading', 'up', 'debut', 'performance', 'SMiLE', 'London', '2004', 'contained', 'Beautiful', 'Dreamer', 'documentary', 'not', 'buy', 'DVD', 'true', 'story', 'why', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'original', 'Smile', 'was', 'never', 'finished', 'why', 'Brian', 'Wilson', 'essentially', 'disappeared', 'next', '25', 'years', 'Beautiful', 'Dreamer', 'interesting', 'addition', 'ever-growing', 'list', 'books', 'documentaries', 'Brian', 'Wilson', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'only', 'source', ""'re"", 'looking', 'balanced', 'view.Produced', 'largely', 'populated', 'current', 'Wilson', 'insiders', 'Beautiful', 'Dreamer', 'very', 'hard', 'whitewash', 'story', 'been', 'told', 're-told', 'many', 'others', 'who', 'were', 'there', 'time', 'Dismissing', 'discussion', 'destructive', 'power', 'drugs', 'drug', 'use', 'only', 'served', 'expand', 'Brian', 'consciousness', 'make', 'more', 'productive', ""'re"", 'told', 'form', 'mental', 'illness', 'other', 'undiagnosed', 'depression', 'film', 'blame', 'abandonment', 'Smile', 'feet', 'other', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'Apparently', 'was', 'rejection', 'work', 'sent', 'Brian', '25-year', 'spin.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'criticize', 'film', 'not', 'trying', 'tell', 'Wilson', 'complete', 'life', 'story', 'focus', 'here', 'SMiLE', 'should', 'be', 'shaping', 'narrative', 'genius', 'Brian', 'point', 'where', 'was', 're-order', 'landscape', 'American', 'popular', 'music', 'only', 'be', 'cruelly', 'rejected', 'brothers', 'cousins', 'timeline', 'literally', '25', 'years', 'future', 'skipping', 'everything', 'happened', 'Wilson', 'turned', 'clearly', 'damaged', 'man', 'see', 'screen', 'today.No', 'mention', 'made', 'fact', 'good', 'half', 'Smile', 'was', 'subsequently', 'recorded', 'released', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'form', 'individual', 'songs', 'none', 'are', 'heard', 'film', 'jarring', 'hear', 'contemporary', 'recordings', 'songs', 'original', '1966', 'sessions', 'are', 'being', 'discussed', 'Much', 'much', 'better', 'second', 'half', 'documentary', 'up', 'point', 'where', 'Wilson', 'current', 'band', 'are', 'already', 'functioning', 'unit', 'having', 'performed', 'Pet', 'Sounds', 'toured', 'successful', 'concert', 'attraction', 'clear', 'decision', 'finish', ""'Smile"", 'not', 'easy', 'one', 'Brian', 'existing', 'support', 'team', 'already', 'hand', 'talented', 'musicians', 'who', 'are', 'fully', 'equal', 'task', 'helping', 'Wilson', 'get', 'emotionally', 'arduous', 'process', 'sometimes', 'apparently', 'doing', 'work', '.The', 'film', 'lightly', 'process', 'reconstructing', 'original', 'tracks', 'establishing', 'where', 'gaps', 'were', 'choosing', 'running', 'order', 'filling', 'gaps', 'new', 'remembered', 'music', 'deciding', 'focus', 'project', 'debuting', 'concert', 'work', 'London', 'April', '2004', 'then', 'rehearsing', 'rehearsing', 'rehearsing', 'Throughout', 'are', 'never', 'allowed', 'forget', 'Wilson', 'emotion-', 'memory-laden', 'process', 'be', 'causing', 'pain', 'sometimes', 'withdraw.Still', 'London', 'debut', 'triumphant', 'sequences', 'shot', 'concert', 'are', 'riveting', 'often', 'moving.Aside', 'music', 'much', 'appeal', 'here', 'second', 'half', 'documentary', 'concert', 'Disc', '2', 'Wilson', 'large', 'talented', 'engaging', 'band', 'who', 'are', 'clearly', 'devoted', 'Wilson', 'music', 'having', 'great', 'deal', 'style', 'presence', 'own.In', 'very', 'generous', 'package', 'scintillating', 'concert', 'video', 'core', 'documentary', 'bonus', 'material', 'including', 'several', 'full', 'interviews', 'were', 'exerpted', 'documentary', 'offer', 'insight', 'Brian', 'Wilson', 'story', 'even', 'sometimes', 'necessary', 'read', 'way', 'lines', 'see', 'Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

Brian was superb, as was his great band. It is a miracle that we get to hear this work after all these years, and performed so well!! For you exercise enthusiasts, it is, surprisingly a great workout DVD (it has just entered my treadmill rotation). The second DVD in the set (documentary) is also a gem. The footage of Brian meeting Paul McCartney and shots of George Martin (and others in the audience)listening to the history making first performance are worth the price of admission alone. The rehearsal shots, including Brian's gradual development of interest in participating in the project is also interesting. Great video and audio. The cabin essence of a holiday which provides good vibrations for all of you fellow vegetables out there. A real triumph Brian!!

The CD release of this monumental work in 2004 was nothing short of miraculous, and I truly believe that ""Smile"" deserves recognition as one of the key masterworks of the 20th century (which happened to be delayed until the 21st century, so let's just say ""of the past 100 years""). The pain, suffering and creative doubt that haunted Brian Wilson for all these years over the public's willingness to accept ""Smile"" has finally been put behind him. The demons surrounding the project have vanished, and in their wake is a song cycle that celebrates life, love, and man's ability to dream. It truly is a pop symphony for God.Despite the obvious brilliance of ""Smile"", it remains possible that a huge portion of its potential audience will misconstrue the music, or perhaps not even get to hear it; Has any commercial radio station picked up on this disk? What sort of commercial environment do we live in when true genius - true commercial genius - is ignored by the corporate media? The ""Smile"" DVD goes a long way toward rectifying that problem, because it captures the beauty of the work, as performed live. But, more importantly, it contains a feature-length documentary called ""Beautiful Dreamer"" that tells the full story of the blood, sweat, tears, and mental anguish that went into its creation. I guarantee that if you watch ""Beautiful Dreamer"", the essence of ""Smile"" will open up before you and you will recognize its full majesty.Last year, I had the opportunity to see Brian Wilson perform ""Smile"" live at Carnegie Hall, and it remains one of my fondest memories of a live performance. At times, I was moved to tears by the sheer beauty of the band's performance, and the courage of Brian Wilson to realize a project that had haunted him for thirty-five years. The `live performance' disk on this 2-DVD collection (filmed in Los Angeles) allows me to relive that moment, and it confirms my impressions, while simultaneously affirming the power of the human spirit.As an obsessive record collector, I used to have recurring dreams about discovering music that didn't actually exist. In my dream, I would enter some unknown music store, and I would discover dozens of albums (it was an old dream, before CD's) that nobody else in the world ever heard. It was a happy dream for me, and with the release of ""Smile,"" that dream has come true.A++  Tom Ryan",5,Worth the Wait,1126828800,"09 16, 2005",2005,2466,"['are', 'few', 'stories', 'history', 'popular', 'music', 'could', 'eclipse', 'story', 'Smile', 'CD', 'release', 'monumental', 'work', '2004', 'was', 'nothing', 'short', 'miraculous', 'truly', 'believe', 'Smile', 'recognition', 'one', 'key', 'masterworks', '20th', 'century', 'happened', 'be', 'delayed', '21st', 'century', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'past', '100', 'years', 'pain', 'suffering', 'creative', 'doubt', 'haunted', 'Brian', 'Wilson', 'years', 'public', 'willingness', 'accept', 'Smile', 'finally', 'been', 'put', 'demons', 'surrounding', 'project', 'have', 'vanished', 'wake', 'song', 'cycle', 'life', 'love', 'man', 'ability', 'dream', 'truly', 'pop', 'symphony', 'God.Despite', 'obvious', 'brilliance', 'Smile', 'possible', 'huge', 'portion', 'potential', 'audience', 'will', 'misconstrue', 'music', 'perhaps', 'not', 'even', 'get', 'hear', 'Has', 'commercial', 'radio', 'station', 'picked', 'up', 'disk', 'What', 'sort', 'commercial', 'environment', 'do', 'live', 'when', 'true', 'genius', 'true', 'commercial', 'genius', 'ignored', 'corporate', 'media', 'Smile', 'DVD', 'long', 'way', 'rectifying', 'problem', 'beauty', 'work', 'performed', 'live', 'more', 'importantly', 'feature-length', 'documentary', 'called', 'Beautiful', 'Dreamer', 'full', 'story', 'blood', 'sweat', 'tears', 'mental', 'anguish', 'went', 'creation', 'guarantee', 'watch', 'Beautiful', 'Dreamer', 'essence', 'Smile', 'will', 'open', 'up', 'will', 'recognize', 'full', 'majesty.Last', 'year', 'had', 'opportunity', 'see', 'Brian', 'Wilson', 'perform', 'Smile', 'live', 'Carnegie', 'Hall', 'one', 'fondest', 'memories', 'live', 'performance', 'times', 'was', 'moved', 'tears', 'sheer', 'beauty', 'band', 'performance', 'courage', 'Brian', 'Wilson', 'realize', 'project', 'had', 'haunted', 'thirty-five', 'years', 'live', 'performance', 'disk', '2-DVD', 'collection', 'filmed', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'relive', 'moment', 'impressions', 'simultaneously', 'affirming', 'power', 'human', 'spirit.As', 'obsessive', 'record', 'collector', 'used', 'have', 'recurring', 'dreams', 'discovering', 'music', 'did', ""n't"", 'actually', 'exist', 'dream', 'would', 'enter', 'unknown', 'music', 'store', 'would', 'discover', 'dozens', 'albums', 'was', 'old', 'dream', 'CD', 'nobody', 'else', 'world', 'ever', 'heard', 'was', 'happy', 'dream', 'release', 'Smile', 'dream', 'come', 'true.A++', 'Tom', 'Ryan']",N/A
