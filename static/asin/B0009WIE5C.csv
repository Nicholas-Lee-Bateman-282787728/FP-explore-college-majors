It is a natural follow up to the previous videos, although I was kind of expecting a sentence/paragraphs one first.  My almost 4 year old does not get all of the educational content, but it seems to line up well with what my older child is doing in kindergarten (teaching characters, punctuation, prediction, etc).  My only major complaint is that ""learning to read"" happens really quick... it goes from Tad reading like a typical 5 year old (one word independent of the next) to fluent speech in the matter of about 20 minutes.  Doesn't seem to bother the children though!  I also am a little annoyed by some of the ""sideline"" stories... some of them are a little distracting and don't seem to add much in educational content or entertainment value.

He's then instructed how to read in a normal speaking voice and as the words are being read, they show up along the bottom bar of the tv screen so your child can follow along.  By the end of the movie, the words are moving so quickly across the screen that it would be hard for any beginner to keep up.SUMMARYWhile the story-line is entertaining and the principal of how Tad is taught to read is correct, the beginning reader is easily lost in the rate of speed the lines are read which can be frustrating.

PDD-NOS is on the Autism spectrum, and children with this diagnosis often have developmental delays.My son had a speech delay and other developmental delays. His speech is great now...no one can detect that he has this diagnosis. However, the delays have, understandably, affected his learning in some areas.While his spatial skills have been way above average--as has his grasp of science (such as planets and their attributes)--he has resisted reading. He gets tired and frustrated.Well, trying many approaches for helping him, I thought I'd take a chance and get the Learn to Read at the Storybook Factory DVD from Amazon.com, especially since the reviews were so good.My son IMMEDIATELY took to this DVD and watches it over and over! He's sounding out letters, ""chunking"", and trying to read on his own. I know that this DVD, along with Letter Factory and Talking Words Factory I, have contributed to his quick progress.The premise of this DVD is this: Mr. Websley (remember that grumpy duck from the other DVD's?) builds a Storybook Factory to create talking storybooks. Leap, Lily, and their friends act out ""The Three Little Pigs"", while Professor Quigley captures the scenes and words for the book. Tad, Leap and Lily's younger brother, is the narrator and is frustrated that he's having trouble reading. While he tries to read the script, he learns chunking and inflection and begins to gain confidence in his reading.The cool thing is that large text appears on the bottom of the screen during the scenes, with the words highlighted as Tad speaks them.Learn to Read at the Storybook Factory also teaches story comprehension, understanding character and plot, and even punctuation! There's a great section on punctuation with incredibly catchy tunes and visuals about periods (""full stop!""), commas, exclamation points, and question marks. My son goes around the house singing the lively tune ""Punc, Punc, Punc Punctuation..."" It's great!I feel this DVD is better suited to children who are ready to read and who have mastered (or are beginning to master) 3 letter words and can sound out words on their own.Highly recommended!",5,Great Follow Up DVD!,1138406400,"01 28, 2006",2006,2234,"['son', 'was', 'diagnosed', 'Pervasive', 'Development', 'Disorder', 'Not', 'Otherwise', 'Specified', 'when', 'was', '3', 'PDD-NOS', 'Autism', 'spectrum', 'children', 'diagnosis', 'often', 'have', 'developmental', 'delays.My', 'son', 'had', 'speech', 'delay', 'other', 'developmental', 'delays', 'speech', 'great', 'now', 'one', 'can', 'detect', 'diagnosis', 'However', 'delays', 'have', 'understandably', 'affected', 'learning', 'spatial', 'skills', 'have', 'been', 'way', 'average', 'grasp', 'science', 'such', 'planets', 'attributes', 'resisted', 'reading', 'tired', 'frustrated.Well', 'trying', 'many', 'approaches', 'helping', 'thought', ""'d"", 'take', 'chance', 'get', 'Learn', 'Read', 'Storybook', 'Factory', 'DVD', 'Amazon.com', 'especially', 'reviews', 'were', 'so', 'good.My', 'son', 'IMMEDIATELY', 'took', 'DVD', 'watches', 'over', 'sounding', 'out', 'letters', 'chunking', 'trying', 'read', 'own', 'know', 'DVD', 'Letter', 'Factory', 'Talking', 'Words', 'Factory', 'have', 'contributed', 'quick', 'progress.The', 'premise', 'DVD', 'Mr.', 'Websley', 'remember', 'grumpy', 'duck', 'other', 'DVD', 'Storybook', 'Factory', 'create', 'talking', 'storybooks', 'Leap', 'Lily', 'friends', 'act', 'Three', 'Little', 'Pigs', 'Professor', 'Quigley', 'scenes', 'words', 'book', 'Tad', 'Leap', 'Lily', 'younger', 'brother', 'narrator', 'frustrated', 'having', 'trouble', 'reading', 'read', 'script', 'chunking', 'inflection', 'gain', 'confidence', 'reading.The', 'cool', 'thing', 'large', 'text', 'bottom', 'screen', 'scenes', 'words', 'highlighted', 'Tad', 'them.Learn', 'Read', 'Storybook', 'Factory', 'also', 'story', 'comprehension', 'understanding', 'character', 'plot', 'even', 'punctuation', 'great', 'section', 'punctuation', 'incredibly', 'catchy', 'tunes', 'visuals', 'periods', 'full', 'stop', 'commas', 'exclamation', 'points', 'question', 'marks', 'son', 'house', 'singing', 'lively', 'tune', 'Punc', 'Punc', 'Punc', 'Punctuation', 'great', 'feel', 'DVD', 'better', 'suited', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'ready', 'read', 'who', 'have', 'mastered', 'are', 'beginning', 'master', '3', 'letter', 'words', 'can', 'sound', 'out', 'words', 'own.Highly', 'recommended']",LeapFrog: Learn to Read at the Storybook Factory
914806,A1LR0TUR4NTBCC,B0009WIE5C,"K. Evans ""allergyqueen""","[9, 11]","This is a decent video but not essential.  Now, the Letter Factory is definitely a must-have.  My son is almost 4 yrs old and has been moved to the ""Early Reading Program"" at his preschool even though his age group is typically in Phonics first, then upon an assessment of readiness, they are moved to reading.  He knew all his letters by 18 months old and knew the sounds of each letter by  3.  If you are looking to help your child learn letters, you should definitely get the Letter Factory.  It's amazing and fun to watch.  My son wanted to watch that more than the Baby Einsteins (other than Baby Macdonald).If you are wanting your child to read by 3 or 4, then this video is not going to help in my opinion.  It may possibly help for an older age group -- If anything, it helps get children almost ready to read in the right mind-set and tries to make it fun.  My son watched it a few times but wasn't hooked on it.  One thing that I didn't like is that the video only uses capital letters and that is not helpful when any book you pick up is going to have both upper and lower case letters.  If the child only sees words with all capital letters, than this is not going to help with reading a real beginner book like ""cat in the hat"".  The lower case letters are going to be foreign.From my internet research, children that can read at age 3 are usually the ones that learned by word-recognition/memory (i.e. not actually reading).

For unlike the other Leapfrog videos, this one is really meant for older children who are either on the verge of reading, or who have just started reading.I say this from observation of my son (3.5) and daughter (5.5) and their friends.  Those of them that are almost reading, or who are sounding out short words and sentences, understand the importance of punctuation and 'get' the songs and the points of the story which emphasize inflection and reading naturally (chunking).For the younger ones it just passes over their heads which is perfectly understandable since they haven't a good idea of what sentences and paragraph structure is all about.Five Stars.  It's short, but for the right kids it's an invaluable tool for teaching about story structure and reading.  Young children will watch Lily, Tad and the gang, but don't expect them to learn much.But buy this video.
