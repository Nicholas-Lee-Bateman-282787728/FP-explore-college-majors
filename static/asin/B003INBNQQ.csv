The villains in the movie were not who we thought.  It is action.

My only concern is that 50 Cents' character is not in the movie very much. But that seems to be the norm with pretty much all movies that 50 Cents is in. This movie is Still DEFINITELY worth seeing.,4,Good Action Flick,1295827200,"01 24, 2011",2011,319,"['good', 'movie', 'Lots', 'action', 'twist', 'guessing', 'very', 'end', 'Lots', 'shoot-em', 'bang', 'bang', 'only', 'concern', '50', 'Cents', 'character', 'not', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'be', 'norm', 'pretty', 'much', 'movies', '50', 'Cents', 'movie', 'Still', 'DEFINITELY', 'seeing']",N/A
1346795,A14PHEHVPVCDAH,B003INBNQQ,"S. Gardner ""wordsmith""","[2, 4]","The 50cent produced drama about the investigation into police corruption in a southern town provided enough action and plot twists to be enjoyable. All the actors gave solid performances, with 50cent in a slightly lesser, but different role than the characters he's played in the past. Adam Rodriguez was fantastic. Chris Kline was good, though southern accents may not be his strong suit. The storyline twists are probably good enough to keep you from guessing the ""real"" villain right off.

I like my share of cop drama movies but this particular film proved exactly why it went straight to DVD release. There was just too much bad acting, especially from Chris Klein, who was practically screaming all the time while ""trying"" to justify his actions and involvement in a dirty cop case. The twist at the end was short-lived and I felt like I wasted at least 90 minutes of my life after watching it.
