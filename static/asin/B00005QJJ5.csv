I thought it was cute how Mary-Kate's character fell in love with a childhood friend that she had known all of her life. I also thought Megan Fox did an amazing job in this video. It was one of her first scenes as an actress and she really nailed the mean girl character down!,5,This was fun!,1369008000,"05 20, 2013",2013,409,"['really', 'liked', 'movie', 'have', 'traditional', 'Mary-Kate', 'Ashley', 'plot', 'falling', 'love', 'tropic', 'place', 'thought', 'was', 'cute', 'how', 'Mary-Kate', 'character', 'fell', 'love', 'childhood', 'friend', 'had', 'known', 'life', 'also', 'thought', 'Megan', 'Fox', 'did', 'amazing', 'job', 'video', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'scenes', 'actress', 'really', 'nailed', 'mean', 'girl', 'character', 'down']",Holiday in the Sun VHS

But when compared to Passport To Paris, Our Lips Are Sealed and Winning London, this one is a bit shallow.Holiday In The Sun is the fourth in a series that is obiously growing with haste. It reflects this in the ending and by repeating the same girl meets boy thing from the previously mentioned films. It's just new names, some new faces in a new setting with very clueless parents. It's all becoming a little old and predictable.But don't get me wrong, I think any of the recent Mary-Kate & Ashley films are good. I give them credit for remaining clean in the language and conduct department. Their films are a good choice if you're looking for a movie to share with kids in their eary teens. Especially if you value some decency in what you watch, Holiday In The Sun follows that trend. Allthough it is not quite as good as the three previous travel films.

675459,A2T60EJILU9OPW,B00005QJJ5,"""lath123""","[1, 1]","After great master pieces of Winning London and Our lips are sealed, Mary-Kate and Ashley finally managed to make Passport to Paris no longer my least favorite Olsen movie. Some professional reviewers claimed that Holiday in the sun is a commercial for the Atlantis hotel... they are so 100% right! The DVD even starts with a commercial for Atlantis! Even before the Warner Bros logo pops up! How low can you go? I thought commercials were always a taboo for movie actors... either I am wrong with that thought, or the twins really need to do some major changes.There is absolutely nothing interesting in the plot and events, for so far any are happening, are short and shockey. The camera effects make it look as if the whole movie was just ripped of MTV. The whole movie is entirely inconsistent.Their dad for example is so young, that he can never be their dad, unless their mom did something very illegal. Keeping in that line, the guys Mary-Kate and Ashley date in the movie are also quite old for them.The end of the movie was highly ironical. It gave a sort of behind the scenes look. All actors dropped out of character and the director and such came on screen. It wasn't really the movie for it though. If they did it in Our lips are sealed, it would have been fun, as in that movie the characters &quot;know&quot; that they are &quot;in a movie&quot;. In Holiday in the sun, it was just so out of place.The ironic part is that the twins kinda confirm everything what they should improve. I hope they do so because they finally realize that they are going the wrong way.First of all there is the actress who plays mom. She calls her agent upset, claiming that the movie is just 100% Mary-Kate and Ashley, and that upsets here. Well, she isn't the only one, as this movie has just an enormous &quot;Look at me, I'm a Mary-Kate and Ashley movie&quot;-factor.Then there is Mary-Kate and Ashley, who are also producers of the movie. They joke on firing the director... not a bad idea girls. Perhaps firing the entire crew wouldn't be such a bad idea.The ending is the worst part though. The twins throw a dart at the world map for the location of their next movie. On the moment they did that, I lost a lot of faith in their credibility. What's wrong with a movie in the USA? Not that I mind those distant movies, but it makes just seem that they are only making movies because they like to travel. With their cash they can just go any where they like. Why should their holidays be supported by their fans? That is just what Holiday in the sun actually is, a holiday in the sun. And just as with Passport to Paris, they want to make money out of their movie.They also marked the places of the movies they made before. London, Paris, Sydney, the Bahamas so girls, you forgot the North American locations? Venice (Billboard Dad), New York city (It takes two), Toronto (Switching goals)? And how about the Olsen movies when they were still made for quality instead of money? Like How the west was fun and To grandmother's house we go?I just recommend that fans of the twins who want to stay fans do not watch this movie. Their &quot;fan-factor&quot; will plummet down massively, mine did. The twins seemed to have committed show-bizz suicide with the release of the movie.",1,A great way for the Olsen twins to get rid of some fans!,1007769600,"12 8, 2001",2001,3274,"['great', 'master', 'pieces', 'Winning', 'London', 'lips', 'are', 'sealed', 'Mary-Kate', 'Ashley', 'finally', 'managed', 'make', 'Passport', 'Paris', 'no', 'longer', 'least', 'favorite', 'Olsen', 'movie', 'professional', 'reviewers', 'claimed', 'Holiday', 'sun', 'commercial', 'Atlantis', 'hotel', 'are', 'so', '100', '%', 'right', 'DVD', 'even', 'commercial', 'Atlantis', 'Even', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'logo', 'up', 'How', 'low', 'can', 'go', 'thought', 'commercials', 'were', 'always', 'taboo', 'movie', 'actors', 'am', 'wrong', 'thought', 'twins', 'really', 'need', 'do', 'major', 'changes.There', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'interesting', 'plot', 'events', 'so', 'far', 'are', 'happening', 'are', 'short', 'shockey', 'camera', 'effects', 'make', 'look', 'whole', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'ripped', 'MTV', 'whole', 'movie', 'entirely', 'inconsistent.Their', 'dad', 'example', 'so', 'young', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'dad', 'mom', 'did', 'something', 'very', 'illegal', 'Keeping', 'line', 'guys', 'Mary-Kate', 'Ashley', 'date', 'movie', 'are', 'also', 'quite', 'old', 'them.The', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'highly', 'ironical', 'gave', 'sort', 'scenes', 'look', 'actors', 'dropped', 'character', 'director', 'such', 'came', 'screen', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'movie', 'did', 'lips', 'are', 'sealed', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fun', 'movie', 'characters', 'quot', 'quot', 'are', 'quot', 'movie', 'quot', 'Holiday', 'sun', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'place.The', 'ironic', 'part', 'twins', 'kinda', 'confirm', 'everything', 'what', 'should', 'improve', 'hope', 'do', 'so', 'finally', 'realize', 'are', 'going', 'wrong', 'way.First', 'actress', 'who', 'mom', 'agent', 'upset', 'claiming', 'movie', 'just', '100', '%', 'Mary-Kate', 'Ashley', 'upsets', 'here', 'Well', ""n't"", 'only', 'one', 'movie', 'just', 'enormous', 'quot', 'Look', ""'m"", 'Mary-Kate', 'Ashley', 'movie', 'quot', 'Mary-Kate', 'Ashley', 'who', 'are', 'also', 'producers', 'movie', 'joke', 'firing', 'director', 'not', 'bad', 'idea', 'girls', 'Perhaps', 'firing', 'entire', 'crew', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'such', 'bad', 'idea.The', 'ending', 'worst', 'part', 'twins', 'throw', 'dart', 'world', 'map', 'location', 'next', 'movie', 'moment', 'did', 'lost', 'lot', 'faith', 'credibility', 'What', 'wrong', 'movie', 'USA', 'Not', 'mind', 'distant', 'movies', 'just', 'seem', 'are', 'only', 'making', 'movies', 'like', 'travel', 'cash', 'can', 'just', 'go', 'where', 'like', 'Why', 'should', 'holidays', 'be', 'supported', 'fans', 'just', 'what', 'Holiday', 'sun', 'actually', 'holiday', 'sun', 'just', 'Passport', 'Paris', 'want', 'make', 'money', 'movie.They', 'also', 'marked', 'places', 'movies', 'made', 'London', 'Paris', 'Sydney', 'Bahamas', 'so', 'girls', 'forgot', 'North', 'American', 'locations', 'Venice', 'Billboard', 'Dad', 'New', 'York', 'city', 'two', 'Toronto', 'Switching', 'goals', 'how', 'Olsen', 'movies', 'when', 'were', 'still', 'made', 'quality', 'instead', 'money', 'How', 'west', 'was', 'fun', 'grandmother', 'house', 'go', 'just', 'recommend', 'fans', 'twins', 'who', 'want', 'stay', 'fans', 'do', 'not', 'watch', 'movie', 'Their', 'quot', 'fan-factor', 'quot', 'will', 'plummet', 'down', 'massively', 'mine', 'did', 'twins', 'seemed', 'have', 'committed', 'show-bizz', 'suicide', 'release', 'movie']",Holiday in the Sun VHS

I went on to reveal that we had an ever-escalating challenge to top the previous entry in our contest for sheer badness. She said ""Well I have the movie for you; I've seen this actually, and can highly recommend it to you,"" as she slipped a copy of ""Holiday in the Sun"" across the counter. Not being a fan of the Olsen twins I asked ""How bad is it?"" She replied ""Really bad. You'll win the contest...but I wonder what you'll get in return."" As I paid my $3.18 for it, she said ""That's money well spent...enjoy."" Since I had just watched David Hasselhoff wrestle CGI snakes in ""Anaconda 3"" I thought I was in pretty good shape for this one. Wrong! I am used to B-movies from around the world (Sci-fi movies about mutant worms, chickens, and turkeys? Check. Wrestling movies from Turkey? Check.) Nothing prepared me for the horror of the teenage comedic-romance-drama-resort promotion genre, however.Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen are two cute girls who have no real acting ability, and appeal mainly to pre-teens (especially girls) who envy children even more spoiled then themselves. In this film, Mary-Kate and Ashley finish a term in school and are whisked by their parents to the Atlantis Resort in Nassau, Bahamas. You will probably grasp pretty quickly that this is really a convergence of two equally heinous concepts right away: a teenage romantic adventure, and a cross-promotional advertisement for the Atlantis (you can't miss the blatant advertisement at the beginning, or the fact that they conveniently make it to about every activity the Atlantis provides to tourists.) Because their life is so hard (the girls are being flown to Nassau in their own private Gulfstream jet, and chauffeured in stretch limousines) they pout that they aren't going to Hawaii with their friends because they have, after all, worked hard in school and deserve this. (I taste bile.) Of course, once in Nassau they immediately declare it's even better than Hawaii (no it's not,) and proceed to chase boys and get embroiled in trouble. They even get their own suite at the hotel.The reign of terror expands to include even more bratty kids, and I positively guarantee that you will scream for mercy when the girls engage in a very long rhetorical debate about having your cake and eating it too. A screenwriting variant is the debate about whether it's OK to sleep in a bed that's just been made (""you made your bed, now you have to sleep in it,"" in other words.) You will also be astounded by the (mercifully short) argument about whether Antares is the largest red giant star in the galaxy, or merely the second largest! See, it's like they're totally smart and all! When they were very young and on television, the Olsen girls pretty much just had to be adorable and that was it. It's a good thing too, because their natural acting abilities are bordering on nil, and what could have been merely annoying here becomes enormously grating by their very presence.If you read the box, you know that ""amid the yachts, private jets, waverunners, scuba diving, motor scooters, horseback riding, and moonlit strolls, Mary-Kate and Ashley stumble across an antiquities smuggling ring,"" and sadly, this is all true. Not only do they highlight pretty much every activity you can do at the Atlantis Resort, they break into a yacht and discover illegal importing and exporting activities, they get arrested, go to jail, and their new boytoy Jordan gets framed. Of course they have to clear his name, donning their Columbo hats and becoming super-sleuths to discover the real smugglers. This basically means that they break into the yacht again and run around opening cabinets for what seems like hours. Good work, girls! (Groan.)The tacked-on ending with the cast coming out of character is probably the most painful single element of the film (especially their screen mother's irate phone call to her agent about how she was upstaged by the girls.) In this segment there is a discussion of how Mary-Kate and Ashley produced and hired the writers on ""Holiday in the Sun,"" and boy does it ever show. The movie starts out as a glorified advertisement for the Atlantis, mixed with scenes showing that the girls are beautiful geniuses, but when the whole smuggling angle is introduced it devolves into a stupefying incomprehensible mess. You'll doubtlessly be pleased to know that at the end of the film they throw a dart at a map of the world to decide where their next vacation film will be. They show the dart hurling toward the map, and just before it hits the credits roll.I don't know about you, but I'm hoping for Yemen.",1,Brats In The Bahamas,1275696000,"06 5, 2010",2010,5112,"['way',

Its actually probably my favorite Mary Kate and Ashley movie.The story can be a bit weak in parts, but is still entertaining. For example, they seem to be very rich (private plane, and complain aobut going to the Bahamas instead of Hawaii) and in the movie seem to do a lot of things which ordinary people could never do: like never waiting in lines at the water slides and other little things.One thing I love though, is that the outfits in this movie are great. They have different swimsuits in every swimming scene, and they are all very cool. The only outift in the whole movie that I dont like, is one shirt in the last scene that says He Loves Me on the back with a bow on the front.Anyways, overall the movie was good. I think their should have been more leading up to the whole antique smuggling thing though, because its kind of like 'umm where did that come from?'.
