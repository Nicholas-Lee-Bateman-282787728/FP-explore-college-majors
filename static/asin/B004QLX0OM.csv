This first set is only the beginning of a well written little adventure. I wont ruin any details of the story here for obvious reasons but anyone who enjoys this first set (and most of you will) should certainly get the remaining sets and not only that but the manga as well. The anime ties things up neatly at the end but leaves out a great deal of the total story.,4,Only the Beginning,1371686400,"06 20, 2013",2013,431,"['Neat', 'little', 'package', 'here', 'great', 'little', 'story', 'go', 'first', 'set', 'only', 'beginning', 'well', 'written', 'little', 'adventure', 'wont', 'ruin', 'details', 'story', 'here', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'anyone', 'who', 'first', 'set', 'most', 'will', 'should', 'certainly', 'get', 'remaining', 'sets', 'not', 'only', 'manga', 'as', 'well', 'anime', 'ties', 'things', 'up', 'neatly', 'end', 'out', 'great', 'deal', 'total', 'story']",N/A
1424685,ANAT3RRK6MPLM,B004QLX0OM,Don V,"[0, 0]","I was pretty surprised with how much i liked this set. I was kind of expecting the quality to be &#34;eh&#34;, but the picture was very clear, especially for dvd, and the sound is crisp. The only real complaints that can be given are as follows:1. I don't enjoy the subtitle style they use for translating kanji on screen. I feel like it takes up too much space and lacks grace.2. I feel like it could have come with more paper content inside. I know this is a common complaint, but I really enjoy opening a disc set and reading the literature.Aside from that, as said above i really like this set.The discs aren't stacked on top of each other(which i detest)- they're mounted on &#34;pages&#34; and connected to the case with little swing arms. As is the style lately it is a pretty thin set.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[16, 16]","For centuries, the Sumimura and Yukimura clans have sent out their kekkaishi (barrier-masters) to destroy demons, ghosts and monsters that go onto the magical Karasumori site.That's the basic description of ""Kekkaishi,"" a solid anime based on Yellow Tanabe's hit manga series. And ""Kekkaishi Set 1"" compiles the first thirteen episodes of this show -- still a little rough, but it's filled with with plenty of fantasy, action, a hint of potential romance, and a scruffy young hero whose duty is to zap evil supernatural beasties.Yoshimori Sumimura and his older friend Tokine Yukimura are the heirs of rival clans of kekkaishi, who have been feuding for hundreds of years. Every night the two of them (and their ghost dogs Madarao and Hakubi) venture out to the Karasumori site -- which also happens to be their school -- and use their powers to trap and kill any invading ayakashi.And when Yoshimori isn't doing his job, he's dealing with some unusual problems -- a dead confectioner who seems happy to stick around, a magical cherry tree, and a handsome teacher who seems to be dreaming energy from students.  But there are much more dangerous foes who Yoshimori and Tokine have to grapple with -- an ogre-tamer with a sinister motive, and a monstrous dog-demon who is determined to get power, revenge, and Madarao...The biggest problem with ""Kekkaishi Set 1"" is that it's kind of rough -- we have a lot of fluffy episodes about stuff like cockroaches, ghosts and chocolate cake. However, the show really blossoms when it's given a good balance of comedy, action and fantastical drama (such as the story of a girl who accidentally sees what the kekkaishi do).But the writers also insert some darker storylines into the series, and there are hints of very sinister, bloody conspiracies going on. The dialogue is always lots of fun (""It's on, illegally parked car!""), and there are countless scenes that show what the Yukimura and Sumumura families are like in their daily life. There's a lot of crazy stuff, particularly when the old people start screaming at each other.Yoshimori is a really likable hero -- he's a little clumsy, a little flaky, and prone to creative spurts that make him a formidable fighter. And his confectionary interests are very cute, since he aspires to make a giant castle out of cake. Tokine is a little cooler and more distant, but we also see that she's much fonder of Yoshimori than you'd think at first. And their ghost dogs (especially Madarao) are absolutely delightful.""Kekkaishi Set 1"" is the roughest part of the entire TV series, since it is still getting its footing. But it's still an entertaining round of episodes, and it promises to get even better.",4,KETSU!

The  Kekkaishi are warriors that fight monsters with their spiritual powers. Yoshimori is usually aloof, but shows great power and passion for his job when his childhood friend, Tokine is in danger. Tokine is a pretty 16 year old Kekkaishi. The 2 have been friends since they were children and protect their school grounds after dark. The school was built on a spot with great spiritual energy that makes it a hot spot for demons and ghosts. Together they fight for their families, their school, and each other.This anime is pretty fun. The series is mostly easy going, but also has some serious and darker themes lurking in the background. The animation, soundtrack, and voice actors are all very good. You'll recognize Vic Mignogna from shows like Full Metal Alchemist, Air, and Full Metal Panic. He plays Yoshimori, the main character.I don't really have anything to complain about with this show. But I also don't really have any reason to love this 1st collection either. It contains 13 episodes on 3 DVDs. The series doesn't really get going good yet. There are still about 40 episodes left. So far Kekkaishi is pretty riddled with fluff. I'm more into drama with great character development than the comedic mild action that this set displays so far. It does get better, so it's worth checking out. Even if you don't like it, it's not that expensive for the 1st set. Personally, I think this show is just a little better than average.

Karasumori School just happens to be setting on that supernatural land.Yoshimori Sumimura is an overconfident and determined 14- year old boy who attends Karasumori School. He's also the 22nd Kekkaishi of the Sumimura clan and is trained by his strict and short-tempered grandfather. Yoshimori is always competing against his older rival and crush, Tokine Yukimura. She is also a Kekkaishi, and a strict and hard-working one at that. She's known Yoshimori since childhood and even lives next door to him with her smug grandmother. Both Kekkaishi, especially their grandparents, are constantly arguing about who is the rightful heir as a barrier master.Yoshimori's goal is to continue to work hard to become the best so he can protect the ones he cares about. But it won't be easy. The most extremely powerful Ayakashi are showing up on the Karasumori site with an evil goal in mind. Yoshimori and Tokine can't defeat them alone and have to get help from Yoshimori's older brother, Masamori, the Chief of the Night Troops. This group is an interesting bunch with unique, but burdensome powers of their own. But having the Night Troops around also causes some problems with the Kekkaishi. Will they ever learn to get along?This is an entertaining and exciting anime. The show gets better with each episode. There are many likable characters in this interesting and creative story.
