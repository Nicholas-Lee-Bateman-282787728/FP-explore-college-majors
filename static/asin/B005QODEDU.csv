So, every year, we purchase one new movie to add to our collection. We have mostly full-length movies, which is great but sometimes we want to just sit down and watch a short film. When our family was sent the Ice Age: A MAMMOTH CHRISTMAS DVD, we were all really excited to see the movie. My kids, of course, loved the fact that it was another Ice Age movie, which was a perfect addition to the Ice Age collection already we have. I loved the fact that the movie is a short film, because sometimes life can get a little too hectic around the holidays, a short film allows us to be able to sit down and still enjoy a fun evening together, watching a holiday movie. This movie is fun and engaging and allows you to be able to spend time with some of the characters that you have grown to love in the Ice Age movies. The story is very funny and the animation is easily on par with the other Ice Age Movies. Even though the movie is short, your are still able to enjoy what it offers, as if it were a full length.

Internal consistency is important in all good storytelling, particularly in cartoons, and when writers deviate just because it proves to be convenient to do so that's nothing other than sloppy writing. So here we have a story that is set in the great Ice Age, yet for  some reason we have a very human Santa Claus and a bunch of animals who are about to celebrate Christmas. I found it to be rather novel that one character is credited with creating the Christmas tree--fine, this is supposed to be happening in pre-history so it makes sense. But then we have a flying reindeer (reindeer's being a species that would not even have existed during the period) who shows up out of nowhere and flies for no explained reason. And Santa Claus lives at the North Pole making toys for--whom? ""Children,"" according to the character, yet we never see any other humans anywhere.I won't bore you with any other details--first, it would be pointless and second, the run time of this is so short than you could watch its entirety as fast as you could read the review--but suffice it to say that I believe that the creative minds missed a huge opportunity here. A great Christmas-themed story could have been produced that did not deviate from the Ice Age mythos' established internal consistency. Why was Santa Claus needed? and why reindeer?

When Sid destroys Manny's Christmas Rock that has been passed down from generation to generation Manny tells him he's now on Santa's naughty list and he won't get Christmas. This devastates Sid and Peaches convinces him he should go to the North Pole to talk to Santa. So, Sid, Peach, Crash, and Eddie set out together following the Northern Lights to Santa's house. Along the way they meet a flying reindeer and an army of mini-sloths (who kind of look like elves), but their planned meeting with Santa doesn't quite go the way as planned and Christmas could be ruined for everyone. Also, like all the ICE AGE adventures, Scrat continues to chase that elusive acorn. Scrat's chase causes him to become a figure skater, has him kiss a prehistoric spider, and eventually leads him on a ride in Santa's sleigh.ICE AGE: A MAMMOTH CHRISTMAS SPECIAL is kind of cute. There are some things that completely don't make any sense such as how a frozen star can destroy a three-ton granite rock or why two adult wooly mammoths aren't able to pull a giant sled. Also, Santa isn't portrayed as his usual jolly self and though he makes toys for children, he's a bit conceited. For instance, he enjoys singing songs about himself and takes a little too much glee in creating the naughty list. He also gets angry rather easily and isn't at all optimistic. My favorite parts of the movie were the scenes with the mini-sloths (I think it was a neat touch that Santa's elves are actually mini-sloths) and all the scenes with Scrat.This short is a little bit pricey, but kids will enjoy it as well as ICE AGE fans. The DVD features a sneak peak clip of ICE AGE: CONTINENTAL DRIFT as well as a music video featuring a mini-sloth choir singing ""Swingin' Jingle Bells"".",3,"The First Christmas Tree, Flying Reindeer, and Why We Think Mini-sloths Are Elves",1322179200,"11 25, 2011",2011,1832,"['Christmas-time', 'Manny', 'Sid', 'Diego', 'are', 'preparing', 'upcoming', 'holiday', 'When', 'Sid', 'Manny', 'Christmas', 'Rock', 'been', 'passed', 'generation', 'generation', 'Manny', 'now', 'Santa', 'naughty', 'list', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'Christmas', 'Sid', 'Peaches', 'should', 'go', 'North', 'Pole', 'talk', 'Santa', 'So', 'Sid', 'Peach', 'Crash', 'Eddie', 'set', 'out', 'together', 'following', 'Northern', 'Lights', 'Santa', 'house', 'way', 'meet', 'flying', 'reindeer', 'army', 'mini-sloths', 'who', 'kind', 'look', 'elves', 'planned', 'meeting', 'Santa', ""n't"", 'quite', 'go', 'way', 'planned', 'Christmas', 'could', 'be', 'ruined', 'everyone', 'Also', 'ICE', 'AGE', 'Scrat', 'chase', 'elusive', 'acorn', 'Scrat', 'chase', 'become', 'figure', 'skater', 'kiss', 'prehistoric', 'spider', 'eventually', 'ride', 'Santa', 'sleigh.ICE', 'AGE', 'MAMMOTH', 'CHRISTMAS', 'SPECIAL', 'kind', 'cute', 'are', 'things', 'completely', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'such', 'how', 'frozen', 'star', 'can', 'destroy', 'three-ton', 'granite', 'rock', 'why', 'two', 'adult', 'wooly', 'mammoths', 'are', ""n't"", 'able', 'pull', 'giant', 'sled', 'Also', 'Santa', ""n't"", 'portrayed', 'usual', 'jolly', 'self', 'toys', 'children', 'bit', 'conceited', 'instance', 'singing', 'songs', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'glee', 'creating', 'naughty', 'list', 'also', 'angry', 'rather', 'easily', ""n't"", 'optimistic', 'favorite', 'parts', 'movie', 'were', 'scenes', 'mini-sloths', 'think', 'was', 'neat', 'touch', 'Santa', 'elves', 'are', 'actually', 'mini-sloths', 'scenes', 'Scrat.This', 'short', 'little', 'bit', 'pricey', 'kids', 'will', 'enjoy', 'as', 'well', 'ICE', 'AGE', 'fans', 'DVD', 'sneak', 'peak', 'clip', 'ICE', 'AGE', 'CONTINENTAL', 'DRIFT', 'as', 'well', 'music', 'video', 'featuring', 'mini-sloth', 'choir', 'singing', 'Swingin', 'Jingle', 'Bells']",N/A
