376071,A2CRUETJKX1WA5,6303467717,absent_minded_prof,"[35, 37]","In &quot;Nell,&quot; Jodie Foster wows us, as usual, with a deeply felt, passionate performance.  She is Nell, the &quot;wild child&quot; daughter of a backwoods aphasic hermit woman, who raised her all alone with no human contact.  Nell's speech is all her own -- it is a striking combination of a private language she had once shared with her deceased identical twin sister, and an imitation of her mother's speech.  Her mother, as I mentioned earlier, had aphasia, which includes major speech processing problems.  Nell's speech was the basis for the title of the play upon which this film was based -- &quot;Idioglossia.&quot;  (I believe, for anyone out there who's into things like this, that the correct term would have been &quot;idiolect,&quot; as the term for a language spoken by only one person.)  Natasha Richardson and Liam Neeson bring constant love and warmth to Nell, and to the film, as medical/social-work professionals who attempt to break through to Nell by trying to learn her language.  In the background lurk The Media, and The Scientific Establishment, both of which threaten at any moment to swoop in and make Nell's life miserable.  The film builds to a heartrending and passionate, albeit rather unrealistic, courtroom self-defence speech by Nell, in which she calls the precepts of modern civilization itself into question.Liam Neeson's performance is described by one of the editorial reviewers on this page as being &quot;at his teddy bear best.&quot;  I think that sounds slightly emasculating -- he put more positive, warm energy into this film than many actors project in their entire careers.  Show some appreciation!  Come on!Anyone who enjoys this film should also be told about &quot;Wild Child,&quot; a Francois Truffaut film that deals, through decidedly less rose-colored glasses, with a true story that was very similar to this one.  Another film that has certain parallel resonances, in the sense of a &quot;freakish&quot; individual seeking a chance to be themself in the face of major obstacles coming from the scientific establishment, is &quot;Charlie,&quot; starring Cliff Robertson and Claire Bloom.I thought about giving this movie four stars, only because it puts Nell in the rather unrealistic position of delivering a profound courtroom speech.  I decided to go with five, however, because the basic energy of the movie is so terrific.

376074,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6303467717,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","When I saw `Nell' as child, I laughed.  I just didn't connect to this film on any level.  When I was a teenager I wrote it off thanks to my former memory of it and so it wasn't until a few months ago that I even entertained the idea that I should give it another chance.  I'm glad that I did.  While the film is not perfect, and the overall message of the whole thing seems almost force-fed in the end (that courtroom speech feels forced), the film has a serious identity and it packs a punch thanks to a commanding turn from Jodie Foster and a streamlined focal point.The film centers on a doctor who discovers a young woman no one was aware existed, living in the shack of a deceased old woman.  Her behavior is odd and her speech is even odder and this interests the doctor.  With the discovery of this bizarre young woman, this doctor begins to fight an almost uphill battle as he attempts to keep her shielded from the inevitable (psychiatric confinement and study).  He works to understand her backstory as well as her language and unlocks her past in order to save her future.The film would have fallen to pieces had Foster not been so grounded and dedicated to the role.  I'm not an advocate for her as an actor, to be honest, and I'm often the first one to criticize the blandness of her acting, but she really nails this and delivers possibly her finest performance.  This is an extremely hard role to master and deliver without coming across as campy or awkward, but she handles herself like a true professional.  Honestly, had Oscar not showered her with two underserving wins, she probably would have won the Oscar for this.`Nell' is one of those film that could really use a rewatch from many, I'm sure.

It did not make sense. Language is learned when children are very young. That would not have been when Nell's mother had her series of strokes. Nell would have already learned how to talk.  Supposing the strokes could have and did occur when the woman was young? Who would have looked after Nell then, while this woman was recovering?  Nell was supposedly not retarded.  However, if she was, the movie would have made more sense. I also felt that Nell's repetitive motions went on a bit longer than they should have.  I found myself saying &#34;get on with it&#34;.

376078,ANGH6401L9Y0T,6303467717,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[1, 1]","Jodie Foster is brilliant as Nell, a young woman who has lived in the deep woods all her life, never knowing anyone but her recluse mother and her long dead twin sister. She speaks a language of her own, apparently derived from Biblical English and the twin-speak she and her sister developed in their isolated world.When her mother finally dies, the young man who normally delivered their groceries (and who didn't even know Nell existed) discovered the old recluse's body, all laid out properly. He told the sheriff, who took the local doctor along to investigate. Dr. Jerome Lovell (Liam Neeson) discovers Nell hiding in the cabin after the sheriff has left with the body, and he doesn't quite know what to do about her. But Dr. Paula Olsen (Natasha Richardson, Neeson's real-life wife), a psychiatric researcher he consults, wants to bring her to the hospital to be studied. Dr. Lovell argues that she should stay in her natural environment, and a judge gives them three months to study her in her own home before he makes a decision.They untangle a lot of the facts about her life, especially after Jay Lovell starts to translate her language, and then Dr. Olsen makes the startling discovery that it is in fact English, more or less. Working somewhat together and somewhat at odds with one another, Jay and Paula are encouraged by Nell to be friends, and eventually lovers.There are no real villains in the piece, except to the extent that people who would like to exploit Nell are pretty villainous from her point of view. In her language, she calls them evil-doers, apparently due to a Bible passage. It becomes clear that she and her twin were the product of a rape, and that their mother taught them to hate and fear men. She trusts Jay mostly because she decides he is her guardian angel (another of her words that took some time to translate).It's a fascinating story, and I looked in vain for evidence that it was based on a true story. It is that well-written and acted and produced, that it was very easy to believe it was real.

376081,A3K8POFWCQI2GS,6303467717,Char,"[0, 0]","I think it's best for the viewer to experience this movie without knowing the plot, so I'll try not to reveal much of the plot in my review.  It's an excellent movie that I think will be meaningful (and delightful) to any sensitive and caring person.It's the unusual story of a ""wild-child,"" an ""uncivilized"" adult girl found living in the mountainous backwoods of North Carolina.  The doctor who discovers her also discovers, when he opens a Bible, that he has been appointed (more or less by God) to be the girl's ""guardian angel."" In a sense, he tries to be her ""savior"" too.The movie is based on a play that was entitled ""Idiographia,"" so the language factor must have been central in the play as it is in the movie.  The title of the movie is ""Nell,"" and it focuses upon the opening up of communication that allows a CONNECTION (note the scene of two hands of two persons reaching out and clasping) and the emergence of a Person.  Relational knowledge and love becomes possible for all the characters involved in the story.One theme that the movie touches on is ""innocence""--and the violation of it.  (As, for instance, the innocence that existed in Paradise and its absence after the Fall.  This is my own choice to make the comparison relating the movie to the events of Genesis, but it's an apt comparison that fits the setting and the relational love plot.  The movie doesn't OVERTLY suggest that any comparison should be made to Biblical concepts and images, but I would say that it does subtly invite such comparisons which can add depth to the story when looking at it in retrospect.)Another theme in the movie is aloneness and specifically alienation from the ability of loving relationships (embodied even more in the modern urban civilization than in the isolated woods).  While the movie weaves into the plot the tragedy of modern sexual alienation, it also includes two hopeful and positive male-female relationships.  And it includes the importance of relations of friendship, the inter-relational compassion that all humans are capable of.Fortunately, I watched this movie a second time (about a year after the first viewing).  After the second viewing I realized how good the movie was and decided to write a review recommending it highly.An important thing I noticed on the second viewing was the great importance to Nell of her twin sister.  That love relationship was the most significant and joyful one that Nell had known, and it was steeped in childhood innocence.(At a subtle level, if the viewer wanted to consider a psychological interpretation, I guess that relationship of Nell and her twin could also signify a person's loving relationship with self.  But, again, this is not a concept that the movie deliberately deals with.  But, I do think the movie intends to help viewers grow in their inner selves, becoming more capable of being loving persons.)Nell remains a beautiful innocent, but not innocent of sorrow.  She also becomes an unexpected agent of compassion and healing, not merely the needy object of compassion.If you can look into it attentively and appreciate it well, this is a beautiful, beautiful movie.The final scene is satisfying for the viewer, but it leaves some practical questions unanswered.(I think only adults would appreciate the movie.  One or two scenes might be disturbing for children.)",5,"Beautiful, beautiful movie",1378166400,"09 3, 2013",2013,3349,"['think', 'best', 'viewer', 'experience', 'movie', 'knowing', 'plot', ""'ll"", 'try', 'not', 'reveal', 'much', 'plot', 'review', 'excellent', 'movie', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'meaningful', 'delightful', 'sensitive', 'caring', 'person.It', 'unusual', 'story', 'wild-child', 'uncivilized', 'adult', 'girl', 'found', 'living', 'mountainous', 'backwoods', 'North', 'Carolina', 'doctor', 'who', 'also', 'discovers', 'when', 'Bible', 'been', 'appointed', 'more', 'less', 'God', 'be', 'girl', 'guardian', 'angel', 'sense', 'be', 'savior', 'too.The', 'movie', 'based', 'play', 'was', 'entitled', 'Idiographia', 'language', 'factor', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'central', 'play', 'movie', 'title', 'movie', 'Nell', 'opening', 'communication', 'CONNECTION', 'note', 'scene', 'two', 'hands', 'two', 'persons', 'reaching', 'out', 'clasping', 'emergence', 'Person', 'Relational', 'knowledge', 'love', 'becomes', 'possible', 'characters', 'involved', 'story.One', 'theme', 'movie', 'touches', 'innocence', 'violation', 'instance', 'innocence', 'existed', 'Paradise', 'absence', 'Fall', 'own', 'choice', 'make', 'comparison', 'relating', 'movie', 'events', 'Genesis', 'apt', 'comparison', 'setting', 'relational', 'love', 'plot', 'movie', ""n't"", 'OVERTLY', 'suggest', 'comparison', 'should', 'be', 'made', 'Biblical', 'concepts', 'images', 'would', 'say', 'subtly', 'invite', 'such', 'comparisons', 'can', 'add', 'depth', 'story', 'when', 'looking', 'retrospect', 'theme', 'movie', 'aloneness', 'specifically', 'alienation', 'ability', 'loving', 'relationships', 'embodied', 'even', 'more', 'modern', 'urban', 'civilization', 'isolated', 'woods', 'movie', 'plot', 'tragedy', 'modern', 'sexual', 'alienation', 'also', 'two', 'hopeful', 'positive', 'male-female', 'relationships', 'importance', 'relations', 'friendship', 'inter-relational', 'compassion', 'humans', 'are', 'capable', 'of.Fortunately', 'watched', 'movie', 'second', 'time', 'year', 'first', 'viewing', 'second', 'viewing', 'realized', 'how', 'good', 'movie', 'was', 'decided', 'write', 'review', 'recommending', 'highly.An', 'important', 'thing', 'noticed', 'second', 'viewing', 'was', 'great', 'importance', 'Nell', 'twin', 'sister', 'love', 'relationship', 'was', 'most', 'significant', 'joyful', 'one', 'Nell', 'had', 'known', 'was', 'steeped', 'childhood', 'innocence', 'subtle', 'level', 'viewer', 'wanted', 'consider', 'psychological', 'interpretation', 'guess', 'relationship', 'Nell', 'twin', 'could', 'also', 'signify', 'person', 'loving', 'relationship', 'self', 'again', 'not', 'concept', 'movie', 'deliberately', 'deals', 'do', 'think', 'movie', 'help', 'viewers', 'grow', 'inner', 'selves', 'becoming', 'more', 'capable', 'being', 'loving', 'persons', 'Nell', 'beautiful', 'innocent', 'not', 'innocent', 'sorrow', 'also', 'unexpected', 'agent', 'compassion', 'healing', 'not', 'merely', 'needy', 'object', 'compassion.If', 'can', 'look', 'attentively', 'appreciate', 'well', 'beautiful', 'beautiful', 'movie.The', 'final', 'scene', 'satisfying', 'viewer', 'practical', 'questions', 'unanswered', 'think', 'only', 'adults', 'would', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'One', 'two', 'scenes', 'might', 'be', 'disturbing', 'children']",Nell VHS

After a lot of people watched the film and the subseqent VHS, I noticed a lot of people annoyed at Jodie Foster's character in the movie, a woman who uttered constantly incoherent phrases. It became aggravating to some.  I didn't find that on the first viewing but I admit, it did on the second and third.The point is, if you haven't the film, check it out, but it may not be one you'd want to see multiple times.  Then again.......Liam Neeson played a no-nonsense good guy. His wife, Natasha Richardson, who tragically died just a week ago,  also adds to this unique story.

376086,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,6303467717,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[87, 91]","While Hollywood is filled with movie stars, it can boast of only a scant few bona fide actresses.  Jodie Foster, the consummate professional, is the cream of that small crop, and I respect no other actor or actress on earth as much as I respect her.  Nell is a testament to her unlimited talent as well as her unmatched commitment to what she does.  The character of Nell is a role most actresses would never consider taking; it's a far too difficult challenge to meet for a film that holds little promise to bring in money hand over fist.  For Jodie Foster, though, what matters is the story to be told, not the glamour or the projected box office receipts.  She gives an absolutely amazing performance in this film, one that has deserved far more attention than it has received; as I write this, there is not even a DVD version of the film available.  If Nell is mentioned at all, it is almost always in reference to Jodie's Foster nudity in the film, and I would like to say straight out that her nudity is very tastefully done, important if not absolutely necessary for the story, and in no way provocative.Nell is a poignant, emotional drama that saddens as well as inspires you; it is the kind of tearjerker in which your tears of empathy and concern are accented by a smile and sense of heartwarming joy.  The story is set deep in the wilderness of western North Carolina, where an old woman has lived for years all by herself.  People always thought she lived alone, at least, until she died and the local doctor discovered a pitiful woman-child hiding inside the shack, the only home she had ever known.  Nell's mother had suffered a stroke many years earlier and spoke with a pronounced speech impediment; as a result, Nell speaks a tongue that is almost completely foreign to both the local doctor and the psychiatric professional he calls in from Charlotte.  Dr. Lovell (Liam Neeson) becomes a guardian angel of sorts to Nell, fighting the courts and the mental health professionals to keep Nell in her native environment as opposed to being stuck in some institution where she will be treated as a lab subject.  He gets three months to work with Nell himself, and his potential foe in the form of psychologist Paula Olsen (Natasha Richardson) becomes his ally in time, as they both work with Nell to learn her unique language and prepare her for a life completely unlike that which she has always known.  In her own special way, Nell helps the two doctors as much as they help her, yet their ability to protect her from a dire future of lonely clinical existence remains in doubt up until the very end.Neeson and Richardson are wonderful in their roles, but Jodie Foster is simply amazing.  She had to learn a completely new, invented language as well as adopt a wide range of meaningful facial and body expressions and unique mannerisms in order to portray this ""wild child"" as a very real, very human individual.  Nell is easily one of Foster's most impressive performances, and how she did not win an Oscar for this role is beyond me.  It should also be noted that Foster produced as well as starred in this unforgettable film.  The scenery, I might add in closing, is also spectacular.  Filmed largely in the Nantahala National Forest in Graham County, North Carolina, a location just west of my own home, Nell is a beautiful sight to behold in more ways than one.

376087,A35K84RT618N3A,6303467717,David Robson,"[16, 26]","Nell is an earnest and slightly soporific drama about a doctor's inadvertant discovery of a wild child in the remote hills of North Carolina.  Jerry Lovell (Liam Neeson), a rural MD is dispatched to confirm  the death of a hermit-like mountain lady and is quick to discover a  cantankerous, violent, and unintelligible young woman, obviously the old  woman's unacknowledged daughter,hiding in the cabin rafters. Lovell is  immediately captivated by Nell (Jodie Foster) and is soon joined by  career-climbing psychologist Paula Olsen (Natasha Richardson) in  attempting to decode the mysterious woman's gibberish-filled rages. Before  you can say &quot;Wapner at 5:30,&quot; this hillbilly rain woman's past  becomes brutally clear: her mother, a victim of rape in her youth, had  given birth to the child but kept her a secret from the the world for  thirty years; Nell has been taught that men and daylight are harmful, and  her language is the product of imitation after her mother's stroke.The  sentiment here is laid on thick. Nell is harrassed by those stereotypical  movie rejects, scientists and red necks. The scientists want her brought in  for study; the red necks want to play a little doctor (Can you say  Deliverance?) There are a number of nice scenes portraying the bonding  between the three leads, and the direction by the talented Michael Apted is  sensitive and well-intentioned, but Nell suffers by asking us to shed too  many unearned tears. In this regard, most damaging is the lack of key  exposition. We never really get to know Nell. Her mystery, while at first  quite interesting, loses its novelty by the time they take the wide-eyed  country girl to the big bad city.The biggest roadblock has to be Jodie  Foster. Her pagan-like emoting as she dances naked through the woods is two  stations short of hamville. It's like she wants us to believe so  desperately in Nell's tragic story that she has to use a few neon signs to  show us the way. Thanks, but I think we can handle it ourselves. Neeson is  more effective, and he and real-life wife Richardson do a nice job of  counterbalancing Foster's excess in the role of Nell's surrogate ma and pa.",2,Oh Nelly!,958089600,"05 12, 2000",2000,2175,"['Nell', 'earnest', 'slightly', 'soporific', 'drama', 'doctor', 'inadvertant', 'discovery', 'wild', 'child', 'remote', 'hills', 'North', 'Carolina', 'Jerry', 'Lovell', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'rural', 'MD', 'dispatched', 'confirm', 'death', 'hermit-like', 'mountain', 'lady', 'quick', 'discover', 'cantankerous', 'violent', 'unintelligible', 'young', 'woman', 'obviously', 'old', 'woman', 'unacknowledged', 'daughter', 'hiding', 'cabin', 'rafters', 'Lovell', 'immediately', 'captivated', 'Nell', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'soon', 'joined', 'career-climbing', 'psychologist', 'Paula', 'Olsen', 'Natasha', 'Richardson', 'attempting', 'decode', 'mysterious', 'woman', 'gibberish-filled', 'rages', 'can', 'say', 'quot', 'Wapner', '5:30', 'quot', 'hillbilly', 'rain', 'woman', 'past', 'becomes', 'brutally', 'clear', 'mother', 'victim', 'rape', 'youth', 'had', 'given', 'birth', 'child', 'kept', 'secret', 'world', 'thirty', 'years', 'Nell', 'been', 'taught', 'men', 'daylight', 'are', 'harmful', 'language', 'product', 'imitation', 'mother', 'stroke.The', 'sentiment', 'here', 'laid', 'thick', 'Nell', 'harrassed', 'stereotypical', 'movie', 'rejects', 'scientists', 'red', 'necks', 'scientists', 'want', 'brought', 'study', 'red', 'necks', 'want', 'play', 'little', 'doctor', 'Can', 'say', 'Deliverance', 'are', 'number', 'nice', 'scenes', 'portraying', 'bonding', 'three', 'leads', 'direction', 'talented', 'Michael', 'Apted', 'sensitive', 'well-intentioned', 'Nell', 'suffers', 'asking', 'shed', 'too', 'many', 'unearned', 'tears', 'regard', 'most', 'damaging', 'lack', 'key', 'exposition', 'never', 'really', 'get', 'know', 'Nell', 'mystery', 'first', 'quite', 'interesting', 'novelty', 'time', 'take', 'wide-eyed', 'country', 'girl', 'big', 'bad', 'city.The', 'biggest', 'roadblock', 'be', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'pagan-like', 'emoting', 'woods', 'two', 'stations', 'short', 'hamville', 'believe', 'so', 'desperately', 'Nell', 'tragic', 'story', 'use', 'few', 'neon', 'signs', 'show', 'way', 'Thanks', 'think', 'can', 'handle', 'Neeson', 'more', 'effective', 'real-life', 'wife', 'Richardson', 'do', 'nice', 'job', 'counterbalancing', 'Foster', 'excess', 'role', 'Nell', 'surrogate', 'ma', 'pa']",Nell VHS

Or are they shaped by their environment?  If it is a combination of both, what is the ratio?  And, the beat goes on.....This is a movie which explores that topic to some degree.  Jodie Foster plays a young woman (Nell) who has been raised in almost absolute seclusion from the rest of the world.  She has her own language which she uses from the garbled words of her grandmother who had a speech-impediment.  She knows nothing of the world beyond the cabin where she lives, and she's afraid to go outside during the daytime.Liam Neeson & the late Natasha Richardson portray a physician & a shrink, respectively.  They both have the best interests of Nell in mind & end up in an unlikely alliance to look out for her.  After all, being exposed to a big city is an unnerving & stressful thing for a young lady that has only known the peace & tranquility of the forest all her life.It goes without saying that it's absolutely painful to see Natasha Richardson with the man who was her real-life husband.  She is so very beautiful & full of life;  it's a tragedy that she was taken from us too soon.

She's been living with her late mother her entire life, and now she's in complete isolation with only a handful of people ever realizing her existence. She has her own language, her own shelter, and her own look at the beautiful world around her. Jerome and Paula (Liam Neeson & the late Natasha Richardson) are doctors who examine her language and her communication skills. These will help them figure out if Nell is able to handle the real world (the world that she has hardly any knowledge of).This has to be one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. The woods and lakes of North Carolina are magnificently shot. The music by Mark Isham is ambient and effective. The look and feel of this film is extraordinarily beautiful. Plus, this is one of Jodie Foster's finest performances. Her unusual movements and behaviors are almost flawless when seen onscreen. Neeson and Richardson are also fantastic as the two doctors who realize that Nell is more than just a so-called ""wild child."" Jeremy Davies, Nick Searcy, Richard Libertini, and Robin Mullins make a fine supporting ensemble. Now, some people have criticized this movie for being too melodramatic.

And so first half of Nell opens our eyes to its possabilities but Hollywood fails to deliver on the theme of our deeper Being when innocent and natural/ in tune with Nature . Unfortunately Nelll is inarticulate.and therefore doomed to be mis- understood;;the film is also doomed to sentimentality.Fast forward to the end I find it deeply insulting that Nell is considerd too impaired to have a child of her own .Seems obvious the child would have taught her to connect and mature and she would have been a wonderfull mum instead the film patronises with the premise that children should only be born from mature adult sexual union from which Nell is banned.

Even those who actually are living in the years we  label as childhood suffer from our drive to get them out of it. The eleven  year-old who would play with dolls, or would rather paint than study math,  or would do a Nell's dance at a family get-together - all feel our need to  make them grow up, to be interested in important endeavors like, maybe,  school achievement, team sports, life goals, and, naturally, repressing  impulsive behaviors (you might check out the character of twelve year-old  Elsie in &quot;Fairy Tale: A True Story&quot;. Now, as then, she would be  expected to put away childish things).As to the movie, I don't think  it's a spoiler to say I think the high point of the movie wasn't the  courtroom scene. I think the story turned on the moment Paula (Natasha  Richardson) found solace in Nell's hands, when Nell was no longer a  subject, but a needed co-human.I thought &quot;Nell&quot; was a well  produced, directed, and acted movie. Jodie Foster, Liam Neeson, Natasha  Richardson and the rest of the cast were outstanding.

She seems retarded at first until we realize that her mother was a stroke victim and she experienced an emotional trauma in childhood.  This has resulted with her developing her own private language. When the good doctor played by Liam Neeson discovers her, he wants to keep her from the psychologists who want to hospitalize and study her. The court gives him three months to observe her in the wild, and he is joined by Natasha Richardson, a graduate psychology student, to do this observation.Jodie Foster's performance is outstanding.  The audience cannot understand her language but her emotions are clear.  As the film evolves, however,  we do understand some of her words as she gradually learns to speak English. There's a subplot of a romance between the doctor and the psychology student and a few bad guys including a journalist who wants to expose her to the world.  And yes, the cinematography is fine.However, the story does not ring true, not one bit.  There are too many holes in the plot and a contrived silly ending.  Specifically, we never understand how Nell manages to survive.  We see her dancing naked in the moonlight but never see her looking for food or chopping wood or doing any of the thousands of things necessary to live all alone in a rural area.  The film is also too long and the pacing slow.  I just couldn't stop thinking of all the opportunities the writer of the screenplay missed to make the story believable.Unless you're a particular Jodie Foster fan and want to see an outstanding performance, I can't recommend this video.

Shes simply Amazing as Nell. This is a phenominal actress who took on this role of a lifetime and turned it into gold. Jodie Foster had to bare her soul to play this part, and its simply amazing to watch her lay herself bare in body and soul to play this unique character. This is a great actress in an unforgettable role. Both Liam Neeson and Miranda Richardson rise completely to the occasion as two physicians trying to communicate with Nell who speaks her own language. They were both wonderful. And it reminded me that nearly 8 or 10 years ago Richardson passed away. Very sad indeed. I remember seeing her as an evil and heartless b i t c h in the made for TV film- Born Innocent which featured Linda Blair in the lead role. Its amazing to know Richardson was able to avoid being type cast after the nasty role she played in that film which was made in the mid 1970s, and she went on to better things despite the part. Its indeed sad shes no longer on this earth because she truly was a great actress. Anyway This film is full of beautiful moments, spiritual realization and love.

How she didn't get an oscar for her performance says more about the oscars than about the enormous range and empathy of this superb actress.She was assisted by a wonderful complementary and vulnerable performance from Liam Neesom and the sensitive exploration of a very difficult subject by Michael Apted. I found myself crying without immediately understanding why. I then realised that the film had plumbed the depths of my humanity to levels I did not realise existed.

376138,AX7Q8AOSGGVWJ,6303467717,"Sakuteiki ""sakuteiki""","[2, 2]","A well loved, cared for, clean, healthy young woman is left alone by the deaths first of her identical twin, then of her mother. The women lived in isolation in remote Appalachia for the twins' entire lives. The mother was raped as a young woman, suffered a stroke, then withdrew to forest solitude for self protection with her bible as comfort.The babies taught themselves twin speech, idioglossia, a private language developed when there is restricted language input. The mother's stroke limits speech, except for the passionate musicality of memorized rote recitation of bible passages. Brain areas for music are distinct from those for speech and may be spared in stroke. That may be the reason those who speak more than one language particularly musical languages (Chinese, French) are more resilient after brain attack.The mother's stroke results in halt gait mimicked by the twins, who are cautioned to avoid daylight as dangerous. The mother's intention is to protect the twin girls from being seen, and possibly raped by an ""evildoer"" with a ""skewer."" The mother realizes she may one day pass on, and leaves an ethical will in her bible to whomever finds the adult child after her death, requesting compassion, caregiving and protection.Nell is not a feral child (raised in wilderness among animals without human speech). Nell was well loved, has language, openness, intuition for emotional connection, empathy for feelings. Her natural diet (no junk food) and self care result in strong teeth, bones, mental health. Her language is unintelligible except to her twin and mother. Interestingly she uses te for me. In Latin te means thee or you.When Nell is threatened she speaks into a mirror, to an image of her dead twin, reciting over and over ""may and te"" as if she has no identity separate from her remembered twin and feels comfort in their fusion. This developmental step is not taken until later in the movie when she releases her infancy and joins reality.Nell is not autistic, her social relationship skills are excellent. A non-actor autistic child Nicole appears with her mother in the hospital scene in order to inform the viewer of the difference between autism and idioglossia (unique private language)Temple Grandin.The nurturing environment of wilderness, soul quiet allows Nell to retain images of her other half for soothing comfort against confusion or vulnerability. Their childhood games of holding one another's hands in body mimicry, falling backward into the lake, dancing and caressing one another in sleep are her respite from threat.Nell exposes lies we tell ourselves about the meaning of life. Nell suggests verbal language inhibits deep resonance between human beings. Talking offers an illusion of connection behind a wall of self deception about who we really are.Nell is never alone because she has the memory of being well loved. Her uninhibited spontaneity allows her to bring up the imagery she needs for calming at will, the mindful awareness of meditationDhamma Brothers.Later, as Nell is introduced to modern society, sheds her imaginative capacity and bids an agonized farewell to her twin image forever. The grief seen on Nell's face as she reflects on who she used to be, and who she is now, is complexly entwined with the joy of new real human connections.Both the sorrow of loss and joy coexist in the last scene. Nell teaches a real child the freedom of movement as emotion.Holding onto the illusion of someone else outside, a guardian angel, a doctor, a therapist, being able to create meaning will always lead to loss. Everyone leaves, dies, withdraws.Nell leads a small life with a small answer to meaning in life: physical-emotional connection with humans. She gives up the fantasy memory of her twin for real human beings in the present with regret.Nell's intense focus absorbs the emotions of others, without guile or deception. Her face is blank, open receptive, which may appear incomprehending but is simply a reflection of her total concentration on the other person, sometimes losing her own identify in the focus.The meeting of two personalities is like the contact of two chemical substances; if there is any reaction, both are transformed.  JungFor Nell contact with the outside represents danger, even from well-meaning physicians not be able to protect her from exploitation by media, researchers, groupies. The loss of all that is familiar with meaning for Nell is dramatic and overwhelming as she is consigned to a psychiatric hospital. Nell withdraws into mute paralysis for protection from overstimulation.The courtroom fight over her right to autonomy vs. institutionalization under guardianship is thoughtful and moving.Nell's lullaby was bible reading, rote memorized for self comfort, a form of meditation (compare withDhamma BrothersVipassana meditation). Nell is naturally open, exposed, vulnerable. Her heart truth is on her face, her moral compass is godliness. Her speech is entwined with body movement, dance: hugs, touching hand to face, forehead to forehead to reconciliation. Perhaps if we attempt conflict resolution with forehead to forehead empathy we may be more successfully connected. When my mother was dying of stroke in coma for months I put my forehead to hers, she reached her hand up and pulled my neck close. Human connection without words.Nell is not intellectual verbal, she is intuitively emotional. A life of solitude enables Nell to listen without judging to her own and others' feelings.The Sheriff's wife has panic attacks which are soothed by hand dance movement with Nell.  Nell's gift is unspoken empathy. She reminds us to listen to our bodies for what we genuinely need (not just want).In order for a baby to survive, a mother bird shoves the baby out of the nest when it is time to learn to fly. If you genuinely love someone, you must push them into the world, they need and deserve the truth for their survivalCedar Rapids,Toy Story 3,Dhamma Brothers,The Hobart Shakespeareans,Runaway Bride (Widescreen Edition),Sommersby.Maturity is a farewell to child-self, innocence, total absorption in fantasy. We are each alone, afraid. Everyone is frightened. We hunger for quietness and connection: Yin and Yang of polar opposites, balance on a knife edge which is jiggling. All we have is each other and ourselves5 stars recommended for thoughtful inquiry into the private life of a woman who understands that everyone eventually goes awayDeparturesand we are left with ourselves for self nurturance and comfort, the painful transition to adult responsibility for our own feelings. We may choose sharing our adventure with others, who may walk in parallel with our journey, or not.The specific meaning of God depends on what is the most desirable good for a person.

376141,A1L8HRCM60W0W7,6303467717,Shashank Tripathi,"[8, 15]","One would expect more from Michael Apted than this award hopeful because thematically it's hard not to notice its glaring overlaps with Wild Child or The Elephant Man, its narrative following a tediously hackneyed routine --Civilization discovers Outsider (in our case, a Tarzan-like girl born and brought up in the idyllic North Carolina wilderness); Outsider cannot communicate, speaks in a baroque forest tongue instead; Outsider is taunted, tested, taken advantage of, yet somehow becomes a media sensation and eventually teaches us Grave Important Things.Woven into this predictable tapestry are some choice inanities.The two physicians --(1) A country doctor (Liam Neeson) conveniently oblivious to life's necessities like paying bills, and(2) An institutionally-funded but vacuous shrink (Natasha Richardson) intent on furthering her career by examining Nell through two-way mirrors-- find themselves transformed by the girl's gump-like innocence, realizing in the process the emptiness of their own lives. They need companionship. They need be one with nature. Why not swim in the lake nude under the evening stars, and while you're at it, why not show Nell her first glimpse of male genitalia so she'll no longer be scared of men?Soon, it becomes clear that Nell is ironically the sanest of the three. When they step out of their contended cove into the civilized world (read: a small redneck town) the movie sinks into the labored and sappy. An unbelievable scene toward the end even has Nell defending herself in the courtroom, despite her linguistic stupor through the rest of the film.In all fairness, Jodie Foster is borderline convincing in the bravura title role, and Neeson has his moments. It is these spurts of good acting that help camouflage the narrative's weaknesses somewhat, relying copiously on Spinotti's ravishing cinematography to fill in some logical lapses with rose-colored morning mountains and silvered moonlit lakes.Yet, ultimately, I found myself asking the question, ""Haven't I seen this all before?"", the answer to which was a disappointing, resounding yes.",3,"OSCAR-CRAVING ""WILD CHILD"" IN A LOG CABIN",1100908800,"11 20, 2004",2004,2095,"['One', 'would', 'expect', 'more', 'Michael', 'Apted', 'award', 'hopeful', 'hard', 'not', 'notice', 'glaring', 'overlaps', 'Wild', 'Child', 'Elephant', 'Man', 'narrative', 'following', 'tediously', 'hackneyed', 'routine', 'Civilization', 'discovers', 'Outsider', 'case', 'Tarzan-like', 'girl', 'born', 'brought', 'up', 'idyllic', 'North', 'Carolina', 'wilderness', 'can', 'not', 'communicate', 'speaks', 'baroque', 'forest', 'tongue', 'instead', 'Outsider', 'taunted', 'tested', 'taken', 'advantage', 'somehow', 'media', 'sensation', 'eventually', 'teaches', 'Grave', 'Important', 'Things.Woven', 'predictable', 'tapestry', 'are', 'choice', 'inanities.The', 'two', 'physicians', '1', 'country', 'doctor', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'conveniently', 'oblivious', 'life', 'necessities', 'paying', 'bills', '2', 'institutionally-funded', 'vacuous', 'shrink', 'Natasha', 'Richardson', 'intent', 'furthering', 'career', 'examining', 'Nell', 'two-way', 'mirrors', 'find', 'transformed', 'girl', 'gump-like', 'innocence', 'realizing', 'process', 'emptiness', 'own', 'lives', 'need', 'companionship', 'need', 'be', 'one', 'nature', 'Why', 'not', 'swim', 'lake', 'nude', 'evening', 'stars', ""'re"", 'why', 'not', 'show', 'Nell', 'first', 'glimpse', 'male', 'genitalia', ""'ll"", 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'scared', 'men', 'Soon', 'clear', 'Nell', 'ironically', 'sanest', 'three', 'When', 'step', 'contended', 'cove', 'civilized', 'world', 'read', 'small', 'redneck', 'town', 'movie', 'labored', 'sappy', 'unbelievable', 'scene', 'end', 'even', 'Nell', 'defending', 'courtroom', 'linguistic', 'stupor', 'rest', 'film.In', 'fairness', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'borderline', 'convincing', 'bravura', 'title', 'role', 'Neeson', 'moments', 'spurts', 'good', 'acting', 'help', 'camouflage', 'narrative', 'weaknesses', 'somewhat', 'relying', 'copiously', 'Spinotti', 'ravishing', 'cinematography', 'fill', 'logical', 'lapses', 'rose-colored', 'morning', 'mountains', 'silvered', 'moonlit', 'lakes.Yet', 'ultimately', 'found', 'asking', 'question', 'Have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'answer', 'was', 'disappointing', 'resounding', 'yes']",Nell VHS

In spite of the isolation this girl grew up in and her messed up language due  having her mother (a stroke victim) as her only companion growing up, the  character of Nell is almost a bit too normal. It's a proven fact that  people kept in isolation suffer mental breakdowns, become depressed and  sometimes violent... that is why &quot;solitary confinement&quot; is such a  harsh punishment in jail.The antagonists, Redneck hillbillies and  narrow-minded &quot;know-it-all&quot; psychiatrists, are a bit too  stereotypical and expected.Every once in a while you hear f a  &quot;jungle boy&quot; or other isolated child or young adult found in the  woods somewhere that has survived beyond all odds, foraging for food,  tending their own wounds and living w/o interaction w/other people... but  never do these people survive in mainstream culture in just a couple of  years of being in an institution.Nonetheless, I found this film very  entertaining  and very moving due to the flawless acting by Neeson and  Foster.

They lived together in a cottage in the forest. Nobody has ever met Nell. After her mother's death, she's discovered by the local doctor Jerome. He's fascinated by her, since she speaks a mangled language, developed by her sister and herself growing up, twin speak, if you will. But Paula, a psychology student, wants her observed in a laboratory. The judge decides they get three months to observe her in the forest, after which he'll decide about Nell's future. The most outstanding feature of the movie is Jodie Foster's performance in the title role- a remarkable one even by the standards of this talented actress. What gives this movie its power is not any obvious 'message' but its deeply poetic and spiritual tone, deriving both from the acting of the three central characters and the exquisite photography of the North Carolina landscapes.  This is one of the finest and most powerful movies, that makes it well worth watching.",5,Nell,1266451200,"02 18, 2010",2010,1053,"['Nell', 'girl', 'who', 'been', 'brought', 'up', 'isolated', 'world', 'only', 'people', 'knew', 'were', 'mother', 'twin', 'sister', 'lived', 'together', 'cottage', 'forest', 'Nobody', 'ever', 'met', 'Nell', 'mother', 'death', 'discovered', 'local', 'doctor', 'Jerome', 'fascinated', 'mangled', 'language', 'developed', 'sister', 'growing', 'up', 'twin', 'speak', 'will', 'Paula', 'psychology', 'student', 'observed', 'laboratory', 'judge', 'get', 'three', 'months', 'observe', 'forest', ""'ll"", 'decide', 'Nell', 'future', 'most', 'outstanding', 'feature', 'movie', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'performance', 'title', 'role-', 'remarkable', 'one', 'even', 'standards', 'talented', 'actress', 'What', 'movie', 'power', 'not', 'obvious', ""'message"", 'deeply', 'poetic', 'spiritual', 'tone', 'deriving', 'acting', 'three', 'central', 'characters', 'exquisite', 'photography', 'North', 'Carolina', 'one', 'finest', 'most', 'powerful', 'movies', 'well', 'watching']",Nell VHS

Yes, Jodie Foster is excellent (as usual).The only problem I had with this movie was that at the end in the courtroom, Nell--wary of a lot of people, remember--is able to stand up and deliver a moving, emotional speech before the judge, and ALSO comprehend what everyone in that court was saying to/about her.  Suddenly she wasn't scared or nervous?  On the other hand ... it can be argued that at that very moment her whole life suddenly made sense and her plight became clear.Perhaps the movie, like MANY others, was made so that the viewer can dream up their own interpretation about what REALLY was going on.Jodie Foster received her third Best Actress Oscar nomination for this 1994 performance.  If she had won--and many believed she was going to because it was anybody's game in 94--it would have been her third win in less than 10 years, which is TERRIBLY unprecedented.
