First of all, this movie is extremely racist. Even taking in the time that Griffith lived and the setting of the Civil War, the racism still was over the top. And the movie was dull, though it did get slightly better as it went on. So what you have here is three hours of a boring movie that is extremely racist. I'm just not sure what to make of it.",2,not as great as i was expecting,1081987200,"04 15, 2004",2004,450,"[""'ve"", 'heard', 'lot', 'Griffith', 'movie', 'being', 'important', 'one', 'film', 'history', 'watched', 'First', 'all', 'movie', 'extremely', 'racist', 'Even', 'taking', 'time', 'Griffith', 'lived', 'setting', 'Civil', 'War', 'racism', 'still', 'was', 'top', 'movie', 'was', 'dull', 'did', 'get', 'slightly', 'better', 'went', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'three', 'hours', 'boring', 'movie', 'extremely', 'racist', ""'m"", 'just', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'make']",N/A

Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[4, 6]","Throughout my cinematic life there has always been that one film that both critics and audiences have agreed, both time and again, to be one of the greatest films created.  Upon watching sed film, I was unimpressed.  It was grandiose alright, but a continued classic?  This critic would have to disagree.  The blatant racism, the glossy view of the South, as well as that final line that instead of joy, sends a painful shiver down your spine - that is not the grounds for a film that continues to show up on everyone's top ten lists.  The film, ""Gone With the Wind"", and searching through my older review of it, these words were use ""From the unexciting, unloving characters (of which we all hate, yet are supposed to love by the end) to smile on Scarlett's face after the marital rape scene, this movie was a disaster.""  Now, upon watching D.W. Griffith's brave, bold, and uncensored epic (the word epic CAN be used for this film because it not only details history, but it also carries suspense, love, vengeance, and innocence throughout) ""Birth of a Nation"", it cannot be comprehended as to why this film has not honored with the same praise as that candy-store epic.  It is studied in film classes, it demonstrates the rawest form of both independent production as well as large, scoping scenes involving mass crowds, war, and a final battle sequence that would knock the socks of any modern CGI created moments, yet only in independent forums is it considered the powerhouse it should be.  Could it be that this film feels more racist now than ""Gone with the Wind"" ever did?  Are we afraid to embrace this film because of honest or argumentative vision that Griffith took?""Birth of a Nation"" can rattle any viewer to the core because of both the brazen images that it conjures, but also, made in 1915, it forces the viewer to change the way they watch movies.  There are no spoken words, just the loud notes of the orchestra playing ""Dixie"", or ""Star Spangled Banner"", or just tunes to carry us to the next scene.  This film also depicts the racial tensions of the time rather honestly.  Griffith has been marked a racist for his work on this film, the images of white actors playing African Americans, or the depiction of the power of the Klu Klux Klan can rattle any viewer to the core.  Isn't that the point?  ""Birth of a Nation"" is not only a stronger, more influential film than ""Gone With the Wind"", but it challenges the typical popcorn-to-couch viewer.  One could show similarities between the two films by saying that there are sweeping landscapes and powerful battle scenes in both films, but Griffith takes it a step further by showing us the history of racism, a.k.a. the birth of a fearing nation.  He begins with the Civil War, most specifically two families that were friends prior to the War, but find themselves eventually on dueling sides of the battlefield.  It is this brother-against-brother war that fuels the future events of the South.  Griffith's film also develops the power of Abe Lincoln throughout these times.  It shows his compassion, his desire to unify the country, and to assist in the redevelopment of the South.  This, sadly, gives a further reason as to why his assassination took place, and how the North used this to push the South into further disarray.To modern standards, ""Birth of a Nation"" is racist.  Griffith's depiction of African Americans in the army, voting, and taking office is very difficult to watch in 2008, but there is a moment of truth to his images.  The new rule from the North brought too much power to one particular person, thus destroying any level of equality for this already war-ravished nation.  In the same vein, Griffith's portrayal of the KKK to today's modern standards is also considered racist.  To have an organization, fueled by hatred, be the heroines of the film, is again, difficult to watch in 2008 - but Griffith, I believe, sees this and with that final scene of the KKK demonstrates how they have transformed into an entity of hatred, instead of encouraged by change.  Griffith credits the birth of the KKK as a group that merely wanted to have a voice in the South, a group that wanted to have equality across the board, so in retaliation, they organized, and the KKK was formed.  Having never read ""The Clansmen"", one does question how detailed Griffith went when pulling source material for his film from this book.  Watching how the KKK regains power is necessary to this story, because Griffith is able to take these historically accurate moments and show us where we went wrong.  ""Birth of a Nation"" is a film that points the finger inward, depicting casualties from both the North and South, both white and black, and both rich and poor.  The underlining meaning to ""Birth of a Nation"" is that corruption and evil lurk from all different places and that perhaps the best response isn't the greatest action.Finally, I would like to end this review by expressing my feelings toward this film.  This was an emotional, exhausting, and powerful film to watch.  Why it isn't on everyone's ""Top Ten"" lists is beyond me, outside of the fact that perhaps the depiction of the KKK or African Americans is a bit hard to swallow.  I would agree that this film is racist, but in the context of the time, I think Griffith was right to do what he did to create this masterpiece.  I am not racist myself, but if I had a child, and wanted to show them a darker side to our great nation, this would be the film I would showcase.  Not only does it show racism, but is shows ""why"".  It is a courageous film from its historical basis, but a sad film from its honesty.  Everyone should watch ""Birth of a Nation"", it is a bold entry into not just the world of cinema (the first real epic), but it is one of the few films to really paint a dirty picture of the Civil War.  While we all agree that the Civil War (or any war) is unjust, ""Birth of a Nation"" takes us to next level to show its repercussions.Overall, I initially had trouble training my eyes to watch a non-talking film.  The music was fantastic, the scenes were detailed, and the story captured my attention until the very end.  This was a historical epic - surprisingly, an epic that takes you away from you comfort zone.  It forces you to root for an evil organization, to shake your head at the images of African Americans, and see the corruption of the North (a side we typically see as sympathetic to the cause).  My argument is that this film is a classic - alas, a forgotten classic.  While film schools, film geeks, and non-commercial film literature feels that ""Birth of a Nation"" is considered the ultimate classic, there is a strong majority that fear the message in this film - that fear the images that Griffith has created - thus they push away, and on so many lists of films you will find ""Gone With the Wind"", a glossier, less engaging film.  In conclusion, ""Birth of a Nation"" is exactly what the title describes.  It is the birth of our current society, complete with racism, hatred, confusion, corruption, epic battles, and greed.  It is a film that should be catapulted to the top, not forgotten at the bottom.Grade: ***** out of *****",5,Beware of those skeletons in your closet...,1219622400,"08 25,

Few would deny its profound influence on movie history, but fewer still can watch its loathsome treatment of African Americans with anything less than disgust. For as much as D.W. Griffith's epic helped codify the modern language of filmmaking, its glorification of the Ku Klux Klan as heroes of the Reconstruction era was pretty controversial even upon its release in 1915. Griffith was a man of his time, and a not particularly ideological one at that and yet his masterwork was so skillfully made that it remains a flashpoint of film scholarship -- is it possible to admire, or even enjoy, a film with such an odious message? Kino's lavish three-disc The Birth of a Nation - Special Edition will certainly add to the conversation; in addition to a new transfer of the film, the set features a number of Griffith's short films and plenty of bonus featurettes and documents about the making of the movie and the controversy it caused.

396311,ACTPCV7BMYO8L,630401967X,Alex,"[8, 13]","When this film was made in 1914 and released in 1915, America was a different place, it was a time when whites and blacks were at major odds. This was before the civil rights movement and the harlem renaissance, race riots in southern towns were occuring and horrible hangings. So it is understandable how the racist overtones was happening. The blacks were still seen as igonrent, blind and greedy, as was the abolitionists, who were seen as corrupt. And to the south even as late as the 60s, the KKK were considered heros of the white way. I am not a racist, I hate the KKK, however, when watching what was being depicted on screen, was that I was rooting for the ""Hero"" played Henry B. Walthall. And the KKK, sicking as it may sound that is what made millions of moviegoers call it the greatest movie of all time. It had an exciting edge, to it. It is still the most controversal movie of all time. No other movie in history since has made a movie that showed the blacks in a bad light. And the worst part of it is that it was white actors in black face. I however, got past the sicking racism and was just in awe of what was happening. I am 18 years old. I have seen and loved Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings trilogy, but when I watch this film, just like any other silent film, I put my shoes in to a movie goer from that time period. I did just that with Birth Of A Nation, I pictured my self in a major theater in 1915, seeing only short two reel bit shorts, and sitting there watching the first epic in American history. The second disk is a gem. Particulary the four short D.W Griffth shorts, and a rare interview with the man himself Griffth and Walter Huston in an sound 1938 interview. It was an odd interview.  With Griffth remarking "" Boy you ask a lot of questions"" duh!! But hey give ol D.W his props, he gave our movie grammer.

396313,A2M4R8R6SU049A,630401967X,"Amazon Customer ""too many books, too little time""","[8, 12]","How strange to see this ancient movie, one of the first long narrative films.  It has several different layers to appreciate.  First, the story -- totally heinous by any standards.  This story of the civil war and reconstruction is so racist that it boggles the mind.  And DW Griffith did not consider himself a racist!  So that gives us the second layer -- attitudes of 1915, where a simple proposal of marriage from a racially mixed man was enough to justify his murder.  And who can ever forget the Klan riding ""to the rescue"" to the music of Wagner's Flight of the Valkyries?  Then we come to one other layer -- one that seems to be forgotten at times.  Which is that, as cinema, in that time and place, it is genius.  This man showed us how to do it!

Griffith's politics are utterly disgusting.Griffith was one of the most important innovators in cinema, inventing much of the basic grammar of film. It is impossible to underestimate his technical contributions. Birth of a Nation is his most famous--or rather, infamous--film. It's the first blockbuster in movie history, and it made Griffith a very rich man. It dragged cinema out of the age of the two-reeler and showed the studios that there was a huge market for long films and historical epics. It also inspired (if that's the right word) the revival of the Ku Klux Klan and taught millions of white Americans to hate and fear blacks.But, now that all of Griffith's technical innovations have become utterly commonplace (so commonplace, in fact, that even the most amateurish filmmakers use them without thinking), what's left in Birth of a Nation to enjoy and admire? Well, not much, I'm afraid. Lacking the distinct visionary style of the best silent-era filmmakers (Chaplin, Lang, Stroheim, Murnau, Dreyer, etc.), Griffith's work falls flat. There's nothing here to enchant the eye or exercise the mind, which forces one to concentrate entirely on the content. And what paltry content it is. False, ludicrous melodrama and grimacing, hand-waving performances straight out of some 19th-century traveling stock company's production of East Lynne. Cheesy-looking battle re-enactments. The hoariest old cliches unredeemed by any wit or beauty or intelligence.Judged purely on its artistic merits, Birth of a Nation really rates only one star; but since it occupies an important place in film history, I reluctantly give it two stars. Film geeks should watch it once, just to see how far we've advanced--morally, politically, and cinematically--since Griffith's day.",2,"an important innovator, but not a great artist",1113868800,"04 19, 2005",2005,1858,"['right', 'let', 'get', 'out', 'way', 'first', 'film', 'thoroughly', 'racist', 'D.', 'W.', 'Griffith', 'politics', 'are', 'utterly', 'disgusting.Griffith', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'innovators', 'cinema', 'inventing', 'much', 'basic', 'grammar', 'film', 'impossible', 'underestimate', 'technical', 'contributions', 'Birth', 'Nation', 'most', 'famous', 'rather', 'infamous', 'film', 'first', 'blockbuster', 'movie', 'history', 'made', 'Griffith', 'very', 'rich', 'man', 'dragged', 'cinema', 'age', 'two-reeler', 'showed', 'studios', 'was', 'huge', 'market', 'long', 'films', 'historical', 'epics', 'also', 'inspired', 'right', 'word', 'revival', 'Ku', 'Klux', 'Klan', 'taught', 'millions', 'white', 'Americans', 'hate', 'fear', 'blacks.But', 'now', 'Griffith', 'technical', 'innovations', 'have', 'become', 'utterly', 'commonplace', 'so', 'commonplace', 'fact', 'even', 'most', 'amateurish', 'filmmakers', 'use', 'thinking', 'what', 'left', 'Birth', 'Nation', 'enjoy', 'admire', 'Well', 'not', 'much', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'Lacking', 'distinct', 'visionary', 'style', 'best', 'silent-era', 'filmmakers', 'Chaplin', 'Lang', 'Stroheim', 'Murnau', 'Dreyer', 'etc', 'Griffith', 'work', 'flat', 'nothing', 'here', 'enchant', 'eye', 'exercise', 'mind', 'one', 'concentrate', 'entirely', 'content', 'what', 'paltry', 'content', 'False', 'ludicrous', 'melodrama', 'grimacing', 'hand-waving', 'performances', 'straight', '19th-century', 'traveling', 'stock', 'company', 'production', 'East', 'Lynne', 'Cheesy-looking', 'battle', 're-enactments', 'hoariest', 'old', 'cliches', 'unredeemed', 'wit', 'beauty', 'intelligence.Judged', 'purely', 'artistic', 'merits', 'Birth', 'Nation', 'really', 'rates', 'only', 'one', 'star', 'important', 'place', 'film', 'history', 'reluctantly', 'give', 'two', 'stars', 'Film', 'geeks', 'should', 'watch', 'once', 'just', 'see', 'how', 'far', ""'ve"", 'advanced', 'morally', 'politically', 'cinematically', 'Griffith', 'day']",N/A

The score is not terribly great music, but does fit the action pretty well. However, one Christmas song was used more than once just because it was Christian, not for the season of the year. And toward the end, there's about ten or fifteen minutes of fight scenes which have the same crescendo music over and over, as if each minute was the last of the film.Of course, the film's score is the least of it. The nation which is referenced in the title is the Ku Klux Klan, and the film is essentially a propaganda piece for the Klan. The interesting thing is that the movie does not actually justify the Klan to any degree, although perhaps to a Klansman, it would.The movie curiously mixes real black actors with whites in black face makeup, and I could not detect any particular symbolism. However, the two ""faithful souls"" (slaves of the southern family who stay on as servants after the war) are both apparently whites in make-up. There are two real villains of the piece. The first is a white ""radical"" politician, whose daughter is played by Lillian Gish, and who (predictably) falls in love with a confederate soldier. And just to make it easy to follow, her brother loves his sister. The other really vile character is a ""mulatto"" who is the protege of the radical politician, and betrays both his white side and his black side. He manipulates his way into being elected lieutenant governor of the state (South Carolina, I think), and then tries to force his benefactor's daughter into marriage with him.The radical is a staunch abolitionist, and active in the reconstruction, which is depicted as completely corrupt. At the ballot box, whites are routinely turned away while blacks put extra ballots in the box. A black Yankee soldier (white actor in black face) chases the youngest girl in the southern family and eventually corners her on the top of a large rock outcrop, where she declares she will jump if he makes a move to grab her. He does, and she does. Her brother had been trying to find her to rescue her, but found her only as she was dying, then took her battered body back to the house and stirred up the KKK. Huge numbers of white robed klansmen riding horses which are also covered in white sheets ride to the rescue of a group of people cornered by wild blacks in an isolated cabin, and also bring the captured and apparently killed Yankee soldier who caused the death of the young girl to dump him on the doorstep of the lieutenant governor, and scare a mob of celebrating blacks and carpetbagger whites celebrating in the streets.The movie is racist, not particularly well produced (although this is, after all, the early days of filming, nearly 100 years ago), annoyingly tinted in certain scenes (as was the original), and annoying when it is not boring. It is also over three hours long. Still, if you are interested in the history of film-making or the history of the civil war and reconstruction eras, or in the techniques of propaganda displayed so effectively in this film, do see it. I'm not going to give it any stars, however.

The subject here is the Civil War and Reconstruction; in the last part of the movie the KKK is made out to be the saving force of the ""honorable"" South. Blacks are shown abusing the powers granted them in government and the military after the War in the most blatantly racist terms: they're shiftless, debauched, and ""primitive."" This is bad enough, but when the movie first came out the NAACP pressured Griffith to cut even more racially explicit scenes, which he did (the scenes supposedly included white women being attacked by half-crazed blacks and a ""final solution"" calling for blacks to be sent back to Africa); these scenes have apparently been lost.But despite this stomach-churning point of view, the picture defined what cinema could do: it could tell a unified story of substantial length in a language and style purely its own. The movie was longer than anything else before it, yet the story and action unfold with great rapidity - it doesn't lag for a minute.The movie was shot almost in total secrecy, and Griffith worked without a written script, though it's obviously based on Thomas E. Dixon's novel THE CLANSMAN, with scenes from another Dixon novel, THE LEOPARD'S SPOTS, included (the movie, in fact, opened in LA with that title, THE CLANSMAN, with Griffith changing it a month later when the movie premiered in NYC). The cast was often clueless regarding scenes being filmed and how it was all supposed to add up to a single production. Many before-release predictions were negative, some portending a box-office disaster, but more people ended up seeing this picture during its first year of release than any other movie.As a work of art, the picture is a landmark production. It's truly the birth of narrative film, and filmmakers studied this film for years gleaming ideas, from the use of symbolism to intercutting techniques to employing close-ups. But socially the film produced some very negative repercussions, the most grievous being its connection to the rise of the KKK in the 1920s.

Griffith's ""The Birth of a Nation"" at a special White House screening.Wilson was expressing admiration for both the film and the relatively new technology of the motion picture. Now, ""The Birth of a Nation"" is as much a part of history as the Civil War it dramatized.When Orson Welles made ""Citizen Kane"" in 1941, it is said that he watched many of Griffith's films in the hope of picking up a pointer or two from the man acknowledged as the master of the motion picture medium. With ""The Birth of a Nation,"" Griffith established the narrative approach that is now the norm for motion pictures, with cross-cutting of scenes, as well as close-ups, used to tell the story.Griffith's masterwork was the first motion picture ""event,"" unequaled until ""Gone With the Wind"" twenty-four years later. With a running time of 100 minutes in an era when movies were typically half that length, the $2.00 admission charged by theaters was also heftier than audiences of the day were accustomed to.Historically, the importance of Griffith and ""The Birth of a Nation"" can not be disputed, but it's doubtful many modern viewers can appreciate Griffith's achievement in anything but its historical context.It remains the subject of heated controversy for its glowing portrayal of the Ku Klux Klan, which some critics suggest should disqualify Griffith from consideration as a motion picture pioneer. That's nonsense, of course, and those who continue to vilify Griffith and his film, however justly, are doing their cause a disservice. If not for the controversy, ""The Birth of a Nation"" would likely find an audience only in academia where even film students would likely find it heavy going.In the decades since Griffith's film impressed Woodrow Wilson, we have become impressed to the point of indifference.

396326,A3M5UGU0NGD38D,630401967X,Casey62,"[3, 3]","D.W. Griffith's sprawling, innovative epic about America's Civil War and Reconstruction will soon be 100 years old. When Griffith made this film in 1915, the events it depicts happened half a century before and the generation that witnessed them was still alive. That says a lot in favor of the film's honest portrayal of those events, but doesn't reflect too well on the ongoing controversy surrounding it that's lasted to this day.You'd think we'd become more enlightened over the past 100 years and get over the film's prejudiced views which, after all, were commonplace in the 1860's and, despite our pretending otherwise, still exist to varying degrees today. If Griffith's depiction of the Ku-Klux-Klan as heroic defenders of virginal maidens outrages modern viewers, remember that many post-Civil War southerners viewed the Klan that way. Griffith was only being true to the era when he made THE BIRTH, and to do otherwise would've been a gross misrepresentation of history, the kind we get in movies made nowadays where political correctness becomes more important than accurate depictions of historical accounts.The foregoing should be considered by anyone watching this film today because it'll help in appreciating Griffith's uncompromising stand which is part of what makes THE BIRTH OF A NATION such a great film. Think about it: If every filmmaker was more concerned about the sentiments of his audience than about presenting the truthfulness of his subject - no matter how unpleasant that truth is to modern viewers - ignorance would prevail. It's a risk for a filmmaker to do this, a risk Griffith took that has tarnished his celebrated reputation as the Father of American Film, but left us a work of cinematic art that serves as a grim reminder of our country's heritage.And so for us today, what should matter in the end is THE BIRTH OF A NATION itself, a brilliant film that still stands as a monumental achievement in motion picture history, and Kino's magnificently restored edition preserves all its splendor; from the meticulous attention to detail in sets and costumes, to the sweeping spectacle of the battle scenes, and to the suspenseful re-enactment of Lincoln's assassination. THE BIRTH OF A NATION presents it all in a way that really hasn't been quite as authentic in any movie since.

It's hard today for people to get past the film's politics but the passions it arouses obscure its many accomplishments. It has also cast director D.W. Griffith in a very narrow light which undeservedly negates the rest of his career. Before BIRTH, Griffith was considered a progressive filmmaker who tackled serious social issues such as corporate greed (THE CORNER IN WHEAT), drug addiction (FOR HIS SON), treatment of the elderly (WHAT SHALL WE DO WITH OUR OLD?), abuse of Native Americans (THE REDMAN'S VIEW), and even an anti-Klan film (THE ROSE OF KENTUCKY). After BIRTH he did INTOLERANCE, BROKEN BLOSSOMS (mixed race relationship), ABRAHAM LINCOLN, and THE STRUGGLE (alcoholism). There were other epics, potboilers, and misfires but to judge Griffith on the basis of one controversial film seems unfair. It would be like judging Steven Spielberg for THE COLOR PURPLE and nothing else. Taking his name off the DGA award without a vote from DGA membership smacks of political correctness, a gesture that Griffith, who was a long time opponent of censorship, would have found all too familiar.Be that as it may, THE BIRTH OF A NATION remains his signature film and it represents a giant leap forward in the development of the motion picture technically if not thematically. When adjusted for inflation it is one of the most successful movies of all time although once sound arrived, very few people have seen it. It takes a theme which has been recycled many times about two families on opposite sides of a conflict and tells it in a very effective manner. The movie is divided into 2 parts. Part 1 starts before the Civil War and ends with Lincoln's assassination. If Griffith had stopped there the film would have been 90 minutes long and there would be no controversy. It is Part 2, Reconstruction, that contains the racially inflammatory material and the origins and glorification of the Ku Klux Klan. This is where the Reverend Thomas W. Dixon's book and play THE CLANSMAN (the film's original title) takes over and his racist message is hammered home. Yet this was the prevailing view of Reconstruction at the time as historically expounded by the Dunning School (named after a professor at Columbia University) and one that was not fully discredited until the rise of the Civil Rights movement in the early 1960s.For years BIRTH OF A NATION could only be seen in substandard public domain prints that were heavily and very badly edited and that were projected at the wrong speed (too fast). It wasn't until the start of the video era that a visual approximation of what Griffith intended could finally be seen. Also made available was the original Joseph Breil music that was composed for the film in 1915. Curiously the 2011 restoration, featured on the Blu-Ray, does not use this score. While there's nothing wrong with the new Mont Alto Orchestra score, the lack of period melodies and Civil War tunes that are found in the original robs the film of some of its emotional impact. Fortunately the 1993 restoration by Film Preservation Associates which features the Breil score is available as a DVD with this set. Compare the two scores and see what you think. Make sure you check out David Shepard's short feature on the making of the movie. A third available disc shows several of Griffith's Biograph Civil War shorts. When you view BIRTH, make sure you watch all 3 hours so that you can experience the overall scope and design of the film. Also of historical interest are the two 1930 introductions on the Blu-Ray that feature Griffith and Walter Huston.",5,Still Controversial After 100 Years...,1389225600,"01 9, 2014",2014,3713,"['will', 'still', 'be', 'controversial', '100', 'years', 'now', 'film', 'history', 'cinema', 'can', 'make', 'claim', 'plenty', 'would', 'like', 'hard', 'today', 'people', 'get', 'film', 'politics', 'passions', 'many', 'accomplishments', 'also', 'cast', 'director', 'D.W.', 'Griffith', 'very', 'narrow', 'light', 'undeservedly', 'rest', 'career', 'BIRTH', 'Griffith', 'was', 'considered', 'progressive', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'tackled', 'serious', 'social', 'issues', 'such', 'corporate', 'greed', 'CORNER', 'IN', 'WHEAT', 'drug', 'addiction', 'HIS', 'SON', 'treatment', 'elderly', 'WHAT', 'SHALL', 'WE', 'DO', 'WITH', 'OUR', 'OLD', 'abuse', 'Native', 'Americans', 'THE', 'REDMAN', 'VIEW', 'even', 'anti-Klan', 'film', 'THE', 'ROSE', 'OF', 'KENTUCKY', 'BIRTH', 'did', 'INTOLERANCE', 'BROKEN', 'BLOSSOMS', 'mixed', 'race', 'relationship', 'ABRAHAM', 'LINCOLN', 'THE', 'STRUGGLE', 'alcoholism', 'were', 'other', 'epics', 'potboilers', 'misfires', 'judge', 'Griffith', 'basis', 'one', 'controversial', 'film', 'unfair', 'would', 'be', 'judging', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'THE', 'COLOR', 'PURPLE', 'nothing', 'else', 'Taking', 'name', 'DGA', 'award', 'vote', 'DGA', 'membership', 'smacks', 'political', 'correctness', 'gesture', 'Griffith', 'who', 'was', 'long', 'time', 'opponent', 'censorship', 'would', 'have', 'found', 'too', 'familiar.Be', 'may', 'THE', 'BIRTH', 'A', 'NATION', 'signature', 'film', 'giant', 'leap', 'forward', 'development', 'motion', 'picture', 'technically', 'not', 'thematically', 'When', 'adjusted', 'inflation', 'one', 'most', 'successful', 'movies', 'time', 'once', 'sound', 'arrived', 'very', 'few', 'people', 'have', 'seen', 'theme', 'been', 'recycled', 'many', 'times', 'two', 'families', 'opposite', 'sides', 'conflict', 'very', 'effective', 'manner', 'movie', 'divided', '2', 'parts', 'Part', '1', 'starts', 'Civil', 'War', 'Lincoln', 'assassination', 'Griffith', 'had', 'stopped', 'there', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', '90', 'minutes', 'long', 'there', 'would', 'be', 'controversy', 'Part', '2', 'Reconstruction', 'racially', 'inflammatory', 'material', 'origins', 'glorification', 'Ku', 'Klux', 'Klan', 'where', 'Reverend', 'Thomas', 'W.', 'Dixon', 'book', 'play', 'THE', 'CLANSMAN', 'film', 'original', 'title', 'racist', 'message', 'hammered', 'home', 'was', 'prevailing', 'view', 'Reconstruction', 'time', 'historically', 'expounded', 'Dunning', 'School', 'named', 'professor', 'Columbia', 'University', 'one', 'was', 'not', 'fully', 'discredited', 'rise', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'movement', 'early', '1960s.For', 'years', 'BIRTH', 'A', 'NATION', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'seen', 'substandard', 'public', 'domain', 'prints', 'were', 'heavily', 'very', 'badly', 'edited', 'were', 'projected', 'wrong', 'speed', 'too', 'fast', 'was', ""n't"", 'start', 'video', 'era', 'visual', 'approximation', 'what', 'Griffith', 'intended', 'could', 'finally', 'be', 'seen', 'Also', 'made', 'available', 'was', 'original', 'Joseph', 'Breil', 'music', 'was', 'composed', 'film', '1915', 'Curiously', '2011', 'restoration', 'featured', 'Blu-Ray', 'not', 'use', 'score', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'new', 'Mont', 'Alto', 'Orchestra', 'score', 'lack', 'period', 'melodies', 'Civil', 'War', 'tunes', 'are', 'found', 'original', 'robs', 'film', 'emotional', 'impact', 'Fortunately', '1993', 'restoration', 'Film', 'Preservation', 'Associates', 'Breil', 'score', 'available', 'DVD', 'set', 'Compare', 'two', 'scores', 'see', 'what', 'think', 'Make', 'sure', 'check', 'out', 'David', 'Shepard', 'short', 'feature', 'making', 'movie', 'third', 'available', 'disc', 'several', 'Griffith', 'Biograph', 'Civil', 'War', 'shorts', 'When', 'view', 'BIRTH', 'make', 'sure', 'watch', '3', 'hours', 'so', 'can', 'experience', 'overall', 'scope', 'design', 'film', 'Also', 'historical', 'interest', 'are', 'two', '1930', 'introductions', 'Blu-Ray', 'feature', 'Griffith', 'Walter', 'Huston']",N/A

In the early 1900's, when the Confederacy was still in living memory, nostalgia for that lost time was greater.Unfortunately, a creeping clawback of civil rights and an insidious racism marked the early 20th century, with Birth of a Nation leading the way.  Apparently de Mille was oblivious to the overt racism protrayed in his film.  Perhaps he really did consider the Ku Klux Klan to be like the cavalry riding to the rescue of the old South.  To modern eyes, however, this film is racist to the point of unwatchability.  Most viewers - of any ethnicity - will find the film's content highly offensive, especially the latter half featuring freed slaves trying to rape white girls, attacking white settlers, and a lynching by the KKK.  That the black characters are played by white actors in blackface makes the portrayal all the more offensive.  However, I'm not sure that the racism in Birth of a Nation is worse than in many westerns that were filmed much later - it's certainly more maligned but is that just because there is no Native American equivalent of the NAACP?And yet.... what is astonishing about the film is how well the quality holds up today.  Sure, it's in B&W;, sure there's no sound, but the form and compositions of shots is very like a modern film.  Many parts are surprisingly effective, especially when showing the personal sacrifice of families who have sent their sons off to war, and the devastating scenes of Sherman's March.And so, I have to recommend this movie to students of film.  I also recommend it to students of history - racism cannot be defeated by ignoring it.  It must be confronted, and this film serves a useful purpose even today.

But I was pleasantly surprised when the film drew me in.  Considering it was made in 1915, the film is a technological and artisitic marvel.  The editing in this film was a major step forward for the art of filmmaking.  Lincoln's assassination scene was particularly suspenseful.  I was sitting on the edge of my seat even though I knew what was coming.I became very uncomfortable during the last half of the film.

I had to keep reminding myself that this film was made in 1915, only three years after the Titanic sank.  Griffith takes risks and blazes trails at such an early date.What is also important to consider is that this film was made when a good deal of the cast, as well as the audience watching it had lived through Reconstruction.  It reminds us how deeply divided the nation was even 50 years after Appamatox.  This presentation is hardly balanced -- the cartoonish portrayal of the non-sympathetic charaters is so brazen the film is rendered preachy and heavy-handed, if not laughable.  It is important to note the roots of fear that this film highlights -- mulattos are the dregs of society and miscegenation is the greatest evil imaginable.  It's amazing to see how deeply racist the world-view is here, again reminiscent of Nazi propaganda.The making of documentary is hardly enlightening.  It does provide some look into the production itself, but very little comment is made on the social and ethical context here.

Carter ""The Marching Bugler""","[2, 2]","Leaving reviews of the film's merits to others who cover it thoroughly in their reviews, I will simply say that Disc 2 (the 1993 restoration) is the one you should watch, not Disc 1 with the 2011 restoration.  The reason is that the 1993 version orchestrates the original 1915 score, but the 2011 version consists of new, bland elevator muzak completely detached emotionally from what is happening on the screen.For example, take the assassination scene.  The 1915/1993 version aptly plays Hail to the Chief as Lincoln enters his balcony at Ford's Theater.  The 2011 music, on the other hand, lightly plays a generic trumpet fanfare.  In addition, the entire assassination scene provides tense music appropriate to what is about to happen, but the score for the 2011 version is in a world of its own.  This difference in mood is true throughout the whole movie.  If you played the 2011 disc as background music without watching the movie, you wouldn't be able to recognize what type of scene was showing because the mood never changes from one of meaningless boppitty-ness.Of course, the 2011 print boasts of being ""newly mastered in HD from archival 35mm elements""; but, the 1993 print by David Shepard is already sharply restored.  There is no need to suffer through the boring music in the 2011 version for the sake of picture quality.  Music can make or break a movie (think West Side Story). The music ""compiled and performed by"" the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra completely sabotages the work done to the 2011 restoration.Aside from the music, I wish they had left the film in its original black and white rather than color tinting some scenes.  Unfortunately, this is done on both discs, 1993 and 2011 (though I think 2011 was worse).  You never know if a scene will be in B&W; or if they'll decide to color it red or pink or green or sepia.  It was distracting.That said, the movie is historically important and I recommend this edition because it has the full length movie at just a little over 3 hours.  Also, Disc 3 has good extras and Disc 2 has a ""Making Of"" documentary (24 min.).

While that is certainly true in a general way, it might also be something of an oversimplification.It really is almost like two different movies. The first part, which takes place in the era before and during the Civil War, contains little objectionable material, and it deserves praise both technically and for the acting. The second part, set in the reconstruction era, contains almost all of the disturbing material, and it also is really not all that great in terms of cinematic quality.Then also, the degree to which ""The Birth of a Nation"" may have influenced the development of cinema has very likely been overstated . The controversy that it generated may very well have helped it to remain better known than other films of the era that were equally innovative and/or lavish, or nearly so.If the movie had ended shortly after the memorable and well-crafted Ford's Theater scene, the anti-war sentiment and similar themes would remain the main focus, since the effects of war on families and individuals is depicted convincingly and thoughtfully. In that case, its occasional lapses would possibly at the worst be called ""dated"", given the quality of the rest of this part of the movie.The second half, though, is completely unfortunate in almost every respect. Not only does it promote a distorted viewpoint, but the story becomes labored, and the characters lose their depth and become more one-dimensional. The purely technical side, such as the photography and the use of cross-cutting, might still be good, but much of the rest of it loses its effectiveness.Perhaps more importantly, it really seems rather difficult to justify the credit that this one film gets in the development of cinema. There had already been numerous feature-length movies, and most of the techniques that Griffith used were also in use by others. He may well have been ahead of the pack in terms of appreciating their possibilities, but that does not mean that cinema would not have developed as it did without this particular movie.Just as one example, the Italian epic ""Cabiria"", from the previous year, has the same kind of lavish scale, is quite resourceful in its techniques, and is quite entertaining, without causing so much controversy.Other early feature-length films also include some creative efforts to adapt film-making techniques to longer running times and more complex stories. Finally, many short features from the pre-Griffith era experimented with the same kinds of techniques that he later would use systematically. There's no denying Griffith's considerable technical skill, but others of the era also deserve some credit, even if they and their works were less controversial, and are now largely forgotten as a result.",5,The Birth of an Art Form,1227052800,"11 19, 2008",2008,2954,"['conventional', 'wisdom', 'Birth', 'Nation', 'impressive', 'innovative', 'display', 'cinematic', 'skill', 'was', 'unfortunately', 'wasted', 'story', 'bizarre', 'disturbing', 'point', 'view', 'certainly', 'true', 'general', 'way', 'might', 'also', 'be', 'something', 'oversimplification.It', 'really', 'almost', 'like', 'two', 'different', 'movies', 'first', 'part', 'place', 'era', 'Civil', 'War', 'little', 'objectionable', 'material', 'praise', 'technically', 'acting', 'second', 'part', 'set', 'reconstruction', 'era', 'almost', 'disturbing', 'material', 'also', 'really', 'not', 'great', 'terms', 'cinematic', 'quality.Then', 'also', 'degree', 'Birth', 'Nation', 'may', 'have', 'influenced', 'development', 'cinema', 'very', 'likely', 'been', 'overstated', 'controversy', 'generated', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'have', 'helped', 'remain', 'better', 'known', 'other', 'films', 'era', 'were', 'equally', 'innovative', 'and/or', 'lavish', 'nearly', 'so.If', 'movie', 'had', 'ended', 'shortly', 'memorable', 'well-crafted', 'Ford', 'Theater', 'scene', 'anti-war', 'sentiment', 'similar', 'themes', 'would', 'remain', 'main', 'focus', 'effects', 'war', 'families', 'individuals', 'depicted', 'convincingly', 'thoughtfully', 'case', 'occasional', 'lapses', 'would', 'possibly', 'worst', 'be', 'called', 'dated', 'given', 'quality', 'rest', 'part', 'movie.The', 'second', 'half', 'completely', 'unfortunate', 'almost', 'respect', 'Not', 'only', 'promote', 'distorted', 'viewpoint', 'story', 'labored', 'characters', 'lose', 'depth', 'become', 'more', 'one-dimensional', 'purely', 'technical', 'side', 'such', 'photography', 'use', 'cross-cutting', 'might', 'still', 'be', 'good', 'much', 'rest', 'effectiveness.Perhaps', 'more', 'importantly', 'really', 'rather', 'difficult', 'justify', 'credit', 'one', 'film', 'development', 'cinema', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'numerous', 'feature-length', 'movies', 'most', 'techniques', 'Griffith', 'used', 'were', 'also', 'use', 'others', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'ahead', 'pack', 'terms', 'appreciating', 'possibilities', 'not', 'mean', 'cinema', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'developed', 'did', 'particular', 'movie.Just', 'one', 'example', 'Italian', 'epic', 'Cabiria', 'previous', 'year', 'same', 'kind', 'lavish', 'scale', 'quite', 'resourceful', 'techniques', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'causing', 'so', 'much', 'controversy.Other', 'early', 'feature-length', 'films', 'also', 'include', 'creative', 'efforts', 'adapt', 'film-making', 'techniques', 'longer', 'running', 'times', 'more', 'complex', 'stories', 'Finally', 'many', 'short', 'features', 'pre-Griffith', 'era', 'experimented', 'same', 'kinds', 'techniques', 'later', 'would', 'use', 'systematically', 'denying', 'Griffith', 'considerable', 'technical', 'skill', 'others', 'era', 'also', 'deserve', 'credit', 'even', 'works', 'were', 'less', 'controversial', 'are', 'now', 'largely', 'forgotten', 'result']",N/A

The fact that there is probably some historical grain of truth is enough to validate this film as a period film of great importance to American history. By comparison, I sincerely doubt that other civil war era epics such as ""Gettysburg"", ""Glory"", and ""Gone with the Wind"" are entirely accurate in every detail either, yet we use them as educational tools and not just pure entertainment.Americans typically prefer their history to be romanticized to a large degree and I feel that this will always be the case.

Many Hollywood films of the day were about the Civil War and the human stories of that war.  Griffth was a son of a Confederate Colonel from that war.  He had deep feelings and beliefs from his family hertiage.  1915 was the 50th Annivserary of the ending of the Civil War.  Many Civil War veterans were still alive and like Spielbergs &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; the veterans were dying at a very high rate so this was a vehicle to launch a Classic Epic movie of rememberence.  The first of such a film that changed the world, film making and censorship forever.DW Griffith chose the 1906 book &quot;The Clansman&quot; by Rev. Thomas Dixon Jr.  Actually up to the final premier date Griffith was using the book title finally and wisely chose a new title &quot;Birth of a Nation&quot;.Summary: Story is about the abolishment of slavery in America.  The southern sanction refused to follow suit so state cessation occurs.  &quot;Birth of a Nation&quot; takes us through the Civil War, President Lincolns assaination, to the Reconstruction, Carpetbaggers and the  conception of the Klu Klux Klan.  This is brillantly done by Griffiths vision of the viewer observing through the eyes of the northern family the &quot;Stonemans&quot; and the southern family the &quot;Camerons&quot;.  We follow there lives through this complex web of controversy.To understand the scope of this epic you must understand the world of 1915 and the people who lived then.  That this movie toured the world for 2 years in all the top theatres getting up to $2.00 a ticket.  Can you imagine that???  People were only making as little as 5 cents an hour wages.  A 24 minute &quot;Making of Birth of a Nation&quot; is quite helpful in understanding this time and its people.  I recommend you watch this 24 minute clip first.

396347,A2C7BOQVFH1HLE,630401967X,Frederick Baptist,"[15, 54]","A French saying goes: ""The more things change, the more they stay the same.""  It appears that the ""historical"" epic film of yesteryear is still much like that of today in that ""poetic"" license is taken to the extreme in passing outright lies and fabrications as truth.  One of the things that really turned my stomach watching this is D W Griffith's emphasis at least twice during the film that he did not intend to offend any race but wanted to show historical events and yet goes on to portray outright falsehoods as truth.Firstly, we all know that this Cameron dude did not start the KKK and that this organisation has its roots in Indiana and not South Carolina.  Secondly, the KKK is not the defender of the South and there is no need to ""purify"" the race as is portrayed here the exact words used by D W is ""preserve the Aryan race.""  Modern science, using cutting edge DNA research has already proved that we all come from the same African man about 60,000 years ago and so any racial distinctions are not only ethically wrong but factually wrong as well.  Like it or not, we are all related and separated only by about 2000 generations despite our seemingly outward physical differences and have a common ancestor.  Some of the portrayals of Blacks as alcoholics and white women predators with behaviours more akin to monkeys I found extremely revolting and shocking and leaves me completely unsurprised that riots and lynchings quickly followed the screenings of this movie.Yes, this movie may have been the first feature length movie that used a number of novel techniques but does this excuse the content?  This is not akin to an Einstein discovering relativity folks; every single ""good"" thing about this movie would have been ""discovered/invented"" with or without D W. eventually and very probably very soon after.  Every one of the techniques used would have eventually been used by any of the later, talented directors of the time.  The overall lies, attempts to justify racism and the murderous KKK more than make this film fit for the dust bin than for immortality in movie's great hall of fame.They say that racists are not born but bred; this is why I'm not at all surprised at what D W Griffith has done here.  His father was considered a ""hero"" of the Confederate Army where he served as a Colonel.  I'm sure as a bitter loser of the great war, he must have taught his son his belief system and how to be a great racist.  This movie has not been preserved all that well with many scenes being either too bright or too dark and the soundtrack is too loud and it's quite irritating to have to keep hearing Mendelssohn's overtures over and over again.In conclusion, the question this movie raises is does freedom of expression mean it's okay to make a mockery of history to further a racist directors' world view?  Also, do you buy the fact that just because this is the first movie that's longer than an hour mean that this should be revered for all time despite its extremely offensive and destructive message?  Like I said before none of the ""techniques"" that this film claims to have ""discovered"" are earth-shattering discoveries that would have required a genius to uncover anyway.  So the bottom line is we have here an extremely racist and hate-inducing film that caused a lot more damage than good; D W Griffith's legacy/mess.",1,"The Most Hate-Inducing, Racist Film Ever!",1161475200,"10 22, 2006",2006,3352,"['French', 'saying', 'more', 'things', 'change', 'more', 'stay', 'same', 'historical', 'epic', 'film', 'yesteryear', 'still', 'much', 'today', 'poetic', 'license', 'taken', 'extreme', 'passing', 'outright', 'lies', 'fabrications', 'truth', 'One', 'things', 'really', 'turned', 'stomach', 'watching', 'D', 'W', 'Griffith', 'emphasis', 'least', 'twice', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'intend', 'offend', 'race', 'wanted', 'show', 'historical', 'events', 'yet', 'portray', 'outright', 'falsehoods', 'truth.Firstly', 'know', 'Cameron', 'dude', 'did', 'not', 'start', 'KKK', 'organisation', 'roots', 'Indiana', 'not', 'South', 'Carolina', 'Secondly', 'KKK', 'not', 'defender', 'South', 'need', 'purify', 'race', 'portrayed', 'here', 'exact', 'words', 'used', 'D', 'W', 'preserve', 'Aryan', 'race', 'Modern', 'science', 'using', 'cutting', 'edge', 'DNA', 'research', 'already', 'proved', 'come', 'same', 'African', 'man', '60,000', 'years', 'ago', 'so', 'racial', 'distinctions', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'ethically', 'wrong', 'factually', 'wrong', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'are', 'related', 'separated', 'only', '2000', 'generations', 'seemingly', 'outward', 'physical', 'differences', 'have', 'common', 'ancestor', 'portrayals', 'Blacks', 'alcoholics', 'white', 'women', 'predators', 'behaviours', 'more', 'akin', 'monkeys', 'found', 'extremely', 'revolting', 'shocking', 'completely', 'unsurprised', 'riots', 'lynchings', 'quickly', 'followed', 'screenings', 'movie.Yes', 'movie', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'first', 'feature', 'length', 'movie', 'used', 'number', 'novel', 'techniques', 'excuse', 'content', 'not', 'akin', 'Einstein', 'discovering', 'relativity', 'folks', 'single', 'good', 'thing', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'discovered/invented', 'D', 'W.', 'eventually', 'very', 'probably', 'very', 'soon', 'one', 'techniques', 'used', 'would', 'have', 'eventually', 'been', 'used', 'later', 'talented', 'directors', 'time', 'overall', 'lies', 'attempts', 'justify', 'racism', 'murderous', 'KKK', 'more', 'make', 'film', 'fit', 'dust', 'bin', 'immortality', 'movie', 'great', 'hall', 'fame.They', 'say', 'racists', 'are', 'not', 'born', 'bred', 'why', ""'m"", 'not', 'surprised', 'what', 'D', 'W', 'Griffith', 'done', 'here', 'father', 'was', 'considered', 'hero', 'Confederate', 'Army', 'where', 'served', 'Colonel', ""'m"", 'sure', 'bitter', 'loser', 'great', 'war', 'must', 'have', 'taught', 'son', 'belief', 'system', 'how', 'be', 'great', 'racist', 'movie', 'not', 'been', 'preserved', 'well', 'many', 'scenes', 'being', 'too', 'bright', 'too', 'dark', 'soundtrack', 'too', 'loud', 'quite', 'irritating', 'have', 'keep', 'hearing', 'Mendelssohn', 'overtures', 'again.In', 'conclusion', 'question', 'movie', 'freedom', 'expression', 'mean', 'okay', 'make', 'mockery', 'history', 'further', 'racist', 'directors', 'world', 'view', 'Also', 'do', 'buy', 'fact', 'just', 'first', 'movie', 'longer', 'hour', 'mean', 'should', 'be', 'revered', 'time', 'extremely', 'offensive', 'destructive', 'message', 'said', 'none', 'techniques', 'film', 'have', 'discovered', 'are', 'earth-shattering', 'discoveries', 'would', 'have', 'required', 'genius', 'uncover', 'anyway', 'bottom', 'line', 'have', 'here', 'extremely', 'racist', 'hate-inducing', 'film', 'caused', 'lot', 'more', 'damage', 'good', 'D', 'W', 'Griffith', 'legacy/mess']",N/A
396348,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,630401967X,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[1, 1]","D.W. Griffith did not create such techniques as cross cutting or close ups, but he did consolidate their use in an unexpectedly epic tale of war, defeat, and social chaos--and in consequence the 1915 film THE BIRTH OF A NATION is arguably the first great masterpiece of cinematic art.  Unfortunately, the content of the film was extremely controversial, and that controversy has only intensified with time.The plot is straight forward.  Two families, one from the north and one from the south, have a fast friendship that is disrupted by the Civil War.  The war itself is portrayed in remarkably powerful cinematic terms.  During the defeat and most particularly after the war, the Southern family endures the inevitable swirl of social chaos that inevitably follows such a massive upheaval; the Northern family is torn between sympathy and the self-righteousness of victory; and the newly freed slaves are easily manipulated.  On the surface, this would seem a reasonable story--but the devil is in the details.  Before the war, slaves are shown as mindless, happy-go-lucky creatures; following the war they become rabid, sex-crazed beasts whose extremes are encouraged by the victorious north.  To describe the portrayal as inflammatory would a profound understatement, and modern audiences typically respond with embarrassed and ultimately outraged laughter.Part of the issue here is that most of the black characters are portrayed by white actors wearing ""black face.""  Director D.W. Griffith later defended this by stating that he did indeed cast black actors as much as possible, but that it was simply impossible to find many black actors in California at the time the film was made--and this aside, the film was made in an era when it was considered acceptable for white actors to play such roles in black face.  There is some truth to these statements, but that does not make the result more acceptable.  Part of the issue here is the on-going idea that slavery as such ""was not all that bad,"" that slaves were by and large happy with their lot, and that they demonstrated an unfitness for freedom by the manner in which they were ""easily duped"" by northern agitators.  There is some truth to the idea that newly freed slaves, uneducated and uncertain in their freedom, were easily manipulated--but this manipulation came not only from Northern victors, but from defeated Southerners as well.  And common sense should dispose of the notion that slavery, even under the best of circumstances, was not all that bad and that slaves were happy with their lot.  What normal person could be content in such circumstances?Two sequences in the film are so extreme in their portrayal that modern audiences are typically left aghast.  In the first of these, a white teenage girl (Mae Marsh) is pursued by a newly freed slave who wants to marry a white woman and has her in mind.  To escape him she throws herself off a cliff.  In the second of these, a group of white people are trapped in a house by a rabid horde of newly-freed slaves.  Fortunately, the Klux Klux Klan rides to their rescue.  Ironically, both of these sequences are among the most cinematically exciting moments in the film, showing Griffith's talents for cross-cutting action, editing, and cinematography at their zenith.Adding to the endless internal issues of the film, BIRTH OF A NATION is also a lightening rod for revisionist thinking on both sides of the coin.  Some historians have most specifically condemned the film for its portrayal of Reconstruction, a period they themselves consider remarkably progressive.  But this really depends on what you define as progressive: it was indeed progressive for black men to hold office in the South, but it was hardly progressive for the North to essentially rape the region in order to accomplish it--and in the process both guarantee its failure and the advent of the terrorist Klux Klux Klan.  Defenders of the film are equally flawed in their thinking when they note that the film was well within mainstream thought at the time of its release and should be judged by the standards of its era rather than the standards of present day--completely ignoring the fact that BIRTH OF A NATION was accused of radical racism from the very moment it first arrived on movie screens and was actually more often picketed and boycotted in its own era than it is today.  And these are only two of the many, many odd ideas that swirl around the film.  There are simply too many to list.When all is said and done, BIRTH OF A NATION is an important film, for the techniques it fuses essentially creates the modern language of cinema.  It also contains a number of memorable performances, with Mae Marsh and Lillian Ish only two cases in point.  At the same time, however, it is a remarkably silly film and very often distasteful one in its presentation of ideas that should have been considered antiquated even at the time it was made.  I think the film should be studied: cinema students can learn much from it; historians of all stripe will find it endlessly useful in studying mores of the era in which it was created; civil rights advocates will find it important to the history of the cause--after all, the NAACP was virtually created in response to the film's absurdities; and it is so extreme in content that it is actually a very powerful, if entirely accidental, condemnation of racism.  But unless you fall into one of these categories, you would probably do better to leave the film alone.

396352,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,630401967X,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[4, 5]","This film has the unique distinction of being one of the most technically innovative films ever made, and also one of the most disgustingly racist pictures ever made.Techincally, the film is astounding. The film runs 3 hours (in some early versions, it reportedly ran 3 1/2 hours), and most silent films during that time were 2 reelers (running 20 minutes or so, as a reel of film was roughly 10 minutes). D.W. Griffith pushed the envelope in encompassing more and more in film, treating it with respect and saying, quite rightly, that it was an art form in itself and that it would replace books as history (the latter part of that statement is debatable, but not the first).  The cutting here of wide shots to close ups, pretty standard editing nowadays, was considered revolutionary when D.W. started it. The film was a true epic. It played in many huge theaters, and was treated like a night at the opera. It made people sit up and notice that film was a true art form. I think people were so moved by it because it was a spectactular film, filled with great battle scenes and epic scope, which had never been attempted before. As a historical document, it's incalcuable.As for the thematic elements, the stories you've heard about this films unbridled racism are all true. Blacks (played by whites in black face, which is offensive enough) are portrayed in the most unflattering, disgusting stereotypes that they've been subjected to. One of the slaves, Gus, lusts after one of the Cameron daughters (Gus is portrayed as someone who can't control himself with the white women, which is reprehensible). She ends up killing herself than being with a black man. After blacks receive their emancipation, they start harassing whites, and the KKK comes in to ""save"" white civilization.  This film is the only film that I know of that portrays the KKK in a positive light.  Some of the intertitles are so outrageous that you are really shocked to see them (one reads ""people come together in defense of their Aryan birthright""). People were naturally offended by this, and it can't be dismissed as political correctness (this was 1917, where there was no term for political correctness).  The NAACP despised this film back when it was made, and protested it vigorously.  Griffith defended his film, even saying in an interview that the Klan was needed in those days (I saw this interview on an early VHS copy of the film).  If Griffith was trying to convince people to be nicer to him, saying that about the Klan wasn't helpful.  Considering the Klan is one of the most heinous organizations in American history, it was historically incorrect and from a human standpoint, outrageous.It is difficult to seperate the sheer scope and innovations of this film from its disgusting and incredibly false portrayal of black people. So, do I think people should see this film? Yes, but keep in mind that you will be infuriated by the end. I can't seriously expect anyone to sit through a film like this and not be outraged by the stereotypical, ugly, and racist way blacks are depicted. It's just impossible to do. But if you can somehow appreciate the epic story and the great camerawork, editing, and the like, you may get something out of it.Griffith's next film was Intolerance, perhaps an atonement for his portrayal of blacks here. It's another technical marvel, but one that ended up bankrupting Griffith.",3,To say that I have mixed feelings on this one would be an understatement.....,1196985600,"12 7, 2007",2007,3401,"['film', 'unique', 'distinction', 'being', 'one', 'most', 'technically', 'innovative', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'also', 'one', 'most', 'disgustingly', 'racist', 'pictures', 'ever', 'made.Techincally', 'film', 'astounding', 'film', '3', 'hours', 'early', 'versions', 'reportedly', 'ran', '3', '1/2', 'hours', 'most', 'silent', 'films', 'time', 'were', '2', 'reelers', 'running', '20', 'minutes', 'so', 'reel', 'film', 'was', 'roughly', '10', 'minutes', 'D.W.', 'Griffith', 'pushed', 'envelope', 'encompassing', 'more', 'more', 'film', 'treating', 'respect', 'saying', 'quite', 'rightly', 'was', 'art', 'form', 'would', 'replace', 'books', 'history', 'latter', 'part', 'statement', 'debatable', 'not', 'first', 'cutting', 'here', 'wide', 'shots', 'close', 'ups', 'pretty', 'standard', 'editing', 'nowadays', 'was', 'considered', 'revolutionary', 'when', 'D.W.', 'started', 'film', 'was', 'true', 'epic', 'played', 'many', 'huge', 'theaters', 'was', 'treated', 'night', 'opera', 'made', 'people', 'sit', 'up', 'notice', 'film', 'was', 'true', 'art', 'form', 'think', 'people', 'were', 'so', 'moved', 'was', 'spectactular', 'film', 'filled', 'great', 'battle', 'scenes', 'epic', 'scope', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'attempted', 'before', 'historical', 'document', 'incalcuable.As', 'thematic', 'elements', 'stories', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'films', 'unbridled', 'racism', 'are', 'true', 'Blacks', 'played', 'whites', 'black', 'face', 'offensive', 'enough', 'are', 'portrayed', 'most', 'unflattering', 'disgusting', 'stereotypes', ""'ve"", 'been', 'subjected', 'One', 'slaves', 'Gus', 'one', 'Cameron', 'daughters', 'Gus', 'portrayed', 'someone', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'control', 'white', 'women', 'reprehensible', 'up', 'killing', 'being', 'black', 'man', 'blacks', 'receive', 'emancipation', 'start', 'harassing', 'whites', 'KKK', 'save', 'white', 'civilization', 'film', 'only', 'film', 'know', 'KKK', 'positive', 'light', 'intertitles', 'are', 'so', 'outrageous', 'are', 'really', 'shocked', 'see', 'one', 'people', 'come', 'together', 'defense', 'Aryan', 'birthright', 'People', 'were', 'naturally', 'offended', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'dismissed', 'political', 'correctness', 'was', '1917', 'where', 'was', 'term', 'political', 'correctness', 'NAACP', 'despised', 'film', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'made', 'protested', 'vigorously', 'Griffith', 'defended', 'film', 'even', 'saying', 'interview', 'Klan', 'was', 'needed', 'days', 'saw', 'interview', 'early', 'VHS', 'copy', 'film', 'Griffith', 'was', 'trying', 'convince', 'people', 'be', 'nicer', 'saying', 'Klan', 'was', ""n't"", 'helpful', 'Considering', 'Klan', 'one', 'most', 'heinous', 'organizations', 'American', 'history', 'was', 'historically', 'incorrect', 'human', 'standpoint', 'outrageous.It', 'difficult', 'seperate', 'sheer', 'scope', 'innovations', 'film', 'disgusting', 'incredibly', 'false', 'portrayal', 'black', 'people', 'So', 'do', 'think', 'people', 'should', 'see', 'film', 'Yes', 'keep', 'mind', 'will', 'be', 'infuriated', 'end', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seriously', 'expect', 'anyone', 'sit', 'film', 'not', 'be', 'outraged', 'stereotypical', 'ugly', 'racist', 'way', 'blacks', 'are', 'depicted', 'just', 'impossible', 'do', 'can', 'somehow', 'appreciate', 'epic', 'story', 'great', 'camerawork', 'editing', 'like', 'may', 'get', 'something', 'it.Griffith', 'next', 'film', 'was', 'Intolerance', 'perhaps', 'atonement', 'portrayal', 'blacks', 'here', 'technical', 'marvel', 'one', 'ended', 'up', 'bankrupting', 'Griffith']",N/A

Well, some of it is. A lot of it isn't. This is a film from 1915 and its age shows.

Two families, the Stonemans from the north and the Camerons from South Carolina, have their friendship destroyed by the Civil War. Lillian Gish is Elsie Stoneman. Scenes proceed from Civil War battles to the Lincoln assassination to the rise of the Ku Klux Klan. There were 625,000 casualties in the Civil War, and this is essentially an anti-war film. Modern critics like Roger Ebert miss the point. Griffith's title refers to the birth of the United States, heretofore a loose confederation of former colonies, not to the birth of the KKK. A graphic near the end reads, ""Dare we dream of a golden day when the brutal War shall rule no more.""",4,The Birth of a Nation,1203638400,"02 22, 2008",2008,736,"['D.', 'W.', 'Griffith', 'silent', 'film', 'based', 'Clansman', 'Thomas', 'Dixon', 'Graphics', 'tell', 'story', 'Two', 'families', 'Stonemans', 'north', 'Camerons', 'South', 'Carolina', 'have', 'friendship', 'destroyed', 'Civil', 'War', 'Lillian', 'Gish', 'Elsie', 'Stoneman', 'Scenes', 'proceed', 'Civil', 'War', 'Lincoln', 'assassination', 'rise', 'Ku', 'Klux', 'Klan', 'were', '625,000', 'casualties', 'Civil', 'War', 'essentially', 'anti-war', 'film', 'Modern', 'critics', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'miss', 'point', 'Griffith', 'title', 'refers', 'birth', 'United', 'States', 'heretofore', 'loose', 'confederation', 'former', 'colonies', 'not', 'birth', 'KKK', 'A', 'graphic', 'end', 'Dare', 'dream', 'golden', 'day', 'when', 'brutal', 'War', 'shall', 'rule', 'more']",N/A

""Birth Of A Nation"" is both aw inspiring and disgusting. Aw inspiring in it's story line and cinematography and disgusting in its portrayal of blacks and the way it make the KKK look like heros saving the white race. It is however an important movie in the history of film making. The first blockbuster film to be made it set standards in film making that still are applied today. D.W. Griffith did an unbelievable job of creating and directing this film epic. The first part of the movie deals with the civil war and how it effects two families, one from the north and the other from the south, who are friends. The battle scenes are amazing and the acting is first rate. The recreation of the assasination of President Lincoln is chilling. If only the movie had ended with the ending of the war. The first part is excellant and I love that part. Unfortunately Griffith during the second part bases the movie movie on the novel ""The Klansmen"". This is where I start to hate the movie. The novel looks at reconstruction as a time of great evil across the south. Freed slaves take over control of the south and white people are helpless to stop it. Every kind of racial stereotype that has ever been attached to blacks are depicted in the film. The turning point comes when a young white girl commits suicide rather then be sexually molested by a black man. Thats when the Klan is created to fight back against reconstruction. The movie unfortunately paints the KKK as heros who save the day and puts the blacks back in their place. In spite of the second half of the movie this is still one I highly recommend getting. Looking past the second part of ""Birth Of A Nation"" this is still a masterpiece and very well made. ""Birth"" is also important in film history and that alone can be reason enough to add to your movie collection.

396363,A3UGLMD1GKIZGR,630401967X,"Jason Robey ""horakhti""","[14, 14]","What can one say about one of the single most important events in cinematic history? There is not a film today that doesn't owe something to ""The Birth of a Nation"", the grandfather of all films. Director D.W. Griffith almost single handedly transformed film from mere sideshow curiosity to a legitimate art form in a single fell swoop.Unfortunately however, it is hard to praise ""The Birth of a Nation"" without likewise condemning it. It is one of the most racist movies ever made. There are still those today who want it banned. However, in my opinion, banning this film was a question for Americans in 1915, not 2003. It has already made its mark in the world and today it is more or less a historical artifact. Rather, I think that we should be encouraged to watch it, to critique it, to praise its technical innovations and artistic breakthroughs, and to condemn its unapologetic racism and misguided moral stances. In its triumphs and its downfalls, ""The Birth of a Nation"" has much to teach us.As for the film itself, it's best to research ahead of time why it is such a technological and artistic breakthrough. There are several sites on the web that discuss all of the innovations employed in the movie by director D.W. Griffith (and his unheralded cameraman, Billy Bitzer.)Historical significance aside, is ""The Birth of a Nation"" an enjoyable film? In my opinion: yes, with the right frame of mind. It's a silent film, so you have to infer a lot of things from the subtitles and the acting. It's a bit like watching a foreign film in that respect, though the acting tends to be melodramatic in exchange for dialogue.The story, about two families from the North and the South, is well told and always engaging. The first part of the movie deals with the pre-Civil War era up through Lincoln's postwar assassination. The second, more controversial half deals with the Reconstruction of the South.Throughout we are given historically accurate vignettes, such as Lee's surrender to Grant at Appomatox. My favorite was the magnificently edited scene at Ford's Theater. On the other hand, I found it hard to follow many of the Civil War battles, which were often filmed from afar or at night. Especially annoying is the red tint that was used for scenes where something is burning. These are cinematic innovations, but they are still taxing on the eyes.The acting is very charming. Lillian Gish, who is widely heralded as the greatest actress of the silent era, is wonderful, as are Henry B. Walthall as the ""Little Colonel"" and Mae Marsh as the ""Little Sister."" Some of the greatest scenes in the film are Walthall's mournful expressions, especially when he returns to his home after the war.But the way African Americans are portrayed in the film is shocking and appalling. Without exception they are played as grotesque caricatures and stereotypes rather than human beings. The major African American characters are played by whites in blackface, which comes off as extremely disconcerting. Especially creepy is a so-called ""mulatto"" servant named Lydia who is perpetually aroused throughout the film.Also, I have nothing against a film portraying the Ku Klux Klan in a historical epic about the Reconstruction, but the idea that a group of murdering racists were the heroes and saviors of the South is difficult to digest, to say the least.In conclusion, I highly recommend viewing (or purchasing) ""The Birth of a Nation"", but be sure to do so with a critical mind and a good understanding of where the film's merits and weaknesses lie.",4,A Piece of History,1059091200,"07 25, 2003",2003,3545,"['What', 'can', 'one', 'say', 'one', 'single', 'most', 'important', 'events', 'cinematic', 'history', 'not', 'film', 'today', ""n't"", 'owe', 'something', 'Birth', 'Nation', 'grandfather', 'films', 'Director', 'D.W.', 'Griffith', 'almost', 'single', 'handedly', 'transformed', 'film', 'mere', 'sideshow', 'curiosity', 'legitimate', 'art', 'form', 'single', 'fell', 'swoop.Unfortunately', 'however', 'hard', 'praise', 'Birth', 'Nation', 'likewise', 'condemning', 'one', 'most', 'racist', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'are', 'still', 'today', 'who', 'want', 'banned', 'However', 'opinion', 'banning', 'film', 'was', 'question', 'Americans', '1915', 'not', '2003', 'already', 'made', 'mark', 'world', 'today', 'more', 'less', 'historical', 'artifact', 'Rather', 'think', 'should', 'be', 'encouraged', 'watch', 'critique', 'praise', 'technical', 'innovations', 'artistic', 'breakthroughs', 'condemn', 'unapologetic', 'racism', 'misguided', 'moral', 'stances', 'triumphs', 'downfalls', 'Birth', 'Nation', 'much', 'teach', 'us.As', 'film', 'best', 'research', 'ahead', 'time', 'why', 'such', 'technological', 'artistic', 'breakthrough', 'are', 'several', 'sites', 'web', 'innovations', 'employed', 'movie', 'director', 'D.W.', 'Griffith', 'unheralded', 'cameraman', 'Billy', 'Bitzer', 'Historical', 'significance', 'aside', 'Birth', 'Nation', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'opinion', 'yes', 'right', 'frame', 'mind', 'silent', 'film', 'have', 'infer', 'lot', 'things', 'subtitles', 'acting', 'bit', 'watching', 'foreign', 'film', 'respect', 'acting', 'tends', 'be', 'melodramatic', 'exchange', 'dialogue.The', 'story', 'about', 'two', 'families', 'North', 'South', 'well', 'told', 'always', 'engaging', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'deals', 'pre-Civil', 'War', 'era', 'up', 'Lincoln', 'postwar', 'assassination', 'second', 'more', 'controversial', 'half', 'deals', 'Reconstruction', 'South.Throughout', 'are', 'given', 'historically', 'accurate', 'vignettes', 'such', 'Lee', 'surrender', 'Grant', 'Appomatox', 'favorite', 'was', 'magnificently', 'edited', 'scene', 'Ford', 'Theater', 'other', 'hand', 'found', 'hard', 'follow', 'many', 'Civil', 'War', 'battles', 'were', 'often', 'filmed', 'afar', 'night', 'Especially', 'annoying', 'red', 'tint', 'was', 'used', 'scenes', 'where', 'something', 'burning', 'are', 'cinematic', 'innovations', 'are', 'still', 'taxing', 'eyes.The', 'acting', 'very', 'charming', 'Lillian', 'Gish', 'who', 'widely', 'heralded', 'greatest', 'actress', 'silent', 'era', 'wonderful', 'are', 'Henry', 'B.', 'Walthall', 'Little', 'Colonel', 'Mae', 'Marsh', 'Little', 'Sister', 'greatest', 'scenes', 'film', 'are', 'Walthall', 'mournful', 'expressions', 'especially', 'when', 'home', 'war.But', 'way', 'African', 'Americans', 'are', 'portrayed', 'film', 'shocking', 'appalling', 'exception', 'are', 'played', 'grotesque', 'caricatures', 'stereotypes', 'rather', 'human', 'beings', 'major', 'African', 'American', 'characters', 'are', 'played', 'whites', 'blackface', 'off', 'extremely', 'disconcerting', 'Especially', 'creepy', 'so-called', 'mulatto', 'servant', 'named', 'Lydia', 'who', 'perpetually', 'aroused', 'film.Also', 'have', 'nothing', 'film', 'portraying', 'Ku', 'Klux', 'Klan', 'historical', 'epic', 'Reconstruction', 'idea', 'group', 'murdering', 'racists', 'were', 'heroes', 'saviors', 'South', 'difficult', 'digest', 'say', 'least.In', 'conclusion', 'highly', 'recommend', 'viewing', 'purchasing', 'Birth', 'Nation', 'be', 'sure', 'do', 'so', 'critical', 'mind', 'good', 'understanding', 'where', 'film', 'merits', 'weaknesses', 'lie']",N/A

Griffith's 1915 revisionist film masterpiece, mangles history, excuses slavery and plays into every self-serving racial myth imaginable. The film is also exciting, often poignant and occasionally funny. For modern film buffs, it offers a fascinating glimpse into the conventions of silent movie acting and visual communication. Margaret Cameron's mad forest flight from the lascivious Gus -- complete with almost-cartoonish erratic changes in directions, punctuated with throwing her arms into the air -- was a lesson in how to communicate terror and despair without the use of words or sound.The film would need a thick companion guide to point out its errors, misrepresentations and biases. It would also need someone to discuss how such a Union-unfriendly, ""Negro""-bashing testimony could find acceptance on both sides of the Mason-Dixon line. Over 140 years after the end of hostilities, I found some scenes infuriating. At Appomattox, I can accept that Lee was stoic and noble, but cannot believe the leering, cigar-chomping caricature of Grant portrayed here. Nor can I believe that newly-freed, armed blacks roamed the South, keeping poor, helpless whites away from the polling stations. And on and on. Don't get me started.There is a ""making of"" feature on the DVD. It is much too short to provide in-depth analysis of my questions, which lost it a star, but it does provide some context about America's ambivalence to the slaughter just 50 years in the past. Blaming the fratricidal war on the slaves and meddling, hypocritical abolitionists is one approach, I suppose. Through outtakes and test material previously unseen in public, the feature provides insights into Griffith's filmmaking history and techniques.""Birth of a Nation"" is a movie that, like the period it portrays so badly, has its moments of lightness and dark. It belongs in the American film pantheon, no doubt.

A movie like this can crush a man's ego, forever bruise the mind of the easily offended, and ruin the life of the impressionable.Was Griffith a racist? Perhaps so. Was Griffith a hateful, stupid white man, who believed in the dominance over others? Not at all. Anybody who had seen many of his short films, knew that Griffith's philosophy was that of the poor man's friend. A Corner in Wheat shows the struggle of the poor against a powerful merchant, who gets what is coming to him. His Trust shows a black slave gallantly risking his life for his master...the slave was not portrayed at all as a bad character; nor can the old ""good slave, bad freeman"" arguement be used against that film. Out of his own will, the man saved the little girl from the fire...he was a good man at heart. Intolerance and Broken Blossoms, made in 1916 and 1919 respectively, tell a message very much against racism and fanaticism.

Griffith's epic film of 1915, is an amazing look at early cinematography with a topic that is still discussed almost one hundred years after its premiere. The good news is that this film, even by modern standards, could not and would not be made today for obvious reasons, but as representative ""history"" it stands out.Divided into two equal parts, the film opens with two prominent families during the Civil War. The battle scenes are heroically portrayed and the long scene of Lincoln's assassination is one of the best. The second part, dealing with Reconstruction, is troubling yet fascinating to watch as hate disguised as bravery becomes the theme. The Klan (literally the ""white knights on horseback"") rise to many occasions to save their beleaguered friends and neighbors. The portrayal of blacks in the film is the most unsettling of all.Besides enjoying the performance of a very young Lillian Gish, what I liked most about ""The Birth of a Nation"" was its historic feel rather than its accuracy. If cinematography had been around earlier in the nineteenth century, one might very well assume that the characters, the action, the sets and the props would be just as one saw them in motion.I can understand why watching ""The Birth of a Nation"" would be distressing for many people today, but it helps to remember how far we've come as a country since 1915.

Griffiths is  not only able to create thrilling spectacles such as those depicting the  Sherman March and the siege of Atlanta.  But he is also a master of  intimate and poignant moments, as in the scene where a Confederate solder  reunites with his family in their ruined home after the Civil War, a scene  that never fails to bring tears to my eyes.It is the latter 90 minutes  of the film that incenses viewers to this day.  It is not only a wholesale  endorsement of white supremacy, but also an utter trashing of the black  race so much so that many film stereotypes of blacks persisted for decades  after this film.  Blacks are portrayed as vindictive, greedy, lustful, and  yet ineffectual and lazy ex-slaves bent on defeating the whites of the  South.  In one grotesque moment, a white woman kills herself because she  arouses a black man's attention.  Blacks vow to build a &quot;Black  Empire&quot; to rule over whites, while the Ku Klux Klan serves as the  &quot;rescuer&quot; of the South at the end.  The historical truths about  the post-Civil War Restoration period is of course distorted beyond  recognition by the film.Griffith made anti-racist films like  &quot;Broken Blossom&quot; and films where the KKK is the villain.  But in  &quot;Birth of a Nation&quot;, he made a grostesque travesty out of  historical truths, and showed that he did not fully comprehend the power of  the film medium as a manipulator of opinions, and wasn't ready to deal with  the repercussions the film created.  Racialism was a serious issue then;  unfortunately, it still is today.  Hence the controversy of &quot;Birth of  a Nation&quot; lingers.Griffith did a lot of things right and a lot  wrong in &quot;Birth of a Nation&quot;, and they should be lessons to  future generations of filmmakers.

I was on a quest to watch all top 100 movies on the AFI list, and this was #44. By the release year, 1915, I knew it was an old, silent film. By its name, Birth of a Nation, I imagined it was a historical documentary-style story about how the United States was founded.Instead, as the story unfolded I was hit by a multitude of emotions. First, I'd already seen many other silent films of this era and I was quite impressed with what Griffith was able to do back in 1915. He was breaking milestones left and right with his cinematography, storyline, plotting, and other areas. Yes, certainly, by modern standards we might say that the camerawork could be improved or the plot could be tightened up or so on. But he was the one who started it all. He laid the groundwork that we all learned from.The other thing that astounded me was how clearly racist the movie was. I was shaking my head through half the movie at what was going on. My notepad is full of notes I could not believe. The moviestated the ""KKK ... saved the south from the anarchy of black rule"". When a white girl is threatened with the ""horror"" of a proposal from a black man, she commits suicide. The placard then reads, ""for her who had learned the stern lesson of honor we should not grieve that she found sweeter the OPAL GATES OF DEATH"" (emphasis theirs). OK so they're saying that having relations with a black men was so inconceivable that death was preferable? And when another white woman is proposed to by a half-black man, she talks about *horsewhipping* him for his insolence?Most of the blacks in the movie are played by whites in blackface, the KKK rides into town accompanied by Ride of the Valkyries, and the main focus of half the movie seems to be how the blacks ""want our white women"". The movie focuses on that in the scenes around town, in the scenes in the legislature, and in the story.  No wonder there were riots in many cities where this film was shown. Some cities refused to play it at all.So it's hard for me to put all that plot aside and try to focus just on the technical achievements of the film. I'm not sure what even to compare it with. Maybe it's like trying to judge the culinary traits of a dinner that is made from a brutally murdered child. Yes on one hand you can appreciate the fine cooking - but there's still the issue of what the content is.And certainly the movie is not perfect. Much of the fault-problems have to do with it forging ground that nobody had ever trodden on before. Certainly if the cinematography isn't perfect it's because this was a brand new art at the time. But surely there had been plays for a thousand years at this point and some basics in storytelling were known. The director incorrectly assumes the audience knows all details of the civil war and reconstruction, and glosses over what is going on in some situations. That can make it hard to follow the story if you don't know all the details of what happened.So, with that all being said, I do give the film great credit for the things it achieved. I wish wholeheartedly that it could have made all those breakthroughs while spreading a message of peace, love, and joy. To me it's a shame that this great technical achievement is married to a work that is hurtful and racist.As a final note, amazingly, this movie is one of the few on the entire AFI top 100 list that passed the Bechdel test.

African-American men were played by white actors in blackface and shown as intelligent and aggressive towards white women; in response to these depictions, the Ku Klux Klan was shown as a heroic force.Early in the movie the two Stoneman brothers visit the Camerons in their South Carolina home; the elder son falls in love with Margaret Cameron, wile Ben Cameron becomes infatuated with a photo of Elsie Stoneman.During the war a black militia led by a white ransacks the Cameron house; the Camerons are rescued by Confederates arriving at the last minute.

The DVD contains the most complete version of The Birth of a Nation known and available.  The film is 187 min. long on this disk.  It is a beautiful print, well restored and re-tinted.  A beautiful print.  The musical score is clever and very entertaining too.  I think of any bad thing to say about the disk.  I think most know of the story line and its hints of racism.  It's there and it can't be argued away.  D.W. Griffith was a son of a Civil War soldier and grew up in the South.  He used the book The Clansman by Thomas Dixon Jr. as it jibed with his own viewpoints and many of the day.  The hero worship of the Klan actually encouraged its resurgence in late 1910s and 1920s into the 30s.  The racism brought Griffith so much grief, he spent his life trying to justify his views and created Intolerance to offset the criticism.  What brings The Birth of a Nation is its reliance on story and use of the film camera never tried before in the USA before.  It is a cinema powerhouse and actually a pretty moving film.  Never before had Americans seen the cinema come to life before.  Some French, Italian and German filmmakers created feature films that are quite good and successful, but World War I basically destroyed their film industries and the US reigned supreme.  DW Griffith took American film to the next level permanently.  No longer were films relegated to the poorer urban areas and Nickelodeons.  It was now a popular art form and respectable to attend the cinema.  The DVD also includes a making of, and introduction by DW himself made in 1930, and several early versions of his Civil War films.  It seems to me that because of the closeness to the time period, the films might indicate a closer idea of how former Confederates actually thought and how they remember the war.",5,The Version of The Birth of a Nation to Buy!,1230249600,"12 26, 2008",2008,1960,"['many', 'reviews', 'posted', 'DVD', 'site', 'are', ""n't"", 'actually', 'DVD', 'review', 'specifically', 'review', 'Kino', 'Griffith', 'Masterworks', 'edition', 'DVD', 'most', 'complete', 'version', 'Birth', 'Nation', 'known', 'available', 'film', '187', 'min', 'long', 'disk', 'beautiful', 'print', 'well', 'restored', 're-tinted', 'beautiful', 'print', 'musical', 'score', 'clever', 'very', 'entertaining', 'too', 'think', 'bad', 'thing', 'say', 'disk', 'think', 'most', 'know', 'story', 'line', 'hints', 'racism', 'there', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'argued', 'away', 'D.W.', 'Griffith', 'was', 'son', 'Civil', 'War', 'soldier', 'grew', 'up', 'South', 'used', 'book', 'Clansman', 'Thomas', 'Dixon', 'Jr.', 'jibed', 'own', 'viewpoints', 'many', 'day', 'hero', 'worship', 'Klan', 'actually', 'encouraged', 'resurgence', 'late', '1910s', '1920s', '30s', 'racism', 'brought', 'Griffith', 'so', 'much', 'grief', 'spent', 'life', 'trying', 'justify', 'views', 'created', 'Intolerance', 'offset', 'criticism', 'What', 'Birth', 'Nation', 'reliance', 'story', 'use', 'film', 'camera', 'never', 'tried', 'USA', 'cinema', 'powerhouse', 'actually', 'pretty', 'moving', 'film', 'Never', 'had', 'Americans', 'seen', 'cinema', 'come', 'life', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'filmmakers', 'created', 'feature', 'films', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'successful', 'World', 'War', 'basically', 'destroyed', 'film', 'industries', 'US', 'reigned', 'supreme', 'DW', 'Griffith', 'took', 'American', 'film', 'next', 'level', 'permanently', 'No', 'longer', 'were', 'films', 'relegated', 'poorer', 'urban', 'areas', 'Nickelodeons', 'was', 'now', 'popular', 'art', 'form', 'respectable', 'attend', 'cinema', 'DVD', 'also', 'making', 'introduction', 'DW', 'made', '1930', 'several', 'early', 'versions', 'Civil', 'War', 'films', 'closeness', 'time', 'period', 'films', 'might', 'indicate', 'closer', 'idea', 'how', 'former', 'Confederates', 'actually', 'thought', 'how', 'remember', 'war']",N/A

396384,AAYE34TCTNV2R,630401967X,MarlowesMom,"[4, 4]","SPOILER ALERTIt's pretty ridiculous to assign a rating to 1915's ""The Birth of a Nation"" using a ranking system that ranges from ""I Hated It"" to ""I Loved It."" If this film stirs those kinds of feelings in you in the 21st century, that's kinda scary. You watch ""The Birth of a Nation"" because you are interested in the history of film-making, and you realize that in spite of its content, TBN is technically stunning. That's why introductory college film classes show it, why Library of Congress has registered it as historically and culturally significant, and why it appears on the American Film Institute's list of the 100 best movies ever made.The KINO Griffith Masterworks two-disc edition, a cinema enthusiast's dream, contains the full cut of the film with color tinting in some scenes, a ""Making Of"" documentary, a filmed 1930 discussion between Griffith and actor Walter Houston about TBN, several of Griffith's earlier short Civil War films (they typically run about 11-17 minutes), and--this is something I have not seen on DVD before--a movie magazine article about TBN, some excerpts from ""The Clansman,"" the novel by Southern Baptist minister Thomas Dixon Jr. on which Griffith based TBN, and a censorship case from New York State. You read by using your remote to scroll through screen shots of pages.TBN runs slightly over three hours. It's silent with an accompanying musical soundtrack and printed inter-title cards that comment on what's happening and add a tiny bit of dialogue to the actors' pantomime. You probably don't want to make some popcorn and settle the kiddies on the couch for family movie night with this one.TBN, a white southerner's view of the Civil War and Reconstruction from 1915, has stirred controversy since its release, and I should hope so! The first half of the movie tells the story of two families, the Stonemans and the Camerons, prior to and during the War. The Stoneman sons, whose father (based on Thaddeus Stevens) is an anti-slavery Pennsylvania Congressman with a biracial mistress/housekeeper, and the Cameron sons, whose father is a South Carolina doctor, became friends at boarding school. In Griffith's telling, slavery is a benign institution and the war tramples southern state sovereignty and causes horrible destruction. This part of the movie contains some startlingly offensive moments, but is overall a fairly straightforward, if overlong in my view, telling of the brutality and tragedy of the Civil War as an event that tore the nation apart. The sustained friendship of the families in spite of their taking opposite sides in the war is genuinely touching.The second half of TBN will have anyone other than modern-day white supremacists horrified at Griffith's portrayal of Reconstruction. Freed slaves, acting under the evil influence of Republicans and Yankee carpetbaggers, take over the South Carolina state house and turn it into a drunken bacchanal. They trample the rights of decent white southerners, bar white men from voting, and run wild trying to have sexual relations with white women. According to Griffith, both in TBN and in the special feature 1930 conversation with Walter Houston, these conditions made the Ku Klux Klan necessary for self-respecting white men to protect their women, restore their voting rights, and put black people back in their proper, subservient place. Griffith shows the Klan in an unwaveringly heroic light. Even more shocking, Griffith gives the material the gloss of historical truth, citing textbook sources on some of the intertitle cards and claiming that then-sitting President Woodrow Wilson, a Virginian and a history professor at Princeton, personally endorsed the film's accuracy. Horrific as it is, the second half of TBN is a stunning piece of film-making. The audience is completely drawn into the action, which moves at a brisk pace with groundbreaking camera work and editing.In a bizarre final couple of scenes, Griffith pleads for peace with an image of Jesus looking over a crowd and plays The Star Spangled Banner in celebration of national unity.Music being so crucial to silent film, a brief comment on the KINO soundtrack: I am not sure if this was the original score played at movie houses in 1915. It's mundane in the first half, consisting mostly of refrains of well-known Civil War-era tunes like ""Dixie."" The second half picks up steam with what, as far as I know, is mostly original scoring (yes, I did recognize the Wagner playing as the Klan rode to the rescue) that enhances the mood and effectiveness of scenes.Anybody who's serious about film should see ""The Birth of a Nation,"" but be aware of what you're getting into. I had read enough to know that it contained favorable treatment of the KKK, but reading in no way prepared me for how shocked I actually found myself as I watched.",4,"Stunning Filmmaking, Abhorrent

Nothing has so effectively symbolized a country torn apart by racism and  hate so well as Birth of a Nation.Birth of a Nation always has  received lots of negative press for its portrayal of the Ku Klux Klan.  Many claim the film exists as merely racist propaganda against blacks.  In  fact, Griffith was not a racist and directed the whole film as a view of  the Civil War from the Southern perspective.  Griffith, not-so-ironically,  followed this film up with the equally mesmerizing, yet critically panned  epic Intolerance.Birth of a Nation deserves to be brought on DVD, as  video tape just doesn't do justice to this scratchy silent classic.",5,One of the first (and best) films ever made!,958521600,"05 17, 2000",2000,1006,"['Birth', 'Nation', 'quintessential', 'masterpiece', 'D.W.', 'Griffith', 'place', 'American', 'history', 'true', 'genius', 'behind', 'filmmaking', 'art', 'form', 'Birth', 'Nation', 'astonishing', 'film', 'Griffith', 'heart-felt', 'messages', 'trust', 'national', 'pride', 'racial', 'tension', 'hold', 'up', 'pretty', 'well', 'even', '85', 'years', 'fact', 'Nothing', 'so', 'effectively', 'symbolized', 'country', 'torn', 'apart', 'racism', 'hate', 'so', 'well', 'Birth', 'Nation.Birth', 'Nation', 'always', 'received', 'lots', 'negative', 'press', 'portrayal', 'Ku', 'Klux', 'Klan', 'Many', 'claim', 'film', 'as', 'merely', 'racist', 'propaganda', 'blacks', 'fact', 'Griffith', 'was', 'not', 'racist', 'directed', 'whole', 'film', 'view', 'Civil', 'War', 'Southern', 'perspective', 'Griffith', 'not-so-ironically', 'followed', 'film', 'up', 'equally', 'mesmerizing', 'yet', 'critically', 'panned', 'epic', 'Intolerance.Birth', 'Nation', 'be', 'brought', 'DVD', 'video', 'tape', 'just', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice', 'scratchy', 'silent', 'classic']",N/A

396389,A18PM27WKPXV92,630401967X,"olympio ""olympio""","[14, 15]","This is a review of the Blu-ray edition, a three-disc set, two of which are in standarddefinition. How does BOAN appear in Blu-ray? Nothing revelatory here. It claims to be mastered in HD from archival 35 mm elements, not newly restored. The 1993 restoration is ondisc 2 in standard definition (and full screen)  It is nice to see the film in what is presumably the correct aspect ratio on blu ray.  This is probably about as good as the filmis ever going to look, and it is satisfactory, considering we are dealing with a film madealmost a hundred years ago. And in one medium to long shot, I thought I could seeon the neck of the female actor who played Mammy, obviously in blackface, the point wherethey forgot to make up entirely the back of her neck. The picture certainly has never lookedbetter on any home video medium. Whether it looks better than the standard definitionversion on disc 2 is perhaps debatable.However, the blu-ray disc is,in my judgment, marred by the decision to include a newly composed score as the only music scoreoption. I find it to be undistinguished for the most part.  After watching the blu-raydisc with this option several days ago, I viewed several portions of the film last nightin the standard definition format (disc 2). Here we are given the 1993 restoration of DavidShepard with a 1993 adaptation of the original score of Joseph Carl Breil. This consistsof period-specific music such as ""Bonnie Blue Flag,"" the infamous ""Dixie,"" ""Year of Jubilo,""and other American compositions, as well as the work of several nineteenth-century composers(I recall hearing strands of what I believe were Rubinstein's ""Ocean"" Symphony as well asa composition of Edvard Grieg). The battle scenes in the film are much more stirring whenaccompanied by the period music rather than the newly minted score. That being said, onthe blu-ray disc, we are given two audio options for the new Mont Alto Orchestra score, 2.0Stereo and DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1. No complaints about the sound here, simply about the lackof the Breil score option on the blu-ray disc. This same disc includes the filmed introductionof D.W. Griffith and Walter Huston. Here blu ray does serve to noticeably enhance thepicture from its original incarnation on a Kino standard definition edition of the film,at least insofar as memory serves correctly--I no longer own that standard definition version.Disc 3, also standard definition, contains Griffith's shorter Civil War films, but alsoextensive documentation of ""New York versus The Birth of a Nation,"" centered on the legalbattles to prevent its showing in New York upon its re-release in 1922. It's fascinatingmaterial, presenting the opposing contentions that initial screenings of the film in 1915did or did not produce riots. Thus, we are shown that not only the content of the filmbut its effects on the public are controversial and in dispute. I discovered by internetresearch that it is even disputed whether President Woodrow Wilson actually uttered hisfamous description of the film as ""history written with lightning."" The section on the 1922litigation also offers some interesting philosophical reflections on cinema's potential effects on public morality, clearly an issue that has not gone away.This film seems to cry for a commentary on the blu-ray disc, both as to the historicity orlack of same of some of the film's claims about historical events and as to its effectson the public. But alas, who would give an objective commentary, could any American, livingor dead, untouched by the passions which have swirled about the film since its release,accomplish the task? Part of the problem, of course, is that Birth of a Nation was basedon two virulent novels by Thomas Dixon, a racist if ever there was one. But there is alsothe problem that Griffith seems to be expressing the synthesis, or majority view of hisgeneration, arising from the clash of thesis (Reconstruction) with antithesis (Southernresistance, the Klan, etc.) Thus, he appeals to the authority of Woodrow Wilson as historianin several of his intertitle cards to substantiate his historical claims. Moreover, heactually celebrates the death of states' rights in another intertitle card! Upon closerexamination, there may be something to offend people of all political persuasions in the film.This film, of course, is distinguished by its almost complete lack of subtlety.The power of its images is such that it is a legitimate question about itseffects on the viewer. Though it is a silent film, and the acting styles are quaint andoutmoded, still one has to wonder if it is really so far removed from Oliver Stone's ""JFK,""for example, another film which has been accused of manipulating history. And does notall film manipulate in the name of artistic license? If a picture really is worth a thousandwords, isn't the motion picture viewer a thousand times more vulnerable to suggestion,even ""corruption"" of his values than a reader, who at least can control the pace at whichhe peruses a book or reject it more easily than the mesmerizing form of a film?All in all, this is a release worth owning, perhaps more for the supplements on discs2 and 3 as for the feature film in blu ray. It is not so much entertainment as it iseducational in nature, though it must be admitted that scenes in the film still retaina power of storytelling that engendered much of the controversy over its effect on thepopulace. It probably does accurately mirror the majority view of white Americans in the early20th century, admittedly racist. I give this release four stars because of the failure toinclude the Breil score option on the blu ray, a serious omission when dealing with a filmwhose greatest claim to fame is its importance for the history of American and world cinema.One wants to view such a historical film accompanied by music such as its original audienceswould have heard.A couple of afterthoughts. I personally, as a Christian, am offended by the Klan's useof the cross, as when they rush to the rescue of the parties trapped in the little cabin.At the same time, I realize that such use in the picture probably reflects a historicalreality. The point I was trying to make about a commentary is that it would take a verybrave man indeed to do a full and complete commentary on this film, subject as he wouldbe to possible vituperation from many different quarters. If, as I believe, all cinemaworthy of the name has a point of view and is therefore propaganda in some sense, thisone at least has the merit that it is overt and blatant and not concealed. That may notmake it any the less dangerous. Finally, a review on another website suggests thatthe Mont Alto score on the blu-ray disc is indeed the original score played with themovie when it first appeared. If that is the case, then the information on the packagingprovided by Kino is misleading, since it calls the Breil score the ""original."" Finally,I have never purchased a disc that was as difficult to extract from its cardboard slipcaseas this one. I was almost on the point of cutting it open with scissors when I finallymanaged to pull it out. Subsequent attempts to pull the discs out were just as arduous,with the result that I am now shelving the discs in the plastic container without thecardboard slipcase.",4,Cinema is propaganda and

396390,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,630401967X,Only-A-Child,"[7, 10]","Here are a few thoughts on three of the Civil War Shorts in this package.""Swords and Hearts"" is the last and the best of the seven Civil War shorts Griffith directed over this three-year period. This group nicely illustrates his tracking along a very steep learning curve as he becomes ever more technically and creatively proficient with the new art form of film-making. ""Swords and Hearts"" is billed as a wartime story in old Virginia and entertainingly alternates between domestic and battle sequences.The chapter captions pretty much tell the story: 1. Hugh Frazier (Wilfred Lucas) son of a wealthy tobacco planter 2. His neighbor-Irene Lambert (Claire McDowell) beautiful but calculating 3. Jennie Baker (Dorothy West) and her father (Francis J. Grandon) of the ""poor white class"" 4. Promise me you will be mine 5. To join his company in the confederate army 6. We shall marry when you return 7. Months later, unknown to Hugh, Jennie's chance to prove her love 8. To steal a visit with Irene 9. Old Ben (William J. Butler) anticipates the bushwhackers' attack 10. Defeated in war, rejected in love 11. Hugh realizes her loyalty and worth.The story incorporates Griffith's favorite themes, the superior virtues of the poor whites and the loyalty of the Negro slaves to their masters. It is quite ambitious as at times Griffith cross-cuts between three different events occurring simultaneously. Unfortunately the use of white actors in black-face in several scenes is disconcerting.Dorothy West was arguably the most contemporary looking and natural of all the silent film stars. Consequently her films from 1910-1917 have held up better even than stuff made years later at the end of the silent film era. West combines the seemingly contradictory qualities of adolescent femininity that fascinated Griffith; a virginal unworldliness and a plucky practicality. In the film's best action sequence Jennie demonstrates her practicality by taking Hugh's uniform and horse, then leading the Yankee cavalry away from her love (during his liaison with Irene). An accomplished rider, West does her own stunts and even shoots a Yankee from horseback.""In the Border States"" is another of  Griffith's Civil War shorts. Although filmed in the wilds of New Jersey (Delaware Water Gap), from the title the likely intended setting is western Maryland, West Virginia, or eastern Kentucky. A border state would have sent units to both armies but this short features the home of a departing union soldier.Shortly after he leaves with his regiment an unarmed Condederate arrives at the soldier's house and his youngest daughter (played by Gladys Egan-Mary Pickford has a smaller part as the older daughter) hides him from a Yankee patrol. He tries to kiss her in appreciation but the little girl is too patriotic to allow this. A few days later her wounded father stumbles home pursued by a Confederate patrol. The Confederate she saved is detailed to search the house and he returns the favor by not turning in her father. The little girl again refuses his kiss but they compromise and salute each other.This is a cute little home front story in the standard silent film style of acting, much more like stage acting than acting for the camera. Some of the scenes are captioned but it is largely unnecessary because you can follow the pantomime without any trouble. Griffith inserts a couple of then revolutionary edits (match cuts) into the film, as actors are going though a door and then coming into the room on the other side. Watch for one of the first continuity problems ever, as a solder with two chevrons on his sleeves goes into the house and in the cut to him from inside he is wearing a uniform with no chevrons.Griffith manages to incorporate some nice scenery into a couple exterior shots that are staged to take advantage of the scenic background.""The Fugitive"" is a surprisingly moving D.W. Griffith Civil War short with a focus on the home front. Two sons named John (one from a Union family and one from a Confederate family) go off to war leaving behind their mothers and fianc?es. Their respective foraging parties encounter each other and exchange fire, and the Union party runs into the woods near the home of the Confederate John. During the pursuit the two Johns fire on each other and Confederate John is killed. Union John (Edwin August) seeks shelter in a nearby house and persuades the mother (Kate Bruce) of the soldier he just killed to hide him. She continues to conceal him even after learning that he killed her son, basically to spare his mother the grief that she is experiencing.Griffith shorts frequently emphasized this ""brother against brother"" theme of the war, probably because he came from the border state of Kentucky which furnished units to both armies.Note that the confederate home has a portrait of George Washington on display. Also note the almost contemporary look and manner of Dorothy West (who plays the finance of the Confederate soldier), she looks and acts little different than a typical 2006 high school girl with acting aspirations.Then again, what do I know?

396391,A148R759F9JW0A,630401967X,othoniaboys,"[3, 4]","The novel upon which this classic film was based, Thomas Dixon's 'The Clansman' (not Klansman), has been all but forgotten, while the Griffith film remains immortal after an entire century has passed, even in the face of relentless criticism as to its wildly politically incorrect views with regard to history and race.  'Gone With the Wind' is an interracial lovefest compared with this.  I have seen this film several times.  I grew up in a Southern family that considered the Confederates to be the good guys.  My father was a child when this film first came out, and he remembered the original controversy.  It must be remembered that there were still many elderly men alive in 1915 who were veterans of the Civil War, and I suppose that my father met, or at least saw, some of them.  I will say flat out that Nathan Bedford Forrest is a hero to me.  If the slaves or ex-slaves were shown in this film as a species of idiots and rapists, it is because (a) you cannot take a totally uneducated ex-slave and put him in the state legislature without expecting him to behave somewhat less than brilliantly; and just because the doctored history textbooks portray the blacks of that era (or indeed, of any era) as innocent victims, does not mean that there were no black rapists that needed dealing with in those days.  It is to be remembered that the defeated white Southerners of the Reconstruction era (so-called) were, or would have been, at the mercy of Federal troops, carpetbaggers, scalawags and ex-slaves, had it not been for self-defense militias that arose to defend the whites in a manner that could hardly be expected, considering the circumstances, to be anything other than terroristic.  At any rate, this was the first great motion picture, great in every way, still one of the finest, no matter what.  Lillian Gish of Marietta (Ohio, not Georgia) has always been one of my favorite actresses, and she was at her finest here.

396392,A3I4EX7TBWUT1U,630401967X,"""patrick_mcknight""","[0, 7]","D.W. Griffith's ""The Birth of a Nation"" is one of those infuriating films that you have trouble either praising or lambasting.  Because of my schizophrenic views on this film, I will do a bit of both.This landmark silent film concerns two families, the northern Stonemans, and the southern Camerons.  The Stonemans come to visit their friends the Camerons at their plantation in the South.  They are given a tour of the mansion and of the cotton fields where we see the slaves toiling happily(!) away, glad to serve their white masters.  Since I'm from Canada where a lot of runaway slaves ended up, this grates with my views.Then the Civil War errupts.  The Stonemans return to the North and the two families find themselves on opposite sides of the battlefields.  Griffith shows himself here to be very technically advanced, far ahead of most directors of his age.  The battle scenes must have been quite stunning to audiences of 1915.  Some of the shots of the war remind me of the Matthew Brady photographs that Griffith apparently studied.After the war, President Lincoln promises to treat the South ""as if they had never been gone"".  Unfortuately, he is assasinated in another stunning sequence that is remarkable for its accuracy, as well as for the way Griffith cross-cuts between scenes to build suspense.Now Austin Stoneman is President.  Stoneman enlists the help of an evil power-hungry mulatto named Silas Lynch.  Together, the two proceed to do such evil things as give blacks the vote, give blacks the right to marry whites, and make blacks equal to whites.  Apparently, Griffith has something against equality in America.  Stoneman and Lynch also disenfranchise white voters, and terrorize anyone who won't support them.  Frankly, I think it was blacks who had a hard time voting in Reconstruction and blacks who were terrorized, but this doesn't seem to bother Griffith.It gets worse.  As newly freed blacks start rampaging across the South, Ben Cameron forms the Ku Klux Klan to save the white South from free blacks, carpetbaggers, and black rapists.  The Klan is described as a heroic band of white knights that saved the South from shame.  I always thought the Klan brought shame to the South, rather than saving them from it.  Yes, there were carpetbaggers who exploited blacks during Reconstruction, but supporting the Klan against carpetbaggers is like supporting Al-Quaeda against the Soviets.  As for black rapists, it was more common for whites to rape blacks then the other way around.  How does Griffith think that light skinned blacks came to be?  Rape has to do with power, something blacks at that time didn't have, even after the war.The ending is very disturbing.  It shows both Northerners and Southerners embracing the Klan and bringing order back to the South by putting blacks back in their places.  Griffith refers to this in the titles as ""North and South reunited in defence of their Aryan birthright"".  Besides being a twisting of history, this is extremely offensive.""The Birth of a Nation"" is unquestionably one of the most important films ever made.  It was Hollywood's first great epic, its technical superiority and commercial success established films as the arform of the twentieth century.  The extreme length (2 1/2 hours) was unprecedented at the time as well as its attention to period detail.  It is widely considered to be the greatest landmark in American cinema.However, its racist sentiments have always tainted this film's reputation.  The film had very real repercussions, as the Klan revived itself that very year and remained active throughout the twenties.  As late as the seventies, this film was used as a recruitment tool.This is why I cannot give this film five stars.  While some would argue it deserves a five star rating on account of its influence on films, I believe that to judge a film, one must judge it on both its technical proficiency AND its message.  I can't forget that little intro with Griffith and Walter Huston where Griffith says that ""the Klan at that time was needed and served a purpose"".  Griffith's politics have tainted even his best films.  A film's message count as much to a film's rating as much as its technical proficiency.  Therefore, I am giving ""The Birth of a Nation"" three stars.",3,"The Birth of the Cinema, The Rebirth of the Klan",1030233600,"08 25, 2002",2002,4282,"['D.W.', 'Griffith', 'Birth', 'Nation', 'one', 'infuriating', 'films', 'have', 'trouble', 'praising', 'lambasting', 'schizophrenic', 'views', 'film', 'will', 'do', 'bit', 'both.This', 'landmark', 'silent', 'film', 'concerns', 'two', 'families', 'northern', 'Stonemans', 'southern', 'Camerons', 'Stonemans', 'come', 'visit', 'friends', 'Camerons', 'plantation', 'South', 'are', 'given', 'tour', 'mansion', 'cotton', 'fields', 'where', 'see', 'slaves', 'toiling', 'happily', 'away', 'glad', 'serve', 'white', 'masters', ""'m"", 'Canada', 'where', 'lot', 'runaway', 'slaves', 'ended', 'up', 'views.Then', 'Civil', 'War', 'errupts', 'Stonemans', 'return', 'North', 'two', 'families', 'find', 'opposite', 'sides', 'battlefields', 'Griffith', 'here', 'be', 'very', 'technically', 'advanced', 'far', 'ahead', 'most', 'directors', 'age', 'battle', 'scenes', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'stunning', 'audiences', '1915', 'shots', 'war', 'Matthew', 'Brady', 'Griffith', 'apparently', 'studied.After', 'war', 'President', 'Lincoln', 'treat', 'South', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'gone', 'Unfortuately', 'assasinated', 'stunning', 'sequence', 'remarkable', 'accuracy', 'as', 'well', 'way', 'Griffith', 'cross-cuts', 'scenes', 'build', 'suspense.Now', 'Austin', 'Stoneman', 'President', 'Stoneman', 'help', 'evil', 'power-hungry', 'mulatto', 'named', 'Silas', 'Lynch', 'Together', 'two', 'proceed', 'do', 'such', 'evil', 'things', 'give', 'blacks', 'vote', 'give', 'blacks', 'right', 'marry', 'whites', 'make', 'blacks', 'equal', 'whites', 'Apparently', 'Griffith', 'something', 'equality', 'America', 'Stoneman', 'Lynch', 'also', 'disenfranchise', 'white', 'voters', 'terrorize', 'anyone', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'support', 'Frankly', 'think', 'was', 'blacks', 'who', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'voting', 'Reconstruction', 'blacks', 'who', 'were', 'terrorized', ""n't"", 'seem', 'bother', 'Griffith.It', 'worse', 'newly', 'freed', 'blacks', 'start', 'rampaging', 'South', 'Ben', 'Cameron', 'Ku', 'Klux', 'Klan', 'save', 'white', 'South', 'free', 'blacks', 'carpetbaggers', 'black', 'rapists', 'Klan', 'described', 'heroic', 'band', 'white', 'knights', 'saved', 'South', 'shame', 'always', 'thought', 'Klan', 'brought', 'shame', 'South', 'rather', 'saving', 'Yes', 'were', 'carpetbaggers', 'who', 'exploited', 'blacks', 'Reconstruction', 'supporting', 'Klan', 'carpetbaggers', 'supporting', 'Al-Quaeda', 'Soviets', 'black', 'rapists', 'was', 'more', 'common', 'whites', 'rape', 'blacks', 'then', 'other', 'way', 'How', 'Griffith', 'think', 'light', 'skinned', 'blacks', 'came', 'be', 'Rape', 'do', 'power', 'something', 'blacks', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'even', 'war.The', 'ending', 'very', 'disturbing', 'Northerners', 'Southerners', 'embracing', 'Klan', 'bringing', 'order', 'back', 'South', 'putting', 'blacks', 'back', 'places', 'Griffith', 'refers', 'titles', 'North', 'South', 'reunited', 'defence', 'Aryan', 'birthright', 'being', 'twisting', 'history', 'extremely', 'offensive', 'Birth', 'Nation', 'unquestionably', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'was', 'Hollywood', 'first', 'great', 'epic', 'technical', 'superiority', 'commercial', 'success', 'established', 'films', 'arform', 'twentieth', 'century', 'extreme', 'length', '2', '1/2', 'hours', 'was', 'unprecedented', 'time', 'as', 'well', 'attention', 'period', 'detail', 'widely', 'considered', 'be', 'greatest', 'landmark', 'American', 'cinema.However', 'racist', 'sentiments', 'have', 'always', 'tainted', 'film', 'reputation', 'film', 'had', 'very', 'real', 'repercussions', 'Klan', 'revived', 'very', 'year', 'remained', 'active', 'twenties', 'As', 'late', 'seventies', 'film', 'was', 'used', 'recruitment', 'tool.This', 'why', 'can', 'not', 'give', 'film', 'five', 'stars', 'would', 'argue', 'five', 'star', 'rating', 'account', 'influence', 'films', 'believe', 'judge', 'film', 'one', 'must', 'judge', 'technical', 'proficiency', 'message', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forget', 'little', 'intro', 'Griffith', 'Walter', 'Huston', 'where', 'Griffith', 'Klan', 'time', 'was', 'needed', 'served', 'purpose', 'Griffith', 'politics', 'have', 'tainted', 'even', 'best', 'films', 'film', 'message', 'count', 'as', 'much', 'film', 'rating', 'as', 'much', 'technical', 'proficiency', 'Therefore', 'am', 'giving', 'Birth', 'Nation', 'three', 'stars']",N/A

The Battle scenes are spectacular, The acting is pretty good considering the lack of sound.  The occasional comedy is ok and in an age of everything digital the sight of a large scene full of real people and the desire to control it is appealing.We clearly see this story is being told from the view of the old south that still existed in living memory at the time.  Lincoln is treated with some deference (we will ask the great heart) but to say this film is practically pining for the old Confederacy is the understatement of the year.You get some impressions of the racial attitudes in the first third of the picture when we get glimpses of the old south but it's the reconstruction scenes that are so unbelievable vile and twisted in its view that one is unsure if you are watchingTriumph of the Will (Remastered).What is even worse in purely cinematic terms the 2nd half is an exciting movie so it reinforces a message that is so racist that it was controversial even in 1915 and led to the resurgence of the KKK and all the blood that would follow.It can't be denied that ignoring the subject matter, what Griffith does on screen was genius.  A breakthrough for its day and age, a masterpiece of cinematic achievement that is the ancestor of the great movies of today.  That as a movie it can stand up to a modern film in terms of quality speaks to that.It also can't be denied that the message it conveys is dehumanizing to an entire race of people, simply evil and wrong.  While it argues the futility of war it presents a case to justify the permanent subjugation of millions based upon race.  The closing image of Christ as if an endorsement of this blasphemy managed to add one more outrage to an already outrageous message.  In this sense it is a greater ancestor to Michael Moore'sFahrenheit 9/11as a propaganda organ (that thankfully can't match the quality).To truly understand an era one should read the newspapers and history books of the time, and also to watch the films.

DelParto ""Rose2""","[7, 9]","The Birth of a Nation has been the most hailed and critically criticized film in American history due to its intolerance to race and one-sided perspective and entertainment quality.  Yes, it was indeed a controversial film when it was released, and still is as controversial as it was decades ago.  How can one define this film in terms of historical significance?  From an objective point of view, D.W. Griffith intricately put together an epic of a film from lithographs and political cartoons that grossly depicted and stereotyped African Americans, but helped to recreate the images of the leaders during the time, Abraham Lincoln, General Robert E. Lee, Ulysses S. Grant, and Thaddeus Stevens.  The whole crux of the film was to present the opposing side of the Civil War -- the heroes in the film were the KKK and the Confederates. For what reason, besides being inspired by a play called ""The Clansman"", and personally, Griffith's father served in the Civil War on the Confederate side, this film was produced to provide shock value or to stir up or reflect what was happening during the part of the 20th century?  Whatever the case, the United States was indeed going through a transformation both politically and socially under the hospices of president Woodrow Wilson.  Birth of a Nation was released in 1915, over 50 years after the end of the Civil War, and what better time was it to commemorate the end of the war?From a cinematic representation, the film authenticated the image of the Civil War.  Griffith appeared to be dead on with the battle scenes and the costumes.  Face value, one will think of the film as a disturbing racist representation and possibly a complete propaganda film for the KKK (as a result of the release of the film, the KKK rose and revived its membership).  Yes, that is true to many that have either heard or watched the film, but sadly was it a means of free speech and lack of censorship?  Griffith used a red color tinting effect on certain scenes where members of the KKK galloped like the seven horsemen of the apocalypse as well as the death of the soldiers on the field.  It is an eery assessment, but an effective one.  It presents an omninous representation as well as the horrible white makeup that the actors had to wear.The Birth of a Nation is a film that should be viewed and discussed.  It is especially a good learning tool that will help present the positive and negative perspectives that the Civil War generated.

396399,A2M66S05KKNSWC,630401967X,"Rivkah Maccaby ""Rivkah Maccaby""","[144, 181]","The Birth of a Nation is uniquely important to the history of cinema. The Birth of a Nation was the Birth of film as an independent medium, no longer just an off-shoot of theatre. Before The Birth of a Nation, films were shot from the proscenium perspective. Even the much touted Great Train Robbery was a flat film, the galloping horse scene being no more really than a running proscenium, and the rest of the film a stage set of a single car, with two actors, and all the train's riches in that one car.In making The Birth of a Nation, D.W. Griffith scrapped the proscenium entirely. Most of the film was shot from one of the character's point of view. The rest of the film was shot from a bird's eye view. Griffith, an original thinker, put the camera on a cherry picker.Scenes in The Birth of a Nation follow actors through a house, shows reaction shots, close ups of hands, of props. Characters read letters, then the camera shows the letter, the actor's face in reaction, the intertitle, then the letter again. Nothing like this had been done before.This is the historical importance of The Birth of a Nation. It won't be obvious to people in the 21st century who are not students of film, and some people may not find witnessing a slice of film history enough to spend four hours in front of the TV.However, this is a very effective film. The trick is getting a good print of it. If you have choice among different editions, choose the longest. You have the best chance of getting enough footage included to have a complete story, and a film that will be shown at the correct speed. Silent films of this vintage were shot at a different speed than sound films, which is why they so often look jerky and too fast when they are shown on an ordinary sound projector.Amazon offers eight or nine different prints of this film on video. They are of varying prices, and varying run times: I found run times of 124min., 125min., 158min., 159min., 190min., and 207min. although the prices don't increase incrementally with run time, the 207min. version is the most expensive. It's also listed as Black &amp; White and Color, which makes me suspect some of the original tinting may have been restored. Spend the money for the 207min. version. (I'll confess: I own an 8mm print.)Is the film racist? Yes; in fact, if you go to the Corcoran Gallery in Washington D.C. when there is a film memorabilia display, you can see a contemporaneous letter to Griffith from another film director asking Griffith to explain the racist overtones in the film. Griffith never answered the letter.Personally, I think Griffith explains himself well enough in his title at the opening of the film, when he writes of accepting responsibility and placing blame where it belongs.But the racism in the film is not in the triumphal ride of the KKK at the end of the film. This scene may look magnificent, and is a great piece of filmmaking: the reports that it inspired young men to join the KKK are doubtless true. However, the clan did occasionally have, for lack of a better word, &quot;celebrations&quot; like this, and Griffith is allowed to show it on film if he wants to.  The fact is that the ride is integral to the plot, but some people in attempt to tone down the racism have, when showing the film, cut a scene that makes clear what terrible thing the clansmen have done just before the ride.The Cameron family, a Southern family with fathers and sons on the rebel side, also have two daughters. One of the daughters, Flora, the cherished baby of the family, is stalked and attacked by a recently freed black man (the typical accusation of the clan). This is this crime that causes the clan to first take the law into its own hands in the Cameron's town. Representative clansmen let the Camerons know this, and of the coming triumphal parade through the town. The Camerons, less than pleased with vigilante justice, refuse to endorse the march. This isn't going to look so good, since Flora Cameron is their raison d'tre, and all. So the clansmen forcibly subdue and kidnap the Cameron's other daughter, Margaret, and sit her on the horse along with the clansman at the head of the March.The camera films the triumphal march from the front, with pathetic Margaret Cameron, looking half dead, half off the saddle, held tightly by the actor on the lead horse.So both the &quot;uppity&quot; blacks and the clansmen are not so different; each has appropriated a Cameron woman to its own purpose.Griffith's ultimate point, now that I'm finally getting to it, is to show the South in total disarray after the war. Newly freed black people are not getting their forty acres and a mule; they're not receiving education.Whether blacks ran amok in Restoration South or not is a question for historians; in the world of this film, they are running amok, because the North has broken all its promises to see to it that they are given the means to function as free people. The North has further broken its promises to help the South to rebuild.Griffith is saying that the after-war problems of the South, answered by vigilante justice, are not the result of Southerners being of weaker character than Northerners, but trace their pedigree to the bad faith of the North.That choosing to make this point using racist stereotypes, and playing people's fears is a good approach to making his point is certainly debatable; if for no other reason, it is certainly the reason that the film has trouble finding viewers today. But really... is it worse than Gone with the Wind?",5,History Written with Lightning (Woodrow Wilson),1007510400,"12 5, 2001",2001,5539,"['Birth', 'Nation', 'uniquely', 'important', 'history',

Graham,"[13, 15]","In 1915 the `National Association for the Advancement of Colored People` protested and published a 47 page pamphlet titled ""Fighting a Vicious Film: Protest Against The Birth of a Nation"".  The film was labelled `3 miles of filth`. Debate followed amongst censors as to whether it should even be shown at all in New York.  Woodrow Wilson to quote it correctly said the film was historically accurate and like ""History writ with lightning and my only regret is that it is all so terribly true""It must also be remembered that, like Wilson, this was an image many whites perceived to be true about blacks especially in the South and that it was an accurate portrayal of racial politics  in 1915. It sparked off massive race riots throughout America.The film was also the best recruitment product the KKK could ever hope for at any time in its history. Thanksgiving night, 1915 saw 25000 Klansmen parading the streets of Atlanta Georgia celebrating its opening.It has been said that Griffith was naive when it came to political matters and Griffith, himself the son of a Confederate soldier,  claimed his film was misunderstood (interesting the numbers of directors who say that when faced with massive criticism and controversy, Stanley Kubrick (Clockwork Orange), Oliver Stone (Natural Born Killers), Michael Winner (Death Wish and Death Wish 2) as examples.Birth of a Nation highlights how the perpetuation of a racial stereotype, however misguided,  can so strongly be manipulated by a powerful film.Personally, 90 years on,  I do not see that the, then, racially incorrect depiction of black people in Southern America in the aftermath of the civil war has the power to offend black people now. No one, maybe apart from twisted white supremacist groups or racist minorities with closed small minds, carries an image of black people any different  than any other race.The fact that the film is racist is in no doubt but it is just that; a film, like so many films that contain racist elements, its power to racially offend is now historic. I do not think anyone who watches Birth of a Nation is going to run along to the nearest KKK lodge donned in a white sheet and a cone on their head.Why didn`t native Americans riot and protest when Hollywood churned out hundreds of 7th Cavalry movies depicting the native indians as murderous rapists their slaughter of which for decades was glorified.What remains now of Birth of a Nation  is a technically magnificent, sweeping, racially flawed, but highly entertaining and beautifully crafted milestone in motion picture history. It is at times moving, at times exciting it is always enthrallingly watchable.KINO, as expected has produced another superb package.  The first generation 35mm image quality with natural print damage (which seems to add to its awe) is perfect and clear.  Such beautiful transfers largely inherent in KINO dvds makes watching silent movies a wonderful experience.  The sound track features the original, magnificent,  orchestral motion picture score recorded in superb digital stereo.There are also an array of excellent extras and historical notes and documents making the package the best version available .  One of the extras shows the scenes the New York censors cut which are all restored  in the film.

396403,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,630401967X,Robert J. Crawford,"[2, 2]","This is a truly amazing film, spanning the 15-year crucible surrounding the Civil War.  It is pioneering in its length, in the multiple narratives that play simultaneously, and in the most ambitious sets yet conceived.  The acting, in accordance with the silent-era melodrama, is absolutely first rate.  It is a spectacle both moving and irresistible.  This film demonstrated the power of the medium in entirely new ways, setting so innumerable precedents to explore and refine.  In my opinion, it is a work of genius.  Every image is like a romantic painting.  Unfortunately, its themes are so crudely racist and laden with grotesque stereotypes that I had to laugh.  The difference in mentality in the 100 years since it was made make it look as distant from our sensibilities as that of the middle ages.The film presents the south's version of the Civil War:  not only were they right to want to keep the obviously inferior blacks down, but their founding of the Ku Klux Klan was a holy and just corrective to the excesses imposed on them by meddling northern radicals.  They are not terrorists but liberators, preventing lascivious mulattoes from raping virginal white beauties.This is a film experience that every cinofile should own and that school children can discuss in context.",5,must-have classic in spite of the blatant racism,1364515200,"03 29, 2013",2013,1287,"['truly', 'amazing', 'film', 'spanning', '15-year', 'crucible', 'surrounding', 'Civil', 'War', 'pioneering', 'length', 'multiple', 'narratives', 'play', 'simultaneously', 'most', 'ambitious', 'sets', 'yet', 'conceived', 'acting', 'accordance', 'silent-era', 'melodrama', 'absolutely', 'first', 'rate', 'spectacle', 'moving', 'irresistible', 'film', 'demonstrated', 'power', 'medium', 'entirely', 'new', 'ways', 'setting', 'so', 'innumerable', 'precedents', 'explore', 'refine', 'opinion', 'work', 'genius', 'image', 'romantic', 'painting', 'Unfortunately', 'themes', 'are', 'so', 'crudely', 'racist', 'laden', 'grotesque', 'stereotypes', 'had', 'laugh', 'difference', 'mentality', '100', 'years', 'was', 'made', 'make', 'look', 'distant', 'sensibilities', 'middle', 'ages.The', 'film', 'south', 'version', 'Civil', 'War', 'not', 'only', 'were', 'right', 'want', 'keep', 'obviously', 'inferior', 'blacks', 'down', 'founding', 'Ku', 'Klux', 'Klan', 'was', 'holy', 'just', 'corrective', 'excesses', 'imposed', 'meddling', 'northern', 'radicals', 'are', 'not', 'terrorists', 'liberators', 'preventing', 'lascivious', 'mulattoes', 'raping', 'virginal', 'white', 'beauties.This', 'film', 'experience', 'cinofile', 'should', 'own', 'school', 'children', 'can', 'discuss', 'context']",N/A

In a way its too bad Griffith did not end the film with the conclusion of the Civil War.  This would have made for a shorter, tighter film without all the bizarre stuff of the latter part.Even as a Civil War film there is a lot lacking here.  The classic friends and brother against brother film is shown here and its a theme that the movies would use many times again.  The battle scene showing Peterburg seems an odd choice to show on film.  Since this is an epic showing the whole Civil War it seems strange that Griffith decides to show such a late battle in the conflict.  There is no Bull Run, or even Gettysburg shown here.  The Petersburg scene is well done, although rather choatic looking.  Too much smoke almost obscures the set sometimes, and while this is a period detail it leads to visual confusion.  There are also a lot of guys standing around waving Union or Rebel flags in the middle of the battlefield.  I doubt this was done in actuality.Perhaps one of the reasons where Griffith chose Peterburg as his battle for the film is that this seige closely resembled the trenches of WW1.  At the time of BIRTHS release in 1915 the war was waging in Europe and America's entry was only a few years away.  Petersburg with its seige lines was a precursor of WW1 battlefields and perhaps Griffith wanted to show this.The second half of the film is a bizarre look at events associated with Reconstruction in the South.  There can be no doubt that if Lincoln had lived things would have been a lot better for the defeated South.  This film seems to imply that with his death the North betrayed Lincoln's promise to bring the nation back together again.  Radicals did seek to take advantage of the strickend South and Blacks were used as a means to exploit the situation.  But Griffith's take on all of this is pretty odd.  Romanticizing the KKK seems a strange way to do homage to the sacrefices of the Civil War.  Again, if Griffith had ended the film sooner it would have been a more balanced work.  Still, the influence of BIRTH on Hollywood's view of the Civil War would be profound, and remains so even to today.  An imperfect epic that is worth watching for its historical interest, but should not be taken too seriously as a perspective on American history.",4,Racial Classic of the Civil War,1222732800,"09 30, 2008",2008,2351,"['What', 'opus', 'worthwhile', 'significance', 'study', 'early', 'film', 'way', 'too', 'bad', 'Griffith', 'did', 'not', 'end', 'film', 'conclusion', 'Civil', 'War', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'shorter', 'tighter', 'film', 'bizarre', 'stuff', 'latter', 'part.Even', 'Civil', 'War', 'film', 'lot', 'lacking', 'here', 'classic', 'friends', 'brother', 'brother', 'film', 'shown', 'here', 'theme', 'movies', 'would', 'use', 'many', 'times', 'again', 'battle', 'scene', 'showing', 'Peterburg', 'odd', 'choice', 'show', 'film', 'epic', 'showing', 'whole', 'Civil', 'War', 'strange', 'Griffith', 'show', 'such', 'late', 'battle', 'conflict', 'Bull', 'Run', 'even', 'Gettysburg', 'shown', 'here', 'Petersburg', 'scene', 'well', 'done', 'rather', 'choatic', 'looking', 'Too', 'much', 'smoke', 'almost', 'set', 'sometimes', 'period', 'detail', 'visual', 'confusion', 'are', 'also', 'lot', 'guys', 'standing', 'waving', 'Union', 'Rebel', 'flags', 'middle', 'battlefield', 'doubt', 'was', 'done', 'actuality.Perhaps', 'one', 'reasons', 'where', 'Griffith', 'chose', 'Peterburg', 'battle', 'film', 'seige', 'closely', 'resembled', 'trenches', 'WW1', 'time', 'BIRTHS', 'release', '1915', 'war', 'was', 'waging', 'Europe', 'America', 'entry', 'was', 'only', 'few', 'years', 'away', 'Petersburg', 'seige', 'lines', 'was', 'precursor', 'WW1', 'battlefields', 'perhaps', 'Griffith', 'wanted', 'show', 'this.The', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'bizarre', 'look', 'events', 'associated', 'Reconstruction', 'South', 'can', 'be', 'doubt', 'Lincoln', 'had', 'lived', 'things', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'defeated', 'South', 'film', 'imply', 'death', 'North', 'betrayed', 'Lincoln', 'promise', 'bring', 'nation', 'back', 'together', 'again', 'Radicals', 'did', 'seek', 'take', 'advantage', 'strickend', 'South', 'Blacks', 'were', 'used', 'means', 'exploit', 'situation', 'Griffith', 'take', 'pretty', 'odd', 'Romanticizing', 'KKK', 'strange', 'way', 'do', 'homage', 'sacrefices', 'Civil', 'War', 'Again', 'Griffith', 'had', 'ended', 'film', 'sooner', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'balanced', 'work', 'Still', 'influence', 'BIRTH', 'Hollywood', 'view', 'Civil', 'War', 'would', 'be', 'profound', 'so', 'even', 'today', 'imperfect', 'epic', 'worth', 'watching', 'historical', 'interest', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'taken', 'too', 'seriously', 'perspective', 'American', 'history']",N/A

It is a classic story of the Civil War, told from the South's point of view (controversial at the time and still so today).  ""Birth of a Nation"" tells the story of two families, one from the North and the other from the South, whose friendships and loves are tested by the war and its tragic aftermaths.One of the greatest actors of all time, Henry B. Walthall, portrays Ben Cameron (The Little Colonel) with both physical and romantic grace.  His character is a soldier, a son, a brother, an avenger, and a lover.  He plays each of these sub-roles with dignity and skill not seen much in Hollywood these days.  A beautiful and delicate Lillian Gish plays Elsie Stoneman, the woman he loved without even meeting her at first.  Mae Marsh is delightful and tragic as the ill-fated Flora, Ben's little sister.  Other noteworthy performances given are Joseph Henabery as an uncanny and kindhearted Abraham Lincoln; Ralph Lewis as the stubborn and powerhungry Austin Stoneman; the classic beauty Miriam Cooper as Margaret Cameron; and George Siegmann as the mulatto villain Silas Lynch.This film has romance, action, drama, and even some bits of humor as well.

Mae Marsh is somewhat affecting, given how badly written her role is, and Henry B. Walthall is rather dynamic and expressive, but the first half of the film is a slow-moving, silly melodrama, with a few good battle scenes. The second half of the film is... tripe, with Griffith blatantly covering his tracks (note the caption about the state house scene based on a photo is of a different time than the scene takes place--which cuts to an empty courthouse before dissolving to racist shenanigans).This was used as a Klan recruitment film in the seventies, a testament to its vehement racism. I'm surprised audiences didn't walk out in the tedious first part (Griffith made far better films, before and after, by the way--his short films hold up quite well as period pieces).The problem is that this was the first epic feature film in the U.S., although feature films date back several years prior, even in the U.S., and epic features had been popular in Europe. After the premiere there was a huge lynching of black people, a fact many film historians want to supress or simply don't know. To top it off, only the minor black characters in the film actually are black, the major ones in ridiculous-looking blackface, the contrast making the film all the more disturbing, especially when the film retains Thoms Dixon's severe fear of miscegenation, or specifically, of black men raping white women, when that was exceedingly rare. Many critics at the time thought Griffith tempered out the racism of the Dixon novel and play (_The Clansman_) he based it on (recognized even then as bigoted propoganda)...I can neither like nor recommend this film, though there are many silent melodramas I do like, this is most definitely not one of them, a cruel joke on everybody, and really an uncharacteristic work from Griffith, who, for the most part was a truly great filmmaker, and 490 of his 495 films (mostly shorts) survive to prove it. It's a shame he is best remembered for one of his worst films, which really deserves a two for the few good qualities I have mentioned (it loses points for overshadowing Griffith's best work), but it really is a terrible film, both in terms of entertaining qualities (or lack thereof), offensive qualities, and a technical polish far below that of Griffith's shorts.",1,Auggghhh!,1009411200,"12 27, 2001",2001,2366,"['had', 'watch', 'film', 'graduate', 'cinema', 'course', 'hated', 'Mae', 'Marsh', 'somewhat', 'affecting', 'given', 'how', 'badly', 'written', 'role', 'Henry', 'B.', 'Walthall', 'rather', 'dynamic', 'expressive', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'slow-moving', 'silly', 'melodrama', 'few', 'good', 'battle', 'scenes', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'tripe', 'Griffith', 'blatantly', 'covering', 'tracks', 'note', 'caption', 'state', 'house', 'scene', 'based', 'photo', 'different', 'time', 'scene', 'place', 'empty', 'courthouse', 'dissolving', 'racist', 'shenanigans', '.This', 'was', 'used', 'Klan', 'recruitment', 'film', 'seventies', 'testament', 'vehement', 'racism', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'audiences', 'did', ""n't"", 'walk', 'out', 'tedious', 'first', 'part', 'Griffith', 'made', 'far', 'better', 'films', 'way', 'short', 'films', 'hold', 'up', 'quite', 'well', 'period', 'pieces', '.The', 'problem', 'was', 'first', 'epic', 'feature', 'film', 'U.S.', 'feature', 'films', 'date', 'back', 'several', 'years', 'prior', 'even', 'U.S.', 'epic', 'features', 'had', 'been', 'popular', 'Europe', 'premiere', 'there', 'was', 'huge', 'lynching', 'black', 'people', 'fact', 'many', 'film', 'historians', 'want', 'supress', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'top', 'off', 'only', 'minor', 'black', 'characters', 'film', 'actually', 'are', 'black', 'major', 'ones', 'ridiculous-looking', 'blackface', 'contrast', 'making', 'film', 'more', 'disturbing', 'especially', 'when', 'film', 'Thoms', 'Dixon', 'severe', 'fear', 'miscegenation', 'specifically', 'black', 'men', 'raping', 'white', 'women', 'when', 'was', 'exceedingly', 'rare', 'Many', 'critics', 'time', 'thought', 'Griffith', 'tempered', 'out', 'racism', 'Dixon', 'novel', 'play', '_The', 'Clansman_', 'based', 'recognized', 'even', 'then', 'bigoted', 'propoganda', 'can', 'like', 'recommend', 'film', 'are', 'many', 'silent', 'melodramas', 'do', 'most', 'definitely', 'not', 'one', 'cruel', 'joke', 'everybody', 'really', 'uncharacteristic', 'work', 'Griffith', 'who', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'truly', 'great', 'filmmaker', '490', '495', 'films', 'mostly', 'survive', 'prove', 'shame', 'best', 'remembered', 'one', 'worst', 'films', 'really', 'two', 'few', 'good', 'qualities', 'have', 'mentioned', 'points', 'overshadowing', 'Griffith', 'best', 'work', 'really', 'terrible', 'film', 'terms', 'entertaining', 'qualities', 'lack', 'thereof', 'offensive', 'qualities', 'technical', 'polish', 'far', 'Griffith', 'shorts']",N/A

396409,AUV0EFKWA46TX,630401967X,shaxper,"[14, 15]","It is often suggested that the only way to appreciate D.W. Griffith's masterfully executed romanticism of the Klu Klux Klan is to separate his art from its incredibly disturbing messages. After all, what begins as a seemingly tame but slightly offensive retelling of the Civil War slowly gives way to depictions of freed African Americans abducting and/or attempting to rape nearly every woman in the film while staging a coupe to create a new ""Black South,"" all while backed by their complacent and foolish abolitionist supporters. It's enough to make most of us sick. Still, I think there's a power in viewing such ugliness, and I believe that, when it comes to ""Birth of a Nation,"" the misguided message is a crucial part of the film's power.One of the comments that I hear often from people viewing this film without knowing its background is that it takes them a long while to realize there's something blatantly disturbing about its messages. The writing, camera work, and especially the acting all work hard to make us love and side with the Stoneman family at first. We actually find ourselves sympathizing with the South and their plight to remain sovereign states. We question the North's stubbornness and are truly moved as cousin is turned against cousin for the sake of foolish ideological differences. ""The Little Colonel,"" in particular, wins us over as a figure of great virtue and nobility. We love him instantly, and the old South along with him.Of course, all of us come to our realizations about the film's true nature, but each at different times. Some of us are offended beyond the ability to sympathize, right off the bat, by Griffith's implication that the trouble began when Africans first came to America. For many of us, though, this offense takes place far later in the film. For me, it was over an hour in when ""The Little Colonel"" indignantly refused to shake a freed black man's hand. Others might even take longer, perhaps not seeing a problem until ""The Little Colonel"" dons his full KKK attire, or until the Klan holds their own impromptu trial for a freed slave suspected of murder, and the following title card triumphantly proclaims ""GUILTY!""And there's the true point and power of the film for me. It forces us to question assumptions and opinions that we hold dear and normally never think to examine. Most of us will agree that the North was the just side in the Civil War without batting an eye, most of us believe that blacks and whites are equal, and all of us believe that slavery was wrong, yet we never truly explore these ideas. I know far too many people who hold these same ideals that you and I do, yet they shudder when a black family moves into a home on their block or when a black person wins public office in an election. They know the right ideals to preach (these ideals have been programmed into our heads since childhood), but they don't truly understand these ideals, or at least have never really thought about them.It's for that reason that I think we need films like this one to challenge us, to almost lure us in and then force us to question our own attitudes and beliefs in reaction. We all need to look at images like the one of ""The Little Colonel"" shooting an unarmed black man while he's still on the ground, or the one of the KKK members standing menacingly over the cowering freed slaves attempting to vote at the election booth, and ask ourselves WHY these images are wrong and disturbing.  Hopefully, the answer that follows can help us to better love our neighbors in this day and age that is still saturated with a far more subtle, hidden racism.I hate how this film made me feel, but I savor that terrible and uncomfortable experience; I love that it shook my foundations and forced me to truly examine my belief system. Even with all of the film's lies and historical inaccuracies**, it truly challenges us and compels us to look inward. I believe we've made enough progress as a civilization that no one's going to watch this film and then go out and join the KKK (though, back in 1915, it was a different story). All of us have that moment where we realize that what we're watching is unacceptable. I think the only people who have reason to fear and hate this film are either those who have little faith in the ability of others to see through the film's misguided ideology, or those who do not want to be challenged for fear that their own idealogy isn't strong enough to stand up against it.For the rest, this is an opportunity to strengthen our beliefs by having them attacked for once. We're all prepared to tell you why our favorite candidate is the best man/woman for the job, or why our favorite sports team is the best, because there are discussions and debates happening amongst two or more sides in those matters. No one discusses WHY racism is wrong because we all agree that it is. There's no one else to convince of this opinion, so we never bother to explain it to ourselves or to explore what it really means to believe in equality. This needs to be corrected.Birth of a Nation is a cinematically beautiful film; well done in all but one obvious respect. Still, I don't think style, technique, and acting ability are enough to make a film great. Great art, in all its forms, challenges and transforms, and you can ask for few greater challenges than the ones brought forth in ""Birth of a Nation."" Don't ignore the message of this film; invite its challenges and seize the opportunity to reexamine your own beliefs in contrast. Trust that you'll come out a stronger and better person in the end.** ""The Little Colonel"" loosely resembles George Gordan, a confederate soldier turned early Klan member in Pulaski, Tennessee.

The opening and closing scenes hint at a movie that will make a serious statement against all wars.  And the battle scenes in part one, including hospital recovery, are superb.  This is a movie that has the power to move and enrage audiences 92 years after it was made, so I consider it an important film classic.  I particularly am moved by hero Henry B. Walthall's return home from war to his sweetheart Mae Marsh, the scenes with Abraham Lincoln, and the impeccable re-creation of Ford's Theater on the night Lincoln was shot.  Miriam Cooper and Lillian Gish are also unforgettably poignant. So there is a lot to recommend to even black audiences nowadays, mostly in part one.If only Griffith had stopped at the 85 minute intermission point, he would have had a true masterpiece.  What on earth was he thinking in the remaining 100 minutes when he turns the movie into infuriating melodrama and the cinema of propaganda?  (The Kino archive print I watched, the definitive one to buy or rent, runs 187 minutes, with color tinting and an orchestra score.)  The Civil War is over, and the black characters are in control (and mostly played by white actors in blackface).  The blacks are in control of Congress, will not let whites vote, and unwittingly kill the lovely (white) Mae Marsh character.The logical and needed solution, for Griffith, is to have Walthall form the Ku Klux Klan to avenge his sweetheart's death and let the South not be under the power of the evil and all-powerful blacks.  This is when BIRTH OF A NATION becomes the infuriating cinema of propaganda.  I found myself getting all worked up and wanting all blacks on screen to meet a violent death.  When a whole army of KKK riders faces down a whole street of blacks, you cheer for the KKK  to kill all the blacks and restore order.  And they eventually do.BIRTH OF A NATION is a powerful and important film, despite its disturbing racism, because of its vast scope and its brilliant filmmaking.  It maintains interest for over three hours, has beautifully drawn and heartbreaking white major characters (again, especially, the three women), stunning battle scenes on a movie determined to make a timely statement to end all wars forever, and parallel cutting between blacks and whites in the admittedly exciting climax.  I'm not sure, but I think parallel editing was invented here, along with iris camerawork.  (All you see on screen is a circle or some other geometric shape.)  And there is again the mammoth length--187 minutes, plus intermission--at a time when Keaton was not yet on screen and Keystone was making 20-25 minute slapstick comedies with Chaplin and Arbuckle.  Griffith, with BIRTH, basically invented the modern cinema; and 92 years later we are still arguing over its merits and admittedly finding its pro-KKK climax blood-racingly exciting because of Griffith's melodramatic storytelling.  You are not allowed to cheer for the blacks.The NAACP will not allow BIRTH OF A NATION to be shown theatrically anymore.  Too bad.  As a white guy I'd love to see it with a predominately black audience.  Fortunately, we can still see it on DVD versions ranging from only 90 minutes, to Kino's definitive 187 minute roadshow version with color tinting and an orchestra score.  Kino also gives us the 1930 chat with D. W. Griffith and Walter Huston on Griffith's intentions with BIRTH; a 25 minute behind-the-scenes documentary; scenes from the roadshow souvenir program; fascinating legal/censorship records; and several Griffith Civil War shorts he made at Biograph Studios before BIRTH.Watch BIRTH OF A NATION with a sober head, some intelligence, and in the greatest possible print.  92 years later it is a masterpiece of propaganda that still has the power to enrage, excite, disturb, and move modern audiences as few silent films do.",5,A deeply troubling and maybe brilliant film classic,1170547200,"02 4, 2007",2007,3909,"['D.W.', 'Griffith', 'THE', 'BIRTH', 'A', 'NATION', '1915', 'deeply', 'troubles', 'white', 'caucasian', 'opening', 'closing', 'scenes', 'hint', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'serious', 'statement', 'wars', 'battle', 'scenes', 'part', 'one', 'including', 'hospital', 'recovery', 'are', 'superb', 'movie', 'power', 'move', 'enrage', 'audiences', '92', 'years', 'was', 'made', 'consider', 'important', 'film', 'classic', 'particularly', 'am', 'moved', 'hero', 'Henry', 'B.', 'Walthall', 'return', 'home', 'war', 'sweetheart', 'Mae', 'Marsh', 'scenes', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'impeccable', 're-creation', 'Ford', 'Theater', 'night', 'Lincoln', 'was', 'shot', 'Miriam', 'Cooper', 'Lillian', 'Gish', 'are', 'also', 'unforgettably', 'poignant', 'lot', 'recommend', 'even', 'black', 'audiences', 'nowadays', 'mostly', 'part', 'only', 'Griffith', 'had', 'stopped', '85', 'minute', 'intermission', 'point', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'true', 'masterpiece', 'What', 'earth', 'was', 'thinking', 'remaining', '100', 'minutes', 'when', 'movie', 'infuriating', 'melodrama', 'cinema', 'propaganda', 'Kino', 'archive', 'print', 'watched', 'definitive', 'one', 'buy', 'rent', '187', 'minutes', 'color', 'tinting', 'orchestra', 'score', 'Civil', 'War', 'black', 'characters', 'are', 'control', 'mostly', 'played', 'white', 'actors', 'blackface', 'blacks', 'are', 'control', 'Congress', 'will', 'not', 'let', 'whites', 'vote', 'unwittingly', 'kill', 'lovely', 'white', 'Mae', 'Marsh', 'character.The', 'logical', 'needed', 'solution', 'Griffith', 'have', 'Walthall', 'form', 'Ku', 'Klux', 'Klan', 'avenge', 'sweetheart', 'death', 'let', 'South', 'not', 'be', 'power', 'evil', 'all-powerful', 'blacks', 'when', 'BIRTH', 'A', 'NATION', 'infuriating', 'cinema', 'propaganda', 'found', 'getting', 'worked', 'up', 'wanting', 'blacks', 'screen', 'meet', 'violent', 'death', 'When', 'whole', 'army', 'KKK', 'riders', 'down', 'whole', 'street', 'blacks', 'cheer', 'KKK', 'kill', 'blacks', 'restore', 'order', 'eventually', 'do.BIRTH', 'NATION', 'powerful', 'important', 'film', 'disturbing', 'racism', 'vast', 'scope', 'brilliant', 'filmmaking', 'interest', 'three', 'hours', 'beautifully', 'drawn', 'heartbreaking', 'white', 'major', 'characters', 'again', 'especially', 'three', 'women', 'stunning', 'battle', 'scenes', 'movie', 'determined', 'make', 'timely', 'statement', 'end', 'wars', 'forever', 'parallel', 'cutting', 'blacks', 'whites', 'admittedly', 'exciting', 'climax', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'think', 'parallel', 'editing', 'was', 'invented', 'here', 'iris', 'camerawork', 'see', 'screen', 'circle', 'other', 'geometric', 'shape', 'again', 'mammoth', 'length', '187', 'minutes', 'intermission', 'time', 'when', 'Keaton', 'was', 'not', 'yet', 'screen', 'Keystone', 'was', 'making', '20-25', 'minute', 'slapstick', 'comedies', 'Chaplin', 'Arbuckle', 'Griffith', 'BIRTH', 'basically', 'invented', 'modern', 'cinema', '92', 'years', 'later', 'are', 'still', 'arguing', 'merits', 'admittedly', 'finding', 'pro-KKK', 'climax', 'blood-racingly', 'exciting', 'Griffith', 'melodramatic', 'storytelling', 'are', 'not', 'allowed', 'cheer', 'blacks.The', 'NAACP', 'will', 'not', 'allow', 'BIRTH', 'A', 'NATION', 'be', 'shown', 'theatrically', 'anymore', 'Too', 'bad', 'white', 'guy', ""'d"", 'love', 'see', 'predominately', 'black', 'audience', 'Fortunately', 'can', 'still', 'see', 'DVD', 'versions', 'ranging', 'only', '90', 'minutes', 'Kino', 'definitive', '187', 'minute', 'roadshow', 'version', 'color', 'tinting', 'orchestra', 'score', 'Kino', 'also', '1930', 'chat', 'D.', 'W.', 'Griffith', 'Walter', 'Huston', 'Griffith', 'intentions', 'BIRTH', '25', 'minute', 'behind-the-scenes', 'documentary', 'scenes', 'roadshow', 'souvenir', 'program', 'fascinating', 'legal/censorship', 'records', 'several', 'Griffith', 'Civil', 'War', 'made', 'Biograph', 'Studios', 'BIRTH.Watch', 'BIRTH', 'A', 'NATION', 'sober', 'head', 'intelligence', 'greatest', 'possible', 'print', '92', 'years', 'later', 'masterpiece', 'propaganda', 'still', 'power', 'enrage', 'excite', 'disturb', 'move', 'modern', 'audiences', 'few', 'silent', 'films', 'do']",N/A

In fact, the reason I have bought a copy of the DVD is that the department's old video copy is worn out by now from the number of times it's been used in class. By every possible moral measure, this movie is incredibly offensive, with its crude racial stereotypes, its rewriting of American history to portray white Southerners as the ""victims"" of Blacks who claimed their political rights as voting citizens after the Civil War, and its glorification of the Ku Klux Klan.  And it can't be dismissed as ""just a movie,"" because its release had real consequences, leading to race riots, lynchings, and worst of all, the re-formation of the Klan, which had almost entirely died out before the movie was released.And yet, as any historian of cinema can tell you, it was technically and artistically a landmark, the first movie epic, the first really ambitious effort at complex story-telling and spectacle in the new medium.  Every movie epic that has been made since then owes something to this film.  All of this makes for some very lively classroom discussions: should this movie still be shown to public audiences?  If someone wanted to show it on this campus as part of a program on the history of cinema, would you support their right to show it, or would you protest the use of your tuition and fees for a purpose like that?

Enough people have said this is a racist film that portrays blacks badly and glorifies the Ku Klux Klan that I don't need to repeat those words.  Rather, I have a question to ask that gets overlooked but that I argue we should be asking: what was Mr. D. W. Griffith's intention with this film, and why, given that, did he choose to make the kind of film that he did?Right at the beginning he makes it clear via an inter-title what his intent is with this film: it is meant to be an anti-war film, and the specific war that it is anti is the War Between the States (1861-1865).  It is clear based on the story being told here that Mr. Griffith laments that the Union broke up, and more so that friends went to war against one another, and so much suffering was endured by soldiers and civilians alike, and that families were torn apart.  And, perhaps unlike many modern filmmakers, he also recognizes that ceasefire doesn't automatically lead to peace but can instead lead to resentment and lingering hostilities on the part of both belligerents.So then, why did he choose to make this particular film?  Let us not stoop to the level of prejudice ourselves and call him a racist without bothering to determine his motives based on what he portrays and what he has said about his views on the subject matter.  He denied being a racist--it would be the height of hypocritical stupidity to have made a romance about the Ku Klux Klan and then deny being a racist unless he was telling the truth, at least as he saw it.  So if we are willing to be charitable, and thereby make ourselves vulnerable so that we might look in the mirror and see white hoods over our own faces that we didn't know were there, what might we find?This is speculation on my part, and speculation on Mr. Griffith's views alone, but based on the evidence it seems to me to be the best explanation for the mystery here: why did a man who said he wasn't racist make a romance glorifying the Ku Klux Klan--and why did the author of the book on which it was based oppose the revived 20th-century Klan where he so supported the original 19th-century Klan?  My speculation is that, true or false, people like Thomas Dixon (the author of the novel The Clansman, on which this film was based) and D. W. Griffith, the director of this film, saw the Ku Klux Klan at its heart as being nothing more or less than a (necessarily extralegal) restoration movement and protection for those who couldn't protect themselves.I'll explain: the ""fiery cross"" that we so associate with the Klan now actually does not predate the book The Clansman as far as I know in terms of the KKK using it--it was in that book but was not used by the original KKK.  However, it was used in Scotland as a call to arms to the various Scottish clans and their men (""clansmen"").  In fact, it was used by Bonnie Prince Charlie (a Catholic member of the Scottish House of Stuart) when, in 1745, he tried to claim his rightful place on the British throne from the usurper George II, who was German-born, not British-born.  Granted, the House of Hanover were only the beneficiaries of the deposing of the Jacobites, not technically the guilty parties themselves, but they were still occupying a throne that rightfully belonged to the Jacobites.  And it is true that many white Southerners trace their ancestry back to Scotland.  Indeed, the Confederate flag has a Saint Andrew's cross (the X-shaped cross) on it, just like the Scottish flag does.In short, my suspicion is that the original 19th-century Ku Klux Klan was seen by Mr. Dixon and Mr. Griffith, rightly or wrongly, as a restoration movement similar to the one that followed Bonnie Prince Charlie.  The only difference is that the Southern States have been republican since independence, not monarchical, so that sovereignty rested not in an individual monarch but in a collective, each male individual of whom had an equal vote and equal eligibility to run for office.  Before the War Between the States, that meant males descended from settlers from the British Isles, Germany, etc.: white men.  That might sound racist and sexist to us today but I don't necessarily believe it was meant to be at the time: it was men only because they were the heads of the families, voting on behalf of their entire families.  As for it being white men?  Well, the first 13 States were originally British colonies, and the British are white.  It's no different from an African republic resting its sovereignty in black men--it isn't racist, it just makes it clear where sovereignty rests given a republic instead of a monarchy.  Not only where it is but where it isn't, which makes all the difference between patriotism and treason: sovereignty is necessary but it also must necessarily not belong to everyone: if it belongs to everyone, it belongs to no one; if it belongs to no one, it is up for grabs; if it is up for grabs, anyone who seizes it and keeps it from others gets it--and that's a dictatorship.And while legally, the 15th Amendment (which apparently was unconstitutional, as by 1870 the Constitution didn't give the federal government the authority to expand suffrage in this way) merely expanded sovereignty to include black men (really to include all male American citizens irrespective of color), in reality in the former Confederate States, white Confederate soldiers who were accused of being traitors were disenfranchised, and so in practice in the South, sovereignty was taken away from white men and given to black men instead, not in addition to.  Black men did not usurp it for themselves, and to the credit of this story it does not paint black people as the villains (except for Gus--I don't really count Silas Lynch because he is mulatto, not technically black), but rather the Radical Republicans who manipulated black people to get what they wanted, which was to gain and keep power and punish the South more than they'd already been punished.  The point is, it's a similar situation to British sovereignty being usurped from the Jacobites for the House of Hanover, even though the Hanoverians only benefited but did not usurp: likewise, sovereignty in the Southern States was usurped from the collective of white men for the collective of black men, even though the black men only benefited but did not usurp.  Therefore, irrespective of whether this is historically accurate, I surmise that Mr. Dixon and Mr. Griffith meant to portray the KKK as a restoration movement, an attempt to restore sovereignty to where it had been since independence: with white men, and white men alone--that and of course as protectors of the elderly, women, and children from those who might threaten them (as they were threatened during the war itself--that is historical fact).This also accounts for the marriage laws being mentioned here: it's little different from laws allowing common men to marry princesses.  And while any man and woman can get married as long as both are eligible (neither is married to someone else already) and as long as both are willing, the latter stipulation is not in vogue here.  Are we really post-racist if we see men trying to force women to marry them against their will and we're upset at the women instead of the men because the men happen not to be white, while the women are?  Would we be considering Belle the villain if Gaston were black, or mulatto?In any case, the sovereignty question is an important one because it makes all the difference between patriotism and treason.  That's why, once it is established, it ought to be respected and preserved, however it is, and not be subject to radical changes all the time--then it's very unclear where it rests and so it is unclear who is a patriot and who is a traitor.  That paves the way for either a civil war (with the winner deciding where sovereignty was all along and hence the winners are the patriots and the losers are the traitors) or a dictatorship.My question isn't what the 19th-century Klan was actually like, but how Mr. Dixon and Mr. Griffith saw it, and why they romanticized it--especially when they did not feel similarly about the 20th-century Klan.  Other than the possibility that they might not have encountered the 19th-century Klan themselves, that suggests that there was an appreciable difference with the revived Klan--for the worse--at least in the perception of Mr. Dixon and Mr. Griffith.  Again, I don't know enough about it to say exactly what that difference for the worse was, or is.  Clearly, though, they felt the 20th-century Klan was not a genuine successor to the 19th-century Klan, or they would have been happy at the revival as a result of this film.  The fact that they were not ought to give us pause and prompt us to ask why, especially since that does not seem to be the attitude of a mere white supremacist.In any case, only thinking about it that way can I appreciate the story being told here.  And while this film doesn't technically suggest that Jesus supports the Klan, it is meant to be from a pro-Christian (possibly Protestant rather than Catholic) perspective, and it also depicts the KKK as a good, or at worst as a necessary evil.  In any case, I didn't have the heart to knock off more than one star for that for two reasons: first, this is such a well-made and influential film, and it deserves that much respect at least.  Much of the film language we take for granted today was begun by Mr. Griffith in films like this--and one thing I love about all silent films is that they know their medium: film arose out of photography, and so mise-en-scene is important, not just dialogue, score, and sound effects.  Indeed, this film is deliberately inspired by Mathew Brady's actual photographs from the real time period.  (Indeed, it feels as close as I'll probably ever come to seeing actual footage of the real war.)  Second, I do not blame Mr. Dixon or Mr. Griffith for the revival of the Ku Klux Klan or what the revived Klan has taught, said, or done, especially since the artists did not condone the new Klan.In short, that is how I surmise Mr. Griffith saw his own film, and whether he was right or wrong is a historical question that I don't know enough to answer: he meant for it to be an anti-war film, lamenting the breakup of the Union and the war and its aftermath, hoping for peace, liberty, and union for the United States of America.  He used actual photographs as inspiration for his dramatized vignettes in the process and used an original film language which inspires film to this day.  And whether he was right or wrong, I surmise he saw the Ku Klux Klan (at least in its Reconstruction origins) as a restoration movement, trying to do no more than to restore sovereignty (albeit necessarily by force, outside of the new law, as vigilantes) to those who had held it before the war, removing it from those for whom it had been usurped, in order to make it clear where sovereignty rested and therefore where patriotism and treason truly lay, lest a patriot be treated as a traitor or a traitor imagine himself a patriot.  That and men to protect their families.  Only thus can I explain how the KKK parading through the streets and successfully intimidating black men away from the polls can be seen as a happy ending in keeping with the film's intended message (and given that D. W. Griffith denied being racist): sovereignty has been restored, at least in practice if not yet in the law (since the KKK is still practicing intimidation), and the way has been paved for reconciliation between the North and the South, signified by the double marriage at the end.  There is no clear ending, as there cannot be because this is a historical film, but that's the story he chose to tell.To conclude, while we must not turn a blind eye to the real crimes of the Ku Klux Klan in any form, we run the risk of being no better (at least in kind) if we merely denounce this film and the book on which it was based, and the artists that produced them, as racist and leave it at that.  (Or for that matter, if we do the same for the actual Klan and its members.)  That's uncharitable, cowardly and hypocritical.  Jesus Christ wants us to love our enemies: love even the Klansman who hates you because you're of the ""wrong race"" and who would rather die than owe his life to you--and who would gladly kill you if he got the opportunity.  Only then is our love unconditional, and therefore only then is our love pure.  Love the sinner, hate the sin--but love the sinner first, before we hate the sin, and hate the sin because we love the sinner and we hate what the sin is doing to our brother.  Let us remove the masks over our own faces before we remove the masks of the Klansmen.P. S.  It has just come to my attention that the KKK (even the 19th-century original) was founded by Freemasons.  What I say above about being charitable to people still holds, and always will, but now I am convinced that even in its original 19th-century form, the KKK was probably bad news.  Indeed, D. W. Griffith was himself a Freemason.  While probably most Freemasons themselves don't know it (that being the nature of a secret society), Freemasonry is an anti-Christian cult that at its highest levels worships the Devil.  And while that doesn't necessarily mean the one has anything to do with the other, it means there is at least the possibility.  So it seems to me to be just Mr. Dixon's and Mr. Griffith's beliefs, not the reality, that the KKK was just a restoration movement and nothing worse--though that doesn't mean it didn't get worse in the 20th century, nor does it mean that many of our founding fathers were not Freemasons (George Washington and Benjamin Franklin, for example, and several later Presidents).  And to be fair, by the time both men were adults the original KKK was gone, so they may not have known better anyway.  It's just hard to say because, if white male sovereignty was disrespected, does that mean that those who disrespected it were guilty of treason and so deserved to be treated as traitors?  And if so, did the 19th-century KKK act in that capacity alone or did it go too far (as I suspect it's the latter)?  I believe that a monarchy is the best form of government--but if so, then would Jesus support a republican restoration movement (at least in conception), especially one that wasn't trying to bring about any monarchies?P. P. S.  Well, I should be careful of what I say.  I still think the above is a caveat but the Democratic Party itself was founded by a Freemason: President Andrew Jackson.  And while the Democratic Party has certainly become evil today, and being a man-made organization was never perfect, I think originally it was less bad, before the 20th century, if not as good as it might have been.  At least, most Catholics joined that party, and why would they do that if it was innately contrary to their faith, if there was nothing salvageable about it even at the core?  Even His Holiness Pope Pius IX was on friendly terms with Jefferson Davis and informally called him the President of the Confederate States of America.  Plus, the Whig Party joined the anti-Catholic Know-Nothings in its last days, so....  (The original Democratic platform said the federal government couldn't interfere with ""domestic institutions"" of the States--meaning slavery--same as the Confederate Constitution, but I think that's more pro-decentralization than pro-slavery: that doesn't mean the STATES cannot.)P. P. P. S.  I should have posted this in the first place: what is the significance of the title ""The Birth of a Nation"" for a movie about the War Between the States and Reconstruction?  Clearly they're not talking about the United States of America per se, as that was born out of the War of Independence.  But there was disunity from even before independence (indeed, the film claims that the seeds of disunity were sown by bringing Africans here), and the Confederate States were forced back into the Union as a result of the war, so that's probably part of it, as the movie is clearly pro-unity.  However, in keeping with what I've said above, I would hold that, at least to Mr. Griffith's mind, he was also thinking in a way that we usually don't anymore, but which used to be taken for granted with regard to nations.  A nation, properly speaking, is an ethnic group of people, often who live in a particular place and rule a particular state.  The ""nation"" being referred to here is also a people, that being white Americans, Americans descended from settlers from the British Isles and elsewhere in Europe.  So the movie ending with the Klan having in practice (if not in law) regained sovereignty in the South, and rescued Austin Stoneman's daughter from a forced marriage, and Union veterans protecting the Cameron family, is also about the unity of white Americans after the disunity that led to the war, not just unity of the United States as an entity divorced from its people (which again is a new idea).  It's hard to look at it now, but let's bear in mind that it could have been worse: the Klan at the end does nothing worse than keep black men from the polls, they do not physically harm them as the 20th-century Klan probably would have.",4,"Four stars for what it was trying to be, one star marked off for what it was",1372982400,"07 5, 2013",2013,17335,"['Let', 'try', 'put', 'emotion', 'aside',

396419,A1EB3EO0NZ1LO,630401967X,The Movie Critic,"[45, 51]","Few films have been able to spawn the amount of controversy that D W Griffith's silent epic has. `The Birth of a Nation' continues to enrage its viewers and has the dubious honour of being one of the most despised films ever made.Every serious film buff eventually comes across `The Birth of a Nation', and the feelings that it creates are often mixed. It is the sort of film that is generally watched only by critics, film historians and those who are interested in the artistic and technical sides of cinema. These days, some people may have heard of the film, but very few have seen it. The thought of a silent film from 1915 that runs for a touch over three hours would put the majority off in an instant.The film covers the Civil war, the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, the reconstruction of the South and the rise of the Ku Klux Klan. D W Griffith astounded audiences with the introduction of many new filmmaking techniques that laid the groundwork for the future of cinema. Without exaggerating, practically every film made afterward must give some credit to `The Birth of a Nation'. The film is constructed and put together seamlessly and still looks amazingly fresh. It was once regarded as one of the 10 greatest films ever made, but the repercussions of the film have marred it's status. So much so that when the American Film Institute put together a list of the 100 greatest films, `The Birth of a Nation' was placed at number 44.After its release, there were many that wanted the film banned because of the subject matter it featured. The film was accused of rewriting American history as part of the story shows the African Americans threatening to create a black empire and dominate the South, all with the support of Northern carpetbaggers. The threat is countered by the rise of the Ku Klux Klan who are credited as being the saviours of the South and bringing about political control and peace. So a major complaint was that the film was grossly inaccurate from a historical viewpoint, though there were claims by historians that argued for its authenticity.But the main factor that caused outrage was the way that the African Americans were presented. It was a different world in 1915 though, and the film is a reflection of its time, seeing as how those views and attitudes were what many white people would have had and grew up with. Griffith no doubt would have had prejudice embedded in him from his childhood, or at least a superior attitude towards Negroes. But Griffith insisted he was not hateful toward African Americans and Lillian Gish herself backed up that claim.The film has also been put in the same category as Nazi propaganda. That of course was not Griffith's intent, though the Ku Klux Klan have used this film to support their cause. These days, audiences are disturbed at seeing the Ku Klux Klan in a glorified manner. But the Klan that Griffith depicts was inspired by the original Klan that began in the 1860's and which had gone out of existence by 1915. They were not as hateful and evil as they were in more recent times. Although you can't condone the things they did when first formed, from a white supremacist's point of view, they would have been considered heroic.For all the outrage and consequences the film brought on, Griffith never meant to offend anyone. And it's reasonable to conclude that if there were historical inaccuracies, Griffith either thought that what he was showing was accurate or he may have been creating parts of the story for dramatic effect. Maybe it was both. No director would knowingly make a film that would cause the amount of trouble that this did. Griffith always stated that his intentions were good and was forever apologetic about the film.Opinions of the film will always be divided. It is very difficult for some to praise the film, but to look at it as objectively as possible, its hard not to be impressed. `The Birth of a Nation' is still so modern, so incredibly fluent and coherent. Griffith truly understood cinema and how movies really worked. He was a director who was light-years ahead of his time and has no doubt inspired countless others. How many other films can claim to have contributed so much to cinema?",5,The Birth of Cinema,1124755200,"08 23, 2005",2005,4212,"['Few', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'spawn', 'amount', 'controversy', 'D', 'W', 'Griffith', 'silent', 'epic', 'Birth', 'Nation', 'enrage', 'viewers', 'dubious', 'honour', 'being', 'one', 'most', 'despised', 'films', 'ever', 'made.Every', 'serious', 'film', 'buff', 'eventually', 'Birth', 'Nation', 'feelings', 'are', 'often', 'mixed', 'sort', 'film', 'generally', 'watched', 'only', 'critics', 'film', 'historians', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'artistic', 'technical', 'sides', 'cinema', 'days', 'people', 'may', 'have', 'heard', 'film', 'very', 'few', 'have', 'seen', 'thought', 'silent', 'film', '1915', 'touch', 'three', 'hours', 'would', 'put', 'majority', 'off', 'instant.The', 'film', 'Civil', 'war', 'assassination', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'reconstruction', 'South', 'rise', 'Ku', 'Klux', 'Klan', 'D', 'W', 'Griffith', 'astounded', 'audiences', 'introduction', 'many', 'new', 'filmmaking', 'techniques', 'laid', 'groundwork', 'future', 'cinema', 'exaggerating', 'practically', 'film', 'made', 'afterward', 'must', 'give', 'credit', 'Birth', 'Nation', 'film', 'constructed', 'put', 'together', 'seamlessly', 'still', 'amazingly', 'fresh', 'was', 'once', 'regarded', 'one', '10', 'greatest', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'repercussions', 'film', 'have', 'marred', 'status', 'So', 'much', 'when', 'American', 'Film', 'Institute', 'put', 'together', 'list', '100', 'greatest', 'films', 'Birth', 'Nation', 'was', 'placed', 'number', '44.After', 'release', 'were', 'many', 'wanted', 'film', 'banned', 'subject', 'matter', 'featured', 'film', 'was', 'accused', 'rewriting', 'American', 'history', 'part', 'story', 'African', 'Americans', 'threatening', 'create', 'black', 'empire', 'dominate', 'South', 'support', 'Northern', 'carpetbaggers', 'threat', 'countered', 'rise', 'Ku', 'Klux', 'Klan', 'who', 'are', 'credited', 'being', 'saviours', 'South', 'bringing', 'about', 'political', 'control', 'peace', 'major', 'complaint', 'was', 'film', 'was', 'grossly', 'inaccurate', 'historical', 'viewpoint', 'were', 'claims', 'historians', 'argued', 'authenticity.But', 'main', 'factor', 'caused', 'outrage', 'was', 'way', 'African', 'Americans', 'were', 'presented', 'was', 'different', 'world', '1915', 'film', 'reflection', 'time', 'seeing', 'how', 'views', 'attitudes', 'were', 'what', 'many', 'white', 'people', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'grew', 'up', 'Griffith', 'doubt', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'prejudice', 'embedded', 'childhood', 'least', 'superior', 'attitude', 'towards', 'Negroes', 'Griffith', 'insisted', 'was', 'not', 'hateful', 'African', 'Americans', 'Lillian', 'Gish', 'backed', 'up', 'claim.The', 'film', 'also', 'been', 'put', 'same', 'category', 'Nazi', 'propaganda', 'course', 'was', 'not', 'Griffith', 'intent', 'Ku', 'Klux', 'Klan', 'have', 'used', 'film', 'support', 'cause', 'days', 'audiences', 'are', 'disturbed', 'seeing', 'Ku', 'Klux', 'Klan', 'glorified', 'manner', 'Klan', 'Griffith', 'depicts', 'was', 'inspired', 'original', 'Klan', 'began', '1860', 'had', 'gone', 'existence', '1915', 'were', 'not', 'hateful', 'evil', 'were', 'more', 'recent', 'times', 'ca', ""n't"", 'condone', 'things', 'did', 'when', 'first', 'formed', 'white', 'supremacist', 'point', 'view', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'considered', 'heroic.For', 'outrage', 'film', 'brought', 'Griffith', 'never', 'meant', 'offend', 'anyone', 'reasonable', 'conclude', 'were', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'Griffith', 'thought', 'what', 'was', 'showing', 'was', 'accurate', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'creating', 'parts', 'story', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'Maybe', 'was', 'director', 'would', 'knowingly', 'make', 'film', 'would', 'cause', 'amount', 'trouble', 'did', 'Griffith', 'always', 'stated', 'intentions', 'were', 'good', 'was', 'forever', 'apologetic', 'film.Opinions', 'film', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'divided', 'very', 'difficult', 'praise', 'film', 'look', 'as', 'objectively', 'possible', 'hard', 'not', 'be', 'impressed', 'Birth', 'Nation', 'still', 'so', 'modern', 'so', 'incredibly', 'fluent', 'coherent', 'Griffith', 'truly', 'understood', 'cinema', 'how', 'movies', 'really', 'worked', 'was', 'director', 'who', 'was', 'light-years', 'ahead', 'time', 'doubt', 'inspired', 'countless', 'others', 'How', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'can', 'claim', 'have', 'contributed', 'so', 'much', 'cinema']",N/A

But there's a good case that it may have been the first ""blockbuster"" film event. After _Birth of a Nation_, American films became more elaborate, more spectacular and more costly. That rough-hewn American emphasis on large-scale epic grandeur persisted up to the era of sound (a mere thirteen years), when new technology made such spectacles temporarily unfeasible.The film itself offers a race-baiting vision of Reconstruction, as interpreted by the now-discredited Dunning School. Woodrow Wilson, another historian in that movement, praised the film for ""authenticity,"" but contemporary historians know that it's all a load of bunk. The real surprise, for people who are familiar with the horrifying, bottomless race hatred of that period, is that Griffith is far more sympathetic to Black Americans than his sources are -- which says quite a lot about his sources. (For another major American film that reiterates the Dunning School party line, albeit in a more moderate form, see _Gone With the Wind_. Or don't.)Video restoration guru David Shepard has done an excellent job in restoring this landmark film (using a 1921 print that cites Wilson's praise), and even includes a half-hour documentary on the making of the film. The score is of recent vintage, but it is well-performed and fits the action.The recent 2-disc release by Kino Video also features several early Biograph films from Griffith, all of them pertaining to the Civil War.
