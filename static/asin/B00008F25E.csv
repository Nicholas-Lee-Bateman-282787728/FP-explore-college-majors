A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[6, 9]","Some movies don't make sense.Exhibit A: ""Deception,"" a thriller full of money, deception and baseball cards, which started off on a promising note, but rapidly became too absurd to really deal with. The only saving grace is Liam Neeson, but even his charm cannot keep ""Deception"" honest.Young mother Bessie Faro (Andie MacDowell) is shattered when she learns that her husband Johnny (Viggo Mortensen) was in a fatal plane crash. Even worse, their joint plane company is about bankrupt. But when she goes to Mexico to identify the body, she finds that her husband has been making massive deposits in banks all over the world. The key to finding them: Johnny's baseball cards.At first, Bessie is overjoyed at picking up the vast sums of money, since she can easily support herself and her young children with it for many years. But then she learns that the accounts are being closed -- is her husband still alive? The search brings her on a parallel path to a kindly humanitarian, Dr. Lamb (Liam Neeson).... and to the ugly truth about where her husband got all that money.Buried inside ""Deception"" is a pair of movies. Not one, but two. One is about a rather dim housewife discovering her husband's Big Secret. The other is about gunrunners, embezzlement and murder. Unfortunately, this movie is mashed together into a logic-free, tedious mess.Despite the international travels, there isn't much scenery in this movie, except some dusty streets and one pretty shot of Lamb and Bessie smooching atop the pyramid (are people allowed to climb those anymore?). Even more time is devoted to the baseball card trick, which seems too weird to be possible, and then to the even more improbable gunrunning scenario.Mortensen does a passable job as Johnny Faro, but he's frankly in too little of the movie to really register. And what little time he has is spent in sneering and leering. MacDowell is passable at best, embarrassing at worst (crying into the freezer?). She's completely outshone by Neeson, who lends surprisingly pathos and warmth as a humanitarian who finds out his charity is funded by gunrunners.The only redeeming factor is Neeson. Aside from him, ""Deception"" is doomed to fail by a pair of improbable plots, and a dimwitted housewife played by a famous model.

741551,A1X4JO8EJ1U5BR,B00008F25E,"Mike London ""MAC""","[3, 5]","DECEPTION really is a mess of a movie.  This is the type of film you would watch on the Lifetime Channel on a Saturday afternoon - overwrought drama, rather bad acting, unconvincing (or, in DECEPTION's case, improbable) storylines, and self-conscious, let's make a statement about the ills of society and what we can do to fix them kind of script writing.  It's a bad movie.The story revolves around a surburban wife, after her husband staged his own death, discovering that her husband had a lot of dark secrets in his life involving gambling, baseball cards, and secret bank accounts.  The storyline tries to combine two totally different plotlines - the effect of the wife discovering her husband's dark secret, and then what the husband did to get all the money.The only real redeeming factor is Liam Neeson.  Even Viggo Mortenson, ala Aragorn, doesn't do much here.  He hangs around looking menancing.  Andie MacDowell, famous model, has about as much acting talent as one would expect from the model (ala none), and brings very little to the table on an already weak and improbably storyline.Apparently, the film was released as RUBY CAIRO internationally, but as DECEPTION in the US.  According to a review on Amazon, they cut 20 minutes, including a sex scene.  The cut material may or may not add to the film (I haven't seen it).  Probably does.Then again, the material they left in is so subpar why waste another twenty minutes of your life on this trash?",2,Screenwriter must be a fan of Lifetime Telivision,1193875200,"11 1, 2007",2007,1465,"['DECEPTION', 'really', 'mess', 'movie', 'type', 'film', 'would', 'watch', 'Lifetime', 'Channel', 'Saturday', 'afternoon', 'overwrought', 'drama', 'rather', 'bad', 'acting', 'unconvincing', 'DECEPTION', 'case', 'improbable', 'storylines', 'self-conscious', 'let', 'make', 'statement', 'ills', 'society', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'fix', 'kind', 'script', 'writing', 'bad', 'movie.The', 'story', 'around', 'surburban', 'wife', 'husband', 'staged', 'own', 'death', 'discovering', 'husband', 'had', 'lot', 'dark', 'secrets', 'life', 'involving', 'gambling', 'baseball', 'cards', 'secret', 'bank', 'accounts', 'storyline', 'tries', 'combine', 'two', 'totally', 'different', 'plotlines', 'effect', 'wife', 'discovering', 'husband', 'dark', 'secret', 'then', 'what', 'husband', 'did', 'get', 'money.The', 'only', 'real', 'redeeming', 'factor', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Even', 'Viggo', 'Mortenson', 'ala', 'Aragorn', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'here', 'looking', 'menancing', 'Andie', 'MacDowell', 'famous', 'model', 'about', 'as', 'much', 'acting', 'talent', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'model', 'none', 'very', 'little', 'table', 'already', 'weak', 'improbably', 'storyline.Apparently', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'RUBY', 'CAIRO', 'internationally', 'DECEPTION', 'US', 'According', 'review', 'Amazon', 'cut', '20', 'minutes', 'including', 'sex', 'scene', 'cut', 'material', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'add', 'film', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Probably', 'does.Then', 'again', 'material', 'left', 'so', 'subpar', 'why', 'waste', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'life', 'trash']",N/A

Sadly, the films the Japanese got involved with were things like Last Action Hero, Solar Crisis and this.....Ruby Cairo. Too bad they lost their shirts.Ruby Cairo, however, deserves a lot more praise than the aforementioned.Andie MacDowell stars as a housewife with three kids living out in suburbia near the airport. Her seemingly no good husband,played by  Viggo Mortenson in one of his very early roles, runs his own airplane salvage company and spends months away from home.When her husband burns up in a crash in Mexico his remains are delivered to MacDowell and she goes across the border to bury him.Upon her arrival she finds that her husband had a secret office, some very unsavory business partners and a set of baseball cards that lead his distraught wife all over the world to try and find out just what her husband was up to. Along the way she runs into Liam Neeson who may or may not be connected to her dead husbands evil deeds.The movie is named Ruby Cairo in various other parts of the world but was labled Deception in the U.S. I have no idea if it every made it to the theaters in America but it had quite a good run on cable tv for a number of years which made it somewhat of a minor cult movie.The movie itself is not an award winner but there is something about the story that keeps the viewer entertained. Andie Macdowell does a good job playing the naieve housewife who slowly realizes she has been made a fool of. Mortenson's part is sadly way to short and perhaps the back story of his wheeling and dealing might have enhanced the film a bit.The soundtrack should also be noted as a rare one by Oscar Winner John Barry, which, as always, boosts this simple film and gives it the emotion it deserves.This movie is a simple, rainy afternoon, mystery/suspense drama. Its well made, the locations are exotic and the photography and the music well done.Once you find out the twist at the end, you may not watch it again...however you just might join the ranks of those who still like it no matter how many times they watch.",4,"A good rainy afternoon, suspense drama that is worthy of praise.",1147824000,"05 17, 2006",2006,2152,"['Back', 'late', '80', 'early', '90', 'few', 'Japanese', 'producers', 'were', 'keen', 'break', 'mainstream', 'hollywood', 'Sadly', 'films', 'Japanese', 'got', 'involved', 'were', 'things', 'Last', 'Action', 'Hero', 'Solar', 'Crisis', '..Ruby', 'Cairo', 'Too', 'bad', 'lost', 'shirts.Ruby', 'Cairo', 'however', 'lot', 'more', 'praise', 'aforementioned.Andie', 'MacDowell', 'housewife', 'three', 'kids', 'living', 'out', 'suburbia', 'airport', 'seemingly', 'good', 'husband', 'played', 'Viggo', 'Mortenson', 'one', 'very', 'early', 'roles', 'own', 'airplane', 'salvage', 'company', 'spends', 'months', 'away', 'husband', 'up', 'crash', 'Mexico', 'remains', 'are', 'delivered', 'MacDowell', 'border', 'bury', 'him.Upon', 'arrival', 'husband', 'had', 'secret', 'office', 'very', 'unsavory', 'business', 'partners', 'set', 'baseball', 'cards', 'lead', 'distraught', 'wife', 'world', 'try', 'find', 'out', 'just', 'what', 'husband', 'was', 'up', 'way', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'connected', 'dead', 'husbands', 'evil', 'deeds.The', 'movie', 'named', 'Ruby', 'Cairo', 'various', 'other', 'parts', 'world', 'was', 'labled', 'Deception', 'U.S', 'have', 'idea', 'made', 'theaters', 'America', 'had', 'quite', 'good', 'run', 'cable', 'tv', 'number', 'years', 'made', 'somewhat', 'minor', 'cult', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'not', 'award', 'winner', 'something', 'story', 'viewer', 'entertained', 'Andie', 'Macdowell', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'naieve', 'housewife', 'who', 'slowly', 'been', 'made', 'fool', 'Mortenson', 'part', 'sadly', 'way', 'short', 'perhaps', 'back', 'story', 'wheeling', 'dealing', 'might', 'have', 'enhanced', 'film', 'bit.The', 'soundtrack', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'noted', 'rare', 'one', 'Oscar', 'Winner', 'John', 'Barry', 'always', 'simple', 'film', 'emotion', 'deserves.This', 'movie', 'simple', 'rainy', 'afternoon', 'mystery/suspense', 'drama', 'well', 'made', 'locations', 'are', 'exotic', 'photography', 'music', 'well', 'done.Once', 'find', 'out', 'twist', 'end', 'may', 'not', 'watch', 'again', 'however', 'just', 'might', 'join', 'ranks', 'who', 'still', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'watch']",N/A

She identifies the body, finds a stash of baseball cards that belongs to him hidden under a desk, and unscrambles the fact that he has hidden money all over the world in various banks.She travels the globe and empties the bank accounts. From a poor, widowed mother of three, she suddenly finds over $800,000 in cash.When she starts to suspect that her husband is still alive, the story takes a turn nowhere. The only conclusion I've come up with is that the writers thought the audience could fill in the blanks. If you want to know why, he did it, forget it.  SPOILER: If you want to know why he gets murdered at the end, forget it. If you want to know why his personality has taken a 180 degree change from the charming husband, forget it. If you want to know if he has any remorse leaving behind three children and a wife penniless that he has spent years with, forget it.
