But I was way too old when Pokemon first came out (1998, I think?), and I'm definitely way too old now. But I can't help myself from buying these DVDs whenever they are released in the US. And it's not like the stories are any good, and I haven't played the games in years. But something about them makes me buy them every time they come out. Maybe it's because I already have them all and I just want to keep the collection going. It certainly can't be the story line. ""Pokemon is distressed. Ash saves the world. Pika pika!"" But as the Pokemon keep getting more and more ridiculous and more powerful and uglier, the characters keep getting more blah. I know this is a children's movie, but still, there can be a better storyline.By the way, anyone know when the next one comes out?",2,Why do I keep buying these?,1291420800,"12 4, 2010",2010,842,"['love', 'Pokemon', 'have', 'single', 'movie', 'released', 'DVD', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'old', 'when', 'Pokemon', 'first', 'came', 'out', '1998', 'think', ""'m"", 'definitely', 'way', 'too', 'old', 'now', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'buying', 'DVDs', 'whenever', 'are', 'released', 'US', 'not', 'stories', 'are', 'good', 'have', ""n't"", 'played', 'games', 'years', 'something', 'buy', 'time', 'come', 'out', 'Maybe', 'already', 'have', 'just', 'want', 'keep', 'collection', 'going', 'certainly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'story', 'line', 'Pokemon', 'distressed', 'Ash', 'world', 'Pika', 'pika', 'Pokemon', 'keep', 'getting', 'more', 'more', 'ridiculous', 'more', 'powerful', 'uglier', 'characters', 'keep', 'getting', 'more', 'blah', 'know', 'children', 'movie', 'still', 'can', 'be', 'better', 'storyline.By', 'way', 'anyone', 'know', 'when', 'next', 'one', 'out']",Pokemon: Giratina and The Sky Warrior
1232263,ARNEUO7BF3J55,B001QWQJ9W,E. David Swan,"[0, 0]","`Giratina and the Sky Warrior' starts with an explosive bang. A Shaymin (tiny flowered hedgehog looking Pokemon) is delicately lapping water from a small lake when who should wander along but the titanic time controlling Pokemon, Dialga, to quench his own massive thirst. The idyllic scene is shattered by the appearance of Giratina who tears open a dimensional portal and drags Dialga down it into the Distortion World. In the ensuing whirlwind the diminutive Shaymin is inadvertently yanked along. What follows is a knock down drag out battle between Giratina and Dialga that is jaw dropping in scope. This is the first time a Pokemon movie has ever really wowed me. Poor Shaymin is buffeted around in the maelstrom while the battle is being observed by several interested parties. Finally, the panicking Shaymin shows that he too is no slouch by opening a dimensional rift allowing himself and Dialga to escape while locking Giratina behind. The animation in the opening sequence is light years ahead of what was seen in the early Pokemon movies and this was the moment for me when the series went past appealing to just Pokemon fans and arrived as a truly superior piece of animation.Following the huge opening the film naturally relaxes and moves to Ash, Dawn and Brock who are, as always, traveling the countryside. During a picnic they come across the dirty but still mischievous Shaymin and discover that when cleaned up he not only literally blooms like a small flower patch but is also capable of speaking telepathically. The downside is that he's a bit of a snot although he eventually calms down as he gets used to Ash and friends. The general plot of the movie is that a fellow named Zero is looking to protect the Distortion World at the expense of the real world but to do this he needs to be able to travel back and forth between the two worlds and to do this he needs to capture Giratina and steal his powers. If I had one problem with this movie it's that the ending closely mirrors the ending of every single Pokemon movie ever made with the power of heart triumphing over evil. Of course this clich&eacute; is used in about half the anime out there.As I stated earlier this movie transcends being just another Pokemon movie installment. This is a high quality animation with spectacular visuals and music and it just happens to feature Pokemon. The Pokemon license is essentially a license to print money but rather than coast along the producers are clearly in this for the long haul and consistently try to outdo the previous effort. The Diamond/Pearl trilogy is thus far the highlight of the Pokemon movie series but having seen the preview for the upcoming Phantom Ruler: Zoroark it looks as if OLM Incorporated is looking to once again raise the bar. This is the rare Pokemon movie that an adult can watch and not feel embarrassed. As the best of the Pokemon movies I'll give it the full five stars.",5,The Best Pokemon Movie Yet,1274918400,"05 27, 2010",2010,2924,"['Giratina', 'Sky', 'Warrior', 'starts', 'explosive', 'bang', 'Shaymin', 'tiny', 'flowered', 'hedgehog', 'looking', 'Pokemon', 'delicately', 'lapping', 'water', 'small', 'lake', 'when', 'who', 'should', 'wander', 'titanic', 'time', 'controlling', 'Pokemon', 'Dialga', 'quench', 'own', 'massive', 'thirst', 'idyllic', 'scene', 'shattered', 'appearance', 'Giratina', 'who', 'open', 'dimensional', 'portal', 'drags', 'Dialga', 'Distortion', 'World', 'ensuing', 'diminutive', 'Shaymin', 'inadvertently', 'yanked', 'along', 'What', 'knock', 'down', 'drag', 'out', 'battle', 'Giratina', 'Dialga', 'jaw', 'dropping', 'scope', 'first', 'time', 'Pokemon', 'movie', 'ever', 'really', 'wowed', 'Poor', 'Shaymin', 'buffeted', 'maelstrom', 'battle', 'being', 'observed', 'several', 'interested', 'parties', 'Finally', 'panicking', 'Shaymin', 'too', 'slouch', 'opening', 'dimensional', 'rift', 'allowing', 'Dialga', 'escape', 'locking', 'Giratina', 'behind', 'animation', 'opening', 'sequence', 'light', 'years', 'ahead', 'what', 'was', 'seen', 'early', 'Pokemon', 'movies', 'was', 'moment', 'when', 'series', 'went', 'past', 'appealing', 'just', 'Pokemon', 'fans', 'arrived', 'truly', 'superior', 'piece', 'animation.Following', 'huge', 'opening', 'film', 'naturally', 'relaxes', 'moves', 'Ash', 'Dawn', 'Brock', 'who', 'are', 'always', 'traveling', 'countryside', 'picnic', 'come', 'dirty', 'still', 'mischievous', 'Shaymin', 'discover', 'when', 'cleaned', 'up', 'not', 'only', 'literally', 'blooms', 'small', 'flower', 'patch', 'also', 'capable', 'speaking', 'telepathically', 'downside', 'bit', 'snot', 'eventually', 'calms', 'down', 'used', 'Ash', 'friends', 'general', 'plot', 'movie', 'fellow', 'named', 'Zero', 'looking', 'protect', 'Distortion', 'World', 'expense', 'real', 'world', 'do', 'be', 'able', 'travel', 'back', 'forth', 'two', 'worlds', 'do', 'capture', 'Giratina', 'steal', 'powers', 'had', 'one', 'problem', 'movie', 'ending', 'closely', 'ending', 'single', 'Pokemon', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'power', 'heart', 'triumphing', 'evil', 'course', 'clich', 'eacute', 'used', 'about', 'anime', 'there.As', 'stated', 'earlier', 'movie', 'being', 'just', 'Pokemon', 'movie', 'installment', 'high', 'quality', 'animation', 'spectacular', 'visuals', 'music', 'just', 'feature', 'Pokemon', 'Pokemon', 'license', 'essentially', 'license', 'print', 'money', 'rather', 'coast', 'producers', 'are', 'clearly', 'long', 'haul', 'consistently', 'try', 'outdo', 'previous', 'effort', 'Diamond/Pearl', 'trilogy', 'thus', 'far', 'highlight', 'Pokemon', 'movie', 'series', 'having', 'seen', 'preview', 'upcoming', 'Phantom', 'Ruler', 'Zoroark', 'OLM', 'Incorporated', 'looking', 'once', 'again', 'raise', 'bar', 'rare', 'Pokemon', 'movie', 'adult', 'can', 'watch', 'not', 'feel', 'embarrassed', 'best', 'Pokemon', 'movies', ""'ll"", 'give', 'full', 'five', 'stars']",Pokemon: Giratina and The Sky Warrior

1232265,A2SH7OWE8QJYNC,B001QWQJ9W,Kaleidocherry,"[1, 9]","Wow, was this movie confusing.  I realize it's a big commercial for the new Pokemon Platinum game coming out next month, but there were some big weirdnesses in it.  As usual, there is a new character having an adventure and Ash horns in on it and takes all the action, glory and credit.  Never was this more painfully obvious than in ""Pokemon 4Ever,"" where a boy named Sam has a time-traveling adventure with Celebi, but as soon as he comes to Ash's time, Ash starts hogging the whole show.  But in ""Giratina"" it is almost as bad.The middle of the movie is pretty much standard fare, with the telepathically-speaking Shaymin (an annoying little whiner) providing sappy commentary.  The players move in and out of the Distortion World, and although this appears to be a frightening alternate world, they (of course) all travel through it with aplomb.(As a side note I notice that the main Pokemon in the last 4 movies have all been able to speak telepathically - Shaymin, Darkrai, Manaphy and Lucario.  I wonder whether this is just a tactic for the movies, being done because kids are bored hearing Pokemon only speak their own names, or is it a new feature of the Pokemon canon that may be released in a new game, i.e., Professor Oak (or whoever) will have invented something that lets us ""hear"" Poke-speech?  But I digress.)Later, when the baddie is trying to destroy Giratina, all of a sudden a Regigigas wakes up from some kind of enchanted sleep and walks out to where the main characters are (except Ash, who is off being heroic with Pikachu in the Distortion World).  As Regigigas appears to try and hold back a moving waterfall that threatens to freeze the entire area, hordes of Mamoswine appear and assist Regigigas.  Nobody says anything at this point except Dawn, who says, ""Look at all the Mamoswine!""  They stand there watching the Regigigas and Mamoswine trying to hold the frozen glacier-thing in place, and then, when the disaster has been averted, Regigigas and the Mamoswine simply walk away.  No explanation is provided for why Regigigas woke from his strange temple and tried to hold back the glacier, or why the Mamoswine felt compelled to help it; no explanation is given as to why they all walked away (or where they went) after the disaster was dealt with.  Truly a cheap deus ex machina tactic.For those of you Team Rocket fans, you may be wondering what their role is in all this.  As far as I can tell, early on, they got sucked into the Distortion World.  Periodically while Ash and Co. were monkeying around in there, we'd see Team Rocket in trouble.  Towards the end, we see them trying to escape the Distortion World and failing.  I don't even remember if the Team Rocket situation was resolved.  Other than Meowth cracking a few jokes, and a lot of footage of them screaming in fear in the Distortion World, there was not really any Team Rocket to speak of.The animation in Pokemon movies seems to be getting better over time, especially with non-moving things like buildings.  I might almost say that the buildings in the movie are on a par with Studio Ghibli stuff.  But the landscaping and the characters are still drawn in the very cheap way that the early Pokemon TV shows were done.All in all I was quite disappointed - even my 8YO son found some of this to be bizarre - and we probably won't get the DVD.",2,Subpar story with some good animation,1235347200,"02 23, 2009",2009,3344,"['Wow', 'was', 'movie', 'confusing', 'realize', 'big', 'commercial', 'new', 'Pokemon', 'Platinum', 'game', 'coming', 'out', 'next', 'month', 'were', 'big', 'weirdnesses', 'usual', 'new', 'character', 'having', 'adventure', 'Ash', 'horns', 'action', 'glory', 'credit', 'was', 'more', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'Pokemon', '4Ever', 'where', 'boy', 'named', 'Sam', 'time-traveling', 'adventure', 'Celebi', 'as', 'soon', 'Ash', 'time', 'Ash', 'hogging', 'whole', 'show', 'Giratina', 'almost', 'bad.The', 'middle', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'standard', 'fare', 'telepathically-speaking', 'Shaymin', 'annoying', 'little', 'whiner', 'providing', 'sappy', 'commentary', 'players', 'move', 'Distortion', 'World', 'be', 'frightening', 'alternate', 'world', 'course', 'travel', 'aplomb', 'side', 'note', 'notice', 'main', 'Pokemon', 'last', '4', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'speak', 'telepathically', 'Shaymin', 'Darkrai', 'Manaphy', 'Lucario', 'wonder', 'just', 'tactic', 'movies', 'being', 'done', 'kids', 'are', 'bored', 'hearing', 'Pokemon', 'only', 'speak', 'own', 'names', 'new', 'feature', 'Pokemon', 'canon', 'may', 'be', 'released', 'new', 'game', 'i.e.', 'Professor', 'Oak', 'whoever', 'will', 'have', 'invented', 'something', 'hear', 'Poke-speech', 'digress', 'Later', 'when', 'baddie', 'trying', 'destroy', 'Giratina', 'sudden', 'Regigigas', 'up', 'kind', 'enchanted', 'sleep', 'out', 'where', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'Ash', 'who', 'being', 'heroic', 'Pikachu', 'Distortion', 'World', 'Regigigas', 'try', 'hold', 'back', 'moving', 'waterfall', 'freeze', 'entire', 'area', 'hordes', 'Mamoswine', 'appear', 'assist', 'Regigigas', 'Nobody', 'anything', 'point', 'Dawn', 'who', 'Look', 'Mamoswine', 'stand', 'there', 'watching', 'Regigigas', 'Mamoswine', 'trying', 'hold', 'frozen', 'glacier-thing', 'place', 'then', 'when', 'disaster', 'been', 'averted', 'Regigigas', 'Mamoswine', 'simply', 'walk', 'away', 'explanation', 'provided', 'why', 'Regigigas', 'woke', 'strange', 'temple', 'tried', 'hold', 'back', 'glacier', 'why', 'Mamoswine', 'felt', 'compelled', 'help', 'explanation', 'given', 'why', 'walked', 'away', 'where', 'went', 'disaster', 'was', 'dealt', 'Truly', 'cheap', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'tactic.For', 'Team', 'Rocket', 'fans', 'may', 'be', 'wondering', 'what', 'role', 'As', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'early', 'got', 'sucked', 'Distortion', 'World', 'Periodically', 'Ash', 'Co.', 'were', 'monkeying', 'around', 'there', ""'d"", 'see', 'Team', 'Rocket', 'trouble', 'end', 'see', 'trying', 'escape', 'Distortion', 'World', 'failing', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'remember', 'Team', 'Rocket', 'situation', 'was', 'resolved', 'Other', 'Meowth', 'cracking', 'few', 'jokes', 'lot', 'footage', 'screaming', 'fear', 'Distortion', 'World', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'Team', 'Rocket', 'speak', 'of.The', 'animation', 'Pokemon', 'movies', 'be', 'getting', 'better', 'time', 'especially', 'non-moving', 'things', 'buildings', 'might', 'almost', 'say', 'buildings', 'movie', 'are', 'par', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'stuff', 'landscaping', 'characters', 'are', 'still', 'drawn', 'very', 'cheap', 'way', 'early', 'Pokemon', 'TV', 'shows', 'were', 'done.All', 'was', 'quite', 'disappointed', 'even', '8YO', 'son', 'found', 'be', 'bizarre', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'DVD']",Pokemon: Giratina and The Sky Warrior

1232268,A1EEG7YJIYN60B,B001QWQJ9W,Lesley Aeschliman,"[0, 1]","Pokemon: Giratina and the Sky Warrior is the eleventh film in the Pokemon franchise, and was directed by Kunihiko Yuyama.  This DVD was released on March 31, 2009, and it is the first Pokemon film to be distributed by Universal in the United States.In this film, we meet the Legendary Pokemon Shaymin and Giratina, and Dialga makes a second appearance in a Pokemon film (with its first appearance being The Rise of Darkrai).Like The Rise of Darkrai, Giratina and the Sky Warrior was released as a single disc.  On the disc, you can watch the film, use the setup menu to choose whether you want to have English subtitles as well as which English audio option you want, and you can choose where in the film you want to start watching.  When it comes to the subtitles, this disc includes a way to turn them off in the menu if your player decides to default to showing the English subtitles.Another similarity this release shares with The Rise of Darkrai is the fact that there are no special features included on the disc.  The cost of this DVD has been priced to run the same amount as a DVD release that includes bonus features.
