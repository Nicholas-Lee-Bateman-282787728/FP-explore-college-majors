Many people have condemned this film as being anti lesbian, but I feel it is a study in abusive behavior and the insecurities that feed it. It's also very  campy and a hoot. Susannah York as Childie  and Coral Browne ( Vera Charles in Auntie Mame) also give very brave and wonderful performances considering this movie was made in the sixties. The story is of a lechorous lesbian who plays a nun on a British Soap Opera.On screen she is kindly and a total humanitarian; offstage is something else altogeher. George is an alcholic lesbian who abuses her younger lover and comes on to real nuns in their taxi cabs. When the BBC threatens to write her out of the soap opera due to her scandalous off-screen behavior, a paranoid lesbian becomes even more abusive.

547527,A3GRN6J64F2C3X,B00004KHDT,"Joseph P. Menta, Jr.","[7, 18]","It's my own fault, I guess.  I knew there was a provocative angle to ""The Killing of Sister George,"" but because of the title I thought that in addition to the naughty stuff we'd be getting a murder mystery of some kind.  So it all sounded good... a little mystery, a little sex, what more can one ask?  Alas, there's no murder mystery: the title refers to Beryl Reid's actress character worrying about whether or not the ""Sister George"" character she plays on a TV drama is going to be killed off.  Okay, but there was still the provocative stuff to save the day, right?  Well, here things are sort of problematic, too.  Anyway, here's the good and bad about this strange little drama.GOOD:  The movie only seems endless.  It's actually a good bit shorter than the three hours it feels like (it clocks in at a shade under 2 hours and 20 minutes).  That means that if you start the movie now, in three hours you can say to yourself, ""Thank God, I'm already 40 minutes past the ordeal of that movie.""BAD:  Beryl Reid's over-the-hill actress character is reprehensible and grating.  This doesn't have anything to do with the fact that she's a lesbian.  It does have to do with the fact that she's abusive, whiny, and shrill.  Uggh.GOOD:  Susannah York's character is likable, pretty, and interesting.BAD:  Susannah York's character is the only female character in this movie who is likable, pretty, and interesting.  A quick aside on this topic: I swear, I'm sure that lesbian women don't like to be uniformally portrayed in the media as sultry model types, but I can't believe that they appreciate being uniformly portrayed in the opposite extreme, as they are here.  For example, with the exception of maybe (maybe!) one or two quick walk-ons in the scene set in the lesbian bar, every woman in that long bar scene looks like a man.  There's no other way to put it.  Sorry, guys... no ""The L Word"" here.GOOD:  It's nice that the moralism is kept to a minimum and there was no need on the part of the film makers to have any of the lesbian characters commit suicide or meet some other type of major tragedy.  Beryl Reid's character doesn't turn out too well in the end, but that's only because she's a creep, not a lesbian.BAD:  The movie betrays its roots on the stage, with several long, talky, stage-bound sequences.  That sort of stuff may be fine to watch live, but in a movie some judicious trimming should have been performed. Many scenes are endless.GOOD:  There is one fairly hot and erotic seduction scene at the end of the movie, thankfully involving Susannah York's character.BAD:  You have to sit through the first two hours and fifteen minutes of the movie to get to it.I guess that ""The Killing of Sister George"" must have seemed like pretty ""adult"", edgy stuff back in 1968, perhaps making people not mind as much that they had to sit through the many aspects of the movie that aren't very good: in the end, after all, they could say that they saw the movie that was the talk of the town.  Now, alas, you'll likely tell yourself that you saw a whiny, talky, fairly dull movie that has one or two elements (Susannah York and the one sex scene at the end) that keep it from being a total headache-inducing experience.To end on a polite note, the DVD features a clean, sharp widescreen image.  There are no extras, however.  Not one.  But don't worry, after watching this you won't be seeking any extras out.  Oh, well... so much for ending on a polite note.",2,"Watchable for Susannah York and a bit of the naughty at the end, but that's it",1146009600,"04 26, 2006",2006,3470,"['own', 'fault', 'guess', 'knew', 'was', 'provocative', 'angle', 'Killing', 'Sister', 'George', 'title', 'thought', 'addition', 'naughty', 'stuff', ""'d"", 'be', 'getting', 'murder', 'mystery', 'kind', 'sounded', 'good', 'little', 'mystery', 'little', 'sex', 'what', 'more', 'can', 'one', 'ask', 'Alas', 'murder', 'mystery', 'title', 'refers', 'Beryl', 'Reid', 'actress', 'character', 'worrying', 'not', 'Sister', 'George', 'character', 'TV', 'drama', 'going', 'be', 'killed', 'off', 'Okay', 'there', 'was', 'still', 'provocative', 'stuff', 'save', 'day', 'right', 'Well', 'here', 'things', 'are', 'sort', 'problematic', 'too', 'Anyway', 'here', 'good', 'bad', 'strange', 'little', 'drama.GOOD', 'movie', 'only', 'endless', 'actually', 'good', 'bit', 'shorter', 'three', 'hours', 'shade', '2', 'hours', '20', 'minutes', 'start', 'movie', 'now', 'three', 'hours', 'can', 'say', 'Thank', 'God', ""'m"", 'already', '40', 'minutes', 'ordeal', 'movie', 'BAD', 'Beryl', 'Reid', 'over-the-hill', 'actress', 'character', 'reprehensible', 'grating', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'fact', 'lesbian', 'have', 'do', 'fact', 'abusive', 'whiny', 'shrill', 'Uggh.GOOD', 'Susannah', 'York', 'character', 'likable', 'pretty', 'interesting.BAD', 'Susannah', 'York', 'character', 'only', 'female', 'character', 'movie', 'who', 'likable', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'quick', 'aside', 'topic', 'swear', ""'m"", 'sure', 'lesbian', 'women', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'be', 'uniformally', 'portrayed', 'media', 'sultry', 'model', 'types', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'appreciate', 'being', 'uniformly', 'portrayed', 'opposite', 'extreme', 'are', 'here', 'example', 'exception', 'maybe', 'maybe', 'one', 'two', 'quick', 'walk-ons', 'scene', 'set', 'lesbian', 'bar', 'woman', 'long', 'bar', 'scene', 'man', 'other', 'way', 'put', 'Sorry', 'guys', 'L', 'Word', 'here.GOOD', 'nice', 'moralism', 'kept', 'minimum', 'was', 'need', 'part', 'film', 'makers', 'have', 'lesbian', 'characters', 'commit', 'suicide', 'meet', 'other', 'type', 'major', 'tragedy', 'Beryl', 'Reid', 'character', ""n't"", 'turn', 'out', 'too', 'well', 'end', 'only', 'creep', 'not', 'lesbian.BAD', 'movie', 'roots', 'stage', 'several', 'long', 'talky', 'stage-bound', 'sequences', 'sort', 'stuff', 'may', 'be', 'fine', 'watch', 'live', 'movie', 'judicious', 'trimming', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'performed', 'Many', 'scenes', 'are', 'endless.GOOD', 'one', 'fairly', 'hot', 'erotic', 'seduction', 'scene', 'end', 'movie', 'thankfully', 'involving', 'Susannah', 'York', 'character.BAD', 'have', 'sit', 'first', 'two', 'hours', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'movie', 'get', 'it.I', 'guess', 'Killing', 'Sister', 'George', 'must', 'have', 'seemed', 'pretty', 'adult', 'edgy', 'stuff', 'back', '1968', 'perhaps', 'making', 'people', 'not', 'mind', 'much', 'had', 'sit', 'many', 'aspects', 'movie', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'end', 'could', 'say', 'saw', 'movie', 'was', 'talk', 'town', 'Now', 'alas', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'tell', 'saw', 'whiny', 'talky', 'fairly', 'dull', 'movie', 'one', 'two', 'elements', 'Susannah', 'York', 'one', 'sex', 'scene', 'end', 'keep', 'being', 'total', 'headache-inducing', 'experience.To', 'end', 'polite', 'note', 'DVD', 'clean', 'sharp', 'widescreen', 'image', 'are', 'extras', 'however', 'Not', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'watching', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'seeking', 'extras', 'out', 'Oh', 'well', 'so', 'much', 'ending', 'polite', 'note']",N/A

547529,A2HWOG9BURRUE1,B00004KHDT,profile,"[11, 11]","The Killing of Sister George (1968) is Robert Aldritch's masterpiece: one of the most harrowing films ever made on the subject of show business and masochistic relationships. Cynical yet painfully human, it is far superior to his much more well-known Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?. Beryl Reid, Susannah York & Coral Browne are magnificent and their performances pack an intense emotional wallop. The fact that the movie's principals are lesbians likely prevented people from appreciating the film for its immense merits. Beryl Reid stars as June Buckridge, an aging, overweight actress who plays Sister George, a beloved character on a hokey British soap opera about village life. Susannah York is Alice, or 'Childie' as George refers to her, George's younger, live-in lover who likes to play with dolls and act coy. Their complex, love-hate relationship provides the crux of the film, while George's career hitting the skids in conjunction with increasingly outrageous behavior and growing alcoholism moves the characters towards emotional and personal disaster. Coral Browne gives the performance of her career as Mrs. Croft, the BBC executive who vies for the affections of Childie over George. One particularly memorable scene showcases George & Childie attending a local lesbian bar as Laurel & Hardy, with Mrs. Croft coming over to deliver George the bad news that she has been removed from the show. The notorious sex scene between Childie and Mrs. Croft is both explicit and remarkably restrained and psychologically revealing. Note must also be made of Patricia Medina's sensitive performance as Betty Thaxter, the owner of a local house of prostitution and a personal confidante of George.",5,Masterpiece,1165190400,"12 4, 2006",2006,1701,"['Killing', 'Sister', 'George', '1968', 'Robert', 'Aldritch', 'masterpiece', 'one', 'most', 'harrowing', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'subject', 'show', 'business', 'masochistic', 'relationships', 'Cynical', 'yet', 'painfully', 'human', 'far', 'superior', 'much', 'more', 'well-known', 'Happened', 'Baby', 'Jane', 'Beryl', 'Reid', 'Susannah', 'York', 'Coral', 'Browne', 'are', 'magnificent', 'performances', 'pack', 'intense', 'emotional', 'wallop', 'fact', 'movie', 'principals', 'are', 'lesbians', 'likely', 'prevented', 'people', 'appreciating', 'film', 'immense', 'merits', 'Beryl', 'Reid', 'stars', 'June', 'Buckridge', 'aging', 'overweight', 'actress', 'who', 'Sister', 'George', 'beloved', 'character', 'hokey', 'British', 'soap', 'opera', 'village', 'life', 'Susannah', 'York', 'Alice', 'George', 'refers', 'George', 'younger', 'live-in', 'lover', 'who', 'play', 'dolls', 'act', 'coy', 'complex', 'love-hate', 'relationship', 'crux', 'film', 'George', 'career', 'hitting', 'skids', 'conjunction', 'increasingly', 'outrageous', 'behavior', 'growing', 'alcoholism', 'characters', 'towards', 'emotional', 'personal', 'disaster', 'Coral', 'Browne', 'performance', 'career', 'Mrs.', 'Croft', 'BBC', 'executive', 'who', 'affections', 'Childie', 'George', 'One', 'particularly', 'memorable', 'scene', 'showcases', 'George', 'Childie', 'attending', 'local', 'lesbian', 'bar', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'Mrs.', 'Croft', 'coming', 'deliver', 'George', 'bad', 'news', 'been', 'removed', 'show', 'notorious', 'sex', 'scene', 'Childie', 'Mrs.', 'Croft', 'explicit', 'remarkably', 'restrained', 'psychologically', 'revealing', 'Note', 'must', 'also', 'be', 'made', 'Patricia', 'Medina', 'sensitive', 'performance', 'Betty', 'Thaxter', 'owner', 'local', 'house', 'prostitution', 'personal', 'confidante', 'George']",N/A

547531,A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW,B00004KHDT,The Peripatetic Reader,"[0, 0]","Beryl Ried, in the role of her career, plays a likeable character in a British soap opera named George, and everyone outside the studio calls her George. The real George is boorish, brutish, churlish, confrontational, crude, inconsiderate, and prone to mood swings when inebriated, which is often, every quality not possessed by the character she portrays on television. She is involved in a same-sex relationship with a younger, naive, woman, played by Susanna York. George is verbally and emotionally, but not physically, abusive to her younger partner. George is also a raving prima donna at work, constantly issuing demands and demanding special treatment, ... but does not fully realize her professional and personal life is about to fall apart.The sexual orientation of the characters in this fine movie is largely irrelevant to the story. York's character is vulnerable and somewhat emotionally  arrested. The only reason she is in a relationship with George at all is that she takes whatever abuse George dishes out. The appeal in this movie is not the titillation of the main characters' personal life, but how common this type of abusive relationship exists in today's society. This dysfunction can be found in husband/wife, parent/child, boss/employee, or in any of a variety of relationships. This is a movie about a dysfunctional relationship and the life crisis it produces in the people involved, ... who just happen to be in a same-sex relationship.This is a morality play of what a life in crisis looks like and how not to resolve it. George's usual tactic had been to bully people to get her way. For apparently the first time in her life, throwing her weight around does not work, hence the drama in this film.George meets her match. Her emotional and professional rival is an executive at the BBC, played by Coral Browne. She is elegant, professional and soft-spoken, everything that George is not. She also has eyes on George's partner, who she takes her under her wing as a prot&eacute;g&eacute;, ostensibly showing an interest in her poetry.Aldrich's direction is sensitive and pays attention to every detail in the dynamics between the characters. The climax (no pun intended) of the movie is where the Browne character becomes intimate with York's. For several minutes -- an eternity in movie time  -- they share no words. They communicate only with the expressions on their faces and in their own furtive motions. The moment they share is intimate and surely must rank among the most sensuous in movie history.  It earned this movie an ""X"" rating. The movie rating is a reflection of the culture of that day and time and is tame by today's standards.",5,Superb Character Study -- Ten Stars,1380931200,"10 5, 2013",2013,2676,"['Beryl', 'Ried', 'role', 'career', 'likeable', 'character', 'British', 'soap', 'opera', 'named', 'George', 'everyone', 'studio', 'George', 'real', 'George', 'boorish', 'brutish', 'churlish', 'confrontational', 'crude', 'inconsiderate', 'prone', 'mood', 'swings', 'when', 'inebriated', 'often', 'quality', 'not', 'possessed', 'character', 'television', 'involved', 'same-sex', 'relationship', 'younger', 'naive', 'woman', 'played', 'Susanna', 'York', 'George', 'verbally', 'emotionally', 'not', 'physically', 'abusive', 'younger', 'partner', 'George', 'also', 'raving', 'prima', 'donna', 'work', 'constantly', 'issuing', 'demands', 'demanding', 'special', 'treatment', 'not', 'fully', 'realize', 'professional', 'personal', 'life', 'fall', 'apart.The', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'characters', 'fine', 'movie', 'largely', 'irrelevant', 'story', 'York', 'character', 'vulnerable', 'somewhat', 'emotionally', 'arrested', 'only', 'reason', 'relationship', 'George', 'abuse', 'George', 'out', 'appeal', 'movie', 'not', 'titillation', 'main', 'characters', 'personal', 'life', 'how', 'common', 'type', 'abusive', 'relationship', 'today', 'society', 'dysfunction', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'husband/wife', 'parent/child', 'boss/employee', 'variety', 'relationships', 'movie', 'dysfunctional', 'relationship', 'life', 'crisis', 'people', 'involved', 'who', 'just', 'happen', 'be', 'same-sex', 'relationship.This', 'morality', 'play', 'what', 'life', 'crisis', 'looks', 'how', 'not', 'resolve', 'George', 'usual', 'tactic', 'had', 'been', 'bully', 'people', 'get', 'way', 'apparently', 'first', 'time', 'life', 'throwing', 'weight', 'around', 'not', 'work', 'hence', 'drama', 'film.George', 'match', 'emotional', 'professional', 'rival', 'executive', 'BBC', 'played', 'Coral', 'Browne', 'elegant', 'professional', 'soft-spoken', 'everything', 'George', 'not', 'also', 'eyes', 'George', 'partner', 'who', 'wing', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'ostensibly', 'showing', 'interest', 'poetry.Aldrich', 'direction', 'sensitive', 'attention', 'detail', 'dynamics', 'characters', 'climax', 'pun', 'intended', 'movie', 'where', 'Browne', 'character', 'intimate', 'York', 'several', 'minutes', 'eternity', 'movie', 'time', 'share', 'words', 'communicate', 'only', 'expressions', 'own', 'furtive', 'motions', 'moment', 'share', 'intimate', 'surely', 'must', 'rank', 'most', 'sensuous', 'movie', 'history', 'earned', 'movie', 'X', 'rating', 'movie', 'rating', 'reflection', 'culture', 'day', 'time', 'tame', 'today', 'standards']",N/A

She manages to take a character that could have so easliy slid into camp caricature and make her an actual human being.  At all times she projects the humanity in George, even when she is acting like a schreechy seven year old with ADD: boozing it up, being needlessly abusive to her girlfriend, huffily walking out on her TV show (even though she's in a precarious position on it).  She's shrill, foolish, self-destructive and a bit mean, but Reed manages to make her also charming and sometimes even sweet.Not that the ham-handed direction by Aldrich helps.  We're presented with mega-closeups of Reed and especially Coral Browne that seem designed to make them look as bad as possible.  Not that he does better by the heterosexuals in the cast: the people involved in her BBC program are presented little better than circus freaks, or predatory animals in the big bad TV jungle.In some ways, the movie is hilariouly dated.  We are treated to a long sequence in might have been an actual lesbian bar- which is presented as if it were the most shocking think in the world.  It seems rather sweet, looking back at it 30-odd years later, and about as threatening as a high-school sock hop.There is one sex scene that would most likely be rated light R today, other than that, this is an overlong TV movie.
