1503083,A2NT1F84CD2T4Y,B005T3P28I,Jen S.,"[8, 9]","We now own every single title that Preschool Prep has released.  My 3 yr old son cannot get enough of these things! He acts out the ""characters"" from the movies and this one is no exception.  Additionally, since he has complete letter recognition thanks to Meet the Letters, after watching this movie he can point to the letters he sees and make some of the sounds they make.  I'm impressed, he's entertained & learning.  Couldn't ask for more.  Thanks for another quality product!!",5,"Great, just like all the other Preschool Prep!",1322006400,"11 23, 2011",2011,482,"['now', 'own', 'single', 'title', 'Preschool', 'Prep', 'released', '3', 'yr', 'old', 'son', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'enough', 'things', 'out', 'characters', 'movies', 'one', 'exception', 'Additionally', 'complete', 'letter', 'recognition', 'thanks', 'Meet', 'Letters', 'watching', 'movie', 'can', 'point', 'letters', 'make', 'sounds', 'make', ""'m"", 'impressed', 'entertained', 'learning', 'Could', ""n't"", 'ask', 'more', 'Thanks', 'quality', 'product']",Meet the Phonics - Letter Sounds
