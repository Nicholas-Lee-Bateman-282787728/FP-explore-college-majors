Tommy plays a minor role but is the only character who does not overact as a compensation for terrible writing. And that is the great flaw here since it is generally well cast. The writing is horrible and trying to find a laugh is not easy... a few smiles maybe... and I was in the mood for a good laugh. Mind you, I do like most comedies... event those the critics do not like.

That scene was hilarious, then they cause a havoc at the assembly and the students decide to skip school and go party at the principal's house but unfortunately the principal finds out about it he is MAD!! There are some hilarious scenes at the party where I won't mention, then the principal gives the students a Saturday detention and the students claim that the government sucks and the principal wants the students to write a 500 word letter to the president about how they feel, then the president reads the letter and he really thought well of it and he invites the students to Washington D.C. to express themselves about how they feel about the school system, we then get to meet Senator John Lerman who is a bad guy cause he wants to make the president a laughing stock and he wants to become the president and the students go off to Washington D.C. and there are a bunch of hilarious moments throughout the movie which I'm going to keep for myself, and Tommy Chong plays the stoner bus driver who is really hilarious throughout the movie.I was surprised to hear that the movie got really bad reviews from the critics and I think that their problem is that they don't have much of an open mind and it bombed in the box office which was unfortunate, if you're in the mood for a comedy where you just want to sit down and laugh, this movie is recommended.",5,Watch it with an open mind and you'll be surprised,1082678400,"04 23, 2004",2004,2251,"[""'ll"", 'never', 'forget', 'when', 'heard', 'Tommy', 'Chong', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'movie', 'previews', 'was', 'Cheech', 'Chong', 'fan', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'movie', 'theater', 'cause', 'was', ""n't"", 'old', 'enough', 'watch', 'rented', 'family', 'were', 'laughing', 'butts', 'taped', 'when', 'came', 'Starz', 'movie', 'channel', 'tape', 'got', 'destroyed', 'few', 'months', 'later', 'watching', 'constantly', 'few', 'years', 'decided', 'buy', 'movie', 'VHS', 'not', 'sure', 'released', 'DVD', 'not', ""'m"", 'glad', 'own', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'place', 'Fairmount', 'High', 'School', 'somewhere', 'located', 'Ohio', 'where', 'persistant', 'principal', 'sure', 'students', 'show', 'up', 'class', 'time', 'here', 'meet', 'main', 'characters', 'Dags', 'Reggie', 'who', 'are', 'stoners', 'show', 'up', 'late', 'class', 'old', 'Jeep', 'crashed', 'pole', 'principal', 'brand', 'new', 'car', 'scene', 'was', 'hilarious', 'then', 'cause', 'havoc', 'assembly', 'students', 'decide', 'skip', 'school', 'go', 'party', 'principal', 'house', 'unfortunately', 'principal', 'out', 'MAD', 'are', 'hilarious', 'scenes', 'party', 'where', 'wo', ""n't"", 'mention', 'then', 'principal', 'students', 'Saturday', 'detention', 'students', 'claim', 'government', 'sucks', 'principal', 'students', 'write', '500', 'word', 'letter', 'president', 'how', 'feel', 'then', 'president', 'letter', 'really', 'thought', 'well', 'students', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'express', 'how', 'feel', 'school', 'system', 'then', 'get', 'meet', 'Senator', 'John', 'Lerman', 'who', 'bad', 'guy', 'cause', 'make', 'president', 'laughing', 'stock', 'become', 'president', 'students', 'go', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'are', 'bunch', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'movie', ""'m"", 'going', 'keep', 'Tommy', 'Chong', 'stoner', 'bus', 'driver', 'who', 'really', 'hilarious', 'movie.I', 'was', 'surprised', 'hear', 'movie', 'got', 'really', 'bad', 'reviews', 'critics', 'think', 'problem', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'open', 'mind', 'bombed', 'box', 'office', 'was', 'unfortunate', ""'re"", 'mood', 'comedy', 'where', 'just', 'want', 'sit', 'down', 'laugh', 'movie', 'recommended']",National Lampoon's Senior Trip VHS

I love this film. I'm a huge Kevin McDonald fan and the role he plays is just priceless. So, seeing that this film finally came to DVD, I'm not overjoyed, I'm ecstatic.The film is simple. Really bad class make a foolish mistake after Principal tells them to, Senator with bad plot to President sees bad class, and wants to bring bad class to Capitol Hill to ruin President. It's simple, see? But, the antics that follow are so golden, so hysterical. Especially Chong's role as the sedated bus driver. Matt Frewer is also classic as well as Jeremy Renner and Rob Moore...both who should be in more films.The film also boasts a killer soundtrack that I will always listen to, to this day. With rock and a great cast and some hysterical moments, this is a definite to your DVD collection. It's a bit dated, mostly because the times and all, but it's so good.

388373,A1SIAC1Q9Z3KK4,6303916880,Rusty Roberts,"[1, 2]","I remember the first time i watched this movie, from the scene were the two guys stumble out of an old mail jeep (with an immense smoke cloud  following them) after they just ran into their school's flagpole, i laughed  as hard as i could and i didnt stop until the credits were done.  Its one  of those few movies that actually makes you hurt because your laughing so  much.  Tommy Chong and that guy from the kids in the hall (i cant believe i  can't remember his name, he was my favorite)both do a great job in this  movie.  Tommy basically plays the old chong character, but this time he's a  school bus driver, and he actually reminds me of this one bus driver i had  that let us do anything.  Kevin Mcdonald (I remember now) does a amazing  comic job as a psychopathic, crossing guard, star-trek junkie who somehow  believes that one of the students is a Klingon ambasador and must be  termanated.  The basic story isnt anything special, basically the kids have  to get to washington in a few days to speak at a senate hearing on  education reform.  But the comic brilliance of the scenes that actually  take place in this movie are pure gold.  I can't believe this didnt come  out in theatres (or did it?) because im sure it would be a smash with the  youth market.  It really does rank up there with Kingpin, maybe a little  less funny, but if you like Kingpin then theres no doubt you'd love this.  But please, if you are offended by ANYTHING, then dont watch this movie,  you'll just want to complain about how offensive or mean-spirited it is.  As a side note, I dont understand how people can actually be offended by  something they see in a movie, can't they just forgot their ego for a  second and laugh?  Also there are two versions of the movie, one edited and  one uncut.  I'd say go with the edited, because all of the scenes that were  cut desearved to be cut, they just were not that funny and kind of brought  the whole movie down.
