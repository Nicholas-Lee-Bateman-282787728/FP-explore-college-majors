However, this was the funniest thing I have seen in years!  Dame Edna is unbelievably qick-witted:  Upon finding Vaseline stored in a kitchen cupboard with two rolling pins:  ""I don't believe I know THAT recipe!"".The whole premise of this game show is perfectly suited to Dame Edna's whacky sense of humor, and her facial expressions are hysterical, to say the least.  I ended up buying this because it showed up at Amazon.com as a recommendation for me because I bought both currently available French & Saunders DVDs.  Although I was quite amused by the F&S; DVDs, this British import really hit the spot.  After watching the first Neighborhood Watch episode on the DVD (there are 6 total episodes), I thought that the novelty would wear off pretty quickly.  I was wrong.  Each episode will have you glued to the TV, laughing from start to finish.  I can't wait to share it with friends.",5,Hilarious!!!!,1026345600,"07 11, 2002",2002,983,"['lot', 'make', 'days', 'think', ""'ve"", 'become', 'jaded', 'old', 'age', '35', 'However', 'was', 'funniest', 'thing', 'have', 'seen', 'years', 'Dame', 'Edna', 'unbelievably', 'qick-witted', 'finding', 'Vaseline', 'stored', 'kitchen', 'cupboard', 'two', 'rolling', 'pins', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'know', 'recipe', '.The', 'whole', 'premise', 'game', 'show', 'perfectly', 'suited', 'Dame', 'Edna', 'whacky', 'sense', 'humor', 'facial', 'expressions', 'are', 'hysterical', 'say', 'least', 'ended', 'up', 'buying', 'showed', 'up', 'Amazon.com', 'recommendation', 'bought', 'currently', 'available', 'French', 'Saunders', 'DVDs', 'was', 'quite', 'amused', 'F', 'S', 'DVDs', 'British', 'import', 'really', 'hit', 'spot', 'watching', 'first', 'Neighborhood', 'Watch', 'episode', 'DVD', 'are', '6', 'total', 'episodes', 'thought', 'novelty', 'would', 'wear', 'off', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'was', 'wrong', 'episode', 'will', 'have', 'glued', 'TV', 'laughing', 'start', 'finish', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'share', 'friends']",N/A

And she had a winner with this game show as far as laughs are concerned. Well, the contestants thought it was a game show about houses, but it turned out to be about one contestant's house in particular. The poor lady of the house is subjected to a live TV camera going into the house when she is sitting in the studio. And that is when the shocks and embarrassment begin. Dame Edna stops at nothing, including opening any drawer and cupboard she wants to see what's inside. I won't tell you the things she uncovers and the howls of laughter from the audience that go with it.The first DVD is very, very good but  the second series has a few more surprises. At one time on the 2nd series Dame Edna was given a response that was so stupid (there is no other word for it) that even she, with all her composure and great performing abilities, was not able to keep control and broke up laughing.If you can get both DVD's you will thank yourself. If not, I suggest this one (the second series) and you will find yourself inviting many friends over who must see it.For your information, 6 shows on the DVD and countless laughs!",5,A total riot!!!!!!!!!!!!,1071792000,"12 19, 2003",2003,1205,"['Being', 'Melbourne', 'Dame', 'Edna', 'have', 'known', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'remember', 'had', 'winner', 'game', 'show', 'as', 'far', 'laughs', 'are', 'concerned', 'Well', 'contestants', 'thought', 'was', 'game', 'show', 'houses', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'one', 'contestant', 'house', 'particular', 'poor', 'lady', 'house', 'subjected', 'live', 'TV', 'camera', 'going', 'house', 'when', 'sitting', 'studio', 'when', 'shocks', 'embarrassment', 'begin', 'Dame', 'Edna', 'nothing', 'including', 'opening', 'drawer', 'cupboard', 'see', 'what', 'inside', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'things', 'uncovers', 'howls', 'laughter', 'audience', 'go', 'it.The', 'first', 'DVD', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'second', 'series', 'few', 'more', 'surprises', 'one', 'time', '2nd', 'series', 'Dame', 'Edna', 'was', 'given', 'response', 'was', 'so', 'stupid', 'other', 'word', 'even', 'composure', 'great', 'performing', 'abilities', 'was', 'not', 'able', 'keep', 'control', 'broke', 'up', 'can', 'get', 'DVD', 'will', 'thank', 'not', 'suggest', 'one', 'second', 'series', 'will', 'find', 'inviting', 'many', 'friends', 'who', 'must', 'see', 'it.For', 'information', '6', 'shows', 'DVD', 'countless', 'laughs']",N/A

I've been a fan of Dame Edna's for quite some time and have enjoyed her on TV (on Fox's ""Ally McBeal"" and her short lived show in the late 90s) and on the printed page (her autobiograpy is a hoot!).  This dvd doesn't disappoint a true Dame Edna fan.  This hilarious British game show puts the self appointed ""spin doctor to the Queen of England"" in her best element.  Taking stunned housewives on a unexpected tour of their home while giving hilarious observations in her usual sharp tongue, this Dame delivers true comedy.  Her ""interesting"" choices in fashion and her wonderful facial expressions only add to the fun.  I'm definitely gonna get the 1st one too.

483660,A15Q9YEG1XPEJN,6305944237,Get What We Give,"[0, 0]","Dame Edna is truly someone to be adored!  I recently was fortunate enough to see her live in Atlanta.  I can honestly say that I have never, in all my years, seen anything as funny or hilariously irreverant as Dame Edna.  My 80 year old father said he thought he was going to pass out from laughter; that it was the funniest thing he'd ever seen!All that said, this DVD is a compilation of Dame Edna's television series in Austrailia. It's hard to really put a classification on this show. It's a comedy, that's certain. However, beyond that, it is part Room Invaders and part game show. While each segment has a humorous moment or two, it is difficult to watch them back to back, because they are exceedingly similar. Edna makes similar jabs to each participant.The premise is that someone from the studio audience is called forward to the stage and unbeknownst to them at the very same time a camera crew is going through that person's house - all the while Edna makes cutting, snide, and humorous remarks about the contents of the house and drawers of the person. In the US, this show would be produced to be very mean-spirited. In Austrailia, it is not; it is uncomfortably humorous.Not as good as any of Edna's live shows, but maybe something to give yourself a few chuckles.",5,Not as good as seeing her in person,1076544000,"02 12, 2004",2004,1280,"['Dame', 'Edna', 'truly', 'someone', 'be', 'adored', 'recently', 'was', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'see', 'live', 'Atlanta', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'have', 'never', 'years', 'seen', 'anything', 'funny', 'hilariously', 'irreverant', 'Dame', 'Edna', '80', 'year', 'old', 'father', 'said', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'pass', 'out', 'laughter', 'was', 'funniest', 'thing', ""'d"", 'ever', 'seen', 'said', 'DVD', 'compilation', 'Dame', 'Edna', 'television', 'series', 'Austrailia', 'hard', 'really', 'put', 'classification', 'show', 'comedy', 'certain', 'However', 'part', 'Room', 'Invaders', 'part', 'game', 'show', 'segment', 'humorous', 'moment', 'two', 'difficult', 'watch', 'back', 'back', 'are', 'exceedingly', 'similar', 'Edna', 'similar', 'jabs', 'participant.The', 'premise', 'someone', 'studio', 'audience', 'called', 'forward', 'stage', 'unbeknownst', 'very', 'same', 'time', 'camera', 'crew', 'going', 'person', 'house', 'while', 'Edna', 'cutting', 'snide', 'humorous', 'remarks', 'contents', 'house', 'drawers', 'person', 'US', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'produced', 'be', 'very', 'mean-spirited', 'Austrailia', 'not', 'uncomfortably', 'humorous.Not', 'as', 'good', 'Edna', 'live', 'shows', 'maybe', 'something', 'give', 'few', 'chuckles']",N/A

Schmidt ""boymitch""","[3, 3]","&quot;Say your prayers, cause we're going up your stairs!&quot;I'm not sure if this is an original concept, but it is a SCREAM nonetheless. Barry Humphries, Dame Edna, does a grand job with costume, wit, audience interaction, humor and even wrote the theme song. His facial expressions and comedic timing are unmatched!He takes unsuspecting ladies from the audience, who think they are going to play a quiz show about houses, and actually takes the viewers on a LIVE TOUR of the interior of their homes. It's a riot!! The show gets permission from the &quot;sneaky&quot; husband and they film while the wife is away. All the dirty laundry, and YES, there is some of that, is aired!!It's obvious they learned a LOT from the first season when they shot the second season.  There are more hijinks, special moments and pranks played on the unsuspecting contestant than just going through their home.  My friends and I were sick from laughing so hard!Bottom line: $23.00 is a bit expensive for a DVD, but the comedic SHOCK value is priceless....and with six episodes for DVD, think of it as a little under four bucks a show...a good value for all the laughs!",5,"NW #2 is better than the first, Possums!!",1066003200,"10 13, 2003",2003,1153,"['quot', 'Say', 'prayers', 'cause', ""'re"", 'going', 'up', 'stairs', 'quot', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'original', 'concept', 'SCREAM', 'nonetheless', 'Barry', 'Humphries', 'Dame', 'Edna', 'grand', 'job', 'costume', 'wit', 'audience', 'interaction', 'humor', 'even', 'wrote', 'theme', 'song', 'facial', 'expressions', 'comedic', 'timing', 'are', 'unmatched', 'unsuspecting', 'ladies', 'audience', 'who', 'think', 'are', 'going', 'play', 'quiz', 'show', 'houses', 'actually', 'viewers', 'LIVE', 'TOUR', 'interior', 'homes', 'riot', 'show', 'permission', 'quot', 'quot', 'husband', 'film', 'wife', 'away', 'dirty', 'laundry', 'YES', 'aired', 'obvious', 'learned', 'LOT', 'first', 'season', 'when', 'shot', 'second', 'season', 'are', 'more', 'hijinks', 'special', 'moments', 'pranks', 'played', 'unsuspecting', 'contestant', 'just', 'going', 'home', 'friends', 'were', 'sick', 'laughing', 'so', 'hard', 'Bottom', 'line', '23.00', 'bit', 'expensive', 'DVD', 'comedic', 'SHOCK', 'value', 'priceless', '.and', 'six', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'think', 'little', 'four', 'bucks', 'show', 'good', 'value', 'laughs']",N/A
