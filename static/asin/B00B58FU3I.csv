Reason one being it is roughly an hour and half comedy special.  Reason two would be the prank he did to his son in order to get him to put on his deorderant (have to order the show to see what I mean by the pank).  Reason three would have to be the bonus section with the Magic Mike story as an exrta to the show.  Reason four is the trip to Saudia Arbria and who he preformed for and the story behind that was very funny and enjoyable.  Almost the whole show made me cry from my gut hurting so much from the laughing, but reason five and the best one in my viewpoint was the Racist Gift Basket he did to a comedian friend of his (you have to buy the show to see the whole story behind it).
