1297364,A33EN2ZL2MS0CI,B002WY64IY,Compay,"[13, 15]","Make no mistake about it, this film is almost entirely patterned after the Bourne series.  But with that being said, there are more than a few reasons why you should check it out.Stephen Dorff plays XIII, the lethal one-man army who wakes up with a bullet hole and amnesia.  He enlists the help of a beautiful European woman, while getting the occasional flashback of his past.  Sound familiar yet?  What sets this movie apart from the Bourne series are several conspiracy angles, and to its credit, the film keeps you fairly entertained.The good: The editing is terrific.  Yann Herv&eacute; cuts the movie in a similar style that you'd see in Tony Scott flicks like Man on Fire.  Coincidentally, composer Nicolas Err&egrave;ra puts together a nice score that's reminiscent of Scott's film Deja Vu.  Director Duane Clark earned his stripes shooting countless episodes of CSI, and does a solid job with XIII.  While I thought Stephen Dorff was miscast in Felon, his previous film with Val Kilmer, I was happy with his work as XIII.The bad: Expect plot holes, and some laughingly implausible scenes, starting with the stunning Italian actress Caterina Murinos noticing XIII's collarbone tattoo.  As this was a TV miniseries, the fight choreography isn't as good as the Bourne series.  Val Kilmer, the king of straight to video Redbox flicks, offers a completely forgettable performance as the mysterious Mongoose.  Which is also a good thing, considering he gets only 10 minutes of screen time throughout the entire film.This was shot for TV, it was never meant to be a blockbuster film.  So with that in mind, if you can get past the fact that it's a Jason Bourne hijack, you'll actually find this movie entertaining.  I was honestly surprised, definitely give this one a watch.",4,Surprisingly Good for a Jason Bourne Ripoff,1267920000,"03 7, 2010",2010,1777,"['Make', 'mistake', 'film', 'almost', 'entirely', 'patterned', 'Bourne', 'series', 'being', 'said', 'are', 'more', 'few', 'reasons', 'why', 'should', 'check', 'out.Stephen', 'Dorff', 'XIII', 'lethal', 'one-man', 'army', 'who', 'up', 'bullet', 'hole', 'amnesia', 'help', 'beautiful', 'European', 'woman', 'getting', 'occasional', 'flashback', 'past', 'Sound', 'familiar', 'yet', 'What', 'movie', 'apart', 'Bourne', 'series', 'are', 'several', 'conspiracy', 'angles', 'credit', 'film', 'fairly', 'entertained.The', 'good', 'editing', 'terrific', 'Yann', 'Herv', 'eacute', 'movie', 'similar', 'style', ""'d"", 'see', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'flicks', 'Man', 'Fire', 'Coincidentally', 'composer', 'Nicolas', 'Err', 'egrave', 'ra', 'together', 'nice', 'score', 'reminiscent', 'Scott', 'film', 'Deja', 'Vu', 'Director', 'Duane', 'Clark', 'earned', 'stripes', 'shooting', 'countless', 'episodes', 'CSI', 'solid', 'job', 'XIII', 'thought', 'Stephen', 'Dorff', 'was', 'miscast', 'Felon', 'previous', 'film', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'was', 'happy', 'work', 'XIII.The', 'bad', 'Expect', 'plot', 'holes', 'laughingly', 'implausible', 'scenes', 'starting', 'stunning', 'Italian', 'actress', 'Caterina', 'Murinos', 'noticing', 'XIII', 'collarbone', 'tattoo', 'was', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'fight', 'choreography', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'Bourne', 'series', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'king', 'straight', 'video', 'Redbox', 'flicks', 'completely', 'forgettable', 'performance', 'mysterious', 'Mongoose', 'Which', 'also', 'good', 'thing', 'considering', 'only', '10', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'entire', 'film.This', 'was', 'shot', 'TV', 'was', 'never', 'meant', 'be', 'blockbuster', 'film', 'So', 'mind', 'can', 'get', 'fact', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'hijack', ""'ll"", 'actually', 'find', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'was', 'honestly', 'surprised', 'definitely', 'give', 'one', 'watch']",N/A

That, in and of itself, does not bother me as long as they do something with it to make it special or better. No such luck here.Here's the scoop. A female U.S. President is assassinated. The assassin is found hanging from a parachute in a tree with a bullet hole in him. Who is he? What really happened? Why are these government folk out to kill him? He needs to get on the stick to figure all this out and it's a rough road.I need to say, up front, that I didn't even bother with the second chapter because it just wasn't worth my time. I liked the idea. I like Stephen Dorff. There weren't many of the other actors I recognized so I took them as they came and I just wasn't impressed. This was just a dime store version of the Bourne flicks. They were great movies and tremendously clever. They made serious amounts of cash at the box office so I have to assume the movie going public also applauded them for their cleverness. So why did the producers of ""XIII"" think they had to give people a grade school version? There were enough elements here to make a good story. Was the writing that bad and the producers just didn't catch it? Stephen Dorff has been in some good, high-level projects, so what made him sign on here? He's good, but the dialogue he had to work with didn't let him build a character. It's a shame when a secondary character, the photo shop owner, has more going for her than the main character. Nothing in the production worked to raise this above the level of a run of the mill made for TV movie.Unless you're really needy for something to watch, I'd give this a pass.",3,Dumbed Down Bourne,1360195200,"02 7, 2013",2013,1744,"['others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'basic', 'set-up', 'here', 'special', 'ops', 'dude', 'shot', 'assignment', 'only', 'wake', 'up', 'amnesia', 'Bourne', 'series', 'rip-off', 'not', 'bother', 'as', 'long', 'do', 'something', 'make', 'special', 'better', 'such', 'luck', 'scoop', 'female', 'U.S.', 'President', 'assassinated', 'assassin', 'found', 'hanging', 'parachute', 'tree', 'bullet', 'hole', 'Who', 'What', 'really', 'happened', 'Why', 'are', 'government', 'folk', 'out', 'kill', 'get', 'stick', 'figure', 'out', 'rough', 'road.I', 'need', 'say', 'up', 'front', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'second', 'chapter', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'worth', 'time', 'liked', 'idea', 'like', 'Stephen', 'Dorff', 'were', ""n't"", 'many', 'other', 'actors', 'recognized', 'so', 'took', 'came', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'was', 'just', 'dime', 'store', 'version', 'Bourne', 'flicks', 'were', 'great', 'movies', 'tremendously', 'clever', 'made', 'serious', 'amounts', 'cash', 'box', 'office', 'so', 'have', 'assume', 'movie', 'going', 'public', 'also', 'applauded', 'cleverness', 'why', 'did', 'producers', 'XIII', 'think', 'had', 'give', 'people', 'grade', 'school', 'version', 'were', 'enough', 'elements', 'here', 'make', 'good', 'story', 'Was', 'writing', 'bad', 'producers', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', 'Stephen', 'Dorff', 'been', 'good', 'high-level', 'projects', 'what', 'made', 'sign', 'here', 'good', 'dialogue', 'had', 'work', 'did', ""n't"", 'let', 'build', 'character', 'shame', 'when', 'secondary', 'character', 'photo', 'shop', 'owner', 'more', 'going', 'main', 'character', 'Nothing', 'production', 'worked', 'raise', 'level', 'run', 'mill', 'made', 'TV', 'movie.Unless', ""'re"", 'really', 'needy', 'something', 'watch', ""'d"", 'give', 'pass']",N/A
1297367,AKB2PYODH0TKS,B002WY64IY,"Grey Wolffe ""Zeb Kantrowitz""","[4, 4]","Yes this could be called the Bourne Conspiracy.  The idea of a combat trained operative who escapes from a mission but has been shot in the head and has lost his memories except for flashes of 'pictures' from time to time.  This has been done by everyone from Alfred Hitchcock to Steven Spielberg, but if done well is a great story.  In this case it's very much s tightrope walk between ok and mediocre.  The President of the US is assassinated and the only picture that can be found of him is a CCTV through a car window, which shows the number 13 (XIII) tattooed on his left clavicle (not his neck).  But it turns out that he is not this man but someone who had face reconstruction to look like this man, who was killed in a shoot-out after the shooting.  The two me who were killed and killed the 'real' XIII, had tattoos of their own.So the whole question comes down to, who is number I.  Sounds a little like 'The Prisoner', except here the protagonist was No.6.  All this is wrapped up with an attempted coup d'etat by a group who wants to take over control of the US government and create a totalitarian state to protect us all from ourselves. Got that!  Needless to say the members of the 'Roman Numeral Conspiracy' need to get Thirteen, before he exposes them and their plans.  As always he has a 'friend' in the CIA who keeps helping him out (sounds a little like 'Person of Interest') with back-up and info.  Of course she's a looker as is the french woman who runs a photo shop in NYC.  In fact the woman all look like refugees from 'Miss Congeniality'.Val Kilmer is on the screen for all of 10 minutes of the 240 of the film.  His character is referred to the 'Mongoose' and he never has more than five words of dialogue at a time.  Mostly he looks like he's got hemorrhoids and is constipated on top of that.  He fires more bullets than words and sometimes shoots two guns at once like he's in an old 'B' movie western.  On top of everything else, he looks like the Pillsbury Doughboy.  At one point he has to run about fifty feet and I was afraid he was going to have a heart-attack.  It looked like they filmed him at five feet at a time.  A mannequin could have done his part, and probably do it better.If you keep in mind that this originally a comic book and then a graphic novel, it doesn't look artificial or camp.  I'm looking forward to the new series that's filmed by a Canadian company and will be shown in the States on REELZ cable network.  There will be a 'new' Thirteen because he's had surgery again because everyone in America saw his old face in the CCTV shot.

1297368,A26YFGY8BDEN2U,B002WY64IY,Jack Young,"[0, 3]","This is a limited review.It's a TV mini series (as what I believed), being a Canadian production. The plot was what my title suggested. In terms of actions, there were decent dosages. As what other reviewers said, if you like the Bourne series, you will like this show.As for suspense, the show's predictability was there. There may be 1 or 2 minor unknowns scenes, as the viewers were led to uncover the plots and identities of the ""anarchy team"".As it's a non-American production, I like to add the film tried to show via its characters, different types/classes of patriots. There were the genuine patriots, who valued the choice made by the people and would bite a bullet to defend the system. There were the mis-guided lofty patriots who thought that their high ideals and approaches were the best solutions for the people. As such these ideals should be imposed or ""forced-sold"" to the people if need be.Moving on to the real world, we have to add the lip-serving patriots. Those self-serving chickenhawks who waved the flag, compromised the nation's interest while advancing their personal ones. This is the moral/ethics dimension that the film tried to draw the audience to, while its remained a fairly predictable show.I give a 3 stars. If you choose to watch it to pass a lazy weekend afternoon, you will not regret watching it. It has all the decent actions of a movie, though it was to be screened as a TV miniseries.POST REVIEW AFTER-THOUGHTSI did not get to read the book that the show was based upon.

It felt like a mix ofNowhere Man - The Complete Seriesmeets 24, meets a longer (and worse version) ofBlind Horizon. Val Kilmer is in the latter film I mentioned, with Dorff playing Val's role in this series, and after spending three nauseating hours of XIII, I have to recommend the older film.The story follows an amnesia laden agent (Dorff) as he uncovers a vast conspiracy around an assassination of the US President, of which he is blamed for but cannot recall. Val Kilmer plays the bad guy who finds fifteen different ways in three hours to botch killing our hero. As the story progresses, we are treated to multiple jumpy-editing flashbacks that are as irritating as I have encountered (usually after each fade-to-black that would have been an ad). I timed roughly 10-15 minutes of flashy/jumpy filler from beginning to end. The story is rife with mistakes, plot holes and cliches, but it will maintain a decent level of entertainment for some.The Blu clarity is a mixed bag, as there are plenty of scenes with intentional grain, bad focusing, and bland colorings. The 5.1 is average throughout, with one or two reference points. The special features last 67 minutes and include behind the scenes on special effects, stunts, and interviews of Dorff and Kilmer. The entire hour is so mismanaged I cannot stress enough how this would be a waste of your time. The only two explanations I can come up with regarding Kilmer's interview on set, was that he was either intoxicated or he was deliberately messing with the crew to throw them off (he has to look around to remember what scene they are filming, then he describes the wrong scene, stops talking mid sentence and stares off into space, etc.). On Dorff's interview the opening question goes contrary to what the interviewer asked as Dorff became irritated with him. The point being, they should have re-shot that entire half hour into an actual professional looking supplement. The behind the scenes camera guy was mimicking the production as he never holds still so it gets old fast.I always enjoy watching Stephen McHattie (one of the leads from the Jesse Stone films), and Dorff is convincing. The amount of flubs, yeah-right moments and editing/filming styles make for a long watch, but there are a few highlights scattered throughout to keep the masses entertained.
