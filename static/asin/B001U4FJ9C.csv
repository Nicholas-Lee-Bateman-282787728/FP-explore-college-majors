1238439,A1JBC0F8VFNDOH,B001U4FJ9C,"Clinic Pharmacy Larry Auxier ""redlicktrout""","[3, 4]","A great,hypnotic western.I don't really understand why this flick is so good,maybe it's the super wide angle cinematography,Hermann's Hitchcockian music,Hathaway's economic direction which comes off more profound than mainline or characters thrown together to play out a non-plot,as you sense they are all are hiding themselves from each other.Wow,and there's the strangeness of it all,indians seen,and feared from afar,Susan Hayward,whatever happened to likes of her,who comes off as cold,a deceiver,probably bad to the bone, but,she throws out those heavy sexual vibes that's enough to make you want crawl through the TV screen and pat Cameron Mitchell on the back for trying to rape her.Watch Susan really ride her horse like Ben Johnson in drag.It's really pretty amazing stuff.Of course Gary Cooper and Richard Widmark are along for the ride also,and,like Susan, they really ride their horses,which makes for realism we are not used to these days,because old school hollywood was not computer graphic-ed to death and actors who were bold enough to get a major role in a major western had better be able to do some major horseback riding because insurance companies and lawyers were not a force to be reckoned with in the 1950's world of cinema production,which makes for a long gone realism,that has to be seen to be appreciated.Maybe it just all came together,for a few months in mexico,when Hathaway and company shot GOE,there's lots to watch,every frame is full to the brim of wide angle images and looks just right.Cooper,Widmark and Mitchell along with a doomed Mexican sidekick,throw in with Susan.They ride into indian country to rescue Susan's husband,who's gold mine fell on him,so he's trapped and hurt and that's basically the plot,but Hayward,Cooper etc. make this film so much more because of the complexities they interject into their characters.Widmark and cooper take on the distant indians in a closing shoot-out masterly filmed and edited by Hathaway.The final frames project one of the best Western endings ever,very cinematic,we are left dangling,no questions are answered,no ends come together,Hathaway's story has no convenient ending,he does give us a brilliant sunset with Cooper and Hayward therein,but where they went to from there?...we'll never know.Lesson to be learned,or the great truth of Garden of Evil.....if your gonna rape Susan Hayward,you'd better tie her up and gag her first because 1)she has no humor when it comes to rape2)she'll whip your a__ all over that cinemascoped creek bank,just like she did Cameron Mitchell.......thanks Susan,Gary etc.you were the best....",5,sometimes we forget...,1340755200,"06 27, 2012",2012,2613,"['great',

The problem is that the mine is far into the interior of Mexico and will take five days to get there. There are hundreds of vicious Indians waiting to pounce every step of the way. However, they don't do anything until later.  Widmark is a gambler, while Cooper is a former soldier who has ended up in Tampico awaiting a boat home.  Cameron Mitchell is also along as a greedy, horny young fool. They don't know each other before Hayward strides into the cantina and offers big bucks to them to help her with her hubby.

There was some concern on the part of an often consulted and useful web site that this disc would keep the sub titles on the screen regardless of which buttons were pushed. I am pleased to report that my Oppo doesn't do this. When you consider that this is in the original CinemaScope ratio, the sharpness and color consistency is astonishing with the same blue sky in every background. The makers of THE SEARCHERS knew they had something special on their hands when they shot it in VistaVision. The same can be said of Bernard Hermann's score for this splendidly scenic, well acted, and weirdly brilliant Western. The 1950's knew all about different layers of meaning and symbolism, from INVADERS FROM MARS to TARZAN'S GREATEST ADVENTURE.

1238443,AZ1GH4XD61MDH,B001U4FJ9C,New England Pat,"[0, 0]","This solemn adventure features the great Gary Cooper and a top cast in a western that never received its proper due. The plot is about a rescue mission into desolate mountain country to save a woman's husband trapped in a mine. However, it's the trek back to Puerto Miguel that puts the party in grave danger from hostile Indians. The film details the motives of the rescue party of diverse types and touches on the darker sides of human failings such as greed, untrustworthiness and cowardice. Cooper is at his laconic best with one or two syllable answers to his partners' questions about his background. He is self-contained, alert, understanding and heroic and the group's acknowledged leader. Susan Hayward, in one of her few western roles, matches Cooper with an intense yet vulnerable portrayal of a woman with personal demons regarding her husband. Richard Widmark, a gambler and Cameron Mitchell, a bounty hunter, are also in top form and round out the film's main characters. Widmark is predictably icy and surly, a lean thesping of a character seemingly written just for him. Mitchell has a thankless role of a boastful rowdy with a hair-trigger temper. The movie's highlight is the group's flight from the Indians through the mountains in their attempt to reach safety.
