907099,A1VQBHHXIKHIGS,B0009K7QZS,A Customer,"[3, 3]","The first season was good, the second was great, and the third and final season made the show a legend.If you start at the beginning of this season, and I know you will, you'll be disappointed for a few episodes.  They had to get their groove back or something.  And then, with no gradual transition whatsoever, the writing will leap into the stratosphere and remind you why you love this show.  It is simply awesome, and it isn't dated.One thing they did at the start of this season was try to raise the level of menace on the martial arts, but it was already there.At times, the verbal sparring was even better than the kung fu, and you know how great that was.I've written before that you should use superlatives sparingly, and one memorable essay mentioned car horns in China.  I could have instead mentioned Kwai Chang Caine's gold silks.  When he puts those on, it's clobberin time!In my review of the second season, I realized that I'd never seen Caine eat with chopsticks.  And just to remain so petty, he does it here, and he eats just fine.  Hey, I lived in China for 6 years.  I notice these things.When I ordered these DVDs, I envisioned using them in my class, encouraging my students to point out the inaccuracies because they'd be hyper-motivated to do so.  In English, which is what I was teaching.  But the timing was a little off, as I quit teaching that class a few weeks before I got these DVDs.Oh well.  Looking over it myself, the inaccuracies are minor.  Master Kan should in fact be called Master Chen, for example.  But the big details, which are why we love this show and why it's timeless, are absolutely spot on.

907100,A1MRKBLQ36BSN8,B0009K7QZS,Amazon Customer,"[8, 11]","The ideas were running out by this series. There are lots of duff episodes, some truly ridiculous story lines and some REALLY poor acting. It is still fun to watch though !One or two characters are resurrected from the previous series (when Cain revists them) - which is a bit odd! It is also not too clear how messages are sent and received by various nomadic characters who hardly have a PO Box to collect their mail!!!It is good fun spotting the Camelot sets (which seem even more obvious here than before) and the sets reused within this series for different places (the mine where he finds his brother, and the cave where the boys are held hostage are identical sets). Also odd is that quite a few scenes are set underground (caves, mines, rock falls etc) and they all have full daylight with no obvious lighting available.The strangest thing about the DVD set is that the episodes are in the wrong order (presumably the studio didn't do their homeowrk on the transmission dates or else they were transmitted in a very strange sequence). There are 3 episodes leading up to ""Full Circle"" which is obviously meant to be the final episode, and then 3 more episodes are tagged on aftwards - one set in China but in two Cain has apparently lost his brother again (having just spent two episodes with him!).There are quite a few episodes set in China in this series too, which a probably my favourites - but I have to say they also contain some of the weakest acting and scripting - and why could Chinese actors not be found for Chinese parts?Don't expect too much from the extras. The series introduction says nothing, and is so short that you miss it if you blink, and Carradine in China is somewhat akin to watching someones home video of a holiday (which it is really). Most of it is spent complaining about the weather with one or two moments at the the temple of interest. The rest is pure self gratification on the part of Carradine and his mates on a lads trip to China. I have to confess I haven't bothered with commentaries.All in all the series is worth watching (and for completeness) but in some ways it is also a bit of a sad end to a serious that was innovative to start with.",3,OK but not as good as the early episodes,1125014400,"08 26, 2005",2005,2190,"['ideas', 'were', 'running', 'out', 'series', 'are', 'lots', 'duff', 'episodes', 'truly', 'ridiculous', 'story', 'lines', 'REALLY', 'poor', 'acting', 'still', 'fun', 'watch', 'One', 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'resurrected', 'previous', 'series', 'when', 'Cain', 'bit', 'odd', 'also', 'not', 'too', 'clear', 'how', 'messages', 'are', 'sent', 'received', 'various', 'nomadic', 'characters', 'who', 'hardly', 'have', 'PO', 'Box', 'collect', 'mail', 'good', 'fun', 'spotting', 'Camelot', 'sets', 'seem', 'even', 'more', 'obvious', 'here', 'before', 'sets', 'reused', 'series', 'different', 'places', 'mine', 'where', 'brother', 'cave', 'where', 'boys', 'are', 'held', 'hostage', 'are', 'identical', 'sets', 'Also', 'odd', 'quite', 'few', 'scenes', 'are', 'set', 'underground', 'caves', 'mines', 'rock', 'falls', 'etc', 'have', 'full', 'daylight', 'obvious', 'lighting', 'available.The', 'strangest', 'thing', 'DVD', 'set', 'episodes', 'are', 'wrong', 'order', 'presumably', 'studio', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'homeowrk', 'transmission', 'else', 'were', 'transmitted', 'very', 'strange', 'sequence', 'are', '3', 'episodes', 'leading', 'up', 'Full', 'Circle', 'obviously', 'meant', 'be', 'final', 'episode', 'then', '3', 'more', 'episodes', 'are', 'tagged', 'aftwards', 'one', 'set', 'China', 'two', 'Cain', 'apparently', 'lost', 'brother', 'again', 'having', 'just', 'spent', 'two', 'episodes', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'episodes', 'set', 'China', 'series', 'too', 'probably', 'favourites', 'have', 'say', 'also', 'contain', 'weakest', 'acting', 'scripting', 'why', 'could', 'Chinese', 'actors', 'not', 'be', 'found', 'Chinese', 'parts', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'extras', 'series', 'introduction', 'nothing', 'so', 'short', 'miss', 'blink', 'Carradine', 'China', 'somewhat', 'akin', 'watching', 'someones', 'home', 'video', 'holiday', 'really', 'Most', 'spent', 'complaining', 'weather', 'one', 'two', 'moments', 'temple', 'interest', 'rest', 'pure', 'self', 'gratification', 'part', 'Carradine', 'mates', 'lads', 'trip', 'China', 'have', 'confess', 'have', ""n't"", 'bothered', 'commentaries.All', 'series', 'worth', 'watching', 'completeness', 'ways', 'also', 'bit', 'sad', 'end', 'serious', 'was', 'innovative', 'start']",N/A

David Carradine unexpectedly walked out of the show at the end of this season, he's a man of many interests so he couldn't be tied down to the one show for too long. At least we have close to a hundred episodes of this tv classic as his legacy. These final episodes are:1. ""Cry of the Night Beast"" (Prod #166251) October 19, 1974 - Caine hears a baby buffalo crying (supernaturally) and stops a hunter from killing its mother. But when mother and baby get separated, Caine must find a way to keep the baby alive until he can reunite them. This is connected in flashbacks to a connection the young Caine felt with an unborn baby.2. ""My Brother, My Executioner"" (Prod #166252) October 12, 1974 - Caine tracks down Danny but doesn't get the kind of reception he expected from his brother. Soon thereafter a gunfighter arrives saying that this Danny Caine had been a very fast gunfighter with a different name just three years previously and he wants to see which one of them is faster.3. ""The Valley of Terror"" (Prod #166253) September 28, 1974 - When Caine learns a young woman has visions of the signs of the dragon and the tiger that are burnt on his arms, he rescues her from those who are trying to return her to an insane asylum.4.

The catch, according to the captain, is that Caine must allow the 'beheading' of the little finger of his right hand.5. ""The Predators"" (Prod #166255) October 5, 1974 - Caine needs a man to return with him as a witness to the fact that he didn't kill a sheriff. But the witness is one of a gang of hunters seeking Apache scalps and an Apache, who Caine has befriended, has had a vision to kill the whole gang.6. ""The Vanishing Image"" (Prod #166256) December 20, 1974 - Caine seeks out a dying photographer (Lew Ayres: nominated for an Emmy for the performance) who might be able to identify Danny in a group photograph.

""Blood of the Dragon"", Part I & 2 (Prod #166257-8) September 14, 1974 - Caine shows up in Gurneyville, on the California coast, knowing (supernaturally?) that his grandfather died there the night before. As Caine tracks down what happened to his grandfather, he is being tracked by three agents of The Imperial Guards of the Dragon Throne's Order of the Avenging Dragon which needs to kill Caine to end the shame of having failed to protect the Emperor's nephew (showing that the hunt for Caine won't end with the Emperor's death in 1875*1* - though, the Dowager Empress*1* might have continued anyway).8. ""The Demon God"" (Prod #166259) December 13, 1974 - In flashforwards Caine is stung by a scorpion and faces again a hallucination that he first experienced when, as a young student, he was poisoned by a Mandarin's son who wanted to learn from the temple student what awaited his dying father in the land of the dead.9. ""The Devil's Champion"" (Prod #166260) November 8, 1974 - In China a strange challenger shows up at the temple gates to challenge Master Kan to ritual combat to the death. Caine, who is having visions, must find out who or what is behind the situation.10. ""The Garments of Rage (Prod #166261) November 1, 1974 - After the events in ""The Demon God"" (#47 the last episode set in the present), Caine is left battered with his clothes torn, and he is taken in by railroad workers. The railroad is being harassed by a Shaolin master who has also fled China. This former teacher offers Caine clothes that had belonged to his nephew who died in a railroad accident. (At first Caine refuses to wear the clothes which might symbolize that he would help sabotage the railroad, but later Caine accepts the clothes and wears them for the rest of the series).11. ""Besieged"", Part 1: ""Death on Cold Mountain"" (Prod #166262) November 15, 1974 - In China Master Po and Caine are dispatched to rescue the survivors of another Shaolin temple which has been destroyed by the warlord Sing Lu Chan.

""A Lamb to the Slaughter"" (Prod #166264) January 11, 1975 - Caine goes to a village on the coast of Mexico to pay a debt the priest owes to a man whose father died saving his father. But the only payment the man will accept is for Caine to teach him fighting/killing skills.14. ""One Step to Darkness"" (Prod #166265) January 25, 1975 - Caine comes to the rescue of a woman and for his trouble is arrested by her army officer husband. The woman turns out to be addicted to a Chinese drug (opium?) and she introduces Caine to a mystical world where he meets a demon who claims the priest's life for a wish the very young Caine had made while sick with typhoid.15. ""The Thief of Chendo"" (Prod #166266) March 29, 1975 - Master Po and the young Caine visualize what it will be like when Caine leaves the temple. The two imagine (?) in a 'flashforward' (?) that Caine, now a priest, has been sent to help a duke. The young priest ""finds royalty everywhere"" as he runs into a prince of thieves who wants to help a princess.16. ""Battle Hymn"" (#166267) February 8, 1975 - While chasing Caine for the reward, a man falls from his horse and is killed. The useless death leads Caine to shaving his head. Then he undertakes to return the dead man's belongings including, it turns out, a treasure map to the man's wife in Sovalo. On the way he runs into a pair of traveling musicians who are going the same way.17. ""The Forbidden Kingdom"" (Prod #166268) January 18, 1975 - While fleeing the Imperial troops after killing the royal nephew, Caine tries to escape into Tibet. And in the process he is helped, betrayed and loved by Po Li. (She was the mother of the son who turns up in the sequel movie of 1986 ""Kung Fu: The Movie"".)18. ""The Last Raid"" (Prod # 166271) April 26, 1975 - On his way to Lordsville to answer a summons from Serenity Johnson (which he does in the following episode ""Ambush"" even though it seems ""Ambush"" was originally broadcast first), Caine visits old friends from ""The Well"" just as their son is kidnapped by former Confederate raiders who continue to fight the Civil War.19. ""Ambush"" (Prod #166272) April 4, 1975 - Serenity Johnson from ""Dark Angel"" & ""The Nature of Evil"" sends for Caine and then lies about how sick he is to get the priest to help him claim a $2000 debt.

""Barbary House"" (Prod #166269) February 15, 1975 - The poster from #58 ""Ambush"" leads Caine to an establishment outside San Francisco.

""Flight to Orion"" (Prod #166270) February 22, 1975 - Caine, Zeke and Zeke's mother try to find Danny before the search party which plans to find/kill him for a $10,000 reward (strange how both brothers turn out to have the same price on their heads).22.

When Caine and Danny take care of some bad guys, and Danny says, ""We're a really rough bunch, ain't we?"" it is funny and to see Caine laughing along with his brother is a dream come true for both Caine and the audience.

He was a little emotional but what kid at his age who went through what Zeke did would not be emotional? I think he played it right.

907109,A2LIA72DQFN9M0,B0009K7QZS,indijo,"[1, 1]","I really enjoyed this series when it was first aired in the 70s. I'm not much of a fan of either old westerns or martial arts, but this genre-bender series is a rare exception, as it puts a Kung Fu expert and Shaolin Priest up against the bad guys in the American old west. Not your typical western series, by a long shot. Caine is a very unique hero, one that opposes senseless killing and violence, but has the superior ability to defend himself and others against criminal violations and wrongful injustice like no other. Like Richard Kimble of ""The Fugitive"" series, he is also forever moving from town to town, avoiding the law because he is wanted by the Chinese government for murder of the emperor's nephew (who murdered his blind master), and also in search of his half-brother Danny Caine.In this season, there are also a few episodes that take place in China, flashing back to a time before Caine fled to America. One is about a conflict that the temple had with an evil Mandarin, another about a warlord that threatens to destroy the temple unless it surrenders a woman seeking sanctuary, and another about Caine's problems after he killed the emperor's nephew (for killing his blind Master Po).I couldn't resist purchasing both seasons 2 & 3 of this series when it was on sale, and I am relieved to report that, even though the dvds are double-sided, I have not had any problems with them. It may be that the quality is better than many other double-sided dvds because, rather than squeeze 4 hour-long episodes on one side, this dvd collection has only 3 episodes per side. Less compression could make all the difference with the digital quality.

907110,A366S12KCZ280V,B0009K7QZS,"Janet Chandler ""Music/Movie Lover""","[1, 1]","One of the most original western TV series of all times, the third season of Kung Fu would be the last season on air for the show. David Carradine by season 3 had enough of starring in the hit series and while the show was still one of the top shows on TV announced that the end of the third season he was leaving. It was certainly sad for all of us fans of Kung Fu to hear the news. But while I loved the show and rate it one of my all time favorite TV series the 3rd season was not I felt very good. I know there are some reviews that have been written praising the third season as the best but to me the final season lacks so much that the first two season had. The stories while for the most part are interesting (and there were some intriguing episodes to be sure. More on that in a minute) seem tired and rushed through in telling the stories. It doesn't feel like there was a lot of thought put into the story line. Also the series seemed to forget what the series was about. That being a man from the far east with his peaceful and meditative ways trying to adjust and understand the ways of western man who lives by the fist and gun. There were some episodes from the third season that delved into mysticism and demons that is just too far out there to be interesting to me. It felt like the show lost its way during the last season. Maybe part of it generated from Davids' lack of interest in the show and desires to move on to other projects he did have interest in.That in no way implies there was no good episodes or stories because there was. There was also some creative ideas that was put into some of the story lines. Probably the most interesting of all the episodes in the 3rd season was ""The Demon God"" that takes place in China with Caine when he was still a student at the monastery. In it a Prince poisons young Student Caine to understand better how it is to die. As young Caine is feeling the effects of the poison he has flash forwards to a time as he is wondering around the American west as an adult and is stung by a scorpion. Very clever premise since one of the main features of the show is the flashbacks Caine would always have remembering life back at the Shaolin monastery. Also interesting about this episode is the fact David Carradine directed this episode. David had wanted to try his hand at directing and ended up directing three episodes during the last season. In addition to ""Demon God"" he also directed ""Besieged"" both parts 1 and 2. ""Besieged"" was also a story that takes place entirely in China. All in all I think David Carradine showed in these three episodes that he had a real knack for directing and I do consider these 3 stories among the best from the final season.The main story line in the final season is Caine's search for his brother. It actually is a four part series where Caine not only finds his brother but his nephew. Considering a large part of the series was about Caines' search for his lost family members it was fitting in ending the show that they closed it with the brothers finding each other. Maybe the best story from the boxed set is ""The Last Raid"" in which Caine visits the black family he befriended from the first episode in season 2 ""The Well"". In the episode the son, Daniel, and his friend are kidnapped by a Confederate raider who is seeking revenge against the father of the friend of Daniel. Caine, Amos (Daniel's father) and the father of Daniel's friend have to race against time to try to save the boys lives. It is this episode that remeinds me of what the show was like during the first two seasons.The third season certainly did not lack for big named stars who appeared on the shows. Way too many to mention all but among them are William Shatner, Leslie Nielsen, Patricia Neal, Eddie and Edward Albert, Barbara Hershey, Jose Feliciano, Julius ""Cannonball"" Adderly and playing for the last time as ""Serenity Johnson"" John Carradine. Of course Keye Luke, Philip Ahn and Radames Pera are also here for the last season as well.Make no mistake I don't think season 3 of ""Kung Fu"" was bad, just not the best and because of that a little disappointing. Whether you agree with my assesment of this season or think it was the best of the 3 seasons if you are a fan of the series you got to get this boxed set to complete you ""Kung Fu"" collection. Now if they would only bring out on DVD David Carradines other series ""Kung Fu: The Legend Continues"". It is way past due to be released!",3,Not A Typical Western Season 3,1352505600,"11 10, 2012",2012,4469,"['One', 'most', 'original', 'western', 'TV', 'series', 'times', 'third', 'season', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'would', 'be', 'last', 'season', 'air', 'show', 'David', 'Carradine', 'season', '3', 'had', 'enough', 'starring', 'hit', 'series', 'show', 'was', 'still', 'one', 'top', 'shows', 'TV', 'announced', 'end', 'third', 'season', 'was', 'leaving', 'was', 'certainly', 'sad', 'fans', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'hear', 'news', 'loved', 'show', 'rate', 'one', 'time', 'favorite', 'TV', 'series', '3rd', 'season', 'was', 'not', 'felt', 'very', 'good', 'know', 'are', 'reviews', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'praising', 'third', 'season', 'best', 'final', 'season', 'so', 'much', 'first', 'two', 'season', 'had', 'stories', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'interesting', 'were', 'intriguing', 'episodes', 'be', 'sure', 'More', 'minute', 'seem', 'tired', 'rushed', 'telling', 'stories', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'lot', 'thought', 'put', 'story', 'line', 'Also', 'series', 'seemed', 'forget', 'what', 'series', 'was', 'about', 'being', 'man', 'far', 'east', 'peaceful', 'meditative', 'ways', 'trying', 'adjust', 'understand', 'ways', 'western', 'man', 'who', 'fist', 'gun', 'were', 'episodes', 'third', 'season', 'delved', 'mysticism', 'demons', 'just', 'too', 'far', 'out', 'there', 'be', 'interesting', 'felt', 'show', 'lost', 'way', 'last', 'season', 'Maybe', 'part', 'generated', 'Davids', 'lack', 'interest', 'show', 'move', 'other', 'projects', 'did', 'have', 'interest', 'in.That', 'way', 'was', 'good', 'episodes', 'stories', 'was', 'was', 'also', 'creative', 'ideas', 'was', 'put', 'story', 'lines', 'Probably', 'most', 'interesting', 'episodes', '3rd', 'season', 'was', 'Demon', 'God', 'place', 'China', 'Caine', 'when', 'was', 'still', 'student', 'monastery', 'Prince', 'poisons', 'young', 'Student', 'Caine', 'understand', 'better', 'how', 'die', 'young', 'Caine', 'feeling', 'effects', 'poison', 'flash', 'forwards', 'time', 'wondering', 'American', 'west', 'adult', 'stung', 'scorpion', 'Very', 'clever', 'premise', 'one', 'main', 'features', 'show', 'flashbacks', 'Caine', 'would', 'always', 'have', 'remembering', 'life', 'back', 'Shaolin', 'monastery', 'Also', 'interesting', 'episode', 'fact', 'David', 'Carradine', 'directed', 'episode', 'David', 'had', 'wanted', 'try', 'hand', 'directing', 'ended', 'up', 'directing', 'three', 'episodes', 'last', 'season', 'addition', 'Demon', 'God', 'also', 'directed', 'Besieged', 'parts', '1', '2', 'Besieged', 'was', 'also', 'story', 'place', 'entirely', 'China', 'think', 'David', 'Carradine', 'showed', 'three', 'episodes', 'had', 'real', 'knack', 'directing', 'do', 'consider', '3', 'stories', 'best', 'final', 'season.The', 'main', 'story', 'line', 'final', 'season', 'Caine', 'search', 'brother', 'actually', 'four', 'part', 'series', 'where', 'Caine', 'not', 'only', 'brother', 'nephew', 'Considering', 'large', 'part', 'series', 'was', 'Caines', 'search', 'lost', 'family', 'members', 'was', 'fitting', 'ending', 'show', 'closed', 'brothers', 'finding', 'other', 'Maybe', 'best', 'story', 'boxed', 'set', 'Last', 'Raid', 'Caine', 'black', 'family', 'befriended', 'first', 'episode', 'season', '2', 'Well', 'episode', 'son', 'Daniel', 'friend', 'are', 'kidnapped', 'Confederate', 'raider', 'who', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'father', 'friend', 'Daniel', 'Caine', 'Amos', 'Daniel', 'father', 'father', 'Daniel', 'friend', 'have', 'race', 'time', 'try', 'save', 'boys', 'lives', 'episode', 'what', 'show', 'was', 'first', 'two', 'seasons.The', 'third', 'season', 'certainly', 'did', 'not', 'lack', 'big', 'named', 'stars', 'who', 'appeared', 'shows', 'Way', 'too', 'many', 'mention', 'are', 'William', 'Shatner', 'Leslie', 'Nielsen', 'Patricia', 'Neal', 'Eddie', 'Edward', 'Albert', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'Jose', 'Feliciano', 'Julius', 'Cannonball', 'Adderly', 'playing', 'last', 'time', 'Serenity', 'Johnson', 'John', 'Carradine', 'course', 'Keye', 'Luke', 'Philip', 'Ahn', 'Radames', 'Pera', 'are', 'also', 'here', 'last', 'season', 'well.Make', 'mistake', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'season', '3', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'was', 'bad', 'just', 'not', 'best', 'little', 'disappointing', 'agree', 'assesment', 'season', 'think', 'was', 'best', '3', 'seasons', 'are', 'fan', 'series', 'got', 'get', 'boxed', 'set', 'complete', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'collection', 'Now', 'would', 'only', 'bring', 'out', 'DVD', 'David', 'Carradines', 'other', 'series', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Legend', 'Continues', 'way', 'past', 'due', 'be', 'released']",N/A

Now, however, I remember why I forgot most of these episodes of the third season - because they were not that good.  It wasn't David Carradine (although one would hope the martial arts would get a little better, it doesn't), but the show suffers from sophist postulations and corny dialogue.The worst of the stories is when Cain finally finds his brother and his nephew.  These stories lack creativity and zeal and the only good thing is that Cain must for once compromise and ride a horse (the best scene in this four episode stretch).  The actor playing the nephew Ziek is just horrible, but it may not be the actors fault; after all, the script is just awful.

And the screen also seems to have been cropped too. But overall, I guess it's better to have them in this format and versions than not at all. But that's why the three-star rating.The third season's episodes are notable for the appearances of Eddie Albert, Patricia Neal, Barbara Hershey, William Shatner, Leslie Nielsen, and John Carradine. I don't recall which season it was, but one of my favorite guest actors was Andrew Prine, who had a major role in the science-fiction series ""V."" I also read once he had classical Shakespearean drama training. He certainly had great poise.A brief comment on the martial arts, since I am a teacher of kung fu and also karate. A judo instructor, oddly enough, was the first expert engaged to advise on the martial arts for the show. At some point, someone apparently said shouldn't we get a kung fu expert since that's what the show is about? And so they retained Los Angeles sifu Kam Yuen, a master of the very interesting tai mantis style of kung fu, which is an offshoot of the original northern praying mantis style and considered a very sophisticated system.There are actually dozens of different praying mantis styles at this point, including six harmonies mantis, plum flower mantis, shiny board mantis, 7 star praying mantis, and southern mantis, although the latter probably isn't a true praying mantis sytem.So it was interesting that a master of one of the rarer kung fu styles in this country was chosen, rather than something more common such as Wing Chun, Hung Gar, Choy Li Fut, or 7 Star Praying mantis, all of which are more common styles. But whatever style was chosen, the show introduced millions of people to kung fu in a way that was technically accurate and faithful to the original style.Also, Keye Luke, who played the old temple master, is actually a tai chi practitioner rather than kung fu, although some tai chi styles, such as the Chen family style, are much more martial and kung fu like, as compared to say, the more common Yang or Wu tai chi styles.",3,A note on the history,1134259200,"12 11, 2005",2005,2203,"['previous', 'reviewer', 'have', 'problem', 'episodes', 'having', 'been', 'shortened', 'few', 'minutes', 'make', 'room', 'more', 'commercials', 'story', 'choppier', 'screen', 'also', 'have', 'been', 'cropped', 'too', 'overall', 'guess', 'better', 'have', 'format', 'versions', 'not', 'why', 'three-star', 'rating.The', 'third', 'season', 'episodes', 'are', 'notable', 'appearances', 'Eddie', 'Albert', 'Patricia', 'Neal', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'William', 'Shatner', 'Leslie', 'Nielsen', 'John', 'Carradine', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'season', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'guest', 'actors', 'was', 'Andrew', 'Prine', 'who', 'had', 'major', 'role', 'science-fiction', 'series', 'V.', 'also', 'read', 'once', 'had', 'classical', 'Shakespearean', 'drama', 'training', 'certainly', 'had', 'great', 'poise.A', 'brief', 'comment', 'martial', 'arts', 'am', 'teacher', 'kung', 'fu', 'also', 'karate', 'judo', 'instructor', 'oddly', 'enough', 'was', 'first', 'expert', 'engaged', 'advise', 'martial', 'arts', 'show', 'point', 'someone', 'apparently', 'said', 'should', ""n't"", 'get', 'kung', 'fu', 'expert', 'what', 'show', 'so', 'retained', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'sifu', 'Kam', 'Yuen', 'master', 'very', 'interesting', 'tai', 'mantis', 'style', 'kung', 'fu', 'offshoot', 'original', 'northern', 'praying', 'mantis', 'style', 'considered', 'very', 'sophisticated', 'system.There', 'are', 'actually', 'dozens', 'different', 'praying', 'mantis', 'styles', 'point', 'including', 'six', 'harmonies', 'mantis', 'plum', 'flower', 'mantis', 'shiny', 'board', 'mantis', '7', 'star', 'praying', 'mantis', 'southern', 'mantis', 'latter', 'probably', ""n't"", 'true', 'praying', 'mantis', 'sytem.So', 'was', 'interesting', 'master', 'one', 'rarer', 'kung', 'fu', 'styles', 'country', 'was', 'chosen', 'rather', 'something', 'more', 'common', 'such', 'Wing', 'Chun', 'Hung', 'Gar', 'Choy', 'Li', 'Fut', '7', 'Star', 'Praying', 'mantis', 'are', 'more', 'common', 'styles', 'style', 'was', 'chosen', 'show', 'introduced', 'millions', 'people', 'kung', 'fu', 'way', 'was', 'technically', 'accurate', 'faithful', 'original', 'style.Also', 'Keye', 'Luke', 'who', 'played', 'old', 'temple', 'master', 'actually', 'tai', 'chi', 'practitioner', 'rather', 'kung', 'fu', 'tai', 'chi', 'styles', 'such', 'Chen', 'family', 'style', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'martial', 'kung', 'fu', 'like', 'compared', 'say', 'more', 'common', 'Yang', 'Wu', 'tai', 'chi', 'styles']",N/A

907119,A1FC39ADY163L,B0009K7QZS,Robert Payne,"[9, 11]","The quality of ""Kung Fu's"" third season does not match the excellence of the first two.  To me, the show's writers appeared to be stumped for fresh ideas.  And in trying to revitalize the series, its creators regrettably settled for an easy solution.Among the many things that I like about ""Kung Fu's"" first two seasons, one was their refusal to fall back on the shopworn idea of Asia as a magical place, an other-worldly realm where Western physical realities need not apply.  To me, this clich&eacute;d idea of ""magical and incomprehensible Asia"" implies that Asian people are inherently different from the rest of the human species.  Examples of this stereotype include ""The Shadow's"" Lamont Cranston learning his powers of invisibility from ""the mysterious East"" and ""Freaky Friday's"" mother and daughter switching bodies over a Chinese fortune cookie.  In fact, ""Kung Fu's"" second-season episode ""The Brujo"" seems like an explicit debunking of magic and superstition.However, the first episode of the third season introduces the character of a Tibetan mystic (Clyde Kusatsu) sent by the Chinese authorities to capture Caine.  The episode, ""Blood of the Dragon,"" is replete with such physical impossibilities as a magically appearing tent and a magically conjured doppelganger of Caine, supernatural story elements previously uncharacteristic of the series.  Other paranormal third-season storylines include Caine confronting a demon with magical powers (""One Step to Darkness"") and Grasshopper's poison-induced ""flash-forward"" to his adulthood in the U.S. and his battle with a Native American deity (""The Demon God"").Although the third season also inaugurated the more agreeable idea of setting a few episodes in China before Caine left, the writing wasn't as crisp as it had been before, and some contrived storylines made the erstwhile pacifist Caine easier to goad into a fight.As much as I mourned ""Kung Fu's"" cancellation in 1975, perhaps the show had run out of steam by then.  Also, I have trouble putting into words just how appalling I thought the updated series ""Kung Fu: The Legend Continues"" (1992-98) was.  This cheesy and uninspired knock-off about a descendant of Kwai-Chang Caine (also played by David Carradine) in 20th-century urban America was utterly unworthy of its predecessor, suggesting to me the depths to which the original show might have sunk if it hadn't been cancelled when it was.I was sad to see the original ""Kung Fu"" wander off into the sunset.  But I'm glad the show left me with fond memories.(Note: I have also written reviews for the first and second seasons of ""Kung Fu."")",3,Pt. 3: Third-Season Decline,1173139200,"03 6, 2007",2007,2617,"['quality', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'third', 'season', 'not', 'match', 'excellence', 'first', 'two', 'show', 'writers', 'appeared', 'be', 'stumped', 'fresh', 'ideas', 'trying', 'revitalize', 'series', 'creators', 'regrettably', 'settled', 'easy', 'solution.Among', 'many', 'things', 'like', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'one', 'was', 'refusal', 'fall', 'back', 'shopworn', 'idea', 'Asia', 'magical', 'place', 'other-worldly', 'realm', 'where', 'Western', 'physical', 'realities', 'need', 'not', 'apply', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'idea', 'magical', 'incomprehensible', 'Asia', 'Asian', 'people', 'are', 'inherently', 'different', 'rest', 'human', 'species', 'Examples', 'stereotype', 'include', 'Shadow', 'Lamont', 'Cranston', 'learning', 'powers', 'invisibility', 'mysterious', 'East', 'Freaky', 'Friday', 'mother', 'daughter', 'switching', 'bodies', 'Chinese', 'fortune', 'cookie', 'fact', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'second-season', 'episode', 'Brujo', 'explicit', 'debunking', 'magic', 'superstition.However', 'first', 'episode', 'third', 'season', 'character', 'Tibetan', 'mystic', 'Clyde', 'Kusatsu', 'sent', 'Chinese', 'authorities', 'capture', 'Caine', 'episode', 'Blood', 'Dragon', 'replete', 'such', 'physical', 'impossibilities', 'magically', 'appearing', 'tent', 'magically', 'conjured', 'doppelganger', 'Caine', 'supernatural', 'story', 'elements', 'previously', 'uncharacteristic', 'series', 'Other', 'paranormal', 'third-season', 'storylines', 'include', 'Caine', 'confronting', 'demon', 'magical', 'powers', 'One', 'Step', 'Darkness', 'Grasshopper', 'poison-induced', 'flash-forward', 'adulthood', 'U.S.', 'battle', 'Native', 'American', 'deity', 'Demon', 'God', 'third', 'season', 'also', 'inaugurated', 'more', 'agreeable', 'idea', 'setting', 'few', 'episodes', 'China', 'Caine', 'left', 'writing', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'crisp', 'had', 'been', 'before', 'contrived', 'storylines', 'made', 'erstwhile', 'pacifist', 'Caine', 'easier', 'goad', 'fight.As', 'much', 'mourned', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'cancellation', '1975', 'perhaps', 'show', 'had', 'run', 'steam', 'then', 'Also', 'have', 'trouble', 'putting', 'words', 'just', 'how', 'appalling', 'thought', 'updated', 'series', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Legend', 'Continues', '1992-98', 'was', 'cheesy', 'uninspired', 'knock-off', 'descendant', 'Kwai-Chang', 'Caine', 'also', 'played', 'David', 'Carradine', '20th-century', 'urban', 'America', 'was', 'utterly', 'unworthy', 'predecessor', 'suggesting', 'depths', 'original', 'show', 'might', 'have', 'sunk', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'cancelled', 'when', 'was.I', 'was', 'sad', 'see', 'original', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'wander', 'sunset', ""'m"", 'glad', 'show', 'left', 'fond', 'memories', 'Note', 'have', 'also', 'written', 'first', 'second', 'seasons', 'Kung', 'Fu']",N/A

David Carradine walked off the set of the final episode of the 3rd season of ""Kung Fu"" and elected not to return for a variety of reasons. The series acted as a spring board for Carradine boosting him to roles such as Woody Gutherie in ""Bound for Glory"". This the third season of the series (and the last for the original series...we won't talk about the bad sequel series Carradine starred in during the 90's) allowed a sense of closure; Caine discovers the whereabouts of his half brother and is able to move into a new phase of his life during the last season.Another excellent series of transfers from Warner Home Video demonstrates why Warner continues to set the pace when it comes to major studios releasing TV shows on DVD. Unlike many releases from the 1970's, ""Kung Fu"" actually comes with extras that are worthwhile and has a superior transfer from new high def sources. There are specks here and there and dirt embedded in the original opening titles but aside from that the show looks extremely good. Just a note this is a reissue of the previous 3rd season set NOT a new transfer.There are occasional analog artifacts that probably occurred on the original negative or during the initial duping process otherwise the image quality of this terrific transfer. Not surprisingly most of the analog artifacts like dirt and hair are visible during the title sequence which was duplicated quite a few times. Likewise most of the issues with grain, color shift and other issues are during the title sequence. Colors are bright and vivid with the image quality being sharp for the most part. Occasionally the image does soften a bit but, on the whole, this is a superb job from Warner. As many fans of the series are aware Warner initially released the first season of ""Kung Fu"" in a 1.78:1 aspect ratio increasing the image are at the sides at the lopping off the images at the top and bottom. This was done to make the series compatible with 16x9 TVs. Fans let Warner know they weren't happy and Warner returned the series to its proper aspect ratio. The third season, like the second, is presented in the full screen 1.33:1 aspect ratio that it was broadcast in during the 70's. I don't recall the original run of the series so can't speak to whether or not any of these are syndicated versions but of the episodes I've watched and their length, makes it appear that these are the original broadcast versions.The last season includes an excellent documentary on Carradine's return visit to China during the preparation for his participation in the boxed set DVD releases. His first visit was during the run of the TV series and this return visit provides a fascinating travelogue. Carradine goes with two of his friends Rob Moses (Carradine's Kung Fu trainer and a designer of marital arts weapons) and Jay Habakangas to the Emperor's Summer palace, visits a number of temples and Pagodas. They take the traditional tourist approach boarding buses, trams, etc. and get a taste of regal China. My favorite part (although it's not his) is when Rob Moses shows off some martial arts moves on a bridge in China during winter. He manages to pull a hamstring because he doesn't warm like he usually does. They continue their travels to the Shoalin Monastery in a remote part of China.The late David Carradine provides two commentary tracks full of trivia for two episodes providing trivia about each episode. I was greatly surprised at how well he recalled the making of various episodes.Once again a top notch release from Warner Home Video. ""Kung Fu: Season 3"" features two commentary tracks by David Carradine, a documentary showcasing his return visit to China and features top notch transfers for each original broadcast length episode.
