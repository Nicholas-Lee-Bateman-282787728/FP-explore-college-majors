This series is almost cerebral in the approach it takes to developing it's themes. But it certainly isn't boring. Great characters, with better than average artwork and animation. The CGI especially deserves a good study by students of the animated arts. What is amazing to me though is the  writing, There were so many places that this series could have jumped the shark with smaltz. Sometimes it toes the line, but ultimately there becomes this melding of sweetness and toughness in many of the characters that becomes satisfying in the end. Give Kurau a watch.

1216388,A1AQ477HH3KQ8P,B001M6SHBU,RavenRing,"[8, 16]","When she was 12 years old, Amami Kurau was involved in an accident in her father's lab on the Moon, that left her alive, but not herself. Kurau's body is now the home to an energy entity called Rynax. In order to protect her, Kurau's father sends her to Earth and claims that she died. Ten years later, Kurau is working as an elite mercenary, and is the creme de la creme of the crop. But Rynax are paired creatures, and Kurau's Rynax has been alone for a long time. Finally, after ten years of waiting, her partner is born - unfortunately for the two of them, Kurau's existence has been leaked to the government and now they are intent on hunting her down.I watched this series because a friend of mine owned it. I read the description and thought ""Hey cool, a sci-fi mystery anime"" and agreed to watch it with him. In the beginning I enjoyed it a little, the mystery of the Rynax was interesting and seemed promising. But as the series progressed I realized with horror that it wasn't science fiction, it was a light yuri. While not a yuri fan, I could have put up with yuri in a Sci-Fi story, but I didn't want a yuri story with Sci-Fi elements. (Note: Yuri = girl-to-girl love)  I knew after the second disc that I didn't like this series, but I kept watching because I was curious. It wasn't worth it.Christmas (Kurau's partner), looks to be about 14 and Kurau is 22. Fortunately, there is no physical contact between them besides lots of hugging, but their obsession with each other was downright annoying. Looking at it as a pair of bonded aliens makes it seem cool, until you are subjected to countless scenes of ""Christmas!"" ""Kurau!""""Christmas!""""Kurau!"" (repeat x100), that you just feel bored.I just couldn't stand this series because the relationship between Kurau and Christmas annoyed the h*** outta me. Also, the characters themselves were really annoying. Kurau and Chirstmas didn't seem to exist outside of their relationship. I wasn't the only one who was annoyed either. I watched this with a guy friend and two sisters, and all of us hated it. The Sci-Fi elements are cool, there just isn't enough focus on them. The ending was well balanced. But there are many more much better series out there, don't waste your time with this one. If you want Sci-Fi, tryHeroic Age,Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,Darker Than Black, orErgo Proxy.PS If you found this review unhelpful, could you please leave a short comment explaining why?

1216389,AFV2584U13XP3,B001M6SHBU,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),"[1, 1]","If I had to place the animation, storyline,  and overall plot of the series I feel it would be a mix of Ghost In The Shell and Eureka7 and while on whole the series turned out be enjoyable it will get confusing in some areas unless you listen and watch the scenes very closely.  The amazon editorial will probably give the best basic information of the series because if you tried to really explain the series in detail it would probably take two to three pages at most.  The animation of the series as well as the soundtrack also seems to be a mix of GITS and Eureka7 though with the animation I felt it fell more to the side of GITS design animation.  The video is standard only I saw a few advertisements saying this was widescreen, sadly that's false but overall the clarity of the video is still very good,  also the voice cast picked for both the Japanese subbed and English dubbed did their character roles well with little complaints on either end.  While the series will have some fight/action scenes the series overall isn't an action/mecha series as more a journey of possibilities for our characters seemingly trapped in their situation trying to find the most hopeful solution to their problem.  All I can say is check a few episodes online to be positive this is a series you want as it definitely won't be for everyone but I'm sure once you give it a try you might be shocked at how enjoyable you find the series...",5,Entertaining But Somewhat Confusing Sci-Fi Series,1316217600,"09 17, 2011",2011,1430,"['had', 'place', 'animation', 'storyline', 'overall', 'plot', 'series', 'feel', 'would', 'be', 'mix', 'Ghost', 'Shell', 'Eureka7', 'whole', 'series', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'will', 'get', 'confusing', 'areas', 'listen', 'watch', 'scenes', 'very', 'closely', 'amazon', 'editorial', 'will', 'probably', 'give', 'best', 'basic', 'information', 'series', 'tried', 'really', 'explain', 'series', 'detail', 'would', 'probably', 'take', 'two', 'three', 'pages', 'most', 'animation', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'soundtrack', 'also', 'be', 'mix', 'GITS', 'Eureka7', 'animation', 'felt', 'fell', 'more', 'side', 'GITS', 'design', 'animation', 'video', 'standard', 'only', 'saw', 'few', 'advertisements', 'saying', 'was', 'widescreen', 'sadly', 'false', 'overall', 'clarity', 'video', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'also', 'voice', 'cast', 'picked', 'Japanese', 'subbed', 'English', 'dubbed', 'did', 'character', 'roles', 'well', 'little', 'complaints', 'end', 'series', 'will', 'have', 'fight/action', 'scenes', 'series', 'overall', ""n't"", 'action/mecha', 'series', 'more', 'journey', 'possibilities', 'characters', 'seemingly', 'trapped', 'situation', 'trying', 'find', 'most', 'hopeful', 'solution', 'problem', 'can', 'say', 'check', 'few', 'episodes', 'online', 'be', 'positive', 'series', 'want', 'definitely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'everyone', ""'m"", 'sure', 'give', 'try', 'might', 'be', 'shocked', 'how', 'enjoyable', 'find', 'series']",Kurau Phantom Memory: Complete
1216390,AS77LVLUSX18R,B001M6SHBU,Roy Basilisk,"[5, 5]","As an affecting sci-fi action-drama with a strong emphasis on the importance of family and friends, Kurau: Phantom Memory has slowly developed into a sleeper favorite over the years.This latest ""S.A.V.E."" release contains all 24 episodes with a solid English dub in 5.1 surround (and Japanese stereo), spread across 4 discs with some extras such as clean openings.  Importantly, the jarring lime-green S.A.V.E. banner can be dispensed with simply by reversing the cover art.  The reverse features a complete title on the spine and looks just like the initial cover art minus the banner.  The discs themselves feature nice printed art of individual characters. In order of discs: Kurau, Doug, Christmas, and Ayaka Steiger.These characters represent the strongest elements of Kurau: Phantom Memory.  Be it the deeply bonded sisterhood of Kurau and the entity she names ""Christmas"" that is at the center of the series (Kurau sharing an existence with an internal ""Rynax"" energy being, and Christmas a complex being that is part-clone/part-alien ""Rynax"" externally nurtured by Kurau); to the unassuming competence and support of agent-for-hire Doug; or how antagonist Ayaka Steiger deals with a famous last name and tragic past.Also interesting is the mix of locations and settings as government forces seek out Kurau and Christmas due to their Rynax background and powers. Intriguingly, both Kurau and Ayaka come from what were pointedly happy mixed-race families that also both happened to be torn by tragedy.  This becomes more than trivial when much of the series later shifts to the Swiss countryside, home to Kurau's family on her mother's side (her father Dr. Amami who oversaw the experiment which resulted in Kurau's accidental Rynax cohabitation tries to help from a necessary distance).For her part, Ayaka is a lead government agent tasked with finding Kurau and Christmas--but also fixated on discovering what happened to her family in a tragic event, especially in light of her widely-respected father John Steiger, whose name carries great weight in government circles even a dozen years after his death.  And in yet another point of commonality with Kurau, for her own reasons she also never has the word ""Christmas"" far from mind.Another important part of the mix that acts as a supportive catalyst to other characters is Doug.  Eventually helping Kurau and Christmas, he also happens to have been Ayaka's superior when in government service.  Recently divorced but always very close to his son Ted, he initially starts off at a distance, hired by someone to keep an eye on Kurau.All of this is presented with what appears to be a very clean transfer of 6 episodes per disc, and with the aforementioned 5.1 surround English audio featuring solid to excellent performances led by Monica Rial as Kurau.  Kurau: Phantom Memory comes highly recommended to those who enjoy mature sci-fi anime.",5,A unique blend of powerful emotion and sci-fi action,1325462400,"01 2, 2012",2012,2900,"['affecting', 'sci-fi', 'action-drama', 'strong', 'emphasis', 'importance', 'family', 'friends', 'Kurau', 'Phantom', 'Memory', 'slowly', 'developed', 'sleeper', 'favorite', 'years.This', 'latest', 'S.A.V.E', 'release', '24', 'episodes', 'solid', 'English', 'dub', '5.1', 'surround', 'Japanese', 'stereo', 'spread', '4', 'discs', 'extras', 'such', 'clean', 'openings', 'Importantly', 'jarring', 'lime-green', 'S.A.V.E', 'banner', 'can', 'be', 'dispensed', 'simply', 'reversing', 'cover', 'art', 'reverse', 'complete', 'title', 'spine', 'just', 'initial', 'cover', 'art', 'banner', 'discs', 'feature', 'nice', 'printed', 'art', 'individual', 'characters', 'order', 'discs', 'Kurau', 'Doug', 'Christmas', 'Ayaka', 'Steiger.These', 'characters', 'represent', 'strongest', 'elements', 'Kurau', 'Phantom', 'Memory', 'Be', 'deeply', 'bonded', 'sisterhood', 'Kurau', 'entity', 'Christmas', 'center', 'series', 'Kurau', 'sharing', 'existence', 'internal', 'Rynax', 'energy', 'being', 'Christmas', 'complex', 'being', 'part-clone/part-alien', 'Rynax', 'externally', 'nurtured', 'Kurau', 'unassuming', 'competence', 'support', 'agent-for-hire', 'Doug', 'how', 'antagonist', 'Ayaka', 'Steiger', 'deals', 'famous', 'last', 'name', 'tragic', 'past.Also', 'interesting', 'mix', 'locations', 'settings', 'government', 'forces', 'seek', 'out', 'Kurau', 'Christmas', 'due', 'Rynax', 'background', 'powers', 'Intriguingly', 'Kurau', 'Ayaka', 'come', 'what', 'were', 'pointedly', 'happy', 'mixed-race', 'families', 'also', 'happened', 'be', 'torn', 'tragedy', 'more', 'trivial', 'when', 'much', 'series', 'later', 'shifts', 'Swiss', 'countryside', 'home', 'Kurau', 'family', 'mother', 'side', 'father', 'Dr.', 'Amami', 'who', 'oversaw', 'experiment', 'resulted', 'Kurau', 'accidental', 'Rynax', 'cohabitation', 'tries', 'help', 'necessary', 'distance', 'part', 'Ayaka', 'lead', 'government', 'agent', 'tasked', 'finding', 'Kurau', 'Christmas', 'also', 'fixated', 'discovering', 'what', 'happened', 'family', 'tragic', 'event', 'especially', 'light', 'widely-respected', 'father', 'John', 'Steiger', 'name', 'great', 'weight', 'government', 'circles', 'even', 'dozen', 'years', 'death', 'yet', 'point', 'commonality', 'Kurau', 'own', 'reasons', 'also', 'never', 'word', 'Christmas', 'far', 'mind.Another', 'important', 'part', 'mix', 'supportive', 'catalyst', 'other', 'characters', 'Doug', 'Eventually', 'helping', 'Kurau', 'Christmas', 'also', 'have', 'been', 'Ayaka', 'superior', 'when', 'government', 'service', 'Recently', 'divorced', 'always', 'very', 'close', 'son', 'Ted', 'initially', 'off', 'distance', 'hired', 'someone', 'keep', 'eye', 'Kurau.All', 'presented', 'what', 'be', 'very', 'clean', 'transfer', '6', 'episodes', 'disc', 'aforementioned', '5.1', 'surround', 'English', 'audio', 'featuring', 'solid', 'excellent', 'performances', 'led', 'Monica', 'Rial', 'Kurau', 'Kurau', 'Phantom', 'Memory', 'highly', 'recommended', 'who', 'enjoy', 'mature', 'sci-fi', 'anime']",Kurau Phantom Memory: Complete

However, I felt that the pace was just too sluggish, despite there being plenty of action. It is really hard to say why exactly this anime failed to captivate me. Perhaps the characters were a bit too... simplistic? Like they were given one role and only one throughout the entire film. Even though certain opinions changed they still seemed stuck in the same role.Also, I contest the 'yuri' claims for this film. I am strictly opposed to yaoi/yuri content but I didn't get any yuri vibes from this anime. In fact, it was told right near the start that the relationship of Kurau and Christmas will be as sisters and to me that's all it seemed like they were - close sisters.I have seen worse anime than this. I don't think I wasted my time finishing it.
