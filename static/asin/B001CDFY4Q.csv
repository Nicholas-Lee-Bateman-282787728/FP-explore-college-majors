1175896,A1KB2VS9JTCTHQ,B001CDFY4Q,Bug DeLug,"[1, 2]","I am a big fan of Kevin Smith's work. His films, for the best part, have been highly entertaining and hilarious. I also really enjoyed Kevin's My Boring [...] Life book and his subsequent live shows. More to the point though- I am a fan of Kevin's Smodcast, which for those that don't know is a free podcast and is now nearly 100 episodes old. With each episode being roughly an hour long, that is a helluva lot of Kevin. And therein lies the problem- A lot of these anecdotes have already been told, both on that show and in blogs. With Kevin now releasing a new book, culled from the best bits of Smodcast. That means that you may well have heard some of these stories up to four times including this DVD. First Kevin tells an anecdote about his dogs which goes on for the best part of an hour. That's right- THE BEST PART OF AN HOUR. And to be honest, it really wasn't that funny- oh, and he'd already done it on the aforementioned Smodcast.See, the biggest problem for me here is that the Q and A portion of the show is basically non-existent now. Barely any questions from the audience get a straight response. Instead what Kevin does is twist it in order to do another pre-prepared piece. Why he doesn't just tell the audience to sit down I don't know. The majority of those lining up to ask a question were stood up for HOURS. And they still didn't get their questions answered.There is some good stuff here, mostly on the second disc. The Bruce Willis bit is very interesting, though it is taken nearly word-for-word from Kevin's book My Boring [...] Life, which took the story directly from one of Kevin's previous blogs. It just makes me wonder what happened to Kevin somewhat fiercely attacking some of those big Hollywood names? This isn't dreadful, and if you have never heard Smodcast or read any of this guy's blogs, you will be highly amused, in parts. But for the rest of us- well, maybe Kevin just need to shut up for a little bit.",3,"Okay, But I've Heard It All Before",1253664000,"09 23, 2009",2009,1949,"['am', 'big', 'fan', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'work', 'films', 'best', 'part', 'have', 'been', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'hilarious', 'also', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Kevin', 'My', 'Boring', '[', ']', 'Life', 'book', 'subsequent', 'live', 'shows', 'More', 'point', 'though-', 'am', 'fan', 'Kevin', 'Smodcast', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'free', 'podcast', 'now', 'nearly', '100', 'episodes', 'old', 'episode', 'being', 'roughly', 'hour', 'long', 'helluva', 'lot', 'Kevin', 'therein', 'problem-', 'lot', 'anecdotes', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'told', 'show', 'blogs', 'Kevin', 'now', 'releasing', 'new', 'book', 'culled', 'best', 'bits', 'Smodcast', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'heard', 'stories', 'up', 'four', 'times', 'including', 'DVD', 'First', 'Kevin', 'anecdote', 'dogs', 'best', 'part', 'hour', 'right-', 'THE', 'BEST', 'PART', 'AN', 'HOUR', 'be', 'honest', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny-', 'oh', ""'d"", 'already', 'done', 'aforementioned', 'Smodcast.See', 'biggest', 'problem', 'here', 'Q', 'A', 'portion', 'show', 'basically', 'non-existent', 'now', 'Barely', 'questions', 'audience', 'get', 'straight', 'response', 'Instead', 'what', 'Kevin', 'twist', 'order', 'do', 'pre-prepared', 'piece', 'Why', ""n't"", 'just', 'tell', 'audience', 'sit', 'down', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'majority', 'lining', 'up', 'ask', 'question', 'were', 'stood', 'up', 'HOURS', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'questions', 'good', 'stuff', 'here', 'mostly', 'second', 'disc', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'bit', 'very', 'interesting', 'taken', 'nearly', 'word-for-word', 'Kevin', 'book', 'My', 'Boring', '[', ']', 'Life', 'took', 'story', 'directly', 'one', 'Kevin', 'previous', 'blogs', 'just', 'wonder', 'what', 'happened', 'Kevin', 'somewhat', 'fiercely', 'attacking', 'big', 'Hollywood', 'names', ""n't"", 'dreadful', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'Smodcast', 'read', 'guy', 'blogs', 'will', 'be', 'highly', 'amused', 'parts', 'rest', 'us-', 'well', 'maybe', 'Kevin', 'just', 'need', 'shut', 'up', 'little', 'bit']",Sold Out: A Threevening With Kevin Smith

Found it boring and drawn out.He takes one subject and talks about it for what seems like an hour. Then wanders off into something else and babbles on. I know, I know... He's always done that! But THIS time its a little boring.As another reviewer stated, there isnt much about movie making in there, nor about comics, which are things his audience want to hear about. Thats the entertaining stuff I want to hear from Keven in these things.There are some funny bits in there though too. Some I heard already (Opie and Anthony), and some other funny stuff.I guess they cant all be winners.If youre a major fanboy like I am, pick it up. But Im sure you'll agree that it seems to drag on.
