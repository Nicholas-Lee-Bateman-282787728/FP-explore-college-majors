But no, she tried to milk the ""Greek Wedding"" cow for all it was worth and came up with this woefully unfunny---and completely unnecessary---TV series, ""My Big Fat Greek Life,"" which was promptly cancelled after only a handful of episodes (when asked why, the CBS president told TV Guide, ""Well, you saw the ratings, and you saw the show""). The charmingly funny Greek family from the movie was reduced to doing pathetic sitcom shtick for the TV series, and I knew that something was very wrong when Vardalos changed her character's name from Toula to her own real-life name of Nia. Can you say, ""ego""?You know what---I'll even go out on a limb and say that it was the TV show that costed Vardalos that much-deserved Academy Award for Best Screenplay for ""Wedding,"" as the Academy must've thought to themselves, ""We can't give an Oscar to something that's not good enough to win an Emmy.""

This sitcom starring the Canadian-Greek comedienne premiered on CBS on February 24,2003. She is Nia Portakolos married to Ian,an all-American man(Steven Eckholdt). John Corbett,who played Ian in the film already had a show of his own,HBO's recently cancelled ""Sex In The City"",so he contractually could not do MBFGL. Also part of the TV cast who also appeared in the film are Gia Carides as Nia's sister,Michael Constantine as the father and Lainie Kazan as the mother. In every episode there are several flashbacks to Nia's childhood with her much younger mom and dad. Rita Wilson served as executive producer as she did for the movie. In addition to Wilson,other memorable guest appearances were made by Joey Fatone of the singing group NSync,who also appeared in the film as Angelo,and Frank Stallone,who's Sylvester's brother. After 6 or 7 episodes,CBS pulled the plug on this sitcom. See tvtome.com for details.

What a stinker.The movie was great, but the sit-com sucks. The movie was full of funny characters, and the humor was very spontaneous. The characters didn't have to try to be funny, because they were just funny anyway. They seemed very genuine in the film, but in the pilot episode of the series, everything seemed so forced. The jokes and one-liners were poorly written and poorly delivered.Furthermore, the chemistry between Ian and Toula in the film was very convincing; Ian was very charming and Toula was very loving. I thought that both Nia Vardalos and John Corbett did a great job. In the show, however, the replacement Ian (called ""Thomas"" in the show) was a total putz, I didn't like him at all, and he had almost no chemistry with Toula (or ""Nia"", rather). In the film, Ian was very accepting and even enthusiastic to espouse the Portokalos family traditions. But in the show, he bitches to Nia about ""boundaries"" and bickers with Gus about who built Stonehenge.The only character that was almost tolerable on the show was Gus, the dad. They overdid his dialogue a bit, but he's still funny to watch.""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" was a great movie, it was relatively inexpensive to produce and made lots of money, and people loved it.

More than 22 million people tuned in on the first night.  However, it barely managed to finish out its first season of 7 episodes before cancellation and spawned numerous &quot;What happened?&quot; articles throught the world of entertainment reporting come May.So, in spite of this, the Columbia-Tri Star have pushed ahead with a DVD release of those seven episodes, possibly hoping to capitalize on the shreds of success still clinging to the name.  Maybe they're hoping that people who never heard of the TV series will pick up the DVD?Well, I for one have to admit that morbid curiosity got the better of me, and I got the DVD yesterday to see if I'd missed anything after watching only the first two episodes in first-run.  Unfortunately, the answer is 'no'.  The lines are still as un-funny in the later episodes, the characters continue to mug for the camera just as much, and Steven Eckholdt continues to be an exceedingly mis-matched choice for Nia Varadalos's renamed character Nia.

None of the irreverence and charm of the film translates to the small screen version. It's often true that the louder the laughtrack, the unfunnier the material, and the laughtrack for this series was as loud and annoying as in the heyday of Sherwood Schwartz (no, I'm not comparing this to &quot;Gilligan's Island&quot; or &quot;Green Acres,&quot; which were astoundingly intellectual and artistic compared to this series). I'm surprised the cast of veterans didn't realize how weak the writing was. I hope Nia Vardalos continues to find success in her writing and performing careers, but it will be no thanks to this turkey. John Corbett proves to be the wisest of the cast members, and I'm sure he's thrilled that contractual obligations found him elsewhere. Cynical network executives must think they can do no wrong by underestimating the intelligence and taste (indeed, the tolerance) of the television audience.

776471,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,B0000CGNEF,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[33, 35]","Following the enormous success of the 2002 film &quot;My Big Fat Greek Wedding&quot;, Brad Grey, Tom Hanks and Nia Vardalos (who wrote and starred in the film), along with 8 other people, produced a TV series sitcom with a similar cast and plot entitled &quot;My Big Fat Greek Life&quot;.  The series aired on CBS in the spring of 2003, but poor viewer ratings brought about its quick demise after only 7 episodes.  Characters that appeared in the TV series that had also appeared in the original film and remained unchanged were Maria Portokalos (Lainie Kazan), Gus Portokalos (Michael Constantine), Nick Portokalos (Louis Mandylor), cousin Nikki (Gia Carides) and Aunt Voula (Andrea Martin).  Nia Vardalos, who played Fortula 'Tula' Portokalos in the film, changed her character's name to Nia Portokalos Miller for the TV series.  John Corbett, who played Tula's husband Ian Miller in the original film, was unable to appear in the TV series due to a previous commitment to another TV series.  (That TV series, &quot;Lucky&quot;, was cancelled by Fox after 13 episodes.)  So, in place of John Corbett, Nia's husband in the TV series was Thomas Miller as played by Steven Eckholdt.Whereas the 2002 film had been expertly written and successfully drew the audience into its tale of self-discovery and love for its main character, 'Tula' Portokalos, the TV series instead focused primarily on jokes and less engaging, often predictable plot lines.  My rating for each of the seven episodes, as well as each episode's air date, are as follows:1. &quot;The House Gift&quot; (3, 2/24/2003).  After returning from their honeymoon, Nia and Thomas are surprised to learn that Gus and Maria have purchased them a new house.2. &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (3.5, 3/3/2003).  Following the hospitalization of a close friend, Maria and Gus decide to write wills that give the restaurant to Nia instead of Nick.3. &quot;Ariana&quot; (4, 3/9/2003).  Cousin Ariana (guest appearance by Rita Wilson) visits from Greece following her divorce from her cheating ex-husband.  Nia wants to help Ariana build an independent life, but Gus and Maria have other plans for her.4. &quot;The Free Lunch&quot; (1.5, 3/16/2003).  The worst written and edited episode of the series, Nia tries to get a loading zone permit for the restaurant. Notable guest appearances include Ken Campbell Rusty Schwimmer.5. &quot;Big Night&quot; (4.5, 3/30/2003).  After Thomas foolishly tries to impress Gus by lying that he knows Pete Sampras, Nia, Voula and Nikki run into Yanni (himself) instead.6. &quot;Nick Moves Out&quot; (4.5, 4/6/2003).  Tired of being taken care of, Nick decides to get an apartment of his own in spite of his parents' objections.7. &quot;Greek Easter&quot; (3.5, 4/13/2003).  Nia wants to impress the family by cooking Easter dinner and surprising Gus with a surprise visitor.  Notable guest appearnace: John Aniston.My overall rating for the short-lived TV series &quot;My Big Fat Greek Life&quot; is 3 out of 5 stars.  Had the same writing quality been applied to the TV series as the film, it would have likely been able to sustain better ratings and had more than 7 episodes.  Unfortunately, the series' two best episodes (#6 and #7) didn't appear until the number of viewers had dropped following several lackluster episodes and one terrible one.",3,"A Very Short-Lived, Mostly LacklusterTV Series",1077494400,"02 23, 2004",2004,3340,"['Following', 'enormous', 'success', '2002', 'film', 'quot', 'My', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'Wedding', 'quot', 'Brad', 'Grey', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Nia', 'Vardalos', 'who', 'wrote', 'starred', 'film', '8', 'other', 'people', 'produced', 'TV', 'series', 'sitcom', 'similar', 'cast', 'plot', 'entitled', 'quot', 'My', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'Life', 'quot', 'series', 'aired', 'CBS', 'spring', '2003', 'poor', 'viewer', 'ratings', 'brought', 'about', 'quick', 'demise', 'only', '7', 'episodes', 'Characters', 'appeared', 'TV', 'series', 'had', 'also', 'appeared', 'original', 'film', 'remained', 'unchanged', 'were', 'Maria', 'Portokalos', 'Lainie', 'Kazan', 'Gus', 'Portokalos', 'Michael', 'Constantine', 'Nick', 'Portokalos', 'Louis', 'Mandylor', 'cousin', 'Nikki', 'Gia', 'Carides', 'Aunt', 'Voula', 'Andrea', 'Martin', 'Nia', 'Vardalos', 'who', 'played', 'Fortula', ""'Tula"", 'Portokalos', 'film', 'changed', 'character', 'name', 'Nia', 'Portokalos', 'Miller', 'TV', 'series', 'John', 'Corbett', 'who', 'played', 'Tula', 'husband', 'Ian', 'Miller', 'original', 'film', 'was', 'unable', 'appear', 'TV', 'series', 'due', 'previous', 'commitment', 'TV', 'series', 'TV', 'series', 'quot', 'Lucky', 'quot', 'was', 'cancelled', 'Fox', '13', 'episodes', 'So', 'place', 'John', 'Corbett', 'Nia', 'husband', 'TV', 'series', 'was', 'Thomas', 'Miller', 'played', 'Steven', 'Eckholdt.Whereas', '2002', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'expertly', 'written', 'successfully', 'drew', 'audience', 'tale', 'self-discovery', 'love', 'main', 'character', 'Portokalos', 'TV', 'series', 'instead', 'focused', 'primarily', 'jokes', 'less', 'engaging', 'often', 'predictable', 'plot', 'lines', 'rating', 'seven', 'episodes', 'as', 'well', 'episode', 'air', 'date', 'are', 'follows:1', 'quot', 'House', 'Gift', 'quot', '3', '2/24/2003', 'returning', 'honeymoon', 'Nia', 'Thomas', 'are', 'surprised', 'learn', 'Gus', 'Maria', 'have', 'purchased', 'new', 'house.2', 'quot', 'Empire', 'Strikes', 'Back', 'quot', '3.5', '3/3/2003', 'Following', 'hospitalization', 'close', 'friend', 'Maria', 'Gus', 'decide', 'write', 'wills', 'give', 'restaurant', 'Nia', 'instead', 'Nick.3', 'quot', 'Ariana', 'quot', '4', '3/9/2003', 'Cousin', 'Ariana', 'guest', 'appearance', 'Rita', 'Wilson', 'Greece', 'following', 'divorce', 'cheating', 'ex-husband', 'Nia', 'help', 'Ariana', 'build', 'independent', 'life', 'Gus', 'Maria', 'have', 'other', 'plans', 'her.4', 'quot', 'Free', 'Lunch', 'quot', '1.5', '3/16/2003', 'worst', 'written', 'edited', 'episode', 'series', 'Nia', 'get', 'loading', 'zone', 'permit', 'restaurant', 'Notable', 'guest', 'appearances', 'include', 'Ken', 'Campbell', 'Rusty', 'Schwimmer.5', 'quot', 'Big', 'Night', 'quot', '4.5', '3/30/2003', 'Thomas', 'foolishly', 'impress', 'Gus', 'lying', 'Pete', 'Sampras', 'Nia', 'Voula', 'Nikki', 'run', 'Yanni', 'instead.6', 'quot', 'Nick', 'Out', 'quot', '4.5', '4/6/2003', 'Tired', 'being', 'taken', 'care', 'Nick', 'get', 'apartment', 'own', 'spite', 'parents', 'objections.7', 'quot', 'Greek', 'Easter', 'quot', '3.5', '4/13/2003', 'impress', 'family', 'cooking', 'Easter', 'dinner', 'surprising', 'Gus', 'surprise', 'visitor', 'Notable', 'guest', 'appearnace', 'John', 'Aniston.My', 'overall', 'rating', 'short-lived', 'TV', 'series', 'quot', 'My', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'Life', 'quot', '3', '5', 'stars', 'Had', 'same', 'writing', 'quality', 'been', 'applied', 'TV', 'series', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'likely', 'been', 'able', 'sustain', 'better', 'ratings', 'had', 'more', '7', 'episodes', 'Unfortunately', 'series', 'two', 'best', 'episodes', '6', '7', 'did', ""n't"", 'appear', 'number', 'viewers', 'had', 'dropped', 'following', 'several', 'lackluster', 'episodes', 'one', 'terrible', 'one']",My Big Fat Greek Life - The Entire Series

You con only tell the same story or the same joke so many times before it gets old (I'm Greek my husband's not, my family is crazy my husband's isn't, etc.).
