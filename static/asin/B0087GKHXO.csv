1547421,A2K7N2E8V89EVN,B0087GKHXO,J Resb,"[3, 4]","I'm enjoying going through each season of Streets of San Francisco.  Season Four continues in the pattern of the first three, with no sense of decline; some shows lose their edge after a few seasons; some, like Star Trek Next Generation, only gain their footing after a few years, but Streets of San Francisco hit the ground running with Episode One of Season One and is still excellent through the final episode of year four.  The patterns are inherently the same, because this is a police - solving - murders show, but that's not a complaint.  As noted in Season One, San Francisco itself is one of the stars; it's also hilarious to watch Michael Douglas drive: he's crazy!  Leslie Nielsen guest starred on a couple of episodes, and you can find the seeds of his cooperation with Mr. Zucker later on Naked Gun in these serious, realistic investigate and chase procedurals. One element is just starting to emerge, though.  Karl Malden's character was written with a piety bordering on self-congratulating arrogance, and you can see it starting to wear on the other characters, including bad guys (Leslie Nielsen's character included).  Maybe the writers were finding Lieutenant Stone a bit of a pain by now.  That doesn't kill the show, though;  you recognize it's who Mike Stone is, it's who he'll be until the day he dies, and let's face it - there are people like that in the world, totally sure of their Knowledge of the True Path, with little empathy or concern for those who don't share their perspective.  Still, I can't overstate my recommendation for Streets of San Francisco.Streets of San Francisco: Season Four, Vols. 1 & 2",5,Another OutSTANDING Season of Streets of San Francisco,1352073600,"11 5, 2012",2012,1636,"[""'m"", 'enjoying', 'going', 'season', 'Streets', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Season', 'Four', 'pattern', 'first', 'three', 'sense', 'decline', 'shows', 'lose', 'edge', 'few', 'seasons', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'only', 'gain', 'footing', 'few', 'years', 'Streets', 'San', 'Francisco', 'hit', 'ground', 'running', 'Episode', 'One', 'Season', 'One', 'still', 'excellent', 'final', 'episode', 'year', 'four', 'patterns', 'are', 'inherently', 'same', 'police', 'solving', 'murders', 'show', 'not', 'complaint', 'noted', 'Season', 'One', 'San', 'Francisco', 'one', 'stars', 'also', 'hilarious', 'watch', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'drive', 'crazy', 'Leslie', 'Nielsen', 'guest', 'starred', 'couple', 'episodes', 'can', 'find', 'seeds', 'cooperation', 'Mr.', 'Zucker', 'later', 'Naked', 'Gun', 'serious', 'realistic', 'investigate', 'chase', 'procedurals', 'One', 'element', 'just', 'starting', 'emerge', 'though', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'character', 'was', 'written', 'piety', 'bordering', 'self-congratulating', 'arrogance', 'can', 'see', 'starting', 'wear', 'other', 'characters', 'including', 'bad', 'guys', 'Leslie', 'Nielsen', 'character', 'included', 'Maybe', 'writers', 'were', 'finding', 'Lieutenant', 'Stone', 'bit', 'pain', 'now', ""n't"", 'kill', 'show', 'recognize', 'who', 'Mike', 'Stone', 'who', ""'ll"", 'be', 'day', 'let', 'face', 'are', 'people', 'world', 'totally', 'sure', 'Knowledge', 'True', 'Path', 'little', 'empathy', 'concern', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'share', 'perspective', 'Still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'overstate', 'recommendation', 'Streets', 'San', 'Francisco.Streets', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Season', 'Four', 'Vols', '1', '2']",N/A

1547424,AF56EQJXPK0S9,B0087GKHXO,Mr. O,"[0, 0]","In my opinion this is the best cop show of all time. Partly because of the chemistry of Karl Malden and Micheal Douglas is true, but also because of the realism of everything that police detectives and the entire police department do. Police know that the first 48 hours in a murder investigation are the most crucial. And here it is brought out quite well how it is a race against the clock to solve a crime. There isn't any Dirty Harry nonsense or any of the disrespect for the Captain as there is in Srarsky and Hutch. This was a show that was made with total respect for the men in uniform and the work they do. The actors that they chose were of very high caliber and were excellent in portraying the life and times of just two not so &#34;ordinary Joe&#34; officers of the law.This is a show that for years I've wondered if it will ever be brought back to television and if I will ever get to see it again, My brother and I grew up watching this in the the seventies when we were in our teens. It was a time when families actually used to sit and watch television together. Before the PC  and the home video games came and separated everyone. And now I own it. To see it when I want and the way we would have all liked, without commercial interruption. And, it was a real good cop show and a pretty close to real portrayal of what being a cop is really like. I forget in which season it was, but then Keller was asked if he liked serving the people (I'm not sure of the correct words) his response was that he really wasn't serving as it was more like a reacting to anyone who dared society to take  them on. And aren't those the true roles of the criminals and the ones we hire to protect us?They don't do television like this anymore and I seriously and sadly believe that they ever will. That kind of writing doesn't exist anymore and those kinds of actors are all but gone. Also, the home audience has changed so much. People are desensitized and are not satisfied with good dialog anymore. Everything now has to be those few words that you would repeat over and over again that really have no meaning like &#34;go ahead, make my day&#34; or some other stupid moronic phrase. Special effects have taken the place of what Hitchcock brought out so masterfully. The ability to see something that wasn't there, because of the fact that the actors of those times knew how to depict horror and fear and many other human emotions with just one facial expression. And the directors knew which would be the best camera angle and what was the best lighting for the full effect of it all.Well, this is the end of my review. I don't know if I will get season 5 as the show for me lost full affect when Douglas left. The other guy wasn't the same. But, in the words of the immortal idiot:&#34;I'll be bock&#34;.",5,By far the best cop show ever made.,1388793600,"01 4, 2014",2014,2808,"['opinion', 'best', 'cop', 'show', 'time', 'Partly', 'chemistry', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'Micheal', 'Douglas', 'true', 'also', 'realism', 'everything', 'police', 'detectives', 'entire', 'police', 'department', 'do', 'Police', 'know', 'first', '48', 'hours', 'murder', 'investigation', 'are', 'most', 'crucial', 'here', 'brought', 'out', 'quite', 'well', 'how', 'race', 'clock', 'solve', 'crime', ""n't"", 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'nonsense', 'disrespect', 'Captain', 'Srarsky', 'Hutch', 'was', 'show', 'was', 'made', 'total', 'respect', 'men', 'uniform', 'work', 'do', 'actors', 'chose', 'were', 'very', 'high', 'caliber', 'were', 'excellent', 'portraying', 'life', 'times', 'just', 'two', 'not', 'so', '34', 'ordinary', 'Joe', '34', 'officers', 'law.This', 'show', 'years', ""'ve"", 'wondered', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'brought', 'back', 'television', 'will', 'ever', 'get', 'see', 'again', 'My', 'brother', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'seventies', 'when', 'were', 'teens', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'families', 'actually', 'used', 'sit', 'watch', 'television', 'together', 'PC', 'home', 'video', 'games', 'came', 'separated', 'everyone', 'now', 'own', 'see', 'when', 'want', 'way', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'commercial', 'interruption', 'was', 'real', 'good', 'cop', 'show', 'pretty', 'close', 'real', 'portrayal', 'what', 'being', 'cop', 'really', 'like', 'forget', 'season', 'was', 'then', 'Keller', 'was', 'asked', 'liked', 'serving', 'people', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'correct', 'words', 'response', 'was', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'serving', 'was', 'more', 'reacting', 'anyone', 'who', 'dared', 'society', 'take', 'are', ""n't"", 'true', 'roles', 'criminals', 'ones', 'hire', 'protect', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'television', 'anymore', 'seriously', 'sadly', 'believe', 'ever', 'will', 'kind', 'writing', ""n't"", 'exist', 'anymore', 'kinds', 'actors', 'are', 'gone', 'Also', 'home', 'audience', 'changed', 'so', 'much', 'People', 'are', 'desensitized', 'are', 'not', 'satisfied', 'good', 'dialog', 'anymore', 'Everything', 'now', 'be', 'few', 'words', 'would', 'repeat', 'over', 'again', 'really', 'have', 'meaning', '34', 'go', 'ahead', 'make', 'day', '34', 'other', 'stupid', 'moronic', 'phrase', 'Special', 'effects', 'have', 'taken', 'place', 'what', 'Hitchcock', 'brought', 'out', 'so', 'masterfully', 'ability', 'see', 'something', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'fact', 'actors', 'times', 'knew', 'how', 'depict', 'horror', 'fear', 'many', 'other', 'human', 'emotions', 'just', 'one', 'facial', 'expression', 'directors', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'camera', 'angle', 'was', 'best', 'lighting', 'full', 'effect', 'all.Well', 'end', 'review', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'will', 'get', 'season', '5', 'show', 'lost', 'full', 'affect', 'when', 'Douglas', 'left', 'other', 'guy', 'was', ""n't"", 'same', 'words', 'immortal', 'idiot', '34', ""'ll"", 'be', 'bock', '34']",N/A
