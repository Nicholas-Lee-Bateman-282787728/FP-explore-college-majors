My only complaint, and it's not just about this movie but seems every movie anymore has such loud background music that it drowns out the voices to the point where it becomes frustrating to watch.  It is a shame that this happens because so much of what is said, can't be heard.",5,Exciting movie!,1402617600,"06 13, 2014",2014,373,"['was', 'bit', 'different', 'storyline', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'also', 'had', 'great', 'scenery', 'only', 'complaint', 'not', 'just', 'movie', 'movie', 'anymore', 'such', 'loud', 'background', 'music', 'out', 'voices', 'point', 'where', 'frustrating', 'watch', 'shame', 'so', 'much', 'what', 'said', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'heard']",Gold Retrievers

There are no Golden Retrievers in this movie anywhere, much less puppies, just a yellow lab with hardly any part to play. I've lost count of how many ""bumbling crook"" duos have made it into children's films, but this pair is surely the dumbest, most pathetic I have ever seen in my life! Absolutely ridiculous.
