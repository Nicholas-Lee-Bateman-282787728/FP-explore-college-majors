49453,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0783222149,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","One should know that a Meryl Streep action film is not going to be your typical action film, since Meryl Streep is not your typical action heroine.  No, Meryl is your `every-woman', and as that every-woman she brings a level of humanism to her role as a suburban mother taken hostage by thugs in a raft.  She manages to sell us on the action while inserting enough drama and honesty into her character development to have us `feeling' for her and her family every step of the way.For what it is, `The River Wild' is a standard and stand-up action flick.  It centers on a family out for a birthday rafting trip to try and salvage what is left of their rocky marriage.  When complications arise in her husband's schedule, Gail decides to leave for the trip with her son.  That is when Wade and Terry come into the picture.  These two shady characters make their shadiness known relatively quickly, despite lathering on the manipulative charm.  Soon, Gail and her son are relatively kidnapped and forced to navigate these killers through a rough patch of waters.The thrills in the film are satisfactory, nothing extreme or truly breathtaking and yet wholly effective.  It certainly feels like a watered-down thriller, but one that has nice performances, especially from Streep, and some nice photography.  Bacon is rather familiar here, and the plot itself feels slightly too farfetched (or maybe it's that it is too simple) but at the end of the day it is a nice way to spend an evening in.",4,This river is a tad reserved but works all the same...,1378252800,"09 4, 2013",2013,1488,"['One', 'should', 'know', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'action', 'film', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'typical', 'action', 'film', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'not', 'typical', 'action', 'heroine', 'No', 'Meryl', 'every-woman', 'every-woman', 'level', 'humanism', 'role', 'suburban', 'mother', 'taken', 'hostage', 'thugs', 'raft', 'sell', 'action', 'inserting', 'enough', 'drama', 'honesty', 'character', 'development', 'have', 'feeling', 'family', 'step', 'way.For', 'what', 'River', 'Wild', 'standard', 'stand-up', 'action', 'flick', 'family', 'out', 'birthday', 'rafting', 'trip', 'try', 'salvage', 'what', 'left', 'rocky', 'marriage', 'When', 'complications', 'arise', 'husband', 'schedule', 'Gail', 'leave', 'trip', 'son', 'when', 'Wade', 'Terry', 'come', 'picture', 'two', 'shady', 'characters', 'make', 'shadiness', 'known', 'relatively', 'quickly', 'lathering', 'manipulative', 'charm', 'Soon', 'Gail', 'son', 'are', 'relatively', 'kidnapped', 'forced', 'navigate', 'killers', 'rough', 'patch', 'waters.The', 'thrills', 'film', 'are', 'satisfactory', 'nothing', 'extreme', 'truly', 'breathtaking', 'yet', 'wholly', 'effective', 'certainly', 'watered-down', 'thriller', 'one', 'nice', 'performances', 'especially', 'Streep', 'nice', 'photography', 'Bacon', 'rather', 'familiar', 'here', 'plot', 'slightly', 'too', 'farfetched', 'maybe', 'too', 'simple', 'end', 'day', 'nice', 'way', 'spend', 'evening']",N/A

49455,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,0783222149,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 1]","Filmed in various gorgeous western settings including Montana's Glacier National Park, THE RIVER WILD (1994) is a crime drama that plays out on a river with various rapids, hazards and eddies, plus a mile-and-a-half killer section that's so dangerous, rafters are no longer permitted to navigate it.These monstrous falls and rapids are at the convergence of three rivers, one of which is arctic cold. Anyone unfortunate enough to be thrown into the water while trying to buck the currents won't necessarily drown but will surely die of hypothermia.As the adventure begins, Tom  Hartman and Gail, his expert rafter wife, take young son Roarke on a river trip as a birthday present. They encounter three men who are also rafting. One's an expert guide, the others seem oddly out of place here. When next they meet, the guide is gone (he supposedly abandoned the others) and the two ask if they can tag along, because neither knows thing one about rafting and there's no way to walk out safely.Terry and especially Wade are creepy, possibly dangerous, and the couple decide to try to break away from them. This attempt fails, and this is where they learn the full extent of the danger they're in. Now captives of two robbers, one of whom (Wade) killed a man during the heist, they mustshoot the dangerous rapids with Wade and Terry or risk being murdered here and now. The Hartmans have one slim hope: Wade can't swim. Just maybe, if Gail can cause the raft to overturn before they reach the rapids, her family can get out of this alive.It's an exciting story that stars Meryl Streep and David Strathairn as Tom and Gail, Joseph Mazzello as their brave pre-teen son Roarke, Kevin Bacon as homicidal Wade, John C. Reilly as Terry, his none-too-bright cohort, and Benjamin Bratt as Ranger Johnny, a nice fellow who encounters the five at exactly the wrong moment.Features a spectacular final rafting sequence followed by yet more nail-biting action. A truly excellent movie that's totally underrated at IMDb (6.2). Don't miss it!",5,"Wade (to Tom): ""I'm in charge now. I could bury you and Roarke tonight.

The only thing that saves this film from getting just one star is the wonderful acting of Meryl Streep.  She does a fantastic job of believably playing a gritty former river guide and a loving mom.  The rest of this movie doesn't fare nearly as well.""The River Wild"" is about a mother, father, son and dog who go on an adventure whitewater rafting down a river.  They encounter some shady characters who are rafting down the same river.  I typically break down the plot of the movie in my reviews but it is rather pointless here.  Everything is completely obvious from a mile away and I do mean EVERYTHING.  There are also several completely ridiculous parts of this film.  For one, there is a portion of the movie where the father has to follow along the river on foot through treacherous terrain.  At the same time, his river guide wife is rolling down the river in a raft.  Guess who makes it downstream faster?  That's right...the father.  Give me a break!  There are too many more moronic things like this for me to waste my time going over them.  In short, if you fancy whitewater rafting and Meryl Streep then check this one out.

""The River Wild"" packs about the same punch as a Lifetime Network movie, but with an A-List cast.I normally love Meryl Streep in just about anything, and she does a fine job here, but the material is just so tepid there really isn't anything to work with. David Straithairn looking as though he just stepped out of a power-lunch with the CEO also does a decent job as the city-boy lost in the wild, but again outside of being given the ""too-busy-to-enjoy-my-family"" schtick, they don't really give him anything to do here. His decent into ""survivalist"" mode consists of his clothes getting wet and his hair getting messy. The best role in the film is reserved for Kevin Bacon as the heel. Playing the smarmy, backwoodsy killer who takes Streep and family hostage, Bacon does a great job in the film, and is the only reason I recommend giving this movie a spin in the DVD player. But surrounding him with a whiny kid, a dorky co-bad-guy, inept river police etc. and any edge of danger is sucked right out of the character.The ham-handed direction even sucks the beauty out of the landscape, and the menace out of the rapids.

""River Wild"" is a 'sit back and enjoy it' adventure/ thriller.Here's the scoop. Meryl Streep is having problems with her workoholic husband, David Strathairn, who might again bail on their yearly boating excursion down a wild river. He makes it at the last minute but the trip is interrupted by the likes of three no-gooders who just robbed a cattle auction and plan to use Streep to escape down the river and through ""The Gauntlet"" a nearly impassible stretch of rapids.This is a well crafted, well directed thriller. I'm not certain where it was set but it quite possibly might be Washington State. The scenery is used to great effect combining both beauty and menace. This was about midway in director Curtis Hansen's career and though not up to his later ""L.A. Confidential,"" it's still a heck of a ride. There are a couple of thrills that are of the cheap variety but much else of what goes on is more than watchable. For instance: When they hit ""The Gauntlet"" it's a real nail biter. And when Streep informs them, while laughing uncontrollably, what's going to happen to them when they get there, it's something to behold.Streep is her usual good self in an a-typical role. Strathairn is good as well. Kevin Bacon does well as the bad guy. He starts out nice, but when push comes to shove he becomes ruthless and will kill without a second thought. I like John C. Reilly as Bacon's side kick, and he's good here. I do wish they would have fleshed out his character a bit more.This isn't great art but it's very good craft.

Reilly as Terry,Wades partner.It's a film that slowly builds its' suspense throughout,keeping the characters and us in the dark until it needs to.This is a neat trick,but a good one,often used to pull the audience right into the action on screen.The plot finds Gail and Tom in a marriage strained.Tom is a busy architect who doesn't seem to have much time for his family.Gail has packed up for a trip white water rafting,back near her hometown in Idaho.Tom comes home but is unable to go,apparently because of his workload.Gail leaves with her two children and returns home.The next day Gail,their dog and her son are all set with the raft(her daughter stays behind with her parents),when Tom pulls up at the last minute to join them.The trip,for the first while,is a strained one,as their personal problems come periodically boiling to the surface.Down stream they meet up with two men,Wade and Terry,who they had meet when first starting out.It seems the third man in their party,a white water guide,has walked out on them after an argument.They have a raft but were afraid to attempt upcoming rapids nearby alone,as they had no experience.Gail and Tom reluctantly agree to take them along.Along the way Wade accidentally falls into the water and Tom jumps in and attempts a rescue.Tom is almost pulled under and drowned by Wade until Tom has to use force on Wade to calm him down.Wade cozy's up to Roarke,the pairs son,even giving Roarke $200 on his birthday.Roarke is forced to return the money,starining the air between the couple and the two men.One night after Tom and Gail look like they are on their way to re-connecting,Gail takes a skinny dip to wash up.It starts to rain and the dog,who is kind of standing guard,starts to bark.In the flicker of the lightning in the sky she sees Wade standing on an embankment staring at her.The next day the pair decide they had better high tail it out, as they just do not trust the men anymore.In a ruse Tom gets away from Terry and he runs and jumps into the waiting raft Gail is in.They break away down river to pick up their son who is there fishing.Tom has to run after Roarke who does not want to leave his new found friend Wade;and that is who they both run into.Wade and Tom have words and Wade pulls out a gun.From now on,it is game on.We learn Wade and Terry are fugitives from an auction robbery of quite a substantial sum of money.They picked the river as an escape route,thinking no one would ever think to look for them there.They also intend going past the last safe stop point on the river,and proceed down through off-limit rapids,and they will use Gail as their guide through them.One evening Tom manages to escape from the men,as had their dog previously that day.Wade claims/thinks he fatally shot Tom.Tom follows the four of them,and in fact reaches an old abandoned safe station below the killer rapids first.He rigs up an old thick wire that spans the river to up end the raft once it reaches that spot.Meanwhile Gail,who has been tied to the raft,along with her son,is busy maneuvering the rapids with the men's help.The four come close to being upended but in the end Gail sails the raft successfully through.Through smoke signals Tom makes,Gail realizes Tom is alright and she reaches the point Tom wants her to.Tom releases the wire which upends the boat.Gail gets Wade's gun and forced to shoot Wade,who drifts downstream.Tom,Roarke and Gail are reunited and the authorities are called and arrive to pick up the bodies and rescue everyone.The film was shot on location in Montana and Oregon and features some pretty spectacular scenery throughout.It is obvious that Streep did alot of her own rowing,which she is to be commended for.Rafting is a tough sport and require tons of stamina and skill.Bacon does a great job as the menacing Wade,cold and calculating.David Strathairn also does a good job as the husband whose strained marriage shows on every inch of his face.I could remark on some plot holes:like Tom's miraculous speed as he beat Streep and the guys down river(he was traveling light after all,I guess!),the implausibility of Gail sticking around another second after she was google-eyed by Wade that night while bathing alone,and any of them sticking around as long as they did with these guys.Would you have ignored such warning signs that long? However,this is Hollywood folks and it is just a movie,not real life.We have a plot to get from A-Z with and sometimes in order to get there we have to circumvent a few letters along the way.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and looks clear.It does have however some dirt and the odd line here and there in it,but overall its pretty good looking.Extras include some cast and crew bios and production notes.All in all a very good thriller,with the plot base around a white water rafting trip that goes south before its main participants have time to react.Well acted,ignore the plot holes and just enjoy the suspense.Recommended.",4,Could you survive a river this wild?,1348790400,"09 28, 2012",2012,5249,"['River', 'Wild', 'released', 'Sept/94', 'been', 'TV',

You witness intimately the determination building in her expression as she makes her thrust into the final stretch. Beginning with this moment, it unfolds into the underlying theme, poignant in it's simplicity - and although it's been said before, ""many times, many ways"", it pulls it off splendidly as it begins to delve into the best and the worst of us, and of the undiscovered elements lying deep within the character of people we know or should know - best.It is about Gail, a strong, adventurous Alpha female confident of her abilities, and of sound character played with anticipated magnificence by Meryl Streep; her little boy, Roarke, whom she desires to keep in close contact with her own family roots even though they are living half a continent and culture away, in Boston; her husband, Tom, (great job by David Straithairn) for whom she has lost respect and feels that he is not only struggling in his work as an architect, but has, in the process, sold his soul to it and can think of nothing else.  As we discover, nothing could be farther from the truth.Kevin Bacon as Wade, the modern day outlaw who has masterminded - if that is the right word - an armed robbery of a cattle auction, establishes his ""real bad boy"" role with talent, and his slow-witted but harmless companion, played by John C. Reilly, has found himself deep in a situation he is ill-equipped to play with.  The unlikely combination of individual people and their problems meet fatefully at the wilderness river where they are all embarking down it for entirely different reasons; and from there it becomes a battle of wits, arrogance vs ingenuity and ability, Love against Lost; with the bonds between Gail, Tom and Roarke that have nearly been broken by circumstance brought together once again by need. I suspect that Tom will return to Boston with a new opinion of himself.A beautiful movie, directed and cast impeccably, this is one for the home collection, in my view - and I highly recommend it as one to watch over and over again, never tiring in the scope of the message - and being transported from the serene, New England intro as it melds into wild white water and mountainous splendor.",5,"""Let Us Gather at The River""",1262995200,"01 9, 2010",2010,2995,"['glorious', 'movie', 'adventure', 'scenery', 'soundtrack', 'casting', 'perfect', 'roles', 'underlying', 'story', 'set', 'wild', 'country', 'Montana.It', 'fluid', 'movement', 'boat', 'gliding', 'gold-touched', 'calm', 'water', 'viewer', 'moment', 'sound', 'track', 'play', 'splendidly', 'filmed', 'intro', 'Streep', 'rowing', 'placid', 'water', 'Old', 'Boston', 'setting', 'complete', 'big', 'gentle', 'river', 'overhung', 'foilage', 'Revolutionary', 'background', 'stunning', 'old', 'stonework', 'building', 'bridge', 'obviously', 'keeping', 'shape', 'trip', 'back', 'homeland', 'wild', 'river', 'glimpse', 'psyche', 'not', 'merely', 'exercise', 'internal', 'challenge', 'herself', 'must', 'row', 'bridge', 'train', 'rumbles', 'witness', 'intimately', 'determination', 'building', 'expression', 'thrust', 'final', 'stretch', 'Beginning', 'moment', 'underlying', 'theme', 'poignant', 'simplicity', 'been', 'said', 'many', 'times', 'many', 'ways', 'off', 'splendidly', 'delve', 'best', 'worst', 'undiscovered', 'elements', 'lying', 'deep', 'character', 'people', 'know', 'should', 'know', 'best.It', 'Gail', 'strong', 'adventurous', 'Alpha', 'female', 'confident', 'abilities', 'sound', 'character', 'played', 'anticipated', 'magnificence', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'little', 'boy', 'Roarke', 'whom', 'keep', 'close', 'contact', 'own', 'family', 'roots', 'even', 'are', 'living', 'continent', 'culture', 'away', 'Boston', 'husband', 'Tom', 'great', 'job', 'David', 'Straithairn', 'whom', 'lost', 'respect', 'feels', 'not', 'only', 'struggling', 'work', 'architect', 'process', 'sold', 'soul', 'can', 'think', 'nothing', 'else', 'discover', 'nothing', 'could', 'be', 'farther', 'truth.Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Wade', 'modern', 'day', 'outlaw', 'who', 'masterminded', 'right', 'word', 'armed', 'robbery', 'cattle', 'auction', 'real', 'bad', 'boy', 'role', 'talent', 'slow-witted', 'harmless', 'companion', 'played', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'found', 'deep', 'situation', 'ill-equipped', 'play', 'unlikely', 'combination', 'individual', 'people', 'problems', 'meet', 'fatefully', 'wilderness', 'river', 'where', 'are', 'embarking', 'down', 'entirely', 'different', 'reasons', 'battle', 'wits', 'arrogance', 'vs', 'ingenuity', 'ability', 'Love', 'Lost', 'bonds', 'Gail', 'Tom', 'Roarke', 'have', 'nearly', 'been', 'broken', 'circumstance', 'brought', 'together', 'once', 'again', 'need', 'suspect', 'Tom', 'will', 'return', 'Boston', 'new', 'opinion', 'himself.A', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'directed', 'cast', 'impeccably', 'one', 'home', 'collection', 'view', 'highly', 'recommend', 'one', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'never', 'tiring', 'scope', 'message', 'being', 'transported', 'serene', 'New', 'England', 'intro', 'wild', 'white', 'water', 'mountainous', 'splendor']",N/A
