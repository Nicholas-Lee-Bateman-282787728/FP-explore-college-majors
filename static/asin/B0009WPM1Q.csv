But after randomly watching one episode, I was instantly hooked!  This really shows that medicine isn't always perfect, but the kind of mysteries are well done.I love the entire cast!  Chase is hot, Foreman is a jerk, Wilson is the dork, Cuddy is the drill sargeant, Cameron is the sensible one and of course... House is our lovely pill popper, limping, cynical doctor.  Laurie really steals the show with his mean comebacks and dark personality.  This season was good to learn about the characters' past and attitude, though it was a bit short.

As I Brit (living in NY) I've known of Hugh Laurie through his excellent comedy roles (Bit of Fry And Laurie, Black Adder, Jeeves and Wooster). Now Black Adder is regarded as one of the finest (and therefore one of the funniest) comedies ever produced in the UK, and so Hugh Laurie is fairly well know there.Watching him in a serious(?) role has been nothing less than astounding! It's also interesting that the direction the program goes in is not entirely predictable, Love interest, Student betrayals.However, it's not just Hugh, who steals virtually every scene he is in, but the rest of the cast fill in well too, the scripts are excellent, the acting excellent, and it is well directed. My only caveat is I wish he would fail sometimes, though of course that would mean dead bodies (which do occur).Very much looking forward to the next season!",5,Impressive 51 5 Stars and here no exception,1123459200,"08 8, 2005",2005,894,"['far', 'favorite', 'current', 'TV', 'show', 'Brit', 'living', 'NY', ""'ve"", 'known', 'Hugh', 'Laurie', 'excellent', 'comedy', 'roles', 'Bit', 'Fry', 'Laurie', 'Black', 'Adder', 'Jeeves', 'Wooster', 'Now', 'Black', 'Adder', 'regarded', 'one', 'finest', 'therefore', 'one', 'funniest', 'comedies', 'ever', 'produced', 'UK', 'so', 'Hugh', 'Laurie', 'fairly', 'well', 'know', 'there.Watching', 'serious', 'role', 'been', 'nothing', 'less', 'astounding', 'also', 'interesting', 'direction', 'program', 'not', 'entirely', 'predictable', 'Love', 'interest', 'Student', 'betrayals.However', 'not', 'just', 'Hugh', 'who', 'virtually', 'scene', 'rest', 'cast', 'fill', 'well', 'too', 'scripts', 'are', 'excellent', 'acting', 'excellent', 'well', 'directed', 'only', 'caveat', 'wish', 'would', 'fail', 'sometimes', 'course', 'would', 'mean', 'dead', 'bodies', 'do', 'occur', '.Very', 'much', 'looking', 'forward', 'next', 'season']",N/A
914943,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B0009WPM1Q,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","House Season One, 2004-05This set has twenty-two episodes on three double-sided DVDs. Gregory House MD is a modern version of ""Sherlock Holmes"", a character who is shown to be most observant and knowledgeable than his co-workers. The camera is the ""Dr. Watson"" to record the events. The location is the ""Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital"" in New Jersey. ""Everybody lies"" is his slogan. House acts and does what he wishes (as if he owned the business). Would his temper tantrums fly in the real world? Would his pill popping also be acceptable? [A nurse once told me she hated this show because it was so false to what she saw in her workplace. I told her Hollywood makes drama and entertainment, a non-fiction book reality.] This show has a very high amount of drama and personal conflicts. Is that its attraction? A patient arrives at a hospital. There are conflicts about the diagnosis. Finally Dr. House correctly diagnoses the problem so it can be cured. This is the recurring plot, as regular as in the ""Perry Mason"" shows.Watching this show is not a substitute for seeing a doctor for any problem. The important lesson here is that a problem cannot be solved until it is correctly diagnosed. Think of that when you read opinions in the newspapers or hear opinions on the radio or television. Do they really know what they're talking about? Or are they just putting out lies or half-truths to promote an agenda that they are being paid to do? How many people die yearly from a mistake in their prescriptions? How many people die each year from a doctor's mistake? [These figures are not readily available.] For comparison there are about 31,000 deaths each year from firearms in this country (about 1 in 10,000). Before the 1968 Federal Gun Control Law this figure was about half. Motor vehicle deaths are much higher (there are more of them in use every day). The actual rate is more informative than a simple count. This show, like some foods, is best taken in small doses.Disc 1 Side A has four episodes:""Pilot""; ""Paternity""; ""Occam's Razor""; ""Maternity"".Disc 1 Side B has four episodes:""Damned If You Do""; ""The Socratic Method""; ""Fidelity""; ""Poison"".Disc 2 Side A has four episodes:""DNR""; ""Histories""; ""Detox""; ""Sports Medicine"".Disc 2 Side B has four episodes:""Cursed""; ""Control""; ""Mob Rules""; ""Heavy"".Disc 3 Side A has four episodes:""Role Model""; ""Babies & Bathwater""; ""Kids""; :Love Hurts"".Disc 3 Side B has two episodes::""Three Stories""; ""Honeymoon"".",5,Drama in a Hospital Setting,1384560000,"11 16, 2013",2013,2467,"['House', 'Season', 'One', '2004-05This', 'set', 'twenty-two', 'episodes', 'three', 'double-sided', 'DVDs', 'Gregory', 'House', 'MD', 'modern', 'version', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'character', 'who', 'shown', 'be', 'most', 'observant', 'knowledgeable', 'co-workers', 'camera', 'Dr.', 'Watson', 'record', 'events', 'location', 'Princeton-Plainsboro', 'Teaching', 'Hospital', 'New', 'Jersey', 'Everybody', 'slogan', 'House', 'what', 'owned', 'business', 'Would', 'temper', 'tantrums', 'fly', 'real', 'world', 'Would', 'pill', 'popping', 'also', 'be', 'acceptable', '[', 'nurse', 'once', 'told', 'hated', 'show', 'was', 'so', 'false', 'what', 'saw', 'workplace', 'told', 'Hollywood', 'drama', 'entertainment', 'non-fiction', 'book', 'reality', ']', 'show', 'very', 'high', 'amount', 'drama', 'personal', 'conflicts', 'attraction', 'patient', 'hospital', 'are', 'conflicts', 'diagnosis', 'Finally', 'Dr.', 'House', 'correctly', 'problem', 'can', 'be', 'cured', 'recurring', 'plot', 'as', 'regular', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'shows.Watching', 'show', 'not', 'substitute', 'seeing', 'doctor', 'problem', 'important', 'lesson', 'here', 'problem', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'solved', 'correctly', 'diagnosed', 'Think', 'when', 'read', 'opinions', 'newspapers', 'hear', 'opinions', 'radio', 'television', 'Do', 'really', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'talking', 'are', 'just', 'putting', 'out', 'lies', 'half-truths', 'promote', 'agenda', 'are', 'being', 'paid', 'do', 'How', 'many', 'people', 'die', 'yearly', 'mistake', 'prescriptions', 'How', 'many', 'people', 'die', 'year', 'doctor', 'mistake', 'figures', 'are', 'not', 'readily', 'available', ']', 'comparison', 'are', '31,000', 'deaths', 'year', 'firearms', 'country', '1', '10,000', '1968', 'Federal', 'Gun', 'Control', 'Law', 'figure', 'was', 'half', 'Motor', 'vehicle', 'deaths', 'are', 'much', 'higher', 'are', 'more', 'use', 'day', 'actual', 'rate', 'more', 'informative', 'simple', 'count', 'show', 'foods', 'best', 'taken', 'small', 'doses.Disc', '1', 'Side', 'A', 'four', 'episodes', 'Pilot', 'Paternity', 'Occam', 'Razor', 'Maternity', '1', 'Side', 'B', 'four', 'episodes', 'Damned', 'Do', 'Socratic', 'Method', 'Fidelity', 'Poison', '2', 'Side', 'A', 'four', 'episodes', 'DNR', 'Histories', 'Detox', 'Sports', 'Medicine', '2', 'Side', 'B', 'four', 'episodes', 'Cursed', 'Control', 'Mob', 'Rules', 'Heavy', '3', 'Side', 'A', 'four', 'episodes', 'Role', 'Model', 'Babies', 'Bathwater', 'Kids', 'Love', 'Hurts', '3', 'Side', 'B', 'two', 'episodes', 'Three', 'Stories', 'Honeymoon']",N/A

914955,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B0009WPM1Q,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[6, 6]","I've never really been a fan of hospital dramas (I don't think I've ever seen an entire episode of ER).  I don't really know why; I've just never gotten into them (however, I love Scrubs, which is a hospital comedy).  However, when I started seeing commercials for House, I thought that it looked interesting, but I never really checked it out until the end of its first season.  After hearing a lot of praise about it, and learning that Bryan Singer was one of the executive producers, I finally sat down and watched it.  I quickly realized that not only was this a compelling hospital drama, but it was absolutely hilarious!Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie) is a brilliant doctor who works at teaching hospital.  He and his team of specialists can solve nearly every case that's brought before them.  Sounds familiar and boring?  The twist is that House is one of the most cynical and outspoken men on the face of the planet.  He never passes up an opportunity to point out someone's stupidity, a lie, or just plain make someone uncomfortable.  He even told one of his team members, Dr. Allison Cameron (Jennifer Morrison) that he hired her not because of her credentials, but because she was the best-looking applicant.  He also constantly mouths off to the hospital's chief of medicine, Dr. Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein), who only puts up with House because he is such an asset to the hospital.  House also requires the use of a cane due to a medical condition in his past that wasn't treated fast enough.  He takes pills to subdue the constant pain that he is in.  Other cast members include Robert Sean Leonard as Dr. James Wilson, House's (probably only) friend, and Omar Epps and Jesse Spencer as team members Drs. Eric Foreman and Robert Chase, respectively.Most episodes involve a main plot about someone contracting some disease that baffles most doctors, and Hosue, Wilson, and the team try to figure out what it is.  Also, there is usually a ""B"" story in which House has to put up with a patient with a non-lethal condition (my favorite involves an elderly couple and viagra).  Finally, an arc develops when rich businessman Edward Vogler (Chi McBride) buys the hospital and tries to raise profits, cut departments, and lose House.  Also, Sela Ward shows up towards the end of the year as House's ex-wife, who knows about how House got to be the way that he is now.House came along at a pretty good time.  The hospital drama has pretty much flatlined, and this is just the show to shock the genre back to life.  All the actors are very good, but Laurie should receive special mention.  He plays House so well, with perfect timing on everything.  He is up for an Emmy for Best Actor in a Drama, and he deserves the nomination (I want Kiefer Sutherland to win, though).  Hopefully, the show will just continue to get better.",5,The Doc Makes A House Call On DVD,1124841600,"08 24, 2005",2005,2831,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'really', 'been', 'fan', 'hospital', 'dramas', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'entire', 'episode', 'ER', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'why', ""'ve"", 'just', 'never', 'gotten', 'however', 'love', 'Scrubs', 'hospital', 'comedy', 'However', 'when', 'started', 'seeing', 'commercials', 'House', 'thought', 'looked', 'interesting', 'never', 'really', 'checked', 'out', 'end', 'first', 'season', 'hearing', 'lot', 'praise', 'learning', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'was', 'one', 'executive', 'producers', 'finally', 'sat', 'down', 'watched', 'quickly', 'realized', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'compelling', 'hospital', 'drama', 'was', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'Dr', 'Gregory', 'House', 'Hugh', 'Laurie', 'brilliant', 'doctor', 'who', 'teaching', 'hospital', 'team', 'specialists', 'can', 'solve', 'nearly', 'case', 'brought', 'familiar', 'boring', 'twist', 'House', 'one', 'most', 'cynical', 'outspoken', 'men', 'face', 'planet', 'never', 'up', 'opportunity', 'point', 'out', 'someone', 'stupidity', 'lie', 'just', 'plain', 'make', 'someone', 'uncomfortable', 'even', 'told', 'one', 'team', 'members', 'Dr.', 'Allison', 'Cameron', 'Jennifer', 'Morrison', 'hired', 'not', 'credentials', 'was', 'best-looking', 'applicant', 'also', 'constantly', 'hospital', 'chief', 'medicine', 'Dr.', 'Lisa', 'Cuddy', 'Lisa', 'Edelstein', 'who', 'only', 'up', 'House', 'such', 'asset', 'hospital', 'House', 'also', 'use', 'cane', 'due', 'medical', 'condition', 'past', 'was', ""n't"", 'treated', 'fast', 'enough', 'pills', 'subdue', 'constant', 'pain', 'Other', 'cast', 'members', 'include', 'Robert', 'Sean', 'Leonard', 'Dr.', 'James', 'Wilson', 'House', 'probably', 'only', 'friend', 'Omar', 'Epps', 'Jesse', 'Spencer', 'team', 'members', 'Drs', 'Eric', 'Foreman', 'Robert', 'Chase', 'respectively.Most', 'episodes', 'involve', 'main', 'plot', 'someone', 'contracting', 'disease', 'most', 'doctors', 'Hosue', 'Wilson', 'team', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'Also', 'usually', 'B', 'story', 'House', 'put', 'up', 'patient', 'non-lethal', 'condition', 'favorite', 'elderly', 'couple', 'viagra', 'Finally', 'arc', 'when', 'rich', 'businessman', 'Edward', 'Vogler', 'Chi', 'McBride', 'hospital', 'tries', 'raise', 'profits', 'cut', 'departments', 'lose', 'House', 'Also', 'Sela', 'Ward', 'up', 'towards', 'end', 'year', 'House', 'ex-wife', 'who', 'how', 'House', 'got', 'be', 'way', 'now.House', 'came', 'along', 'pretty', 'good', 'time', 'hospital', 'drama', 'pretty', 'much', 'flatlined', 'just', 'show', 'shock', 'genre', 'back', 'life', 'actors', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'Laurie', 'should', 'receive', 'special', 'mention', 'House', 'so', 'well', 'perfect', 'timing', 'everything', 'up', 'Emmy', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Drama', 'nomination', 'want', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'win', 'Hopefully', 'show', 'will', 'just', 'continue', 'get', 'better']",N/A

Anyway, I first bought 'Season One' of ""House, MD"" because I've rarely been disappointed with Fox Network drama shows [witness ""Sons of Anarchy"" or ""THE SHIELD"" [et al] and of which I have all the episodes although I'm still waiting for the latest SOA which I pre-ordered back in October!] and Hugh Laurie who plays Dr. Gregory House did not disappoint with the result that I just ordered the whole series including the pre-ordered Season Seven! It's 'that' riveting! And the humor, hey, one episode with the nuns [Season One] and the hospital administrator [no, not to fret, I won't give away what happens!] makes with, ""Don't you know they could sue us!"" and Doc House, being his usual self says rather cavalierly, ""Ohhh, they wouldn't ever do that [pauses] the worst would be hitting us with a ruler!"" Having gone through the parochial school system in the 50's, I can well attest to that! Think our friends Jake and Elwood Blues ... when they visited the ""penguin"" at the orphanage! ;-)The writing is superb and the scientific material [including those in-show mini-visuals] are not only well done but scientifically researched. In short, I like the guy! As I do the supporting cast members and the overall structure of the show. Hey, just like Fox's ""Sons of Anarchy"" series, there are reasons why certain shows get renewed year after year! Sort of a 'vox populi' kind of thing!

This medical drama is a throw back to some of the best of 1960's medical shows like  Medical Center, Ben Casey, Dr. Kildare, Trapper John MD . . . a bloodless medical show. ER and Grey's Anatomy tends to show operations and detail most of the watcher don't need to see, especially me!Its lead character, Doctor  Gregory House played by Golden Globe winner Hugh Laurie is the brilliance chief of a disease department of a hospital who's skill and intellect is slight offbeat. He insults the medical profession where he is a member. With his quirky wry, sarcastic way, House never bores the audience with his strange style. His casual style (unshaven, T-shirt, no tie, etc.) is so anti medical, which makes this show watch able. Laurie is the lynch pin that holds this medical drama together.He and his team investigate medical emergencies like the CSI investigates crime and murder. In each episode, he is put to the test, debating the evidence and solving the human case. His ways may be out of the norm and sometimes against the  Hospital and/or AMA policies, but in his so-called madness (or genius) there are  reasons, he fights for the patientsThe show's writing is sharp, witty and filled with social commentary and  deep personnel, moral and medical issues. The show  discussing both sides of medical  issues, which is rare in a medical show-that makes this show uniqueThis program  has a truly great cast which meshes  well together. The talented cast including such notable actors as  Omar Epps (who remember me of Eric LaSalle from ER) and Sean Leonard among others and well as Laurie.House is not your  most atypical of medical  shows...it is thought provoking., which is why is worth  watching and is addictive.

914965,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B0009WPM1Q,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[13, 16]","I've got one big complaint about HOUSE that I must mention. I work in the medical field and one thing is glaringly missing from this otherwise excellent series: ancillary staff. Where are the nurses, radiologists, and lab techs? Trust me, doctors DO NOT start their own IVs on patients, or run the CT machine, or draw blood, or process viral cultures. If they attempted to do all of this, there would be zero time spent on patient care.Hmpf! Okay, I've got that off my chest.Gregory House (Hugh Laurie) is who this series is about. He's a doc with a keen sense for disease. And he's also damaged goods. Years before the series even begins (and as the story progresses) we learn why Doctor House hobbles around on a cane. One of his thigh muscles infarcted (died) due to ischemia (blood and oxygen deprivation) thus killing off a lot of muscle tissue. This has hardened him as well as causing a lot of pain, which he quells by popping Vicodin as if they were M & Ms.The head of the hospital where he works (Dr. Cuddy played by Lisa Edelstein) forces Houseto work in the hospital clinic; something he loathes (""Oh look! A runny nose. How exciting!"") Obviously House feels this is beneath his skills as a disease specialist and this is very insightful into his character. Not only does it show the audience his uppity attitude but it also shows his amazing diagnostic abilities. He figures out pregnancies, sexually transmitted diseases, niacin toxicity, and even paranoid delusions in the blink of the proverbial medical eye. This might sound as if it would come off as completely ridiculous, but the writers of this show have given Doctor House such an excellent persona that it comes off being completely believable.Although I had problems with the glaring omission of ancillary staff, the producers of House made such a screwed up character with remarkable brainpower that I found myself completely engaged in the series. And although there are several holes in how things ""really happen"" in hospitals, I found myself sitting on the edge of my seat, waiting to see what barbed comments doctor House would throw out next at the clinic, at his staff, or at the hospital administrator (""I don't have a pain management problem. I have pain issues. Or maybe I do have pain management problems but I'm just too stoned not to realize it"" or ""She just ran six miles for the first time in years and her legs hurt. Hmm. I wonder what's causing that?"")As mentioned earlier, I work in the medical profession and part of the appeal of this series is that doctor House holds back nothing. He's completely, brutally, honest, which makes him both rare and unsettling. We in the medical profession would often LOVE to say some of the caustic things that come out of his mouth, but we hold back for fear of a) losing our job, and b) being sued back to the stone age.Even so, the writers of this excellent series have created a great character who makes us both cringe and laugh.",4,"Overly Doctor-centric, But Still Love The Show",1157932800,"09 11, 2006",2006,2961,"[""'ve"", 'got', 'one', 'big', 'complaint', 'HOUSE', 'must', 'mention', 'work', 'medical', 'field', 'one', 'thing', 'glaringly', 'missing', 'otherwise', 'excellent', 'series', 'ancillary', 'staff', 'Where', 'are', 'nurses', 'radiologists', 'lab', 'techs', 'Trust', 'doctors', 'DO', 'NOT', 'start', 'own', 'IVs', 'patients', 'run', 'CT', 'machine', 'draw', 'blood', 'process', 'viral', 'cultures', 'attempted', 'do', 'would', 'be', 'zero', 'time', 'spent', 'patient', 'care.Hmpf', 'Okay', ""'ve"", 'got', 'chest.Gregory', 'House', 'Hugh', 'Laurie', 'who', 'series', 'about', 'doc', 'keen', 'sense', 'disease', 'also', 'damaged', 'goods', 'Years', 'series', 'even', 'story', 'learn', 'why', 'Doctor', 'House', 'around', 'cane', 'One', 'thigh', 'muscles', 'infarcted', 'died', 'due', 'ischemia', 'blood', 'oxygen', 'deprivation', 'thus', 'killing', 'off', 'lot', 'muscle', 'tissue', 'hardened', 'as', 'well', 'causing', 'lot', 'pain', 'popping', 'Vicodin', 'were', 'M', 'Ms.The', 'head', 'hospital', 'where', 'Dr.', 'Cuddy', 'played', 'Lisa', 'Edelstein', 'forces', 'Houseto', 'work', 'hospital', 'clinic', 'something', 'Oh', 'look', 'runny', 'nose', 'How', 'exciting', 'Obviously', 'House', 'feels', 'skills', 'disease', 'specialist', 'very', 'insightful', 'character', 'Not', 'only', 'show', 'audience', 'uppity', 'attitude', 'also', 'amazing', 'diagnostic', 'abilities', 'out', 'pregnancies', 'sexually', 'transmitted', 'diseases', 'niacin', 'toxicity', 'even', 'paranoid', 'delusions', 'blink', 'proverbial', 'medical', 'eye', 'might', 'sound', 'would', 'come', 'off', 'completely', 'ridiculous', 'writers', 'show', 'have', 'given', 'Doctor', 'House', 'excellent', 'persona', 'off', 'being', 'completely', 'had', 'problems', 'glaring', 'omission', 'ancillary', 'staff', 'producers', 'House', 'made', 'screwed', 'up', 'character', 'remarkable', 'brainpower', 'found', 'completely', 'engaged', 'series', 'are', 'several', 'holes', 'how', 'things', 'really', 'happen', 'hospitals', 'found', 'sitting', 'edge', 'seat', 'waiting', 'see', 'what', 'barbed', 'comments', 'doctor', 'House', 'would', 'throw', 'out', 'next', 'clinic', 'staff', 'hospital', 'administrator', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'pain', 'management', 'problem', 'have', 'pain', 'issues', 'maybe', 'do', 'have', 'pain', 'management', 'problems', ""'m"", 'just', 'too', 'stoned', 'not', 'realize', 'just', 'ran', 'six', 'miles', 'first', 'time', 'years', 'legs', 'hurt', 'Hmm', 'wonder', 'what', 'causing', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'work', 'medical', 'profession', 'part', 'appeal', 'series', 'doctor', 'House', 'back', 'nothing', 'completely', 'brutally', 'honest', 'rare', 'unsettling', 'medical', 'profession', 'would', 'often', 'LOVE', 'say', 'caustic', 'things', 'come', 'mouth', 'hold', 'back', 'fear', 'losing', 'job', 'b', 'being', 'sued', 'back', 'stone', 'age.Even', 'so', 'writers', 'excellent', 'series', 'have', 'created', 'great', 'character', 'who', 'cringe', 'laugh']",N/A

It is however not a one-man show and Laurie's co-stars all do a very good job playing his subordinates, friend(s), and colleagues, but especially Lisa Edelstein as House's boss Lisa Cuddy is worth of much applause.The stories are interesting and fascinating, very well written, and well played. There's just enough medical jargon to make it seem expertly confusing and realistic, yet not boring the viewer to tears.

Not in the way as a teenager would describe it in the way of being cool or just generally entertaining, but brilliant as in genius. I could talk about season one for hours as it's truly the season that defines the character and sets in stone Hugh Laurie's cracking of America. Hugh Laurie, for those who don't know is a famous British comic actor best known for his work with Stephen Fry. Such shows as Jeeves & Wooster, A Bit of Fry & Laurie & Blackadder made this man a true comic god. Upon hearing that Hugh had taken up the role as the American Dr. Gregory House, I'm sure a lot of people took a big sigh and said to themselves ""Oh, please god no."" How wrong those people were when Laurie stepped onto the screen in the pilot episode, with that incredible accent and the inclusion of his comic wit.The Story? Well the show is based around Dr. Gregory House, a medical genius is the head of a team of diagnosticians who specialise in solving those medical cases other doctors just can't figure out. House isn't the conventional Dr, however, because he's rude, selfish and doesn't like to follow the rules. He sets himself the task of curing his patient and makes sure he does just that. Whether that means sending his team to break into the patients home to see if the condition was taken in by the environment or not. Also House doesn't see the harm in interrupting a surgery to save his patient by spitting on the surgeon himself. If I were to have some criticism about the first season of the show it would be the character Vogler. Vogler becomes the hospitals chairman of the board after donating $100 million to the hospital. Vogler begins to throw his weight around as he wants to run it like a busines with clinical trials, rather than a hospital. This becomes a problem for House as his department eats a lot of the hospitals funds and saves only one person per week. The two characters immediately clash and Vogler sets on his own mission to get rid of House. The criticism I have is that from the very start of Season one every character has a certain chemistry with each other which helps the show blend together much better. I didn't see that chemistry with the Vogler character and for the episodes he was a part of it, it really dragged the show down. Don't let this put you off though as he's only in the show for a few episodes.This is just the first season but the drama and the characters aren't the only things that make this show unique. The dialogue is spectacular and I have no doubt in my mind that Laurie has some input about some of the classic one liners. Below are a few of my favourites.From Episode 3: Occam's Razor:House: ""Hello, sick people and their loved ones! In the interest of saving time and avoiding a lot of boring chitchat later, I'm Doctor Gregory House; you can call me ""Greg"". I'm one of three doctors staffing this clinic this morning.""Cuddy: ""Short, sweet, grab a file.""House: ""This ray of sunshine is Doctor Lisa Cuddy. Doctor Cuddy runs this whole hospital, so unfortunately she's much too busy to deal with you. I am a board ... certified diagnostician with a double specialty of infectious disease and nephrology. I am also the only doctor currently employed at this hospital who is forced to be here against his will.That is true, isn't it? (to Cuddy)But not to worry, because for most of you, this job could be done by a monkey with a bottle of Motrin. Speaking of which, if you're particularly annoying, you may see me reach for this: this is Vicodin. It's mine! You can't have any! And no, I do not have a pain management problem, I have a pain problem ... but who knows? Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I'm too stoned to tell. So, who wants me? ""From Episode 5 Damned If You Do:Nun: ""Sister Augustine believes in things that aren't real.""House: ""I thought that was a job requirement for you people.""From Episode 9 DNR:Wilson: ""So your philosophy is, 'If they don't want treatment, they get it shoved down their throat, but if it might cure their paralysis, whoa, better slow down'.""House: ""Yeah.

Everyone has pretty much said all there is to say about this season already, since the the double-sided disc set for season one has been out for four years. I hadn't seen the arc with billionaire Edward Vogler that runs from midseason until about two episodes prior to the end of the season. He gives the hospital one hundred million dollars with the condition that he be made chairman of the board. Vogler thinks that the problem with medicine is that it is not run like a business, and he sets out to run it that way. Thus he and the tenured House quickly find themselves at cross purposes. Indeed, Vogler cannot easily get rid of House, but he can threaten his untenured staff, and it is interesting to see the two spar.At the end of the season House's ex-girlfriend Stacy resurfaces with an ill husband in tow, asking House's help to diagnose and cure her husband. The husband is not only combative - he at first denies there is anything at all wrong with him - he also has all of the se x appeal of the Stay Puffed Marshmallow Man. She had to have married this guy on the rebound and furthermore he has to have known that. This rather unbelievable triangle plays itself out in season two.Seeing the episodes in order I did realize I had seen several of them before, including the pilot. What impressed me was that at the time I saw it I didn't realize it was the pilot, or necessarily even in the first season. That's one thing that really impresses me about this show - from the beginning of the series the players are completely in character. House being assigned to clinic duty in the hospital - a task he most reluctantly takes on - allows the opportunity for short funny cases to break up the bigger mystery of the one large case that dominates each episode, and really keeps things going.As for the packaging, this season was originally on dual sided discs, and that made for easy scratching and even some problems on some discs that showed no signs of scratching, so be aware that these dual sided versions are all over the place if you decide to purchase this season used.

914979,A314QIDIT0IS9Q,B0009WPM1Q,Charles M. Lee,"[3, 3]","Many reviewers of this product bemoaned the quality of the picture on the DVD. I am reviewing the show itself and not the quality of the DVD.It is my opinion that commercial television and creativity are - for the most part - mutually exclusive. Modern television doesn't want you to think, it wants you to buy the products - and viewpoints - it sells. Thus creativity is often shelved for ""what works"". What works being what will draw the masses. Because of this,  the same old tired stories are recycled over and over under the guise of being new. In this setting of mediocrity and muddiness it is a miracle that a show will emerge that is truly artful and creative. That show is House.I had given up on television before someone insisted that I watch an episode of ""House"". Reluctantly - everyone is always pitching their favorite shows to me telling me how ""different"" they are - I agreed to watch an episode. I became an immediate fan. Gregory House is one of the great characters in American Fiction. This is not the stereotypical ""good guy"" doctor. House brings the anti-social cynicism and gruffness of a street weary cop into the hospital. He is not the over used mythical ""rugged American Individual"", he is a damaged personality who hides behind his intellectual brilliance. This is television - or any other kind of writing - at its best. Here is a character that on the surface seems aloof and unconcerned but deep inside is more vulnerable than anyone can imagine. Kudos to the writers. This character has depth, and must be a challenge to write. The writers negotiate that thin border of making a character a jerk, but one that the audience can like and even relate to. Great job.House is really a cross genre show. It is Sherlock Holmes with a gurney. Instead of chasing Moriarty, our hero - each week - pursues the most baffling diagnostic challenges. The bad guys are not criminal master minds, but microbes that seek to kill their human hosts. The clues are not bloody knives, or ballistics , but rather symptoms of maladies that are hard to pin point. Yet week after week our hero, and his trusty sidekicks find them. The great thing is, that while pursuing the answers for his patients, House is also being forced to examine himself. Each time he is invited to lower his defenses and open up. Yet, House manages to remain House. He has the arrogance of Holmes and yet he is quite vulnerable when we are provided a glimpse behind his shield.The dynamic between House and his team further shows the talent of the writers. This is not a show about a well oiled machine working to perfection. This is a show portraying dysfunctional relations that manage to get the job done in spite of themselves. Sort of like most of us. The team members are often at odds with each other, and all must endure the mind games and calloused curt remarks of House. This makes for intense drama, and the addition of hospital politics and patient quirks makes for some intriguing plot twists. It is true a lot of shows attempt to portray functional dysfunction, but they fall short because their characters only two dimensional to start with. All of the characters in this show are well thought out and carefully developed. Each week you will find yourself - through the interaction of the characters - reevaluating your sense of what is right and wrong in some difficult situations. This is far from the mindless - we exist merely to sell products - nonsense that pervades modern television.The acting is as good as any on television today.

It has brilliant writing, great stories, and an amazing cast lead by the incredible Hugh Laurie.What's it about?""House, M.D."" is about a brilliant doctor (named ""House"") who treats patients with ailments that other doctors have failed to cure.  House is aided in his search for what is wrong with his patients by a skilled team of doctors.  Among the more interesting cases are people suffering from hepatitus, rabies, and a tape worm.While the medical cases are facinating, the heart of the show is Hugh Laurie's performance as Dr. House.  Dr. House is brilliant and damaged in soul and in body.  He walks with a limp caused by muscle death in his leg.  This ailment combined with his natural propensity for sarcasm make Dr. House a grumpy and blunt man who is not afraid to say what he thinks.

I am also the only doctor currently employed at this hospital who is forced to be here against his will. That is true, isn't it?

914983,AQCQ5F0OJXMG9,B0009WPM1Q,Crystal Starr Light,"[1, 1]","Okay, so there's a ton of medical dramas out there.  What could possibly make this one stand above the rest?Everything!House MD is a series centered at Princeton Plainsboro Teaching Hospital.  Dr. Gregory House, the shows titular character played by Hugh Laurie, is a caustic, rude, arrogant, and a million other nasty adjectives diagnostician and head of the diagnostics department.  Doctors Cameron, Chase, and Foreman are in his team.  Together (well, mostly), they will determine what no one else has determined, discover what is ailing patients, mostly by uncovering the careful lies patients create around their lives.The first thing you have to love about House is House.  Hugh Laurie plays Dr. House to perfection.  You hate to love this guy and love to hate this guy.  One minute, you feel sorry for him, the next, you want to strangle his insensitivity for patients and their families.Next, comes supporting cast.  Lisa Edelstein, Jennifer Morrison, Jesse Spencer, Omar Epps, and Robert Sean Leonard are convincing, intriguing characters.  Their reactions to House, to the patients, and to the cases.Then the cases.  While I don't understand a lot of the medical jargon, it definitely shows the powers that be put time and effort to make the diagnosises sound good and the cases challenging.The first season focuses a lot on the characters.  We learn that House has had an infarction on his right leg, causing him great pain and leading him to an addiction to Vicodin--one that is almost encouraged because the drug enables him to work.  Dr. Cameron was married at one time; Dr. Chase doesn't have a good relationship with his father, and Dr. Foreman had unusual jobs in the past.Aside from numerous sexual remarks and some really icky medical scenes that are sure to make the squeamish green (and not with envy), there is nothing to bash about this series.  Put it on your shelf and in your DVD player and enjoy!!  You won't regret it.EPISODE GUIDE:Look out for guest appearances for people like Elizabeth Mitchell, Robin Tunney, and Brandy!""Pilot"" - A grade school teacher collapses.  Excellent introduction, you are pretty much dropped right into the episode (there isn't an obvious introduction like House joins Princeton Plainsboro, or a new member was hired or something crazy) 5/5""Paternity"" - A teenager has night terrors.  I love how you see House at the end, on the lacrosse field!  5/5""Occam's Razor"" - Brandon passes out while AHEM with his fiancee.  I love the simple solution and how House scours the pharmacy. 4.5/5""Maternity"" - A plague scours the hospital that attacks the newborns.  This one isn't particularly one of my favorites, but it is creepy and chililng.  3.5/5""Damned If You Do"" - A nun comes in with a rash and develops something far worse.  I love Elizabeth Mitchell, I love learning more about Chase, and I adore the whole medical mystery! 5/5""The Socratic Method"" - A schizophrenic mother develops a blood clot which causes her to collapse.  I enjoyed how the child did so much to care for his mom AND hearing one of Hugh Laurie's British voices (his Wooster voice). 5/5""Fidelity"" - A woman becomes violent when her husband tries to get her out of bed.  This one was terribly sad, showing how tough marriage is.  4.5/5""Poison"" - A boy passes out during a caculus exam.  I found it freaky, to think that such chemicals could be on clothes.  4/5""DNR"" - A jazz musician passes out during a recording session.  I adored how House broke DNR, resuscitated the man, and was charged with assault.  5/5""Histories"" -  A homeless woman has a seizure at a rave.  I can't tell you how sad this one is.  4/5""Detox"" - A teenager who was in a car crash is still bleeding.  This is the episode that cements House's addiction and how he refuses to give up his addiction.  Plus, I adored the crazy diagnosis!!  5/5""Sports Medicine"" - A baseball player, formerly a drug addict, is hospitalized after his arm fractures violently.  In this episode, we see a glimpse of the extent that House will go for his friend, Wilson (the expensive Monster rally tickets).  4.5/5""Cursed"" - A young boy is found ill not long after sneaking into a house and playing with an Ouiji board that spells his death.  We learn more about Chase and his father, Dr. Chase.  4.5/5""Control"" - A CEO experiences leg pain while conducting a meeting.  This is the introduction of Vogler, and shows that House will indeed lie for his patients.  4.5/5""Mob Rules"" - A witness collapses while being protected.  Vogler starts becoming a pain, which is slightly annoying.  4/5""Heavy"" - An overweight girl has a heart attack while jump roping.  This episode really resonated with me, as I was always that last girl running during PE.  Not fond of Vogler's increasing bullish-ness.  4.5/5""Role Model"" - Black presidential candidate throws up on a man during one of his campaign dinners.  I love this one, particularly now, after Obama has been elected!  Smallville fans might recognize the president as Dr. Hamilton.  4.5/5""Babies & Bathwater"" - A pregnant woman collapses when a police officer pulls her over for drunk driving.  This one is so bittersweet!  The Vogler angle was much; I couldn't believe his manipulation of the board.  3.5/5""Kids"" - After an outbreak of meningitis at a swim meet, a young diver exhibits meningitis symptoms...but doesn't have meningitis!  I enjoyed the frenzied atmosphere, how Lisa Cuddy kept trying to get Chase, Foreman, and House to work checking for symptoms of meningitis. 4/5""Love Hurts"" - A young man in the waiting room of the clinic has a stroke.  Cameron returns and has her only date with House and we get a sneak peek of someone from another TV series from the 60's & 70's! 4.5/5""Three Stories"" - House teaches a seminar on diagnosing, involving three stories of leg injuries.  This is my absolute favorite episode; you beebop between three cases, one of which is House's!!  5/5""Honeymoon"" - Stacy gets House to treat her new husband, Mark.  We get to see House bounce off the only woman who can keep him at bay and get a hint of how much he still loves her.  4.5/5Episodes you can't miss:  Pilot, Paternity, Damned If You Do, The Socratic Method, DNR, Detox, and Three Stories.Brought to you by*C.S.

House, in his own way will ""rarely"" ever say it (or show it) but he does care for them and his circle of friends and in his own sort of backwards harsh way, Teaches to get his team to Think on their own, make their own decisions and to not let certain things get them off the path of what is the core problem.  Yes, House is a puzzle solver, and the last 10 minutes of his realizations are always great, whether it is Wilson who inspires him and gives him that last puzzle piece, or Cuddy, or something on one of his favorite Soap Operas.

It's certainly a heck of a lot better than Grey's Anatomy or Scrubs (Don't even get me started on that show...)! Hugh Laurie, playing Doctor Gregory House, is a phenomenal actor, not just in dramas like House MD but in his own British comedy bits as well (See: A Bit Of Fry and Laurie).Yes, he's British. I know, he doesn't have an accent in the show. Cool, huh? That just goes to show you how talented he is!I never knew a man could look better with stubble than clean-shaven, but those big baby-blue eyes and tan skin just doesn't look right perfectly shaven. He is a terribly gorgeous man.House's sarcasm and wit will keep you watching, smiling, even laughing. He's charming and attractive... who could ask for more?There are other handsome actors on this show as well, besides Laurie. Jesse Spencer, a beautiful, blond Australian actor, plays Doctor Robert Chase, a young blossoming doctor who is certainly not a character with too much backbone when it comes to standing up to House. However, being that House is right so often, he doesn't really have to stand up to him.Robert Sean Leonard (who you may remember from the extraordinary movie Dead Poet's Society) plays Doctor James Wilson, House's best friend. He is certainly a charming character and actor as well. He is House's check and balance, because in everything House does, he is always questioning it and trying to bring in another perspective. He is a very human character, though, and for all his moral ruminations, we still see his flaws... he is a bit of a Don Juan. House, who seems to have a huge problem with cheating, is always questioning him regarding his faithfulness to his wife, and that certainly does help as so much of modern entertainment doesn't put much stock in the sanctity of a marital relationship.Well, this is getting really long, isn't it? I guess going character-by-character isn't working too well.Alright. It's a great show, and the characters are, mostly, really great too.

Invariably, the team is racing the clock to save the patient.  House spars endlessly with his boss, medical administrator Dr. Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) over his lack of manners, his rules-breaking, and his failure to perform clinic hours.  House also imposes endlessly on Dr. Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard), his one friend on staff, who is often Watson to House's Sherlock Holmes.The show succeeds as a medical drama, but the real draw is watching Hugh Laurie walk a knife-edged line as an actor, playing a hughly unlikeable person whom the audience ends up rooting for anyway.

And the off set interviews with the other stars of the show are surprising. A few of the characters off screen seem to be polar opposites of their on screen personas.The extras were, however, my main quibble with the box set. There are not all that many of them and they do not dig too deeply into the scientific and medical content of the show, what I see as one of it's strengths.I read somewhere that ""House M.D."" was in part inspired by the book ""The Medical Detectives"" by Berton Roueche. It would be wonderful if sometime in the future, perhaps in a future box set, if the producers would reward House's loyal fans with a documentary on the science and medicine of House M.D. How about it?

Like all shows, the story lines can seem a bit far fetched if you know anything about practicing medicine (the chance of that one hospital seeing all of the rare conditions they see is slim to none), but then again, the stories are so interesting and engaging, you'll hardly notice! Hugh Laurie is purely flawless as Dr. Gregory House, and the dialogue is written perfectly to portray his strengths. He delivers every line with perfectly executed humorous sarcasm. You'd never know he was British from watching the show! The supporting cast is also excellent. This is the only TV show I always watch, and never miss an episode of.

He blends a perfect balance of sarcasm and compassion to his character. In every episode we see his genuine concern for the well-being of his patients, despite his often caustic and bitter attitude. He's a character facing many inner conflicts, and that's what makes him real. Although many of us don't understand a lot of the medical terminology used, we understand his motivations for doing what he does, even if it means going against the grain of the other doctors' opinions.All in all a terrific show.

I don't totally dislike the show, but I lean mostly in that direction.It's about Gregory House: A gruff man with a damaged right leg and a cane, in denial of his Vicodin addiction, who's a likely mentally-ill doctor with antisocial behaviour and a God-complex. He's had trouble in his personal and family life and deals with things by trying to solve patients' medical problems that others supposedly beneath him can't -- all while being a total jackass (which comes naturally and is nothing he struggles with). He loves only himself, only wants to help a patient when there's something unique or interesting/mysterious about symptoms so it's not 'boring', never cares if he upsets anyone, believes he's never wrong and tries to rationalize how it's someone else's fault when he is wrong, and tries his best to never have any interaction with any patient. Sounds like a great character and cheery viewing, right?His crassness is surely not hidden when he's basically made to have one-on-one time with a patient at the walk-in clinic. He's always trying to get out of that. This specifically reminds me of people I've dealt with. My experiences were horrible, but in different ways. For one example, House uses a portable video game system and ignores you. Mine told me that my reading a book by a doctor about my epilepsy condition was ""bulls***"" (but I bet House probably did that to someone in another episode).Concerning the show, I appreciate the unusual cases but it's just not enough for me. Now, I don't need to hear anything about how a reader would rather have a competent doctor with a crappy attitude then the alternative. I believe still that it is possible to have both; I hope they exist. In my experience, which has been extensive, there aren't as many of those and, fortunately, nobody's been as bad as doctor House. Certain ones have been close, causing harm to my mental health and violations of HIPAA rights, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and imagine that they haven't done it weekly to multiple patients. I have made my complaints without reservation against others and successfully proclaimed the incompetence of humanity in the 'helpers'. It's really a shame.See ""The Doctor"" with William Hurt or read the non-fiction ""A Taste Of My Own Medicine"" (which the movie was based on) to hear of a doctor who learns to be a better practitioner by understanding what patients go through and that it's okay to be human with them. Someday, the callous doctors will encounter their own and maybe feel regret for their own behaviour.Still on the air as of April 2012, we're at the final season for HOUSE. I haven't watched television programming, besides DVDs due to word-of-mouth, in at least a decade. I have no interest in watching anything beyond the second HOUSE season I am borrowing from the library at the moment unless I hear that Dr. House became a somewhat better doctor by becoming more human and having some character growth. . .but I assume that hasn't happened or else it would have been off the air years ago. It should have been over after the first season. It would have been alright for a few TV movies, perhaps, but as a series I think it's rather tame and disappointing.Again, I'm not a fan. Would I have been if I hadn't encountered rude doctors so many times over the years? Perhaps...but then again, Dr. House is just a jerk anyway and who would be fond of them? To me, I could never give this show a great rating because of my past and present. Loving the show would be like if I was a lifetime criminal reviewing and describing how much I enjoyed COPS; it wouldn't make sense. Doctors have been bad to me in reality, so I'm not quick to enjoy a show featuring them or hospital facilities...and one with doctors quick to violate patient rights and just cause harm? That's a no-brainer.Many shows are hits because viewers can relate to someone on the show or an aspect of it. As a person who could somewhat relate to this, in that I've had crappy doctors, it never will be liked. Let's hope that it didn't become popular because many people just love being able to identify with the terrible attitude of the House.I hear there's supposed to be a 'medical consultant' present (perhaps plenty of people with medical backgrounds to help with plots), but -- as to be expected for dramatic effect on TV -- there are falsifications. As a person with epilepsy, I hated that it seemed like in almost every episode there seemed to be a person with a seizure. They do not always hit a person immediately and are NOT always life-threatening as the public is led to believe. They are dangerous when, during a 'grand mal' (where you lose consciousness), the afflicted would be in a harmful area (like on the steps) or if the episode stops but then starts again repeatedly. That would be known a status epilepticus and is serious. Now, even if a 'grand mal' looks scary, the person's not in pain and not every seizure requires a hospital visit. The first-aid is to merely get the person to a safe location...put them on their side...wait for it to finish...and stay with them until they are back to normal. If they are hurt or if the episode isn't ending, then it's time to get them to a hospital.The stupidest representation of a seizure was one where this patient had an 'absence' seizure, which was the term the doctor used. He said it in a way like the person was dying. They made a big deal of it with the dramatic music followed by emergency procedures. There's nothing that needs to be done! Absence seizures almost always occur in children and are so minor that even the person who has one might not even know it. You just space out and are 'absent' for a moment or so. They could happen dozens and dozens of times a day. Teachers at school frequently let parents know that a child is not paying attention in class and it might be from such a condition.The final episode of the season, where Dr. House basically experimented and made this patient take a mixture of drugs to see what would happen was offensive. He was mentioning right to the patient that he couldn't do anything to stop him because he was paralyzed. The patient didn't want it and House's assistants, who were all there, knew that. They even stood in the doc's way to prevent him. House did a little distraction and ended up injecting the 'cocktail' anyway. The patient had a horrible reaction and almost died, but this showed that House was right and the correct cure was begun. We're supposed to cheer the doctor? Sure it's TV, yet is just makes me more disgusted at the 'sick care' system. Shame on all of the assistants for not helping in bouncing House's a$$ right out of his little domain.Also, how about the frequent times when a member or member(s) of House's team illegally break into the homes of patients to find clues to possible cures? Scary & ridiculous! Neither House or his assistants should be a part of any persons' care.In closing, I'll say HOUSE has a few well-written episodes. I have had some laughs, but as a whole it's a pretty-depressing show that's even caused me to be angry and offended at times. Many of the episodes are just dull and the formula is too similar over and over.House is a horrible character and his inner residence requires a thorough cleanup.",2,this House needs a

915012,A391AS877NJKUB,B0009WPM1Q,"G. Smith ""Egghead""","[2, 2]","My god, I love this show.If you've read any of the other reviews, you already know what it's about.  Be forewarned, it doesn't reinvent the wheel.  Each episode follows a formula and has a pretty clear theme to it.  The forumla works, though, and it follows a pretty logical progression: people go to a hospital because they are not well.  Dr. House senses something amiss in each episode's particular patient that no one else notices (because he's the best) and their condition worsens.  There's trial and then error until an answer is found.  Sound familiar?  Yeah, that's how medical cases tend to work outside of TV as well.  The difference is, in House, people learn life lessons along the way that are passed on to the viewer.The writing is very entertaining.  It's not the most subtle wit - life would be frustrating if everyone spoke like in Deadwood - but it's leagues above shows like Smallville.  You will laugh and, hopefully, you will feel little rips in your heart in a few of the more touching episodes.  Overall, it's very sardonic, honest, funny and dramatic.The acting is truly top notch.  The main character, Dr. Gregory House, is superhumanly good at what he does and subhumanly offensive at times, but that only matters because Hugh Laurie does such a fantastic job of portaying him.  Take as a testament to his skill some of the lower score reviews that lambast the character as being rude and offensive.  If all you want is a nice, safe, warm and fuzzy show where everyone ""good"" is likeable and the main characters get along, go elsewhere.  The characters in House are, though not entirely realistic, not paragons of virtue.  The actors all let the characters' flaws shine through as well as most other shows polish and groom their stories for simple minded family viewing, so much so that some viewers are rubbed the wrong way.  Could bad actors do that?

I get glued to it whenever it's on.So I thought the DVD would be the perfect thing for me to enjoy this show intravenously whenever I wanted.Unforutnately, this DVD is a let down in some ways:1 A) NOT optimized for 16x9 screens.1 B) The show is actually better in 4x3!The slightly narrower framing of the regular 4x3 TV frame seems to be much more suited for this show. The wider framing seems to make the characters so much more lonely and isolated, away from each other than I thought they were when I watched the show when it was on TV. The tighter feeling of the 4x3 frame makes the relationships much more on edge and stifling, making it seem as though they have to confront each other that much more. The 16x9 seems too loose, the characters do not seem to be as engaged with each other. Don't get me wrong, it is pretty to look at in many ways, but the wider frame disengages me from the moment too much in this show, especially when we need to be in close and moving with the characters and their emotional moments.2) The 5.1 channel audio is NOT suited for the show - a 2.0 stereo mix for TV screens would have been better. For some reason, because the sounds are TOO clean from the 5.1 channel mix, it is easier to notice the mistakes in the sound levels from dialogue to dialogue and actor to actor. You can clearly hear the attempts made to make the sound edits seem more seemless, but unfortunately, the 5.1 mix isolates the tracks so well that the ambient sounds drown the dialogue and makes the whole show sound very ""canned"" and un-realistic to the point where in some scenes, there is not enough background sounds of commotion and the buzz we come to expect from a hospital show such as ""ER.""  I think a straight 2.0 mix for an overlaid broadcast-type sound for TVs, without all the separate speakers, would have created a much more immediate and realistic feel to the show.

However, I happen to tune in when this show premiered last year, and have to say I really enjoyed every episode of Season 1. House MD should not really be described as a medical drama, which sounds like another E.R. type show. House MD is more like a medical comedy with a serious twist. I love Dr. House for his truly entertaining personality. He is a smart-alleck who happens to be right most of the time. He is the ""go against the grain"" type doctor who does not care for the daily stupidity of hospital politics and avoids doing any clinic work at all costs. His relationships with his employees as well as his boss really makes the show. When you add the actual medical part into this mix, what you get is House MD, a truly enjoyable medical show that touches a wide audience.

Relying on his unconventional methods and the three fellows under his tutelage, House (Hugh Laurie) regularly cracks difficult cases that other doctors would have given up long ago.Ironically enough, the one patient House couldn't save is himself. Six years ago, he suffered an infarction in his thigh, undergoing a dangerous surgery in an attempt to save his life. While House did survive, he was left with constant pain -- causing him to pop Vicodin like candy, walk with a serious limp, and become filled with even more bitterness than he began with.Added to that, House is antisocial and always thinks outside the box; as one of his fellows once said, ""He doesn't even know where the box is."" Introspective and much too frank, House is a loner, except for the friendship of Dr. James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard), a young oncologist who also works at Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital, and their boss, dean of medicine Dr. Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein).Despite the verbal abuse and eccentricity that House brings, his three fellows -- Drs. Robert Chase (Jesse Spencer), Eric Foreman (Omar Epps) and Allison Cameron (Jennifer Morrison) all know that he's one of the best there is, and working with him for a few years will guarantee them their choice of jobs once they're ready to work unsupervised. Who else but House, after all, would think of checking a young nun's uterus for a long-ago hidden birth control device?

A product of Eton and Cambridge (which almost by definition makes him an upper-class twit), he's a considerable athlete, having rowed in the Oxford v. Cambridge boat race, a talented musician who plays multiple instruments and sings the blues and one of Britain's best-known comedy actors. Like most people who knew his work before House, I was amazed to see him in this part. I associated him primarily with Blackadder and Jeeves and Wooster, in both of which he actually played an upper-class twit. Yet here he is, not only playing an ascerbic misanthrope, but an American one!However, what his lighter work has given him is a wonderful sense of timing. He delivers House's zingers with great relish and doesn't rush the lines- this is one of the best-paced shows on TV, with the pauses often meaning as much as the words. Laurie also brings out the bitterness and underlying sensitivity of his character by subtle expressions and inflections. It helps that he has the bluest eyes since we lost Paul Newman. It's a brilliant performance that never gets stale.He's helped by being surrounded by a magnificent cast, headed by Lisa Edelstein, Omar Epps and Robert Sean Leonard. They are the perfect foils for House's eccentricities and convey their frustration with and admiration for the rogue doctor perfectly. If Jennifer Morrison and Jesse Spencer, as his junior colleagues, aren't quite as strong, it's only because the bar is set so high.The stories are formulaic, but it's an interesting formula. The supply of rare diseases for House to figure out seems inexhaustible! Around the essential center of each episode, a mysterious ailment which House and his colleagues must diagnose and treat before the patient dies, there are various sub-plots involving House and his colleagues in some way, usually demonstrating House's disregard for convention and cynicism about human fallibility (an early proposal for the series name was 'Everybody Lies'). The various patients' personal lives and those of House's colleagues also provide a rich source for drama. Almost every episode has a touching moment, often when House's better nature shows through the irascible outer crust. Laurie somehow manages to make the character both the biggest jerk you would ever have the misfortune to meet and a sympathetic figure at the same time.This is both the funniest and most moving program on TV at present. This first series shows why, and it's one that can be watched over and over.

915043,A2MZ1VBYTQ7MO5,B0009WPM1Q,Joseph Haggard Jr.,"[3, 5]","I've never been the biggest fan of dramatic medical shows, but over the years I've watched several shows that take place at hospitals. Some of these shows include: ""ER"", ""Chicago Hope"", ""St. Elsewhere"", and (more recently) ""Grey's Anatomy"". Just two months before ""Grey's Anatomy"" hit the airwaves on ABC, ""House, M.D."" premiered on Fox. After watching a few episodes this season, I found it to be a very interesting series. So I picked up the complete first season on DVD, watched all 22 episodes, and now I'm hooked.""House, M.D."" may be the best medical series I've ever seen. And while ""ER"" and ""Grey's Anatomy"" are good medical shows, I never got as hooked on to those shows as I have with ""House, M.D."" This is a great show that follows the adventures of Dr. Gregory House, a very smart and brilliant doctor who's also very arrogant and sarcastic. Here's a doctor who (despite his brilliance) isn't very nice to anyone, including his patients. Thanks to a painful leg, he has to walk around with a cane (which reminds me a lot of the Laura Innes character from ER, Dr. Kerry Weaver) and is constantly popping pills throughout each day to make the leg as less painful as possible. Dr. House has a team of young medical experts who get together and try to figure out the diagnosis of patients who come into their hospital after falling mysteriously and severely ill.Each episode is brilliantly written and directed, and the acting by its cast is phenomenal. British actor Hugh Laurie is a powerhouse as Dr. House, displaying a type of acting that I rarely see on television. He delivers his dialogue in an occasionally fast-paced unique way, and (despite coming from Britain) he doesn't even sound British (if you watch the bonus features on the DVD, you'll notice that when Laurie talks during the interviews he sounds very British). Dr. House is very much American, and Laurie has brought this character wonderfully to life. I don't think any other actor could do this great of a job in this role as Laurie has done so far. What also makes Dr. House such a memorable character is that even though he's very angry and very serious most of the time, he provides plenty of darkly humorous moments. Much of the humor occurs when he's constantly arguing with his boss, hospital administrator Dr. Lisa Cuddy, who's well-played by Lisa Edelstein. Dr. Cuddy hates House and would like nothing more than to fire him because of his rudeness towards everybody as well as the serious risks that he takes when it comes to saving a patients' life, but at the same time she keeps him on the hospital staff because she respects him, primarily because she knows deep down that he's very smart and knows exactly what to do when it comes to treating a very sick patient. Edelstein is excellent, and so is the rest of the supporting cast that make up Dr. House's team. Robert Sean Leonard (all grown up since starring in the 1989 Oscar-nominated Robin Williams movie Dead Poets Society) portrays Dr. James Wilson, who seems to look up to House as kind of a father figure; Omar Epps is Dr. Eric Foreman, the African-American doctor who occasionally has issues with Dr. House's medical methods; Jesse Spencer plays Dr. Robert Chase, the handsome young doctor from Australia who (like Dr. Foreman) tries to outguess House when it comes to figuring out what's wrong with each patient; and Jennifer Morrison portrays Dr. Allison Cameron, the beautiful young female doctor who kind of has a crush on the cranky Dr. House. All of these actors are superb in their roles, and I hope that all of them will get Emmy nominations before the show ends its run.Speaking of Emmy nominations, ""House, M.D."" did receive 5 nominations for its first season, including one for Hugh Laurie as Best Actor in a Drama Series (which he probably deserved to win; James Spader instead won for ""Boston Legal""). The show did win a Emmy in its freshman year for Best Writing in a Drama Series, which went to the show's creator David Shore for writing the next to last episode titled Three Stories, a great episode in which we find out exactly why Dr. House has that pain in his leg and is forced to walk around with a cane everyday. Also, Bryan Singer (director of Superman Returns and the first two X-Men movies) serves as an executive producer of the show as well as directing the first and third episodes of season one (he also makes a cameo appearance in front of the camera in an episode midway through the season as a TV commercial director).""House, M.D."" is a spectacular show that has become a big hit for Fox, and deservedly so.",5,"House, M.D. -

It had to grow on me, as I did not instantly warm up to the main character, Dr House...at least, not at first. He seemed egotistical, downright rude and pretty offputting.I also couldn't figure out (at first) if this show was a medical drama, medical mystery (kind of like the CSI of diseases) or a character-driven series. Turns out it is all three, along with some of the best one-liners on television, the kind of dialogue that made me chuckle in surprise, when I wasn't laughing out loud at the humor and cleverness of the writers.After I  stuck with the first couple of episodes,that was it...by then, I'd become a true addict of the show, alternately fascinated and repelled by ""House,"" a doc who is a true rebel but one with enough genius to be (barely) tolerated by his patients and associates.Then there is the medical info, which is always interesting, especially since the show uses a the technique where viewers see very authentic interior views of bodies as they react to diseases, medicine and lifesaving techniques. If you're squeamish about such things, be forewarned.This show dares to push the envelope and you may find yourself hard-pressed to understand why ANY hospital would keep a doc like House around, someone who seems to be a major liability, upsetting patients and using unorthodox techniques (and ""unorthodox"" is putting it lightly). He should have standing appointments with legal counsel and he generally pops into the hospital's legal administrator once or twice an episode. Luckily, she maintains some grudging affection for him.House's associates, beleagured and badgered as they are by him, are also good counterpoints to his intense, often ""over the top"" persona. They reflect the world of the normal, something House can only glance at from a distance, being so far from normal that it is probably only a speck in the distance, if he even perceives normality at all.What truly keeps House from being overly irritating are signs that his enormous ego and incredible rudeness mask some deep insecurities and even some sensitivity. Could he actually be a romantic at heart? Or is that just another manipulative guise of his, one of many he uses as needed (ethics isn't his strong suit).Each episode is far from predictable. Just when I think I have the ""formula"" for the show figured out, they throw a curve ball, whether it is introducing Sela Ward as a possible love interest, ramping up the chemistry between other characters or watching House 'treat"" a patient by hitting him with his cane in....well...some very sensitive areas. He even befriends a rat just before his cane comes down on the animal, simply because the rat tips his head, a tipoff to some peculiar biochemistry that may tie in with another patient's diagnosis. It is these odd little moments that help make the show a standout.",4,Goes far beyond ANY medical dramas on tv today - ER this is NOT!,1132876800,"11 25, 2005",2005,2874,"['really', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'show', 'first', 'had', 'grow', 'did', 'not', 'instantly', 'up', 'main', 'character', 'Dr', 'House', 'least', 'not', 'first', 'seemed', 'egotistical', 'downright', 'rude', 'pretty', 'offputting.I', 'also', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'first', 'show', 'was', 'medical', 'drama', 'medical', 'mystery', 'kind', 'CSI', 'diseases', 'character-driven', 'series', 'out', 'three', 'best', 'one-liners', 'television', 'kind', 'dialogue', 'made', 'chuckle', 'surprise', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'humor', 'cleverness', 'writers.After', 'stuck', 'first', 'couple', 'episodes', 'was', 'then', ""'d"", 'become', 'true', 'addict', 'show', 'alternately', 'fascinated', 'repelled', 'House', 'doc', 'who', 'true', 'rebel', 'one', 'enough', 'genius', 'be', 'barely', 'tolerated', 'patients', 'associates.Then', 'medical', 'info', 'always', 'interesting', 'especially', 'show', 'technique', 'where', 'viewers', 'see', 'very', 'authentic', 'interior', 'views', 'bodies', 'react', 'diseases', 'medicine', 'lifesaving', 'techniques', ""'re"", 'squeamish', 'such', 'things', 'be', 'forewarned.This', 'show', 'push', 'envelope', 'may', 'find', 'hard-pressed', 'understand', 'why', 'ANY', 'hospital', 'would', 'keep', 'doc', 'House', 'someone', 'who', 'be', 'major', 'liability', 'upsetting', 'patients', 'using', 'unorthodox', 'techniques', 'unorthodox', 'putting', 'lightly', 'should', 'have', 'standing', 'appointments', 'legal', 'counsel', 'generally', 'hospital', 'legal', 'administrator', 'once', 'twice', 'episode', 'Luckily', 'grudging', 'affection', 'him.House', 'associates', 'beleagured', 'badgered', 'are', 'are', 'also', 'good', 'counterpoints', 'intense', 'often', 'top', 'persona', 'reflect', 'world', 'normal', 'something', 'House', 'can', 'only', 'glance', 'distance', 'being', 'so', 'far', 'normal', 'probably', 'only', 'speck', 'distance', 'even', 'normality', 'all.What', 'truly', 'House', 'being', 'overly', 'irritating', 'are', 'signs', 'enormous', 'ego', 'incredible', 'rudeness', 'mask', 'deep', 'insecurities', 'even', 'sensitivity', 'Could', 'actually', 'be', 'romantic', 'heart', 'just', 'manipulative', 'guise', 'one', 'many', 'needed', 'ethics', ""n't"", 'strong', 'suit', '.Each', 'episode', 'far', 'predictable', 'Just', 'when', 'think', 'have', 'formula', 'show', 'figured', 'out', 'throw', 'curve', 'ball', 'introducing', 'Sela', 'Ward', 'possible', 'love', 'interest', 'ramping', 'up', 'chemistry', 'other', 'characters', 'watching', 'House', ""'treat"", 'patient', 'hitting', 'cane', '.well', 'very', 'sensitive', 'areas', 'even', 'rat', 'just', 'cane', 'down', 'animal', 'simply', 'rat', 'head', 'tipoff', 'peculiar', 'biochemistry', 'may', 'tie', 'patient', 'diagnosis', 'odd', 'little', 'moments', 'help', 'make', 'show', 'standout']",N/A

I brushed it off because it never seemed that interesting to me. Recently she retrieved this 3-Dual Sided Disk set from some relatives and forced me to watch it. What a serious mistake I have been making by not watching this.House, played by the genius Hugh Laurie, is an amazing doctor. He works for a walk-in hospital. House has a horrible limp and needs a cane to walk. That aspect will be further explained through later episodes in the season. He is also the best doctor available at the hospital. However, his outrageous behavior often gets him yelled at by patients and the hospital owner, Dr. Cuddy. This outrageous behavior includes forcing patients into treatment, asking patients crazy questions, and only picking up cases that seem interesting to him. Dr. Cuddy decides to fix this problem by giving House many hours of clinical duty to deal with normal patients in between the interesting ones.The first eight episodes run a normal routine. You are introduced to House and his team of medical experts, each with their own unique characters. Each episode will feature a new patient with a problem. House and his team will go through many different diagnoses before they figure out what is actually wrong with the patient. This always remains interesting with the use of seizures, vomiting, and other disgusting events. House will be providing comedic relief along the way.Still, once these initial eight episodes are over you will begin to get tired of this same routine. Luckily, episode nine breaks away from the routine. While the first couple of episodes did a good job of establishing characters, the episodes that follow them create dynamic characters. House's history is revealed in a wonderful episode that you have no idea is even about him. House is one the verge of being fired. House goes on a date with his co-worker named Cameron. There is so much evolution of the already beautifully created characters.The extras are some making of features and two extras talking about the character House. These are all nice extras, but nothing too great. The DVD is set up really well though. Each episode is given a summary before you begin watching. That way even if you do not remember the name of the episode, you can find the episode you are looking for. This is probably the best set-up DVD Set I own.If you want dynamic character, intense and deep storylines, and comedy that does not take away from the effect, then check out House. The dynamic characters will keep you watching this until the great season finale.

If the show continues on its present path it may never leave the air.HOUSE (AKA ""HOUSE M.D."") concerns the antics of the brilliant, incisive, completely cynical, vicodin-addicted Dr. Gregory House, who works at Princeton University Hospital as Chief of Diagnostic Medicine. He has a covey of extraordinarily bright and ambitious students. He has a boss, Dr. Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein), with whom he trades barbs and the occasional leer. Cuddy is usually irritated at House because of his rude and dismissive attitude toward other doctors, patients, hospital staff, administrators, and the Board of Directors, but she defends him to the utmost, realizing that he is a brilliant doctor. House's best friend is Dr. Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard), Chief of Oncology, whom he frequently shanghais into assisting with cases.All the characters have depth, wit, intelligence, and verve. HOUSE rarely misses a beat. The writing is crisp and stiletto sharp. This is a very adult-oriented show.House is a despiser of political correctness, and often capsizes preconceived notions with a turn of phrase:TO AFRICAN-AMERICAN DOCTOR:  ""You! Get away from that whiteboard!  Hey, it's not MY rule.""orWILSON: ""I don't like semantics.""HOUSE: ""Why, you Anti-Semantic S.O.B!""He also enjoys making not-very veiled references to Cuddy's anatomy or his students' sex lives.Hugh Laurie is an English actor who plays the American House without a trace of an accent. When he screen-tested for the part he showed up, did his lines, and left. After he was hired, he came to work speaking ""English""; the producers wanted to know why he was putting on the accent. THAT'S how good he is.House walks with a cane. Partially paralyzed from an accident, he has become a pill-popper. This isn't a secret. In later seasons he's forced to confront his paralysis and addiction.If HOUSE has a single flaw, its the fact that each week the patients suffer from ridiculously complex symptoms, which send House and his team on a scavenger hunt of tests and procedures to discover the cause of why Margie had a headache which is gone, but then her fingers turned green, after which she had trouble breathing, and then her hair fell out, leading to the discovery of an undescended testicle, and that's why her name's really Mitch. Just once, I'd like somebody to show up with a cold.But the game's afoot . . . HOUSE is very consciously patterned on Sherlock Holmes in which House = Holmes and Wilson = Watson.

915051,ASSCA9IS0GWF5,B0009WPM1Q,Laszlo Matyas,"[3, 3]","There's enough good stuff here to make House a truly brilliant television show- we've got stunning characters, an excellent balance of comedy and gritty realism, strikingly original plots, excellent dialogue, and first rate acting. The show works because it steers clear of the cliche and melodrama that threatens to plague most of its peers, keeping its focus on compelling, original storytelling and characterization. Indeed, this show has one of the greatest protagonists I've ever seen, on television or otherwise. Dr. Greg House, diagnostician extroirdenaire, is a complex, brilliant, utterly striking and mysteriously likable human being. Emotionally stunted, fiercely single-minded, and unquestionably bitter, he's a thousand miles away from the handsome, cookie-cutter caricatures that infest the average T.V. drama. A striking and mysterious persona, House occupies the realm of the hardboiled creations of Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett. He's medicine's Sam Spade, a solitary and seemingly detached figure who hides behind his sarcasm and sneer, solving seemingly impossible puzzles and saving countless lives as a matter of compulsion rather than an apparent effort to help people. Despite his jokes and deflections, his actions are colored by bitterness, pain, and jealousy. Compelling stuff. The supporting characters are fantastic as well- there's House's best friend and confidante, the witty and compassionate Dr. James Wilson, whose unique ability to read and reason with the notoriously inscrutable doctor is just plain fun to watch. There's House's boss, Dr. Lisa Cuddy, who, along with Wilson, is just about the only person who can keep up with House's cutting wit and rapid-fire deductions. He's also got a team of three skilled young doctors ( Drs. Cameron, Chase, and Foreman) with their own complexities, strengths, and weaknesses.The show's originality is rooted in its ability to turn cliches and expectations inside-out. For example, House himself is a seemingly paradoxical character study: his misanthropic and seemingly amoral tendencies (he has no qualms about lying to and manipulating his friends, employers, and patients in order to get his way), as well as his grim view of human nature and apparent lack of concern for those placed in his care belie the fact that he works tirelessly to save the lives of his patients. He operates based on an unusual, but uncompromising sense of morality and justice.What makes it all come together is the acting and stories. Hugh Laurie leads the cast, portraying the title character with a seemingly effortless, utterly hypnotic sort of power. The stories themselves are varied and engrossing, deftly balancing medical mystery and dramatic action, introducing interesting characters and subplots (there's a fantastic five-episode arc in this season which sees House sparring with the megalomaniacal, charismatic billionaire Edward Vogler). In fact, this season's penultimate episode, ""Three Stories,"" is simply one of the greatest things to ever take place on a television screen.Anyone who's looking for a striking and original T.V. series that makes good on its premise should check this out.",5,Fox gets it right!,1195516800,"11 20, 2007",2007,3173,"['enough', 'good', 'stuff', 'here', 'make', 'House', 'truly', 'brilliant', 'television', 'show-', ""'ve"", 'got', 'stunning', 'characters', 'excellent', 'balance', 'comedy', 'gritty', 'realism', 'strikingly', 'original', 'plots', 'excellent', 'dialogue', 'first', 'rate', 'acting', 'show', 'clear', 'cliche', 'melodrama', 'plague', 'most', 'peers', 'keeping', 'focus', 'compelling', 'original', 'storytelling', 'characterization', 'Indeed', 'show', 'one', 'greatest', 'protagonists', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'television', 'otherwise', 'Dr.', 'Greg', 'House', 'diagnostician', 'extroirdenaire', 'complex', 'brilliant', 'utterly', 'striking', 'mysteriously', 'likable', 'human', 'being', 'Emotionally', 'stunted', 'fiercely', 'single-minded', 'unquestionably', 'bitter', 'thousand', 'miles', 'away', 'handsome', 'cookie-cutter', 'caricatures', 'infest', 'average', 'T.V', 'drama', 'striking', 'mysterious', 'persona', 'House', 'realm', 'hardboiled', 'creations', 'Raymond', 'Chandler', 'Dashiell', 'Hammett', 'medicine', 'Sam', 'Spade', 'solitary', 'seemingly', 'detached', 'figure', 'who', 'sarcasm', 'sneer', 'solving', 'seemingly', 'impossible', 'puzzles', 'saving', 'countless', 'lives', 'matter', 'compulsion', 'rather', 'apparent', 'effort', 'help', 'people', 'jokes', 'deflections', 'actions', 'are', 'colored', 'bitterness', 'pain', 'jealousy', 'Compelling', 'stuff', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', 'fantastic', 'well-', 'House', 'best', 'friend', 'confidante', 'witty', 'compassionate', 'Dr.', 'James', 'Wilson', 'unique', 'ability', 'read', 'reason', 'notoriously', 'inscrutable', 'doctor', 'just', 'plain', 'fun', 'watch', 'House', 'boss', 'Dr.', 'Lisa', 'Cuddy', 'who', 'Wilson', 'just', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'can', 'keep', 'up', 'House', 'cutting', 'wit', 'rapid-fire', 'deductions', 'also', 'got', 'team', 'three', 'skilled', 'young', 'doctors', 'Drs', 'Cameron', 'Chase', 'Foreman', 'own', 'complexities', 'strengths', 'show', 'originality', 'rooted', 'ability', 'turn', 'cliches', 'expectations', 'inside-out', 'example', 'House', 'seemingly', 'paradoxical', 'character', 'study', 'misanthropic', 'seemingly', 'amoral', 'tendencies', 'qualms', 'lying', 'manipulating', 'friends', 'employers', 'patients', 'order', 'get', 'way', 'as', 'well', 'grim', 'view', 'human', 'nature', 'apparent', 'lack', 'concern', 'placed', 'care', 'fact', 'tirelessly', 'save', 'lives', 'patients', 'based', 'unusual', 'uncompromising', 'sense', 'morality', 'justice.What', 'come', 'together', 'acting', 'stories', 'Hugh', 'Laurie', 'cast', 'portraying', 'title', 'character', 'seemingly', 'effortless', 'utterly', 'hypnotic', 'sort', 'power', 'stories', 'are', 'varied', 'engrossing', 'deftly', 'balancing', 'medical', 'mystery', 'dramatic', 'action', 'introducing', 'interesting', 'characters', 'subplots', 'fantastic', 'five-episode', 'arc', 'season', 'House', 'sparring', 'megalomaniacal', 'charismatic', 'billionaire', 'Edward', 'Vogler', 'fact', 'season', 'penultimate', 'episode', 'Three', 'Stories', 'simply', 'one', 'greatest', 'things', 'ever', 'take', 'place', 'television', 'screen.Anyone', 'who', 'looking', 'striking', 'original', 'T.V', 'series', 'good', 'premise', 'should', 'check', 'out']",N/A
915052,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0009WPM1Q,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[12, 13]","What became clear to me as I watched Season One of ""House, M.D.,"" is how the show walks a tightrope.  There are few shows on television that are as formulaic as this one, where a patient with an unknown medical malady is brought into the hospital and Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie), an infectious disease specialist, has to figure out the medical puzzle to save the patient from dying.  Working with his team of young doctors, House spends most of a typical episode eliminating possibilities, which is a nice way of saying he is usually the wrong diagnosis until the final act.  For example, in ""Fidelity"" a woman is brought in dead asleep and everything from tumors to breast cancer to rabbit fever is considered before House pulls African sleeping sickness out of his hat.Obviously, if House walks in and is able to make the diagnosis much earlier than that, then they do not that much of a story.  Still, there are episodes where the diagnosis is arrived at early on and the dramatic concern is getting the patient (or the hospital, etc.) to accept the treatment.  In ""Fidelity"" the problem ends up being that somebody has to admit to having an affair to confirm the diagnosis.  A better example of this type of episode is ""DNR,"" where a legendary jazz musician is diagnosed as dying from ALS and House violates the DNR order to save the man's life.  But even these variations on the theme ultimately just show how dominant the formula is here.What makes ""House"" work is that the central character is so compelling, which is why my favorite episode is ""Three Stories,"" which is the one that is most about House, even though he pretends it is not.  House is a brilliant diagnostician but he is also rude, acerbic, and condescending in the extreme (and that is one a good day).  I was thinking that House is one of those colorful characters, like Columbo or Monk, who has their own unique way of doing what they do, except that House is not as loveable.  But then I have to admit there is something rather attractive about somebody who does not put up with the rules when they get in the way, who takes pleasure in finding interesting ways to insult people to their face, and who is able to get away with everything because he is so good at what he does.But I got tired of Columbo after a few years and House is more like Monk in providing a supporting cast for the title character to play against.  In terms of his team of clinicians they are all on House's bad side to begin with because they are young and inexperienced, but each is presented as pushing a particular button for House: Dr. Allison Cameron (Jennifer Morrison) is female, Dr. Eric Foreman (Omar Epps) is black, and Dr. Robert Chase (Jesse Spencer) provides a double dip by being both rich and English.  Not that House has a prejudicial bone in his body (just the bad one in his leg and a need to get under people's skin).  Dr. Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) rubs House the wrong way because she is (technically) his boss, but the chief fun there is bouncing back and forth between demeaning her as a doctor and as a bureaucrat.  Then there is Dr. James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard), who is literally House's only friend in the world on the strength of being able (and willing) to stand toe-to-toe and argue things out.The introduction of billionaire Edward Vogel (Chi McBride) as the clinic's new Chairman of the Board (""Control"") was an unnecessary major subplot in Season One because giving more system for a guy who bucks the system to buck is just overkill and adding obstacles that can only kill people gets old quickly.  Vogel's attempt to get House to fire one of his doctors (""Heavy"") was interesting because it revealed that his team are pretty interchangeable; for some reason I was thinking that it would make more sense if each had their own specialties, but then I decided that does not make sense, either in terms of how you treat an expert in infectious diseases or having writers understand who is responsible for what in each script.Another thing that Season One proved is that House's romantic life is not in the present, but in the past.  Cameron's attempt to force a date with House (""Love Hurts"") was painful, while the arrival of ex-flame Stacy Warner (Sela Ward) for the last two episodes simply proves House's sex appeal is as man of mystery.  Hints that there might be an actual human being behind that facade are all that are going to work, and as another person who knew House before he needed a cane, Warner allows a few more looks behind the mask.  The main thing is that the writers have as much fun coming up with nasty things for House to say as Laurie has declaiming them with an American accent.",5,Hugh Laurie's Dr. House makes deadly diseases fun again,1131494400,"11 9, 2005",2005,4695,"['What', 'became', 'clear', 'watched', 'Season', 'One', 'House', 'M.D.', 'how', 'show', 'tightrope', 'are', 'few', 'shows', 'television', 'are', 'as', 'formulaic', 'one', 'where', 'patient', 'unknown', 'medical', 'malady', 'brought', 'hospital', 'Dr.', 'Gregory', 'House', 'Hugh', 'Laurie', 'infectious', 'disease', 'specialist', 'figure', 'out', 'medical', 'puzzle', 'save', 'patient', 'dying', 'Working', 'team', 'young', 'doctors', 'House', 'most', 'typical', 'episode', 'eliminating', 'possibilities', 'nice', 'way', 'saying', 'usually', 'wrong', 'diagnosis', 'final', 'act', 'example', 'Fidelity', 'woman', 'brought', 'dead', 'asleep', 'everything', 'tumors', 'breast', 'cancer', 'rabbit', 'fever', 'considered', 'House', 'African', 'sleeping', 'sickness', 'hat.Obviously', 'House', 'able', 'make', 'diagnosis', 'much', 'earlier', 'then', 'do', 'not', 'much', 'story', 'Still', 'are', 'episodes', 'where', 'diagnosis', 'arrived', 'early', 'dramatic', 'concern', 'getting', 'patient', 'hospital', 'etc', 'accept', 'treatment', 'Fidelity', 'problem', 'up', 'being', 'somebody', 'admit', 'having', 'affair', 'confirm', 'diagnosis', 'better', 'example', 'type', 'episode', 'DNR', 'where', 'legendary', 'jazz', 'musician', 'diagnosed', 'dying', 'ALS', 'House', 'DNR', 'order', 'save', 'man', 'life', 'even', 'variations', 'theme', 'ultimately', 'just', 'show', 'how', 'dominant', 'formula', 'here.What', 'House', 'work', 'central', 'character', 'so', 'compelling', 'why', 'favorite', 'episode', 'Three', 'Stories', 'one', 'most', 'House', 'even', 'not', 'House', 'brilliant', 'diagnostician', 'also', 'rude', 'acerbic', 'condescending', 'extreme', 'one', 'good', 'day', 'was', 'thinking', 'House', 'one', 'colorful', 'characters', 'Columbo', 'Monk', 'who', 'own', 'unique', 'way', 'doing', 'what', 'do', 'House', 'not', 'loveable', 'then', 'have', 'admit', 'something', 'rather', 'attractive', 'somebody', 'who', 'not', 'put', 'up', 'rules', 'when', 'get', 'way', 'who', 'pleasure', 'finding', 'interesting', 'ways', 'insult', 'people', 'face', 'who', 'able', 'get', 'away', 'everything', 'so', 'good', 'what', 'does.But', 'got', 'tired', 'Columbo', 'few', 'years', 'House', 'more', 'like', 'Monk', 'providing', 'supporting', 'cast', 'title', 'character', 'play', 'terms', 'team', 'clinicians', 'are', 'House', 'bad', 'side', 'begin', 'are', 'young', 'inexperienced', 'presented', 'pushing', 'particular', 'button', 'House', 'Dr.', 'Allison', 'Cameron', 'Jennifer', 'Morrison', 'female', 'Dr.', 'Eric', 'Foreman', 'Omar', 'Epps', 'black', 'Dr.', 'Robert', 'Chase', 'Jesse', 'Spencer', 'double', 'dip', 'being', 'rich', 'English', 'Not', 'House', 'prejudicial', 'bone', 'body', 'just', 'bad', 'one', 'leg', 'need', 'get', 'people', 'skin', 'Dr.', 'Lisa', 'Cuddy', 'Lisa', 'Edelstein', 'rubs', 'House', 'wrong', 'way', 'technically', 'boss', 'chief', 'fun', 'bouncing', 'back', 'forth', 'demeaning', 'doctor', 'bureaucrat', 'Then', 'Dr.', 'James', 'Wilson', 'Robert', 'Sean', 'Leonard', 'who', 'literally', 'House', 'only', 'friend', 'world', 'strength', 'being', 'able', 'willing', 'stand', 'toe-to-toe', 'argue', 'things', 'out.The', 'introduction', 'billionaire', 'Edward', 'Vogel', 'Chi', 'McBride', 'clinic', 'new', 'Chairman', 'Board', 'Control', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'major', 'subplot', 'Season', 'One', 'giving', 'more', 'system', 'guy', 'who', 'system', 'buck', 'just', 'overkill', 'adding', 'obstacles', 'can', 'only', 'kill', 'people', 'old', 'quickly', 'Vogel', 'attempt', 'get', 'House', 'fire', 'one', 'doctors', 'Heavy', 'was', 'interesting', 'revealed', 'team', 'are', 'pretty', 'interchangeable', 'reason', 'was', 'thinking', 'would', 'make', 'more', 'sense', 'had', 'own', 'specialties', 'then', 'decided', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'either', 'terms', 'how', 'treat', 'expert', 'infectious', 'diseases', 'having', 'writers', 'understand', 'who', 'responsible', 'what', 'script.Another', 'thing', 'Season', 'One', 'proved', 'House', 'romantic', 'life', 'not', 'present', 'past', 'Cameron', 'attempt', 'force', 'date', 'House', 'Love', 'Hurts', 'was', 'painful', 'arrival', 'ex-flame', 'Stacy', 'Warner', 'Sela', 'Ward', 'last', 'two', 'episodes', 'simply', 'House', 'sex', 'appeal', 'man', 'mystery', 'Hints', 'might', 'be', 'actual', 'human', 'being', 'facade', 'are', 'are', 'going', 'work', 'person', 'who', 'knew', 'House', 'needed', 'cane', 'Warner', 'few', 'more', 'looks', 'mask', 'main', 'thing', 'writers', 'have', 'as', 'much', 'fun', 'coming', 'up', 'nasty', 'things', 'House', 'say', 'Laurie', 'declaiming', 'American', 'accent']",N/A

IT REALLY KEEPS THE SHOW INTERESTING. THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE CHARACTERS IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT, DYNAMIC AND WELL DEVELOPED I THINK. THE STORIES ARE ALSO WELL WRITTEN, WELL ACTED, AND WELL DEVELOPED IN MY OPINION. I FIND EACH CASE FASCINATING AND I LOVE TO WATCH AS EACH ONE UNRAVELS.

915059,A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B0009WPM1Q,"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t...","[9, 9]","There are plenty of hospital shows out there - I'm sure we could name 10 of them off the tops of our heads without even trying. Some are soap operas, some are gritty medical issues. With House, it's more like a detective show. They try to figure out from the clues what the obscure disease is. They even go digging through the homes for clues.In some medical shows you have the ""stupid doctors"" going up against the ""wise doctors"", and some slutty nurses thrown in for excitement. House does a wonderful job of appealing to a much more alert audience. Pretty much every character is smart, wise and caring. They all just have different ways of showing it, and different personalities. House and his three minions are all very intelligent, and want to help their patients. They have human emotions too, and those sometimes poke into their world.First seasons are almost always about ""character setting"" - giving all the background information on each character so you understand their dimensions, learn how they relate to each other. House is no exception. You get an episode a person, pretty much - each of the main characters ""brings in"" a patient and that episode helps you learn more about the person.The show definitely goes for ""shock value"" at times. There's been talk about how ""throwing up"" is the new shock visual, and they certainly know that in this show. They also like seizures - there seem to be quite a lot of them. They look for medical situations that will make the audience react, like sticking needles into peoples' eyeballs.I don't want to get into episode specifics, since that ruins the enjoyment of watching the solving of the mystery. They try to touch on ""important issues"" like teen sexuality, newborn babies, the right of the pregnant mom vs the right of the unborn child. There's a lot of sex-related issues, but you sort of expect that in a mature-aimed show.One of the episodes that stood out for me as a valiant attempt was about obese people - several threads on the show talked about how people automatically treat heavy people as being ""wrong"" or ""ugly"" and how they should just be accepted. It was a great idea - but then how they resolved the issues were a bit questionable. I think they could have done better here.A key plot element of this show is that ""House is Grumpy"". He's not just a nasty person - he is in intense pain because of a leg problem and this eats away at him. He tends to be rude to people, and they tend not to appreciate it. Still, his friends stick by him. One, his female employee, wants to date him. This also makes me very uncomfortable. Most workplaces have rules against employees dating the person who gives them reviews, for very obvious reasons. They should never have allowed an intelligent female doctor to pretty much immediately want to date her boss.Still, I love the series in general, and these are relatively minor quibbles. Well worth renting if not buying and watching repeatedly.Now, as far as the DVD goes, they did an AWFUL job - because each episode page gives the full details of that episode, giving away the secrets! You have to pretty much hide your eyes while you click on an episode so you don't have it ruined for you. Whoever did that should be scolded and forced to watch bad movies for 2 months in payment. Completely silly. The other extras - the behind the scenes looks, the talks with the actors, are short but fun.",5,"Fantastic dialogue, acting, very rewatchable",1166054400,"12 14, 2006",2006,3409,"['are', 'plenty', 'hospital', 'shows', 'out', 'there', ""'m"", 'sure', 'could', 'name', '10', 'off', 'tops', 'heads', 'even', 'trying', 'are', 'soap', 'operas', 'are', 'gritty', 'medical', 'issues', 'House', 'more', 'detective', 'show', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'clues', 'what', 'obscure', 'disease', 'even', 'go', 'digging', 'homes', 'clues.In', 'medical', 'shows', 'have', 'stupid', 'doctors', 'going', 'up', 'wise', 'doctors', 'slutty', 'nurses', 'thrown', 'excitement', 'House', 'wonderful', 'job', 'appealing', 'much', 'more', 'alert', 'audience', 'Pretty', 'much', 'character', 'smart', 'wise', 'caring', 'just', 'have', 'different', 'ways', 'showing', 'different', 'personalities', 'House', 'three', 'minions', 'are', 'very', 'intelligent', 'want', 'help', 'patients', 'have', 'human', 'emotions', 'too', 'sometimes', 'poke', 'world.First', 'seasons', 'are', 'almost', 'always', 'character', 'setting', 'giving', 'background', 'information', 'character', 'so', 'understand', 'dimensions', 'learn', 'how', 'relate', 'other', 'House', 'exception', 'get', 'episode', 'person', 'pretty', 'much', 'main', 'characters', 'brings', 'patient', 'episode', 'learn', 'more', 'person.The', 'show', 'definitely', 'shock', 'value', 'times', 'been', 'talk', 'how', 'throwing', 'up', 'new', 'shock', 'visual', 'certainly', 'know', 'show', 'also', 'like', 'seizures', 'there', 'seem', 'be', 'quite', 'lot', 'look', 'medical', 'situations', 'will', 'make', 'audience', 'react', 'sticking', 'needles', 'peoples', 'eyeballs.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'episode', 'specifics', 'enjoyment', 'watching', 'solving', 'mystery', 'try', 'touch', 'important', 'issues', 'teen', 'sexuality', 'newborn', 'babies', 'right', 'pregnant', 'mom', 'right', 'unborn', 'child', 'lot', 'sex-related', 'issues', 'sort', 'expect', 'mature-aimed', 'show.One', 'episodes', 'stood', 'out', 'valiant', 'attempt', 'was', 'obese', 'people', 'several', 'threads', 'show', 'talked', 'how', 'people', 'automatically', 'treat', 'heavy', 'people', 'being', 'wrong', 'ugly', 'how', 'should', 'just', 'be', 'accepted', 'was', 'great', 'idea', 'then', 'how', 'resolved', 'issues', 'were', 'bit', 'questionable', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'here.A', 'key', 'plot', 'element', 'show', 'House', 'Grumpy', 'not', 'just', 'nasty', 'person', 'intense', 'pain', 'leg', 'problem', 'away', 'be', 'rude', 'people', 'tend', 'not', 'appreciate', 'Still', 'friends', 'stick', 'One', 'female', 'employee', 'date', 'also', 'very', 'uncomfortable', 'Most', 'workplaces', 'have', 'rules', 'employees', 'dating', 'person', 'who', 'reviews', 'very', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'should', 'never', 'have', 'allowed', 'intelligent', 'female', 'doctor', 'pretty', 'much', 'immediately', 'want', 'date', 'boss.Still', 'love', 'series', 'general', 'are', 'relatively', 'minor', 'quibbles', 'Well', 'renting', 'not', 'buying', 'watching', 'repeatedly.Now', 'as', 'far', 'DVD', 'did', 'AWFUL', 'job', 'episode', 'page', 'full', 'details', 'episode', 'giving', 'away', 'secrets', 'have', 'pretty', 'much', 'hide', 'eyes', 'click', 'episode', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'ruined', 'Whoever', 'did', 'should', 'be', 'scolded', 'forced', 'watch', 'bad', 'movies', '2', 'months', 'payment', 'Completely', 'silly', 'other', 'extras', 'scenes', 'talks', 'actors', 'are', 'short', 'fun']",N/A

British comedian Hugh Laurie has proved me right.As a fan of British TV, I discovered the brilliant Hugh Laurie many years ago, actually doing justice to P.G. Wodehouse - no small feat - and was astonished to see him very unexpectedly show up one day playing an acerbic American doctor.  And since there is no better reason to watch a show than Laurie being in it, I watched.Despite the (excellently maintained) American accent, House is the type of character one sees more often in British TV than American - he is, in fact, almost exactly the medical equivalent of one of British TV's most popular detectives, Inspector Jack Frost (also played, not ironically, by a comedian, the utterly brilliant David Jason).  Perhaps this is why I was both so completely taken with the character of House, and completely comfortable with him.Hugh Laurie has found the perfect role for his wide range of skill as an actor - he is brash, angry, apathetic, deeply compassionate, even somewhat pitiful, and unbelievably funny (although I would love to hear that beautiful singing voice, and yes, that really is him playing the piano).  I am thrilled that a whole new audience - make that a whole new continent - has now discovered him.  Even for those who don't particularly like medical dramas, like me, Laurie is mesmerizing enough, and his character and relationships intriguing enough, that House is a must-watch.That being said, the show is not for the squeamish - some of the scenes are quite graphic and can be disturbing, and it is too frank to be appropriate for children.  Of course most jaded viewers will hardly notice.House fans unfamiliar with Laurie's previous work across the Atlantic really should taste and see what the comic genuis can do.  My personal favorite is season one of Jeeves and Wooster, especially fun if you want to see Laurie in a role that is in every possible way the exact opposite of House.Now for the nit-picky stuff: the DVDs are fairly cheesily produced, not, as other reviewers have mentioned, truly anamorphic, and double-sided, which won't win any awards. My set even has a defect and will have to be exchanged.  For the price they could have at least given us six well-made DVDs and a nice insert with descriptions of each episode.  The special features are great fun, but too short.The DVD set gets two stars.The show, and its star, get five.

915097,A2VODABWSVHV8E,B0009WPM1Q,"Ray ""A Reader""","[1, 1]","What can be said about a series that must certainly be ranked as one of the most compelling to have ever appeared on television? It is easy to view the slew of awards that House, M.D. has been nominated for (and won), to recall the litany of accolades the show has garnered from news, entertainment, and magazine critics, and even to review the endless series of online postings concerning the show (like this very one, here, on Amazon), and conclude that, ""Yes, House, M.D. is probably a good show."" But in fact, House, M.D. is more than a good show. For many viewers, the series is easily one of the most fascinating and unusual to have ever been aired on television. Moreover, and dare I say it, the series will likely eventually be ranked amongst the top television shows ever produced on network television.But before I say any more about House, MD., let me briefly for the reader summarize the show. House, M.D. is a medical drama that takes place at a fictional teaching hospital (""Princeton-Plainsborough Hospital""). The story revolves around a particular doctor, Dr. Gregory House, an individual who has established himself as a medical genius able to solve difficult medical mysteries that other doctors have been unable to solve. Dr. House works with a small group of internists who are serving in residence under him, and who, despite their much less experience, actively work with House to solve medical problems through a technique called a ""Differential Diagnosis,"" a kind of group-based brainstorming session where diagnostic ideas are presented, written on a white board, and systematically eliminated by comparing each hypothesis with the ongoing list of patient symptoms. But Dr. House is more than just a diagnostic genius: he possesses a debilitating leg injury that keeps him in perpetual pain, and he regularly uses powerful prescription painkillers to the point where there is genuine concern that he may, in fact, be a pain medicine addict. But there's more. Along with his genius, House has an incredibly insensitive and offensive demeanor, and seemingly has no concern for social norms, courtesies, or sometimes, even common decency. His unparalleled genius at helping patients is probably what keeps him employed in spite of his incredibly ongoing offensive behavior.What makes this show so compelling, so unique, and so interesting? There is probably no one answer to this question. At the core of it is likely House himself, a character who is fundamentally a contradiction, a walking incongruity, a person that we desperately and increasingly wish to understand, and perhaps, even wish to control to correct his unacceptable behavior. We find ourselves watching this man and so strongly wishing that we can figure him out, to come to a true understanding and belief about him, to solve the mystery of who he really is, and by that knowledge, settle the manifold open questions surrounding him and his relationships to others that each episode more fully presents.Unfortunately, or should I rather say, ""fortunately,"" such an understanding is not easily developed. The complexities, ambiguities, and open questions surrounding the character of House come tantalizingly close to being solved time after time, only to be later shown that what we thought was the answer to this man was really just another false lead, another misunderstanding, another fact to add into this increasingly difficult puzzle. Part of the show's allure is this ongoing dissonance, not only between House and his coworkers, but deeply within House himself. Is he truly an uncaring person? Is he truly a person who views his entire medical career as simply a series of puzzles to be solved, and where people who recover are simply a side effect of the solved puzzle? Does he really look at every social, religious, or ethnic factor as a legitimate target of derision? Is he truly hostile to people's religious convictions? Does he truly believe that his drug addiction is an irrelevant issue to his work? Each episode faces us with House's reaction to these questions to varying degrees, and over time, we may find that we build an increasing understanding of this man, but we often find those understandings torn apart in a later episode, where new observations on House make us rethink what we think we knew.In spite of House's problems and deficiencies, we often find him an imminently likeable character, and we often see hints of goodness in him that he desperately tries to keep hidden from others. Often, it is hinted in the subtilest of ways that House himself wishes to hide from others the fact that he truly does care, but this hint is just as quickly dashed as we witness his next immature toy kicking. (It can sometimes seem that House is more of a four year old in a nursery who is testing his fellow nursery members for territorial markers. In other cases, he is the genius child who seeks to use others as fodder for his most recent theories on human and animal behavior.)House, M.D., if the truth be known, does not start out in Season One as a soap opera, but by Season Five for the series run, I think a defensible case can be made that the show takes on many of the trappings of a soap opera, curiously and ironically enough, mirroring the very soap operas that the character House in the show is seen so frequently watching (often, on an old, 1990's style portable television located in his office). This morphing into the arena of the soap opera doesn't really matter, though, for the viewer who has gone through the entire set of previous episodes in order. With no attempt to defend this shift in style, the show uses its first three seasons to genuinely establish itself as a puzzle solving, medical mystery show, with House serving as a medical Sherlock Holmes (sans the hat and the pipe, but plus the strange personality and temperament issues), and the stories are easily carried with each individual episode standing as a mental gymnastic exercise that keeps the viewer wanting more. But strewn through these episodes are myriads of strange, and often, very awkward character interactions that are left unfinished and unexplored, tantalizing us with seeming keys to unlock the mystery of House. It is perhaps inevitable that a show lasting so many years (now in its sixth season) and having such strong characters and unusual trappings would be inevitably drawn to revisit and examine such unfinished business. These ""explorations"" begin to occur more repeatedly in Season Four, and by Season Five, we see the exaggeration of much of this at the expense of series' original, focal point of medical mysteries to be resolved, which by this point in the series often take back seat to the ever growing personal dramas. But even this doesn't matter. The issues and themes explored in Season Five, while taking on the feeling of a soap opera, are still handled with great expertise and generally fascinating ways, so that we still find ourselves focused on each event, all the time still (unconsciously at times, I must admit) wishing that we can figure House out, get the mystery of House solved, and have some type of a resolution that fits our conception of the real world. By the end of Season Five, we still do not have an answer for this dilemma, and the show uses this dilemma to hold the audience's attention in a powerful manner.The basic premise of the show is so startling unique and fascinating in its own right that the show does not need to rely on cheap ""shock"" tricks to maintain attention. It is true that there are a number of ""shocking"" events to occur through the series, and there can be no doubt that the show, being first and foremost a network based television format production, employs ""cliffhangers"" to hold the viewer through the regular commercial breaks, but it is amazing to see how the show is regularly worked into individual episodes that are artfully crafted into stories that flow, and work, from beginning to end.Quite some time ago, I wrote a long review for The Rockford Files, a television show in the 1970's that, in my own thinking, achieved the status as being one of the best television shows ever produced. I had written my review at a time when the first Rockford Files DVD's were being released, and the opportunity to re-watch these shows reminded me again of the superior writing, the acting, and the impressive interworking of the cast which made this show, not just a cut above the average television show, but a true classic, one that could almost not be challenged in the realm of television. I still feel that way about The Rockford Files, and, truth be known, another very different show from a decade earlier, The Dick Van Dyke Show, had many of these same characteristics, all coalescing to make what eventual became in both cases a classic production. The Rockford Files and The Dick Van Dyke Show reached such pinnacles of performance that they remain examples of the very best television ever made, and even the ravages of 30 and 40 years of time have done little but solidify that achievement.House, M.D. is, in my opinion, is likely destined for that same level of accolade. In the show, we find that same coalescing of features - a truly unique character creation, excellent writing, and a cast that works well together - that will argue for the show's inclusion in that highest level of ranking. But whether that specific claim turns out to be true or not, the fact remains that House, M.D. is one of the most fascinating, intriguing, and enjoyable shows to watch. We witness medical problems and the difficult procedure in diagnosing and treating those problems; we witness the struggles, oddities, and offensiveness (and yes, there are many parts of the show that are incredibly offensive) of a main character who remains both a genius and an enigma, an inscrutable person who is endlessly fascinating to behold; we witness a cast of actors who must earn to interact with the powerful character of House while establishing their own credibility; and finally, but not least of all, we enjoy Hugh Laurie's incredible rendition of the House character. Add these factors up, and you end up with one heck of a fascinating show. I'll say it in conclusion again, that this is one of the best television shows to have appeared in years, and Hugh Laurie is superb in his role as House. You can enjoy it even more on DVD, where there are no commercial interruptions. I rate this as five stars, but the real truth is that it is one BIG star (House) with four other stars with him. Well, make that seven or eight other stars, depending on the season you are currently watching.",5,Is There a Doctor in the House?

Murena Jr. ""tedmurena""","[3, 4]","I dont watch a lot of network television and even fewer medical dramas but I recently started watching House M.D. and cant get enough of it.  If you are like me this season one DVD is for you. House has something that all other medical dramas miss: great writing with outstanding actors.  Gregory House played by hugh Laurie is the genious head of a teching hospital who's skill and intellect is put to the test in each episode as his team treats patients with the most complicated of problems.  But he is certainly not like other doctors.  House looks like he just woke up after a three day bender and has bizarre habits that teeter on boarder of madness. With his quirky wry, sarcastic and just plain wierd personality he is butressed by a great supporting cast including Omar epps among others. This show has a truly great cast.  But for me the true stars of this show are the writers who combine brilliant sarcasm and high stress situations and deep personal issues into their hospital setting.  While the patients they treat definitely have atypical medical needs thats the reason they are assigned to the most atypical of doctors.The DVDs have great behing the seens footage and interviews with the cast.  Often I find these ruin the show once I can see beyond the camera shot but I truly found the cast to be endearing and I could easily tell how much Laurie enjoyed playing House MD.  So if you are new to the show or just cant get enough this set is for you.  With the entire first season you'll be able to immerse yourself in the ongoing stories and find that there is finally a truly great medical drama.Ted Murena",5,Finally an excellent mediical Drama that delivers Quality!,1140307200,"02 19, 2006",2006,1625,"['dont', 'watch', 'lot', 'network', 'television', 'even', 'fewer', 'medical', 'dramas', 'recently', 'started', 'watching', 'House', 'M.D', 'cant', 'get', 'are', 'season', 'one', 'DVD', 'House', 'something', 'other', 'medical', 'dramas', 'miss', 'great', 'writing', 'outstanding', 'actors', 'Gregory', 'House', 'played', 'hugh', 'Laurie', 'genious', 'head', 'teching', 'hospital', 'who', 'skill', 'intellect', 'put', 'test', 'episode', 'team', 'patients', 'most', 'complicated', 'problems', 'certainly', 'not', 'other', 'doctors', 'House', 'just', 'woke', 'up', 'three', 'day', 'bender', 'bizarre', 'habits', 'teeter', 'boarder', 'madness', 'quirky', 'wry', 'sarcastic', 'just', 'plain', 'wierd', 'personality', 'butressed', 'great', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Omar', 'epps', 'others', 'show', 'truly', 'great', 'cast', 'true', 'stars', 'show', 'are', 'writers', 'who', 'combine', 'brilliant', 'sarcasm', 'high', 'stress', 'situations', 'deep', 'personal', 'issues', 'hospital', 'setting', 'patients', 'treat', 'definitely', 'have', 'atypical', 'medical', 'needs', 'reason', 'are', 'assigned', 'most', 'atypical', 'doctors.The', 'DVDs', 'have', 'great', 'behing', 'seens', 'footage', 'interviews', 'cast', 'find', 'ruin', 'show', 'can', 'see', 'camera', 'shot', 'truly', 'found', 'cast', 'be', 'endearing', 'could', 'easily', 'tell', 'how', 'much', 'Laurie', 'enjoyed', 'playing', 'House', 'MD', 'So', 'are', 'new', 'show', 'just', 'cant', 'get', 'enough', 'set', 'entire', 'first', 'season', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'immerse', 'ongoing', 'stories', 'find', 'finally', 'truly', 'great', 'medical', 'drama.Ted', 'Murena']",N/A

Here Laurie plays Dr. Gregory House, a caustic but brilliant doctor who diagnoses the most impossibly difficult cases, frequently using ethically questionable means. House, himself addicted to Vicodin, is amazingly well defined, yet elusive as a character. On the surface, he seems easily predictable, especially when confronted with situations requiring conformity to convention, but when confronted with conflicting information (either medical or interpersonal) he becomes extremely volatile. These conflicts lead to some of the best drama in television history.The show is extremely well written, and is good at explaining obscure medical conditions to the audience in an unobtrusive manner, much like Ron Howard was able to explain the complexities of lunar spaceflight in ""Apollo 13."" The show is never condescending to the audience (though House frequently is onscreen), and allows all the characters to define themselves as independently strong people. I am especially pleased with the portrayal of a sensitive, yet funny, oncologist by Robert Sean Leonard. Leonard is Laurie's closest friend in the series, and watching their interaction is frequently funny but often heartfelt.The DVD has several worthwhile extras, including medical cases from the episodes, a set tour, and a casting session with Hugh Laurie, in which his true British accent is revealed for those who haven't seen his previous work.I wish all television could be this good.

915101,A3AD071UEP20WS,B0009WPM1Q,"Roger Long ""longrush""","[1, 1]","Dr. Gregory House M.D. is a first-class detective, but not one who is detecting murderers and other criminals.  The villains are all medical ailments, but the methodology is much the same.  At a New Jersey hospital, he is the chief of diagnostic medicine assigned to the most puzzling cases.House and Sherlock Holmes have much in common.  Sherlock was addicted to cocaine.  House is addicted to pain kiillers for a disability that has left him hobbling and using a cane.  Neither House nor Holmes is much interested in ingratiating himself to others.  In fact, House's bedside manner tends often to be downright insulting.  ""All patients lie,"" he says in the pilot episode.  But there is no substitute for competence and House is certainly most competent.  Would you not rather go to a doctor who was competent than to one who was very pleasant and didn't know Shinola when he saw it?  Even the names are similar:  House/Holmes.  One has to assume that was intentional on the part of the writers.Grey's Anatomy, ER and most other medical shows border on soap opera and often cross the line.  House M.D. doesn't.  It focuses on House's battles in getting past the rules and incompetence around him in his attempt to save lives.

915107,A2QDPJRVXL7P4F,B0009WPM1Q,"Sahra Badou ""Bibliophile""","[4, 4]","I do not usually review TV series, but I felt compelled to do so this time.House is just an amazing TV show. It is quite interesting to see how TV dramas based on medical themes have evolved in the last twenty-five years. First we had General Hospital, where patients wore full make- up in their hospital bed, and looked like they were modeling for Miss America during their sickness. Then other shows like ER were more realistic and captivated their audiences.House will not only captivate you but educate you as well. How do doctors know what is making you sick? How do they know what to test for in order to find the cause of your ailment? Are doctors always right in their treatments or can they be wrong?The main character in the show is Dr. House. He is not a very pleasant man. He does not like to meet patients, for he believes they all lie. He is arrogant and rude, and very impatient with his patients. He seems like a very unlikable character, but somehow, the viewer is apt to love him.As the episodes progress, we see more and more his humane side.Sometimes it is necessary to go to the patient's house in order to find out what ails him or her. For example, a woman brought to the hospital suffered seizures. At first, she was diagnosed as having a brain tumor. But treatment given to her was not working, but making her worse. Then doctors sent to her apartment found ham in her fridge; lots of it. Dr. House quickly guessed that it might be tape worm. A scan of her head showed a tape worm stuck in her brain. Removing the tape worm cured the problem. Now honestly, who ever knew that a tape worm could actually live in your brain?There are many interesting medical ailments that will both scare and amaze you. I think the writers did a great job in researching the different strange medical ailments that can suddenly hit us as if from nowhere.An African-black senator running for president collapses after a speech. In the hospital, a blood test showed that his white blood count was very low, and a rare fungus common to AIDS patients grew in his brain. Dr. House quickly determines that the cause of his seizures is HIV, and asks the lab to test for it. The test comes back positive and he is quickly put on an anti-viral intravenous treatment. However, the treatment makes him worse. Why? Is this a new HIV strain? The senator does not believe that he has AIDS, and tells Dr. House that he is not gay, and that he had only protected sex with two women since his wife's death. Dr. House knows that patients always lie, and besides, the senator's blood test came back positive for HIV. But at the same time, the anti-viral treatment is not only not working, but making the patient worse. What could possibly be the problem? What if the patient is telling the truth? What if the patient truly believes that he does not have AIDS, should this matter? Dr. House decides to do the unthinkable, and actually believes for the first time ever his patient. He runs another blood test for HIV, and behold, the test comes back negative. We are then told that 1 in 5,000 people tested for HIV will get a false positive result. In other words, the blood test will show that they have HIV when in fact they don't. Dr. House immediately stops the anti-viral treatment, and the process of finding out the cause of the senator's ailment is started anew. Pretty fascinating stuff!What do you do when all newly born babies in the hospital are born very sick? Obviously, something in the hospital is making them sick, but what and what treatment should you give to the babies? In that particularly touching episode, different treatments had to be used on different babies in order to see which treatment will work. Only one treatment will work, so the baby receiving the wrong treatment will die, and the others will live. How difficult such a situation is to a doctor? And should a doctor play God in deciding which baby should live and which should die? And is the death of a single baby justifiable when many other babies will be saved by sacrificing the one? Those are very ethical questions, but ones real-life doctors are faced with constantly. This episode will probably keep you awake at night.Sometimes a person suffers from two or more different viruses, bacterial, and/or fungal infections that acting together produce very confusing and fatal symptoms. Not all symptoms are a result of one disease, but might be a combination of two or more. The doctor must be like a detective in trying to single out the different diseases and determining a successful treatment or cure. In this show, disease is the bad guy, and doctors are the detectives trying to catch him.This show will teach you many medical terms. It will show how doctors arrive at the cause of the ailment through trial and error.This is really a fascinating and very educational show. Watching it is by no means a waste of time, but should be required viewing. Whoever said that watching TV is harmful to your health? One study I read recently showed that people who watched TV regularly are happier than people who don't. A recent statistic calculates that a person living in the US would have stayed in front of the TV screen 15 years by the time he reaches 60. Watch TV programs that educate at the same time as they entertain and you'll be ahead of the couch potato syndrome.One thing is for sure. We will all find ourselves in a hospital bed sometime during our lifetime. It is nice to be informed ahead of time what it can be like, and that doctors are human after all. Maybe some time in the near future we will have computers connected to the internet on our beds in hospitals, where we can research on our own what ailment we could possibly have. After all, who better knows his or her body more than the patient?",5,Educational show!,1186704000,"08 10, 2007",2007,5796,"['do', 'not', 'usually', 'review', 'TV', 'series', 'felt', 'compelled',

915111,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,B0009WPM1Q,Sean Pasek,"[4, 4]","Every once in a while, an actor is able to take a character and make him/her uniquely his/her own.  They are also able to make this character so appealing that no one can soon forget them.  This doesn't happen as often as one might think.  I can think of a handful, from Leonard Nimoy's Mr. Spock, to Henry Winkler's Fonzy, to even more recently with William Petersen's Gil Grissom.  Hugh Laurie most definitely must be placed in this community of actors for their performances.Gregory House is not your typical doctor with a ""lovely"" bedside manner.  If anything, he's the opposite.  He almost sticks his nose up at those who make bad decisions or people who just aren't very bright when the answer is clearly staring them in the face.  He has an almost vicious contempt for these people, whether they be fellow doctors or patients.  You might then ask, ""then why is he even remotely appealing?""  Because, the flip side to House is that he does care, even if he will never admit that he does.  He's much like a wounded child.  His only pleasure comes from playing video games on his hand-held Gameboy or watching ""General Hospital,"" his favorite TV show.  If there's a funny line to be said, even if it's a mild insult, Gregory House will say it without a second's thought.  Anyone who has seen Hugh Laurie in other roles, especially in ""Sense and Sensibility"" can easily see him in this role of Dr. House.  I cannot emphasize enough how good his is.  As good as the supporting cast is, Hugh manages to steal virtually every scene he's in.You might think that House M.D. is just another ""doctor show.""  You would be wrong.  Take elements of CSI and put them in a hospital setting, and you have House, M.D.  Dr. House is in charge of Diagnostic Medicine at a prestigous New Jersey hospital near Princeton University.  He has a small team of experts in various areas to help him.  His job is to diagnose mysterious conditions/diseases that no one else is able to solve or figure out.One of the biggest reasons why CSI works so well is because people LOVE puzzles!  And House M.D. is just that.  Now, you might find yourself having a hard time trying to figure out what the disease of the week is, since few people have a medical degree, but that doesn't matter.  The joy of the show is in the journey, not the goal.  You're drawn in because you want to see how they will figure out what the problem is.The supporting cast is perfect.  Omar Epps is Dr. Foreman, whose expertise is in the field of neurology.  He's probably the only member of the team who isn't intimidated by House, and he isn't afraid to disagree with him.  I've been a fan of Epps since seeing him in his brief stint on ER, in Love & Basketball, and Higher Learning.  He's a great actor.Then, we have Dr. Chase, played by Jesse Spencer.  Chase is a likeable character, but he mostly looks out for himself, even it means making an end-run around House to make sure his job is secure.Jennifer Morrison is great as Dr. Cameron, the only female member of House's team.  She's a bit of a pleaser, and she seems to be the only person who has an idea of who Gregory House is under his facade.  In this way, House finds himself a bit uncomfortable around her.  Cameron can actually penetrate House's facade.  She's highly intuitive even though she's a bit naive due to her age and lack of experience.Dr. Cuddy, who is in charge of the hospital is wonderfully played by Lisa Edelstein.  The verbal exchanges between House and Cuddy are superb.  House is the defiant doctor who hates doing clinic duty, and Cuddy is the superior who is always pulling teeth to get House to ""do his job.""The last cast member is probably my favorite of the supporting characters.  He is arguably House's only friend, Dr. Wilson who is in charge of the oncology department.  He's played by Robert Sean Leonard, a brilliant actor who is noted mostly for his stage work, but also for playing the tragic character of Neil Perry in Dead Poet's Society.  Wilson seems to the be the only person who can truly put up with House and his antics, although Wilson often wonders why he even bothers.As good as the stories are in this show, I must confess that the biggest reason I love this show is to watch Hugh Laurie work his magic.  We've had Archie Bunker and Thomas Magnum, but we haven't yet had an irascible doctor like Gregory House.  And even though you probably wouldn't like him at all if he were a real person, you can't help but love him in House M.D., for how many likeable characters aren't afraid to speak their minds...about anything!",5,Hugh Laurie Is the Reason For the Success of House M.D.,1182384000,"06 21, 2007",2007,4577,"['once', 'while', 'actor', 'able', 'take', 'character', 'make', 'him/her', 'uniquely', 'own', 'are', 'also', 'able', 'make', 'character', 'so', 'appealing', 'one', 'can', 'soon', 'forget', ""n't"", 'happen', 'as', 'often', 'one', 'might', 'think', 'can', 'think', 'handful', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'Mr.', 'Spock', 'Henry', 'Winkler', 'Fonzy', 'even', 'more', 'recently', 'William', 'Petersen', 'Gil', 'Grissom', 'Hugh', 'Laurie', 'most', 'definitely', 'must', 'be', 'placed', 'community', 'actors', 'performances.Gregory', 'House', 'not', 'typical', 'doctor', 'lovely', 'bedside', 'manner', 'anything', 'opposite', 'almost', 'nose', 'up', 'who', 'make', 'bad', 'decisions', 'people', 'who', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'bright', 'when', 'answer', 'clearly', 'staring', 'face', 'almost', 'vicious', 'contempt', 'people', 'be', 'fellow', 'doctors', 'patients', 'might', 'then', 'ask', 'then', 'why', 'even', 'remotely', 'appealing', 'flip', 'side', 'House', 'care', 'even', 'will', 'never', 'admit', 'much', 'wounded', 'child', 'only', 'pleasure', 'playing', 'video', 'games', 'hand-held', 'Gameboy', 'watching', 'General', 'Hospital', 'favorite', 'TV', 'show', 'funny', 'line', 'be', 'said', 'even', 'mild', 'insult', 'Gregory', 'House', 'will', 'say', 'second', 'thought', 'Anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'Hugh', 'Laurie', 'other', 'roles', 'especially', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'can', 'easily', 'see', 'role', 'Dr.', 'House', 'can', 'not', 'emphasize', 'enough', 'how', 'good', 'As', 'good', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Hugh', 'steal', 'virtually', 'scene', 'in.You', 'might', 'think', 'House', 'M.D', 'just', 'doctor', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'wrong', 'Take', 'elements', 'CSI', 'put', 'hospital', 'setting', 'have', 'House', 'M.D', 'Dr.', 'House', 'charge', 'Diagnostic', 'Medicine', 'prestigous', 'New', 'Jersey', 'hospital', 'Princeton', 'University', 'small', 'team', 'experts', 'various', 'areas', 'help', 'job', 'diagnose', 'mysterious', 'conditions/diseases', 'one', 'else', 'able', 'solve', 'figure', 'out.One', 'biggest', 'reasons', 'why', 'CSI', 'so', 'well', 'people', 'LOVE', 'House', 'M.D', 'just', 'Now', 'might', 'find', 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'disease', 'week', 'few', 'people', 'have', 'medical', 'degree', ""n't"", 'matter', 'joy', 'show', 'journey', 'not', 'goal', ""'re"", 'drawn', 'want', 'see', 'how', 'will', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'problem', 'is.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'perfect', 'Omar', 'Epps', 'Dr.', 'Foreman', 'expertise', 'field', 'neurology', 'probably', 'only', 'member', 'team', 'who', ""n't"", 'intimidated', 'House', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'disagree', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'Epps', 'seeing', 'brief', 'stint', 'ER', 'Love', 'Basketball', 'Higher', 'Learning', 'great', 'actor.Then', 'have', 'Dr.', 'Chase', 'played', 'Jesse', 'Spencer', 'Chase', 'likeable', 'character', 'mostly', 'out', 'even', 'making', 'end-run', 'around', 'House', 'make', 'sure', 'job', 'secure.Jennifer', 'Morrison', 'great', 'Dr.', 'Cameron', 'only', 'female', 'member', 'House', 'team', 'bit', 'pleaser', 'be', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'idea', 'who', 'Gregory', 'House', 'facade', 'way', 'House', 'bit', 'uncomfortable', 'Cameron', 'can', 'actually', 'penetrate', 'House', 'facade', 'highly', 'intuitive', 'even', 'bit', 'naive', 'due', 'age', 'lack', 'experience.Dr', 'Cuddy', 'who', 'charge', 'hospital', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'Lisa', 'Edelstein', 'verbal', 'exchanges', 'House', 'Cuddy', 'are', 'superb', 'House', 'defiant', 'doctor', 'who', 'doing', 'clinic', 'duty', 'Cuddy', 'superior', 'who', 'always', 'pulling', 'teeth', 'get', 'House', 'do', 'job', 'last', 'cast', 'member', 'probably', 'favorite', 'supporting', 'characters', 'arguably', 'House', 'only', 'friend', 'Dr.', 'Wilson', 'who', 'charge', 'oncology', 'department', 'played', 'Robert', 'Sean', 'Leonard', 'brilliant', 'actor', 'who', 'noted', 'mostly', 'stage', 'work', 'also', 'playing', 'tragic', 'character', 'Neil', 'Perry', 'Dead', 'Poet', 'Society', 'Wilson', 'be', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'can', 'truly', 'put', 'up', 'House', 'antics', 'Wilson', 'often', 'why', 'even', 'bothers.As', 'good', 'stories', 'are', 'show', 'must', 'confess', 'biggest', 'reason', 'love', 'show', 'watch', 'Hugh', 'Laurie', 'work', 'magic', ""'ve"", 'had', 'Archie', 'Bunker', 'Thomas', 'Magnum', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'had', 'irascible', 'doctor', 'Gregory', 'House', 'even', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'like', 'were', 'real', 'person', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'love', 'House', 'M.D.', 'how', 'many', 'likeable', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'speak', 'minds', 'anything']",N/A

It's a bit like The Practice, only from the medical world. A diagnostic thriller of sorts. It is only ever so often that a show comes along with such dazzling wit, riveting themes, fascinating characters, even a superlative soundtrack.There is ""detective"" work involved here for sure. Patients in throes of some unusual disease. Lying out of embarrassment. Unfamiliar with what they did wrong. Indisposed. Or exhibiting conflicting symptoms. Somehow, episode after episode, you can't tear your eyes away from the screen. It's a mystery. What did he do wrong? What really happened? How will our eccentric Dr. House and his band of whitecoats figure this one out? It's real-time sleuthing work as we frantically explore the options along with them to beat the clock. Glued to the end.Naturally, you'd suspect that a formula of diagnosing a key patient would wear off after a bit. But from prudish nuns, to seance-cursed kids, to 80 year olds with raging libido, the patients are delectably left of center. The production quality is top gun. The team behind this seems to have had its squirrels so well-herded that the byproduct is a taut, addictive show, one of the best to hit television in a long time. If anything, at least in Season 1, it only seems to have gotten sharper as we begin to relate to the interplay between characters, feel their own private tensions and idiosyncrasies.While it is wittier than Scrubs (which shot off the gates with gusto but soon got jaded) and more thrilling than your ER or Green Hill or Chicago Hope, the best part is that the treatment is made accessible with a marvel of writing. All the medical jazz is propped with stunningly choreographed 3D imagery that shows what might have been going on with the patient, a visual vocabulary that is redolent of the top Discovery or Nat Geo programs.And if all of that has not convinced you yet, it's a funny, funny script. ""Ah, the Socratic Method. The best way we have of teaching everything-apart from juggling chainsaws."" There is a sardonic look at the pill-toting, allopathy-reliant society of our times where people show up at their doctor's fearing ""chronic fatigue syndrome"" because they have been ""tired all the time"" or because their feet are aching after running six miles. Dr. House's treatment of these fillers is a blast. But his passion for curiosity and diagnosis makes you wish your own doctors were like him.One of the few shows that will hold up to repeat viewings.

In Detox episode, he fights his demon and loses.  another example, how one of his team members sold him out when one of them was about to be fired.  it's truly humane.fourth, daring and realistic.  e.g., some of you might've thought that house might-ve been in a relationship with Cuddy as implied in several dialogues.  but the series just concluded the ""issue"" with the appearance of Stacy (sela ward) not draging it into the next season (s) trying to make it a ""mystery"" so fans would continue watching it.  another, before the stacy conclusion, was the Edward volger stories. a significant part of season 1, but smartly concluded.  what about House and Cameron relationship ? also concluded well.  in short, it takes one big story, tell it well over 2-3 episodes, conclude it (not always happy ending but that's reality), and jump to another big story without making it up.all this is consistent thruout all episodes, you'll be entertained, amazed, laugh, sad, etc etc. GO SEE IT...the best in years...this is what you have been waiting for a while since the X-Files.

He is naturally a lead who can make a character become more then type on a page.The show itself elevates well over other prime time TV.  I stopped watching prime time except in random samplings due to the bombardment of inane stories, less then dimensional characters, regurgitated situations, over emphatic lighting choices, unrealistic settings, fashion drama, pretty boys, bland dialogue, preachy morals or lack of morals, etc.  House thankfully overcame the bad, overly colored lighting, sharp stinging music and sfx drowning out the audio, and gave us witty dialogue, unique situations, and thoughtful interpretation along with excellent acting.  On a sombre note, the producers didn't have enough faith in strength of story and character to drop the plethora of sex appeal and aim a bit more realistic, or even gritty in casting choices outside of Laurie.The great failing of this series, which no one seems to mind, is that the spine of the stories is dictated by obscenely specific medical knowledge that comes in one ear and goes out the other.  Most people are not general practitioners of medicine.  I doubt most viewers know or care what these cases are about, but it sounds darn good and convincing when said with such moral certainty projected through Laurie.I would say this is the best TV has to offer at this time.  Surrounded by immature humor cartoons, fatuous crime dramas, and sad sitcoms with over emphatic laugh tracks, House M.D. looks like a fresh daisy in a garbage dump.",4,"Reviewing the show, not the slack DVD package...",1134172800,"12 10, 2005",2005,1910,"['Hugh', 'Laurie', 'drove', 'House', 'following', 'career', 'very', 'beginning', 'quick', 'side', 'character', 'Young', 'Ones', 'never', 'bad', 'performance', 'was', 'worried', 'would', 'have', 'bland', 'performance', 'American', 'prime', 'time', 'TV', 'Faking', 'American', 'accent', 'strange', 'twang', 'otherworldly', 'same', 'time', 'character', 'Laurie', 'strikes', 'again', 'naturally', 'lead', 'who', 'can', 'make', 'character', 'become', 'more', 'then', 'type', 'page.The', 'show', 'well', 'other', 'prime', 'time', 'TV', 'stopped', 'watching', 'prime', 'time', 'random', 'samplings', 'due', 'bombardment', 'inane', 'stories', 'less', 'then', 'dimensional', 'characters', 'regurgitated', 'situations', 'emphatic', 'lighting', 'choices', 'unrealistic', 'settings', 'fashion', 'drama', 'pretty', 'bland', 'dialogue', 'preachy', 'morals', 'lack', 'morals', 'etc', 'House', 'thankfully', 'bad', 'overly', 'colored', 'lighting', 'sharp', 'stinging', 'music', 'sfx', 'drowning', 'audio', 'gave', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'unique', 'situations', 'thoughtful', 'interpretation', 'excellent', 'acting', 'sombre', 'note', 'producers', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'faith', 'strength', 'story', 'character', 'drop', 'plethora', 'sex', 'appeal', 'aim', 'bit', 'more', 'realistic', 'even', 'gritty', 'casting', 'choices', 'Laurie.The', 'great', 'failing', 'series', 'one', 'mind', 'spine', 'stories', 'dictated', 'obscenely', 'specific', 'medical', 'knowledge', 'one', 'ear', 'out', 'other', 'Most', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'general', 'practitioners', 'medicine', 'doubt', 'most', 'viewers', 'know', 'care', 'what', 'cases', 'are', 'darn', 'good', 'convincing', 'when', 'said', 'such', 'moral', 'certainty', 'projected', 'Laurie.I', 'would', 'say', 'best', 'TV', 'offer', 'time', 'Surrounded', 'immature', 'humor', 'cartoons', 'fatuous', 'crime', 'dramas', 'sad', 'sitcoms', 'emphatic', 'laugh', 'tracks', 'House', 'M.D', 'fresh', 'daisy', 'garbage', 'dump']",N/A

915125,AEZDGIIKFNS8,B0009WPM1Q,"T. Gabriel ""tegabriel""","[2, 2]","This is a more a review of the series, than of season 1. I have watched 5 seasons and I think you should know what you are getting into.Gregory House is to Vicodin as you, the viewer, are to House M.D., the tv program. The show is a drug and you need your weekly fix. The Show, like the drug, is manufactured to a consistent standard, providing essentially the same benefit with every viewing. But, as with the consumption of any drug, you become tolerant, and need larger doses; the show periodically responds with bursts of drama or more persuasive melodrama.You come for the medical drama, but stay for the melodrama, which is distributed with the finest granules possible. There is no chance of overdosing on the melodrama. Most of the addictive quality of the show is the result of you waiting for something to happen in the melodrama. Relatively speaking, ordinary soap operas move at a break neck pace.If you are a doctor, med student, or hypochondriac, then you may find the medical mysteries fascinating, but as an episode finishes and I am frequently at a loss to remember either the disease or the cure, as each is expressed in lightning bolts of medical lingo.You won't really care for the disease-infested characters, maybe not even for the other characters except, of course, for House, the most active ingredient in this show/drug. You wonder how badly things will end for this character, much like you wondered how badly Sopranos would end (even if it didn't end at all.) Dr. James Wilson doesn't seem like someone prone to divorce- none of his ex-wives has made an appearance - and he is an underdeveloped character but his relationship with House is the most likable part of the series. The Dr. Lisa Cuddy character almost provides a love interest and you might almost care about her. The 'fellows', House's assistants, provide small amounts of flavoring to the mix. These assistants change over time, but if they changed with every episode, you might not care, or perhaps be glad they did.This sounds like a downer of a review, but I have watched 5 seasons on DVD with my wife and child, and I've ordered season 6. What I must conclude is that we are junkies.One last thing, the season 1 discs I purchased were 1-sided, but I see that there is also a 2-sided version. Pay attention to that detail when you buy.

915129,AV5G37VFE5NVD,B0009WPM1Q,Tom Benton,"[3, 4]","With the amount of medical shows that have popped up over the years, one would think that they've run out of ideas already.  HOUSE, M.D. is proof that that's not so.  It's an addictive, intriguing, and well-made, albeit formulaic series about a rude, sarcastic man who happens to be the greatest doctor alive.  His name is Gregory House, and thanks to Hugh Laurie's performance, he is one of the most fun and interesting characters in TV history.The problem with the show is that each episode follows the same formula.  Random person becomes sick and is taken to the hospital.  House and his team struggle to find out what's wrong with the person.  The team comes up with an answer and gives the person what they believe is the cure.  But the cure's not the cure - the person gets worse.  Running out of time, House must find the answer - and quick.  This formula makes the episodes somewhat predictable, but the oddity of the uncommon diseases will keep the viewer coming back for more.Of course, everyone knows the real reason that people watch this show: Hugh Laurie.  The fact that Laurie has yet to win an Emmy is undeniable proof that the Emmy Awards are as ridiculous as the Academy Awards.  Laurie is utterly fantastic as House.  His rudeness is actually quite amusing, and his sarcastic remarks are often hilarious, while his direct approach to things and apparent lack of humanity is frequently appalling.  What makes House such a great character is that beneath his foul manners and cruelty, there's a lot of humanity; some of the show's finest moments are when this humanity emerges.  I would say that Hugh Laurie's performance as House is undoubtedly the greatest performance on television today.  The supporting cast is great as well, particularly Lisa Edelstein as Dr. Lisa Cuddy, the head of Princeton-Plainsborough Teaching Hospital who is forced to put up with House's antisocial antics but who secretly has a lot of respect and support for him.  Robert Sean Leonard plays Dr. James Wilson, House's one true friend, a real nice guy who has some wonderful interactions with House.  House's team of interns, including Omar Epps, Jesse Spencer, and Jennifer Morrison, are also great, especially Morrison as a rather naiive young woman with a kind heart.The writing is excellent.  The characters seem like real people; this works especially well in making us care for the patients.  House's witticisms are delightful.  The best writing comes from series creator David Shore.  The season's penultimate episode, ""Three Stories"", is brilliant.  In the episode - written by Shore - House is forced to give a lecture to a group of young medical students; the result is an episode that is at times very funny and, towards the end, extremely moving.  It is one of the best things I've ever seen on TV.  Shore deservedly won an Emmy for his work on that episode.There are currently two major medical shows that are relatively new: GREY'S ANATOMY and HOUSE, M.D.  At the light end of the medical show spectrum we have GREY'S ANATOMY, while HOUSE is at the dark end.  Though the show is far darker than GREY'S ANATOMY - which is also an excellent show, by the way - HOUSE is very fun and frequently very funny.  It is certainly one of the best shows on television.  The first season of HOUSE, M.D. is outstanding, and you know what?  Season two is even better.  Don't hesitate to give this show a shot.",5,"""Hello, sick people and their loved ones!""",1153785600,"07 25, 2006",2006,3406,"['amount', 'medical', 'shows', 'have', 'popped', 'up', 'years', 'one', 'would', 'think', ""'ve"", 'run', 'ideas', 'already', 'HOUSE', 'M.D', 'proof', 'not', 'so', 'addictive', 'intriguing', 'well-made', 'formulaic', 'series', 'rude', 'sarcastic', 'man', 'who', 'be', 'greatest', 'doctor', 'alive', 'name', 'Gregory', 'House', 'thanks', 'Hugh', 'Laurie', 'performance', 'one', 'most', 'fun', 'interesting', 'characters', 'TV', 'history.The', 'problem', 'show', 'episode', 'same', 'formula', 'Random', 'person', 'sick', 'taken', 'hospital', 'House', 'team', 'struggle', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'wrong', 'person', 'team', 'up', 'answer', 'person', 'what', 'believe', 'cure', 'cure', 'not', 'cure', 'person', 'worse', 'Running', 'time', 'House', 'must', 'find', 'answer', 'quick', 'formula', 'episodes', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'oddity', 'uncommon', 'diseases', 'will', 'keep', 'viewer', 'coming', 'back', 'more.Of', 'course', 'everyone', 'real', 'reason', 'people', 'watch', 'show', 'Hugh', 'Laurie', 'fact', 'Laurie', 'yet', 'win', 'Emmy', 'undeniable', 'proof', 'Emmy', 'Awards', 'are', 'as', 'ridiculous', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'Laurie', 'utterly', 'fantastic', 'House', 'rudeness', 'actually', 'quite', 'amusing', 'sarcastic', 'remarks', 'are', 'often', 'hilarious', 'direct', 'approach', 'things', 'apparent', 'lack', 'humanity', 'frequently', 'appalling', 'What', 'House', 'such', 'great', 'character', 'foul', 'manners', 'cruelty', 'lot', 'humanity', 'show', 'finest', 'moments', 'are', 'when', 'humanity', 'would', 'say', 'Hugh', 'Laurie', 'performance', 'House', 'undoubtedly', 'greatest', 'performance', 'television', 'today', 'supporting', 'cast', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'particularly', 'Lisa', 'Edelstein', 'Dr.', 'Lisa', 'Cuddy', 'head', 'Princeton-Plainsborough', 'Teaching', 'Hospital', 'who', 'forced', 'put', 'up', 'House', 'antisocial', 'antics', 'who', 'secretly', 'lot', 'respect', 'support', 'Robert', 'Sean', 'Leonard', 'Dr.', 'James', 'Wilson', 'House', 'one', 'true', 'friend', 'real', 'nice', 'guy', 'who', 'wonderful', 'interactions', 'House', 'House', 'team', 'interns', 'including', 'Omar', 'Epps', 'Jesse', 'Spencer', 'Jennifer', 'Morrison', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'especially', 'Morrison', 'rather', 'naiive', 'young', 'woman', 'kind', 'heart.The', 'writing', 'excellent', 'characters', 'seem', 'real', 'people', 'especially', 'well', 'making', 'care', 'patients', 'House', 'witticisms', 'are', 'delightful', 'best', 'writing', 'series', 'creator', 'David', 'Shore', 'season', 'penultimate', 'episode', 'Three', 'Stories', 'brilliant', 'episode', 'written', 'Shore', 'House', 'forced', 'give', 'lecture', 'group', 'young', 'medical', 'students', 'result', 'episode', 'times', 'very', 'funny', 'end', 'extremely', 'moving', 'one', 'best', 'things', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'TV', 'Shore', 'deservedly', 'won', 'Emmy', 'work', 'are', 'currently', 'two', 'major', 'medical', 'shows', 'are', 'relatively', 'new', 'GREY', 'ANATOMY', 'HOUSE', 'M.D', 'light', 'end', 'medical', 'show', 'spectrum', 'have', 'GREY', 'ANATOMY', 'HOUSE', 'dark', 'end', 'show', 'far', 'darker', 'GREY', 'ANATOMY', 'also', 'excellent', 'show', 'way', 'HOUSE', 'very', 'fun', 'frequently', 'very', 'funny', 'certainly', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'television', 'first', 'season', 'HOUSE', 'M.D', 'outstanding', 'know', 'what', 'Season', 'two', 'even', 'better', 'Do', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'give', 'show', 'shot']",N/A

915135,A2BF3Z1UOWFBY,B0009WPM1Q,Upright Ape,"[2, 2]","I like House M. D. very much overall, enough to start collecting the entire series on DVD; but Season One was actually the low point for me, largely because of the resolution of the plot-line involving CEO Edward Vogler.  I gave the season a 3-star rating because even with that significant disappointment, I thought House M. D. was better than average as a medical drama. Two stars would have been too harsh.By comparison, all of the other seasons but seven (which hasn't aired yet as of the date of this review) have been outstanding.As with any series, season one's writing, context, themes, characterizations, production, et al, experienced some initial unevenness as cast and crew worked through their adjustments to each other and the series.  For example, there was the almost unbelievable degree to which the characters interfered in each others' personal lives.  Yes, there are busybodies everywhere, especially in such interactive workplace settings as hospitals.  However there were times when the Princeton Plainsboro Teaching Hospital seemed more like the Princeton Plainsboro Junior High School - a building populated by self-appointed experts in everything, especially the one thing they all seemed to do worst: handle their own interpersonal relationships.In one sequence two of the characters seem ready to begin tentative dating.  One of them asks the other not to tell their coworkers anything about it.  Now, what would a junior high school student do?  You guessed it.  The ""personal"" secret is divulged within seconds of the promise not to do so.  Immediately thereafter, the other members of the clique weigh in with their expert advice.Events like these tended to moderate somewhat towards the end of the season.  Unfortunately, no one ever said anything realistic like ""shut up and mind your own business"", as if any of these characters would have complied.  On the other hand, the close personal friendships that might include such interventions did become more easily identified as the series progressed, as did the usual shallow manipulators found everywhere, here elevated to the level of caricature.All of the foregoing is to be expected in a new series.  That House M. D. survives this adjustment in style is a testament to what is positive about the series.With the entry of the new CEO Edward Vogler, things got really interesting.  The show's producers and writers were faced with the challenge of creating an antithesis for Dr. House.  This could not have been easy given the already established complexities of the character, as well as House's ability to serve as his own antithesis.  They came up with a brilliant idea.  They combined the characters of Drs. House, Cutty, and Wilson, and created Vogler as the antithesis to the combination.Before I go into the major spoilers, I'll describe part of the scenario without giving away any critical details - I hope.  I've re-read the following paragraphs a few times and I don't believe I've said anything that would ruin the watching of this particular plot-line for a new viewer.  If you're worried about that, you might want to skip the rest of this review.  If you're not, keep reading until you get to the in-your-face spoiler warning.Now then - in one corner was Edward Vogler, the hospital's worst nightmare: a new self-appointed CEO with a lot of money the hospital needed and an agenda that had nothing to do with healthcare.  He ruled a pharmaceutical empire and was out to bring in big business for himself and his corporation. He was played in fantastic form by Chi McBride and was a delight to watch as he played the villainous genius.In the other corner was the good-guy genius, the gestalt House/Cutty/Wilson.  House was the irascible rebel aspect, all medical talent and drive for that talent, unwilling to let anything get in between him and his advocacy for his patients.  In fact he used the word often whenever asked to explain why he persevered with a patient against seemingly impossible medical and bureaucratic odds: ""I advocated for my patient.""  Like Vogler, he would not compromise.Cutty was the mediating aspect, trying desperately to come up with a way out of the mess that would salvage something positive.  She was uncertain at first.  She made mistakes.  But she figured it out and opted for the only sane solution, as painful as the necessary sacrifices were to make that happen.Wilson was pure loyalty, House's closest friend for reasons they themselves didn't completely understand, but never in question when it came to knowing what should be done.  He picked up the slack in Cutty's uncertainty.With players like Hugh Laurie as Dr. House, Lisa Edelstein as Dr. Cutty, and Robert Sean Leonard as Dr. Wilson arrayed against Chi McBride's Vogler character, a virtual nuclear war for control of the hospital ensued.  For his part, Vogler was honest about what he wanted.  It wasn't about the money.  He wanted House's obedience.While the war was great fun to watch, the outcome contained two elements I did not like.  That's where the major spoilers come in.  So,*** WARNING WARNING WARNING ****** MAJOR SPOILERS FOLLOW ****** DON'T READ ON UNLESS YOU'VE ALREADY SEEN THE OUTCOME, OR YOU DON'T MIND KNOWING SOMETHING ABOUT IT ***Two medical emergencies, one proving to be fatal for one patient, occurred just prior to the end of the conflict.  Meanwhile, Vogler was in the process of trying to eliminate his competition on the Board of Directors - by then both Cutty and Wilson had voted against him - so that he could get a unanimous vote to fire House.In one of the emergencies, House and his team were trying to treat a pregnant woman who was undergoing a number of grave physical and psychological crises.  Treatment of the mother's illness could kill the baby.  A C-Section at that time carried a 20% mortality risk for the baby.After some give and take with his staff and the parents, House decides that the optimum solution for mother, child, and father, is to deliver the baby by C-Section as soon as possible.  Treatment for the mother's serious illness would follow immediately after delivery.Just as the C-Section surgery was about to begin, Vogler called directly into the operating room and canceled the surgery. I wasn't clear on his exact justification for doing that, but it was obvious that he was making his final moves to get House out of the picture.The mother then developed another serious complication that ultimately will kill her.  House informs the father that the only option at that point was to save the child.  The C-Section was then performed successfully but the mother died as expected.It seemed clear to me that had the original C-Section surgery not been canceled by Vogler, there was a chance that both mother and child would both have survived.  The baby would have been delivered.  At that time if the mother still experienced the complication, she could have been treated more aggresively because the baby would be in no danger from her emergency treatment.Vogler ultimately lost his battle against the board by way of Cutty's final defiance and impassioned speech.  What did not happen was any charge of culpability in the mother's death against Vogler.  By interfering with that C-Section when he did, he prevented the doctors from being able to treat the mother aggressively when the additional complication occurred.  Essentially, Vogler practiced medicine without a license.  And as a demonstrable result, a patient died.That was my major disappointment with the resolution of the Vogler plotline.  Vogler's meddling killed a patient.  Vogler did not pay for this crime.My other disappointment concerned a somewhat less serious case.  Am infant with low weight and seemingly poor nutrition problems was treated by House.  He concluded that the Vegan diet given to the infant by her parents had compromised the nutrition of the child enough to palce the child in danger.  However he did not personally consider their actions to be unlawful negligence.  He made the judgment call that they had just been stupid and recommended a course of treatment including a healthy diet.  He was confident that they would follow his instructions.Vogler interfered with this treatment as well.  He got wind of what House was doing and forced Cutty to call a state child support agents to have the parents arrested just as House was about to send the child home with them.The parents made bail and immediately returned to the hospital to petition Dr. House to let them see the child.  In the course of telling them that it was out of his hands legally, they told him that the child's Vegan diet and been supervised by a licensed nutritionist.  He had not known this when he made the first diagnosis.  He re-examined the child, found a medical condition unrelated to parental negligence, treated the child successfully, and got Cutty to reverse the charges against the couple.I'm on shaky ground with this one because Vogler's culpability involves a little second-guessing.  Technically, Vogler took advantage of a valid legal situation and an initial mistake by House to countermand what the doctor was doing.  However, given the way House worked and how the series and progressed thus far, I realized the House would have eventually realized his mistake and treated the child successfully.  Not only is this consistent with how he always works - but in this particular case, the child's non-response to the initial dietary treatment would have made him suspicious of another cause.  He would have determined the real cause anyway, with no one being arrested in the interim.Thus while what Vogel did was legalistically valid, the ultimate result was the arrest of the parents on false charges.  This is where the word ""unethical"" comes into play.  Once again, Vogler was practicing medicine without a license.  And once again, a mistake at the expense of a patient and family was made.  As before, Vogel did not suffer any liability for this mistake.Vogel was of course tossed by the Hospital board by votes in favor of House, Wilson, and Cutty.  But he also took his $100 million investment with him, and went back to being a plain old CEO of a pharmaceutical empire.  His own board and stockholders may have taken offense against him at things House said during a speech on one of the company's new products.  This was never mentioned in the series.Vogel made costly mistakes in patient health and lives.  His new drug was exposed as a sham by House at a press release.  He got away with too much.All of that was why the resolution of the Vogler plot-line in season one disappointed me.  In was a huge anti-climax after the brilliantly played sparring between the major players.Aside from those minor points, everything was fine.  The series has been great otherwise.UpRight Ape",3,"Season One, CEO Vogler, Babies, and Bathwater",1284163200,"09 11, 2010",2010,10825,"['like', 'House', 'M.', 'D.', 'very', 'much', 'overall',

915139,A3N5XIM9R2OQH0,B0009WPM1Q,Wheelchair Assassin,"[20, 21]","Much as The Shield did for cop shows a few years ago, House has managed to breathe some new life into a tried-and-true TV format, in this case the medical drama.  Granted, it's not even entirely accurate to call House a medical drama, as it largely subverts the form's conventions by mixing them with ample doses of mystery and comedy, not to mention a sardonic, pill-popping doctor who rarely sees his patients and doesn't even seem to care about them much of the time.  Whatever the case, though, House is easily one of the best shows to hit TV in the past five years, and a reason to keep watching in spite of the reality glut.  Sure, it doesn't boast the peity or ER or the sensationalism of Nip/Tuck, but in their place is reams of wit, insight, and plaintive musings on life and death.Dr. House is obviously in the lead (hence the title, duh), and Hugh Laurie's performance easily puts House right up there with Vic Mackey, Jack Bauer, and Eric Cartman in my personal pantheon of most memorable TV characters.  House mostly works as a character because you can't really put a label on him--he's not quite a hero, but he's not quite an anti-hero either, and he's never just a stick figure.  He's actually my favorite type of character--complex, deeply flawed, and undeniably human.  Beneath all his sarcasm, skepticism, and cynicism is a genuine understanding of human nature and a commitment to doing the right thing even if it takes lying, deceit, and bullying to do it.  Yes, he's a little over the top, but it wouldn't be much of a show if he weren't, now would it?Of course, it also greatly helps its cause that this show is frequently and hysterically funny.  It's a sort of humor you don't see all that often on TV, too, except in shows created by Joss Whedon.  There's no slapstick, surrealism, or Arrested Development-style goofiness, just a steady stream of snappy one-liners from House mocking the pretense and shallow thinking that he so clearly hates.  Admittedly, House gets pretty much all of the best lines, with the rest mostly divided between his friend Dr. Wilson and his boss Dr. Cuddy, but it hardly matters when there are at least five laugh-out loud moments per episode.  It's sort of sad that a so-called drama is easily one of the funniest shows on TV right now, but that's just a sign of how well House manages to cross genre boundaries.As some have pointed out, most of the episodes are pretty much the same--patient comes in with an unidentified ailment, House and his team go through several alternative diagnoses, patient takes several turns for the worse, House comes up with a brilliantly offbeat, MacGyver-esque solution--but that's not really the point.  It's really the ongoing threads that elevate House from merely interesting to consistently compelling--House's complicated professional relationship with his underlings, whom he alternately pushes, browbeats, disparages, and very occasionally praises; the ambiguous feelings between House and the smoking-hot Dr. Cameron; his head-butting confrontations with Dr. Cuddy; and the comic relief of House's constant efforts to get out of free-clinic duty.  This season also gets noticably better when the show brings in the gargantuan Chi McBride for a five episode arc as billionaire venture capitalist Edward Vogler, who buys his way onto the board of directors and becomes the perfect foil for House: ruthlessly imperious, bottom line-obsessed, and utterly Machiavellian.If there's one problem with this season, it comes at the end, when the show introduces House's ex-girlfriend Stacy into the plot, leading to their seemingly (though thankfully not actually)interminable, tacked-on affair in the current second season.  Other than that, though, it's one memorable episode after another.  And with the exception of the aforementioned tacked-on affair, season two has managed to be just as good (if a bit more sensationalistic).  And unlike with Firefly, Arrested Development, Undeclared, and Andy Richter Controls the Universe, the ratings are good enough that Fox pretty much has to stick with it.",4,The anti-ER,1144972800,"04 14, 2006",2006,4091,"['Much', 'Shield', 'did', 'cop', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'House', 'managed', 'breathe', 'new', 'life', 'tried-and-true', 'TV', 'format', 'case', 'medical', 'drama', 'Granted', 'not', 'even', 'entirely', 'accurate', 'call', 'House', 'medical', 'drama', 'largely', 'form', 'conventions', 'mixing', 'ample', 'doses', 'mystery', 'comedy', 'not', 'mention', 'sardonic', 'pill-popping', 'doctor', 'who', 'rarely', 'patients', ""n't"", 'even', 'seem', 'care', 'much', 'time', 'case', 'though', 'House', 'easily', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'hit', 'TV', 'past', 'five', 'years', 'reason', 'keep', 'watching', 'spite', 'reality', 'glut', 'Sure', ""n't"", 'boast', 'peity', 'ER', 'sensationalism', 'Nip/Tuck', 'place', 'reams', 'wit', 'insight', 'plaintive', 'musings', 'life', 'death.Dr', 'House', 'obviously', 'lead', 'title', 'duh', 'Hugh', 'Laurie', 'performance', 'easily', 'House', 'right', 'up', 'there', 'Vic', 'Mackey', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'Eric', 'Cartman', 'personal', 'pantheon', 'most', 'memorable', 'TV', 'characters', 'House', 'mostly', 'character', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'put', 'label', 'not', 'quite', 'hero', 'not', 'quite', 'anti-hero', 'either', 'never', 'just', 'stick', 'figure', 'actually', 'favorite', 'type', 'character', 'complex', 'deeply', 'flawed', 'undeniably', 'human', 'sarcasm', 'skepticism', 'cynicism', 'genuine', 'understanding', 'human', 'nature', 'commitment', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'even', 'lying', 'deceit', 'bullying', 'do', 'Yes', 'little', 'top', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'much', 'show', 'were', ""n't"", 'now', 'would', 'course', 'also', 'greatly', 'cause', 'show', 'frequently', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'sort', 'humor', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'often', 'TV', 'too', 'shows', 'created', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'slapstick', 'surrealism', 'Arrested', 'Development-style', 'goofiness', 'just', 'steady', 'stream', 'snappy', 'one-liners', 'House', 'mocking', 'pretense', 'shallow', 'thinking', 'so', 'clearly', 'hates', 'Admittedly', 'House', 'pretty', 'much', 'best', 'lines', 'rest', 'mostly', 'divided', 'friend', 'Dr.', 'Wilson', 'boss', 'Dr.', 'Cuddy', 'hardly', 'matters', 'when', 'are', 'least', 'five', 'laugh-out', 'loud', 'moments', 'episode', 'sort', 'sad', 'so-called', 'drama', 'easily', 'one', 'funniest', 'shows', 'TV', 'right', 'now', 'just', 'sign', 'how', 'well', 'House', 'cross', 'genre', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'most', 'episodes', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'patient', 'unidentified', 'ailment', 'House', 'team', 'go', 'several', 'alternative', 'diagnoses', 'patient', 'several', 'turns', 'worse', 'House', 'up', 'brilliantly', 'offbeat', 'MacGyver-esque', 'solution', 'not', 'really', 'point', 'really', 'ongoing', 'threads', 'elevate', 'House', 'merely', 'interesting', 'consistently', 'compelling', 'House', 'complicated', 'professional', 'relationship', 'underlings', 'whom', 'alternately', 'browbeats', 'disparages', 'very', 'occasionally', 'ambiguous', 'feelings', 'House', 'smoking-hot', 'Dr.', 'Cameron', 'head-butting', 'confrontations', 'Dr.', 'Cuddy', 'comic', 'relief', 'House', 'constant', 'efforts', 'get', 'free-clinic', 'duty', 'season', 'also', 'noticably', 'better', 'when', 'show', 'gargantuan', 'Chi', 'McBride', 'five', 'episode', 'arc', 'billionaire', 'venture', 'capitalist', 'Edward', 'Vogler', 'who', 'buys', 'way', 'board', 'directors', 'perfect', 'foil', 'House', 'ruthlessly', 'imperious', 'bottom', 'line-obsessed', 'utterly', 'Machiavellian.If', 'one', 'problem', 'season', 'end', 'when', 'show', 'House', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Stacy', 'plot', 'leading', 'seemingly', 'thankfully', 'not', 'actually', 'interminable', 'tacked-on', 'affair', 'current', 'second', 'season', 'Other', 'though', 'one', 'memorable', 'episode', 'exception', 'aforementioned', 'tacked-on', 'affair', 'season', 'two', 'managed', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'bit', 'more', 'sensationalistic', 'Firefly', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'Undeclared', 'Andy', 'Richter', 'Controls', 'Universe', 'ratings', 'are', 'good', 'enough', 'Fox', 'pretty', 'much', 'stick']",N/A
