It is also one of my favorite genres for movies, but the plot lacked something.  It is a good movie, not great, but great service from Amazon.",4,review,1370044800,"06 1, 2013",2013,293,"['Even', 'Rock', 'Hudson', 'Yvonne', 'De', 'Carlos', 'are', 'couple', 'favorite', 'actor/actresses', 'was', 'not', 'excited', 'movie', 'had', 'hoped', 'be', 'also', 'one', 'favorite', 'genres', 'movies', 'plot', 'lacked', 'something', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'great', 'great', 'service', 'Amazon']",N/A

Actually, he was capable of Errol-Flynn-type swashbuckling (he did very well in The Golden Blade, made the same year -- 1953), but ""Sea Devils"" was almost plotless, plus one couldn't quite believe that hunky Hudson would fall for Yvonne DeCarlo, who, though voluptuous, seems a bit long in the tooth to be a love interest for him.Hudson plays a Lil Abner-type sailing smuggler in and about the English channel; he's barefoot a good part of the time, and eats with his hands; DeCarlo is a refined spy of some sort during the Napoleonic era.  He saves her, she saves him, they save each other and end up sailing into the sunset, arms entwined.  If you're looking for love scenes, forget it.  I can't even begin to imagine why studio executives bothered making this, except that they probably figured that females would pay to see Rock Hudson shirtless and bound in the hold of a sailing ship.Whatever.",3,Early Rock Hudson,1291507200,"12 5, 2010",2010,1184,"['Ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'recommend', 'one', ""'re"", 'dyed-in-the-wool', 'Hudson', 'fan', 'even', 'then', 'nothing', 'write', 'home', 'about.It', 'early', 'Rock', 'Hollywood', 'quite', 'knew', 'what', 'do', 'still', 'got', 'a-bit-beefy', 'baby-fat', 'role', 'plot', 'are', 'inspiring', 'Actually', 'was', 'capable', 'Errol-Flynn-type', 'swashbuckling', 'did', 'very', 'well', 'Golden', 'Blade', 'made', 'same', 'year', '1953', 'Sea', 'Devils', 'was', 'almost', 'plotless', 'one', 'could', ""n't"", 'quite', 'believe', 'hunky', 'Hudson', 'would', 'fall', 'Yvonne', 'DeCarlo', 'who', 'though', 'voluptuous', 'bit', 'long', 'tooth', 'be', 'love', 'interest', 'him.Hudson', 'Lil', 'Abner-type', 'sailing', 'smuggler', 'English', 'channel', 'barefoot', 'good', 'part', 'time', 'eats', 'hands', 'DeCarlo', 'refined', 'spy', 'sort', 'Napoleonic', 'era', 'save', 'other', 'end', 'up', 'sailing', 'sunset', 'arms', 'entwined', ""'re"", 'looking', 'love', 'scenes', 'forget', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'imagine', 'why', 'studio', 'executives', 'bothered', 'making', 'probably', 'figured', 'females', 'would', 'pay', 'see', 'Rock', 'Hudson', 'shirtless', 'bound', 'hold', 'sailing', 'ship.Whatever']",N/A

And now that I've finished reading Rock Hudson's biography, it goes to show you just how brilliant & gifted of an actor he was! He has amazing screen presence in each of his films!  I highly recommend this one!Yvonne DeCarlo is so intoxicatingly beautiful in this movie! Such smoldering eyes! Absolutely loved her in this! She and Rock Hudson have such great on screen chemistry! I can't wait to see to rest the films they've done together!!I'm really glad to have gotten this from Amazon! From growing up in the `80's, I've never seen these movies before or even gotten into watching movies from this era but wow, they just don't make them like this anymore. And by that I mean movies and their stars.  I hope Hollywood can somehow bring back the glamor, elegance, sophistication, style & grace that the stars of the `50's had.

1319135,AXHCIHVT92GYF,B0032M1908,The CinemaScope Cat,"[2, 3]","Veteran director Raoul Walsh was behind the camera of this average but nonetheless enjoyable swashbuckler cocktail. Yvonne De Carlo (looking quite fetching) is an English spy in Napoleonic France attempting to ferret out invasion plans and Rock Hudson is the smuggler who falls for her and unintentionally botches her both her plans and her cover. Shot in bright Technicolor, it's fun if you're not too demanding. Hudson was on the rise here at the beginning of his stardom but it's really the top billed De Carlo's picture here. Maxwell Reed as a traitorous smuggler and Bryan Forbes (before he became a director of such films as THE WHISPERERS) is Hudson's pal co-star.The VCI transfer is adequate, nothing more.",3,High adventure with De Carlo and Hudson,1316390400,"09 19, 2011",2011,714,"['Veteran', 'director', 'Raoul', 'Walsh', 'was', 'camera', 'average', 'nonetheless', 'enjoyable', 'swashbuckler', 'cocktail', 'Yvonne', 'De', 'Carlo', 'looking', 'quite', 'fetching', 'English', 'spy', 'Napoleonic', 'France', 'attempting', 'ferret', 'out', 'invasion', 'plans', 'Rock', 'Hudson', 'smuggler', 'who', 'unintentionally', 'plans', 'cover', 'Shot', 'bright', 'Technicolor', 'fun', ""'re"", 'not', 'too', 'demanding', 'Hudson', 'was', 'rise', 'here', 'beginning', 'stardom', 'really', 'top', 'billed', 'De', 'Carlo', 'picture', 'here', 'Maxwell', 'Reed', 'traitorous', 'smuggler', 'Bryan', 'Forbes', 'became', 'director', 'such', 'films', 'THE', 'WHISPERERS', 'Hudson', 'pal', 'co-star.The', 'VCI', 'transfer', 'adequate', 'nothing', 'more']",N/A
