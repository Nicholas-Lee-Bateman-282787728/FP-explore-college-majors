1410711,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B004IFYMWK,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 5]","Telling the true story of CIA agent Valerie Plame, `Fair Game' gets a lot of things right.  I personally haven't seen `Nothing But the Truth', the 2008 adaptation of this account, but from what I hear this particular film is the better of the two.  While I still feel that the first half of the film is too long (it outweighs the second, arguably more important act, and so it should have been trimmed) I can't really fault the film for it definitely builds a strong, and certainly tense, structure from start to finish.  Both Naomi Watts and Sean Penn are in fine form, but it is definitely Watts who carries this film.  You can feel the emotional exhaustion dripping from her face.  The story is poignant and controversial, and one that all Americans should pay attention to.  Valerie Plame was compromised thanks to her husband's blunt opinions, but the lengths went to in order to cover up a governmental illegality was corrupt beyond words.  The strength of the Plame family, while not always understood, is commendable and something we all can learn from.

Valerie Plame Wilson was a CIA operative and she was exposed. Her contacts lives were immediately endangered from that moment on and her marriage suffered a serious blow. Yet there are so many who think she's the one who's ""unpatriotic""! Really?In the end she and her husband were right all along! There was no ""yellow-cake"" shipped to Iraq and this was so expertly demostrated in the movie. And there's STILL no WMD found there 8 years later. It only costs us 4000+ dead soldiers and 10's of thousands of seriously wounded. By that I mean missing legs and arms and worst of all brain injuries. So who's unpatriotic in this story? Oh - and that lame exuse saying ""Saddam was a bad guy and he had to be removed from power"", is the dumbest load of camel dung I have ever heard! There are alot of bad guys who deserve to die, a thousand times over, and no one is even trying to remove them from power!

This took place because her husband, Joe Klein, had written critical things about the administration.  There was a huge public outcry at the time.  This story is extremely well known to all of us who followed it avidly in the news at the time it took place.One would think that with Naomi Watts and Sean Penn cast in those lead roles that this would really crackle on the screen.  It does not.  Because the story is so well known, plot was not going to carry this film entirely.  Thus, the filmmaker needed to approach the guts of the movie in a less linear fashion.  This is what resurrected the whole related field of documentary filmmaking, not ploddingly going from point A to point B to point C.I found myself looking at my watch to see how much longer the film had to go and that is always a very bad sign for a movie goer.Penn and Watts were absolutely phenomenal in 21 GRAMS together so I was looking forward to the same kind of magic here.

1410717,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B004IFYMWK,C. B Collins Jr.,"[0, 0]","This is an entertaining film and also a fascinating picture of the lengths that the Bush White House would go to discredit challenges to the faulty evidence of weapons of mass destruction on which White House policy makers were making their case for an invasion of Iraq. This film does a good job of showing how the White House insiders put pressure on the CIA to cherry pick data so as to build a case for invasion of Iraq. While at the same time former Ambassador Joe Wilson was unraveling their evidence and case, for which he and his wife Valerie Plame paid a price.Naomi Watts plays the role of Valerie Plame, a CIA agent whose cover is blown by the Bush White House in retaliation for her husband&#8217;s evidence and sound arguments that the Iraqis did not have weapons of mass destruction or were building weapons of mass destruction. Now in hindsight it appears that several White House operatives were responsible for the leak to Robert Novak that Plame worked for the CIA and that the CIA had asked Joe Wilson to investigate claims that shipments of yellow-cake uranium were being shipped to Iraq for refinement into weapons.Sean Penn does an excellent job of playing the outspoken Ambassador Joe Wilson who wrote an editorial in the New York Times challenging the truth of a statement in President Bush&#8217;s state of the union address. So the film deals with politics, spies and the pressure placed upon Plame and Wilson that caused considerable tension in their marriage.  Some of the most insightful aspects of the film was the work of Plame as a CIA agent in contacting Iraqi nuclear scientists to determine whether there might be some authenticity to the assertions around weapons development by Sadam Hussein.The film is very entertaining. The acting by Penn and Watts is first rate. The historic significance of these events is still being felt. The film reminds us that American men and women, along with countless Iraqi citizens, died in an invasion based upon faulty evidence misinterpreted by an over-eager White House.",5,We must not forget these events that lead to the invasion of Iraq on false evidence,1390348800,"01 22, 2014",2014,2044,"['entertaining', 'film', 'also', 'fascinating', 'picture', 'lengths', 'Bush', 'White', 'House', 'would', 'go', 'discredit', 'challenges', 'faulty', 'evidence', 'weapons', 'mass', 'destruction', 'White', 'House', 'policy', 'makers', 'were', 'making', 'case', 'invasion', 'Iraq', 'film', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'how', 'White', 'House', 'insiders', 'put', 'pressure', 'CIA', 'cherry', 'pick', 'data', 'so', 'build', 'case', 'invasion', 'Iraq', 'same', 'time', 'former', 'Ambassador', 'Joe', 'Wilson', 'was', 'unraveling', 'evidence', 'case', 'wife', 'Valerie', 'Plame', 'paid', 'price.Naomi', 'Watts', 'role', 'Valerie', 'Plame', 'CIA', 'agent', 'cover', 'blown', 'Bush', 'White', 'House', 'retaliation', 'husband', '8217', 'evidence', 'sound', 'arguments', 'Iraqis', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'weapons', 'mass', 'destruction', 'were', 'building', 'weapons', 'mass', 'destruction', 'Now', 'hindsight', 'several', 'White', 'House', 'operatives', 'were', 'responsible', 'leak', 'Robert', 'Novak', 'Plame', 'worked', 'CIA', 'CIA', 'had', 'asked', 'Joe', 'Wilson', 'investigate', 'claims', 'shipments', 'yellow-cake', 'uranium', 'were', 'being', 'shipped', 'Iraq', 'refinement', 'weapons.Sean', 'Penn', 'excellent', 'job', 'playing', 'outspoken', 'Ambassador', 'Joe', 'Wilson', 'who', 'wrote', 'editorial', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'challenging', 'truth', 'statement', 'President', 'Bush', '8217', 's', 'state', 'union', 'address', 'film', 'deals', 'politics', 'spies', 'pressure', 'placed', 'Plame', 'Wilson', 'caused', 'considerable', 'tension', 'marriage', 'most', 'insightful', 'aspects', 'film', 'was', 'work', 'Plame', 'CIA', 'agent', 'contacting', 'Iraqi', 'nuclear', 'scientists', 'determine', 'might', 'be', 'authenticity', 'assertions', 'weapons', 'development', 'Sadam', 'Hussein.The', 'film', 'very', 'entertaining', 'acting', 'Penn', 'Watts', 'first', 'rate', 'historic', 'significance', 'events', 'still', 'being', 'felt', 'film', 'American', 'men', 'women', 'countless', 'Iraqi', 'citizens', 'died', 'invasion', 'based', 'faulty', 'evidence', 'misinterpreted', 'over-eager', 'White', 'House']",Fair Game

In this case, her husband who was exposing the bare-faced lies that the Bush administration was using to start the Iraq war, a war that wasn't and still isn't in this country's best interests (just like Vietnam).

1410720,ALLIGF5OZM1I6,B004IFYMWK,Craig Whittle,"[86, 102]","FAIR GAMESTARRING: Naomi Watts, Sean Penn, Ty Burrell, Brooke Smith, Thomas McCarthy, Jessica Hecht, Noah Emmerich, Bruce McGill and Sam ShepardWRITTEN BY: Jez Butterworth and John Henry Butterworth; based on the books, The Politics of Truth, by Joseph Wilson, and Fair Game by Valerie PlameDIRECTED BY: Doug LimanRated: PG - 13Genre: DramaRelease Date: 05 November 2010Review Date: 09 November 2010A very rewarding and not highly practiced treat in cinema, is sitting down in your seat at a theater and having no idea what kind of movie you're about to watch; not the premise, not the rating, not the genre.I've been fortunate to do this a few times and it can be awesome. If you're wondering how you can do this, well - every once in a while for whatever reason, a studio will release a film with A-list talent but only put it in a selected handful of theaters across the country. As such was the case for me when I drove 15 miles to see Fair Game at my city's `artsy' theater, knowing only that it was the new Sean Penn.I was also surprised to learn at the film's close, that it was based very largely on a true story. Fair Game shows a couple who was sabotaged by the media when they exposed that the government had blatantly lied about where Iraq may or may not have gotten their supposed nuclear warheads, way back at the brink of the Iraq war.Now before you get all fussy due to the touchy political subject matter, RELAX. I'm a proud American and served in the Military and I didn't find the film offensive. We are all aware that Sean Penn is known for voicing his lefty political views rather radically; but I strongly think 99 percent of us with brain stems will agree with his character's speech at the end of the film.This movie isn't about bashing Bush or his administration and it's not about being anti-American and painting a portrait that displays Iraqi terrorists as the good guys and us as the bad guys. If anything, it's a film showcasing both our beautiful God-given rights to freedom of speech and that if you KNOW firsthand that someone lied, then you may want to do something about it; sometimes no matter what the cost.I'm not going to say whether or not the film is 100 percent accurate because I don't know that and you don't know that. Hell, the filmmakers probably don't even know that. But we ALL know that things were shady to say the least for a while there, and that surely somewhere, SOMEONE lied - big or small, they did; and it was most likely more than one person.Anyway - Fair Game shows us a character named Joe Wilson (Sean Penn) who volunteered to go to Africa on behalf of the CIA's request, to investigate if and or how weapons of mass destruction could have been shipped from there. The film shows us very clearly, that they could not have been. Our character knows this. Oh, and he was asked to do this by the way, because his wife Valerie (Naomi Watts) is a CIA operative, and Joe has some experience in this field, the details of which I'll leave for you to discover.When Joe returns, he is baffled to soon learn that we are going to war, and that the President and the Pentagon have more or less claimed that it was proven that these WMDs did in fact come from Africa, and that Iraq has them and that we need to step in. Being one of, if not THEE only American who knows this to be not true, Joe naturally feels a duty to report this. So he writes and article, has it published and all hell breaks loose for him and his wife, and that's all I'm going to tell.There are however, a slew of small additional things to mention to you. The acting is sensational; specifically from both Penn and Watts, no shocker there I'm sure. The cinematography is terrific as is the direction by Doug Liman who also brought us The Bourne Identity and Mr. and Mrs. Smith. And the film is brilliantly written and it displays scenes of realistic moments we can all relate to; such as political discussions at a dinner table with friends or family who are quick to run their mouths about things of which they have no personal experience with. You know, dinners where everyone at the table is an expert and can solve all the world's problems? Yeah, dinners like that.If anything, aside from being entertaining from start to finish, Fair Game is a movie that makes you think. It makes us realize how the media will often twist and skew things to be interpreted the way they see fit; and don't worry - I'm not blind to the fact that Hollywood does this as well.Although the odds are high that it will never happen to you or me, each and every one of us could be `fair game' to the media or the government's vendetta driven shenanigans at any moment. But what's great about America, and what this film is trying to convey to us, is that thanks to our amazing Constitution... the media and government can be fair game as well.",5,Fair Game

CIA operative Valerie Plame (Naomi Watts) is sent to Iraq under cover to find out the truth. She persuades several of the Iraqi physicists involved in the program to defect to America. She makes it clear back home however that there are no WMD.

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[4, 6]","FAIR GAME (2010) is the story of Valerie Plame Wilson (Naomi Watts), the outed CIA agent that seems to have been the powder-keg issue vis-&agrave;-vis the Iraqi War. Directed by Doug Liman, FAIR GAME tells the story of a tiny part of Valerie's job, digs a bit deeper regarding her husband, former Ambassador Joe Wilson (a great Sean Penn), and what the government did to these two people, to say nothing of what they did to Valerie's live-ops, assets and the rest.""If by not keeping quiet while someone spouts obnoxious crap makes you an a**hole, then I'm an a**hole ... "" -Joe Wilson""You have to know why you're lying, and never forget the truth.""-Valerie WilsonWe may not all recall the story of outed CIA agent Valerie Plame Wilson, but this film will tell you all you need to know. We'll see her at work undercover with the CIA, we'll see Joe Wilson and his activism circa 2001, and we'll see the Bush Administration eat them both alive. Yet they fight, the truth is out, Scooter Libby takes the fall and as Wilson predicts, he got his sentence commuted by Bush. Karl Rove, as expected, also walked from a grand jury indictment.This grand performance by Naomi Watts punctuates the fact that this country's heroes are everyday type of people. At the end, Watts begins her testimony to the Committee on Government Oversight and Reform ... within seconds, TV footage of the real Valerie takes over, and it is MOVING.I loved seeing Penn standing before the Memorial Wall in the CIA with all its nameless charcoal stars commemorating the CIA fallen. It is highly significant. I also liked the way he shoots down loudmouths with withering, blistering one-liners; I was very moved when he began writing his famous article for the ""New York Times"", ""What I Didn't Find in Africa"" - the item that got him into so much hot water.Scooter Libby's vendetta ... Karl Rove's evil brainstorm ... the Bush Administration's lies and Condoleezza Rice appearing in a newscast spewing those lies as the administration's mouthpiece ... it's all here. I also loved the positive showing of MSNBC, and hearing an actor portraying Chris Matthews as he calls Joe to talk with him. MSNBC broke a lot of REAL news on this, and I like that it is showcased here. Mathhews does not appear as himself here, only an actor playing him is heard on the phone with Joe, but Andrea Mitchell of MSNBC was the first to contact the Wilson's to break the story and that is mentioned.Now for the bad: aside from Penn's grey streaks on occasion turning blond for some mysterious reason, his acting is pitch-perfect. At least, Penn seems perfect from what I've seen of former Ambassador Wilson. This film also takes the annoying tack of the bobble-head cinematography, as if the dialogue needs to be punctuated with bad camera work. I wish to the cinema gods that Hitchcock had not invented dialogue-on-top-of-dialogue, because the first 30 minutes of this is a lot of yelling on top of yelling.There are also too many muffled, swallowed or drowned-out lines of dialogue, and all I can say is take the sound man out back and beat the proverbial out of him! This film could have done with some slightly better pacing and less preaching at the audience, as is the wont of the left when they want to drive home a particular point. When I see this type of catastrophe, I get tired of the left blaming me: it feels personal after a while.There are two things we'll never know from this film: why are we in Iraq? And perhaps worse, why did everyone refer to Valerie as ""Ms. Plame""? For all the bad, I deducted one star.With that off my chest, I'd say give this a couple of careful viewings and use your closed-captioning or subtitles.

1410727,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,B004IFYMWK,Erik North,"[3, 6]","Much of the rationale given by the Bush Administration for America going to war against Iraq and Saddam Hussein at the end of the winter of 2003 centered around claims made by British intelligence officials that Hussein's regime sought out mass quantities of yellowcake uranium from the country of Niger in western Africa.  Those claims had been put into the State of the Union speech that Bush had given in January of that year.  As it turned out, though, those claims, when thoroughly investigated, turned out to be untrue.  Subsequently, a high-level couple, ambassador Joe Wilson and his wife, CIA operative Valerie Plame, were outed by cronies inside the Bush White House and placed in the middle of a firestorm in which anyone attempting to discredit the Bush Administration in any small way was censured in the press.  It is their fight that was depicted in the 2010 film FAIR GAME.Watts and Penn portray the real-life couple at the center of this firestorm.  Penn, as ambassador Wilson, investigates the claims about yellowcake uranium and aluminum tubing supposedly being used to make nuclear weapons being exported between Niger and Iraq back in the late 1990s, as it appears that America is on the brink of ousting Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq.  Meanwhile, Watts, as Valerie Plame, makes it her business to get reliable sources of Iraq's intelligence out of there to give the CIA the proper information.  Penn asserts that such a trade of uranium not only could not have occurred, but that the aluminum tubing in question is not of the kind that would be suitable for doing what the Bush Administration says Hussein intends it for--to create a nuclear bomb.  Thus, the rationale for going to war in Iraq has just been rendered fraudulent, but a little too late for those Iraqi civilians and U.S. soldiers caught in the middle.  Even so, however, Watts' name and status are both exposed in the media from within the bowels of the administration, rendering her damaged goods, and infuriating Penn.The other significant thing the whole imbroglio causes is a huge schism between the couple, since Watts is initially unwilling to fight back while Penn makes the rounds on the networks to tell the truth of the matter.  The allegations against both of them mount in the press, which keeps hounding them for their alleged lack of patriotism; and finally, both of them come out of the shadows to tell their side of the story.  Watts manages to make her decision after having a talk with her father (Shepherd), a veteran of the Vietnam War who, because of his military life, had to move both himself and his family to twenty different locales around the world and America.  And while they didn't come out of the imbroglio completely unscathed in the media, in the end, the Bush Administration and its minions didn't either.Incisively directed by Doug Liman, who was responsible for the 2002 Robert Ludlum adaptation THE BOURNE IDENTITY, FAIR GAME is a powerful expose of the Iraq war as seen through the eyes and experiences of its most noted diplomatic figures, every bit as powerful a political film as any, documentary or otherwise, made since 9/11, and, indeed, every bit as thorough as films like ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN and THIRTEEN DAYS.  While there are political considerations to be considered in this film, especially give that Penn was one of the most ferocious and outspoken critics anywhere of the Bush Administation from the beginning, this is equally a hard-hitting character study as well; and Penn and Watts do an excellent job of portraying the beleaguered Wilsons, while a whole host of good character actors are superb in their roles of the dark underlings that work for Team Bush.  Liman, who also does the cinematography, shoots FAIR GAME in a very documentary-like style, and in the same bleached-color visuals that were a trademark of Spielberg's SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, MINORITY REPORT, and MUNICH.Both Valerie Plane and Joe Wilson risked everything they had to get the truth out there about the Bush Administration's dissembling with regards to a non-existent connection between Saddam Hussein and 9/11; and FAIR GAME is an excellent film depicting that struggle, clearly one of the best films of 2010.",5,Getting The Truth Out...At A Great Cost,1303430400,"04 22, 2011",2011,4233,"['Much', 'rationale', 'given', 'Bush', 'Administration', 'America', 'going', 'war', 'Iraq', 'Saddam', 'Hussein', 'end', 'winter', '2003', 'centered', 'claims', 'made', 'British', 'intelligence', 'officials', 'Hussein', 'regime', 'sought', 'out', 'mass', 'quantities', 'yellowcake', 'uranium', 'country', 'Niger', 'western', 'Africa', 'claims', 'had', 'been', 'put', 'State', 'Union', 'speech', 'Bush', 'had', 'given', 'January', 'year', 'turned', 'out', 'though', 'claims', 'when', 'thoroughly', 'investigated', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'untrue', 'Subsequently', 'high-level', 'couple', 'ambassador', 'Joe', 'Wilson', 'wife', 'CIA', 'operative', 'Valerie', 'Plame', 'were', 'outed', 'cronies', 'Bush', 'White', 'House', 'placed', 'middle', 'firestorm', 'anyone', 'attempting', 'discredit', 'Bush', 'Administration', 'small', 'way', 'was', 'censured', 'press', 'fight', 'was', 'depicted', '2010', 'film', 'FAIR', 'GAME.Watts', 'Penn', 'portray', 'real-life', 'couple', 'center', 'firestorm', 'Penn', 'ambassador', 'Wilson', 'claims', 'yellowcake', 'uranium', 'aluminum', 'tubing', 'supposedly', 'being', 'used', 'make', 'nuclear', 'weapons', 'being', 'exported', 'Niger', 'Iraq', 'back', 'late', '1990s', 'America', 'brink', 'ousting', 'Saddam', 'Hussein', 'power', 'Iraq', 'Meanwhile', 'Watts', 'Valerie', 'Plame', 'business', 'get', 'reliable', 'sources', 'Iraq', 'intelligence', 'give', 'CIA', 'proper', 'information', 'Penn', 'trade', 'uranium', 'not', 'only', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'occurred', 'aluminum', 'tubing', 'question', 'not', 'kind', 'would', 'be', 'suitable', 'doing', 'what', 'Bush', 'Administration', 'Hussein', 'create', 'nuclear', 'bomb', 'Thus', 'rationale', 'going', 'war', 'Iraq', 'just', 'been', 'rendered', 'fraudulent', 'little', 'too', 'late', 'Iraqi', 'civilians', 'U.S.', 'soldiers', 'caught', 'middle', 'Even', 'so', 'however', 'Watts', 'name', 'status', 'are', 'exposed', 'media', 'bowels', 'administration', 'rendering', 'damaged', 'goods', 'infuriating', 'Penn.The', 'other', 'significant', 'thing', 'whole', 'imbroglio', 'huge', 'schism', 'couple', 'Watts', 'initially', 'unwilling', 'fight', 'back', 'Penn', 'rounds', 'networks', 'tell', 'truth', 'matter', 'allegations', 'mount', 'press', 'hounding', 'alleged', 'lack', 'patriotism', 'finally', 'come', 'shadows', 'tell', 'side', 'story', 'Watts', 'make', 'decision', 'having', 'talk', 'father', 'Shepherd', 'veteran', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'who', 'military', 'life', 'had', 'move', 'family', 'twenty', 'different', 'locales', 'world', 'America', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'imbroglio', 'completely', 'unscathed', 'media', 'end', 'Bush', 'Administration', 'minions', 'did', ""n't"", 'either.Incisively', 'directed', 'Doug', 'Liman', 'who', 'was', 'responsible', '2002', 'Robert', 'Ludlum', 'adaptation', 'THE', 'BOURNE', 'IDENTITY', 'FAIR', 'GAME', 'powerful', 'expose', 'Iraq', 'war', 'seen', 'eyes', 'experiences', 'most', 'noted', 'diplomatic', 'figures', 'bit', 'powerful', 'political', 'film', 'documentary', 'otherwise', 'made', '9/11', 'indeed', 'bit', 'as', 'thorough', 'films', 'THE', 'PRESIDENT', 'MEN', 'THIRTEEN', 'DAYS', 'are', 'political', 'considerations', 'be', 'considered', 'film', 'especially', 'give', 'Penn', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'ferocious', 'outspoken', 'critics', 'anywhere', 'Bush', 'Administation', 'beginning', 'equally', 'hard-hitting', 'character', 'study', 'well', 'Penn', 'Watts', 'do', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'beleaguered', 'Wilsons', 'whole', 'host', 'good', 'character', 'actors', 'are', 'superb', 'roles', 'dark', 'underlings', 'work', 'Team', 'Bush', 'Liman', 'who', 'also', 'cinematography', 'shoots', 'FAIR', 'GAME', 'very', 'documentary-like', 'style', 'same', 'bleached-color', 'visuals', 'were', 'trademark', 'Spielberg', 'SAVING', 'PRIVATE', 'RYAN', 'MINORITY', 'REPORT', 'MUNICH.Both', 'Valerie', 'Plane', 'Joe', 'Wilson', 'risked', 'everything', 'had', 'get', 'truth', 'there', 'Bush', 'Administration', 'dissembling', 'regards', 'non-existent', 'connection', 'Saddam', 'Hussein', '9/11', 'FAIR', 'GAME', 'excellent', 'film', 'depicting', 'struggle', 'clearly', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2010']",Fair Game

1410732,A328S9RN3U5M68,B004IFYMWK,Grady Harp,"[5, 8]","FAIR GAME serves several purposes; it is a thriller of a suspense movie that entertains, it addresses one of the most controversial aspects of American military action in years, and it dares to open the secret doors of the Bush Administration.  Based on the book 'The Politics of Truth' by Joseph Wilson the film has been summarized as follows: 'Joseph Charles Wilson IV (born November 6, 1949) is a former United States diplomat best known for his 2002 trip to Niger to investigate allegations that Saddam Hussein was attempting to purchase yellowcake uranium; his New York Times op ed piece, ""What I Didn't Find in Niger""; and the subsequent ""outing"" of his wife Valerie Plame as a CIA agent.' and the book ""Fair Game' by Valerie Plame. The books have been transformed into a bitingly vital screenplay by Jez and John-Henry Butterworth and the film is searingly directed by Doug Lyman.Why the film didn't enjoy a better success in the theaters is likely due to the still festering difference of opinion as to the pre-emptive war on Iraq, a war declared because of the 'evidence' that Iraq had Weapons of Mass destruction that is now approaching 10 years in activity despite the embarrassingly early declaration by that the war had been 'won' soon after declaration.  What FAIR GAME offers is Wilson's defense of his wife Valerie Plame's role in the CIA and how the government dealt with the coverup and smoke screen and other shenanigans by Karl Rove, Scooter Libby and other White House officials who revealed Plame's status as a CIA agent and were allegedly out to discredit her husband after he wrote a 2003 New York Times op-ed piece saying that the Bush administration had manipulated intelligence about weapons of mass destruction to justify the invasion of Iraq.The actors are consistently superb throughout the large cast - Naomi Watts as Valerie Plame, Sean Penn as Joe Wilson, Bruce McGill as Jim Pavitt, Adam LeFevre as Karl Rove, David Andrews as Scooter Libby - and the many film clips of President Bush's televised speeches and statements from VP  Dick Cheney et al add credence to the atmosphere.  It is a film about the value of truth and as such it makes us all think more carefully about our current further involvement in the many battles currently being fought in the countries of the Middle East.  There is a speech Joe Wilson gives to his class at the end of the film that challenges his students to always defend democracy - the legacy of our Founding Fathers - and it is this speech that is the most compelling writing in the film.  A fine cast delivers a compelling film and it is a film all Americans should see.

The story is well-known and is dramatized very well in this film.President Bush insisted that the US should bomb Iraq because the country has weapons of mass destruction. A retired American ambassador was asked by the CIA to look into the matter and found that this was not true. President Bush ignored the CIA finding and insisted that Iraq had such weapons and had the US military attack Iraq. The ambassador published an article in a newspaper stating that there were no such weapons. The White House admitted that he was correct, but childishly and inappropriately struck back at the ambassador by illegally revealing that his wife was an undercover CIA agent. The film shows how this White House action destroyed the innocent woman's career, placed great strains upon her marriage, and forced the CIA to abandon the non-American agents that worked under her, many of whom lost their lives.",5,An important portrayal of infamy,1337644800,"05 22, 2012",2012,1282,"['suspense-filled', 'action-thriller', 'real-life', 'depiction', 'despicable', 'chapter', 'dark', 'side', 'US', 'political', 'life', 'story', 'how', 'thousands', 'lives', 'were', 'lost', 'due', 'lies', 'underpinned', 'Iraq', 'War', 'how', 'one', 'family', 'who', 'revealed', 'lie', 'were', 'destroyed', 'officials', 'American', 'White', 'House', 'perhaps', 'direction', 'president', 'vice', 'president', 'United', 'States', 'story', 'well-known', 'dramatized', 'very', 'well', 'film.President', 'Bush', 'insisted', 'US', 'should', 'bomb', 'Iraq', 'country', 'weapons', 'mass', 'destruction', 'retired', 'American', 'ambassador', 'was', 'asked', 'CIA', 'look', 'matter', 'found', 'was', 'not', 'true', 'President', 'Bush', 'ignored', 'CIA', 'finding', 'insisted', 'Iraq', 'had', 'such', 'weapons', 'had', 'US', 'military', 'attack', 'Iraq', 'ambassador', 'published', 'article', 'newspaper', 'stating', 'were', 'such', 'weapons', 'White', 'House', 'admitted', 'was', 'correct', 'childishly', 'inappropriately', 'struck', 'back', 'ambassador', 'illegally', 'revealing', 'wife', 'was', 'undercover', 'CIA', 'agent', 'film', 'how', 'White', 'House', 'action', 'destroyed', 'innocent', 'woman', 'career', 'placed', 'great', 'strains', 'marriage', 'forced', 'CIA', 'abandon', 'non-American', 'agents', 'worked', 'many', 'whom', 'lost', 'lives']",Fair Game

Danzig,"[16, 20]","Some have compared this film to ""All the President's Men"", which told of the travails of the intrepid reporters who unraveled the Watergate scandal.There's one large and tragic difference between that story and the one told in ""Fair Game"".  Watergate forced Richard Nixon to resign his office in disgrace.  The treasonous activities perpetrated by Bush, Cheney, and their cronies have had all but no repercussions.Bush now makes thousands speaking at company functions.  Cheney is about to release a book justifying his misdeeds.  And Bush commuted the sentence of the one guy who took a fall for the ""Plamegate"" scandal, Cheney's operative Scooter Libby.Make no mistake.  The story told in ""Fair Game"" captures one of the darkest hours in American history.  The leaders of our nation launched a war of aggression on another country, attempting to justify their actions based on the flimsiest web of false information.When one courageous citizen, former ambassador Joe Wilson, spoke out about the campaign of deceit waged by the White House, the White House exposed his wife, Valerie Plame, as a CIA operative, and attempted to discredit the couple in a wave of lies and vitriol that lasted four long years.Any American, either on the right or left, who cares about ""truth, justice, and the American way"" should be outraged and disgusted by what went on here.  This movie does a valuable service in dramatizing and focusing a complicated story obscured in real life by the fog of disinformation into a taut hour-and-forty-five minute drama.This DVD also brings more to the story than the original theatrical release, because the disc includes illuminating commentary by Joe Wilson and Valerie Plame.  Their testimony gives the film a stamp of unimpeachable veracity unlike the flim flam concocted by the Bush administration in its helter-skelter runup to the Iraq War.Happily, the couple now seem happy and proud of their courageous actions, but they also remark how watching the film brings back some terrible recollections, especially when they see the footage the film contains of the warmongers spewing their pathetic lies on camera.Bush, Cheney, Peter King, Condoleeza Rice, and others should all be ashamed and shunned for the rest of their lives by all true Americans.The performances by Naomi Watts and Sean Penn as the embattled couple are impeccable, and indeed Plame and Wilson both say what accurate portrayals of themselves are on display here.In my opinion, this film should be required viewing by all school children here in the United States for generations to come.

1410742,A19K46GITRI5Y2,B004IFYMWK,Joyce,"[0, 0]","Fair Game is based on the true story of CIA agent Valerie Plame, who shares some of the qualities exhibited by Gary Oldham's character in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.  Both are stunningly skilled operatives.  Most of the story you know:  The Bush administration had decided to go to war in Iraq.  Seeking reasons to justify an attack, it seized on a report that the nation of Niger (not Nigeria) had sold uranium to Iraq.  Joseph Wilson, a former ambassador to Niger, was sent to seek such evidence.  He found none.  In fact, he learned that such sales would have been physically impossible.  His report was ignored.  War was begun using the nonexistent uranium sales as cause.  He wrote an article in the New York Times reporting the truth.  In order to discredit him, someone in the administration leaked the information to Chicago Sun-Times columnist Robert Novak that Wilson's wife, Valerie Plame, was a CIA agent.  Eventually, Cheney aide, Scooter Libby, was tried and convicted of obstruction of justice and perjury, sentenced to prison, and had his sentence commuted by Bush.  The part of the story you probably do not know was the ""collateral"" damage.  Plame's sensitive work in the Middle East was disrupted and as many as 70 of her informants were killed.  The Plame-Wilson family (including young twins) came close to breakup.Naomi Watts and Sean Penn are excellent as Plame and Wilson, even looking remarkably like them.  The film does not change the names of any principals, uses actual footage of administrative figures, and even closes with footage of Plame herself testifying before congress.  Here are a couple of ifs:  If Wilson had kept quiet, Plame's CIA work wouldn't have been destroyed.  On the other hand, if the Bush administration hadn't suppressed Wilson's information and smeared Wilson and Plame, there might have been no Iraq War.

A beautiful wife and mother, married to a diplomat, she has a day job, and she's a CIA spy. It's a true life version of something like ""True Lies.""It is a story we all saw unfold on the news and Sunday morning news shows in 2003. Plame's husband, diplomat Joseph Wilson is asked by Vice President Dick Cheney's office to go to Niger to investigate whether 50 tons of yellow cake uranium was secretly sold to Saddam Hussein. While at the CIA Valerie is involved the controversy of whether aluminum rods sold to Hussein are meant for the enrichment of uranium to make nuclear weapons. Both are discovered to be unfounded, both are answers the White House didn't want to invalidate their effort for a war with Iraq. The Bush administration sent Scooter Libby over to the CIA to try and intimidate the CIA into providing the answers they wanted about WMD. In response to President George Bush's State of the Union address in which he said Niger sold the yellow cake uranium to Iraq, Wilson writes an opinion piece that contradicts the President's assertion and the next thing they knew, Plame was outed as a CIA field agent, and it appeared the leak came from the White House in an attempt to discredit Wilson and Plame.As Wilson, Sean Penn turns in a performance where he disappears into the role without totally disappearing. Being the consumate actor that he is, Penn doesn't offer an impersonation of Wilson but delivers the sense of Wilson through his mannerisms, and that's what really sells the believability of the character Penn has created. Naomi Watts looks like she could be Valerie Plame's younger sister, and turns in one of the better performances of her career. David Andrews as Scooter Libby conveys all the condescending arrogance, not only of the Bush administration but of power. Adam LeFevre does a good Karl Rove. Sam Shepard does a cameo as Plame's father and provides a nice moment as the voice of reason providing her character with sage advice and perspective. President George W. Bush is shown in news footage.Director Doug Liman who directed ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" realistically shows the flip side of ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" they could be bookends, one that shows a fantastical husband and wife spy team, and one that realistically portrays a couple in that situation. ""Fair Game"" is a low key antidote to the fantasy. Limon also shows the repercussions of Plame's outing not only in the Wilsons' relationship but in the bigger picture that with Plame's outing, U.S. officials knowingly exposed her contacts and they ""disappeared.""In the end ""Fair Game"" is the story of a family withstanding the most divisive forces brought to bare to divide and conquer Plame and Wilson. In the beginning of ""Fair Game"" Plame and Wilson have to live their lives as a lie. But in the end it is the truth that saves them.The only bonus feature is a commentary by Wilson and Plame which is good when the corroborate the factual in the film.",4,Spies Like Us,1301356800,"03 29, 2011",2011,3019,"['Valerie', 'Plame', 'could', 'have', 'stepped', 'spy', 'novel', 'Hollywood', 'thriller', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'mother', 'married', 'diplomat', 'day', 'job', 'CIA', 'spy', 'true', 'life', 'version', 'something', 'True', 'Lies', 'story', 'saw', 'unfold', 'news', 'Sunday', 'morning', 'news', 'shows', '2003', 'Plame', 'husband', 'diplomat', 'Joseph', 'Wilson', 'asked', 'Vice', 'President', 'Dick', 'Cheney', 'office', 'go', 'Niger', 'investigate', '50', 'tons', 'yellow', 'cake', 'uranium', 'was', 'secretly', 'sold', 'Saddam', 'Hussein', 'CIA', 'Valerie', 'involved', 'controversy', 'aluminum', 'rods', 'sold', 'Hussein', 'are', 'meant', 'enrichment', 'uranium', 'make', 'nuclear', 'weapons', 'are', 'discovered', 'be', 'unfounded', 'are', 'White', 'House', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'invalidate', 'effort', 'war', 'Iraq', 'Bush', 'administration', 'sent', 'Scooter', 'Libby', 'CIA', 'try', 'intimidate', 'CIA', 'providing', 'answers', 'wanted', 'WMD', 'response', 'President', 'George', 'Bush', 'State', 'Union', 'address', 'said', 'Niger', 'sold', 'yellow', 'cake', 'uranium', 'Iraq', 'Wilson', 'opinion', 'piece', 'President', 'assertion', 'next', 'thing', 'knew', 'Plame', 'was', 'outed', 'CIA', 'field', 'agent', 'appeared', 'leak', 'came', 'White', 'House', 'attempt', 'discredit', 'Wilson', 'Plame.As', 'Wilson', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'performance', 'where', 'role', 'totally', 'disappearing', 'Being', 'consumate', 'actor', 'Penn', ""n't"", 'offer', 'impersonation', 'Wilson', 'sense', 'Wilson', 'mannerisms', 'what', 'really', 'believability', 'character', 'Penn', 'created', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'could', 'be', 'Valerie', 'Plame', 'younger', 'sister', 'one', 'better', 'performances', 'career', 'David', 'Andrews', 'Scooter', 'Libby', 'conveys', 'condescending', 'arrogance', 'not', 'only', 'Bush', 'administration', 'power', 'Adam', 'LeFevre', 'good', 'Karl', 'Rove', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'cameo', 'Plame', 'father', 'nice', 'moment', 'voice', 'reason', 'providing', 'character', 'sage', 'advice', 'perspective', 'President', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'shown', 'news', 'footage.Director', 'Doug', 'Liman', 'who', 'directed', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'realistically', 'flip', 'side', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'could', 'be', 'bookends', 'one', 'fantastical', 'husband', 'wife', 'spy', 'team', 'one', 'realistically', 'couple', 'situation', 'Fair', 'Game', 'low', 'key', 'antidote', 'fantasy', 'Limon', 'also', 'repercussions', 'Plame', 'outing', 'not', 'only', 'Wilsons', 'relationship', 'bigger', 'picture', 'Plame', 'outing', 'U.S.', 'officials', 'knowingly', 'exposed', 'contacts', 'disappeared', 'end', 'Fair', 'Game', 'story', 'family', 'withstanding', 'most', 'divisive', 'forces', 'brought', 'bare', 'divide', 'conquer', 'Plame', 'Wilson', 'beginning', 'Fair', 'Game', 'Plame', 'Wilson', 'have', 'live', 'lives', 'lie', 'end', 'truth', 'them.The', 'only', 'bonus', 'feature', 'commentary', 'Wilson', 'Plame', 'good', 'when', 'corroborate', 'factual', 'film']",Fair Game

When I saw this DVD in the video store, it had completely missed my radar screen.  The film will be controversial for some because of the politics and the historical recency of the Bush administration and the Iraq war.  As a film, it has been derided because of its emphasis on the relationship between Wilson and his wife.  While my perception is that the film balances well between the politics and intrigue of the Iraq War and the home situation, it is made FAR more interesting because it so greatly points out the impact the events had on a real family.  It also points to the value of the individual to stand up and say what is true in a democracy; reference the scene Sean Penn addresses a class at the end.  Sean Penn is a Master actor.  I never would have predicted this when I watched ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High,"" but with the choices he has made and the incredible diversity from performances in ""Milk,"" ""I Am Sam"" and ""Mystic River,"" now I ALWAYS watch his work.  He does an amazing job in ""Fair Game,"" showing us a driven civil servant who stands up for what he believes is right and a husband in love with his wife.  I also greatly appreciated the blending of reality that Liman does by having clips from the real-life Valerie Plame as well as the media footage of Condoleezza Rice talking about aluminum tubes.  It's so well done.  Naomi Watts turns in a strong performance in a challenging role that demanded a wide range of emotional territory.  The scene where the two reclaim their marriage is powerful and reflects for me how even names we see in the news are people.  David Andrews as Scooter Libby was sufficiently creepy.

1410753,A9ETYHQDJLAHZ,B004IFYMWK,Martin L,"[3, 5]","The video and audio on this blu ray are excellent. What really bears comment if the film itself.  ""Fair Game"" is the true story of Valarie Plame Wilson, a covert CIA agent and her husband, former ambassador  Joe Wilson.  Leading up to the 2003 war in Iraq, was the concern that Saddam Hussein was gearing up to produce nuclear weapons.  And at the request of the Vice President's office, the CIA asked Joe Wilson to go on a fact finding trip to Niger (the presumed location of the purchase by Iraqi agents of a form of uranium called ""yellow cake"").  Wilson was previously an ambassador under Presidents GHW Bush and Clinton and knew the area well. His findings were in fact that rumors of such purchases were false and he reported such.When GW Bush launched the war against Iraq, the rationale was based principally on the Iraqi possession of such weapons of mass destruction.  When that lie was perpetuated by Bush in his State of the Union address (the now infamous ""sixteen words""), Joe Wilson spoke out in a Op-ed piece in the Washington Post.  And from that point on, members of the Bush administration, from Dick Cheney on down, sought to discredit Joe Wilson by exposing his wife (Valarie Plame Wilson) as a covert CIA operative.  And they further attempted to assassinate the character and reputation of both by claiming that his wife had sent Joe Wilson on the trip as a junket.The official records are now clear (after the Fitzgerald investigation and the indictment of Scooter Libby) that Joe Wilson was telling the truth as he exposed one of the biggest lies in the history of U.S. foreign policy one that lead to biggest foreign policy disaster since the Vietnam war----namely the Iraqi war.  Libby was convicted of  lying and obstruction of justice.  Bush took care of his own by commuting Libby's sentence, but he did not pardon him.This film is a story of patriotism and bravery; and it also the story for abuse of power, treachery and deceit.",5,Riveting Film,1312070400,"07 31, 2011",2011,1960,"['video', 'audio', 'blu', 'ray', 'are', 'excellent', 'What', 'really', 'comment', 'film', 'Fair', 'Game', 'true', 'story', 'Valarie', 'Plame', 'Wilson', 'covert', 'CIA', 'agent', 'husband', 'former', 'ambassador', 'Joe', 'Wilson', 'Leading', 'up', '2003', 'war', 'Iraq', 'was', 'concern', 'Saddam', 'Hussein', 'was', 'gearing', 'up', 'produce', 'nuclear', 'weapons', 'request', 'Vice', 'President', 'office', 'CIA', 'asked', 'Joe', 'Wilson', 'go', 'fact', 'finding', 'trip', 'Niger', 'presumed', 'location', 'purchase', 'Iraqi', 'agents', 'form', 'uranium', 'called', 'yellow', 'cake', 'Wilson', 'was', 'previously', 'ambassador', 'Presidents', 'GHW', 'Bush', 'Clinton', 'knew', 'area', 'well', 'findings', 'were', 'fact', 'rumors', 'such', 'purchases', 'were', 'false', 'reported', 'such.When', 'GW', 'Bush', 'launched', 'war', 'Iraq', 'rationale', 'was', 'based', 'principally', 'Iraqi', 'possession', 'such', 'weapons', 'mass', 'destruction', 'When', 'lie', 'was', 'perpetuated', 'Bush', 'State', 'Union', 'address', 'now', 'infamous', 'sixteen', 'words', 'Joe', 'Wilson', 'spoke', 'out', 'Op-ed', 'piece', 'Washington', 'Post', 'point', 'members', 'Bush', 'administration', 'Dick', 'Cheney', 'down', 'sought', 'discredit', 'Joe', 'Wilson', 'exposing', 'wife', 'Valarie', 'Plame', 'Wilson', 'covert', 'CIA', 'operative', 'further', 'attempted', 'assassinate', 'character', 'reputation', 'claiming', 'wife', 'had', 'sent', 'Joe', 'Wilson', 'trip', 'junket.The', 'official', 'records', 'are', 'now', 'clear', 'Fitzgerald', 'investigation', 'indictment', 'Scooter', 'Libby', 'Joe', 'Wilson', 'was', 'telling', 'truth', 'exposed', 'one', 'biggest', 'lies', 'history', 'U.S.', 'foreign', 'policy', 'one', 'lead', 'biggest', 'foreign', 'policy', 'disaster', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'namely', 'Iraqi', 'war', 'Libby', 'was', 'convicted', 'lying', 'obstruction', 'justice', 'Bush', 'took', 'care', 'own', 'commuting', 'Libby', 'sentence', 'did', 'not', 'pardon', 'him.This', 'film', 'story', 'patriotism', 'bravery', 'also', 'story', 'abuse', 'power', 'treachery', 'deceit']",Fair Game

Like Valerie Plame.  Highly respected CIA agent and clearly the most valued member of the organization, she nevertheless continued to do the grunt-work, running dozens of spies in Iraq. The beautiful and intelligent ones.  With charming accents.And her husband, Joe Wilson.  They had a great marriage.  Wow.  Did they have a great marriage.  They loved each other and joked with each other and hugged and kissed and had two wonderful children.Joe was a real man, a stubborn man.  When he went to Niger--Ni-Jhair--and spent ""eight"" days in a hotel there, ""sipping sweet mint tea"" and interviewing Niger officials, he could not help but conclude that there was no way that they could possibly have been shipping or attempting to ship yellow cake uranium to Iraq.  He spent EIGHT DAYS there.  With his friends.  In a hotel.  Gosh, can you possibly doubt him?Well, the movie kind of glosses over this.  You have to read Joe's book or his article to know how long he spent there.  But the movie is still true.  Dammit.So he came home from Niger after being sent there by the Vice President's office--well he now admits it wasn't the Vice President's office;  it was the CIA!--and he submitted his confidential written report.  Whoops!  The movie doesn't mention that there was no written report to the CIA.  Soo, hmm, the CIA sends Wilson to Niger to find out if Niger was selling or going to sell yellow cake uranium to Saddam and he, uhh, never submits a written report when he returns.  No written report.  Nothing.  He says he instead had a meeting with someone.  The movie kinda forgot about this, too.He does submit a report though--his first written one--to the New York Times.  How nice!  Everyone can read it!  The CIA of course is in the business of sending agents to far-off African countries to obtain secret information to be used by the American government for the health and welfare of all American citizens so that their agents can then publicize these things in the national press!DOH!  The movie kind of doesn't show this either except in a scene in which the article the noble Joe is writing is shown in backward letters as he's typing it, as if the viewer were sitting behind his computer screen.  Better watch carefully.  The scene lasts about five seconds.So the altruistic Joe publishes his wonderful article refuting the Bush claim that, ""The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa.""  The famous sixteen words.  Joe immediately knows that he is the source of this information despite the fact that he is not British, that Africa consists of a lot of different countries besides Niger, and that ""intelligence"" is a word not normally used to describe himself.  (British Intelligence, by the way, stands by this claim today.)The mean, vicious, terrible, tyrannical, horrible, constitution-shredding, torture-mongering Bush administration decides to get back at him by outing his wife, the secret, 0007 CIA operative.  She was so seeeeeee-cret.  Except, well, she kind of commuted to work every day to Langley, driving her car back and forth, that sort of thing.  Nobody could have possibly known she worked for the CIA.  Unless they followed her there.  She must have taken secret routes.  Oh.  And the movie shows that she came home late.  3:45am.  Great strain on the marriage you see.  The wonderful marriage these wonderful people had was strained by the evil Bush.  And she had nightmares, too.  That's how important she was.So the Bush administration reveals her identity and all hell breaks loose.  Their marriage suffers.  Sean Penn looks anguished.  He wants to strike back.  Valerie wants it all to go away.  They still love each other.  They are really better than the rest of us and way better than the fascist Bushies.When the film ends and as the credits are rolling and as just about everyone is walking out of the theatre or falling asleep, the name ""Dick Armitage"" is mentioned as being ""a"" source of the great Valerie's ""outing.""  Hmm.  Little problem here.  Dick Armitage, according to Robert Novak--the one whose article started all of this in the first place--was, ""the"" source.  The only one.  There was no other.  And despite a years-long special prosecutor investigation into this, no member of the White House was ever convicted or indicted for ""outing"" Valerie Plame.  None.  Except for Scooter Libby who was convicted of perjury after being deposed about twenty times.  Of course.But let's go back to Dick Armitage, the one mentioned in the credits after the movie ended.  Dick Armitage was not a member of the White House.  He was a member of the State House.  He worked for Colin Powell, the Secretary of State.  Let me repeat that, just for fun.  DICK ARMITAGE WAS NOT A MEMBER OF THE WHITE HOUSE.(The whole thing came about in a rather mundane fashion.  Novak asked him, ""Why in the world would the CIA send this jackass to Niger?""  Armitage said, ""Do you know who his wife is?"")So the premise of this film, which is that the White House tried to exact revenge on the dopey Joe Wilson by exposing his wife as a CIA agent, is a lie.  Hopefully, Joe and his svelte, stylish, lovely wife, will disappear from public life forever more, and that this propagandist ""film""--well-made by the slick Limon--will be forever discredited for the dishonest piece of trash that it is.",1,Poppycock,1311292800,"07 22, 2011",2011,5511,"['Nice', 'know', 'are', 'people', 'high', 'places', 'watching', 'out', 'Protecting', 'evil', 'sort', 'thing',

Needless to say, Sean Penn and Naomi Watts are outstanding as Wilson and Plame (and it doesn&#8217;t hurt that they look quite similar to Wilson and Plame.)While political intrigue films generally have a hard time holding my attention, &#8220;Fair Game&#8221; was engrossing from beginning to end, a story of amoral pragmatism met by moral gusto. For me the pivotal moment comes in the kitchen of their family home: Valerie wants Joe to shut up because of the harm it is bringing on their family (remember, this is the same time that the Dixie Chicks were receiving death threats for expressing their frustration with George Bush). But Joe won&#8217;t back down: apparently Joe didn&#8217;t realize that the old adage &#8220;You can&#8217;t fight city hall&#8221; applied to the White House as well. Here&#8217;s how the dialogue unfolds:Valerie: &#8220;You seriously think you can pick a fight with the White House and win?

There is not a person that has not heard of Ms. Plame who was no ordinary ambassador's wife, working professional and a mother, but rather a CIA agent with very good looks.  Her story is unprescedented in a sense that her husband's outspoken nature caused the US high level officials to reveal her identity as a CIA covert agent and directly put in danger not only her family, but also the contacts she groomed in 18 years of her career as a CIA agent.I have not read the book, but I did follow the events regarding this political scandal.  In any case, I enjoyed the portrayal of Joe Wilson a man of strong convictions who is standing his ground and defending his ideals.  It is not often one seems a middle aged man, with family, standing his ground when it comes to his political ideas.  I do not believe that Joe Wilson ever believed that government officials would take their anger and disapproval of his conduct so harshly to destroy both of their careers and almost their marriage.  In a movie,  Penn portrays Wilson as a wise and rational man and I must admit I am less impresed with Plame's character (not Watt's performance though).  I found Plame to be naive and even silly at times and her take that her job ""pays the bills"" did not convince me of undying loyalty to either country, or her family for that matter.  After watching the movie both issues almost seem like a fallback after she lost it all.

Kyle,"[70, 77]","Remember Joe Wilson, the man who called a US President a liar?No, I don't mean the Congressman from South Carolina who shouted out a spontaneous ""You Lie!"" at President Barack Obama during the State of the Union address.  I'm referring to Ambassador Joseph C. Wilson who wrote a New York Times editorial entitled ""What I Didn't Find In Africa"" contradicting President George W. Bush regarding the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.""Fair Game"" relates to the latter Joe Wilson (played by Sean Penn), who served as a diplomat in Africa during the 1990's and was asked to visit Niger prior to the Iraqi war to determine if there was yellowcake uranium there. Ambassador Wilson did not find the uranium on his visit and when the President referred to the uranium being there, he wrote a contradiction.As a result of that contradiction, Wilson's wife CIA agent Valerie Plame (Naomi Watts) was determined to be 'fair game' by the Bush Administration. Her cover was blown and the operations she engaged in were all scrapped, including getting Iraqi nuclear scientists who had been involved in Iraq's nuclear program before it was destroyed during a previous US invasion and their families free from their war-torn country.The film's a tightly paced combination spy thriller and domestic drama.  On one hand, you see the front page news of ""Plamegate"".  Valerie's discredited and her career is dismantled. She goes from being a well-traveled agent with highly critical projects to 'a secretary' or a 'low level flunky' depending on what you read.On the other, you see the Wilson homelife unraveling. The idealistic Joe is counterpointed strongly by his realistic wife as the country turns against them both. They receive countless threats, to the point of Valerie having to remove her children from their home.This investigation resulted in the case, US vs. Libby in which Vice President Dick Cheney's aide Scooter Libby was  tried on five federal felony counts. Libby was convicted on four of those charges, involving false statements, perjury, and obstruction of justice, none of which related directly to the Plame revelation but rather to his failure to cooperate with the subsequent investigation into the revelation. Libby was sentenced to 30 months in prison and a fine of $250,000. President Bush subsequently commuted Libby's sentence.If you're interested in Wilson's memoirs, check out:The Politics of Truth: A Diplomat's Memoir: Inside the Lies that Led to War and Betrayed My Wife's CIA IdentityRebecca Kyle, November 2010",5,Compelling spy thriller and domestic drama,1290384000,"11 22, 2010",2010,2541,"['Remember', 'Joe', 'Wilson', 'man', 'who', 'called', 'US', 'President', 'liar', 'No', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'Congressman', 'South', 'Carolina', 'who', 'shouted', 'out', 'spontaneous', 'Lie', 'President', 'Barack', 'Obama', 'State', 'Union', 'address', ""'m"", 'referring', 'Ambassador', 'Joseph', 'C.', 'Wilson', 'who', 'wrote', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'editorial', 'entitled', 'What', 'Did', ""n't"", 'Find', 'Africa', 'contradicting', 'President', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'regarding', 'existence', 'weapons', 'mass', 'destruction', 'Iraq', 'Fair', 'Game', 'latter', 'Joe', 'Wilson', 'played', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'who', 'served', 'diplomat', 'Africa', '1990', 'was', 'asked', 'visit', 'Niger', 'prior', 'Iraqi', 'war', 'determine', 'was', 'yellowcake', 'uranium', 'there', 'Ambassador', 'Wilson', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'uranium', 'visit', 'when', 'President', 'referred', 'uranium', 'being', 'there', 'wrote', 'contradiction.As', 'result', 'contradiction', 'Wilson', 'wife', 'CIA', 'agent', 'Valerie', 'Plame', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'was', 'determined', 'be', ""'fair"", 'game', 'Bush', 'Administration', 'cover', 'was', 'blown', 'operations', 'engaged', 'were', 'scrapped', 'including', 'getting', 'Iraqi', 'nuclear', 'scientists', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'involved', 'Iraq', 'nuclear', 'program', 'was', 'destroyed', 'previous', 'US', 'invasion', 'families', 'free', 'war-torn', 'country.The', 'film', 'tightly', 'paced', 'combination', 'spy', 'thriller', 'domestic', 'drama', 'one', 'hand', 'see', 'front', 'page', 'news', 'Plamegate', 'Valerie', 'discredited', 'career', 'dismantled', 'being', 'well-traveled', 'agent', 'highly', 'critical', 'projects', ""'"", 'secretary', ""'low"", 'level', 'flunky', 'depending', 'what', 'read.On', 'other', 'see', 'Wilson', 'homelife', 'unraveling', 'idealistic', 'Joe', 'counterpointed', 'strongly', 'realistic', 'wife', 'country', 'receive', 'countless', 'threats', 'point', 'Valerie', 'having', 'remove', 'children', 'home.This', 'investigation', 'resulted', 'case', 'US', 'vs.', 'Libby', 'Vice', 'President', 'Dick', 'Cheney', 'aide', 'Scooter', 'Libby', 'was', 'tried', 'five', 'federal', 'felony', 'counts', 'Libby', 'was', 'convicted', 'four', 'charges', 'involving', 'false', 'statements', 'perjury', 'obstruction', 'justice', 'none', 'related', 'directly', 'Plame', 'revelation', 'rather', 'failure', 'cooperate', 'subsequent', 'investigation', 'revelation', 'Libby', 'was', 'sentenced', '30', 'months', 'prison', 'fine', '250,000', 'President', 'Bush', 'subsequently', 'commuted', 'Libby', 'sentence.If', ""'re"", 'interested', 'Wilson', 'memoirs', 'check', 'Politics', 'Truth', 'Diplomat', 'Memoir', 'Lies', 'Led', 'War', 'Betrayed', 'My', 'Wife', 'CIA', 'IdentityRebecca', 'Kyle', 'November', '2010']",Fair Game

There's no closure for anyone until these question are answered. Ambassador Joe Wilson and Valerie Plame were two people who were deeply affected by the analysis to go to war done by the people in the Cheney administration. In this case, particularly in Joe Wilson's case, things just didn't add up. He KNEW that the information was not only cooked, it was completely fabricated. There's a lot more unsaid in this story, and countless others that occurred during the Cheney years. There's a reason he can't leave the US.I also recommend the Pentagon Papers, a fine movie dealing with the Ellsberg case. In both cases, the government attempted to lie to the American people in order to pursue a certain agenda involving American military involvement overseas.

""Fair Game,"" like ""All the President's Men,"" tells an important true story about how dangerous the clashing between media and government can be and that we should always hold people accountable for their actions, regardless of the positions they hold. ""Fair Game"" is a taunt political thriller that is accurate to the events but also gripping in a cinematic way. The performances from Naomi Watts and Sean Penn are terrific and the film is well written with snappy dialogue. Long story shot, ""Fair Game"" is fine tuned, adult entertainment. The film makes you think, it's relevant, and exciting. It's important for films based on true events, where the outcome is already know, to remain engrossing, and ""Fair Game"" is certainly that.On a side note, one of the biggest mysteries of the 2010 movie year was how completely overlooked Naomi Watt's performances were. She had a trio of tremendous films that were totally ignored.

Bush going to war in Iraq. What's fascinating about this dramatic thriller is that it recalls films like ""All the President's Men"" in terms of its matter-of-fact presentation and the reaction of our government to try and minimize or discredit people doing what they felt was right.The resulting fall out (pun intended) resulted in his wife being exposed as an agent, putting those under her supervision and those she was trying to help as part of her ops at risk all for political gain. The result was that even Wilson himself faced accusations that he was lying for financial gain in the process. The resulting pressures nearly drove them apart destroying their lives all for the sake of saving face.The film directed by Doug Liman (""The Bourne Identity"") and written by Jez and John Henry-Butterworth but based on the book by Plame benefits from strong and authentic feeling performances by Naomi Watts as Plame and Sean Penn as Wilson.The Blu-ray edition of the film features a strong looking, sharp transfer. Colors don't exactly pop but they aren't meant to here--the film is true to the original theatrical presentation in that regard but detail remains razor sharp throughout the presentation of the film. Audio is quite strong although keep in mind this is primarily a dialogue driven drama.Unfortunately the only special feature included on the Blu-ray is a commentary track by Plame and Wilson and while it is a welcome addition, it would have been interesting to have licensed some of the news footage of Plame's actual testimony about the events that transpired. The duo admit that it's a bit weird commenting on a drama based on real life that they lived through (since there will be a certain amount of fictionalized elements to make it work as a film). It might have been better to have both of them discuss the making of the film with director Liman and comment on the process of life vs. film.An engrossing drama, ""Fair Game"" reminds us all that there are real casualities when personal reputations are attacked as part of a political cover up. I imagine that your reaction to the film may be influenced also by your politics as well although given what occurred it shouldn't.

Easley ""Opa""","[5, 6]","Based upon the true story of a CIA agent's encounter with politics, Fair Game is a suspenseful tale about the career of Valerie Plame and her eventual struggle with the US government.  Naomi Watts does an excellent job playing Plame and Sean Penn is outstanding as her husband, diplomat Joe Wilson.The CIA had been watching Iraq for several years.  During the war in Afghanistan, a rumor surfaced suggesting that Iraq was seeking material to make nuclear weapons.  The Vice President sent his chief of Staff to the CIA to learn if Iraq was a threat to peace.Due to the White House request, CIA leaders asked Joe Wilson, a former US Ambassador in Africa, to travel to Africa and use his contacts to discover whether Niger actually supplied Iraq with yellow-cake uranium.  Joe agrees to take an informal trip to Niger, at his own expense, to learn whatever he could.Valerie's husband Joe gets her in trouble.  Ambassador Wilson travels to Africa and finds that the report about Niger selling nuclear material is false.  After the President, in his State of the Union address, contends that Iraq obtained weapons grade uranium from Niger, he writes a newspaper article that challenges the President's word.  The White House reacts by attacking Joe and Valerie, and releasing to the press that Valerie is a CIA agent.  Being exposed, Valerie loses her effectiveness as a agent and is fired from the CIA.  Joe's actions, whether seen as heroic or foolish, hurt his relationship with Valerie and threatened their marriage.The film enhances Plame's professionalism and integrity by picturing her on several overseas missions as an active and effective undercover operative.  She heads a team that engages in serious actions against foreign threats to the USA.  Valerie is loyal and totally professional.  Even when she is exposed, she insists on keeping silent about her activities and government secrets.What really happened to Valerie Plame?  Why did the Vice President's chief of staff  reveal her identity and blow her CIA cover?  What did the CIA really know about Iraq and their weapons program?  Was Joe Wilson's outrage based upon truth or fraud.  This movie presents answers.This is a good movie that does an excellent job of telling the story of Valerie Plame.
