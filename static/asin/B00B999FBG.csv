It is based on the Zombie mythos and the effects it would have on a body farm. For those of you who don't know what a body farm is (and this is where the movie doesn't tell you much), it is a place where corpses are placed in different situations and monitored for decomposition rates in heat, cold, insects, and other situations. The data is used in forensic pathology when the CSI people discover a corpse and try to establish when the person was killed as well as various other information. These gruesome places actually exist and there is a book called the Body Farm, which was established in 1980 by Dr. William Bass, that you can read if you want to know more (its a well written and horrific book).The idea of these poor victims reanimating and causing havoc is a good one and much could be made use of in a original zombie movie, especially if they could somehow retain memories of their murder.

1623430,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00B999FBG,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[9, 10]","The Canadian horror movie ""13 Eerie"" is a bit of a throw back to old school horror films.  It strands an attractive cast in a desolate location with a preposterous premise and then starts to pick them off one at a time.  There are some good effects, some cheesy make-up, and plenty of escalating gore.  In some ways, I want to reward the movie for being exactly what it wants to be.  It doesn't have lofty goals or ambitions.  It just wants to provide some scares and entertainment.  On the other hand, there is no pretext of a story and barely any characterizations.  A contrived set-up leads to a situation that you've seen a hundred times before, and oftentimes better.  I wanted something to really make this stand out from the overcrowded pack!  What ""13 Eerie"" has is a cast of fairly recognizable (and even likable) faces.  This better than average cast includes Katherine Isabelle, Michael Shanks, Brendan Fehr, Brendan Fletcher, Jesse Moss and Nick Moran.  All have scored in other film and TV projects, so I'm not sure why the screenplay spent so little time actually creating people you might want to know and/or care about.  And in the end, the characters became relatively interchangeable and I wasn't invested in the body count or who might or might not survive.The movie has a grisly (although incredibly silly) premise.  Six undergrads in a forensics program are taking a field test to qualify for a position with the FBI.  Their instructor, an appropriately brusque Shanks, sets up three test sites with actual carnage.  Nice.  Of course, due to health concerns, this disgusting exam has to be set up in an abandoned prison where rumors of horrible genetic experiments have set tongues wagging.  Naturally.  Let's just say that something is still around and it's hungry.  Why would someone bring a buffet of young flesh if it wasn't meant to be eaten?  The creatures are genetically altered, I suppose, but also react like typical zombies.  It's not a particularly well thought out (or explained) mythology, you just kind of have to go with it.  The movie takes a while to get going, but about half way through--things really start to escalate.I guess that's my biggest complaint.  Only the adults (represented by the instructor and the caretaker) feel distinct.  If the movie was going to employ a slow build strategy, that's a good time to get the audience to invest in the characters.  When the kids start fighting for their lives, I wanted to feel a part of the action.  I honestly didn't care who lived or died.  The movie does commit to a relentless wackiness that makes the second half much better.  But still, nothing feels unique.  This has a nostalgic quality and an old-fashioned presentation that are pleasing enough.  If you had a chance to see this for free and you're into this genre, I'd say go for it.  But it's a little harder to recommend this as a DVD purchase.  I've watched it once, I probably won't revisit it anytime soon.  About 2 1/2 stars.  I'll round up due to the fact that I genuinely like the actors.

1623436,A3IYSIAKYOMKTO,B00B999FBG,Renter,"[0, 0]","This is a low budget horror, and they spent most of their money on the cast. That doesn't always work out as well as the pundits claim. That said, this is a fantastic cast. Katharine Isabelle, Brendan Fehr and Michael Shanks are the headliners and they're all in fine form, not phoning it in. The supporting cast does a great job too. The script is actually eerie. Forensics students do their practical on an island that was once a penitentiary with a spooky reputation. This practical involves using real cadavers in staged situations. The guy they bring along as a cook/handyman knows the stories about what used to go on when the island was a prison, and he gets more and more spooked while Shanks's professor character gets more and more impatient with him, which is a very effective way of ratcheting up the tension. The vibe is kind of like Mindhunters meets Re-Animator, at least until the zombies start rising. I don't think I'm spoiling it too much by revealing that part, as you can see from the cover that here there be zombies. The cover is also an accurate representation of how well these zombies are made up: not very well. There's one scene where a zombie chomps off a victim's fingers and then... spits them back out. It would have been less obvious how bad the effects were if they were shot at night, but a lot of them were shot in broad daylight. It's stuff like this that mars an otherwise decent low budget zombie flick. Watch this one for the performances, especially if you're a fan of any of these actors, but it's not very scary after the monsters show up.",3,"Great cast, not too bad script, poor special effects",1403395200,"06 22, 2014",2014,1582,"['low', 'budget', 'horror', 'spent', 'most', 'money', 'cast', ""n't"", 'always', 'work', 'out', 'as', 'well', 'pundits', 'claim', 'said', 'fantastic', 'cast', 'Katharine', 'Isabelle', 'Brendan', 'Fehr', 'Michael', 'Shanks', 'are', 'headliners', ""'re"", 'fine', 'form', 'not', 'phoning', 'supporting', 'cast', 'great', 'job', 'too', 'script', 'actually', 'eerie', 'Forensics', 'students', 'do', 'practical', 'island', 'was', 'once', 'penitentiary', 'spooky', 'reputation', 'practical', 'using', 'real', 'cadavers', 'staged', 'situations', 'guy', 'bring', 'along', 'cook/handyman', 'stories', 'what', 'used', 'go', 'when', 'island', 'was', 'prison', 'more', 'more', 'spooked', 'Shanks', 'professor', 'character', 'more', 'more', 'impatient', 'very', 'effective', 'way', 'ratcheting', 'up', 'tension', 'vibe', 'kind', 'Mindhunters', 'meets', 'Re-Animator', 'least', 'zombies', 'start', 'rising', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'m"", 'spoiling', 'too', 'much', 'revealing', 'part', 'can', 'see', 'cover', 'here', 'there', 'be', 'zombies', 'cover', 'also', 'accurate', 'representation', 'how', 'well', 'zombies', 'are', 'made', 'up', 'not', 'very', 'well', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'zombie', 'victim', 'fingers', 'then', 'back', 'out', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'less', 'obvious', 'how', 'bad', 'effects', 'were', 'were', 'shot', 'night', 'lot', 'were', 'shot', 'broad', 'daylight', 'stuff', 'otherwise', 'decent', 'low', 'budget', 'zombie', 'flick', 'Watch', 'one', 'performances', 'especially', ""'re"", 'fan', 'actors', 'not', 'very', 'scary', 'monsters', 'show', 'up']",13 Eerie
