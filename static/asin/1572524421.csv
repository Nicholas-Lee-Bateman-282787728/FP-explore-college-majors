The film was made by Carlo Ponti in Italy and the names are not the original Greeks, but their Roman  counterparts. The story is told in flashbacks first Penelope the Queen of Ithaca attempting to hold off her suitors and then from a ship wrecked Ulysses attempting to remember who he is. This works beautifully to keep your interest.Somebody wrote a review stating he will wait for the restored widescreen production before seeing this movie and recommends you do not watch either of these versions.

Here Kirk is playing the Greek general Ulysses who spends twenty years away from the bosom of his family, ten at the Trojan War and ten on an ill-fated voyage back to Ithaca.Now, when I first came across my brothers watching this video, I couldn't believe my eyes that Kirk Douglas and Anthony Quinn were in such a cheap-looking movie! Nobody else is an actor or actress of any standing, and the production values are not up to Hollywood standards. Most distressing of all, everyone's dubbed in, including Kirk!Once I had gotten over all these obstacles, though, I was able to enjoy the movie. Ulysses' adventures are recounted as a flashback as he recuperates from amnesia in a strange kingdom. We see him outwit the Cyclops, go mad from the siren's song, and lose all track of time while being enchanted by Circe. Intersperced with Ulysses' strivings are scenes back at Ithaca, where Penelope has all she can do to hold onto her absent husband's throne from would-be usurpers vying for her hand. A new suitor emerges from the pack, played by Anthony Quinn, and he, like Kirk, plays his role straight despite the film's other limitations. The VERY end, AFTER all the bloodshed in the banquet hall, seems to end abruptly with Kirk and Penelope talking very fast off screen about how they have to make up for lost time. That looks a little, &quot;We have to give the cameras back, so let's end it now.&quot;Still in all, &quot;Ulysses&quot; will entertain you if you let it; it did wonders for me, my brothers, and a two-year-old who wandered into the room and found the Cyclops really exciting.",4,Kirk Has a Hard Time Getting Home...,1003104000,"10 15, 2001",2001,1627,"['putting', 'mildly', 'Here', 'Kirk', 'playing', 'Greek', 'general', 'Ulysses', 'who', 'twenty', 'years', 'away', 'bosom', 'family', 'ten', 'Trojan', 'War', 'ten', 'ill-fated', 'voyage', 'back', 'Ithaca.Now', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'brothers', 'watching', 'video', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'eyes', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'were', 'such', 'cheap-looking', 'movie', 'Nobody', 'else', 'actor', 'actress', 'standing', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'not', 'Hollywood', 'standards', 'Most', 'distressing', 'everyone', 'dubbed', 'including', 'Kirk', 'Once', 'had', 'gotten', 'obstacles', 'was', 'able', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'Ulysses', 'adventures', 'are', 'recounted', 'flashback', 'amnesia', 'strange', 'kingdom', 'see', 'outwit', 'Cyclops', 'go', 'mad', 'siren', 'song', 'lose', 'track', 'time', 'being', 'enchanted', 'Circe', 'Intersperced', 'Ulysses', 'strivings', 'are', 'scenes', 'back', 'Ithaca', 'where', 'Penelope', 'can', 'do', 'hold', 'absent', 'husband', 'throne', 'would-be', 'usurpers', 'vying', 'hand', 'new', 'suitor', 'pack', 'played', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'Kirk', 'role', 'straight', 'film', 'other', 'limitations', 'VERY', 'end', 'AFTER', 'bloodshed', 'banquet', 'hall', 'end', 'abruptly', 'Kirk', 'Penelope', 'talking', 'very', 'fast', 'screen', 'how', 'have', 'make', 'up', 'lost', 'time', 'little', 'quot', 'have', 'give', 'cameras', 'back', 'let', 'end', 'now.', 'quot', 'Still', 'quot', 'Ulysses', 'quot', 'will', 'entertain', 'let', 'did', 'wonders', 'brothers', 'two-year-old', 'who', 'wandered', 'room', 'found', 'Cyclops', 'really', 'exciting']",Ulysses VHS

Theres one part of the film where Circe offers Him immortal life an be a God , but Kirk explains what makes life so valuable , the small things that us Humans who We are . that scene was stoled an put in the new 'Clash of the Titans "" , and the end where Ulysses comes to clear His home of Bums , He even tries to save one , but the guy dissed Him an so was His fate .
