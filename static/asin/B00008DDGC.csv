Content-wise, this is the best DVD series I have found.  It doesn't have time-traveling children as one series does and the story is closely in line with the Bible.  It begins with a several minute opening from Charlton Heston, then gets into the story.Unfortunately, it is a little too advanced for a 2.5 year old.  I would definitely recommend it though for an older child because of the amount of talking and slower pace of the story line.",5,Great Movie...

738191,A1C6YIPDQ96RHV,B00008DDGC,James D. Madden,"[52, 53]","This DVD production of the story of Jesus has accomplished exactly what I had hoped for my 3yr old son: an interest in learning about the Lord, His involvement in the lives of those who trust Him, and His love and miracles.  My son often recites (in surprising detail) various scenes from the tale.  One of my fellow brothers in Christ calls my son ""The Little Preacher"" because my son enjoys capturing the attention of those around him so he can retell the story of Jesus.  I understand some reviewing this telling of the story may prefer stricter adherence to various nuances and literary exactness from Scripture - I can appreciate that as I am a literal believer of Scripture.  There is never a perfect retelling of any Biblical story that will appeal to everyone's preference.  As already mentioned, this achieved what I had hoped for my son: help him develop an interest in learning about the Lord, begin building a faith in the Lord, and recognizing a need for relationship with Jesus in his own life.",5,Inspiring Interest in  Future Believers,1191542400,"10 5, 2007",2007,1008,"['DVD', 'production', 'story', 'Jesus', 'accomplished', 'exactly', 'what', 'had', 'hoped', '3yr', 'old', 'son', 'interest', 'learning', 'Lord', 'involvement', 'lives', 'who', 'trust', 'Him', 'love', 'miracles', 'son', 'often', 'surprising', 'detail', 'various', 'scenes', 'tale', 'One', 'fellow', 'brothers', 'Christ', 'calls', 'son', 'Little', 'Preacher', 'son', 'capturing', 'attention', 'so', 'can', 'retell', 'story', 'Jesus', 'understand', 'reviewing', 'telling', 'story', 'may', 'prefer', 'stricter', 'adherence', 'various', 'nuances', 'literary', 'exactness', 'Scripture', 'can', 'appreciate', 'am', 'literal', 'believer', 'Scripture', 'never', 'perfect', 'retelling', 'Biblical', 'story', 'will', 'appeal', 'everyone', 'preference', 'already', 'mentioned', 'achieved', 'what', 'had', 'hoped', 'son', 'help', 'develop', 'interest', 'learning', 'Lord', 'begin', 'building', 'faith', 'Lord', 'recognizing', 'need', 'relationship', 'Jesus', 'own', 'life']",Greatest Heroes and Legends of the Bible - The Miracles of Jesus
