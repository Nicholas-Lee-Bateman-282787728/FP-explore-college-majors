1551077,A2582KMXLK2P06,B008DL4KZY,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","This is a really strange movie about a couple high school students that get this idea to steal drugs, put them in brownies, bring them to school and get everyone (and I mean *everyone*) super high.  While having this as the theme for an entire movie is sort of funny and there's a few classic parts (involving teachers humiliating themselves in particular) the jumbled pacing and the many almost plotless segments really drag (hehe) this one down.For example, the entire first 25 minutes are pointless and don't include a storyline of any sorts, so we encounter a big problem there.  Big enough you might be tempted to stop watching the movie altogether.  The movie is supposed to be about one of the students concerned that his drug-taking habits will get him expelled and unable to get into college when a drug testing policy goes into effect, and you just have to wait a while for this aspect of the storyline to develop.Really hilarious that Adrien Brody -the same man who plays a well-respected high school teacher in the film Detachment released one year after this film- would play a junkie searching for the kids who stole his marijuana, haha.  Also hilarious how everyone in the school just suddenly decides that they have a huge craving for a brownie!The truth is, I don't know how accurate this movie captures the effects of drug use since I've never done any myself (seriously never, not even once for the sake of experimenting- I must have been an uncool goody two shoes!)  If it's portrayed in a completely inaccurate way then the film fails.  However if it *is* accurate, well, this movie might become a 4-star film one day.  Still, the lack of a really understandable plot hurts this one a tad.  I recommend a viewing, but just barely.",3,and you think YOUR high school memories are foggy,1361232000,"02 19, 2013",2013,1751,"['really', 'strange', 'movie', 'couple', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'get', 'idea', 'steal', 'drugs', 'put', 'brownies', 'bring', 'school', 'get', 'everyone', 'mean', '*everyone*', 'super', 'high', 'having', 'theme', 'entire', 'movie', 'sort', 'funny', 'few', 'classic', 'parts', 'involving', 'teachers', 'humiliating', 'particular', 'jumbled', 'pacing', 'many', 'almost', 'plotless', 'segments', 'really', 'drag', 'hehe', 'one', 'down.For', 'example', 'entire', 'first', '25', 'minutes', 'are', 'pointless', 'do', ""n't"", 'include', 'storyline', 'sorts', 'encounter', 'big', 'problem', 'there', 'Big', 'might', 'be', 'tempted', 'stop', 'watching', 'movie', 'altogether', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'one', 'students', 'concerned', 'drug-taking', 'habits', 'will', 'get', 'expelled', 'unable', 'get', 'college', 'when', 'drug', 'testing', 'policy', 'effect', 'just', 'have', 'wait', 'while', 'aspect', 'storyline', 'develop.Really', 'hilarious', 'Adrien', 'Brody', '-the', 'same', 'man', 'who', 'well-respected', 'high', 'school', 'teacher', 'film', 'Detachment', 'released', 'one', 'year', 'film-', 'would', 'play', 'junkie', 'searching', 'kids', 'who', 'stole', 'marijuana', 'haha', 'Also', 'hilarious', 'how', 'everyone', 'school', 'just', 'suddenly', 'have', 'huge', 'craving', 'brownie', 'truth', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'accurate', 'movie', 'effects', 'drug', 'use', ""'ve"", 'never', 'done', 'seriously', 'never', 'not', 'even', 'once', 'sake', 'experimenting-', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'uncool', 'goody', 'two', 'shoes', 'portrayed', 'completely', 'inaccurate', 'way', 'then', 'film', 'fails', 'However', 'accurate', 'well', 'movie', 'might', 'become', '4-star', 'film', 'one', 'day', 'Still', 'lack', 'really', 'understandable', 'plot', 'one', 'tad', 'recommend', 'viewing', 'just', 'barely']",High School
1551078,A2XXBZPQT5EXHV,B008DL4KZY,Darren O'Neill,"[3, 3]","I sat down to watch ""High School"" with no preconceived notions about the movie.  All I knew was that Michael Chiklis was in it and that was good enough for me.  I can't say Chiklis stole the show here, but he played a part so different than what he's played recently in Vegas and The Shield that my wife didn't even recognize him.  Chiklis plays a high school principal hell bent on getting drugs out of his school but of course that becomes impossible to do when honors student and soon to be class valedictorian Henry, played by Matt Bush, decided to toke up for the first time the day before a school-wide drug testing program is implemented.Henry and his stoner friend Travis, played by Sean Marquette, decide that if EVERYONE fails the drug test then nobody can really be held accountable.  Sound thinking, right?  Well, in order to get enough drugs to dose the whole student body they have to rip off the local drug dealer ""Psycho Ed,"" played with gusto by Adrien Brody who absolutely steals the show here.  ""Psycho Ed"" is one part Snoop Dogg and one part white suburban lawyer who had a nervous break down.  He somehow comes off as hilarious and terrifying at the same time!There's no doubt that the premise here is over the top, the characters are over the top and the delivery here is over the top.  All of that doesn't take away from the fun of the ride.  There are a ton of ""stoner comedies"" out there but this one really does stand on its own as a movie with a little more substance to it.

The casting is really good, the writing is pretty good, but when it was all put together it seemed like they were making three different films. Brody delivers the psycho character well but he's in the wrong movie. His acting was so good that it seemed like he was helping a friend make a student film. Chiklis is also very funny and he seems to be in the wrong film. There are great cameos from various actors you will recognize, but beyond the simple plotting and overdone stoner jokes overall it falls flat. The 'What? What?' scene is pretty funny... actually it is very funny...

Henry Burke (Bush) has everything going for him. He has a scholarship to MIT and is in line to be his classes valedictorian. After an accident leads to detention he is brought back together with his old friend Travis (Marquette). They decide to take a break that night and unwind with a joint. After the school's representative in the national spelling bee loses it on TV the principal (Chiklis) institutes a mandatory drug test for everyone in the school. Fearing he will lose everything Henry and Travis come up with a plan. I am not really a fan of ""stoner' comedy (I did like the Harold & Kumar movies) but the plot to this and the cast made it seem interesting to me. I was not disappointed. Adrien Brody is very funny as the man they steal from and Colin Hanks is good as a clueless asst. principle but Michael Chiklis steals the movie. Playing a clueless borderline pervert in charge of the school he is perhaps the funniest clueless principal since Ed Rooney. This is a very different style of stoner comedy and it is more like ""Girl Next Door"" then ""Pineapple Express"". This is nothing amazing but I enjoyed it and laughed quite a bit.
