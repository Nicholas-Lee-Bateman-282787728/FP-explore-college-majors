The cast is smart, sexy, sophisticated and most importantly honest! I had my doubts about in the beginning but the story progressed beautifully and the plot thickened each passing minute. The director is hailed as the next Tyler Perry so I think this is the beginning of more to come.",4,"Sultry, Sexy, DRAMA!",1252972800,"09 15, 2009",2009,398,"['fan', 'films', 'such', 'Two', 'Can', 'Play', 'Game', 'Best', 'Man', 'then', 'will', 'certainly', 'movie', 'cast', 'smart', 'sexy', 'sophisticated', 'most', 'importantly', 'honest', 'had', 'doubts', 'beginning', 'story', 'progressed', 'beautifully', 'plot', 'thickened', 'passing', 'minute', 'director', 'hailed', 'next', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'think', 'beginning', 'more', 'come']",Truth Hall

I originally purchased this film for the sole purpose of supporting independent film. I saw the commercial on Logo and was intrigued but didn't actually buy this one until I read a review. The acting, music and over-all production was amazing, not to mention the story kept me on the edge of my seat. In the review I read, I learned that one woman actually put all of this together. She wrote, produced, directed and stars in the film. I wanted to see how someone could possibly pull all of that off and was pleasantly surprised. Although this is an indie film, the quality is great and the movie is extremely well done! All of the cast are attractive- both the female leads and male lead are sexxxy too.

Because I order so much between Amazon products and other website orders, I did not even notice. I did contact the seller a few days ago and received a very mean comment about me having to trace it myself along with a note stating that I was basically not telling the truth and to remove my review from her page because of her perfect rating here on Amazon. But because of her poor customer service skills and handling of the matter and I, never having had this issue before on Amazon,went out and made another purchase at the mall because I really wanted this movie.After watching this movie, I really would not advise buying it. It has a plot however for me, it had so many parts to each female's story that it does not make you want more but more of you just wanting to know when it will end. The build up was one story on top of another and only if you enjoy gossip will you truly enjoy it.
