1039607,A3UA046AA3DXFD,B000LP5CXE,Sid the Elf,"[1, 2]","It is with great regret that Sid must inform the B lovers of a Gary Busey film falling flat on it's face. Honestly it had nothing to do with giant toothed Busey's performance, it was more the lack there of. How is it possible to list Busey as one of the main actors when he barely broke 5 minutes open? Crooked would be an appropriate title for what the film actually does to the mass followers of the mental guru. Outside of the minimal Busey appearance this one really didn't have anything to offer out of a few laughs and absolute confusion. Seeing it was released in 2007 was perplexing due the the fact it looked like a late 90's straight to video. Yeah the type that would have found itself in the ""guaranteed to be here or it's free"" slot late on a Saturday night years ago.The film opens up with extremely horrible dialogue being spouted by Busey giving us a false sense of excitement. The first scene takes place in a sleazy hotel room with cops Fred Williamson and Tom Brady's brother Dom Brady playing high stakes poker with a pot of $27. That's not a joke either...we counted it, it was $27. While playing one of their buddies Tod Packer's brother (worst actor alive) is in the bedroom with a couple hookers. Just after Shaft wins the big poker match and before Packer gets his rocks off a bunch of masked men burst in and gun fire pops off. The crew is run by the ultimate fake piasan with the worst Italian accent on the market. This loser actually turns out to be the films only source of entertainment outside of the few short lived Busey scenes.Crooked moves in such clumsy fashion you'd think you were watching Santa try to scramble away from a sack on the B.B.T.S field back in 95. The selling point to even move forward with this one was the promise of a heavy dose of Busey which failed miserably. After 15 minutes of deliberating between a Joe Estavez or Gary Busey B we couldn't have went in a worse direction. It's o.k though, we'll make it up to Uncle Joe and Busey for the film demolishing what could have been a stellar 5 star can of Manwich. Naturally we couldn't recommend this piece to any viewer out there. We love some of the worst cinema on the planet and could barely stomach this...so yeah you should steer clear of Crooked.",2,If you only deliver 5 total minutes of Busey you're lucky to earn a 2 star rating,1280102400,"07 26, 2010",2010,2259,"['great', 'regret', 'Sid', 'must', 'inform', 'B', 'lovers', 'Gary', 'Busey', 'film', 'falling', 'flat', 'face', 'Honestly', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'giant', 'toothed', 'Busey', 'performance', 'was', 'more', 'lack', 'there', 'How', 'possible', 'list', 'Busey', 'one', 'main', 'actors', 'when', 'barely', 'broke', '5', 'minutes', 'open', 'Crooked', 'would', 'be', 'appropriate', 'title', 'what', 'film', 'actually', 'mass', 'followers', 'mental', 'guru', 'minimal', 'Busey', 'appearance', 'one', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'offer', 'few', 'laughs', 'absolute', 'confusion', 'Seeing', 'was', 'released', '2007', 'was', 'perplexing', 'due', 'fact', 'looked', 'late', '90', 'straight', 'video', 'Yeah', 'type', 'would', 'have', 'found', 'guaranteed', 'be', 'here', 'free', 'slot', 'late', 'Saturday', 'night', 'years', 'ago.The', 'film', 'up', 'extremely', 'horrible', 'dialogue', 'being', 'spouted', 'Busey', 'giving', 'false', 'sense', 'excitement', 'first', 'scene', 'place', 'sleazy', 'hotel', 'room', 'cops', 'Fred', 'Williamson', 'Tom', 'Brady', 'brother', 'Dom', 'Brady', 'playing', 'high', 'stakes', 'poker', 'pot', '27', 'not', 'joke', 'counted', 'was', '27', 'playing', 'one', 'buddies', 'Tod', 'Packer', 'brother', 'worst', 'actor', 'alive', 'bedroom', 'couple', 'hookers', 'Just', 'Shaft', 'big', 'poker', 'match', 'Packer', 'rocks', 'off', 'bunch', 'masked', 'men', 'burst', 'gun', 'fire', 'pops', 'crew', 'run', 'ultimate', 'fake', 'piasan', 'worst', 'Italian', 'accent', 'market', 'actually', 'out', 'be', 'films', 'only', 'source', 'entertainment', 'few', 'short', 'lived', 'Busey', 'scenes.Crooked', 'moves', 'such', 'clumsy', 'fashion', ""'d"", 'think', 'were', 'watching', 'Santa', 'try', 'scramble', 'away', 'sack', 'B.B.T.S', 'field', 'back', '95', 'selling', 'point', 'even', 'move', 'forward', 'one', 'was', 'promise', 'heavy', 'dose', 'Busey', 'failed', 'miserably', '15', 'minutes', 'deliberating', 'Joe', 'Estavez', 'Gary', 'Busey', 'B', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'went', 'worse', 'direction', 'o.k', ""'ll"", 'make', 'up', 'Uncle', 'Joe', 'Busey', 'film', 'demolishing', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'stellar', '5', 'star', 'can', 'Manwich', 'Naturally', 'could', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'piece', 'viewer', 'there', 'love', 'worst', 'cinema', 'planet', 'could', 'barely', 'stomach', 'so', 'should', 'steer', 'clear', 'Crooked']",Crooked

Beware any movie in which Gary Busey utters the following immortal lines while consoling a guy whose father committed suicide: ""Just look at this as an....(forgetting the script)....an.....what's the word?....(someone says it from off camera) an evolution....of your....your....what's the word? (again from off camera)....your destiny.""  I kid you not. Everyone involved in this wretched production must have been over-medicated or delusional, including the poor devils who put up the money to produce it.In conclusion. It is so awful as to be laughable, therefore, if you do rent or buy it, do so for its (unintentional) comedy content, definitely not for its drama.
