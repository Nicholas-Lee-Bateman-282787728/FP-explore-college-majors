He was a moviebuff, and I needed all the help I could get to keep himentertained. This movie got a lot of mileage with him, andI enjoyed it as well.The story begins with one Dr. Katharine Lewis (Kirstie Alley)a dentist's daughter who becomes a dentist when she grows up.Her friend (Melanie Mayron) nags her about how she can't behappy if she's not in a relationship, but Dr. Lewis pays noattention to such talk. Then through an accident, Dr. Lewisfinds herself going into the Next World. Panicked by theprospect that she is actually dead (""I've never been deadbefore!""), she eventually meets the one who will be heroverseer in this transitional world that she learns is Limbo,a rather humorless, pompous officer, Rogers (Lynn Redgrave)who informs her that she must do community service to earnher right to enter Heaven or else she will take an expressride down on the Hellevator -- which the officer greatlyprefers and does not hide the fact. Accidentally, Dr. Lewischooses her duty, which turns out to be the Tooth Fairy. Sheis told she must collect the teeth of the children each nightwhile they sleep but must never interact with any humans orelse she will forfeit her right to Heaven.What Dr. Lewis does not expect is that any child who has notlost all his baby teeth can still see her. When a childwakes up and sees her, she finds herself in a jam. Beforelong, she finds herself being a counselor and confidante tothe children, and the children start yanking their teeth onpurpose just to meet the Tooth Fairy. This news gets back toRogers, who is quick to warn her that it will cost her if shepersists. Of course, Dr. Lewis persists, thinking she cansomehow make a difference -- and ends up meeting a widowerwith a child and falls in love. Eventually, she breaks theultimate rule and lets adults see her. She is taken back toLimbo with the intention of sending her to Hell.She recovers from her accident to learn that she has beengiven another chance. She meets with the widower and child,and sees that Rogers is there to warn her that she is stillbeing watched.The movie is Disney entertainment with tons of clever linesand a happy ending. Kirstie Alley is at her comic best. LynnRedgrave's performance as the dour Rogers is priceless. Thesoundtrack has hits by the Beach Boys that give the film awackiness that works because the film is a comedy-fantasyof an off-beat nature, not a serious film. For a movie thatis uncomplicated fun, this one is a good bet.",4,"Enjoyable, Fun, Funny, and Entertaining",1109289600,"02 25, 2005",2005,2568,"['bought', 'movie', '1998', 'when', 'had', 'returned', 'USAand', 'was', 'single-parenting', 'disabled', 'son', 'was', 'moviebuff', 'needed', 'help', 'could', 'get', 'keep', 'himentertained', 'movie', 'got', 'lot', 'mileage', 'andI', 'enjoyed', 'well.The', 'story', 'one', 'Dr.', 'Katharine', 'Lewis', 'Kirstie', 'Alley', 'dentist', 'daughter', 'who', 'dentist', 'when', 'up.Her', 'friend', 'Melanie', 'Mayron', 'how', 'ca', ""n't"", 'behappy', 'not', 'relationship', 'Dr.', 'Lewis', 'noattention', 'such', 'talk', 'Then', 'accident', 'Dr.', 'Lewisfinds', 'going', 'Next', 'World', 'Panicked', 'theprospect', 'actually', 'dead', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'deadbefore', 'eventually', 'one', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'heroverseer', 'transitional', 'world', 'Limbo', 'rather', 'humorless', 'pompous', 'officer', 'Rogers', 'Lynn', 'Redgrave', 'who', 'must', 'do', 'community', 'service', 'earnher', 'right', 'enter', 'Heaven', 'else', 'will', 'take', 'expressride', 'down', 'Hellevator', 'officer', 'greatlyprefers', 'not', 'hide', 'fact', 'Accidentally', 'Dr.', 'Lewischooses', 'duty', 'out', 'be', 'Tooth', 'Fairy', 'Sheis', 'told', 'must', 'collect', 'teeth', 'children', 'sleep', 'must', 'never', 'interact', 'humans', 'orelse', 'will', 'forfeit', 'right', 'Heaven.What', 'Dr.', 'Lewis', 'not', 'expect', 'child', 'who', 'notlost', 'baby', 'teeth', 'can', 'still', 'see', 'When', 'up', 'jam', 'Beforelong', 'being', 'counselor', 'confidante', 'tothe', 'children', 'children', 'start', 'yanking', 'teeth', 'onpurpose', 'just', 'meet', 'Tooth', 'Fairy', 'news', 'back', 'toRogers', 'who', 'quick', 'warn', 'will', 'cost', 'shepersists', 'course', 'Dr.', 'Lewis', 'persists', 'thinking', 'cansomehow', 'make', 'difference', 'up', 'meeting', 'widowerwith', 'child', 'love', 'Eventually', 'theultimate', 'rule', 'adults', 'see', 'taken', 'back', 'toLimbo', 'intention', 'sending', 'Hell.She', 'recovers', 'accident', 'learn', 'beengiven', 'chance', 'widower', 'child', 'Rogers', 'there', 'warn', 'stillbeing', 'watched.The', 'movie', 'Disney', 'entertainment', 'tons', 'clever', 'linesand', 'happy', 'ending', 'Kirstie', 'Alley', 'comic', 'best', 'LynnRedgrave', 'performance', 'dour', 'Rogers', 'priceless', 'Thesoundtrack', 'hits', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'give', 'film', 'awackiness', 'film', 'comedy-fantasyof', 'off-beat', 'nature', 'not', 'serious', 'film', 'movie', 'thatis', 'uncomplicated', 'fun', 'one', 'good', 'bet']",N/A

Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[3, 3]","Dr. Katherine Lewis (Kirstie Alley, ""Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan,"" ""Look Who's Talking"") is a dentist focused on her work.  Katherine skates through life without commitment or care, though her life is boring.Katherine meets with a bizarre accident and finds herself in the afterlife.  Katherine is not in heaven or hell, but she is in limbo.  Limbo looks a lot like a cluster of Airstream trailers and miscellaneous artifacts, including a set of airline stairs (Stairway to Heaven the sign says) and a hellavator; no secret where that device goes.  Katherine learns that she has not behaved in a manner that would qualify her for either heaven or hell, and she has to do a kind of community service until a mysterious council decides her fate.  Katherine is having issues believing where she is, so she chooses being the Tooth Fairy without thinking about her decision.Katherine soon discovers that being the tooth fairy has its ups and downs, and she discovers that she is unable to avoid breaking the rules.  The most important rule is to never talk to mortals.  Katherine becomes involved in the lives of the children she meets and tries to help them with their problems.  Of course, life is rarely smooth when an otherworldly being gets involved in the lives of mortals.The movie has its holes, which I initially found a little annoying.  The biggest hole is why Dr. Lewis ended up in limbo.  Dr. Lewis had a great relationship with her father, whom she dearly loved, and she was clearly not an evil person, and yet she ended up with an indeterminate future.  Of course, you could not have the protagonist be really evil, but I struggled with the glossed over version of why Dr. Lewis did not move immediately on to heaven.  I also found Kirstie flopping around to show she was flying to be filler material.  She was cute doing her flying act at first, but then it got boring.On the other hand, this movie was cute, funny and warm.  I found that I enjoyed a lot of this movie and laughed in quite a few places.  I loved limbo.  The surreal nature of limbo almost seemed like something out of ""The Twilight Zone.""  The message of love and caring in the movie was positive and was delivered in a clever and subtle way.  I also wish I was still young enough to believe in the Tooth Fairy, though she gave out quarters in my youth rather than silver dollars.""Toothless"" is a light family comedy that will appeal to young and old alike.

She is assigned to the task of being the tooth fairy by her boss in limbo Rogers, played by Lynn Redgrave) and continues to be a fairly miserable wretch until she finds herself involved in the life of a boy who lost his mother.  Well of course this is against the rules and she runs up against Rogers who wants to send her to Hell as punishment.  Of course this experience changes katherine and gives her a new outlook on life and love and rather than going to hell, she eventually is given a second chance at life and everything ends happily ever after as she meets the widowed father of the boy.It's all pretty hokey and fairly typical of Disney's but it's a pretty good moral message about not letting life pass you by and trying to be a good, loving person.
