Its hard to express exactly what that means, these types of movies are heavy on long, slow plot development and very light on making the climactic horror scenes believable and worthwhile.  No different here. The story development is generally entertaining, but it is slow and drawn out. However, the scenes that should be scary are very amateurish. The way these scenes are pulled off leave a lot to be desired; the camera work and editing are weak, which is disappointing given that the buildup to the scary scenes is actually pretty good.

994508,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000FS2W1W,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[6, 7]","Early on in ""Hatchet Job: The Making of The Tooth Fairy"" featurette on this DVD the actress who plays the titular character in human form comments that this movie is not for little kids.  I mention this because at one point in this direct to video 2006 horror film I was actually thinking that the best explanation for what was happening was that this was indeed a horror movie made for little kids.  But that was before the combination decapitation (male) and topless (female) scene, which made it clear that they really were not making ""Baby's First Horror Film,"" even if the ending is as family oriented as any horror film I have ever seen.We begin back in 1949 in Northern California when Elizabeth Craven (Karin Konoval), a disfigured witch, developed the nasty habit of killing young children after they had lost their last baby tooth.  Then we jump to the present, where young Pamela (Nicole Munoz) and her mother Darcy Wagner (Chandra West) are spending the weekend at the newly opened bed & breakfast of Peter Campbell (Lochlyn Munro).  Of course the B&B; used to be Elizabeth Craven's creepy old house and guess what happens to Pamela when she falls down and bangs her face?  You get the general idea, which is really all you are going to get because it was never clear to me why killing kids after taking their last baby teeth was so important to the old witch.  Pamela makes friends with Emma (Jianna Ballard), who is obviously a ghost.  This matters because since Pamela is the only real kid around the Tooth Fairy is going to have to start taking out the adults at the B&B; (which includes a brief appearance by P.J. Soles from ""Halloween"").  When the Tooth Fairy kills her first victim I did not understand why she was doing it, but then I realized the motivation was essentially the same for the killing as it was for the choice of the method, a woodchipper: because it was there.While I did not know anything about ""The Tooth Fairy"" when I put in the DVD to watch, my expectation was that it would not be like ""Silent Night Deadly Night,"" where a maniac pretends to be a fictional character beloved by children.  Indeed, this is more of a supernatural tale that essentially reveals the twisted truth about the kindly tooth fairy who gives kids money for their baby teeth.  In folklore the Tooth Fairy is traced back to European stories of elves and brownies who would do helpful tasks or trade treasures for items humans considered useless.  But there are also superstitions about how discarded body parts such as teeth or hair could be used for black magic, and this is the approach taken in ""The Tooth Fairy"" (I have to admit I was hoping for more of an evil elf, like when Anya reveals the myth about Santa Claus being a myth on ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"").  However, while that was the approach and while there are the ghosts of dead children running around to lend pathos of the proceedings, in the end ""The Tooth Fairy"" is a basic splatter flick with an old fashioned hatchet as the weapon of choice.I just did not connect with this hybrid supernatural slasher flick with the little girl as the heroine, even though individually those elements are okay (I was less impressed by Chuck and Henry, the ""Deliverance""-type tag-team at the local gas station).  You know, if ""The Tooth Fairy"" had come out in the heyday of the slasher film would have seemed a lot better than it does against the current crop of gore fests, so you will either tolerate it or hate it.  In addition to the aforementioned featurette in terms of extras on the DVD there is another promotional quickie and then ""Loose Tooth,"" the audio commentary with director Chuck Bowman, producer Stephen J. Cannell, and actor Jessie Hutch.  Note: ""The Tooth Fairy"" is not to be confused with ""Tooth Fairy,"" a 2004 Amazon Theater short with Chris Noth that featured Jeff Bezos as a security guard.Final Note: This was the movie where I first looked at the Plot Keywords for the film at the International Movie Data Base.  The top ten keywords for this movie were: (1) woodchipper, (2) topless, (3) mulching a person, (4) tooth fairy, (5) tooth extraction, (6), slasher, (7) redneck, (8) nail gun, (9) haunted house, and (10) gore.  I wanted to make a point about the relative inaccuracy of this particular list (the hatchet is way more prominent than the woodchipper even if not as memorable and the topless scene is done to set up a joke and not to provide titillation), but I quickly became distracted by the fact that you can click on a keyword and actually come up with the top movies on the IMDB for each category.  ""The Tooth Fairy"" comes in 16th of 17 films featuring ""tooth extraction"" (""Schindler's List"" and ""Finding Nemo"" are one and two because the movies are organized by their IMDB ratings), but 7th of 10 films on the ""woodchipper"" list (""Fargo"" is only #3, although ""The Tooth Fairy"" did finish ahead of ""Woodchipper Massacre"").  This particular feature is going to be a constant source of amusement for me for some time to come.",3,Rethinking the whole put the baby tooth under the pillow tradition,1177804800,"04 29,

This is a movie about a pair of recovering addicts now faced with the addiction of blood as new vampires and their struggle to both beat their fixation and regain their humanity and morality. It's not a bad story; just executed badly. The script isn't too bad, although amateurish, and the actors do a good job for what they're given. The only real likable character here is the sympathetic Lisa, played by Clare Kramer. Everyone else is forgettable and not fleshed out very much. I would say the biggest problem with this movie is the directing. Terrible, horrible directing. You wouldn't notice it until you see it done badly. The whole pacing of the movie is rushed and off-kilter, and it feels like they're always strapped for time, not ever letting emotional or dramatic scenes sink in with the audience. The effects and props are also horrible in this movie, with blood being some kind of strawberry soda, apparently. Even grape juice would be a cheaper, better-looking alternative to the oragne-pinkish water they use in this as blood. The oddest thing about the movie is, although clearly vampires, they never once call them ""vampire"" by name in the movie, they don't have fangs, and for the most part, are as strong and agile as regular humans. While clearly done intentionally, it just makes them seem more like crazed cannibals than actual vampires. Other than the fact that nobody fights back in the movie, they aren't intimidating, at all.

I like Clare Kramer, and true to form, was not disapointed as she again gives a good performance.  The film however is sex and gore and gore and sex.  Yes I know it's rated 'R' and what was I suppose to expect?  Okay, I can live with the topless pair of vampire girls who garble out some kind of speech as they run around seemingly aimlessly just causing mayhem and the gore, though excessive really didn't seem out of place considering the setting.  Within all this depravity enters Lisa (Clare Kramer) who becomes the vampire with the heart of gold.  Even though it's not beating, it's still a heart of gold.  The depiction of vampirism as a drug type addiction was pretty cool and the spectacle of a couple vampires trying to kick the habit was my second favorite part of the film.  My favorite part was the ending.  After all the sex, after all the gore and the chase and the slaughter, this film ends with a tender finale that renews one's faith in the goodness of mankind.

994523,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B000FS2W1W,Tim Janson,"[0, 0]","I have a bit of a hard time classifying The Thirst.  It's a vampire movie and it's exceptionally gore-filled, but I have a hard time calling it a horror film because it's not scary. I know...a lot of horror films are not scary, or some are scary for the wrong reasons (House of the Dead, anyone?). But it's really more that it doesn't try to be scary. What it does try is to be a very stylish vampire film (even with the buckets of blood) and succeeds to a degree but is guilty of trying too hard.Clare Kramer is an interesting actress. I've seen her in three different roles, first as the God, Glory, in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, then in Gravedancers, one of the After Dark Horrorfest films, and now in this film. I didn't recognize her in either of these two films initially until I had to check to see which part she was playing. To me that's a real tribute to her as an actress and her ability to blend in to any role. She simply did not look like ""Glory"" in either of these two films.In The Thirst she is Lisa, a drug-addicted stripper who is dying of cancer, a fact she has carefully hidden from her boyfriend, Maxx (Matt Keesler). While dying in the hospital Lisa is visited by a woman who poses as a therapist but in reality is a vampire. Lisa commits suicide but she's already been bitten Sasha and returns to life and is welcomed into Sasha's clan of vamps that includes the leader Darius, a Brit named the Duke of Earl, Lenny, and two rather bizarre women who chatter in an unknown language known just as the sisters.When Maxx discovers that Lisa is still alive he tries to rescue her from the clan but is captured and given the choice of being killed or joining the family. He chooses the latter and soon is joining them on their depraved blood fests as they descend upon various Goth and strip clubs, slaughtering everyone in a literal deluge of blood. Before long, Maxx and Lisa have second thoughts about their new family and know they need to escape. But Darius and Sasha are not going to let them walk away...The Thirst is one gory film! The victims of the vampires don't just get a couple of fang marks in their necks, they get their throats ripped out, sending blood gushing out like a ruptured water pump. Entrails are torn out and snacked and on unfortunate stripper has the back of her head torn like a Christmas present. This leaves our vampires covered in red from head-to-toe.The Thirst goes for a stylish look which detracts from the horror. When the vampires are attacking, the film speeds up to a frenetic, strobe-like pace, and jumps from character to character. Combine that with a techno industrial soundtrack, and it's all a bit disorienting. One of the best scenes is when Maxx and Lisa try to eat a couple of cats and end up with what amounts to a bad acid trip. Kramer and Keesler are able to just go wildly over the top and it's quite amusing.While the actors may not be household names they are all screen veterans. Adam Baldwin plays Lenny, a backwoods, hillbilly vampire, in a rather wide departure from his usual prim and proper roles as a military officer or government agent. Another Buffy alum making an appearance in The Thirst is Tom Lenk who plays Kronos, an androgynous regular at a Goth club. Also look for Ellie Cornell as Nurse Linda. Cornell is best remembered for her roles in Halloween 4 & 5.Not a great film but not horrible either. It's certainly different and has abover average performances from the entire cast. The DVD does come with a very wide range of extras including a making of documentary, deleted scenes, Director Commentary, photo gallery, and a ""Favorite Vampire Movie"" featurette.REVIEWED BY TIM JANSON",3,TRIES TOO HARD TO BE STYLISH BUT NOT BAD,1194566400,"11 9, 2007",2007,3672,"['have', 'bit', 'hard', 'time', 'classifying', 'Thirst', 'vampire', 'movie', 'exceptionally', 'gore-filled', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'calling', 'horror', 'film', 'not', 'scary', 'know', 'lot', 'horror', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'scary', 'are', 'scary', 'wrong', 'reasons', 'House', 'Dead', 'anyone', 'really', 'more', ""n't"", 'try', 'be', 'scary', 'What', 'try', 'be', 'very', 'stylish', 'vampire', 'film', 'even', 'buckets', 'blood', 'degree', 'guilty', 'trying', 'too', 'hard.Clare', 'Kramer', 'interesting', 'actress', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'three', 'different', 'roles', 'first', 'God', 'Glory', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'then', 'Gravedancers', 'one', 'Dark', 'Horrorfest', 'films', 'now', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'two', 'films', 'initially', 'had', 'check', 'see', 'part', 'was', 'playing', 'real', 'tribute', 'actress', 'ability', 'blend', 'role', 'simply', 'did', 'not', 'look', 'Glory', 'two', 'films.In', 'Thirst', 'Lisa', 'drug-addicted', 'stripper', 'who', 'dying', 'cancer', 'fact', 'carefully', 'hidden', 'boyfriend', 'Maxx', 'Matt', 'Keesler', 'dying', 'hospital', 'Lisa', 'visited', 'woman', 'who', 'therapist', 'reality', 'vampire', 'Lisa', 'suicide', 'already', 'been', 'bitten', 'Sasha', 'returns', 'life', 'welcomed', 'Sasha', 'clan', 'vamps', 'leader', 'Darius', 'Brit', 'named', 'Duke', 'Earl', 'Lenny', 'two', 'rather', 'bizarre', 'women', 'who', 'chatter', 'unknown', 'language', 'known', 'just', 'sisters.When', 'Maxx', 'Lisa', 'still', 'alive', 'rescue', 'clan', 'captured', 'given', 'choice', 'being', 'killed', 'joining', 'family', 'latter', 'soon', 'joining', 'depraved', 'blood', 'fests', 'descend', 'various', 'Goth', 'strip', 'clubs', 'slaughtering', 'everyone', 'literal', 'deluge', 'blood', 'long', 'Maxx', 'Lisa', 'have', 'second', 'thoughts', 'new', 'family', 'know', 'need', 'escape', 'Darius', 'Sasha', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'let', 'walk', 'away', 'Thirst', 'one', 'gory', 'film', 'victims', 'vampires', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'get', 'couple', 'fang', 'marks', 'necks', 'get', 'throats', 'ripped', 'out', 'sending', 'blood', 'gushing', 'out', 'ruptured', 'water', 'pump', 'Entrails', 'are', 'torn', 'out', 'snacked', 'unfortunate', 'stripper', 'back', 'head', 'torn', 'Christmas', 'present', 'vampires', 'covered', 'red', 'head-to-toe.The', 'Thirst', 'stylish', 'look', 'horror', 'When', 'vampires', 'are', 'attacking', 'film', 'up', 'frenetic', 'strobe-like', 'pace', 'jumps', 'character', 'character', 'Combine', 'techno', 'industrial', 'soundtrack', 'bit', 'disorienting', 'One', 'best', 'scenes', 'when', 'Maxx', 'Lisa', 'try', 'eat', 'couple', 'cats', 'end', 'up', 'what', 'amounts', 'bad', 'acid', 'trip', 'Kramer', 'Keesler', 'are', 'able', 'just', 'go', 'wildly', 'top', 'quite', 'amusing.While', 'actors', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'household', 'are', 'screen', 'veterans', 'Adam', 'Baldwin', 'Lenny', 'backwoods', 'hillbilly', 'vampire', 'rather', 'wide', 'departure', 'usual', 'prim', 'proper', 'roles', 'military', 'officer', 'government', 'agent', 'Buffy', 'alum', 'making', 'appearance', 'Thirst', 'Tom', 'Lenk', 'who', 'Kronos', 'androgynous', 'regular', 'Goth', 'club', 'Also', 'look', 'Ellie', 'Cornell', 'Nurse', 'Linda', 'Cornell', 'best', 'remembered', 'roles', 'Halloween', '4', '5.Not', 'great', 'film', 'not', 'horrible', 'either', 'certainly', 'different', 'abover', 'average', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'DVD', 'come', 'very', 'wide', 'range', 'extras', 'including', 'making', 'documentary', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Director', 'Commentary', 'photo', 'gallery', 'Favorite', 'Vampire', 'Movie', 'featurette.REVIEWED', 'BY', 'TIM', 'JANSON']","Tooth Fairy, The abe"
994524,A3AAK33K3BUUTM,B000FS2W1W,trashcanman,"[1, 1]","""The Thirst"" may not be the worst vampire film I've ever seen, but it's far from the best, even by B-movie standards.  But if you're a vampire-philic gorehound looking for 90 minutes to kill, you may want to give this a whirl.  It stars ""Buffy"" alum Clare Kramer (murderous blonde goddess fromseason 5ring a bell?) with strong support from petite sexpot Charlotte Ayana (most notably seen playing a vamp herself inThe Insatiable) andFirefly's Adam Baldwin.  Geek factor: engaged.  The story is stupid and blatantly rip off superior films likeNear Darkand even points out some of the annoying similarities toSid & Nancyitself.Yes, this is a story of vampire junkies.  Blood junkies.  In love.  A more obnoxiously and clumsily executed allegory I could not imagine.  But for we real life blood junkies, this flick delivers big time.  This may well be the single bloodiest vampire movie I've ever seen.  I'm not sure if that deserves praise when every little nick on the arm creates a torrent of red fluid so profuse that dubbing it ""arterial spray"" just doesn't cut it.  It's almost slapstick.  The characters are almost across-the-board lame, the protagonists unlikeable, the ""detox"" scene is embarrassing, and I seriously wanted to harm the actresses paying a pair of grimy feral she-vamps who spend every on-camera second making the most obnoxious noises you can imagine and generally behaving like twin spastics on meth (in fact, that's the exact direction I imagine the director giving them on the set) and yet I enjoyed this movie for several reasons.  Reasons one and two: nudity and gore, the saviors of many a half-aSzed vampire flick.  Reason three: I actually loved the scene where the protagonist attempts to ""turn"" his friend and fails.  I've never seen it happen before, it adds a degree of reality, and it's just a great eye-opening scene for both audience and character that worked.  And reason four: the music was pretty interesting and varied.If I were a bull, I would have demolished my television because all I saw was red.  And I wasn't angry.  Lots of blood and quality over-the-top gore: check.  Exposed breasts: double check (I made a funny!).  Vampire family that wants to be from ""Near Dark"" andTexas Chainsaw Massacre(dinner scene and everything) at the same time: check.  Burning bodies aplenty: check.  Goth dance club where the undead lie in wait to have blood orgy with unsuspecting sado-masochists: check.Draculareference: check.  This is exactly what you'd expect from a movie titled ""the Thirst"".  It shouldn't be at the top of your must-see list, but if you're in the mood then this will scratch your B-movie itch.
