None were very good at describing the series they advertised, others were useless, complete wastes of space. One was for a live action movie, not something I consider useful on an anime series preview list.Disc 3: Clean open/close,Disc 4: Also Available previews.More drama and some situational comedy woven into the storyline than the usual one-liner style comedy. The same with the romantic aspect, it's not so much about love as need. The style changes from a conspiracy/paranoia story about a NEET (shut-in) to struggling game creators (""girl games"") type then on to a love story (that turns out is and isn't). This is a bit confusing at first, but pulls the storyline together well while bringing forward enough info and background to tie it all together. Somewhat unique in dealing with issues of NEETs/Hikikomori, but overall I'd say it's pretty mediocre overall.This is one of those animes with a brief bit after the ending credits of the last episode but nothing major. Sit through the end credits once and you'll have seen it and not need to do so again.I don't think I'd have bothered buying this if I had seen it previously, so take that for what it's worth.

Queue the cute but absent minded girl who takes it upon herself to 'change' the main character for the better.  Add a hilarious neighbor and hilarity ensues.  There are a lot of Otaku references, so this is probably not a good intro to anime or Japanese culture, but those familiar with other anime series and modern Japanese society will surely enjoy it.Oh and one last thing:  Puru puru pururin!!!!!!!!!Watch the series and you'll get it!------------------------------------------Update:  So I watched the entirety and I must say that this series surprised me greatly.  What appears on the surface to be a simple slice of life comedy is actually much more meaningful and deep than the first impression would give.  The series does include a lot of humor and some clever anecdotes on life, and is immensely satisfying for casual viewing but...The series definitely takes a dramatic turn and all of the sudden, real life rears its ugly head.  This series touches on a world wide problem with youth who are unable to adapt to the modern world and hectic pace of life today.  What Italian directors portrayed in the 60s is shown in this series.  Inability to adapt brings out the latent neurosis is some people.  Most of the characters exhibit this to some extent.  Most find ways to adapt, though they aren't completely 'cured', which is all very realistic.  There are references to Freud and Jung throughout, even the 'lessons' by Misaki feature the works of Jung.This is truly a black comedy, rife with angst, pain, suicide, social anxiety, love, questioning existence and god, and finally acceptance.  What I took from this series is that everybody has their share of problems, especially in a world where it is so easy to remove oneself from society, but that there is hope for some happiness.  Truly an existential work and one that is so deeply layered and complex beneath the surface that it is well worth viewing many times over the years.The only con would be the animation is rudimentary in some instances, disappointing since I know Gonzo is capable of perfection (i.e. Last Exile).Please view with Japanese language and English subtitles for the true effect of this series.",5,So Funny and Engaging!!!,1292544000,"12 17, 2010",2010,2447,"['Recommend', '18+', 'viewing', 'due', 'adult', 'themes', 'smoking', 'occasional', 'animated', 'nudity', 'top', 'only', '.The', 'series', 'NEET', 'hikkimori', 'named', 'Sato', 'basically', 'modern', 'day', 'shut-in', 'who', 'TV', 'day', 'never', 'ventures', 'absolutely', 'necessary', 'Queue', 'cute', 'absent', 'minded', 'girl', 'who', ""'change"", 'main', 'character', 'better', 'Add', 'hilarious', 'neighbor', 'hilarity', 'ensues', 'are', 'lot', 'Otaku', 'references', 'probably', 'not', 'good', 'intro', 'anime', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'familiar', 'other', 'anime', 'series', 'modern', 'Japanese', 'society', 'will', 'surely', 'enjoy', 'it.Oh', 'one', 'last', 'thing', 'Puru', 'pururin', 'Watch', 'series', ""'ll"", 'get', 'Update', 'So', 'watched', 'entirety', 'must', 'say', 'series', 'surprised', 'greatly', 'What', 'surface', 'be', 'simple', 'slice', 'life', 'comedy', 'actually', 'much', 'more', 'meaningful', 'deep', 'first', 'impression', 'would', 'give', 'series', 'include', 'lot', 'humor', 'clever', 'life', 'immensely', 'satisfying', 'casual', 'viewing', 'series', 'definitely', 'dramatic', 'turn', 'sudden', 'real', 'life', 'ugly', 'head', 'series', 'world', 'wide', 'problem', 'youth', 'who', 'are', 'unable', 'adapt', 'modern', 'world', 'hectic', 'pace', 'life', 'today', 'What', 'Italian', 'directors', 'portrayed', '60s', 'shown', 'series', 'Inability', 'adapt', 'brings', 'out', 'latent', 'neurosis', 'people', 'Most', 'characters', 'exhibit', 'extent', 'Most', 'find', 'ways', 'adapt', 'are', ""n't"", 'completely', ""'cured"", 'very', 'realistic', 'are', 'references', 'Freud', 'Jung', 'even', ""'lessons"", 'Misaki', 'feature', 'works', 'Jung.This', 'truly', 'black', 'comedy', 'rife', 'angst', 'pain', 'suicide', 'social', 'anxiety', 'love', 'questioning', 'existence', 'god', 'finally', 'acceptance', 'What', 'took', 'series', 'everybody', 'share', 'problems', 'especially', 'world', 'where', 'so', 'easy', 'remove', 'society', 'hope', 'happiness', 'Truly', 'existential', 'work', 'one', 'so', 'deeply', 'layered', 'complex', 'beneath', 'surface', 'well', 'worth', 'viewing', 'many', 'times', 'years.The', 'only', 'con', 'would', 'be', 'animation', 'rudimentary', 'instances', 'disappointing', 'know', 'Gonzo', 'capable', 'perfection', 'i.e', 'Last', 'Exile', '.Please', 'view', 'Japanese', 'language', 'English', 'subtitles', 'true', 'effect', 'series']",Welcome to the NHK: Complete Series

This isn't blood-soaked ninjas driving mechs either.  &#34;Welcome to the NHK&#34; is a unique and hilariously depressing look at a sweeping epidemic of agoraphobic culture that's already here in the states, but is so solidified in Japan that it's coined a culture and an acronym, N.E.E.T. (No Employment, Education or Training).While we have a thousand and one reasons to stay in our apartments and never leave, our main character has agoraphobia and doesn&#8217;t need those internet trinkets to help keep him indoors.  Now he will be introduced.  This show tracks his progress and pitfalls as he discovers all the new reasons to never see sunlight.  Porn, World of Warcraft, Ponzi schemes, suicide cults, video game design, and laughing, purple conspiracies are just a fraction of the gauntlet our hero must face when deciding whether or not it&#8217;s worth opening the door and dealing with anyone.This show also makes sure that any outsider who manages to break into his &#8220;Fortress of Solitude&#8221; (made of empty beer cans), also carries their own realistic baggage packed full of psychological flotsam.NHK&#8217;s narrative can drag at times, but is oddly powerful.  The comedy is nerve racking and the emotions are crushing at times.  This show will blindside you with some heavy concepts and human suffering if you&#8217;re not careful and just expect him to quiver around girls all day.This is a hard show to recommend; 26 EPISODES ABOUT A GUY NEVER LEAVING HIS APARTMENT. Insecure fan boys might not like the mirror it holds up.  Many will find it outright boring.  The conclusion at the end is anything but epic, but instead is highly realistic and sobering.To speak of its production value; the animation is very smooth and well done.  The music is catchy and fits perfectly with the shows tone.  The dialogue is bipolar and shifts quickly between pensive comedic stabs and somberly charming ballads.The fact that its&#8217; on S.A.V.E. makes it a safer purchase.  Take a chance on it, but know what you&#8217;re getting yourself into.  &#8220;Welcome to the NHK&#8221; is hard to market, because it reminds adults of the child trapped inside, and reminds children of the adult waiting inevitably for them in the future.Welcome to a truly admirable slice of life.",5,Unique and not for everyone.

1260236,A2ZT3DIS3GGE25,B002BWD73W,Duncan C. White,"[1, 2]","Interesting anime you get to see through the eyes of the Japanese culture. Its kind of like therapy and cheerleading for the hikikomori or recluse. Though Japanese society of course is portrayed as totally blameless, it is highly taboo in Japan to question the structure of their society, likewise the Japanese family structure is shown as above question and totally blameless. Never mind I'm sure many of the hikikomori were victims of abuse and neglect in the nuclear family. The crushing spiritual weight of the Japanese educational system and career expectations are likewise not give air time. All the reasons for Satou withdrawing totally from society are goofy and simply dont resonate. The anime simply doesnt have the guts to challenge Japanese society on any deep level and kind of feeds into the superstitions and invectives used on hikikomori. They had some silly emotional rejection, they withdrew, society is great and they just need to pull it together and get moving.So really if the anime refuses to deal with these mammoth social problems in Japan I have to question how helpful this anime was really to the hikikomori. Could it really resonate with them? Or does it just make them blame themselves even more for their inability or lack of desire to connect with Japanese culture in the 'normal' way. Perhaps just bringing the issue to light in a way that isnt totally negative is pleasant for the hikikomori, here is hoping so.Taken purely as entertainment its got its moments. Some of the more wacky scenes are quite a bit of fun and some of the scenes work on an emotional level. There are also moments of humor but some of it is heavily ingrained in the Japanese culture of strick social rules so it loses a bit of impact to Westerners. Some of the episodes feel contrived and feel like an American 'after school special', an example of this would be the death pact group. The anime's intentions were good but it just felt heavy.The anime is overall enjoyable and worth watching but it is hit or miss most definitely.

I've searched far and wide for years, but nothing has ever captured my emotions this well. Welcome to the NHK is about a hikikimori (a shut in) who believes his life is surrounded by conspiracy. He has no job, lives off of his parents money, and is afraid to even step outside of his small apartment.When a mysterious girl appears in his life and wants to help him get out of this lifestyle for no apparent reason, his time in limbo ends and he starts a journey of self-discovery. It's a fairly simple plot but it's portrayed so well. Even though I am not necessarily a shut in myself, I can easily relate to the characters as they deal with failures, social anxieties, and the feelings that everyone is looking down on them.There are points when the show has its ups and downs, especially when it comes to the quality of the animation, but I've always found the situations entertaining in a way that makes you want to laugh and cry at the same time. It's a really great balance and something that is sometimes pretty difficult to find in the world of anime.I would recommend this to anyone who has ever felt intense feelings of loneliness or depression.

Jenkins ""AuspexAO""","[1, 1]","I admit I'm a few years late to this particular party, but I definitely feel the need to post a review to give a nod of recognition to this excellent series. Welcome to the NHK is part comedy/part drama. Like all the best comedy it is meaningful, and like the best drama it doesn't take itself too seriously. Sato is a hikikomori: (I hope I spelled that right) basically an unemployed hermit who fears the pressures of the outside world. How Sato reacts to the outside world is a source of most of the humor.First, I'd like to rave a little about the characters. ALL the noteworthy characters in this show have problems of some sort. Sato's problem is the focus of the show and being a rather self-absorbed person his perspective doesn't allow him to learn that much about the people around him. As a viewer we can empathize with Misaki and Yamazaki (God, I hope I'm getting these name's right) his two closest friends. To avoid spoiling too much let's just say that Misaki is a young girl who apparently wants to help Sato overcome his problems for no reason other than kindness and Yamazaki is an Otaku with rage issues.The animation is excellent with a few exceptions. A couple shows look terrible and it makes me wonder if they intentionally designed them that way because it is sooo different than the rest of the show. The music is amazing and really sets the mood of the series. (I especially like ""Dancing Baby Human"" the ending song for the first disk or so)The high point of the show, however, is not so much the things that happen to the characters, (although some rather extreme situations do crop up) but how the characters react to their situations. Sato's first reaction to any situation tends to be addiction and escapism and it's easy to see why. The introspective sessions which follow these boughts of hedonist revelry tend to be brutal and tainted with what can only be called psychosis. Misaki is a puzzle at first, but the seeds of her character are planted from the start. The neighbor and best friend Yamazaki is much more complex than he appears. His abrasive behavior and misogynistic rants are a product of real pain, and the writers do a great job of making his character sympathetic despite his many faults.If you're interested in character studies and psychology (the ""dream analysis"" scene is the funniest thing I have seen in ages) than buy this series immeadiately. Some people will be put off by the numerous reverances to ""deviant"" Japanese culture, but it wouldn't be a very honest show if factors like internet pornography and hentai games didn't enter into it at some point.",5,So good...it must be a CONSPIRACY!,1281571200,"08 12, 2010",2010,2612,"['admit', ""'m"", 'few', 'years', 'late', 'particular', 'party', 'definitely', 'feel', 'need', 'post', 'review', 'give', 'nod', 'recognition', 'excellent', 'series', 'Welcome', 'NHK', 'part', 'comedy/part', 'drama', 'best', 'comedy', 'meaningful', 'best', 'drama', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'Sato', 'hikikomori', 'hope', 'spelled', 'right', 'basically', 'unemployed', 'hermit', 'who', 'pressures', 'outside', 'world', 'How', 'Sato', 'reacts', 'outside', 'world', 'source', 'most', 'humor.First', ""'d"", 'like', 'rave', 'little', 'characters', 'noteworthy', 'characters', 'show', 'have', 'problems', 'sort', 'Sato', 'problem', 'focus', 'show', 'being', 'rather', 'self-absorbed', 'person', 'perspective', ""n't"", 'allow', 'learn', 'much', 'people', 'viewer', 'can', 'empathize', 'Misaki', 'Yamazaki', 'God', 'hope', ""'m"", 'getting', 'name', 'right', 'two', 'closest', 'friends', 'avoid', 'spoiling', 'too', 'much', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'Misaki', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'apparently', 'help', 'Sato', 'overcome', 'problems', 'reason', 'other', 'kindness', 'Yamazaki', 'Otaku', 'rage', 'issues.The', 'animation', 'excellent', 'few', 'exceptions', 'couple', 'look', 'terrible', 'wonder', 'intentionally', 'designed', 'way', 'sooo', 'different', 'rest', 'show', 'music', 'amazing', 'really', 'mood', 'series', 'especially', 'Dancing', 'Baby', 'Human', 'ending', 'song', 'first', 'disk', 'so', 'high', 'point', 'show', 'however', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'things', 'happen', 'characters', 'rather', 'extreme', 'situations', 'do', 'crop', 'up', 'how', 'characters', 'react', 'situations', 'Sato', 'first', 'reaction', 'situation', 'be', 'addiction', 'escapism', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'introspective', 'sessions', 'follow', 'boughts', 'hedonist', 'revelry', 'tend', 'be', 'brutal', 'tainted', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'called', 'psychosis', 'Misaki', 'puzzle', 'first', 'seeds', 'character', 'are', 'planted', 'start', 'neighbor', 'best', 'friend', 'Yamazaki', 'much', 'more', 'complex', 'abrasive', 'behavior', 'misogynistic', 'rants', 'are', 'product', 'real', 'pain', 'writers', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'making', 'character', 'sympathetic', 'many', 'faults.If', ""'re"", 'interested', 'character', 'studies', 'psychology', 'dream', 'analysis', 'scene', 'funniest', 'thing', 'have', 'seen', 'ages', 'buy', 'series', 'immeadiately', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'put', 'off', 'numerous', 'reverances', 'deviant', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'very', 'honest', 'show', 'factors', 'internet', 'pornography', 'hentai', 'games', 'did', ""n't"", 'enter', 'point']",Welcome to the NHK: Complete Series

I actually managed to laugh a good amount of times while watching this series and it is not easy to get me to laugh. Most of us should have no problem relating to this anime series because it is about an anti social person.Tatsuhiro (the main character) never goes outside unless its night and he needs food. He blames the NHK for all of his problems. He is called a neat (a hermit that never leaves his house). Then one day a girl (Misaki) comes up to his door and tries to sell him a magazine about neats. She later tells him that she wants to cure him of being a neat. He eventually agrees and they go through and over come many challenges and of course Tatsuhiro falls in love with her.This is an amazing anime that will leave with a different perspective on life after you finish it. If you were anti social at one point in your life you will love this anime and even if you were not you still probably will enjoy it. All of the characters are easy to relate to and you can always manage to find some humor in every situation.

There are over a dozen reviews on Welcome to the NHK that you'll get a good perspective into the series.  Each review in that thread is full of unique philosophical insight -- which shows the power of this series.The series does start off somewhat slow and wired in nature.  The story focuses on the depressive state of the main character, and someone who is mainstream might not get into the series right off the bat.  That being said the anime progresses very nicely and the characters become fully developed towards the end.  The relationships between all of the characters is what steals the show of the anime and serves as the backbone of series.

1260247,A2C2T9R7V2LRLJ,B002BWD73W,Lazar,"[0, 0]","Anime is one of the great joys of my life.  I tend to research my shows before viewing, scoping reviews before renting or hooking up the laptop, because I would hate to waste any of my precious watching time on a load of crap.  It has unfortunately happened a few times, and I'm always piqued when it does.  On the other hand, I've also seen some animes so good, so well done, that my expectations were exceeded.  Enter Welcome to the NHK.I think what appealed to me most about this series was it's realism.  NHK is not a college drama; its action exists rather on the fringes of this environment.  However, for those of us who have entered a college away from home, and have experienced the type of world within which Satou, Yamizaki, and Misaki survive, this show is about as true-to-life as you can get.  For many of us, college did not offer the experiences portrayed in movies like ""Animal House"" or ""Van Wilder""; its aftermath--joblessness for many--is simply too disheartening for most comedies.  NHK nods towards those who strive on the outskirts to realize some great dream, no matter how trivial others might think it.  We see the underbelly of life as a 20-something college drop-out, with the depression, loneliness, and unemployment that often accompanies it.That being said, this is a comedy, and a really good one.  I've noticed some reviews claiming that NHK is depressing, but frankly I can't see it.  While the problems it wrestles with are real (internet suicide, multi-level marketing, MMO addiction, to name a few), NHK never becomes bogged down in its own subject matter.  The characters remain sympathetic and likable, and the show holds tight to its humor throughout.  What we get is a show that understands the failings of young people faced with city life, but one that believes that life finds a way.  We may not end up where we want to be, and we may not be better off for it, but we live.If you think you might enjoy a story about the interactions between disparate yet equally socially repressed characters, then this show may be for you.  If you enjoy slice-of-life animes in general, then please watch this immediately.

Weiss ""mweiss_reason_man""","[1, 1]","(Reader note: my review is based on the Japanese dialog version, not the English dub.)I'm glad I stuck it out with this series, because initially, I was put off by the craziness and the anthropomorphic animation in the first episode. But it gets better as it progresses, and by episode 5, you'll be hooked.This is a largely negative world view story, but the situations that many viewers will find personally identifiable will have you yelling &#34;YES!! I've BEEN there!&#34; whether it's the multilevel marketing scheme where you demonstrated detergents by dissolving them in glasses of water (yup, did that forty years ago), or the struggle to write video games, or the problems of just coming out of your apartment after adjusting to a lifestyle of being alone for too long, it's all in there. Anyone who's had a dysfunctional past will immediately identify with the main character, Tatsuhiro Sato.One of the strong appealing characters in this series is Misaki Nakahara, the &#34;girl next door&#34;, who one day, happens upon Sato's apartment while doing door to door visits with her aunt's religious group. She is largely a mysterious character for most of the show's run, but in the last few episodes we learn of her unfortunate and dysfunctional past, making her one of the more tragic characters whom we feel sympathy for.Sato is constantly scheming with Kaoru Yamazaki, an underclassman whom he knew from school, and the source of annoying &#34;Puru Puru Pururin&#34; theme music that seems to constantly play on his computer in the apartment next door. Kaoru convinces Sato to help him write and produce computer video games, called &#34;Gal Games&#34; to appeal to the &#34;hentai&#34; anime fans in the marketplace. He's scheming, always coming up with ideas to &#34;make it big&#34; and Sato gets suckered into it all because he wants to convince Misaki that he's up to something productive and that he'll make a good living at it one day.Another notable character from Sato's past is Hitomi Kashiwa. She was his upper classman in high school and a fellow conspiracy theorist. Her attitude is somewhat dark and malevolent, because of her deep immersion in conspiracy beliefs, and probably influenced Sato into becoming the somewhat negative person he was throughout this series. She makes recurring appearances from time to time and is a fascinating personality.As the episodes progress, a series of interesting circumstances arise and often, they are situations that could be a chapter out of the lives of any person who has tried many ways to make a living.The conclusion isn't nearly as satisfying as I'd have liked, but there are hints that things will go in a better direction. Still, I would have liked to see Sato have more trust in Misaki.This is a series which I will watch again in the future. It's certainly one to make you think about aspects of life that we don't frequently give much thought to.

I wasn't sure if i wanted to keep watching at first, and was afraid i wasted my money.  However, i only paid 11 dollars for it and figured might as well keep watching.  The more i watched the more i began to understand and more i started to enjoy the series.  By the time i got to the 5th episode i was hooked and couldn't believe i almost stopped watching.The story begins with the introduction of the main character Satou, who is a Hikikomori.  Meaning that he secludes himself from the outside world.  After his first encounter with Misaki, Satou decides to go search for a job.  He decides to apply at this manga shop, where he runs into Misaki again and runs out of the shop.  This is his first step into starting a new life.  Misaki eventually starts a contract with Satou that is a promise to help him end his Hikikomori ways.Along the way he also finds out that his neighbor who had been blasting annoying anime music, was actually an old high school classmate, who he had once saved from bullies.  His name is Yamazaki.With his new friend and old friends Satou struggles to find his way.  Their is triumph and failures along the way and Satou must struggle through the emotional roller-coaster.If you know what it is like to want to close yourself off to the outside world, you will understand what Satou is going through.  I lost a lot of people in my life and went through a time of seclusion myself and so i came to understand the main character quite well.

1260255,A315DYNLQAYGQH,B002BWD73W,Mr. V. Lee,"[3, 3]","This is a series I have wanted to watch for a long time. Another that was featured in NEO magazine a couple of years back but as always the UK release of anime lags behind the American releases.  I always try and wait for a box set and seeing the SAVE edition I just had to treat myself.The series eases you into the daily life of a shut-in, socially inept, waster of a young man who had just turned 22. He's been out of college and out of work for four years.  Now I am 22 myself and just finished college myself so for the last few months I've been feeling a bit like a hikkikomori myself.  It makes me rethink my life that it needs to go beyond helping out the family business or bantering around with the people in the boys club/karate dojo.The series is a little disturbing at times in how extreme it can take things, how a lonely, depressed guy things and especially when he is ""comfortable"" in his own little bubble (for example living day-by-day on instant foods, porn, games, dodgy anime music). It also portrays a little bit of the psychotic and paranoia.  You find yourself rooting for Sato (the protagonist) despite all that and his journey into a ""normal"" life through the help of a girl who has taken pity on him and provides him with counseling and daily goals.I watched it in the Japanese dub with English subtitles. I would consider a rewatch in English though since one of the other reviews mentioned it. But since the hikkikomori problem is probably more common in Japan and its otaku culture  I think watching the series in Japanese is ok too.  This series touches on some themes from the series ""Chobits"" by CLAMP... the personal computer/ persocom. The longing for company... the sex (apparatus/tools/dolls/imagery)... and the remedial classes/NEET (neither in education, employment nor training).If you are an anime/game/Japan nerd, give this series a go.

1260257,AHF97M45JFCB,B002BWD73W,ONENEO,"[72, 86]","There are some anime properties that you really can't imagine working in any other medium.  Sure anime is very closely related to its manga cousin but comics fail to deliver when things really get zany and personable.  Welcome to the N-H-K is exactly one such property.  It's so unique on so many levels that it's actually hard to believe it came out of the typically conservatively regarded Gonzo studios.  But before we get ahead of ourselves here, let's take a look at the hard facts.Originally released by ADV Films, Funimation has recently acquired the rights to the show and has wasted little time in getting a Complete Series release out to the public.  Coming in at a total runtime of 600 minutes, Welcome to the N-H-K the Complete Series spans 4 discs and comes packaged as a pair of thin packs within a cardboard slipcase.The show wears an appropriate TV MA (17+) rating, which is surprising should you base the show on the previews alone (a more accurate depiction of what's in store would be to check out the cover art and its foaming can of beer, pair of scantily clad women, and lead character looking slightly neurotic).Language options are typical sub & dub meaning the option of original Japanese dialog track (stereo) or an English dub (5.1 Dolby Surround) and English subtitles available under either language choice.Extras are limited to textless songs and a host of Funimation trailers.I'll do my best to summarize the story without giving away any spoilers.  The viewer is introduced to Sato, a college dropout who has just about had all he can take of society.  So withdrawn from society is our hero that he locks himself up in his dreary apartment where his very grip on reality is becoming more and more twisted by the day.His own delusions coupled to his lack of outside contact result in his becoming convinced that he is the subject of a vast conspiracy designed keep him under wraps by the secretive agency known as the N-H-K.Like most mentally ill individuals, being a delusion-suffering recluse results in a twist of incredible fortune when a friendly, pretty, and just generally good hearted young lady named Misaki shows up one day out of the blue with intentions of getting old depressed Sato back into society.The lead character pair ends up becoming a trio once the loud-music bumping neighbor of Sato's (and an old high-school pal, it turns out) joins the fray.  In all this unlikely team makes it their mission to rehabilitate the ever-degenerating mental and social health of Sato through a sort of long and drawn out intervention.Believe it or not, this is a comedy anime title despite what you may have figured after reading the summary.  It's based on a novel, which although I haven't had the pleasure of reading personally, can't possibly capture the oddity and personality that the anime just relishes in around every corner.The core of the show alternates between a cityscape reality and the hallucinations of Sato, which sometimes border on sexual fantasies.  I should note that there is no real nudity involved in said scenarios, but rather provocative outfits and a bit of suggestive dialog.  It is the language that earns this show a majority of its MA rating here in the US.A lot of the show's charm stems from the age-old gag of presenting a fairly ""out there"" conspiracy theory that can never fully be dismissed by the viewer.  The show's creative team does a great job painting a lead character who is clearly suffering from social dysfunction although there are moments along the way where you can't help but wonder if indeed some other forces (like a top-secret agency for example) aren't at play.The biggest problem I had with the show is that it lacks consistency in nearly sense of the term.  There are some genuinely funny moments but they are few and far between.  There are some intriguing psychological undertones that slip away to cheap attempts at humor.  There are some nice textures and visuals on occasion but more often than not you'll be looking at art that simply gets the job done.  About the only aspect of this program that holds steady is the soundtrack, which includes some smooth melodies and catchy J-Pop numbers throughout.The acting work is solid in both language options, with the Japanese dialog squeaking into the top-spot thanks to a female actor ensemble that feel almost custom tailored to the material.In all, this is definitely not a show for everyone, nor is the silly/ goofy type of light-hearted romp that previews suggest.  It's really a tragic tale if you allow yourself to look beyond the bright visuals and giddy personalities that make up the superficial.  Pacing is nice and swift even if the show does struggle at times to firmly establish itself into a genre.",3,For Those Who Like Their Comedy Twisted,1250726400,"08 20, 2009",2009,4758,"['are', 'anime', 'properties', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'working', 'other', 'medium', 'Sure', 'anime', 'very', 'closely', 'related', 'manga', 'cousin', 'comics', 'fail', 'deliver', 'when', 'things', 'really', 'get', 'zany', 'personable', 'Welcome', 'N-H-K', 'exactly', 'one', 'such', 'property', 'so', 'unique', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'actually', 'hard', 'believe', 'came', 'typically', 'conservatively', 'regarded', 'Gonzo', 'studios', 'get', 'ahead', 'ourselves', 'here', 'let', 'take', 'look', 'hard', 'facts.Originally', 'released', 'ADV', 'Films', 'Funimation', 'recently', 'acquired', 'rights', 'show', 'wasted', 'little', 'time', 'getting', 'Complete', 'Series', 'release', 'public', 'Coming', 'total', 'runtime', '600', 'minutes', 'Welcome', 'N-H-K', 'Complete', 'Series', '4', 'discs', 'packaged', 'pair', 'thin', 'packs', 'cardboard', 'slipcase.The', 'show', 'appropriate', 'TV', 'MA', '17+', 'rating', 'surprising', 'should', 'base', 'show', 'previews', 'alone', 'more', 'accurate', 'depiction', 'what', 'store', 'would', 'be', 'check', 'out', 'cover', 'art', 'foaming', 'can', 'beer', 'pair', 'scantily', 'clad', 'women', 'lead', 'character', 'looking', 'slightly', 'neurotic', '.Language', 'options', 'are', 'typical', 'sub', 'dub', 'meaning', 'option', 'original', 'Japanese', 'dialog', 'track', 'stereo', 'English', 'dub', '5.1', 'Dolby', 'Surround', 'English', 'subtitles', 'available', 'language', 'choice.Extras', 'are', 'limited', 'textless', 'songs', 'host', 'Funimation', 'trailers.I', ""'ll"", 'do', 'best', 'summarize', 'story', 'giving', 'away', 'spoilers', 'viewer', 'introduced', 'Sato', 'college', 'dropout', 'who', 'just', 'about', 'had', 'can', 'take', 'society', 'So', 'withdrawn', 'society', 'hero', 'up', 'dreary', 'apartment', 'where', 'very', 'grip', 'reality', 'becoming', 'more', 'more', 'twisted', 'day.His', 'own', 'delusions', 'coupled', 'lack', 'outside', 'contact', 'result', 'becoming', 'convinced', 'subject', 'vast', 'conspiracy', 'designed', 'keep', 'wraps', 'secretive', 'agency', 'known', 'N-H-K.Like', 'most', 'mentally', 'ill', 'individuals', 'being', 'delusion-suffering', 'recluse', 'results', 'twist', 'incredible', 'fortune', 'when', 'friendly', 'pretty', 'just', 'generally', 'good', 'hearted', 'young', 'lady', 'named', 'Misaki', 'up', 'one', 'day', 'blue', 'intentions', 'getting', 'old', 'depressed', 'Sato', 'back', 'society.The', 'lead', 'character', 'pair', 'up', 'becoming', 'trio', 'loud-music', 'bumping', 'neighbor', 'Sato', 'old', 'high-school', 'pal', 'out', 'fray', 'unlikely', 'team', 'mission', 'rehabilitate', 'ever-degenerating', 'mental', 'social', 'health', 'Sato', 'sort', 'long', 'drawn', 'out', 'intervention.Believe', 'not', 'comedy', 'anime', 'title', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'figured', 'reading', 'summary', 'based', 'novel', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'pleasure', 'reading', 'personally', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'capture', 'oddity', 'personality', 'anime', 'just', 'relishes', 'corner.The', 'core', 'show', 'cityscape', 'reality', 'hallucinations', 'Sato', 'sometimes', 'border', 'sexual', 'fantasies', 'should', 'note', 'real', 'nudity', 'involved', 'said', 'scenarios', 'rather', 'provocative', 'outfits', 'bit', 'suggestive', 'dialog', 'language', 'show', 'majority', 'MA', 'rating', 'here', 'US.A', 'lot', 'show', 'charm', 'age-old', 'gag', 'presenting', 'fairly', 'there', 'conspiracy', 'theory', 'can', 'never', 'fully', 'be', 'dismissed', 'viewer', 'show', 'creative', 'team', 'great', 'job', 'painting', 'lead', 'character', 'who', 'clearly', 'suffering', 'social', 'dysfunction', 'are', 'moments', 'way', 'where', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'indeed', 'other', 'forces', 'top-secret', 'agency', 'example', 'are', ""n't"", 'play.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'had', 'show', 'consistency', 'nearly', 'sense', 'term', 'are', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'moments', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'are', 'intriguing', 'psychological', 'undertones', 'slip', 'away', 'cheap', 'attempts', 'humor', 'are', 'nice', 'textures', 'visuals', 'occasion', 'more', 'often', 'not', ""'ll"", 'be', 'looking', 'art', 'simply', 'job', 'done', 'only', 'aspect', 'program', 'steady', 'soundtrack', 'smooth', 'melodies', 'catchy', 'J-Pop', 'numbers', 'throughout.The', 'acting', 'work', 'solid', 'language', 'options', 'Japanese', 'dialog', 'squeaking', 'top-spot', 'thanks', 'female', 'actor', 'ensemble', 'almost', 'custom', 'tailored', 'material.In', 'definitely', 'not', 'show', 'everyone', 'silly/', 'goofy', 'type', 'light-hearted', 'romp', 'suggest', 'really', 'tragic', 'tale', 'allow', 'look', 'bright', 'visuals', 'giddy', 'personalities', 'make', 'up', 'superficial', 'Pacing', 'nice', 'swift', 'even', 'show', 'struggle', 'times', 'firmly', 'establish', 'genre']",Welcome to the NHK: Complete Series

Sometimes curse words just get used to make the show seem more mature; and the chauvinistic sexuality gets a little annoying at times but the show manages to carry on through the really dumb parts to actually be somewhat refreshing in the homogenized world of anime.If you can enjoy a piece of life anime where the main character is battling a chronic masturbation addiction then this one is for you.
