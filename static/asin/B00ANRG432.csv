The film was made in New Zealand, and has a few familiar faces you might not be able to attach a name to,except Hayley Mills... if you're MY age. No objectionable material, but SOME people with hearing defects would probably preferCLOSED CAPTIONING or SUBTITLES to help out with the ""British"" accents.The little fellow that played Eli was wonderful.I commend all of the reviewers for NOT spoiling any twists 'n' turns in the movie. I'm a seasoned combat veteran, but, the filmmade me ""misty"", occasionally, as others stated.

For those of you who, like me, feel the typical Hallmark movie is becoming a bit cliched and boring, this is a welcome change. The atmosphere makes it a fun movie that breaks out of the standard family movie. Ioan Gruffudd's great acting paired with a pretty brilliant child actor also keep it exciting.
