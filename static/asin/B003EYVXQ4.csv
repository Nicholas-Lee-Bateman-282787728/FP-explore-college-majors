1339201,A24IJY3V0804WJ,B003EYVXQ4,Amit Talpade,"[1, 1]","This is another movie which has gained a lot of acclaim in 2010. A film about New York, I think would appeal mostly to people living in the big cities but should not prevent you from enjoying it. It deals with six principal characters for most of the movie and their interactions.Oliver Platt and Catherine Keener are antique art and furniture dealers. They somehow manage to sell furniture, mostly antiques with the help of the living relatives of dead people. Their marriage is great but somehow they have become friends instead of lovers. Platt is okay at with the ethics of the business but Keener is troubled by it, so much that she is forever trying to make amends to get rid of her guilt. They have a daughter who is going through a teenage phase in her life. They had recently purchased an apartment in the building that they have lived in for many years but the only problem is that it is occupied by a woman and her two nieces, who care for her. Over the course of a get together with these people, Platt and Amanda Peet, one of the nieces bond and have an extramarital affair. That really is the gist of the film, and may not appear interesting to many people, but trust me it is. I feel that the director did such a fantastic job in bringing this film from paper to film, that you just have to see it to appreciate. It was a Woody Allen film vibe in this for me, four stars. 11/9/10",4,One of the best of 2010,1294444800,"01 8, 2011",2011,1394,"['movie', 'gained', 'lot', 'acclaim', '2010', 'film', 'New', 'York', 'think', 'would', 'appeal', 'mostly', 'people', 'living', 'big', 'cities', 'should', 'not', 'prevent', 'enjoying', 'six', 'principal', 'characters', 'most', 'movie', 'interactions.Oliver', 'Platt', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'are', 'antique', 'art', 'furniture', 'dealers', 'somehow', 'manage', 'sell', 'furniture', 'mostly', 'help', 'living', 'relatives', 'dead', 'people', 'marriage', 'great', 'somehow', 'have', 'become', 'friends', 'instead', 'lovers', 'Platt', 'okay', 'ethics', 'business', 'Keener', 'troubled', 'so', 'much', 'forever', 'trying', 'make', 'amends', 'get', 'rid', 'guilt', 'have', 'daughter', 'who', 'going', 'teenage', 'phase', 'life', 'had', 'recently', 'purchased', 'apartment', 'building', 'have', 'lived', 'many', 'years', 'only', 'problem', 'occupied', 'woman', 'two', 'nieces', 'who', 'care', 'course', 'get', 'together', 'people', 'Platt', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'one', 'nieces', 'bond', 'have', 'extramarital', 'affair', 'really', 'gist', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'appear', 'interesting', 'many', 'people', 'feel', 'director', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'bringing', 'film', 'paper', 'film', 'just', 'have', 'see', 'appreciate', 'was', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'film', 'vibe', 'four', 'stars', '11/9/10']",N/A
1339202,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B003EYVXQ4,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 1]","There is a lot about `Please Give' that really works.  It can at times feel a little overdone, thanks to the countless amount of `growth' that each character has to undergo, but the end result is one that is thoroughly felt and appreciated by the audience.The film centers on two families that are drawn together by an elderly woman.  Kate and Alex make their living off the deceased.  They go in and pay the children of the deceased for all of the belongings that they don't want to deal with having to sort out and throw away.  Then, they sell them off.  They own a furniture store that specializes in valuable pieces that most of these `children' don't realize their parents owned.  As a side note, Kate and Alex are hoping their elderly neighbor, Andra, will kick the bucket sometime soon so they can buy her apartment and expand their own.  It doesn't hurt that their neighbor is a feisty old woman who makes it easy to wish her dead.  Her granddaughters, Mary and Rebecca, take care of her (sort of) and they strike up a semi-relationship with Kate, Alex and their daughter Abby.  Abby, young and impressionable as she is, is instantly smitten with Mary, a sharp tongued salon worker who flirts more than she should and speaks her mind, no matter the cost.  Alex also forms a liking for Mary.  She's pretty and slightly narcissistic and so she feeds off his attention.  All the while, Rebecca and Kate are dealing with their own set of internal issues.  Rebecca is struggling to connect with someone, but she is very guarded and cautious.  Kate has bigger issues to contend with.  She is guilty over the source of her income and her own lusting over the apartment next door.  She strives to mask her guilt by handing money to homeless people and volunteering but her own self loathing over her good fortune makes it nearly impossible for her to function in the `real world'.  She almost needs to be secluded in a bubble.  Abby has the normal teenage drama, and her desire for her mother to embrace her wealth causes her to lash out in undesirable ways.And Andra is a `side-plot' all her own.So, like I kind of mentioned on the outset of this review; there is a lot going on here and it can feel a tad congested.  Some of the plot twists feel generic or clich&eacute;d (the Alex/Mary fling for starters) but I kind of adore the way that the director, Nicole Holofcener, fleshes out these characters to make them feel real and genuine despite any sliver of familiarity.The ensemble cast is outstanding.  Oliver Platt is an actor who I have really liked for a long time now and I wish that he would get more roles like this, because he deserves them.  Rebecca Hall is slowly establishing her talent in this industry, and this is another notch on her belt; and we all know that Katherine Keener is just sublime all of the time.  Personally, this film is all about Ann Guilbert, Amanda Peet and Sarah Steele.  Guilbert is just hilarious as Andra.  She delivers such harsh words with this astute sense of destination.  That, and she's endearingly old.  Sarah Steele one-ups her charming wit that I saw in `Spanglish' (she was the total highlight to that overcooked movie), although I do fear that she has one trick.  Amanda Peet gives her best performance in years; quite possibly since `The Whole Nine Yards'.  She underscores the sharpness of her comments with a hidden pain that is nicked with the observations of others.Roving eyes unravel her.In the end, this is a very good film that I thoroughly enjoyed.  It says a lot, and the juggling of so many character arcs is hardly as jumbled a mess as it could have been, despite some obvious missteps.",4,"Give a lot, take a little...",1300924800,"03 24, 2011",2011,3652,"['lot', 'Please', 'Give', 'really', 'can', 'times', 'feel', 'little', 'overdone', 'thanks', 'countless', 'amount', 'growth', 'character', 'undergo', 'end', 'result', 'one', 'thoroughly', 'felt', 'appreciated', 'audience.The', 'film', 'centers', 'two', 'families', 'are', 'drawn', 'together', 'elderly', 'woman', 'Kate', 'Alex', 'make', 'living', 'deceased', 'go', 'pay', 'children', 'deceased', 'belongings', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'deal', 'having', 'sort', 'out', 'throw', 'away', 'Then', 'sell', 'off', 'own', 'furniture', 'store', 'valuable', 'pieces', 'most', 'children', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'parents', 'owned', 'side', 'note', 'Kate', 'Alex', 'are', 'hoping', 'elderly', 'neighbor', 'Andra', 'will', 'kick', 'bucket', 'sometime', 'soon', 'can', 'buy', 'apartment', 'expand', 'own', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'neighbor', 'feisty', 'old', 'woman', 'who', 'easy', 'wish', 'dead', 'granddaughters', 'Mary', 'Rebecca', 'take', 'care', 'sort', 'strike', 'up', 'semi-relationship', 'Kate', 'Alex', 'daughter', 'Abby', 'Abby', 'young', 'impressionable', 'instantly', 'smitten', 'Mary', 'sharp', 'tongued', 'salon', 'worker', 'who', 'more', 'should', 'speaks', 'mind', 'matter', 'cost', 'Alex', 'also', 'liking', 'Mary', 'pretty', 'slightly', 'narcissistic', 'so', 'attention', 'while', 'Rebecca', 'Kate', 'are', 'dealing', 'own', 'set', 'internal', 'issues', 'Rebecca', 'struggling', 'connect', 'someone', 'very', 'guarded', 'cautious', 'Kate', 'bigger', 'issues', 'contend', 'guilty', 'source', 'income', 'own', 'lusting', 'apartment', 'next', 'door', 'mask', 'guilt', 'handing', 'money', 'homeless', 'people', 'volunteering', 'own', 'self', 'loathing', 'good', 'fortune', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'function', 'real', 'world', 'almost', 'be', 'secluded', 'bubble', 'Abby', 'normal', 'teenage', 'drama', 'desire', 'mother', 'embrace', 'wealth', 'lash', 'out', 'undesirable', 'ways.And', 'Andra', 'side-plot', 'own.So', 'kind', 'mentioned', 'outset', 'review', 'lot', 'going', 'here', 'can', 'feel', 'tad', 'congested', 'plot', 'twists', 'feel', 'generic', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'Alex/Mary', 'fling', 'starters', 'kind', 'way', 'director', 'Nicole', 'Holofcener', 'characters', 'make', 'feel', 'real', 'genuine', 'sliver', 'familiarity.The', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'outstanding', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'actor', 'who', 'have', 'really', 'liked', 'long', 'time', 'now', 'wish', 'would', 'get', 'more', 'roles', 'Rebecca', 'Hall', 'slowly', 'establishing', 'talent', 'industry', 'notch', 'belt', 'know', 'Katherine', 'Keener', 'just', 'sublime', 'time', 'Personally', 'film', 'Ann', 'Guilbert', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'Sarah', 'Steele', 'Guilbert', 'just', 'hilarious', 'Andra', 'such', 'harsh', 'words', 'astute', 'sense', 'destination', 'endearingly', 'old', 'Sarah', 'Steele', 'one-ups', 'charming', 'wit', 'saw', 'Spanglish', 'was', 'total', 'highlight', 'overcooked', 'movie', 'do', 'fear', 'one', 'trick', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'best', 'performance', 'years', 'quite', 'possibly', 'Whole', 'Nine', 'Yards', 'sharpness', 'comments', 'hidden', 'pain', 'nicked', 'observations', 'others.Roving', 'eyes', 'unravel', 'her.In', 'end', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'lot', 'juggling', 'so', 'many', 'character', 'arcs', 'hardly', 'jumbled', 'mess', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'obvious', 'missteps']",N/A

I own all of them. I am so fascinated how she is so keenly tapped into the frailties of being human. Her characters are flawed yet lovable, as we see ourselves and those we love in them. She allows viewers to have compassion and understanding for some of the darkest characters. ""Please Give"" is one of her strongest pieces (and I love them all). What I find fascinating is that her films are not melodramatic tearjerkers, but I always find myself weeping at the humanity displayed on screen. Her writing and film making is a remarkable gift. Every word, every gesture, every pause is emotional. Truly emotionally captivating.Catherine Keener is, as always exceptional. She is Holofcener's muse and they must have a short hand. Keener plays the lead character with equals parts cynicism and heartbreak. The real revelation here is Amanda Peet, who delivers a heartbreaking performance. As a sister who is so emotionally defended she is cruel, Peet delivers one of the years best performances. She broke my heart.Attention to emotional detail is Holofcener's strong suit.

1339204,AO4WFALWQYTW0,B003EYVXQ4,"Bobby Hami ""Ultimateserge""","[14, 23]","The characters of Please Give are happy people. Their happiness is of a special kind that can best be described as contentment. Nearly everyone is filled with issues that are devouring them from within, but even in these conditions they are still content. These characters are all pretty wealthy, but despite their wealth they  are realizing the fitting saying: ""Money doesn't buy happiness.""When Kate and Alex move into a new neighborhood with their daughter Alex, they are confronted with a neighbor that they had not anticipated. Their neighbor is a ninety year old, Andra, whose bold honesty and impoliteness makes her seem like a sad person, but in her view these feeling are due to other people's jealousy. She admits that she lacks friends, but cites that her intellect caused resentment from others, making it difficult her to have any long-term friendship. Andra has a two granddaughters, the compassionate and friendly Rebecca, and the self-centered Mary who seems to to have inherited her grandmother's ungrateful attitude at an earlier age. The dynamic between these two families is very precarious considering that Kate and Alex have also bought Andra's house, but can only renovate it after she passes away.Since Little Miss Sunshine the indie community has become very successful in portraying family life and the issues surrounding it more successfully than major studio outing have done in a long time. Their success lies in the fact that they portray character's lives as regular American's actually live, and are uninterested with the glossy nature of Hollywood faire. Please Give's characters may be wealthy and spoiled, but their insecurities and worries are of that of any American family. As pleasant as it may be to see characters portraying people we can identify or actually be, it also endangers this film to conforming to many other indie film stereotypes.  However, what this film benefits from is brilliantly drawn characters that are portrayed by a group of talented actors with the utmost vitality. Of most interest is Amanda Peet as Mary who gets her characters menacing angst toward her grandmother with commendable passion. With such an insignificant plot, it is the performances that makes this film rise from meritocracy. The performances are intriguing because we seem to be gazing deeply at these individuals, as if this is a document of their lives, forgetting for sometime that this is a work of fiction.Please Give is not a sinking ship, but it is most identifiable to Titanic's momentary contact with an iceberg. For three-fourth's of the films the character's dynamic relationships are enough to keep the audience intrigued, but the film's conclusion gives us the realization that the director Holofcener is uninterested in resolving any of the concerns of the characters. Near the conclusion it hits us hard that this film was a just a large canvas for Holofcener to portray the lives of these characters. The issue is not that the ending is insignificant, but that it transforms this otherwise seemingly worthy film to a insignificant vanity project. As the film nears it end, it departs from it mission of displaying the struggles of these characters, and oddly transforms to a materialistic mess. There is no happy ending to this work, but rather a brutally, shameful, moralizing ending that gives all characters momentary satisfaction. Alex gains her dream gift, Alex marriage seems to be saved, and Andra finally realizes her deeply rotted jealousy. Praise has been bestowed upon this film for its avoidance of a confrontation, involving Andy, that has been seen multiple times on film. It is refreshing that this confrontation is absent, but why are there confrontations involving the female characters? Though the dispute may have been redundant, it still seems more appropriate than the confrontation that Mary undergoes. Holofcener has long been known for showing women as independent, but here she demonstrates that she is more open to lambasting the female characters than the male. Her approach would only be appropriate if she avoided criticizing any of the characters, but in this condition she has demonstrated that the male can succesfully escape withhis infidelity, while the female must live with her guilt.Verdict:Please Give utilizes perfect performances, but slowly unravels to show itself as a very imperfect film. Moralizing to the point of excess, this film proves that it lacked focus from the very start. Simply a vehicle for Holofcener to communicate the family dynamic, regardless of economic conditions.",2,"No film must have a sense of finality, but it must not escape so viciously from a conclusion, and still be so moralizing.",1278720000,"07 10, 2010",2010,4577,"['characters', 'Please', 'Give', 'are', 'happy', 'people', 'happiness', 'special', 'kind', 'can', 'best', 'be', 'described', 'contentment', 'Nearly', 'everyone', 'filled', 'issues', 'are', 'devouring', 'even', 'conditions', 'are', 'still', 'content', 'characters', 'are', 'pretty', 'wealthy', 'wealth', 'are', 'realizing', 'fitting', 'saying', 'Money', ""n't"", 'buy', 'happiness', 'When', 'Kate', 'Alex', 'move', 'new', 'neighborhood', 'daughter', 'Alex', 'are', 'confronted', 'neighbor', 'had', 'not', 'anticipated', 'neighbor', 'ninety', 'year', 'old', 'Andra', 'bold', 'honesty', 'impoliteness', 'seem', 'sad', 'person', 'view', 'feeling', 'are', 'due', 'other', 'people', 'jealousy', 'friends', 'intellect', 'caused', 'resentment', 'others', 'making', 'difficult', 'have', 'long-term', 'friendship', 'Andra', 'two', 'granddaughters', 'compassionate', 'friendly', 'Rebecca', 'self-centered', 'Mary', 'who', 'have', 'inherited', 'grandmother', 'ungrateful', 'attitude', 'earlier', 'age', 'dynamic', 'two', 'families', 'very', 'precarious', 'considering', 'Kate', 'Alex', 'have', 'also', 'bought', 'Andra', 'house', 'can', 'only', 'renovate', 'away.Since', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'indie', 'community', 'become', 'very', 'successful', 'portraying', 'family', 'life', 'issues', 'surrounding', 'more', 'successfully', 'major', 'studio', 'outing', 'have', 'done', 'long', 'time', 'success', 'fact', 'portray', 'character', 'lives', 'regular', 'American', 'actually', 'live', 'are', 'uninterested', 'glossy', 'nature', 'Hollywood', 'faire', 'Please', 'Give', 'characters', 'may', 'be', 'wealthy', 'spoiled', 'insecurities', 'worries', 'are', 'American', 'family', 'As', 'pleasant', 'may', 'be', 'see', 'characters', 'portraying', 'people', 'can', 'identify', 'actually', 'be', 'also', 'film', 'conforming', 'many', 'other', 'indie', 'film', 'stereotypes', 'However', 'what', 'film', 'benefits', 'brilliantly', 'drawn', 'characters', 'are', 'portrayed', 'group', 'talented', 'actors', 'utmost', 'vitality', 'most', 'interest', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'Mary', 'who', 'characters', 'menacing', 'angst', 'grandmother', 'commendable', 'passion', 'such', 'insignificant', 'plot', 'performances', 'film', 'rise', 'meritocracy', 'performances', 'are', 'intriguing', 'seem', 'be', 'gazing', 'deeply', 'individuals', 'document', 'lives', 'forgetting', 'sometime', 'work', 'fiction.Please', 'Give', 'not', 'sinking', 'ship', 'most', 'identifiable', 'Titanic', 'momentary', 'contact', 'iceberg', 'three-fourth', ""'s"", 'films', 'character', 'dynamic', 'relationships', 'are', 'enough', 'keep', 'audience', 'intrigued', 'film', 'conclusion', 'realization', 'director', 'Holofcener', 'uninterested', 'resolving', 'concerns', 'characters', 'conclusion', 'hard', 'film', 'was', 'just', 'large', 'canvas', 'Holofcener', 'portray', 'lives', 'characters', 'issue', 'not', 'ending', 'insignificant', 'otherwise', 'seemingly', 'worthy', 'film', 'insignificant', 'vanity', 'project', 'film', 'end', 'mission', 'displaying', 'struggles', 'characters', 'oddly', 'transforms', 'materialistic', 'mess', 'happy', 'ending', 'work', 'rather', 'brutally', 'shameful', 'moralizing', 'ending', 'characters', 'momentary', 'satisfaction', 'Alex', 'gains', 'dream', 'gift', 'Alex', 'marriage', 'be', 'saved', 'Andra', 'finally', 'deeply', 'rotted', 'jealousy', 'Praise', 'been', 'bestowed', 'film', 'avoidance', 'confrontation', 'involving', 'Andy', 'been', 'seen', 'multiple', 'times', 'film', 'refreshing', 'confrontation', 'absent', 'why', 'are', 'confrontations', 'involving', 'female', 'characters', 'dispute', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'redundant', 'still', 'more', 'appropriate', 'confrontation', 'Mary', 'undergoes', 'Holofcener', 'long', 'been', 'known', 'showing', 'women', 'independent', 'here', 'more', 'open', 'lambasting', 'female', 'characters', 'male', 'approach', 'would', 'only', 'be', 'appropriate', 'avoided', 'criticizing', 'characters', 'condition', 'demonstrated', 'male', 'can', 'succesfully', 'escape', 'withhis', 'infidelity', 'female', 'must', 'live', 'guilt.Verdict', 'Please', 'Give', 'utilizes', 'perfect', 'performances', 'slowly', 'unravels', 'show', 'very', 'imperfect', 'film', 'Moralizing', 'point', 'excess', 'film', 'lacked', 'focus', 'very', 'start', 'Simply', 'vehicle', 'Holofcener', 'communicate', 'family', 'dynamic', 'regardless', 'economic', 'conditions']",N/A

But in writer/director Nicole Holofcener's indie dramedy Please Give, grandma Andra's impending death brings a riff between a neighboring married couple who's anticipating how they'll redecorate her apartment when she goes, and a further divide between her two opposite granddaughters--one of whom cannot stand being around her.Oscar nominee Catherine Keener (Capote) plays Kate, an antique store owner and proud mom and wife to Alex (played by Oliver Platt). Always generous, Kate can't walk by a homeless man without giving him the last $20 in her pocket. But she has an attack of the conscious when she realizes that she may be profiting from the death of others when she re-sells items of the deceased at her store. This realization for Kate forces her to rethink her purpose in life.Though Kate's tried to play nice with her neighbor Andra and her two granddaughters Rebecca and Mary [played by Rebecca Hall and Amanda Peet (in a shockingly better than decent performance)], she's usually met with aloofness and/or disdain. But an unusual dinner party gathering brings each character closer together, and some not for the best. Relationships are formed and circumstances force them to see themselves, and each other, for who they really are.Funny at times, Please Give is a surprisingly heartwarming coming-of-age film for six adults all passing through different stages of heir life. Peet gives a shockingly better than decent performance as the selfish granddaughter silently suffering from her own demons Mary and Rebecca Hall shines as the granddaughter who couldn't stop giving for her beloved grandmother until life forced her to see a brighter picture.

1339206,A11ZESNK9JXTHR,B003EYVXQ4,Coffee Klatch Reviews,"[8, 10]","Out of all movie genres, the one I head to first is the independent comedy drama. If it's that kind that also follows a group of characters in interwoven stories, even better. Please Give had Catherine Keener and Oliver Platt, two people who are often in films that I like. So, this movie had lots going for it. In theory. But if I hadn't looked up the writer/director (Nicole Holofcener) in IMDB, I would have thought this film was her first film. Yet, she also did Friends With Money, which I don't remember being so frustrated by. (Don't really remember it much at all, but at least it didn't leave me with a hugely negative memory.)Please Give just seemed off. For a while, I was trying to figure out the point of scenes. It was like Holofcener took some pre-existing film template and pasted scenes over the template at the appropriate places, yet, did not have the content, point, or continuity through scenes you need to have a story that is worth making. So we have some fairly well-to-do people who make a living by buying furniture from the children of recently deceased elderly people and selling it to other well-to-do people who don't mind paying exorbitant prices for, say, 60's kitsch. Keener's character is beginning to have angst over this state of affairs and Platt's character tells her to get out of the business then. Okay, this is a decent enough setup, but it is not developed at a professional level. It is as if Holofcener believes that ANY 90 minutes of film strung together in scenes that cut between characters qualifies as a movie. But it just ain't so. The scenes themselves need to be interesting and/or funny or SOMETHING and they need to lead somewhere. If I want a story that has very little point I could film my family from, say, 6:15 p.m. to 6:20 p.m., go over to my neighbor's family and film them from 6:20-6:25, and do this with three of my neighbors over a few days until I have 90 minutes of film and then just end the movie.

Kate is guilt-stricken about what she sees as the predatory nature of her business and the fact that they are waiting for their elderly neighbor Andra (Ann Guilbert) to die so they can take possession of her apartment and enlarge their own.  They have a surly, unhappy teenage daughter with skin issues (Sarah Steele).  Andra, a selfish and unkind old lady, is cared for by two granddaughters; Rebecca (Rebecca Hall) is dutiful and forgiving, always the peacemaker, while Mary (Amanda Peet) is self-involved and resentful.Director Nicole Holofcener's fine film shows how these characters interact with each other, showing that the closely observed details of everyday life can be absolutely riveting.  Although some characters are more likable than others, they are not presented in black and white.

1339208,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B003EYVXQ4,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","Filmmaker and screenwriter Nicole Holfcener definitely knows how to writer stories that involve complex relationships.From her 2006 hit film ""friends with money"" and the 2001 film ""Lovely & Amazing"", Holfcener has managed to craft a film titled ""Please Give"" with a smart, humorous, vibrant and enjoyable storyline and an emphasis on the characters. Managing to capture the complications and vulnerabilities in relationships between a husband and wife, a mother and daughter, the mother and those less fortunate and their relationship to those around them.""Please Give"" may not have been a spring blockbuster title but considering that this film was made for $3 million, screened in limited theaters, it did make over $4 million in the box office and also received mostly positive reviews and now, it's being released on Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics.VIDEO:""Please Give"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1).  The film doesn't have the detail that I would have expected but it's not due to how the film was mastered but that the film was shot using 16mm cameras.  So, there is less detail than a 35mm transfer.  But I'm not too surprised, considering that this film was made on a very tight and low budget.  For the most part, skin tones are natural, blacks are nice and deep.  But detail-wise, the picture quality is not as detailed as I would have liked but considering the circumstance, I was not expecting anything too significant and for the most part, picture quality is good...not great but good.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Please Give"" is presented in English and French 5.1 DTS-HD MA and this is pretty much a dialogue-driven film.  I didn't notice any surround usage or anything that required massive audio since most of the time, the film is shot in very few indoor locations.  But dialogue and lossless audio is clear and understandable from the center and front channels.Subtitles are presented in English, English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES""Please Give"" comes with the following special features in standard and high definition, English Stereo (and mono) and optional English subtitles:* Behind the Scenes of Please Give - (12:08) Featuring behind-the-scenes footage of the film.  Cast and crew talk about the story and about the characters.* Outtakes - (3:58) Outtakes from ""Please Give"" presented in standard def.* Nicole Holofcener Q&A; - (8:24) Featuring four Film Independent Q&A; sessions with writer/director Nicole Holofcener presented in standard def.  From discussion of working on the film, being uncomfortable about casting, her grandmother's influence on the film, working on new project and more.* Theatrical Trailer - (2:02) The original theatrical trailer for ""Please Give"".JUDGMENT CALL:If there is one thing that can be said about Nicole Holofcener's films, its her utilization of the actress Catherine Keener.  Together, the have worked magnificently in the four films they have done together and ""Please Give"" really showcases Catherine Keener, the actress, in possibly the most emotional role that she has had yet.For the role of Kate, Catherine Keener does an impeccable job of playing Kate, a woman who loves making money.  It's a drive to become successful but the fact that she preys on the grieving and the dead and almost shows no compassion by doing it, shows you that perhaps she is determined by greed and it's a lifestyle that has functioned quite well through her family and her husband has supported.Of course, this doesn't last as we see Kate being consumed by guilt and how it starts to consume her and make her an emotional mess.  I found it quite interesting to see how Kate's benevolence was not about the kindness in her heart but the guilt that because she profits from the dead, she feels that her helping the poor or taking care of those in need will make her a better person.  But she knows that random acts of kindness done on covering the the guilt.  The guilt that she is a greedy woman who preys on grieving families that don't know better and the dead for their own personal property.  And no matter what she does for charity and her random acts of kindness, her benevolence is not pure from the heart, it's out of guilt.  And life will not change for the better until she makes positive changes in her life.As we have seen in previous Holofcener films, she knows how to capture complex relationships and I felt the relationship between Kate and her daughter Abby was quite interesting.  For one, if a daughter requests her parents or starts to whine about their parents not wanting to buy them a $200 pair of jeans, most parents would not give in.  Especially for jeans at that price.But the difference is that Abby was brought up in a family that preys on dead people, profits highly on dead people and sees her mom just blowing money by giving $5-$20 bills to any homeless living around their street.  So, I can see how her daughter would be perturbed that her mother is willing to give out possibly hundreds of dollars a week to the homeless and nothing for her daughter, I can easily understand her daughter's resentment.  But I did enjoy the communicative spat between mother and daughter and both Catherine Keener and Sarah Steele did a good job on that.As for Oliver Platt, he played a very convincing role as the supportive husband but at the same time, showing him as a guy who also thinks between his legs, loves Howard Stern and ends up doing something that the viewer probably not have seen coming.  That was quite interesting.While the main storyline does tend to focus on Kate and her family, we do get quite a bit of Rebecca and Mary, the two granddaughters who are so different from each other.  Rebecca who is an introvert finds redemption when she finds a good guy that she ends up dating and then Mary being this mean, self-centered alcoholic that doesn't care what she says and does whatever she wants (and very interesting when see start to see young Abby starting to like Mary and how direct she is).These are complex relationships captured perfectly and the performances are well-done, to the point that they seem authentic, especially coming from Catherine Keener, who does a magnificent job.But if anything, it's the structure that Holofcener builds upon in this film that works.  Concentrating on six characters and how each are changed by their experiences throughout the film.  It was well-written and characters were well-developed.  In fact, we see a little of Holofcener's appreciation and influence by filmmaker Woody Allen in ""Please Give"" when it comes to the structure of the film, especially the utilization of unrelated segments.While ""Please Give"" is an entertaining film, one will feel that there should be more to the Blu-ray release.  For one, it would have been a wonderful film to have an audio commentary track by writer/director Nicole Holofcener and even some of the cast members.  But what we do get are outtakes, behind-the-scenes footage and short Q&A; with the director.  Picture quality is fine as it was shot via 16mm and audio is dialogue-driven, so it's not a Blu-ray release where you would expect anything significant but it is a good Blu-ray release.Overall, ""Please Give"" is deeply entertaining and satisfying. Its characters are contradictory, interesting and for the most part, we see them change by the end of the film.  ""Please Give"" is a well-done dramedy that aims to look at life, to enjoy life and not take advantage of it.  Sporting wonderful performances, it may not be significantly deep but it is a film that manages to win you over.Definitely a Blu-ray release worth watching!",4,"Blu-ray: ""Please Give"" is deeply

I don't care about people having more money or someone willing to give away their money against their own best interests and that of their child.But what these movies are really about is the motivation and the CHARACTER of the people doing these things.  It's not the acts themselvs.At the end of this movie - I can't spoil it - you realize that the mammagram sister does not do something - nor does her sister - that more cynical selfish, exploitive people in NYC definitely would do and then you realize that Catherine Keener's character as well as her family have all along done something very altruistic and thankless - and you would know this if you understood Manhattan (not NYC) real estate.I guess what I am seeing in these movies are veiled depictions of people who don't hurt other people and only when you think about what they could be like, do you realize they live lives of unthanked benevolence and kindness and goodwill towards others.",4,another surprisingly better than good movie from Nicole Holofcener,1367193600,"04 29, 2013",2013,1403,"['know', 'backhanded', 'second', 'movie', 'Holofcener', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'watched', 'something', 'else', 'was', 'found', 'be', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'many', 'interesting', 'points', 'other', 'one', 'being', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Friends', 'Money.The', 'reason', 'feel', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'interesting', 'surface', 'yes', 'am', 'shallow', 'always', 'think', 'who', 'what', 'lifestyles', 'choices', 'made', 'women', 'have', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'people', 'having', 'more', 'money', 'someone', 'willing', 'give', 'away', 'money', 'own', 'best', 'interests', 'child.But', 'what', 'movies', 'are', 'really', 'about', 'motivation', 'CHARACTER', 'people', 'doing', 'things', 'not', 'acts', 'themselvs.At', 'end', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'realize', 'mammagram', 'sister', 'not', 'do', 'something', 'sister', 'more', 'cynical', 'selfish', 'exploitive', 'people', 'NYC', 'definitely', 'would', 'do', 'then', 'realize', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'family', 'have', 'done', 'something', 'very', 'altruistic', 'thankless', 'would', 'know', 'understood', 'Manhattan', 'not', 'NYC', 'real', 'estate.I', 'guess', 'what', 'am', 'seeing', 'movies', 'are', 'veiled', 'depictions', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'other', 'people', 'only', 'when', 'think', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'do', 'realize', 'live', 'lives', 'unthanked', 'benevolence', 'kindness', 'goodwill', 'towards', 'others']",N/A

Both films have non-plots, but here I found a bit more to hold on to. Certain aspects, such as Keener's guilt concerning the core premise of her business, which is to profit from grief, are up front. But what of Platt's Alex having an affair with Amanda Peet? And the daughter's open disrespect for her parents? The argument over a $200.00 pair of jeans. That there is such a thing as a $200.00 pair of jeans makes my skin crawl.Maybe this is where I part ways with the film. It's well written and very well acted. There is not a weak performance in entire 90 minutes. But I just have a hard time feeling any sympathy for these people. The one exception would be Rebecca Hall. She is a genuinely decent person and as her shot at love seems to become more real, I felt good for her. But on the whole I thought these people needed a jolt of reality.This is a good watch.

But, for the rest of the country, we shall never look at Easterners again without thinking of this movie for it cemented in our minds our stereotype about that misanthropic nor'easter urban American subculture.

1339212,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B003EYVXQ4,Haunted Flower,"[8, 12]","""Please Give"" comes from the writer/director of ""Friends With Money"", Nicole Holofcener and while that movie explored themes of being rich and how the wealth is spread around through charity and what they weren't willing to spend money on, this one goes a similar route. ""Please Give"" explores a series of people who either are in need or have the capacity to give something needed to others and figuring out if they are doing it for the good of the recipient or just to ease their own selfish guilt/pity/sorrow. Most specifically, two granddaughters deal with their rude aging grandmother while her next-door neighbors who have purchased her apartment are technically waiting for her to pass away so they can renovate and the guilt of swooping in afterward begins to get to some of them.Rebecca Hall plays Rebecca and seems to be the only faultless character of the cast. She works in mammography and tends to her 91 year old grandmother on a daily basis along with caring for her dog and cleaning her apartment. Rebecca is shy and only seems to work for others and takes no time for herself and wants to be the peacekeeper always. The intimacy of her job takes so much out of her that she clams up and stays reserved around others until one patient's son takes a special interest.Rebecca's sister, Mary played by Amanda Peet puts so much emphasis on her own surface value that she never develops much beneath it. Mary is rude to her grandmother on the excuse that the old woman is mean. Mary seems directionless except for maintaining her tan and trying to find out what is so special about the woman her ex left her for and trying to tear her down to make herself feel better. Amanda Peet is scary talented at being cold and beautiful. Her logic for her behavior toward her grandmother only foreshadows how she herself will be treated in old age since she seems to be on the fast track to that bitterness.Catherine Keener's character, Kate appears to carry the weight of the suffering of the world on her shoulders. She feels so much guilt, pity, and grief when confronted with death and misfortune that the only way to quell some of that is to give back with money to homeless people on the street and others that she mistakenly assumes to be just for standing around outside bundled up. Kate attempts to volunteer her time for the less fortunate, but the emotion is too much to handle it. She is in a business of buying and reselling antique furniture, but feels so badly for the people whom she buys from that it begins to affect her reasoning and business sense.Catherine's husband, Alex is played by Oliver Platt sees no problem with the business they run together as he views it unemotionally (It's not personal, it's business) and even gives Kate an out that she can go do other things if she wants and can't handle it here. He is exasperated with her wishy-washyness and stubborn purchase of occasionally worthless pieces because she felt bad for someone. They work well together as partners, but this added stress makes him seek out an escape. He only has a minor role to play in the course of the film as with Holofcener's other films, this one focuses on women, their viewpoint, and their relationships with others.Their daughter, Abby played by Sarah Steele has her own issues with being a teenager with bad skin and wants to ally herself with beautiful Mary and embrace her ideals. All she yearns for throughout the movie is a pair of $235 jeans and the way she blows up at her mother when they go shopping or walk down the street is cringe-inducing and sadly accurate to high school mood swings. Abby goes so far as to snatch a bill out of the hand of a street person Kate just donated to under the objection that her mother worries more about perfect strangers than the needs of her own family. Uh...That is an interesting discussion point.Each character goes on a journey and ends in a different place than where they started, but as far as commentary on the subject of charity and giving, it seems we are being left up to our own discussions without a direct moral message for the audience. I was left with mixed feelings about the film and felt it lacked the focus to really drive home the objective.",4,"""Please Give"" follows in the footsteps of ""Friends with Money"" in exploration of women, relationships, and money",1277078400,"06 21, 2010",2010,4221,"['Please', 'Give', 'writer/director', 'Friends', 'Money', 'Nicole', 'Holofcener', 'movie', 'explored', 'themes', 'being', 'rich', 'how', 'wealth', 'spread', 'charity', 'what', 'were', ""n't"", 'willing', 'spend', 'money', 'one', 'similar', 'route', 'Please', 'Give', 'series', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'need', 'have', 'capacity', 'give', 'something', 'needed', 'others', 'figuring', 'out', 'are', 'doing', 'good', 'recipient', 'just', 'ease', 'own', 'selfish', 'guilt/pity/sorrow', 'Most', 'specifically', 'two', 'granddaughters', 'deal', 'rude', 'aging', 'grandmother', 'next-door', 'neighbors', 'who', 'have', 'purchased', 'apartment', 'are', 'technically', 'waiting', 'pass', 'away', 'can', 'renovate', 'guilt', 'swooping', 'afterward', 'get', 'them.Rebecca', 'Hall', 'Rebecca', 'be', 'only', 'faultless', 'character', 'cast', 'mammography', '91', 'year', 'old', 'grandmother', 'daily', 'basis', 'caring', 'dog', 'cleaning', 'apartment', 'Rebecca', 'shy', 'only', 'work', 'others', 'time', 'herself', 'be', 'peacekeeper', 'always', 'intimacy', 'job', 'so', 'much', 'up', 'stays', 'reserved', 'others', 'one', 'patient', 'son', 'special', 'interest.Rebecca', 'sister', 'Mary', 'played', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'so', 'much', 'emphasis', 'own', 'surface', 'value', 'never', 'much', 'Mary', 'rude', 'grandmother', 'excuse', 'old', 'woman', 'mean', 'Mary', 'directionless', 'maintaining', 'tan', 'trying', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'so', 'special', 'woman', 'ex', 'left', 'trying', 'tear', 'down', 'make', 'feel', 'better', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'scary', 'talented', 'being', 'cold', 'beautiful', 'logic', 'behavior', 'grandmother', 'only', 'how', 'will', 'be', 'treated', 'old', 'age', 'be', 'fast', 'track', 'bitterness.Catherine', 'Keener', 'character', 'Kate', 'carry', 'weight', 'suffering', 'world', 'shoulders', 'so', 'much', 'guilt', 'pity', 'grief', 'when', 'confronted', 'death', 'misfortune', 'only', 'way', 'quell', 'give', 'back', 'money', 'homeless', 'people', 'street', 'others', 'mistakenly', 'be', 'just', 'standing', 'around', 'outside', 'bundled', 'up', 'Kate', 'attempts', 'volunteer', 'time', 'less', 'fortunate', 'emotion', 'too', 'much', 'handle', 'business', 'buying', 'reselling', 'antique', 'furniture', 'feels', 'so', 'badly', 'people', 'whom', 'affect', 'reasoning', 'business', 'sense.Catherine', 'husband', 'Alex', 'played', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'problem', 'business', 'run', 'together', 'unemotionally', 'not', 'personal', 'business', 'even', 'Kate', 'out', 'can', 'go', 'do', 'other', 'things', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'here', 'exasperated', 'wishy-washyness', 'stubborn', 'purchase', 'occasionally', 'worthless', 'pieces', 'felt', 'bad', 'someone', 'work', 'well', 'together', 'partners', 'added', 'stress', 'seek', 'out', 'escape', 'only', 'minor', 'role', 'play', 'course', 'film', 'Holofcener', 'other', 'films', 'one', 'women', 'viewpoint', 'relationships', 'others.Their', 'daughter', 'Abby', 'played', 'Sarah', 'Steele', 'own', 'issues', 'being', 'teenager', 'bad', 'skin', 'ally', 'beautiful', 'Mary', 'embrace', 'ideals', 'movie', 'pair', '235', 'jeans', 'way', 'up', 'mother', 'when', 'go', 'shopping', 'walk', 'street', 'cringe-inducing', 'sadly', 'accurate', 'high', 'school', 'mood', 'swings', 'Abby', 'so', 'far', 'snatch', 'bill', 'hand', 'street', 'person', 'Kate', 'just', 'donated', 'objection', 'mother', 'worries', 'more', 'perfect', 'strangers', 'needs', 'own', 'family', 'Uh', 'interesting', 'discussion', 'point.Each', 'character', 'journey', 'different', 'place', 'where', 'started', 'as', 'far', 'commentary', 'subject', 'charity', 'giving', 'are', 'being', 'left', 'up', 'own', 'discussions', 'direct', 'moral', 'message', 'audience', 'was', 'left', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'film', 'felt', 'lacked', 'focus', 'really', 'drive', 'home', 'objective']",N/A

1339214,A9TG2NFA614S9,B003EYVXQ4,John F. Rooney,"[0, 0]","""Please Give"" is what used to be called a slice of life piece with comic and serious threads. It's the story of six people. A couple run a Manhattan vintage mid twentieth century furniture store. They get their stuff by buying it from the relatives of people who have passed away. The stuff is quite expensive. They have a sixteen-year-old daughter, Abby, who is basically a good kid even though she has a streak of teenage rebellion and neediness. Next door to the couple lives an old lady, Andra, who at ninety-one could soon pass away. If she does, the couple want to get hold of her apartment so they can expand their own. In a way they are like ghouls profiting from the dead, but if they don't someone else will do it.The cranky, sharp-tongued old lady has two grandchildren, sweet Rebecca who comes over almost every night to help her and run errands, and the other a cold-hearted, self-absorbed, very beautiful bitch, Mary, who has no use for the grandmother. Rebecca is too good to be true, and Mary is almost too hateful to be fully believed.The wife, Kate, is too giving and generous with street people. She even tries to give twenty dollars to a homeless man until her daughter insists on taking the money for herself. Kate tries to be generous and giving, but she doesn't understand where needy and handicapped people are coming from. She can't really help them, only make them feel worse about themselves. When she tries to volunteer with those in need, she is at a loss how to really help them because she needs help herself. Her conscience about buying property from the dead and profiting from it starts to bother her. Her husband Alex (Oliver Platt), full of contradictions, goes astray and is unfaithful to her.It's a great film of character studies. Each person is etched so fully. The acting is superb, but the ending might be a little too pat. Life has givers and takers, and some people who just want to go their own way and do their own thing. Kate and Rebecca have a lot in common, but Rebecca knows how to be useful and generous at the same time while Kate's sympathy needs a practical keel to keep it afloat. The film does some probing but doesn't venture so far below the gum line that it really hits those nerves that makes us really cringe and are deeply cathartic.Well worth your time and a very fine little film.",5,A Slice of Life and Death,1276387200,"06 13, 2010",2010,2344,"['Please', 'Give', 'what', 'used', 'be', 'called', 'slice', 'life', 'piece', 'comic', 'serious', 'threads', 'story', 'six', 'people', 'couple', 'run', 'Manhattan', 'vintage', 'mid', 'twentieth', 'century', 'furniture', 'store', 'get', 'stuff', 'buying', 'relatives', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'passed', 'away', 'stuff', 'quite', 'expensive', 'have', 'sixteen-year-old', 'daughter', 'Abby', 'who', 'basically', 'good', 'kid', 'even', 'streak', 'teenage', 'rebellion', 'neediness', 'Next', 'door', 'couple', 'old', 'lady', 'Andra', 'who', 'ninety-one', 'could', 'soon', 'pass', 'away', 'couple', 'want', 'get', 'hold', 'apartment', 'can', 'expand', 'own', 'way', 'are', 'ghouls', 'profiting', 'dead', 'do', ""n't"", 'someone', 'else', 'will', 'do', 'it.The', 'cranky', 'sharp-tongued', 'old', 'lady', 'two', 'grandchildren', 'sweet', 'Rebecca', 'who', 'over', 'almost', 'night', 'help', 'run', 'errands', 'other', 'cold-hearted', 'self-absorbed', 'very', 'beautiful', 'bitch', 'Mary', 'who', 'use', 'grandmother', 'Rebecca', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'true', 'Mary', 'almost', 'too', 'hateful', 'be', 'fully', 'believed.The', 'wife', 'Kate', 'too', 'giving', 'generous', 'street', 'people', 'even', 'give', 'twenty', 'dollars', 'homeless', 'man', 'daughter', 'taking', 'money', 'herself', 'Kate', 'be', 'generous', 'giving', ""n't"", 'understand', 'where', 'needy', 'handicapped', 'people', 'are', 'coming', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'help', 'only', 'make', 'feel', 'worse', 'When', 'volunteer', 'need', 'loss', 'how', 'really', 'help', 'help', 'herself', 'conscience', 'buying', 'property', 'dead', 'profiting', 'bother', 'husband', 'Alex', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'full', 'contradictions', 'astray', 'unfaithful', 'her.It', 'great', 'film', 'character', 'studies', 'person', 'etched', 'so', 'fully', 'acting', 'superb', 'ending', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'too', 'pat', 'Life', 'givers', 'takers', 'people', 'who', 'just', 'want', 'go', 'own', 'way', 'do', 'own', 'thing', 'Kate', 'Rebecca', 'have', 'lot', 'common', 'Rebecca', 'how', 'be', 'useful', 'generous', 'same', 'time', 'Kate', 'sympathy', 'practical', 'keel', 'keep', 'afloat', 'film', 'probing', ""n't"", 'venture', 'so', 'far', 'gum', 'line', 'really', 'nerves', 'really', 'cringe', 'are', 'deeply', 'cathartic.Well', 'time', 'very', 'fine', 'little', 'film']",N/A

1339220,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B003EYVXQ4,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[1, 3]","Nicole Holofcener's ""Please Give"" gradually drew me in as the movie progressed; it started somewhat slow but it became more meaningful and had a deeper flavor to it as the events unfolded and the characters were increasingly fleshed out. Initially it all seems almost one dimensional but as things progress we see that even unlikable people have good points about them; and that's one hallmark of good acting. The casting was well done and the plot moves along at a very good pace; I wasn't ever bored. The choreography and the cinematography worked well, too.When the action starts, we meet the main characters of the story. Alex and Kate (Oliver Platt and Catherine Keener) live with their teenage daughter Abby (Sarah Steele) in a Manhattan apartment building; and they have already purchased the apartment next door where elderly Andra (Ann Morgan Guilbert) will continue to live until she dies; then Alex and Kate can extend their apartment. Although Alex and Kate profess that they want Andra to live long, they privately hope she'll die soon so they can have a larger home; and all Abby really wants is a $200 pair of jeans and smooth skin which she doesn't have because of her acne. Andra doesn't exactly balance them out as a happy person; she's not very pleasant and it's almost as if she takes her dutiful granddaughter Rebecca (Rebecca Hall) for granted. Andra's other granddaughter Kate (Amanda Peet) is also a rather mean, superficial person who works doing facials and gets involved with Alex without any remorse for it. In addition, Alex and Kate spend their days buying mid-century furniture from the adult children of people who have died--and they sell each piece for way, way more than they paid--and for way more than it's probably ever going to be worth.Besides Rebecca, the only real exception to all this narcissism seems to lie within Kate. She wants to ""undo"" the selfish and exploitative things she has done and tries volunteering at several social work agencies.Of course, I could tell you more but that would involve too many spoilers! Suffice it to say that unexpected things happen and the plot will hold your attention if you like this type of movie.

1339221,A1H9EF4S5I9OKX,B003EYVXQ4,M. Bullions,"[0, 0]","Nicole Holofcener's newest slice-of-life tragicomedy Please Give has one of the most shocking openings I've seen in any film in the past few years, and it addresses a subject that rarely is discussed in polite society - women and the misery that generates from the necessary yearly mammogram.Rebecca Hall's character (also named Rebecca) is a mammogram technician, whose mother Andra (Ann Morgan Guilbert) is on her way out. While helping her through everyday life, her flaky sister Mary (Amanda Peet) is useless in the quest to make the last years of her mother's life as painless as possible. The story of Kate (Catherine Keener), a bleeding heart Liberal suffering from an incurable case of white guilt, and her philandering husband Alex (Oliver Platt) is woven into the tale. They own a store that sells items purchased from children of recently deceased individuals. They want to buy Andra's next-door apartment whenever she finally croaks. Tension, awkwardness, and quiet chaos ensue from that point forward.Holofcener is an autuer, much like Quentin Tarantino or Oliver Stone. Her films are usually driven by strong female characters, and they always tend to deal with matters that are very realistic and true to the viewer. While they might not be heavy on plot, they're very relatable, honest, incisive, and powerful, all at the same time.Holofcener has grown, as a director since her last feature, Friends With Money, which I also enjoyed greatly. While the characters in that film struggled with being alone, being poor, and suffering through menopause, the characters in this film deal with different dilemmas, such as, when you see a person who is homeless on your street block, what exactly can you do? What, exactly, is pushing it too far? Is there any right answer to any of life's dilemmas?Holofcener has also greatly grown as a writer since FWM. While some of the dialogue in her previous films felt somewhat contrived and forced, that's not the case here. The writing is top-notch. The audience may feel as if they're eavesdropping on the characters, which is always a good thing in a movie, for me. The characters feel so genuine and real, that you forget that they're even fictitious, and the dilemmas that they face are extremely realistic, and relatable.One of the marks of a Holofcener film is the presence of the great Catherine Keener. She is one of the few people in Hollywood who can do no wrong in any film that she stars in. She, however does her best work in Holofcener films, and this is no exception. Her character, in this one, is particularly well written, because of the character's realism. Her character has a soul, and doesn't have the typical, plastic, flat persona that Hollywood usually brings on for a woman in her mid-40s.While I don't think this film will translate to every audience, I think it's a gem for the summer. It's light on plot, but heavy on realism and insight. It's a character study that I've found more interesting than any film so far in 2010.",5,An astute and interesting character study,1277856000,"06 30, 2010",2010,3004,"['Nicole', 'Holofcener', 'newest', 'slice-of-life', 'tragicomedy', 'Please', 'Give', 'one', 'most', 'shocking', 'openings', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'subject', 'rarely', 'discussed', 'polite', 'society', 'women', 'misery', 'necessary', 'yearly', 'mammogram.Rebecca', 'Hall', 'character', 'also', 'named', 'Rebecca', 'mammogram', 'technician', 'mother', 'Andra', 'Ann', 'Morgan', 'Guilbert', 'way', 'helping', 'everyday', 'life', 'flaky', 'sister', 'Mary', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'useless', 'quest', 'make', 'last', 'years', 'mother', 'life', 'as', 'painless', 'possible', 'story', 'Kate', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'bleeding', 'heart', 'Liberal', 'suffering', 'incurable', 'case', 'white', 'guilt', 'philandering', 'husband', 'Alex', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'woven', 'tale', 'own', 'store', 'items', 'purchased', 'children', 'recently', 'deceased', 'individuals', 'want', 'buy', 'Andra', 'next-door', 'apartment', 'whenever', 'finally', 'croaks', 'Tension', 'awkwardness', 'quiet', 'chaos', 'ensue', 'point', 'forward.Holofcener', 'autuer', 'much', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'films', 'are', 'usually', 'driven', 'strong', 'female', 'characters', 'always', 'tend', 'deal', 'matters', 'are', 'very', 'realistic', 'true', 'viewer', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'heavy', 'plot', ""'re"", 'very', 'relatable', 'honest', 'incisive', 'powerful', 'same', 'time.Holofcener', 'grown', 'director', 'last', 'feature', 'Friends', 'Money', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'greatly', 'characters', 'film', 'struggled', 'being', 'alone', 'being', 'poor', 'suffering', 'menopause', 'characters', 'film', 'deal', 'different', 'dilemmas', 'such', 'when', 'see', 'person', 'who', 'homeless', 'street', 'block', 'what', 'exactly', 'can', 'do', 'What', 'exactly', 'pushing', 'too', 'far', 'there', 'right', 'answer', 'life', 'dilemmas', 'Holofcener', 'also', 'greatly', 'grown', 'writer', 'FWM', 'dialogue', 'previous', 'films', 'felt', 'somewhat', 'contrived', 'forced', 'not', 'case', 'here', 'writing', 'top-notch', 'audience', 'may', 'feel', ""'re"", 'eavesdropping', 'characters', 'always', 'good', 'thing', 'movie', 'characters', 'feel', 'so', 'genuine', 'real', 'forget', ""'re"", 'even', 'fictitious', 'dilemmas', 'face', 'are', 'extremely', 'realistic', 'relatable.One', 'marks', 'Holofcener', 'film', 'presence', 'great', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'one', 'few', 'people', 'Hollywood', 'who', 'can', 'do', 'wrong', 'film', 'however', 'best', 'work', 'Holofcener', 'films', 'exception', 'character', 'one', 'particularly', 'well', 'written', 'character', 'realism', 'character', 'soul', ""n't"", 'have', 'typical', 'plastic', 'flat', 'persona', 'Hollywood', 'usually', 'woman', 'mid-40s.While', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'will', 'translate', 'audience', 'think', 'gem', 'summer', 'light', 'plot', 'heavy', 'realism', 'insight', 'character', 'study', ""'ve"", 'found', 'more', 'interesting', 'film', 'so', 'far', '2010']",N/A

In many ways, they are reminiscent of characters from a Woody Allen movie, but they speak in a different rhythm; the rhythm of writer-director Nicole Holofcener.Catherine Keener and Oliver Platt play a successful married couple, owners of a vintage furniture store who obtain their inventory at bargain prices from the estates of the newly deceased.  Their daughter (Sarah Steele) is a typical teenager, burdened with overly bad skin problems.Wanting to enlarge their apartment,  Keener and Platt have purchased the unit next to them, but they can't begin remodeling until the current resident, 91-year old and mean-spirited Ann Guilbert, dies or is taken to a nursing home.  Her granddaughters, equally outspoken Amanda Peet and overly shy Rebecca Hall, care for Guilbert.Keener's feelings of guilt over her business practices, Platt's attraction to the unstable Peet and Hall's deep longing to emerge from her emotional cocoon propel these troubled, quite believable characters to alter their lives...at least, for the moment.Ms. Holofcener has assembled a likable, talented cast and given them an endearing screenplay with which to work.Extras on the DVD from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment  include outtakes, a ""Behind the Scenes"" featurette and a Q&A; with Holofcener.

She clearly has a gift for the female take on life.  The movie is wonderfully acted with the always good Catherine Keener as Kate who has successful business reselling furniture they purchase from the heirs of the departed.  She feels guilty and looks for some charitable work.  She and her husband Alex (Oliver Platt) have their eyes on their elderly neighbor's rent controlled apartment.  The additional cast features Rebecca Hall and Amanda Peet as the neighbor's grandchildren.  The film is straight forward and honest.  It doesn't throw in diversions (well, one) and tricks.

1339224,A3KR9Q99D1EGEB,B003EYVXQ4,"Odysseus ""A Traveller""","[7, 12]","Perhaps it's somewhat unfair to review a film that one gives up on after only an hour; if the film redeems itself in its final minutes, I would not know.  But the fact that I did give up on it after an hour is itself indicative; of the dozens upon dozens of films that I watched over the last couple of years, this is one of only two that I simply could not continue to the end.  Every minute of watching was unpleasant, and it felt more like torture than anything else.After abandoning the effort, I felt like sending a telegram to every director and studio in the US:  PLEASE STOP MAKING FILMS LIKE THIS.  Enough with the dysfunctional families. Enough with the wry, presumably ironic but painfully unfunny dialogue.  Even with the narcissism and lack of self-awareness.  Enough with the self-congratulatory post-film discussion about how this is ""reality"" and ""honesty.""  (On a personal note, I like challenging, often disturbing films, and have no desire to see an antiseptic treatment of American family life; but this film and others like it do NOT represent my reality.  If I had to live among people like this, I would hang myself.)The ""plot,"" such as it is, involves characters played by Catherine Keener and Oliver Platt, a married couple who buy up future left behind by the recently deceased, mark up the prices dramatically and re-sell it; they also have plans to buy up the apartment space of a yet-to-be-deceased person.  On the surface, they seem like decent, charitable people, but there is an undercurrent of moral concern about the vulture-like nature of the way they make their living.The film spends most of its first hour smacking you over the head with the central contradiction of the Catharine Keener character.  In the abstract, she wants to be compassionate and charitable -- she is constantly handing out food and money to the homeless, she is searching for volunteer opportunities. She has a highly developed social conscience.  But on a personal level, she could hardly be less considerate and compassionate.  She shows almost no empathy for her daughter's problems, and she incessantly says really inconsiderate things to offend other people, only catching herself after the fact.  The film really beats this into the ground; she has opportunities for compassion all around her, but she neglects them, in pursuit of the self-affirmation of charity towards faceless strangers.  You basically want to scream at the film:  ""OK, I get it, I get it.  Let up on this point!""The other notable aspect of the film is that everyone sits around saying the most rude, self-centered, obnoxious things, all in the same low-voiced monotone.  It's not interesting; it's not funny.  Keener and Platt's neighbors are ""caring"" for a 91-year-old grandmother on the brink of death.  The two girls are constantly bickering, and one in particular keeps saying horrible, insensitive things in front of Grandma, who returns the suspicion and contempt in kind.  A bit of this here and there would be tolerable -- but the entire first hour of the film is wasted on similarly horrid dialogue.  There are occasional attempts at humor (mostly by bringing up previously-introduced subjects again and again) but they fall flat.  Basically, the film consists of people saying insensitive things in front of each other in scene after scene.After an hour of this, one can't help but feel:  what the hell is the point? Nothing really happens, the moral contradiction of the Keener character is beaten into the ground, and all that one can feel is disgust at the shallow, unfeeling narcissim of the characters, and irritation at the cynicism of the film itself.  Nothing really interrupts the relentless torment of the viewer.No, this is not insightful, it's not entertaining, it's not amusing, it's not involving. It seems to be all in the service of an allegedly iconoclastic take on American life.All in all, one of the four worst films I have seen in the last five years.",1,The hour I watched was pure torture,1293926400,"01 2, 2011",2011,3969,"['Perhaps', 'somewhat', 'unfair', 'review', 'film', 'one', 'up', 'only', 'hour', 'film', 'final', 'minutes', 'would', 'not', 'know', 'fact', 'did', 'give', 'up', 'hour', 'indicative', 'dozens', 'dozens', 'films', 'watched', 'last', 'couple', 'years', 'one', 'only', 'two', 'simply', 'could', 'not', 'continue', 'end', 'minute', 'watching', 'was', 'unpleasant', 'felt', 'more', 'torture', 'anything', 'else.After', 'abandoning', 'effort', 'felt', 'sending', 'telegram', 'director', 'studio', 'US', 'PLEASE', 'STOP', 'MAKING', 'FILMS', 'LIKE', 'THIS', 'Enough', 'dysfunctional', 'families', 'Enough', 'wry', 'presumably', 'ironic', 'painfully', 'unfunny', 'dialogue', 'Even', 'narcissism', 'lack', 'self-awareness', 'Enough', 'self-congratulatory', 'post-film', 'discussion', 'how', 'reality', 'honesty', 'personal', 'note', 'like', 'challenging', 'often', 'disturbing', 'films', 'have', 'desire', 'see', 'antiseptic', 'treatment', 'American', 'family', 'life', 'film', 'others', 'do', 'NOT', 'represent', 'reality', 'had', 'live', 'people', 'would', 'hang', 'plot', 'such', 'characters', 'played', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'married', 'couple', 'who', 'buy', 'up', 'future', 'left', 'recently', 'deceased', 'mark', 'up', 'prices', 'dramatically', 're-sell', 'also', 'have', 'plans', 'buy', 'up', 'apartment', 'space', 'yet-to-be-deceased', 'person', 'surface', 'seem', 'decent', 'charitable', 'people', 'undercurrent', 'moral', 'concern', 'vulture-like', 'nature', 'way', 'make', 'living.The', 'film', 'most', 'first', 'hour', 'smacking', 'head', 'central', 'contradiction', 'Catharine', 'Keener', 'character', 'abstract', 'be', 'compassionate', 'charitable', 'constantly', 'handing', 'out', 'food', 'money', 'homeless', 'searching', 'volunteer', 'opportunities', 'highly', 'developed', 'social', 'conscience', 'personal', 'level', 'could', 'hardly', 'be', 'less', 'considerate', 'compassionate', 'almost', 'empathy', 'daughter', 'problems', 'incessantly', 'really', 'inconsiderate', 'things', 'offend', 'other', 'people', 'only', 'catching', 'fact', 'film', 'really', 'ground', 'opportunities', 'compassion', 'pursuit', 'self-affirmation', 'charity', 'towards', 'faceless', 'strangers', 'basically', 'want', 'scream', 'film', 'OK', 'get', 'get', 'Let', 'up', 'point', 'other', 'notable', 'aspect', 'film', 'everyone', 'saying', 'most', 'rude', 'self-centered', 'obnoxious', 'things', 'same', 'low-voiced', 'monotone', 'not', 'interesting', 'not', 'funny', 'Keener', 'Platt', 'neighbors', 'are', 'caring', '91-year-old', 'grandmother', 'brink', 'death', 'two', 'girls', 'are', 'constantly', 'bickering', 'one', 'particular', 'keeps', 'saying', 'horrible', 'insensitive', 'things', 'front', 'Grandma', 'who', 'suspicion', 'contempt', 'kind', 'bit', 'here', 'there', 'would', 'be', 'tolerable', 'entire', 'first', 'hour', 'film', 'wasted', 'similarly', 'horrid', 'dialogue', 'are', 'occasional', 'attempts', 'humor', 'mostly', 'bringing', 'up', 'previously-introduced', 'subjects', 'again', 'again', 'fall', 'flat', 'Basically', 'film', 'people', 'saying', 'insensitive', 'things', 'front', 'other', 'scene', 'scene.After', 'hour', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'what', 'hell', 'point', 'Nothing', 'really', 'moral', 'contradiction', 'Keener', 'character', 'beaten', 'ground', 'one', 'can', 'feel', 'disgust', 'shallow', 'unfeeling', 'narcissim', 'characters', 'irritation', 'cynicism', 'film', 'Nothing', 'really', 'interrupts', 'relentless', 'torment', 'viewer.No', 'not', 'insightful', 'not', 'entertaining', 'not', 'amusing', 'not', 'involving', 'be', 'service', 'allegedly', 'iconoclastic', 'take', 'American', 'life.All', 'one', 'four', 'worst', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'last', 'five', 'years']",N/A

Zwick,"[1, 2]","""Please Give"" is an insightful multi-character comedy/drama set in the bohemian section of The Big Apple.Kate (Catherine Keener) and Alex (Oliver Platt) are a married couple who run an antique furniture business, buying pieces from recently deceased elderly people, then re-selling them at exorbitant prices.  Kate assuages her guilt over this by handing out money to every panhandler she encounters on the street and by scouring the internet for volunteer opportunities posted on-line.  But she still feels like a ""ghoul,' waiting for old people to die, then swooping in on their belongings before the body has even had time to turn cold.  Meanwhile her husband and business partner, Alex, suffering from a midlife crisis, becomes romantically involved with Mary (Amanda Peet), a beautiful young but coldhearted cosmetologist, whose cranky and cantankerous grandmother (delightfully played by Ann Guilbert, Millie from ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"") lives right next door to Kate and Alex, who, in true ""ghoul"" fashion, are planning on buying her place when she dies in order to increase the square footage of their own residence.  The remaining characters include Mary's good-hearted sister, Rebecca (Rebecca Hall), a mammogram technician with a nonexistent love life; Eugene (Thomas Ian Nicholas), her wannabe boyfriend; and Eugene's grandmother (Lois Smith from ""Twister""), who's more concerned with playing matchmaker for her grandson than with her own cancer diagnosis.Together, these characters form an interesting and colorful tapestry for an urban tale about people who often question their own goodness but who are often reluctant to rectify the behavior that is causing the problem.  And there are those, like Mary and her grandmother, who seem almost completely immune to pangs of conscience or to any kind of moral self-reflection at all and see others as existing largely for their own benefit.Yet, all this makes the movie sound far more preachy, scolding and emotionally downbeat than it actually is.  In reality, the screenplay by Nicole Holofcner mines rich veins of humor from the quirky nature of the characters and the situations in which they find themselves, and the beautifully calibrated performances, along with Holofcner's subtle and thoughtful direction, greatly enrich the material.",4,Insightful urban comedy,1303171200,"04 19, 2011",2011,2306,"['Please', 'Give', 'insightful', 'multi-character', 'comedy/drama', 'set', 'bohemian', 'section', 'Big', 'Apple.Kate', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'Alex', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'are', 'married', 'couple', 'who', 'run', 'antique', 'furniture', 'business', 'buying', 'pieces', 'recently', 'deceased', 'elderly', 'people', 'then', 're-selling', 'exorbitant', 'prices', 'Kate', 'guilt', 'handing', 'out', 'money', 'panhandler', 'street', 'scouring', 'internet', 'volunteer', 'opportunities', 'posted', 'on-line', 'still', 'ghoul', 'waiting', 'old', 'people', 'die', 'then', 'swooping', 'belongings', 'body', 'even', 'had', 'time', 'turn', 'cold', 'Meanwhile', 'husband', 'business', 'partner', 'Alex', 'suffering', 'midlife', 'crisis', 'romantically', 'involved', 'Mary', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'beautiful', 'young', 'coldhearted', 'cosmetologist', 'cranky', 'cantankerous', 'grandmother', 'delightfully', 'played', 'Ann', 'Guilbert', 'Millie', 'Dick', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'Show', 'right', 'next', 'door', 'Kate', 'Alex', 'who', 'true', 'ghoul', 'fashion', 'are', 'planning', 'buying', 'place', 'when', 'order', 'increase', 'square', 'footage', 'own', 'residence', 'remaining', 'characters', 'include', 'Mary', 'good-hearted', 'sister', 'Rebecca', 'Rebecca', 'Hall', 'mammogram', 'technician', 'nonexistent', 'love', 'life', 'Eugene', 'Thomas', 'Ian', 'Nicholas', 'wannabe', 'boyfriend', 'Eugene', 'grandmother', 'Lois', 'Smith', 'Twister', 'who', 'more', 'concerned', 'playing', 'matchmaker', 'grandson', 'own', 'cancer', 'diagnosis.Together', 'characters', 'form', 'interesting', 'colorful', 'tapestry', 'urban', 'tale', 'people', 'who', 'often', 'question', 'own', 'goodness', 'who', 'are', 'often', 'reluctant', 'rectify', 'behavior', 'causing', 'problem', 'are', 'Mary', 'grandmother', 'who', 'seem', 'almost', 'completely', 'immune', 'pangs', 'conscience', 'kind', 'moral', 'self-reflection', 'see', 'others', 'existing', 'largely', 'own', 'benefit.Yet', 'movie', 'sound', 'far', 'more', 'preachy', 'scolding', 'emotionally', 'downbeat', 'actually', 'reality', 'screenplay', 'Nicole', 'Holofcner', 'mines', 'rich', 'veins', 'humor', 'quirky', 'nature', 'characters', 'situations', 'find', 'beautifully', 'calibrated', 'performances', 'Holofcner', 'subtle', 'thoughtful', 'direction', 'greatly', 'material']",N/A
1339228,AIVW1JAT9T44,B003EYVXQ4,"Rustin Parr ""Rustin Parr""","[26, 33]","Eternally bitter, cynical but never toxic and always with a hint of beautiful humanity, Nicole Holofcener is always a distaff alternative to Woody Allen's neurotic obsessions. Her works, deemed as 'vagina movies', are no less assured, and even surpass the works of her male counterparts; whereas, Allen's works nowadays are consistent in their inconsistency, Holofcener's works organically evolve to correspond to the reality that we live in, and, as response, the people that we become. Her first film, ""Walking and Talking"" back in 1996 is a thoroughly charming and affable film, with concepts of loneliness, abandonment and feeling lost explored, but the pervading anxiety and bitter humour that have long since been her staple from her second film thereafter, are kept at bay, for most of the time. Her characters continually grow. Now, circa 21st century, and being caustic seems to be a natural trait. Still, Holofcener uses that to great effect; bitterness never overshadows, but merely used as a launching pad to explore the quiet beauty hidden amidst the toxic and the unpleasant.In her fourth film, ""Please Give"", she tackles capitalism, displaced guilt, physical appearances, infidelity and death amidst a chaotic, arbitrary world that is rather nihilistic, but only in a gentle, breezy, free-wheeling meaninglessness that does not feel like a discourse on an Ingmar Bergman's nothingness, but more akin to Eric Rohmer's affable meandering that is no less understatingly hurtful and quietly emotional.Set in rumbling New York City, Kathy (Catherine Keener) and Alex (Oliver Platt) own a furniture store, set by the couple's practice of buying furnitures at very low prices and put them up with high markups. They are also waiting for the next door neighbour, a bitter, ungrateful old hag, Andra (Ann Guilbert), to die so that they could expand the size of their apartment. In the meantime, Andra's two nieces, Rebecca (Rebecca hall) and Mary (Amanda Peet) are dealing with their own problems: Rebecca is a busybody, working as a mammogram technician, keeping romance and personal life at bay; and Mary, a skin consultant, who continually stalks her ex-boyfriend's new girlfriend, and at some point, ends up having an affair with Alex. Amidst all this, Kathy and Alex's daughter, is dealing with her bodily appearance: her weight and acne problems.""Please Give"" sets up this multi-strand storylines via Holofcener's typical free floating, stream-of-conscious fashion that negates the structural device of storytelling, and opts for a presentation of a slice-of-life. The camera adopts an objective point of view, even revelling in arbitrary scenes that seem to never amount to anything, but somehow feel organic to the whole film. And even with this objectivity, it is never unsympathetic, even if most of these characters are unlikeable and even bordering on being nasty.Indeed, sometimes it's better to start off with the negative to accentuate the positive. With this, Holofcener is able to explore the moral implications of living in a capitalistic society. To what extent does one go to successfully carve out a comfortable life for one's self? Kate's obsession with giving out a lot money to the poor seems irrational, but really an ascetic ideal that she churns out for herself, to get rid of her guilt for her wrong choices in life. It is an inherently self-destructive act, prompted by shame, insecurities, selfishness and self-absorption, that is merely offset by the outer appearance of the act: it is an ostentatiously kind and generous act of giving. Kate's asceticism mirrors Mary's affinity for stalking an unsuspecting woman and having an illicit affair with Alex: the lengths to which one goes to, just to find a name for an undefinable feeling of loneliness and pain. At least, with the daughter, it is called being chubby, and acne-ridden. Wait until she gets older.All of these characters, just like in any other Holofcener films, feel insignificant; they struggle living in a hostile, unlovable world, and they respond to themselves and to each other in equally hostile, unlovable manner; but there is quiet beauty that is transcendental when one watches Holofcener deviates further more into seemingly random scenes; like seeing an anonymous couple looking for the right furniture in Kathy's store, or Rebecca walking the dog with Kathy's daughter. Like watching an unexpected petal falling off a dying flower, Holofcener's images are delicately evocative, and revelatory in their quietness.""Please Give"" is a very sharp, brutally honest work that is all at once, hilarious, acidic, and always strangely moving, without any need for emotional manipulation or ostentatious dramatic histrionics. See this, not merely as an entertainment, but as an opportunity to bask in its many quiet moments of emotional insights that neither praise nor condemn its characters. Besides, there is Catherine Keener, Holofcener's beloved muse, one of the very few actresses nowadays who can effectively kill someone with merely delivering a cutting remark, and simultaneously still break a heart with pathos for her character.",5,Pretty Generous in its Many Emotional Insights,1279497600,"07 19, 2010",2010,5139,"['Eternally', 'bitter', 'cynical', 'never', 'toxic', 'always',

This is one of those ""small"" independent films which don't make a lot of noise when they open in major theatre markets - look at the cast list, which has no A-list personalities - but finds a home on home video where, devoid of cell phone chats behind you - or the person texting next to you - the film viewer can immerse themselves in the film. (This is the kind of film that the Weinstein Company released until recently. Now Sony Picture Classics is picking up the ball.)  It came and went briefly in my city but I heard ""good vibes"" about it and wanted to see for myself. I was truly engaged for the brief 90 minute running time. I was only familiar with actor Oliver Platt (who still reminds me of Oliver Hardy (of Laurel and...), a role he played early in his career. The rest of the cast was new to me - which is good because I had no preconceived notions. And I hadn't see the previous films of Director Nicole Holofcener, but now plan to check them out.This is definitely a film that will appeal more to those who live in the major urban cities like New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. It has that ""feel"" and because renting in a high rise apartment is a major part of the plot (described in detail by others), it is easier to relate to. Those of us who have dabbled in selling collectibles on Ebay or the internet will also find this film worth watching and will be drawn in by the ""buy low, sell high"" subplot as well.As a relationship film about hidden passions and honesty it is also engaging. Its that kind of multifaceted film. Don't dig too deep into it. Just watch it and enjoy it. I did!There are the usual ""behind the scenes"" and ""outtakes"" plus a Q&A; with the Director as bonuses.

1339233,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B003EYVXQ4,Turfseer,"[2, 4]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Perhaps the most interesting observations in 'Please Give', Nicole Holofcener's new 'dramedy' about two families that live next to each other in a New York City apartment building, are not the main characters' personalities but rather their professions. Cathy (Elizabeth Keener) and Alex (Oliver Platt) run a second hand furniture store, usually obtaining merchandise from home owners who have recently lost a family member. Then there are the two sisters who live next door: Rebecca (Rebecca Hall) who is a radiologist assistant at a mammography clinic and Mary (Amanda Peat) who does facials at a salon.'Please Give' begins with unsettling closeups of womens' breasts at the mammography clinic. When viewing these images at the beginning of the film, one wonders if this is going to be one of those intense dramas about people afflicted with cancer. We soon discover, however, that 'Please Give' focuses much more on inconsequential concerns.The title refers to Cathy's overly altruistic nature. This is a woman who feels compelled to give money to homeless people whenever she bumps into them on the street. Her teenage daughter, Abby, is appalled by her mother's misguided altruism; in one scene, Abby takes a $20 bill away from her mother, who then pulls out a $5 bill, handing it to the homeless person, apologizing anyway that she doesn't have more to give him. Later, Cathy tries to land a job doing volunteer work, working with children with special needs; unfortunately, she becomes overly emotional about the nature of the handicapped kids' situation, which interferes with her ability to assist them on a practical basis.One of the main story lines involves Cathy and Alex purchasing their next door neighbor's apartment. The apartment will only be for sale when Rebecca and Mary's grandmother, Andra, kicks the bucket. She's a petulant old woman with a foul mouth. Additional conflict pops up between Rebecca who disapproves of the way her sister Mary treats their grandmother (Mary perhaps being the film's antagonist, due to her cold-hearted disposition).Little much else happens plot-wise in 'Please Give': Alex has a brief affair with Mary; Cathy argues about Abby's desire to purchase some expensive designer jeans; Rebecca begins going out with the grandson of one of the patients at the clinic; Cathy struggles with guilt feelings over the furniture markups and Andra finally does indeed kick the bucket.All's well that end's well when Cathy and Alex seem to resolve their differences with their teenage daughter and agree to purchase those expensive jeans she's been craving all along.Ultimately, Holofcener fails to develop her characters into full-realized human beings. Each has a quirky aspect to their personality and are placed in situations that I would hardly call 'riveting'. 'Please Give' is incredibly slow-paced and the laughs are few and far between. This film would have been much more compelling if the stakes were somehow razed and we were treated to a plot replete with all kinds of unusual twists and turns.",2,Virtually plotless chronicle of quirky Big Apple next door neighbors,1297555200,"02 13, 2011",2011,3086,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***Perhaps', 'most', 'interesting', 'observations', ""'Please"", 'Give', 'Nicole', 'Holofcener', 'new', ""'dramedy"", 'two', 'families', 'live', 'next', 'other', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'apartment', 'building', 'are', 'not', 'main', 'characters', 'personalities', 'rather', 'professions', 'Cathy', 'Elizabeth', 'Keener', 'Alex', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'run', 'second', 'hand', 'furniture', 'store', 'usually', 'obtaining', 'merchandise', 'home', 'owners', 'who', 'have', 'recently', 'lost', 'family', 'member', 'Then', 'are', 'two', 'sisters', 'who', 'live', 'next', 'door', 'Rebecca', 'Rebecca', 'Hall', 'who', 'radiologist', 'assistant', 'mammography', 'clinic', 'Mary', 'Amanda', 'Peat', 'who', 'facials', 'salon', 'Give', 'begins', 'unsettling', 'closeups', 'womens', 'breasts', 'mammography', 'clinic', 'When', 'viewing', 'images', 'beginning', 'film', 'one', 'wonders', 'going', 'be', 'one', 'intense', 'dramas', 'people', 'afflicted', 'cancer', 'soon', 'discover', 'however', ""'Please"", 'Give', 'focuses', 'much', 'more', 'inconsequential', 'concerns.The', 'title', 'refers', 'Cathy', 'overly', 'altruistic', 'nature', 'woman', 'who', 'compelled', 'give', 'money', 'homeless', 'people', 'whenever', 'bumps', 'street', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Abby', 'appalled', 'mother', 'misguided', 'altruism', 'one', 'scene', 'Abby', '20', 'bill', 'away', 'mother', 'who', 'then', 'out', '5', 'bill', 'handing', 'homeless', 'person', 'apologizing', 'anyway', ""n't"", 'have', 'more', 'give', 'Later', 'Cathy', 'land', 'job', 'doing', 'volunteer', 'work', 'working', 'children', 'special', 'needs', 'unfortunately', 'overly', 'emotional', 'nature', 'handicapped', 'kids', 'situation', 'ability', 'assist', 'practical', 'basis.One', 'main', 'story', 'lines', 'Cathy', 'Alex', 'purchasing', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'apartment', 'apartment', 'will', 'only', 'be', 'sale', 'when', 'Rebecca', 'Mary', 'grandmother', 'Andra', 'bucket', 'petulant', 'old', 'woman', 'foul', 'mouth', 'Additional', 'conflict', 'up', 'Rebecca', 'who', 'way', 'sister', 'Mary', 'grandmother', 'Mary', 'perhaps', 'being', 'film', 'antagonist', 'due', 'cold-hearted', 'disposition', '.Little', 'much', 'else', 'plot-wise', ""'Please"", 'Give', 'Alex', 'brief', 'affair', 'Mary', 'Cathy', 'Abby', 'desire', 'purchase', 'expensive', 'designer', 'jeans', 'Rebecca', 'going', 'out', 'grandson', 'one', 'patients', 'clinic', 'Cathy', 'guilt', 'feelings', 'furniture', 'markups', 'Andra', 'finally', 'indeed', 'kick', 'bucket.All', 'well', 'end', 'well', 'when', 'Cathy', 'Alex', 'seem', 'resolve', 'differences', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'agree', 'purchase', 'expensive', 'jeans', 'been', 'craving', 'along.Ultimately', 'Holofcener', 'develop', 'characters', 'full-realized', 'human', 'beings', 'quirky', 'aspect', 'personality', 'are', 'placed', 'situations', 'would', 'hardly', 'call', ""'riveting"", ""'Please"", 'Give', 'incredibly', 'slow-paced', 'laughs', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'compelling', 'stakes', 'were', 'somehow', 'razed', 'were', 'treated', 'plot', 'replete', 'kinds', 'unusual', 'twists', 'turns']",N/A
