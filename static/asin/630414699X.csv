404060,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,630414699X,David Baldwin,"[5, 7]","Before I start my review I'd like to say that Timothy Bottoms sure looks like George W. Bush(ironically, his character in the film is named George).  I don't know if this film is trying to be a homage or a parody of 1950's sci-fi films.  Either way, it does not succeed.  To the films detriment, the make-up and special effects aren't really that good considering that they were designed by Oscar winners John Dykstra and Stan Winston.  The film doesn't move that well;it just kind of lumbers along.  The adult actors are adequate but not outstanding.  Louise Fletcher seems to be channeling Nurse Ratched in her role as the mean biology teacher.  Bud Cort(of ""Harold and Maude"" fame) has a strange little role as a scientist.  What keeps this film grounded is the performance of young Hunter Carson(real-life son of co-star Karen Black) as David Gardner, the kid who sees all the strange goings on but is having a hard time convincing the adults.  He makes the film watchable.  If not for him I would rate this film two stars instead of three.",3,Penny for Your Thoughts,1098662400,"10 25, 2004",2004,1044,"['start', 'review', ""'d"", 'like', 'say', 'Timothy', 'Bottoms', 'sure', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'ironically', 'character', 'film', 'named', 'George', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'film', 'trying', 'be', 'homage', 'parody', '1950', 'sci-fi', 'films', 'way', 'not', 'succeed', 'films', 'detriment', 'make-up', 'special', 'effects', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'that', 'good', 'considering', 'were', 'designed', 'Oscar', 'winners', 'John', 'Dykstra', 'Stan', 'Winston', 'film', ""n't"", 'move', 'that', 'well', 'just', 'kind', 'lumbers', 'adult', 'actors', 'are', 'adequate', 'not', 'outstanding', 'Louise', 'Fletcher', 'be', 'channeling', 'Nurse', 'Ratched', 'role', 'mean', 'biology', 'teacher', 'Bud', 'Cort', 'Harold', 'Maude', 'fame', 'strange', 'little', 'role', 'scientist', 'What', 'film', 'grounded', 'performance', 'young', 'Hunter', 'Carson', 'real-life', 'son', 'co-star', 'Karen', 'Black', 'David', 'Gardner', 'kid', 'who', 'strange', 'goings', 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'convincing', 'adults', 'film', 'watchable', 'not', 'would', 'rate', 'film', 'two', 'stars', 'instead', 'three']",Invaders From Mars VHS

404062,A7RM685PHBK20,630414699X,Eric,"[4, 8]","Famed horror director Tobe Hooper should consider himself lucky that he had the chance to direct big budgeted sci-fi/horror movies, three of them as a matter of fact (Which is entirely unfair since George Romero never had  the chance to work on the big budget he deserved).  To refresh your memory,  the first was Poltergeist which was critically acclaimed, though I have to  say Hooper basically copied Spielberg's directing style in that film.  The  second was Lifeforce, a decent and entertaining sci-fi thriller about space  vampires trying to take over the Earth.  That film was a flop due to the  fact it didn't bring back even half its budget.  The film itself cost 28  million dollars which is equivalent to well over 70 million these days.  To  give you an even bigger sense of how expensive it was, Aliens (which came  out the year before Lifeforce), cost 19 million dollars to make.  The third  film was Invaders From Mars, a film that is absolutely terrible.  In what  had a promising premise, the film ruins it with the overuse of special  effects that are also extremely cheesy-looking.  Add along with that some  bad acting and equally terrible dialogue and you have a film that has the  quality of Mystery Science Theater 3000.  If you want to watch an  entertaining sci-fi horror film from Tobe Hooper, go with Lifeforce.  Otherwise, leave well enough alone.",1,Tobe Hooper really wasted his chance,959558400,"05 29, 2000",2000,1375,"['Famed', 'horror', 'director', 'Tobe', 'Hooper', 'should', 'consider', 'lucky', 'had', 'chance', 'direct', 'big', 'budgeted', 'sci-fi/horror', 'movies', 'three', 'matter', 'fact', 'Which', 'entirely', 'unfair', 'George', 'Romero', 'never', 'had', 'chance', 'work', 'big', 'budget', 'deserved', 'refresh', 'memory', 'first', 'was', 'Poltergeist', 'was', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'have', 'say', 'Hooper', 'basically', 'copied', 'Spielberg', 'directing', 'style', 'film', 'second', 'was', 'Lifeforce', 'decent', 'entertaining', 'sci-fi', 'thriller', 'space', 'vampires', 'trying', 'take', 'over', 'Earth', 'film', 'was', 'flop', 'due', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'bring', 'back', 'even', 'budget', 'film', 'cost', '28', 'million', 'dollars', 'equivalent', 'well', '70', 'million', 'days', 'give', 'even', 'bigger', 'sense', 'how', 'expensive', 'was', 'Aliens', 'came', 'out', 'year', 'Lifeforce', '19', 'million', 'dollars', 'make', 'third', 'film', 'was', 'Invaders', 'Mars', 'film', 'absolutely', 'terrible', 'what', 'had', 'promising', 'premise', 'film', 'overuse', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'also', 'extremely', 'cheesy-looking', 'Add', 'bad', 'acting', 'equally', 'terrible', 'dialogue', 'have', 'film', 'quality', 'Mystery', 'Science', 'Theater', '3000', 'want', 'watch', 'entertaining', 'sci-fi', 'horror', 'film', 'Tobe', 'Hooper', 'go', 'Lifeforce', 'Otherwise', 'leave', 'well', 'enough', 'alone']",Invaders From Mars VHS
404063,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,630414699X,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[10, 12]","The original 1953 INVADERS FROM MARS is a cult classic, appreciated for both its influence on later similar films and the fact that it reads as hilariously corny by today standards.  But this 1986 remake--in spite of a big budget, several very talented actors, and a deliberately campy script--is unlikely to inspire the same sort of loyalty, and it was universally condemned by critics and audiences alike when first released.That said, the film really isn't as bad as you may have heard.  The plot follows the original version quite closely: the imaginative young son (Hunter Carson) of two loving parents (Timothy Bottom and Laraine Newman) catches sight of a UFO as it lands beyond the hill behind his house--and when his father goes out to investigate he returns... well... different.  When his mother and his evil school teacher (Louise Fletcher) follow suit, he turns to the school nurse (Karen Black), and together the two alert the local military to the strange goings-on.The cast is really quite good.  Although the script gives her little to do beyond run around screaming, Karen Black has a unique screen presence--and it is as evident here as it is in her more celebrated films.  Her real life son, Hunter Carson, does the honors as the child lead, and aquits himself very well.  But the most memorable performances are from Laraine Newman, Timothy Bottom, and Louise Fletcher, who are transformed by the UFO and sent abroad to do the aliens' evil will.  Fletcher is particularly enjoyable, wringing the most from her role as every child's nightmare school teacher.  The special effects have dated and seem remarkably derrivative, a mix of STAR WARS and ALIEN, but they too are entertaining in their own way, and although it isn't always successful the script has enough campy humor (much of it in reference to the original) to give you an occasional hoot.As pure fluff, the 1986 INVADERS FROM MARS works very well, and kids ten and up are likely to find it extremely entertaining.  Still, I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way for this particular movie.  It is mindlessly entertaining, but I don't think it is a film to which many viewers will care to return.",3,Silly Fun,1041379200,"01 1, 2003",2003,2175,"['original', '1953', 'INVADERS', 'FROM', 'MARS', 'cult', 'classic', 'appreciated', 'influence', 'later', 'similar', 'films', 'fact', 'hilariously', 'corny', 'today', 'standards', '1986', 'remake', 'spite', 'big', 'budget', 'several', 'very', 'talented', 'actors', 'deliberately', 'campy', 'script', 'unlikely', 'inspire', 'same', 'sort', 'loyalty', 'was', 'universally', 'condemned', 'critics', 'audiences', 'alike', 'when', 'first', 'released.That', 'said', 'film', 'really', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'may', 'have', 'heard', 'plot', 'original', 'version', 'quite', 'closely', 'imaginative', 'young', 'son', 'Hunter', 'Carson', 'two', 'loving', 'parents', 'Timothy', 'Bottom', 'Laraine', 'Newman', 'catches', 'sight', 'UFO', 'hill', 'house', 'when', 'father', 'out', 'investigate', 'well', 'different', 'When', 'mother', 'evil', 'school', 'teacher', 'Louise', 'Fletcher', 'follow', 'suit', 'school', 'nurse', 'Karen', 'Black', 'together', 'two', 'alert', 'local', 'military', 'strange', 'goings-on.The', 'cast', 'really', 'quite', 'good', 'script', 'little', 'do', 'run', 'screaming', 'Karen', 'Black', 'unique', 'screen', 'presence', 'evident', 'here', 'more', 'celebrated', 'films', 'real', 'life', 'son', 'Hunter', 'Carson', 'honors', 'child', 'lead', 'very', 'well', 'most', 'memorable', 'performances', 'are', 'Laraine', 'Newman', 'Timothy', 'Bottom', 'Louise', 'Fletcher', 'who', 'are', 'transformed', 'UFO', 'sent', 'abroad', 'do', 'aliens', 'evil', 'will', 'Fletcher', 'particularly', 'enjoyable', 'wringing', 'most', 'role', 'child', 'nightmare', 'school', 'teacher', 'special', 'effects', 'have', 'dated', 'seem', 'remarkably', 'derrivative', 'mix', 'STAR', 'WARS', 'ALIEN', 'too', 'are', 'entertaining', 'own', 'way', ""n't"", 'always', 'successful', 'script', 'enough', 'campy', 'humor', 'much', 'reference', 'original', 'give', 'occasional', 'hoot.As', 'pure', 'fluff', '1986', 'INVADERS', 'FROM', 'MARS', 'very', 'well', 'kids', 'ten', 'up', 'are', 'likely', 'find', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'Still', 'would', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'go', 'way', 'particular', 'movie', 'mindlessly', 'entertaining', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'many', 'viewers', 'will', 'care', 'return']",Invaders From Mars VHS

This was my first movie by Tobe Hooper, Poltergeist was better than this, but it's still enjoyable for me. The cast maybe unknown to some, but I know some of them-esp. Timothy Bottoms as the father, remember Land of Faraway, the King? In this though, he's not nearly as nice, or gentle, but he plays his part well. Karen Black, who plays the school nurse, is apparently best known for charecter roles, in particular horror and sci-fi. Still, she does a nice job. Then there's Louise Fletcher, whose role as a menacing teacher, probably couldn't do better, although maybe Helen Mirren could've, but she might've refused the frog-eating scene.

404078,A96K1ZGW56S2I,630414699X,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[2, 2]","Sooner or later, someone in Hollywood will remake not only every classic film that has been ever made, but every half-way decent film, too.  The original 1953 INVADERS FROM MARS really isn't a great piece of sci-fi, but it is regarded as a classic because of some of the magnificent images in the movie, e.g. the lights behind the hill with the fence and people being sucked by a swirling vortex into the ground.  In the early 1980s, Tobe Hooper (of THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE fame) set out to remake his favorite movie of all time, INVADERS FROM MARS.The movie revolves around David Gardner (Hunter Carson).  David loves astronomy.  One night during a freak thunderstorm he thinks he sees a spaceship land not far from their house, just over a hill.  He tells his parents about it, but they think he was just dreaming.  However, David's father, George (Timothy Bottoms), investigates and when he returns in the morning he is a different man.  He tells David he was right, that there was something just over the hill but before he gets a chance to show David, the school bus arrives to take David to school.  Later, David's mother and school teacher start acting just as strange as his dad and David suspects that aliens are involved.  After he catches his teacher secretly eating during a meal, he knows aliens have invaded and are taking over people's bodies.  He meets with the only person he feels he can trust, the school nurse, Linda Magnussen (Karen Black).  Initially she doesn't believe David, but does believe something is going wrong in his life.  But after seeing the truth for herself, she sets out with David for a nearby military base for help.When this version of INVADERS FROM MARS was initially released, it was panned by critics and bombed at the box office.  People kept talking about how good the original was and that this movie just didn't live up to it.  I don't think any of those people ever saw the original movie because other than some amazing visuals and some fine acting by Jimmy Hunt as David Maclean, the 1953 INVADERS FROM MARS isn't that great of a movie. There's really only one alien in that movie and the rest are a bunch of Martian/human hybrid mutants that are referred to as ""moo-tants"" (instead of  ""mew-tunts) and are portrayed by people in green makeup and rubber suits running around with their hands in a robotic positions.  The budget was so low that the interior of the cave in the original was made from blown-up condoms that were painted over. It's true that watching the original movie now, there is a certain charm to it that initial viewers of the remake might not have felt upon watching the remake.Still, you can tell that Tobe Hooper was a major fan of the original movie because his version carefully replicates the best parts of that movie and sometimes the worst (including the terrible ending).  However, he updates the movie with a more modern feel and also leaves his own special touch in a few places.  The result is a fun little piece of sci-fi horror that is overall actually just as good if not a tad better than the original.  It's a mix of humor, sci-fi action, and horror that at times borders on campy, but is blended fairly well.  Also, watching the movie over 20 years after its initial release, the remake has a certain charm to it to, though of a far different kind than the original.That's not to say INVADERS FROM MARS is a great movie, because it's not.  However, it is a fun one.  It's a movie that people would probably enjoy watching on a rainy day or late at night when they can't get to sleep.The extras on the DVD include an original publicity featurette, a sci-fi featurette, and the original theatrical trailer.",4,It's Really Just As Good If Not Better Than the Original,1275091200,"05 29, 2010",2010,3697,"['Sooner', 'later', 'someone', 'Hollywood', 'will', 'remake', 'not', 'only', 'classic', 'film', 'been', 'ever', 'made', 'half-way', 'decent', 'film', 'too', 'original', '1953', 'INVADERS', 'FROM', 'MARS', 'really', ""n't"", 'great', 'piece', 'sci-fi', 'regarded', 'classic', 'magnificent', 'images', 'movie', 'e.g', 'lights', 'hill', 'fence', 'people', 'being', 'sucked', 'swirling', 'vortex', 'ground', 'early', '1980s', 'Tobe', 'Hooper', 'THE', 'TEXAS', 'CHAINSAW', 'MASSACRE', 'fame', 'set', 'out', 'remake', 'favorite', 'movie', 'time', 'INVADERS', 'FROM', 'MARS.The', 'movie', 'around', 'David', 'Gardner', 'Hunter', 'Carson', 'David', 'astronomy', 'One', 'night', 'freak', 'thunderstorm', 'spaceship', 'land', 'not', 'far', 'house', 'just', 'hill', 'parents', 'think', 'was', 'just', 'dreaming', 'However', 'David', 'father', 'George', 'Timothy', 'Bottoms', 'investigates', 'when', 'morning', 'different', 'man', 'David', 'was', 'right', 'was', 'something', 'just', 'hill', 'chance', 'show', 'David', 'school', 'bus', 'take', 'David', 'school', 'Later', 'David', 'mother', 'school', 'teacher', 'start', 'acting', 'just', 'as', 'strange', 'dad', 'David', 'aliens', 'are', 'involved', 'teacher', 'secretly', 'eating', 'meal', 'aliens', 'have', 'invaded', 'are', 'taking', 'over', 'people', 'bodies', 'only', 'person', 'can', 'trust', 'school', 'nurse', 'Linda', 'Magnussen', 'Karen', 'Black', 'Initially', ""n't"", 'believe', 'David', 'believe', 'something', 'going', 'wrong', 'life', 'seeing', 'truth', 'herself', 'out', 'David', 'nearby', 'military', 'base', 'help.When', 'version', 'INVADERS', 'FROM', 'MARS', 'was', 'initially', 'released', 'was', 'panned', 'critics', 'bombed', 'box', 'office', 'People', 'kept', 'talking', 'how', 'good', 'original', 'was', 'movie', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'people', 'ever', 'saw', 'original', 'movie', 'other', 'amazing', 'visuals', 'fine', 'acting', 'Jimmy', 'Hunt', 'David', 'Maclean', '1953', 'INVADERS', 'FROM', 'MARS', ""n't"", 'great', 'movie', 'really', 'only', 'one', 'alien', 'movie', 'rest', 'are', 'bunch', 'Martian/human', 'hybrid', 'mutants', 'are', 'referred', 'moo-tants', 'instead', 'mew-tunts', 'are', 'portrayed', 'people', 'green', 'makeup', 'rubber', 'suits', 'running', 'around', 'hands', 'robotic', 'positions', 'budget', 'was', 'so', 'low', 'interior', 'cave', 'original', 'was', 'made', 'blown-up', 'condoms', 'were', 'painted', 'true', 'watching', 'original', 'movie', 'now', 'certain', 'charm', 'initial', 'viewers', 'remake', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'felt', 'watching', 'remake.Still', 'can', 'tell', 'Tobe', 'Hooper', 'was', 'major', 'fan', 'original', 'movie', 'version', 'carefully', 'best', 'parts', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'worst', 'including', 'terrible', 'ending', 'However', 'movie', 'more', 'modern', 'feel', 'also', 'own', 'special', 'touch', 'few', 'places', 'result', 'fun', 'little', 'piece', 'sci-fi', 'horror', 'overall', 'actually', 'just', 'good', 'not', 'tad', 'better', 'original', 'mix', 'humor', 'sci-fi', 'action', 'horror', 'times', 'borders', 'campy', 'blended', 'fairly', 'well', 'Also', 'watching', 'movie', '20', 'years', 'initial', 'release', 'remake', 'certain', 'charm', 'far', 'different', 'kind', 'original.That', 'not', 'say', 'INVADERS', 'FROM', 'MARS', 'great', 'movie', 'not', 'However', 'fun', 'one', 'movie', 'people', 'would', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'rainy', 'day', 'late', 'night', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'sleep.The', 'extras', 'DVD', 'include', 'original', 'publicity', 'featurette', 'sci-fi', 'featurette', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer']",Invaders From Mars VHS
