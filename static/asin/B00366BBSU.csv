You could not help but wish they could get back together but at the same time, you know he is getting more than he deserves.  Most women couldn't be that nice.  The only really horrible part was the way it ended.  I assume it was the last show of the season and haven't heard about there being anymore.  It left us with a cliff hanger and we want more!!!!!!",5,Very funny - hated the way it ended.,1276387200,"06 13, 2010",2010,454,"['very', 'funny', 'show', 'was', 'difficult', 'see', 'Theo', 'Huxtable', 'cast', 'bad', 'guy', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'wish', 'could', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'same', 'time', 'know', 'getting', 'more', 'Most', 'women', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'nice', 'only', 'really', 'horrible', 'part', 'was', 'way', 'ended', 'assume', 'was', 'last', 'show', 'season', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'there', 'being', 'anymore', 'left', 'cliff', 'hanger', 'want', 'more']",Sherri: Season 1
1327228,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B00366BBSU,Haunted Flower,"[4, 4]","Sherri: The Complete Season One13 Episodes on 2 Discs, Widescreen Edition (2010)Actress, comedienne, author, and co-host of The View, Sherri Shepherd stars as Sherri Robinson, a single mother who works as a paralegal still attempting to follow her dream as an actress. (Obviously, this role must be SUCH a stretch for her.) Sherri has a six year old son and is separated from her husband who cheated on her with a white girl who works at Quizno's and got her pregnant. Most of Sherri's conflicts are with her son, her ex, her career, and dating new guys.I wish sitcoms could just be judged on how funny they actually are. Laugh-tracks still seem unusual and fake. When it doesn't rely on sentimental moments and just stays in the comedy mode, Sherri is actually pretty funny. Her delivery is enthusiastic and while the story lines are very predictable each episode, her fresh expressions help keep the show going. Her rant on the ""cow giving away the milk for free"" was one of the most hilarious moments.It is uncertain how many of these episodes are based in some small scale on things that actually happened in Sherri's life, but whether or not the viewer has had any of her situations, they still can be pretty funny. She is easy to empathize with and who doesn't like a mad black woman going off about her ex-husband? This is one of the funnier sitcoms this year and it is easy to get drawn in with the characters and situations.Theo from the Cosby Show (Malcolm-Jamal Warner) makes an appearance as Sherri's ex who got a white girl Quizno's employee pregnant when he cheated on her. Her father is James Avery, the dad from ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"" and he shows up to give her comfort and tough love advice when she has trouble keeping her divorcee bitterness at bay. Her friends at work are all distinctive, Celia's a sassy reverend's wife (Tammy Townsend), Angie's a blond from Brooklyn (Elizabeth Regen), and Summer's a quirky nerdy single lady boss (Kali Rocha). Michael Boatman from ""Spin City"" is one of Sherri's potential suitors as her son, Bo's (Brandon Khalil) pediatrician. Bo himself is a pretty low energy personality, could've used a little more pep in their casting.Final verdict is that this show has a lot of merit and is worth a look, especially if you are a mother, a divorcee, an actress/comedian, black, or a woman and if you are a combination of all of these, you should definitely buy this season one set. If you are a fan of Sherri's and watch ""The View"", you'll love this. There is no verdict yet that I could find on whether a second season will be made so you should check out the DVD set to see it. The season ends with a cliffhanger so there has been a bit of online message board requesting for another one.DVD Extras:There are 8 Webisodes including stand-up about about family, friends, kids, dating, and finding the right guy. Sherri does her version of what Jerry Seinfeld used to do for his show but she only does stand-up in Season One of her show in two episodes. It's funny, it's fresh, and it is easy to relate to without having to get shock value, swearing, or sex involved. The bits she does on friends playing games together is hilariously accurate. It seems like these may have original been recorded to go on the very beginning of the show or the credits but was not included in the show.",3,Sherri is funnier than expected but the supporting cast can be dull at times,1271376000,"04 16, 2010",2010,3340,"['Sherri', 'Complete', 'Season', 'One13', 'Episodes', '2', 'Discs', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', '2010', 'Actress', 'comedienne', 'author', 'co-host', 'View', 'Sherri', 'Shepherd', 'Sherri', 'Robinson', 'single', 'mother', 'who', 'paralegal', 'still', 'attempting', 'follow', 'dream', 'actress', 'Obviously', 'role', 'must', 'be', 'stretch', 'Sherri', 'six', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'separated', 'husband', 'who', 'cheated', 'white', 'girl', 'who', 'Quizno', 'got', 'pregnant', 'Most', 'Sherri', 'conflicts', 'are', 'son', 'ex', 'career', 'dating', 'new', 'guys.I', 'wish', 'sitcoms', 'could', 'just', 'be', 'judged', 'how', 'funny', 'actually', 'are', 'Laugh-tracks', 'still', 'seem', 'unusual', 'fake', 'When', ""n't"", 'rely', 'sentimental', 'moments', 'just', 'stays', 'comedy', 'mode', 'Sherri', 'actually', 'pretty', 'funny', 'delivery', 'enthusiastic', 'story', 'lines', 'are', 'very', 'predictable', 'episode', 'fresh', 'expressions', 'help', 'keep', 'show', 'going', 'rant', 'cow', 'giving', 'away', 'milk', 'free', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'hilarious', 'moments.It', 'uncertain', 'how', 'many', 'episodes', 'are', 'based', 'small', 'scale', 'things', 'actually', 'happened', 'Sherri', 'life', 'not', 'viewer', 'had', 'situations', 'still', 'can', 'be', 'pretty', 'funny', 'easy', 'empathize', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'mad', 'black', 'woman', 'going', 'off', 'ex-husband', 'one', 'funnier', 'sitcoms', 'year', 'easy', 'get', 'drawn', 'characters', 'situations.Theo', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'Malcolm-Jamal', 'Warner', 'appearance', 'Sherri', 'ex', 'who', 'got', 'white', 'girl', 'Quizno', 'employee', 'pregnant', 'when', 'cheated', 'father', 'James', 'Avery', 'dad', 'Fresh', 'Prince', 'Bel-Air', 'up', 'give', 'comfort', 'tough', 'love', 'advice', 'when', 'trouble', 'keeping', 'divorcee', 'bitterness', 'bay', 'friends', 'work', 'are', 'distinctive', 'Celia', 'sassy', 'reverend', 'wife', 'Tammy', 'Townsend', 'Angie', 'blond', 'Brooklyn', 'Elizabeth', 'Regen', 'Summer', 'quirky', 'nerdy', 'single', 'lady', 'boss', 'Kali', 'Rocha', 'Michael', 'Boatman', 'Spin', 'City', 'one', 'Sherri', 'potential', 'suitors', 'son', 'Bo', 'Brandon', 'Khalil', 'pediatrician', 'Bo', 'pretty', 'low', 'energy', 'personality', 'could', ""'ve"", 'used', 'little', 'more', 'pep', 'casting.Final', 'verdict', 'show', 'lot', 'merit', 'look', 'especially', 'are', 'mother', 'divorcee', 'actress/comedian', 'black', 'woman', 'are', 'combination', 'should', 'definitely', 'buy', 'season', 'one', 'set', 'are', 'fan', 'Sherri', 'watch', 'View', ""'ll"", 'love', 'verdict', 'yet', 'could', 'find', 'second', 'season', 'will', 'be', 'made', 'should', 'check', 'out', 'DVD', 'set', 'see', 'season', 'cliffhanger', 'so', 'there', 'been', 'bit', 'online', 'message', 'board', 'requesting', 'one.DVD', 'Extras', 'are', '8', 'including', 'stand-up', 'family', 'friends', 'kids', 'dating', 'finding', 'right', 'guy', 'Sherri', 'version', 'what', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'used', 'do', 'show', 'only', 'stand-up', 'Season', 'One', 'show', 'two', 'episodes', 'funny', 'fresh', 'easy', 'relate', 'having', 'get', 'shock', 'value', 'swearing', 'sex', 'involved', 'bits', 'friends', 'playing', 'games', 'together', 'hilariously', 'accurate', 'may', 'have', 'original', 'been', 'recorded', 'go', 'very', 'beginning', 'show', 'credits', 'was', 'not', 'included', 'show']",Sherri: Season 1

1327230,A3W3OG4JJKFFTV,B00366BBSU,RetroRhythms,"[0, 0]","This is a very nicely done situation comedy focusing on character Sherri Robinson's efforts to balance her romantic and professional lives as a single mother. With a lively supporting cast including her co-workers Celia and Angie, as well as recurring appearances by her ex-husband and new dating interest, &#34;Sherri&#34; is a well-rounded, colorful program that effectively presents the challenges of modern-day living in an easily relatable, believable manner. Thankfully, the writers do not resort to fads or gimmicks to keep the show relevant to a particular audience. Each episode has a nice combination of humor and seriousness&#8212;although my favorite has to be &#34;Thanks-for-Not-for-Nothing-Giving&#34;!With a total of 13 episodes, we get a clear picture of the personality and priorities of Sherri and her friends and family. I believe that had this series continued, viewers would have gotten even more insight into the multi-dimensional framework of the characters' life stories. It's unfortunate that, for whatever reason, production stopped after only one season. Still, the short and sweet run of &#34;Sherri&#34; is one that I will continue to enjoy for its fun, intelligence, and well-rounded premise.",5,An Ideal Blend of Comedy and Reality,1397692800,"04 17, 2014",2014,1223,"['very', 'nicely', 'done', 'situation', 'comedy', 'focusing', 'character', 'Sherri', 'Robinson', 'efforts', 'balance', 'romantic', 'professional', 'lives', 'single', 'mother', 'lively', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'co-workers', 'Celia', 'Angie', 'as', 'well', 'recurring', 'appearances', 'ex-husband', 'new', 'dating', 'interest', '34', 'Sherri', '34', 'well-rounded', 'colorful', 'program', 'effectively', 'challenges', 'modern-day', 'living', 'easily', 'relatable', 'believable', 'manner', 'Thankfully', 'writers', 'do', 'not', 'resort', 'fads', 'gimmicks', 'keep', 'show', 'relevant', 'particular', 'audience', 'episode', 'nice', 'combination', 'humor', 'seriousness', '8212', 'favorite', 'be', '34', 'Thanks-for-Not-for-Nothing-Giving', '34', 'total', '13', 'episodes', 'get', 'clear', 'picture', 'personality', 'priorities', 'Sherri', 'friends', 'family', 'believe', 'had', 'series', 'continued', 'viewers', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'even', 'more', 'insight', 'multi-dimensional', 'framework', 'characters', 'life', 'stories', 'unfortunate', 'reason', 'production', 'stopped', 'only', 'one', 'season', 'Still', 'short', 'sweet', 'run', '34', 'Sherri', '34', 'one', 'will', 'continue', 'enjoy', 'fun', 'intelligence', 'well-rounded', 'premise']",Sherri: Season 1
1327231,A170QM825KM60W,B00366BBSU,rmcrae,"[10, 11]","I was excited for Sherri when she announced she was getting her own sitcom on Lifetime. The bulk of her tv career has been playing bit parts on well known shows like Friends, Everybody Loves Raymond, and Suddenly Susan. Not to mention her 4 year run on the hilarious Less Than Perfect. A show of her own was just what she deserved, but this one wasn't quite what I expected. It's based on her real life experiences with divorcing her husband who cheated on her with another woman and got her pregnant. Yeah, the premise is very similar to Reba, but it wasn't a rip-off. Far from it.I watched every episode and unfortunately my hopes for it fell after each one. Sherri's performance is excellent, funny, a bit sad, but determined to make life better for her and her young son Bo. The supporting characters were meh at best. James Avery (you might best remember him as Uncle Phil from The Fresh Prince of Bel Air) is funny, but only appears in 4 episodes. Wish there was more of him. Sherri's best friends and co-workers played by Tammy Townsend and Elizabeth Regen feel flat and one dimensional. Her snarky ""frenemy"" co-worker Summer (Kali Rocha) tries too hard to be funny and instead comes across as obnoxious. Malcolm Jamal Warner stars as Sherri's ex-husband and does the best with the material he's given, but it's not much. Most of the episodes are predictable and made me chuckle at best. Not much else. Sherri alone couldn't carry the weight of making the show work.It's unfortunate Sherri wasn't picked up for another season. With some radical changes and a better supporting cast it could've done better.
