847125,A1J1K3X8ZMB5WD,B0002VEX6Y,David Stager,"[127, 135]","I'm sure many of you that have navigated to this item are completely familiar with the program.  It's very important before you buy this item that you realize that it is not a kids video.  When this show was made in 1966, it was for kids.  I watched in on the ""Captain Satelitte"" (Bob March) program on KTVU San Francisco on weekdays, and it was also on KCRA Sacramento on Saturday mornings.  For anyone who was a kid in this era and was lucky enough to be age 8-12 in the mid-sixties, this DVD is for you.  If you are a parent and are buying a DVD for your kids that are in the 8-12 year old range today, forget it.  I have videotapes of all the episodes obtained at conventions and such and I can tell you from first-hand experience that modern kids don't like these.The target audience for this DVD is or should be the kids of the 60's who grew up with these characters and want to see the old comic books brought to life.  What these videos are, are the images from the actual silver-age Marvel comics of the 60's, crudly animated with over-the-top voice performances that bring the characters to life.  The animation itself is simply static images of comic book pages with an occasional animated arm or lip movement and a lot of zooms and pans.  They used the panels from the actual comic books to create the animation.The artwork is classic Jack Kirby, Don Heck, Steve Ditko, and Gene Colan stuff.  The voice actors did a great job with the dialogue and performed their lines in a way that must be considered the de-facto superhero standard because it was so comic-book like.At this writing, the item has not been released and whether it will be released at all is in question.  I'm hoping that someone associated with the project will read this review and take the time to present this item correctly into the marketplace.  Please do not release and package this as a kiddie video.This DVD set should be a ""scholarly"" reference set.  There should be notes identifying all the voice talent and the artists and writers who created the original comics.  The actual comic books and artists are easily recognizable in the episodes and so each episode should include the information about the comic where the story was first told.  Since the audience is the grown-up boomers, this is the best way to get them to buy.  That is what they want I guarantee it.There was no set broadcast episode order.  KTVU showed one segment at a time and you had to wait till the next day to get the next part of the story.  KCRA showed an entire three segment arc in one broadcast.  When I watched the show on KCRA, there was an opening theme song, ""The Merry Marvel Marching Society"" and end-title song and credits.  Each second and third segment had a re-cap of the story.As far as I know, the opening and closing titles have never been shown on TV again since the 1960's.  All you get now are the individual segments and usually the re-caps are edited out or the three segments are edited together into one.  Please don't cut this stuff up to make it ""easier to watch.""  Comic fans want the originals and don't like such ""improvments.""  So, if the elements are available, please give us the original ""Marvel Super Heroes"" program with opening and end titles and all the recaps.  Put the shows in comic-book chronological order and include as far as possible the creative credits in the liner notes.If a DVD box set of this type is produced, it will be purchased and hoarded by every collector and sold in every comic book shop in the land and at every convention every year forever.  The silver age comics are the gold standard and are still hoarded and fervently collected.  If you guys produce another kiddie video a few die-hards will buy it, but it won't have any legs and will go out of print for lack of sales just like all the other times these videos were released as kiddie video.  Learn the lesson and do it right.  I'm telling you who your customer is.  Will anyone listen to the customer?

847126,A205BECZCE6DAU,B0002VEX6Y,"Dennis M. Roy ""animation addict""","[10, 10]","No, these shows aren't ""animated"" in the traditional sense -- they are similar to the old CLUTCH CARGO tv show, an old-time radio drama combined with COMIC BOOK visuals.  I would be very disappointed if Disney (how the hell did THEY get the license to Marvel's animated product?  What about FOX? Or SONY?) did not release this, but seeing as how I just stumbled across this listing, and knowing the ""wisdom"" of DisneyCorp as I do, it wouldn't surprise me.  If anyone at Disney Video is reading this, please regard this as a plea to reconsider, and market this accordingly -- to middle-age comic book freaks, the kind that will gladly pay $50 a pop for Marvel's own hardcover reprints of their classic Silver Age comics (by and large, the very same stories featured in many of these 'toons).  If Disney was smart, they would package and market this thing to resemble the ""Marvel Masterworks"" hardcover collection of reprints.  Good quality remastered prints of the 'toons with some introductory remarks for each character's series by Stan Lee. Perhaps include some ""bonus"" materials, like a booklet containing original ads from the '60s Marvel comics hyping the series, along with various ""Bullpen Bulletin"" ITEM!s plugging the show.  Maybe even include a reproduction of the original Merry Marvel Marching Society fan club kits, just to make this a Silver Age Marvel fanboy's droolworthy, must-have double-bagged item.  Of course, it goes without saying that the shows should be arranged in chronological order, and the original comics' issue numbers and dates, on which the episodes were based, be noted in the liner notes.  Sadly, I dispair of it ever happening.  But as another commenter noted, if they did it right and marketed it right, it would sell forever in comic book shops across the land.

The purpose is to hopefully generate interest and to inform Marvels new masters at Disney that there is a market out here for this collection of animation.  Not only are there ""baby boomers"" who would be interested in owning these but every generation that has come after has devoted Marvel fans as well.  Fans devoted to these shows, Marvel fans who buy anything with their favorite character on it, and collectors who see value in nostalgia.  I know for certain that other generations are interested because as I write this I am watching the 1966 Captain America with my three year old son who loves, absolutely loves these shows.  My 19 year old nephew also watched these with my 45 year old brother when he was a child and would gladly pay for this set as well.  You see there are alot f us out here who would gladly pay for these.  There is a market for these as bootlegged DVD's and I will confess that I have all of them.  But even so I would wait in line and paytop dollar for an official release with some nice special features (I would even pay for it without special features).When I was a child I collected the MARVEL COMICS VIDEO LIBRARY (buying them used from video rental stores all over the country) and there were several episodes on these videos from the 1966 show.  This is how I was introduced to the show.  I in turn introduced them to my brother and nephews and now my sons.  Its just good entertainment for everyone.  When I was a child that is what Disney was all about but now its all about makin' a buck.  Well it seems to me that Disney could do both things by releasing these to the public.The only thing left to say is please, please Disney, relase these so that we might enjoy them with a claned up print and maybe some fun special features.

Admittedly the animation is very sparse but it maintains the feel of reading the comics all over again which is what Stan Lee intended (along with no doubt, a sparse budget!)...there were 5 Super Heroes highlighted in this series:1. Captain America, who has The Red Skull as his main antagonist.2. Hulk, who frequently battles The Leader.3. Iron Man and his early years foe, The Mandarin.4. Thor and his evil brother Loki.5. Sub-Mariner who was basically angry at everybody.The show aired in early 1966 and was cancelled after one season, but there were enough cartoons made to make this set worth while. Unlike the later seasons of the 60's Spiderman, when Ralph Bakshi turned the Web Slingers adventures into a drug induced bizzaro fest, the Marvel Super Hero series remained faithful to its source...Just a reminder that you will not be witnessing classic animation in these toons (no MTV Digital Spiderman here) but you will find much to enjoy.... whether you are a baby boomer 40 year old, a teen wanting to experience a more simpler time in comic book storytelling, or a comic book buff who wants to recount how the origins and early plots of these characters developed you will be pleased viewing the Marvel Super Hero Set...recommended without reservation....",4,A Nostalgic Trip Down Marvel Lane!,1102550400,"12 9, 2004",2004,1309,"['will', 'be', 'fun', 'series', 'watch', 'again', 'Admittedly', 'animation', 'very', 'sparse', 'feel', 'reading', 'comics', 'over', 'again', 'what', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'intended', 'doubt', 'sparse', 'budget', 'were', '5', 'Super', 'Heroes', 'highlighted', 'series:1', 'Captain', 'America', 'who', 'Red', 'Skull', 'main', 'antagonist.2', 'Hulk', 'who', 'frequently', 'Leader.3', 'Iron', 'Man', 'early', 'years', 'foe', 'Mandarin.4', 'Thor', 'evil', 'brother', 'Loki.5', 'Sub-Mariner', 'who', 'was', 'basically', 'angry', 'everybody.The', 'show', 'aired', 'early', '1966', 'was', 'cancelled', 'one', 'season', 'were', 'enough', 'cartoons', 'made', 'make', 'set', 'worth', 'later', 'seasons', '60', 'Spiderman', 'when', 'Ralph', 'Bakshi', 'turned', 'Web', 'Slingers', 'drug', 'induced', 'bizzaro', 'fest', 'Marvel', 'Super', 'Hero', 'series', 'remained', 'faithful', 'source', 'Just', 'reminder', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'witnessing', 'classic', 'animation', 'toons', 'MTV', 'Digital', 'Spiderman', 'here', 'will', 'find', 'much', 'enjoy', 'are', 'baby', 'boomer', '40', 'year', 'old', 'teen', 'wanting', 'experience', 'more', 'simpler', 'time', 'comic', 'book', 'storytelling', 'comic', 'book', 'buff', 'who', 'recount', 'how', 'origins', 'early', 'plots', 'characters', 'developed', 'will', 'be', 'pleased', 'viewing', 'Marvel', 'Super', 'Hero', 'Set', 'recommended', 'reservation']",The Marvel Superheroes '66 Collection

It ran on one of the TV stations in the Albany, NY market (I believe on Sunday mornings). I was born in '64 so I'm sure I was watching it in re-runs in the early 70s (as with the Fantastic Four cartoon from 1967). I would get up early just so I could see it and I absolutely loved seeing my favorite Marvel Super Heroes 'in action.' Captain America. Iron Man. Thor. Sub-Mariner. The Hulk. I can still sing most of the theme songs! It was great fun hearing the Iron Man theme song worked into the new Iron Man movie (played as an instrumental dance number as Tony Stark arrives at a party).I would spend the money without hesitation to have these 'terrible' old cartoons again for the sheer nostalgia of it. They work in two ways. Of course thousands of Marvel Comics fans who grew up in the 60s and 70s would jump at the chance to have them. But undoubtedly their young kids will enjoy them as well, even with the primitive animation.These cartoons would be great fun for me to see again so I sincerely ask that Disney get their act together and release them. It makes no sense to have the rights to them and leave them sitting in the vault.

847132,A1CDNTB7377YH2,B0002VEX6Y,Michael A. Newman,"[1, 1]","Growing up in the 1960's and being a big fan of the Marvel comics,one of the first ""must see"" television programs that debuted daily was The Marvel Super Heroes cartoons.  At first I was a little disappointed because the line-up did not include my two favorite titles, Spiderman and The Fantastic Four, but the show allowed me to gain an appreciation of two of the lesser Marvel titles, namely Submariner (pronounced in the cartoon submaroner and not like a ""submarine- r"") and The Mighty Thor.Each day of the week that had a different hero and each cartoon was taken directly from the comic book.  As a matter of fact they were so cheaply made that they took the actual artwork cels from the original comic art and made the characters mouths move.  To get a character to run they sometimes just moved the ""still"" character across the screen.  No matter, I hardly noticed as television cartoon animation during those days was no big deal.The cartoons each had their own theme songs.  I loved the theme songs, especially the song to the Merrry Marvel Marching Society.  I later learned that if you joined the MMS, Marvel sent you a record with the song along with a membership card.  Those records might be pretty valuable today, especially if you have one in good condition.The stories were better than most cartoon stories as they were taken exactly from the original classic comics.  One of my favorites was how Captain America was found floating in the ocean by the Avengers.  Apparently he and Bucky Barnes had been after Zemo (the villian with a mask glued to his head that maybe should have tried nail polish remover to get it off) had blown them up and Cap was frozen solid for over 20 years in suspended animation.Hulk had a funny voice and he was always yelling ""why?"" and ""you dare threaten Hulk?'  Tony Stark was very sophisticated and was always seeming to battle the Mandarin who had a Charlie Chan-like voice.  Captain America was off battling the Red Skull, while Thor seemed to be always fighting Mr. Hyde and The Cameleon.  Submariner also called Namor had his blue girlfriend, the Lady Dorma and the Hulk seemed to always be battling The Leader.By today's standards these cartoons are probably laughable (I even remember when Thor spoke with his father, Odin, the artwork of Odin would change three times in the same scene), but the great storylines make them enjoyable and a treasure to have!",5,Poor Animation But Great Tales,1284508800,"09 15, 2010",2010,2411,"['Growing', 'up', '1960', 'being', 'big', 'fan', 'Marvel', 'comics', 'one', 'first', 'must', 'see', 'television', 'programs', 'debuted', 'daily', 'was', 'Marvel', 'Super', 'Heroes', 'cartoons', 'first', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'line-up', 'did', 'not', 'include', 'two', 'favorite', 'titles', 'Spiderman', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'show', 'allowed', 'gain', 'appreciation', 'two', 'lesser', 'Marvel', 'titles', 'namely', 'Submariner', 'pronounced', 'cartoon', 'submaroner', 'not', 'submarine-', 'r', 'Mighty', 'Thor.Each', 'day', 'week', 'had', 'different', 'hero', 'cartoon', 'was', 'taken', 'directly', 'comic', 'book', 'matter', 'fact', 'were', 'so', 'cheaply', 'made', 'took', 'actual', 'artwork', 'cels', 'original', 'comic', 'art', 'made', 'characters', 'mouths', 'move', 'get', 'character', 'run', 'sometimes', 'just', 'moved', 'still', 'character', 'screen', 'matter', 'hardly', 'noticed', 'television', 'cartoon', 'animation', 'days', 'was', 'big', 'deal.The', 'cartoons', 'had', 'own', 'theme', 'songs', 'loved', 'theme', 'songs', 'especially', 'song', 'Merrry', 'Marvel', 'Marching', 'Society', 'later', 'learned', 'joined', 'MMS', 'Marvel', 'sent', 'record', 'song', 'membership', 'card', 'records', 'might', 'be', 'pretty', 'valuable', 'today', 'especially', 'have', 'one', 'good', 'condition.The', 'stories', 'were', 'better', 'most', 'cartoon', 'stories', 'were', 'taken', 'exactly', 'original', 'classic', 'comics', 'One', 'favorites', 'was', 'how', 'Captain', 'America', 'was', 'found', 'floating', 'ocean', 'Avengers', 'Apparently', 'Bucky', 'Barnes', 'had', 'been', 'Zemo', 'villian', 'mask', 'glued', 'head', 'maybe', 'should', 'have', 'tried', 'nail', 'polish', 'remover', 'get', 'off', 'had', 'blown', 'up', 'Cap', 'was', 'frozen', 'solid', '20', 'years', 'suspended', 'animation.Hulk', 'had', 'funny', 'voice', 'was', 'always', 'yelling', 'why', 'dare', 'threaten', 'Hulk', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'was', 'very', 'sophisticated', 'was', 'always', 'seeming', 'battle', 'Mandarin', 'who', 'had', 'Charlie', 'Chan-like', 'voice', 'Captain', 'America', 'was', 'off', 'battling', 'Red', 'Skull', 'Thor', 'seemed', 'be', 'always', 'fighting', 'Mr.', 'Hyde', 'Cameleon', 'Submariner', 'also', 'called', 'Namor', 'had', 'blue', 'girlfriend', 'Lady', 'Dorma', 'Hulk', 'seemed', 'always', 'be', 'battling', 'Leader.By', 'today', 'standards', 'cartoons', 'are', 'probably', 'laughable', 'even', 'remember', 'when', 'Thor', 'spoke', 'father', 'Odin', 'artwork', 'Odin', 'would', 'change', 'three', 'times', 'same', 'scene', 'great', 'storylines', 'make', 'enjoyable', 'treasure', 'have']",The Marvel Superheroes '66 Collection

I recognized instantly (you will too) that the animation was lousy. However, even lousy animation with Marvel stories was better than the cheesy Batman TV show. Looking back at these (I have some of these on video), my opinion hasn't changed. The transition from comic book to cartoon is rough (Thor's melodramatic speeches, for example) don't translate well. However, when we get Kirby artwork on the TV screen, now THAT counts for something, even if the ""animators"" just move a still shot across the screen.Who would like this? Those of us who still enjoy a nostalgic trip down memory lane and collectors of Silver Age comics. Young children who have not become jaded by modern animation techniques might be enthralled by the stories themselves.

I waited.... and waited..... and waited for the release. Then I started wondering what happened???? The I did a little research, and found out that there was a lawsuit where Marvel comics Sued Buena Vista Home Entertainment for their illegal use of a Spiderman poster/artwork which came from a deal Marvel had made with a seperate game company for the Spiderman Movie. Well, I can read between the lines here and assumed that the lawsuit put the kibosh on any plans Buena Vista had to release the Marvel '66 collection. Weather it was sour grapes or just a bad business vibe where Buena Vista felt that Marvel wouldn't allow any latitude to try to recoup if sales were soft, that seems to me to be the end of that dream. I sincerely doubt that anyone else will try to release this cartoon series (why is this again that Marvel can't just do this themselves?) Anyway, Major bummer!!!!!!!!

A different character was featured each day with a lineup of Captain America, Iron Man, The Hulk, Sub-mariner, and Thor.  This was not animation per se.  What Marvel did was use panel art from actual comics, transferred the are onto cels, and give them some slight animated movement.  They then added in voice actors and sound effects.  What it basically turned out to be was an animated comic book which was kind of cool because it brought a lot of classic silver age comics to life...more or less.  Each character eneded up with 13 complete shows so repetitions were quite plentiful, of course.Captain America would feature stories including Cap's origin retold from Tales of Suspense, The origin of Caps arch-enemy the Red Skull, And cap battling other villains such as Baron Zemo, The Masters of Evil, The Super Adaptoid, The Swordsman, and one of my favorite stories featuring the Sleeper Robots of the Red Skull.The Hulk (which featured EASILY the catchiest theme song of the bunch) would feature his origin (although curiously it was not the first episode) and also the hulk battling villains like The Leader, The Gorgon, The Abomination, and also feature the Hulk's breakup with the Avengers.Iron Man had some of the best villains in my humble opinion including other guys in suits of armore like the Crimson Dynamo, and the Titanium Man.  Also included on the villain list is the yellow menace ""The Mandarin"", The Moleman, and would include appearances by Hawkeye.The Submariner was always my least favorite on account of he was more villain than here to me.  I never really liked the water-based characters like him and Aquaman.  Typically the stories involved Atlantis being in danger of destruction.  There was a very good story featuring Doctor Doom, too.Thor was always my favorite.  Transformed from a lame doctor into the God of Thunder, thor battled the most powerful foes like the Enchantress, the Executioner, Loki, The Absorbing Man, The Destoyer, and featured a great adaption of ""Whom the Gods would Destroy"" from Journey into Myster #126.  Thor would also meet Hecules as well.As archaic as the animation may be this is still a fantastic trip back in time to the glorious silver age of comics.

These cartoons were good fun and made many a Marvel Comics fan in their day. Because they were geared toward young viewers, unlike later attempts to ""darken"" these comic characters for young adult audiences, these cartoons are more suitable for kids than ever, although some children may not like the older animation style. The animation is not expensive or top-notch, nor was it when these were new. Like most cartoons made for TV then and now, the animation was not beautifully done to save money. However, these shows are great fun and you can watch and share them with your children without suitability issues. For kids interested in TV history or just curious about what older shows were like, these cartoons are great fun. My son loved seeing the old Spiderman cartoons, Speed Racer and other old shows I watched when I was his age now that we can get them on DVD. We've also enjoyed many shows and films made before both our times that are now available on DVD or VHS, like Little Rascals and Space Patrol. If you and your children enjoy exploring older shows together and like comic book heroes then this set will be much enjoyed. If you saw these shows when you were younger, there's plenty of nostalgia value in them as well. These will surely be fun for casual comic book fans and many hard-core fanatics as well.
