1613400,A2CYV6VOL9YM0R,B00AMQGGFA,awesomep,"[1, 1]","Always wanted this movie, which was a little pricey at first.  Joe Penny is a fine romantic leading man.  He was charming and ruthless at the same time.  Melissa Gilbert played the damsel of the Prince Charming and happily ever after dreamer nicely.  It pays to be cautious of that charming person, who moves too quickly to steal one's heart.  Melissa was that person.  Joe was handsome, smart, and successful.  She couldn't understand why he picked her. It was apparent that she was lonely, and fell right into his trap.  Though I felt he truly loved her, his life was too dangerous.Melissa was not like the other wives.  Her character was strong and independent.  Joe's life was filled with violence and secrecy.  This was more than Melissa could handle.  Though she truly loved him, she had to make a choice, which would prove all too dangerous in the end.I did notice a part cut from the movie, maybe more since it's been so long that I've seen this movie.  If one's a Joe Penny fan, then this movie is good for it's day.  It's not very violent or bloody.",4,"Review is for, Blood Vows: The Story of a Mafia Wife.
