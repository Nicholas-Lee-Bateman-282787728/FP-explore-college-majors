I needed a good laugh and I got some.  Like another viewer said, why would the girl use baking ingredients left mysteriously in alley that were just in a box, no seal, no plastic wrap.....When they were dropped off, how did that person know the idiot bakers would add blood to it and deliver lightning bolts to the oven to activate it?  Dumb.  Also, all the characters knew of the dangerous gingerbread man in the bakery but they never left to get help, it was as easy as opening the door and leaving, but no...can't do that.

I discovered it from a site called Crack and looked it up on Youtube because I had to see it to believe it. I'll try to explain the overall set up as best I can.Let me see, we start out with the worse bank robber in the world who takes no money, but shoot people in this cafe. One of the 3 people in there Jeremy decides he ain't taking! This dude pulls out his knife and decides to give this robber a fight he'll never forget. He gets up and walks his way over to the robber and surprisingly doesn't get too far before he shot. MAN! I didn't see that coming! I had faith that Jeremy could kick some ass, but once again guns beat knives. Too bad. Next Jeremy's son is killed, but even killers have standards and decides to spare her (Sarah/Jeremy's daughter)...for some reason. The robber is caught, electrocuted, and then cremated, with his ashes sent to his mother. Skip ahead later and we find Sarah working in the family bakery with a boy named Brick. There's a knock on the door and Sarah answers it to find a box of gingerbread seasoning and the back of a retreating figure in a black robe. Not suspicions at all she assumes the person leaving this ONE box of gingerbread seasoning is the delivery man despite no papers having to be signed or anything. She and Brick proceed to prepare gingerbread mix. Brick somehow cuts his damn arm opening a box and instead of looking at the cut somewhere away from the dish their preparing, Brick hovers his bleeding arm over the bowl with the seasoning in it and blood drips into it without them seeing it. Somewhere a health inspector is crying. The oven malfunctions and out pops a killer cookie. You hear me right! We have killer dolls, killer animals, killer plants, and now kill pastries that throw out baking puns.This is definitely a movie you have to not take seriously to enjoy. It actually made me hungry for some cake and cookies so if you smoke weed this is the movie for you. I think the makers were high on brownies when they decided to make a horror movie about a killer cookie. I'm waiting for Attack of the Killer Toulet now.

Scream Queen Robin Sydney faces off against the mean little cookie with the BIG mouth in THE GINGERDEAD MAN, the latest Slasher series from Full Moon Entertainment. While THE GINGERDEAD MAN has all of the ingredients for a good B-Movie, it is taken far too seriously for a horror comedy, but is way too stupid to qualify as true horror, so it lies somewhere in between in killer cookie limbo. For the short run-time, the film sure is padded out with a lot of filler, and not of the gooey, gore-filled variety. The miniature cookie version of Gary Busey is armed to the teeth with bad puns and silly one-liners as he takes off after the kids, who never think to leave the bakery once the bodies start piling up. John Carl Buechler handles the make-up and special effects amiably, with his best efforts going into the design of the pissed-off cookie monster.

It is a combination ofChild's Play,Jack Frost, and thePuppet Mastermovies.Years after a madman, Millard Findlemeyer (played by Gary Busey), killed her father and brother, Sarah struggles to get on with her life even days after Findlemeyer was executed. His ashes was sent to his mother (aka a witch) who mixes it with gingerbread spice. The spice happens to end up at the bakery that Sarah works at with her mother.Sarah makes one big gingerbread man from the mix and brings Findlemeyer back from the dead. Now one by one, Findlemeyer kills anyone in his path as he sets to get his revenge.There are no computer special effects in the movie. What we do get is a gingerbread puppet as the killer.

943212,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B000BITVH4,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[1, 2]","THE GINGERDEAD MANI am a huge B movie fan and a fan of Charles Band and his Full Moon Pictures love the low budget style they bring. This one is one of those that you have to go into this knowing what you are getting and accept it. Gary Busey is indeed the Gingerdead Man; yes a gingerbread cookie with a killer attitude. This is absolutely not a classic and is absolutely pure low budget greatness, I love it. Plus I like the fact that the film is set in Waco Texas which is like little over an hour away from me.The Leigh family is killed in a robbery by a madman played by Busey except the little girl of the family. She sends him to jail with her testimony at court and he eventually goes to the chair. His mother says she will get revenge and after receives her son's ashes her plan takes place. She takes them to the bakery that Sarah Leigh owns and works at and gets it mixed into the gingerbread mix. Once the cookies are cut [this one in particular is bigger for some reason] and baked the fun begins as does the killing.Let me say from jump that the special effects for this film are as funny as the idea of this movie. The Gingerdead man looks cool and Busey is absolutely brilliant as the cookie, the writing favors him a lot. Writers August White and William Butler came up with a crazy idea some horrible dialogue and some funny one liners for the baked good. Charles Band is a producer and director for this one and while nowhere near earlier classics it is kinda funny.As for acting every one other Busey and his voice over and lead Robin Sydney need some work, some pretty bad stuff. Our lead shows that she can carry herself for the entire film but that is about it, also that one guy she hooks up seems like he is older than the character he plays. But overall the deaths are ok but are really funny because of how bad the film kinda is. I thought this film was funny and did not regret buying it, in fact part 2 [passion of the crust] here I come.",5,BUSEY SAVES THIS,1260748800,"12 14, 2009",2009,1967,"['GINGERDEAD', 'MANI', 'am', 'huge', 'B', 'movie', 'fan', 'fan', 'Charles', 'Band', 'Full', 'Moon', 'Pictures', 'love', 'low', 'budget', 'style', 'bring', 'one', 'one', 'have', 'go', 'knowing', 'what', 'are', 'getting', 'accept', 'Gary', 'Busey', 'indeed', 'Gingerdead', 'Man', 'gingerbread', 'cookie', 'killer', 'attitude', 'absolutely', 'not', 'classic', 'absolutely', 'pure', 'low', 'budget', 'greatness', 'love', 'like', 'fact', 'film', 'set', 'Waco', 'Texas', 'like', 'little', 'hour', 'away', 'me.The', 'Leigh', 'family', 'killed', 'robbery', 'madman', 'played', 'Busey', 'little', 'girl', 'family', 'jail', 'testimony', 'court', 'eventually', 'chair', 'mother', 'will', 'get', 'revenge', 'son', 'ashes', 'plan', 'place', 'bakery', 'Sarah', 'Leigh', 'mixed', 'gingerbread', 'mix', 'cookies', 'are', 'cut', 'one', 'particular', 'bigger', 'reason', ']', 'baked', 'fun', 'killing.Let', 'say', 'jump', 'special', 'effects', 'film', 'are', 'as', 'funny', 'idea', 'movie', 'Gingerdead', 'man', 'cool', 'Busey', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'cookie', 'writing', 'favors', 'lot', 'Writers', 'August', 'White', 'William', 'Butler', 'came', 'up', 'crazy', 'idea', 'horrible', 'dialogue', 'funny', 'one', 'liners', 'baked', 'good', 'Charles', 'Band', 'producer', 'director', 'one', 'nowhere', 'earlier', 'classics', 'kinda', 'funny.As', 'acting', 'one', 'other', 'Busey', 'voice', 'lead', 'Robin', 'Sydney', 'need', 'work', 'pretty', 'bad', 'stuff', 'lead', 'can', 'carry', 'entire', 'film', 'also', 'one', 'guy', 'up', 'older', 'character', 'overall', 'deaths', 'are', 'ok', 'are', 'really', 'funny', 'how', 'bad', 'film', 'kinda', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'funny', 'did', 'not', 'regret', 'buying', 'fact', 'part', '2', '[', 'passion', 'crust', ']', 'here', 'come']",The Gingerdead Man
943213,AHVG37KI3IM38,B000BITVH4,G-Fan,"[1, 2]","When I first heard about the premise for The Gingerdead Man, I thought, ""Now THAT sounds like a fun movie!""  Even after reading all of the one and two star reviews here on Amazon, I decided that I still wanted to see it, and thereby make up my own mind about its merits, or lack thereof...This movie has two things going for it - the overall ridiculous concept, and of course, Gary Busey.  Busey is actually on camera for only the first five or so minutes.  After the beginning, he doesn't ""reappear"" until near the second half of the film, and then as the voice only of the titular character.It turns out that what could have been a great B-movie ends up being let down by a weak and meandering script, some oftentimes painful and dull acting, and some rather uninspired direction.  Like many other reviewers, I remember Charles Band and Full Moon from their glory days in the late 80s and 1990s.  Sad to say that if The Gingerdead Man is any indication, those days are long past.  Oh, it has its moments, mostly once the maniacal killer cookie comes to life.  But even then, many of the jokes and one-liners fall flat, and don't even begin to make up for the slow moving pace and rather depressing atmosphere of the first half of the film.  In fact, the female lead's morose behavior started to get to me after awhile.  Understandable, taking into account what her character had been through, but considering the film's title and its outrageously laughable premise, the script just seemed to dwell on the poor girl's overwhelming sense of loss and heartache for far too long.  I wanted it to get to the fun stuff!When the fun stuff finally came, it was almost too little too late.  There were a couple of cool kills, but nothing we hadn't seen many times before.  Only these came by way of a killer pastry.  It was pretty much a one-set movie, with all of the action taking place inside the bakery, or on the street just outside. I think perhaps the most amusing part was the short sequence where the Gingerdead Man drives a car.  Pretty funny stuff, but again, all too brief.In short, with a good bit of hesitation, I suppose I would rate it as a film that just might be worth seeing.  Just don't expect to be dazzled and blown away by a witty script, deliriously goofy dialogue, and heavy doses of humor, because it just isn't there.  As I said, there were a few good bits to be sure.  But I can't help but feel the filmmakers squandered a golden opportunity to possibly do something really great.  The whole thing just seemed a bit lazy and uninspired.  I rate the film itself two stars, but I'll toss in an extra star for Gary Busey's presence, even if he did only have five minutes of screen time.",3,Delicious Recipe For Horror/Comedy That Somehow Comes Out Half-Baked,1342310400,"07 15, 2012",2012,2704,"['When', 'first', 'heard', 'premise', 'Gingerdead', 'Man', 'thought', 'Now', 'fun', 'movie', 'Even', 'reading', 'one', 'two', 'star', 'reviews', 'here', 'Amazon', 'decided', 'still', 'wanted', 'see', 'thereby', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'mind', 'merits', 'lack', 'thereof', 'movie', 'two', 'things', 'going', 'overall', 'ridiculous', 'concept', 'course', 'Gary', 'Busey', 'Busey', 'actually', 'camera', 'only', 'first', 'five', 'so', 'minutes', 'beginning', ""n't"", 'reappear', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'then', 'voice', 'only', 'titular', 'character.It', 'out', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'B-movie', 'up', 'being', 'let', 'down', 'weak', 'meandering', 'script', 'oftentimes', 'painful', 'dull', 'acting', 'rather', 'uninspired', 'direction', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'remember', 'Charles', 'Band', 'Full', 'Moon', 'glory', 'days', 'late', '80s', '1990s', 'Sad', 'say', 'Gingerdead', 'Man', 'indication', 'days', 'are', 'long', 'past', 'Oh', 'moments', 'mostly', 'maniacal', 'killer', 'cookie', 'life', 'even', 'then', 'many', 'jokes', 'one-liners', 'fall', 'flat', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'make', 'up', 'slow', 'moving', 'pace', 'rather', 'depressing', 'atmosphere', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'fact', 'female', 'lead', 'morose', 'behavior', 'started', 'get', 'awhile', 'Understandable', 'taking', 'account', 'what', 'character', 'had', 'been', 'considering', 'film', 'title', 'outrageously', 'laughable', 'premise', 'script', 'just', 'seemed', 'dwell', 'poor', 'girl', 'overwhelming', 'sense', 'loss', 'heartache', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'wanted', 'get', 'fun', 'stuff', 'When', 'fun', 'stuff', 'finally', 'came', 'was', 'almost', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'late', 'were', 'couple', 'cool', 'kills', 'nothing', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'many', 'times', 'before', 'Only', 'came', 'way', 'killer', 'pastry', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'one-set', 'movie', 'action', 'taking', 'place', 'bakery', 'street', 'just', 'think', 'perhaps', 'most', 'amusing', 'part', 'was', 'short', 'sequence', 'where', 'Gingerdead', 'Man', 'car', 'Pretty', 'funny', 'stuff', 'again', 'too', 'brief.In', 'short', 'good', 'bit', 'hesitation', 'suppose', 'would', 'rate', 'film', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'worth', 'seeing', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'dazzled', 'blown', 'away', 'witty', 'script', 'deliriously', 'goofy', 'dialogue', 'heavy', 'doses', 'humor', 'just', ""n't"", 'there', 'said', 'were', 'few', 'good', 'bits', 'be', 'sure', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'filmmakers', 'squandered', 'golden', 'opportunity', 'possibly', 'do', 'something', 'really', 'great', 'whole', 'thing', 'just', 'seemed', 'bit', 'lazy', 'uninspired', 'rate', 'film', 'two', 'stars', ""'ll"", 'toss', 'extra', 'star', 'Gary', 'Busey', 'presence', 'even', 'did', 'only', 'have', 'five', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time']",The Gingerdead Man

Gary Busey overacts for the entire 10 minutes that he's actually in the film as a grimacing, murdering maniac who returns from beyond the grave to possess a gingerbread man.From that moment on, the story revolves around the owners of a bakery trying to escape from the bakery while the gingerbusey tries to kill them while making lame Freddy Kreuger one-liners. This is almost bad enough to be enjoyable if you watch it after drinking a bottle of whiskey, but then chances are it would just put you to sleep.I've said it before in my reviews Full Moon's other recent flops like DOLL GRAVEYARD and DECADENT EVIL, but it bears repeating. Band should be banned from making any more horror films. The really sad part is that I used to like Full Moon movies. They were just bad enough to be enjoyable, and I have quite a few of the Full Moon movies from the 90's sitting on the shelf with my Troma flicks. But these recent movies are poor and shoddy in comparison, and they lack the humor and campiness that the early Full Moon flicks had.

943216,A20L3YKLJA2G95,B000BITVH4,Jay,"[1, 2]","In 1989 the world was intorduced to Charles Bands' super low budget horror company know as Full Moon Productions. The company became popular off of it's cult favored Puppet Master in 1989 and has been pumping out a variety of a films over the years. They all tend to be extremely low budget but that's really their claim to fame. The company doesn't try to be something it's not and that's why I enjoy their films. Yes the acting, special effects, and storylines are really bad. But they are really fun to watch in that so good it's bad way. The Gingerdeadman stays on the border of watchable and promises to provide some laughs if nothing else. Hey they even got Gary Busey to show up straight from his celebrity rehab session. However after a couple days of shooting he probably checked back in for an extended stay.We start off with crazed killer Millard Findlemeyer (Gary Busey) after he wipes out a family at a diner except for one girl. This girl winds up sending him away to be charged up by the electric chair and somehow his remains get into a box of gingerbread batter. This batter is then delivered to the bakery she works at and the laughs insue. A drop of blood winds up going in the batter forcing the spirit of Millard to come to life as a gingerbread man. For a 2 ft bakery item this is one tough cookie. It is just hilarious to watch these terrible actors running around as if there is no script to be found trying to hide from the wrath of the Gingerdead man.The only way possible to enjoy this movie is if you're a huge fan of extreme low grade b horror. In no way is The Gingerdead Man a good movie for the serious watcher. It's really geared towards those who are looking to get a good laugh, not a scare. For those people who have any question if Gary Busey has completely lost it all you have to do is pop this one in.

You heard me... 1 HOUR.  and 7 minutes of it is beginning and ending credits.  Even as a derivative work this falls woefully short of being entertainment.  The plot resembles swiss cheese that's been hit with a 12 guage shot gun.  Gary Busey, who must still be suffering from being on his ""celebrity fat farm"" show and grappling with alcohol and/or substance abuse, provides all of 3 minutes screen time and the incessant ""chucky like"" audio of the ginger bread man to this garbage.  The plot is almost identical to Child's Play.  A killer dies and gets re-animated vis a vis an improbable inanimate object. (in this case a gingerbread man, and yes they make a pillsbury dough boy joke in this god awful waste of celluloid)  The acting is spotty all around from the cast. (Snotty rich blonde girlfriend, unworthy for me to remember the name, is sooo bad at her role I actually wanted to throw a brick at my TV) Gary gets points for acting crazy... but is it really acting?  The filmmakers make sure to add plenty of nubile 20 something eye candy (for both guys and girls) by making sure all the main characters are in skin tight clothes.  If you want a combination slash/flasher flick, look elsewhere... there's zero nudity.  Let's get down to the goods.  It's short. VERY short.

943231,A3UA046AA3DXFD,B000BITVH4,Sid the Elf,"[9, 11]","This week we decided to give you our thoughts on The Gingerdead Man staring Gary Busey. This is the prototypical B movie ladies and gentlemen. It had it all! Awful acting, special effects that could have been topped by a third grade art class, ridiculous dialouge, and for an added bonus: rednecks!Gary Busey plays a killer who kills all but one in the family who owns and opperates a diner in Anytown, U.S.A. The daughter who remains alive, now runs the place. She has since testified against Busey, who is executed and cremated. Now, Busey's mother is heartbroken, so she does what any good Mom would do: she dumps her son's ashes into the gingerbread dough at the diner in order to exact revenge. At this point, all she needs is a little blood to drip into the dough, and that's it, instant horror B! It's that easy, folks. Anyway, the blood is provided by the idiot boyfriend who pretends to be a wrestler. He gets cut while trying to give himself a sharpshooter.It's here that Busey comes alive as the Gingerdead man and starts the body count rolling. A bright spot is that the Miz was among the first to go. So, he obviously is stopped. But, they leave this one open for a sequel. Sid can only hope that Full Moon will stay with the Celebrity Fit Club routine and get Screech to star in Bearded Gingerdead Man 2. Maybe the gingerdead man can come back as the keyboard player in Zack Attack. Just the fact that Sid considered this while watching the movie tells you how B it was.Note an added star was added due to an accidental appearance by a stagehand hiding behind a ladder.  Good work Full Moon!  Just when we thought you disappeared off the face of the earth, you totally redeem yourself gaining a star below the one and only DEATH RING. So, once again, we definitely recommend The Gingerdead Man if you're in the mood for a good old-fashioned B-horror.

943232,A2CT2SA6KFE8GC,B000BITVH4,"Stanley Runk ""Runkdapunk""","[1, 3]","The Gingerdead Man has an outrageous and fun sounding concept.  Unfortunately that's all it has going for it.  Charles Band continues his obsession with tiny terrors by shelving the killer dolls and puppets and making way for a killer gingerbread cookie.  Sound fun?  Sure it does, but is really isn't.  Well, it has a few fleeting moments.Gary Busey is a lunatic who goes on a killing spree in a bakery(Why?  How the hell do we know?), leaving only two survivors, Robin Sydney and her mother.  Busey is apprehended and sentenced to the chair.  Sydney and her mother continue to run the bakery.  Soon after Busey's execution a mysterious figure drops a package of gingerbread seasoning on the doorstep of the bakery.  Guess what's in it?  It's Busey's ashes!  Through a series of ludicrous and totally illogical events, these ashes become the Gingerdead Man.  Now he's out for revenge, terrorizing the few occupants of the bakery after business hours.  It's pretty much the same concept as Child's Play or Jack Frost with a murderer being reborn as a seemingly harmless inanimate object.First off, we never leave the bakery.  The entire film is either shot inside the bakery or right out in front of it.  This is kinda irritating, especially since there are numerous opportunities for the characters to simply leave the bakery, but they don't.  Gotta keep within budget, ya know?  Can't have another set for Pete's sake!  Band seems so thrilled with his concept that he simply doesn't care how Busey goes from human killer to cookie killer just as long as it happens.  I know logic must be somewhat ignored in a horror film, but a middle school kid coulda wrote a better series of events.  Let me ask you all something:  If you owned a bakery and an employee cut his hand, would you quickly move his hands over the cookie batter so he could bleed into it?  And still bake the cookies???Anyhow, also like Child's Play and Jack Frost, Busey shows up briefly in the beginning of the film and spends the remainder as the voice of the ""monster"".  He spews profanities and terrible one liners, some of which actually are kinda funny.  Busey is one of the more better known character actors of the last 20+ years, and I'm sure he's not exactly in dire straits.  I wonder why he did this film.  Maybe he liked it and did it for fun.But as we all know, Full Moon has made some very cool little horror pictures throughout the 90s, but the quality of the films started becoming very questionable by the end of the decade.  This film is a good example of those latter days and not so much an example of the Puppet Master days.  I've certainly seen worse films from Full Moon.  The Gingerdead Man isn't terribly good, but it isn't without a few moments of fun.  But anyone familiar with Full Moon should know what to expect from this, so judge accordingly.",2,Kinda Crumb-Y,1214438400,"06 26, 2008",2008,2843,"['Gingerdead', 'Man', 'outrageous', 'fun', 'sounding', 'concept', 'Unfortunately', 'going', 'Charles', 'Band', 'obsession', 'tiny', 'terrors', 'shelving', 'killer', 'dolls', 'puppets', 'making', 'way', 'killer', 'gingerbread', 'cookie', 'Sound', 'fun', 'Sure', 'really', ""n't"", 'Well', 'few', 'fleeting', 'moments.Gary', 'Busey', 'lunatic', 'who', 'killing', 'spree', 'bakery', 'Why', 'How', 'hell', 'do', 'know', 'leaving', 'only', 'two', 'survivors', 'Robin', 'Sydney', 'mother', 'Busey', 'apprehended', 'sentenced', 'chair', 'Sydney', 'mother', 'continue', 'run', 'bakery', 'Soon', 'Busey', 'execution', 'mysterious', 'figure', 'package', 'gingerbread', 'seasoning', 'doorstep', 'bakery', 'Guess', 'what', 'Busey', 'ashes', 'series', 'ludicrous', 'totally', 'illogical', 'events', 'ashes', 'become', 'Gingerdead', 'Man', 'Now', 'out', 'revenge', 'terrorizing', 'few', 'occupants', 'bakery', 'business', 'hours', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'concept', 'Child', 'Play', 'Jack', 'Frost', 'murderer', 'being', 'reborn', 'seemingly', 'harmless', 'inanimate', 'object.First', 'off', 'never', 'leave', 'bakery', 'entire', 'film', 'shot', 'bakery', 'right', 'out', 'front', 'kinda', 'irritating', 'especially', 'are', 'numerous', 'opportunities', 'characters', 'simply', 'leave', 'bakery', 'do', ""n't"", 'Got', 'ta', 'keep', 'budget', 'ya', 'know', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'set', 'Pete', 'sake', 'Band', 'so', 'thrilled', 'concept', 'simply', ""n't"", 'care', 'how', 'Busey', 'human', 'killer', 'cookie', 'killer', 'just', 'as', 'long', 'know', 'logic', 'must', 'be', 'somewhat', 'ignored', 'horror', 'film', 'middle', 'school', 'kid', 'coulda', 'wrote', 'better', 'series', 'events', 'Let', 'ask', 'something', 'owned', 'bakery', 'employee', 'cut', 'hand', 'would', 'quickly', 'move', 'hands', 'cookie', 'batter', 'could', 'bleed', 'still', 'bake', 'cookies', 'Anyhow', 'also', 'Child', 'Play', 'Jack', 'Frost', 'Busey', 'up', 'briefly', 'beginning', 'film', 'remainder', 'voice', 'monster', 'profanities', 'terrible', 'one', 'liners', 'actually', 'are', 'kinda', 'funny', 'Busey', 'one', 'more', 'better', 'known', 'character', 'actors', 'last', '20+', 'years', ""'m"", 'sure', 'not', 'exactly', 'dire', 'straits', 'wonder', 'why', 'did', 'film', 'Maybe', 'liked', 'did', 'fun.But', 'know', 'Full', 'Moon', 'made', 'very', 'cool', 'little', 'horror', 'pictures', '90s', 'quality', 'films', 'started', 'becoming', 'very', 'questionable', 'end', 'decade', 'film', 'good', 'example', 'latter', 'days', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'example', 'Puppet', 'Master', 'days', ""'ve"", 'certainly', 'seen', 'worse', 'films', 'Full', 'Moon', 'Gingerdead', 'Man', ""n't"", 'terribly', 'good', ""n't"", 'few', 'moments', 'fun', 'anyone', 'familiar', 'Full', 'Moon', 'should', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'so', 'judge', 'accordingly']",The Gingerdead Man

I can't work out if it's deliberately bad or not...the actors seem to be playing it deadpan, but the plot and dialogue are beyond absurd. Another flaw is this film's seeming lack of awareness. When the ""Gingerdead"" man comes alive and starts killing people in the bakery, he comes equipped with some knock-out punchlines to add a bit of vile humour to proceedings...the only problem being that they're not remotely funny.
