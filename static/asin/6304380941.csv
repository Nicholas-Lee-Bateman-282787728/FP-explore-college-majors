Michelle Pfeiffer is barely in this film since she plays a ghost but she is a flawless and stunning actress - it doesn't hurt that her husband, David E. Kelley wrote the script. Claire Danes is wonderful as well, she is good at playing a brooding teen.

I never saw the stage play which many say is so much better than this adaptation.  That said, what I watched came across as very real.  There have been reviews that bemoan the lack of drama.  That's what struck me most about this movie is that it wasn't overly dramatic.  Not every story requires hysteria to succeed.  There is a large portion of our society who's family dynamics are reserved and restrained.  This is not to say that there are no intense moments.  There are but they appear at the right moments when limits are pushed beyond the reserved and restrained.  The characters came across as ordinary and very real.  I've seen a lot of death in my life and generally avoid movies like this but came across it channel surfing.  It interested me enough to find an upcoming broadcast so that I could watch it from beginning to end.

417424,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,6304380941,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[4, 9]","Gillian (Michelle Pfeiffer) died in a freak accident on her husbands boat on her birthday two years ago. Now a widower, her husband David (Peter Gallagher) is stuck in funk partly embittered and partly delusional about his loss. Caring alone for his daughter Rachel(Claire Daines) in their beachside home on some New England coast, secretly imagining that Gillian is still with him, David's peaceful existence is disturbed by the arrival of Gillian's sister Esther (Kathy Baker, an alum of David Kelley's ""Picket Fences"") and her husband, Paul (Bruce Altman). It's not quite clear why David is supposed to put up with these pests who want to save him by getting him to let go of his late wife (or at least save Rachel from a shriveling existence with her batty father). (Less clear is why Rachel's obnoxious and flirtatious friend remains a constant presence - she's much too adventurous for the shy Rachel, and doesn't find Paul's leery advances any more preferable.)For a feature film, ""Gillian"" packs less entertainment than an episode of Ally Mcbeal, and fills the vacuum with standard TV wisdom (you've got to let go of the past; it's better to love and lose than never love at all). Director David Kelly centers the film around the gorgeous Michelle Phieffer, but never makes much of her - is she a ghost or is David really losing his mind?  She's not even convincing as a delusion. ""Gillian"" takes itself pretty seriously, but it's thin stuff, dressed up in gorgeous scenery - the beach, the house and even the boat that carries Gillian to her watery end are picture perfect.  In fact, it doesn't take too long before ""Gillian"" begins resembling less a movie than a really long infomercial for J-Crew or The Gap (when one scene cuts to another of Rachel and her friend trying on thongs, you'll know for certain). Even the chatty interplay between Paul and Rachel's flirty friend, which was fine when it stayed light, takes a heavy turn when she serves a nasty rebuff for an advance he hadn't made.  Paul is left to ponder if his safer, and undminished existence really beats his brother-in law's bereaved widowhood. ""If life were a truck"" he asks Esther afterwards ""is it better to let it run over you to let it pass you by?"" It's actually a beguiling question, but not one the rest of the script does any justice - only a hint of what could have been a better movie, and a loss really worth mourning. Esther's response is good - probably too good. (The flick had the choice of giving her a trite answer that might actually explain this self-important film, or one gets some laughs, and its choice shows where the scipt's priorities really are.)  In short, neither very insightful nor imaginative, an uninspired flick that passes in the night like a wraith.",2,looks more like a 2 hour J-Crew infommercial than a movie,992476800,"06 14, 2001",2001,2764,"['Gillian', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'died', 'freak', 'accident', 'husbands', 'boat', 'birthday', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'Now', 'widower', 'husband', 'David', 'Peter', 'Gallagher', 'stuck', 'funk', 'partly', 'embittered', 'partly', 'delusional', 'loss', 'Caring', 'alone', 'daughter', 'Rachel', 'Claire', 'Daines', 'beachside', 'home', 'New', 'England', 'coast', 'secretly', 'imagining', 'Gillian', 'still', 'David', 'peaceful', 'existence', 'disturbed', 'arrival', 'Gillian', 'sister', 'Esther', 'Kathy', 'Baker', 'alum', 'David', 'Kelley', 'Picket', 'Fences', 'husband', 'Paul', 'Bruce', 'Altman', 'not', 'quite', 'clear', 'why', 'David', 'supposed', 'put', 'up', 'pests', 'who', 'want', 'save', 'getting', 'let', 'go', 'late', 'wife', 'least', 'save', 'Rachel', 'shriveling', 'existence', 'batty', 'father', 'Less', 'clear', 'why', 'Rachel', 'obnoxious', 'flirtatious', 'friend', 'constant', 'presence', 'much', 'too', 'adventurous', 'shy', 'Rachel', ""n't"", 'find', 'Paul', 'leery', 'more', 'preferable', 'feature', 'film', 'Gillian', 'packs', 'less', 'entertainment', 'episode', 'Ally', 'Mcbeal', 'vacuum', 'standard', 'TV', 'wisdom', ""'ve"", 'got', 'let', 'go', 'past', 'better', 'love', 'lose', 'never', 'love', 'Director', 'David', 'Kelly', 'film', 'gorgeous', 'Michelle', 'Phieffer', 'never', 'much', 'ghost', 'David', 'really', 'losing', 'mind', 'not', 'even', 'convincing', 'delusion', 'Gillian', 'pretty', 'seriously', 'thin', 'stuff', 'dressed', 'up', 'gorgeous', 'scenery', 'beach', 'house', 'even', 'boat', 'Gillian', 'watery', 'end', 'are', 'picture', 'perfect', 'fact', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'long', 'Gillian', 'resembling', 'less', 'movie', 'really', 'long', 'infomercial', 'J-Crew', 'Gap', 'when', 'one', 'scene', 'cuts', 'Rachel', 'friend', 'trying', 'thongs', ""'ll"", 'know', 'certain', 'Even', 'chatty', 'interplay', 'Paul', 'Rachel', 'flirty', 'friend', 'was', 'fine', 'when', 'stayed', 'light', 'heavy', 'turn', 'when', 'nasty', 'rebuff', 'advance', 'had', ""n't"", 'made', 'Paul', 'left', 'ponder', 'safer', 'undminished', 'existence', 'really', 'brother-in', 'law', 'bereaved', 'widowhood', 'life', 'were', 'truck', 'Esther', 'afterwards', 'better', 'let', 'run', 'let', 'pass', 'actually', 'beguiling', 'question', 'not', 'one', 'rest', 'script', 'justice', 'only', 'hint', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'movie', 'loss', 'really', 'worth', 'mourning', 'Esther', 'response', 'good', 'probably', 'too', 'good', 'flick', 'had', 'choice', 'giving', 'trite', 'answer', 'might', 'actually', 'explain', 'self-important', 'film', 'one', 'laughs', 'choice', 'shows', 'where', 'scipt', 'priorities', 'really', 'are', 'short', 'very', 'insightful', 'imaginative', 'uninspired', 'flick', 'night', 'wraith']",To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday VHS
417425,AP9RVNCXHB3OB,6304380941,Thayer,"[1, 1]","An easy to watch drama (with some comedy) that is sweet but thankfully not the ""over the top sweet"" these kinds of movies often become. It's a simple engaging story that is very easy to relate to since the movie tackled subjects like loneliness, moving on, and connections in an amusing and ultimately heartwarming way.Peter Gallagher stars as David who after 2 years of his wife's death Gillian (played by the gorgeous Michelle Pfeiffer) due to a boating accident still cannot seem to accept the fact that she's gone. In fact when no one is watching he still interacts with her dead wife like she was still alive. That causes a conflict with his daughter who was having a hard time dealing with her mom's death because her father doesn't seem to acknowledge that her wife is already dead. Kathy Baker played Gillian's sister who wants to take her daughter since she doesn't think that David was capable of raising his daughter.Peter Gallagher gave a great performance. He gets to butcher the song ""You Make Me Feel Like Dancing"", compete with a nine year old in building a sand castle contest, and he gets to play the heartbroken man who was so in love with his wife he doesn't want to let go. It was a great part for him. Claire Danes once again showed her sensitivity as an actress as she realistically portrayed the aches of her character. Michelle Pfeiffer in a semi cameo role was luminous, in the few scenes she was in she lights up the screen like a goddess.Towards the end of the movie, the supposedly rational Kathy Baker and Bruce Altman after giving lectures on practicality, responsibility etc. and how talking to your dead wife is silly, were both secretly jealous that they don't have that kind of passion for each other.It's those kinds of moment that elevate this film into just another romance movie.Grade: B+",5,To Gillian on her 37th Birthday,1126051200,"09 7, 2005",2005,1827,"['easy', 'watch', 'drama', 'comedy', 'sweet', 'thankfully', 'not', 'top', 'sweet', 'kinds', 'movies', 'often', 'become', 'simple', 'engaging', 'story', 'very', 'easy', 'relate', 'movie', 'tackled', 'subjects', 'loneliness', 'moving', 'connections', 'amusing', 'ultimately', 'heartwarming', 'way.Peter', 'Gallagher', 'David', 'who', '2', 'years', 'wife', 'death', 'Gillian', 'played', 'gorgeous', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'due', 'boating', 'accident', 'still', 'can', 'not', 'seem', 'accept', 'fact', 'gone', 'fact', 'when', 'one', 'watching', 'still', 'dead', 'wife', 'was', 'still', 'alive', 'conflict', 'daughter', 'who', 'was', 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'dealing', 'mom', 'death', 'father', ""n't"", 'seem', 'acknowledge', 'wife', 'already', 'dead', 'Kathy', 'Baker', 'played', 'Gillian', 'sister', 'who', 'take', 'daughter', ""n't"", 'think', 'David', 'was', 'capable', 'raising', 'daughter.Peter', 'Gallagher', 'gave', 'great', 'performance', 'butcher', 'song', 'Make', 'Me', 'Feel', 'Dancing', 'compete', 'nine', 'year', 'old', 'building', 'sand', 'castle', 'contest', 'play', 'heartbroken', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'so', 'love', 'wife', ""n't"", 'want', 'let', 'go', 'was', 'great', 'part', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'once', 'again', 'showed', 'sensitivity', 'actress', 'realistically', 'portrayed', 'aches', 'character', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'semi', 'cameo', 'role', 'was', 'luminous', 'few', 'scenes', 'was', 'screen', 'goddess.Towards', 'end', 'movie', 'supposedly', 'rational', 'Kathy', 'Baker', 'Bruce', 'Altman', 'giving', 'lectures', 'practicality', 'responsibility', 'etc', 'how', 'talking', 'dead', 'wife', 'silly', 'were', 'secretly', 'jealous', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'kind', 'passion', 'other.It', 'kinds', 'moment', 'elevate', 'film', 'just', 'romance', 'movie.Grade', 'B+']",To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday VHS
