264430,A1JTTI1KH3DOCY,6301760360,"Doggymcnuggets ""doggymcnuggets""","[1, 3]","This is one Christmas tale that I really want to love - it has the charm of the Rankin & Bass stop-motion holiday classics, it features one of my favorite artists (Roger Miller) doing the narration & songs, and it is bold enough to venture into the religious meaning of Christmas.  But unfortunately this one just doesn't come together.First, at approximately 30 minutes it is too short and feels rushed.  The story doesn't have time to unfold with much drama and the climactic dilemma of the sandstorm is very anticlimactic.  My favorite Rankin & Bass Christmas shows, like Rudolph and Santa Claus is Comin' to Town, were designed as hour long broadcasts and the extra time to develop the characters and story pays off.  Second, the music is not very good - and again, I am a huge Roger Miller fan.  The signature song that is woven through the story is just an average ditty far less memorable than Burl Ives' songs from Rudolph, for example.  Finally, the odd mix of religious and secular ideas and characters is weird and might confuse children of families wanting to teach their kids about Jesus and His birth.  You've got Nestor the fictitious donkey, historical Roman soldiers, a fairy-like cherub (which we learn is not an angel - cherubs are creatures put there to help animals fulfill God's plans!?!), Joseph and Mary, etc.  All in all an odd mix for me.I watched Nestor with my 4 year old son and there was an obvious disinterest for him.  He normally dialogues with me a lot when he likes a show and gets into the story, but Nestor came and went with little response from him at all.  I really want to like Nestor, but this one just doesn't make the cut as a Christmas classic.

264431,A3H82LUT1EC655,6301760360,Erika Sorocco,"[8, 8]","When Nestor, a donkey with unusually long ears, is born in a small stable near Bethlehem, he is mocked by everyone. And soon, him and his Mother are thrown out of the stable, into a terrible blizzard. Nestor's Mother, wanting to keep her child warm, covers him with her body, and, when Nestor awakes the next morning, he finds his beloved Mother dead. Frozen to death while trying to protect her baby. When the springtime comes, Nestor meets a young cherub, who helps to guide him on his path to save another, as his Mother saved him. And when two travelers choose Nestor for a trip to a manger near Bethlehem, Nestor knows that he can finally accomplish his mission in life.Out of ever holiday story, NESTOR THE LONG-EARED CHRISTMAS DONKEY, is, and always will be, one of the most touching, and heartwarming movies ever created. Rankin/Bass did a fantastic job with the animation and dialogue in this film. And Nestor is one of the sweetest, and kindest characters to ever appear in a holiday special. Rankin/Bass really made it so that you sympathize with Nestor throughout the entire movie. Which is a huge plus.
