1280336,A20EEWWSFMZ1PN,B002NWRMO0,"bernie ""xyzzy""","[29, 33]","This documentary stays focused on origami however, it is much more a documentary on interdisciplinary art. What is more interesting is that what make origami art can be applied to just about any art or discipline.The one big plus about this documentary is that it is not a collage of meaningless soundbites. We can almost use this as a training film or at least a professional class.We start out with the kitsch factor of origami then go through the different forms of origami. Then we get to meet the man that really changed the concept of origami Akira Yoshizawa. From there we learn that there can be more than meets the eye with the mathematical application of origami and the origami application on geometry. We apply origami to potentially all forms of science. Then we even apply it to practical applications as folding of air bags for automobiles.Now let us slow down and see that the individual artists and engineers presenting this program also are presenting the evolution of how people become experts in their field.  We see that everything starts out (concise or otherwise) as a series of simple skills and progress into complexity. We try to imitate reality. Later we realize that am imitation is just that and drop the effort to imitate in place of capturing its essence. You see this in artists and writers that appear to have gone off the deep end. It also applies to practicality when we stop making robots to look like people and instead capture the functions needed.If we do not take the time to contemplate the impact of origami on the world, the documentary is just fun to see what you can make or maybe purchase in the world.I would really have liked to see an expanded documentary on papermaking.Dr. Erik D.

In this documentary, we start with origamists creating the most realistic forms and then move on to the postmodern artists stripping away detail down to its simplest shape.Because I have a modern aesthetic, I was drawn more to the simpler shapes...from the tall slender woman cloaked in a soft robe to the abstract forms that are interesting in how the light bounces of them.These origamists differed not only in their degree of realism, but also in what motivated them to create origami.  Most of the origamists created for artistic pleasure while others created simply for the mathematical challenge.  And one origamist even found a practical application to help fight diseases.But what they all had in common was a clear passion for origami.  It was interesting watching how each origamist pushed to see how far this medium could go.  We start with artists creating still life forms to artists who could make the medium move (like the man who created a tower and then with a push of his finger, made the tower collapse and transform into a flower).Overall, I thought this documentary was well organized and also taught me just how complex this medium really is.",4,The complexity of a simple piece of paper,1290124800,"11 19, 2010",2010,1297,"['explained', 'documentary', 'intro', 'origamists', 'are', 'sculptors', ""'re"", 'able', 'create', 'form', 'flat', 'medium', 'documentary', 'start', 'origamists', 'creating', 'most', 'realistic', 'forms', 'then', 'move', 'postmodern', 'artists', 'stripping', 'away', 'detail', 'down', 'simplest', 'shape.Because', 'have', 'modern', 'aesthetic', 'was', 'drawn', 'more', 'simpler', 'shapes', 'tall', 'slender', 'woman', 'cloaked', 'soft', 'robe', 'abstract', 'forms', 'are', 'interesting', 'how', 'light', 'bounces', 'them.These', 'origamists', 'differed', 'not', 'only', 'degree', 'realism', 'also', 'what', 'motivated', 'create', 'origami', 'Most', 'origamists', 'created', 'artistic', 'pleasure', 'others', 'created', 'simply', 'mathematical', 'challenge', 'one', 'origamist', 'even', 'found', 'practical', 'application', 'help', 'fight', 'diseases.But', 'what', 'had', 'common', 'was', 'clear', 'passion', 'origami', 'was', 'interesting', 'watching', 'how', 'origamist', 'pushed', 'see', 'how', 'far', 'medium', 'could', 'go', 'start', 'artists', 'creating', 'still', 'life', 'forms', 'artists', 'who', 'could', 'make', 'medium', 'move', 'man', 'who', 'created', 'tower', 'then', 'push', 'finger', 'made', 'tower', 'collapse', 'transform', 'flower', '.Overall', 'thought', 'documentary', 'was', 'well', 'organized', 'also', 'taught', 'just', 'how', 'complex', 'medium', 'really']",Independent Lens: Between the Folds

But everyone on display here is in one way or another a treat to watch and consider. Origami obviously attracts some very bright minds, minds not afraid to fold in on themselves intensely and with much happiness.I played some with this art form as a kid, but these guys take it to a whole 'nother plane. And planes. And zones. There's a lot to ponder for the math geek in all of us here, and even more for the lover of epiphanic symmetries and tesselations.

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[36, 39]","When this 55-minute documentary - which played on PBS - begins you are amazed at how intricate practitioners of Origami (Japanese art of paper folding) are. You see one single piece of paper (though it could be five feet in length) become a lizard or a violist or a beautiful multi-colored abstract sculpture. (They use special colored paper to create the latter). Origami requires that the artist use a single sheet, no cutting and no pasting. )> The word ""Amazing"" pops into your head. How o they do this? (Answer: hours and hors of folding and a mind that sees the result long before they start.) The high-definition quality of the original film and its DVD transfer will bring out these astoundingly beautiful images on practically any TV set.But about half way through the film - when writer, producer and director Vanessa Gould has you mesmerized - we move from the artists to the ""mathematicians"" who use the paper folding to solve long time mathematical questions and teach students in elementary schools about math through origami. You'll meet the father and son geniuses (the younger becoming a professor at MIT at age 20!) that are using it to help scientists examinethe forms of human body cells and DNA. As the son says, ""we may even, someday, find a cure for AIDS"". Then there is the teacher who has integrated origami into the math curriculum in all the elementary schools in Israel and the results of test show that it improves the students' scores.This film won many festival awards and deservedly so.The DVD includes a collection of ""deleted scenes"" (my favorite is the genius son who says he does this only because it has to be fun) as well as a six-minute short film (also by Gould) about the Israeli school program.Whether you appreciate art or science or just want to be fascinated for an hour, this is film that I can highly recommend!Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",5,"Beautiful, amazing art and what may help find the cure to AIDS and other diseases..",1261872000,"12 27, 2009",2009,1891,"['When', '55-minute', 'documentary', 'played', 'PBS', 'are', 'amazed', 'how', 'intricate', 'practitioners', 'Origami', 'Japanese', 'art', 'paper', 'folding', 'are', 'see', 'one', 'single', 'piece', 'paper', 'could', 'be', 'five', 'feet', 'length', 'become', 'lizard', 'violist', 'beautiful', 'multi-colored', 'abstract', 'sculpture', 'use', 'special', 'colored', 'paper', 'create', 'latter', 'Origami', 'artist', 'use', 'single', 'sheet', 'cutting', 'pasting', '>', 'word', 'Amazing', 'pops', 'head', 'How', 'o', 'do', 'Answer', 'hours', 'hors', 'folding', 'mind', 'result', 'long', 'start', 'high-definition', 'quality', 'original', 'film', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'will', 'bring', 'out', 'astoundingly', 'beautiful', 'images', 'practically', 'TV', 'set.But', 'half', 'way', 'film', 'when', 'writer', 'producer', 'director', 'Vanessa', 'Gould', 'mesmerized', 'move', 'artists', 'mathematicians', 'who', 'use', 'paper', 'folding', 'solve', 'long', 'time', 'mathematical', 'questions', 'teach', 'students', 'elementary', 'schools', 'math', 'origami', ""'ll"", 'meet', 'father', 'son', 'geniuses', 'younger', 'becoming', 'professor', 'MIT', 'age', '20', 'are', 'using', 'help', 'scientists', 'examinethe', 'forms', 'human', 'body', 'cells', 'DNA', 'son', 'may', 'even', 'someday', 'find', 'cure', 'AIDS', 'Then', 'teacher', 'who', 'integrated', 'origami', 'math', 'curriculum', 'elementary', 'schools', 'Israel', 'results', 'test', 'show', 'students', 'scores.This', 'film', 'won', 'many', 'festival', 'awards', 'deservedly', 'so.The', 'DVD', 'collection', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'favorite', 'genius', 'son', 'who', 'only', 'be', 'fun', 'as', 'well', 'six-minute', 'short', 'film', 'also', 'Gould', 'Israeli', 'school', 'program.Whether', 'appreciate', 'art', 'science', 'just', 'want', 'be', 'fascinated', 'hour', 'film', 'can', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",Independent Lens: Between the Folds

My only issue with this is one of the ""artists"" they focused on. We all know that origami is the art of *folding* paper, yet a sizable portion of this video focused on this guy who doesn't fold the paper, he kinda barely bends it (picture a pringle potato chip), and that's it.
