1440015,A11LBH38IDQNXN,B0053O8A5K,Jean M.,"[4, 5]","The first season of Glee was great.  It's off-key, witty humor and dialogue along with the strong story telling really made the show unique.  The show had a light tone to it, keeping the characters well-developped and making them likeable without any heavy drama (exept for Quinn's pregnancy).In season 2, we saw the show dip a little in quality.  Season 2 had a lot of filler episodes that didn't move the plot at all like the Rocky Horror and the Britney Spears episodes.  The major problem with season 2 was that the writing was much weaker, like the writers were running out of ideas.Now, in season three, the writing has emproved since , but now the show that was once funny and quirky is now very sentimental and overdramatic.  Glee always had sentimental moments, but season 3 is full of them.  Even though season 2 was weak, it was still funny and close to season 1.  This season feels like an after school special dealing with the ""problem of the week"".  SPOILERS AHEAD:  We deal with Kurofski trying to commit suicide, we see coach Beiste getting abused by her boyfriend and we see Quinn get into an accident from texting while driving and has to deal being in a wheel chair. And lets not forget the storyline where Ms. Cochrane and Puck have a fling and kiss in one of the earlier episodes.  Even the songs are different.  For the first 6 episodes, we don't get anything but show tunes from Broadway musicals, then, regular music comes back after.  Season 3 isn't terrible, it does have it's moments and it does some things right, but the show went into a completely different direction this year.  They didn't even include any major character development, because one of the problems other then the show being more dramatic is that it has too many characters at this point.  This was also a major problem is season 2.  We get introduced to 3 more characters, as though the 10+ glee kids aren't enough.  From the looks of the season 4 promos, the show looks like it is staying with this format.  If only they could go back to the quirky and witty Glee millions of people fell in love with back in 2009.  If they do that, then maybe it'll save this show.",3,Glee?

I think that says something about how much I used to love this show.However, this season was all sorts of disappointments. This show was so fun and fresh during their first two seasons, but all that faded away very quickly this past season.There is absolutely no character development throughout this season. Even for Quinn, who has had the biggest character arc on the show a part from Kurt. They start her off in a state of being a ""rocker"" and upset at the world by getting a Ryan Seacrest tattoo, dying her hair pink, having a nose ring, etc. Things that make NO SENSE.Of course the writers focus on Rachel and Finn's story-line the most (the worst part about the show). Everyone seemed to root for Rachel Berry the past 2 seasons, and wanted her to succeed. Instead, we lose the Rachel Berry we all knew to someone who hides behind her wedding with Finn and is willing to throw away her dreams because she is afraid no one will love her. We don't see the ambitious and sometimes kooky Rachel everyone fell in love with.What upsets me the most is how this season was the time for the characters who were graduating to shine, considering most won't be back, and if they are, it would be a small part in later seasons.The finale was suppose to be emotional and wrap up everyone's story-line but it did the opposite. Mercedes got about 10 seconds worth of footage simply stating she got a record contract, Mike got nothing, Puck the same, etc. It was just a mess. Of course Rachel and Finn get an hour of bouncing back and forth each other about their wedding and THEIR future. Which upsets me because that was suppose to be an emotional episode and in the end, all the fans were upset and disappointed it only focused on 2 characters.Plain and simple, this season was poorly written.I have no idea how season 4 is going to survive unless they get new writers. Instead of the show ""The Glee Project"" looking for new cast members, they should get one for new writers. As it is, they only focused on 6/14 characters. Until they find out how to successfully write for all the characters, they shouldn't be bringing new characters into the show for season 4.I know it's very hard to film and work on a show like this but instead of the writers thinking of clever things for Brittney to say, they should put all their energy into the script.",2,"Weak ""story-line"" for this season",1344211200,"08 6, 2012",2012,2449,"['Let', 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'am', 'HUGE', 'Glee', 'fan', 'even', 'flew', 'state', 'Glee', 'Live', 'Concert', '2011', 'think', 'something', 'how', 'much', 'used', 'love', 'show.However', 'season', 'was', 'sorts', 'disappointments', 'show', 'was', 'so', 'fun', 'fresh', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'faded', 'away', 'very', 'quickly', 'past', 'season.There', 'absolutely', 'character', 'development', 'season', 'Even', 'Quinn', 'who', 'had', 'biggest', 'character', 'arc', 'show', 'part', 'Kurt', 'start', 'off', 'state', 'being', 'rocker', 'upset', 'world', 'getting', 'Ryan', 'Seacrest', 'tattoo', 'dying', 'hair', 'pink', 'having', 'nose', 'ring', 'etc', 'Things', 'make', 'SENSE.Of', 'course', 'writers', 'focus', 'Rachel', 'Finn', 'story-line', 'most', 'worst', 'part', 'show', 'Everyone', 'seemed', 'root', 'Rachel', 'Berry', 'past', '2', 'seasons', 'wanted', 'succeed', 'Instead', 'lose', 'Rachel', 'Berry', 'knew', 'someone', 'who', 'wedding', 'Finn', 'willing', 'throw', 'away', 'dreams', 'afraid', 'one', 'will', 'love', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'ambitious', 'sometimes', 'kooky', 'Rachel', 'everyone', 'fell', 'love', 'with.What', 'most', 'how', 'season', 'was', 'time', 'characters', 'who', 'were', 'graduating', 'shine', 'considering', 'most', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'back', 'are', 'would', 'be', 'small', 'part', 'later', 'seasons.The', 'finale', 'was', 'suppose', 'be', 'emotional', 'wrap', 'up', 'everyone', 'story-line', 'did', 'opposite', 'Mercedes', 'got', 'about', '10', 'seconds', 'worth', 'footage', 'simply', 'stating', 'got', 'record', 'contract', 'Mike', 'got', 'nothing', 'Puck', 'same', 'etc', 'was', 'just', 'mess', 'course', 'Rachel', 'Finn', 'get', 'hour', 'bouncing', 'back', 'forth', 'other', 'wedding', 'THEIR', 'future', 'Which', 'was', 'suppose', 'be', 'emotional', 'episode', 'end', 'fans', 'were', 'upset', 'disappointed', 'only', 'focused', '2', 'characters.Plain', 'simple', 'season', 'was', 'poorly', 'written.I', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'season', '4', 'going', 'survive', 'get', 'new', 'writers', 'Instead', 'show', 'Glee', 'Project', 'looking', 'new', 'cast', 'members', 'should', 'get', 'one', 'new', 'writers', 'only', 'focused', '6/14', 'characters', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'successfully', 'write', 'characters', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'bringing', 'new', 'characters', 'show', 'season', '4.I', 'know', 'very', 'hard', 'film', 'work', 'show', 'instead', 'writers', 'thinking', 'clever', 'things', 'Brittney', 'say', 'should', 'put', 'energy', 'script']",Glee: Season 3

1440019,A136MAOWGCU2C2,B0053O8A5K,K.T. May,"[10, 13]","Lauren Hoffman recently wrote a perfectly critical review on Vulture.com of the season three finale of Glee which, let's face it, is the final episode for most of us. Despite promises of most of the cast's return, we know that the focus will be on the juniors who are left over from this year. Students like Tina (Jenna Ushkowitz) and Artie (Kevin McHale) will, more likely than not, see the show through to its actual end, coupled with the winners of the second season of The Glee Project. The appearances of cast members that everyone will be awaiting will be spread out thinly across the fourth season in brief cameos. The result is that we will never know when they will pop up, and that gimmick will keep us watching every week, same as I did with Jesse St. James (Jonathan Groff).I disagree with Hoffman on the season finale that it was unforgivable to see such a poignant tune (""Forever Young"") delivered by Mr. Schu (Matthew Morrison) so early in the show. I thought that was plenty appropriate, however I felt the complete lack of his presence elsewhere throughout the episode was even more unsettling. Yet Glee suffers from the addition of so many characters that to give them all a proper send-off would probably require a two-hour episode, something they could have easily done had they not already used that up the previous week with the ""Props""/""Nationals"" episodes.Not to skip ahead, but what I did find unforgivable was that the end of the episode focused entirely on Rachel's journey after high school, assuming that she is everyone's favorite and that we all want to know where she ends up. While I found Lea Michele's performance to be breathtaking when Finn delivers the news, and her immediately following rendition of ""Roots Before Branches"" to be soul-crushing, many of us effectively despise Rachel. Her character was cutthroat and annoying, and we don't care what happens to her.Not like what happens to Rachel is any surprise. She will become a washed-up theater star who abandons her dream of a successful career on Broadway in favor of raising her unplanned children or succumbing to a life of substance abuse. Whether she is to someday live out this unfulfilling existence with Finn (Cory Monteith) or not is of no moment. And since Monteith and Michele are dating in real life, it's not difficult for the ""Finchel"" lovers out there to imagine the couple's rekindling in the future.One thing Glee does rather well is its montages set to music, and I think we all would have benefitted more from seeing each of our favorite characters in a two-second glimpse into each of their futures. Kurt (Chris Colfer) got rejected from his life-long dream of going to NYADA as well. What happens to him? Kurt is a fan favorite, too. Shouldn't his fans' desires be sated as well?Why can't we see Mercedes (Amber Riley) fly off to Hollywood with Sam (Chord Overstreet), or Santana (Naya Rivera) possibly getting engaged to Brittany (Heather Morris)? Speaking of engagements, what about Emma (Jayma Mays) and Will's wedding? Ah, but that will probably be the tie-in to the fourth season as an excuse to bring back the entire cast for one last ensemble appearance.It was certainly enjoyable that there was the callback to the first episode with the ""Sit Down, You're Rocking the Boat"" scene, but in an episode that begged for as many callbacks as possible, I think we could have used as much nostalgia as possible. Clip shows are not original but they are effective, especially when this episode is essentially our last rodeo. We quite possibly will never see this full cast together again. Shouldn't we have been given the memories over which we could have properly grieved?I agree with Hoffman that Gloria Estefan was a stunt cast, as her presence was not entirely useful, although I disagree that her advice was so profound as to be necessary to the plot development. We could have learned of Santana's impending future without the celebrity reinforcement. I also agree with Hoffman that we get our first real shock at who is left in the cast when the seniors perform the New Radicals' one-hit wonder ""You Get What You Give"" to the juniors, and she brings up the excellent point that Sam is left behind. She asks how it was then legally possible for him to have been a male stripper in the ""On My Way"" episode. Continuity is more important in some instances than others. This instance was one. Hopefully, Puck (Mark Salling) was still 18 when he made out with Shelby (Idina Menzel) and nothing ever skews that logic.It was odd that in an episode that could have been emotionally jarring on so many levels, one of the best goodbyes was between Sue (Jane Lynch) and Quinn (Dianna Agron). Who would have seen that coming? Even the goodbye between Mr. Schu and Finn was lukewarm. On the parental front, we were able to squeeze in some face time with Finn's mom (Romy Rosemont) and Kurt's dad (Mike O'Malley) for good measure, despite the complete absence of Rachel's ""two gay dads"" at her graduation (Jeff Goldblum and Brian Stokes Mitchell). Her dads were discussed in more scenes than any other parent during the show's run. I guess the final budget was too low to bring them back.Another point on which to agree with Hoffman is her last. I didn't care about the characters or the plot nearly as much as I did the music, which essentially negates most of what I wrote above. However, I kept watching because knowing the backstory, no matter how thinly stretched to match the granted song list of the week (""The Rain in Spain"" in the episode ""Choke"" was painful), added a depth to the music that would not necessarily be brought out during a performance alone. That being said, this cast is the one we have followed all along, the one we knew would eventually win Nationals. I predicted how Sectionals, Regionals and Nationals would be won since season one and was not surprisingly on target every time.Now that they have won and graduated, the fire has gone out. There's nothing left to root for, except maybe Kurt and Blaine's (Darren Criss) relationship. And despite my adoration for Tina, Blaine, Rory (Damian McGinty) and the other juniors who are in for a lackluster senior year at McKinley High, if the next season finale is anything like the last, I have little or no desire to tune in again next year.",3,My thoughts on the season finale,1344902400,"08 14, 2012",2012,6323,"['Lauren', 'Hoffman', 'recently', 'wrote', 'perfectly', 'critical',

1440037,A39W3263A9HCMN,B0053O8A5K,"Renfield ""Up the Irons""","[18, 51]","When I finished Season 2 of Glee majorly disappointed, I came to the conclusion that perhaps maybe it wasn't Ryan Murphy's fault; Murphy has been struggling with co-writers coming and going since halfway through season one, and it seemed like the people who helped write the episodes couldn't understand Murphy's craft.How wrong I was. Now that there's but an episode left of Glee season 3, I'll give you this much: Ryan Murphy is indeed the biggest problem with this show.It was very telling when Murphy had both a new show and new movie in production (in other words he has a lot going on in Murphyland), and the quality of the new show (American Horror Story) was infinitely superior. It's a bad sign when I finish a TV show episode and not feel the need to tune in next week to see what happened. It's also very telling when a show has as many hiatuses as much as this did too. Major writer overhaul?Season 3 has almost zero sense of continuity. One particularly example happens when an episode ends on a major cliffhanger (Quinn ends up in a car accident as result of texting and driving). You'd expect to see a conclusion of sorts to the episode, right? Well we get a few pointless scenes of her in a wheelchair with Artie as a mind numbingly awful plot involving Plain Blanderson and his brother unfolds.What was the point of that episode anyways? Contrary to what the Gleeks may tell you, we had too much Blaine this season. Actually we had too much Blaine in... uhhh THE WHOLE SHOW. Singing breakup songs about his brother (Fighter, Somebody That I Used to Know) about his brother? Uhhh are they in an incestuous relationship?!Other problems include too many new characters being brought in then disregarded. Why this Irish Kid Rory on the show? He only had a major role in his first episode and we were forced to bear his awful Irish accent (yet he IS Irish) and his frozen Botox face. Afterward he gets reduced to a few shots per episode.in addition, song selection has been mediocre. Katy Perry? Duran Duran's weakest songs? One Direction? Seriously... WHY?!The cast seem to be bored with this show and honestly I can't blame them either. Ah well, the cast can still earn a quick buck!",1,Please keep Ryan Murphy as far away from this show as possible,1337385600,"05 19, 2012",2012,2197,"['When', 'finished', 'Season', '2', 'Glee', 'majorly', 'disappointed', 'came', 'conclusion', 'perhaps', 'maybe', 'was', ""n't"", 'Ryan', 'Murphy', 'fault', 'Murphy', 'been', 'struggling', 'co-writers', 'coming', 'going', 'halfway', 'season', 'one', 'seemed', 'people', 'who', 'helped', 'write', 'episodes', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Murphy', 'craft.How', 'wrong', 'was', 'Now', 'episode', 'left', 'Glee', 'season', '3', ""'ll"", 'give', 'much', 'Ryan', 'Murphy', 'indeed', 'biggest', 'problem', 'show.It', 'was', 'very', 'telling', 'when', 'Murphy', 'had', 'new', 'show', 'new', 'movie', 'production', 'other', 'words', 'lot', 'going', 'Murphyland', 'quality', 'new', 'show', 'American', 'Horror', 'Story', 'was', 'infinitely', 'superior', 'bad', 'sign', 'when', 'finish', 'TV', 'show', 'episode', 'not', 'feel', 'need', 'tune', 'next', 'week', 'see', 'what', 'happened', 'also', 'very', 'telling', 'when', 'show', 'as', 'many', 'hiatuses', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'too', 'Major', 'writer', 'overhaul', 'Season', '3', 'almost', 'zero', 'sense', 'continuity', 'One', 'particularly', 'example', 'when', 'episode', 'major', 'cliffhanger', 'Quinn', 'up', 'car', 'accident', 'result', 'texting', 'driving', ""'d"", 'expect', 'see', 'conclusion', 'sorts', 'episode', 'right', 'Well', 'get', 'few', 'pointless', 'scenes', 'wheelchair', 'Artie', 'mind', 'numbingly', 'awful', 'plot', 'involving', 'Plain', 'Blanderson', 'brother', 'unfolds.What', 'was', 'point', 'episode', 'Contrary', 'what', 'Gleeks', 'may', 'tell', 'had', 'too', 'much', 'Blaine', 'season', 'Actually', 'had', 'too', 'much', 'Blaine', 'THE', 'WHOLE', 'SHOW', 'Singing', 'breakup', 'songs', 'brother', 'Fighter', 'Somebody', 'Used', 'Know', 'brother', 'Uhhh', 'are', 'incestuous', 'relationship', 'Other', 'problems', 'include', 'too', 'many', 'new', 'characters', 'being', 'brought', 'then', 'disregarded', 'Why', 'Irish', 'Kid', 'Rory', 'show', 'only', 'had', 'major', 'role', 'first', 'episode', 'were', 'forced', 'bear', 'awful', 'Irish', 'accent', 'yet', 'Irish', 'frozen', 'Botox', 'face', 'reduced', 'few', 'shots', 'episode.in', 'addition', 'song', 'selection', 'been', 'mediocre', 'Katy', 'Perry', 'Duran', 'Duran', 'weakest', 'songs', 'One', 'Direction', 'Seriously', 'WHY', 'cast', 'seem', 'be', 'bored', 'show', 'honestly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'Ah', 'well', 'cast', 'can', 'still', 'earn', 'quick', 'buck']",Glee: Season 3
