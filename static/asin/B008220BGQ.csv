When Cam Brady (Will) and Marty Huggins (Zach) are steered by two brothers that have no interests in the state of South Carolina, only their own Chinese company, it gets messy.  All the usual political pitfalls are brought to play along with a few new concepts.  Kids to adults should get a few laughs, but I too agree they could have reduced the cursing a little as it didn't add any significant value to the experience, and it reduces the audience it will get.  The DVD/Prime release comes on the heels of the 2012 presidential campaign which made it all the more entertaining.

Smack dab in the middle of a huge political season and a vote to determine the future of our country right around the corner, ""The Campaign"" takes politics and humiliates it. Though as much as the joke is about politics, the joke may be on the people or the voters even more. Most of the gimmicks in the movie ring true, although taken to the extreme. Much of it shows how the way we vote, is not beyond ridicule.Will Ferrell plays Cam Brady, an incumbent congressmen who is running unopposed and is backed by big money. Despite scandals galore, he continues to be voted in, and this time he is running unopposed. That is until a big money corporation decides to create a candidate that will do their bidding. That is where Marty Huggins comes in. He is a weird guy. The only thing that makes him feasible is a father with a political background. They reshape his life and mold him to their liking. He can be manipulated and Brady and his scandals are ripe for the takedown.""The Campaign"" is reality taken to the extreme. As much as the gimmicks in the film are over-the-top, ridiculous at times and sophomoric, they are all realities. Watching the movie is refreshing to laugh at the things that we complain about on a daily basis but also like wearing egg on your face because we buy into the political gimmicks. The political environment has become a schoolyard slap fight and ""The Campaign"" takes that fight to the extreme. The canned speeches, the blame game, the bought and sold candidates, the background politics, the poll numbers going up and down based on scandals and sound bites, and the lack of honesty are all fair game.For me, the movie hit home as a testament to the deteriorated nature of politics. Don't get me wrong, this is an exaggerated comedy and it is raunchy and revealing at times and I found myself laughing throughout. Yet, as much as it is a really good comedy, it is also a social commentary on how ridiculous we've allowed elections to become and how far we have to go to retrieve some sort of honesty and dignity in politics.

Funny as these two are, the show is almost stolen by their respective campaign managers: Jason Sudeikis, playing it straight and probably being the most relatable, likable guy here (it may be the accent); and especially Dylan McDermott as the ace killer Tim Wattley (basically an updated Gordon Gekko, but in politics).  Also nice to see, as always, is Brian Cox as Marty's father.  And kudus to Lithgow and Akroyd, two comedy vets who still know how to do it right.Overall, THE CAMPAIGN is a satisfyingly-amusing comedy.  It's got some belly-aching scenes, and a few others that fall flat, and a nice moral core that helps save it from utter forgetfulness (how many films of this sort do you simply not remember seeing?).  It's not as good as the two stars have delivered (ANCHORMAN and THE HANGOVER come to mind), and even Roach's first AUSTIN POWERS film was funnier (hell, maybe even the second one), but if you want to spend the evening with a few friends and some popcorn, you could do worse.",4,"Not as good as it could've been, but still very funny.",1351468800,"10 29, 2012",2012,1854,"['Cam', 'Brady', 'Ferrell', 'been', 'running', 'Congress', 'position', 'unopposed', 'When', 'pair', 'greedy', 'businessmen', 'brothers', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'Dan', 'Akroyd', 'decide', 'Cam', 'no', 'longer', 'guy', 'want', 'buy', 'off', 'choose', 'local', 'businessman', 'Marty', 'Huggins', 'Galifianakis', 'run', 'Hilarity', 'two', 'candidates', 'face', 'other', 'question', 'purpose', 'whole', 'campaign.THE', 'CAMPAIGN', 'funny', 'have', ""n't"", 'truly', 'enjoyed', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'movie', 'time', 'Galifianakisis', 'film', 'work', 'been', 'hit-and-miss', 'so', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'how', 'amusing', 'film', 'lot', 'credit', 'director', 'who', 'proven', 'AUSTIN', 'POWERS', 'films', 'how', 'handle', 'gross-out', 'humor', 'slapstick', 'Still', 'Ferrell', 'Galifianakis', 'who', 'carry', 'most', 'burden', 'here', 'bringing', 'little', 'depth', 'nuance', 'hijinks', 'Funny', 'two', 'are', 'show', 'almost', 'stolen', 'respective', 'campaign', 'managers', 'Jason', 'Sudeikis', 'playing', 'straight', 'probably', 'being', 'most', 'relatable', 'likable', 'guy', 'here', 'may', 'be', 'accent', 'especially', 'Dylan', 'McDermott', 'ace', 'killer', 'Tim', 'Wattley', 'basically', 'updated', 'Gordon', 'Gekko', 'politics', 'Also', 'nice', 'see', 'always', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'Marty', 'father', 'kudus', 'Lithgow', 'Akroyd', 'two', 'comedy', 'vets', 'who', 'still', 'know', 'how', 'do', 'right.Overall', 'CAMPAIGN', 'satisfyingly-amusing', 'comedy', 'got', 'belly-aching', 'scenes', 'few', 'others', 'fall', 'flat', 'nice', 'moral', 'core', 'save', 'utter', 'forgetfulness', 'how', 'many', 'films', 'sort', 'do', 'simply', 'not', 'remember', 'seeing', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'two', 'stars', 'have', 'delivered', 'ANCHORMAN', 'THE', 'HANGOVER', 'come', 'mind', 'even', 'Roach', 'first', 'AUSTIN', 'POWERS', 'film', 'was', 'funnier', 'hell', 'maybe', 'even', 'second', 'one', 'want', 'spend', 'evening', 'few', 'friends', 'popcorn', 'could', 'do', 'worse']",The Campaign

1542237,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B008220BGQ,Ed Uyeshima,"[6, 11]","If not for the hilarious turns from stars Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis, this raucous 2012 comedy would be another toothless satire about our current political system. There is something fierce about the fearlessness in their play-acting that makes you wish the screenplay by Chris Henchy and Shawn Harwell had gone for the jugular a lot more than it does under Jay Roach's (Meet the Parents) pedestrian direction. Ironically, Roach directed two sharp-eyed HBO films, the recent Sarah Palin-skewering pageantGame Changeand the Bush-Gore hanging chad sagaRecount, both of which clearly brought forth the Machiavellian nature of the electoral process within the context of actual political history. Without real-life events to guide him, Roach retreats into a big-screen version of aSaturday Night Live-style sketch comedy with plenty of sight gags but frankly not enough jabs at the current bewildering state of political advertising.Ferrell plays Cam Brady, a four-term congressman from North Carolina's fictional 14th district, who runs unopposed until a crude phone message he left for his mistress gets broadcast to the media. This act motivates the powerful Motch brothers, who are driven to build an economic dynasty in the district, to find the only candidate they could find at the last minute, Marty Huggins, a small-town travel agent who happens to be the unintended scion of a longtime political family in the state. Initially inept as a politician, Huggins gets groomed by campaign manager Tim Wattley to reshape Huggins' life completely. The movie then becomes a series of one-upmanship between Huggins and Brady that escalates into backstabbing tawdriness. These scenes are particularly hilarious, for instance, Brady's butchering of ""The Lord's Prayer"" during the first debate, Huggins being connected in Brady's commercials to Saddam Hussein just because of his moustache (shades of Trump's birthing campaign), and Brady's baby-punching gaffe (repeated over and over again in faux-news coverage).My favorite scene is a throwaway montage where the Huggins family takes a break and reverts to their Twinkie-swilling, pug-caressing ways for one evening. As funny as these episodes are, I was hoping there would be a sharper political edge to the comedy. It all feels a few steps behind the surreal realities of the current presidential campaign, meaning provocative parody appears intentionally bypassed for a risk-free gag-fest, one that doesn't linger that long in the memory. Ferrell and Galifianakis easily deliver all the expected laughs as Brady and Huggins, although when the film gives off a whiff of pathos (e.g., Brady's meltdown in the office), the film simply feels off. Dylan McDermott is effectively slimy as Wattley, while Dan Ackroyd and John Lithgow have a good time playing the erudite Motch brothers (recalling the Duke brothers from Ackroyd's 1983 comedy with Eddie Murphy,Trading Places). Personally, I got tired of Karen Maruyama's running gag as a maid faking a Deep South accent, but Katherine LaNasa and Sarah Baker were quite good as the campaign wives.

They can bare the ugliness of a situation for all to see and yet not be ugly itself. They can make you think, make you laugh, give you a clearer understanding of the world around you, or be just plain wacky fun. This movie does none of that.Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it. Kind of. It has its moments, but they are few and far between. It's just that it is so utterly forgettable. It's not awful enough to make me laugh at how bad it is and it's not good enough to make much of an impact. It sought to lampoon the corruption and baleful nature of the modern American campaigning process but instead made the characters so over the top that they never seem plausible even in their own world. Example: A congressman gets caught having an affair in a porta-john in the middle of the day, gets caught making filthy phone calls to his mistress, and PUNCHES A BABY and he still has a chance of winning because he claims his opponent has facial hair like Saddam Hussein? I found myself thinking, ""no one would ever take these idiots seriously"" and ""are every one of their constituents mentally retarded?"". I was never quite able to believe the characters really meant to act the way they did and so couldn't suspend my disbelief enough to accept the world the movie took place in.Two things intrigued me and they had little to do with the movie. One, during a scene in which the underdog's campaign manager is trying to teach him how to be manlier, you can see Burt Reynolds guest starring in what appears to be an episode of ""The Commish"". I really want to watch that episode now. Two, did Dan Aykroyd realize the irony of he and John Lithgow playing the exact same types of characters as the bad guys from his 80s hit ""Trading Places""?For a better take on this kind of subject matter, two movies worth watching are ""Wag the Dog and ""Man of the Year"". The first was well ahead of its time as it was made in the late 90s but seemed to point a finger at the administrative foibles of the early 2000s and the second is a fun and interesting look at what would happen if someone like John Stewart were to take his fan's advice and run for office.

In some ways, Marty Huggins (Zach Galifianakis), the unassuming tour guide, could have been a character out of ""Family Guy"" (maybe Cleveland), or even Peter Griffin (with a few tweaks) himself.  Marty is a common man urged, especially by his distant, gruff father Raymond (Brian Cox) to throw his hat into the ring against the North Carolinian 14th district's slick but vapid 5-time elected senator Cam Brady (Will Ferrell), a cross between John Edwards, George W. Bush, and, surprisingly (to me), New England Patriot quarterback Tom Brady (must be the last name).  What follows for the rest of the movie is among the dirtiest, mud-slingingest, outrageous political rivalries ever set to film.  Seth is probably eating his heart out (unless he was one of ""The Campaign""'s writers).I'll try not to describe the plot too intricately.  The other posters preceding me have done a wonderfully complete job.  Instead, I'll try to give some idea of the satire's scope, which extends far beyond the political, which is practically everybody.  Christians, evangelicals, atheists, snake worshippers, outsourcing, unscrupulous organizations, gun nuts, children's books masquerading as communist manifestos, sex tapes, drunken joy rides, illegal immigrants, even babies and cute dogs - they all get parodied.  Much of the time, the satire penetrates the target; other times it's a little too strident and awkward.  Most of the time, though, I think you'll laugh, unless graphic profanity and images offend you (do NOT bring the kiddies).However, the biggest parody in the movie falls on the gullible public (aka, us), who eats this political swill and disinformation up.  It seems that the more offensive the accusation either candidate puts out, the more beneficial it is to his campaign! Nevertheless, the movie (and both Cam and Marty) realize there is a limit to the chicanery.  With Cam, it's his borderline pornographic campaign video ad; concomitantly, with Marty, it's realizing that his willingness to listen to his campaign handler's sleazy pointers has led to his wife ""contributing"" to that pornographic video ad.  Marty may have his idiosyncrasies, but he's not stupid.  But is he courageous enough to run his campaign based on the truth?  Can the truth actually help him win?""The Campaign"" is a well-timed, sharp poke in the eye to our political system and citizen's values.  It even has a slogan (devised by Marty) that appropriately speaks to our state affairs ""I'm bringing my broom...because it's a mess"".  I kinda have a feeling Romney and Ryan will be borrowing that slogan pretty soon, and demonstrating that ""The Campaign"" may turn out to be not a ""Politicians Gone Wild"" production, but actually a real-life political documentary!",4,Did Seth McFarlane (Family Guy) Have a Hand in This?,1344816000,"08 13, 2012",2012,2910,"['just', 'occurred', 'Campaign', 'boisterous', 'pedal-to-the-floor', 'wall-to-wall', 'political', 'satire', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'inspired', 'Seth', 'McFarlane', 'Family', 'Guy', 'ways', 'Marty', 'Huggins', 'Zach', 'Galifianakis', 'unassuming', 'tour', 'guide', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'character', 'Family', 'Guy', 'maybe', 'Cleveland', 'even', 'Peter', 'Griffin', 'few', 'tweaks', 'Marty', 'common', 'man', 'urged', 'especially', 'distant', 'gruff', 'father', 'Raymond', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'throw', 'hat', 'ring', 'North', 'Carolinian', '14th', 'district', 'slick', 'vapid', '5-time', 'elected', 'senator', 'Cam', 'Brady', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'cross', 'John', 'Edwards', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'surprisingly', 'New', 'England', 'Patriot', 'quarterback', 'Tom', 'Brady', 'must', 'be', 'last', 'name', 'What', 'rest', 'movie', 'dirtiest', 'mud-slingingest', 'outrageous', 'political', 'rivalries', 'ever', 'set', 'film', 'Seth', 'probably', 'eating', 'heart', 'out', 'was', 'one', 'Campaign', 'writers', '.I', ""'ll"", 'try', 'not', 'describe', 'plot', 'too', 'intricately', 'other', 'posters', 'preceding', 'have', 'done', 'wonderfully', 'complete', 'job', 'Instead', ""'ll"", 'try', 'give', 'idea', 'satire', 'scope', 'far', 'political', 'practically', 'everybody', 'Christians', 'evangelicals', 'atheists', 'snake', 'worshippers', 'outsourcing', 'unscrupulous', 'organizations', 'gun', 'nuts', 'children', 'books', 'masquerading', 'communist', 'manifestos', 'sex', 'tapes', 'drunken', 'joy', 'rides', 'illegal', 'immigrants', 'even', 'babies', 'cute', 'dogs', 'get', 'parodied', 'Much', 'time', 'satire', 'target', 'other', 'times', 'little', 'too', 'strident', 'awkward', 'Most', 'time', 'think', ""'ll"", 'laugh', 'graphic', 'profanity', 'images', 'offend', 'do', 'NOT', 'bring', 'kiddies', '.However', 'biggest', 'parody', 'movie', 'gullible', 'public', 'aka', 'who', 'political', 'swill', 'disinformation', 'up', 'more', 'offensive', 'accusation', 'candidate', 'out', 'more', 'beneficial', 'campaign', 'Nevertheless', 'movie', 'Cam', 'Marty', 'realize', 'limit', 'chicanery', 'Cam', 'borderline', 'pornographic', 'campaign', 'video', 'ad', 'concomitantly', 'Marty', 'realizing', 'willingness', 'listen', 'campaign', 'handler', 'sleazy', 'pointers', 'led', 'wife', 'contributing', 'pornographic', 'video', 'ad', 'Marty', 'may', 'have', 'idiosyncrasies', 'not', 'stupid', 'courageous', 'enough', 'run', 'campaign', 'based', 'truth', 'Can', 'truth', 'actually', 'win', 'Campaign', 'well-timed', 'sharp', 'poke', 'eye', 'political', 'system', 'citizen', 'values', 'even', 'slogan', 'devised', 'Marty', 'appropriately', 'state', 'affairs', ""'m"", 'bringing', 'broom', 'mess', 'kinda', 'have', 'feeling', 'Romney', 'Ryan', 'will', 'be', 'borrowing', 'slogan', 'pretty', 'soon', 'demonstrating', 'Campaign', 'may', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'not', 'Politicians', 'Gone', 'Wild', 'production', 'actually', 'real-life', 'political', 'documentary']",The Campaign

Not only is Will Ferrell one of my favorite movie comedians but everything I've seen from Zach Galifianakis has been hilarious. However, after watching it yesterday I must say I was a little underwhelmed. This movie is definitely filled with laughs, but they aren't consistent. And when you put these two in a movie together consistency is key.I'm not going to waste your time by describing the plot because you've most likely read it dozens of times before. If not, the cover makes it obvious. Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis are competing against each other in a political campaign. Will Ferrell plays his role perfectly and it feels like he was made for this part. Zach Galifianakis on the other hand.... It feels like directors are purposely making every character he plays extremely feminine and hypersensitive. Honestly it's starting to get a little old. We saw him play a human man child in The Hangover and the extremely feminine Ethan in Due Date. It's time to let him play some normal roles.As a whole I felt like the focus was more on the bashing politicians than it was on the comedy. Which, don't get me wrong, I'm all for the bashing of dirty politicians, but as I said before with the two of these in a comedy together the comedy needed to be the main focus. Easily the funniest parts were with Karen Maruyama as Mrs. Yao, a maid who talks with an urban accent. Dylan McDermott (Tim Wattley) and Jason Sudeikis (Mitch Wilson) both gave great performances. To tell you the truth I think this has to be my favorite performance from Jason Sudeikis so far. I've seen him in a couple of other movies and I didn't really enjoy his acting. He did a good job here though.Overall Score: 6/10 - I was really excited for this, but the movie just feels flat. It definitely had a lot of potential, but the end result is kind of underwhelming.

We also enjoyed the many sharp shots at the corruption and flat out thievery now endemic in American politics. They even mentioned Citizens United! If only more people would speak up about the sick corruption of that law, which has made the buying and selling of our politicians fully legal. (Or at least finally official.)The Campaign goes after that entire concept and hits a few bullseyes, certainly with the Motch/Koch Brothers, over the top tv ads, and just the criminality of it all in general. I love that at least someone is trying to wake folks up, and what better way than with a sharp comedy?Unfortunately, Zach, who I often love, is the weak link here, despite some highlights. His character is just his onstage ""twin"" Seth that he's used for years, and he could have been better adapted to this material. Compared to Will, he's a weak sister.But Ferrell is classic in many scenes, truly hilarious; the guy just has that magic whatever it is that makes someone funny just to look at. Few have ever played shifty dimwits with more flair and comedy than Ferrell, no doubt. McDermott is also spot on and really makes his character come alive. Aykroyd kind of reprises his Trading Places role, if backwards. Most of the other folks are likewise good enough, and Sudeikis shows again that he and Parnell are the cream of the SNL crop since Ferrell left for understated comic genius. I'd love to see those two together with Will on the big screen one day soon.The blu-ray has a nice transfer but picture quality isn't very vital to enjoy this, and the only extras are some hit and miss deleted scenes. No outtakes?! No nothing else? Kind of weak for the price tag. Get the dvd instead.All in all, The Campaign is worth seeing not just for Ferrell but to remind ourselves how bad things really are now, and how blithely we accept it while doing so little to change it. When will the real outrage at the endemic corruption kick in? Ever? Better be soon, before we're all taxed and debted into oblivion.This film will play well as the years go by, in any case. Let's pray it's as a postscript to this era of total corruption, and not as prelude to something worse.

Power ""nlp trainer""","[8, 13]","It's fair to say that both Will Ferrell and Zack Galifiniakis are in top form in this excellent comedy whose release coincides with the Presidential Election campaign.Ferrell excels in playing over the top alpha male type characters, and his years of impersonating Bush for example on SNL pays off handsomely in this entertaining romp, because he truly can adopt that type of presence.I was half expecting another formulaic comedy, yet the writer dials up the absurdity from the get go, sending up the political election process, and I am sure it will appeal to people of all persuasions, and foul is fair in this campaign.Cam Brady, career congressman runs unopposed for reelection until two billionaire businessman decide to put up an unlikely opposing candidate.  But can an unlikely nave nobody transform into a ruthless political somebody, or will he be eaten alive by the sophisticated political machine of one Cam Brady?Ferrell plays Cam Brady, and Zack plays Marty Huggins who is a little odd, and definitely not your political type.  He likes to walk his (Chinese) pugs, but when he gets a campaign manager and image consultant, he has to get labradors because they are more American and they test through the roof.His wife has to get a Katie Couric haircut.Some of the funniest pieces are the political ads, which absurdify the negative campaign ads we often see, and are laugh out loud funny.  I also like the squaring off before they do the political debate where they do the dominant hand shake, and the stare-down, and the under the breath trash talk.  If you're like me you will be amazed at the antics these two resort to to get ahead in the ratings.

El-Hewie""","[8, 36]","As I watch at least two movies per evening during Summer, I combined The Campaign withThe Bourne Legacy, perfect contrast of seriously minded moviemaking in the latter, versus a trashy low level comedy in the former. It is a shame that a moviemaker resorts to profanity, sleazy jokes, and cheep tricks in order to entertain the underworld of mediocrity.All actors possessed the skill to do better and refine their performance, except the lousy scenario which was bent on injecting childish profanity at every corner of the scenes. Some movies did well despite their heavy content of profanity, such asNeighborhood Watch, but that requires specially capable actors to justify the use of profanity for extreme humor supported by innocuous intent. You need to feel that the character was compelled to resort to profanity, not forcing profanity for the sake of faking cuteness.The main theme in the movie was the planning of election campaigns based on fooling the public to pick the candidate with few sticking themes such as invoking Jesus, freedom, and jobs. To finance such campaign planning, the wealthy business men buy the favorite candidate who could help in-source American jobs by building Chinese factories in America with Chinese laborers in order to save the cost of shipping while paying less for foreign labor.The four-term incumbent and the party to those greedy business men could not live straight responsible life and must be replaced by anyone who could conform to the plans of the greedy business men.The choices of the two candidates was perfect, as one candidate lived recklessly and childishly to the extreme, the other was a naive common man hiding in the grooves of society unnoticed and irrelevant to it.No ugly epithet and profane thought was off limit, to the extent of wasting the talents of the actors and the viewers.Mohamed F.

Will Ferrell is at his cornpone best as a 6 term congressman who again expects to run unopposed.  He makes a series of blunders that begin to concern his supporters.  Needless to say, they involve some profane and sexual comments and actions.A pair of super rich brothers (a thinly veiled take on the Koch brothers) played by Dan Aykroyd and John Lithgow sees an opportunity to unseat Cam Brady (Ferrell).  They need someone they can count on to relax hiring standards to build a Chinese-like sweatshop in Brady's district in North Carolina.  Through a local connection, Raymond Huggins (Brian Cox), his son Marty (Zach Galifianakis) is drafted to challenge Cam.  Marty is a dufus who runs a tour bus that takes visitors around the town. But the brothers send a political expert (very good Dylan McDermott) to run the campaign.Marty is married with 2 boys.  Perhaps the best scene in the film takes place around the dinner table (think Ferrell's ""Talladega Nights"") when Marty and his family pause to volunteer sinful activities they have done that might come up in the campaign.  Unfortunately, the trailers give away some of the dialog, but the really raunchy stuff comes here from the mouths of the kids.  I was laughing so hard, it brought tears to my eyes.  Hopefully the home video (DVD, Blu ray) will include more of these bits.While the writers and the Ferrell/Galifianakis duo pretty much deliver non-stop brilliant stupidity, some of the jokes do fall flat.  Perhaps the satire is also focused on the voters rather than the politicians.  Certainly, `tweets' of sex organs and thousand dollar haircuts will ring familiar, but many of the faux pas actually improve the candidate's popularity.  For example, when Brady puts out some obscene ads, his ratings go up.  When Marty pulls out a weapon, his ratings go up.  This isn't a perfect movie (few are) but there are enough hilarious scenes to make it worthwhile.  It is mean-spirited, raunchy, profane, vulgar, shameless and offensive.

The trailers and marketing for The Campaign had me thinking it was going to be another big miss from the Will Ferrell comedy output, and about five minutes in I was already regretting my decision to give it a shot. Ferrell seemed to be doing his usual routine, while his co-lead Zach Galifianakis was basically just playing a slightly altered version of his alter-ego Seth that he uses in his stand-up routine. About half an hour into the film though, I began to realize that I was actually having a decent time with it.The narrative, about two stooges going up against each other for a North Carolina congressional seat, isn't anything fancy and is used mostly as a platform to get these two actors to go against one another. Unfortunately, especially given its increased topicality in the current year, the opportunity for political satire isn't used to its full advantage here by any stretch. It's surprising, given the fact that they assigned director award-winning director Jay Roach, that the film doesn't really concern itself with saying too much about the politics of it all. John Lithgow and Dan Aykroyd portray thinly veiled versions of the real-life Koch brothers, but aside from that there isn't much in the way of any kind of commentary on the current political climate, which feels like a missed opportunity when you have the director of Recount and Game Change at the helm.The Campaign won't do anything for you on an intellectual level and as far as the comedy goes, it certainly isn't as inventive as Step Brothers, warm-hearted as I Love You, Man or full-on hilarious as The Other Guys, but it settles itself into a comfortable lesser area where the chuckles come often and the whole experience is easy to digest. There weren't really any moments where I found myself wishing things would go by quicker or reach the inevitable, and very hokey, conclusion.Ferrell and Galifianakis do things we've seen them both do countless times, yet I was surprised by how they were able to keep working in that same area without me getting sick of them. Lithgow and Aykroyd are a fun pair that are unfortunately wasted with very little screen time, but the biggest surprise of the cast is actually Dylan McDermott, who proves himself to be an impressively skilled comedic actor here. I've never thought much of the actor prior to this, but he comes along and steals the entire movie out from under the headlining stars, with every moment of his being more valuable than just about anything else in the picture.The Campaign has the occasional moment that got me to laugh with some extra punch, such as a dinner table confessional with the family of the Galifianakis character, but mostly it's just a light and easy comedy that won't leave much on the mind but won't torture you either. There's a lot of missed opportunities, but for what it is this is a safe and mildly pleasurable experience.",3,BIG TALENT - BAD SCRIPT,1353110400,"11 17, 2012",2012,2959,"['was', 'probably', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'had', 'right', 'be', 'trailers', 'marketing', 'Campaign', 'had', 'thinking', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'big', 'miss', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'comedy', 'output', 'five', 'minutes', 'was', 'already', 'regretting', 'decision', 'give', 'shot', 'Ferrell', 'seemed', 'be', 'doing', 'usual', 'routine', 'co-lead', 'Zach', 'Galifianakis', 'was', 'basically', 'just', 'playing', 'slightly', 'altered', 'version', 'alter-ego', 'Seth', 'stand-up', 'routine', 'hour', 'film', 'began', 'realize', 'was', 'actually', 'having', 'decent', 'time', 'it.The', 'narrative', 'about', 'two', 'stooges', 'going', 'up', 'other', 'North', 'Carolina', 'congressional', 'seat', ""n't"", 'anything', 'fancy', 'used', 'mostly', 'platform', 'get', 'two', 'actors', 'go', 'one', 'Unfortunately', 'especially', 'given', 'increased', 'topicality', 'current', 'year', 'opportunity', 'political', 'satire', ""n't"", 'used', 'full', 'advantage', 'here', 'stretch', 'surprising', 'given', 'fact', 'assigned', 'director', 'award-winning', 'director', 'Jay', 'Roach', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'concern', 'saying', 'too', 'much', 'politics', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'portray', 'thinly', 'veiled', 'versions', 'real-life', 'Koch', 'brothers', 'aside', ""n't"", 'much', 'way', 'kind', 'commentary', 'current', 'political', 'climate', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'when', 'have', 'director', 'Recount', 'Game', 'Change', 'helm.The', 'Campaign', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'intellectual', 'level', 'as', 'far', 'comedy', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'as', 'inventive', 'Step', 'Brothers', 'warm-hearted', 'Love', 'full-on', 'hilarious', 'Other', 'Guys', 'comfortable', 'lesser', 'area', 'where', 'chuckles', 'come', 'often', 'whole', 'experience', 'easy', 'digest', 'were', ""n't"", 'really', 'moments', 'where', 'found', 'wishing', 'things', 'would', 'go', 'quicker', 'reach', 'inevitable', 'very', 'hokey', 'conclusion.Ferrell', 'Galifianakis', 'do', 'things', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'do', 'countless', 'times', 'yet', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'were', 'able', 'keep', 'working', 'same', 'area', 'getting', 'sick', 'Lithgow', 'Aykroyd', 'are', 'fun', 'pair', 'are', 'unfortunately', 'wasted', 'very', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'biggest', 'surprise', 'cast', 'actually', 'Dylan', 'McDermott', 'who', 'be', 'impressively', 'skilled', 'comedic', 'actor', 'here', ""'ve"", 'never', 'thought', 'much', 'actor', 'prior', 'along', 'entire', 'movie', 'headlining', 'stars', 'moment', 'being', 'more', 'valuable', 'just', 'anything', 'else', 'picture.The', 'Campaign', 'occasional', 'moment', 'got', 'laugh', 'extra', 'punch', 'such', 'dinner', 'table', 'confessional', 'family', 'Galifianakis', 'character', 'mostly', 'just', 'light', 'easy', 'comedy', 'wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'much', 'mind', 'wo', ""n't"", 'torture', 'either', 'lot', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'what', 'safe', 'mildly', 'pleasurable', 'experience']",The Campaign

Many times? I sure do. And, unfortunately, we are often correct.Comedy is hard. What makes people laugh is often so subjective.I made this comment after watching the trailer for ""The Campaign"", the new comedy starring Will Ferrell and Zach Galiafinakis. Given Ferrell's recent track record, I had no reason to think otherwise.So, I was surprised by ""The Campaign"". It is pretty consistently funny and much better than you might expect.Cam Brady (Ferrell), the unopposed, incumbent Democratic Congressman who represents a small district in North Carolina, is a born politician, willing to do and say anything for your vote. When a sex scandal looms, he doesn't give it much thought. He is extremely popular and doesn't really care. Even his wife seems to disregard the scandal; Cam is being considered for a Vice Presidential run and she can't wait to be Second Lady. But the Mocht Brothers (John Lithgow and Dan Akroyd) are disappointed with the profits from their Chinese Toy factory; the child labor earns too much and then they have to pay to ship the product to the United States. So they want to have a significant portion of North Carolina rezoned so they can build a massive factory, import Chinese child labor and save on the shipping. But Cam won't sign on prompting them to find a candidate to run against the incumbent. They zero in on Marty Huggins (Galiafinakis), the son of a former North Carolina congressman, who runs a small tourist agency. They send Tim Wattley (Dylan McDermott) to run Marty's campaign and he immediately begins turning the new candidate's life upside down. Marty is initially resistant to the changes, but begins to catch on and prove to be a formidable candidate.Directed by Jay Roach (""Austin Powers"") and written by Shawn Harwell (""Eastbound and Down"") and Chris Henchy (""Land of the Lost""), ""The Campaign"" may seem like a typical Will Ferrell film, but it has a lot more going for it. More laughs, more satire, more dark humor and it has something to say. All of this contributes to help make the film something worth watching.Ferrell is clearly channeling his George W. impersonation. From the moment we first meet Cam, we realize he is a career politician, willing to say and do whatever it takes to maintain his power, his image, his place in Washington. As the Democratic incumbent, he sees his district as his personal tool box; he can play with anyone and anything he pleases. But Ferrell reveals more layers to Cam's character making him more interesting than the typical man-boy who refuses to grow up so often portrayed by the comedian. When Cam runs unopposed, Mitch (Jason Sudeikis, ""Horrible Bosses""), his campaign manager, has to make a few calls to cover up his boss' frequent missteps.And when Marty enters the picture, you can see the momentary indecision cross his face. What should he do? Is Marty an obstacle and if so, how can he overcome it? It doesn't take Cam very long to remember all of the tricks and trades of being a politician and he soon kicks into high gear, providing a little bit of 'shock and awe' for his wet-behind-the-ears opponent.One of the best things about ""The Campaign"" is watching the change in Galiafinakis' character. Initially, he decides to run because he wants to help preserve his district. As soon as he agrees, the Mocht brothers send in Wattley, to mold and shape Marty into a candidate the American voter can get behind. Marty, his wife and two kids, don't understand why their life has to change but Cam instantly criticizes his two small Pugs, his ""Chinese"" dogs, and when this becomes a campaign issue, Tim changes the dogs and photographs the family with two all American dogs.Galiafinakis imbues Marty with the perfect amount of doe-eyed innocence and a strange, affected accent, both of which make him instantly strange and unusual. But as he realizes what is necessary to win the campaign, a reality hits and his demeanor begins to change. Throughout, you can see the new and old Marty fighting for dominance, fighting to take over.But Roach does a very interesting thing with the two leads. As you watch all of this going on in Marty's life, you realize Cam has already gone through all of this. Watching Marty gives us insight into Cam's life and character. It is like watching two different stages of the same character concurrently.Dylan McDermott is a real surprise. As Tim Wattley, the professional campaign manager sent in by the Mocht brothers, he insinuates himself into Marty's life in a funny and unexpected way, popping up behind or near Marty and his wife whenever he feels like something is going off track. He also seems barely able to control his disappointment in Marty, a fact that barely seems to register with the virgin candidate.Jason Sudeikis is the straight man to Ferrell's Cam and doesn't generate a lot of laughs.Sarah Baker (TV's ""Go On""), who plays Mitzi, Marty's wife is a standout. She experiences the same things her husband goes through, but gives us an idea of what the wife goes through. And she provides a good sounding board for all of Marty's strangeness.Karen Maruyama is a scene stealer as Mrs. Yao, the housekeeper for Marty's dad. Every time she appears on screen, she says something that makes you laugh. Her character is pretty un-PC but the circumstances for her behavior are very memorable..Dan Akroyd and John Lithgow play the Mocht brothers, greedy industrialists. The sequence of their tour through the Chinese toy factory is filled with some funny sight gags, which are, sadly, probably more truthful than they should be.Jay Roach has created a funny comedy which derives a lot of laughs from biting comments about our current political landscape. There are a lot of laughs, the film contains a lot of dark humor and the performances are better than average.However, the film falters in the last act because the filmmakers seem to feel it necessary to give some of the characters redeeming qualities. They have to do good, to become a good person, which detracts from the earlier dark humor, the political satire. It leaves the viewer feeling slightly wronged in a way.But because there are so many laughs, so much humor, these few Hollywood-necessary moments at the end of the film can and should be overlooked.""The Campaign"" is a funny, biting reminder of some of the worst aspects of American politics.

Much of Will Ferrell's character in the movie, Cam Brady, is carried over from previous movies. I liked Zach Galifianakis as Marty Huggins, he really played a comic humble little guy well.Actually, the movie was going well, I mean it has a meaning to it, sort of like all these 'advisors' and corrupt businessmen chip in and the ruthlessness of 'The Campaign' tears their lives apart. Marty loses time with his family, then gets separated from his wife, while Cam goes through much the same thing. By the end of it their both worn down, with some hilarious scenes in the meantime.But despite that promise, I couldn't help but shake that stench of reverse snobbery that infiltrates Hollywood comedies these days, kind of that all businessmen and middle class squares are, behind it all, bad or twisted people.

What put this film over the top and on to my radar, was it's Director, Jay Roach. He may not have name recognition, but when the man who Directed the Austin Powers and Meet The Parents trilogies releases a new comedy, I for one take notice. The Campaign is also different from most Ferrell movies, being that it has a storyline, and he is a co-star, lessening the chances of him running off on some insane hallucination. Ferrell plays four term Congressman, Cam Brady, a wildly popular brown nose, who is hated by the opposing party. He's about to get a fifth term, unopposed, when a group of millionaires decide to fiance a campaign against him, featuring the son of a legend in Washington. There's one problem though, this man's son, is a complete idiot. As the campaign rages it's the veteran politician against his haters money and both sides will go to any and all lengths to win. This movie was a million times better than I thought it would be and absolutely hysterical. The writers take the idea of a dirty campaign and bring it to the extreme, with some things that have to be seen to be believed. Zach Galifianakis doesn't disappoint, giving us perhaps his best character since Alan in the Hangover, and to give credit where credit is due, yes, Will Ferrell matched him line for line, in what was the only thing I've liked him in since Elf.

Call me a prude, call me an uptight conservative, but I would prefer to wear those monikers proudly than to even think of recommending this to anyone.This is not a family-friendly movie, as was originally thought when it first came out. I wouldn't even call it worthy of being a PG-13. While the theatrics of politics is well-known for being gratuitous, this movie went beyond that by using high school mentality antics in using nudity and sexual language, swearing, and a scene in which Ferrell's character is shown having sex with his opponents wife, albeit from a modest angle.If other Holly-weird celebrities starred in this debacle, it wouldn't have fazed me because the majority of stars have sold their souls for the price of fame. But I had hopes for Ferrell to stick to his ability to be funny without having to stoop to such a low level.Ya, I miss John Wayne, Jimmy Stewart, Barbara Stanwyck and the other real stars of years ago.

Cam Brady (Ferrell) is running for his 4th term as congressman and once again is unopposed.

They decide on the local tourism center director Marty Huggins (Galifianakis). What starts off as a joke quickly becomes more serious that anyone was expecting and the race becomes a focal point in the nation. Punching babies and dogs helped it to become that too though. As many of you know I am a pretty big Will Ferrell fan, I love his style of humor and really just enjoy watching his work. This is the first movie I've seen of his where I felt like he was almost trying too hard. He was still funny, but he was falling back a lot on his ""W"" and ""Talladega Nights"" character and to me that was a little distracting in some parts. That is the only downside I had to this movie though. Galifianakis was hilarious and the voice he used made me laugh at almost everything he was saying. The supporting cast was also perfect and this is very close to being a great comedy. The only thing keeping it from crossing into greatness to me is that the characters did seem a little overused from other movies, but if that's the worst thing about the movie that should say something.

Do you want an improvement, or would you settle for any change that came along? If so, you might enjoy this latest offering from Will Ferrell.Cam Brady (played by Ferrell) is a four term congressman who was about to run for a fifth term unopposed when, after dialing the wrong number, he leaves an explicit message for a woman other than his wife. The family who received the message released it to the press and, almost immediately, Brady's polling numbers began to decline. Elsewhere, wealthy businessmen Glen and Wade Motch (played by John Lithgow and Dan Aykroyd) were looking to increase profits by moving their Chinese factory to Brady's district while leaving the conditions (i.e. toxic work environment and low wages) the same. That way, the Motch brothers (Lithgow and Aykroyd) would save on shipping. When Glen and Wade saw the difficulties Brady was experiencing, they decided to support the son of a powerful Republican. Once he was told, Marty Huggins (played by Zach Galifianakis) agreed, filled out the proper forms and entered the race. To increase Marty's chances of winning, his campaign manager Tim Wattley (played by Dylan McDermott) gave Marty, his family and his home a complete makeover. And so began a slew of scandalous photos, unfounded accusations, and embarrassing misstatements we've come to expect from a contemporary election.Now, I have liked some of Will Ferrell's other films. The most recent example is Stranger Than Fiction where he played a solitary IRS agent who begins to hear the voice of an omnipotent narrator detailing the events of his life. As for Galifianakis, I like him as a comedian but find him lacking as an actor. The supporting cast, Lithgow, Murray, McDermott, and Brian Cox who I neglected to mention, are talented and I am a big fan of all of them. Still, I didn't enjoy this film. Ferrell and Galifianakis played characters that, while funny, were not very interesting.

Turning over this rock and exposing the crawling life forms below is almost guaranteed to get laughs. Congressional politicians are pompous, self-serving, duplicitous, and always running for election. The Campaign takes advantage of the easy heehaws these 435 useless, ineffective folks provide on a daily basis. They are the low-hanging fruit on the comedy tree only inches above potty jokes. Will Farrell and Zach Galifianakis harvest an almost non-stop, belly-full of laughs for at least 70 out of the 85 minutes. Farrell's character Cam Brady is married to his hairdo and obsessively self-assured as he embarks on another Congressional campaign. Running unopposed, he has tossed caution to the wind. He sees himself as invincible. But on the last filing day, Galifinakis' character Marty Huggins enters the race. He's sponsored by a couple of rich moguls who now view their ""boy"" Cam Brady as a liability -- time to install a new stooge politician.What follows is a rollicking campaign filled with outrageous accusations, unequivocal denials, repentant sinners and vicious winners. The movie is rich in sight gags and wisecracks. But for all these rapid-fire rim shots to generate humor, Cam Brady and Marty Huggins need a straight man -- a Bud Abbott, Dean Martin, Ed McMahon type -- the set-up guy -- the commentator -- the yang. That role in the movie is fulfilled by the same people who do it in ""real life"" -- the television news personalities: Wolf Blitzer, Chris Matthews, Dennis Miller, Piers Morgan, Bill Maher and others provide the context for the jokes. The result is a naturally funny and unpretentious political movie.Unlike 1998'sBulworthwhich was a serious comedy about a politician who outrageously decides to tell the truth, there is no point to The Campaign except the obvious -- it is easier to laugh at the spectacle of our national congressional elections than it is to change the system. Unfortunately, the joke is on those American citizens who participate in this mockery every two years. Italy may have its Beppe Grillo, a comic-turned-politician, but we are saddled with a hundreds of humorless, narcissistic, inept politicians who are archetypical buffoons. Maybe this is why this country's legislation is driven by self-serving executive orders and expedient legal decisions instead of reasoned legislation. Of the three government branches, only the fruit on the lowest branch evokes bawdy laughter. The fruit on the higher branches whether colored red, blue or purple is heavy, distasteful and bitter. We can have a good laugh at the lowlife congressmen for we realize they are only political eunuchs lacking the balls to make a difference.",4,Congressmen: Low-Hanging Fruit Dangling From the Legislative Branch,1366761600,"04 24, 2013",2013,2844,"['Poking', 'fun', 'activities', 'habits', 'behaviors', 'fine', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'form', 'Congress', 'United', 'States', 'America', 'time-honored', 'American', 'pastime', 'Turning', 'over', 'rock', 'exposing', 'crawling', 'life', 'forms', 'below', 'almost', 'guaranteed', 'get', 'laughs', 'Congressional', 'politicians', 'are', 'pompous', 'self-serving', 'duplicitous', 'always', 'running', 'election', 'Campaign', 'advantage', 'easy', 'heehaws', '435', 'useless', 'ineffective', 'folks', 'provide', 'daily', 'basis', 'are', 'low-hanging', 'fruit', 'comedy', 'tree', 'only', 'potty', 'jokes', 'Will', 'Farrell', 'Zach', 'Galifianakis', 'harvest', 'almost', 'non-stop', 'belly-full', 'laughs', 'least', '70', '85', 'minutes', 'Farrell', 'character', 'Cam', 'Brady', 'married', 'hairdo', 'obsessively', 'self-assured', 'Congressional', 'campaign', 'Running', 'unopposed', 'tossed', 'caution', 'wind', 'invincible', 'last', 'filing', 'day', 'Galifinakis', 'character', 'Marty', 'race', 'sponsored', 'couple', 'rich', 'moguls', 'who', 'now', 'view', 'boy', 'Cam', 'Brady', 'liability', 'time', 'install', 'new', 'stooge', 'politician.What', 'rollicking', 'campaign', 'filled', 'outrageous', 'accusations', 'unequivocal', 'denials', 'repentant', 'sinners', 'vicious', 'winners', 'movie', 'rich', 'sight', 'gags', 'wisecracks', 'rapid-fire', 'rim', 'shots', 'generate', 'humor', 'Cam', 'Brady', 'Marty', 'Huggins', 'need', 'straight', 'man', 'Bud', 'Abbott', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'Ed', 'McMahon', 'type', 'set-up', 'guy', 'commentator', 'yang', 'role', 'movie', 'fulfilled', 'same', 'people', 'who', 'do', 'real', 'life', 'television', 'news', 'personalities', 'Wolf', 'Blitzer', 'Chris', 'Matthews', 'Dennis', 'Miller', 'Piers', 'Morgan', 'Bill', 'Maher', 'others', 'provide', 'context', 'jokes', 'result', 'naturally', 'funny', 'unpretentious', 'political', 'movie.Unlike', ""1998'sBulworthwhich"", 'was', 'serious', 'comedy', 'politician', 'who', 'outrageously', 'tell', 'truth', 'point', 'Campaign', 'obvious', 'easier', 'laugh', 'spectacle', 'national', 'congressional', 'elections', 'change', 'system', 'Unfortunately', 'joke', 'American', 'citizens', 'who', 'participate', 'mockery', 'two', 'years', 'Italy', 'may', 'have', 'Beppe', 'Grillo', 'comic-turned-politician', 'are', 'saddled', 'hundreds', 'humorless', 'narcissistic', 'inept', 'politicians', 'who', 'are', 'archetypical', 'buffoons', 'Maybe', 'why', 'country', 'legislation', 'driven', 'self-serving', 'executive', 'orders', 'expedient', 'legal', 'decisions', 'instead', 'reasoned', 'legislation', 'three', 'government', 'branches', 'only', 'fruit', 'lowest', 'branch', 'evokes', 'bawdy', 'laughter', 'fruit', 'higher', 'branches', 'colored', 'red', 'blue', 'purple', 'heavy', 'distasteful', 'bitter', 'can', 'have', 'good', 'laugh', 'lowlife', 'congressmen', 'realize', 'are', 'only', 'political', 'eunuchs', 'lacking', 'balls', 'make', 'difference']",The Campaign
