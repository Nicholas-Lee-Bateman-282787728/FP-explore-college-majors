609979,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B00005JLZN,,"[4, 4]","'The Life of David Gale' released in '03 is an intriguing tale dealing with the pursuit of intellectual honesty, personal ambition and radical political activism. David Gale (Kevin Spacey) is a highly respected intellectual, author, college professor and anti-death penalty activist who's life falls apart after a unplanned sexual encounter with one of his students.That one brief moment of passion ends up costing him everything he holds dear. That is everything but his friendship with fellow colleage and activist Constance Harraway (Laura Linney) and their desire to give it all for their mutual cause. Eventually death and a possible murder turns out to be the end result of all their altruistic efforts.'The Life of David Gale' is a fascinating study in political zealotry, exploring just how far individuals will go to prove a point and promote a cause. After all, ""almost matyrs don't count"".Great performances by Spacey, Linney and Kate Winslet as Bitsey Bloom, the reporter who finally puts it all together.",4,"""Almost Martyrs Don't Count""  ~  How Far Would You Go For Your Beliefs?",1153094400,"07 17, 2006",2006,1017,"[""'The"", 'Life', 'David', 'Gale', 'released', ""'03"", 'intriguing', 'tale', 'dealing', 'pursuit', 'intellectual', 'honesty', 'personal', 'ambition', 'radical', 'political', 'activism', 'David', 'Gale', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'highly', 'respected', 'intellectual', 'author', 'college', 'professor', 'anti-death', 'penalty', 'activist', 'who', 'life', 'apart', 'unplanned', 'sexual', 'encounter', 'one', 'students.That', 'one', 'brief', 'moment', 'passion', 'up', 'costing', 'everything', 'dear', 'everything', 'friendship', 'fellow', 'colleage', 'activist', 'Constance', 'Harraway', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'desire', 'give', 'mutual', 'cause', 'Eventually', 'death', 'possible', 'murder', 'out', 'be', 'end', 'result', 'altruistic', 'efforts', ""'The"", 'Life', 'David', 'Gale', 'fascinating', 'study', 'political', 'zealotry', 'exploring', 'just', 'how', 'far', 'individuals', 'will', 'go', 'prove', 'point', 'promote', 'cause', 'almost', 'matyrs', 'do', ""n't"", 'count', '.Great', 'performances', 'Spacey', 'Linney', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Bitsey', 'Bloom', 'reporter', 'who', 'finally', 'together']",N/A
609980,A33NA8VLEORQRS,B00005JLZN,"Alex ""Alex""","[1, 4]","This movie looked bad from the theatrical previews, but I saw it anyway because a friend of mine wanted to check it out.  Unfortunately, I was not pleasantly surprised.The main problem with The Life of David Gale is that the ""surprise"" ending was painfully obvious after about 45 minutes, so much so that I whispered to my friend that, since I knew what was going to happen anyway, I was tempted to leave and she could tell me later that I was right.  I eneded up staying, and much to my chagrin, not only was I right, but they tried to split the surprise ending into two separate twists rather than consolidating them and saving me some time.The purpose of a suspense film is to be suspenseful.  That's why most suspense films don't lend themselves to repeat viewings unless they're exceptionally well made.  However, if a suspense film fails to deliver a surprise when you watch it the first time, then it can only be described as a collosal failure.On an unrelated and admittedly minor note: why does the film behave as if Austin and Hunstville are close to each other???  Texas is a big state, folks.  You can't just mosey on over to another Texas town or city like you're in Connecticut or something.  I know this is not very important, but it is really annoying if you know anything about Texas geography.The reason I gave the film 2 stars rather than one are as follows:1. I am an alumnus of the University of Texas, so all of the shots of UT and the city of Austin warmed the cockles of my heart.  That, however, is a rather esoteric reason to see a film.2. The performances of Kate Winslett and Kevin Spacey were both solid.  Although Kate may have done a film or two previously that was set in a contemporary time, I had not seen them.  Her accent was excellent, her portrayal convincing, and, straight up, she looked awesome.  Kevin does a professional job, as it to be expected.  Tangentially, Rhona Mitra, who plays the grad student Berlin, is going to be a star.  You heard it here first.In sum, I'd skip this one.  If you do decide to check it out, I'd like to pass on a caveat to parents who choose to take their children to R-rated films, as did mine.  There are a couple of scenes of violence and sexuality that are rather more graphic than you might expect.  Do take this into consideration when making the decision to take any child under the age of 15.",2,What a lame movie,1046908800,"03 6, 2003",2003,2373,"['movie', 'looked', 'bad', 'theatrical', 'previews', 'saw', 'anyway', 'friend', 'mine', 'wanted', 'check', 'out', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'not', 'pleasantly', 'surprised.The', 'main', 'problem', 'Life', 'David', 'Gale', 'surprise', 'ending', 'was', 'painfully', 'obvious', '45', 'minutes', 'so', 'much', 'whispered', 'friend', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'anyway', 'was', 'tempted', 'leave', 'could', 'tell', 'later', 'was', 'right', 'eneded', 'up', 'staying', 'much', 'chagrin', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'right', 'tried', 'split', 'surprise', 'ending', 'two', 'separate', 'twists', 'rather', 'consolidating', 'saving', 'time.The', 'purpose', 'suspense', 'film', 'be', 'suspenseful', 'why', 'most', 'suspense', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'lend', 'repeat', 'viewings', ""'re"", 'exceptionally', 'well', 'made', 'However', 'suspense', 'film', 'deliver', 'surprise', 'when', 'watch', 'first', 'time', 'then', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'collosal', 'unrelated', 'admittedly', 'minor', 'note', 'why', 'film', 'behave', 'Austin', 'Hunstville', 'are', 'close', 'other', 'Texas', 'big', 'state', 'folks', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'mosey', 'Texas', 'town', 'city', ""'re"", 'Connecticut', 'something', 'know', 'not', 'very', 'important', 'really', 'annoying', 'know', 'anything', 'Texas', 'geography.The', 'reason', 'gave', 'film', '2', 'stars', 'rather', 'one', 'are', 'follows:1', 'am', 'alumnus', 'University', 'Texas', 'shots', 'UT', 'city', 'Austin', 'warmed', 'cockles', 'heart', 'however', 'rather', 'esoteric', 'reason', 'see', 'film.2', 'performances', 'Kate', 'Winslett', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'were', 'solid', 'Kate', 'may', 'have', 'done', 'film', 'two', 'previously', 'was', 'set', 'contemporary', 'time', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'accent', 'was', 'excellent', 'portrayal', 'convincing', 'straight', 'up', 'looked', 'awesome', 'Kevin', 'professional', 'job', 'be', 'expected', 'Tangentially', 'Rhona', 'Mitra', 'who', 'grad', 'student', 'Berlin', 'going', 'be', 'star', 'heard', 'here', 'sum', ""'d"", 'skip', 'one', 'do', 'decide', 'check', 'out', ""'d"", 'like', 'pass', 'caveat', 'parents', 'who', 'choose', 'take', 'children', 'R-rated', 'films', 'did', 'mine', 'are', 'couple', 'scenes', 'violence', 'sexuality', 'are', 'rather', 'more', 'graphic', 'might', 'expect', 'Do', 'take', 'consideration', 'when', 'making', 'decision', 'take', 'child', 'age', '15']",N/A

The &quot;extras&quot; are worth watching.That said, I generally agree with most of the other comments posted here.  The story-line doesn't work.  There is a plot &quot;device&quot; right in the beginning:  Winslet's rental car breaks down.  This &quot;device&quot; is then used at the end when her rental car breaks down just when David Gale is being strapped down and the needle installed.  Winslet has to run about two miles and arrives too late to save Gale.  Hokey, but it works, sort-of.  But a plot device all the same, and audiences are far too smart not to recognize them.I do agree with one reviewer that the final scene just doesn't justify everything that has gone before.  When we see Gale step before the camera and look down at the dead woman, and then look into the camera with a dull expression, we are asked to believe that this brilliant college professor is really nothing more than a drunk and a dullard.  All of his dialog in the prison telling his tale shows us a man of extraordinary mental accumen.The central performances are ok, but I always enjoy the acting of the supporting players, such as the prison warden who shows Kate Winslet into the prison.  He gave a touch of reality that the main players often had trouble recreating.I'm not sure I get the point of this story.

609984,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JLZN,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","This film disappoints me.  You take Kate Winslet (MY FAVORITE WORKING ACTRESS, PERIOD), the phenomenal Kevin Spacey, the brilliant Laura Linney and the sultry Rhona Mitra, team them up with 2-Time Oscar nominated director Alan Parker and hand them the controversial subject of the death penalty and yet, when all is said and done, there is just something so off here.How does something like this happen?I admit, when I first saw this movie I really liked it, and I think that a lot of it had to do with the preconceived notions I wouldn't allow myself to see past.  I wanted this to be all sorts of brilliant, and when it fell short I convinced myself that I wasn't seeing what I was in fact seeing.I have to face the truth.The film follows a reporter, Bitsey Bloom (the name is the first of many missteps), as she attempts to prove the innocence of former teacher David Gale who is accused of brutally murdering his friend Constance Harraway.  He maintains his innocence despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.  His story sends Bitsey on a journey into the darkness that surrounded Constance's death.A journey that is rather pointless.The film cuts back and forth between the present and past to develop the character's and establish David's innocence and keep the viewer on constant edge as they race against the clock with Bitsey to uncover the truth.  There are the obvious creeps (Matt Craven is a ridiculously overworked clich&eacute; here) who have to be involved somehow, but the most ambiguous character is David himself, who just seems to be a lost soul.  My issue here is that, when all is said and done and the twist upon a twist is finally revealed, it becomes apparent that the journey David sends Bitsey on is POINTLESS.It was all something that could have been revealed in a much easier way.The acting is a little all over the place, which is said when you consider the cast.  To be honest, despite the absurdity of the film itself, Spacey is actually very, very good.  He really captures the destitution of this man, which is given multiple layers when the end is revealed and you see that his depressive nature is not really a result of his `impending death' but more or less because of his conscience weighing heavy on his shoulders.  The script didn't deserve his dedication to the role.  Laura Linney is effective, but her character comes off less human and more clich&eacute;.  Like I said, Winslet = the greatest actress working today, BUT, her performance here is weak.  She just doesn't do anything.  I disagree with some friends who say she is Razzie worthy here (that is just plain dumb), but she doesn't deserve any accolades for this one.  It's is a barely there, somewhat uneven (thanks to the thankless script) and desperate performance.In the end it is the horribly constructed script that does this film in.  It has an important message (the controversy surrounding the death penalty being legal murder is a strong one) but it is a message that has been perfectly developed in much better films (`Dead Man Walking' is one of the best films EVER MADE).  This is a pointless, messy and aggravating film that had all the elements to be perfection but wound up being a BIG mistake.",2,Flip the switch on this one...,1260316800,"12 9, 2009",2009,3217,"['film', 'take', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'MY', 'FAVORITE', 'WORKING', 'ACTRESS', 'PERIOD', 'phenomenal', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'brilliant', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'sultry', 'Rhona', 'Mitra', 'team', 'up', '2-Time', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'director', 'Alan', 'Parker', 'hand', 'controversial', 'subject', 'death', 'penalty', 'yet', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'just', 'something', 'so', 'here.How', 'something', 'happen', 'admit', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'really', 'liked', 'think', 'lot', 'had', 'do', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'would', ""n't"", 'allow', 'see', 'past', 'wanted', 'be', 'sorts', 'brilliant', 'when', 'fell', 'short', 'convinced', 'was', ""n't"", 'seeing', 'what', 'was', 'fact', 'seeing.I', 'have', 'face', 'truth.The', 'film', 'reporter', 'Bitsey', 'Bloom', 'name', 'first', 'many', 'missteps', 'prove', 'innocence', 'former', 'teacher', 'David', 'Gale', 'who', 'accused', 'brutally', 'murdering', 'friend', 'Constance', 'Harraway', 'innocence', 'overwhelming', 'evidence', 'contrary', 'story', 'Bitsey', 'journey', 'darkness', 'surrounded', 'Constance', 'death.A', 'journey', 'rather', 'pointless.The', 'film', 'cuts', 'back', 'forth', 'present', 'past', 'develop', 'character', 'establish', 'David', 'innocence', 'keep', 'viewer', 'constant', 'edge', 'race', 'clock', 'Bitsey', 'uncover', 'truth', 'are', 'obvious', 'creeps', 'Matt', 'Craven', 'ridiculously', 'overworked', 'clich', 'eacute', 'here', 'who', 'have', 'be', 'involved', 'somehow', 'most', 'ambiguous', 'character', 'David', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'lost', 'soul', 'issue', 'here', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'twist', 'twist', 'finally', 'revealed', 'apparent', 'journey', 'David', 'Bitsey', 'POINTLESS.It', 'was', 'something', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'revealed', 'much', 'easier', 'way.The', 'acting', 'little', 'place', 'said', 'when', 'consider', 'cast', 'be', 'honest', 'absurdity', 'film', 'Spacey', 'actually', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'really', 'destitution', 'man', 'given', 'multiple', 'layers', 'when', 'end', 'revealed', 'see', 'depressive', 'nature', 'not', 'really', 'result', 'impending', 'death', 'more', 'less', 'conscience', 'weighing', 'heavy', 'shoulders', 'script', 'did', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'dedication', 'role', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'effective', 'character', 'off', 'less', 'human', 'more', 'clich', 'eacute', 'said', 'Winslet', '=', 'greatest', 'actress', 'working', 'today', 'BUT', 'performance', 'here', 'weak', 'just', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'disagree', 'friends', 'who', 'say', 'Razzie', 'worthy', 'here', 'just', 'plain', 'dumb', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'accolades', 'one', 'barely', 'somewhat', 'uneven', 'thanks', 'thankless', 'script', 'desperate', 'performance.In', 'end', 'horribly', 'constructed', 'script', 'film', 'important', 'message', 'controversy', 'surrounding', 'death', 'penalty', 'being', 'legal', 'murder', 'strong', 'one', 'message', 'been', 'perfectly', 'developed', 'much', 'better', 'films', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Walking', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'EVER', 'MADE', 'pointless', 'messy', 'aggravating', 'film', 'had', 'elements', 'be', 'perfection', 'wound', 'up', 'being', 'BIG', 'mistake']",N/A

609986,A3S87ZOPB3UM9N,B00005JLZN,atmj,"[2, 3]","Phenomenal acting by Kate Winslet and Kevin Spacey.  Great timing and incredible storyBASE STORY:Kate Winslet is a well-known reporter, Bitsy Bloom (where do they come up with these names?).  She is asked by a man on death row that has 4 days left to live, to interview him.  This man Kevin Spacey (David Gale) has not even given an interview prior to this.  Now, it is almost too late.  Her magazine fearful of her recently received reputation for her sympathetic ear toward people convicted of terrible crimes is hesistent to send her.  Concerned also of her safety they saddle her with an intern.  His presence though resented by her, provides a conduit/foil for some of her ideas.THE CONVICTED MAN:David Gale (Kevin Spacey)prior to his conviction, was a professor and activist.  He was a well known opponent to the death penalty and fairly high up in a group known as Deathwatch.  These activists regularly picketed prisons where the executions take place. It is with irony that he finds himself so convicted.  His crime is that of cruelly killing a fellow professor who was also active in Deathwatch.OUTLINE OF THE STORY:During the interview, Bitsy feels that David Gale is wrongly convicted.  He states his innocence and offers no ideas for who committed the crime, but relates the event leading up the crime.As she has only 3 days of 2 hours of contact with him, she spends her off time, trying to prove his innocence.  It seems as tense and as hectic as you can imagine it would.  No stay of execution seems likely.IN SUMMARY:I cannot tell you more, in fear, I will unravel the unique ending to this story.  However, this was an excellent movie, right up to the last moment you are holding on to your chair and the ending is very well done.For those of you that want to know, there is some brief nudity that is somewhat disturbing (pictures of the body).

Kevin Spacey is interesting playing a drunk, but he doesn't play effectively seductive, particularly villainous or necessarily vague ever. He's shown more depth and more believability in other roles. The always-bankable Laura Linney was decent in it, but, on the whole, the film absolutely blew. Kate Winslet was completely annoying, doing wildly implausible and ridiculous things.I'd figured out their big, special twist five minutes into the first flashback. Since the film is so clearly anti-death penalty, it doesn't even bother to notice that the State of Texas and the Death Penalty itself are not villains at the end because of the odd twist.Before the key flashbacks, as well, there were quick cuts to words on paper, in chalkboards.

So why a 3 star rating?

609998,A3OEECMCM2T4KQ,B00005JLZN,C. Middleton,"[5, 5]","This is a powerful film with a flawless performance from Kevin Spacey. It is ultimately a moral tale, pushing a particular position concerning the death penalty debate. The way it goes about it, however, ensures the audience will walk away from the experience with at least a tiny glimmer of doubt in their minds, as to whether it is proper for a government to execute its citizens. As our judicial system is less than perfect, the system always runs the risk of killing an innocent person, based on flimsy testimony, fuelled by a hell bent desire for revenge. That's part of the problem. Revenge seems to be hard wired in our brains. It is a powerful emotion, so powerful in fact, that it can blind us from the truth. This film illustrates this fact in a very profound way.David Gale is a successful philosophy professor who is an anti death penalty advocate. He is happily married to a beautiful woman with a lovely little boy. Life appears to be good, until he drinks too much at a party and has a five-minute affair with one of his attractive students in the up stairs bathroom. He relents to his base desires and pays the price. This particular student wants revenge because she wants to pass his course without doing the work. The next morning, Gale feels bad, but feels worse later when he's arrested for rape. The student wants revenge and is wholly successful because Gale's life spins out of control. His beautiful wife leaves him and he loses his job, never to return to academia. Even though the charges end up being dropped, he's a marked man. His drinking gets worse and the only job he can get is a management position at an electronics store. Gale's life gets worse, though, when he's old colleague, is found raped and murdered and he's accused of the crime. Ironically, he ends up on death row. Days away from being executed, he requests a news reporter to tell his story. Gale, of course, claims he's innocent, and as the story unfolds, something far more insidious bubbles to the surface, and it becomes a race against the eleventh hour. Is Gale innocent, has he been set up, or did he do it?This is a well-written and professionally executed film with a powerful message. There's no smugness, taking a moral high ground, and beating us over the head with it. It has all the successful ingredients of a top class thriller, building tension all the way to its climactic and surprising end.The Life of David Gale is a class act film and well worth the experience.",4,Well-crafted thriller with a compelling message,1099094400,"10 30, 2004",2004,2480,"['powerful', 'film', 'flawless', 'performance', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'ultimately', 'moral', 'tale', 'pushing', 'particular', 'position', 'concerning', 'death', 'penalty', 'debate', 'way', 'however', 'audience', 'will', 'walk', 'away', 'experience', 'least', 'tiny', 'glimmer', 'doubt', 'minds', 'proper', 'government', 'execute', 'citizens', 'judicial', 'system', 'less', 'perfect', 'system', 'always', 'risk', 'killing', 'innocent', 'person', 'based', 'flimsy', 'testimony', 'fuelled', 'hell', 'bent', 'desire', 'revenge', 'part', 'problem', 'Revenge', 'be', 'hard', 'wired', 'brains', 'powerful', 'emotion', 'so', 'powerful', 'fact', 'can', 'blind', 'truth', 'film', 'fact', 'very', 'profound', 'way.David', 'Gale', 'successful', 'philosophy', 'professor', 'who', 'anti', 'death', 'penalty', 'advocate', 'happily', 'married', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'lovely', 'little', 'boy', 'Life', 'be', 'good', 'too', 'much', 'party', 'five-minute', 'affair', 'one', 'attractive', 'students', 'up', 'stairs', 'bathroom', 'base', 'desires', 'price', 'particular', 'student', 'revenge', 'pass', 'course', 'doing', 'work', 'next', 'morning', 'Gale', 'bad', 'feels', 'worse', 'later', 'when', 'arrested', 'rape', 'student', 'revenge', 'wholly', 'successful', 'Gale', 'life', 'control', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'job', 'never', 'return', 'academia', 'Even', 'charges', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'dropped', 'marked', 'man', 'drinking', 'worse', 'only', 'job', 'can', 'get', 'management', 'position', 'electronics', 'store', 'Gale', 'life', 'worse', 'when', 'old', 'colleague', 'found', 'raped', 'murdered', 'accused', 'crime', 'Ironically', 'up', 'death', 'row', 'away', 'being', 'executed', 'news', 'reporter', 'tell', 'story', 'Gale', 'course', 'innocent', 'story', 'unfolds', 'something', 'far', 'more', 'insidious', 'bubbles', 'surface', 'race', 'eleventh', 'hour', 'Gale', 'innocent', 'been', 'set', 'up', 'did', 'do', 'well-written', 'professionally', 'executed', 'film', 'powerful', 'message', 'smugness', 'taking', 'moral', 'high', 'ground', 'beating', 'head', 'successful', 'ingredients', 'top', 'class', 'thriller', 'building', 'tension', 'way', 'climactic', 'surprising', 'end.The', 'Life', 'David', 'Gale', 'class', 'act', 'film', 'well', 'experience']",N/A

With the talent Alan Parker had here this should have been a great film, but the plot was dense and the characters one and all with the exception of Kate Winslet's naively duped reporter, Bitsy, were so disturbed and disturbing that I didn't like them. This is a bleak motion picture that seems padded out to the point of it being obvious this was a one message story. I honestly think the writers had just a single firm notion here, that being how they wished to end The Life of David Gale with its admittedly powerful twist, and the remainder of the run-time was hasty-concocted filler.",3,Relatively Disappointing Considering The People Involved,1157932800,"09 11, 2006",2006,1209,"['Life', 'David', 'Gale', 'attempted', 'morality', 'play', 'subject', 'death', 'penalty', 'America', 'today', 'title', 'character', 'former', 'Texas', 'college', 'professor', 'anti-death', 'penalty', 'activist', 'David', 'Gale', 'convicted', 'murdering', 'friend', 'played', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'down', 'final', 'days', 'existence', 'earth', 'downwardly-spiraling', 'life', 'story', 'arrogant', 'leftist', 'intellectual', 'condemned', 'inmate', 'told', 'flashback', 'form', 'exploration', 'case', 'idealistic', 'young', 'reporter', 'Bitsy', 'Bloom', 'who', 'Gale', 'innocence', 'desperately', 'prove', 'too', 'late', 'talent', 'Alan', 'Parker', 'had', 'here', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'film', 'plot', 'was', 'dense', 'characters', 'one', 'exception', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'naively', 'duped', 'reporter', 'Bitsy', 'were', 'so', 'disturbed', 'disturbing', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'bleak', 'motion', 'picture', 'padded', 'out', 'point', 'being', 'obvious', 'was', 'one', 'message', 'story', 'honestly', 'think', 'writers', 'had', 'just', 'single', 'firm', 'notion', 'here', 'being', 'how', 'wished', 'end', 'Life', 'David', 'Gale', 'admittedly', 'powerful', 'twist', 'remainder', 'run-time', 'was', 'hasty-concocted', 'filler']",N/A

Whatever it is, The Life of David Gale probably won't change it; It is, however, enjoyable for what it is, which is basically a whodunit.Kevin Spacey plays David Gale, a death-row convict with 4 days to go until his execution. He agrees to spend two hours a day speaking with Reporter Bitsy Bloom (Kate Winslet), and as he tells her his story, we learn the reason he's about to be executed. Gale, formerly a high-profile opponent of the death-penalty, has been convicted of the rape and murder of his Death Watch partner Constance (Laura Linney). Bitsy believes Gale is innocent, and sets out to find the evidence that will overturn his conviction.The film is told mainly in flashback, and the many twists and turns the plot takes will have you rehashing those scenes in your mind for days trying to uncover clues, much like another Spacey film, The Usual Suspects. I can see the ""Twist Ending"" of a film coming a mile off, and after I solved the mystery here, the filmmakers threw in one more twist that I didn't see coming at all. The ending revelation is pretty far-fetched, but it's a neat twist nonetheless. The film goes a little overboard with it's anti-death-penalty politics at times, but never to the point of annoyance.

610002,A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY,B00005JLZN,"David A. Dein ""passafist""","[9, 16]","I don't understand pure liberal thinking and I probably never will. I also don't understand why and how academics get away with sounding so silly sometimes. But most importantly I don't understand why a film like THE LIFE OF DAVID GALE could get made. A film so patronizing it was designed to do one thing. What is that do you ask: to act as a sounding board for the liberal agenda? Or maybe just to discredit them? Hmm...maybe it was made to make right wingers look like evil jackasses? Whatever the answer, whomever the audience it fails on every level.Capital punishment is huge hot button topic. It's one that will be debated for a long time. DAVID GALE is specifically designed to play to those who agree with the mantra that capital punishment is wrong. I disagree with this notion so the film didn't at all play to me at all.THE LIFE OF DAVID GALE follows an intrepid reporter named Bitsey Bloom (Kate Winslet, Holy Smoke) whom has been given the opportunity to interview death row inmate David Gale (Kevin Spacey, The Shipping News). Gale is a local college philosophy professor who was convicted of murdering his colleague, Constance Harraway (Lauren Linny, Maze). They both worked for an anti-death penalty group called Deathwatch.By all accounts Gale is innocent of all charges, but why is he on death row? As the story unfolds you begin to understand why and if by the end of the film you still have faith in the other side, you better watch out. DAVID GALE made me want to become a death row guard just so jackasses like him don't exist. But that's the end of the movie, I'll get to that later.DAVID GALE is missing one crucial element, humanity. The story while shot nicely, with vibrant colors and beautiful framing is preachy to say the least and at worst patronizing. From the very first moment the film has an agenda which is more important than the character's in the film. For the most part David Gale doesn't talk like a human being but like a political manifesto. Instead of having meaningful conversation, he more or less speaks in intellectual quips.Kevin Spacey is a good actor, but when he's not directed well enough his hidden intensity can become dulled. This performance very much mirrors his performance in `PAY IT FORWARD' while adequate it walks that thin line between great and dull and for the most part it comes out being the latter.Bitsey Bloom is the exact opposite of this, for her realization comes not because she wants it to happen, but because the screenplay calls her to be hard edged until near the end when she fights to get at the truth. It's a shame because Winslet gives a great performance. (As a side note I almost wished they had let her use her own accent, because in this film it seemed like her American accents was holding her back.)Director Alan Parker (Pink Floyd: The Wall) is one of my favorites, cause even if his films fail at least there compelling. But this film is so flat and so fake, I will chalk it up to a bad decision he made.It's at this moment that I would like to thank first time screenwriter Charles Randolph (The Interpreter) for finally offering to me the definition of the word &quot;schmuck&quot;. That was one of those words everybody assumed I knew what it meant and now I know and boy it's not as bad as I thought it was. As for his screenplay on a whole, it sucks. It's a first draft at best, why Universal decided to put it's money behind this clunker of a script is beyond me.It has so many flaws; the worst offenders are scenes that just don't belong. A red Herring moment with a shower just included for jumps, a scene in which Gale has a conversation with his son that is so unbelievably bad it should have been rewritten. Another big problem I had with this movie is if you work for a big name news magazine why would the send a top notch reporter out with an intern, wouldn't they send a publicist or someone who know their way around a story? Hmm... I don't know. It kind of bugged me,But the worst scene is the very last. I won't ruin it for you but I will say this: Do the ends ever justify the means? For David Gale they absolutely do not.Plus to movie for some reason thinks it's necessary to be funny at moments when it shouldn't. Yes there are jokes in this film, not one of which works. If the film had been a satire, this film just may have worked. But alas, THE LIFE OF DAVID GALE is a drama, and a poor one at that.The makers of THE LIFE OF DAVID GALE should all sit down and watch Alfred Hitchcock's ROPE, I felt like Jimmy Stewart's character as the end of the movie began to unfold. Is David Gale a hero? In my book no, he's like a pro-life protester that kills an abortion doctor, he hasn't helped his cause, and he's destroyed it. This film is a waste of some powerful potential.THE LIFE OF DAVID GALE is one that's not worth living.",1,"Die David Gale, Die",1064448000,"09 25, 2003",2003,4838,"['do', ""n't"", 'understand',

Although Kevin Spacey pulls off a believable performance in a starring role, this feature contains a lot of loose ends left for the viewer to tie together - therefore, with the plotline containing several huge, gaping holes. In short, the storyline will leave the viewer thinking ""What the hell?"" in certain points of the movie. The various adjectives (sprayed in graffiti form), such as ""ANGER"", ""FEAR"", ""ECSTASY"" (whatever), etc., that appear between the plot sequences and the interview scences do not help piece everything together very clearly, either. This, as well as ""...David Gale""'s"" dragginess quality will not win many popularity contests with the average viewer, neither. So, even though this picture's negative points far outweigh what little it has going for it, the positives contained within are the horrific and disturbing scenes, which, unfortunately, are the only ones that are most likely to grab whatever brief and undivided attention this film will afford to give you. The only other bright spot which gleams the brightest here, are the Oscar-caliber performances of its two stars, Kevin Spacey and Kate Winslet, whose performance (of the latter) here hasn't been this stunning since the 1998 monster flick ""Titanic"".

Since doing so will spoil the whole film for you I will try to avoid them as much as possible.David Gale &#65533; lifelong fighter against death penalty, is convicted of rape and murder of Constance Hallaway and is sentenced to be executed. 4 days before his execution he agrees to give a 3-day interview to Bitsey Bloom. Although convinced of his guilt at first, during the interview she starts to doubt it and sets out to prove his innocence. The story throughout the film is told through Bitseys eyes, as she listens to David Gale.The movie is about capital punishment, as I&#65533;m sure everyone knows it.

To begin with, even though he is obviously being cuckolded by his wife, David Gale does nothing to rid himself of her and keep his beloved son.  Instead he does something so terribly stupid that he loses everything: his son, his reputation, and his job.  Even a moron would have been suspicious when she asks him to bite her shoulder, let alone to tear off her pants and to be rough!Secondly, is there any real reason why two such attractive actresses as Kate Winslet and Laura Linney have to look and dress so unattractively?  Is it because they believe they won't be taken seriously if they're pretty?  What harm would a few minutes with a curling iron do to their causes?  Linney's character says, ""I've tried so hard not to be a sex object.""  Good God, why?Third, it is obvious practically from the beginning that one character is not who he/she appears to be.  Thus it is not much of a surprise when it is revealed at the end.Fourth, if Winslett is indeed a serious writer, why does she call herself ""Bitsey?""  And why would a smart woman not return the obviously defective rental vehicle for another one?  Can't she anticipate her dash through the rain in a ""climactic"" scene?Fifth, I hated the thinly veiled portrayal of then-governor George W. Bush.  Why didn't they just make him leer and twirl his mustache like Snidely Whiplash?  His point of view was a valid one, but the deck was stacked against him.Sixth, when the rape charges against David Gale were dropped, why was the deck so stacked against him?  Why the disgusting motel with the ""mud pool?""  Where were his friends and supporters?  For all his intelligence, how did he allow himself to fall so far?Seventh, why did Berlin set up the ""rape?""As for the denouement itself, I did understand the noble motives of all concerned.  However, the nudity, I felt, was gratuitous and was repeated more than was necessary.On the plus side, I feel that Spacey, Winslett, Linney, and especially Gabriel Mann as the young intern Zack did a good job.

Bitzy (Kate Winslet) is to interview former college professer and well known death row abolitionist David Gale (Kevin Spacey). Ironically enough he is on death row for the rape and murder of one of his colleges/friends played by Laura Linney.Now, Bisty has three days to figure out if Davids story of being framed is true, and who the real culprit is.SOUNDS ORIGINAL AND INTRUIGING EH? NOT REALLY.This was a big suprise especially from director Alan Parker who has brought us classics like Angel Heart and Midnight Express.Where the movie failed is where 2/3 of thrillers these days do, comming up with an original plotline without the overuse of cliches and wannabe twists. This movie is full of both.While Kevin Spacey underplays the role and delivers a rock solid performance, Titanic chick Kate Winselt overacts to the point of no return. This makes the film even more unbeliveable.Laura Linney delivers a belivable and moving performance as the over-zelick death row abolitionist who will stop at nothing to prove a cause. Unfortunatly neither Spacey or Linney's performances can save a screenplay that uses the ""out of service"" cell phone cliche and is expected to be taken seriously.I understand what The Life of David Gale was trying to deliver in terms of its message on death row and capital punishment, but it did not need to be delivered to us in a package marked cliche.",2,Mindless and cliche thriller that could have been much more,1056412800,"06 24, 2003",2003,1551,"['Life', 'David', 'Gale', 'hot-to-trot', 'reporter', 'Bitzy', 'Bloom', 'why', 'screenwritter', 'chose', 'name', 'other', 'name', 'world', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'Bitzy', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'interview', 'former', 'college', 'professer', 'well', 'known', 'death', 'row', 'abolitionist', 'David', 'Gale', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Ironically', 'enough', 'death', 'row', 'rape', 'murder', 'one', 'colleges/friends', 'played', 'Laura', 'Linney.Now', 'Bisty', 'three', 'days', 'figure', 'out', 'Davids', 'story', 'being', 'framed', 'true', 'who', 'real', 'culprit', 'is.SOUNDS', 'ORIGINAL', 'AND', 'INTRUIGING', 'EH', 'NOT', 'REALLY.This', 'was', 'big', 'suprise', 'especially', 'director', 'Alan', 'Parker', 'who', 'brought', 'classics', 'Angel', 'Heart', 'Midnight', 'Express.Where', 'movie', 'failed', 'where', '2/3', 'thrillers', 'days', 'do', 'comming', 'up', 'original', 'plotline', 'overuse', 'cliches', 'wannabe', 'twists', 'movie', 'full', 'both.While', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'role', 'rock', 'solid', 'performance', 'Titanic', 'chick', 'Kate', 'Winselt', 'point', 'return', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'unbeliveable.Laura', 'Linney', 'belivable', 'moving', 'performance', 'over-zelick', 'death', 'row', 'abolitionist', 'who', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'prove', 'cause', 'Unfortunatly', 'Spacey', 'Linney', 'performances', 'can', 'save', 'screenplay', 'service', 'cell', 'phone', 'cliche', 'expected', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously.I', 'understand', 'what', 'Life', 'David', 'Gale', 'was', 'trying', 'deliver', 'terms', 'message', 'death', 'row', 'capital', 'punishment', 'did', 'not', 'need', 'be', 'delivered', 'package', 'marked', 'cliche']",N/A
610009,AA4PDCITO3O48,B00005JLZN,"Diluted Acid ""Marc""","[2, 3]","I thought this movie's topic was quite interesting, however at times i thought the acting was a bit stupid though the acting was overall good, though hasn't Kevin Spacey played the same role too many times.David Gale(Kevin Spacey) plays as a death row convict with only 4 days to go until he is executed. David Gale agrees to spend 2 hours a day talking with reporter Bitsy Bloom(Kate Winslet) who is there to find out if he really did rape and murder his Death Watch partner Constance(Laura Linney). Bitsy is very sure David is innocent and she sets off seeking for proof that he did not rape while her cohortn intern reporter Zack(Gabriel Mann) pieces together the clues.I thought the movie was great, the acting was overall well done. Kevin Spacey acted well as a man a ready to be executed and during the flashbacks of before he was convivted he acts well as a sad, depressed man who had just lost his wife, son and job as a philosophy teacher. The only time i thought his acting was silly was the scene were he is stumbling on streets talking to people about philosphy and trying to act drunk which he couldn't do, otherwise his acting was good.I thought Kate Winslets acting as a reporter was silly seeming,she tried to have a good american accent, however failed and she always kept the same facial expression, apart from that her acting was fine or maybe a bit below fine.The topic of the story was interesting, it was on capital punishment a very interesting topic for a film and i really like the twist at the end which raised my rating of 3 stars to 4 stars. The main thing that bothered me about this film is that it was a bit depressing, like i mean it would be pretty depressing to live a life like Kevin Spacey in the film and i found the scene were Kate Winslet and Gabriel Mann watch the tape pretty depressing, and i though it was a bit pointless how before the key flashbacks there would be quick cuts to words on paper in chalk boards(RAPE, REPUTATION, ACCUSATION, MURDER) and then the camera would spin.

610010,A2XSGVBHS37L2B,B00005JLZN,"D. Mills ""WatchThis""","[4, 5]","This film reminds me of those mega-platters served at my favorite Mexican restaurant: gargantuan, and cluttered with little embellishments that distract from the main course, but somehow quite satisfying when I'm in the mood. I had barely heard of this film until now, and it took a critical drubbing when it was released in early 2003, probably limiting its exposure.What we have here is a plot connecting recently-divorced college professor David Gale, (Kevin Spacey), four days before his execution for the death, seven years prior, of Constance, a co-worker at Deathwatch, an organization dedicated to abolishing the death penalty. She is found handcuffed, naked on her kitchen floor, asphyxiated in Romanian 'Securitate' fashion by a plastic bag over her head. She's got Gale's DNA inside her, and he becomes the prime suspect, especially in light of an earlier 'situation' he was set up for. Something's not quite right, and we're called in, along with journalist Bitsey Bloom (Kate Winslet) to figure it out what's going on, ostensibly so that Gale's young son will grow up with the correct impression of what his dad is all about. Now wrap this in a Texas setting, and add plenty of political hot sauce over capital punishment, and you've got a vast jumble of elements that need juggling. In my opinion, it succeeds reasonably well. We see things unfold through Winslet's eyes in a manner reminiscent of Mia Farrow in 'Rosemary's Baby', and the effect is enchanting.Director Alan Parker is not the most subtle cinematographer, and this work is no exception: we're bombarded by a vast array of incidental details, lights flashing, drunken excess, and bad limericks. It's easy to see why he was attracted to the detailed, somewhat obsessive script. The saving grace is that the script and director make the details work for the narrative. Characterizations are handled deftly so that going over the plot line from beginning to end - assuming you can accept a couple of basic premises whose revelation would amount to spoilers here- you can reflect on every character's motivation. Therein lies the film's greatest strength, even as it swims in its political gumbo.Kevin Spacey gives us one of those smug, holier-than-thou Kaiser Soze-like interpretations here. He annoys me this way, but I'm not going to single out Alan Parker because the esteemed Professor Spacey dishes something he's apparently genetically programmed for - and face it, this script calls for that. For some reason, the entire cast dished out mega-helpings of overacting during the first half hour. As their collective adrenaline waned, things came closer back to earth and settled into something of an inspired groove.If you're at all intrigued by this, you'll find this DVD excellent value, probably worth a purchase. There is a decent handful of extras: a good 'making of', some interviews, and commentary by Parker. Overall, I think Parker's high point is the 1986 film 'Angel Heart', where the element of fantasy was better suited to his visual montages, but this offering has plenty of personality, even if you have accept the whole 'David Gale' situation like a bunch of in-laws that you love in spite of a few vexing traits.",4,A sprawling cinematic meal,1112400000,"04 2, 2005",2005,3208,"['film', 'mega-platters', 'served', 'favorite', 'Mexican', 'restaurant', 'gargantuan', 'cluttered', 'little', 'embellishments', 'distract', 'main', 'course', 'somehow', 'quite', 'satisfying', 'when', ""'m"", 'mood', 'had', 'barely', 'heard', 'film', 'now', 'took', 'critical', 'drubbing', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'early', '2003', 'probably', 'limiting', 'exposure.What', 'have', 'here', 'plot', 'connecting', 'recently-divorced', 'college', 'professor', 'David', 'Gale', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'four', 'days', 'execution', 'death', 'seven', 'years', 'prior', 'Constance', 'co-worker', 'Deathwatch', 'organization', 'dedicated', 'abolishing', 'death', 'penalty', 'found', 'handcuffed', 'naked', 'kitchen', 'floor', 'asphyxiated', 'Romanian', ""'Securitate"", 'fashion', 'plastic', 'bag', 'head', 'got', 'Gale', 'DNA', 'prime', 'suspect', 'especially', 'light', 'earlier', ""'situation"", 'was', 'set', 'up', 'Something', 'not', 'quite', 'right', ""'re"", 'called', 'journalist', 'Bitsey', 'Bloom', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'ostensibly', 'Gale', 'young', 'son', 'will', 'grow', 'up', 'correct', 'impression', 'what', 'dad', 'Now', 'Texas', 'setting', 'add', 'plenty', 'political', 'hot', 'sauce', 'capital', 'punishment', ""'ve"", 'got', 'vast', 'jumble', 'elements', 'need', 'juggling', 'opinion', 'reasonably', 'well', 'see', 'things', 'unfold', 'Winslet', 'eyes', 'manner', 'reminiscent', 'Mia', 'Farrow', ""'Rosemary"", 'Baby', 'effect', 'enchanting.Director', 'Alan', 'Parker', 'not', 'most', 'subtle', 'cinematographer', 'work', 'exception', ""'re"", 'bombarded', 'vast', 'array', 'incidental', 'details', 'lights', 'flashing', 'drunken', 'excess', 'bad', 'limericks', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'was', 'attracted', 'detailed', 'somewhat', 'obsessive', 'script', 'saving', 'grace', 'script', 'director', 'make', 'details', 'work', 'narrative', 'Characterizations', 'are', 'handled', 'deftly', 'going', 'plot', 'line', 'beginning', 'end', 'assuming', 'can', 'accept', 'couple', 'basic', 'premises', 'revelation', 'would', 'amount', 'spoilers', 'here-', 'can', 'reflect', 'character', 'motivation', 'Therein', 'film', 'greatest', 'strength', 'even', 'political', 'gumbo.Kevin', 'Spacey', 'one', 'smug', 'holier-than-thou', 'Kaiser', 'Soze-like', 'interpretations', 'here', 'way', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'single', 'out', 'Alan', 'Parker', 'esteemed', 'Professor', 'Spacey', 'something', 'apparently', 'genetically', 'programmed', 'face', 'script', 'reason', 'entire', 'cast', 'dished', 'mega-helpings', 'overacting', 'first', 'hour', 'collective', 'adrenaline', 'waned', 'things', 'came', 'closer', 'back', 'earth', 'settled', 'something', 'inspired', 'groove.If', ""'re"", 'intrigued', ""'ll"", 'find', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'value', 'probably', 'purchase', 'decent', 'handful', 'extras', 'good', ""'making"", 'interviews', 'commentary', 'Parker', 'Overall', 'think', 'Parker', 'high', 'point', '1986', 'film', ""'Angel"", 'Heart', 'where', 'element', 'fantasy', 'was', 'better', 'suited', 'visual', 'montages', 'offering', 'plenty', 'personality', 'even', 'have', 'accept', 'whole', 'Gale', 'situation', 'bunch', 'in-laws', 'love', 'spite', 'few', 'vexing', 'traits']",N/A

610014,A3POLEU6T17739,B00005JLZN,E. Callaway,"[4, 4]","This, plain and simple, was one of the most profound and striking films I have ever seen.  David Gale, played by Kevin Spacey, is a University professor who is the regional director of ""Deathwatch,"" an activist group who vehemently opposes the death penalty. Gale, considered a genius by the academic community, was tried and convicted of the rape and murder of his colleague and best friend, Constance. He was sentenced to die in the State of Texas penal system.  The irony being that he himself, one of biggest opponents of the death penalty, would have landed on death row.The story is told in a series of flashbacks, to a reporter, whom Gale has entrusted his freedom, his very life for that matter.  Bitsy, the reporter, played by Kate Winslet, herself has had a run-in with the law.  Gale tells the story of how he was fired from his job, how his life was ruined, and how he ended up being put on death row.  Throughout the story it becomes more and more evident that he was innocent of the murder of his best friend.There was a tripod at the scene of the murder.  Gale in turn, knows that there was a camera at the scene, and knows whoever put it there, holds the key to his freedom.The film transitions from scene to scene with a speed and precision that was absolutely stunning.  The story becomes more and more gripping.  There are not many things that can be said about this movie that would not ruin it. Know that it is genius, but also know that if you are strong in pro-death penalty beliefs, this may not well be the film for you.  It is screamingly liberal.

It was about David Gale (obviously), played to perfection by Kevin Spacey.  Gale is an alchohol guzzling, anti-capitol punishment crusader who is accused of rape and murder in Texas.  Sitting on death row, he gives his last interview to Bitsey Bloom, played by Kate Winslet, who also does an admirable job.  Done in flashbacks, Gale tells her the story of what led up to his conviction.  While she goes into this interview totally believing he's guilty, she soon has her doubts.  These are further supported by the ""cowboy"" who seems to be following her and her partner around.  She has 3 days to prove Gale's innocence or he'll be put to death.  Is he guilty or is he the victim of a setup by some hard core capitol punishment activist or politician who wants him out of the way?

610016,A3L2U581LL17EB,B00005JLZN,Eric,"[3, 4]","The Life of David Gale was slammed by critics for being a sanctimonious preachfest. I prefer to view the movie as a mystery/thriller with the death penalty views as a background for its plot. Seen as thus, this is a mostly satisfying thriller, packed with just the right amount of twists and turns, red herrings, and intriguing characters to entertain for its two-hour running time.Kate Winslet (look prettier than ever) star as Bitsey Bloom, a journalist who is on task to interview David Gale (Kevin Spacey) before he is to be executed in three days. He was a former professor sentenced for the rape and murder of Constance Harraway (Laura Linney), who along with Gale, were close friends and advocates against the death penalty. As Gale unfolds the tale of the last few months of his life before the murder, she slowly begins to believe he might actually be innocent and that the real killer could be very well out there, watching her every move.As I said before, The Life of David Gale is a very entertaining thriller. Seen as just that, a thriller, it does have its flaws, some of it pertaining to Winslet. Her performance is actually quite good, it's that, as is the case with a lot of movies in this genre, the &quot;detectives&quot; are usually the least well-developed characters, simply because they're there to gather the facts and piece the clues together. The only things we know about her is that she's determined and very tenacious.Both Spacey and Linney are excellent, convincing in their portrayals of normal individuals who suffer plenty of heartbreak in their lives, with the latter eventually losing hers in a brutal manner. Spacey, during the interview scenes, exudes an aura of mystery and quiet uneasiness, basically the same style of acting he's relied on almost his entire career. Still, he's good at it, but one wonders when he'll really break out into something completely different.The film runs smoothly for most of its running time, and the movie's first big twist, revealed with about a half-hour left, caught me off-guard, in a good way. It's the final scene that irks me. That last shot should have been omitted from the film, as it negates the purpose of much of what went on the previous two hours and might even make you lose complete respect for one of its major characters. Director Alan Parker obviously meant for this shot to chill us, and while it will probably to that effect initially, you're going to feel cheated once the credits have rolled.",4,An engaging thriller,1064275200,"09 23, 2003",2003,2487,"['Life', 'David', 'Gale', 'was', 'slammed', 'critics', 'being', 'sanctimonious', 'preachfest', 'prefer', 'view', 'movie', 'mystery/thriller', 'death', 'penalty', 'views', 'background', 'plot', 'Seen', 'thus', 'mostly', 'satisfying', 'thriller', 'packed', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'twists', 'turns', 'red', 'herrings', 'intriguing', 'characters', 'entertain', 'two-hour', 'running', 'time.Kate', 'Winslet', 'look', 'prettier', 'ever', 'star', 'Bitsey', 'Bloom', 'journalist', 'who', 'task', 'interview', 'David', 'Gale', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'be', 'executed', 'three', 'days', 'was', 'former', 'professor', 'sentenced', 'rape', 'murder', 'Constance', 'Harraway', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'who', 'Gale', 'were', 'close', 'friends', 'advocates', 'death', 'penalty', 'Gale', 'tale', 'last', 'few', 'months', 'life', 'murder', 'slowly', 'believe', 'might', 'actually', 'be', 'innocent', 'real', 'killer', 'could', 'be', 'very', 'well', 'there', 'watching', 'move.As', 'said', 'Life', 'David', 'Gale', 'very', 'entertaining', 'thriller', 'Seen', 'just', 'thriller', 'have', 'flaws', 'pertaining', 'Winslet', 'performance', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'that', 'case', 'lot', 'movies', 'genre', 'quot', 'quot', 'are', 'usually', 'least', 'well-developed', 'characters', 'simply', ""'re"", 'gather', 'facts', 'piece', 'clues', 'together', 'only', 'things', 'know', 'determined', 'very', 'tenacious.Both', 'Spacey', 'Linney', 'are', 'excellent', 'convincing', 'portrayals', 'normal', 'individuals', 'who', 'suffer', 'plenty', 'heartbreak', 'lives', 'latter', 'eventually', 'losing', 'hers', 'brutal', 'manner', 'Spacey', 'interview', 'scenes', 'aura', 'mystery', 'quiet', 'uneasiness', 'basically', 'same', 'style', 'acting', 'relied', 'almost', 'entire', 'career', 'Still', 'good', 'one', 'wonders', 'when', ""'ll"", 'really', 'break', 'out', 'something', 'completely', 'different.The', 'film', 'smoothly', 'most', 'running', 'time', 'movie', 'first', 'big', 'twist', 'revealed', 'half-hour', 'left', 'caught', 'off-guard', 'good', 'way', 'final', 'scene', 'last', 'shot', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'omitted', 'film', 'purpose', 'much', 'what', 'went', 'previous', 'two', 'hours', 'might', 'even', 'make', 'lose', 'complete', 'respect', 'one', 'major', 'characters', 'Director', 'Alan', 'Parker', 'obviously', 'meant', 'shot', 'chill', 'will', 'probably', 'effect', 'initially', ""'re"", 'going', 'feel', 'cheated', 'credits', 'have', 'rolled']",N/A

Kevin Spacey plays a professor who is charged with the murder of a fellow colleague. The irony is that both he and the victim were activists against the death penalty. On death row for the murder, he sets up an interview by a reporter (Kate Hudson) for three days before the execution. When the interview is conducted, the reporter begins to have doubts about the guiltiness of David Gale. She then is in a race against time to try to prove what happened to Constance, his friend at the university.Common to popular belief, I don't think this movie was predictable. There are certainly many twists thrown in, and we expect these, but there seems to be a mystery surrounding other characters in the events leading up to her death. One of puzzling characters is Constance's friend, who is also a member of Death Watch (the name of the activist group against the death penalty). He seems to have a mysterious air about him and it is up to Bitsey (Winslet) and her assistant to uncover the truth of the murder and his role in it.Although there were many arguments, both for and against the death penalty, in the film, we should understand that this was part of the premise of the movie. These were included to show exactly who these characters were. This movie seems to be controversial in nature because of this, but I think that the story of Gale and the mysterious death of his friend Constance is the bigger mystery.An irking aspect of the film was the ""subliminal"" flashcards of themes, ideas and emotions that continually surfaced on the screen each time a big scene finished. It seemed to say that we, as an audience, we incapable of figuring out exactly how the characters should be feeling at that point in the movie. For instance, the film projects flashcards on the screen with words like ""emotion"", ""isolation"", ""sadness"", ""despair"", ""guilt"", after a sad scene. Words such as ""evil"", ""hate"", and ""ignorance"" would surface on a scene where one might feel anger.There were several far-fetched proponents of the film. For instance, Kate Hudson turning into a detective and piecing together every minute deal of information in a span of 72 hours a la Sherlock Holmes is a bit reaching. We have certainly seen the ""race against time"" theme before, although this film should be credited for at least making an attempt to steer clear of stereotyped characters. The twists certainly were effective in adding an aura of suspense, although some of the events that lead up to the final resolution are a little unbelievable.Still, I think this movie did its job as a thriller. Kate Winslet is convincing as a reporter who is swayed and cannot help but feel compassion for David Gale. Kevin Spacey fits David Gale perfectly.

Perhaps they are influenced by the reviews that came out in the media at the time of the film's theatrical release, perhaps the Editorial slam on the Product Page by Bret Fetzer taints opinion.  I would urge you to see and/or buy this DVD, keep an open mind, and witness the effect on your own emotional response.Kevin Spacey fleshes out the title role as a believable philosophy professor who speaks against capital punishment in the state of Texas which just happens to be the place where more executions are performed than any other state.  He is not without problems: alcohol, a drunken sexual relationship with a former student, and an awkward but deeply significant relationship with Constance (Laura Linney) who later when found 'murdered and raped' on videotape results in the arrest and conviction of Spacey's Gale, now facing death on death row.  Laura Linney is most credible as a driven anti-death penalty activist for reasons we discover are beyond the range of civil rights reponsibilty.  The third part of this triangle is the reporter brought in to investigate Gale's claim to innocence in the last four days of his wait on death row.  Kate Winslet captures all the parameters of this contemporary woman with seamless detail. To tell more of the story would be injurious to the unfolding of this worthwhile drama.For a 2 hour plus movie THE LIFE OF DAVID GALE manages to hold our interest, encouraging us as viewers to keep our invetigatory eyes and ears open and struggle along with Winslet and her cohort to finally put together all the pieces of the puzzle.  Others have complained that the clues are in every scene: isn't that true of most crime investigations?  I see no fault in placing all the information in front of the audience to test the observation of the viewer as much as the skill of the screenwriter in resolving a case with the important message of this film.  Alan Parker uses a lot of visual tricks in addressing the facts of the crime and even makes interesting parallels in the background music (the fairly obvious metaphor of TURANDOT arias by the presuicidal Liu appear repeatedly).In the end this story is on a par with DEAD MAN WALKING as far as a significant plea for anti-Capital Punishment voices.

I'm a bit undecided on the death penalty and I have to say this movie did not clear anything up for me, despite its obvious anti stance. (Its lack of showing any arguments whatsoever for the other side was its one flaw. The best movies about big debates let the viewer make up his or her own mind.) However, I feel the movie did make its point... in a certain way. You absolutely had to admire the dedication of the main characters. (Well, I've read the negative reviews which said they came across as nutcases, but David Gale gave up years of his life to his cause.) The only problem I saw with the twist at the end was that pro-death penalty advocates could argue that it was done on purpose. But they definitely made a statement, and you can't argue that.You will never forget the twist at the end. It was a big shock, if you didn't see it coming. And yet, the movie has re-watchability.The only other flaw I felt the movie had was, like so many movies today, they thought they needed to have not one but two explicit sex scenes. Well, the ""rape"" scene wasn't really explicit. But it was nasty and gross. Why?? Do people really enjoy watching these things? Yeah, I know some do. But they can go buy porn if they want to watch it. We don't need it in regular movies so all that is left is Disney (for now anyway). I read enough complaints here on Amazon to know sex is not as necessary to sell as they think it is.

610025,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B00005JLZN,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 3]","You may think this film is a thriller about the death penalty, but it is not. It looks like it, true, but the end reveals it is something completely different. It is about the way the media can be manipulated in any direction, provided you are intelligent. Once a brilliant university professor was confronted in a TV debate to the governor of Texas about the death penalty. The governor asked him to give the name of one executed person that was innocent and could be proved so. The professor could not answer such a question for the simple reason that there is no post mortem investigation in the case of an execution, except... And the professor started, with his main assistant in his fight against the death penalty, to think of how to prove that point. In the mean time he is tricked by some dumb girl student into doing exactly what he should never have done: have sex with her. She sue him for rape, even if later she will drop the charge. The damage is done. He is kicked out of academia. His wife takes his son away and gets a divorce. She sells the house. He cannot even get a job as the manager of a technical store. He is reduced to nothing, to being a rapist forever. But he does not want to move. His main assistant in his fight is going to die of leukemia. When he learns that, the plan to trap the governor germinates in their minds and they put it through. He is going to be accused of the murder of his assistant though it is not a murder. The evidence it is not is a tape, the recording of what really happened. But it will come in three pieces. The man will be sentenced to death. Three days before his execution he asks a famous journalist from New York to come and take the first and last interview he is going to give her in six hours spread out over the three days before his execution. The first excerpt of the tape we have mentioned will turn up in the journalist's motel room on the second day, before execution, too short and a copy. Worthless. Then after some adventure the journalist manages to recuperate what she thinks is the whole tape that proves what she was thinking, after some personal experimentation, is right: the woman killed herself, but who worked the camera? A man that is seen at the end of the tape, a man the journalist has seen here and there and in whose shack she has found the tape. But that too is too short though not worthless. It  creates havoc and it proves an innocent man can be sentenced to death. During that time the $500,000 for the interview travel to Mexico and the ex-wife for the son. The father had been vindicated in the mean time. But the journalist finally receives the last excerpt of the tape, the end of the suicidal demonstrative s&eacute;ance and there the professor is shown coming at this very moment, just after the death of the woman, just as if he had been behind the camera all the time and he turns that camera off, after checking the woman is dead. The media had been manipulated about the guilt of the man and about the fairness and justice of the death penalty, then about the man's innocence and the suicide of the woman, and yet the truth was that the death had been planned in such a way that the execution would demonstrate how an innocent person can be sentenced to death. Manipulation all along by a woman who wanted to make her natural death useful for the cause she advocated and by a man who did not have the courage to move on and start a new life after having been destroyed by an unscrupulous student and by his own dumbness: students are out of reach as long as they are within grading distance. He preferred to make his death (which becomes a very special suicide) useful for the cause he advocated and for his own son. But the film is short because two men helped the woman and staged her death and the man lied all along the way of his confession and ordeal. The media are so nave that they believe anything provided it smells slightly sulfurous or sulfuric.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID",4,Who likes being manipulated,1239840000,"04 16, 2009",2009,4077,"['may', 'think', 'film', 'thriller', 'death', 'penalty', 'not', 'true', 'end', 'something', 'completely', 'different', 'way', 'media', 'can', 'be', 'manipulated', 'direction', 'provided', 'are', 'intelligent', 'Once', 'brilliant', 'university', 'professor', 'was', 'confronted', 'TV', 'debate', 'governor', 'Texas', 'death', 'penalty', 'governor', 'asked', 'give', 'name', 'one', 'executed', 'person', 'was', 'innocent', 'could', 'be', 'proved', 'so', 'professor', 'could', 'not', 'answer', 'such', 'question', 'simple', 'reason', 'post', 'mortem', 'investigation', 'case', 'execution', 'professor', 'started', 'main', 'assistant', 'fight', 'death', 'penalty', 'think', 'how', 'prove', 'point', 'mean', 'time', 'tricked', 'dumb', 'girl', 'student', 'doing', 'exactly', 'what', 'should', 'never', 'have', 'done', 'have', 'sex', 'sue', 'rape', 'even', 'later', 'will', 'drop', 'charge', 'damage', 'done', 'kicked', 'academia', 'wife', 'son', 'away', 'divorce', 'house', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'get', 'job', 'manager', 'technical', 'store', 'reduced', 'nothing', 'being', 'rapist', 'forever', 'not', 'want', 'move', 'main', 'assistant', 'fight', 'going', 'die', 'leukemia', 'When', 'plan', 'trap', 'governor', 'germinates', 'minds', 'put', 'going', 'be', 'accused', 'murder', 'assistant', 'not', 'murder', 'evidence', 'not', 'tape', 'recording', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'will', 'come', 'three', 'pieces', 'man', 'will', 'be', 'sentenced', 'death', 'Three', 'days', 'execution', 'famous', 'journalist', 'New', 'York', 'come', 'take', 'first', 'last', 'interview', 'going', 'give', 'six', 'hours', 'spread', 'out', 'three', 'days', 'execution', 'first', 'excerpt', 'tape', 'have', 'mentioned', 'will', 'turn', 'up', 'journalist', 'motel', 'room', 'second', 'day', 'execution', 'too', 'short', 'copy', 'Worthless', 'Then', 'adventure', 'journalist', 'recuperate', 'what', 'whole', 'tape', 'what', 'was', 'thinking', 'personal', 'experimentation', 'right', 'woman', 'killed', 'who', 'worked', 'camera', 'man', 'seen', 'end', 'tape', 'man', 'journalist', 'seen', 'here', 'there', 'shack', 'found', 'tape', 'too', 'too', 'short', 'not', 'worthless', 'havoc', 'innocent', 'man', 'can', 'be', 'sentenced', 'death', 'time', '500,000', 'interview', 'travel', 'Mexico', 'ex-wife', 'son', 'father', 'had', 'been', 'vindicated', 'mean', 'time', 'journalist', 'finally', 'last', 'excerpt', 'tape', 'end', 'suicidal', 'demonstrative', 's', 'eacute', 'ance', 'professor', 'shown', 'coming', 'very', 'moment', 'just', 'death', 'woman', 'just', 'had', 'been', 'camera', 'time', 'camera', 'checking', 'woman', 'dead', 'media', 'had', 'been', 'manipulated', 'guilt', 'man', 'fairness', 'justice', 'death', 'penalty', 'then', 'man', 'innocence', 'suicide', 'woman', 'yet', 'truth', 'was', 'death', 'had', 'been', 'planned', 'such', 'way', 'execution', 'would', 'demonstrate', 'how', 'innocent', 'person', 'can', 'be', 'sentenced', 'death', 'Manipulation', 'all', 'along', 'woman', 'who', 'wanted', 'make', 'natural', 'death', 'useful', 'cause', 'advocated', 'man', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'courage', 'move', 'start', 'new', 'life', 'having', 'been', 'destroyed', 'unscrupulous', 'student', 'own', 'dumbness', 'students', 'are', 'reach', 'as', 'long', 'are', 'grading', 'distance', 'preferred', 'make', 'death', 'very', 'special', 'suicide', 'useful', 'cause', 'advocated', 'own', 'son', 'film', 'short', 'two', 'men', 'helped', 'woman', 'staged', 'death', 'man', 'lied', 'way', 'confession', 'ordeal', 'media', 'are', 'so', 'nave', 'believe', 'anything', 'provided', 'slightly', 'sulfurous', 'sulfuric.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Versailles', 'Saint', 'Quentin', 'Yvelines', 'CEGID']",N/A
610026,A1RECBDKHVOJMW,B00005JLZN,"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana""","[2, 3]","I did not view &quot;The Life of David Gale&quot; as a polemic on the death penalty. I wanted to watch a good drama, am a big fan of Kevin Spacey and Kate Winslet, and was definitely not disappointed in the movie or by the actors. I want to stress that, if anything, this film demonstrates what can happen, in extreme cases, when people become carried away by their passionate fervor, advocating for or against an issue. This film is a work of fiction, and to truly enjoy it one must relax and realize that it is only a story.David Gale, wonderfully portrayed by Kevin Spacey, is a brilliant philosophy professor at a major Texas university. He is a moral person, a strong and active opponent of the death penalty, a leader and organizer of Death Watch, and articulate and visible enough to debate the Governor of Texas on the issue of Capital Punishment. Gale is also an important and respected member of his community. Although it is not initially clear why his beautiful wife travels as frequently as she does, it appears that she is often away from home. He is clearly attached to his six year old son and is a wonderful, loving father.Through a bizarre series of events, Gale finds himself defending his honor and reputation in the very community that has long accepted him as a colleague and friend. As his life begins to fall apart, the already hard-drinking Gale, really hits the bottle Big Time! He makes a serious effort to clean up his act and regain his life, and is helped through this terrible time by his dear friend, colleague, and fellow Death Watch activist, Constance, (Laura Linney).Then fate steps in with a bizarre twist and Constance is found raped and horribly murdered on her kitchen floor. David Gale is accused, tried and convicted of the heinous crime. It is tragically ironic that a man who has dedicated himself to abolishing the death penalty, finds himself on Death Row, waiting for his own execution. He grants &quot;Bitsey&quot; Bloom, (Kate Winslet), a Pulitzer Prize-hungry journalist, three interviews, to take place on each of the three days prior to his execution. The story is told in a series of vivid, dramatically photographed flashbacks. The abrupt, disjointed, quick changing still shots of headlines, and images of the murder victim, interspersed with action shots, adds to the film's intentional sense of tension, and confusion. Perhaps this is the bewildering confusion an innocent person might feel when unjustly accused and convicted of a crime.Ms. Bloom soon realizes that the story she had planned to write, is not proceeding according to plan. As she is drawn into Gale's drama, she herself becomes a passionate advocate - for Gale, and for the truth. Bloom puts her safety on the line as she frantically races against the clock for the answers to Constance Hallaway's death.This is gripping suspense &amp; a ripping-good story. I found it difficult to hit the pause button on my remote when necessary. I did not foresee the ending, and I am usually pretty good at guessing &quot;what comes next.&quot; I understand that many people, may have wanted a political social action film with a strong message. This is not a &quot;strong message&quot; movie - it's a great thriller, with wonderful performances by an excellent cast. Writer Charles Randolph and director Alan Parker have done a good job of bringing this story to life, and while they will probably not be nominated for an Academy Award for their efforts, I certainly thank them for providing me with a few hours of nail-biting, riveting entertainment.JANA",4,A Riveting Drama With A Shocking Ending!

Wyatt ""ssintrepid""","[6, 6]","After watching this very good movie on DVD I would definitely have to say that it would've been nice to have watched it on the silver screen.  &quot;The Life of David Gale&quot; is a remarkably well told story that albeit fiction could very easily be a true story based on the convictions of those who agree with either side of the death penalty debate.  From the overall theme or premise of this story to the performances, &quot;The Life of David Gale&quot; is most definitely a very good story that falls into the category of films which makes you think your way through it.  Although many films in this particular genre suffer at the hands of predictability, this film doesn't in the least.Performance wise, Kevin Spacey does his normal great job of playing your somewhat average to just above average American in this film.  I believe that is what most people find appealing about his performances in major films; he's pretty much your average guy.  I believe that prior to watching this film the only thing I had ever watched Kate Winslet in was &quot;Titanic&quot; and we all know how well that worked out for this beautiful British actress.  Her performance in this film is a very good one; it would be nice to see her in future films.  Laura Linney does her usual job of great acting in this film as well.  No matter what films I've ever watched her in she always gives a compelling performance.Director Alan Parker does a wonderful job with this film from every aspect of telling this story.  The amazing thing about how he directed the film is that when it comes to the death penalty debate, he keeps the film itself neutral, not leaning too heavily in either direction, despite his own convictions.The Premise:Kevin Spacey plays David Gale who is a Harvard graduate working as a professor at a Texas university.  His life is about to take a major turn for the worse as his marriage is falling apart and he's accused of a rape he didn't commit.  Despite the rape charge being dropped he loses all credibility to include his job and his status as a leader of an anti death penalty organization.  He then finds himself being charged with and convicted for the murder of a close friend of his and he gets the death penalty...  Move forward six years and it's less than a week away from his execution and he finally decides to give an interview but only to Bitsey Bloom (Kate Winslet) who takes it upon herself to prove his innocence...What follows from there is a film that I would definitely recommend to any and all who are fans of films in this genre as the film is a highly intriguing and fairly suspenseful one.  {ssintrepid}Special Features:-Feature commentary with Director Alan Parker-Deleted scenes with optional Director's commentary-The Making of &quot;The Life of David Gale&quot;-The music of &quot;The Life of David Gale&quot;-DVD-ROM Features-Theatrical trailer",4,The Life of David Gale - A fairly suspenseful movie!,1078704000,"03 8, 2004",2004,2883,"['watching', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'DVD', 'would', 'definitely', 'have', 'say', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'watched', 'silver', 'screen', 'quot', 'Life', 'David', 'Gale', 'quot', 'remarkably', 'well', 'told', 'story', 'albeit', 'fiction', 'could', 'very', 'easily', 'be', 'true', 'story', 'based', 'convictions', 'who', 'agree', 'side', 'death', 'penalty', 'debate', 'overall', 'theme', 'premise', 'story', 'performances', 'quot', 'Life', 'David', 'Gale', 'quot', 'most', 'definitely', 'very', 'good', 'story', 'category', 'films', 'think', 'way', 'many', 'films', 'particular', 'genre', 'suffer', 'hands', 'predictability', 'film', ""n't"", 'least.Performance', 'wise', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'normal', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'somewhat', 'average', 'just', 'above', 'average', 'American', 'film', 'believe', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'find', 'appealing', 'performances', 'major', 'films', 'pretty', 'much', 'average', 'guy', 'believe', 'prior', 'watching', 'film', 'only', 'thing', 'had', 'ever', 'watched', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'was', 'quot', 'Titanic', 'quot', 'know', 'how', 'well', 'worked', 'out', 'beautiful', 'British', 'actress', 'performance', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'see', 'future', 'films', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'usual', 'job', 'great', 'acting', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'matter', 'what', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'watched', 'always', 'compelling', 'performance.Director', 'Alan', 'Parker', 'wonderful', 'job', 'film', 'aspect', 'telling', 'story', 'amazing', 'thing', 'how', 'directed', 'film', 'when', 'death', 'penalty', 'debate', 'film', 'neutral', 'not', 'leaning', 'too', 'heavily', 'direction', 'own', 'convictions.The', 'Premise', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'David', 'Gale', 'who', 'Harvard', 'graduate', 'working', 'professor', 'Texas', 'university', 'life', 'take', 'major', 'turn', 'worse', 'marriage', 'falling', 'apart', 'accused', 'rape', 'did', ""n't"", 'commit', 'rape', 'charge', 'being', 'dropped', 'credibility', 'include', 'job', 'status', 'leader', 'anti', 'death', 'penalty', 'organization', 'then', 'being', 'charged', 'convicted', 'murder', 'close', 'friend', 'death', 'penalty', 'Move', 'forward', 'six', 'years', 'less', 'week', 'away', 'execution', 'finally', 'give', 'interview', 'only', 'Bitsey', 'Bloom', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'who', 'prove', 'innocence', 'What', 'film', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'who', 'are', 'fans', 'films', 'genre', 'film', 'highly', 'intriguing', 'fairly', 'suspenseful', 'one', 'ssintrepid', 'Special', 'Features', '-Feature', 'commentary', 'Director', 'Alan', 'Parker-Deleted', 'scenes', 'optional', 'Director', 'commentary-The', 'Making', 'quot', 'Life', 'David', 'Gale', 'quot', '-The', 'music', 'quot', 'Life', 'David', 'Gale', 'quot', 'Features-Theatrical', 'trailer']",N/A

610043,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00005JLZN,Lawyeraau,"[1, 3]","This is a terrific film, as are so many of the films in which Kevin Spacey stars. This film is about death penalty opponent fanatic, David Gayle (Kevin Spacey), whose life careens out of control once he has an unfortunate sexual interlude with a provocative student from the college in which he is a professor.Having lost his teaching career and family over the incident and seeing his high profile role in the politics of death penalty issues consequently disappear,  he ends up accused of the rape and horrific murder of Constance Harraway (Laura Linney). Constance was David's fellow death penalty opponent fanatic and best friend, the one who stood by him through thick and thin and helped him try to regain control of his life.Tried and convicted for her rape and murder, David is ironically now an inmate on death row. He grants an ambitious reporter, Bitsey Bloom (Kate Winslet), an interview just days before his execution. As his story unfolds,  revealed in a series of flashbacks leading to the final denouement, Bitsey begins to believe that David might be innocent. She begins to investigate and put together the pieces of the enigma that is David Gayle.Kevin Spacey is terrific in the role of David Gayle, a man who went from being on top of the world to being at the bottom of the heap. He is a man who has lost all that he holds most dear, including a relationship with his beloved young son, all because of a mistake in judgment that caused him to take the wrong fork in the road of life. It is the story of a man whose life has spiraled downward, and who has given in to despair. He uses his ideological commitment as succor, ultimately seeking absolution in martyrdom.Laura Linney is excellent as David's devoted friend and fellow activist, who  sticks by him through thick and thin. She infuses the role with a certain firmness of character and quiet dedication. Hers is an activism born of measured conviction in contrast to David's more flamboyant, confrontational stance on the issue for which they share a passion. Her own personal waterloo provides the film with some lovely bittersweet moments.Kate Winslet handles her role as the intrepid reporter with great aplomb, providing the role with a nice contemporary feel and infusing the character with a respectable American accent. Despite all this, however, she takes a back seat to Spacey and Linney in the film. Matt Craven is perfectly cast as the mysterious Dusty Wright, the cowboy whose dedication to the anti-death penalty cause goes above and beyond the call of duty.This is not, however,  a film about the death penalty. Consequently, as a death penalty issues film, it fails, as the film paints both sides of this hot button issue in an unflattering light. It is, therefore, not a propaganda film and those looking for such will, inevitably, be disappointed. As a whodunit, however, it succeeds brilliantly, as the plot is complex and filled with enough twists and turns and red herrings to delight even the most jaded mystery aficionado.This is a film that focuses on an unhappy man, who has lost all that he holds dear, and a  decision that he makes about what to do with his life. Right or wrong, it is that decision that fuels the film and makes for some gripping cinematic moments. This film now completes a magnificent triad of films about troubled men for gifted director Alan Parker (Angel Heart, Midnight Express).This is a film that one can certainly watch again and again due to its complexity.

Then after you have watched it and figured it out, see if the movie self-destructs unbelievably!Nicholas Cage co-produced this movie and originally had intended to star in it.  2-time Oscar winner Kevin Spacey (""The Usual Suspects"" & ""American Beauty"") does a great job of making the film interesting.  His studied focus throughout the film is only somewhat at odds with an alcoholic's penchant for erratic behavior.  When he takes student Berlin played by Rhona Mitra (Sweet Home Alabama & Get Carter) in a bathroom from behind, one wonders how low the film can go!  But doubt not, it goes lower than that!Former philosophy teacher & 1st-time screenwriter Charles Randolph throws in a plethora of plot twists & cliches.  Kate Winslet's tiger reporter character is named ""Bitsy Bloom.""  One wonders why.  One can keep wondering; she had to be called something, no matter how odd the name.  A rose by any other name smells as sweet; and Kate looks pretty good despite sporting a hairstyle from Budget Cuts.  She plays this one-note performance with the skill and energy of a master musician furiously banging a B flat from a one-note song.  She is determined; and even has her car malfunction at just the wrong time!  While she won't add to her 3 Oscar nominations (""Sense & Sensibility,"" ""Iris,"" ""Titanic""), she is still a pleasure to watch.Laura Linney who had a Best Actress nomination in 2000 for ""You Can Count on Me"" does a wonderful job as Constance Harraway, the devoted member of Deathwatch, and anti-Capital punishment group.  The film gets a sad note of irony as the character suffers from an apparently fatal case of leukemia.  However, as she writhes and screams on the floor with a bag on her head in a mysteriously delivered video, one only wonders if Alan Parker used a body double.My favorite performance in the movie was by Matt Craven (Dragonfly) as Dusty Wright, the cowboy Deathwatch member that Bitsy suspects of the crime.  He has a haunting role with few words that makes one wonder what ""The Life of David Gale"" could have been like as a silent movie.  Gabriel Mann as Bitsey's assistant Zack Stemmons does a great job of sassing and being supportive.  Leon Rippy (The Patriot, Universal Soldier) as lawyer Braxton Belyeu is wonderfully creepy.It's been a long time since Alan Parker was nominated for Best Director, ""Midnight Express"" [1978] & ""Mississippi Burning"" [1988].  ""The Life of David Gale"" is well paced, with good performances by the cast.  Ultimately, this is not a movie about capital punishment, however.  It is a mystery tale that uses the theme to its own ends, rather unsuccessfully.  It boils down to whether it's believable for someone to kill herself & himself to prove it can be done.Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to watch this DVD for the good performances; and then let it go.

However, that is only the barest of outlines of this rather complex and provocative film.  There's more to this story than meets the eye and there's a real mystery here.  The plot is full of surprises, and the film kept me up way past my bedtime with my eyes wide open in order to see how it all  turned out.Kevin Spacey does a fantastic job as the man waiting for execution.  It's the kind of role we've come to know him for  --a troubled and bitter person who life has kicked in the teeth.  He's a former philosophy professor who's lost his job and his credibility as a director of the anti-death penalty organization he directs.  Now, he's been convicted of the murder of a co-worker at that organization, Laura Linney.  After six years on death row, he's now about to be executed.  However, just a few days before the execution, he contacts a reporter, Kate Winslet, known for her feistiness as well as her integrity.Through flashbacks, we learn his story. Winslet is convinced of his innocence.  However, the story is not as simple as that.  Most of the time I was at the edge of my seat and totally involved in the well-developed characterizations of the main characters as the plot twisted and turned and eventually led to a conclusion that took me by surprise.  In addition, the film had a message, but it was buried in the story in such a way that it never seemed preachy.I really enjoyed the film.  It was set in Texas and the sense of place was wonderful as was the good pacing and fine acting.

I do not believe it was his intention to die for the cause, it's just that the darn car broke down!The way the film unfolds is that until the very end, we think the cowboy (Craven) did it, Spacey was incorrectly put to death, and the film is anti CP. Ah, now the surprise ending, Spacey was involved, so the system worked...pro CP, right? Not really...this was more of a mercy killing due to Linney's illness, not first degree murder.The truth is that the film is neither, it is merely illustrating that this is not a black and white issue, and that each case has it's own set of unique circumstances.

Sadly, while she's a great actress and does her best, ""the Life of David Gale"" sinks because of various flaws and premises.&lt;general criticisms>The movie wears its politics on its sleeve to put it mildly.  Cracks like, ""You can tell you're in the bible belt by the fact that there are more prisons than Starbucks"" and referring to the Governor of Texas (a stand-in for George W. Bush) as a ""frat boy"" abound.&lt;the cast>Kate Winslet continues to show that she can do a convincing American accent.  This being said, she came across as a bit too young and ""soft"" to be a tough, aggressive prize winning journalist.  Also, whoever gave her character the first name of ""Bitsey"" was an idiot. I can't imagine a journalist going by that name being taken seriously by anyone.Kevin Spacey has a commanding presence, and I found him very believable as a philosophy professor and fanatical ideologue who had his life fall apart because one mistake.Laura Linney did a good job playing Kevin Spacey's fellow activist.The ex-student who seduced David Gale and accused him of raping her was very sexy, but I thought she was a little too mature to be even a graduate student.The actor playing the Governor had an unenviable job of playing a caricature.  I can only contrast it with the way that ""Dead Man Walking"" depicted people who supported the death penalty.  Those characters came across as ""real people""...not the product of fevered imagination of people on one side of the political debate.&lt;the plot>I thought that it was a little too implausible that David Gale would be one moment falling down drunk at the party where he was falsely accused of rape, and the next moment making vigorous love to the hot ex-student.Another laughable flaw in the story line was how they telegraphed that Bitsey Bloom's car was going to break down at a critical moment.  The idea that she wouldn't have gotten one that was working properly was ludicrous.Watching this movie one would be left thinking that the only reason why we have the death penalty in the US is because evil politicians have forced it on us.  That's not right.  Instead, we have it because by a large majority, Americans support the death penalty and its constitutionality has been affirmed over and over again by the courts.&lt;the premise> &lt;spoilers>The premise of the movie is that David Gale and his colleague (Laura Linney's character) could not come up with a good response to the challenge, ""Name one innocent man put to death in Texas.""  So they decided to create such a case.  Laura Linney's character was dying of cancer, so she did not value her life.  David Gale was a driven, embittered fanatic who didn't value his so much either.So they made it look like David Gale brutally raped and murdered her and they allowed what one Supreme Court justice has called the ""machinery of death"" take over.  David Gale was duly convicted of rape and murder and sentenced to die.Enter Bitsey Bloom.  Gale and his friends chose her to break the story after Gale's execution.  This story was that Gale did not rape and murder his friend and that the State of Texas did wrongly execute an innocent man.Supposedly, this news story --which would be a blockbuster-- caused a 17 point drop in support for the death penalty.But in my humble opinion, the reaction of many Americans would be ""What fanatics Gale and his friend were!""  It would not be ""Wow, I never realized how wrong the death penalty was before.""Think about it.  Gale and his friend basically entered into an elaborate conspiracy to obstruct justice with the intent of framing someone...only their target was David Gale.  They are the ones who were responsible for Gale getting convicted, sentenced to death, and executed.  The system didn't ""fail"" because of the system's faults.  The system failed because of what they did.  It wouldn't have happened if it hadn't been for them.  Gale may not have been guilty of rape and murder, but he was guilty of committing suicide using death row as the weapon.Bottom Line:  ""The Life of David Gale"" has an interesting premise but in the end, it all amounts to the sort of cheap theatrics that the anti-death penalty crowd so frequently engage in...arguing that someone is completely innocent and blameless when the evidence ultimately proves him otherwise.",2,Badly Flawed Polemic Against the Death Penalty,1250467200,"08 17, 2009",2009,4684,"['did', ""n't"", 'see', 'movie', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'largely', 'knew', 'was',

Whether he's dying/killing for a greater cause, to get rich, or, to become infamous, he's always the guy who knows better than everyone else.  The movies I am referring to are ""The Life of David Gale,"" ""The Usual Suspects,"" and ""Se7en.""  Of course ,""American Beauty"" and ""K-Pax"" are other variations on this theme.In 'The Life of David Gale"" (TLODG) Spacey again puts on the genius  mask, the predictable mannerisms, and just the right amount of alligator tear to hoax the audience into a plot twist.  It's getting to the point where we expect a twist, a shock, a surprise, whenever Spacey shows up on screen.  I can no longer see his face and believe he is who he's pretending to be.  It's a sign of impending predictability and eventual boredom.  Watch out Mr. Spacey, your career may be sacrificed next.TLODG is the perfect vehicle for Spacey.  All he had to do for this one was to appear like Hannibal, but alot [weaker].  On the other hand, I can't say enough good things things about Laura Linney and Kate Winslett.  Their performances were strong and convincing.  Indeed, their performances in this movie had to be strong, given the over-wrought script.  Granted, the death penalty issue is philosophically, legally, and spiritually challenging, but this story is simply way over the top.  ...  Their scheme is good drama but far removed from reality based arguments against the death penalty.  Alan Parker has a knack for such over-dramatized stories.  He is a good director and knows how to effectively manipulate the audience's emotions and allegiance, but, viewed through the retrospectoscope, he will probably be noted for his  cinematic hysterionics rather than for his artistry.  TLODG has enjoyed mass market appeal while remaining a critical failure for exactly this reason; texture but no taste.1 star for performances, 1 for direction, and 1 for overall entertainment value, but that is all and there is no more.

In actuality, it was very easy to figure out, if you just paid attention. The second time I watched this film was also in theatre's and I was on a date. When the movie ended, my date turned to me and said SO DAVID GALE DID KILL HIS FRIEND AFTER ALL. That made me so mad. He completely and utterly missed the point of the entire film. How stupid can you be. The ending revealed all your questions. David never killed his collegue. She was terminally ill, and the three of them, including david which the last tape that he sent to bitzy at the end clearly showed) they all conspired to set up david, to show that the system is flawed and the death penalty executed an innocent man. Their careers were dedicated to the anti death penalty issue, and they had a difficult time getting their points across when they were alive, so dying for what they believed in is what they all decided to do. Except for the cowboy. She killed herself, because she was dying anyway, and she felt it important to die demonstrating the flaws in the system. They proved it was very easy to set up a person who was innocent, and very easy for the system to make a mistake by executing an innocent person. It's as simple as that. One critic called this film MORALLY BANKRUPT. But he obviously wasnt paying attention to what the movie was really about. The compassion of human beings being given the death penalty, and to preserve life, even when a person has been convicted. The fact that they are still human beings. That's not morality?

I actually thought the script was the strong point of the movie almost holding up to other thrillers of the same ilk, &quot;Memento,&quot; and &quot;Dead Man Walking,&quot; come to mind.  However where the weakness lies is in the acting.Interesting that a director seems to have such great influence across the board on the acting of any given cast members.  Take other movies that have great actors turning in semi-terrible performances, Star Wars prequels and Samuel L. Jackson and Liam Neeson and you will understand the point.  Laura Linney, Kate Winslet, and Kevin Spacey are all terrifically nuanced and artful actors but here the performances just aren't believable.  You can tell the actors are trying to act, instead of just presenting believable performances that puts the viewer gazing into the window of their world.  Spacey is the only one that really rises above the mediocre din of performances that director Alan Parker conjures.In my mind I am comparing this movie, oddly enough, to Michael Moore's &quot;Bowling for Columbine,&quot; and find &quot;The Life of David Gale,&quot; the better of the two.  I believe both scripts were written with liberal political messages in mind.  David Gale being anti-capital punishment, Columbine anti-gun violence.  David Gale gets it more right.The story involves a group of anti-execution activists and the journalist (Kate Winslet) that has access to death row inmate Gale (Kevin Spacey) for a last week interview session to get the story right.  And get the story right she does, though the movies twists and turns leaves you guessing up to the end.  I felt the movie tried to explain too much and would have benefited from a simpler approach, but was intrigued to find out just where it was headed.There are some graphic scenes that are hard to watch, but in the end it leaves you thinking about the death penalty and the Texas approach to justice and leaves you with questions...What if?",4,Hmmm...Interesting Life...Interesting Reviews,1073174400,"01 4, 2004",2004,2002,"['quot', 'Life', 'David', 'Gale', 'quot', 'just', 'short', 'actually', 'thought', 'script', 'was', 'strong', 'point', 'movie', 'almost', 'holding', 'up', 'other', 'thrillers', 'same', 'ilk', 'quot', 'Memento', 'quot', 'quot', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Walking', 'quot', 'come', 'mind', 'However', 'where', 'weakness', 'acting.Interesting', 'director', 'have', 'such', 'great', 'influence', 'board', 'acting', 'given', 'cast', 'members', 'Take', 'other', 'movies', 'have', 'great', 'actors', 'turning', 'semi-terrible', 'performances', 'Star', 'Wars', 'prequels', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'will', 'understand', 'point', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'are', 'terrifically', 'nuanced', 'artful', 'actors', 'here', 'performances', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'believable', 'can', 'tell', 'actors', 'are', 'trying', 'act', 'instead', 'just', 'presenting', 'believable', 'performances', 'viewer', 'gazing', 'window', 'world', 'Spacey', 'only', 'one', 'really', 'mediocre', 'din', 'performances', 'director', 'Alan', 'Parker', 'conjures.In', 'mind', 'am', 'comparing', 'movie', 'oddly', 'enough', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'quot', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'quot', 'find', 'quot', 'Life', 'David', 'Gale', 'quot', 'better', 'two', 'believe', 'scripts', 'were', 'written', 'liberal', 'political', 'messages', 'mind', 'David', 'Gale', 'being', 'anti-capital', 'punishment', 'Columbine', 'anti-gun', 'violence', 'David', 'Gale', 'more', 'right.The', 'story', 'group', 'anti-execution', 'activists', 'journalist', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'access', 'death', 'row', 'inmate', 'Gale', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'last', 'week', 'interview', 'session', 'get', 'story', 'right', 'get', 'story', 'right', 'movies', 'twists', 'leaves', 'guessing', 'up', 'end', 'felt', 'movie', 'tried', 'explain', 'too', 'much', 'would', 'have', 'benefited', 'simpler', 'approach', 'was', 'intrigued', 'find', 'out', 'just', 'where', 'was', 'are', 'graphic', 'scenes', 'are', 'hard', 'watch', 'end', 'thinking', 'death', 'penalty', 'Texas', 'approach', 'justice', 'questions', 'What']",N/A

However, this movie came to me through a DVD circulation club, and the reviews from the group said that this movie was fantastic.  So my husband and I sat down with it shortly after receiving it.The movie captivated me.  At first, I kept picturing Kevin Spacey's character as the same person from &quot;Pay It Forward,&quot; which I also greatly enjoyed.  And Kate Winslet I had just seen in &quot;Quills,&quot; so I just couldn't get over the fact that this was the same person as that (new respect for her -- no longer the damsel in distress from Titanic and Quills).But then, I got caught up in the storyline.  Now, I half-guessed the end (which always gives me the extra thrill -- when it's not TOO blatant; I like playing couch potato Columbo).  However, when I woke up in the middle of the night still thinking about this movie, I knew it had struck a chord.  For me, this was a fine piece of cinema - a book brought to life.Now for the bad news:  I was disappointed to learn that contrary to popular belief, the story was not a true one.  This always adds something to a movie like this.  I wanted to compare it to Dead Man Walking (I still will -- much better).But if you like a good drama, I recommend giving this one a try.  Now that I've seen the movie, I found some negative reviews (not so hard to find them).  I maintain that I really enjoyed the movie and did not see any plot holes or hypocrisies, although I can see where those reviewers are coming from.

To say any more would give too much away, but I wound up enjoying this movie, despite a very ordinary first twenty minutes.To my horror, I subsequently discovered the movie had been almost universally panned by the critics as shallow, formulaic and manipulative: perhaps I have been manipulated by the formula (I concede that at times I am a little shallow), but I stand by my judgment.In small ways, the movie is definitely clumsy, and it certainly wouldn't merit inclusion in any cinematic hall of fame. The opening scenarios - at Gale's university and Bitsey Bloom's newdesk (Bitsey Bloom - what kind of a name is that?), prior to the events of the film - are poorly scripted and acted, and throughout the rest of the film there is some very obvious, clich?d religious imagery - Gale lies on a lawn as if crucified, and swings from a tree as if he were Judas (or should this be St. Jude the patron saint of lost causes?) - but this doesn't really detract from the overall impression of a well constructed, effective movie.And it has a cracker of a finale.

If you guessed Bruce Willis was a ghost, knock a star of this review. Read this next statement carefully if you want to see this thing. All depends on it.Kevin Spacey plays a professor who is against the death penalty because he believes it is faulty and there is a margin for error where innocent people may be executed. He has been sentenced to death for the murder of his anti-death penalty activist friend who was dying from Leukemia. He calls up a journalist - Kate Winslet, to come visit him on death row, three days before his execution to help prove his innocents.To be honest if you have not figured out the silly plot twist by now then add a star to this review and go watch it. Half way through this movie me and my friend had to sit out the remaining hour to see our suspicions unfold. I am sure many of you will be doing this too.Silly plot twist and glaring Swiss cheese holes aside - this is actually one of Spacey's better parts to date and he is back doing what he does best. Here he is a cross between American Beauty and Seven. He does perform extremely well on the screen and does some really good drunk acting. The script's dialogue is actually very witty and thoroughly enjoyable. However Kate Winslet does not really pull it off in the American gal department and when she starts crying towards the end, the film is lost. There is also some very silly emotional heart string tugging moments that do not work well. However for every bad scene there is actually a brilliant one. You will enjoy quite a lot about this movie. However when it's bad, it is a real stinker. The brain department in this movie is not on form most of the time and for some reason I came away feeling that the film thinks that it is a lot smarter than what it really is. And maybe that is where the problem is at.So this movie is basically the benchmark for all 3 star movies. When it is good there comes along a bad piece to neutralize it again. When it is bad there is good piece to revive it. However when all is said and done it is more than a little bit silly and certainly goes in the direction of farce. What sounds like a good idea on paper, may not actually work out that well on the screen and here The Life of David Gale is a prime example of a bingo twist idea actually blown out of all proportion and certainly leaving the stratosphere for a taste of that pie in the sky. Seeing Kate Winslet's investigative journalist actually having to recreate a death scene in order to figure it out only begs the question - why didn't she get it sooner? Why didn't the judge see it sooner? Why didn't the jury see it sooner? And why did the pro-death penalty supporters not see it coming?I'm telling you right now the twist is like disco lights just under one hour into the film. Up until then it started quite good.

Gosh, just look and listen.  Try to be impartial, even though there may be a message; albeit forced-fed at times to the viewer (Libs and Cons take note).The more I see great acting (like that of the principals in this movie), the more I appreciate how much work actors put into their characters and how hard it is to ""stay in character"" as the filming goes on for weeks or months.

Another GOOD REASON for death penalty is that (almost) no one ever complained about the way dogs with rabies are dealt with, so why insist on considering mad dogs standing on their hind legs are human : just remember what Konrad Lorenz said 'The missing link between ape and man is US', so, those who don't want to behave as human beings should not be regarded as such, and therefore should not benefit of any human status.

Zwick,"[19, 38]","""The Life of David Gale"" is an equal opportunity offender in that it makes both those who support and those who oppose the death penalty look equally venal, conniving and foolish.  I don't think that was the INTENTION of writer Charles Randolph and director Alan Parker - since the theme of the film is based on the premise that an innocent man can indeed be falsely executed - but that is the unfortunate impression we are left with once the bizarre plot twists and convolutions have played themselves out.It is four days before David Gale (Kevin Spacey), an ex-college professor convicted of raping and killing a female colleague (Laura Linney), is scheduled for execution.  The twist is that Gale used to be one of the most vocal opponents against capital punishment in all of Texas, and now he is on Death Row.  Catch the irony?  Gale has decided to open up to a single reporter, ""Bitsey"" Bloom (Kate Winslet), in an attempt to have her go out and prove his innocence, if not for his own sake, at least for the sake of his young son.  The film becomes a typical race-against-time melodrama with Bitsey and her cohort, intern reporter Zack (Gabriel Mann), piecing together the clues as to what actually happened on that fateful day years earlier, in an effort to stave off the inevitable while the clock ticks down and the wheels of Texas justice grind inexorably on.""The Life of David Gale"" is a reasonably entertaining thriller provided you don't apply too much common sense or logic to the matters at hand.  In fact, the film's admittedly absurd plot contrivances do manage to keep us guessing most of the way through.  Spacey, Winslet and Linney give it their all, even if that means occasionally going over the top to match the overheated nature of the material they have to work with.  My biggest complaint with the film is that the overly clever denouement, though it serves its purpose as an acceptable ""shocker,"" really undercuts the entire film we have just sat through since it turns Gale into a complete and utter liar in terms of everything he has said up to that point.  What purpose is served by having him pour out this tale of innocence to Bitsey if he knows she is going to find out the truth later on anyway?  It's really a case of a convicted man inflicting cruel and unusual punishment on an innocent party who just wants to help him.  (Protecting the son's memory of him seems a tenuous reason at best).  Besides, the duplicity underlying the abolitionists' actions would more likely turn the general public AGAINST their cause than win it many new converts.  Even though the filmmakers' sympathies obviously lie with those upholding the anti-capital punishment position, the ""sincere"" protestors depicted in the film don't always seem like the sharpest tools in the shed.""The Life of David Gale"" has its moments as social drama fantasy, but for a real, serious study of the death penalty issue, check out the great ""Dead Man Walking"" instead.",2,unintended consequences,1046044800,"02 24, 2003",2003,2968,"['Life', 'David', 'Gale', 'equal', 'opportunity', 'offender', 'who', 'support', 'who', 'oppose', 'death', 'penalty', 'look', 'equally', 'venal', 'conniving', 'foolish', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'INTENTION', 'writer', 'Charles', 'Randolph', 'director', 'Alan', 'Parker', 'theme', 'film', 'based', 'premise', 'innocent', 'man', 'can', 'indeed', 'be', 'falsely', 'executed', 'unfortunate', 'impression', 'are', 'left', 'once', 'bizarre', 'plot', 'twists', 'convolutions', 'have', 'played', 'four', 'days', 'David', 'Gale', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'ex-college', 'professor', 'convicted', 'raping', 'killing', 'female', 'colleague', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'scheduled', 'execution', 'twist', 'Gale', 'used', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'vocal', 'opponents', 'capital', 'punishment', 'Texas', 'now', 'Death', 'Row', 'Catch', 'irony', 'Gale', 'decided', 'open', 'up', 'single', 'reporter', 'Bitsey', 'Bloom', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'attempt', 'have', 'go', 'out', 'prove', 'innocence', 'not', 'own', 'sake', 'least', 'sake', 'young', 'son', 'film', 'typical', 'race-against-time', 'melodrama', 'Bitsey', 'cohort', 'intern', 'reporter', 'Zack', 'Gabriel', 'Mann', 'piecing', 'together', 'clues', 'what', 'actually', 'happened', 'fateful', 'day', 'years', 'earlier', 'effort', 'stave', 'off', 'inevitable', 'clock', 'ticks', 'down', 'wheels', 'Texas', 'justice', 'grind', 'inexorably', 'Life', 'David', 'Gale', 'reasonably', 'entertaining', 'thriller', 'provided', 'do', ""n't"", 'apply', 'too', 'much', 'common', 'sense', 'logic', 'matters', 'hand', 'fact', 'film', 'admittedly', 'absurd', 'plot', 'contrivances', 'do', 'manage', 'keep', 'guessing', 'most', 'way', 'Spacey', 'Winslet', 'Linney', 'give', 'even', 'occasionally', 'going', 'top', 'match', 'overheated', 'nature', 'material', 'have', 'work', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'film', 'overly', 'clever', 'denouement', 'purpose', 'acceptable', 'shocker', 'really', 'entire', 'film', 'have', 'just', 'sat', 'Gale', 'complete', 'utter', 'liar', 'terms', 'everything', 'said', 'up', 'point', 'What', 'purpose', 'served', 'having', 'pour', 'out', 'tale', 'innocence', 'Bitsey', 'going', 'find', 'out', 'truth', 'later', 'anyway', 'really', 'case', 'convicted', 'man', 'inflicting', 'cruel', 'unusual', 'punishment', 'innocent', 'party', 'who', 'just', 'help', 'Protecting', 'son', 'memory', 'tenuous', 'reason', 'best', 'duplicity', 'underlying', 'abolitionists', 'actions', 'would', 'more', 'likely', 'turn', 'general', 'public', 'AGAINST', 'cause', 'win', 'many', 'new', 'converts', 'Even', 'filmmakers', 'sympathies', 'obviously', 'lie', 'upholding', 'anti-capital', 'punishment', 'position', 'sincere', 'protestors', 'depicted', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'seem', 'sharpest', 'tools', 'shed', 'Life', 'David', 'Gale', 'moments', 'social', 'drama', 'fantasy', 'real', 'serious', 'study', 'death', 'penalty', 'issue', 'check', 'out', 'great', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Walking', 'instead']",N/A

I promise to watch my step, but if you want to be surprised at the lame ""twist"" then stop reading.Alright, here it is. David Gale, a devout anti-death-penalty advocate finds himself on death row for the murder of his close friend and one-time fling. It seems like an open and shut case, but David is swearing his innocence and says he's being framed, which catches the attention of ""Bitsey"" Bloom (now there's a name that just commands respect)Anyway, the film chases its own tail for a little and, after a while, it's insinuated that David may have made himself LOOK guilty just to attract attention to the cause by becoming some kind of martyr.See ... here's the problem, two-thirds of the way into the movie the film's story paints itself into a corner it can't get out of. What we're left with as the film begins to reach its 'big reveal' are two different directions the plot can take to resolve itself:1. David is actually innocent of the crime, and tampered with the evidence to make himself look guilty - This doesn't make any sense because he's disproving his own argument. If he subverted the justice system to make himself look guilty and he's then convicted, isn't that proof that the system works? 'The System' isn't cheating Gale, Gale's cheating the system by tampering with his own trial to get the verdict he wants. How can this then be held up as proof that the death-penalty is wrong?2. David actually did it - In which case he was convicted of murder and is sitting on death row. This, if true, means we've wasted two hours of our time watching Kevin Spacey over-act.The thing is, neither of these scenarios work. In either option, David SHOULD be on death row; he either doctored his trail to get himself there or he's actually a murderer.The film was CLEARLY trying to make a statement about the injustice of capital punishment, but in the process only managed to (pardon the pun) shoot itself in the foot and discredit its own argument.",1,Utter Garbage ...,1126656000,"09 14, 2005",2005,2033,"['only', 'way', 'make', 'point', 'possibly', 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'promise', 'watch', 'step', 'want', 'be', 'surprised', 'lame', 'twist', 'then', 'stop', 'reading.Alright', 'here', 'David', 'Gale', 'devout', 'anti-death-penalty', 'advocate', 'death', 'row', 'murder', 'close', 'friend', 'one-time', 'fling', 'open', 'shut', 'case', 'David', 'swearing', 'innocence', 'being', 'framed', 'attention', 'Bitsey', 'Bloom', 'now', 'name', 'just', 'respect', 'Anyway', 'film', 'own', 'tail', 'little', 'while', 'insinuated', 'David', 'may', 'have', 'made', 'LOOK', 'guilty', 'just', 'attract', 'attention', 'cause', 'becoming', 'kind', 'martyr.See', 'here', 'problem', 'two-thirds', 'way', 'movie', 'film', 'story', 'paints', 'corner', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'What', ""'re"", 'left', 'film', 'reach', ""'big"", 'reveal', 'are', 'two', 'different', 'directions', 'plot', 'can', 'take', 'resolve', 'itself:1', 'David', 'actually', 'innocent', 'crime', 'tampered', 'evidence', 'make', 'look', 'guilty', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'disproving', 'own', 'argument', 'subverted', 'justice', 'system', 'make', 'look', 'guilty', 'then', 'convicted', ""n't"", 'proof', 'system', 'System', ""n't"", 'cheating', 'Gale', 'Gale', 'cheating', 'system', 'tampering', 'own', 'trial', 'get', 'verdict', 'How', 'can', 'then', 'be', 'held', 'up', 'proof', 'death-penalty', 'wrong', '2', 'David', 'actually', 'did', 'case', 'was', 'convicted', 'murder', 'sitting', 'death', 'row', 'true', ""'ve"", 'wasted', 'two', 'hours', 'time', 'watching', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'over-act.The', 'thing', 'scenarios', 'work', 'option', 'David', 'SHOULD', 'be', 'death', 'row', 'either', 'doctored', 'trail', 'get', 'there', 'actually', 'murderer.The', 'film', 'was', 'CLEARLY', 'trying', 'make', 'statement', 'injustice', 'capital', 'punishment', 'process', 'only', 'managed', 'pardon', 'pun', 'shoot', 'foot', 'discredit', 'own', 'argument']",N/A
610077,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B00005JLZN,Samuel McKewon,"[23, 45]","""The Life of David Gale"" fashions a staged rape as a warm-up and an the reenactment of a brutal crime as an encore. The center ring is a real treat -- the crime itself, a woman handcuffed and stripped naked, left to suffocate with a plastic bag taped around her throat.What a cruel, despicable movie. It pretends to be about anti-death penalty activists and the lengths to which they will go to prove their point that the death penalty is wrong, but it is not a point that should be made by the activists, nor the movie. The death penalty is too important an issue to be tied up in such a crude, mean-spirited thriller.Kevin Spacey barely registers as David Gale, a former University of Texas professor and leader of Deathwatch, who is now slated to get the death penalty for the murder of Deathwatch colleague Constance Holloway (Laura Linney). Gale, a brilliant, often drunk hothead, got put on the world's disavowed list after being falsely accused of rape by a expelled grad student. The fake rape itself is a real treat, shown in all its brutal glory. Gale's wife, a philanderer herself, nonetheless takes the opportunity to stick it to him, taking Gale's son to Spain -- Gale will never see him again -- and e-mailing him to ask for a divorce. ""P.S."" the note says, ""I'm selling the house.""About that point I'm thinking, oh boy. But then Gale, who was a tenured professor and must have saved up some money along the way, moves into a tenement apartment building, complete with a pool filled with mud, where he spends his days calling Spain again and again and again. Uh-huh.How Constance dies, and why, you can discover, if you wish. There is little doubt as Gale's fate on the row, nor his role in Constance's death, if you're paying much attention. What's so offensive is that the movie makes all of this seem honorable, which it is most certainly not, and does so by playing up the miseries of Gale's life beyond any reasonable standard, and squeezing a little harder for effect.Spacey plays Gale like a fool. No subtlety here; it's like he means to act as he's being informed by the tag team K-Pax and Verbal on how to do it. Once the whole truth is ""revealed,"" you understand the performance, but you don't admire it. The reverse is true for Laura Linney, who bravely plays a sad, sweet, caring, forgiving school marm who makes a decision we cannot possibly comprehend. Was she crazy? Influenced? We don't know. The movie, because it is not about her choice but about throwing smoke into the moviegoers eyes, will not discuss it.I have not mentioned Kate Winslet. She plays the reporter to whom Gale tells his story; she is essentially used in a sickening, cruel way. I am not sure what she is doing in this movie, a slave to the idiocy of her role, going to and fro like a plot puppet.I love Kate Winslet.She is a master at divining the center of a role -- much like Meryl Streep -- and seeing that core through; she creates three dimensions where there have only been one to begin with. She can play lead, she can support, she can sidekick; there are few actors better at filling in the blanks.But she is powerless here. Absolutely powerless. In terms of intelligence and ferocity, she is Spacey's equal, and yet she is under a virtual spell in his presence.

I give it three stars for its suspense through most of the plot, which makes it never boring, and for some compelling acting. But through twists that repeatedly undermine the story you thought you were buying into, the film ultimately becomes self-destructive. I've seen it said in various reviews that this movie promotes an anti- death penalty agenda. Well, it sure does seem to much of the way through. But in the end I found myself seriously asking if this film might really be a joke that those reviewers never caught on to. I can really see supporters of capital punishment getting the last laugh here, having a field day in the end, however much they might have been put out with what they perceived along the way as propoganda. After mulling over this movie for a while, I grew to feel a little pride in my never having been a strong zealot one way or another on the capital punishment issue. For the film certainly shows how zealots for a cause can become fanatics who contradict the very principles that attracted them to the cause in the first place. And that amply happens to death penalty opponents in this case. If death penalty advocates want to make a case that opponents are not morally grounded and will sell out their very principles in an effort to promote them, the opponents of the death penalty in this movie have played right into the hands of such criticism. The supposed heroes of this movie think they've won a definitive victory that can't be turned against them. But instead they have done the ultimate in turning of their own cause on its head, and give the other side more ammunition than ever. I'll get no more specific, to avoid spoilers.

And even though it stars liberal actors Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn under the direction of uber-liberal Tim Robbins, that film considers all sides to the issue and doesn't come up with any easy answers.  Definitely check that one out.But THE LIFE OF DAVID GALE, despite some powerhouse actors, is a train wreck of a movie.The plot itself doesn't just concede that the anti-death penalty activists cannot win the debate on their own arguments, it would also have a tough time winning its argument using every lie and manipulation in their bag of tricks...kind of like the Democratic Party right now.With each revelation, usually always in the form of a videocassette hanging in a motel room, you get the idea that the activists would do anything--in fact, the very crime that would call for a death penalty--to get their point across and to impose their beliefs on everyone.  I believe that's called fanaticism.  Ultimately, there are no innocent victims in this story and in some weird way, you end up disliking them for their fraudulent behavior at manipulating a serious issue.Is something worth winning if you have to lie to everyone to get it?This could've been a completely different movie if that had been considered.

I like to see a final fact lending credibility and answers to many questions or holes you had during the viewing. A surprising ending should be such that when you rewind the movie in your mind, bearing the new fact, everything should fall in place.Although the ending of &quot;David Gale&quot; was not totally a surprise - as the viewer could guess his way through, the last facts did render coherence and answered many questions (such as the passivity of Gale's attorney and the connection between the attorney and Dusty). However, what mainly stayed on my mind is the wonder what will Bitsy do with the new information. Was the new information intended to help her clear her guilt for not &quot;making it on time&quot; or will she use this fact in her coverage? probably not, but if so, what will this new fact do to the credibility of the anti death penalty group? Another issue is the great acting ability of David Gale, which should have been an ordinary person, and not another Kevin Spacey. This is something I cannot explain.This is a strong movie in the sense of the powerful moving actors, the intriguing plot and the way the story is told; however, politically speaking and in answer to other viewers, I did not feel the movie did anything to affect my views (which were not very definite to start with) on the issue of death penalty. The movie was unable to give us viewers an innocent face to remember when thinking of the death row and in many ways the anti death penalty people were pictured as fanatics. The very important argument of preserving the sanctity of life, of not taking another person's life was not raised in the movie.It is interesting to see how involved Bitsy becomes during the search for the truth and how she too is exposed. Her crying outside the room after watching the first tape was one of the most moving parts of the movie and a very human reaction she shares with the viewers. The contrast between moments such as this one (or Gale's frustration after his inability to talk to his son), the great sympathy the viewer has towards Gale and Constance and on the other hand the very fanatic radical actions were difficult to reconcile.",4,Interesting to watch in spite of several problems,1082419200,"04 20, 2004",2004,2312,"['enjoy', 'surprising', 'ending', 'when', 'coherence', 'rest', 'movie', 'not', 'when', 'surprise', 'sake', 'surprise', 'like', 'see', 'final', 'fact', 'lending', 'credibility', 'answers', 'many', 'questions', 'holes', 'had', 'viewing', 'surprising', 'ending', 'should', 'be', 'such', 'when', 'rewind', 'movie', 'mind', 'bearing', 'new', 'fact', 'everything', 'should', 'fall', 'ending', 'quot', 'David', 'Gale', 'quot', 'was', 'not', 'totally', 'surprise', 'viewer', 'could', 'guess', 'way', 'last', 'facts', 'did', 'render', 'coherence', 'answered', 'many', 'questions', 'such', 'passivity', 'Gale', 'attorney', 'connection', 'attorney', 'Dusty', 'However', 'what', 'mainly', 'stayed', 'mind', 'wonder', 'what', 'will', 'Bitsy', 'do', 'new', 'information', 'Was', 'new', 'information', 'intended', 'help', 'clear', 'guilt', 'not', 'quot', 'making', 'time', 'quot', 'will', 'use', 'fact', 'coverage', 'probably', 'not', 'so', 'what', 'will', 'new', 'fact', 'do', 'credibility', 'anti', 'death', 'penalty', 'group', 'issue', 'great', 'acting', 'ability', 'David', 'Gale', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'ordinary', 'person', 'not', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'something', 'can', 'not', 'explain.This', 'strong', 'movie', 'sense', 'powerful', 'moving', 'actors', 'intriguing', 'plot', 'way', 'story', 'told', 'however', 'politically', 'speaking', 'answer', 'other', 'viewers', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'movie', 'did', 'anything', 'affect', 'views', 'were', 'not', 'very', 'definite', 'start', 'issue', 'death', 'penalty', 'movie', 'was', 'unable', 'give', 'viewers', 'innocent', 'face', 'remember', 'when', 'thinking', 'death', 'row', 'many', 'ways', 'anti', 'death', 'penalty', 'people', 'were', 'pictured', 'fanatics', 'very', 'important', 'argument', 'preserving', 'sanctity', 'life', 'not', 'taking', 'person', 'life', 'was', 'not', 'raised', 'movie.It', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'involved', 'Bitsy', 'becomes', 'search', 'truth', 'how', 'too', 'exposed', 'crying', 'room', 'watching', 'first', 'tape', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'moving', 'parts', 'movie', 'very', 'human', 'reaction', 'shares', 'viewers', 'contrast', 'moments', 'such', 'one', 'Gale', 'frustration', 'inability', 'talk', 'son', 'great', 'sympathy', 'viewer', 'towards', 'Gale', 'Constance', 'other', 'hand', 'very', 'fanatic', 'radical', 'actions', 'were', 'difficult', 'reconcile']",N/A
610092,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JLZN,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 4]","The film is directed by Alan Parker (British), who picked up this script written by Charles Randolph, formerly professor of philosophy teaching in Vienna.  And titular 'David Gale' is a man waiting for execution in Death Row in, you know, the State of Texas, which sooner or later reminds us of one US President.Yes, using the form of thriller, the film is trying to be provocative, and that is about death penalty.  David Gale, played by Kevin Spacey, is sentenced to death, and now waiting for the time.  He is arrested for raping and murdering Constance (Laura Linney), but the great irony is that he was once known as first-rate professor of philosophy in the academic world, and more importantly, as activist for abolishing capital punishment.Just three days before the execution, David Gale appoints one journalist Elizabeth Bloom (Kate Winslet), and asks to come to meet him, and write a memoir of his life.  David recounts his story, and during the short period the journalist begins to suspect that he is wrongly accused for the murder.The setting is not new; a man (or woman) in Death Row, and someone outside the wall has to prove his/her innocence.  But the originality (if I may call that way) lies in the last chapter of the film, which of course I cannot reveal.  All I can say is that, there is a big surprise (but not exactly a difficult one to guess) -- and the surprise is not a clever one as the film believes it to be.  And moreover, it has a strong social message about the ethics surrounding capital punishment, but this argument looks, to me, a real suspect.  In short, it's off-putting, even pompous.And again I say, the message is about death penality, which needs more careful treatment.  'Dead Man Walking' was tilted to one side, to be sure, but it showed the other side's view, if not quite adequately.  I do not endorse any opinion here, and do not want to.  But 'The Life of David Gale' handles this very hot social issue so carelessly that I could not help thinking that this film is actually damaging the cause it attempts to support.As a thriller, it is not bad; but the incredible ending, and too showy acting (from you know who) just do not help, and if they really think that they (including co-producer Nicholas Cage) can raise a hot debate about this important issue, they are utterly mistaken.",2,I Beg to Disagree:Convoluted Thriller and Too Strong Message,1101686400,"11 29, 2004",2004,2334,"['film', 'directed', 'Alan', 'Parker', 'British', 'who', 'picked', 'up', 'script', 'written', 'Charles', 'Randolph', 'formerly', 'professor', 'philosophy', 'teaching', 'Vienna', 'titular', ""'David"", 'Gale', 'man', 'waiting', 'execution', 'Death', 'Row', 'know', 'State', 'Texas', 'sooner', 'later', 'one', 'US', 'President.Yes', 'using', 'form', 'thriller', 'film', 'trying', 'be', 'provocative', 'death', 'penalty', 'David', 'Gale', 'played', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'sentenced', 'death', 'now', 'waiting', 'time', 'arrested', 'raping', 'murdering', 'Constance', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'great', 'irony', 'was', 'once', 'known', 'first-rate', 'professor', 'philosophy', 'academic', 'world', 'more', 'importantly', 'activist', 'abolishing', 'capital', 'punishment.Just', 'three', 'days', 'execution', 'David', 'Gale', 'one', 'journalist', 'Elizabeth', 'Bloom', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'come', 'meet', 'write', 'memoir', 'life', 'David', 'story', 'short', 'period', 'journalist', 'suspect', 'wrongly', 'accused', 'murder.The', 'setting', 'not', 'new', 'man', 'woman', 'Death', 'Row', 'someone', 'wall', 'prove', 'his/her', 'innocence', 'originality', 'may', 'call', 'way', 'last', 'chapter', 'film', 'course', 'can', 'not', 'reveal', 'can', 'say', 'big', 'surprise', 'not', 'exactly', 'difficult', 'one', 'guess', 'surprise', 'not', 'clever', 'one', 'film', 'be', 'moreover', 'strong', 'social', 'message', 'ethics', 'surrounding', 'capital', 'punishment', 'argument', 'real', 'suspect', 'short', 'off-putting', 'even', 'pompous.And', 'again', 'say', 'message', 'death', 'penality', 'more', 'careful', 'treatment', ""'Dead"", 'Man', 'Walking', 'was', 'tilted', 'one', 'side', 'be', 'sure', 'showed', 'other', 'side', 'view', 'not', 'quite', 'adequately', 'do', 'not', 'endorse', 'opinion', 'here', 'do', 'not', 'want', ""'The"", 'Life', 'David', 'Gale', 'handles', 'very', 'hot', 'social', 'issue', 'so', 'carelessly', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'thinking', 'film', 'actually', 'damaging', 'cause', 'support.As', 'thriller', 'not', 'bad', 'incredible', 'ending', 'too', 'showy', 'acting', 'know', 'who', 'just', 'do', 'not', 'help', 'really', 'think', 'including', 'co-producer', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'can', 'raise', 'hot', 'debate', 'important', 'issue', 'are', 'utterly', 'mistaken']",N/A
610093,AVGGEAI1YGSAP,B00005JLZN,Tucker Andersen,"[8, 19]","This movie apparently has three goals. First, to provide a venue to oppose the death penalty. Second, to provide another offbeat role for Kevin Spacey. Three, to bash Texans in general and George W. Bush (by implication) in particular for their support for the death penalty and the number of executions carried out in the state.Spacey plays David Gale, a former philosophy professor and supposedly outstanding teacher with a first class intellect who is on death row in Texas. Gale grants reporter Bitsey Bloom (Kate Winslet) three interviews with him in the days before his execution. Ironically, he has been convicted of raping and murdering Constance Harraway (Laura Linney), his friend and fellow activist in Death Watch, a group opposing capital punishment. Bloom initially assumes Gale is guilty. However, as the interviews proceed in the three days before the scheduled execution, to the surprise of no one in the audience, she and her assistant Zack Stemmons (Gabriel Mann) uncover evidence that leads them to question the official version of events. The story unfolds in the form of flashbacks during the interviews with Gale, a technique which other reviewers have found distracting but that I felt was quite effective. As the movie unfolds, we learn additional complicating information, such as Harraway was dying of cancer at the time of her death and most importantly that Gale was an alcoholic who had already ruined his career and reputation due to an incident that occurred during a university party.While this story relies on the dual mysteries of how Harraway really died and whether Gale will be executed, there is no mystery at all regarding the motive of the  director - to make a blantantly emotional and political appeal against the death penalty. He uses whatever techniques he can, including sexuality, strong language and reenactments of the crime almost at the level of snuff films. Kevin Spacey's performance is quite good, and as a whole I enjoyed the movie more than AMERICAN BEAUTY (I am sure to be in the minority with that opinion) but not nearly as much as K-PAX. The rest of the characters were pretty unidimensional, although Leon Rippey as Braxton Belyeu, Gale's attorney, and Matt Craven as Dusty Wright, a shadowy figure around the edges of DeathWatch, were well cast for their ambiguous roles. As the movie unfolds and the convoluted details get sorted out, the general shape of the only possible outcome for this impassioned sermon becomes clear, but the exact nature of how the events transpired is kept secret until the end and a few of the details are actually quite clever.If preaching about the immorality of the death penalty or the propaganda of liberal filmamkers will irritate you, don't see this movie. However, I am not a liberal and am not a blanket opponent of the death penalty, although I certainly recognize that it suffers from the problems of all human institutions. As a Kevin Spacey fan, I still found this movie entertaining, but felt that it's cleverness actually made it a less effective witness against the death penalty than the real life stories of people wrongfully convicted of murder and later exonerated and freed, including someone with whom I was personally acquainted. So this film is worthwhile if you are willing to simply watch a film with an interesting story while accepting the idea on which it is based at face value - it is a quite tense action movie. But if you want a great story, wonderful performances, moving screenwriting and a movie likely to inspire multiple viewings, this is defintely not it.",3,An In Your Face Message In Disguise As A Film,1045872000,"02 22, 2003",2003,3585,"['movie', 'apparently', 'three', 'goals', 'First', 'provide', 'venue', 'oppose', 'death', 'penalty', 'Second', 'provide', 'offbeat', 'role', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Three', 'bash', 'Texans', 'general', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'implication', 'particular', 'support', 'death', 'penalty', 'number', 'executions', 'carried', 'out', 'state.Spacey', 'David', 'Gale', 'former', 'philosophy', 'professor', 'supposedly', 'outstanding', 'teacher', 'first', 'class', 'intellect', 'who', 'death', 'row', 'Texas', 'Gale', 'grants', 'reporter', 'Bitsey', 'Bloom', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'three', 'interviews', 'days', 'execution', 'Ironically', 'been', 'convicted', 'raping', 'murdering', 'Constance', 'Harraway', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'friend', 'fellow', 'activist', 'Death', 'Watch', 'group', 'opposing', 'capital', 'punishment', 'Bloom', 'initially', 'Gale', 'guilty', 'However', 'interviews', 'proceed', 'three', 'days', 'scheduled', 'execution', 'surprise', 'one', 'audience', 'assistant', 'Zack', 'Stemmons', 'Gabriel', 'Mann', 'uncover', 'evidence', 'question', 'official', 'version', 'events', 'story', 'unfolds', 'form', 'flashbacks', 'interviews', 'Gale', 'technique', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'found', 'distracting', 'felt', 'was', 'quite', 'effective', 'movie', 'unfolds', 'learn', 'additional', 'complicating', 'information', 'such', 'Harraway', 'was', 'dying', 'cancer', 'time', 'death', 'most', 'importantly', 'Gale', 'was', 'alcoholic', 'who', 'had', 'already', 'ruined', 'career', 'reputation', 'due', 'incident', 'occurred', 'university', 'party.While', 'story', 'dual', 'mysteries', 'how', 'Harraway', 'really', 'died', 'Gale', 'will', 'be', 'executed', 'mystery', 'regarding', 'motive', 'director', 'make', 'blantantly', 'emotional', 'political', 'appeal', 'death', 'penalty', 'techniques', 'can', 'including', 'sexuality', 'strong', 'language', 'reenactments', 'crime', 'almost', 'level', 'snuff', 'films', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'performance', 'quite', 'good', 'whole', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'more', 'AMERICAN', 'BEAUTY', 'am', 'sure', 'be', 'minority', 'opinion', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'K-PAX', 'rest', 'characters', 'were', 'pretty', 'unidimensional', 'Leon', 'Rippey', 'Braxton', 'Belyeu', 'Gale', 'attorney', 'Matt', 'Craven', 'Dusty', 'Wright', 'shadowy', 'figure', 'edges', 'DeathWatch', 'were', 'well', 'cast', 'ambiguous', 'roles', 'movie', 'unfolds', 'convoluted', 'details', 'get', 'sorted', 'out', 'general', 'shape', 'only', 'possible', 'outcome', 'impassioned', 'sermon', 'clear', 'exact', 'nature', 'how', 'events', 'transpired', 'kept', 'secret', 'end', 'few', 'details', 'are', 'actually', 'quite', 'clever.If', 'preaching', 'immorality', 'death', 'penalty', 'propaganda', 'liberal', 'filmamkers', 'will', 'irritate', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'movie', 'However', 'am', 'not', 'liberal', 'am', 'not', 'blanket', 'opponent', 'death', 'penalty', 'certainly', 'recognize', 'problems', 'human', 'institutions', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'fan', 'still', 'found', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'felt', 'cleverness', 'actually', 'made', 'less', 'effective', 'witness', 'death', 'penalty', 'real', 'life', 'stories', 'people', 'wrongfully', 'convicted', 'murder', 'later', 'exonerated', 'freed', 'including', 'someone', 'whom', 'was', 'personally', 'acquainted', 'So', 'film', 'worthwhile', 'are', 'willing', 'simply', 'watch', 'film', 'interesting', 'story', 'accepting', 'idea', 'based', 'face', 'value', 'quite', 'tense', 'action', 'movie', 'want', 'great', 'story', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'moving', 'screenwriting', 'movie', 'likely', 'inspire', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'defintely', 'not']",N/A
