Which is exactly the opposite of the hit 80's TV show. I was a huge fan of the series and this movie has two things going for it.1- The Genaral Lee. I dont know what it is about seeing this car fly 60 feet in the air, but I could watch it all day!!! Its the coolest car ever, and clearly the star of the film. There are some of the best car jumps EVER in this movie.2- Jessica Simpson. Im not a huge fan of hers, but she does a decent acting job. And I cannot state enough that if you are a man she will make your jaw drop. WOW. She is in very good shape!!!The bad parts of the film are pretty much everything else. It is badly mis-cast. I love Burt Reynolds movies, but he is a horrible Boss Hog. Knoxville and Scott are NOT the Duke boys. I refuse to see them that way. And when did Uncle Jesse start smoking weed???

943808,A1IKOYZVFHO1XP,B000BKJ74Y,andy8047,"[2, 4]","Twenty-six years ago,this comedy adventure premiered on CBS-TV. Reruns are currently seen on CMT(Country Music Television). Two decades ago,the show got the Nielsen axe along with The Jeffersons and Alice. Johnny Knoxville and Seann William Scott are cousins Luke and Bo Duke,portrayed respectively by Tom Wopat and John Schneider on the CBS series. However,SWS sports a beard. Despite their characters,Knoxville looks nothing like Wopat and SWS looks nothing like Schneider. Singing sensation Jessica Simpson is Daisy Duke,another cousin of Luke's and Bo's. Daisy is a blonde unlike her brunette TV counterpart,Catherine Bach. Bach is still a sexy beauty at age 51. Daisy is a waitress at the Boar's Nest,a pub and short order restaurant owned by Hazzard County Commissioner Jefferson Davis ""Boss"" Hogg(Oscar winner Burt Reynolds). Unlike the late Sorrell Booke who was Hogg on the series,Reynolds kept his trademark moustache(he sported a shorn goatee until later in the film). Another legendary entertainer is country star Willie Nelson who is Uncle Jesse,portrayed by the late Denver Pyle on the series. Deputy Enos Strate,service station attendant Cooter Davenport and Hazzard County sheriff Roscoe Coltrane were portrayed by either previously unknown or little-known actors,respectively. Memorable scenes include Luke and Bo hanging out at a girls' college,their impersonating foreign scientists and of course,their going out of their way,along with Daisy,to prevent construction of a new structure on the Dukes' farmland,which they almost lost. Only Boss and Roscoe were in favor of the construction. Also,take notice of Roscoe's basset hound Flash,who was much larger than the one seen on the series(from 1980 to the cancellation). I know the TV Flash was a female,but I don't know for sure about the film Flash. Because the series ended its run in 1985,the TV Flash has since died. And she debuted on the series five years earlier. During the end credits,Nelson performs GOOD OL' BOYS written by the late Waylon Jennings. Jennings performed the song in the opening montages of every episode in the series. In fact,Nelson and Jennings were longtime friends. They had a hit in 1978,MAMMAS,DON'T LET YOU BABIES GROW UP TO BE COWBOYS which they recorded as Waylon & Willie. Also,get a load of Bo's reckless driving of the General Lee. I don't know what kind of car was unsed in the film,but I know a 1969 Dodge Charger was used on the series. One song from this soundtrack is Simpson performing THESE BOOTS WERE MADE FOR WALKIN',which was a hit in 1966 for Nancy Sinatra(daughter of the late Frank). And of course,we see in the film,Luke and Bo racing the General Lee in a derby. None of the series' cast appeared in the film,but some,if not all(the survivors) have met the film's stars. Booke died in 1994 of a massive heart attack and Pyle died on Christmas Day 1997,his 77th birthday,of lung cancer. So I dedicate this film to their memories. This is one of few films that Reynolds did without(top)star billing.

943813,A36JO8IHKYBMMJ,B000BKJ74Y,Bart Motes,"[2, 5]","I'm not a fan of the old show, but enough of it floated through the cultural ether for me to get the general jist: two wily Southern boys with a outlaw mentality outwit the local corrupt establishment in a cool car. The movie is only vaguely related to that concept. Here, two guys with Southern accents as consistent as a flickering bulb bumble around doing mildly illegal stuff and are once again set against a corrupt local establishment. They are no longer smooth characters, they are, as another reviewer noted, kinda dumb (as Seann Williams notes in the outtakes when his cousin shares a pretty intense liplock with the girl he has secretly been shagging supposedly behind the back of smitten Williams's character--Oh, I'm a moron!), and rescued from the consequences of all their actions by deux ex machina.A particularly awkward set of scenes is where they take heat for the politically incorrect Southern battle flag on the roof of the General Lee. If the filmmakers wanted to take on the split cultural significances of the Stars and Bars, they should not simply played them for cheap laughs.But cheap laughs are the best part of this movie. And on that basis, I was well amused. I'm not surprised to learn that the director of the gutbusting (and far superior) Supertroopers was involved here. At its best, Dukes of Hazzard has that devil may care absurdist glee about it. It would have been a lot better if they had gone the whole hog and taken a really meta-revisionist axe to the project, making Williams and Knoxville latter day romantics about the legendary Dukes. For one thing, then we'd be spared the accents.So, on the one hand, this is the worst kind of shallow strip mining of cultural artifacts. On the other, its an entertaining romp with a likeable cast and a deft comedic hand at the stern. If in doubt, catch it on cable. I doubt I'll ever watch it again, but I don't regret the time spent with it either.Update: I'm a little confused as to why there are so many negative votes on my review.

943815,A1NSMQIF1C2VCE,B000BKJ74Y,Beau Yarbrough,"[3, 4]","The good news and the bad news: The Dukes of Hazzard movie is extremely similar to the television series it's based upon. No one ever gets hurt through all the stunts and cartoon violence, running moonshine comes off as a harmless bit of fun and most of the movie is watching amazing car stunts and ogling Daisy Duke.It could have been a lot different: Johnny Knoxville could potentially have brought a gritty vibe, and Seann William Scott could have brought a real gross-out appeal, but except for momentary nods in that direction, the show stays mostly true to its roots.Changing the tone more than the two leads is Willie Nelson as Uncle Jesse. In a nod to real life, Jesse sneaks in a little marijuana smoking (hinted at, more than shown in the rated version, explicitly shown in the unrated version) and brings a love of silly jokes to the proceedings -- the ad-libbed scenes of Willie Nelson telling Johnny Knoxville one silly joke after another, as he lobs flaming jars of moonshine behind the car is one of the highlights of the movie.Jessica Simpson does very little in this film, but it's exactly what you'd expect and, to be fair, she does it very well. Daisy remains sexy-but-not-slutty, just as she was in Catherine Bach's original version of the character. The 2005 rendition just is a hard-bodied version showing even more skin.In a nice update, the General Lee doesn't start off with the Confederate Battle Flag on the roof of the car, and once it appears, Bo and Luke are ambivalent about it being there (and it appears to be gone in the final sequence where the car is hidden in a field), and they get an earful about it while on the highway into Atlanta, both positive and negative.Burt Reynolds, whose Smokey and the Bandit movies are almost certainly responsible for the creation of the original TV show, is mostly wasted here, showing little of the oily charm he's been able to show even in lesser movies, like Striptease. Still, the Bandit turning Boss Hogg is worth a look, and a definite shout-out to the fans who've been watching this mini-genre of movies and television shows since the 1970s.A recommended viewing for fans of the original show or Smokey and the Bandit.

The Amtrak Autotrain rents movie players that include a number of great films (Good Night and Good Luck, The Corpse Bride, Gone With The Wind) and then there is The Dukes of Hazzard. Let's put it this way, my 12 year old son loved this movie. It was edited for content, which put it just above G. But the plot wasn't edited, unfortunately. Cousins Luke and Bo Duke, just a couple of moonshine delivery boys (I bet you didn't know that was how NASCAR started, did you?), driving a 7 MPG 1968 Dodge Charger discover that the reason the local political boss is trying to get all the farms in Hazzard county is to strip mine for coal. This leads to all kinds of hijinks, such as blowing up a safe, being chased by every law enforcement agency in Georgia, kidnapping an Australian college student and causing more damage than Hurricane Katrina.

943820,AXKLJRDTPJCA7,B000BKJ74Y,Boss Fan,"[0, 2]","It is somewhat ironic that Amazon lists this item as a buyable companion to ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith."" While the two film's premises couldn't be more different, and if you only saw the trailers it is understandable to assume they play to completely different audiences (for instance, my parents would probably never rush out to see ""Dukes,"" but given the plot and star power of ""Smith"" they made it a point to check that one out on opening weekend).Yet as I was watching ""Dukes"" and as I was compiling my thoughts to post here, I kept wanting to compare the two; making easy sumations like, 'just like Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" ""Dukes of Hazzard"" is a typical, and typically dumb movie that somehow, in spite of itself, manages to be undeniably entertaining. In my ""Smith"" review I mentioned how unbelievably dumb the script was, combining lazy writing and plot holes you could drive a mack truck through, but the two leads were so charasmatic and the movie exploited every possible contrivence of its oulandish scenario to its maximum potential, that the movie was somewhat irresistable anyway.But if ""Smith"" was dumb and improbable on a great level, then ""Dukes of Hazzard"" has found a way to take that concept to a whole new level. Not only is the plot oulandish and improbable, it is also rahter nonexistant; an excuse to stage big chase scenes combined with typical fratboy humor. Like a lot of movies, you have seen this film before, only this time it is set in Hazzard County instead of on a college campus (although the film does make a brief detour to one)or some other genre clieche local. It's the same old thing, Mr. Big type (here its Boss Hog) will make a ton of money but will destroy the town in doing so. So it's up to the dimwitted leads to save the day. I'm not sure the Dukes actually do anything that helps matters all that much (they pretty much destroy everything they touch and land in holding cells through most of the movie), but I guess them looking busy doing something makes us think their actions are helpful.At least they are proactive.And the comedy is pretty thin, when you laugh you almost feel guilty for doing so because all the jokes and gags are either recycled, lazy or childish - often all at the same time. And yet, you will laugh. Why? As with the Smiths, the credit goes to the formidable cast. Hearing jokes as simple and comonly known as, 'why are divorces so expensive? Because they're worth it,' would be pretty lame if just tossed around in a movie to call it a comedy. But when Willie Nelson drops them his dry, good-ol-boy delivery, while chucking molitoff cocktails at cop cars, its pretty damn funny (of his joke, by the way, that is the only one I dare repeat in this forum).  The Dukes themselves are basically required to yell things like 'yee-haw!"" and 'whoa,'  the later so much so they give Keanue Reeves a run for his money.  I wouldn't recomend creating a drinking game where the everyone drinks everytime said references pop up (because 10 minutes you'd end up with alcohol poisoning), but you certainly could.  But eveen though they don't get to flex their actor muscles much, the movie doesn't really require them too.  As long as they make for likeable and sympathetic troublemakers, they succeed at all the parts require.  Ditto Jessica Simpson and Burt Reynolds.  Not great performances, but adequate and often surprisingly better than you'd expect - if you're expectations are low.And that goes for the film itself.  My expectations could'nt have been any lower.  The reviews were lousy, I was not a fan of the TV series (I never much watched it because I never much liked it - of course, I was pretty young then, but TV Land reruns have not changed mind to this day), and I have no big fanfare in me for anyone in the cast.  I can see how die hard fans of the tv series would be disapointed; that is bound to happen with any remake of a favorite and if you thought the PG-13 version took things too far in comparison to the TV show then you'll want to avoid the Unrated version at all costs.But speaking as an outsider, as a typical dumb guys, hot girls, raunchy, car-chase comedy, ""Dukes"" works as well as any of its type.  As I said, credit the likeable cast, but I think director Jay Chandrasekhar deserves the bulk of the kudos.  The Broken Lizard comedy troupe vet, who gave as the similarly-toned ""Super Troopers"" works the same comedy magic here.  I have not seen the PG-13 version of this film, but I'd wager I would not have found it as funny.  Most of the laughs here come from that Broken Lizard style of comedy.  Low-brow, quick witted insults and gags involving drugs sex and car crashes.  Nothing in this movie falls into the quick witted category, but if it lacks that aspect of, say, ""Super Troopers"" it makes up for it with plenty more action and car chase sequences, all of them staged rather well from a comedy director.  The movie is essentialy one long car chase.  Best of all, some Broken Lizard vets pop up in funny suporting roles.  Without them to add to the comedy, just having the Dukes do their rather repetative thing, the movie may have grown stale and tired.So it's no comedy classic and at 107 minutes it feels too long.  But even though there is nothing special here, there are plenty of laughs and a suprisingly better/funnier movie than people like myself, who are not fans of the show, the cast and listened to reviews, could have predicted.  Thanks largely to great direction and likeable performaces,  overall, ""Dukes of Hazard"" is a dumb, but pleasant surprise.",3,"DUMB DUKES!

Butler,"[1, 2]","I'll always defend the theatrical version of this film.But I can't at all defend this new Unrated Version.I didn't quite understand Ben Jones' anger when the film was released, especially his plea to fans to not see it until ""it's cleaned up"" to make it more like the ""wholesome"" original series (especially since the Pilot episode had inferences that Bo and Luke fathered some of the illegitimate children at the Hazzard County Orphanage).I went in with an open mind and enjoyed it immensely. The audience I was with enjoyed it just as much, and it's not often I see a film where I laugh as often as I did. Willie Nelson, for instance, practically steals every scene he's in, and his jokes had me howling.Is the film the same as the original series? No.....it's not meant to be. It's an entirely new interpretation, and I was able to overlook all the PG-13 language and sexual INNUENDOES.That having been said, I don't at all like what they've done with the Unrated Version. If this was the script Ben Jones was talking about, he was dead-on.  Plus, some scenes in the theatrical version actually worked better than those that replaced them (the final scene with Willie Nelson and Lynda Carter, for instance).While I'm not at all opposed to seeing FEMALE NUDITY, which this film has, I am opposed to seeing it, as well as anything more than innuendoes, sexual, drug use or otherwise, in any interpretation of the ""Dukes."" The deleted scenes even include Bo and Luke with marijuana, in a clear-cut scene not even open to interpretation.I was raised on the ""Dukes of Hazzard"" and always associate the show with my childhood. Too bad modern-day children won't be able to watch this Unrated Film.I can tolerate PG-13 material in a ""Dukes"" movie, but nothing beyond that.Please release the theatrical version in widescreen.

If you can't do that, you'll never be satisfied with ANY remake of the Dukes. Why? Well, read on...1) Very simply, the old cast is GONE. And if they were resurrected - as in a 25 yrs later Dukes - we'd have graying Bo & Luke, no Uncle Jesse or Boss Hogg, an overweight Daisy, etc etc. So the plot lines would have to be radically different.2) So, to keep the plot line what it was, there had to be a new cast. And absolutely no new cast of actors can capture the ""exact"" magic and chemistry of that original cast, no matter how the producers and directors finagle it.In other words, people who went to see the movie expecting the exact same show, exact same characters, and the old circa 1980 setting, were doomed to disappointment (and after all - what would be the point of a movie remake that's exactly what the show was??)...This is an entirely new Dukes of Hazzard, set in 21st century, and you must take it as such. ""Jessica Simpson is lousy - not even a southern accent!"" you say? Well, Catherine Bach (something of a TV icon; and well deserved) also had NO southern accent - in fact, hers is almost exactly like Jessica's! And both made wonderful Daisy's for their time.Uncle Jesse, played by Willie Nelson, sure ain't Denver Pyle's Jesse. But think about it - who else could've done better?

On the original show, I seem to recall that bad guys were the dumb ones and the good guys mostly did not act like morons. Here, the situation is reversed. All the while, the South is portrayed as the irretrievably backward place that it is not (which was pretty silly in the 1980s when the show was on, and it is even sillier now). The ""Dukes of Hazzard"" plays more like an episode of Knoxville's ""Jackass"" than the old TV show.

943835,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000BKJ74Y,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[5, 8]","The Dukes of Hazzard truly earns a place in the hall of shame of terrible, ill-advised remakes of previously popular TV shows.  Maybe, if you've never seen the show, you might think the movie is OK; the rest of us can only sit and cringe while Hollywood basically makes a mockery out of everything the show was about.  The script is bad in and of itself, but the casting is a total disaster.  I don't mind Johnny Knoxville and Seann William Scott so much, but Jessica Simpson is no Daisy, Burt Reynolds is almost the antithesis of the real Boss Hogg, Willie Nelson turns Uncle Jessie into some coarse country comedian you can't begin to respect, and Roscoe - what the heck happened to the Roscoe character?  James Best was one of the real stars of the television show; he made most of the comedy happen, and most kids included a Roscoe P. Coltrane impression in their comedic repertoire.  I've never even heard of M.C. Gainey, but he could never even begin to fill Best's shoes, even if the script had actually given us a character remotely similar to the original.  Maybe Burt Reynolds wanted to hog all of the bad guy spotlight; I can't think of any other reason why the Roscoe character would be treated with such contempt and neglect by the filmmakers.  And why is Lynda Carter even in the movie?Calling this modern Bo and Luke good old boys is stretching the point a bit; these guys actually should be in jail for all of their shenanigans.  Heck, the costs of all the property damage they inflict on Hazzard (not to mention Atlanta - which brings up another point: I'm almost sure the TV show was set in North Carolina and not Georgia) should be enough to bankrupt the county.  There's really nothing good about either one of them, especially in terms of their treatment of women.  It's safe to say that this film won't be found among Gloria Steinem's list of favorites.  As a Southerner, I'm not too happy with it, either, as the film went out of its way several times to basically ridicule Southern culture.  Then there's the fact that the Duke boys (and even Uncle Jessie) like to smoke something stronger than cigarettes.  Denver Pyle must still be spinning in his grave.  What's next?  An Andy Griffith remake featuring a drug-dealing Opie?The main problem with this film is the fact that it was primarily built around the General Lee and all the amazing jumps the studio guys dreamed of cramming together in one film.  They even messed even that up, unfortunately.  The jumps on the old TV show always looked real, but the jumps in the film are too high and too far to look like anything other than Hollywood stunts and special effects.  The only two things addressed in the DVD's extras of behind-the-scenes footage are the General Lee and Jessica Simpson's shorts.  Now I like watching Simpson gallivanting around in short shorts as much as the next guy, but I need a little more from a movie - something like a decent script, for example.There are plenty of reasons why loyal fans of the show as well as Ben Jones, the original Cooter and former U.S. Congressman, basically boycotted the film.

I saw very little to refute that evaluation. As a non-fan of the TV show, I only went to the movie because a friend worked on the crew and I hoped to see his name in the credits. Ho hum, it wasn't there, but several Louisiana settings were, including the Baton Rouge building in which I work. The ""star"" of the show is an orange late model Dodge Charger with a rebel flag painted on top, known affectionately to owner Bo Duke and cousins Luke and Daisy Duke, as the ""General Lee."" Bo and Luke spend most of the time riding around in the General delivering moonshine for ""Uncle Jessie"" (a waste of Willie Nelson's talent), and later in a race (what else) and on a mission to save Hazzard County (what else, part 2).Other than the shots of home turf and a decent Southern rock soundtrack, the two ""boys"" ""highlight"" the show. Bo, played by a scruffy young actor named Scott, has a well-developed love affair with ""the General"" and kind of a goofy charm about him. Luke, played by Johnny Knoxville (the name sounds like a country version of those movie stars on the Beverly Hillbillies--Dash Riprock and the like), is a little too old to be called a ""boy"", except in the Southern ""good old boy"" sense, but he's handy with a blow torch. Also to his credit, he's been smart enough not to sign up with the Hazzard County police department, who make the rest of the cast look like Nobel laureates.Besides Willie, other big-name stars are Jessica Simpson, who displays little talent aside from what can be seen sticking out of short shorts, low cut blouses, and a bikini; and Burt Reynolds, who plays against type in this kind of movie (see Smokey and the Bandit) as the scheming, white-clad Boss Hogg.Teenagers and grown fans of the original show probably won't be disappointed, if my daughter and stepson are evidence. There's cartoon violence, a little bad language, some talk about sex (including, surprisingly, sex with cars) and some implied drug use, but what even an 8-year old remembers will certainly be all the car crashes and jumps.Having no expectations, I wasn't disappointed (except for not seeing my friend's name), but I'd prefer that the movie business's resources be used on better projects that this one.",1,A Real Bag of Hammers,1162252800,"10 31, 2006",2006,2339,"['One', 'reviewer', 'described', 'new', 'movie', 'version', 'TV', 'classic', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', 'dumber', 'bag', 'hammers', 'saw', 'very', 'little', 'refute', 'evaluation', 'non-fan', 'TV', 'show', 'only', 'went', 'movie', 'friend', 'worked', 'crew', 'hoped', 'see', 'name', 'credits', 'Ho', 'hum', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'several', 'Louisiana', 'settings', 'were', 'including', 'Baton', 'Rouge', 'building', 'work', 'star', 'show', 'orange', 'late', 'model', 'Dodge', 'Charger', 'rebel', 'flag', 'painted', 'top', 'known', 'affectionately', 'owner', 'Bo', 'Duke', 'cousins', 'Luke', 'Daisy', 'Duke', 'General', 'Lee', 'Bo', 'Luke', 'spend', 'most', 'time', 'riding', 'around', 'General', 'delivering', 'moonshine', 'Uncle', 'Jessie', 'waste', 'Willie', 'Nelson', 'talent', 'later', 'race', 'what', 'else', 'mission', 'save', 'Hazzard', 'County', 'what', 'else', 'part', '2', '.Other', 'shots', 'home', 'turf', 'decent', 'Southern', 'rock', 'soundtrack', 'two', 'boys', 'highlight', 'show', 'Bo', 'played', 'scruffy', 'young', 'actor', 'named', 'Scott', 'well-developed', 'love', 'affair', 'General', 'kind', 'goofy', 'charm', 'Luke', 'played', 'Johnny', 'Knoxville', 'name', 'country', 'version', 'movie', 'stars', 'Beverly', 'Hillbillies', 'Dash', 'Riprock', 'like', 'little', 'too', 'old', 'be', 'called', 'boy', 'Southern', 'good', 'old', 'boy', 'sense', 'handy', 'blow', 'torch', 'Also', 'credit', 'been', 'smart', 'enough', 'not', 'sign', 'up', 'Hazzard', 'County', 'police', 'department', 'who', 'make', 'rest', 'cast', 'look', 'Nobel', 'laureates.Besides', 'Willie', 'other', 'big-name', 'stars', 'are', 'Jessica', 'Simpson', 'who', 'little', 'talent', 'aside', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'sticking', 'short', 'shorts', 'low', 'cut', 'blouses', 'bikini', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'who', 'type', 'kind', 'movie', 'see', 'Smokey', 'Bandit', 'scheming', 'white-clad', 'Boss', 'Hogg.Teenagers', 'grown', 'fans', 'original', 'show', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'daughter', 'stepson', 'are', 'evidence', 'cartoon', 'violence', 'little', 'bad', 'language', 'talk', 'sex', 'including', 'surprisingly', 'sex', 'cars', 'implied', 'drug', 'use', 'what', 'even', '8-year', 'old', 'remembers', 'will', 'certainly', 'be', 'car', 'crashes', 'jumps.Having', 'expectations', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'not', 'seeing', 'friend', 'name', ""'d"", 'prefer', 'movie', 'business', 'resources', 'be', 'used', 'better', 'projects', 'one']",N/A

These days, I'm a bit reluctant to admit this fact as it was a pretty campy show.  But, it was fun & and I even remember my ""cultured"" father liking the show.  Here is yet another remake of a 70s / 80s TV show, made into a movie 20+ years later.The casting for the movie is decent with Seann William Scott as a natural for playing the cantankerous Bo Duke.  I found Johnny Knoxville a bit bland as Luke Duke - a definite downgrade from Tom Wopat.  Jessica Simpson fills in nicely as Daisy Duke, although I doubt if she's ever going to get any roles that are much different than this one.  It would have been a nice touch had they had a cameo or two of the actors from the original series.  If there were any cameos, I didn't see them.As you may have guessed, the plot is pretty contrived, but for a movie like this it works.  The Duke boys even take a road-trip to Atlanta, which is something that never happened in the series.  The original series was always filmed on back-roads in Hicksville.For those of you who might be curious about the unrated label, it's the road trip to Atlanta where it comes in.  I'm assuming that unlike the PG-13 theatrical release, this one shows numerous college coeds frolicking about topless.  I certainly had no problem with that particular element (notably absent from the TV series!).The biggest thing that they got right with this film was the GENERAL LEE.  Without question, it was the ""star"" of both the TV series and the movie.  It made the '69 Charger muscle car famous, and the film is not short on various ways to demonstrate the car's prowess.If you liked the original TV series, this movie is probably worth a look.

Oddly enough, I thought Johnny Knoxville was interesting and they did play parts of my favorite AC/DC song (what is an AC/DC song doing in a movie like this?!?).  I also like breastesses.  Seann Wm Scott is from the K.Costner school of acting.  He plays the same character (Stiffler) in every role.  The movie barely resembles the series in any way, except for the car.  Ogling J. Simpson is fun but watching her act hurts.  To think that after enduring this we watched ""The Island"".  Sad.  Many good brain cells were killed that night.  Thank God for alcohol.  A true twin bill of terror.As the parent of an 8 year old who has ""discovered"" the original series, I was appalled.  Let's face it - there are plenty of crappy movies to go around.

943848,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000BKJ74Y,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 4]","Unfortunately, the current Hollywood big studio practice of remaking TV series of yore into big-budget feature films has reached yet another nadir with this 2005 overblown cartoon of a movie. I should, however, give the movie credit for being perfectly clear on what it is, my backhanded way of saying some movies are deceptively marketed only to disappoint expectations (key example - the dismal update of ""Bewitched""). This movie is what it is and nothing more. The source material was certainly not substantive, as the early-eighties series inspired by the movie was simply about two good ol' boy cousins named Bo and Luke Duke, who went on high-speed chases in their souped-up Charger named the General Lee. They were surrounded by stock characters like the nefarious Boss Hogg and aided by their moonshine-concocting Uncle Jesse and their shapely cousin Daisy in cutaway jean shorts.Despite the inane, derivative nature of its premise, there was some semblance of sincerity in the TV show that has been jettisoned here in favor of cynical bombast and teenage-oriented raunch. There is some hint of a plot involving Bo and Luke's plan to repair the General Lee and win the big road rally in time to stop Hogg's scheme to strip mine Hazzard County. However, nothing has been developed much beyond the premise. Casting poses a problem as well.  As the cousins, Johnny Knoxville and Seann William Scott are not very convincing as good-natured rednecks, as they seem more like MTV party-animal personalities masquerading as Southerners. Jessica Simpson is certainly an eyeful as Daisy, especially in a hot pink bikini, but she is hopelessly stilted when she is called on to say anything. It also seems a shame to waste Willie Nelson rather apathetic as Jesse save for his series of rim-shot redneck jokes, though the most embarrassing moments clearly belong to Burt Reynolds looking surgically altered and somewhat anesthetized as Hogg.Director Jay Chandrasekhar and screenwriter John O'Brien don't seem to have an ironic sense of the absurdity of the story (like director McG showed to some degree with the first big-screen update of ""Charlie's Angels"") and miss an opportunity for satire by simply poking fun at Hollywood-based Southern stereotypes. Even a genial ribbing of the TV series could have helped here, but it's obvious the studio executives prevailed as the tepid, by-the-numbers result confirms. Luckily for fans of this genre, there is an abundance of technically impressive, emotionally vacuous car chases. There are loads of bloopers and deleted scenes with the DVD package, some designed to be titillating with the ""unrated"" label, but the silliest extra may be ""Daisy Dukes: The Short Short Shorts"", which has the film's costume designers explaining how they made the (in)famous jean shorts.

HAMILTON "".: Just Folks""","[5, 9]","I'll start this review off with a few words of commentary; anElswetorial, if you will.Ben Jones commenced a great bruja-ja here in (semi-)local Knoxvillewhen he was present for the unveiling of this cinematic work. It seemsthat Mr. Jones (and while he spoke for some of the other ""original""cast members, I never quite believed he was authorized to do that)believes that he should have been offered a cameo in this work. Sincehe wasn't, he has set about extolling the horrors of this modernizedupdate of the beloved (?!) family series.Okay, I'll accept that some people did LOVE this series. But the Dukesof Hazard always was a bit racey for some. Bo and Luke ran moonshinefrom their Uncle Jessie's still, Daisy was a little short on thewardrobe department, and Uncle Jessie was the leader of this motleyhillbilly moonshine gang that any ""Revenuer"" worth his badge would haveloved to have thrown in jail. The ""boys"" stayed in a constant state oftrouble, and flaunted their illegal activities in the face of local lawenforcement. These were NOT ""good"" boys!No, there was no marijuana use in the television series. It wasTELEVISION! They couldn't do that and be on television as a series.Frankly, I never loved the series. I thought it was hokey,unintelligent, and downright stupid. It made Southerners look like weARE inbred idiots. I detested it.As far as this modernization goes, I found it to be a 100% improvementover the cheesy dialog and horrible acting perpetrated upon us by theseries! The performances were great, the plot was in keeping with theoriginal series, the action...wow the action!This movie was a stunt-driver's wet dream! It was reminiscent (if onlya small bit) of Smokey and the Bandit in that it was great fun towatch. And while I enjoyed Jessica Simpson's Daisy Duke far more than Ithought was possible, she would have made a better Ellie Mae Clampett,in my opinion.It wasn't afraid to laugh at itself and never took itself tooseriously. Unfortunately, Burt Reynolds was a very weak Boss Hogg. Ihave no idea what they were thinking. The casting choice wasn'tnecessarily a bad call, but the direction of his character was justflaccid, as was Burt's performance. He played him too unemotionalwithout ever coming close to hitting the level of calculated treacherySorrel Brooke's Boss Hogg exuded. I felt that Mr. Reynolds wasjust...horrible in this endeavor, but Willie Nelson more than made upfor that in his portrayal as Uncle Jessie.So don't listen to the nay-sayers. This is a highly entertainingendevor. Even those of us of the ""alternative"" categorization could(and did) experience a few honest belly-laughs at our own expense.Heck, we survived ""Deliverance!""

943856,A1I8F97AHES8YD,B000BKJ74Y,George Graham,"[3, 6]","Okay, first things first: the critics who bashed this movie obviously didn't like the show, because, take away a few cuss words and a bit more risque scenes, this is how the show is. So if you liked the show, you'll like the movie.I like the show. It's mindless fun with an awesome theme song and one of the coolest cars (and horns) around. The story for newbies: Luke (Johnny Knoxville) and Bo (Seann William Scott) Duke are two wild cousins in Hazzard County, Georgia who deliver moonshine in their famous General Lee vehicle for their Uncle Jesse (Willie Nelson). The sheriff in town, Roscoe, and his dimwitted deputy Enos, are paid by Boss Hogg (Burt Reynolds) to do his bidding (so basically, Boss Hogg runs Hazzard). Problems are caused when the Dukes' moonshine business is shut down, and the Dukes find out that Boss Hogg's planning to stripmine Hazzard. Oh, did I mention Luke & Bo's other cousin Daisy (Jessica Simpson), who gets the two out of tight spots with her, ahem, assets?Director Jay Chandrasekhar (part of the Broken Lizard comedy troop that did Super Troopers & Club Dread) does a great job translating the show to the big screen. The plot could have been one on the show, and everything you loved (the General Lee, all the characters, car chases, Daisy in revealing outfits, the hood slide, the theme song) is here. All the Lizards get cameos (one of them, with Chandrasekhar and Erik Stolhanske as cops on a college campus that echo their characters in Super Troopers, is a bit lame), the best of which Kevin Heffernan as Sheev, the dimwitted local who helps the boys and specializes in safecracking and making armadillo helmets.The casting is great: Knoxville & Scott are a fine Luke and Bo(although Luke now seems to be the ladies man, but Bo was in the show), Simpson was practically born to play Daisy, ditto for Nelson (who even sings the theme song at the end), David Koechner (aka Champ in Anchorman) is a great Cooter, Reynolds a perfectly sleazy Boss Hogg, and...well, whoever play Roscoe & Enos (I know that the guy who plays Roscoe was in Club Dread) do their jobs well.

You love ""The Dukes of Hazzard"". You love Daisy Duke, The General Lee, moonshine, Uncle Jesse, and you think the Waylon Jennings theme song is just about the best damn song ever written. You can name the character cousins who replaced Bo and Luke Duke during their brief contract dispute with CBS, (the question stumped me during a recent Trivial Pursuit bout). You said a silent prayer when you heard two of the series stunt drivers were killed during a filming of one of the episodes, ending with, 'that great dirt back road in the sky'. You owned a Dukes of Hazzard T-shirt, the board game, official '69 Charger model kit, and you periodically check the secondary market of your Dukes of Hazzard lunch box.This movie loves the Dukes too. The cameras treat The General, that legendary orange '69 Charger, like a star in a fashion shoot, with long, loving, slow-motion shots and spectacular flying sequences, not only over country creeks, but highflying like a witch on a broom over highways in downtown Atlanta. Yee-Haw! There's more love here than a possum in springtime. A minor beloved character smiles directly into the camera after his bit, and who would have imagined that Daisy Duke's short shorts could become shorter? I can reluctantly admit that all essential characters, and then some, are accounted for, and the script is taken directly from episodes of the series, particularly the one about the successful hometown Hazzard boy who comes home to win the big race.The movie Dukes are a little dumber than TV's clean-cut Bo and Luke. Seann William Scott, as Bo, conveys a perfect simple-minded, big-hearted, gearhead country bumpkin, and Johnny Knoxville, aside from some lame and gratuitous stunt work, manages to fulfill the character, even with a wavering put-upon southern accent. The funniest role belongs to Kevin Hefferman as conspiracy minded, schizophrenic good ole boy, Sheev, who wears an armadillo shell on his head to block secret messages from the CIA. Jessica Simpson, as the leggy Daisy Duke, admits in the DVD extras that she only has to stand around and look good, and she does that well enough. The only grave disappointment is law enforcement bungling baddies, Roscoe and Boss Hogg, characters demanding broad slapstick are given careless and indifferent no-cigar treatment.So kick your shoes off, set down ahwile, the DVD extras reveal a dismantled and controlled General Lee, but dreams of a '69 Charger never die.

943859,A1LW3XGXYP98BW,B000BKJ74Y,H. Pace,"[1, 2]","I'll start out by saying I'm not a purist.  But if you're going to take something as ain't-broken as the Dukes of Hazzard, you daggum well better know what you're doing when you try to fix it.  This movie has a lot of changes.  Some work well and some don't, but the end product isn't nearly as good as the source material.  It is a lot of fun if you don't think too hard about it.Any Dukes of Hazzard film is going to live or die by its car chases and especially the jumps.  Through most of the film they do not disappoint.  The jump onto the highway in Atlanta is one of the greatest jumps I've ever seen on the screen.  They just about ruin it all, though, with the last jump, a CGI atrocity.  When will filmmakers learn that just because it can be done in CGI doesn't mean it won't look like trash?  From the DVD extras, they actually did the real jump (with dummies), then ruined it with CGI.  And they planned to do the same with the rest of the jumps, but those looked so great even their own foolishness wouldn't let them ruin them.  A lot of the other car stunts are truly special.The filmmakers made some strange choices in adaptation.  The Dukes and their allies replace Boss Hogg and Roscoe P. Coltrane as the comic foils, but neither Hogg nor Roscoe (M.C. Gainey isn't half as scary as he was in Justified) can manage to be terribly menacing.  The movie (especially the unrated version) is also quite risqu&eacute;.  I have no philosophical disagreement with that, but let's be honest--the Dukes don't need to go lowest common denominator to entertain.  I guess the thinking was that the old Dukes fans have all grown up, but the old Dukes formula would always be beloved by kids (and those of us that still like to pretend we're kids from time to time).Jessica Simpson tries hard, and fails, to look as good as Catherine Bach, but I'm not complaining.  Willie Nelson as Uncle Jesse just fires off one-liners.  The soundtrack is mostly southern rock mainstays, and it's a downright joy for country boy's when the General Lee fires up and Black Betty cranks up.Broken Lizard (of Super Troopers fame) eventually took over production.  They left many a hat tip to their marquee production.  Governor Jessman (Lynda Carter), the fast food cashier, and the Vermont state troopers from Super Troopers all make appearances.  There is also an allusion to the side-splitting opening scene.DVD extras include: Daisy Dukes: the short short shorts, the General Lee lives, how to launch a muscle car 175 feet in 4 seconds, the hazards of Dukes, the These Boots are Made for Walking music video, additional scenes, unrated additional scenes, bloopers, unrated bloopers, and the theatrical trailer.  Given the choice between this version (the Unrated one) and the theatrical version, I would prefer the latter.  The differences are across-the-board more risqu&eacute;, but less funny.",3,"Fun, If Ultimately Unsatisfying Adaption . . .

It was usually the same stuff every week but big fat Boss Hog could make you laugh without opening his mouth and the car chases were fun. And then there was Catherine Bach as Daisy Duke, who was a pleasure just to look at.In this remake only Ms. Bach's character is recognizable: I've never liked Jessica Simpson - she ranks with Paris Hilton, Britney Speares and Natalie Maines as one of the most vacuous celebrity bimbos out there - but I thought she did a good job in the role of Daisy.Burt Reynolds was a poor choice to play the Mayor, Boss Hog.  Whereas the TV show character was a dumb, bumbling, morbidly obese clown, Reynolds plays a sharp and nefarious Boss Hog.  There is nothing funny about him.Then there are the Duke cousins: They are portrayed as lecherous morons rather than the good natured good-ol-boys that they were on the TV show.The politically correct way the movie deals with the Confederate flag on the roof of the car is enough to make any real Southerners' stomach churn. (Although I currently reside in the Big Apple, I went to graduate school in Louisiana.)  When the movie starts, there is no Confederate flag on the roof of the cousins' car and Cooter adds it without the boys' knowledge.

Kaiser,"[1, 4]","This movie could easily have been a 2 star movie, it's dumb, somewhat funny, and a really silly, brain-dead plot, but the supporting characters won me over for a positive review. Johnny Knoxville and Seann William Scott play the famous Duke brothers, and they are ok, nothing special as nether really stand out, the chemistry between the two is ok, but not strong enough to make you really care about them. Scott is much better in the American Pie movies, and Knoxville was much better in a supporting role in Walking Tall.The one's who steal the movie are Willie Nelson and Jessica Simpson (yes, I said Jessica Simpson) Willie plays Uncle Jesse really well and his jokes are hilarious while his right hook packs quite a punch. Much to my amazement, Jessica Simpson was a blast as Daisy Duke, It just looks like she had alot of fun doing this. This woman is so incredibly gorgeous, and I think she shed some of that 'dumb chick' persona from her 'tuna' episode. She looks so hot in her Daisy shorts, but I think her best lines where when she was seducing Enis for info, those two had a couple of generally funny moments.Burt Reynolds plays Boss Hogg, and I had trouble getting into his character, he is nothing like the Boss Hogg from the TV show. That Hogg was evil, but also lovable, charming and funny, not so much here. Reynolds received very little to work with and I don't  think he was given enough freedom to really make this guy work, cuz' let's face it, Reynolds rules, he is a very good comic actor, so I was kinda let down on this. Cooter is pretty good, but had a limited role, and Enis as I mentioned earlier is fine as well. But another who lacked was Roscoe, I remember loving him from the TV show, but here he has zero expression and very little interaction with his dog Flash, which was always funny.As for the plot (who cares) it revolves around Bo and Luke saving the farm and Hazard County from Boss Hogg who is buying up everyone's land so he can turn it into a strip mine. Sounds pretty lame huh? Well, it is, but atleast we have the General Lee to ease that pain. This car kicks alot of ass and soars over alot of jumps and squeals and skids around many corners, I guess they went through some 33 cars for the action chase scenes with no CGI, and for that I give them much love.Oh, by the way, you know that 'unrated' tag I'm always bitchin' about in some of my other reviews?........it's back!!! This one has it too, but atleast this time we know why, for all you men out there it enables you to see lots of boobs in a scene where the brothers are looking for a girl in a dorm where all the girls are topless, amazing timing huh? The language is also pretty strong in this as well, so a PG-13 would not have fit.So, as Roger Ebert would say, a mild thumbs up. Go see it for Jessica and Wiilie, and of course, the General Lee. It's really dumb and lacking in alot of areas, but mostly amusing, and did I mention Jessica Simpson looks sexy as ever in this? oh, sorry, wasn't sure.acting..........3 stars, Scott and Knoxville are fine, but it's Nelson and Simpson and a certain car that rule the finedirecting.........2.5 stars, Not expertly made, but is that really possible when you think about the subject matter?special effects....3.5 stars, Great chase scenescomedy rating......3 stars, Some funny lines, Nelson's jokes are the best partquality...........2.5 stars, Very choppy, some poor shots during chase scenes, and not enough Jessica.....just kidding.",3,This is a very generous 3 stars here.............,1135296000,"12 23, 2005",2005,3483,"['movie', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', '2', 'star', 'movie', 'dumb', 'somewhat', 'funny', 'really', 'silly', 'brain-dead', 'plot', 'supporting', 'characters', 'won', 'over', 'positive', 'review', 'Johnny', 'Knoxville', 'Seann', 'William', 'Scott', 'play', 'famous', 'Duke', 'brothers', 'are', 'ok', 'nothing', 'special', 'nether', 'really', 'stand', 'out', 'chemistry', 'two', 'ok', 'not', 'strong', 'enough', 'make', 'really', 'care', 'Scott', 'much', 'better', 'American', 'Pie', 'movies', 'Knoxville', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'supporting', 'role', 'Walking', 'Tall.The', 'one', 'who', 'steal', 'movie', 'are', 'Willie', 'Nelson', 'Jessica', 'Simpson', 'yes', 'said', 'Jessica', 'Simpson', 'Willie', 'Uncle', 'Jesse', 'really', 'well', 'jokes', 'are', 'hilarious', 'right', 'hook', 'quite', 'punch', 'Much', 'amazement', 'Jessica', 'Simpson', 'was', 'blast', 'Daisy', 'Duke', 'just', 'had', 'alot', 'fun', 'doing', 'woman', 'so', 'incredibly', 'gorgeous', 'think', 'shed', ""'dumb"", 'chick', 'persona', ""'tuna"", 'episode', 'so', 'hot', 'Daisy', 'shorts', 'think', 'best', 'lines', 'where', 'when', 'was', 'seducing', 'Enis', 'info', 'two', 'had', 'couple', 'generally', 'funny', 'moments.Burt', 'Reynolds', 'Boss', 'Hogg', 'had', 'trouble', 'getting', 'character', 'nothing', 'Boss', 'Hogg', 'TV', 'show', 'Hogg', 'was', 'evil', 'also', 'lovable', 'charming', 'funny', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'here', 'Reynolds', 'received', 'very', 'little', 'work', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'given', 'enough', 'freedom', 'really', 'make', 'guy', 'work', 'cuz', 'let', 'face', 'Reynolds', 'rules', 'very', 'good', 'comic', 'actor', 'was', 'kinda', 'let', 'down', 'Cooter', 'pretty', 'good', 'had', 'limited', 'role', 'Enis', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'fine', 'as', 'well', 'who', 'lacked', 'was', 'Roscoe', 'remember', 'loving', 'TV', 'show', 'here', 'zero', 'expression', 'very', 'little', 'interaction', 'dog', 'Flash', 'was', 'always', 'funny.As', 'plot', 'who', 'Bo', 'Luke', 'saving', 'farm', 'Hazard', 'County', 'Boss', 'Hogg', 'who', 'buying', 'up', 'everyone', 'land', 'can', 'turn', 'strip', 'mine', 'pretty', 'lame', 'huh', 'Well', 'have', 'General', 'Lee', 'ease', 'pain', 'car', 'alot', 'ass', 'soars', 'alot', 'jumps', 'squeals', 'skids', 'many', 'corners', 'guess', 'went', '33', 'cars', 'action', 'chase', 'scenes', 'CGI', 'give', 'much', 'love.Oh', 'way', 'know', ""'unrated"", 'tag', ""'m"", 'always', 'bitchin', 'other', 'reviews', '..it', 'back', 'one', 'too', 'time', 'know', 'why', 'men', 'see', 'lots', 'boobs', 'scene', 'where', 'brothers', 'are', 'looking', 'girl', 'dorm', 'where', 'girls', 'are', 'topless', 'amazing', 'timing', 'huh', 'language', 'also', 'pretty', 'strong', 'as', 'well', 'PG-13', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'fit.So', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'would', 'say', 'mild', 'up', 'Go', 'see', 'Jessica', 'Wiilie', 'course', 'General', 'Lee', 'really', 'dumb', 'lacking', 'alot', 'areas', 'mostly', 'amusing', 'did', 'mention', 'Jessica', 'Simpson', 'sexy', 'ever', 'oh', 'sorry', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure.acting', '.3', 'stars', 'Scott', 'Knoxville', 'are', 'fine', 'Nelson', 'Simpson', 'certain', 'car', 'finedirecting', '2.5', 'stars', 'Not', 'expertly', 'made', 'really', 'possible', 'when', 'think', 'subject', 'matter', 'special', 'effects', '.3.5', 'stars', 'Great', 'chase', 'scenescomedy', 'rating', '3', 'stars', 'funny', 'lines', 'Nelson', 'jokes', 'are', 'best', 'partquality', '..2.5', 'stars', 'Very', 'choppy', 'poor', 'shots', 'chase', 'scenes', 'not', 'enough', 'Jessica', '..just', 'kidding']",N/A

I remember seeing the original shows as a kid (reruns but hey I still had the whole collection of all the matchbox sized cars for them). The original Dukes of Hazzards would honestly be hard to copy in todays society. Not many movies (actually I can't think of one at the moment) that are either a remake of a movie or based on a tv show rarely closely related to its original. Everything is made for ""now times"" since the past 20 years have changed. Now a lot of people are complaining as this has swearing and sex in it. ok yes you see a scene of nudity but whats funny is that theres not many movies except for Disney movies which don't have some sort of swearing in it. If you don't believe me think about whats acceptable to say now that wouldn't be acceptable 20 years ago. I hear more swearing on a playground than any movie produces. Hell watch TV shows on nowadays and they swear all the time. Also sex nowadays is the #1 commodity in the United States and It would be hard to say that someone doesn't have some sex related thing that a kid can't get their hands on (yes that magazine on the coffee table has sex stuff in it with its advertising. Watch Spongebob Squarepants, Shrek, or any popular kids show and movie and if they don't have some sort of suggestive sex or swearing in it, i'd be shocked. (thats what I loved about Rugrats, every episode of them had some suggestion of sex or swearing in it and no one ever cared). Ok went way off topic but its true, remaking this movie to be like the 70's show would make it harder for todays society to watch it since it would need the action, car chases, sex (whats makes hollywood lots of money so its gotta be in almost every movie) and swearing which as i said, go to any playground and you will hear kids swear, and i'm talking the high class private schools as well. I personally think the movie was well done though it did seem to move too fast through plots but its no Braveheart so I don't think you need to develop to much into the characters as you can already guess their personality even if you've never watched the TV show. Now if you loved the TV show and got this DVD would you like it? Hard to say as you would have to keep a open mind about changing of times. Also the characteristics of some characters are different. But its still has uts humor and action of the old show, just with a new millenuim twist. Besides, you have to laugh towards the end what happens when Daisy tries to lure the cops away from the courthouse.

943868,ATS1HA5M3EPZ4,B000BKJ74Y,"J. Elmquist ""Moviephile""","[3, 6]","No one can really be held accountable for wanting to see this movie.  As it is so common these days, the marketing dept makes the trailer look great using Spiderbait's version of Black Betty intercut with car chase scenes and Jessica Simpson kicking some rude sap to the floor (her best scene in the movie).  They made her look great.  They made the General Lee look great.  Ah, the genius of marketing.  Despite this, seeing the movie means dealing with a dumbed down version of the characters from the beloved show a lot of us grew up with.  First off I will say I thought the movie was a lot of fun.  Silly fun though, something you watch with your brain in low-brow mode.Now to compare it with the show (and if you make a remake, comparisons are going to happen), I can see why none of the original actors wanted to make a cameo.  First off, I didn't mind seeing Knoxville play Luke Duke, he has an insane charisma about himself that makes him watchable.  Scott was just fine as Bo, although his fear of talking to girls is totally opposite from the show.  Both looked really scruffy and low class, though.Overall, Bo and Luke are made out to be girl chasin', police avoiding, dim-witted, moonshine runnin' hillbillies.  Now, I don't have a problem with the girl chasing or running from police.  And Bo was the less intellectual of the two but made up for it with his driving skill which is reflected in the movie.  Luke was actually pretty sharp in the show.  But the real problem I have is that these guys are actually running Moonshine...what the hell?!  Now, I'm not a prude but this makes them criminals right off the bat.  And it was something that made you sympathize with them in the show; they were always being chased by the cops for something they didn't do, so you were rooting for them.  Moonshine running is something their Uncle Jesse did back in the day but stopped because he had to raise the three cousins and most likely wanted to raise them correctly.  And as a side note, how is it that one uncle gets stuck with three cousins?!  They each had their own parents.  They're all cousins.  This means Jesse had at least three siblings.  What happened to all of them?  Was it some tragically bizarre family reunion catastrophe that took them all?  If so, why weren't the kids there?  Why wasn't Jesse there?  Hmmm.But I digress.  Well, not totally.  Speaking of Uncle Jesse, the gentle soul of the TV show was a morally upstanding (possibly religious) citizen that scolded the boys (and girl) for saying `shoot' or `heck'.  He made them pray before eating.  He had them working on the farm for a living.  Now Willie Nelson steps in and cusses like a drunken sailor, throws Molotov cocktails into traffic, produces moonshine in a hidden room, tells dirty jokes and condones Daisy's language when she referrers to how she'll have to `shake her ass' in order to get the boys out of jail.  Did I mention he can't act?It seems the original concept of `good `ol boys' has been grossly reshaped.  Where the show used to imply it meant good southern people being mis-interrpreted and wrongly accused, the movie now implies that it means southern hicks who are just sly enough to keep from getting caught.  Unfortunately there is no sympathy for the latter, and in the end there isn't much to cheer for.However, comparisons aside, the movie is fun to watch if you never saw the show.  I have to give kudos to one scene of genius where the cousins have to go to Atlanta and while sitting in traffic are heckled by surrounding drivers either praising them or shunning them for driving a car with a confederate flag painted on the roof.

Saying she should stick with her day job and then saying, maybe she shouldn't even stick with that. With House of Wax, they said critics were just picking on Paris Hilton and that she wasn't that bad. I  think the same could be said with Jessica Simpson here. She was mis-casted and looks more like Daisy Duke went to hollywood, than cowgirl. Still I don't see where she does any harm to the movie. Anyway Ebert was also too hard on the movie. If they could give Starsky and Hutch 2 thumbs up then why not the Dukes of Hazzard ? It's not like it's either better or worse than Starsky and Hutch anyway.Sean William Scott steals the show as Bo Duke, who's in love with her car he calls General Lee. Him being in love with that car in the late 70's and mid 80's may have worked but here it's just funny. Compared to cars these days, General Lee is a hunk of junk lol. Anyway he's in best character form. While Jessica Simpson looks like she just walked off the set of a video and Johny Knoxville looks like he just got done filiming an episode of Jackass. I'm not even sure why Knoxville got top billing, he's more like the side-kick than the lead star. It's Scott who pretty much carries the movie. Don't get me wrong, Knoxville and Scott do have chemestry and are great fun together.  But Scott's nutty performance and Jessica Simpson in tight little out-fits are the best things about the movie. With his beard that makes him look like a monkey, Scott is the only one who trys to look like he didn't just walk out of his trailer. He becomes the character and isn't just playing Stiffler. While Burt Reynolds is just being...Burt Reynolds, he was a bad choice for Boss Hog. Willie Nelson as Uncle Jesse though is hilarious. Especially his scene where he gets drunk from his Moon Shine before he has to set it on fire and throw some bottles at the cops. His jokes that he tells Luke Duke while doing that, is probably one of the movies funnier scenes.

I'm appauled as a fan of the series, and I can't belive what they turned this franchise into.  As fans of the original show probably know, many of the original cast members were against this movie from the start. Ben Jones (Cooter) on his home page actually attempted to deter fans from seeing the movie at all as he thought it was shameful no matter how you sliced it.  You can see why when you attempt to watch this mindless movie. It's trailer trash city, with nothing redeeming along the way. They might have as well called this movie ""Porkys 4"" as the clean spirited history of the show is all shot down to flames in this God awful movie.  Even worse they released this unwarranted ""unrated"" version which is ""trashier"" than the theatrical release which just gives you more ""breast visuals"". You'll experience swearing, Uncle Jessie smoking dope, bare breasted college girls, sexual innuendos throughout the movie, poor acting, poor actors and what is with Daisy (Jessica Simpson) becoming a stupid blonde anyway?I won't even bother with plot as some of my fellow reviewers have mentioned. But even when you take out the sexual stuff, there is still not a single enjoyable moment to be had.  It's a bad movie no matter how you slice it. The only saving grace is that the soundtrack is decent and the classic Theme from Waylon Jennings is all intact. Why wouldn't Warner Brothers go back to the original cast to get some story ideas and leave the boobs for the rated R movies? And some cameos from the original Dukes would have been sweet.

What blows my mind is how could anyone at this studio truly believe that this movie would be a good idea?  Who knows, but obviously someone thought it was movie-gold and that's why we are treated with this utter crap-fest starring raunchy comedians Seann William Scott ('American Pie Trilogy' and ""The Rundown"") and Johnny Knoxville (MTV's ""Jackass"" and ""Men In Black 2""), along with country legend Willie Nelson, and sexy siren Jessica Simpson, known as ""The Dukes of Hazzard"".""The Dukes of Hazzard"" follows the raunchy, dimwitted exploits of cousins Bo (Seann William Scott) and Luke (Johnny Knoxville) Duke.  Throughout their escapades, the cousins stumble upon a dastardly plot by the county's evil commissioner, Boss Hogg (Burt Reynolds), who seeks to level numerous farms in Hazzard County to begin a coal mining operation.  Discovering that their family farm is on the chopping block, the Dukes along with Daisy (Jessica Simpson) and Uncle Jesse (Willie Nelson) attempt to thwart this evil from occurring and become the towns heroes instead of zeroes.There are so many ways to describe just how bad this movie is, lets take a moment to list some of those ways.  Well, it's a boring, idiotic, utterly perverted, not even that funny, waste of time.  After watching this movie I felt like I was dumber from the experience.  The humorous elements, what little there was, comes not from the two lead actors, but from Jessica Simpson's Daisy Duke.  Out of the entire cast, not only is she the most attractive, but also the funniest, though to be fair I must admit that I'm probably being overly kind to her on account of her sex appeal.  There is very little about this movie that can even be deemed as entertaining.  It is evident that the director and the movie studio didn't set out to do an accurate adaptation of the classic TV show, but instead to make just another raunchy, teen comedy (except they forget to include the comedy).

But I am no fan of this movie.The plot is pretty much the same as the original TV show. Boss and Roscoe are after the Duke boys because they think they're hiding a moonshine still. And the Dukes are running from them in their pride and joy, the General Lee. But other than that, the show has been entirely changed. The movie is filled with car scenes, Jessica parading around in barely-there outfit, and the Duke brothers screaming insults at one another. Now, how does that compare to the original, wholesome show? I'll admit that the movie did need to be updated a bit and no one could do as well as the original actors, but the only person who acted like he had any talent was Seann William Scott as Bo Duke. At least he made a couple of lines humorous. But Johnny Knoxville? I'm from Knoxville, and believe me, I'm not proud that Johnny's from there too. He's just a redneck who gets paid for acting like one. He had no similarity to Luke, the director just needed somebody from the south. Jessica Simpson is beautiful and sweet, but she needs to stick with singing. I mean, did anybody buy that fake southern accent? And Willie Nelson is nice, but he didn't put on a spectacular performance. Burt Reynolds didn't do anyone any justice either. The whole movie was just cussing and rude gestures with a few funny moments. The script wasn't well written and the plot wasn't interesting. All in all, the car made the movie. The General Lee was the only thing that wasn't changed or made over. The car scenes are the only thing this movie has going for it, trust me.

Not only is the story completely and utterly stupid, this movie relates to the original in name only.  Since when did Uncle Jesse become a pot-smoking fart?  The old ""Dukes"" was pure fun.  Yeah, these days it seems very silly to watch, but when I was just a youngster, I thought that the ""Dukes"" was one of the greatest shows around.  This film, on the other hand, was created strictly for titillation and to take a slap at Southern folks.  I can't believe that Junior Brown lent his voice to be the balladeer of this trash.  I can understand why Johnny Knoxville and Seann William Scott jumped on this ship.  Both of them wanted a challenging role.  After seeing ""Bulletproof Monk,"" I thought Scott had redeemed himself a little.  However, with this flick, he's back to being an idiot in my  opinion.  And then we have Jessica Simpson.  She's proven once and for all that she is only good to look at and nothing else.  Willie Nelson and Burt Reynolds are worthless in their depictions of Uncle Jesse and Boss Hogg.  Not only do they not look the part for the roles, they just don't look right in this film.Only two things save this flick from being a total loss, the soundtrack and the General Lee.  With some choice Southern Rock from legends like Lynyrd Skynyrd and some well-picked sounds from unknowns like Southern Culture on the Skids, the soundtrack almost makes this flick worth a look.  The General Lee is nice to see on the screen.  It's a beautiful thing to see that old Charger roaring down the dirt road.Other than that, this film just isn't funny.  Not even the stereotypes are funny.  It's almost as if director Jay Chandrasekhar was intent on making a film that re-invents the ""Dukes"" as a couple of idiot hillbillies that the Yankees can laugh at.  If any Yanks think this is funny, please explain it to me, because I don't see much of anything funny here.Stay away from this junk.  It is a rare occasion when I say a film is this terrible.  In fact, the only other film I've ever rated with Two Stars is the sci-fi miscue, ""Sasquatch.""  Don't watch this flick.  Pick up the old series for some goodtime fun.

One of the questions I found myself asking was: Why would someone take a terrible television show and make it into a movie?  Every actor in this movie gives the worst performance in his or her career, especially Jessica Simpson, whose Daisy Duke is the most over the top, albeit gorgeous, characters I have ever seen.  The movie is filled with scenes of the Duke boys screaming at the top of their lungs, once again proving that neither of them could have possibly made it into middle school.  The scene where they impersonate Japanese people is just plain laughable (not in a good way) and you have to wonder how the kid who believed them ever got into college.  Willie Nelson's Uncle Jesse is one of the most annoying characters in modern cinema, telling terrible joke after terrible joke.

Jessica Simpson provides the eye candy as Daisy Duke, and while Willie Nelson as Uncle Jesse and Burt Reynolds as Boss Hogg are solid casting, they can't save this turkey.  The humor is good natured for the most part, and there's plenty of stunts that try to pay homage to the series, but nothing really takes off.  All in all, the Dukes of Hazzard movie can't come close to being the bona-fide guilty camp pleasure of the original series, and should be avoided by all, even those who want to droll over Simpson and die hard fans of the series.  And by the way, I don't care what anyone else says: Jessica Simpson is not as sexy as Daisy Duke as Catherine Bach was, and that's the truth.",1,Absolutely terrible,1165449600,"12 7, 2006",2006,1253,"[""'ll"", 'admit', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'be', 'bad', 'Then', 'again', 'what', 'get', 'thinking', 'Broken', 'Lizard', 'Jay', 'Chandrasekhar', 'who', 'directed', 'comedy', 'troupe', 'movies', 'Super', 'Troopers', 'Club', 'Dread', 'Beer', 'Fest', 'as', 'well', 'episodes', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'was', 'given', 'task', 'remake', 'cult', 'TV', 'series', 'big', 'screen', 'results', 'are', 'deliriously', 'bad', 'Johnny', 'Knoxville', 'Seann', 'William', 'Scott', 'are', 'Bo', 'Luke', 'idea', 'may', 'sound', 'good', 'paper', 'results', 'are', 'nothing', 'good', 'Jessica', 'Simpson', 'eye', 'candy', 'Daisy', 'Duke', 'Willie', 'Nelson', 'Uncle', 'Jesse', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'Boss', 'Hogg', 'are', 'solid', 'casting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'turkey', 'humor', 'good', 'natured', 'most', 'part', 'plenty', 'stunts', 'try', 'pay', 'homage', 'series', 'nothing', 'really', 'off', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'come', 'close', 'being', 'bona-fide', 'guilty', 'camp', 'pleasure', 'original', 'series', 'should', 'be', 'avoided', 'even', 'who', 'want', 'droll', 'Simpson', 'die', 'hard', 'fans', 'series', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'anyone', 'else', 'Jessica', 'Simpson', 'not', 'as', 'sexy', 'Daisy', 'Duke', 'Catherine', 'Bach', 'was', 'truth']",N/A

Having not seen much of the TV Series, I decided that I wouldn't understand or ""get"" this film as much as the die-hard fans would.I was so, so, so wrong. This film was a really great offering from one of the team of ""Broken Lizard"" - Jay Chandrasekhar - who were responsible for Super Troopers and Club Dread. They've come along way from real toilet humour and bad acting and with the help of Johnny ""Jackass"" Knoxville and Sean William Scott, along with Willie Nelson and Burt Reynolds... really pull off a great action-comedy flick.Of course - the highlight of the film - will more than likely be one on two things : THE GENERAL LEE - the monster 5.7L V8 HEMI beast that is responsible for most of the action. The DUKES American Muscle Car or JESSICA SIMPSON - The Dukes Cousin :DAISY - who parades around in either tight, short, very, very, very, very short jeans or a Pink Bikini. We'll take her anyway we can get her.THE STORY : Cousins Bo and Luke Duke are running Uncle Jessie's Moon Shine Business, racing The General Lee and starting fist fights in local bars. The normal day in the life of the Dukes. But when Evil Old BOSS HOGG (played to the Ultimate Camp by the ever reliable BURT REYNOLDS) gets up to his old tricks - the DUKES with the Help of Uncle Jessie and DAISY decide to stop HOGG in his tracks.Throw in enough car chases, bar brawls, flying muscle cars, scantily clad Simpson, and a few absolutely fantastic cameo rolls by THE BROKEN LIZARD TEAM : Even a clever re-hash of the Famous Opening Scene in SUPER TROOPERS plus the 70th ANNUAL HAZARD COUNTY ROAD RACE and you've got 100 MINUTES OF GOOD OLD CLEAN ACTION.This one reminded me of the first time I watched SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT... and that's always A WINNER.The UNRATED EDITION purely adds a lot of TOPLESS NUDITY and not much else!!!",5,"WHAT A GREAT FILM = SHOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED ""SMOKEY, BURT + THE BANDITS""",1138060800,"01 24, 2006",2006,1838,"['was', 'real', 'surprise', 'Having', 'not', 'seen', 'much', 'TV', 'Series', 'decided', 'would', ""n't"", 'understand', 'get', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'would.I', 'was', 'so', 'so', 'wrong', 'film', 'was', 'really', 'great', 'offering', 'one', 'team', 'Broken', 'Lizard', 'Jay', 'Chandrasekhar', 'who', 'were', 'responsible', 'Super', 'Troopers', 'Club', 'Dread', ""'ve"", 'come', 'way', 'real', 'toilet', 'humour', 'bad', 'acting', 'help', 'Johnny', 'Jackass', 'Knoxville', 'Sean', 'William', 'Scott', 'Willie', 'Nelson', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'really', 'pull', 'off', 'great', 'action-comedy', 'flick.Of', 'course', 'highlight', 'film', 'will', 'more', 'likely', 'be', 'one', 'two', 'things', 'GENERAL', 'LEE', 'monster', '5.7L', 'V8', 'HEMI', 'beast', 'responsible', 'most', 'action', 'DUKES', 'American', 'Muscle', 'Car', 'JESSICA', 'SIMPSON', 'Dukes', 'Cousin', 'DAISY', 'who', 'parades', 'tight', 'short', 'very', 'very', 'very', 'very', 'short', 'jeans', 'Pink', 'Bikini', ""'ll"", 'take', 'anyway', 'can', 'get', 'her.THE', 'STORY', 'Cousins', 'Bo', 'Luke', 'Duke', 'are', 'running', 'Uncle', 'Jessie', 'Moon', 'Shine', 'Business', 'racing', 'General', 'Lee', 'starting', 'fist', 'fights', 'local', 'bars', 'normal', 'day', 'life', 'Dukes', 'when', 'Evil', 'Old', 'BOSS', 'HOGG', 'played', 'Ultimate', 'Camp', 'ever', 'reliable', 'BURT', 'REYNOLDS', 'up', 'old', 'tricks', 'DUKES', 'Help', 'Uncle', 'Jessie', 'DAISY', 'decide', 'stop', 'HOGG', 'tracks.Throw', 'enough', 'car', 'chases', 'bar', 'brawls', 'flying', 'muscle', 'cars', 'scantily', 'clad', 'Simpson', 'few', 'absolutely', 'fantastic', 'cameo', 'rolls', 'THE', 'BROKEN', 'LIZARD', 'TEAM', 'Even', 'clever', 're-hash', 'Famous', 'Opening', 'Scene', 'SUPER', 'TROOPERS', '70th', 'ANNUAL', 'HAZARD', 'COUNTY', 'ROAD', 'RACE', ""'ve"", 'got', '100', 'MINUTES', 'OF', 'GOOD', 'OLD', 'CLEAN', 'ACTION.This', 'one', 'reminded', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'SMOKEY', 'AND', 'THE', 'BANDIT', 'always', 'A', 'WINNER.The', 'UNRATED', 'EDITION', 'purely', 'lot', 'TOPLESS', 'NUDITY', 'not', 'much', 'else']",N/A
943906,A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ,B000BKJ74Y,Nicholas Carroll,"[3, 9]","Ben ""Cooter"" Jones came out before this movie hit theaters telling fans of the TV show to skip this film adaptation for its raunchy sexuality that fails to pay tribute to ""the family values"" of the popular TV show. Considering that Mr. Jones was once my Congressman and someone I respected, I did keep his critique in mind as I watched this. I missed the film in theaters but knew I'd eventually see it on DVD for I thought the casting choice was very interesting.First of all, selecting Jessica Simpson as Daisy Duke won me over to this film. I like her and wanted to see if she could act, but disappointingly so, she's not that great of an actress. She does a passable job, though her main goal in this film was looking good for the camera. Her one-liners though should have been thrown out during the re-writes (were there re-writes?). Willie Nelson as Uncle Jesse was another interesting choice, but he was pretty much assigned to cracking some very raunchy jokes as he tossed explosives from the car. Linda Carter, another staples from 1970s television, has such a blink and you missed it role. Burt Reynolds as Boss Hogg? Interesting I thought, but no one could fill the original guy's shoes to begin with. Burt didn't even try. I miss the original Roscoe P. Coletrain's laugh/snicker. Seann William Scott (Stifler!) as Bo and Johnny Knoxville as Luke were also interesting choices. They did a great job, I thought, but it's hard not to mess this up, with all their innuendos and good ole boy fun.Now, about the adult humour...there was a gratuitious T&A; shot that I don't think worked, but the jokes were good fun. If you're going to bring an old TV show onto the big screen, it has to be different from the show. Either amp up the special effects, pick a great cast, have a brilliant script/story, or go for raunch that wouldn't make it past TV censors. Raunch wins the day on this one. The story is marginal, but works for this type of movie...Boss Hogg bends the law to steal Uncle Jesse's farm so he can strip mine the place; which happens during a very convenient car race to distract the citizens of Hazzard County from voicing their objections.What I like most about this film (besides Jessica Simpson in all her booty-shaking glory) is the scene in which other drivers make comments on the General Lee's rooftop Confederate Flag. We had that debate in Georgia a few years back and it was nice to see that kind of debate on film. I especially loved the detour through a rougher neighborhood as we get African Americans commenting on the Duke boys racist roof. I don't remember ever seeing a single African American on TV's Hazzard County, so it's a refereshing update for the modern era.The story line at the college in Atlanta was wasteful, and it's so obviously NOT Atlanta (New Orleans stands in for Atlanta) for those of us who live here...but other than that, the film is pretty funny in its raunchy humor and the good natured fun between Bo and Luke Duke. However, the whole time, I kept thinking of STIFLER! from the American Pie movies. Seann William Scott is in serious danger of typecasting forever if he doesn't branch out into other roles. I believe this is Johnny Knoxville's first acting role and I was surprised that he wasn't too bad. He probably has the most to benefit from this film.So, if you're watching this film, don't expect some high-brow entertainment. See it for what it is...just some good ole' boys, who don't mean any harm. If raunchy humor offends you, stay clear of this movie...but for guys like me, that's what made this movie better than expected. A little bit of raunch can go a very long way in keeping up the laughs. For the jokes that fall flat, there was Jessica Simpson's perfect form to ease the wincing pain of bad comedy.",4,Good ole' boys that don't mean any harm!,1135641600,"12 27, 2005",2005,3780,"['Ben', 'Cooter', 'Jones', 'came', 'out', 'movie', 'hit', 'theaters', 'telling', 'fans', 'TV', 'show', 'skip', 'film', 'adaptation', 'raunchy', 'sexuality', 'pay', 'tribute', 'family', 'values', 'popular', 'TV', 'show', 'Considering', 'Mr.', 'Jones', 'was', 'once', 'Congressman', 'someone', 'respected', 'did', 'keep', 'critique', 'mind', 'watched', 'missed', 'film', 'theaters', 'knew', ""'d"", 'eventually', 'see', 'DVD', 'thought', 'casting', 'choice', 'was', 'very', 'interesting.First', 'selecting', 'Jessica', 'Simpson', 'Daisy', 'Duke', 'won', 'film', 'wanted', 'see', 'could', 'act', 'disappointingly', 'so', 'not', 'great', 'actress', 'passable', 'job', 'main', 'goal', 'film', 'was', 'looking', 'good', 'camera', 'one-liners', 'though', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'thrown', 'out', 're-writes', 'were', 'there', 're-writes', 'Willie', 'Nelson', 'Uncle', 'Jesse', 'was', 'interesting', 'choice', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'assigned', 'cracking', 'very', 'raunchy', 'jokes', 'tossed', 'explosives', 'car', 'Linda', 'Carter', 'staples', '1970s', 'television', 'blink', 'missed', 'role', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'Boss', 'Hogg', 'Interesting', 'thought', 'one', 'could', 'fill', 'original', 'guy', 'shoes', 'begin', 'Burt', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'try', 'miss', 'original', 'Roscoe', 'P.', 'Coletrain', 'laugh/snicker', 'Seann', 'William', 'Scott', 'Stifler', 'Bo', 'Johnny', 'Knoxville', 'Luke', 'were', 'also', 'interesting', 'choices', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'thought', 'hard', 'not', 'mess', 'up', 'innuendos', 'good', 'ole', 'boy', 'fun.Now', 'adult', 'humour', 'was', 'gratuitious', 'T', 'A', 'shot', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'worked', 'jokes', 'were', 'good', 'fun', ""'re"", 'going', 'bring', 'old', 'TV', 'show', 'big', 'screen', 'be', 'different', 'show', 'amp', 'up', 'special', 'effects', 'pick', 'great', 'cast', 'have', 'brilliant', 'script/story', 'go', 'raunch', 'would', ""n't"", 'make', 'past', 'TV', 'censors', 'Raunch', 'day', 'one', 'story', 'marginal', 'type', 'movie', 'Boss', 'Hogg', 'law', 'steal', 'Uncle', 'Jesse', 'farm', 'can', 'strip', 'mine', 'place', 'very', 'convenient', 'car', 'race', 'distract', 'citizens', 'Hazzard', 'County', 'voicing', 'like', 'most', 'film', 'Jessica', 'Simpson', 'booty-shaking', 'glory', 'scene', 'other', 'drivers', 'make', 'comments', 'General', 'Lee', 'rooftop', 'Confederate', 'Flag', 'had', 'debate', 'Georgia', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'kind', 'debate', 'film', 'especially', 'loved', 'detour', 'rougher', 'neighborhood', 'get', 'African', 'Americans', 'commenting', 'Duke', 'boys', 'racist', 'roof', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'ever', 'seeing', 'single', 'African', 'American', 'TV', 'Hazzard', 'County', 'refereshing', 'update', 'modern', 'era.The', 'story', 'line', 'college', 'Atlanta', 'was', 'wasteful', 'so', 'obviously', 'NOT', 'Atlanta', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Atlanta', 'who', 'live', 'here', 'other', 'film', 'pretty', 'funny', 'raunchy', 'humor', 'good', 'natured', 'fun', 'Bo', 'Luke', 'Duke', 'However', 'whole', 'time', 'kept', 'thinking', 'STIFLER', 'American', 'Pie', 'movies', 'Seann', 'William', 'Scott', 'serious', 'danger', 'typecasting', 'forever', ""n't"", 'branch', 'out', 'other', 'roles', 'believe', 'Johnny', 'Knoxville', 'first', 'acting', 'role', 'was', 'surprised', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'probably', 'most', 'benefit', 'film.So', ""'re"", 'watching', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'high-brow', 'entertainment', 'See', 'what', 'just', 'good', 'ole', 'boys', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'harm', 'raunchy', 'humor', 'stay', 'clear', 'movie', 'guys', 'what', 'made', 'movie', 'better', 'expected', 'little', 'bit', 'raunch', 'can', 'go', 'very', 'long', 'way', 'keeping', 'up', 'laughs', 'jokes', 'fall', 'flat', 'was', 'Jessica', 'Simpson', 'perfect', 'form', 'ease', 'wincing', 'pain', 'bad', 'comedy']",N/A

I was excited when I heard they were making a movie till I found out who was in the cast . . . but I kept an open mind hoping that it would be good anyway. When I saw it my fears were confirmed  . . . this movie stinks! It's not totally awful but the only thing true fans are going to recongnize here is the car. The awesome stunts save the film from its bad casting. Whoever did the casting for this film should be shot. First of all Jessica Simpson is a rotten actress. She is not even that hot they could have gotten someone better . . . actually anyone would have been better. The guys playing Bo and Luke are stupid but they are not the worst thing about this film.  I think Burt Reynolds is off the mark as Boss Hogg. The charm that made the show a success is not here. I think Danny Devito would have been a great Boss Hogg. They needed a comedian as Rosco . . . Rosco was too serious here.  Personally I think Daisy Duke should have been played by Hillary Swank because she has a hillbilly charm and she sort of reminds me of Catherine Bach . . . who by the way is sexy. To all those sad boys out there who think Jessica Simpson was good in this film . . . check out the TV show . . . that is how a woman is suppose to look in the Daisy Duke shorts.  Even by today's standards the origanally Daisy is Hot. No one can replaced Tom Wopat and John Schneider either. The original Bo and Luke weren't stupid . . . they were cool.  I could go on and on here pointing out what could have been done to fix this lame movie but that would be pointless. My reveiw is this . . . the movie is a bomb but it is worth seeing for the stunts alone . . . the car does some amazing jumps. Duke fans are probably going to hate this movie because it is embarrassing. Those who never saw the show or who actually like Jessica Simpson (God Help you) will probably love this film.

First off- this isn'tthe tv show, so anyone who can't get past that leave the room. Let's take it on it's own merits as a movie. Johnny Knoxville is fun in his role, and though it bears no similarity to Tom Wopat, he does bring a certain fun to the film. Stiffler, as Bo, just sucks. Not due to him as an actor, but due to the fact that there is zero, and I mean zero, ""character"" to either character, bo or luke. Jessica Simpson as ""Daisy""? Hell no. Look, there is only one Catherine Bach and frankly she made that character. What is painfully obvious here is that the people that made this never grew up with the dukes. Simpson is fake, plastic, awkward and slutty. Bach was sexy, genuine, real and approachable. Simpsons awkward awful attempts at an accent serve only to make it more plain that she is out of place. I imagine Catherine Bach feels vindicated as this proves beyond doubt there was more to it than the shorts. Reynolds as Hogg? ok, maybe. Willie as Jesse? I'll smoke one with him and suspend disbelief. He looks it but can't carry it. Roscoe? Well, that and enos were the biggest disgraces in the movie, not to mention single dimension pointless characters. One good thing- the scene where the General comes into the race, cop cars in tow, was awesome, and worthy of the real show. Unfortunately everything else feels like people making fun of you for liking the real show, and so for that reason I'll say this- if you've never seen the show, get the movie- it'll kill some time, maybe you'll like it a little. If you've ever seen the show stay the hell away, it just makes you sad for the real thing.",2,It is what it is,1134000000,"12 8, 2005",2005,1722,"[""'m"", 'fan', 'real', 'dukes-', 'admit', 'up', 'front-', 'intend', 'give', 'honest', 'unbiased', 'review', 'First', 'off-', ""isn'tthe"", 'tv', 'show', 'anyone', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'past', 'leave', 'room', 'Let', 'take', 'own', 'merits', 'movie', 'Johnny', 'Knoxville', 'fun', 'role', 'similarity', 'Tom', 'Wopat', 'bring', 'certain', 'fun', 'film', 'Stiffler', 'Bo', 'just', 'sucks', 'Not', 'due', 'actor', 'due', 'fact', 'zero', 'mean', 'zero', 'character', 'character', 'bo', 'luke', 'Jessica', 'Simpson', 'Daisy', 'Hell', 'Look', 'only', 'one', 'Catherine', 'Bach', 'frankly', 'made', 'character', 'What', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'here', 'people', 'made', 'never', 'grew', 'up', 'dukes', 'Simpson', 'fake', 'plastic', 'awkward', 'slutty', 'Bach', 'was', 'sexy', 'genuine', 'real', 'approachable', 'Simpsons', 'awkward', 'awful', 'attempts', 'accent', 'serve', 'only', 'make', 'more', 'plain', 'place', 'imagine', 'Catherine', 'Bach', 'feels', 'vindicated', 'doubt', 'was', 'more', 'shorts', 'Reynolds', 'Hogg', 'ok', 'maybe', 'Willie', 'Jesse', ""'ll"", 'smoke', 'one', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'ca', ""n't"", 'carry', 'Roscoe', 'Well', 'enos', 'were', 'biggest', 'disgraces', 'movie', 'not', 'mention', 'single', 'dimension', 'pointless', 'characters', 'One', 'good', 'thing-', 'scene', 'where', 'General', 'race', 'cop', 'cars', 'tow', 'was', 'awesome', 'worthy', 'real', 'show', 'Unfortunately', 'everything', 'else', 'people', 'making', 'fun', 'liking', 'real', 'show', 'so', 'reason', ""'ll"", 'say', 'this-', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'show', 'get', 'movie-', ""'ll"", 'kill', 'time', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'like', 'little', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'show', 'hell', 'away', 'just', 'sad', 'real', 'thing']",N/A

Johnny Knoxville and Seann William Scott play Luke and Bo Duke, two moon shining, good ol' boy cousins who spend most of their time hurtling around fictional Hazzard County, Georgia, in a souped-up Dodge Charger affectionately named The General.  Jessica Simpson is their hot-mama cousin Daisy Duke, while Burt Reynolds plays Boss Hogg, a corrupt commissioner whose plan to buy up large tracts of land - including the Duke's happy homestead - in order to strip mine the county, serves as the spark for what ""plot"" there is.The lowest-common-denominator screenplay comes replete with caricatures of po`-white-trash Southerners, inane slapstick, overheated car chases and enough cornpone humor to keep Granny Clampett laughing into her triple-x jug of home-brewed whiskey.The movie is clearly both beyond and beneath criticism, yet, I must say, in all fairness, that it's so good-natured in its dumbness, and Scott and Knoxville seem to be having such a fun time knocking about the countryside that it's really kind of hard to get mad at or offended by it.",2,"Honestly, what is there to say about this movie?",1160179200,"10 7, 2006",2006,1192,"['Dukes', 'Hazzard', 'wheel-spinning', 'barrel-scraping', 'big', 'screen', 'version', 'hit', 'TV', 'show', 'late', '1970', 'early', '1980', 'Johnny', 'Knoxville', 'Seann', 'William', 'Scott', 'play', 'Luke', 'Bo', 'Duke', 'two', 'moon', 'shining', 'good', 'ol', 'boy', 'cousins', 'who', 'spend', 'most', 'time', 'hurtling', 'fictional', 'Hazzard', 'County', 'Georgia', 'souped-up', 'Dodge', 'Charger', 'affectionately', 'named', 'General', 'Jessica', 'Simpson', 'hot-mama', 'cousin', 'Daisy', 'Duke', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'Boss', 'Hogg', 'corrupt', 'commissioner', 'plan', 'buy', 'up', 'large', 'tracts', 'land', 'including', 'Duke', 'happy', 'homestead', 'order', 'strip', 'mine', 'county', 'spark', 'what', 'plot', 'is.The', 'lowest-common-denominator', 'screenplay', 'replete', 'caricatures', 'po', '-white-trash', 'Southerners', 'inane', 'slapstick', 'overheated', 'car', 'chases', 'enough', 'cornpone', 'humor', 'keep', 'Granny', 'Clampett', 'laughing', 'triple-x', 'jug', 'home-brewed', 'whiskey.The', 'movie', 'clearly', 'beneath', 'criticism', 'yet', 'must', 'say', 'fairness', 'so', 'good-natured', 'dumbness', 'Scott', 'Knoxville', 'seem', 'be', 'having', 'such', 'fun', 'time', 'knocking', 'countryside', 'really', 'kind', 'hard', 'get', 'mad', 'offended']",N/A

They were unschooled but not stupid.  Contrast this with the movie Duke boys, with their potty mouths, brain-dead actions and, in Bo's case, slightly psychotic behavior.  The movie includes half-nude babes--so much for introducing my kids to a show I really enjoyed 25 years ago!--and ""colorful"" characters such as a dress-wearing kook who was expelled from college for drinking the women's toilet water.  Oh, what a laugh riot.Burt Reynolds as Boss Hogg does a passable job but cannot compare to the original TV Hogg.  The latter's bluster and bellow were hilarious, and his interaction with his inept sheriff and deputies and the Dukes was a mainstay of the series.  The other villains in the movie are merely cut out of the cheapest cardboard available.  Jessica Simpson as Daisy Duke is gorgeous, artificially-padded butt and all, but is much more two-dimensional than Catherine Bach was in the same role.There are great car chase scenes, of course, and the General Lee is as spectacular as ever.  This being Hollywood, unfortunately, it's never explained in the movie why the Hemi-powered Lee cannot get away from the smogmobile cop cars that crash by the dozen behind, in front, and by its sides.Best line of the movie?  When the Dukes in the General Lee are surrounded by a black gang which has noticed the Confederate flag painted on the car's roof.  One gang member calls the Dukes ""hillbillies,"" to which Luke Duke responds that they prefer to be called ""Appalachian-Americans.""  More un-PC humor of this type would have been welcome.If it's a visit to memory lane you want, pass on this movie.

There is female frontal nudity mid flick so if you have kids be warned. If you have teenagers or younger kids you may want to talk to them about valuing woman as people, not as objects because this movie might lead them to think otherwise and also about driving recklessly down dirt roads blind folded because that usually doesn't turn out so well in the real world. If you like Classic Southern Rock as I do you really can't beat this soundtrack; 'One Way Out' Allman Bros, 'Flirten With Disaster' Molly Hatchet, 'Call Me The Breeze' Lynnyrd Skynnyrd, 'Funk 49' Joe Walsh, 'La Grange' ZZ Top and more. Without getting too long winded, the plot is plausible, the portrayal of known characters acceptable; in fact William Scott brings a new dimension to John Schneider's Bo Duke by making him inept around woman yet a savant behind the wheel.I've found this to be true of many people with unique gifts or obsessions. The movie is a big budget hoot and it doesn't take itself seriously in the least. Jessica Simpson tears it up as Daisy Duke. She's drop dead sexy manipulative, takes no crap and is 100% loyal to her family. We all wish we had sisters like that !  Her music video nicely updates the Nancy Sinatra original pop hit, 'These Boots Are Made For Walkin'.Jessica even re-writes many of the lines to fit her own style.

They steal core samples from a trailer and tested them to find out what they were. They win the Hazzard county race and save Hazzard County just in time. This movie is a great movie.I really like this movie because I have always watched the Dukes of Hazzard. Older people may not like this newer movie because it isn't like the older TV version. Children under thirteen probably shouldn't watch this unrated movie because it has women's nudity at the college that they go visit and because of the language.

Sarhan ""matured reviewer""","[3, 6]","It's become a familiar trend in Hollywood over the past few years that almost every successful hit TV series from the past is being remade into a motion picture, take Bewitched, and the upcoming Dallas. The producers of The Dukes Of Hazzard had an idea of turning the series into a farce comedy starring Jackass, Johnny Knoxville, American Pie's Stifler, Seann William Scott, and the world's most famous dumb blonde, Jessica Simpson, as the three Dukes: Luke, Bo and Daisy. They even got country singer Willie Nelson as uncle Jesse (no, not that guy from Full House) Duke.If you're into fast action and silly jokes, then you're in for a blast. If not, don't waste your time.Knoxville and Scott are the headlining pair of Dukes, Luke and Bo, who are determined to bring down Boss Hogg's, played by Burt Reynolds in his quirkiest role ever, ambition to turn the Duke boys farm into a coal mine. Daisy with her eye popping curvaceous body and very low cut jean shorts is there to lure all the big boys away from stopping the Dukes.The movie wasn't made to be taken seriously, and that's why I didn't. But I gave enough attention to laugh a few times, watch the famous General Lee fly in the air more than a couple times, and come to perfect conclusion that Knoxville and Scott are two of the goofiest and stupidest actors of our time, and Simpson is a very sexy babe (but, too bad she's dumb!).I was generous to give this movie 3 stars, simply because I've seen worse movies this year, for it's humor.Mildly recommendedC",3,These Dukes are gonna walk all over you,1135296000,"12 23, 2005",2005,1517,"['become', 'familiar', 'trend', 'Hollywood', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'almost', 'successful', 'hit', 'TV', 'series', 'past', 'being', 'remade', 'motion', 'picture', 'take', 'Bewitched', 'upcoming', 'Dallas', 'producers', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', 'had', 'idea', 'turning', 'series', 'farce', 'comedy', 'starring', 'Jackass', 'Johnny', 'Knoxville', 'American', 'Pie', 'Stifler', 'Seann', 'William', 'Scott', 'world', 'most', 'famous', 'dumb', 'blonde', 'Jessica', 'Simpson', 'three', 'Dukes', 'Luke', 'Bo', 'Daisy', 'even', 'got', 'country', 'singer', 'Willie', 'Nelson', 'uncle', 'Jesse', 'not', 'guy', 'Full', 'House', 'Duke.If', ""'re"", 'fast', 'action', 'silly', 'jokes', 'then', ""'re"", 'blast', 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time.Knoxville', 'Scott', 'are', 'headlining', 'pair', 'Dukes', 'Luke', 'Bo', 'who', 'are', 'determined', 'bring', 'down', 'Boss', 'Hogg', 'played', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'quirkiest', 'role', 'ever', 'ambition', 'turn', 'Duke', 'farm', 'coal', 'mine', 'Daisy', 'eye', 'popping', 'curvaceous', 'body', 'very', 'low', 'cut', 'jean', 'shorts', 'there', 'lure', 'big', 'boys', 'away', 'stopping', 'Dukes.The', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'made', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'gave', 'enough', 'attention', 'laugh', 'few', 'times', 'watch', 'famous', 'General', 'Lee', 'fly', 'air', 'more', 'couple', 'times', 'come', 'perfect', 'conclusion', 'Knoxville', 'Scott', 'are', 'two', 'goofiest', 'stupidest', 'actors', 'time', 'Simpson', 'very', 'sexy', 'babe', 'too', 'bad', 'dumb', '.I', 'was', 'generous', 'give', 'movie', '3', 'stars', 'simply', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'worse', 'movies', 'year', 'humor.Mildly', 'recommendedC']",N/A

Something with his voice i didnt like in this movie.  Bo and Luke Duke Never wore their shirt out of their pants, and they almost always wore belts Luke, Tom Wompat,  never wore sunglasses in the show but did in here . And another thing that the Dukes never cussed, not that i dont  but they probably just threw that in there. Bo Duke, John Shnieder never really  had a beard. and whats with Bo eating a lollipopor listening to Air Supply in the vehicle ?? lol  Rasco Coaltrain as  in James Best who Played Rasco  P Coaltrain  was never fat in the Tv show.

943932,A1RIF1ZKGS3P7R,B000BKJ74Y,"STFmaryville ""Needs More Money""","[1, 5]","It was bound to happen and it finally has. ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" has now become a major motion picture and you know what, I loved it! As I've stated in several of my past reviews, Hollywood is on a remake kick that has lasted about ten years now and it shows no sign of slowing down. Ok, I'm not that opposed to taking the small screen to the big one so long as it's done right. I'm not sure if ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" was done right, but it contained some of the funniest scenes I've seen in the last few years. Granted the movie itself isn't that great, it's these scenes that have no place in the movie that make it funny and, yes, entertaining. For those familiar with the late 70's/early 80's show the plot will make absolute sense. And for those who aren't familiar with it, it'll take about 20 minutes and then the plot will make sense. The whole gang is here with Bo, Luke, Daisy Duke, Boss Hogg, Enos and Cooter. Dare I say it...""Yee Haw""!We meet Bo (Seann William Scott) and cousin Luke (Johnny Knoxville) as they're once again on the run from the Hazzard county sheriff's. A couple of jumps over streams later, they've escaped once again. They run moonshine, something that is evidently common even in 21st century rural Georgia. The plot, for lack of a better word, is pretty simple: The boys must save their farm from the evil Boss Hogg (Burt Reynolds) when they discover that he has plans to strip mine the town and benefit from the natural resources. Local celebrity Dil Driscoll (Michael Roof) will be doing a charity NASCAR-tupe event to distract the town while the strip mining matter is going through the appeals process in court. Long story short, there's everything that made the show fun. Plenty of good-looking women (and in the movie, many are naked), fast car chases and the perpetually drunk Uncle Jessie (Willie Nelson).""The Dukes of Hazzard"" certainly won't win any Academy Awards, but I actually had a great time watching it. Jessica Simpson's physical appearance is to die for, but I don't think this chick has more than a handful of functioning brain cells (word has it that most of her scenes ended up on the cutting-room floor). Seann William Scott and Knoxville play very well off each other but the real treat here is the supporting cast. Cooter (David Koechner), Uncle Jessie (Willie Nelson) and Sheev (Kevin Hefferman) provide some of the funniest moments. The movie was directed by Jay Chandrasekhar who also directed ""Super Troopers"", a funny movie in its own right. Love `em or hate `em, the Duke boys are on DVD and for a good time, give this one a spin.A Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack is included as one might imagine, it's very active. Most movies have a car chase scene as their main focus, but ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" is pretty much one big car chase scene. As such all of the channels are vibrant with sound buzzing out of every possible speaker. Dialogue is clean, clear and if you've ever wanted to hear ""Yee Haw"" in 5.1 sound - now's your chance. The soundtrack buzzes with plenty of Lynard Skynnard hamering away in the background. Suffice it to say that Warner delivers again with this soundtrack.""The Dukes of Hazzard"" is shown in a very wide 2.40: 1 aspect ratio that looks great in all of its anamorphic beauty. Being a big budget film and a new to DVD release, I was expecting a good-looking transfer and I'm pleased to say that Warner has delivered. Colors are rich and vibrant and the level of detail is amazing. Most of the scenes take place during the day so there's no risk of any low light areas to compromise the transfer. As the ending credits roll, there's an outtake in which Joe Don Baker says ""Every time I look at her (Jessica Simpson's) tiddies, I forget my line"". Well, the transfer is certainly good enough to make any person watching forget their line...The extras are plentiful, but ultimately lacking in substance; then again this is ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" we're talking about here, so it kind of makes sense. First up, this is the ""Unrated"" version with additional footage not shown in theaters. Not having seen the movie in theaters, I can only guess what was added for this extended cut. There are two sets of additional scenes, a ""PG-13"" version and some ""Unrated"" versions as well. The unrated ones will let you take a peek at some topless sorority girls - I'd advise watching those. There are three featurettes: ""Daisy Dukes: The Short Short Shorts"" in which we see Jessica Simpson and how she got in shape for the part (evidently she had to work out to get her size down to get in the shorts) and even a tutorial on how to make your own. ""The General Lee Lives"" shows us a good portion of footage and how this 1969 Charger has become one of the most famous in the world. ""How to Launch a Muscle Car 175 feet in 4 Seconds"" shows us just that - how they pulled off those jumps. They must have gone through a lot of cars and shows us that the Dukes would have been dead several times over if the stunts were real. There are a couple of gag reels, Jessica Simpson's ""These Boots are Made for Walkin'"" music video and the obiligatory ""Making of..."" featurette. While this movie might not enlighten you like others, break out the moonshine and give this disc a spin.

943936,AV5G37VFE5NVD,B000BKJ74Y,Tom Benton,"[3, 4]","Not surprisingly, ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" bears little resemblance to the classic TV series on which it's based.  Sean William Scott and Johnny Knoxville play cousins Bo and Luke Duke, who lose their brains from the TV show and become crazy young-'uns with raging hormones.  The plot of this film involves Bo and Luke out to stop Boss Hogg (Burt Reynolds) from stripmining Hazzard.  Also, Bo wants to win the Hazzard Racing Tournament for the 4th year, but faces tough competition from Billy Prickett (James Roday).Let me start off by saying that fans of the TV show will no doubt be disappointed.  The characters in this film bear little resemblance to those of the series.  In the last few years, many TV shows have been remade as movies (namely ""Charlie's Angels"" and ""Starsky & Hutch""), and while these remakes may have been entertaining, there's little resemblance to the series that they are based on.  The key to enjoying these films is to seperate them from the TV series.  I did that for ""Dukes of Hazzard"", and I had a great time.The film has a great cast.  Scott is very funny as Bo Duke.  Michael Weston makes a very likable Enos.  Burt Reynolds is enjoyable as Boss Hogg.  Jessica Simpson is actually pretty good as Daisy Duke.  Then we have the great Willie Nelson as Uncle Jessie, who is very funny in many of his scenes.  Lynda Carter has a small part as a friend of the Duke family.The script isn't top-notch, but who'd expect it to be?  For that matter, who'd WANT it to be?  This film can be summed up in three words: simple, silly fun.  The script is fun.  The cast is funny.  There's a great soundtrack, including the classic ""Good Ol' Boys"" theme.  And there's the General Lee.If you're looking for a bright film, this would probably not be a wise choice.

But, while the episodes from the late 1970s and '80s run together in a mental collage of car chases, car wrecks, ""wahoos"" and Catherine Bach's well-tanned legs, I can certainly remember that I, as a young, unsophisticated teenage boy, was entertained.So it was with a certain sick fascination, mixed with groaning resignation, that I decided to give the 2005 movie a try. I really need to resist these impulses.Believe it or not, Hollywood took a TV series with little substance and managed to give it less. At the same time, they pushed every trait of the show's familiar characters and pushed them to an unpleasant extreme. Thus, cousins Bo and Luke Duke are dumber. Cousin Daisy is sluttier. Uncle Jesse is cruder. The bad guys are more rotten, lacking the screwball villain mentality that once made them fun to watch.This film wants us to believe two hicks can walk into numerous bedrooms in a college girls' dorm without knocking and find dozens of cheerfully topless and shameless coeds to play with in each; why bother looking for reason or quality?At least filmmakers had the good sense to realize that driving a car emblazoned with the name General Lee and a Confederate flag into downtown Atlanta is not going to win many friends.by Tom Knapp, Rambles.( n e t ) editor",2,Took a little and made it less,1168128000,"01 7, 2007",2007,1454,"['would', 'be', 'who', 'might', 'say', 'filmmakers', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'work', 'when', 'opted', 'make', 'modern', 'big-screen', 'version', 'hit', 'TV', 'series', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', 'episodes', 'late', '1970s', ""'80s"", 'run', 'together', 'mental', 'collage', 'car', 'chases', 'car', 'wrecks', 'wahoos', 'Catherine', 'Bach', 'well-tanned', 'legs', 'can', 'certainly', 'remember', 'young', 'unsophisticated', 'teenage', 'boy', 'was', 'was', 'certain', 'sick', 'fascination', 'mixed', 'groaning', 'resignation', 'decided', 'give', '2005', 'movie', 'try', 'really', 'need', 'resist', 'impulses.Believe', 'not', 'Hollywood', 'took', 'TV', 'series', 'little', 'substance', 'managed', 'give', 'less', 'same', 'time', 'pushed', 'trait', 'show', 'familiar', 'characters', 'pushed', 'unpleasant', 'extreme', 'Thus', 'cousins', 'Bo', 'Luke', 'Duke', 'are', 'dumber', 'Cousin', 'Daisy', 'sluttier', 'Uncle', 'Jesse', 'cruder', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'more', 'rotten', 'lacking', 'screwball', 'villain', 'mentality', 'once', 'made', 'fun', 'watch.This', 'film', 'believe', 'two', 'hicks', 'can', 'walk', 'numerous', 'bedrooms', 'college', 'girls', 'dorm', 'knocking', 'find', 'dozens', 'cheerfully', 'topless', 'shameless', 'coeds', 'play', 'why', 'bother', 'looking', 'reason', 'quality', 'least', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'good', 'sense', 'realize', 'driving', 'car', 'emblazoned', 'name', 'General', 'Lee', 'Confederate', 'flag', 'downtown', 'Atlanta', 'not', 'going', 'win', 'many', 'friends.by', 'Tom', 'Knapp', 'Rambles', 'n', 'e', 't', 'editor']",N/A

943939,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000BKJ74Y,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 2]","It seems many fans of the original `Dukes of Hazzard' hate this new film version. I never saw the original TV when it was televised in Japan, and have no intention to make any comparison between the two, but still I also could not like the film, and found it very lame and unfunny. Film remake of ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" was pretty unfunny (in a literal meaning), but this one's unfunny' easily surpasses it with more disastrous results.In a nutshell, the film is about Duke cousins and their buffoonery. These `good' boys Bo (Seann William Scott) and Luke (Johnny Knoxville) deliver moonshine manufactured by Uncle Jesse (Willie Nelson looking exactly as Willie Nelson), and stop the schemes of Hogg (Burt Reynolds ... oh dear). The pedestrian story and faceless supports are of no use here, especially when most of the humor of the film belong to those of amateur comedians whose only trick to cry, yell, be offensive, run around, and finally destroy things on stage.You can also see Jessica Simpson who is not required to do much except to look sexy, but if you're interested in her alone, you can save your time by watching her music video ans listen to the uninspired cover version of one Nancy Sinatra hit song.[THE GREATEST THING IS ... THE CAR] But the real hero of the film is the `General Lee' driving wildly on the country road and flying high up in the air occasionally. Unlike the typecast actors, this red car knows how to entertain the viewers with good stunt works. But even the great work from the stunts are undermined by the lengthy story and underwhelming finale. Even `Herbie' and Lindsay Lohan know how to wrap up the film with more decent car race scenes.I know Scott and Knoxville are both better actors than their previous works would suggest. It is true that they and their OK performances are not to be blamed for and confused with the badly stereotyped Southern people and its culture, but still they are responsible for what they choose, and this kind of mistake could kill the career someday.`Dukes of Hazzard' is a forgettable and derivative comedy from the director of `Super Troopers' which I think is overrated, but still better than this.

BUTCHERED! I knew it was going to be bad when I saw the trailer and I heard of who was going to be cast in the movie, but I rented it hoping to be surprised.I like Sean Williams Scott and Burt Reynolds but neither resembles the character that they are playing in the original movie. Johnny Knoxville at least looks mildly like Luke even though he spends more time jumping in and out of bed with the women in this film than he does anything else. I could have a faulty memory but I don't remember that from the TV show. And Sean Williams Scott is practically a-sexual as Bo in this movie, which is SOO not how I remember Bo being. When I was a kid, Bo was one of the primary reasons I watched the Dukes of Hazzard because he was HOT and his character didn't seem like an idiot (which this Bo is).I like Jessica Simpson as a singer, but she doesn't convey the intelligence of the original Daisy Duke. While Daisy was always a sex symbol on the show, I always thought that Daisy was highly intelligent and sometimes I thought she was smarter than Bo and Luke. There is barely a part for Daisy in this film. The only thing she does is skimp around in little outfits to distract people from what the men in her family are doing.Burt Reynolds was sinister in this movie, but not as fat or as funny as Boss Hogg from the show. Boss Hogg's assistant Cletus was completely unlike the TV show character who was hilarious!To me, this movie was a chance to throw together three attractive people, skimpy outfits, pointless boob shots, and some interesting car chases into a movie. I wondered in the back of my mind if the actors and director had even watched the original Dukes of Hazzard. I say if you buy this, buy it because you like these actors or you like the General Lee, don't buy it because you want to re-live the television experience.

I thought Johnny Knoxville did a great job, Seann was a lousy Bo (he came off very dumb and naive), and although Jessica really did do a surprisingly good job as Daisy, I really wish she would have went brunette for the part, to look more like Catherine Bach.

Boe and Luke Duke were Icons.  Yes, the show had them doing amazing stuts in the General Lee, but it was cool.  This movie tried to recapture that feel...and missed so bad.  I didn't mind the casting, but the script had crude humor, and the unrealness of the plot was way beyond what the TV show did.  Even the TV show never had a huge police chase that started in Atlanta and spilled over to Hazzard, and the number of offenses...jeeze. THe TV show at least kept it to the relm that the Dukes were always framed, but here, actually did tons of damage, performed dangerous stunt in urban areas etc.  I liked the backwoods chases etc.  Also, the sexual content just took away from the plot, as well as the moonshine, they never actually ran moonshine in the show, not that i remember. But, it has its funny moments, and the guys from Broken Lizards are to thank for those.  Dissapointing.

943948,A1P6NRWDD1NT4B,B000BKJ74Y,"Yendor ""sknayfan""","[1, 4]","THE DUKES OF HAZZARD was okay and delivered on the grounds of its target audience (Does this target audience still exist?). However, if one remembers the original series, Bo and Luke Duke (John Schneider & Tom Wopat respectively) were not the idiots as portrayed in the film version (played by Seann William Scott & Johnny Knoxville). Bo and Luke in the tv series were usually played straight, intelligent and the ""calm in center of the storm"". They were likeable characters. The movie Daisy Duke and Uncle Jessie (Jessica Simpson and Willie Nelson) are pretty close to their tv counterparts while Boss Hogg (Burt Reynolds) and Sheriff Roscoe P Coltrane (MC Gainey --tv's LOST--one of ""The Others"") are way off from their original tv portraits. Bo/Williams & Luke/Knoxville are irritatingly mean-spirited and unlikeable throughout the film.  Directed by Jay Chandrasekhar of ""Broken Lizard"" (SUPER TROOPERS, BEER FEST), so one can get a good idea on what the atmosphere of this film is going to be like. A few of the ""Broken Lizard"" troop even a appear in the film (and apparently did some of the rewites on the script). The plot revolves around the Duke's farm being taken away from them by Sheriff Roscoe P. Coltrane and Boss Hogg, and the Dukes must get it back. Also, there is a NASCAR race coming to town and the Dukes must get ""The General Lee"" (the famous Dodge Charger) tuned up to win a big race. Overall, there are a few laughs courtesy of the ""Broken Lizard"" influence of the film, Jessica Simpson is a always nice to look at while filling out those ""Daisy-Duke"" shorts just fine, and the classy Linda Carter (tv's WONDER WOMAN) rounds out the cast in a supporting role.",2,Git Them Duke Boys...Geh!
