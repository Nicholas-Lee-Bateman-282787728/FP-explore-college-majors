The closet you'll ever get to High Definition. Like looking through glass. I tried it on an old tv and it made my tv look like new almost. Truley amazing! And most IMAX DVD's include DTS sound.For you widescreen lovers, DO NOT be put-off by the standard format of 1:33:1 that the DVD IS Released it. It is the way the film was shot and on my widescreen the picture is awesome watching it in ANY frame. ""Full"" or ""Wide Zoom"". It even gives you that feeling your at the IMAX theatre and does not take away anything because it is not in widescreen format. The closet thing to High Definition DVD is worth the price alone. You can't go wrong with any IMAX film.Sure some of the IMAX films might not have the greatest stories and might be under an hour long, but in my opinion the picture quality alone is worth the price. It is my opinion that IMAX and it's affiliates are the absolute BEST in DVD digital / picture quality transfer. I have yet to see a beter DVD picture. Also, most IMAX DVD's come with DTS sound.I even purchased the 3-D IMAX box set and was amazed at the amusement park/in your face special effects I got on my widescreen television.

The soundtrack is awesome, the narration by Pierce Brosnan is great, the filming is phenomenal, and most importantly, the subject: Dolphins! As one of the few creatures on Earth (that we know about) that feel emotions similar to how humans feel them, they are fascinating to many, including me. There are some great stories about relationships between Dolphins and humans including a situation where a man was rescued by one from a shark (there are several recorded cases of this, as well as people being saved from drowning).This is a wonderful show for the whole family and I highly recommend it, especially if you have any level of interest in Dolphins.

557594,AY12DBB0U420B,B00004Y2QC,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","Tonight's DVD entertainment was ""Dolphins."" I got it as part of a package of five DVDs in a collection of MacGillivray Freeman Films originally made for showing in IMAX theaters. The DVD was divided into two parts with the first being the feature film ""Dolphins."" After the feature came the second part, ""The Making of The Dolphins."" I found both parts to be equally interesting and, by all means, you should view both preferably in one sitting.Dolphins and closely related marine mammals are, without question, some of the more interesting animals on the earth. It's hard to believe, but this large marine group evolved from on-land mammals and their origins go back to Eocene time 45 to 50 million years ago. The film documents studying and filming of these interesting creatures in their own habitat at a number of localities, mostly along the eastern coastlines and nearby islands of North America (Florida and South), Central America and South America as far south as Argentina. In this first part, the emphasis is on the dolphins, the scientists, the cameramen and supporting crew and their tasks of tracking and filming the dolphins. The second part concentrates more on a lot of the behind-the-scenes activities that went to support such a large undertaking. There's a lot of overlap between the two parts. The first part, in particular, has pleasant  accompanying musical score, at least a part of which is credited to Sting. I enjoyed the music but found it to be somewhat intrusive in places. It was loud enough to make the conversations hard to understand. It's a very minor complaint. The filming was excellent, as you would probably expect, and the underwater photography was just awesome. Altogether, this is a fine documentary-style DVD package and I'll enjoy showing it to my little boy (now 3) when he gets a bit older.It's both an interesting and highly educational DVD.Gary Peterson",5,"Both Interesting and Highly Educational,",1331942400,"03 17, 2012",2012,1902,"['Tonight', 'DVD', 'entertainment', 'was', 'Dolphins', 'got', 'part', 'package', 'five', 'DVDs', 'collection', 'MacGillivray', 'Freeman', 'Films', 'originally', 'made', 'showing', 'IMAX', 'theaters', 'DVD', 'was', 'divided', 'two', 'parts', 'first', 'being', 'feature', 'film', 'Dolphins', 'feature', 'came', 'second', 'part', 'Making', 'Dolphins', 'found', 'parts', 'be', 'equally', 'interesting', 'means', 'should', 'view', 'preferably', 'one', 'sitting.Dolphins', 'closely', 'related', 'marine', 'mammals', 'are', 'question', 'more', 'interesting', 'animals', 'earth', 'hard', 'believe', 'large', 'marine', 'group', 'evolved', 'on-land', 'mammals', 'origins', 'go', 'back', 'Eocene', 'time', '45', '50', 'million', 'years', 'ago', 'film', 'documents', 'studying', 'filming', 'interesting', 'creatures', 'own', 'habitat', 'number', 'localities', 'mostly', 'eastern', 'coastlines', 'nearby', 'islands', 'North', 'America', 'Florida', 'South', 'Central', 'America', 'South', 'America', 'far', 'south', 'Argentina', 'first', 'part', 'emphasis', 'dolphins', 'scientists', 'cameramen', 'supporting', 'crew', 'tasks', 'tracking', 'filming', 'dolphins', 'second', 'part', 'more', 'lot', 'behind-the-scenes', 'activities', 'went', 'support', 'large', 'undertaking', 'lot', 'overlap', 'two', 'parts', 'first', 'part', 'particular', 'pleasant', 'accompanying', 'musical', 'score', 'least', 'part', 'credited', 'Sting', 'enjoyed', 'music', 'found', 'be', 'somewhat', 'intrusive', 'places', 'was', 'loud', 'enough', 'make', 'conversations', 'hard', 'understand', 'very', 'minor', 'complaint', 'filming', 'was', 'excellent', 'would', 'probably', 'expect', 'underwater', 'photography', 'was', 'just', 'awesome', 'Altogether', 'fine', 'documentary-style', 'DVD', 'package', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'showing', 'little', 'boy', 'now', '3', 'when', 'bit', 'older.It', 'interesting', 'highly', 'educational', 'DVD.Gary', 'Peterson']",N/A

557598,AU3GYRAKBUAEU,B00004Y2QC,Jon Norris,"[19, 21]","This is a great production about dolphins. It was shot on 70mm film for Imax theaters and converted to DVD. Needless to say, the footage is stunning (and extremely difficult to shoot). 70mm film captures an incredible image and the overall quality of the footage is outstanding.It is a bit weaker on the content side. Due to the constraints of shooting Imax film, the main feature is not very long (about 40 minutes), and the segments tend to be short as well. Also, this project concentrated more on a scientific angle and emotional appeal than the excellent ""Dolphins - Tribes of the Sea"" DVD. While there is a certain amount of similarity and overlap between these two DVDs, the focus and content are a bit different, and the extra features on this DVD are as good, if not better, than the main feature itself.In my ""Tribes of the Sea"" review I needle this DVD a bit about the female scientist (Kathleen Dudzinski) and her skimpy red swim suit, but that is all in good fun (and I am certainly not complaining!). In all fairness, the footage of Dean Bernal in his skimpy swim suit provides good balance and gender equity. Seriously, though, both sets of footage of these humans swimming with dolphins shows the similarity of grace and motion of our respective body types, and is not at all out of place. In fact, I think it is something that should have been more clearly addressed. This is a highly polished, Hollywood feature production, and one expects that sort of production value in what is basically a promotional piece for our oceans.One of the things that bothered me about this DVD was that it seemed to focus on people more than the dolphins. Not a bad thing if you want to create identification and connection in your audience, but not something I cared much about.The other minor nitpick I had with this DVD was the constant sense of people (scientists) being superior to these ""wild animals,"" and not considering that they are more than just cute, smart, seafaring dogs that need our wise protection. I happen to think they may well be far more intelligent than we, and are certainly far more capable physically than we humans. That shallow, scientific/academic snobbery is something that always rubs me the wrong way, and, for me, taints the way dolphins are portrayed in this production. (It would tickle me no end to find out that it is the other way around, and we end up needing their kindness, compassion, and knowledge to survive. We'll have to wait a bit and see on that one.......) Dean Bernal was refreshingly open about his dolphin pal Jojo and stood out in sharp contrast by thinking of the dolphin more as an equal.The ""Tribes of the Sea"" DVD was much more open in speculating about dolphin culture and intelligence, as well as demonstrating far more strikingly just how incredibly bright they are. It made me feel like the dolphins were being considered as sentient beings equal to ourselves, instead of cute, kind of smart, curiosities to be studied and groomed in aquatic stables. This DVD definitely lost points with me on that score. I'll wager that the reality of the cetacean soul will prove to be far more than scientists can imagine (not that scientists are known for imagination.......or souls).Still, this is a great DVD about dolphins, with great footage and some real human warmth managing to sneak through, especially in the ""Making of"" extra feature (this DVD is worth getting just for the short scene in here of dolphins watching themselves dance underwater in front of a mirror - absolutely wonderful and amazing!). There is also a Windows Media Video version on a separate disc for playing on your computer, and lots of other features and references to more dolphin material (all with the proper scientific slant, of course).If you can only get one dolphin DVD, get ""Tribes of the Sea."" If you can get two, get this one as well. These two together give an outstanding glimpse at the wonderful world of our cetacean brothers and sisters, and should be required viewing on a regular basis.",4,second best dolphin DVD I've seen,1194220800,"11 5, 2007",2007,4034,"['great', 'production', 'dolphins', 'was', 'shot', '70mm', 'film', 'Imax', 'theaters', 'converted', 'DVD', 'Needless', 'say', 'footage', 'stunning', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'shoot', '70mm', 'film', 'captures', 'incredible', 'image', 'overall', 'quality', 'footage', 'outstanding.It', 'bit', 'weaker', 'content', 'side', 'Due', 'constraints', 'shooting', 'Imax', 'film', 'main', 'feature', 'not', 'very', 'long', '40', 'minutes', 'segments', 'tend', 'be', 'short', 'well', 'Also', 'project', 'concentrated', 'more', 'scientific', 'angle', 'emotional', 'appeal', 'excellent', 'Dolphins', 'Tribes', 'Sea', 'DVD', 'certain', 'amount', 'similarity', 'overlap', 'two', 'DVDs', 'focus', 'content', 'are', 'bit', 'different', 'extra', 'features', 'DVD', 'are', 'as', 'good', 'not', 'better', 'main', 'feature', 'itself.In', 'Tribes', 'Sea', 'review', 'needle', 'DVD', 'bit', 'female', 'scientist', 'Kathleen', 'Dudzinski', 'skimpy', 'red', 'swim', 'suit', 'good', 'fun', 'am', 'certainly', 'not', 'complaining', 'fairness', 'footage', 'Dean', 'Bernal', 'skimpy', 'swim', 'suit', 'good', 'balance', 'gender', 'equity', 'Seriously', 'sets', 'footage', 'humans', 'swimming', 'dolphins', 'similarity', 'grace', 'motion', 'respective', 'body', 'types', 'not', 'place', 'fact', 'think', 'something', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'clearly', 'addressed', 'highly', 'polished', 'Hollywood', 'feature', 'production', 'one', 'sort', 'production', 'value', 'what', 'basically', 'promotional', 'piece', 'oceans.One', 'things', 'bothered', 'DVD', 'was', 'seemed', 'focus', 'people', 'more', 'dolphins', 'Not', 'bad', 'thing', 'want', 'create', 'identification', 'connection', 'audience', 'not', 'something', 'cared', 'much', 'other', 'minor', 'nitpick', 'had', 'DVD', 'was', 'constant', 'sense', 'people', 'scientists', 'being', 'superior', 'wild', 'animals', 'not', 'considering', 'are', 'more', 'just', 'cute', 'smart', 'seafaring', 'dogs', 'need', 'wise', 'protection', 'happen', 'think', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'intelligent', 'are', 'certainly', 'far', 'more', 'capable', 'physically', 'humans', 'shallow', 'scientific/academic', 'snobbery', 'something', 'always', 'rubs', 'wrong', 'way', 'way', 'dolphins', 'are', 'portrayed', 'production', 'would', 'tickle', 'end', 'find', 'out', 'other', 'way', 'end', 'up', 'needing', 'kindness', 'compassion', 'knowledge', 'survive', ""'ll"", 'have', 'wait', 'bit', 'see', 'one', 'Dean', 'Bernal', 'was', 'refreshingly', 'open', 'dolphin', 'pal', 'Jojo', 'stood', 'out', 'sharp', 'contrast', 'thinking', 'dolphin', 'more', 'equal.The', 'Tribes', 'Sea', 'DVD', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'open', 'speculating', 'dolphin', 'culture', 'intelligence', 'as', 'well', 'demonstrating', 'far', 'more', 'strikingly', 'just', 'how', 'incredibly', 'are', 'made', 'feel', 'dolphins', 'were', 'being', 'considered', 'sentient', 'beings', 'equal', 'ourselves', 'instead', 'cute', 'kind', 'smart', 'curiosities', 'be', 'studied', 'groomed', 'aquatic', 'stables', 'DVD', 'definitely', 'lost', 'points', 'score', ""'ll"", 'wager', 'reality', 'cetacean', 'soul', 'will', 'prove', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'scientists', 'can', 'imagine', 'not', 'scientists', 'are', 'known', 'imagination', '.or', 'souls', '.Still', 'great', 'DVD', 'dolphins', 'great', 'footage', 'real', 'human', 'warmth', 'managing', 'sneak', 'especially', 'Making', 'extra', 'feature', 'DVD', 'worth', 'getting', 'just', 'short', 'scene', 'here', 'dolphins', 'watching', 'dance', 'underwater', 'front', 'mirror', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'amazing', 'also', 'Windows', 'Media', 'Video', 'version', 'separate', 'disc', 'playing', 'computer', 'lots', 'other', 'features', 'references', 'more', 'dolphin', 'material', 'proper', 'scientific', 'slant', 'course', 'can', 'only', 'get', 'one', 'dolphin', 'DVD', 'get', 'Tribes', 'Sea', 'can', 'get', 'two', 'get', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'two', 'together', 'give', 'outstanding', 'glimpse', 'wonderful', 'world', 'cetacean', 'brothers', 'sisters', 'should', 'be', 'required', 'viewing', 'regular', 'basis']",N/A
