The majority of movies of this type(mockbusters as they're affectionately called) that I've seen lately have been pretty disappointing. Asylum, for the most part, has turned out some pretty entertaining films(Journey to the Center of the Earth, Dragon, the Scarecrow saga, 2-Headed Shark Attack, Sherlock Holmes, H.G. Well's War of the Worlds & War of the Worlds 2: The Next Wave, 6 Guns, Death Valley: The Return of Bloody Bill and Hillside Cannibals..just to name a few, lol). People give Asylum a hard time because most of their movies are, for lack of a better term, knockoffs of movies coming out at a theater near you. Yet, if you'll dig a little deeper in their lineup of movies, you'll find out that they've did alot of original movies as well(and they were good, to boot). Believe me, I've seen far far worse movies from companies that invest good money in their movies. So, to those haters out there, give Asylum a break. Least, they give us entertaining movies with actors & actresses that we know and that's all I want, really.Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies starts off with Lincoln as a little boy having his life forever changed by a run-in(so to speak) with the undead. Fast forward to Civil War times and Lincoln's Presidency, rumors go round that soldiers are returning from the dead. He decides to put together a group to fight against the threat with him leading the charge and that's the gist of the plot mostly.Over all, I thought Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies was a decently fun zombie movie. It's actually one that I've added to my zombie movie collection. Sure, it has its' moments where you can tell it's a B-movie..but it is still a fun one, nonetheless.I applaud Bill Oberst Jr. and Baby Norman's performance in this movie, they were top notch!",4,Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies......,1343347200,"07 27, 2012",2012,1832,"['really', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'vs.', 'Zombies', 'majority', 'movies', 'type', 'mockbusters', ""'re"", 'affectionately', 'called', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lately', 'have', 'been', 'pretty', 'disappointing', 'Asylum', 'most', 'part', 'turned', 'out', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'films', 'Journey', 'Center', 'Earth', 'Dragon', 'Scarecrow', 'saga', '2-Headed', 'Shark', 'Attack', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'H.G', 'Well', 'War', 'Worlds', 'War', 'Worlds', '2', 'Next', 'Wave', '6', 'Guns', 'Death', 'Valley', 'Return', 'Bloody', 'Bill', 'Hillside', 'Cannibals..just', 'name', 'few', 'lol', 'People', 'give', 'Asylum', 'hard', 'time', 'most', 'movies', 'are', 'lack', 'better', 'term', 'knockoffs', 'movies', 'coming', 'out', 'theater', ""'ll"", 'dig', 'little', 'deeper', 'lineup', 'movies', ""'ll"", 'find', 'out', ""'ve"", 'did', 'alot', 'original', 'movies', 'well', 'were', 'good', 'boot', 'Believe', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'far', 'far', 'worse', 'movies', 'companies', 'invest', 'good', 'money', 'movies', 'So', 'haters', 'out', 'there', 'give', 'Asylum', 'break', 'Least', 'give', 'entertaining', 'movies', 'actors', 'actresses', 'know', 'want', 'really.Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'vs.', 'Zombies', 'Lincoln', 'little', 'boy', 'having', 'life', 'forever', 'changed', 'run-in', 'so', 'speak', 'undead', 'Fast', 'forward', 'Civil', 'War', 'times', 'Lincoln', 'Presidency', 'rumors', 'go', 'round', 'soldiers', 'are', 'returning', 'dead', 'put', 'together', 'group', 'fight', 'threat', 'leading', 'charge', 'gist', 'plot', 'thought', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'vs.', 'Zombies', 'was', 'decently', 'fun', 'zombie', 'movie', 'actually', 'one', ""'ve"", 'added', 'zombie', 'movie', 'collection', 'Sure', 'moments', 'where', 'can', 'tell', 'B-movie..but', 'still', 'fun', 'one', 'nonetheless.I', 'applaud', 'Bill', 'Oberst', 'Jr.', 'Baby', 'Norman', 'performance', 'movie', 'were', 'top', 'notch']",Abraham Lincoln vs Zombies

Hill ""CFH""","[0, 0]","""Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies"" is an Asylum attempt to cash in on the big budgetAbraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter [Blu-ray], but it is actually a notch above most Asylum releases. I love zombie movies and am a bit of a Civil War buff as well, so perhaps I was a little more predispositioned to like this than other viewers.No plot spoilers from me: The movie follows the exploits of President Lincoln as he confronts a threat even greater than the on going Civil War. The plot was weak at best but serviceable for a zombie movie and the acting was mostly amateurish, with the notable exception of Bill Oberst Jr. as Abe Lincoln. Oberst actually carried most scenes and made the movie watchable. There were many liberties taken with the placement of famous people and history in general, but that can be forgiven in this movie. The special effects ranged from laughable to fairly good but the repeating, never empty muzzle-loading rifles were almost unforgivable. I actually like the ending and thought it was cleverly handled.This is not a movie that I'll likely go out of my way to see again, but it does work as a campy zombie flick.CFH",3,Bad But Watchable,1343692800,"07 31, 2012",2012,1135,"['Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'vs.', 'Zombies', 'Asylum', 'attempt', 'cash', 'big', 'budgetAbraham', 'Lincoln', 'Vampire', 'Hunter', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'actually', 'notch', 'most', 'Asylum', 'love', 'zombie', 'movies', 'am', 'bit', 'Civil', 'War', 'buff', 'as', 'well', 'perhaps', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'predispositioned', 'other', 'viewers.No', 'plot', 'spoilers', 'movie', 'exploits', 'President', 'Lincoln', 'threat', 'even', 'greater', 'going', 'Civil', 'War', 'plot', 'was', 'weak', 'best', 'serviceable', 'zombie', 'movie', 'acting', 'was', 'mostly', 'amateurish', 'notable', 'exception', 'Bill', 'Oberst', 'Jr.', 'Abe', 'Lincoln', 'Oberst', 'actually', 'carried', 'most', 'scenes', 'made', 'movie', 'watchable', 'were', 'many', 'liberties', 'taken', 'placement', 'famous', 'people', 'history', 'general', 'can', 'be', 'forgiven', 'movie', 'special', 'effects', 'ranged', 'laughable', 'fairly', 'good', 'repeating', 'never', 'empty', 'muzzle-loading', 'rifles', 'were', 'almost', 'unforgivable', 'actually', 'ending', 'thought', 'was', 'cleverly', 'handled.This', 'not', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'go', 'way', 'see', 'again', 'work', 'campy', 'zombie', 'flick.CFH']",Abraham Lincoln vs Zombies

1529273,A1LBGXE29GG1IR,B007BS38LW,"Coffee Addicted Writer's Reviews ""Billy""","[4, 5]","I would have to say Abraham Lincoln has always been my favorite president. As a kid, I read books about him, and I did an oral report on Abe for my 6th grade history class, where we got to dress up like someone historically famous. Years later, I learned through genealogy that Abe is a distant cousin. Now it looks like Hollywood has become interested in him, again, with the upcoming horror flick Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter, and Steven Spielberg's bio Lincoln. In addition, The ASYLUM has released their own horror flick titled Abraham Lincoln VS Zombies, in which they have nicely sent me a complimentary DVD for this review.It seems like zombie tales have been done to death since the success of The Walking Dead, but as I am a zombie and an Abe fan, I was intrigue by the title. The prologue shows that a young Abe had to kill his mother, after she was an infected with a zombie virus, with a sickle. (What a horrible thing to experience at a young age.) Years go by and Abe is now President of the Untied States during the great American Civil War.Abe gets word that there are fallen soldiers returning from the dead at a fort, and having been in a zombie situation before, he immediately take action in fear of a major infestation among the American citizens. Our President is responsible in protecting us from all dangers, even the undead. Thus, Abe puts together a team of his best soldiers, the Secret Service. They find a few survivors including a prostitute whom Abe had a previous relationship with, besides from a few conversations there is not much of a romance here, but one would have to remember that Abe was a loyal married man.With his Secret Service at his side, a few prostitutes, a handful of soldiers (Union and Confederate), and a young boy, Abe takes on the zombie infested fort, mostly by beheading them. Let's just say this is a low-budget movie, with no CGI zombies (except for some head flying scenes) or expensive make-up effects, therefore what we get here is a Night of the Living Dead style zombies - pale makeup, a few blood spots, zombie grunting and slow walking.For history buffs, you will be extremely disappointed as there are several history errors, but this is a zombie movie and we are here to watch zombies. One error that did bother me was the mentioned of the men being the Secret Service, which makes no sense as the legislation for creating the agency was on Abe's desk the night he was assassinated. The Secret Service Division was only used to investigate counterfeiting crimes until 1901 when they were assigned to protect the President.The acting throughout the film is mediocre with mostly unknowns, except for Bill Oberst Jr. who plays Abe. At first glance at him in a top hat, I laughed as I thought he looked nothing like Abe, but after he began talking, I actually believed I was watching our sixteenth President. The actor obviously did a lot of research for the role and impressively took on Abe's spirit, but at the same time adding something new to the character. He stays in character for the entire movie, even during the action scenes where he beheads dozens of zombies with his neat, but deadly sickle.Abraham Lincoln VS. Zombies is never going to win an Oscar with its thin plot and cheap effects, but as a zombie movie lover, I had fun watching it. ASYLUM did extremely well by casting Bill Oberst Jr. as Abe, and the director Richard Schenkman did the best he could on a low budget. The result is that we get a decent old-school zombie flick that any zombie fan should enjoy.",4,A Decent Old-School Zombie Flick,1338854400,"06 5, 2012",2012,3548,"['would', 'have', 'say', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'always', 'been', 'favorite', 'president', 'kid', 'read', 'books', 'did', 'oral', 'report', 'Abe', '6th', 'grade', 'history', 'class', 'where', 'got', 'dress', 'up', 'someone', 'historically', 'famous', 'Years', 'later', 'learned', 'genealogy', 'Abe', 'distant', 'cousin', 'Now', 'Hollywood', 'become', 'interested', 'again', 'upcoming', 'horror', 'flick', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'Vampire', 'Hunter', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'bio', 'Lincoln', 'addition', 'ASYLUM', 'released', 'own', 'horror', 'flick', 'titled', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'VS', 'Zombies', 'have', 'nicely', 'sent', 'complimentary', 'DVD', 'review.It', 'zombie', 'tales', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'death', 'success', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'am', 'zombie', 'Abe', 'fan', 'was', 'intrigue', 'title', 'prologue', 'young', 'Abe', 'had', 'kill', 'mother', 'was', 'infected', 'zombie', 'virus', 'sickle', 'What', 'horrible', 'thing', 'experience', 'young', 'age', 'Years', 'go', 'Abe', 'now', 'President', 'Untied', 'States', 'great', 'American', 'Civil', 'War.Abe', 'word', 'are', 'fallen', 'soldiers', 'returning', 'dead', 'fort', 'having', 'been', 'zombie', 'situation', 'immediately', 'take', 'action', 'fear', 'major', 'infestation', 'American', 'citizens', 'President', 'responsible', 'protecting', 'dangers', 'even', 'undead', 'Thus', 'Abe', 'together', 'team', 'best', 'soldiers', 'Secret', 'Service', 'find', 'few', 'survivors', 'including', 'prostitute', 'whom', 'Abe', 'had', 'previous', 'relationship', 'besides', 'few', 'conversations', 'not', 'much', 'romance', 'here', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'remember', 'Abe', 'was', 'loyal', 'married', 'man.With', 'Secret', 'Service', 'side', 'few', 'prostitutes', 'handful', 'soldiers', 'Union', 'Confederate', 'young', 'boy', 'Abe', 'zombie', 'infested', 'fort', 'mostly', 'beheading', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'low-budget', 'movie', 'CGI', 'zombies', 'head', 'flying', 'scenes', 'expensive', 'make-up', 'effects', 'therefore', 'what', 'get', 'here', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'style', 'zombies', 'pale', 'makeup', 'few', 'blood', 'spots', 'zombie', 'grunting', 'slow', 'walking.For', 'history', 'buffs', 'will', 'be', 'extremely', 'disappointed', 'are', 'several', 'history', 'errors', 'zombie', 'movie', 'are', 'here', 'watch', 'zombies', 'One', 'error', 'did', 'bother', 'was', 'mentioned', 'men', 'being', 'Secret', 'Service', 'sense', 'legislation', 'creating', 'agency', 'was', 'Abe', 'desk', 'night', 'was', 'assassinated', 'Secret', 'Service', 'Division', 'was', 'only', 'used', 'investigate', 'counterfeiting', 'crimes', '1901', 'when', 'were', 'assigned', 'protect', 'President.The', 'acting', 'film', 'mediocre', 'mostly', 'unknowns', 'Bill', 'Oberst', 'Jr.', 'who', 'Abe', 'first', 'glance', 'top', 'hat', 'laughed', 'thought', 'looked', 'nothing', 'Abe', 'began', 'talking', 'actually', 'believed', 'was', 'watching', 'sixteenth', 'President', 'actor', 'obviously', 'did', 'lot', 'research', 'role', 'impressively', 'took', 'Abe', 'spirit', 'same', 'time', 'adding', 'something', 'new', 'character', 'character', 'entire', 'movie', 'even', 'action', 'where', 'dozens', 'zombies', 'neat', 'deadly', 'sickle.Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'VS.', 'Zombies', 'never', 'going', 'win', 'Oscar', 'thin', 'plot', 'cheap', 'effects', 'zombie', 'movie', 'lover', 'had', 'fun', 'watching', 'ASYLUM', 'did', 'extremely', 'well', 'casting', 'Bill', 'Oberst', 'Jr.', 'Abe', 'director', 'Richard', 'Schenkman', 'did', 'best', 'could', 'low', 'budget', 'result', 'get', 'decent', 'old-school', 'zombie', 'flick', 'zombie', 'fan', 'should', 'enjoy']",Abraham Lincoln vs Zombies

But outside of that you get a really fun romp! The writer really nestled this plot into the confines of actual history - meaning that if this ""actually"" happened, history would have played out the way that it did in real life. I mean  the ENDING was AWESOME. Seriously, I was left stunned with its depth and impact. I even feel that if the Asylum knew what kind of a gem they had on their hands, they would have found some kind of way to mess it up on purpose because this movie is a blast.There are lots of cameos from historical figures (the best of which is another future president), Abe killing lots of zombies, and a plot that does a minimum amount of meandering.

1529278,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B007BS38LW,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[4, 6]","ABRAHAM LINCOLN VS. ZOMBIES (Dir. Richard Schenkman, 2012, 97 minutes) is a film that can be deeply appreciated by those of us who were raised on a diet of ancient comics and old movies. While I think the zombie must be the most stupid idea in the world and always refused to watch any zombie film, I was drawn to this because of Abraham Lincoln. I LOVE THIS FILM, AND SO WILL YOU.President Abraham Lincoln (a brilliant Bill Oberst, who IS this man who looks like a happy marriage between Harvey Keitel and J&uuml;rgen Prochnow, whose biggest appearances have been as 'the poacher' on ""Lost Tapes""??) receives word about a soldier at Fort Pulaski who has become a zombie. No one else in the world except Lincoln knows about zombies - and an artful, moving backstory explains his childhood run-in with them. As he explains, no one knows how it happened or what it means. He tells Secretary Edwin Stanton (a well cast Bernie Ask) that a special detachment of Secret Service men must go to the fort to handle the problem. Lincoln, of course, will lead them himself since he is the expert.I can't fathom the mixed reviews aside from the fact that this is regarded as a B movie. I'm informed that the folks who made this are specialists at robbing big-time film stories and cranking them out straight-to-DVD before the original films get to theaters (in this case, ABRAHAM LINCOLN VAMPIRE HUNTER). Well if so, they done good. As silly as I am about to sound: this film is Shakespearian, operatic, emotional and very deep. I doubt most of the audience caught that depth.The haunting, genius-level soundtrack (by Chris Ridenhour) and Oberst's portrayal of Lincoln cinched the deal. Lincoln might have come off as a joke; instead, he is as I always imagined him. He is gentle, wise and kind, but he's tough as nails and frankly quite the ""bad-ass"". His folding sickle is a sight to see (he knows zombies must be beheaded) and I'd kill to have one of those scythes myself. Lincoln looks like the angel of death wielding it, which is ironic. Most impressive was the black S.S. man, Wilson Brown (Jason Hughley whom I have seen before). He explains what zombies are - providing everyone with the correct African term of course - and I was very moved by the parallels drawn between zombieism, illness, the Civil War casualties and slavery.The only real weaknesses in this movie seem to be a lack of funds and a hurried production. No flaw made itself apparent to me in the acting (some of it was clearly 'first-take-take-it-as-it-is'), the art, the detail or the dialogue. Naturally I hate the looping (we call it 'pick up' but it is plain old dubbing) but I guess on location and on a shoestring this is the best we can expect to hear. The fantastic soundtrack made up for it and I can't think of another film in which that is the case.The ending, which I will in no way spoil, is so moving and logical it will make you think even more. This movie counts among the most fun I have ever had watching a movie. Filmed on location in Savannah, Georgia, which in itself is a breath of fresh American air, this film cannot fail to draw you in, make you laugh and make you ponder things deeply. It is no mere zombie film and not just a 'popcorn' B movie. In my humble and experienced opinion, it is a cult classic masterpiece.This makes me wonder whether VAMPIRE HUNTER will live up to it, and to itself.If it is history you want, I suggest the following:Young Mr. Lincoln: The (The Criterion Collection)- see my review;Sandburg's Lincoln;Gore Vidal's Lincoln- see my review and beware, the DVD cover art does not show Sam Waterston's face! ...... and the upcoming Steven Spielberg film LINCOLN in theaters this December (2012).What next? GROVER CLEVELAND'S WILD WEEKEND?It took some meditation later on, because I liked this compelling film and had so much fun - I missed the powerful political message. This shows the forces of democracy, freedom and progressive thinking - embodied by President Abraham Lincoln as always - versus the fascist, anti-intellectual, anti-education Tea Party on the right, embodied by the zombies. This is some heavy symbolism, folks, and you just have to watch the movie to get what I mean. It's doubtful Tim Burton's ABRAHAM LINCOLN VAMPIRE HUNTER will live up to this masterful accomplishment.",5,Commander-in-Chief indeed!!,1339632000,"06 14, 2012",2012,4309,"['ABRAHAM', 'LINCOLN', 'VS.', 'ZOMBIES', 'Dir', 'Richard', 'Schenkman', '2012', '97', 'minutes', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'deeply', 'appreciated', 'who', 'were', 'raised', 'diet', 'ancient', 'comics', 'old', 'movies', 'think', 'zombie', 'must', 'be', 'most', 'stupid', 'idea', 'world', 'always', 'refused', 'watch', 'zombie', 'film', 'was', 'drawn', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'LOVE', 'THIS', 'FILM', 'AND', 'SO', 'WILL', 'YOU.President', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'brilliant', 'Bill', 'Oberst', 'who', 'man', 'who', 'happy', 'marriage', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'J', 'uuml', 'rgen', 'Prochnow', 'biggest', 'appearances', 'have', 'been', ""'the"", 'poacher', 'Lost', 'Tapes', 'word', 'soldier', 'Fort', 'Pulaski', 'who', 'become', 'zombie', 'one', 'else', 'world', 'Lincoln', 'zombies', 'artful', 'moving', 'backstory', 'childhood', 'run-in', 'one', 'how', 'happened', 'what', 'Secretary', 'Edwin', 'Stanton', 'well', 'cast', 'Bernie', 'Ask', 'special', 'detachment', 'Secret', 'Service', 'men', 'must', 'go', 'fort', 'handle', 'problem', 'Lincoln', 'course', 'will', 'lead', 'expert.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fathom', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'aside', 'fact', 'regarded', 'B', 'movie', ""'m"", 'informed', 'folks', 'who', 'made', 'are', 'specialists', 'robbing', 'big-time', 'film', 'stories', 'cranking', 'out', 'straight-to-DVD', 'original', 'films', 'get', 'theaters', 'case', 'ABRAHAM', 'LINCOLN', 'VAMPIRE', 'HUNTER', 'Well', 'so', 'done', 'good', 'As', 'silly', 'am', 'sound', 'film', 'Shakespearian', 'operatic', 'emotional', 'very', 'deep', 'doubt', 'most', 'audience', 'caught', 'depth.The', 'haunting', 'genius-level', 'soundtrack', 'Chris', 'Ridenhour', 'Oberst', 'portrayal', 'Lincoln', 'cinched', 'deal', 'Lincoln', 'might', 'have', 'come', 'off', 'joke', 'instead', 'always', 'imagined', 'gentle', 'wise', 'kind', 'tough', 'nails', 'frankly', 'quite', 'bad-ass', 'folding', 'sickle', 'sight', 'see', 'zombies', 'must', 'be', 'beheaded', ""'d"", 'kill', 'have', 'one', 'scythes', 'Lincoln', 'angel', 'death', 'wielding', 'ironic', 'Most', 'impressive', 'was', 'black', 'S.S.', 'man', 'Wilson', 'Brown', 'Jason', 'Hughley', 'whom', 'have', 'seen', 'what', 'zombies', 'are', 'providing', 'everyone', 'correct', 'African', 'term', 'course', 'was', 'very', 'moved', 'parallels', 'drawn', 'zombieism', 'illness', 'Civil', 'War', 'casualties', 'only', 'real', 'weaknesses', 'movie', 'seem', 'be', 'lack', 'funds', 'hurried', 'production', 'flaw', 'made', 'apparent', 'acting', 'was', 'clearly', ""'first-take-take-it-as-it-is"", 'art', 'detail', 'dialogue', 'Naturally', 'hate', 'looping', 'call', 'up', 'plain', 'old', 'dubbing', 'guess', 'location', 'shoestring', 'best', 'can', 'expect', 'hear', 'fantastic', 'soundtrack', 'made', 'up', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'case.The', 'ending', 'will', 'way', 'spoil', 'so', 'moving', 'logical', 'will', 'make', 'think', 'even', 'more', 'movie', 'most', 'fun', 'have', 'ever', 'had', 'watching', 'movie', 'Filmed', 'location', 'Savannah', 'Georgia', 'breath', 'fresh', 'American', 'air', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'fail', 'draw', 'make', 'laugh', 'make', 'ponder', 'things', 'deeply', 'mere', 'zombie', 'film', 'not', 'just', ""'popcorn"", 'B', 'movie', 'humble', 'experienced', 'opinion', 'cult', 'classic', 'masterpiece.This', 'wonder', 'VAMPIRE', 'HUNTER', 'will', 'live', 'up', 'itself.If', 'history', 'want', 'suggest', 'following', 'Young', 'Mr.', 'Lincoln', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'see', 'review', 'Sandburg', 'Lincoln', 'Gore', 'Vidal', 'Lincoln-', 'see', 'review', 'beware', 'DVD', 'cover', 'art', 'not', 'show', 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'face', 'upcoming', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'film', 'LINCOLN', 'theaters', 'December', '2012', 'next', 'GROVER', 'CLEVELAND', 'WILD', 'WEEKEND', 'took', 'meditation', 'later', 'liked', 'compelling', 'film', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'missed', 'powerful', 'political', 'message', 'forces', 'democracy', 'freedom', 'progressive', 'thinking', 'embodied', 'President', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'always', 'fascist', 'anti-intellectual', 'anti-education', 'Tea', 'Party', 'right', 'embodied', 'zombies', 'heavy', 'symbolism', 'folks', 'just', 'have', 'watch', 'movie', 'get', 'what', 'mean', 'doubtful', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'ABRAHAM', 'LINCOLN', 'VAMPIRE', 'HUNTER', 'will', 'live', 'up', 'masterful', 'accomplishment']",Abraham Lincoln vs Zombies

When last I left you we were discussing Mr. Lincoln's vampire hunting, glad you came back for more. Now children listen to the tales of one president's zombie woes and how he dealt with that. I know what you are thinking, ""I can believe he did battle with blood sucking creatures of the night but zombies, come on"". Well I assure you young ones this is just as true as the last.Lucky for us The Asylum [who only puts out quality true life stuff] was able to bring us this very true Biopic. You see Honest Abe is out ridding the world of the zombie menace that was plaguing our nation at the time. He would come across many other historical figures during this crusade. Such names as General Stonewall Jackson, Pat Garrett, and Theodore Roosevelt just to name a few, even Booth is in on the zombie killing. In fact the historical murder of Abe may have more to it, something that may have needed to be done to save us all..This is one of those movies in which you cannot be serious at all. If you go into this with that attitude then you will be highly disappointed. Well maybe not because this is a super fun movie full of all kinds of surprises. The historical figures that make appearances add to the fun and of course there are zombies. But the biggest and best surprise is the lead actor who plays Honest Abe in this honest film. Bill Oberst Jr is amazing in the lead role of the famous President. I was honestly very pleased and surprised by how good he was here. He plays it serious enough to be believable but loose enough to fit the situation of the film.I really liked the way this film showcased our history during this time and how all the historical figures interacted with each other in this time. Sure prior to this true story you learned that none of this ever happened. But why do you think the military has a plan for the Zombie Apocalypse, because our country has already dealt with it before. When it comes around once more will whoever is in office be man enough to hit the front lines like Abe did? I am not sure but I would like to think that whoever that may be that they will, for they are an American, and the American leader at that.

It is kind of like someone finding out that you wanted a cordless drill for a very long time, but had no idea they might get one.

You take out the drill, surprised and happy, having thought you would never get one. This drill, however, only holds a charge for 5 minutes. It doesn't have enough power to even drill a screw a 1/32 inch screw into a soft piece of wood, and the grip breaks in your hand. Then, a few days later you get your expensive drill.

Harris ""Film aficionado""","[29, 31]","4 stars for Asylum Fans2 1/2 stars: Everyone ElseJust one week after releasing their ""Battleship"" clone (American Warships after legally being challenged on the title American Battleship by Universal Studios), Asylum churns out its second mockbuster of the season with ""Abraham Lincoln vs Zombies.""  As the big budget, high concept ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" gets ready to hit a theater near you--the brain trust at Asylum are hoping you'll be craving an earlier peak at monster mayhem with our folksy President.  I never expect much from an Asylum film, most are shot in a few days with a couple of nickels as the budget. But sometimes bad movie magic strikes. Some of the endeavors have been brilliantly bad (I mean that as a compliment) while others have just been bad bad.  Expecting very little from ""Abraham Lincoln vs Zombies,"" I was actually pleasantly surprised.  It's not a great movie and lacks requisite chills (it plays more to action conventions than to scary movie ones), but it does have its charms.After a set-up in which little Abe Lincoln has his life upended by a very personal undead menace, the movie fast forwards to his Presidency.  Amidst the havoc of the Civil War, rumors of soldiers returning from the dead start to circulate.  Abe (played by Bill Oberst Jr.) recognizes the threat from his boyhood experiences and assembles a crackerjack unit of men to infiltrate enemy lines and combat a zombie menace.  Most of the action takes place in a fort as our band of heroes fight for their lives.  There is nothing particularly exciting about this meager plot, the zombies are rather silly looking, and every effect is done with cheap CGI.  It never approaches anything scary, just relentless.  But if you are a frequent admirer of Asylum films, none of this should come as a surprise.What I did like, however, is that the movie manages to fit a lot of historical figures into the screenplay.  It's kind of a clever skewed history lesson as real figures fit into ridiculous scenarios.  But, by far, what distinguishes ""Abraham Lincoln vs Zombies"" is a surprisingly effective performance by Bill Oberst Jr.  Balancing the nobility of a great man with the heroic swagger of an action star, he is a campy delight.  If not for Oberst, I'd have ranked this at least a star lower--but I have to give credit where credit is due.

The plot in a nutshell: Abe's got himself a score to settle with the zombies after one of them kills his mom when he was a kid. Now that he's the President, and the scourge has appeared again, he's determined to wipe them out. But first, he's got to convince the keepers of a Confederate fort that he's not there to kill THEM, but the zombies that seemed to have begun popping up everywhere. It was more amusing than scary --- Lincoln's got himself a fold-up scythe and he knows how to use it! There wasn't much in the way of action, but when there's action, it's pretty good. I did like the use of some other historical characters and got a chuckle out of Teddy Roosevelt (who's a kid), but Lincoln was played well by Bill Oberst, Jr., who totally rocked the stovepipe hat.

Quite often in Hollyweed a script gets passed around to all the studios, they want to make it, but creative directions and what not don't go right, and the company end up making their own version that they hope will out do the other one they didn't get to make.Usually these kind of movies don't even compete, one is just WAY worse than the other... take Death Race and compare it to the cheaper budget one starring the Insane Clown Pussys ...err... I forget the name of theirs, which is a good thing, probably has &#34;Death&#34; in the title... Death Racers? something like that.However, with that being said, this film here is not all that bad. This movie you could almost tie in as a sequel in some ways, stick it in as something else that happened after Abe defeats the Vampires, and it could almost tie in nicely.This time around, I mean, this versions plot see's Abe Lincoln witness his mother turned into a zombie and he has to kill her himself as a child. It then skips to the Cival War where reports have come back to the whitehouse that zombies have taken over a fort. Abe decides he personally must see to it that they are all taken out, and puts together a team of secret service agents to aid him in tracking them and hunting them down. Along the was he makes friends with the South's army, and finds a couple of whores who he had a thing with years before he became prez. Sounds stupid, I know... but so did Abe vs Vampires didn't it? There is also a childhood Teddy Roosevelt who helps Abe's slayings, and John Wilkens Booth is part of his secret service men!!!Hey, if I described the plot of &#34;Bubba HoTep&#34; to you, would you have thought that movie sounds so bizarre it couldn't be any good?

It's a historical piece that focuses upon the American Civil War and guess what? There is a zombie outbreak and President Lincoln himself (Bill Oberst Jr) decides to handle it with a few trusted men. So what if he could use an army? So what if its in the heart of the Confederacy? So what if Lincoln might die? As stated in the picture he can't send someone to do it if he wouldn't do it. Yeah, that makes total sense especially if I drink a few glasses of wine and then some, brah.Sometimes the proper historical references surprise me like when one of Lincoln's competitors, Douglas, is mentioned by one of the lieutenants. There really was a Fortress Pulaski near Savannah Georgia but why Lincoln would sneak with a few of his people down there to stop the zombie epidemic doesn't make much sense. And General Jackson was too important to be guarding a fortress. They should have stated he was visiting a dear friend who was dying and was on leave or something. That would have made some sense.Future President Teddy Roosevelt makes an appearance as a child but that is probably off, too, as he was born in 1858 and the war started in 1861 and ended in 1865. So at best he was seven years old yet this kid seemed closer to 12 or higher. Ah well, I have to remember this was a direct to video riding on the coat tails of ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter"".The dialogue is poorly presented at times and sometimes feels too modern or just plain cheesy. At other times it's nicely presented. I almost wonder if they had different people doing different pieces of the dialogue.Lincoln praying to God by the piano felt right and made me forgive some of their blunders. And, this is at its heart a zombie movie and an excuse to kill zombies and Lincoln with a sickle has a nice look to it. For a mockbuster Oberst does a commendable enough job playing a heroic Lincoln. Now I'm curious to see what this film based itself upon ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter"".Nice soundtrack for the period even if it fails in certain scenes to match the mood.In the tradition of The Asylum's catalog, the film is a mockbuster of the 20th Century Fox film Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. As the budget for this was only $150,000 I'm pretty sure it will make its money back and I'm grading it on a mockbuster scale.

1529296,A20DRRKAN5Z9Q,B007BS38LW,Moviedude,"[0, 0]","Proving that they are not immune to meta-textual irony, the Asylum brings us a mockbuster based on Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, a film itself so niche in appeal we have to wonder if any fans would be fooled. Still, when you are making a movie with zero budget, historical films and zombie movies are the way to go, so this one ends up being pretty okay. A surprisingly heavy script and some good plot twists also elevate this from mockbuster to almost the quality of a promising first student film (but it's not).These direct-to-video sci fi films tend to follow a pretty predictable formula, so I'll break this review down into its constituent parts:Lone Token Celebrity:Bill Oberst Jr. He's done all sorts of television. You may not know the name but when you see him you will be all ""oh, THAT Bill Oberst Jr."" And he does a pretty good job as Abraham Lincoln, and at killing zombies, so no complaints.Lesson About Man's Hubris:Not much. The zombies in this movie are just kind of there. If anything, it's a movie about altruistic zombie slaughter as the authority figure risks life and limb to stop the undead plague. All in all, a solid subversion of tropes.Carnage:For an asylum film the zombie mayhem is pretty well done. Again, no complaints.Awful Effects:Except for squibs the only effects are a couple zombie decapitations, which are not awful at all, actually.Romantic Subplot:SPOILERS!!!!Mary Todd didn't go insane, she was bitten by zombies and became a zombie. Lincoln spent all his spare time caring for her, but eventually he was bitten and rather than become a zombie himself and damage the office of president he deliberately exposes himself to John Wilkes Boothe, who he knows from adventuring together is actually a Confederate spy. This plot twist is probably the movie's most effective part and is actually a much more satisfying conclusion than Vampire Hunter had, IMO.Big Action Truck:There were no trucks in the civil war.

It loses energy after the initial setup and just sort of drifts through its runtime after that.The lead (Bill Oberst, Jr.) playing Abe does a consistently great job through-out the film.  Other than that, the acting wasn't too bad, though the dialog didn't seem that well put together.  Perhaps parts got edited out?For a zombie movie, the zombies are lacking.  The zombies in this film are the slow variant, not the recent action film tread of making them fleet.  This means that they have time and numbers to their advantage.  Neither of which is used.At the beginning the zombies are actively looking for people to chew on.  However, around mid-way through, they're mainly 'sleeping'.  Loud noises or contact is needed to 'wake' them.  This almost makes the zombies harmless, as they have to be disturbed to be a threat.  This leaves just a herd of them standing around out front doing wandering around randomly.  I wanted to see zombies pounding on the gates trying to get in.One of the initial zombies bursts its bonds to start rampaging.  After that the captured zombies don't seem to be interested I getting free.  Zombies when presented with some humans should be struggling to get at them, they just aren't zombies if they don't.This leaves the people in the fort entirely safe as long as they don't leave the fort.  But... periodically someone leaves the fort, and they invariably manage to wake a bunch of zombies up.  Most of the people getting bitten have fallen down for some reason or another, or just aren't paying attention.  Really... how does a zombie sneak up on someone???  They're generally moaning, and shuffling along, nothing surprising there.Overall the zombies aren't scary, and there just doesn't seem to be any urgency for the protagonists to do anything.  They could have sat around there for months.  It would have made more sense to get help, but that would have made it even less exciting than it was...BTW: What's with the one handed scythe?

Even Arthur Andersen can't make that one come out smelling like roses. I haven't seen AL:VH, and I'm not likely to, as I am not a big fan of Seth Grahame-Smith's. But after Bill Oberst kindly responded to my defense of his acting in the previous Asylum movie he acted in, A Haunting in Salem, I figured I'd give Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies a go, since Oberst had the lead role in it. And I have a lot of the same things to say about ALv.Z that I had to say about A Haunting in Salem, though the mix is slightly different.Plot: Honest Abe, played as a child by Run's Brennen Harper, is forced to take up a scythe and help defend the family homestead from an outbreak of the living dead, which among others claims both of his parents. Fast-forward to the Civil War, Abe, now played as an adult by Oberst, is the President, the battle of Gettysburg has just flown by, and he is struggling to come up with some inspirational words to say on the battlefield when dedicating a monument to the turning point of the war. Meanwhile, a covert operation to take and hold a fort just off the Georgia coast has gone horribly wrong, with only one survivor returned, sick and delirious. When Lincoln interviews the man, he knows immediate;y what he's dealing with, and he commands his secretary of state to loan him twelve newly-minted Secret Service agents to travel to Georgia with him and eradicate another outbreak of the living dead. Needless to say, Lincoln and his men not only have to deal with the living dead, but Johnny Reb as well, in the form of Pat Garrett (The Escapist's Christopher Marrone) and Gen. Stonewall Jackson (Coma's Don McGraw) himself, among others...Simply put: I have never had as much fun with an Asylum mockbuster. Hell, I haven't had as much fun with an Asylum movie of any stripe since Stuart Gordon's King of the Ants a decade ago. Which is not to say it's a great movie--the script, while clever at times (adapted by director Schenkman from a story by Karl T. Hirsch and J. Lauren Proctor, two people who obviously know at least a decent amount about Lincoln, enough to make the revisionist history bits quite amusing), tends to overreach, the romance subplot is jaw-droppingly silly, Schenkman's direction given no indication he's learned anything since his early days directing softcore fluff for the Playboy Channel. But even a stopped clock is right twice a day. The Asylum's long-held tradition of casting actors with few-if-any credits, presumably in order to save money, often leads to whole casts of people who simply can't act, while this time around they caught themselves a net full of certified yellowtail; there are a lot of those one-credit actors who hold their own when up against the much more experienced Oberst, and even the overactors (you can tell every time he's onscreen Don McGraw is gearing up to chew as much scenery as possible) seem to be kept in check pretty well. The revisionist history bits are a hoot (for example, The Odd Life of Timothy Green's Cannon Kuipers pops up as a young Teddy Roosevelt, trapped by the living dead in Savannah but eager to fight, who ends up being one of Lincoln's most valuable assets when the feces hits the fan), the jokes are actually kind of funny now and again. I'm not sure I'd believe myself had I not seen it with my own two eyes, but Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies is stupid fun of a type I thought The Asylum had forgotten how to do a decade ago.

1529313,A3DV7AKNM4N8TN,B007BS38LW,Stuart Conover,"[0, 0]","When The Asylum puts out a film 90% of the time you can expect one main thing - there is a major motion picture coming out that they are going to be making fun of. Sure this isn't the case of all of their services, just most of them. This film written and directed by Richard Schenkman is no different as it hit the straight to DVD section of your local movie stores and Amazon. What Richard put together though does strongly go against what The Asylum usually puts out. What I mean to say is that Richard's put together a movie that doesn't suck. Is ALVZ the pinnacle of zombie films? By no means is it even close. However unlike the majority of The Asylum films that are out there it doesn't suck.Bill Oberst Jr. plays the roll of Abraham Lincoln and does such an outstanding performance that there are times you will even forget who produced the film you are watching. It just goes to show you that a decently written and directed film with a great actor goes along way. I'll stop with ripping on The Asylum's films now (as hard as it is) because this really was an enjoyable watch.The pacing of the film is done nearly perfectly. No parts ever seem to really drag aside from a short area near the beginning and the plot advancements that could have turned the film boring or cheesy worked perfectly.The rough outline though shows that Lincoln had to deal with a zombie outbreak as a young boy. It ended almost before it began though the memories lasted a lifetime. Years later when getting ready to deliver the Gettysburg Address there is a report that came in about a plague that highly resembled the outbreak Lincoln knew as a child. Once the messenger who had been bitten turns he knows that he had to keep it a secret and deal with the plague himself. This is the only part of the film that almost seems to drag without any zombies and suffering from a slow setup. Once it passes though it goes to an above average B zombie film that you'll love watching hordes of northern and southern zombies be slayed.The rest of the cast doesn't live up to Bill Oberst Jr.'s amazing take on Lincoln (I really want to see this guy do more films) but are still to pull of an amazing zombie period piece. It's extremely entertaining on how they work in some great historical characters including Pat Garrett (whose actually Billy the Kid), an interesting 10 year old Teddy Roosevelt, and a certain ""John Wilkinson"" (aka Mr. John Wilkes Booth) who, in this version, isn't the villain history has painted him to be.It's a fun film. It by no means won't win any awards but damn do they do a great job at making a mockumentary for the first time in The Asylum's history. Dammit I did it again. Still though if you are looking for a zombie film that isn't horrible (again it's not the best film out there but it's by no means bad and most importantly it's a fun different take on the zombie genre.)",3,Seriously ignore that its a film by The Asylum... they finally put out a decent film!,1349049600,"10 1, 2012",2012,2886,"['When', 'Asylum', 'out', 'film', '90', '%', 'time', 'can', 'expect', 'one', 'main', 'thing', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'coming', 'out', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'making', 'fun', 'Sure', ""n't"", 'case', 'services', 'just', 'most', 'film', 'written', 'directed', 'Richard', 'Schenkman', 'different', 'hit', 'straight', 'DVD', 'section', 'local', 'movie', 'stores', 'Amazon', 'What', 'Richard', 'put', 'together', 'strongly', 'go', 'what', 'Asylum', 'usually', 'out', 'What', 'mean', 'say', 'Richard', 'put', 'together', 'movie', ""n't"", 'suck', 'ALVZ', 'pinnacle', 'zombie', 'films', 'means', 'even', 'close', 'However', 'majority', 'Asylum', 'films', 'are', ""n't"", 'suck.Bill', 'Oberst', 'Jr.', 'roll', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'are', 'times', 'will', 'even', 'forget', 'who', 'produced', 'film', 'are', 'watching', 'just', 'show', 'decently', 'written', 'directed', 'film', 'great', 'actor', 'along', 'way', ""'ll"", 'stop', 'ripping', 'Asylum', 'films', 'now', 'as', 'hard', 'really', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'watch.The', 'pacing', 'film', 'done', 'nearly', 'perfectly', 'parts', 'ever', 'seem', 'really', 'drag', 'aside', 'short', 'area', 'beginning', 'plot', 'advancements', 'could', 'have', 'turned', 'film', 'boring', 'cheesy', 'worked', 'perfectly.The', 'rough', 'outline', 'shows', 'Lincoln', 'had', 'deal', 'zombie', 'outbreak', 'young', 'boy', 'ended', 'almost', 'began', 'memories', 'lasted', 'lifetime', 'Years', 'later', 'when', 'getting', 'ready', 'deliver', 'Gettysburg', 'Address', 'report', 'came', 'plague', 'highly', 'resembled', 'outbreak', 'Lincoln', 'knew', 'child', 'messenger', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'bitten', 'had', 'keep', 'secret', 'deal', 'plague', 'only', 'part', 'film', 'almost', 'drag', 'zombies', 'suffering', 'slow', 'setup', 'above', 'average', 'B', 'zombie', 'film', ""'ll"", 'love', 'watching', 'hordes', 'northern', 'southern', 'zombies', 'be', 'slayed.The', 'rest', 'cast', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'Bill', 'Oberst', 'Jr.', 'amazing', 'take', 'Lincoln', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'guy', 'do', 'more', 'films', 'are', 'still', 'pull', 'amazing', 'zombie', 'period', 'piece', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'how', 'work', 'great', 'historical', 'characters', 'including', 'Pat', 'Garrett', 'actually', 'Billy', 'Kid', 'interesting', '10', 'year', 'old', 'Teddy', 'Roosevelt', 'certain', 'John', 'Wilkinson', 'Mr.', 'John', 'Wilkes', 'Booth', 'who', 'version', ""n't"", 'villain', 'history', 'painted', 'be.It', 'fun', 'film', 'means', 'wo', ""n't"", 'win', 'awards', 'damn', 'do', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'making', 'mockumentary', 'first', 'time', 'Asylum', 'history', 'Dammit', 'did', 'again', 'Still', 'are', 'looking', 'zombie', 'film', ""n't"", 'horrible', 'again', 'not', 'best', 'film', 'there', 'means', 'bad', 'most', 'importantly', 'fun', 'different', 'take', 'zombie', 'genre']",Abraham Lincoln vs Zombies

I ended up a little disappointed, though I'm not sure what would have made it a better fit.  Bill Oberst Jr. takes on the role of the 16th president, and, as some others have noted, he does a fantastic job with it.  This has to be one of the most under-rated actors you've never heard of, expecially seeing how he handles presidential here and then can switch to the psychotic priest ofNude Nuns with Big Guns.  Most of the other actors are competent, even given the strain of acting in the style of the period.  Not all of them though.  A few sound as if they are working in a re-enactment piece for a high-school history class.  Still, the acting was above average, especially for an Asylum movie.And once the fact of the zombie infestation was established, the script was pretty linear.  It didn't have a lot of the silly, obvious plot holes a lot of these Asylum movies have.  Not that it isn't pretty silly overall, but what are you expecting?  Silly is what you should be hoping for with a title like that.So Abe, due to a previous experience with the zombie affliction from when he was a youngster, sees that he is the perfect man to lead a small group of men hand-selected from the newly minted Secret Service when reports begin to come from Fort Pulaski of re-animated Confederate dead.  This fort is especially important strategically for the success of the Union blockade of the South, but once the President hears of the nature of the disease, he quickly realizes that all other differences must be put aside to combat this 'zombie' menace.There are two thumbnail images attached to this movie here on Amazon.  The one that is attached to the regular DVD show a towering Lincoln with a scythe hanging at the ready.  The other, with the blu-ray, has a Lincoln mid-leap, war-face on, scythe drawn back for a tremendous slash.  The first probably fits the tone of the movie better; I wish it had been the other way around.  Yes, this film avoids some risks by playing it straight, but it seems to me that an opportunity like this comes around very seldom, a chance to make something really offbeat.  I can hear you now 'isn't Abraham Lincoln vs Zombies offbeat enough?'No, not really, and that's my point, and why I think I was a little disappointed in the film.  It's not a bad zombie flick, but really, what's the point of dragging in all this historical baggage if you're not going to use much of it?  Once you get past the weirdness of Abraham Lincoln as a zombie killer, the rest of it is pretty straightforward.  Instead of a genre-busting moment, we get a novelty within the zombie pantheon.  It's not a bad novelty, but it never reaches that totally bizarre level that I'm always looking for in B-movies of this type.In the end, if you are a zombie movie fan, you should probably check this out, even though most of the effects are on the level of2012 Zombie Apocalypse, which was also done by Asylum.  Extreme gore fans will likely be disappointed, as well as anyone looking for some extra special bizzare-ness to spice up their Friday Night dinner and a movie.",3,Walk softly and carry a big stick,1339804800,"06 16, 2012",2012,3142,"['think', 'expectations', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'high', 'film', 'ended', 'up', 'little', 'disappointed', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'better', 'fit', 'Bill', 'Oberst', 'Jr.', 'role', '16th', 'president', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'fantastic', 'job', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'under-rated', 'actors', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'expecially', 'seeing', 'how', 'presidential', 'here', 'then', 'can', 'switch', 'psychotic', 'priest', 'ofNude', 'Nuns', 'Big', 'Guns', 'Most', 'other', 'actors', 'are', 'competent', 'even', 'given', 'strain', 'acting', 'style', 'period', 'Not', 'few', 'sound', 'are', 'working', 're-enactment', 'piece', 'high-school', 'history', 'class', 'Still', 'acting', 'was', 'above', 'average', 'especially', 'Asylum', 'movie.And', 'once', 'fact', 'zombie', 'infestation', 'was', 'established', 'script', 'was', 'pretty', 'linear', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'silly', 'obvious', 'plot', 'lot', 'Asylum', 'movies', 'have', 'Not', ""n't"", 'pretty', 'silly', 'overall', 'what', 'are', 'expecting', 'Silly', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'hoping', 'title', 'that.So', 'Abe', 'due', 'previous', 'experience', 'zombie', 'affliction', 'when', 'was', 'youngster', 'perfect', 'man', 'lead', 'small', 'group', 'men', 'hand-selected', 'newly', 'minted', 'Secret', 'Service', 'when', 'reports', 'begin', 'come', 'Fort', 'Pulaski', 're-animated', 'Confederate', 'dead', 'fort', 'especially', 'important', 'strategically', 'success', 'Union', 'blockade', 'South', 'once', 'President', 'hears', 'nature', 'disease', 'quickly', 'other', 'differences', 'must', 'be', 'put', 'aside', 'combat', ""'zombie"", 'menace.There', 'are', 'two', 'thumbnail', 'images', 'attached', 'movie', 'here', 'Amazon', 'one', 'attached', 'regular', 'DVD', 'show', 'towering', 'Lincoln', 'scythe', 'hanging', 'ready', 'other', 'blu-ray', 'Lincoln', 'mid-leap', 'war-face', 'scythe', 'drawn', 'back', 'tremendous', 'slash', 'first', 'probably', 'tone', 'movie', 'better', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'other', 'way', 'Yes', 'film', 'risks', 'playing', 'straight', 'opportunity', 'around', 'very', 'seldom', 'chance', 'make', 'something', 'really', 'offbeat', 'can', 'hear', 'now', ""'is"", ""n't"", 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'vs', 'Zombies', 'offbeat', 'enough', ""'No"", 'not', 'really', 'point', 'why', 'think', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'film', 'not', 'bad', 'zombie', 'flick', 'really', 'what', 'point', 'dragging', 'historical', 'baggage', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'use', 'much', 'Once', 'get', 'weirdness', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'zombie', 'killer', 'rest', 'pretty', 'straightforward', 'Instead', 'genre-busting', 'moment', 'get', 'novelty', 'zombie', 'pantheon', 'not', 'bad', 'novelty', 'never', 'totally', 'bizarre', 'level', ""'m"", 'always', 'looking', 'B-movies', 'end', 'are', 'zombie', 'movie', 'fan', 'should', 'probably', 'check', 'out', 'even', 'most', 'effects', 'are', 'level', 'of2012', 'Zombie', 'Apocalypse', 'was', 'also', 'done', 'Asylum', 'Extreme', 'gore', 'fans', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'disappointed', 'as', 'well', 'anyone', 'looking', 'extra', 'special', 'bizzare-ness', 'spice', 'up', 'Friday', 'Night', 'dinner', 'movie']",Abraham Lincoln vs Zombies

1529319,A2Q03KEBEXUEWJ,B007BS38LW,Zillaman67,"[0, 3]","I am in AWE at how this crummy 'knock-off' received 3 stars (or MORE-GAAAAAKKKK!!!) from most of these reviewers. Wow-the cinema world is in BIG trouble, as I'm guessing alot of people out there don't know their cheeks from their buttocks when it comes to a GOOD horror flick nowadays. Stay AWAY from this BAD zombie film if you know what a GREAT undead cannibal flick is like. Stay FAR away. When a film company simply exists to churn out crappy low-budget films for the sole reason of PROFIT rather than the LOVE of celluloid, people who TRULY love cinema should beware. This is 'The Asylum'. You might say Roger Corman did this very same thing for many years with New World Pictures...but there was a HUGE difference. Corman always put new screenwriters, directors and actors who had passion and TALENT into his productions. Not so with Producer David Michael Latt. Mr. Corman actually introduced us to quite a few up-and-comers who DID make a name for themselves such as Jack Nicholson, Peter Fonda, William Shatner (in 'The Intruder'), Coppola, Scorsese, James Cameron--and the list goes on. New World films had heart, soul, and were filled with genuine B-movie goodness. I Highly doubt The Asylum will produce any Coppola's or Cameron's in the near or distant future.Okay-anyone who is unfamiliar with the horror film company 'The Asylum' has either been living in a cave somewhere, or they are extremely lucky. The Asylum is a cash cow hack horror company that mostly churns out cheapo low-budget rip-off's of big studio productions at a fraction of the cost-and it shows. Oh BOY does it show. The company has been around quite awhile now-over a decade perhaps-but I may be wrong about that. 95% of the flix they produce are so bad, I can't even get through them. There are only 2 I enjoy-one was 'King Of The Ants' (which-SURPRISE, was only released by 'The Asylum'-not produced by them--Stuart Gordon directed, and Charles Higson wrote the screenplay), and the second is 'The Beast Of Bray Road'-which is by no means a classic or anything, but it does have something about it I enjoy. Maybe it's the fact that is VERY loosely based on true events (of a wolf-like cryptid), or the fact that it doesn't take itself too seriously. Also-it does NOT use cheapo CGI FX-a trend The Asylum has been relying way too heavily on the past few years. Just check out the awful CGI video game monsters their 'Sinbad' knock-off--UGGGHHH! Let's face it horror fanatics--CGI gore SUCKS. Period. If you don't have 10 million bucks to spend on CGI gore alone-do them the OLD-FASHIONED way!!! Inferior low-budget CGI is laughable at best--and it certainly shows in 'Abe Lincoln vs. Zombies'-as it does in ALL of 'The Asylum' films.And WOW-what an original (not) concept! As if we don't have enough BAD zombie films as of late...zombies are 'in' now-thanks mostly to the main stream exposure provided by 'The Walking Dead' (a great show I might add). I LOVE this genre-but HATE it at the same time thanks to films like AL vs.Z (I'll use this abbreviated title from here on in)-and I mean where the hell were all these 'zombie fanatics' 25 YEARS ago??? First off, the Asylum is famous for taking a big studio film idea and jumping the gun to create an inferior version which goes straight to dvd. And unfortunately, there are enough 'vidiots' out there who are dead from the neck up (Archie Bunker called 'em 'Meatheads') who actually RENT and WATCH this garbage to keep David Michael Latt and Co. 'in the money'...personally, I wish they'd go bankrupt. So if you haven't already heard, the genius filmmaker Tim Burton (Batman, Batman Returns, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, The Corpse Bride) has a FAR superior new film out called Abe Lincoln: Vampire Hunter ('Abe Lincoln vs. Vampires'-get it?)...so I guess you can see where this is going. The soul-suckers at The Asylum had a brainstorm one day while counting the cash they fleeced from Redbox customers, Netflix, Amazon on-demand, (and the poor, poor slobs who actually plop down their hard-earned cash at Wal-Mart when they see those nifty 'Asylum' dvd and now even BLU-RAY covers--GAAAAKKKK!) decided to rip Mr. Burton's film off. They've done this in the past with Peter Jackson's Kong remake (Asylum's 'King of the Lost World'), and more recently the 'Clash of the Titans' films. Always to TERRIBLE results. Think Sci-Fi Channel originals-but WORSE! The first thing you'll notice when watching AL vs. Z is the very slick camera work. The opening scene in which a young Abe finds his dad upstairs wounded by a chained up zombie wife he was unable to kill (how many times have we seen THIS in a zombie flick?) is actually decent. And again-the production values have improved in The Asylum's newer efforts (if they put much effort into any of them that is). But high-def digital cameras and decent cinematography can NOT help once the acting/killing begins. The fellow who plays Abe is actually not bad. But his wife (?) in the beginning whom he calls 'Mother' is SO bad-did she actually READ for the director? And she must have fell out of the ugly tree and hit EVERY branch on the way down to boot. This makes it VERY hard to believe later in the film that Abe had previously hooked up with a young hottie prior to this old maid...WTF were they thinking??? If he's capable of getting some smokin' tail like that-what's he doing with 'Aunt B.'??? Anyway, I'm getting side tracked. Let's get to the heart of the problems with AL vs. Z--the gore FX. Like I mentioned earlier-CGI gore is AWFUL. Especially when it looks like an Xbox 360 video game. Which this does. Fake-ass gore squirts in unrealistic fountains, heads fly off at odd angles, zombies stand COMPLETELY still while our hero's swing swords, scythes, and axes decapitating them all (TOO easily I might add). CGI has become a CHEAPO way to get films like this made FAST-thanks in part to all these computer FX dudes out there trying to make a name for themselves in hopes of scoring a better job with Dreamworks or ILM. Ain't happening fellas. I'll take a film with air bladders, latex prosthetics, foam appliances, tubes, and karo syrup and food coloring blood over this tripe any day of the week. I'm all for old-school on screen FX. CGI always looks like CGI-period. Even poor George Romero has fallen victim to this 'easy way out' in his last 3 films. At least in 'Land Of The Dead' it was ALMOST realistic. You could easily tell what was what. But in AL vs. Z. the final result is laughable. Oh-and the fake moustaches and beards are hysterical! Straight out of Party City! Check out Col. Stonewall Jackson for instance! LMAO! Add in only a couple of decent actors and a mostly (bad) novice supporting cast and you have a film that isn't deliberately cheezy (those films I LOVE)-but one that takes itself TOO seriously, and as a result it comes off much WORSE. It has a really bad script, and is just...well, AWFUL. My recommendation? If you MUST-watch this stinking pile of zombie poop on Netflix instead of wasting a buck at Redbox-or WORSE buying it on Amazon. Watch 'Dawn of the Dead', (either version), Fulci's 'Zombi', 28 Days/Weeks Later, Burial Ground, or 'Day of the Dead' (either version) again if you must have your undead cannibal fix. And another tidbit of wisdom coming from a horror fanatic-avoid 'The Asylum' film company as if it were a flesh-eating zombie itself! I gave this movie 1 star based simply on Abe's performance, the camera work, and better than usual production values (for The Asylum that is).
