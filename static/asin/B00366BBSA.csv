With my schedule (like Rita's, evidently), I didn't get to see all of the episodes, so I'm looking forward to watching the whole shebang again on the DVD set.

When she gets overwhelmed with her life, she decides to start a band - she loved singing when she was younger, and gave it up when she got married and had kids.Her garage band is made up of her mail-carrier, Patty (played by Tisha Campbell-Martin; I had NO IDEA that girl could SING!), her unemployed next-door neighbor Owen (Ian Gomez, now on Cougar Town), and her daughter's boyfriend Kip (short for ""Skip"").Although the band (which is never named, not even after they get a couple of gigs) is a big part of the story, it's not the only part. It's more about the relationships Rita has with her children; her ""extra"" child Kip, who is at their house all the time; her co-workers at the mega bath store where she works; Patty, who quickly becomes her best friend; and her husband Jay (played by the adorable Richard Ruccolo, formerly of Two Guys and a Girl....).Nicole Sullivan's Rita is real, funny, sarcastic, and just wonderful. (I can't say I was a big fan of Nicole before, but I am now.)The show is sweet and funny, and feels very real. I'm just soooo bummed they canceled it after just 2 seasons.

1327219,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B00366BBSA,Haunted Flower,"[5, 5]","Rita Rocks: The Complete Season One20 Episodes on 3 Discs Widescreen Edition (2010) being released on DVD April 27""Rita Rocks"" stars Nicole Sullivan from MADtv as Rita, an overworked wife, mother, and former lead singer of a Bangles cover band who in the verge of an identity crisis with her family life decides to reconnect with her past by forming a garage band with her postal worker, an unemployed neighbor, and her daughter's boyfriend. The story angle seems a little unlikely, but she mostly still has the same conflicts as other sitcoms when someone wants to pursue a hobby or new career choice with occasional garage performances that are clearly studio taped and dubbed over them giving it a slight ""Glee"" feel without the dancing.Nicole Sullivan has always been funny in MADtv and even though this is a more laid-back family version of her usual comedy, her voice and line delivery are hilarious. She is very believable as a family mom trying to keep everyone together and her singing voice is nice enough for this sitcom. She lights up the show while most of the other characters are a bit dull. Sullivan is charismatic and can still deliver lots of laugh-out-loud moments over the course of each episode.Patty is the postal worker played by Tisha Campbell-Martin from the ""Martin"" TV show and is more impressive vocally as a singer. She still carries enough attitude to be funny but her singing voice is a little better than Sullivan's. I haven't seen postal workers delivering mail door to door handing it to people since black and white TV shows in the 1950s, but they try to make it seem like it's a natural everyday occurrence. She ends up becoming the sassy black best friend who gets to throw in stuff like ""oh no she didn't!""Her husband, Jay Clemens is played by Richard Ruccolo from ""Two Guys, A Girl, and a Pizza Place."" The daughters, Shannon and Hallie are played by Kelly Gould and Natalie Dreyfuss. The family has good chemistry together but Sullivan by far is the star and has more personality than the other three combined. The best part of the family is the fact that the dog is named Yoda.This season is a great introduction to the series. Situational comedy is predictable as it goes, but this show is average to pretty funny here with Nicole Sullivan. It's too bad that it was announced in January this year that Lifetime is canceling this series after two 20 Episode seasons. So all that's left are these DVD seasons and re-runs that you would have to wait for so if you enjoy this show, probably should pick this set up.DVD Extras:There is a music video for ""Somebody to Worry About"" performed by Nicole Sullivan, Tisha Campbell Martin, Raviv Ullman, and Ian Gomez. The lyrics are very mom-centric but they fit the character well and she sings them like she means them. The video is mostly shots of them in the studio recording mixed with images from the show and it's sweet.",4,Nicole Sullivan from MADtv is a shining star as Rita and the show is pretty good most of the time,1271376000,"04 16, 2010",2010,2908,"['Rita', 'Rocks', 'Complete', 'Season', 'One20', 'Episodes', '3', 'Discs', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', '2010', 'being', 'released', 'DVD', 'April', '27', 'Rita', 'Rocks', 'Nicole', 'Sullivan', 'MADtv', 'Rita', 'overworked', 'wife', 'mother', 'former', 'lead', 'singer', 'Bangles', 'cover', 'band', 'who', 'verge', 'identity', 'crisis', 'family', 'life', 'reconnect', 'past', 'forming', 'garage', 'band', 'postal', 'worker', 'unemployed', 'neighbor', 'daughter', 'boyfriend', 'story', 'angle', 'little', 'unlikely', 'mostly', 'still', 'same', 'conflicts', 'other', 'sitcoms', 'when', 'someone', 'pursue', 'hobby', 'new', 'career', 'choice', 'occasional', 'garage', 'performances', 'are', 'clearly', 'studio', 'taped', 'dubbed', 'giving', 'slight', 'Glee', 'feel', 'dancing.Nicole', 'Sullivan', 'always', 'been', 'funny', 'MADtv', 'even', 'more', 'laid-back', 'family', 'version', 'usual', 'comedy', 'voice', 'line', 'delivery', 'are', 'hilarious', 'very', 'believable', 'family', 'mom', 'trying', 'keep', 'everyone', 'together', 'singing', 'voice', 'nice', 'enough', 'sitcom', 'show', 'most', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'bit', 'dull', 'Sullivan', 'charismatic', 'can', 'still', 'deliver', 'lots', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moments', 'course', 'episode.Patty', 'postal', 'worker', 'played', 'Tisha', 'Campbell-Martin', 'Martin', 'TV', 'show', 'more', 'impressive', 'vocally', 'singer', 'still', 'enough', 'attitude', 'be', 'funny', 'singing', 'voice', 'little', 'better', 'Sullivan', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'postal', 'workers', 'delivering', 'mail', 'door', 'door', 'handing', 'people', 'black', 'white', 'TV', 'shows', '1950s', 'try', 'make', 'seem', 'natural', 'everyday', 'occurrence', 'up', 'becoming', 'sassy', 'black', 'best', 'friend', 'who', 'throw', 'stuff', 'oh', 'did', ""n't"", 'husband', 'Jay', 'Clemens', 'played', 'Richard', 'Ruccolo', 'Two', 'Guys', 'A', 'Girl', 'Pizza', 'Place', 'daughters', 'Shannon', 'Hallie', 'are', 'played', 'Kelly', 'Gould', 'Natalie', 'Dreyfuss', 'family', 'good', 'chemistry', 'together', 'Sullivan', 'far', 'star', 'more', 'personality', 'other', 'three', 'combined', 'best', 'part', 'family', 'fact', 'dog', 'named', 'Yoda.This', 'season', 'great', 'introduction', 'series', 'Situational', 'comedy', 'predictable', 'show', 'average', 'pretty', 'funny', 'here', 'Nicole', 'Sullivan', 'too', 'bad', 'was', 'announced', 'January', 'year', 'Lifetime', 'canceling', 'series', 'two', '20', 'Episode', 'seasons', 'So', 'left', 'are', 'DVD', 'seasons', 're-runs', 'would', 'have', 'wait', 'so', 'enjoy', 'show', 'probably', 'should', 'pick', 'set', 'up.DVD', 'Extras', 'music', 'video', 'Somebody', 'Worry', 'performed', 'Nicole', 'Sullivan', 'Tisha', 'Campbell', 'Martin', 'Raviv', 'Ullman', 'Ian', 'Gomez', 'lyrics', 'are', 'very', 'mom-centric', 'fit', 'character', 'well', 'video', 'mostly', 'shots', 'studio', 'recording', 'mixed', 'images', 'show', 'sweet']",Rita Rocks: Season 1

1327223,A3W3OG4JJKFFTV,B00366BBSA,RetroRhythms,"[0, 0]","Over the last ten years, the number of quality sitcoms has consistently dwindled. Of the select group that remains, a good amount of these air on cable, rather than network television. Lifetime's &#34;Rita Rocks&#34; is one of only a handful of such shows that I've really gotten into post-2005.The premise of the show is that Rita, a late-30s/early 40s mother of two with a working husband, tries to balance her motherly duties with a retail job on top of deciding to pursue a long-stifled desire to have her own band. The resulting story lines alternate between elements of each of these aspects of her life&#8212;with the &#34;band&#34; segments often focusing on brief, yet colorful, rehearsals in Rita's garage.There are several elements that really make this series click, despite the fact that it boasts none of the over-the-top plots or far-fetched comedy that seem necessary to make a sitcom popular these days. One, the writing consistently displays a good balance of true-to-life scenarios with relatable, wholesome humor. Two, the cast members are clearly engaged in their roles, instead of pandering to a certain demographic or trend. Lead actress Nicole Sullivan is remarkably versatile yet understated; Tisha Campbell is sassy yet very likable in her role as Rita's friend/postal carrier, Patty; and Natalie Dreyfuss does a commendable job as Rita's older daughter, Hallie&#8212;effectively conveying the amusing temperament of a teenager without turning it into a stereotype.I use the term &#34;quirky&#34; in my review title because, although Sullivan (as &#34;Rita&#34;) is not a bad singer, it seems a little far-fetched that someone of her limited vocal range would be so passionate about forming a band at her stage of life. However, she plays the music-centered scenes with a genuineness that is ultimately more important than knockout vocal skills&#8212;showing that it is normal and healthy to desire to engage in one's creative side, even when life's overwhelming responsibilities of work and family seem to suggest that isn't possible. On top of that, Tisha Campbell's awesome singing (which she first displayed over 20 years earlier in the series &#34;Rags to Riches&#34;) makes up for Sullivan's shortcomings in that department.Unfortunately, Lifetime canceled &#34;Rita Rocks&#34; after only two seasons. Interestingly, the network's home entertainment division put out this DVD very quickly afterward&#8212;but never followed up with a release of season two. It's truly difficult in the post-Y2K world for a &#34;traditional&#34; sitcom to have longevity. As people's attention spans get shorter (partially due to the networks' pandering to that notion), the chances of a show with thought-out, well-developed stories staying on air for more than a year are quite slim.I'm thankful that Lifetime released this DVD, as I did not have cable at the time of the original run of &#34;Rita Rocks.&#34; Discovering the show has been a welcome retreat from most prime-time fare that currently airs. It's not outrageous; it's not extremely edgy. But it's authentic, funny, and very solidly produced. I recommend &#34;Rita Rocks: Season 1&#34; to any serious fans of the increasingly rare genre of modern-day family sitcoms. (And if you, like me, missed the show's initial airings, but know someone who taped the second-season episodes, do indeed check those out, too!).",4,Genuine and quirky...,1398470400,"04 26, 2014",2014,3390,"['last', 'ten', 'years', 'number', 'quality', 'sitcoms', 'consistently', 'dwindled', 'select', 'group', 'good', 'amount', 'air', 'cable', 'rather', 'network', 'television', 'Lifetime', '34', 'Rita', 'Rocks', '34', 'one', 'only', 'handful', 'such', 'shows', ""'ve"", 'really', 'gotten', 'post-2005.The', 'premise', 'show', 'Rita', 'late-30s/early', '40s', 'mother', 'two', 'working', 'husband', 'tries', 'balance', 'motherly', 'duties', 'retail', 'job', 'top', 'deciding', 'pursue', 'long-stifled', 'desire', 'have', 'own', 'band', 'resulting', 'story', 'lines', 'alternate', 'elements', 'aspects', 'life', '8212', '34', 'band', '34', 'segments', 'often', 'focusing', 'brief', 'yet', 'colorful', 'rehearsals', 'Rita', 'are', 'several', 'elements', 'really', 'make', 'series', 'click', 'fact', 'none', 'over-the-top', 'plots', 'far-fetched', 'comedy', 'seem', 'necessary', 'make', 'sitcom', 'popular', 'days', 'One', 'writing', 'consistently', 'good', 'balance', 'true-to-life', 'scenarios', 'relatable', 'wholesome', 'humor', 'Two', 'cast', 'members', 'are', 'clearly', 'engaged', 'roles', 'instead', 'pandering', 'certain', 'demographic', 'trend', 'Lead', 'actress', 'Nicole', 'Sullivan', 'remarkably', 'versatile', 'yet', 'understated', 'Tisha', 'Campbell', 'sassy', 'yet', 'very', 'likable', 'role', 'Rita', 'friend/postal', 'carrier', 'Patty', 'Natalie', 'Dreyfuss', 'commendable', 'job', 'Rita', 'older', 'daughter', 'Hallie', '8212', 'effectively', 'conveying', 'amusing', 'temperament', 'teenager', 'turning', 'stereotype.I', 'term', '34', 'quirky', '34', 'review', 'title', 'Sullivan', '34', 'Rita', '34', 'not', 'bad', 'singer', 'little', 'far-fetched', 'someone', 'limited', 'vocal', 'range', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'passionate', 'forming', 'band', 'stage', 'life', 'However', 'music-centered', 'scenes', 'genuineness', 'ultimately', 'more', 'important', 'knockout', 'vocal', 'skills', '8212', 'showing', 'normal', 'healthy', 'desire', 'engage', 'one', 'creative', 'side', 'even', 'when', 'life', 'overwhelming', 'responsibilities', 'work', 'family', 'seem', 'suggest', ""n't"", 'possible', 'top', 'Tisha', 'Campbell', 'awesome', 'singing', 'first', 'displayed', '20', 'years', 'earlier', 'series', '34', 'Rags', 'Riches', '34', 'up', 'Sullivan', 'shortcomings', 'department.Unfortunately', 'Lifetime', 'canceled', '34', 'Rita', 'Rocks', '34', 'only', 'two', 'seasons', 'Interestingly', 'network', 'home', 'entertainment', 'division', 'put', 'out', 'DVD', 'very', 'quickly', 'afterward', '8212', 'never', 'followed', 'up', 'release', 'season', 'two', 'truly', 'difficult', 'post-Y2K', 'world', '34', 'traditional', '34', 'sitcom', 'have', 'longevity', 'people', 'attention', 'get', 'shorter', 'partially', 'due', 'networks', 'pandering', 'notion', 'chances', 'show', 'thought-out', 'well-developed', 'stories', 'staying', 'air', 'more', 'year', 'are', 'quite', 'slim.I', ""'m"", 'thankful', 'Lifetime', 'released', 'DVD', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'cable', 'time', 'original', 'run', '34', 'Rita', 'Rocks.', '34', 'Discovering', 'show', 'been', 'welcome', 'retreat', 'most', 'prime-time', 'fare', 'currently', 'not', 'outrageous', 'not', 'extremely', 'edgy', 'authentic', 'funny', 'very', 'solidly', 'produced', 'recommend', '34', 'Rita', 'Rocks', 'Season', '1', '34', 'serious', 'fans', 'increasingly', 'rare', 'genre', 'modern-day', 'family', 'sitcoms', 'missed', 'show', 'initial', 'airings', 'know', 'someone', 'who', 'taped', 'second-season', 'episodes', 'do', 'indeed', 'check', 'too']",Rita Rocks: Season 1

1327226,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00366BBSA,trebe,"[3, 3]","A middle aged wife and working mom, who plays in a garage band in her spare time, is the center of attention in Rita Rocks (2008-2009) a comedy that aired on Lifetime for two seasons.  Comedienne Nicole Sullivan is Rita Clemens, who met her husband Jay (Richard Ruccolo) in college, while playing in Bangles cover band.  Living somewhere in Michigan, she now has two daughters, sixteen year old Hallie (Natalie Dreyfuss), and five year old Shannon (Kelly Gould).  Working part time at a bed and bath store, Rita rediscovers her passion for music, forming a band with Patty (Tisha Campbell-Martin), her local US mail carrier, Owen (Ian Gomez), a neighbor, and Kip (Ricky Ullman), her daughter Hallie's everpresent boyfriend.Sullivan is probably best known for her outrageous portrayals on MAD TV, but there are few signs of the ""Vancome Lady"" here, as she plays things mostly straight, though often with a sarcastic undertone.  Sullivan demonstrates the ability to carry a series, and displays some musical talent as well.  Tisha Campbell-Martin as Patty, is ultra-sassy, and even louder and more opinionated than Rita.  The relationship between these two strong personalities quickly becomes tight, and usually generates the most laughs.  As Rita's insurance peddling husband, Richard Ruccolo is kind of passive, and something of a goof, but he does have some good points and remains likeable.  On those occasions when her character is featured, Natalie Dreyfuss is usually pretty good as the slightly spoiled, mildly rebellious Hallie.Rita and her bandmates come together to form a group in the pilot episode.  Although each of the subsequent episodes is typically named after a popular song, it takes some time before the music becomes a significant factor.  The amount of ""rocking"" Rita does is pretty limited, as most of the early episodes are similar to a traditional domestic sitcom.  There is no question that family comes first for everyone.  After things have kind of stabilized on the home front, some of the stories begin to integrate the band aspect more effectively.In ""Old Friends"", former pop singer turned actress Debbie Gibson (now Deborah Gibson) guests as an old college friend who visits the Clements home for a reunion with Rita.  With her friend feeling a little depressed, Rita introduces her to the band, and helps restore her confidence.  Unfortunately, some people don't change, but at least Rita gets a nice lobster dinner out of a raw deal.Jay's potential client is impressed by Rita, and hires her band to play at a corporate function, in ""Get Off Of My Cloud"".  With the account possibly hanging in the balance, Jay comes up with some ideas to make the band's performance more ""appropriate"", causing friction with Rita and the band.Jay and Rita have a tradition of doing nothing special on Valentine's Day, but Rita finds that she misses having a little romance in her life.  In ""What's Love Got To Do With It"", Rita arranges a romantic surprise for Jay, but a family emergency ruins her plans.  However Jay proves that romance is still alive, and Patty dresses up to deliver a sultry number.Things finish on a high note in the season finale ""We Can Work It Out"", where Rita's promotion to manager, leaves her with little time to rehearse with the band, before an important gig.  Rita contemplates quitting the group, but everyone makes sacrifices that enables her musical dream to continue.The very likeable Nicole Sullivan, displays both her acting and musical talents here.  The band concept takes some time to gel, as the group never has a proper name, doesn't always choose the best material, and Kip goes through the first half of the season without a proper drum kit.  When finally integrated effectively, the rock band factor eventually provides some cool opportunities for humor, that helps separates Rita Rocks from your average domestic sitcom.  Fortunately, the writing improves as the season progresses, which helps the cast become more established in their roles, and the series closes strongly.  Rita Rocks isn't outrageously funny, but it is pretty entertaining fare for most families.  (Notice to parents, the ""v"" word is used in the first episode)  Nicole Sullivan can now be seen on the CBS series S#*!
