1027845,A27Q80GZDFZ92K,B000JLSYXK,Amateur Stargazer,"[11, 12]","Like the first set, this collection of ""Wild America"" contains twelve DVD's with about thirty hours of programs. The slim cases each hold two DVD's, but the discs will sometimes come loose inside the cases.  The outside box, made of thin cardboard, can easily be damaged and offers little protection to the cases inside.  There are no bonus features in this set, although it includes many episodes.  Some interviews with Marty Stouffer and the team which produced the programs would have been interesting.  But we have only a large collection of episodes in this set without any extras, which is somewhat of a disappointment since ""Wild America"" was one of the best wildlife documentaries ever made.If you love the ""Wild America"" series I would recommend this set, but you might be a little disappointed in the quality of its packaging.  The DVD's are okay for sound and picture quality and the programs are complete. It is not an expensive set if you purchase it from one of Amazon's sellers. But it seems we could have been offered something better and more durable since it is supposedly a collector's set, which people will want to own for many years.",3,"Loved the series, DVD set could have been better",1200355200,"01 15, 2008",2008,1155,"['first', 'set', 'collection', 'Wild', 'America', 'twelve', 'DVD', 'thirty', 'hours', 'programs', 'slim', 'cases', 'hold', 'two', 'DVD', 'discs', 'will', 'sometimes', 'come', 'loose', 'cases', 'outside', 'box', 'made', 'thin', 'cardboard', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'damaged', 'little', 'protection', 'cases', 'inside', 'are', 'bonus', 'set', 'many', 'episodes', 'interviews', 'Marty', 'Stouffer', 'team', 'produced', 'programs', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'have', 'only', 'large', 'collection', 'episodes', 'set', 'extras', 'somewhat', 'disappointment', 'Wild', 'America', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'wildlife', 'documentaries', 'ever', 'made.If', 'love', 'Wild', 'America', 'series', 'would', 'recommend', 'set', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'disappointed', 'quality', 'packaging', 'DVD', 'are', 'okay', 'sound', 'picture', 'quality', 'programs', 'are', 'complete', 'not', 'expensive', 'set', 'purchase', 'one', 'Amazon', 'sellers', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'offered', 'something', 'better', 'more', 'durable', 'supposedly', 'collector', 'set', 'people', 'will', 'want', 'own', 'many', 'years']",N/A
1027846,A2CGPL67ZKSLYZ,B000JLSYXK,David D,"[0, 0]","At best this series has stunning actual wildlife footage, e.g. Bighorn Rams dueling.  At worst there are many seemingly staged scenes of semi-domesticated animals set upon each other, e.g. tame cougar killing tame deer.  (These allegations have been made by collaborators on this series.)  In the middle there are many good scenes of possibly semi-domesticated animals in natural settings with good information about the natural world.  These don't seem gratuitous like the staged &#34;fights&#34;.With that in mind, just know what you are watching.  Staged scenes may not represent natural behavior at all.  (Will a Bobcat go after a Kit Fox?  I don't know, but I've been made to doubt the truth behind such scenes.)In the end, this series was a bit of a ego-project for its maker.  Each episode starts and ends with &#34;I'm Marty Stouffer...&#34;  He is front and center all the time.  Less Marty would have been preferable for the rest of us.  Nevertheless, I give credit for some nice footage of some spectacular nature.
