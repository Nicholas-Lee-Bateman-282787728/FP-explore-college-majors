1075734,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000QFCD8Q,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","One of the better surprises of 2007, I never expected `The Lookout' to be as good as it was.  I had heard a lot of good things about it, mostly with regards to Jeff Daniels' performance (Oscar worthy if you ask me), but Daniels is only one of many things worthy singling out with regards to this unpredictable and highly engrossing thriller.Chris Pratt is a legend.  He's a mere high school student, but everyone wants to either be him or be with him.  As `The Lookout' opens, Pratt is driving a car down a dark road with the lights off to show some girl how beautiful fireflies can be when he gets in an accident, permanently damaging his brain, injuring the girl and killing his two friends in the backseat.  Now, Chris attends a special school, lives with a blind man named Lewis and works as a janitor for a bank.  He wants to be better and have more but he feels stunted by those around him (outside of Lewis) who continually treat him as if he were a cripple.  His boss doesn't take him seriously when he tries to apply himself, and his parents regard him as `special'.  When he meets Gary, a charismatic and seemingly enjoyable man, things start to take shape for Chris.  He meets a beautiful woman named Luvlee and starts to interact like he once did in high school.  Then Gary drops the bomb; he wants Chris to help him rob a bank.I don't want to give away too much, for the ending is a real breathtaker, but know that this film will keep you glued to your seat for more than one reason.As far as the acting is concerned, all involved are worth mentioning really.  I've been a fan of Joseph Gordon-Levitt for a while, and he really shines here.  What I love so much about the performances of Levitt and Daniels is that they never once overplay their characters disabilities.  Everything is natural and realistic and believable.  Daniels especially is outstanding here.  He makes a very strong impact with very small amounts of screen time.  He is jovial when needed, serious when needed, profound when needed.  I completely understand the hype surrounding this performance.  Isla Fisher is beyond gorgeous and she plays her character well enough (nothing special about the performance or the character, but she knows how to play pretty) and Matthew Goode is shockingly spectacular as Gary.  He is slippery wet with charismatic danger.  I even loved what Bruce McGill did with his limited screen time (gotta love him).Scott Frank's direction is sharp, tight and brisk, which makes for a thrilling good time that never loses our interest or gets muddied down with unnecessary details.  The script is well established, the characters are real and make the needed impact, and in the end the film is memorable and exciting.What more could you ask for?",5,Be on the lookout for the tightly woven thriller...,1273449600,"05 10, 2010",2010,2755,"['One', 'better', 'surprises', '2007', 'never', 'expected', 'Lookout', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'was', 'had', 'heard', 'lot', 'good', 'things', 'mostly', 'regards', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'performance', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'ask', 'Daniels', 'only', 'one', 'many', 'things', 'worthy', 'singling', 'out', 'regards', 'unpredictable', 'highly', 'engrossing', 'thriller.Chris', 'Pratt', 'legend', 'mere', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'everyone', 'be', 'be', 'Lookout', 'opens', 'Pratt', 'driving', 'car', 'down', 'dark', 'road', 'lights', 'show', 'girl', 'how', 'beautiful', 'fireflies', 'can', 'be', 'when', 'accident', 'permanently', 'damaging', 'brain', 'injuring', 'girl', 'killing', 'two', 'friends', 'backseat', 'Now', 'Chris', 'special', 'school', 'blind', 'man', 'named', 'Lewis', 'janitor', 'bank', 'be', 'better', 'have', 'more', 'stunted', 'Lewis', 'who', 'continually', 'treat', 'were', 'cripple', 'boss', ""n't"", 'take', 'seriously', 'when', 'apply', 'parents', 'regard', 'special', 'When', 'Gary', 'charismatic', 'seemingly', 'enjoyable', 'man', 'things', 'start', 'take', 'shape', 'Chris', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'named', 'Luvlee', 'interact', 'once', 'did', 'high', 'school', 'Then', 'Gary', 'bomb', 'Chris', 'help', 'rob', 'bank.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'ending', 'real', 'breathtaker', 'know', 'film', 'will', 'keep', 'glued', 'seat', 'more', 'one', 'reason.As', 'far', 'acting', 'concerned', 'involved', 'are', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'really', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'while', 'really', 'here', 'What', 'love', 'so', 'much', 'performances', 'Levitt', 'Daniels', 'never', 'once', 'overplay', 'characters', 'disabilities', 'Everything', 'natural', 'realistic', 'believable', 'Daniels', 'especially', 'outstanding', 'here', 'very', 'strong', 'impact', 'very', 'small', 'amounts', 'screen', 'time', 'jovial', 'when', 'needed', 'serious', 'when', 'needed', 'profound', 'when', 'needed', 'completely', 'understand', 'hype', 'surrounding', 'performance', 'Isla', 'Fisher', 'gorgeous', 'character', 'well', 'enough', 'nothing', 'special', 'performance', 'character', 'how', 'play', 'pretty', 'Matthew', 'Goode', 'shockingly', 'spectacular', 'Gary', 'slippery', 'wet', 'charismatic', 'danger', 'even', 'loved', 'what', 'Bruce', 'McGill', 'did', 'limited', 'screen', 'time', 'got', 'ta', 'love', '.Scott', 'Frank', 'direction', 'sharp', 'tight', 'brisk', 'thrilling', 'good', 'time', 'never', 'interest', 'muddied', 'down', 'unnecessary', 'details', 'script', 'well', 'established', 'characters', 'are', 'real', 'make', 'needed', 'impact', 'end', 'film', 'memorable', 'more', 'could', 'ask']",N/A
1075735,A3PYIMNF2QJHE,B000QFCD8Q,Ashley,"[3, 3]","I ultimately believe that the good aspects of this movie outweigh the bad, so it's very worth checking out.The good: acting. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is obviously someone who can handle a role like this, and he's someone who can draw us in and make us feel what the character is going through. He's expressive, well spoken, and carries himself perfectly for each character he plays. Jeff Daniels has proven himself able to star in the leading role, in a movie such as The Squid And The Whale, but I also love him in supporting roles. I think the character of a blind man is so easily overacted or clich&eacute;d, but he doesn't do either of these things. Matthew Goode has never been better, I almost didn't recognize him when he first came on screen. I wish Isla Fisher had more screen time, but she was fantastic. The plot. Even if it's a common theme among movies, it was still written well and directed with ease.I suppose my only complaints, and the only reason I withhold a fifth star, is that a few things left me confused and/or concerned. First off, Chris is a highly sympathetic character, but how can he be driving when his injuries from the incident are so well spotlighted? Sometimes it seemed like he was just fine, and other times his situation was clear and obvious. That's not too big of a deal, though.

1075740,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000QFCD8Q,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[3, 3]","A wholly original but -- at the same time -- familiar film, THE LOOKOUT has that bank heist noir feel with a human twist.I started searching out Scott Frank films (writer and director of The Lookout) after watchingGet Shortymany years back. His snappy dialogue and unique look at `fish-out-of-water' characters caught my attention and I've been pleased with his most, if not all, of his work.Add to this film the talents of relative newcomer Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Brick) and veteran Jeff Daniels (Good Night, and Good Luck) and I was intrigued ...to say the least.The familiar element is the bank heist reminiscent ofThe Squeeze (1978)with Lee Van Cleef. The unfamiliar comes from Chris Pratt played by the aforementioned Joseph Gordon-Levitt. He's damaged goods. Not just mentally but physically. Involved in a car crash that killed several friends, injured another, and left Chris with a traumatic brain injury, the audience is left to ponder what would have become of an all-star athlete who now has serious lapses in memory and can only hold down a janitorial job at a local bank.Living with another handicapped man named Lewis (Jeff Daniels), the two are an odd, disabled pair. Lewis helps keep Chris on-track with his brain-injured therapy, while Chris plods along trying to make sense of the changes in his life that aren't really changes at all ...just problems with memory. His frustrations are palpable, including his problems he has with his father who doles out guilt money only as he sees fit.Into the picture comes a group of bank robbers with their eyes on Chris. Included in the group is a lovely young lady named ...well ...Luvlee (Isla Fisher). Gaining Chris' trust (and sexual advances) Luvlee soon reveals her true nature. Handing Chris into the deadly hands of her cohort Gary (Matthew Goode,Match Point), Chris finds himself at the center of the heist at the bank where he works and stuck without a way out. Or does he have one?The fact that the audience is left guessing as to the depth of Chris' brain damage is a nice ending. How much he actually knows of what he's doing and why is an unusual turn on a familiar film road. The weaving in and out of the night of Chris' deadly car crash with his current no-win situation is pulled off exceptionally well and had me glued to my seat. And Jeff Daniels' masterful portrayal of a blind man with a set of chops also added immensely to the film's success. And Luvlee is pretty nice to look at, too (wink!).A good heist film that has helped relaunch the genre in a new direction ...far removed from things like the OCEAN'S films.",4,Familiar Yet New,1210982400,"05 17, 2008",2008,2597,"['wholly', 'original', 'same', 'time', 'familiar', 'film', 'LOOKOUT', 'bank', 'heist', 'noir', 'feel', 'human', 'twist.I', 'started', 'searching', 'out', 'Scott', 'Frank', 'films', 'writer', 'director', 'Lookout', 'watchingGet', 'Shortymany', 'years', 'back', 'snappy', 'dialogue', 'unique', 'look', 'fish-out-of-water', 'characters', 'caught', 'attention', ""'ve"", 'been', 'pleased', 'most', 'not', 'work.Add', 'film', 'talents', 'relative', 'newcomer', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'Brick', 'veteran', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'was', 'intrigued', 'say', 'least.The', 'familiar', 'element', 'bank', 'heist', 'reminiscent', 'ofThe', 'Squeeze', '1978', 'Lee', 'Van', 'Cleef', 'unfamiliar', 'Chris', 'Pratt', 'played', 'aforementioned', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'damaged', 'goods', 'Not', 'just', 'mentally', 'physically', 'Involved', 'car', 'crash', 'killed', 'several', 'friends', 'injured', 'left', 'Chris', 'traumatic', 'brain', 'injury', 'audience', 'left', 'ponder', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'become', 'all-star', 'athlete', 'who', 'now', 'serious', 'lapses', 'memory', 'can', 'only', 'hold', 'down', 'janitorial', 'job', 'local', 'bank.Living', 'handicapped', 'man', 'named', 'Lewis', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'two', 'are', 'odd', 'disabled', 'pair', 'Lewis', 'keep', 'Chris', 'on-track', 'brain-injured', 'therapy', 'Chris', 'plods', 'along', 'trying', 'make', 'sense', 'changes', 'life', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'changes', 'just', 'problems', 'memory', 'frustrations', 'are', 'palpable', 'including', 'problems', 'father', 'who', 'out', 'guilt', 'money', 'only', 'picture', 'group', 'bank', 'robbers', 'eyes', 'Chris', 'Included', 'group', 'lovely', 'young', 'lady', 'named', 'well', 'Luvlee', 'Isla', 'Fisher', 'Gaining', 'Chris', 'trust', 'sexual', 'advances', 'Luvlee', 'soon', 'true', 'nature', 'Handing', 'Chris', 'deadly', 'hands', 'cohort', 'Gary', 'Matthew', 'Goode', 'Match', 'Point', 'Chris', 'center', 'heist', 'bank', 'where', 'stuck', 'way', 'out', 'have', 'one', 'fact', 'audience', 'left', 'guessing', 'depth', 'Chris', 'brain', 'damage', 'nice', 'ending', 'How', 'much', 'actually', 'what', 'doing', 'why', 'unusual', 'turn', 'familiar', 'film', 'road', 'weaving', 'night', 'Chris', 'deadly', 'car', 'crash', 'current', 'no-win', 'situation', 'pulled', 'off', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'had', 'glued', 'seat', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'masterful', 'portrayal', 'blind', 'man', 'set', 'chops', 'also', 'added', 'immensely', 'film', 'success', 'Luvlee', 'pretty', 'nice', 'look', 'too', 'wink', '.A', 'good', 'heist', 'film', 'helped', 'relaunch', 'genre', 'new', 'direction', 'far', 'removed', 'things', 'OCEAN', 'films']",N/A

I doubt he has XM Radio there as a graveyard shift janitor nor are either team's games beamed via radio into Missouri or Kansas so what gives with that choice of game?That being said, it's a small complaint as the story is fantastic, the first-time director (Scott Frank) who also wrote the brilliant script is a talent to follow but Joseph Gordon-Levitt in the lead role shows that the kid from ""Third Rock From The Sun"" is an amazingly nuanced actor able to play such a role of a brain damaged (moderately albeit) former golden boy.Kudos also to the DP for the lighting in this movie that gave you a sense of a land and time that the rest of America has forgotten as well as the note-perfect background music by James Newton Howard that evokes the tone of each scene so well.This may be a thriller but it's not your typical ""in-your-face"" one that Hollywood churns out.Definitely do not overlook The Lookout.(The extras are also quite good with a look into the mind of this lead character and how Gordon-Levitt researched and developed this signature role as well as a making of that gives you exactly what you want to know about how this project came about and was put together.)",4,only one flaw in the setup,1322956800,"12 4, 2011",2011,1781,"['only', 'reason', 'can', 'not', 'give', 'great', 'movie', 'five', 'stars', 'complete', 'misunderstanding', 'hockey', 'Canadian', 'fact', 'hockey', 'DNA', 'how', 'Kansas', 'appropriate', 'setting', 'lead', 'character', 'who', 'up', 'high', 'school', 'hockey', 'star', 'Kansas', 'first', 'last', 'always', 'basketball', 'state.Also', 'given', 'shot', 'movie', 'Manitoba', 'why', 'not', 'set', 'upper', 'Midwest', 'Minnesota', 'Wisconsin', 'where', 'hockey', 'toehold', 'Throw', 'fact', 'lead', 'character', 'game', 'radio', 'Detroit', 'Red', 'Wings', 'Columbus', 'Blue', 'Jackets', 'doubt', 'XM', 'Radio', 'there', 'graveyard', 'shift', 'janitor', 'are', 'team', 'games', 'beamed', 'radio', 'Missouri', 'Kansas', 'what', 'choice', 'game', 'being', 'said', 'small', 'complaint', 'story', 'fantastic', 'first-time', 'director', 'Scott', 'Frank', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'brilliant', 'script', 'talent', 'follow', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'lead', 'role', 'shows', 'kid', 'Third', 'Rock', 'Sun', 'amazingly', 'nuanced', 'actor', 'able', 'play', 'role', 'brain', 'damaged', 'moderately', 'former', 'golden', 'boy.Kudos', 'also', 'DP', 'lighting', 'movie', 'gave', 'sense', 'land', 'time', 'rest', 'America', 'forgotten', 'as', 'well', 'note-perfect', 'background', 'music', 'James', 'Newton', 'Howard', 'tone', 'scene', 'well.This', 'may', 'be', 'thriller', 'not', 'typical', 'in-your-face', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'churns', 'out.Definitely', 'do', 'not', 'overlook', 'Lookout', 'extras', 'are', 'also', 'quite', 'good', 'look', 'mind', 'lead', 'character', 'how', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'researched', 'developed', 'signature', 'role', 'as', 'well', 'making', 'exactly', 'what', 'want', 'know', 'how', 'project', 'came', 'about', 'was', 'put', 'together']",N/A

Taylor,"[1, 1]","This is a most engrossing film concerning a young man, who in his late High School years, had been the cause of a devastating automobile accident, killing two of his friends, severely injuring another and leaving him  mentally compromised  with serious brain trauma.  His hopes for a bright future have been dashed leaving him with a night job of janitor for a local savings bank.  He is played here by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, one of the finest young actors currently in the business.  Seeing him in a few of his other films makes it clear that he gravitates to parts that are both challenging and complex.  While watching this film I kept thinking of another actor that I thought must have had an influence on Joseph Gordon-Levitt -- Marlon Brando, of course.  Gordon-Levitt's ability to internalize his character is evident in this and other films in which  he has appeared:  Brick, Manic and, particularly, Mysterious Skin, when he was 23 years of age!The character, Chris, who is played by Gordon-Levitt is approached by a man he distantly knew from High School who is planning a heist on the bank in which Chris works at night and intends to ""use"" Chris in his plans.  I won't go any further into the plot to avoid spoiling it, but suffice it to say it is a fine film, benefiting from a superb cast and  adroit direction by  Scott Frank.I do have one question regarding the story:  Would someone with such a brain injury that would prevent him from thinking sequentially and planning his day's actions be able to drive a car, which he does several times in the film?  Driving a car must be regarded as a task highly sequential in nature.

DeRiemer,"[2, 5]","Chris Pratt was a young man with great prospects -- wealthy family, big man in high school, star soccer player, great-looking girl friend, maybe a little too self-confident. Then he was responsible for a horrific car accident. He was driving, racing down a country road late at night with his lights out, and crashed into a parked piece of construction equipment. His girl friend was severely injured. The couple with them were killed. And Chris, five years later, is dealing with the results of major brain damage that most likely won't get better. Now he shares an apartment with a blind guy, Lewis; they kind of look after each other. Chris blurts out things. He gets angry quickly when he's frustrated. He can't remember the accident, but he can remember what he was like before it. He has no girl friend now. He has a job as a night janitor in a small bank. He goes to therapy regularly. He often can't express himself well or appropriately. He can't deal with sequencing. He has to make lists of things to do in the small notebook he always carries with him. And when he writes in the notebook, ""Kill Gary,"" then pauses and writes, ""Kill Bone first,"" we know that at least Chris has his priorities straight.The Lookout was written by Scott Frank, who gave us three first-rate, tricky and some-times nasty screenplays with Malice, Dead Again and Out of Sight. This is his first directorial job. The movie starts with a great premise but then sort of drifts into a number of Hollywood-style situations where what we see isn't really necessary, except to goose up the sex and violence factors. On more than one occasion coincidence or luck plays too obvious a part. We watch how Chris is seduced and taken advantage of by a smart, sleazy guy named Gary Spargo, who, with his partner, Bone, and a couple of others plans to rob the bank where Chris works. Gary uses Chris's resentments and weaknesses, and the effect of Chris's brain injury, to reel him in as an accomplice. He'll be the poor sap who will serve as the lookout. But things go wrong. Chris changes his mind...and that doesn't impress Gary or Bone one bit. With a cop killed, with Chris' friend, Lewis, taken hostage and threatened, Chris has to find some way to take action. All he can do is make his lists...and then take it one step at a time. The conclusion, if you couldn't guess, is violent, but it all works out for everyone except, of course, Gary and Bone.Matthew Goode plays Gary Spargo in a heavily sleazy and dramatic way. I assume that's how the director wanted it. (It's amazing to me how many British actors can lose every trace of their accent when playing Americans. Or Australians playing Americans, for that matter. I was convinced Guy Pearce and Russell Crowe in L. A. Confidential were just excellent American actors I'd never heard of.) Greg Dunham plays Bone, who almost never says a word. Bone always wears a long, black coat, has long, black hair and wears black sunglasses. He's not a man to irritate. Dunham has no record on IMDb and looks a lot like Sam Shepherd. I wonder.... Jeff Daniels has a great time as the blind Lewis, a man who has been around, knows the score and genuinely cares for Chris. The star of the movie really is Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Chris Pratt. This isn't just a case of a star turn for an actor playing someone with a disability. Gordon-Levitt keeps it toned down. He doesn't try to appeal for our sympathy. We can see and respond to Chris' frustrations; he's likable and a little irritating. Gordon-Levitt, in my view, turns in a heavy-weight performance.The Lookout, it seems to me, is a movie that doesn't quite make it, but comes close.",4,An interesting movie with an intriguing premise and a fine performance by Joseph Gordon-Levitt,1176076800,"04 9, 2007",2007,3659,"['Chris', 'Pratt', 'was', 'young', 'man', 'great', 'prospects', 'wealthy', 'family', 'big', 'man', 'high', 'school', 'star', 'soccer', 'player', 'great-looking', 'girl', 'friend', 'maybe', 'little', 'too', 'self-confident', 'Then', 'was', 'responsible', 'horrific', 'car', 'accident', 'was', 'driving', 'racing', 'down', 'country', 'road', 'late', 'night', 'lights', 'out', 'crashed', 'parked', 'piece', 'construction', 'equipment', 'girl', 'friend', 'was', 'severely', 'injured', 'couple', 'were', 'killed', 'Chris', 'five', 'years', 'later', 'dealing', 'results', 'major', 'brain', 'damage', 'most', 'likely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'better', 'Now', 'shares', 'apartment', 'blind', 'guy', 'Lewis', 'kind', 'look', 'other', 'Chris', 'out', 'things', 'angry', 'quickly', 'when', 'frustrated', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'accident', 'can', 'remember', 'what', 'was', 'girl', 'friend', 'now', 'job', 'night', 'janitor', 'small', 'bank', 'therapy', 'regularly', 'often', 'ca', ""n't"", 'express', 'well', 'appropriately', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deal', 'sequencing', 'make', 'lists', 'things', 'do', 'small', 'notebook', 'always', 'when', 'notebook', 'Kill', 'Gary', 'then', 'Kill', 'Bone', 'first', 'know', 'least', 'Chris', 'priorities', 'straight.The', 'Lookout', 'was', 'written', 'Scott', 'Frank', 'who', 'gave', 'three', 'first-rate', 'tricky', 'some-times', 'nasty', 'screenplays', 'Malice', 'Dead', 'Again', 'Out', 'Sight', 'first', 'directorial', 'job', 'movie', 'great', 'premise', 'then', 'sort', 'drifts', 'number', 'Hollywood-style', 'situations', 'where', 'what', 'see', ""n't"", 'really', 'necessary', 'goose', 'up', 'sex', 'violence', 'factors', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'coincidence', 'luck', 'plays', 'too', 'obvious', 'part', 'watch', 'how', 'Chris', 'seduced', 'taken', 'advantage', 'smart', 'sleazy', 'guy', 'named', 'Gary', 'Spargo', 'who', 'partner', 'Bone', 'couple', 'others', 'plans', 'rob', 'bank', 'where', 'Chris', 'Gary', 'Chris', 'resentments', 'weaknesses', 'effect', 'Chris', 'brain', 'injury', 'reel', 'accomplice', ""'ll"", 'be', 'poor', 'sap', 'who', 'will', 'serve', 'lookout', 'things', 'go', 'wrong', 'Chris', 'mind', ""n't"", 'impress', 'Gary', 'Bone', 'one', 'bit', 'cop', 'killed', 'Chris', 'friend', 'Lewis', 'taken', 'hostage', 'threatened', 'Chris', 'find', 'way', 'take', 'action', 'can', 'do', 'make', 'lists', 'then', 'take', 'one', 'step', 'time', 'conclusion', 'could', ""n't"", 'guess', 'violent', 'out', 'everyone', 'course', 'Gary', 'Bone.Matthew', 'Goode', 'Gary', 'Spargo', 'heavily', 'sleazy', 'dramatic', 'way', 'assume', 'how', 'director', 'wanted', 'amazing', 'how', 'many', 'British', 'actors', 'can', 'lose', 'trace', 'accent', 'when', 'playing', 'Americans', 'Australians', 'playing', 'Americans', 'matter', 'was', 'convinced', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'L.', 'A', 'Confidential', 'were', 'just', 'excellent', 'American', 'actors', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'Greg', 'Dunham', 'Bone', 'who', 'almost', 'never', 'word', 'Bone', 'always', 'long', 'black', 'coat', 'long', 'black', 'hair', 'black', 'sunglasses', 'not', 'man', 'irritate', 'Dunham', 'record', 'IMDb', 'lot', 'Sam', 'Shepherd', 'wonder', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'great', 'time', 'blind', 'Lewis', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'around', 'score', 'genuinely', 'cares', 'Chris', 'star', 'movie', 'really', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'Chris', 'Pratt', ""n't"", 'just', 'case', 'star', 'turn', 'actor', 'playing', 'someone', 'disability', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'keeps', 'toned', 'down', ""n't"", 'try', 'appeal', 'sympathy', 'can', 'see', 'respond', 'Chris', 'frustrations', 'likable', 'little', 'irritating', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'view', 'heavy-weight', 'performance.The', 'Lookout', 'movie', ""n't"", 'quite', 'make', 'close']",N/A

This time, instead of his character's being emotionally broken from the trauma of child abuse, here he is quite physically broken as auto accident survivor (and instigator) Chris Pratt.Pratt is a former big man on his high school campus, a one-time hockey star from a wealthy family who is now resigned to reliving past glories by slap-shooting urinal pucks on the floor of the bank he sweeps at night.  Meanwhile, his patronizing and far-from-understanding parents partially subsidize him as he tries to live with not only the brain damage from the accident but also his survivor's guilt at having been responsible for the deaths of two others in the car he helmed.Jeff Daniels turns in a reliably excellent performance as Chris' most reliably excellent (and possibly only) friend Lewis, who's blind from a self-inflicted calamity of his own.  Together they live in a Kansas City apartment and try to help each other through their respective recoveries.And much like the movie Memento's protagonist Leonard (as well as a few of my more substance-abusing college friends), Chris has trouble with memory and sequencing, except Chris somewhat pragmatically and cost effectively opts solely for a small spiral bound notebook to substitute for his short-term memory instead of the additional tattoos and photos that Leonard used (my college friends opted mostly for Blackberries).Needless to say, this puts him in quite a vulnerable place, so he's an easy mark when alleged ex-classmate Gary Spargo (Matthew Goode, who is actually great) ropes him into a sketchy ""friendship"" complete with babes on his arms who just happen to put out at the drop of a disinhibited frontal lobe-damaged solicitation.  You know, the package deal.Soon Chris learns that these new friendships have strings attached that may take more than a few acetylene torches to sever (hint: they want his help to rob the bank where he works.  But you probably already know that).  What follows is a taut but sometimes messy noir heist movie that, despite some of the misplaced pieces the completed puzzle is left with, is still as satisfyingly-layered a crime thriller as such other artfully executed films as ""A Simple Plan"" and ""Out of Sight"" (the latter of which, non-coincidentally enough, ""Lookout"" writer/director Scott Frank also wrote).For a first-time director, Frank adds a lot of lovely flourishes, and for every piece that seems to be a tad disjointed or that doesn't fit perfectly, there is a deft directorial touch somewhere else that makes you not mind as much if some of those other pieces are a bit forcefully jammed in to fit the picture.  Flawed but ultimately riveting and rewarding fare, ""The Lookout"" is a guilty pleasure that lets Gordon-Levitt handle most of the guilt, leaving you with most of the pleasure.

Frank crafted both a sad and uplifting story surrounding a young former star high school hockey icon played by Gordon Levitt named Chris Pratt.  Pratt was driving his convertible with three close friends and owing to a mindless teenaged prank became involved in a multi fatality road accodent.  We catch up, to Pratt 4 years later to learn that while he survived, he suffered massive head injuries resulting in brain damage.Still harboring deep feelings of guilt, therapy is helping give Pratt some semblance of his life back.  He is working as a night janitor at a local Kansas bank sharing an apartment with his perceptive but blind roommate Lewis played superbly by Daniels.Unable to properly sequence his thought processes he is duped into a friendship with ex-con Gary Spargo played by Matthew Goode.  Using a fetching Isla Fisher playing Luvlee to seduce him, Spargo reels in Pratt involving him in a plot to rob the bank he works in.Against Daniels well intentioned warnings, Gordon Levitt finds himself in too deep and with limited mental faculties must find a way make things right.Using a pseudo film noir style, Frank really strikes gold as this under publicized film touches heavily on the subject of the handicapped and their exploitation.

Now, he's finally gotten the chance to direct his own movie and the result is The Lookout, a neo-noir that evokes other crime movies like Charley Varrick and Fargo.Joseph Gordon-Levitt continues his knack for offbeat roles. He does a great job portraying someone with neurological damage and the frustration that comes from not being able to do simple things like opening a can of food or remembering someone's name. He also conveys the guilt his character feels over the car accident that robbed him of a promising future. We see how he tries to hide his disorder and the frustration of not being able to do basic things. It's a performance grounded in realism that is in contrast to this stylized noir world. It doesn't hurt that he is surrounded by cold, detached characters, and this makes him very sympathetic as well.Jeff Daniels steals pretty much every scene he's in as Chris' genial roommate. The actor displays a dry sense of humour that is very funny to see in action. He and Gordon-Levitt's character make for very unlikely roommates to say the least but the two actors make it work thanks to the excellent chemistry they have together. Along with The Squid in the Whale  and Good Night, and Good Luck, Daniels is turning out to be quite an excellent character actor appearing in several well-made independent films.Frank has a keen visual sense, adopting a predominantly dark colour scheme in keeping with the neo-noir tradition. He has crafted a clever little thriller with a fascinating protagonist at its centre. What could have easily been a forgettable film is anchored by yet another riveting performance by Gordon-Levitt.""Behind the Mind of Christ Pratt"" features an interview with the film's star, Joseph Gordon-Levitt. He was drawn to the complexity of the character and ended up living with the role for almost a year. He talks about how he portrayed Chris and speaks intelligently about his take on the material.""Sequencing The Lookout"" takes a look at various aspects of the movie: the script, casting, the look, and so on in an interesting way. Frank says that he was influenced by European thrillers that emphasized character. He talks about the origins of the story as well.Finally, there is an audio commentary by writer/director Scott Frank and his director of photography Alar Kivilo. Frank isn't afraid to point out the mistakes he made as a first-time director. With Kivilo, their comments tend to be about filmmaking techniques like the cameras they used, the type of shots for a given scene and locations used. This could come across as kind of dull if you're not into the technical aspects of film.",5,Another impressive effort by Joseph Gordon-Levitt,1186963200,"08 13, 2007",2007,2795,"['adaptation', 'Elmore', 'Leonard', 'novel', 'Out', 'Sight', 'Scott', 'Frank', 'demonstrated', 'knack', 'crime', 'thrillers', 'plenty', 'plot', 'twists', 'double', 'crosses', 'Now', 'finally', 'gotten', 'chance', 'direct', 'own', 'movie', 'result', 'Lookout', 'neo-noir', 'other', 'crime', 'movies', 'Charley', 'Varrick', 'Fargo.Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'knack', 'offbeat', 'roles', 'great', 'job', 'portraying', 'someone', 'neurological', 'damage', 'frustration', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'do', 'simple', 'things', 'opening', 'can', 'food', 'remembering', 'someone', 'name', 'also', 'conveys', 'guilt', 'character', 'feels', 'car', 'accident', 'robbed', 'promising', 'future', 'see', 'how', 'hide', 'disorder', 'frustration', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'do', 'basic', 'things', 'performance', 'grounded', 'realism', 'contrast', 'stylized', 'noir', 'world', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'surrounded', 'cold', 'detached', 'characters', 'very', 'sympathetic', 'well.Jeff', 'Daniels', 'steals', 'pretty', 'much', 'scene', 'Chris', 'genial', 'roommate', 'actor', 'dry', 'sense', 'humour', 'very', 'funny', 'see', 'action', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'character', 'make', 'very', 'unlikely', 'roommates', 'say', 'least', 'two', 'actors', 'make', 'work', 'thanks', 'excellent', 'chemistry', 'have', 'together', 'Squid', 'Whale', 'Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'Daniels', 'turning', 'out', 'be', 'quite', 'excellent', 'character', 'actor', 'appearing', 'several', 'well-made', 'independent', 'films.Frank', 'keen', 'visual', 'sense', 'adopting', 'predominantly', 'dark', 'colour', 'scheme', 'keeping', 'neo-noir', 'tradition', 'crafted', 'clever', 'little', 'thriller', 'fascinating', 'protagonist', 'centre', 'What', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'forgettable', 'film', 'anchored', 'yet', 'riveting', 'performance', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'Mind', 'Christ', 'Pratt', 'interview', 'film', 'star', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'was', 'drawn', 'complexity', 'character', 'ended', 'up', 'living', 'role', 'almost', 'year', 'how', 'portrayed', 'Chris', 'intelligently', 'take', 'material', 'Sequencing', 'Lookout', 'look', 'various', 'aspects', 'movie', 'script', 'casting', 'look', 'so', 'interesting', 'way', 'Frank', 'was', 'influenced', 'European', 'thrillers', 'emphasized', 'character', 'origins', 'story', 'well.Finally', 'audio', 'commentary', 'writer/director', 'Scott', 'Frank', 'director', 'photography', 'Alar', 'Kivilo', 'Frank', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'point', 'out', 'mistakes', 'made', 'first-time', 'director', 'Kivilo', 'comments', 'tend', 'be', 'filmmaking', 'techniques', 'cameras', 'used', 'type', 'shots', 'given', 'scene', 'locations', 'used', 'could', 'come', 'kind', 'dull', ""'re"", 'not', 'technical', 'aspects', 'film']",N/A

1075755,A2NH6XSE79X3VY,B000QFCD8Q,Dave,"[4, 10]","The problem I have with this movie is it spends a long time developing charactors that have no impact on the plot.  The overall premise of the film has potential, but you spend over an hour watching people interact with each other that have absolutely no bearing on the point.  For example, the janitor's family- why spend a 1/2 hour at Thanksgiving dinner with these unimportant cast members?  The stripper girlfriend of the main actor- she is introduced, developed, then never seen again after the bank heist.  The blind roommate- why does this guy even exist?  He adds nothing to the plot, and despite his constant skeptisicm of the janitor's new friends, he helps him in no way.This movie is a very basic tale of scheming burglars trying to capitalize on a simple-minded janitor.  If they kept along those lines, this film could have been better.

1075759,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,B000QFCD8Q,General Zombie,"[3, 3]","With the rise of Quentin Tarantino and Guy Ritchie, the ever popular crime and heist films genres have grown more outlandish, as seen in the baffling nightmare ""Running Scared"" and the out and out parodies of ""Shoot `em Up"" and the ""Crank"" films. Released into such a market, the contemplative ""The Lookout"" was likely doomed to a  lukewarm public reception. Fortunately, DVD has been kind to many overlooked films, and hopefully ""The Lookout"" will find a second-life in the coming years. While few will find the hair-raising thriller they probably expected, ""The Lookout"" is one of the more engrossing and moving human dramas in recent memory, though given a crime/heist sheen that will make it palatable to testosterone-oriented audiences, like myself.Though heist films most often hinge on labyrinthine plots, ""The Lookout"" is rooted in the terrific lead performance of Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Long best known as ""that one kid in the sitcom with aliens"" (Third Rock From the Sun), Gordon-Levitt transitioned to film a few years ago and has earned surprising accolades. Though I can't speak for his work generally, his Chris Pratt is a remarkably sympatheic and compelling protagonist, and he gives the films a human quality rare to contemporary crime and heist films. The general story offers no great surprises, but the film's humanity makes the final result more personally moving than any elaborate plot machinations could.We're first introduced to Chris Pratt as a teenager, where he's the quintessential promising youth, a Midwestern hockey star and the son of a well-to-do family. Whatever advantages Pratt had, however, he was not spared teen idiocy, which he uses in causing a senseless car crash which kills and cripples his friends while leaving Pratt with a severe head injury. We next see Pratt a half-decade later, where he struggles with impulse control, aphasia and a general inability to mentally organize his life. His previous dreams shattered, Pratt works alone as a bank's night janitor, and confides only in his blind ex-hippie roommate Lewis, (Jeff Daniels) and his case worker Janet (Carla Gugino). Pratt, though functioning (barely), hopes for more out of life, and soon meets Gary Spargo (Matthew Goode), a shifty but sympathetic local character. Spargo is Pratt's only friend apart from Lewis, and the tie is cemented when Pratt falls for Spargo's friend Luvlee (Isla Fisher). Spargo's friendship is indeed superficial, as he eventually reveals his plan to rob Pratt's bank, with Pratt as the titular lookout. Though Pratt has no natural inclinations towards crime, he can't help but see this as an opportunity to escape his seemingly hopeless life, and, especially, to maintain a relationship with Luvlee.In further contrast to conventional crime films, ""The Lookout"" has compactm limited form that makes it much more plausible and personal than other flims. Just as how the bank heist is not especially elaborate, neither are Pratt's motivations grandiose. He does not dream of wealth or a life of luxury, but wants an unassuming middle class life and some small sense of control over his destiny. He is not, however, a plaster saint: the terrible accident is wholly his fault, and Pratt can be quite cold or hostile towards those who would help him. Equally impressive is the cast of secondary characters, none of whom play as cliched crime films types. Goode, a Brit best known for playing cold and effete roles in ""Match Point"" and ""Watchmen,"" creates a lively, surprisingly charismatic lowlife in Spargo, while Daniels adds a lot of humor and sympathy to Pratt's roomie Lewis in what could've been a throwaway role. The film handles the middle American characters with surprising care, portraying even the more dimwitted figures with realism and understanding. (I'm thinking particularly of Fisher's ex-stripper Luvlee and Di Zio's Deputy Ted, a local cop who checks in on Pratt in a manner both friendly and condescending.)After an hour of background and character development, the standard plot machinations come into effect with the requisite action scenes, complications and betrayals. First-time director Frank uses an appropriately distant, icy look for a the frigid Midwestern setting, and the film wholly lacks the self-conscious stylization of most modern crime pics. (Those of you who hate shakycam and schizoid editing will prefer this to most contemporaries.) The actual heist elements are not especially stunning, but they provide punctuation to the inner struggles that consumed the rest of the film. ""The Lookout"", ultimately, is not really about the heist, but about Pratt's oppressive and monotonous day-to-day life and how we come to understand his desperate need to escape. The heist was not the best option, needless to say, but we can understand both how he could give into such temptations and his misgivings and second thoughts that play heavily into the actual robbery.In the end the film is wrapped up in a rather clean, tight manner. This is a somewhat inappropriate, considering the sprawling, free-form nature of the early narrative. That said, it offers a certain satisfaction. In the real world the narrative would not likely resolve itself as it does in ""The Lookout."" But damned if we often don't wish that it would.Grade: A-",5,A heist film with humanity,1249689600,"08 8, 2009",2009,5290,"['rise', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'Guy', 'Ritchie', 'ever', 'popular',

The cast is superb and the film ranks with the fine 'sleepers' of the year. It is a movie that is not to be overlooked.Chris Pratt (Joseph Gordon-Levitt, rapidly becoming one of the top screen presences) is one year post automobile accident that has left him with altered memory function. Once a banner boy in athletics and scholastics, he is now reduced to living his life with the aid of a pocket notebook that 'reminds' him to 'wake up, shower with soap, get dressed etc'.  He lives with a blind roommate Lewis (Jeff Daniels in another fine performance) who works with Chris, helping him adjust to his handicap by teaching him to work backwards in his thinking as an aid to progressive memory capture.  Chris carries a card with him that informs people he is brain damaged and for the most part people are kind and help him go about his daily routine: he works as a janitor in a bank with the hopes of becoming a teller one day.  Chris encounters an old acquaintance Gary (Matthew Goode) in a bar and after a conversation Gary sees Chris as a perfect foil for a planned robbery of the bank where Chris works at night. The mounting frustrations of Chris' handicap bring him to the point where he will do anything for change and he hesitantly agrees to be the lookout for the back robbery.  When the night of the robbery arrives and things go awry, Chris reverses his decision to participate and the traumas that occur bring Chris' memory back and a surprise resolution to the story is very successful on many levels.The script is beautifully crafted and impeccably delivered by Gordon-Levitt, Daniels, Goode and the supporting cast.  The DVD featurettes are almost as exciting in the information they offer, especially from Gordon-Levitt, as the film itself. This is an example of a low budget film that is smart, classy, addresses human issues in a straightforward manner, and has more depth than the majority of films that have come out this year.  It is a film that is highly recommended viewing on many levels.

1075763,A1X15AQVSCKKRG,B000QFCD8Q,GreatMovieCriticForever,"[4, 6]","Albeit so predictable after the ""real"" plot is revealed. Still I got to recommend the film because it has great acting , and the movie overall was well polished. I saw this last year at a screening in California and it was decent.(Spoilers) Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Chris Pratt who was out cruising with his friends. They get into an auto accident and pretty much Chris is the only survivor. He falls into a coma and awakens four years later and is trying painfully to pick up the shattered pieces of his life.He's pretty much hit rock bottom, he's the janitor of a bank that doesn't appreciate him and his boss Mr. Turdle doesn't want to take a chance on him becoming a real banker.Anyways, Pratt meets Gary Bargo (Matthew Goode who gives a great performance as the villain). Gary pretty much comes across as Mr. Cool, and Pratt even tries to steal his lines to pick up girls every time failing. Gary comes across as an OK guy but he has an agenda. Gary wants to rob banks and knowing that Pratt works at one wants Chris to help. Yeah it gets predictable after this point, but there are interesting bits in here.Chris has a great friend named Lewis Canfield (played by Jeff Daniels who is utterly brilliant here) whose blind. Lewis is sort of the guardian for Chris because Chris's dad is really an ahole. The type of guy that says he wants to help out his son but doesn't want to put his money where his mouth and deliver the goods (i.e. shell out the money for him to succeed). Enter, Gary again who realizes this and tells Pratt that his parents are basically sustaining Chris but at the same time not really helping him enough to be independent.Gary sweetens the plan to rob the bank by introducing him to Luvlee Lemons (played by Isla Fisher who my God is incredibly beautiful and talented). Some people will debate that Luvlee is there to use Pratt but it's obvious by her absence by the end of this movie that she really did not love him.Anyways, the plan goes but Pratt gets cold feet about carrying out the bank robbery but Gary will make him follow it whether he wants to or not...... Like I said, it becomes predictable when the bank robbery scenario is introduced but this movie has such exceptional performances by everyone involved that I still have to recommend it. I think anyone whose seen this would have to agree.Thumbs up!!!!",5,Decent movie that is very enjoyable,1175817600,"04 6, 2007",2007,2348,"['Albeit', 'so', 'predictable', 'real', 'plot', 'revealed', 'Still', 'got', 'recommend', 'film', 'great', 'acting', 'movie', 'overall', 'was', 'well', 'polished', 'saw', 'last', 'year', 'screening', 'California', 'was', 'decent', 'Spoilers', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'Chris', 'Pratt', 'who', 'was', 'out', 'cruising', 'friends', 'get', 'auto', 'accident', 'pretty', 'much', 'Chris', 'only', 'survivor', 'coma', 'four', 'years', 'later', 'trying', 'painfully', 'pick', 'up', 'shattered', 'pieces', 'life.He', 'pretty', 'much', 'hit', 'rock', 'bottom', 'janitor', 'bank', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'boss', 'Mr.', 'Turdle', ""n't"", 'want', 'take', 'chance', 'becoming', 'real', 'banker.Anyways', 'Pratt', 'Gary', 'Bargo', 'Matthew', 'Goode', 'who', 'great', 'performance', 'villain', 'Gary', 'pretty', 'much', 'Mr', 'Cool', 'Pratt', 'even', 'steal', 'lines', 'pick', 'up', 'girls', 'time', 'failing', 'Gary', 'across', 'OK', 'guy', 'agenda', 'Gary', 'rob', 'banks', 'knowing', 'Pratt', 'one', 'Chris', 'help', 'Yeah', 'predictable', 'point', 'are', 'interesting', 'bits', 'here.Chris', 'great', 'friend', 'named', 'Lewis', 'Canfield', 'played', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'who', 'utterly', 'brilliant', 'here', 'blind', 'Lewis', 'sort', 'guardian', 'Chris', 'Chris', 'dad', 'really', 'ahole', 'type', 'guy', 'help', 'out', 'son', ""n't"", 'want', 'put', 'money', 'where', 'mouth', 'deliver', 'goods', 'i.e', 'shell', 'out', 'money', 'succeed', 'Enter', 'Gary', 'again', 'who', 'Pratt', 'parents', 'are', 'basically', 'sustaining', 'Chris', 'same', 'time', 'not', 'really', 'helping', 'enough', 'be', 'independent.Gary', 'sweetens', 'plan', 'rob', 'bank', 'introducing', 'Luvlee', 'Lemons', 'played', 'Isla', 'Fisher', 'who', 'God', 'incredibly', 'beautiful', 'talented', 'people', 'will', 'debate', 'Luvlee', 'there', 'use', 'Pratt', 'obvious', 'absence', 'end', 'movie', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'love', 'him.Anyways', 'plan', 'Pratt', 'cold', 'feet', 'carrying', 'out', 'bank', 'robbery', 'Gary', 'will', 'make', 'follow', 'not', 'said', 'predictable', 'when', 'bank', 'robbery', 'scenario', 'introduced', 'movie', 'such', 'exceptional', 'performances', 'everyone', 'involved', 'still', 'have', 'recommend', 'think', 'anyone', 'seen', 'would', 'have', 'agree.Thumbs', 'up']",N/A

He now has to write everything down so he doesn't forget. With his disability he doesn't have many friends or a good job so he isn't that happy. His only true friend is a blind man named Lewis played by the awesome Jeff Daniels (Pleasantville) who wants to open up a resturant with him.

Chris doesn't love the idea but he's short on money and he knows he needs money to prove to his parents ""mostly his dad"" that he can be independent.The result is a gripping and very well made film that's well acted and unpredictable. Sure it's kinda Memento with a bank robbery yet it still seems fresh since it's so well done. Joseph Gordon-Levitt not only gives probably his best performance but an Oscar worthy one. Same goes for Jeff Daniels who's also fantastic. Who cares that not enough people have seen this movie or even heard of it.

1075772,A33CLVW2K7SL1P,B000QFCD8Q,Jonathan Appleseed,"[5, 10]","The Lookout tells the story of Chris Pratt (Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Mysterious Skin), a former high-school hockey star who suffered a severe head injury in a car crash that he caused. We see the crash in the beginning of the film. He's with his girlfriend and two other friends, and while driving down a country road at night he turns the headlights off. As it is a country road, there are no streetlamps, so all they see are fireflies racing by set against the backdrop of a clear night sky of stars. It's a gorgeous and closely shot scene, almost faerie-like in its wonder. But his passengers soon feel fear, and urge him to turn the lights back on. As soon as he does, the cameras pull way back and the headlights shine upon a combine in the middle of the road (odd place for a combine??), and they crash head on. His girlfriend loses her leg, the other couple is killed, and he suffers a severe head injury that leaves him brain damaged.Four years later, we find him living in a small apartment with a blind roommate, Lewis (Jeff Daniels, The Squid and the Whale). Chris now needs notes to remind him to do simple things, such as to grind the coffee beans before trying to make a pot of coffee (although he could just buy pre-ground coffee...little details like this slip past in the script, but are easily forgiven as they convey a potent message). He even writes down things like, ""Get up, take a shower with soap"", and on his alarm clock is a reminder to turn it off after it wakes him up. He keeps a spare key in the bottom of his shoe because he seems to leave his keys in the ignition of his car on a daily basis. He has a social worker that tries to help him, but Chris's inappropriate overtures to her interrupt that help. His life - what we learn was somewhat of a superstar life - is left behind, and all he has left is this shell.Gordon-Levitt does a terrific job in an understated performance. We've seen actors in roles like this before, and they always make sure to remind us through very specific facial tics or movements that they are, as Lewis refers to them once, ""gimps"". His sad, old-soul eyes tell more of the story than his movements. Gordon-Levitt is easily one of the best actors of his generation. His performances in Manic, Brick, and most notably Mysterious Skin tag him as an actor to watch.Chris runs into Gary Spargo (Matthew Goode, Match Point), who claims to have known Chris since high school. Chris doesn't remember him, but when Gary mentions that he went out with his sister Alison (who later tells Chris that she doesn't remember him), Chris good-naturedly believes him. Gary introduces Chris to some girls the next night, and one of them, Luvlee Lemons (Isla Fisher, Wedding Crashers) appears keenly interested in Chris. She reminds him of a hockey game that she saw him in, which reminds him of what he used to be. Gary and his friends do this often, reminding Chris of who he was, how much he has lost, and how impotent he is. It's part of a well-rehearsed con. Once Chris begins to piece together who he was, and is keenly aware that his existence depends on others,And what he wants is this: Chris is a night janitor in a bank, and Gary wants to rob that bank.I had difficulty believing that Chris would have found employment in a bank. With all the sympathy I would have for anyone in Chris's position, I would not put him by himself in a position where he's alone with tens of thousands of dollars. Remember, he needs to write notes that say, ""take a shower *with soap*"". Gary and his pals also expect quite a bit from Chris, and again, you'd have to be a fool to do so with so much riding on him getting everything right.The bank manager and Gary aren't the only ones expecting much of Chris: the director, Scott Frank (a screenwriter turned first-time director with this film) is expecting much as well.

1075775,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B000QFCD8Q,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[5, 5]","It's interesting to see how young actors grow over the course of their career (no, I'm not talking about their height), seeing how they hone their craft through each role they take. Take Joseph Gordon-Levitt, for instance, here's a young man whose biggest success in his career to date had been the 6 seasons he spent as Tommy Solomon on TV's hilarious sitcom ""3rd Rock From the Sun"". Since that time, and even some during his tenure on the show, Joseph has appeared in a few films, such as ""The Juror"" opposite Demi Moore and ""Halloween: H20"" opposite Jamie Lee Curtis, but most of his movie appearances were supporting roles with not a whole lot to do. In 2005, Joseph received critical acclaim for his work in the independent film ""Brick"" in which he was the lead actor, a role that may have led to his receiving the lead role in this film, the critically praised ""The Lookout"" opposite Jeff Bridges (""Blood Work"") and Isla Fisher (""Wedding Crashers"").""The Lookout"" is the story of Chris Pratt (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a young man who suffers from memory lapses due to a head injury sustained during a deadly car crash. In an effort to feel normal, Chris holds down a job as a night janitor at a local bank, he has aspirations of becoming a teller and moving up the ladder at the bank, but is constantly thwarted by his condition. Even though he feels depressed his blind roommate Lewis (Jeff Daniels) is constantly trying to help him get better day-by-day. One lonely night, a con man begins to take advantage of Chris' condition by luring him with the possibility of a better life; the catch is that Chris must help them rob the very bank he works for.This movie looked intriguing when I first saw the previews, the story appeared to be interesting, and boasted a great screenwriter in Scott Frank (writer of ""Minority Report"" and ""The Interpreter"") pulling double duty as both writer and director for the first time. But as intriguing as the movie appeared I was a little unsure about the lead actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt. At the time all I had seen him in was ""3rd Rock From the Sun"" and a couple of his films that I listed above, so I didn't know if he really had enough of a serious side to his acting to carry off what appeared to be a relatively heavy role. Then I heard about how good Joseph's work was in the film ""Brick"", a movie that I have yet to see,  but the critical praise was enough to inspire more confidence in him for this movie.After watching ""The Lookout"" I can honestly say that my concerns over the possible lacking of versatility Joseph Gordon-Levitt may possess could not have been more wrong. Joseph does such an excellent job as Chris in this movie that you can't help but pay attention to him when he's on screen. To properly do justice to the character of Chris and his condition, Joseph spent ample time researching head injuries similar to the kind Chris suffered from, and those that were both milder and much worse, so that he would have a full appreciation for the affliction, in order to not make light of it. Jeff Daniels was terrific in the supporting role as Chris' blind roommate Lewis; he conveys Lewis' caring for Chris as both a friend and father figure. Matthew Goode and Isla Fisher are both solid as the two people primarily responsible for manipulating Chris to their plans, and both give subtle performances as the villains making their characters even more believable in the process.The movie as a whole was well paced, opting for a slow-boil type of feel, as opposed to a high-octane actioner, which seems to be the standard for most Hollywood caper films (""The Italian Job""). I also found it interesting to see the great lengths writer/director Scott Frank went to in illustrating for the audience just how hard life is for Chris, how even the day to day tasks can be so frustrating for him, especially when he is able to remember his former life yet can never reclaim it. By showing how frustrating Chris' lot in life is to him, it's easy to see how through loneliness and despair it would be easy to be tempted by the prospect of a better life, even if the means are not quite legal.

Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","Within the traditional crime drama genre, it has become increasingly difficult to find serious minded films that don't play as ""hip and ironic."" Add a young leading man to the equation, and it's twice as likely that you'll end up with a movie filled with artifice and self-awareness. In fact, reading the description of ""The Lookout,"" I was sure that this picture would be just another film where clever one-liners were more important than generating actual suspense and drama. I couldn't have been more wrong! ""The Lookout"" is a tough and believable entry in the arena of heist films. Bolstered by a powerful lead performance by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, this film is both true to the conventions of crime genre and surprisingly different. The film succeeds with strong character development and provides an intriguing twist on the traditional protagonist.Here, Gordon-Levitt plays a man coping with severe memory loss, control issues, and occasional motor skill inconsistencies. Sounds scary, huh? But don't worry, this is a real character dealing with real head trauma issues--not some cliche'd portrait or movie-of-the-week caricature. As a former ""golden boy,"" Gordon-Levitt struggles to adjust to his disability. But he's also trying to cope with a monstrous grief--the car accident that impaired him (he was driving) also resulted in the death of two others. One day, he meets a mysterious stranger who claims to know him and seems to accept him in his present condition. Excited to belong, to be normal--he is drawn into a new world of friendship, women, and living life free and on the edge. But he soon questions the motives of his new friend as he is pulled into a plot to rob the bank in which he works. What follows is a hard edged story with real consequences--a riveting and suspenseful drama made even stronger by its attention to characterization.Joseph Gordon-Levitt seems intent on becoming a serious thespian as opposed to just a big ""star."" With smart and unusual roles, he has certainly set himself apart from most actors in his age group. With ""Mysterious Skin,"" ""Brick,"" and now ""The Lookout""--Gordon-Levitt has put himself on a short list of performers who can be counted on to make interesting choices. These diverse performances demonstrate a great versatility, a willingness to take chances, and (most importantly) the opportunity to really showcase what a great actor he has become. But ""The Lookout"" also benefits from a great supporting cast. Jeff Daniels gives an understated, humorous and quietly moving performance as Gordon-Levitt's blind best friend. And I found Isla Fisher (""Wedding Crashers"") to be enchanting--complicit and innocent at the same time, what might have been a stereotypical role is refreshingly free of cliche.I thoroughly enjoyed ""The Lookout."" One small note--the skeptic in me wondered how Gordon-Levitt was mentally (not to mention legally) able to handle a car due to his circumstances. In all honesty, it's unlikely that he would have been licensed based on what happened and on his current state of health. But it's a small point in an otherwise exemplary film. Smart, tough, and unexpected--""The Lookout"" works as a caper, as a drama, and as a character study. A remarkably complex entry into what has become a fairly routine genre, this film packs an emotional punch and provides another great Gordon-Levitt performance!

Now he lives with his blind roommate Lewis (Jeff Daniels), goes to rehab classes, and works as a custodian at night.  Chris is lonely, and is happy when a ne'er-do-well ( Matthew Goode) befriends him,  but before he knows it, he's involved in a bank heist.Gordon-Levitt is such an interesting young actor.  He makes small indy movies (likeBrickandMysterious Skin) that are invariably well-made, memorable character studies.

Bernabo,"[3, 4]","Imitation is the supposedly the sincerest form of flattery but it seldom makes for a decent movie when Hollywood tries to capitalize on a successful film.  ""Pulp Fiction"" jumbled the chronological order of its scenes and other films followed suit, with no where either the notoriety or the success.  A film that succeeds ends up losing points for being imitative, which is what happened with ""Babel,"" a film that might have been nominated for an Oscar if, as David Spade would say, we had not seen it the year before when it was called ""Crash.""  The point of these extended prologue is that while I was watching ""The Lookout"" I was reminded of ""Memento,"" and while this 2007 film is neither as good nor as memorable, writer-director Scott Frank has come up with one of the more intelligent screenplays I have seen in a while, compelling me to round up on this film.  This is Frank's first time as a director, having previously written the screenplays forGet Shorty,"" ""Minority Report, and several other films adapted from novels.  With ""The Lookout,"" he proves he can be pretty original.""The Lookout"" begins with Chris Pratt (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a star high school hockey player in Kansas (really), who decides to impress a girl by driving down a country road with his headlights off at night so she can enjoy the beautiful fireflies.  Of course this is a bad idea and four years later Chris has short-term memory issues because of the traumatic brain injury he received that fateful night.  Chris has to use a notebook to keep his life ordered and is desperate to lead a normal life.  He lives with Lewis (Jeff Daniels), who is older and blind, and the unlikely pair apparently fill gaps in each other's life.  One night at a bar Chris is about to get ripped off by a bartender when he is rescued by Gary (Matthew Goode), who also introduces Chris to an ex-stripper named Luvlee Lemons (Isla Fisher).  Apparently they remember Chris was his golden days and seem willing to treat him like he is still the guy who was broken the night of the accident.  However, while Chris takes them at their word, we cannot, and our suspicions are confirmed when Gary recruits Chris to rob a bank.  Not just any bank, of course, but the one where Chris works as a janitor.  By this point in the film Gary is pushing all of the right buttons, and Chris agrees.The last act of the film consists of the bank robbery and its aftermath, and having set up the rules of Chris's life and the way his mind works (his major problem is with sequencing), Frank has also set up the payoff for his film.  The results are not brilliant, but they are also not predictable, which is why ""The Lookout"" is the most memorable film I have seen so far this month.  The moment where I decided that I really liked this movie comes during the robbery, where Frank avoids the commonplace of the local cop who does not know how to do his job.  I am so sick and tired of movies and television shows where the plot is advanced only by the blatant stupidity of a character.  Things get pretty bad in ""The Lookout,"" but the cop in question helps more than he hurts.  More importantly, when Chris remembers what his limitations are, he knows how to use them.  Frank also gets credit for assembling this cast on the strength of the script he had written.  I checked out this film because it had Jeff Daniels in it, but Gordon-Levitt provides the performance you remember from this one.  Again, this is not a great film (except for the opening scene Frank's strength here is clearly as a writer rather than as a director), but the fact it is pretty good makes it stand out and actually got me to recommend it to others more directly than by posting a review.",5,It is hard to rob a bank if you keep forgetting that is what you are doing,1192320000,"10 14, 2007",2007,3712,"['Imitation', 'supposedly', 'sincerest', 'form', 'flattery', 'seldom', 'decent', 'movie', 'when', 'Hollywood', 'capitalize', 'successful', 'film', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'jumbled', 'chronological', 'order', 'scenes', 'other', 'films', 'followed', 'suit', 'where', 'either', 'notoriety', 'success', 'film', 'up', 'losing', 'points', 'being', 'imitative', 'what', 'happened', 'Babel', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'David', 'Spade', 'would', 'say', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'year', 'when', 'was', 'called', 'Crash', 'point', 'extended', 'prologue', 'was', 'watching', 'Lookout', 'was', 'reminded', 'Memento', '2007', 'film', 'as', 'good', 'memorable', 'writer-director', 'Scott', 'Frank', 'come', 'up', 'one', 'more', 'intelligent', 'screenplays', 'have', 'seen', 'while', 'compelling', 'round', 'up', 'film', 'Frank', 'first', 'time', 'director', 'having', 'previously', 'written', 'screenplays', 'forGet', 'Shorty', 'Minority', 'Report', 'several', 'other', 'films', 'adapted', 'novels', 'Lookout', 'can', 'be', 'pretty', 'original', 'Lookout', 'Chris', 'Pratt', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'star', 'high', 'school', 'hockey', 'player', 'Kansas', 'really', 'who', 'impress', 'girl', 'driving', 'down', 'country', 'road', 'headlights', 'off', 'night', 'can', 'enjoy', 'beautiful', 'fireflies', 'course', 'bad', 'idea', 'four', 'years', 'later', 'Chris', 'short-term', 'memory', 'issues', 'traumatic', 'brain', 'injury', 'received', 'fateful', 'night', 'Chris', 'use', 'notebook', 'keep', 'life', 'ordered', 'desperate', 'lead', 'normal', 'life', 'Lewis', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'who', 'older', 'blind', 'unlikely', 'pair', 'apparently', 'fill', 'gaps', 'other', 'life', 'One', 'night', 'bar', 'Chris', 'get', 'ripped', 'off', 'bartender', 'when', 'rescued', 'Gary', 'Matthew', 'Goode', 'who', 'also', 'Chris', 'ex-stripper', 'named', 'Luvlee', 'Lemons', 'Isla', 'Fisher', 'Apparently', 'remember', 'Chris', 'was', 'golden', 'days', 'seem', 'willing', 'treat', 'still', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'broken', 'night', 'accident', 'However', 'Chris', 'word', 'can', 'not', 'suspicions', 'are', 'confirmed', 'when', 'Gary', 'Chris', 'rob', 'bank', 'Not', 'just', 'bank', 'course', 'one', 'where', 'Chris', 'janitor', 'point', 'film', 'Gary', 'pushing', 'right', 'buttons', 'Chris', 'agrees.The', 'last', 'act', 'film', 'bank', 'robbery', 'aftermath', 'having', 'set', 'up', 'rules', 'Chris', 'life', 'way', 'mind', 'works', 'major', 'problem', 'sequencing', 'Frank', 'also', 'set', 'up', 'payoff', 'film', 'results', 'are', 'not', 'brilliant', 'are', 'also', 'not', 'predictable', 'why', 'Lookout', 'most', 'memorable', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'month', 'moment', 'where', 'decided', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'robbery', 'where', 'Frank', 'commonplace', 'local', 'cop', 'who', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'do', 'job', 'am', 'so', 'sick', 'tired', 'movies', 'television', 'shows', 'where', 'plot', 'advanced', 'only', 'blatant', 'stupidity', 'character', 'Things', 'get', 'pretty', 'bad', 'Lookout', 'cop', 'question', 'more', 'More', 'importantly', 'when', 'Chris', 'what', 'limitations', 'are', 'how', 'use', 'Frank', 'also', 'credit', 'assembling', 'cast', 'strength', 'script', 'had', 'written', 'checked', 'out', 'film', 'had', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'performance', 'remember', 'one', 'Again', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'opening', 'scene', 'Frank', 'strength', 'here', 'clearly', 'writer', 'rather', 'director', 'fact', 'pretty', 'good', 'stand', 'out', 'actually', 'got', 'recommend', 'others', 'more', 'directly', 'posting', 'review']",N/A

The disappointing thing is, this could have been a very good or even a great movie.Film noir is it's thing, and like many people I am drawn to it.  Of course noir fans won't mind a slow moving story, which was no problem for me but might be for some.  But I particularly enjoy noir when it is used in a way that actually aids in the story.  In this case it seems to be used as an artifice.  The noir angle could have been further developed.The story line is hardly as ""unpredictable"" as some would have you believe.  It's actually so obvious that it's clear that the group's plans would never work.  The story is based on the often used formula of the young guy who ""had it all"" till an accident changed his life.  The accident is supposed to leave him damaged, but in my opinion the director under-portrayed the after effects to the point that they are not as powerful as they could have been.  A perfect example is the scene where he is hanging out with he newfound friends and lightly says ""now I remember why I am here"" to the girl who has caught his eye.  His condition is lightly played with, but the line is not framed effectively enough to be effective either in a subtle or an obvious way.Isla Fisher, ofWedding Crashersfame, is very cute and convincing in her role as the love interest.  But the real magic happens in the scene she shares with Daniels, who somewhat steals what Levitt leaves behind despite very few lines. I enjoyed Jeff Daniels portrayal a lot.  He definitely deserves more credit than he has gotten for this role.Of course he is the star, but how many noir films is Joseph Gordon Levitt going to star in?  Clearly he can act.  He carries a lot of this movie, with the help of a very good supporting castThe main problem with this film is the way all the plot lines are crudely tied together at the end.  It's not done effectively and it undermines a good portion of the first hour and change of the movie.  I am not one for spoilers so you will have to see it for yourself.  Ultimately, this is what made this movie just an OK movie instead of a very good one.  By the time you reach the climax and conclusion, you are bound to have several ""huh?"" moments.This is still worth watching and I personally find it to be much better thanBrick, though both are over-rated in my humble opinion.

And then one night he decides, with 3 other friends, to seek out a shower of fire flies on an empty Kansan highway when tragedy strikes and he is rendered impaired both mentally and physically. His life is now more about ""sequencing"": ordering his life in such a way so as to recall what he needs to do on a daily basis in order to survive. Chris's golden sheen is tarnished, dented and made worse by the fact that, though his memory is spotty, he unfortunately can recall the high points of his young life: winning the hockey championship, cruising the highway in his convertible Mustang with his beautiful girlfriend, Kelly who survives the accident and appears every so often as a touchstone plunging Chris back to that fateful evening under a clear, Kansan night sky.Chris works as a night janitor at a bank and it is this job that brings him in contact with some crooks (mainly an amazing, deadly Matthew Goode, heretofore known as eye candy in Mandy Moore movies...as Gary Spargo) who take advantage of Chris' impairments in order to rob the bank: ""Whoever has the money, has the power,"" Gary intones and this mantra will echo throughout the film.Director/Screenwriter (""Out of Sight"") Scott Frank audaciously centers the ""action"" on the who's/the why's and the where fore's of Chris' search for his basic morality: he's not the man he was before, this much is clear, this much is unassailable. So who is Chris now and more to the point how will he allow the accident to dictate his future: will he let it swallow up all that is good and humane in him...or will he not?""The Lookout"" is an effective, nail-biting at times, little thriller filled with the minutiae of lives well observed particularly that of Gordon-Levitt's masterful Chris: behind a veil made from the opaque cloth of befuddlement and embarrassment, he manages to project vulnerability and the injured remains of an ego he can only periodically recall.",4,The Weak Shall Inherit the Earth,1186704000,"08 10, 2007",2007,2076,"['Chris', 'Pratt', 'getting', 'better', 'role', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-', 'Levitt', 'was', 'golden', 'boy', 'high', 'school', 'Hockey', 'star', 'entitled', 'child', 'wealthy', 'parents', 'then', 'one', 'night', '3', 'other', 'friends', 'seek', 'out', 'shower', 'fire', 'flies', 'empty', 'Kansan', 'highway', 'when', 'tragedy', 'strikes', 'rendered', 'impaired', 'mentally', 'physically', 'life', 'now', 'more', 'sequencing', 'ordering', 'life', 'such', 'way', 'so', 'recall', 'what', 'do', 'daily', 'basis', 'order', 'survive', 'Chris', 'golden', 'sheen', 'tarnished', 'dented', 'made', 'worse', 'fact', 'memory', 'spotty', 'unfortunately', 'can', 'recall', 'high', 'points', 'young', 'life', 'winning', 'hockey', 'championship', 'cruising', 'highway', 'convertible', 'Mustang', 'beautiful', 'girlfriend', 'Kelly', 'who', 'accident', 'so', 'often', 'touchstone', 'plunging', 'Chris', 'back', 'fateful', 'evening', 'clear', 'Kansan', 'night', 'sky.Chris', 'night', 'janitor', 'bank', 'job', 'contact', 'crooks', 'mainly', 'amazing', 'deadly', 'Matthew', 'Goode', 'heretofore', 'known', 'eye', 'candy', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'movies', 'Gary', 'Spargo', 'who', 'take', 'advantage', 'Chris', 'impairments', 'order', 'rob', 'bank', 'money', 'power', 'Gary', 'intones', 'mantra', 'will', 'echo', 'film.Director/Screenwriter', 'Sight', 'Scott', 'Frank', 'audaciously', 'action', ""who's/the"", 'why', 'where', 'fore', 'Chris', 'search', 'basic', 'morality', 'not', 'man', 'was', 'before', 'much', 'clear', 'much', 'unassailable', 'who', 'Chris', 'now', 'more', 'point', 'how', 'will', 'allow', 'accident', 'dictate', 'future', 'will', 'let', 'swallow', 'up', 'good', 'humane', 'will', 'not', 'Lookout', 'effective', 'nail-biting', 'times', 'little', 'thriller', 'filled', 'minutiae', 'lives', 'well', 'observed', 'particularly', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'masterful', 'Chris', 'veil', 'made', 'opaque', 'cloth', 'befuddlement', 'embarrassment', 'project', 'vulnerability', 'injured', 'remains', 'ego', 'can', 'only', 'periodically', 'recall']",N/A

Chris is your cool, tough, good looking, athletic, popular kid from a wealthy family with everything going for him who likes to push the limits.  At the beginning of the movie Chris shuts off the lights of his car to show his girlfriend the lightening bugs with two other friends in the backseat and a bad car accident takes place.Now four years later Chris has all kinds of complications from the crash from his memory to his functions and thought process.  Chris lives with Lewis played by Jeff Daniels who is blind.  Daniels also does a great job and his character is funny and charismatic as he tells a joke at Chris's family's thanksgiving dinner, What do you call a mushroom that walks into a bar and buys everyone a drink? I don't know. A fungi (fun guy).  Also his idea to open up a restaurant called Lew's Your Lunch because his name is Lewis.  Lewis is a genuine good guy who cares about Chris.So, this star hockey player that was good at everything now works cleaning a bank.  One night at a bar Chris is approached by Gary Spargo a con man that wants to use Chris's access at the bank.  Chris is hesitant but wants his old life back like Gary says he can't give that to him but can give him power because whoever has the money has the power.  Chris's selfishness, frivolity, and unappreciative  way of looking at life makes him seem like the blind one and not Lewis.  After this unfortunate accident that took Chris's previous life he is still lucky enough to be surrounded by good honest people like Lewis, the Cop/family man who brings him donuts and checks up on him, and the people he works with.  Will Chris turn the lights on this time around before it's too late?The film has good performances all around and is a great crime story that keeps you interested from start to finish.  Scott Frank who wrote this makes his directing debut, he originally wrote this script for David Fincher to direct but ended up doing it himself and does a great job.  Frank has also written such scripts as Get Shorty, Minority Report, and Out of Sight.  In an interview with Evan Jacobs of Movieweb Evan asks ""What would you like viewers to take away from watching The Lookout?Scott Frank: I just want them to feel like they were told a good story. That to me is the most important thing, that they feel like they watched a story well told. Nothing would make me happier than people being engrossed in the story.

1075793,A1FG91CM8221X1,B000QFCD8Q,Miles D. Moore,"[3, 6]","""The Lookout,"" Scott Frank's debut as a director, is a thoroughly professional, thrilling film noir; one would expect nothing less from the screenwriter of ""Dead Again,"" ""Get Shorty,"" and ""Out of Sight."" In thinking about the film after seeing it, however, I grew more and more impressed with the depth of its characterizations and its treatment of disabled characters not as plot points or plaster saints, but as fully fleshed, three-dimensional people. Chris Pratt (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a former high-school athlete and all-around Golden Boy, is still picking up the pieces of his life four years after a horrible auto accident. Afflicted with a brain injury that makes it difficult for him to sequence his thoughts, he must write down all his daily activities in order, in a notepad, even to the point of remembering to use soap in the shower and not to lock his keys in his car. Afflicted with unbearable feelings of rage, guilt, and loss, Chris is an easy mark for the friendly attentions of Gary (Matthew Goode), who claims to have been a classmate of Chris' older sister, and Gary's ex-stripper girlfriend Luvlee (Isla Fisher), who comes on to Chris immediately. At once we sense that Gary's interest is less in Chris and more in the bank in which Chris works as night janitor. The story is of how Gary sucks Chris into the heist, and how later Chris must overcome his disabilities to save himself and those he cares about. As director and screenwriter, Frank is a master of building suspense, slowly and almost imperceptibly, to palm-sweating intensity. But, even more, he is extremely astute in creating characters, and in choosing and directing actors to play them. Joseph Gordon-Levitt has become something of a specialist in playing damaged characters, and ""The Lookout"" continues the impressive string of performances he created in ""Manic,"" ""Mysterious Skin,"" and ""Brick."" From the jerky, limping gait he gives Chris to the barely perceptible movements of his eyes, Gordon-Levitt creates an unforgettable, deeply moving character in Chris, one we root for all the way. Matthew Goode, on the other hand, transcends the bland pretty boys he played in ""Match Point"" and other films, playing Gary as a charming but suspiciously oily con man at the beginning and slowly revealing him to be a seething, murderous sociopath. It's a performance of great intensity and skill. Also outstanding is the great Jeff Daniels as Lewis, Chris' roommate and only close friend. Lewis is blind, but he's a most unusual blind man for the movies; gruff, sardonic and profane, he reveals great depths of wisdom, kindness and courage without the slightest whiff of the plaster sanctity with which Hollywood loves to coat the blind. ""The Lookout"" is superbly acted down to the smallest bit part; besides the aforementioned actors, I particularly loved Sergio Di Zio as Ted, the hapless, good-natured cop who befriends Chris and brings him doughnuts. ""The Lookout"" isn't quite perfect; for example, one major character disappears halfway through with no real explanation. (That character's disappearance is logical and even foreshadowed when you think about it, but some may think the matter requires more thought than it's worth.) However, the totality of the film is so impressive that its flaws are negligible. Some may object that Chris in ""The Lookout"" is too close to Leonard in ""Memento,"" and insist as a consequence that the film's ending is unbelievable. Chris, however, is much more fleshed out than Leonard, and his brain injury isn't the same; Chris is capable of sustained thought, he simply has to unscramble his thoughts. ""The Lookout"" is a movie you'll want to see more than once--and to tell your friends about.",5,"A compelling film noir, with unusual twists.",1175299200,"03 31, 2007",2007,3717,"['Lookout', 'Scott', 'Frank', 'debut', 'director', 'thoroughly', 'professional', 'thrilling', 'film', 'noir', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'nothing', 'screenwriter', 'Dead', 'Again', 'Get', 'Shorty', 'Out', 'Sight', 'thinking', 'film', 'seeing', 'however', 'grew', 'more', 'more', 'impressed', 'depth', 'characterizations', 'treatment', 'disabled', 'characters', 'not', 'plot', 'points', 'plaster', 'saints', 'fully', 'fleshed', 'three-dimensional', 'people', 'Chris', 'Pratt', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'former', 'high-school', 'athlete', 'all-around', 'Golden', 'Boy', 'still', 'picking', 'up', 'pieces', 'life', 'four', 'years', 'horrible', 'auto', 'accident', 'Afflicted', 'brain', 'injury', 'difficult', 'sequence', 'thoughts', 'must', 'write', 'down', 'daily', 'activities', 'order', 'notepad', 'even', 'point', 'remembering', 'use', 'soap', 'shower', 'not', 'lock', 'keys', 'car', 'Afflicted', 'unbearable', 'feelings', 'rage', 'guilt', 'loss', 'Chris', 'easy', 'mark', 'friendly', 'attentions', 'Gary', 'Matthew', 'Goode', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'classmate', 'Chris', 'older', 'sister', 'Gary', 'ex-stripper', 'girlfriend', 'Luvlee', 'Isla', 'Fisher', 'who', 'Chris', 'immediately', 'once', 'sense', 'Gary', 'interest', 'less', 'Chris', 'more', 'bank', 'Chris', 'night', 'janitor', 'story', 'how', 'Gary', 'sucks', 'Chris', 'heist', 'how', 'later', 'Chris', 'must', 'overcome', 'disabilities', 'save', 'about', 'director', 'screenwriter', 'Frank', 'master', 'building', 'suspense', 'slowly', 'almost', 'imperceptibly', 'palm-sweating', 'intensity', 'even', 'more', 'extremely', 'astute', 'creating', 'characters', 'choosing', 'directing', 'actors', 'play', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'become', 'something', 'specialist', 'playing', 'damaged', 'characters', 'Lookout', 'impressive', 'string', 'performances', 'created', 'Manic', 'Mysterious', 'Skin', 'Brick', 'jerky', 'limping', 'gait', 'Chris', 'barely', 'perceptible', 'movements', 'eyes', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'unforgettable', 'deeply', 'moving', 'character', 'Chris', 'one', 'root', 'way', 'Matthew', 'Goode', 'other', 'hand', 'bland', 'pretty', 'played', 'Match', 'Point', 'other', 'films', 'playing', 'Gary', 'charming', 'suspiciously', 'oily', 'con', 'man', 'beginning', 'slowly', 'revealing', 'be', 'seething', 'murderous', 'sociopath', 'performance', 'great', 'intensity', 'skill', 'Also', 'outstanding', 'great', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'Lewis', 'Chris', 'roommate', 'only', 'close', 'friend', 'Lewis', 'blind', 'most', 'unusual', 'blind', 'man', 'movies', 'gruff', 'sardonic', 'profane', 'great', 'depths', 'wisdom', 'kindness', 'courage', 'slightest', 'whiff', 'plaster', 'sanctity', 'Hollywood', 'coat', 'blind', 'Lookout', 'superbly', 'acted', 'down', 'smallest', 'bit', 'part', 'aforementioned', 'actors', 'particularly', 'loved', 'Sergio', 'Di', 'Zio', 'Ted', 'hapless', 'good-natured', 'cop', 'who', 'Chris', 'doughnuts', 'Lookout', ""n't"", 'quite', 'perfect', 'example', 'one', 'major', 'character', 'halfway', 'real', 'explanation', 'character', 'disappearance', 'logical', 'even', 'foreshadowed', 'when', 'think', 'may', 'think', 'matter', 'more', 'thought', 'worth', 'However', 'totality', 'film', 'so', 'impressive', 'flaws', 'are', 'negligible', 'may', 'object', 'Chris', 'Lookout', 'too', 'close', 'Leonard', 'Memento', 'insist', 'consequence', 'film', 'ending', 'unbelievable', 'Chris', 'however', 'much', 'more', 'fleshed', 'out', 'Leonard', 'brain', 'injury', ""n't"", 'same', 'Chris', 'capable', 'sustained', 'thought', 'simply', 'unscramble', 'thoughts', 'Lookout', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'want', 'see', 'more', 'once', 'tell', 'friends']",N/A

That's the only fault I find with this otherwise impressive directorial debut by screenwriter Scott Frank. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is one of the most charismatic actors working in film. Chris struggles with his limitations, with powerlessness, and most of all, with the aching memory of what he once was. And we root for him. Cinematographer Alar Kivilo has done a wonderful job of recreating the bleak Kansas winter landscape that accentuates Chris' isolation. Chris' cognitive problems are somehow a more compelling obstacle than thrillers or character dramas usually offer. Fans of both genres won't want to miss ""The Lookout"".The DVD (Miramax 2007): ""Behind the Mind of Chris Pratt"" (9 min) primarily features Joseph Gordon-Levitt discussing Chris and how he prepared to portray someone with a brain injury. ""Sequencing The Lookout"" (20 min) interviews Scott Frank and the producers about the inspirations for the script, themes, and the actors. Production designer David Brisbin talks about locations in Canada, and the cast is interviewed. There is an audio commentary by writer/director Scott Frank and cinematographer Alar Kivilo.

Where was the buzz about this film? It came out last year, and I'd honestly hardly heard of it until a few weeks ago.Chris Pratt (Gordon-Levitt) is a popular high school student. His family is wealthy, he's the star of the school hockey team, and he's dating a beautiful girl. A horrific car accident, however, leaves him with a serious brain injury (that he's still trying to cope with) and two deaths on his conscience. After much rehab, Chris is living a lonely life as the night janitor at a bank. He lives in an apartment with Lewis (Daniels), a blind man with an eccentric personality.Having a non-alcoholic beer at a local bar one night, Chris is approached by Gary Spargo (Goode), who apparently went to high school with him. Spargo befriends him, introducing Chris to Luvlee Lemons (Fisher), with whom he strikes up a romantic relationship. Before long, though, the jig is up. Chris realizes that Gary is only softening him up in order to gain his participation in a robbery of the bank. With Gary's persuasion of power and a better life, Chris agrees to help.Gordon-Levitt is amazing in this film, and the script is a thing of beauty. Daniels plays a role different from what I'm used to seeing him in, and he does very well with it. I was impressed with this film, and particularly with the character of Chris.I am normally the person in the audience shouting at characters that make bad decisions. (As in, ""Noooooo! You KNOW that is wrong! What are you doing??!! Stop! Stop right now and walk out of there!) But with this film, it is not so easy to judge. Chris had everything. And now he feels that he has nothing. And he can't concentrate. And he can't even cook for himself, because he can't seem to put all the pieces together needed to open cans of tomatoes, boil pasta water, etc. He has lost so much. And he's still so young. And Gary comes in, smooth-talker that he is, and Chris wants so badly to believe that he can recapture who he was that he falls for it. I totally understood why Chris would have participated in the heist. I couldn't blame him.This is not a predictable script. I honestly didn't know what would happen next.

1075808,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B000QFCD8Q,RMurray847,"[8, 10]","First of all, let me say that the best reason to see this film is to enjoy the nuanced, assured performance from Joseph Gordon Levitt.  He has now totally left 3RD ROCK (on which he was very good) behind, and can now be taken totally seriously as a film actor.  As the star of THE LOOKOUT, he's forced to play a person who is something of a cypher (due to the horrific accident in the first scene of the film that leaves him a shell of a man, MEMENTO-like).  He's trying to rediscover himself, his motivations and his personality.  Yet Levitt never just puts on a blank face and let's that act for him (Tobey Maguire anyone?).  You can see his mind working, his wheels SLOWLY grinding if you will.  It's a subtle work, and he makes his character very sympathetic.  And this is an important accomplishment, because if we can't look past his faults (which are deep and considerable) we can't get caught up in rooting for him.The script is the next best thing.  It's an inventive story.  Some call it a heist movie...but truthfully, the heist is really only a small part of the film and isn't even mentioned until nearly the midway point of the film.  It's a dark film, but it's not a crime film.  While the idea of a character with severe memory problems is not totally original (again, MEMENTO springs to mind), it does get a grittier take.  It's less concerned with using the memory problems to have clever temporal surprises...it's interested in seeing how these problems eat away at Levitt.  This is the heart of the film.Jeff Daniels plays Levitt's roommate, a blind man who serves as friend, advisor and sometime moral compass.  Again, the part could be one-dimensional...but Daniels never gives easy or uninteresting performances.  He isn't always in great films...but he's always terrific himself.My biggest complaint about the movie is the ""bad guys.""  Their motivations aren't as developed as Levitt's.  They seem a little bit generic.  They are amazingly stupid...which is actually believable...but they are only sketchy in their menance.  Certainly, we hate them and root against them...but they aren't fascinating.  Isla Fisher plays Levitt's ""love interest,"" whose motivations are far from pure...and while she is a beguiling presence...her character is underwritten.Despite these weaknesses, the movie is quite tense, and the final 15 minutes or so, when the heist plays out...are pretty DARN TENSE indeed.  I was on the edge of my seat.  And while the ending isn't quite a stunner...it DOES have a quiet power...just like the rest of this off-beat, dark and highly original little film.

1075809,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000QFCD8Q,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 4]","Joseph Gordon-Levitt specializes in playing ""damaged"" characters.  In the magnificent ""Mysterious Skin,"" he portrayed a young man struggling to come to terms with the sexual abuse he experienced as a child.  In ""The Lookout,"" he plays a man coping with the mental impairment he suffered as the result of a car accident in high school (an accident for which he was largely responsible and which claimed the lives of two of the other people in the car and seriously injured a third).  Chris Pratt spends most of his days just trying to keep the simplest facts of life straight in his head.  Daily activities and chores that the rest of us take for granted become monumental tasks for Chris.  Once a promising, star hockey player in high school, Chris now works the nightshift as a janitor in a Kansas City bank and lives with the blind buddy (Jeff Daniels) he met while undergoing physical therapy.One fateful night, Chris is approached by Gary Spargo, a criminal lowlife who befriends Chris in order to rope him into acting as ""lookout"" while he and his cronies rob the bank where he works.  Thus, Chris is forced to make a serious moral choice, despite the fact that the world itself doesn't make all that much sense to him anymore.Written and directed by Scott Frank, ""The Lookout"" starts off with a fascinating premise to which it remains faithful to the end.  Given the raw material, the film could easily have become melodramatic, sentimental or preachy in its approach.  Instead, the movie gathers the strands of its narrative with precision and care, letting us get to know Chris in the context of his family, his friends and the routines of his daily life before moving on with the story itself.  Gordon-Levitt's winsome face is like a beacon drawing us into the soul of the character, making us empathize with his plight without ever asking us to feel sorry for or pity him (it`s hard to believe he once played the nerdy neighbor in ""Roseanne."").  Like so many of us, Chris is an individual who acts foolishly and recklessly in his youth, but, unlike most of us, who can laughingly brush off such actions as mere ""youthful indiscretions,""  Chris is forced to live with the consequences of those actions for the rest of his life.  For beyond his own impairment, he also has to struggle with the guilt of knowing he caused the deaths and/or injuries of three innocent people, one of them his best friend.In his handling of the relationship between Chris and an attractive former dancer who goes by the name of Luvlee Lemons, Frank shows an ability to write complex characters and a willingness to leave certain plot points unresolved if that makes the tale itself more believable.  Like Chris, we can never get a clear fix on the type of person Luvlee truly is.  Is she a coldhearted manipulator pretending to be interested in Chris just to hook him into the robbery scheme, or is she genuinely drawn to him despite her ulterior motives?

1075815,A2IG2FG7L85RMU,B000QFCD8Q,Stanley H. Nemeth,"[2, 5]","This movie is being praised to the rafters by newspaper reviewers for two reasons: the quality of its screenplay and that of its acting. While both have merit, I'd argue they each have serious limitations. As for the screenplay, it's exciting at the outset and then again in the explosive bank heist scenes, but the intervening period is largely filled with a slow-moving, repetitive presentation of the incapacities afflicting former high school athlete Chris (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), and these descend, unfortunately, into dullness. Even worse is the denouement and its resolution of the Gordon-Levitt-Jeff Daniels ""dream,"" pure Hollywood schlock by the screenwriter, if I've ever seen it. Finally, the likelihood of rich-boy Chris' sharing an apartment in a rundown neighborhood with an older, good-as-gold blind man is highly improbable to say the least. It smacks not so much of suitably gritty, film noir realism as that of a more recent, widely preferred, unrealistic Hollywood genre, the slum pastoral. In this, we have innocent characters moving through areas where experience and judgment lead us least to expect them. Eminem's ""8 Mile"" is perhaps the progenitor of this genre.The acting, though largely commendable, is of an awfully limited sort. Gordon-Levitt, like Dustin Hoffmann in ""Rain Man"" and Daniel Day Lewis in ""My Left Foot"", is playing the kind of role that demands less from the actor in intellectual and emotional variety than it does from the audience in free-floating compassion for the afflicted. Gordon-Levitt, for my money, has already done better work in more challenging parts, though his role here is of the sort that self-congratulatory, ""feeling"" Hollywood loves come award time. Jeff Daniels, too, never gives a bad performance, though his role, as the incessantly wise-cracking, blind sidekick, is here one-dimensional as well. All in all, this film is an entertainment with some merit, though it's not the revelation that professional reviewers, ever Argus-eyed for new features of mark, have united in chorus to declare it.",3,"""Overrated""",1175990400,"04 8, 2007",2007,2061,"['movie', 'being', 'praised', 'rafters', 'newspaper', 'reviewers', 'two', 'reasons', 'quality', 'screenplay', 'acting', 'have', 'merit', ""'d"", 'argue', 'have', 'serious', 'limitations', 'screenplay', 'exciting', 'outset', 'then', 'again', 'explosive', 'bank', 'heist', 'scenes', 'intervening', 'period', 'largely', 'filled', 'slow-moving', 'repetitive', 'presentation', 'incapacities', 'afflicting', 'former', 'high', 'school', 'athlete', 'Chris', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'descend', 'unfortunately', 'dullness', 'Even', 'worse', 'denouement', 'resolution', 'Gordon-Levitt-Jeff', 'Daniels', 'dream', 'pure', 'Hollywood', 'schlock', 'screenwriter', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Finally', 'likelihood', 'rich-boy', 'Chris', 'sharing', 'apartment', 'rundown', 'neighborhood', 'older', 'good-as-gold', 'blind', 'man', 'highly', 'improbable', 'say', 'least', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'suitably', 'gritty', 'film', 'noir', 'realism', 'more', 'recent', 'widely', 'preferred', 'unrealistic', 'Hollywood', 'genre', 'slum', 'pastoral', 'have', 'innocent', 'characters', 'moving', 'areas', 'where', 'experience', 'judgment', 'lead', 'least', 'expect', 'Eminem', '8', 'Mile', 'perhaps', 'progenitor', 'genre.The', 'acting', 'largely', 'commendable', 'awfully', 'limited', 'sort', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'Dustin', 'Hoffmann', 'Rain', 'Man', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'Left', 'Foot', 'playing', 'kind', 'role', 'less', 'actor', 'intellectual', 'emotional', 'variety', 'audience', 'free-floating', 'compassion', 'afflicted', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'money', 'already', 'done', 'better', 'work', 'more', 'challenging', 'parts', 'role', 'here', 'sort', 'self-congratulatory', 'feeling', 'Hollywood', 'come', 'award', 'time', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'too', 'never', 'bad', 'performance', 'role', 'incessantly', 'wise-cracking', 'blind', 'sidekick', 'here', 'one-dimensional', 'well', 'film', 'entertainment', 'merit', 'not', 'revelation', 'professional', 'reviewers', 'ever', 'Argus-eyed', 'new', 'features', 'mark', 'have', 'united', 'chorus', 'declare']",N/A

Flash forward four years and we see Chris who grew up in affluence and was an outstanding hockey player now working as a small town bank janitor with a memory so badly impaired that he needs notes and reminders to carry out many simple tasks.

1075819,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B000QFCD8Q,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[11, 16]","The Lookout is a compelling heist flick mixed with ""Memento""-like memory loss, glued together by a film noir tone and narrative. There are a few too many loopholes in the storyline and an undefined set of rules regarding the main character's brain damage, but Jeff Daniels' supporting character Lewis comes to the rescue, nudging the film slightly above the average mark. An unparagoned idea, The Lookout simply doesn't piece together smoothly.Chris Pratt (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) had a normal life, lots of friends, admiration and popularity. After a particularly stupid mistake in which he was showing off to his girlfriend while driving, he wrecks his car, killing two people and ending up in a coma. Years later he suffers from the inability to form new short-term memories, and must slowly train himself to do everyday activities through constant repetition and note-taking. An old friend, Gary Spargo (Matthew Goode) approaches the lonely Chris to help him rob the local bank, and rapidly Chris finds himself caught in a dangerous heist that is sure cost him the lives of loved ones.The most questionable flaw with The Lookout is its inconsistencies with Chris's memory loss. He must use notes to wake up, take a shower (with soap), eat breakfast and go off to school. He gets easily confused and angered at little things, such as finding and operating a can opener. And yet he drives himself everywhere. If he can't remember how to use a can opener, how can he possibly remember how to drive a car? Is a car something you never forget how to operate? And throughout the film he even drives multiple vehicles. As far as memory loss portrayal goes, it's deficient and utterly unconvincing.The greatest redeeming factor in The Lookout is the brilliant performance by Jeff Daniels. His character, Lewis, is blind and ornery, suspicious and caring, has an overwhelming sense of individuality and insight and provides the majority of comedy relief. He's Chris's watchdog and guardian as well as his best friend. He is the most intelligent and well-crafted character in the film and easily the most likable. His thoughts on storytelling, ""You can't tell a story if you don't know where it's going,"" is a theme that guides Chris's actions, as well as influences the order of narrative events for the film. Without Daniels' shockingly heartfelt portrayal, there would be nothing else to fall back on when the uncertain story begins to feel too conventional. Joseph Gordon Levitt's performance is terribly average, and Isla Fisher is little more than eye candy.The music early on in the film is a stark contrast to the mood set once the heist is planned, and at several points the lighthearted score doesn't match. While some films use contrasting music to create a sense of displacement or for ironic inconsistencies, this feels simply like error. Like the music, the action is a bit too dark and ambiguous, almost as if the director is trying very intently to disguise the fact that he doesn't know how to shoot action sequences. Dark and confusing, the action scene cinematography does help to instill the idea that nothing ever goes as planned in these types of felonious storylines.Written and directed by Scott Frank (in his directorial debut), the special features on the disc discuss some of what went into making the film. ""Sequencing The Lookout"" is a making-of featurette conversing with the cast and crew some of the basic filmmaking processes. Frank mentions his association with someone who had had a head injury and woke up a figuratively different person, and the idea that the film is based on reality and yet Levitt did not pattern his acting around a particular person. Frank's visual style is heavily influenced by European thrillers, and the commentary track features both the director Scott Frank and director of photography Alar Kivilo. Also included is a featurette called ""Behind the Mind of Chris Pratt"" in which Joseph Gordon Levitt discusses the complexity and difficulty in playing his role.While the film employs too many loosely resolved plot points, and an ill-defined memory-loss ploy that is arguably faulty, The Lookout is not bad entertainment; it's simply average.- Mike Massie",3,The Lookout Movie Review,1187049600,"08 14, 2007",2007,4209,"['Lookout', 'compelling', 'heist', 'flick', 'mixed', 'Memento', 'memory', 'loss', 'glued', 'together', 'film', 'noir', 'tone', 'narrative', 'are', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'loopholes', 'storyline', 'undefined', 'set', 'rules', 'regarding', 'main', 'character', 'brain', 'damage', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'supporting', 'character', 'Lewis', 'rescue', 'nudging', 'film', 'slightly', 'average', 'mark', 'unparagoned', 'idea', 'Lookout', 'simply', ""n't"", 'piece', 'together', 'smoothly.Chris', 'Pratt', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'had', 'normal', 'life', 'lots', 'friends', 'admiration', 'popularity', 'particularly', 'stupid', 'mistake', 'was', 'showing', 'off', 'girlfriend', 'driving', 'car', 'killing', 'two', 'people', 'ending', 'up', 'coma', 'Years', 'later', 'inability', 'form', 'new', 'short-term', 'memories', 'must', 'slowly', 'train', 'do', 'everyday', 'activities', 'constant', 'repetition', 'note-taking', 'old', 'friend', 'Gary', 'Spargo', 'Matthew', 'Goode', 'lonely', 'Chris', 'help', 'rob', 'local', 'bank', 'rapidly', 'Chris', 'caught', 'dangerous', 'heist', 'sure', 'cost', 'lives', 'loved', 'ones.The', 'most', 'questionable', 'flaw', 'Lookout', 'inconsistencies', 'Chris', 'memory', 'loss', 'must', 'use', 'notes', 'wake', 'up', 'take', 'shower', 'soap', 'eat', 'breakfast', 'go', 'off', 'school', 'easily', 'confused', 'angered', 'little', 'things', 'such', 'finding', 'operating', 'can', 'opener', 'yet', 'everywhere', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'how', 'use', 'can', 'opener', 'how', 'can', 'possibly', 'remember', 'how', 'drive', 'car', 'car', 'something', 'never', 'forget', 'how', 'operate', 'film', 'even', 'multiple', 'vehicles', 'As', 'far', 'memory', 'loss', 'portrayal', 'deficient', 'utterly', 'unconvincing.The', 'greatest', 'redeeming', 'factor', 'Lookout', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'character', 'Lewis', 'blind', 'ornery', 'suspicious', 'caring', 'overwhelming', 'sense', 'individuality', 'insight', 'majority', 'comedy', 'relief', 'Chris', 'watchdog', 'guardian', 'as', 'well', 'best', 'friend', 'most', 'intelligent', 'well-crafted', 'character', 'film', 'easily', 'most', 'likable', 'thoughts', 'storytelling', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'going', 'theme', 'Chris', 'actions', 'as', 'well', 'influences', 'order', 'narrative', 'events', 'film', 'Daniels', 'shockingly', 'heartfelt', 'portrayal', 'would', 'be', 'nothing', 'else', 'fall', 'back', 'when', 'uncertain', 'story', 'feel', 'too', 'conventional', 'Joseph', 'Gordon', 'Levitt', 'performance', 'terribly', 'average', 'Isla', 'Fisher', 'little', 'more', 'eye', 'candy.The', 'music', 'early', 'film', 'stark', 'contrast', 'mood', 'set', 'once', 'heist', 'planned', 'several', 'points', 'lighthearted', 'score', ""n't"", 'match', 'films', 'use', 'contrasting', 'music', 'create', 'sense', 'displacement', 'ironic', 'inconsistencies', 'simply', 'like', 'error', 'music', 'action', 'bit', 'too', 'dark', 'ambiguous', 'almost', 'director', 'trying', 'very', 'intently', 'disguise', 'fact', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'shoot', 'action', 'sequences', 'Dark', 'confusing', 'action', 'scene', 'cinematography', 'help', 'instill', 'idea', 'nothing', 'ever', 'as', 'planned', 'types', 'felonious', 'storylines.Written', 'directed', 'Scott', 'Frank', 'directorial', 'debut', 'special', 'features', 'disc', 'what', 'went', 'making', 'film', 'Sequencing', 'Lookout', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'conversing', 'cast', 'crew', 'basic', 'filmmaking', 'processes', 'Frank', 'association', 'someone', 'who', 'had', 'had', 'head', 'injury', 'woke', 'up', 'figuratively', 'different', 'person', 'idea', 'film', 'based', 'reality', 'yet', 'Levitt', 'did', 'not', 'pattern', 'acting', 'particular', 'person', 'Frank', 'visual', 'style', 'heavily', 'influenced', 'European', 'thrillers', 'commentary', 'track', 'director', 'Scott', 'Frank', 'director', 'photography', 'Alar', 'Kivilo', 'Also', 'included', 'featurette', 'called', 'Mind', 'Chris', 'Pratt', 'Joseph', 'Gordon', 'Levitt', 'complexity', 'difficulty', 'playing', 'role.While', 'film', 'too', 'many', 'loosely', 'resolved', 'plot', 'points', 'ill-defined', 'memory-loss', 'ploy', 'arguably', 'faulty', 'Lookout', 'not', 'bad', 'entertainment', 'simply', 'average.-', 'Mike', 'Massie']",N/A

It stars the brilliantly versatile Joseph Gordon-Levitt (just made `Looper' and so many more great films) as Chris Pratt. He was a promising ice hockey player and then one night whilst out with his girl friend and two bestest mates, he totals his car killing the friends and badly injuring Kelly. He wakes up some time later and has suffered brain damage. He now can not do sequencing so needs to write things down in a note book, all the time. He sometimes forgets things, gets angry and swears and can find everyday tasks impossible to do.He lives with his blind friend Lewis, (the always excellent Jeff Daniels also `Looper and my fave `Gettysburg') who is far more capable than Chris. He works as a night janitor at a country bank but his wealthy father still picks up the bills for major items. Chris just wants his old life back, but finds it hard to even open a can of tomatoes. Then as luck would have it he runs into a guy who was above him at school and he seems to really like him and even gets him to meet ex erotic dancer Luvlee Lemons (Isla Fisher who plays it with aplomb).Soon he finds out why they are really interested in him and the title of the film is a bit of a clue. What we have here is an understated gem of a movie. It is a story of regret, failure, loss, love and realising what really matters in life and it is done in such a way that it all comes across as really believable. Alex Borstein appears as bank clerk Mrs Lange and `Family Guy' aficionados out there will know she is the voice of Lois Griffin, just a small part here though.I really enjoyed this film and was going for 5 stars as I am a bit of a fan of both Mr Daniels and Mr Gordon-Levitt so was prone to be biased, but in a pique of objective restraint I went for 4 as this is good, even ruddy good but not excellent . I often hear criticisms of Hollywood but there is a role for most films and ones like this prove how good American cinema can be, in both its originality and high production values, heck they even use `My Morning Jacket' as the musical intro. Seriously recommended and I still want to up this to 5, so please think 4 and a bit.",4,Brain Damaged Guy in Bank Heist Thriller.,1360627200,"02 12, 2013",2013,2239,"['one', 'films', 'slipped', 'radar', 'think', 'deserves', 'more', 'attention', 'brilliantly', 'versatile', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'just', 'made', 'Looper', 'so', 'many', 'more', 'great', 'films', 'Chris', 'Pratt', 'was', 'promising', 'ice', 'hockey', 'player', 'then', 'one', 'night', 'out', 'girl', 'friend', 'two', 'bestest', 'mates', 'car', 'killing', 'friends', 'badly', 'injuring', 'Kelly', 'up', 'time', 'later', 'suffered', 'brain', 'damage', 'now', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'sequencing', 'so', 'write', 'things', 'down', 'note', 'book', 'time', 'sometimes', 'things', 'angry', 'swears', 'can', 'find', 'everyday', 'tasks', 'impossible', 'do.He', 'lives', 'blind', 'friend', 'Lewis', 'always', 'excellent', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'also', 'Looper', 'fave', 'Gettysburg', 'who', 'far', 'more', 'capable', 'Chris', 'night', 'janitor', 'country', 'bank', 'wealthy', 'father', 'still', 'up', 'bills', 'major', 'items', 'Chris', 'just', 'old', 'life', 'back', 'hard', 'even', 'open', 'can', 'tomatoes', 'Then', 'luck', 'would', 'have', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'school', 'really', 'like', 'even', 'meet', 'ex', 'erotic', 'dancer', 'Luvlee', 'Lemons', 'Isla', 'Fisher', 'who', 'aplomb', '.Soon', 'out', 'why', 'are', 'really', 'interested', 'title', 'film', 'bit', 'clue', 'What', 'have', 'here', 'understated', 'gem', 'movie', 'story', 'regret', 'failure', 'loss', 'love', 'realising', 'what', 'really', 'matters', 'life', 'done', 'such', 'way', 'across', 'really', 'believable', 'Alex', 'Borstein', 'bank', 'clerk', 'Mrs', 'Lange', 'Family', 'Guy', 'aficionados', 'there', 'will', 'know', 'voice', 'Lois', 'Griffin', 'just', 'small', 'part', 'here', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'was', 'going', '5', 'stars', 'am', 'bit', 'fan', 'Mr', 'Daniels', 'Mr', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'so', 'was', 'prone', 'be', 'biased', 'pique', 'objective', 'restraint', 'went', '4', 'good', 'even', 'ruddy', 'good', 'not', 'excellent', 'often', 'hear', 'criticisms', 'Hollywood', 'role', 'most', 'films', 'ones', 'prove', 'how', 'good', 'American', 'cinema', 'can', 'be', 'originality', 'high', 'production', 'values', 'heck', 'even', 'use', 'Morning', 'Jacket', 'musical', 'intro', 'Seriously', 'recommended', 'still', 'want', 'up', '5', 'so', 'please', 'think', '4', 'bit']",N/A

I have a friend who is brain-injured and Joseph is so believable that it is heartbreaking.All of the performances are nuanced and believable. Jeff Daniels is thrilling as Joseph's blind roommate.The script of this movie is flawless.

1075822,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000QFCD8Q,trebe,"[2, 2]","With characters that don't quite fit into standard movie character mold, The Lookout (2007) is an offbeat crime drama that doesn't quite go where you expect.  Written and directed by Scott Frank (Out Of Sight), it's a strange, kind of haunting tale, that at times seems detached from reality, as a man that has suffered a brain injury becomes the pawn in a scheme to rob a bank.Chris Pratt (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) was behind the wheel, joyriding with a group of friends, when he got into an accident where several people were killed, a woman lost her leg, and he suffered an injury to his brain that diminished his mental capacity and memory.  Pratt writes things down in a notebook so he doesn't forget, lives with his blind roommate Lewis (Jeff Daniels, in a great performance), and has a job as a custodian at the Noel State Bank and Trust, working the graveyard shift, where the only break in the monotony is the occasional visit from Deputy Ted (Sergio Di Zio), who stops by to deliver donuts.  Chris dreams of becoming a teller, or opening a restaurant with Lewis, but doesn't get much support from his affluent family.A large shipment of cash is scheduled to arrive at the bank, and a group of petty crooks led by Gary Spargo (Matthew Goode) decides to recruit Pratt as the inside man in a robbery attempt.  Spargo introduces Chris to a new group of friends, that includes Luvlee (Isla Fisher), a knockout who seems to be impressed with the one time high school hockey star.  With a little convincing, Pratt agrees to join Spargo, and participates in the gathering information vital to planning the crime, but later when he tries to back out, Chris finds himself locked into a dangerous situation that turns violent and then disastrous.The Lookout is a film with interesting characters, and really solid acting performances by almost everyone involved.  The setup of the story is quite well done, but the robbery and aftermath, play a bit too smoothly to be realistic.  Part of what the film is about, is featuring a character coping with life after suffering a brain injury, but if you look beyond Chris Pratt's individual struggle, you have a man whose choices have had very serious consequences for many of those around him, including several dead friends, a woman who has lost her leg, a child without a father, and a friend who was nearly killed.  Pratt's lack of mental competence, serves as a free pass to continue to make mistakes.Chris escapes from the bank with the stolen money, but instead of telling the cops, he decides to handle the situation himself.  Up to this point you could view him as a pawn, but when he takes matters into his own hands, and picks up a gun with a premeditated intention to kill, you might think he would face some culpability.  Instead he is cleared of all charges, and the film finishes on an upbeat note, with Chris trying to get his life back together, although sadly once again, he has left tragedy in his wake.",3,a continuing tale of questionable decision making...,1331942400,"03 17, 2012",2012,2961,"['characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fit', 'standard', 'movie', 'character', 'mold', 'Lookout', '2007', 'offbeat', 'crime', 'drama', ""n't"", 'quite', 'go', 'where', 'expect', 'Written', 'directed', 'Scott', 'Frank', 'Out', 'Sight', 'strange', 'kind', 'haunting', 'tale', 'times', 'detached', 'reality', 'man', 'suffered', 'brain', 'injury', 'pawn', 'scheme', 'rob', 'bank.Chris', 'Pratt', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'was', 'wheel', 'joyriding', 'group', 'friends', 'when', 'got', 'accident', 'where', 'several', 'people', 'were', 'killed', 'woman', 'lost', 'leg', 'suffered', 'injury', 'brain', 'diminished', 'mental', 'capacity', 'memory', 'Pratt', 'things', 'down', 'notebook', 'so', ""n't"", 'forget', 'blind', 'roommate', 'Lewis', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'great', 'performance', 'job', 'custodian', 'Noel', 'State', 'Bank', 'Trust', 'working', 'graveyard', 'shift', 'where', 'only', 'break', 'monotony', 'occasional', 'visit', 'Deputy', 'Ted', 'Sergio', 'Di', 'Zio', 'who', 'deliver', 'donuts', 'Chris', 'dreams', 'becoming', 'teller', 'opening', 'restaurant', 'Lewis', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'support', 'affluent', 'family.A', 'large', 'shipment', 'cash', 'scheduled', 'arrive', 'bank', 'group', 'petty', 'crooks', 'led', 'Gary', 'Spargo', 'Matthew', 'Goode', 'recruit', 'Pratt', 'inside', 'man', 'robbery', 'attempt', 'Spargo', 'Chris', 'new', 'group', 'friends', 'Luvlee', 'Isla', 'Fisher', 'knockout', 'who', 'be', 'impressed', 'one', 'time', 'high', 'school', 'hockey', 'star', 'little', 'convincing', 'Pratt', 'join', 'Spargo', 'participates', 'gathering', 'information', 'vital', 'planning', 'crime', 'later', 'when', 'back', 'out', 'Chris', 'locked', 'dangerous', 'situation', 'violent', 'then', 'disastrous.The', 'Lookout', 'film', 'interesting', 'characters', 'really', 'solid', 'acting', 'performances', 'almost', 'everyone', 'involved', 'setup', 'story', 'quite', 'well', 'done', 'robbery', 'aftermath', 'play', 'bit', 'too', 'smoothly', 'be', 'realistic', 'Part', 'what', 'film', 'featuring', 'character', 'coping', 'life', 'suffering', 'brain', 'injury', 'look', 'Chris', 'Pratt', 'individual', 'struggle', 'have', 'man', 'choices', 'have', 'had', 'very', 'serious', 'consequences', 'many', 'including', 'several', 'dead', 'friends', 'woman', 'who', 'lost', 'leg', 'child', 'father', 'friend', 'who', 'was', 'nearly', 'killed', 'Pratt', 'lack', 'mental', 'competence', 'free', 'pass', 'continue', 'make', 'mistakes.Chris', 'escapes', 'bank', 'stolen', 'money', 'instead', 'telling', 'cops', 'handle', 'situation', 'Up', 'point', 'could', 'view', 'pawn', 'when', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'up', 'gun', 'premeditated', 'intention', 'kill', 'might', 'think', 'would', 'face', 'culpability', 'Instead', 'cleared', 'charges', 'film', 'finishes', 'upbeat', 'note', 'Chris', 'trying', 'get', 'life', 'back', 'together', 'sadly', 'once', 'again', 'left', 'tragedy', 'wake']",N/A

This unusual thriller directed and written by Scott Frank focuses as much on character as it does on the tense, moody atmosphere. Chris (Joseph Gordon-Levitt)had it all; he was a bright kid who also displayed talent in the hockey rink. Chris, his girlfriend and another couple are involved in a terrible car accident that leaves Chris brain damaged. He's unable to do anything more than simple tasks and can't even remember what change he should get back after buying a beer.SPOILERS AHEAD**When Chris gets sucked into a plan to rip off the bank where he is a janitor by smooth talking slime ball Gary Spargo (Mathew Goode), he finds himself over his head and with nowhere to turn. Initially Chris believes this will provide him with the start up money for a business he wants to start with his blind roommate Lewis (Jeff Daniels)but things spiral out of control and suddenly he has nowhere to turn.END OF SPOILERS**The film looks terrific with a crisp and detailed transfer to DVD. Audio sounds solid as well. The main extras we get here are a terrific commentary trackby writer/director Scott Frank discussing the making of the film and a 20 minute featurette that covers much of the same ground with cast and crew interviews. Scott discusses how the script had been shuffled from one studio to another as he watched in frustration eventually deciding he had better do it himself. Frank is rather blunt about his shortcomings as a director in the commentary track but honestly he did a terrific job on his first time in dual roles as writer & director.We also get a 9 minute featurette with Joseph Gordon-Levitt and director Frank discussing the development of the character of Chris. Gordon-Levitt reveals that he did quite a bit of research prior to shooting the film on the mentality disabled.You should be on ""the lookout"" for this fine film which got lost earlier amid some of the other films released at the same time. Although not perfect, ""The Lookout"" has strong performances and is well made by first time director Frank. I'm not surprised that the film got lost though as it isn't the type to lend itself to the hype machine of Hollywood as easily as, say, ""Transformers"" or other blockbuster films.

He plays Chris Pratt, a former star high school hockey player, suffering from short-term memory loss as a result of a tragic car accident.  Not only did the accident kill his best friend and his best friend's girlfriend, but ended his promising career.Jeff Daniel's is not a favorite of mine, but he gives an equally brilliant performance as Chris's blind housemate.  All of the supporting roles are cast perfectly with Isla Fischer delivering a surpisingly strong performance.This movie resonated with me in a similar way that Memento did (for obvious reasons).
