1085083,A1KU4WYGZBAX0G,B000S2B23E,Ansley,"[35, 37]","Here are my reasons for choosing this adaptation for my personal collection (over all the others):In screenplays for this novel, I've found that some writers miss the mark by a large margin and others are beautifully close.  I've read some of the criticism of modernizing the script for this movie, and I think the plus of the modernizing is that everyone involved in this production has contributed something bold.  The boldness achieved is, in my opinion, to be admired and respected.  I happen to think that Bronte would appreciate that since she's likely boldest of all.The reason this version succeeds with the dialogue b/w the two leads despite its modernizing the script is because the actors never sound like they're reading from a script.  And that's a very noticeable problem with so many productions.  Wilson and Stephens' conversations on-screen are perfectly believable, and maybe that has a lot to do with the script.  So kudos to Sandy Welch for that.  She's a master writer as far as I'm concerned.The most outstanding actors for the starring roles come together in this movie.  Toby Stephens gives Rochester an added dimension.  He portrays vulnerability through a sense of humor.  His subtlety in portraying emotion through his eyes is to be commended.  So my first reason for choosing this adaptation is Toby Stephens.Reason #2 is the portrayal of Jane. Of all the Janes, I've previously found myself irked at how an actress wouldn't show us Jane from the book.  The role is epic, and never has an actress understood principled, passionate Jane like Ruth Wilson. Wilson and Stephens = the best individually and the best as a couple.Another reason I purchased this over the standard U.S. release is because it has deleted scenes, trailers, on-set interviews and commentary included (thus Special Edition as on the DVD jacket).  I've watched Wuthering Heights that is included. This movie was also mostly accurate with some liberties taken for visual effects, but there wasn't magic in it to make me want to watch it numerous times.  Sarah Smart and Matthew Macfadyen (Catherine and Hareton) steal the screen, but their scenes are all too short.",5,Jane Eyre Special Edition (Masterpiece/BBC)...Ahh the fresh Eyre...,1309478400,"07 1, 2011",2011,2162,"['Here', 'are', 'reasons', 'choosing', 'adaptation', 'personal', 'collection', 'others', 'screenplays', 'novel', ""'ve"", 'found', 'writers', 'miss', 'mark', 'large', 'margin', 'others', 'are', 'beautifully', 'close', ""'ve"", 'read', 'criticism', 'modernizing', 'script', 'movie', 'think', 'plus', 'modernizing', 'everyone', 'involved', 'production', 'contributed', 'something', 'bold', 'boldness', 'achieved', 'opinion', 'be', 'admired', 'respected', 'happen', 'think', 'Bronte', 'would', 'appreciate', 'likely', 'boldest', 'all.The', 'reason', 'version', 'dialogue', 'two', 'modernizing', 'script', 'actors', 'never', 'sound', ""'re"", 'reading', 'script', 'very', 'noticeable', 'problem', 'so', 'many', 'productions', 'Wilson', 'Stephens', 'conversations', 'on-screen', 'are', 'perfectly', 'believable', 'maybe', 'lot', 'do', 'script', 'So', 'kudos', 'Sandy', 'Welch', 'master', 'writer', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned.The', 'most', 'outstanding', 'actors', 'starring', 'come', 'together', 'movie', 'Toby', 'Stephens', 'Rochester', 'added', 'dimension', 'vulnerability', 'sense', 'humor', 'subtlety', 'portraying', 'emotion', 'eyes', 'be', 'commended', 'first', 'reason', 'choosing', 'adaptation', 'Toby', 'Stephens.Reason', '2', 'portrayal', 'Jane', 'Janes', ""'ve"", 'previously', 'found', 'irked', 'how', 'actress', 'would', ""n't"", 'show', 'Jane', 'book', 'role', 'epic', 'never', 'actress', 'understood', 'principled', 'passionate', 'Jane', 'Ruth', 'Wilson', 'Wilson', 'Stephens', '=', 'best', 'individually', 'best', 'couple.Another', 'reason', 'purchased', 'standard', 'U.S.', 'release', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'trailers', 'on-set', 'interviews', 'commentary', 'included', 'thus', 'Special', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'jacket', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'Wuthering', 'Heights', 'included', 'movie', 'was', 'also', 'mostly', 'accurate', 'liberties', 'taken', 'visual', 'effects', 'there', 'was', ""n't"", 'magic', 'make', 'want', 'watch', 'numerous', 'times', 'Sarah', 'Smart', 'Matthew', 'Macfadyen', 'Catherine', 'Hareton', 'steal', 'screen', 'scenes', 'are', 'too', 'short']",Masterpiece Theatre - The Bronte Collection: (Jane Eyre / Wuthering Heights)

1085085,A3JEHW5U6BHBQ8,B000S2B23E,Cindy B,"[0, 1]","I got tired of waiting for Masterpiece Classics to replay this great production of Jane Eyre. Jane and Mr. Rochester's developing relationship from servant-master to equals is fascinating to watch. Could only wish for a bit more background development on Rochester's ill-fated first marriage and his wife's mental illness.Having never read Wuthering Heights or seen another version of this Bronte work, I was looking forward to a similarly positive reaction as to Jane Eyre. It was not to be. Wuthering Heights turned out to be a study in mankind's worse traits. It has been put on the shelf with other films I can only view once.I recommend buying this version of Jane Eyre separately if you can find it. If you're a fan of the darkest view of humanity buy the collection with Wuthering Heights.",4,Jane Eyre deserves 5 stars; Wuthering Heights not a fan,1379462400,"09 18, 2013",2013,796,"['got', 'tired', 'waiting', 'Masterpiece', 'Classics', 'replay', 'great', 'production', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'Jane', 'Mr.', 'Rochester', 'developing', 'relationship', 'servant-master', 'equals', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'Could', 'only', 'bit', 'more', 'background', 'development', 'Rochester', 'ill-fated', 'first', 'marriage', 'wife', 'mental', 'illness.Having', 'never', 'read', 'Wuthering', 'Heights', 'seen', 'version', 'Bronte', 'work', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'similarly', 'positive', 'reaction', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'was', 'not', 'be', 'Wuthering', 'Heights', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'study', 'mankind', 'worse', 'traits', 'been', 'put', 'shelf', 'other', 'films', 'can', 'only', 'view', 'once.I', 'recommend', 'buying', 'version', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'separately', 'can', 'find', ""'re"", 'fan', 'darkest', 'view', 'humanity', 'buy', 'collection', 'Wuthering', 'Heights']",Masterpiece Theatre - The Bronte Collection: (Jane Eyre / Wuthering Heights)

The truth is I wanted to see and hear more of Toby Stephens. Anyway, the interviews were quite good. The lead actors, director and writer all gave very interesting insights into their ideas for character and motivation. There is also running commentary on the first and fourth sections of the movie with all kinds of background info about locations, actor struggles, weather, you name it. Very entertaining except for the fact that my copy has the sound slightly out of synch for the movie running behind the commentary. I haven't watched Wuthering Heights yet but am disturbed by the other reviewer's remark of a rape by Heathcliff.

This version of Jane Eyre though is probably my favorite of all the Austen/Bronte period romances. Both the leads are amazing (I've fallen completely in love with Toby Steven's) and the script is beautifully written. The direction and cinematography is brilliant as well, making sure to balance the beauty of Thornfield Hall with its darkness and mystery.Ruth Wilson playing Jane is captivating to watch. She somehow goes from looking completely plain to ethereally beautiful with just a smile or turn of her head. She is a strong and moral person but also playful and passionate underneath which is clear in the book but usually lost or overshadowed in the adaptations I've seen before.Toby Stephens is equally brilliant as Mr Rochester even if he is too conventionally handsome to play the role. His Mr. Rochester is mischievous and inquisitive while still being the familiar brooding figure from other adaptations.Every scene between the two leads make it easy to see why they fall for each other. They challenge each other from the beginning and the banter between them is clever and electric. The chemistry between Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens is incredible and far more physical and raw than what is usually shown is such period romances. The longing between them is palpable and when Jane breaks down sobbing because she's left her love you believe every tear.I would recommend this version of Jane Eyre to anyone whether they've read the book and seen every adaptation or never even heard of it.",5,Best Jane Eyre adaptation out there!,1359417600,"01 29, 2013",2013,1629,"['have', 'admit', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'Wuthering', 'Heights', 'collection', ""'ve"", 'honestly', 'just', 'never', 'liked', 'story', 'version', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'probably', 'favorite', 'Austen/Bronte', 'period', 'romances', 'leads', 'are', 'amazing', ""'ve"", 'fallen', 'completely', 'love', 'Toby', 'Steven', 'script', 'beautifully', 'written', 'direction', 'cinematography', 'brilliant', 'well', 'making', 'sure', 'balance', 'beauty', 'Thornfield', 'Hall', 'darkness', 'mystery.Ruth', 'Wilson', 'playing', 'Jane', 'captivating', 'watch', 'somehow', 'looking', 'completely', 'plain', 'ethereally', 'beautiful', 'just', 'smile', 'turn', 'head', 'strong', 'moral', 'person', 'also', 'playful', 'passionate', 'underneath', 'clear', 'book', 'usually', 'lost', 'overshadowed', 'adaptations', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'before.Toby', 'Stephens', 'equally', 'brilliant', 'Mr', 'Rochester', 'even', 'too', 'conventionally', 'handsome', 'play', 'role', 'Mr.', 'Rochester', 'mischievous', 'inquisitive', 'while', 'still', 'being', 'familiar', 'brooding', 'figure', 'other', 'adaptations.Every', 'scene', 'two', 'leads', 'make', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'fall', 'other', 'challenge', 'other', 'beginning', 'banter', 'clever', 'electric', 'chemistry', 'Ruth', 'Wilson', 'Toby', 'Stephens', 'incredible', 'far', 'more', 'physical', 'raw', 'what', 'usually', 'shown', 'such', 'period', 'romances', 'longing', 'palpable', 'when', 'Jane', 'down', 'sobbing', 'left', 'love', 'believe', 'tear.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'version', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'anyone', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'seen', 'adaptation', 'never', 'even', 'heard']",Masterpiece Theatre - The Bronte Collection: (Jane Eyre / Wuthering Heights)
