1042164,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B000M341Q4,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[2, 3]","Mr. Christopher Guest has redefined the word ""mockumentary"".  With his impressive repetitive cast outings such as ""Waiting for Guffman"", ""Best in Show"", ""A Mighty Wind"", and the cult hit ""This is Spinal Tap"", Guest has proven himself time and time again that humor lays within the real person - the underdog - the least hopeful within the stories.  He has made us laugh again and again with catchy characters, powerful rhythm, and a rediscovery of the language which allows for stronger comedy.  He is the master of his trade, but recently he has gone off this golden path and lost his way through mainstream cinema.  ""For Your Consideration"" boasts bigger cameos, bigger sets, and a bigger concept, but lacks in the originality that we obtained in his earlier films.  Guest seems to be pushing the envelope with Hollywood in this feature, but it isn't funny - it is random, chaotic, and emotional when it should not be.  Being a fan of Guest's earlier work, I was initially excited about this outing, but upon viewing it just didn't gel together - emotionally or passionately like Guests other work.  This seemed like Guest made a film to spoof the industry, but instead created a dismal look at how comedy can self destruct, even with your regulars trying to make us laugh.Guest announced in 2005 that he would stop making the ""mockumentary"" because he thought they were not funny any longer.  Hoping to see bigger and braver things from this pioneering director, I hoped ""For Your Consideration"" would be a fresh chapter in his repertoire of films, but alas, it was nothing of the sort.  To begin, the characters seemed stale and uncharismatic.  As a ""mockumentary"", the audience may have had the opportunity to see these actors consume their roles, to build unknown back stories, or to challenge themselves to take their character to the limit, but it never happened as a full-feature film.  This was a regular comedy that fruitfully never picked up speed, never pushed the limit, and tried to use similar Guest techniques that would have only worked as a mockumentary.  It began to implode with the characters, since we couldn't see them talking directly to us, we had to follow their moves - watch them as they failed, and attempted to make us laugh with their irregularities.  Again, what would typically make us laugh in a mockumentary-styled film failed at this level.  To demonstrate the error, let's begin with Catherine O'Hara.  In Guest's work, she is typically a staple of comedy.  Her portrayal of Mickey Crabbe in ""A Might Wind"" was phenomenal, but in this film it seemed forced, unfunny, and catastrophic.  From the opening scene, O'Hara never really defines her character.  Is she pushing for freedom, is she ignorant to the truth, or is she trying to fit within the Hollywood scene?  Valid questions that never quite get off the ground as we are bombarded with more and more ""guest"" characters that push this little film into non-existence.  Harry Shearer is another example, typically he is genuine in his roles for Guest, but in this feature he just felt stale.  He wasn't trying to be funny, nor did he push any level of comedy.  The entire hot dog bit was clich&eacute;, as was Eugene Levy's performance as his agent.  I think that is where problems occurred in this film - there wasn't anything original about Guest's characters in this film, and I think the actors knew it.  Fred Willard was the only humorous element to this film - giving us the exact same performance as he did in ""Best in Show"".  This may not have been a mockumentary, but it would have been a mockumentary that would have saved this little feature.Guest had trouble behind the camera with this film.  His camera work seemed staged and oblique.  There was no questioning scene that pushed the limit or forced us to see Guest in a new light.  He teased the audience, giving us hopes that midway through this film he would transform it into a mockumentary, but alas it never happened.  The stages were set, but nothing happened.  I couldn't tell if it was the actors that weren't as funny, or Guest's vision was just weak.  As a viewer, you find yourself standing outside of this film.  You know what Guest's potential can be, yet when you watch this you know that there are just actors playing actors playing preset roles.  The addition of Ricky Gervais, Sandra Oh, and Rachael Harris made this Guest film feel like a downtrodden Woody Allen film.  Was it a homage to him?  The building blocks of this story were weak, thus the entire structure seemed to fall when the pieces fell apart.  Comedy was horrible, the story was non-existent, and the actors just seemed used and tired of the time, place, and story.One other aspect that bewildered me, is anyone else tired of the sad, unsung heroes of Christopher Guest's films seeming like they are being stepped on each minute of the feature.  They were fun in ""Waiting for Guffman"" and ""Best in Show"", they were endearing in ""A Mighty Wind"", but in this film they just felt hurt, and at times violent.  While I did chuckle at Willard showing up at the non-nominees doors the next day, I thought that crossed a line from funny to violently sad.  Again, I did laugh, but not in that boisterous ""Christopher Guest"" sort of way.  I think that best defines this film, it had its moments, but overall it just felt bland.  There was no flavor.  The actors realized this, but Guest continued with this sad little project.  Not a positive mark on his report card.Overall, I wasn't impressed.  This late in the game there is a level of necessity needed, either step up your choice of films (like direct a drama or science fiction) or continue growing the genre you have exploited.  ""For Your Consideration"" will have some chuckling moments, but nothing that screams amazing.  Guest could have strengthened his role as a comic genius by creating this same film under the guise of a mockumentary and it would have been phenomenal.  There was a lacking air of originality with this film and the actors genuinely didn't fit their parts.  This was a sad film that could have been more.  I saw the potential, but nothing came out of it.  I will continue to give Guest a shot with his amazing backlist of films, but a continuation of this type of film will lessen his appeal.  Watch it once, but not a film to keep in your collection.Grade: ** out of *****",2,"Wash, Rinse, Repeat.

The story is about an actress who discovers an online rumor suggesting her latest performance is Oscar worthy. It's hysterical how quickly the rumor grows and even more astonshing at how accurate the chain of events mirror reality. The thing I love about the Guest and Co. films is the ""quiet humor"". The jokes aren't obvious and in your face. The humor is in the moment or in the character or in a little passive line. My only gripe is the abruptness of the movie. It ended a little quicker than I expected which means I was enjoying myself so much I didn't want the party to end. But I do wish there was a little more time spent fleshing out the characters.

1042167,A11K83SZ0W14CE,B000M341Q4,"Barbara L. Pinzka ""Book Friend""","[6, 8]","While the latest offering from Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy, For Your Consideration, often had me laughing out loud, there's no denying that there are some tedious spells and the humor may be so industry-specific at times that many jokes will go undetected by those unfamiliar with the movie industry.  On the other hand, Guest/Levy's humor tends to be puckish and satiric, unlike the sophomoric bodily-function humor of the Farrelly brothers (There's Something About Mary), which I always find a plus.The plot revolves around the dreams of a movie cast comprised of a few has-beens and a few wanna-bes.  Their movie, Home for Purim, seems destined for direct-to-video release when an item appears somewhere on the internet that the senior actress' work might earn her - gasp - an Oscar. From this molehill of a rumor the proverbial mountain grows, and by the end of the many scenes of self-delusion and inside-Hollywood politics three, not just one, cast members are heralded as sure bets. To say more would enter Spoiler terriroty, but the denoument, while a bit over-long, is well-done.In addition to showing the behind-the-scenes atmosphere of a movie set, For Your Consideration also does a number on agent/client relationships,  talk shows (Jane Lynch and Fred Willard ""do"" Entertainment Tonight the way it should be done!), publicity reps, and more.The cast familar to fans of Guest/Levy movies (Best in Show, Waiting for Guffman, A Mighty Wind) is all here: Catharine O'Hara, Parker Posey, Fred Willard, Jane Lynch, Harry Shearer, Levy, Jennifer Coolidge, Bob Balaban, and Michael McKean, and all perform valiantly and well, with the exception of Coolidge, who seems even more dim than usual.  Ricky Gervais (the UK Office) makes a surprise and welcome appearance as a venial studio boss and steals many scenes.  A big surprise is the very funny performance of Scottish comedian Nina Conti (Tom's daughter) as a weather reporter who is also an (excellent) ventriloquist, using a monkey puppet as her foil (be sure to watch her in the DVD's extra features - in fact, be sure to watch them all).This movie isn't destined to be a classic, as I feel Best in Show is, but it will provide a relaxing evening of entertainment.",4,"Uneven but funny; a little too ""inside""",1172966400,"03 4, 2007",2007,2232,"['latest', 'offering', 'Christopher', 'Guest', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'Consideration', 'often', 'had', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'denying', 'are', 'tedious', 'spells', 'humor', 'may', 'be', 'so', 'industry-specific', 'times', 'many', 'jokes', 'will', 'go', 'undetected', 'unfamiliar', 'movie', 'industry', 'other', 'hand', 'Guest/Levy', 'humor', 'be', 'puckish', 'satiric', 'sophomoric', 'bodily-function', 'humor', 'Farrelly', 'brothers', 'Something', 'Mary', 'always', 'find', 'plus.The', 'plot', 'dreams', 'movie', 'cast', 'comprised', 'few', 'has-beens', 'few', 'wanna-bes', 'movie', 'Home', 'Purim', 'destined', 'direct-to-video', 'release', 'when', 'item', 'somewhere', 'internet', 'senior', 'actress', 'work', 'might', 'earn', 'gasp', 'Oscar', 'molehill', 'rumor', 'proverbial', 'mountain', 'grows', 'end', 'many', 'scenes', 'self-delusion', 'inside-Hollywood', 'politics', 'three', 'not', 'just', 'one', 'cast', 'members', 'are', 'heralded', 'sure', 'bets', 'say', 'more', 'would', 'enter', 'Spoiler', 'terriroty', 'denoument', 'bit', 'over-long', 'well-done.In', 'addition', 'showing', 'behind-the-scenes', 'atmosphere', 'movie', 'set', 'Consideration', 'also', 'number', 'agent/client', 'relationships', 'talk', 'shows', 'Jane', 'Lynch', 'Fred', 'Willard', 'do', 'Entertainment', 'Tonight', 'way', 'should', 'be', 'done', 'publicity', 'reps', 'more.The', 'cast', 'familar', 'fans', 'Guest/Levy', 'movies', 'Best', 'Show', 'Waiting', 'Guffman', 'A', 'Mighty', 'Wind', 'here', 'Catharine', ""O'Hara"", 'Parker', 'Posey', 'Fred', 'Willard', 'Jane', 'Lynch', 'Harry', 'Shearer', 'Levy', 'Jennifer', 'Coolidge', 'Bob', 'Balaban', 'Michael', 'McKean', 'perform', 'valiantly', 'well', 'exception', 'Coolidge', 'who', 'even', 'more', 'dim', 'usual', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', 'UK', 'Office', 'surprise', 'welcome', 'appearance', 'venial', 'studio', 'boss', 'steals', 'many', 'scenes', 'big', 'surprise', 'very', 'funny', 'performance', 'Scottish', 'comedian', 'Nina', 'Conti', 'Tom', 'daughter', 'weather', 'reporter', 'who', 'also', 'excellent', 'ventriloquist', 'using', 'monkey', 'puppet', 'foil', 'be', 'sure', 'watch', 'DVD', 'extra', 'features', 'fact', 'be', 'sure', 'watch', '.This', 'movie', ""n't"", 'destined', 'be', 'classic', 'feel', 'Best', 'Show', 'will', 'provide', 'relaxing', 'evening', 'entertainment']",For Your Consideration

The scene is awkward, as are some of the other scenes. But what else lies in the video are great, hysterical scenes. Eugene Levy as a scattered, cell-phone-hugging agent who lacks concern for his star client (Harry Shearer), and John Michael Higgins, who is absolutely unrecognizable during his first five minutes onscreen as a pushy-yet-insecure PR man who looks like a ""guest actor"" from the ""Love Boat"" TV series. Guest has very minimal screentime, but Fred Willard makes up for the lack of the director's appearance with his character's wonderful rambling and slightly self-absorbed demeanor. Check out the weather girl character with the ""monkey"" friend. The movie playfully makes fun of Hollywood, small films, the Oscars, moviegoers and, in a way, all of us, with a gentle, harmless smirk.The DVD's outtakes, especially with the ""Monkey"" girl, are outrageous.

The movie set was reminiscent of those in the 30s, 40s, and 50s.  The characters come together in the dispensary.  There are several different movies in progress and we flick from one sets of characters to another with no transition.  It was very disjointed.On the plus side, it was enjoyed by a large crowd of movie goers on the day after Thanksgiving.  I was surprised at the turnout as most people would have been shopping in the crowded malls.  It turned into an old-fashioned melodrama with much swooning.  In the beginning scene, we see Bette Davis' eyes on television and the music 'Hooray for Hollywood"" (thank God it was not the Doris Day version they play on MYL) fit the bill perfectly.  ""You have to give it away to keep it"" is the equivalent to ""You must let someone you love go; if he returns, he loves you, too.""  How nice.The men had really ugly hairdos.  The women's hair fit their characters, from vulgar to old woman.  Rachel Fisher looked like a young Katherine Hepburn, lovely; and the girl doing the interviews was like the Fifties movie magazines which I collected until I married at the age of 19 and was told I could no longer look at them.  I especially loved Eddie Fisher and all of his trials and tribulations.  He was my singer then.""It's what a son does for his Momma,"" came from one of the several scenerios going on at once.  One of the producers acted out a frauduent phone call with nobody on the other end.  His philosophy was to ""Say it like it is.""  They considered using reverse pyschology by advertising ""Don't come to our show.""  Evelyn would have been proud as she was a pro at using reverse psychology but I was unable to try it.

1042171,A20IIR0422G3A5,B000M341Q4,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[3, 6]","`For Your Consideration' is, by my count, actor / director / writer Christopher Guest's fifth parody of some near-great American institution, most similar perhaps in style and target to his `A Mighty Wind', as the latter parodied American folk music while the current effort parodies American independent film making. The reviews I have seen are almost unanimous in stating that each successive effort, from the high point of `This Is Spinal Tap', has been just a bit less entertaining.To the general consensus, I offer the opinion that a great part of Guest's problem is that he is parodying bad acting, writing, and directing, which simply comes off as bad acting, writing, and directing! I'm not sure Guest would have done any better parodying performances in a serious drama starring Meryl Streep and Nicholas Cage, let alone Ian McKellen doing Shakespeare, but I'm sure parodying C-List talent does NOT come off as A-list comedy. We even seem to lose the fun of recognizing the members of Guest's enormous repertoire company. This is a shame, since an appearance in Guest's films is easily among the highlights on the resumes of many actors, especially Eugene Levy, Michael McKean, and Fred Willard. I especially regret the weak performance of Parker Posey, who in other movies can often deliver such a wildly screwball performance it rivals some of Katherine Hepburn's non sequitor performances. One of the clearest affirmations of my hypothesis of why this film fails is the fact that I was relieved when Sandra Oh appears in a cameo role as an interviewer who is playing it straight. She may have given the best performance of the film (I'm exaggerating for sure, but that's how it feels).Guest may suffer in part from the fact that his comedy is based almost exclusively on the effectiveness of his parody. This is similar to several of Mel Brooks' efforts, such as `Spaceballs'. It is also what raises Woody Allen's movies, even the weaker ones above the level of `mere parody'. Allen can always be counted on to include at least a half dozen good jokes which will stand on their own and get a laugh in even his weakest efforts, such as `Shadows and Fog' and `The Curse of the Jade Scorpion'.What is worse, one never seems to connect with any of the characters. The closest I came to feeling any amount of pathos at all for any of the characters is with Harry Shearer's role as a hack actor whose main claim to fame is as a giant hot dog. Jesse White was able to achieve both success and respect as a bored Maytag repair man, but no one has any regard for a wiener in a white bread overcoat, made even more pathetic by the fact that the pork sausage was being played by a Jewish actor (or so it seemed to me). I recall forming a fair amount of connection with several of the characters in `Best in Show', and that wasn't entirely because they had dogs in tow. The worst waste was in the way the final surprise of the John Michael Higgins supporting character's winning an Oscar nomination was dropped in with no follow-on.Another major waste may have been Bob Balaban and Michael McKean as the two screenwriters. I suspect their parodied appearance on a `Charlie Rose' lookalike show was lost on most viewers. It may have been just a tiny bit better if the interviewer had been actually played by Charlie Rose, but I wouldn't guarantee it.This DVD has some better than average extras, especially the voice-over commentary by Guest and Levy, but the value here is diminished, because the movie gives me practically no incentive to watch the film again to listen to the commentary all the way through.If I were to guess at least two things Guest might want to do next time is to parody something which matters to his audience (`American Idol' and Republican Party politics come to mind) and to pare down the cast a bit so we develop more of a feeling for at least some of the lead characters.",3,Guest picked the wrong subject ot parody.,1174003200,"03 16, 2007",2007,3900,"['Consideration', 'count', 'actor', '/', 'director', '/', 'writer', 'Christopher', 'Guest', 'fifth', 'parody', 'near-great', 'American', 'institution', 'most', 'similar', 'perhaps', 'style', 'target', 'Mighty', 'Wind', 'latter', 'parodied', 'American', 'folk', 'music', 'current', 'effort', 'parodies', 'American', 'independent', 'film', 'making', 'reviews', 'have', 'seen', 'are', 'almost', 'unanimous', 'stating', 'successive', 'effort', 'high', 'point', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'been', 'just', 'bit', 'less', 'general', 'consensus', 'offer', 'opinion', 'great', 'part', 'Guest', 'problem', 'parodying', 'bad', 'acting', 'writing', 'directing', 'simply', 'off', 'bad', 'acting', 'writing', 'directing', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'Guest', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'parodying', 'performances', 'serious', 'drama', 'starring', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'let', 'alone', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'doing', 'Shakespeare', ""'m"", 'sure', 'parodying', 'C-List', 'talent', 'NOT', 'come', 'off', 'A-list', 'comedy', 'even', 'seem', 'lose', 'fun', 'recognizing', 'members', 'Guest', 'enormous', 'repertoire', 'company', 'shame', 'appearance', 'Guest', 'films', 'easily', 'highlights', 'resumes', 'many', 'actors', 'especially', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'Michael', 'McKean', 'Fred', 'Willard', 'especially', 'regret', 'weak', 'performance', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'who', 'other', 'movies', 'can', 'often', 'deliver', 'such', 'wildly', 'screwball', 'performance', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'non', 'sequitor', 'performances', 'One', 'clearest', 'affirmations', 'hypothesis', 'why', 'film', 'fact', 'was', 'relieved', 'when', 'Sandra', 'Oh', 'cameo', 'role', 'interviewer', 'who', 'playing', 'straight', 'may', 'have', 'given', 'best', 'performance', 'film', ""'m"", 'exaggerating', 'sure', 'how', '.Guest', 'may', 'suffer', 'part', 'fact', 'comedy', 'based', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'effectiveness', 'parody', 'similar', 'several', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'efforts', 'such', 'Spaceballs', 'also', 'what', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'movies', 'even', 'weaker', 'ones', 'level', 'mere', 'parody', 'Allen', 'can', 'always', 'be', 'counted', 'include', 'least', 'half', 'dozen', 'good', 'jokes', 'will', 'stand', 'own', 'get', 'laugh', 'even', 'weakest', 'efforts', 'such', 'Shadows', 'Fog', 'Curse', 'Jade', ""Scorpion'.What"", 'worse', 'one', 'never', 'connect', 'characters', 'closest', 'came', 'feeling', 'amount', 'pathos', 'characters', 'Harry', 'Shearer', 'role', 'hack', 'actor', 'main', 'claim', 'fame', 'giant', 'hot', 'dog', 'Jesse', 'White', 'was', 'able', 'achieve', 'success', 'respect', 'bored', 'Maytag', 'repair', 'man', 'one', 'regard', 'wiener', 'white', 'bread', 'overcoat', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'pathetic', 'fact', 'pork', 'sausage', 'was', 'being', 'played', 'Jewish', 'actor', 'so', 'seemed', 'recall', 'forming', 'fair', 'amount', 'connection', 'several', 'characters', 'Best', 'Show', 'was', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'had', 'dogs', 'tow', 'worst', 'waste', 'was', 'way', 'final', 'surprise', 'John', 'Michael', 'Higgins', 'supporting', 'character', 'winning', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'was', 'dropped', 'follow-on.Another', 'major', 'waste', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'Bob', 'Balaban', 'Michael', 'McKean', 'two', 'screenwriters', 'suspect', 'parodied', 'appearance', 'Charlie', 'Rose', 'lookalike', 'show', 'was', 'lost', 'most', 'viewers', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'tiny', 'bit', 'better', 'interviewer', 'had', 'been', 'actually', 'played', 'Charlie', 'Rose', 'would', ""n't"", 'guarantee', 'it.This', 'DVD', 'better', 'average', 'extras', 'especially', 'voice-over', 'commentary', 'Guest', 'Levy', 'value', 'here', 'diminished', 'movie', 'practically', 'incentive', 'watch', 'film', 'again', 'listen', 'commentary', 'way', 'through.If', 'were', 'guess', 'least', 'two', 'things', 'Guest', 'might', 'want', 'do', 'next', 'time', 'parody', 'something', 'matters', 'audience', 'American', 'Idol', 'Republican', 'Party', 'politics', 'come', 'mind', 'pare', 'down', 'cast', 'bit', 'develop', 'more', 'feeling', 'least', 'lead', 'characters']",For Your Consideration

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[5, 6]","***CONTAINS SPOILERS***Christopher Guest has given us cinematic magic before with such things as A MIGHTY WIND and BEST IN SHOW. Both had heart, comedy, and understated grace. But here with FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION, that previously successful recipe gets watered down so much that it killed the entire story. There were adequate moments -- thanks purely to Catherine O'Hara -- but they were seldom and lost amidst the scriptless format that director Guest so loves to play with.Guest reunites with his troupe of actors and tries his darnedest to give us some thought-provoking laughs. This time the story is about actors. Specifically, it's a group of actors who are on their downward slope of their acting careers (or are on a slope that never existed). Currently these folks are making a B-movie-ish title called `Home For Purim.' Catherine O'Hara, (MONSTER HOUSE) stars as Marilyn Hack (catch the last name there?), a B or C -- or however far down the alphabet you want to go -- list actress who's name suddenly gets noticed in a Hollywood blurb on the web. The site mentions the word ""Oscar"" and Marilyn is beside herself with concern. Could she be listed as a nominee? Oscar buzz grips the studio where `Home For Purim' is being filmed. A possible second nomination is also mentioned for another star of `Home For Purim'. The cast is electrified and divided. Feelings get bruised as some feel they should have gotten a mention or are jealous of the potential nominees.Acting agents get involved, producers fall over themselves to appease the distribution company (eventually changing the title to `Home For Thanksgiving' because `Home For Purim' sounds too Jewish), and the cast prepares for the Oscar nomination list one fateful early morning.Needless to say, the buzz quickly peters out once the Oscar list is read and the two would-be nominees aren't on it (but someone else is!)Christopher Guest tries admirably to show how hype doesn't translate to success in Hollywood, and how wrapped up and self-indulgent everyone can become (Catherine O'Hara's plastic surgery metamorphosis is actually quite funny).But the short screen time (86 minutes) rules out any possibility of getting to know these characters, which is pretty disastrous considering this is a character study film.Stick with Guest's earlier flicks and you'll be much happier with him as a whole.",2,Stick To Early Guest Works,1174521600,"03 22, 2007",2007,2365,"['***CONTAINS', 'SPOILERS***Christopher', 'Guest', 'given', 'cinematic', 'magic', 'such', 'things', 'MIGHTY', 'WIND', 'BEST', 'IN', 'SHOW', 'had', 'heart', 'comedy', 'understated', 'grace', 'here', 'FOR', 'YOUR', 'CONSIDERATION', 'previously', 'successful', 'recipe', 'watered', 'down', 'so', 'much', 'killed', 'entire', 'story', 'were', 'adequate', 'moments', 'thanks', 'purely', 'Catherine', ""O'Hara"", 'were', 'seldom', 'lost', 'amidst', 'scriptless', 'format', 'director', 'Guest', 'so', 'play', 'with.Guest', 'reunites', 'troupe', 'actors', 'darnedest', 'give', 'thought-provoking', 'laughs', 'time', 'story', 'actors', 'Specifically', 'group', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'downward', 'slope', 'acting', 'careers', 'are', 'slope', 'never', 'existed', 'Currently', 'folks', 'are', 'making', 'B-movie-ish', 'title', 'called', 'Home', 'Purim', 'Catherine', ""O'Hara"", 'MONSTER', 'HOUSE', 'Marilyn', 'Hack', 'catch', 'last', 'name', 'there', 'B', 'C', 'however', 'far', 'down', 'alphabet', 'want', 'go', 'list', 'actress', 'who', 'name', 'suddenly', 'noticed', 'Hollywood', 'blurb', 'web', 'site', 'word', 'Oscar', 'Marilyn', 'beside', 'concern', 'Could', 'be', 'listed', 'nominee', 'Oscar', 'buzz', 'studio', 'where', 'Home', 'Purim', 'being', 'filmed', 'possible', 'second', 'nomination', 'also', 'mentioned', 'star', 'Home', 'Purim', 'cast', 'electrified', 'divided', 'Feelings', 'get', 'bruised', 'feel', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'mention', 'are', 'jealous', 'potential', 'nominees.Acting', 'agents', 'get', 'involved', 'producers', 'fall', 'appease', 'distribution', 'company', 'eventually', 'changing', 'title', 'Home', 'Thanksgiving', 'Home', 'Purim', 'sounds', 'too', 'Jewish', 'cast', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'list', 'one', 'fateful', 'early', 'morning.Needless', 'say', 'buzz', 'quickly', 'out', 'once', 'Oscar', 'list', 'read', 'two', 'would-be', 'nominees', 'are', ""n't"", 'someone', 'else', 'Christopher', 'Guest', 'admirably', 'show', 'how', 'hype', ""n't"", 'translate', 'success', 'Hollywood', 'how', 'wrapped', 'up', 'self-indulgent', 'everyone', 'can', 'become', 'Catherine', ""O'Hara"", 'plastic', 'surgery', 'metamorphosis', 'actually', 'quite', 'funny', '.But', 'short', 'screen', 'time', '86', 'minutes', 'rules', 'out', 'possibility', 'getting', 'know', 'characters', 'pretty', 'disastrous', 'considering', 'character', 'study', 'film.Stick', 'Guest', 'earlier', 'flicks', ""'ll"", 'be', 'much', 'happier', 'whole']",For Your Consideration

1042174,A2FQ2M9ZIODFKV,B000M341Q4,Bradley Friedman,"[14, 19]","I count myself a huge fan of Christopher Guest and his assembly of some of the finest comic actors of our time. When I read on IMBD over a year ago that this movie was coming out, I have to say that it was the only film of 2006 that I anticipating in advance with pleasure. It didn't matter to me that Guest had announced that he was setting aside the mockumentary format, so long as his imagination (along with Eugene Levy's) and the acting of this great ensemble were on display. I even relished some of the digs Guest had planned for those in the industry who survive on Oscar fever.So here's the deal: the satire isn't that sharp. The bad ""movie within a movie"" just isn't that funny. The mockumentary format isn't exactly abandoned, since much of the film consists of interviews with the various personalities involved with ""Home for Purim,"" and yet those interviews just don't have the funny bite of the characters in ""Waiting for Guffman"" or ""Best in Show."" And despite first class work from his actors as usual, they have created a stable of characters that, for the most part, aren't particularly interesting. As has been stated before, Catherine O'Hara and Harry Shearer are great, and Jane Lynch can read the phone book to me and I will be laughing on the floor. Seeing all these actors on screen is like returning to a wonderfully off-kilter family reunion. Unfortunately, the script they have been given (or scenario, in case much of this is improvised) just doesn't ring funny.Of course this is disappointing. And of course it doesn't mean squat to my deep admiration for Guest and company. I will even buy the movie because, like someone here said, I consider myself a ""completist"" of this man's work. There are even a few funny bits, and O'Hara ranks as a great dramatic actress in my book. I would love to see more of her in varied film roles. And while I can't believe that anyone connected with the film will ever read this, I wouldn't want them to think that my disapproval means that I don't encourage them to stretch and change as they want.

The cast is spectacular, and includes Christopher Guest's regulars, foremost among them Jane Lynch and Fred Willard.  If you liked ""Best of Show,"" ""Waiting for Guffman"" or Guest's other work, you'll find this movie at least OK.  It's amusing, but generally is not a laugh-out-loud funny comedy.As with any of Guest's films, there is far more footage shot than is actually used; it's the nature of the improv-based movie that it is assembled in the editing room afterward more than written beforehand.

Crockett ""Domino713""","[4, 5]","The comedy group that brought such hilarious odd-ball classics as ""Best in Show"" and ""A Mighty Wind"", teamed together once more for your consideration...no pun intended.""For Your Consideration"" takes the audience through the motions of an indie art film called 'Home for Purim' that is in production. After several cast members catch wind that there is Oscar buzz surrounding their tiny film, with a few of them singled out as potential nominees, the information soon goes to their heads, and creates a few problems...Admittedly, this isn't this comedy troupe's best work. It has it's moments, as it's fated to do with such a great cast, but in the end it just falls short of reaching it's potential. It has a very offbeat sort of humor about it, which is appealing to fans of this comedy group, but the true laughs are few and far between.One of the inherent charms of this film, however, is it's ability to really poke fun at Hollywood, and it's incessant quest for that little gold statue. Every year there are obvious ""Oscar vehicles"" for certain actresses or actors (i.e. roles they took on *because* they they thought it would earn them an Oscar nod), which inevitably turns me off of that film. ""For Your Consideration"" does a good job at making fun of the Oscar race, even if that fact doesn't quite save the film from getting boring at times.I think I enjoyed Parker Posey's performance the most, because she has the inate ability to convey so much with a fairly quiet and subdued performance (with the occasional outbursts, of course). I must say that I was also impressed with Catherine O'Hara's ability to perform with a completely frozen face during the last half of the film (her character apparently underwent a barrage of plastic surgery in preparation for her imminent Academy Award nomination, including extensive botox treatments, because her face did *not* move hardly at all!)Special features on this disc include a director's commentary, deleted scenes, and theatrical trailer. There's nothing really special or unique found within these special features, but at least there *are* some special features (unlike the new practice of studios forcing consumers to pay extra to purchase a 2-disc Special Editon in order to get ANY special features at all).Bottom line, it was occasionally charming, with a few laughs here or there, but overall a little disappointing (and kind of boring).

1042179,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000M341Q4,Chris Pandolfi,"[4, 6]","Chances are the Oscar will not go to Christopher Guest's ""For Your Consideration,"" a carefully constructed but at times dry satire of the movie industry. Those of you expecting a laugh-out-loud comedy will be disappointed; this film relies on subtleties that will most likely only appeal to those in show business. That may be the reason why I found some of the humor a little difficult to understand; as much as I love going to the movies, I have absolutely no idea how they're run behind the scenes, and I certainly have no way of knowing just how insightful such a satire is. Nonetheless, it is a funny film, and I definitely give credit to the writers--Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy--for creating characters that are both comedic and complex. Some serious thought went into this film, and it is worth watching.The plot centers on the production of a period film called ""Home for Purim,"" a dramatic tale about the turmoil within a Southern Jewish family. Marilyn Hack (Catherine O'Hara), a veteran actress who idolizes Bette Davis' performance in ""Jezebel,"" plays the dying mother. Victor Allen Miller (Harry Shearer), a struggling actor who works for scale, plays the father. Brian Chubb (Christopher Moynihan) and Callie Webb (Parker Posey) play the children: the brother is a naval officer and the sister hasn't been getting along with her family (not helped by the fact that she's a lesbian). The director is Jay Berman (Christopher Guest), whose character may not be realistic but definitely fits the stereotypical image of the modern filmmaker. He looks for ""depth"" and ""emotion"" from his actors, and he has a very clear ""vision"" in mind.As the filming of ""Home for Purim"" progresses, industry insiders and entertainment talk shows begin generating award buzz for specific actors. Marilyn is the first to be told that her performance may be worthy of a nomination. This understandably sends her over the moon; while this isn't explicitly stated, it's safe to assume that she's been an under-appreciated actress (one security guard tells her that she should have been in that Sharon Stone film). It now seems as if she'll get the recognition she deserves. At the same time, Victor and Callie are also getting some good press, resulting in some heavy media coverage. It also results in friction between Callie and Brian, who have been dating.There are also a host of secondary characters, all of which add to the story in one way or another. There's Morley Orfkin (Eugene Levy), Victor's completely incompetent agent. There's Whitney Taylor Brown (Jennifer Coolidge), the busty, overly dressed producer of ""Home for Purim."" We also meet Philip Koontz (Bob Balaban) and Lane Iverson (Michael McKean), former playwrights who wrote the screenplay for ""Home for Purim."" There's Cory Taft (John Michael Higgins), the studio publicist who's wound up tighter than a bungee cord. Finally, there's Sandy Lane (Ed Begley, Jr.), Marilyn's makeup designer.For everyone, a whirlwind decent into the award season begins, highlighted by intense television interviews. We get an especially humorous parody of shows like ""Access Hollywood"" and ""Entertainment Tonight"" with ""Hollywood Now,"" hosted by the obnoxious duo of Chuck Porter (Fred Willard) and Cindy Martin (Jane Lynch). They may actually be the best characters of the film; they relentlessly pursue the latest Hollywood story, and much like real entertainment journalists, they say some of the most unnecessary and unkind things about actors. It's Porter in particular who spreads his personality the thickest, perfectly accented by a hairdo that comes to a point at the top of his head. This character may not come as a surprise to fans of Fred Willard; he's once again playing the insensitive loud mouth with the biting wit. If only he didn't play it so well.I think the funniest thing about ""For Your Consideration"" is the intentional misdirection of the characters. Berman seems like a competent director, yet it's quite obvious that his cast couldn't act its way out of a paper bag. Every line results in a melodramatic delivery. Every southern accent is exaggerated and phony. In the real world, such performances would never be taken seriously. The audience is well aware that if ""Home for Purim"" were a real film, it would be an absolute disaster. But within the world created by Guest and Levy, it's a historical masterpiece, filled with memorable performances. That's why the idea is so funny; actors in an obviously bad film are getting accolades from critics and audiences alike, and it may even result in Academy recognition.But who actually ends up getting nominated? Were the filmmakers and marketing people able to explain the film's new title, ""Home for Thanksgiving""? Does Marilyn's heavy plastic surgery affect her chances of getting nominated? Do any of these questions actually matter? In this case, I have to say yes; ""For Your Consideration"" examines how a single film production can affect people's lives, in both good ways and bad. The success or failure of a film will force an actor into making decisions, all of which will be judged superficially by the media. Such is the way of today's real life movie industry, something that lends itself perfectly to a satirical commentary. ""For Your Consideration"" is not Christopher Guest's best film, and it certainly isn't his funniest, but it works just the same.",4,And the Oscar Goes to ...,1164844800,"11 30,

DeRiemer,"[10, 14]","When a rumor spreads that an aging, passed-by actress named Marilyn Hack is in line for an Oscar nomination for her role in the yet-to-be-released corn-pone movie, Home for Purim, the gods of ambition, resentment, hope, angst and envy descend on Tinsel Town. This isn't one of Christopher Guest's and his partner Eugene Levy's docu-comedy satires, it's a cocked-eyebrow story about Hollywood pretensions. For Your Consideration has some clever set-ups, some genuinely funny actors strutting about while they improvise and some funny bits. But how do you successfully satirize something -- Hollywood -- which already is so bloated with self-esteem we snicker at the name?Guest and Levy give us great takes on such smarmy situations as the Oscar race, the E! Network and it's clones, actor neediness, agents and writers, and self-justifying ambition. Trouble is, it's all being done in the real world while we watch. Few things in fiction are as awesome as in real life studios and stars campaign for Oscar wins. Few things are as awful as entertainment ""reporters"" with their inane, insincere questions and perfect grooming. Can one satirize performance art by screaming the p-word when in real life an artist on stage covers her nude body with Hershey's chocolate syrup and moans?The idea of the movie, for me, just doesn't work, but that doesn't mean it lacks lots of funny piece-parts. The stand-out is Catherine O'Hara. She plays Marilyn Hack, an over-the-hill actress who is stunned to hear her name used in the same sentence as ""Oscar."" She doesn't believe it...she wants to believe it...she does believe it. From an actress resigned to hanging on by her fingertips in the movie world, she winds up blow-dried, lips plumped, in a too-tight short-short skirt doing the TV late-night entertainment rounds.

1042184,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B000M341Q4,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[1, 1]","In trying to get at the heart of why this film is merely good, not hilarious, I think that an over-reliance on improvisation is at fault. In a mockumentary, such rough moments can be `disguised' as byproducts of the faux reality, whereas in a straight film like this they cannot. A good example is provided by John Michael Higgins as Corey Taft, the stolid agent for Marilyn Hack. While he's got a few good scenes, too many of his obnoxious to the core character simply is stuff seen done better before. And he suffers in contrast to Levy's character, Morley Orfkin, agent to Victor Allen Miller. The same goes for Ed Begley Jr.'s tired and routine gay makeup man character, Sandy Lane. Also, some of the same old tired in-jokes and stereotypes about Hollywood abound. If only two or three were used, rather than fifteen or twenty, the film would have been better off, and the balance would have aided the true pathos of the film. In that sense, this film was a bit lesser version of David Mamet's State And Main crossed with Robert Altman's The Player.Yet, despite all that, this film is, in truth, a good adult comedy, and given that they are so rare, its flaws are minor in comparison to its good points. Compare it to the latest black or teen exploitation comedy and you'll agree. For Your Consideration may not, itself, be worthy of consideration for an Academy Award, but it may stand out as a critical film in the continued evolution of one of American film's most original and funny filmic auteurs.

There seemed to be a great deal more acting in this film rather than improvising for a great joke.Catherine O'Hara is brilliant as the fading and frighteningly insecure Marilyn Hack.  She is acting in a nothing film entitled ""Home for Purim"".  Harry Shearer is her male lead, Victor Allan Miller who has been in show business for forty years and is best known for being a hot dog in a commercial.  His role in ""Home for Purim"" requires him to have a simultaneous Southern accent with Yiddish elements.  An amazing feat to see and hear.Eugene Levy is Victor's agent and is quite wonderful in his the way he manipulates Victor into believing he isn't auditioning while he reads for a part.  How many fourth rate talent agents are required to engage in these kinds of manipulations?  Or agents at any level, for that matter?  Jennifer Coolidge is, Whitney Talyor Brown, the producer of this tiny film and is wonderfully clueless, but serves her role for the film admirably.Christopher Guest plays the lonsuffering director (what a contrast to the director of ""Waiting for Guffman!"").  It was a nice touch directing a touching scene while eating a corned beef sandwich.  Parker Posey is Callie Webb plays the Rachel who is coming home referred to in the title.  She seems somewhat together, but when we learn that she had tried to be a stand up with a miserable piece called ""No [...]Intended"", we see the beginning of what unfolds for her character the rest of the movie.  Well done.  Her boyfriend, Brian Chubb, is played by Christopher Moynihan.  He has a great scene with Christopher Guest about the background for his role in ""Purim"" that is absolutely priceless.  Also, there is a scene where nearly everyone else in the cast is getting interviewed by the wonderful Fred Willard and Brian is seething without expression.  A wonderful touch.John Michael Higgins is the publicist Corey Taft who takes a piece of rumor and actually gets some buzz for the film.  He thinks he is Chocktaw.  Ed Begley Jr. is Marilyn Hack's supportive hairdresser and adds some nice touches to the story.  Michael McKean and Bob Balaban, who usually have much bigger speaking roles in Guest films, are fabulously understated as the screenwriters for ""Home for Purim"".  There is a scene with a Charlie Rose type where they can't even get a syllable in during the interview.Everyone in the film is wonderful.  And I enjoyed it, but there are some very sad currents in the film, too.  When Marilyn Hack thinks the buzz she is getting will revive her career, the plastic surgery damaged face and sexy clothes that would be too young for someone twenty years younger almost hurt us.  We ache for her.  Some people don't like that in a comedy.

For Your Consideration is a cautionary look at the film world, what hype does to those involved in the process (writers, directors, actors and stagehands alike), and how this ultimately causes people to compromise themselves to the point that they are practically unrecognizable.  Marilyn Hack (Catherine O'Hara) is an aging starlet involved in the production of HOME FOR PURIM, where she plays the dying matriarch in a Southern Jewish household.  When word gets out that she might be the recipient of an Oscar nomination it quite literally goes to her head, as well as the heads of those around her.This film is darkly funny and also tragic.  Christopher Guest takes a look at the industry that has long-ignored his own bodies of work (Waiting For Guffman, Best In Show--only exception being the Best Song Nomination for ""A Mighty Wind"").  Although this film is rich with subtle humor, the typical ""potty mouth"" jokes we have come to expect from his productions and eccentric characters, this is also almost what could be described as a punch in the face at the mainstream film world.  I really feel that this was a thinly veiled attempt to take potshots by the bitter Guest, at the film business that quite often overlooks small, independent movies, in favor of larger Hollywood productions.I left the theatre feeling a little sick, to be honest with you.  Christopher Guest really hits the nail on the head with this one.  For a lighter look at show business, I suggest you check out Waiting For Guffman.  For Your Consideration isn't for sissies.

Well, that's technically true: ""For Your Consideration"" has no talking-to-the-camera moments.But while Guest has abandoned the mockumentary format -- as shown in movies like ""Waiting for Guffman"" and ""A Mighty Wind"" -- he hasn't lost his knack for hysterical comedy and intensely quirky characters. It's less intimate than his prior movies, but still skewers the entire entertainment industry, piece by piece.As the movie opens, several actors are shooting ""Home For Purim,"" a Southern Jewish tearjerker entered on a dying matriarch and her fragmented family. Then a stagehand tells Marilyn Hack (Catherine O'Hara) that there are Web rumors about her receiving an Oscar. Suddenly buzz is building, and everyone is excited about the possibility of their tiny movie getting notice (and though that, their careers).The Oscar buzz builds higher as the cast does publicity for ""Home For Purim,"" and two more rumored nominations pop up. Two actors break up over potential Oscar stress, another goes on MTV-style shows, and the movie gets its theme changed to make it more ""inclusive."" The entire cast is on tenterhooks... but on nomination night, who is going to be the star?Metafictional movies, and movies about makig movies, usually stink to high heaven. But Guest is the exception that proves the rule, as he mercilessly mocks E!-style journalism, critics, MTV, narcissistic producers, and even the Academy itself (""Give us all the awards -- we're FRENCH!"").Admittedly, this is not Guest at his best -- since the characters don't talk to the camera, they feel more distant. However, Guest has a knack for pathos mingled with biting satire. And best of all, these talented actors toss off improvised dialogue as if they were born to (""We don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater here. Because you'll just get a wet and critically injured baby!"").Most of the humor is because of the weird characters -- Eugene, Levy as a slimy agent, Jennifer Coolidge as a blonde bimbo producer, and Fred Willard as an obnoxious E!-style reporter with a silly faux-hawk (Ryan Seacrest, this is you in twenty years!). And keep an eye out for Ricky ""The Office"" Gervais as an exec determined to water down the movie.And O'Hara is sublime here. Her portrayal of a resigned, aging actress who gets high on hope is both hilarious and tragic, and she's the one character that you cannot laugh at by the end.

Drenched with his deadpan wit, Guest's mockumentaries have been such well-targeted show business satires that it's hard to know when the script stops and the improvised reality begins. But that's a lot of the fun with his films, even though his newest is easily the most structured of the bunch. Along with constant co-writer and co-star Eugene Levy, Guest picks a target ripe with possibilities in this 2006 comedy, the Oscar-baiting season prior to the nominations, and surprisingly foregoes the direct interview format in favor of a more traditional narrative. I have to admit I miss some of this dynamic because the on-camera realism resulted in some of the funniest moments in the previous films.Gratefully, what has been kept from his other films is Guest's stellar ensemble company of comic actors, and this time an even larger cast has been gathered, none of whom disappoint in this outing. The plot focuses on the production of a low-budget studio-bound film, ""Home for Purim"", a WWII-era family melodrama about a Jewish family in Georgia coping with the mother's terminal illness and the daughter's emergence as a lesbian. Directed by an authoritarian nebbish with an Art Garfunkel hairdo named Jay Berman, the film looks to be an overly sincere piece of tripe, but a blogger on one of the movie sites has predicted leading lady Marilyn Hack, a resigned, over-the-hill B-actress, will be nominated for an Oscar. This starts an Oscar buzz that engulfs the two other nominal principals of the movie, hot-dog pitchman Victor Allen Miller and ""serious"" actress Callie Webb, and the tidal wave of publicity drastically changes the direction and marketing campaign of the movie even before it's completed.Guest and Levy fully capture the superficial pandering that occurs when the buzz is in full swing, and they particularly ridicule the ignorance and outdated thinking of those who find themselves in this lightning-in-a-bottle situation. There are acidic jabs at all the infotainment programs - ""Entertainment Tonight"", ""MTV TRL"", ""The Charlie Rose Show"" and ""Ebert & Roeper"" - but this is character-driven farce, and several stand out. In a brave turn as Marilyn, the wonderful and ever-dependable Catherine O'Hara superbly captures the almost overnight evolution from forgotten, timeworn actress into botox-infused, cleavage-squeezing A-lister wannabe. Harry Shearer gets his best showcase yet as the put-upon Victor whose mouthy agent Morley Orfkin refuses to take his calls until the buzz hits them. As Callie, Parker Posey is more in reactive mode here, though she has a funny Sandra Bernhard-like bit with her character's one-woman show, ""No Penis Intended"".Everyone else gets less screen time, but they all provide memorably riotous contributions - Guest as Berman, Levy as Morley, Jennifer Coolidge as clueless producer Whitney Taylor Brown, John Michael Higgins as bromide-spouting publicist Corey Taft, Don Lake and Michael Hitchcock as the Love It/Hate It movie critics, Michael McKean and Bob Balaban as the academic screenwriters, Ed Begley Jr. as Marilyn's fey hairdresser (and biggest fan), Ricky Gervais as the oily studio honcho, and best of all, as the entertainment TV co-hosts, Fred Willard as mohawk-moussed Chuck Porter and Jane Lynch as gam-showcasing Mary Hart-knockoff Cindy Martin. I imagine Guest's reputation is the reason you see such high-profile actors like Sandra Oh and Craig Bierko in nothing more than bit parts here. The film takes a sharp turn toward the end that adds surprising vitriol to the laughs, and the vituperative tone makes the proceedings all the more devastating and resonant. More like ""A Mighty Wind"" with its dramatic undercurrents, this one is not as laugh-out-loud as ""Waiting for Guffman"" and ""Best in Show"", but it shows a continuing maturation in Guest's filmmaking technique that is most welcome.",4,Skewering Oscar Buzz with Laughs and Surprising Vitriol on Guest's Non-Mockumentary Satire,1165017600,"12 2, 2006",2006,3995,"['look', 'forward', 'Christopher', 'Guest', 'movies', 'same', 'way', 'Ralphie', 'did', 'much', 'beloved', 'Red', 'Ryder', 'BB', 'Gun', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Story', 'Drenched', 'deadpan', 'wit', 'Guest', 'mockumentaries', 'have', 'been', 'such', 'well-targeted', 'show', 'business', 'hard', 'know', 'when', 'script', 'stops', 'improvised', 'reality', 'lot', 'fun', 'films', 'even', 'newest', 'easily', 'most', 'structured', 'bunch', 'constant', 'co-writer', 'co-star', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'Guest', 'target', 'ripe', 'possibilities', '2006', 'comedy', 'Oscar-baiting', 'season', 'prior', 'nominations', 'surprisingly', 'direct', 'interview', 'format', 'favor', 'more', 'traditional', 'narrative', 'have', 'admit', 'miss', 'dynamic', 'on-camera', 'realism', 'resulted', 'funniest', 'moments', 'previous', 'films.Gratefully', 'what', 'been', 'kept', 'other', 'films', 'Guest', 'stellar', 'ensemble', 'company', 'comic', 'actors', 'time', 'even', 'larger', 'cast', 'been', 'gathered', 'none', 'whom', 'disappoint', 'outing', 'plot', 'production', 'low-budget', 'studio-bound', 'film', 'Home', 'Purim', 'WWII-era', 'family', 'melodrama', 'Jewish', 'family', 'Georgia', 'coping', 'mother', 'terminal', 'illness', 'daughter', 'emergence', 'lesbian', 'Directed', 'authoritarian', 'nebbish', 'Art', 'Garfunkel', 'hairdo', 'named', 'Jay', 'Berman', 'film', 'be', 'overly', 'sincere', 'piece', 'tripe', 'blogger', 'one', 'movie', 'predicted', 'leading', 'lady', 'Marilyn', 'Hack', 'resigned', 'over-the-hill', 'B-actress', 'will', 'be', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'Oscar', 'buzz', 'two', 'other', 'nominal', 'principals', 'movie', 'hot-dog', 'pitchman', 'Victor', 'Allen', 'Miller', 'serious', 'actress', 'Callie', 'Webb', 'tidal', 'wave', 'publicity', 'drastically', 'direction', 'marketing', 'campaign', 'movie', 'even', 'completed.Guest', 'Levy', 'fully', 'capture', 'superficial', 'pandering', 'when', 'buzz', 'full', 'swing', 'particularly', 'ridicule', 'ignorance', 'outdated', 'thinking', 'who', 'find', 'lightning-in-a-bottle', 'situation', 'are', 'acidic', 'jabs', 'infotainment', 'programs', 'Entertainment', 'Tonight', 'MTV', 'TRL', 'Charlie', 'Rose', 'Show', 'Ebert', 'Roeper', 'character-driven', 'farce', 'several', 'stand', 'out', 'brave', 'turn', 'Marilyn', 'wonderful', 'ever-dependable', 'Catherine', ""O'Hara"", 'superbly', 'almost', 'overnight', 'evolution', 'forgotten', 'timeworn', 'actress', 'botox-infused', 'cleavage-squeezing', 'A-lister', 'wannabe', 'Harry', 'Shearer', 'best', 'showcase', 'yet', 'put-upon', 'Victor', 'mouthy', 'agent', 'Morley', 'Orfkin', 'take', 'calls', 'buzz', 'Callie', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'more', 'reactive', 'mode', 'here', 'funny', 'Sandra', 'Bernhard-like', 'bit', 'character', 'one-woman', 'show', 'No', 'Penis', 'Intended', '.Everyone', 'else', 'less', 'screen', 'time', 'provide', 'memorably', 'riotous', 'contributions', 'Guest', 'Berman', 'Levy', 'Morley', 'Jennifer', 'Coolidge', 'clueless', 'producer', 'Whitney', 'Taylor', 'Brown', 'John', 'Michael', 'Higgins', 'bromide-spouting', 'publicist', 'Corey', 'Taft', 'Don', 'Lake', 'Michael', 'Hitchcock', 'Love', 'It/Hate', 'movie', 'critics', 'Michael', 'McKean', 'Bob', 'Balaban', 'academic', 'screenwriters', 'Ed', 'Begley', 'Jr.', 'Marilyn', 'fey', 'hairdresser', 'biggest', 'fan', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', 'oily', 'studio', 'honcho', 'best', 'entertainment', 'TV', 'co-hosts', 'Fred', 'Willard', 'mohawk-moussed', 'Chuck', 'Porter', 'Jane', 'Lynch', 'gam-showcasing', 'Mary', 'Hart-knockoff', 'Cindy', 'Martin', 'imagine', 'Guest', 'reputation', 'reason', 'see', 'such', 'high-profile', 'actors', 'Sandra', 'Oh', 'Craig', 'Bierko', 'nothing', 'more', 'bit', 'parts', 'here', 'film', 'sharp', 'turn', 'end', 'surprising', 'vitriol', 'laughs', 'vituperative', 'tone', 'proceedings', 'more', 'devastating', 'resonant', 'More', 'A', 'Mighty', 'Wind', 'dramatic', 'undercurrents', 'one', 'not', 'as', 'laugh-out-loud', 'Waiting', 'Guffman', 'Best', 'Show', 'continuing', 'maturation', 'Guest', 'filmmaking', 'technique', 'most', 'welcome']",For Your Consideration

Sometimes it works: sometimes it flounders.  Or to quote a famous advertisement 'Sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes you don't'.For this viewer this mocumentary about a very bad film company churning out a very bad film with a rather pitiful cast of actors falling victim to Internet rumors that an Oscar is in the air works as a funny idea and social comment for about the first half four and then sadly falls apart painfully as it proceeds to its wholly predictable end.  Guest uses his usual company of actors (Catherine O'Hara, Parker Posey, etc) and they seem to have a good time making fun of themselves ultimately.  Yes, there are funny moments, but the further the movie plods the less funny the moments become and ultimately the result of the 'rumor of greatness' shows us the shallow lives of the sad sack troupe of actors and producers and writers that started out with a pretty awful idea.Guest usually pulls these capers off nicely, but perhaps with such films as 'The Producers' musical on the screens simultaneously the joke is stale.  It is a good film to watch as Oscar time is upon us - and there is some pungent jabbing at awards concepts floating through the film.

I felt that would remain WAITING FOR GUFFMAN. But on subsequent viewings, I've changed my mind. This is a brilliant film. The fact that it's painted in subtler tones than the earlier Guest/Levy films could perhaps color one's opinion. There are some funny things and there are some amusing things and very, very little that misfires.Catherine O'Hara is particularly touching as a has-been who is given false hope for a comeback. Harry Shearer, ditto as a never-was. Parker Posey is the wannabe who pretends it means nothing but ditches her boyfriend because he KNOWS it means nothing. (The fact that he's the only one who does get a nomination is delicious irony.) And typically of Christopher Guest films, everyone who builds up hope eventually gets those hopes dashed at the end when a splash of cold reality hits them in the face.I highly recommend this to anyone who loves films about Hollywood.

""A New Yorker""","[0, 2]","I've never seen any of Christopher Guest's work but ""For Your Consideration"" shouldn't be considered for much, other than a poorly cast misfire not quite eligible for a razzie. The story revolves around several characters all involved in one way or another with the making of a film in Hollywood. We see parts of the film being shot interspersed with snippets from a fake ""Entertainment Tonight""-like show. Some of the main characters in the film within the film soon generate a bit of Oscar buzz and hopes and desires are brought to true life as the day of nomination announcements draw closer.I found the whole thing to be pretty drab and unpolished. I get the jabs at Hollywood and its pretentious, procedural stiffness, but everything in the movie feels so fake and contrived that I just sat with my jaw open most of the time trying to figure out what is so not funny about all of this. The actors are so completely miscast that I wonder if Guest owes something to these people or does he just enjoy their company so much that he had to hire them for these roles, then mix them up to play completely the wrong parts. One example of this would be Fred Willard, who is usually hilarious for his boy-like, clueless nature playing an over the top entertainment show host that is so ridiculous that it isn't even funny.

For example, during a scene with extensive foreground action, very often characters are pantomiming incredibly funny stuff in the background, lampooning the methods and mores of the movie business.It's funny, but it does require a lot of attention on the part of the viewer.

Hinton ""avid reader""","[3, 3]","In For Your Consideration, Christopher Guest and his always-funny group of improv actors go behind the scenes of a movie set where a struggling director is attempting to make his masterpiece. The film, Home for Purim, is about a 1940's family in the South and their struggles. The big plot of the film, however, comes from the actors' reactions to the news that their performances are generating Oscar buzz. They are unapologetically vain, with the exception of Catherine O'Hara who makes no secret of her desire for a little gold statute but at least has the grace to seem embarrassed whenever it's mentioned, and their frantic reations to the publicity are the funniest parts of the film.I'm a big fan of Christopher Guest's early stuff (eg, Spinal Tap, Best In Show, Waiting for Guffman), but for some reason his last two efforts have left me disappointed. I fell asleep when I saw A Mighty Wind in the theater and For Your Consideration left me equally underwhelmed. I don't know what it is. It's the same stellar cast that has always worked for me before, and FYC even adds one of my favorite comedians, Ricky Gervais (from the British version of the Office), but it still just didn't do it for me. Don't get me wrong, it definitely had its moments: Parker Posey's monologue to her dying mother where she comes out as a lesbian was hilarious, and Catherine O'Hara's role as an actress who is quite openly in it for the Oscar was honest and amusing. But overall, it just wasn't there. I've never laughed so hard as I do when I watch Best In Show, every single time even though I have to have seen it at least 20 times by now.

We see a really bad, low-budget movie called, ""Home for Purim"" being made by a motley collection of actors, writers, publicists, make-up artists, etc.  One by one the actors hear they might be on the short-list for an Oscar nod so they make the talk-show circuit and await the official announcement.I liked that this movie was less a mockumentary and more of a straight movie; although writer/director/star Guest is known for having his actors improvise the dialogue, this seemed more scripted and conventional.

And although some of the perennial comic favorites (Ed Begley Jr., John Michael Higgins, Jennifer Coolidge, Eugene Levy) of moviemaker Christopher Guest all show well here, the movie itself is a mess.  Guest moved away from mockumentaries to straight comedy, and his running joke is how serious film participants take the ""Oscar"" business.  Even really, really bad movies (as Guest's fake ""Home for Purim"" is) and their casts have uniquely silly reactions to the thought that some performances/characters may have a chance at an award nomination.  Their motivation becomes awards, not filmmaking.I attended the first showing of the film here in Tampa on Wednesday, along with half a theater full of people who enjoyed Guest's past efforts; his cynicism mixed with zany performances and wistfulness for topic material (stage productions, dog shows, bluegrass music).  We laughed loudly at bit parts (e.g. when a beloved character finally shows up on screen,or our first glance at Catherine O'Hara's character in her ""Oscar-waiting"" incarnation, complete with breast implants and botox.)We tittered a little at not unexpected complications, (as when the film's character is changed from Purim to Thanksgiving to draw down its ""ethnicity"" as per studio instructions). We waited for the subtle humor to set in and then really take off.  And then we sat, wide-eyed, as Guest closed out the movie with a ton of loose ends and laid an egg. We looked at each other, embarrassed that we'd come to the movie with such high expectations, trying to find some way of liking it.  There is none.  It feels like he lost interest, and let me tell you, the incredible early praise he's received from many film reviewers is all just crap.  If you're a Guest enthusiast, you'll be dismayed at this effort.  If you know nothing of Guest and see this movie because you'd love a subtle comedy....you won't find it.  If you, as I did, take a good friend or relative that you've been trying to interest in Guest's work....well, you may never live it down!Just awful.

This is not to say that it is an abject failure, but it certainly falls below the standard of the other films in his franchise.  Previous films of Guest's have been Horatian satires - that is, rather gentle in their satire.  This is more vitriolic and, while this type of Juvenalian/Swiftian satire might work with others, it certainly does not work here.  The ending is especially a let down as we watch the dreams of several of the characters fall into a nightmarish reality.  I would say that about ten minutes of this film is funny, the rest is misdirected and not well-thought out.The entire conceit concerning the film within the film is flawed as certain critics within the film laud its virtues, yet what we see of it looks like a made for TV film (and not a very good one).  In other words &#34;Home For Purim&#34; (or &#34;Home for Thanksgiving&#34;) is the kind of film that would NEVER find financing, that would only earn derision if it were pitched before any producers.  In &#34;The Mighty Wind&#34; the songs and singers were fairly good so that we could understand why they were able to fill Town Hall.

Sherwin,"[3, 5]","For Your Consideration tries to be a comedy that pokes fun relentlessly at the people and the politics of the movie industry---but it never really arrives. As one reviewer notes, it DOES appear that the director and maybe even the cast just plain lost interest in making this one fly. They released an egg instead.The casting is actually quite good; we get Parker Posey as a newcomer movie actress named Callie Webb, Catherine O'Hara as an aging and faded starlet actress named Marilyn Hack and Harry Shearer as the never quite made it actor Victor Allan Miller. Marilyn, Callie and Victor play the principle actors in an indie movie being made entitled Home For Purim.  Things are going along just average--until, that is, rumors abound that Marilyn Hack (Catherine O'Hara) will be nominated for an Oscar for her performance in the movie. Of course, things heat up when both Callie Webb (Parker Posey) and Victor Allen Miller (Harry Shearer) hear that one of them may get an Oscar nomination, too. Inevitably, almost everyone involved with the production of the film greedily smells a sleeper hit and tries to mold the movie into something more mainstream to increase the chances of it making it somewhere into ""Oscarland.""Unfortunately the jokes don't work too much of the time. ""Hollywood Now"" anchors Chuck Porter (Fred Willard) and Cindy Martin (Jane Lynch) represent a half-baked attempt to spoof Hollywood gossip TV shows; but their talents are somewhat wasted by the flat script. I found it mildly amusing that the studio changes the name from Home For Purim to Home For Thanksgiving; and the histrionics of newcomer actress Callie Webb are so exaggerated that they are often campy. The plot twists and turns a bit as relationships between the principle actors in the film are changed very quickly by just the rumors of an Oscar nomination. And, of course, the Home For Purim script writers become increasingly uncomfortable as their ""baby,"" their movie script, changes more and more into something they never intended it to be.The choreography reflects good judgment; I liked the crowd scenes on the studio lots and the ""movie within the movie"" is handled very neatly by the choreographers. At the same time the cinematography shines best when we get the movie within the movie scenes as well as the talk show scenes.I wish I could say that the movie jokes were hilarious and that the convincing acting shined brightly. However, I can't. The mostly tepid jokes didn't give a single belly laugh; and I agree with the reviewer who writes that Catherine O'Hara probably does give the best performance of all the actors in this film. It's a real shame, too--movies about Hollywood and the film industry have so much potential; and it feels as if this movie project was either too neglected or a product of people too scared to take the chances necessary to do this movie the way it should have been done.The DVD has some deleted scenes and some optional commentary; but otherwise the extras are remarkably slim. I would have liked a featurette about the making of this movie; but it's not there.Overall, Home For Purim taxis down the runway--and then stops short, never taking off. I felt disappointed because the movie had so much potential, especially with the fine actors they chose for these roles. I give it three stars--one star for choreography, a second star for cinematography and a third star for actors who would have been truly great in their roles if they had been given the right script to work with. Rent it if you must; but I wouldn't buy it.

1042225,A1RPTVW5VEOSI,B000M341Q4,Michael J. Edelman,"[2, 2]","Coming off of their wonderful ""A Mighty Wind"", the McKean et al improvisational troupe decided to try something different from their usual mock documentary style- a straight story with comedy *and* a bit of drama and pathos. Problem is, it doesn't work. They've got the usual troupe of talented actors, and the usual reliance on improvisation, but what they don't have is a very tight story line, or very tight editing for that matter. The result is a bit of a mess.Individually, the scenes- which are more like like comic skits- are not bad- at least, most of them are not bad. Some are laugh out loud funny. A few of them just fall flat. Most are somewhere in the middle- not terribly funny but just amusing enough to keep you watching. The actors don't all appear to be on the same page, either- or in the same movie. Some, like Eugene Levy, are playing for broad comedy. Others are going for a more dramatic approach. The overall effect is that the film never quite allows the viewer to step back and commit to a willing suspension of disbelief. It's as if all the actors say their lines, turn, and then wink to the audience.Overall the feeling is one of detached amusement- you don't really care about any of the characters. They're all cartoons. When the movie tries for drama or pathos, as it does on a number of occasions, it doesn't work for the simple reason that we don't care about any of the characters. The one character who comes closest to being able to connect with the audience is the actress played by Catherine O'Hara, but before we get to her big moment of pathos, she, too, has been turned into an object of ridicule- and so when the directors wants us to sympathize with her, we have no reason to.As in many previous movies from this company, there's a point at which the story peaks, and we get a ""three months later..."" subtitle on the screen. The viewer expects a short wrapping up of the story lines- yet it goes on, and on, dragging out some stories and leaving the viewer completely up in the air on others.All in all, a mess. No matter how much you may have liked ""A Might Wind"" or ""Best in Show"", skip this one.",2,A Mighty Disappointment,1255219200,"10 11, 2009",2009,2142,"['Coming', 'wonderful', 'A', 'Mighty', 'Wind', 'McKean', 'al', 'improvisational', 'troupe', 'decided', 'try', 'something', 'different', 'usual', 'mock', 'documentary', 'style-', 'straight', 'story', 'comedy', '*and*', 'bit', 'drama', 'pathos', 'Problem', ""n't"", 'work', ""'ve"", 'got', 'usual', 'troupe', 'talented', 'actors', 'usual', 'reliance', 'improvisation', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'very', 'tight', 'story', 'line', 'very', 'tight', 'editing', 'matter', 'result', 'bit', 'mess.Individually', 'scenes-', 'are', 'more', 'comic', 'skits-', 'are', 'not', 'bad-', 'least', 'most', 'are', 'not', 'bad', 'are', 'laugh', 'loud', 'funny', 'few', 'just', 'fall', 'flat', 'Most', 'are', 'somewhere', 'middle-', 'not', 'terribly', 'funny', 'just', 'amusing', 'enough', 'keep', 'watching', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'all', 'appear', 'be', 'same', 'page', 'either-', 'same', 'movie', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'are', 'playing', 'broad', 'comedy', 'Others', 'are', 'going', 'more', 'dramatic', 'approach', 'overall', 'effect', 'film', 'never', 'quite', 'viewer', 'step', 'back', 'commit', 'willing', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'actors', 'say', 'lines', 'turn', 'then', 'wink', 'audience.Overall', 'feeling', 'one', 'detached', 'amusement-', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'characters', ""'re"", 'cartoons', 'When', 'movie', 'drama', 'pathos', 'number', 'occasions', ""n't"", 'work', 'simple', 'reason', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'characters', 'one', 'character', 'who', 'closest', 'being', 'able', 'connect', 'audience', 'actress', 'played', 'Catherine', ""O'Hara"", 'get', 'big', 'moment', 'pathos', 'too', 'been', 'turned', 'object', 'ridicule-', 'so', 'when', 'directors', 'sympathize', 'have', 'reason', 'to.As', 'many', 'previous', 'movies', 'company', 'point', 'story', 'peaks', 'get', 'three', 'months', 'later', 'subtitle', 'screen', 'viewer', 'short', 'wrapping', 'story', 'lines-', 'yet', 'dragging', 'out', 'stories', 'leaving', 'viewer', 'completely', 'air', 'others.All', 'mess', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'may', 'have', 'liked', 'Might', 'Wind', 'Best', 'Show', 'skip', 'one']",For Your Consideration

However, in his latest outing he fails to reach those heights, even if he makes a movie which is still intermittently mirthsome and has some heart to go with the satire.The mockumentary style is toned down a little, making this a slightly more conventional film than usual.  When the cast of has-beens and preening wannabes of a new B-movie `Home For Purim' find out that they are generating Oscar buzz, they start to believe the hype and act in increasingly erratic ways as their egos clash with the artificiality of Hollywood chat shows, agents, and producers.There is definitely some genuine wit here - `Oscars - the backbone of an industry that doesn't have a backbone', but some characters work better than others, and there are few really scathing moments you'll remember long after the movie.  (`French movies? Hate the subtitles... I keep thinking I am watching breaking news...').Highlights include the truly dreadfully shallow Hollywood chat show presenters, and more especially the actors strained smiles as they listen to unforgivably crass questions coming their way.  The moment when the show goes out to interview the `losers' who were not nominated is terrific, and seals the deal to turn warm smiles into chuckles for this reviewer.  Best of all is the cameo from Ricky Gervais, the studio director who asks if it is possible to `tone down the Jewishness'.A success then, worth watching, just not a rolling in the aisles laugh-fest.",3,Quietly amusing mocumentary satire of Hollywood,1203465600,"02 20, 2008",2008,1561,"['Christopher', 'Guest', 'set', 'high', 'bar', 'mockumentaries', 'likes', 'Best', 'Show', 'course', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'However', 'latest', 'outing', 'reach', 'heights', 'even', 'movie', 'still', 'intermittently', 'mirthsome', 'heart', 'go', 'satire.The', 'mockumentary', 'style', 'toned', 'down', 'little', 'making', 'slightly', 'more', 'conventional', 'film', 'usual', 'When', 'cast', 'has-beens', 'preening', 'wannabes', 'new', 'B-movie', 'Home', 'Purim', 'find', 'out', 'are', 'generating', 'Oscar', 'buzz', 'start', 'believe', 'hype', 'act', 'increasingly', 'erratic', 'ways', 'egos', 'clash', 'artificiality', 'Hollywood', 'chat', 'agents', 'producers.There', 'definitely', 'genuine', 'wit', 'here', 'Oscars', 'backbone', 'industry', ""n't"", 'have', 'backbone', 'characters', 'work', 'better', 'others', 'are', 'few', 'really', 'scathing', 'moments', ""'ll"", 'remember', 'long', 'movie', 'French', 'movies', 'Hate', 'subtitles', 'keep', 'thinking', 'am', 'watching', 'breaking', 'news', '.Highlights', 'include', 'truly', 'dreadfully', 'shallow', 'Hollywood', 'chat', 'show', 'presenters', 'more', 'especially', 'actors', 'strained', 'smiles', 'listen', 'unforgivably', 'crass', 'questions', 'coming', 'way', 'moment', 'when', 'show', 'out', 'interview', 'losers', 'who', 'were', 'not', 'nominated', 'terrific', 'deal', 'turn', 'warm', 'smiles', 'chuckles', 'reviewer', 'Best', 'cameo', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', 'studio', 'director', 'who', 'possible', 'tone', 'down', ""Jewishness'.A"", 'success', 'then', 'worth', 'watching', 'just', 'not', 'rolling', 'aisles', 'laugh-fest']",For Your Consideration

He is a member of the English aristocracy-- I am a dyed-in-the wool Anglophile.  He can act, produce, direct,and write music.  I have acted, and I have written many melodies.He is a Liberal.  I am a Moderate, who can see good in ALL well-mean-ing people.  He is married to the American actress, Jamie Lee Curtis.I am an American, born in Brooklyn, New York!So you would think I would be excited, delighted, and thrilled to seemy first Christopher Guest film.  And I really was -- until I saw themovie.  I am very, very sad to say that ""For Your Consideration"" wasone of the three worst films I have ever seen.  (I KNOW there must beat least two other films I disliked as much....I just can't seem tothink of their names at the moment....)This ""comedy"" did not make me laugh once.  Some the actors tried hardto make a go of this lame movie.  (Forgive me, parapalegics, butseems to be the only term that will fit here -- and no human para-palegic -- or quadraplegic -- could ever be as ""lame"" as this movieis.)  But no actor -- not even Sir Laurence Olivier -- could makethis agonizing movie shine for the audience.I have tried, very hard, to find SOME good scenes in this movie.  Andyou know what -- I actually have!  ( :  The ""telephone answeringmachine message"" scene was very well done, and very well directed!""The Purim Song"" has a nice, authentic-without-being embarrassingmelody, good words, and a nice rendition.  The ""Change-the-nameArgument"" scene is good, and points out some all-too-painful truths.And Catherine O'Hara, (or is that her make-up artist and hairstylist?),does/do show how to look younger and younger, with surprisingly fewhair and make-up changes.)Even in a desert, one can find an oasis or two.  But there is nothinghere that you can't see in other, far better movies.This is a ""Warner Independent Pictures"" film.  I had never heard ofWIP films before, and have seen none of them.  But the very label of""Warner Independent Pictures"", (especially as applied to ""For YourConsideration""), cannot help but make me think of the words, usuallygiven just before a TV infomercial is seen, which go something like:""The following is a paid advertisement.  It represents the opinionsof the manufacturers and producers.  This station has no responsibil-ity as to what us being said.""  I may be very wrong here, but seemsto me that Warner Brothers, in classifying, ""For Your Consideration"",as a Warner Independent Film, wanted as little responsibility for thecontents as possible.  In my opinion, sadly, with good reason.As I mentioned, this is the very first Christopher Guest movie I haveever seen.  Because of his reputation, because I am a fan of his, andbecause of the glowing reviews of his other films, it will NOT be thelast one I see.  On the contrary, I intend to see ALL his other films!Everyone is entitled to one mistake, after all.  ""For Your Consider-ation"", has got to be Christopher Guest's one mistake.  Unfunny andverging on boring audiences into a stupour, Mr. Guest did not just""lay an egg"" here.  No -- although it truly pains me to say so --""For Your Consideration"", instead resembles a chicken-farm, where eggsare laid by the tens of dozens every day. ) :P.S.  I got this DVD from the library -- I didn't waste a cent on it!The best parts of this DVD -- for me, anyway -- were previews forthree other Warner Brothers films: ""The Painted Veil"", ""Words andMusic"", and ""Lucky You"".  All are very different from each other --but each seems to be a good movie, which I'd be interested in seeing!Especially when viewing ""For Your Consideration"", it's heartening toknow that there ARE movies, still being made, that are exciting,engrossing, and interesting to see!P.P.S.:  Better luck next time, Sir Christopher!  I KNOW that yourPOST-""For Your Consideration"" movies -- like your PRE-""For YourConsideration"" movies -- will be much, (and considerably!!!) betterthan this one, unfortunate goof!

1042239,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000M341Q4,Robert Moore,"[20, 22]","Bad news, good news.  Bad news first:  this is probably Christopher Guest's weakest film to date.  Good news:  it is still one of the funniest films of the year.  If you are a fan of WAITING FOR GUFFMAN, BEST IN SHOW, and A MIGHTY WIND, you will find many things in this movie to love and even more to laugh at, though it almost certainly won't rival any of those for your affection.  Part of the reason is the dropping of the documentary style of the earlier films.  Here the camera has to assume a more detached, less ironic pose, and something is lost as a result.  Still, Guest's touch is definitely still present throughout mot of the film, and although it is definitely a step below his other films, it is by no means a deep disappointment.FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION tells the story of the filming of the Hollywood movie HOME FOR PURIM, a period film set during WW II telling the story of the dying mother in a Jewish family living in the deep South.  One of the first truly funny, weird moments comes when this Southern film-family, with their deep drawls, start dropping Yiddish words into their conversation.  While filming the buzz that one or more of the actors might get Oscar nominations -- perhaps sparked by a random comment in an Internet chat room (or as John Michael Higgins's character puts it:  the World Wide Interweb) -- and upper level studio execs step in and change the film from the ethnic HOME FOR PURIM and turn it into HOME FOR THANKSGIVING.  The latter part of the film deals with the nervous anticipation of the rumored Oscar nominations.If you have seen any of Christopher Guest's other films, you pretty much know who stars in this.  They are all the usual suspects:  Catherine O'Hara plays the aging actress who portrays the dying mother in the fictitious film.  She is as wonderful as always and some of her funniest moments come after filming is complete and she gets excessive botox injections to give her a younger look.  Harry Shearer plays veteran voice over artist and sometimes stage actor Victor Allen Miller, who wonders if his role in the film is finally his big break (the voice over artist aspect of his character is interesting since Shearer is one of the great voice over artists of his generation due to his work on THE SIMPSONS).  The always-marvelous Parker Posey plays in the film within the film the estranged lesbian daughter (I had never before noticed what a striking resemblance she and Kristen Bell bear to one another, hair color aside).  Eugene Levy was not only the co-author of the script but plays Victor Allen Miller's agent.  Then there are simply a vast number of familiar faces such as Jennifer Coolidge, Jane Lynch, Michael McKean, Ed Begley Jr., the aforementioned John Michael Higgins, Bob Balaban, Larry Miller, Michael Hitchcock, Don Lake, and probably a half dozen other performers I'm missing.  Christopher Guest interesting both directed the film and plays the director of the film with the film.  And what would any Christopher Guest project be without occasions for a host of opportunities for scene stealing by Fred Willard, who here plays an entertainment show co-host (along with Jane Lynch) and sports a most bizarre hair cut.  There are also some welcome guest stars who are not familiar faces in the Guest universe.  In fact, two of them provide a double tie-in to THE OFFICE, though to two different versions.  In a fake movie review show, a clip from a truly awful looking cop show features John Krasinki, Jim in the NBC version of THE OFFICE, as a cop who is accused of doing a poor job with his paperwork.  But in a much larger role, Ricky Gervais, creator and star of the BBC original version, is outstanding as an oily studio exec.  He fits in perfectly with the rest of the performers.  There is also a very small and more or less wasted appearance by the always-lovely Sandra Oh.I will be amazed if any fans of Guest's films will be completely disappoint with this film, though I also expect that most will rate this a bit below the other films.

The wonderful mix of subtle jabs using wonderful improved lines and wacky characters is on display here.  At the same time, the film is lacking a spark that could have really made it take off.One of the major changes is that the film is not shot like a documentary (as most of Guest's previous films have been).  Instead the movie is shot straight.  It's a movie about movie making, like ""The Player"".  At the same time we see some of Guest's typical framing and camera movement carrying over.  It's not a bad thing, but it seems a bit out of place.What you can't argue with is the cast.  Catherine O'Hara and Harry Shearer are the stand outs here.  They make you laugh, shake your head and feel bad for them almost all at the same time.  Parker Posey and Eugene Levy also provide some good laughs with their characters.  But the cast is huge, with so many funny bit players and surreal moments its impossible to log them all here.  And that might be part of the problem, because in the end the movie feels very short.  There seems to be plenty of good material here (the deleted scenes on the DVD attest to that), but Guest trimmed lots of it away.In the end, the movie entertains, but is quickly forgotten.  Most of Guest's other movies have classic moments, or lines that you can rattle off at a moments notice.  ""For Your Consideration"" misses the boat.

It seems the Christopher Guest series might be running out of steam.We have here most of the trademark qualities of other Guest films such as ""Waiting for Guffman"" and ""A Mighty Wind."" We have the gentle spoofing of people's self-involvement. We have a cast of characters whose conversational gambits always seem to just sail past each other, failing to stop and make a rescue of the other's droll drowning.  We have affectation and eccentricity.And the movie's premise is interesting enough. This is a film about the film industry. More specifically, it's about the Hollywood rumor mill, which in this case starts churning out Oscar buzz over an obviously very Grade B historical film that the Guest characters are all involved in producing. Everyone's hopes are raised; everyone's egos get further inflated.But somehow, this time most of it just doesn't ring true. It's all like the spiky Mohawk hairdo Fred Willard sports as host of a morning talk show. It just wouldn't happen.

And he's the director four of the funnier movies in the last decade. And yet Christopher Guest still has the reputation of being an acquired comedic taste.Is it because he mixes wit and satire into his broad comedy? Or because his work doesn't transmit on the lowest common frequency? I noticed selections of the Adam Sandler film canon on TV 27,235 times during Thanksgiving weekend. I still can't make time for an anti-social man-child with a fake angry voice. But Guest I get.His latest is ""For Your Consideration,"" a send-up of Hollywood and everything involved with it: The actors, the publicists, the agents, those perky, stupid entertainment shows.  Dopey and sweet, it's not quite as sharp as Guest's best efforts, ""Waiting For Guffman"" and ""Best In Show."" But it's smart and funny, and features one creepy, impressive performance from Catherine O'Hara, a staple of Guest's ensemble pieces.That O'Hara is good enough for awards consideration is clever considering her character, Marilyn Hack, is a successful-but-unheralded actor before she stars in ""Home For Purim,"" a minor studio movie that's suddenly  getting Oscar buzz.Mix ""Gone With The Wind,"" a weepy like ""One True Thing"" and Jewish culture, and you have ""Home For Purim,"" a melodrama about a dying matriarch, her nervous husband and  a rebellious, gay daughter.  It's not just bad, it's bizarre. You are unlikely to hear the phrase ""dang mitzvah"" again in your life.Nevertheless, some Internet spy visited the set and posted the Oscar buzz, and it isn't long before the guy who plays the father,  Victor Allan Miller (Harry Shearer) and the woman who plays  rebellious daughter, Callie Webb, (Parker Posey) soak up the same adulation. On one level, ""For Your Consideration"" is about how the buzz changes these otherwise decent people. On another, it's an attack about the idiocy of Hollywood.Guest has jabbed Hollywood once before with ""The Big Picture,"" a seriocomic Kevin Bacon/Teri Hatcher vehicle that's worth a rent. But here, with co-writer Eugene Levy, he's mostly poking gently with his usual cast of ensemble actors. Fred Willard and Jane Lynch do a perfect impersonation of entertainment show hosts. John Michael Higgins is an out-of-touch publicist.  Levy is a small-time agent. Jennifer Coolidge plays the ditzy producer, Whitney Brown.You see these actors and smile, because they're familiar, they're funny, and Guest puts them in a position to riff off of each other. O'Hara is the most gifted actor of the bunch - always has been - but Posey's the real comedian, She's courageous, too for repeatedly making herself a slightly deranged nut job in Guest's films. Here she seems to have a better bearing until you see her one-woman show ""No Penis Intended.""

Long story short, those expectations were dashed.""For Your Consideration"" has all the hallmarks of the usual success for Guest and his team gifted comics.  Inherently ridiculous people (B-minus list actors and filmmakers) throw themselves with gusto into a ridiculous activity (making a third-rate drama) with no knowledge of how ridiculous they are.  This was the engine for all the other great Guest movies.  So what went wrong?Quite simply, Hollywood has already sent itself up a gazillion times.  We really hadn't seen rock-n-roll skewered as it was in ""Spinal Tap,"" and to be sure ""Best in Show"" has done wonders bringing attention to the Eukenuba World Dog Championships.  But when it comes to making fun of Hollywood, it's been done before, and done very well - ""Get Shorty,"" ""Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang,"" and ""Swimming With Sharks"" leap to mind as recent successful takes on the Hollywood lifestyle . . . and then there's Robert Altman's ""The Player.""So what could Guest and his team do this time around?  Answer - not much.  They have a clever plot - what happens when terrible actors start seriously believing that they have a shot at an Oscar?  But we have seen the vain actor skewered so many times that nothing really comes across as inspired.  Well, there's one exception - Catherine O'Hara's transformation from aging has-been actress to botox-and-silicon-enhanced Bo Derek clone is just priceless.  It's also a wee bit scary.True to form, there are some classic one-liners in ""FYC"" that you will remember for a long time (""We don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater, because it leaves you with a wet, critically injured baby,"" is a personal favorite.)  But for Guest movies, we expect so much more.There are those who say that a bad Christopher Guest comedy is much funnier than the average comedy released by Hollywood today.

However, I did get around to it eventually, and even though I wasn't highly anticipating it, it still was a letdown.  I love improv, and this group he's put together is good, but honestly the quality keeps dropping from each project to the next, this being the most noticeable.Guest and Eugene Levy are fine writers and comedians, but it just felt like they thought they had a good enough idea and enough trust in the ensemble cast to make it funnier than it really was.  The idea being a low budget indie called ""Home For Purim"" with relative unknowns (a washed up actress, a famous tv commercial personality who dresses up like a hot dog) who are all delighted to hear that there is some serious Oscar buzz surrounding their movie.  An Access Hollywood type show covers the story and fuels the award flames.  This cause a lot of strife on set, such as diva like behavior with actors feeling like they are in competition over Oscar attention and break ups over jealousy, etc.I genuinely like a lot of the cast.  Parker Posey is always good, Catherine O'Hara does fine, Fred Willard is always good for a laugh.  Unfortunately for this movie it's starting to feel like Guest, McKean, and Shearer are coasting on their Spinal Tap fame.  One thing that I think really could have elevated the material is if they had shot it fake documentary style like previous efforts with a few interviews thrown in there.  They should have pushed the behind-the-scenes feel of it since it has proven to serve them well before.  Honestly it was not that bad of an idea, it just wasn't funny or well executed.  I enjoy subtle humor in all it's forms, but this just felt like lazy writing.I am impressed that this cast has stayed together for so long and been able to generate as much laughter over the years as they have, but I have to admit, whatever trick they pull out next, it better be a good one to redeem themselves for this.",2,Guest is slipping,1188864000,"09 4, 2007",2007,2042,"['do', ""n't"", 'claim', 'be', 'huge', 'Christopher', 'Guest', 'fan', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'one', 'movies', 'theaters', 'one', 'was', 'different', 'However', 'did', 'get', 'eventually', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'highly', 'anticipating', 'still', 'was', 'letdown', 'love', 'improv', 'group', 'put', 'together', 'good', 'honestly', 'quality', 'dropping', 'project', 'next', 'being', 'most', 'noticeable.Guest', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'are', 'fine', 'writers', 'comedians', 'just', 'felt', 'thought', 'had', 'good', 'enough', 'idea', 'enough', 'trust', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'make', 'funnier', 'really', 'was', 'idea', 'being', 'low', 'budget', 'indie', 'called', 'Home', 'Purim', 'relative', 'unknowns', 'washed', 'up', 'actress', 'famous', 'tv', 'commercial', 'personality', 'who', 'up', 'hot', 'dog', 'who', 'are', 'delighted', 'hear', 'serious', 'Oscar', 'buzz', 'surrounding', 'movie', 'Access', 'Hollywood', 'type', 'show', 'story', 'fuels', 'award', 'cause', 'lot', 'strife', 'set', 'such', 'diva', 'behavior', 'actors', 'feeling', 'are', 'competition', 'Oscar', 'attention', 'break', 'ups', 'jealousy', 'etc.I', 'genuinely', 'lot', 'cast', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'always', 'good', 'Catherine', ""O'Hara"", 'fine', 'Fred', 'Willard', 'always', 'good', 'laugh', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'starting', 'feel', 'Guest', 'McKean', 'Shearer', 'are', 'coasting', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'fame', 'One', 'thing', 'think', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'elevated', 'material', 'had', 'shot', 'fake', 'documentary', 'style', 'previous', 'efforts', 'few', 'interviews', 'thrown', 'there', 'should', 'have', 'pushed', 'behind-the-scenes', 'feel', 'proven', 'serve', 'well', 'before', 'Honestly', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'idea', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'well', 'executed', 'enjoy', 'subtle', 'humor', 'forms', 'just', 'felt', 'lazy', 'writing.I', 'am', 'impressed', 'cast', 'stayed', 'together', 'so', 'long', 'been', 'able', 'generate', 'much', 'laughter', 'years', 'have', 'have', 'admit', 'trick', 'pull', 'out', 'next', 'better', 'be', 'good', 'one', 'redeem']",For Your Consideration

1042250,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000M341Q4,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[3, 7]","***An independently produced film, ""Home for Purim"", set in the American South, during the 1940's, begins receiving Oscar buzz for the three leads. Marilyn Hack (Catherine O'Hara), a struggling actress in the business for a long time, plays the dying mother who only wants to be reunited with her daughter. When she gets a whiff of the Oscar buzz, she stokes the flames, desperate for a last chance at stardom. When her costar, Victor Alan Miller (Harry Shearer), most famous as the mascot for a Hebrew hot dog, appears on a morning talk show with her, the male host states he thinks Victor is turning in an Oscar worthy performance. Then, `Hollywood Now' hosts Chuck Porter and Cindy Martin (Fred Willard and Jane Lynch, ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"") catch the story and start pushing Callie Webb (Parker Posey), their co-star, for an Oscar as well. Naturally, this turns the small, admittedly bad, film into another beast entirely. Jay Berman (Christopher Guest), the film's director, doesn't seem to notice and only wants the light to be brighter. Whitney Taylor Brown (Jennifer Coolidge), the film's producer, a dumb blond who inherited a lot of money from her family's diaper service, the Brown Diaper Service, uses her money to finance the film, simply for the opportunity to appear in the spotlight. When the Oscar buzz makes its way around town, studio executive Martin Gibb (Ricky Gervais) makes an appearance and requests some changes, to increase the audience. ""Remove the Jewishness, and people will come to see it.""""For Your Consideration"", from writer/ director Christopher Guest and co-writer Eugene Levy, the team behind ""This is Spinal Tap"", ""Waiting for Guffman"", ""Best in Show"" and ""The Mighty Wind"", have assembled their repertory group of familiar faces, all of whom take on different wacky personas in this skewed universe.But ""For Your Consideration"" is not as successful as their other recent films.First and foremost, the film takes forever to get going. The film begins with Marilyn Hack, as she watches ""Jezebel"" on television, presumably to prepare for the role she is playing in the film. Then she has trouble at the front gate. Then we meet Jay, the director. He does not possess much talent; he wants Marilyn to add a weird facial tic during her big dramatic scene. Then we meet Victor, the aging star; he is having trouble getting his agent, Morley Orfkin (Eugene Levy), to take his calls and get him some work. Corey Taft (John Michael Higgins), a desperate public relations man, seems to realize what a loser this film is, yet he is ready to kick the PR machine into full gear if necessary. Then we meet Whitney Taylor Brown, who has survived a strange accident and must remain seated in a special chair that makes her look like she is standing. She relies on her assistant (Jordan Black) for his opinion in helping her make decisions. The film cycles through these characters, setting them up in brief tableaus before moving on to another character or combination of characters. With each tableau, we are presumably drawn deeper into the story. Some introduce us to new characters, like ""Purim"" writers Lance Iverson and Philip Koontz (Michael McKean and Bob Balaban); two play writers who teach during the day and think they have presumably received their big break. But few of these brief scenes even manage a chuckle. Almost none elicit a laugh out loud moment.Because we are watching a series of scenes, they begin to resemble skits laced together for the benefit of the story. These moments also seem longer than they actually are, because they aren't achieving their goal, to make us laugh.""Consideration"" starts to become tedious very fast.Then, just as I thought I couldn't stand it anymore, the last twenty or thirty minutes have some laugh out loud moments. It almost seems like director Guest was using the rest of the film to set-up this brief period of payoff. Yeah, that's it.After spending so much time with these characters, we feel we are getting to know the depths of their desperation. And in the final act, we see the lengths they are willing to go to achieve these goals. This isn't some madcap moment, like you might find in ""A Fish called Wanda"" or other great ensemble comedies, the moments are quiet, quirky and funny.The only problem? You have to sit through an hour of very inside Hollywood jokes, well-thought out but unfunny characterizations and set-ups for jokes that don't pay off. Jay is a hack director, we get it. He is more interesting in getting fed than making a cinematic masterpiece. It seems odd that the weakest character in the film belongs to the director and co-writer.There are some standouts in the film. Catherine O'Hara is great, as usual. She actually appears to be trying to make Marilyn a real person. We can feel the woman's pain, her desperation as she strives to make ""Purim"" better than it has a right to be. She queries the cinematographer about the scenes. ""How did they look?"" she asks with more than a hint of desperation. When she hears there has been a mention of her performance on the internet, she fuels the flames of this rumor, asking people if they have heard it. Then, when the rumor mill is in full swing, she begins to prepare for her Oscar night performance in ways that are strange and unusual. O'Hara is great with this type of character, the desperate woman fighting for one last chance, and Guest seems to realize this. She has played this type of person in all of their collaborations. She is playing the one character who could, with a little tweaking, be at home in a drama.Jane Lynch and Fred Willard play Cindy Martin and Chuck Porter, the hosts of an ""Entertainment Tonight"", ""Access Hollywood"", and ""The Insider"" type of show. Cindy is more interested in looking great in front of the camera. Chuck seems resigned to his fate and doesn't really give a damn. Their scenes are dead on, capturing the look and feel of these type of programs. If anything, they are too kind. As Cindy reads the teleprompter for her part of the story, the edits become fast, with every move of her head. When Chuck is interviewing some of the cast members of ""Home for Purim"", he could care less and asks them completely obscure questions, having little, if anything to do with their work on the film.""Home for Purim"", is long the lines of the other projects featured in other Guest films. In ""Waiting for Guffman"", they were working on a terrible play. In ""A Mighty Wind"", a group of marginal folk singers get together for a reunion album. In ""Consideration"", they are making a film called ""Home for Purim"", set in the South, during the mid-40s. So, not only are the characters attempting broad, Tennessee Williams-esque accents, they have to use these same accents when speaking Yiddish words. It is a humorous idea. And the film will clearly be an atrocity, which is part of the point. There is no way these actors would ever be considered for an Oscar, so when they are, they are each surprised, but only mildly so. It is Hollywood after all. Guest clearly enjoys using these questionable projects to bring out the best (and worst) of his characters, to reveal the depth of their desperation.Ricky Gervais (British television's ""The Office"") pops up as the head of Sunfish Classics, the arm of a larger studio dedicated to making smaller more controversial films like ""Home for Purim"". When the news of the Oscar buzz reaches him, he makes an appearance on the set. Now that people might actually see this film, the film's tone is far too ethnic and he meets with Whitney Taylor Brown, to get them to tone it down, make a couple of changes. His role is funny, in a certain way, because it is so dead on. Everyone working in Hollywood knows this type of thing happens far too often. He nails the whole persona on the head. Late in the film, at a studio party, he begins hitting on Brown, an Amazonian blonde with little wits. The character is just perfect.Jennifer Coolidge is perhaps the most successful in her portrayal of a character. She is a dumb, rich blonde spending her inheritance on a film, to become a Hollywood producer. She is really dumb, really blond, and doesn't know what she is doing, at any point in her life. In almost all of her scenes, every time she speaks, she makes you laugh.But these standout moments are not as prevalent as they should be. Far too much of the film is spent waiting for laughter, wasted on lame jokes about the various characters not knowing about the Internet. In a comedy, we shouldn't be waiting for things to happen. We shouldn't be Waiting for Guffaws.",3,"The Laughs At The End of A Long, Hard Journey",1164844800,"11 30, 2006",2006,8596,"['***An', 'independently', 'produced', 'film', 'Home', 'Purim', 'set',

The workaround (i.e. THE PLOT) they present us with to get to the actual joke is so tedious and disturbing it's insane.And in NO WAY is it funny.Sure, they are poking fun at the event horizon of an online discussion by unknown people having any influence on the movie industry or the Academy... Sure, the film was pretty much a total impromptu session, but it's just plain boring and weird.Sure, weird is good. I like weird.

Geiger would have a hard time looking at. Truly disturbing.Performances are staggering and lack depth or confidence. Casting in some cases is just off the wall. And the ending? Just a couple of quick lines and hard cut to black with the credits. No conclusion, no resolution, no real motivation and just plain sad.Some people will like this film.

1042254,A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ,B000M341Q4,"Z. Freeman ""Zach""","[5, 9]","Christopher Guest has directed some brilliantly hilarious films: Waiting For Guffman, Best in Show, A Mighty Wind... but For Your Consideration does not belong on that list.First of all, For Your Consideration loses the mockumentary style Guest has worked with before, and this definitely detracts from the movie. (The best moments in this film are Fred Willard and Jane Lynch as E! Entertainment-esque hosts, and this may have to do with the fact that they are directing themselves towards the camera that they know is present).The main problem with this movie is that it tries to cover too much ground in too little time. There's too much going on and too many characters to keep up with. Also, there are far too many extended cuts of the actual scenes in the movie that is being made ""Home For Purim"". In Waiting For Guffman, showing the actual play worked, because the play was funny, here, the film is just vaguely uncomfortable and awkward.There are a few good laughs, mostly from Parker Posey. Catherine O'Hara creates such a real character that the film becomes depressing. For future reference: it's sad (not funny) to see an aging actress who thinks she has a shot at an Oscar get lipo and cry herself to sleep.This is one of those movies where when the credits role you're just left feeling a bit confused as to what just happened. Wasn't that supposed to be a comedy? Was that really the end? I think this film had a lot of potential (look at the cast and concept), but to me, it failed miserably.Oh, and Ricky Gervais delivers laughs, although he's just David Brent in America.",2,strangely depressing rather than funny,1164844800,"11 30, 2006",2006,1590,"['Christopher', 'Guest', 'directed', 'brilliantly', 'hilarious', 'films', 'Waiting', 'Guffman', 'Best', 'Show', 'A', 'Mighty', 'Wind', 'Consideration', 'not', 'belong', 'list.First', 'Consideration', 'mockumentary', 'style', 'Guest', 'worked', 'before', 'definitely', 'movie', 'best', 'moments', 'film', 'are', 'Fred', 'Willard', 'Jane', 'Lynch', 'E', 'Entertainment-esque', 'hosts', 'may', 'have', 'do', 'fact', 'are', 'directing', 'camera', 'know', 'present', '.The', 'main', 'problem', 'movie', 'cover', 'too', 'much', 'ground', 'too', 'little', 'time', 'too', 'much', 'going', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'keep', 'up', 'Also', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'extended', 'cuts', 'actual', 'scenes', 'movie', 'being', 'made', 'Home', 'Purim', 'Waiting', 'Guffman', 'showing', 'actual', 'play', 'worked', 'play', 'was', 'funny', 'here', 'film', 'just', 'vaguely', 'uncomfortable', 'are', 'few', 'good', 'laughs', 'mostly', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'Catherine', ""O'Hara"", 'real', 'character', 'film', 'depressing', 'future', 'reference', 'sad', 'not', 'funny', 'see', 'aging', 'actress', 'who', 'shot', 'Oscar', 'get', 'lipo', 'cry', 'sleep.This', 'one', 'movies', 'where', 'when', 'credits', 'role', ""'re"", 'just', 'left', 'feeling', 'bit', 'confused', 'what', 'just', 'happened', 'Was', ""n't"", 'that', 'supposed', 'be', 'comedy', 'Was', 'really', 'end', 'think', 'film', 'had', 'lot', 'potential', 'look', 'cast', 'concept', 'failed', 'miserably.Oh', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', 'delivers', 'laughs', 'just', 'David', 'Brent', 'America']",For Your Consideration
