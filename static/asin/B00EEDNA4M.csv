But the man becomes obsessed and evil.  He looses sight of his family and what is important in life.  At the final season, I couldn't continue to watch because I became obsessed with hatred towards Walt and the destructive powers he and meth had on his live and everyone around him.

1667001,A3GKD8MAHURH91,B00EEDNA4M,alltatup,"[1, 4]","If you aren't interested in a deeper analysis focusing on what ideology this series embraces as well as what it says about the state of our culture, then you better skip this. I have watched the series twice, and while I admire all of the technical brilliance, the dramatic intelligence and the humor of the creator Gilligan (who has clearly learned A LOT from Tarantino, but just doesn't quite have that much genius), there's a lot about the series that I despise such as its unabashedly stupid portrayal of women as idiots and its (intentional?) glorification of the worst of patriarchal culture (I will explain that below). Not only that, but there are too many holes in the plot where Gilligan simply doesn't have the know-how to provide consistent character development: too often, I find their reactions and behaviors contradictory, not credible and overly facile. For example, Skyler ends up making lots of decisions and going along with things that clearly put her children in danger: I just can't buy it.This series, along with Dexter, unveils the American hero as psychopath: a lying, narcissistic, murderous, stop-at-nothing psychopath who deceives and manipulates those he ostensibly loves for his own self-gratification, as Walt does finally admit. It goes right along with what I've been calling the Enronization of American culture for some time now: Jeff Skilling and Ken Lay as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, the role models for business as usual in this country. No one seems to care anymore when the Bernie Madoffs of the world do what they do, and I think in part it's because shows like BB induce an unconscious admiration for ""outlaws."" And anyone who thinks that tv shows don't ""teach"" viewers is, in my opinion, a naive and passive consumer.In many ways, BB is just another intimate portrait of the American family in all of its dysfunction: White plays his son off against his wife to get what he wants, and when he forces his son to drink until he vomits, we are expected to believe that Junior liked it. Skyler is willing to risk the welfare and lives of her children because, she maintains, she doesn't want Junior to find out that his dad cooks meth; puh leeze, that line of reasoning and deception makes her just about as psychopathic as her husband. Indeed, no one really has the welfare of the children at heart, and these are the kinds of character inconsistencies that make for a juicy story but don't go very far in terms of developing a truly believable and consistent portrait of who these folks are. Tv is famous for never expecting much intelligence from its viewers; tv is usually an exercise in mediocrity that celebrates and advocates passivity. In fact, the less thinking the audience does, the happier it will be plugged into passive consumption.What blows me away most of all is how reactionary this program really is with its celebration of the worst of patriarchal culture, and by that I mean its glorification of Walt's machismo (as when he blows up the guy's BMW or explodes Tuco's office: the little man/nerd as super-hero), its portrayal of Jesse as an appropriately passive pawn (called ""kid"" by most everyone) at the hands of the older White, and the portrayal of wives as handmaidens who cater to their husband's whims (and who are always ready with a hand job). Yes, the series seduced and fascinated me with its slick production, its fantastic sound track, its array of zany characters I can't help but like (the pianist Skinny Pete is one of my favorites) and its often intelligent and funny dialogue, BUT:I have to conclude that it's a symptom of just how pathological our culture is right now. Watching this show, deep in our hearts, we cheer for the 1% who make millions off of the heartless exploitation of everyone else in the world: that's what this show endorses at the bottom line. All we want is the chance to lay our bodies down on top of their millions. Walt is the hero who kills the Nazis and liberates Jesse at the end, we cheer when Jesse makes his getaway, and all of the brutalized, beaten, blown up, bloodied and bludgeoned bodies of those who were sacrificed to Walt and Jesse's madcap adventures cooking meth are forgotten in a cloud of dust. Maybe I am getting too old for this kind of show, or I still am and always will be a child of the sixties seeking a healthier and freer culture with much better options. This show celebrates egotism and an utter lack of unconcern for others.I'm going to have to stick with heroes like Atticus Finch, Elisabeth Bennet, To Sir with Love,  Newman and Redford and Tess McGill (Working Girl)... I just can't get with the program of rooting for psychopaths...",3,THE AMERICAN HERO AS PSYCHOPATH: A SOCIOLOGICAL TAKE ON THIS SERIES,1388880000,"01 5, 2014",2014,4678,"['are', ""n't"", 'interested', 'deeper', 'analysis', 'focusing', 'what', 'ideology', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'what', 'state', 'culture', 'then', 'better', 'skip', 'have', 'watched', 'series', 'twice', 'admire', 'technical', 'brilliance', 'dramatic', 'intelligence', 'humor', 'creator', 'Gilligan', 'who', 'clearly', 'learned', 'A', 'LOT', 'Tarantino', 'just', ""n't"", 'quite', 'have', 'much', 'genius', 'lot', 'series', 'despise', 'such', 'unabashedly', 'stupid', 'portrayal', 'women', 'idiots', 'intentional', 'glorification', 'worst', 'patriarchal', 'culture', 'will', 'explain', 'below', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'holes', 'plot', 'where', 'Gilligan', 'simply', ""n't"", 'have', 'know-how', 'provide', 'consistent', 'character', 'development', 'too', 'often', 'find', 'reactions', 'behaviors', 'contradictory', 'not', 'credible', 'overly', 'facile', 'example', 'Skyler', 'up', 'making', 'lots', 'decisions', 'going', 'along', 'things', 'clearly', 'put', 'children', 'danger', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'buy', 'it.This', 'series', 'Dexter', 'American', 'hero', 'psychopath', 'lying', 'narcissistic', 'murderous', 'stop-at-nothing', 'psychopath', 'who', 'manipulates', 'ostensibly', 'own', 'self-gratification', 'Walt', 'finally', 'admit', 'right', 'along', 'what', ""'ve"", 'been', 'calling', 'Enronization', 'American', 'culture', 'time', 'now', 'Jeff', 'Skilling', 'Ken', 'Lay', 'Butch', 'Cassidy', 'Sundance', 'Kid', 'role', 'models', 'business', 'usual', 'country', 'one', 'care', 'anymore', 'when', 'Bernie', 'Madoffs', 'world', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'think', 'part', 'shows', 'BB', 'induce', 'unconscious', 'admiration', 'outlaws', 'anyone', 'who', 'tv', 'shows', 'do', ""n't"", 'teach', 'viewers', 'opinion', 'naive', 'passive', 'consumer.In', 'many', 'ways', 'BB', 'just', 'intimate', 'portrait', 'American', 'family', 'dysfunction', 'White', 'son', 'off', 'wife', 'get', 'what', 'when', 'son', 'drink', 'are', 'expected', 'believe', 'Junior', 'liked', 'Skyler', 'willing', 'risk', 'welfare', 'lives', 'children', ""n't"", 'want', 'Junior', 'find', 'out', 'dad', 'meth', 'puh', 'leeze', 'line', 'reasoning', 'deception', 'just', 'as', 'psychopathic', 'husband', 'Indeed', 'one', 'really', 'welfare', 'children', 'heart', 'are', 'kinds', 'character', 'inconsistencies', 'make', 'juicy', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'very', 'far', 'terms', 'developing', 'truly', 'believable', 'consistent', 'portrait', 'who', 'folks', 'are', 'Tv', 'famous', 'never', 'expecting', 'much', 'intelligence', 'viewers', 'tv', 'usually', 'exercise', 'mediocrity', 'passivity', 'fact', 'less', 'thinking', 'audience', 'happier', 'will', 'be', 'plugged', 'passive', 'consumption.What', 'away', 'most', 'how', 'reactionary', 'program', 'really', 'celebration', 'worst', 'patriarchal', 'culture', 'mean', 'glorification', 'Walt', 'machismo', 'when', 'up', 'guy', 'BMW', 'Tuco', 'office', 'little', 'man/nerd', 'super-hero', 'portrayal', 'Jesse', 'appropriately', 'passive', 'pawn', 'called', 'kid', 'most', 'everyone', 'hands', 'older', 'White', 'portrayal', 'wives', 'handmaidens', 'who', 'cater', 'husband', 'whims', 'who', 'are', 'always', 'ready', 'hand', 'job', 'Yes', 'series', 'seduced', 'fascinated', 'slick', 'production', 'fantastic', 'sound', 'track', 'array', 'zany', 'characters', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'pianist', 'Skinny', 'Pete', 'one', 'favorites', 'often', 'intelligent', 'funny', 'dialogue', 'BUT', 'have', 'conclude', 'symptom', 'just', 'how', 'pathological', 'culture', 'right', 'now', 'Watching', 'show', 'deep', 'hearts', 'cheer', '1', '%', 'who', 'make', 'millions', 'heartless', 'exploitation', 'everyone', 'else', 'world', 'what', 'show', 'bottom', 'line', 'want', 'chance', 'lay', 'bodies', 'down', 'top', 'millions', 'Walt', 'hero', 'who', 'Nazis', 'Jesse', 'end', 'cheer', 'when', 'Jesse', 'getaway', 'brutalized', 'beaten', 'blown', 'up', 'bloodied', 'bludgeoned', 'bodies', 'who', 'were', 'sacrificed', 'Walt', 'Jesse', 'madcap', 'cooking', 'meth', 'are', 'forgotten', 'cloud', 'dust', 'Maybe', 'am', 'getting', 'too', 'old', 'kind', 'show', 'still', 'am', 'always', 'will', 'be', 'child', 'sixties', 'seeking', 'healthier', 'freer', 'culture', 'much', 'better', 'options', 'show', 'egotism', 'utter', 'lack', 'unconcern', 'others.I', ""'m"", 'going', 'have', 'stick', 'heroes', 'Atticus', 'Finch', 'Elisabeth', 'Bennet', 'Sir', 'Love', 'Newman', 'Redford', 'Tess', 'McGill', 'Working', 'Girl', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'program', 'rooting', 'psychopaths']",N/A
1667002,A1ZOF747O5EB6R,B00EEDNA4M,Andrew Desmond,"[1, 2]","Many people, myself included, are often critical of American television.  Predictable stories, weak characters, good triumphing over bad, etc.  Although much of this criticism is warranted, there are numerous exceptions to the rule.  &#8220;Breaking Bad&#8221; is certainly one of these exceptions.  Indeed, I regard the show as the best piece of television drama in the last twenty years.There are many reasons why &#8220;Breaking Bad&#8221; succeeds where others fail.  Indeed, the list is extensive but would include the compelling story lines, the acting, the unusual location (Albuquerque, New Mexico), the sometimes gritty visuals, and the subject matter itself, the drug trade.  All these bind together to create a magnificent series.Without in any way spoiling it for readers of this review, the plot centres on one Walter White, a kind of dorky high school chemistry teacher.  He is diagnosed with lung cancer and, in trying to provide for his family in the event of his death, turns to the extremely lucrative business of cooking crystal meth.  At this task, he is brilliant.  However, along the way, the nature of the trade is that one comes face to face with both unsavoury people and, well, challenging situations.  Bryan Cranston as Walter is brilliant.I am not prepared to provide any more information regarding the plot.  However, I do recommend that this programme be watched.  Over a period of about a month, I watched the whole series.  I was captivated.

1667009,A106YXO3EHVD3J,B00EEDNA4M,"DR SHOCK ""MR. KIA RETURNS! ;-b""","[1, 1]","I've finally finished watching the Breaking Bad Money Barrel box set on Blu Ray and I'm very impressed with it overall. The barrel is pretty cool and works well with the unique design of the individual season cases. They are made of a nice thick acrylic type plastic that are held together by magnets. Each season or half season in some cases are in their own case which hold each disc separately.The bonus items are a mixed bag, I like the challenge coin a lot, but the apron is pretty useless. I haven't taken it out of the package. This is for two reasons, 1) I don't really care if I see it and 2) I don't think I could ever get it back in the barrel top again after opening it. I would have rather had a zip lock bag of the blue ice stuff (fake of course!) as a memento from the show or maybe a replica set of the challenge coins that were produced for each season given to the folks evolved with this fantastic TV show. The apron is a bonus item so who am I to complain...it does fit in the top of the barrel so at least all the content can be stored in one place.The barrel is pretty well made and I was lucky enough to receive one in perfect condition, but the outer plastic case was cracked and although it wasn't a deal breaker I would have liked to have kept it intact. I don't think I could have salvaged it even if it weren't broken as it was pretty hard to open without damaging it. I think a box  with protective padding would have been a better option for the outer package.The individual seasons have the same menus, but I think all the episodes have been re-mastered as they all look and sound great! I owned the original BR releases and the new box set shows a major improvement especially on the earlier episodes. All original bonus material has been ported over and the exclusive bonus disc has plenty to grab your attention.OK, now we get to the TV series itself and I can say I've never been more impressed or engrossed in anything made for the small screen. It is without a doubt the best TV series I've ever watched and I can't remember any other series that didn't lose my interest at some point. I watched the series from the very first episide and I was hooked immediately. This show remains engrossing from start to finish. The level of acting, storyline, camera work and editing is just incredible and at theatrical film standards. I'm not comparing this show to sitcoms etc. but for a TV Drama series, this show has set a new benchmark that will probably never be surpassed. I've never been a huge TV series viewer, I'm more of a movie guy. My idea of great TV programs are mostly old sitcoms (The Honeymooners, The Dick Van Dyke Show, The Andy Griffith Show, The Munsters, Seinfeld etc.) I've never been much of a continuing TV series watcher because most of them drag on and on way too long. I loved the first few years of The Sopranos and Rescue Me, but they ran out of steam in the later years. I can't imagine anyone being bored watching Breaking Bad.The box set sold out very quickly and from what I've gathered there will not be any more of these sets released, but rest assured, this show will see future box set releases, maybe a bit more standard in form, but Sony isn't going to leave so many viewers without options to buy this excellent series. Be patient, there's a new box set coming around the corner... I'm sure of it.",5,THE CROWN JEWEL OF TV DRAMA SERIES!

1667012,A2W0GY64CJSV5D,B00EEDNA4M,FreeSpirit,"[41, 55]","QUICK UPDATE - 10/11/13 - Sony Pictures recently announced that this Blu-Ray and DVD set will include a 3-minute alternate ending, and also the making of this alternate ending. I won't write my guess here (don't want to spoil it for those who haven't watched the series yet), but for those who have watched the series, I'm sure you know what that ending is likely to be. I'm very curios to see how they play it out in the alternate ending!---I just finished binge-watching Breaking Bad and I have to say this show is perhaps the finest show I have ever seen. All credit goes to Vince Gilligan for his brilliant writing and narration, and the outstanding cast that has portrayed the characters so well.If you think about it, the show is fairly low key in terms of its canvas and sets (the other end of this spectrum would be the opulent Game of Thrones where HBO has spared no expense - I'm a big fan of that show as well). The strength of Breaking Bad is its simplistic sets, gripping and powerful pace and narration, and brilliant acting. These factors are what make the show an absolute delight to watch.NO SPOILERS really - The story is about a simple Albuquerque-based Chemistry professor, Walter White, who has perhaps had subdued resentment all his life as his colleagues have passed him by to more success and money than he was able to achieve. He was Mr. Nice Guy who avoided conflict, played by the book, loved his family, and was very much the guy next door. In part, he was satisfied with his simple life at home and at work, but subconsciously he always knew he was capable of much more and felt the world unfairly passed him by. Diagnosed with stage three lung cancer, he figures he has little to lose, and wants to make sure he provides for his family before his departure. This desperation triggers a whirlwind of events as he goes on to become a master chef of the best quality meth in the southwest, perhaps the entire country.The narration beautifully walks through the changing phases and personalities of Walt. From wanting to cook meth because he wants to leave enough money behind for his family, to eventually doing so because he was having fun doing it, Walt goes through various shades of transformation. Towards the darkest parts of season 6, you almost feel like the guy has completely lost it. Yet, strangely you will find yourself rooting for Walt, I guess partly because his nice family guy image stays with you throughout (I mean he leaves his house every morning to cook meth carrying a lunch bag with his name written on it!). The various battles in his mind, at his home, at work, are all very well acted out and directed.Kudos to Bryan Cranston for playing Walter White so brilliantly, he just owns this role. I cannot think of any other actor who could have portrayed Walt so well. Aaron Paul, playing Jesse - Walt's tormented partner in crime (for the most part), is pure Genius with a capital G. If you want to truly see his brilliant acting, check out two scenes in particular - one is I think in season 4, when he has a nervous breakdown in front of Walt after finding out he has to accompany Gus to Mexico, and the second is when he's basically having a one-sided conversation at dinner with Skyler and Walt. Again, pure Genius! My other favorite characters are Hank Schrader, played brilliantly by Dean Norris (he has a slight Jack Nicholson thing going...I think), and the sleazy but brilliant lawyer Saul Goodman played by Bob Odenkirk (they actually have a site bettercallsaul.com - check it out to see how sleazy he comes across). No amount of praise is high enough for the entire cast of this show.A few of my favorite quotes:""I am not in danger Skyler, I am the danger."" - Walter WhiteJesse - ""Got some big cow house that way..."". Walt - ""Cow House?"". Jesse - ""Yeah, where they live......the cows""""Just because you shot Jesse James, don't make you Jesse James"" - Mike Ehrmantraut""You are not the guy. You're not capable of being the guy. I had a guy, but now I don't. You are not the guy."" - Mike Ehrmantraut""Someone has to protect this family from the man who protects this family."" - Skyler White""You asked me if I was in the meth business or the money business. Neither. I'm in the empire business."" - Walter WhiteThe whole Star Trek teleporting discussion between Badger and Skinny Pete - I thought that was hilarious!There are a few other great ones but not appropriate to be written here...yup, the jewels from Jesse.If you just want to watch the show, you can watch it on Netflix or Amazon Instant Video for a fraction of the price of this Blu-Ray set. That being said, this set makes an awesome gift and is truly a collector's item with all the extras that it comes with - special features, letter from Vince Gilligan, replica barrel (no money in it I'm sure!), Los Pollos Hermanos apron, 2-hour documentary, etc.Overall this is one of the best shows I have watched and I very highly recommend it to all - and btw, don't forget bacon and eggs on your next birthday!",5,MIND......BLOWN!!!,1381190400,"10 8, 2013",2013,5021,"['QUICK', 'UPDATE', '10/11/13', 'Sony', 'Pictures', 'recently', 'announced', 'Blu-Ray', 'DVD', 'set', 'will', 'include',

1667019,A3OJPC8MOBI3X4,B00EEDNA4M,Jet Lagged,"[10, 21]","The Xmas present to top all Xmas presents.This collection contains all six seasons of the truly brilliant Breaking Bad series. Strictly speaking there are only five seasons. But the last Series 5 was broken up into Parts 1 and 2. For convenience here I shall refer to the last Season 5 (Part 2) as ""Season 6"".Slight unavoidable spoiler follows - if you have not seen ""Season 6"" please look away now!What a clever idea to have the entire collection of this truly outstanding series packaged in one of Walt's black barrels. As regular viewers will know, Walt stashed all his money in seven black barrels before burying them in the New Mexico desert.With ""Season 6"" Breaking Bad entered the Guinness Book of World Records for being the most critically acclaimed TV show ever. It received a whopping score of 99 out of 100 on a global critical scale. It overtook the previous holder of the record (""The Wire"") which had a score of 98 out of 100.The Guinness World Records entry does not refer to actual viewing figures. The way it works is that it looks at the review site Metacritic which produces an average that it draws from reviews from ""leading media publications"" worldwide.To give you an idea just how good these last episodes of this collection are consider the fact that the first four seasons only attracted aggregate critical rates of 74, 85, 89 and 96 respectively. ""Season 6"" comes in with a huge 99 rating.Breaking Bad, as the above figures indicate, really took off in Season 4 with the clash between Walt and Gus Fring.Gustavo Fring was one of the truly memorable characters in the series. His connection to the Chilean military were hinted at but were never developed. He and Walt were like two chessplayers in combat. Gus is rational and clear headed. He sees the demands of the position and makes his moves accordingly. He tries to minimise the friction by keeping his emotions out of the picture. He will be ruthless, but only when he needs to be. When the demands of the position call for it, blood will be spilt. But when the position calls for quieter measures he will do this too - such as waiting on customers in his restaurant business.Walt sees himself as cast in the same mould. But he is deluding himself. He is fully rational only in his own mind. His days of being a carwash cleaner are over for good and there is no going back. He has never felt more alive than when hatching his adrenaline fueled plans. In reality, he is in touch with his own inner psychopath. It's the game itself that now turns him on.By contrast, for Gus it's mainly about the appreciation of capital. And the sacrifices that must be made to get at it. There is something almost noble about him.Walt is more of a terrifying suicide bomber. When his back is to the wall, he becomes very, very dangerous. He cannot be controlled. The mistake Gus makes is to think he can control Walt. Nitroglycerin is useful for clearing obstacles, but not if there is a bumpy road ahead.Gustavo's initial judgment is the correct one. He once rejected Walt as being unsuitable for the business. He should have stuck to that decision. But then we would all have been deprived of the ensuing drama contained in Season 4.And Season 5 also explodes into another truly great season, or half a season. I was completely blown away. What series gets better and better like this one does? This season's episodes are more taut and concentrated. One of the most enjoyable I have ever watched. A heck of a lot goes on. There are some magnetic moments in more ways than one.All the cast are at the top of their game here. I would single out the memorable performance of Jonathan Banks, who plays Fring's former bagman, Mike. I think he deserves an Emmy for this one. The tension between Walt and Mike is one of the compelling features in some of these episodes.There is one scene where Mike has to dispose of an incriminating laptop. He hurls it down what looks like an old abandoned well. I remember thinking that the laptop could possibly be retrieved by the Feds. Not like Mike to be that unprofessional. It turns out that a few extra seconds were deleted from the scene. (One advantage of the DVD over Netflix is you get to see what gets left out). For the record, Mike chucks a hand grenade after the laptop. It fails to go off. Mike then says:- ""I'm gonna KILL that guy!"" In my opinion, that deleted scene should have been retained. Better in than out.The new character, Lydia, also shines. And Walt starts to throw his weight around. He is now where he wants to be. He promises Jesse that there will be no more deaths. Well that's good for a laugh anyway. You feel quite sorry for Jesse's predicament. Jesse and Saul now rightly live in fear of the creature that Walt has metamorphosed into. It ain't pretty. Any residual sympathy the viewer has for Walt has now all but evaporated.The viewer also feels sorry for Hank, visibly shattered when he realises he is dealing with the criminal behaviour of a Monster. His DEA unit has never confronted anyone like Heisenberg before, though Fring came close. They have been utterly unprepared to do battle with perhaps the most disciplined mind in New Mexico. He thinks back to an innocent job he once had and wishes he had enjoyed it more - back to a time when he didn't have to chase monsters. Then comes the twist at the end!Another (Slight) Spoiler Alert:- In one of the episodes of ""Season 6"" somebody places a tracking device on Walt's car. He can't control himself and confronts the person he thinks did it. Not a sharp move by Walt. Gus Fring did not make that mistake when he was under the spotlight. Fring cleverly allowed the device to remain. Once again, Walt's spleen gets in the way of his much vaunted rationality.These final episodes of ""Season 6"" are totally addictive. There is no let up in the tension. In fact it is increased. Walt has to constantly stay on his toes. You can see things start to unravel. Sit on the edge of your seat at what happens at the end of episode 5! Matters come to a head in a truly memorable episode 6, one of the most dramatic episodes in the entire series. There is a balance of power change. In the very last two episodes, 7 and 8, you begin to feel sorry for Walt all over again. The final episode, the conclusion of Walt's adventure, is just stunning and unforgettable.Utterly compulsive viewing. Vince Gilligan has really raised the bar with this one. I wish this series didn't have to end. But, like the George Harrison song, all things must pass. Here it all is now - wrapped up in a barrel.Amazon Update: 24th September 2013 - Breaking Bad has just won an Emmy for Outstanding Drama Series. It is well deserved.

1667020,A3GAQ8EHA5RNXZ,B00EEDNA4M,Joshua F. Wright,"[1, 6]","This was a series that I had no desire to watch.  I liked Bryan Cranston in Malcolm in the Middle and seeing another comedic actor trying to play in a dramatic role just seemed been done before.  After hearing all the rave reviews I decided to give it a try and I couldn't be more happy that I did.  This series touches a lot of emotions and allows us to justify each characters beliefs.  You can relate to Walter fighting cancer, Jesse dealing while thriving for a normal life, Hank's pursuit of the unsolvable case, their families getting sucked in, and sadly enough the reasoning of the drug lord's.  At several points throughout the show you would really hate a character and later on feel sadness for them.  Why was I hoping for Walter to get away with his scheme or Jesse to establish a smooth running drug business?  Then throw in this jack ass lawyer Sal that actually knows what he's doing, insane?  Not at all, this is what makes this series special.  A lot of series will play up to the viewer and give you those feel good moments.  Breaking Bad stuck to each persons role, and for example I use Walter's wife.  Walter and her never really had that &#34;kissy kissy&#34; scene.  Even in the end she would not give Walter that goodbye hug.  Maybe I am being way to picky but little things like that made the show feel so real.  I was exhausted after watching an episode but like Walter's meth, I couldn't get enough and clicked on the next episode.  This is a very special series that deals with many issues we sadly deal with.

1667023,A16F8IW5NK9Y4Q,B00EEDNA4M,Kristin Ames,"[9, 15]","Breaking Bad is the best show I've ever seen. It deserves 20 stars. I didn't even know what it was it was about when I started watching it, which made it even better. I'll skip the synopsis, since most reviews have that covered. I watched most of the episodes on Netflix, then watched the others on cable, because Netflix didn't have all of them (surprise, surprise).What's so great about the show? It has a little bit of all of us in it. It's about love, hate, fear, indifference, greed, and lust. It's about kids. It's about corruption. It's about the contradiction between our internal and external selves. It's about sacrifice. It's about craziness. It's about money. It's about change. It's about being human, most of all.The acting is superb. I have never seen anything so realistic. It doesn't seem like acting at all. There's a lot of dark humor underlying the tragedy as well. It reminds me a lot of the movie Fargo. My favorite actor in the show is the lawyer, Saul Goodman. He is the ultimate stereotypical shady lawyer, though his outward appearance suggests the exact opposite: from his name, to the tacky inflatable Statue of Liberty on his office building, to the Constitution mural in his office. He's as crooked as a three dollar bill, and hysterically funny. I look forward to his Breaking Bad spinoff show.Finally, I also loved the fact that the show didn't last forever. So many good shows have been ruined by wearing out their welcome on TV (CSI and American Idol come to mind). Every show has a limited life cycle, no matter how good they are. Going out with a bang is always the best strategy, IMO.",5,A clone of everyone's rave reviews but the show deserves it.,1380499200,"09 30, 2013",2013,1621,"['Breaking', 'Bad', 'best', 'show', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', '20', 'stars', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'was', 'when', 'started', 'watching', 'made', 'even', 'better', ""'ll"", 'skip', 'synopsis', 'most', 'reviews', 'have', 'covered', 'watched', 'most', 'episodes', 'Netflix', 'then', 'watched', 'others', 'cable', 'Netflix', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'surprise', 'surprise', 'so', 'great', 'show', 'little', 'bit', 'love', 'hate', 'fear', 'indifference', 'greed', 'lust', 'kids', 'corruption', 'contradiction', 'internal', 'external', 'selves', 'sacrifice', 'craziness', 'money', 'change', 'being', 'human', 'most', 'all.The', 'acting', 'superb', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'so', 'realistic', ""n't"", 'seem', 'acting', 'lot', 'dark', 'humor', 'underlying', 'tragedy', 'as', 'well', 'lot', 'movie', 'Fargo', 'favorite', 'actor', 'show', 'lawyer', 'Saul', 'Goodman', 'ultimate', 'stereotypical', 'shady', 'lawyer', 'outward', 'appearance', 'exact', 'opposite', 'name', 'tacky', 'inflatable', 'Statue', 'Liberty', 'office', 'building', 'Constitution', 'mural', 'office', 'as', 'crooked', 'three', 'dollar', 'bill', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'look', 'forward', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'spinoff', 'show.Finally', 'also', 'loved', 'fact', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'forever', 'So', 'many', 'good', 'shows', 'have', 'been', 'ruined', 'wearing', 'out', 'welcome', 'TV', 'CSI', 'American', 'Idol', 'come', 'mind', 'show', 'limited', 'life', 'cycle', 'matter', 'how', 'good', 'are', 'Going', 'out', 'bang', 'always', 'best', 'strategy', 'IMO']",N/A
1667024,A1OZAYRJQAERTK,B00EEDNA4M,Larry Benjamin,"[1, 1]","I came to this series late, after the final episode had already aired, and didn't know much about it other than ""a high school chemistry teacher finds out he has cancer, and starts cooking meth to provide for his family."" There's more to it than that, but not what people think. Much is made of Walter White's ""transition"" from a put-upon shmo who meekly tolerates the routine injustices of daily life, into a ruthless drug kingpin. It's true that many people revaluate how they are living their lives when they receive a terminal diagnosis; sometimes this takes the form of becoming more aware of what is around them, savoring every moment as precious, because there won't be many more of them. For White, his cancer freed him from the bonds of polite society.The problem is that he wasn't a genuinely decent person to begin with. He was always a gangster, but until he was given his death sentence, he was controlled by fear - fear of the police, fear of losing his job, fear of society's disapproval. It's no different than someone whose only motivation for decent behavior is ""because the Bible says."" White never overcame his bitterness over his own poor business decision to trade what turned out to be billions of dollars for the equivalent of a few months' mortgage payments. He wasn't being prudent or making a reasoned decision to avoid the potential risk of losing everything in ""Gray Matter"" by taking a small buyout; he was motivated primarily by fear, and could never forgive himself. Once he realized that he had nothing to lose, it was only a matter of time until his true personality came out, unhindered by the normal social controls.Of much greater interest and complexity was the Jesse Pinkman character, who despite his criminal behavior, is a basically decent person. In several episodes, he demonstrates his concern for children, not because society tells him that as an adult, he should treat them kindly, but because he genuinely cares about them. He struggles against his loyalty to Walter on one hand, and his periodic disgust at Walter's actions. In an amusing but highly realistic way, he refers to Walter as ""Mr. White."" I thought about what I would call one of my own teachers if I were to run into them - it would be strange to call them ""Dorothy"" or ""John"" or ""Harry;"" how much more familiar they are as ""Mrs. Schmidlap"" or ""Mr. Kunstler"" or ""Mr. O'Fallon."" Another appealing character was Mike Ehrmantraut, a brutal and violent man who nevertheless lived by a strict code. Walter, of course, has no code other than his own ego.The show is riddled with other fascinating characters - Huell, who may starve to death in a hotel room that he cannot leave; Lydia and her damn stevia, Hector Salamanca and his bell, the psychopathic Tuco (""I can't just leave my family!"" ""You can get another family""); the twins who are more cyborg than human, and ""Better call Saul!"" Goodman, who, for some inexplicable reason, is reportedly being considered for a ""prequel"" series of his own. Of all the characters, they pick him? Gustavo Fring, in my opinion, would have been a much better choice - there are hints of a secret past in Chile under the Pinochet regime that might have provided a background for his own transition from a normal person to a ruthless and self-serving killer.""Breaking Bad"" with its single story arc centered around a single character, has more in common with shows like ""Dexter"" than the complex, multi-thread dramas that have proliferated in recent years since ""The Sopranos"" and is currently epitomized by ""Game of Thrones,"" that has so many separate yet intertwining plots that you almost have to take notes. Compared to that, despite the endless plot twists and unexpected foreshadowing, ""Breaking Bad"" is basically a simple and linear presentation of a man's descent into self-serving depravity.

The price went up the next day, so I was fortunate. But now that I've received the set, it's pretty formidable.I'll never open the silly apron, and the coin is useless, so they'll stay in the top compartment never having been touched, but the disks themselves are pretty spectacularly packaged. They are contained between thick disks of plastic, held securely together with magnetic clasps. It's ingenious and elegant. The 2-plus-hour documentary is held under the top lid by a standard DVD-type clasp and it's an amazing chronicle of the final season. I can't praise it enough.After assessing the large and heavy barrel package, I'd have to say it's much larger than I expected, so it's definitely not a space saver, but it's well engineered and fun, and the show is amazing, of course. If I was a slightly wealthier person I'd have purchased this at full price with no problem. I was simply fortunate to catch it at the right time and get it for a mere twenty bucks a &#34;season.&#34;Silly novelties aside, this is a fantastic set contained within secure and memorable packaging. I recommend it if you're affluent enough to purchase it. If not, I understand and sympathize. It's a terrible dilemma for fans of the series.

So owning this is kind of an event for me, and I couldn't be more pleased.I preordered and received on release date, unfortunately, my set was not packaged well and was pretty much destroyed. I was frustrated, but Amazon processed my refund VERY quickly and I am still pleased with their customer service.Anyway, I went out and bought the set where I could examine it thoroughly first! lolIts a great set, tons of fun. There are plenty of reviews detailing the set and they are accurate. Its great.The only thing is.........I think the printings on the BR holders is a little weird. I would prefer to just have the picture on the top of the case....when am I ever going to take out the BRs to see the complete picture?! Plus, that's how its displayed on the back. You can clearly see the entire teddy bear and Walts face on the cases that have BRs in them...but that is not how it really is.

I wanted to post a review to say this is well worth the original Amazon pricing - which is what I paid for it and it was delivered the day this edition first came out - just before Thanksgiving 2013.  I don't know that I'd feel the same about paying the ridiculous amount(s) that people are now selling this for - because the truth is that the extras are fun and the apron and coin are kind of cool but it's really only the show that you need.  I rewatched the entire series this past week (yes, all 62 episodes again in less than a week) and the writing and acting truly are stunning.  Bryan Cranston is literally peerless as Walter White - he is simply amazing and the supporting performances from Aaron Paul, Anna Gunn, Dean Norris, Betsy Brandt, RJ Mitte, Jonathan Banks, Bob Odenkirk and Giancarlo Esposito are breathtaking.  This show will make you laugh - thanks especially to Bob Odenkirk's hilarious yet surprisingly vulnerable portrayal of sleazy attorney Saul (&#34;better call Saul&#34;) Goodman -- and it will make you cry (the final season's episode Ozymandias is the most heartbreaking hour of any drama I've ever seen - in TV or film) and will always leave you wanting more.  It concludes with what is in my opinion the finest finale of any show I've ever seen which makes the emotional investment ultimately worth every tear shed.  I highly recommend this show to everyone -- and this Blu-Ray edition to everyone as well - as long as you stay away from the price guagers.  Most important, don't let them stop you from ordering the entire DVD series of seasons 1-5 for far less because the fact is that no show ever needed lots of extras less than this one - the episodes themselves are the real treat.",5,Well worth the money!

1667035,A39W3263A9HCMN,B00EEDNA4M,"Renfield ""Up the Irons""","[3, 5]","As far as TV goes, I can't name a mainstream series that has captivated more than Breaking Bad (Doctor Who notwithstanding). And it isn't hard to see why it's so popular. For starters, look at the opening scene of the very first episode. It starts the whole series off on a bang and very tightly. With an evident drug deal gone wrong and a normal looking man, the last guy you'd suspect is a meth cook, and a kid who is very clearly a drug dealer and is passed out, driving in their R.V., fearful that the cops will catch them. Then the man, named Walter White, records a video ""suicide note"" and prepares for his inevitable execution by cops. Now THAT's how you guarantee the audience that they'll stay with the show to the end.By now, Breakng Bad needs no introduction. It started off as a small cult favourite with rather unsatisfactory ratings, before everyone rented the first season on home video and quickly got in line. I didn't join the Breaking Bad party until just after the show ended, but I managed to binge-watch the series on Netflix (downloading the last eight episodes as they arent commercially available on DVD yet) and throughout the whole month I spent watching it, was hooked and wanting to know what happens next.I guess what really makes the show so addicting is its characters. Even when the show is in satisfying, which is rarely ever, the show has its characters to fall back on. Beginning with Walt White and Jesse Pinkman. Their chemistry together makes them an unforgettable character duo. They go through the wars together and they love and hate each other so many times. You'd never imagine a high school chemistry teacher turning to cooking and selling meth with one of his former students in real life, and in a way you can sympathize with him. He has been diagnosed with cancer, he has a family to support and some good comes from this bad decision- funding his brother in law's treatments after taking down two drug dealing twins goes wrong, etc. Jesse is a character who starts off as a total klutz and an idiot, in a lovable way too. Some of the show's funniest moments (a dissolving body in a bathtub gone wrong, a simple payback in season two that becomes a home invasion unexpectedly) come from him. But starting with season three, you realize he really is a good character behind all the drug dealing. You can feel for him too, despite not being the most likable character. And then Walt's family, including his wife Skyler who may seem annoying at first but soon becomes a hero in and of herself, and his son Walt Jr., a disabled teenager who loves his dad and would hate to lose him (for the most part, of course), are just as interesting and sympathetic. Then there's the badass Hank and his naggy wife Marie, and the comic relief characters Badger and Skinny Pete. And has there been a better TV villain than Gustavo Fring? Considering he was just a filler character when the actor who played Tuco abruptly left, it's hard to tell that because he's such a good character and is both evil and scary, yet charming in a way.The performances only further the show's staying power. Bryan Cranston is not just that klutzy dad from Malcolm in the Middle anymore. In fact, with how well he plays Walt, it's hard to tell he played Hal before. Every trace of Bryan Cranston is gone and Walter ""Heisenberg"" White has taken over. He never goes over the top, he plays a normal human being, which is what makes Walt's rise to power even scarier. Jesse Pinkman is equally as amazing and he manages to play a drug dealing young man very believably, to the point where you feel as if you're watching a real person. Everyone else is equally as fantastic, especially Giancarlo Esposito, whose villainous performance as Fring puts Heath Ledger's portrayal of The Joker to shame. He doesn't go over the top as well, and his triumphant final scene manages to make one of the best villain exits ever.And not to mention just generally how consistent the series is. The show starts off slowly, but gets going in season three and keeps building up to the final episode in an explosive payoff, it makes the show far more poignant. In general this series is just really fantastic and one of the only shows that comes close to perfection. The hype is worth it.... you can trust me on this one. By all means a must-see television show!",5,"""I am the one who knocks!!!""",1382832000,"10 27, 2013",2013,4351,"['As', 'far', 'TV', 'ca', ""n't"", 'name', 'mainstream', 'series', 'captivated', 'more', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'notwithstanding', ""n't"", 'hard', 'see', 'why', 'so', 'popular', 'starters', 'look', 'opening', 'scene', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'whole', 'series', 'bang', 'very', 'tightly', 'evident', 'drug', 'deal', 'gone', 'wrong', 'normal', 'looking', 'man', 'last', 'guy', ""'d"", 'suspect', 'meth', 'cook', 'kid', 'who', 'very', 'clearly', 'drug', 'dealer', 'passed', 'out', 'driving', 'R.V.', 'fearful', 'cops', 'will', 'catch', 'Then', 'man', 'named', 'Walter', 'White', 'video', 'suicide', 'note', 'prepares', 'inevitable', 'execution', 'cops', 'Now', 'THAT', 'how', 'guarantee', 'audience', ""'ll"", 'stay', 'show', 'end.By', 'now', 'Breakng', 'Bad', 'introduction', 'started', 'off', 'small', 'cult', 'favourite', 'rather', 'unsatisfactory', 'ratings', 'everyone', 'rented', 'first', 'season', 'home', 'video', 'quickly', 'got', 'line', 'did', ""n't"", 'join', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'party', 'just', 'show', 'ended', 'managed', 'binge-watch', 'series', 'Netflix', 'downloading', 'last', 'eight', 'episodes', 'arent', 'commercially', 'available', 'DVD', 'yet', 'whole', 'month', 'spent', 'watching', 'was', 'hooked', 'wanting', 'know', 'what', 'next.I', 'guess', 'what', 'really', 'show', 'so', 'addicting', 'characters', 'Even', 'when', 'show', 'satisfying', 'rarely', 'ever', 'show', 'characters', 'fall', 'back', 'Beginning', 'Walt', 'White', 'Jesse', 'Pinkman', 'chemistry', 'together', 'unforgettable', 'character', 'duo', 'go', 'wars', 'together', 'love', 'hate', 'other', 'so', 'many', 'times', ""'d"", 'never', 'imagine', 'high', 'school', 'chemistry', 'teacher', 'turning', 'cooking', 'selling', 'meth', 'one', 'former', 'students', 'real', 'life', 'way', 'can', 'sympathize', 'been', 'diagnosed', 'cancer', 'family', 'support', 'good', 'bad', 'decision-', 'funding', 'brother', 'law', 'treatments', 'taking', 'down', 'two', 'drug', 'dealing', 'twins', 'wrong', 'etc', 'Jesse', 'character', 'who', 'off', 'total', 'klutz', 'idiot', 'lovable', 'way', 'too', 'show', 'funniest', 'moments', 'dissolving', 'body', 'bathtub', 'gone', 'wrong', 'simple', 'payback', 'season', 'two', 'home', 'invasion', 'unexpectedly', 'come', 'starting', 'season', 'three', 'realize', 'really', 'good', 'character', 'drug', 'dealing', 'can', 'feel', 'too', 'not', 'being', 'most', 'likable', 'character', 'then', 'Walt', 'family', 'including', 'wife', 'Skyler', 'who', 'may', 'seem', 'annoying', 'first', 'soon', 'hero', 'son', 'Walt', 'Jr.', 'disabled', 'teenager', 'who', 'dad', 'would', 'hate', 'lose', 'most', 'part', 'course', 'are', 'just', 'interesting', 'sympathetic', 'Then', 'badass', 'Hank', 'naggy', 'wife', 'Marie', 'comic', 'relief', 'characters', 'Badger', 'Skinny', 'Pete', 'there', 'been', 'better', 'TV', 'villain', 'Gustavo', 'Fring', 'Considering', 'was', 'just', 'filler', 'character', 'when', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Tuco', 'abruptly', 'left', 'hard', 'tell', 'such', 'good', 'character', 'evil', 'scary', 'yet', 'charming', 'way.The', 'only', 'further', 'show', 'staying', 'power', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', 'not', 'just', 'klutzy', 'dad', 'Malcolm', 'Middle', 'anymore', 'fact', 'how', 'well', 'Walt', 'hard', 'tell', 'played', 'Hal', 'trace', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', 'gone', 'Walter', 'Heisenberg', 'White', 'taken', 'over', 'never', 'top', 'normal', 'human', 'being', 'what', 'Walt', 'rise', 'power', 'even', 'scarier', 'Jesse', 'Pinkman', 'equally', 'amazing', 'play', 'drug', 'dealing', 'young', 'man', 'very', 'believably', 'point', 'where', 'feel', ""'re"", 'watching', 'real', 'person', 'Everyone', 'else', 'equally', 'fantastic', 'especially', 'Giancarlo', 'Esposito', 'villainous', 'performance', 'Fring', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'portrayal', 'Joker', 'shame', ""n't"", 'go', 'top', 'as', 'well', 'triumphant', 'final', 'scene', 'manages', 'make', 'one', 'best', 'villain', 'exits', 'ever.And', 'not', 'mention', 'just', 'generally', 'how', 'consistent', 'series', 'show', 'slowly', 'going', 'season', 'three', 'keeps', 'building', 'up', 'final', 'episode', 'explosive', 'payoff', 'show', 'far', 'more', 'poignant', 'general', 'series', 'just', 'really', 'fantastic', 'one', 'only', 'close', 'perfection', 'hype', 'can', 'trust', 'one', 'must-see', 'television', 'show']",N/A

And that could be for that day or for a lifetime."" This show- well actually to call it a show would be a great understatement, I should say this masterpiece, follows the story of Walter White, and how he breaks bad. Walt is a high school chemistry teacher, and first portrayed as kind of a loser. He's emasculated by his family, disrespected by his students, and bullied by his boss. Forced to work two jobs to take care of his pregnant wife and disabled son, Walt soon finds out that he has terminal lung cancer, with only a few months to live. In order to save money for his family to live off of after he's dead, Walt teams up with his former student, Jesse Pinkman, to cook crystal meth.What follows is a roller coaster ride to Hell. Watching Walt's transformation into his drug lord alter ego, Heisenberg, is one of the most masterfully executed character arcs in television history. Through a series of subtle, and sometimes not so subtle, shifts, we see this previously sympathetic character become something mosnterous. Vince Gilligan has etched his mark forever in entertainment history with this series. When most people want to show a character turn dark, they tend to rush things, and show drastic changes in a short amount of time, sometimes only a season or two. Not here. It's piece by piece, that Walter White tears off the mask of the harmless family man, to reveal the beast lurking behind a visage of meek compliance. Bryan Cranston brings this character to life in shocking, amazing, and breathtaking ways. He is the one who knocks.This isn't to say that Walt is the whole show. Aaron Paul plays Walt's protege, Jesse Pinkman, a juggalo without the makeup whose dialogue consists mostly of the words ""Yo,"" and ""Bitch."" Although while Jesse might start off as a bit of a clown, his character turns out to be so much more. Even though he's the one initially identified as a scumbag, Jesse without a doubt has one of the biggest hearts on the show. Between himself, Walt, and their many criminal associates, Jesse is often the only one portrayed as having a conscience.A constant and intriguing element of the show is also Walt's brother-in-law, DEA Agent Hank Schrader, portrayed by Dean Norris. Hank is a typical alpha male tough guy, sort of character, although he is also often brought in for comedic effect and is without a doubt a force of good. What makes the Hank element so truly marvelous though, is the fact that while he maintains a close friendship with Walt, he is constantly hunting his alter-ego, Heisenberg. Hank describes himself as Popeye Doyle, waving goodbye to Frog-One.Now I could sit here and go over every one of the amazing characters in Breaking Bad, from Walt's pain in the ass wife Skyler, to the ever so polite and refined drug kingpin, Gustavo Fring. But to do so would be to go beyond the scope of what this review is supposed to be. Breaking Bad is patient, it makes you wait for the payoff to come, and when it does come, it will blow your mind. For example, in some of the early episodes you see some tension between Walt and his old college friends over a company called Grey Matter, and it's not until season five that Walt explains the history there, in one of the most powerful scenes in the entire series. ""I'm in the empire business."" The show also makes good use of symbolism, such as the fly and the pink teddy bear (you'll just have to watch and see). Every time you watch through the series, you gain something new from it. For example (spoiler ahead) if you look at the titles to all the episodes in season 2 that have a 'flash forward' to the finale, the titles form the sentence ""737 down over ABQ.""As I'm writing this review, it's three episodes before the series finale. I will come back and edit this twice, first when the series is finished to give my final thoughts, and perhaps compose a more in depth review, and then again when the box set is actually released in November so I can give my thoughts on this product itself.UPDATE 9/9/2013:So they released some pictures of the box set. I have to say, it looks really cool. It's designed in the shape of one of the barrels that Walt buries his money in towards the end of the series. Although I suppose it could also be a chemical barrel or one of the ones that they use to dissolve dead bodies in if you use your imagination. It also comes with a commemorative coin designed by Vince Gilligan and (my personal favorite) a Los Pollos Hermanos apron.The special features include:- No Half Measures, a documentary detailing the filming of the final 8 episodes.- Bad memories, Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul talk about the final episodes and their feelings and thoughts on the show.- Scene Envy, the cat tells us which scenes they wish they could have been in.- Shocking Moments, the cast reveals the moments that shocked them the most.- From Walt to Heisenberg, A montage showing the transformation from Walter White to Heisenberg.- How Will It End? Prerecorded predictions from the cast on how the series is going to end.- Avenging Agent: Dean Norris as Hank Schrader.- Scene Stealer: Betsy Brandt as Marie Schrader.- A Criminal Attorney: Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman.- Jesse's Journey: Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman.- Skyler Breaks Bad: Anna Gunn on Season Four.- Growing Up in the White House: RJ Mitte on Walt Jr.- The Ultimate Chess Match, a look back at the battle between Walt and Gus.- Looking Back: A Season Four Retrospective, the best of season four.- Ted's Wipeout, Christopher Cousins explains how Ted's head injury was filmed.- The Truck Attack Storyboard Comparison, storyboards for the episode Bullet Points, and an in depth look at the attack on the Los Pollos Hermanos truck.- Walt and the Challenger Storyboard Comparison, a look at the filming of Walt doing donuts in Walt Jr's car.UPDATE 10/9/2013:Here's some big news folks. The studio just announced that this set will include a 3 minute alternate ending! I'm sure there will be lots of speculation on what this could be, so i won't get into my own theories here. Can't wait to see what it is though!Vince Gilligan also personally confirmed that we will get to see some scripted scenes that were left out of the final seasons, one of them from the final episode itself where Walt confronts one of his former students at a gas station who recognizes him on his way back to town!UPDATE 11/26/2013:BOX SET IS IN HAND! I absolutely love this thing. You can tell just by holding it that it's made from high quality materials. When you open it up, the Breaking Bad logo on the inside is actually the companion booklet, with a personalized letter from Vince Gilligan inside. Each season is in these magnetized sea through plastic cases that look like coasters, and when you take out all the discs and put them together, they make a picture from the show! (flying pants, pink teddy bear, etc). When you open the top, there's an extra disc inside the disc with some backwards numbers (from the POV shot of Walt looking at his GPS). On the disc is a bunch of extras, including the never before seen 2 hour fifteen minute documentary of the making of Breaking Bad. Underneath that is an insert that makes it look like the barrel is filled with money. Inside of the insert is a full sized Los Pollos Hermanos apron. Also inside is a Breaking Bad challenge coin.This is by far the best box set I have ever seen, and not just because it contains the best show ever made. If you love Breaking Bad then this is a must own.",5,"Once You Break Bad, There's No Going Back...

1667038,A27B9U0LQYVRFC,B00EEDNA4M,Shawn R. Cumby,"[0, 1]","Disclaimer: I did not order mine from Amazon, I was able to pick it up locally. But this review is about the box set nonetheless. Also, this is a review of the product listed here, not the actual show. If you want to read my opinion on the show, go to IMDb. Get your s*** together, Amazon.I didn't buy this when it went on sale, as I did not have the money, and I was uncertain about it, having been slightly burned on previous box sets (looking at you, Disney/Marvel). Cut to a couple weeks ago, I walked into a local music store and boom! There this was, on display. I looked at it and held it, and could tell by it's heft, that it was pretty decent. So I pulled some financial strings and then pulled the trigger on it.I do not regret my purchase at all. Not one bit. In fact, I have no complaints whatsoever. And now I actually feel bad for everyone who bought one of these and had problems, only to not be able to return it due to it being 'out of print'. By purchasing it locally, I had no issues with shipping and breakage. I actually waited until I was done watching the whole series to make sure I didn't have any disc manufacturing issues. Everything played fine, although the load times for the discs are long, which made me sweat a little. The picture and sound are great. The menus are a little weird. They have the whole season and extras listed on each disc, but then it tells you to ""insert disc 2"" if it's not actually on the one you have in. Whatever.The graphics on each disc and 'coaster'/disc try are pretty cool as well. The disc trays themselves are pretty solid. The actual barrel seems pretty tough, but I still wouldn't let it fall from any height. The overall quality of this thing by far exceeds any other box set I own. And I thought the James Bond collection was pretty dope! I have not opened the apron, and I probably will not, unless it's just to hang it up. The coin is also pretty solid, and looks good. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase.Now for some issues. Not complaints, but issues. One of my disc tray magnets did pop out. One. Out roughly 45. And that was because I wasn't paying attention and tried to pry the trays apart, instead of twisting them. (Hint: for all you dummies out there complaining about this, try taking them apart like an Oreo cookie.) Best case scenario, I drop a little glue in there and fix it.The trays themselves do not lay flat, as I think they are supposed to. Someone else on here posted a picture of the trays stacked, outside of this case, in case you want to put them on a shelf. The bottoms of my trays have a slight convex curve to them, therefore a couple of the seasons do not lay flat on top of the other ones. This is hardly an issue for me, as The only time they will be stacked like that is if I am watching the whole series again. And I can live with that. Do I wish they were flat? Sure. Am I going to take a star off or bitch about the quality because so? No.The hidden documentary disc (spoiler alert: it's inside the lid!), is a little difficult to remove, but I have fat fingers. Even holding the lid right side up, so the disc will fall once the button is pressed, works only 3 times out of five. I think I can live with that.Do I recommend this? Absolutely! If you can find one not absurdly overpriced, and you are a true fan of the show. Otherwise, stick to Netflix or torrents. Just make sure it is in good shape inside the packaging, as much as you can.",5,Best Box Set Ever!!!,1392076800,"02 11, 2014",2014,3453,"['Disclaimer', 'did', 'not', 'order', 'mine', 'Amazon', 'was', 'able', 'pick', 'up', 'locally', 'review', 'box', 'set', 'nonetheless', 'Also', 'review', 'product', 'listed', 'here', 'not', 'actual', 'show', 'want', 'read', 'opinion', 'show', 'go', 'IMDb', 'Get', 's***', 'together', 'Amazon.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'when', 'went', 'sale', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'money', 'was', 'uncertain', 'having', 'been', 'slightly', 'burned', 'previous', 'box', 'sets', 'looking', 'Disney/Marvel', 'Cut', 'couple', 'weeks', 'ago', 'walked', 'local', 'music', 'store', 'boom', 'was', 'display', 'looked', 'held', 'could', 'tell', 'heft', 'was', 'pretty', 'decent', 'So', 'pulled', 'financial', 'strings', 'then', 'pulled', 'trigger', 'it.I', 'do', 'not', 'regret', 'purchase', 'Not', 'one', 'bit', 'fact', 'have', 'complaints', 'whatsoever', 'now', 'actually', 'feel', 'bad', 'everyone', 'who', 'bought', 'one', 'had', 'problems', 'only', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'return', 'due', 'being', 'print', 'purchasing', 'locally', 'had', 'issues', 'shipping', 'breakage', 'actually', 'waited', 'was', 'done', 'watching', 'whole', 'series', 'make', 'sure', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'disc', 'manufacturing', 'issues', 'Everything', 'played', 'fine', 'load', 'times', 'discs', 'are', 'long', 'made', 'sweat', 'little', 'picture', 'sound', 'are', 'great', 'menus', 'are', 'little', 'weird', 'have', 'whole', 'season', 'extras', 'listed', 'disc', 'then', 'insert', 'disc', '2', 'not', 'actually', 'one', 'have', 'Whatever.The', 'graphics', 'disc', 'try', 'are', 'pretty', 'cool', 'as', 'well', 'disc', 'trays', 'are', 'pretty', 'solid', 'actual', 'barrel', 'pretty', 'tough', 'still', 'would', ""n't"", 'let', 'fall', 'height', 'overall', 'quality', 'thing', 'far', 'exceeds', 'other', 'box', 'set', 'own', 'thought', 'James', 'Bond', 'collection', 'was', 'pretty', 'dope', 'have', 'not', 'opened', 'apron', 'probably', 'will', 'not', 'just', 'hang', 'up', 'coin', 'also', 'pretty', 'solid', 'good', 'Overall', 'am', 'very', 'happy', 'purchase.Now', 'issues', 'Not', 'complaints', 'issues', 'One', 'disc', 'tray', 'magnets', 'did', 'pop', 'out', 'One', 'Out', 'roughly', '45', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'paying', 'attention', 'tried', 'pry', 'trays', 'apart', 'instead', 'twisting', 'Hint', 'there', 'complaining', 'try', 'taking', 'apart', 'Oreo', 'cookie', 'Best', 'case', 'scenario', 'drop', 'little', 'glue', 'fix', 'it.The', 'trays', 'do', 'not', 'lay', 'flat', 'think', 'are', 'supposed', 'Someone', 'else', 'here', 'posted', 'picture', 'trays', 'stacked', 'case', 'case', 'want', 'put', 'shelf', 'bottoms', 'trays', 'have', 'slight', 'convex', 'curve', 'therefore', 'couple', 'seasons', 'do', 'not', 'lay', 'flat', 'top', 'other', 'ones', 'hardly', 'issue', 'only', 'time', 'will', 'be', 'stacked', 'am', 'watching', 'whole', 'series', 'again', 'can', 'live', 'Do', 'wish', 'were', 'flat', 'Sure', 'Am', 'going', 'take', 'star', 'bitch', 'quality', 'so', 'No.The', 'hidden', 'documentary', 'disc', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'lid', 'little', 'difficult', 'remove', 'have', 'fat', 'fingers', 'Even', 'holding', 'lid', 'right', 'side', 'up', 'disc', 'will', 'fall', 'once', 'button', 'pressed', 'only', '3', 'times', 'five', 'think', 'can', 'live', 'that.Do', 'recommend', 'Absolutely', 'can', 'find', 'one', 'not', 'absurdly', 'overpriced', 'are', 'true', 'fan', 'show', 'Otherwise', 'stick', 'Netflix', 'torrents', 'Just', 'make', 'sure', 'good', 'shape', 'packaging', 'as', 'much', 'can']",N/A

But for some dumb reason I waited to see if I would get it as a christmas gift...  Nope.  Then it wasn't being sold anymore, so I thought I missed my window, and I didn't want to get an unknown copy from e-bay.Finally, the collectors edition set is back on Amazon.  But for MUCH more $$$.  I bit the bullet and got a copy this time.  It's one of my favorite shows of all time, definitely in the top 3.  And the set is killer.  Really well designed, well executed.  As a hard-core fan, I'm happy with what they put together for the collectors edition set.Of course, it's all on BR, and the video/audio quality is excellent.

Haven't watched it yet, but I'm greatly looking forward to all the new content.The &#34;barrel&#34; itself is really well made, not at all cheap or flimsy.  All the DVD season sets are in their own magnetic-closure clear plastic trays.  Very nicely done.Of course there's the apron and the &#34;challenge coin&#34;.  I was shocked that the coin was actually really thick and heavy, I was expecting it to be cardboard, or maybe just cheap plastic, but it's very substantial.
