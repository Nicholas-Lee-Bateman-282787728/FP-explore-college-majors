The story is centered around a bickery cast with a poorly written script.  The show has no real leadership on a ship called Destiny cast afloat in space.  The sex (hetro and homo) is totally out of place and unnecesseary in this production.  I would not recommend this show to anyone. IT's overpriced this 1.5 just as 1.0 was.

Everything has to be done in an hour right? I think not!After watching the previous Stargate series, I have learned to appreciate the fast paced ""bottle"" episodic style of Stargate. But after the producers went from 10 season with Stargate: SG-1, to a seemingly quick 5 seasons of Stargate: Atlantis(SGA), I think they clearly saw that they needed to make a bold new change or the next project won't get past a single season or even a pilot episode.It would appear that there are people who will never like Stargate: Universe! I think that's a crying shame and you're missing out bigtime! I like the fact that they take 2 or 3 episodes to resolve an issue. I adore the shooting style of the show. I love the level of detail of the sets and the characters' back stories. As was revealed in a commentary, one of the producers got a chance to visit the set of Battlestar Galactica where he found that the level of detail there was stepped up another level for shooting in HD. There is alot to love about this show and they dont give everything away in the first episode so you will need to be patient and enjoy the journey!By the way - I own every season and movie in the Stargate franchise.

1348242,A1EAFFJQ2NDHGC,B003KZ27M6,Eric J. Anderson,"[5, 7]","I don't want to criticize the show merely because it isn't like the other two Stargate series. If the Stargate franchise folks wanted to take it in a new direction, then it should be judged on its own merits, not on its similarity to what came before.With SG-U they decided to go for more serious, less camp. That's not a bad thing. There's a great deal more conflict between the ensemble cast members, too. Again, not a bad thing, necessarily. The premise of being stranded on a runaway starship -- or at least a ship the passengers do not control -- is something different. It has potential.I have found the series watchable, but barely enough to keep me tuning in. Frankly, there aren't many characters I find likable, let alone heroic. And most shows are too much like the Bickersons in space. Crew arguing with other crew members, plotting against other crew members, manipulating other crew members, sometimes even getting violent with other crew members. This is not a happy ship! The captain is often arbitrary, capricious. The stones are interesting -- where one's mind can reach across the galaxy and inhabit another body. But then they do icky things while in another person's body. This is not exactly a family show. Also, does the lesbian angle really need to be pushed? Does that add anything to the show? It seems forced.Really, the more I think about these characters, the less I like them. The geeky computer guy is hard to dislike. But I wish he wasn't such a doormat for the gal he's got a crush on.The plots of the episodes can be interesting, though the ship being threatened with destruction every other week gets a little monotonous. I wish a little more thought was put into the writing. The actors are mostly great, doing their best with difficult material.Would I watch this? Yes. Will I continue watching the second season? I'll give it a chance. Would I pay money to own it?

1348243,A26F0H4X95PSPN,B003KZ27M6,"Frosty Cold One ""earthpigsprotege""","[3, 5]","Although ""military sci-fi"" is my least favorite subgenre of space shows, i have loyally watched every episode of Stargate since 1997, buying seasons as they came out on disc. SGU breathes new life into a franchise that ran its logical course - any longer and it would have been like staying at a job beyond the point where you learn new things and find your job a worthwhile challenge. Atlantis was starting to get repetitive and i was basically only tuning in to experience the witty, whiny sarcasm of David Hewlett. If we were in Season 13 of SG-1, I doubt it would have anything new to give us. SGU not only displays some talent in acting, but also a few new ideas in plot that were not explored in Stargate shows previously.To those who say it is ""untrue"" to its predecessors, I have one just word: Evolution. As a sci-fi audience, I am surprised that more people don't embrace evolution. The fact that the military doesn't succeed in ruling the miniature society aboard Destiny with Martial Law is what makes the show work. Sure, the soldiers come in handy, but most civilians don't want to live under a military dictatorship, and that comes across nicely.While the camera work, grim atmosphere, and recipe laced with sex blatantly copies BSG, I will not hold it against the producers for trying BSG devices to make a new SG show work. Luckily they also copied BSG's inclusion of philosophical debates (whether spoken or inferred) and the grand social experiments that spring out of one of sci-fi's oldest scenarios: people being stuck in space with each other. You'll also notice that they are playing around with flashbacks; many shows do this, but i got a distinct impression early on that they were trying to mimic LOST. Sometimes it works, other times it's just distracting.SGU was struggling to find its footing in the first half of the season, and it suffered from some particularly boring plots, such as one horrible episode that was the equivalent of having a wasp stuck in your house and trying to chase it out a window. Yet my perseverance in watching has finally paid off in the 2nd half of the season. The story arc is finally developing nicely, including a new group of aliens who lack the cheese factor of SG-1's Goa'uld and so far have proven more mysterious than the Wraith (and thank the gods that there's no sign of the replicators yet - the equivalent of space kitch).One thing that annoys the hell out of me is random inclusion of songs in the eps that i guess are supposed to be part of the narration or something but bomb the mood instead of affirming it. I mean the emo or whatever type of crap music they use is not as much of a disaster as if they woulda spliced a rap song into the footage, but they really screwed up bigtime by including music with lyrics. Obviously someone on the production team wanted to be trendy and/or include their favorite artists: this indulgence should not have been permitted.Edit Feb.2013: As for complaints about the seasons being released in halves: I agree, this is bogus, in a sense. However, at this point I wish I had bought them when the show was still on the air; if more fans had done this, it may have been justification for the studio to continue production (or perhaps this is just wishful thinking on my part).Anyway, the plot possibilities are almost limitless, and I think SGU has potential to pull off some great story arcs and keep the generally smart tone of the show without the trappings of its predecessors. Let's hope they keep moving in the direction that the 2nd half of s01 turned towards.

In an attempt to create a bit more suspense and adventure, the producers created a couple of situations that required them to use a ""god in the machine"" approach to get out of.Example: Dr. Rush being marooned, then magically showing up on an alien ship that is attacking destiny.  Sure, he explains how it came to pass, but things like this should not happen.Example: Scott, Eli and Chloe's gate to gate race to find destiny.  They finally make it to Destiny thanks to a plot element that is so convenient as to be rediculous.Secondly, the character development of the main characters seems to stall.  To be honest, I can only take so much of Eli's pining for Chloe.  Get over it.  She is out of your league.  She prefers guys who can actually SEE their penises when they pee.  Hit Destiny's gym and try again in a couple seasons dude.  Lt. scott has become a dry hole.  there is nothing more to be sifted out of his character (ditto Col. Young), and how much do you want to bet that at some point they might do a priest abuse story line with him?  Dr. Rush's moment in the sun with the flashbacks of Daniel Jackson and his wife were great, but is was the same character just in a different time period.  It would have been nice to use that for character development instead of backstory.The cliffhanger with the Leutian Alliance finding another ""Icarus planet"" and dialing on to Destiny was another relatively crude plot twist used to create some continuity with to other series.  don't live in the shadows, SGU!  Step into the light and grow into the show we all know you can be!

But before that, it looks like I could have gotten the Bluray set here on Amazon for what I paid for the regular dvd set. Anyway, no big deal. One thing that might interested some people, when I picked up the dvd set I noticed that there was a pouch attached to the back of the DVD case. Wasn't anything mentioned on the cover, but I assumed that it was an extra DVD or something. Turned out to be something, inside the pouch was a folded up box that when put together becomes a slipcase for the two  seasons - turning them into the full season of SG:U. Which I thought was nice. Also, inside the DVD case there is a rebate check good for $10 off either a season of Stargate SG-1 or Stargate Atlantis. The rebate check does me little good as there was something stuck to it which resulted in a good part of the check being destroyed. But, seeing how I already have all the seasons so that wasn't a big deal for me. Have no clue if these two extras are just something that comes in sets available from Walmart, or if they are also in the sets sold elsewhere.There are three discs in this set,* Disc one episodes: Space, Divided, Faith* Disc two episodes: Human, Lost, Sabotage, Pain* Disc three episodes: Subversion, Incursion - Pt. 1 & Pt. 2Back of the DVD case lists the following special features:* Chatting with the cast featurettes* Designing a New Race: Space Aliens* Tanked!

I've kept an open mind about the conflict between the characters and while I don't want a Star Trek Next Gen. feel where everyone's perfect and get's along with everyone show, I'd appreciate it if they went ahead and had civilians bury the hatchet with the military (and vice-versa) and start focus on stories outside the ship a bit more.There's some very likable characters and there's some talented actors on the show and I think they could make this into a pretty solid show so I'll be tuning into season 2.

I really hate how they've started doing that but in any case, everything about season one part one continues here (I guess see my review for 1.0 for full details of my opinion on that). As there, Stargate Universe split the fan base right down the middle into people who loved Stargate so hated Universe because it was too much like Battlestar Galactica, and people who hated Universe because it was too much like Stargate SG-1 and Atlantis. Having said that, there were leftovers in the middle and we loved this show. The balance of Stargate tech and complete, complex realistic characters who interact like real people, screw up, try to do right, are self-serving or just misguided was catnip. And the spectacular performances were the best part. (The totally cool ship was nice too.) Yes, the premise sounds like Star Trek Voyager, but the show itself was nothing like that. Try part one and if you like it, you'll want to see the rest. If you don't like it, don't bother with this half. It's pretty consistent all the way through.One caveat: they're big on cliffhanger endings, especially over the season break so if you find yourself hooked on season one, try to have season two lined up before you watch the finale. PS Season 2 is not currently available on Blu-ray.As for the Blu-ray set itself, it does include all the very many extras the DVD sets have and a few more.

While I loved both SG1 & SGA, I have to admit that SGU has quickly become my favorite of all 3 Stargate series. The casting is perfect and the large ensemble cast works well together. This is a much more realistic and gritty series than its predecessors. Comparisons with the recent version of Battlestar Galactica are inevitable, but only because like BSG, the emphasis here is more on the drama of survival.Yes, the series started out slowly, but the 3-part AIR was a perfect way to bring us into a very different Stargate world. While the first 10 episodes established that world and the personalities/relationships of the people onboard Destiny, the 2nd half of the season became a much more intense drama where traitors and heroes were revealed (sometimes they were the same person). We also saw sides drawn and allegiances formed, with people taking surprising stands. Ongoing power struggles keep shifting, with most people caught in the middle, while others aligned with whatever side could further their ambitions. The last 3 episodes brought things to a major climax that leaves us wondering whether the confrontation can bring the crew together, or shatter their fragile relationship even further.SGU is rewarding viewing if you give it a chance.

More challenging circumstances.  I think the creators would have done themselves a favor if they'd left the name Stargate out of the title and used it as a small subtitle (i.e. Stargate IV - or whatever iteration this is). I'm a facebook denizen, and many of the early complaints were that the show is so little like the older Stargates.  The fans of those shows wanted more of the same, and were disappointed that this veers way off that track.  I began watching this show hoping for something totally different, and was amazed that it's what I got.  Not boring formulaic stories, interchangeable with the other shows, barring a few detail changes.  Much of what other reviewers don't like cause me to love this show.  I think it's realistic that the people on this mysterious ship would be isolated among themselves.  They weren't meant to be together on a voyage, scrabbling for their very lives. Their behavior is unpredictable and often not particularly admirable.  That's what I'd expect under those circumstances.  I find myself so involved in the story that I don't think of the cast as a group of actors, but the characters they portray.  That, to me, speaks well of the creative team's choice of people to play the diverse travelers on Destiny. As for offering another DVD of the partial season, I have mixed feelings.  If there's enough extra material to make it worthwhile, I might be tempted to buy it.  As for the show: I'm in for the duration.

D LaRue,"[4, 4]","The first half of season one was very dark and I thought that it was unrelentingly grim..but I hung in there and all of a sudden this show took off and by the first season cliffhanger I was a true fan.  The writers have gone in to a totally different direction. The show seems much more character-driven and it's fascinating to watch the development. What you have to remember about this particular Stargate is that this time around you have a very large civilian population involved (in addition to the military) and they are not trained or prepared for what they have to face in this particular series. It makes for some very interesting conflicts between the military and civilian population as both learn that give and take is absolutely imperative if they want to survive.I do have to concur with everyone else about splitting the season as two different units, though.
