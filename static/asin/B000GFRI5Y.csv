Not that Im a Limb Bizkit fan, its just that I wanted to see if it was possible to suck at anything worse than he does at music. And to my surprise, its not, he acts better than he makes music. As a matter of fact, this movie was a pleasant surprise. Although, it wasn't by any means a super awesome makes me jump up and recomemend it to the world movie, it was entertaining enough to recommend to people who like movies of this type. Its a little slow paced and boring, but there is enough creepiness and tension throughout to keep you watching. And with absolutly no gore at all, this movie will disapoint gorehounds. The movie had an interesting premise, but it was a tad bit predictable. and the very last segment felt kind of tacked on and had a ""lets have a twist at the end just for to sake of having a twist"" feel to it. The alternate ending is pretty much the same only a slight variation to it. those who watched movie but missed the alternate ending should be able to figure out the change pretty easily without having to watch it, so if your thinking of buying the movie just to catch the alt ending, its not worth it.To conclude my little rambling review, I would say this movie is average.

1003390,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000GFRI5Y,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[17, 18]","Fifty miles past the end of nowhere lies Rockwell Falls, a self-styled perfect town that takes its solidarity, tranquility, and - above all - its equilibrium seriously.  On the surface, it's a pleasant little town where everyone seems happy, crime is nonexistent, and you never have to look very far for your next piece of apple pie.  It's a weird thing, though; the town's population never seems to change.  It took a century for some genius at the Census Bureau to notice this oddity, but the bureaucracy finally decided to send someone out to investigate.  Rockwell Falls doesn't cotton to strangers all that well, but the local leaders have little choice but to let Steve Kady (Jeremy Sisto), in to do his official government business.  Everyone seems super-friendly to him, but it doesn't take him long to figure out that something is seriously wrong with this town.  We the viewers learn early on just how Rockwell Falls keeps its population completely static, but it takes Steve a while to figure things out on his own.Steve is stymied in his efforts to interview several members of the community; according to the mayor and local doctor, those citizens are currently suffering from ""the fever.""  This fever isn't all that rare, but old Doctor Greaver is almost always successful at curing his patients one way or another.  Steve eventually learns all about this fever, as well as the unique religious beliefs that form the basis of the town's peculiar way of life.  The more he learns, the clearer it becomes that he is expected to become a permanent resident of Rockwell Falls.  It's for his own good, really, as those who do attempt to escape the town are struck down by God himself.  Steve doesn't buy that argument for a minute.  He's determined to return to civilization as soon as possible, and he doesn't plan on leaving by himself, either.  There's an orphan girl being treated for the fever by the good doctor, and a young lady named Courtney (Charlotte Sullivan) who wants out as badly as he does.  I have to say I really liked the way this story played out, as the filmmakers chose not to play it safe - perhaps realizing that a formulaic ending would negate the effectiveness and atmosphere of the entire film.  I really got a kick out of the final scenes.  (The DVD includes an alternate ending, which I have not seen and cannot comment on.)Population 436 never manages to become truly suspenseful, and it's certainly not scary, but it is surprisingly effective nonetheless.  After the first twenty minutes or so, the pacing of the story is quite good, letting the true nature of this local society emerge gradually, and the acting of the entire cast (even Fred Durst) is another feather in the film's cap.  As good as the film's basic concept is, this kind of story could easily have degenerated into something really silly, but director Michelle Maxwell MacLaren never allowed that to happen.  I'm not saying that everyone out there would enjoy this film, particularly action-oriented horror fans, but I think a lot of individuals will be pleasantly surprised by it - and that includes young teenagers.  For the life of me, I can't figure out why this film has an R rating - there are very few violent scenes (and none of them are the least bit gory), the language is quite pedestrian in nature (all of this takes place in a really gung-ho - albeit cult-based - religious community), and the film's one and only sex scene is tamer than many a scene you'll find on network television.",4,Numbers rule the universe -- especially if you live in Rockwell Falls,1163635200,"11 16, 2006",2006,3506,"['Fifty', 'miles', 'end', 'nowhere', 'lies', 'Rockwell', 'Falls', 'self-styled', 'perfect', 'town', 'solidarity', 'tranquility', 'equilibrium', 'seriously', 'surface', 'pleasant', 'little', 'town', 'where', 'everyone', 'happy', 'crime', 'nonexistent', 'never', 'have', 'look', 'very', 'far', 'next', 'piece', 'apple', 'pie', 'weird', 'thing', 'though', 'town', 'population', 'never', 'change', 'took', 'century', 'genius', 'Census', 'Bureau', 'notice', 'oddity', 'bureaucracy', 'finally', 'decided', 'send', 'someone', 'investigate', 'Rockwell', 'Falls', ""n't"", 'cotton', 'strangers', 'well', 'local', 'leaders', 'have', 'little', 'choice', 'let', 'Steve', 'Kady', 'Jeremy', 'Sisto', 'do', 'official', 'government', 'business', 'Everyone', 'super-friendly', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'figure', 'out', 'something', 'seriously', 'wrong', 'town', 'viewers', 'learn', 'early', 'just', 'how', 'Rockwell', 'Falls', 'population', 'completely', 'static', 'Steve', 'while', 'figure', 'things', 'out', 'own.Steve', 'stymied', 'efforts', 'interview', 'several', 'members', 'community', 'according', 'mayor', 'local', 'doctor', 'citizens', 'are', 'currently', 'suffering', 'fever', 'fever', ""n't"", 'rare', 'old', 'Doctor', 'Greaver', 'almost', 'always', 'successful', 'curing', 'patients', 'one', 'way', 'Steve', 'eventually', 'fever', 'as', 'well', 'unique', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'form', 'basis', 'town', 'peculiar', 'way', 'life', 'more', 'clearer', 'expected', 'become', 'permanent', 'resident', 'Rockwell', 'Falls', 'own', 'good', 'really', 'who', 'do', 'attempt', 'escape', 'town', 'are', 'struck', 'down', 'God', 'Steve', ""n't"", 'buy', 'argument', 'minute', 'determined', 'return', 'civilization', 'as', 'soon', 'possible', ""n't"", 'plan', 'leaving', 'either', 'orphan', 'girl', 'being', 'treated', 'fever', 'good', 'doctor', 'young', 'lady', 'named', 'Courtney', 'Charlotte', 'Sullivan', 'who', 'out', 'as', 'badly', 'have', 'say', 'really', 'liked', 'way', 'story', 'played', 'out', 'filmmakers', 'chose', 'not', 'play', 'safe', 'perhaps', 'realizing', 'formulaic', 'ending', 'would', 'negate', 'effectiveness', 'atmosphere', 'entire', 'film', 'really', 'got', 'kick', 'final', 'scenes', 'DVD', 'alternate', 'ending', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'can', 'not', 'comment', 'Population', '436', 'never', 'become', 'truly', 'suspenseful', 'certainly', 'not', 'scary', 'surprisingly', 'effective', 'nonetheless', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'so', 'pacing', 'story', 'quite', 'good', 'letting', 'true', 'nature', 'local', 'society', 'emerge', 'gradually', 'acting', 'entire', 'cast', 'even', 'Fred', 'Durst', 'feather', 'film', 'cap', 'As', 'good', 'film', 'basic', 'concept', 'kind', 'story', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'degenerated', 'something', 'really', 'silly', 'director', 'Michelle', 'Maxwell', 'MacLaren', 'never', 'allowed', 'happen', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'everyone', 'there', 'would', 'enjoy', 'film', 'particularly', 'action-oriented', 'horror', 'fans', 'think', 'lot', 'individuals', 'will', 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'young', 'teenagers', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'film', 'R', 'rating', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'violent', 'scenes', 'none', 'are', 'least', 'bit', 'gory', 'language', 'quite', 'pedestrian', 'nature', 'place', 'really', 'gung-ho', 'cult-based', 'religious', 'community', 'film', 'one', 'only', 'sex', 'scene', 'tamer', 'many', 'scene', ""'ll"", 'find', 'network', 'television']",Population 436

Being a little slow, it is only now that the bureau decides to send someone out to check on the strange figures.  Enter our friendly census agent who gets a flat tire as soon as he crosses the town line.  The town gets few visitors so there are no hotels or boarding houses but a place is found.  The residents are friendly enough but act a little strange not least of which is that they seem to expect him to start a new life there.  But then he discovers that the figure of 436 is not an anomaly.Now that the 436 figure is understood there is still the matter of getting out of town successfully.  Not doing so could have dire consequences.  But attempts to leave are always headed off and more dark secrets about the town are learned.  It becomes more and more imperative to leave the town.  But the big question is is there some other force other than the townsfolk involved?  The answers may surprise you.This is quite a good film.  It quickly manages to give both the feeling of a tranquil small town as well as a feeling of impending doom (not easy to do).  The ending is almost breathtaking.  The revelations build nicely as this is a town of many disturbing secrets.

Rochester Falls is a very tidy place populated by friendly and nice people - but very soon Kady also finds that this isolated little community has also a very dark secret. Later he finds that this secret is VERY dark indeed...This little nicely done film is sometimes referred to as a horror movie, but I prefer to consider it a thriller, as the atmosphere of fear is obtained with psychological tricks in the scenario rather than any kind of monster... As one of the previous reviewers already noticed, there is something from ""The wicker man"" in this film (the original one, not the pathetic remake) and I also found some elements from ""Stepford wives"", M. Night Shyamalans ""Village"" and ""Rosemary's baby"".The general mood reminded me also a little bit of Stephen King's short stories about little towns harboring a deep secret, like Children of the corn"" or ""Rainy season"" - but once again, it is neither a slasher flick nor a horror film with monsters (and no, there is no satanists in it either). Last but not least, in this film it appears that the Big Brother not only watches you but kind of REALLY loves you - in its own very peculiar way... There is only the slightest suspicion of something supernatural in this film, but it is enough to create a quite upsetting atmosphere.Actors, with the exception of Jeremy Sisto, were mostly unknown to me but they played very well and that includes the youngest of them, Reva Timbers, who plays Amanda, a schizophrenic little girl. The scenario is quite solid and I didn't see any obvious plot holes. The ending is very good (and definitely MUCH better than the alternative one, which you can watch in bonus features) and it gives this film both a nice closure and a sadistic twist...Bottom line, I liked this film. It is not a great masterpiece, but a solid, honest thriller which we can also interpret as something more than just a thriller...

I doubt very many people will be scared (or creeped out, or disturbed, or unsettled) by this film.  However, it is a moderately intriguing flick, in its own right.The film concerns a census worker sent to Rockwell Falls (one of those apple pie towns that seems to be frozen in the mid-30s) in order to verify their data.  While there, the worker (played ably, if not numbly, by Jeremy Sisto) discovers that the town's population of 436 has remained unchanged for a long, long time.  What follows is a twist on Shirley Jackson's The Lottery.Jackson's very disturbing short story has made it to the screen several times, but never very effectively, since the tale's punch lies solely in its unexpected reveal; no cinematic (or televised) reveal of that same story's twist is bound to be nearly as interesting as it is on paper.  Population 436 manages to avoid that snag by tossing in a few additional elements that give the movie enough juice to keep it from being a yawner.  The juice, however, is a bit stale.Some reviewers have compared this movie to The Wicker Man, which baffles me.  There are a few minor similarities (the same kind of similarities you'd find between, say, Star Trek and Star Wars) that aren't worth pointing out.  The Wicker Man, it is safe to say, is an aggressively, ridiculously, and almost insultingly bad film.  Population 436, while it certainly won't appeal to everyone, does its job with much less that could be called offensive or off-putting.  Even if you're the type who wouldn't like this film, you probably wouldn't hate it, either.I enjoyed my viewing of Population 436, to be honest, because it was a sort of clean sweep, it provided me with a nice distraction, and it wasn't in any way deficient.  It's a work-horse of a movie, much like the reliable but only mildly skilled office worker who isn't in danger of being fired or given a raise anytime soon.

Actually the film felt like it was slightly above one of those made for TV. Sci-Fi channel films. It's just slightly better than those.

What made me knock off 2 starts for this film is the same reason I knock off stars for other films. The characters make stupid decisions that just ruin the story. I just don't get that the main character feels the need to stop at everyone's house while he is trying to escape. I don't get why he feels the need to inform the towns people that he knows something is going on. For a guy alone in the middle of a place he's not familiar with he certainly has learned to ask all the wrong questions. I guess his Bureau training didn't cover how to keep your mouth shut.There are just times when your watching and you ask yourself why is he doing all this? Why doesn't he just count the peoples heads accept that there are 436 people in the town,eat some apple pie, get back in his car,drive home to Chicago,THEN tell the people at the office that this town is flippin crazy and call for an investigation. Heck he could make a youtube video about them warning the world it's not like they'd even know.It's just decisions like that in the movie that make you not find the characters believable.

Then, in a scene reminiscent ofmany past horror flicks, a man (Jeremy Sisto, the youth in ""GrandCanyon"") stops at a gas station to ask for directions (to RockwoodFalls). Everyone either turns away or becomes unfriendly for somemysterious reason.  It turns out he is a census-taker, and hasbeen assigned to go there.  When he finally arrives, he discoversa strange scene.  Everything is like it was in the early 20thcentury and the population has remained at 436 for over 100 years.This sets up some obvious problems, like what happens when ababy is born?  Or if someone just dies?  The people seem veryhappy on the surface, but you know something troubling or evillurks below the surface.  The basis is called Biblical Numerology,and the people are convinced that staying at 436 is in accordwith God's wishes.  The film develops slowly and the suspensebuilds quietly.  Once someone stays on, can they leave?  Thefilm offers two endings, barely different, but with hugeconsequences for the plot.  Both are provocative.  I reallyenjoyed this low budget but beautifully photographed film.  Itis more atmospheric than action oriented, be warned, but itreminded me of films like ""The Stepford Wives"", ""The Wicker Man"",(1974)and the John Ritter TV movie ""The Colony"".  The recurring themeis that once you get in, you may not be able to get out.  Very much worth a look.

Some say they are impressed with the film's main idea, which I also liked. Another thing I can say about the film is that for all tis great idea its story might have worked better within the format of TV programs. ""Population 436"" is longer than it should be almost by 30 minutes, showing its hands too early in its storytelling, in fact, in its opening.A census-taker Steve Kady (Jeremy Sisto) sent from Chicago is stranded in an isolated town of Rockwell Falls. He meets a young girl who is eager to listen to the world outside. He has a nightmare every night. He feels there's something strange going on in Rockwell Falls, where townspeople are all looking at him smilingly. All these things are familiar, but familiarity itself is not a big problem. But its poor storytelling is.The film is directed by Michelle Maxwell MacLaren, whose previous works are mainly for TV, as producer. In spite of the film's decent photography and effective acting from the cast including Jeremy Sisto, almost everything is told in a wrong order. As I am not allowed to discuss the film's story in detail, I cannot reveal the premise of the film, of which implausibility is less damaging to the film compared with the slow-moving way it is revealed in the flat narrative.

Any viewer who has already seen either version of the Wicker Man can officially pass on this movie, as they've already seen it.  Population 436 follows the Wicker Man's plot almost scene for scene, with only slight changes to names and places.  A guy shows up in the secluded villiage where no outsiders ever go.  People are strange and generally produce a creepy vibe.  It becomes apparent the townsfolk follow some sort of whacked out religion.  A little girl is in danger.  Hero guy sees creepy children being indoctrinated into relgious rituals in the school house.  Everything is leading up to a big festival where it's obvious to everyone something very bad is going to happen.  The ending is even an exact carbon copy of the ending of the remake of the Wicker Man.The acting and characterization aren't much better in Population 436 than in the film it emulates.  The hero is played by Jeremy Sisto, who does an amiable job playing the character he's been given, but the problem is that his character is annoying.  He's calm when he should flip out, and he flips out when he should be calm.  By the end of the movie the audience will literally be shouting at the screen, ""Just shoot someone already!  Run them over!  It's well within your rights at this point!""  The other actors really aren't worth even mentioning.  None of them give any oscar winning, let alone even noteworthy, performances.  Oh yes, and then there's the horrible CGI created fire scene.  Movie directors please take note : if you don't have the budget for superb, completely convincing CGI effects, please don't use CGI at all!  It just ruins any sense of immersion the viewer may have been experiencing previously.  The entire movie has a very ""made for TV"" feel to it, which makes sense, as this is director Michelle MacLaren's first foray out of television and into full length movies.
