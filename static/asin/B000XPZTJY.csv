1114754,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,B000XPZTJY,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[4, 9]","""The Phoenix Lights: We Are Not Alone"" is a cheesy little documentary about the amber lights seen over Arizona in March 1997. At the time, I was a fan ofThe X-Files: The Complete First Season, and had a sardonic professor who thought it was cool that the governor of Arizona (as well as Senator John McCain) humiliated the woman who believed these flying saucers were for real. Dr. Lynne Kitei provides some insights, there are eyewitness testimonies from professional pilots, people who aren't the UFO/Heaven's Gate types.""Phoenix Lights"" has the strength of the eyewitness testimonies, along with Dr. Kitei's attempts to find out what was going on. These people aren't the wild-eyed UFO types, but unfortunately Dr. Kitei comes across that way. There are children spliced in lisping about contact with extraterrestrials. It's unnecessarily sappy. What makes matters worse is that this is supposed to be used in schools(???) Boring documentaries are part of the academic experience-but this one?""Phoenix Lights"", sadly, ends up being unenlightening.",2,Aliens in Arizona,1292803200,"12 20, 2010",2010,1050,"['Phoenix', 'Lights', 'Are', 'Not', 'Alone', 'cheesy', 'little', 'documentary', 'amber', 'lights', 'seen', 'Arizona', 'March', '1997', 'time', 'was', 'fan', 'ofThe', 'X-Files', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'had', 'sardonic', 'professor', 'who', 'thought', 'was', 'cool', 'governor', 'Arizona', 'as', 'well', 'Senator', 'John', 'McCain', 'humiliated', 'woman', 'who', 'believed', 'flying', 'saucers', 'were', 'real', 'Dr.', 'Lynne', 'Kitei', 'insights', 'are', 'eyewitness', 'testimonies', 'professional', 'pilots', 'people', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'UFO/Heaven', 'Gate', 'types', 'Phoenix', 'Lights', 'strength', 'eyewitness', 'testimonies', 'Dr.', 'Kitei', 'attempts', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'wild-eyed', 'UFO', 'types', 'unfortunately', 'Dr.', 'Kitei', 'way', 'are', 'children', 'spliced', 'lisping', 'contact', 'extraterrestrials', 'unnecessarily', 'sappy', 'What', 'matters', 'worse', 'supposed', 'be', 'used', 'schools', 'Boring', 'documentaries', 'are', 'part', 'academic', 'experience-but', 'one', 'Phoenix', 'Lights', 'sadly', 'up', 'being', 'unenlightening']",N/A

Interesting, too, that it occurred within a few months of the 50th anniversary of Roswell. And, I'm not convinced that Roswell wasn't of earthly origin - I can't say the same for the Phoenix lights.
