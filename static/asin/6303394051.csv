Nearing his death, John Candy's movies have felt lackluster to watch, and Only the Imagination is one of them. It just doesn't work. Ally Sheedy isn't a likeable actress who saw her career to fizzle after St. Elmo's Fire. I find her character too one-dimensional and can't see her being with the cop. But really, it is Maureen O'Hara who kills the mood of the film. It's impossible for me to stand her, making time to move molasses and forcing me to hope that the movie will end as painlessly as possible. Anthony Quinn used to take on serious roles in his heyday, but in the 90's, he was typecast as the good looking hopeless romantic. What gives? And if I were him, I would stay very, very far away from the mother. Better women out there. Finally, John Candy...I like him, he does what he can do, and he has a one funny moment where the mortician did everybody. But, the film is a waste of time to sit through. It's just too many stereotypes and too much racism for me to take. All in all, remember that the cop had a large overreaction? Well, I wish any of them happened, and that will be a good riddance of the mother. I am dropping my rating of '3' to '2'.",1,Horrible.,1355788800,"12 18, 2012",2012,1243,"['Viewed', '5/04', '12/12Rate', '212/12', 'Only', 'Lonely', 'mean', 'Only', 'Imagination', 'Nearing', 'death', 'John', 'Candy', 'movies', 'have', 'felt', 'lackluster', 'watch', 'Only', 'Imagination', 'one', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'Ally', 'Sheedy', ""n't"", 'likeable', 'actress', 'who', 'saw', 'career', 'fizzle', 'St.', 'Elmo', 'Fire', 'find', 'character', 'too', 'one-dimensional', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'being', 'cop', 'really', 'Maureen', ""O'Hara"", 'who', 'mood', 'film', 'impossible', 'stand', 'making', 'time', 'move', 'molasses', 'forcing', 'hope', 'movie', 'will', 'end', 'as', 'painlessly', 'possible', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'used', 'take', 'serious', 'roles', 'heyday', '90', 'was', 'typecast', 'good', 'looking', 'hopeless', 'romantic', 'What', 'were', 'would', 'stay', 'very', 'very', 'far', 'away', 'mother', 'Better', 'women', 'out', 'there', 'Finally', 'John', 'Candy', 'like', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'one', 'funny', 'moment', 'where', 'mortician', 'did', 'everybody', 'film', 'waste', 'time', 'sit', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'stereotypes', 'too', 'much', 'racism', 'take', 'remember', 'cop', 'had', 'large', 'overreaction', 'Well', 'wish', 'happened', 'will', 'be', 'good', 'riddance', 'mother', 'am', 'dropping', 'rating', '3', '2']",Only the Lonely VHS

There were certain facts and circumstances here that challenge our ability to suspend our disbelief such as Candy, a Chicago policeman, being ""transferred"" to a job in Florida and also his tremendous obesity at that point in his life made the attraction between he and Sheedy a bit suspect. But John Candy was a tremendous joy in practically everything he ever did. His acting was always good and he portrayed the mother-dominated Danny Muldoon with aplomb. In fact, the acting overall, with Maureen O'Hara excelling in her role and Anthony Quinn adding a certain something to the endeavor, was another reason for why the film succeeds.

There is no debating that Candy was up to the light-hearted comedy demanded of him in his role as affable Chicago cop Danny Muldoon.  Candy was also more than capable of delivering on the dramatic elements in this story of a 38 year-old man finding love for the first time.  Credit that to the capable direction of Chris Columbus and his knowing script.  Candy also gets to play with some first class pros and I think that upped his game.  Maureen O'Hara lost none of her star appeal in her golden years as Danny's demanding mother.  This role could have been played as a stereotype but O'Hara injects complexity and, yes, sympathy for her character.  Ally Sheedy may also have had the best role of her career as Theresa, the introverted funeral home cosmetologist who is the object of Danny's affection.  Anthony Quinn also delivers an amusing turn as Danny's neighbor who burns the torch for his mother.

A plot that is identifiable to almost any moviegoer, (everybody knows somebody in this situation.)A cast consisting of a fine comic lead, good supporting characters and two Hollywood legends.  And a script that fits each actor like a glove.John Candy pleases in this low key role of a lonely police officer tied too tight to his mother (O'Hara) who has very strong opinons about almost everything and who plays the mother guilt card like no other as he is pursuing his interest in an equally lonely lady (Sheedy).  I watched this with my own mother who is O'Hara's age and saw her nodding in agreement all over the film. (until her full blooded Siclian fists clenched when O'Hara's character described us.  The look on her face was worth the price of the movie alone.)The story is plesant and worth your money, Candy &amp; O'Hara work well together (who would have thought she would outlive him!)  but the real power of the film is her interaction with Anthony Quinn.  Classic film buffs like myself will get a real charge out of Quinn once again persuing O'Hara, but this time without an Errol Flynn as a rival.  That sub plot is at least as interesting as the main one and for my money is better.  It is classic Maureen O'Hara, the strong woman who is chased by the strong man and frankly is a great contrast to the the exact opposite situation between Candy &amp; Sheedy.In the end to nobodys surprise love conquers all and Candy's final immagined scene (contrasting with several ones eariler in the film) gives him closure.  That final scene is my favorite and show O'Hara playing a character she has always excelled at.  Considering the events of 9/11/01 the ending has even more meaning as we see a member of &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot; setting an example (albert a fictious one) that would be bravely followed in reality 10 years later.I've said little about the good performances by Sheedy and Belushi, not to mention several other supporting characters in minor roles, they all add to the picture, but the stars make this film.

Ruether,"[2, 2]","After all this time I'm glad to finally have this wonderful movie on DVD; it was certainly worth the long wait!John Candy turns in a wonderful performance as Chicago police officer Danny Muldoon, in his late-30s and still living with his mother. He tries to pursue a relationship with a young girl working as a makeup artist in a funeral home, but his feisty Irish mother won't seem to let go. Quite a charming story, with a few jolts coming from Danny's imagined fears of his mother being harmed when he's not there for her. The way Chicago is represented is hit-or-miss, possibly due to licensing issues for some of the more well-known Chicago images (most notably, the Chicago policeman's uniform and the design of the Chicago squad car), but those flaws notwithstanding the movie still has a Chicago feel to it. There actually are still a few remaining store-front funeral homes in Chicago, and of course the plentiful Irish pubs are captured perfectly. Probably the unheralded star of the movie is old Comiskey Park, which for 80 years was the home of the Chicago White Sox. The filming took place after the final baseball game was played there in 1990 (and a few months before its fateful date with the wrecking ball), and the first-date picnic on the playing field was a wonderful and touching sendoff for the old park.

This is not an exception to that rule.

She is controlling and a bit selfish in that she doesn't see her sons need to have his own life.Each time John Candy tries to let go he has thoughts that something terrible will happen to his mother. His mother comes across as a completely controlling and insensitive person who we soon learn to dislike. We of course feel completely sorry for her son and hope he finds someone and runs away with her.As a police officer who knows everyone, he finally takes advantage of his position in very creative ways and meets the woman of his dreams. But can he keep her? Will his mother let him go?All I want to say is...watch this and enjoy it.

When he meets Theresa Luna (played by Ally Sheedy), who applies cosmetics to the newly departed at the family's funeral home, viewers get to watch this relationship develop.  However, when Danny's mother, Rose (played by Maureen O'Hara), finds out that Theresa is both Polish AND Italian, sparks fly.This is not a slapstick comedy film, as you might expect with John Candy.  It's a more serious film about loneliness, guilt, stereotypes, racism, and love.  A side vignette is the romantic pursuit of Rose by her Greek neighbor, Nick Acropolis (played well by Anthony Quinn).It's a film in the general style of boy meets girl, they fall in love after a number of stumbles, something happens and they break up, one or the other rethinks their life and goals, and they get back together.  Is this just the human condition, or what we find entertaining?One thing I didn't like about the movie was that Theresa Luna (Ally Sheedy), so cute and vulnerable at the beginning of the film, got much less loveable as the movie progressed.A repeated line throughout the movie was ""Sometimes it's good to be a cop.""

The movie is funny despite some ethnic slurs and O'Hara steals the movie. Upon her return to Tinseltown after the death of her husband, she was asked to play Rose Muldoon. She took one look at Candy and said ""OK, I'll play his mother"".Another icon Anthony Quinn plays the lovelorn neighbor. His scenes with O'Hara are classic. Two tremendous pros giving lessons in acting and their  chemistry is perfect.Candy and Ally Sheedy are newcomers compared to O'Hara and Quinn and this  humorous and entertaining movie gives them the chance to work with two of  filmdom's greats and both are wonderful in their roles.But this is O'Hara's movie.

371992,ATB8MP2M9L5PM,6303394051,"Transcendental Thomist ""jeb815""","[0, 0]","John Candy made a lot of movies, some good and a lot of them mediocre. This whimsical 1989 romantic comedy, filmed in Chicago rather than some stand-in city, has a lot of panache and flavor in addition to a great cast. Candy is a Chicago cop who still lives with his overbearing Irish Catholic mother. For anyone who has mother issues, it's a hilarious comedic romp as Candy tries to break away and date a Sicilian mortician played by Ally Sheedy. What makes this material stand out from the usual formula comedy is the brilliant presence of frequent John Wayne collaborator Maureen O'Hara, who came out of retirement for this role as the mother. Her interactions with Candy are hysterical. Good supporting work comes from Jim Belushi as Candy's police wagon partner, Kevin Pollack as his brother, Macauley Culkin in a blink-and-you-miss-it early role as his nephew, and Anthony Quinn as a Greek widower with designs on O'Hara. Add a first-rate director (Chris Columbus of &#34;Harry Potter&#34;) and you've got a sentimental and sweet film that may well be the best overall film in Candy's brief career.",5,John Candy romantic comedy about Chicago cop & his overbearing Irish mom,1398211200,"04 23, 2014",2014,1104,"['John', 'Candy', 'made', 'lot', 'movies', 'good', 'lot', 'mediocre', 'whimsical', '1989', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'filmed', 'Chicago', 'rather', 'stand-in', 'city', 'lot', 'panache', 'flavor', 'addition', 'great', 'cast', 'Candy', 'Chicago', 'cop', 'who', 'still', 'overbearing', 'Irish', 'Catholic', 'mother', 'anyone', 'who', 'mother', 'issues', 'hilarious', 'comedic', 'romp', 'Candy', 'break', 'away', 'date', 'Sicilian', 'mortician', 'played', 'Ally', 'Sheedy', 'What', 'material', 'stand', 'usual', 'formula', 'comedy', 'brilliant', 'presence', 'frequent', 'John', 'Wayne', 'collaborator', 'Maureen', ""O'Hara"", 'who', 'came', 'retirement', 'role', 'mother', 'interactions', 'Candy', 'are', 'hysterical', 'Good', 'supporting', 'work', 'Jim', 'Belushi', 'Candy', 'police', 'wagon', 'partner', 'Kevin', 'Pollack', 'brother', 'Macauley', 'Culkin', 'blink-and-you-miss-it', 'early', 'role', 'nephew', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'Greek', 'widower', 'designs', ""O'Hara"", 'Add', 'first-rate', 'director', 'Chris', 'Columbus', '34', 'Harry', 'Potter', '34', ""'ve"", 'got', 'sentimental', 'sweet', 'film', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'best', 'overall', 'film', 'Candy', 'brief', 'career']",Only the Lonely VHS
