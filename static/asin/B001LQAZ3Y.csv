1215644,A3BW98UPFB2XXW,B001LQAZ3Y,Frank Rizzo,"[14, 14]","This is a disturbing look into the lives of 3 traveling exhibitionists who dance with and do tricks with large cats.  Ron and Joy bring in another player, who they both fall deeply in love with.  Chuck seems to be the crux of the matter, the hinge point upon which the balance of their world goes awry.  Ron recounts this sad tale.  He is a strange man in appearance, mannerisims, and in the way he assigns importance or weight to certain aspects of the narrative.  At times I'm not sure I believe what he is saying at all; some of it is simply too bizarre.  But, I don't think Ron is trying to deceive, but only that he is shell shocked and has beaten down by life to near insanity.  He is a kind and loving man, of that there is not doubt.  I would also say that both Joy and Ron do seem to know these cats, as well as one can.  The moments where Joy discusses what is going in in these animals heads are pretty amazing.  I wonder if their obsession with Chuck took off the edge, created a bit of slack in their situational awareness.  It seems to have lead to their aquisition of Jupiter, to disasterous result.  Nearly everything about these people is a head scratcher.  Love triangles, tiger maulings, wigs, tight fitting costumes...it's a strange recipe.  But, that's how they chose to spend their nickle, and it made them happy, which probably is all that matters.",4,Strange but well worth watching.,1229385600,"12 16, 2008",2008,1371,"['disturbing', 'look', 'lives', '3', 'traveling', 'exhibitionists', 'who', 'dance', 'do', 'tricks', 'large', 'cats', 'Ron', 'Joy', 'bring', 'player', 'who', 'fall', 'deeply', 'love', 'Chuck', 'be', 'crux', 'matter', 'hinge', 'point', 'balance', 'world', 'awry', 'Ron', 'sad', 'tale', 'strange', 'man', 'appearance', 'mannerisims', 'way', 'importance', 'weight', 'certain', 'aspects', 'narrative', 'times', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'believe', 'what', 'saying', 'simply', 'too', 'bizarre', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Ron', 'trying', 'deceive', 'only', 'shell', 'shocked', 'beaten', 'down', 'life', 'insanity', 'kind', 'loving', 'man', 'not', 'doubt', 'would', 'also', 'say', 'Joy', 'Ron', 'do', 'seem', 'know', 'cats', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'can', 'moments', 'where', 'Joy', 'what', 'going', 'animals', 'heads', 'are', 'pretty', 'amazing', 'wonder', 'obsession', 'Chuck', 'took', 'off', 'edge', 'created', 'bit', 'slack', 'situational', 'awareness', 'have', 'lead', 'aquisition', 'Jupiter', 'disasterous', 'result', 'Nearly', 'everything', 'people', 'head', 'scratcher', 'Love', 'triangles', 'tiger', 'maulings', 'wigs', 'tight', 'fitting', 'costumes', 'strange', 'recipe', 'how', 'chose', 'spend', 'nickle', 'made', 'happy', 'probably', 'matters']",Cat Dancers

Wait until you hear this...This is the story about how the best intentions can go so so wrong. How the purest love can turn into the darkest of horrors and how love can live on and still shine brightly for everyone else to see, even if everything appears to be blood red for a while.When they received their first big cat from a Hollywood celebrity, they had no clue what to do with it so they treated it like a child. Instead of getting an education (which they eventually did), they added the animal to their act, got more famous and then just kept adding more animals, poorly trained (at first), to their act. Money was made, they lived very large and the price they paid was so dear, so tragic, so unbelievable, it made me feel so sad.They made tons of mistakes, assigning the animals human emotions, treating the cats like children (including holding grudges against them), and basically doing all the same things that we all do with our pets. Except their pets happened to be 300-pound tigers.In the end, I really loved Ron Holiday and I wanted to give him a hug and tell him time heals. He suffered a lot and had an unconquerable spirit. I hope he does make it to the Tiger Temple in Thailand. From this documentary, I took his spirit and attitude. He made me see that the human heart can endure massive pain and still come through like a champion, inspiring others. I think that is truly what this documentary is about. Sorry if that sounds hopelessly lame. But for me, that's what it was about.",5,Ron Holiday's Unconquerable Spirit,1229472000,"12 17, 2008",2008,1579,"[""'ve"", 'heard', ""'Siegfried"", 'Roy', 'nothing', 'compared', 'Wait', 'hear', 'story', 'how', 'best', 'intentions', 'can', 'go', 'so', 'so', 'wrong', 'How', 'purest', 'love', 'can', 'turn', 'darkest', 'horrors', 'how', 'love', 'can', 'live', 'still', 'shine', 'brightly', 'everyone', 'else', 'see', 'even', 'everything', 'be', 'blood', 'red', 'while.When', 'received', 'first', 'big', 'cat', 'Hollywood', 'celebrity', 'had', 'clue', 'what', 'do', 'treated', 'child', 'Instead', 'getting', 'education', 'eventually', 'did', 'added', 'animal', 'act', 'got', 'more', 'famous', 'then', 'just', 'kept', 'adding', 'more', 'animals', 'poorly', 'trained', 'first', 'act', 'Money', 'was', 'made', 'lived', 'very', 'large', 'price', 'paid', 'was', 'so', 'dear', 'so', 'tragic', 'so', 'unbelievable', 'made', 'feel', 'so', 'sad.They', 'made', 'tons', 'mistakes', 'assigning', 'animals', 'human', 'emotions', 'treating', 'cats', 'children', 'including', 'holding', 'grudges', 'basically', 'doing', 'same', 'things', 'do', 'pets', 'pets', 'happened', 'be', '300-pound', 'end', 'really', 'loved', 'Ron', 'Holiday', 'wanted', 'give', 'hug', 'tell', 'time', 'heals', 'suffered', 'lot', 'had', 'unconquerable', 'spirit', 'hope', 'make', 'Tiger', 'Temple', 'Thailand', 'documentary', 'took', 'spirit', 'attitude', 'made', 'see', 'human', 'heart', 'can', 'endure', 'massive', 'pain', 'still', 'come', 'champion', 'inspiring', 'others', 'think', 'truly', 'what', 'documentary', 'about', 'Sorry', 'hopelessly', 'lame', 'what', 'was', 'about']",Cat Dancers
1215646,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B001LQAZ3Y,Kevin Killian,"[0, 3]","I wasn't crazy about the way the filmmakers decided to ""distress"" so much of the older color film, to make it look incredibly old.  Or worse, as when Ron remembers the tragic day his second loss took place, the film seems splotched with blood--a sadly cheap and gimmicky effect.Filmmakers seem to take Ron's account of ""Cat Dancers"" pretty straightforwardly, but I would have preferred a more authoritative approach.  Couldn't they find anyone else to interview for the movie (outside of Chuck's mom, who appears only on audio)?  How old were Ron and Joy anyhow?  We get only vague references to actual dates, but I'm wondering were they actually born in the 1920s?  If so, they were amazingly old when they encountered the young, virile, crush magnet Chuck Lizza.  Yes, it would have been nice if some disinterested party had described the career of the Cat Dancers in terms we could understand.  Were they really bigger than Siegfried and Roy?  Seems hard to believe.  According to Ron, they were already big stars when they met Tennessee Williams in Key West shortly after the Broadway premiere of CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF (what a prophetic title!)--so that must have been 1955.  In the 1970s they're still looking pretty good, but man oh man, if that's what happens to you when you spend your life feeding cats in Florida, lord preserve us from that harsh sun!  I'm glad I'm lost in the fog in San Francisco.  Ron and Joy had great bodies but those faces were like dried up hamburgers.I like Ron, though after watching ""Mr. G"" on the Australian series HBO imported this autumn ""Summer Heights High,"" that colored it a bit for me since Ron seems so much like the fictional, and horrid, Mr. G (a drama teacher at the fictional Oz high school).  It is a tragic story and nothing will change the bitter ending, but I think Ron might have been better served by a director willing to put his story into some context, instead of making it GREY GARDENS II.",4,Memory,1232409600,"01 20, 2009",2009,1949,"['was', ""n't"", 'crazy', 'way', 'filmmakers', 'decided', 'distress', 'so', 'much', 'older', 'color', 'film', 'make', 'look', 'incredibly', 'old', 'worse', 'when', 'Ron', 'tragic', 'day', 'second', 'loss', 'took', 'place', 'film', 'splotched', 'blood', 'sadly', 'cheap', 'gimmicky', 'effect.Filmmakers', 'seem', 'take', 'Ron', 'account', 'Cat', 'Dancers', 'pretty', 'straightforwardly', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'more', 'authoritative', 'approach', 'Could', ""n't"", 'find', 'anyone', 'else', 'interview', 'movie', 'Chuck', 'mom', 'who', 'only', 'audio', 'How', 'old', 'were', 'Ron', 'Joy', 'anyhow', 'get', 'only', 'vague', 'references', 'actual', 'dates', ""'m"", 'wondering', 'were', 'actually', 'born', '1920s', 'so', 'were', 'amazingly', 'old', 'when', 'encountered', 'young', 'virile', 'crush', 'magnet', 'Chuck', 'Lizza', 'Yes', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'disinterested', 'party', 'had', 'described', 'career', 'Cat', 'Dancers', 'terms', 'could', 'understand', 'Were', 'really', 'bigger', 'Siegfried', 'Roy', 'Seems', 'hard', 'believe', 'According', 'Ron', 'were', 'already', 'big', 'stars', 'when', 'met', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'Key', 'West', 'shortly', 'Broadway', 'premiere', 'CAT', 'ON', 'A', 'HOT', 'TIN', 'ROOF', 'what', 'prophetic', 'title', 'must', 'have', 'been', '1955', '1970s', ""'re"", 'still', 'looking', 'pretty', 'good', 'man', 'man', 'what', 'when', 'spend', 'life', 'feeding', 'cats', 'Florida', 'lord', 'preserve', 'harsh', 'sun', ""'m"", 'glad', ""'m"", 'lost', 'fog', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Ron', 'Joy', 'had', 'great', 'bodies', 'were', 'dried', 'up', 'hamburgers.I', 'Ron', 'though', 'watching', 'Mr.', 'G', 'Australian', 'series', 'HBO', 'imported', 'autumn', 'Summer', 'Heights', 'High', 'colored', 'bit', 'Ron', 'so', 'much', 'fictional', 'horrid', 'Mr.', 'G', 'drama', 'teacher', 'fictional', 'Oz', 'high', 'school', 'tragic', 'story', 'nothing', 'will', 'change', 'bitter', 'ending', 'think', 'Ron', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'served', 'director', 'willing', 'put', 'story', 'context', 'instead', 'making', 'GREY', 'GARDENS', 'II']",Cat Dancers
1215647,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B001LQAZ3Y,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[6, 8]","HBO Documentaries always grab my attention.  They usually fall into one of two categories:  simply wonderful or truly trash.  ""Cat Dancers"" falls into the first category.  It's a loving and somewhat eerie look into the lives of Ron and Joy Holiday and their relationship with big cats and a young protege, Chuck Lizza.The documentary premiered last night and has been plugged for weeks.  I was captivated by the story of this couple who grew up together and eventually married.  They became world-famous adagio ballet dancers but peaked in their early thirties (according to Ron in the documentary).Looking for work, they eventually found themselves in the world of big cat training and performance.  They gained knowledge on the subject through reading and much trial-and-error.The documentary goes on to give us a glimpse into the life of this couple as the ""Cat Dancers.""  Ron Holiday is brought close to tears (and eventually gives in) many times as he opens up about his life, his love of Joy and Chuck and his deep connection to the cats.  We learn a little history of each of the Holiday's animals, from Shercon to Jupiter, the white tiger lovingly referred to as ""Mr. Perfect.""  We also see Ron teach a class of students on the exotics farm on which he keeps his remaining animals.  The documentary ends with two terrible tragedies that I won't reveal here.One thing is for certain, the Holidays had a truly amazing bond with their cats and with Chuck Lizza.  The bond shared between the humans and cats was very strong and very passionate.This is an intimate portrait of three lives that intertwined to create something truly beautiful.  While it can sometimes be bizarre, this story is a beautiful and tender look into the lives of some truly amazing performers.  I highly recommend it.",4,A Strangely Touching Documentary,1229385600,"12 16, 2008",2008,1796,"['HBO', 'Documentaries', 'always', 'grab', 'attention', 'usually', 'fall', 'one', 'two', 'categories', 'simply', 'wonderful', 'truly', 'trash', 'Cat', 'Dancers', 'first', 'category', 'loving', 'somewhat', 'eerie', 'look', 'lives', 'Ron', 'Joy', 'Holiday', 'relationship', 'big', 'cats', 'young', 'protege', 'Chuck', 'Lizza.The', 'documentary', 'premiered', 'last', 'night', 'been', 'plugged', 'weeks', 'was', 'captivated', 'story', 'couple', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'together', 'eventually', 'married', 'became', 'world-famous', 'adagio', 'ballet', 'dancers', 'peaked', 'early', 'thirties', 'according', 'Ron', 'documentary', '.Looking', 'work', 'eventually', 'found', 'world', 'big', 'cat', 'training', 'performance', 'gained', 'knowledge', 'subject', 'reading', 'much', 'trial-and-error.The', 'documentary', 'give', 'glimpse', 'life', 'couple', 'Cat', 'Dancers', 'Ron', 'Holiday', 'brought', 'close', 'tears', 'eventually', 'many', 'times', 'up', 'life', 'love', 'Joy', 'Chuck', 'deep', 'connection', 'cats', 'learn', 'little', 'history', 'Holiday', 'animals', 'Shercon', 'Jupiter', 'white', 'tiger', 'lovingly', 'referred', 'Mr', 'Perfect', 'also', 'see', 'Ron', 'teach', 'class', 'students', 'exotics', 'farm', 'remaining', 'animals', 'documentary', 'ends', 'two', 'terrible', 'tragedies', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'here.One', 'thing', 'certain', 'Holidays', 'had', 'truly', 'amazing', 'bond', 'cats', 'Chuck', 'Lizza', 'bond', 'shared', 'humans', 'cats', 'was', 'very', 'strong', 'very', 'passionate.This', 'intimate', 'portrait', 'three', 'lives', 'intertwined', 'create', 'something', 'truly', 'beautiful', 'can', 'sometimes', 'be', 'bizarre', 'story', 'beautiful', 'tender', 'look', 'lives', 'truly', 'amazing', 'performers', 'highly', 'recommend']",Cat Dancers
