I read the reviews before buying it, and for the guy who says that there isn't any action in it - there is only one sequence where we are shown video clips of what happened, and they were very short clips, but the rest of the movie showed constant action, deeply emotional scenes, that explained the characters, who they are, how they got that way, and how they are evolving through this crucial point in their lives.The subject matter is brutal, and so is some of the action. I can only say the bad guys should have suffered more!I recently bought two Korean action films - and both of them were excellent. It is very exciting to watch this developing area of film expertise. I enjoy watching martial arts movies - and The Man From Nowhere combined several different martial arts forms including some from southern Asia and the Phillipines. The other film was The Good, The Bad, The Weird. It is well done also - but doesn't have the emotional depth the The Man From Nowhere has. This film is excellent and worth repeated viewing.

Sure, the stories of the films are different but the common thread i.e. of a man on a rampage trying to rescue a young child from the clutches of her captors. In this movie, the main character, the hero is a shadow of his former past, he used to be a special ops person, but laying low running a pawn shop because his wife was killed by assailants. One of his neighbors, a little girl befriends him and a bond develops between them. The girl's mother is a junkie and steals drugs from the wrong people, who is turn capture this little girl is order to get their stash back. The Hero (Won Bin) goes out to rescue her.

The storyline was well thought out, the pacing was perfect, and reached its conclusion in a fantastic fashion. A good movie also makes you care about the characters and the situations they are experiencing. This has it all. The last half hour of the movie held my interest to a peak.

The main idea of the story is Taken by way of Man on Fire. Theres bits of the Bourne films in there as well though all films mentioned deal with secret agents away from the secret agent gig who come out of retirement to bludgeon evil with their hands.One of the main things that work in The Man from Nowhere's favor though is the relationship between the two leads who lead a well directed film with the right ammount of heart to make the plot matter. Won Bin (previously seen by me as the mentally handicapped son in Mother- bit removed from that one) has the silent warrior down pat with the film smartly revealing elements of his tragic past that do indeed work in deepening the character and the bits of psyche He does shwo through whats revealed. Kim Sae Ron though does steal the show as the little kidnapping victim. Asian movies in general always seem to push their emotional content highly and the film does do this with the character of Soo Mi but theres a strange natural ability in Sae Ron that makes her charming and worth the carnage that follows her kidnapping.The plot is a little more complex than the previous films though mixing organ smugglers with Korean gangsters but Lee Jeong Beom guides the action nicely running smartly on character to drive the film until an hour in when Won Bin does eradicate an office of gangsters. Theres more including two standout sequences involving a silent vietnamese assassin that standout. Comparing the movie to Bourne is a bit of diservice to the film. Nothing against Greengrass or Damon, but the action does contain that frentic real feel without being so hyper in the editing. Its easy to follow combatants which is more impressive since Won does a majority of the action himself. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention one thing I especially like. Any movie can have a knife fight but Beom gets a kudos from me for capturing amazing shots that come from the perspective of the fighters- blood even splashes the lens at one part.In the end for me The Man from Nowhere was one of the more entertaining suprises this year. I walked in with really zero expectations and watched a film that suprised me.The blu-ray is the way to go offering an excellent audio visual package. The action scenes do have more pop in High Def while the audio does get a work out especially during a scene set in a nightclub. Both the DVD and Blu have the same features including a making-of featurette, a compilation of scenes from the film edited together and trailer for the film.

This is the second Korean film I have watched after I loved ""I Saw the Devil"" and was hoping for the same type of quality experience.  However this was typical and tiresome.  After the last bad guy was killed in a routinely impossible super-spy manner, directly after confrontation with said bad guy masterminds almost equally skilled body guard, I shut it off before seeing the inevitable ending.  I truly didn't care one way or the other.  This movie is typical action, predictable, suspending reality throughout.  The lead in to help you develop your emotions for the character relationship didn't work for me either. I felt myself not caring one bit what happened to the characters.  Also the status quo 3rd party cops who just get in the way were of no consequence and provided no added suspension or tension to the movie.If you like mindless action, which some do, then this movie is for you.  I had high hopes coming in from a movie that was most likely just a gem in and of itself, not to mention that I am just sick of pointless action flicks with secondary plot lines and character development with sinister-s***-for-brains bad guys.

""The Man From Nowhere"" is simply magnificent!The winner of seven Korea Film Awards (the most awards ever received for a film in Korea) and multiple awards worldwide, the 2010 film ""The Man From Nowhere"" will be released on Blu-ray and DVD in the US on March 8th!""The Man From Nowhere"" was written and directed by Jeong-beom Lee (""Cruel Winter Blues"") and stars popular Korean actor Won Bin (""Guns & Talks"", ""Mother"", ""Taegukgi"", ""My Brother"").VIDEO:""The Man From Nowhere"" is presented in 1080p High Definition and is presented in 16:9 widescreen.  The picture quality of this film is absolutely wonderful as grime, blood and scars can be seen with detail on the characters.  You can see the detail of the suit and clothing of various people, including the buttons on their clothing.It's important to note that this is a bloody film known for its spectacular knife fight and its violence but by no means is it sadistic in a horror-film type of way.While a film that does showcase a lot of black and does take place during the nighttime, during the day-time scenes or neon-light club scenes, you do see the vibrant colors.  As for the action sequences, no blurring or any interlacing.  I saw no compression artifacting, DNR or any significant visual problems.  A pretty solid release PQ-wise from Well Go USA.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""The Man From Nowhere"" is presented in Korean and English 5.1 DTS-HD Surround Sound.  While there is an English dub version of the film, I do not listen to English dubs for live action Asian films and prefer to watch the film in its original language, Korean dialogue with English subtitles.  So, I can't comment on the quality of the English dub for this film.But as for the lossless audio, the dialogue is clear and there are a good amount of action scenes with car chases, car crashing, gunshots and action-sequences which can be heard through the surround channels.  While not a film that does have repetitive action that utilizes the surround sound and LFE to create an immersive soundscape, the lossless audio fits this film quite well and is pretty much crystal clear.The only audio that sounds distorted is the special features but overall, the film sounds great in HD on Blu-ray!SPECIAL FEATURES:""The Man From Nowhere"" comes with the following special features in standard definition:[...][...][...] Teaser - (1:08) A teaser trailer for ""The Man From Nowhere""[...] Full Trailer- (1:42) The original theatrical trailer for ""The Man From Nowhere"".[...] Highlights - (5:11) A feature that focuses on the important scenes between Cha Tae-sik and So-mi.[...] Making Of - (17:23) The making of the action-based sequences.  No dialogue but pretty much we can see how those scenes were created with the talent and the crew around them.EXTRAS:""The Man From Nowhere"" comes with a slipcover case.JUDGMENT CALL:I have been highly anticipating to watch this movie.  Having heard how it won all these awards in Korea and the fact that I have seen a good number of Korean films and very good ones that never won as many awards as ""The Man From Nowhere"", you can't help but think that this film must be special.And after watching it, I can definitely say that this film was truly one of a kind.  Stepping away from typical gangster or revenge films by focusing on the characters but also delivering in the action.I have watched Won Bin grow from Korean dramas and seeing him become a film star, but ""The Man From Nowhere"" is a film where he truly shines and what best than to have a story where you play this character that seems quite stoic but then seeing him as an individual with emotions that he has dragged on all these years because of a tragic circumstance.Also, the film does shed some light on the underground of Korea (which also happens in other countries of Asia) and where this film could have truly been hampered by terrible child acting, young actress Kim Sae-ron who plays So-mi, does it with so much emotion and adds to the film's efficacy.And while the dramatic portions are well-done, you have or will probably read how ""The Man From Nowhere"" has one of the best knife fighting scenes in a film.  As some Asian cinema fans may be used to seeing in samurai films with sword vs. sword battles, ""The Man From Nowhere"" is just impressive with its fight choreography that I was amazed.  There is no cheapening of the scenes, you are made to feel that the fight scenes look at feel right and never come out feeling disappointed by the results.This is classic planning and excellent execution when it comes to the action and in balance with great performances, well-written dramatic elements, ""The Man From Nowhere"" was just magnificent to watch and I enjoyed this film extremely.Granted, it is bloody and it is violent but the violence are nothing compared to a slasher, horror film, so it's easily tolerable and not scary at all.  But if you are sensitive to bloody violence, this film may not be for you.  But if you are open to it, this film delivers in riveting, pulse-pounding action and drama.  ""The Man From Nowhere"" is simply magnificent!So far, Well Go USA has delivered with its Blu-ray release of ""Ip Man"" and now with ""The Man From Nowhere"" and with the Asian films that they brought to the U.S. thus far, I'm excited to see what other films they tend to bring in the near future.Overall, there is really nothing for me to complain about this Blu-ray release.  Granted, I wish there were more special features and wish the features were in HD but other than that, ""The Man From Nowhere"" is a film that I can easily give my highest recommendation.",5,"Blu-ray: Riveting, pulse-pounding action and drama.

The extras include some scenes that shows Won Bin doing his own stunts. Holy Moses the guy has nerves.

The plot was okay- the story was fair. Adding the organ harvesting to the list of offenses perpetrated by the 'korean mafia' added some interest and also probably the biggest suspense part of the movie. I wouldn't say the fight sequences were over the top or very bloody. They were actually played down a bit, something different than what I expect to see in American films. There were no buckets of blood, none of the typical gore one would find in an American movie. The back storyline added to the film as well, somewhat, giving the main character at least some depth. Yes the movie ended in a way that may not have been what we would expect in America, but really it hammered home the main character's gumption to give everything he could to save the little girl.

1407843,AYG1U47VFZ165,B004H2CXBQ,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[40, 40]","Random acts of kindness make a `good action picture' into a `great action picture' with THE MAN FROM NOWHERESouth Korea's mega-popular THE MAN FROM NOWHERE was successful for very good reasons, so many that there's no way I could touch upon all of them in a single review.  Suffice it to say that it's an action picture whose formula is broad enough to appeal to men (once the action starts, there's never a dull moment), women (there's a strong through-line about caring for society's lost children), male teens (who wouldn't want to be as coolly quiet as the film's lead), and female `tweens' (I've been assured by ladies that star Bin Won is very `easy on the eyes').  If that winning combination isn't enough, then add to the mix the social messages and perhaps a metaphor on ""random acts of kindness"" and it's no wonder that the film was a huge hit overseas.Bin Won stars as Tae-sik Cha, who, quite literally, is the film's ""man from nowhere.""  As our story opens, he's seen doing his best to blend into the landscape, buying some sausage to eat in his small apartment.  He's treated like anyone on the street who has his slightly disheveled appearance: mostly ignored but slightly suspect due to his unkempt guise.  Arriving back home where he runs a pawnshop shop out of his apartment in a quiet, rundown tenement building (the place looks much like he does), he meets the young So-mi hiding in the darkness at the bottom of the stairs.  We soon learn that they're begrudging friends (of sorts), with Cha not taking any responsibility for the young girl (whose mother has essentially abandoned her to a life on the streets) but feeling tied to her more as the only responsible adult in her life.But So-mi's mother is guilty of more than being a bad mother.  In an attempt to make a big score selling drugs, she's stolen a small supply from the wrong people; and, when they show up looking for the stash, they're more than happy to take So-mi off the woman's hands because there's a big demand for black market body parts.  Who would miss one more deserted child?The mob never counted on Tae-sik Cha.Truth be told, Cha is a former government assassin, living a life of self-imposed exile after seeing his wife killed by one of his former enemies.  Now that he genuinely has nothing to lose, Cha realizes the only tether keeping him in this world is the young So-mi, so he makes it his personal mission to get her back alive no matter the cost.The story doesn't stop there, and the plot is developed on several layers.  There are competing mobs vying for control of the city's drugs and prostitutes, as well as the supply of human body parts, and, of course, the police can't be far behind.  What unfolds is an incredible tale of one man's spirit sinking to the depths of despair and rising to the challenge when he realizes that no one else - not the government, not the police, not anyone - is willing to do what's absolutely necessary to bring down the thugs who snatched So-mi away from her sad life.There's action a'plenty, and, in several daring twists of direction, not all of it takes place on scene.  In fact, Cha's opening salvo against one of the heavies who shows up looking for the stolen drugs doesn't even appear on screen; cleverly, we're only shown a window shattering from outside, and when the camera is back on Cha's apartment, the heavy is out cold on his kitchen floor.  Director Jeong-beom Lee clearly knows when to ""play the action"" and when to pull it back, providing the audience with sufficiently masterful hints as to what happened where we couldn't see.  The film remains taut throughout, right up until what is, arguably, one of the most incredible knife fights you'll see on film EVER.  I'm not talking samurai swords.  I'm not talking fencing.  I'm talking down-n-dirty knife fights.  Watch closely because you won't forget this choreography any time soon.Still, what surprised me most about THE MAN FROM NOWHERE isn't so much its penchant for violence, for which there's plenty but decidedly necessary given the circumstances.  What surprised me was the underlying message about hidden acts of kindness.  The story sprinkles them throughout - Cha allows the neglected So-mi to share a meal with him; So-mi gives Cha a funny little manicure while he's asleep; a kindly old store clerk who turns his head the other way so that the streetwise youth can shoplift some meaningless merchandise; So-mi puts a bandage on an injured killer's forehead cut; a grizzled police detective who grants Cha a parting wish - so much so that I can't help but think that they're all deliberate.  Each and every one of these moments is crafted in such a way to deliver a happy message in a film rife with grim elements: you will be repaid for that random act of kindness.  You will reap benefits from doing something good for strangers.  Your reward may not come instantly, and it probably won't announce itself with any pomp and circumstance, but it'll be there, and you'll know it when you see it.That's the hidden beauty of THE MAN FROM NOWHERE.  The gift of such a great film is far from hidden.  It's right there when you see it - laced with gunplay and plenty of derring-do - but you can't escape it.",5,"Random Acts of Kindness Make A ""Good Action Picture"" Into A ""Great Action Picture"" In

'You have an ex-special ops guy who finds some renewed sense of self and purpose through his friendship with a young girl, only to have it torn away with her being kidnapped by some bad guys.This is a densely plotted, brutal movie. I had a bit of a time keeping track of some of the players and some of the connective tissue tying certain things to other things, but the drift is plain enough. Repeat viewings should sew up unanswered questions.On the GOOD side there is much. The production values are very good. Good directing, editing, music etc. This is a very professional outing at all levels. Most of the acting seemed good as well. Or at least as best I could tell. For some reason I could not activate the English sub-titles and was forced to watch it dubbed instead, which will always put a damper on things.The storyline is involved and generally good. There were some dumb decisions in part (black market traffickers in human body parts don't generally have business cards), and the end was more than a bit maudlin, but overall it kept my attention.On the BAD side there are some things. A couple of the characters had hair styles that completely covered one of their eyes. What's THAT about?! I need both of my eyes to see comfortably.

Seriously, it's a suspense movie and the discussion revolves around the ending events.********The implied ending of the movie is the guy heads to the pokey for the rest of his life.  However, the police don't have much case against him.  Yes he did a lot of bad things but his defense is &#34;I killed a bunch of guys who were chopping up little girls and selling their parts&#34;.  And the police cracked into their own defense intelligence files through social engineering of sending death threats to the White House.The defense situation in South Korea is such that good relations with the US are absolutely critical for the survival of the country.  No kidding, straight up, any cops who sent that death threat would cause an international diplomatic incident the moment the word got out (and it would come out, because the army is going to find out everything about what happened to their guy going rogue.The only hope these cops have of staying out of prison is to disappear the guy.  Killing him will leave witnesses.  The only logical ending to the movie is after the credits roll, our hero looks up from the hug to see an empty street, and the cops are shredding every scrap of evidence that ties them to this ex army assassin.Meanwhile, South Korea is very, very connected to the net.  The story of a lone guy killing a ring that dissects children to sell their organs can't be stopped.  It can only be respun as a gang war, or a police operation where they obviously aren't going to give away the identity of the cop(s) who stopped it all.In any civilized portion of the US, no prosecutor would dare press charges.  In my state, were all the facts to come out, he couldn't legally be convicted anyway, as the killings were all in the proper defense of a helpless female child facing the most grisly murder possible.  But then, in my state, no cops would push for his conviction, no DA would take the case (political appointment), no grand jury would indict, any sane judge would dismiss (they're elected here), no jury would convict, and the Gov would pardon him.And like i said, South Korea's government might just shoot him, but no way would they let a death threat to the US pres get out.  And they wouldn't have to find out from their own cops, because the Secret Service would call the NSA, who would trace the email, read this guys file, see alarm bells go off (because a ROK army former assassin supposedly threatened the US pres).Hell, the sequel can be: The cops dropped him and left, and now the CIA is after him.

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[6, 8]","This story is about garbage and the pawnshop ghost and the friendship between them, and about gangstas getting bloody comeuppance. You take stock of a neglected, unloved, friendless child like So-Mi and you can't really question why she latches onto her quiet next-door neighbor CHA Tae-shik. She's desperate for someone to be in her life. Tae-shik is an enigmatic cuss. He runs a pawnshop from his cramped apartment and he doesn't encourage So-Mi's company as much as tolerates her presence. Maybe being tolerated is the best that So-Mi can hope for from a fellow person, So-Mi whose nickname of ""Garbage"" comes from when her mother learned she was pregnant with her and so kicked a garbage can. This is pretty heartbreaking stuff. Feel free to start rooting like mad for her.So-Mi's mom is a dancer in a club and predatory enough that she doesn't hesitate to steal from the local drug cartel. She's quick to involve Tae-shik in drug trafficking, this without his knowledge. Things get hinky for everyone when the drug dealers identify her as the wench what did them wrong. Suddenly, the brooding pawn broker is framed for murder. The little girl So-Mi is abducted. Tae-shik, the man from nowhere, whose personal file is blocked, escapes from the police station and begins turning the city upside down, looking for the little girl. It turns out - to absolutely no surprise from the viewing audience - that CHA Tae-shik has massive skills when it comes to brutal assswhoopin'. The vengeance he exacts from various drug smugglers and organ harvesters take on this ironic flavor; his punishment fits the crime. Tae-shik makes the tough DEA cops chasing him seem pretty superfluous.THE MAN FROM NOWHERE is a South Korean action thriller, and it's constructed adeptly enough, and it's watchable enough. Like most of its ilk in Korean action cinema, this film is dark and bleak and mostly devoid of humor. There are also places in which the story plods. The action sequences are few and far between and they aren't awful, but there are only two sequences that make you sit up and take notice: late in the film when Tae-shik, in a vicious blood bath, goes kabonkers taking out eight or ten goons and then the stunning point-of-view knife fight that happens right after.Won Bin, who plays the lead role and looks like a younger (and taller) Jet Li, has screen presence but is hampered by his role calling for him to be moody and depressed and emotionally detached. Young Kim Sae-Ron, who plays So-Mi, has better material to work with and she milks her part for all its worth. She's very good, and she and Won Bin have this sister-big brother chemistry going on. Another element that works well is the cast of villains, some of whom are pretty colorful wackadoos. What's up with the crazy muscle who only speaks in English? Whatever his deal is, he gives the pawn broker the best fight in the movie.The DVD's bonus material: The Making Of THE MAN FROM NOWHERE - includes interviews with lead actors Won Bin and Kim Sae-Ron and the director (with English sub-titles), fight rehearsals, and Won Bin performing repeated takes of several of the film's stunt sequences (00:17:22 minutes long); ""Highlights"" replays key moments from the film; think of this segment as the cliff notes version of the film (00:05:11); and the teaser and trailer for THE MAN FROM NOWHERE.",4,"""I run a pawnshop.

What some see as a crutch I thought was a pretty good starting point in recommending the film to friends. If you take the movies that TMFN has been to compared to you already know that a. someone gets kidnapped and b. someone else goes bad ass to get them back. While that's the basic plot of all these films, as far as I'm concerned, that's where the comparison stops. There is adequate action and acting in the movie with the strongest acting coming from Kim Sae-ron (whom I've come to call the Korean Dakota Fanning).

I agree with all the positive reviews completely, so I will avoid repeating the same concepts and instead try to add something new. The director Jeong Beom LEE was greatly influenced by the classical European directors and other great Asian directors, especially Akira KUROSAWA. Any fan of Kurosawa will immediately notice and feel the similar storytelling that is absorbing, engaging and entertaining. KUROSAWA was able to make artistic films that were highly regarded critically and at the same time bring them to great commercial success. And LEE is showing us that he can follow in the same path with this film. In an interview LEE stated: ""...But what I'm really hoping to pursue is sort of finding the humanity and telling stories about people. The action is not my main focus..."" See article at [search his name on yahoo and will appear on the first page under the link for cine-vue.com]If you want to see an example of when violence is justified then watch this movie. Can anyone affirm that the violence portrayed in this movie was gratuitous, or avoidable under the situation? In the same article director Lee stated that he used the style of fighting called ""Silat"", originated and widely used in Southeast Asian countries like Malasya and Vietnam, and it was also used in the Bourne Identity series.For those new to Korean entertainment, I recommend ""War of the Arrows"" and ""Thieves (2012)."" Regarding TV miniseries available on Hulu.com or Dramafever.com, I recommend ""Chuno (Slave Hunters),"" ""Runaway Plan B,"" and ""Harvest Villa.""  There are excellent reviews of Chuno here on amazon and on dramafever. In my opinion they are guaranteed to wow you.Update: if you are hungry for more, then I recommend the following period pieces: ""Kingdom of the Wind"" and ""The Great Queen Seon Deok."" They will grab your attention from the first scenes, you will become addicted, and want to finish all the episodes non-stop in one viewing. And the music is truly beautiful and awe inspiring in all of them.For a moving love story movie I definitely recommend ""More Than Blue,"" if you like to know what is the meaning of falling in love, portrayed in beautiful modern poetry.",5,Not the average violent action movie.

Won Bin helps make the two hours pass by quickly with his reserved portrayal of a lonely man quietly holding in his painful past. You immediately connect with him and with his friendship with neighbor, the little So Mi. Kim Sae Ron is a fresh little talent that also equally gets you to care about her character right off the bat.The film is definitely not for the faint of heart. It has a dark, grimy, seedy backdrop of the drug and human trade in Asia. The rage and vengeance that grows in Tae-sik as the movie rolls along adds even more to that foreboding and often bloody atmosphere. But that&#8217;s what makes the unexpected heart and sincerity all the more, well, unexpected.You&#8217;ve got to have a deft hand to be able to balance what would appear to be such contrasting themes, to have such a hopeful and touching undercurrent run through a film set in the midst of drugs and violence. But writer and director Lee Jeong-beom does just that. The excellent cinematography, most especially in a scene where the camera is step by step with Tae-sik as he jumps out of a window and lands right on the ground below, resonates to give the film its gritty essence. An excellently shot and well choreographed knife fight is also a highlight (and the bloodiest) of the film.Ajusshi/The Man From Nowhere has thrilling chases, exciting fight and action scenes, juicy and affecting twists and that heart-tugging sincerity that just explodes at you in the film&#8217;s final scenes.It only takes one little flashback to help you understand the friendship Tae-sik has with So Mi and what compels him to go to great and bloody lengths to save her. Never have I shed a tear at the end of a bloody action thriller that isn&#8217;t about a war. And I&#8217;m not afraid to admit that.The final scenes in particular were some of the best MaGMCs (Make a Grown Man Cry Moments) I have ever seen. And that is a testament to the writing, directing, and the stellar performances from Won Bin and Kim Sae Ron. I dare anyone not to feel a little tug on their heartstrings at the end of the film.Ajusshi/The Man From Nowhere is a completely satisfying and thrilling ride through revenge and hope and it is clear to see why so many people absolutely loved this film.",5,A Violent Action Thriller&#8230; With Heart,1386460800,"12 8, 2013",2013,2599,"['2010', 'Korean', 'blockbuster', 'award', 'winning', 'film', 'Ajusshi', 'international', 'title', 'Man', 'From', 'Nowhere', 'dark', 'violent', 'thrilling', 'film', 'maybe', 'unexpectedly', 'big', 'amount', 'heart', 'sincerity.The', 'film', 'brisk', 'even', 'runtime', 'almost', 'two', 'hours', 'Ajusshi/The', 'Man', 'From', 'Nowhere', 'quickly', 'punch', 'punch', 'Won', 'Bin', 'make', 'two', 'hours', 'pass', 'quickly', 'reserved', 'portrayal', 'lonely', 'man', 'quietly', 'holding', 'painful', 'past', 'immediately', 'connect', 'friendship', 'neighbor', 'little', 'So', 'Mi', 'Kim', 'Sae', 'Ron', 'fresh', 'little', 'talent', 'also', 'equally', 'care', 'character', 'right', 'bat.The', 'film', 'definitely', 'not', 'faint', 'heart', 'dark', 'grimy', 'seedy', 'backdrop', 'drug', 'human', 'trade', 'Asia', 'rage', 'vengeance', 'Tae-sik', 'movie', 'rolls', 'even', 'more', 'foreboding', 'often', 'bloody', 'atmosphere', '8217', 's', 'what', 'unexpected', 'heart', 'sincerity', 'more', 'well', 'unexpected.You', '8217', 'got', 'have', 'deft', 'hand', 'be', 'able', 'balance', 'what', 'would', 'appear', 'be', 'such', 'contrasting', 'themes', 'have', 'hopeful', 'touching', 'undercurrent', 'run', 'film', 'set', 'midst', 'drugs', 'violence', 'writer', 'director', 'Lee', 'Jeong-beom', 'just', 'excellent', 'cinematography', 'most', 'especially', 'scene', 'where', 'camera', 'step', 'step', 'Tae-sik', 'window', 'lands', 'right', 'ground', 'give', 'film', 'gritty', 'essence', 'excellently', 'shot', 'well', 'choreographed', 'knife', 'fight', 'also', 'highlight', 'bloodiest', 'film.Ajusshi/The', 'Man', 'From', 'Nowhere', 'thrilling', 'chases', 'exciting', 'fight', 'action', 'scenes', 'juicy', 'affecting', 'twists', 'heart-tugging', 'sincerity', 'just', 'film', '8217', 'final', 'scenes.It', 'only', 'one', 'little', 'flashback', 'help', 'understand', 'friendship', 'Tae-sik', 'So', 'Mi', 'what', 'compels', 'go', 'great', 'bloody', 'lengths', 'save', 'Never', 'have', 'shed', 'tear', 'end', 'bloody', 'action', 'thriller', 'isn', '8217', 't', 'war', '8217', 'not', 'afraid', 'admit', 'that.The', 'final', 'scenes', 'particular', 'were', 'best', 'MaGMCs', 'Make', 'Grown', 'Man', 'Cry', 'Moments', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'testament', 'writing', 'directing', 'stellar', 'performances', 'Won', 'Bin', 'Kim', 'Sae', 'Ron', 'dare', 'anyone', 'not', 'feel', 'little', 'tug', 'heartstrings', 'end', 'film.Ajusshi/The', 'Man', 'Nowhere', 'completely', 'satisfying', 'thrilling', 'ride', 'revenge', 'hope', 'clear', 'see', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'film']",N/A

He deliberately cuts himself off from the outside world, except his young neighbour So-mi.Then a drug deal goes very bad and Su-mis's mother is involved leading the drug bosses and police to come calling. Then it all kicks off. We are told the story of Tae-shik in flash back and how he came to be as isolated as he now chooses, and how he is actually an excellent if not ruthless killing machine.This then is a full throttle re take on the `Leon;' formula with a Korean twist. It is superbly acted and even if some of the `baddies' are a bit two dimensional it works as they are surrounded by so many more fully developed characters.

What follows after that is a excellent drama/action movie that touches on some pretty good topics like human trafficking, black market organ harvesting complete with the twist of adding a dash of racial civil unrest which at first seems random but actually makes a convincing plot device( which also leads to a funny moment in the police station in the aftermath of Cha's escape involving the chinese translator ). It was nice seeing each actor/actress become the role they were given from the main cast to secondary for example I really enjoyed the brother's bodyguard who while he doesn't show up a lot he makes each appearance a great one, I would even do a great disservice to the girl who So-mi befriended who got to go ""home""( the significance of her second appearance was part of a excellant scene )while being a drug mule. By the time you get to the dramatic conclusion of Nowhere you're on the edge of your feet seeing if Cha will be able to not only rescue So-mi but if he can even live to get there as another plus for this movie is that Cha isn't the untouchable movie hero as throughout his search he pretty much takes a beating, even catches a bullet and a couple of stab wounds.The picture quality on the blu-ray is great in it's 1080p transfer in a 2.35 1 aspect ratio, seriously this movie looks amazingly sharp and I see why it won a award for it's lighting and cinematography( the meeting at the meth den is a sight to behold as well as any of the outdoor night scenes ). On the audio end I will only touch on the subbed version as I haven't watched the fully dubbed version but what I did hear wasn't all that great but the korean audio is a 5.1 dts/hd master and it is amazing, during the golf clubhouse scene I could have sworn it was raining outside and I now know the sound a throat makes when it's been slit.The special features has trailers and a couple of other highlights but the best one is the making of feature that goes over the various big stunts of the movie as well as the visual effects( I see why they also won awards for this ). The packaging itself is also pretty good as it comes in a slipcase that has a different cover then the actual snap-lock dvd case complete with inside chapter select insert, this lets me know that Well Go USA didn't skimp on anything in localizing this and big props to them.If you like drama/action movies or movies like Taken or foreign movies in general then you'll enjoy thisGreat release for a great movie so it gets 5 stars",5,Blind purchase gone right,1301616000,"04 1, 2011",2011,3132,"['knew', 'nothing', 'movie', 'going', 'other', 'then', 'amazon', 'was', 'recommending', 'given', 'like', 'theVengeance', 'Trilogy', 'Sympathy', 'Mr.', 'Vengeance/Oldboy/Lady', 'Vengeance', '[', 'Blu-ray', 'hopped', 'youtube', 'watched', 'trailer', 'was', 'sold.The', 'story', 'pawn', 'shop', 'owner', 'CHA', 'Tae-shik', 'Won', 'Bin', 'who', 'ex-special', 'agent', 'who', 'movie', 'had', 'what', 'befriended', 'little', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'So-mi', 'Kim', 'Sae-Ron', 'also', 'annoyed', 'girls', 'mother', 'who', 'even', 'pawning', 'stuff', 'berates', 'calling', 'pedo', 'funny', 'thing', 'when', 'first', 'see', 'accomplice', 'robbing', 'gangsters', 'What', 'excellent', 'drama/action', 'movie', 'pretty', 'good', 'topics', 'human', 'trafficking', 'black', 'market', 'organ', 'harvesting', 'complete', 'twist', 'adding', 'dash', 'racial', 'civil', 'unrest', 'first', 'random', 'actually', 'convincing', 'plot', 'device', 'also', 'funny', 'moment', 'police', 'station', 'aftermath', 'Cha', 'escape', 'involving', 'chinese', 'translator', 'was', 'nice', 'seeing', 'actor/actress', 'become', 'role', 'were', 'given', 'main', 'cast', 'secondary', 'example', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'brother', 'bodyguard', 'who', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', 'lot', 'appearance', 'great', 'one', 'would', 'even', 'do', 'great', 'disservice', 'girl', 'who', 'So-mi', 'befriended', 'who', 'got', 'go', 'home', 'significance', 'second', 'appearance', 'was', 'part', 'excellant', 'scene', 'being', 'drug', 'mule', 'time', 'get', 'dramatic', 'conclusion', 'Nowhere', ""'re"", 'edge', 'feet', 'seeing', 'Cha', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'not', 'only', 'rescue', 'So-mi', 'can', 'even', 'live', 'get', 'there', 'plus', 'movie', 'Cha', ""n't"", 'untouchable', 'movie', 'hero', 'search', 'pretty', 'much', 'beating', 'even', 'bullet', 'couple', 'stab', 'wounds.The', 'picture', 'quality', 'blu-ray', 'great', '1080p', 'transfer', '2.35', '1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'seriously', 'movie', 'amazingly', 'sharp', 'see', 'why', 'won', 'award', 'lighting', 'cinematography', 'meeting', 'meth', 'den', 'sight', 'behold', 'as', 'well', 'outdoor', 'night', 'scenes', 'audio', 'end', 'will', 'only', 'touch', 'subbed', 'version', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'fully', 'dubbed', 'version', 'what', 'did', 'hear', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'korean', 'audio', '5.1', 'dts/hd', 'master', 'amazing', 'golf', 'clubhouse', 'scene', 'could', 'have', 'sworn', 'was', 'raining', 'outside', 'now', 'know', 'sound', 'throat', 'when', 'been', 'slit.The', 'special', 'features', 'trailers', 'couple', 'other', 'highlights', 'best', 'one', 'making', 'feature', 'various', 'big', 'stunts', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'visual', 'effects', 'see', 'why', 'also', 'won', 'awards', 'packaging', 'also', 'pretty', 'good', 'slipcase', 'different', 'cover', 'then', 'actual', 'snap-lock', 'dvd', 'case', 'complete', 'inside', 'chapter', 'select', 'insert', 'know', 'Well', 'Go', 'USA', 'did', ""n't"", 'skimp', 'anything', 'localizing', 'big', 'props', 'them.If', 'drama/action', 'movies', 'movies', 'Taken', 'foreign', 'movies', 'general', 'then', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'thisGreat', 'release', 'great', 'movie', '5', 'stars']",N/A

1407944,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B004H2CXBQ,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","A 2010 South Korean movie ""The Man from Nowhere"" (original title ""Ajussi"" meaning something like ""Old Chap"") centers on Cha Tae-sik (Bin Won, ""The Brotherhood of War""), a quiet pawnbroker with a mysterious past. His neighbors don't like the reclusive middle-aged man very much, but a little girl Jeong So-Mi (Sae-ron Kim), a neglected daughter of a club dancer living next door, feels differently. For her Tae-sik is Ajussi, someone elder the lonely girl can really trust.When So-Mi's mother, Hyo-Jeong (Kim Hyo-seo) gets involved in a drug deal, and So-Mi and Hyo-Jeong are kidnapped by the criminal syndicate, Tae-sik, an ex-special forces agent, embarks on a vigilante-like mission to make those who are guilty pay in an uncompromising way.The film's intriguing premise reminds us of action thrillers like Taken"" or ""Man on Fire,"" but the real strength of ""The Man from Nowhere"" lies in the unlikely bond between Tae-sik and So-Mi. After a rather sluggish first-half, the film gets faster and more intense before it reaches the blood-soaked climax, where bullets fly and knives are drawn, but obviously writer/director Jeong-beom Lee puts an emphasis on the character development over the plot, as Luc Besson did in ""The Professional"" (aka. ""Leon"").Bin Won is convincing as the lonely hero whose past still haunted him, but it is Sae-ron Kim who shines in ""The Man from Nowhere."" Thanayong Wongtrakul from Thailand, who plays Ramrowan, a bodyguard hired by the syndicate, is also impressive. In my view, the film (South Korea's highest grossing film in 2010) is a success as a character-driven drama between Tae-sik and So-Mi, as well as action movie.",4,"(3.5 STARS) Lonely Hearts, Bloody Fights",1316304000,"09 18, 2011",2011,1654,"['2010', 'South', 'Korean', 'movie', 'Man', 'Nowhere', 'original', 'title', 'Ajussi', 'meaning', 'something', 'Old', 'Chap', 'centers', 'Cha', 'Tae-sik', 'Bin', 'Won', 'Brotherhood', 'War', 'quiet', 'pawnbroker', 'mysterious', 'past', 'neighbors', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'reclusive', 'middle-aged', 'man', 'very', 'much', 'little', 'girl', 'Jeong', 'So-Mi', 'Sae-ron', 'Kim', 'neglected', 'daughter', 'club', 'dancer', 'living', 'next', 'door', 'feels', 'differently', 'Tae-sik', 'Ajussi', 'someone', 'elder', 'lonely', 'girl', 'can', 'really', 'trust.When', 'So-Mi', 'mother', 'Hyo-Jeong', 'Kim', 'Hyo-seo', 'involved', 'drug', 'deal', 'So-Mi', 'Hyo-Jeong', 'are', 'kidnapped', 'criminal', 'syndicate', 'Tae-sik', 'ex-special', 'forces', 'agent', 'vigilante-like', 'mission', 'make', 'who', 'are', 'guilty', 'pay', 'uncompromising', 'way.The', 'film', 'intriguing', 'premise', 'action', 'thrillers', 'Taken', 'Man', 'Fire', 'real', 'strength', 'Man', 'Nowhere', 'unlikely', 'bond', 'Tae-sik', 'So-Mi', 'rather', 'sluggish', 'first-half', 'film', 'faster', 'more', 'intense', 'blood-soaked', 'climax', 'where', 'bullets', 'fly', 'knives', 'are', 'drawn', 'obviously', 'writer/director', 'Jeong-beom', 'Lee', 'emphasis', 'character', 'development', 'plot', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'did', 'Professional', 'aka', 'Leon', '.Bin', 'Won', 'convincing', 'lonely', 'hero', 'past', 'still', 'haunted', 'Sae-ron', 'Kim', 'who', 'Man', 'Nowhere', 'Thanayong', 'Wongtrakul', 'Thailand', 'who', 'Ramrowan', 'bodyguard', 'hired', 'syndicate', 'also', 'impressive', 'view', 'film', 'South', 'Korea', 'highest', 'grossing', 'film', '2010', 'success', 'character-driven', 'drama', 'Tae-sik', 'So-Mi', 'as', 'well', 'action', 'movie']",N/A
