After all, it had the inestimable Christopher Walken in it, on top of a variety of other good and interesting actors. In general, I like most so-called &#34;Independent&#34; movies, movies a bit off kilter from the mainstream. Unfortunately, within that grouping lie movies that are often off kilter just for the sake of being off kilter. The movie consists of the exact same 20 minutes of time viewed from 5 different perspectives and I assume to show how one small change can exert large differences in outcomes, a take on the old philosophical adage that a butterfly flapping its wings can begin a Hurricane. I can see the same sort of &#34;Oh, wow&#34; factor here if the same 60's college students smoking the same products were flexing their pseudo intellectual muscles, so to speak. The violence didn't bother me, though is was graphic. It just seemed to be a bit of a mess that got away from whatever it was supposed to be. If you see it on a cable station for free, and you have a bit of time to kill, go ahead, watch it. I wouldn't pay to see it though, even at the cheaper prices offered for streaming.

I figured there was no way this would play very long here (and I was right, the movie was gone after one week), so I went to see it right away.""The Power of Few"" (2013 release; 95 min.) brings the same 20 min. in an early afternoon in New Orleans, but brought from multiple (five, actually) perspectives, and how these intersecting stories play out/touch on each other/collide (literally). Given that you watch the ""same"" 20 minutes five times over the course of the movie, there is no point in even trying to bring an introduction of the movie's plot. Let's just say that blood WILL be spilled at this particular New Orleans intersection.Several comments: it's amazing what an all-star cast is attached to this movie, starting of course with Christopher Walken as a homeless man with a secret. I don't recall ever having seen Walken so scrungy looking. Then there is Christian Slater as the undercover agent (along with his partner, played by up-and-coming Australian actress Nicky Whelan), trying to recover a mysterious package. We also have rapper Juvenile as one of the gangsters, and Q'orianka Kilcher as the messenger (and also co-producer AND contributing several songs to the very pleasant movie soundtrack). But the key figure is the title character Few (played by newcomer Tione Johnson), a candy-obsessed young lady who isn't feeling so good from eating all that candy while walking home, and who decides to hitch a ride home, unintentionally finding herself at the center of this movie. This is the long-feature debut of writer-director Leone Marucci. As the credits were rolling at the end of the movie, it seemed that a BUNCH of people named Marucci had some involvement on the set or in the production or the financing of this movie, so this was probably a Marucci labor of love long in the making.

Clyde (Christian Slater)  is an undercover agent seeking a mysterious package that could be extremely dangerous. Alexa (Q'orianka Kilcher) is the woman hired to deliver the package in question.Despite its impressive cast and first-rate performances, the film's director, Leone Marucci, doesn't keep the disparate elements of plot together, resulting in a sometimes rambling narrative frequently burdened with self-conscious, showy touches.Special features on the DVD release include a making-of featurette, deleted scene, and interviews with actors Christian Slater, Christopher Walken, and Anthony Anderson.",3,Fine cast in a disappointing effort,1374364800,"07 21, 2013",2013,1092,"['Power', 'Few', 'offbeat', 'story', 'crime', 'scene', 'draws', 'five', 'strangers', 'together', 'Set', 'gritty', 'New', 'Orleans', 'locations', 'film', 'five', 'parallel', 'sets', 'characters', 'Doke', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'verbose', 'homeless', 'man', 'obsessed', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'who', 'accompanied', 'homeless', 'dwarf', 'companion', 'most', 'movie', 'searching', 'food.Junkshow', 'Anthony', 'Anderson', 'tough', 'thug', 'hunting', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'testify', 'one', 'homeboys', 'Clyde', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'undercover', 'agent', 'seeking', 'mysterious', 'package', 'could', 'be', 'extremely', 'dangerous', 'Alexa', ""Q'orianka"", 'Kilcher', 'woman', 'hired', 'deliver', 'package', 'impressive', 'cast', 'first-rate', 'performances', 'film', 'director', 'Leone', 'Marucci', ""n't"", 'keep', 'disparate', 'elements', 'plot', 'together', 'resulting', 'sometimes', 'rambling', 'narrative', 'frequently', 'burdened', 'self-conscious', 'showy', 'touches.Special', 'features', 'DVD', 'release', 'include', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'deleted', 'scene', 'interviews', 'actors', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Anthony', 'Anderson']",N/A

A stolen religious artifact, a baby who needs medicine, a delivery driver who meets a man on the run from a gang, two agents looking for someone and two homeless men all become connected in one tragic event. This is the kind of movie where a series of events connect groups of people that otherwise have nothing in common. This one event is shown from everyone's point of view and how one person can change everything. I love movies like this. Movies that show the same event from many different perspectives. No movie has done it better then Rashomon but there have been many attempts since then. Most recently movies like Crash, 11:14 and Vantage Point have all used this style of filmmaking. I have enjoyed all those movies and I enjoyed this one as well. The only problem I had with this one is that some of the stories went on a little long and started to slow the movie down, but overall the movie was enjoyable and really keeps you watching and sucked in. Overall, a fun movie done in a type of style that I really love, which may skew my opinion but I think it's very much worth watching.

1645374,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00CBDG5Z8,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","Any movie featuring Christopher Walken is worth checking out. That's what I thought before watching ""The Power of Few,"" a crime drama told with multiple perspectives. I still do not change my mind about Walken's films (and here Walken does what he does best anyway), but ""The Power of Few"" is disappointing enough to almost make me do so.In fact, top-billed Christopher Walken is only in about one fifth of the movie. ""The Power of Few"" mainly consists of five separate narratives about characters played by, besides Walken, Jordan Prentice, Devon Gearhart, Moon Bloodgood, Christian Slater, Nicky Whelan, Anthony Anderson, Q'orianka Kilcher and Jesse Bradford. Five different narrative threads about people experiencing (or who experienced) violent things - secret operatives looking for something, a delivery girl helping out a young man running away from local gangsters, and so on.While on TV Larry King (played by himself) discusses a stolen religious artifact, these threads eventually converge towards the end in a not so intriguing fashion. Actually, there is another thread about a little girl who plays an important role in wrapping up the entire storyline. The idea has potential, but with each narrative that is too weak and uninteresting, she arrives a bit too late.Writer/director Leone Marucci is good at handling the film's crime-related section involving shootings and tortures, but the rest of the film is pretty dull with uninspired dialogue.
