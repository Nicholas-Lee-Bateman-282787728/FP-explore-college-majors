The production takes on a difficult task that, for me, was successful. I found this video to be well made, informative and entertaining. It is narrated by John Rhys-Davies and maintained a good pace as well as making subjects that could be a little boring seem very interesting.The video begins by highlighting the symbolism of the sword even in modern times, its continued use in film and entertainment. It moves swiftly to the story of the disappearance of the sword as a weapon on the battlefield and how the western way of the sword devolved into the sport of fencing.The video then moves to efforts in the last few decades to rediscover the western martial art of the sword by various groups, from medieval re-enactors to serious students of martial arts studying period manuals who attempted to work out how men fought with edged weapons hundreds of years ago.I thought this was a very good video for those interested in both the sword and western martial arts. It is a well-produced documentary with an excellent narrator. The finished product is something that is both informative and entertaining. Definitely worth the asking price for the those interested in military history, weapons or martial arts. I give it five stars!",5,Rediscovering the sword,1263686400,"01 17, 2010",2010,1313,"['video', 'attempts', 'rediscover', 'western', 'martial', 'arts', 'sword', 'production', 'difficult', 'task', 'was', 'successful', 'found', 'video', 'be', 'well', 'made', 'informative', 'entertaining', 'narrated', 'John', 'Rhys-Davies', 'maintained', 'good', 'pace', 'as', 'well', 'making', 'subjects', 'could', 'be', 'little', 'boring', 'seem', 'very', 'interesting.The', 'video', 'begins', 'highlighting', 'symbolism', 'sword', 'even', 'modern', 'times', 'continued', 'use', 'film', 'entertainment', 'swiftly', 'story', 'disappearance', 'sword', 'weapon', 'battlefield', 'how', 'western', 'way', 'sword', 'devolved', 'sport', 'fencing.The', 'video', 'then', 'efforts', 'last', 'few', 'decades', 'rediscover', 'western', 'martial', 'art', 'sword', 'various', 'groups', 'medieval', 're-enactors', 'serious', 'students', 'martial', 'arts', 'studying', 'period', 'manuals', 'who', 'attempted', 'work', 'out', 'how', 'men', 'fought', 'edged', 'weapons', 'hundreds', 'years', 'ago.I', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'video', 'interested', 'sword', 'western', 'martial', 'arts', 'well-produced', 'documentary', 'excellent', 'narrator', 'finished', 'product', 'something', 'informative', 'entertaining', 'Definitely', 'asking', 'price', 'interested', 'military', 'history', 'weapons', 'martial', 'arts', 'give', 'five', 'stars']",Reclaiming the Blade

There are some excellent sequences and anecdotes from actors who have used the sword in movies and those that train them and the relative differences between what we have all seen in the movies and how the Western swords were actually used in combat.

1242829,A3VNYMNK7OC7CM,B001V7UTP2,R. Sardrena,"[9, 21]","For a third-generation foilsman this sounded like a wonderful program - especially since it was narrated by the impressive John Rhys-Davies.  Unfortunately, this documentary exposes an ugly feud among sword-enthusiasts.  For years there have been taunts and sneers made by Medieval or Renaissance re-enactors against competitive fencers - usually of the ""That's not REAL fencing"" variety.  This documentary celebrates a subset of the latter who call themselves ""historical swordsmen.""  The narration belittles what it calls ""sport fencing,"" illustrating it as an aberrant twig on the tree of fencing tradition, and using competitive fencers' self-deprecating comments for support. The self-styled ""historians"" put down the ""impractical,"" ""rules-driven,"" ""pared-down"" nature of modern foil/epee/sabre fencing.While the interest that these ""historians"" have in ancient fencing texts is laudable, their blindness and prejudices are not.  There are verities about fencing that can't be understood unless one competes against an opponent; for example, parries and other movements are necessarily ""pared down,"" since wasting a fraction of a second leads to getting hit.  Secondly, they assume that ""real"" fencing involves broadswords, and give short-shrift to lighter weapons, such as rapiers.  Third, they don't need to ""reclaim"" anything, since competitive fencers have always been well-aware of the literary tradition of old fencing manuals.  I find it suspicious that these ""historians"" can't even employ the rich vocabulary of fencing terminology - at least not in this program.  The pejorative remarks made in this program against modern fencing's emphasis on thrusting with the point shows a shocking ignorance of the evolution of fencing theory - found in aging texts - over the past three-hundred years in this direction.  Modern foil progressed organically from training practices involving the very lethal smallsword - a weapon that isn't mentioned at all in this program.  Whether the Johnny-come-lately's like it or not, modern fencing is the inheritor of an unbroken line of fencing tradition.Though the emphasis in this program is on the ""martial art of Western swordfighting,"" it takes a few minutes to decry Kendo almost as nastily as it put down competitive fencing.  Due to the expertise of the man interviewed, a Korean swordfighting technique gets better treatment.In this mix of bad and good elements, legendary Hollywood fencing choreographer Bob Anderson is interviewed.  It's almost worthwhile to tolerate the taunts in the other parts of the program in order to hear him.  This program also devotes a great deal of time showing the design and production of heavy swords for Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" films.  Perhaps it's not coincidental that the narrator was one of the stars of those films, and that two of the main interviewees were also ""Rings"" stars.By the way, like my fencing forefathers, I've been challenged at times by ""reenactors"" and other cynics to demonstrate the validity of modern fencing techniques against them.  I've let them set the parameters of the challenge (usually placing the combat ""in the round""), and have never failed to place my point on target at will.  The producers of this film would be advised to do as well.",2,"""Reclaiming"" plays pointed politics.",1269648000,"03 27, 2010",2010,3274,"['third-generation', 'foilsman', 'sounded', 'wonderful', 'program', 'especially', 'was', 'narrated', 'impressive', 'John', 'Rhys-Davies', 'Unfortunately', 'documentary', 'ugly', 'feud', 'sword-enthusiasts', 'years', 'there', 'have', 'been', 'taunts', 'sneers', 'made', 'Medieval', 'Renaissance', 're-enactors', 'competitive', 'fencers', 'usually', 'not', 'REAL', 'fencing', 'variety', 'documentary', 'subset', 'latter', 'who', 'call', 'historical', 'swordsmen', 'narration', 'what', 'sport', 'fencing', 'illustrating', 'aberrant', 'twig', 'tree', 'fencing', 'tradition', 'using', 'competitive', 'fencers', 'self-deprecating', 'comments', 'support', 'self-styled', 'historians', 'put', 'down', 'impractical', 'rules-driven', 'pared-down', 'nature', 'modern', 'foil/epee/sabre', 'interest', 'historians', 'have', 'ancient', 'fencing', 'texts', 'laudable', 'blindness', 'prejudices', 'are', 'not', 'are', 'verities', 'fencing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'understood', 'one', 'competes', 'opponent', 'example', 'parries', 'other', 'movements', 'are', 'necessarily', 'pared', 'down', 'wasting', 'fraction', 'second', 'leads', 'getting', 'hit', 'Secondly', 'assume', 'real', 'fencing', 'broadswords', 'give', 'short-shrift', 'lighter', 'weapons', 'such', 'rapiers', 'Third', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'reclaim', 'anything', 'competitive', 'fencers', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'well-aware', 'literary', 'tradition', 'old', 'fencing', 'manuals', 'find', 'suspicious', 'historians', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'employ', 'rich', 'vocabulary', 'fencing', 'terminology', 'least', 'not', 'program', 'pejorative', 'remarks', 'made', 'program', 'modern', 'fencing', 'emphasis', 'thrusting', 'point', 'shocking', 'ignorance', 'evolution', 'fencing', 'theory', 'found', 'aging', 'texts', 'past', 'three-hundred', 'years', 'direction', 'Modern', 'foil', 'progressed', 'organically', 'training', 'practices', 'involving', 'very', 'lethal', 'smallsword', 'weapon', ""n't"", 'mentioned', 'program', 'Johnny-come-lately', 'not', 'modern', 'fencing', 'inheritor', 'unbroken', 'line', 'fencing', 'emphasis', 'program', 'martial', 'art', 'Western', 'swordfighting', 'few', 'minutes', 'decry', 'Kendo', 'almost', 'as', 'nastily', 'put', 'down', 'competitive', 'fencing', 'Due', 'expertise', 'man', 'interviewed', 'Korean', 'swordfighting', 'technique', 'better', 'treatment.In', 'mix', 'bad', 'good', 'elements', 'legendary', 'Hollywood', 'fencing', 'choreographer', 'Bob', 'Anderson', 'interviewed', 'almost', 'worthwhile', 'tolerate', 'taunts', 'other', 'parts', 'program', 'order', 'hear', 'program', 'also', 'great', 'deal', 'time', 'showing', 'design', 'production', 'heavy', 'swords', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'films', 'Perhaps', 'not', 'coincidental', 'narrator', 'was', 'one', 'stars', 'films', 'two', 'main', 'interviewees', 'were', 'also', 'Rings', 'stars.By', 'way', 'fencing', 'forefathers', ""'ve"", 'been', 'challenged', 'times', 'reenactors', 'other', 'cynics', 'demonstrate', 'validity', 'modern', 'fencing', 'techniques', ""'ve"", 'let', 'set', 'parameters', 'challenge', 'usually', 'placing', 'combat', 'round', 'have', 'never', 'failed', 'place', 'point', 'target', 'will', 'producers', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'advised', 'do', 'as', 'well']",Reclaiming the Blade

In today's world the sword has no military use whatsoever. Yet it has a enjoyed a revival of symbolic and meaningful power and strength. Nobody can deny the allure the sword has on the modern world. This documentary style work takes a look at that very concept.It is a documentary of sorts that describes the history of the sword and also delves deeply into the lasting impression that the sword has on us even to this day when swords are pretty much not of any military use. It is undeniable that the sword holds a place of symbolic power, strength and reverance in today's world. And this film explores this theme.There are lots of great tie ins to modern film,  and how the sword is still very much used in film, from star wars to period movies like Kingdom of Heaven. There is also lots of footage from these movies and an explanation of how the sword is portrayed and used in these movies.  There are also a lot of great interviews with archaeologists, film makers, sword makers and even actors including Viggo Mortensen from Lord of the Rings.Another interesting aspect that is covered in the documentary is the difference between European swords/martial arts and the Eastern swords and martial arts.Here are a few tasty snippets from the film:1. Want to know what brought the sword into its modern day prominence? It has got to be Oakshotts classification of Swords. you can see it here: Oakshotts classification of Swords2. Here are some great modern movies that stay true to having the sword fighting be authentic to the period the movie was made for:Rob RoyKingdom of Heaven (Director's Cut) [Blu-ray]Alatriste [NTSC/REGION 1 & 4 DVD. Import-Latin America]Gladiator (Widescreen Edition)Troy (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)And, there is lots of stuff about the modern practice and art of sword fighting through sub cultures like the Society of Creative Anachronism, and the HACA (The Historical Armed Combat Association).
