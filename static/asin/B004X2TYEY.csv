1431297,A2CKO47KWC90A0,B004X2TYEY,"10-yr-old Movie Critic ""Perry's Previews""","[24, 29]","The review will be published on We Chinese in America newspaper on the film's opening day 4-16-2010! and[...]I will also review this film on San Diego's KUSI channel 9 on opening day April 16 at 7:20 am.-----------------Have you ever had a dream or vision that is almost impossible to achieve?  In the film ""The Perfect Game,"" a rag tag gang of boys from a rural poor area of Monterey, Mexico had a dream of playing Little League Baseball in America.  Under their circumstances, you could call that dream impossible, but it is based on a true story in the 1950's.The main characters of this film are Angel Macias, the gutsy talented pitcher of the Monterey Little League team, and the straight-talking coach Cesar, who gives the team inspiration, courage, and lots of laps (hard work!).Angel became miserable once his older brother died and his father deserted him while grieving for the dead brother.  Angel ran away from home when he heard his father saying he would never be like his older brother.  He soon recovered his good spirit when he found a baseball that was the property of the St. Louis Cardinals team.  Each one of his friends was enraptured and in awe as they marveled at the real baseball (A ball was a big find in their village.  They were so poor that they used grass, yarn, and twigs to make a baseball).The budding team was still in need of a coach though, so Angel set out to find one.  While practicing his skills, he woke up a man having his siesta.  His name was Cesar who worked at the same steel plant as Angel's father, and he claimed that he was the coach of the St. Louis Cardinals.  With disheveled hair and dirty, sweaty clothes, Cesar did not look like a coach at all!  But what caught Angel's eye was his perfect pitch and unrivaled batting skills!  How did the coach of the famous St. Louis Cardinals end up in a dirt poor place like Monterey, Mexico?  You will find out that Cesar had a secret past...Another key character is the priest from the church in Monterey.  He gives the boys confidence, imagination, wisdom, and love with gentle strength.  He is like a solid rock for the boys to lean on.  The boys are connected to him and refused to play until he gave them the blessings.Under the leadership of coach Cesar, the boys went on an unimaginable winning streak across America, beyond their wildest dreams!In a moving scene in the film, the Mexican boys walked over to the lone black kid who was on the opposing American team, and shared their lunch with him.  In the 1950's, the racial landscape was an embarrassing page in American history: African Americans and Mexicans cannot share bathrooms or dining areas with whites.  So the discriminated united together.My favorite part of the film was when Angel and his dad made up at the end.  It was really touching and my mom even cried.  A funny scene was when the boys introduced the new player whose names was Mario to coach Cesar as ""good with girls.""The Perfect Game is absolutely Perrific!  It is flawless, and I give it 5 starfish, the first live action film to receive 5 starfish rating!  Wow, that is worth celebrating!  It has all the right ingredients that make a ""Perfect"" movie:  It grabs your attention right away with rich characters, awesome storyline, and unexpected twists and turns.  It even has some light-hearted romance mixed in, and sprinkles of humor throughout.  At the press screening, I heard explosions of laughter in the theater from kids and adults alike.  I urge everyone to go see this inspiring film when it opens on April 16!  Remember to bring a lot of Kleenex...I can relate to this movie because I had an almost impossible dream too and I achieved it!!!  I always thought that I am a better artist than a movie critic because I have been drawing since I was three and writing movie reviews since I was eight.  My dream was to become a real artist and filmmaker.  Last Friday (April 2), the Oscar-nominated animator Bill Plympton and his director friend Kevin Sean Michaels invited me to animate their next new film!  I was ecstatic when I heard the news!The new animation film, based on a true story, is about Ingrid Pitt, a young Jewish girl who survived the concentration camp during the Holocaust.  It is called ""Beyond the Forest.""  I met Bill Plympton and Kevin Sean Michaels last year at Comic-Con in San Diego where Plympton's animated short ""The Fan and the Flower"" (which I LOVED and gave 5 starfish rating) was screened at the San Diego International Film Festival.  Plympton and Michael were surprised to see the impromptu ""Hot Dog"" drawing I made right next to Plympton's own ""Hot Dog"" from his short with the same name.  We became fast friends right there!I have always loved movies and saw my first movie when I was three years old.  I became an ""accidental"" 8-year-old movie critic in November 2008 when my mom asked me to write a movie review for ""Charlotte's Web.""  She wanted me to do something more challenging after my 3rd grade teacher Ms. Joli Harris told her at the parent teacher conference that I was decoding words at high school level.  I could never imagine when I wrote my first movie review that one day I would have the opportunity to interview some of the most talented filmmakers from my favorite movies.  I was honored to meet and interview the Oscar-winning Pete Docter of Up, Oscar-nominee John Musker and Ron Clements of ""The Princess and Frog,"" Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders of ""How to Train Your Dragon,"" and multiple award-winning French animation master Michel Ocelot of ""Azur & Asmar.""  That's why ""The Perfect Game"" truly resonates with me.This movie is about faith, perseverance, teamwork, overcoming racial prejudice, and the power of dreams: If you believe, you can achieve!",5,A 5-Starfish Gem & the Power of Dreams!

This bio pic is based on a true story of  a group of boys from Monterrey, Mexico who become the first non-U.S. team to win the Little League World Series. This story is so simple and filled with heart.This film has everything going for it .... such things  as Disney youth  Stars Jake T Austin (from Wizards Of Waverly Place), Moises Arias (from Hannah Montana) and Ryan Ochoa (from A Pair of Kings).. and a supporting cast with such familar faces as Cheech Marin (from the new show ROB! andNash Bridges - The First Season), Bruce McGill (Rizzoli & Isles: The Complete Second Season,and Clifton CollinsThe Event: The Complete Series..and still this little movie had no big studio support...it died quickly out of the theaters and it shouldnt have! It is a beautifully well done film...that families should have seenIt is not showy or pretendious, it is a small film with a large story to tell, It is well told film-making with a heart and done at its best.

1431320,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B004X2TYEY,Chris Pandolfi,"[8, 18]","It's always disappointing when a movie doesn't quite work despite having its heart in the right place. ""The Perfect Game,"" the newest in a long line of inspirational sports dramas, is not only rote but also told with such dewy-eyed sentimentalism that its disclaimer of being based on a true story is in all likelihood an understatement. I have no doubt that the basic scenarios are all drawn from fact, but I have a hard time buying into the adolescent nature of the plot and the characters. What's the best way to describe it? Watching this movie is like watching a TV movie of the week; there may be elements of truth in it, but on the whole, it feels overly dramatized and considerably lightened, possibly as a way to make it appeal to a wider audience. I won't say that the movie is a failure, but it certainly isn't something I can recommend.The year is 1957. The place: Monterrey, Mexico. Here, we find little Angel Macias (Jake T. Austin), who loves Baseball and holds a special place in his heart for Sandy Koufax. He wants to be a great player despite the objections of his father, Umberto (Carlos G&oacute;mez), a bad-tempered, tragedy-stricken alcoholic who thinks dreams won't put food on the table. Angel is, however, encouraged by the soft-spoken, genial Padre Esteban (Cheech Marin), who recognizes that the local boys need something to keep them occupied besides making trouble. Soon enough, Angel finds a lone baseball lying on the ground and determines it's a sign from God, especially after Padre Esteban looks at the English writing on it and tells him it belonged to a saint (he conveniently ignores the other word on the ball, which is ""Louis"").As Angel practices throwing the ball at a bucket attached to a wall, he crosses paths with Cesar Faz (Clifton Collins, Jr.), down-and-out and bitter, recently returned to Mexico after having been laid off from his janitorial position in the United States. He was once a prospect for the St. Louis Cardinals, but he was rejected, in all likelihood because team management didn't want a Mexican playing for an American team. After much nagging, Angel and his group of friends convince Cesar to become their coach and recruit other players to form a new team. The training is rigorous (Cesar really has a thing for making the boys do laps), but in due time, they have their own uniforms and are ready to compete in the American Little League World Series, which starts in Texas and ends in Pennsylvania.A journalist named Frankie (Emilie de Ravin) is assigned by her paper's sassy editor (David Koechner) to follow the team across the country, despite her misgivings. She will, of course, grow to love the assignment, especially after noticing how often the team defeats their American competitors.And that's the crux of the story. I have no problem with inspirational films as a genre, but they have to be done correctly. ""The Perfect Game"" is so intent on being bright and uplifting that it often falls victim to overused, cloying plot tactics. Consider the overly simplistic way it addresses racism. At a diner, Angel and his teammates notice an African American boy sitting all by himself because none of the white kids want to be near him. One by one, the teammates go over to the lone boy and introduce themselves by pointing at food items and saying what they're called in Spanish. In that same scene, a waitress is shocked to see the boys smothering her beloved fried chicken with mole. Then she actually tastes it, and what do you know, she ends up liking it. You can practically see the thought bubble over her head: From now on, I will try it before I knock it.I also didn't appreciate the way the developing romance between Cesar and a Monterrey woman named Maria (Patricia Manterola) was handled; watching them together, they seemed not like adults but like tweens going on their very first date, always so shy and innocent and proper. Cesar in particular fumbles his words whenever he's around her, like an eight-year-old with a crush. If this were a lowbrow parody, he might be like Stan from ""South Park"" and vomit in sheer nervousness every time she approaches him.It's not so much that the film is predictable, because let's face it, sports movies generally are predictable, and we like them just the same. It's not even that something as basic as a language barrier was completely glossed over, most likely because it was just easier that way. I think above all, it's the sappiness with which the story is told. ""The Perfect Game"" is a well intentioned but mushy family drama, overloaded with contrivances designed to make you feel all warm and runny inside. I'm tempted to say that it's inspiring, but alas, I can't, because I know that inspiration can only be found in real people and real situations. It's not enough to keep the best parts of a real story and then replace everything else with sentimental fluff.",3,Too Sentimental to Score a Home Run,1274745600,"05 25, 2010",2010,4899,"['always',

I was thinking something along the lines of a cheesier version of ""The Sandlot"". Actually, this movie isn't really anything like that. And unlike ""The Sandlot"", this one doesn't have bad language or other content that might be concerning for parents.It, I imagine somewhat loosely, tells the true story of an incredible Little League win in 1957. No matter how you look at it, this story is a ""miracle story"" and is very inspiring. A key theme in the movie is faith in God. In fact, the kids even refuse to play without being prayed over and blessed before each game. Although the priest in the movie is ironically played by Cheech Marin (yes, of ""Cheech & Chong"" fame), he does a rather convincing job in the role. Besides the relatively clear theme of faith, the importance of hard work and dedication, the importance of family (there's a father/son reconciliation), and showcasing the problems of racism are other key themes.I would imagine that most kids will really enjoy this movie, and I suspect most adults will too. It's one of those that you just can't really help but smile at and leave feeling good. The acting and production quality were relatively good. Some of the acting was a bit stilted, but all things considered was perfectly fine. The movie definitely has a bit of ""kids movie"" feel but has a surprising amount of depth to it. One thing that I found really clever was that throughout the movie they inserted in real footage of the team from 1957 in a seamless way with the film - it really helped to remind you that you were watching something that did - at least in basic story - really happen.Reviewed by MoviesForChristiansmoviesforchristians [dot] org",5,Good Family-Night Movie!,1377216000,"08 23, 2013",2013,1804,"['good', 'family-night', 'movie', 'choice', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'depth', 'thought', 'would', 'have', 'just', 'looking', 'movie', 'case', 'was', 'thinking', 'something', 'lines', 'cheesier', 'version', 'Sandlot', 'Actually', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'anything', 'Sandlot', 'one', ""n't"", 'have', 'bad', 'language', 'other', 'content', 'might', 'be', 'concerning', 'parents.It', 'imagine', 'somewhat', 'loosely', 'true', 'story', 'incredible', 'Little', 'League', 'win', '1957', 'matter', 'how', 'look', 'story', 'miracle', 'story', 'very', 'inspiring', 'key', 'theme', 'movie', 'faith', 'God', 'fact', 'kids', 'even', 'refuse', 'play', 'being', 'prayed', 'blessed', 'game', 'priest', 'movie', 'ironically', 'played', 'Cheech', 'Marin', 'yes', 'Cheech', 'Chong', 'fame', 'rather', 'convincing', 'job', 'role', 'relatively', 'clear', 'theme', 'faith', 'importance', 'hard', 'work', 'dedication', 'importance', 'family', 'father/son', 'reconciliation', 'showcasing', 'problems', 'racism', 'are', 'other', 'key', 'themes.I', 'would', 'imagine', 'most', 'kids', 'will', 'really', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'suspect', 'most', 'adults', 'will', 'too', 'one', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'help', 'smile', 'leave', 'feeling', 'good', 'acting', 'production', 'quality', 'were', 'relatively', 'good', 'acting', 'was', 'bit', 'stilted', 'things', 'considered', 'was', 'perfectly', 'fine', 'movie', 'definitely', 'bit', 'kids', 'movie', 'feel', 'surprising', 'amount', 'depth', 'One', 'thing', 'found', 'really', 'clever', 'was', 'movie', 'inserted', 'real', 'footage', 'team', '1957', 'seamless', 'way', 'film', 'really', 'helped', 'remind', 'were', 'watching', 'something', 'did', 'least', 'basic', 'story', 'really', 'happen.Reviewed', 'MoviesForChristiansmoviesforchristians', '[', 'dot', ']', 'org']",N/A

Chris Pandolfini's review below eloquently addresses most of the flaws in this movie, and there are many.  ""The Perfect Game"" certainly does not feel like a film, but more like a 2 hour tv special without commercials.  The director and screenwriters seemed to have learned all of their methods for adding authenticity to a film from watching Nickelodian.  I doubt there were even 10 lines in this ""film"" that were believable.  Take for instance when the coach orders the team to run 10 laps.  The boys basically respond with ""awww shucks coach"" grins on their faces and obediently oblige without a complaint.  And if you like baseball drama, you won't find very much in this film, and that is a shame since this is supposed to be a baseball movie.  I've read that the actual game to which the title refers was one for the ages, an edge of your seat nail-biter.  However, the depiction of the game here is a total hack job.  Every play, pitch, swing seems more like posing for a camera shot than an actual game.

This movie is based on a book by W. William Winokur which is a true story. The story is about the little league championship tournament of 1957. It is one of those feel good family flicks but it should be considering who the film is about. There are some very grown up themes and events in the movie which I will get to later on.The film follows Cesar Faz after he loses his job as a janitor for the MLB team St. Louis Cardinals. He moves back to Monterrey Mexico where the local kids care only for baseball. When they find out he has a connection to a famous pro team they lath on to him. With the help of a local priest the boys convince him to become their coach. They eventually try out to become an official little league team and when they do they go for it all.This is a great flick that shows how passion for something no matter what the odds can lead you on to something great. These kids beat the top team from Mexico and went on to beat the U.S. teams as well. All of this leads them to the championship and a now legendary and only championship perfect game. They also come across racism and how the boys handle it is great, but they face all kinds of hardships on and off the field.Clifton Collins Jr. is excellent in this film and really is the character he portrays, from the pain and embarrassment he starts with all the way to the joy he feels because of these boys. Cheech Marin also is very good here and his chemistry with the kids seems to very genuine. Speaking of the kids every child on this film does very well, hard to do with child actors. The entire film was very well acted, written and directed in my opinion.This is a family film and is a true story, I am sure you know the type. But the movie has a certain charm that makes it a bit different from the others. I really enjoyed this movie and liked all the special features as well. I would recommend this flick t any one that likes this type of film.

Matched against kids outweighing them by 30 or 40 pounds, they ended up posting the only perfect game in the series' history to date. The team was made up of mostly poor kids who'd begun playing baseball just a few years before.  They had only homemade equipment and practiced on a dirt field strewn with rocks and glass.I vividly recall that series, and when THE PERFECT GAME played on limited release in a suburban theatre in my area, as a longtime Little League coach, I felt that I just had to see it.  I'm glad that I did.  Knowing what I know about the team depicted, it was readily apparent to me that the film stuck pretty much to the facts in the telling of its story.  I found the movie inspiring, and you will too as you witness what love of the game, dedication and hard work can do to make an impossible dream come true.

1431353,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004X2TYEY,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[8, 11]","If ever there was a movie that showcased the difference between ""Based on a True Story"" and actual reality, William Dear's ""The Perfect Game"" would stand as a prime example. While a serviceable entertainment that is completely expected and thoroughly non-challenging, the film doesn't feel the least bit authentic. Yes, it has heart. Yes, it aims to be a crowd pleaser. Yes, apparently many people love it. This genial and unassuming movie is family friendly and its deficiencies are easy to overlook--especially by younger viewers. What's not to love? Utilizing every established underdog cliche from every routine sports story, the film hits all the beats necessary to be comfortable and safe. Kids may well love it. But it takes a fantastic, and almost epic true story, and drains the realness out of history to become a lightweight comedic fable.The movie chronicles the formation of a misfit Little League team in Monterrey Mexico. In 1957, this motley crew crossed the border, challenged much larger and more experienced teams, and ascended to the Little League World Series. It was the first time an International team qualified for the World Series and the only time in history a perfect game was pitched during this competition. It is an absolutely stunning story! Had it been played straight, this might have made a powerful biographical narrative. These kids challenged all expectations and restrictions to be world champions. In real life, they came from an existence of poverty and hardship and faced bitter prejudice and overt racism. Don't worry, though, in ""The Perfect Game"" these are minor issues and mild lessons to be learned.The boys are remarkably precocious and modern. Their sass and attitudes reflect current sensibilities, but have little to do with the actual time period of 1957 or their culture. The coach (a nice Clifton Collins Jr.) is saddled with a strained comedic side plot--his attempts at romance are remarkably inept. The boys are certainly wise and witty on the subject of wooing the ladies. Nothing in Monterrey feels remotely real in its tone. Any unpleasantness (such as the aforementioned racism) is slight and easily solvable--or, at least, not worth revisiting in this feel-good saga. I didn't hate ""The Perfect Game."" As a work of fiction, it's a pleasing enough concoction. But the true and incredible story is done a disservice by this superficial portrait. Predictable and enjoyable--but lacking in genuine authenticity--I know I'm in the minority. I just wanted to experience the real story of triumph and not just another exercise in underdog cliche.

Especially in sports films, where it is more about winning, than the passion of the team. But there are some exceptions where the movie and the film do have both. That is the case with The Perfect Game, a story about the Monterey, Mexico team that make it into the Little League World Series back in 1957. The idea of the film was perplexing to me, when I first saw it. But all I saw in the team, was a team of little kids that had more passion for each other, faith in god and the joy of the game, than about winning their way into so many peoples' hearts. That is the case with The Perfect Game, but is the film worthy of the classic baseball films of the past, well yes and no.The Perfect Game tells the tale of a young washed-up baseball player named Cesar whom had desires of wanting to play with the St. Louis Cardinals. But through it all, feels at first a bit destroyed about not making his dream come alive, and sees a bunch of little kids whom had loved American baseball, and had the dreams of wanting to make it big like their heroes. Down on his luck, Cesar looks into the young Mexican misfits, as a gimmick, but sees real potentials in them. Following the heart and a deep desire of winning. He puts his team into the American Little League baseball games. Through it all, the Mexican team plays their way to the championships of the 1957 Little League World Series, bringing 2 countries together, in a time where America was racially divided in African-Americans, and Spanish-Americans as well in deep Southern U.S.A. The movie wasn't bad, but honestly there could've been a bit of better storytelling from the actors. Also, there could've been a few more extra scenes and add-ons to make it more delightful. But overall, it is a great escape even in today's world. Where the love and admiration and hopes of others are so well divided.Overall, The Perfect Game wasn't a bad film, but not really gripping as a independent film. Still if you've been a avid fan of classic baseball movies like Field Of Dreams, The Sandlot and The Bad News Bears, than give The Perfect Game a try. It is a good film, and definitely a joyful guilty pleasure to watch than all those watered-down films that have came out recently. Hopefully, there can be a better sports film down the road that can be worthy of a home run. But The Perfect Game, will have to do in the meantime.Price: BExtras: C+Mastering: B-Story: B-Overall: B-",4,"Strike 3, You're Out!!",1315872000,"09 13, 2011",2011,2499,"['days', 'honestly', 'very', 'hard', 'find', 'movies', 'team', 'spirit', 'Especially', 'sports', 'films', 'where', 'more', 'winning', 'passion', 'team', 'are', 'exceptions', 'where', 'movie', 'film', 'do', 'have', 'case', 'Perfect', 'Game', 'story', 'Monterey', 'Mexico', 'team', 'make', 'Little', 'League', 'World', 'Series', 'back', '1957', 'idea', 'film', 'was', 'perplexing', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'saw', 'team', 'was', 'team', 'little', 'kids', 'had', 'more', 'passion', 'other', 'faith', 'god', 'joy', 'game', 'winning', 'way', 'so', 'many', 'peoples', 'hearts', 'case', 'Perfect', 'Game', 'film', 'worthy', 'classic', 'baseball', 'films', 'past', 'well', 'yes', 'no.The', 'Perfect', 'Game', 'tale', 'young', 'washed-up', 'baseball', 'player', 'named', 'Cesar', 'whom', 'had', 'desires', 'wanting', 'play', 'St.', 'Louis', 'Cardinals', 'feels', 'first', 'bit', 'destroyed', 'not', 'making', 'dream', 'come', 'alive', 'bunch', 'little', 'kids', 'whom', 'had', 'loved', 'American', 'baseball', 'had', 'dreams', 'wanting', 'make', 'big', 'heroes', 'Down', 'luck', 'Cesar', 'young', 'Mexican', 'misfits', 'gimmick', 'sees', 'real', 'potentials', 'Following', 'heart', 'deep', 'desire', 'winning', 'team', 'American', 'Little', 'League', 'baseball', 'games', 'Mexican', 'team', 'plays', 'way', 'championships', '1957', 'Little', 'League', 'World', 'Series', 'bringing', '2', 'countries', 'together', 'time', 'where', 'America', 'was', 'racially', 'divided', 'African-Americans', 'Spanish-Americans', 'as', 'well', 'deep', 'Southern', 'U.S.A', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'honestly', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'bit', 'better', 'storytelling', 'actors', 'Also', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'few', 'more', 'extra', 'scenes', 'add-ons', 'make', 'more', 'delightful', 'overall', 'great', 'escape', 'even', 'today', 'world', 'Where', 'love', 'admiration', 'hopes', 'others', 'are', 'so', 'well', 'divided.Overall', 'Perfect', 'Game', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'gripping', 'independent', 'film', 'Still', ""'ve"", 'been', 'avid', 'fan', 'classic', 'baseball', 'movies', 'Field', 'Dreams', 'Sandlot', 'Bad', 'News', 'Bears', 'give', 'Perfect', 'Game', 'try', 'good', 'film', 'definitely', 'joyful', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'watered-down', 'films', 'have', 'came', 'out', 'recently', 'Hopefully', 'can', 'be', 'better', 'sports', 'film', 'road', 'can', 'be', 'worthy', 'home', 'run', 'Perfect', 'Game', 'will', 'have', 'do', 'meantime.Price', 'BExtras', 'C+Mastering', 'B-Story', 'B-Overall', 'B-']",N/A

El-Hewie""","[6, 8]","Despite my utter ignorance with baseball, The Perfect Game was the same game that I experienced in the same era, but on the other side of the oceans.  Here, the movie narrates the lives of the poor and religious people of Mexico, the materialistic and racist Southern America of the 1950's, and the business atmosphere of commercial sport. The Perfect Game is a great lesson on how the simple and sensible thoughts of few men of God triumphed over the rigid and blind prejudices of the misinformed masses. The blossoming flowers of bright and energetic kids in the poverty-stricken Mexico inspired the local priest to organize their activities until they built their own modest team.  They were fortunate to have a spiritual leader and a returned one of their own with experience in Baseball.The impoverished and deprived kids not only could they master baseball better and faster than the spoiled kids of the neighboring America, but they also matured on social and emotional issues far beyond those raised in North America. The movie balanced the fast pace of learning of the illiterate and impoverished kids of a demanding sport together with early maturity of relating to adults.  Every good deed made by the volunteer coach to help those desperate kids to learn and compete in sport was paid back instantaneously by their earnest plots to save his romantic future with his sweetheart Maria.The choice of characters was also impressive.  All the white southern and racist characters sounded backward, obese, mean, and out of touch with modernity. Excelling in baseball happened to be only a distraction of those prejudice stricken Southerns to see the bright side of people different from them. The Mexican kids refused to play unless a priest prayed with them before the game, refused to play during the midday siesta, and never comprehended why the Americans discriminated against colored people or why they threw money in bonds when making wishes.  Instead, the impoverished Mexican kids went to the lonely segregated black boy and gave him company, gathered the coins from the bottom of water fountains and telegrammed Maria to come and watch her distracted lover and their volunteered coach.The young kids with untainted minds were not the only underdogs in their pursuit of their dreams to fame and wealth.  They were given few but crucial spiritual push by local good-hearted people.  Ironically, the same superficial skin color that fueled racial discrimination in the era of segregation also fueled the sports fans and sponsors with the success of the Mexican kids in Baseball.  Neither character nor God's given right to equality mattered.  The hotel's cashier's character was also very impressive.  Here, a white man with apparent mental retardation asks the Mexican kids to walk half a mile to use the restrooms for the colored people.  To the contrast, a white waitress with good  heart refused to charge the Mexican kids for the food they consumed and instead chose to double charge her own folks to make up for her hospitality.The movie's great thoughts could be summed up in few words: we are all God's children, hard work makes wishes come true, and big dreams could be reached with plenty of compromises and perseverance.",5,Big thoughts with little means.,1271548800,"04 18, 2010",2010,3243,"['utter', 'ignorance', 'baseball', 'Perfect', 'Game', 'was', 'same', 'game', 'experienced', 'same', 'era', 'other', 'side', 'oceans', 'Here', 'movie', 'lives', 'poor', 'religious', 'people', 'Mexico', 'materialistic', 'racist', 'Southern', 'America', '1950', 'business', 'atmosphere', 'commercial', 'sport', 'Perfect', 'Game', 'great', 'lesson', 'how', 'simple', 'sensible', 'thoughts', 'few', 'men', 'God', 'triumphed', 'rigid', 'blind', 'prejudices', 'misinformed', 'masses', 'blossoming', 'flowers', 'bright', 'energetic', 'kids', 'poverty-stricken', 'Mexico', 'inspired', 'local', 'priest', 'organize', 'activities', 'built', 'own', 'modest', 'team', 'were', 'fortunate', 'have', 'spiritual', 'leader', 'returned', 'one', 'own', 'experience', 'Baseball.The', 'impoverished', 'deprived', 'kids', 'not', 'only', 'could', 'master', 'baseball', 'better', 'faster', 'spoiled', 'kids', 'neighboring', 'America', 'also', 'matured', 'social', 'emotional', 'issues', 'far', 'raised', 'North', 'America', 'movie', 'balanced', 'fast', 'pace', 'learning', 'illiterate', 'impoverished', 'kids', 'demanding', 'sport', 'together', 'early', 'maturity', 'relating', 'adults', 'good', 'deed', 'made', 'volunteer', 'coach', 'help', 'desperate', 'kids', 'learn', 'compete', 'sport', 'was', 'paid', 'back', 'instantaneously', 'earnest', 'plots', 'save', 'romantic', 'future', 'sweetheart', 'Maria.The', 'choice', 'characters', 'was', 'also', 'impressive', 'white', 'southern', 'racist', 'characters', 'sounded', 'backward', 'obese', 'mean', 'touch', 'modernity', 'Excelling', 'baseball', 'happened', 'be', 'only', 'distraction', 'prejudice', 'stricken', 'Southerns', 'see', 'bright', 'side', 'people', 'different', 'Mexican', 'kids', 'refused', 'play', 'priest', 'prayed', 'game', 'refused', 'play', 'midday', 'siesta', 'never', 'comprehended', 'why', 'Americans', 'discriminated', 'colored', 'people', 'why', 'threw', 'money', 'bonds', 'when', 'making', 'wishes', 'Instead', 'impoverished', 'Mexican', 'kids', 'went', 'lonely', 'segregated', 'black', 'boy', 'gave', 'company', 'gathered', 'coins', 'bottom', 'water', 'fountains', 'telegrammed', 'Maria', 'come', 'watch', 'distracted', 'lover', 'volunteered', 'coach.The', 'young', 'kids', 'untainted', 'minds', 'were', 'not', 'only', 'underdogs', 'pursuit', 'dreams', 'fame', 'wealth', 'were', 'given', 'few', 'crucial', 'spiritual', 'push', 'local', 'good-hearted', 'people', 'Ironically', 'same', 'superficial', 'skin', 'color', 'fueled', 'racial', 'discrimination', 'era', 'segregation', 'also', 'fueled', 'sports', 'fans', 'sponsors', 'success', 'Mexican', 'kids', 'Baseball', 'character', 'God', 'given', 'right', 'equality', 'mattered', 'hotel', 'cashier', 'character', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'impressive', 'Here', 'white', 'man', 'apparent', 'mental', 'retardation', 'Mexican', 'kids', 'walk', 'mile', 'use', 'restrooms', 'colored', 'people', 'contrast', 'white', 'waitress', 'good', 'heart', 'refused', 'charge', 'Mexican', 'kids', 'food', 'consumed', 'instead', 'chose', 'double', 'charge', 'own', 'folks', 'make', 'up', 'hospitality.The', 'movie', 'great', 'thoughts', 'could', 'be', 'summed', 'up', 'few', 'words', 'are', 'God', 'children', 'hard', 'work', 'wishes', 'come', 'true', 'big', 'dreams', 'could', 'be', 'reached', 'plenty', 'compromises', 'perseverance']",N/A

It's a lot more serious in nature than The Sandlot, but it still has the feel good moments that made the Sandlot entertaining.The premise of The Perfect Game is simple. A Mexican youth baseball team wants to play little league baseball. As you can imagine, the themes of racism and coming from behind are quite prevalent. That doesn't necessarily make the movie bad, you just need to be realistic about what you're getting.The movie is rather generic. I doubt I'll remember any of the character's names five years from now unless I see them in something else (not holding my breath). But a lot of baseball movies are like that. There's only so much you can do with sports movies, the fact that they're typically about underdogs didn't necessarily bother me.The Perfect Game is a good movie to watch with your whole family.

I also won't rate the movie as either ""good"" or ""bad"" because that is purely subjective ... my taste in movies is MY taste alone.The reason I'm giving it 5 stars is that I enjoyed it, and it was a pleasant surprise, especially since I would not usually purposely watch a movie about baseball. I like the game but I am not what you would call a fan.Here's what I liked. It's believeable. If it were not based on a true story that would be a compliment enough to the actors, but in this movie they took something true and made it believable.  The settings, whether in rural Monterey, Mexico of the 1950's or the U.S. locations, never left me distracted because they didn't look accurate.  The actors who played the kids never came off overly ""cute"", their acting was spot on.Although there is no doubt the movie delivers an intended ""message"" that message is never ramrodded down the viewer's throat. It's just simply there as true life reality.The only thing I struggled with, and this isn't a negative, is Cheech Marin cast as a priest. Just the thought of that is enough to make most people giggle a little. And he did ham it up a little (he wouldn't be Cheech if he didn't). But I don't think it distracted from the movie, he actually did a good job and some of his facial expressions or little quips kept the movie from being too serious.I've recommended The Perfect Game to friends and I recommend it to you.

Despite what it could have been it is well worth watching. Even though I knew what was going to happen I still rooted for the team and smiled at the outcome.The movie is based on the true story of a Mexican Little League Team's quest to overcome overwhelming odds to win the Little League World Series in 1957.  Those involved with the team are likable characters. Cheech Marin does a superb job as a priest who inspires the team. I liked all the ball players and the manager as well.  Even the ""bad people"", like those who looked down on the team because it was Mexican and poor or a newspaper editor who wanted to pull a female reporter off the story once the team made it to the finals because she was a woman, are not so evil.Yet I wish could have understood the manager a bit more.  He is someone who faced discrimination while working for a major league baseball team the United States, came back to Mexico, became a drunk only to sober up and lead the team.  How he did this is beyond me.  He was a drunk one moment a good coach the next.The manager also is set up with a woman in town by one of the ball players who is a young ladies man.  How this preteen does this is beyond me and why this woman falls for the manager is never fully explained.There is a woman reporter who is forced to cover the team when it was expected to lose.  Her editor wants to take her off the story when the team starts winning. I wish I knew more about her other than she was a woman sports reporter. Her character is not developed well.Lou Gossett Jr. has a brief cameo as Cool Papa Bell, a Negro League ballplayer who never got the chance to play Major League baseball because he was black. He was eventually enshrined in the Baseball Hall of Fame in recognition of his greatness.  I wish more could have been done with his character.Despite this, Cheech Marin does a great job as a priest who inspires the team. His character is developed a bit more complex than the others. There is also a subplot where one young ballplayer is treated badly by his father, only to reconciled at the end of the movie, which is developed pretty well.I love baseball movies.

It's a delightful film with moments of real tenderness and humor. It has many little unexpected moments (""the unexpected plays"" you might say)that catch you by surprise.Cheech Marin, perhaps playing the most respectable character in his career, plays the Monterrey priest who helps to inspire the team. The Catholic faith is thankfully shown respectfully - a real rarity in today's films.But don't think that it's only a film about baseball. It's also about father and son relationships, about lost opportunities, teamwork, redemption, and about racial relations. There's a lot to like in this movie, especially the little touches, like when the team goes to sit with a African-American player from another team, when a waitress covers the team's meal, when the wife of a preacher does the team's laundry, and many others.Louis Gossett, Jr. turns in a surprise role along the way. It's an underdog story - a true David and Goliath story - based on the only team in Little League history to pitch a ""perfect game.""

It is hard to imagine many real-life stories more dramatic, inspiring and compelling than this one, and it would have been better served by a telling minus all the medallion-at-the-last-moment scenes and clich&eacute;s. Also, sometimes the film seems to be telling a story involving Catholic theology, but other times, like the song ""When You Can See Forever"", it seems to be more ""meology"".

1431393,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B004X2TYEY,Todd Smith,"[0, 0]","Based on a true story and set in the small of town of Monterrey, Mexico, during the 1950, a group of kids obsessed with baseball, dream to form a team and play in the Little League World Series. The problem is, that not only don't the kids know how to play, but they don't have a coach or even a field. Until one day, the kids encounter a former St. Louis Cardinals prospect, Carlos Faz (Clifton Collins), who takes on the  nearly impossible task of preparing the kids to play in the tournament. The Perfect Game is very inspirational and the kids are adorable, but the film is severely lacking the usual characteristics of a sports film. It's the kids that make the movie, earning your admiration, while making you laugh and cry at the same time, but as a baseball fan, I expect some kind of sports action to be associated with a film like this. All the on field scenes are turned into montages of kids hitting, catching, and throwing, but there are no specifics or real-time game intensity. It's this seemingly small element, that prevents a good film from becoming a great one. Clifton Collins stars as coach Faz and gives a great performance. Collins is an actor I generally don't like, I find that he doesn't fit into many of his roles, but he really surprises me by being everything these kids needed and more. The lead child star is Jake T. Austin, who is now a nineteen year old heart-throb on the ABC family show, The Fosters. I've never seen him in anything before, but it was amazing to think he was only twelve years old when this film was made, because he was the strongest member of the cast. Austin was emotionally charged and was the kid that I wanted to see succeed the most. The film is presented as a sports movie, about the first international team to play in the Little League World Series Tournament. However, it is less of a sports movie and more of a drama about what the kids had to do just to get there and the hardships they faced once they were there. I was disappointed by the lack of real-time sports action, but impressed by the performance of the young cast and what they had to face during such a racial charged time in American history.",4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - (...) - @tss5078,1400630400,"05 21, 2014",2014,2170,"['Based', 'true', 'story', 'set', 'small', 'town', 'Monterrey', 'Mexico', '1950', 'group', 'kids', 'obsessed', 'baseball', 'dream', 'form', 'team', 'play', 'Little', 'League', 'World', 'Series', 'problem', 'not', 'only', 'do', ""n't"", 'kids', 'know', 'how', 'play', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'coach', 'even', 'field', 'one', 'day', 'kids', 'encounter', 'former', 'St.', 'Louis', 'Cardinals', 'prospect', 'Carlos', 'Faz', 'Clifton', 'Collins', 'who', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'task', 'preparing', 'kids', 'play', 'tournament', 'Perfect', 'Game', 'very', 'inspirational', 'kids', 'are', 'adorable', 'film', 'severely', 'lacking', 'usual', 'characteristics', 'sports', 'film', 'kids', 'make', 'movie', 'earning', 'admiration', 'making', 'laugh', 'cry', 'same', 'time', 'baseball', 'fan', 'expect', 'kind', 'sports', 'action', 'be', 'associated', 'film', 'field', 'scenes', 'are', 'turned', 'montages', 'kids', 'hitting', 'catching', 'throwing', 'are', 'specifics', 'real-time', 'game', 'intensity', 'seemingly', 'small', 'element', 'good', 'film', 'becoming', 'great', 'one', 'Clifton', 'Collins', 'coach', 'Faz', 'great', 'performance', 'Collins', 'actor', 'generally', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'find', ""n't"", 'fit', 'many', 'roles', 'really', 'being', 'everything', 'kids', 'needed', 'more', 'lead', 'child', 'star', 'Jake', 'T.', 'Austin', 'who', 'now', 'nineteen', 'year', 'old', 'heart-throb', 'ABC', 'family', 'show', 'Fosters', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'was', 'amazing', 'think', 'was', 'only', 'twelve', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'was', 'strongest', 'member', 'cast', 'Austin', 'was', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'was', 'kid', 'wanted', 'see', 'succeed', 'most', 'film', 'presented', 'sports', 'movie', 'first', 'international', 'team', 'play', 'Little', 'League', 'World', 'Series', 'Tournament', 'However', 'less', 'sports', 'movie', 'more', 'drama', 'what', 'kids', 'had', 'do', 'just', 'get', 'there', 'hardships', 'faced', 'once', 'were', 'there', 'was', 'disappointed', 'lack', 'real-time', 'sports', 'action', 'impressed', 'performance', 'young', 'cast', 'what', 'had', 'face', 'such', 'racial', 'charged', 'time', 'American', 'history']",N/A
