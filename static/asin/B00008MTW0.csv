The film is worth watching just to see Woodward in this uncharacteristic role.  Paul Newman is less convincing as a WWII veteran (navy pilot) caught between his desire to outperform his cold father in the business arena and his desire for the love that he never received from his harsh father and alcoholic mother--only from the household servants while he was a boy.  Myrna Loy's outstanding performance as Newman's mother, sunk deep in alcoholism, is particularly touching.  The film has a curious static quality, possibly because of its pacing.  Most of the shots are very carefully conceived to convey the underlying message of personal destiny.  In the end, one cannot avoid comparing the fate of Newman's neglected mother with the prospects for his abandoned wife.

I did not see the moral of the film so much concerning the price of success as it being that despite your best efforts, you are often doomed to become your parents. At the beginning of the film, Alfred returns home after the second World War to renounce his father because he has, in Alfred's opinion, ignored his mother while strictly attending to business to the point where his mother has become an adulterous lush. Ten or fifteen years later, Alfred has ignored his own wife while climbing the corporate ladder until his own lonely wife has become an adulterous lush. The only crime of his father's he does not commit is to produce offspring that can be dragged into the mess his life has become. One person with a more warped moral code than either Alfred or Mary seems to be Alfred's boss. While eating lunch he casually informs Alfred of Mary's affair with an old flame. When Alfred reacts by saying that he intends to divorce Mary, his boss warns him against such an action. To Alfred's boss, Mary's behavior isn't a moral failing or a cry for attention - it is an unforgivable breach of etiquette. Overall, the main characters in this film lack redeeming characteristics to the point where the movie almost becomes a film noir soap opera. There are still solid performances by both Newman and Woodward, and it is still worth seeing 47 years after it was made. After all, the idle rich and the mistakes they keep making over and over have not changed that much after nearly half a century.",4,"Despite your best efforts, you often become your parents",1168473600,"01 11, 2007",2007,1560,"['did', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'other', 'reviewers', 'apparently', 'saw', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'moral', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'concerning', 'price', 'success', 'being', 'best', 'efforts', 'are', 'often', 'doomed', 'become', 'parents', 'beginning', 'film', 'Alfred', 'home', 'second', 'World', 'War', 'renounce', 'father', 'Alfred', 'opinion', 'ignored', 'mother', 'strictly', 'attending', 'business', 'point', 'where', 'mother', 'become', 'adulterous', 'lush', 'Ten', 'fifteen', 'years', 'later', 'Alfred', 'ignored', 'own', 'wife', 'climbing', 'corporate', 'ladder', 'own', 'lonely', 'wife', 'become', 'adulterous', 'lush', 'only', 'crime', 'father', 'not', 'commit', 'produce', 'offspring', 'can', 'be', 'dragged', 'mess', 'life', 'become', 'One', 'person', 'more', 'warped', 'moral', 'code', 'Alfred', 'Mary', 'be', 'Alfred', 'boss', 'eating', 'lunch', 'casually', 'Alfred', 'Mary', 'affair', 'old', 'flame', 'When', 'Alfred', 'saying', 'divorce', 'Mary', 'boss', 'action', 'Alfred', 'boss', 'Mary', 'behavior', ""n't"", 'moral', 'failing', 'cry', 'attention', 'unforgivable', 'breach', 'etiquette', 'Overall', 'main', 'characters', 'film', 'lack', 'redeeming', 'characteristics', 'point', 'where', 'movie', 'almost', 'film', 'noir', 'soap', 'opera', 'are', 'still', 'solid', 'performances', 'Newman', 'Woodward', 'still', 'worth', 'seeing', '47', 'years', 'was', 'made', 'idle', 'rich', 'mistakes', 'keep', 'making', 'over', 'have', 'not', 'changed', 'much', 'nearly', 'century']",N/A

Paul Newman's Mr Eaton( beautifully played, as is Ms. Woodward's character) shuns NYC for love; it won't play. Hence the underlying tension, the display of virtue by Paul that will never work.

745160,A1G56KHOUOFWDW,B00008MTW0,"Dianne Foster ""Di""","[54, 56]","A view FROM THE TERRACE is what Paul Newman's character David Alfred Eaton has of his future wife Mary (JoAnne Woodward). The screen play was based on a best-selling novel of the same name by John O'Hara. Given it was released in the 1950s when sex on the screen was verboten and not much more explicit in novels (ban a book in Boston), one must appreciate the work it took for Newman and Woodward to give these performances.Like many other teenagers of my generation, I was ""in love"" with Paul Newman. Newman could make female hearts flutter by simply looking at the camera with his big blue eyes.  Many other teens preferred Marlon Brando, his peer and rival for female affection.  I believe these two actors were the Leonardo de Caprio and Brad Pitt of their day, although in the long run, Newman (like de Caprio) has had more staying power and gracefully made the transition to mature roles.In the 1950s, to see a film one had to attend a theater, where the screen was usually covered with a huge velvet curtain.  FTT played at the Center theater in my small town, and I saw the film six times after it was released. I was able to get into the theater for a quarter, and as my allowance was $3, this was no small sacrifice. So, you might say this film was one of my all time favorites.Watching it again almost 50 years later, I wondered how I would react, and of course the passage of time and arrival of many other actors and vast changes in filmmaking have affected the way I view the film and Newman, but I still like him enormously, and this film holds it's own, though the storyline may seem archaic.This film is about infidelity and divorce and the price of success, a story line that may be lost on generations raised in an age of no-fault divorces and dual earner households. Once upon a time, divorce and infidelity were considered absolutely scandalous, and financially disastrous. In fact, if you divorced, your life was ruined. Many couples stayed together and suffered the ignominy of a cheating spouse. FTT was a ground-breaking film because it tackled these issues head-on.The DVD version of the film is well done, and the price reasonable (technicolor and cinemascope production). Do your self a favorite, buy this DVD and add it to the shelf where you keep CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF and other 50's favorites.",5,Excellent oldie.....,1089417600,"07 10, 2004",2004,2325,"['view', 'THE', 'TERRACE', 'what', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'character', 'David', 'Alfred', 'Eaton', 'future', 'wife', 'Mary', 'JoAnne', 'Woodward', 'screen', 'play', 'was', 'based', 'best-selling', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'John', ""O'Hara"", 'Given', 'was', 'released', '1950s', 'when', 'sex', 'screen', 'was', 'verboten', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'explicit', 'novels', 'ban', 'book', 'Boston', 'one', 'must', 'appreciate', 'work', 'took', 'Newman', 'Woodward', 'give', 'many', 'other', 'teenagers', 'generation', 'was', 'love', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'Newman', 'could', 'make', 'female', 'hearts', 'flutter', 'simply', 'looking', 'camera', 'big', 'blue', 'eyes', 'Many', 'other', 'teens', 'preferred', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'peer', 'rival', 'female', 'affection', 'believe', 'two', 'actors', 'were', 'Leonardo', 'de', 'Caprio', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'day', 'long', 'run', 'Newman', 'de', 'Caprio', 'had', 'more', 'staying', 'power', 'gracefully', 'made', 'transition', 'mature', 'roles.In', '1950s', 'see', 'film', 'one', 'had', 'attend', 'theater', 'where', 'screen', 'was', 'usually', 'covered', 'huge', 'velvet', 'curtain', 'FTT', 'played', 'Center', 'theater', 'small', 'town', 'saw', 'film', 'six', 'times', 'was', 'released', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'theater', 'quarter', 'allowance', 'was', '3', 'was', 'small', 'sacrifice', 'So', 'might', 'say', 'film', 'was', 'one', 'time', 'favorites.Watching', 'again', 'almost', '50', 'years', 'later', 'wondered', 'how', 'would', 'react', 'course', 'passage', 'time', 'arrival', 'many', 'other', 'actors', 'vast', 'changes', 'filmmaking', 'have', 'affected', 'way', 'view', 'film', 'Newman', 'still', 'enormously', 'film', 'own', 'storyline', 'may', 'seem', 'archaic.This', 'film', 'infidelity', 'divorce', 'price', 'success', 'story', 'line', 'may', 'be', 'lost', 'generations', 'raised', 'age', 'no-fault', 'divorces', 'dual', 'earner', 'households', 'Once', 'time', 'divorce', 'infidelity', 'were', 'considered', 'absolutely', 'scandalous', 'financially', 'disastrous', 'fact', 'divorced', 'life', 'was', 'ruined', 'Many', 'couples', 'stayed', 'together', 'suffered', 'ignominy', 'cheating', 'spouse', 'FTT', 'was', 'ground-breaking', 'film', 'tackled', 'issues', 'head-on.The', 'DVD', 'version', 'film', 'well', 'done', 'price', 'reasonable', 'technicolor', 'cinemascope', 'production', 'Do', 'self', 'favorite', 'buy', 'DVD', 'add', 'shelf', 'where', 'keep', 'CAT', 'ON', 'A', 'HOT', 'TIN', 'ROOF', 'other', '50', 'favorites']",N/A

Excellent direction, screenplay, score, and acting by Paul Newman, Joanne Woodward (in a wonderful role), Ina Balin, Leon Ames, Myrna Loy, Patrick O'Neal, and Felix Aylmer.

The theme of &#34;what is success&#34; is just as relevant now as it was then. For me, the actors of today pale in comparison with Newman and Woodward. The camera loves Newman.

745175,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B00008MTW0,Linda Linguvic,"[4, 4]","This film was produced in 1960 and set in the same time period. And this is the REAL 1960, not the idealized version in shows like Mad Men.  The theme is real, not influenced by the woman's movement for equality and the makeup feels right, not a caricature.  Yes, it was only men in the boardrooms of power with  the lust for financial success dominant.  The story and the actors were reflective of their life and times.That said, all the actors do outstanding acting jobs, being true to their time and place in history.  Paul Newman is just back from WWII.  His mother, played by Myrna Loy"" is an alcoholic.  His father is unfeeling towards Newman and has only loved his other son who had died at the age of 12.  Newman is angry, lonely and determined to do well in life.  As a young man about town in New York, he romances Joanne Woodward, a society girl with hair bleached so blonde that it looks silver.  She has a boyfriend at the time but Newman beats him out to win Woodward's hand.  However, through the years, she keeps an affair going with this former boyfriend.  Supposedly this is because Newman is working so hard in his Wall Street business that he has no time for her.  Seen through modern eyes, however, Woodward has no other choices in life - no job, no children, no appreciation for her husband.  She's also been sheltered all her life and brought up with money, beautiful clothes and no feelings except enjoying herself.  Naturally, Newman falls in love with another woman played by Ina Balin a virginal type from a small town in West Virginia who is completely smitten by him.  Naturally there is conflict and how this all turns out is a satisfactory conclusion.I enjoyed the film, thought the acting was good, the script fast paced and interesting.  But most of all I liked the period details of all those cigarettes, alcohol, a drive-in theater, lots of parties.

745178,A3O9X6AUXHNTHN,B00008MTW0,"Maxwell Casey ""Max""","[0, 0]","This is one of my all-time favorites of Paul Newman (Alfred Eaton) and Joanne Woodward (Mary St. John). They play off each other magnificantly, she the upper crust, wealthy, spoiled socialite, he the forgotten son of a steel mill owner with a desire to prove his worth in money and business success because his father deprived him of self-worth and love. Newman does a great job early in the movie of communicating the pain of knowing his father loved his brother most and never really loved him. He was driven to prove he didn't need his father, he would show him he was worth something, his goal was to achieve great business success, be richer and more successful than his father ever was.  The MacHardie character (head of the Wall Street firm of J.D. MacHardie) portrays the businessman who has put the success and the reputation of the company ahead of family, personal relationships, and success in one's personal life.  Nothing matters more than the company--it's first, last, and foremost always, all else is to be sacrificed for the sake of the company.  His comment about marriage to an adulterous wife is less the sin than divorce because divorce breaks a contract and breaking a contract is condemnation on the reputation of the company.  As MacHardie said, adultery is just between man and wife and God, this so exemplifies the all-encompassing appetite of big business--globbling up people and lives and using them up, nothing matters more than the company, lives are lived based on what's best for the company.The tenderness between Newman (Alfred now David to Natalie) and Balin (Natalie)is touching, it's love at first sight for her, even though she denies it.  Alfred sees the warmth and tenderness of a loving close family with Natalie and her father/mother; he has never experienced this family bond--not in his own family or in his marraige.  The relationship is wrong, but Natalie pursues Alfred without the sleazy feeling of an illicit affair. Ina Balin plays this role perfectly--innocent, caring, loving and kind, there is an instant bond between Alfred and Natalie and you feel the pain of their decision to end it but the relationship haunts them both.Mary meantime has decided her socialite, partying life is just what she likes, and she flouts her affair with her old flame and fiancee in Alfred's face. She's confident Alfred will never give up his career and compromise his business success. Mary and Alfred grow completely apart and Alfred has to choose between his goal of bettering his father or giving it all up for the love of his life.The music from Elmer Bernstein is beautiful for this movie.  And Joanne (Mary) is dressed to the nines--such a contrast in her beautiful dress designs and the simple clothing of Natalie, all pointing to Alfred's stark choice between his high-flying career and love.There is something special about this movie over others Newman and Woodward have done (however, I do like The Long Hot Summer very much, lots of real romance between Newman and Woodward in that one since they were married just after that movie's release).  Newman has other great movies, such as Cat On A Hot Tin Roof and The Verdict, but I have watched From The Terrace many times and enjoy it each time. It's a good one to add to a Newman/Woodward collection.",5,"Wanted it all, when he got it, the price was too high and the reward empty.",1213920000,"06 20, 2008",2008,3299,"['one', 'all-time', 'favorites', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'Alfred', 'Eaton', 'Joanne', 'Woodward', 'Mary', 'St.', 'John', 'play', 'off', 'other', 'magnificantly', 'upper', 'crust', 'wealthy', 'spoiled', 'socialite', 'forgotten', 'son', 'steel', 'mill', 'owner', 'desire', 'prove', 'worth', 'money', 'business', 'success', 'father', 'deprived', 'self-worth', 'love', 'Newman', 'great', 'job', 'early', 'movie', 'communicating', 'pain', 'knowing', 'father', 'loved', 'brother', 'most', 'never', 'really', 'loved', 'was', 'driven', 'prove', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'father', 'would', 'show', 'was', 'worth', 'something', 'goal', 'was', 'achieve', 'great', 'business', 'success', 'be', 'richer', 'more', 'successful', 'father', 'ever', 'was', 'MacHardie', 'character', 'head', 'Wall', 'Street', 'firm', 'J.D', 'MacHardie', 'businessman', 'who', 'put', 'success', 'reputation', 'company', 'ahead', 'family', 'personal', 'relationships', 'success', 'one', 'personal', 'life', 'Nothing', 'matters', 'more', 'company', 'first', 'last', 'foremost', 'always', 'else', 'be', 'sacrificed', 'sake', 'company', 'comment', 'about', 'marriage', 'adulterous', 'wife', 'less', 'sin', 'divorce', 'divorce', 'breaks', 'contract', 'breaking', 'contract', 'condemnation', 'reputation', 'company', 'MacHardie', 'said', 'adultery', 'just', 'man', 'wife', 'God', 'so', 'all-encompassing', 'appetite', 'big', 'business', 'globbling', 'up', 'people', 'lives', 'using', 'up', 'nothing', 'matters', 'more', 'company', 'lives', 'are', 'lived', 'based', 'what', 'best', 'company.The', 'tenderness', 'Newman', 'Alfred', 'now', 'David', 'Natalie', 'Balin', 'Natalie', 'touching', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'even', 'Alfred', 'warmth', 'tenderness', 'loving', 'close', 'family', 'Natalie', 'father/mother', 'never', 'experienced', 'family', 'bond', 'not', 'own', 'family', 'marraige', 'relationship', 'wrong', 'Natalie', 'pursues', 'Alfred', 'sleazy', 'feeling', 'illicit', 'affair', 'Ina', 'Balin', 'role', 'perfectly', 'innocent', 'caring', 'loving', 'kind', 'instant', 'bond', 'Alfred', 'Natalie', 'feel', 'pain', 'decision', 'end', 'relationship', 'both.Mary', 'meantime', 'decided', 'socialite', 'partying', 'life', 'just', 'what', 'affair', 'old', 'flame', 'fiancee', 'Alfred', 'face', 'confident', 'Alfred', 'will', 'never', 'give', 'up', 'career', 'compromise', 'business', 'success', 'Mary', 'Alfred', 'grow', 'completely', 'apart', 'Alfred', 'choose', 'goal', 'bettering', 'father', 'giving', 'up', 'love', 'life.The', 'music', 'Elmer', 'Bernstein', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'Joanne', 'Mary', 'dressed', 'nines', 'contrast', 'beautiful', 'dress', 'designs', 'simple', 'clothing', 'Natalie', 'pointing', 'Alfred', 'stark', 'choice', 'high-flying', 'career', 'something', 'special', 'movie', 'others', 'Newman', 'Woodward', 'have', 'done', 'however', 'do', 'Long', 'Hot', 'Summer', 'very', 'much', 'lots', 'real', 'romance', 'Newman', 'Woodward', 'one', 'were', 'married', 'just', 'movie', 'release', 'Newman', 'other', 'great', 'movies', 'such', 'Cat', 'A', 'Hot', 'Tin', 'Roof', 'Verdict', 'have', 'watched', 'Terrace', 'many', 'times', 'enjoy', 'time', 'good', 'one', 'add', 'Newman/Woodward', 'collection']",N/A

(In an inadvertently funny scene, Alfred derisively tiptoes out of her bedroom, while his inebriated mother goes on and on about her troubles...but I guess this is what passes as maternal love in the world of John O'Hara)Alfred sets out for New York City to make his mark on the world and promptly falls in love with Mary St John (Joanne Woodward) much to the dismay of her parents. But then Alfred's father dies (he owns a big factory in Pennsylvania) and the St Johns make an about face and sanction the marriage of Alfred and Mary.Then Alfred saves the life of the grandson of a big-wheel, disgustingly rich Wall Street Broker and Alfred's life turns around. For the Better: who can say?Much is made of the dedicated corporate man who cares only about work, making lots of money, buying beautiful clothes and an even more beautiful apartment while his wife seeks solace elsewhere... versus the man who lives a simple life out in the country with a wife and two kids and a Studebaker...but is happy. In it's empty-headed way,""FTT"" succeeds in making the simple life palatable, if pretty dull. But what man on Earth would choose Ina Balin over Joanne Woodward and a huge (looks like 10,000 square feet to me) apartment in the upper 80's on Fifth Avenue to boot?Newman bluffs his way through the entire movie with his patented steely grimaces and blindingly good looks. Even Woodward, much less all the other men and women in this movie, fade to almost white when they are put into the same frame as Newman.""From The Terrace"" is okay for that rainy day you feel like eating peanut butter out of the jar and quaffing a big magnum (you'll need it, this movie is way over 2 hours long) of good California Sparkling Wine.

Smith ""MGMboy@aol.com""","[20, 22]","A classic film adaptation from one of John O'Hara's massive tomes, Mark Robeson's ""From the Terrace"" hold it's age well and is lots of fun to boot.Producer Director Mark Robson presents to us in the glossy grandeur of 20th Century-Fox the postwar portrait of a young man on the rise who sacrifices love for money, to a point that is.Paul Newman turns in an expertly colored performance as Alfred Newman. His brooding good looks and hard angles are the perfect reflection of young corporate America of the late 40's and 50's. Yet under that cool hard as coal exterior he hides a desire that only emerges toward the end of the film, yet it is there from the first frame of the film fueling his performance.Joanne Woodward as Mary St.John is no less brilliant. Her icy cool old money Mary is just the perfect fortress to entice Newman. She plays the part as if she were born to it and in the end she is left hard, jaded and desperate. She proves once again why she is still one of our best film actresses from the fifties who is still working today.Studio costume designer Travilla should be noted for his wonderful costumes. He was most famous for his designs in the 50's for Marilyn Monroe. Here he presents a stunningly elegant collection of the best looks of the late 50's and early 60's. His designs are rich and restrained and a feast for the eye.The score by the late great Elmer Bernstein is another masterpiece by this musical genius who's work spanned the from ""The Ten Commandments"" to ""Vanilla Sky"". It is a perfect score. Of particular note is the scene between Mary and her old lover at the ice-skating shed and the scene where Alfred rescues a drowning boy.

As good old fashioned ""potboiler"", John O Hara's screen adaptation is not quite as sprawling as say....Edna Ferber's works, but nonetheless is a decent potboiler  in its own right. Alfred (Paul Newman),  discharged from the Navy after WW II is the ambitious, disaffected son of nouveau riche steel mill owner Samuel Eaton, (Leon Ames). Seeking to make his own unique mark in the world he spurns his father's hopes of joining the business and decides his fortune is to be made elsewhere. Along the way, he meets his future blue-blooded trophy wife Mary St. John (Joanne Woodward) and soon discovers her appetites are far in excess even to his own ambitions. Landing a job at a prestigious Wall Street firm in an oblique way that is a potboiler's trademark, Alfred comes under the watchful eye of old money and traditional expectations by J.D. MacHardie (masterfully portrayed by Felix Aylmer). I very much enjoyed all the scenes in which Aylmer's MacHardie was highlighted and I can almost smell the stodginess of old money, ritual table manners, wood paneled walls, cigars, and brandy that were part of his ultra-conservative environment. Soon enough, while on a trip to scout business opportunities, Alfred meets Natalie (Ina Balin), the unattached daughter of a wealthy coal mine owner. Knowing full well of his marital status, she consents, even encourages his attention and unfaithfulness. Balin manages to pull this off with a naive sweetness without ever seeming cheap or trashy.  Infidelity is a major theme in this work and I'm sure its frank discussion must have sparked many a controversy when this film was released very early in 1960. Veteran actress Myrna Loy was given near top billing as Alfred's alcoholic and unfaithful mother, yet her on-screen performance was limited to the first reel of this nearly 2 1/2 hour film. I  enjoyed the  brief on screen appearance of young Barbara Eden as a flirtatious socialite. Patrick O'Neal was perfectly cast as the smarmy Dr. Jim Roper, the illicit lover of Mary St. John. Over his long acting career, Paul Newman has delivered solid performances again and again. This is one of his lesser known works but serves as a fine example of why he was so popular with the audience as a silver screen heartthrob. Watching this film today and being mindful of his lasting marriage to Joanne Woodward just serves to make this movie all the more compelling to me.
