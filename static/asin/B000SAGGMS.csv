The dialog is sparse, the acting superb and the plot quirky. Those who don't get kinetic humour (not slapstick - think more of the actors' backgrounds in circus clowning) will be left out in the cold. I found the back cover to be a mild spoiler. My following description is more sparse but you might enjoy this gem more if you don't read anything past the following period. No not this one. The one further to the right of the previous one. Well, don't say I didn't warn you.

1085805,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000SAGGMS,Roland E. Zwick,"[4, 4]","The Belgian comedy, ""L'Iceberg,"" is such a head-scratching little oddity that it is virtually impossible to describe it for anyone who hasn`t already seen it.  It's a highly stylized tale of a young restaurant manager who decides to break away from her stultifying and humdrum existence after she inadvertently locks herself in a freezer overnight - only to discover, once she gets out, that her husband and their two carbon-copy young children have failed to notice her absence.  Realizing her utter insignificance to those around her, Fiona strikes out on her own, abandoning her job and staying away from home for long stretches of time - eventually setting out to sea with a mysterious deaf/mute sailor she meets along the way.Utilizing concepts straight out of the Theater of the Absurd, ""L'Iceberg"" pokes fun at the sterility of modern life, as Fiona finally breaks free of the bonds of domesticity and goes on a quest for love and adventure.  Directors Dominique Abel and Fiona Gordon (who play the husband and wife in the film) have composed their film almost entirely of straight-on block shots, perfect for emphasizing the surreal spareness of the drama and setting.  The lanky, bug-eyed Gordon, who looks for all the world like a cross between Frances McDormand and a stringy-haired Olive Oyl, plays Fiona with a mouth-breathing, deadpanned seriousness that enhances our empathy for the character and heightens the satirical nature of the piece.Original in concept and bold in execution, ""L'Iceberg"" is irrepressibly imaginative and visually inventive in its cockeyed portrayal of the world around us.",4,one-of-a-kind surrealisic comedy,1213747200,"06 18, 2008",2008,1612,"['Belgian', 'comedy', ""L'Iceberg"", 'head-scratching', 'little', 'oddity', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'describe', 'anyone', 'who', 't', 'already', 'seen', 'highly', 'stylized', 'tale', 'young', 'restaurant', 'manager', 'who', 'break', 'away', 'stultifying', 'humdrum', 'existence', 'inadvertently', 'freezer', 'overnight', 'only', 'discover', 'once', 'out', 'husband', 'two', 'carbon-copy', 'young', 'children', 'have', 'failed', 'notice', 'absence', 'Realizing', 'utter', 'insignificance', 'Fiona', 'out', 'own', 'abandoning', 'job', 'staying', 'away', 'home', 'long', 'stretches', 'time', 'eventually', 'setting', 'out', 'sea', 'mysterious', 'deaf/mute', 'sailor', 'way.Utilizing', 'concepts', 'straight', 'Theater', 'Absurd', ""L'Iceberg"", 'fun', 'sterility', 'modern', 'life', 'Fiona', 'finally', 'free', 'bonds', 'domesticity', 'quest', 'love', 'adventure', 'Directors', 'Dominique', 'Abel', 'Fiona', 'Gordon', 'who', 'play', 'husband', 'wife', 'film', 'have', 'composed', 'film', 'almost', 'entirely', 'straight-on', 'block', 'shots', 'perfect', 'emphasizing', 'surreal', 'spareness', 'drama', 'setting', 'lanky', 'bug-eyed', 'Gordon', 'who', 'world', 'cross', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'stringy-haired', 'Olive', 'Oyl', 'Fiona', 'mouth-breathing', 'deadpanned', 'seriousness', 'empathy', 'character', 'satirical', 'nature', 'piece.Original', 'concept', 'bold', 'execution', ""L'Iceberg"", 'irrepressibly', 'imaginative', 'visually', 'inventive', 'cockeyed', 'portrayal', 'world']",L' Iceberg
