However, it wish there was more to this DVD like behind the scenes work, newscast of the election and other items that happened before the speech was made. That is where the real excitement lies...in the details. I gave this DVD a 3-star because although the speech is recorded, more content could have been added along with the news articles read by its writers.",3,Needs more content...,1401667200,"06 2, 2014",2014,447,"['Covering', 'speech', 'moment', 'seeing', 'reaction', 'crowd', 'was', 'magical', 'However', 'wish', 'was', 'more', 'DVD', 'scenes', 'work', 'newscast', 'election', 'other', 'items', 'happened', 'speech', 'was', 'made', 'where', 'real', 'excitement', 'lies', 'details', 'gave', 'DVD', '3-star', 'speech', 'recorded', 'more', 'content', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'added', 'news', 'articles', 'read', 'writers']",N/A

As another reviewer said, I was very disappointed that they did not include the network election coverage (and found the handheld video shots of a few random people quite a letdown).  I was let down by this - not worth the money, ultimately.Fortunately, Obama is President, so who cares about a lame dvd??",2,Thrilling night - Lame dvd!,1236643200,"03 10, 2009",2009,442,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'experienced', 'anything', 'moving', 'thrilling', 'Election', 'Night', '2008', 'sadly', 'DVD', 'did', 'not', 'come', 'close', 'capturing', 'reviewer', 'said', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'did', 'not', 'include', 'network', 'election', 'coverage', 'found', 'handheld', 'video', 'shots', 'few', 'random', 'people', 'quite', 'letdown', 'was', 'let', 'down', 'not', 'money', 'ultimately.Fortunately', 'Obama', 'President', 'who', 'lame', 'dvd']",N/A

Watching the returns and for the first couple of states were called for McCain I started to get depressed but within mere minutes other states started calling Obama. After 8 horrible years to see history being made, not only did I yell and scream ""Thank God we are back in control"" and by the way scaring my dogs with my excitement. I cried as he went on stage with Biden and both of their families, tears of happiness were falling. I supported Hillary in the primary but quickly got on board Obama's immediately and without hesitation, for I am a Democrat and will only vote my party. I still cry when I watch this and look forward in owning a bit of history. When I seen the tears flowing from Reverened Jackson and Oprah among us all I realized the significance and why we were crying. The significance of a black man winning the highest office, Obama unites not divides. His color isn't an issue to me, I'm fortunate I was brought up to respect everyone not just my race. This was an unbelievable night, amazing, historic. He is our President, he has a vision, he cares about others, and he's intelligent and articulate and very awe-inspiring. I'm so happy that the black community is fully represented, from Rosa Parks's historic action on a bus, to slavery. We are one! We are ONE.
