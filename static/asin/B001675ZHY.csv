1152512,AT57B36BHDQ00,B001675ZHY,Big Mike,"[14, 15]","I first saw The Real McCoys as a very small child during the original network airings in the early 1960's and then in weekday morning network repeats. Many years passed before I saw it again. I am now hooked and don't know why the show has been so seldom seen for many years. Maybe the airings on The Nashville Network created enough interest in releasing the show on DVD to make it happen. With the first three seasons already out and the other three promised this is just great. Even if the shows are missing some original material, I would much rather have them than not see the show at all. The legendary Walter Brennan still holds the record for most Best Supporting Actor Oscars won - three. Apparently, when asked to be in The Real McCoys he was reported to have said ""But, I'm no comic!!"". Another reviewer compared Redd Foxx and Don Knotts to Walter Brennan. While they are entitled to their opinion, as much as I truly loved Don Knotts, especially as Barney Fife, he nor Redd Foxx (does anyone really remember anything he did other than play Fred Sanford?), nor the other actor this reviewer mentioned, whose name I did not recognize, can even be remotely rated alongside an actor of Walter Brennan's stature and magnitude. He is widely rated by many noted film critics as possibly the greatest character actor of all time!! He was also a quite remarkable man in real life. I would love to read a complete biography of his life if one is ever written. I recommend that anyone interested should read up on him on the Net. I was amazed at his life story. Richard Crenna was very good as Luke and had a long and distinguished career after The Real McCoys. But my personal favorite was the lovely and talented Kathleen (""Kathy"") Nolan as Kate. She was really the heart, soul and conscience of the show. It was such a pity that she left the series after the fifth season and was written out altogether for the ill-conceived and advised sixth and final season. Although she would make many guest appearances on many other shows in the years to follow, she would never create or make a character so completely her own again, as she did Kate McCoy. Certainly for this reason, they were very wise not to simply cast another actress as Kate, as Bewitched foolishly and poorly did several years later on with the character of Darrin Stephens. Lydia Reed was good as Hassie and Michael Winkelman was good as Little Luke. Tony Martinez was also excellent as the farmhand who became a member of the family, Pepino. The supporting cast, especially Andy Clyde and Madge Blake were also excellent. It was usually Kate and Pepino who tempered the schemes and shenanigans of Grandpa and Luke and brought them to their senses, steering them the right way. It would be fantastic to have complete episodes, but I just hope they do release at least seasons four and five. Season six to me is like The Andy Griffith Show without Barney Fife. I really don't even want to see it. It was just not the same show at all without Kate. Actually more sad without Kate and I also believe both Hassie and Little Luke were also dropped before the show ended. I also read that even Walter Brennan did not appear in the last thirteen episodes of the last season. Apparently those episodes featured Luke and Pepino. The predominate theme of the sixth season was Grandpa trying to play matchmaker for the newly widowed Luke. Not for me thank you very much, actually quite depressing more than anything else. But I definitely want seasons four and five to go along with the first three, which I already have. The Real McCoys was the first of the ""rural"" shows. But to me it had something that maybe only The Andy Griffith Show had from time-to-time and that is that it touched on more believability and realism than other shows of the day. I think The Real McCoys was more than just a run-of-the-mill rural sitcom. The more episodes of the series I see convinces me even more of that. The show also had warmth, values and a heart. Something you sadly certainly cannot say about any of the modern shows.",5,"The Real McCoys - first, best, most realistic and believable of the rural shows",1223078400,"10 4, 2008",2008,4072,"['first', 'saw', 'Real', 'McCoys', 'very', 'small', 'child', 'original', 'network', 'airings', 'early', '1960', 'then', 'weekday', 'morning', 'network', 'repeats', 'Many', 'years', 'passed', 'saw', 'again', 'am', 'now', 'hooked', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'show', 'been', 'so', 'seldom', 'seen', 'many', 'years', 'Maybe', 'airings', 'Nashville', 'Network', 'created', 'enough', 'interest', 'releasing', 'show', 'DVD', 'make', 'happen', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'already', 'out', 'other', 'three', 'promised', 'just', 'great', 'Even', 'shows', 'are', 'missing', 'original', 'material', 'would', 'much', 'rather', 'have', 'not', 'see', 'show', 'legendary', 'Walter', 'Brennan', 'still', 'record', 'most', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Oscars', 'won', 'three', 'Apparently', 'when', 'asked', 'be', 'Real', 'McCoys', 'was', 'reported', 'have', 'said', ""'m"", 'comic', 'reviewer', 'compared', 'Redd', 'Foxx', 'Don', 'Knotts', 'Walter', 'Brennan', 'are', 'entitled', 'opinion', 'as', 'much', 'truly', 'loved', 'Don', 'Knotts', 'especially', 'Barney', 'Fife', 'Redd', 'Foxx', 'anyone', 'really', 'remember', 'anything', 'did', 'other', 'play', 'Fred', 'Sanford', 'other', 'actor', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'name', 'did', 'not', 'recognize', 'can', 'even', 'be', 'remotely', 'rated', 'actor', 'Walter', 'Brennan', 'stature', 'magnitude', 'widely', 'rated', 'many', 'noted', 'film', 'critics', 'possibly', 'greatest', 'character', 'actor', 'time', 'was', 'also', 'quite', 'remarkable', 'man', 'real', 'life', 'would', 'love', 'read', 'complete', 'biography', 'life', 'one', 'ever', 'written', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'interested', 'should', 'read', 'up', 'Net', 'was', 'amazed', 'life', 'story', 'Richard', 'Crenna', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'Luke', 'had', 'long', 'distinguished', 'career', 'Real', 'McCoys', 'personal', 'favorite', 'was', 'lovely', 'talented', 'Kathleen', 'Kathy', 'Nolan', 'Kate', 'was', 'really', 'heart', 'soul', 'conscience', 'show', 'was', 'such', 'pity', 'left', 'series', 'fifth', 'season', 'was', 'written', 'out', 'altogether', 'ill-conceived', 'advised', 'sixth', 'final', 'season', 'would', 'make', 'many', 'guest', 'appearances', 'many', 'other', 'shows', 'years', 'follow', 'would', 'never', 'create', 'make', 'character', 'so', 'completely', 'own', 'again', 'did', 'Kate', 'McCoy', 'Certainly', 'reason', 'were', 'very', 'wise', 'not', 'simply', 'cast', 'actress', 'Kate', 'Bewitched', 'foolishly', 'poorly', 'did', 'several', 'years', 'later', 'character', 'Darrin', 'Stephens', 'Lydia', 'Reed', 'was', 'good', 'Hassie', 'Michael', 'Winkelman', 'was', 'good', 'Little', 'Luke', 'Tony', 'Martinez', 'was', 'also', 'excellent', 'farmhand', 'who', 'became', 'member', 'family', 'Pepino', 'supporting', 'cast', 'especially', 'Andy', 'Clyde', 'Madge', 'Blake', 'were', 'also', 'excellent', 'was', 'usually', 'Kate', 'Pepino', 'who', 'tempered', 'schemes', 'shenanigans', 'Grandpa', 'Luke', 'brought', 'senses', 'steering', 'right', 'way', 'would', 'be', 'fantastic', 'have', 'complete', 'episodes', 'just', 'hope', 'do', 'release', 'least', 'seasons', 'four', 'five', 'Season', 'six', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'Show', 'Barney', 'Fife', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'want', 'see', 'was', 'just', 'not', 'same', 'show', 'Kate', 'Actually', 'more', 'sad', 'Kate', 'also', 'believe', 'Hassie', 'Little', 'Luke', 'were', 'also', 'dropped', 'show', 'ended', 'also', 'read', 'even', 'Walter', 'Brennan', 'did', 'not', 'appear', 'last', 'thirteen', 'episodes', 'last', 'season', 'Apparently', 'episodes', 'featured', 'Luke', 'Pepino', 'predominate', 'theme', 'sixth', 'season', 'was', 'Grandpa', 'trying', 'play', 'matchmaker', 'newly', 'widowed', 'Luke', 'Not', 'very', 'much', 'actually', 'quite', 'depressing', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'definitely', 'want', 'seasons', 'four', 'five', 'go', 'along', 'first', 'three', 'already', 'have', 'Real', 'McCoys', 'was', 'first', 'rural', 'shows', 'had', 'something', 'maybe', 'only', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'Show', 'had', 'time-to-time', 'touched', 'more', 'believability', 'realism', 'other', 'shows', 'day', 'think', 'Real', 'McCoys', 'was', 'more', 'just', 'run-of-the-mill', 'rural', 'sitcom', 'more', 'episodes', 'series', 'see', 'convinces', 'even', 'more', 'show', 'also', 'had', 'warmth', 'values', 'heart', 'Something', 'sadly', 'certainly', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'modern', 'shows']",The Real McCoys - Season 3
