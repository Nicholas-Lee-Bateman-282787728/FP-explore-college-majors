Now, after seeing it for the first time, I can see why it should've remained unknown.Simply put, it's dreck of the lowest caliber.  I mean this celluloid disaster makes Swept Away look like Titanic.Madonna plays this streetwise trick who falls in love with some thug who thinks he's some sort of Devil worshiper.  She also happens to be a member of a love cult and keeps three particular lovers around (one is transgendered).  Over the course of 60 minutes (don't let the short run time fool you. This movie feels like its The English Patient.) we watch these two lovebirds fall madly in love with one another despite the fact that he pulls a gun on her the moment he meets her.  Then one day, Madonna is attacked and raped.  So she turns to her Anton LeVey wannabe boyfriend and he and his cult of followers find the man responsible and they exact their revenge on him.  In the end, the lovers are reunited and they make deep, passionate love while soaked head to toe in her attackers blood.The sound and picture quality are horrendous.  I swear after ten minutes of having to squint to try and see what was going on, I felt the oncoming of a headache,  The acting is on the level of cheap porn.  And the musical numbers are laugh out loud jokes. ""We will drink the blood that flows/ from his head down to his toes""?  Who wrote this crap?  It's little wonder why Madonna tried to sue the director to keep this movie from being released. It's a real tragedy that she failed and now I sacrificed an hour of my time for having seen it.",1,A Certain Embarrassment For Madonna and Her Fans,1353888000,"11 26, 2012",2012,1718,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'lifelong', 'Madonna', 'fan', '20', 'years', 'now', 'was', 'VH1', 'bio', 'when', 'learned', 'little', 'unknown', 'movie', 'did', 'back', 'became', 'Material', 'Girl', 'Now', 'seeing', 'first', 'time', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'should', ""'ve"", 'remained', 'unknown.Simply', 'put', 'dreck', 'lowest', 'caliber', 'mean', 'celluloid', 'disaster', 'Swept', 'Away', 'look', 'Titanic.Madonna', 'streetwise', 'trick', 'who', 'love', 'thug', 'who', 'sort', 'Devil', 'worshiper', 'also', 'be', 'member', 'love', 'cult', 'keeps', 'three', 'particular', 'lovers', 'one', 'transgendered', 'course', '60', 'minutes', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'short', 'run', 'time', 'fool', 'movie', 'English', 'Patient', 'watch', 'two', 'lovebirds', 'fall', 'madly', 'love', 'one', 'fact', 'gun', 'moment', 'Then', 'one', 'day', 'Madonna', 'attacked', 'raped', 'Anton', 'LeVey', 'wannabe', 'boyfriend', 'cult', 'followers', 'find', 'man', 'responsible', 'exact', 'revenge', 'end', 'lovers', 'are', 'reunited', 'make', 'deep', 'passionate', 'love', 'soaked', 'head', 'toe', 'attackers', 'blood.The', 'sound', 'picture', 'quality', 'are', 'horrendous', 'swear', 'ten', 'minutes', 'having', 'squint', 'try', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'felt', 'oncoming', 'headache', 'acting', 'level', 'cheap', 'porn', 'musical', 'numbers', 'are', 'loud', 'jokes', 'will', 'drink', 'blood', 'flows/', 'head', 'down', 'toes', 'Who', 'wrote', 'crap', 'little', 'wonder', 'why', 'Madonna', 'tried', 'sue', 'director', 'keep', 'movie', 'being', 'released', 'real', 'tragedy', 'failed', 'now', 'sacrificed', 'hour', 'time', 'having', 'seen']",Certain Sacrifice

A racist, foul man named Raymond Hall, who Dashiel had a restaurant run-in with earlier in the movie rapes Bruna in a diner restroom.Dashiel promises Bruna he will exact revenge,  so Bruna and her family of lovers catch and kidnap Raymond one day... and this leads us to the films climax, where Hall is murdered in a Satanic sacrificial rock ritual.Madonna unsuccessfully tried to sue to prevent this from being released to the public, but thankfully it came out anyways.  If they ever revive Mystery Science Theater on pay-cable, this would certainly be a ripe movie for them to pick on.Why do I give this two stars?  it's so bad that the badness actually makes it watchable.

It was shot in 1979 but was not released (for obvious reasons) until 1985 after Madonna's superstardom. The actors made up most of the dialogue, and the audience was apparently supposed to make up most of the plot. The cameraman seemed to be a quadriplegic, flailing around randomly, shooting everything except what's going on. The editor must have refused to cut a single second of the pointless and excruciatingly dull footage. Our only salvation from the hideous acting is that most of the dialogue was obscured by background noise.
