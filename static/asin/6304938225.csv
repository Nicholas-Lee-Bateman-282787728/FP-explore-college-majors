The U.N.-led convoy is halted by a band of Serbian roustabouts dressed in their military togs. One, a bearded smart aleck enters the hushed vehicle and proceeds to claim all Muslim children, whose names he reads from a list. As the wailing subsides and the kidnappers drive away carrying the doomed innocents, the unthinkable happens. You are moved.That's Welcome to Sarajevo in a nutshell-heartbreaking, sincere, and boldly partisan. And smartly, director Michael Winterbottom chooses a gonzo, pseudo-journalistic style that, like those living in the city, has us dodging mortar fire and rushing through the streets to witness the genocide.The movie's about putting us on the front line and making us swallow the absurdity and chaos of a country in turmoil.",4,War is Still Hell,1187654400,"08 21, 2007",2007,929,"['are', 'few', 'more', 'devastating', 'images', 'busload', 'children', 'being', 'shuttled', 'safety', 'bombed-out', 'neigborhoods', 'Sarajevo', 'former', 'Yugoslavia', 'U.N.-led', 'convoy', 'halted', 'band', 'Serbian', 'roustabouts', 'dressed', 'military', 'togs', 'One', 'bearded', 'smart', 'aleck', 'hushed', 'vehicle', 'proceeds', 'claim', 'Muslim', 'children', 'names', 'list', 'wailing', 'subsides', 'kidnappers', 'drive', 'away', 'carrying', 'doomed', 'innocents', 'unthinkable', 'happens', 'are', 'moved.That', 'Welcome', 'Sarajevo', 'nutshell-heartbreaking', 'sincere', 'boldly', 'partisan', 'smartly', 'director', 'Michael', 'Winterbottom', 'gonzo', 'pseudo-journalistic', 'style', 'living', 'city', 'dodging', 'mortar', 'fire', 'rushing', 'streets', 'witness', 'genocide.The', 'movie', 'putting', 'front', 'line', 'making', 'swallow', 'absurdity', 'chaos', 'country', 'turmoil']",Welcome to Sarajevo VHS

440608,AT6CZDCP4TRGA,6304938225,Eduarrdo Nietzsche,"[4, 10]","As someone who followed the carnage in the former Yugoslavia with great morbid fascination during most of the 1990s, I found much of this film quite accurate.There is a long and bloody history between the ethnic groups of Yugoslavia of which none are guiltless, but what happened in the early 90s was almost ENTIRELY the doing of the Serb leadership, namely Karazdic and Milosevic who both deserve a special seat in hell.  It was also the fault of the West, namely the West Europeans, that nothing was done until hundreds of thousands had been displaced, killed, and wounded---in particular, the British government was openly sympathetic to the Serbian side, and much of the Western Europeans also were afraid of having another Muslim state at their doorstep (the reason they keep refusing Turkey entry to the EU).  It was also partially Clinton's fault for refusing to go it alone when the Europeans balked, until much too late in the game.  But at least US military power was used for some cause other than oil or imperialism, for a change.""Welcome to Sarajevo"" touches on all these points but very subtly; this is not a Spike Lee soapbox-and-a-megaphone type of movie, nor is it the kind of schmaltzy and posturing Hollywood misery-exploitation movie that I feared when I saw that Woody Harrelson had one of the starring roles.As filmmaking it is competent but hardly stellar---pacing is a bit slow, some dialogue and acting was jarringly subpar (Marisa Tomei was NOT well directed at all), and the plot is fairly predictable and ordinary.  However as history and journalism it is worth watching, this film takes us behind the usual nightly 30 seconds of carnage film footage and humanizes the conflict by showing us not only the physical but also mental and emotional environment that these people endured for so many years.The last scene, of a classical concert outdoors in Sarajevo near the end of hostilities, is simple, direct and beautiful.PS. It is also true however that had what happened in the ex-Yugoslavia happened in some Third-World non-white country (and much worse things DO happen in those countries all the time, e.g. Sudan and Rwanda) it never would've garnered anywhere as much media attention.  And it is also sadly true that had the victims been Christians instead of Muslims, more would've been done much much sooner.",4,"nice window into hell---or one of them, at least.",1118880000,"06 16, 2005",2005,2343,"['someone', 'who', 'followed', 'carnage', 'former', 'Yugoslavia', 'great', 'morbid', 'fascination', 'most', '1990s', 'found', 'much', 'film', 'quite', 'accurate.There', 'long', 'bloody', 'history', 'ethnic', 'groups', 'Yugoslavia', 'none', 'are', 'guiltless', 'what', 'happened', 'early', '90s', 'was', 'almost', 'ENTIRELY', 'doing', 'Serb', 'leadership', 'namely', 'Karazdic', 'Milosevic', 'who', 'deserve', 'special', 'seat', 'hell', 'was', 'also', 'fault', 'West', 'namely', 'West', 'Europeans', 'nothing', 'was', 'done', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'had', 'been', 'displaced', 'killed', 'wounded', '-in', 'particular', 'British', 'government', 'was', 'openly', 'sympathetic', 'Serbian', 'side', 'much', 'Western', 'Europeans', 'also', 'were', 'afraid', 'having', 'Muslim', 'state', 'doorstep', 'reason', 'keep', 'refusing', 'Turkey', 'entry', 'EU', 'was', 'also', 'partially', 'Clinton', 'fault', 'refusing', 'go', 'alone', 'when', 'Europeans', 'balked', 'much', 'too', 'late', 'game', 'least', 'US', 'military', 'power', 'was', 'used', 'cause', 'other', 'oil', 'imperialism', 'change', 'Welcome', 'Sarajevo', 'touches', 'points', 'very', 'subtly', 'not', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'soapbox-and-a-megaphone', 'type', 'movie', 'kind', 'schmaltzy', 'posturing', 'Hollywood', 'misery-exploitation', 'movie', 'feared', 'when', 'saw', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'had', 'one', 'starring', 'roles.As', 'filmmaking', 'competent', 'hardly', 'stellar', '-pacing', 'bit', 'slow', 'dialogue', 'acting', 'was', 'jarringly', 'subpar', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'was', 'NOT', 'well', 'directed', 'plot', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'ordinary', 'However', 'history', 'journalism', 'worth', 'watching', 'film', 'usual', 'nightly', '30', 'seconds', 'carnage', 'film', 'footage', 'conflict', 'showing', 'not', 'only', 'physical', 'also', 'mental', 'emotional', 'environment', 'people', 'endured', 'so', 'many', 'years.The', 'last', 'scene', 'classical', 'concert', 'outdoors', 'Sarajevo', 'end', 'hostilities', 'simple', 'direct', 'beautiful.PS', 'also', 'true', 'however', 'had', 'what', 'happened', 'ex-Yugoslavia', 'happened', 'Third-World', 'non-white', 'country', 'much', 'worse', 'things', 'DO', 'happen', 'countries', 'time', 'e.g', 'Sudan', 'Rwanda', 'never', 'would', ""'ve"", 'garnered', 'anywhere', 'as', 'much', 'media', 'attention', 'also', 'sadly', 'true', 'had', 'victims', 'been', 'Christians', 'instead', 'Muslims', 'more', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'done', 'much', 'much', 'sooner']",Welcome to Sarajevo VHS
440609,A2SUDR7YAI2ZQA,6304938225,Edward Bosnar,"[12, 32]","This film tried to do too many things at the same time. It was an attempt to portray life in Sarajevo under siege, the plight of its citizens, the efforts made by foreign aid workers, the misadventures of foreign journalists, etc. In the end, it failed in all of these aspects. Except for the actual documentary footage of the notorious bread-line massacre, nowhere did this film adequately convey the horror of the war. Even though based loosely a true story, ""Welcome to Sarajevo"" was largely unconvincing; the direction and production were poor, and the actors generally seemed to be going through the motions. Thus, in most scenes in wartime Sarajevo, the various characters seem to act as though they're stuck in some provincial bus station rather than huddled in shelters to keep from getting hit by artillery shells or sniper bullets. In some ways it almost seems to romanticize life in the city during the siege - although you'll have a hard time finding any Sarajevan today who looks back on those years with anything resembling fondness. Another troubling aspect of this film is that it tends to take a very condescending and self-serving attitude: it's basically up to Western reporters and aid workers to save the children of Sarajevo, rather than the efforts of the locals. Although the intentions of the producers may have been noble, ""Welcome to Sarajevo"" is a misleading and condescending film.",1,Dull and unrealistic,977529600,"12 23, 2000",2000,1410,"['film', 'tried', 'do', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'same', 'time', 'was', 'attempt', 'portray', 'life', 'Sarajevo', 'siege', 'plight', 'citizens', 'efforts', 'made', 'foreign', 'aid', 'workers', 'misadventures', 'foreign', 'journalists', 'etc', 'end', 'failed', 'aspects', 'actual', 'documentary', 'footage', 'notorious', 'bread-line', 'massacre', 'nowhere', 'did', 'film', 'adequately', 'convey', 'horror', 'war', 'Even', 'based', 'loosely', 'true', 'story', 'Welcome', 'Sarajevo', 'was', 'largely', 'unconvincing', 'direction', 'production', 'were', 'poor', 'actors', 'generally', 'seemed', 'be', 'going', 'motions', 'Thus', 'most', 'scenes', 'wartime', 'Sarajevo', 'various', 'characters', 'seem', 'act', ""'re"", 'stuck', 'provincial', 'bus', 'station', 'rather', 'huddled', 'shelters', 'keep', 'getting', 'hit', 'artillery', 'shells', 'sniper', 'bullets', 'ways', 'almost', 'romanticize', 'life', 'city', 'siege', ""'ll"", 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'finding', 'Sarajevan', 'today', 'who', 'back', 'years', 'anything', 'resembling', 'fondness', 'troubling', 'aspect', 'film', 'take', 'very', 'condescending', 'self-serving', 'attitude', 'basically', 'up', 'Western', 'reporters', 'aid', 'workers', 'save', 'children', 'Sarajevo', 'rather', 'efforts', 'locals', 'intentions', 'producers', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'noble', 'Welcome', 'Sarajevo', 'misleading', 'condescending', 'film']",Welcome to Sarajevo VHS

He is perfect in his role. Stephen Dillane is a British journalist who, along with Harrelson and others, is in Sarajevo covering the war in Bosnia. It is interesting to see how headlines are made, how stories compete with one another for the headline. What is the most horrible or gripping thing to happen and who gets the scoop? It is almost disheartening really... when complete trash or gossip grabs the headlines over atrocities committed in some place in the world that the British, American, or Western European audiences want to ignore or forget. Dillane chases stories, but eventually he becomes stuck on one story only-an orphanage in Bosnia and the children who are suffering there. Eventually he adopts one of the girls from the orphanage and takes her back to England with her. Naturally there are complications and a fascinating story that makes up all the details that lead to the adoption.

You are put right where the action is and the lives of these journalists are on the line. The acting was superb by Stephen Dillane and his character seemed real. Woody Harrelson, on the other hand, was shallow and appeared to be a slam on Americans. If he was a composite/representative of American journalists covering this war, then I understand somewhat why others hate us. His flippant attitude belied what was happening around him. His crack about Muslims killing Christians was gratuitous at best. Muslims have been killing for centuries and when it comes to killing Christians, no one condemns it, except other Christians. I can't speak to the politics of the Bosnian war but at this late date it may be an portent for all of Europe. All war is hell.

440613,A2TT4AA3QO0DPY,6304938225,Jay Young,"[2, 2]","*Possible Spoilers*I will review the movie first, then the DVD. I first watched ""Welcome to Sarajevo"" the week after Easter in 2003. Even though it got a relatively lukewarm reception by critics and moviegoers, I found it powerful. The basic plot of the film is about a British journalist, Michael Henderson (played by Stephen Dillane), who sees a 9 year-old girl named Emira in an orphanage that is bombed. Henderson forms a bond with young Emira, and decides that he must get her out of the country. Now at the time, the UN policy was that no children were to be evacuated from Bosnia, unless they had living relatives in another country. Aware of this policy, Henderson risks jeopardizing his career, getting into legal trouble, and possibly losing his life to find a way to adopt Emira. He eventually succeeds, and Emira happily lives in Henderson's posh London home.""Welcome to Sarajevo"" is a difficult film to watch at times. For example, we see scenes of civilians massacred interspersed with archival news footage of Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic confidently saying that his forces act ""in accordance with the Geneva Convention."" There's one scene that many viewers are bound to find traumatic: several children, including Emira, are on a bus bound for an airport to take them out of the country and to safety. Unfortunately, they are stopped by members of the Chetniks, a Bosnian Serb paramilitary group. One of them boards the bus looks at the list of passengers, and forcefully removes several of the children. Emira would have been among them, but Henderson covers her and cries, ""No! She's English!"" Unfortunately, a baby that Emira had been caring for, Roadrunner, is removed. Nina (Marisa Tomei), an idealistic humanitarian who arranged for the childrens' departure, tries desparately, but in vain, to stop the Chetniks from taking the children.Ultimately, ""Welcome to Sarajevo"" succeeds in giving a sense of what daily life was like in Sarajevo during the war. One word describes it: hopeless. The citizens hoped that someone could protect them sniping and shelling, that someone would get them out of there, but these hopes were unfulfilled. Since Americans were bombarded with news of the Bosnian war on a daily basisy, in a relatively sanitized form, they eventually grew apathetic to the whole thing. Myself included. If nothing else, I think ""Welcome to Sarajevo"" succeeds in portraying the Bosnian war as a true tragedy. For many, it was half a world away, but for those who were there, it was real, and it affected them day in and day out for 4 years.Now for the DVD review. Why are there no extras on the DVD? If ""Black Hawk Down"" can get a 3-disc deluxe edition treatment, why can't ""Welcome to Sarajevo"" get something similar? There's plenty of stuff out there that could be put onto a special edition. For example, on YouTube I found interviews with the cast at the time of filming. In addition, I believe there was a PBS Frontline special about snipers in Sarajevo. If the Black Hawk Down DVD could include a PBS Frontline special among its special features, there's no reason it couldn't be done with this movie. In addition, there's plenty of archival news footage about the Bosnian war that could be put in to the special features. Of course, we could have commentary from the director, cast, and maybe the author of the book ""Natasha's Story."" Since the 10th anniversary of the movie's release is coming in November, I really think that they should at least consider these ideas.",4,"Great movie, but why no extras?",1170288000,"02 1, 2007",2007,3521,"['*Possible', 'Spoilers*I', 'will', 'review', 'movie', 'first', 'then', 'DVD', 'first', 'watched', 'Welcome', 'Sarajevo', 'week', 'Easter', '2003', 'Even', 'got', 'relatively', 'lukewarm', 'reception', 'critics', 'moviegoers', 'found', 'powerful', 'basic', 'plot', 'film', 'British', 'journalist', 'Michael', 'Henderson', 'played', 'Stephen', 'Dillane', 'who', '9', 'year-old', 'girl', 'named', 'Emira', 'orphanage', 'bombed', 'Henderson', 'bond', 'young', 'Emira', 'must', 'get', 'country', 'Now', 'time', 'UN', 'policy', 'was', 'children', 'were', 'be', 'evacuated', 'Bosnia', 'had', 'living', 'relatives', 'country', 'Aware', 'policy', 'Henderson', 'jeopardizing', 'career', 'getting', 'legal', 'trouble', 'possibly', 'losing', 'life', 'find', 'way', 'adopt', 'Emira', 'eventually', 'Emira', 'happily', 'Henderson', 'posh', 'London', 'home', 'Welcome', 'Sarajevo', 'difficult', 'film', 'watch', 'times', 'example', 'see', 'scenes', 'civilians', 'massacred', 'interspersed', 'archival', 'news', 'footage', 'Bosnian', 'Serb', 'President', 'Radovan', 'Karadzic', 'confidently', 'saying', 'forces', 'act', 'accordance', 'Geneva', 'Convention', 'one', 'scene', 'many', 'viewers', 'are', 'bound', 'find', 'traumatic', 'several', 'children', 'including', 'Emira', 'are', 'bus', 'bound', 'airport', 'take', 'country', 'safety', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'stopped', 'members', 'Chetniks', 'Bosnian', 'Serb', 'paramilitary', 'group', 'One', 'boards', 'bus', 'list', 'passengers', 'forcefully', 'several', 'children', 'Emira', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'Henderson', 'cries', 'No', 'English', 'Unfortunately', 'baby', 'Emira', 'had', 'been', 'caring', 'Roadrunner', 'removed', 'Nina', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'idealistic', 'humanitarian', 'who', 'arranged', 'childrens', 'departure', 'desparately', 'vain', 'stop', 'Chetniks', 'taking', 'children.Ultimately', 'Welcome', 'Sarajevo', 'giving', 'sense', 'what', 'daily', 'life', 'was', 'Sarajevo', 'war', 'One', 'word', 'hopeless', 'citizens', 'hoped', 'someone', 'could', 'protect', 'sniping', 'shelling', 'someone', 'would', 'get', 'hopes', 'were', 'unfulfilled', 'Americans', 'were', 'bombarded', 'news', 'Bosnian', 'war', 'daily', 'basisy', 'relatively', 'sanitized', 'form', 'eventually', 'grew', 'apathetic', 'whole', 'thing', 'Myself', 'included', 'nothing', 'else', 'think', 'Welcome', 'Sarajevo', 'portraying', 'Bosnian', 'war', 'true', 'tragedy', 'many', 'was', 'world', 'away', 'who', 'were', 'there', 'was', 'real', 'affected', 'day', 'day', '4', 'years.Now', 'DVD', 'review', 'Why', 'are', 'there', 'no', 'extras', 'DVD', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'can', 'get', '3-disc', 'deluxe', 'edition', 'treatment', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'Welcome', 'Sarajevo', 'get', 'something', 'similar', 'plenty', 'stuff', 'there', 'could', 'be', 'put', 'special', 'edition', 'example', 'YouTube', 'found', 'interviews', 'cast', 'time', 'filming', 'addition', 'believe', 'was', 'PBS', 'Frontline', 'special', 'snipers', 'Sarajevo', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'DVD', 'could', 'include', 'PBS', 'Frontline', 'special', 'special', 'features', 'reason', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'done', 'movie', 'addition', 'plenty', 'archival', 'news', 'footage', 'Bosnian', 'war', 'could', 'be', 'put', 'special', 'features', 'course', 'could', 'have', 'commentary', 'director', 'cast', 'maybe', 'author', 'book', 'Natasha', 'Story', '10th', 'anniversary', 'movie', 'release', 'coming', 'November', 'really', 'think', 'should', 'least', 'consider', 'ideas']",Welcome to Sarajevo VHS

440615,A3AP6H48QHX8BR,6304938225,"Kimberly M. ""Kimberly""","[4, 5]","This movie makes me want to be a journalist. The movie follows the lives of foreign correspondants who become intwined with the Bosnian war occuring in Sarajevo- a war they don't understand. While dealing with the silent tragedies erupting around them . The journalists covering the story of the century feel- frustrated, angry and depressed at times at the world's lack of care to tragedy unfolding in the country. A war in which children playing outside an apartment were considered fair game and a war that civilians were constantly targeted on both sides. A war that to this day is still misunderstood by the world and a genocide of a people that went on unnoticed.To this day people in the United States debate wether or not saving Bosnia was worth committing troops and peacekeeping troops after seeing this movie you'll be horrorified that the US and the rest of the civilized world did not do more. I'm a little biased in my feelings of the conflict my preacher was in Bosnia for a year and I know an immigrant who escaped from the terror that unfolded there. The war was a civil war fought among the states of Yugoslavia-at the fall of communism. States in Yugoslavia began declaring independance based on their ethnic nationality- Serb, Croat, and Muslim... Creating a great amount of ethnic tension that OFFICIALY erupted in 92. The Serbs began trying to reclaim land- as they claimed their land they forced evacuated Muslims and Croats from their home, as well as executed many males and sent others to forced labor camps.  The state of Bosnia the stronghold of Yugoslavia's Muslim population became the center of Serb attack and it's capital Sarajevo became a city under siege.What makes the movie powerful is many of the images/comments used in the movie is from ACTUAL footage-making haunting moments when you realize your looking at ACTUAL footage taken from a reporter who was there.Based on the true story- the movie centers around a British reporter who ends up adopting a Bosian Muslim child- hoping to save her from the conflict and a love between them that blurs his work from his love for his daughter. For he is NOW speaking for his daughter.The movie is a little one-sided in the fact it is clearly ANTI-SERB and the truth is no ethnic group was truly innocent in this conflict.Welcome To Sarajevo shows the blurs between empathy, human nature, and being a witness to untolerable events.

At the same time, however, it does not provide a balanced examination of the situation on the ground, which only weakens the very effect it is trying to create.What the film ends up doing is the one thing it must avoid at all cost in order to be effective: NOT to choose sides.  The Catholic Croats and the Muslims are the ""victims,"" while the Orthodox Serbs are wholly to blame...  That is neither witty nor wise when trying to carry out a ""noble cause.""

Harrelson and Dillane are journalists (U.S. and British, respectively), who were covering the war in Bosnia, specifically in its capital city Sarajevo (with sprinkling of events in other parts of the country).Though the movie does not cover the origins of the conflict, and the differences between Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs, it does provide the insight into the events as experienced by the foreign journalists.  Sprinkled with actual documentary footage, the film is engrossing and educational.Henderson (Dillane) is trying to stay detached from the war, and to restrict his involvement to objective reporting.  This becomes increasingly difficult when he sees a local orphanage being filled with children who witnessed tragedies that would put many brave adults on Prozac and Xanax.  At the same time, Winterbottom interjects his own opinion of the war by inserting actual clips of world leaders expressing displeasure at the conflict, some even denying that there are any atrocities actually going on.I highly recommend this movie to everyone who wants to become acquainted with what the people in the middle of Europe had to live with in the late 20th century, while their neighbors turned a blind eye.

440623,APRZ2IVM8JTLV,6304938225,The Mysterious Traveler,"[2, 2]","WELCOME TO SARAJEVO(1997) Directed by Michael Winterbottom.Starring Woody Harrelson, Emily Lloyd and Marisa Tomei.Excellent film about the siege of Sarajevo during the 1992-3 period of the breakup of Yugoslavia and the ethnic cleansing and mass murder committed by the Serbians told from the point of view of several reporters in the city particularly one who finally decides to save one nine year old girl and bring her to England. The minimal plot serves primarily to allow the director to document what was going on allowing the film to effectively recreate the history involved. There is none of that oh so noble reporter for the Commun...excuse..leftist cause that mars so many modern reporter covering a war films. The film strongly condemns the West in general and the UN in specific for being utterly impotent and useless.The film is gritty, violent, gory and, surprisingly for a modern film, informed, intelligent, fair and balanced. The film does not take any political sides. There is no liberal propaganda and the film is wildly politically incorrect as characters smoke with carefree abandon and a Christian priest--possibly Catholic-- is portrayed heroically. The film is well directed using a hand held camera approach that allows it to seamlessly incorporate real footage of the war.The only cautionary note one must mention, and it is sad that one must point it out but one must be fair to Liberals who might consider watching this, is the scene where an American reporter apologizes for the US's failure to come to Bosia's aid stating that if it were Christians being murdered by Muslems, things would be different when, as we know in today, the same persons who countenanced mass murder and genocide in the 90s turned out to be gleefully willing do so still no matter what race or religion is being slaughtered and even if they are Americans. So the scene has a real retroactive snap to it. Yet the filmmakers obviously did not know that this would be the case after 2001 and the film cannot be fairly judged to have made that biting critique knowingly. History simply caught up and passed it by so one hopes the film will not become a target for the PC Thought Police because it accidentally attacks the Clintonistas and their Allies in one inadvertent scene. One simply could not truly anticipate how low Liberals would descend after 9/11 so a film made in 1997 should not be castigated for accidentally telling a great historical truth of our time. Hollywood will simply have to stop making films that portray genocide in a negative light or things like this will happen again and again.This is a very fine historical film and well worth ones time.",5,"It has happened, it is happening, it will happen tomorrow",1336953600,"05 14, 2012",2012,2670,"['WELCOME', 'TO', 'SARAJEVO', '1997', 'Directed', 'Michael', 'Winterbottom.Starring', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Emily', 'Lloyd', 'Marisa', 'Tomei.Excellent', 'film', 'siege', 'Sarajevo', '1992-3', 'period', 'breakup', 'Yugoslavia', 'ethnic', 'cleansing', 'mass', 'murder', 'committed', 'Serbians', 'told', 'point', 'view', 'several', 'reporters', 'city', 'particularly', 'one', 'who', 'finally', 'save', 'one', 'nine', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'bring', 'England', 'minimal', 'plot', 'serves', 'primarily', 'allow', 'director', 'document', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'allowing', 'film', 'effectively', 'recreate', 'history', 'involved', 'none', 'oh', 'so', 'noble', 'reporter', 'Commun', 'excuse..leftist', 'cause', 'so', 'many', 'modern', 'reporter', 'covering', 'war', 'films', 'film', 'strongly', 'West', 'general', 'UN', 'specific', 'being', 'utterly', 'impotent', 'useless.The', 'film', 'gritty', 'violent', 'gory', 'surprisingly', 'modern', 'film', 'informed', 'intelligent', 'fair', 'balanced', 'film', 'not', 'take', 'political', 'sides', 'liberal', 'propaganda', 'film', 'wildly', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'characters', 'smoke', 'carefree', 'abandon', 'Christian', 'priest', 'possibly', 'Catholic', 'portrayed', 'heroically', 'film', 'well', 'directed', 'using', 'hand', 'held', 'camera', 'approach', 'seamlessly', 'incorporate', 'real', 'footage', 'war.The', 'only', 'cautionary', 'note', 'one', 'must', 'mention', 'sad', 'one', 'must', 'point', 'out', 'one', 'must', 'be', 'fair', 'Liberals', 'who', 'might', 'consider', 'watching', 'scene', 'where', 'American', 'reporter', 'apologizes', 'US', 'failure', 'come', 'Bosia', 'aid', 'stating', 'were', 'Christians', 'being', 'murdered', 'Muslems', 'things', 'would', 'be', 'different', 'when', 'know', 'today', 'same', 'persons', 'who', 'countenanced', 'mass', 'murder', 'genocide', '90s', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'gleefully', 'willing', 'do', 'so', 'still', 'matter', 'what', 'race', 'religion', 'being', 'slaughtered', 'even', 'are', 'Americans', 'scene', 'real', 'retroactive', 'snap', 'filmmakers', 'obviously', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'would', 'be', 'case', '2001', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'fairly', 'judged', 'have', 'made', 'biting', 'critique', 'knowingly', 'History', 'simply', 'caught', 'up', 'passed', 'one', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'become', 'target', 'PC', 'Thought', 'Police', 'accidentally', 'Clintonistas', 'Allies', 'one', 'inadvertent', 'scene', 'One', 'simply', 'could', 'not', 'truly', 'anticipate', 'how', 'low', 'Liberals', 'would', 'descend', '9/11', 'so', 'film', 'made', '1997', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'castigated', 'accidentally', 'telling', 'great', 'historical', 'truth', 'time', 'Hollywood', 'will', 'simply', 'have', 'stop', 'making', 'films', 'portray', 'genocide', 'negative', 'light', 'things', 'will', 'happen', 'again', 'again.This', 'very', 'fine', 'historical', 'film', 'well', 'worth', 'ones', 'time']",Welcome to Sarajevo VHS
440624,A33WO1ZS241KTX,6304938225,"""zapasnik""","[43, 50]","In the spring of 1992, news correspondents from around the world descended upon Bosnia to document the most horrific conflict Europe had seen since World War II.  WELCOME TO SARAJEVO is the story of those correspondents and the surreal world they entered when they checked into their rooms at the Holiday Inn (which, as fate would have it, was located right on the infamous boulevard known as Sniper Alley; they couldn't have found a better place to view the action if they tried).One of those correspondents, Michael Henderson (Stephen Dillane), has very little patience with colleagues like Jordan Flynn (Woody Harrelson) who always find ways of involving themselves in the stories they're covering.  &quot;We're not here to help - we're here to report,&quot; he says.  But Henderson finds it increasingly difficult to remain detached from the carnage around him, especially when Serb artillery and Serb snipers start targeting Sarajevo's children.  Frustrated by networks (who would rather lead with stories about the Duchess of York's marital problems) and world leaders (who condemn the killing while allowing it to continue), Henderson finally decides to act; if he can't stop the war, then he can at least save the life of a child.WELCOME TO SARAJEVO is based on &quot;Natasha's Story,&quot; the 1993 memoir of ITN correspondent Michael Nicholson.  Director Michael Winterbottom has fashioned a remarkable film by taking the events in Nicholson's book and interweaving them with actual footage of the siege of Sarajevo.  And he's couldn't have assembled a better cast; Stephen Dillaine and Woody Harrelson give the performances of their careers (thus far) as Henderson and Flynn, and they're ably supported by Kerry Fox, Marisa Tomei, Emira Nusevic, and a charismatic, pre-ER Goran Visnjic (who comes close to walking away with the movie).When WELCOME TO SARAJEVO was released on VHS, one of the Amazon.com reviewers took former President Clinton to task for his &quot;lies&quot; about Bosnia, but he neglected to mention that most of the events depicted in this film (Bosnia's descent into war, the breadline massacre, the establishment of Serb-operated concentration camps in Omarska and Trnopolje) took place when George H.W. Bush was in the White House.  Clearly there's blame enough to go around.  Bosnia wasn't just failed by the U.S., Britain, France, and the U.N.; Bosnia was failed by the world.  And the world should be ashamed.As for WELCOME TO SARAJEVO, it's a vivid and unforgettable portrait of one of the most lunatic periods in recent history.
