178402,AR3BZOTB7IY78,1558804641,Anton Karidian,"[0, 3]","As I said in my subject line, I liked basically the first half of CHEECH AND CHONG'S NEXT MOVIE. Even though there was not much of a plot going on, there was lots of funny stuff in those skits C & C were doing. That skit in the welfare office had me in tears, especially that guy making all the hilarious sound effects! And just looking at C & C's home was fun, like seeing the funny signs hanging up, such as the ""Getting Loaded Zone"" sign. And Cheech's ""Mexican American"" song, followed by Chong's song with absurd lyrics was amusing too. I would have been pleased with this movie if it had all been funny skits like these, even if no plot had developed.But the second half of NEXT MOVIE just drags really badly and is not funny any more. I mean, that long section with Cheech driving the car of that rich couple and telling lame jokes - what the %$!!@# was that?! With no story going on, and little humor either, the second half of the movie just became NOTHING! I also found appalling the three instances of suggested or actual animal abuse in the second half - the frog in blender joke, harassing the cat offscreen, and the rough treatment of chickens in the field where the police car was. Were those supposed to be funny?! Maybe as several reviewers have noted, if I had been smoking a reefer while watching this, I would have found the whole thing a LOT more funny......",2,"First half funny, second half goes nowhere",1328659200,"02 8, 2012",2012,1378,"['said', 'subject', 'line', 'liked', 'basically', 'first', 'half', 'CHEECH', 'AND', 'CHONG', 'NEXT', 'MOVIE', 'Even', 'was', 'not', 'much', 'plot', 'going', 'was', 'lots', 'funny', 'stuff', 'skits', 'C', 'C', 'were', 'doing', 'skit', 'welfare', 'office', 'had', 'tears', 'especially', 'guy', 'making', 'hilarious', 'sound', 'effects', 'just', 'looking', 'C', 'C', 'home', 'was', 'fun', 'seeing', 'funny', 'signs', 'hanging', 'up', 'such', 'Getting', 'Loaded', 'Zone', 'sign', 'Cheech', 'Mexican', 'American', 'song', 'followed', 'Chong', 'song', 'absurd', 'lyrics', 'was', 'amusing', 'too', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'pleased', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'funny', 'skits', 'even', 'plot', 'had', 'developed.But', 'second', 'half', 'NEXT', 'MOVIE', 'just', 'really', 'badly', 'not', 'funny', 'more', 'mean', 'long', 'section', 'Cheech', 'driving', 'car', 'rich', 'couple', 'telling', 'lame', 'jokes', 'what', '%', '@', 'was', 'story', 'going', 'little', 'humor', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'just', 'became', 'NOTHING', 'also', 'found', 'appalling', 'three', 'instances', 'suggested', 'actual', 'animal', 'abuse', 'second', 'half', 'frog', 'blender', 'joke', 'harassing', 'cat', 'offscreen', 'rough', 'treatment', 'chickens', 'field', 'where', 'police', 'car', 'was', 'Were', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'Maybe', 'several', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'had', 'been', 'smoking', 'reefer', 'watching', 'would', 'have', 'found', 'whole', 'thing', 'LOT', 'more', 'funny']",Cheech & Chong's Next Movie VHS

178405,A1ZBAEOCUH1SQV,1558804641,Cool Nerd,"[17, 17]","It's a shame that a film like this will be mostly dismissed by a society that will see this as nothing more than a ""stoner"" film.  While admittedly the humor often contains drug references, there are several scenes that I think anybody could enjoy and have a good laugh at.While I agree with many reviewers here as to what are some of the funnier scenes, the two that really do it for me is the one in the Welfare Office. This is just physical comedy at its very best. While Chong waits for Cheech to ""visit"" with his lady friend, he is seated next to an old man, and a very odd character played by Michael Winslow (and it is very  apparent what a brilliant comic he is, and it's too bad his talents went to waste in countless Police Academy sequels). I cannot even begin to describe this scene, but those who have seen the movie know what I am talking about. Those who haven't need to do themselves a favor and watch the movie, if only for this scene alone. Even the look on Chong's face is authentic--he's not acting here--he is equally confused and entertained by what's happening around him.Shortly after this scene comes another great one, where Cheech performs his song, a warm and loving (and hilarious) tribute to Mexican Americans. It has been days since I watched this and I still have that song in my head.I would highly (no pun intended) recommend this film to anybody that needs a great laugh and is not easily offended by drug and sex jokes.",4,Has The Best Movie Scene Ever,1109289600,"02 25, 2005",2005,1455,"['shame', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'mostly', 'dismissed', 'society', 'will', 'see', 'nothing', 'more', 'stoner', 'film', 'admittedly', 'humor', 'often', 'drug', 'references', 'are', 'several', 'scenes', 'think', 'anybody', 'could', 'enjoy', 'have', 'good', 'laugh', 'at.While', 'agree', 'many', 'reviewers', 'here', 'what', 'are', 'funnier', 'scenes', 'two', 'really', 'do', 'one', 'Welfare', 'Office', 'just', 'physical', 'comedy', 'very', 'best', 'Chong', 'waits', 'Cheech', 'visit', 'lady', 'friend', 'seated', 'next', 'old', 'man', 'very', 'odd', 'character', 'played', 'Michael', 'Winslow', 'very', 'apparent', 'what', 'brilliant', 'comic', 'too', 'bad', 'talents', 'went', 'waste', 'countless', 'Police', 'Academy', 'sequels', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'begin', 'describe', 'scene', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'know', 'what', 'am', 'talking', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'need', 'do', 'favor', 'watch', 'movie', 'only', 'scene', 'alone', 'Even', 'look', 'Chong', 'face', 'authentic', 'not', 'acting', 'here', 'equally', 'confused', 'entertained', 'what', 'happening', 'around', 'him.Shortly', 'scene', 'great', 'one', 'where', 'Cheech', 'song', 'warm', 'loving', 'hilarious', 'tribute', 'Mexican', 'Americans', 'been', 'days', 'watched', 'still', 'have', 'song', 'head.I', 'would', 'highly', 'pun', 'intended', 'recommend', 'film', 'anybody', 'great', 'laugh', 'not', 'easily', 'offended', 'drug', 'sex', 'jokes']",Cheech & Chong's Next Movie VHS

Basically this film is a series of loosely tied together lowbrow comic vignettes, some involving dope, some not, centered around some colorful L.A. locales.  Cheech does double duty here by playing both himself and his Texas cousin,Red.  Film is also notable for an early appearance by Paul Reubens as Pee Wee Herman, albeit foul-mouthed.  Michael Winslow a.k.a the sound-effects guy from the ""Police Academy"" movies has a hilarious bit at the welfare office.

Thinking back on my C & C experience, I picked it up just to see what a C & C movie was like.It's a funny movie! No doubt! And it's rather well put together. The movie is a marvelous collection of sight gags, The comedy is highly exaggerated and somewhat badly dated. Nevertheless, It's funny and brings back a lot of amusing memories of easy-going times. Both my wife and I enjoyed it, although the movie is so old she wasn't even born yet at the time the movie was made.

The scene at the beginning of the film (Cheech and Chong syphening gasoline) is hilarious (remember, this was made in 1980 with the gas crisis still on everyone's mind).  The scene where Cheech and Chong improvise a song about ""beaners"" (showing that Cheech and Chong were doing racial humour way before the overrated Carlos Mencia) is great, too.

Aside from realizing I shouldn't have been watching those movies in my pre-teen days, I realized how well done they are.  Most amazing to me was that they  held up one after the other, feeling not repetitive, though each of them is rather episodic. Most impressive was Chong's direction; he makes a number of interesting choices that elevate him beyond the status of writer/star who has enough power to direct; clearly, he took this role quite seriously.  The movies, of course, are not serious.  I rarely laugh out loud in movies these days, but I did at least a half dozen times in each of these.

This was, as the title says their &quot;Next Movie&quot; and shortly after this they released a few more before they finally split up in the early 80s when Cheech took a movie offer (Born in East L.A.)without Tommy Chong.Of all the Cheech &amp; Chong movies, their first two were the best, so if you're looking for their best work, look no further.My only complaint and reason for not giving it 5 stars is that they don't offer it on DVD.
