She begins having visions of her great-grandmother dancing naked and turning into a werewolf. After watching her sister having sex w/ her husband, Daniela lures her brother-inlaw into the woods, where she goes all feral and rips his throat out w/ her teeth! Thus begins her descent into insanity and further neggidness! Daniela is put in restraints in a mental ward, until a spritely nymphomaniac gal lets her loose, only to become another victim. Once out, Daniela is picked up by a dirty old man who tries to rape her. Huge mistake! He is dealt with in grisly fashion! Next, Daniela meets a nice guy who means her no harm. This leads to the only true happiness in Daniela's life. Unfortunately, this is short-lived, as a trio of scumbags follow her home one night and... well, you can probably guess what happens. The rest is a revenge flick w/ the tattered remains of Daniela's mind reaching their final limit. I felt sorry for Daniela and hated (most of) her victims. Who wouldn't cheer her on during the junkyard vengeance scene?? I like this movie a lot, but keep granny and the small-fry far away!...",4,Grrrrrrl Power!...,1156204800,"08 22, 2006",2006,1177,"['Daniela', 'Annik', 'Borel', 'haunted', 'rape', 'suffered', 'child', 'having', 'visions', 'great-grandmother', 'dancing', 'naked', 'turning', 'werewolf', 'watching', 'sister', 'having', 'sex', 'w/', 'husband', 'Daniela', 'brother-inlaw', 'woods', 'where', 'feral', 'throat', 'out', 'teeth', 'Thus', 'descent', 'insanity', 'further', 'neggidness', 'Daniela', 'put', 'restraints', 'mental', 'ward', 'spritely', 'nymphomaniac', 'gal', 'loose', 'only', 'become', 'victim', 'Once', 'out', 'Daniela', 'picked', 'up', 'dirty', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'rape', 'Huge', 'mistake', 'dealt', 'grisly', 'fashion', 'Next', 'Daniela', 'nice', 'guy', 'who', 'harm', 'only', 'true', 'happiness', 'Daniela', 'life', 'Unfortunately', 'short-lived', 'trio', 'scumbags', 'follow', 'home', 'one', 'night', 'well', 'can', 'probably', 'guess', 'what', 'rest', 'revenge', 'flick', 'w/', 'tattered', 'remains', 'Daniela', 'mind', 'reaching', 'final', 'limit', 'felt', 'sorry', 'Daniela', 'hated', 'most', 'victims', 'Who', 'would', ""n't"", 'cheer', 'junkyard', 'vengeance', 'scene', 'movie', 'lot', 'keep', 'granny', 'small-fry', 'far', 'away']",Werewolf Woman VHS

Obsessed with a supposedly lycanthropic ancestor, Daniela eventually comes to believe that she suffers the same affliction, and soon begins to go on gory male killing sprees at night.  Her reign of terror is momentarily ended by a forced visit to a lunatic asylum, but she escapes with the assistance of another female patient who Daniela repays by stabbing to death.  The murders continue until the police finally catch up with her.  At the end, the viewer learns that the whole shocking story is absolutely true!Cheap, exploitative euro-trash, much less fun than it should be thanks to Rino Di Silvestro's amazingly shoddy direction, which mostly consists of a preponderance of sloppily utilized handheld cameras and an incredible over reliance on the zoom lens.  The infamously poor werewolf ""special effects"", proudly on view in the hilarious opening credits sequence, are pathetic beyond belief.  Lots of nudity and gore, and the presence of the beautiful Dagmar Lassander in a minor role, do nothing to stop this from being one of the very dullest of all Italian horror offerings, as well as possibly the absolute worst lycanthropy themed movie ever made.The Shriek Show DVD is an anamorphic wide-screen (1.85:1)  presentation of this ludicrous effort, utilizing an okay if somewhat weatherbeaten print, with plenty of speckles throughout.  Extras consist of a filmed interview with Rino Di Silvestro and a gallery of his graphics work (unrelated to the film), a poster and photo gallery, and theatrical trailers of other Shriek Show releases,  TWO ORPHANED VAMPIRES, PLANKTON, GRAVEYARD SHIFT and FIANCEE OF DRACULA. If you are already one of the very few fans of the film, this is a recommended purchase.

494921,A23LA1XM5VRV32,B000007P8B,"Free Free ""Thee Highest""","[0, 1]","This is one of my favorite films, but this Shriek Show version is the worst possible way to see Anik Borel get naked and freak out. The VHS version is the only way to see the shorter, more entertaining, and properly-framed American cut. This is one of those rare cases where less IS more. The European version tries to pretend this is a serious character study of a woman who imagines herself to be a werewolf to deal with a past sexual trauma, and it is pretty dull. The shorter, American cut realizes this is a great excuse to get a weird-looking, but somehow sexy, woman to take off her clothes and FREAK OUT like an Oscar-hopeful! Her performance is really one of the greatest things ever captured on film. The Shriek Show DVD also cuts off MUCH of the top, bottom and BOTH sides of the image. Why? Who knows? If you plan on buying a VHS copy of this, BEWARE: I bought one through Amazon and it turned out to be a bootleg that was so watery and dark, it was basically unwatchable. The Sinister version is the best DVD copy of this film that I've seen, so far. I haven't seen the Japanese DVD, but don't they still fog parts of the image they think will turn you into a werewolf? I've seen other Shriek Show DVD's that were well-done, so this is the one strike out from an otherwise pretty cool company.",1,"The movie is great, this DVD sucks!",1276905600,"06 19, 2010",2010,1306,"['one', 'favorite', 'films', 'Shriek', 'Show', 'version', 'worst', 'possible', 'way', 'see', 'Anik', 'Borel', 'get', 'naked', 'freak', 'out', 'VHS', 'version', 'only', 'way', 'see', 'shorter', 'more', 'entertaining', 'properly-framed', 'American', 'cut', 'one', 'rare', 'cases', 'where', 'less', 'IS', 'more', 'European', 'version', 'tries', 'pretend', 'serious', 'character', 'study', 'woman', 'who', 'be', 'werewolf', 'deal', 'past', 'sexual', 'trauma', 'pretty', 'dull', 'shorter', 'American', 'cut', 'realizes', 'great', 'excuse', 'get', 'weird-looking', 'somehow', 'sexy', 'woman', 'take', 'off', 'clothes', 'FREAK', 'OUT', 'Oscar-hopeful', 'performance', 'really', 'one', 'greatest', 'things', 'ever', 'captured', 'film', 'Shriek', 'Show', 'DVD', 'also', 'off', 'MUCH', 'top', 'bottom', 'BOTH', 'sides', 'image', 'Why', 'Who', 'plan', 'buying', 'VHS', 'copy', 'BEWARE', 'bought', 'one', 'Amazon', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'bootleg', 'was', 'so', 'watery', 'dark', 'was', 'basically', 'unwatchable', 'Sinister', 'version', 'best', 'DVD', 'copy', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Japanese', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'still', 'fog', 'parts', 'image', 'think', 'will', 'turn', 'werewolf', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'Shriek', 'Show', 'DVD', 'were', 'well-done', 'one', 'strike', 'otherwise', 'pretty', 'cool', 'company']",Werewolf Woman VHS
494922,AM0G4IO57D2Z4,B000007P8B,"""ninetwob""","[5, 13]","It talks about the werewolf, but there is only one scene, which a woman became a wolf at the beginning of the film. I thought that this film is the werewolf movie when I saw the title of this film, but there is no werewolf woman. There is only insane woman who kills people ridiculously. The woman kills people because her ancestor, who was a werewolf, appears and manipulates her to kill people. In addition, she has a memory that she was raped when she was young. After that, she has a terror about the male and also has a disgusting feeling about sex. So, she kills people when they have sex or they are related to sexual actions. The scenes of murder are crude, and bombastic performance as well. I think that this film is trying to explain the poor insane woman why she killed people. However, it is not convincing.

She gets raped and I guess this lets her tap into her ancestery, which in turn lets her just go absolutely nuts for the rest of the movie.No werewolf transformation, though. She is affected by the moon, but it doesn't turn her into a furball. It just turns her into a murderer. So she goes on a rampage and kills a lot until she finds love.
