1614048,AC4XV78EJG1QB,B00AN10MWW,Anne,"[1, 1]","I love this movie.  It's right up there with Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day (another of my favorites which has a similar sort of storyline because it happens in one day).  I want to mention though that I wish they had shown different people on the front of the movie cover.  Only two of the people on the front are significant characters.  It seems odd to me.This movie is fun because the main character is very likeable.  It's easy to sympathize with her and you know there's going to be the scent of romance budding from friendship somewhere in this movie from the teaser.  The guy who places the protagonist is also very likeable and a very enjoyable character.  The chemistry between the two is great!I'd recommend this one if you loved Miss Pettigrew.  And if you love this one, I'd recommend the other to you!

1614052,A37FUJC2L7DSPT,B00AN10MWW,"J. L LaRegina ""Jim LaRegina""","[1, 1]","Writer-director David H. Steinberg's 2013 romantic comedy/fantasy MISS DIAL requires you to suspend a good amount of disbelief.  For example, from what we can see of lead character Erica's apartment, it looks pretty nice and yet she seems to be paying for it on the salary of a customer service representative.  But thanks to its witty, fast-moving story and an engrossing performance by Robinne Lee as Erica, MISS DIAL keeps that and a few other too-convenient plot devices from distracting you.Until its final moments, MISS DIAL takes place in that well-kept home, venturing no farther than locations of individuals with whom Erica communicates by telephone we see via split screen.  When I realized this film wasn't going to include a car chase or bar fight I wondered if it was originally a stage play, but from what I can tell it is only a movie.MISS DIAL may appeal to phone freaks more than it does to me, as I'm not one for blabbing on the telephone.  God knows there are those who find intimacy holding that handset, the mobile phone era a godsend.  But I can't deny feeling Erica's rush when she decides to knock off her customer service calls to instead randomly phone strangers, just to talk.  I wondered if MISS DIAL would prove a slice of life, perhaps challenging the audience with no real payoff other than a look at this woman as she whimsically dials one unknown person after another.  However, as I don't want to give away too much of the story, I'll just say MISS DIAL ventures into both the heartbreak and thrill of romance.  Those better at picking up hints might guess how all this wraps up, but it pleased me to be caught by surprise.FACEBOOK is also used to move along the MISS DIAL plot.  And while some time ago I un-friended my handful of ""friends"" after pondering the vapidity of it, those who can't get enough of the web site will find MISS DIAL that much more topical.See MISS DIAL.  As I write this on March 31, 2013, it dawns on me that this fun little film may have gone from the theaters to D.V.D./television as quickly as you let a strange phone number on your caller I.D. (Has Erica called you?) go to voice mail, if MISS DIAL even played on the big screen.  Here's hoping MISS DIAL finds the audience it deserves.  You'll root for Erica to find what she wants.",4,Touch tone,1364688000,"03 31, 2013",2013,2298,"['Writer-director', 'David', 'H.', 'Steinberg', '2013', 'romantic', 'comedy/fantasy', 'MISS', 'DIAL', 'suspend', 'good', 'amount', 'disbelief', 'example', 'what', 'can', 'see', 'lead', 'character', 'Erica', 'apartment', 'pretty', 'nice', 'yet', 'be', 'paying', 'salary', 'customer', 'service', 'representative', 'thanks', 'witty', 'fast-moving', 'story', 'engrossing', 'performance', 'Robinne', 'Lee', 'Erica', 'MISS', 'DIAL', 'few', 'other', 'too-convenient', 'plot', 'devices', 'distracting', 'final', 'moments', 'MISS', 'DIAL', 'place', 'well-kept', 'home', 'venturing', 'farther', 'locations', 'individuals', 'whom', 'Erica', 'telephone', 'see', 'split', 'screen', 'When', 'realized', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'include', 'car', 'chase', 'bar', 'fight', 'wondered', 'was', 'originally', 'stage', 'play', 'what', 'can', 'tell', 'only', 'movie.MISS', 'DIAL', 'may', 'appeal', 'phone', 'freaks', 'more', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'blabbing', 'telephone', 'God', 'are', 'who', 'find', 'intimacy', 'holding', 'handset', 'mobile', 'phone', 'era', 'godsend', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deny', 'feeling', 'Erica', 'rush', 'when', 'knock', 'off', 'customer', 'service', 'instead', 'randomly', 'phone', 'strangers', 'just', 'talk', 'wondered', 'MISS', 'DIAL', 'would', 'prove', 'slice', 'life', 'perhaps', 'challenging', 'audience', 'real', 'payoff', 'other', 'look', 'woman', 'whimsically', 'one', 'unknown', 'person', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'story', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'MISS', 'DIAL', 'ventures', 'heartbreak', 'thrill', 'romance', 'better', 'picking', 'up', 'hints', 'might', 'guess', 'how', 'up', 'pleased', 'be', 'caught', 'surprise.FACEBOOK', 'also', 'used', 'move', 'MISS', 'DIAL', 'plot', 'time', 'un-friended', 'handful', 'friends', 'pondering', 'vapidity', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'web', 'site', 'will', 'find', 'MISS', 'DIAL', 'much', 'more', 'topical.See', 'MISS', 'DIAL', 'write', 'March', '31', '2013', 'fun', 'little', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'gone', 'theaters', 'D.V.D./television', 'as', 'quickly', 'let', 'strange', 'phone', 'number', 'caller', 'I.D', 'Has', 'Erica', 'called', 'go', 'voice', 'mail', 'MISS', 'DIAL', 'even', 'played', 'big', 'screen', 'Here', 'hoping', 'MISS', 'DIAL', 'audience', ""'ll"", 'root', 'Erica', 'find', 'what']",Miss Dial

She is a customer rep and has to listen to people call and complain about the products of the company that she works for. Those people that call in are so funny! I would hate being stuck in my apartment all day like she is. So she feels disconnected from the real world so she just dials some random numbers and after a while she gets an EMT on the phone who is soo dreamy- Sam Jaeger from Parenthood. Of course they click and talk on the phone all the time. And then there is Jon Huertas, from Castle, who is her skeevy boyfriend. He is a real piece of work, man! I want to know why Sam Jaeger is not on the front cover on the case since he is the guy that she spends most of her time talking to.
