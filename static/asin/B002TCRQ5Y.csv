The series itself is remarkably well done.  As a staunch Morse fan, I was terribly pleased.

I have never seen the Inspector Morse series of the past but I look forward to seeing it in the future so I can see how the character of Inspector Lewis has developed.  The series takes place in Oxford, England and it begins with Inspector Lewis returning from a long term departure, after the death of his wife in a hit and run and the death of his long time partner Inspector Morse.  Inspector Lewis has to deal with the changing atmosphere of the force and finds himself with a younger brilliant but distant partner Detective Hathaway. The only thing that hasn't changed is human behavior as Oxford seems to be a flatbed for murders.I really love Kevin Whately, I think he is an excellent actor and he plays his character so well.  I think the relationship he develops with Detective Hathaway (Lawrence Fox) is wonderful, they have such excellent chemistry that is really hard to find between two actors from different age groups.

But the mysteries are every bit as good, and in some cases better.  So if one is more interested in the plots than the characters, then this is for you.  Indeed, the episode ""And The Moonbeams Kiss The Sea"" has got to be one of the best I have ever seen.  The others are good, solid who done its with excellent cinematography.What forces me to rate this a 4 instead of a 5 is the rather sloppy job done on the sound, which is poorly equalized and not normalized.  This makes it difficult to hear the actors talking clearly.  If one is used to British English, perhaps there is no problem, but Lewis talks like he has marbles in his mouth, and often mumbles.  I would often back up the DVD to catch what he was saying.  That is, by the way, the single biggest advantage of getting the DVDs.  The ability to back up and carefully listen to the words.The plots are great, however.  I will get series 3 and 4 when they finally get around to releasing them.Below is a list of what is on the DVDs:0.

Whom The Gods Would DestroyLewis and Hathaway investigate a murder involving a group called the Sons of the Twice Born named after an epithet of Dionysus relating to his birth, whose activities are shrouded in Greek codes, quotes from Nietzsche and a Dionysian fondness for drugs.2. Old School TiesWhen an ambitious Oxford student is found dead in her hotel room after inviting a reformed computer hacker to speak at the Union, Lewis and Hathaway are called in to investigate. The pair are soon drawn into a case driven by celebrity, ambition and dangerous sexual politics, which strikes alarming chords with Lewis.3. ExpiationLewis and Hathaway investigate the alleged suicide of a housewife living in Summertown.Series two1. And The Moonbeams Kiss The SeaLewis and Hathaway investigate the death of a maintenance engineer found shot in the head in the basement of the Bodleian Library. A search of the dead man's house reveals a stash of valuable volumes and a connection to the local gamblers anonymous group, with further probing exposing a scam involving two Oxford academics.2. Music To Die ForLewis and Hathaway are called in to investigate a boxing scam, a close link to Lewis' old boss, Inspector Morse, and a love triangle linked to the Stasi.3. Life Born Of FireLewis investigates when a devout young Christian desecrates a church by committing suicide on its altar, claiming in a call to the police that it was ""murder"". Hathaway recognises him as Will McEwan, an old school friend. As the detectives delve deeper, a series of gruesome murders occur, all involving members of ""The Garden"", a modern Christian club, and Hathaway, who once trained for the priesthood, appears to know a lot more than he is willing to tell his boss.4.

1287978,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B002TCRQ5Y,Z Hayes,"[0, 0]","I've never watched the original series as telecast in the UK, so I'm not able to comment on the editing done on the PBS Masterpiece Mystery series of DVDs. Having caught up with some of the Inspector Morse episodes, I can see the evolution of Lewis' character (brilliantly portrayed by Kevin Whately) from a diligent albeit lowly sergeant under the guidance of the amazing Chief Inspector Morse (John Thaw) to a confident, outspoken, yet still down to earth DI who now has his own underling in the form of the intellectual, gifted DS Hathaway (Lawrence Fox).The Pilot features DI Robbie Lewis (Kevin Whately) returning from abroad and getting involved in the investigation of the murder of a math student. His assistant is DS Hathaway (Lawrence Fox), a theology graduate from Cambridge. Insp. Morse may no longer be with him, but let's just say he does help Lewis, and crosswords are involved!In Series One, there are three riveting episodes set in Oxford:Whom the Gods Would Destroy - When an Oxford don's former classmate is found murdered, he comes under suspicion, but Lewis and Hathaway need to tread with care given the sensitive nature of the case.Old School Ties - Lewis is not happy when he is assigned ""babysitting"" duties with Hathaway. The celebrity in need of protecting is a reformed criminal turned celebrity author. When an attractive young student turns up dead, there are many suspects to choose from - her circle of collegemates who all seem to be rather ambivalent in their feelings toward the girl, and also the celebrity himself. When the celebrity himself ends up murdered, Lewis' past comes back in the attractive form of his ex-schoolmate and ex-girlfriend, who turns out to be the widower/ agent of the dead man.Expiation - An apparent suicide of a North Oxford housewife perplexes Lewis. There was no suicide note, and the dead woman's life seemed too perfect to be true. Lewis and Hathaway dig deeper to get at the truth.Season 2 of Inspector Lewis is quite an engaging series, containing many interesting episodes featuring DI Lewis (Kevin Whately) and DS Hathaway (Lawrence Fox). Part of what makes Insp. Lewis a charming series for me is the banter between Lewis and the more cerebral, Cambridge-educated (in theology), Hathaway.  There's lots to satisfy the discerning viewer in Season 2 - picturesque Oxford, literary references, and riveting plots, not to mention the excellent ensemble cast.Season 2 contains the following episodes:And The Moonbeams Kiss the Sea - One of my favorites of all the Lewis episodes. This is not only well-written, but is also atmospheric. Lewis and Hathaway try to discover the link between two murders. One is of a maintenance worker at Oxford's Bodleain Library, and the other is of a popular art student. As they dig deeper, they find out that the two deaths are related to some high level forgery involving works of the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Oxford dons addicted to gambling.Music to Die For - Whilst investigating the murder of an elder gay lecturer, Lewis finds connections to the world of underground amateur boxing, the East German Secret Police (Stasi), and even Lewis' old mentor Morse. Poor Lewis gets sort of entangled with a beautiful German, but are her motives purely romantic?Life Born of Fire - The death of a gay student, gay bashing, and college politics get to Hathaway since the dead student also happened to be Hathaway's friend and former classmate. There are some truly strange twists in this one.The Great and the Good - An intriguing episode. A young girl Beatrice is found drugged and a victim of rape, and evidence points to a certain Oswald Cooper, who himself ends up garrotted and castrated. The question is: who is the killer and what is the motive?Allegory of Love - A mysterious young woman is found killed, the weapon being an antique Persian mirror. This resembles a scene found in a historical novel written by up and coming Oxford author, Dorian Crane. Then another young woman is threatened, leading Lewis and Hathaway on a desperate search for the truth.The Quality of Mercy - death and Shakespeare meet when the actor playing the role of Shylock in The Merchant of Venice is found murdered. When another murder occurs, Lewis and Hathaway find their hands full as the list of suspects gets longer.The Point of Vanishing - Curious case of a man killed in his own bathtub.I'd recommend the Inspector Lewis series to any fan of quality British crime procedurals.",5,Cerebral crime procedural featuring lots of literary references and scenic Oxford,1323302400,"12 8,
