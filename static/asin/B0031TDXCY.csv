I have owned three different versions of Victory at Sea (VHS, 2 different DVD releases) and this is far and away the best one.  The previous best was A&E/History Channel's 4 DVD release.  This Blu Ray provides a clearly noticeable improvement in both audio and video quality over that and all previous releases.  The video is much crisper with much better contrast as well.  The audio is good as well.  There are still flaws in the film and, as noted elsewhere in these reviews, the mildly annoying and ever present ""Periscope Film"" watermark in the lower right hand corner of the screen.  With a program released in 1952, one must accept that it will never be as good as a modern release.  This product is likely to be the best Victory at Sea will ever look and sound.  Buy it!

Beuchert ""History buff""","[1, 4]","I always liked Victory at Sea, if for no other reason than Richard Rodgers wonderful music.However, NBC did not create any kind of masterpiece here. The time allotted and the fewepisodes made any kind of detailed history quite impossible - the show covered the entire 4 yearwar in about 8 hours. So when you watch the Midway episode, for example, about the onlyknowledge you gain is that the battle was important and occurred in July, 1942. Operation Torchepisode (Sea and Sand) leads the viewer to believe that the entire operation went 1-2-3 and was over ina short time. This series therefore falls far short of even being a Readers Digest documentary.It's certainly worth watching, but be aware that it abbreviates everything and includes very little detail.Check out the WWII history section of Amazon books to get the whole story for any events in which youhave further interest.",4,Abbreviated documentaries,1318032000,"10 8, 2011",2011,884,"['always', 'liked', 'Victory', 'Sea', 'other', 'reason', 'Richard', 'Rodgers', 'wonderful', 'music.However', 'NBC', 'did', 'not', 'create', 'kind', 'masterpiece', 'here', 'time', 'allotted', 'fewepisodes', 'made', 'kind', 'detailed', 'history', 'quite', 'impossible', 'show', 'covered', 'entire', '4', 'yearwar', 'about', '8', 'hours', 'So', 'when', 'watch', 'Midway', 'episode', 'example', 'onlyknowledge', 'gain', 'battle', 'was', 'important', 'occurred', 'July', '1942', 'Operation', 'Torchepisode', 'Sea', 'Sand', 'viewer', 'believe', 'entire', 'operation', 'went', '1-2-3', 'was', 'ina', 'short', 'time', 'series', 'therefore', 'far', 'short', 'even', 'being', 'Readers', 'Digest', 'documentary.It', 'certainly', 'worth', 'watching', 'be', 'aware', 'everything', 'very', 'little', 'detail.Check', 'WWII', 'history', 'section', 'Amazon', 'books', 'get', 'whole', 'story', 'events', 'youhave', 'further', 'interest']",N/A

1317850,A2GKUYCO6SGUIB,B0031TDXCY,Peter N. Breitman,"[33, 35]","A good documentary is no different from a good movie: it requires a good script, good actors and good direction. ""Victory at Sea"" is a classic documentary. The script, by Henry Salomon and Richard Hanser, is absolutely magnificent. It does not simply describe the action, but makes our hearts beat much faster because of the ""punching"" nature of the dialogue. Then there is the narrator, the actor in this case, Leonard Graves. The narrator of a similar documentary, ""Air Power,"" was Walter Cronkite. He did an excellent job as a reporter describing the action. However, Leonard Graves does so much more. With him we are not watching the action, WE ARE THERE! The tone of his voice, and the way in which he presented the descriptions of the action put us right in the midst of the fight. We feel as if we are part of history because we were present as it occurred. Near the beginning of the first episode, Mr. Graves said, ""For Fascism to survive, it must kill."" We then knew that the journey would threaten our existence. An example of his narration, which some may feel is depressing (war is not a walk through the park) occurred when he described the casualties resulting from the attack on Pearl Harbor. ""Never before, in modern history, has a war begun with so smashing a victory...188 planes and most of their hangars demolished. The Japanese have lost 29 planes, 68 of their pilots and sailors are dead...one of the cheapest military triumphs on record. Suffering, agony, death. 1,178 men ..... wounded. 68 civilians ..... dead. 109 marines ..... dead. 218 soldiers ..... dead. 2,008 sailors ..... dead."" Also, upon the return to liberate the Philippines, the soldiers were at ""the baseball stadium. But another kind of game is being played now, where one error means out and death keeps the score."" These were not just words. They were delivered with passion, feeling, sadness, and even tenderness when the scene required. One cannot help but share the grief while watching and listening to Mr. Graves. I could go on and on about the fantastic script and the magnificent delivery by Mr. Graves, but this is something that you must see and hear for yourself.Richard Rodgers masterly conveyed the spirit of the action in music. But much more than just sharing the credit was Robert Russell Bennett who orchestrated and ARRANGED this massive score. He was an arranger of many Broadway musicals (including just about all of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals), and a composer in his own right. Pay special attention to the Guadalcanal March in Episode 6 and the string of marches for the nations put together at the end of Episode 26. There is a plethora of marches in this series which is apt because one often relates marches to the military, including those by such famous composers as Kenneth Alford, Eric Coates, John Philip Sousa and even Tchaikovsky. Richard Rodgers outdoes all of them. Each and every march is magnificent. The combination of Leonard Graves' narration and the superlative music completely engrossed me so that there was no way that I could ""put the book down,"" so to speak.""Victory at Sea"" originally aired on television from October 26, 1952 to May 3, 1953. I viewed it several times as it appeared on television over the years. I subsequently purchased the PRE-Blu-ray package, but its quality was nothing to write home about. As much as I enjoyed the experience of watching these episodes, there was the limitation of the quality of the sound and picture as originally made. Remember, this was 1952, before the world of digital.Of course, we must not overlook the direction. The 26 episodes were assembled from about 60 million feet of film obtained from United States, German and Japanese archives, and, I assume, additional footage from Italian, Soviet and other countries' archives. This was edited to about 61,000 feet for broadcast. Even in my wildest imagination, I would not be able to grasp the complexities of this process. To put this all together was a Herculean task, and a fantastic job it was.Now this marvelous series is brought into the world of digital and Blu-ray. From the start, we must realize that most of these pictures were taken in the late 1930s and early to mid-1940s, and the recording was made in 1952. There is no way that either could be the equal of pictures and recordings that are being made today. Today's technologies were not available then. However, as stated above, the technicians substantially improved those pictures and the sound is much more than acceptable. Of just as much importance is the fact that neither the music nor the narration drowns the other out. Both are heard with extreme clarity, something which cannot be said for the PRE-Blu-ray DVDs. I think the technicians did a masterful job.Television appearances of this series over the years have been interrupted by commercials, reducing the 26+ minutes of each episode to about 22 minutes. The present set is absolutely complete.Each complete episode begins with the swirling sea and the V coming out of that sea from the distance, followed by the credits. We then see the name of each episode on the screen with Leonard Graves saying, in his inimitable manner, ""And now, 'Design For War,' and now, 'Melanesian Nightmare,'"" etc. We have just begun our journey.The picture is probably 4x3, or 1.333, the normal size of most older movies, but my Blu-ray player increased the width to 1.419. I don't know if the picture is actually larger than 4x3, or 1.333, or it is just that my player gives it a little extra width. However, the fact that either way it is still less than High Definition width won't affect our viewing pleasure. Again, the quality of the pictures is marvelous, considering their age and how and where they were taken. Don't forget, besides their age, many of them were taken under extreme circumstances - in the midst of war. The black and white photography is so much more effective than color since color would modernize something that belongs in the past. The black and white emphasizes the darkness that war spreads over the world.Just one more word about Leonard Graves. At the end of the second Episode, which involved the attack on Pearl Harbor, as we are viewing the massive destruction caused by the attack of more than 300 planes over a period of almost two hours, we are told that the United States has begun the huge task of rebuilding the fleet. He spoke the following line with utmost feeling: ""In the ruins there is life."" This was the beginning of the resurgence by the United States.I really would like to have seen included with the DVDs a generous booklet describing the action and all of the work that went into the preparation of this documentary. The back of the box lists the names of the episodes, but there is little more. Of course, we have an excellent 36-minute commentary after the end of the 26th Episode which contains a great deal of detail and explanation. Also, if the first disc is put into the Blu-ray drive of a computer, one can see the original publicity booklet for the series with press releases. I may be behind the times, but my computer has a DVD drive, but not a Blu-ray one. I don't know how common the latter might be, but I am told that, for those without one, Periscope Film will post this file on the web in the near future. Therefore, there is no question but that I heartily recommend purchase of this series. If I have to use one word, it is fantabulous.One last word - the United States is not perfect. All of us have one complaint or another, but Mort Sahl once said, ""We all know that America is the worst country in the world, except for all the others."" We exist today as a free democracy only because of the brave men and women who brought us through the perilous times of World War II. They are the greatest heroes of all time. We owe our existence to them.",5,A Marvelous Experience,1284940800,"09 20, 2010",2010,7874,"['good', 'documentary', 'different', 'good', 'movie', 'good', 'script', 'good', 'actors', 'good',

As for suggestions that this is a pirated set, that's highly unlikely for two reasons. First, don't you think NBC would have filed suit if they owned the rights and weren't getting paid? Second, Periscope was working from the original elements, otherwise it would look no better than the DVD. Where do you think Periscope got the original film?
