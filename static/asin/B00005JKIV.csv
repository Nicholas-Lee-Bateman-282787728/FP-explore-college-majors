586766,A2RQYLOWN92CCK,B00005JKIV,A Customer,"[1, 3]","""Don't Say a Word"" is a sleek, engrossing suspense thriller starring Michael Douglas as a top Manhattan psychiatrist who has everything: a beautiful wife (Famke Janssen), an adorable daughter (Skye McCole Bartusiak) and a spacious apartment in the fabulous Ansonia, a Beaux Arts landmark on the Upper West Side.On the day before Thanksgiving, Douglas' Dr. Nathan Conrad is in an accommodating mood when pressed by a former colleague (Oliver Platt) at a psychiatric hospital (modeled on New York's famed Bellevue) to try to break through to a bedraggled, self-destructive 18-year-old (Brittany Murphy).Without help, Platt's Dr. Jerald Sachs argues, in a couple of days, the girl could end up chained to a bed at a mental institution for the rest of her life.Conrad doesn't know that soon he'll have to persuade Murphy's mute Elisabeth to reveal a six-digit number if he's to rescue his daughter, Jessie, kidnapped by thieves led by the brutal Patrick Coster (Sean Bean), a safecracker fresh out of prison. In the meantime, Jennifer Esposito's tenacious NYPD detective is investigating two ostensibly unrelated murders.Director Gary Fleder and writers Anthony Peckham and Patrick Smith Kelly, in adapting Andrew Klavan's novel, tell the story with dispatch and conviction. At the heart of the matter are Conrad's grueling sessions with Elisabeth, during which Douglas draws on his star authority while Murphy reveals Elisabeth as a young woman in the grip of paralyzing fear.The film stretches credibility in demanding Douglas to come across as a potential miracle-worker and two-fisted hero--a man of brilliance, strength and daring. With a terrific assist from Murphy's equally commanding portrayal, Douglas pulls it off.The great-looking ""Don't Say a Word,"" wide-ranging in locations, moves between past and present, presses forward toward the kidnappers' deadline and is heightened by Mark Isham's score. The film's intricate, ingenious structure reveals twists and turns of the human psyche. It demands as much of editors William Steinkamp, Armen Minasian and cinematographer Amir Mokri as it does of the actors.Visual and kinetic, ""Don't Say a Word"" moves like a bullet train through settings actual and constructed, blended seamlessly by production designer Nelson Coates and his staff. ""Don't Say a Word"" is smart, stylish and, most important, satisfying.Basic fact, Douglas doesn't accept any role unless it holds a LOT of meaning...",5,"Splendid movie, killed by critisizm...",1029974400,"08 22, 2002",2002,2440,"['Do', ""n't"", 'Say', 'Word', 'sleek', 'engrossing', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'starring', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'top', 'Manhattan', 'psychiatrist', 'who', 'everything', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'adorable', 'daughter', 'Skye', 'McCole', 'Bartusiak', 'spacious', 'apartment', 'fabulous', 'Ansonia', 'Beaux', 'Arts', 'landmark', 'Upper', 'West', 'Side.On', 'day', 'Thanksgiving', 'Douglas', 'Dr.', 'Nathan', 'Conrad', 'accommodating', 'mood', 'when', 'pressed', 'former', 'colleague', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'psychiatric', 'hospital', 'modeled', 'New', 'York', 'famed', 'Bellevue', 'try', 'break', 'bedraggled', 'self-destructive', '18-year-old', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', '.Without', 'help', 'Platt', 'Dr.', 'Jerald', 'Sachs', 'couple', 'days', 'girl', 'could', 'end', 'up', 'chained', 'bed', 'mental', 'institution', 'rest', 'life.Conrad', ""n't"", 'know', 'soon', ""'ll"", 'have', 'persuade', 'Murphy', 'mute', 'Elisabeth', 'reveal', 'six-digit', 'number', 'rescue', 'daughter', 'Jessie', 'kidnapped', 'thieves', 'led', 'brutal', 'Patrick', 'Coster', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'safecracker', 'prison', 'meantime', 'Jennifer', 'Esposito', 'tenacious', 'NYPD', 'detective', 'investigating', 'two', 'ostensibly', 'unrelated', 'murders.Director', 'Gary', 'Fleder', 'writers', 'Anthony', 'Peckham', 'Patrick', 'Smith', 'Kelly', 'adapting', 'Andrew', 'Klavan', 'novel', 'tell', 'story', 'dispatch', 'conviction', 'heart', 'matter', 'are', 'Conrad', 'grueling', 'sessions', 'Elisabeth', 'Douglas', 'draws', 'star', 'authority', 'Murphy', 'reveals', 'Elisabeth', 'young', 'woman', 'grip', 'paralyzing', 'fear.The', 'film', 'stretches', 'credibility', 'demanding', 'Douglas', 'come', 'potential', 'miracle-worker', 'two-fisted', 'hero', 'man', 'brilliance', 'strength', 'daring', 'terrific', 'assist', 'Murphy', 'equally', 'commanding', 'portrayal', 'Douglas', 'great-looking', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Say', 'Word', 'wide-ranging', 'locations', 'moves', 'past', 'present', 'forward', 'kidnappers', 'deadline', 'heightened', 'Mark', 'Isham', 'score', 'film', 'intricate', 'ingenious', 'structure', 'reveals', 'twists', 'turns', 'human', 'psyche', 'as', 'much', 'editors', 'William', 'Steinkamp', 'Armen', 'Minasian', 'cinematographer', 'Amir', 'Mokri', 'actors.Visual', 'kinetic', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Say', 'Word', 'moves', 'bullet', 'train', 'settings', 'actual', 'constructed', 'blended', 'seamlessly', 'production', 'designer', 'Nelson', 'Coates', 'staff', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Say', 'Word', 'smart', 'stylish', 'most', 'important', 'satisfying.Basic', 'fact', 'Douglas', ""n't"", 'accept', 'role', 'LOT', 'meaning']",N/A

586768,A2RNUR847O8EHZ,B00005JKIV,Amazon Customer,"[0, 2]","DON'T SAY A WORD should and could have been a better movie, and it probably was the first couple hundred times I saw it.  This movie is a hodge-podge collection of other films all rolled in to one.  DON'T SAY A WORD didn't have to say jack for me to see right through it, call the superficial ending from a mile off, and realize that the crazy chick won't do her job and scare the hooey out of me like she should.I rolled to the flick expecting quite a bit more than simply one desperate father's race against time to save his kidnapped daughter from the clutches of some bank bandits with big grudges who demand that our father/psychiatrist dig through the mind of a seemingly insane teen in search of a single six-digit number for God only knows what kind of sick, perverse reason.  That should rap it up.  Close the friggin' book.  Pop some popcorn.  Eat a sandwich.  Turn off the TV.  Kiss the wife.  Go on back to bed.Honestly though, I said it could have been better, that doesn't mean that it completely reeked.  It had some high points.  Michael Douglas (BASIC INSTINCT, TRAFFIC, ROMANCING THE STONE, WONDER BOYS) always does a great job no matter what the role.  In FALLING DOWN he was crazy.  In THE GAME he was rich.  In BASIC INSTINCT he was pleasured.  And in every film, he did his job well.  DON'T SAY A WORD doesn't say anything bad about Douglas.  He plays Dr. Nathan Conrad, the father  mentioned above and you already know his role in the scheme of things.  I choose not to go any further.  His acting is intense and he acts like a concerned father would act: irrational, desperate, super-stressed, etc.One nice thing about the antagonist in the film is that you can almost feel sorry for him at times.  Sean Bean (PATRIOT GAMES, RONIN) plays PATRICK COSTER, a thief who gets roasted by some ""buddies"" in the initial, intense, bank-heist, opener.  (P.S.  This isn't the greatest heist in movie history.  That title would be reserved for HEAT or maybe THE GETAWAY.)  Bean is certainly a memorable villain, because you believe it when he threatens to kill someone.Famke Janssen (X-MEN, ROUNDERS) throws around way too much sex-appeal for a mom as Aggie Conrad.  Moms are not that attractive.  I just don't want to talk about it.  I've had enough.Our little lost girl,  Skye McCole Bartusiak (THE PATRIOT, RIDING IN CARS WITH BOYS) talks quite a bit more in this flick than she chose to in THE PATRIOT.  She plays JESSIE CONRAD, and actually talks too awful much.Brittany Murphy (GIRL INTERRUPTED; 8-MILE) is disappointing as ELIZABETH BURROWS.  When you play a nut, I need you to act just a little bit more insane.  And, if you play someone who is just extremely talented at acting crazy (i.e. Edward Norton as Aaron/Roy in PRIMAL FEAR), you need to act like a friggin' genius and not make stupid moves.  One more addition, if you are going to play stubborn, you can't give in to the probing doctor with anything more than 45 minutes remaining in the film.  These are rules to live by.  Be crazy or don't; be genius or don't; be obstinate or quit wasting my time.  When in doubt, ask yourself what Al Pacino would do.  Now, doesn't that clear things up?Overall, this movie isn't just terrible, but I'm not recommending you all rush out and spend $7 or $10 or whatever it costs these days to glimpse the magic of film at your local theatre.  Anyway, when you get the chance, rent it, snuggle up on the couch one dark night, and enjoy.",2,"DON'T SAY A WORD Doesn't Say, ""Buy My Today!""",1077840000,"02 27, 2004",2004,3450,"['DO', ""N'T"", 'SAY', 'A', 'WORD', 'should', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'movie', 'probably', 'was', 'first', 'couple', 'hundred', 'times', 'saw', 'movie', 'hodge-podge', 'collection', 'other', 'films', 'rolled', 'one', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'SAY', 'A', 'WORD', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'say', 'jack', 'see', 'right', 'call', 'superficial', 'ending', 'mile', 'off', 'realize', 'crazy', 'chick', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'job', 'scare', 'hooey', 'should.I', 'rolled', 'flick', 'expecting', 'quite', 'bit', 'more', 'simply', 'one', 'desperate', 'father', 'race', 'time', 'save', 'kidnapped', 'daughter', 'clutches', 'bank', 'bandits', 'big', 'grudges', 'who', 'demand', 'father/psychiatrist', 'dig', 'mind', 'seemingly', 'insane', 'teen', 'search', 'single', 'six-digit', 'number', 'God', 'only', 'what', 'kind', 'sick', 'perverse', 'reason', 'should', 'rap', 'up', 'Close', 'friggin', 'book', 'popcorn', 'Eat', 'sandwich', 'Turn', 'off', 'TV', 'Kiss', 'wife', 'Go', 'back', 'bed.Honestly', 'said', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', ""n't"", 'mean', 'completely', 'reeked', 'had', 'high', 'points', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'BASIC', 'INSTINCT', 'TRAFFIC', 'ROMANCING', 'THE', 'STONE', 'WONDER', 'BOYS', 'always', 'great', 'job', 'matter', 'what', 'role', 'FALLING', 'DOWN', 'was', 'crazy', 'GAME', 'was', 'rich', 'BASIC', 'INSTINCT', 'was', 'pleasured', 'film', 'did', 'job', 'well', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'SAY', 'A', 'WORD', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', 'bad', 'Douglas', 'Dr.', 'Nathan', 'Conrad', 'father', 'mentioned', 'already', 'know', 'role', 'scheme', 'things', 'choose', 'not', 'go', 'further', 'acting', 'intense', 'concerned', 'father', 'would', 'act', 'irrational', 'desperate', 'super-stressed', 'etc.One', 'nice', 'thing', 'antagonist', 'film', 'can', 'almost', 'feel', 'sorry', 'times', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'PATRIOT', 'GAMES', 'RONIN', 'PATRICK', 'COSTER', 'thief', 'who', 'roasted', 'buddies', 'initial', 'intense', 'bank-heist', 'opener', 'P.S', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'heist', 'movie', 'history', 'title', 'would', 'be', 'reserved', 'HEAT', 'maybe', 'GETAWAY', 'Bean', 'certainly', 'memorable', 'villain', 'believe', 'when', 'kill', 'someone.Famke', 'Janssen', 'X-MEN', 'ROUNDERS', 'around', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'sex-appeal', 'mom', 'Aggie', 'Conrad', 'Moms', 'are', 'not', 'attractive', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'talk', ""'ve"", 'had', 'enough.Our', 'little', 'lost', 'girl', 'Skye', 'McCole', 'Bartusiak', 'THE', 'PATRIOT', 'RIDING', 'IN', 'CARS', 'WITH', 'BOYS', 'quite', 'bit', 'more', 'flick', 'chose', 'THE', 'PATRIOT', 'JESSIE', 'CONRAD', 'actually', 'talks', 'too', 'awful', 'much.Brittany', 'Murphy', 'GIRL', 'INTERRUPTED', '8-MILE', 'disappointing', 'ELIZABETH', 'BURROWS', 'When', 'play', 'nut', 'need', 'act', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'insane', 'play', 'someone', 'who', 'just', 'extremely', 'talented', 'acting', 'crazy', 'i.e', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'Aaron/Roy', 'PRIMAL', 'FEAR', 'need', 'act', 'friggin', 'genius', 'not', 'make', 'stupid', 'moves', 'One', 'more', 'addition', 'are', 'going', 'play', 'stubborn', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'probing', 'doctor', 'anything', 'more', '45', 'minutes', 'remaining', 'film', 'are', 'rules', 'live', 'Be', 'crazy', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'genius', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'obstinate', 'quit', 'wasting', 'time', 'When', 'doubt', 'ask', 'what', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'would', 'do', 'Now', ""n't"", 'clear', 'things', 'up', 'Overall', 'movie', ""n't"", 'just', 'terrible', ""'m"", 'not', 'recommending', 'rush', 'out', 'spend', '7', '10', 'days', 'glimpse', 'magic', 'film', 'local', 'theatre', 'Anyway', 'when', 'get', 'chance', 'rent', 'up', 'couch', 'one', 'dark', 'night', 'enjoy']",N/A

586770,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JKIV,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","When all is said and done, `Don't Say a Word' works.  It may not knock it out of the park, and you certainly won't be writing home to mother telling her that you've seen the greatest movie you've seen in your whole life; but even to that extent, you won't be thinking about this long enough to call your mother...and yet it's still a good flick and one that wouldn't be wasted on the viewer.Like many have mentioned (non as eloquently as Jeffrey Ellis), this film is very `by the numbers' and sometimes that is exactly what you want to see.  You don't need to think too hard with this one, and while the plot may become tired towards the end, it all works in the generalities it has created for itself.The film circles a moment in the life of Dr. Nathan R. Conrad, a psychiatrist whose life is flipped upside down when some creep kidnaps his daughter and demands that Conrad coerce a young patient to relay a number she has locked up in her head.  The problem is that this patient is very disturbed and getting her to open up is a struggle.Without the performances so in-tune with one another, this film would have lost interest fast, but Michael Douglas, Sean Bean, Brittany Murphy, Jennifer Esposito and Famka Janssen all pull their weight and then some here.  As has been noted, certain members of cast seem to be recycling variations of previous characters (especially Sean Bean, who is too good of an actor to be typecast so vigorously) but they all play their roles respectfully and at times even beautifully.  The late Brittany Murphy showed her range here, delving into the lunacy of her character with a vulnerable endearment.  It isn't as layered as her remarkable work in `Girl, Interrupted', but it works very well within the constraints of the film.Yes, `Don't Say a Word' can at times appear one-note in construction.  We all know who everyone is entirely the minute we see them and so the layers of a character that make them so interesting is missing, and the mystery surrounding the film doesn't seem so startling, but despite the flaws the film is still enjoyable and entertaining.Go ahead and watch it.",3,Hush...,1300320000,"03 17, 2011",2011,2121,"['When', 'said', 'done', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Say', 'Word', 'works', 'may', 'not', 'knock', 'park', 'certainly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'writing', 'home', 'mother', 'telling', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'greatest', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'whole', 'life', 'even', 'extent', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'thinking', 'long', 'enough', 'call', 'mother', 'yet', 'still', 'good', 'flick', 'one', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'wasted', 'viewer.Like', 'many', 'have', 'mentioned', 'non', 'as', 'eloquently', 'Jeffrey', 'Ellis', 'film', 'very', 'numbers', 'sometimes', 'exactly', 'what', 'want', 'see', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'think', 'too', 'hard', 'one', 'plot', 'may', 'become', 'tired', 'end', 'generalities', 'created', 'itself.The', 'film', 'moment', 'life', 'Dr.', 'Nathan', 'R.', 'Conrad', 'psychiatrist', 'life', 'flipped', 'upside', 'down', 'when', 'creep', 'kidnaps', 'daughter', 'demands', 'Conrad', 'coerce', 'young', 'patient', 'relay', 'number', 'locked', 'up', 'head', 'problem', 'patient', 'very', 'disturbed', 'getting', 'open', 'up', 'struggle.Without', 'performances', 'so', 'in-tune', 'one', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'lost', 'interest', 'fast', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'Jennifer', 'Esposito', 'Famka', 'Janssen', 'pull', 'weight', 'then', 'here', 'As', 'been', 'noted', 'certain', 'members', 'cast', 'seem', 'be', 'recycling', 'variations', 'previous', 'characters', 'especially', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'who', 'too', 'good', 'actor', 'be', 'typecast', 'so', 'vigorously', 'play', 'roles', 'respectfully', 'times', 'even', 'beautifully', 'late', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'showed', 'range', 'here', 'delving', 'lunacy', 'character', 'vulnerable', 'endearment', ""n't"", 'as', 'layered', 'remarkable', 'work', 'Girl', 'Interrupted', 'very', 'well', 'constraints', 'film.Yes', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Say', 'Word', 'can', 'times', 'appear', 'one-note', 'construction', 'know', 'who', 'everyone', 'entirely', 'minute', 'see', 'so', 'layers', 'character', 'make', 'interesting', 'missing', 'mystery', 'surrounding', 'film', ""n't"", 'seem', 'so', 'startling', 'flaws', 'film', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'entertaining.Go', 'ahead', 'watch']",N/A

Douglas is also superb in his portrayal of a psychiatrist determined to unlock the secrets to this tortured young woman's soul, but who gets locked in the grip of things he neither appreciates nor understands in the process. As a result, both of the two characters walk emotional and rational tightropes in trying to see this through to the conclusion.The visual effects surrounding the ordeal of the two main characters are both provocative and intriguing, and one senses the attempt on the part of the director to focus us into the evolving and progressive nature of their interior feelings through the kinds of synthetic environments they crash through on their way to the conclusion.  Parts of the movie don't make a great deal of sense, and the plot is so complex and convoluted one wonders why they keep running, yet the production values and the acting are good enough to continue suspending one's critical faculties long enough to see what happens.As a surrealistic thriller this is only fair, but as an absorbing character study of the two main protagonists, it is entertaining enough and interesting enough to make you want to watch this movie.

We've seen him do it in ""Wall Street"", ""A Perfet Murder"", and ""The Game"". Well, he's back at it again. I guess you can't deny a guy for doing something he does so well. Douglas plays Nathan Conrad, a very well respected New York Psychiatrist. He has a cute daughter, and a pretty wife who is holed up in bed with a broken leg. Things get nasty when a an ex-con named Patrick(Sean Bean)kidnaps Douglas' daughter. It seems he needs Douglas' services as a psychiatrist to get thru to a mentally troubled teen named Elizabeth(wonderfully played by Brittany Murphy). This girl holds the key to a where a prized jewel is hidden. Patrick had killed Elizabeth's father right in front of her when she was just a little girl. Director Gary Fleder(""Kiss The Girls"")films his movie very predictably. It's routine and by the numbers. The saving grace to this film is the climax that takes place in an old, rickety cemetary. The script is basic and the plot points can be seen a mile away. We've seen this a few hundred times already. Fleder does nothing to give the movie a more stand out feel to it. Adds nothing. It seems as if he is phone calling in his job. The actors fare so much better here than the film. They all make it watchable. Douglas can do no wrong when it comes to being the uppity uppity guy who finds himself in trouble. He's made it interesting and watchable in the past, and he does it again here. Famke Janssen as his wife, is pretty much left nothing to do but lay in bed and look worried. She is given nothing to really do. What a waste. Reliable veteran actor Oliver Platt is in the same category as Famke. He is given a nothing character and has nowhere to go with it. It just flounders there. His character is typical and we know where it's gonna go. Sean Bean is one of the saving graces. The guy can do a convincing bad guy. Good job. Then there is Brittany Murphy. There is no doubt that she is a fine actress and will one day be even better. I had no idea when I first saw her in ""Clueless"" that she would be where she is now. She is very real and convincing as the troubled teen. She is the best thing this movie has going for it. She does a great job and is very cute to boot, even when she looks and acts crazy. All in all, I expected so much better. The preview looked really good and made this movie look a lot better than it actually is.

Michael Douglas gives an above average performance. Douglas is a great actor, but his greatness and talent is only reached in suduction suspense films like Basic Instinct and Fatal Attraction or urban dramas like Traffic. All this movie is, is the old worn out ransom story with new ideas and an unusual twist of character development and a flashback type theme. Douglas is a psychiatrist with a beautiful wife and a lovely daughter. On Thanksgiving night he's called in by a friend in the field to talk to a young woman who has just viciously attacked someone and has been in and out of institutions and has along list of mental problems. He has no luck and leaves for home. The next day he wakes up to find...yes, of course, his daughter is missing. Shortly after he is called by the kidnappers. The unusual part is that they don't want 100 million dollars or etc. They want a six digit code that's locked away in the young pacients head.

""Don't say a word"" is not one of those few.Michael seems bored out of his mind, at some points I&#8217;m sure he's thinking ""Just looked shocked and think about that fat studio paycheck"". Sean Bean has played some pretty cool and effective villains (""Goldeneye"" and ""Patriot Games"") but here he plays it more as a parody. He isn't scary or threatening for a second, and as for his gang.. Well all I can say is if I were a betting man I&#8217;d put my money on Douglas. Since when does a scary group of criminals need a comic relief character, what was up with that.. Honestly.The one stand out performance wise is Brittany Murphy, much like Angelina Jolie did with ""Tomb Raider"", Brittany gives her while the rest of the cast turn up to get paid. She holds the rapidly falling apart film together as well as she can, but that is a feat beyond the means of a mere mortal.While the supporting cast is filled with known names and faces, (Famke Janssen, Oliver Platt and Jennifer Esposito) none of them make any real impact. Famke and Jennifer fare a little better, so by my count, the guys in this film are really letting the team down.My main problem with the film is the way that it tries to be many sorts of thrillers, in fact, each character seems to inhabit their own mini-thriller. Michael is in one (say, ""Ransom""), Brittany is in another (""Mercury Rising""), as are Sean (""Home Alone"".. That may be taking it a bit far), Famke (""The Bone Collector"") and Jennifer (just about every thriller ever made, and since when are detectives so drop dead gorgeous).Sure, it kills two hours and Brittany Murphy is great, hence the two star rating, but if you expect more, prepare to be bitterly disappointed.

586789,A3KOVFORKXQ2U9,B00005JKIV,Daniel McInnis,"[1, 6]","If you go into Don't Say a Word expecting another Fatal Attraction or, to a lesser extent a Basic Instinct, you'll be disappointed to know that it's little more than a Kiss the Girls/A Perfect Murder wannabe.  The contrived plot finds Michael Douglas as an uptown NYC psychatrist (real stretch, huh) forced into treating a mental patient with a two million dollar number in her head.  This after his picture-esque Norman Rockwell-type family is uprooted by the kidnapping of his nine-year-old daughter.It's during this twenty minute set-up where the film really lost me.  Director Gary Fleder tries to establish Douglas and co. as the ideallic middle-to-upper class family, and thus envoke sympathy for them.  Instead they come off so sickingly sweet that you're almost rooting for the bad guys to deliver them a healthy dose of stern reality.  The biggest problem with this, though, is that Sean Bean, as the mastermind of a jewel heist and the subsequnt kidnapping, is so bland that he hardly evokes any kind of reaction at all.So we're left watching Douglas jump through hoops, ala Die Hard with a Vengeance, and I still haven't even mentioned Britney Murphy who delivers the kind of over-the-top performance that usually wins supporting actor Oscars (this isn't a compliment).  For anyone who's seem the trailer, the only comforting bit of information I can offer you is that her now infamous ""I'll never tell"" line comes early in the film and is all but forgiven (if not forgotten) by movie's end.Bad acting must be contagious too, because she isn't even half as bad as Famke Janssen or Jennifer Esposito, both trying their hands at roles which exceed their grasp. In fact Janssen's so horrendous (as usual) that I couldn't help but hope she'd be killed off before any real acting would be required of her.  And no one is spared the bug, not even Michael Douglas, who seems to have fallen into Arnold Schwarzenegger mode with psychological thrillers, recycling stories & characters just to make a quick buck.",2,Don't See This Movie,1016668800,"03 21, 2002",2002,2013,"['go', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Say', 'Word', 'expecting', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'lesser', 'extent', 'Basic', 'Instinct', ""'ll"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'know', 'little', 'more', 'Kiss', 'Girls/A', 'Perfect', 'Murder', 'wannabe', 'contrived', 'plot', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'uptown', 'NYC', 'psychatrist', 'real', 'stretch', 'huh', 'forced', 'treating', 'mental', 'patient', 'two', 'million', 'dollar', 'number', 'head', 'picture-esque', 'Norman', 'Rockwell-type', 'family', 'uprooted', 'kidnapping', 'nine-year-old', 'daughter.It', 'twenty', 'minute', 'set-up', 'where', 'film', 'really', 'lost', 'Director', 'Gary', 'Fleder', 'establish', 'Douglas', 'co.', 'ideallic', 'middle-to-upper', 'class', 'family', 'thus', 'envoke', 'sympathy', 'Instead', 'come', 'so', 'sickingly', 'sweet', ""'re"", 'almost', 'rooting', 'bad', 'guys', 'deliver', 'healthy', 'dose', 'stern', 'reality', 'biggest', 'problem', 'though', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'mastermind', 'jewel', 'heist', 'subsequnt', 'kidnapping', 'so', 'bland', 'hardly', 'kind', 'reaction', 'all.So', ""'re"", 'left', 'watching', 'Douglas', 'jump', 'hoops', 'ala', 'Die', 'Hard', 'Vengeance', 'still', 'have', ""n't"", 'even', 'mentioned', 'Britney', 'Murphy', 'who', 'kind', 'over-the-top', 'performance', 'usually', 'supporting', 'actor', 'Oscars', ""n't"", 'compliment', 'anyone', 'who', 'seem', 'trailer', 'only', 'comforting', 'bit', 'information', 'can', 'offer', 'now', 'infamous', ""'ll"", 'never', 'tell', 'line', 'early', 'film', 'forgiven', 'not', 'forgotten', 'movie', 'end.Bad', 'acting', 'must', 'be', 'contagious', 'too', ""n't"", 'even', 'half', 'as', 'bad', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'Jennifer', 'Esposito', 'trying', 'hands', 'roles', 'exceed', 'grasp', 'fact', 'Janssen', 'so', 'horrendous', 'usual', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'hope', ""'d"", 'be', 'killed', 'off', 'real', 'acting', 'would', 'be', 'required', 'one', 'spared', 'bug', 'not', 'even', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'who', 'have', 'fallen', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'mode', 'psychological', 'thrillers', 'recycling', 'stories', 'characters', 'just', 'make', 'quick', 'buck']",N/A

586795,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B00005JKIV,Dennis Littrell,"[9, 15]","I think the rule for a Michael Douglas film has to be if he plays a bad guy (as in, for example, A Perfect Murder 1998) or when the film's director has enough prestige to actually direct Douglas (e.g., Traffic 2000 directed by Steven Soderbergh) the movie might be worth watching, otherwise forget it.  Here Douglas is Dr. Nathan Conrad, god's gift to psychiatry and the good life, with a beautiful wife, a darling eight-year-old daughter, an opulently-decorated apartment, and a thriving practice--so much so he does some ""pro bono"" shrinking.  In short he is an all-around good guy, fabulously successful, admired by all.Of course in a movie these fantasy-world advantages might be a little hard to overcome.  Usually heroes like this are the sort of pablum fed to artistically unsophisticated middle-aged execs so that they will have something to fall asleep to in front of their hotel room TV.  I think this would have worked better if Douglas's character were a little compromised, maybe make him a womanizer or somebody who abuses his practice or at least cheats on his income taxes.The subject of his pro bono work is the catatonic Elisabeth Burrows played fetchingly by Brittany Murphy.  In addition to being catatonic she is also quick with the multiple personalities and can job the shrinks to distraction.  Enter the complication: the girl holds some numbers in her head that some crooks want.  They give Conrad until five p.m. to shrink it out of her or they will kill his daughter whom they have kidnaped.  Right, this could happen.  Meanwhile they have magically installed cameras in Conrad's apartment and at the asylum lock-up, god only knows how.  Furthermore, Conrad's wife (Skye McCole Bartusiak) is temporarily bed-ridden because of a skiing accident.  Every time either she or Conrad makes a move a phone rings and it is the bad guys (led by Sean Bean) on the other end saying Big Brother is watching and if you don't behave we will kill your daughter.Aside from the absurdities of the premise, there is the direction by Gary Fleder to consider.  He might have made a passable made-for-TV kind of production if he had just played it straight, but no, he wanted to be creative (like Christopher Nolan of Memento fame, perhaps) and so chopped up the time sequence.  Perhaps this was an attempt to camouflage the fatuous plot.  No doubt Fleder and the clueless producers liked this because it allowed them to begin the movie with an inane action/adventure scene including a fire-balled vehicle and some ""authentic"" football-betting talk.  After about twenty minutes of ""Huh?"" action, Fleder then allows the players to talk the plot and we realize that there are two time lines ten years apart.  No doubt he also reveals how Bartusiak broke her leg, but I didn't stick around for that.Bottom line: there are at least a thousand movies better.

One character is killed pointlessly. Another--a cop--is kept so far away from the action that she doesn't even have an impact on the story. A brutal deadline is set...for no apparent reason. And, finally, the enigmatic 6-digit number locked in Elisabeth's head could just as easily be found at the hall of records.In other words, there is no reason for this movie--a tiny tug on any one of these frayed plot threads unravels the movie in moments.But there are other movies with equally threadbare plots that fare better than DSAW...so why does this one fall flat for me?Well, as indicated, there's the Michael Douglas factor--if, like me, you find him smug and annoying, well, you'll get another dose of the same, here.

586799,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00005JKIV,D. Litton,"[5, 6]","Originality doesn't exactly seem to the director Gary Fleder's strong suit in ""Don't Say A Word,"" which puts actor Michael Douglas in a comfort zone as a father whose family is put in jeopardy by someone out for something he holds the key to. As far as thrillers go these days, the film takes us right where we know it's going to go, but it's well-made, with terrific performances from Douglas and the rest of the cast, and a director whose competency in the genre is in full vigor.The story is adapted from the novel by Andrew Klavan, and begins by introducing us to a heist situation that goes sour. Moving ahead ten years, we meet Dr. Nathan Conrad (Michael Douglas), an adolescent psychologist known for his success with troubled teens. On the morning of Thanksgiving Day, he discovers his daughter has been kidnapped, held by the men seen in the opening scene who are demanding a piece of information tucked away in the mind of Nathan's newest patient, an 18-year-old catatonic.As far as these situations go, Nathan finds himself in a tight spot. The kidnappers are able to keep watch over his apartment, leaving him little room for thwarting their demands. His wife, Aggie (Famke Janssen), is bedridden due to a skiing accident, virtually leaving her in harm's way when he ventures back to the hospital to question the easily-unsettled Elisabeth (Brittany Murphy).Like most thrillers, there are some technical issues concerning minor plot points, many of which are easily overlooked. There's the question of how the kidnappers were able to set up surveillance on the Conrads with such ease, or how, despite the amount of security surrounding Elisabeth, they were able to plant a bug in her hospital room. These assumptions to unanswered questions are hardly ignorable, but do not exactly hinder the overall success of the film.Fleder is able to keep things moving very steadily, providing a window of time that keeps us in the moment as Nathan races against the clock to progressively unlock the haunting memories in Elisabeth's subconscious. Not only that, but we are also given some well-constructed scenes between kidnapper and kidnappee, as well as some plot provided to the injured Aggie. The subplot involving a female cop played by Jennifer Esposito is a basic throwaway twist, but it fits in with the material nicely.Once again, Douglas is at the top of his game, recalling his family instinct from ""Fatal Attraction"" and his drive for answers from ""Basic Instinct,"" and fitting them into his character's father status.

I also like Bean's work and so I thought why not see what is happening in this one.With the opening sequence I thought I might have made a good choice. Then the screen says that it is now 10 years later and we see Dr. Nathan Conrad on his way home from work. After he chats with his wife about their turkey the next day, which is Thanksgiving, he receives another call from the lockup from a fellow shrink.This is where things start to go wrong. First of all, when he sits down with Elizabeth, who has been in psyche lockup for the past 10 years, he immediately is taken by how she is not presenting with diagnosis from past or present. That is our first clue that things are not exactly as the other shrink indicates. Then it really gets messed up. The following morning his daughter has been abducted and the race starts. First of all, I am going to assume that 'you have till 5&quot; is only for control purpose by Patrick or is it because the red diamond, which I assume also is a diamond because a red ruby that size would not be worth $10 million in any gem shop.....is going to self destruct because it is has been 10 years of searching for it? Who knows. We are also lead to believe that the entire apartment is bugged in less than one day? with his wife flat on her back with a cast on her leg all the time it is being bugged? Did she not think it odd that someone was bugging it? And many other things that do not add up. Meanwhile, they have dragged a body from the river and we now have a detective trying to sort out the missing woman. In the end the doctor determines that he must get Elizabeth out of lockup so they can now go to where it all happened. When they show in slow flashbacks what happened 10 years before in the subway, we see her father pushed down in the tracks and then ultimately stumbles directly into the path of the oncoming train. And most importantly the three who did this, and who are still after her now, were apparently arrested by the platform police at the time. There were apparently many onlookers when it happened. So why are they free? Are we lead to believe the police just released them and told them not push anybody else in the path of a train?Finally when he figures it out where the doll is, that contains the ruby, he receives yet another call from Patrick who tells him he has three minutes? And the doctor tells him he has the item and no more clock running. That is what I would have told him to begin with. When Patrick asks where he says &quot;You know&quot;. Well if he knew all along why didn't he just go get it?Bottomline is that it lays an egg all the way thru.I give Douglas and Bean credit for sticking it out.

Firstly you have the bad guys, who are in a spot of bother after years of trying to change the past.  You have the family of the Conrad's, which is important for viewers to try and be close too.  Then the relationship between Nathan Conrad (Douglas) and Elisabeth (Murphy), which is of most importance to the whole story.

Their mind games were the core of the story, with the murders in the movie just an excuse for them to match wits.&quot;Don't Say a Word&quot; is a decent movie, but it needs more of this interraction.  The plot, basically, is that psychiatrist Michael Douglas has to pry a number out of a patient in a mental instituion.  His incentive to do this is that his daughter has been kidnapped by the crooks who wish to know this, and if he doesn't produce, it's bye-bye little girl.The problem is, the patient doesn't want to reveal this number to anyone.  As the movie unfolds, we start to understand why this is.  The reasons for this make for a pretty good plot, and the chemistry between Douglas, and the patient (Brittany Murphy) is excellent.Problem is, there isn't enough of it.  While it's nice to know some background before these encounters, the movie spends way too much time showing a bank heist, the booty from which drives the need to get the number.

586808,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00005JKIV,"""flickjunkie""","[2, 3]","An implausible plot turns absurd by the end in this psychological thriller.  Strong performances and good production values can't redeem a storyline that asks us not only to suspend disbelief, but to relinquish our notions of reality.  That is all well and good for fantasy or sci-fi offerings, but this film purports to be a serious psychological drama in the Hitchcock tradition, and in that regard it is sorely lacking.Plot holes abound and the psychological aspect is glossed over.  Other than Dr. Conrad (Michael Douglas) and Elizabeth (Brittany Murphy) there isn't much character development.  I have to give director Gary Fleder credit for a fine job with the look and feel of the film.  With this film, Fleder has broken out of his predominantly TV resume to show that he has the ability to play in this league.  Fleder has a good sense for what makes a scene suspenseful.  His use of the camera is excellent, giving us some interesting first person perspectives in addition to scenes that are generally well prepared.  The sets are realistic (especially the Montreal subway station that was turned into the Canal Street station in New York) and well constructed for suspense with lots of places for tight, cramped shots that turn up the psychological pressure.  However, Fleder seems so intent on bringing us a technically well crafted film, that he misses the fact that his story is leaving the galaxy.Michael Douglas gives his typical fine performance; smart, tough and stubborn with a soft side.  However, the real story in this film is Brittany Murphy.  Murphy delivered an excellent performance in ""Girl Interrupted"" and then bounced around in a number of minor roles in minor films until landing this part.  Here Murphy cranks it up about tenfold as the disturbed, but brilliant young woman who has a secret locked in her head.  She walks a fine line between sanity and derangement and slips in and out so easily that it is frighteningly convincing.

586811,AGQ8TQ8U3KG19,B00005JKIV,"""goodboygonebadd""","[10, 11]","I read a couple of negative reviews of DON'T SAY A WORD when it first came out.  I have to wonder if we saw the same movie.  I think too many people over-analyze thrillers, instead of allowing themselves to be entertained.  More than any other genre, thrillers rely on your visceral reaction to what's going on, not the logical.  Don't get me wrong, logic is important to thrillers, otherwise they're not believable.  But after a certain point, you should just let the film entertain you.  DON'T SAY A WORD does just that.Michael Douglas plays a celebrated child psychiatrist married to a gorgeous amazon (the talented and underrated Famke Janssen, easily the most beautiful woman in the world), with a six-year old daughter (Sky Cole Bartusiak) who, unlike most child characters in thrillers, is not irritating and cloying.  Anyhow, the family's thanksgiving plan are disrupted when the munchkin is abducted in the middle of the night by a gang of jewel thieves (led by the equally talented and underrated Sean Bean).  Turns out they need the good doctor to coax out some information from a ""schizophrenic"" patient (the terrific Brittany Murphy) by the end of the day, or daughter goes bye-bye.The rest of the flick moves at lightning speed as Dr. Conrad races against time to get the information from the girl.  Parallel storylines involving a tough cop (Jennifer Esposito, easily the second most beautiful woman in the world after Famke)who inadverdently finds herself on the trail of the thieves, and Famke Janssen trapped in her apartment because of ber broken leg lend fuel to this already brightly-burning fire of a movie.  Best sequence involves intercutting of Jennifer chasing Michael and Brittany, and Famke fighting off a murderous assassin despite her cast.  Speaking of Famke's sequence, never before have I cheered when a bad guy got what was coming to him.  Moral of the story?  A desperate mother will still kick your [butt], leg cast or not.  All in all, there never is any doubt about how this movie will all end, but getting there is a thrill ride from hell.  Which is what a thriller should aspire to be.

Even so, the performances are so good and the editing so quickly paced that the film still pays off for those who are willing to suspend their disbelief.  Michael Douglas is a noted psychiatrist who is under pressure to unlock a long-buried secret from a patient's mind within 24 hours to save his young daughter who's been kidnapped on the day before Thanksgiving by a desperate gang of criminals just released from jail who killed the patient's father 10 years ago when he double-crossed them during a high profile robbery and who are now following Douglas' every move having bugged his home with secreted cameras while his wife lies helpless in bed with a broken leg she sustained in a recent skiing accident ... oh, never mind, you get the idea.Douglas is great, playing his character with that on-the-edge, about-to-snap tension he's practically patented in film.  Brittany Murphy is even better in the showy part of the psychiatric patient whose demeanor wavers between simmering aggressor and traumatized victim.  The rest of the cast lends able support in their fairly stereotypical roles (the ruthless gang mastermind; the dedicated lady detective; the crusty police veteran with a heart of gold; the sweet but plucky kidnapped daughter, etc.).  Oliver Platt's turn as a smarmy colleague of Douglas' especially stand outs.The DVD offers an anamorphic widescreen film-to-video transfer that is wonderfully sharp, and the sound transfer is of equally high quality.  There are loads of extra features, including deleted scenes, a ""making of"" featurette, and lots more.

Even when his character is entirely different than a character from another of his movies, I still feel like I'm watching the same character.I didn't see this movie in the theatres because I thought the marketing for the movie was ludicrous. I remember thinking, when I saw the ads on buses and television, ""You've got to be kidding me.""But my roommate convinced me that it was actually a decent film, so we rented it. I don't know if this was a faithful rendering of the book, but the movie itself was formulaic and predictable, from Platt's role, to the final ending. It also left a number of questions unanswered. How did Murphy's 8 yr old character know which coffin her father was in? Unless I missed something huge, that would have to be one incredibly talented child. Also, how exactly did Bean's character know that there was a six digit number stored in this girl's brain? We can surmise that he read the newspaper article that said that the girl was found wandering around on Hart island, and from that he assumed that she knew - but that's still an assumption, and a broad one at that.There are some action devices employed in film that I have grown vomitous over, and a few are used here. (They shouldn't be, given that this was supposed to be a taut thriller.) Douglas steals a cell phone from an innocent citizen, when all he had to do was refuse to answer his own phone when the bad guys called him, and then he steals a boat, when perhaps some of his $200 an hour salary would have greased the boat owner's palms. Besides, how did he start the boat? I might have had my head turned, but dang, these guys that steal boats in movies have some amazing skills that you wouldn't think they possess.The detective in the film seemed to exist only to fire a few shots at the end and give Douglas's character a chance at survival. Her acting was abysmal, and the scene with Platt's character was disastrous. Not to mention why the aforementioned bad guys broke their word to him regarding his girlfriend. That made NO sense whatsoever - and what made even less sense is that the broken word plot point was dropped right there. It didn't go any further. We never found out why.This would get a 2 but for one thing: Brittany Murphy.

On the DVD is Brittany Murphy's audition, which is nothing less than searing; some of the most powerful acting I have ever seen.  Even if you don't watch the movie, watch the audition.  The audition performance is considerably more intense than the same scene in the movie because it has no cuts, no breaks.  It is just one 5 minute long take.  It is like going 5 minutes without blinking.  Powerful stuff.  One can envision the producers getting the funding to complete the movie on the basis of this audition alone.Actually all the actors are very good, Michael Douglas, Famke Janssen, who plays Michael Douglas's wife and Skye McCole Bartusiak who is their daughter are all attractive and winning.  Skye McCole Bartusiak as the daughter deserves special note as she imbues that role with a sweet intelligence.  The good guys are attractive and we care about them.  Sean Bean, the bad guy, has a scary intensity sort similar to Robert Shaw of Jaws fame.The problem with Don't Say a Word is its plot.  Sean Bean's character is both a mad dog killer and a cool, calculating criminal mastermind.  On the one hand, Bean kills the one man who can tell him where to find what he is looking for ... on a subway platform in front of dozens of witnesses.  (Talk about a dumb move!)  On the other he plans a split-second bank heist of considerable complexity.  On the one hand he kills a kidnap victim while the ransomer (Oliver Platt) has yet to do what Bean wants.  (Bean was bored?  Didn't care?  Who knows?)  On the other he plots another complex kidnapping and manipulation of the Michael Douglas character.  Add this to other characters acting particularly stupid (Jennifer Esposito plays a cop who does not believe in calling for backup until it is too late for the backup to come in a timely manner/ do any good.) and the movie loses us as it piles improbability on improbability.

Perhaps you don't like thrillers or find Michael Douglas past his Fatal Attraction prime. You do, however, know one thing about director Gary Fleder's tale: ""I'll never tell.""I'm sure you know someone who imitates Brittany Murphy's haunting chirp; perhaps you do a good one yourself. Don't Say A Word is much more than a Murphy romp, but its not as much as it could be.Michael Douglas (Wall Street) leads a fine cast as Dr. Nathan Conrad, a psychiatrist with a flare for helping troubled young folk. His wife Aggie (Famke Janssen, X-Men) is laid up at the Conrad's posh townhouse with a broken leg and daughter Jessie (Skye McCole Bartusiak, 24). All seems just peachy until Dr. Conrad receives an emergency call on Thanksgiving Eve. Dr. Louis Sachs (Oliver Platt, The West Wing) needs Nathan's insights on a new patient, Elisabeth Burrows (Brittany Murphy, Sin City). After his initial visit with Elisabeth, the holiday morning seems grand-until the Conrads discover Jessie has been abducted during the night. Jewel thief turned kidnapper Patrick Koster (Sean Bean, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring) calls Dr. Conrad with his demands; Get the number locked inside Elisabeth's troubled mind or Jessie is dead.Based on the novel by Andrew Klavan with a screenplay from Anthony Peckham and Patrick Smith Kelly (A Perfect Murder), Don't Say A Word certainly has an intriguing premise. The opening robbery scene and subsequent patient and family sets establish who everyone is and what is happening. The suspense and food for thought comes in the unanswered why. How did Koster come to Nathan? What is the number? The direction from Fleder (Kiss the Girls) and the performances onscreen are realistic and well played. It's tough to have an action opening followed by seemingly random looks into a New York family's life, but it works here. We are invested in these people's dilemmas. We want answers and resolution.Michael Douglas is on form as the sympathetic yet intelligent Dr. Conrad. At first we might find him uppity and smug-Nathan has left the down trodden psychiatric hospital for uptown and lucrative psychiatry. Oddly enough, you are rooting more for the opening heist. You want the double cross on Koster to succeed. Seeing how Dr. Conrad and his family get caught in Koster's revenge scheme instantly makes the determined father likeable. Douglas often plays the Fonda-type innocent and wronged man with roles like The Game and more recently the elderly comedy The In-Laws; a remake co starring dad Kirk Douglas. We know he'll do what needs to be done, and we believe his motivation.Perhaps more intriguing is Famke Janssen as Aggie, the bed bound wife. When Koster is spying on her and carrying on glib phone conversations, you feel every bit for Aggie's pain, helplessness, and fear for herself and her abducted daughter. It's bemusing to see Janssen and Sean Bean on opposite sides since they were so delicious as the evil duo in Goldeneye. The turnabout makes Koster seem even more dubious, and you really want Aggie to do something about it. But what can she do? Not just a pretty face, Janssen sells what could be very claustrophobic and still scenes with real tears, intense stares, angry fidgets, and subtle movements. Untraditional camera angles also work in Aggie's storyline. She may not move, but the camera does. Likewise the cuts to Sean Bean as Koster on the phone expand Aggie's space.Often typecast as the villain courtesy of his vile roles in Patriot Games and Essex Boys, Bean is creepy as ever in Don't Say A Word. We've seen his villainy before, but American audiences may not be as familiar with Bean's voice, unlike his popular narration, commercial, and voice over work in the UK. His delivery for Koster is perfectly vile and suave. Every time Koster calls Dr. Conrad, you know who's in control.Strangely, Brittany Murphy doesn't have much to do beyond the ticks and chants of the stereotypical crazy person on film. Bartusiak's Jessie is cute enough, but the strength of these characters is raised by the three leads. The Conrads want their daughter, Nathan reaches out to Elisabeth like a father to a daughter, and both the younger girls are very important to Koster and his schemes.I would like to have seen more of the authorities' storyline. Jennifer Esposito's Detective Cassidy is always one step behind. It's a shame her scenes aren't given more weight to parallel the main focuses. Yes, another thread to conclude may not always be a good thing, but somewhere halfway through Don't Say A Word, things get a little obvious. The intelligent layers peel down to other stereotypical themes. It turns out Elisabeth isn't all that troubled after all, everyone has their rah rah moment and then it's time to move onto Thanksgiving Dinner. For all the fine performances and mature set up in Don't Say A Word, the end wraps up almost too nicely. I liked Don't Say A Word and am still recommending it to intelligent audiences, but intrigued viewers must look to the DVD features for more in depth scenes and analysis. Cast and director commentaries, storyboards, and deleted scenes give some fulfillment.Don't Say A Word is an intelligent and well acted film when such movies are tough to find. Repeat watching may not be in the cards, but any thinking person audience should tune in.",3,Speaks too little,1229299200,"12 15, 2008",2008,5377,"['Maybe', ""'ve"", 'seen', '2001', 'Do', ""n't"",

When we travel, for example, we say to each other and to ourselves, ""Don't forget to bring the (fill in the blank)!"" When the crew of ""Don't Say a Word"" went on location, someone should have said, ""Don't forget to bring the script!"" Judging from the movie's jumbled mess of a plot, said script must have gone missing. Don't say I didn't warn you.The good news is that the film stars Michael Douglas. Though he's been in all kinds of movies, he's best known for his roles in thrillers, ranging from ""Fatal Attraction"" to ""Basic Instinct"" to ""A Perfect Murder"". Whether he's playing the hero or the villain, he always delights us as he inevitably goes from suave and sophisticated to down and dirty. He's done it so often that there must be some sort of inside joke involved. Even when the thriller is a weak one, we can relax because we know he'll be back, hopefully in a better one.Dr Nathan Conrad [Douglas] is a successful New York City psychiatrist specializing in treating disturbed teenagers. He works in a beautiful office, makes $200 an hour, lives in a fabulous apartment, has the perfect wife and daughter, and drives a Land Rover. [Douglas, the suave and sophisticated, personified!] It's Thanksgiving Eve, always a sign of big trouble ahead in a movie thriller. Conrad is on his way home with the turkey, the unwitting symbol of the movie, when he receives a phone call from an old colleague, Dr. Sachs [Oliver Platt]. The man begs him to come to the mental hospital he runs in order to help a young patient, Elisa [Brittany Murphy], who is having a severe crisis. Crisis is an understatement. Elisa looks like she is trying out for a remake of ""The Exorcist"". She makes no sense [possibly having been thoroughly confused by the script?], and Conrad promises to check on her again in a day or so. He goes home, not knowing what we already have figured out, which is that he won't soon forget this Thanksgiving.Many of the elements of a good Douglas thriller are here - lush photography, well designed sets, properly ominous music, and a good supporting cast, especially Sean Bean as a very nasty villain and Skye McCole Bartosiak as Conrad's young daughter. The script or the lack of one cancels out all of this.Like most recent thrillers, ""Don't Say a Word"" isn't content to start quietly and then build tension. It starts with an explosive bank robbery, which takes place ten years before Conrad's fateful encounter with Elisa. The scene gets our attention, but it also gives us so much information that we spend the rest of the movie way ahead of the characters. To make up for this, director Gary Fleder uses all sort of flashy photography techniques, which are interesting to look at but don't fool us into thinking that what we expect to happen isn't going to happen. Then, there is the matter of Elisa. We find out that she's been in mental institutions since the time of the robbery. We are told she is only pretending to be crazy because she is using hospitals to hide out in. Since she was eight years old, we ask? The character becomes so unbelievable to us that we start looking for other flaws in the story. Here's one: Though her father is officially listed as a John Doe, the girl is seen accompanying two or three men on the ferry carrying his coffin to the island he is buried on. Later, she is found wandering alone on the island, and no one connects her to the burial. What?Eventually, the movie ends with a rather gripping climax. Many viewers, though, will be long gone before it happens.

The movie is full of action and nail-biting suspense.  Michael Douglas plays a successful psychiatrist in private practice who is asked by a colleague to interview a perplexing patient.  The patient, played exquisitely by Brittany Murphy, is perceived as a paranoid schizophrenic by some, delusional by others, a real puzzle to the psychiatric community.  As Dr. Conrad (Douglas) delves into the case, he discovers that Patient Barrows' (Murphy) case isn't as complicated as it seems.  However, his successful attempts to reach the patient have drawn some undesireable attention.  It seems that Conrad's patient has a very important number locked deep inside her disturbed mind and someone is willing to do anything to get that number.  That someone, played by Sean Bean, kidnaps Conrad's daughter and threatens to kill her if Conrad doesn't get the number from Barrows.  Attempts to retrieve the number give us the movie's catch phrase: I'll never tell.Brittany Murphy's performance in this film is nothing short of spectacular.  I work with psychiatric patients and I can honestly say that she gives off a very convincing performance.  Michael Douglas, Sean Bean, and Famke Janssen are also great, but Murphy steals the show in this one.  A very talented actress!While I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, I feel it is only fair to warn you that there are a couple of inconsistancies.  First, there is a scene involving an attack made by Patient Barrows against an orderly in Rockland State.  Well, working at Rockland Psych. Center (which is the only state hospital in Rockland), I can assure you that we have no such thing as an orderly.  Also, some of the scenes in Manhattan are a little off, but you would only notice if you lived out here.  And a warning for those of you who want to see this because you read the book.  Although the basic premise is the same, the story takes a completely different turn.  If you were expecting the same outcome in the movie as the book, you'll be a tad disappointed, but definitely see it anyway - it's well worth it!!!",4,Brittany Murphy Does It Again!,1024358400,"06 18, 2002",2002,2238,"['TV', 'ads', 'movie', 'had', 'made', 'want', 'rush', 'theaters', 'see', 'film', 'alas', 'had', 'wait', 'come', 'out', 'video', 'actually', 'viewing', 'great', 'flick', 'movie', 'full', 'action', 'nail-biting', 'suspense', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'successful', 'psychiatrist', 'private', 'practice', 'who', 'asked', 'colleague', 'interview', 'perplexing', 'patient', 'patient', 'played', 'exquisitely', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'perceived', 'paranoid', 'schizophrenic', 'delusional', 'others', 'real', 'puzzle', 'psychiatric', 'community', 'Dr.', 'Conrad', 'Douglas', 'case', 'Patient', 'Barrows', 'Murphy', 'case', ""n't"", 'as', 'complicated', 'However', 'successful', 'attempts', 'reach', 'patient', 'have', 'drawn', 'undesireable', 'attention', 'Conrad', 'patient', 'very', 'important', 'number', 'locked', 'deep', 'disturbed', 'mind', 'someone', 'willing', 'do', 'anything', 'get', 'number', 'someone', 'played', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'Conrad', 'daughter', 'kill', 'Conrad', ""n't"", 'get', 'number', 'Barrows', 'Attempts', 'retrieve', 'number', 'give', 'movie', 'catch', 'phrase', ""'ll"", 'never', 'tell.Brittany', 'Murphy', 'performance', 'film', 'nothing', 'short', 'spectacular', 'work', 'psychiatric', 'patients', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'very', 'convincing', 'performance', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'Murphy', 'show', 'one', 'very', 'talented', 'actress', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'feel', 'only', 'fair', 'warn', 'are', 'couple', 'inconsistancies', 'First', 'scene', 'involving', 'attack', 'made', 'Patient', 'Barrows', 'orderly', 'Rockland', 'State', 'Well', 'working', 'Rockland', 'Psych', 'Center', 'only', 'state', 'hospital', 'Rockland', 'can', 'assure', 'have', 'such', 'thing', 'orderly', 'Also', 'scenes', 'Manhattan', 'are', 'little', 'off', 'would', 'only', 'notice', 'lived', 'out', 'here', 'warning', 'who', 'want', 'see', 'read', 'book', 'basic', 'premise', 'same', 'story', 'completely', 'different', 'turn', 'were', 'expecting', 'same', 'outcome', 'movie', 'book', ""'ll"", 'be', 'tad', 'disappointed', 'definitely', 'see', 'anyway', 'well', 'worth']",N/A

However, ""Don't Say a Word"" still manages to hold you in suspense, and most of the changes in the movie do not compromise the general plot and feel.Michael Douglas as the forementioned psychiatrist once again provides a sturdy fulcrum for the plot and actors to work from.  Douglas has played this role before, but he still brings an earnest and sincere portrait of a man facing the possible death of his little girl.  Famke Janssen as his injured wife (from a ski accident) isn't given a lot to do, and when she does, she's not the world's best actress, but I liked her in this more than anything else I've seen her in.Sean Bean who was so heroic in the first installment of ""Lord of the Rings"" plays a nicely sinister villain, truly coldhearted and greedy.Of course, the movie's real star turns out to be Brittany Murphy who plays the institutionalized Elizabeth, a young woman who has something the bad guys desperately want; thus the kidnapping of Douglas' daughter.  At first, Murphy seems to be following the typical acting for such a role; however, as her role increases and she becomes more involved, she really does a quite convincing job, and this movie should boost her rising star.Although Jennifer Esposito's role as Detective Cassady is fairly by the book, there's something about her delivery that made me appreciate her performance even more.  Only the predictable Oliver Platt failed to capture the evil that the Doctor had in the book, but he doesn't hurt the movie seriously.All in all, this is a good adaptation of a good book and I enjoyed it.RECOMMENDED.",4,SEALED LIPS AND MORE,1044662400,"02 8, 2003",2003,1743,"['most', 'cases', 'Andrew', 'Klavan', 'book', 'basis', 'movie', 'little', 'more', 'cohesive', 'richer', 'depiction', 'plight', 'Dr.', 'Nathan', 'Conrad', 'However', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Say', 'Word', 'still', 'hold', 'suspense', 'most', 'changes', 'movie', 'do', 'not', 'compromise', 'general', 'plot', 'feel.Michael', 'Douglas', 'forementioned', 'psychiatrist', 'once', 'again', 'sturdy', 'fulcrum', 'plot', 'actors', 'work', 'Douglas', 'played', 'role', 'still', 'earnest', 'sincere', 'portrait', 'man', 'facing', 'possible', 'death', 'little', 'girl', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'injured', 'wife', 'ski', 'accident', ""n't"", 'given', 'lot', 'do', 'when', 'not', 'world', 'best', 'actress', 'liked', 'more', 'anything', 'else', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'in.Sean', 'Bean', 'who', 'was', 'so', 'heroic', 'first', 'installment', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'nicely', 'sinister', 'villain', 'truly', 'coldhearted', 'greedy.Of', 'course', 'movie', 'real', 'star', 'out', 'be', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'who', 'institutionalized', 'Elizabeth', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'something', 'bad', 'guys', 'desperately', 'want', 'thus', 'kidnapping', 'Douglas', 'daughter', 'first', 'Murphy', 'be', 'following', 'typical', 'acting', 'role', 'however', 'role', 'increases', 'more', 'involved', 'really', 'quite', 'convincing', 'job', 'movie', 'should', 'boost', 'rising', 'star.Although', 'Jennifer', 'Esposito', 'role', 'Detective', 'Cassady', 'fairly', 'book', 'something', 'delivery', 'made', 'appreciate', 'performance', 'even', 'more', 'Only', 'predictable', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'failed', 'capture', 'evil', 'Doctor', 'had', 'book', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'movie', 'seriously.All', 'good', 'adaptation', 'good', 'book', 'enjoyed', 'it.RECOMMENDED']",N/A

586844,A1JMQ88IMH0XJL,B00005JKIV,Mike,"[2, 3]","""Don't Say a Word"" (2001)I had high expectations for Don't Say a Word. Not because I wanted to prove all the critics who slammed it wrong, but because the cast looked good and generally I like a good suspense movie. Although I did go into this movie expecting to like it, I came out generally disappointed, and felt that the movie could've been highly improved.I like a good far-fetched fantasy, but for a movie that is supposed to be a believable thriller, I thought this went a bit far. There were countless times when the police could've noticed the villains, and I just couldn't see how the kidnappers had planted all those cameras and listening devices to see every single inch that the characters move and listen to everything. There is a scene when Michael Douglas is talking to Brittany Murphy for a second or third time and the villains are listening to them? Just how could they plant that hearing device into Brittany Murphy's cell? Many scenes are like this one, and the problem is, for the sophisticated thriller it wants to be, Don't Say a Word isn't even remotely believable in some sequences.I also didn't like the story with the cop, played by Jennifer Eposito. Her scenes took up a lot of time and were the most boring parts of the movie. Yes, I know we needed to know about the cop investigation, but couldn't the script have made Eposito's character more interesting and less dull looking? Eposito herself pretty much sleepwalks through the role, not giving any sense of believability or sympathy to her un-developed character. I would've rather seen less of her or none at all.However, I did enjoy the rest of the cast. Michael Douglas knows this is easy work for him but he still gives it his all in the leading role. Famke Janssen has some very suspenseful scenes and she gives an excellent and enjoyable performance. The actress who really stands out here is Brittany Murphy. Murphy proves she is over the Clueless days and is now ready to give herself in to more challenging roles. Murphy's character is unstable and troubled, and the actress brings her to life vividly, sympathetically and with fantastic emotion. Murphy's character is one of the most developed in the movie and it is a joy to watch her.The movie's style and suspense also keep the story on its feet. I loved Murphy's characters flashbacks. They were shot excellently, the camera-work for the flashbacks provided a mysterious and moody atmosphere that I immensely enjoy in movies. The suspense scenes with Janssen are not as atmospheric, but remain extremely tense and incredibly well-acted.There are a couple of stand-out scenes too. I especially liked the scene where Douglas is taking Murphy out of the psychiatric hospital. This is one of the most intriguing sequences in the film, with great music to suit the action and some good facials on Douglas. The stand-down sequence of the film was the finale (isn't this getting common in movies these days?). You'll see for yourself what I mean, it's just plain dumb.Overall, this is a nicely acted thriller with some cool scenes, heaps of style and neat twists and turns. It's just unfortunate it suffers from a stupid ending, huge plot holes, some very boring and pretentious dialogue and an over-long running time. There'll be a bunch of better movies to see, but I can still recommend Don't Say a Word as an average and mostly enjoyable thriller.MY GRADE: C+",3,Too many plot holes and annoyances to reach its potential,1018310400,"04 9, 2002",2002,3404,"['Do', ""n't"", 'Say', 'Word', '2001', 'had', 'high', 'expectations', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Say', 'Word', 'Not', 'wanted', 'prove', 'critics', 'who', 'slammed', 'wrong', 'cast', 'looked', 'good', 'generally', 'good', 'suspense', 'movie', 'did', 'go', 'movie', 'expecting', 'like', 'came', 'out', 'generally', 'disappointed', 'felt', 'movie', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'highly', 'improved.I', 'good', 'far-fetched', 'fantasy', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'believable', 'thriller', 'thought', 'went', 'bit', 'far', 'were', 'countless', 'times', 'when', 'police', 'could', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'villains', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'kidnappers', 'had', 'planted', 'cameras', 'listening', 'devices', 'see', 'single', 'inch', 'characters', 'move', 'listen', 'everything', 'scene', 'when', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'talking', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'second', 'third', 'time', 'villains', 'are', 'listening', 'Just', 'how', 'could', 'plant', 'hearing', 'device', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'cell', 'Many', 'scenes', 'are', 'one', 'problem', 'sophisticated', 'thriller', 'be', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Say', 'Word', ""n't"", 'even', 'remotely', 'believable', 'sequences.I', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'story', 'cop', 'played', 'Jennifer', 'Eposito', 'scenes', 'took', 'up', 'lot', 'time', 'were', 'most', 'boring', 'parts', 'movie', 'Yes', 'know', 'needed', 'know', 'cop', 'investigation', 'could', ""n't"", 'script', 'have', 'made', 'Eposito', 'character', 'more', 'interesting', 'less', 'dull', 'looking', 'Eposito', 'pretty', 'much', 'sleepwalks', 'role', 'not', 'giving', 'sense', 'believability', 'sympathy', 'un-developed', 'character', 'would', ""'ve"", 'rather', 'seen', 'less', 'none', 'all.However', 'did', 'enjoy', 'rest', 'cast', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'easy', 'work', 'still', 'leading', 'role', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'very', 'suspenseful', 'scenes', 'excellent', 'enjoyable', 'performance', 'actress', 'who', 'really', 'out', 'here', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'Murphy', 'Clueless', 'days', 'now', 'ready', 'give', 'more', 'challenging', 'roles', 'Murphy', 'character', 'unstable', 'troubled', 'actress', 'life', 'vividly', 'sympathetically', 'fantastic', 'emotion', 'Murphy', 'character', 'one', 'most', 'developed', 'movie', 'joy', 'watch', 'her.The', 'movie', 'style', 'suspense', 'also', 'keep', 'story', 'feet', 'loved', 'Murphy', 'characters', 'flashbacks', 'were', 'shot', 'excellently', 'camera-work', 'flashbacks', 'provided', 'mysterious', 'moody', 'atmosphere', 'immensely', 'enjoy', 'movies', 'suspense', 'scenes', 'Janssen', 'are', 'not', 'atmospheric', 'remain', 'extremely', 'tense', 'incredibly', 'are', 'couple', 'stand-out', 'scenes', 'too', 'especially', 'liked', 'scene', 'where', 'Douglas', 'taking', 'Murphy', 'psychiatric', 'hospital', 'one', 'most', 'intriguing', 'sequences', 'film', 'great', 'music', 'suit', 'action', 'good', 'facials', 'Douglas', 'stand-down', 'sequence', 'film', 'was', 'finale', ""n't"", 'getting', 'common', 'movies', 'days', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'just', 'plain', 'dumb.Overall', 'nicely', 'acted', 'thriller', 'cool', 'scenes', 'heaps', 'style', 'neat', 'twists', 'turns', 'just', 'unfortunate', 'stupid', 'ending', 'huge', 'plot', 'holes', 'very', 'boring', 'pretentious', 'dialogue', 'over-long', 'running', 'time', ""'ll"", 'be', 'bunch', 'better', 'movies', 'see', 'can', 'still', 'recommend', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Say', 'Word', 'average', 'mostly', 'enjoyable', 'thriller.MY', 'GRADE', 'C+']",N/A

586846,APN6DO7VHDLTN,B00005JKIV,Missing Person,"[1, 2]","Michael Douglas often seems to unfairly get a bad rap; he's actually a marvelous actor--consider his superb performances in movies such as ""The China Syndrome"", ""Fatal Attraction"", ""Falling Down"", and ""The Game"", among many others, to be reminded. Douglas gives it his best shot in ""Don't Say A Word"" as well, playing a psychiatrist named Nathan Conrad.  Conrad's daughter Jessie (Sky McCole Bartusiak) is taken by a group of kidnappers lead by Patrick Koster (Sean Bean).  To meet Koster's request, Conrad must somehow pry a 6 digit number out of a mental patient named Elisabeth (Brittany Murphy).The key to a great thriller is its ability to really pull the viewer into its world and keep them captivated; ""Don't Say A Word"" comes up way short in this regard.  The movie takes itself super-seriously, and yet, there are lots of little details/ plot twists that are so far-fetched, they're eyeroll inducing.  In other words, you'll be saying to yourself ""give me a break"" time and time again over the course of this movie.  For one thing, the Brittany Murphy character is portrayed early on as an impenetrable, deeply disturbed patient who will ""never tell"" the Douglas character what he needs to know, but as the movie goes along, she alters her moods as a way of moving the story along--convenient, isn't it?--and for someone who's undoubtedly on some serious medication, this is hard to buy into.""Don't Say A Word"", as the saying goes, does have its moments, and it will keep you entertained throughout, largely thanks to a typically excellent and intense performance from Douglas.  Sean Bean's performance as the villian is actually pretty toothless, but Murphy does a convincing job of portraying a paranoid, frightened, and deeply disturbed mental patient, and Sky McCole Bartusiak is also commendable as the 8-year-old Jessie.""Don't Say A Word"" isn't a movie to go far out of your way for, but if you see the DVD real cheap in a clearance bin, it's worth picking up if you're a Douglas fan.

586848,A1YHKSTVSYEYTU,B00005JKIV,Mr. N. Carnegie,"[16, 22]","I was recently `lucky' enough to see Don't Say A Word at a preview screening at my local movie theatre (in the UK). It's always exciting to be able to see a movie weeks ahead of the general public, plus it has a promising cast. In particular, Michael Douglas is a very fine actor that seldom makes poor movies and I've been very impressed (so far) with Famke Janssen's transition from model to actress but unfortunately that was about all there was to get excited about.The opening bank robbery double cross scene of the movie is promising enough but unfortunately it's all downhill from there really. To say that the basic premise of the movie is pretty ridiculous and implausible is to understate. Dr Nathan Conrad an eminent psychiatrist is called in to help a clearly psychotic and uncommunicative patient, Elisabeth Burrows (Brittany Murphy), only to wake the next day to find that his daughter has been kidnapped by, the recently released from a ten year stretch in pokey, Patrick Koster (Sean Bean) and his bad boys. Apparently locked inside Burrows clearly loony head is a six digit code that will reveal the location of a $10 million diamond and in order to get his daughter back Dr Conrad has until 5 pm to retrieve the code.  Yeah, like in reality that would be possible!Don't Say A Word is by no means the worst film you will see this year but unfortunately when push comes to shove it's a thriller that quite frankly fails to thrill. There are so many plot holes so big you could drive a truck through them and all of the characters are so totally underdeveloped that you neither get a feel for them nor do you particularly care about them. Director Gary Fleder seems to be aiming at a David Fincher (Seven, The Game) type dark menace feel for the movie but instead you are just left feeling that you have seen this all somewhere before and done better (i.e., Ransom, Seven etc.). Michael Douglas is an Oscar winning actor, who has given us many excellent performances over the years (in movies such as Traffic, The Game, The Wonder Boys etc.) but even he can't cope with a lousy script. Famke Janssen meanwhile is left with even less to play with in her role as a bedridden housewife with a broken leg, who is still somehow able to deliver a sound beating to a hardened criminal, whilst Sean Bean is suitably menacing and makes a good fist of his bad guy role for most of the movie but inevitably in the end, even he is let down by some awful lines and an implausible plot.

586857,A1B3NP9BYLXX36,B00005JKIV,Ronald Bruce Meyer,"[0, 0]","Here's a new one: psychiatrist as action hero. First you hire Michael Douglas and then... you get the idea. When psychiatrist Nathan Conrad (Douglas) discovers his daughter has been kidnapped, and the key to retrieving her is a six-digit number buried in the jumbled mind of psych patient Elisabeth Burrows (Brittany Murphy), the jutting jaw goes into action to save his family from the bad guys, particularly Patrick Koster (Sean Bean), who want to retrieve a stolen gem hidden away for ten years while they were in prison.I have to admit that everyone in this film performed up to expectations. Sean Bean makes a cold, calculating, obsessed villain, as he has done before in GoldenEye (1995) and Patriot Games (1992). Twenty-five-year-old Brittany Murphy seems to specialize in playing troubled teens - she was pudgy and perfect in Clueless (1995) and perfectly crazy in Girl, Interrupted (1999) - so she doesn't disappoint here. Famke Janssen, a former Bond Girl and a good actress in spite of that pedigree, plays the laid-up wife, Aggie Conrad, with grit and determination to overcome a script with no surprises and no cleverness to call its own. And that's where Michael Douglas comes in.Douglas seems to specialize in macho, defender-of-family types, whether he brought the trouble into his own home, as in Fatal Attraction (1987), or when trouble is thrust upon him, as in Disclosure (1992) and Traffic (2000). But always Douglas is the steely nerved action hero when push comes to shove, even if his job description is a little wide of the mark. Indeed, toward the end of the movie, when time is short and his situation is grim, his aggressive approach is invaluable in wresting what he needs from his troubled patient, kind of like sixty-second psychotherapy.No matter. There were exciting moments that make Don't Say a Word diverting if not elevating. Oliver Platt as Conrad's colleague, Louis Sachs - similarly threatened by the bad guys who seem exceptionally well funded for recent convicts in need of a $10 million gem - did well with a minor role. My only complaint, aside from the script (Anthony Peckham, based on Andrew Klavan's novel) and the journeyman directing (Gary ""Kiss the Girls"" Fleder), is the wasted talent of Jennifer Esposito in the nearly disposable role of Detective Sandra Cassidy. She does the best she can - at least she gets a cellphone like everyone else. Indeed, in spite of this being what one might call a ""Michael Douglas film,"" the female players (Janssen, Esposito, and especially Murphy) were the real stand-outs.

His patients usually consist of those wealthy enough to afford his fees, but he cannot turn down his friend's request for help.  Dr. Louis Sachs (Oliver Platt) is desperate for someone to break through with a female patient who recently killed someone and could end up jailed in a mental institution for the rest of her life.  What Nathan doesn't know when he agrees to help is that locked inside Elisabeth's mind is a series of numbers that Patrick Koster (Sean Bean) is more than willing to kill for...Don't Say a Word wasn't particularly original, but I thought that all of the actors in the film did a superb job, which pushed the movie up from a three star rating.  Michael Douglas has long since perfected the role of innocent bystander who is sucked into a nefarious plot and manages to turn it all around, but I also truly believed that he created a bond with his patient and, while he cared for her, he cared for his daughter a great deal more.  Brittany Murphy was riveting as the disturbed Elisabeth and I love her vocal inflection when she says &quot;I'll never tell.&quot;  Sean Bean was also wonderful in his role as the kidnapper/killer/thief and is constantly underrated, if I do say so myself.  The weakness in this movie is the plot seems pretty contrived and easy to figure out.  You know exactly how the movie will end before you even start watching it, but you want to see how they manage to get there.  There were also some jarring inconsistencies that bothered me while I was watching the movie such as why Patrick killed Elisabeth's father before he told him where the diamond was (and in front of so many witnesses, too!) and why Detective Sandra Cassidy (Jennifer Esposito) was always at the right place, at the right time - every time the movie cut to her and her role it was jarringly out of place and felt like it wasn't a part of the story.

586862,AL277B4AQCWBG,B00005JKIV,Steven Reynolds,"[4, 7]","An elaborate blackmail plot involving the usual band of hoods conveniently fitted out with around three million bucks worth of hi-tech surveillance gear.  This time, they're in pursuit of a six-digit number locked inside the mind of a seemingly deranged girl.  Michael Douglas and Sean Bean are both convincing as anguished father and ruthless thug respectively, and Famke Janssen does wonders with a small role.  It's well directed by Gary Felder, and nicely shot, too.  All of which had me wondering what such obviously talented people were doing making such a banal, by-the-numbers film.  The problem here is a very slight screenplay which soon kills the tension by splitting the story into too many strands - one involving a female detective who only seems to have been included so she can come to the rescue further down the line.  In any case, a story which hinges on the repressed memories of a girl who won't talk, and a trauma which happened ten years ago, is much better material for a book than a film - and I'm sure Andrew Klavan's novel handled it more deftly.  Scribe, Andrew Peckham, tries to make the most of this quandary with flashbacks, but in the end it doesn't play: what happened in the past is far more dramatic than what's happening in the present - and that doesn't really make for an entertaining film.",2,A strange little film,1024704000,"06 22, 2002",2002,1328,"['elaborate', 'blackmail', 'plot', 'involving', 'usual', 'band', 'hoods', 'conveniently', 'fitted', 'out', 'three', 'million', 'bucks', 'worth', 'hi-tech', 'surveillance', 'gear', 'time', ""'re"", 'pursuit', 'six-digit', 'number', 'locked', 'mind', 'seemingly', 'deranged', 'girl', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'are', 'convincing', 'anguished', 'father', 'ruthless', 'thug', 'respectively', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'wonders', 'small', 'role', 'well', 'directed', 'Gary', 'Felder', 'nicely', 'shot', 'too', 'had', 'wondering', 'what', 'such', 'obviously', 'talented', 'people', 'were', 'doing', 'making', 'such', 'banal', 'by-the-numbers', 'film', 'problem', 'here', 'very', 'slight', 'screenplay', 'soon', 'tension', 'splitting', 'story', 'too', 'many', 'strands', 'one', 'involving', 'female', 'detective', 'who', 'only', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'can', 'come', 'rescue', 'further', 'line', 'case', 'story', 'repressed', 'memories', 'girl', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'talk', 'trauma', 'happened', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'much', 'better', 'material', 'book', 'film', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Andrew', 'Klavan', 'novel', 'handled', 'more', 'deftly', 'Scribe', 'Andrew', 'Peckham', 'make', 'most', 'quandary', 'flashbacks', 'end', ""n't"", 'play', 'what', 'happened', 'past', 'far', 'more', 'dramatic', 'what', 'happening', 'present', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'entertaining', 'film']",N/A

In this case it's the the first scenario.The film consumes about half an hour at the start drlling your brain  with how surrealy perfect Mike's family is. The wife is beautiful and has a broken leg which is why she stays in bed through out the film saying stuff that doesn't make her Confucius's daughter. Then Mike's also got a kid who is sweet as a bag of sugar and has the annoying habit of hiding everywhere in the house so that the perfect father of the century (that's Douglas again) can go find her and we can all hug as we are overtaken by the sweetness. Then we are shown Michael's great house, his cool furniture, his nice car, his witty colleagues, his great-going job and his nice hair along with other nice stuff too.By the way, the film is filmed on this planet (i think....).Right. After we are done with that the daughter gets kidnapped by mean people who want something that Michael doesnt fully understand but he's willing to go get it anyway (fetch, fetch).And then, Michael goes and gets all the bad guys so he can restore perfectness and put new life in the dream of the perfect american family that exists only in stunnigly poor films like this.There's not much more i can say, everything about this thing here is aweful, the script, the acting, the plot, the filming, the director, i couldnt find one thing that seemed to work.And i happen to be a big Douglas fan too.

Nothing sums up the quintessential fall thriller quite like ""Don't Say A Word"", a suspense romp as routine as they come.  Diverting enough to fool you into a good time, ""Don't Say A Word"" makes one wish for a leap in time to the holiday Oscar contenders already.  Dr. Nathan Conrad (Michael Douglas) is a successful psychiatrist with a beautiful wife (Famke Janssen) and a cherubic daughter. On Thanksgiving morning, a group of bad guys, lead by Patrick Koster (Sean Bean), break into Nathan's apartment and kidnap his daughter. What the men want is a jewel they lost 10 years earlier in a botched robbery that is being held in a secret place by Elisabeth Burrows (Brittany Murphy), a mentally unstable young girl rotting away in a hospital. Since Nathan seems to be the only medical professional she trusts, Patrick uses him as a pawn to recover the jewel. Nathan is soon at the mercy of the kidnappers, but as he gets deeper into Elisabeth's mind, he realizes the young girl could be helped after all.It's perfect casting to place Michael Douglas in the lead role, as no one could play yuppie paranoia quite like he can. Douglas has perfected this type of performance into an art form with his work in ""Fatal Attraction"" and ""A Perfect Murder; Douglas is a little more subdued than normal in this film, as his aging seems to be wearing away his ability to play the hot, rich stud who gets in over his head. The film does contain many moments of pure distressed Douglas (his forte), with his hair glistening, teeth clenched and his eyes scanning the room, etc. Douglas, at least in the first act of the film, makes an attempt to carry the picture with his expected bag of tricks. Soon enough, director Gary Fleder places too much narrative nonsense on Douglas's shoulders, and the actor eventually just gives up and lets the genre's conventions take him to the safety of the end credits.  Director Gary Fleder is no stranger to the fall thriller game, having directed both ""Kiss The Girls"" and the rollicking ""Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead."" Not really an imaginative director, Fleder nevertheless can be counted on to get the job done. With ""Don't Say A Word,"" Fleder isn't working with a particularly good script, so he falls back on what has worked for him before. This plan of attack from Fleder leaves the picture stale and overtly familiar. The film is not interested in adding new elements to the plot to keep things at least appearing fresh. The end result making ""Don't Say A Word"" more boring than exciting.The thriller, which is set in New York City, uses the city and apartment locations well, creating a nice sense of claustrophobia. It is when the action suddenly leaves the confines of the city and moves to a cemetery in a nearby island that the picture loses quite a bit of tension and interest. Moving to an obviously-a-soundstage cemetery ruins the fun of seeing the character freak out in their narrow apartments and office spaces. The film must end with a clich&eacute;d showdown, which is the reason for the move to a different location, but Fleder makes a big mistake taking the story away from the grip of the big bad city.  The one element that Fleder does get right is the casting of actress Brittany Murphy. A powderkeg of emotions, Murphy is the perfect choice to play the deranged Elisabeth. Murphy is a grand talent (where is her Emmy for her voice work as Luanne Platter on ""King Of The Hill""?), and the only actress in Hollywood that truly achieves success as both a tormented patient and a cute, little princess (""Just Married"", ""Uptown Girls""). Unpredictable and bristling with untapped passions, Murphy makes a vivid impression in ""Don't Say A Word.""  You've seen this type of film before, and just because it's the time of year when apples taste the best doesn't make this barely alive thriller any more enjoyable. For fans of the genre, ""Don't Say A Word"" is another solid installment in the Michael Douglas versus New York crime saga.

It combines all that can be expected from the best action thrillers, with a lot of interesting, mostly positive, psychology. It does radiate good vibrations most of the time. However, this is also a complex movie, with a sort of progression inside; it also left me a sad, uneasy feeling: as the story progresses and we get closer to the final happy conclusion for Jessie, the movie also somehow seem to fall into a sadder and sadder atmosphere. The end episode at Hart Island and the liberation of Jessie happen in a dark, rather frightening atmosphere and surroundings. The epitome of that downwrad progression is the very final shot with a lot of internal tension between the characters, an impression nearly more of sadness than joy (although Jessie has just been freed), rather sad dark-blue colors, and lights blinking everywhere (which is a rather threatening ambience, if you consider it from a distance). So much for the hints of a sad progression.The better sides now: the story itself is extremely interesting and very original; the characters are great, especially Conrad of course, who manages to focus so much energy and determination in a short timeframe to solve all the problems. Absolutely each and every scene is great, in one way or another; the robbery, Dr Conrad, the Conrad breakfast, the shock of Jessie's disparition, the lift, the morgue, the drive, Nathan's wife, the office, Elizabeth, Jessy and the kidnappers, Aggie's Battle, thesubway, etc.The best scene, by far, is Hart Island: Elizabeth memories, then al the rest: the first necounter with the kidnappers, the epic quest for the number, with all the good details ; the determination of Nathan Conrad; the sad but accurate memories of Elizabeteh father's death and burial; the number; the discovery; the battle; the conslusion...My mind just sort of gulped every moment of the Hart Island episode (that is mostly true of the whole movie anyway).I've seen plenty of good movies, but this one is probably one of the best, in its own gloomy particular way; it has a wonderful, special, sort of appeal.The atmosphere is very original and interesting, the shots, the background colors too.This is also a very demanding movie, in that it requires close attention from the spectator; however it is also well conducted in that the attention needed is never too much, and it is always pleasant anyway.In all the movie, most characters have a beautiful sort of aura, especially Nathan Conrad of course, but also Elizabeth, his wife, and his daughter.I really had a great, wonderful time watching this movie, and I am sure I will watch it again several times, and always enjoy it all the same.",5,"An exceptional movie, good stuff but with sad undertones",1043539200,"01 26, 2003",2003,2723,"['movie', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'more', 'one', 'respect', 'can', 'be', 'expected', 'best', 'action', 'thrillers', 'lot', 'interesting', 'mostly', 'positive', 'psychology', 'radiate', 'good', 'vibrations', 'most', 'time', 'However', 'also', 'complex', 'movie', 'sort', 'progression', 'also', 'left', 'sad', 'uneasy', 'feeling', 'story', 'progresses', 'get', 'closer', 'final', 'happy', 'conclusion', 'Jessie', 'movie', 'also', 'somehow', 'seem', 'fall', 'sadder', 'sadder', 'atmosphere', 'end', 'episode', 'Hart', 'Island', 'liberation', 'Jessie', 'happen', 'dark', 'rather', 'frightening', 'atmosphere', 'surroundings', 'epitome', 'downwrad', 'progression', 'very', 'final', 'shot', 'lot', 'internal', 'tension', 'characters', 'impression', 'nearly', 'more', 'sadness', 'joy', 'Jessie', 'just', 'been', 'freed', 'rather', 'sad', 'dark-blue', 'colors', 'lights', 'blinking', 'everywhere', 'rather', 'threatening', 'ambience', 'consider', 'distance', 'So', 'much', 'hints', 'sad', 'progression.The', 'better', 'sides', 'now', 'story', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'very', 'original', 'characters', 'are', 'great', 'especially', 'Conrad', 'course', 'who', 'focus', 'so', 'much', 'energy', 'determination', 'short', 'timeframe', 'solve', 'problems', 'Absolutely', 'scene', 'great', 'one', 'way', 'robbery', 'Dr', 'Conrad', 'Conrad', 'breakfast', 'shock', 'Jessie', 'disparition', 'lift', 'morgue', 'drive', 'Nathan', 'wife', 'office', 'Elizabeth', 'Jessy', 'kidnappers', 'Aggie', 'Battle', 'thesubway', 'etc.The', 'best', 'scene', 'far', 'Hart', 'Island', 'Elizabeth', 'memories', 'then', 'rest', 'first', 'necounter', 'kidnappers', 'epic', 'quest', 'number', 'good', 'details', 'determination', 'Nathan', 'Conrad', 'sad', 'accurate', 'memories', 'Elizabeteh', 'father', 'death', 'burial', 'number', 'discovery', 'battle', 'conslusion', 'My', 'mind', 'just', 'sort', 'gulped', 'moment', 'Hart', 'Island', 'episode', 'mostly', 'true', 'whole', 'movie', 'anyway', '.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'plenty', 'good', 'movies', 'one', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'own', 'gloomy', 'particular', 'way', 'wonderful', 'special', 'sort', 'appeal.The', 'atmosphere', 'very', 'original', 'interesting', 'shots', 'background', 'colors', 'too.This', 'also', 'very', 'demanding', 'movie', 'close', 'attention', 'spectator', 'however', 'also', 'well', 'conducted', 'attention', 'needed', 'never', 'too', 'much', 'always', 'pleasant', 'movie', 'most', 'characters', 'have', 'beautiful', 'sort', 'aura', 'especially', 'Nathan', 'Conrad', 'course', 'also', 'Elizabeth', 'wife', 'daughter.I', 'really', 'had', 'great', 'wonderful', 'time', 'watching', 'movie', 'am', 'sure', 'will', 'watch', 'again', 'several', 'times', 'always', 'enjoy', 'same']",N/A
586868,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00005JKIV,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[3, 3]","""Don't Say A Word"" strikes me as the film equivalent of a novel by an author who `writes' a book every six months or a year. The books are usually similar and the characters have been changed slightly. They go through the same motions to get to the same conclusion. ""Don't Say A Word"" is like many thrillers churned out by the studios over the years. A normal, successful father/husband has to summon all of his will and strength to battle the bad guys for his wife/ daughter/ son. Astonishingly, you can predict every single `surprise' in ""Word"".Dr. Nathan Conrad (Michael Douglas) is a successful psychiatrist racing home on Thanksgiving Eve. His wife (Famke Janssen) is laid up in bed with a broken leg thanks to her most recent skiing accident. Their daughter, Jessie (Skye McCole Bartusiak), likes to play hide and seek in the many closets in the Conrad's fabulous Manhattan loft. During the ride home, an old colleague, Dr. Jerald Sachs (Oliver Platt, phoning it in in a performance he has played at least five times already), summons him to the mental hospital to meet with a strange case. The strange case is Elisabeth Burrows (Brittany Murphy), an 18 year old girl who has received 20 different diagnoses over the last ten years. Conrad quickly determines that Elisabeth is faking her comatose state when she mutters ""I'll Never Tell"". Conrad speeds home to be with his wife and precocious daughter. She demands two kisses for his tardiness. The next morning, Conrad makes breakfast for his wife and starts looking for Jessie. After searching the entire apartment, he realizes that the chain on the front door was broken. At that moment, Patrick Koster (Sean Bean) calls and tells them that he has Jessie and will hold her until Conrad can get a 6 digit number out of Elisabeth's head. He has until 5:00.Michael Douglas has played this type of role before. In films like ""A Perfect Murder"" and ""Disclosure"", he seems to be perfecting the role of father who becomes vigilante. I find that it stretches the credibility a bit to have these company executives/ psychiatrists/ successful suits suddenly shooting guns, driving recklessly, etc., as though they have been trained in guerilla warfare. To Douglas' credit, he makes the transition seem somewhat smooth. Some of the battles are fought with wits and this seems natural for his character.Brittany Murphy is very good as Elisabeth. She manages to convey the clouded perception and creepiness the character has lived through for many years. About halfway through the film, she suddenly becomes an ally to Conrad, a shift that is painted in broad strokes straining credibility to the breaking point. Yes, I get that she feels that Conrad could become the father figure she craves, but this type of shift needs to be much more subtle.Patrick Koster is a jewelery robber and that is about it. The villain, usually the most interesting character in a film like this, is simply a very determined robber. He doesn't even appear that psychotic. Bean, a very interesting British actor (you probably remember him best from ""GoldenEye""), is given nothing to do. He merely grimaces throughout most of the picture as he hunts down the elusive prize he has sought for ten years. I would think that after ten years of obsessing over this, he would be a little off-kilter, a little unhinged, but this is not explored much to the detriment of the film and our experience watching it.The one thing ""Don't Say A Word"" has going for it is a very defined visual style. All of the scenes of Douglas' character at home are rosy and warm. All of the scenes outside, on the mean streets of New York, are icy and blue. This shift also reflects Conrad's state as he leaves the comforts of home and ventures out into the city.Gary Fleder, the director of ""Word"", also directed ""Kiss The Girls"", both based on the same type of literary pablum.

586870,A9U5CELFTZ4U8,B00005JKIV,"T. J. Bacon ""TJB""","[0, 2]","In BriefEminent Psychiatrist Nathan Conrad is swept up into a race against time to extract a six-digit number from a faux-catatonic teenager or else his kidnapped daughter will be killed.  With his family under surveillance he is forced to comply, while unknown to him a persistent detective is also on the trail following the dead bodies and clues to a final showdown.ReviewDirector Gary Fleder broke onto the scene back in 1995 with a stylish debut in the noir `Things to do in Denver when you're dead.'  Since then with his follow up `Kiss the girls' and now this month's `Don't say a word,' it appears he will never truly regain the magic present in the first film.  A casual observer of his three works to date might be correct in saying that it's the work of a man trying to recapture or duplicate something, rather then push themselves in a new direction.Don't say a word, is what has become typical Fleder: A great TV movie with a bigger budget, a star name in the leading role, and some flashy camera moves or choppy editing.  This is a by the book thriller, taking the Hitchcockian `fish-out-of-water' hero and letting him struggle against all odds just one more time!  Indeed, to watch the performance of Douglas, one is given the feeling that there is nothing to really stretch himself within the confines of the character, and this is rather more a paid job than a chance to perform!While `Kiss the girls' gave the viewer an interesting take on the issue of voyeurism, this film has nothing to challenge the audience.  However it must be said that the camera work is competently done and the production design by Nelson Coates is beautiful; each of the autumn leaves on the trees in the final scene are silk and were sown on by hand!What truly lets this film down is the third act and conclusion: Throughout the film Detective Sandra Cassidy (Jennifer Esposito) has been on the trail of the kidnappers.  This one-dimensional character never really seems to fit; superfluous, she flits in and out of the film managing to take away any tension surrounding Conrad's fight against all odds.  Never truly a consistent character, she completely disappears for the bulk of the third act only to reappear in a clich&eacute;d `nick-of-time' moment.  Unfortunately the director seems unaware of the candyfloss content of his film and the ending is drawn out as if the audience needs time to recover when in fact the typical selection of slow mo reunions make you want to run for the door, rather than savour the moment.The VerdictDon't say a word, is a typical Hollywood thriller, its only purpose is to give the studio a return.  Its not a classic and I only hope Fleder's next film with Gary Sinise is better as he finally breaks away from the sort of thing that I would quite happily sit and watch for free on TV but would definitely not pay to go to.",2,PREDICTABLE,1073433600,"01 7, 2004",2004,2857,"['BriefEminent', 'Psychiatrist', 'Nathan', 'Conrad', 'swept', 'up', 'race', 'time', 'extract', 'six-digit', 'number', 'faux-catatonic', 'teenager', 'else', 'kidnapped', 'daughter', 'will', 'be', 'killed', 'family', 'surveillance', 'forced', 'comply', 'unknown', 'persistent', 'detective', 'also', 'trail', 'following', 'dead', 'bodies', 'clues', 'final', 'showdown.ReviewDirector', 'Gary', 'Fleder', 'broke', 'scene', 'back', '1995', 'stylish', 'debut', 'noir', 'Things', 'do', 'Denver', 'when', ""'re"", 'dead', 'then', 'follow', 'up', 'Kiss', 'girls', 'now', 'month', 'Do', ""n't"", 'say', 'word', 'will', 'never', 'truly', 'regain', 'magic', 'present', 'first', 'film', 'casual', 'observer', 'three', 'works', 'date', 'might', 'be', 'correct', 'saying', 'work', 'man', 'trying', 'recapture', 'duplicate', 'something', 'rather', 'then', 'push', 'new', 'direction.Do', ""n't"", 'say', 'word', 'what', 'become', 'typical', 'Fleder', 'great', 'TV', 'movie', 'bigger', 'budget', 'star', 'name', 'leading', 'role', 'flashy', 'camera', 'moves', 'choppy', 'editing', 'book', 'thriller', 'taking', 'Hitchcockian', 'fish-out-of-water', 'hero', 'letting', 'struggle', 'odds', 'just', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'Indeed', 'watch', 'performance', 'Douglas', 'one', 'given', 'feeling', 'nothing', 'really', 'stretch', 'confines', 'character', 'rather', 'more', 'paid', 'job', 'chance', 'perform', 'Kiss', 'girls', 'gave', 'viewer', 'interesting', 'take', 'issue', 'voyeurism', 'film', 'nothing', 'challenge', 'audience', 'However', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'camera', 'work', 'competently', 'done', 'production', 'design', 'Nelson', 'Coates', 'beautiful', 'autumn', 'trees', 'final', 'scene', 'are', 'silk', 'were', 'sown', 'hand', 'What', 'truly', 'film', 'down', 'third', 'act', 'conclusion', 'film', 'Detective', 'Sandra', 'Cassidy', 'Jennifer', 'Esposito', 'been', 'trail', 'kidnappers', 'one-dimensional', 'character', 'never', 'really', 'fit', 'superfluous', 'film', 'managing', 'take', 'away', 'tension', 'surrounding', 'Conrad', 'fight', 'odds', 'Never', 'truly', 'consistent', 'character', 'completely', 'bulk', 'third', 'act', 'only', 'reappear', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'nick-of-time', 'moment', 'Unfortunately', 'director', 'unaware', 'candyfloss', 'content', 'film', 'ending', 'drawn', 'out', 'audience', 'time', 'recover', 'when', 'fact', 'typical', 'selection', 'slow', 'mo', 'reunions', 'make', 'want', 'run', 'door', 'rather', 'savour', 'moment.The', 'VerdictDo', ""n't"", 'say', 'word', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'thriller', 'only', 'purpose', 'give', 'studio', 'return', 'not', 'classic', 'only', 'hope', 'Fleder', 'next', 'film', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'better', 'finally', 'away', 'sort', 'thing', 'would', 'quite', 'happily', 'sit', 'watch', 'free', 'TV', 'would', 'definitely', 'not', 'pay', 'go']",N/A
586871,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JKIV,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 3]","You are a thriving psychiatrist living in NYC played by Michael Douglas (who can play this kind of role while deeply sleeping).  You got a gorgeous wife Famke Janssen, and a lovely daughter too.  And in our average Hollywood thriller world, you will soon realize that someone like bad guy Sean Bean is watching out the chance to use you and your ability, to make a so-so thriller like this based on Andrew Klavan's bestselling novel.Michale Douglas is renowned doctor Conrad, whose daughter is kidnapped by Sean Bean's character.  But in this case, what Conrad has to do is not to get ready the ransom, but induce one of his patients in the mental institution where he works, to tell certain 6 digits, within given time limit, without telling anything the police.  Otherwise, you are never to see your daughter, blah, blah.In the meanwhile, very convienient for the bad guys perhaps, Mrs. Conrad is in bed because of her broken leg, and she cannot help her husband.  Moreover, someone seems to have installed a device that reports every minute of her life, in order to stall any rash movement on the side of the Conrads.  Bad day, isn't it?As I have pointed out, the crucial thing is about the relations between the doctor and his patient with troubled mind.  Michael Douglas with his rather hammy (but in this case apt acting) is not bad at all, and Brittany Murphy plays the role of that patient with convincing (or, too convincing) acting.  However, we have seen them before in the familiar type of roles: Douglas in &quot;Basic Instinct and many others, and Murphy in &quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot; (remember roasted-chicken) and about Sean Bean, you got countless examples in which he played the same kind of villains, like one of the 007 series.  In short, they are typecast, probably with the exception of Jennifer Esposito (of &quot;Spin City&quot;) as tenacious Detective Cassidy.Those complaints aside, director Gary Fleder keeps the ball rolling, though not exactly better than in his previous thriller &quot;Kiss the Girls,&quot; but still he holds our attention somehow to the end.  And the photography of Amir Mokri with subdued lighting is another asset of the film.  In conclusion, this is nothing new, nothing inspiring, but still a satisfactry thiller.

At first glance, it seems like your typical plotless, characterless, crime-glorifying action film.  In fact, it was quite the opposite.Everyone who's seen the ad knows the plot: A deranged girl has ""a six digit number hidden away somewhere in her troubled mind,"" and in order to save his kidnapped daughter, a fancy psychiatrist has to get the girl to reveal that number.  I was pleasantly surprised when they finally discovered what sort of number it was, as it turned out to be much more interesting than just a bank code... But what struck me most were the characters.  Alright, they were a little stereotyped.  Still, though, they were very likable.  I found myself deeply concerned about what would happen to the little girl who was kidnapped and her parents.  Even the psychotic girl, Elisabeth Burrows, becomes a real person rather than just a tool to get the kidnapped daughter back.  And, even though I've seen many movies with ruthless criminals, the sheer cruelty of the one in this movie kept startling me.Perhaps, in retrospect, the plot was a little... dumb.  After all, they hardly go into important details such as how the criminals even know Elisabeth has a number, why she is faking illness, how sick she really is, how the heck the baddies got cameras everywhere, etc.  But while watching, all those things seem unimportant.
