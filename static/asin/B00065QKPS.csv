Olsen,"[3, 4]","The always perfect looking Connie Sellecca plays Carolyn Giblin, an L.A. therapist who divorces her cheating husband, takes her young teenage daughter, and moves back to her hometown of Mayville, to the old house she inherited from her Grandma. Randy Travis plays Clay Traynor, the long ago flame that she literally left standing at the alter (""lookin' like an idiot in a rented tuxedo"") when she skipped town many years ago. Rue McClanahan turns in her usual top-notch performance as Travis' aunt, Miz Leona, who usually speaks her mind.Carolyn wants to escape the rat race of the city and have a quiet, hometown Christmas. Her daughter, Jordy, is disgruntled over the move and the fact that Mayville doesn't even have a mall or cable (though she doesn't seem to spend much time missing her father). Things aren't quite as serene as Carolyn hoped. The house is a shambles, there is a runaway in the form of a young boy (William) hiding in the basement with his dog, and Clay Traynor is still in Mayville. He is constantly thrown in her path and is still annoyingly attractive to her. Through his interference the woman from social services, Eve, comes to get the boy to place him in foster care just before Christmas and it is at that point that Carolyn realizes there is something going on between Clay and Eve. Why should that bother her? She has already made it clear that she isn't interested in him  anymore.Jordy and the runaway spend a lot of time bickering, Carolyn is constantly spouting psychological theory, Clay keeps busy being the local police, mayor, handyman, and trying to evade Eve's less than subtle pursuit of him, and Miz Leona keeps making pies and dishing out opinions.By the time Carolyn finally faces the fact that she wants Clay back it is Christmas Day, and Clay drops by to let her know that he realizes he needs to move on and make a commitment to Eve.If you can get past some of the inconsistencies in this movie (snow on the yard in one scene, then on the same day minutes later the neighbor's yard has almost no snow; a dog that is supposed to be pregnant sure doesn't look it, and the hours-old puppy in the backpack is amazingly large with open eyes, etc.) and some of the things that date it (Sellecca's fashions, cassette tapes, corded phones), then the movie is a pleasant way to pass a holiday evening.

I agree with the other negative review that the female lead is way too harsh with the male lead considering she left him at the altar.  There's very little chemistry (what a shame!) between the lead characters, and it takes a little too long for them to explain why she left for the film to ""work"".
