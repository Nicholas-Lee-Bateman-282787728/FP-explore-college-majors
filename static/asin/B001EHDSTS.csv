It would not play on my Vista machine with either my LG DVD writer or my Sony Blu-Ray player, due to the hardware anti-copy provisions. It will play on my XP machine, but only in my older DVD player, not my LG DVD burner. The DVD player is old enough to not have those damned restrictions.NOTE: I finally switched my older machine to Ubuntu Linux, with the same results.The video quality is excellent, equal to commercial DVDs. The disk art and packaging are as good as commercial DVDs as well. And the show itself is great, very funny and good-natured.

1185840,A2T0DIXULILRQR,B001EHDSTS,Kris128183,"[7, 8]","This show was one of Nickelodeon's best. Very funny and unlike some NICK shows today it was completely age appropriate and had nothing that made parents cringe. Season 2 of Ned's Declassified aired from 2005-2006 and followed Ned and his friends through their 7th grade year in middle school. Just a fun show to watch; filled with wacky and wild antics and some pretty useful tips for kids in middle school as well. This is actually the complete 2nd season(not one of Amazon's ""best of"" DVDs) but it was released only in Canada(along with Seasons 2 and 3 of Zoey 101) but now a few copies are making their way into the United States. Disappointing that Nick cancelled this show after just 3 seasons but thanks to a DVD company in Canada the entire series is available on DVD.",5,Fantastic Show,1316131200,"09 16, 2011",2011,775,"['show', 'was', 'one', 'Nickelodeon', 'best', 'Very', 'funny', 'NICK', 'shows', 'today', 'was', 'completely', 'age', 'appropriate', 'had', 'nothing', 'made', 'parents', 'cringe', 'Season', '2', 'Ned', 'Declassified', 'aired', '2005-2006', 'followed', 'Ned', 'friends', '7th', 'grade', 'year', 'middle', 'school', 'Just', 'fun', 'show', 'watch', 'filled', 'wacky', 'wild', 'antics', 'pretty', 'useful', 'tips', 'kids', 'middle', 'school', 'as', 'well', 'actually', 'complete', '2nd', 'season', 'not', 'one', 'Amazon', 'best', 'DVDs', 'was', 'released', 'only', 'Canada', 'Seasons', '2', '3', 'Zoey', '101', 'now', 'few', 'copies', 'are', 'making', 'way', 'United', 'States', 'Disappointing', 'Nick', 'cancelled', 'show', 'just', '3', 'seasons', 'thanks', 'DVD', 'company', 'Canada', 'entire', 'series', 'available', 'DVD']",Ned’s Declassified School Survival Guide – The Best of Season 2
