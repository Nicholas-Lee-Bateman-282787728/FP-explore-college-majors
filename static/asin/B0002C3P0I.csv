It is not even good enough to be called ""so-bad-it's-good""; it's just plain bad. It is a shame because this is an awesome story, but the writer/director missed the boat on delivery. This film added to the decline of Mormon cinema. Of course shoddy acting, lack of continuity, odd scriptural interpretations and creative liberties did not help any.

Overall a good effort, and there is nothing that should really bother anyone that knows the story. What is sad are the attempts by non-members of the church to use this movie and this forum as a excuse to just attack. Worse are the comments by so called members to discourage anyone from watching this movie, and make up their own minds as to what is trying to be told. They just become a partner in the attacks. This movie trys to tell a story, and as mentioned made a better effort than many would have done with the same. At least they did it out of love.

My comments are based on the production values and acting int his movie, not on theology or historical accuracy. Watching this movie I felt as though I had stumbled upon a poor school production performed by the special needs students. The acting was not very good, line delivery seemed campy and read from que cards. The ""special effects"" were amaturish, especially when the Nephi and his family finally reach the promised land. The aging make-up was silly. The depiction of the Lamanites (or native southern and northern Americans) was unnecessary - they were depicted as cartoonish cannibals, jumping and dancing, screaming and shouting around a bon fire. The garish and silly make-up and costumes, as well the Lamanites ""crazy"" behavior was to emphasize that they were godless and lost their way by not heeding Nephi's counsel.

They stated that the movie was horrible, nowhere near as good as the book, and was a waste of time. Considering who wrote the book, there's no way the movie would be as good as the book. I got the movie as I am unfamiliar with the Book of Mormon in general as I joined the church late. I have started reading it numerous times, but because of work, have had to stop. When I get to start again, I freguently forget where I left off. I should use a bookmark, but don't. Anyways, I watched the movie, and found it to be quite close to the book. No, Charlten Heston doesn't star in it, you won't find any big names that you will recognize, but this isn't a hollywood movie filled with sex, drugs, and homicidal maniacs. It is a movie that is supposed to open up curiosity into the church, inform people of a little of the history in the BOM, and teach people who haven't read the book about it. I watched the movie with a group of friends, one of which went on a mission the week after, a branch president, and quite a few others. Some of the ones that were there were not members, but after watching the movie became interested and wanted to learn more. It was also entertaining as well. I would say the movie completed everything it was made to do. If your going to compare it to the Book of Mormon, your going to find fault in it.

829873,A2D9IEFJGB483Q,B0002C3P0I,Kendal B. Hunter,"[2, 4]","I think that any animosity to this project come from misunderstanding the nature of independent films.  By definition, independent films are not big-budget blockbusters.  Conceded that this film is not Lucas, Spielberg, or even as good as an LDS Church Seminary video. The trade-off, however, is good writing, a good spirit, and a sense of the filmmakers passion for the project.  As an independent film, this is at par in quality, direction, style of other independent films, so this issue is a non-issue.Secondly, the spunk and drive to make a mass-market movies release of the Book of Mormon deserves our praise.  The very effort itself betokens someone who is ""anxiously engaged"" and is not ""compelled in all things.""  They did not wait for a First Presidency Directive, but took it upon themselves to do this project.  As the author of ""Consider My Servant Job"" (ISBN: 1555177522), I appreciate self-motivation.  No one told me to write my book, and no one told them to make this film.  But that is how it should be.This film is true to the spirit and fact of the Book of Mormon.  I have read the book about sixty times, and there is no doctrinal problem in the film.  Some artistic license was taken, such as the names and number of Nephi's sisters, but that is no different than the fictitious character of Eliza Walker in ""Legacy"" or the fictitious report in ""Mountain of the House of the Lord.""  In fact, the license taken in the film is far  less intrusive than the fictitious Steed family in ""The Work and the Glory"" series.  I am a McBride, and Elder Lund did mess with my family line!I think we all understand this is one man's vision of the Book of Mormon, with heavy reliance upon Arnold Freeburg's images, and a mixture of the Disney's templette.

My purpose in watching it was to get a general outline--or at least a feel--for what the Book of Mormon contains. Additionally, in fairness, the movie should be compared with other movies produced by religious houses, such as Ten Clouds (Left Behind I, II, & III, etc.). In this light, the film fairs well. The acting is reasonably believable, though occasionally modern dialogue slips into this historic drama. The effects, while probably subpar by Hollywood standards, are high-medium for religious films. OK, the scene where Nehi ""shocks"" his brothers was pretty feeble!The plot is the key here. While the target audience would certainly be primarily Mormon, the LDS church surely hopes that some non-members will see the film and become curious. In that vein, the film does a decent job of presenting a story that very few actually know. In doing so, the story feels very much like one that might have been done about Joseph, or the 10 Commandments, etc. In fact, some of the parallels were clearly intentionally. This story is meant to feel like a biblical epic.I was surprised to learn that the movie came out in 2002. Nearly five years, and still no part II? Like Left Behind, future episodes are likely to be direct-to-dvd. The big let down for fans who like this series, is that there seems to be a distinct possiblitity it will not see its way to completion.Bottom-line: Three stars for a religious movie that compares favorably with others in the genre, and succeeds in creating the feel of a biblical epic.
