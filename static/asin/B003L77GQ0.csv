1352625,ANUJC77UL5SPP,B003L77GQ0,Francis,"[0, 0]","All the other reviews for this show pretty much cover the brilliant writing, direction and acting especially Elliott. Hers is such a challenging character to play convincingly but she brings so much subtle detail to every scene that you actually believe there really ARE two people in there.The main difference between this season and the first is the progression of Levering's character 'Kim'. There is a little less of the completely unlikeable antagonist in these episodes and more a case (get it?) of her rock-solid honesty shining through under any circumstances. Although she still has the emotional intelligence of a bar of soap, (she is the antagonist to Jane's protagonist remember), this second season puts her in a little more human light than the first.One strange thing about this comedy/drama in general though is that Cho, the only stand-up comic in the whole cast, has probably the least funniest character of them all. Without a doubt, Bowlby as Stacy is the show stealer for any scene she is in. The chemistry and comedic interplay between her and Elliott is undeniable and like one of those magic pairings that can make a break a series. In this case, they make it big time.5 stars!",5,Full of surprises yet again.,1352073600,"11 5, 2012",2012,1201,"['other', 'reviews', 'show', 'pretty', 'much', 'brilliant', 'writing', 'direction', 'acting', 'especially', 'Elliott', 'Hers', 'such', 'challenging', 'character', 'play', 'convincingly', 'so', 'much', 'subtle', 'detail', 'scene', 'actually', 'believe', 'really', 'ARE', 'two', 'people', 'there.The', 'main', 'difference', 'season', 'first', 'progression', 'Levering', 'character', ""'Kim"", 'little', 'less', 'completely', 'unlikeable', 'antagonist', 'episodes', 'more', 'case', 'get', 'rock-solid', 'honesty', 'shining', 'circumstances', 'still', 'emotional', 'intelligence', 'bar', 'soap', 'antagonist', 'Jane', 'protagonist', 'remember', 'second', 'season', 'little', 'more', 'human', 'light', 'first.One', 'strange', 'thing', 'comedy/drama', 'general', 'though', 'Cho', 'only', 'stand-up', 'comic', 'whole', 'cast', 'probably', 'least', 'funniest', 'character', 'doubt', 'Bowlby', 'Stacy', 'show', 'stealer', 'scene', 'chemistry', 'comedic', 'interplay', 'Elliott', 'undeniable', 'one', 'magic', 'pairings', 'can', 'make', 'break', 'series', 'case', 'make', 'big', 'time.5', 'stars']",N/A
