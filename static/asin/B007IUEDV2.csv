1531500,A1U6XPYATU9OPG,B007IUEDV2,G. Denick,"[0, 0]","It should be noted that I'm a bit biased, being a huge fan of David Cross ever since the days of ""Mr. Show"" (and of course, he gained the status of legend for his role of Tobias Fuhke on ""Arrested Development""). Anything this quirky guy says or does is very funny in my book, and ""Demoted"" is no exception. He plays the awkward, stumbling character that he has become known for in all his work, and the results are the same: it's just plain funny. Therefore, if you're a fan of David Cross, you will not be disappointed.The story revolves around three tire salesmen, one of which is named Ken ""Don't Call Me Kenny"" Castro, played by David Cross. Ken is perpetually teased and tormented by his co-workers, so it comes as a delightful surprise to him when he receives an unexpected promotion (due to an odd set of circumstances), that positions him as the new boss of all salesmen- including the ones who have made his life so miserable. Ken's first order of business is to give his tormentors a taste of their own medicine. He chooses to demote them... to male secretaries. Finding the employment market to be inhospitable, the demoted duo has no choice but to join the pool of secretaries, a group that is none too receptive, given their past exchanges.""Demoted"" is by no means a masterpiece, but it's a very good comedy that's well worth watching for people who like to laugh at the nuances and relationships of the workplace- oftentimes, as they say, there is a lot of truth in fiction. Things can be exaggerated a bit at times, but overall, this story remains fairly close to what ACTUALLY happens in setting of the American workplace. Although this is clearly a low brow movie, I was quite surprised to see how the writers subtly began transferring the viewers' sympathies from one character to another- it was unexpected and well executed. ""Office Space"" focuses on cubicle work, ""Extract"" focuses on blue collar factory labor, and ""Demoted"" is an interesting look at the world of salesmen and secretaries.",4,David Cross does it again!,1347667200,"09 15, 2012",2012,2011,"['should', 'be', 'noted', ""'m"", 'bit', 'biased', 'being', 'huge', 'fan', 'David', 'Cross', 'ever', 'days', 'Mr.', 'Show', 'course', 'gained', 'status', 'legend', 'role', 'Tobias', 'Fuhke', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'Anything', 'quirky', 'guy', 'very', 'funny', 'book', 'Demoted', 'exception', 'awkward', 'stumbling', 'character', 'become', 'known', 'work', 'results', 'are', 'same', 'just', 'plain', 'funny', 'Therefore', ""'re"", 'fan', 'David', 'Cross', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'three', 'tire', 'salesmen', 'one', 'named', 'Ken', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Call', 'Me', 'Kenny', 'Castro', 'played', 'David', 'Cross', 'Ken', 'perpetually', 'teased', 'tormented', 'co-workers', 'delightful', 'surprise', 'when', 'unexpected', 'promotion', 'due', 'odd', 'set', 'circumstances', 'positions', 'new', 'boss', 'salesmen-', 'including', 'ones', 'who', 'have', 'made', 'life', 'so', 'miserable', 'Ken', 'first', 'order', 'business', 'give', 'tormentors', 'taste', 'own', 'medicine', 'demote', 'male', 'secretaries', 'Finding', 'employment', 'market', 'be', 'inhospitable', 'demoted', 'duo', 'choice', 'join', 'pool', 'secretaries', 'group', 'none', 'too', 'receptive', 'given', 'past', 'exchanges', 'Demoted', 'masterpiece', 'very', 'good', 'comedy', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'people', 'who', 'like', 'laugh', 'nuances', 'relationships', 'workplace-', 'oftentimes', 'say', 'lot', 'truth', 'fiction', 'Things', 'can', 'be', 'exaggerated', 'bit', 'times', 'overall', 'story', 'fairly', 'close', 'what', 'ACTUALLY', 'setting', 'American', 'workplace', 'clearly', 'low', 'brow', 'movie', 'was', 'quite', 'surprised', 'see', 'how', 'writers', 'subtly', 'began', 'transferring', 'viewers', 'sympathies', 'one', 'character', 'another-', 'was', 'unexpected', 'well', 'executed', 'Office', 'Space', 'focuses', 'cubicle', 'work', 'Extract', 'focuses', 'blue', 'collar', 'factory', 'labor', 'Demoted', 'interesting', 'look', 'world', 'salesmen', 'secretaries']",N/A

Mike (Astin) and Rodney (Vartan) are the best salesmen and Treadstone tire, and they know it. Being rude to everyone has become standard fare until their boss dies. When Ken Castro (Cross), who has been the brunt of their jokes, takes over he immediately demotes them to secretaries. The two realize how they have been and begin to change their ways. I will start by saying that I liked this movie and laughed quite a bit but this is also nothing amazing at all. Very predictable and pretty much a no substance movie but it is worth watching and I liked it. Think ""Office Space"" but a step above on the absurd scale.
