The Goonies never played in the theaters in my country or aired on TV and I had not come across it on any TV channels in North America. I had heard many things about it.Overall, I think this is a fantastic item containing all three movies which are considered to be the essential 80s entertainment. The Goonies didn't have the same effect on me as it did on many fans. Seeing it as a grownup is not the same thing as seeing as a teenager; I am sure if I had seen it as a kid, it would have had a much more different impact on me. It would be like reminiscing the childhood memory. Unfortunately, I didn't get that feeling. To me, it was an OK movie. I was never a fan of the Chinese kid (who didn't do much for me in Indiana Jones 2nd movie) ; I also didn't like the cliche jokes about the fat kid (he is always stuffing food in the beginning of the movie), and I also didn't like the way they played the deformed character Sloth; I found that creepy and sad but not funny or amusing in any way. Other than that, there are some really funny lines, memorable scenes which make this movie fun to watch (it was also amusing to see Josh Brolin so young). Watching this with commentary from the director and cast (25th anniversary commentary) was actually more fun for me than watching the movie itself. There were a lot of nice jokes and funny commentaries regarding the making of the movie.Gremlins is as great as I remembered it, and maybe even better than I remembered it. It is very well-made, great special features, suspense and funny moments are nicely complementing each other and the original score is awesome. I can watch this again and again.Gremlins 2: Not as great as the Gremlins. This one is more cartoonish than the first movie. But it still has a very nice pace and some new additions to the concept (for instance, the genetic lab in the building allows some newly mutated Gremlins to be produced). I wasn't amused by the seductive female Gremlin creature or by the fact that some Gremlins monsters were talking as if they were human beings.All three movies come with feature commentaries and making-of featurettes which is a bonus.
