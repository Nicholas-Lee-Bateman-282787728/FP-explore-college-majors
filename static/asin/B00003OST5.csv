545845,A33L7G4E8CID3,B00003OST5,"Adam Dukovich ""colts_19""","[106, 111]","I am confused with many of the editorial reviews on the site. This incarnation of Othello is, in my mind, nearly perfect. Sure, it can't encapsulate everything Shakespeare intended, but it stays true to his themes of jealousy, obsession and power, and featured fantastic acting and production values.What can I say about Othello that hasn't already been said in dozens of dissertations already? As one of the ""big four"" (Hamlet, Macbeth, King Lear and Othello) it has remained a benchmark for tragedies for centuries. Some people might scoff at the film's intent to make Shakespeare accessible to the lay viewer, but it truly doesn't hurt the story or interfere with Shakespeare's always delightful prose. In short, the movie outperforms any preconceived notions one might have.The cast is wonderful. A pre-Matrix Lawrence Fishburne stars as the Moor, Irene Jakob as Desdemona, and the infallible Kenneth Branaugh as Iago, Shakespeare's most complex and calculating villain. Often in Shakespeare plays, the villain is more interesting than the hero, and that is certainly true here. Branaugh steals every scene he is in with his coldly malevolent performance, and his asides to the audience are drenched in dread and rage. One can nearly pity the man, he comes off as so tortured. It is perhaps the best performance I've ever seen out of an actor, period. Fishburne was pretty much a nobody when the film was made, but that doesn't stop him from holding his own with Brannaugh and churning out the iambic pentameter. He hits his marks very well and is very convincing when it comes to acting with passion. Irene Jakob is not necessarily the choice I would have made for Desdemona. I would have chosen someone with a more coquettish personality. However, the fact that her loyalty is beyond question actually enhances the story by showing how obviously and irrationally jealous Othello becomes.The production is first-rate. The sets, sounds, costumes, etc. are fantastic. One really gets a you-are-there feeling (as corny as that sounds) by watching the movie. After overstylized (and awful) postmodern Shakespeare interpretations, it is refreshing to see the world as Shakespeare himself envisioned it.Unfortunately, the approach to involve the lay person does have a single weakness, and that is the excessive sexuality. Can we just take it at someone's word that people are deeply in love and leave something to the imagination? Sexing up Shakespeare (no pun intended) in this way just seems purely sensational, the only really problematic aspect in the film.There are those who would call Shakespeare the greatest writer and thinker in history and there are those who would call him a hack. Thankfully, those of us in the first category can enjoy this olive branch to the second. Truly entertaining and important, and with a respect for its source and its audience, this Othello is hard to beat.",5,Great Adaptation--Wonderful Cast,1066608000,"10 20, 2003",2003,2898,"['am', 'confused', 'many', 'editorial', 'site', 'incarnation', 'Othello', 'mind', 'nearly', 'perfect', 'Sure', 'ca', ""n't"", 'encapsulate', 'everything', 'Shakespeare', 'intended', 'true', 'themes', 'jealousy', 'obsession', 'power', 'featured', 'fantastic', 'acting', 'production', 'values.What', 'can', 'say', 'Othello', ""n't"", 'already', 'been', 'said', 'dozens', 'dissertations', 'already', 'one', 'big', 'four', 'Hamlet', 'Macbeth', 'King', 'Lear', 'Othello', 'remained', 'benchmark', 'tragedies', 'centuries', 'people', 'might', 'scoff', 'film', 'intent', 'make', 'Shakespeare', 'accessible', 'lay', 'viewer', 'truly', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'story', 'interfere', 'Shakespeare', 'always', 'delightful', 'prose', 'short', 'movie', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'one', 'might', 'have.The', 'cast', 'wonderful', 'pre-Matrix', 'Lawrence', 'Fishburne', 'Moor', 'Irene', 'Jakob', 'Desdemona', 'infallible', 'Kenneth', 'Branaugh', 'Iago', 'Shakespeare', 'most', 'complex', 'calculating', 'villain', 'Often', 'Shakespeare', 'plays', 'villain', 'more', 'interesting', 'hero', 'certainly', 'true', 'here', 'steals', 'scene', 'coldly', 'malevolent', 'performance', 'asides', 'audience', 'are', 'drenched', 'dread', 'rage', 'One', 'can', 'nearly', 'pity', 'man', 'off', 'so', 'tortured', 'perhaps', 'best', 'performance', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'actor', 'period', 'Fishburne', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'nobody', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'made', ""n't"", 'stop', 'holding', 'own', 'Brannaugh', 'churning', 'out', 'iambic', 'pentameter', 'marks', 'very', 'well', 'very', 'convincing', 'when', 'acting', 'passion', 'Irene', 'Jakob', 'not', 'necessarily', 'choice', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'Desdemona', 'would', 'have', 'chosen', 'someone', 'more', 'coquettish', 'personality', 'However', 'fact', 'loyalty', 'question', 'actually', 'story', 'showing', 'how', 'obviously', 'irrationally', 'jealous', 'Othello', 'becomes.The', 'production', 'first-rate', 'sets', 'sounds', 'costumes', 'etc', 'are', 'fantastic', 'One', 'really', 'you-are-there', 'feeling', 'as', 'corny', 'watching', 'movie', 'overstylized', 'awful', 'postmodern', 'Shakespeare', 'interpretations', 'refreshing', 'see', 'world', 'Shakespeare', 'envisioned', 'it.Unfortunately', 'approach', 'involve', 'lay', 'person', 'have', 'single', 'weakness', 'excessive', 'sexuality', 'Can', 'just', 'take', 'someone', 'word', 'people', 'are', 'deeply', 'love', 'leave', 'something', 'imagination', 'Sexing', 'up', 'Shakespeare', 'pun', 'intended', 'way', 'just', 'purely', 'sensational', 'only', 'really', 'problematic', 'aspect', 'film.There', 'are', 'who', 'would', 'call', 'Shakespeare', 'greatest', 'writer', 'thinker', 'history', 'are', 'who', 'would', 'call', 'hack', 'Thankfully', 'first', 'category', 'can', 'enjoy', 'olive', 'branch', 'second', 'Truly', 'entertaining', 'important', 'respect', 'source', 'audience', 'Othello', 'hard', 'beat']",N/A
545846,A1S26JXPQKFVPI,B00003OST5,Alexander Arsov,"[3, 3]","Oliver Parker's movie is visually impressive and makes a fine use of the many advantages offered by modern cinema. The diversity of locations is wonderful, the sets and the costumes are sumptuous historical affairs, the direction nearly perfect, with lots of fine close-ups. The play is much cut, of course, but most of the finest passages - Iago's soliloquies, Othello's final speech - are retained, although the action may seem a little rushed from time to time.I am dismayed to see the movie accused of ''excessive sexuality''. There is no such thing. There are some steamy scenes, certainly, but all of them, the consummation of Othello's marriage and his fantasies about Cassio and Desdemona, are crucial to the plot - unless one takes a prudish point of view that hardly suits Shakespeare. All sex scenes, of course, are very stylishly done. For my part they add a special flavour which makes the whole story more convincing. It might be argued, however, that this shifts Othello's feelings too much to the carnal side. Then again, this is an adaptation, and it should be expected to take liberties with the original.The cast is the real problem in this movie.Laurence Fishburne looks fine for Othello, and he is an excellent actor, but his delivery of the text is problematic. Only in the final scene he finally manages to convey something of the Moor's innate nobility of soul. But in many other places - the Venetian senate, the brawl - he completely fails to project Othello's natural authority. All too often his delivery of the poetry sounds too mechanical, too calculated, too artificial. He seems much too concerned about his pronunciation, but not enough about the meaning of the words; the Welles Syndrome, only much aggravated. When there is no talking - the epileptic fit, the first jealous thoughts, the smothering of Desdemona - Fishburne delivers passionate and compelling performances.Irene Jacob is an even greater disappointment. Leaving aside that her large features don't fit my personal ideas of feminine loveliness, she is even more stilted and wooden than Fishburne. Even in the final scene she doesn't manage to do anything memorable. Then again, as I said, her character is hardly worth bothering about. One nice little change of the original is Desdemona's recovery of consciousness only to die without uttering a word. Perhaps I am too harsh on the girl. Considering that this is not just her first Shakespearean experience, but first movie in English at all, she could have been much worse.Kenneth Branagh completely steals the show. That's to be expected, of course. He is the only one among the principals with any experience with Shakespeare. He is almost a Shakespearean veteran: on the next year he made his ""Hamlet"" (1996), behind his back he already had ""Henry V"" (1989) and ""Much Ado About Nothing"" (1993).Now this is a tremendous interpretation of Iago. I am as much fascinated with it as I am disappointed with Branagh's Hamlet. There are no hammy histrionics here. This Iago is no cheap buffoon that makes you wonder how anybody, let alone everybody, could trust him. Branagh's acting is so convincing that one can almost believe that Iago really cares for Othello's suffering, really wants to help Roderigo, really is sorry for Cassio's loss of reputation. Indeed, in his first soliloquy Iago may almost make you feel sorry for him!Much of this fascination comes from the fact that Iago delivers all of his soliloquies directly to the camera, an approach I have always found extremely compelling. Occasionally, he also glances furtively to the camera, as if to invite you in his private machinations. One such moment is when he hugs Roderigo, who is totally taken in that the Ancient would give everything to help him. We know better: a single glance by Branagh is enough to convince us that Roderigo is already a dead man. And there is one other moment, even more effective, when Iago, while reflecting how he would turn Desdemona's virtue into a net to enmesh them all, actually blackens the camera with his own hand. Now this is brilliant, or, in another four words: great acting, great directing.My only slight disappointment with Iago, or rather with the adaptation, is that in the final scene he should lie, stabbed and probably dying, together with the other three corpses. It's not that Iago doesn't deserve death. It's just not dramatically effective. A much better solution would have been his regarding the bloodshed in the bed with an ironic smile.The supporting cast has some fine members. Michael Maloney is a great Roderigo; quite an achievement considering how ungrateful the part is. Nathaniel Parker is good if a little bland as Cassio. (Interestingly enough, both of these actors have played on the screen Laertes from Hamlet: Michael in Branagh's adaptation, 1996; Nathaniel in Zeffirelli's, 1990.) The completely unknown to me Anna Patrick, an actress with singularly square but not unattractive face, is a superb Emilia; she almost stole the final scene from Othello. Pierre Vaneck is remarkably memorable in the minor part of Brabantio. It was a pleasure to see again Gabriele Ferzetti (the Duke). Nearly three decades earlier he had become well-known as the railroad tycoon Morton from Sergio Leone's classic Once Upon a Time in the West (1968).

545848,A1PASRZ81DY9C,B00003OST5,Austin Somlo,"[1, 25]","Viewed: 12/12Rate: 112/12: To say it straight off, the works of William Shakespeare are outdated today. The English language has improved greatly over time to the point where people can say things much clearly that are naturally and fully comprehensible to the listeners' ears without even trying to decipher it. But the words put together to make coherent sentences to keep a train of thought flowing are not found in Shakespeare's works. There is a feeling of tripping, pausing, and/or puzzlement that the mind creates. Only if the language can be clearer, the struggling readers, forced by their dreadful English teachers, might have finally understood what is it the hell Shakespeare was talking about. But no...they have to retort to footnotes, Cliff's notes, and/or money to do the class for them so they can move on with their lives and hope to never touch Shakespeare again. I've read Shakespeare, and I don't see anything interesting about them; they are ordinary stories whose powers are trapped by Old English. Readers don't literally become intelligent by mastering the works of Shakespeare, but instead, they can do a lot better by reading 18th to 19th century literature where the language, even if translated into English, is abundantly clear and relevant. Now, let's take a look at Othello. The first and the foremost struggle any ordinary viewer will have is the relation to the language. The first thing he will say is, ""What the f is going on?"" I can be on his side for that. It gets worse thereafter because the entire film is going to be just like that. It's a very difficult film to sit through, making it a horrible chore to suffer from. As I've seen over two thousand films, Othello is as a bad movie as it can be. Look at great films, and look at ordinary films. The players are natural in their actions as they speak at the same time. But not in Othello. Speaking has become a challenge for everybody in the cast as there is a clear detachment in the actions from themselves. Their minds are not really into their actions similar to how people are texting and trying to multitask at the same time. That's why the acting on Othello is truly terrible. Nobody is focused on anything else but the words. The challenge of the language takes everything away from the film. Nobody looks real; their feelings are not real; and it's hard to believe in anyone's words. On the contrary, I saw O, the teenage version of Othello, and was impressed with how it was done. The acting by the cast felt more believable and realistic, and the story was almost, more or less, the same as the original. So, why did the film work better? Because of the modifications in the language. It is simple as that. All in all, Othello doesn't work.",1,Terrible Acting.,1355875200,"12 19, 2012",2012,2743,"['Viewed', '12/12Rate', '112/12', 'say', 'straight', 'off', 'works', 'William', 'Shakespeare', 'are', 'outdated', 'today', 'English', 'language', 'improved', 'greatly', 'time', 'point', 'where', 'people', 'can', 'say', 'things', 'much', 'clearly', 'are', 'naturally', 'fully', 'comprehensible', 'listeners', 'ears', 'even', 'trying', 'decipher', 'words', 'put', 'together', 'make', 'coherent', 'sentences', 'keep', 'train', 'thought', 'flowing', 'are', 'not', 'found', 'Shakespeare', 'works', 'feeling', 'tripping', 'pausing', 'and/or', 'puzzlement', 'mind', 'Only', 'language', 'can', 'be', 'clearer', 'struggling', 'readers', 'forced', 'dreadful', 'English', 'teachers', 'might', 'have', 'finally', 'understood', 'what', 'hell', 'Shakespeare', 'was', 'talking', 'have', 'retort', 'footnotes', 'Cliff', 'notes', 'and/or', 'money', 'do', 'class', 'can', 'move', 'lives', 'hope', 'never', 'touch', 'Shakespeare', 'again', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Shakespeare', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'interesting', 'are', 'ordinary', 'stories', 'powers', 'are', 'trapped', 'Old', 'English', 'Readers', 'do', ""n't"", 'literally', 'become', 'intelligent', 'mastering', 'works', 'Shakespeare', 'instead', 'can', 'do', 'lot', 'better', 'reading', '18th', '19th', 'century', 'literature', 'where', 'language', 'even', 'translated', 'English', 'abundantly', 'clear', 'relevant', 'Now', 'let', 'take', 'look', 'Othello', 'first', 'foremost', 'struggle', 'ordinary', 'viewer', 'will', 'have', 'relation', 'language', 'first', 'thing', 'will', 'say', 'What', 'f', 'going', 'can', 'be', 'side', 'worse', 'thereafter', 'entire', 'film', 'going', 'be', 'just', 'very', 'difficult', 'film', 'sit', 'making', 'horrible', 'chore', 'suffer', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'two', 'thousand', 'films', 'Othello', 'bad', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'Look', 'great', 'films', 'look', 'ordinary', 'films', 'players', 'are', 'natural', 'actions', 'speak', 'same', 'time', 'not', 'Othello', 'Speaking', 'become', 'challenge', 'everybody', 'cast', 'clear', 'detachment', 'actions', 'minds', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'actions', 'similar', 'how', 'people', 'are', 'texting', 'trying', 'multitask', 'same', 'time', 'why', 'acting', 'Othello', 'truly', 'terrible', 'Nobody', 'focused', 'anything', 'else', 'words', 'challenge', 'language', 'everything', 'away', 'film', 'Nobody', 'real', 'feelings', 'are', 'not', 'real', 'hard', 'believe', 'anyone', 'words', 'contrary', 'saw', 'O', 'teenage', 'version', 'Othello', 'was', 'impressed', 'how', 'was', 'done', 'acting', 'cast', 'felt', 'more', 'believable', 'realistic', 'story', 'was', 'almost', 'more', 'less', 'same', 'original', 'So', 'why', 'did', 'film', 'work', 'better', 'modifications', 'language', 'simple', 'Othello', ""n't"", 'work']",N/A

Yes, it's a viciously truncated version Of Shakespeare's play. But hell, this is a movie, folks. I seriously doubt you've committed the first folio to memory that well. In all honesty... nothing too important is ommitted and the taut pacing/implied sensuality makes up for The Bard's missing lines. Moreover, if you're going to chop any of Shakespeare's tragedies, this would be the one to hack at; if only because Iago's real motivations are never fully revealed... He hints at jealousy and The Moor's possible adaultery with his wife, Emilia... but those are rather too minor to warrant why he does what he does (he doesn't even like his wife that much...)I don't think Iago knows the real motivations for his villiany- he doesn't want to face himself, all the more reason to lose himself in a tangled web of inrigue... Branagh takes the role and runs with it masterfully: he's so alive and passionate when involved with the other characters and so quietly monotone and intensely sinister when delivering his soliloquies!Anyway, my amateur psych profiles aside, this is a wonderful film version.  The performances are as smoldering as they are riveting. Fishburne is his sensual best, Branagh is coldly intense and creepy, his stop-on-a-dime two-faced portrait of Iago is superb. The chick who plays Desdemona is competent, she suffers and dies well enough. The actress doing Emilia is great as well. Cassio is the dumb stud we all know and love... Everyone who's not Iago or Othello is more or less delegated to the background so the film can focus on their interaction and Iago's machinations.Well-paced and directed with great settings and locales and a lovely soundtrack that is understated in all the right places and bombastic in all the right places...If you've seen it, you know.

Shakespeare's pre-eminent interpreter in the modern day is Kenneth Branagh, and although he was not the director of this excellent version of Othello, he played the most meaty and pivotal role of Iago, the pretended friend of the tragic hero, Othello. Branagh sinks his teeth heartily into the role and does not let go. Laurence Fishburne effectively plays the ill-fated Othello with force but somehow does not quite muster the intensity and insane jealousy of his character. The beautiful French actress Irene Jacob portrays Othello's bride Desdemona, whom fate has condemned to an untimely end thanks to Iago's conniving and Othello's blind loyalty and trust in Iago. Jacob plays a very sweet and innocent Desdemona, but her command of English and her accent make her a bit hard to bear in this role. I was pleased with the choice of Fishburne for this role because Othello is supposed to be African. In a version I watched in high school Anthony Hopkins was cast in the role of Othello, and while he conveyed the appropriate rage and jealousy and blind passion for Othello, he was hideously costumed in face paints, which really seemed over the top.

It was like watching an episode of ""Moonlighting"" (If any of you remember that TV show from the 80s) where the character is constantly speaking into the camera.  Rather than letting the Audience gain insight into Iago's thoughts (which is what I believe Shakespeare intended in the soliloquies), Branagh's performance became grandstanding IMO (""Look at me.

Like for Desdemona, whose actring, poor command of English and thick French accent made me not very sad to see her die.  Or an insipid Emilia and wholey unmemorable Cassio.  Or the lack of chemistry between Desdemona and Othello; it was very difficult to tell that they were even a couple, much less so deeply in love.But, no, instead I will focus on what to me was the most glaring problem: Iago. Iago is normally my favorite character; I have seen many versions of ""Othello,"" movie and stage, and in each and every one of them I have found Iago to be the greatest Shakespeare villain ever: complex, tortured yet humorous--so intelligent and cunning that you just have to love him.  Iago is a character that the audience is supposed to like against their will: I have read tales that many actors who play Othello feel that Iago steals the limelight from him.  In the version with James Earl Jones, the audience loved Iago so much that they were booing when he was arrested--they didn't want him to get caught.However, Branagh's Iago is the first Iago that I have found to be flat, 2d, and wholly unlikeable.  I have never liked Branagh very much to begin with (his directing is terrible and what kind of director casts himself in main roles like that?); I am of the opinion that he does nothing more than chew scenery.  Indeed, in ""Othello"" he trounces around and screws up his face and laughs and performs what he thinks is good Shakespeare.  But, he lacks the charisma and charm necessary for Iago, so one never really gets attached to him.  Also, he fails to give the underlying psyche behind Iago, to explain to us how he could have done what he did.  He is shown as a dumb jerk, not remotely likable or deep at all.  I blame this on his directing (like those unnecessary added things in the scene where Emilia gives Iago the handkerchief) and, of course, mostly his acting.It's a shame, too, because Lawrence Fishbourne does a great job as ""Othello.""

545865,A3P39OB1B61D4V,B00003OST5,Laquita A. Angst,"[8, 10]","Jealousy can ruin lives and can come from years of pain or from a place indiscernible. William Shakespeare was fascinated by jealousy and what it can do to relationships. Shakespeare used his fascination with jealousy to create a gripping tragedy.  Othello is the story of two lovers ruined by an outsider consumed by jealousy. Iago, motivated by material and personal gain as well as the sheer love of evil, breeds mistrust between Othello and Desdemona. After much work, Iago brings Othello to the breaking point. He kills Desdemona because he thinks she has betrayed him. He discovers the truth only when it is too late, and atones for his sins by taking his own life.  Oliver Parker's 1995 film version of Othello opens in an obvious Venetian setting in the evening. The film is set during the Renaissance and resembles what the story would have looked like if it had really happened in Shakespeare's day. The settings and costumes are entirely realistic and elaborate. The film is done for all audiences and Parker tries to balance action and dialogue. In trying to balance the content of the film, Parker took liberties with the text, changing almost as much as he could while still keeping the title of Shakespeare's play. In discussing the film, Jack Garner claims Parker ""eliminated some 50 percent of the original play."" Though this may be true, how the story works is the most important, and Brian Webster of the Apollo Movie Guide says, ""in this film it does.""  Though all of Shakespeare's lines may not be in Parker's film version, the poetic form of Shakespeare's iambic pentameter was kept in nearly every line. Still, the delivery of the lines is crucial to the flow of a Shakespearian play. Kenneth Branagh did a masterful job delivering the lines of Iago. Branagh presented his lines in a way that conveyed his emotions and intentions and in a way that is easily understood. His body language is also highly convincing.  Though not the vision of evil that Iago epitomizes, Branagh's body movements were so convincing, I found myself loathing him almost immediately. He looks straight into the eyes of Othello as he lies to him about his pure wife. He crumbles hot ash over his fist to symbolize Othello's blackness. He touches Othello's arm with real concern. His true evil can be seen in the way he conducts himself while executing his diabolical plan. Branagh's subtle tactics reveal to the audience how easy it would be for someone like Othello to fall into Iago's trap. A review in the Shakespeare Bulletin praises Branagh saying he ""allows us, with searing gestures, to shudder at the repressed heat that burns in Iago's festering imagination"" (Crowl).  Laurence Fishburne also does a worthy job delivering his lines. Fishburne, playing the tragic hero Othello, is the jealous polar opposite of Iago. Where Iago's jealousy is unfounded, Othello's jealousy is justified in that he thinks his wife is being unfaithful. It was easy to see how tortured Othello was by his jealousy. His expressions showed his pain and his anger. Most notably, as he imagines Cassio and Desdemona together and while smothering innocent Desdemona, Fishburne's face was riddled with pain.  Imagery played a crucial role in Parker's adaptation. Things that were not included in Shakespeare's text were used to bring the audience into the story. Scenery and character actions were key to the visual treatment of the film. Still, parts of the film were based on imagery alone. The most memorable part in the film for me is two-fold. While scheming, Iago knocks two chess pieces into deep water and the camera follows the pieces as they sink. The black king and white queen fall into the water, plunging to bottom. Symbolically, the pieces represented Othello and Desdemona like game pieces Iago used and then sent to their demise. At the end of the movie, this image is replicated when the bodies of Othello and Desdemona are slid into the Mediterranean.  Though Parker took liberties in adapting Othello to film, the version was enjoyable. The essence of Shakespeare's lines was preserved in the overall sense of the production. I felt awful for Othello and Desdemona and I feared and hated Iago. To me, this shows that Parker succeeded in making Othello come to life again.  Shakespeare's stories have lasted into our time because he wrote about universal themes and believable people. His plays can be adapted to many forms and genres and still speak the same truths about people as they did 400 years ago. Shakespeare's works are often seen as plays and films, so I did not expect to find an operatic version of Othello.  Franco Zeffirelli's screen adaptation of Giuseppe Verdi's stage production of Otello is a masterpiece. Many people say that music can speak to the soul more deeply than any words ever could. I realized the total truth of this belief after watching Zeffirelli's Otello.  The film opens with a large, strong ship being tossed about on a sea of large waves. The stormy opening sets the stage for what is to happen in the rest of the story. In retrospect, the ship seems like a metaphor for Otello's downfall. Otello is a powerful man who is brought down by forces beyond his control. Other scenes in the film speak to Otello's downfall. After the wedding celebration and the fight, Otello goes to Desdemona in his bedroom. Walking down the stairs to the bedroom symbolizes Otello's fall from grace as a result of his mistrust of Desdemona. Desdemona, the innocent character who has no tragic flaw, is found in the bedroom surrounded by white linens. The linens show her innocence and purity.  Desdemona's innocence is further shown in her appearance. She is young and angelic. Her age is portrayed as vastly different from Othello in this version. Parker's adaptation did not reveal any such age difference. Otello's age in the opera ""strengthens our impression of his wisdom, restraint, and leadership"" (Bevington, 1118), while in truth Otello lets impulse dominate his wisdom and restraint.  In Zeffirelli's version, Otello seems to be jealous with regard to Cassio before Iago begins to influence Otello. This jealousy seems to be misplaced. Though it may show the audience that Otello is susceptible to believing that Desdemona has been unfaithful, it takes away from the idea that the two are totally in love. For the story to be believable, Otello must have pure love for Desdemona and have that love ruined by Iago. If the audience sees that Otello does not implicitly trust Desdemona in the beginning, then the audience cannot believe that he ever truly loved her. I am glad that I saw Parker's version before Zeffirelli's. I think that my view of the play would have been tainted just because of the way Zeffirelli treated this situation. Other than the early show of mistrust, Zeffirelli's adaptation shows a great love between Otello and Desdemona. Otello saw her as the missing part of himself. It was as if they each only had one wing and they could only fly embracing one another. Fishburne played a powerful and authoritative Othello, and seemed to be more jealous of losing his wife as property than as the other half of his soul.  Another difference between Parker's and Zeffirelli's versions is in the way that Iago's attitude is portrayed. In Zeffirelli's adaptation of Verdi's opera, Iago is filled with complete haterd that is obvious at every turn. Iago watched Otello and Desdemona with pure hatred at their wedding and follows not only them, but Cassio as well. Zeffirelli's version focuses on Iago's hatred of Cassio, which in some small way shows reason why Iago used Cassio in his plot to bring down Otello. Branagh played Othello in a way that made him evil, but Placido Domingo was evil and angry. Zeffirelli's Iago is completely remorseless and cruel.  Zeffirelli's version presented many aspects of Shakespeare's play that I feel were left out of Parker's adaptation. Though it was a challenge to watch, it was masterful and captivating. Otello is marvelous and Domingo's voice is enchanting, but no performance could out do Branagh as Iago. His body language, chemistry with the other performers and command of his lines did justice to the words of Shakespeare.  The story of Othello can be told many ways, but the essence is always the same. Jealousy can ruin a relationship: jealousy can ruin a person. Insecurity can be as damaging as jealousy. Maybe Shakespeare was warning to keep a close eye on your love. I think he was telling the world that true love trusts and those who are truly in love should never question faithfulness.",5,"Othello - Branagh, also vs. Otello",995241600,"07 16,

I watched this film and Olivier's with my roommate who is NOT an english major/afficianado and she could understand him -- go figure. Brannagh does what he does best and he isn't anything other than himself playing Iago but he is still quite enjoyable. Fishburne hasn't trained classically but still does a decent job (and he's HOT).

545870,A13UFZZWOMZA6B,B00003OST5,Peter Swift,"[20, 20]","I've always been a fan of Kenneth Branagh and both his acting and directing abilities.  However, in the film interpretation of ""Othello,"" I was blown away by how well he fit the role of Iago.  In the play, Iago has to be two-faced all the time.  He shows one side of him to one person, and another side to another.  In the film, Iago works very hard to keep up his appearance with all the different characters.  No character sees more than one side of him, and his plots are kept to himself.  Iago is an actor, and Branagh had to perform his part and I think he did it incredibly.  While talking to Othello, his facial reactions would visibly change when Othello looked the other way; the audience saw glimpses of Iago's true motives, but they were always hidden from Othello.  It was incredible how quickly the transition from a sinister expression to a loving and loyal expression was made.  In one scene, Iago and Othello are hugging, and Iago's face reflects contempt as soon as his face is beside Othello's face.Iago's changes aren't simply when Othello is around, but the changes are the same for when Iago deals with Roderigo.  In the scenes with Roderigo, Iago has to perform doubly hard because he's being partially truthful with Iago.  He's showing part of his true motives, but he still has to hide them to some extent to convince Roderigo to do his bidding.  The scenes between Branagh and Michael Maloney probably impressed me the most.  Roderigo may have been gullible or easily convinced, but Iago was still convincing and persuasive enough to move Roderigo from absolute hatred and distrust to absolute loyalty and thankfulness.  In one scene, Roderigo is threatening to kill Iago and by the end of the scene, they're hugging and Iago can barely convince Roderigo to leave his side.The biggest change that Iago undergoes is when he is caught.  In the end of the play, when Emilia finally recognizes what has happened, Iago's facial expressions finally become flat and unwavering.  He puts on a stoic face and remains that way into his death.  He no longer has to convince anyone of anything because they all know the truth, so he doesn't give anyone any idea of what he's thinking and doesn't talk or change his appearance.  This scene left a lasting impression on me, even when he was telling Emilia to be wise or when he was killing her, there is no change in his facial expression.Overall, I was impressed with the movie.  I enjoyed the acting from all the characters (not just Branagh), and I'm sure I'd enjoy watching it repeatedly.",5,Great Acting,1069372800,"11 21, 2003",2003,2553,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'acting', 'directing', 'abilities', 'However', 'film', 'interpretation', 'Othello', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'how', 'well', 'fit', 'role', 'Iago', 'play', 'Iago', 'be', 'two-faced', 'time', 'one', 'side', 'one', 'person', 'side', 'film', 'Iago', 'very', 'hard', 'keep', 'up', 'appearance', 'different', 'characters', 'character', 'more', 'one', 'side', 'plots', 'are', 'kept', 'Iago', 'actor', 'Branagh', 'had', 'perform', 'part', 'think', 'did', 'incredibly', 'talking', 'Othello', 'facial', 'reactions', 'would', 'visibly', 'change', 'when', 'Othello', 'looked', 'other', 'way', 'audience', 'saw', 'glimpses', 'Iago', 'true', 'motives', 'were', 'always', 'hidden', 'Othello', 'was', 'incredible', 'how', 'quickly', 'transition', 'sinister', 'expression', 'loving', 'loyal', 'expression', 'was', 'made', 'one', 'scene', 'Iago', 'Othello', 'are', 'hugging', 'Iago', 'face', 'contempt', 'as', 'soon', 'face', 'beside', 'Othello', 'face.Iago', 'changes', 'are', ""n't"", 'simply', 'when', 'Othello', 'around', 'changes', 'are', 'same', 'when', 'Iago', 'Roderigo', 'scenes', 'Roderigo', 'Iago', 'perform', 'doubly', 'hard', 'being', 'partially', 'truthful', 'Iago', 'showing', 'part', 'true', 'motives', 'still', 'hide', 'extent', 'convince', 'Roderigo', 'do', 'bidding', 'scenes', 'Branagh', 'Michael', 'Maloney', 'probably', 'impressed', 'most', 'Roderigo', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'gullible', 'easily', 'convinced', 'Iago', 'was', 'still', 'convincing', 'persuasive', 'enough', 'move', 'Roderigo', 'absolute', 'hatred', 'distrust', 'absolute', 'loyalty', 'thankfulness', 'one', 'scene', 'Roderigo', 'threatening', 'kill', 'Iago', 'end', 'scene', ""'re"", 'hugging', 'Iago', 'can', 'barely', 'convince', 'Roderigo', 'leave', 'side.The', 'biggest', 'change', 'Iago', 'undergoes', 'when', 'caught', 'end', 'play', 'when', 'Emilia', 'finally', 'what', 'happened', 'Iago', 'facial', 'expressions', 'finally', 'become', 'flat', 'unwavering', 'stoic', 'face', 'way', 'death', 'no', 'longer', 'convince', 'anyone', 'anything', 'know', 'truth', ""n't"", 'give', 'anyone', 'idea', 'what', 'thinking', ""n't"", 'talk', 'change', 'appearance', 'scene', 'left', 'lasting', 'impression', 'even', 'when', 'was', 'telling', 'Emilia', 'be', 'wise', 'when', 'was', 'killing', 'change', 'facial', 'expression.Overall', 'was', 'impressed', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'acting', 'characters', 'not', 'just', 'Branagh', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'d"", 'enjoy', 'watching', 'repeatedly']",N/A

His voice pitch, diction, and control are remarkable.  He clearly is the scene-stealer and he dominates this movie powerfully.On the other hand, I was disappointed with Branagh's portrayal of Iago.  In part, I have a hard time imagining Branagh's face as other than that of a cherubim.  His eyes do not have the malevolent hold that evil would dictate.  He was scheming, a Kissinger-like figure, but he never really conveys the object of his scheming--the destruction of Othello.As for the lead reviewer's criticism of the sexuality in the movie, fuggedaboutit.  Don't worry.  Your kids have seen worse on HBO.  Besides, is there anything more strongly connected than misplaced power, jealousy, and sexuality?  Haven't we found this out in our modern age?

The story itself is a slow-going, and a bit hard to follow at times. What saves the film are some good performances by a fine cast. Laurence Fishburne is good as Othello, and Irene Jacob is beautiful and powerful as Desmonda. The rest of the cast does a good job, but the standout performance is given by Kenneth Branagh as the villanous Iago.The most interesting thing about this film is how the director makes the viewer feel a part of the story by having Othello and Iago look at the camera while giving their soliliquies. It's as if the actors are ""talking"" to the viewer, and this is quite powerful.

But the true star of this screen adaptation of Shakespeare's tragedy is undoubtedly Kenneth Branagh's delightfully wicked and memorable Iago.  While some uninitiated viewers may find the Shakespearean English hard to comprehend (having the English caption turned on will help immensely), Branagh's crystal-clear delivery and performance will leave little room for confusion about what Iago is up to, and that makes for an extremely enjoyable movie-watching experience.The fact that the DVD is a bit too bare-bones (there is only the theatrical trailer, nothing else) keeps me from giving it a full 5-star rating.

Fishburne excels in the role of Othello. I'm sure that future actors in that role will be judged by how well they stand up to Fishburne's portrayal and his skill in making the words come to life. If the rest of the cast had risen to his level, this could have been one of the best ever.I did not see Branagh's Iago in the same class as Fishburne's Othello, though. The role calls for a smiling traitor, lying to Othello's face and scheming behind his back. Instead, this Iago looks more like a grinning dolt. Ir&egrave;ne Jacob's Desdemona lacked passion, as well. Oh, she was passionate enough around the marriage bed, that was fine.

I believe only a scene or two is filmed in the daylight.  The bulk of this film takes place in the dank cellars, the dark of night and the closed bedrooms where intrigue and guile rule the day.This is an unusual Shakespeare adaptation, in that nothing funky is being done with it.  There is no twist in the time setting, no song and dance, no Italian wonderment.  It is about as straight of an adaptation as I have seen.  Being this, it lacks any distinction or special genius, but it is quite an able piece of film.Laurence Fishburn is a great Othello, delivering the lines and slipping under Iago's silver spell.  He lacks a certain aura of strength generally associated with Othello, but is otherwise excellent.  Kenneth Branagh is a superior Iago, and this may be one of the best performances he has given.  He plays an excellent villain, and his performance is the one bright flare in the the film.  The dialog is well done, staying with Branagh's conversational style.  The rest of the cast are all capable players, easily recognizable from the Shakespeare on film stable.All in all, I really enjoy this film.  It is not a work of genius.  It is not amazing.
