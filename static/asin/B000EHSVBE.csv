Boston Legal is a show that everyone in my extended family just LOVES, from my 14 year old neice to my 88 year old father.

973238,A2I3TKKHF6INI6,B000EHSVBE,Connie,"[8, 9]","I had for a long time known there was this show out there, Boston Legal, and that it was supposed to be quirky and funny.  But I hesitated because A) I never much liked the little bit of The Practice that I saw, just not my cup of tea, and B)  I really was creeped out by William Shatner from the Priceline ads.Then I saw a sort of tribute to William Shatner's character, on a VH1 special, and it was funny, so I gave the show a whirl.  ONE EPISODE (of Season 3) and I was absolutely floored.  Shatner is unbelievable -- who would have thought he has this level of finesse in him?  He is hilarious, at the same time over-the-top and yet subtle and sublime.James Spader is another one I never really *loved* before - always thought he was fine but nothing special.  On Boston Legal?  WOW.  I can't remember a television character as complicated and well-fleshed-out as Alan Shore, nor one as well-acted.I wanted to write a review that would encourage people who missed the first seasons to get on board now - it's not too late.  Also people who don't like courtroom shows - this show has way more to offer than just L.A. Law or The Practice or Law and Order.This is one of those shows that makes you think the best dramatic work these days is being done on TV rather than in the movies.  And these guys put out every single week!I also heart Rene Auberjonois, who is the only character who seems wholly real and natural (not that the other characters are flawed, but they do have extreme characteristics) and HUGE thumbs up for Bergen, whom I not only didn't like in the past, but actually quite disliked on the basis of Murphy Brown.  She is hilarious in this show with impeccable timing.

The illusion of topical depth was maintained at the expense of real edginess. The characters and dramas always seemed to end in the middle of some imaginary MPAA ethical demographic. The series writers seemed to sacrifice unease for soft-pedaled rants about the environment, the death penalty, and shallow ethical conundrums.

Quido ""quidrock""","[9, 10]","LOCK AND LOAD ~ Denny Crain......Making his career in the early days of the classic, ""LA Law"" in 1987, David Kelley started as a writer for Steve Bochco, then moved on to producing.  Kelley learned a lot from Bochco, notably how much it pays to have a warped sense of humor carried into the great American landscape in the form of a television drama that's really all about comedy.  Much of the humor was delivered just through the name of the weekly offering - an example?  1991's Emmy winning - ""On the Toad Again"".  Kelley also learned how invaluable it can be to have a great ensemble cast prepared to deliver your version of insanity.Television's darling in the late `90's and early part of the decade, Kelley scored quietyl as the creator of ""Picket Fences"" and ""Chicago Hope"" and moved on to his zenith with the quirky ""Ally McBeal"".  After Ally's success, the networks burned him out of ideas by latching on too quickly to ""The Practice"" and ""Boston Public"", two more serious shows in the Boston-based genre.  Although both shows enjoyed success, his ""Girls' Club"" and ""The Law Firm"" both died quick, deserved deaths.  ""Ally"" wrapped in 2002 as it was fading, and ""Boston Public"" eked on until 2004.  Strangely, once he was down to just one survivor, the less original ""The Practice"", on shaky legs in season 7, was renewed in a surprise move by ABC.  Thank goodness.  Because it was in Season 8 that Kelley undertook a revival of his comedic genius by introducing the larger than life characters in the dying show.Sharon Stone took a 3 episode stint, Ed Asner and Betty White came back from Mary Tyler Moore fame,  Jill Clayburgh showed up from LA Law, Patrick Dempsey took a tour of duty, character actor James Spader showed up in mid-season....but the chemistry and quirky that Kelley wanted didn't start to happen until the faded and fading William Shatner (once a Captain, now with Priceline) came to the show, prepared to be as over the top as aging lawyer Denny Crane, as Kelley would let him.  They added James Spader back to the mix for the final two shows, and ""Boston Legal"" was born.I didn't pay much attention to ""BL"" for the first couple of shows, and then the buzz began about the Spader/Shatner mix, and a show ostensibly about civil law began to take shape.  Kelley returned to writing, instead of just the production end, and enticed television legend Candice Bergen (5 Emmy's 2 Golden Globes) into the show at mid-year as Shirley Schmidt.Boston Legal has wonderful chemistry.  Spader's Alan Shore may be the smarmiest lead character ever on television, but he's a great attorney.  He's also wonderfully patient with Shatner's Denny Crane, who is himself a lawsuit waiting to happen.  Both of them are allowed to let the veil slip from time to time by referring to ""this episode"" or ""next week's episode"".  There is a landmark scene in, I believe most or all of the episodes, where the two share a city vista and a cigar and the audience looks onto them from the back, enjoying the humor.  And although there are some outrageous bits in this part of the show, they are coupled with Kelley's ability to convey camaraderie and respect between the two attorneys.  Bergen gets to be the voice of reason, the only one who seems able to exercise a bit of control over the two.  Twisted and a bit vile, Alan Shore and Denny Crane are perfect with comedic timing and deadpan when they need to be.There's a fabulous supporting cast for Legal, and each of them gets to portray both the serious and the funny side of the script, while showcasing the leads.  And what a wonderful list of guest stars grace the first season:  The Rev. Al Sharpton (yes,really!), Dana Delaney, Betty White, Chi McBride, Sharon Lawrence, Henry Gibson, Freddie Prinze, Jr and Shelley Long took turns.Despite having its Sunday run cut short by Grey's Anatomy, being aired a couple of times on Friday night, and finally having the last 5 episodes relegated to the next season (there are only 17 in this DVD set) ""Boston Legal"" may not have outdrawn ""Desperate Housewives"" or ""Lost"", but it was arguably the best show on ABC and probably  on TV in the 2004-2005 season.  And for as long as Kelley is writing and Spader and Shatner are carousing as larger than life, it may continue that run.Highlights of this DVD set?

Suddenly, around mid-season, Sally is gone. Also, Lori and Brad are practically excluded from the show, to the point of not appearing in whole episodes (or just for a few seconds). Tara survives just a bit longer because of her relationship with Shore.Such sudden change to characters that I was beginning to like a lot seemd due to some kind of professioanl trouble in the set.

We have the DVD's sitting on the cabinet next to the TV. When the usual garbage comes on we resort to the Boston Legal DVD's. and watch the next episode or two.

973274,A260X99UW6HA9Z,B000EHSVBE,Prauge Traveler,"[8, 8]","Boston Legal is a very funny show about a group of lawyers, all of whom are eccentric to a slight or great degree.  What is very impressive is that in any given episode you'll find yourself laughing at the humor, while you're also thinking about some of the issues the show raises: defending guilty persons, the pharmaceutical industry, foreign policy, mad cow disease, and more.  It really manages to encompass some issues that you'd never think possible.  The cast of characters is also very impressive, from James Spader to Candice Bergen to William Shatner and their supporting cast: all make a significant contribution.James Spader seems to be a central character who is as easy to dislike as he is to admire for his ruthless candor and sarcasm.  Watching Spader spare with the Firm's managers is the source of a lot of humor and Candice Bergen and Shatner have his weird yet entertaining sexual tension, and is fun to see how she reacts to the insanity of her firm.I never thought I would see William Shatner outside of a spaceship chasing space-women; and when I first heard of the former Captain Kirk appearing in a show about lawyers in Boston, I thought the idea sounded preposterous.  However, Denny Crain pulls it off with flying colors.  Shatner does an excellent job as the slightly crazy senior partner, and his humor- I think in part derived from his former stereotype, is one of the shows great points.All in all, after the first few episodes you won't be able to help yourself- Boston Legal is some great TV.",4,Boston Legal Manages Humor and the Issues,1150502400,"06 17, 2006",2006,1526,"['Boston', 'Legal', 'very', 'funny', 'show', 'group', 'lawyers', 'whom', 'are', 'eccentric', 'slight', 'great', 'degree', 'What', 'very', 'impressive', 'given', 'episode', ""'ll"", 'find', 'laughing', 'humor', ""'re"", 'also', 'thinking', 'issues', 'show', 'defending', 'guilty', 'persons', 'pharmaceutical', 'industry', 'foreign', 'policy', 'mad', 'cow', 'disease', 'more', 'really', 'encompass', 'issues', ""'d"", 'never', 'think', 'possible', 'cast', 'characters', 'also', 'very', 'impressive', 'James', 'Spader', 'Candice', 'Bergen', 'William', 'Shatner', 'supporting', 'cast', 'make', 'significant', 'contribution.James', 'Spader', 'be', 'central', 'character', 'who', 'as', 'easy', 'dislike', 'admire', 'ruthless', 'candor', 'sarcasm', 'Watching', 'Spader', 'spare', 'Firm', 'managers', 'source', 'lot', 'humor', 'Candice', 'Bergen', 'Shatner', 'have', 'weird', 'yet', 'entertaining', 'sexual', 'tension', 'fun', 'see', 'how', 'insanity', 'firm.I', 'never', 'thought', 'would', 'see', 'William', 'Shatner', 'spaceship', 'chasing', 'space-women', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'former', 'Captain', 'Kirk', 'appearing', 'show', 'lawyers', 'Boston', 'thought', 'idea', 'sounded', 'preposterous', 'However', 'Denny', 'Crain', 'off', 'flying', 'colors', 'Shatner', 'excellent', 'job', 'slightly', 'crazy', 'senior', 'partner', 'humor-', 'think', 'part', 'derived', 'former', 'stereotype', 'one', 'shows', 'great', 'points.All', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'help', 'yourself-', 'Boston', 'Legal', 'great', 'TV']",Boston Legal - Season One

Things really hit their stride when Candice Bergen joins the cast in episode 11, ""Schmidt Happens,"" as the (until then, a mystery) third named partner of the firm. Her witty interplay with William Shatner's Denny Crane and James Spader's Alan Shore is likely a big part of their Emmy success. So are the duo's sometimes tense, sometimes funny scenes with Rene Auberjonois, whose resolute Paul Lewiston grounds the show and the firm in reality.But Shatner and Spader are the cornerstones of the show, and this abbreviated season (only 17 episodes--the rest were rolled into season two when Grey's Anatomy took off in the old Boston Legal timeslot) shows how the writers and producers became aware of their remarkable chemistry and learned to harness it. Those already familiar with the second season will watch with knowing glee as the show-ending conversation between the two becomes a standard.Sadly, I can only give this collection four stars out of five because the early episodes are a bit weaker than the later ones, and because the end of the season (an episode about a death penalty case in Texas) is so abrupt. The latter is a forgiveable offense--the show's producers didnt know it would have to serve as a finale--but it still results in the set leaving a weird taste in your mouth when you finish watching.Still, a good beginning for a great series.",4,Grows Into a Gem,1150675200,"06 19, 2006",2006,1839,"['came', 'Boston', 'Legal', 'little', 'late', 'game', 'started', 'watching', '2005-2006', 'season', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'show', 'get', 'rolling', 'seeing', 'how', 'grew', 'quirky', 'little', 'legal', 'series', 'engaging', 'half-comedy', 'half', 'drama', 'become.Some', 'characters', 'early', 'episodes', 'may', 'grate', 'Lake', 'Bell', 'character', 'mind', 'time', 'partly-animated', 'credits', 'are', 'gone', 'fifth', 'episode', 'show', 'running', 'Things', 'really', 'hit', 'stride', 'when', 'Candice', 'Bergen', 'cast', 'episode', '11', 'Schmidt', 'Happens', 'then', 'mystery', 'third', 'named', 'partner', 'firm', 'witty', 'interplay', 'William', 'Shatner', 'Denny', 'Crane', 'James', 'Spader', 'Alan', 'Shore', 'likely', 'big', 'part', 'Emmy', 'success', 'are', 'duo', 'sometimes', 'tense', 'sometimes', 'funny', 'scenes', 'Rene', 'Auberjonois', 'resolute', 'Paul', 'Lewiston', 'show', 'firm', 'reality.But', 'Shatner', 'Spader', 'are', 'cornerstones', 'show', 'abbreviated', 'season', 'only', '17', 'episodes', 'rest', 'were', 'rolled', 'season', 'two', 'when', 'Grey', 'Anatomy', 'took', 'off', 'old', 'Boston', 'Legal', 'timeslot', 'how', 'writers', 'producers', 'became', 'aware', 'remarkable', 'chemistry', 'learned', 'harness', 'already', 'familiar', 'second', 'season', 'will', 'watch', 'knowing', 'glee', 'show-ending', 'conversation', 'two', 'standard.Sadly', 'can', 'only', 'give', 'collection', 'four', 'five', 'early', 'episodes', 'are', 'bit', 'weaker', 'later', 'ones', 'end', 'season', 'episode', 'death', 'penalty', 'case', 'Texas', 'so', 'abrupt', 'latter', 'forgiveable', 'offense', 'show', 'producers', 'didnt', 'know', 'would', 'have', 'serve', 'finale', 'still', 'results', 'set', 'leaving', 'weird', 'taste', 'mouth', 'when', 'finish', 'watching.Still', 'good', 'beginning', 'great', 'series']",Boston Legal - Season One

Whether this was always creator/executive producer David E. Kelley's original intent remains unseen, but it was a tactically shrewd and smart move, nonetheless. Sporting a great cast, sharp writing, relevant topical issues, laugh-out-loud humor and remarkable heart, Boston Legal (original working title ""Fleet Street"") continued to do what The Practice did for legal dramas, only in a much more humorous way.Props to Fox for packaging the show in a first-rate DVD season set which features immaculate picture and sound and cool extras. Most notably, the deleted scenes from the pilot which Kelley explains in the introduction as being too ""Practice-like"" i.e. serious. These aren't the usual abruptly short deleted scenes typical of TV DVDs but full ""super-size"" scenes that add more to the pilot episode they were cut from, not unlike the deleted scenes from NBC'sThe Office.Boston Legal - Season One is a 5-disc  (single-sided) set featuring all 17 episodes; Widescreen (1.78:1) video; Dolby Surround English audio; plus extras.

973287,AALQF8508VLZG,B000EHSVBE,T.D. Ferguson,"[5, 8]","To the reviewers who lambaste this show for it's obvious and pervasive non-realism, perhaps you have missed the point.  I am an attorney.  I have taken two bar exams and am thus all too familiar with the rules of evidence, constitutional law, civil procedure, criminal law, criminal procedure, family law, torts and contracts.  I only mention these areas because they are the only areas this show deals with (apart from an occasional mention of M & A and other corporate practices) and are consequently the areas that this show fudges severely.  Almost nothing about the way lawsuits are brought or the way they proceed is realistic in any way shape or form in this program.  Further, if Crane, Poole & Schmidt is the gargantuan law firm the viewer is led to believe it is, associate Alan Shore would not be able to pick whatever random criminal, tort or constitutional case he feels like trying.  Also, neither the partners nor any other associates would involve themselves in ANY criminal or family law matters unless in a pro bono capacity.  Going even further, no attorney in the firm, partner or otherwise would be able to continually get away with shooting people.  Oh, and while we're on the subject, partners would not be able to fondle members of the opposite sex in the office and attorneys who were sleeping with each other would probably be disciplined for discussing their relations or having sex in the office whilst others can see or hear.  It is also likely that sex dolls would be disallowed, whether or not they were made in the likeness of one of the named partners.  Since we're on the topic of unrealism, another common trait shared among real-world firms that operate on the national and international scale comparable to this make-believe firm is that the named partners are usually dead.  You may be able, from time to time find a lawyer named Foley, Larder, Arnold, Porter, Snell, Wilmer, Cutler, Pickering, King, Spalding etc., but it's quite rare that this lawyer is the one who founded the firm that carries his/her namesake.  The show is set in a fake TV world.  Here's a few other shows set in a fake TV world where nothing resembles realism:House (Hugh Laurie is really English!!)The Cosby Show (Bill Cosby was really a comedian, not a doctor!!)ERChicago HopeLaw and OrderLaw and Order SVULaw and Order CILaw and Order XR4TILaw and Order S&M;Law and Order ABCLaw and Order USALaw and Order MIALaw and Order DDPLaw and Order DDTCSI MiamiCSI New YorkCSI PoughkeepsieCSI MariettaCSI Green BayCSI NewfoundlandCSI SiberiaMediumLargeXtra LargeSmallAll are (or were) hit shows.  All have very little basis in reality.  The difference between Boston Legal and the other ""legal"" dramas is Boston Legal flaunts its lack of realism.  It almost seems as if David E. Kelley is poking fun at his own work to some degree as well as the various Law and Order franchises.  True, there are many points in every episode in which the characters (most often Alan Shore) pontificate and make profound discoveries, but in the interim, the show does not take itself too seriously.  So therefore I love it, even though I know it is wrong.  I contrast the Law and Order series, which is equally unrealistic, yet does take itself all too seriously, constantly pretending that it is not pretending even though the show's version of basic rules of law is no less outlandish than Denny Crane firing off a shotgun in a courtroom.  In short, Boston Legal is good.  The actors deliver because the teleplays deliver and the insincere treatment of law and procedure can be excused by the sincere treatment of the topics as well as the laughs.  I would encourage anyone to buy this set and view it periodically (just perhaps not with your kids if they're under 16).",5,The great and bloated Captain Kirk,1204934400,"03 8, 2008",2008,3760,"['reviewers', 'who', 'lambaste', 'show', 'obvious', 'pervasive', 'non-realism', 'perhaps', 'have', 'missed', 'point', 'am', 'attorney', 'have', 'taken', 'two', 'bar', 'exams', 'am', 'thus', 'too', 'familiar', 'rules', 'evidence', 'constitutional', 'law', 'civil', 'procedure', 'criminal', 'law', 'criminal', 'procedure', 'family', 'law', 'torts', 'contracts', 'only', 'mention', 'areas', 'are', 'only', 'areas', 'show', 'apart', 'occasional', 'mention', 'M', 'A', 'other', 'corporate', 'practices', 'are', 'consequently', 'areas', 'show', 'severely', 'Almost', 'nothing', 'way', 'lawsuits', 'are', 'brought', 'way', 'proceed', 'realistic', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'program', 'Further', 'Crane', 'Poole', 'Schmidt', 'gargantuan', 'law', 'firm', 'viewer', 'led', 'believe', 'associate', 'Alan', 'Shore', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'pick', 'random', 'criminal', 'tort', 'constitutional', 'case', 'trying', 'Also', 'partners', 'other', 'associates', 'would', 'involve', 'ANY', 'criminal', 'family', 'law', 'matters', 'pro', 'bono', 'capacity', 'Going', 'even', 'further', 'attorney', 'firm', 'partner', 'otherwise', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'continually', 'get', 'away', 'shooting', 'people', 'Oh', ""'re"", 'subject', 'partners', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'fondle', 'members', 'opposite', 'sex', 'office', 'attorneys', 'who', 'were', 'sleeping', 'other', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'disciplined', 'discussing', 'relations', 'having', 'sex', 'office', 'whilst', 'others', 'can', 'see', 'hear', 'also', 'likely', 'sex', 'dolls', 'would', 'be', 'disallowed', 'not', 'were', 'made', 'likeness', 'one', 'named', 'partners', ""'re"", 'topic', 'unrealism', 'common', 'trait', 'shared', 'real-world', 'firms', 'operate', 'national', 'international', 'scale', 'comparable', 'make-believe', 'firm', 'named', 'partners', 'are', 'usually', 'dead', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'time', 'time', 'find', 'lawyer', 'named', 'Foley', 'Larder', 'Arnold', 'Porter', 'Snell', 'Wilmer', 'Cutler', 'Pickering', 'King', 'Spalding', 'etc.', 'quite', 'rare', 'lawyer', 'one', 'who', 'founded', 'firm', 'his/her', 'namesake', 'show', 'set', 'fake', 'TV', 'world', 'Here', 'few', 'other', 'shows', 'set', 'fake', 'TV', 'world', 'where', 'nothing', 'realism', 'House', 'Hugh', 'Laurie', 'really', 'English', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'was', 'really', 'comedian', 'not', 'doctor', 'ERChicago', 'HopeLaw', 'OrderLaw', 'Order', 'SVULaw', 'Order', 'CILaw', 'Order', 'XR4TILaw', 'Order', 'S', 'M', 'Law', 'Order', 'ABCLaw', 'Order', 'USALaw', 'Order', 'MIALaw', 'Order', 'DDPLaw', 'Order', 'DDTCSI', 'MiamiCSI', 'New', 'YorkCSI', 'PoughkeepsieCSI', 'MariettaCSI', 'Green', 'BayCSI', 'NewfoundlandCSI', 'SiberiaMediumLargeXtra', 'LargeSmallAll', 'are', 'were', 'hit', 'shows', 'have', 'very', 'little', 'basis', 'reality', 'difference', 'Boston', 'Legal', 'other', 'legal', 'dramas', 'Boston', 'Legal', 'lack', 'realism', 'almost', 'David', 'E.', 'Kelley', 'poking', 'fun', 'own', 'work', 'degree', 'as', 'well', 'various', 'Law', 'Order', 'franchises', 'True', 'are', 'many', 'points', 'episode', 'characters', 'most', 'often', 'Alan', 'Shore', 'pontificate', 'make', 'profound', 'discoveries', 'interim', 'show', 'not', 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'therefore', 'love', 'even', 'know', 'wrong', 'contrast', 'Law', 'Order', 'series', 'equally', 'unrealistic', 'yet', 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'constantly', 'pretending', 'not', 'pretending', 'even', 'show', 'version', 'basic', 'rules', 'law', 'less', 'outlandish', 'Denny', 'Crane', 'firing', 'off', 'shotgun', 'courtroom', 'short', 'Boston', 'Legal', 'good', 'actors', 'deliver', 'teleplays', 'deliver', 'insincere', 'treatment', 'law', 'procedure', 'can', 'be', 'excused', 'sincere', 'treatment', 'topics', 'as', 'well', 'laughs', 'would', 'encourage', 'anyone', 'buy', 'set', 'view', 'periodically', 'just', 'perhaps', 'not', 'kids', ""'re"", '16']",Boston Legal - Season One

The cases that are brought to the show every episode range from the topics that concern us every day all the way to some of the most bizzare that you never would beleive even existed in the real world. The best part about this show is the cast. This is a show that has brought famous names you probably haven't heard about in years. From Candice Bergen, Betty White the great William Shattner and James Spader who came out of no where! Each one gives a fantastic performance every time. The show also brings famous guest stars on to the show so there is never a dull moment.I am so excited to get this dvd because it is one of the few televison shows on today that really gets the crowd going and keeps you excited for the next episode. I just hope that after the second season we will be seeing more of this show for years to come.",5,The best show on TV you're probably not watching.

You may not understand the fan base at first, but this is a great show. I mean I HATE soap operas, but somehow, someway, they fit just enough soap opera in here and just enough of everything else that I just love this show.

973293,A1D45ZHOPX3HW5,B000EHSVBE,Zombiequest,"[6, 78]","Forget the X-Files, CSI, Kolchak the Night Stalker.. you want to see the Creepiest show on television.. you got it right here. I've tried my damndest to get into this show, being somewhat of a lewd male myself, but even I can't get passed the idea that for every case they take on there should be equal or greater the number of sexual harrasment suits during every single episode! That's not what makes it ""creepy"".. granted, a little sexual tension is amusing when it's portrayed by attractive actors or actresses that show a good deal of ""CHARISMA"".. the characters that Spader and Shatner play are not only visualy repulsive in their bloated forms, they also portray their characters as stuffy, Nueotic and flat out Weird.. which doesn't make it appealing when they molest a client or two, it simply makes them Creepy! You can almost imagine this is how Ted Bundy must've appealed to his contacts. In one episode they actually had Shatner and another partner played by Robert Wagner simultaneaously feeling up Jeri Ryan as she squirmed helplessly in the courtroom as a defendant (DURING A CASE) And exactly HOW in God's name is this suppose to be funny?? Especially to families that have any idea of what good taste is??? (I've read reviews were people talk about their kids ejoying it... great, you're raising future molestors - of COURSE they're interested!) Of course getting back to that scene, even though Jeri squirms for her life in the defendant's chair between two disgusting bloated old farts, she accepts the attention of Spader instead.. who always has the look on his face like he just slaughtered three co-workers, drank their blood and is trying to get the one he's talking to not to look down because he's wearing their skull as a Jock strap... How in God's name did a show get people this addicted when the leads are complete psychotics? At least they have Julie Bowen to drool over.. if you can take the creepy shivers the rest of the cast gives you.",1,Absolute CREEPIEST Show on Television!,1164499200,"11 26, 2006",2006,1971,"['Forget', 'X-Files', 'CSI', 'Kolchak', 'Night', 'Stalker..', 'want', 'see', 'Creepiest', 'show', 'television..', 'got', 'right', 'here', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'damndest', 'get', 'show', 'being', 'somewhat', 'lewd', 'male', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'passed', 'idea', 'case', 'take', 'should', 'be', 'equal', 'greater', 'number', 'sexual', 'harrasment', 'suits', 'single', 'episode', 'not', 'what', 'creepy', '..', 'granted', 'little', 'sexual', 'tension', 'amusing', 'when', 'portrayed', 'attractive', 'actors', 'actresses', 'show', 'good', 'deal', 'CHARISMA', 'characters', 'Spader', 'Shatner', 'play', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'visualy', 'repulsive', 'bloated', 'forms', 'also', 'portray', 'characters', 'stuffy', 'Nueotic', 'flat', 'out', 'Weird..', ""n't"", 'make', 'appealing', 'when', 'molest', 'client', 'two', 'simply', 'Creepy', 'can', 'almost', 'imagine', 'how', 'Ted', 'Bundy', 'must', ""'ve"", 'appealed', 'contacts', 'one', 'episode', 'actually', 'had', 'Shatner', 'partner', 'played', 'Robert', 'Wagner', 'simultaneaously', 'feeling', 'up', 'Jeri', 'Ryan', 'squirmed', 'helplessly', 'courtroom', 'defendant', 'DURING', 'CASE', 'exactly', 'HOW', 'God', 'name', 'suppose', 'be', 'funny', 'Especially', 'families', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'good', 'taste', ""'ve"", 'read', 'reviews', 'were', 'people', 'talk', 'kids', 'ejoying', 'great', ""'re"", 'raising', 'future', 'molestors', 'COURSE', ""'re"", 'interested', 'course', 'getting', 'back', 'scene', 'even', 'Jeri', 'squirms', 'life', 'defendant', 'chair', 'two', 'disgusting', 'bloated', 'old', 'farts', 'attention', 'Spader', 'instead..', 'who', 'always', 'look', 'face', 'just', 'slaughtered', 'three', 'co-workers', 'drank', 'blood', 'trying', 'get', 'one', 'talking', 'not', 'look', 'down', 'wearing', 'skull', 'Jock', 'strap', 'How', 'God', 'name', 'did', 'show', 'get', 'people', 'addicted', 'when', 'leads', 'are', 'complete', 'psychotics', 'least', 'have', 'Julie', 'Bowen', 'drool', 'over..', 'can', 'take', 'creepy', 'rest', 'cast']",Boston Legal - Season One
