1485699,A39650P2CZUUC9,B005LAIIHG,,"[7, 9]","I usually don't review movies.  I stick to books.  However, with The Life of Pi, I am choosing to make an exception.  It is so darn good and so close to the book that I feel it deserves a review that reflects how wonderful it is.The Life of Pi is about and adult man named Pi who has a visitor in Canada who has met his uncle in India.  His uncle told the visitor that after speaking to Pi, he will believe in God.  Pi has a story to tell and he chooses to tell the story to the visitor who has the time to listen.Years ago, Pi's parents owned a zoo in India that started going bankrupt.  They decided to sell the zoo but take the animals to Canada and perhaps make a fresh start there.  The animals and Pi's family are loaded on a cheap ship like a poor man's Noah's Ark.  The animals are all tranquilized and kept in the basement of the ship so they won't get seasick.  A storm occurs and Pi and everyone else on the ship go overboard.  Pi finds himself on a lifeboat with a tiger named Richard Parker, a post-natal orangutang, and an injured zebra.  Together they start a stupendous journey through the Pacific waters.Most of the movie's renderings of Richard Parker were done by computer graphics and it's a mighty fine job they did.  We see how Pi and Richard Parker vie for space on the tiny boat and how, daily, Pi fears for his life as a tiger's meal.The movies has some strong philosophical and theological issues that play out beautifully and it is one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time.  I am very impressed at how close the movie is to the book.  Usually, I get very annoyed because movies and the books they are made from have very little in common.  Not so with The Life of Pi.  It is a beautiful book, a beautiful movie, and the two mesh together as one.I recommend that everyone see this movie.  I saw it in 3-D and that was quite an experience.  However, I get migraines and the 3-D was a bit overboard (no pun intended) for me.  Someone told me that the actor who played the young Pacine had never acted before.  If so, he is a natural, and a wonder to boot.There isn't a spare word in the movie, nor a spare scene.  It is beautiful, thoughtful, and we finish the movie asking ourselves whether God exists.",5,The Book and The Movie Each Elevate One Another,1353715200,"11 24, 2012",2012,2241,"['usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'review', 'movies', 'stick', 'books', 'However', 'Life', 'Pi', 'am', 'choosing', 'make', 'exception', 'so', 'darn', 'good', 'so', 'close', 'book', 'feel', 'review', 'how', 'wonderful', 'is.The', 'Life', 'Pi', 'adult', 'man', 'named', 'Pi', 'who', 'visitor', 'Canada', 'who', 'met', 'uncle', 'India', 'uncle', 'told', 'visitor', 'speaking', 'Pi', 'will', 'believe', 'God', 'Pi', 'story', 'tell', 'tell', 'story', 'visitor', 'who', 'time', 'listen.Years', 'ago', 'Pi', 'parents', 'owned', 'zoo', 'India', 'started', 'going', 'bankrupt', 'decided', 'sell', 'zoo', 'take', 'animals', 'Canada', 'perhaps', 'make', 'fresh', 'start', 'there', 'animals', 'Pi', 'family', 'are', 'loaded', 'cheap', 'ship', 'poor', 'man', 'Noah', 'Ark', 'animals', 'are', 'tranquilized', 'kept', 'basement', 'ship', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'seasick', 'storm', 'occurs', 'Pi', 'everyone', 'else', 'ship', 'go', 'overboard', 'Pi', 'lifeboat', 'tiger', 'named', 'Richard', 'Parker', 'post-natal', 'orangutang', 'injured', 'zebra', 'Together', 'start', 'stupendous', 'journey', 'Pacific', 'waters.Most', 'movie', 'renderings', 'Richard', 'Parker', 'were', 'done', 'computer', 'graphics', 'mighty', 'fine', 'job', 'did', 'see', 'how', 'Pi', 'Richard', 'Parker', 'vie', 'space', 'tiny', 'boat', 'how', 'daily', 'Pi', 'life', 'tiger', 'meal.The', 'movies', 'strong', 'philosophical', 'theological', 'issues', 'play', 'out', 'beautifully', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'am', 'very', 'impressed', 'how', 'close', 'movie', 'book', 'Usually', 'get', 'very', 'annoyed', 'movies', 'books', 'are', 'made', 'have', 'very', 'little', 'common', 'Not', 'so', 'Life', 'Pi', 'beautiful', 'book', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'two', 'mesh', 'together', 'one.I', 'recommend', 'everyone', 'see', 'movie', 'saw', '3-D', 'was', 'quite', 'experience', 'However', 'get', 'migraines', '3-D', 'was', 'bit', 'overboard', 'pun', 'intended', 'Someone', 'told', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'young', 'Pacine', 'had', 'never', 'acted', 'before', 'so', 'natural', 'wonder', 'boot.There', ""n't"", 'spare', 'word', 'movie', 'spare', 'scene', 'beautiful', 'thoughtful', 'finish', 'movie', 'asking', 'God']",N/A

1485708,APZAJ6LGXH02F,B005LAIIHG,Ace Reader,"[12, 17]","Director Ang Lee has created a visually stunning, highly evolved computer-generated, emotional masterpiece in his film ""Life of Pi"".But I must warn, this film is not for the faint of heart! It's NOT a cuddly children's movie about a boy and his tiger. I do not recommend this film to any young impressionable children. It is a tragic story of loss, survival and a struggle to cheat death at sea. Belief in God and religion are spoken of with heart-felt emotion and pain. Beautiful but possibly scary imagery of the sinking of a huge ship, sharks and scary fish at sea could cause young children nightmares. This is a captivating, chilling and powerful film. ""CGI"" animals are seen in extremely stressful situations and even die in this film.*While I viewed this film a nice family consisting of two parents with two young children were seated right in front of me. Not far into this film during a stressful zebra action scene, I witnessed the little girl (maybe about ten years old), jumping out of her seat crying running out of the auditorium with her mother hot on her trail. The father and small son were left behind. Soon, they too left never to return. So beware.""Life of Pi"" is also sad and extremely dramatic with excellent acting from it's entire cast but most notably that of Suraj Sharma. Wow, can this young man act! He carried almost all of this entire film acting against an invisible tiger. I think he should receive a best actor nomination for his wonderful job!Lady's bring lots of tissues in your purse because ""Life of Pi"" made me cry several times throughout it's two hours six minute running time.I thoroughly enjoyed this fine film! I do highly recommend ""Life of Pi"", but only for much older children and adults.

But I don't think a person's understanding of a film should be contingent on reading and completely grasping the novel prior.The special effects were dazzling in and of themselves but they were distracting to the overall story line. Jellyfish don't fluoresce to the point of creating a ""glow stick"" effect making everything visible in the middle of the night in the middle of the ocean. Meerkats don't live on some ""bionic island"" in the Pacific nor do they sleep in trees. They burrow in the ground and live in Africa. So many times the water was way too calm and it was obvious they were filming (several) segments in a pool and it was obviously synthetic.From other people's reviews it seems that the second story that involved real people was what really happened. But what felt so deflated was how so much attention and detail were devoted to the fantasy of story #1 that when the second story was told in a mere forty seconds - I felt so ripped off. Maybe a brief visual or some flashbacks capturing the violent/turbulent time with the human survivors might have made it more salvageable. It came off as poorly executed and something quickly tossed into the movie.For me this movie didn't make me ponder or embrace a higher power. This is what we're supposed to think simply because he survived a ship wreck? God spared him? What about the people in the supposed second story (what really happened) who didn't survive like his mother and the cook and sailor? If the story were told from their point of view we'd have a very depressing movie pondering that there is no god at all. Instead we are fed a sugar-coated, extravagant lie and now we're supposed to feel all warm and fuzzy inside. So much detail paid to fantasy and the animation and not nearly enough to details and to conveying a consistent and infallible message.

At one level, it's an eminently watchable survival adventure and pure visual treat. I haven't read the book yet (I will now), but I have to asume it has a fable-like quality, and so does the film. The color alone is surreal and intense. The cinematography is gorgeous. Some of the shots... woah. There is some odd unreal nighttime lighting here too -- although it works. There is very heavy use of shallow depth of field to good effect.It's worth noting that I saw the film in 3D, which has clearly graduated from three years ago when it was only for the likes of Alice in Wonderland (hiss) and How to Train Your Dragon. Now we have it in high budget literary adventure religious allegory. Interestingly, I'm pretty convinced that 3D has the effect of decreasing realism. It makes everything look like CGI, heightened, super-real, like an HDR photograph.The acting is also superb. The casting of Pi at various ages is dead on. All three are highly emotive. And the tiger -- who is presumably 90% CGI -- he's the stuff of legend. There is one damn cool animal. The soggy cat hanging off the side of the boat is just so sad, lest us forget that the Bengal Tiger is the world's most dangerous land animal. Tiger's are fast, deadly, climb, swim, and can bat your head off with one paw. Imagine sharing a lifeboat with one! There's a 19th century tiger known to have killed over 430 men.The film is to beautiful, that the ocean itself, and its bevy of sea life, becomes a character. As desperate as Pi (and Richard Parker the Tiger) are, they can't help but marvel at the little seen wonders that present, and us with them.Thematically, I'm not yet sure how to digest Life of Pi. It's a pretty deeply emotional movie, and at some level plays to the film medium's visual strengths. The picture hints at deeper philosophical notes, but doesn't really illuminate. I sense extreme abbreviation. After all, 450 pages of novel would result in perhaps six hours of film.Andy Gavin, author of The Darkening Dream and Untimed",5,Amazing Adpation,1363824000,"03 21, 2013",2013,2458,"['Ang', 'Lee', 'pretty', 'damn', 'amazing', 'Here', 'Chinese', 'filmaker', 'ouvre', 'such', 'varied', 'work', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'Hulk', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'Eat', 'Drink', 'Man', 'Woman', 'Lust', 'Caution', 'now', 'Life', 'Pi', 'Hulk', 'pretty', 'brilliant', 'one', 'man', 'can', 'capture', 'unique', 'Chinese', 'flavor', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Western', 'American', 'rhythm', 'Brokeback', 'Amazing.Now', 'have', 'film', 'categorization', 'one', 'level', 'eminently', 'watchable', 'survival', 'adventure', 'pure', 'visual', 'treat', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'yet', 'will', 'now', 'have', 'asume', 'fable-like', 'quality', 'so', 'film', 'color', 'alone', 'surreal', 'intense', 'cinematography', 'gorgeous', 'shots', 'woah', 'odd', 'unreal', 'nighttime', 'lighting', 'here', 'too', 'very', 'heavy', 'use', 'shallow', 'depth', 'field', 'good', 'effect.It', 'worth', 'noting', 'saw', 'film', '3D', 'clearly', 'graduated', 'three', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'was', 'only', 'likes', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'hiss', 'Train', 'Dragon', 'Now', 'have', 'high', 'budget', 'literary', 'adventure', 'religious', 'allegory', 'Interestingly', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'convinced', '3D', 'effect', 'decreasing', 'realism', 'everything', 'look', 'CGI', 'heightened', 'super-real', 'HDR', 'photograph.The', 'acting', 'also', 'superb', 'casting', 'Pi', 'various', 'ages', 'dead', 'three', 'are', 'highly', 'emotive', 'tiger', 'who', 'presumably', '90', '%', 'CGI', 'stuff', 'legend', 'one', 'damn', 'cool', 'animal', 'soggy', 'cat', 'hanging', 'off', 'side', 'boat', 'just', 'so', 'sad', 'lest', 'forget', 'Bengal', 'Tiger', 'world', 'most', 'dangerous', 'land', 'animal', 'Tiger', 'are', 'fast', 'deadly', 'climb', 'swim', 'can', 'bat', 'head', 'one', 'paw', 'Imagine', 'sharing', 'lifeboat', 'one', '19th', 'century', 'tiger', 'known', 'have', 'killed', 'over', '430', 'men.The', 'film', 'beautiful', 'ocean', 'bevy', 'sea', 'life', 'character', 'As', 'desperate', 'Pi', 'Richard', 'Parker', 'Tiger', 'are', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'marvel', 'little', 'seen', 'wonders', 'present', 'them.Thematically', ""'m"", 'not', 'yet', 'sure', 'how', 'digest', 'Life', 'Pi', 'pretty', 'deeply', 'emotional', 'movie', 'level', 'plays', 'film', 'medium', 'visual', 'strengths', 'picture', 'hints', 'deeper', 'philosophical', 'notes', ""n't"", 'really', 'illuminate', 'sense', 'extreme', 'abbreviation', '450', 'pages', 'novel', 'would', 'result', 'perhaps', 'six', 'hours', 'film.Andy', 'Gavin', 'author', 'Darkening', 'Dream', 'Untimed']",N/A

The 3D aspects of Life of Pi are subtle and probably make little difference in terms of the the story.  But it certainly has its moments of depth that enhance the beautiful cinematography.  While the film is memorable for the many scenes on the open sea with just Pi and Richard Parker (the tiger), the shots looking upward through the water in the clear-as-a-bell swimming pool are the images I think of most often.  Life of Pi is based on a book that was among my favorites when it came out several years ago, so I was prepared to be disappointed in the film.  I wasn't.

1485751,A2JDYUSI2RILEB,B005LAIIHG,Andre Dursin,"[3, 4]","For its technical accomplishments alone, Ang Lee's LIFE OF PI is likely to rank at the top of the list of 2012's best for many viewers, and there's no doubt from an artistic standpoint, its visuals were unmatched by any other film last year.An adaptation of Yann Martel's seemingly impenetrable rumination on the triumph of the human spirit, man's place in the universe, and the role of religion in an individual's spiritual journey, ""Life of Pi"" is, first and foremost, a film for the senses. Working from a script by David Magee, director Lee's film follows ""Pi"" Patel (Suraj Sharma), a young man who learns of different religions growing up in the Puducherry region of what was once French India. His inquisitive nature, both encouraged by his mother (Tabu) and discouraged by a father (Adil Hussain) who operates a zoo in their town, is scuttled as he grows older and his family is eventually forced to immigrate to Canada. En route, the Japanese freighter carrying them, as well as their zoo animals, is wrecked in a storm, with only Pi escaping - alongside a zebra, orangutan, hyena, and a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker, who journeys with Pi on an ocean teeming with both peril and wonder, with florescent jellyfish lighting up the world beneath them and humpback whales catapulting through the air.""Life of Pi"" is so staggeringly, jaw-droppingly beautiful that Lee and cinematographer Claudia Miranda's effective use of the 3-D format is evident from the movie's first frames. Long before Pi and Richard Parker set out on a lifeboat of individual discovery, ""Life of Pi"" has already captivated the viewer with its fascinating portrait of young Pi's life in French India, with gorgeous landscapes, colors and animals filling each and every frame. Most of the movies we see using 3-D employ it merely as a gimmick to goose grosses, but much like Martin Scorsese's ""Hugo,"" Lee here frames so many sequences with depth-of-field dimension that its inclusion ranks as an absolute necessity to appreciating the spellbinding images that Lee and Miranda - both of whom were deservedly honored with Oscars, alongside composer Mychael Danna and the visual effects team at Rhythm & Hues - generated here.The film's story is another matter; one can easily see why readers of Martel's book were drawn to the material, for its mostly ambiguous, take-out-what-you-put-in take on world religion and faith, in general, functions mostly as a byproduct of the individual reader. On-screen, Lee is able to invest the material with a similar cloudiness, though that ambiguity is harder to achieve in a medium like film. There's no outright sermonizing in the picture, but its ending is more forcefully tilted in one direction than the more hazy conclusion Martel originally wrote. Still, however obvious (or not) the film's metaphorical messages and spiritual philosophizing happen to be, there's no question ""Life of Pi"" is a film that's impossible to forget and easy to appreciate on a sheer artistic level. Whether or not you find it to be as enriching an emotional journey will be - much like its source material - up to the individual viewer.Fox's 3-D Blu-Ray presentation of ""Life of Pi"" is unquestionably a must-view for any 3-D home theaterphile. The images, composition and clarity of the 3-D are spectacular throughout, and as I wrote before, few films have demanded viewing in the 3-D format more than ""Life of Pi."" The 3-D Blu-Ray also includes nearly 15 minutes of exclusive deleted scenes, plus the trailer in 3D and visual effects progressions (these exclusive extras can also be played in a standard BD player). Other supplements on the standard Blu (which features a dazzling 1080p AVC encoded transfer in its own right) boast several featurettes, an art gallery and storyboards, while a DVD and digital copy round out the disc. The DTS MA 7.1 audio is impressively mounted as well, highlighting another fine score written by Danna for his long-time cinematic collaborator.One final note on ""Life of Pi"": it's inconceivable to me that this picture generated a PG rating from the MPAA. With its marketing campaign dominated by images of Pi and the tiger together in the lifeboat, I have no doubt there were parents who took children to this film, only to be horrified by the animal violence that occurs in it - even if it's off-camera and isn't gratuitous, this isn't a film for young kids, and should've absolutely received a PG-13 for that and the generally intense tone of the picture. Of course, this isn't the first sign our ratings system is dysfunctional - merely the latest evidence of it.",4,"Gorgeous 3-D Visuals in a Unique, If Uneven, Viewing Experience",1365033600,"04 4, 2013",2013,4602,"['technical', 'accomplishments', 'alone', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'LIFE', 'OF', 'PI', 'likely', 'rank', 'top', 'list', '2012', 'best', 'many', 'viewers', 'doubt', 'artistic', 'standpoint', 'visuals', 'were', 'unmatched', 'other', 'film', 'last', 'year.An', 'adaptation', 'Yann', 'Martel', 'seemingly', 'impenetrable', 'rumination', 'triumph', 'human', 'spirit', 'man', 'place', 'universe', 'role', 'religion', 'individual', 'spiritual', 'journey', 'Life', 'Pi', 'first', 'foremost', 'film', 'senses', 'Working', 'script', 'David', 'Magee', 'director', 'Lee', 'film', 'Pi', 'Patel', 'Suraj', 'Sharma', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'different', 'religions', 'growing', 'up', 'Puducherry', 'region', 'what', 'was', 'once', 'French', 'India', 'inquisitive', 'nature', 'encouraged', 'mother', 'Tabu', 'discouraged', 'father', 'Adil', 'Hussain', 'who', 'zoo', 'town', 'scuttled', 'older', 'family', 'eventually', 'forced', 'immigrate', 'Canada', 'En', 'route', 'Japanese', 'freighter', 'carrying', 'as', 'well', 'zoo', 'animals', 'wrecked', 'storm', 'only', 'Pi', 'escaping', 'zebra', 'orangutan', 'hyena', 'Bengal', 'tiger', 'named', 'Richard', 'Parker', 'who', 'Pi', 'ocean', 'teeming', 'peril', 'wonder', 'florescent', 'jellyfish', 'lighting', 'up', 'world', 'humpback', 'whales', 'catapulting', 'air', 'Life', 'Pi', 'so', 'staggeringly', 'jaw-droppingly', 'beautiful', 'Lee', 'cinematographer', 'Claudia', 'Miranda', 'effective', 'use', '3-D', 'format', 'evident', 'movie', 'first', 'frames', 'Long', 'Pi', 'Richard', 'Parker', 'set', 'out', 'lifeboat', 'individual', 'discovery', 'Life', 'Pi', 'already', 'captivated', 'viewer', 'fascinating', 'portrait', 'young', 'Pi', 'life', 'French', 'India', 'gorgeous', 'landscapes', 'colors', 'animals', 'filling', 'frame', 'Most', 'movies', 'see', 'using', '3-D', 'employ', 'merely', 'gimmick', 'goose', 'grosses', 'much', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'Hugo', 'Lee', 'here', 'so', 'many', 'sequences', 'depth-of-field', 'dimension', 'inclusion', 'ranks', 'absolute', 'necessity', 'appreciating', 'spellbinding', 'Lee', 'Miranda', 'whom', 'were', 'deservedly', 'honored', 'Oscars', 'alongside', 'composer', 'Mychael', 'Danna', 'visual', 'effects', 'team', 'Rhythm', 'Hues', 'generated', 'here.The', 'film', 'story', 'matter', 'one', 'can', 'easily', 'see', 'why', 'readers', 'Martel', 'book', 'were', 'drawn', 'material', 'mostly', 'ambiguous', 'take-out-what-you-put-in', 'take', 'world', 'religion', 'faith', 'general', 'functions', 'mostly', 'byproduct', 'individual', 'reader', 'On-screen', 'Lee', 'able', 'invest', 'material', 'similar', 'cloudiness', 'ambiguity', 'harder', 'achieve', 'medium', 'film', 'outright', 'sermonizing', 'picture', 'ending', 'more', 'forcefully', 'tilted', 'one', 'direction', 'more', 'hazy', 'conclusion', 'Martel', 'originally', 'wrote', 'Still', 'however', 'obvious', 'not', 'film', 'metaphorical', 'messages', 'spiritual', 'philosophizing', 'happen', 'be', 'question', 'Life', 'Pi', 'film', 'impossible', 'forget', 'easy', 'appreciate', 'sheer', 'artistic', 'level', 'not', 'find', 'be', 'enriching', 'emotional', 'journey', 'will', 'be', 'much', 'source', 'material', 'up', 'individual', 'viewer.Fox', '3-D', 'Blu-Ray', 'presentation', 'Life', 'Pi', 'unquestionably', 'must-view', '3-D', 'home', 'theaterphile', 'images', 'composition', 'clarity', '3-D', 'are', 'spectacular', 'wrote', 'few', 'films', 'have', 'demanded', 'viewing', '3-D', 'format', 'more', 'Life', 'Pi', '3-D', 'Blu-Ray', 'also', 'nearly', '15', 'minutes', 'exclusive', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'trailer', '3D', 'visual', 'effects', 'progressions', 'exclusive', 'extras', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'played', 'standard', 'BD', 'player', 'Other', 'supplements', 'standard', 'Blu', 'dazzling', '1080p', 'AVC', 'encoded', 'transfer', 'own', 'right', 'boast', 'several', 'featurettes', 'art', 'gallery', 'storyboards', 'DVD', 'digital', 'copy', 'round', 'disc', 'DTS', 'MA', '7.1', 'audio', 'impressively', 'mounted', 'as', 'well', 'highlighting', 'fine', 'score', 'written', 'Danna', 'long-time', 'cinematic', 'collaborator.One', 'final', 'note', 'Life', 'Pi', 'inconceivable', 'picture', 'generated', 'PG', 'rating', 'MPAA', 'marketing', 'campaign', 'dominated', 'images', 'Pi', 'tiger', 'together', 'lifeboat', 'have', 'doubt', 'were', 'parents', 'who', 'took', 'children', 'film', 'only', 'be', 'horrified', 'animal', 'violence', 'even', 'off-camera', ""n't"", 'gratuitous', ""n't"", 'film', 'young', 'kids', 'should', ""'ve"", 'absolutely', 'received', 'PG-13', 'generally', 'intense', 'tone', 'picture', 'course', ""n't"", 'first', 'sign', 'ratings', 'system', 'dysfunctional', 'merely', 'latest', 'evidence']",N/A
1485752,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B005LAIIHG,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 5]","I've given myself a few months to digest this film, since I feel as though my initial response to it may have been jilted thanks to my unapologetic adoration of the novel.  Jilted in a bad way, since I felt this paled in comparison and so I was almost angry at the film for being critically successful.  Taking these few months to let it all marinade, I have to admit that not a whole lot has changed from my initial feelings.While reading `Life of Pi', on a plane coming home from Europe, I was spellbound.  Page after page kept me intrigued and absorbed and engaged and completely in awe of everything being expressed and expounded on.  The journey and magical quality of it all was one thing, but the spiritual undertones and the way it beautifully developed the themes of faith and God were so articulate yet never condescending or overbearing that it all felt so effortless.  Up until that point, I had no real interest in the film adaptation that was fast approaching, but after putting the book down I was overcome with this intense desire to see Lee's film.  When I saw that it was a PG rated film, obviously directed at families, I was a bit hesitant.  It's not that the novel was extremely graphic, and yet in parts it really was and I just couldn't understand how you could try and make this a family film.Still, I had to see it.For those unfamiliar with the story, the basic premise is this.  A young boy named Pi (pronounced Pee) grows up in India on a zoo with his family.  At a young age he becomes fascinated with the idea of God and faith and religion and begins to study and practice multiple religions in an attempt to bring himself closer to God.  When his family decides to sell the zoo and move to Canada, Pi finds himself on a boat with a crew that dislikes him and a slew of animals in cages awaiting their destiny overseas.  During a terrible and unexpected storm everything goes awry, Pi's family is killed and he is left destitute on a life boat with a hyena, zebra, orangutan and Richard Parker, a Bengal tiger.  For 227 days, Pi has to learn to survive alongside this beast.It is an intriguing tale and one that it mostly approached from an angle of respect, and I must admit that the way Lee visually crafts the film is marvelous, but outside of those visuals I found the film to be almost shallow in its presentation of the more intimate and important themes of the story.  The core of the story is lost in a film that becomes redundant and superficial.  I think a big problem with the `translation' of the film is that the key segments on the book are all internalized.  You read the thought patterns of young Pi and you begin to become entranced in his world.  In film it isn't always easy to convey internalized transformations and so the outward redundancies (yelling at the tiger, starving, fishing, yelling at the tiger) carry less weight.  While there is tragedy at the center of the film, it became almost too focused on the visuals and so it lost the heaviness needed to carry the emotional side of the story.  It became pretty, but empty.  I also found the changes to the story to be unnecessary.  Pi's love interest was a ridiculous inclusion, especially since there is no development of that story and so their separation carries no weight.  I also found the whale scene to be kind of pointless, yet pretty, and while I understand the idea of creating tension thanks to the aftermath of the scene it just didn't do what it set out to do.The way the film is spliced is also somewhat irritating, although I'm sure it was developed to try and add some interruption to the redundancy of Pi's struggle.  The constant shifting from present to past and the use of Irrfan Khan (elder Pi) as a narrator for many of Pi's actions felt forced and took me out of the story, to be honest.  It also took some of the key moments in the book (like the adventure on Meerkat Island) and condensed them to the point where they were almost pointless.  I understand the need of narration to explain certain things that visuals won't readily explain, but these segments were so short that they almost trivialized their inclusion.I'll admit, the conclusion is still heartbreaking, and when the big question is asked, ""Which story do you prefer?"", I can't help but feel the lump in my throat.  I also can't help  but reply, ""I prefer the story Yann Martel told me!"".Still, `Life of Pi' is a beautiful film.  The visual effects are some of the best I've ever seen in a film, and for that it richly deserved its Oscar.  I take issue with the cinematography Oscar, since the skies and sea were all created by the visual effects department, but whatever.  This was purely a director's film in the end, and so for that I guess Lee's Oscar shouldn't be all that shocking to me, although I really don't think he deserved it.  He may have created a visually arresting film, but the core of this film was not a visual one but an emotional and spiritual one and he failed to tie those ends together (for me).Despite the heaviness of the actual prose, there is something `slight' about this interpretation.",3,A tad lost in translation...,1363219200,"03 14, 2013",2013,5113,"[""'ve"", 'given', 'few', 'months', 'digest', 'film',

Life of Pi almost equals The Hobbit in vivid, lush, gorgeous cinematography. Everything looks and feels magical! The CGI does nothing but accentuate the film. It accents the story and the human actors, without detracting of distracting from the film (Lucas...Cameron...I'm looking at you!)Yes, the story is hugely dumbed down for the film. This is my only con. Lee cuts out at least 45% of the book, including several storm sequences, a fight between Richard Parker and a Mako shark, another castaway that Pi happens upon, numerous brilliant philosophical musings, and quite a bit off the ending.If I had to choose between them, I would say I liked the book better. But it's impressive that Lee came as far as he did. I would NEVER have thought it possible to film Life of Pi, never!But that is not to detract from the visual magic, the beautiful cinematography, the ground-breaking CGI, the stellar acting (Suraj Sharma, kudos to you. You have a career ahead of you!). I loved Life of Pi. I saw it twice, and turned around the second time to watch the audiences faces during the infamous ""jump scare"".Strongest Recommendation for Life of Pi! 4.5 Stars!P.S.

Not sure if I ever will, but there it is, I haven't. And thankfully it's not one of those ""you HAVE to read the book to understand the movie"" type of things. I thought the film started off slow, but it helped establish Pi's character rather than just toss him on a lifeboat with a tiger and wait to see what character development happens afterward. The reason for going by ""Pi"" was creative. And the telling of the story via flashbacks was a good choice; you got the sense that even so many years later, Pi still carries all of this with him every single day. The actors appeared very well cast in their roles -- I liked that Lee cast a lot of unknowns (or at least, unfamiliar to the Western world), because then you weren't distracted by preconceived notions of the actors' abilities and you could focus on the story the film was telling. Suraj Sharma did a particularly spectacular job, considering how his tiger companion was a character completely created in CGI. From a technical standpoint, Life of Pi deserved every Oscar it scored (Visual Effects, Director, Score, Cinematography). The score was subtle but stirring when it needed to be, and seemed to evoke more emotionally than the actors could, probably due to Pi's somewhat stagnant position on the lifeboat in the middle of the ocean. The night scene stands out to me as far as effects, score and cinematography are concerned because it just takes your breath away; between the infinite number of stars and the bright reflections of fish underwater to the breaching humpback, the entire scene was incredible to watch. And enough praise cannot be bestowed on the crew who worked to bring not just Richard Parker but all the other animals to life as well -- they all acted very realistically in regard to each other and to Pi himself. I have friends who've seen this film and thought it extremely boring -- maybe it's jsut me, but I can't understand how something so intriguing could bore someone.

Due to a mishap Pi no longer has to speculate but actually lives ""life the universe and everything.""

1485806,A2NI9BFPKAFAZ0,B005LAIIHG,Blago Jones,"[3, 11]","Why you shouldn't see it:Not to give away too much about this particular movie, but... it drags at parts. While it doesn't necessarily feel any longer than its two hour runtime, it does feel every minute of it. Have you ever watched a movie that takes place entirely on a lifeboat? Well, neither have I, but I've now seen half of a movie that takes place entirely on a lifeboat. I understand there's another movie - titled, coincidentally enough, Lifeboat - that takes place entirely on a lifeboat. Maybe someday I'll watch that Hitchcock piece, but until then I'll have to settle for this particular lifeboat-centric movie. Okay, okay, I have exaggerated slightly how much of this movie takes place on a lifeboat. The parts of the movie that take place on the lifeboat aren't technically entirely on the lifeboat, as there is also the 20-or-so-foot radius of open water around the lifeboat where some action also takes place. So there's that.This one actually reminds me a fair amount of Cast Away in that the majority of the movie leans heavily on the ability of a single character to engage the audience's interest while he does nothing more than try to survive in extraordinary circumstances. The problem with that comparison is that Suraj Sharma is no Tom Hanks (full disclosure: I have an almost creepy respect for Tom Hanks' acting chops, so I may be biased here). While the latter half of Cast Away thrives on Hanks' ability to make otherwise mundane onscreen moments incredibly intriguing, Life of Pi just doesn't have as strong a feature actor to revolve its survival story around.Strangely, some of the more dragging parts of the movie happen before Pi ever fatefully sets foot on a boat. Since the story isn't so much about a lifeboat as it is about a boy and the man that boy becomes, there's the sometimes regrettable necessity of building a backstory about where this person is coming from. It's hard to explain, but there is just something about this backstory that doesn't hold my attention nearly as well as others (for example, Cast Away). As a general rule, I spent a fair amount of the first half of the movie wondering things like, ""When are they getting on the boat?"", ""Why are they not on the boat yet?"", ""Why do Indians wiggle their heads like that when they talk? Do they think it conveys any message to the listener other than induced confusion?"", and, ""Wait, does this movie even have a boat in it?""Why you should see it:Perhaps above I didn't mention a fairly big (literally and figuratively) additional character in the movie, specifically in the lifeboat: an adult male Bengal tiger. The tiger has a name, but I won't spoil that for you, and I will just refer to it here as ""tiger."" So anyway, what you thought was going to be a nice, laid back, somewhat boring adventure on a lifeboat turns out to be, in fact, a second-by-second struggle for survival against a freaking Bengal tiger. In case you're not as familiar as I am with Bengal tigers, just know that they average 500 pounds and are considered to be the most aggressive subspecies of an animal that is known to occasionally eat people.Tiger has a funny name in the movie, and I will give credit to the author and screenwriter for occasionally adding in appropriate moments of humor and everyday humanity into an extraordinary coming of age story. If it hadn't been for the occasional giggle moments in the first half of the movie, I'm not sure I would have made it to the second half. Well, that's an exaggeration, since I'm pretty thoroughly stubborn when it comes to finishing movies, and even more so when it comes to best picture nominees. Still, suffice it to say that there wasn't much to hold my attention for the first hour.All that being said, there is really one main reason that anyone would want to see Life of Pi, and that reason has everything to do with an appreciation for visual art. Once the film reaches the boat, nearly every frame of the movie one could take, frame, and put it up on his or her wall. The visuals are stimulating not only due to the fact that they include crystal clear detail and vivid, saturated colors, but they also depict images that are not frequently seen. You may not be aware, but an adult male Bengal tiger does not often chill out on a lifeboat playing with flying fish in the middle of the ocean. Even in little moments, Lee finds ways to create visual art out of his material. When the opening credits are rolling over footage of a small Indian zoo, the words on the screen behave like the animals on the screen. Sometimes it's the little things.In Short:Life of Pi is visually breathtaking at moments and beautiful for the rest of it. If you have interest in seeing it and aren't opposed to the whole 3D phenomenon, I recommend it as a readily available way to suck you even further into the visuals Lee has created. The story drags at parts for me, and but for the payoff at the end (which I won't spoil for you), I would be happy to write the whole thing off as eye candy and nothing more. But that payoff is there, and as a consequence I've been thinking about it since I saw it almost a week ago. If it weren't for the occasional slowness of the movie itself, I would rate it higher, but for now I'll settle at a 7 out of 10 and recommend it to anyone who likes pretty things and/or exploring the nature of storytelling.Exceptions to the recommendation:- anyone who would prefer to believe that there is no beauty in the world;- people who are frightened by adult male Bengal tigers (just kidding, because that should really be anyone/everyone, and I'm not going to recommend that no one see this movie just because of a healthy respect for one's own mortality when near that particular ornery feline);- militant atheists... I guess I should have mentioned somewhere that this story is set up as proof that God exists and has a fair amount to do with religion... oops;- racists (who aren't Indian);- homophobes who want to stick it to Ang Lee (figuratively) for daring to make a movie about gays (this movie doesn't have any gays to my knowledge, but I figure sticking it to Lee for Brokeback Mountain by not watching Life of Pi makes about as much sense as homophobia in general);- people who don't like irrational numbers.",3,Worthwhile Theme Wrapped Up In Gorgeous Visuals,1362873600,"03 10, 2013",2013,6269,"['Why',

I couldn't even think of one thing that would make it remotely interesting, but this movie surprised me. The beginning won me over with its witty moments. For instance, Pi discovered Islam and then practiced it. Then, I imagine it wasn't a day later he was asking to be baptized in the traditional Christian manner. Pi's mother could only smile. His father thought it was foolish. The story continues and eventually, he discovers Richard, the Bengal tiger, and he is taught a lesson about what the animal really is. I don't think he learned anything from that lesson, and I don't think he ever does. The story kept moving and eventually went to the ship sinking and how Pi came to survive with the tiger.I will admit I was surprised and at awe at this movie. It was thoughtfully written and beautifully presented. I was most interested in the floating carnivorous island, and all the meerkats. That part was so cool, and I was just smiling while watching that part of it. Everyone involved in the creation of this movie did a great job. The hard work and creativity involved did not escape me, and I am glad I took the time to watch it.

Well, 2D already has depth, otherwise it would be unwatchable. As far as I'm concerned if things aren't popping out of the screen then 3D is absolutely pointless. The pop-out is, after all, the 3rd dimension.There was virtually no 3D in this film as far as I could tell. Just look at the cover image. How great would it have been to have that giant whale pop out of the screen and into your living room? How about water rushing toward you? Or your living room seemingly engulfed in waves with mist all around? That's what I was expecting when I purchased this film. But none of that was to be found.

A cynic might interpret this as a touchy-feely globalist literary prop to make the movie more likeable to a broad global audience whose members are actually locked in post-enlightenment zeitgeist of religious war and tension.  That same cynic might also add that the true god of Corporate Globalism is a one-out-of-three unholy trinity of Migrants, Mammon, & Moloch.The political situation shifts in India and Pi and his family sell the zoo and transport the animals on a Japanese freighter for Canada.  On the ship they meet a rude French cook, a kind-hearted Japanese sailor and look after their animals.  One night there is a terrible storm and the freighter sinks, Pi is the only human survivor.  On the lifeboat, which is half covered by canvas, is an injured zebra, an female orangutan who has lost her baby to the sea, and a vicious hyena.  As the shipwrecked zoo progress on their journey, the hyena kills the zebra, than the orangutan, and then suddenly , Richard Parker, the Bengal Tiger leaps from under the canvas, killing the hyena.  Pi is then alone, with a vicious tiger.  Pi must tame the great cat and use his wits to help them both survive.In an epic of surreal filmography Pi and Richard Parker drift across the Pacific, during one storm Pi sees Almighty Providence, when he tries to show the sight to Richard Parker, the tiger is seized with fear and must duck under the canvas.  In a delirium, Pi and Richard Parker wash up on a strange island-a garden of plenty by day but death by night.  Eventually, Pi washes up on a beach in tropical Mexico, and the tiger returns to the to jungle without looking back. Pi is then rescued by natives.At this point, the viewer is left with an unsettled feeling.  Pi's more important journey with God is soul-less, globalist nonsense, his reconciliation is nowhere near as believable as Lieutenant Dan's Jacob-like wrestling with God while tied to the mast of a shrimp boat during Hurricane Camille.However cynicism drops away and the entire meaning of the movie changes in retrospect with a subtle plot twist. Pi speaks to some Japanese officials in a Mexican hospital.  They are investigating the shipwreck as part of an insurance claim.  They don't believe his story.  He tells a different story-one of a dying, kind-hearted sailor, a resourceful and Darwinian French cook, and his scared mother in a lifeboat.  This story is darker, more emotionally taxing, and involves murder and cannibalism.  Without letting on which story is true, Pi mentions that the tiger Richard Parker was much like his Id, his will to survive, his inner-evil.  During the storm, when Pi sees The Almighty, Richard Parker can only tremble in terror.  This, second story takes the movie to a higher level.  It is a story that sticks in the mind, causing one to think backwards about the nuanced, subtle details in the story.  A viewer then picks at the suddenly real, suddenly rich, and suddenly colorful spiritual symbolism.I wish I could give it six stars.",5,The Life of Pi is an incredible story of man vs. nature with a mind-bending plot twist at the end,1369612800,"05 27, 2013",2013,3317,"['Pi', 'precocious', 'Indian', 'boy', 'Pondicherry', 'India', 'family', 'zoo', 'zoo', 'Bengal', 'Tiger', 'named', 'Richard', 'Parker', 'Pi', 'also', 'spiritual', 'child', 'rebelling', 'rationalist', 'New', 'India', 'father', 'spiritual', 'journey', 'Pi', 'Christianity', 'Islam', 'Hinduism', 'effort', 'find', 'love', 'God', 'A', 'cynic', 'might', 'interpret', 'touchy-feely', 'globalist', 'literary', 'prop', 'make', 'movie', 'more', 'likeable', 'broad', 'global', 'audience', 'members', 'are', 'actually', 'locked', 'post-enlightenment', 'zeitgeist', 'religious', 'war', 'tension', 'same', 'cynic', 'might', 'also', 'add', 'true', 'god', 'Corporate', 'Globalism', 'one-out-of-three', 'unholy', 'trinity', 'Migrants', 'Mammon', 'Moloch.The', 'political', 'situation', 'shifts', 'India', 'Pi', 'family', 'sell', 'zoo', 'transport', 'animals', 'Japanese', 'freighter', 'Canada', 'ship', 'meet', 'rude', 'French', 'cook', 'kind-hearted', 'Japanese', 'sailor', 'look', 'animals', 'One', 'night', 'terrible', 'storm', 'freighter', 'sinks', 'Pi', 'only', 'human', 'survivor', 'lifeboat', 'half', 'covered', 'canvas', 'injured', 'zebra', 'female', 'orangutan', 'who', 'lost', 'baby', 'sea', 'vicious', 'hyena', 'shipwrecked', 'zoo', 'progress', 'journey', 'hyena', 'zebra', 'orangutan', 'then', 'suddenly', 'Richard', 'Parker', 'Bengal', 'Tiger', 'canvas', 'killing', 'hyena', 'Pi', 'then', 'alone', 'vicious', 'tiger', 'Pi', 'must', 'tame', 'great', 'cat', 'use', 'wits', 'help', 'survive.In', 'epic', 'surreal', 'filmography', 'Pi', 'Richard', 'Parker', 'drift', 'Pacific', 'one', 'storm', 'Pi', 'Almighty', 'Providence', 'when', 'show', 'sight', 'Richard', 'Parker', 'tiger', 'seized', 'fear', 'must', 'duck', 'canvas', 'delirium', 'Pi', 'Richard', 'Parker', 'up', 'strange', 'island-a', 'garden', 'plenty', 'day', 'death', 'night', 'Eventually', 'Pi', 'up', 'beach', 'tropical', 'Mexico', 'tiger', 'jungle', 'looking', 'back', 'Pi', 'then', 'rescued', 'natives.At', 'point', 'viewer', 'left', 'unsettled', 'feeling', 'Pi', 'more', 'important', 'journey', 'God', 'soul-less', 'globalist', 'nonsense', 'reconciliation', 'nowhere', 'near', 'as', 'believable', 'Lieutenant', 'Dan', 'Jacob-like', 'wrestling', 'God', 'tied', 'mast', 'shrimp', 'boat', 'Hurricane', 'Camille.However', 'cynicism', 'away', 'entire', 'meaning', 'movie', 'changes', 'retrospect', 'subtle', 'plot', 'twist', 'Pi', 'Japanese', 'officials', 'Mexican', 'hospital', 'are', 'investigating', 'shipwreck', 'part', 'insurance', 'claim', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'story', 'different', 'story-one', 'dying', 'kind-hearted', 'sailor', 'resourceful', 'Darwinian', 'French', 'cook', 'scared', 'mother', 'lifeboat', 'story', 'darker', 'more', 'emotionally', 'taxing', 'murder', 'cannibalism', 'letting', 'story', 'true', 'Pi', 'mentions', 'tiger', 'Richard', 'Parker', 'was', 'much', 'Id', 'will', 'survive', 'inner-evil', 'storm', 'when', 'Pi', 'Almighty', 'Richard', 'Parker', 'can', 'only', 'tremble', 'terror', 'second', 'story', 'movie', 'higher', 'level', 'story', 'mind', 'causing', 'one', 'think', 'backwards', 'nuanced', 'subtle', 'details', 'story', 'viewer', 'then', 'suddenly', 'real', 'suddenly', 'rich', 'suddenly', 'colorful', 'spiritual', 'symbolism.I', 'wish', 'could', 'give', 'six', 'stars']",N/A

The movie has been in the works since 2003, but the nature of the film has caused many to think that it would never be possible. See, most of the film involves a boy in a lifeboat with an adult Bengal Tiger. The movie also involves many other challenging things to portray, including a massive shipwreck, an island of meerkats and a strong religious overtone that manages to be fair to all religions. Suraj Sharma plays Pi Patel, a boy becoming a man who challenges all conventional thinking as he leads his life. Curious about religion and religions, he prides himself in knowing not just one god, but all gods. Not to mention, despite its obvious carnivorous nature, he has faith that a Bengal Tiger named Richard Parker has a soul and can be befriended.""Life of Pi"" has many levels and as visually stimulating as it is, it is also mentally stimulating and beautiful in its intent. I'm not completely sure it achieved all that it intended but the gist of its message comes across loud and clear. Life is a gift and the days ahead are not guaranteed. Faith is vital in living a rewarding life and in knowing how life is not only to be lived, but to be cherished for each and every moment. I'm pretty sure that was the gist.Above all, ""Life of Pi"" is not just a well-filmed movie, but a gloriously well filmed film. The quality levels of the filming are unprecedented and its 3D makes all 3D that has been done prior look like the second and third-rate stuff that it is. The effects used to bring the tiger Richard Parker to life are awe-inspiring. Your eyes widen, as they should, when Parker strikes and when he nears. There has certainly never before been a movie that gives you the impression of what it would be like to be and live in the proximity of such a beast.""Life of Pi"" comes off a little heavy-handed at time and I have to admit that I assumed there would be more to it, but the amount there is to it is in the eye of the beholder. You can look at the movie and say that it wasn't about much, or you can look at the movie and say that it was about everything, because it is. The performances are outstanding, including the Tiger, and the film is without question, one of the best of 2012.",4,BEAUTIFULLY FILMED a little heavy handed,1357171200,"01 3, 2013",2013,2312,"['2001', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Yann', 'Martel', 'basis', 'Life', 'Pi', 'been', 'called', 'unfilmable', 'movie', 'been', 'works', '2003', 'nature', 'film', 'caused', 'many', 'think', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'possible', 'See', 'most', 'film', 'boy', 'lifeboat', 'adult', 'Bengal', 'Tiger', 'movie', 'also', 'many', 'other', 'challenging', 'things', 'portray', 'including', 'massive', 'shipwreck', 'island', 'meerkats', 'strong', 'religious', 'overtone', 'be', 'fair', 'religions', 'Suraj', 'Sharma', 'Pi', 'Patel', 'boy', 'becoming', 'man', 'who', 'conventional', 'thinking', 'life', 'Curious', 'religion', 'religions', 'knowing', 'not', 'just', 'one', 'god', 'gods', 'Not', 'mention', 'obvious', 'carnivorous', 'nature', 'faith', 'Bengal', 'Tiger', 'named', 'Richard', 'Parker', 'soul', 'can', 'be', 'befriended', 'Life', 'Pi', 'many', 'levels', 'visually', 'stimulating', 'also', 'mentally', 'stimulating', 'beautiful', 'intent', ""'m"", 'not', 'completely', 'sure', 'achieved', 'intended', 'gist', 'message', 'loud', 'clear', 'Life', 'gift', 'days', 'ahead', 'are', 'not', 'guaranteed', 'Faith', 'vital', 'living', 'rewarding', 'life', 'knowing', 'how', 'life', 'not', 'only', 'be', 'lived', 'be', 'cherished', 'moment', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'was', 'gist.Above', 'Life', 'Pi', 'not', 'just', 'well-filmed', 'movie', 'gloriously', 'well', 'filmed', 'film', 'quality', 'levels', 'filming', 'are', 'unprecedented', '3D', '3D', 'been', 'done', 'prior', 'look', 'second', 'third-rate', 'stuff', 'effects', 'used', 'bring', 'tiger', 'Richard', 'Parker', 'life', 'are', 'awe-inspiring', 'eyes', 'widen', 'should', 'when', 'Parker', 'strikes', 'when', 'certainly', 'never', 'before', 'been', 'movie', 'impression', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'be', 'live', 'proximity', 'such', 'beast', 'Life', 'Pi', 'off', 'little', 'heavy-handed', 'time', 'have', 'admit', 'assumed', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'amount', 'eye', 'beholder', 'can', 'look', 'movie', 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'about', 'much', 'can', 'look', 'movie', 'say', 'was', 'everything', 'performances', 'are', 'outstanding', 'including', 'Tiger', 'film', 'question', 'one', 'best', '2012']",N/A

It looks good in 3D and is well acted. Suraj Sharma and Irrfan Khan deserve a special mention as the young and adult Pi. Gerard Depardieu plays a small but significant role. Adil Hussain and Tabu are excellent as Pi's parents. The screenplay is fairly true to the book, but there is a romance element that has obviously been added, Hollywood style, and is completely unnecessary. There is a scene in the ship's dining room which, while not in the book, obviously serves as a device to give background for the alternative story by introducing the sailor who breaks his leg, and the cook. I was sorry the scene with the priest, the imam and the pandit was omitted. While the CGI and 3D effects were brilliant, I felt the storm/sinking ship scenes asked the viewer to suspend disbelief a little too much: how did Pi manage to get back to the lifeboat from so far away in the high seas?

Filmed in vibrant color and mostly natural settings, with animals featured in many scenes, it is more visually stunning than any nature documentary I've ever seen.  The scenes at sea, both at night under the stars and during the day, under a wide variety of different ocean conditions, show the true beauty and terrifying power of the open ocean.  Certainly some of the scenes, especially the phosphoresence scenes, are computer enhanced, but the net effect is spectacular.The animals, especially the Bengal tiger, are the costars of the movie, and their actions are incredibly lifelike and true to their animal nature.  This is no Disney film - in only one short scene does the tiger exhibit any humanlike traits.  I have no idea how Ang Lee actually created and captured these animal scenes on film - the special effects are so good, with no hints of fakery, that you will believe that all the scenes really were filmed at sea with the lead actor on a small boat alongside a hungry, vicious tiger.  This is present-day special effects at its absolute best, and in service to a movie that is not a science fiction shoot-em-up.  Impressive.The movie's story is about stories: how they are created and retold, and the impact they have on people.  ""Life of Pi"" has some interesting things to say about religion, because the documents at the heart of all major religions are effectively books of stories, very little of which can actually be proven or verified to have happened.  Pi's story about what happened at sea on his boat where he was the only human survivor is no different, and when you can't scientifically verify something, the question becomes what do you believe?  ""Life of Pi"" leaves it to the viewer to decide.""Life of Pi"" is quite an achievement for director Ang Lee.  I think I know why Hollywood voted the ""Hollywood saves the day"" film Argo as the Oscar's Best Picture of 2012, but ""Life of Pi"" is a far better and much more memorable movie.",5,Simply beautiful,1364342400,"03 27, 2013",2013,2173,"['Ang', 'Lee', 'Life', 'Pi', 'masterpiece', 'state-of-the-art', 'film', 'making', 'beautiful', 'creation', 'moving', 'story', 'heart-touching', 'way.Starting', 'very', 'opening', 'credits', 'gorgeous', 'film', 'watch', 'Filmed', 'vibrant', 'color', 'mostly', 'natural', 'settings', 'animals', 'featured', 'many', 'scenes', 'more', 'visually', 'stunning', 'nature', 'documentary', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'scenes', 'sea', 'night', 'stars', 'day', 'wide', 'variety', 'different', 'ocean', 'conditions', 'show', 'true', 'beauty', 'terrifying', 'power', 'open', 'ocean', 'Certainly', 'scenes', 'especially', 'phosphoresence', 'scenes', 'are', 'computer', 'enhanced', 'net', 'effect', 'spectacular.The', 'animals', 'especially', 'Bengal', 'tiger', 'are', 'costars', 'movie', 'actions', 'are', 'incredibly', 'lifelike', 'true', 'animal', 'nature', 'Disney', 'film', 'only', 'one', 'short', 'scene', 'tiger', 'exhibit', 'humanlike', 'traits', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'actually', 'created', 'captured', 'animal', 'scenes', 'film', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'hints', 'fakery', 'will', 'believe', 'scenes', 'really', 'were', 'filmed', 'sea', 'lead', 'actor', 'small', 'boat', 'hungry', 'vicious', 'tiger', 'present-day', 'special', 'effects', 'absolute', 'best', 'service', 'movie', 'not', 'science', 'fiction', 'shoot-em-up', 'Impressive.The', 'movie', 'story', 'stories', 'how', 'are', 'created', 'retold', 'impact', 'have', 'people', 'Life', 'Pi', 'interesting', 'things', 'say', 'religion', 'documents', 'heart', 'major', 'religions', 'are', 'effectively', 'books', 'stories', 'very', 'little', 'can', 'actually', 'be', 'proven', 'verified', 'have', 'happened', 'Pi', 'story', 'what', 'happened', 'sea', 'boat', 'where', 'was', 'only', 'human', 'survivor', 'different', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'scientifically', 'verify', 'something', 'question', 'what', 'do', 'believe', 'Life', 'Pi', 'viewer', 'decide', 'Life', 'Pi', 'quite', 'achievement', 'director', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'think', 'know', 'why', 'Hollywood', 'voted', 'Hollywood', 'day', 'film', 'Argo', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Picture', '2012', 'Life', 'Pi', 'far', 'better', 'much', 'more', 'memorable', 'movie']",N/A
1485916,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B005LAIIHG,C. Sawin,"[26, 37]","Ang Lee is a director that most individuals don't seem to be too fond of. To this day, his ""Hulk"" film remains unwatched because so many people have offered their opinion that it's awful. ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is in the same category, but for different reasons. Wuxia films are almost always better when the wire work is more subtle and ""Crouching Tiger"" looks to take no shame in everyone flying around at all times. ""Brokeback Mountain"" was the only Lee film to be experienced before ""Life of Pi"" and that was solely because seeking out Heath Ledger's work seemed like a pretty vital thing to do after ""The Dark Knight."" Going into ""Life of Pi,"" there was literally no interest. The book hadn't been read beforehand and trailers had not been seen. Expectations were mostly, ""It may be gorgeous to look at, but will lack any sort of depth."" One of the best feelings in the world is having your misconceptions about something be completely wrong and work out in ways you never imagined.""Life of Pi"" is narrated by an older Pi (Irrfan Khan) and takes place in the present as he tells his life story to a writer (Rafe Spall). Pi begins with how he got his name and how his family owned a zoo, but eventually leads into his family needing to leave India for financial purposes. The heart of the story lies in Pi as a young man (played by Suraj Sharma) and the time he spent out at sea on a lifeboat with a tiger named Richard Parker, but getting to that point is quite an ordeal. Pi loses everything and everyone close to him in the blink of an eye and he doesn't count on making what feels like an unbreakable bond with a Bengal tiger.The story is first introduced to the writer by a friend of the family called Mamaji and tells the writer that Pi's story will ""make him believe in God."" Mamaji is a champion swimmer and there's at least one really spectacular sequence at the beginning of the film where you see Mamaji swimming. The film is shot beautifully and makes full use of eye catching perspectives including overhead shots of the ocean. Pi begins on the lifeboat with a zebra, a hyena, and an orangutan, but the animals are an intricate part of the story. It's not entirely seamless as you can tell when real animals are being used and when CG enters the picture, but the transition from one to the other is relatively flawless.The adventure film offers a rather marvelous message about religion as Pi discusses the experimentation with several different religions as a young boy. Even though it seems kind of silly that a boy has adopted so many religions at one point in his life, it portrays a religious message in a light that doesn't seem too preachy which is very welcome and unusual for a message of this caliber. But the religious aspect is really only a backdrop for being on your own path to finding who you really are. Feeling so alone for so long and having Pi talk about not being alone and not getting to say goodbye to those he cared about most is one of those things that just hits you really hard.While witnessing Pi attempt to tame Richard Parker is really entertaining, there are so many unbelievable sights to witness in ""Life of Pi."" There's the whale, the jellyfish, the flying fish, that disastrous storm, and that seaweed island with all of the meerkats. ""Life of Pi"" never really lets up on being visually astounding from beginning to end. A personal favorite is when Pi starts seeing visions in the ocean and what he questions as being a daydream or a night dream.""Life of Pi"" is pleasantly satisfying. With a heartfelt message, beautiful visuals, and stunning camera work, ""Life of Pi"" is truly a sight to behold and illustrates how essential 3D can be to a film that isn't a summer blockbuster.",5,A dazzling voyage of self discovery,1353542400,"11 22, 2012",2012,3740,"['Ang', 'Lee', 'director', 'most', 'individuals', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'too', 'fond', 'day', 'Hulk', 'film', 'unwatched', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'offered', 'opinion', 'awful', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'same', 'category', 'different', 'reasons', 'Wuxia', 'films', 'are', 'almost', 'always', 'better', 'when', 'wire', 'work', 'more', 'subtle', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'take', 'shame', 'everyone', 'flying', 'around', 'times', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'was', 'only', 'Lee', 'film', 'be', 'experienced', 'Life', 'Pi', 'was', 'solely', 'seeking', 'out', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'work', 'seemed', 'pretty', 'vital', 'thing', 'do', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Going', 'Life', 'Pi', 'was', 'literally', 'interest', 'book', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'read', 'beforehand', 'trailers', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'seen', 'Expectations', 'were', 'mostly', 'may', 'be', 'gorgeous', 'look', 'will', 'lack', 'sort', 'depth', 'One', 'best', 'feelings', 'world', 'having', 'misconceptions', 'something', 'be', 'completely', 'wrong', 'work', 'out', 'ways', 'never', 'imagined', 'Life', 'Pi', 'narrated', 'older', 'Pi', 'Irrfan', 'Khan', 'place', 'present', 'life', 'story', 'writer', 'Rafe', 'Spall', 'Pi', 'how', 'got', 'name', 'how', 'family', 'owned', 'zoo', 'eventually', 'family', 'needing', 'leave', 'India', 'financial', 'purposes', 'heart', 'story', 'Pi', 'young', 'man', 'played', 'Suraj', 'Sharma', 'time', 'spent', 'out', 'sea', 'lifeboat', 'tiger', 'named', 'Richard', 'Parker', 'getting', 'point', 'quite', 'ordeal', 'Pi', 'everything', 'everyone', 'close', 'blink', 'eye', ""n't"", 'count', 'making', 'what', 'feels', 'unbreakable', 'bond', 'Bengal', 'tiger.The', 'story', 'first', 'introduced', 'writer', 'friend', 'family', 'called', 'Mamaji', 'writer', 'Pi', 'story', 'will', 'make', 'believe', 'God', 'Mamaji', 'champion', 'swimmer', 'least', 'one', 'really', 'spectacular', 'sequence', 'beginning', 'film', 'where', 'see', 'Mamaji', 'swimming', 'film', 'shot', 'beautifully', 'full', 'use', 'eye', 'catching', 'perspectives', 'including', 'overhead', 'shots', 'ocean', 'Pi', 'lifeboat', 'zebra', 'hyena', 'orangutan', 'animals', 'are', 'intricate', 'part', 'story', 'not', 'entirely', 'seamless', 'can', 'tell', 'when', 'real', 'animals', 'are', 'being', 'used', 'when', 'CG', 'picture', 'transition', 'one', 'other', 'relatively', 'flawless.The', 'adventure', 'film', 'rather', 'marvelous', 'message', 'about', 'religion', 'Pi', 'experimentation', 'several', 'different', 'religions', 'young', 'boy', 'Even', 'kind', 'silly', 'boy', 'adopted', 'so', 'many', 'religions', 'one', 'point', 'life', 'religious', 'message', 'light', ""n't"", 'seem', 'too', 'preachy', 'very', 'welcome', 'unusual', 'message', 'caliber', 'religious', 'aspect', 'really', 'only', 'backdrop', 'being', 'own', 'path', 'finding', 'who', 'really', 'are', 'Feeling', 'so', 'alone', 'so', 'long', 'having', 'Pi', 'talk', 'not', 'being', 'alone', 'not', 'getting', 'say', 'goodbye', 'cared', 'most', 'one', 'things', 'just', 'really', 'hard.While', 'witnessing', 'Pi', 'attempt', 'tame', 'Richard', 'Parker', 'really', 'entertaining', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'unbelievable', 'sights', 'witness', 'Life', 'Pi', 'whale', 'jellyfish', 'flying', 'fish', 'disastrous', 'storm', 'seaweed', 'island', 'meerkats', 'Life', 'Pi', 'never', 'really', 'up', 'being', 'visually', 'astounding', 'beginning', 'end', 'personal', 'favorite', 'when', 'Pi', 'seeing', 'visions', 'ocean', 'what', 'questions', 'being', 'daydream', 'night', 'dream', 'Life', 'Pi', 'pleasantly', 'satisfying', 'heartfelt', 'message', 'beautiful', 'visuals', 'stunning', 'camera', 'work', 'Life', 'Pi', 'truly', 'sight', 'behold', 'how', 'essential', '3D', 'can', 'be', 'film', ""n't"", 'summer', 'blockbuster']",N/A

Tsao ""Seaview1""","[3, 5]","Yann Martel's novel, Life of Pi, had long been considered unfilmable until Oscar-winning director, Ang Lee (Brokeback Mountain), did the impossible.  He (with an adaptation by screenwriter David Magee) has made a visually stunning adventure about ultimate survival and the meaning of existence in the universe.  It is a unique film experience and one that requires openness and a certain suspension of disbelief.Pi is an impressionable young boy whose exposure to religion develops into an embracing of more than one faith much to the consternation of his father.  The family owns a zoo in the French part of India and one day are forced to uproot their lives and head to Canada by cargo ship.  During a powerful storm, the ship sinks and all hands are lost except Pi, orphaned and stranded in the middle of the Pacific Ocean with no help and a lifeboat filled with an unlikely manifest: wild animals including a tiger, oddly named Richard Parker.  An unusual dynamic plays out as Pi struggles to stay alive in the elements and contend with the ferocious beast.  As the hours turn into days and then weeks, Pi, left with only his instincts and ingenuity, is forced to improvise and utilize all his survival skills amid dwindling supplies.  When hope begins to fade for rescue, some unlikely, awe inspiring events occur that mean the difference between life and death.Lee, no stranger to computer generated effects (Hulk, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon), has done a major accomplishment here by adapting the challenging logistics of the source material and making it accessible and compelling to an audience.  He is no doubt aided by incredible advancements in special visual effects that form a significant portion of the film and recreate unforgettable moments including the fatal storm and the sinking cargo ship, the wondrous, luminescent phenomenon at night, and the depiction of animals in the lifeboat especially the tiger, Richard Parker, who becomes a major character.  Some of the imagery is remarkable in 3-D.Suraj Sharma is quite convincing as the young Pi; it's a one man show for a majority of the film. The story, told in a flashback, is about Pi's ascension to manhood, and he is in essence is a citizen of the world, not having been bound to any one religion.  His curiosity and spiritual journey serve to make this an allegorical tale, and it is his relationship with Richard Parker that serves as a foundation to the story.  He wonders about his deadly companion and ponders the question, ""Do animals have souls?""  In essence, Parker is Pi's Wilson (from Castaway) but with a soul.  Pi's interaction with the ocean is not unlike the solitary figures in The Old Man and the Sea and 127 Hours, in which mother nature can be lovely and deadly, giving and taking, a sort of protagonist and antagonist.There are unanswered questions.  What really becomes of Richard Parker? And are we to believe this fantastic tale as fact or fiction or a warped truth?  Is there a more plausible explanation?  Maybe that's just the point of the story: that life is full of questions and wonder, and sometimes truth is stranger than fiction no matter how unlikely it may appear.  Audiences who are willing to completely open their hearts and minds, will find a rewarding experience in this tragic yet fascinating exploration into the miracle of life.  And the movie does look hauntingly beautiful.",4,The Meaning of Existence in LIFE OF PI,1362873600,"03 10, 2013",2013,3393,"['Yann', 'Martel', 'novel', 'Life', 'Pi', 'had', 'long', 'been', 'considered', 'unfilmable', 'Oscar-winning', 'director', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'did', 'impossible', 'adaptation', 'screenwriter', 'David', 'Magee', 'made', 'visually', 'stunning', 'adventure', 'ultimate', 'survival', 'meaning', 'existence', 'universe', 'unique', 'film', 'experience', 'one', 'openness', 'certain', 'suspension', 'disbelief.Pi', 'impressionable', 'young', 'boy', 'exposure', 'religion', 'develops', 'embracing', 'more', 'one', 'faith', 'much', 'consternation', 'father', 'family', 'zoo', 'French', 'part', 'India', 'one', 'day', 'are', 'forced', 'uproot', 'lives', 'head', 'Canada', 'cargo', 'ship', 'powerful', 'storm', 'ship', 'sinks', 'hands', 'are', 'lost', 'Pi', 'orphaned', 'stranded', 'middle', 'Pacific', 'Ocean', 'help', 'lifeboat', 'filled', 'unlikely', 'manifest', 'wild', 'animals', 'including', 'tiger', 'oddly', 'named', 'Richard', 'Parker', 'unusual', 'dynamic', 'out', 'Pi', 'stay', 'alive', 'elements', 'contend', 'ferocious', 'beast', 'hours', 'turn', 'days', 'then', 'weeks', 'Pi', 'left', 'only', 'instincts', 'ingenuity', 'forced', 'improvise', 'utilize', 'survival', 'skills', 'dwindling', 'supplies', 'When', 'hope', 'fade', 'rescue', 'unlikely', 'awe', 'inspiring', 'events', 'occur', 'mean', 'difference', 'life', 'death.Lee', 'stranger', 'computer', 'generated', 'effects', 'Hulk', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'done', 'major', 'accomplishment', 'here', 'adapting', 'challenging', 'logistics', 'source', 'material', 'making', 'accessible', 'compelling', 'audience', 'doubt', 'aided', 'incredible', 'advancements', 'special', 'visual', 'effects', 'form', 'significant', 'portion', 'film', 'recreate', 'unforgettable', 'moments', 'including', 'fatal', 'storm', 'sinking', 'cargo', 'ship', 'wondrous', 'luminescent', 'phenomenon', 'night', 'depiction', 'animals', 'lifeboat', 'especially', 'tiger', 'Richard', 'Parker', 'who', 'major', 'character', 'imagery', 'remarkable', '3-D.Suraj', 'Sharma', 'quite', 'convincing', 'young', 'Pi', 'one', 'man', 'show', 'majority', 'film', 'story', 'told', 'flashback', 'Pi', 'ascension', 'manhood', 'essence', 'citizen', 'world', 'not', 'having', 'been', 'bound', 'one', 'religion', 'curiosity', 'spiritual', 'journey', 'serve', 'make', 'allegorical', 'tale', 'relationship', 'Richard', 'Parker', 'foundation', 'story', 'deadly', 'companion', 'question', 'Do', 'animals', 'have', 'souls', 'essence', 'Parker', 'Pi', 'Wilson', 'Castaway', 'soul', 'Pi', 'interaction', 'ocean', 'not', 'solitary', 'figures', 'Old', 'Man', 'Sea', '127', 'Hours', 'mother', 'nature', 'can', 'be', 'lovely', 'deadly', 'giving', 'taking', 'sort', 'protagonist', 'antagonist.There', 'are', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'What', 'really', 'Richard', 'Parker', 'are', 'believe', 'fantastic', 'tale', 'fact', 'fiction', 'warped', 'truth', 'more', 'plausible', 'explanation', 'Maybe', 'just', 'point', 'story', 'life', 'full', 'questions', 'wonder', 'sometimes', 'truth', 'stranger', 'fiction', 'matter', 'how', 'unlikely', 'may', 'appear', 'Audiences', 'who', 'are', 'willing', 'completely', 'open', 'hearts', 'minds', 'will', 'find', 'rewarding', 'experience', 'tragic', 'yet', 'fascinating', 'exploration', 'miracle', 'life', 'movie', 'look', 'hauntingly', 'beautiful']",N/A

1485927,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B005LAIIHG,DanD,"[2, 4]","I was assigned to read Yann Martel's LIFE OF PI in a college freshman lit class over Thanksgiving break.  I had the misfortune to fall sick that Monday, and was bedridden until Friday.  Martel's novel kept me company; in between bouts of passing out, I'd read about the epic journey of young Pi--a journey both physical and spiritual.  I loved the novel; after six years of college literary courses, it remains the only book I've been assigned that I subsequently went out and purchased, and reread, before the course was over.I never expected, or wanted, to see a film version.  Like many great books, PI is rooted in its literary origins.  And as such, the film version does suffer slightly--what comes off as exciting and insightful in the novel can seem somewhat boring and lackluster (at least, plot-wise) onscreen.  This is only to be expected.  And yet, David Magee's script sticks faithfully with the novel, right down to much of the dialogue.  In the form of our tortured hero--I use the word lightly; ""protagonist"" would be a better term--we have Suraj Sharma, giving a solid performance (the fantastic Irrfan Khan plays the older Pi, with Rafe Spall playing the Writer).  The problem with the film, aside from the slow pace (which isn't nearly so slow in book form) is that Sharma is out-acted by everything around him; that's only to be expected when you have a film that looks so absolutely beautiful.  WIth vibrant colors, rich textures, and just an overal REALNESS to the cinematography, PI blew me away (and I only watched the 2D version).But the true star here is Richard Parker, Pi's carnivorous raft-mate.  Perhaps the pinnacle of modern CGI (an actual tiger was used for some shots, but mostly it's the computers), Richard Parker comes truly to life under Ang Lee and company's masterful hands.  The fact that a fake tiger is the focal point of LIFE OF PI isn't an accident; it's a beautiful film with a dangerous edge, easily mistaken as a life-affirming, optimistic piece.  Truthfully, the film follows the novel's spirit as well as plot: you take from it what you bring to it.  Maybe its ambiguity in such matters can be counted against it; if the movie (and novel) had taken a true stand, there might be more to admire.  Still, LIFE OF PI--whichever form you approach it in, though I highly recommend the novel, even if Martel's other works fall short--is a story to make you think.  Maybe you'll walk away happy, maybe you'll walk away depressed, maybe you'll just be frustrated and confused; the point is, you'll walk away feeling SOMETHING.  And if that's not the point of art, then I'm not sure what is.",4,4.5 stars: a true surprise.,1363046400,"03 12, 2013",2013,2631,"['was', 'assigned', 'read', 'Yann', 'Martel', 'LIFE', 'OF', 'PI', 'college', 'freshman', 'lit', 'class', 'Thanksgiving', 'break', 'had', 'misfortune', 'fall', 'sick', 'Monday', 'was', 'bedridden', 'Friday', 'Martel', 'novel', 'kept', 'company', 'bouts', 'passing', 'out', ""'d"", 'read', 'epic', 'journey', 'young', 'Pi', 'journey', 'physical', 'spiritual', 'loved', 'novel', 'six', 'years', 'college', 'literary', 'courses', 'only', 'book', ""'ve"", 'been', 'assigned', 'subsequently', 'went', 'purchased', 'reread', 'course', 'was', 'over.I', 'never', 'expected', 'wanted', 'see', 'film', 'version', 'many', 'great', 'books', 'PI', 'rooted', 'literary', 'origins', 'such', 'film', 'version', 'suffer', 'slightly', 'what', 'off', 'exciting', 'insightful', 'novel', 'can', 'seem', 'somewhat', 'boring', 'lackluster', 'least', 'plot-wise', 'onscreen', 'only', 'be', 'expected', 'yet', 'David', 'Magee', 'script', 'sticks', 'faithfully', 'novel', 'right', 'down', 'much', 'dialogue', 'form', 'tortured', 'hero', 'use', 'word', 'lightly', 'protagonist', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'term', 'have', 'Suraj', 'Sharma', 'giving', 'solid', 'performance', 'fantastic', 'Irrfan', 'Khan', 'older', 'Pi', 'Rafe', 'Spall', 'playing', 'Writer', 'problem', 'film', 'aside', 'slow', 'pace', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'so', 'slow', 'book', 'form', 'Sharma', 'out-acted', 'everything', 'only', 'be', 'expected', 'when', 'have', 'film', 'so', 'absolutely', 'beautiful', 'WIth', 'vibrant', 'colors', 'rich', 'textures', 'just', 'overal', 'REALNESS', 'cinematography', 'PI', 'blew', 'away', 'only', 'watched', '2D', 'version', 'true', 'star', 'here', 'Richard', 'Parker', 'Pi', 'carnivorous', 'raft-mate', 'Perhaps', 'pinnacle', 'modern', 'CGI', 'actual', 'tiger', 'was', 'used', 'shots', 'mostly', 'computers', 'Richard', 'Parker', 'truly', 'life', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'company', 'masterful', 'hands', 'fact', 'fake', 'tiger', 'focal', 'point', 'LIFE', 'OF', 'PI', ""n't"", 'accident', 'beautiful', 'film', 'dangerous', 'edge', 'easily', 'mistaken', 'life-affirming', 'optimistic', 'piece', 'Truthfully', 'film', 'novel', 'spirit', 'as', 'well', 'plot', 'take', 'what', 'bring', 'ambiguity', 'such', 'matters', 'can', 'be', 'counted', 'movie', 'novel', 'had', 'taken', 'true', 'stand', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'admire', 'Still', 'LIFE', 'OF', 'PI', 'form', 'approach', 'highly', 'recommend', 'novel', 'even', 'Martel', 'other', 'fall', 'short', 'story', 'make', 'think', 'Maybe', ""'ll"", 'walk', 'away', 'happy', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'walk', 'away', 'depressed', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'just', 'be', 'frustrated', 'confused', 'point', ""'ll"", 'walk', 'away', 'feeling', 'SOMETHING', 'not', 'point', 'art', 'then', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what']",N/A

Most of the good reviews of this film rave about the ""3D"" version, and frankly this makes me a little sick. Beautifully photographed, yes, but you don't need to see it in 3D, a passing fancy, to be impressed by the incedible visual impact of this film. It is a Lee masterpiece, and you can hear Louis Armstrong on an old 33/rd pressing of the song ""It's a wonderful world"", and be just as impressed, in fact more so, than hearing it on a modern CD. So let's let the technocrats go here! Those glasses stink.Second, this is clearly a ""fable"", in its most wonderous sort. The second story Pi tells to the Japanese insurance agents is the True Story, while the movie shows us the Fable. Now, the fable is not a figment of imagination for Pi, it is his only way of saving himself from insanity on an ""Ocean of Loneliness"" and desperation. He believes it to be true. This is the same way that Ennis in the wonderful ""Brokeback Mountain"", also protects himself in his own ocean storm, convincing himself that he visits Jack's room, in Jack's family home with the strange settings and the equally strange parents, and retrieves some of Jack's clothing. The visit is a dream, and it gives poor Ennis just a bit of closure with the loss of his only love. The same with Pi. Having lost everything, his closure is yes, indeed, to ""become the Tiger"". When he is finally beached and rescued, the Tiger leaving him, without a goodbye, is an essential part of his soul departing, and the complete realization of this change and his tragic loss, breaks Pi's heart.You see, Lee, is a master of the psyche and the heart. He knows how to adapt a novel or screenplay to wring every bit of the ""real"" reality of the story, and how through the most compelling of needs, the imagination of humanity must create its fables to save its ""reality"", to create ""alternate realities"", completely believeable, and to the ""mind"", the truest creation of them all. This goes to the utter sadness of this movie, since all Pi has loved had died,and only Pi, the great Tiger of the mind, the admirer of so many religions in his youth, must live on. As his Father suggests early on ""get reason, first"". Pi, on the otherhand, survives, while ""reason"" finds a horrible and unending death. Fables lead to myths, and then to legends, and these finally are what casts us adrift to ceasely keep navigating our ""boats against the stream"".

I was also impressed with Irfan Khan who plays the adult version of Pi, whose role in the film is the retelling of his story to a novelist. Equally impressive was Ang Lee's direction of the film.

From the Indian locations of Pondicherry in the past, to the sequences taking place at sea, a quite wonderful evocation of an uninhabited island where the plants are predatory, to the final sequence taking place in sunlit suburbia in Canada, the film is full of memorable images.  The moments involving the animals - especially Richard Parker the tiger - are equally memorable; if they have been created using CGI, they certainly did not seem so.  Director Ang Lee has a wonderful way of suggesting the animal's predatory nature, yet at the same time its straightforwardness (unlike the human characters).  At the same time, I have to admit that the plot of LIFE OF PI is slight, to say the least: one can understand the central character's desire to discover himself and his relationship to God, but the progress of moving towards self-awareness is sometimes a slow one.

As the plot slowly develops, it takes the slant of a classical fantasy adventure, akin to the serial novels and comic strips of the early 20th century, granting the screen an entrancing, otherworldly sensibility. As is, that would've been a perfectly acceptable stylistic decision - after all, director Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon made no apologies for its less-grounded moments - but such stylish exaggerations actually become an essential part of the telling when an admission in the final act changes everything we'd just seen.

Such is the gist of Yann Martel's 2001 bestseller which is the basis of this visually stunning 2012 adventure drama helmed by Ang Lee (Brokeback Mountain). I read the book several years ago and remember thinking it would make a great animated film by someone as creative as Hayao Miyazaki (Howl's Moving Castle). CGI, however, has evolved so dramatically in the past decade that the story can be now inhabited by real actors and awash in gorgeous abstraction that melds the fantastical with the intimate quite seamlessly. Shot mostly in a giant tank in Taiwan as well as on location in India, this movie is a unique example of how technology's endless possibilities can well serve an allegorical story focused on human survival and our own individual coping mechanisms.Adapted by David Magee (Finding Neverland), the story is framed by an interview in Montreal between a Canadian writer, a fictionalized version of Martel, and an unassuming middle-aged man named Pi. The first part of the film is a flashback set in a family-run zoo in Pondicherry, a bucolic former French colony in southern India. The central protagonist is Pi as a child whose sternly sensible father runs the zoo. We learn the origins of Pi's unusual name as it relates to an impossibly pristine pool in which his uncle swam in Paris. At once, you get a sense of the importance of both water and mathematics in Pi's early life as well as his unfiltered concept of religion. In Pi's fertile mind, which religion is a moot point as he adopts Hinduism, Christianity and Islam concurrently and despite his family's resistance. A life-endangering confrontation with a Bengal tiger under their care proves to be a turning point for Pi as he is warned by his supportive family to stay away from it. Later economic hardship prompts his father to decide to move to Canada where he plans to sell the animals.The stormy journey by freighter turns tragic around the Mariana Trench where the now-teenaged Pi finds himself on a lifeboat with an unlikely menagerie in tow. The party eventually dwindles down to two, and this is where Lee imbues the film with a surreal spirit befitting the tale as we watch the seemingly incredulous situation of Pi co-existing on the lifeboat with the same tiger we saw in his childhood encounter. Dubbed Richard Parker due to a previous mix-up in paperwork, the tiger is integral to a series of eye-catching episodes that involves flying fish pelting them with force, a plethora of glowing jellyfish at night, a breaching whale nearly capsizing the boat, a disastrous storm that carries them to the brink, and a bizarrely florid island overrun with carnivorous plants and curious meerkats. None of these episodes will surprise readers of the book, but the execution is enthralling thanks to the masterful work of Chilean cinematographer Claudio Miranda (The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button) and the visual effects generated by the Rhythm & Hues Studios.Similarities to Robert Zemeckis'Cast Awayand Alfred Hitchcock'sLifeboatare probably not without intention on Lee's part, but this movie manages to hold its own. My one complaint about the film comes toward the end when things are spelled out a bit too deliberately considering how symbolic the story has been expressed up to that point. Pi is played by four actors depicting the character at different ages. Suraj Sharma effectively portrays Pi during the challenging lifeboat sequence and obviously makes the strongest impression, but Gautam Belur and Ayush Tandon are also affecting in conveying Pi's evolving psyche during his tender childhood years. Irrfan Khan (The Namesake) plays Pi in the present with his becalming demeanor seemingly at odds with the incredulous story he tells Martel.

1486029,A2PLMMVM7J0128,B005LAIIHG,Ehkzu,"[11, 16]","I'll review this for your benefit, not mine. That is, I may value certain aspects of a movie more or less than you do, or vice versa. For example, someone who flees the room if there's any violence in a movie won't want to see this firm, despite its PG rating. There's violence and it's a scary movie at times. Not like, say, ""Saving Private Ryan"" but it isn't an episode of ""Friends"" either.And after seeing this film last night (and never having read the book or read about the book), I would make a few blanket recommendations:1. See this in 3D unless 3D makes you oopsy (as it does a friend of my wife's). I think most people would agree that this film goes far past poke-you-in-the 3D, but instead makes the visual depth integral with the cinematography.2. See this in Blu-Ray if not in a theater. Its visual quality is both right up there at the state of the art, AND it's a major part of the film's appeal.3. Avoid reading any other reviews of the film but this one before you see it, because I won't give you any spoilers, and most reviewers--pro and amateur--do. And in the case of ""Life of Pi"" it's really important to avoid spoilers. This movie is especially skillful at giving nothing away as you go along, while not ""cheating"" and hiding anything either. A friend who had seen it before warned me to suspect my sense of disbelief for this--that I wouldn't be sorry afterwards, despite my tendency to dissect-as-I-go, and she was right.Why you might not want to see this film:1. It's not a typical ""good"" Hollywood film, with a propulsive plot and an array of famous stars you enjoy watching in films. None of the actors are much known in America. So despite some intense action sequences, on the whole it's not a swiftly-paced film.2. It's not a love story. And if you enjoy watching beautiful men and women interact onscreen for a couple of hours, this ain't that. It's a half-naked 17 year old boy not interacting with other people through most of it (though not uninterruptedly).3. It's not an action movie per se.4. It's not a horror movie, and it's not really any other well-known genre. I was reminded a bit of Terence Malick's films like ""The Thin Red Line,"" which is more a meditation on war than a regular war movie.5. This is a bit of a judgment call, but I'd say the screenwriting and acting are competent but not spectacular. However, the visuals throughout are spectacular. The plot is interesting, though some say it isn't as philosophically deep as it thinks it is. Could be; not a big problem for me.6. If you're a religious ideologue, firmly committed to your faith--whatever it is--and believing all other faiths are worthless and must be shunned, you're going to find this off-putting. Maybe you could watch it with the sound off for the glorious visuals.7. I would have taken my kids to see this film when they were young, but only after talking about it with them to make sure they wanted to see a film that skirts the upper end of violence and scary action acceptable in a PG film. Parents who are raising their kid in a ""sweetness & light"" bubble shouldn't take their kids to see it.Why you might want to see it:1. The absolute state of the art in 3D cinematography and mise-en-scene, and in a director exploiting 3D for narrative effect and not just 3D for 3D's sake.2. A tale that's more interesting in retrospect than it was during most of the movie--it definitely left me mulling it over afterwards, and satisfyingly so.3. Absence of the shadow big box office stars cast over a story.4. If you're a scuba diver like me, or just like watching underwater specials, there are some great visuals for us here, and as a diver I can tell you that the underwater stuff is solidly reality-based, fantastic though some of it seems. Probably the same goes for anyone who's a naturalist of some sort. A lot of Wonders of Nature here.5. If you're religious but very ecumenical or nonreligious but not judgmental about religion (except for the fundamentalist stuff), you'll probably enjoy this movie. It definitely has that ""we are all One with the Infinite, and it/them/him/her with us"" vibe.6. It doesn't anthropomorphize the animals in the film. Unsentimental, really.7. If you're a woman or a homosexual man you might enjoy watching a half-naked 17 year old youth for the better part of two hours. Me being neither this wasn't a drawing card for me but I'm sure it would be for some, and my job here isn't to tell myself whether or not to see it, but to tell you--whoever you are.8. This is one of those films that I think will be talked about for years, so it you're a film buff, you probably need to have seen it just to keep up with movie conversations.9. This would be a great movie to see with the whole family and talk about afterwards, as long as your kids can handle the most violence & scary action possible for a film to have & still get a PG rating.----------------------------------------------------I didn't leave the theater powerfully moved, but then I AM a scuba diver, so I've seen a lot of marine stuff myself, up close and personal. I thoroughly enjoyed it, though--enough to write a review here.One last note: I've been stranded by myself in the open ocean with no rescue in sight several times. It only lasted a matter of minutes, but I can tell you it's an intense experience even when it's short (one time after a night dive on a moonless night in an obscure chain of islands west of New Guinea was especially intense). So I can relate to the castaway aspect of this film--which is its heart in some ways--in ways that are outside the personal experience of most filmgoers. And I think this does a fair job of capturing that feeling. It brought back my memories of floating along in the water pretty strongly!I will have other conversations about ""Life of Pi"" with friends who have seen it, but I won't spoil it for you by going into those aspects.",4,No-spoilers review--and you really want that for this one!,1358640000,"01 20, 2013",2013,5901,"[""'ll"", 'review', 'benefit', 'not', 'mine', 'may', 'value', 'certain',

Where did that moment of inspiration come from? Why did I think that religion and zoology would make a good mix? ...I could give approximate answers.

I, too, now live with a very large and very dangerous animal.  This is a fight for survival, it is no game, it is no fairy tale.  I feed the beast as best I can and try to avoid it.  Ultimately, I must learn about it and it must - in some way - co-exist with me.  Together, uncomfortable companions, we seek safe harbor.  Safe harbor is far from safe, it is self-consuming.  The only safety is in not looking for it; the only path is back into the journey, the beast and I, toward life.  Can we find it, can we survive? I will not be consumed by the beast, but neither can I consume it.  We are together now, whatever the future.Shall I tell my story in its brutal reality, tearing into the consciousness and sensitivities of those who hear it?  I learn that this is not a prudent choice.  And so I tell it in this way, as I have said, the beast and I.  Everyone fears the beast, do they not?  Yet, not everyone travels with one, and so the story can be safely told.There is magic and even beauty in even the worst horror.  Nothing is without purpose; this is part of the lesson.You cannot tame the beast.  There must be a partnership, a reluctant partnership.  You may find comfort in the oddest of places and when least expected but, ultimately, you must continue the journey.  Or die trying.""Even when God seemed to have abandoned me, He was watching.  Even when He seemed indifferent to my suffering, He was watching.  And when I was beyond all hope of saving, He gave me rest, and gave me a sign to continue my journey.""Evil and horror are real, but they are encapsulated, they are quarantined from the essential element of soul.  The beast can enter our lives; we can succumb to the horror and be eaten alive, by our own lack of hope and loss of faith.  Or we can arrive at a place where we, and our beast, co-exist.  I am not yet at the place where my beast leaves me.  Perhaps I never will be.  There is something in us that wants to hold onto the beast.  And we are left with two stories: the horror or the hope.""Can I ask you something?""""Of course.""""I've told you two stories  about what happened out on the ocean.  Neither explains what caused the sinking of the ship and no one can prove which story is true and which is not.

1486043,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B005LAIIHG,Enjolras,"[4, 6]","It's not often that I say that a movie is better than the book upon which it was based. But Life of Pi takes what I thought was a simple and unemotive book and creates a visually stunning and emotionally evocative movie.As other reviews are noted, this movie is a visual masterpiece. Ang Lee injects the film with a bold and unique visual style. There's rarely a boring frame in this movie. There's always an interesting composition or lighting effect on the screen. That's no small achievement given that the story primarily takes place on a small boat with a single actor and a CGI tiger. I'm not often wowed by special effects, but some of the shots from underwater really were impressive.I think Ang Lee and actor Suraj Sharma did a great job at drawing the emotional story out of this book. As I wrote in my review of the novel, the writing style is a bit dry and doesn't really evoke any emotions. However, Suraj Sharma's narration adds real depth to his character. He's not just telling viewers how he caught fish, but also conveying his grim determination to survive. I'm sure it's easier for live actors to convey emotion than it is for words on a page, but I found myself caring far more about the characters in the movie than I ever did in the book.The movie is very faithful to the book. Perhaps surprisingly so. Ang Lee even kept the part in about Pi's conversion to Christianity and Islam. Again, I thought this was an improvement over the book. I thought the book spent far too much time in the beginning with random musings. The movie presents the same information but much more efficiently and beautifully.Overall, I'd imagine this movie will please fans of the book, as well as any viewers who appreciate a good yarn.

The opening sequence had beautiful 3D renderings and whetted my apetite for a 3D extravaganza - but the rest of the film wasn't so 3-dimensional as the opening. Fortunately, the core story was quite engrossing, well told, and visually exciting even without much use of the 3rd dimension.  I'll find fault with a metaphorical turn at the end, without mentioning plot details.  There was a brief exegesis in the film, which was in my opinion almost unnecessary, and too brief to make much of the metaphors.  That sent me to the book, which i hadn't read, where I found a much more detailed exegesis, which was interesting, but would have required more preparation in the earlier part of the story in order to make it possible for the themes to make sense.  That might have been a good idea, since there was a little puppy-love story that ended up being a loose end in the film.

I still feel so overwhelmed by it, its visual splendor and the moving story that kept me involved for the whole time. The latest Ang Lee's film is beauty itself, and everyone involved in creation of such sparkling intelligent and classy entertainment deserves the highest praise and admiration for the work they've done.  I am sure that in two days, ""Life of Pi"" will receive majority of Oscars it is nominated for. It deserves them.I hesitated to see it because I did not think that the movie about a boy and a tiger stuck together in the middle of the ocean for months after the horrible shipwreck on the drifting lifeboat which the ferocious tiger first claimed as his territory and a makeshift inflatable raft chained to it which was Pi's fragile shelter would be so compelling and gripping but it was. Roger Ebert said that Life of Pi is ""a miraculous achievement of storytelling and a landmark of visual mastery"". I gladly agree with that. I simply can't find anything wrong with ""Life of Pi."" It is beautiful, profound and adventurous story of survival and understanding life with all it offers or throws at us.  It is life affirming even though it takes us along with Pi Patel through unspeakable hardship, losses, and deadly danger of indifferent and indomitable forces of nature's elements and wild creatures. And it manages to say a lot about faith and God without being over-simplistic, preachy or shoving religion in your face. It does help an atheist to understand the believers or at least to try. It also turns itself in unexpected direction when we thought we were in the end of the journey, reflects on the darkest corners of human nature and leaves the viewers asking questions on what they really want to believe and whether they are open to the possibility of miracle in life, in their lives. It is up to the viewers to choose the answer only they would be satisfied with.Peaceful beauty of Pondicherry, former French colony in India that surprisingly for me looked like a charming small French town, totally enthralled me in the beginning of the film that started as a typical coming of age story. Well, it is coming of age story but amazing on so many levels, spiritual, ethical, physical, religious, humanistic, testing the limits of what a human being can deal with and how it would shape him, his life, and his perception of life.  This is an experience, both movie watching and afterthought that will stay with me. What else can I ask for in a movie?  I've always respected and admired Ang Lee and found his movies exquisite.

1486085,AU10YGO10MUCA,B005LAIIHG,Gary Lee,"[0, 0]","LIFE OF PI is visually stunning.  I observed tigers at close quarters for years as a volunteer at a preserve for big cats.  I was completely fooled by the CGI in the creation of ""Richard Parker,"" although I began to catch on when the tiger did things it was difficult for me imagine a tiger doing, like climbing into a boat or catching and eating a live rat flung at it.  In terms of the story, these moves seemed possible, given the extreme circumstances the tiger was in.  I just wasn't sure of a real tiger, a Hollywood working animal, being successfully trained to do these things.The action at heart is an old-fashioned adventure tale of survival at sea with an unusual twist, told more with humor than desperation.  It strives to present the story as a spiritual one, but like the journalist (an off-putting performance by Rafe Spall.  Why would a stranger open up to this blank, boring boob?) I was underwhelmed by that aspect.  The ""inspirational"" thrust felt scrambled and overreaching, and once Pi is at sea, secondary.  I had only a tenuous idea by the end what all this was supposed to have to do with God.  Part of the problem may have been the sound in the all-important reveal Pi makes to the insurance investigators at the end.  Suraj Sharma's accent was too thick and his speech too fast for me to catch a lot of what he said.  Was it me, or was the sound poorly handled in this scene?  I've seen the film three times--still can't get it all.But I got the tiger.  Who hasn't felt at times trapped, abandoned, marooned, to face a proverbial tiger of some sort in our own lives completely on our own?  When Pi attributes his survival to Richard Parker for keeping him alert and active, the emotional truth resonated.  Overcoming a challenge to survival has been the making of many a man or woman.The greatness of this film lies not in its metaphors but in its awesome visual sweep.  I've never seen water look so crystal clear on screen.  Its appearance alone carries mystical implications.  The movie needs to be seen on the big screen to get its full meaning, for on the big screen the water not only thrills but illuminates.  Note that in the editorial review above, Kathleen Fennessey compares the brutal storm in this movie to TITANIC.  Puzzling, as there is no ""horrific"" storm in TITANIC.  Perhaps she meant to compare it to THE PERFECT STORM--whatever--but she's got her storms, and her movies, scrambled.  The water effects in LIFE OF PI range from being as shimmering and evocative as a Monet painting, to being a terrifying cataclysm.  TITANIC has nothing to compare with it.  In LIFE OF PI, the water is alive, one of the primary characters, and makes the movie come alive.",4,"Forget the Religion, Go With the Tiger",1364860800,"04 2, 2013",2013,2700,"['LIFE', 'OF', 'PI', 'visually', 'stunning', 'observed', 'tigers', 'close', 'quarters', 'years', 'volunteer', 'preserve', 'big', 'cats', 'was', 'completely', 'fooled', 'CGI', 'creation', 'Richard', 'Parker', 'began', 'catch', 'when', 'tiger', 'did', 'things', 'was', 'difficult', 'imagine', 'tiger', 'doing', 'climbing', 'boat', 'catching', 'eating', 'live', 'rat', 'flung', 'terms', 'story', 'moves', 'seemed', 'possible', 'given', 'extreme', 'circumstances', 'tiger', 'was', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'real', 'tiger', 'Hollywood', 'working', 'animal', 'being', 'successfully', 'trained', 'do', 'things.The', 'action', 'heart', 'old-fashioned', 'adventure', 'tale', 'survival', 'sea', 'unusual', 'twist', 'told', 'more', 'humor', 'desperation', 'present', 'story', 'spiritual', 'one', 'journalist', 'off-putting', 'performance', 'Rafe', 'Spall', 'Why', 'would', 'stranger', 'open', 'up', 'blank', 'boring', 'boob', 'was', 'underwhelmed', 'aspect', 'inspirational', 'thrust', 'felt', 'scrambled', 'overreaching', 'once', 'Pi', 'sea', 'secondary', 'had', 'only', 'tenuous', 'idea', 'end', 'what', 'was', 'supposed', 'have', 'do', 'God', 'Part', 'problem', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'sound', 'all-important', 'reveal', 'Pi', 'insurance', 'investigators', 'end', 'Suraj', 'Sharma', 'accent', 'was', 'too', 'thick', 'speech', 'too', 'fast', 'catch', 'lot', 'what', 'said', 'Was', 'was', 'sound', 'poorly', 'handled', 'scene', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'three', 'times', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'all.But', 'got', 'tiger', 'Who', ""n't"", 'felt', 'times', 'trapped', 'abandoned', 'marooned', 'face', 'proverbial', 'tiger', 'sort', 'own', 'lives', 'completely', 'own', 'When', 'Pi', 'survival', 'Richard', 'Parker', 'keeping', 'alert', 'active', 'emotional', 'truth', 'resonated', 'Overcoming', 'challenge', 'survival', 'been', 'making', 'many', 'man', 'woman.The', 'greatness', 'film', 'not', 'metaphors', 'awesome', 'visual', 'sweep', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'water', 'look', 'crystal', 'clear', 'screen', 'appearance', 'alone', 'mystical', 'implications', 'movie', 'be', 'seen', 'big', 'screen', 'get', 'full', 'meaning', 'big', 'screen', 'water', 'not', 'only', 'Note', 'editorial', 'review', 'Kathleen', 'Fennessey', 'brutal', 'storm', 'movie', 'TITANIC', 'Puzzling', 'horrific', 'storm', 'TITANIC', 'Perhaps', 'meant', 'compare', 'THE', 'PERFECT', 'STORM', 'got', 'storms', 'movies', 'scrambled', 'water', 'effects', 'LIFE', 'OF', 'PI', 'range', 'being', 'shimmering', 'evocative', 'Monet', 'painting', 'being', 'terrifying', 'cataclysm', 'TITANIC', 'nothing', 'compare', 'LIFE', 'OF', 'PI', 'water', 'alive', 'one', 'primary', 'characters', 'movie', 'come', 'alive']",N/A

But if it's approached that way, the beginning and ending of the film seem hard to reconcile.  This film presents a question that gets to the heart of religious faith in a way that both the believer and the non-believer can appreciate.  It's about all religions, not just one.  Pi is serially attracted to several of the world's major faiths, but the unique dogma of each is not the appeal.  It's the idea of religion that is the subject of the film.  Soon after the scene is set, Pi endures a terrifying ordeal involving a tiger and a lifeboat.  When it's over, he tells his story to skeptical investigators.  What has really happened here?  By posing the question the way it does the film offers an answer that tries to unravel the nature of faith and the purpose of belief.

1486106,A328S9RN3U5M68,B005LAIIHG,Grady Harp,"[4, 5]","As is obvious from the number of rave reviews this film LIFE OF PI was are sounding success in the theaters when it was shown in 3D. There is no question but that the story, so well known over the past decades since the publication of the book of the same name by Yann Martel, draws everybody in, whether because of the indomitable spirit of our surviving hero or the religious aspects of the story.  Perhaps because of all the hoopla about director Ang Lee's manipulation of CGI effects and the endless interviews about the making of the film that make the final product (on DVD at least) seem so contrived and unreal that some viewers will find the end product less than satisfying a version of the novel. David Magee sculpted the screenplay from the novel and while that provides a lot of background about the character of Pi before the main event of the lost at see episode, it does seem disruptive at times and in this viewer's response robs the story form some of the poetry.The story has been summarized elsewhere as follows: `In Canada, a writer visits the Indian storyteller Pi Patel and asks him to tell a story. Pi tells the story of his life since he was a kid in Pondicherry, India and the origin of his nickname. One day, his father who owns a zoo tells his family that his business is not good and he had decided to move to Canada and sell part of the animals in the United States. They travel in a Japanese cargo ship with the animals and out of the blue, there is a storm followed by a shipwrecking. Pi survives in a lifeboat with a zebra, a orangutan, a hyena and a male Bengal tiger called Richard Parker. They are adrift in the Pacific Ocean and when the tiger is hungry, he eats the other animals. Soon Pi learns that he might find a way to feed and domesticate the tiger to survive.The character of Pi Patel is played for the most part by Suraj Sharma while his earlier years embodiments are shared by Ayush Tandon and Gautam Belur and the adult storyteller by Irrfan Khan. Pi's parents are played by Adil Hussain  and Gita Patel and his brother Ravi by, depending on age, Ayan Khan, Mohd Abbas Khaleeli, and Vibish Sivakumar,  Rafe Spall is the writer who will create the book from Pi's story, and for a few brief moments G&eacute;rard Depardieu plays a Cook on the ship.There are some very beautiful scenes of skies and waterscapes, but we are left wondering how much of this is carton created in the large studio tank that serves as the ocean. Some of Martell's original explanation of the various religions Pi adheres to are retained: they were the best part of the novel. Perhaps in 3D this film would have worked better.

1486154,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B005LAIIHG,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[6, 9]","This film is a marvellous adventure that is not done for little children who will get frightened but for children closer to 77 than to 7 years of age. But it is such a beautiful story that adults might like it too.Frightening like hell not on earth but on the Pacific Ocean. A shipwreck that sinks a cargo boat with only one survivor, a teenager hardly able to use a razor to shave and three animals from his father's zoo, animals that were being taken away to Canada to be sold: a Bengali tiger, a zebra and a hyena. The hyena is ignominious and it attacks the zebra on the lifeboat without even hesitating. The tiger is another story and the teenager is still another novel all by himself.But when you want to survive and you have in you the god that supports you, not a god with a trunk as long as a nose, or vice versa, not a god that dies on the cross for others, not a god that is hermaphrodite according to your capricious desires. Not at all. A god that is powerful in your soul, inspiring in your spirit, supportive in your mind and absolutely logical in your brain. Then you have the force with you and you can stand up against a Bengali tiger and tame it, and you can stamp your feet against the elements and organize your survival and that of ""your"" tiger.Then you have the mysterious island of Doctor Moreau, a carnivorous island that is also slightly cannibalistic. It is all sweet and nice in the day time but it turns flesh voracious at night. Can you imagine a tender teenager with no hairs on his face and a Bengali tiger: that's what I would call a meat ravenous predator's delicatessen treat.What is surprising but not so much if you know animals slightly is the tiger's taming. A wild animal will accept in some extreme conditions to be tamed when it feels you are the one who is going to help it survive if it lets you survive. Animals are intelligent and in extreme conditions they know their interest. I was told that many times in Sri Lanka where I used to walk in the jungle. I was told that if on your way a lion, a wild cat or an elephant comes to cross it towards its own destination, don't run, don't scream, don't make any brusque movement. The animal knew you were coming a long time before you ever knew it was there. If you don't block its way, if you do not produce the mammal hormone of fear that stinks like hell, if you look at the animal straight in the eyes and at the most slowly step back without getting your eyes away from its nor turning you back onto it, the animal will not attack you, and in fact most of the time the animal will avoid you and you will never see it though you might walk a few yards away from it.Animals are intelligent and they are not necessarily man's predators, even Bengali tigers.But when the animal will no longer need Pi it will just walk away back into its own animal life without even looking back. A wild animal can be tamed but it will never be the pet of a human being.The second lesson is that the insurance company of the ship does not accept that strange story with a tamed tiger and a carnivorous island, but it accepts quite well the story of four survivors with the odious cook who eats a rat, cuts up a sailor to catch fish, kills the mother of the hero and is killed by the hero himself. That sounds absurd in a way but human beings prefer a gross and totally inhuman story to a marvellous story about a wild animal that accepts to be tamed to survive and then walks away.The last idea or rather warning is that if some of you are secular minded to the point of negating any possible divinity or superior being or even superior force, don't go. This film is not about the gods we know in any religion but about the god that lives in your skull and animates you so strongly that it makes you able to survive in numerous situations without being a monster and using your fellow traveller as bait for sharks. Even if that fellow traveller is a wild Bengali tiger you have to tame it first. In fact if that god, like Jesus, you have him in your mind, brain, soul, spirit or whatever, dying on the cross becomes like an easy mission that you will not even try to evade or suspend or escape from.Too bad for those who consider any religious or mystic belief is an alienation and a fairy tale for dummies, because I know so many people who are beautiful for others and empathetic for any suffering just because in them they have the gem of that transcendence.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,My God is in me and I have a tiger in my soul,1356912000,"12 31, 2012",2012,4459,"['film', 'marvellous', 'adventure', 'not', 'done', 'little', 'children', 'who', 'will', 'get', 'frightened', 'children', 'closer', '77', '7', 'years', 'age', 'such', 'beautiful', 'story', 'adults', 'might', 'like', 'too.Frightening', 'hell', 'not', 'earth', 'Pacific', 'Ocean', 'A', 'shipwreck', 'cargo', 'boat', 'only', 'one', 'survivor', 'teenager', 'hardly', 'able', 'use', 'razor', 'shave', 'three', 'animals', 'father', 'zoo', 'animals', 'were', 'being', 'taken', 'away', 'Canada', 'be', 'sold', 'Bengali', 'tiger', 'zebra', 'hyena', 'hyena', 'ignominious', 'zebra', 'lifeboat', 'even', 'hesitating', 'tiger', 'story', 'teenager', 'still', 'novel', 'himself.But', 'when', 'want', 'survive', 'have', 'god', 'not', 'god', 'trunk', 'as', 'long', 'nose', 'vice', 'versa', 'not', 'god', 'cross', 'others', 'not', 'god', 'hermaphrodite', 'according', 'capricious', 'desires', 'Not', 'A', 'god', 'powerful', 'soul', 'inspiring', 'spirit', 'supportive', 'mind', 'absolutely', 'logical', 'brain', 'Then', 'have', 'force', 'can', 'stand', 'up', 'Bengali', 'tiger', 'tame', 'can', 'stamp', 'feet', 'elements', 'organize', 'survival', 'tiger.Then', 'have', 'mysterious', 'island', 'Doctor', 'Moreau', 'carnivorous', 'island', 'also', 'slightly', 'cannibalistic', 'sweet', 'nice', 'day', 'time', 'flesh', 'voracious', 'night', 'Can', 'imagine', 'tender', 'teenager', 'hairs', 'face', 'Bengali', 'tiger', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'meat', 'ravenous', 'predator', 'delicatessen', 'treat.What', 'surprising', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'know', 'animals', 'slightly', 'tiger', 'taming', 'wild', 'animal', 'will', 'accept', 'extreme', 'conditions', 'be', 'tamed', 'when', 'are', 'one', 'who', 'going', 'help', 'survive', 'survive', 'Animals', 'are', 'intelligent', 'extreme', 'conditions', 'know', 'interest', 'was', 'told', 'many', 'times', 'Sri', 'Lanka', 'where', 'used', 'walk', 'jungle', 'was', 'told', 'way', 'lion', 'wild', 'cat', 'elephant', 'cross', 'towards', 'own', 'destination', 'do', ""n't"", 'run', 'do', ""n't"", 'scream', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'brusque', 'movement', 'animal', 'knew', 'were', 'coming', 'long', 'time', 'ever', 'knew', 'was', 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'block', 'way', 'do', 'not', 'produce', 'mammal', 'hormone', 'fear', 'stinks', 'hell', 'look', 'animal', 'straight', 'eyes', 'most', 'slowly', 'step', 'back', 'getting', 'eyes', 'away', 'turning', 'back', 'animal', 'will', 'not', 'attack', 'fact', 'most', 'time', 'animal', 'will', 'avoid', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'might', 'walk', 'few', 'yards', 'away', 'it.Animals', 'are', 'intelligent', 'are', 'not', 'necessarily', 'man', 'predators', 'even', 'Bengali', 'tigers.But', 'when', 'animal', 'will', 'no', 'longer', 'need', 'Pi', 'will', 'just', 'walk', 'away', 'back', 'own', 'animal', 'life', 'even', 'looking', 'back', 'A', 'wild', 'animal', 'can', 'be', 'tamed', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'pet', 'human', 'being.The', 'second', 'lesson', 'insurance', 'company', 'ship', 'not', 'accept', 'strange', 'story', 'tamed', 'tiger', 'carnivorous', 'island', 'quite', 'well', 'story', 'four', 'survivors', 'odious', 'cook', 'who', 'rat', 'up', 'sailor', 'catch', 'fish', 'mother', 'hero', 'killed', 'hero', 'absurd', 'way', 'human', 'beings', 'prefer', 'gross', 'totally', 'inhuman', 'story', 'marvellous', 'story', 'wild', 'animal', 'be', 'tamed', 'survive', 'then', 'walks', 'away.The', 'last', 'idea', 'rather', 'warning', 'are', 'secular', 'minded', 'point', 'negating', 'possible', 'divinity', 'superior', 'being', 'even', 'superior', 'force', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'film', 'not', 'gods', 'know', 'religion', 'god', 'skull', 'so', 'strongly', 'able', 'survive', 'numerous', 'situations', 'being', 'monster', 'using', 'fellow', 'traveller', 'bait', 'sharks', 'Even', 'fellow', 'traveller', 'wild', 'Bengali', 'tiger', 'have', 'tame', 'first', 'fact', 'god', 'Jesus', 'have', 'mind', 'brain', 'soul', 'spirit', 'whatever', 'dying', 'cross', 'easy', 'mission', 'will', 'not', 'even', 'try', 'evade', 'suspend', 'escape', 'from.Too', 'bad', 'who', 'consider', 'religious', 'mystic', 'belief', 'alienation', 'fairy', 'tale', 'dummies', 'know', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'beautiful', 'others', 'empathetic', 'suffering', 'just', 'have', 'gem', 'transcendence.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",N/A

Imagine my surprise when I discovered that I did not like it, in fact I disliked it! To me, the story of an Indian boy who is shipwrecked with a zebra, a hyena, an orangutan and a Bengal tiger is a bit much.With the astonishing Ang Lee as the director (""The Wedding Banquet,"" ""Sense and Sensibility,"" ""Brokeback Mountain,"" ""Hulk,"" and ""The Ice Storm""), things started looking up. As you can see from this sample of his work, this much-acclaimed artist never stays with one genre, never copies other filmmakers and never plays it safe. He rarely makes a PG film and I think this is his first 3D project.He did wonders with his cast:* Suraj Sharma (in his first film role) is Pi, an adventurous, inquisitive youngster. He has settled on being a vegetarian Hindu Muslim who embraces Catholic guilt, studies the Jewish Kabbalah, and wants to be baptized. He is convinced that religion is a big house with many rooms.* Irrfan Khan (""Slumdog Millionaire"" and ""The Amazing Spider-Man"") is the adult Pi, who tells his spellbinding tale to a would-be author.* Rafe Spall (""Prometheus"") is our incredulous listener, The Writer, who speaks for us as he expresses all the confusion, dismay and doubt that we in the audience naturally feel.* The tiger who plays Richard Parker is a seamless combination of real life and computer generated images. Brilliant!3D is rarely used this well, maybe you can get a new player from Amazon. The opening credit sequence that takes us through a small municipal zoo in India is a marvel, and the scenes with clear water are breathtaking: you can't tell water from air, so things seem to be floating above the earth. Kudos to Cinematographer Claudio Miranda for the dazzling effects! (We LOVED the flying fish!)The continuity is consistently good: as time goes by in the lifeboat, our hero and our tiger are visibly thinner, the tiger's teeth become greenish and both of them have dry unhealthy hair. The shipwreck is tough to see, but we don't have to watch carnivores kill their lunch, and when Pi finally brains a fish, he weeps and apologizes to it. Don't show this to toddlers, but from ten years old and up, I think a child can handle it.In my opinion, this was much better than the book!

My loathing of this film is an active and ongoing thing. Life of Pi starts off nicely enough with an interesting story that you think is going in one direction and then whip lashes you in another... Fair enough I suppose, I don't mind being surprised. What offended me the most was the extreme violence depicted in the film. Had I lived back in the days of the Roman Empire, I would NOT have been front row center when they brought the animals out for slaughter. Yet, for the entire second half of the movie, we are asked to sit and watch the surviving animals from a shipwreck kill and eat one another in a tiny lifeboat.

On only rare occasions in my life have I been let down to this extent.I borrowed the movie from my local library at the cost of one dollar. It wasn't worth it. The whole time I was watching it I was thinking, ""What the hell is the point of this movie?? Is it going to get better any time soon??"" I had to fight to stay awake. It was two hours of my life that went irretrievably down the drain.I am absolutely at a loss to understand how any sane person could rate this movie anything higher than one star. What a profoundly ridiculous premise:  the kid is in a life boat adrift on the ocean along with a tiger, a zebra, an orangutan, and a hyena who take turns getting ""lost"" under a tarp that covers the front half of the lifeboat. They somehow magically appear at various times to provide material for each scene. One can almost hear the director out of sight saying, ""Okay, cue the tiger!"" The hyena and tiger pose an obvious threat to Pi's existence, but he easily could have just charged them when they were near the edge of the boat and...viola!...into the drink they go. No more threat. Oh wait, I forgot.

Yes, there are still some fine movies being made (even some of the &#34;tent-pole&#34; blockbusters are satisfying) but 'Life of Pi' is as rewarding and, in its own way, as awe-inspiring as any of the current epic releases helmed by bigger budgets and bigger names. Under genius Ang Lee's impeccable direction the uplifting and absolutely heart-breaking tale of Pi and Richard Parker is brought to spectacular CGI &#34;life&#34; with an added and unmistakable dose of dignified Humanity so lacking today, not only in our movies but across our culture. The film is essentially a parable, in my opinion, about the perception of truth and how the human spirit creates magic out of unspeakable tragedy in the attempt to draw meaning and find redemption where there is little of either to be found. Is it the story of a young Indian boy adrift in a lifeboat on the ocean for 227 days with a Bengal tiger as his simultaneous enemy and companion? That, dear moviegoer or movie-watcher, is for YOU to decide. The exhilarating thing about 'Life of Pi' is that you will be amazed by it, and you will find yourself thinking about it. Most truly. Kudos to Ang Lee and everyone involved with the meticulous and admirable execution of this very special film experience. For those who first warmed to the tale via the  book by Yann Martel, rest assured that the spirit of that classic work is painstakingly preserved and adapted with humility and no small amount of splendor. A feast for the eyes, the senses and, especially, for the heart. Adults will hold this film dear, but if you have kids over age 9 (or maybe 12) get them to watch it with you.

From the indelible images of animals in a zoo that flood our field of vision over the opening credits to its final moments in a questionable raft riding rough pounding seas, the maestro creates a singular unified story for the ages...and all ages too.  Hard to imagine as a novel I never read, the book was not expected to yield such a bounty of sheer beauty and natural punch, but holy cow, it does!  Its a blockbuster And then some.  Even on DVD.

But recently I found out I was completely dead wrong about this Film. I do not know where to begin. Suraj Sharma plays the title character Pi and he does it realistically. Pi is everything I would hope to be in his situation: brave, courageous, and daring. This movie also proves (and does a really good job at it) that help can come from the most unlikely ally. That being said, the storyline is top notch in this film and it is deeply moving. The supporting cast is good, but the surprise in this film (and i think many will agree) are the effects and visuals. Ang Lee Deserves not only a tip of the hat, but in my opinion he deserves a standing ovation for making such an enjoyable film. Quoting one of the lines from the film ""I was told you have a story that would make me believe in God,""  And in my honest opinion, this film has done that and so much more. 5 stars",5,Absolutely Fantastic!!!

I loved this book when I first read it, and I had trouble getting it out of my head for months.  My experience with movies made from books that I have loved has been mixed - some of the movies have been enjoyable and some have been disappointing, all for many and varied reasons, so I settled down in front of the flat screen TV to watch Life of Pi with my best open mind.Although it has been a few years since I read the book, the movie brought it back to me in waves of memories.  The film was visually stunning to me (You must stream this movie in HD to be stunned), and I didn't feel cheated by not having it in 3D, since the 5.1 surround sound was enough realism for me.  The tiger was magnificently created and was as real to me as any real tiger could be.  The love that Pi and Richard Parker shared developed as tenderly as any love story could, and showed the reality of human misperception of &#34;taming&#34; a wild animal. Pi was convincinly played as an adorable, if somewhat irascible, young man and as an engaging, deeply thoughtful adult.As with the book, the movie left me totally satisfied with the experience of the story, and with renewed questions about which version of Pi's story was really real.

1486251,A2RYXCJ91AQPS9,B005LAIIHG,judy,"[2, 7]","A Beautiful Masterpiece !!! While it starts out very slow and boring it gets exciting and scary and dramatic - very dramatic !!!. Ok sents their is only two things about this film that i didn't enjoy lets start out with that ok lets begin. The beginning of this movie well lets say the first um 30 minutes of the movie were pretty ugg slow. I was bored out of my mine with it i swear. It was so slow and boring that i thought about leaving the theater and seeing Red Dawn but i didn't. The beginning was just um well it didn't fit with the rest of the film and was not very nessesary to me. I mean all of that story about religion and falling for a girl for about five minutes then leaving her i mean come on was all of that nessesary really???? No it was not. The acting in the beginning was great but all together unnessesary. It was boring with only the part with the tiger being interesting. But after that half an hour the film started to get great, i mean really really good. The huge storm scene with the ship was epic, it was really, really cool. Actually there were lots of scenes that i found amazingly beautiful like the part with the whale and the animals who looked infact real but they were not they were animated but they were done so well they looked real.The second thing that i didn't enjoy was the removal of Tobey Maguire. Tobey Maguire was like way better at his acting as the writer then Rafe Spall was way better and sents the director decided to cut tobey like 2 months from the films release they had to like rush the reshoots and it made those scenes look well bad it was sad they cut him. It was a really bad move. Ok the good stuff well you already heard about the beauty in the film but i will still talk more about it, the acting in particuler the newcomer Suraj Sharma who to me did a realistic and great preformence, the cast,The director , the animation, the scenery , and everything else. Ok almost every scene int his film looks like a diamond all sparkly and well pollashed, i'm not stretching the point they made every scene look better then the scene before it was just so pretty and man did i want to eat it up loved it. It was just so cool. The acting was very very good outside of Rafe Spall everybody looked like they really were enjoying filming of Life of Pi, Suraj Sharma in particuler gave a 101 % in trying he was great i loved him. I thought sad to say i thought he was going to give a really bad preformence but when i saw the film he was just amazing. Man Suraj Sharma has real talent in acting he does i hope the best for him. In the future i hope he is able to get more good leading film roles cause he deserves them he really does which leads me into my next conversation about the casting. Man i'm sad to say that now adays directors only cast well known actors in their movies like Will Ferral or Kevin James but the director who is really greatchose a cast of well newcomers who had little to no acting experience which worked for everyone but for the cutting of tobey who we already talked about.I believe directors should cast no more then 2 well known actors and put them in supporting roles with little advertisment on them sort of like Alice in Wonderland but they advertised the Mad Hater who was played by Johnny Depp like he was the main charactor and put him on the posters but they rarly advertised alice who IS the main charactor and she is not even on the poster i mean whats up with that its really stupid!!! The director was very good with casting which leads me into my next subject on the director. I rarly talk about directors when i review a film but i believe this director deserves some praise from me. The director was Ang Lee he was outstanding he was. The way he cast the film , produced the film , and brought the charactors onto the big screen , were amazing he is now in my top five best directors list he is, i loved him, he is great !!! The visual effects of the film are top notch. As i said before all the animals look real even though they are not and the water and the ship sinking and the whale flying and the meer cats were so real i mean it was so good the animation was !!! The scenery was pretty awesome to like the island and india it was so cool to see it really was. All an All Life of Pi is an amazing award winner that is so Beautiful and all the Effert put into making this film makes this film an instant hit for people all over the world !!! A+ .

1486281,A1CYV655X6LBVK,B005LAIIHG,Kendrick,"[0, 4]","Life of Pi asks big questions but leaves audiences with few answers. This latest Ang Lee movie is an adaptation of the eponymous novel by Yann Martel, which already had a large readership before Lee announced the upcoming film release. Life of Pi tells the story of Piscine Molitor Patel who grows up in India, where his father owns a zoo. He changes his name to ""Pi"" to avoid jokes about his name's homophonic similarities to the slang word for urination. The story could be divided into three acts: 1) his years growing up in India, 2) the shipwreck and his life as a castaway, 3) his reflections on his experiences.The film begins with Pi speaking with a freelance writer. Pi's uncle told this writer that Pi had quite a story to tell and so the writer came to investigate. The film is Pi's narrative.Though growing up a Hindu, Pi explores Christianity and Islam and finds admirable things in all there. In one scene he is engaged in praying to Allah on a prayer mat; the next shows him crossing himself before he eats. This sequence of shots, with the adult Pi narrating his exploration of religion, confronts the audience immediately with an ""all paths lead to God"" form of spirituality that is reflective of the contemporary milieu and the philosophy of John Hick. At this point, Lee has given the film profound religious dimensions.Pi's father decides to move the family and bring the zoo animals along to sell in North America. On their way, a storm hits the cargo ship and Pi ends up being the sole survivor after being lowered in a lifeboat. The lifeboat also holds a hyena, an orangutan, a wounded Zebra, and a Bengal tiger named ""Richard Parker."" The hyena ends up eating the zebra alive, followed by killing the orangutan, only to be eaten by Richard Parker. Pi ends up fishing to feed the tiger so that he won't decide to eat Pi. They end up coming to an island, which they then leave after discovering that its ecosystem was carnivorous. The lifeboat ends up being washed ashore on the Mexican coast.After they reach land, Richard Parker journeys into the jungle and leaves no trace behind. Representatives of the cargo ship owners visit Pi in the hospital to learn why the ship sank, but instead get Pi's extraordinary story of survival. They refuse to believe it, so Pi tells a metaphorical story whereby the Zebra is a wounded sailor, the orangutan is his mother, the hyena is the ship's callous cook, and Richard Parker is Pi himself.Pi asks the writer which version of the saga he prefers. The animal version, he replies. Pi gives him the report filed by the ship company representatives, which reads that Pi held the record for shipwreck survivor longest at sea, and simply notes that he was accompanied by a Bengal tiger. We are left to interpret that comment ourselves. Does this last note demonstrate that there was evidence of a Bengal tiger on the ship and hence lends credence to Pi's story? Or does it merely indicate that the company representatives preferred the fantastical version?Somehow the audience is expected to come full circle--the beginning of the film asks questions about God's existence and the human spiritual experience and the movie ends with Pi uttering cryptic lines that are supposed to have answered these questions. I left the theater rather unsatisfied, not because there were no answers, but because Lee failed to even provide the connection between the three parts of the film. We moved from big questions in the first part to an end that jumped to a vague interpretation of the castaway experience.The clear import of the closing scene is that we can choose to view reality as mundane and material, or we can see it in all its manifold beauty that whispers the existence of God as corroborated by mindboggling providence. There is something inherent in us that wants to believe the latter and, lucky for us, the latter is true. If anything, Life of Pi is an argument for the existence of God based on the experience of beauty--whether it is physical beauty (the trailer shows jaw-dropping scenes of splendor that do not disappoint) or the beauty of storytelling.Life of Pi oddly lacks a theodicy. It doesn't address the pain of why Pi's parents had to die and why there's a Darwinian food chain in the lifeboat. The story might be trying to go one-step more and relegate these painful episodes to being part of the conflict--a necessary component to any good story. And that's what we're wrapped up in: the story of the universal soul. This is intellectually rooted in Hindu-Buddhistic views of cyclical history that can celebrate such a story of suffering without demanding justice from a higher power.To sum it up, the appetizer in the beginning and the dessert at the end tasted good, but the main course seemed completely unrelated to either. The whole time spent eating the main course was similar to an idyllic and eye-popping version of Tom Hanks's Castaway that singularly focused on survival. I have not read the book, so I'm not sure if Martel does a better job with this, but Lee's adaptation left something to be desired.[This review was published previously on Schaeffer's Ghost

Yet this movie is really about his journey in spirit. After having to leave India with his family, the boy becomes the lone human survivor after the cargo ship they were taking passage to North America is scuttled in a typhoon off the Philippines. In India they had been the operators of a small zoo. Some of their animals made the trip and 3 in particular survived the initial shipwreck. Some of the spiritual dynamics introduced including Krishna are brought out as Pi learns to deal with his ferocious companion, a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker and as the days lengthen to months at sea with little hope of survival we see how he envisions the world of the sea in fantastic luminous images. He first lands on a strange island which is hospitable by day and hostile by night by virtue of pure waters turning acidic by night. Later he washes up in Mexico where his longtime companion tiger just calmly walks into the forest without a look back. This upsets him and then a strange twist occurs when he is asked by Japanese authorities to account for his being the only survivor of the wrecking of their cargo ship. His story is too fantastic for them so he tells them another one which is more sinister yet more plausible. The allegory is caught by his listener as he retells the story many years later. The spiritual lesson is what do you wish to believe, the boy floating across the Pacific with a tiger or a boy who escaped evil doers.",5,A spectacle of a boy's journey,1363478400,"03 17, 2013",2013,1561,"['stunning', 'visual', 'images', 'adrift', 'sea', 'section', 'movie', 'viewer', 'might', 'despair', 'Pi', 'fate', 'movie', 'really', 'journey', 'spirit', 'having', 'leave', 'India', 'family', 'boy', 'lone', 'human', 'survivor', 'cargo', 'ship', 'were', 'taking', 'passage', 'North', 'America', 'scuttled', 'typhoon', 'Philippines', 'India', 'had', 'been', 'operators', 'small', 'zoo', 'animals', 'made', 'trip', '3', 'particular', 'survived', 'initial', 'shipwreck', 'spiritual', 'dynamics', 'introduced', 'including', 'Krishna', 'are', 'brought', 'out', 'Pi', 'deal', 'ferocious', 'companion', 'Bengal', 'tiger', 'named', 'Richard', 'Parker', 'days', 'lengthen', 'months', 'sea', 'little', 'hope', 'survival', 'see', 'how', 'world', 'sea', 'fantastic', 'luminous', 'images', 'first', 'strange', 'island', 'hospitable', 'day', 'hostile', 'night', 'virtue', 'pure', 'waters', 'turning', 'acidic', 'night', 'Later', 'up', 'Mexico', 'where', 'longtime', 'companion', 'tiger', 'just', 'calmly', 'forest', 'look', 'back', 'then', 'strange', 'twist', 'when', 'asked', 'Japanese', 'authorities', 'account', 'being', 'only', 'survivor', 'wrecking', 'cargo', 'ship', 'story', 'too', 'fantastic', 'so', 'one', 'more', 'sinister', 'yet', 'more', 'plausible', 'allegory', 'caught', 'listener', 'story', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'spiritual', 'lesson', 'what', 'do', 'wish', 'believe', 'boy', 'floating', 'Pacific', 'tiger', 'boy', 'who', 'escaped', 'evil', 'doers']",N/A

Most of all, it is about a young Hindu boy's spiritual journey, and for me the main theme is how he grew to give complete surrender to God for control of his present and future. There is a wonderful balance of humour with the tragedy and suspense in the film. The joke about his name is slightly vulgar, but funny all the same, and so typical of some little boys. I totally understand some people's concerns about the different religions mentioned, and there is a slight leaning toward the idea that all religions are equal. However, as his father says in the movie--you have to choose one road and to choose all of them is to have nothing!There are many Christian references contained in the film. These include Pi saying that he found Christ, the priest quotes John 3:16, Pi is shown praying and seems to pray to accept Christ, he says grace before every meal and says amen, mention is made of Jesus' Sacrifice and how He died for the sins of many when He had not sinned, the fact that he refers to himself as Catholic first, and his request to be baptized. The way I take it is that he still has his East Indian culture, but identifies himself as a Christian.It's a movie that can be appreciated on many different levels, and there is symbolism in the story, if you choose to see it. I wish I could get some other people's feelings on the symbolism of the tiger. To me he was representative of the boy's family with whom he was on a life journey, but they didn't get to say goodbye and to say thank you for all they had meant to each other. The tiger gave him life in many ways, and so did his family.As you're probably gathering, this movie can be taken in many different ways. This is not a movie for young children due to the graphic nature of the ship wreck, some of the animal deaths, and how scary it is in some places because of the tiger living with him on the boat in the middle of the ocean. Also, take your motion sickness pills before going. After about an hour on the sea, I really started to feel it, ha ha. The 3D effects and cinematography are really quite stunning and if this movie doesn't win some Oscars I will be very much surprised.I cannot say enough about the performance of Suraj Sharma who gave a brilliant acting performance. He is so believable as Pi and with this being his first film, I'd say he is a natural actor. Pi's romance is absolutely adorable as well.  As a Canadian I loved the Canadian reference to Winnipeg.

I knew Life of Pi had won awards but I needed to read reviews before deciding whether to watch it. I read the reviews on Amazon before watching this movie. In fact I usually come to Amazon before making a final decision on a film. The part that baffles me is the negative reviews of this film. I don't understand why anyone would have compared this to Avatar or why anyone after watching the entire film would bother bringing Avatar up. The only reason I can fathom as to why anyone would dislike this movie is if they didn't understand it. And that in itself baffles me too. Visually, this movie was stunning. Period. The cinematography and effects were gorgeous. Gorgeous not like Avatar...gorgeous like Life of Pi. The two are two very very different types of movie. But by the end of this movie I knew that it was not just a film for entertainment sake or about visual effects. It was human, raw, and frankly the story isn't about the tiger, it's about the boy who survived. The story is his. No matter what the real ending is, matters not. What matters is that we as humans face sometimes the most unfathomable trials and challenges and how we handle them is entirely up to us. When I finished watching this and I was done wiping my tears away, I knew I wanted to see it again. Somehow I felt like the lessons in the story weren't all going to be caught on the first try. It is worth watching again for the parts I may have missed. I was in awe of the cast and how effortlessly they played their parts. There were times when I laughed, times when I cried, times when I cringed and that is what a movie experience is supposed to be. No, that is what story telling is supposed to be. This film most definitely deserved academy awards. And I'll end this review...this very simplistic review with saying that I feel sorry for those that hated this movie. They missed out on the powerful message and the beautiful story. I can only be glad for myself that I got to experience Pi's story.

Like Shawshank Redemption, the protagonist undergoes physical, mental, and emotional damage that will either kill him or make him stronger although transformed. Like Titanic, a ship goes down and carries away family, safety, and security upon its descent. Like Lifeboat, an unusual mix of characters share tight, claustrophobic, treacherous quarters in a bid to survive at sea. Life of Pi is a beautiful story well-matched with breathtaking cinematography, visual effects, and sound design. Based upon the strength of these separate elements operating together in excellence, Ang Lee won Best Director.Truly fantastic is the powerful allegorical revelation of God in science based upon two interpretations of horrific, life-changing tragedies in the world of the protagonist a teenage boy. A storm at sea throws Pi either into the hands of God, or Mother Nature, or as Pi would have it--both. Driven to his physical, mental, and emotional limits while adrift for 227 days in the Pacific Ocean, Pi addresses the strains on his capacities by adapting to his horrific reality via spiritual, religious, scientific means, or perhaps cognitive dissonance.Some may view Pi's interpretations of his reality as opposite and therefore impossible. Others may view Pi's interpretations as complementary, and entirely reasonable. One step further and the viewer may even choose to accept the concept of God as the creator of all science and all scientific laws, God as the creator of evolution. Two steps further and the viewer may understand that logic and reason remain entirely compatible with religion and spiritualism. After two viewings, the only surprise that remains with Life of Pi is that it did not win the award for adapted screenplay.",5,"If The Shawshank Redemption, Titanic, and Lifeboat moved you...",1370131200,"06 2, 2013",2013,1960,"['Frank', 'Darabont', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'James', 'Cameron', 'Titanic', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Lifeboat', 'made', 'believe', 'power', 'story', 'then', 'so', 'shall', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'Life', 'Pi', 'way', 'Yann', 'Martel', 'book', 'same', 'title', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'protagonist', 'undergoes', 'physical', 'mental', 'emotional', 'damage', 'will', 'either', 'kill', 'make', 'stronger', 'transformed', 'Titanic', 'ship', 'down', 'away', 'family', 'safety', 'security', 'descent', 'Lifeboat', 'unusual', 'mix', 'characters', 'share', 'tight', 'claustrophobic', 'treacherous', 'quarters', 'bid', 'survive', 'sea', 'Life', 'Pi', 'beautiful', 'story', 'well-matched', 'breathtaking', 'cinematography', 'visual', 'effects', 'sound', 'design', 'Based', 'strength', 'separate', 'elements', 'operating', 'together', 'excellence', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'won', 'Best', 'Director.Truly', 'fantastic', 'powerful', 'allegorical', 'revelation', 'God', 'science', 'based', 'two', 'interpretations', 'horrific', 'life-changing', 'tragedies', 'world', 'protagonist', 'teenage', 'boy', 'storm', 'sea', 'throws', 'Pi', 'hands', 'God', 'Mother', 'Nature', 'Pi', 'would', 'have', 'Driven', 'physical', 'mental', 'emotional', 'limits', 'adrift', '227', 'days', 'Pacific', 'Ocean', 'Pi', 'strains', 'capacities', 'adapting', 'horrific', 'reality', 'spiritual', 'religious', 'scientific', 'perhaps', 'cognitive', 'dissonance.Some', 'may', 'view', 'Pi', 'interpretations', 'reality', 'opposite', 'therefore', 'impossible', 'Others', 'may', 'view', 'Pi', 'interpretations', 'complementary', 'entirely', 'reasonable', 'One', 'step', 'further', 'viewer', 'may', 'even', 'choose', 'accept', 'concept', 'God', 'creator', 'science', 'scientific', 'laws', 'God', 'creator', 'evolution', 'Two', 'steps', 'further', 'viewer', 'may', 'understand', 'logic', 'reason', 'remain', 'entirely', 'compatible', 'religion', 'spiritualism', 'two', 'viewings', 'only', 'surprise', 'Life', 'Pi', 'did', 'not', 'win', 'award', 'adapted', 'screenplay']",N/A

A friend of mine had encouraged me to see this movie, and rather gushed over it.  ""It was so amazing"", she said.The strange thing about this movie is it really resembledThe Tree Of LifeandThe Fountain. Although The Life Of Pi definitely had a more developed story than the other two.I won't go into too much detail, I will however give my customary parent of children warning:  The movie plays on Pi's name where they change it to ""P!ssing"".  And they say ""P!ssing"" over and over.  Over twenty times.  They just won't let it die.  Kids, adults, narrator, everyone is saying it.  Its not that funny and the thick Indian/Hindu dialect makes it so hard to even understand the joke, all you hear is ""P!ssing""!Then there is the scene where Pi is standing with his back to the camera and you see him urinating on the tarp of the boat.  The animated lion then turns his rear to Pi and sprays Pi in the face with urine. Necessary to the movie? No. Big movie execs thinking the adults will love it? Yes.And that's the end of my parents with children warning.  Unless of course you want me to cover the many animals that are attacked and die.  But I am sure others have warned you of that.I believe the story could have been more believable, understanding, or even more enjoyable had they not had the weirdness intermingled in it.  You never know if the story is real or if he is hallucinating.  Even at the end when he is explaining to the investigators what really happened on the ship, he tells two different stories.  Supposedly one is true, but they are both so far out you really don't know which one is true at all.The human acting was pretty good, however the animation of all of the animals really took away from the story rather than enhance it.Overall, I would never recommend this movie to anyone. Friend or enemy. I struggle with giving it one star even, but since it wasn't near as bad as The Tree of Life I am going to up it a star.

The young Pi had a horrible, traumatic experience that he could not (or did not WANT to) remember.  He had to assist in the operation of a sailor with an infected leg, saw the dead sailor being used as bait for food, saw his mother die, saw his mother eaten by sharks, and, then, had to kill a man (the cook) himself.  Who would not want to create an alternative story--one in which God intervenes to make things more bearable?And, yet, at the end Pi asked people to choose which story they prefered.  This is tantamount to asking someone if they want to believe in reality, which can be cruel, or believe in God, which can be comforting.  That is what this entire movie is about!

Such joy of living at the mercy of beautiful, vast, deadly ocean on the big screen was minimized or undermined by the trivial dialogue between a writer and a story teller trying to explain how he got his name PI, how the ship sank, or how the Japanese investigators were puzzled by his narration.Even though the movie lasted over 2 hours, in 3D, the portion of the teller and the writer about the youth of the teller in India and his family affairs after his survival were boring, immaterial, and spoiled the great and exotic events of surviving on a boat with a hungry untamed tiger.There were plenty of scenes that should have been added to the transport of animals from India to the Japanese ship shat could have made the movie a marvelous piece of art and which were omitted by the moviemaker. Instead, trivial kitchen table discussions killed the joy of fighting the elements of merciless ocean.Very intense and long moments of rough waves, winds, and water sunk a ship loaded with people, animals, and great hope for better life crashed with the sinking ship. That was followed by many marvelous events of flying fish, whale attack causing gigantic shock waves in water, highways of playful dolphins, and exotic island, rich with animals, vegetation, and peculiar chemistry.The greatest cinematic play were vividly demonstrated in many chapters. A hungry vicious hyena victimizes a zebra and orangutan,never rests until attacked by a Bengali tiger. The actions of the three animals was truly impressive, appearing very real. The tiger performed magnificent job of high precision, pride, and immensely powerful motion, in health and sickness.The movie is a must see.Mohamed F.

The movie begins with an adult Piscine (Pi) Patel (Irfan Khan) relating a potential story for a book to be written by a friend of a friend (Rafe Spall).He tells of him and his family leaving India and their zoo for Canada to start over.  They have crated up numerous animals for the long voyage on a Japanese cargo ship.  During a violent storm the ship sinks, but through some fortune, Pi (Suraj Sharma) has managed to land on a life boat along with an injured zebra, a disoriented Orangutan and an ornery Hyena.  Oh, and the tiger.Now before you think this is one of those can't-we-all-just-get-along Disney movies - after all it is rated PG - forget about it.  One of the points driven home in the film is that these are animals and in fact, they do what animals do.  You get the picture.  Pi, realizing he isn't dealing with dogs and cats, uses the human brain and creates a makeshift raft which is tethered to the boat.  At certain times he is able to return to the boat for supplies and to check on the surviving tiger.Their confrontations are certainly the meat of the film, but that really isn't enough.  I saw this in 3-D and it is certainly the best use of the technology since ""Avatar.""  Directed by Ang Lee, the use is never in-your-face trickery, but is created on film as a new, dare I say art form?  While this film may not be life changing, it is beautifully made, creative and wondrous.  There are enough questions to keep the mind busy for days to come.  Lee and screenwriter David Magee masterfully adapt Yann Martel's novel.  And just when you are trying to soak it all it, an alternate version of the story gets the mind reeling.BLU RAY UPDATE (5-2-13):This Oscar winner, including director Ang Lee, begged to be seen again.  It ranked as my 10th favorite film from last year and would likely move up if I would have a do over.  This time I saw it in 2-D and it holds up nearly as well as it did on the big screen in 3-D.  While there is no understating the technical achievement of the film, it is also filled with wonderful emotional moments and big chunks of humor.For example, early in the story Pi relates how he became so interested in various religions.  He was a practicing Hindu as well as Christian and Muslim as a young teen.  Surprisingly this didn't seem to bother his parents.  In one exchange at the dinner table his father, Santosh (Adil Hussain), comments, ""3 more religions and you'll spend your whole life on holiday."" He then adds, ""Think rationally.""  The relationship Pi had with his father, including the respect for wild animals, is an important point in the story.The Blu ray transfer has an aspect ratio of 1.85:1, with a couple exceptions, and has a 1080p resolution.  As you might expect there are virtually no blips in the carryover that I could see.  This is a colorful movie and all the hues and shadings come across perfectly.  The film was digitally shot and is crystal clear.  Chapped lips and sunburned tiger nose are easily seen.  There is a couple format changes to note.  In one scene with the flying fish, the aspect ratio changes to a wider 2.35:1.  In another, a shot from overhead as a whale glides by the boat is shown in windowbox (1.33:1?).  These are brief scenes and while noticeable, they are not distracting.The audio is demo quality with a DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 track on full display.  There are scenes of quiet beauty (great musical score) and others of thunderous activity from all speakers.  An example is the violent ship sinking scene.  For some great sound effects, check out the tiger claws as he makes his way around and later into the boat.  This is a magnificent film paired with a superb transfer.  There are 3 documentaries involving the movie production as well as a photo gallery and some storyboards included in the extras.",5,BLU RAY UPDATE:  Glorious movie making,1353888000,"11 26, 2012",2012,3977,"['Supposedly', 'un-filmable', 'fantastical', 'tale', 'teenager', 'India', 'surviving', 'sea', 'weeks', 'alone', 'Bengal', 'tiger', 'remarkable', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'movie', 'adult', 'Piscine', 'Pi', 'Patel', 'Irfan', 'Khan', 'relating', 'potential', 'story', 'book', 'be', 'written', 'friend', 'friend', 'Rafe', 'Spall', '.He', 'tells', 'family', 'leaving', 'India', 'zoo', 'Canada', 'start', 'over', 'have', 'crated', 'up', 'numerous', 'animals', 'long', 'voyage', 'Japanese', 'cargo', 'ship', 'violent', 'storm', 'ship', 'sinks', 'fortune', 'Pi', 'Suraj', 'Sharma', 'managed', 'land', 'life', 'boat', 'injured', 'zebra', 'disoriented', 'Orangutan', 'ornery', 'Hyena', 'Oh', 'tiger.Now', 'think', 'one', ""can't-we-all-just-get-along"", 'Disney', 'movies', 'rated', 'PG', 'forget', 'One', 'points', 'driven', 'home', 'film', 'are', 'animals', 'fact', 'do', 'what', 'animals', 'do', 'get', 'picture', 'Pi', 'realizing', ""n't"", 'dealing', 'dogs', 'cats', 'human', 'brain', 'makeshift', 'raft', 'tethered', 'boat', 'certain', 'times', 'able', 'return', 'boat', 'supplies', 'check', 'surviving', 'tiger.Their', 'confrontations', 'are', 'certainly', 'meat', 'film', 'really', ""n't"", 'enough', 'saw', '3-D', 'certainly', 'best', 'use', 'technology', 'Avatar', 'Directed', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'use', 'never', 'in-your-face', 'trickery', 'created', 'film', 'new', 'dare', 'say', 'art', 'form', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'life', 'changing', 'beautifully', 'made', 'creative', 'wondrous', 'are', 'enough', 'questions', 'keep', 'mind', 'busy', 'days', 'come', 'Lee', 'screenwriter', 'David', 'Magee', 'masterfully', 'Yann', 'Martel', 'novel', 'just', 'when', 'are', 'trying', 'soak', 'alternate', 'version', 'story', 'mind', 'reeling.BLU', 'RAY', 'UPDATE', '5-2-13', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'including', 'director', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'begged', 'be', 'seen', 'again', 'ranked', '10th', 'favorite', 'film', 'last', 'year', 'would', 'likely', 'move', 'up', 'would', 'have', 'do', 'over', 'time', 'saw', '2-D', 'up', 'nearly', 'as', 'well', 'did', 'big', 'screen', '3-D', 'understating', 'technical', 'achievement', 'film', 'also', 'filled', 'wonderful', 'emotional', 'moments', 'big', 'chunks', 'humor.For', 'example', 'early', 'story', 'Pi', 'how', 'became', 'so', 'interested', 'various', 'religions', 'was', 'practicing', 'Hindu', 'as', 'well', 'Christian', 'Muslim', 'young', 'teen', 'Surprisingly', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'bother', 'parents', 'one', 'exchange', 'dinner', 'table', 'father', 'Santosh', 'Adil', 'Hussain', 'comments', '3', 'more', 'religions', ""'ll"", 'spend', 'whole', 'life', 'holiday', 'then', 'Think', 'rationally', 'relationship', 'Pi', 'had', 'father', 'including', 'respect', 'wild', 'animals', 'important', 'point', 'story.The', 'Blu', 'ray', 'transfer', 'aspect', 'ratio', '1.85:1', 'couple', 'exceptions', '1080p', 'resolution', 'might', 'expect', 'are', 'virtually', 'blips', 'carryover', 'could', 'see', 'colorful', 'movie', 'hues', 'shadings', 'come', 'perfectly', 'film', 'was', 'digitally', 'shot', 'crystal', 'clear', 'Chapped', 'lips', 'sunburned', 'tiger', 'nose', 'are', 'easily', 'seen', 'couple', 'format', 'changes', 'note', 'one', 'scene', 'flying', 'fish', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'changes', 'wider', '2.35:1', 'shot', 'overhead', 'whale', 'glides', 'boat', 'shown', 'windowbox', '1.33:1', 'are', 'brief', 'scenes', 'noticeable', 'are', 'not', 'distracting.The', 'audio', 'demo', 'quality', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '7.1', 'track', 'full', 'display', 'are', 'scenes', 'quiet', 'beauty', 'great', 'musical', 'score', 'others', 'thunderous', 'activity', 'speakers', 'example', 'violent', 'ship', 'sinking', 'scene', 'great', 'sound', 'effects', 'check', 'out', 'tiger', 'claws', 'way', 'around', 'later', 'boat', 'magnificent', 'film', 'paired', 'superb', 'transfer', 'are', '3', 'documentaries', 'involving', 'movie', 'production', 'as', 'well', 'photo', 'gallery', 'storyboards', 'included', 'extras']",N/A

Most stories/movies could not have pulled that off.  There were a couple of scenes where I thought &#34;not in a million years would that happen&#34; but it wasn't so bad to detract from the movie.  That and it gives off that &#34;Disney, creative imagination&#34; vibe so you let it slide. The whole relationship he forms with the tiger is actually really well done and you feel like the tiger has a personality which lends weight to some of the scenes.Obviously the ending, when you find out everything may not be as it appears, is a solid twist, but in my opinion I feel like it kills the movie.  I understand the point the author wishes to convey (interpreting the story however you want) but this story was fun and magical and they could've went about the ending a little bit differently, even if they had to deviate from the book.  I know this would kill the spirit of the book/movie, and you have to take these things as they are, which is why I rounded-up and not down.  But I stand by this statement.  Being a realistic person, I know what the truth is, which means the movie/story/tiger is fake, and that sucks.  And yes: &#34;reality does suck sometimes&#34; but if I want a dose of this type of reality, I'll go watch Lincoln or Rust and Bone, not a magical, fun adventure like this.All-in-all though, a good movie worth a rental.

I don't know how the book is since I've never read it but the film didn't seem to have a story and characters that are very compelling. Ang Lee and his screenwriter needs to receive some credit in turning this tale into a feature movie, however. A story about a boy on a boat with a tiger where nothing much really happens except basic survival is difficult to shoot but Lee seemed to do as nice a job as it is possible given that challenge. Seeing the 3D version of the film may be the only redeeming feature of the movie. The 3d adds a depth not only to the images but to the story telling as well. Its use to convey depth in space is incorporated nicely by Lee into giving sense of loss and loneliness the boy feels in the ocean with all these non human animals in the boat and in vast the ocean.

Life of Pi is this and many other things, sweeping the viewer away into a mesmerizing place that blurs the lines between dream and what is real.Ang Lee directs the previously thought un-filmable book to the big screen, Life of Pi. How it comes to life is breathtaking; an ingeniously woven tapestry of incredible visual elements and powerfully adept storytelling, all to the affect of discovering the greater meaning of being alive in a situation you would rather die in.It's an art movie that many audiences will love simply because of the gorgeous visuals, memorable character(s), and incredible spectacle. But for those looking for a deeper, meaty, and memorable movie going experience Life of Pi has you covered. No other movie nominated for best picture at the 2013 Oscars has perplexed me, moved me, made me reflect and think, and swept me away within its lush, visual imagery and unique storytelling. It's a film chock full of metaphor, visual imagery, and raw emotion. But this isn't a discussion of the film's many layers of religious undertones and imagery, but a review. I'll keep it that way!First off is director Ang Lee's incredible talent on display (for which he won Best Director - 2013). I have yet to read Life of Pi but from what I've heard from friends and book junkies is that Life of Pi is an incredibly complex, almost muddy in direction, novel which many considered un-filmable. What becomes of this epic tale of survival is a clean and expertly directed film, with all of its themes and underlying tones hidden within the visual landscape and story. It's not a force-fed experience, but rather one where you must process the vast array of information and make your own judgment on some of its less touched-on ideas. Whatever creative process Mr. Lee went through to bring this incredibly complex adventure to life is beyond me, and that's a true testament of the genius on display.You can't talk about Life of Pi without discussing the incredible visuals. Winning both Best Cinematography (2013) and Best Special Effects (2013) at the 2013 Academy Awards, I had high expectations going into Life of Pi. The film starts off, simply put, like any other PG-rated family film. I was nervous that it was going to be a bust. Where the film takes the viewer is someplace completely unique and unexpected. Without spoiling some of the finer moments, Life of Pi has visual panache to spare. There are some incredible moments that are rendered and recreated with such life-like detail that getting lost in Pi's tale is tremendously easy. Its visuals dazzle, but don't distract its storytelling, unlike other films (namely Avatar, which is a visual marvel but hardly a groundbreaking example of storytelling). One of the main strengths in Life of Pi is Richard Parker, the Bengal tiger that accompanies Pi during his quest. Little did I know that that 90 percent of his screen-time is completely computer animated. And it's not just that, but the rest of the film; the water effects, the tumbling ship, various animals; all of it is incredible. It maintains a perfect balance of realism and a dream-like quality. Some of the scenes are also shot with incredible vision and beauty. It's simply the most beautiful cinematography of any film last year (other than the Hobbit). I have nothing but praise for Life of Pi's cinematographer and special effects team.But no story is worth being told without great characters and actors to tell them. Life of Pi's Suraj Sharma (Pi) is absolutely fantastic. Emotional, powerful, and sincere; he is one seriously talented actor for never having been in a role before...ever. While the beginning of the film features a quick romance between Pi and Gita, featuring its fair share of awkward exchanges, its nothing annoying. Pi and his incredible story is what you see 90 percent of the time. It's his story of finding faith in the darkest of times, discovering courage where none should be present, and having the will to continue to live. The rest of the supporting cast does just fine in their various roles, aiding along the telling of a most grandiose adventure.Everything else is spectacular as well. The original score (also winning the Oscar for Best Score - 2013) fits the pages of Pi's story like clockwork. From the moving ""Pi's Lullaby"" to the gorgeous and ethereal ""First Night, First Day"", the original score never distracts but rather augments the experience, creating some of the most beautiful audio-visual-scapes in any film from recent memory. Sound editing is particularly fantastic. Crashing waves, minute sound effects; it's all done particularly well, especially in its transition to home video (aside from a couple of weird boom adjustments made mid scene that distract the acute ear). And boy, I can only imagine the splendor of the 3D this film had to offer but I, regretfully, was not able to see it in theaters, only on Blu-Ray. The one issue I had with the visual presentation was this, also noticed by Blu-Ray.com: ""There are two spots in the film where the aspect ratio changes suddenly from the normal 1.85:1. During the ""flying fish"" sequence that was used as a teaser for the movie, the top and bottom close in to 2.35:1, and there's a single overhead shot of a whale passing beneath the lifeboat that inexplicably squeezes in to a window-boxed 1.33:1. I'm not sure what the rationale or workflow was here, so I can't really comment on it, but don't be alarmed by the out-of-nowhere framing changes."" In layman's terms, the film goes from a whole-screen experience to having the black bars on the top and bottom and sides during two scenes, which is fairly distracting.Where Pi finishes his journey is up to you to discover and interpret. Where it stands for me, personally, is my favorite film of 2012. Visually spectacular, incredibly engaging, intricately told, and masterfully directed, Life of Pi was a massive gamble that pays off in more ways than one. It's an absolute classic.5/5 - Spectacular, Sensational; insert your own positive descriptor here and go see this movie!",5,A Masterpiece,1363305600,"03 15, 2013",2013,6160,"['Short', 'visual',

1486483,A1PTBXZG04GT29,B005LAIIHG,NewAgeMama,"[2, 3]","Life of Pi takes you on the amazing adventure. A young castaway is stranded on a life boat with a Bengal Tiger. The film starts out in  India where you learn a little bit about Pi's family and his quest for spirituality. I loved how he followed a variety of religions, embracing their similarities instead of focusing on their differences. This strong faith is what helped him to handle the trials that followed. His father decides his family must leave India behind, and they take the entire menagerie from their zoo along with them. When the boat sinks, Pi finds himself on an ark of sorts with a few captive animals.

1486484,AGB7UQZMVHNUJ,B005LAIIHG,"NewDiane ""I live to read!""","[2, 3]","I never read the book and didn't want to watch the movie, but saw it at a friend's house. Even though I didn't see it on the large screen or in 3D, it was mesmerizing. At first I was comfortably seated on a sofa, but midway through the film I found myself hunched forward, literally on the edge of my seat. By the end of the movie I was crying. That's how gripping the cinematography and special effects were, and to a certain extent the story itself. Although some people dislike the alternate ending, I found it wonderful. There are flaws, but the overall experience overcomes them. For example, in the first third of the tale, there is a fair amount of humor. The humor seems oddly out of place in the story as a whole and is soon dispensed with, never to return. There are some anomalies which are not explored, such as an instance where a goat on one side of a barred doorway is apparently taken through to the other side by a tiger. The tiger is a wonderful character and so realistically done that I thought a live animal was being used for much of the film until I learned otherwise. He has a name, Richard Parker, which seems to be an allusion to an actual person, but I don't want to spoil anything by explaining the reference. All the actors are quite good and manage to make you care for them, so when tragedy strikes, it really hits home. Apart from being trapped on a raft in the Pacific, water is a recurring theme, right down to Pi's real name...his full name is that of a French public swimming pool. The idea of rebirth is linked to that, and Pi's growth from introspective teen to self-sufficient man is a part of it. This is a dazzling and enchanting movie, and well worth watching.",4,The special effects are greater than the flaws,1377907200,"08 31, 2013",2013,1702,"['never', 'read', 'book', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'movie', 'saw', 'friend', 'house', 'Even', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'large', 'screen', '3D', 'was', 'mesmerizing', 'first', 'was', 'comfortably', 'seated', 'sofa', 'midway', 'film', 'found', 'hunched', 'forward', 'literally', 'edge', 'seat', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'crying', 'how', 'gripping', 'cinematography', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'certain', 'extent', 'story', 'people', 'dislike', 'alternate', 'ending', 'found', 'wonderful', 'are', 'flaws', 'overall', 'experience', 'example', 'first', 'third', 'tale', 'fair', 'amount', 'humor', 'humor', 'oddly', 'place', 'story', 'whole', 'soon', 'dispensed', 'never', 'return', 'are', 'anomalies', 'are', 'not', 'explored', 'such', 'instance', 'where', 'goat', 'one', 'side', 'barred', 'doorway', 'apparently', 'taken', 'other', 'side', 'tiger', 'tiger', 'wonderful', 'character', 'so', 'realistically', 'done', 'thought', 'live', 'animal', 'was', 'being', 'used', 'much', 'film', 'learned', 'otherwise', 'name', 'Richard', 'Parker', 'be', 'allusion', 'actual', 'person', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'anything', 'explaining', 'reference', 'actors', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'manage', 'make', 'care', 'so', 'when', 'tragedy', 'strikes', 'really', 'home', 'Apart', 'being', 'trapped', 'raft', 'Pacific', 'water', 'recurring', 'theme', 'right', 'down', 'Pi', 'real', 'name', 'full', 'name', 'French', 'public', 'swimming', 'pool', 'idea', 'rebirth', 'linked', 'Pi', 'growth', 'introspective', 'teen', 'self-sufficient', 'man', 'part', 'dazzling', 'enchanting', 'movie', 'well', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

Gregg,"[2, 3]","There are some subtitled parts in this movie, but these sections are brief and not a lot to read, so there shouldn't be too much groaning from those people who hate to have to read subtitles - hopefully knowing this going in will help you not mind so much.I watched this on my pc via Amazon instant video (not in blu-ray, 3D or even HD) - and I have to say the cinematography is really beautiful!  It is an interesting story - how could someone have thought this up, could this have really happened or is it all someone's imagination?  (It seems it was imagination.)The movie IS interesting, but as you might guess it would HAVE to be from the type of story it is, it sometimes feels long.  It does make you THINK now and then and so it stays with you, in your thoughts for a good time after the movie has ended.The different actors used to portray ""PI"" in various stages/ages of his life do not seem to look enough like each other to escape notice - but it's ok.  It doesn't seem to hurt the movie at all, just pointing out that we noticed so you probably will too.When PI is finally rescued, he is questioned about the loss of the ship (insurance, you know) - and they don't like his story (which you just watched, with the tiger and all) and so they ask him to come up with a more believable story.  When he relates the more believable version, he gets emotional and so you are left to wonder which is really true - and he asks which you prefer to be true.  Then the person PI is telling all this to notes correlation of the characters in each version, and I had to then replay the 2nd ""believable"" version for the insurance people to see that comparison for myself, so I was really glad I saw this on video and not live at the movies where I wouldn't have been able to do that.  ... it is an interesting little twist to the tale I think.It's a very CLEAN movie so good for the family (though kids have to deal with the subject of how vicious animals can be - which is a good lesson, but you want to be aware of that before a very young child sees this, so you're prepared), and PI is just a likable character - which is a MUST for a successful movie).I don't know if this is a movie I'd want to watch over and over - but it was one I did enjoy watching, and so I would recommend it to most viewers.

Yes, both involve a ship sinking with one human survivor, and both have the survivor interact with animals while waiting for rescue. There is a key difference, though, that expands drastically with the final minutes of the film. In ""The Black Stallion,"" the animal is a horse, something humans communicate with around the world. In Life of Pi, the tiger gives us something completely different. A natural enemy, very willing to devour. I'll get to the important meaning later.As is evident from the dramatic trailer, the cinematography is overwhelmingly beautiful. In all honesty, you don't see the half of it in the trailer. While at first, it didn't seem likely to work in 3D, I've put that view aside. It's the best live-action 3D I've ever seen! One of the best scenes (for the full emotional effect), is seeing the ship go down as if you were right there. In fact, more than one scene were so effective in this way that I was physically breathless. A few times during the film, Pi encounters rough storms, and this is where another beauty comes through. The camera captures the movement of Pi and his boat so well, it boggles me. While other movies have moved from cut to cut in moments, giving the impression of a storm, these cuts last much longer and show a lot more. It's as if filmed on location, with no misguiding.Something you should know before you watch is that Life of Pi breaks into the topic of religion quite a bit at the beginning. Pi follows several religions. First, Hindu, then Catholicism, and Muslim, all at once. After the incident, it doesn't come up much, apart from a few overtones, but it's important to be aware going in.This is a film for slightly older audiences (13+) for the reasons of the ship's intense sinking, and for the complicated concepts of the film.To warn you, this last paragraph is a bit *SPOILER* oriented. Near the end of the movie, Pi tells another story, showing what the tiger represents. Suffice it to say that there is more meaning to this than surviving on an island with a horse and winning a race with him later on. I won't spoil any more, though.In conclusion, this is a beautiful movie about survival and perseverance, in the midst of harsh, beautiful nature.",4,"Truly, a beautiful film",1353283200,"11 19, 2012",2012,2350,"['One', 'might', 'watch', 'trailer', 'groan', 'prospect', 'Black', 'Stallion', 'have', 'good', 'news', 'not', 'same', 'Yes', 'involve', 'ship', 'sinking', 'one', 'human', 'survivor', 'have', 'survivor', 'interact', 'animals', 'waiting', 'rescue', 'key', 'difference', 'though', 'drastically', 'final', 'minutes', 'film', 'Black', 'Stallion', 'animal', 'horse', 'something', 'humans', 'communicate', 'world', 'Life', 'Pi', 'tiger', 'something', 'completely', 'different', 'natural', 'enemy', 'very', 'willing', 'devour', ""'ll"", 'get', 'important', 'meaning', 'later.As', 'evident', 'dramatic', 'trailer', 'cinematography', 'overwhelmingly', 'beautiful', 'honesty', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'half', 'trailer', 'first', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'likely', 'work', '3D', ""'ve"", 'put', 'view', 'aside', 'best', 'live-action', '3D', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'One', 'best', 'scenes', 'full', 'emotional', 'effect', 'seeing', 'ship', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'were', 'right', 'there', 'fact', 'more', 'one', 'scene', 'were', 'so', 'effective', 'way', 'was', 'physically', 'breathless', 'few', 'times', 'film', 'Pi', 'rough', 'storms', 'where', 'beauty', 'camera', 'movement', 'Pi', 'boat', 'so', 'well', 'other', 'movies', 'have', 'moved', 'cut', 'cut', 'moments', 'giving', 'impression', 'storm', 'cuts', 'last', 'much', 'longer', 'show', 'lot', 'more', 'filmed', 'location', 'misguiding.Something', 'should', 'know', 'watch', 'Life', 'Pi', 'breaks', 'topic', 'religion', 'quite', 'bit', 'beginning', 'Pi', 'several', 'religions', 'First', 'Hindu', 'then', 'Catholicism', 'Muslim', 'once', 'incident', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'much', 'apart', 'few', 'overtones', 'important', 'be', 'aware', 'going', 'in.This', 'film', 'slightly', 'older', 'audiences', '13+', 'reasons', 'ship', 'intense', 'sinking', 'complicated', 'concepts', 'film.To', 'warn', 'last', 'paragraph', 'bit', '*SPOILER*', 'oriented', 'end', 'movie', 'Pi', 'story', 'showing', 'what', 'tiger', 'Suffice', 'say', 'more', 'meaning', 'surviving', 'island', 'horse', 'winning', 'race', 'later', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'more', 'though.In', 'conclusion', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'survival', 'perseverance', 'midst', 'harsh', 'beautiful', 'nature']",N/A

The trials following ""Pi"" Patel the youngest member of the Patel Family, zookeepers who have resolved to move from their native Pondicherry, in India, to Canada, is brought to screen with subtlety at so many levels that one cannot help but marvel at Lee's sense for storytelling, his eye for talent, and for his ability to bring to life the many emotional registers of this story of a resilient father lost to a son, and a son who in turn manages to bring that father's life lessons to bear on his quest to accomplish what is truly grand in life. Pi's rage to find a response to the final questions he has on God, the meaning of life, and the vast array of philosophies that merges and emerges growing up in the heart of the great tropics - India - is the grandest example of a cinematic ""trip"" we have had all year.The scenes with ""Pi"" telling his story in flashback, of his quest for religious unity in a world where Gods and Dieties abound and haunt his imagination, his conversations with books late into the night, along with altercations and loving interludes with his close and inseparable family is contrasted with the uncompromising self-reliant individualism that Pi is subjected to in that fateful journey across the seas. The long migration to Canada initially seems like a fool's quest but the deeper emotional notes in Pi's odyssey across the seas has an empowering tragic sense of life that has no equal this year at the movies.Ang Lee stretches his own range of interests in his quest for a deeper emotional connection with religious themes in Martel's novels. Pi's lone quest in a raft, struggling to come to terms with his demons, in the open sea, also opens up a range of interpretations. Depending on your interpretive mood and fancy, Pi's altercations with a Tiger, Orangutan, and Zebra, could be taken as real or figurative/hallucinatory encounters.The sheer beauty and detail of the digital imagery that unfolds on screen, the breathtaking vision of young Pi lost in the ocean is, in and of itself, only spectacle. But these visuals, become a beautiful, even consoling, vision of a human being absorbed in his infinite struggles and longings. The brilliant decorative pieces on the cinematic canvas become vast signifiers of life's deepest meanings. And none of this gets ponderous, or pretentious. This is a tale told simply, furiously, of Pi's resolve, of his sadness, love, loss, and protests. Pi's scream in a crucial hallucinatory moment, when he is numbed by thirst, hunger, and exhaustion, and face to face with his father, his mother, his brother, lying deep in the ocean, in a cry of protest, is the best single scene at the movies this year. His protest transcends the infinite stretches of the skies and the ocean above and below him.  Lee's attention to Pi's anguish, this moral epicenter of this grand visual spectacle, is a moment on screen that reminded me, again, of the aesthetic power of cinema. Great directors do this constantly and Ang Lee manages to bring these moments to the screen this year more than any other film I have seen. A young man striving to remain true to his calling, as a son, an orphan, and finally a representative human being striving beyond his native strength, is a great moment of cinema, where tragedy and triumph meet without separation.Lee shows how he has developed mastery over stories that have incredible reserves of human emotion when it is handled with deftness. Lee knows when to let the narrative drift in the high seas of this drama and he also knows when to build and unleash those transcendent moments in his careful staging of the characters and scenes, in some truly unforgettable flights of cinematic artistry. This is an old fashioned story, in turns allegorical and deeply human, that relies on Lee's control, his unerring sense of timing and quiet artistry, his impeccable awareness of how to control the tension in the drama during its ebbs and flows.This story of Pi Patel and his family is perhaps Ang Lee's best film since ""Sense and Sensibility"" and his underestimated Hulk (2003) and is also my pick for the best movie of the year.Lee is at the peak of his powers, doing what he does best, in his third decade as a major director, with his delicate perceptive powers coming into its own in its fullest expression. ""Life of Pi"" is literary material with a moral theme that can turn stiff, dull, and pretentious in less able directorial hands. But Ang Lee manages to keep his explorations of the triumph and tragedy of life on screen well within the bounds of taste to make Pi's unraveling tragic story a redeeming one. What is on display here is the simple miracle of family life, its redeeming power, despite the tensions and tragedies that abound on the surface.",5,A Taste of Pi,1361145600,"02 18,

1486518,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B005LAIIHG,Paul Allaer,"[7, 10]","""Life of Pi"" (2012 release; 126 min.) brings the story of an Indian boy, named Piscine Patel, nicknamed Pi, as he grows up with his family on a zoo in India. Because of falling fortunes, Pi's dad decides to move the family to Canada, taking the animals of the zoo with them on their cross-Pacific Ocean journey with the idea to sell the animals upon arrival. Then disaster strikes as the ship meets a mega-storm and sinks. Pi manages to get on a life-saver boat, only to find that several animals made it onto the boat as well, a hyena, a zebra, an orangutan and a bengal tiger. To tell you more of what happens after that would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to find out and experience it for yourself.Several comments: the movie truly kicks into gear about 30 min. into it when the storm hits the ship transporting the family and the animals, with astounding visuals. The next hour of the movie finds Pi adrift on the Pacific Ocean with the several animals that somehow got onto the life-boat. At that point it reminded me of the Tom Hanks movie ""Castaway"" some years ago, albeit with one big exception: the visuals of the movie, in particularly when watching it in 3D as I did in the theatre today, are simply amazing. Eye-candy pure and simple. These days, 3D movies are rarely worth the bother, but this one is the beautiful exception, perhaps the best use of 3D since ""Avatar"".A shout-out to Suraj Sharma as the 16 yr. old Pi, who brings an outstanding performance, in particular since the many scenes he does with the bengal tiger, who is entirely CGI (although amazingly and incredibly looking real life). Also a special note to also to Mychael Danna who scored the beautiful soundtrack for the movie (it is available on CD). In all, I thorougly enjoyed this movie from start to finish. I was amazed how quickly it rolled by. ""Life of Pi"" is one of those movies that needs to be seen on the big screen, and in 3D at that. ""Life of Pi"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",4,4.5 stars...

It is the story,acting and directing that counts. Ang Lee is a briliant director and does  do a fantastic  job  with this film.  However there were  too many  religious overtones - okay if you  like that sort of thing. It took 20 minutes before  anything started to  get you involved in the  film. A much shorter opening  would have been better.What puzzled me was that we see three dead animals in the boat but a  few minutes later they have dissappeared. Where did they go? If they were eaten by the tiger  then where were the  bones  etc? The trailer for the film ,gave  away  far too much of the story especially after  leaving the boat on the  island.That ruined any suspense that the  film  should have had.The story  was  far fetched  as it would be  extremely  difficult for such an event to occur in real life.It was more like an episode of LOST.

1486557,A2DLKD4AC5JV5Q,B005LAIIHG,Ranny Levy,"[7, 10]","The most amazing 3D quality movie that shows underwater footage and sea life. Life of Pi is base on a popular book by Yann Martel's novel that sold over 7 million copies. It's about a boy name Piscine Patel known as Pi (Suraj Sharma). He has a good life growing up in his father's zoo in Pondicherry, a French colony. Due to hard times, they have to close down the zoo and move some of the animals to Canada with them. The move to Canada is in a big Japanese cargo ship and all the animals are at the bottom of the ship.A big storm hits the ship and sinks it. The survivors are Pi, a tiger (Richard Parker), zebra, hyena, orangutan and a rat. They are all in a small life boat from the cargo ship. After several days, the only two survivors are Pi and Richard Parker. They were afraid of each other but need each other to survive.There are so many scenes with great cinema-photography. The most memorable ones are the underwater footage and the sinking of the cargo ship is so real and clear. The 3D brings out the glowing of the jelly fish and the blue wale vividly. Special effects of the tiger is the best part. It seems so real, I thought that the tiger is actually in the boat with Pi. The part I did not like is when the animals were fighting each other. It's too hard to watch the survival of the fittest.The acting in this movie is so great. Suraj show a lot of emotions with his eyes and he stays in character and the audience can feel his emotions. It's so amazing to see his weight loss as the days go by at sea. My favorite character is Richard Parker. He helps Pi survive the shipwreck and at times he seems more human than creature. The lesson in this movie is anything is possible. Pi survives over seven months in the Pacific Ocean with just faith and Richard Parker.I rank this movie 4 out of 5 stars. I give this age range 8 and up. Cheyenne N, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.This is truly an amazing story, with a great adventure that is hard to believe. Pi, (Suraj Sharma) an Indian boy, is on a ship with his family who is moving to Canada. One night there is a terrible storm that sinks the ship and only Pi, a Hyena, Zebra, Orangutan and a Bengal Tiger whose name is Richard Parker survive. They are all in one of the small life boats trying to stay alive. After a while it only becomes Pi and Richard Parker who are adrift in the Pacific Ocean. Pi is now trying to survive, but is in fear of Richard Parker.Based on the best-selling novel by Yann Martel, this adventure is created in 3D and is one of my new favorites. The visual effects are amazing and capture the marine life really well with all its beautiful colors. I like the way this film is set up like someone is telling it as a story, this really keeps my attention. One of my favorite scenes is when a big whale comes out of the ocean; it is so big and pretty to see. It is incredible. I also like the way we learn how the Tiger is named Richard Parker. It is somewhat funny and unusual.I would love to know How Director, Ang Lee, directs all the animals in this film, it is truly amazing how they act. David Magee, (Screenplay writer) is doing a remarkable job on transforming a great novel into an amazing script. Other casts in Life of Pi include Vibish Sivakumar (Ravi Patel) and Rafe Spall (The Writer).A big message I found is to never lose hope no matter where you are in life. Pi is in the middle of the ocean for many many days with a big storm, and a Tiger, but through it all he never loses hope to be rescued. I recommend this film for ages 8 to adults. Younger ages may be a little frightened when they see some of the animal scenes, but other than that, this is a must see. You can enjoy it with your family and friends. I give Life of Pi 5 out of 5 stars. I love the message and the visual effects. This is a great story of hope and determination.

At one point his father says, &#34;following multiple faiths is no faith at all!&#34;; and I would agree, but somehow Pi's simplicity of faith is believable. While the lion's (or Tiger's) share for the excellence of this film - my opinion - should go to Ang Lee, the performance by 17 year old Suraj Sharma, in his film debut, as Pi Patel, should not be overlooked. It is in many ways a masterful performance, not often attained by experienced actors twice or three times his age.

I wasn't crazy about some of the CGI animals, but overall it was pulled off rather well. I've read other reviews asking why he kept doing a certain thing and it makes me think that maybe people didn't fully understand the movie. Others complained that it was slow, but the pacing seemed fine for this type of film. It's not supposed to be a big action movie so I can't imagine anyone wanting to speed up the story telling. In a lot of ways, it made me think of Ernest Hemingway's book The Old Man and The Sea. It felt very much like that in so many ways, but Pi puts in a little more craziness. Overall, I thought the film was very good and worth the rental fee.Now, as far as the blu ray disc...it doesn't seem to work in all players. I actually rented the Blu Ray disc and it would not play in my blu ray player. I did the usually stuff like updating the firmware to the latest update. Still, no go. I tried playing it in my computer which has a blu ray player. Nothing. I updated the blu ray software on my comp and still nothing. I did some research and some people have stated that because of a very new type of menu on the blu ray not all players will be able to play it, even with all available updates. It seems that some companies have not updated their software / firmware to make the blu ray work, but I am sure it will be fixed very soon. I had the same problem with the blu ray version of Skyfall.

1486595,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B005LAIIHG,RMurray847,"[6, 12]","Ang Lee's adaptation of the strangely beloved novel is, to my recollection (it's been a few years since I read the book) quite faithful to both the events and the spirit of the novel.  And thus, it has many of the same successes and failures of the source material.Pi is a young man, living in India with his family.  They run a zoo there, and Pi learns to love animals.  He's also a boy full of curiosity, and as he becomes acquainted with Hindu, Catholic & Jewish beliefs and traditions, he embraces a hodge-podge of ideas.  He selects what sounds good to him, or what is most helpful to him in coming to understand the world around him...both what he sees and what can't be seen.Eventually, the family is forced by political upheavals to move the entire zoo enterprise to Canada.  But on the sea voyage across the Pacific, a terrible storm hits and the ship sinks.  Pi finds a lifeboat, but so do several zoo animals, including, most importantly, the Bengal Tiger named Richard Parker.  The bulk of the movie deals with Pi and Parker's LOOOONG sea voyage and how they survive a harsh environment, the wondrous things they see and the relationship they establish.Lee has filmed this saga in 3D, and I recommend you see the film this way if you can.  The 3D is some of the most sparkling and dazzling since AVATAR.  While it's clear much of the film must be CGI, the CGI rarely shows.  In fact, it is nearly impossible to believe that the tiger wasn't flesh & blood much of the time.  It is rendered dazzlingly.  In fact, the whole movie sparkles in a way that creates a heightened reality (or, puts a touch of fantasy onto reality).  There's no question in my mind that from a technical perspective, LIFE OF PI is one of the best this year.The story itself is undeniably gripping.  I liked that no sentimental relationship is developed between Pi and the tiger.  This animal is a killer.  It is wild and dangerous.  The two create an understanding, but there is never mutual affection.  It is not a story of anthropomorphism.  There are many utterly gripping scenes (the storm is particularly effective), a fair number of humorous moments and some scenes that are simply gorgeous to look at.  Even though the pace is somewhat deliberate at times, I was never bored.But, as with the book, PI wants to be profound.  The narrator of the film (I won't say more about who that is) tells a listener, ""you will believe in God"" after hearing the story.  I not see how this story could make someone believe in God.  The ending essentially attempts to be a validation of the young Pi's early ideas about embracing what you want from various religions rather than needing to follows all the dictates of just one belief system.  While one could debate the merits of this argument (and the other argument the end of the film posits, which I won't hint at for fear of spoiling things)...there is NO emotional heft to them within the LIFE OF PI.  This was the huge failing of the book, which told such a splendid story, only to diffuse it all with poppycock pop spiritualism.  Lee, rightfully so, I suppose, has not changed this...but his film also collapses under the mundane nature of this films revelations.  (PI author Yann Martel's follow-up novel BEATRICE AND VIRGIL suffers the same bloated sense of self-importance, but is also unpleasant to read).I know others find the insights of LIFE OF PI to be nearly miraculous.  I'm sorry, I just don't see it.  To me, this story has become one of those things we now teach in schools (my daughter had to read it in high school) because it SEEMS as though it has great literary import.

as Santosh Patel,Pi's father and G&eacute;rard Depardieu as the Cook.This is a stunningly visual treat which keeps you mesmerized through a good part of the film.The animals that one sees through a good part of the film,are mostly CGI creations.And it is not hard to tell that they are just that,but the film doesn't linger too long on them as to undo your suspension of disbelief altogether.Lee just keeps pushing the story along.And that story opens as a reporter in Montreal is interviewing an Indian man who starts to relate a rather bizarre tale;one that will have you ""believing in God"".The man relates as to how he got his name of Pi,as in the mathematical symbol.It seems an uncle liked a swimming area in Paris called the Piscine Molitor,and he became Pi for short.One day the father sees the writing on the wall and he decides to move his family to Canada;Winnipeg specifically.The father and the family run a zoo.They sell what animals they can and take the rest.Part way through the voyage,just past Indonesia,a fierce storm comes up and the ship sinks,taking with it Pi's entire family.In a lifeboat hanging from the davit,there is the ships cook,into which is thrown Pi.Suddenly a Zebra loose from below decks,jumps from a storey up and onto the boat,breaking both its legs and sending the cook overboard and the boat into the water.Pi ends up in the water more than once but witnesses from under it the ships last breath as it sinks beneath the waves like a surreal lighted leviathan.Pi makes it back into the boat.Next morning things start to move.A hyena suddenly appears from under the boat awning cover and starts to harass Pi and the Zebra.Suddenly an orangutang joins this motley crew.It isn't long before the hyena gets its sea legs and it starts to attack and kills the zebra.Time passes and it goes after and kills the orangutang.Just as it is about to attack Pi a tiger comes out from under the awning and kills the hyena.From this moment on Pi must learn not only to survive but survive without getting eaten by the tiger.For the first part of their journey Pi builds himself a makeshift raft on which to live,keeping a rope attached from the boat to his raft.Eventually,after many travails,and at the end of his rope,Pi comes on board and teaches the tiger how to behave when told.It surprisingly works and the two get on relatively well.They come upon a floating island whose inhabitants are mostly meerkats.It has fresh water ponds in which to drink and the tiger has plenty of food(meerkats).As Pi lay asleep in the night the meerkats take to the tress and the tiger goes back to the boat.The why becomes plainly clear when at night the ponds become acidic and kill everything that are in or may fall into them.Pi and the tiger leave the island the next day.They eventually wash up on shore in Mexico and are rescued.Shortly thereafter reps from the Japanese shipping company come a calling to Pi asking questions about the reasons behind the sinking and his story of survival.Pi relates the tiger story to them and when they ask for the truth he relates another story of he being stranded with his mother,a sailor and the cook.The sailor was injured and the cook killed the sailor.When a struggle occurs later his mother pushes Pi to safety as she gets stabbed to death.Pi later returns and kills the cook and drifts alone at sea until he reaches Mexico.In the present the reporter looks at the actual shipping report and it seems the reps chose the tiger story over the other.When asked by a now grown up Pi which one he preferred,he replies the tiger story also.The film ends as Pi introduces the reporter to his two children and his wife.After all we have seen and experienced Lee decides to give us a nice twist of an ending.Which story would we have preferred to see?.....the tiger story of course,and that is what we got.As the film begins one wonders where it is going as it visually describes Pi's childhood,which has its funny and serious moments.But the movie really starts to take off at about 30 minutes into the film when the ship begins to founder and sinks.One really feels like you are right there with Pi as he experiences the monumental loss of not only his family,but his way of life,all his belongings and the ship that would take him to a new life.With just his wits,some common sense,the teachings of his family and his religious beliefs,he must somehow survive and endure an indescribably tough,but at the same time,beautifully rich life trial.Along the way we are treated to a myriad of visually stunning moments such as the appearance of bio luminescent fish and a whale who breaches as it comes up to feed on same,the meerkats on the island,the sinking of the ship and so many more.And,if you haven't guessed,they are just that much more stunning because it may not have been real to begin with....right?Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1.There is an""extra""category on this DVD but all it contains are trailers.Kind of a false advert if you ask me.All in all a treat for the visual senses.A simple story told with a straightforward touch but with a heck of a twist ending.The CGI animals are good but not fool proof,and Ang Lee steers his film with a deft touch never lingering too long on any one thing.It was nominated for 11 statues and won four.Well deserved.4

1486604,A277MYG7MQTKYW,B005LAIIHG,Robert Blenheim,"[66, 74]","Ang Lee's ""Life of Pi"" is a masterpiece with some of the most beautiful and unforgettable images ever displayed on film. Not only did it give me an experience of the wonder in being alive while moving me to tears, but its story also encompassed a human life from childhood to mature age while dealing with pain and guilt that are part of the human experience.Ang Lee isn't thought of as an Asian auteur in the class of Wong Kar-wai, Zhang Yimou or Lee Chang-dong. He's actually more of a commercial director than a personal artist, but what he does in transferring the ""Life of Pi"" from novel to screen is miraculous.  Perhaps no director has ever captured the beauty and fear of the power of life, and when you look deep into the eyes of the tiger ""Richard Parker"", you see what Marlowe saw in Kurtz's eyes in Conrad's ""The Heart of Darkness"": a power so vast it dwarfs you with an awareness of your mortality, showing you your insignificance beside the powers of all life.  What Ang Lee does here in this film will, I believe, remain his tour-de-force, and is a work of art I will come to many times in the future.The acting is wonderful, primarily Irrfan Khan, one of India's greatest actors who plays the adult Pi.  Khan provides an entire acting course just in the way he uses his face, displaying a smile in the film's climax that rivals the Mona Lisa's in its ambiguity.  You see the world of pain, guilt, joy and sadness in his delicate expression.The film is supremely spiritual in every frame, yet, if one is paying attention, it winds up as somewhat of a Trojan Horse in what it ultimate reveals about religion.  I'm trying hard not to provide a spoiler here, but there are five words spoken by the adult Pi at the end of the film that viewers seem to miss that spell it out.  But moving away from its theme, no film I have ever seen in my life comes close to ""Life of Pi"" in relating the sheer force of nature (making you experience the beauty and terror in the soul of a tiger) and the cosmic beauty of our world, both inner and outer.  Using 3-D more brilliantly (and essentially) than any film to date, this film burned into my mind incredible visual sights impossible to find anywhere else, showing me beauty I will remember the rest of my life.Highly recommended, and one that truly deserves to be seen in 3-D.",5,A must-see masterpiece of the beauty of being alive,1361491200,"02 22, 2013",2013,2327,"['Ang', 'Lee', 'Life', 'Pi', 'masterpiece', 'most', 'beautiful', 'unforgettable', 'images', 'ever', 'displayed', 'film', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'give', 'experience', 'wonder', 'being', 'alive', 'moving', 'tears', 'story', 'also', 'encompassed', 'human', 'life', 'childhood', 'mature', 'age', 'dealing', 'pain', 'guilt', 'are', 'part', 'human', 'experience.Ang', 'Lee', ""n't"", 'thought', 'Asian', 'auteur', 'class', 'Wong', 'Kar-wai', 'Zhang', 'Yimou', 'Lee', 'Chang-dong', 'actually', 'more', 'commercial', 'director', 'personal', 'artist', 'what', 'transferring', 'Life', 'Pi', 'novel', 'screen', 'miraculous', 'Perhaps', 'director', 'ever', 'captured', 'beauty', 'fear', 'power', 'life', 'when', 'look', 'deep', 'eyes', 'tiger', 'Richard', 'Parker', 'see', 'what', 'Marlowe', 'saw', 'Kurtz', 'eyes', 'Conrad', 'Heart', 'Darkness', 'power', 'vast', 'awareness', 'mortality', 'showing', 'insignificance', 'powers', 'life', 'What', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'here', 'film', 'will', 'believe', 'remain', 'tour-de-force', 'work', 'art', 'will', 'come', 'many', 'times', 'future.The', 'acting', 'wonderful', 'primarily', 'Irrfan', 'Khan', 'one', 'India', 'greatest', 'actors', 'who', 'plays', 'adult', 'Pi', 'Khan', 'entire', 'acting', 'course', 'just', 'way', 'face', 'displaying', 'smile', 'film', 'climax', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'ambiguity', 'see', 'world', 'pain', 'guilt', 'joy', 'sadness', 'delicate', 'expression.The', 'film', 'supremely', 'spiritual', 'frame', 'yet', 'one', 'paying', 'attention', 'up', 'somewhat', 'Trojan', 'Horse', 'what', 'ultimate', 'reveals', 'religion', ""'m"", 'trying', 'hard', 'not', 'provide', 'spoiler', 'here', 'are', 'five', 'words', 'spoken', 'adult', 'Pi', 'end', 'film', 'viewers', 'seem', 'miss', 'spell', 'out', 'moving', 'away', 'theme', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'life', 'close', 'Life', 'Pi', 'relating', 'sheer', 'force', 'nature', 'making', 'experience', 'beauty', 'terror', 'soul', 'tiger', 'cosmic', 'beauty', 'world', 'inner', 'outer', 'Using', '3-D', 'more', 'brilliantly', 'essentially', 'film', 'date', 'film', 'burned', 'mind', 'incredible', 'visual', 'sights', 'impossible', 'find', 'anywhere', 'else', 'showing', 'beauty', 'will', 'remember', 'rest', 'life.Highly', 'recommended', 'one', 'be', 'seen', '3-D']",N/A

1486612,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B005LAIIHG,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 1]","****1/2In an era in which CGI has made it possible to put virtually anything one could possibly imagine up on the screen, it has become harder and harder for a filmmaker to make an audience's collective jaw drop. But Ang Lee achieves just that with his adaptation of Yann Martel's ""Life of Pi."" This movie truly has what we, in modern parlance, like to refer to as ""the wow factor,"" simply because it is unlike anything we've seen on screen before. ""Life of Pi"" is a surrealistic tale of survival about an Indian boy trapped on a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean with nothing but a ferocious Bengal tiger for a companion.The first thought we are struck with while watching ""Life of Pi"" is that this movie would have been impossible to make prior to the CGI revolution in filmmaking. With so many movies abusing that technology for sheer commercial ends, it's gratifying to see a film actually using it for thought-provoking and artistic purposes (see also ""Gravity""). At times brutally harsh while at others gloriously lyrical, the movie combines the realistic with the fantastical, the rational with the spiritual - all to illustrate the many disparate and dichotomous elements that, working in glorious chaotic tandem, make up this vast expanse we call the universe.The first third of the film focuses on Pi's life before the shipwreck. Pi (short for Piscine, which as it shares a rather unfortunate homonym in English, causes Pi at a very early age to abbreviate it) is innately curious about not only the world around him but the world that lies beyond the physical. He is so fascinated with the spiritual, in fact, that he has adopted the tenets of each of the world`s major religions and made them his own. Pi lives with his stern, skeptical father (Adil Hussain), his more open-minded, sympathetic mother (Tabu) and his somewhat less curious older brother (who is played by three different actors in various stages of the story). One of the prime exhibits in the zoo owned by Pi's father is a Bengal tiger that, through a bureaucratic fluke, has been tagged with the name Richard Parker, a prosaic moniker hardly befitting the king of the jungle. When the father decides to sell the zoo, the family, along with the animals, board a Japanese freighter to begin a new life in Canada (the plan is to sell the animals once they get there). On the way, however, tragedy strikes when the ship sinks in a tremendous storm, sending all but Pi and Richard Parker to the bottom of the sea. ""Life of Pi"" is the story of their survival.Alternately awe-inspiring, heartbreaking and suspenseful, the screenplay by David Magee expands on the  ""circle of life"" metaphor to explore how each element of nature is interlocked with every other element, with each action prompting a reaction unto infinity. Though natural born ""enemies,"" Pi and Richard Parker achieve a kind of symbiosis, ultimately forced to rely on one another for survival (RP for his physical needs, Pi for his spiritual), and in so doing, they achieve a harmony that puts them in sync with the rest of the universe. Yet, for all its pantheistic elements, the movie doesn't over-sentimentalize nature, doesn't shy away from showing us the unthinking brutality that is also a part of that universe, underlined by the fact that living creatures can survive only by feeding on other living creatures. It certainly never downplays the very real danger Pi is in at every moment from his feline companion. This cat may be animated, but he's no cartoon character.Never one to shy away from a challenge, Lee won a second Best Director Oscar for his work here, and someday the Academy might even see fit to bestow a Best Picture award on him as well (he was certainly robbed of that honor for ""Brokeback Mountain""). As he has done many times before, Lee demonstrates a total command of the medium in ""Life of Pi."" There's a hallucinatory quality to much of the film, as Pi frequently experiences preternatural visions that transcend the confines of the material world and of rational thought, leading him to a oneness with God.Suraj Shama has been handed the challenge - one might almost call it the burden - of carrying large stretches of this film entirely on his own, with only a CGI effect to interact with. It is a challenge the gifted young actor is more than equipped to handle and he fulfills it beautifully.Though the movie throws the audience for a loop at the end, making us question the veracity of the tale the adult Pi (Irrfan Kahn) is relating to the writer (Rafe Spall) who hopes to chronicle the experience, no one can ever convince the true believer in all of us that this is anything other than a love story between a boy and a tiger. After all - thanks to the technical wizards who've made it all possible - we've seen it with our own eyes.",4,A Boy and His Tiger,1394841600,"03 15, 2014",2014,4811,"['****1/2In', 'era', 'CGI', 'made', 'possible', 'put', 'virtually', 'anything', 'one', 'could', 'possibly', 'imagine', 'up', 'screen', 'become', 'harder', 'harder', 'filmmaker', 'make', 'audience', 'collective', 'jaw', 'drop', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'just', 'adaptation', 'Yann', 'Martel', 'Life', 'Pi', 'movie', 'truly', 'what', 'modern', 'parlance', 'refer', 'wow', 'factor', 'simply', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'screen', 'Life', 'Pi', 'surrealistic', 'tale', 'survival', 'Indian', 'boy', 'trapped', 'lifeboat', 'middle', 'ocean', 'nothing', 'ferocious', 'Bengal', 'tiger', 'companion.The', 'first', 'thought', 'are', 'struck', 'watching', 'Life', 'Pi', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'impossible', 'make', 'prior', 'CGI', 'revolution', 'filmmaking', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'abusing', 'technology', 'sheer', 'commercial', 'gratifying', 'see', 'film', 'actually', 'using', 'thought-provoking', 'artistic', 'purposes', 'see', 'also', 'Gravity', 'times', 'brutally', 'harsh', 'others', 'gloriously', 'lyrical', 'movie', 'realistic', 'fantastical', 'rational', 'spiritual', 'illustrate', 'many', 'disparate', 'dichotomous', 'elements', 'working', 'glorious', 'chaotic', 'tandem', 'make', 'up', 'vast', 'expanse', 'call', 'universe.The', 'first', 'third', 'film', 'Pi', 'life', 'shipwreck', 'Pi', 'short', 'Piscine', 'shares', 'rather', 'unfortunate', 'homonym', 'English', 'Pi', 'very', 'early', 'age', 'abbreviate', 'innately', 'curious', 'not', 'only', 'world', 'world', 'physical', 'so', 'fascinated', 'spiritual', 'fact', 'adopted', 'tenets', 'world', 's', 'major', 'religions', 'made', 'own', 'Pi', 'stern', 'skeptical', 'father', 'Adil', 'Hussain', 'more', 'open-minded', 'sympathetic', 'mother', 'Tabu', 'somewhat', 'less', 'curious', 'older', 'brother', 'who', 'played', 'three', 'different', 'actors', 'various', 'stages', 'story', 'One', 'prime', 'exhibits', 'zoo', 'owned', 'Pi', 'father', 'Bengal', 'tiger', 'bureaucratic', 'fluke', 'been', 'tagged', 'name', 'Richard', 'Parker', 'prosaic', 'moniker', 'hardly', 'befitting', 'king', 'jungle', 'When', 'father', 'sell', 'zoo', 'family', 'animals', 'board', 'Japanese', 'freighter', 'begin', 'new', 'life', 'Canada', 'plan', 'sell', 'animals', 'once', 'get', 'there', 'way', 'however', 'tragedy', 'strikes', 'when', 'ship', 'tremendous', 'storm', 'sending', 'Pi', 'Richard', 'Parker', 'bottom', 'sea', 'Life', 'Pi', 'story', 'survival.Alternately', 'awe-inspiring', 'heartbreaking', 'suspenseful', 'screenplay', 'David', 'Magee', 'circle', 'life', 'metaphor', 'explore', 'how', 'element', 'nature', 'interlocked', 'other', 'element', 'action', 'prompting', 'reaction', 'unto', 'infinity', 'natural', 'born', 'enemies', 'Pi', 'Richard', 'Parker', 'achieve', 'kind', 'symbiosis', 'ultimately', 'forced', 'rely', 'one', 'survival', 'RP', 'physical', 'needs', 'Pi', 'spiritual', 'so', 'doing', 'achieve', 'harmony', 'sync', 'rest', 'universe', 'pantheistic', 'elements', 'movie', ""n't"", 'over-sentimentalize', 'nature', ""n't"", 'shy', 'away', 'showing', 'unthinking', 'brutality', 'also', 'part', 'universe', 'underlined', 'fact', 'living', 'creatures', 'can', 'survive', 'only', 'feeding', 'other', 'living', 'creatures', 'certainly', 'never', 'very', 'real', 'danger', 'Pi', 'moment', 'feline', 'companion', 'cat', 'may', 'be', 'animated', 'cartoon', 'character.Never', 'one', 'shy', 'away', 'challenge', 'Lee', 'won', 'second', 'Best', 'Director', 'Oscar', 'work', 'here', 'Academy', 'might', 'even', 'see', 'fit', 'bestow', 'Best', 'Picture', 'award', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'certainly', 'robbed', 'honor', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'done', 'many', 'times', 'Lee', 'total', 'command', 'medium', 'Life', 'Pi', 'hallucinatory', 'quality', 'much', 'film', 'Pi', 'frequently', 'preternatural', 'visions', 'transcend', 'confines', 'material', 'world', 'rational', 'thought', 'leading', 'oneness', 'God.Suraj', 'Shama', 'been', 'handed', 'challenge', 'one', 'might', 'almost', 'call', 'burden', 'carrying', 'large', 'stretches', 'film', 'entirely', 'own', 'only', 'CGI', 'effect', 'interact', 'challenge', 'gifted', 'young', 'actor', 'more', 'equipped', 'handle', 'movie', 'audience', 'loop', 'end', 'making', 'question', 'veracity', 'tale', 'adult', 'Pi', 'Irrfan', 'Kahn', 'relating', 'writer', 'Rafe', 'Spall', 'who', 'chronicle', 'experience', 'one', 'can', 'ever', 'convince', 'true', 'believer', 'anything', 'other', 'love', 'story', 'boy', 'tiger', 'thanks', 'technical', 'wizards', 'who', ""'ve"", 'made', 'possible', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'own', 'eyes']",N/A

1486615,A1X37MVQFQEGHA,B005LAIIHG,Romanovsky,"[9, 30]","The movie is like a puddle that pretends to be a sea.The plot is simple, though it does not mean that simple plots go with bad movies. It's just a fact that the plot is not that sophisticated:The main character tells a writer a long story with a promise that after hearing it, the writer will believe in God. So the storyteller tells how he survived a disaster at sea, sailing in a boat with a Bengal tiger. At the end of the story the teller suddenly says that it was not true and tells an alternative, more scarier story of his survival without the tiger. Then the teller asks the writer which story he prefers. The writer chooses the first story, with the tiger. And the teller says that it goes with God. As simple as that.I'm surprised that the movie's budget was 150 mil. Where is the money? In 3D and visual effects? Do they call it movies nowadays? For me, a good movie is a well-told story, not a show of technical progress. I wanted to see a story of a spiritual odyssey, personal growth, how the main character loses or obtains his faith, how a boy becomes a man, but it was all so shallow that I feel cheated.Why should someone believe in God if he listens to the story? Why does the first story go with God and why can't the second story go with God? What's wrong with it? Does the author mean that believing in good sweet stories means to have faith? Is God just a palatable story that people choose to believe? Why does the truth must be something that one choose to believe in? Why does the boy start believing in 3 religions and finish at the same level? He does not change, does not growth, doesn't question his faith.Was he searching for God? He was but where is his journey? He is not an ""enlightened"" person but still the same nave young boy, a flat cartoon character all the time. He starts as a nave believer and ends up as a nave believer, no lapses, no temptations, and no spiritual growth. Did he ""surrender"" to God? So what? It does not make the story more intelligent or spiritual, or less cooked up and artificial.I do not want to choose neither story because I do not like them both. Neither story proves anything for me. To me, it's mainly a story about how a boy tamed a tiger sailing in one boat. The rest - so called ""layers"" and allegories are nonsense, attempts to add depth to look wise and philosophical but in fact, it's just a substitute of a true spiritual journey. It's an ersatz spirituality taught by an ersatz guru.A friend of mine asked me who I think Richard Parker (the tiger) was in fact? I have no idea. It's an open-ended question. There are no right or wrong answers, I guess. The answer that one believes is ""true"" - must be the true answer for the believer. It could be the tiger, it could be the boy (since he had known the tiger since the Zoo times), it could be God or personal relationships of God and the boy, it could be the boy's animal nature, it could be his relative, it could be the cook (why not?), it could be just a fruit of the boy's imagination, or Yann Martel (the author) himself, or it could meanall things together at the same or different time.There is a chance that none story is real, so it's hard to explore Martel's mind and tell what he meant creating the puzzle. I do not think that Martel is a fool but when I'm thinking of the movie, I am recalling this Italian saying: ""A fool can ask more questions than seven wise men can answer."" Well, I can also ask more questions than seven wise men can answer, but I do not pretend to be smart.Like it or not, to me the story sounds fake, artificial, and cartoon-like. It's a beautiful 3D postcard as flat as it is, not a true spiritual odyssey with trials, ordeals, and temptations.Talking about personal journeys and spiritual growth, I prefer The Odyssey.THE ODYSSEY (1997) Armand Assante, Gretta Scacchi DVDPS If you enjoyed the movie and did not find my review helpful, could you please answer a few questions and explain your point of view?I am a Christian. I believe in omnipotent (all powerful), omniscient (all knowing), and omnipresent (existing everywhere at once, always present) God. You may have different beliefs. Hold on them and try to look at the story without its beautiful visual effects.Suppose, an illegal immigrant's boat sank somewhere in Florida and theillegal immigrant was saved by the US Coast Guard. The guardsmen who areatheist, Jewish, Buddhist, Muslim, and Christian ask the guy, ""Whatare you doing here? Are you American?"" And the immigrant says, ""Chill out,guys! After hearing my story, you will believe in God."" And he startstelling them how he survived 227 days after a shipwreck, sailing in the boattogether with a crocodile, a cat, and a dog. He suffered a lot. Thecrocodile ate the dog and the cat. There was no food. To survive, theillegal immigrant had to learn fishing and even tame the beast. Then there was astorm. The immigrant surrendered to God and together with the crocodilereached the US coast where the crocodile escaped.Will the guardsmen believe the story? Of course, not. They will ask theillegal immigrant to stop bulls***ing them and tell them the real story. Sothe illegal immigrant tells them another story, where he sailed in the boattogether with a criminal who killed his two friends, other illegalimmigrants. The guardsmen say, ""Another bulls***, but we can't prove whichstory is real."" The immigrant says, ""It's your problem. But if youprefer the first story, you must know that it goes with God.""Questions: Will the atheist guardsmen believe in God after hearing the story? How will the immigrant's story prove them the existence of God? Why does the first story go with God and what's wrong with the second? Why can't the second story prove the existence of God? Will the first story support the beliefs of the Jewish, Muslim, and Christian guardsmen?..

I looked forward to seeing this film after all the hype (to say nothing of the Academy Awards), so it was inevitable, I suppose, that I was disappointed.The tension between the rational and the ineffable -- science and religion, reason vs. faith, has always been my favorite literary device.  Think ""Inherit The Wind"", Spencer Tracy version.  The only new insight here is the line ""Someone else introduces us to God when we are young"" (I paraphrase).  I let that sink in.  True enough.This movie reminded me in some ways of ""Cast Away"" -- ship/plane-wrecked at sea and lost on a deserted island.  One man has a Bengal tiger, the other a Wilson soccer ball.  Of the two films, ""Cast Away"" works more cogently for me at illuminating the human condition.  Faith or Fact?  The fork in the road -- the crossroad at the end of ""Cast Away"", and all the choices which preceeded it.  I'm not being dragged into a discussion of whether or not I ""believe in God"", or ""which story I believe"".  Better the mirror held up to see the reflection of a lifetime of choices.The atheist and the person of faith share the same conundrum: neither can speak rationally about the unknowable or metaphysical.  And since no one really knows, we all must wait until our fate meets us.  And therein liveth the fable.ADDENDUM:  I watched this movie a second time in order that I might better connect with the dialogue and narration.  I understand the question (is there a God?), but not the conclusion here: God is in the story.  Life is full of sorrow (polio, shipwrecks, evil people -- which includes the hero here, as he admits in his second version of the story), but also of beauty and joy.  But what we experience as ""real"" depends on how we tell the story?  And that's where we find God?  Too thin for me.  I do appreciate the author and director for tackling this question, however.  That alone makes this a better-than-average film.ADDENDUM #2:  I bought the 3D BluRay, and I must disagree with the people who say the 3D effects are lacking.  This is the best 3D movie I have purchased yet, including ""Avatar"", ""Hugo"", ""Bolt"", and ""John Carter"".  The 3D effects are very good on my Sony 3D BD player and 65"" Vizio 3D HDTV.

1486662,A7YMD8MSOBO1I,B005LAIIHG,Sharon Beverly,"[4, 6]","If only it were possible to rate LIFE OF PI as a 10-stars video, based on the following:* Plot--This story is as magical as the fairy tales that fascinated us as children* Characters-- Despite their foreignness (to us) as Indians, they have universal appeal as a family of four embarking on a life-changing journey.  The father is strict, knowing that he must teach his sons life's lessons in order to survive.  The mother's compassionate, yet practical.  The older son is more like the father; not so vulnerable to life's travails.  Younger son, Pi, is soulful and his classmates' bullying has helped strengthen his character and his ability to overcome adversity by using his clever intelligence.* Dialogue--Conversations are believable and flow alongside the narration.  While the characters have Indian accents, it is easy to understand what they are saying.* Acting--It is amazing how well the main protagonist, Pi, portrays his role.  It is his first professional acting and his performance is exceptionally good.  Each actor has fulfilled his/her role admirably.* Direction--Ang Lee is known for exploring complex themes.  His adaptation of the novel was outstanding.  He won the Best Director Oscar at the 85th Academy Awards, pitted against the renowned Steven Spielberg.* Sequencing--There are no disjointed cuts in this movie.  With so many locales and scenes, it is almost expected to be choppy in places.  The movie segues seamlessly from one moment to the next.* Sets--Filming is done in India, Canada, on a ship, at sea, a tiny island, and in a hospital room.  The vast majority of it is at sea on a small lifeboat and flimsy raft.  The smallest details are included in each one, adding depth to their locales.* Visual Effects--Done with CGI, it is impossible to discern if the animals are real or digitally portrayed.  Staring into the tiger's eyes is frightening and at times, breathtaking, as Richard Parker's (the tiger's) face assumes almost human emotions.* Color--Simply spectacular!  We watched this on a Samsung TV, giving us an enormous spectrum of color in many shades. Compared to watching other movies and regular programming, the hues of this film were superior to anything else we have seen, except at movie theaters.* Technology--Filmed in HD and 3D, viewers get as realistic a feeling of actually `being there' as possible.  Clarity overall was excellent and made the nighttime sea life and storm scenes `pop'.  The same is true for the island locale.  While we do not have 3D, we think those very scenes and locales must do a magnificent job of enhancing the experience.If you usually watch a movie more than once, then you can count on enjoying LIFE OF PI many times.",5,"Incredibly Portrayed , Captivating",1370736000,"06 9, 2013",2013,2701,"['only', 'were', 'possible', 'rate', 'LIFE', 'OF', 'PI', '10-stars', 'video', 'based', 'following', '*', 'Plot', 'story', 'as', 'magical', 'fairy', 'fascinated', 'children*', 'Characters', 'foreignness', 'Indians', 'have', 'universal', 'appeal', 'family', 'four', 'embarking', 'life-changing', 'journey', 'father', 'strict', 'knowing', 'must', 'teach', 'sons', 'life', 'lessons', 'order', 'survive', 'mother', 'compassionate', 'yet', 'practical', 'older', 'son', 'more', 'father', 'not', 'so', 'vulnerable', 'life', 'travails', 'Younger', 'son', 'Pi', 'soulful', 'classmates', 'bullying', 'helped', 'strengthen', 'character', 'ability', 'overcome', 'adversity', 'using', 'clever', 'intelligence', '*', 'Dialogue', 'Conversations', 'are', 'believable', 'flow', 'alongside', 'narration', 'characters', 'have', 'Indian', 'accents', 'easy', 'understand', 'what', 'are', 'saying', '*', 'Acting', 'amazing', 'how', 'well', 'main', 'protagonist', 'Pi', 'role', 'first', 'professional', 'acting', 'performance', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'actor', 'fulfilled', 'his/her', 'role', 'admirably', '*', 'Direction', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'known', 'exploring', 'complex', 'themes', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'was', 'outstanding', 'won', 'Best', 'Director', 'Oscar', '85th', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'pitted', 'renowned', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', '*', 'Sequencing', 'are', 'disjointed', 'cuts', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'locales', 'scenes', 'almost', 'expected', 'be', 'choppy', 'places', 'movie', 'seamlessly', 'one', 'moment', 'next', '*', 'Sets', 'Filming', 'done', 'India', 'Canada', 'ship', 'sea', 'tiny', 'island', 'hospital', 'room', 'vast', 'majority', 'sea', 'small', 'lifeboat', 'flimsy', 'raft', 'smallest', 'details', 'are', 'included', 'one', 'adding', 'depth', 'locales', '*', 'Visual', 'Effects', 'Done', 'CGI', 'impossible', 'discern', 'animals', 'are', 'real', 'digitally', 'portrayed', 'Staring', 'tiger', 'eyes', 'frightening', 'times', 'breathtaking', 'Richard', 'Parker', 'tiger', 'face', 'almost', 'human', 'emotions', '*', 'Color', 'Simply', 'spectacular', 'watched', 'Samsung', 'TV', 'giving', 'enormous', 'spectrum', 'color', 'many', 'shades', 'Compared', 'watching', 'other', 'movies', 'regular', 'programming', 'hues', 'film', 'were', 'superior', 'anything', 'else', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'theaters', '*', 'Technology', 'Filmed', 'HD', '3D', 'viewers', 'get', 'realistic', 'feeling', 'actually', 'being', 'there', 'possible', 'Clarity', 'overall', 'was', 'excellent', 'made', 'nighttime', 'sea', 'life', 'storm', 'scenes', 'pop', 'same', 'true', 'island', 'locale', 'do', 'not', 'have', '3D', 'think', 'very', 'scenes', 'locales', 'must', 'do', 'magnificent', 'job', 'enhancing', 'experience.If', 'usually', 'watch', 'movie', 'more', 'once', 'then', 'can', 'count', 'enjoying', 'LIFE', 'OF', 'PI', 'many', 'times']",N/A

Heckenlively,"[232, 271]","This may be the hardest movie review I've ever written, somehow words don'texpress it quite right ...To begin, I saw Life of Pi in 3-D. A week later I went back and saw it again,because I don't foresee having another chance. I expect the color and detailwill remain gorgeous in 2-D, and I definitely intend to buy the disc.However the 3-D in this movie is spectacular. The tiger, Richard Parker, isat the top of the list, but in fact the entire movie benefits tremendouslyfrom 3-D. If you liked Avatar, you probably liked the marvelous animals.And I'm sure in some scenes, Richard Parker is CGI'd to some extent. ButLife of Pi has a real earthly animal to work with, and you can argue thereis no animal on earth more beautiful or fierce than a tiger. That's partof the genius of this movie, and I'm sure one reason James Cameron likedit so much.That brings me to another point about this movie, its suitability for kids.Hopefully by now you understand the tiger is not a cuddly pet. Its very mucha wild animal, just like you can see in nature videos. Except in this moviethe tiger is a lot closer. He wants to eat Pi. Pi can't always see the tiger.The audience knows the tiger is going to try something, but that just makes itall the more nerve-wracking. Or exciting, depending on the person watching.This movie made me jump several times, and I was often clutching the arms ofmy chair. Its pretty intense in places. More so the second time I saw it.I kid you not.""Tiger, tiger, burning brightIn the darkness of the night""- William Blake""Tell me what you see""- PiRegarding the story, I will say the movie starts out to establish what kindof a kid Pi was when he was growing up in India. This helps us know Pi as amulti-dimensional character. But the beauty of this part of the movie isthe kind you can see every day, not the visionary beauty that comes later.Maybe it takes more effort to see it, because its a little too much like ourown lives when we were kids. Growing up can seem mundane. But sometimesit can also be dangerous. Or heartbreaking.Once the movie shifts to the ocean, its very easy to believe that now wehave our arms around the story. But Life of Pi is one of those movies wherewe don't really know the story at all, until the last word of dialog hasbeen spoken. There's more than one story here, and most of what makes youthink, after its over, comes at the very end. You have to pay attention topick it all up.

1486691,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B005LAIIHG,Steven Aldersley,"[13, 18]","It's been four years since Slumdog Millionaire took home eight Oscars. I found myself thinking of that movie because Life of Pi opens in India and the cast is predominantly comprised of Indian actors. Like Slumdog Millionaire, the movie uses several actors to portray the main character at different ages. In fact, the older Pi is played by Irrfan Khan, who appears in both movies.The story is framed with the older Pi relating his story to a writer. We learn that Pi's father owned a zoo, and his mother worked there as a botanist. His father is fond of giving Pi advice, and one memorable lesson involves a demonstration of how dangerous tigers can be, and that they should not be treated like a pet or a friend.Pi is shown at four different ages, but the bulk of the story shows Pi as a young man, so Suraj Sharma receives the most screen time. Like Cast Away and 127 Hours, the movie relies on one actor holding our attention, and Sharma does a wonderful job of doing just that. It's his first role and he had to show a vast range of emotions in order for everything to work.The first part of the movie shows Pi's life as a young boy. We see him go to school, and ultimately fall in love. But his life (and the story) is shaken up when his mother and father inform him that they have decided to move the family to Canada. Along with some of the animals, they set sail for their new home. If you have seen the trailer, or even the poster for this movie, it's not a spoiler to reveal that Pi ends up in a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger. I imagine that's quite a selling point, as a lot of people would wonder how such a relationship could possibly work.Director Ang Lee overcomes the limitations of such an enclosed setting in several spectacular ways. It's fascinating to see how Pi tries to survive, as well as co-existing with a dangerous carnivore. The visual aspects of the movie are of the highest quality, and I would be shocked if the movie wasn't nominated in several technical categories. The tiger is convincing, but the visual effects also shine when we are shown some of the things that can happen at sea.I think Life of Pi is a movie that should be experienced without knowing too much of the story beforehand, so I am not going to reveal anything more about the plot. Although I will mention that the ending is open-ended and leaves you guessing about what really happened out on the ocean.Religion is an ever-present theme. The movie will ask you to think about why the events in our lives happen, and whether they are random or part of God's plan. But more than one religion is mentioned, and it's not done in an overbearing way.The script is well-written, and is a big reason why the story works. There is quite a bit of humor, but it's smart and feels natural.I'm not sure how many movies I have seen this year, but this is one of the best. The story feels fresh and unusual, and some of it is profound and moving. I should also say that a few of the animals are hurt or even killed, so be warned if you are sensitive to such things. That said, you would see more brutality on a nature documentary like Planet Earth.Life of Pi grabbed my attention early and held it for two hours. It's more than special effects, with the screenplay and acting both standing out. I highly recommend it.Overall score 4.5/5",5,One of the best movies of 2012,1357344000,"01 5, 2013",2013,3323,"['been', 'four', 'years', 'Slumdog', 'Millionaire', 'took', 'home', 'eight', 'Oscars', 'found', 'thinking', 'movie', 'Life', 'Pi', 'India', 'cast', 'predominantly', 'comprised', 'Indian', 'actors', 'Slumdog', 'Millionaire', 'movie', 'several', 'actors', 'portray', 'main', 'character', 'different', 'ages', 'fact', 'older', 'Pi', 'played', 'Irrfan', 'Khan', 'who', 'movies.The', 'story', 'framed', 'older', 'Pi', 'relating', 'story', 'writer', 'learn', 'Pi', 'father', 'owned', 'zoo', 'mother', 'worked', 'there', 'botanist', 'father', 'fond', 'giving', 'Pi', 'advice', 'one', 'memorable', 'lesson', 'demonstration', 'how', 'dangerous', 'tigers', 'can', 'be', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'treated', 'pet', 'friend.Pi', 'shown', 'four', 'different', 'ages', 'bulk', 'story', 'Pi', 'young', 'man', 'so', 'Suraj', 'Sharma', 'most', 'screen', 'time', 'Cast', 'Away', '127', 'Hours', 'movie', 'one', 'actor', 'holding', 'attention', 'Sharma', 'wonderful', 'job', 'doing', 'just', 'first', 'role', 'had', 'show', 'vast', 'range', 'emotions', 'order', 'everything', 'work.The', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'Pi', 'life', 'young', 'boy', 'see', 'go', 'school', 'ultimately', 'fall', 'love', 'life', 'story', 'shaken', 'up', 'when', 'mother', 'father', 'inform', 'have', 'decided', 'move', 'family', 'Canada', 'Along', 'animals', 'set', 'sail', 'new', 'home', 'have', 'seen', 'trailer', 'even', 'poster', 'movie', 'not', 'spoiler', 'reveal', 'Pi', 'up', 'lifeboat', 'Bengal', 'tiger', 'imagine', 'quite', 'selling', 'point', 'lot', 'people', 'would', 'wonder', 'how', 'such', 'relationship', 'could', 'possibly', 'work.Director', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'limitations', 'such', 'enclosed', 'setting', 'several', 'spectacular', 'ways', 'fascinating', 'see', 'how', 'Pi', 'survive', 'as', 'well', 'co-existing', 'dangerous', 'carnivore', 'visual', 'aspects', 'movie', 'are', 'highest', 'quality', 'would', 'be', 'shocked', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'nominated', 'several', 'technical', 'categories', 'tiger', 'convincing', 'visual', 'effects', 'also', 'shine', 'when', 'are', 'shown', 'things', 'can', 'happen', 'sea.I', 'think', 'Life', 'Pi', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'experienced', 'knowing', 'too', 'much', 'story', 'beforehand', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'reveal', 'anything', 'more', 'plot', 'will', 'mention', 'ending', 'open-ended', 'guessing', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'out', 'ocean.Religion', 'ever-present', 'theme', 'movie', 'will', 'ask', 'think', 'why', 'events', 'lives', 'happen', 'are', 'random', 'part', 'God', 'plan', 'more', 'one', 'religion', 'mentioned', 'not', 'done', 'overbearing', 'way.The', 'script', 'well-written', 'big', 'reason', 'why', 'story', 'quite', 'bit', 'humor', 'smart', 'feels', 'natural.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'many', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'year', 'one', 'best', 'story', 'feels', 'fresh', 'unusual', 'profound', 'moving', 'should', 'also', 'say', 'few', 'animals', 'are', 'hurt', 'even', 'killed', 'so', 'be', 'warned', 'are', 'sensitive', 'such', 'things', 'said', 'would', 'see', 'more', 'brutality', 'nature', 'documentary', 'Planet', 'Earth.Life', 'Pi', 'grabbed', 'attention', 'early', 'held', 'two', 'hours', 'more', 'special', 'effects', 'screenplay', 'acting', 'standing', 'out', 'highly', 'recommend', 'it.Overall', 'score', '4.5/5']",N/A

1486693,A2WPAUTK46SQ31,B005LAIIHG,Steven Johnson,"[1, 3]","Ang Lee's latest film Life of Pi is a visually stunning and breathtaking experience. It is one of the few films that, in my opinion, is actually better suited for 3D than boring ol' 2D, and is perfect to experience in the movie theater rather than Netflixing in a couple months.Pi is so impressive because it is consistently entertaining and surprising for two or so hours, surprising for a plot that doesn't have much action. It does follow a pretty standard Hero's Journey format, with some pretty sad (but not tear-jerking) moments. By the end, it becomes clear that almost every scene is necessary (save the love story that goes nowhere). Plus, it borrows from Big Fish in that much of what REALLY happened is left open to interpretation, and I like to see that in big-budget movies. It is far too infrequent that we get films that generate engaging discussion among audiences, and I am happy that Life of Pi gives us that opportunity.The film's strongest suit, as you've no doubt heard, is its visual effects. The best effects, in my opinion, are always those which blur the line between what is real (physical) and what is not (CGI), and Life of Pi provides consistently jaw-dropping and convincing images that are hard to forget. The camera work is exceptional as well, with non-traditional shots and transitions. Some of the most memorable are bird's-eye shots, overlooking the protagonist Pi and the tiger Richard Parker floating in the sea, at a perfect 90-degree angle.As much of a visual and intellectual treat as Life of Pi is, it is hard for me to imagine Academy members and audiences regarding it as the best film (not just one of the best films) of 2012. I absolutely liked it, hands down - but in a year with emotional powerhouses like Silver Linings Playbook, Brave, and many other movies that left a stronger impression on me, it is really a far cry from Best Picture 2012.",4,Intelligent and visually stunning,1369440000,"05 25, 2013",2013,1893,"['Ang', 'Lee', 'latest', 'film', 'Life', 'Pi', 'visually', 'stunning', 'breathtaking', 'experience', 'one', 'few', 'films', 'opinion', 'actually', 'better', 'suited', '3D', 'boring', 'ol', '2D', 'perfect', 'experience', 'movie', 'theater', 'rather', 'Netflixing', 'couple', 'months.Pi', 'so', 'impressive', 'consistently', 'entertaining', 'surprising', 'two', 'so', 'hours', 'surprising', 'plot', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'action', 'follow', 'pretty', 'standard', 'Hero', 'Journey', 'format', 'pretty', 'sad', 'not', 'tear-jerking', 'moments', 'end', 'clear', 'almost', 'scene', 'necessary', 'save', 'love', 'story', 'nowhere', 'Big', 'Fish', 'much', 'what', 'REALLY', 'happened', 'left', 'open', 'interpretation', 'like', 'see', 'big-budget', 'movies', 'far', 'too', 'infrequent', 'get', 'films', 'generate', 'engaging', 'discussion', 'audiences', 'am', 'happy', 'Life', 'Pi', 'film', 'strongest', 'suit', ""'ve"", 'doubt', 'heard', 'visual', 'effects', 'best', 'effects', 'opinion', 'are', 'always', 'blur', 'line', 'what', 'real', 'physical', 'what', 'not', 'CGI', 'Life', 'Pi', 'consistently', 'jaw-dropping', 'convincing', 'images', 'are', 'hard', 'forget', 'camera', 'work', 'exceptional', 'as', 'well', 'non-traditional', 'shots', 'transitions', 'most', 'memorable', 'are', ""bird's-eye"", 'shots', 'overlooking', 'protagonist', 'Pi', 'tiger', 'Richard', 'Parker', 'floating', 'sea', 'perfect', '90-degree', 'angle.As', 'much', 'visual', 'intellectual', 'treat', 'Life', 'Pi', 'hard', 'imagine', 'Academy', 'members', 'audiences', 'regarding', 'best', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2012', 'absolutely', 'liked', 'down', 'year', 'emotional', 'powerhouses', 'Silver', 'Linings', 'Playbook', 'Brave', 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'left', 'stronger', 'impression', 'really', 'far', 'cry', 'Best', 'Picture', '2012']",N/A

1486698,A26MJME9IBNETY,B005LAIIHG,StrangePegs,"[1, 4]","I finally got around to watching Life of Pi. I was less than impressed.Sure, it was full of great visuals. Amazing visuals, even, but those don't make the story. [It's the same reason I could never follow a crappy story in a comic book just because it had good art (Spawn).] The story in Pi was very much lacking. The only reason it gets such a ""wow, that was so deep"" response is that it's one of those stories (the movie for sure and probably the book (though I haven't read the book)) that people can't figure out. Rather than say ""I don't understand,"" they instead say, ""that's so deep."" Especially the critics, who can never just admit that something doesn't make any sense. Vague symbolism is always a sure way to baffle the critics into saying something is great. [One of my college professors was the same way. The sure way to getting an ""A"" from him on a paper was to write something beyond his understanding or deliberately vague enough that it seemed beyond his understanding. Rather than say ""I don't know what you're saying here"" or ""This doesn't make any sense,"" he'd just put an ""A"" on it.]However, the biggest problem with that aspect of the movie is that there is a message in there, revealed twice during the movie but obfuscated rather than just stated plainly: believing a lie is better than believing nothing. Or, as it's put forth at the end, ""It's better to believe a beautiful lie rather than an ugly truth."" That's a sorry message to be delivering and one I just can't get behind. No matter how pretty the package it's wrapped in, and Pi is a pretty package with beautiful bows and ribbons. It's not enough to disguise the ugly truth of the movie, though. Well, maybe, actually, it is. For most people.The other big issue I have with the movie is that I hate (I mean I absolutely can not stand) getting to the end of a story just to find out that it didn't happen. [I mentioned this same thing in my review of Looper.] Don't waste my time with a story about a story that didn't happen. Don't have it turn out to be a dream. Don't have it turn out to be a time loop that gets closed off so that none of it happened. Don't have it turn out to be a hallucination to cover up something that the character can't handle. You've wasted my time at that point.And, in Life of Pi, it reduces the only interesting part of the movie to the 30-40 minutes that happen before the storm. Then it's over. And that was hardly a story and one in which nothing really happened other than that someone survived a horrible stranding at sea.And, sure, you can get all wrapped up in discussions about whether the tiger was God or what the heck was that island supposed to be, anyway, or whether he just made up the story he told the insurance people about the cook just so that they would have something they could grasp, but none of it matters. It doesn't matter because of the statement, ""Which is the better story, and wouldn't you rather believe that thing than believe the truth?""So, yeah, sure, Pi was pretty. It deserved the awards it got for those aspects of the movie, but it certainly wasn't a ""best directed"" movie. It was a hardly directed movie. I'm glad I watched it; I even kind of wish I'd seen it on the big screen just for some of the scenes on the ocean; but I don't think it was a great movie.

1486708,A151OW029XD9JU,B005LAIIHG,Susan Tunis,"[619, 700]","Wow, this has been an exciting fall for literary adaptations!  I read Yann Martel's Life of Pi a decade ago and thought it was fantastic storytelling.  I cheered when it won the Man Booker Prize.  So, I was quite excited to attend an advance screening recently with several members of my book group.  I remembered the novel quite well in broad strokes, but not the fine detail.  I didn't refresh my memory before watching the film, but was curious enough to reread Life of Pi in its entirety before writing this review.  The film is very true to the novel in spirit and tone, but there are small changes, additions (generally positive), and elisions (some noteworthy).The film opens similarly to the novel.  The idea is the same, but the execution is slightly different.  Different mediums require different storytelling tools.  For instance, I believe most film-goers will readily recognize The Writer (portrayed by actor Rafe Spall, who replaced a distractingly famous Toby Maguire) as a stand-in for author Martel.  In the novel, it is Martel himself, in direct address to readers, who fulfills this role, effectively blurring the line between fact and fiction.  It is established that this story is being related to The Writer by an older Pi.  From there, readers are introduced to a young Piscine Molitor Patel and the world he inhabits.  It's a charmed childhood, being raised at the Pondicherry Zoo amongst a loving family and exotic animals--an Indian ""We Bought a Zoo.""  These scenes are as lush and colorful as any Bollywood musical.I've discussed this novel with other readers countless times over the years.  It's beloved by many, but truly hated by a vocal minority.  I've never understood the vitriol, personally.  Martel writes beautifully and accessibly.  His story is fast-paced and yet deeply rooted in character.  And it explores the boundless subject of faith through an extraordinary tale--a ""story to make you believe in God.""  But one complaint I've heard from readers is frustration over (or lack of interest in) Pi's religious explorations early in the novel.  The young man is a practicing Hindu, Christian, and Muslim.  Martel never belabored the point, but those readers will be gratified to see that director Ang Lee has streamlined the beginning of the tale to move more swiftly to the meat of the story.And that comes about when Pi's family packs up their lives, their animals, and moves the whole kit and caboodle to Canada by ship.  Well, that's the plan.  Something goes wrong in rough seas outside of Manila.  The ship goes down in a haunting scene, and now the stage is set.  Sixteen-year-old Pi is shipwrecked in a lifeboat with a zebra, an orangutan, a hyena, and a 450-pound adult Bengal tiger named Richard Parker.  It's survival of the fittest on the high seas, and things get Darwinian fast.  Soon enough, it's Pi and Richard Parker in it together.When I first heard the premise of this novel, somehow I thought Richard Parker would be some kind of cute, anthropomorphized tiger, and oversized puddy tat.  He was not.  He was a terrifying predator, and he stayed a terrifying predator, throughout Pi's ordeal.  This was much the same in the movie (although not quite to the degree as in the novel, a change commented upon by Martel in the Hollywood Reporter).  Richard Parker was scary in the book, but he was terrifying on the screen.  I flinched as he snarled and lunged in 3D.From here, both novel and film take on an episodic or picaresque quality.  The film is delightfully dream-like from its opening frames.  (An early scene of the swimming pool from which Pi derives his name enchanted me!)  But as the days at sea pass, and the ribs of both animals become plainly visible, the film shifts from dream-like to hallucinatory.  Episodes and encounters become increasingly extraordinary.  Sitting in the audience, I could clearly discern who had read the novel and who had not by the gasps and exclamations.  (Among my friends, the film was enjoyed equally by those who had read the book and those who had not.)Yes, there are episodes that are missing from the film, one of which is quite notable.  Fans may miss it.  And, yet, I can understand the choices made.  Cuts were judicious.  As noted earlier there are a few small shifts and changes.  But this is a very faithful adaptation of Martel's novel, and I suspect it will please most fans of the original.  What is lost is more than made up for by how Ang Lee has brought Martel's fantastic vision to life.The cinematography and design of this film is exquisitely beautiful.  I'm not a huge fan of 3D technology, but once in a while it seems to really augment a film.  Such is the case here--all the better to experience a small boat on the vast ocean.  And while we're on the subject of technology, the CGI work on the tiger is seamless.  None of us could detect where the real tiger ended and the computer-generated beast began.  I have heard that young Suraj Sharma never once filmed with the live animal.  For safety, their scenes were filmed separately.  And I don't know how much footage was of a real cat.  All I can say is that the illusion is extraordinarily believable.  That a first-time actor could give such a convincing performance playing opposite an imaginary tiger is doubly impressive.  The success of the film lies firmly on Sharma's moving portrayal of 16-year-old Pi, but the supporting performances were equally strong.  It was Spall's response to Pi's story at the end of the film that actually gave me chills.I've been circumspect about revealing specifics of the plot.  I'll leave all the surprises of Pi's voyage intact for those new to the tale.  And readers of the novel can see for themselves what made the cut.  About the ending...  Those who have read the novel know what to expect.  Now film-goers can join the debate we've been having for the past decade.  In the end, it truly is all about faith.

1486730,A3LAKFK21AQPSE,B005LAIIHG,The Bigmac,"[17, 22]","I'm going to focus my review mainly on the 3D aspect of this Blu-Ray, and about how the movie compares to Avatar 3D-wise, which is to date the visual benchmark by which other 3D movies are judged. As for the movie itself it's an amazing piece of film-making whose plot and pace reminded me of the movie Castaway.Now, onto the 3D:When I originally watched the movie Avatar in theaters, its 3D effect blew my mind. For me, that movie is the benchmark all 3D movies should aspire to achieve, when it comes to 3D implementation. Over the years, and after watching avatar in the theater, I've watched a mixed bag of 3D movies that initially led me to believe 3D in the living room would never achieve the quality of what I watched in the theater when Avatar knocked my socks off and introduced me to the world of modern 3D. Then, after a period of exclusivity with Panasonic, Avatar 3D was finally made available on Blu-Ray. To my surprise, after watching avatar in 3D Blu-Ray in the comfort of my living room, it looked EXACTLY the same as in the theater. Perfect. Visually astounding. And one HUGE detail: Crosstalk free. (For the uninitiated, crosstalk if the effect present in many 3D movies in which the edges of objects on the screen look blurry and doubled. Many people not only find this effect annoying but it's known to case headaches and even nausea in many moviegoers). The fact that Avatar was 100% crosstalk free led me to one conclusion: 3D Blu Rays can look every bit as good in your living room as the movie originally looked on the theater screen, as long as the movie is done right, shot right and encoded right. Just like James Cameron did with Avatar. Which finally brings me to Life of Pi.This Blu Ray movie packs the best 3D I've seen, after the hundred or so movies that have graced my TV screen since avatar. The 3D effect in Life of Pi is absolutely flawless. Crosstalk is absolutely non-existent. I can't stress this enough. The fact that this movie nails its 3D presentation and it contains zero crosstalk whatsoever, along with the masterful way in which director Ang Lee shot this movie take your movie experience to a whole new level. When you're watching the movie the absence of crosstalk allows you to forget for a second you're watching a Blu-Ray movie and that you-re wearing the stupid glasses and simply allows you to immerse yourself in the visuals. Your eyes get used to the new dimension they're perceiving instantly and you end up losing yourself in the lush landscapes and in the incredibly rich color palette this movie brings to your living room. The colors are so vibrant, the objects  so sharp and defined you almost feel you're looking through a glass.Unlike gimmicky 3D movies that try to impress you by throwing objects at your face, the 3D effect in Life of Pie is used instead to immerse the viewer in this fantastic world. It's done tastefully, technically impeccably and with amazing results. And unlike said gimmicky 3D movies in which you feel like you're just watching a 2D movie with dark glasses 90% of the time, and the 3D is just reserved for fast paced action scenes that make up probably 10% of the movie, in Life of Pi 3D is present on the screen almost 99% of the time. Like it's one more color the director was able to play with when painting this masterpiece. You don't need to wait for an action scene to see the 3D in all its glory. As soon as the movie starts and you're presented with the lush visuals of an Indian zoo, you see the 3d in all its glory. 2 minutes into the movie the narrative takes you to the protagonist's living room where he is having a conversation with a book writer. Two characters sitting in a living room talking. A scene that most 3D movies wouldn't even consider introducing 3D on, (let alone using their 3D budget to enhance), yet in Life of Pi, as mundane as a scene like this could be, is giving the royal 3D treatment and you see the characters, perfectly defined in the foreground, and the rest of the living room, purposefully out of focus in the background, like if it is the background of the actual living room you're sitting in.Whereas avatar is a CGI fest, (and that's a flavor of movie I also certainly enjoy) In terms of visual effects, Life of Pi is just a different animal. CGI, while definitely existent, is only one, amongst many aces under the  director's sleeve. He also plays, with color, (and boy does he!) contrast, angles, landscapes, and also the masterful 3D implementation to submerge you in the story.To sum it up, not only is this an amazing movie totally worth watching, but this 3D Blu-Ray is one you will definitely want to keep on your shelf whenever you want to show your 3D setup to your friends. Along with avatar, it is in my opinion the finest example of 3D done right you can have in your collection. Definitely reference material for 3D quality, and also proof that whenever you get crosstalk ridden cheaply done 3D movies, is not because the technology is not there yet but because the movie was not shot or encoded properly, and basically they were cheap, lazy, or both. The technology to make your living room 3D look as good as the best theater 3D can offer, is definitely there. And Ang Lee took it and ran with it.",5,Best 3D Blu-Ray since Avatar.

1486732,A1VH6QWC6JZRAC,B005LAIIHG,The Guardian,"[0, 0]","Ang Lee has a fine record for making unusual films, and from `Eat Drink Man Woman' through `Hulk' to `Brokeback Mountain' has proven to be the antithesis of a formulaic director. True to form, his film of Yann Martel's ""un-filmable"" book `Life of Pi' is a triumph of cinematography and storytelling. The underlying themes of God-evidenced-in-Nature and the victory of the human spirit in adversity are very well realised by Lee's narrative structure and editing, and the film is a feast for the eyes and the mind.The story is told in first-person narrative with Pi as narrator, his character played by four different actors as he ages. The excellent young Suraj Sharma takes the lion's share (tiger's share?) as the 16-year old Pi in the film's main sequence when adrift on the Pacific with Bengal tiger Richard Parker following a shipwreck. Sharma (picked from 3,000 actors who auditioned for the part) delivers a convincing performance of fear, struggle, cool intelligence & courage, and gradually masters his hostile environment and terrible predicament, growing spiritually on the journey as he asserts dominance over the tiger so that they might both survive. Although for safety reasons the tiger and Sharma were filmed separately, you will absolutely believe in the terrifying visceral power of their face-to-face confrontations and in their developing relationship.The wildlife in the film looks superb and the wild animals behave exactly like wild animals, red in tooth and claw. There's no sentimentality here, and the viewer is never spared the cruelties of nature. For this reason the film may be disturbing to young children despite its often enchanting visual content.The Blu-ray 3D release contains a documentary film (itself in 3D) about the making of the film in which Lee explains how he conceived the film from the beginning as a 3D experience for the audience, and that this is the medium in which it needs to be seen. There's a lot of detail here for film buffs.Some have chosen to nit-pick at details of the film and a few have disliked it; it may be that for those viewers this is just not the kind of story that floats their boat, so to speak. `Life of Pi' strives to explore deeper territory than the average Hollywood fare, in a highly original way. Lee succeeds in discussing the philosophy of religion; is there a creator and where can we experience evidence of it in nature? This is quite a difficult trick to pull off in a 127-minute film whilst entertaining the audience at the same time, but Lee's rare talent does just about manage it - and with a sting in the tail, too: at the end of the day, which story do you prefer?",4,Ang Lee's unusual Oscar winner demonstrates how to film the `un-filmable',1368576000,"05 15, 2013",2013,2654,"['Ang', 'Lee', 'fine', 'record', 'making', 'unusual', 'films', 'Eat', 'Drink', 'Man', 'Woman', 'Hulk', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'proven', 'be', 'antithesis', 'formulaic', 'director', 'True', 'form', 'film', 'Yann', 'Martel', 'un-filmable', 'book', 'Life', 'Pi', 'triumph', 'cinematography', 'storytelling', 'underlying', 'themes', 'God-evidenced-in-Nature', 'victory', 'human', 'spirit', 'adversity', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'realised', 'Lee', 'narrative', 'structure', 'editing', 'film', 'feast', 'eyes', 'mind.The', 'story', 'told', 'first-person', 'narrative', 'Pi', 'narrator', 'character', 'played', 'four', 'different', 'actors', 'excellent', 'young', 'Suraj', 'Sharma', 'lion', 'share', 'tiger', 'share', '16-year', 'old', 'Pi', 'film', 'main', 'sequence', 'when', 'adrift', 'Pacific', 'Bengal', 'tiger', 'Richard', 'Parker', 'following', 'shipwreck', 'Sharma', 'picked', '3,000', 'actors', 'who', 'auditioned', 'part', 'convincing', 'performance', 'fear', 'struggle', 'cool', 'intelligence', 'courage', 'gradually', 'masters', 'hostile', 'environment', 'terrible', 'predicament', 'growing', 'spiritually', 'journey', 'dominance', 'tiger', 'might', 'survive', 'safety', 'reasons', 'tiger', 'Sharma', 'were', 'filmed', 'separately', 'will', 'absolutely', 'believe', 'terrifying', 'visceral', 'power', 'face-to-face', 'confrontations', 'developing', 'relationship.The', 'wildlife', 'film', 'superb', 'wild', 'animals', 'behave', 'exactly', 'wild', 'animals', 'red', 'claw', 'sentimentality', 'here', 'viewer', 'never', 'spared', 'cruelties', 'nature', 'reason', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'disturbing', 'young', 'children', 'often', 'enchanting', 'visual', 'content.The', 'Blu-ray', '3D', 'release', 'documentary', 'film', '3D', 'making', 'film', 'Lee', 'how', 'conceived', 'film', 'beginning', '3D', 'experience', 'audience', 'medium', 'be', 'seen', 'lot', 'detail', 'here', 'film', 'buffs.Some', 'have', 'chosen', 'nit-pick', 'details', 'film', 'few', 'have', 'disliked', 'may', 'be', 'viewers', 'just', 'not', 'kind', 'story', 'boat', 'so', 'speak', 'Life', 'Pi', 'strives', 'explore', 'deeper', 'territory', 'average', 'Hollywood', 'fare', 'highly', 'original', 'way', 'Lee', 'discussing', 'philosophy', 'religion', 'creator', 'where', 'can', 'experience', 'evidence', 'nature', 'quite', 'difficult', 'trick', 'pull', 'off', '127-minute', 'film', 'whilst', 'entertaining', 'audience', 'same', 'time', 'Lee', 'rare', 'talent', 'just', 'about', 'manage', 'sting', 'tail', 'too', 'end', 'day', 'story', 'do', 'prefer']",N/A

It starts off with the crude explanation on how he got his name. It contrasts this with Pi's discovery of religion to the point of believing in universalism. His lofty ideas are quickly contrasted with a dose of reality when a tiger, he thinks he has connected with, eats a live goat. After he develops a love interest we finally come to the meat of the tale.His family opts to go to Canada on a Japanese merchant ship and if everything went okay, you wouldn't see a picture of Pi in a boat with said tiger promoting this film. His life's experience are reflected in his relationship with the tiger and survival at sea.Pi's life is one filled with contrasts. He is a microcosm of India and perhaps the world as his name is symbolic of the constant the defines circles, orbs, and globes. That is the spiritual aspect. However his name derives from the &#34;P&#34; word giving it a dose of crude reality. The film/book is designed to be a metaphor. This is demonstrated in the end when Pi gives us two stories, then asks, &#34;Which do you prefer?&#34; as a way to test one's views in a world of contrasts.While the film is interesting on a number of levels, it is heavily narrated with an accent. This caused me to occasionally miss a word every now and then. Hopefully the DVD will have English subtitles.Parental Guide: No sex or nudity. While rated PG I thought Pi dropped the F-bomb near the end when he was talking about the two Japanese investigators. It was tough to tell with the accent.

1486735,ALJLONJXLA3OQ,B005LAIIHG,The People's Critic,"[18, 24]","First of all, if you like to enjoy a film in its purest and unanticipated sense, just know Ang Lee's Life of Pi is a spectacular cinematic experience. Now stop reading and go see it. For the rest of you, prepare yourself for The People's Critic to convince you that you should find a two-hour break in your day to go see this movie.Ang Lee has been one of those directors who can shatter cultural bias and stereotype and make films that cut to the bone of virtually any genre, culture, or philosophy. A Taiwanese filmmaker, Lee disappears into his material like no other filmmaker. His personal stamp on a film is simply that he gets it right. The Ice Storm revealed his ability to poetically peel the layers off of the American suburban lifestyle and reveal some of the chaos that lies beneath the calm, picturesque surface. His adaptation of Jane Austen's Victorian Romance Sense and Sensibility was pitch perfect. Additionally he has shown a steady hand at vividly visual genre films like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Brokeback Mountain. These films bare little resemblance to each other, except that they ""get it right."" Furthermore, no better example for Lee's ""getting it right"" can be given than his adaptation of Yann Martel's Life of Pi.Life of Pi is a narrative framed by Pi as an adult(Ifran Kahn) telling his story to a writer. This frame story can be summed up by paraphrasing a quote by the writer who says he's a Canadian who went to French-India looking for a story only to find there's an Indian in French-Canada with a story to tell. The film then transports us back to French-India in the late 1970s where Pi(now played by Suraj Sharma) begins an epic tale of self-discovery.Now, clearly most viewers will be eagerly awaiting the story of the guy on a boat with a tiger, but this film is much more than this. It is a religious film, but it does not preach. Instead, it takes into consideration all of the ideas, beliefs, doubts, and misconceptions that exist and simply tells a story. Do not overlook or underestimate the film's opening act; the setup is as rewarding as the visual magnificence that is to follow. Needless to say, it is the visual effects and cinematic beauty that will doubtless be the conversation surrounding Life of Pi and deservedly so. From the moment the map of the Mariana Trench appears on the screen, hold on to your seats! No film, including Avatar, has achieved this level of visual grandeur with 3D technology. What is more, Life of Pi exists right here on our own planet. Lee's careful precision as a director, takes full advantage of every opportunity to amaze the audience with wonder.Inevitably, Pi does find himself in the unique situation of living on a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger. However, this is all that is unique about it. Many films have explored the survivor element of what the limits of human endurance are. What allows Pi to rise above those is the spiritual depth that is created from the film's opening act and the awe-inspiring visual effects that are second to none.Life of Pi is a low-key masterpiece. It sneaks up on you and while not complicated, welcomes multiple viewings. The opening credits depicting animals happily living in captivity holds new meaning after experiencing the film for the first time. Lee presents a very enjoyable and thought-provoking version of Martel's widely admired source material. It was said that Life of Pi was one of those unfilmable stories- that it can exist in the mind of the reader and nowhere else. Lee has proven those skeptics incorrect; however, this film is more than a companion or adaptation of the novel. It has surpassed that into something much more special and distinctive.

1486742,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B005LAIIHG,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[9, 12]","Ang Lee is a director drawn to projects because of their narrative and their potential beauty. I can't think of a film he has made that was dull to look at or uninteresting. Even ""Brokeback Mountain"" is beautiful to watch, something that could potentially detract from the overall narrative. But in Lee's hands, he brings both together in harmonious symphony. Now, with his latest film, an adaptation of the popular bestseller ""The Life of Pi"", he adds 3-D to the mix.I know it seems like every other film is released in 3-D now. After the success of ""Avatar"", studios are anxious to collect the extra $3 per ticket so even films that were not shot in 3-D are being retrofitted and released (or re-released) in 3-D.  I have yet to see one of these `retrofitted' films that truly use the magic of 3-D to enhance the viewing experience. Because they don't work, these unsuccessful films seem like a desperate money grab and only serve to leave a bad taste in the mouth.And because they are so eager for that extra $3, they make a lot of films in 3-D. For a while, every one of these films was deemed a huge success, but now the novelty has worn off and there have been a few 3-D flops, leading some chains to devote one theater per location to both 2-D and 3-D presentations of the same film, alternating the formats. Not a good development. There are still major blockbusters, the tentpoles the studios want and need to earn a billion dollars to prop up the rest of their releases. So every superhero film, pretty much all animation, most action and horror films, even a few comedies and dramas reach 3-D screens. Comedies and dramas? Why, so we can see the requisite scene of a character vomiting in 3-D? It isn't necessary for a lot of these films to be in 3-D. It simply doesn't add anything to the experience.Of course, there have been exceptions. ""Life of Pi"" is such an exception. Lee uses 3-D to add another visual layer, another texture to this almost fable-like film. He integrates the technique into the fabric of the story, making it a character. It is a pretty remarkable achievement.He also uses 3-D as an effective technique when composing the shots. As Pi relates the story of his uncle, a well-known swimmer, we watch as he enters a pristine public pool in France. A woman wearing a stylish sun hat sits in the foreground before Lee pulls the camera back to reveal the amazingly beautiful pool. Because of the time period, the storytelling nature and the art deco look of the public facility, we instantly become transported into the story.Early in the film, the adult Pi is telling his story to a writer (presumably Yann Martel, the writer of the book) and the scene dissolves to a shot of Pi's uncle swimming through a pool. The actor playing the adult Pi remains in the frame as the other character swims across the field of vision before we dissolve to the shot of the swimmer. I'm probably not doing this scene justice with my description, but the way Lee composes the shots, and uses 3-D to transition between them, really enhances the viewing experience and helps to build the tall-tale nature of the story.My only disappointment with the film is that Lee and his screenwriter David Magee (""Finding Neverland"", ""Miss Pettigrew Lives For a Day"") didn't take a little more license with the book. Generally, I find just the opposite in a book-to-film adaptation. Lee clearly respects Martel's original book (he has a reputation as a Writer's Director, adapting their work very methodically and carefully) and slavishly tries to adapt the entire tale to the screen for us to watch. Unfortunately, because Lee is so intent on delivering the whole book, he mars his overall film just slightly. In the book, Pi tells his story to a writer, beginning the narrative and popping back into the story whenever the writer needs some clarification. Lee has two actors playing Pi and the writer (Irfan Khan and Rafe Spall, respectively). The film opens in Pi's apartment in Montreal as he is preparing a vegetarian lunch for his guest. He starts telling his story and we watch as he cuts vegetables and prepares the meal. Later, when we revisit them, they have gone on a walk and spend some time in a park, watching the river, as Pi continues the story. Later, they return to his apartment as Pi finishes the story. We spend far too much time watching two people talk before the visual fades to images of what they are talking about. It just isn't necessary to see soooo much of this. These moments serve to draw us out of the narrative and visual, both of which Lee has done such a splendid job of creating. Why would we want to spend any time sitting in a non-descript apartment in Montreal watching two men discuss what we could be living through with the characters? In a book, this type of narrative device works better; as one of the characters is telling their story, you begin to imagine the visuals they are describing. It is also a much more seamless experience. But when you are watching a film, you want to see these descriptions played out. It is a little dull watching these two men sitting and talking, for so much of the film. When Lee tells the story in images, it is a truly memorable experience. When he spends so much time with the actors telling a story, it is less interesting.The visual part of the story is simply mesmerizing.  Once Pi and his family board the freighter with all of their animals, you know what will happen. Pi will eventually end up on a lifeboat with a tiger the family has named Richard Parker. While the story may be simplistic, Lee uses the visual quality of the setting to bring an almost ethereal quality to the film.As the two survivors battle each other, the elements and some truly spectacular unexpected elements, a story evolves and draws you into this unique universe.In the hands of a less accomplished director, spending a significant amount of film time with two characters, only one of which speaks English, could be problematic. First of all, the one actor has a lot of time on his hands, and the focus is on him. Just the slightest misstep and his portrayal falls apart. It is difficult to hold the attention of the audience for that long, but Suraj Sharma, who plays Pi, does a really good job. He deals with his situation in a natural way, never giving up hope, always pushing forward, trying to survive. Of course, this also seems natural because of all of the history we have already witnessed for his character (for instance, Pi's intense interest in religion), but he does a very good job of making the character seem natural and real. Too often when an actor has too much time on their own, they start to act overly theatrical, as though they are on stage giving a soliloquy. This isn't a far stretch; stage monologues are very similar and most actors have probably performed at least a few. But a monologue in a film is more problematic and the equivalent of two characters talking about an event, rather than showing it. In ""Pi"", it is necessary to see these moments, because they give us insight into the character. And Sharma steers clear of histrionics, unless they are necessary to show us his frustration.The CGI (Computer Generated Imagery) in ""Pi"" is a pretty remarkable achievement. On the one hand, CGI is used to create some of the animals and some of their interactions. The best compliment I can give is that it is difficult to tell when real animals are used and when the CGI takes over. Real animals were used at some point (a Tiger trainer is listed in the credits), but it is difficult to tell when the CGI begins. Richard Parker shares the most interactions with Pi and he becomes a character in the film; a huge, fearsome beast with feelings, needs and goals. You almost get to the point that you begin to understand what his roars mean.The CGI is also used to create some of the most beautiful tableaus you may have ever seen in a film. At one point, Pi and the tiger are sitting in the lifeboat in a completely lifeless sea; their reflection cast on the still water makes it look like we are looking in a mirror. The sky is filled with orange, yellow, red, all of which are also reflected. Of course, the water is not always so serene and the CGI helps to bring the fearsome storms and strange sea creatures to life in an almost brilliant way.Because most of the film is inhabited by two characters, in a limited space, the 3-D helps this space become more interesting and also gives us a better feeling of what this space is like, allowing us to get a feeling of what Pi and Richard Parker are going through. It also enhances the visual beauty of the film, making us feel as though we are in a second lifeboat watching the two interact.Lee has fashioned a beautiful, fable-like film advancing the use of two technologies to bring an otherwise unfilmable story to life.",4,A Life Time Pi,1355270400,"12 12, 2012",2012,8865,"['Ang', 'Lee', 'director', 'drawn', 'projects', 'narrative', 'potential', 'beauty',

1486759,A31BBNT8C62MLU,B005LAIIHG,Trancelucence (Leigh),"[3, 4]","What Terence Malick tried very hard to accomplish in The Tree of Life, with little success, for me anyway.  But THIS- hallelujah, thank-you Yann Martel and Ang Lee.  I've rarely been so moved by a film, was quite overcome.  Incredible!  Surely one of the best films ever made.  ***SPOILERS FOLLOW, THOUGH NOT THE ULTIMATE ENDING***I am an ardent animal lover too; here animals are symbolic of what Pi loves, the values he holds dear.  The film is an allegorical tale, a smorgasbord of metaphoric imagery and symbolism, jam-packed with them, and levels of meaning, designed to meet you where you are, take from it what you need.  I didn't watch this for a long time because I'd read the criticisms from horrified animal lovers.  What happened to the animals was handled with great dignity, care, and was CORE to the tale.  It's no accident that Pi is an animal lover and a vegetarian.  He's also a math whiz, seeks to understand life and the universe on every level possible. What was it young Pi sought from the three religions at the beginning?  He even meets a smiling Buddhist just before the accident who advises him to eat the gravy along with the rice, as ""sailors"", travelers do!Life, or fate, or God, can be viewed as terrible, unjust, incredibly cruel.  People die, animals eat each other, even more disturbing is what people do to each other (in the second story- the cook, and even Pi himself).  Paradoxically, life is also precious, a gift.  People (beings) in our lives are gifts too.  Towards the end, Pi does not cry for the obvious reason.  He was glad to be alive, in spite of it all (or because of it all?); his ONLY regret, and what brought tears was that HE hadn't thanked RICHARD PARKER!For me, this is about wonder (the word doesn't even begin to capture it)... what we've been given, gratitude on the most profound level.  We're human, we can reflect on such things.  The entire universe, not just tigers, is a reflection in your eyes, comes from the depths of yourself, or God's grace, or perhaps they're one and the same.  What is within, what is without?  On a more obvious level, Pi reaped what he sowed (the love you make...), he cared for Richard Parker, risking his life to do so.  Impeccable.  Or was it merely a tale of doing what one MUST to survive?  I think not.In purely human, historical terms, it reminded me ofThe Greely Expeditionto the North Pole vs theLewis & Clark Expedition.  Adolphus Greely, an inexperienced officer, started out bullying his men, threatened them (actually did kill one of them); they were contemptuous of him because he hid in his sleeping bag, head covered, shaking, terrified.  The U.S. government shirked their duty and didn't send food/supplies for them- most of the party died.  The men watched as, one by one, their friends died terrible deaths, from starvation, from frostbite.  But Greely rose to the challenge, gave his own food to his men, eventually evincing empathy, selflessness and courage, and by the end of the horrific ordeal, they adored him, credited him with keeping their spirits up, hope alive (btw, there WAS cannibalism).  They made it back and Greely lived a long, enjoyable, productive life, despite the horrors, the scandal.  The painstaking, exhaustive data that he risked his life to collect weren't even appreciated, gathered dust for nearly a century.  Climatologists are using them today, invaluable.Then, there was Meriwether Lewis.  The Lewis and Clark expedition, though arduous, uncertain, tough, resulted in the death of only one member (from appendicitis).  They saw wondrous sights, never before seen by colonial Americans (buffalo, grizzly bears, the great plains, giant trees, rain forests, waterfalls miles wide), and enjoyed hospitality and kindness from nearly all the Indians they encountered.  Upon returning home to a hero's welcome- his notes, maps, and specimens celebrated as marvels world-wide- Lewis never got over the hardships they'd endured, e.g., hunger, getting lost, being gone longer than expected, definitely a glass half-empty kind of guy, and faltered at every juncture.  He committed suicide three years after returning (though there was some speculation that it might have been murder, but Thomas Jefferson believed it to be suicide, and he knew Lewis better than anyone).Pi, like Greely, shows his mettle by virtue of his behavior, his perspective, what he perceives, and his interpretation of events (his stories).  From a purely psychological point of view, at the very least this is about the resilience of the human spirit, whether or not it springs from a divine source: To be, or not to be, is that the question? ""Which story do you prefer?""  YOU needn't wait until you lose everything to choose.  Much like Billy Crudup's character inBig Fish, who comes to understand, even share and revel in his father's mythos (but must first shed the self and societally-imposed blinders of supposed ""objective"" reality), Pi's metaphysics and mythos fuse.  GLORIOUS.Likely more meanings will unfold along with my understanding (haven't read the book yet; and I need to think more about the significance of the island).  I likedAvatartoo, often compared to Life of Pi, but for me it was no match, catharsis-wise.  Life of Pi does, however, remind me very much of another movie I loved that covers some of the same ground (though it's quiet, understated, subtle, not dazzling)-Dean Spanley.

Now imagine you had company in the form of a dangerous predator.We join the story of Piscine Molitor Patel in adulthood. Piscine, known as Pi (played by Irfan Khan) is an Indian living in Canada. One day, a young novelist comes to his door after being referred by a friend of his. Named after a swimming pool by his parents, Piscine came by his nickname after exhaustive chiding of his given name by classmates in school. His father ran a local zoo and Pi took an intense, and as far as his father was concerned, unhealthy, interest in the zoo's sole tiger. Named Richard Parker as the result of a clerical error, the tiger is fed a live goat while Pi bears witness in an effort by his father to instill an appropriate amount of fear. Though raised as a Hindu, Pi (played as an adolescent by Ayush Tandon) discovers Christianity as the result of a dare from his older brother and, by sheer chance, discovers Islam sometime after. As an adult, he refers to himself as a Catholic Hindu. At 16, Pi's father decides to close the zoo, sell the animals and move the family to Canada. This is a crushing development in the life of our main character as he has just fallen in love for the first time. The family and the animals make their journey west on a Japanese freighter. Woken by a severe storm, Pi goes to the top deck to marvel at the magnitude of the waves, wind, and rain. It is that extremely questionable decision which lands him in a lifeboat while his family and the rest of the crew sink with the ship. All this would make his chances of survival slim enough, but for better or worse, he's not alone in the boat. With him is Richard Parker the tiger, an orangutan he refers to as Orange Juice a zebra and a hyena.This is an incredible movie. Some would say elements of the story are too fantastic to be believable but, with the first film in The Hobbit trilogy and the alleged final chapter in the Twilight saga currently in theaters, those objections seem hollow, to say the least. The struggle between man and beast and the eventual development of a symbiotic relationship between the two make for an extremely gripping tale. It's made even more so by the trials and tribulations they both encounter in their fight to survive. I thoroughly enjoyed Life of Pi, and wish I'd seen it sooner.",5,Wondrous,1359849600,"02 3, 2013",2013,2409,"['What', 'would', 'do', 'found', 'orphaned', 'alone', 'middle', 'ocean', 'Drown', 'surrender', 'pray', 'Now', 'imagine', 'had', 'company', 'form', 'dangerous', 'predator.We', 'join', 'story', 'Piscine', 'Molitor', 'Patel', 'adulthood', 'Piscine', 'known', 'Pi', 'played', 'Irfan', 'Khan', 'Indian', 'living', 'Canada', 'One', 'day', 'young', 'novelist', 'door', 'being', 'referred', 'friend', 'Named', 'swimming', 'pool', 'parents', 'Piscine', 'came', 'nickname', 'exhaustive', 'chiding', 'given', 'name', 'classmates', 'school', 'father', 'ran', 'local', 'zoo', 'Pi', 'took', 'intense', 'as', 'far', 'father', 'was', 'concerned', 'unhealthy', 'interest', 'zoo', 'sole', 'tiger', 'Named', 'Richard', 'Parker', 'result', 'clerical', 'error', 'tiger', 'fed', 'live', 'goat', 'Pi', 'witness', 'effort', 'father', 'instill', 'appropriate', 'amount', 'fear', 'Though', 'raised', 'Hindu', 'Pi', 'played', 'adolescent', 'Ayush', 'Tandon', 'Christianity', 'result', 'dare', 'older', 'brother', 'sheer', 'chance', 'discovers', 'Islam', 'sometime', 'adult', 'Catholic', 'Hindu', '16', 'Pi', 'father', 'close', 'zoo', 'sell', 'animals', 'move', 'family', 'Canada', 'crushing', 'development', 'life', 'main', 'character', 'just', 'fallen', 'love', 'first', 'time', 'family', 'animals', 'make', 'journey', 'west', 'Japanese', 'freighter', 'Woken', 'severe', 'storm', 'Pi', 'top', 'deck', 'marvel', 'magnitude', 'waves', 'wind', 'rain', 'extremely', 'questionable', 'decision', 'lifeboat', 'family', 'rest', 'crew', 'sink', 'ship', 'would', 'make', 'chances', 'survival', 'slim', 'enough', 'better', 'worse', 'not', 'alone', 'boat', 'Richard', 'Parker', 'tiger', 'orangutan', 'Orange', 'Juice', 'zebra', 'hyena.This', 'incredible', 'movie', 'would', 'say', 'elements', 'story', 'are', 'too', 'fantastic', 'be', 'believable', 'first', 'film', 'Hobbit', 'trilogy', 'alleged', 'final', 'chapter', 'Twilight', 'saga', 'currently', 'theaters', 'objections', 'seem', 'hollow', 'say', 'least', 'struggle', 'man', 'beast', 'eventual', 'development', 'symbiotic', 'relationship', 'two', 'make', 'extremely', 'gripping', 'tale', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'encounter', 'fight', 'survive', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'Life', 'Pi', 'wish', ""'d"", 'seen', 'sooner']",N/A

1486763,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B005LAIIHG,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 5]","I was interested in Ang Lee's new film ""Life of Pi"" not because of the director (though I really like his films especially ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""), but because of the actor in it. Some film fans might remember the name of Irrfan Khan, who played a police inspector interrogating the protagonist of Danny Boyle's ""Slumdog Millionaire.""In this film adaptation of a Booker Prize-winner Yann Martel's novel of the same title, Irrfan Khan plays an adult ""Pi"" Patel living in Canada, who is being interviewed by a writer (Rafe Spall replacing Tobey Maguire). In the flashbacks that follow, Pi recounts why he came to called Pi; and how he survived a shipwreck and the subsequent 227 days on a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger named ""Richard Parker.""People would watch this movie with different expectations. What you get is its beautiful photography by Claudio Miranda (""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"") and comfortable background score by Mychael Danna. The cast is all very good, including a newcomer Suraj Sharma as young 16-year-old Pi Patel.And there is a story that is beautifully told. While Ang Lee deftly keeps the narrative flowing with rich visuals, however, we are constantly made aware that, well-told as it is, this is just a ""story."" The film's brief third act, where we are asked to choose between two alternatives, makes me feel that even a talented player like Irrfan Khan cannot make the film's brief conclusion concerning power of storytelling (or whatever philosophical theme you might find) convincing or moving.You will be asked: ""Which do you prefer?"" I might ask: ""What if we are not free to choose?"" The boy's 227-day journey with the tiger is so absorbing that the answer is already made. Even if you don't notice who the ""Richard Parker"" is (no, not a comic book character; there are more than one, real-life and fictional), you would most likely to choose the same one as ""the writer"" does. As some reviewers have pointed out, the presence of the tiger suggests something more complicated and even sinister, which the film tries to gloss over.I am not saying ""Life of Pi"" is not worth watching. There is a good reason why some people say that the film is a triumph of storytelling. Still, I cannot help feeling that some stories are better left to the imagination, especially when those stories should be open to our interpretation.",3,(3.5 STARS) Incredible Story Beautifully Told ...

1486764,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B005LAIIHG,Turfseer,"[68, 89]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Rating: 3.5 out of 5.0Is 'Life of Pi' meant as a story of great spiritual uplift--or a different story altogether--something more morose and sinister? Director Ang Lee, proffers up a twist ending where the film's protagonist, the young Pi Patel, has his amazing tale of survival called into question and replaced by an equally fantastic tale, albeit far less spiritually uplifting, than the first.The film begins with a now grown Patel, residing in Canada and working as a professor. Patel's relates his life to an aspiring writer in three parts: 1) his childhood and adolescence with his family in India; 2) his life as a castaway in a lifeboat with the tiger, 'Richard Parker'; and 3) the climax of his survivor story which includes an alternative story to the one he's just related. Unfortunately, Lee must rely on a narrator, the elder Patel, to tell a good part of the story. This is off-putting (particularly during the denouement), since the stodgy conversations between the professor and the writer, can't hold a candle to the magnificent visual scenes established with the younger Pi (played by brilliant newcomer, Suraj Sharma) as he fights for survival on the high seas.The first third of the 'Life of Pi' is slow-moving. Pi's upbringing is quite unusual in one respect: his father owns a zoo. Otherwise Pi is presented as a sensitive but quirky kid who evinces a spiritual side, even at an early age. Pi's spirituality comes into play later, when his alternative story, presents him in a decidedly less pacifistic light.Perhaps the most significant scene in the first third of the movie is when Pi's father forces him to watch Richard Parker devour a goat. Pi's 'loss of innocence' foreshadows his ultimate test, when he later comes face to face with Richard Parker in the boat. How does the tiger manage to pull the goat into his side of the cell? The apparent unrealistic and perplexing scene may suggest, on the other hand, that Patel's story is either whole or part fantasy.The meat and potatoes of the 'Life of Pi' is the young man's incredible story of survival after his parents are killed, during the sinking of the Japanese freighter. 'Life of Pi' fascinates, when we see how Pi manages to cope with a tiger in his lifeboat. Before Richard Parker becomes the center of Pi's attention, two other animals, a zebra and orangutan are killed by an hyena, who in turn is killed by Richard Parker. The animals' demise takes on a symbolic meaning later on, when Pi proffers up the second story in the Third Act. The sudden disappearance of the three animals from the boat, once again suggests that perhaps Pi's story belongs in the realm of fantasy.Ang Lee proves his mastery as a director of special effects, since most of the tiger sequences were created through the wizardry of computer generated images. From his inventiveness to creating a small raft of flotation devices to keep a safe distance from the tiger and the way in which he goes about finding food after a whale destroys his food stocks, the story of Pi and Richard Parker proves quite absorbing. The taming of the tiger is the high point of Pi's 'man versus nature' saga before the Second Act crisis.The crisis occurs when Pi lands on the 'bionic' island. Again, the island appears to symbolize Pi's crisis in the alternative reality the elder Pi relates to the writer in the Third Act. Once Pi discovers that the island's water turns acidic at night and is devouring fish, as well as a tooth in a carnivorous plant, he concludes that he'll die if he remains on the island.The elder Patel finally reveals that his castaway story might merely be a 'coping mechanism'. Patel reveals that he told Japanese investigators of the possibility that what 'might' have happened was that he ended up in a lifeboat with his mother, a sailor with a broken leg and a crew member who his father had a disagreeable encounter earlier on, before the freighter sunk. The crew member ends up killing the sailor and his mother after his mother puts him on a raft. Patel returns to kill the crew member. The fight with the crew member recalls the tooth he finds in the plant on the island. Leaving the island might be symbolic of his decision to leave the situation where he found himself observing how his mother was thrown to the sharks. And finally, when Richard Parker fails to turn back and acknowledge him, this jarring event symbolizes Pi's acceptance of a loss of innocence and the reality that Story #1 was a fantasy.There are hints that Story #2 may have been worse than Pi initially lets on. Was Pi possibly guilty of cannibalism? It's interesting that there was an actual Richard Parker in the 19th century who was a victim of cannibalism after a shipwreck and the character's name also figures in an Edgar Allan Poe novel, again a victim of cannibalism at sea.Ang Lee, as well as author Martel, have made it clear that they both prefer Pi's spiritually uplifting tale of survival to the downbeat one involving murder. The elder Patel makes his preference clear in the film itself. The second story appears to be thrown in to contrast it with the uplifting message of Story #1. Story #2 then perhaps becomes a cautionary tale--similar to the loss of innocence moment when Richard Parker kills the goat. Lee has no problem with such ambiguity as long as the feel good message is highlighted.In the end, the Life of Pi 'main course' will be remembered for Pi's 'story #1' and Ang Lee's masterful visual presentation. The rest, including the lumbering narration, simplistic spiritual stance and ambiguous alternative ending, are the leftovers.",3,2nd Act shines; 1st & 3rd Acts not as much due to dependence on

1486786,A2XOS0D485JSMM,B005LAIIHG,webhawk50,"[3, 4]","The story of The Life of Pi is relatively simple and yet, rather profound as well.  The basic story revolves around Pi, the main character, relating his story to a writer, about his experiences relating to a journey taken in a lifeboat with his &#34;friends&#34; after a storm destroyed the ship he was on with his family while journeying to America.  Since describing this film with too much detail in a review would rob another of the opportunity to simply experience this movie, I don't really want to say much more here.  Besides, if you really want to know, simply go to one of the movie review sites.  I just want to give my own general impressions here without the detail.There are many who have found The Life of Pi either tedious and over-long or else object to the over-emphasis on &#34;religion&#34; and spirituality.  While I never found it tedious or dull, I did not buy into the &#34;spiritual&#34; bent of the movie either.  But you don't have to &#34;buy-in&#34; to that aspect of the movie in order to enjoy it.  After all, you are an observer and a fellow traveler with Pi and his &#34;boat-mate(s)&#34;. Again, it is the experience that counts here; not that you have to agree with the beliefs of the main character.Let me just say here that I am a wannabe 3D artist.  The 3D CG work in this film surpasses anything I have seen to date, including Avatar which I also loved.  I've enjoyed many other 3D works such as Toy Story, etc, but The Life of Pi is, as they say, in a league all it's own when it comes to the CG work.  I simply would not have believed this depth of realism was even possible and I'm directly involved in it!  It is this very sense of realism that brings this film to life and puts you in the boat and elsewhere with Pi.  Absolutely masterful work.The Life of Pi is rated PG.  I have raised 5 kids and I don't think I would want to bring younger kids to this movie.  It is simply too intense for most younger children, in my opinion.  I really think that PG13 would have probably been more appropriate.  That, of course, depends on the maturity of each child.  Some younger kids could handle it just fine.  Like all such things, you've just got to know your kids.  Just be warned before plunking one of your little ones down in front of this.The Life of Pi is not a perfect film and certainly has it's flaws.  I found the ending particularly confusing and even a bit frustrating. I won't tell you why because that would give too much away.  But for me, at least, that was it's greatest and most serious flaw.  Yes, the religious mumbo jumbo was a little much sometimes.  Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  It provided me with a movie-going experience that I will never forget.  I can't say that about too many films any more.",5,An incredible experience and a stunning film!,1365811200,"04 13, 2013",2013,2777,"['story', 'Life', 'Pi', 'relatively', 'simple', 'yet', 'rather', 'profound', 'as', 'well', 'basic', 'story', 'revolves', 'Pi', 'main', 'character', 'relating', 'story', 'writer', 'experiences', 'relating', 'journey', 'taken', 'lifeboat', '34', 'friends', '34', 'storm', 'destroyed', 'ship', 'was', 'family', 'journeying', 'America', 'describing', 'film', 'too', 'much', 'detail', 'review', 'would', 'rob', 'opportunity', 'simply', 'experience', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'say', 'much', 'more', 'here', 'Besides', 'really', 'want', 'know', 'simply', 'go', 'one', 'movie', 'review', 'sites', 'just', 'want', 'give', 'own', 'general', 'impressions', 'here', 'are', 'many', 'who', 'have', 'found', 'Life', 'Pi', 'tedious', 'over-long', 'else', 'object', 'over-emphasis', '34', 'religion', '34', 'spirituality', 'never', 'found', 'tedious', 'dull', 'did', 'not', 'buy', '34', 'spiritual', '34', 'bent', 'movie', 'either', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', '34', 'buy-in', '34', 'aspect', 'movie', 'order', 'enjoy', 'are', 'observer', 'fellow', 'traveler', 'Pi', '34', 'boat-mate', 's', '34', 'Again', 'experience', 'here', 'not', 'have', 'agree', 'beliefs', 'main', 'character.Let', 'just', 'say', 'here', 'am', 'wannabe', '3D', 'artist', '3D', 'CG', 'work', 'film', 'anything', 'have', 'seen', 'date', 'including', 'Avatar', 'also', 'loved', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'many', 'other', '3D', 'works', 'such', 'Toy', 'Story', 'etc', 'Life', 'Pi', 'say', 'league', 'own', 'when', 'CG', 'work', 'simply', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'believed', 'depth', 'realism', 'was', 'even', 'possible', ""'m"", 'directly', 'involved', 'very', 'sense', 'realism', 'film', 'life', 'boat', 'elsewhere', 'Pi', 'Absolutely', 'masterful', 'work.The', 'Life', 'Pi', 'rated', 'PG', 'have', 'raised', '5', 'kids', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'want', 'bring', 'younger', 'kids', 'movie', 'simply', 'too', 'intense', 'most', 'younger', 'children', 'opinion', 'really', 'think', 'PG13', 'would', 'have', 'probably', 'been', 'more', 'appropriate', 'course', 'maturity', 'child', 'younger', 'kids', 'could', 'handle', 'just', 'fine', 'such', 'things', ""'ve"", 'just', 'got', 'know', 'kids', 'Just', 'be', 'warned', 'plunking', 'one', 'little', 'ones', 'down', 'front', 'this.The', 'Life', 'Pi', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'certainly', 'flaws', 'found', 'ending', 'particularly', 'confusing', 'even', 'bit', 'frustrating', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'why', 'would', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'least', 'was', 'greatest', 'most', 'serious', 'flaw', 'Yes', 'religious', 'mumbo', 'jumbo', 'was', 'little', 'much', 'sometimes', 'Nevertheless', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'provided', 'movie-going', 'experience', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'about', 'too', 'many', 'films', 'more']",N/A

That's not a criticism - a sense of wonder and something beyond appears all too seldom in mainstream movies.Really, this can only be understood in its final moments. Moving forward, we see a young man desperate for something to believe in, taking a cafetria approach to Hinduism, Catholicism, and Islam, trying to feed his hungry soul from the smorgasbord. Then, the catastrophe at sea lands him in a life boat with a small managerie. Oddly, the different beasts appear at different times, despite the boat's small size and dubious hiding places. The largest part of the movie describes his uneasy standoff with Richard Parker, the only other survivor, as supplies run out and conditions worsen. Finally Pi (the protagonist) finds land, and is saved - and Richard Parker disappears. As the only survivor, he's the center of interest for insurance investigators trying to understand the wreck.Under their merciless interrogation, Pi's story suddenly changes - and changes everything that had gone before. His deep and wide sense of belief falls into place, the whole time at sea takes new meaning, Richard Parker becomes both less and more than he'd been all along, and even his childhood feat of memorizing mathematical pi (3.14 etc) to hundreds of places earns a new understanding.And, when everything in the story changes, perhaps the viewer changes too - I know I did.-- wiredweird",5,Cryptic but beautiful,1354838400,"12 7, 2012",2012,1516,"['went', 'movie', 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'was', 'getting', 'not', 'having', 'read', 'book', 'came', 'out', 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'had', 'gotten', 'not', 'criticism', 'sense', 'wonder', 'something', 'too', 'seldom', 'mainstream', 'movies.Really', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'understood', 'final', 'moments', 'Moving', 'forward', 'see', 'young', 'man', 'desperate', 'something', 'believe', 'taking', 'cafetria', 'approach', 'Hinduism', 'Catholicism', 'Islam', 'trying', 'feed', 'hungry', 'soul', 'smorgasbord', 'Then', 'catastrophe', 'sea', 'life', 'boat', 'small', 'managerie', 'Oddly', 'different', 'beasts', 'appear', 'different', 'times', 'boat', 'small', 'size', 'dubious', 'hiding', 'places', 'largest', 'part', 'movie', 'uneasy', 'standoff', 'Richard', 'Parker', 'only', 'other', 'survivor', 'supplies', 'run', 'out', 'conditions', 'worsen', 'Finally', 'Pi', 'protagonist', 'land', 'saved', 'Richard', 'Parker', 'only', 'survivor', 'center', 'interest', 'insurance', 'investigators', 'trying', 'understand', 'wreck.Under', 'merciless', 'interrogation', 'Pi', 'story', 'suddenly', 'changes', 'everything', 'had', 'gone', 'before', 'deep', 'wide', 'sense', 'belief', 'falls', 'place', 'whole', 'time', 'sea', 'new', 'meaning', 'Richard', 'Parker', 'less', 'more', ""'d"", 'been', 'along', 'even', 'childhood', 'feat', 'memorizing', 'mathematical', 'pi', '3.14', 'etc', 'hundreds', 'places', 'earns', 'new', 'understanding.And', 'when', 'everything', 'story', 'changes', 'perhaps', 'viewer', 'changes', 'too', 'know', 'did.', 'wiredweird']",N/A

We watched it with our eight-year-old who also enjoyed the visual splendor of the movie. It is a great film because it combines the best of two worlds - excellent movie-making, thanks to Ang Lee's masterful direction, and a compelling storyline.The cast is another revelation. I was happy to see some of my favorite South Asian Indie actors such as Irrfan Khan and Tabu in this production. Irrfan Khan has been in other productions such asThe NamesakeandSlumdog Millionaire.Khan plays the adult Pi who is visited by a novelist referred by Mama-ji, Pi's uncle. Mama-ji believes Pi's life story is worthy of being novelized and so begins the story, narrated by the adult Pi.The child Pi is played by Ayush Tandon whose full name, Piscine Molitor Patel, opens him to incessant teasing by his fellow classmates. Nevertheless, Pi's natural intelligence and curiosity thrives and he is particularly interested in the idea of God - who or what is God, and where can God be found? There are some interesting, even comical scenes of the young Pi shown practicing the various religions he learns about - Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam. Yet instead of scolding him, his wise father cautions Pi, and advises him to always approach things by way of reason.Suraj Sharma portrays the 16-year-old Pi who is shown to be still in search of answers pertaining to the fundamental questions in life. Pi's chance to ""find God"" comes when he is shipwrecked on a lifeboat together with an adult Bengal tiger. The question is: Is this reality or is it Pi's imagination working on overdrive?The movie unfolds with such grace and beauty that it literally took my breath away. Questions of faith and survival under the most trying circumstances are explored with such depth and Lee's assured direction brings out the best in his cast, especially the young Suraj Sharma who is simply amazing in this film. His performance is raw and visceral, and some of the most compelling scenes in the film are in his interactions with the adult Bengal tiger. Though the tiger is part of CGI, Richard Parker (the tiger's name) was very real to me, and the chemistry between Pi and Richard Parker was very credible.This is one of the most unique films I have watched in a long time and I love it for so many reasons - it brought the novel alive for me and exceeded my expectations, it showed me that good storytelling does not have to suffer in a film loaded with CGI, and that an unknown actor can still carry a movie!",5,"A visual feast and compelling, masterful storytelling",1356480000,"12 26, 2012",2012,2582,"['movie', 'adaptation', 'Yann', ""Martel'sLife"", 'Piis', 'sublime', 'movie', 'even', 'picky', 'husband', 'loved', 'watched', 'eight-year-old', 'who', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'visual', 'splendor', 'movie', 'great', 'film', 'best', 'two', 'worlds', 'excellent', 'movie-making', 'thanks', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'masterful', 'direction', 'compelling', 'storyline.The', 'cast', 'revelation', 'was', 'happy', 'see', 'favorite', 'South', 'Asian', 'Indie', 'actors', 'such', 'Irrfan', 'Khan', 'Tabu', 'production', 'Irrfan', 'Khan', 'been', 'other', 'productions', 'such', 'asThe', 'NamesakeandSlumdog', 'Millionaire.Khan', 'adult', 'Pi', 'who', 'visited', 'novelist', 'referred', 'Mama-ji', 'Pi', 'uncle', 'Mama-ji', 'Pi', 'life', 'story', 'worthy', 'being', 'novelized', 'so', 'story', 'narrated', 'adult', 'Pi.The', 'child', 'Pi', 'played', 'Ayush', 'Tandon', 'full', 'name', 'Piscine', 'Molitor', 'Patel', 'incessant', 'teasing', 'fellow', 'classmates', 'Nevertheless', 'Pi', 'natural', 'intelligence', 'curiosity', 'thrives', 'particularly', 'interested', 'idea', 'God', 'who', 'what', 'God', 'where', 'can', 'God', 'be', 'found', 'are', 'interesting', 'even', 'comical', 'scenes', 'young', 'Pi', 'shown', 'practicing', 'various', 'religions', 'Hinduism', 'Christianity', 'Islam', 'instead', 'scolding', 'wise', 'father', 'cautions', 'Pi', 'always', 'approach', 'things', 'way', 'reason.Suraj', 'Sharma', '16-year-old', 'Pi', 'who', 'shown', 'be', 'still', 'search', 'answers', 'pertaining', 'fundamental', 'questions', 'life', 'Pi', 'chance', 'find', 'God', 'when', 'shipwrecked', 'lifeboat', 'together', 'adult', 'Bengal', 'tiger', 'question', 'reality', 'Pi', 'imagination', 'working', 'overdrive', 'movie', 'such', 'grace', 'beauty', 'literally', 'took', 'breath', 'away', 'Questions', 'faith', 'survival', 'most', 'trying', 'circumstances', 'are', 'explored', 'such', 'depth', 'Lee', 'assured', 'direction', 'out', 'best', 'cast', 'especially', 'young', 'Suraj', 'Sharma', 'who', 'simply', 'amazing', 'film', 'performance', 'raw', 'visceral', 'most', 'compelling', 'scenes', 'film', 'are', 'interactions', 'adult', 'Bengal', 'tiger', 'tiger', 'part', 'CGI', 'Richard', 'Parker', 'tiger', 'name', 'was', 'very', 'real', 'chemistry', 'Pi', 'Richard', 'Parker', 'was', 'very', 'credible.This', 'one', 'most', 'unique', 'films', 'have', 'watched', 'long', 'time', 'love', 'so', 'many', 'reasons', 'brought', 'novel', 'alive', 'exceeded', 'expectations', 'showed', 'good', 'storytelling', 'not', 'have', 'suffer', 'film', 'loaded', 'CGI', 'unknown', 'actor', 'can', 'still', 'carry', 'movie']",N/A
