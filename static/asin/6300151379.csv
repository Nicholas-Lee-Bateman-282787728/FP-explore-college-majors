(the script was written by Terry Jones)I have loved this movie ever since I was a little kid. My parents introduced it to me at a young age. I was riveted by the...interesting Goblins and the creepy-cool storyline about a girl who unknowingly gives up her baby brother to the Goblins. When she finds out what has happened, it is up to her to save her brother from the Goblin King. But it won't be easy. To stop her, the Goblin King (David Bowie) sets before her a challenge. If she solves the Labyrinth (A giant maze where there are basically no rules) in nine hours, she gets her brother back. If not...well, let's just say that the Goblins will have a new family member. You'll be absolutely amazed by this film.

Sarah represents everyone, getting forced to face their own maze of the mind to find peace, learning that growing up means more growing inward, letting go of pettiness than necessarily relinquishing what one loves.  The music, except for Chilly Down, is excellent. Even if you can't stand David Bowie music, Underground, As the World falls down, Magic Dance, and Within you will win your heart.

A young Jennifer Connelly was starring in her first trippin' film, preparing the way for ""Requiem for a Dream"",""Dark City"" and ""A Beautiful Mind.""

She calls on goblins to take him away;Jareth (David Bowie),the Goblin King,obliges. Suddenly, Sarah regrets her decision&must; venture through a labyrinth to save Toby. ""Labyrinth"" has more mature themes than children might realize (but it's kid-friendly)There seems to be a mutual attraction between Sarah&Jareth.; David Bowie plays Jareth ambiguously,as a seducer,a friend,a villain,and a father figure. He even injects some glam rock into the movie. There's a Freudian quality to Jareth&Sarah;'s relationship. Jareth's final speech is quite moving,since he tells Sarah all he wanted to do was please her.He comes across as an unrequited lover. The conclusion is rather strange;Sarah rejoices with her friends from the Labyrinth. One can say she has reconciled everyday life with her fantasy life.""Labyrinth"" stands as a timeless fantasy masterpiece.

197126,AK0CENM3LUM28,6300151379,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","Labyrinth / B00000K3D4*Spoilers*It seems like just last week I was reviewingThe Dark Crystaland hailing it as a timeless classic adventure, enjoyable for both children and adults. Having just also seen ""Labyrinth"", which is often packaged together with ""The Dark Crystal"", I have to say that, though I enjoyed ""Labyrinth"", it isn't a timeless classic for all ages in the way that ""The Dark Crystal"" is.In an ominous foretelling of Lucas' now much-lamented propensity to prefer attractive young actors/actresses as opposed to ones who are skilled at their craft, lead actress Connelly, seems ill at ease here, often pausing excessively long as her lines are (apparently) fed to her and providing the same blank expressionless face repeatedly. The scenes between her and the Goblin King (Bowie) are often charged with sexual tension that is, in my opinion, largely inappropriate, and can someone please explain why they felt the need to dress Bowie in skin-tight tights with an accompanying jutting cup in his nether region?Someone also felt the need to include music that can only be described as ""very eighties"" and while none of it is bad, one really does not make a ""timeless classic"" by slapping a music genre like this on it - an action which invariably dates it.Once you get past the over-sexualized, under-achieving Connelly and maintain eye-contact only with the suggestive Bowie, things improve. The labyrinth is intriguing and amusing, with its hidden doors, moving passageways, loose stones, and excessive traps. The theme is a little more specialized than some (saving a brother as opposed to saving the world), but is something that will resonate with children - particularly children with a younger sibling, I suspect. The supporting muppets are superb, with an over-sized Yeti (""Smells bad!""), a quixotic fox (riding an adorable doggie), and a troll who dares to hope that the lovely Connelly will be his friend in spite of his ugly face. (Again, though, this is a little creepy, with the troll receiving a much-anticipated spontaneous kiss from Connelly, albeit of the friendly 'on-the-cheek' variety.) And, of course, the crystal ball juggling featured throughout the movie has to be seen to be believed, along with a hallway mirroring the famous M.C. Escher stairwell painting.I don't regret watching ""Labyrinth"", and I think children may appreciate the movie for the bright colors and fun music, but definitely the movie is lacking the strong heroine, good acting, and overall appeal of ""The Dark Crystal"". I definitely would have liked the movie much better with a more decent actress and a lessening of the sexuality overtones that someone, I suspect Lucas, thought was a good idea to include.~ Ana Mardoll",4,"Decent, but Dated",1243814400,"06 1, 2009",2009,2726,"['Labyrinth', '/', 'B00000K3D4*Spoilers*It', 'just', 'last', 'week', 'was', 'reviewingThe', 'Dark', 'Crystaland', 'hailing', 'timeless', 'classic', 'adventure', 'enjoyable', 'children', 'adults', 'Having', 'just', 'also', 'seen', 'Labyrinth', 'often', 'packaged', 'together', 'Dark', 'Crystal', 'have', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'Labyrinth', ""n't"", 'timeless', 'classic', 'ages', 'way', 'Dark', 'Crystal', 'is.In', 'ominous', 'foretelling', 'Lucas', 'now', 'much-lamented', 'propensity', 'prefer', 'attractive', 'young', 'actors/actresses', 'opposed', 'ones', 'who', 'are', 'skilled', 'craft', 'lead', 'actress', 'Connelly', 'ill', 'ease', 'here', 'often', 'pausing', 'excessively', 'long', 'lines', 'are', 'apparently', 'fed', 'providing', 'same', 'blank', 'expressionless', 'face', 'repeatedly', 'scenes', 'Goblin', 'King', 'Bowie', 'are', 'often', 'charged', 'sexual', 'tension', 'opinion', 'largely', 'inappropriate', 'can', 'someone', 'please', 'explain', 'why', 'felt', 'need', 'dress', 'Bowie', 'skin-tight', 'tights', 'accompanying', 'jutting', 'cup', 'region', 'Someone', 'also', 'felt', 'need', 'include', 'music', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'very', 'eighties', 'none', 'bad', 'one', 'really', 'not', 'make', 'timeless', 'classic', 'slapping', 'music', 'genre', 'action', 'invariably', 'it.Once', 'get', 'over-sexualized', 'under-achieving', 'Connelly', 'maintain', 'eye-contact', 'only', 'suggestive', 'Bowie', 'things', 'improve', 'labyrinth', 'intriguing', 'amusing', 'hidden', 'doors', 'moving', 'passageways', 'loose', 'stones', 'excessive', 'traps', 'theme', 'little', 'more', 'specialized', 'saving', 'brother', 'opposed', 'saving', 'world', 'something', 'will', 'resonate', 'children', 'particularly', 'children', 'younger', 'sibling', 'suspect', 'supporting', 'muppets', 'are', 'superb', 'over-sized', 'Yeti', 'Smells', 'bad', 'quixotic', 'fox', 'riding', 'adorable', 'doggie', 'troll', 'who', 'hope', 'lovely', 'Connelly', 'will', 'be', 'friend', 'spite', 'ugly', 'face', 'Again', 'though', 'little', 'creepy', 'troll', 'receiving', 'much-anticipated', 'spontaneous', 'kiss', 'Connelly', 'albeit', 'friendly', ""'on-the-cheek"", 'variety', 'course', 'crystal', 'ball', 'juggling', 'featured', 'movie', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed', 'hallway', 'mirroring', 'famous', 'M.C', 'Escher', 'stairwell', 'painting.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'regret', 'watching', 'Labyrinth', 'think', 'children', 'may', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'bright', 'colors', 'fun', 'music', 'definitely', 'movie', 'lacking', 'strong', 'heroine', 'good', 'acting', 'overall', 'appeal', 'Dark', 'Crystal', 'definitely', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'movie', 'much', 'better', 'more', 'decent', 'actress', 'lessening', 'sexuality', 'someone', 'suspect', 'Lucas', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'idea', 'include.~', 'Ana', 'Mardoll']",N/A

I remember in my early teens hearing from some friends how this was their favorite `fantasy' film and that I should watch it.  I've never been much for fantasy films, so I was never inclined to dig in, but I recently gave this is watch and I must say that the cult following is baffling.  I see absolutely nothing of merit here, and it's sad because it was obviously trying to capitalize off of the success of 1984's `The Neverending Story', a fantasy film that works on nearly all levels.  Where `The Neverending Story' used spiritual overtones to create something dark and profound, and where `The Princess Bride' used comic highlights to create something universally appealing and wholly entertaining, `Labyrinth' fails to do much of anything at all.  Instead, it becomes a campy mess, attempting darkness but coming off like a depressing episode of Sesame Street complete with ridiculous musical numbers and a dreadful David Bowie in too tight pants and atrocious hair.  The Muppets are all laughably poor in construction and the redundancy and pointlessness of the plot is enough to put you to sleep.  This isn't even fun, for it fails to bring a smile that isn't awkward.

197141,ABSX5TGEGRH76,6300151379,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[9, 14]","While I am in no way a huge fan, I do like the works of Jim Henson.  The Muppets are hilarious, and I have fond memories of Fraggle Rock.  I had always meant to see this movie, but I could never get around to it.  In addition to what I'd always heard as fantastic effects and puppetry, it has Jennifer Connelly in it (so beautiful, even at 16).  My roommate has it, so I finally sat down and watched it.  He had constantly praised it, so I was expecting a great, quirky, imaginitive film that would be good for an hour and a half of escapism.  Well, it is quirky.Connelly plays Sarah, a 16-year-old girl who is happier playing with her toys and pretending to be a princess than be around kids her own age.  She is very smart, but somewhat socially stunted (or at least that's the impression I got).  When her parents ask her to babysit her little brother Toby (Toby Froud), she goes off the deep end, complaining how it will take up too much of her time.  She wishes that the goblins will come and take him away, absolving her of responisbility.  When the wish comes true, she pleads with the goblin king Jareth (David Bowie) to get him back.  He agrees to return Toby to her if she can navigate his enormous labyrinth in less than 13 hours.Soon, Sarah is off exploring a fantasy world populated by goblins, talking worms, and a whole manner of bizarre creatures.  Like the tagline says, nothing is what it seems and anything is possible.  Anything goes in the labyrinth.  Think Alice in Wonderland mixed with the muppets, and hopped up on LSD.  Yeah, it's that strange.  Some things work very well.  Others don't.  There's a scene where Sarah encounters these creatures that can remove their own heads, and while it looks marginally cool, it in no way advances the plot.  Also, there is a plot point that references a scene from Snow White (you'll know it when you see it), and she is able to recover from the event without explanation.  Finally, the ending is the biggest cop-out I've ever seen.  It was pointless and did not fit at all with the rest of the movie.Labyrinth is visually stunning.  The puppets, the sets, and the costumes are all great.  The choreography is wonderful, especially since most of the ""actors"" are puppets.  Sadly, the story just isn't there.  There was so much potential; there are many movies that can appeal to both kids and adults, and while this should have been going for both audiences, it really only applies to kids.  Kids, for the most part, will love this (unless they're easily scared), while adults will marvel at the look at the film but will roll their eyes at many of the plot points and dialogue.",3,"Good For Younger Kids, But Not Sure For Adults...",1130803200,"11 1, 2005",2005,2643,"['am', 'way', 'huge', 'fan', 'do', 'works', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'Muppets', 'are', 'hilarious', 'have', 'fond', 'memories', 'Fraggle', 'Rock', 'had', 'always', 'meant', 'see', 'movie', 'could', 'never', 'get', 'addition', 'what', ""'d"", 'always', 'heard', 'fantastic', 'effects', 'puppetry', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'so', 'beautiful', 'even', '16', 'roommate', 'so', 'finally', 'sat', 'down', 'watched', 'had', 'constantly', 'praised', 'was', 'expecting', 'great', 'quirky', 'imaginitive', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'hour', 'half', 'escapism', 'Well', 'quirky.Connelly', 'plays', 'Sarah', '16-year-old', 'girl', 'who', 'happier', 'playing', 'toys', 'pretending', 'be', 'princess', 'be', 'around', 'kids', 'own', 'age', 'very', 'smart', 'somewhat', 'socially', 'stunted', 'least', 'impression', 'got', 'When', 'parents', 'ask', 'babysit', 'little', 'brother', 'Toby', 'Toby', 'Froud', 'deep', 'end', 'complaining', 'how', 'will', 'take', 'up', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'goblins', 'will', 'come', 'take', 'away', 'absolving', 'responisbility', 'When', 'wish', 'true', 'goblin', 'king', 'Jareth', 'David', 'Bowie', 'get', 'back', 'return', 'Toby', 'can', 'navigate', 'enormous', 'labyrinth', 'less', '13', 'hours.Soon', 'Sarah', 'exploring', 'fantasy', 'world', 'populated', 'goblins', 'talking', 'worms', 'whole', 'manner', 'bizarre', 'creatures', 'tagline', 'nothing', 'what', 'anything', 'possible', 'Anything', 'labyrinth', 'Think', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'mixed', 'muppets', 'hopped', 'up', 'LSD', 'Yeah', 'strange', 'things', 'work', 'very', 'well', 'Others', 'do', ""n't"", 'scene', 'where', 'Sarah', 'creatures', 'can', 'remove', 'own', 'heads', 'marginally', 'cool', 'way', 'plot', 'Also', 'plot', 'point', 'scene', 'Snow', 'White', ""'ll"", 'know', 'when', 'see', 'able', 'recover', 'event', 'explanation', 'Finally', 'ending', 'biggest', 'cop-out', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'was', 'pointless', 'did', 'not', 'fit', 'rest', 'movie.Labyrinth', 'visually', 'stunning', 'puppets', 'sets', 'costumes', 'are', 'great', 'choreography', 'wonderful', 'especially', 'most', 'actors', 'are', 'puppets', 'Sadly', 'story', 'just', ""n't"", 'there', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'are', 'many', 'movies', 'can', 'appeal', 'kids', 'adults', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'going', 'audiences', 'really', 'only', 'kids', 'Kids', 'most', 'part', 'will', 'love', ""'re"", 'easily', 'scared', 'adults', 'will', 'marvel', 'look', 'film', 'will', 'roll', 'eyes', 'many', 'plot', 'points', 'dialogue']",N/A

I have the original release of the DVD and didn't bother getting any of the more recent collector edition or fancy dvds that came out recently so I can't compare to those.The movie is the same, but much higher qualitiy, you can really see all of the glitter that sparkles all over the labyrinth, its wide screened so you can see that much more of the world (and the elusive treasures in Sarah's room, aka the Goblin King doll).The DVD is in a slip case, which has a holographic type cover (oh yes, its that cool).  The first DVD has the movie along with a track of commentary by Brian Froud.  Having listened to it I found it pretty interesting, since he was involved in the entire creative process he had a lot of background information on how certain things came about, though sadly no on set anicdotes (except for a few which are related to Toby)  since he didn't witness alot of the filming.  It would have been nice to have another track with some of the muppeteers, Brian Henson, Kevin Clash, Karen Prell etc.The second disc has the old documentary on the making of the movie, which was on the previous DVDs.  It also has 2 new documentaries.  Both have interviews (new) with Froud (Brian and Toby) Gates McFadden, Brian Henson (very insightful), Karen Prell, Dave Goelz, George Lucas (very interesting, I was surprised he did this actually)  and several others that were involved in the making of the movie.  With in these new features there are some new behind the scenes footage, screen tests, but what I was really dissapointed in...In the MirrorMask coffee table book it was mentioned how Neil Gaimen and Dave McKean mentioned how when staying in Jim Henson's home in England they found a nearly six hour version of the Labyrinth and used it as a sort of spring board for their own creative process.  I wanted to see some of that six hours, to see some cut scenes, extended scenes, outtakes.  It sounded when the press release for this first came out that it would have some of that in it...sadly no.But it is still enjoyable enough to get.

There is something magical about watching Labyrinth. You just feel the happiness that rubs off from this movie. It almost makes you wish you were a kid again.  I am not even a David Bowie fan but I can't help but smile whenever he starts singing (which is quite often). What is fantastic about the way the film opens and closes as that it really hints to the fact that Sarah has been through the same dream before, and that she needs these imaginative friends, and dreams to help her see the light as it were.  This film is great, it is what makes, or made fantasy films of this time really enchanting. Real artistry was involved, there was exuberance and charm to it and it has lasted a long time. It is a firm fans favourite and still gains new young fans.

Her fantasy world of escape eventually takes her there. Where at the end of her journey through this maze of craziness she meets her prince who is David Bowie, who looks gorgeous.  She comes in contact with many different bizaar, and strange creatures through her journey. The movie is quite old, made before all the computers and electronics got involved with movies; so therefore all the bizzare beings she comes in contact with are done with the upmost creativity of makeup and customes. It left a great impression upon me at one time, and I bought it for my grandchildren who are in their teens. They too, have many wishes, and like to escape from everyday reality. So, this movie I felt will give them a reality check that everything isn't always what it seems.

It was not."" I now suspect it was this movie they meant to recommend, at least most of them. This one is great!Sarah (Jennifer Connelly) is frustrated and frankly bitchy because she hates having to babysit for her baby brother while her father and step-mother go out. She was in the park playing out her favorite fantasy book, ""Labyrinth"" when she hears a tower clock chime 7. Oh no, she was supposed to be home an hour ago to sit for that darn Toby! Once his parents leave, Toby just will not stop crying, and Sarah gets so annoyed she says ""the right words"" to have the goblins take him away. What's cool is that there is a collection of muppet goblins hiding within hearing (possibly in her closet?) making comments and shushing each other, waiting for her to say the right words.Once the child is gone, the King of the Goblins (David Bowie, in his most perfectly type-casted role ever) appears and tells her she has 13 hours to find Toby or he will keep the boy forever. By the way, his clock has 13 numbers on it, not the usual 12.Only problem is, Toby is being held in the King's Castle, which is surrounded by the strangest labyrinth you've ever seen. Way better than the one in the movie ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,"" if not in the book. [Why did they wimp out on making the labyrinth in that movie so boring compared to the book?]The characters she meets, the unexpected she encounters at every turn, more or less, and how she finally rescues Toby seem more like an acid trip than merely fantasy. In fact, at one point she is given a peach which turns out to be drugged to make her forget. (Shades of ""Wizard of Oz"" there. Well, Frank Oz did work on the film.) Being muppets, these creatures and objects that come to life have great senses of humor, and so many quips and puns and inside jokes happen so fast that I know I'm going to have to watch it several times.I was laughing throughout, but there's also surprises and adventure and even a nod to M.C. Escher. Through it all you will root for Sarah to find Toby, and you will be startled by her successes as much as her set-backs, and the whole thing will be great fun for all.

Feeling ignored and unappreciated by her stepmother, Sarah (Jennifer Connelly) rashly wishes her new baby brother Toby into the clutches of Jareth, the Goblin King (David Bowie).  Realising her folly, Sarah must enter the magical twist-turning Labyrinth and continue through to the Goblin City if she has any hope of rescuing Toby.  But Sarah won't be alone, as she is joined by a motley crew of lovable characters like grumpy Hoggle and kind Ludo.As Sarah travels deeper and deeper into the Labyrinth, Jareth springs several traps in her path, testing her powers of love, loyalty and bravery.Beautifully-brought to life by Jim Henson and his Muppet crew, the creatures of LABYRINTH still amaze with their design and believability.  The performances of the main stars, Jennifer Connelly and David Bowie, likewise are perfectly in keeping with the fantasy element of the story.  Believe it or not, but Jennifer Connelly was barely 14 when she did this film.  Her performance largely carries the film.  The centrepiece sequence of the film, where Sarah dreams she is attending a ball and dances with Jareth to ""As the World Falls Down"", is beautifully-shot with Jennifer Connelly luminous in a silvery white ballgown, and others in grotesque Commedia dell'Arte style masks.The script by MONTY PYTHON's Terry Jones is very witty and clever with homages to ""The Wizard of Oz"" and other fantasy stories.  David Bowie's songs form an integral part of the story with ""Underground"", ""Dance Magic"" and ""Chilly Down"" becoming anthems for the Jareth character.The DVD includes an informative featurette, ""Inside the Labyrinth"", which was made to publicise the film prior to it's original release, and includes interviews with Terry Jones, Jim Henson, Brian Henson, Jennifer Connelly and David Bowie.Well-worth another look for 80's kids and newcomers alike.",4,a classic 80's fantasy film which works on so many levels,1140220800,"02 18, 2006",2006,1980,"['iconic', 'favourite', 'movie', 'child', 'who', 'grew', 'up', '80', 'LABYRINTH', 'now', 'whole', 'new', 'generation', 'fans', 'DVD', 'Feeling', 'ignored', 'unappreciated', 'stepmother', 'Sarah', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'rashly', 'new', 'baby', 'brother', 'Toby', 'clutches', 'Jareth', 'Goblin', 'King', 'David', 'Bowie', 'Realising', 'folly', 'Sarah', 'must', 'enter', 'magical', 'twist-turning', 'Labyrinth', 'continue', 'Goblin', 'City', 'hope', 'rescuing', 'Toby', 'Sarah', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'alone', 'joined', 'motley', 'crew', 'lovable', 'characters', 'grumpy', 'Hoggle', 'kind', 'Ludo.As', 'Sarah', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'Labyrinth', 'Jareth', 'several', 'traps', 'path', 'testing', 'powers', 'love', 'loyalty', 'bravery.Beautifully-brought', 'life', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'Muppet', 'crew', 'creatures', 'LABYRINTH', 'still', 'design', 'believability', 'performances', 'main', 'stars', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'David', 'Bowie', 'likewise', 'are', 'perfectly', 'keeping', 'fantasy', 'element', 'story', 'Believe', 'not', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'was', 'barely', '14', 'when', 'did', 'film', 'performance', 'largely', 'film', 'centrepiece', 'sequence', 'film', 'where', 'Sarah', 'attending', 'ball', 'dances', 'Jareth', 'World', 'Falls', 'Down', 'beautifully-shot', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'luminous', 'silvery', 'white', 'ballgown', 'others', 'grotesque', 'Commedia', ""dell'Arte"", 'style', 'masks.The', 'script', 'MONTY', 'PYTHON', 'Terry', 'Jones', 'very', 'witty', 'clever', 'homages', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'other', 'fantasy', 'stories', 'David', 'Bowie', 'songs', 'form', 'integral', 'part', 'story', 'Underground', 'Dance', 'Magic', 'Chilly', 'Down', 'becoming', 'anthems', 'Jareth', 'character.The', 'DVD', 'informative', 'featurette', 'Labyrinth', 'was', 'made', 'publicise', 'film', 'prior', 'original', 'release', 'interviews', 'Terry', 'Jones', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'Brian', 'Henson', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'David', 'Bowie.Well-worth', 'look', '80', 'kids', 'newcomers', 'alike']",N/A

Our story begins as young Sarah accidentally wishes away her baby brother to the kingdom of the Goblin King, whose castle lies beyond a great labyrinth. Sarah must gather her courage and join forces with a group of unusual allies if she hopes to overcome the maze and win back her brother! Jennifer Connelly stars as the headstrong Sarah, whose grand adventure serves as her own coming of age tale. Sarah must learn to put away her childish toys and accept the responsibilities of adulthood if she hopes to save Toby. David Bowie makes for an enchanting villain just opposite of her as Jareth the Goblin King. The memorable musical numbers that he has written and performed for the film capture a softer side of the artist's unique style. But it is the world of the Labyrinth, itself, that deserves the most attention. The fanciful creatures and elaborate designs make this one of the most imaginative creations in Fantasy cinema. Borrowing from Alice in Wonderland and other traditional fairy tales, it forces Sarah to match both wit and strength in order to succeed.

Along the way, she encounters many pitfalls as well as quite a few very interesting creatures.  Having never been a fan of Bowie's music, I am pleased to say that the ones in this film did appear to be appropriate and did not hinder the overall quality of the film.  Actually, the music helped move the story along nicely.The puppets were nothing less then fantastic, and probably the best to ever come out of Jim Henson's studio.

It's about teenage aspiring actress, Sarah (Jennifer Connelly), who's sick and tired of being mistreated by her parents (Shelley Thompson and Christopher Malcolm) because she thinks her baby brother gets all the attention. Sarah soon begins to hate her baby brother and wishes that he would be taken away by evil goblins. Miraculously, Sarah's wish comes true...but now she's afraid of what might happen to her brother and wants him back. So to get him back, she must embark on a journey through an enchanted labyrinth maze to get her brother back from the evil king goblin (David Bowie). Along the way, she meets many magical creatures and defeats dangerous tasks as she learns what's really important about family.The film's special effects were done by the Lucasfilm company (yes, George Lucas's effects company). The acting is superb from the entire cast, especially a very young Jennifer Connelly and David Bowie. The storyline is wonderful, but the DVD is lacking, with only trailers, production notes, and one documentary on the making of the film. ""Labyrinth"" might actually not be for all ages, since it can be a little scary...esepcially the goblins might creep some young children out.

197181,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,6300151379,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[10, 39]","All set and costume design and no script is how I would describe ""Labyrinth,"" a vehicle for Jim Henson's imagination which stars Jennifer Connelly back when she was just a kid. She plays Sarah, a girl left in charge of her brother Toby and his incessant crying. Because she makes the mistake of vocalizing her displeasure with this situation David Bowie shows up, wearing some brutally tight pants, and wisks Toby away to a magical land. Since Sarah is a good girl she must save Toby, and the only way to do that is by braving the labyrinth, along the way she will learn some middle class values. . .yadda yadda yadda. Poor Jennifer Connelly is given the task of navigating this role in which she is constantly forced to act off of puppets or nothing at all. Thankless indeed. Her dark yet ordinary good looks made me a fan a long time ago (although not this long ago), but her line reading has always been suspect and here is a prime example. And while this movie is a minor failure it is not her fault, she does her best and I think most actors would have had similar difficulties.Rather it is the script that is the downfall here. Sarah's journey through the labyrinth is fairly well managed. She is bombarded with contradictory messages and straight up trickeration, just like she would be in the real world. The lessons she learns are lessons that we lovers of film have learned many times before. The power of the mind is greater than the power of the body and often times power only resides in the mind of the oppressed. But their characters are a mess, they have nothing to say and spend a lot of time saying it. I found it impossible not to lose interest about half way through as the crazy speak coming out of these characters mouths was not worth listening to in the least. Maybe it plays better with the younger set, where an oversized Fozie Bear with the personality of Eeyore could actually hold someone's attention, but I parted ways with my imagination many moons ago.The puppets themselves do look great. There was obviously a lot of creativity that went into their creation and I commend them for it. It is just that in the past few years puppets have started to spoil me. I'm used to them singing great show tunes or making crank phone calls, but these guys kind of just stand around looking creepy, acting like riff raff. There are other missteps to be found here as well. I have no idea why Henson depended on an actual baby to provide facial expressions and dance. There is also a trippy musical number that involves the characters taking off their heads and using them as soccer balls. That scene added nothing to the film and only served to make you wonder what exactly you are watching. But I hold no grudge against this film. It is a cousin of sorts to the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" series, as they both have a teen who must travel through the dark side of the world of make believe. This is a very soft version of said dark side, but dark nonetheless. It is our wildest dreams, but it is also nonsense. Nonsense that sort of kept me entertained, but not enough to recommend it. The person who loaned me this DVD said that it was the greatest children's film of all time, unfortunately I'm not buying what he is selling. Yes, it has a look and fell all it's own, but it is empty (and thus vain), and while I know that empty sells tickets it doesn't earn itself a positive review from me.  **3/4",3,Stick With Pan's Labyrinth,1169251200,"01 20, 2007",2007,3420,"['set', 'costume', 'design', 'script', 'how', 'would', 'describe', 'Labyrinth', 'vehicle', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'imagination', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'just', 'kid', 'Sarah', 'girl', 'left', 'charge', 'brother', 'Toby', 'incessant', 'crying', 'mistake', 'vocalizing', 'displeasure', 'situation', 'David', 'Bowie', 'up', 'wearing', 'brutally', 'tight', 'pants', 'wisks', 'Toby', 'away', 'magical', 'land', 'Sarah', 'good', 'girl', 'must', 'save', 'Toby', 'only', 'way', 'do', 'braving', 'labyrinth', 'way', 'will', 'learn', 'middle', 'class', 'values', '.yadda', 'yadda', 'yadda', 'Poor', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'given', 'task', 'navigating', 'role', 'constantly', 'forced', 'act', 'puppets', 'nothing', 'Thankless', 'indeed', 'dark', 'yet', 'ordinary', 'good', 'looks', 'made', 'fan', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'not', 'long', 'ago', 'line', 'reading', 'always', 'been', 'suspect', 'here', 'prime', 'example', 'movie', 'minor', 'failure', 'not', 'fault', 'best', 'think', 'most', 'actors', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'similar', 'difficulties.Rather', 'script', 'downfall', 'here', 'Sarah', 'journey', 'labyrinth', 'fairly', 'well', 'managed', 'bombarded', 'contradictory', 'messages', 'straight', 'up', 'trickeration', 'just', 'would', 'be', 'real', 'world', 'lessons', 'are', 'lessons', 'lovers', 'film', 'have', 'learned', 'many', 'times', 'before', 'power', 'mind', 'greater', 'power', 'body', 'often', 'times', 'power', 'only', 'mind', 'oppressed', 'characters', 'are', 'mess', 'have', 'nothing', 'say', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'saying', 'found', 'impossible', 'not', 'lose', 'interest', 'way', 'crazy', 'speak', 'coming', 'characters', 'mouths', 'was', 'not', 'worth', 'listening', 'least', 'Maybe', 'better', 'younger', 'set', 'where', 'oversized', 'Fozie', 'Bear', 'personality', 'Eeyore', 'could', 'actually', 'hold', 'someone', 'attention', 'parted', 'ways', 'imagination', 'many', 'moons', 'ago.The', 'puppets', 'do', 'look', 'great', 'was', 'obviously', 'lot', 'creativity', 'went', 'creation', 'commend', 'just', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'puppets', 'have', 'started', 'spoil', ""'m"", 'used', 'singing', 'great', 'show', 'tunes', 'making', 'crank', 'phone', 'calls', 'guys', 'kind', 'just', 'stand', 'around', 'looking', 'creepy', 'acting', 'riff', 'raff', 'are', 'other', 'missteps', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'Henson', 'depended', 'actual', 'baby', 'provide', 'facial', 'expressions', 'dance', 'also', 'trippy', 'musical', 'number', 'characters', 'taking', 'off', 'heads', 'using', 'soccer', 'balls', 'scene', 'added', 'nothing', 'film', 'only', 'served', 'make', 'wonder', 'what', 'exactly', 'are', 'watching', 'hold', 'grudge', 'film', 'cousin', 'sorts', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'series', 'have', 'teen', 'who', 'must', 'travel', 'dark', 'side', 'world', 'make', 'believe', 'very', 'soft', 'version', 'said', 'dark', 'side', 'dark', 'nonetheless', 'wildest', 'dreams', 'also', 'nonsense', 'Nonsense', 'sort', 'kept', 'entertained', 'not', 'enough', 'recommend', 'person', 'who', 'loaned', 'DVD', 'said', 'was', 'greatest', 'children', 'film', 'time', 'unfortunately', ""'m"", 'not', 'buying', 'what', 'selling', 'Yes', 'look', 'fell', 'own', 'empty', 'thus', 'vain', 'know', 'empty', 'tickets', ""n't"", 'earn', 'positive', 'review', '**3/4']",N/A

Though the tone of this film is not as dark as its predecessor, The Dark Crystal, it has become a classic in its own right.Jennifer Connelly (in an early role) stars as Sarah, an imaginative teenager who when left to baby-sit her infant brother, calls upon the goblins of her favorite story to take him away. But when the goblins do she is forced to defy the Goblin King, Jareth, who is superbly played by David Bowie. In order to retrieve her baby brother she must venture deep into a magical labyrinth. There she encounters Hoggle, a curmudgeonly dwarf who begrudgingly helps her on her quest. She also befriends host of other memorable characters including Ludo, a giant hairy behemoth and Sir Didymus, a valiant knight who happens to be a two-and-a-half foot tall and one-eyed dog. She also meets a talking worm that steals the picture for the few moments he's on screen.The story deals with delicate subject matter, mainly what it means to grow from a girl into a woman, but it manages to do so in a sensitive, fun and entertaining way. And the music by David Bowie helps to keep things light. Monty Python's Terry Jones wrote the screenplay and this results in the film's comedic tone. But what really makes this cult classic so unique is the wizardry of Jim Henson's team of puppeteers and special effects designers. The production design is also inspired and even award worthy.The film is a must-have for fans of fantasy films or Jim Henson.The Anniversary Edition of Labyrinth includes the following special features: a new high definition film transfer, a new audio commentary by conceptual designer Brian Froud, Inside the Labyrinth vintage documentary, the new Kingdom of Creatures & The Quest for Goblin City documentaries, photo and art galleries, and previews.Also recommended:The Dark CrystalJim Henson's the Storyteller: The Definitive CollectionThe WitchesJim Henson's Fantasy Film CollectionLabyrinth: From the Original Soundtrack of the Jim Henson FilmThe Goblins of Labyrinthby Terry Jones and illustrated by Brian Froud",4,The Magic of Jim Henson & the Music of David Bowie,1210291200,"05 9, 2008",2008,2116,"['Labyrinth', 'was', 'second', 'fantasy', 'film', 'directed', 'byMuppetcreator', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'tone', 'film', 'not', 'as', 'dark', 'predecessor', 'Dark', 'Crystal', 'become', 'classic', 'own', 'right.Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'early', 'role', 'Sarah', 'imaginative', 'teenager', 'who', 'when', 'left', 'baby-sit', 'infant', 'brother', 'goblins', 'favorite', 'story', 'take', 'away', 'when', 'goblins', 'do', 'forced', 'defy', 'Goblin', 'King', 'Jareth', 'who', 'superbly', 'played', 'David', 'Bowie', 'order', 'retrieve', 'baby', 'brother', 'must', 'venture', 'deep', 'magical', 'labyrinth', 'Hoggle', 'curmudgeonly', 'dwarf', 'who', 'begrudgingly', 'quest', 'also', 'host', 'other', 'memorable', 'characters', 'including', 'Ludo', 'giant', 'hairy', 'behemoth', 'Sir', 'Didymus', 'valiant', 'knight', 'who', 'be', 'two-and-a-half', 'foot', 'tall', 'one-eyed', 'dog', 'also', 'talking', 'worm', 'picture', 'few', 'moments', 'screen.The', 'story', 'deals', 'delicate', 'subject', 'matter', 'mainly', 'what', 'grow', 'girl', 'woman', 'do', 'so', 'sensitive', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'way', 'music', 'David', 'Bowie', 'keep', 'things', 'light', 'Monty', 'Python', 'Terry', 'Jones', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'results', 'film', 'comedic', 'tone', 'what', 'really', 'cult', 'so', 'unique', 'wizardry', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'team', 'puppeteers', 'special', 'effects', 'designers', 'production', 'design', 'also', 'inspired', 'even', 'award', 'worthy.The', 'film', 'must-have', 'fans', 'fantasy', 'films', 'Jim', 'Henson.The', 'Anniversary', 'Edition', 'Labyrinth', 'following', 'special', 'features', 'new', 'high', 'definition', 'film', 'transfer', 'new', 'audio', 'commentary', 'conceptual', 'designer', 'Brian', 'Froud', 'Labyrinth', 'vintage', 'documentary', 'new', 'Kingdom', 'Creatures', 'Quest', 'Goblin', 'City', 'documentaries', 'photo', 'art', 'galleries', 'previews.Also', 'recommended', 'Dark', 'CrystalJim', 'Henson', 'Storyteller', 'Definitive', 'CollectionThe', 'WitchesJim', 'Henson', 'Fantasy', 'Film', 'CollectionLabyrinth', 'Original', 'Soundtrack', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'FilmThe', 'Goblins', 'Labyrinthby', 'Terry', 'Jones', 'illustrated', 'Brian', 'Froud']",N/A
197189,ABXYDATMH4BB9,6300151379,"C. Pollanen ""eino_79""","[0, 1]","Labyrinth to me is one of those movies that seem to stay with you forever.  The entire concept of the film is unique is it's nature.  Imagine making a wish that The Troll King would come and take a loved one away.  What if it actually did happen??  What if you had to go and rescue the loved one??  Well, in this, Sarah (Jennifer Connelly of ""A Beautiful Mind"" fame) wishes her baby brother Toby to be taken away, only for it to happen.  Upon talking to The Troll King, played amazingly by David Bowie, she must travel through the Labyrinth to the Goblin City and face off against The Troll King to reclaim him.  Over the course of her journey through the maze she encounters many interesting characters (Hoggle, Sir Didymus, Ludo, The Bog of Eternal Stench, ""False Alarms"" & others).  Friendship, deception and betryal are just some of the obstacles that Sarah and her companions must overcome.  Eventually she does make it to the castle and meets The Goblin King face to face for the fate of Toby in a battle of the minds.  Will she win, or will Toby remain with the goblins forever??  You will just have to watch the movie to find that one out.  But I can say that the movie is indeed a classic.  It is one of the best fantasy movies of the 80's.  Jim Henson and George Lucas have done a superior job of mixing great special effects with a wonderful array of puppetry.  The DVD transfer is pretty good too, not top notch, but I find it to be quite well done.  The extras aren't too bad either.

This all-time classic always suspends my disbelief to the point where even now when I settle in to enjoy my DVD of this personal favorite, some little corner of my mind accepts that I truly am watching events as they unfold within a massive labyrinth controlled by none other than the coolest of the cool, the sinister and charming Goblin King himself, David Bowie. Had Labyrinth been done a few years later than it was, it would have been computer-generated, and that would have diminished the impact of the Jim Henson characters who as puppets added just the right touch to this story of a quest by a young girl to save her baby brother, Toby, abducted from his crib at her accidental behest, ere he is transformed forever into a goblin. As teenaged Sarah, played by a strikingly beautiful Jennifer Connelly, undertakes her brave trek into the heart of the Goblin King's elaborate magical maze (the sets for Labyrinth are awe-inspiring creations) she encounters its denizens, some helpful, others mischievous, a few malign. The music of Labyrinth is also good enough in its own right to warrant mention and makes for a soundtrack that's also worth owning. (A mini review for you...) Although I own Labyrinth on VHS and purchased it on another DVD a few years ago, this anniversary release is the best of the lot, not only for its ""time capsule"" extra features, but also because for the first time since seeing it in theaters as a kid, Labyrinth is finally featured in a widescreen format which does it justice.

It remains a very charming, entertaining movie that fans of fantasy movies will enjoy regardless of their age. Starring a young Jennifer Connelly and David Bowie, the cast of characters also includes a diverse group of puppets from Jim Henson which are brought to life. The story is straightforward, but the characters make the movie very heart-warming and interesting.Sarah is a teenager forced to babysit her brother who has a rich imagination, reading and acting out parts from a fairy tale which she then accidentally gets herself thrust into. When she wishes the Goblin King would take away her baby brother, he comes and does just that. In order to get the boy back, she must travel to the castle inside the center of a large labyrinth and confront the Goblin King Jareth within 13 hours.Along her path in the labyrinth, Sarah encounters many different creatures. First she meets Hoggle, a dwarf whom she later discovers is acting under orders of Jareth to sabotage her efforts. Hoggle develops a fondness for Sarah however, and is torn between a desire to help her and his fear of Jareth. Learning that not everything is what it seems, she trusts and befriends Ludo, a giant beast who is actually quite gentle. Finally, she befriends Sir Didymus, a small knight who looks a little like a fox and uses a dog as his steed. There are many other fascinating characters discovered along the way, who are not always friendly.In addition to the various characters, the movie also features several fun songs from David Bowie. Each song is well-suited to the situation and worked into the movie. Bowie himself is great as Jareth, the menacing (but not exactly scary) Goblin King. The goblins themselves are often silly - though they don't intend to be - and make you laugh. Jennifer Connelly is good in her role, but I think Bowie and the cast of puppets steal the show. Overall, it's a very enjoyable, fun film.",5,A classic fantasy film great for the whole family,1263427200,"01 14, 2010",2010,2033,"['Seeing', 'movie', 'again', 'recently', 'adult', 'fondly', 'remembering', 'kid', ""n't"", 'lost', 'anything', 'years', 'very', 'charming', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'fans', 'fantasy', 'movies', 'will', 'enjoy', 'regardless', 'age', 'Starring', 'young', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'David', 'Bowie', 'cast', 'characters', 'also', 'diverse', 'group', 'puppets', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'are', 'brought', 'life', 'story', 'straightforward', 'characters', 'make', 'movie', 'very', 'heart-warming', 'interesting.Sarah', 'teenager', 'forced', 'babysit', 'brother', 'who', 'rich', 'imagination', 'reading', 'acting', 'out', 'parts', 'fairy', 'tale', 'then', 'accidentally', 'thrust', 'When', 'Goblin', 'King', 'would', 'take', 'away', 'baby', 'brother', 'just', 'order', 'get', 'boy', 'back', 'must', 'travel', 'castle', 'center', 'large', 'labyrinth', 'confront', 'Goblin', 'King', 'Jareth', '13', 'hours.Along', 'path', 'labyrinth', 'Sarah', 'many', 'different', 'creatures', 'First', 'Hoggle', 'dwarf', 'whom', 'later', 'discovers', 'acting', 'orders', 'Jareth', 'sabotage', 'efforts', 'Hoggle', 'fondness', 'Sarah', 'however', 'torn', 'desire', 'help', 'fear', 'Jareth', 'Learning', 'not', 'everything', 'what', 'Ludo', 'giant', 'beast', 'who', 'actually', 'quite', 'gentle', 'Finally', 'Sir', 'Didymus', 'small', 'knight', 'who', 'little', 'fox', 'dog', 'steed', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'fascinating', 'characters', 'discovered', 'way', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'friendly.In', 'addition', 'various', 'characters', 'movie', 'also', 'several', 'fun', 'songs', 'David', 'Bowie', 'song', 'well-suited', 'situation', 'worked', 'movie', 'Bowie', 'great', 'Jareth', 'menacing', 'not', 'exactly', 'scary', 'Goblin', 'King', 'goblins', 'are', 'often', 'silly', 'do', ""n't"", 'intend', 'be', 'make', 'laugh', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'good', 'role', 'think', 'Bowie', 'cast', 'puppets', 'steal', 'show', 'Overall', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'fun', 'film']",N/A

It's a wonderful tale, with marvellous tunes that linger on and on.  From ""It's Only Forever"", ""Underground"" and ""Chilly Down"" but most especially ""As the World Falls Down"".  Sigh, such a beautiful and deftly filmed Cinderella Ball for Adults.  I don't know a woman that loves this film who does not say ""I want that dress!"".Sarah is an easy to relate to teen.  She is part child - part woman, one foot in each world and truly not belonging to either.  Added to this, her father has remarried and has little time to spend on his growing daughter.  We are not told, but it's clear her mother is dead.  Mom was an actress and lover of the magic and she passed this on to her lovely daughter.  It's very hard to believe Jennifer Connelly is only 12 years old here!!!  She is the perfect Sarah, the beautiful woman-child that has no sense of her place in the world.  Too grown for childish things, too young for boys and dating.  Her cherished childhood toys are giving carelessly to her new baby stepbrother, again emphasizing her feelings of alienation.  Her new mother has little patience, and even when she tries, she meets with a hostile resentful woman-child.  Sarah pain at feeling as if she is not wanted anywhere is so heartbreaking.Left with the crying baby, and feeling that her world is slowly crumbling around her (reflected in Bowie's ""As the World Falls Down""), the child side takes control and spitefully wishes the baby to be taken away from the Goblins.  In true Muppet fashion, they promptly and cheerful comply.  Sarah faces the Goblin King Jareth - perfectly brought to life by Bowie - and demands he return her brother.

The costumes in this movie were really great. I loved sarah's dress in the ballroom scene which is my second favorite scene in the movie. The first being when Sarah is in the room with all the staircases going in different directions and it looks like the room is going in all sorts of directions as well(Can't think of the name of that room). The music is awesome. It has a medieval- fairytale kind of vibe which to me, is very fitting for the film.Some highlights being magic dance, as the world falls down, within you, and underground.

Different genres are represented by at least one movie that makes this grade. eg 'The Matrix' for action sci fi, 'lord of the Rings' for fantasy, 'Saving Private Ryan' for war movies etc. Labyrinth has the distinction of being in this celebrated company, but in which category? It has elements of a musical, puppetry, fantasy and it's a children's and adults genre. This combination, coupled with the amazing voice of David Bowie and puppetry of Jim Henson is part of what makes this movie wonderful viewing. The wacky fantasy storyline has surprisingly found empathy with both adult and child alike. There is subtlety in the movie as well, which will only be obvious to adults and which poses some tantalisingly hidden questions about the movie and the main actor.

When he keeps on crying and screaming all the time, Sara wishes that he'd 'dissapear' to a place far far away. So it happens but she suddenly realizes the grave mistake she made and with the dealings of the Goblin King Jareth (David Bowie) she sets out on an adventure through a complicated maze of walkways and  many obstacles, and solve the labyrinth to save her brother from becoming part of the Goblin Society forever if she doesn't rescue him within twelve hours.""Labyrinth"" is a classic for so many reasons. The storyline while not necessarily trekking new ground (at least at the time) is really fun and charmingly imaginative without being cheesy or two goody-two-shoes. The special effects are utterly amazing. Overall though, ""The Labyrinth"" has a look, atmosphere, and a style almost all of its own and is sorely lacking from a lot of movies of more recent times. Quite clearly one could notice that the Harry Potter movies were inspired by a lot of scenes from this movie.All of the props and characters are awesome. One of my favorites is Hoggle, an `ugly' but good-hearted dwarf who aims to help Sara find her way through the labyrinth. She meets more friends who try to help her in her quest such as Ambrosia The Fox, and the hairy giant Ludo along with many others.The DVD is really good although not the best compared with some others. It contains trailers for the film as well as interviews with the stars involved with the films making. There are also footage of Connelly along with Bowie and others in this movie.

Teens and adults can appreciate this, too -- especially if you're a David Bowie fan -- but it's best for kids between 8-12. Henson indulges his dark side here (though not as much as on some other projects, such as his fairy tale series) but it's balanced with a host of lovable muppet characters -- a Harry-style ogre, a fiesty Don Quixote-esque dog, and a gruff, grouchy gnome -- who help out the film's resourceful teenage heroine.

Whether its Music or Movies, sometimes we really get a surprising result!!...LABYRINTH....is  definitely one of those classics !!!Jim Henson was mostly known for bringing us kids classics like SESAME STREET, THE MUPPET SHOW and FRAGGLE ROCK to name a few....he left us with unique classics over the years that pretty much all the kids know by now, even for us that are now older, we can still remember those old kids show. Some of them are still running strong on TV and now its our kids turn to taste a little bit of that magic!!!!!George Lucas of course is known for his fantasy/sc.fiction movies like  STAR WARS, INDIANA JONES and WILLOW.... He is a well respected producer/screenwriter and director and is movies are still acclaimed by millions every time they come on the big screen, usually generating lots of profit at the box office.LABYRINTH is exactly what we have here, i would say its a perfect match between Jim Henson's world and George Lucas way of bringing fantasy to life!!..kinda like FRAGGLE ROCK meets STAR WARS  but its a whole different  world....The movie is about Sarah (Jennifer Connelly). She likes fairy tales and romantic plays a lot and often acts like she's the heroine of her stories, trying to actually act the way they would.... One thing she don't like very much though is babysitting ! After her parents ask her to baby sit one more time, Sarah find herself stuck to take care of her baby brother again! After reciting one of the lines in her goblin story asking for the goblins to take away her baby brother, the baby actually disappears for real. The goblin king (David Bowie) than comes and explain to sarah that her baby brother is now in his castle,by her fault, which is in the middle of a huge labyrinth. Sarah will have to go and try to find her way in the middle of the labyrinth if she wants to save her baby brother....The movie is an amazing ride!!!.. The labyrinth itself is extremely well done!!!...full of interesting creatures, and secret passages. On her journey to save her brother in the labyrinth, Sarah will meet different creatures on the way....some wanting to help her...some wanting her to fail..... George lucas did an amazing job bringing Jim henson's creatures to life!!!!..This remastered version is also excellent!!! You would think this was shot last years and not in 1986!!!!

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","A child is kidnapped, and the only way for his sister to save him is to navigate a bizarre magical labyrinth... and confront the Goblin King.That's the simple premise behind &#34;Labyrinth,&#34; a coming-of-age fantasy set in a very odd fantasy world. It rests partly on the acting talents of David Bowie and Jennifer Connelly, but also on the glorious sets and special effects -- and the sense that we've been thrown into a world where magic is dangerous and wild. At times it's a bit too silly, but the overall effect is a magnificently otherworldly one.Teenage Sarah (Connelly) loves to lose herself in fantastical daydreams, so she's irritated to be stuck babysitting her crying baby stepbrother. But after she idly wishes that the goblins would steal him... it actually happens. Then the Goblin King Jareth (Bowie) challenges her -- she has only thirteen hours to navigate a hazardous, ever-changing maze. If she fails, her brother will be a goblin himself.As she rushes through the Labyrinth, Sarah encounters a grumpy dwarf named Hoggle (Brian Henson), a gentle beast, a vulpine knight (David Shaughnessy) and many other bizarre creatures who help and/or hinder her. Jareth himself is trying to sabotage her progress -- but no longer just because of the child. Now he's become fascinated by Sarah, and wants her to be his forever.&#34;Labyrinth&#34; was not a commercial success when it was first released, and in fact caused Jim Henson to fall into a depression because he had hoped for better. But it's not hard to see why it became a cult success -- it's a hybrid of &#34;The Dark Crystal&#34; and &#34;Alice in Wonderland,&#34; melding a fantasy quest with a coming-of-age journey. And of course, it has David Bowie as a rock'n'roll goblin. Who couldn't love that?Henson brought the Labyrinth world to life exquisitely -- it's set in a maze of crumbling walls, with vast statues, guttering candles, weeds and branches, pits filled with talking hands, hedge mazes, swamps, a medieval village and an eerie masque that threatens t bespell Sarah. While much of the setting is earthy and solid, there's still a glittering, eerie sense of dangerous yet beautiful things that might appear out of nowhere.Perhaps the movie's biggest flaw is its goofy streak -- such as the self-dismembering Fireys -- when it works best as a semi-serious piece. But the writing is excellent, a mixture of sublime prettiness (&#34;Everything I've done, I've done for you. I move the stars for no one&#34;) and goofiness (&#34;Oh don't act so smart. You don't even know what an oubliette is&#34;).And &#34;Labyrinth&#34; wouldn't work at all without the presence of Bowie and Connelly, both of whom give excellent performances. While it's a bit squicky to see a clearly adult Jareth falling for a teenage girl, Bowie is a mass of charisma and cruel elegance, and his wild hair and tight pants give him that rock'n'roll edge. And Connelly has a fresh-faced innocence that makes Sarah seem... well, like a romantic-minded girl who chafes at caring for a weepy baby.&#34;Labyrinth&#34; is a bit too silly at times, but it also has an unearthly beauty, amazing use of puppets and sets, and two powerful lead performances. Definitely a must-see for the fantasy fan.",4,"It's only forever, not long at all",1403481600,"06 23, 2014",2014,3244,"['child', 'kidnapped', 'only', 'way', 'sister', 'save', 'navigate', 'bizarre', 'magical', 'labyrinth', 'confront', 'Goblin', 'King.That', 'simple', 'premise', '34', 'Labyrinth', '34', 'coming-of-age', 'fantasy', 'set', 'very', 'odd', 'fantasy', 'world', 'partly', 'acting', 'talents', 'David', 'Bowie', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'also', 'glorious', 'sets', 'special', 'effects', 'sense', ""'ve"", 'been', 'thrown', 'world', 'where', 'magic', 'dangerous', 'wild', 'times', 'bit', 'too', 'silly', 'overall', 'effect', 'magnificently', 'otherworldly', 'one.Teenage', 'Sarah', 'Connelly', 'lose', 'fantastical', 'daydreams', 'irritated', 'be', 'stuck', 'babysitting', 'crying', 'baby', 'stepbrother', 'idly', 'goblins', 'would', 'steal', 'actually', 'Then', 'Goblin', 'King', 'Jareth', 'Bowie', 'only', 'thirteen', 'hours', 'navigate', 'hazardous', 'ever-changing', 'maze', 'brother', 'will', 'be', 'goblin', 'himself.As', 'Labyrinth', 'Sarah', 'grumpy', 'dwarf', 'named', 'Hoggle', 'Brian', 'Henson', 'gentle', 'beast', 'vulpine', 'knight', 'David', 'Shaughnessy', 'many', 'other', 'bizarre', 'creatures', 'who', 'help', 'and/or', 'hinder', 'Jareth', 'trying', 'sabotage', 'progress', 'longer', 'just', 'child', 'Now', 'become', 'fascinated', 'Sarah', 'be', 'forever.', '34', 'Labyrinth', '34', 'was', 'not', 'commercial', 'success', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'fact', 'caused', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'fall', 'depression', 'had', 'hoped', 'better', 'not', 'hard', 'see', 'why', 'became', 'cult', 'success', 'hybrid', '34', 'Dark', 'Crystal', '34', '34', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', '34', 'melding', 'fantasy', 'quest', 'coming-of-age', 'journey', 'course', 'David', 'Bowie', 'rock', ""n'roll"", 'goblin', 'Who', 'could', ""n't"", 'love', 'Henson', 'brought', 'Labyrinth', 'world', 'life', 'exquisitely', 'set', 'maze', 'crumbling', 'walls', 'vast', 'statues', 'guttering', 'candles', 'weeds', 'branches', 'pits', 'filled', 'talking', 'hands', 'hedge', 'mazes', 'swamps', 'medieval', 'village', 'eerie', 'masque', 't', 'bespell', 'Sarah', 'much', 'setting', 'earthy', 'solid', 'still', 'glittering', 'eerie', 'sense', 'dangerous', 'yet', 'beautiful', 'things', 'might', 'appear', 'nowhere.Perhaps', 'movie', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'goofy', 'streak', 'such', 'self-dismembering', 'Fireys', 'when', 'best', 'semi-serious', 'piece', 'writing', 'excellent', 'mixture', 'sublime', 'prettiness', '34', 'Everything', ""'ve"", 'done', ""'ve"", 'done', 'move', 'stars', 'one', '34', 'goofiness', '34', 'Oh', 'do', ""n't"", 'act', 'so', 'smart', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'what', 'oubliette', '34', '.And', '34', 'Labyrinth', '34', 'would', ""n't"", 'work', 'presence', 'Bowie', 'Connelly', 'whom', 'give', 'excellent', 'performances', 'bit', 'squicky', 'see', 'clearly', 'adult', 'Jareth', 'falling', 'teenage', 'girl', 'Bowie', 'mass', 'charisma', 'cruel', 'elegance', 'wild', 'hair', 'tight', 'pants', 'give', 'rock', ""n'roll"", 'edge', 'Connelly', 'fresh-faced', 'innocence', 'Sarah', 'seem', 'well', 'romantic-minded', 'girl', 'who', 'chafes', 'caring', 'weepy', 'baby.', '34', 'Labyrinth', '34', 'bit', 'too', 'silly', 'times', 'also', 'unearthly', 'beauty', 'amazing', 'use', 'puppets', 'sets', 'two', 'powerful', 'lead', 'performances', 'Definitely', 'must-see', 'fantasy', 'fan']",N/A

Where Dark Crystal took itself too seriously, Labyrinth goes to the opposite extreme and doesn't even bother with a serious plot.

It's simply Jennifer Connelly going though a maze with a bunch of puppets in order to find her little brother. Unfortunately, that just wasn't enough to hold my interest. While I love the use of puppets and think they can bring much more life to characters than CGI, the characters in Labyrinth just don't have much meat to them.

When she wishes her brother away, he is seized and taken by the Goblin King, Jareth (David Bowie). What soon follows is Sarah's journey into a strange land in attempts to save her brother.

If you're purchasing this movie on Blu-ray, chances are that you've already seen it and love it as much as I do.  The movie itself gets a 6/5 from me!  Imaginative, captivating, and amazing.The Blu-ray transfer of Labyrinth is, surprisingly, much better than I thought.  The 1080p picture quality is AMAZING.  The goblins' faces, the glistening walls of the labyrinth, Ludo's fur...you just want to reach out and touch!  Even the CGI owl in the opening credits looks incredible.  Kudos to Sony for putting such effort to make this film look as great as it can.The sound, however, is where the Blu-ray comes up short.  While not terrible by any means, I have to say that the Superbit DVD version far and away beats the Blu-ray.  The mixing is all sorts of unbalanced here, and it creates some pretty jarring moments.  Specifically, the background music is way too soft throughout the entire film.  This is unfortunate, as Trevor Jones' score is immaculate. However, it's downright tragic during the musical sequences of the film.  While the background music is low, the vocals are overly loud (even louder than the dialog).  The ""Chilly Down"" part is almost unlistenable.  There's also one part where Hoggle's lines have been overdubbed (in the oubliette, ""Well, can't be right all the time"" is arbitrarily changed to ""Can't be right all the time, can we?"" in what sounds like a different voice).  Also, the 5.1 surround mix isn't as ""surrounding"" as it can be.  On the DVD, when Ludo calls the rocks, his howls begin in the front speakers and gradually move to the rear.  This doesn't happen on the Blu-ray, and it's a shame.Mixed bag on this release.

From the stylish designs of the settings and muppets, to the actual cinematography employed to capture them on film - this movie just looks great.  A truly wondrous and unique fantasy world has been created here.  The high quality of the artwork is what really carries this film, it practically glosses over all the flaws.  Not that the flaws are particularly numerous.  As a fantasy that is ultimately aimed at younger children, it achieves what it set out to do.  The plot is serviceable, and the execution is generally good (though a tad uneven - some parts are better than others).The two humans (the others are all muppets after all) do a nice job of their roles.  The one really glaring flaw is the music - and it hurts.  As one of the film's messages says, don't take things for granted - and that includes a well done musical accompaniment that fits the film, which alas is sorely lacking.  It is a further testament to the capacity of the visuals to hold your attention that the film survives despite the fact that one of the key components of movie making is entirely lacking.  The severely dated nature of the music can only look more and more ridiculous as the years pass, but that really can't be helped.Ultimately though this film stands as a fairly unique achievement - there really aren't that many like it (one that stands out is Henson's other earlier film, The Dark Crystal - which in my opinion is a more even achievement).Young children will obviously enjoy this movie, but even older folk, such as myself, can find more than a few things to appreciate in it.The DVD edition I viewed was the standard one, not the Superbit or the Collector's Box edition.

The story takes wisps from Lewis Carroll and reimagines 'Alice' as if she had a little brother to rescue from Wonderland as well as restoring herself.  Jennifer Connelly is marvelous and natural in her film debut as Sarah, the girl who must somehow outwit the Goblin King, playing his game on his terms to rescue her baby brother.There is a simmering chemistry between Ms. Connelly and Mr. Bowie, though Henson always keeps the movie's tone fairly suitable for family viewing.  David Bowie is completely believable in a role he was born to play, also contributing several songs to the movie.  My personal favorites are ""Magic Dance"" and ""It's Only Forever.""  The casting for Jareth is crucial, and Bowie completely inhabits the role.  A wispy menace and a smirking, subtle predator for both Sarah and her brother Toby, Jareth is a very good villain.Jim Henson populates the movie with original Muppet creations, and the best of them are a disagreeable gnomelike creature called Hoggle and an eerie Junk Lady.  If it's possible to overdo Muppets, this movie may have done it.  I would have rather seen much more of the fascinating dynamic between Sarah and Jareth and less of the plentiful new Muppets.

197262,A3TY1C8ZHY5THP,6300151379,"Inept Editor ""TheIneptOwl.com""","[1, 3]","This week I went to the movie showtimes section of my newspaper with the intent of going to see the new movie, Stardust.  As much as I do very much want to see that movie, based on a book by Neil Gaiman, who I consider to be perhaps today's definitive master of fantasy, I was sidetracked by a listing of a special showing going on in at the same theater.  That would be the phrase ""Jim Henson's Labyrinth.""My heart indeed skipped a beat when I saw this.  With all due respect to Mr. Gaiman, Stardust will still be playing in theaters next week, but a special screening of a Jim Henson movie is not to be missed.  I will say that I have long felt that the loss of Henson is one of the truest tragedies of the modern creative age, everything the man did was full of such odd twists and turns, taking things to levels of originality and imagination far outreaching the majority of his peers, and Labyrinth is a prime example of that.I was apprehensive at first going in, almost even deciding to see Stardust instead, feeling that maybe it would be better to see something new than risk tarnishing the memory of a movie I had not seen in well over a decade.  Well the call of muppets cannot be denied and so I ended up taking the risk and I'm glad I did.  While the usage of synthesizers and the presence of a very-era David Bowie certainly date the movie, they don't distract from the enjoyment of it, and I even remember why I had such a massive crush at one point on Jennifer Connelly.I'm a big fan in general of the Muppets and Fraggle Rock, but what impresses me about Labyrinth and its predecessor, the Dark Crystal, is the ability to take the same level of imagination directed towards those worlds and channel them into an entirely different universe, with a magic all its own, a place where Kermit the Frog and crew would be entirely foreign concepts.  Labyrinth creates a world where a glam rock idol rules over an army of goblins, goblins who use weapons which are made up of other goblins.  A world where a giant Yeti monster controls summons rocks with his yell because they're his friends, and where a noble fox with an eyepatch rides a dog into battle.With all the above mentioned insanity, it seems like it would be hard to point out something that sums up what makes Labyrinth such an amazing piece of film.  However, for me, it happens in a scene about midway through the movie. Hoggle, the cowardly little creature who leads heroine Sarah through various parts of the labyrinth is searching for her and is interrupted by Jareth the Goblin King, but first passes a piece of stone that is shaped like a face.  As he moves past the face, we see that it is in fact three separate pieces that form one single image when seen directly in front of the camera.  This face is probably visible on film for a matter of seconds, if that, and is then broken apart as the angle moves away from the rocks.  Yet Henson and crew found this detail important enough to spend time cutting material, designing a set, and placing the rocks in exactly the right spot, hoping that at least one viewer would catch it",5,"Yeah, Cod-Piece!",1263427200,"01 14, 2010",2010,3107,"['week', 'went', 'movie', 'section', 'newspaper', 'intent', 'going', 'see', 'new', 'movie', 'Stardust', 'As', 'much', 'do', 'very', 'much', 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'based', 'book', 'Neil', 'Gaiman', 'who', 'consider', 'be', 'perhaps', 'today', 'definitive', 'master', 'fantasy', 'was', 'sidetracked', 'listing', 'special', 'showing', 'going', 'same', 'theater', 'would', 'be', 'phrase', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'Labyrinth', 'heart', 'indeed', 'skipped', 'beat', 'when', 'saw', 'due', 'respect', 'Mr.', 'Gaiman', 'Stardust', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'playing', 'theaters', 'week', 'special', 'screening', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'movie', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'will', 'say', 'have', 'long', 'felt', 'loss', 'Henson', 'one', 'truest', 'tragedies', 'modern', 'creative', 'age', 'everything', 'man', 'did', 'was', 'full', 'such', 'odd', 'twists', 'turns', 'taking', 'things', 'levels', 'originality', 'imagination', 'far', 'outreaching', 'majority', 'peers', 'Labyrinth', 'prime', 'example', 'that.I', 'was', 'apprehensive', 'first', 'going', 'almost', 'even', 'deciding', 'see', 'Stardust', 'instead', 'feeling', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'see', 'something', 'new', 'risk', 'tarnishing', 'memory', 'movie', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'well', 'decade', 'Well', 'call', 'muppets', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'denied', 'so', 'ended', 'up', 'taking', 'risk', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'usage', 'synthesizers', 'presence', 'very-era', 'David', 'Bowie', 'certainly', 'date', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'distract', 'enjoyment', 'even', 'remember', 'why', 'had', 'massive', 'crush', 'one', 'point', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly.I', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'general', 'Muppets', 'Fraggle', 'Rock', 'what', 'Labyrinth', 'predecessor', 'Dark', 'Crystal', 'ability', 'take', 'same', 'level', 'imagination', 'directed', 'towards', 'worlds', 'channel', 'entirely', 'different', 'universe', 'magic', 'own', 'place', 'where', 'Kermit', 'Frog', 'crew', 'would', 'be', 'entirely', 'foreign', 'concepts', 'Labyrinth', 'world', 'where', 'glam', 'rock', 'idol', 'rules', 'army', 'goblins', 'goblins', 'who', 'use', 'weapons', 'are', 'made', 'other', 'goblins', 'world', 'where', 'giant', 'Yeti', 'monster', 'controls', 'summons', 'rocks', 'yell', ""'re"", 'friends', 'where', 'noble', 'fox', 'eyepatch', 'dog', 'battle.With', 'above', 'mentioned', 'insanity', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'point', 'out', 'something', 'up', 'what', 'Labyrinth', 'such', 'amazing', 'piece', 'film', 'However', 'scene', 'midway', 'movie', 'Hoggle', 'cowardly', 'little', 'creature', 'who', 'heroine', 'Sarah', 'various', 'parts', 'labyrinth', 'searching', 'interrupted', 'Jareth', 'Goblin', 'King', 'first', 'piece', 'stone', 'shaped', 'face', 'face', 'see', 'fact', 'three', 'separate', 'pieces', 'form', 'one', 'single', 'image', 'when', 'seen', 'directly', 'front', 'camera', 'face', 'probably', 'visible', 'film', 'matter', 'seconds', 'then', 'broken', 'apart', 'angle', 'away', 'rocks', 'Henson', 'crew', 'found', 'detail', 'important', 'enough', 'spend', 'time', 'cutting', 'material', 'designing', 'set', 'placing', 'rocks', 'exactly', 'right', 'spot', 'hoping', 'least', 'one', 'viewer', 'would', 'catch']",N/A

You could call it a modern fairy tale, but it's just not deep enough. And for a film called Labyrinth, it's strangely uncomplicated.Jennifer Connelly (younger and prettier, though her acting is questionable) stars as Sarah, a teenager who bizarrely doesn't have a boyfriend and ends up living in her own fantasy world. Her dad and stepmother go out, leaving her to babysit her baby brother. Annoyed with his crying she utters a magical spell, wishing the goblins to take him away. Sure as sugar, the Goblin King himself (Tina Turner, oh sorry...I mean David Bowie) turns up and takes away the screaming tot.In order to get him back she must solve 'The Labyrinth' (cue dramatic music) and reach the Goblin King's Castle within 13 hours. Along the way she meets new friends (of the Jim Henson variety) in the form of Hoggle the dwarf, big, hairy and cuddly Ludo and cute little fox Sir Didymus. It's pleasant enough entertainment but there are some serious problems.The most serious of them all is David Bowie's attire. Most specifically, his trousers, they are a little revealing in the crotch department to make an understatement. You'll cringe, you'll avert your eyes, yet you'll be mesmerized. Come on, how could this have been allowed in a family movie. Plus, Trevor Jones' score is disappointingly unmagical and the filmmakers have given in to the urge to have David Bowie crank out some dreadfully 80's tunes that stagger the action and hold up the plot.It's a shame to call Labyrinth nostalgic. But if it were made today it would be full of hollow CGI. There's something charming in practical effects and puppetry (or is that Muppetry?) that no computer graphic can generate. The photography and is stunning and it captures landscape and fantasy perfectly. And all those cute Jim Henson characters are far more interesting than any Hobbit.Filmed in Panavision, the 2.35:1 1080p picture looks good, there's hardly any grain, no dirt and perfect colors, with DTS HD-MA sound.

The real world is quickly left behind as we follow Sarah - a petulant teenager with a lively imagination - on a quest to save her baby brother from the clutches of the Goblin King. With the help and hindrance of sundry fantastical dwarves, goblins, beasts, and the ilk (brought to life through the puppetry genius of Jim Henson) she has 13 hours in which to solve the labyrinth.Given the talent of Henson, the human actors were always going to face stiff competition. Jennifer Connelly plays the lovely but perpetually startled-looking heroine (although perhaps she is surprised at the clunky and unlikely dialogue she occasionally spouts). However the casting agents were spot on in their choice of the deliciously androgynous and mocking David Bowie as Jareth the Goblin King.But the real stars of the show are the denizens of the labyrinth. These range from the simple yet visually effective 'helping hands', to huge hirsute beasts, to a goblin army, and some funky fire-dancers. Similarly impressive is the interior of the Goblin King's castle, which is a replica of the famous optical illusion involving staircases that appear to float in mid-air and connect to each other at impossible angles.Although there is some bad dubbing and a seemingly endless number of what must be the fakest polystyrene rocks ever to have graced the silver screen, this only minimally dilutes the viewing pleasure. Labyrinth will reward the spectator (even those who would not class a fantasy film as their normal fare) by transporting them to a captivating world where things are not always as they seem.",4,"""Now, would you go left, or right?""",1027641600,"07 26, 2002",2002,1718,"['Labyrinth', 'was', 'made', '1986', 'passage', 'time', ""n't"", 'dimmed', 'spectacular', 'demesne', 'viewer', 'eyes', 'real', 'world', 'quickly', 'left', 'behind', 'follow', 'Sarah', 'petulant', 'teenager', 'lively', 'imagination', 'quest', 'save', 'baby', 'brother', 'clutches', 'Goblin', 'King', 'help', 'hindrance', 'sundry', 'fantastical', 'dwarves', 'goblins', 'beasts', 'ilk', 'brought', 'life', 'puppetry', 'genius', 'Jim', 'Henson', '13', 'hours', 'solve', 'labyrinth.Given', 'talent', 'Henson', 'human', 'actors', 'were', 'always', 'going', 'face', 'stiff', 'competition', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'lovely', 'perpetually', 'startled-looking', 'heroine', 'perhaps', 'surprised', 'clunky', 'unlikely', 'dialogue', 'occasionally', 'However', 'casting', 'agents', 'were', 'spot', 'choice', 'deliciously', 'androgynous', 'mocking', 'David', 'Bowie', 'Jareth', 'Goblin', 'King.But', 'real', 'stars', 'show', 'are', 'denizens', 'labyrinth', 'range', 'simple', 'yet', 'visually', 'effective', ""'helping"", 'hands', 'huge', 'hirsute', 'beasts', 'goblin', 'army', 'funky', 'fire-dancers', 'Similarly', 'impressive', 'interior', 'Goblin', 'King', 'castle', 'replica', 'famous', 'optical', 'illusion', 'involving', 'staircases', 'appear', 'float', 'mid-air', 'connect', 'other', 'impossible', 'bad', 'dubbing', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'number', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'fakest', 'polystyrene', 'rocks', 'ever', 'have', 'graced', 'silver', 'screen', 'only', 'minimally', 'viewing', 'pleasure', 'Labyrinth', 'will', 'reward', 'spectator', 'even', 'who', 'would', 'not', 'class', 'fantasy', 'film', 'normal', 'fare', 'transporting', 'captivating', 'world', 'where', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'seem']",N/A

197287,A34792YZU3EH56,6300151379,J. Swagman,"[14, 20]","This is yet another movie from the 80s I remember seeing advertisements for as a child, but not being allowed to see at the time. (This is a children's movie, but rated PG which is a bit of a strange combination. We'll get to more of that below). For one reason or another I never bothered to catch up with it in the years since, but in college and beyond I met several people who were huge fans of this movie.Although I know this movie has a large cult fan base among people of my generation, I think much of that is based on nostalgia. Which is hard for me, at the age of 29, to plug into. If I had seen this movie when I was 7, I'm sure it would have been a different story. And perhaps if I had seen this movie at 17, when I was just getting into classic rock and learning who David Bowie was, it might still have had a lot of appeal as a psychedelic rock film. But as it was, I'm afraid I found most of the film pretty stale and boring.It's a pity because there's so much talent attached to this film: George Lucas, Jim Henson, Terry Jones of Monty Python as the screen writer, the drawing of MC Escher...(now that I'm no longer 17, I've decided I'm not a David Bowie fan, but you can't win them all).And don't get me wrong, there are moments of genius in this film. A lot of the weird fantastic creatures are absolutely wonderful, and reminded me of why I liked the Muppet show so much as a child. And the general atmosphere of the film reminds me of ""The Jim Henson Hour"", (a short lived television that was on for a few months when I was in 5th grade) and so gets a couple nostalgia points from me there.Unfortunately despite all the weird and wonderful Muppet creatures that populate this movie, the story is long, pointless and wandering. And, as usually happens with Muppet movies, the human actors really stink up the stage even though the puppets do a wonderful job.The humor in this movie is really touch and go. Especially after all the recent children's movies by companies like Pixar which have sharp cutting humor that can also be enjoyed by adults, the humor in the Labyrinth doesn't hold up well by comparison. Typical example:""If she kisses you,I'll make you a prince.""""You will?""""Prince of the land of stink!""A lot of the humor is also based purely on random strangeness, which is got to be the laziest kind of humor.And yet, again, there are periodic moments of genius, where the old Monty Python influence seems to be coming through in Terry Jones. Like the scene where the Stone creatures are yelling out warnings of doom, and when they get told to shut up they become sensitive and reply that they are only doing their job.The obvious comparison for a film like this is ""Alice in Wonderland"". Which was a children's film Disney released in 1951 and 20 years later, much to the Disney company's dismay, became known as a classic ""Head"" movie.I think by the time ""Labyrinth"" came around, they were already anticipating that this film would be a hippy classic. Call me cynical, but I can't believe the people making this film never leaned over and said to each other something like, ""Man, this is going to be such a good film to watch while high.""And this is the biggest problem with this movie. It doesn't have a clear idea of what it wants to be. Is this a children's movie with lovable puppets and messages about friendship? Is this a psychedelic rock musical with David Bowie? Is this just a weird trip? Mixing genres isn't a bad thing to do, but it's a dangerous thing to do if it's not pulled off right, and this movie doesn't pull it off right. Scenes from one part of the movie don't fit with scenes from another part.And the Muppet urinating scene? What were they thinking?",2,wonderful imagination unfortunately no substitute for solid story,1180137600,"05 26, 2007",2007,3705,"['yet', 'movie', '80s', 'remember', 'seeing', 'advertisements', 'child', 'not', 'being', 'allowed', 'see', 'time', 'children', 'movie', 'rated', 'PG', 'bit', 'strange', 'combination', ""'ll"", 'get', 'more', 'below', 'one', 'reason', 'never', 'bothered', 'catch', 'up', 'years', 'college', 'met', 'several', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'huge', 'fans', 'movie.Although', 'know', 'movie', 'large', 'cult', 'fan', 'base', 'people', 'generation', 'think', 'much', 'based', 'nostalgia', 'Which', 'hard', 'age', '29', 'plug', 'had', 'seen', 'movie', 'when', 'was', '7', ""'m"", 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'different', 'story', 'perhaps', 'had', 'seen', 'movie', '17', 'when', 'was', 'just', 'getting', 'classic', 'rock', 'learning', 'who', 'David', 'Bowie', 'was', 'might', 'still', 'have', 'had', 'lot', 'appeal', 'psychedelic', 'rock', 'film', 'was', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'found', 'most', 'film', 'pretty', 'stale', 'boring.It', 'pity', 'so', 'much', 'talent', 'attached', 'film', 'George', 'Lucas', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'Terry', 'Jones', 'Monty', 'Python', 'screen', 'writer', 'drawing', 'MC', 'Escher', 'now', ""'m"", 'no', 'longer', '17', ""'ve"", 'decided', ""'m"", 'not', 'David', 'Bowie', 'fan', 'ca', ""n't"", 'win', '.And', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'are', 'moments', 'genius', 'film', 'lot', 'weird', 'fantastic', 'creatures', 'are', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'reminded', 'why', 'liked', 'Muppet', 'show', 'so', 'much', 'child', 'general', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'Hour', 'short', 'lived', 'television', 'was', 'few', 'months', 'when', 'was', '5th', 'grade', 'so', 'couple', 'nostalgia', 'points', 'there.Unfortunately', 'weird', 'wonderful', 'Muppet', 'creatures', 'populate', 'movie', 'story', 'long', 'pointless', 'wandering', 'usually', 'Muppet', 'movies', 'human', 'actors', 'really', 'stink', 'up', 'stage', 'even', 'puppets', 'do', 'wonderful', 'job.The', 'humor', 'movie', 'really', 'touch', 'go', 'Especially', 'recent', 'children', 'movies', 'companies', 'Pixar', 'have', 'sharp', 'cutting', 'humor', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'adults', 'humor', 'Labyrinth', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'well', 'comparison', 'Typical', 'example', ""'ll"", 'make', 'prince', 'will', 'Prince', 'land', 'stink', 'lot', 'humor', 'also', 'based', 'purely', 'random', 'strangeness', 'got', 'be', 'laziest', 'kind', 'humor.And', 'yet', 'again', 'are', 'periodic', 'moments', 'genius', 'where', 'old', 'Monty', 'Python', 'influence', 'be', 'coming', 'Terry', 'Jones', 'scene', 'where', 'Stone', 'creatures', 'are', 'yelling', 'out', 'warnings', 'doom', 'when', 'get', 'told', 'shut', 'up', 'become', 'sensitive', 'reply', 'are', 'only', 'doing', 'job.The', 'obvious', 'comparison', 'film', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'Which', 'was', 'children', 'film', 'Disney', 'released', '1951', '20', 'years', 'later', 'much', 'Disney', 'company', 'dismay', 'became', 'known', 'classic', 'Head', 'movie.I', 'think', 'time', 'Labyrinth', 'came', 'around', 'were', 'already', 'anticipating', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'hippy', 'classic', 'Call', 'cynical', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'people', 'making', 'film', 'never', 'leaned', 'said', 'other', 'something', 'Man', 'going', 'be', 'such', 'good', 'film', 'watch', 'high', 'biggest', 'problem', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'clear', 'idea', 'what', 'be', 'children', 'movie', 'lovable', 'puppets', 'messages', 'friendship', 'psychedelic', 'rock', 'musical', 'David', 'Bowie', 'just', 'weird', 'trip', 'Mixing', 'genres', ""n't"", 'bad', 'thing', 'do', 'dangerous', 'thing', 'do', 'not', 'pulled', 'off', 'right', 'movie', ""n't"", 'pull', 'off', 'right', 'Scenes', 'one', 'part', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'fit', 'scenes', 'part.And', 'Muppet', 'urinating', 'scene', 'What', 'were', 'thinking']",N/A

The world of the Labyrinth is a kind of dark wonderland, where things aren't always what they seem.  Beautiful things aren't nice.  Ugly things aren't bad.  Scary-looking things are harmless, while things that look harmless are dangerous.There is a wonderful coming-of-age story here as well.  Sarah is caught with one foot in the fanciful world of youth, and one in the dangerous world of adults.  She is not really ready to grow up, but at the same time, she wants to.  The scene where she wanders into the ballroom, looking lost among the masked adults visually tells us the whole story.  The film is great about showing, rather than telling, its themes.  You can know Sarah just as well by looking around her bedroom as by seeing the way she acts.  The scene where the Owl is left on the outside looking in through her window as she plays with her friends perfectly conveys the loneliness of someone left on the outside, as unable to cross into Sarah's fantastical world of childhood as she was unable to fit into his fantastical world of adulthood.  The film places great value on fantasy and imagination, and tells us that we don't have to be in a hurry to grow up.This is a timeless fairy tale.  Spectacular visuals and fun songs carry the fantastic elements of the story, but you can tell that every set piece, every puppet character was constructed lovingly to be a part of the world.  Sadly, modern computer-generated worlds do not have the same sense of love in their creation.  They can be flashy and colorful, and sometimes even pretty, but I've not seen any CGI world compare with the dark beauty of the Labyrinth and its fantastic denizens.  The characters and story are simple, beautiful, and wonderful.  And no matter how many times you visit their twisted world, you never tire of it.  This film holds just as much fun and wonder for me as an adult as it did when I was a child.  There are not many films that can do that, but Labyrinth is one of them.  It remains one of the best fantasy films of all time.",5,"""Things are not always what they seem in this place.""",1303776000,"04 26, 2011",2011,2964,"['One', 'favorite', 'movies', 'was', 'child', 'Labyrinth', 'one', 'movies', 'never', 'old', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'story', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'baby', 'brother', 'taken', 'away', 'goblins', 'when', 'goblins', 'really', 'do', 'steal', 'away', 'child', 'up', 'Sarah', 'find', 'way', 'goblin', 'city', 'center', 'Labyrinth', 'rescue', 'way', 'will', 'encounter', 'kinds', 'fantastic', 'creatures', 'people', 'fairy', 'gentle', 'ogre', 'can', 'summon', 'rocks', 'talking', 'worms', 'ultimate', 'hoarder', 'many', 'more', 'wonderful', 'journey', 'wo', ""n't"", 'forget.Labyrinth', 'one', 'most', 'visually', 'beautiful', 'films', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'sets', 'puppets', 'are', 'works', 'art', 'visuals', 'really', 'carry', 'sense', 'wonder', 'Watching', 'movie', 'actually', 'feel', 'are', 'world', 'characters', 'are', 'as', 'real', 'human', 'actors', 'world', 'Labyrinth', 'kind', 'dark', 'wonderland', 'where', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'what', 'seem', 'Beautiful', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'nice', 'Ugly', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', 'Scary-looking', 'things', 'are', 'harmless', 'things', 'look', 'harmless', 'are', 'dangerous.There', 'wonderful', 'coming-of-age', 'story', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'Sarah', 'caught', 'one', 'foot', 'fanciful', 'world', 'youth', 'one', 'dangerous', 'world', 'adults', 'not', 'really', 'ready', 'grow', 'up', 'same', 'time', 'scene', 'where', 'ballroom', 'looking', 'lost', 'masked', 'adults', 'visually', 'whole', 'story', 'film', 'great', 'showing', 'rather', 'telling', 'themes', 'can', 'know', 'Sarah', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'looking', 'bedroom', 'seeing', 'way', 'scene', 'where', 'Owl', 'left', 'outside', 'looking', 'window', 'friends', 'perfectly', 'conveys', 'loneliness', 'someone', 'left', 'outside', 'unable', 'cross', 'Sarah', 'fantastical', 'world', 'childhood', 'was', 'unable', 'fit', 'fantastical', 'world', 'adulthood', 'film', 'great', 'value', 'fantasy', 'imagination', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'hurry', 'grow', 'up.This', 'timeless', 'fairy', 'tale', 'Spectacular', 'visuals', 'fun', 'songs', 'carry', 'fantastic', 'elements', 'story', 'can', 'tell', 'set', 'piece', 'puppet', 'character', 'was', 'constructed', 'lovingly', 'be', 'part', 'world', 'Sadly', 'modern', 'computer-generated', 'worlds', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'same', 'sense', 'love', 'creation', 'can', 'be', 'flashy', 'colorful', 'sometimes', 'even', 'pretty', ""'ve"", 'not', 'seen', 'CGI', 'world', 'compare', 'dark', 'beauty', 'Labyrinth', 'fantastic', 'denizens', 'characters', 'story', 'are', 'simple', 'beautiful', 'wonderful', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'visit', 'twisted', 'world', 'never', 'tire', 'film', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'fun', 'wonder', 'adult', 'did', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'are', 'not', 'many', 'films', 'can', 'do', 'Labyrinth', 'one', 'one', 'best', 'fantasy', 'films', 'time']",N/A
197303,A120V3RVSK1O1K,6300151379,K. Ostrowski,"[0, 0]","Once upon a time, there was a decade called the 1980s.  In that decade, a number of fantasy movies were released.  They were stylish and thrilling, with good humor and likable characters, and they delivered moods well.  The downside was that no matter how hard they tried, they could never seem to tell a story all the way through.  Time after time, they either launched too quickly into the main plot without giving the characters any chance to shine on their own, or resolved the main problem too quickly, or in a confusing or unsatisfying way.  Sometimes, the main villain would end the film with a speech that made no sense, and half the time, the entire premise of the film seemed to make very little sense until one spent about an hour pondering over it, and then, one had to wonder just why the director couldn't have been a little clearer about just what was really going on.Seriously, though.  Labrynth is clearly one such movie.  It's as much a metaphor as it is a story, and the characters and situations can get very confusing if you don't view them in that way.I kid 80s movies, though.  Some actually did take the time to explain why they ended the way they did, but not many (the Princess Bride and the Neverending Story being perhaps the best examples.)  Labrynth, in some ways, is midway between those films and the likes of ""Legend,"" one of the most head-scratching films I've ever seen in my life (though I do remember enjoying it somewhat.)Sarah is something that was very rare in the 80s; a girl who's utterly obsessed with other-world fantasy stories.  She even cosplays as an adventurer in a secluded section of her neighborhood.  However, every week, her parents force her to baby-sit her baby brother, who repeatedly gets on her nerves.  Eventually, she wishes that the goblins would come and take him away.  They do.The goblins, led by a tall, dashing goblin king named Jareth, seize the child and carry him back to the castle in the center of the Labrynth, and it's up to Sarah to solve the puzzles of the Labrynth, get into the castle, and face off against the goblin king for the fate of her baby brother.  Along the way, she makes friends, meets strange creatures, learns life lessons, etc...  Her journey, in fact, is so bizarre and episodic that it could be compared with Alice in Wonderland.The morals in the film come in two types; ""minor,"" and ""major.""  The difference is that some moral lessons (minor) only last one or two scenes, while others (major) can be inferred from the movie as a whole.The minor lessons, on average, are a mixed bag, ranging from things that are -truly- moral, like forgiveness and faithfulness, to issues of mere good manners, like asking permission.  However, none of them, at least, -encourage- immorality, so on the whole, I'd say I was impressed.With regard to the major lessons of the film, I think some mistakes have been made on the part of certain past reviewers.  Some reviewers seem to assume that the point of the film was supposed to be; Sarah needs to recognize that her fantasies aren't as important as the real people she knows.  I don't believe that at all.  If they'd wanted that to be the moral of the story, it easily could have been.  My view of the major moral of the movie is this.""We all have things we don't need, which we could easily give up for the sake of others, and which we should, because mere possessions aren't as important as people.  However, don't worry.  Just because you sacrifice to help people doesn't mean you need to give up your dreams.  In fact, you may find them being fulfilled more often if you focus on helping others.""I think you'll find that if this -is- the moral of the movie, it fulfills it quite well, and for me, as a Christian, I consider this a better moral than ""grow up and don't want odd or supernatural things anymore.""  We're -supposed- to want things to be different than they are in this life.  That's half of the point.  There's also something hauntingly-relevant about a movie where the main character is a female protagonist who initially doesn't want a baby, but eventually realizes what a mistake it is to get rid of him.Jareth is a charming villain, Sarah is a likable protagonist, and the other characters never really get annoying.  The sets, paintings, special effects and so on all look pretty nice, and the musical numbers are delightful; especially ""magic dance.""I think the one exception to this generally-good graphics and sound quality is the ""fire dance"" segment, where the green screen effects are pretty terrible, and the song is somewhat ruined by the fact that you can barely hear what they're singing.  Still, even that's somewhat enjoyable to watch.The film itself is -very- high-fantasy, and in genre, is a bit of a cross between horror and comedy.  There are points where the imagery is truly grotesque and terrifying, and yet, there's just enough levity to keep things from being too intense.  Younger viewers will probably still be scared, though, because there's plenty to scare them.  Even I got a few chills at some points in the film, because it tickles so many of those little, irrational horrors we all still have from when we were kids, like suddenly falling into a hole, normal things coming to life and talking, creepy faces uttering menacing warnings from inside walls, and doors not leading where they're supposed to.  All of these things creep us out a little, even though we know they don't really happen.Overall, I really enjoyed this film.  It's not specifically-Christian, but neither is it evil or determined to tear away at our moral fiber, like so many modern movies.  It was an overall fun movie about a journey through a dark fantasy world where things don't make sense, with some good laughs, good visuals, good scares and good times, and I can't really ask for more than that.",4,"Bizarre, creepy, humorous and charming, with a subtle message",1339718400,"06 15, 2012",2012,5853,"['Once', 'time', 'was', 'decade', 'called', '1980s', 'decade', 'number', 'fantasy',

Johnson ""Three-time published author""","[3, 4]","I had an opportunity to meet Gates McFadden (Dr. Beverly Crusher of Star Trek fame) who choreographed this film, and she has nothing but positive things to say.  So does David Holman, Palm Springs resident, Emmy winner (1984 Olympics) and Jim Henson's co-producer on The Muppet Show.I was a fantasy addict as a child and could relate to Sarah.  Oddly enough I never paid much attention to David Bowie until this movie, although I'd certainly heard of him.  His naturally mismatched eyes and androgynous shape-changing reinventing personality/persona (""artistic promiscuity,"" he called it once in an interview) make him the ideal performer to portray the mysterious Jareth, who unfortunately gets kiddied up despite the off-the-scale sensuality.  Tormenting the one person who knows more about the Labyrinth than anyone, namely Hoggle?  Too Saturday-morning cartoon for me.  Sadly, all-powerful tyrants do make these kinds of mistakes, but Jareth was less the villain in my view and more an antagonist who had a reason for what he did, unless, like Dorothy, Sarah invented the whole thing in her mind.  Considering she was on the verge of womanhood, that would fit, and considering she resented her baby brother in teenage self-absorption, that would also fit.  There are actual spiritual Labyrinths that you walk, most notably in the Franciscan churches.  So Sarah's journey could have been a dream, except they never stated that expressly.Assuming that the whole Labyrinth existed and that Sarah's ordeal was real (as if what goes on in our minds isn't just as real more often than not), special effects aside, the Labyrinth's lessons are spiritual touchstones amounting to (a) Kindness rules, (b) Don't give up your dreams, but know the difference between dreams and fantasies, and (c) What the bleep do we know?And of course...it's just a show, I should really just relax.Still, it would have been nice if Jareth had been written a little less villainish and more mysterious.  Bowie's performance, however, breaks out of the script and gives us a glimpse of someone with an agenda, a mission that gets complicated by his attraction to Sarah.  It's an attraction he uses as another test, because clearly she is dazzled by him.  After hearing him sing, who wouldn't be?Sarah's courage (and Connelly's maturity) shines through as she does what must be done and puts her fantasy life in perspective.  One can imagine that after this Jareth would only admire her all the more.  That's why, nearly two decades after its release, the story still manages to captivate--well, that and the wonderful Muppet creatures, and Jim Henson's sensibilities.",5,A sadly overlooked jewel,1113177600,"04 11, 2005",2005,2642,"['had', 'opportunity', 'meet', 'Gates', 'McFadden', 'Dr.', 'Beverly', 'Crusher', 'Star', 'Trek', 'fame', 'who', 'choreographed', 'film', 'nothing', 'positive', 'things', 'say', 'So', 'David', 'Holman', 'Palm', 'Springs', 'resident', 'Emmy', 'winner', '1984', 'Olympics', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'co-producer', 'Muppet', 'Show.I', 'was', 'fantasy', 'addict', 'child', 'could', 'relate', 'Sarah', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'never', 'paid', 'much', 'attention', 'David', 'Bowie', 'movie', ""'d"", 'certainly', 'heard', 'naturally', 'mismatched', 'eyes', 'androgynous', 'shape-changing', 'reinventing', 'personality/persona', 'artistic', 'promiscuity', 'called', 'once', 'interview', 'make', 'ideal', 'performer', 'portray', 'mysterious', 'Jareth', 'who', 'unfortunately', 'kiddied', 'up', 'off-the-scale', 'sensuality', 'Tormenting', 'one', 'person', 'who', 'more', 'Labyrinth', 'anyone', 'namely', 'Hoggle', 'Too', 'Saturday-morning', 'cartoon', 'Sadly', 'all-powerful', 'tyrants', 'do', 'make', 'kinds', 'mistakes', 'Jareth', 'was', 'less', 'villain', 'view', 'more', 'antagonist', 'who', 'had', 'reason', 'what', 'did', 'Dorothy', 'Sarah', 'invented', 'whole', 'thing', 'mind', 'Considering', 'was', 'verge', 'womanhood', 'would', 'fit', 'considering', 'resented', 'baby', 'brother', 'teenage', 'self-absorption', 'would', 'also', 'fit', 'are', 'actual', 'spiritual', 'Labyrinths', 'walk', 'most', 'notably', 'Franciscan', 'churches', 'So', 'Sarah', 'journey', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'dream', 'never', 'stated', 'expressly.Assuming', 'whole', 'Labyrinth', 'existed', 'Sarah', 'ordeal', 'was', 'real', 'what', 'minds', ""n't"", 'just', 'real', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'special', 'effects', 'aside', 'Labyrinth', 'lessons', 'are', 'spiritual', 'touchstones', 'amounting', 'Kindness', 'rules', 'b', 'Do', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'dreams', 'know', 'difference', 'dreams', 'fantasies', 'c', 'What', 'bleep', 'do', 'know', 'course', 'just', 'show', 'should', 'really', 'just', 'relax.Still', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'Jareth', 'had', 'been', 'written', 'little', 'less', 'villainish', 'more', 'mysterious', 'Bowie', 'performance', 'however', 'script', 'glimpse', 'someone', 'agenda', 'mission', 'complicated', 'attraction', 'Sarah', 'attraction', 'test', 'clearly', 'dazzled', 'hearing', 'sing', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'Sarah', 'courage', 'Connelly', 'maturity', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'done', 'fantasy', 'life', 'perspective', 'One', 'can', 'imagine', 'Jareth', 'would', 'only', 'admire', 'more', 'why', 'nearly', 'two', 'decades', 'release', 'story', 'still', 'captivate', 'well', 'wonderful', 'Muppet', 'creatures', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'sensibilities']",N/A

Movies like ""The Princess Bride"", ""The Wizard of Oz"", ""Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"", and of course ""Labirynth"".  Unfortunately, Labirynth was one of those movies that I did not watch at all between the ages of six and twenty.  As a child, the film scared me, and I remembered it being a lot scarier than it actually is, and was hesitant but curious to watch it as an adult because of that.The interesting thing about Labyrinth is that it not just a children's film.  It has elements of a children's films, but it is so much more than that.The story revolves around Sarah (Jennifer Connelly), a sixteen year old girl who is tired of watching her baby brother on the weekends and spends her free time acting out plays.  So, one night after an argument with her stepmother, she runs into her room only to find her favorite teddy bear missing, blames it on her brother and wishes he were gone.  Only this time, by chance, she gives the command to let the goblins take her brother away only to regret it immediately.  After that it becomes a story of friendship, the power of imagination, faith, and the differences between a girl and woman.The puppets and the premise make it sound like a mere children's fairy tale, and although it is entertaining for children, it has proven itself worthy for the collection of adults as well.  The characters are fun and while our heroine is whiny and obnoxious at first, she quickly realizes that life isn't fair, and that's the way it is, so get over it!  She struggles to save her brother so he wont be a goblin forever, at the same time struggling with whether or not she'd like to become the goblin queen.  You would think that someone as thin and British as David Bowie wouldn't be so attractive in this role, but he is.  I couldn't imagine anyone else in the role.  He is very campy, but there is a delicate balance between an unreasonable villain and a man trying to win a woman's heart in the best way he knows; power.The music written by Bowie is first rate and truly elevates the movie to a level it wouldn't have reached otherwise.  Especially, ""As the World Falls Down"", which is one of the best sequences in the film.

All three of them set landmarks in the genre by showing great imagination and spectacular spirit of adventure. In the case of 'Labyrinth', a movie more intended for children would prove to be the most harsh of the three by touching a subject not very uncommon: stepping into adulthood and leaving infancy forever.Jim Henson had already delighted us with his magnificent film 'The Dark Crystal'. In this movie, he shows once again why he's one of the best puppeteers of the world. Although there are many characters in the film, only two of them are played by human actors. The rest is all puppets. This was Jennifer Conelly's first big role, and she does quite a nice job. The brave, yet sometimes overconfident Sarah manages to capture our attention even when surrounded by all the puppets and artistry of the magical world she's in, but it's David Bowie, as the Goblin King, who gets the best of the movie in a scene-stealing role. His presence alone is astonishing, and even when he could seem a little rigid in his acting moments, he feels right at home during the musical numbers, showing us why he was the one and only option for the part. I hadn't watched the movie in over 10 years, and I still loved all the songs, specially the ballroom sequence, where Sarah and the Goblin King face each other in a masquerade where the two of them are the only ones unmasked. In fact, the only musical piece that I didn't like was 'Wild Gang', basically because it doesn't feature Bowie (and the special effects are pretty lame). As for Henson's work, all the puppets are magnificent and brilliant in detail. This is specially good in the big ones, like Ludo the beast, the Helping Hands and the big robot-like creature at the gates of the Goblin City. Adults with a less 'delicate' sense of humor will crack up with the Bog of Eternal Stench.Unfortunately, once again, fans of a good film will feel betrayed with this edition: a poor presentation, an old documentary, absolutely no commentaries (one by Jennifer Connely and David Bowie would've been the greatest thing on Earth!!) and, worst of all, a mediocre transfer. There is basically no improvement over the VHS version, neither in picture quality nor sound. Bring me the head of the Lucasfilm executive who gave the OK on this paper-napkin edition! Being realistic, I don't think a Special Edition of 'Labyrinth' is planned in the near or far future, so you'll have to deal with this one.

It wasn't until I was 19 and I happened to describe this movie to a college friend who instantly recognized this movie as 'Labyrinth' and almost immediately we jumped up and drove to the local Walmart to pick this little number up!  I didn't even realize that Sarah was played by a young Jennifer Connelly until then.David Bowie is timeless and gorgeous in this film!  I love his glitzy costumes and everytime he appears on screen my breath hitches in my throat.  Bowie's not even from my generation and I'm a die-hard fan-girl of his.  His music is sublime in this film especially 'As the World Falls Down' in the fan favorite ballroom scene(the scene I used to describe the movie when I forgot its name). I also like 'Within You', 'Underground', 'Chilly Down', and of course 'Magic Dance'!

Her character goes through some growth from the start to finish of the movie.  She starts out as a selfish, bratty, immature teenaged girl whose tired of her baby brother, Tobey, cramping her life.  She wishes him to be taken away by unknowingly declaring the 'magic words' and before she knows it the Goblin King(Bowie) grants her wish.  Realizing what she's done she strikes a deal with the duplicitous king and enters the labyrinth as she races against time to save her brother or he will forever remain in the Goblin King's clutches. Along the way she meets and befriends some interesting characters to aid(or sidetrack) her in her journey.Some may say this movie will have either creeped you out as a kid or seems too strange and corny to watch as an adult. I disagree. This is a fun film to watch and if you've seen it as a kid and watch it as an adult you will be hit with a wave of nostalgia!

Obviously cos I'm older now. I always wanted to be Sarah when I was young.When I watch this movie as an adult (and find David Bowie extremely distracting from the waist down), I think it's a shame that it's rated U. There's so much chemistry between Jared (David Bowie) & Sarah (Jennifer Connelly), especially in the ballroom scene, and you find if it hadn't been rated a U, then their relationship could have developed more. But then, they probably would have had to get an older actress instead of Jennifer Connelly, as she would have been 15 or 16 at the time of making. There seems to be an instant attraction between the two characters, but maybe someone should have pointed out he's got a sock stuffed down there - I've seen a lot better and more subtle 'packages' than that! *drool*David Bowie does 5 original songs for the soundtrack of this, and during the 56 minute documentary which is included in the extras, you see him singing the end credits track ""Underground"". He also sings ""Magic Dance"", ""Chilly Down"", ""As The World Falls Down"", and ""Within You"".All the characters that feature in the labyrinth, also feature as toys in Sarah's room in the beginning. She has a stuffed animal that looks like Sir Didymus on her shelves, a doll that looks like Ludo near her window, a Firey doll on a shelf, a statue of Hoggle as a bookend, and a figurine of Jareth the Goblin King on the right hand side of her desk. Also, the dress that she wears in the ballroom scene is the same as the one on her musicbox doll, and the marble labyrinth game is the same as the hedge maze that comes later.One of the worst scenes that stopped this being a 5, is the scene which features those Firey creatures, who throw their heads about. I'll give them credit where it's due, because it was 1986, but when you get older, you can see the outlines! I was never that keen on Sir Didymus either. His voice is really grating. This scene was unnecessary and should have been scrapped.The whole film is basically about Sarah changing from a young girl into a woman. Her older man crush on David Bowie disappears along with all her toys into a drawer, only to be pulled out years later.My favourite characters? I was never that keen on Ludo as a child, but watching him now reminds of Niall from The Young Ones. My other favourite is the little worm that speaks to Sarah at the start, he reminded me of the Glo-Worms I had as a child. And he made Sarah go the wrong way!The film is very similar in ways to Alice In Wonderland, which was never one of my favourite stories. Too many characters, who didn't really do a lot. The characters in this don't have the same fate, and instead, the only characters who are unnecessary are those fiery head throwing characters.I will always love this movie, but I think I'll stick with the copy I have. The collector's edition has more stuff in it, but not stuff I'm really interested in. I've yet to see Dark Crystal as well, but I reckon the reason I love this movie so much is because I wanted to be Sarah, then & now. The documentary is well worth watching, the best bit, is Jennifer & David having a laugh in their ballroom costumes.

197341,A182CY2NWMR6XT,6300151379,"Miguel ""Writer, Journalist, Film Critic""","[3, 3]","I still cannot believe how many people do not know that this movie exists. I wonder if this film would have ever been released if it was not for the current trend in cult releases on DVD and tape. It may not be the best movie ever made, but it is definitely one of the best fantasy films of modern cinema.Sure, maybe some of the effects may be dated by today's standards or the film may have been marketed for children, but ... who cares? The work on the design of this production alone should have won it several awards, David Bowie's performance still stands out as incredible, and the story itself is a lot deeper than most will admit. But hey, at least that fact has not hurt the film's popularity. Only something as well done as this could withstand the tests of time in a film industry like ours.Regardless of anyone who might disagree as to how good or bad Labyrinth is, no one can deny it's power to generate a fan base that could survive without any means to purchase a copy for so long. Only something that can touch people's hearts and minds could do something like that. The eighties heralded so many well done fantasy productions that I wish it would become a filmmaking trend again someday.Labyrinth, The Never Ending Story, The Princess Bride, Return to Oz, and Legend were truly some of the most painstakingly detailed, amazingly directed, and beautifully scored films that I can think of. I may have originally viewed them as a young child, but over the years not one of them has disappeared from my memories. As one grows older one forgets the unmemorable, but not works of art like these. After just viewing Labyrinth again, I can see that even though I've grown and I've learned many things about filmmaking itself, this movie still amazes me. Even if some have a problem with the pace or are avid haters of muppets, they should sit down and give this film a chance. At times it almost seems as if the characters in the film are just walking through a wonderfully done canvas of colors, and I am not talking about the matte paintings.There are points where the viewer just forgets that they are even viewing a film and become mesmerized by the music, visuals, and feel of Labyrinth. One might think that Bowie's music, having been a fad of the eighties, would have also been awkward after a decade or so, but that is not the case either. The music just seems to fit as if it were never part of the real world at all but just more of what one would expect from mischievous goblins out to have fun or Jareth's attempts at wooing the heroine.If I had to pick one thing about this film that will truly leave anyone in awe, it is the ballroom sequence.

She immerses herself in a world of fairytale fantasy to forget her day-to-day strife, and rehearses lines from books in the hope of one day becoming a great actress like her real mother. But on one particularly stormy night, Sarah is left alone to tend to her baby brother yet again, and the assignment is more than she can bear. She finally makes a hasty wish for the infant to be taken away by goblins, to trouble her no more! --- Her wish is granted. --- Sarah suddenly finds herself alone in a fairy kingdom on a magical quest to save her brother, journeying beyond the gates of the goblin city and to the castle of the very Goblin King himself, but to get there she first must solve the Labyrinth!From fantasy masters Jim Henson and George Lucas comes a film that delighted a generation! Labyrinth is a magical fantasy  that combines the Wizard of Oz, Alice In Wonderland, and the Return of the Jedi, with an 80's twist in the form of David Bowie's one of a kind musical style. The film follows Sarah's transformation from bratty teenage girl to sympathetic and endearing heroine, as she makes her way through all the traps and twists the Goblin King sets before her, picking up new friends as she goes, from the ugly but good-hearted dwarf, Hoggle, and an enormous, hairy simpleton called Ludo, to brave Sir Didymus the fox and his noble steed, Ambrosius the dog. Almost the entire cast is direct from Jim Henson's creature shop, featuring an assortment of weirdies and baddies the likes of which you've hopefully never seen. And there's more magic still, thanks to the sorcery of Jareth, the Goblin King, portrayed beautifully by the hypnotic personage of David Bowie. Jennifer Connelly holds her own as Sarah though, looking more beautiful than I have ever seen her, and far too hot to be the staying at home and reading Tolkien on a Friday-night type, but we'll let that slide in lieu of the gorgeous eye-candy. If Henson and Lucas were aiming for a timeless classic here, ala ""The Wizard of Oz,"" they may have missed the mark, as the music of the film dates it as unmistakably 80's. Nevertheless, it is without a doubt a masterpiece of filmmaking in true Jim Henson style, a great trip for the 80's fantasy enthusiast, and an excellent piece of fantasy entertainment for anyone who is a fan of the genre. More than a few elements from the world of Harry Potter were clearly inspired by this film, just as it was inspired by the classic fantasies that came before it. ""Labyrinth"" is a true work of art, and a true milestone of fantasy entertainment!The DVD is in widescreen, featuring a fullscreen theatrical trailer, and a long and informative behind the scenes featurette that includes interviews with the performers and creators, not to mention more lovely footage of Jennifer Connelly.

In 'Labyrinth' Jennifer Connoly is a typical teen, torn between adults that don't understand her and her baby brother that she resents having to babysit for.  Her flitting wish for her brother to be spirited away by goblins comes true though, and an 'Alice In Wonderland'-type story follows when she realises her responsibilities.The best thing that this movie has going for is probably Jennifer Connoly, a fantastic actress that's finally beginning to make it in Hollywood after performances in 'Requiem For A Dream' and 'A Beautiful Mind'.  Here she manages just the right amount of angst, frustration and vulnerability of our teenage heroine.  David Bowie plays the goblin king in a shameless role of self-promotion, but since the goblin king is over-the-top anyway, this actually kind of fits.  The world itself meanwhile is absolutely magical.  Created by Jim Henson's Creature Workshop, it's dazzling to watch.  Thankfully it's completely free of cutesy creatures - everything in 'Labyrinth' is ugly, evil or both.  I particularly liked the small ogre at the beginning that kills the dainty little fairies.  There are also some relatively troubling ideas here to say that this is often referred to as a children's movie.  For instance, the Escher-like hands that reach out of the wall and several menacing creatures along the way.Alongside this totally immersing fantasy world though, are side-issues of the journey of adolescense which, whilst clear, are never rammed down your throat.

I thought he was the strangest, sickest thing to happen to youth culture since KISS and Arthur Brown! Then he abandoned Ziggy Stardust and became the Thin White Duke, and he was at least listenable. Somehow, between here and the release of ""Station to Station"", he became homogenized and pasteurized enough to star in a family movie, and ""Labyrinth"" was it!""Labyrinth"" is the story of a girl, Sarah, played by Jennifer Connelly, (before she was deemed Oscar-worthy,) and her confrontation with Jareth, king of the goblins. Sarah is a girl who is heavily into her childhood fantasy world: fairy princesses, goblins, dwarves and talking worms. After having to deal with her unwanted stepmother one day, she wishes her infant half-brother into oblivion, calling for the goblin-king, (Bowie,) to take him away. Regretting it almost immediately, she then goes off on an adventure to retrieve him from Jareth, at Jareth's own challenge. Along the way, she meets and befriends Hoggle, a dwarf; Ludo, a huge, dimwitted ogre who can command rocks to do his bidding and Sir Didemus, a fox with delusions of knighthood.The art direction for this movie is what makes it. It immediately, like ""The Dark Crystal, puts a baby boomer in mind of some of the better holiday family specials of the fifties, like ""The Musicians of Bremen"", or the Hallmark Hall of Fame's production of ""The Pied Piper of Hamelin"", not to mention ""Shirley Temple's Storybook"". A LOT of work went into this production, work like they don't do for fantasy movies anymore! None of it is computer generated, and the sets all seem to be life-size. The Henson organization put out some incredible stuff while the man was still alive, and this is one of the better things they did.Bowie does a few songs in the movie. One, ""Dance, Magic, Dance"", or whatever it's called, is actually pretty catchy, as well as ""I'm Underground"", pretty much the title tune. Interesting note: Danny John-Jules, who played ""Katt"" on ""Red Dwarf"", provides the voice of one of the ""Fieries"" in a throwaway sequence in the middle of the film.You could do worse, if you can get past the fact that David Bowie has to be, hands down, the scourge of Western Civilization....",4,Henson strikes again!,1178928000,"05 12, 2007",2007,2252,"['early', 'seventies', 'HATED', 'David', 'Bowie', 'thought', 'was', 'strangest', 'sickest', 'thing', 'happen', 'youth', 'culture', 'KISS', 'Arthur', 'Brown', 'Then', 'abandoned', 'Ziggy', 'Stardust', 'became', 'Thin', 'White', 'Duke', 'was', 'least', 'listenable', 'Somehow', 'here', 'release', 'Station', 'Station', 'became', 'homogenized', 'pasteurized', 'enough', 'star', 'family', 'movie', 'Labyrinth', 'was', 'Labyrinth', 'story', 'girl', 'Sarah', 'played', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'was', 'deemed', 'Oscar-worthy', 'confrontation', 'Jareth', 'king', 'goblins', 'Sarah', 'girl', 'who', 'heavily', 'childhood', 'fantasy', 'world', 'fairy', 'princesses', 'goblins', 'dwarves', 'talking', 'worms', 'having', 'deal', 'unwanted', 'stepmother', 'one', 'day', 'infant', 'half-brother', 'oblivion', 'calling', 'goblin-king', 'Bowie', 'take', 'away', 'Regretting', 'almost', 'immediately', 'then', 'off', 'adventure', 'retrieve', 'Jareth', 'Jareth', 'own', 'challenge', 'way', 'Hoggle', 'dwarf', 'Ludo', 'huge', 'dimwitted', 'ogre', 'who', 'can', 'command', 'rocks', 'do', 'bidding', 'Sir', 'Didemus', 'fox', 'delusions', 'knighthood.The', 'art', 'direction', 'movie', 'what', 'immediately', 'Dark', 'Crystal', 'baby', 'boomer', 'mind', 'better', 'holiday', 'family', 'specials', 'fifties', 'Musicians', 'Bremen', 'Hallmark', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'production', 'Pied', 'Piper', 'Hamelin', 'not', 'mention', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'Storybook', 'LOT', 'work', 'went', 'production', 'work', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'fantasy', 'movies', 'anymore', 'None', 'computer', 'generated', 'sets', 'seem', 'be', 'life-size', 'Henson', 'organization', 'put', 'out', 'incredible', 'stuff', 'man', 'was', 'still', 'alive', 'one', 'better', 'things', 'did.Bowie', 'few', 'songs', 'movie', 'One', 'Dance', 'Magic', 'Dance', 'whatever', 'called', 'actually', 'pretty', 'catchy', 'as', 'well', ""'m"", 'Underground', 'pretty', 'much', 'title', 'tune', 'Interesting', 'note', 'Danny', 'John-Jules', 'who', 'played', 'Katt', 'Red', 'Dwarf', 'voice', 'one', 'Fieries', 'throwaway', 'sequence', 'middle', 'film.You', 'could', 'do', 'worse', 'can', 'get', 'fact', 'David', 'Bowie', 'be', 'down', 'scourge', 'Western', 'Civilization']",N/A

197371,A2DLKD4AC5JV5Q,6300151379,Ranny Levy,"[0, 0]","KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, Hunter Willow Jones shares her review of this film with us:I love how creative it is!It is the story of Sara (Jennifer Connelly), who is sick of having to watch her infant step-brother, Toby.  She wishes that the goblin king would come and take him away and unbelievably her wish comes true.  The Goblin King, Jareth (David Bowie) arrives at her house and tells her she has thirteen hours to get Toby back, but she has to go through a massive labyrinth.  If she fails to do so, Jareth will keep Toby forever and turn him into a goblin.  Sara regrets her wish.  So she decides she must go through the labyrinth.  Throughout her journey she meets many friends and near death experiences.  She also learns not to take things for granted.I really like how the movie is creative.  I think having puppets as main characters is really cool.  Jim Henson, the creator of Kermit the Frog, wrote, directed and did the puppetry.  I also like the setting a lot.  It goes with the story line and makes the movie feel mystical.  The set has so many cool ideas.  When Sara first comes into the labyrinth, a worm tells her to go through the wall and take a chance.  It looks like there is no way to get through, but when she decides to go through she finds that there are more ways for her to go.  The best part of the movie is the music by David Bowie.

This movie alternates between childlike scenes with puppets and very grown-up Cinderella fantasy sequences that will unearth your long-forgotten wishes to be a princess.Sarah is leaving the world of toys to become a woman. She retains the belief that no one can have power over her mind and she plays out her fantasy by at first being a spoiled brat and then realizing her responsibilities.When she wishes for her brother to disappear, her wish is granted. She must then navigate through an ""Alice in Wonderland"" style Labyrinth paradise filled with fantastical creatures and helpful puppets. There are scenes where we believe Sarah has met with certain doom, however the puppets lead her back to safety.David Bowie is featured as the Goblin King and his playful taunting enhances the lighthearted aspect of his relationship with Sarah. When they are dancing in the ""bubble fantasy"" she still seems too young to be his love interest, but there is a definite chemistry to the connection. It seems to be a story of a woman emerging and yet still holding onto her love of fantasy and magic.Throughout the movie we find David Bowie singing and the scenes of the staircases are quite fascinating because you never know where he will appear from next. There is a true sense of danger as Sarah tries to save her brother.Enjoyable if you can become a child again while viewing this movie. The English humor is quite funny in places and I especially loved the knight on his horse who protected the bridge.If you have any interest in puppets, David Bowie's music or fantasy castles, then this may amuse you. The costumes are beyond amazing and yes: ""I want that dress."" ~&lt;:) Princess dreams.If you enjoyed Star Wars or Lord of the Rings, this is a much more playful movie.

Return To Oz, The Neverending Story, Legend, The Dark Crystal, etc. Each of them have a charming and captivating quality that fantasy adventure flicks of the last 2 decades don't possess. Same goes for the 1986 Jim Henson classic Labyrinth.Loosely based on Maurice Sendak's children's book Outside Over There, Labyrinth follows spoiled 15 year old Sarah (played by a young Jennifer Connelly) who's too obsessed with fairy tales and her stuffed bear Lancelot to think about others. The immature brat whines and complains about having to babysit her baby brother Toby while her father and stepmother go out on a date. Wishing to be rid of the screaming infant, Sarah calls for the Goblin King to take the child away forever. Turns out he's not just a character in a fairy tale, because King Jareth himself (the glammed out David Bowie) grants her wish and baby Toby vanishes. Immediately regretting what she's done, Sarah is told that she must travel through the Labyrinth to rescue him within 13 hours. If she fails, little Toby will become a goblin forever. No pressure, right?The Labyrinth is a ginormous, mind-boggling maze with so many twists and turns that will make your head spin. Invisible pathways within walls, dead ends that switch from one area to the next, and several traps. Along the way, Sarah befriends the curmudgeonly, jewelry loving gnome Hoggle, large yet lovable creature Ludo, and tiny fox-life knight with loads of courage Sir Didymus. Fearing the girl might succeed, Jareth places several pitfalls to defeat or distract Sarah from her goal.I have to say the whole look of the film from the Escher-styled sets to the Muppets themselves are fantastic. Quirky, offbeat, and reminiscent of the darkness surrounding the timeless fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm. The soundtrack is amazing as well. The funky opener and closer Underground, silly sing-a-long Magic Dance, and lissome Within You. The best song hands down is the dreamy As the World Falls Down. My absolute favorite scene (and I've got alot of them!).The dvd extras are top notch too with the behind the scenes documentary Inside the Labyrinth revealing how the special effects were pulled off. Did you know that Michael Jackson was originally considered for the role of Jareth? It would've been interesting to see how the late King of Pop would've portrayed the character, but Bowie was tailor made for it imo.Inspired by The Wizard of Oz and Alice in Wonderland, Labyrinth is an original and underrated fantasy adventure movie that will enthrall children and adults alike.

He, being strangely in love with her, is only too happy to oblige, and sends out his goblin followers to snatch the baby. To Sarah's horror, she finds that her fantasy world is all too real, and to save Toby from being changed into a goblin, she must accept Jareth's deal: to rescue Toby she must travel through the labyrinth to the goblin city at it's centre. On the way she is joined by such friends as Hoggle the dwarfish creature with a big heart hidden behind a gruff exterior, Ludo the large, loveable 'monster' who can call the rocks, and Didymus the knightly fox on his steed - the sheepdog Ambrosius.This is a family movie, with lots of laughs and thrills, brilliant costumes and set designs, and Jim Henson's puppets are still amazing to watch preform. But adults might pick up on the subtle similarities between Sarah's 'real' world and her 'Labyrinth' world, recognising the theme of reality and illusion. For instance, some of the toys in her room bear the same resemblances to Hoggle, Ludo and Didymus, Jareth is identified with the white owl that follows Sarah around the park, both Sarah's dog Merlin and Didymus's dog Ambrosius are English Sheepdogs, in Jareth's 'dream sequence' Sarah wears the same dress as the dancer in her music box, Sarah comes across the image of her own room in a dump-heap while in the Labyrinth, and at the climax of the movie she directly quotes her book 'The Labyrinth' in her final defense against Jareth.So this movie is not just a kid's fantasy movie, it requires lots of 'reading between the lines' to pick up on the intended similarities between the real world, and the one that Sarah creates.To end with Sarah's own quote, from her book 'The Labyrinth': ""Give me the child. Through hardships untold and dangers un-numbered I have fought my way here to the castle beyond the goblin city to take back the child that you have stolen. For my will is as strong as yours, and my kingdom is great. You have no power over me.""",5,Reality vs Illusion,1016409600,"03 18, 2002",2002,2737,"['Labyrinth', 'young', 'girl', 'called', 'Sarah', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'who', 'two', 'different', 'worlds-', 'real', 'world', 'where', 'mother', 'not', 'present', 'life', 'stepmother', 'baby', 'brother', 'Toby', 'forced', 'baby-sit', 'other', 'world', 'fantasy', 'world', 'created', 'Princess', 'pets', 'toys', 'storybook', 'characters', 'teddy', 'bear', 'called', 'Launcelot', 'dog', 'called', 'Merlin', 'stuffed', 'toys', 'lines', 'favourite', 'book', 'Labyrinth', 'obvious', 'two', 'worlds', 'prefers.One', 'night', 'babysitting', 'however', 'exasperation', 'brother', 'invoke', 'goblin', 'king', 'Jareth', 'David', 'Bowie', 'take', 'brother', 'away', 'being', 'strangely', 'love', 'only', 'too', 'happy', 'oblige', 'out', 'goblin', 'followers', 'snatch', 'baby', 'Sarah', 'horror', 'fantasy', 'world', 'too', 'real', 'save', 'Toby', 'being', 'changed', 'goblin', 'must', 'accept', 'Jareth', 'deal', 'rescue', 'Toby', 'must', 'travel', 'labyrinth', 'goblin', 'city', 'centre', 'way', 'joined', 'such', 'friends', 'Hoggle', 'dwarfish', 'creature', 'big', 'heart', 'hidden', 'gruff', 'exterior', 'Ludo', 'large', 'loveable', ""'monster"", 'who', 'can', 'call', 'rocks', 'Didymus', 'knightly', 'fox', 'steed', 'sheepdog', 'Ambrosius.This', 'family', 'movie', 'lots', 'laughs', 'thrills', 'brilliant', 'costumes', 'set', 'designs', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'puppets', 'are', 'still', 'amazing', 'watch', 'preform', 'adults', 'might', 'pick', 'up', 'subtle', 'similarities', 'Sarah', ""'real"", 'world', ""'Labyrinth"", 'world', 'recognising', 'theme', 'reality', 'illusion', 'instance', 'toys', 'room', 'same', 'resemblances', 'Hoggle', 'Ludo', 'Didymus', 'Jareth', 'identified', 'white', 'owl', 'Sarah', 'park', 'Sarah', 'dog', 'Merlin', 'Didymus', 'dog', 'Ambrosius', 'are', 'English', 'Sheepdogs', 'Jareth', ""'dream"", 'sequence', 'Sarah', 'same', 'dress', 'dancer', 'music', 'box', 'Sarah', 'image', 'own', 'room', 'dump-heap', 'while', 'Labyrinth', 'climax', 'movie', 'directly', 'book', 'Labyrinth', 'final', 'defense', 'Jareth.So', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'kid', 'fantasy', 'movie', 'lots', ""'reading"", 'lines', 'pick', 'up', 'intended', 'similarities', 'real', 'world', 'one', 'Sarah', 'creates.To', 'end', 'Sarah', 'own', 'quote', 'book', 'Labyrinth', 'Give', 'child', 'hardships', 'untold', 'dangers', 'un-numbered', 'have', 'fought', 'way', 'here', 'castle', 'goblin', 'city', 'take', 'back', 'child', 'have', 'stolen', 'will', 'as', 'strong', 'yours', 'kingdom', 'great', 'have', 'power']",N/A

This Henson/Lucas production isn't quite what you'd expect from these legendary directors. Somehow, it's better.The genius of Henson and Lucas shines brightly as Jennifer Connelly and David Bowie perpetuate this wonderful tale of fantasy written by Dennis Lee and Jim Henson. Henson's son, Brian (now the head of the Henson Empire), even gets in on the act as the voice of Hoggle.The story opens in the present, this world, this plane. Sarah (Connelly) is a spoiled rotten little drama queen who thinks she is the center of the universe and the sun around which the world revolves.In a brattish fit of colossal immaturity, she stumbles upon the correct words to summon Jareth the Goblin King (Bowie) to take her little brother to the Goblin Realm.Once done; however, she realizes how angry her parents will be and decides that it's more prudent to go ""rescue"" Toby rather than allow his assimilation into the Goblin fold.Jareth gives her 13 hours in which to find her way through an impossible labyrinth, fight her way through the Goblin City, and puzzle out the staircases of the Goblin Castle and save her half-brother.She is punished for arrogance, beguiled in her naivety, confused in her indecision and imprisoned for her quick, thoughtless decisions. ""That's not FAIR!"" is one of her most used and best delivered lines; used again and again, until it FINALLY sinks in that life just isn't fair.It is a warm, funny and enriching tale, once started. It's about growing up, accepting responsibility for your actions and choices and making them more wisely in the beginning, rather than cleaning up your messes as you go along.In the end, Sarah realizes all the infantile tantrums and childish toys are nothing but detritial remains of her otherwise out-lived childhood. She begins to stumble upon the reality that the important things are family, friends, and the responsibility that comes with making mature decisions. She throws away her immaturity and child-like selfishness to save her brother and thereby sets her feet back on the right path to adulthood and maturity.It's a wonderful ""coming of age"" movie, and perfect for its target audience: girls 9-13. But I must say that children and adults alike love this movie, worldwide. It's not ONLY for girls, but for anyone who loves fantasy. This movie is far superior to what most consider to be your standard ""Muppet Movie."" It's one of my favorites.",5,Goblin King! Goblin King!

She's running out of time an she has to end this labyrinth.

197413,A3FEQXNCFC68KC,6300151379,"SRFireside ""ZOOM!""","[259, 271]","In the early 80's Jim Henson created one of the most ambitious fantasy films ever: The Dark Crystal. It was a movie that had a completely realized world with its own creatures and flora... and it was performed entirely by puppets. Not the Muppet kind that Henson is famous for, mind you. These were serious creations that involved serious innovations in animatronics. While many loved the movie and it was critically acclaimed many others didn't ""get it"". There was no human interaction in the movie whatsoever and that put off people. Also the movie was serious with none of that Muppet mayhem Henson fans are so used to. That put off a few more people.The next evolutionary step in Jim's grand scheme of fantasy puppetry was Labyrinth, and they filled in the gaps that The Dark Crystal left for those who couldn't (or wouldn't) ""get"" the concept of a fully realized fantasy setting that is outside of our own. How does he do it? Let me tell you...Step One - Human actors. Labyrinth included the young, yet already talented Jennifer Connelly as their heroine and well-established musician and actor David Bowie as her nemesis. Now you get the fun of a complete puppet world while at the same time you have human characters that interact in that same environment. Thus giving the viewer a better connection to the puppet characters.Step Two - Better puppets. The Dark Crystal is a masterpiece in of itself, however the technology used to animate the puppets was in its infancy and if you had to be picky about it you can pick away at the limitations of the puppets in that movie. With Labyrinth you get updated technology, which gives you puppets who can show emotions better. Case in point is the goblin Hoggle, who is the starring puppet. So much attention to detail went into his facial expressions that you can actually see the fear, disgust, anger, and joy in his eyes. Add to that other puppetry innovations and you have a world of cool puppets.Step Three - Keep it fun. The Dark Crystal was a grandiose and serious film that included some funny moments now and then. Labyrinth is the opposite. Is a fun film where the characters meet up with unexpected and often times crazy situations. Makes this fantasy adventure feel more comical in the same way it would reading a fun bedtime story.Step Four - Keep the original concept. Jim Henson did The Dark Crystal with the thought that he wanted to create a whole different world inhabited by beings and creatures portrayed entirely by puppets. Labyrinth is essentially the same thing, but done in a different way. Walking through the movie's namesake (the maze that leads to the goblin city) is definitely like being in another world that's both fascinating and fun. Much of what you see is visually impressive and essentially relish in the fact your eyes can play tricks on you. Brian Froud is again signed on as the conceptual designer and his work shines just as well in this iteration as it did with Dark Crystal.Labyrinth also has the destinction of having songs specially written for the movie by David Bowie. Keep in mind this movie was in the 80's so what you get is 80's Bowie, and there are a couple scenes that flow more like music videos (or musical numbers) than standard scenes.You might get the impression I am dogging on Dark Crystal in order to lift up Labyrinth. Can't be farther from the truth. However I do know the differences between the two films and how the other was made in response to the first. Labyrinth is the folk tale while Dark Crystal is the fantasy book. I believe both are fantastic movies.The original DVD for Labyrinth was a good compilation right from the start, and was superseded with the Anniversary Edition having remastered visuals and a couple new featurettes. Now we have the movie on Blu-Ray, and boy I thought the Anniversay Edition looked good. I was worried when this movie went high definition that a lot of the original film grain was going to be lost in the digital cleaning that's popular with some companies with older films. Luckily what you end up with is the best looking picture to date. I'm not going to say this movie is presented in supersharp crystal clarity, but then again that would ruin it. The movie look as true to the original theatrical release as you can get. Details really pop out without looking antiseptic. Visually the Blu-Ray does breath new life into this classic. The extras are pretty much identical to what was offered on the Anniversary Edition with one exception. Here's what you get:Documentary Making of the Labyrinth - Has interviews with actors, puppet performers and production staff including Jim Henson, Brian Henson, David Bowie (who gives us some insight on his character) and Jennifer Connelly as well as lots of details on design and production of the movie. This documentary is a gem for those of you want solid behind-the-scenes details and was in the original DVD and is included on the Anniversary Edition.Journey Through the Labyrinth: Kingdom of Characters and The Quest for Golden City - These two featurettes from the Anniversary Edition include updated interviews with the cast and crew and never before seen footage from the Jim Henson archives. Kingdom of Characters focuses on... you guessed it... the main characters in the movie including conceptual design for the puppets (although Hoggle seems to be mostly left out, likely because there is so much of him in the original documentary) and background info on the actors. The Quest for the Golden City is mostly design details on the labyrinth, Goblin City and castle itself. These featurettes do well to fill in the gaps left by the original documentary. The extra footage is test footage of the puppets and such, with some production footage as well. I noticed some of the production footage was a rehash of what's on Making of the Labyrinth, but the crosstalk is few and far between.The Storytellers Picture-in-Picture: This is the Blu-Ray exclusive featurette. When you turn it on while watching the movie occasionally a window pops up with an interview with one of the crew members speaking some interesting anecdote about the film. There isn't a whole lot of these that pop up in the movie, but when they do you get some rather interesting and entertaining production and behind the scenes information. Hearing about the casting call for the Helping Hands scene and the interview with Warwick Davis are alone worth checking out the feature.Commentary by Brian FroudYou also get Dolby True HD Surround in English, French, Portugese with a Dolby Digigal Spanish track (how many movies have a Portugese dub?) with subtitles in all. Kind of strange they left out the Japanese audio that the Anniversary Edition had. I recall hearing improvements from the previous release's Dolby Digital 5.1 mix, but nothing groundbreaking.Every release of Labyrinth has been impressive from the very first DVD, and with each new release it gets even better. So is it worth the double/triple dip? Well just like how the Anniversary Edition gave you a better picture with more extras the Blu-Ray ups the ante. I say if you want to enjoy this movie in the best way visually then yes. The new extras are nice, but to be honest as long as they original making of documentary is in there everything else will always come in second.Labyrinth is a wonderful movie for all ages. The visuals will impress and the hijinks will entertain. If you are a Muppet fan this movie will be much more accessable than the Dark Crystal, and if you like The Storyteller then you have abolustely no choice but to get this (it's like a full length Storyteller movie sans John Hurt).",5,Fairy tale fun at its finest; UPDATED REVIEW FOR BLU-RAY,1185753600,"07 30, 2007",2007,7654,"['early', '80', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'created', 'one', 'most',

197414,ANO0XQ6XSIEVJ,6300151379,"Steven W. Hill ""Owner of shillpages.com""","[5, 6]","An exercise in imagination that would never be made today, LABYRINTH comes from the fertile creativity of Terry Jones, Brian Froud and Jim Henson. Jones is an accomplished fairy tale writer (and his comedic talents honed  on Monty Python's Flying Circus are a plus to the script). Froud's designs  are intricate and lifelike. Henson and his gang of puppeteers do an amazing  job putting the whole thing together. The visuals are always interesting,  and sometimes breathtaking.Slightly less interesting (than the visuals)  are the two lead roles. Jennifer Connelly is Sarah, a 14-year-old girl who  carelessly wishes her baby brother to be taken by the goblins. This film  comes early in her career and she clearly has great talent, but there are a  few shaky moments. David Bowie is the Goblin King and he seems to put less  than total effort into the role. We KNOW he can act, and act very well, but  perhaps he's not treating the role with respect? Despite those minor  quibbles, both actors WERE good choices and do fit the roles well.The  film does have its share of genius... the &quot;helping hands&quot; for  example are brief but wonderful (and unforgettable). The puppetry is  amazing. Sadly, we'll probably never see filmmaking like this again as it  becomes easier and cheaper to do things with computer graphics.The DVD  documentary is an extra-special treat. It's an hour long and covers  everything in great detail. It's especially interesting (naturally) to see  how the puppets are operated.

197417,A1W68QUF8TLJ98,6300151379,"T. Callahan ""*Um...A Signature?*""","[3, 3]","In many ways Labyrinth could be considered the finale of the two part Jim Henson Masterpiece Epic which began with the visually stunning The Dark Crystal.  While Crystal could easily be taken as Henson's answer to the then popular Star Wars, Labyrinth is all over his answer to the 80's - and who better to serve as ring master then David Bowie?A sort of grown up fairy tale Labyrinth is about a girl who, faced with the inevitable truth that she must one day soon leave the comfort of her fantasy world of games and make believe, must travel into the real life realm of magic and  fantasy to save her young brother from the Goblin King Jareth, and it is here that all the things she picked up playing dress up and reading Tolkein work to her advantage.  On the surface, Labyrinth is fun self indulgence on Bowie's part, as he's the only character who really gets to sing his synth heavy, sweeping score, but, as many Laby - Heads have already said, the film has a deeper message about growing up, not just how fun it is to watch Bowie prance around in tight leather riding pants.The puppetry is fantastic, but then this is Jim Henson we're talking about.  However, visually, the film lacks the depth and scope that the dark crystal brought.  Having seen the film only 3 times - once in the 80's, twice in the present - I found myself upon that second view a little dissapointed.  Certain scenes (Especially Magic Dance) which I remember brimming with puppets and on huge sets, are on a much smaller scale then I recalled - but that's a minor complaint I guess - Irrelevant even, because even if it lacks that kick in the balls scal eand scope of other Henson productions, it isn't a particularly bad thing.My only real complaint is the shortage of famous Muppet performers - Seriously Jimmy, would it have killed you and Frank to voice a few characters yourself?As an added bonus though, you get Kevin Clash in an early muppet appearance voicing a ""Fiery"" in the ""Chilly Down"" song.  He does his Elmo voice, which made me laugh :)Over all a good movie, and one that a lot of people grew up on.",4,"I'm Too Tired to Spell Check, so forgive any typos...",1154736000,"08 5, 2006",2006,2094,"['many', 'ways', 'Labyrinth', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'finale', 'two', 'part', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'Masterpiece', 'Epic', 'began', 'visually', 'stunning', 'Dark', 'Crystal', 'Crystal', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'taken', 'Henson', 'answer', 'then', 'popular', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Labyrinth', 'answer', '80', 'who', 'better', 'serve', 'ring', 'master', 'then', 'David', 'Bowie', 'A', 'sort', 'grown', 'up', 'fairy', 'tale', 'Labyrinth', 'girl', 'who', 'faced', 'inevitable', 'truth', 'must', 'one', 'day', 'soon', 'leave', 'comfort', 'fantasy', 'world', 'games', 'make', 'believe', 'must', 'travel', 'real', 'life', 'realm', 'magic', 'fantasy', 'save', 'young', 'brother', 'Goblin', 'King', 'Jareth', 'here', 'things', 'picked', 'up', 'playing', 'dress', 'up', 'reading', 'Tolkein', 'work', 'advantage', 'surface', 'Labyrinth', 'fun', 'self', 'indulgence', 'Bowie', 'part', 'only', 'character', 'who', 'really', 'sing', 'synth', 'heavy', 'sweeping', 'score', 'many', 'Laby', 'Heads', 'have', 'already', 'said', 'film', 'deeper', 'message', 'growing', 'up', 'not', 'just', 'how', 'fun', 'watch', 'Bowie', 'prance', 'around', 'tight', 'leather', 'riding', 'pants.The', 'puppetry', 'fantastic', 'then', 'Jim', 'Henson', ""'re"", 'talking', 'However', 'visually', 'film', 'depth', 'scope', 'dark', 'crystal', 'brought', 'Having', 'seen', 'film', 'only', '3', 'times', 'once', '80', 'twice', 'present', 'found', 'second', 'view', 'little', 'dissapointed', 'Certain', 'scenes', 'Especially', 'Magic', 'Dance', 'remember', 'brimming', 'puppets', 'huge', 'sets', 'are', 'much', 'smaller', 'scale', 'then', 'recalled', 'minor', 'complaint', 'guess', 'Irrelevant', 'even', 'even', 'kick', 'balls', 'scal', 'eand', 'scope', 'other', 'Henson', 'productions', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'bad', 'only', 'real', 'complaint', 'shortage', 'famous', 'Muppet', 'performers', 'Seriously', 'Jimmy', 'would', 'have', 'killed', 'Frank', 'voice', 'few', 'characters', 'added', 'bonus', 'get', 'Kevin', 'Clash', 'early', 'muppet', 'appearance', 'voicing', 'Fiery', 'Chilly', 'Down', 'song', 'Elmo', 'voice', 'made', 'good', 'movie', 'one', 'lot', 'people', 'grew', 'up']",N/A

Its fantastic characters and enchanting sets make this a beatiful and magical tale, which  could only be created by the artistic genius of Jim Henson's workshop. Now  with this Dvd release, the film has been given a new lease of energy.  The  improved picture quality really emphasises the films gorgeous colors,  really bringing to life the action. The script is blessed with the fantasy  of the 'Dark Crystal' (an equally brilliant movie) but  with the added  mayhem of the Muppet show,it is far more more light hearted.As is  standard with Jim Henson movies, there is a wonderful mixture of  characters, which interact together brilliantly.  The acting may not be the  best, but it is important to remember that Jennifer Connelly who plays  Sarah (the lead character)was only 14 when she made this movie and is  having to act with puppets which can't be easy. The great David Bowie gives  a convincig performance as the goblin king, providing musical interludes,  which admittedly, I found somewhat tedious as a youngster but enjoy now.

197419,A3C0WSRUOCD8IG,6300151379,That Review Guy,"[3, 3]","A guilty pleasure for me, Labyrinth is a made-for-kids movie with just enough weird stuff in it to appeal to teens (like a peeing goblin, a worm with a Cockney accent and an Escher-like chase scene). Not to mention that it was one of beautiful Jennifer Connelly's first starring roles. George Lucas produced and Muppet creator Jim Henson directed this adventure of a teenage girl who must venture into an enchanted labyrinth and castle to tangle with an evil sorcerer (David Bowie) and rescue her baby brother. Monty Python's Terry Jones co-wrote the script, and the great Elaine May reportedly took a pass at it as well. Bowie performs several songs.

This is quite strange, actually, but there exist certain works of literature and cinema, certain paintings also that happen, by accident or not, to approach very nearly some fundamental truths. Unrelated to each other, with the authors usually unaware what comes out as side effect, they stretch in a kind of string across the ages. The ancient Babylon had them, and medieval England, and England of Queen Victoria, and, hard as it is to believe in this desperate age, the United States in 1980s.I will not give examples: you, reading this, either already know what I'm talking about, or don't, and then you shouldn't bother. In brief, all such works deal with what we can call Man's Relation to the Strange - the comings and goings, the gestures, dangers and requirements of a rite of passage. The relation itself does not fundamentally change, but it dresses in metaphors congenial to the era. Before long we shall probably have a cyberpunk ""Labyrinth,"" where a hero or heroine finds her way through machine-land, resists its charms but carries back to the human world a diplomatic understanding. And an ability to call for help.And that's enough; like I said, either you know what I mean or not. The point of this review is to ask that you, Mr. Viewer, watch the movie VERY CAREFULLY and try to understand what each scene tries to accomplish and how. Not everything will make sense, there is a lot of sheer fun going on here, and laughs, and crazy puppets. Good things all, they keep up the mood. As I said, Henson hardly intended to make statements with the movie, other than that we need imagination in our daily lives, or something like that. But this is NOT what I'm talking about. Pay attention rather to the Labyrinth itself, to its challenges, to Sarah's responses. To the baby, too. What is the role of that toddler? Why is he completely passive - kidnapped, held, recovered, and nothing else? What does he stand for?Look for symbols with moderation, of course, and don't forget to have fun. The first time through you'll probably have nothing else. But neither should you forget that there is more to the picture.

197427,A96K1ZGW56S2I,6300151379,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[1, 1]","I love the work of Jim Henson. I enjoy watching the movies and television programs he produced and directed because he was a great film maker and puppeteer.  Many of his creations are loveable and some are stunning. However, the main reason I love the work of Jim Henson is because he was a great storyteller who he knew how to tell fairy tales right.Most people today get their idea of fairy tales from the watered down Disney variety. As much as I enjoy Disney films, it is sad that the true stories are being lost. Sadder still is that if people were to actully listen to and read fairy tales in the way they were meant to be listened to and read, the storyteller would be accused of being a sick and violent person (even though the society we live in is much more sick and violent).Jim Henson was not afraid of telling a story in the way it was meant to be told.  Jim Henson told fairy tales the right way.  Such is the case in LABYRINTH.LABYRINTH is sort of a modern day fairy tale. Sarah is selfish and doesn't want to babysit her crying baby brother. So, she wishes for the goblins to take him away. Did anyone ever tell you to be careful for what you wish for because it might come true? Well, that's just what happens here. The goblins steal Sarah's brother, Toby, and take him to the castle in the goblin city. Sarah can save her brother, but only if she can successfuly navigate the labyrinth that leads to the city in a short amount of time.  Sarah begins the quest and in doing so meets up with several loveable, frightening, and confusing creatures.  They have several adventures which ultimately lead to Sarah's confrontation with the Goblin King.LABYRINTH is a delightful fairy tale adventure. It has scary monsters, a fight against evil, and a moral lesson.  Children will enjoy watching it. However, I think adults may enjoy it even more because they will understand the parrell between the &quot;fantasy world&quot; and Sarah's (and perhaps your own) real life.",4,&quot;A Fairy Tale Told Right&quot;,978652800,"01 5, 2001",2001,1980,"['love', 'work', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'movies', 'television', 'programs', 'produced', 'directed', 'was', 'great', 'film', 'maker', 'puppeteer', 'Many', 'creations', 'are', 'loveable', 'are', 'stunning', 'However', 'main', 'reason', 'love', 'work', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'was', 'great', 'storyteller', 'who', 'knew', 'how', 'tell', 'fairy', 'tales', 'right.Most', 'people', 'today', 'get', 'idea', 'fairy', 'tales', 'watered', 'down', 'Disney', 'variety', 'As', 'much', 'enjoy', 'Disney', 'films', 'sad', 'true', 'stories', 'are', 'being', 'lost', 'Sadder', 'still', 'people', 'were', 'actully', 'listen', 'read', 'fairy', 'tales', 'way', 'were', 'meant', 'be', 'listened', 'read', 'storyteller', 'would', 'be', 'accused', 'being', 'sick', 'violent', 'person', 'even', 'society', 'live', 'much', 'more', 'sick', 'violent', '.Jim', 'Henson', 'was', 'not', 'afraid', 'telling', 'story', 'way', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'told', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'told', 'fairy', 'tales', 'right', 'way', 'Such', 'case', 'LABYRINTH.LABYRINTH', 'sort', 'modern', 'day', 'fairy', 'tale', 'Sarah', 'selfish', ""n't"", 'want', 'babysit', 'crying', 'baby', 'brother', 'So', 'goblins', 'take', 'away', 'Did', 'anyone', 'ever', 'tell', 'be', 'careful', 'what', 'wish', 'might', 'come', 'true', 'Well', 'just', 'what', 'here', 'goblins', 'steal', 'Sarah', 'brother', 'Toby', 'take', 'castle', 'goblin', 'city', 'Sarah', 'can', 'save', 'brother', 'only', 'can', 'successfuly', 'navigate', 'labyrinth', 'city', 'short', 'amount', 'time', 'Sarah', 'quest', 'doing', 'so', 'up', 'several', 'loveable', 'frightening', 'confusing', 'creatures', 'have', 'several', 'adventures', 'ultimately', 'lead', 'Sarah', 'confrontation', 'Goblin', 'King.LABYRINTH', 'delightful', 'fairy', 'tale', 'adventure', 'scary', 'monsters', 'fight', 'evil', 'moral', 'lesson', 'Children', 'will', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'However', 'think', 'adults', 'may', 'enjoy', 'even', 'more', 'will', 'understand', 'parrell', 'quot', 'fantasy', 'world', 'quot', 'Sarah', 'perhaps', 'own', 'real', 'life']",N/A

Preschool children will likely find it too scary.",5,aMAZEing,1250208000,"08 14, 2009",2009,394,"['movie', 'delight', 'seeped', 'imagination', 'turn', 'Labyrinth', 'Sarah', 'heroine', ""n't"", 'need', 'karate', 'defeat', 'villains', 'so', 'many', 'young', 'female', 'protagonists', 'today', 'movies', 'do', 'Rather', 'mission', 'courage', 'cleverness', 'friendship', 'great', 'family', 'movie', 'only', 'brief', 'mild', 'language', 'Preschool', 'children', 'will', 'likely', 'find', 'too', 'scary']",N/A

It really is worth watching again and again.The story's opening should appeal to many kids: teenaged Sara rebels at the baby-sitting duties that interfere with her vivid fantasy life. She would never hurt the child, but creates a fairy tale around her frustration. In this story, the beautiful princess (Sara, of course) is set free when denizens of Fairy-land abduct the evil infant. Then, suddenly, the fairy tale becomes real.The story is Sara's quest to recover the lost child from Jared, played by David Bowie. He works well as the world's dark lord, even if his song scenes seemed gratuitous. Sara traverses the mythic Labyrinth guided, misguided, and befriended by beings from Jim Henson's wonderful imagination. This is the true magic of ""Labyrinth,"" the sustained vision, comical and fantastical, of Brian Froud's world peopled by Henson's creatures. The whole world is simply amazing - and it goes on, in changing scenes and amazing detail, for the rest of the movie.This is a wonderful kids' movie, with no real violence or adult themes, and with a happy ending. It does have a dark edge, however, that may scare the very youngest. Although it's a kids' movie, the kids are optional. Feel free to enjoy it just for yourself.//wiredweird",5,Fantasy come to life,1092268800,"08 12, 2004",2004,1338,"['almost', 'gave', 'movie', 'four', 'stars', 'realized', 'how', 'many', 'times', ""'ve"", 'come', 'back', 'really', 'worth', 'watching', 'again', 'again.The', 'story', 'opening', 'should', 'appeal', 'many', 'kids', 'teenaged', 'Sara', 'rebels', 'baby-sitting', 'duties', 'interfere', 'vivid', 'fantasy', 'life', 'would', 'never', 'hurt', 'child', 'fairy', 'tale', 'frustration', 'story', 'beautiful', 'princess', 'Sara', 'course', 'set', 'free', 'when', 'denizens', 'Fairy-land', 'abduct', 'evil', 'infant', 'Then', 'suddenly', 'fairy', 'tale', 'real.The', 'story', 'Sara', 'quest', 'recover', 'lost', 'child', 'Jared', 'played', 'David', 'Bowie', 'well', 'world', 'dark', 'lord', 'even', 'song', 'scenes', 'seemed', 'gratuitous', 'Sara', 'mythic', 'Labyrinth', 'guided', 'misguided', 'befriended', 'beings', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'wonderful', 'imagination', 'true', 'magic', 'Labyrinth', 'sustained', 'vision', 'comical', 'fantastical', 'Brian', 'Froud', 'world', 'peopled', 'Henson', 'creatures', 'whole', 'world', 'simply', 'amazing', 'changing', 'scenes', 'amazing', 'detail', 'rest', 'movie.This', 'wonderful', 'kids', 'movie', 'real', 'violence', 'adult', 'themes', 'happy', 'ending', 'have', 'dark', 'edge', 'however', 'may', 'scare', 'very', 'youngest', 'kids', 'movie', 'kids', 'are', 'optional', 'Feel', 'free', 'enjoy', 'just', 'yourself.//wiredweird']",N/A

Jareth: The power of  voodoo. Goblin: Who do? Jareth: You do. Goblin: Do what? Jareth: Remind me  of the babe.&quot;When I first saw this film as a kid, it was intant  love.  Jim Henson, George Lucas and David Bowie take you into a dazzling  world of fantasy and adventure, &quot;where everything seems possible and  nothing is what it seems.&quot;LABYRINTH, is almost completely  dominated by creations from Jim Henson's Creature Shop, though it does  contains a human or two (David Bowie as Jareth, the Goblin King, and  Jennifer Connelly as our modern-day Alice in Wonderland, Sarah).  Like many  teenagers, Sarah prefers the world of fairytales and make-believe to  reality.  Saddled with the &quot;unfairness&quot; of having to baby-sit her  infant brother, she defiantly wishes that &quot;the goblins would take him  away.&quot;  Little does she know, the Goblin King  really does exist and  he immediately comes to claim his prize.When Sarah tells him it was all a  mistake and she'd like her brother back, he sets her a task: she can get  the child back, but only by finding her way through an endless labyrinth to  the castle in the center within thirteen hours.And the labyrinth is  impressive indeed.  The illusionary world is a wonder to behold, full of  Escher-esque columns and archways, immaculate hedge walls, and a massive  city in the center of the maze surrounding the castle.  Doorways move  about, door knockers provide riddles, and traps ofall shapes and sizes  abound waiting to... well.... trap you.Director Jim Henson balances  the deliberate rhythms with the intricate and impressive special effects of  the time, to create a spellbinding film.  LABYRINTH seems to be inspired  by the works of Maurice Sendak and Louis Carroll as is evident by the  flawless concept design by artist Brian Froud.  Ex Monty Python member  Terry Jones has written a script full of sly wonder and mischievous  marvels.  And David Bowie also performs five mystical, magical songs for  the film.Not many extras on the DVD but there is an excellent  documentary, &quot;Inside the Labyrinth&quot; featuring tons of behind the  scenes footage showing the creation of this incredible looking  film.Bottom Line:  a must for Jim Henson enthusiasts and anyone who  likes intelligent fantasy.",5,A' mazing tale of never-ending fantasy.,966124800,"08 13, 2000",2000,2411,"['quot', 'Jareth', 'remind', 'babe', 'Goblin', 'What', 'babe', 'Jareth', 'babe', 'power', 'Different', 'Goblin', 'What', 'power', 'Jareth', 'power', 'voodoo', 'Goblin', 'Who', 'do', 'Jareth', 'do', 'Goblin', 'Do', 'what', 'Jareth', 'Remind', 'babe.', 'quot', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'film', 'kid', 'was', 'intant', 'love', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'George', 'Lucas', 'David', 'Bowie', 'take', 'dazzling', 'world', 'fantasy', 'adventure', 'quot', 'where', 'everything', 'possible', 'nothing', 'what', 'seems.', 'quot', 'LABYRINTH', 'almost', 'completely', 'dominated', 'creations', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'Creature', 'Shop', 'human', 'two', 'David', 'Bowie', 'Jareth', 'Goblin', 'King', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'modern-day', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'Sarah', 'many', 'teenagers', 'Sarah', 'world', 'fairytales', 'make-believe', 'reality', 'Saddled', 'quot', 'unfairness', 'quot', 'having', 'baby-sit', 'infant', 'brother', 'defiantly', 'quot', 'goblins', 'would', 'take', 'away.', 'quot', 'Little', 'know', 'Goblin', 'King', 'really', 'exist', 'immediately', 'claim', 'prize.When', 'Sarah', 'was', 'mistake', ""'d"", 'like', 'brother', 'back', 'task', 'can', 'get', 'child', 'back', 'only', 'finding', 'way', 'endless', 'labyrinth', 'castle', 'center', 'thirteen', 'labyrinth', 'impressive', 'indeed', 'illusionary', 'world', 'wonder', 'behold', 'full', 'Escher-esque', 'columns', 'archways', 'immaculate', 'hedge', 'walls', 'massive', 'city', 'center', 'maze', 'surrounding', 'castle', 'move', 'about', 'door', 'knockers', 'provide', 'riddles', 'traps', 'ofall', 'shapes', 'abound', 'waiting', 'well', 'trap', 'you.Director', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'deliberate', 'rhythms', 'intricate', 'impressive', 'special', 'effects', 'time', 'create', 'spellbinding', 'film', 'LABYRINTH', 'be', 'inspired', 'works', 'Maurice', 'Sendak', 'Louis', 'Carroll', 'evident', 'flawless', 'concept', 'design', 'artist', 'Brian', 'Froud', 'Ex', 'Monty', 'Python', 'member', 'Terry', 'Jones', 'written', 'script', 'full', 'sly', 'wonder', 'mischievous', 'marvels', 'David', 'Bowie', 'also', 'five', 'mystical', 'magical', 'songs', 'film.Not', 'many', 'extras', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'quot', 'Labyrinth', 'quot', 'featuring', 'tons', 'scenes', 'footage', 'showing', 'creation', 'incredible', 'looking', 'film.Bottom', 'Line', 'must', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'enthusiasts', 'anyone', 'who', 'intelligent', 'fantasy']",N/A

Freeman ""Zach""","[0, 0]","The Labyrinth is one of those childhood classics that you might dread to watch again for fear that the magic that once existed might disappear forever when viewed through the eyes of an adult. Although this is true for many childhood films, it is not so for The Labyrinth.The magical world of Brian Froud, made real through Jim Henson's direction and puppetry remains unchallenged over 20 years later. The inimitable creatures and characters that exist in the world of The Labyrinth; including Sir Didymus, the noble fox, who rides atop his canine steed, Ludo, the sasquatchian rock-caller, Hoggle, the begrudgingly friendly troll, and of course, David Bowie in the equally threatening and charming Goblin King.When Sarah, a young Jennifer Connelly wishes that her baby brother Toby (Toby Froud) be taken away by the Goblin King, she never dreams that it would literally happen. Now she only has a matter of hours to make her way through the labyrinth and reclaim her brother before he will be kept in the Goblin castle forever.The music is amazing, the visuals are unmatched, and the character voices are right on the money.
