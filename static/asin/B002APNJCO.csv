I'm about the same age as Chris Rock, so I can definitely relate to the era.  All the characters are great.  Tichina Arnold (who plays Rochelle) is a stitch, as is the teacher.  How they keep a straight face while saying some of their lines is beyond me.  The stories are so funny, and Chris Rock's narration is the icing on the cake.  Since I hate all the commercials on TV, I ordered the complete DVD set.  It's great, including the extras.  My only complaint is that there is no closed captioning available on the DVDs.  As noisy as my kids can be, I like having the ""words on"" while I'm watching shows.  However, my TV itself has closed captioning, so I use that instead.  I consider this show one of my favorite TV comedies, right up there with Seinfeld and Everybody Loves Raymond.",5,What a hilarious show!,1284681600,"09 17, 2010",2010,907,"['never', 'saw', 'show', 'when', 'was', 'air', 'recently', 'started', 'watching', 'reruns', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'funny', 'was', ""'m"", 'same', 'age', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'can', 'definitely', 'relate', 'era', 'characters', 'are', 'great', 'Tichina', 'Arnold', 'who', 'Rochelle', 'stitch', 'teacher', 'How', 'keep', 'straight', 'face', 'saying', 'lines', 'stories', 'are', 'so', 'funny', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'narration', 'icing', 'cake', 'hate', 'commercials', 'TV', 'ordered', 'complete', 'DVD', 'set', 'great', 'including', 'extras', 'only', 'complaint', 'closed', 'captioning', 'available', 'DVDs', 'As', 'noisy', 'kids', 'can', 'be', 'like', 'having', 'words', ""'m"", 'watching', 'shows', 'However', 'TV', 'closed', 'captioning', 'use', 'instead', 'consider', 'show', 'one', 'favorite', 'TV', 'comedies', 'right', 'up', 'there', 'Seinfeld', 'Everybody', 'Raymond']",Everybody Hates Chris: The Complete Series

We also own I think I love my wife DVD which Chris Rock made. Both are great!We own the whole season for Everybody Hates Chris and we love it! We want our children to see what real T.V. and good T.V. shows really are and because we love this T.V. series, its clean fun and funny! Great for family laughs! We cut the cord on cable and now view TV though our DVD collection or watch though Netflix on our Roku. We just grew tired of paying for paid TV with nothing good to watch.We could not find this show on Netflix and decided to purchase this set as it was more affordable to purchase the set. Which is okay for us as we like to take our DVD's with us while on the road as it makes for some fun times. This has also come in handy when we are out and have to wait for long periods of time.. This happen recently and Everybody Hates Chris Show saved the day! We started season one and before we knew it, it was time to go on to our next destination.So back to the reason we went ahead and purchased this collection. Due to the garbage on T.V. these days, looks like many people are looking for great T.V. shows and are turning to shows like this again. Many people are tired of paying for trash T.V. so they have found other ways to view T.V. the way they want to. Looks like this is the growing attitudes with paid for TV these days.. And I know many like this show so it is in demand!Anyway, our family loves this show and glad that we were still able to find this show for a decent price.. We don't want to spend too much money out of our budget. We are just glad to be able to watch T.V. the way we want to and not have to pay for crap TV. We are tired of today's T.V. shows.. It's really sad that such a good method of influence has turned into trash T.V with the exception of National Geo etc.. Any way, if you want clean T.V. this is it!I can say since we cut cable off we have a better free life.. seems like we have more family time and time to do the things that we want to do. Plus we pay for the shows that we want like The Cosby show since it is not on Netflix. I am glad that this T.V. series is available on Amazon.This T.V. Series teaches a lot of great lessons and also entertains you.. Miss those days of shows like this. So if you are looking for clean great family fun, this show is for you.. You will not be disappointed. Our children love this show!Happy viewing! And if you are looking for more funny shows, don't for get The PJ's with Eddie Murphy, Martin, My wife and Kids, Jamie Foxx, and What's happening! Great shows, real T.V.Shipping was as expected and we are in the process of viewing all the DVD's so we can see how they play!thanks.",5,T.V. with laughs and lessons! what T.V. should be!,1341532800,"07 6, 2012",2012,2796,"['Chris', 'Rock', 'such', 'great', 'talent', 'are', 'so', 'glad', 'are', 'able', 'view', 'talent', 'be', 'entertained', 'clean', 'T.V', 'shows', 'also', 'own', 'think', 'love', 'wife', 'DVD', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'made', 'are', 'great', 'own', 'whole', 'season', 'Everybody', 'Hates', 'Chris', 'love', 'want', 'children', 'see', 'what', 'real', 'T.V', 'good', 'T.V', 'shows', 'really', 'are', 'love', 'T.V', 'series', 'clean', 'fun', 'funny', 'Great', 'family', 'cut', 'cord', 'cable', 'now', 'view', 'TV', 'DVD', 'collection', 'watch', 'Netflix', 'Roku', 'just', 'grew', 'tired', 'paying', 'paid', 'TV', 'nothing', 'good', 'watch.We', 'could', 'not', 'find', 'show', 'Netflix', 'decided', 'purchase', 'set', 'was', 'more', 'affordable', 'purchase', 'set', 'Which', 'okay', 'like', 'take', 'DVD', 'road', 'fun', 'times', 'also', 'come', 'handy', 'when', 'are', 'out', 'have', 'wait', 'long', 'periods', 'time..', 'recently', 'Everybody', 'Hates', 'Chris', 'Show', 'saved', 'day', 'started', 'season', 'one', 'knew', 'was', 'time', 'go', 'next', 'destination.So', 'back', 'reason', 'went', 'ahead', 'purchased', 'collection', 'Due', 'garbage', 'T.V', 'days', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'looking', 'great', 'T.V', 'shows', 'are', 'turning', 'shows', 'again', 'Many', 'people', 'are', 'tired', 'paying', 'trash', 'T.V', 'have', 'found', 'other', 'ways', 'view', 'T.V', 'way', 'want', 'growing', 'attitudes', 'paid', 'TV', 'days..', 'know', 'many', 'show', 'demand', 'Anyway', 'family', 'show', 'glad', 'were', 'still', 'able', 'find', 'show', 'decent', 'price..', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spend', 'too', 'much', 'money', 'budget', 'are', 'just', 'glad', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'T.V', 'way', 'want', 'not', 'have', 'pay', 'crap', 'TV', 'are', 'tired', 'today', 'T.V', 'shows..', 'really', 'sad', 'good', 'method', 'influence', 'turned', 'trash', 'T.V', 'exception', 'National', 'Geo', 'way', 'want', 'clean', 'T.V', 'can', 'say', 'cut', 'cable', 'have', 'better', 'free', 'life..', 'have', 'more', 'family', 'time', 'time', 'do', 'things', 'want', 'do', 'pay', 'shows', 'want', 'Cosby', 'show', 'not', 'Netflix', 'am', 'glad', 'T.V', 'series', 'available', 'Amazon.This', 'T.V', 'Series', 'lot', 'great', 'lessons', 'also', 'you..', 'Miss', 'days', 'shows', 'So', 'are', 'looking', 'clean', 'great', 'family', 'fun', 'show', 'you..', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'children', 'love', 'show', 'Happy', 'viewing', 'are', 'looking', 'more', 'funny', 'shows', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'PJ', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'Martin', 'My', 'wife', 'Kids', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'What', 'happening', 'Great', 'shows', 'real', 'T.V.Shipping', 'was', 'expected', 'are', 'process', 'viewing', 'DVD', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'play', 'thanks']",Everybody Hates Chris: The Complete Series
