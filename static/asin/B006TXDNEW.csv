1519628,ALU0RYT740WDF,B006TXDNEW,Attila The Sub,"[4, 4]","Oh, this is one of those great Joan Crawford movies that you must add to your campy/classic DVD collection.  Originally meant to be a pilot for a television show in the mid 1960's, the producers opted, instead to add to the story a bit and make it a movie of the week.  And what a movie!  If you love Joan in glorious clothes, swathed in furs and dripping in diamonds, you will not regret making this purchase.***SPOILER ALERT***Della, played by Joan Crawford is a pillar of her community who is asked to sell some land in what may have been filmed in the Newport Beach highlands...she demures and asks the attorney (Paul Burke who is handsome and young enough to be Crawford's son, but this doesn't stop Crawford from desiring him in a carnal way) representing the buyers to come visit her at her stately mansion, AT 2 AM!  Turns out she has a beautiful daughter (played by the sublime Diane Baker) and neither one of them goes out in the daylight.  Diane Baker and Paul Burke's characters fall for one another, and it may even be implied that they spent time on the stately grounds of Della's estate in their private observatory, doing more than looking at the stars...as the couple enter at night but don't leave 'til the sun begins to rise.  This was extremely 'racy' for the time.  So Della and her daughter live their lives at night and Della has Paul Burke stay at the estate so he can go over the land~title documents before she decides if she will sell or keep her ocean~front land.  The drama goes on from there.***END OF SPOILERS***The fact that this DVD is available is really a miracle.  I own EVERY Joan Crawford/Bette Davis movie that has ever been made available on DVD.  This is one of those movies I had heard and read about but I doubted that it would ever see the light of day.  As I wrote, snatch it up, pronto, before they are gone.  This is a real keeper and fun to share with your friends who are into melodrama.",5,Stellar Performance By Joan Crawford And A MUST For Crawford Collectors!,1383868800,"11 8, 2013",2013,1936,"['Oh', 'one', 'great', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'movies', 'must', 'add', 'campy/classic', 'DVD', 'collection', 'Originally', 'meant', 'be', 'pilot', 'television', 'show', 'mid', '1960', 'producers', 'opted', 'instead', 'add', 'story', 'bit', 'make', 'movie', 'week', 'what', 'movie', 'love', 'Joan', 'glorious', 'clothes', 'swathed', 'furs', 'dripping', 'diamonds', 'will', 'not', 'regret', 'making', 'purchase', 'ALERT***Della', 'played', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'pillar', 'community', 'who', 'asked', 'sell', 'land', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'filmed', 'Newport', 'Beach', 'attorney', 'Paul', 'Burke', 'who', 'handsome', 'young', 'enough', 'be', 'Crawford', 'son', ""n't"", 'stop', 'Crawford', 'desiring', 'carnal', 'way', 'representing', 'buyers', 'come', 'visit', 'stately', 'mansion', 'AT', '2', 'AM', 'out', 'beautiful', 'daughter', 'played', 'sublime', 'Diane', 'Baker', 'one', 'out', 'daylight', 'Diane', 'Baker', 'Paul', 'Burke', 'characters', 'fall', 'one', 'may', 'even', 'be', 'implied', 'spent', 'time', 'stately', 'grounds', 'Della', 'estate', 'private', 'observatory', 'doing', 'more', 'looking', 'stars', 'couple', 'enter', 'night', 'do', ""n't"", 'leave', 'sun', 'rise', 'was', 'extremely', ""'racy"", 'time', 'Della', 'daughter', 'live', 'lives', 'night', 'Della', 'Paul', 'Burke', 'stay', 'estate', 'can', 'go', 'land~title', 'documents', 'will', 'sell', 'keep', 'ocean~front', 'land', 'drama', '***END', 'SPOILERS***The', 'fact', 'DVD', 'available', 'really', 'miracle', 'own', 'EVERY', 'Joan', 'Crawford/Bette', 'Davis', 'movie', 'ever', 'been', 'made', 'available', 'DVD', 'one', 'movies', 'had', 'heard', 'read', 'doubted', 'would', 'ever', 'see', 'light', 'day', 'wrote', 'snatch', 'up', 'pronto', 'are', 'gone', 'real', 'keeper', 'fun', 'share', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'melodrama']",Della

And this is coming from someone who loves Joan Crawford and Diane Baker.The movie is only about 01:15 in length and it fades to black every fifteen minutes or so, just to let you know that it is a TV movie.The biggest problem is the script. You can't make something out of nothing and this movie has only one plot device which the producers stretch out as long as they can to fill the alloted time. It doesn't work. Even the heavy-handed ""emoting"" by Joan and Diane can't fix a bad script.Paul Burke (Naked City, Valley of the Dolls) is the romantic male lead. He's good looking but he lacks charisma. Wasted in a bit part is Richard Carlson (Creature from the Black Lagoon, The Little Foxes). Also wasted is Charles Bickford (Johnny Belinda) whose hair is styled in a combover that looks more like an upsweep.Crawford is all dolled up in evening gowns, (Odd, because she seldom leaves her mansion). On her one outing in her best outfit, Joan wears a gray chinchilla trimmed suit with a matching chinchilla stole. Her silver hair is styled into an elaborate bouffant hairdo that matches the chinchilla. It's the best outfit she's seen in during this movie. The other stuff looks cheap.Heavy breathing and chewing the cardboard scenery isn't acting. This film belabors the lone plot point until you don't care anymore.Ben Mankewicz of TCM said that Joan and Diane had a falling out during the making of this flick. I wonder what it was about? Does anybody out there know? You will note, however, that Diane's billing comes last, after the rest of the supporting cast, and in a typeface smaller than that of any of the other principals.I rate this film two stars. One each for of Joan Crawford and Diane Baker.Watch it if you must but don't buy it. It will quickly gather dust on your self.",2,DULL-A,1391385600,"02 3, 2014",2014,1861,"['hate', 'rain', 'everyone', 'elses', 'parade', 'thought', 'movie', 'stunk', 'coming', 'someone', 'who', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'Diane', 'Baker.The', 'movie', 'only', 'about', '01:15', 'length', 'black', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'so', 'just', 'let', 'know', 'TV', 'movie.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'script', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'something', 'nothing', 'movie', 'only', 'one', 'plot', 'device', 'producers', 'stretch', 'out', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'fill', 'alloted', 'time', ""n't"", 'work', 'Even', 'heavy-handed', 'emoting', 'Joan', 'Diane', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fix', 'bad', 'script.Paul', 'Burke', 'Naked', 'City', 'Valley', 'Dolls', 'romantic', 'male', 'lead', 'good', 'looking', 'charisma', 'Wasted', 'bit', 'part', 'Richard', 'Carlson', 'Creature', 'Black', 'Lagoon', 'Little', 'Foxes', 'Also', 'wasted', 'Charles', 'Bickford', 'Johnny', 'Belinda', 'hair', 'styled', 'combover', 'more', 'upsweep.Crawford', 'dolled', 'up', 'evening', 'gowns', 'Odd', 'mansion', 'one', 'outing', 'best', 'outfit', 'Joan', 'gray', 'chinchilla', 'trimmed', 'suit', 'matching', 'chinchilla', 'stole', 'silver', 'hair', 'styled', 'elaborate', 'bouffant', 'hairdo', 'chinchilla', 'best', 'outfit', 'seen', 'movie', 'other', 'stuff', 'cheap.Heavy', 'breathing', 'chewing', 'cardboard', 'scenery', ""n't"", 'acting', 'film', 'lone', 'plot', 'point', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'anymore.Ben', 'Mankewicz', 'TCM', 'said', 'Joan', 'Diane', 'had', 'falling', 'out', 'making', 'flick', 'wonder', 'what', 'was', 'about', 'Does', 'anybody', 'there', 'know', 'will', 'note', 'however', 'Diane', 'billing', 'last', 'rest', 'supporting', 'cast', 'typeface', 'smaller', 'other', 'principals.I', 'rate', 'film', 'two', 'stars', 'One', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'Diane', 'Baker.Watch', 'must', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'will', 'quickly', 'gather', 'dust', 'self']",Della
1519630,A22BPC7LRSGSYQ,B006TXDNEW,Joker,"[2, 2]","Just some quick thoughts...Della (1964) stars Joan Crawford, Diane Baker, and Charles Bickford.  This is a soap opera-ish TV movie that I see as sort of a 1960s version of Dynasty.  Crawford looks good and fits her role very well.  However, I don't care for the picture being blurry every time there's a closeup of her.  I find it distracting.  Crawford no doubt requested that the camera lens be ""fogged up"" or ""blurred"" or ""softened"" if you will on her closeups so as to disguise her signs of aging.  One minute the camera is on, say, Diane Baker, and the picture is clear.  Then the next scene the camera cuts back to Joan Crawford and suddenly the picture is sort of blurry.  Then it cuts back to Diane Baker and the picture is clear.  Then it cuts back to Crawford and it's blurry, and so on and so forth.  Not only is it distracting visually, but it's distracting mentally because it makes me think, ""Come on, this was not necessary"" every time the camera cuts back to Joan.  But other than this, I find the movie refreshing and different than Crawford's other work over the previous decades.  This movie is like a time capsule back to the early to mid 60s - it has that feel of the time period.Diane Baker was one busy young woman in 1964 (Marnie, Strait Jacket, Della, etc.).  She looks the same (and great) in all three movies.  My favorite scene with her in Della is the swimming pool scene.Overall, a good movie.  I give this movie 4 1/2 stars, rounded up to 5 stars.",5,Sort of like a 1960s Dynasty,1391385600,"02 3, 2014",2014,1478,"['Just', 'quick', 'thoughts', 'Della', '1964', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'Diane', 'Baker', 'Charles', 'Bickford', 'soap', 'opera-ish', 'TV', 'movie', 'see', 'sort', '1960s', 'version', 'Dynasty', 'Crawford', 'good', 'role', 'very', 'well', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'picture', 'being', 'blurry', 'time', 'closeup', 'find', 'distracting', 'Crawford', 'doubt', 'requested', 'camera', 'be', 'fogged', 'up', 'blurred', 'softened', 'will', 'closeups', 'so', 'disguise', 'signs', 'aging', 'One', 'minute', 'camera', 'say', 'Diane', 'Baker', 'picture', 'clear', 'Then', 'next', 'scene', 'camera', 'back', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'suddenly', 'picture', 'sort', 'blurry', 'Then', 'back', 'Diane', 'Baker', 'picture', 'clear', 'Then', 'back', 'Crawford', 'blurry', 'so', 'so', 'forth', 'Not', 'only', 'distracting', 'visually', 'distracting', 'mentally', 'think', 'Come', 'was', 'not', 'necessary', 'time', 'camera', 'back', 'Joan', 'other', 'find', 'movie', 'refreshing', 'different', 'Crawford', 'other', 'work', 'previous', 'decades', 'movie', 'time', 'capsule', 'back', 'early', 'mid', '60s', 'feel', 'time', 'period.Diane', 'Baker', 'was', 'one', 'busy', 'young', 'woman', '1964', 'Marnie', 'Strait', 'Jacket', 'Della', 'etc.', 'same', 'great', 'three', 'movies', 'favorite', 'scene', 'Della', 'swimming', 'pool', 'scene.Overall', 'good', 'movie', 'give', 'movie', '4', '1/2', 'stars', 'rounded', 'up', '5', 'stars']",Della

Since the early 1950's Crawford had been searching for a television project that would benefit her both professionally and financially as she knew her film career was pretty much over. All that was offered to her by the mid-'60's was horror films, but she wanted to show America she still had the acting ability that made her famous to begin with.In the early part of 1964 Joan starred in a pilot for a prime time soap opera titled &#34;Della&#34;, which would be renamed &#34;Fatal Confinement&#34; when it arrived on video in the late eighties. Crawford plays a rich, manipulative woman who practically owns the entire town she lives in. She harbors secrets, the most of which deals with her daughter, played beautifully by Diane Baker who had starred with Crawford in 1963's &#34;Straight-Jacket&#34; and the 1959 film &#34;Best of Everything&#34;.The pilot had everything going for it: a superb cast with Hollywood's biggest actress in the lead, wonderful writing, exquisite sets, wonderful costumes and the ability to tell stories continually on a weekly basis.Sadly, the pilot was offered to both CBS and ABC who turned the producers down.Also sad was the fact Crawford never did find an appropriate vehicle on TV to star in, so she regulated to showing up in guest parts for the rest of her career in shows like &#34;The Lucy Show&#34;, &#34;The Tim Conway Hour&#34; and &#34;Man from UNCLE&#34;. Her film career was even worse as her last two roles were horror flicks shot in England on budgets so low she had to use her own clothes and get ready in a nearby car that served as her dressing room.",5,"""Before ""Dallas"" and ""Dynasty"" There Was ""Della""",1388620800,"01 2, 2014",2014,1801,"['1964', 'right', 'heels', 'winning', 'performance', '34', 'Happened', 'baby', 'Jane', '34', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'career', 'sky', 'dove', 'was', 'immediately', 'demand', 'actress', 'again', 'Hollywood', 'early', '1950', 'Crawford', 'had', 'been', 'searching', 'television', 'project', 'would', 'benefit', 'professionally', 'financially', 'knew', 'film', 'career', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'was', 'offered', ""mid-'60"", 'was', 'horror', 'films', 'wanted', 'show', 'America', 'still', 'had', 'acting', 'ability', 'made', 'famous', 'begin', 'early', 'part', '1964', 'Joan', 'starred', 'pilot', 'prime', 'time', 'soap', 'opera', 'titled', '34', 'Della', '34', 'would', 'be', 'renamed', '34', 'Fatal', 'Confinement', '34', 'when', 'arrived', 'video', 'late', 'eighties', 'Crawford', 'rich', 'manipulative', 'woman', 'who', 'practically', 'entire', 'town', 'secrets', 'most', 'deals', 'daughter', 'played', 'beautifully', 'Diane', 'Baker', 'who', 'had', 'starred', 'Crawford', '1963', '34', 'Straight-Jacket', '34', '1959', 'film', '34', 'Best', 'Everything', '34', '.The', 'pilot', 'had', 'everything', 'going', 'superb', 'cast', 'Hollywood', 'biggest', 'actress', 'lead', 'wonderful', 'writing', 'exquisite', 'sets', 'wonderful', 'costumes', 'ability', 'tell', 'stories', 'continually', 'weekly', 'basis.Sadly', 'pilot', 'was', 'offered', 'CBS', 'ABC', 'who', 'turned', 'producers', 'down.Also', 'sad', 'was', 'fact', 'Crawford', 'never', 'did', 'find', 'appropriate', 'vehicle', 'TV', 'star', 'regulated', 'showing', 'up', 'guest', 'parts', 'rest', 'career', 'shows', '34', 'Lucy', 'Show', '34', '34', 'Tim', 'Conway', 'Hour', '34', '34', 'Man', 'UNCLE', '34', 'film', 'career', 'was', 'even', 'worse', 'last', 'two', 'roles', 'were', 'horror', 'flicks', 'shot', 'England', 'budgets', 'so', 'low', 'had', 'use', 'own', 'clothes', 'get', 'ready', 'nearby', 'car', 'served', 'dressing', 'room']",Della
1519633,A2QG7X76I4NAMC,B006TXDNEW,"TL ""TL""","[0, 0]","Along with &#8220;The Caretakers&#8221; (a misunderstood and underrated film), &#8220;Night Gallery&#8221; and &#8220;&#8230;Baby Jane,&#8221; this is one of Crawford's finest hours from the 1960s. In a role that calls for her to be tough, tender and highly vulnerable, she&#8217;s riveting; whether calm and authoritative, emotionally fragile or imperiously overbearing, its hard to find fault with her performance.Personally I find Paul Burke to be his usual one-note self and not worthy of much attention, although his performance is usually passable, as it is here. Baker is a bit shrill at times, but still manages to provide a level of pathos in a somewhat two-dimensional role. Although never mentioned on screen, the condition her character suffers from is a rare skin-disease that, in the days before sun-block, would never allow her to in the sun for more than a few minutes. And in fact, those who suffer with severe cases of this condition today are rarely given more a twenty year life expectancy.Charles Bickford is fine in a fairly small role that would have been greatly expanded for the series, and for which Crawford would have returned so as to provide details of their characters romantically tangled past.I'd have loved it if someone were to have laid their hands on the 104 minute version of this made for television pilot, which had it gone on to become the series &#34;Royal Bay,&#34; would have compromised the first two episodes. Over 30 minutes was excised to fit a 90 minute time frame for TV syndication; a number of Crawford scenes were chopped, as well small scenes with Sara Taft as her made and a side story involving Richard Carlson, Robert Sampson & Mariana Case's characters&#8212;even the picnic scene was greatly trimmed as a result.Richard Alan Simmons script is at times melodramatic (like one of his prior Crawford projects, Female on the Beach), but Robert Gist's intelligent direction manages to reign in most of those tendencies.Another latterly under-appreciated Crawford film, and very much misrepresented by fans today, and made fun of by some who are seriously clueless about the skin condition of Baker's character. Despite what some of these &#34;people&#34; may insist, from the time this went into syndication in late 1964 until well into the 1980s, this was a popular and much-appreciated film, with an ending that many remember to this day, even if they haven&#8217;t seen it for decades.",5,Crawford's iridescent talent looms large in film more serious than it may seem.,1405209600,"07 13, 2014",2014,2442,"['8220', 'Caretakers', '8221', 'misunderstood', 'underrated', 'film', '8220', 'Night', 'Gallery', '8221', '8220', '8230', 'Baby', 'Jane', '8221', 'one', 'Crawford', 'finest', 'hours', '1960s', 'role', 'be', 'tough', 'tender', 'highly', 'vulnerable', '8217', 'riveting', 'calm', 'authoritative', 'emotionally', 'fragile', 'imperiously', 'overbearing', 'hard', 'find', 'fault', 'performance.Personally', 'find', 'Paul', 'Burke', 'be', 'usual', 'one-note', 'self', 'not', 'worthy', 'much', 'attention', 'performance', 'usually', 'passable', 'here', 'Baker', 'bit', 'shrill', 'times', 'still', 'provide', 'level', 'pathos', 'somewhat', 'two-dimensional', 'role', 'never', 'mentioned', 'screen', 'condition', 'character', 'suffers', 'rare', 'skin-disease', 'days', 'sun-block', 'would', 'never', 'allow', 'sun', 'more', 'few', 'minutes', 'fact', 'who', 'suffer', 'severe', 'cases', 'condition', 'today', 'are', 'rarely', 'given', 'more', 'twenty', 'year', 'life', 'expectancy.Charles', 'Bickford', 'fine', 'fairly', 'small', 'role', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'greatly', 'expanded', 'series', 'Crawford', 'would', 'have', 'returned', 'so', 'provide', 'details', 'characters', 'romantically', 'tangled', 'past.I', ""'d"", 'have', 'loved', 'someone', 'were', 'have', 'laid', 'hands', '104', 'minute', 'version', 'made', 'television', 'pilot', 'had', 'gone', 'become', 'series', '34', 'Royal', 'Bay', '34', 'would', 'have', 'compromised', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', '30', 'minutes', 'was', 'excised', 'fit', '90', 'minute', 'time', 'frame', 'TV', 'syndication', 'number', 'Crawford', 'scenes', 'were', 'chopped', 'well', 'small', 'scenes', 'Sara', 'Taft', 'made', 'side', 'story', 'involving', 'Richard', 'Carlson', 'Robert', 'Sampson', 'Mariana', 'Case', 'characters', '8212', 'even', 'picnic', 'scene', 'was', 'greatly', 'trimmed', 'result.Richard', 'Alan', 'Simmons', 'script', 'times', 'melodramatic', 'one', 'prior', 'Crawford', 'projects', 'Female', 'Beach', 'Robert', 'Gist', 'intelligent', 'direction', 'manages', 'reign', 'most', 'tendencies.Another', 'latterly', 'under-appreciated', 'Crawford', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'misrepresented', 'fans', 'today', 'made', 'fun', 'who', 'are', 'seriously', 'clueless', 'skin', 'condition', 'Baker', 'character', 'what', '34', 'people', '34', 'may', 'insist', 'time', 'went', 'syndication', 'late', '1964', 'well', '1980s', 'was', 'popular', 'much-appreciated', 'film', 'ending', 'many', 'remember', 'day', 'even', 'haven', '8217', 'seen', 'decades']",Della
