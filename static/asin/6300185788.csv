On second thought, not everybody can have good taste, right? Recently George Lucas has been releasing his old stuff on DVD, so I wonder if he has the guts (or the greed) to release Howard the Dreadful on DVD, I mean, we all know that Lucas is greedy, but one might think that he knows better.Howard the Flop presents the most moronic main character of all time in a movie, the duck is just a pathetic puppet that makes Tom Green look like a genius compared with this retarded duck. This is the movie that makes your eyes feel tired because they keep rolling at all time. This is the movie that slowed down Lea Thompson's career, she remained fairly popular for a while thanks to the Back To The Future sequels, but after those movies, nothing was the same.I guess that the same people that claims that Howard the Abysmal is a good movie, is the same kind of people that enjoys Battlefield Earth, Baby Geniuses, Anaconda, Mac and Me and Manos: The Hands Of Fate, how they enjoy this lackluster movie is beyond me. Howard the Lame is the kind of flick that would make Ed Wood feel proud.After I saw this movie I was ready to throw the tape to the nearest wall and smash it, but instead, I deleted Howard the Joke and taped a few The Simpsons episodes over it. George Lucas I would curse you for this, but I think that you must have enough nightmares that don't let you sleep at night, so I think that you already had your share of shame.",1,"GOOD LORD, WHAT WAS GEORGE LUCAS THINKING?",1095379200,"09 17, 2004",2004,1562,"['could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'many', '4', '5', 'stars', 'reviews', 'are', 'posted', 'pile', 'stinking', 'crap', 'perhaps', 'Armageddon', 'must', 'be', 'second', 'thought', 'not', 'everybody', 'can', 'have', 'good', 'taste', 'right', 'Recently', 'George', 'Lucas', 'been', 'releasing', 'old', 'stuff', 'DVD', 'wonder', 'guts', 'greed', 'release', 'Howard', 'Dreadful', 'DVD', 'mean', 'know', 'Lucas', 'greedy', 'one', 'might', 'think', 'Flop', 'most', 'moronic', 'main', 'character', 'time', 'movie', 'duck', 'just', 'pathetic', 'puppet', 'Tom', 'Green', 'look', 'genius', 'compared', 'retarded', 'duck', 'movie', 'eyes', 'feel', 'tired', 'keep', 'rolling', 'time', 'movie', 'slowed', 'down', 'Lea', 'Thompson', 'career', 'remained', 'fairly', 'popular', 'while', 'thanks', 'Back', 'Future', 'sequels', 'movies', 'nothing', 'was', 'same.I', 'guess', 'same', 'people', 'Howard', 'Abysmal', 'good', 'movie', 'same', 'kind', 'people', 'Battlefield', 'Earth', 'Baby', 'Geniuses', 'Anaconda', 'Mac', 'Me', 'Manos', 'Hands', 'Fate', 'how', 'enjoy', 'lackluster', 'movie', 'Howard', 'Lame', 'kind', 'flick', 'would', 'make', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'feel', 'proud.After', 'saw', 'movie', 'was', 'ready', 'throw', 'tape', 'nearest', 'wall', 'smash', 'instead', 'deleted', 'Howard', 'Joke', 'taped', 'few', 'Simpsons', 'George', 'Lucas', 'would', 'curse', 'think', 'must', 'have', 'enough', 'nightmares', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'sleep', 'night', 'think', 'already', 'had', 'share', 'shame']",Howard the Duck VHS

But let's just say Lea Thompson herself learned to laugh at it and her involvement in it. (Anyone who's ever been a fan of Thompson's ""Caroline In The City"" will recall the opening moments of one of her earliest episodes, if not the first, where her and her boyfriend are playfully wrestling around while talking about what movie to go see. Thompson, very tongue in cheek, repeats ""Let's go see that Duck movie,"" as they jokingly poke at it's badness.) ""Howard the Duck"" at the very least gave the world more Lea Thompson, something I never tire of to this day. After all, it was extremely early in he career and who wouldn't pass up a movie role? For that this movie's worth at least 1 star. But throw any other reasons out the window. It can't even escape criticism for simply being a cheeky 80s movie, because even in that it succeeds in the worst of ways. The story line is a reach as you'd have to expect, but the ""duck out of water (sorry, I had to)"" story line just was a constant spitballing of plays on situations Howard finds himself continually throughout the movie that fails miserably. And the interplay between he and Thompson is weak, uninspired, and frankly too lunar to hope for any heartwarming Lea situations that would at least appeal to her fans.

206150,A1YB29BIDULEYE,6300185788,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[2, 2]","I don't know if this movie would have gotten as much attention as it did if it hadn't been known for being a horrible flop in the 80s. People either find reasons to justify hating it, or they have to stubbornly defend it and convince us that it is really a 5 star masterpiece despite its maligned reputation.Well, I belong to neither camp. I think this is a decent 3 star popcorn chewer that you will enjoy if you don't take it seriously. It's a low budget sci fi film that is meant to entertain us, and it's not meant to be taken seriously.Moving on, by a freak accident, Howard the Duck is transported from his own world to our world where he is first met with resistance and hatred. But he springs into action when he sees Lea Thompson being attacked. (He knows 'Duck Fu.')They develop an uneasy friendship, and it suffers even more when Thompson thinks her 'marginal scientist' friend Phil can help. Howard then has the comical position of looking for a job, and yet another fight before Phil and his friends (including J. Jones) explain that maybe they can help him return home.As our story goes on, we see the nice guy J. Jones gradually turn into a 'Dark Lord.' He is the 'undefined being' from Howard's planet who takes over J. Jones's body. (Like I said, this film was not meant to be taken seriously.)There is a well done scene where we are allowed to cheer for the 'Dark Lord' as he takes care of some annoying and repulsive thugs.The rest of the story seems to revolve around the Dark Lord kidnapping Thompson to help his buddies come to earth, and us wondering if the now reconciled Howard and Phil can save Thompson. (By the way, their rescue vehicle is a slip shot slapped together airplane. That is an airplane in the loosest sense of the word.)In my opinion, the whole movie seems to be an excuse to get to the end musical video. (Kind of a catchy tune I confess.)My advice is (1) Don't expect a masterpiece. (2) Don't take it seriously. (3) Accept that it's a low sci fi 2 hour popcorn chewer. (4) If this isn't a problem for you, just enjoy the film for what it is.I'll conclude by saying, in all honesty, this film may be known as a major flop, but I've seen quite a few films that were much worse.",3,Not As Bad As We Might Expect.,1316217600,"09 17, 2011",2011,2218,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'much', 'attention', 'did', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'known', 'being', 'horrible', 'flop', '80s', 'People', 'find', 'reasons', 'justify', 'hating', 'have', 'stubbornly', 'defend', 'convince', 'really', '5', 'star', 'masterpiece', 'maligned', 'reputation.Well', 'belong', 'camp', 'think', 'decent', '3', 'star', 'popcorn', 'chewer', 'will', 'enjoy', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'seriously', 'low', 'budget', 'sci', 'fi', 'film', 'meant', 'entertain', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously.Moving', 'freak', 'accident', 'Howard', 'Duck', 'transported', 'own', 'world', 'world', 'where', 'first', 'met', 'resistance', 'hatred', 'action', 'when', 'Lea', 'Thompson', 'being', 'attacked', 'Fu', 'develop', 'uneasy', 'friendship', 'even', 'more', 'when', 'Thompson', ""'marginal"", 'scientist', 'friend', 'Phil', 'can', 'help', 'Howard', 'then', 'comical', 'position', 'looking', 'job', 'yet', 'fight', 'Phil', 'friends', 'including', 'J.', 'Jones', 'explain', 'maybe', 'can', 'help', 'return', 'story', 'see', 'nice', 'guy', 'J.', 'Jones', 'gradually', 'turn', ""'Dark"", 'Lord', ""'undefined"", 'being', 'Howard', 'planet', 'who', 'J.', 'Jones', 'body', 'said', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'well', 'done', 'scene', 'where', 'are', 'allowed', 'cheer', ""'Dark"", 'Lord', 'care', 'annoying', 'repulsive', 'thugs.The', 'rest', 'story', 'revolve', 'Dark', 'Lord', 'kidnapping', 'Thompson', 'help', 'buddies', 'come', 'earth', 'wondering', 'now', 'reconciled', 'Howard', 'Phil', 'can', 'save', 'Thompson', 'way', 'rescue', 'vehicle', 'slip', 'shot', 'slapped', 'together', 'airplane', 'airplane', 'loosest', 'sense', 'word', 'opinion', 'whole', 'movie', 'be', 'excuse', 'get', 'end', 'musical', 'video', 'Kind', 'catchy', 'tune', 'confess', 'advice', '1', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'masterpiece', '2', 'Do', ""n't"", 'take', 'seriously', '3', 'low', 'sci', 'fi', '2', 'hour', 'popcorn', 'chewer', '4', ""n't"", 'problem', 'just', 'enjoy', 'film', 'what', ""'ll"", 'conclude', 'saying', 'honesty', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'known', 'major', 'flop', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quite', 'few', 'films', 'were', 'much', 'worse']",Howard the Duck VHS

Good riddance!  George Lucas (executive producer) is lucky that he always has the Star Wars and Indiana Jones franchises to fall back on.One can only imagine what was going through everyone's minds when they decided that ""Howard The Duck"" just had to be brought to the big screen.  This is truly a one joke movie stretched out for an abhorrent 110 minutes.  Howard is a walking and talking duck (of course!) who lives on a planet where ducks have evolved into the predominant species.  He is accidentally zapped by a laser shot off into space by some scientists here on Earth (Don't ask!).  He ends up being sucked off of his home planet and ends up here on our planet.A chance encounter brings him face to face with a struggling musician named Beverly, played by Lea Thompson.  She takes the feathered phenomenon home with her and develops an awkward relationship with him.  Perhaps I don't fully appreciate the innuendos made about bestiality in this movie.  Anyway,  the story soon spirals wildly out of control when the scientists use their laser again.  This time it has zapped a dark overlord (No...I'm not kidding!) to our planet.  Not surprisingly, the overlord isn't interested in sightseeing and getting to know Earth's inhabitants.  Instead, he wants to bring a few of his demon friends down here and extinguish all of the Earthlings.Everything culminates in a rather dull and predictable ending.

Lucas caught a lot of flack on this movie and even he admitted it didn't fare well. Although a copy being made again will make the handful of die hard fans happy, it is doubtful it will sale many copies. This is not to say some movies didn't do well at the theater and then sold very well on DVD. I am happy they are selling it for such a good price to the fans. However, if you haven't seen it before, I highly recommend you rent it first.The humor didn't get many laughs from most during the original release. In fact I mostly heard groans at the theater I saw it at. Great priced quality DVD with several extras and plenty of replayability for Howard fans. By the way I respect the die hard fans of this movie because I know what it is like to love a movie that everyone else thinks is a turkey so please don't give me negative votes because I don't like it.

Howard the Duck is no Saving Private Ryan or English Patient.  Thankfully not all films are or we'd be really bored.  What Howard The Duck IS is entertaining.  It's a guy in a duck suit...so what?  It's pretty funny and refreshingly enjoyable to watch.  It is a well made B-movie...so if you look at it on that level then it's a lot of fun.  And it's not helpful to compare the film which is aimed at a young audience to the comic which was very adult.

It almost seems redundant and tiresome to keep shooting such an already over-satirized target... though this movie took moments off my life I will never have back. I watched it simply to see what all the fuss was about.I understand now...Ughhhhhh....They actually put this movie on DVD? Wow... well...Easy target as it may be, I must now express my contempt and hatred. After the severe deforming scar it left on my psyche, it's the very least of myI actually lost seconds of my life as well, dear children. I actually feel like I'm suffering from motion sickness just THINKING about this movie...Special FX Master George Lucas disowned this film. I know ""Willow"" wasn't great... and neither was ""Radioland Murders"" Or ""Star Wars: Episode II""...But here is a movie... that brings us all together... unifying us... in anger, disgust and hate... and annoyance...Too stupid and lame to be fun and thought-provoking... takes itself too seriously to be campy fun (even by the standards of schlock '50's sci-fi/action movies--now some of THOSE are fun!) But with none of the charm, innocence, sweetness, much grosser, much raunchier... and special FX that even for their time, look cheesy and crummy. They borderline on rolling static.Too poorly filmed and horribly shot and embarrassingly acted to a fun family movie, too awkward and straight-faced to even be unintentionally funny.......and the bestiality thing with Thompson and the duck...well, there's just NO genre for that, now is there?This was not a good day for film. It's like a full-length version of ""ALF....""No, wait... I LIKED ""Alf."" I will not smear his legacy by associating it with this interplanetary bird-flu.The fact that Howard knows a type of martial arts (""Quack Fu,"" as he calls it) is hurtfully unfunny.And this came from Lucas, who's special FX company ILM is the finest on the planet? The effects are phony and ugly and hideous and horribly unconvincing... and that's the last thing we'd ever expect from George Lucas. The special effects look like they're from the '50's, like the very same surving production values from ""Plan 9 From Outer Space."" Including the acting and screenplay. It's like if Jar Jar Binks got his own starring movie... actually, that might have been better.It's ""all too easy"" (to quote the great Darth Vader) to point out what a hideously mismade, tacky as can be blunder. One can go on and on about what a monumental waste of film, time, money and other precious human resources. Hell, look at all the time and effort Lucas' other company, Industrial Light & Magic put into this one. Why didn't they just set it all on fire and dump it all into a cesspool? Would've saved time and cut-out the middle-man.This little piffle was written by Gloria Katz and Willard Huyck, who are no strangers to Lucasfilm projects, having written several Lucas' projects (""American Graffiti,"" ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" and ""Radioland Murders""). They're obviously favorites and friends of Lucas and clearly they wanted to make a special-effects sci-fi extravaganza of their own. And you have to love Lucas for giving them the shot.But it's a disaster. Willard Hyuck has proved to be necessary and crucial script doctor polishing Lucas' stuff so he seems like a superhuman Greek god of film. But every film he's ever directed is not just bad, it becomes renown for being such a low point in cinema history.His ""catastrophes"" include ""Best Defense,"" ""Dead People"" and this steaming pile. (OK, I'll concede ""French Postcards."" Hell, I guess even a broken clock is right twice a day).Kids love taking animal characters, paticularly muppets and the like. Their favorite are the traditional wise-cracking, pratfalling types. Well, I'm sorry to say that Howard lacks humor or charm really of any kind. Honestly, he lacks any kind of interest whatsoever.Does anyone here remember the scene where Jeffrey Jones as the Dark Overlord in the biker bar... the final showdown where the demons may enter through the portal to our dimension... the scene where Howard brawls with the guy managing the group... all had me shaking my head in disbelief...I know most of this goddammed review isn't exactly written in a deep, compelling way. But if the filmmakers didn't put any real interest (or much fun) into this one, how can anyone talking about it? Well, maybe at it's expense. That's the best thing you can do with a bad movie.And for this one, the rolling credits over the musical montage concert at the end... didn't come soon enough.Former accomplished ballerina-turned actress Lea Thompson has recovered from this abomination thankfully. Though I certainly have not.It still haunts me...danessf@yahoo.com[...]",1,Do bad movies go to hell?

206169,A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY,6300185788,"David A. Dein ""passafist""","[4, 7]","Momma always said, ""you learn more from your failures, than you do from your successes.""  I think Momma has a point.  Sometimes failures can point the way to the future.  The 80's were a good barometer for that, and no other movie has blazed the trail of failure quite like Willard Huyck colossal miscalculation HOWARD THE DUCK. A movie that is inept and pointless, and yet so full of innovative and yes even breathtaking special effects.HOWARD THE DUCK tells the story of a duck named Howard (voiced by Chip Zein, and played by a bunch of little people in a duck suit) who lives on a planet much like earth, except Duck's are the top of the food chain.  He's a failed rock musician who's finally given up that dream and has settled into the mundane life of an advertising copywriter.  On one particular day, he's just gets home from another day of the daily grind, when he's sucked into a giant laser beam and transported to Cleveland, Ohio on our earth.  Let the comic hijinks begin...well okay let the less than stellar puns begin.Howard meets Beverly (Lean Thompson) a struggling rock musician and takes up ""roost"" in her apartment.  After a day or so they fall in love.  There's also a young Lab Assistant named Phil (Tim Robbins in a star-making performance) and Dr. Jennings (Jefferey Jones) whom want to help Howard get home, via the giant laser beam that brought him to earth in the first place.I stop there because the second half of the movie has to do with this wild alien and I'm not quite sure I can do that part of the story any real justice.  Suffice to say there's an alien threat and Howard is here to stop it. Actually he kind of runs away from it as the alien menace and the cops try to stop him.HOWARD THE DUCK is based on a far more interesting and inventive comic book series created by Steve Gerber.  This movie and that series have absolutely nothing in common but the name.  In fact the movie ruined the comic book series that poor Steve Gerber sued Universal and George Lucas, and then killed off his Duck for a long time.  How's that for fair.Wait a second you say, go back just a minute, did you just say George Lucas?  Yes ladies and gentlemen.  George Lucas was the executive producer of this film and it shows.  His fingerprint is on everything and more importantly Industrial, Lights, and Magic have designed this film as their audition reel.  They throw everything into the pot, creature effects, stop motion, animation effects, makeup effects, an elaborate chase sequence (that I'm convinced was shot for shot re-created for the freeway chase in the MATRIX RELOADED, well not really but It's nice to speculate.) involving a small personal aircraft, and all of it is breath taking.But why?  Why did ILM and George Lucas waste all that time and energy?  The only thing I can think is that they were doing tests for Lucas's next big project WILLOW.You're probably now asking why doesn't the film work?  The biggest problem is there is absoulty no screenplay.  The first 20 minutes of the film fly by, barely allowing the viewer to breathe.  The characters have time to meet, time to fight, time to get back together, all before the story begins to take shape.  By the time it does it shifts radically into a completely different movie involving giant space creatures.They started out with a promising idea; it's ET in the city.  How does this duck adapt to his surroundings?  That should have been the movie.  But there's no room for special effects that way.  So on comes Act 2, and so many effects shots you shake your head.I was also a little disgusted by the Human/Duck love scene of course you see nothing, but the implied relationship makes even less sense then the rest of the movie and is really there just to make a silly joke anyway.This is the key to why this film fails.  It doesn't set its tone properly.  Every other line is some comic zinger that falls flat because the movie doesn't know whether it's a comedy, or an action picture.  There satire, and drama all thrown out there but it goes nowhere.This effects all the acting as well.  The human characters are robbed of any humanity because the script is so disjointed.  They overreact to everything and poor Tim Robbins is forced to mug for laughs when the audience already knows that there are none.The script by director Huyck and his writing partner Gloria Katz is so bad you forget that these are the people who hit just the right beats in their more successful film AMERICAN GRAFFITTI.The films biggest flaw is that it has no audience.  It a tad bit vulgar for little kids, and if you reach the age of 8 you'll be far smarter than this movie is.  As for adults there is nothing of substance in the movie for people to grab onto.But I guess in the end could HOWARD THE DUCK been a good picture?  Maybe!  There were definitely moments of light in the picture.  Moments that seemed unforced.  I especially loved the early scenes involving Howard and Beverly.  An interesting story could have unfolded.  But the films exciting visuals were more important to the bottom line.  In fact the bulk of the film contains this huge chase scene involving airplanes, cars, 18-Wheelers and lots of destruction. Sure the scene is cool to look at but it's not worth the Journey.Stay away from Howard the Duck.** Out of 5",2,An ILM Late 80's Audition Reel!!,1089072000,"07 6, 2004",2004,5309,"['Momma', 'always',

To list this movies good points would be a task in itself, as its inept script, don't care attitude acting and clich&eacute; plot, it was no surprise that this little light was quickly blown out. A poor excuse at film-making in every angle, but the only problem is that its stupidly addictive to the end.

206175,A1FJ4WAOIDPEF4,6300185788,David J. Brown,"[54, 63]","This is a review for the 2009 American dvd special edition release.This is one of the most well known, whether you've seen it or not, films of all time.  23 Years ago George Lucas was one of the hottest producer/writer/directors in Hollywood thanks to his involvement with the original Star Wars trilogy and Indiana Jones.  Everything he touched turned to gold.  He started his own sound and effects companies that revolutionised the business and the method in which films are made, and he still does that today.  Then came the infamous Howard The Duck.  Even when it was announced some were unsure why Lucas would gravitate to such an offbeat concept(originally an equally offbeat and satirical Marvel comic).  Then, the reports of the budget and reshoots(which thanks to this edition, you find out was due to the limitations of the original Howard puppet) had the skeptics reeling even more.  Every writer would make sure to note the huge budget of the film, as if it was relevant to anyone at all.  I notice some reviewers here on Amazon seem to use how much a film cost to deride it or how much it made to champion it, as if that says anything about the film itself.  Independence Day was and is a terrible film but it made a tons of money when it was released.  The true test of a good film or a film that trancends is time.It's been over twenty years since Howard The Duck graced the silver screen and became one of the biggest and, apparently, most expenssive flops of all time.  Everyone seems to know this movie.  New generations who watched it on cable don't know a damn thing about the film's reviews or status back in the 80's and just take it for what it is: an extremely silly, farcical, goofy, sci-fi,fish out of water comedy, action adventure, horror movie.  I saw this when I was really young and even at that young age I still knew something of what a flop this flick was, that's how hardcore the criticism was.  Hell, there was an episode of Tiny Toon Adventures that had characters on the boxes in a video store coming to life, and one of them used the Howard The Duck video cassette as a bomb to stop an enemy(GET IT?!?!?  HA!HA!)Well, I still dont' get why this film was hated so much.  I kind of get that it wasn't easily stuffed into convenient packaging.  Was it a kids film?  No, not really.  It contains too much sexual humor, and innuendo to be.  Was it a comedy?  Yes, but it had some sincere and scary moments.  Was it for an adult audience?  Sort of.  It was for anyone, but it seemed as though it would only appeal to those who feel like they're on the fringe of the norms in society.  They can relate to its take no prisoners, anything goes approach to filmmaking and storytelling.  That's the ticket.  That's why it's a cult film now.  An acquired taste produced to be a huge hit, but ended up only appealing to a small few.The dvd itself is beautiful.  The transfer is pristine.  Surprisingly, the old-school effects hold up to the digital transfer.  Phill Tippet's stop motion monsters at the end still look cool and the digital clean up doesn't make them look as arcane as one might expect.  I've always thought John Barry's score was great.  It still is.  This film's score is one of the most memorable and creative, but due to the film's reputation it never got the kudos it deserves.  In one scene there's broad comedy and puns, and then a sweet scene between Howard and Lea Thompson, followed by the awkwardness of a romance between a duck and a human, which is all scored appropriately and it works.  There are two new featurettes on the disc.  One is a retrospective doc, running about a half hour, about the making of the film and its development.  We get the whole creative team of writer director Willard Huyck, writer/producer Gloria Katz(the writing team behind American Grafitti and Indiana Jones and the Temple Of Doom), actors Leah Thomson, Ed Gale(Howard), and Jeffrey Jones.  I think it's sooo cool that they all participated in this and weren't afraid to openly say that they liked the film.  There's a second featurette about the reaction to the film, it's reviews and box-office receipts.  This one is fun too and it incorporates all those interview in previous featurette.  Finally, we get the usual trailers and EPK materials from the film's original release.I got this disc for 12 bucks.  If you like or love this film then it's a must.  If you're mildly interested or you love alternative cinema then it's a must as well.  If you are still a hater from back in the day, then why the hell would you be reading this anyway?PS: Rewatching the film yesterday, I really started missing the stop-motion effects that all but disappeared back in the mid 90's.  The effects are so good, detailed, weighty, and other-worldly that I just smiled through the whole end sequence.  Sure, CGI has it's place for a lot of things it does great or brilliantly(Benjamin Button, Gladiator etc.) but when it comes to creature or monsters or aliens does it look any more real in CGI?  I don't know. I always know when I'm looking at something that's fully CGI and I know it's not really there.  I felt the same way about old school effects.  Gollum from the Lord of the Rings trilogy came closest in that regard,but that's about it.  Just something to ponder if you will....",4,"The 80's film that all is required to hate, apparently, but still has a special edition dvd!",1236816000,"03 12, 2009",2009,5311,"['review', '2009',

""Howard the Duck"" certainly isn't worth badmouthing.  Even with such a silly premise (even the director agreed on one of the special features), it does get the job done.  The cast are interesting in their own way.  Howard is pretty competent even if a bit of a jerk. Beverly (Lea Thomspon), while having VERY questionable taste in species love, tries to be supportive in her own way.  I do like Tim Robbins's character, if only because that character is out of his dang mind.  The story is alright, even if certain elements happened by coincidence or are simply disregarded like the cops after the chase sequence, and the special effects have that quality 80s look that I like so much.  If one can accept how mean-spirited and disturbing it can be (and honestly, nothing can be more disturbing than Ferris Buller's Principle dressing up like a pathological Emmett Brown using his tongue on a car lighter to drain electricity), this movie is worth the viewing time.A heed warning for the white-bread families out there: ""Howard the Duck"" isn't rated PG by today's standards.  This is 1980s PG standards, where aPG ratedfilm can have a guy's heart pulled out anda PG ratedfilm can have kids swear and discover corpses.  This film pushed that rating by its tail, even though a PG-13 rating has just been established.  Besides the grotesque monsters and the homicidal nature of humans wanting to maim or detain an anthropomoric mallard, the movie sure went to kinky side.  There's two scenes of humanoid duck nudity, Howard working in a provocative spa resort with a near-topless chick running across the screen, Howard checking up a badunkadunk of a large woman, Beverly finding a condom in Howard's wallet, and lest we forget the infamous bed scene with Beverly and Howard.  Nothing really happens in the latter, but there was plenty of foreplay and the Duck showed how happy he was; forget about wholesome families, that scene would just creep ANYONE up...except for the furries.Oh, George Lucas, you can be pretty insane, sometimes.

And it's nowhere near as bad as its reputation.  In fact, I'm convinced that if Lucas had spent the money to replace the midget-in-a-duck-suit with CGI (or even better, traditional cel) animation, he'd have had a film that was embraced by both animation fans and fans of the cult comic book character with something akin to the reverence given to WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT?  But if you can close your eyes and use the power of imagination to envision Howard as a real (in a manner of speaking) 'toon, the effect is kind of like ROGER RABBIT in reverse -- a 'toon in the mundane world, instead of a human detective in a cartoon world.  Other than that, the plot and characters are actually pretty reminiscent of their comic book roots.  George Lucas has spent millions of dollars ""refurbishing"" STAR WARS with unneccessary CGI effects ""upgrades"", so why not throw some of that cash around where it will actually do some good and digitally erase the midget-in-a-duck-suit and replace it with some good cel animation?  I know there are those who will violently disagree with this concept as either a complete waste of money, or that the man-in-suit low tech approach is what actually gives the film much of its campy charm.

However, Gerber left Howard and Marvel Comics at the end of the decade due to his struggle to gain control of his signature character.Coming in 1986, at a time when Gerber's dispute with Marvel had exploded into a full-blown legal battle (and the comic publisher had practically destroyed Howard with numerous changes in appearance and origin), the Howard the Duck movie was heavly hyped and awarded a huge budget-largely due to the involvement of one George Lucas. What emerged was the worst movie of 1986, and one of the 1980s many candidates for &quot;worst movie ever&quot;. For those ignorant of the original comic book, the reputation is well-earned, with an unlikeable lead and an incredibly stupid plot.

You can sympathize with Howard's character--in one scene, Beverly hides him in a TRASH BAG- ""I just don't want people freaking out all over the place."" Howard-""What about me?  I'm gonna be in therapy for the rest of my life.""  (I love all his smart-aleck remarks.)  Despite this treatment, he comes to love her and when a new alien that really qualifies as a monster kidnaps her, he gets their friend Phil to help him rescue her, despite not having any way to fight other than knowing a bit of ""quack-fu"".

206197,A17E28QEX42YU0,6300185788,"Jason ""Hastaj00""","[4, 7]","...are the regrets of maturity.Many are aware that 'Howard the Duck' is one of more notable cult classics that spawned from the oft-hallucinatorily bizarre decade known as the 80's. In particular, those born within, I'd say, '80 and '83; most are at least familiar with the film (dare I call it that?), and many of the goobers I know --  (un?)thankful enough to be spit out of the particular time period -- saw the film countless times throughout their childhood, entirely unconscious of 'Howard''s absolutely disastrous performance in theatres when it was released, and of the overall regard the film retained -- generally, a complete abomination. Naturally, I'm one of the many with such credentials, and revisiting the film is both an interesting filmic experience, and, expectedly, a dreadfully painful one.I think 'Howard the Duck', if anything, represents a great sort of virtue; the imagination of a young child is admirably forgiving, not to mention having a mind so unclogged by the anxieties of adulthood, that it can take an abysmal piece of celluloid -- in this case 'Howard the Duck' -- and suck out endless amounts of joy from it. Now, I do think without question the one reason 'Howard' is SO prominent a childhood classic, is the simple, surreal idea of a walking, talking, laughably oversized duck thrown onto a planet (universe) of Humans. Even as an adult, the idea is just stupidly amusing, even charming, and I know as a child it was this very premise that set my imagination on fire. And boy, was it oh-so satisfying an experience, every time I viewed it.So at least, viewing it from a more rationally evolved perspective, I can reflect on this dualistic dynamic between two different beings witnessing the same thing. Yet, I can also rip 'Howard' to utter shreds, unwillingly, and for that not a great deal of satisfaction is gotten. What's really surprising, to me, is that the first five minutes or so of 'Howard' is exceptionally done, and no doubt the filmmakers thought this the most important of the bits within the film. I was awesomely surprised at how impressive and, really, epic the intro was; it used to scare me quite a bit as a kid, when Howard horrifically (his screams helped) gets sucked away into another universe and thrown into space, but I simply admired it from a cinematic standpoint this time. John Barry's score, I might add, within this scene as well as the rest of the film, adds a HUGE amount of feeling -- in fact, I'd dare say it is the ONE consistently wonderful element here, and without it, the film would, in its entirety, be sadistically god-awful.Then, the rest of the film proceeds. The directing here is 'so' incompetent, mysteriously so, you just sort of stare at it in disbelief. The dialogue and overall absurdity of it all -- the relationship between Lea Thompson's character and, as she so grossly calls him, ""Ducky"", is almost repugnant, not because of the underlining sexual nature they bravely suggest, but because of the dialogue, characters, and acting. Astonishingly bad; Thompson was great in 'Back to the Future', released only a year earlier, but her performance here is one of the campiest I've ever seen. I think this, as well as many other things witnessed in the film, is evidence of a director who doesn't know what he's doing. Jeffrey Jones is the only commendable one here, and Tim Robbin's early but awful schtick of ham is entertaining, but it stops there. The writing is just so stupid; the jokes literally come at an overwhelming pace, mostly through dialogue, at least every twenty seconds on average, and quite honestly I'd say about five percent of them work. The rest just suck, hard. And so, with most of the fundamental elements that make a movie a movie, being so truly horrible, the stench is nearly unbearable.But still, I'm not to dismiss the entire thing with my current mindset, for there are individual moments that are surprisingly good. The direction  among the action scenes (Jones' monster attacking a mob in a restaurant; the flight scene with Howard and Robbin; the unbelievably awesome special effects of the 'big boss' monster at the end, which are so meticulous and finely crafted, not to mention fluid, scary, and creative, that I can't help but wonder how much of their budget they ate with its creation... it truly, for the time period, is astonishing.) All of these scenes, again underscored with class by the legendary composer John Barry, tickle me still to this day.Yet, it's just bad as a whole. Bad. Sorry. It will always be one of my ""childhood favorites"", but nothing more. If a DVD is ever released -- and I cannot believe, with virtually every movie ever made now available on DVD, a cult classic such as 'Howard', of such acknowledged popularity, isn't; I honestly think that infamous producer George Lucas' association has played a huge role in this fact, him of course, to the point of ego-maniacal delusion, unaware that his three 'Star Wars' films of the past decade are just as bad). Often, I yearn for the dissociative ability of my younger imagination, as it provided such immersion and believability to a dud like 'Howard the Duck', but such a necessity for one's intellect to grow is not devoid of its own awesomeness. Personally, I'll only recommend 'Howard' to two groups of people: children with a good deal of imagination, or a group of friends getting baked and looking for a good, 'it's so bad it's funny' sort of time (which are great in themselves). That's pretty much it.",3,The dreams of youth...,1159920000,"10 4, 2006",2006,5511,"['are', 'regrets', 'maturity.Many', 'are', 'aware', 'Duck', 'one', 'more', 'notable', 'cult', 'classics', 'spawned',

Bryan,"[2, 5]","Lea Thompson from the ""Back to the Future"" movies and ""Caroline in the City"" and Jeffrey Jones, the principal from ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" meet a talking duck named Howard in this movie called, cleverly enough, ""Howard the Duck.""  It's directed by Willard Huyck, who wrote ""American Graffiti,"" ""More American Grafitti,"" ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.""  And this.  I'd like to tell you this was the nadir of his career, that he rebounded and recaptured his former glory.  But I can't.  Instead, he found himself writing ""Radioland Murders"" at which point, his career died completely.  No happy ending for Mr. Huyck, the poor guy.As good as a movie about a talking duck played by a midget in an animatronic puppet suit could be, ""Howard"" has Lea Thompson glammed out as an 80s rocker, lots of special effects, and Tim Robbins as some guy named Blumburtt; as a reward, he got to marry Susan Sarandon right before her looks went south.  The film's concept is also its plot, although at some point, Jeffery Jones becomes monstrously evil and there's a giant laser or some such craziness that Howard has to defeat.Tim Robbins is an interesting case.  He used to be in movies like ""Fraternity Vacation,"" where he played Larry ""Mother"" Tucker with that Evil Ed guy from ""Fright Night.""  Or he'd be in supporting roles as doofuses (doofi?) in things like ""The Sure Thing.""  Or, he'd be on ""Hardcastle and McCormick"" and costar in a tv movie called ""Quarterback Princess"" in the same week.  It was somewhere in this career phase he found himself starring with a hideous duck puppet in a crappy movie that found about a billion ways to insert the word ""duck"" into everyday phrases.  ""No more Mr. Nice Duck!"" Howard screams at one point.  And Robbins, who has since graduated to films like ""Bull Durham,"" ""Bob Roberts,"" ""Hudsucker Proxy,"" and ""The Shawshank Redemption"" just wakes up screaming...Okay, I've tried to tell you as little as possible about the movie itself, because it's as awful as you've heard.  But it probably has some sort of charm for people who enjoy watching atrocities.  Plus, it was made in the 80s, and we all know the 80s are making a comeback.

George Lucas is the one of the most successful independant filmmakers of all time and the studios waited to pounce on something of his that was different enough to make a point. Still, after all this time, especially on YAHOO, critics like to beat up on this movie because they want to say that Lucas did make a bad movie. Even though I don't care for most of his stuff, Lucas has never made a bad film and like Speilburg, he won't. In the featurette, it is explained that they originally wanted to animate it, but Universal Studios had other ideas. Even though they had no choice but to put a man in a very elaborate duck suit, the effects hold up just as good or even better than anything else released at the time.

""I saw it back in the 80s, and it's brilliant."" So when I noticed that 'Howard the Duck' had come out on DVD, I jumped at the chance to buy it for my boyfriend for his birthday. He could hardly wait to see it. His excitement was full-on. So I popped the movie in the DVD player and we sat down to watch it...Soon after that, even before the film was halfway over, his apologies began. ""I'm sorry,"" he said. ""I'm really very sorry. I remember it being better than this. I'm so sorry.""In the storyline of the movie, Howard got sucked into our world from a parallel universe. Simultaneously, I got sucked into watching a very bad movie and losing two hours of my life which I'll never get back.Every character in this movie was an idiotic, clumsy jerk, except maybe for the heroine of the piece, who was gorgeous yet inanely stupid. How the heck is anyone supposed to like a movie when all the characters are just so unlikeable? And the alleged plot defied my sensibilities, too. I just couldn't suspend disbelief and logic enough to believe that the events in the movie could ever have happened. Actually, I also couldn't suspend logic and disbelief enough to believe someone even made this movie, or that everyone involved in the making of it didn't change their name in the credits to 'Allan Smithee' or something, so they wouldn't have to take the blame for their work being so awful.This movie was a total waste of a talented cast and crew, and I think that was the biggest shame of all. I blame the writer, who in a featurette on the DVD showed she was clearly still in denial about the complete trashiness of the movie when she talked about how she believed the movie only failed at the box office because it was ahead of its time, or the timing was wrong, or some such rot. I don't think she realised just how awful this film was, or that the reason why maybe some people are watching it now is for the same reason they watch old Ed Wood movies, because anything that infamously bad is going to arouse interest. Though I have to say, I would MUCH rather have been watching an Ed Wood movie than Howard the Duck. Actually, I would rather have been watching my own spleen being removed. It would have been less nauseating and painful.I wish I had a time machine so I could go back in time and tell myself not to buy or watch this movie. Then again, perhaps I should have realised sooner how awful it would be after my boyfriend did the same thing in recommending the abysmal movie 'Young Doctors In Love' as being a brilliant movie, another faux pas he's still apologising profusely for.

After watching it, and reading some of the reviews, I have to seriously disagree with all the negative reviews on here. Sure, it's in no way a classic, and Lea Thompson has really big hair (the hairstylist should have been shot for crimping her hair!!!), but it's fun, it's slightly out there, and there is no other movie that can compare to this. Perhaps Who Framed Roger Rabbit? but only very slightly.Maybe the reason why this is getting bad reviews, is because reviewers can't get past the idea there is actually a person in that suit. Yes it's not CGI, it's not any fancy technology (even in a film by George Lucas), there is a person in a duck suit. Really!The plot is pretty simple, but you get the impression it's aimed more towards adults, than a nice little film aimed at the kiddies. Howard gets transported to earth, where he meets singer with the Cherry Bomb,  Beverley, who can't believe she's talking to a duck. She takes him to a friend of hers, a scientist, who can't believe he's talking to a duck ... The story goes on. Then we meet Jeffrey Jones, who is responsible for bringing Howard to earth, and then he turns into a Dark Overlord (here's where I find the resemblence with Who Framed Roger Rabbit?)The best part of this movie is definitely the songs. I started rocking out to the song at the end ""Howard The Duck"", which I'm now officially in love with, and need to get on my mp3 player (hint hint hint). Why can't I find it anywhere??? I need it and I needed it yesterday.Lea Thompson is brilliant, right down to her clothing, which is seriously eighties, along with her hair. She's the perfect kooky match to Howard, and even sings!!! I was expecting to see it was dubbed, but she actually sang! The girl can sing.It's amazing watching Howard interact with everything on Earth, and you've got a heart of stone if you don't feel for him. You do get past the idea that it's a guy in a suit, and if you don't laugh at the quiff he gets when he's in bed, you have no sense of humour.To all the reviewers who think this film is bad - yes, you're entitled to your opinion, but did we watch the same film?

206236,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,6300185788,Monty Moonlight,"[1, 1]","In this Lucasfilm flop based on a beloved Marvel Comics character, an anthropomorphic duck from a world of anthropomorphic ducks (imagine a live-action Donald Duck that looks a little TOO real) is accidentally brought to our own Earth by a science experiment gone awry. This duck out of water story plays out as one might expect, assuming you don't avoid films about anthropomorphic animals all-together (sadly, most movie-goers don't seem to have the imagination for the idea; or rather they didn't in '86; Howard probably would have had a much better chance in the '90's, or today with CGI). Howard meets a sweet would-be rocker named Beverly (who seemingly can't get past Howard's plush-toy like exterior, no matter how lude he behaves), and together the two seek scientific help to return him to his home planet. However, things get complicated when the law and the terrifying Dark Overlord become involved.Full of puns and with a premise many folks simply didn't get, ""Howard the Duck"" is often used as a perfect example of a bad movie. Personally, I think this is a big exaggeration. Perhaps it wasn't as satirical as the comic (I have never read it myself), and yes, it's a goofy concept, but the bottom line is that it is just a fun movie with a great cast and a pretty cool anthropomorphic duck! It's very cheesy, definitely. A lot of the lines and characters are just so dumb, but that's part of the fun. The only part I really don't like is when it goes into the airplane chase, which still feels unnecessary to me and just something that draws the movie out (and often loses my attention). I also think the true form of the Dark Overlord that we see later in the film is too beast-like, considering his intelligence level, but it's no big deal. The movie stars such film fan faves as Tim Robbins and Jeffrey Jones (who play the scientists trying to help Howard get home), Chip Zien and Ed Gale combining to bring the fantastically lifelike Howard to life, and of course, Lea Thompson as Howard's human love interest(?), Beverly. Now, I know Lea Thompson has a good-sized fanbase of guys who were kids at the time and fantasized about her to no end. Well, I was a kid at the time too, and I think I can remember that she was a brief, minor crush of mine as well (among many crushes I've had of all sizes), though I am not sure just what film inspired me. ""Space Camp"" maybe? I can't even remember that movie though. I know ""Back to the Future"" probably killed any slight crush I had on her (seeing her as Marty's aged mom), and I didn't see Howard till MANY years later. Anyway, for the Lea fan, this film may be the top one. I find the 80's hair a bit of a turn off, and much of the clothes too, but she does have an underwear scene that almost makes picky ol' me a Lea Thompson crusher again. One of the best scenes in the film, too.Anywho, this is a great DVD for the film, lacking only the presence of George Lucas in the modern interviews and any sort of audio commentary. What it does have are some great current interviews in excellent new featurettes, a collection of fascinating archival featurettes, a pretty funny teaser and the film's trailer, all things that every DVD SHOULD have if possible but many do not. Glad to see so many bonus features for a film so widely panned. It really is better than it is given credit for, even if it is very cheesy. This is a film everyone should try at least once!As for whether or not this film would be better if made today with CGI... possibly, but that doesn't change the fact that physical effects have a charm CGI never will, and only a few films do CGI well enough to pull off starring characters made of the stuff. And, in the end, it's a great script that would/could make a modern Howard the Duck film something well received. This existing version could have used more beefing up in that department.

I thought that TIME would surely improve what I remembered as, well actually I barely had memories of the movie. The reason I did not have vivid memories of this movie is simply because it is rather FORGETABLE. I'm sorry I didn't really enjoy the movie. I like a lot of Tim Robbin's work. Lea Thompson was the delight of the movie. She is very, very sexy, and very, very pretty and so seemingly sweet. She was a delightful young woman back in the 80's. I enjoy her in movies from this time period. Anyway, the problem for me was that Howard, or Mr. Duck was not endearing, barely cute, the voice of Mr. Duck also didn't do much for me. I probably enjoyed the special features, or the RETROSPECT, of Howard The Duck more than the movie. I'm not SORRY that I purchased this DVD. On the level of sentiment I am glad to have a copy of the movie. However, as a fan of quality in films the script seemed to LACK quite a lot. The movie simply isn't FUNNY to me. I think Lea Thompson is quite a beauty. I also greatly appreciate the LABOR and SKILL involved in putting this project together. The idea of a little person in a duck outfit is novel. The idea of a duck person falling in love with a young woman/girl is novel. The idea of a super evil menace coming down in a laser beam though is just a bit too convenient and DUMB. I didn't care for the actor's portayal of the evil VILLIAN. I thought his EVIL ""VOICE"" was just DUMB. For me this movie was just LEANED more to the side of BORING and DUMB as opoossed to ENTERTAINING, FUNNY and SCAREY. I do think, however, that the BAND that Lea was in was quite an ACHIEVEMENT. I think it is really GREAT to KNOW that that is LEA THOMPSON SINGING. And I liked Howard's Guitar Solo. That was pretty GREAT as was the HOWARD the DUCK Song. Now if the rest of the film had only moved along with some sort of comedic or dramatic TENSION. The movie simply doesn't hold together well. There seems to be a problem with the FLOW of the PLOT. I guess MOST of the problem lies in how the characters were never ACTUALLY talking to the DUCK character. Howard's VOICE was OVERDUBBED and it really SHOWS in how the movie PLOT lacks COHESION and dramatic or comedic tension. There is a real lack of PRESENCE in the film.Still, nice try and great to have the movie out on DVD.",3,Howard the LAME Duck.,1261526400,"12 23, 2009",2009,2367,"['bought', 'movie', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'perhaps', 'twenty', 'years', 'thought', 'TIME', 'would', 'surely', 'improve', 'what', 'remembered', 'well', 'actually', 'barely', 'had', 'memories', 'movie', 'reason', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'vivid', 'memories', 'movie', 'simply', 'rather', 'FORGETABLE', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'like', 'lot', 'Tim', 'Robbin', 'work', 'Lea', 'Thompson', 'was', 'delight', 'movie', 'very', 'very', 'sexy', 'very', 'very', 'pretty', 'so', 'seemingly', 'sweet', 'was', 'delightful', 'young', 'woman', 'back', '80', 'enjoy', 'movies', 'time', 'period', 'Anyway', 'problem', 'was', 'Howard', 'Mr', 'Duck', 'was', 'not', 'endearing', 'barely', 'cute', 'voice', 'Mr', 'Duck', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'probably', 'enjoyed', 'special', 'features', 'RETROSPECT', 'Howard', 'Duck', 'more', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'SORRY', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'level', 'sentiment', 'am', 'glad', 'have', 'copy', 'movie', 'However', 'fan', 'quality', 'films', 'script', 'seemed', 'LACK', 'quite', 'lot', 'movie', 'simply', ""n't"", 'FUNNY', 'think', 'Lea', 'Thompson', 'quite', 'beauty', 'also', 'greatly', 'appreciate', 'LABOR', 'SKILL', 'involved', 'putting', 'project', 'together', 'idea', 'little', 'person', 'duck', 'outfit', 'novel', 'idea', 'duck', 'person', 'falling', 'love', 'young', 'woman/girl', 'novel', 'idea', 'super', 'evil', 'menace', 'coming', 'down', 'laser', 'beam', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'convenient', 'DUMB', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'actor', 'portayal', 'evil', 'VILLIAN', 'thought', 'EVIL', 'VOICE', 'was', 'just', 'DUMB', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'LEANED', 'more', 'side', 'BORING', 'DUMB', 'opoossed', 'ENTERTAINING', 'FUNNY', 'SCAREY', 'do', 'think', 'however', 'BAND', 'Lea', 'was', 'was', 'quite', 'ACHIEVEMENT', 'think', 'really', 'GREAT', 'KNOW', 'LEA', 'THOMPSON', 'SINGING', 'liked', 'Howard', 'Guitar', 'Solo', 'was', 'pretty', 'GREAT', 'was', 'HOWARD', 'DUCK', 'Song', 'Now', 'rest', 'film', 'had', 'only', 'moved', 'sort', 'comedic', 'dramatic', 'TENSION', 'movie', 'simply', ""n't"", 'hold', 'together', 'well', 'be', 'problem', 'FLOW', 'PLOT', 'guess', 'MOST', 'problem', 'how', 'characters', 'were', 'never', 'ACTUALLY', 'talking', 'DUCK', 'character', 'Howard', 'VOICE', 'was', 'OVERDUBBED', 'really', 'SHOWS', 'how', 'movie', 'PLOT', 'COHESION', 'dramatic', 'comedic', 'tension', 'real', 'lack', 'PRESENCE', 'film.Still', 'nice', 'try', 'great', 'have', 'movie', 'out', 'DVD']",Howard the Duck VHS

If you ask anyone to name a bad movie from the 1980's, without a shadow of a doubt, most will mention this movie.I really don't understand why this is so.  I've always liked this movie.  I saw it when it was first released in theaters and I'm proud to say that I currently own it on video.  It's one of my favorite science fiction films... even moreso than some of the latest so-caled sci fi &quot;greats&quot;!What's not to like?  The movie is a film adaptation of the 1970's comic book of the same name and it follows the comic's storyline, more or less.  Howard, a duck from a planet populated by ducks instead of humans, crash lands in Cleveland.  He befriends a rock singer (played by Lea Thompson) and her bumbling scientist buddy (played by Tim Robbins in one of his BEST comedic roles!).  Along the way, the trio wind up battling the Dark Overlord of the Universe (who is superbly played by Jeffrey Jones of Beetlejuice).There are special effects galore in this movie but it's the witty banter that made it for me.  The interplay between Howard and the human characters is often hilarious in a dry kind of way.  Of course, there are also a few over the top comedic scenes in this film (like the scenes with Thompson, Jones, and Howard in the Denny's-like restaurant)... and they, too, are quite hilarious.Granted, this movie isn't Star Wars... but it doesn't TRY to be Star Wars.  It's The Little Sci Fi Movie That Could... and it never fails to entertain me... even after almost one hundred viewings!

Calvin Klein commercial impersonation, talking sensuously about the new man in her life, who just so happens to be a duck, que the feather blowing :)Okay, so the extras could have been a bit better, but when you consider the fact that the film was considered a total bomb, and Lucas's bastard hell spawn by most, I'm just delighted that the thing even got released at all.Also of note, is the picture quality, which is quite phenomenal (hey, even DUNE doesn't look this good :) with good colour and a crisp picture, without any sign of film debris (i.e. scratches or dirt).As for the film itself, I always thought that it was given a bum wrap, and upon watching it again, all these years later, I was quite please to find myself really enjoying the spectacle that is, Howard The Duck.It's a guilty pleasure that I think more people will enjoy, with this new DVD release, and that's just, ""Ducky"" by me :)",4,"THE MASTER OF, ""QUACK-FU"" IS FINALY BEING UNLEASHED ON DVD (AN ADVANCED COPY REVIEW)",1235865600,"03 1, 2009",2009,3032,"['first', 'thing', 'struck', 'was', 'DVD', 'cover', 'art', 'fact', 'Howard', 'duck', 'bill', 'was', 'missing', 'ever', 'present', 'cigar', 'Now', 'being', 'Lucas', 'production', 'who', 'know', 'screw', 'film', 'content', 'current', 'political', 'correctness', 'concerning', 'smoking', 'T.V', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'nervous', ""'d"", 'watch', 'film', 'find', 'Howard', 'stogie', 'had', 'been', 'digitally', 'replaced', 'walky-talky', 'revised', 'version', 'film', 'E.T.', 'reference', 'carrot', 'alas', 'fears', 'were', 'not', 'fowl', 'feathered', 'friend', 'been', 'allowed', 'keep', 'smokes', 'reality', 'only', 'really', 'ever', 'see', 'smoke', 'about', 'two', 'scenes', 'first', 'time', 'establishing', 'shot', 'secondly', 'menace', 'bully', '.So', 'meat', 'potatoes', 'DVD', 'extras', ""'m"", 'happy', 'announce', 'are', 'pretty', 'okay', 'extras', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'commentary', 'producer/writer', 'writer/director', 'Lea', 'Tompson', 'Jeffery', 'Jones', 'who', 'look', 'have', 'been', 'recently', 'interviewed', 'DVD', 'music', 'video', 'song', 'Howard', 'Duck', ""'m"", 'sure', 'there', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'done', 'was', 'MTV', 'age', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'hatched', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice.But', 'what', 'do', 'get', 'pretty', 'informative', '26', 'minute', 'retrospective', 'called', 'Look', 'Back', 'Howard', 'Duck', 'Lea', 'Tompson', 'Jeffery', 'Jones', 'guy', 'who', 'wore', 'duck', 'suit', 'writer/producer', 'writer/director', 'team', 'peppered', 'production', 'video', 'stills', 'out.Next', '12', 'minute', 'piece', 'pretty', 'much', 'continuance', 'Look', 'Back', 'Howard', 'Duck', 'called', 'Releasing', 'Duck', 'production', 'info', 'participants', 'feelings', 'film', 'less', 'stellar', 'reception', 'populace', 'general.Next', 'up', 'nice', 'little', 'assortment', 'production', 'features', 'done', 'just', 'making', 'movie', 'called', 'Archival', 'Featurettes', 'almost', '11', 'minutes', 'talks', 'music', 'special', 'effects', 'etc.', 'film.And', 'lastly', 'get', 'two', 'pretty', 'nice', 'Teaser', 'Trailers', 'film', 'one', 'Lea', 'Tompson', 'tricked', 'out', 'Cherry', 'Bomb', 'hair', 'outfit', 'doing', 'best', 'Brooke', 'Shields', 'Calvin', 'Klein', 'commercial', 'impersonation', 'talking', 'sensuously', 'new', 'man', 'life', 'who', 'just', 'so', 'be', 'duck', 'que', 'feather', 'blowing', 'Okay', 'extras', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'better', 'when', 'consider', 'fact', 'film', 'was', 'considered', 'total', 'bomb', 'Lucas', 'bastard', 'hell', 'spawn', 'most', ""'m"", 'just', 'delighted', 'thing', 'even', 'got', 'released', 'all.Also', 'note', 'picture', 'quality', 'quite', 'phenomenal', 'hey', 'even', 'DUNE', ""n't"", 'look', 'good', 'good', 'colour', 'crisp', 'picture', 'sign', 'film', 'debris', 'i.e', 'scratches', 'dirt', '.As', 'film', 'always', 'thought', 'was', 'given', 'bum', 'wrap', 'watching', 'again', 'years', 'later', 'was', 'quite', 'please', 'find', 'really', 'enjoying', 'spectacle', 'Howard', 'Duck.It', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'think', 'more', 'people', 'will', 'enjoy', 'new', 'DVD', 'release', 'just', 'Ducky']",Howard the Duck VHS

Everybody in our neighborhood talked about it and we couldn't wait until the sequel came out. We thought it was such a cool movie; I mean it had everything that every other movie we liked had (great sfx, cool monsters, a witty hero, car chase) plus it had a little bit of nudity (the female duck in the tub and the woman at the spa) and that made it even more cool. Little did we know that the movie tanked at the box office and sent George Lucas into hiding for awhile.Watching the film fifteen years later, I now understand why it failed. The movie tried to be a cool cartoony type 80's flick, but made for adults instead of kids. Boy, did they ever get it wrong. Everything good about the film appeals to the child in everyone (alien from outer space, good guy verses bad guy, goofy sidekick, car chase, etc.). On the other hand, everything that made the movie tank (the interspecies sexual innuendo, the people making out at the &#34;spa&#34;, &#34;PlayDuck&#34;, etc.) was the stuff that was supposed to appeal to the adult crowd. Now, had HOWARD's filmmakers focused on just appealing to kids, the movie would have been a lot better and would have probably gotten a bigger box office draw and would be more fondly remembered. Instead, it's thought of as one of the worst films of the 1980s, which is a shame because there was so much that could have been done to make this at least a decent movie.

I highly recommend this movie to Sci-fi'ers and comedy fanatics alike.",5,Good clean fun,1084233600,"05 11, 2004",2004,326,"['Possibly', 'one', 'funniest', 'most', 'entertaining', 'movies', 'time', 'loved', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'MANY', 'years', 'ago', 'are', 'foul', 'small', 'pun', 'words', 'sexually', 'suggestive', 'scene', 'are', 'done', 'only', 'comedy', 'mind', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', ""Sci-fi'ers"", 'comedy', 'fanatics', 'alike']",Howard the Duck VHS

Really wish they had this movie in blu-ray format, but seeing it on dvd is amazing in itself. Having grown up in the 80's, I remember watching this alot as a child. My parents absolutely hated it, and still do 'till this day (both were less than enthused when I procured this treasure that I had found on amazon). Regardless of how &#34;bad&#34; this movie is, it still reminds me alot of my youth, which makes it more than worth it. Only thing that could have made this movie better would have been seeing it on blu-ray. If you grew up in the 80's, you won't be disappointed with this movie. Priced well, shipped very fast.
