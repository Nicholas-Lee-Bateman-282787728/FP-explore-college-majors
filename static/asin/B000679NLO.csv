This was clearly a reunion concert as the opening song appropo to the ambiance, ""Old Friends"". The two have known each other since sixth grade.  And we were privy to some of their disagreements that finally culminated into a breakup.Aah, the voices!Art Garfunkel, although he has no rhythm, has a most beautiful voice, better than he ever sounded before.  It was mesmerizing to hear him sing ""Kathy' Song""  And of course, he owns ""Bridge Over Troubled Waters"".  There is something unique in Paul Simons's voice that I always favor, but at times his singing wasn't as strong.Fantastic musicians with an array of instrumentsCredit has to go to this amazing group of musicians who at times played some strange instruments.  Memorable was a unique contraption that produced the most beautiful wailing sound during ""The Boxer"".Note: With help from a reader, I am told the unique contraption was a theremin, one of the earliest fully electronic musical instrument.Musical interpretationsWhat was refreshing about this concert was the choice of musical styles for some songs.  There was enough of a style for the audience/viewers to be comfortable singing along.  But for the most part many of the tunes were just like we treasured them.Everly Brothers..WOW!Simon and Garfunkel paid tribute to their influences, the Everly Brothers and the highlight was to share the stage with idols for ""Bye Bye Love"".  It was a short set, but worth it.  On Simon & Garfunkels early CD, they do a rendition of ""Bye Bye Love"" that is just awesome!Song I didn't hearWith the usual array of classics, and some I had not heard, the song I would have loved to hear was ""Late in the Evening"".  All in all, this concert and production was fabulous.....Rizzo",5,They gave us another great reunion!,1129507200,"10 17, 2005",2005,1844,"['Simon', 'Garfunkel', 'seemed', 'little', 'uncomfortable', 'together', 'were', 'generous', 'compliments', 'other', 'was', 'clearly', 'reunion', 'concert', 'opening', 'song', 'appropo', 'ambiance', 'Old', 'Friends', 'two', 'have', 'known', 'other', 'sixth', 'grade', 'were', 'privy', 'disagreements', 'finally', 'culminated', 'breakup.Aah', 'voices', 'Art', 'Garfunkel', 'rhythm', 'most', 'beautiful', 'voice', 'better', 'ever', 'sounded', 'was', 'mesmerizing', 'hear', 'sing', 'Kathy', 'Song', 'course', 'Bridge', 'Over', 'Troubled', 'Waters', 'something', 'unique', 'Paul', 'Simons', 'voice', 'always', 'favor', 'times', 'singing', 'was', ""n't"", 'strong.Fantastic', 'musicians', 'array', 'instrumentsCredit', 'go', 'amazing', 'group', 'musicians', 'who', 'times', 'played', 'strange', 'instruments', 'Memorable', 'was', 'unique', 'contraption', 'produced', 'most', 'beautiful', 'wailing', 'sound', 'Boxer', '.Note', 'help', 'reader', 'am', 'told', 'unique', 'contraption', 'was', 'theremin', 'one', 'earliest', 'fully', 'electronic', 'musical', 'instrument.Musical', 'interpretationsWhat', 'was', 'refreshing', 'concert', 'was', 'choice', 'musical', 'styles', 'songs', 'was', 'enough', 'style', 'audience/viewers', 'be', 'comfortable', 'singing', 'along', 'most', 'part', 'many', 'tunes', 'were', 'just', 'treasured', 'them.Everly', 'Brothers..WOW', 'Simon', 'Garfunkel', 'paid', 'tribute', 'influences', 'Everly', 'Brothers', 'highlight', 'was', 'share', 'stage', 'idols', 'Bye', 'Bye', 'Love', 'was', 'short', 'set', 'Simon', 'Garfunkels', 'early', 'CD', 'do', 'rendition', 'Bye', 'Bye', 'Love', 'just', 'awesome', 'Song', 'did', ""n't"", 'hearWith', 'usual', 'array', 'classics', 'had', 'not', 'heard', 'song', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'hear', 'was', 'Late', 'Evening', 'concert', 'production', 'was', 'fabulous', '..Rizzo']",Simon & Garfunkel: Old Friends - Live on Stage
862118,A1534MBU6VJXYN,B000679NLO,"Anthony Nasti ""Tony""","[10, 11]","Simon & Garfunkel doing a reunion tour was the last thing on most people's minds in late 2003, but sure enough, it happened. Artie and Paul, the poet and the one band, grabbed their guitars and headed back to the stage for the first time since their legendary Central Park concert in the early 1980s'. This turned out to be a once in a lifetime experience for many young fans, as this will probably be the last time the two ever share the stage again.This dvd, ""Old Friends, Live On Stage"" was recorded in New York in late 2003. It truly is a great show. From the opening song, the wonderful, haunting ""Old Friends/Bookends"", you know you're in for a treat. As Simon & Garfunkel's music is low key and mellow, don't expect some flashy light shows and Vegas style arrangement. The environment is very relaxed and laid back. The performances are great, the standouts being ""America"", ""Bye Bye Love"" (done with the Everly Brothers), ""Scarborough Fair"", ""Mrs. Robinson"", ""My Little Town"", ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" and ""The 59th Bridge Song (Feelin' Groovy). They also dust off some old gems like ""Kathy's Song"" and ""Leaves That Are Green"" which haven't been heard in years.Paul & Art are in fine form vocally, they still have beautiful harmonies. As one reviewer pointed out, they seem a little uncomfortable, but you could hardly tell. They compliment each other like nothing ever happened between them. This a great dvd to have in your collection and I recommend getting the cd as well.",5,"""...And What A Time It Was...""",1135814400,"12 29, 2005",2005,1488,"['Simon', 'Garfunkel', 'doing', 'reunion', 'tour', 'was', 'last', 'thing', 'most', 'people', 'minds', 'late', '2003', 'sure', 'enough', 'happened', 'Artie', 'Paul', 'poet', 'one', 'band', 'grabbed', 'guitars', 'headed', 'back', 'stage', 'first', 'time', 'legendary', 'Central', 'Park', 'concert', 'early', '1980s', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'once', 'lifetime', 'experience', 'many', 'young', 'fans', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'last', 'time', 'two', 'ever', 'share', 'stage', 'again.This', 'dvd', 'Old', 'Friends', 'Live', 'Stage', 'was', 'recorded', 'New', 'York', 'late', '2003', 'truly', 'great', 'show', 'opening', 'song', 'wonderful', 'haunting', 'Old', 'Friends/Bookends', 'know', ""'re"", 'treat', 'Simon', 'Garfunkel', 'music', 'low', 'key', 'mellow', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'flashy', 'light', 'shows', 'Vegas', 'style', 'arrangement', 'environment', 'very', 'relaxed', 'laid', 'back', 'performances', 'are', 'great', 'standouts', 'being', 'America', 'Bye', 'Bye', 'Love', 'done', 'Everly', 'Brothers', 'Scarborough', 'Fair', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'Little', 'Town', 'Bridge', 'Over', 'Troubled', 'Water', '59th', 'Bridge', 'Song', 'Feelin', 'Groovy', 'also', 'dust', 'off', 'old', 'gems', 'Kathy', 'Song', 'Are', 'Green', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'heard', 'years.Paul', 'Art', 'are', 'fine', 'form', 'vocally', 'still', 'have', 'beautiful', 'harmonies', 'one', 'reviewer', 'pointed', 'out', 'seem', 'little', 'uncomfortable', 'could', 'hardly', 'tell', 'compliment', 'other', 'nothing', 'ever', 'happened', 'great', 'dvd', 'have', 'collection', 'recommend', 'getting', 'cd', 'as', 'well']",Simon & Garfunkel: Old Friends - Live on Stage

862120,A36CHPMHHD1IO5,B000679NLO,dvdtrkr,"[5, 6]","I like it better than the Central Park concert, but I also like it better when it's been the 2 of them and just a guitar and would've loved to have seen them do a VH1 ""Storytellers"" together or the types of shows The Eagles, Steely Dan and Fleetwood Mac put out a while back for home video...The songs sound great, and include a lot of songs that weren't included on the ""Central Park"" concert (that seemed to have more solo material than it should have) which makes this truly worthwhile. It's also great to see them with the Everly Brothers...I'd pick up the CD/DVD combo pack, but if I had to choose between just the video and CD, I'd pick the video. There are slight differences between both (the DVD has a few songs not on the CD, and the CD has ""Citizen of the Planet"", not on the DVD).Most of the songs have held up well over the years, even if their voices aren't what they once were, it still sounds like people got their money's worth nonetheless just from the harmonies alone. But it was definitely geared towards the baby boomers more than their kids (and grandkids... must be weird for a 60-something to be singing a song like ""Feelin' Groovy""), but I can't see why all generations wouldn't enjoy it.I do hope that they can put out more of the 60s era footage though, as they did do a TV special around 1969 (parts of which are on the DVD, they should've put the whole thing on!) and made TV appearances a lot around that time.But do check out ""Live in New York 1967"" released 2 years ago on CD and the long lost ""Paul Simon Songbook"" which Paul released (more like caved in) not too long ago. Hopefully there will be more archive releases.Maybe we'll see them together again, but if not, this is a great farewell to a duo who put out some great music in a short period of time that is still being enjoyed 40 years later.",4,"It's good, but they should do an acoustic soundstage show..",1106092800,"01 19, 2005",2005,1834,"['like', 'better', 'Central', 'Park', 'concert', 'also', 'better', 'when', 'been', '2', 'just', 'guitar', 'would', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'have', 'seen', 'do', 'VH1', 'Storytellers', 'together', 'types', 'shows', 'Eagles', 'Steely', 'Dan', 'Fleetwood', 'Mac', 'put', 'out', 'while', 'back', 'home', 'video', 'songs', 'sound', 'great', 'include', 'lot', 'songs', 'were', ""n't"", 'included', 'Central', 'Park', 'concert', 'seemed', 'have', 'more', 'solo', 'material', 'should', 'have', 'truly', 'worthwhile', 'also', 'great', 'see', 'Everly', 'Brothers', ""'d"", 'pick', 'up', 'CD/DVD', 'combo', 'pack', 'had', 'choose', 'just', 'video', 'CD', ""'d"", 'pick', 'video', 'are', 'slight', 'differences', 'DVD', 'few', 'songs', 'not', 'CD', 'CD', 'Citizen', 'Planet', 'not', 'DVD', '.Most', 'songs', 'have', 'held', 'up', 'well', 'years', 'even', 'voices', 'are', ""n't"", 'what', 'once', 'were', 'still', 'people', 'got', 'money', 'worth', 'nonetheless', 'just', 'harmonies', 'alone', 'was', 'definitely', 'geared', 'baby', 'more', 'kids', 'grandkids', 'must', 'be', 'weird', '60-something', 'be', 'singing', 'song', 'Feelin', 'Groovy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'generations', 'would', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'it.I', 'do', 'hope', 'can', 'put', 'out', 'more', '60s', 'era', 'footage', 'though', 'did', 'do', 'TV', 'special', '1969', 'parts', 'are', 'DVD', 'should', ""'ve"", 'put', 'whole', 'thing', 'made', 'TV', 'lot', 'time.But', 'do', 'check', 'Live', 'New', 'York', '1967', 'released', '2', 'years', 'ago', 'CD', 'long', 'lost', 'Paul', 'Simon', 'Songbook', 'Paul', 'released', 'more', 'caved', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'ago', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'archive', 'releases.Maybe', ""'ll"", 'see', 'together', 'again', 'not', 'great', 'farewell', 'duo', 'who', 'put', 'out', 'great', 'music', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'still', 'being', 'enjoyed', '40', 'years', 'later']",Simon & Garfunkel: Old Friends - Live on Stage

862122,A2OM1KMB1OHK,B000679NLO,Gerald Heffner,"[60, 63]","I'll admit I wasn't around during the 60's. I wasn't here for the 70's either and Regan was just finishing up when I was born. That doesn't mean I can't appreciate good music when I hear, and in this case, see it as well. My tastes range from Bebop to Blues, Rock to Reggae, and pretty much all points in between.I've held Paul Simon in the highest regard with the other musical geniuses of our time (Pete Townshend, Brian Wilson, Lennon & McCartney, etc.) but only recently has the duo attracted my serious interest.I bought the ""Concert in Central Park"" on a whim after seeing a short clip on a forum I frequent and was enthralled with the tight production and high, though sometimes awkward, energy. True to my nature as a musical ""guru"" I set out to research all I could about the duo, learning of their beginning, the breakups, the animosity and so forth. By Central Park it seems much of the past was beginning to be just that, the past, and the future was starting to matter again.By the time this concert rolls around the two have aged a good twenty years and have had that time to reconcile. I'm reminded of The Who in this regard, as only Townshend and Daltrey are left and share a similar history. Two old men and a guitar. Once the music starts flowing all personal problems and grudges seem to disappear. Indeed, Paul and Artie (as they refer to each other throughout the night) seem closer than they have been since arguably their first meeting in the 6th grade play, a story which they elaborate on rather humorously.There are smiles in quanitity as well as a few sideways glances between the two old friends throughout the show and I tend to think the only uneasy vibes they put off come from the fact that they haven't PERFORMED together in quite some time. That's a rather different angle than not having TALKED to, or SEEN each other in that span of time. I hardly believe the last time they spoke was at the Grammys, or the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, whichever came first.But anyway, the concert itself is spectacular covering an array of classics as well as some lesser known material for good measure and a few Simon-Solo tunes that ""would've made a good Simon and Garfunkel record"" in his own words. Paul himself is in fine form, gesticulating wildly when not playing his array of guitars and grooving with the beat all night. Artie seems beside himself for most of the show, clearly enjoying it more than any man should have a right to.Standout performances (which are difficult to nail down in such a superb set) include ""I Am a Rock"" with a slightly slower tempo and different arrangement but nonetheless enjoyable. The beginning of the song is a little shaky, but tightens up at the second verse. ""Kathy's Song"" allows Art to shine vocally. The Everly Brothers even show up for a short set, recognized as the models for Simon and Garfunkel. The four share the stage for a rousing ""Bye Bye Love.""""Homeward Bound"" recieves a wonderful treatment with a bit of an extended middle section allowing the members of the supporting band to solo. The band is comprised of some of the best musicians in the industry though nearly every camera shot of drummer Jim Kletner showed a completely blank face, almost disinterested face though his drumming was superb.The second act opens with a montage of footage from various sources including Art's acting career and ""The Graduate,"" leading into ""Mrs. Robinson"" and a jazzy, perfect take on ""Slip Slidin' Away."" A few lesser-played numbers follow including a bouncy ""Keep the Customer Satisfied."" ""American Tune"" sets a new standard in concert performance.It's difficult to tell where the concert ends, as it is comprised of two separate dates. (You can tell which concert you're at by Art's trademark vest, or lack thereof.) ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" seems to be the closer, and a hell of a closer at that. This is where I see the dissolvement of the duo's problems as they share a song that was traditionally Artie's. Though, Paul looks like he's trying to upstage Art with his solo second verse.My greatest impression with this concert is how the two seem to age BACKWARDS as the night progresses. The show opens with two old men, thinning hair, wrinkles, and straining voices. By the time we reach ""Cecilia"" we're back in Central Park. It's a testament to the timelessness of the music that its originators can still capture, and even improve on the connection it makes, thirty, even forty years after the fact. ""Leaves that are Green"" sees a stage revival for the first time since the 60's and the show ends with the anthemic ""Feelin' Groovy"" featuring some ... odd instrumentation.If the two men were at odds, or at the very least unconversational with each other we might have ended up with something akin to the Roth/Hagar Van Halen concerts of a few years back, in spirit anyway. It shows through the music on stage and the ambient, laid back atmosphere of the entire show that they still are, as the title implies ""Old Friends."" I see no reason why this DVD should be viewed as a farewell, or a swan song. With talks of a new studio project or more touring, the sky's the limit for these icons in the new milennium.As long as Paul Simon can write songs and Art Garfunkel can sing they'll be our bridge over troubled waters.",5,Old Friends ensnare a New Fan,1141084800,"02 28, 2006",2006,5296,"[""'ll"", 'admit', 'was', ""n't"", 'around', '60', 'was', ""n't"", 'here', '70', 'Regan', 'was', 'just',

862125,A1WJHYYK667JC1,B000679NLO,Karen S,"[0, 0]","My husband and I saw this concert when Simon and Garfunkel were in Grand Rapids (Michigan) at Van Andel arena.  I left there so excited, I've always loved these two but that concert was the best.  They sang so well and seemed happy to be there.  They actually interacted with the audience.  I wish that was the actual concert that was filmed.  The singing is still wonderful on this DVD, but there is none of the interacting with the viewers.

For me, they were the only ones who equaled The Beatles in quality (if not quantity) of brilliant songs. I was hoping for a recording in a more intimate setting befitting their music. From the moment I heard the rowdy audience reception for ""Old friends,"" I knew this wasn't to be. It's Simon and Garfunkle, people, not ACDC! One reviewer claimed this DVD is better than the ""Central Park"" concert, but I disagree. I don't know if it was editing and production or a more respectful audience, but the ""Central Park"" concert seems vastly more intimate and satisfying. Don't get me wrong, if you're a fan you should purchase this DVD. S&G perform brilliantly, and it's a joy for this old timer to see them again 40 years later.

Martin,"[2, 2]","I saw the Central Park concert on PBS in the late eighties or early nineties (how time flies), but of coure I had heard their music for years on the radio, before they stopped playing anything older than 5 minutes (it seems). This DVD was excellent from a technical point of view, and it was certainly more enjoyable to watch as they were actually speaking to each other.  Their voices have deteriorated slightly with age, but they still put forth a remarkable show, and it was a refreshing change to see them show their idols and inspiration, the Everly Bros, the respect they felt they clearly deserved.  I feel the vocal quality of the Central Park concert is better for obvious reasons, but this is a good show nonetheless.

His lyrics are known around the world and many of his songs are already classics.Simon and Garfunkel still have chemistry or a magic if you will.After breaking up 35 years ago, they are still popular enough to sell out large basketball arenas with fans.Many of their best songs appear on this DVD. Before I viewed this DVD I thought maybe it would be a lot like the Central Park Concert they did in the early 80's.This concert shows Simon & Garfunkel as the icons they were and still are. You hear them do Old Friends/Bookends, I am a Rock which has a slightly different arrangement, At the Zoo, America and an outstanding version of Kathy's Song.They do a short set of songs with the Everly Brothers.They go into Scarborough Fair, Homeward Bound and Sounds of Silence and several other songs by Paul Simon and Simon and Garfunkel.An American Tune is one of the outstanding songs of the night, along with Bridge over troubled Water.They end the concert with The Boxer and do Leaves that are green as an encore.When I watch this I just cant help but to feel what a shame it is that they broke up so early.You also find yourself wondering why they never recorded again after the break up.This is an outstanding concert by two of the greatest singers in American history......................sit back and enjoy",4,Old Friends playing old songs,1133222400,"11 29, 2005",2005,1453,"['Simon', 'Garfunkel', '60', 'were', 'one', 'top', 'acts', 'America.Paul', 'Simon', 'one', 'great', 'writers', 'history', 'American', 'folk', 'music', 'lyrics', 'are', 'known', 'world', 'many', 'songs', 'are', 'already', 'classics.Simon', 'Garfunkel', 'still', 'have', 'chemistry', 'magic', 'will.After', 'breaking', 'up', '35', 'years', 'ago', 'are', 'still', 'popular', 'enough', 'sell', 'out', 'large', 'basketball', 'arenas', 'fans.Many', 'best', 'songs', 'appear', 'DVD', 'viewed', 'DVD', 'thought', 'maybe', 'would', 'be', 'lot', 'Central', 'Park', 'Concert', 'did', 'early', ""80's.This"", 'concert', 'shows', 'Simon', 'Garfunkel', 'icons', 'were', 'still', 'are', 'hear', 'do', 'Old', 'Friends/Bookends', 'am', 'Rock', 'slightly', 'different', 'arrangement', 'Zoo', 'America', 'outstanding', 'version', 'Kathy', 'Song.They', 'do', 'short', 'set', 'songs', 'Everly', 'Brothers.They', 'go', 'Scarborough', 'Fair', 'Homeward', 'Bound', 'Sounds', 'Silence', 'several', 'other', 'songs', 'Paul', 'Simon', 'Simon', 'Garfunkel.An', 'American', 'Tune', 'one', 'outstanding', 'songs', 'night', 'Bridge', 'troubled', 'Water.They', 'end', 'concert', 'Boxer', 'do', 'Leaves', 'are', 'green', 'encore.When', 'watch', 'just', 'cant', 'help', 'feel', 'what', 'shame', 'broke', 'up', 'so', 'early.You', 'also', 'find', 'wondering', 'why', 'never', 'recorded', 'again', 'break', 'up.This', 'outstanding', 'concert', 'two', 'greatest', 'singers', 'American', 'history', '.sit', 'back', 'enjoy']",Simon & Garfunkel: Old Friends - Live on Stage

I also wish American Tune was recorded by both back then, it would have been another great hit like ""Bridge"" which still gives me goosebumps.They have spoken and visited each other over the years, not performed, but I felt they were very comfortable and if you watched inteviews, although some spats were fierce, the love and affection they have for each other is always there.
