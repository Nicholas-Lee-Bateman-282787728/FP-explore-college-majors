I'm guessing that these actors studied the original to stay true to the script. Jack Lemmon was outstanding, but I kept thinking of Fonda. One huge asset was George C. Scott in the Lee J. Cobb role. The dialog was almost the same, but in much different order. A few updates were made such as the non-functioning air conditioner window unit. The original had only a large fan mounted high in a corner of the room. It's sad that type-casting prevents seeing good acting. Tony Danza did a good job, but he was still &#34;Taxi&#34; to me. I was glad to see more racial diversity, but the play is set in the 1950s, and there simply was not diversity in jury composition then. An African-American would never have been Jury Foreman, and we still have no female jurors.This version has high quality work by actors such as Hume Cronyn, Courtney Vance, Lemmon, and Danza. I find no fault with it. BUT, if you want the real thing with the real emotion and real prejudice, see the Henry Fonda version.

Don't get me wrong the first one has some strong acting, but the remake seems like more of the cast is what I would really expect. Jack Lemmon, George C. Scott, Hume Cronyn, William Petersen, Edward Olmos, Ossie Davis, and the rest the cast left more of an impression on me. The original did not impress me with people I knew on the street in the 1950s.

While not as in depth as the original, this is a worthy remake.When a young man is on trial for murder, it is up to a jury of twelve men from different ethnicities and backgrounds to decide his fate. When one juror (Jack Lemmon) boldly takes the stance that he believes the man is not guilty, it sets off fireworks and arguments in the jury room. Each man is given their chance to defend their stance, and, as they fight over whether the young man killed a person, some begin to see the errors of their judgment. Highlighted by an all-star cast, there are many well-known actors who are members of the jury, including Tony Danza, George C. Scott, and Edward James Olmos.The film's subject probably relates to anyone who has had to serve on a jury, and knows the personality clashes that exist within the jury room.  What I like about this film is that is really speaks to the idea that one person can have a huge impact in the court of law or in any part of life if they continue to trust their instincts or beliefs. Juror 8 doesn't waver in this regard. Another poignant aspect of the film is the idea of what is fair as far as the jury system goes. As depicted in the film, a few of the jury clearly just wants to ""get the case over with"" so they can go on with their regular lives.  Perhaps one of the subtle messages evoked from 12 Angry Men is that maybe there are flaws in the jury system that need to be addressed.Twelve Angry Men relies much on dialogue to create suspense (rather than action), and for the fact that they are able to capture it (in this version and in the original), I commend it. Almost the entire film takes place in the jury room with the jurors. If you need big explosions, drive-by shootings, or dramatic car chases, or blood and guts, then this might not be a film for you. This is a film that caters to dealing with the justice system, and the jurors one by one try to understand the psychology and motives of someone accused of murder.Check it out!3 1/2 stars",3,Decent remake,1200614400,"01 18, 2008",2008,2182,"['have', 'agree', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'who', 'give', 'nod', 'original', 'version', 'remake', 'still', 'decent', 'film', 'study', 'justice', 'system', 'not', 'depth', 'original', 'worthy', 'remake.When', 'young', 'man', 'trial', 'murder', 'up', 'jury', 'twelve', 'men', 'different', 'ethnicities', 'backgrounds', 'decide', 'fate', 'When', 'one', 'juror', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'boldly', 'stance', 'man', 'not', 'guilty', 'fireworks', 'arguments', 'jury', 'room', 'man', 'given', 'chance', 'defend', 'stance', 'fight', 'young', 'man', 'killed', 'person', 'begin', 'see', 'errors', 'judgment', 'Highlighted', 'all-star', 'cast', 'are', 'many', 'well-known', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'members', 'jury', 'including', 'Tony', 'Danza', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'Edward', 'James', 'Olmos.The', 'film', 'subject', 'probably', 'anyone', 'who', 'had', 'serve', 'jury', 'personality', 'exist', 'jury', 'room', 'What', 'like', 'film', 'really', 'speaks', 'idea', 'one', 'person', 'can', 'have', 'huge', 'impact', 'court', 'law', 'part', 'life', 'continue', 'trust', 'instincts', 'beliefs', '8', ""n't"", 'waver', 'regard', 'poignant', 'aspect', 'film', 'idea', 'what', 'fair', 'as', 'far', 'jury', 'system', 'depicted', 'film', 'few', 'jury', 'clearly', 'just', 'get', 'case', 'can', 'go', 'regular', 'lives', 'Perhaps', 'one', 'subtle', 'messages', 'evoked', '12', 'Angry', 'Men', 'maybe', 'are', 'flaws', 'jury', 'system', 'need', 'be', 'addressed.Twelve', 'Angry', 'Men', 'much', 'dialogue', 'create', 'suspense', 'rather', 'action', 'fact', 'are', 'able', 'capture', 'version', 'original', 'commend', 'Almost', 'entire', 'film', 'place', 'jury', 'room', 'jurors', 'need', 'big', 'explosions', 'drive-by', 'shootings', 'dramatic', 'car', 'chases', 'blood', 'guts', 'then', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'film', 'film', 'dealing', 'justice', 'system', 'jurors', 'one', 'one', 'try', 'understand', 'psychology', 'motives', 'someone', 'accused', 'murder.Check', '3', '1/2', 'stars']",N/A

158005,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,0792899830,Gregor von Kallahann,"[2, 3]","Watching this 1997 version of 12 ANGRY MEN recently, I was struck by the fact that four of the 12 actors in key roles here have since passed away.  That has absolutely nothing to do with the film's quality, of course (or nothing directly to do with it), but it is striking that key members of this impressive cast--and of course, I'm referring to Jack Lemmon, George C. Scott, Hume Cronyn and Ossie Davis-- have gone on to that jury box in the sky.As I say, the fact that these great actors have all died within the past decade is not a direct reflection on the film itself.  But it does raise at least one issue that a previous reviewer has noted: namely, the question of the cast's relative age in comparison to the cast of the 1957 classic movie version.  Jack Lemmon was 72 when he played Juror #8 in this version.  In the original film version, Henry Fonda was a comparatively youthful 52 when he portrayed the same character in 1957.  Lee J. Cobb was all of 47 when he took on the part of Juror #3.  George C. Scott was pushing 70 when he assayed the role.In Scott's case, the role of the pained father--alienated from his own son and transferring some of his rage onto the accused--rings a bit false.  He's fine until his climactic moment when he makes this association painfully clear (to all three viewers who hadn't already guessed), but at that very point, his performance unravels.  Yes, there are 70 year old men estranged from their 30-something children, but one might expect the rage to be somewhat more muted by that point.  Scott's wounds seem almost too fresh in this production.Lemmon's relative maturity is not without its own problems.  He is almost too sage.  One is never quite sure whether he is really a tentative, but tenacious truth seeker, stubbornly hashing his way through the case's many inconsistencies, or whether he's actually a fine legal mind with a grand strategy that slowly and masterfully unfolds.The obvious attempts to update the film's action are more annoying than enlightening.  It's significant that this time out, the jury is racially mixed (and ethnically too, since two of the jurors are at least vaguely European). And depending on your point of view, it may be a sign of progress overall that African-American characters can be as perceptive or as flawed as any of their cohorts.  (One even turns out to be bigoted in the extreme against the Hispanic accused.) But by 1997 could you really get away with having a jury without a single woman on it?  No, it wouldn't be the same if the film were called 10 ANGRY MEN AND A COUPLE OF WOMEN WHO AIN'T TOO HAPPY EITHER.  On the other hand, all the little updates thrown into the mix (including the presence of a female judge) do nothing to alter the fact that the movie is fundamentally anachronistic from the get-go.",3,12 Moody Guys,1215216000,"07 5, 2008",2008,2813,"['Watching', '1997', 'version', '12', 'ANGRY', 'MEN', 'recently', 'was', 'struck', 'fact', 'four', '12', 'actors', 'key', 'roles', 'here', 'have', 'passed', 'away', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'do', 'film', 'quality', 'course', 'nothing', 'directly', 'do', 'striking', 'key', 'members', 'impressive', 'cast', 'course', ""'m"", 'referring', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'Hume', 'Cronyn', 'Ossie', 'Davis', 'have', 'gone', 'jury', 'box', 'sky.As', 'say', 'fact', 'great', 'actors', 'have', 'died', 'past', 'decade', 'not', 'direct', 'reflection', 'film', 'raise', 'least', 'one', 'issue', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'noted', 'namely', 'question', 'cast', 'relative', 'age', 'comparison', 'cast', '1957', 'classic', 'movie', 'version', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'was', '72', 'when', 'played', 'Juror', '8', 'version', 'original', 'film', 'version', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'was', 'comparatively', 'youthful', '52', 'when', 'portrayed', 'same', 'character', '1957', 'Lee', 'J.', 'Cobb', 'was', '47', 'when', 'took', 'part', 'Juror', '3', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'was', 'pushing', '70', 'when', 'assayed', 'role.In', 'Scott', 'case', 'role', 'pained', 'father', 'alienated', 'own', 'son', 'transferring', 'rage', 'accused', 'bit', 'false', 'fine', 'climactic', 'moment', 'when', 'association', 'painfully', 'clear', 'three', 'viewers', 'who', 'had', ""n't"", 'already', 'guessed', 'very', 'point', 'performance', 'unravels', 'Yes', 'are', '70', 'year', 'old', 'men', 'estranged', '30-something', 'children', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'rage', 'be', 'somewhat', 'more', 'muted', 'point', 'Scott', 'wounds', 'seem', 'almost', 'too', 'fresh', 'production.Lemmon', 'relative', 'maturity', 'not', 'own', 'problems', 'almost', 'too', 'sage', 'One', 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'really', 'tentative', 'tenacious', 'truth', 'seeker', 'stubbornly', 'hashing', 'way', 'case', 'many', 'inconsistencies', 'actually', 'fine', 'legal', 'mind', 'grand', 'strategy', 'slowly', 'masterfully', 'unfolds.The', 'obvious', 'attempts', 'update', 'film', 'action', 'are', 'more', 'annoying', 'enlightening', 'significant', 'time', 'out', 'jury', 'racially', 'mixed', 'ethnically', 'too', 'two', 'jurors', 'are', 'least', 'vaguely', 'European', 'depending', 'point', 'view', 'may', 'be', 'sign', 'progress', 'overall', 'African-American', 'characters', 'can', 'be', 'perceptive', 'as', 'flawed', 'cohorts', 'One', 'even', 'out', 'be', 'bigoted', 'extreme', 'Hispanic', 'accused', '1997', 'could', 'really', 'get', 'away', 'having', 'jury', 'single', 'woman', 'No', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'same', 'film', 'were', 'called', '10', 'ANGRY', 'MEN', 'A', 'COUPLE', 'OF', 'WOMEN', 'WHO', 'AI', ""N'T"", 'TOO', 'HAPPY', 'EITHER', 'other', 'hand', 'little', 'updates', 'thrown', 'mix', 'including', 'presence', 'female', 'judge', 'do', 'nothing', 'alter', 'fact', 'movie', 'fundamentally', 'anachronistic', 'get-go']",N/A

The acting is pretty good but it lacks the passion that Henry Fonda, Lee J Cobb, Jack Klugman and the rest of the 1957 cast managed to convey to the audience as they struggled to overcome their prejudices in a case where the life of a young boy hangs in the balance.  This version has a more contemporary feel to it, the bigot is a black man with a chip on his shoulder and the Judge in charge of the overall case is a woman.  There is more background information given in this version and you get a better idea of what is happening on the outside of the jury room as well as on the inside.  You are not shut in as you are in the 1957 film.  The Director has tried to make the Jurors more human to the watching audience.  I think perhaps this is part of the reason as to why it failed to make the same impact that the 1957 version did. We knew next to nothing about these 12 angry men, they were as much a mystery to us as the crime the young Hispanic boy was supposed to have committed. The 1957 film was filled with tension and atmosphere and as the film progressed you (the audience) were drawn deeper into the jury room, which became more and more oppressive as ignorance, pettiness, bigotry and hatred oozed its way into your soul and the souls of the characters on screen.  The 1997 version was more of a mystery tale being systematically unravelled by a group of disparate men who didn't really know what they were doing most of the time.  The good points of this modern remake was that it was in colour, that the setting was contemporary and the acting though not up to the standard of Henry Fonda and his peers was adequate and watchable but sadly not memorable.

However, there is no women jury. The most interesting part of this film is member of jury who has different character, thought, race and employment. The casting of this work is more splendid compare with the original work. Jack Lemmon played a role of Henry Fonda&iexcl;s and George C. Scott played a role of Lee J. Cobb. In fact, in my opinion Jack & George are better than Henry & Lee as an acting career. In addition, their performance was great in this film. However, they were much older than Henry & Lee when they played in this film. The age is not a problem actually; by the way, it is awkward as a whole compare with the 1957 work.

Jack Lemmon and George C. Scott presage their conflicts in the later made-for-TV remake Inherit the Wind as the two jurors who refuse to budge from their convictions that a murder case does and does not have reasonable doubt attached to it, respectively.As with the original, 12 Angry Men is really an ensemble piece, the first American example of avant-garde filmmaking on a mass scale; with the exception of a few brief flashes at beginning and end, the film takes place in two adjoining rooms, a jury room and a men's room, allowing the director no scenic latitude at all and forcing him to concentrate on the actors themselves. Friedkin, as Lumet before him, gathers a mix of the well-known and the underrated from all corners of the Hollywood backlot, gives each a speech, and goes to great pains to ensure that those who espouse even the most controversial views are as charismatic as those who are warmer and fuzzier.

The way the other jurors processed the case was really like this updated and original version of 12 angry men with Henry Fonda. Jurors on the trial had places to go , predispositions about people & races and put little effort into facts of the trail. This type of jury behavior was preparing to fail the justice system. The jurors were charged with giving the victim justice by convicting the correct murderer while not putting the wrong man behind bars. Only difference race was not an issue. Thank goodness. But it affirms how it might in other jury rooms. This is not fiction. I was the only African American of 12. The Jury of 11 Caucasians were convicting the defendant based on looks, his tattoo, everything but the evidence.

So it is with William Friedkin's remake of Sidney Lumet's 1957 film. Because it sticks closely to the original script, and has a few welcome veterans in the cast, it is saved from being totally unenjoyable. But still, even George C Scott and Jack Lemmon are no match for Lee J Cobb and Henry Fonda. The original cast had a certain presence that is not even neared by the lineup of familiar faces on show here.The production also suffers from its unbelievability. Back in 1957, a few logical holes and incredulities seemed not to matter, being compensated for by the drama and tension. Set in the 1990s, however, it is simply anachronistic. Technical advances in the forensic science seem to be unknown to the characters in this transplant to modern-day. It loses credibility. The occasional changes in the dialogue are arbitrary and unnecessary at best; banal and inexplicable at worst.Overall, the Friedkin version lacks the atmosphere and tension of the original. Lumet's version was brilliantly edited and photographed so as to maximize the claustrophobic atmosphere and lend mood and ambience to the interplay of the characters. Friedkin's second-best begins with an annoying shaky camera technique and goes on to a flat cinematography style that does little to enhance the drama.At least there is the treat of rehearing Kenyon Hopkins' original theme (however briefly it is heard in both versions) rearranged for jazz quartet. It is poor compensation, however, for the disappointment of seeing a masterwork reproduced in a manner that results in a pale and unsatisfying imitation of a brilliant original.",3,Mildly enjoyable misfire,1036540800,"11 6, 2002",2002,1741,"['almost', 'always', 'bad', 'idea', 'remake', 'classic', 'movie', 'Twelve', 'Angry', 'Men', 'nigh', 'guaranteed', 'result', 'disappointment', 'William', 'Friedkin', 'remake', 'Sidney', 'Lumet', '1957', 'film', 'closely', 'original', 'script', 'few', 'welcome', 'veterans', 'cast', 'saved', 'being', 'totally', 'unenjoyable', 'still', 'even', 'George', 'C', 'Scott', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'are', 'match', 'Lee', 'J', 'Cobb', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'original', 'cast', 'had', 'certain', 'presence', 'not', 'even', 'neared', 'lineup', 'familiar', 'show', 'here.The', 'production', 'also', 'unbelievability', 'Back', '1957', 'few', 'logical', 'holes', 'incredulities', 'seemed', 'not', 'matter', 'being', 'compensated', 'drama', 'tension', 'Set', '1990s', 'however', 'simply', 'anachronistic', 'Technical', 'advances', 'forensic', 'science', 'seem', 'be', 'unknown', 'characters', 'transplant', 'modern-day', 'credibility', 'occasional', 'changes', 'dialogue', 'are', 'arbitrary', 'unnecessary', 'best', 'banal', 'inexplicable', 'worst.Overall', 'Friedkin', 'version', 'atmosphere', 'tension', 'original', 'Lumet', 'version', 'was', 'brilliantly', 'edited', 'photographed', 'so', 'maximize', 'claustrophobic', 'atmosphere', 'lend', 'mood', 'ambience', 'interplay', 'characters', 'Friedkin', 'second-best', 'begins', 'annoying', 'shaky', 'camera', 'technique', 'flat', 'cinematography', 'style', 'little', 'enhance', 'drama.At', 'least', 'treat', 'rehearing', 'Kenyon', 'Hopkins', 'original', 'theme', 'however', 'briefly', 'heard', 'versions', 'rearranged', 'jazz', 'quartet', 'poor', 'compensation', 'however', 'disappointment', 'seeing', 'masterwork', 'reproduced', 'manner', 'results', 'pale', 'unsatisfying', 'imitation', 'brilliant', 'original']",N/A
