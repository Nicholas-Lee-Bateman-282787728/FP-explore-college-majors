Generally, I have enjoyed Dutch cinema, so this was actually quite disappointing. It is not that this was a terrible film; the story was actually fairly interesting. A group of busy, very different sisters conspire to sabotage their brother's upcoming nuptials in order to safeguard a family property (he will inherit it if he marries). Having believed for years that the property was safe (because the brother was widely perceived to be gay) the sisters are shocked and band together, despite their very obvious and frequent differences. Overall not a one of the characters here is very likeable, and though I applaud films that take a candid look at real people with real personalities (likeable or not), this one just rubbed me the wrong way. It's watchable but not great by any means.",2,not great by any stretch of the imagination,1110585600,"03 12, 2005",2005,944,"['Back', 'when', 'was', 'considering', 'move', 'Holland', 'Belgium', 'was', 'immersing', 'Dutch', 'language', 'got', 'hands', 'film', 'hoping', 'best', 'Generally', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'Dutch', 'cinema', 'was', 'actually', 'quite', 'disappointing', 'not', 'was', 'terrible', 'film', 'story', 'was', 'actually', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'group', 'busy', 'very', 'different', 'sisters', 'conspire', 'sabotage', 'brother', 'upcoming', 'nuptials', 'order', 'safeguard', 'family', 'property', 'will', 'inherit', 'Having', 'believed', 'years', 'property', 'was', 'safe', 'brother', 'was', 'widely', 'perceived', 'be', 'gay', 'sisters', 'are', 'shocked', 'band', 'together', 'very', 'obvious', 'frequent', 'differences', 'Overall', 'not', 'one', 'characters', 'here', 'very', 'likeable', 'applaud', 'films', 'take', 'candid', 'look', 'real', 'people', 'real', 'personalities', 'likeable', 'not', 'one', 'just', 'rubbed', 'wrong', 'way', 'watchable', 'not', 'great', 'means']",Zus and Zo
