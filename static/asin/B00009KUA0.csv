753868,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B00009KUA0,Jeffrey Leach,"[1, 1]","""Hunting Humans,"" a zero budget serial killer flick directed by Kevin Kangas, represents the latest entry in what I like to call my fixation with all things horror. Others would call it a fixation of all things idiotic. Considering many of the films I've watched since I went out and bought a DVD player all those years ago, they would have an excellent point. I now have the opportunity to watch really great classic horror films, movies that knock your socks off with great acting, great special effects, and highly imaginative plots. Unfortunately, it's the other side of the coin that often garners the most attention, thus giving people who hate horror movies plenty of ammunition to blast the genre. ""Hunting Humans,"" in many ways, is a prime example of this latter category. Bad editing, lazy camera work, raspberry inducing dialogue, and bad acting are all on full force display here. I'm not entirely sure, but I think the movie is shot on video too. Why not? Pound another nail in the coffin! But, and this is a big but, the idea fueling the plot is intriguing enough to engage the viewer. Well, at least I thought so. Others will probably take a different tack.Anyway, ""Hunting Humans"" tells the story of Aric Blue (Rick Ganz), a beefy chap who just happens to be a serial killer. The movie opens with our boy stalking and murdering a girl in her own shower. He then proceeds to clean up with the poor gal's body hanging off the showerhead. Nice. Aric spends a lot of time talking to us in voiceover, explaining his little hobby and giving us his opinions of the people around him. Blue never has anything nice to say about those he knows, whether they are potential victims or his co-workers at his job at a real estate office. Needless to say, this cynicism and nihilism make killing his fellow humans an easy task. So does his obsession with patterns. Aric Blue is big into patterns. He knows, and explains to us in great detail, that everyone has a pattern. A guy steps outside his house for a smoke break at a certain time of day. A young woman returns home from work at the same time every day. An employee at a grocery store always arrives early in the morning to open up for business. We've all got patterns that others could readily observe and use for some nefarious purpose.Aric Blue is that somebody. He picks out his prey and then follows them around, jotting down their every move with an eye for choosing just the right moment to swoop in and stick the knife in. Or slip the rope around their neck. Or shoot them. His technique has worked wonders. Aric tells us he's killed dozens of people over the years, and he has little fear of the police. Until one day he arrives to deliver the coup de grace to a victim only to discover someone else already killed the guy. Worse, this killer left a note for Aric on the body, a note that says, ""I've got your pattern."" Oh man! The rest of the movie has Blue desperately trying to discover the identity of this killer. He keeps getting messages from the guy even as he engages in a competition with him (or her) to see who can make the biggest splash in the headlines. It's a game, but one with deadly consequences. Aric hires a private detective to try and track down the killer only to discover that the other guy also hired a P.I. to smoke him out. Hmmm. Who is this mysterious killer and who will win in the inevitable showdown? It's an odd movie that actually has you rooting for a cold-blooded killer, but ""Hunting Humans"" somehow manages to get the viewer involved in the proceedings.I already mentioned the negative aspects of the film. The technical qualities of the movie really do hamper the overall experience. Heck, by the time the film arrives at the inevitable showdown, the acting approaches pure camp. If the picture didn't have such a nifty plot, it would likely prove unwatchable. ""Hunting Humans"" IS watchable, however, because it occasionally throws out some cool stuff. The competition between Aric and his pursuer chills the blood when Blue decides to go to a movie theater for a killing spree. He moves through a sparsely attended screening methodically and silently murdering a person in the theater, slipping their body to the floor, and then moves on to the next victim. Believe me, you'll think about this film the next time you head over to the multiplex. I also enjoyed the voiceover narration; his voice is so deadpan, so monotone, that you could easily imagine he's really a serial killer. Moreover, listening to this guy is like taking a class in how to commit crimes. He talks about picking locks, disarming security devices, and figuring out how to hack into people's computers. Imagine James Bond as a total sociopath, and you'll have some idea of how Aric Blue sounds as he goes about his grim missions.Extras on the disc include a commentary with Kangas, outtakes, a photo gallery, trailers, cast and crew biographies, and a behind the scenes featurette that runs about an hour. I'm in a bit of a dilemma deciding how many stars to give the movie. ""Hunting Humans"" fails on nearly every technical level, but the plot is a worthwhile idea that's occasionally well executed. I think I'll go with three stars because I ultimately did enjoy the film. In a zero budget horror film world populated with dreck like ""Shatter Dead"" and ""Peter Rottentail,"" it's nice to know a few worthy efforts do exist.",3,Cool plot but technically
