1589529,A2335RXR1K4MG9,B00996RSYM,2bez2seem,"[0, 0]","&#34;The Falls&#34;  is far from being an epic.  At least in the Star Wars, Gone with the Wind, Doctor Zhivago sense.  It doesn't have to be.  It portrays in a quiet, subtle, serious way a forbidden love and its outcome within a restrictive and--dare I say it?--almost incomprehensible environment of sanctioned religious lack of understanding and organized bigotry. The LDS's refusal to comprehend the realities of divergent sexual feelings is a true insult and affront toward the all-encompassing love of Jesus Christ.Other reviewers have given the film positive reviews, with maybe a negative comment about this or that presumed flaw. That's good.  The acting is nonetheless excellent for two budding, novice actors (to whom I offer a heartfelt hope that both  may achieve success in a profession that is, by all accounts, a cutthroat business.  Nick Ferrucci, portraying RJ, indeed has a deadpan delivery.  But I think it is a studied delivery based on his interpretation of the character's essential vocational seriousness. And Benjamin Farmer's Chris is subdued yet deeply emotional and conflicted. And Brian Allard is enchanting as the pot-smoking friend who accepts RJ and Chris unconditionally.I have not yet seen the sequel &#34;Testament of Love.&#34;  I have it coming from a supplier.  This first movie is wonderful and the actors perform with grace, humility, doubt, and dignity.  For a gay audience it is a revelation of what beautiful feelings, Godlike feelings, that fill a vacuum gays have always been hoping to see and vicariously experience.",5,Sincere sweet revelations,1398211200,"04 23, 2014",2014,1561,"['34', 'Falls', '34', 'far', 'being', 'epic', 'least', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'Doctor', 'Zhivago', 'sense', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'quiet', 'subtle', 'serious', 'way', 'forbidden', 'love', 'outcome', 'restrictive', 'dare', 'say', 'almost', 'incomprehensible', 'environment', 'sanctioned', 'religious', 'lack', 'understanding', 'organized', 'bigotry', 'LDS', 'refusal', 'comprehend', 'realities', 'divergent', 'sexual', 'feelings', 'true', 'insult', 'affront', 'all-encompassing', 'love', 'Jesus', 'Christ.Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'given', 'film', 'positive', 'reviews', 'maybe', 'negative', 'comment', 'presumed', 'flaw', 'good', 'acting', 'nonetheless', 'excellent', 'two', 'budding', 'novice', 'actors', 'whom', 'offer', 'heartfelt', 'hope', 'may', 'achieve', 'success', 'profession', 'accounts', 'cutthroat', 'business', 'Nick', 'Ferrucci', 'portraying', 'RJ', 'indeed', 'deadpan', 'delivery', 'think', 'studied', 'delivery', 'based', 'interpretation', 'character', 'essential', 'vocational', 'seriousness', 'Benjamin', 'Farmer', 'Chris', 'subdued', 'yet', 'deeply', 'emotional', 'conflicted', 'Brian', 'Allard', 'enchanting', 'pot-smoking', 'friend', 'who', 'RJ', 'Chris', 'unconditionally.I', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'seen', 'sequel', '34', 'Testament', 'Love.', '34', 'have', 'coming', 'supplier', 'first', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'actors', 'perform', 'grace', 'humility', 'doubt', 'dignity', 'gay', 'audience', 'revelation', 'what', 'beautiful', 'feelings', 'Godlike', 'feelings', 'vacuum', 'gays', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'hoping', 'see', 'vicariously', 'experience']",The Falls
1589530,A3UE57S8G2G72Y,B00996RSYM,A Customer,"[3, 4]","I enjoyed watching this movie. The story is about a guy named Richard who goes on a trip to convert people to the Mormon faith then he falls in love with Chris, his companion. The movie is not just about love, it's about the struggle of being gay in a community that does not tolerate homosexuality. I love how you can see a map of the world in one of the scenes; it's very beautiful. Spoiler alert! Some parts were very funny--like the responses some people were giving him as reasons not to listen to what he wanted to say about his religion and what a guy said to him and his partner about having life experiences, the military being a place for people doing things and how he noticed that they were not trying to convert him anymore. It was not just what he was saying, it was the way he said them. He's just a funny guy. Way before this part, one guy tricked them into making them believe he did not know anything about the Mormon faith only for them to discover that this wasn't true. This was also funny. The humour does not stop here. There are some emotional parts like towards the end of the film when he was telling one of his superiors that he was basically in love with Chris, and that he was not ashamed of being gay. The way he cried as he said these words was beautiful and moving. I also love how he looked at Chris one night when he was sleeping. I don't like that they got insulted, but sometimes this happens. I have a problem with the colour of Jesus depicted, but I am not going to focus on it. As someone who doesn't do drugs in any way, shape or form, it was interesting to see how it's done, but this doesn't mean that I am in support of it.

It is unfair to compare them, because each deals with with a different reality.  The first exposes the extremes of physical and emotional cruelty the Mormons apply to young gay men in their attemps at ""conversion"" therapy.  The second details a spiritual crisis leading to the questioning of a ""religion?"" that is unyielding in its rejection of difference. Nick Ferrucci is simply stunning as the young man who is not afraid to reaffirm his right to love whomever he pleases.

The story of two, 20-year old Mormon men doing their missionary service in Oregon who find themselves attracted to each other with no way to reconcile their feelings without violating their church's teachings.  The soul-searching is wholly believable and the outcomes equally so.The two lead actors are pretty close to perfect in their roles--making the viewer understand their dilemma and hoping for the best possible outcome.

1589535,A23P6AYU57RLO,B00996RSYM,"Bob Drake ""BobDrake""","[7, 10]","The assumption might be that, because of the LGBT festival palms on the box cover, this film is a replay of the 2003 filmLatter Days (R-Rated  Edition), but it is a different point of view, since that film was about a missionary and a neighbor, a non-Mormon, whereas this is about two missionary partners.I am aware of the LDS view of homosexuality from a couple of books,Hard Fall, by James Buchanan (a woman), andNo Going Back, by a father of three and author of a Mormon encyclopedia. Hard Fall tells the story of a park ranger in Mormon country who consorts with a young drifter-rock climber and gets in dutch with the LDS bishop when a colorful 2-way radio exchange between the two is overheard, and No Going Back is about a gay teen who comes clean about his homosexuality with his straight best friend and his friend's bishop father, but gets the LDS third degree anyway. (Read my reviews of both books.)Here the intent of both young men is to serve the LDS church and their families to the best of their abilities, but, through some realistic, unforeseen, stressful events, their mutual reserves are breached, and they become more to each other than missionary partners. The story could be autobiographical.As with Latter Days, the narrator is put through the ringer, but here remains true to himself and close to his Mormon faith. And the final scene gives the audience a ray of hope that all will be well.The soundtrack is well done. The first track is by gay singer-songwriter Jay Brannan and it fits the mood of the film at that point very well. (His new album isRob Me Blind Deluxe Edition (Includes Extended Booklet + Bonus Download of Live at Eddie's Attic).)The film gets four stars for originality and script but loses one for the age of the ""20 year old"" missionaries and the not-quite-professional acting and production. All in all The Falls has better production values than many gay films, though dialog was recorded on top of open window and road noise. It is certainly a worthwhile film, though it is clear that the LDS faith has no place for non-celebate homosexuals, and that Mormons are quite possessive of the image of missionaries -- though The PBS Frontline/American ExperienceThe Mormonsexposed the salesmanship aspect of LDS missionary training. The message here is much more hopeful than the dire, dark No Turning Back book.",4,The Falls: Love Is Not A Sin,1356825600,"12 30, 2012",2012,2356,"['assumption', 'might', 'be', 'LGBT', 'festival', 'palms', 'box', 'cover', 'film', 'replay', '2003', 'filmLatter', 'Days', 'R-Rated', 'Edition', 'different', 'point', 'view', 'film', 'was', 'missionary', 'neighbor', 'non-Mormon', 'about', 'two', 'missionary', 'partners.I', 'am', 'aware', 'LDS', 'view', 'homosexuality', 'couple', 'books', 'Hard', 'Fall', 'James', 'Buchanan', 'woman', 'Going', 'Back', 'father', 'three', 'author', 'Mormon', 'encyclopedia', 'Hard', 'Fall', 'story', 'park', 'ranger', 'Mormon', 'country', 'who', 'young', 'drifter-rock', 'climber', 'dutch', 'LDS', 'bishop', 'when', 'colorful', '2-way', 'radio', 'exchange', 'two', 'overheard', 'Going', 'Back', 'gay', 'teen', 'who', 'clean', 'homosexuality', 'straight', 'best', 'friend', 'friend', 'bishop', 'father', 'LDS', 'third', 'degree', 'anyway', 'Read', 'reviews', 'books', 'Here', 'intent', 'young', 'men', 'serve', 'LDS', 'church', 'families', 'best', 'abilities', 'realistic', 'unforeseen', 'stressful', 'events', 'mutual', 'reserves', 'are', 'breached', 'become', 'more', 'other', 'missionary', 'partners', 'story', 'could', 'be', 'autobiographical.As', 'Latter', 'Days', 'narrator', 'put', 'ringer', 'here', 'true', 'close', 'Mormon', 'faith', 'final', 'scene', 'audience', 'ray', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'well.The', 'soundtrack', 'well', 'done', 'first', 'track', 'gay', 'singer-songwriter', 'Jay', 'Brannan', 'mood', 'film', 'point', 'very', 'well', 'new', 'album', 'isRob', 'Me', 'Blind', 'Deluxe', 'Edition', 'Includes', 'Extended', 'Booklet', '+', 'Bonus', 'Download', 'Live', 'Eddie', 'Attic', 'film', 'four', 'stars', 'originality', 'script', 'one', 'age', '20', 'year', 'old', 'missionaries', 'not-quite-professional', 'acting', 'production', 'Falls', 'better', 'production', 'values', 'many', 'gay', 'films', 'dialog', 'was', 'recorded', 'top', 'open', 'window', 'road', 'noise', 'certainly', 'worthwhile', 'film', 'clear', 'LDS', 'faith', 'place', 'non-celebate', 'homosexuals', 'Mormons', 'are', 'quite', 'possessive', 'image', 'missionaries', 'PBS', 'Frontline/American', 'ExperienceThe', 'Mormonsexposed', 'salesmanship', 'aspect', 'LDS', 'missionary', 'training', 'message', 'here', 'much', 'more', 'hopeful', 'dire', 'dark', 'No', 'Turning', 'Back', 'book']",The Falls

He is paired with Chris Merrill, also 20, who has already been at that work for a while, and the duo is expected to spend every moment of the day and night together.  As is the custom, RJ must follow Chris' lead, as he is the more experienced of the two, and RJ respects that, which makes it more difficult for him to understand when Chris loses control when they are verbally attacked by a potential convert who challenges the Church's stand on polygamy. RJ also must take charge when they encounter a couple of homophobic rednecks who hate Mormons.It is not until later in the movie that it is established that both RJ and Chris had been repressing feelings that they could be gay, and the closeness between the two eventually develops into a loving, physical relationship ...  one that, if it is discovered, could force then from the church and possibly alienate them from their families.This film has been compared to ""Latter Days,"" another film about a gay Mormon missionary, but is actually quite different, on several levels. It seems more realistic to me, in depicting the mindset of the two young men as they face a life-changing decision. The cast of mostly unknown actors performs well, and - except for some issues with dialogue being drowned out by background music and noise - the production values are good.My advance screener copy did not have the additional ""Making of..."" featurette (which is the norm for screeners), but surprisingly also had no credits, either opening or closing.

[No Greg Appelt, I didn't sleep with any Mormon missionaries.]  Nearly 11 years ago, I had the chance to have a series of very interesting one-on-two meetings with two Mormon Elders - Elder Dalahanse and Elder Butler at the Barnes & Noble nearby.  There is a photo here on my Facebook page that  President Green took of me with both of them.  While I suspected and still do that Elder Dalahanse and Elder Butler were trying for the &#34;Ah-Ha&#34; moment in attempting to convert a stalwart Jew to Mormonism - wasn't and still ain't happening Elders; I still have the Book of Mormon in which they wrote of their love for me.  I also still have the oragami scorpion they gave me neatly tucked away in one of my bookcases.  [Regina Stebbins - a former co-worker of mine didn't like the fact that they gave me a scoprion and wanted me to have absolutely nothing to do with them after that.]&#34;The Falls&#34; is quiet and understated story telling at its best.  Both RJ and Chris are compelling characters who respond in unexpected ways when confronted with the religious fallout when their intense relationship is discovered and outed.While Elder Dalahanse was happy and pleased that I considered then, and still do, &#34;The Book of Mormon&#34; to be a holy book - it is to Mormon's what the Koran is to Musilms - I think my favorite line in this whole movie is:  &#34;We're bad Mormons, aren't we?&#34;RJ and Chris must answer that question themselves separately when the Mormon Church threatens to ex-communicate them.Highly Recommended!Five Stars!",5,Powerful Story!,1397088000,"04 10, 2014",2014,1685,"['Just', 'finished', 'watching', '34', 'Falls', '34', 'released', 'Breaking', 'Glass', 'Pictures.Before', 'proceeding', 'must', 'make', 'full', 'disclosure', 'here', '[', 'Greg', 'Appelt', 'did', ""n't"", 'sleep', 'Mormon', 'missionaries', ']', 'Nearly', '11', 'years', 'ago', 'had', 'chance', 'have', 'series', 'very', 'interesting', 'one-on-two', 'meetings', 'two', 'Mormon', 'Elders', 'Elder', 'Dalahanse', 'Elder', 'Butler', 'Barnes', 'Noble', 'nearby', 'photo', 'here', 'Facebook', 'page', 'President', 'Green', 'took', 'suspected', 'still', 'do', 'Elder', 'Dalahanse', 'Elder', 'Butler', 'were', 'trying', '34', 'Ah-Ha', '34', 'moment', 'attempting', 'convert', 'stalwart', 'Jew', 'Mormonism', 'was', ""n't"", 'still', 'ai', ""n't"", 'happening', 'Elders', 'still', 'have', 'Book', 'Mormon', 'wrote', 'love', 'also', 'still', 'have', 'oragami', 'scorpion', 'gave', 'neatly', 'tucked', 'away', 'one', 'bookcases', '[', 'Regina', 'Stebbins', 'former', 'co-worker', 'mine', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'fact', 'gave', 'scoprion', 'wanted', 'have', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'do', ']', '34', 'Falls', '34', 'quiet', 'understated', 'story', 'telling', 'best', 'RJ', 'Chris', 'are', 'compelling', 'characters', 'who', 'respond', 'unexpected', 'ways', 'when', 'confronted', 'religious', 'fallout', 'when', 'intense', 'relationship', 'discovered', 'outed.While', 'Elder', 'Dalahanse', 'was', 'happy', 'pleased', 'considered', 'then', 'still', 'do', '34', 'Book', 'Mormon', '34', 'be', 'holy', 'book', 'Mormon', 'what', 'Koran', 'Musilms', 'think', 'favorite', 'line', 'whole', 'movie', '34', ""'re"", 'bad', 'Mormons', 'are', ""n't"", '34', 'RJ', 'Chris', 'must', 'answer', 'question', 'separately', 'when', 'Mormon', 'Church', 'ex-communicate', 'them.Highly', 'Recommended', 'Five', 'Stars']",The Falls
1589552,A8QG61LYK0XO1,B00996RSYM,JUST A REVIEWER2,"[1, 2]",".....young men and their love for Jesus Christ, family, church (and, sometimes, each other) is near enthralling....and watchable again and again.A ""Realistic Primer"" (in the film's beginning) of the daily lives of Young Couples (male, Mormon Companions) on a Mission.  In this story, we're introduced to a dorm-like setting of a simple double room, with basic kitchen.  We watch as the Companions (always staying together, as a pair) are introduced to their new commitments and goals, their rules of conduct, and submission of required progress reports.  Everything arranged for them....everything with a purpose.((  NOTE:  We learn, in the Special Features section of this DVD, that Writer/Director, Jon Garcia, was a neophyte (newbie) to things Mormon....and had to ""study up"" on his subject (unlike C. Jay Cox, the EX-Mormon and Director of 2003's ""Latter Days""  ))OUR CAST OF ACTORS (only the primaries):- Actor Nick Ferrucci, as R. J. Smith.  (I call him:  ""He Who Bringeth Out Joy"").  Playing a young 20-year old Man on a Mission (2 years long), we follow him from film beginning to end.  And at the start he informs us:  ""Mormon Faith truly is a benefactor of wholesomeness.""  BUT...the question later becomes:  can R. J. stick to that belief?  At any rate, here is a good time to point out that he is our Hug-Guy--some Accomplishments deserve one. And if there is any such thing as a ""Light-Hearted"" Mormon Missionary, R. J. often comes close.  You'll recognize this later on as he backtalks his Companion, Chris, in an effort to get him to ""lighten up"" and into a better mood.- Actor Benjamin Farmer, as Chris Merril.  (I call him:  ""He Who Maketh the First Move""). As R. J.s Mormon Companion and Senior Elder, Chris has been on other missions (there, perhaps, is the rub).  A sometimes fervent young man, Elder Chris is our Serious one.  But, it won't take you long to realize that things have begun to rankle this Missionary.  He's begun ""to question"".- Actor Brian Allard, as Rodney.  (I call him:  ""He Who Enlightenth Our Lives"").  Plays a pot-smoking, ex-Iraq war vet, with much of a PTSD personality (or maybe not....he could be our sanest character).  Despite his truly horrible experience in that war zone, he will have you absolutely rolling off your seats laughing when he is at his best.  He's lovable...he's understanding.  And frankly, he could be the best thing which happens to our R. J. and Chris.Despite all we learn about the Mormon Religion (and it's not always Christ-like), make no mistake about what I say next:  ....THIS IS, AT ITS ROOT, A LOVE STORY BETWEEN TWO MEN.  And so, as the story edges to its end, we find R. J. experiencing increasingly caring thoughts (and concerns) for his withdrawn Companion, Chris. Which then leads to a series of notable events:- A diner table discussion, between our Companions, of R. J.s concern over Chris slackening off....resulting in a surprise, Hand-Touching-Hand moment. Which then leads to:- An accusation of ""Faggotry"" against them....resulting in a fight by R. J. in protecting themselves. Which then leads to:- Bruised knuckles....resulting in Hand-Holding, in the applying of an ice pack (a nice little moment). Which then leads to:- Exhaustion and early drop off into sleep by Chris....leaving R. J. to prepare for bed, say his prayers and, then, to gaze at a sleeping Chris, before turning out the light. For me, this is THE point at which I knew Love existed between them. We can see it in R. J.s face....we can see it in his eyes. It is ""The Defining Moment"".This film also contains an absolutely heart-rending denouement (outcome) scene between R. J. and his church Stake President.  It is one of the strongest performances you will see by a young actor.  While it will tear at your heart....it is NOT an apology scene and is extremely well written.....leaving us the possibility of hope for our two young men.  Will the moments later Final Scene confirm that for us?Memorable Moments:  A Bus-ride Kiss.  In fact, every kiss these actors bring to one another....seems real...seems meant.  How rare!PS--Production values are quite high for this Indie Film.  Particular mention is deserved for the wonderful film score, music and lyrics.  Made up of very simple piano, guitar and vocal harmonics, this score will absolutely grab you.  A musical standout for me was the near film end ""Coda of Discovery"" (they are found out).****",4,"The ""Intense Buildup"" we're given in this story of.....",1356220800,"12 23, 2012",2012,4410,"['..young', 'men', 'love', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'family', 'church', 'sometimes', 'other', 'near', 'enthralling', '.and', 'watchable', 'again', 'again.A', 'Realistic', 'Primer', 'film', 'beginning', 'daily', 'lives', 'Young', 'Couples', 'male', 'Mormon', 'Companions', 'Mission', 'story', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'dorm-like', 'setting', 'simple', 'double', 'room', 'basic', 'kitchen', 'watch', 'Companions', 'always', 'staying', 'together', 'pair', 'are', 'introduced', 'new', 'commitments', 'goals', 'rules', 'conduct', 'submission', 'required', 'progress', 'reports', 'Everything', 'arranged', '.everything', 'purpose', 'NOTE', 'learn', 'Special', 'Features', 'section', 'DVD', 'Writer/Director', 'Jon', 'Garcia', 'was', 'neophyte', 'newbie', 'things', 'Mormon', '.and', 'had', 'study', 'up', 'subject', 'C.', 'Jay', 'Cox', 'EX-Mormon', 'Director', '2003', 'Latter', 'Days', 'OUR', 'CAST', 'OF', 'ACTORS', 'only', 'primaries', 'Actor', 'Nick', 'Ferrucci', 'R.', 'J.', 'Smith', 'call', 'Who', 'Out', 'Joy', 'Playing', 'young', '20-year', 'old', 'Man', 'Mission', '2', 'years', 'long', 'follow', 'film', 'beginning', 'end', 'start', 'Mormon', 'Faith', 'truly', 'benefactor', 'wholesomeness', 'BUT', 'question', 'later', 'can', 'R.', 'J.', 'stick', 'belief', 'rate', 'here', 'good', 'time', 'point', 'out', 'Hug-Guy', 'Accomplishments', 'deserve', 'one', 'such', 'thing', 'Light-Hearted', 'Mormon', 'Missionary', 'R.', 'J.', 'often', 'close', ""'ll"", 'recognize', 'later', 'Companion', 'Chris', 'effort', 'get', 'lighten', 'up', 'better', 'mood.-', 'Actor', 'Benjamin', 'Farmer', 'Chris', 'Merril', 'call', 'Who', 'Maketh', 'First', 'Move', 'R.', 'J.s', 'Mormon', 'Companion', 'Senior', 'Elder', 'Chris', 'been', 'other', 'missions', 'there', 'perhaps', 'rub', 'sometimes', 'fervent', 'young', 'man', 'Elder', 'Chris', 'Serious', 'one', 'wo', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'realize', 'things', 'have', 'begun', 'rankle', 'Missionary', 'begun', 'question', '.-', 'Actor', 'Brian', 'Allard', 'Rodney', 'call', 'Who', 'Enlightenth', 'Lives', 'pot-smoking', 'ex-Iraq', 'war', 'vet', 'much', 'PTSD', 'personality', 'maybe', 'not', '.he', 'could', 'be', 'sanest', 'character', 'truly', 'horrible', 'experience', 'war', 'zone', 'will', 'have', 'absolutely', 'rolling', 'off', 'seats', 'laughing', 'when', 'best', 'lovable', 'understanding', 'frankly', 'could', 'be', 'best', 'thing', 'R.', 'J.', 'Chris.Despite', 'learn', 'Mormon', 'Religion', 'not', 'always', 'Christ-like', 'make', 'mistake', 'what', 'say', 'next', '.THIS', 'AT', 'ITS', 'ROOT', 'A', 'LOVE', 'STORY', 'BETWEEN', 'TWO', 'MEN', 'so', 'story', 'end', 'find', 'R.', 'J.', 'experiencing', 'increasingly', 'caring', 'thoughts', 'concerns', 'withdrawn', 'Companion', 'Chris', 'Which', 'then', 'series', 'notable', 'events', 'diner', 'table', 'discussion', 'Companions', 'R.', 'J.s', 'concern', 'Chris', 'slackening', 'off', '.resulting', 'surprise', 'Hand-Touching-Hand', 'moment', 'Which', 'then', 'accusation', 'Faggotry', '.resulting', 'fight', 'R.', 'J.', 'protecting', 'Which', 'then', 'Bruised', 'knuckles', '.resulting', 'Hand-Holding', 'applying', 'ice', 'pack', 'nice', 'little', 'moment', 'Which', 'then', 'Exhaustion', 'early', 'drop', 'sleep', 'Chris', '.leaving', 'R.', 'J.', 'prepare', 'bed', 'say', 'prayers', 'then', 'gaze', 'sleeping', 'Chris', 'turning', 'out', 'light', 'point', 'knew', 'Love', 'existed', 'can', 'see', 'R.', 'J.s', 'face', 'can', 'see', 'eyes', 'Defining', 'Moment', '.This', 'film', 'also', 'absolutely', 'heart-rending', 'denouement', 'outcome', 'scene', 'R.', 'J.', 'church', 'Stake', 'President', 'one', 'strongest', 'performances', 'will', 'see', 'young', 'actor', 'will', 'tear', 'heart', '.it', 'NOT', 'apology', 'scene', 'extremely', 'well', 'written', '..leaving', 'possibility', 'hope', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'Will', 'moments', 'later', 'Final', 'Scene', 'confirm', 'Memorable', 'Moments', 'Bus-ride', 'Kiss', 'fact', 'kiss', 'actors', 'bring', 'one', 'real', 'meant', 'How', 'rare', 'PS', 'Production', 'values', 'are', 'quite', 'high', 'Indie', 'Film', 'Particular', 'mention', 'deserved', 'wonderful', 'film', 'score', 'music', 'lyrics', 'Made', 'very', 'simple', 'piano', 'guitar', 'vocal', 'harmonics', 'score', 'will', 'absolutely', 'grab', 'musical', 'standout', 'was', 'near', 'film', 'end', 'Coda', 'Discovery', 'are', 'found', 'out', '****']",The Falls

That said, the pacing naturally feels a lot slower than the rest of the movie as we too get sucked into their daily routine of waking up early, saying their prayers and trying to give out pamphlets to passers by. This part of the movie is not done in a manner that passes judgement for or against the Mormon faith - it just seems to present it as is and leaves it to the audience to form their own opinions.Things naturally shift when the two give into their feelings and start exploring their sexuality together. We don't go as far as them suddenly dressing in a flamboyant manner or hitting the nearest gay club - all of which are pretty ridiculous alternatives. However we do have them practically showing of in front of one of the folks they were unable to convert.You know that the religious angle has to come back around to bite them in the butt - it seems to be a requirement for any gay movie with strong religious themes. And in this regard there's still the confrontation, but I didn't feel like there was a strong resolution to things. Perhaps it was an effort not to seem to be attacking the Mormon religion too harshly. But given that it really doesn't take a stand - just has these two young men struggling with their feelings in contrast to their religion.The Falls is heavy, but not in a cerebral, fulfilling way.

Elder Smith and Elder Merril are made &#8216;companions&#8217; for to go out converting people or giving away free copies of the Book of Mormon. This new joining they start &#8216;with a prayer&#8217;. Anyway we start to get to know them and their pasts and they actually came across as very believable characters.On their converting missions they happen upon the door of a Vietnam veteran called Rodney (Brian Allard) who has the most amazing voice and was my favourite character. He helps them realise there is more to life that nice teeth and clean shirts. Well they start to have feelings for each other but as Mormon&#8217;s aren&#8217;t exactly into the &#8216;summer of free love&#8217; type ethos it is pretty obvious that their new found &#8216;companionship&#8217; is going to bring a lot of grief.I actually liked this film but there are a few howevers, and the first one is production values. This is a small budget film and as such you know there will be some issues. The first was background noise, we have squeaking floor boards and variations in the sound level as this has been obviously taped live with the acting, which I do not have a problem with and it gives it a kind of doco drama feel to the whole thing. There are a couple of plot holes that had me harrumphing a bit but they are not too obvious.There is no bedroom Olympics either which I was sort of looking forward to as I was feeling shallow when I watched this, but on the strong point there was an attempt to examine the theology that gives credence to out dated homophobic reactions which was sadly missed in &#8216;The Seminarian&#8217;.
