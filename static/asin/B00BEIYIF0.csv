1628435,A2DI9XP5ITS3P,B00BEIYIF0,"Allegrobas ""Allegrobas""","[0, 1]","Incredibly fast moving thriller about a 911 emergency dealing with a kidnapping and several murders. The story is believable, the plot is tight with minimal irrelevant material, and the acting is incredible. Halle Berry does a good job as the strung-out and anxious operator with lots of self-doubts. Michael Eklund does a great job as a truly scary, sadistic, and sociopathic kidnapper. But the most intense performance is delivered by Abigail Breslin as the terrorized teen girl who spends a good deal of time captive in a car trunk. Because of this plot restriction she delivers her performance mostly by her facial expressions and by how she speaks, whispers, mumbles, screams, and cries her lines. What a magnificent job!!! This would have been a perfect 10 for this thriller, but unfortunately the ending was weak and not in spirit with the rest of the film. In my opinion even the acting by the characters in the last 3 minutes of the movie broke off course and seemed artificial---not in character.  It was as if the director had said, ""OK, let's get this thing done and let's go home. We're all tired.""

Yes, there was some gratuitous violence and creepy serial-killer-craziness, but the plot never stopped and it was very entertaining.  I won't give it away, but I loved the ending!This movie is about a 9-1-1 operator who gets a home invasion call from a young teenage girl.  Halle Berry did a great job portraying the operator.  I watched it with my older daughter and we were shrieking and cringing and cheering.  Some people might find the ending too gift-wrapped-and-tied-with-a-bow, but I am not into depressing, dark movies with miserable, 'realistic' endings- get enough of that in the news these days.Fun, thrilling and quite the ride.  I wouldn't recommend for younger kids- bad language and there are a couple murders (since it is about a serial killer) which generally isn't content I want my kids watching.  It was very entertaining and I was completely drawn in.  Other reviewers have said there were too many unrealistic scenarios- my answer to that is, ""What did you expect?  It isn't a documentary!  It's a fictitious movie!"".  And nice that it wasn't full of gratuitous sex, unlikeable characters and jaded relationship junk.  I enjoyed it.  May not be for you if you don't like crime shows/thrillers- since this is pretty much what the movie is about.Gotta love a movie with some poetic justice where the good guys win!

The actors' portrayals of their characters were so realistic. This was a low budget movie that has more than made its money back because of superior acting and a solid supporting cast. It really kept me on the edge of my seat as I rooted for plucky Abigail Benson (And Later Halle Berry) to escape her tormenter. I cared for both ladies and all the principle characters and wanted the best for all of them. I felt sorry for the box cutter guy who tried to intervene and lost his life as a result. Mike Imperioli's cameo was also well designed.SPOILER ALERTThe end of this movie showcased girlpower at its best as the two ladies overcome a vicious monster and turn the tables on him in the end, chaining him to his own chair where he will slowly die of dehydration. Seeing him in this predicament had a small and tiny (Microscopic) part of me feeling sorry for him-- but I got over it; he did indeed get what he deserved. The ending was so original. As I've said in response comments to some others, I expected Halle's beau to drive in and save the day with the rest of the LAPD. I was actually surprised that they did not keep a few guys at the scene in case he returned to the cottage they had raided. But the ending really did it for me. I've never seen one like that and could only applaud the writer and director.As of this writing I'm the 10th person to review this movie and the eighth Five-Star reviewer.

It's a good crime-thriller. Very exciting, edge of your seat premise. And an overall pretty interesting plot. Then it makes this complete U-turn into being a really bad, poorly written movie.There's a moment in this film where you can tell that the writers couldn't come up with a good enough ending, that wasn't cliche. So instead they chose to ruin the integrity of the entire movie, with the most ridiculous, improbable, cringe-worthy third act.It's easily one of the worst endings in cinema history. The final act of this film completely contradicts everything you learned from the first two acts.

Are they believable in their rolls?  EVERY actor/actress in this movie performed PERFECTLY, in my judgment.  ALL were believable.Direction - I do not know much about the production of movies, TV shows, etc.  It is my understanding that it is the job of the director to envision the script and to bring it to life on the screen by molding the performances of the actors/actresses.  IF my understanding is correct, then Brad Anderson did a magnificent job.Lighting, photography, costuming - all perfect for my taste.The Totality of the film - Tense, fully BELIEVABLE, maybe too much so, because my heart was pounding.

Translation: if you want to enjoy it, you have to make your own fun... or just make fun of it.Calling Elle Fanning!! Calling Chloe Moritz!! Oh sorry, you two are off starring in better movies. Damn, either one of you could have really made this a Super-8 of a Kick-Ass flick. Point being, Abigail Breslin is completely mis-cast in this movie and I couldn't help but root for the villain to end MY pain by ending her; which, alas did not happen. Abby's acting chops are pretty shabby in believably emoting the pain her character SHOULD be in by time we reach the finale. Unfortunately, Shabby Abby is just a recognizable name from an indie sweetheart of a movie and completely unable to pull off this role. The two other teen chicks featured in this movie, with very short-lived parts, would have done a better job with the lead role than Little Ms. Breslin. Sorry girl, but even running around in all your glory in a bra and tight jeans can't save you, or this movie (which begs the question, was this outfit a necessary costume change Mr. Director?)Note: if you dare to depart on this movie's misaligned adventure and make it all the way to the end, you're in for a little gem of a Razzie worth, albeit unintentionally hilarious scene. Not many horrifically traumatized and beaten victims with a bleeding skull and blood-sack for an eye, can come face-to-face with the bad guy and deliver a line, as conveyed by her little-girl-sass, that should have ended with the words: Nah nah-nah-nah nah Mr. Poo-poo head... Oh boy does she suck; and by the way, when you reach this point and realize that Halle is suddenly sans her jacket, you too might consider the idea that Shabby Abby's character should now be wearing it (hell, anyone might if they were bloody, beaten and limping around in a bra on a chilly night that sparked jacket wearing), but since this movie has departed from reality, just throw all things that make sense out the window. Including the contemplation why Halle's character has suddenly transformed into a rogue Clarice Starling-slash-McGruff the weaponless crime-dog crusader when she has access to the city's entire network of emergency service rescue units... but then we wouldn't have this goofy movie! Touche monsieur pussycat.In the end I was more sorry that Michael Imperioli and Morris Chestnut, who both brought a little life into this movie, didn't have more screen time and more integral parts. However, the director will get props for this much - it certainly is not a forgettable film. I will always relish being able to predict spot-on what the characters were going to do right before they carried out the actions.

So, she tracked down the kidnapper by herself even though she knew he had killed 2 people before. She did not even bring any weapon. Yeah, right! Then she and the victim resolved it.  It is so far-fetched that it's laughable.From what I know, in reality, no ordinary kidnapped victims and no regular outsiders could have solved it by themselves.

1628498,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00BEIYIF0,C. Sawin,"[9, 14]","It's just another night on the job for 911 operator Jordan Turner (Halle Berry) until she gets a phone call from a girl who is home alone during a break-in. Thanks to Jordan's poor decision making, the girl is eventually kidnapped and her body turns up shortly thereafter. Six months later and Jordan has stepped away from the floor while taking on the task of training the new recruits. A panicked call leads to Jordan taking the wheel for the first time in months. A young girl has been abducted and Jordan has been knighted her only means of life support. As the case begins to unravel, Jordan begins to think that the two cases are connected and is determined not to make the same mistake twice.With ""Dead Man Down"" being released last week, expectations weren't very high for ""The Call"" since both films are being released by WWE Studios. ""The Call"" nearly powers through lowered expectations in its first half though. The film starts off with what sounds like real 911 calls. The calls eventually shift from being tragic and slightly violent to pretty humorous (""I shot my wife. Yeah! She's lying on the floor!"" ""My uncle stabbed my mom in the leg. She's pretty pissed off."") You witness how slow Jordan's job can be and how off guard an urgent phone call can catch someone. It's like a slow burn for what's to come. Once Leah Templeton (Evie Thompson) is abducted is when the suspense crashes over you like a tsunami wave. There is so much tension in this film. The thick, tense atmosphere is what makes the film seem decent in its first half and then everything just comes to a screeching halt.Jordan's guard is way down after her boyfriend Officer Paul Phillips (Morris Chestnut) visits her and they share a nice little canoodling moment. Thinking of what was to come later that night and the slow night at work she had had up to that point caused her to react poorly and cost Leah her life. This seems smart compared to what other people do in this film. These are the dumbest individuals to ever grace the streets of Los Angeles. If you caught a guy red-handed with a kidnapped girl in his back seat, would you honestly try to make your point with a freaking box cutter? Everybody sits around and watches and listens to Jordan's call with the current abducted girl Casey Welson (Abigail Breslin). Earlier in the film, Jordan makes it a point to say ""The Hive"" is what keeps the city running. That's why security is so tight. So nobody else had any emergency calls to take? There was nothing better to do?If this is your first time seeing Michael Eklund in anything, don't write him off just yet. He's a pretty talented actor and always does a fantastic job portraying those jarring characters not many could pull off well. Do yourself a favor and watch Xavier Gens ""The Divide."" In the meantime, Eklund is Michael Foster; the man responsible for all of these current kidnappings and abductions. His body language and reactions are incredible, but his dialogue is really flat so it at least seems like he tried to do the best he could with what he had.""The Call"" throws logic out the window during its finale. It actually feels like it throws everything out the window and starts from scratch in its final moments as characters take things into their own hands and there's a hint of ""Saw"" in its conclusion. ""The Call"" is mostly just another predictable (you can foresee what's going to happen with your eyes closed) and generic thriller with its only unique moments resting in a certain scalp sniffing sequence.",2,A scalp sniffing joke,1363305600,"03 15, 2013",2013,3522,"['just', 'night', 'job', '911', 'operator', 'Jordan', 'Turner', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'phone', 'call', 'girl', 'who', 'home', 'alone', 'break-in', 'Thanks', 'Jordan', 'poor', 'decision', 'making', 'girl', 'eventually', 'kidnapped', 'body', 'up', 'shortly', 'thereafter', 'Six', 'months', 'later', 'Jordan', 'stepped', 'away', 'floor', 'taking', 'task', 'training', 'new', 'recruits', 'panicked', 'call', 'Jordan', 'taking', 'wheel', 'first', 'time', 'months', 'young', 'girl', 'been', 'abducted', 'Jordan', 'been', 'knighted', 'only', 'means', 'life', 'support', 'case', 'unravel', 'Jordan', 'think', 'two', 'cases', 'are', 'connected', 'determined', 'not', 'make', 'same', 'mistake', 'twice.With', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Down', 'being', 'released', 'last', 'week', 'expectations', 'were', ""n't"", 'very', 'high', 'Call', 'films', 'are', 'being', 'released', 'WWE', 'Studios', 'Call', 'nearly', 'powers', 'lowered', 'expectations', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'what', 'like', 'real', '911', 'calls', 'calls', 'eventually', 'shift', 'being', 'tragic', 'slightly', 'violent', 'pretty', 'humorous', 'shot', 'wife', 'Yeah', 'lying', 'floor', 'uncle', 'stabbed', 'mom', 'leg', 'pretty', 'pissed', 'off', 'witness', 'how', 'slow', 'Jordan', 'job', 'can', 'be', 'how', 'off', 'guard', 'urgent', 'phone', 'call', 'can', 'catch', 'someone', 'slow', 'burn', 'what', 'come', 'Once', 'Leah', 'Templeton', 'Evie', 'Thompson', 'abducted', 'when', 'suspense', 'crashes', 'like', 'tsunami', 'wave', 'so', 'much', 'tension', 'film', 'thick', 'tense', 'atmosphere', 'what', 'film', 'seem', 'decent', 'first', 'half', 'then', 'everything', 'just', 'screeching', 'halt.Jordan', 'guard', 'way', 'down', 'boyfriend', 'Officer', 'Paul', 'Phillips', 'Morris', 'Chestnut', 'share', 'nice', 'little', 'canoodling', 'moment', 'Thinking', 'what', 'was', 'come', 'later', 'night', 'slow', 'night', 'work', 'had', 'had', 'up', 'point', 'caused', 'react', 'poorly', 'cost', 'Leah', 'life', 'smart', 'compared', 'what', 'other', 'people', 'do', 'film', 'are', 'dumbest', 'individuals', 'ever', 'grace', 'streets', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'caught', 'guy', 'red-handed', 'kidnapped', 'girl', 'back', 'seat', 'would', 'honestly', 'try', 'make', 'point', 'freaking', 'box', 'cutter', 'Everybody', 'watches', 'listens', 'Jordan', 'call', 'current', 'abducted', 'girl', 'Casey', 'Welson', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'Earlier', 'film', 'Jordan', 'point', 'say', 'Hive', 'what', 'city', 'running', 'why', 'security', 'so', 'tight', 'nobody', 'else', 'had', 'emergency', 'take', 'was', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'first', 'time', 'seeing', 'Michael', 'Eklund', 'anything', 'do', ""n't"", 'write', 'off', 'just', 'yet', 'pretty', 'talented', 'actor', 'always', 'fantastic', 'job', 'portraying', 'jarring', 'characters', 'not', 'many', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'well', 'Do', 'favor', 'watch', 'Xavier', 'Gens', 'Divide', 'meantime', 'Eklund', 'Michael', 'Foster', 'man', 'responsible', 'current', 'kidnappings', 'abductions', 'body', 'language', 'reactions', 'are', 'incredible', 'dialogue', 'really', 'flat', 'least', 'tried', 'do', 'best', 'could', 'what', 'had', 'Call', 'logic', 'window', 'finale', 'actually', 'everything', 'out', 'window', 'scratch', 'final', 'moments', 'characters', 'take', 'things', 'own', 'hands', 'hint', 'Saw', 'conclusion', 'Call', 'mostly', 'just', 'predictable', 'can', 'foresee', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'eyes', 'closed', 'generic', 'thriller', 'only', 'unique', 'moments', 'resting', 'certain', 'scalp', 'sniffing', 'sequence']",N/A

Despite a few small, far from ruinous plotholes, the first hour or so of THE CALL is immediately gripping, detailed, well-filmed, and well-acted. Halle Berry gives a typically fine performance as veteran 911 operator Jordan Turner.This film is also very revealing of what it's like to be a 911 operator in a city like Los Angeles. Not knowing much about it, I always assumed that this job was tense, sometimes nerve-wracking, but also fairly cut-and-dry: Emergency calls come in from people who are often hysterical and incoherent, the operators dispatch the proper emergency services, and then their job is done. THE CALL effectively shows how Turner's occupation compels her to stay on the line and give detailed, innovative advice to people, and how every little thing she says or does could make the difference between life and death. Finally, it shows how the actions of well-meaning bystanders can often tragically screw things up for both victims and police.SEMI-SPOILER ALERT: I'm sorry to say that things degenerate a bit toward the end: The unlikelihoods are a little more glaring here than they were at the start, and we encounter several tired old suspense film tropes. It seems THE CALL's creators were a little ambivalent on how to end it (a common dilemma). The very, very end is particularly dissatisfying, unbelievable, and completely out of character for Turner. Another thing: The bad guy here is a bit of a clich&eacute;d, ostensibly normal fellow that no one who knew ever suspected of being such a sicko. His apparent motivation, revealed in the weak ending, is also a little hard to buy.Yet, all things considered, good show!

A film produced by WWE Films is probably about as good as you would expect from the wrestling franchise. Additionally, Halle Berry's star has not shone brightly over the last few years. It seemed that The Call would be yet another miscalculation on her part.As the movie began, however, I was surprised to find myself completely engaged. The story follows Berry's character, a 911 operator who is having trouble leaving her emotions out of her work. She blames herself for the death of a girl she was on call with. Emotionally damaged, she is reassigned from the active field to a training position.She is thrust back into the work when one of her trainees receives a call from a kidnapped teenage girl, played by Abigail Breslin. Using her skills, she desperately tries to help the girl escape from the kidnapper, while struggling to keep her emotions from getting the best of her.There are many reasons why this movie shouldn't work. The story itself seems rather contrived. What are the odds that Berry's character would be thrust into this situation after he emotional breakdown . . . especially in the huge center that handles the Los Angeles calls? The style of the film, from dialogue all the way to costume and technology seems more suited to the action films of the late 90's. Despite all of this, I couldn't help but be sucked in to the exciting story that unfolded on the screen. The middle section, in particular, really works well. The back and forth, over the phone, between Berry and Breslin is pretty convincing. Towards the end of the movie, the story becomes very unbelievable, but if you've watched up to that point, you probably won't mind.

It may or may not have a wrestler in  but I must own it. Well WWE had a little hit with this film right here starring Halle Berry. This was considered a surprise hit even though to me it should have been anyway. The story is very interesting and the actors involved are top notch plus the filmmakers here excellent.Jordan is a 9-1-1 operator who may be the best at what she does, that is until she gets a call from a girl who is reporting that someone has broken into her house. She tells the girl to hide upstairs and all is going well until the call is disconnected. Jordan in a lapse of judgment calls her back revealing where she is hiding. The killer gets on the phone and tells Jordan &#8220;it's already done&#8221;. When the girl&#8217;s body is found Jordan cannot handle it and quits taking field calls. Now a teacher she is taking her students through the room where all the calls are handled when a call comes in from a girl saying she has been kidnapped and is in the trunk of a car. Circumstances force Jordan to take the call as she and this girl are in for more than either of them can imagine.This is one of the best films that WWE has produced without a doubt. Halle Berry and Abigail Breslin are excellent and make you feel every emotion that they are going through. The terror and tension builds and these two deliver perfectly. Michael Eklund is excellent here as well as the killer and Morris Chestnut & David Otunga are great as the cops. Otunga is the WWE wrestler that was assigned to this film and it was a good choice as he seems very natural at it.This was a very good flick that had some legit tension in it, my Aunt and Grandmother [who love these types of flicks] said it drove them crazy. I recommended it to them knowing they would love it. Now the first third of this movie seemed like a different type of flick then what the ending would suggest. I don&#8217;t want to ruin anything but this flick takes a cool turn. Also I had a feeling going in I would enjoy this movie since the director is the same guy that made &#8220;The Machinist&#8221; with Christian Bale and one of my all time favorite movies &#8220;Session 9. So with Brad Anderson at the helm I had a feeling it would be good.The Blu-Ray comes with a very informative commentary track featuring almost everyone involved on both sides of the camera really.

Written by Richard D'Ovidio, Nicole D'Ovidio and Jon Bokenkamp and tightly directed by Brad Anderson This film is a top-notch scary movie - one that touches on many strange anomalies of people and how important the 911 system of assistance to those in need can be.Jordan Turner (Halle Berry) is an experienced Los Angeles 911 operator but when she makes an error in judgment and a call form a young girl Leah (Evie Thompson) ends badly, Jordan is rattled and unsure if she can continue. But then teenager Casey Welson (Abigail Breslin) is abducted in the back trunk of a car belonging to Michael Foster ( Canadian actor Michael Eklund) and calls 911. And Jordan pauses her teaching assignment to potential 911 callers and is the one called upon to use all of her experience, insights and quick thinking to help Casey escape, and not just to save Casey, but also to make sure the man is brought to justice. The crew in the 911 call center includes actors Roma Maffia, Denise Dowse, and police officers Morris Chestnut and David Otunga and there is a significant guest appearance by Michael Imperioli.Some of the response systems from the LAPD seem broken and that delays the motion of the chase to find the missing Casey, but the performances of the main characters more than make up for the slips in the script.

That call center is one of the two interesting things we see in this dreadful R-rated movie. The second is an aerial view of a major Los Angeles freeway intersection. Both of these are jaw-dropping.Unfortunately for me, after these two interesting bits, there is an entire movie to sit through, punctuated by hysterical women, women in jeopardy, women being stripped, women being drugged, women under duress, women being tortured, women being scalped, pieces of women, corpses of women and other horrific scenes.The last third of the movie is based on an absurd assumption that a 911 operator (a woman) would make a solo trip to a wooded area in the L.A. vicinity in the middle of the night and stumble upon a well-concealed chamber of horrors maintained by a serial killer. I found myself muttering, ""Oh, Come ONNN!"" Brace yourself for at least 20 full minutes of ""DON'T GO IN THE BASEMENT!""-type suspense and horror.We see:* Halle Berry (""Cloud Atlas"") gorgeous as ever, portrays that laughably intuitive 911 operator, traumatized by her failure to save an earlier victim of that same sadistic serial killer.* Abigail Breslin (""Rango"") is the second victim of that notorious killer. She was born a Capricorn though, which means she is a fighter.* Morris Chestnut (""Identity Thief"") is a frustrated LA cop, trying desperately to locate that car carrying a kidnapping (and potential murder) victim in the trunk. His character and Berry's just happen to be in relationship.* David Otunga (Lots of TV) is another one of L.A.'s finest, frantically trying to gather enough clues to discover where that poor doomed girl might be.* Michael Eklund (Lots of TV) is chilling as the first Norman Bates in this year's roster of horror films.* Michael Imperioli (""The Lovely Bones"") is wonderful as the sharp-eyed motorist who spots something wrong with that vehicle which (we know) has a kidnapping victim in the trunk.This is an excellent primer on what an abducted person should do if locked in an automobile trunk: Break out a tail-light and wave your arm: dump stuff (in this case, paint) out through that same hole; do anything to attract attention. We are reminded how important it is for average citizens to take the initiative and report things that ""just don't look right.""I am NOT a big fan of suspense movies, but the folks who like these type films were highly entertained.

The whole chase, the whole 911 call, the whole cat and mouse trick with the police... the suspense was good although there were moments (a common trend in these kinds of films) where you wished you could have slapped someone in the face because of their stupidity. But the second part, where Hale Berry makes a Clint Eastwood out of herself and do something that no one would ever do in their right mind, well that second part is where this movie loses its credibility.  A good first part but a second one that makes you hate Hollywood with a vengeance. They had a great subject. Almost no movies, If none whatsoever, have been done about the people behind the 911 team. It would have been so much more interesting to stay with them all the way through and see how they compose with all that stress. It would have been so much more fun to see the police finally put their hands on the bad guy, all because of their intelligent and courageous work. But no. That damn Hollywood had to destroy everything by turning this good suspense into an insipid cheap horror flick that we've seen a hundred times.

1628609,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B00BEIYIF0,J. Richardson,"[2, 2]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.I knew going in that The Call wasn't going to be the greatest movie ever created. I also knew that, if anything, I would get a nice, intense experience and that would be the end of it. Well, I was right. The Call is one of those films that keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time, but it doesn't necessarily do anything new or inventive. It follows the same formulas we've seen from other films in this genre, which, unfortunately, allows it to feel somewhat predictable around 30 minutes in. Still, the idea was creative and it's coupled with some exceptional acting from Halle Berry and Abigail Breslin.You follow Jordan Turner (Berry), a 9-1-1 operator. After receiving a bad call that resulted in the death of a teenage girl, Jordan finds that the pressure of her job is starting to get to her. Six months pass and she becomes a trainer for the incoming operators. However, when a young girl named Casey (Breslin) calls and says she's been kidnapped, Jordan is put on the phone. It doesn't take long before we find out that the man behind this kidnapping is the same man behind the murder six months ago. Once Jordan learns this she makes it her responsibility to catch this man and save this young girl.From start to finish The Call is an intense, non-stop thrill ride. There's very little room to breath and I think that's what they were going for. Normally I would find this to be an annoyance, but it fits given the genre. However, what I can't excuse is sacrificing pacing for intensity, which is exactly what The Call does. Majority of the film has solid pacing and nothing feels rushed, but the final 30 minutes or so is where everything kind of falls apart. This is where all the cliches are thrown in and this is where the pacing goes out the window. They took everything that The Call did right up to this point and turned it on its head. Not only that, but the conclusion is probably the most anticlimactic ending I've seen all year.Surprisingly, the best part of the movie was when we were on the road with Michael Foster (Michael Eklund) in the front and Casey in the trunk. This is where the more inventive side of the movie comes into play. You have the calm, but emotionally attached Jordan talking on the phone while the distressed and frightened Casey tries to cooperate with her instructions. To be completely honest, I was expecting this part of the movie to be a train-wreck, but it was all done quite nicely. It's not completely perfect, however. Some of the camera angles were a bit wonky and they jumped frames too much, but these minor annoyances are nothing when compared to the generic nature of the film's final half hour.Finally, I thought the casting was excellent. Halle Berry, while looking unhealthy levels of skinny, did a fantastic job as Jordan; portraying an individual who may not be cut out for her job anymore, but is forced into this position even after she changes her job title. Abigail Breslin was equally enjoyable, finding that perfect balance of fear and will to live. Along with them you have Morris Chestnut who plays Jordan's love interest, Officer Paul Phillips. While not a huge character in the plot, it's always a joy to see Chestnut on screen. Then there's Michael Elkund. While I thought Michael's story was a bit cliched, Elkund did a good job of bringing the character to life.Overall Score: 7/10 - The Call is one of those films that knows where it wants to go and what it wants to do. It's confident and it has drive, but it suffers from a weak third act. It starts off very strong and it may keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time, but the closing minutes are filled with cliches and wrong turns and it winds up bringing down the experience. If you're looking for for a good thriller then look no further, but I would suggest you make this one a rental.",4,7/10 - It's ok,1373241600,"07 8, 2013",2013,3889,"['Note', 'May', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'Proceed', 'caution.I', 'knew', 'going', 'Call', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'greatest', 'movie', 'ever', 'created', 'also', 'knew', 'anything', 'would', 'get', 'nice', 'intense', 'experience', 'would', 'be', 'end', 'Well', 'was', 'right', 'Call', 'one', 'films', 'keeps', 'edge', 'seat', 'entire', 'time', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'do', 'anything', 'new', 'inventive', 'same', 'formulas', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'films', 'genre', 'unfortunately', 'feel', 'somewhat', 'predictable', '30', 'minutes', 'Still', 'idea', 'was', 'creative', 'coupled', 'exceptional', 'acting', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'Abigail', 'Breslin.You', 'follow', 'Jordan', 'Turner', 'Berry', '9-1-1', 'operator', 'receiving', 'bad', 'call', 'resulted', 'death', 'teenage', 'girl', 'Jordan', 'pressure', 'job', 'starting', 'get', 'Six', 'months', 'pass', 'trainer', 'incoming', 'operators', 'However', 'when', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Casey', 'Breslin', 'calls', 'been', 'kidnapped', 'Jordan', 'put', 'phone', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'find', 'out', 'man', 'kidnapping', 'same', 'man', 'murder', 'six', 'months', 'ago', 'Once', 'Jordan', 'responsibility', 'catch', 'man', 'save', 'young', 'girl.From', 'start', 'finish', 'Call', 'intense', 'non-stop', 'thrill', 'ride', 'very', 'little', 'room', 'breath', 'think', 'what', 'were', 'going', 'Normally', 'would', 'find', 'be', 'annoyance', 'given', 'genre', 'However', 'what', 'ca', ""n't"", 'excuse', 'sacrificing', 'pacing', 'intensity', 'exactly', 'what', 'Call', 'Majority', 'film', 'solid', 'pacing', 'nothing', 'feels', 'rushed', 'final', '30', 'minutes', 'so', 'where', 'everything', 'kind', 'falls', 'apart', 'where', 'cliches', 'are', 'thrown', 'where', 'pacing', 'out', 'window', 'took', 'everything', 'Call', 'did', 'right', 'up', 'point', 'turned', 'head', 'Not', 'only', 'conclusion', 'probably', 'most', 'anticlimactic', 'ending', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year.Surprisingly', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'when', 'were', 'road', 'Michael', 'Foster', 'Michael', 'Eklund', 'front', 'Casey', 'trunk', 'where', 'more', 'inventive', 'side', 'movie', 'play', 'have', 'calm', 'emotionally', 'attached', 'Jordan', 'talking', 'phone', 'distressed', 'frightened', 'Casey', 'tries', 'cooperate', 'instructions', 'be', 'completely', 'honest', 'was', 'expecting', 'part', 'movie', 'be', 'train-wreck', 'was', 'done', 'quite', 'nicely', 'not', 'completely', 'perfect', 'however', 'camera', 'angles', 'were', 'bit', 'wonky', 'jumped', 'frames', 'too', 'much', 'minor', 'annoyances', 'are', 'nothing', 'when', 'compared', 'generic', 'nature', 'film', 'final', 'half', 'hour.Finally', 'thought', 'casting', 'was', 'excellent', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'looking', 'unhealthy', 'levels', 'skinny', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'Jordan', 'portraying', 'individual', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'cut', 'out', 'job', 'anymore', 'forced', 'position', 'even', 'job', 'title', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'was', 'equally', 'enjoyable', 'finding', 'perfect', 'balance', 'fear', 'will', 'live', 'have', 'Morris', 'Chestnut', 'who', 'Jordan', 'love', 'interest', 'Officer', 'Paul', 'Phillips', 'not', 'huge', 'character', 'plot', 'always', 'joy', 'see', 'Chestnut', 'screen', 'Then', 'Michael', 'Elkund', 'thought', 'Michael', 'story', 'was', 'bit', 'cliched', 'Elkund', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'bringing', 'character', 'life.Overall', 'Score', '7/10', 'Call', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'go', 'what', 'do', 'confident', 'drive', 'weak', 'third', 'act', 'very', 'strong', 'may', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', 'entire', 'time', 'closing', 'minutes', 'are', 'filled', 'cliches', 'wrong', 'turns', 'up', 'bringing', 'down', 'experience', ""'re"", 'looking', 'good', 'thriller', 'then', 'look', 'further', 'would', 'suggest', 'make', 'one', 'rental']",N/A

She tracks him down to a underground lab not too far from where the police raided a cabin they thought he was in. She opens the door leading to the underground lab and drops her cell phone, it of course falls into the cavern.She climbs down and gets her phone...Now instead of climbing back up the ladder to get a signal to call the police she goes after the abductor....Meanwhile the girl is strapped to a table and and the lunatic is using a scalpal to cut her scalp off, he digs deep into her temple and by the time he gets to mid center (at this time she is heavily bleeding fro the deep gash)(of course Halle doesnt know she is strapped to a table because the little girl is not screaming) guess what...Halle (911 operator) jumps him...A chase ensues and finally Halle and the girl knocks him out...When the abuctor awakes he finds himself tied up...the little girls scalp is by some miracle not bleeding and doesnt look so bad (amazing) what happens next makes even less sense....the both of them leave him tied up and close the door to let him I guess starve to death...One has to think how in the world can a level headed, law abiding 911 operator resort to murder...How come she loses all common sense aftershe finds the underground cavern....Then on top of that, not inform the police of his location and to leave him to die.This movie as impossible as it sounds goes from a all time great to a complete disaster in 30 mins time.Here is a thought, During the movie Halle told the little girl on the phone while she was locked in a trunk of a car that she has to fight to stay alive and she would take her to a movie when all this is over. The ending could have been MUCH more believable. THe whole ending needed to be changed,  The police could have arrived, took the abuctor into custady and the last scene could have been in a movie theater showing the two watching a movie.

Cell phones that can't be traced, the psycho killing one person after another, and the 911 operator actually going out to track down the murderer.  Come on.

Even though Halle Berry is certainly easy on the eyes, her track record in the movies has been spotty and I was having a hard time seeing her as a 911 operator.  Not to mention the fact that the premise seemed familiar.  So why not wait for the home video.  So here it is.  And I was wrong.  Well, sort of.Berry takes off the makeup and plays Jordan Turner a fairly recent recruit in the L. A. 911 center.  She's good at her job but then gets a call from a terrified teenage girl.  Unfortunately it doesn't go well and Jordan blames herself.  She's despondent and is placed on duty as a trainer.  When another call comes in while walking a group of rookies through the center, Jordan takes over as a new agent is flummoxed.  Yes, it's another teen in distress played by Abigail Breslin (yes, the little girl from ""Little Miss Sunshine"").  She has been kidnapped from a parking garage at a large mall.Jordan, still blaming herself for the earlier misfortune manages to get back on the case as Casey manages to call 911 using a throw away phone her friend had given her.  Psycho kidnapper Michael (Michael Eklund) had confiscated her regular phone.  Since this is an unregistered phone, pinpointing Casey's location, other than she's in the trunk of a moving car, is problematic.  Using ingenuity and her training, Jordan and Casey put out some signals that hopefully will allow the police, now in full scramble mode, to home in on the pervert.  For most of the film, this cat and mouse game plays very well and should raise the hair on your arm.  Frankly, I was surprised and impressed.  Hey, this is a really good flick.After a solid lead doesn't pan out, Jordan sitting alone in a nearly empty center decides she wants to go out and take a look for herself.  Yep, here we go.  If the original plot points seem a little unlikely, at least they were exciting.  Now we are moving into stupidity.  Hell, even Jordan's boyfriend is a cop (Morris Chestnut), but she goes out alone...at night...armed with a flashlight!  You can pretty much guess the rest as we have now fallen into the stage of predictability.  I will admit however that even in this final act, the tension is high.

1628723,A1K6K23WG0IBWE,B00BEIYIF0,Quadro Sinead Summer,"[3, 5]","Well there isn't a great deal I can say about this thriller in the area of any outstanding praise. It's simply not a truly great movie. All the familiar elements are there, and even some new twists are still not enough to get this movie sailing. Nothing here that is particularly groundbreaking. Halle Berry is a great actress and I'm sure she was persuaded by what seemed like a great character to play when she was considering the script. Depending on production values and a tactful director this could have been the next Silence of the Lambs. But maybe that's giving the film an unfair comparison. It's not really anywhere in the territory of such a classic serial killer movie. Be that as it may, it's clear from beginning to end were watching a slightly above average kidnapping thriller. Berry, if she realized this during production she didn't care, because she truly turns in a more that reasonable performance. She's good in this, but she's not the problem. More about that in a bit..The key importance of this film is the situation Berry's character finds her self in, a 911 operator dealing with the day to day ever so real horrors that go on in the world, an audible bystander who has to hear first hand every minor detail during terrible events. Hearing, but never seeing them, or for that matter once the police take over never knowing what the final outcome was.  The film does well telling their story, the story of 911 assistance operators. When every second counts and what the operator does to help the person on the other end of the line can mean the difference between life or death.  It's an unpleasant job, but someone has to do it, right? The film explores pretty new territory in the motion picture industry. For the first time we've got an indepth look at what it is really like to work as an emergency assistance operator. This is what the film really does well, and it does show this world convincingly and often with very interesting results.What is not as interesting or all that unique, or even at times poorly executed is much of the rest of the story. An innocent girl kidnapped and trapped in the trunk of a car. A calculating and cunning predator who has done it before. he should be a careful predator. But he's not really. and maybe he's perhaps not very smart. In fact he's downright stupid. It takes him a great deal of time to realize the girl he just kidnapped in the trunk of the car he's driving  has a cell phone and is conversing with a 911 operator. events proceed in such a way that anyone with any brains would have begun to wonder long before he does. He never checks any pockets of his victim to see what she's carrying even when he has several opportunities to do so? The kidnapped girl get's away with a great deal before he discovers what she's doing.Now we've all heard the stories of dumb criminals doing dumb things, so I suppose it's possible he never thought she'd have a cellphone. In this day an age however it's commonly known that kids and texting almost always go hand in hand. But let's not check to see if she has a smartphone This guy is dumb for a lot of reasons. I mean who kidnaps someone and throws them in a trunk without securing their victim, hands tied behind their back anyway?, much less leave them in there with large 2 cans of white paint and a big shovel? Yes this serial killer is pretty clueless. A little too clueless. And he's a pro at this presumably? He's done it before who knows how many times. The film suggests- perhaps many. I just didn't buy it all together.Another thing I thought didn't make much sense was more a casting issue. Michael Imperioli, who played Tony Soprano's nephew, Christopher Moltisanti in The Sopranos, is a truly gifted actor, and here he is totally miscast and horribly underused in a very small role as a bystander that thinks something is wrong and does what he can to try and help the kidnapped girl in the trunk. I found it really weird to see him in this part. It does not fit him at all, and it's absolutely one of the worst cases of miscasting I've seen in a major motion picture in a long time. An actor of his ability with his very impressive resume deserves much better than this. On top of it, he simply doesn't work in the role. it's just a totally off the wall casting call.The serial killer here is interesting enough, but as menacing maniacs go he's pretty bland. I think they forgot to consider that the public has seen so many villains in similar roles that you've really got to work and think things through and come up with someone really unique and scary enough to make a dent. This guy is no Norman Bates or Hannibal Lecter, that's for sure. He's not someone that stands out as a truly creepy villian most of us have been used to seeing in these sorts of roles.The Call is far from being another flop, and though it does tell the story of the day to day routine of 911 operators quite brilliantly, and it does have a few interesting moments that can qualify it as a reasonable thriller, at least to me by the end of the film I thought ""yea, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything I would care to even remember when I wake up tomorrow"".

1628724,A3VHUQ85RH0BC3,B00BEIYIF0,"Raj ""rajivsreviews""","[6, 9]","Synopsis:The story revolves around Jordan Turner (Halle Berry) a LAPD 911 operator, who receives a call from a girl named Leah, telling her that someone has broken into her home and is going to kill her. Jordan comes up with a plan to help save Leah, but the plan backfires when the call is disconnected, and Jordan calls back to check if Leah is okay. The intruder finds out that Leah is in the house (when she answers Jordan's call) and kills her. Jordan is traumatized by the event and is put as a trainer for new 911 operators.Six months after the incident, while Jordan is showing the new operators around the facility, Brooke, a rookie operator, gets a distress call and unable to handle it, hands it to Jordan. Jordan takes the call from Casey Welson (Abigail Breslin), a girl who has been kidnapped, and finds out that the kidnapper is the same person who murdered Leah. The killer has put Casey in the trunk of his car, and Jordan tries to help Casey by determining her location, but is unable to do so because Casey is using a disposable phone. Can Jordan save Casey before the killer attacks again?ReviewAs a fan of Halle Berry, I was dying to see ""The Call"" hoping that it would meet my expectations. Did it? Unfortunately..no! The movie starts off really well when Casey is abducted and keeps talking with Jordan to help her track their location. I was at the edge of my seat during the whole `car chase' scene, and the scene where Michael (the killer) realizes what Casey is up to and kills Alan (a suspecting passerby). While most of the movie has a eerie realistic feel to it, the scenario changes when Halle Berry goes from a diligent operator to a detective / action chick who decides to track the killer herself. The worst part was the climax. While I am not going to give away the ending to those who have not yet seen the movie, I would say that I was extremely disappointed as to how they decide to get revenge on the killer, and how open-ended it leaves the story. I'm guessing they left it that way in hopes of a sequel, but nevertheless, it was frustrating.Even though the plot falls flat towards the end, the entire cast did a wonderful job in the roles. Halle Berry, Abigail Breslin,  Michael Eklund and Michael Imperioli gave a solid performance in their respective roles, especially Michael Eklund as the psycho.Overall, ""The Call"" is one of those movies which builds up the suspense in a great way through most of its run, but falls short in the last 15-20 minutes. If you are a fan of Halle Berry or Abigail Breslin, then you should definately watch ""The Call"" for their performances.",3,"Builds up the suspense in a great way through most of its run, but falls short in the last 15-20 minutes",1367020800,"04 27, 2013",2013,2615,"['Synopsis', 'story', 'around', 'Jordan', 'Turner', 'Halle', 'Berry', '911', 'operator', 'who', 'call', 'girl', 'named', 'Leah', 'telling', 'someone', 'broken', 'home', 'going', 'kill', 'Jordan', 'up', 'plan', 'help', 'save', 'Leah', 'plan', 'when', 'call', 'disconnected', 'Jordan', 'back', 'check', 'Leah', 'okay', 'intruder', 'out', 'Leah', 'house', 'when', 'Jordan', 'call', 'Jordan', 'traumatized', 'event', 'put', 'trainer', 'new', '911', 'operators.Six', 'months', 'incident', 'Jordan', 'showing', 'new', 'operators', 'facility', 'Brooke', 'rookie', 'operator', 'distress', 'call', 'unable', 'handle', 'Jordan', 'Jordan', 'call', 'Casey', 'Welson', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'girl', 'who', 'been', 'kidnapped', 'out', 'kidnapper', 'same', 'person', 'who', 'murdered', 'Leah', 'killer', 'put', 'Casey', 'trunk', 'car', 'Jordan', 'tries', 'help', 'Casey', 'determining', 'location', 'unable', 'do', 'so', 'Casey', 'using', 'disposable', 'phone', 'Can', 'Jordan', 'save', 'Casey', 'killer', 'attacks', 'again', 'ReviewAs', 'fan', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'was', 'dying', 'see', 'Call', 'hoping', 'would', 'meet', 'expectations', 'Did', 'Unfortunately..no', 'movie', 'really', 'well', 'when', 'Casey', 'abducted', 'talking', 'Jordan', 'help', 'track', 'location', 'was', 'edge', 'seat', 'whole', 'car', 'chase', 'scene', 'scene', 'where', 'Michael', 'killer', 'what', 'Casey', 'kills', 'Alan', 'suspecting', 'passerby', 'most', 'movie', 'eerie', 'realistic', 'feel', 'scenario', 'changes', 'when', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'diligent', 'operator', 'detective', '/', 'action', 'chick', 'who', 'track', 'killer', 'worst', 'part', 'was', 'climax', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'seen', 'movie', 'would', 'say', 'was', 'extremely', 'disappointed', 'how', 'decide', 'get', 'revenge', 'killer', 'how', 'open-ended', 'story', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'left', 'way', 'hopes', 'sequel', 'nevertheless', 'was', 'frustrating.Even', 'plot', 'flat', 'end', 'entire', 'cast', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'roles', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'Michael', 'Eklund', 'Michael', 'Imperioli', 'gave', 'solid', 'performance', 'respective', 'roles', 'especially', 'Michael', 'Eklund', 'psycho.Overall', 'Call', 'one', 'movies', 'suspense', 'great', 'way', 'most', 'run', 'short', 'last', '15-20', 'minutes', 'are', 'fan', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'then', 'should', 'definately', 'watch', 'Call', 'performances']",N/A

Halle Berry plays the Southern California 911 dispatcher who's in a race against the clock to rescue a teenage girl (Abigail Breslin) locked in the trunk of a serial killer (Michael Eklund).Director Brad Anderson keeps the action going at a breakneck pace, providing pulse-pounding, edge-of-the-seat suspense that  helps us to overlook the stray inconsistency and implausibility that wander into the narrative, particularly towards the end (the movie doesn't entirely escape the Third Act curse common to the genre). There's also an unfortunate tendency towards the sadistic that spoils some of the fun.The really distinctive feature is that writer Richard D'Ovidio has made Jordan, the dispatcher, a compelling, easily identifiable figure by emphasizing not only her strength and craftiness but her insecurity and self-doubt as she does her best to assist people in making it through sometimes unimaginable crises.The movie is a bit overwrought at times (again, looking at you, last half hour) and it ultimately succumbs to too many serial-killer cliches, but ""The Call"" is a whole lot better than many of the more highly publicized, big-budget thrillers of recent times.",3,Engrossing thriller despite a weak third act,1382486400,"10 23, 2013",2013,1262,"['***1/2', 'Call', 'tidy', 'little', 'thriller', 'modeled', 'large', 'part', 'movie', 'Speed', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'Southern', 'California', '911', 'dispatcher', 'who', 'race', 'clock', 'rescue', 'teenage', 'girl', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'locked', 'trunk', 'serial', 'killer', 'Michael', 'Eklund', '.Director', 'Brad', 'Anderson', 'action', 'going', 'breakneck', 'pace', 'providing', 'pulse-pounding', 'edge-of-the-seat', 'suspense', 'overlook', 'stray', 'inconsistency', 'implausibility', 'wander', 'narrative', 'particularly', 'end', 'movie', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'escape', 'Third', 'Act', 'curse', 'common', 'genre', 'also', 'unfortunate', 'tendency', 'sadistic', 'fun.The', 'really', 'distinctive', 'feature', 'writer', 'Richard', ""D'Ovidio"", 'made', 'Jordan', 'dispatcher', 'compelling', 'easily', 'identifiable', 'figure', 'emphasizing', 'not', 'only', 'strength', 'craftiness', 'insecurity', 'self-doubt', 'best', 'assist', 'people', 'making', 'sometimes', 'unimaginable', 'crises.The', 'movie', 'bit', 'overwrought', 'times', 'again', 'looking', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'ultimately', 'succumbs', 'too', 'many', 'serial-killer', 'cliches', 'Call', 'whole', 'lot', 'better', 'many', 'more', 'highly', 'publicized', 'big-budget', 'thrillers', 'recent', 'times']",N/A

1628773,A2I7NGKA8LPN89,B00BEIYIF0,Stacy Hackney (formerly customerS),"[1, 1]","I'm a big Halle Berry fan and usually check out whatever she's in. This movie was okay. The acting was good. I had two problems with the story: (1) unbelievable that the Halle Berry character, as a 911 operator, would go on the hunt for a serial killer.  If the story wanted to convince me that she would do such a thing, then the character needed to have been established at some point earlier in the story performing a physically highly risky behavior.  Ms. Berry convinced me that her character would have wanted to save the young victim (who was very well played by the young actress by the way), but the story itself needed to have her do something heroic and/or life-endangering before she left the 911 call center and hit the streets. And what kind of imbecile character goes on the hunt for a serial killer without a weapon? Too dumb. Reminds me of the idiot characters in teenage slasher films (and I truly dislike dumb characters, especially dumb female characters, which are so opposite of female intellect in real life); and (2) unbelievable that the Halle Berry character would have left the villain in the hole. Really no reason for her to have done that. The villain murdered one man right in front of the young victim and she survived and would have been able to testify. The victim also was kidnapped herself; she also witnessed the villain murdering another man at the gas station. No way the villain would have escaped prison and very likely would have received the death penalty.  To basically kill him themselves without rule of law was unacceptable to me and as presented, the story made no case why the Halle Berry character would do such a thing. I actually disliked that part very much. Why would the story advocate no rule of law. Yes we know the villain is a mad dog and doesn't deserve freedom but who were these two citizens to decide they had the right to be judge and jury. Had they murdered him in their attempt to escape that would have been one thing, but to coldbloodedly decide to leave him there to starve to death didn't work for me and I disliked the heroines made a less than ethical choice, when they didn't have to. I find rule of law comforting, especially in difficult times, and disapproved of the characters making the choice they did. They became murderers in my opinion, when there was no reason to: they'd escaped and the villain was no longer a threat. They had time to call the authorities but decided to take the law into their own hands. Didn't care for that.  If the storyteller wanted the villain to be killed by his intended victim and her rescuer, then he should have been killed during their successful escape; that would've worked for me ethically. As presented, they became murdering villains themselves.  Certainly the man they murdered was not innocent, but by killing him in the way that they did, they victimized him, creating an inadvertent sympathy for him which was not to my taste, storywise.  Sort of reminds of me the original When A Stranger Calls. The madman was established as evil in Act 1 when he murdered two innocent sleeping children and in Act 2 we see him victimized (when he was beaten up at the bar and was homeless and destitute and ill) and this victimization dilutes the fear factor established so well in Act 1. Same in The Call. Starving to death in a hole by yourself is a horrible way to die; the audience knows it and the inadvertent sympathy dilutes the villains villainy and while it doesn't put the heroines's villainy on par with the villain's evil, it needlessly dirties they hands: poor story choice.",2,it was okay (SPOILERS)...,1380326400,"09 28, 2013",2013,3596,"[""'m"", 'big', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'fan', 'usually', 'check', 'out', 'movie', 'was', 'okay', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'had', 'two', 'problems', 'story', '1', 'unbelievable', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'character', '911', 'operator', 'would', 'go', 'hunt', 'serial', 'killer', 'story', 'wanted', 'convince', 'would', 'do', 'thing', 'then', 'character', 'needed', 'have', 'been', 'established', 'point', 'earlier', 'story', 'performing', 'physically', 'highly', 'risky', 'behavior', 'Ms.', 'Berry', 'convinced', 'character', 'would', 'have', 'wanted', 'save', 'young', 'victim', 'who', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'played', 'young', 'actress', 'way', 'story', 'needed', 'have', 'do', 'something', 'heroic', 'and/or', 'life-endangering', 'left', '911', 'call', 'center', 'hit', 'streets', 'what', 'kind', 'imbecile', 'character', 'hunt', 'serial', 'killer', 'weapon', 'Too', 'dumb', 'Reminds', 'idiot', 'characters', 'teenage', 'slasher', 'films', 'truly', 'dislike', 'dumb', 'characters', 'especially', 'dumb', 'female', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'opposite', 'female', 'intellect', 'real', 'life', '2', 'unbelievable', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'character', 'would', 'have', 'left', 'villain', 'hole', 'Really', 'reason', 'have', 'done', 'villain', 'murdered', 'one', 'man', 'right', 'front', 'young', 'victim', 'survived', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'testify', 'victim', 'also', 'was', 'kidnapped', 'also', 'witnessed', 'villain', 'murdering', 'man', 'gas', 'station', 'way', 'villain', 'would', 'have', 'escaped', 'prison', 'very', 'likely', 'would', 'have', 'received', 'death', 'penalty', 'basically', 'kill', 'rule', 'law', 'was', 'unacceptable', 'as', 'presented', 'story', 'made', 'case', 'why', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'character', 'would', 'do', 'thing', 'actually', 'disliked', 'part', 'very', 'much', 'Why', 'would', 'story', 'advocate', 'rule', 'law', 'Yes', 'know', 'villain', 'mad', 'dog', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'freedom', 'who', 'were', 'two', 'citizens', 'decide', 'had', 'right', 'be', 'judge', 'jury', 'Had', 'murdered', 'attempt', 'escape', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'thing', 'coldbloodedly', 'decide', 'leave', 'there', 'starve', 'death', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'disliked', 'heroines', 'made', 'less', 'ethical', 'choice', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'find', 'rule', 'law', 'comforting', 'especially', 'difficult', 'times', 'disapproved', 'characters', 'making', 'choice', 'did', 'became', 'murderers', 'opinion', 'when', 'was', 'reason', ""'d"", 'escaped', 'villain', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'threat', 'had', 'time', 'call', 'authorities', 'decided', 'take', 'law', 'own', 'hands', 'Did', ""n't"", 'care', 'storyteller', 'wanted', 'villain', 'be', 'killed', 'intended', 'victim', 'rescuer', 'then', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'killed', 'successful', 'escape', 'would', ""'ve"", 'worked', 'ethically', 'presented', 'became', 'murdering', 'villains', 'Certainly', 'man', 'murdered', 'was', 'not', 'innocent', 'killing', 'way', 'did', 'victimized', 'creating', 'inadvertent', 'sympathy', 'was', 'not', 'taste', 'storywise', 'Sort', 'reminds', 'original', 'When', 'A', 'Stranger', 'Calls', 'madman', 'was', 'established', 'evil', 'Act', '1', 'when', 'murdered', 'two', 'innocent', 'sleeping', 'children', 'Act', '2', 'see', 'victimized', 'when', 'was', 'beaten', 'up', 'bar', 'was', 'homeless', 'destitute', 'ill', 'victimization', 'fear', 'factor', 'established', 'so', 'well', 'Act', '1', 'Same', 'Call', 'Starving', 'death', 'hole', 'horrible', 'way', 'die', 'audience', 'inadvertent', 'sympathy', 'villains', 'villainy', ""n't"", 'put', 'heroines', 'villainy', 'par', 'villain', 'evil', 'needlessly', 'hands', 'poor', 'story', 'choice']",N/A

1628786,A2A2SUY3IOQKY1,B00BEIYIF0,TawnTawn,"[3, 4]","Halle Berry plays Jordan, a 911 operator in a huge call center. You overhear many disturbing calls. She also gets a lot of calls from some man who keeps getting arrested, saying he has done nothing. One girl calls as her house is being broken into and the connection is broken. Jordan stupidly calls her back and the intruder hears the ring and pulls the girl out from under the bed. Even I would know better than that.SPOILERSSo many stupid things about this movie.  Michael, the kidnapper/killer goes about his business of kidnapping and murdering and NO ONE ever sees him doing anything. Kidnap a girl in a huge parking garage but no one else is going to their car, getting out of their car, driving around looking for a space, nothing.  He can whack a guy in a parking lot but nobody is around and no one driving by notices. Stupid guy at a gas station pulls a knife on him while he's pumping gas and you just know he's going to shoot gas at the guy, then set him on fire with the previous guy's lighter.  In reality, the guy with the knife would have known that too.  And who keeps cans of paint in their trunk and the cans never move or roll around? He's a lowly medical technician yet has plenty of time off work, owns a house in the suburbs, has two kids and apparently his wife doesn't work. The actor playing Michael reminded me of that guy who said he killed Jon Benet Ramsey.The man Michael attacked in the parking lot, then threw into the trunk along with the girl victim, wakes up and freaks out. Okay, I can understand that. He's had a blow to the head and probably doesn't remember what happened. He has sense enough to pull out his lighter to see where he is, yet he ignores the girl begging him to be quiet, and doesn't even seem to notice her presence. He flips out much worse than the girl did when she was kidnapped.Michael has that weird sister fetish like the guy at the House at the End of the Street, and he even has an underground lair and bedroom set up like him. There is blood on the bedspread and wall, which seems out of place. In the commentary they say that it needed something to look scary and explain why Casey gets this look of horror on her face when she sees it. But it just seems stupid. Casey also has to get stripped down and run around in her blue bra, for no apparent reason. Michael apparently wants to get some blond hair to match his sister's.  He plays around with a blond wig/scalp thing and gets disgusted by some kind of blue thing stuck in it. He pulls out the blue thing and throws the wig in a little fridge. Then he goes to scalp Casey because if the hair doesn't have blood flow, then it dies. What? Hair is already dead. Again, in the commentary, someone makes fun of his statement...so why did they have him say it? Jordan has never learned from scary movies that when you hit the bad guy and he goes down, as soon as you turn your back, he's up again to attack you. Everybody knows that.I think the ending could have been more satisfying than the ambiguous one it had.  The acting was adequate.  In the commentary, they refer to ""when you see the deleted scenes,"" however the DVD does not have the deleted scenes. Why the discrimination?

1628801,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B00BEIYIF0,Todd Smith,"[0, 0]","When it was announced that WWE was staring a film company, like most, I thought it was a joke. After some success with films like the Marine and 12 Rounds, the company earned some legitimacy and with it comes bigger talent and better Directors. The Call is the first WWE film that doesn't star a wrestler, and it was every bit as good as any Hollywood thriller that was released last year. Halle Berry stars as a 911 operator, whose worse nightmare is realized, when a kidnapping victim calls in from the trunk of a serial killers car. From there, the Call becomes 90 minutes of pure, non-stop intensity. It's hard to imagine a film that features a girl in a trunk and a woman in a call center, being as entertaining as it was, but that's where the experienced Hollywood talent comes into play. Halle Berry is not someone I consider to be a terrific actress, but she surprised me, by playing a character who had to overcome emotion and think on her feet. It quickly becomes evident that going by the book will lead to this girls death, and the operator comes up with some pretty novel ideas about how to deal with the situation. The supporting cast, which does feature an active WWE superstar, is also very good in assisting with the statewide manhunt. This film was really on pace to be one of my favorite films of the year until the ending. It was very strange, but the film gets to a certain point and then just ends. There may not have been much more of the story to tell, but the way it ended made me feel like I left the theater a few minutes early to answer an important phone call or something. It maybe a small thing to some, but to me, it really took a lot away from an otherwise terrific film. The Call is not that original, outside of the particular situation, it's a type of film you've seen many times over.

After taking an emergency call from a teenage girl who is subsequently kidnapped and murdered, Turner finds she is no longer able to maintain the emotional distance required of the job and becomes an operator trainer. When another teen is abducted and able to call 911 shortly thereafter, Turner intervenes, leaving her desk to follow the case to its harrowing conclusion.The Call is a pretty decent popcorn thriller with riveting moments throughout. The viewer connects with Jordan and the victim (Abigail Breslin) throughout the nail-biting search. Gorgeous Halle Berry gives an exciting performance in the lead role. The 2002 Best Actress Oscar winner still easily turns heads at age 46. Michael Eklund is fairly creepy as the psychopathic kidnapper. However, the ending of this movie is an absolute stinker. There's no way on God's Earth those two characters would engage in that style of vigilante justice and no way would they have gotten away with it. The conclusion rates a big, fat zero on the plausibility meter. But don't let the completely unconvincing ending keep you away from this movie.

Ellis&#8217; 2004 thriller &#8220;Cellular,&#8221; but the uniqueness of &#8220;The Call&#8221; lies in that the film&#8217;s protagonist, who has to save the abducted girl, is a veteran 911 operator working at emergency call center in LA.The first two thirds of the film is largely about an intense cat-and-mouse chase involving the criminal, a kidnapped girl Casey Welson (Abigail Breslin), Halle Berry&#8217;s 911 operator Jordan Turner, who gets a call from her, and LAPD officers including cool and caring officer Phillips (Morris Chestnut), trying to locate the car that carries the abducted girl.However, this edge-of-your-seat one-hour section is followed by something totally different, something that is surprisingly gruesome.

It looked like a hedgehog curled up and napping on her head.  After that, the movie went even further downhill.This movie has it all: implausible story line, gaping plot holes, continuity errors, incredible circumstances and a terrible ending.  Here is one example: It would be impossible for anyone to forcibly remove a taillight assembly from the inside of a trunk but we are expected to believe that a teenage girl can kick it a few times and it pops out, leaving a huge hole.  She can stick out her arm and pour out a can of paint but when the car stops at an intersection directly in front of other cars, the girl fails to put her arm out to be seen.  Duh...Continuity error: The blonde trainee that Jordan displaces on the headset when Casey calls was supposedly not yet on the job six months earlier but she appeared behind Jordan during the earlier episode.The ending:  Jordan and Casey decide to bind the killer to a dentist's chair in his hidden bunker and leave him to die after quickly cobbling together a flimsy cover story.  I have to believe that the police would have MANY questions about her escape.  ""Tell us about where you were held.""  ""How did you escape?""  ""Where did Jordan find you?""  ""Jordan, why were you in that area?""  The investigation would continue since the killer would still considered to be ""at large"" and the suspect in multiple horrendous killings.

Too bad they didn't continue the story because I would have liked to see how Halle and Abigail provide a statement to the police over what they want them to think happened.Re psychopath's motive - he loved his sister.  The sister was a beautiful blonde cheerleader who died from cancer.  I think he did not like that she ended up wasting away so he found girls that looked like his sister so he can give her her hair back.  Which is totally stupid because there are places where you can buy wigs made of human hair for cancer survivors!",2,"I did scream ""This is so stupid"" in the end",1379980800,"09 24, 2013",2013,1196,"['other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'Call', 'did', 'start', 'off', 'promising', 'edge', 'seat', 'suspenseful', 'even', 'forgave', 'fact', 'man', 'who', 'called', '911', 'should', 'have', 'just', 'driven', 'away', 'called', 'rather', 'be', 'sitting', 'duck', 'psychopath', 'play', 'baseball', 'with.However', 'what', 'was', 'unforgivable', 'downright', 'laughable', 'was', 'when', 'Halle', 'decided', 'go', 'mountains', 'alone', 'even', 'calling', 'cops', 'hunch', 'was', 'stupid', 'considering', 'knew', 'psychopath', 'was', 'violent', 'killed', 'anyone', 'path', 'Why', 'go', 'up', 'there', 'unarmed', 'Why', 'develop', 'butterfingers', 'drop', 'phone', 'ending', 'sealed', 'deal', 'was', 'downright', 'ridiculous', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'continue', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'how', 'Halle', 'Abigail', 'provide', 'statement', 'police', 'what', 'want', 'think', 'happened.Re', 'psychopath', 'motive', 'loved', 'sister', 'sister', 'was', 'beautiful', 'blonde', 'cheerleader', 'who', 'died', 'cancer', 'think', 'did', 'not', 'ended', 'up', 'wasting', 'away', 'so', 'found', 'girls', 'looked', 'sister', 'can', 'give', 'hair', 'back', 'Which', 'totally', 'stupid', 'are', 'places', 'where', 'can', 'buy', 'wigs', 'made', 'human', 'hair', 'cancer', 'survivors']",N/A

1628826,AMI8149RXQ0M5,B00BEIYIF0,Zencik,"[3, 4]","The Call is the type of film that had no business being released in theaters and should've gone straight to video. Not only is this an incredibly generic thriller that feels like a Lifetime movie, but it's increasingly stupid script ruins any somewhat decent things the film has going for it.Halle Berry plays Jordan, a 911 operator who lets her emotions get in the way when a call goes terribly wrong and results in the death of the caller. Not able to handle the guilt, she takes a job as a trainer for future 911 operators. One day while she is in a training session, a call comes up that the present operator can't handle and Jordan steps in and the movie kicks into gear...or at least tries too.I'll give credit where credit is due, the film has a really simple premise and doesn't waste anytime and moves at a very fast pace. Halle Berry also gives a surprisingly good performance for what material she is giving here. The first half of the movie is also semi intriguing and held my interest up until around the 45 minute mark.The main problem with The Call is that it becomes increasingly stupid and improbable. The script is already loaded with terrible dialogue and clich&eacute;s, and this only adds to the film becoming increasingly annoying. The characters are equivalent to the undeveloped teens in a slasher film who make incredibly stupid decisions that no other person in the situation would ever even consider doing. As the film goes on you will think the film can't get any dumber, only for it to shock you within minutes by becoming even more than what previously happened. The rest of the cast here does a really poor job. The worst being Michael Eklund who plays the killer who's performance is way too over-the-top for him to be taken seriously. Although, this is another instance where the script shares a good deal of the blame as the majority of his dialogue is laughable.It's third act is where The Call completely falls off the rails going from a thriller between 911 dispatchers and the victim to a Halle Berry action movie. As terrible as the script is, it at least was consistent for it's first two acts. Not only does it feel completely out of place, but by the end of the film Halle Berry's character's motivations make no sense logically or morally.The Call is a generic, stupid, and ultimately forgettable film that can't even carry it's simple premise throughout it's short 94 minute runtime. If it hadn't been for the third act, then it might've been a passable film for T.V viewing. But, it fails even at that. The Call is the type of film that will most likely soon be in the discount DVD bin at your local Best Buy where it should've been in the first place.",1,Saying It's Stupid Is Being Too Kind,1395273600,"03 20, 2014",2014,2697,"['Call', 'type', 'film', 'had', 'business', 'being', 'released', 'theaters', 'should', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'straight', 'video', 'Not', 'only', 'incredibly', 'generic', 'thriller', 'feels', 'Lifetime', 'movie', 'increasingly', 'stupid', 'script', 'somewhat', 'decent', 'things', 'film', 'going', 'it.Halle', 'Berry', 'Jordan', '911', 'operator', 'who', 'emotions', 'get', 'way', 'when', 'call', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'results', 'death', 'caller', 'Not', 'able', 'handle', 'guilt', 'job', 'trainer', 'future', '911', 'operators', 'One', 'day', 'training', 'session', 'call', 'up', 'present', 'operator', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'Jordan', 'steps', 'movie', 'gear', 'least', 'tries', 'too.I', ""'ll"", 'give', 'credit', 'where', 'credit', 'due', 'film', 'really', 'simple', 'premise', ""n't"", 'waste', 'anytime', 'moves', 'very', 'fast', 'pace', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'also', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'performance', 'what', 'material', 'giving', 'here', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'also', 'semi', 'intriguing', 'held', 'interest', 'up', '45', 'minute', 'mark.The', 'main', 'problem', 'Call', 'increasingly', 'stupid', 'improbable', 'script', 'already', 'loaded', 'terrible', 'dialogue', 'clich', 'eacute', 'only', 'film', 'becoming', 'increasingly', 'annoying', 'characters', 'are', 'equivalent', 'undeveloped', 'teens', 'slasher', 'film', 'who', 'make', 'incredibly', 'stupid', 'decisions', 'other', 'person', 'situation', 'would', 'ever', 'even', 'consider', 'doing', 'film', 'will', 'think', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'dumber', 'only', 'shock', 'minutes', 'becoming', 'even', 'more', 'what', 'previously', 'happened', 'rest', 'cast', 'here', 'really', 'poor', 'job', 'worst', 'being', 'Michael', 'Eklund', 'who', 'killer', 'who', 'performance', 'way', 'too', 'over-the-top', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'instance', 'where', 'script', 'shares', 'good', 'deal', 'blame', 'majority', 'dialogue', 'laughable.It', 'third', 'act', 'where', 'Call', 'completely', 'rails', 'going', 'thriller', '911', 'dispatchers', 'victim', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'action', 'movie', 'As', 'terrible', 'script', 'least', 'was', 'consistent', 'first', 'two', 'acts', 'Not', 'only', 'feel', 'completely', 'place', 'end', 'film', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'character', 'motivations', 'make', 'sense', 'logically', 'morally.The', 'Call', 'generic', 'stupid', 'ultimately', 'forgettable', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'carry', 'simple', 'premise', 'short', '94', 'minute', 'runtime', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'third', 'act', 'then', 'might', ""'ve"", 'been', 'passable', 'film', 'T.V', 'viewing', 'even', 'Call', 'type', 'film', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'soon', 'be', 'discount', 'DVD', 'bin', 'local', 'Best', 'Buy', 'where', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'first', 'place']",N/A
