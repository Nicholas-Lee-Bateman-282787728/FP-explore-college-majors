1382622,A21J6V3Q4PGDYE,B0042AEU6Y,Adam Voorhees,"[0, 0]","This movie seems to inhabit a space in my memory that is usually reserved for paintings. At first you will mistake this for a love story, using the art and culture of a specific location to tell a story of personal discovery, in the tradition of Rosellini's Journey to Italy, or Alain Resnais' Last Year at Marienbad, but when you realize that you are missing significant pieces of the relationship's back story, you are forced to sit up and pay much closer attention. Even though the story is shot in quasi real-time, it seems like the locations the two main characters visit are backdrops in some preconceived kabuki dance.The answers that you want are never fully given, and in the end, it is left up to the viewer to piece together who these people actually are to each other, or if they are even real. This movie may have just been a fluke, I have now watched all the other Kiarostami movies I could find and none of them are on this level. I understand that he is working on something in Italy again, working title of ""Horizontal Process"". Another movie inspired by a specific place and it's cultural history. For me, the verdict is still out on whether he can pay off on the promise in this film again.. but right now, he's at the top of my list of directors to watch, specifically because of this FREE prime streaming movie.. you have no reason not to watch!",5,A surrealist love story,1391299200,"02 2, 2014",2014,1366,"['movie', 'inhabit', 'space', 'memory', 'usually', 'reserved', 'paintings', 'first', 'will', 'mistake', 'love', 'story', 'using', 'art', 'culture', 'specific', 'location', 'tell', 'story', 'personal', 'discovery', 'tradition', 'Rosellini', 'Journey', 'Italy', 'Alain', 'Resnais', 'Last', 'Year', 'Marienbad', 'when', 'realize', 'are', 'missing', 'significant', 'pieces', 'relationship', 'back', 'story', 'are', 'forced', 'sit', 'up', 'pay', 'much', 'closer', 'attention', 'Even', 'story', 'shot', 'quasi', 'real-time', 'locations', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'visit', 'are', 'backdrops', 'preconceived', 'kabuki', 'dance.The', 'answers', 'want', 'are', 'never', 'fully', 'given', 'end', 'left', 'up', 'viewer', 'piece', 'together', 'who', 'people', 'actually', 'are', 'other', 'are', 'even', 'real', 'movie', 'may', 'have', 'just', 'been', 'fluke', 'have', 'now', 'watched', 'other', 'Kiarostami', 'movies', 'could', 'find', 'none', 'are', 'level', 'understand', 'working', 'something', 'Italy', 'again', 'working', 'title', 'Horizontal', 'Process', 'movie', 'inspired', 'specific', 'place', 'cultural', 'history', 'verdict', 'still', 'out', 'can', 'pay', 'off', 'promise', 'film', 'again..', 'right', 'now', 'top', 'list', 'directors', 'watch', 'specifically', 'FREE', 'prime', 'streaming', 'movie..', 'have', 'reason', 'not', 'watch']",Certified Copy
1382623,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0042AEU6Y,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 6]","I'm going to keep this short and sweet despite the fact that I have a lot to say about this film; namely because the beauty this film possesses is almost entirely corroded by the spoiling of its unfolding plot.  To say that this film is pure magic would be an understatement, for it is probably one of the most honest and poignant looks at relationships I've ever had the pleasure of watching.  Taking a seeming chance meeting between an author and an art gallery owner and using it as a medium to enrich the audience with a breathtaking point of view regarding love, life and marriage; `Certified Copy' is simply flawless.That gallery owner is Elle, played with natural charm and ease by the stunning Juliette Binoche (in possibly the finest performance of 2011).  That author is James.  James and Elle meet at a conference and come together for a day of sightseeing in beautiful Tuscany.  They share a love of art, yet mixed feelings regarding the purity of said art.  As the day unfolds, the contrast between authenticated art pieces and mere copies bleeds into life in general, as truths about Elle and James become manifest in slight yet overwhelming details.  The concept of art imitating life is taking rather literally here, but not in the sense that one might initially expect.  Instead, the film is filled with subtle comparisons that help highlight the true intentions of writer/director Abbas Kiarostami.  With a deft hand (oh my, those soft directorial flourishes are magnificent), Kiarostami coaxes a beautifully delicate relationship between two very dynamic souls.I don't want to give anything away!I'll end by noting Juliette Binoche, because her performance is one of the best I've seen in years.  The way that she completely bares her soul with such soft undertones is flawless.  I love the way she is always reacting to what is going on around her.  Her eyes are constantly reflecting her inner mood, even when her face remains stagnant.  The `coffee shop scene' alone is a work of genius and she OWNS that scene with such heartbreaking realism.  I love her naturalness.  Binoche reminds me of my love for Kristen Scott-Thomas, another actress who just breathes such infectious charm into her performances.  The way that Binoche can play with her character is compelling.  I love how she shifts her moods with ease, never feeling out of place but always feeling genuine in tone.  The final scene is a flawless depiction of her character's need to feel something nostalgic in order to justify her affections.  She just wants to hold on with dear life.I'll say no more; just watch this movie.  It is so deeply effective and it sneaks up on you in more ways than one.  It is a very fresh and original spin on the `relationship movie', and it certainly will remain one of the best films of 2011.",5,Not all is as it seems...,1326153600,"01 10, 2012",2012,2811,"[""'m"", 'going', 'keep', 'short', 'sweet', 'fact', 'have', 'lot', 'say', 'film', 'namely', 'beauty', 'film', 'almost', 'entirely', 'corroded', 'spoiling', 'unfolding', 'plot', 'say', 'film', 'pure', 'magic', 'would', 'be', 'understatement', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'honest', 'poignant', 'looks', 'relationships', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'pleasure', 'watching', 'Taking', 'seeming', 'chance', 'meeting', 'author', 'art', 'gallery', 'owner', 'using', 'medium', 'enrich', 'audience', 'breathtaking', 'point', 'view', 'regarding', 'love', 'life', 'marriage', 'Certified', 'Copy', 'simply', 'flawless.That', 'gallery', 'owner', 'Elle', 'played', 'natural', 'charm', 'ease', 'stunning', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'possibly', 'finest', 'performance', '2011', 'author', 'James', 'James', 'Elle', 'meet', 'conference', 'come', 'together', 'day', 'sightseeing', 'beautiful', 'Tuscany', 'share', 'love', 'art', 'yet', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'regarding', 'purity', 'said', 'art', 'day', 'contrast', 'authenticated', 'art', 'pieces', 'mere', 'copies', 'life', 'general', 'truths', 'Elle', 'James', 'become', 'manifest', 'slight', 'yet', 'overwhelming', 'details', 'concept', 'art', 'imitating', 'life', 'taking', 'rather', 'literally', 'here', 'not', 'sense', 'one', 'might', 'initially', 'expect', 'Instead', 'film', 'filled', 'subtle', 'comparisons', 'help', 'highlight', 'true', 'intentions', 'writer/director', 'Abbas', 'Kiarostami', 'deft', 'hand', 'oh', 'soft', 'directorial', 'flourishes', 'are', 'magnificent', 'Kiarostami', 'beautifully', 'delicate', 'relationship', 'two', 'very', 'dynamic', 'souls.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'anything', 'away', ""'ll"", 'end', 'noting', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'performance', 'one', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years', 'way', 'completely', 'soul', 'such', 'soft', 'undertones', 'flawless', 'love', 'way', 'always', 'reacting', 'what', 'going', 'eyes', 'are', 'constantly', 'reflecting', 'inner', 'mood', 'even', 'when', 'face', 'stagnant', 'coffee', 'shop', 'scene', 'alone', 'work', 'genius', 'OWNS', 'scene', 'such', 'heartbreaking', 'realism', 'love', 'naturalness', 'Binoche', 'love', 'Kristen', 'Scott-Thomas', 'actress', 'who', 'just', 'breathes', 'such', 'infectious', 'charm', 'performances', 'way', 'Binoche', 'can', 'play', 'character', 'compelling', 'love', 'how', 'shifts', 'moods', 'ease', 'never', 'feeling', 'place', 'always', 'feeling', 'genuine', 'tone', 'final', 'scene', 'flawless', 'depiction', 'character', 'need', 'feel', 'something', 'nostalgic', 'order', 'justify', 'affections', 'just', 'hold', 'dear', 'life.I', ""'ll"", 'say', 'no', 'more', 'just', 'watch', 'movie', 'so', 'deeply', 'effective', 'up', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'very', 'fresh', 'original', 'spin', 'relationship', 'movie', 'certainly', 'will', 'remain', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2011']",Certified Copy

The main characters are quite capable, but their talents wasted.Very slow, but has potential for the first 20 minutes.  But nothing happens.  Then it takes a strange turn, apparently for lack of a better idea.  At that point the characters shift almost wildly from scene to scene.  Very uneven, and the acting up until then was good.  After that, and I blame the director, the acting is contrived though it could hardly be otherwise with such a weak plot that has devolved into meaninglessness.  You would like to care about the characters, but the story line has made that impossible.  In the end they annoy you for being so lacking in depth, or life or purpose.  A very cardboard cutout  ending with no point to make.  The film makers have forgotten the point by then if there ever was one.Short version:  Wish I had the nearly two hours of my life back.

1382626,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B0042AEU6Y,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[1, 1]","The multi-talented filmmaker Abbas Kiarostami is known for his films, documentaries, poetry, paintings and graphic designs.  Considered as one of the most influential filmmakers to come from the Middle East and known for his films such as the ""Koker Trilogy"", ""Taste of Cherry"", ""The Wind Will Carry Us"" and ""Close Up"", in 2010, Kiarostami would reunite with his ""Shirin"" actress, Juliette Binoche for the film ""Certified Copy"" (Copie Conforme).Written and directed by Abbas Kiarostami and shot in Tuscany, ""Certified Copy"" would feature Juliette Binoche (""Thee Colors: Blue"", ""The English Patient"", ""Cache"") and opera singer William Shimell (""Hercules"", ""Love"").  The film would be Kiarostami's first film shot and produced outside of Iran, it would also be the first film of Kiarostami in creating European cinema.  And sure enough, the film would receive rave reviews from critics and audiences worldwide and the film would also earn Juliette Binoche the ""Best Actress Award"" at the Cannes Film Festival.And now ""Certified Copy"" will be released on Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of the Criterion Collection.  Also, included with this release is Abbas Kiarostami's first feature film, ""The Report"" (1977).VIDEO:""Certified Copy"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1 aspect ratio) and there is no doubt that Kiarostami's use of the Red digital camera brought a lot of detail to his latest film.  The colors are vibrant, detail and clarity look magnificent and  I detected no video-related problems, no artifacts, banding, edge enhancement...nothing.  ""Certified Copy"" looks absolutely magnificent on Blu-ray!According to the Criterion Collection, the film was shot in 4K RAW using a RED digital camera and the entire production was completed in a fully digital workflow.  The color grading and digital interpositive were approved by director Abbas Kiarostami and director of photography Luca Bigazzi.  The final color corrected DPX files were output to Rec. 709 high-definition color space for BD and DVD release.As for ""The Report"", the Criterion Collection presents the 1977 film in the best quality available to them.  While the film looks good for its age.  While there is some film damage with occasional green lines that can be seen and some other damage.  But most visible towards the beginning of the film.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Certified Copy"" is presented in English, French and Italian DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 (note: one audio track, with all three languages used in the film).  Dialogue is crystal clear and the film features good use of atmospheric ambiance.  From the sounds of Tuscany, the birds and vehicles and more.  The lossless track is primarily dialogue-driven through the front and center channels but the audio quality is great and I detected no audio problems.  Optional Subtitles are included.According to the Criterion Collection, the original 5.1 lossless soundtrack was mastered at 24-bit from the original digital audio master using Pro Tools HD.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Certified Copy - The Criterion Collection #612&#8243; on Blu-ray comes with the following special features:The Report - (1:49:28) A civil servant is a hard worker but is often not there for his wife and child.  But when he is accused of bribery, his life starts to change and his marriage also begins to suffer.Abbas Kiarostami - (16:02) Featuring an interview with Abbas Kiarostami who talks about the film, what inspired the film and finding the cast members for the film.Let's See ""Copia Conforme"" - (52:05) A documentary by Irene Bufo featuring the making of the film and interviews with Kiarostami, the cast and crew.Theatrical trailer - (2:14) Theatrical trailer for ""Certified Copy"".EXTRAS:""Certified Copy - The Criterion Collection #612&#8243; comes with a 24-page booklet featuring the essay ""At Home and Abroad"" by Godfrey Chesire.JUDGMENT CALL:When it comes to films that are verbose, cerebral and dialogue-driven, more often, they can be too much for a viewer.  But when executed perfectly, you know you have something special.May it be a film like Eric Rohmer's ""My Night at Maud's"" where characters spend a long time in discussion, but these they talk about aren't banal, these are intelligent discussions by two individuals about life, art, reproduction.  But then you get this little twist that is reminiscent of Michelangelo's Antonioni's ""L'Avventura"" or Alain Resnais ""Last Year At Marienbad"" where the characters may appear to have known each other or perhaps have been in a relationship before, because their intelligent discussion leads to an argument that couples experience.And that is one thing that is rather fascinating about ""Certified Copy"", unlike Resnais ""Last Year at Marienbad"" which surrealism and visual filmmaking come together in a rather complex fashion, Kiarostami's ""Certified Copy"" gives us no clues that the two are a couple, a former couple or two people trying to act out an experiment of relationships.  Or perhaps it is a dream... or is it reality?Nothing is explained but it allows the viewer to give their own interpretation.  And this is important because the film's original topic was about the concept of art and reproduction.  When we look at art, we have a response toward it. But that response can be different.  The same with this relationship, we have our own interpretation if these two characters.  In my mind, almost like painting that I spend a lot of time watching in a museum... you have these ideas of what is the intention of the artwork, what is the history and was the painting influenced by another.With the characters of James Miller and the antique dealer, my mind was already dead set that these two individuals knew each other long ago, were in love and this visit was a way for them to escape reality and re-enact a moment of what if they were a couple.Now I go back to the common argument of the film, art vs. reproduction and how the character of James Miller felt that reproductions were originals, as the original was also inspired or a copy of something else.  And when you start to think of the film and analyze it, what if that was the initial thought.  Using art as a symbol, but featuring cinema.  Cinema like art can be original but yet others  may feel it's a copy or inspired by another film.And then you wonder if its life imitating art.  Abbas Kiarostami once told actress Juliette Binoche that the film was based on his life, then changed his story that it was based on his life and then tells media that it s a story that incorporates Juliette's life.  In other words, the message is that art, cinema and everything created can be original but yet can be inspired by something else.  So, what others will think of ""Certified Copy"" as original, others may point to Resnais ""Last Year at Marienbad"", Antonioni's ""L'Avventura"" or Wong Kar-Wai's ""In the Mood for Love"", and think that the film was inspired by those or other similar, dream-like type of films.But do we need an explanation of why Kiarostami created the film?  I don't think so, and that's what makes ""Certified Copy"" so enjoyable to watch.  It's a film that YOU interpret on your own.  And if everyone comes up with a different answer, then so be it, I'm sure filmmaker Abbas Kiarostami would be pleased.Another reason why I enjoyed ""Certified Copy"" is how Kiarostami handles relationships.  He goes into more detail about this in the special feature but it's the concept of the conflicts that are experienced between a man and woman in a relationship.  The more we understand each other, the worse things get.  And it's a concept that many married couples or those who have been in long time relationships can understand.  When things go bad, we look to others who make things look as they are going so great but are they?  We have two characters who are somewhat soul searching and through each other, may it be through this playful interaction or may they be true emotions that are coming out, it's that sense of the unpredictable that captivates us.  There is more going on with these two that is explained but yet, these conflicts can be understood, because many of us have experienced these uncertainties as well.As for the performance, Juliette Binoche was absolutely fantastic in this film and for a first time major role for opera singer William Shimell, to have him memorize his line, including the long dialogue (which surprised Binoche who didn't memorize everything, and utilized improvisation to coincide with Shimell's performance) and literally be prepared for his role, I was impressed by his performance.  But both talents did a wonderful job.As for the Blu-ray release, ""Certified Copy"" looks amazing on Blu-ray and cineaste who are fans of Kiarostami's work should be pleased as there are no video or audio-related problems that I could find with this release.  And as far as special features go, it's one thing that you get a documentary on the making-of the film and an interview with Kiarostami but the fact that the Criterion Collection also included his first feature film ""The Report"" (1977) with this release is fantastic!Overall, if you are a cinema fan who loves films that incorporate intelligent conversation but also a film that incorporates Abbas Kiarostami's brilliant direction and fascinating screenplay, which also further compliments the performance by Juliette Binoche and William Shimell, ""Certified Copy"" is highly recommended!",5,(4.5 stars) A film that showcases Abbas Kiarostami's beautiful direction and fascinating screenplay...,1352332800,"11 8, 2012",2012,9412,"['multi-talented', 'filmmaker', 'Abbas',

The professor keeps his distance from real life (everything is evidence of one thesis or another to him even though there is plenty of evidence that he doesn't really believe his own thesis) but the gallery owner with her earthy charms and common sense appeals nonetheless tries to seduce him away from his intellectual formulations. Kiarostami, in true art film fashion, weaves plenty of ambiguity into his tale. Although the self-satisified professor is something of a cliche/copy of other self-satisfied professors, he is intrigued by the gallery owners more natural way of connecting to art which to her is an extension of life. And while the gallery owner is something of a cliche/single mother with 11 yr old child, she is intrigued by the professors devotion to his work. Each seems to draw the other out of his or her usual channels/frequencies, at least in those rare moments when they are not arguing. One could say that the professor and the gallery owner are both grown tired of their roles and their meeting or meetings (it is unclear throughout how long and in what capacity these two know each other) afford them the opportunity to see themselves (the cliched roles they play and views they hold) more clearly. One of Kiarostami's earlier films, Close-Up (1990), is about a man who poses as a famous fim director and while playing this assumed role he has the power to affect other's lives (until his ""true"" identity is revealed). In Certified Copy, the director again allows us to consider the power of illusion and play.

First of all if you have not been married and/or been in long-term relationships you will NOT understand this film. The French are very much in-touch with the subtleties between men and women and this complicated screenplay shows this. Juliette Binoche (no stranger to personal partner problems herself) turns in a stunning performance of a shattered wife. I very much liked the subtlety of this screenplay, in that it takes us through the introduction between the man and woman, gradually showing their building assertiveness and distaste for each other's nuances, which we can't pinpoint as to cause. It is not until half way through the film that we discover they have been married for fifteen years and he has been away living his own life, while she meanders through her directionless life with a dysfunctional son in tow. The screenplay explores the levels of a relationship before, during and after marriage and the changes which take place with partners. If anything, a screenplay like this reiterates that men and women do not do well on their own and are meant to be partnered up as a working unit! It explores the methodologies partners utilize to demand attention, respect, care, love and protection from their significant-others; and when they do not get these things the unit disintegrates. Binoche illustrates the woman who's heart has been torn out of her chest long ago, but maintains a microscopic hope that a reconciliation could be possible; while her husband maintains his aloofness and self-protection of the isolationist...safety in aloneness! It is a heartbreaking story, but is so common in the millions of partners that everyone can identify.  Men and women need each other, but to maintain a partnership is all but impossible! Extreme food- for-thought...with perhaps no solution in sight. See it! If nothing else, it will realign your priorities and help you see alternatives.

Yet, something odd immediately strikes you as you sense there is more to this encounter than just a random book signing especially when the son mentions, with his wry smile, the lack of a surname in some of the signings. The age of the son and future conversations involving events from 5 and 15 years ago and discourse about the nature of being authentic and taking responsibility and relationships are suggestive of one interpretation. But, also are the abstract discussions on original art vs. copies as applied to people's relationships. She not only leads while walking but controls the discussion throughout the movie.

Film is indeed the equal to those other artforms, but only on its own terms, never by trying to be something that its not. Which brings us to the film in question, Certified Copy. It takes some very timeworn post-modern theories about art and reality and applies them to a rather pedestrian story about a relationship between a man and a woman. What results might one expect from this? Something that's all over the place and never completely decides what it's saying? I would say so. Godard got away with this sort of thing in the 60's because it was the 60's and he was Godard. What's Kiarostami's alibi for here in 2000's? I would say it was a semi-noble attempt to make an art film like this in this day and age...but on the other hand, it just feels like wishful thinking, that somehow there's something new to be said. Anyway, the film gets upped from one star to two because Juliette Binoche was good and the film was at least watchable (barely).

The author is a British writer named James Miller (opera star William Shimell) who admits he has no training in art.  His book argues the point that a ""copy"" of a painting or piece of art that is a well made counterfeit is no less valuable than the ""original.""  The woman slips an address to the writer's translator after being hounded by her teenage son that he's hungry.  It is the address of her art shop.  Miller shows up and they begin a conversation that will last for the next 90 minutes.The woman drives him to a remote village and along the way they have some mild disagreements.  Do they really know each other?  Once in the village, a caf&eacute; owner assumes they are married after overhearing an argument.  Are they?  Were they?  The couple now behaves like a once married or now married couple.  The woman suggests they visit a room where they had their honeymoon.  Miller doesn't seem to be interested or even familiar with the town.  So what's going on? Beats me.To complicate matter further, the woman and Miller speak fluent English, French and Italian and shift in and out of those languages often.  Sometimes they speak the same language, sometimes one is speaking one, while the other is speaking something else, all at the same time.  I'm sure Iranian director and writer Abbas Kiarostami is trying to confuse the audience and he succeeds.  For me this was pretty boring after a while.  Certainly Binoche and Shimell are a handsome couple and look like they belong together.  Their performances are very good but I'm not sure they knew what Kiarostami had in mind either.I watched this film on a Criterion Blu ray 1080p transfer.

The latest film by celebrated Iranian filmmaker Abbas Kiarostami is also his first to be filmed outside of his native country.  Starring Juliette Binoche (who took home the best actress award at Cannes for her stunningly enigmatic performance in this film), Certified Copy starts from a premise that promises an exotic love story, and gradually turns into a subtle and profound meditation on art, memory, truth, and identity.To give a quick sense of the feel of this remarkable film I might suggest it combines the conversational intimacy ofBefore Sunsetand the intellectual intrigue ofLast Year at Marienbad.  The problem is that comparison makes this seem like a derivative work, that merely copies elements of established works.  It's not.  Like all of the works I've seen by Abbas Kiarostami, this is a true original.  Or if its a copy, it's a genuine copy.  It's a fascinating film, that I've seen twice now, and that I look forward to watching again, since I got even more from it the second time.  It's a densely layered film, where details refer to other details, and each calls up a range of themes and ideas, but where the intellectual intrigue is balanced by an emotional tension and resonance, and that wears its layers lightly, almost as if it were all improvised.  It's both a delightful romance - that might be said to skip the romance, straight to the after of the happily ever after - and a subtle philosophical exploration of a wide range of fascinating themes.(Note that this review is for the film itself, which I saw in theaters, and not for this particular Blu-Ray edition, which I don't have.)",5,A fascinating and fun philosophical romance - from the always intriguing Abbas Kiarostami,1323475200,"12 10, 2011",2011,1793,"['author', 'tour', 'promote', 'book', 'apparently', 'chance', 'meeting', 'French', 'woman', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'encounter', 'be', 'something', 'far', 'more', 'casual', 'latest', 'film', 'celebrated', 'Iranian', 'filmmaker', 'Abbas', 'Kiarostami', 'also', 'first', 'be', 'filmed', 'native', 'country', 'Starring', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'who', 'took', 'home', 'best', 'actress', 'award', 'Cannes', 'stunningly', 'enigmatic', 'performance', 'film', 'Certified', 'Copy', 'premise', 'exotic', 'love', 'story', 'gradually', 'subtle', 'profound', 'meditation', 'art', 'memory', 'truth', 'identity.To', 'give', 'quick', 'sense', 'feel', 'remarkable', 'film', 'might', 'suggest', 'conversational', 'intimacy', 'ofBefore', 'Sunsetand', 'intellectual', 'intrigue', 'Year', 'Marienbad', 'problem', 'comparison', 'seem', 'derivative', 'work', 'merely', 'elements', 'established', 'works', 'not', 'works', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Abbas', 'Kiarostami', 'true', 'original', 'copy', 'genuine', 'copy', 'fascinating', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'twice', 'now', 'look', 'forward', 'watching', 'again', 'got', 'even', 'more', 'second', 'time', 'densely', 'layered', 'film', 'where', 'details', 'refer', 'other', 'details', 'up', 'range', 'themes', 'ideas', 'where', 'intellectual', 'intrigue', 'balanced', 'emotional', 'tension', 'resonance', 'layers', 'lightly', 'almost', 'were', 'improvised', 'delightful', 'romance', 'might', 'be', 'said', 'skip', 'romance', 'straight', 'happily', 'ever', 'subtle', 'philosophical', 'exploration', 'wide', 'range', 'fascinating', 'themes', 'Note', 'review', 'film', 'saw', 'theaters', 'not', 'particular', 'Blu-Ray', 'edition', 'do', ""n't"", 'have']",Certified Copy

Some bystanders even appear to be gawking at the camera. This gives &#34;Certified Copy&#34; the look of authenticity, for the viewer becomes a witness to the filmmaker's travelogue while also deeply caring for what happens between Elle and James (Juliette Binoche and William Shimell). I won't give away the end, but my sympathies went to Elle, a sweet single mom who is willing to invest her soul in a man she loves, while the object of her affection, James Miller, finds no one quite as interesting as himself, fascinated by his own wit and intelligence. At one critical point, he puts his arm on Elle's shoulder, and we hope that he is finally learning to open up his heart and share his emotions rather than secluding them within.

1382649,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0042AEU6Y,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[11, 13]","&lt;strong>Copie Conforme&lt;/strong> (Abbas Kiarostami, 2010)Imagine &lt;em>Saw&lt;/em> if it had been made by B&eacute;la Tarr.Okay, I know I'm getting even more disbelieving looks than usual here, but let's face it: &lt;em>Copie Conforme&lt;/em> is a Big Reveal movie, just as &lt;em>Saw&lt;/em> is. Looked at in that regard, the ambiguity that so many people talk about pretty much goes away; there's a mystery to be solved here. The only difference is that it's not the characters who are trying to solve the mystery; they know everything, and because they know everything, they have no reason to explain it to themselves. We, the audience, are trying to work out the relationships here. And Kiarostami is, for most of the film, about as interested as the characters are in helping us work that out; in many of the movie's scenes, in fact, he is consciously obfuscating things, and the way the film is shot makes that all too plain. As to where the Tarr part comes in, aside from Kiarostami's wonderful soundplay and a few shots all to reminiscent of the Hungarian master, Tarr's movies, be they his shorter crime films (e.g., &lt;em>The Man from London&lt;/em>) or his longer meditations on the fall of the Soviet Union (e.g., &lt;em>S&agrave;t&agrave;ntang&oacute;&lt;/em>), the structure of every Tarr film is the same: languid save one moment of unadulterated violence.The film opens with a talk at a university. Actually, the film opens with with the audience (both in the cinema and on the screen) waiting for a talk at a university. It is to be given by James Miller (William Shimell is his first big-screen appearance), a cultural historian who has wandered into the art world, according to his own later declamations, seemingly by accident. His book, which has the same name as the film, has won some sort of obscure prize, and he's giving the thank-you speech. Or he will, if he ever gets there. (This is important.) He eventually does show up, and launches into his speech, which he gives in a mixture of English and stumbling Italian (I assume it's meant to be stumbling, but I don't have nearly enough knowledge of what Italian is supposed to sound like despite my &lt;em>giallo&lt;/em> fetish). As he's getting started, a woman and her son slip in and find their way to the reserved seating. This, we find out later, is Elle (Juliette Binoche), a local antiques dealer. She is unable to stay for the entire lecture, so she slips James' friend, the university professor who introduced him, her number and takes her son Julian (&lt;em>Im Schwitzkasten&lt;/em>'s Adrian Moore) for a burger. The two of them have a conversation that seems mundane, but ends up perhaps provoking more thought than anything in the film. In any case, later that morning, Elle presumably gets a call from James, who shows up in her antique shop. She promises to show him something interesting if he's got the time to spare; he replies that he has to be back in time to catch a nine o'clock train. No problem, and they depart Arezzo for Lucignano, which we are told is half an hour away or thereabouts. They see what she has come to show him, but it's after that that things get interesting, as we start to question not the nature of their relationship, but the way Kiarostami has presented their relationship to us.Not helping the matter is that Kiarostami, who also wrote the script, is involved in constant misdirection as to what the mystery even &lt;em>is&lt;/em> (the question I hear most asked, and the one it was easiest to answer by halfway through the film, is ""dis these people know each other before the movie started?""). Again, not that he hides this fact from us at all; this is ""mystery"" in its most existential form, and also again, there's no mystery in the film itself. Everyone there knows what's going on, even the people who have never met these folks before, including the proprietor of a local coffee shop (&lt;em>Tea with Mussolini&lt;/em>'s Gianna Giachetti) and an older couple Elle ropes into a discussion on a statue in a little square in Lucignano (&lt;em>La Charme Discret de la Bourgeoisie&lt;/em>'s Jean-Claude Carri&eacute;re and &lt;em>Micmacs&lt;/em>' Agathe Natanson). In case you haven't noticed, this movie has one hell of a cast, which makes it even more impressive that Shimell, who previously had acted in a few made-for-TV movies, holds his own against them. (Even more impressive is Adrian Moore, whose part is small, but wonderful.) But I digress. Kiarostami is using this to slap us in the face, as it were, with how we simply don't get it. (Don't worry, there's more to this tale than anyone else gets, either.) But the slap, as it did in his wonderful &lt;em>Ta'm e Guilass&lt;/em>, comes with a velvet glove. After all, Kiarostami is doing his best to confuse you. Take the beginning of that car ride, while the two of them are still in Arezzo. There's a long, languid conversation, some joking. All the while they're driving through the narrow streets, and you can see the buildings on either side reflected in the windshield. The buildings on either side of the street are different, but constant, colors, so the view of James is always occluded by off-white, whereas the view of Elle is always occluded with a sort of terracotta yellow. (I wish I'd been paying enough attention to be able to make some salient comment on the changes in conversation when they pass into shadow.) This sort of occlusion is present throughout, as we often see the characters through, or in, reflections, both from glass (display cases, picture windows, etc.) and in mirrors. As well, remember I talked about Tarr and soundplay? There are times when we can't hear what James and Elle are saying thanks to the soundplay. The mike will focus on a presenter at a small museum talking about a piece of art, or a traveling accordion player (how Tarr is that?) will pass between the camera and the couple, and we will hear nothing of them, or the people they're talking to.The mirrors are especially important in a movie where every shot is blocked with importance. While Kiarostami is interested in obfuscation, there's a point where you can't obfuscate any more. Ironically (and meant as such), the two times when our main characters are most naked is a long, stationary shot in a mirror. While I can't say more without spoiling it, the placement of these two shots is perhaps the most important thing in the film for figuring out the mystery (the solution to which is there for all to see in the film's final spoken line, by the way).The one place it falls just shy of genius is in the conversation Elle has with Julian. Taken on its own, it is an excellent scene, full of the little details that make this movie wonderful. But in the greater context, it serves only to throw confusion onto confusion. It's the one place that Kiarostami's obfuscation becomes manipulation, and the scene--and the film--suffers for it.Is that a reason not to see it? Of course not. Even Roger Ebert, whose distaste for Kiarostami is legendary (his reaction to &lt;em>Ta'm e Guilass&lt;/em> started a friendly rivalry between Ebert and Jonathan Rosenbaum that continues to this day, and the first sentence of his review of &lt;em>Ten&lt;/em> is ""I am unable to grasp the greatness of Abbas Kiarostami.""), gave the film three and a half stars, though the text of the review itself strikes me as lukewarm at best (""[f]or me, it is too clever by half, creating full-bodied characters but inserting them into a story that is thin soup.""). This is another way in which Kiarostami reminds me of Tarr: even if you've no idea what's going on, the film is so beautiful, and the characters so intriguing, the movie's worth seeing. But unlike Tarr, whose movies are so often about nothing but the day-to-day life of his characters, Kiarostami does, in fact, have a Big Reveal. It's subtle enough, however, that even people who saw it and half-understood its significance often don't make the (to me obvious) final leap. Give it a shot and see if you hit the bullseye. *** ",4,"Beautiful, solid, thought-provoking.",1317168000,"09 28, 2011",2011,8062,"['lt', 'strong', '>', 'Copie', 'Conforme', 'lt', '>', 'Abbas',

Or are they an actual married couple simply pretending to be strangers as a means of seeing their relationship from a fresh perspective and perhaps giving themselves a chance to start over as a couple?As presented to us at the start, Elle (played by the always wonderful Juliette Binoche) is an attractive middle-aged single mother who is finding it increasingly difficult to both raise her rather trying adolescent son and retain any identify of her own.  James Miller (played by British opera singer William Shimell) is a well-known cultural critic who has just written a best-seller, ""Certified Copy,"" on the subject of originals and copies in art.  After attending one of his lectures, Binoche meets up with Miller one Sunday, and together they spend a desultory afternoon touring the Italian countryside , first getting to know one another, then assuming the roles of husband and wife, whereupon they quarrel and bicker, flirt with and wound one another, and come to terms with how love and marriage change over the years.  So is this an original - i.e., actual - married couple or a copy of one?  I don't think we're supposed to know, and, frankly, I suspect that`s the way Iranian writer/director Abbas Kiarostami intended it to be.The multi-national ""Certified Copy"" is a leisurely paced, loquacious, but often insightful look into the nature of man/woman relationships.  Binoche and Shimell do a beautiful job embodying the two characters, while Kiarostami's direction is spare and unobtrusive, often lingering for long stretches of time on his actors' faces while they articulate at great length their characters' innermost feelings and concerns.Clearly, ""Certified Copy"" is not for all viewers, some of whom may conclude that the two of them are simply bananas and, thus, opt to move on.  But for those willing to suspend their disbelief and accept something a little different, the film is filled with many rewards.

In researching Kiarostami, I stumbled across the observation that his films tend to be insular and self-referential. Given my previous experiences with his work, namely the minimalist yet profoundly philosophical and formally unique Taste of Cherry (1997), I'm not surprised to find that Certified Copy lives up to this alleged attribute of the director. I can't say that I've seen a film quite like this, which appears at first to be influenced by the likes of Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise and Before Sunset. But it expands and contracts and shifts as it moves along, ending on such a unique and somewhat perplexing (yet remarkably euphoric) note that all attempts at fitting Certified Copy into the history of cinema quickly become futile, that is unless you consider Kiarostami's oeuvre. It is then immediately surmisable that this lovely, confounding essay could only emerge from this decidedly singular artist.The film opens in Italy, where British writer James Miller (William Shimell) is giving a lecture on his latest book, an exploration of the concepts of originality and authenticity in works of art. An unnamed admirer, played by Juliette Binoche, sits restless in the front row, distracted by the nagging of her son who is more interested in satiating his hunger than listening to Miller's theories. She is forced to leave early, passing along her number so that she might meet Miller at her antique shop where he will sign copies of his book. Once the two unite, we are swept into the sometimes uncomfortable cadence that characterizes the intersection of strangers. Eventually, it is suggested that they are actually estranged lovers of some kind, perhaps playing the role of a pair of people who have never known each other.What we ultimately discover is not a romance but a sudden, perhaps jarring transformation within the confines of an incredibly specific discussion of whether or not there is such a thing as replication. Everything in life is a matter of perspective, and this idea plays directly into how the film is constructed and how it unfolds. The film making itself reveals early on that we are not to settle into anything or become familiar with anyone. As the antique dealer and the academic drive through town soon after connecting, we notice and are taken by the picturesque windshield reflections of a Tuscan town superimposed on unfamiliar faces, only to feel suddenly cheated somehow. Kiarostami places a slowly changing, physically beautiful wall between us and the protagonists, obfuscating our standard opportunity to visually engage with the main characters.This is but one example of the ways in which the cinematic medium is uniquely employed to keep the audience on its toes, conjuring a curiosity as to which perspective is most important or most accurate. The curiosity does not cease, and that is Kiarostami's master stroke. Juliette Binoche in particular manages to occupy a multiplicity of emotional states that serve to underline Kiarostami's intentions with Certified Copy. Binoche performs this role like an actress at the peak of her talents, fully inhabiting each moment so that our suspicion that this narrative is absolutely real does not dissipate.Kiarostami continues to suggest and hint until he finally pushes us into the perspective that we suspect must be true, an end result that hardly provides answers. Miller's ideas always populate their discussion, generating debates and drawing out emotions, but the expansion into the personal begins to add gravity. Through all of the playfulness and reconsideration, Kiarostami, his cast, and his crew achieve a deep sense of truth, a kind of emotional realism that only rings more clearly because it defies you to settle on a conclusion. Rarely do I come across a film that feels as much like a challenge as it does like a fresh idea, a quiet revelation that I very suddenly hoped would disappear behind the screen of intellectualism.",5,Genuinely emotional look at relationshps and authenticity,1327276800,"01 23, 2012",2012,4153,"['Certified', 'Copy', 'Iranian', 'film-maker', 'Abbas', 'Kiarostami', 'first', 'European', 'film', 'certainly', 'succeeded', 'continuing', 'legacy', 'fascinating', 'intellectual', 'cinema', 'delving', 'foreign', 'territory', 'researching', 'Kiarostami', 'stumbled', 'observation', 'films', 'tend', 'be', 'insular', 'self-referential', 'Given', 'previous', 'experiences', 'work', 'namely', 'minimalist', 'yet', 'profoundly', 'philosophical', 'formally', 'unique', 'Taste', 'Cherry', '1997', ""'m"", 'not', 'surprised', 'find', 'Certified', 'Copy', 'up', 'alleged', 'attribute', 'director', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'quite', 'first', 'be', 'influenced', 'likes', 'Richard', 'Linklater', 'Before', 'Sunrise', 'Sunset', 'contracts', 'shifts', 'along', 'ending', 'unique', 'somewhat', 'perplexing', 'yet', 'remarkably', 'euphoric', 'note', 'attempts', 'fitting', 'Certified', 'Copy', 'history', 'cinema', 'quickly', 'become', 'futile', 'consider', 'Kiarostami', 'oeuvre', 'then', 'immediately', 'surmisable', 'lovely', 'confounding', 'essay', 'could', 'only', 'emerge', 'decidedly', 'singular', 'artist.The', 'film', 'Italy', 'where', 'British', 'writer', 'James', 'Miller', 'William', 'Shimell', 'giving', 'lecture', 'latest', 'book', 'exploration', 'concepts', 'originality', 'authenticity', 'works', 'art', 'unnamed', 'admirer', 'played', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'restless', 'front', 'row', 'distracted', 'nagging', 'son', 'who', 'more', 'interested', 'satiating', 'hunger', 'listening', 'Miller', 'theories', 'forced', 'leave', 'early', 'passing', 'number', 'might', 'meet', 'Miller', 'antique', 'shop', 'where', 'will', 'sign', 'copies', 'book', 'two', 'unite', 'are', 'swept', 'sometimes', 'uncomfortable', 'cadence', 'intersection', 'strangers', 'Eventually', 'suggested', 'are', 'actually', 'estranged', 'lovers', 'kind', 'perhaps', 'playing', 'role', 'pair', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'known', 'ultimately', 'discover', 'not', 'romance', 'sudden', 'perhaps', 'jarring', 'transformation', 'confines', 'incredibly', 'specific', 'discussion', 'not', 'such', 'thing', 'replication', 'Everything', 'life', 'matter', 'perspective', 'idea', 'directly', 'how', 'film', 'constructed', 'how', 'film', 'making', 'reveals', 'early', 'are', 'not', 'settle', 'anything', 'become', 'familiar', 'anyone', 'antique', 'dealer', 'academic', 'drive', 'town', 'soon', 'connecting', 'notice', 'are', 'taken', 'picturesque', 'windshield', 'reflections', 'Tuscan', 'town', 'superimposed', 'unfamiliar', 'only', 'feel', 'suddenly', 'cheated', 'somehow', 'Kiarostami', 'slowly', 'changing', 'physically', 'beautiful', 'wall', 'protagonists', 'obfuscating', 'standard', 'opportunity', 'visually', 'engage', 'main', 'characters.This', 'one', 'example', 'ways', 'cinematic', 'medium', 'uniquely', 'employed', 'keep', 'audience', 'toes', 'conjuring', 'curiosity', 'perspective', 'most', 'important', 'most', 'accurate', 'curiosity', 'not', 'cease', 'Kiarostami', 'master', 'stroke', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'particular', 'manages', 'occupy', 'multiplicity', 'emotional', 'states', 'serve', 'underline', 'Kiarostami', 'intentions', 'Certified', 'Copy', 'Binoche', 'role', 'actress', 'peak', 'talents', 'fully', 'inhabiting', 'moment', 'so', 'suspicion', 'narrative', 'absolutely', 'real', 'not', 'dissipate.Kiarostami', 'suggest', 'hint', 'finally', 'perspective', 'suspect', 'must', 'be', 'true', 'end', 'result', 'hardly', 'answers', 'Miller', 'ideas', 'always', 'populate', 'discussion', 'generating', 'debates', 'drawing', 'out', 'emotions', 'expansion', 'personal', 'begins', 'add', 'gravity', 'playfulness', 'reconsideration', 'Kiarostami', 'cast', 'crew', 'achieve', 'deep', 'sense', 'truth', 'kind', 'emotional', 'realism', 'only', 'rings', 'more', 'clearly', 'settle', 'conclusion', 'Rarely', 'do', 'come', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'challenge', 'fresh', 'idea', 'quiet', 'revelation', 'very', 'suddenly', 'hoped', 'would', 'disappear', 'screen', 'intellectualism']",Certified Copy

I love it that one gave it five stars and the other gave it one star. I believe those are the only two honest responses to it. Depending on your point of view, it's either a masterpiece or it's some sort of hoax.A female character called ""Her"" in the credits (Juliette Binoche) finagles a meeting with James Miller (William Shimell), a British author who has written a book arguing that one's subjective response to art is what gives it value. It doesn't matter if the art is a forgery or an original or a Coca-Cola sign: if you respond to it, it's art. (I am doing a fair amount of damage to his theory for the sake of brevity.)Binoche and the author go for a drive in Tuscany, having a sort of ""first date"" conversation. When they arrive at a cafe, Miller excuses himself to take a phone call outside. The waitress addresses Binoche, saying she can tell Miller is a ""good husband."" Instead of correcting her, Binoche plays along, inventing an elaborate history for her and her ""husband."" When Miller returns, Binoche fills him in on the details of their sham marriage. There seems to be a period when they both play at being married.Then, the marriage becomes very real, indeed. Binoche becomes emotional at Miller's extended absences from her and their son. He defends himself, not very successfully. The remainder of the film is a domestic drama between two characters with an actual shared history.It may be the most daring narrative pivot since Bill Pullman woke up as Balthazar Getty inLost Highway.Back to the original point: is CERTIFIED COPY a masterpiece or a hoax? Well. It's a movie about art, and whether a forgery can have as much subjective value as an original. The film, then, is both original and forged. Which part is which? Does it matter?(Well-played cameo by Jean-Claude Carri&egrave;re, best known as the co-screenwriter of Bunuel's four final films. He's the chap at the fountain who gives marital advice to Miller.)",5,A Brilliant Forgery,1325462400,"01 2, 2012",2012,2014,"['write', 'are', 'two', 'other', 'customer', 'reviews', 'CERTIFIED', 'COPY', 'love', 'one', 'gave', 'five', 'stars', 'other', 'gave', 'one', 'star', 'believe', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'honest', 'responses', 'Depending', 'point', 'view', 'masterpiece', 'sort', 'hoax.A', 'female', 'character', 'called', 'credits', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'meeting', 'James', 'Miller', 'William', 'Shimell', 'British', 'author', 'who', 'written', 'book', 'arguing', 'one', 'subjective', 'response', 'art', 'what', 'value', ""n't"", 'matter', 'art', 'forgery', 'original', 'Coca-Cola', 'sign', 'respond', 'art', 'am', 'doing', 'fair', 'amount', 'damage', 'theory', 'sake', 'brevity', 'Binoche', 'author', 'go', 'drive', 'Tuscany', 'having', 'sort', 'first', 'date', 'conversation', 'When', 'arrive', 'cafe', 'Miller', 'take', 'phone', 'call', 'waitress', 'Binoche', 'saying', 'can', 'tell', 'Miller', 'good', 'husband', 'Instead', 'correcting', 'Binoche', 'along', 'inventing', 'elaborate', 'history', 'husband', 'When', 'Miller', 'Binoche', 'details', 'sham', 'marriage', 'be', 'period', 'when', 'play', 'being', 'married.Then', 'marriage', 'very', 'real', 'indeed', 'Binoche', 'emotional', 'Miller', 'extended', 'absences', 'son', 'not', 'very', 'successfully', 'remainder', 'film', 'domestic', 'drama', 'two', 'characters', 'actual', 'shared', 'history.It', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'daring', 'narrative', 'pivot', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'woke', 'up', 'Balthazar', 'Getty', 'inLost', 'Highway.Back', 'original', 'point', 'CERTIFIED', 'COPY', 'masterpiece', 'hoax', 'Well', 'movie', 'art', 'forgery', 'can', 'have', 'as', 'much', 'subjective', 'value', 'original', 'film', 'then', 'original', 'forged', 'Which', 'part', 'matter', 'Well-played', 'cameo', 'Jean-Claude', 'Carri', 'egrave', 're', 'best', 'known', 'co-screenwriter', 'Bunuel', 'four', 'final', 'films', 'chap', 'fountain', 'who', 'marital', 'advice', 'Miller']",Certified Copy

This movie couldn't claim my attention in the first requisite 10-20 minutes that I usually give a movie... I stayed with it because of Juliette's proven track record.  Then the plot kind of threw me for a loop and piqued my interest... and soon I wanted to take that loop and tie it around my neck.  This movie is like the relationship between the two main characters... something that just didn't work and shouldn't have happened in the first place.",2,Certified Crap,1332979200,"03 29, 2012",2012,684,"[""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'movies', 'ca', ""n't"", 'claim', 'have', 'seen', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'most', 'credit', 'movies', 'do', 'finally', 'have', 'come', 'one', 'made', 'want', 'open', 'up', 'vein', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'claim', 'attention', 'first', 'requisite', '10-20', 'minutes', 'usually', 'give', 'movie', 'stayed', 'Juliette', 'proven', 'track', 'record', 'Then', 'plot', 'kind', 'threw', 'loop', 'piqued', 'interest', 'soon', 'wanted', 'take', 'loop', 'tie', 'neck', 'movie', 'relationship', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'something', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'happened', 'first', 'place']",Certified Copy
