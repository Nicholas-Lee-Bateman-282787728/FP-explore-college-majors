328808,A12P84EGJD4JVX,6302717353,Edith Biggar,"[1, 4]","I am a collector of many kinds of things.  One kind of things I buy are movies on VHS & DVD formats that are at least semi-historical.  There is a special segment of my collection that contains Hallmark Hall of Fame movies.  This movie is a Hallmark Hall of Fame production, although there is ABSOLUTELY NO INDICATION OF THIS FACT!  All product logos are MGM/UA Home Video.  There was a time that Hallmark Hall of Fame did not secure the distrbution rights to their movies & this is one of those titles.  There is also a wonderful book available for true fans of HHofF productions; it is entitled ""UCLA FILM AND TELEVISION ARCHIVE presents Hllmark Hall of Fame 50 The FIRST FIFTY YEARS.""  This book was published in 2001, because th first vidoe presentation of Hallmark Hall of Fame occured in 1951 ""Anmal & the Night Visitor.""  Personally, I think an appendix edition for the next Ten Years should be written and published as well.  Hallmark generally has thee new films per season rleased, so the appendix edition would contain something near 30 additional titles.I have given this movie three stars because I did not feel it was one of HHofF's better films.  There are certsin standards that designate a HHofF movie's excellence.  The first thing that is required for a HHOfF movie to be excellent is a good story.  HHofF has made many films set in the world War Two era & this is one.  This is the story of one man snatched off the streets of occupied Paris in 1941 & imprisioned by the Nazis.  The Nazis did this, true enough.  Shortly after finding himself in prison & no means of escape, a Nazi officer comes into the cell he shares with a number of other men similary plucked off the streets.  That officer tells the inmates that a high-ranking Nazi officer was killed as well as young woman on a bicycle.  That the young woman was killed was of no consequence.  But that high raking offcer was killed, well one in every ten men in that cell was going to be executed the following morning.  The officer says ""you will pick who will die & who will live.""  One prisoner has some paper & a pencil & they draw lots.  Those who draw a peice of paper with a X on it will die.  Those whose paper has nothing on it will live.  Okay, I'll grant you, that is a good story.  The leading character - Jean Louis Chavel - is a man of some wealth.  He owns a large house somewhere outside of Paris that he & servants alone occupy.  He draws a X paper he pulls from a shoe.  He tries to find someone who will take his place to die in excahnge for his property & money.  One inmate Michel Manget, played by Timothy Watson accepts his offer, so that his sister & infirmed mother would have a nice place to live.  A hand-wrtten will, witnessed by two of the inmates ""seals the deal"".  At one point, Chavel tries to back out of the deal, but Manget refuses & goes to his death the following day.  The inmates have a couple of windows from which they can see the executions happen.  Three years later, the occupation ends & Chavel walks out of prison with a full beard & somewhat skinnier.  He gets back to his house & rings the doorbell.  Manget's sister Therese, played by Kristen Scott Thomas answers the door.  Chavel hides his identity & she allows him to enter the house, have a meal with her & her mother & an offer of employment as a handiman wound the house - not knowing he is the man who's life was traded for her brother's.  A friendship forms between Chavel & Therese & eventually the house is brought back to life again.  An imposter, played by Derek Jacobi rings the doorbell of the house during a driving rainstorm.  He claims to be Chavel, although the real Chavel is already there, but Therese doesn't know that.  Therese allows him to enter the house too.  Who he actually is, I can't seem to figure out, but he had something to do with the imprisonment of her brother.  He proceeds to tell Therese lies about how her brother died, which are completely different from what actually happened.  The real Chavel actually witnessed her brother's execution.  In the story the mother's heart is failing & Chavel is sent to summon the priest to adminster last rights.  The imposter leaves, but returns after seeing a sign on the towns's bill board advertising his status a collaborator for the Nazis. a gun battle ensues in the house between the imposter & Chavel.  What happens next?  You'll just have to watch the movie & draw your own conclusions.Other things that mark a good HHofF film for me are lack of swearing, lack of bloodshed, lack of overt sexuality, good sceanery.  These all are also present in this film.  HHofF movies are also editted to run in a two-hour time slot with commercial breaks.  This film is also that.  Anthony Hopkins & Kristen Scott Thomas are excellent actors, with good reputations.  I don't absolutely love all HHofF movies & this is one I don't absolutely love, I just liked it.  Others may absolutely love this movie.  Would I recommend it to others? Yes, I think I would - especially if they are a fan of movies set duing the World Wars eras.  Some of the other WWII movies Hallmark has doe that I have enjoyed are: One Against the Wind, An American Story, The Summer of Ben Tyler,In Love and War, and The Lost Valentime.  There is other that has aspects set in WWII -Decoration Day.  These other titles I would recommend more highly than this film.  Different strokes for different folks is the old saying.",3,"In time of war, can you buy your life with money & property?",1310083200,"07 8, 2011",2011,5444,"['am', 'collector', 'many', 'kinds',

328810,A3KH33B2SLNK37,6302717353,p89jjy717,"[0, 2]","Sick & Stupid Score: 0/6*A made for television movie, ""The Tenth Man"" is a film adaption of a novel by the same name, written by Graham Greene.  The acting, directing, and cinematography are all up to standards.  Some of the location shots are very good.However, all the characters speak English with proper British accents, which is a little unsettling since all the characters are supposed to be French or German.  Anthony Hopkins, in the lead role, is not a very convincing Frenchman, but he is Anthony Hopkins after all, and is therefore a very convincing actor.  Ironically, Kristin Scott Thomas, in the lead female role, speaks French fluently in real life, but she is not allowed even a hint of a French accent in the movie.  So the viewer often thinks he is in England rather than in France circa 1941, which tends to detract from the authenticity of the film.The story line shows great promise at the outset of the film but tends to deteriorate as time goes by, becoming more and more convoluted and less and less plausible until finally the story is utterly unconvincing.Bizarre things happen during wartime, and one man paying another man to die in his place is not all that far fetched.  That is how the story begins.  Hopkins' character is a rich attorney who is to be executed in the morning.  He signs over all his money and property to another prisoner who has agreed to take his place.  The prisoner, a poor man, leaves all of his new-found wealth to his equally poor mother and sister.Here we have the makings of a typically French existential drama in the tradition of Camus or Gide.  Besides the concept of money cheating death, or buying life, how are the various people affected by this weird ""deal,"" as it is called?  The attorney will live but will be penniless, and the mother and sister will be rich but will have lost a son and brother.  Is anyone to blame for this situation?  Is there anything that can or should be done to justify what happened?  Such questions are only superficially addressed in the story.Rather, after his release from prison, Hopkins' attorney character returns to the estate that he had bartered away in exchange for his life and strikes up a relationship with the sister (Kristin Scott Thomas) of the man who died in his place.  Of course, Hopkins does not admit to who he is, and the sister, of course, is looking to avenge her brother's death, and relieve herself of a deep-seated hatred, by killing the man who paid her brother to die.That is very far fetched.  And the story gets much more far fetched when a second man appears claiming to be the attorney who did the prison ""deal"" that caused the brother's death.  That is, we now have one man pretending to be another man, while a second man is pretending to be the first man.  So the first man admits that he is actually the man the second man is pretending to be.  Hmm.  Who is a confused sister supposed to hate and kill?__________________* The Sick & Stupid Score ranks movies from zero to ten in each category.

328814,AR1T36GLLAFFX,6302717353,Scott FS,"[7, 9]","Superb acting from Anthony Hopkins, Kristen Scott Thomas, and Derek Jacobi make the story of a devil's bargain believable and come to life.Based upon a short story by Graham Greene, The Tenth Man is about a group of French citizens rounded up the the Germans in World War II.  The Germans tell the group of thirty that they will be 'decimated', in other words, one out of every 10 prisoners will be executed.  They are to decide themselves who the three doomed men will be.  They decide to draw slips of paper; those marked with an 'X' will be the ones shot at dawn.Wealthy lawyer Jean-Louis Chavel, thrown in with the group of otherwise ordinary men, draws one of the slips.  He is accused of looking at the slip before drawing it; but it's obvious that when he draws a slip with an 'X' on it, he hadn't.  He is devastated.  He has an idea, he offers out loud 100,000 francs to anyone who will take his place.  He finds no takers, until a young man known as Janvier expresses interest in the offer.  Janvier tells Chavel that he has a mother and sister he could will the money to.  Eventually, Chavel offers up everything he has, 350,000 francs, his home, his orchard, his garden, everything to Janvier.  Janvier is sick and doesn't want to die without providing for his family.  He says that he always knew he would be rich;  and now he will die a rich man.  Papers are drawn up, for Chavel is a lawyer, giving everything to the younger man.  Janvier asks that Chavel draws up his will, giving everything to his mother and sister.  Chavel finds two witnesses, and gives the document to a prisoner who is not marked for death.  The next morning, Chavel watches through the prison window as Janvier and two others are shot by firing squad.The film cuts to three years later, as France has been liberated and the prisoners, including Chavel, have been freed.  He has been reviled in prison for being a rich man who was able to buy his life, but he walks out the prison as penniless as the most destitute of the prisoners.  He has no family to ease his way back to society.  Reduced essentially to begging, he shows up as his former house, claiming to be Charlot a prisoner who knew Michel, which was Janvier's real name.  The door is opened by Therese Mangeot, Michel's sister.  Chavel/Charlot explains that he knew of the property transfer, and that he was hungry and wanted something to eat, if it was possible.  Therese asks if he knew Chavel, he said he had. She said that she would spit in his face and kill him if he ever showed up at the home.  She expected that one day he would.  She said she and her mother had an apartment in Paris and would much rather have Michel alive than be isolated in this estate in the country.  The next day, Therese offers a job to Charlot, saying the farm is too much for her and her elderly mother.A relationship of sorts develops and grows between the two, though Chavel is always concerned that the truth might come out, and destroy their friendship, perhaps even resulting in Therese making good on her threat to kill him.  Things remain on this path, with Therese growing more and more comfortable with Charlot.A knock on the door on rainy, gloomy night changes everything, when a man claiming to be the hated Chavel shows up at the door.  It's a man named Carosse, who obviously isn't Chavel, but someone with a dark secret to conceal.The plot delves into questions of truth; which man is telling the truth, and who can Therese trust?  Carosse is armed and tells Chavel the police are after him.  Carosse tells Chavel to just leave; Carosse can 'lay low' for a night, or a few days.  This is Chavel's chance to leave while someone else appears to be the cowardly Chavel.  But that would leave Therese in the company of an armed man with a sketchy past.  And it appears that Therese is more than a bit interested in the man who made such a desperate bargain with her brother.Highly recommended.  4 and 1/2 stars.  The three actors are excellent in this short film, with every note and every moral dilemma and questionable action ringing true.

328815,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,6302717353,Stephanie De Pue,"[2, 3]","""The Tenth Man,"" is an all-star, full-color television treatment, made for the one-time prestigious American series ""Hallmark Hall of Fame."" It is based on a bleak suspenseful thriller that was, to me, for years, a puzzling anomaly in the writing career of distinguished British author Graham Greene. The underlying crime drama is only 156 pages, really novella length, yet it has his usual power, though it lacks the accreted detail I've gotten used to in his work. Still, in its 100 minutes, the film gives us an excellent picture of wartime, occupied France, and the people who had to live there; the city of Paris, and the countryside at the time. Greene's characters, as ever, are sharply drawn, and ring true to their natures.The production is set in 1944, in a German Gestapo prison in occupied France, during World War II, where 32 Frenchmen have been taken hostage. Local resistance activity causes the Germans to decide that one of every ten men - three men--must therefore meet their deaths by firing squad, but they don't care which three men. The hostages draw lots. Anthony Hopkins (The Hannibal Lecter Collection (Manhunter / The Silence of the Lambs / Hannibal)) plays Jean Louis Chevel, a lawyer and a rich man.  Chevel gets one of the marked ballots; he offers his entire fortune, and all his holdings, to the heirs of any man who will take his place.  A sickly young man Michel Mangeot, known as ""Janvier,""(played by Timothy Watson) agrees. As the Germans are driven out of France-- Paris was liberated on August 25, 1944-- and the war ends for the French, the hostages are released. Chevel, not knowing what else to do, finds his way to his hereditary estate in the country. There, as he travels under an assumed name, Chevel finds Janvier's mother, Madame Mangeot, played by Brenda Bruce, and sister Therese, played by Kristin Scott-Thomas,(Four Weddings and a Funeral;The English Patient (Miramax Collector's Edition)).  For lack of anything better to do, Chevel becomes their unpaid handyman. He falls a little in love with the sister, but realizes that mother and sister hate ""Chevel"" for taking Janvier's life. Then, suddenly, the immensely talented Derek Jacobi (I, Claudius) shows up claiming to be Chevel, when, in truth, he is a wanted collaborator and murderer on the run.  Cyril Cusack (My Left Foot (Special Edition)) plays the priest. It is a bleak tale, as noted above, much briefer and less detailed than the author's usual work, although, in this latest crisis in his life, Chevel may be considered at least to have rediscovered his humanity and his courage.The author, it turns out, amazingly enough, wrote the novella upon which this film is based, in 1944, well before VE Day, Victory in Europe Day, May 8, 1945. He wrote it as a film treatment for the Hollywood film studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, where he was under contract, along with a couple of other treatments, one of which is very clearly the germ of his remarkable novelOur Man in Havana (Penguin Classics), and the film based on it,Our Man in Havana. At any rate, both Greene and the studio forgot about the existence of these treatments and they lay in the MGM archives until 1983, when someone found them and decided to publish at least THE TENTH MAN. Greene could barely remember writing the treatment, and thought it was only a few pages: he was mightily surprised to discover it was more than 150; and, as it was determined it was to be published; he worked on cleaning it up a bit. It was published in 1985. Then, as happened with many, if not most of his works, the novella was filmed, under the same title, as a 1988 television episode for the American show, ""Hallmark Hall of Fame."" It was filmed on location in France, was directed by Jack Gold, and it got the all-star treatment.  I once caught this movie on late-night TV, and, as noted above, wondered about it for years.Greene (1904-1991), who was one of the more illustrious British writers of the 20th century, enjoyed a very long life, and a very long, distinguished, prolific writing career. Some of his writing highlights areThe Power and the Glory (Penguin Classics),The End Of The Affair, andThe Third Man. Many of his books were bestsellers; most - 56% is the percentage I've seen-- were made into movies, some more than once. He was one of the better-known Catholic converts of his time; many of his thrillers, as this one, deal with Catholic themes of guilt and redemption. He created morally complex characters, while he explored moral and theological dilemmas through psychologically astute character studies, presented in exciting dramas on the international stage.  This one is very hard to find, but worth seeing, not least for the acting, if you can.",4,Good TV Treatment of an Odd Anomaly in Greene's Career,1315526400,"09 9, 2011",2011,4727,"['Tenth', 'Man', 'all-star', 'full-color', 'television', 'treatment', 'made', 'one-time', 'prestigious', 'American', 'series', 'Hallmark', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'based', 'bleak', 'suspenseful', 'thriller', 'was', 'years', 'puzzling', 'anomaly', 'writing', 'career', 'distinguished', 'British', 'author', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'underlying', 'crime', 'drama', 'only', '156', 'pages', 'really', 'novella', 'length', 'usual', 'power', 'accreted', 'detail', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'used', 'work', 'Still', '100', 'minutes', 'film', 'excellent', 'picture', 'wartime', 'occupied', 'France', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'live', 'there', 'city', 'Paris', 'countryside', 'time', 'Greene', 'characters', 'ever', 'are', 'sharply', 'drawn', 'ring', 'true', 'natures.The', 'production', 'set', '1944', 'German', 'Gestapo', 'prison', 'occupied', 'France', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'where', '32', 'Frenchmen', 'have', 'been', 'taken', 'hostage', 'Local', 'resistance', 'activity', 'Germans', 'decide', 'one', 'ten', 'men', 'three', 'men', 'must', 'therefore', 'meet', 'deaths', 'firing', 'squad', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'three', 'men', 'hostages', 'draw', 'lots', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'Collection', 'Manhunter', '/', 'Silence', 'Lambs', '/', 'Hannibal', 'Jean', 'Louis', 'Chevel', 'lawyer', 'rich', 'man', 'Chevel', 'one', 'marked', 'ballots', 'entire', 'fortune', 'holdings', 'heirs', 'man', 'who', 'will', 'take', 'place', 'sickly', 'young', 'man', 'Michel', 'Mangeot', 'known', 'Janvier', 'played', 'Timothy', 'Watson', 'Germans', 'are', 'driven', 'France', 'Paris', 'was', 'liberated', 'August', '25', '1944', 'war', 'French', 'hostages', 'are', 'released', 'Chevel', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'else', 'do', 'finds', 'way', 'hereditary', 'estate', 'country', 'assumed', 'name', 'Chevel', 'Janvier', 'mother', 'Madame', 'Mangeot', 'played', 'Brenda', 'Bruce', 'sister', 'Therese', 'played', 'Kristin', 'Scott-Thomas', 'Four', 'Weddings', 'Funeral', 'English', 'Patient', 'Miramax', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'lack', 'anything', 'better', 'do', 'Chevel', 'unpaid', 'handyman', 'little', 'love', 'sister', 'mother', 'sister', 'hate', 'Chevel', 'taking', 'Janvier', 'life', 'Then', 'suddenly', 'immensely', 'talented', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'Claudius', 'up', 'claiming', 'be', 'Chevel', 'when', 'truth', 'wanted', 'collaborator', 'murderer', 'run', 'Cyril', 'Cusack', 'Left', 'Foot', 'Special', 'Edition', 'priest', 'bleak', 'tale', 'noted', 'much', 'briefer', 'less', 'detailed', 'author', 'usual', 'work', 'latest', 'crisis', 'life', 'Chevel', 'may', 'be', 'considered', 'least', 'have', 'rediscovered', 'humanity', 'courage.The', 'author', 'out', 'amazingly', 'enough', 'wrote', 'novella', 'film', 'based', '1944', 'well', 'VE', 'Day', 'Victory', 'Europe', 'Day', 'May', '8', '1945', 'wrote', 'film', 'treatment', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'studio', 'Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer', 'where', 'was', 'contract', 'couple', 'other', 'treatments', 'one', 'very', 'clearly', 'germ', 'remarkable', 'novelOur', 'Man', 'Havana', 'Penguin', 'Classics', 'film', 'based', 'Man', 'Havana', 'rate', 'Greene', 'studio', 'forgot', 'existence', 'treatments', 'lay', 'MGM', '1983', 'when', 'someone', 'found', 'decided', 'publish', 'least', 'THE', 'TENTH', 'MAN', 'Greene', 'could', 'barely', 'remember', 'writing', 'treatment', 'thought', 'was', 'only', 'few', 'pages', 'was', 'mightily', 'surprised', 'discover', 'was', 'more', '150', 'was', 'determined', 'was', 'be', 'published', 'worked', 'cleaning', 'up', 'bit', 'was', 'published', '1985', 'Then', 'happened', 'many', 'not', 'most', 'works', 'novella', 'was', 'filmed', 'same', 'title', '1988', 'television', 'episode', 'American', 'show', 'Hallmark', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'was', 'filmed', 'location', 'France', 'was', 'directed', 'Jack', 'Gold', 'got', 'all-star', 'treatment', 'once', 'caught', 'movie', 'late-night', 'TV', 'noted', 'wondered', 'years.Greene', '1904-1991', 'who', 'was', 'one', 'more', 'illustrious', 'British', 'writers', '20th', 'century', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'long', 'life', 'very', 'long', 'distinguished', 'prolific', 'writing', 'career', 'writing', 'highlights', 'areThe', 'Power', 'Glory', 'Penguin', 'Classics', 'End', 'Affair', 'andThe', 'Third', 'Man', 'Many', 'books', 'were', 'bestsellers', 'most', '56', '%', 'percentage', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'were', 'made', 'movies', 'more', 'once', 'was', 'one', 'better-known', 'Catholic', 'converts', 'time', 'many', 'thrillers', 'one', 'deal', 'Catholic', 'themes', 'guilt', 'redemption', 'created', 'morally', 'complex', 'characters', 'explored', 'moral', 'theological', 'dilemmas', 'psychologically', 'astute', 'character', 'studies', 'presented', 'exciting', 'dramas', 'international', 'stage', 'one', 'very', 'hard', 'find', 'worth', 'seeing', 'not', 'least', 'acting', 'can']",N/A
