1084320,A23BTLTIHMJN01,B000RXZIQQ,A. Simon,"[5, 6]","This documentary was a disappointment. Whereas we are flooded with documentaries about the Third Reich, almost nothing exists about Mussolini's Italy so I welcomed the film. First of all, the ""color"" aspect should be reworded as ""colorized"" which always looks mediocre. But, that's a minor point. Interviews with modern Italian scholars is dealt with clumsily because there is a simultaneous English translation, which is normal, except when it is done elsewhere (and efficiently) the language that is being translated is reduced so that there is no incoherent conflict. Another thing: Mussolini was wildly popular in Italy, including by the working class (and the makers of the film try to spin a Marxist class struggle to the film)---and for good reason. Whether you like it or not, prior to WWII Mussolini accomplished many great things for the country; he improved the lives of Italians (I don't have the space here, but just to name a few: he eradicated the Mafia, he wiped out malaria in Italy) . The Corporate State is completely ignored. As late as 1972, I met Italians who still sang his praises (and they were NOT Fascists!), but who said that his greatest mistake was entering the war. There are also mistakes in the film; e.g., Dr. Mallett claims that the invasion of Ethiopia was done for the purpose of defying the international order. What rubbish! Italy had been humiliated in the previous century by being the only European power to have been defeated by Africans and the Italians ever since had been itching for a rematch. Etc. It should be noted that, unlike the Nazis, the Italian Fascists almost never killed their opponents prior to the civil war. Anyway, I could go on and on, but my point is that one must be historically accurate if one is going to portray history.",3,Disappointing but better than nothing.,1303344000,"04 21, 2011",2011,1790,"['documentary', 'was', 'disappointment', 'are', 'flooded', 'documentaries', 'Third', 'Reich', 'almost', 'nothing', 'exists', 'Mussolini', 'Italy', 'so', 'welcomed', 'film', 'First', 'all', 'color', 'aspect', 'should', 'be', 'reworded', 'colorized', 'always', 'mediocre', 'minor', 'point', 'Interviews', 'modern', 'Italian', 'scholars', 'dealt', 'clumsily', 'simultaneous', 'English', 'translation', 'normal', 'when', 'done', 'elsewhere', 'efficiently', 'language', 'being', 'translated', 'reduced', 'so', 'incoherent', 'conflict', 'thing', 'Mussolini', 'was', 'wildly', 'popular', 'Italy', 'including', 'working', 'class', 'makers', 'film', 'try', 'spin', 'Marxist', 'class', 'struggle', 'film', '-and', 'good', 'reason', 'not', 'prior', 'WWII', 'Mussolini', 'accomplished', 'many', 'great', 'things', 'country', 'improved', 'lives', 'Italians', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'space', 'here', 'just', 'name', 'few', 'eradicated', 'Mafia', 'wiped', 'out', 'malaria', 'Italy', 'Corporate', 'State', 'completely', 'ignored', 'As', 'late', '1972', 'met', 'Italians', 'who', 'still', 'sang', 'praises', 'were', 'NOT', 'Fascists', 'who', 'said', 'greatest', 'mistake', 'was', 'entering', 'war', 'are', 'also', 'mistakes', 'film', 'Dr.', 'Mallett', 'invasion', 'Ethiopia', 'was', 'done', 'purpose', 'defying', 'international', 'order', 'What', 'rubbish', 'Italy', 'had', 'been', 'humiliated', 'previous', 'century', 'being', 'only', 'European', 'power', 'have', 'been', 'defeated', 'Africans', 'Italians', 'ever', 'had', 'been', 'itching', 'rematch', 'Etc', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'Nazis', 'Italian', 'Fascists', 'almost', 'never', 'killed', 'opponents', 'prior', 'civil', 'war', 'Anyway', 'could', 'go', 'point', 'one', 'must', 'be', 'historically', 'accurate', 'one', 'going', 'portray', 'history']",Italian Fascism in Color

1084323,A3P7R4SASZ9TW3,B000RXZIQQ,Old Movie Buff,"[2, 2]","For the contents of this film, please read the other reviews. They do a pretty good job describing the documentary. The purpose of me writing this review is not to go over the same material as the others, but to alert people that this is the exact same video footage as the Smithsonian Channel's show Mussolini in Color. I have been looking for this video for a long time. I even sent the Smithsonian Channel an email asking if they were going to release Mussolini in Color (Scourge of Fascism and Sword of Fascism) on DVD any time soon. They never replied and that was about two weeks ago.On a hunch, I did an online search for the distributor (Cineflix) of the Smithsonian Channel's version and I found out they were connected to this studio distributor (Shanachie). I rolled the dice and bought this version hoping it was the same thing. I was happy to find out that it was the same video footage. There is only one odd difference between the two. The narrators are different. What makes it especially odd is that they say the same exact thing, word for word. This version sounds more British (Bill Paterson narrates) while the Smithsonian Channel's version sounds more American (Stephen Buskin narrates). While I usually enjoy British narration, this is a rare exception. I enjoy listening to the Stephen Buskin narration more. Perhaps my American ears are to blame? Overall, they both do a great job so I wasn't disappointed with the version I purchased - especially since the Buskin narrated version never made it to DVD!This is the best documentary I have seen so far on Mussolini and Italian Fascism. If you like the period between the two world wars and/or World War II, you will most likely find this documentary interesting and worth your time.If you end up enjoying this film, I would also recommendThe World at War (30th Anniversary Edition)andRoad to World War II(re-release of the formerly named Between the Wars documentary).",5,"Same As Smithsonian Channel's ""Mussolini in Color"" With One Odd Difference",1374883200,"07 27, 2013",2013,1941,"['contents', 'film', 'please', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'do', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'describing', 'documentary', 'purpose', 'writing', 'review', 'not', 'go', 'same', 'material', 'others', 'alert', 'people', 'exact', 'same', 'video', 'footage', 'Smithsonian', 'Channel', 'show', 'Mussolini', 'Color', 'have', 'been', 'looking', 'video', 'long', 'time', 'even', 'sent', 'Smithsonian', 'Channel', 'email', 'asking', 'were', 'going', 'release', 'Mussolini', 'Color', 'Scourge', 'Fascism', 'Sword', 'Fascism', 'DVD', 'time', 'soon', 'never', 'replied', 'was', 'about', 'two', 'weeks', 'ago.On', 'hunch', 'did', 'online', 'search', 'distributor', 'Cineflix', 'Smithsonian', 'Channel', 'version', 'found', 'were', 'connected', 'studio', 'distributor', 'Shanachie', 'rolled', 'dice', 'bought', 'version', 'hoping', 'was', 'same', 'thing', 'was', 'happy', 'find', 'out', 'was', 'same', 'video', 'footage', 'only', 'one', 'odd', 'difference', 'two', 'narrators', 'are', 'different', 'What', 'especially', 'say', 'same', 'exact', 'thing', 'word', 'word', 'version', 'more', 'British', 'Bill', 'Paterson', 'narrates', 'Smithsonian', 'Channel', 'version', 'more', 'American', 'Stephen', 'Buskin', 'narrates', 'usually', 'enjoy', 'British', 'narration', 'rare', 'exception', 'enjoy', 'listening', 'Stephen', 'Buskin', 'narration', 'more', 'Perhaps', 'American', 'ears', 'are', 'blame', 'Overall', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'version', 'purchased', 'especially', 'Buskin', 'narrated', 'version', 'never', 'made', 'DVD', 'best', 'documentary', 'have', 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'Mussolini', 'Italian', 'Fascism', 'like', 'period', 'two', 'world', 'wars', 'and/or', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'find', 'documentary', 'interesting', 'time.If', 'end', 'up', 'enjoying', 'film', 'would', 'also', 'recommendThe', 'World', 'War', '30th', 'Anniversary', 'Edition', 'andRoad', 'World', 'War', 'II', 're-release', 'formerly', 'named', 'Between', 'Wars', 'documentary']",Italian Fascism in Color

I didn't know why it mattered that it was 'in color,' until I actually watched it. For some reason black and white feels very distant. A dead body in black and white film and one in color is a different thing. Seeing the old soldiers and their leaders in color was stunning to watch. It made it feel more modern. But all of that aside, this is a very informative DVD and is much more graphic than I expected. They show the footage of the fascists lining up Mussolini's brother and law and friends and shooting them all in the back. There are more dead bodies shown in this film than some can handle probably, but I think it adds to the effect. So that you see the utter horror and madness of that era.
