1367602,A3K65JH0785O7V,B003VOVW7M,"Bryce Campbell ""just another anime fan""","[11, 13]","Last Exile is about two orphaned children, Claus Valca and Lavie Head, who have a passion for flying, and they even make a living from it. During a race, a fellow pilot crashes into them and turns his mission over to them. Surprisingly, the mission has a seven star danger rating, which scares Lavie, but Claus goes through with it. However, this one mission brings them into a new kind of life, one of danger, as well as good times.The story had a very nice start and all the characters were enjoyable. In these adult years of our lives, we rarely live out our dreams, but Claus and Lavie definitely enjoy doing courier missions. Claus can be stubborn, but he always tries to help people, the best he can. Also, I actually liked how the lip syncing was right. Now, let me get this straight, the first time I saw this show was on Netflix and I enjoyed it there, but there was a big problem, which was the fact that the audio did not match what I was seeing. That kind of was a bad impression on me, but thankfully, the dub was not like this on the DVD release. Many anime also seem to only have character movement, but I saw birds flying around and even the waves of strong wind move, not something that is encountered a lot in Japanese animation. The start of the story was interesting, the DVD had better audio timing than the Netflix stream, and the movement of the wind could be seen.I cannot say that there is a whole lot I dislike, but one thing in particular did stand out as a bit annoying. That particular item is something than comes between the episodes. No, it is not the little things for commerical interruptions, which happen during the episodes. This problem occurs after every few episodes and that is the picture of a girl sitting somewhere and a thing that says, ""See You on the Next Flight."" This appears on every episode that is divisible by four on the first three discs and every three episodes on the last disc, of the four disc set. Okay, this makes sense for the old individual sets from Pioneer (now Geneon), but there are 6-7 episodes on every disc of this set. This makes absolutely no sense as the end of the DVD has not been reached on any disc, with the exception of the third disc, which contains episode 20. It's like they just took all the individual DVDs and combined them into four without doing work on anything, but making sure that audio was good. Doing this kind of thing makes people think that the end of the DVD has been reached, when it has not. However, this does not take down the quality of the show in my book, just the DVD release of it. There should not be anything that suggest the end of the DVD before the final episode of the disc.Despite the fact that it makes a person think the end of the DVD has been reached, watching this series on DVD was definitely much better than watching it on Netflix. I would recommend people try this series out. It is not for everyone, but if you like to fly, you will enjoy it more.",4,"Good Show, but not so great release",1311552000,"07 25, 2011",2011,2970,"['Last', 'Exile', 'two', 'orphaned', 'children', 'Claus', 'Valca', 'Lavie', 'Head', 'who', 'have', 'passion', 'flying', 'even', 'make', 'living', 'race', 'fellow', 'pilot', 'crashes', 'mission', 'Surprisingly', 'mission', 'seven', 'star', 'danger', 'rating', 'Lavie', 'Claus', 'However', 'one', 'mission', 'new', 'kind', 'life', 'one', 'danger', 'as', 'well', 'good', 'times.The', 'story', 'had', 'very', 'nice', 'start', 'characters', 'were', 'enjoyable', 'adult', 'years', 'lives', 'rarely', 'live', 'out', 'dreams', 'Claus', 'Lavie', 'definitely', 'enjoy', 'doing', 'courier', 'missions', 'Claus', 'can', 'be', 'stubborn', 'always', 'help', 'people', 'best', 'can', 'Also', 'actually', 'liked', 'how', 'lip', 'syncing', 'was', 'right', 'Now', 'let', 'get', 'straight', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'show', 'was', 'Netflix', 'enjoyed', 'there', 'there', 'was', 'big', 'problem', 'was', 'fact', 'audio', 'did', 'not', 'match', 'what', 'was', 'seeing', 'kind', 'was', 'bad', 'impression', 'thankfully', 'dub', 'was', 'not', 'DVD', 'release', 'Many', 'anime', 'also', 'seem', 'only', 'have', 'character', 'movement', 'saw', 'birds', 'flying', 'around', 'even', 'waves', 'strong', 'wind', 'move', 'not', 'something', 'encountered', 'lot', 'Japanese', 'animation', 'start', 'story', 'was', 'interesting', 'DVD', 'had', 'better', 'audio', 'timing', 'Netflix', 'stream', 'movement', 'wind', 'could', 'be', 'seen.I', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'whole', 'lot', 'dislike', 'one', 'thing', 'particular', 'did', 'stand', 'out', 'bit', 'annoying', 'particular', 'item', 'something', 'episodes', 'No', 'not', 'little', 'things', 'commerical', 'interruptions', 'happen', 'episodes', 'problem', 'few', 'episodes', 'picture', 'girl', 'sitting', 'somewhere', 'thing', 'See', 'Next', 'Flight', 'episode', 'divisible', 'four', 'first', 'three', 'discs', 'three', 'episodes', 'last', 'disc', 'four', 'disc', 'set', 'Okay', 'sense', 'old', 'individual', 'sets', 'Pioneer', 'now', 'Geneon', 'are', '6-7', 'episodes', 'disc', 'set', 'absolutely', 'sense', 'end', 'DVD', 'not', 'been', 'reached', 'disc', 'exception', 'third', 'disc', '20', 'just', 'took', 'individual', 'DVDs', 'combined', 'four', 'doing', 'work', 'anything', 'making', 'sure', 'audio', 'was', 'good', 'Doing', 'kind', 'thing', 'people', 'think', 'end', 'DVD', 'been', 'reached', 'when', 'not', 'However', 'not', 'take', 'down', 'quality', 'show', 'book', 'just', 'DVD', 'release', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'anything', 'suggest', 'end', 'DVD', 'final', 'episode', 'disc.Despite', 'fact', 'person', 'think', 'end', 'DVD', 'been', 'reached', 'watching', 'series', 'DVD', 'was', 'definitely', 'much', 'better', 'watching', 'Netflix', 'would', 'recommend', 'people', 'try', 'series', 'out', 'not', 'everyone', 'like', 'fly', 'will', 'enjoy', 'more']",N/A

1367604,A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B003VOVW7M,"Christopher Barrett ""Evil Corgi""","[0, 0]","Gonzo created this series for their 10th anniversary.  It is set in the future, on a distant planet (not really a spoiler - but knowing such makes the series make a LOT more sense).  In it, folks pilot vanships to deliver messages around the globe.  The Anatoray are the folks we follow.  They are at war with the Disith.  But we see early on that the conflict is being instigated and managed by The Guild.  And The Guild features my favorite group of megalomaniac villains in all anime history.  Delphine is just ROTTEN!Claus and Lavi are lifelong friends, they end up chancing upon a mysterious youth during a message run.  Against better judgement, they save the girl, Alvis and end up in a fight for their lives.  Turns out that saving Alvis was the right thing to do.  Of course now everyone is after them.  They end up getting kidnapped by pirates on board the Silvna battleship.  And so the story goes onward towards periodic confrontations with the Silvana, the Anatoray, the Disith, and The Guild.I really enjoyed the semi-steam-punk style of this series.  It bears a bit in common with northern Europe from World War One and up to the early WW2 years.  There is also a high emphasis on air travel instead of land travel.  The reason being the terrain and remoteness of settlements.There is a great bit of mystery in the series as well.  Who are the Disith?  What is in the Grand Stream?  What's on the other side of the Grand Stream?  What happened to Claus and Lavi's dads?  What is up with Dio (crazy fool)?  Could Alex Roh really be a cucumber?  (since he's always as cool as a... get it?).This is a lot of anime fun for the price.  It isn't as complex as, say, Ergo Proxy; nor is it as up front enjoyable and deep as Fullmetal Alchemist (which had twice the episodes).  Instead it is a solid, moving, and riveting anime series with a deep story, interesting characters, and lots of action and suspense.  It crosses the lines of styles, so it is tough to put it into one category.Recommended for fans of Eureka Seven, Fullmetal Alchemist, Shangri-La, Final Fantasy (though this is way better), and pretty much any steam punk or retro future anime series.  Well worth the modest asking price in my humble opinion.",5,One of the best Gonzo series ~,1292025600,"12 11, 2010",2010,2225,"['Gonzo', 'created', 'series', '10th', 'anniversary', 'set', 'future', 'distant', 'planet', 'not', 'really', 'spoiler', 'knowing', 'such', 'series', 'make', 'LOT', 'more', 'sense', 'pilot', 'vanships', 'deliver', 'messages', 'globe', 'Anatoray', 'are', 'folks', 'follow', 'are', 'war', 'Disith', 'see', 'early', 'conflict', 'being', 'instigated', 'managed', 'Guild', 'Guild', 'features', 'favorite', 'group', 'megalomaniac', 'villains', 'anime', 'history', 'Delphine', 'just', 'ROTTEN', 'Claus', 'Lavi', 'are', 'lifelong', 'friends', 'end', 'up', 'chancing', 'mysterious', 'youth', 'message', 'run', 'Against', 'better', 'judgement', 'save', 'girl', 'Alvis', 'end', 'up', 'fight', 'lives', 'out', 'saving', 'Alvis', 'was', 'right', 'thing', 'do', 'course', 'now', 'everyone', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'kidnapped', 'pirates', 'board', 'Silvna', 'battleship', 'so', 'story', 'onward', 'towards', 'periodic', 'confrontations', 'Silvana', 'Anatoray', 'Disith', 'Guild.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'semi-steam-punk', 'style', 'series', 'bit', 'common', 'northern', 'Europe', 'World', 'War', 'One', 'up', 'early', 'WW2', 'years', 'also', 'high', 'emphasis', 'air', 'travel', 'instead', 'land', 'travel', 'reason', 'being', 'terrain', 'remoteness', 'settlements.There', 'great', 'bit', 'mystery', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'Who', 'are', 'Disith', 'What', 'Grand', 'Stream', 'What', 'other', 'side', 'Grand', 'Stream', 'What', 'happened', 'Claus', 'Lavi', 'dads', 'What', 'up', 'Dio', 'crazy', 'fool', 'Could', 'Alex', 'Roh', 'really', 'be', 'cucumber', 'always', 'as', 'cool', 'get', '.This', 'lot', 'anime', 'fun', 'price', ""n't"", 'as', 'complex', 'say', 'Ergo', 'Proxy', 'up', 'front', 'enjoyable', 'deep', 'Fullmetal', 'Alchemist', 'had', 'twice', 'episodes', 'Instead', 'solid', 'moving', 'riveting', 'anime', 'series', 'deep', 'story', 'interesting', 'characters', 'lots', 'action', 'suspense', 'lines', 'styles', 'tough', 'put', 'one', 'category.Recommended', 'fans', 'Eureka', 'Seven', 'Fullmetal', 'Alchemist', 'Shangri-La', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'way', 'better', 'pretty', 'much', 'steam', 'punk', 'retro', 'future', 'anime', 'series', 'Well', 'modest', 'asking', 'price', 'humble', 'opinion']",N/A

1367608,AYRFLAT8VF732,B003VOVW7M,"DC_Fan_52 ""-Weasel!""","[0, 0]","Two nations, Anatoray and Disith have been engaged in a war for over ten years, overseen by ""the Guild,"" a technologically advanced nation serving as referee, or so it seems.Claus and Lavie are two vanship pilots in Anatoray, working as messengers. They are pulled aboard the ""Kill'em All"" Silvana, the most l fearsome airship in all of the world, to protect a mysterious child named Alvis. Their new mission will uncover the truth about their world.Jhonny Yong Bosch plays Claus, using his young boy voice (Renton from Eureka 7), and Kari Wahlgren is Lavie (Haruko from FLCL). Crispin Freeman (Togusa from GitS:S.A.C.) is Alex Rowe, captain of the Silvana. And we have Tai and Izzy from Digimon, Joshua Seth and Mona Marshal, playing the tag alongs from the Guild. It's a little distracting to hear all these voices that I recognize from someplace else, but they quickly blend into their roles. Except, Izzy and Tai. Sorry, Izzy and Tai.Overall, it's a good series with some captivating drama that I enjoyed sitting through. But there are some problems I had that prevent me from giving it a perfect score. First thing you'll notice is that the airships are CG. Not just in the action shots, every time you see a vanship, it's clearly CG even when they're parked. They don't blend the two art styles perfectly, so when they overlap, sometimes they can look awkward. It's clear they chose to animate the ships using CG to make the airship battles look better (and they succeeded), but they must have cut some corners in the animation. There's one burly mechanic who doesn't look quite right from episode to episode. The characters eyes have irises, and you can spot a few that weren't drawn right, making it look like they're looking in the wrong direction. But that might be just nitpicking.Secondly, but most damning, the Guild are terrible villains. Boring, uninteresting, boilerplate, opulent villains. They are bad guys, because they're bad guys, and they're bad guys, because they're bad guys. They are the weakest link, in this otherwise, excellent series. All of the Good Guys, really make up for these boring bad guys. I love watching them win, more than watching those guys lose.Thirdly, I don't like the drama in the middle of the series involving Tatiana. Maybe I'm reading it wrong, but I don't like what it implies. And I'm happy they dropped it a few episodes later. I might be straight up wrong though.Also, there's no extras on these DVDs at all. Not even trailers. The Menu is only ""Play All"" ""Episodes"" and ""Set Up."" Weird. Most dvds usually pack some extras like clean opening and closing song, and trailers, but here there's nothing.Even though I'm not giving it a perfect score, I did enjoy it and I do recommend it for anyone looking for some drama and airship battles.

Don't get me wrong, the story is completely unrelated and different from all of those titles, but it's got a little bit of the flavor of all of those, wrapped up into a unique Anime experience.AnimationThe animation and art style are really great.  I really loved the concept of the flying ships, and how they do battle.  The animation is really great, and the art really gets you immersed into the fictional world.Sound/picture/etc.I haven't really gotten a chance to play all of them on my surround sound system, but overall I think it's good.  I may update this later after I've re-watched all of the series.OverallIf you like steam punk, anime, high fantasy, you are really going to like this series.  The characters are really likable (I really liked the main captain of the main ship that the story is built around).  I really hope that, at some point, this is remastered and re-done on Blu-ray.  Overall, an excellent story; very much worth owning (especially for the price I got it for, ~$21.00), I highly recommend it.",5,"Steam Punk, Flying Air Ships, Great Characters, Great Series",1352419200,"11 9, 2012",2012,1663,"['watched', 'originally', 'Netflix', 'streaming', 'PS3', 'loved', 'so', 'much', 'had', 'own', 'really', 'really', 'wish', 'was', 'out', 'Blu-ray', ""'ll"", 'take', 'way', 'can', 'get', 'it.Story/UniverseThe', 'story', '2', 'kids', 'who', 'make', 'deliveries', 'van', 'ship', 'similar', 'speeder', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Episode', '6', 'flavors', 'Miyazaki', 'Porco', 'Rosso', 'flying', 'air', 'combat', 'flavors', 'Castle', 'Sky', 'Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'just', 'kind', 'gritty', 'machinery', 'slightly', 'magical', 'way', 'ships', 'are', 'powered', 'such', 'also', 'got', 'little', 'bit', 'Firefly', 'Star', 'Trek', 'vibe', 'as', 'well', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'story', 'completely', 'unrelated', 'different', 'titles', 'got', 'little', 'bit', 'flavor', 'wrapped', 'up', 'unique', 'Anime', 'experience.AnimationThe', 'animation', 'art', 'style', 'are', 'really', 'great', 'really', 'loved', 'concept', 'flying', 'ships', 'how', 'do', 'battle', 'animation', 'really', 'great', 'art', 'really', 'immersed', 'fictional', 'world.Sound/picture/etc.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'really', 'gotten', 'chance', 'play', 'surround', 'sound', 'system', 'overall', 'think', 'good', 'may', 'update', 'later', ""'ve"", 're-watched', 'series.OverallIf', 'steam', 'punk', 'anime', 'high', 'fantasy', 'are', 'really', 'going', 'like', 'series', 'characters', 'are', 'really', 'likable', 'really', 'liked', 'main', 'captain', 'main', 'ship', 'story', 'built', 'really', 'hope', 'point', 'remastered', 're-done', 'Blu-ray', 'Overall', 'excellent', 'story', 'very', 'much', 'owning', 'especially', 'price', 'got', '~', '21.00', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A

Therefore, It stands to reason that I wouldn't like this show. I stopped watching this series after four episodes because I simply never connected with any of the characters, themes, or the half baked world that gets haphazardly presented throughout. To put it simply, none of it was convincing or compelling in any way.The animation was not bad and the steam-punk designs were nice, but the CG was, when compared with other titles released around the same time, not great. The larger set piece battles were awkwardly set up, absurdly carried out, and downright painful to watch.

1367616,A3F9VH8916IA40,B003VOVW7M,Jonathan &#34;Jimmy Dean&#34; Lane: libertari...,"[4, 7]","Last Exile is one of those shows with an amazing premise, some strong characters, good action, and an interesting lore and world for a story to take place in. Anime is a genra for strong imaginations, and Last Exile has that in spades, from the world the series is set in to the weapons of war which its nations use. So why only three stars? By all appearances LE  has all the trappings of a great show, and has gathered quite the following, and for good reason. Don&#8217;t let my rating fool you, this is a good show which a lot of people will enjoy. It&#8217;s not one of those clearly overrated pieces of trash which I love to bash into (looking at you Elfen Lied) but it does have its share of flaws which, to me, held the show back considerably from living up to its full potential.The premise is quite simple, deceptively so even. There are few animes out there which have managed to grab my attention so early, yet lose it so quickly. Dusis and Anatore, two powerful superpowers who dominate what little land is left inhabitable on the planets surface, are at war. To open the series viewers are treated to a gripping opening scene of two fleets of enormous flying battle ships &#8220;sailing&#8221; side by side, as teams of worthless riflemen fire at one another from ship to ship. Right off the bat the idiocy of the politics in this world are brought to light (and I mean that as a compliment); the riflemen on board serve no useful purpose, they can&#8217;t sink the enemy ship, they are never used for boarding either, are simply forgotten about after their numbers start to dwindle. They really are not good for anything except catching bullets, yet the captains of these enormous battleships insist on sacrificing them by the hundreds in order to fulfill a sense of chivalry, and &#8220;obey the rules of war&#8221; as it were. We are thrust into the boots of one lonely foot soldier, huddling afraid in the bowls of the ship as they prepare to open the doors and march out into the line of fire. It is a truly harrowing setting that reminded me not only of the battle formations made famous by Napoleon, but also of the charges across no man&#8217;s land in WWI. The riflemen fighting all know that their chances of survival are slim, and they know how pointless their sacrifice really is, but they march into the line of fire anyway prepared to give their lives away. It presents a very antiwar message, while also treating audiences to a very beautiful battle scene. Of all the things Last Exile got right, the opening is high amongst them.Then there are our two main characters, Clause and Lavi who are two orphaned children who&#8217;ve taken up Vanship piloting as a means to support themselves  (a Vanship being a sort of airplane with anti-gravity technology of the same kind the battleships use). Of all the characters in the show, early Lavi is my favorite (and there&#8217;s a big difference between early Lavi and late Lavi). She&#8217;s a confident, strong, take charge type of characters with a very close relationship to her best friend, Clause. The reason I liked her most I guess is because out of all of them she seemed the most believable. Whereas other characters go around doing stupid things to save girls in distress Lavi early on makes it clear she wants nothing to do with the dangerous missions Clause gets them into. This may seem selfish to some, but it&#8217;s also the most realistic portrayal in the series. Why should she want to risk her life for a mission she cares nothing about, or people she&#8217;s never met? No one else seems to have a problem with doing just that, so Lavi&#8217;s reluctance stood out in stark contrast to the sometimes baffling illogical decisions some of the characters make. But more on that later.While taking part of a race in their home town Lavi and Clause unwittingly rescue a young girl name Ai (at least that was her name in the sub I watched) and become mixed in with a plot to destroy The Guild, an almost supernaturally powerful organization which controls the technology to all flight.  After an all too brief battle with a Guild starship (literally planes that look like stars) they end up on the legendary Battleship Sylivanna captioned by the personality less Captain Alex, his love struck second in command Sophia, and his head fighter pilot the emotionally unbalanced Tatiana and her (supposedly) lesbian lover. Okay, that last part isn&#8217;t really said outright, but it did give me that vibe. When Clause and Lavi deliver Ai to the Sylivanna, which was their mission from the start, Clause for some reason suddenly distrusts the crew and decides Ai needs rescuing.And this, in my opinion, is where the show starts to fall apart. See, Clause from the very beginning has no reason to think Ai is in any danger, or that she needs rescuing. In fact the Sylivanna crew just saved Ai from being killed, and were taking her on board their ship for protection. Sure, one of the men handles her kind of roughly, but he&#8217;s quickly scolded by the Captain for doing so. Despite doing exactly it was he was supposed to do, IE delivering this girl to the Sylivanna, Clause now thinks it a good idea to risk his life, and the life of his best friend, to rescue a girl he hardly knows from the very people he&#8217;d risked his life to deliver her to. For no reason.It&#8217;s these kinds of lapses in logic that really hold the show back. Characters have little to no motivation to do half of what they do (especially Clause). What&#8217;s more, their goals and what little motivations they do have are in a state of constant flux, changing from episode to episode. For instance Moran, the rifle man from the beginning of the show, decides after the opening battle to quit his job as a rifleman. This makes sense considering the dire circumstances under which we were introduced to this character. However when they make him a mechanic on the Sylivanna all he does is reminisce about the &#8220;good old days&#8221; when he served as a rifleman before actually going back to the job he&#8217;d made such a big deal about leaving.  Why does he want to go back? What is so terrible about being a mechanic on a ship where his captain doesn&#8217;t useless sacrifice his men? The people he works with are all really cool people, his commanders are descent, and there&#8217;s very little danger compared to his previous job. So what&#8217;s the problem, Moran?Now let&#8217;s use Clause as another example. First he wants to bring Ai to the Sylivanna, but then he wants to rescue her from it. Then he doesn&#8217;t want to rescue her, he wants to keep her safe. But then it&#8217;s not about keeping her safe anymore, it&#8217;s about &#8220;seeing what&#8217;s in these skies&#8221; or some other nonsense like that. What&#8217;s the end result of all this? Characters who have no idea what they are doing, why they are doing it, or what they wish to accomplish.  This is the main problem with the show.Now to touch on what the show does well. The lore and backstory to Last Exile is really quite interesting. It does a really good job in creating a mystery for the viewers to try to piece together with what little info is given us. What is Exile? What does it do? Hoe does Ai play into all this? How is it that the Guild manages to hold such a stranglehold on the world? Last Exile does not reveal too much too early, which gives us the satisfaction of piecing the mystery together as we go along. But the real treats are the battle scenes. Fleets of huge floating battleships flying through the clouds as they fire their enormous cannons at one another. The battles in this series are some of the best I&#8217;ve seen. If only the show had more battle scenes and less bipolar characters I might be able to justify a higher rating. I also found the tech to be extremely fun. It&#8217;s a steampunk show, so you already know the general idea, but they use it in such inventive ways (such as a giant listening device that acts like a sonar).The animation, though passible, is nothing to write home about. It&#8217;s really quite dull and colorless. A lot of browns, blacks, grey&#8217;s, more grey, dark grey, white, greyish brown, you get the idea. A little more color might have helped to liven things up a little bit. The music as well I found underwhelming. There are times I found the music to be quite inappropriate for the scene, in fact, and in other cases it was simply too loud. It&#8217;s not very often that the music actually manages to detract from the overall experience, but I found this the case for Last Exile.So what&#8217;s the final verdict? Though I can fully understand why people love this show so much, personally I didn&#8217;t find it to be all that impressive.  The world was interesting, the battles were awesome, and the tech was inventive, but the most important aspect of any story, the characters, just didn&#8217;t resonate with me. They were too bipolar, too wishy washy, too prone to doing dangerous things for unexplained reasons. The pacing was also quite dull; I honestly think they could have made this into a 13 episode series and it would have been the better for it. There weren&#8217;t 26 episodes worth of story to tell, so it just seemed to drag at times.Will I recommend you see it? You betcha. It&#8217;s a classic anime series which I think most fans of the genra owe it to themselves to see at least once. Will I recommend that you buy it? Well for that the answer is no, especially at the inflated prices anime DVD&#8217;s go for. It&#8217;s a good show with many high points and positives that many people will find enjoyable.  I personally didn&#8217;t, but that does not mean you will not.Replay value; medium.",3,A giant steampunk disapointment.,1362355200,"03 4, 2013",2013,9747,"['Last', 'Exile', 'one', 'shows', 'amazing',

1367623,A1RO76WBFX9XRJ,B003VOVW7M,NC,"[0, 0]","Love it, or hate it. This show has a quite large fan following and there has even been a second series done.This is not the complete series. The complete series would include the new Silver Wing episodes which just finished airing in Japan. Both have their good parts and bad. The original show sets the stage for everything, from story to the world itself.The story is not just a simple same old tried and true story. It has many branching arcs and some very tense moments with characters. The only downside of it is they try to cram too much into this series. The episodes in the second half can get a bit packed. There is also some problems with the film making when scenes seem to be cut for commercials at odd points. Perhaps this is a problem with the English version.The dub itself isn't super. You'll want to watch this in Japanese for full effect. Characters are much deeper in the native language than in English. They add to a very rich world design with a lot of grand ideas. But it won't be for everyone. Some are going to find things confusing. Especially in the second half of the show.This may be the only real downside for Exile is the weakness in the second half. So much coming together at once and events happening quicker just make it seem that the story is coming off the rails. It needed more episodes to really expand smoother.Those curious about the second series, I'll give you a brief glimpse. It takes place on Earth, instead of this other world. The characters are changed with an emphasis on a mostly all female cast. The story itself is slightly better in some ways than the original. Large warship battles happen more often. But if you've seen other all female heroine anime, you know the flow of it. There are constant attempts to lay down arms and just attain peace. The strength of Silver Wing seems to wain by the end as it descends into predictability by the female cast. Really, it gets very distracting switching between dark undertones and love everyone speeches which seem to do nothing. But despite that, it is still worth a watch if only to see more of the Exile universe from a different angle.Be sure to see this series first because there are some character crossover in Silver Wing and you will appreciate it more if you know the characters from the original Last Exile.Personally, there are things I like with Exile and things I find so-so. If you are on the edge, I recommend a rental or maybe view some episodes online.

Everything from clothing, to ships, to towns, cities, mountains and clouds are visually compelling.The characters are all memorable from the Silvana's maintenance crew all the way up the Alex the enigmatic and vindictive captain. Klaus and Lavi make for a wonderful duo as Klaus' kind, even-keel nature mixes well with Lavi's rambunctious spunk and insecurity. And Tatiana Wisla may be one of my favorite anime characters ever (be still my heart!). There are too many to list, and each comes across as more than the sum of their 2D parts.Honestly, the only gripes that I have with the series are that (1) Dio's arc is woefully unsatisfactory given the dramatic way it is built up and developed and (2) the wrap up of the story is just a little too fast.
