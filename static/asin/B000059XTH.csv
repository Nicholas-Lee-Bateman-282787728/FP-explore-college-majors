575129,A1RGN7M6P3HI98,B000059XTH,A. Alfred,"[1, 2]","I'll say this.  If you watch this movie first, then read the book, you'll wonder just what the heck the author was bribed with to allow his creation to be depicted this way.  This movie fails because of the foremost problem in all book-to-movie conversions: the story speeds past your eyes as fast as cars of a freeway.  I would attribute the cause to this is obvious: books are long and  screenplays and movies have constraints of length and time.  Unfortunately, it seemed that those two factors lead to this movie's downfall.Story:  The story is like this:  boys get sick of Texas, flee to Mexico, get in trouble, fall for pretty horses.  Even with the constraints of trying to jam all the elements from the book to 2 hours, that's no excuse for the method they chose to do so.  Basically, you feel no compassion at all for the characters.  The love between Damon and Cruz's characters is unbelievable.  There was no foundation, no evolvement, no nothing.  Literally, they shared a look, rode horses together and boom! these two are in love.  And they're scenes together were so limited, it seemed so much as fake than real.  Basically, they're love developed through numerous muted scenes of them running around and playing like 12 years olds.  THAT'S IT!  And all the sudden, he's so much in love that he does what he does?!(Don't want to give away the story folks).  That's so unbelievable it would make you scratch your head a million times before you realize the ending credits were the most interesting part of the film. Damon's character seemed to have been more in love with the dang horses than with Cruz's character.  If  his actions in the movie were because of the horses, then yeah, I'd believe it.  But Cruz's ain't no horse and they got more character development than she did.Directing:  It seem Billy Bob tried to put things in the movie that only he though made sense.  Thing is, he forgot (a lot!) to clue us in two what the heck we were seeing.  There was once scene were Damon was standing  near a man.  A cut scene occurs where this man for some reason is dancing like a loon, the next he cuts to what he was normally doing.  The point?  I asked myself that question until my fingers got numb from all the rewinds.  And that basically carries for most of the film.  Fortunately they didn't over due ridiculous scenes as that.  I suppose the editor actually wanted to keep his job afterwards.  The only really good scenes in this movie were not scenes at all, but the background.  When the two leading characters at the beginning of the movie are heading through the open unclaimed lands of Texas, I really wanted to jump into the picture and yell ""YE-HAW!!""  Too bad the movie wasn't about the background.Conclusion:  The movie is rushed.  The filmmakers were stuck with trying to fit as much in as possible, only to really leave yourself with a ""what?"" expression on  your face.  I would suggest reading the book first before having it spoiled for you.  Once you compare the two I think you'd be righting your own reviews minus a few stars above your title.",2,The Only Good Actors Where the Horses,1026604800,"07 14, 2002",2002,3083,"[""'ll"", 'say', 'watch', 'movie', 'first', 'then', 'read', 'book', ""'ll"", 'wonder', 'just', 'what', 'heck', 'author', 'was', 'bribed', 'allow', 'creation', 'be', 'depicted', 'way', 'movie', 'foremost', 'problem', 'book-to-movie', 'conversions', 'story', 'speeds', 'eyes', 'fast', 'cars', 'freeway', 'would', 'attribute', 'cause', 'obvious', 'books', 'are', 'long', 'screenplays', 'movies', 'have', 'constraints', 'length', 'time', 'Unfortunately', 'seemed', 'two', 'factors', 'lead', 'movie', 'downfall.Story', 'story', 'boys', 'get', 'sick', 'Texas', 'flee', 'Mexico', 'get', 'trouble', 'fall', 'pretty', 'horses', 'Even', 'constraints', 'trying', 'jam', 'elements', 'book', '2', 'hours', 'excuse', 'method', 'chose', 'do', 'so', 'Basically', 'feel', 'compassion', 'characters', 'love', 'Damon', 'Cruz', 'characters', 'unbelievable', 'was', 'foundation', 'evolvement', 'nothing', 'Literally', 'shared', 'look', 'rode', 'horses', 'together', 'boom', 'two', 'are', 'love', ""'re"", 'scenes', 'together', 'were', 'so', 'limited', 'seemed', 'so', 'much', 'fake', 'real', 'Basically', ""'re"", 'love', 'developed', 'numerous', 'muted', 'scenes', 'running', 'around', 'playing', '12', 'years', 'olds', 'IT', 'sudden', 'so', 'much', 'love', 'what', 'Do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'story', 'folks', 'so', 'unbelievable', 'would', 'make', 'scratch', 'head', 'million', 'times', 'realize', 'ending', 'credits', 'were', 'most', 'interesting', 'part', 'film', 'Damon', 'character', 'seemed', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'love', 'dang', 'horses', 'Cruz', 'character', 'actions', 'movie', 'were', 'horses', 'then', 'yeah', ""'d"", 'believe', 'Cruz', 'ai', ""n't"", 'horse', 'got', 'more', 'character', 'development', 'did.Directing', 'seem', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'tried', 'put', 'things', 'movie', 'only', 'made', 'sense', 'Thing', 'forgot', 'lot', 'clue', 'two', 'what', 'heck', 'were', 'seeing', 'was', 'once', 'scene', 'were', 'Damon', 'was', 'standing', 'man', 'cut', 'scene', 'where', 'man', 'reason', 'dancing', 'loon', 'next', 'what', 'was', 'normally', 'doing', 'point', 'asked', 'question', 'fingers', 'got', 'numb', 'rewinds', 'basically', 'most', 'film', 'Fortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'due', 'ridiculous', 'scenes', 'suppose', 'editor', 'actually', 'wanted', 'keep', 'job', 'afterwards', 'only', 'really', 'good', 'scenes', 'movie', 'were', 'not', 'scenes', 'background', 'When', 'two', 'leading', 'characters', 'beginning', 'movie', 'are', 'heading', 'open', 'unclaimed', 'lands', 'Texas', 'really', 'wanted', 'jump', 'picture', 'yell', 'YE-HAW', 'Too', 'bad', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'background.Conclusion', 'movie', 'rushed', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'stuck', 'trying', 'fit', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'only', 'really', 'leave', 'what', 'expression', 'face', 'would', 'suggest', 'reading', 'book', 'first', 'having', 'spoiled', 'compare', 'two', 'think', ""'d"", 'be', 'righting', 'own', 'reviews', 'minus', 'few', 'stars', 'title']",N/A
575130,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B000059XTH,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[37, 39]","I don't think I will ever understand the disappointing backlash against this film.  What I witnessed was not your typical ""western"" film full of passionate love and implausible events.  Instead, what I saw was beautifully captured images, powerful acting by Damon and Thomas, a story that twisted further down a darkened rabbit hole than I was expecting, and this challenging character study that gave us a brief insight to a world that will never be seen by our eyes again.  This was not the romantic film that it was marketed as, this was not the adventure that it was marketed as, but instead it was the story of one character and the tribulations that effect him on his journey into the real world.  It is the story of a very compassionate man that sees the honest darkness of those around him and must face the consequences of his actions.  It showcases amazing acting that may be a bit disturbing for the unfamiliar eye, but to me was nothing short of brilliant.  Billy Bob successfully adapted the story from the page, but it was not the film that he wanted.  Miramax butchered this film in the marketing aspect, which ultimately hurt it overall.  I will never understand why this did not receive the praise it should have, but will never be ashamed to bring it out for friends and family to enjoy.  This film was like finding a dollar in the couch, an unexpected surprise that keeps a smile on your face the rest of the day.I have read several reviews that just completely dismantle Damon's acting in this film.  While his accent does fade in and out randomly, it is the way that he carries himself and reacts to the situations that unfold before him that really showcase the true acting ability of this star.  While I do not think that Bennifer has made the best choices to challenge his career, Damon continually proves that he has the ability to be a force in Hollywood.  This film alone proves it.  He built this beautiful chemistry between him and Cruz that teetered on fear and sorrow.  He showed his compassion towards Blevins and Lacey continually throughout the film showing that his idea of friendship was stronger than anyone expected.  His strength and will shined brightly when he was ultimately faced with death.  These are all moments where other actors would have cheapened it up and tried to fake the audience instead of showing the truth.  I thought Damon showed us honesty, he showed us a part of him that I was not expecting.  If you couldn't tell already, he really impressed me.  But yet so did everyone else in this film.  I honestly thought that the kid from Sling Blade, Lucas Black, would never work again, and I was skeptical of him in this film, but he was exceptional.  He took us away from his character in Sling Blade and built a whole new name for himself.  He took the challenges of this character and pushed them out of the television.  The same can be said for Henry Thomas that continues to impress me with his ability to capture his moments and make them so real.  Finally, Billy Bob did a great job of casting the rest of this film to bring the images and feelings of the time period to light.  I could feel the dusty world of Texas and Mexico through the smaller characters that he cast.Speaking of Billy Bob, could we not agree that these actors wouldn't have been half as good if it were not for the amazing direction behind the camera.  I wish that I could have seen his version of the film instead of the choppy Miramax version.  He has a very gifted eye, and while sometimes he takes roles that I think blur that eye, he always seems to rebound with a very riveting performance.  He is constantly experimenting with genres and styles, and this film shows that he can break traditional boundaries.  The images that he captured on film help create this darkness that surrounded our main characters.  The scene with the thunderstorm I thought was beautiful, as was the rolling Mexican landscape.  He places us into the film as more than just observers, and that is a sign of a great director.Finally, I would like to pose the question of why Grady was so infatuated with Blevins?  There were several moments during the film where he could have simply walked away from the boy, and Lacey even suggested it continually, but they always stayed with him.  I realize that a main reason may be to develop the plot, but I think there was a more symbolic meaning.  I feel that Damon connected with the boy because they had a kindred spirit.  Damon was this passive, controlled character that never really understood himself until later on in the film, while Blevins was this wild-hair that never controlled himself or thought about his decisions.  It was as if they were polar opposites, but yet they were perfectly matched.  I think Damon liked him because it was what he aspired to be.  I sometimes felt that the secondary characters were not real, and sometimes they were just imaginary images of what Damon wanted himself to be more like.  This thought created a much darker picture for me that forced this film to go deeper into my mind and be more enjoyable than I thought.Overall, I really liked this film.  While others will definitely disagree, I thought that the acting, story, and especially the direction deserved more attention that what was handed to it.Grade: ***** out of *****",5,You ain't never

575133,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B000059XTH,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[1, 1]","I guess sooner or later all film actors have to do a western, just to complete their roster. So Matt Damon has done his.Matt plays John Grady Cole, aka Bud, a young Texan who finds himself dispossessed when his grandfather dies and leaves their ranch to Bud's mother, who decides to sell it for a housing subdivision. (This is in 1947, as I recall.) So he and his buddy Lacey Rawlins (Henry Thomas) head for Mexico to hire out as cowboys. They're both sufficiently experienced and skilled to be considered top hands.Along the way they are first followed and then joined by Jimmy Blevins (Lucas Black), a cocky little guy who claims he is 16, but seems a lot younger. The horse he claims is his own was apparently stolen, and the gun he's toting was admittedly ""taken without permission."" Anyway, Bud and Lacey tolerate his going with them, with disastrous results.He has gone a separate path (I won't go into why) by the time they arrive at a huge ranch owned by Don Hector de la Rocha, who predictably has a beautiful daughter Alejandra (Penelope Cruz). Also predictably, she and John (she calls him that rather than Bud, suggesting that Lacey was using the nickname as short for ""Buddy"") fall passionately in love. Of course, being a high-born Spanish Mexican, she has a chaperone, an aunt who is sympathetic to the romance but who makes the point that in their culture, a girl's reputation (i.e., virginity) is all she has.Yes, the plot line is rather predictable, but the story is generally pretty engaging, and of course the lovers are ever so sweet, the authorities are brutal and so are the other prisoners when the three (yes, they found Jimmy Blevins in prison, and assume he's the reason they were also jailed) end up in a very grim prison.I didn't dislike the film, but then I didn't particularly like it, either, which is not the usual for me when Matt Damon is involved.

575135,A39TQ9JE76GW88,B000059XTH,"Bill Allison ""Bill Allison""","[1, 2]","Alright,  I gotta make something clear.  It's no big secret that this is a two-hour cut of a four-hour movie.  Anyone out there who read the book knows that it is nearly impossible to cover the content of the novel in two hours of film.  So Mr. Thornton did his best to do the film some justice.  This was a big challenge in itself considering the style in which the book was written.  Previously, with Sling Blade,  he was Independant and working from his own script.  Here he was working from an adaptation of a Cormac McCarthy novel by Ted Tally.  He was so intent on delivering an adaptation that did the book justice that he delivered  a four-cut.  When the studios suggested that he cut the film down (four hours is just too much for the masses to handle) he cut it down to where it was, eventually, just a shade under two-hours.I went into the theater, knowing this, and thoroughly enjoyed the film.  It had everything I could have expected from the novel and I was VERY impressed by the two leads.  Lucas Black (Sling Blade) also turned in a great performance.  Seeing this film in the theater was an experience in itself because the scenery is just, flat-out, breath-taking.  Despite what some may say,  the love story part of it was very convincing.  It felt natural and real.  The whole movie is very convincing and it deals with growing up in a realistic manner, in that, you can't always get what you want, and sometimes doing the RIGHT thing is what's most important.People who say that this film is boring are probably used to Micahael Bay type films (not that there's anything wrong with them) where everything is spelled out for them and the whole thing focuses on style rather than substance.

This movie is an excellent rendition of Cormac McCarthy's novel, and remains very, very true to the book.  The acting is nearly flawless, especially that of Matt Damon (John Grady Cole), Henry Thomas (Rawlins), and Lucas Black (Blevins). The directing was great, the scenery and landscape all very beautiful.That having been said, I must include the comment that I wish this movie had not been edited so much.  Having read the book, I could easily follow the story of the movie, and enjoyed it thoroughly.  My wife, on the other hand, has not read the novel, and was completely lost throughout despite my attempts to piece together the scattered fragments for her.This flaw (and a large one it is) makes it difficult for this movie to have widespread appeal.

575139,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B000059XTH,C. B Collins Jr.,"[2, 3]","The novel, All the Pretty Horses, by Cormac McCarthy is a superb literary work. Thus, those that love the book will be especially critical of the motion picture made from that great novel. But in all fairness, the film of All the Pretty Horses must not be compared to the novel but should be judged based upon its own merits. If this is the criteria, the film is extremely beautiful but feels rushed in all scenes that involve human interaction. An additional hour of character development would have greatly strengthened the film. That being said, the 2 hour version on this DVD is a good film and by no means a waste of time.The film is the story of a young man, who experiences a host of challenges, and emerges from these challenging experiences a far more mature and seasoned man. A young cowboy who loses his grandfather, his grandfather's ranch, his freedom, his safety, his security, his first true love, his faith in mankind, has experienced a lifetime of forces that shape or break the human character. This is the story of a young man for whom these forces builds character and maturity and so despite the terrible events portrayed in the film, is really about the endurance of the human body and human character.The story is actually more about the strength of young male friendship than it is about young lovers. The relationship between John Grady Cole (Matt Damon) and Lacey Rawlins (Henry Thomas) is put to the test repeatedly and endures beyond the last minutes of the film. Repeatedly we see in Lacey Rawlins the willingness to act in concert with Cole even if he disagrees with the actions they are taking or the motivations behind the actions.Two older adolescents meet a wild young man of less than 14 years of age that Lacey Rawlins immediately and instinctively recognizes as major trouble. This set up in the plot is often used by McCarthy and these characters on the edge are wonderful as the catalysts for trouble and crisis and challenge for the other characters.A first serious love affair can scar the heart as badly as a prison knife fight can scar the face.  This is really not a romantic love story. It is about scars - how they are inflicted, how they heal.  As one watches the move, the scars accumulate, even to the point that a judge asks a young man to drop his pants to display a scar. Life scars the body and soul, and we can let the scars fester or we can let the scars heal. When John Grady Cole goes to the home of the judge at night, it is to reveal more than the gunshot scars on this legs, it is to lance the other painful scars of commission and omission. Grady has killed a man and watched a murder. These scars are fresh but a wise old judge calmly tells him they will heal with time and it is the strength of character that determines whether the scars facilitate or hinder future life experiences.The protective attitude that Cole takes toward the wild child Blevins is a central theme and is as strong as the linkage between Frodo and Golem for Blevins is Cole's shadow in the same way that Golem is Frodo's shadow. Cole recognizes that he could have been Blevins, an impulsive runaway abused child. Thus he protects Blevins when all logic would dictate to allow Blevins to experience the consequences of his actions. Jupiter is the god that imparts wisdom through pain and lightening is his instrument. Blevins comes from a family tormented by lightening and never gaining wisdom. McCarthy is a master of these type of classical associations hidden in the structure of his storytelling art.Of all films, this one deserves a new Director's cut, expanding the film to its original intentions and depth. That is not to say that this product is bad, it is not, but a longer nuance version would only heighten the viewing experience.",4,A coming of age tale in the beautiful western US and Mexico,1254355200,"10 1, 2009",2009,3780,"['novel', 'Pretty', 'Horses', 'Cormac', 'McCarthy', 'superb', 'literary', 'work', 'Thus', 'love', 'book', 'will', 'be', 'especially', 'critical', 'motion', 'picture', 'made', 'great', 'novel', 'fairness', 'film', 'Pretty', 'Horses', 'must', 'not', 'be', 'compared', 'novel', 'should', 'be', 'judged', 'based', 'own', 'merits', 'criteria', 'film', 'extremely', 'beautiful', 'feels', 'rushed', 'scenes', 'involve', 'human', 'interaction', 'additional', 'hour', 'character', 'development', 'would', 'have', 'greatly', 'strengthened', 'film', 'being', 'said', '2', 'hour', 'version', 'DVD', 'good', 'film', 'waste', 'time.The', 'film', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'host', 'challenges', 'challenging', 'experiences', 'far', 'more', 'mature', 'seasoned', 'man', 'young', 'cowboy', 'who', 'grandfather', 'grandfather', 'ranch', 'freedom', 'safety', 'security', 'first', 'true', 'love', 'faith', 'mankind', 'experienced', 'lifetime', 'forces', 'shape', 'break', 'human', 'character', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'whom', 'forces', 'builds', 'character', 'maturity', 'so', 'terrible', 'events', 'portrayed', 'film', 'really', 'endurance', 'human', 'body', 'human', 'character.The', 'story', 'actually', 'more', 'strength', 'young', 'male', 'friendship', 'young', 'lovers', 'relationship', 'John', 'Grady', 'Cole', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Lacey', 'Rawlins', 'Henry', 'Thomas', 'put', 'test', 'repeatedly', 'last', 'minutes', 'film', 'Repeatedly', 'see', 'Lacey', 'Rawlins', 'willingness', 'act', 'concert', 'Cole', 'even', 'actions', 'are', 'taking', 'motivations', 'actions.Two', 'older', 'adolescents', 'meet', 'wild', 'young', 'man', 'less', '14', 'years', 'age', 'Lacey', 'Rawlins', 'immediately', 'instinctively', 'major', 'trouble', 'set', 'up', 'plot', 'often', 'used', 'McCarthy', 'characters', 'edge', 'are', 'wonderful', 'catalysts', 'trouble', 'crisis', 'challenge', 'other', 'characters.A', 'first', 'serious', 'affair', 'can', 'scar', 'heart', 'as', 'badly', 'prison', 'knife', 'fight', 'can', 'scar', 'face', 'really', 'not', 'romantic', 'love', 'story', 'scars', 'how', 'are', 'inflicted', 'how', 'heal', 'one', 'move', 'scars', 'accumulate', 'even', 'point', 'judge', 'young', 'man', 'drop', 'pants', 'display', 'scar', 'Life', 'body', 'soul', 'can', 'let', 'scars', 'fester', 'can', 'let', 'scars', 'heal', 'When', 'John', 'Grady', 'Cole', 'home', 'judge', 'night', 'reveal', 'more', 'gunshot', 'scars', 'legs', 'lance', 'other', 'painful', 'scars', 'commission', 'omission', 'Grady', 'killed', 'man', 'watched', 'murder', 'scars', 'are', 'fresh', 'wise', 'old', 'judge', 'calmly', 'will', 'heal', 'time', 'strength', 'character', 'scars', 'facilitate', 'hinder', 'future', 'life', 'experiences.The', 'protective', 'attitude', 'Cole', 'wild', 'child', 'Blevins', 'central', 'theme', 'as', 'strong', 'linkage', 'Frodo', 'Golem', 'Blevins', 'Cole', 'shadow', 'same', 'way', 'Golem', 'Frodo', 'shadow', 'Cole', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Blevins', 'impulsive', 'runaway', 'abused', 'child', 'Thus', 'Blevins', 'when', 'logic', 'would', 'dictate', 'allow', 'Blevins', 'experience', 'consequences', 'actions', 'Jupiter', 'god', 'wisdom', 'pain', 'lightening', 'instrument', 'Blevins', 'family', 'tormented', 'lightening', 'never', 'gaining', 'wisdom', 'McCarthy', 'master', 'type', 'classical', 'associations', 'hidden', 'structure', 'storytelling', 'art.Of', 'films', 'one', 'new', 'Director', 'cut', 'expanding', 'film', 'original', 'intentions', 'depth', 'not', 'say', 'product', 'bad', 'not', 'longer', 'nuance', 'version', 'would', 'only', 'heighten', 'viewing', 'experience']",N/A
575140,A1W5J6ATHGRS71,B000059XTH,"C. Miller ""Knitter and bookworm""","[12, 15]","In an interview on &quot;Oprah&quot;, Matt Damon said he wished he could make &quot;All the Pretty Horses&quot; forever.  To the audience, it almost seems like he did.  The film is sort of like the Energizer Bunny -- it keeps going and going and going and going and just when you think it's going to end, something else (often incoherently) happens to extend the film another ten minutes.  The running time may amount to roughly two hours, but it feels much longer.I have not read Cormac McCarthy's novel on which the film is based, but I have seen enough film adaptations to know that the transition is not always smooth.  However, I can't say who should take the blame, McCarthy or director Billy Bob Thornton, for the overlong plot or underdeveloped characters.Technically a western, the plot is not so much incoherent as it is boring.  Matt Damon and Henry Thomas play John Grady and Rawlings, two west Texas cowboys with nothing left at home, so they set off to Mexico, where a variety of complications ensue.They meet a scrappy 16-year-old named Blevins (Lucas Black) along the way.  He suggests that he did something bad to his abusive stepfather, and John Grady and Rawlins know that the beautiful horse he's riding can't be his.  But the audience never really finds out much more.  Polite people would say it adds to his mystery.  In reality, Blevins's character, like nearly every other character, is a victim of over-editing.After his horse runs off in a thunderstorm, John Grady and Rawlins help Blevins steal it back, something that comes back to haunt them.  They eventually end up working on a Mexican ranch.  John Grady meets the ranchers beautiful daughter Alejandra (played flatly by a boring Penelope Cruz) and decides he's fallen in love with her.  Basically, the relationship consists of John Grady ogling Alejandra like a piece of meat while Alejandra looks coyly at him.  You don't believe him at all when he tells her, &quot;I'll love you till the day I die,&quot; and Cruz turns what didn't have to be a thankless role into that of &quot;the love interest&quot;.Thankfully, John Grady and Rawlins are hauled off to a Mexican prison for aiding Blevins in stealing his horse before we're subjected to any more of the alleged lovers mooning over each other.  Grady and Rawlins meet up with Blevins again, who this time is accused of murdering three people.  I suppose I shouldn't give away the end, so you'll just have to find out what happens for yourself, if you manage to stay awake that long.This film seems to be a victim of too much editing and too little characterization.  The actors show a great deal of potential, but they are never given the chance to develop their characters into something interesting and worthwhile, so you ultimately do not care about them.  Furthermore, the plot is so full of holes that it obliterates any chance for consistency.Director Billy Bob Thornton has shown his ability to make offbeat, original films in the past, but he doesn't really show anything special in this film.  Perhaps a director's cut will reveal something new.To its credit, the cinematography is absolutely beautiful and the spare yet poignant soundtrack fits the setting extremely well.  It is unfortunate that the other elements (acting, directing, writing) could not be incorporated into what could have been a decent film.",2,All the Pretty ZZZZZZZZZ's,991094400,"05 29, 2001",2001,3357,"['interview', 'quot', 'Oprah', 'quot', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'said', 'wished', 'could', 'make', 'quot', 'Pretty', 'Horses', 'quot', 'forever', 'audience', 'almost', 'did', 'film', 'sort', 'Energizer', 'Bunny', 'going', 'going', 'going', 'going', 'just', 'when', 'think', 'going', 'end', 'something', 'else', 'often', 'incoherently', 'extend', 'film', 'ten', 'minutes', 'running', 'time', 'may', 'amount', 'roughly', 'two', 'hours', 'much', 'longer.I', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'Cormac', 'McCarthy', 'novel', 'film', 'based', 'have', 'seen', 'enough', 'film', 'adaptations', 'know', 'transition', 'not', 'always', 'smooth', 'However', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'who', 'should', 'take', 'blame', 'McCarthy', 'director', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'overlong', 'plot', 'underdeveloped', 'characters.Technically', 'western', 'plot', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'incoherent', 'boring', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Henry', 'Thomas', 'play', 'John', 'Grady', 'Rawlings', 'two', 'west', 'Texas', 'nothing', 'left', 'home', 'set', 'off', 'Mexico', 'where', 'variety', 'complications', 'ensue.They', 'meet', 'scrappy', '16-year-old', 'named', 'Blevins', 'Lucas', 'Black', 'way', 'did', 'something', 'bad', 'abusive', 'stepfather', 'John', 'Grady', 'Rawlins', 'know', 'beautiful', 'horse', 'riding', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'audience', 'never', 'really', 'out', 'much', 'more', 'Polite', 'people', 'would', 'say', 'mystery', 'reality', 'Blevins', 'character', 'nearly', 'other', 'character', 'victim', 'over-editing.After', 'horse', 'off', 'thunderstorm', 'John', 'Grady', 'Rawlins', 'help', 'Blevins', 'steal', 'back', 'something', 'back', 'haunt', 'eventually', 'end', 'up', 'working', 'Mexican', 'ranch', 'John', 'Grady', 'ranchers', 'beautiful', 'daughter', 'Alejandra', 'played', 'flatly', 'boring', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'fallen', 'love', 'Basically', 'relationship', 'John', 'Grady', 'ogling', 'Alejandra', 'piece', 'meat', 'Alejandra', 'coyly', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'when', 'quot', ""'ll"", 'love', 'till', 'day', 'die', 'quot', 'Cruz', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'thankless', 'role', 'quot', 'love', 'interest', 'quot', '.Thankfully', 'John', 'Grady', 'Rawlins', 'are', 'hauled', 'off', 'Mexican', 'prison', 'aiding', 'Blevins', 'stealing', 'horse', ""'re"", 'subjected', 'more', 'alleged', 'lovers', 'mooning', 'other', 'Grady', 'Rawlins', 'meet', 'up', 'Blevins', 'again', 'who', 'time', 'accused', 'murdering', 'three', 'people', 'suppose', 'should', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'end', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'manage', 'stay', 'awake', 'long.This', 'film', 'be', 'victim', 'too', 'much', 'editing', 'too', 'little', 'characterization', 'actors', 'show', 'great', 'deal', 'potential', 'are', 'never', 'given', 'chance', 'develop', 'characters', 'something', 'interesting', 'worthwhile', 'ultimately', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'Furthermore', 'plot', 'so', 'full', 'holes', 'chance', 'consistency.Director', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'shown', 'ability', 'make', 'offbeat', 'original', 'films', 'past', ""n't"", 'really', 'show', 'anything', 'special', 'film', 'Perhaps', 'director', 'cut', 'will', 'reveal', 'something', 'credit', 'cinematography', 'absolutely', 'beautiful', 'spare', 'yet', 'poignant', 'soundtrack', 'setting', 'extremely', 'well', 'unfortunate', 'other', 'elements', 'acting', 'directing', 'writing', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'incorporated', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'decent', 'film']",N/A

""a reputation is all a woman possesses.""By allowing herself to get involved with Matt Damon she angers her father and discovers that he ""can stop loving her.""The movie is filmed beautifully and these actors are great but the story is not developed with the depth necessary to flawlessly go from one scene to the next and we find ourselves wishing they would offer another version of a movie that could have been an epic.",3,It could have been a much better film,1213574400,"06 16, 2008",2008,1731,"['Pretty', 'Horses', 'movie', 'young', 'Texas', 'rancher', 'played', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'John', 'Grady', 'Cole', 'who', 'hearing', 'ranch', 'family', 'lived', 'many', 'years', 'will', 'now', 'be', 'sold', 'mother', 'out', 'find', 'ranch', 'where', 'make', 'fortune.He', 'travels', 'Mexico', 'look', 'work', 'ranch', 'friend', 'Lacey', 'Rawlings', 'played', 'Henry', 'Thomas', 'two', 'encounter', 'many', 'adventures', 'movie', 'two', 'find', 'young', 'man', 'search', 'similar', 'dream', 'allow', 'ride', 'even', 'intuition', 'not', 'best', 'interest', 'soon', 'find', 'witnessing', 'result', 'poor', 'choices', 'take', 'young', 'men', 'imprisonment', 'fights', 'murder', 'assassination', 'transform', 'idealistic', 'souls', 'rugged', 'cynical', 'individuals.At', 'scenes', 'are', 'horrible', 'cruelty', 'imprisonment', 'Mexico', 'lack', 'respect', 'law', 'add', 'tests', 'endurance', 'character.Matt', 'Damon', 'love', 'Alejandra', 'played', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'daughter', 'Mexican', 'rancher', 'where', 'finally', 'find', 'work', 'appearance', 'great', 'opportunity', 'be', 'catalyst', 'disaster', 'Alejandra', 'dares', 'go', 'tradition', 'wishes', 'family', 'forgets', 'Mexico', 'reputation', 'woman', 'allowing', 'get', 'involved', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'father', 'discovers', 'can', 'stop', 'loving', 'movie', 'filmed', 'beautifully', 'actors', 'are', 'great', 'story', 'not', 'developed', 'depth', 'necessary', 'flawlessly', 'go', 'one', 'scene', 'next', 'find', 'wishing', 'would', 'offer', 'version', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'epic']",N/A
575145,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B000059XTH,"""flickjunkie""","[0, 0]","""All the Pretty Horses"" is a director-centric piece.  It is more about Billy Bob Thornton's desire to show what a great director he is than it is about telling the story.  As is frequently the case when a director puts his creativity in the foreground, the film is diminished.  Unquestionably, the film has numerous beautiful location shots including lovely sunsets, stunning panoramas and splendid backdrops.  The digital sound on the DVD is exceptionally good.  However, it is also burdened by excessive jump cuts, annoying wide angle close ups that distort the actors' faces, and poor editing that jumps to a new scene before the previous scene is really finished.  This is all done to stylize the film, but while Thornton is busy ""styling"", the story is being shredded into a passel of tediously disconnected fragments that loses the audience.Unlike ""Sling Blade"", where Thornton was focused on the character study and stayed locked on the storyline, here he meanders around, using characters and scenes as excuses to show off his technique.  The romance, which is the strongest element of the story, is rushed and minimized.  Cole's (Matt Damon) relationship with Rocha (Ruben Blades) is glossed over.  Disjointed events whiz by.  Before the viewer has an opportunity to become acclimated to one set of circumstances, the story takes a major shift somewhere else.  There are gaps everywhere.  When Thornton reaches the logical end of the film, the final scene between John Grady Cole and Alejandra (Penelope Cruz), rather than roll credits he wanders aimlessly for another twenty minutes sending Cole on a suicide mission back to Mexico to retrieve some horses.  I understand that he was trying to condense a novel that had enough material for a miniseries, but taking four hours of material and condensing it into less than two hours by leaving gaps everywhere was not the answer.  He should have tried focusing on certain elements in their entirety rather than including incomplete versions of every element.The effect of this discontinuity is to disengage the viewer, which is why there is so much criticism of this film being lovely but boring.  I must agree with this sentiment.  While I can appreciate the beauty of the photography, the story is rendered uninteresting by too much directorial meddling.The acting is very good.  Matt Damon continues to show his versatility and strength as an actor with a solid performance in a different genre.  Henry Thomas continues to prove that he is more than just the kid from ""E.T. The Extraterrestrial"" by giving another strong supporting presentation.  Penelope Cruz also gives a compellingly emotional performance despite limited screen time.  Lucas Black (also from ""Sling Blade"") makes another strong showing as Blevins.This film could have been much better.  I rated it a 6/10.  Despite some gorgeous photography, it loses the viewer with its disjointed editing and poor storytelling.  It is worth seeing for the acting, but don't expect to be enthralled.",3,Another film ruined by directorial stylizing,989625600,"05 12, 2001",2001,3013,"['Pretty', 'Horses', 'director-centric', 'piece', 'more', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'desire', 'show', 'what', 'great', 'director', 'telling', 'story', 'frequently', 'case', 'when', 'director', 'creativity', 'foreground', 'film', 'diminished', 'Unquestionably', 'film', 'numerous', 'beautiful', 'location', 'shots', 'including', 'lovely', 'sunsets', 'stunning', 'panoramas', 'splendid', 'backdrops', 'digital', 'sound', 'DVD', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'However', 'also', 'burdened', 'excessive', 'jump', 'cuts', 'annoying', 'wide', 'angle', 'close', 'ups', 'distort', 'actors', 'poor', 'editing', 'new', 'scene', 'previous', 'scene', 'really', 'finished', 'done', 'stylize', 'film', 'Thornton', 'busy', 'styling', 'story', 'being', 'shredded', 'passel', 'tediously', 'disconnected', 'fragments', 'audience.Unlike', 'Sling', 'Blade', 'where', 'Thornton', 'was', 'focused', 'character', 'study', 'stayed', 'locked', 'storyline', 'here', 'around', 'using', 'characters', 'scenes', 'excuses', 'show', 'off', 'technique', 'romance', 'strongest', 'element', 'story', 'rushed', 'minimized', 'Cole', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'relationship', 'Rocha', 'Ruben', 'Blades', 'glossed', 'Disjointed', 'events', 'whiz', 'viewer', 'opportunity', 'become', 'acclimated', 'one', 'set', 'circumstances', 'story', 'major', 'shift', 'somewhere', 'else', 'are', 'gaps', 'everywhere', 'When', 'Thornton', 'logical', 'end', 'film', 'final', 'scene', 'John', 'Grady', 'Cole', 'Alejandra', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'rather', 'roll', 'credits', 'aimlessly', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'sending', 'Cole', 'suicide', 'mission', 'back', 'Mexico', 'retrieve', 'horses', 'understand', 'was', 'trying', 'condense', 'novel', 'had', 'enough', 'material', 'miniseries', 'taking', 'four', 'hours', 'material', 'condensing', 'less', 'two', 'hours', 'leaving', 'gaps', 'everywhere', 'was', 'not', 'answer', 'should', 'have', 'tried', 'focusing', 'certain', 'elements', 'entirety', 'rather', 'including', 'incomplete', 'versions', 'element.The', 'effect', 'discontinuity', 'disengage', 'viewer', 'why', 'so', 'much', 'criticism', 'film', 'being', 'lovely', 'boring', 'must', 'agree', 'sentiment', 'can', 'appreciate', 'beauty', 'photography', 'story', 'rendered', 'uninteresting', 'too', 'much', 'directorial', 'meddling.The', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'show', 'versatility', 'strength', 'actor', 'solid', 'performance', 'different', 'genre', 'Henry', 'Thomas', 'prove', 'more', 'just', 'kid', 'E.T', 'Extraterrestrial', 'giving', 'strong', 'supporting', 'presentation', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'also', 'compellingly', 'emotional', 'performance', 'limited', 'screen', 'time', 'Lucas', 'Black', 'also', 'Sling', 'Blade', 'strong', 'showing', 'Blevins.This', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'rated', '6/10', 'gorgeous', 'photography', 'viewer', 'disjointed', 'editing', 'poor', 'storytelling', 'worth', 'seeing', 'acting', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'enthralled']",N/A
575146,APASOUCF2UD42,B000059XTH,Greg Curtis,"[1, 1]","All the Pretty Horses, adapted from the novel by Cormac McCarthy, follows the tale of a young Texas rancher who sets out for Mexico to find adventure. Though promoted as a love story, this serious coming-of-age drama offers more than the usual &quot;boy-meets-girl&quot; plot.Despite the fact that the protagonist of the novel is only 16, the casting is excellent. Matt Damon plays the lead character of John Grady Cole and, although he is convincing, it is not the role of a lifetime. Henry Thomas shines in the supporting role of John's friend, Rawlins, who accompanies him on the epic journey. Along the way, they are joined by Blevins, a young boy played by Lucas Black (Sling Blade) with perhaps a secret or two. The weakest link is actress Penelope Cruz, who plays Cole's love interest, Alejandra; there is no chemistry whatsoever between her and Damon. The film also includes brief cameos by Sam Shepard, Robert Patrick, and Bruce Dern.Director Billy Bob Thornton has said All the Pretty Horses is the best work he'll ever do but, although his directing is adequate, it is hardly spectacular. The narrative becomes choppy at times, and fails to define Cole's motivation. Following the book closely, the film offers many unforeseen plot twists.Among the most exciting developments is a harrowing prison sequence, which captures both the fear and confusion of someone wrongly incarcerated. Further, a scene depicting Cole's attempt to tame a stallion is also notable, but is somewhat hampered by the obvious use of a stunt double.The cinematography throughout the film is breathtaking, and it's refreshing to know that there are parts of this world still unblemished by modern progress. This gives the story the look and feel of an old western.Set in 1949, just after the close of World War II and the advent of rock and roll, it is a world that Cole turns his back on. Perhaps searching for a bygone era, he looks upon the vast wilds of Mexico as a land of freedom and independence. Once can empathize with a lost soul who doesn't know where he belongs, but running away is clearly no solution. It's a shame Thornton didn't know into which genre to place his film, as it runs aimlessly from one event to another, like all the pretty horses with nowhere to go.

A simple ordinary boy from Texas decide to go to Mexico with his buddy, friend, or whatever to have some adventure, to sow their wild oats as the English used to say in Byron's times.On their way they meet with a young teenager who is running away from his stepfather. The child is unruly and uncontrollable, typical of a stepson manhandled or maybe even sexually abused. He goes his own way but he will bring them back into his own way soon enough. One of the two young men, both are working on a Mexican ranch, is noticed by the boss and he is encouraged into breaking mustangs and choosing breeding horses. But he falls in love with the daughter of that boss.The young man is told to stay away because the girl has to keep her honor, which is both virginity and reputation. No rumors must run about her. But she is a real temptress and he falls into the trap. Then hell opens its gates wide and swallows the two young men and they can meet the boy there waiting for his end, having been tortured and to be eventually shot somewhere in a desert or nearly.The two young men will be sent to the penitentiary and there you pay hefty sums or you die. Of the two the one who did not mess around with family girls will manage to go back home when the two are liberated thanks to some pull and money paid in the back of the system by the aunt of the girl who was seduced.The seducer or rather seduced young man will stay behind to recuperate their horses and he will after some dire difficulties and even more duress. But he won't recuperate the girl. So he goes back home with the horses and he goes to a judge as soon as he arrives in Texas to sort out his situation and the judge will be a fatherly understanding man and our young man will be able to ho back, first to his buddy's to bring his horse back and then ...That's a simple line but the film is well built and there is no real suspense just the witnessing of hard life, the way it is when we decide to take some back roads.

575150,A3JT3NRIAQONA4,B000059XTH,James,"[0, 0]","Look, I'm not saying the film's well documented flaws aren't there. And for many an intelligent viewer, those legitmiate flaws are enough to wreck the film.  But for those of us who are turned on by a certain brand of rural dialgoue and/or by films that set a heavy mood of honest reflection and stay in that mood from start to finish, All The Pretty Horses is rare enough and good enough to swallow up any surface objections to plot holes, structure trouble, etc.The dialogue is great without wearing its greatness on its shoulder.  Billy Bob is a great pairing with the novelist McCarthy because they both understand how to keep dialogue subdued and unassuming while fleshing out some of the most haunting themes.The lines have meter.  They're often poetic without going over the line (I'm lookin' at you, Terrence Malick).  Listen to the cadence in these lines from the opening scene, especially the middle line:""Down in Mexico, they got ranches so big, you can't ride from one end to the other in a week. It ain't all fenced in and sold off and played out. Not down there.""Or consider the poetic repetition in these two lines:(in response to ""I ain't the same as I was."")""You are inside.  Inside you are.""(Then, later:)""Don't cry, Alejandra.  Alejandra, don't cry.""And as artsy as that might look on the page, the lines are delivered very naturally by Damon, as naturally as would roll off the tongue in real conversation.And it goes on and on, the poetic, but unassuming dialogue.  It's masterfully written and executed in this respect.  The same goes for the down-home quality of the dialgue.  Without drifting into pure fable, or over-precious Southern Culture, exchanges like ""Where'd you get a gun like that?"" ""At the gettin' place."" haunt rather than just amuse.  All this is accomplished by restraint in the writing and in the acting.As for the mood, I bought the dreamlike qualities of the movie hook, line, and sinker, though I can sense how some would roll their eyes.  The bizarre prison scene where the prisoner is singing, the mocking Spanish dance the Mexican ranch hand does while Cole is on the phone with Alejandra, etc - those touches of surrealism were right up my alley.  They're all the more effective that they are sparse in the film.As for the common complaint that the love affair is empty, I can go along up to a point.  It's based on instant chemistry, and the pair treat the relationship carelessly.  But those two facts go together: an animalistic love affair is going to be treated foolishly.  That doesn't make the love completely shallow.  Sometimes that's how we fall in love and it can be irresistible.  I don't think falling for Penelope Cruz across a crowded room or ranch is much of a stretch.  My lady friends tell me the same is true for Matt Damon.  It's not the noblest kind of love, but it's plenty powerful.  Cole's and Alejandra's nobler impulses do take over at natural points and foil the affair.

The love story - Matt Damon falls madly in love with the alluring Penelope Cruz - fizzles. Damon acts like he's never kissed a girl before. Cruz looks bored by her pretty boy co star. The remaining sub plots involving family honor, betrayal, prejudice and cowboys also don't add up to much. Throughout the film, it's obvious certain scenes are missing, which they are. In turn, it's hard to get fired up about a film that arrives with two hours of deleted footage. Damon tries hard to inject life into this directionless mess, but fails.

And I thought, &quot;Matt damon is a pretty good actor maybe he will make the film interesting.&quot;  Matt Damon could not save this film, neither could Penelope Cruz or any of the actors.  The problem with it is the story.  Some of the parts in the film seemed so unrelated and random.  Like, for instance, there is a scene where Matt's character is mourning the death of his father in the beginning of the movie.  He is talking about who is going to take over the farm or something and then nothing happens.  He just travels down to Mexico to be a cowboy.  And the love affair between Penelope and Damon's characters is boring and uninspired.  Before they actually &quot;hooked up&quot; all they did was exchange a couple of glances at eachother.  There is no build-up to their affair they just decide to hook-up.  This film is full of these actions that have no motive behind them.  For this reason the film is hard to get into because you don't really understand the characters.  This movie is just a collection of unrelated scenes and facts thrown together in hopes of making a compelling and passionate drama film.  Unfortunately, it fails in every aspect.  I think the problem with it is the adaptation from novel to film.  The story actually had some potential but it's like every time it was getting interesting it became even more boring.

Its director, Billy Bob Thornton, and its star, Matt Damon, are also award winners. Yet the movie falls short. One reason is that it follows the novel too faithfully, and the result is a screenplay that jumps around. It cuts from one incident to another too abruptly. This technique works in a book but not in a movie. The other reason is that the movie, with its vast panoramas of the earth and sky, is one that is best seen on the big screen. Much of the impact is lost when viewed on television.Though it takes place in 1949, All the Pretty Horses is still very much a Western. Young John Grady Cole [Matt Damon] sees his world change forever when his mother decides to sell the ranch that's been in the family for generations. All Cole ever wanted to be was a rancher and a cowboy. He convinces his best friend Lacey [Henry Thomas] to go with him to Mexico to find work there. [Cole speaks fluent Spanish.] Soon after they have ridden over the border, they encounter Jimmy Blevins [Lucas Black], a teenager who is riding a horse he obviously couldn't have afforded to buy. He claims it is his, but, fearing the kid is trouble, Cole and Lacey try unsuccessfully to shake him. When Blevins' horse is stolen, they decide to help him steal it back. Afterwards, they lose track of Blevins for a while. They wind up working on a vast cattle ranch. Cole wins the approval of the owner when he proves to be an expert in breaking mustang horses. Cole also catches the eye of Alejandra [Penelope Cruz], the landowner's beautiful daughter. They fall in love, and this and other events get Cole, Lacey and Jimmy into very deep trouble.Matt Damon gives a thoughtful and nuanced performance. Though he is certainly is a star, he does not work for me as a romantic lead. His scenes with Penelope Cruz are well played, but they lack the chemistry necessary to make us believe this is a relationship the two lovers are willing to give up anything for. Lucas Black, who has worked for Billy Bob Thornton before as the young boy is Sling Blade, is exceptional as Jimmy. He reminds me of the young Leonardo Dicaprio. I hope he choses his future projects more carefully than Leo D. has lately.I wish I could give All the Pretty Horses a higher grade because it is an obvious labor of love.

This conflict is illustrated in the main characters', Penelope Cruz's ""Alejandra' and Matt Damon's ""John Grady,"" relationship.The story is also about prioritizing promises, choosing which to keep and which to break.  Both Alejandra and John make promises in their youth, promises that seem like the best solution at the time.  But the movie suggests that no matter how ""good"" or ""moral"" of a person you become, you will likely choose to break some of your promises, spoken and unspoken.  And you will be defined by what promises you keep and what promises you break.  In the film, Alejandra chooses to keep her promise to her Aunt, a promise to not see or communicate with John Grady anymore.  And Alejandro chooses to break her unspoken and spoken promises to John Grady, promises that she would love, communicate, and spend her life with him.The story also focuses on this universal question:  What do you do when you realize with certainty that your most important dream(s) will not come true?  You may not be able to achieve your own personal dreams or freedoms, but in understanding the pain involved in that concession, you may have tremendous motivation to help others achieve their dreams and freedoms.John Grady is not able to achieve his dreams with Alejandra.

I can only attribute the many negative reviews for this film to a few possibilities:  The movie is certainly not as 'complete' as the book.  As with any film-adaptation, the movie bears differences from  the book ( though it follows the main theme and plot closely ). The main differences being that scenes had to be deleted from the movie that were in the book.  Perhaps many reviewers had read the book and were disappointed by the differences.  If the movie is viewed as its own entity, I believe it stands very well by itself and is a great work of artOther reasons that I can only attribute the bad reviews to are these;  Maybe the reviewers wanted the cowboy-main characters to be wise-crack, cocky, with-an-attitude kind of guys like sutherland and harrelson in ""The Cowboy Way"" and other modern westerns.  Or, as other reviewers have said, this wasn't a predominately love-story movie, as perhaps billed.In any event, All The Pretty Horses definitely makes my list of top movies I've ever seen.  The main characters have a certain humility and quietness to their character and their way.  I imagine this is the way men who roamed the range in the 1940's probably were  -  Not like today's urban, fast-talking, slick, always having a witty in-your-face comeback, like so many protanganists in movies today.  It's refreshing to see the aforementioned humble and courageous type of character pitted against the unfairness of life.This movie is about decisions. It is about events that we don't want to happen. That we may try to prevent. And then, when these events happen, more bad fortune follows....almost as we knew it would....and it does.  This is the unfairness that is real life.  But more than unfairness, the theme of courage and holding to one's honor culminate at the end of the movie.The music is wonderful and appropriate for the western setting.  The acting is very good.  There is drama, action, the proper building of expectations and tension and then its resolution, and humorous scenes as well.  I agree that the movie could have been longer as I was wanting to watch these characters more.  But Hollywood wanted a nice, compact, 'western-romance'.....and Billy Bob, the director, wanted to tell his story of the novel on film.....the compromise that resulted was a shorter film than he wanted.

Here is a film so devoid of energy and momentum that it seems to be not a movie at all but a succession of still images fading in and out of each other at an enervating pace.  Put simply, as director, Billy Bob Thornton has made a world-class snorer out of Cormac McCarthy's best selling novel, for, indeed, rarely has an adventure story seemed so lackluster in its pacing, so inert in its narrative momentum.  The characters even seem to talk in muted whispers, as if they were afraid to violate the atmosphere of profundity that surrounds the project.All that would be fine if the film actually had something profound to say.  Unfortunately, this is a pretty shallow story filled with deeper meanings hinted at but never explored and characters who are never given the screen time to grow into fully developed people in their own right.  Matt Damon and Henry Thomas star as two Texas cowboys who head to Mexico looking for adventure and en route end up befriending a disturbed teenager, working as horse wranglers on a tycoon's ranch and even spending time in a Mexican penitentiary.  In its bare boned outlining, this plot seems rife with possibilities.  However, it is difficult to overestimate just how tediously it all plays out on screen.  For one thing, the motives for many of the characters' actions remain murky at best, partly, I feel, because the authors rarely seem to know where to best concentrate their focus for maximum clarity and effect.  The quirky and enigmatic teen, for instance, who has the potential to be the most interesting character in the story, disappears through large chunks of the film, so that poor-as-dirt Damon, in one of the oldest plot devices known to man, can play footsy with the tycoon's beautiful, dark-haired daughter.  The movie tries to imply that the rich man feels hurt and betrayed by Damon's romancing of his daughter because he has grown so fond and trusting of the young man.  Yet, we never really see that bond developing.  We are simply told it exists and are expected to react accordingly.This is the case with much of the film.  Despite the movie's near-two hour running time, we never feel like we get to know or understand any of these characters.  The landscapes are pretty, but the deadly pacing of the film destroys our interest even in THEM.  Ultimately, the film feels unformed, as if it were nothing more than a series of unrelated incidents arbitrarily strung together in a pointless slow-moving jumble.  Maybe the pretty pictures (and even the ""pretty horses"") and the charisma of Matt Damon will be enough to keep your interest at peak levels for the duration of the film.  Just be forewarned, though:  movies don't get much more soporific than ""All the Pretty Horses.""

While the movie was not completely horrible, it was definately not the type of caliber that a film based on a book so wonderful should be. Then again, tampering with a wonderful book often ends in tragedy. I should be writing a review on how wonderful the book (by Cormac McCarthy) is but you probably know that the book is usually better than the film. Some people do like this film and I say they can have their opinion but having read the book, there are several things about the film that are flawed. First of all, while Matt Damon is not a bad choice for the lead role, he is way too old. In fact all three of the main parts are too old. In the book, John Grady Cole is SIXTEEN (Matt Damon is about thirty) and Lacey Rawlins and Alejandra are both SEVENTEEN. The actors are way too old for the parts. While a beautiful young woman, Penelope Cruz conveys none of the deeper feelings Alejandra had in the book. Her eyes seemed to hold more vacancy then depth. Finally, the film which runs around two hours is hardly long enough to convey the wholeness of the 302 page novel. A movie would honestly have to be about three hours or even more to really do this well. One effort I found enjoyable though was Lucas Black's performance as Jimmy Blevins. I found him to be exactly as I imagined him to be. But alas some good performances cannot save a film so full of holes as this one.

Nollen,"[1, 2]","All right, this movie probably does not live up to the novel (which I haven't read), but then few films in the entire history of cinema have.  Literature and film are two entirely different media, one printed and verbal and the other visual and verbal (since 1927, anyway).  OK, so what I'm reviewing is what IS in the film, not what isn't.  There are some pretty large gaps in the narrative, but what remains does make sense and the film is not the boring spectacle some have suggested.  ...Now to the film: SLING BLADE this film is not, but then I think Billy Bob's earlier film is perhaps the best American film of the 1990s--at least one of the very finest.  The central performances in PRETTY HORSES--those of Damon, Thomas and Black (a superb young actor favored by Thornton)--are excellent, but, as has been mentioned, Penelope Cruz is sadly lacking in thespian talents; she's there to add some human beauty to the incredible natural vistas captured by Billy Bob's Fordian widescreen compositions.  Yes, the narrative has some problems, but visually this is one of the best-looking Westerns ever made.  In recent years, directors have not, or perhaps have not known how to, fully utilize the 2.35:1 widescreen frame.  What viewers usually get are television-like compositions sandwiched in the middle of the Cinemascope frame.  Thornton uses the wide frame brilliantly, as did John Ford and, later, Sergio Leone.  It is unfortunate that so much post-production editing was done to this film, but what remains is still a powerful and beautiful film.  The subplot involving the Blevins character is hard-hitting and well-acted by the three principles.  ...",4,What's there is actually pretty darn good,997401600,"08 10, 2001",2001,1661,"['right', 'movie', 'probably', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'novel', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'then', 'few', 'films', 'entire', 'history', 'cinema', 'have', 'Literature', 'film', 'are', 'two', 'entirely', 'different', 'media', 'one', 'printed', 'verbal', 'other', 'visual', 'verbal', '1927', 'anyway', 'OK', 'what', ""'m"", 'reviewing', 'what', 'IS', 'film', 'not', 'what', ""n't"", 'are', 'pretty', 'large', 'gaps', 'narrative', 'what', 'make', 'sense', 'film', 'not', 'boring', 'spectacle', 'have', 'suggested', 'Now', 'film', 'SLING', 'BLADE', 'film', 'not', 'then', 'think', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'earlier', 'film', 'perhaps', 'best', 'American', 'film', '1990s', 'least', 'one', 'very', 'finest', 'central', 'performances', 'PRETTY', 'HORSES', 'Damon', 'Thomas', 'Black', 'superb', 'young', 'actor', 'favored', 'Thornton', 'are', 'excellent', 'been', 'mentioned', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'sadly', 'lacking', 'thespian', 'talents', 'there', 'add', 'human', 'beauty', 'incredible', 'natural', 'vistas', 'captured', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Fordian', 'widescreen', 'compositions', 'Yes', 'narrative', 'problems', 'visually', 'one', 'best-looking', 'Westerns', 'ever', 'made', 'recent', 'years', 'directors', 'have', 'not', 'perhaps', 'have', 'not', 'known', 'how', 'fully', 'utilize', '2.35:1', 'widescreen', 'frame', 'What', 'usually', 'get', 'are', 'television-like', 'compositions', 'sandwiched', 'middle', 'Cinemascope', 'frame', 'Thornton', 'wide', 'frame', 'brilliantly', 'did', 'John', 'Ford', 'later', 'Sergio', 'Leone', 'unfortunate', 'so', 'much', 'post-production', 'editing', 'was', 'done', 'film', 'what', 'still', 'powerful', 'beautiful', 'film', 'subplot', 'involving', 'Blevins', 'character', 'hard-hitting', 'well-acted', 'three', 'principles']",N/A
575173,A20DE0ATVAET2B,B000059XTH,"Shawn ""djsaint""","[4, 5]","I first saw this film in the theater, and was very impressed with it. It was one of the few films from that year that stuck with me long after I viewed it. All The Pretty Horses was a MUCH better film than most critics and audience members gave it credit for. Here are a few reasons why:1) With lots of movies based on books, whether you have read them or not (and I have not read this one), there is a feeling that permeates the whole film that says, ""WE ARE MAKING A MOVIE ADAPTATION OF AN IMPORTANT BOOK."" You know what I mean. There's a certain reverential treatment, a feeling that the filmmakers are keeping the material at arms length. This is not so in this film. It stands completely on its own, has an immediate, gritty feel, and gives one the impression that it is the singular vision of the filmmaker.2) The performances are all excellent. Matt Damon and Lucas Black are especially impressive, but Thornton has coaxed great, understated performances from all.3) The film explores-with incredible depth and subtlety-both the emotional journey of its characters (especially Damon's and Cruz's) and the journey of a nation (particularly the West). Thornton says so much about both of these journeys with so little, from the smallest change in expression on Damon's face to the symbolic images of fences and wild horses. In many ways this is a coming-of-age story, both for the main characters and for America. Characters make difficult choices, and in doing so, they grow up and accept some difficult consequences. But like a once-wild nation that is growing up, they also leave behind some things of great value.4) The scenery, music and cinematography are beautiful.5) The actors pull of some pretty convincing regional Texas accents (I include the word ""regional"" to counter others' criticism that everyone has different accents in the film--accents vary greatly in different parts of Texas).6) The relationships between characters are facinating, and very real. The friendship between Damon and Thomas, the way Damon Protects the Blevins character, the ache of the relatinship between the Damon and Cruz characters--all these are so well-played and are given lots of air to breathe in.This movie could have been even better if Thornton had been allowed to make the 4-hour movie he wanted to make. But that said, it is a near-masterpiece, even with the chop-shop treatment it got from the studio. People who did not like this movie seem to want it to be something it's not.",4,Totally Underrated,1185926400,"08 1, 2007",2007,2485,"['first', 'saw', 'film', 'theater', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'films', 'year', 'stuck', 'long', 'viewed', 'Pretty', 'Horses', 'was', 'MUCH', 'better', 'film', 'most', 'critics', 'audience', 'members', 'gave', 'credit', 'Here', 'are', 'few', 'reasons', 'why:1', 'lots', 'movies', 'based', 'books', 'have', 'read', 'not', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'one', 'feeling', 'whole', 'film', 'WE', 'ARE', 'MAKING', 'A', 'MOVIE', 'ADAPTATION', 'AN', 'IMPORTANT', 'BOOK', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'certain', 'reverential', 'treatment', 'feeling', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'keeping', 'material', 'arms', 'length', 'not', 'so', 'film', 'completely', 'own', 'immediate', 'gritty', 'feel', 'one', 'impression', 'singular', 'vision', 'filmmaker.2', 'performances', 'are', 'excellent', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Lucas', 'Black', 'are', 'especially', 'impressive', 'Thornton', 'coaxed', 'great', 'understated', 'performances', 'all.3', 'film', 'explores-with', 'incredible', 'depth', 'subtlety-both', 'emotional', 'journey', 'characters', 'especially', 'Damon', 'Cruz', 'journey', 'nation', 'particularly', 'West', 'Thornton', 'so', 'much', 'journeys', 'so', 'little', 'smallest', 'change', 'expression', 'Damon', 'face', 'symbolic', 'images', 'fences', 'wild', 'horses', 'many', 'ways', 'coming-of-age', 'story', 'main', 'characters', 'America', 'Characters', 'make', 'difficult', 'choices', 'doing', 'so', 'grow', 'up', 'accept', 'difficult', 'consequences', 'once-wild', 'nation', 'growing', 'up', 'also', 'leave', 'things', 'great', 'value.4', 'scenery', 'music', 'cinematography', 'are', 'beautiful.5', 'actors', 'pull', 'pretty', 'convincing', 'regional', 'Texas', 'accents', 'include', 'word', 'regional', 'counter', 'others', 'criticism', 'everyone', 'different', 'accents', 'film', 'accents', 'vary', 'greatly', 'different', 'parts', 'Texas', '.6', 'relationships', 'characters', 'are', 'facinating', 'very', 'real', 'friendship', 'Damon', 'Thomas', 'way', 'Damon', 'Blevins', 'character', 'ache', 'relatinship', 'Damon', 'Cruz', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'well-played', 'are', 'given', 'lots', 'air', 'breathe', 'in.This', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'better', 'Thornton', 'had', 'been', 'allowed', 'make', '4-hour', 'movie', 'wanted', 'make', 'said', 'near-masterpiece', 'even', 'chop-shop', 'treatment', 'got', 'studio', 'People', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'movie', 'seem', 'want', 'be', 'something', 'not']",N/A
575174,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,B000059XTH,S. Schell,"[62, 68]","""It's the most fun I've ever had working on a film,"" Matt Damon gushed in one of numerous interviews for director Billy Bob Thornton's western epic, an adaptation of the novel by Cormac McCarthy that originally hit bookstore shelves back in 1992.  Sad to say, Mr. Damon, it wasn't so fun to WATCH Thornton's finished product. ""All The Pretty Horses"" is like trying to interpret someone's bad dream, all scattered images and unintelligible action thrown together in a two-hour video.  It is obvious in the first 30 minutes of ""ATPH"" that integral parts of the film were cut to fill a specific time frame. Enormous amounts of footage that would've made the film more understandable and perhaps even more enjoyable ended up on the cutting room floor due to squabbles between Thornton and studio execs.  From what would've been a potentially long film (almost four hours, to be exact) it was severely sliced down to a mere 116 minutes by the hacksaw editors at Miramax and the film suffers greatly because of it.The story is as follows: John Grady Cole (Damon) is a young man in late 1940's Texas who dreams of living the life of a prosperous rancher.  He is determined to see and experience the old frontier before it disappears for good and makes a plan to travel to Mexico on horse with his good friend Lacy Rawlins (Thomas).  On route, they meet tough-talking teen Jimmy Blevins, a young fugitive traversing the desert landscape on a stolen horse.  He leaves the entourage only days later, dodging authorities for a second-theft of the same nature.  Sans Blevins, John and Lacy cross the border and find work taming wild steeds for a man named Rocha, the most prestigious rancher in the area.  Trouble brews when good ol' John falls for Rocha's beautiful daughter Alejandra (Cruz).  Despite the tumult that their interracial relationship will cause, they begin seeing each other in secret and fall madly in love.  About fifteen minutes after John and Alejandra are officially an item (it occurs so quickly - it's almost implausible), he and Lacy are detained by the local captain for murder and meet up with Blevins again when they are thrown into a filthy cell with him after their arrest.  John and Lacy do time in a Mexican penitentiary (don't know how long; hard to tell) and Alejandra is completely out of the picture for the next hour.It's at about this point in the movie that people who have not read McCarthy's novel will be thinking, ""What's the hell's going on here?""  They have good reason to ask this question, for nothing makes sense because of Thornton's massive amount of missing footage (probably about an hour and a half's worth, if I carefully judge).  What will really boggle people is the relationship between John and Alejandra.  The dialogue between them is too insubstantial and vague; their wordless exchanges aren't nearly enough to justify their instantaneous love affair.  In a matter of minutes, John and Alejandra go from perfect strangers to voracious paramours, a tangle of limbs beneath the sheets.  You don't see any emotional growth to their relationship.  Instead, it's...BAM - they're in love!  Cruz's Alejandra is reticent one moment and in the next moment knocking on Damon's bedroom door every night for a romantic rendezvous. Even their love scenes are shown in jump cuts, each shot of them kissing and embracing only seconds long.  Fade in, fade out - and that's the way it goes.  There is no insight to gain for their sudden chemistry and their heartrending romance.  Of course, this is due to the faulty editing that is so apparent throughout the whole movie.Many other defects stand out to the ardent observer.  For example, Henry Thomas and Matt Damon look not the least bit rugged in their travails across the border.  There is not a millimeter of stubble visible on their baby faces, even after several days in the rough and unforgiving terrain of Texas and Mexico with no hygiene whatsoever, not to mention an arduous stint in a filthy and fearsome penitentiary.  They remain clean-shaven through it all. Not very realistic, if you ask me.It is hard for me to critique most of the performances in this film because of all the missing pieces, but I will say this: Lucas Black RULED the screen.  Black was the high of the lows and a welcome spark to the extensive and languorous shots of the Mexican range.  Cocksure and completely resolved to keep both his horse and gun to his minute list of possessions, Black's strong-headed Blevins is a spunky refresher when someone becomes bored with John and Lacy's dreamy trek across the border.Despite its greatest flaw, ""All The Pretty Horses"" still manages to come off as a striking and meaningful piece of work from a progressive director.  I sincerely hope that within the next year, Thornton releases a director's cut version on DVD so that audiences predisposed to shunning this insufferable edition will get a chance to see Thornton's original and complete vision before the production axe came down with a loud and deadly crack.",3,Jump Cuts and Loose Ends,988934400,"05 4, 2001",2001,5026,"['most', 'fun', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had',
