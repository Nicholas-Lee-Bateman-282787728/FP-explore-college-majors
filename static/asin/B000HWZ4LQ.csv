But for anything beyond that, it is a waste of time.  There were to pieces to this that I found rather disturbing.  First of all - the part where the boyfriend was willing to accept her no matter what he found about her past.  That there was no way that she could be a bad person or do anything that would make him change his view of her. Oookay.  Let's say (because this has happened) that she regains her memory and it just so happens that she is a mother with a husband.  All of a sudden NO MATTER WHAT HER PAST doesn't matter takes on a new light.  Of course this was a cheesy movie as I said - but there are good reasons why not to just go jumping into something without checking your own selfish reasons at the door.  Specially at a time like Christmas he should have considered that angle, not just how much HE loved her - because then, it isn't about her or her well being - it is about him.Second - the ""magic"" pen and cookie moment was unnecessary. Fine, she had magic - but why those scenes?",3,Ho Hum,1355961600,"12 20, 2012",2012,1087,"['Well', 'super', 'cheesy', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'when', 'have', 'super', 'young', 'kids', 'fine', 'anything', 'waste', 'time', 'were', 'pieces', 'found', 'rather', 'disturbing', 'First', 'part', 'where', 'boyfriend', 'was', 'willing', 'accept', 'matter', 'what', 'found', 'past', 'was', 'way', 'could', 'be', 'bad', 'person', 'do', 'anything', 'would', 'make', 'change', 'view', 'Oookay', 'Let', 'say', 'happened', 'memory', 'just', 'so', 'mother', 'husband', 'sudden', 'NO', 'MATTER', 'WHAT', 'HER', 'PAST', ""n't"", 'matter', 'new', 'light', 'course', 'was', 'cheesy', 'movie', 'said', 'are', 'good', 'reasons', 'why', 'not', 'just', 'go', 'jumping', 'something', 'checking', 'own', 'selfish', 'reasons', 'door', 'Specially', 'time', 'Christmas', 'should', 'have', 'considered', 'angle', 'not', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'HE', 'loved', 'then', ""n't"", 'well', 'being', 'him.Second', 'magic', 'pen', 'cookie', 'moment', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'Fine', 'had', 'magic', 'why', 'scenes']",Twice Upon A Christmas
