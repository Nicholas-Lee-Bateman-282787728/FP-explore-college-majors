I sat down to watch this with 2 other women, and only 2 of us made it to the end. One got up and walked away to busy herself with something else about 1/2 hour from the end, saying while cute, it was predictable.I was excited to see it because I love Jeffrey Dean Morgan. I actually think he was the best part of this movie. He was charming and funny, while Uma Thurman was annoying and Colin Firth wasn't given enough of a well rounded character or screen time to be his charismatic self. The premise is that Uma Thurman is a engaged to be married doctor who hosts a radio show giving love advice, not considering that her advice to strangers can have catastrophic effects on others peoples' lives. Also, her stand point on love switches dramatically mid-movie, yet none of her radio fans seem to notice or care despite what advice she's given in the past? I don't think so.Part way thru the movie, someone asked if this was ""straight to DVD"", which usually denotes a certain quality. Like it wasn't good enough to make any $ in the theatre. I believe it was released briefly, but didn't do so well. While 'cute', on the whole it had a predictable & thrown together premise, barely worth watching unless you're a Jeffrey Dean Morgan fan.",3,barely 3 stars.

At first, the premise seems ludicrous - why would anyone engaged to Colin Firth be happy to be married to someone else? As the circumstances of the movie unfold and one realizes that Firth is more the ""safe bet"" Mr. Darcy character he is so famous for playing, whereas the other man is the epiphany of freedom, adventure, and excitement, the answer becomes quite obvious.

In short this is neither romantic nor a comedy.  It is a damp squib of the most tedious kind. Rather than spend two hours wasting your life in front of this drab and desperately unfunny film, it would be better to go out and do almost anything else.

The script for the movie focuses too much on trying to create funny scenes and not enough on character and plot development. It's almost as if the movie expects viewers to be so acquainted with the typical romantic comedy plots that it cuts corners and jumps straight to some scenes with no buildup. If you are willing to make these mental jumps, you might like this movie. If not, it may seem kind of clunky. All three of the actors doing the main characters do a pretty nice job of acting here and in spite of a few embarrassingly dumb scenes, they shine in this movie.The plot centers around a fireman whose life is ruined when his fiancee listens to a local radio love doctor and breaks off the marriage. To get back, he has his teenage computer hacker neighbor create a fake marriage certificate that shows she is married to him. As the radio show doctor tries to get an annulment, the two have to hang out in many situations and end up finding out they enjoy each other's company. There is never really a lot of conflict between the two that you would expect in this kind of situation and it doesn't seem terribly apparent why she would leave her own fiancee, who seems like Mr. perfect, but I guess that's what has to happen in this kind of movie.

1281999,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B002OVED88,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[1, 1]","Griffin Dunne's 2008 romantic comedy, ""The Accidental Husband"" has been both praised and damned for not reinventing the genre, in some manner, but I found it charming, with it's own merits, and a terrific comic performance by Uma Thurman, an actress rather locked, these days, in action-oriented films. She is surprisingly funny, with great timing, and a welcome ability to laugh at herself without being self-conscious about it. Matched with Colin Firth's skill at finding humor in exasperation, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan's gonzo energy, the trio makes the film a very pleasant experience, and a date movie your younger siblings can enjoy, too (PG-13, with some profanity, but no nudity).The plot is pretty straightforward; Thurman is a radio 'love doctor' whose pragmatic view of romance costs fireman Morgan the love (and engagement) of his fiance. When an Indian teen neighbor (and computer geek) hacks into Thurman's personal records, Morgan sees a way to give her a taste of her own medicine, listing himself as her husband (being married, she cannot apply for a wedding licence with her publisher/longtime beau, Firth). She visits Morgan for his signature on an annulment (which he stretches out), and, naturally, over time, the mismatched pair fall in love, in a postcard-beautiful New York City...Two real pluses for the film are the superb supporting cast, and a taste of New York City's rich Indian culture (in the neighborhood where Morgan lives). Four of my favorite actors, Sam Shepard, Isabella Rossellini, Keir Dullea, and Brooke Adams, get to play comedy, for a change, and each is marvellous (particularly Rossellini, who is a dead ringer for her mother, Ingrid Bergman). The Indian 'Barmitzvah' sequence is, simply, fabulous, with an entertaining touch of 'Bollywood'!The 'Making-Of' featurette is a plus, too, with the backstory of Thurman's decade-long effort to bring the story to the screen, and funny, light-hearted observations by Dunne, Firth, Morgan, and Rosselini. Both Thurman and Morgan were injured, making the movie (she broke her wrist in a fall, he tore up his leg playing soccer), and ""Accidental"" is a too-appropriate title!Give ""The Accidental Husband"" a chance...I'm glad I did!",4,"Sweet-Natured, Entertaining Fluff, with a Winning Cast...",1278201600,"07 4, 2010",2010,2214,"['Griffin', 'Dunne', '2008', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Accidental', 'Husband', 'been', 'praised', 'damned', 'not', 'reinventing', 'genre', 'manner', 'found', 'charming', 'own', 'merits', 'terrific', 'comic', 'performance', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'actress', 'rather', 'locked', 'days', 'action-oriented', 'films', 'surprisingly', 'funny', 'great', 'timing', 'welcome', 'ability', 'laugh', 'being', 'self-conscious', 'Matched', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'skill', 'finding', 'humor', 'exasperation', 'Jeffrey', 'Dean', 'Morgan', 'gonzo', 'energy', 'trio', 'film', 'very', 'pleasant', 'experience', 'date', 'movie', 'younger', 'siblings', 'can', 'enjoy', 'too', 'PG-13', 'profanity', 'nudity', '.The', 'plot', 'pretty', 'straightforward', 'Thurman', 'radio', 'doctor', 'pragmatic', 'view', 'romance', 'costs', 'fireman', 'Morgan', 'love', 'engagement', 'fiance', 'When', 'Indian', 'teen', 'neighbor', 'computer', 'geek', 'Thurman', 'personal', 'records', 'Morgan', 'way', 'give', 'taste', 'own', 'medicine', 'listing', 'husband', 'being', 'married', 'can', 'not', 'apply', 'wedding', 'licence', 'publisher/longtime', 'beau', 'Firth', 'Morgan', 'signature', 'annulment', 'out', 'naturally', 'time', 'mismatched', 'pair', 'fall', 'love', 'postcard-beautiful', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Two', 'real', 'pluses', 'film', 'are', 'superb', 'supporting', 'cast', 'taste', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'rich', 'Indian', 'culture', 'neighborhood', 'where', 'Morgan', 'Four', 'favorite', 'actors', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'Isabella', 'Rossellini', 'Keir', 'Dullea', 'Brooke', 'Adams', 'get', 'play', 'comedy', 'change', 'marvellous', 'particularly', 'Rossellini', 'who', 'dead', 'ringer', 'mother', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'Indian', ""'Barmitzvah"", 'sequence', 'simply', 'fabulous', 'entertaining', 'touch', ""'Bollywood"", ""'Making-Of"", 'featurette', 'plus', 'too', 'backstory', 'Thurman', 'decade-long', 'effort', 'bring', 'story', 'screen', 'funny', 'light-hearted', 'observations', 'Dunne', 'Firth', 'Morgan', 'Rosselini', 'Thurman', 'Morgan', 'were', 'injured', 'making', 'movie', 'broke', 'wrist', 'fall', 'tore', 'up', 'leg', 'playing', 'soccer', 'Accidental', 'too-appropriate', 'title', 'Give', 'Accidental', 'Husband', 'chance', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did']",N/A

A refreshing take on love triangle storyline with the inclusion of South Asian pop culture mixed in.  Also, featuring a solid performance from Colin Firth and Jeffrey Dean Morgan. If you enjoy romantic comedies, give this film a chance!""The Accidental Husband"", the romantic comedy directed by actor Griffin Dunne (""Frasier"", ""After Hours"", ""Duke of Groove"") and features a screenplay by Mimi Hare, Clare Naylor and Bonnie Sikowitz (""Spin City, ""Scrubs""), music by composer Andrea Gurrera (""Dada's Dance"", ""Birdwatchers"", ""A Perfect Day"") and cinematographer William Rexer (""The Devil Came On Horseback"", ""I Think I Love My Wife"", ""Fierce People"").The film that had so much potential but unfortunately, similar to the film ""The Maiden Heist"", was shelved indefinitely after the bankruptcy of the distributor Yari Film Group before it was set to premiere in the United States.  The film did manage to get a theatrical debut in the UK.The film would be the first to showcase Uma Thurman (""Kill Bill"", ""The Avengers"", ""My Super Ex-Girlfriend"") in her first romantic comedy and star along with Colin Firth (""Easy Virtue"", ""Pride and Prejudice"", ""Bridget Jones""), Jeffrey Dean Morgan (""Grey's Anatomy"", ""Supernatural""), Sam Shepard (""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"", ""Stealth"", ""Swordfish"") and Isabella Rossellini (""Napoleon"", ""Infamous"", ""Alias"").The film revolves around Dr. Emma Lloyd (played by Uma Thurman).  A well-known radio talk show host in New York City who talks about love and relationships in her program.  She's dating Richard Bratton (played by Colin Firth) who is a publisher and the two are planning to get married.Meanwhile, Patrick Sullivan (played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is set to get married to his fiance...until his fiance has second feelings about the marriage after listening to Dr. Lloyd's radio program and realizes from calling into the show that she is not in love with him and breaks up the relationship.Patrick hears the program while driving home with his friends after a game of soccer and is shocked that his (ex) fiance really listened to Dr. Lloyd that when he get home.  So, depressed and in anger, Patrick talks to friend/young hacker to cause problems for Emma Lloyd and give her a taste of her medicine by creating a marriage certificate which says that she is married to him.So, on the day that Emma and Richard are to get their marriage license, they find out that she is married to man she has never met.  Due to the rules, the only way to take care of this is by meeting up with Patrick Sullivan and getting him to sign off on paperwork to end their ""marriage"" and then get the papers notarized.Seems simple enough but with Patrick wanting his revenge on Emma, he's determined to get close to this beautiful blonde by going to her workplace, meanwhile Emma knows she needs these papers sign and notarized so she tries to be nice with him which includes allowing him to go with her to a cake tasting for her wedding and by doing that, both Emma and Patrick must pretend that they are a couple and that is when things start to go awry.  Especially when they discover that they may have feelings for each other.VIDEO & AUDIO:""The Accidental Husband"" is a beautiful film shot in New York City.  Really beautiful shots above the New York City skyline and various areas in the city.  The film continues Yari Film Group's incorporation of Indian culture in the film and thus we see Patrick living with an Indian family, his good friend is Indian and we see the culture showcased at an Indian party that the characters attend.It was very interesting to see New York but that South Asian flair in the film and for the most part William Rexer did a fine job in getting really beautiful shots of the city.  Picture quality was nice and vibrant on DVD and is presneted in 1:85:1 Anamorphic Widescreen.As for audio, the film is presented in English 5.1 (Dolby Digital).  For the most part, the film is dialogue and music driven.  Front and center channels are clear and understandable and music plays a big part in this film.  Especially Indian music.  Overall, not a film that showcases action, so the soundtrack is quite satisfactory for the film.Subtitles are in English.SPECIAL FEATURES:""The Accidental Husband"" comes with the following special feature:* Matters of the Heart: Making-Of Featurette -  (20:40)  Interviews with the the cast and crew in regards to the making of the film.  Uma Thurman talks about getting the opportunity to play a comedic role and working with Colin Firth and Jeffrey Dean Morgan.  Griffin Dunne talks about the cast and why he cast some of the main talent and more.JUDGMENT CALL:""The Accidental Husband"" is a charming, fun and enjoyable romantic comedy.  Granted, it's not the best romantic comedy ever made but the fact that it tries to be different in showcasing the typical storyline of woman is to marry a man #1, woman meets new man #2 and finds magic with man #2 but yet knows she is getting married to man #1.  Sure, we have seen these type of films done many times before but ""The Accidental Husband"" tries to be different as it incorporates that Indian culture into the film.In a way this was quite unexpected because this is not a Bollywood film but the addition of Ajay Naidu playing the part of Deep, Patrick's best friend and Patrick living at his family's building, there is a good amount of Indian culture featured in the film and also music, despite the main characters being Caucasian.So, in some ways, there is a taste of Bollywood in this film.  Subtle but yet it gives a refreshing take to a often-used relationship storyline seen in previous romantic comedies and I enjoyed that.  Some may find it disruptive but I found it quite refreshing for a change.As for the talents in the film, Uma Thurman did a great job of playing Dr. Emma Lloyd.  She mentions in the special features that she's never given romantic comedy scripts.  Comedy in general and now with this film, she's given a chance, especially being one of the Executive Producers on the film.  And interesting enough, where she is known for her action-based films such as ""Kill Bill"" and ""The Avengers"", in this film...she actually got hurt (as well as Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and broke her hand.  But despite those injuries, she did a great job and I found her performance to be quite enjoyable but its such a shame that the film didn't get the opportunity for a theatrical release in the US.As for her leading men, Colin Firth is always an actor that is enjoyable to watch onscreen.  Such an amazing talent and deadpan humor, although not a tremendous role in the film, his moments in the film are quite hilarious and entertaining.  Jeffrey Dean Morgan is a surprise.  Many of us have seen him playing the patient on ""Grey's Anatomy"" but ""The Accidental Husband"" is his first major role to play a major character lead along with Uma Thurman and Colin Firth.  But overall, solid performances from both men.Overall, ""The Accidental Husband"" was a good film and does things much differently than other films similar to it.  The inclusion of South Asian cultural themes definitely gives the film a refreshing spin and for the most part, I enjoyed the talent and definitely seeing Uma Thurman take on a romantic comedy which she did very well.

Great performances all around from a very fine cast.  Just one thing had me pulling my hair (again): that scene of the sprinklers in the churchl  I wish I had a dollar for every time I have seen a movie scene where someone sets off a single sprinkler head and ALL the heads open up and drench everyone.  Folks, sprinklers don't work that way, at least not ordinary sprinklers.  Only the sprinkler head that gets the heat opens up; if they all opened most systems would fail due to insufficient water pressure.  Okay, enough Fire Protection 101.  After all it is a comedy and it makes the plot work. So despite that flaw, which has been repeated a hundred times in film, I loved the movie.

Everything in the movie is premeditated, but dressed up to look by happenstance. In the genre' of Romantic Comedies, ""The Accidental Husband,"" asks viewers to suspend all forms of reality. Yes, it's a cute comedy that gives the average Joe hope for landing an up and coming media mogul (Think female Dr. Phil)merely because he's funny and spontaneous. Such antics would suggest women choose mates based on their ability to frolic, not income potential or social contacts.  Imagine Oprah Winfrey leaving a polished business professional for Kat Williams.But the most disappointing part of the movie is that you actually root for the average Joe when he shouldn't win. To this ragard, he's out of his league. When the two found each other, he was living in an apartment located over an Indian restaurant. Characters actually had to walk through the restaurant to get to his apartment. Something has to be said about ambition and self-actualization. It's allright to be a public servant, but to relegate one to obscurity and diminished dreams doesn't bode well with American values. Of course, this isn't stressed in the movie, but one can make a logical deduction.Dr. Emma Lloyd (Uma Thurman) would eventually come to one of two conclusions: 1. Being a mother and the wife of a fireman gives her more joy than the dreams she was originally pursuing or 2. She laments the life she could have had. While, Patrick (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) tries to give her the world as best he could, the burdens of familial responsibilities seem overwhelming and she becomes a shell of her former self.""The Accidental Husband,"" is a nice comedy to watch when you want to decompress with a pleasurable distraction.Edward BrownCore Edge & Charisma Institute",3,"No ""Ugly Truth!""",1262476800,"01 3, 2010",2010,1773,"['Accidental', 'Husband', 'misnomer', 'Everything', 'movie', 'premeditated', 'dressed', 'up', 'look', 'happenstance', 'genre', 'Romantic', 'Comedies', 'Accidental', 'Husband', 'viewers', 'suspend', 'forms', 'reality', 'Yes', 'cute', 'comedy', 'average', 'Joe', 'hope', 'landing', 'up', 'coming', 'media', 'mogul', 'Think', 'female', 'Dr.', 'Phil', 'merely', 'funny', 'spontaneous', 'Such', 'antics', 'would', 'suggest', 'women', 'choose', 'mates', 'based', 'ability', 'frolic', 'not', 'income', 'potential', 'social', 'contacts', 'Imagine', 'Oprah', 'Winfrey', 'leaving', 'polished', 'business', 'professional', 'Kat', 'Williams.But', 'most', 'disappointing', 'part', 'movie', 'actually', 'root', 'average', 'Joe', 'when', 'should', ""n't"", 'win', 'ragard', 'league', 'When', 'two', 'found', 'other', 'was', 'living', 'apartment', 'located', 'Indian', 'restaurant', 'Characters', 'actually', 'had', 'walk', 'restaurant', 'get', 'apartment', 'Something', 'be', 'said', 'ambition', 'self-actualization', 'allright', 'be', 'public', 'servant', 'relegate', 'one', 'obscurity', 'diminished', 'dreams', ""n't"", 'bode', 'well', 'American', 'values', 'course', ""n't"", 'stressed', 'movie', 'one', 'can', 'make', 'logical', 'deduction.Dr', 'Emma', 'Lloyd', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'would', 'eventually', 'come', 'one', 'two', 'conclusions', '1', 'Being', 'mother', 'wife', 'fireman', 'more', 'joy', 'dreams', 'was', 'originally', 'pursuing', '2', 'life', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'Patrick', 'Jeffrey', 'Dean', 'Morgan', 'give', 'world', 'best', 'could', 'burdens', 'familial', 'responsibilities', 'seem', 'overwhelming', 'shell', 'former', 'self', 'Accidental', 'Husband', 'nice', 'comedy', 'watch', 'when', 'want', 'decompress', 'pleasurable', 'distraction.Edward', 'BrownCore', 'Edge', 'Charisma', 'Institute']",N/A

1282015,A1AQBOWEL8TROJ,B002OVED88,Jean-ren Leroux,"[1, 1]","I only write about this film cause it's a good example of how formulas can kill a story. There is nothing true in this film. You take a recipe on how to write a romantic comedy and you follow it blindly and coldly. Without heart and without emotion.  Everything seems rushed. The characters are doing and saying what they are doing and saying because the screenplay (the recipe) says so. The writers have established the scheme of things, how to go from point A to point B and the characters cannot get out of that scheme. They're stuck in the story line which could have easily been written by a novice writer... in his sleep.  Not only is everything predictable (the hero is a firefighter... guess how it's going to end....  With a fire, of course) but it's also boring. The formula is visible a mile away and it makes it impossible to believe any of the characters in their intentions.You can even guess what they were going for with the Indian family living in the same building the hero lives. The idea, far from being of cultural interest, was only to make Uma Thurman's character fall in love with Jeffrey Dean Morgan's character by creating an atmosphere of community where emotions run true, thus establishing a contrast with the cold and more sophisticated environment of Collin Firth's character. Nothing true. Just formula. Why does the Collin Firth's character wait at the last moment, at the altar, to do one of the movie's big moves? Because the script finds it more dramatic, of course.  Why do the two protagonists talk about the hero's last bride... right in front of that last bride's workplace? Because the script finds it more dramatic, of course. You can see her as you speak of her. Why do the two protagonists start an argument in an apartment and continue it on the street as the heroine is running away angry? Because not only have we seen that a zillion time (formula) but also, because the authors thinks it gives the script more rhythm. Everything is done because of the formula. Not because the characters require it.Don't get me wrong, all movies are based on formulas. But the idea is to make those recipes disappear and give the illusion that the characters are the ones driving the story. In such an artificial script, great actors cannot do justice to their role. Thurman, Morgan and Firth have simply wasted their talent on this one by being in an automatic mode. And, personally, I just don't see Jeffrey Dean Morgan as a leading man, here. He would become one in a more recent romantic comedy ""Peace, Love & Misunderstanding"". Here, the magic is not there. A good romantic comedy must come from the heart. There has to be a need to tell that particular story. The plot needs to be fueled by the characters, not the formula.

Jeffrey Dean Morgan plays Patrick, a man who has been dumped by his fiance after being given advice from the Love Doctor. For revenge, he goes after the Doc to teach her a few lessons. He thinks he's teaching her about what it means to screw with someones life, but ultimately he teaches her so much more than that.Jeffrey Dean Morgan is definitely the show stealer here and the heartthrob. He's charming and funny and adorable. He's an ""everyday man"" living with his family in the big city and is a fireman. He's got his buddies and his job and he's very simple. But he's got a big heart and that's very obvious. When the love doctor ""grows on him"" he sets out to make her his. Two people who you would have never thought could find love together do indeed.This film had some flaws and mostly it was under-utilized stardom.

Dr. Emma Lloyd (Uma Thurman, the talented and beautiful star of several excellent and successful films) is a smart and successful talk radio personality, i.e., as smart as a talk radio personality can be, which maybe is what we should be questioning. Emma is engaged to Richard Braxton (Colin Firth, the talented star of several excellent and successful films), a smart and successful businessman. One day, Emma advises a woman to end her (the woman's) relationship with her (the woman's) fianc&eacute;, Patrick Sullivan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan, whose talent is not evident and who hasn't been in a decent film, let alone an excellent and successful one), a New York City firefighter. A native New Yorker myself, I have great respect for New York City's Bravest. Had this character been Jack Morrison (Joaquin Phoenix) or Captain Mike Kennedy (John Travolta) of Ladder 49, I'd have a very different opinion of this film. But Sullivan isn't the kind of person who anyone would consider smart or successful. He wasn't good enough for the unfortunate woman whom Lloyd advised to dump him. How Lloyd could choose to be with him is more than a mystery, it's an affront to the audience and maybe society. This film might have been decent if, after getting to know Sullivan, Lloyd recanted her advice to Sullivan's fianc&eacute; and everyone learned something that helped both couples. But as it is, this is a stinker.",1,"in Hollywood, stupid and poor is better than smart and successful",1361836800,"02 26, 2013",2013,1503,"['one', 'thing', 'root', 'underdog', 'quite', 'thing', 'root', 'stupid', 'poor', 'Dr.', 'Emma', 'Lloyd', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'talented', 'beautiful', 'star', 'several', 'excellent', 'successful', 'films', 'smart', 'successful', 'talk', 'radio', 'personality', 'i.e.', 'as', 'smart', 'talk', 'radio', 'personality', 'can', 'be', 'maybe', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'questioning', 'Emma', 'engaged', 'Richard', 'Braxton', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'talented', 'star', 'several', 'excellent', 'successful', 'films', 'smart', 'successful', 'businessman', 'One', 'day', 'Emma', 'woman', 'end', 'woman', 'relationship', 'woman', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Patrick', 'Sullivan', 'Jeffrey', 'Dean', 'Morgan', 'talent', 'not', 'evident', 'who', ""n't"", 'been', 'decent', 'film', 'let', 'alone', 'excellent', 'successful', 'one', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'firefighter', 'native', 'New', 'Yorker', 'have', 'great', 'respect', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Bravest', 'Had', 'character', 'been', 'Jack', 'Morrison', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Captain', 'Mike', 'Kennedy', 'John', 'Travolta', 'Ladder', '49', ""'d"", 'have', 'very', 'different', 'opinion', 'film', 'Sullivan', ""n't"", 'kind', 'person', 'who', 'anyone', 'would', 'consider', 'smart', 'successful', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'enough', 'unfortunate', 'woman', 'whom', 'Lloyd', 'advised', 'dump', 'How', 'Lloyd', 'could', 'choose', 'be', 'more', 'mystery', 'affront', 'audience', 'maybe', 'society', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'decent', 'getting', 'know', 'Sullivan', 'Lloyd', 'recanted', 'advice', 'Sullivan', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'everyone', 'learned', 'something', 'helped', 'couples', 'stinker']",N/A
