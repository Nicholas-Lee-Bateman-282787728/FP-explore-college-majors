Fans of the series are likely to enjoy the storylines and the dynamics of a terrific cast.At the end of Season Three, the NCIS-LA team was left in a bad place, after botching the exchange of a particularly nasty terrorist.  Special Agent G. Callen (Chris O'Donnell) was in polic custody for murder, mysterious Operations Manager Hettie Lange (Linda Hunt) had been forced into retirement, and the rest of the team was in disgrace.  The clever season opener will reveal how the team survived.A two part episode later in the season offers a peek into the personal life of Sam Hanna (LL Cool J), when an old comrade turns up dead after investigating an alleged Soviet sleeper cell, which just might have smuggled nuclear weapons into the U.S.  An outstanding Christmas episode has the team conducting an investigation on board a Navy ship.  Fans will get to see Hanna and Kensi Blye (Daniela Ruah) in uniform and the rest of the cast at sea, including LAPD detective Marty Deeks (Eric Christian Olsen).  The complicated undercover lives of Callen and Lange will come back to haunt the team more than once in the new season, along with everyone's unfavorite NCIS assistant director Owen Granger (Miguel Ferrar).Marty Deeks and Kensi Blye will continue the delicate (and humorous)dance of their partnership, which keeps threatening to turn into something else.  Computer geek Nell Jones (Renee Smith) will use unique persuasion to get fellow geek Eric Beale (Barrett Foa) to dress as an elf for a Christmas party.  Peter Cambor will return as Dr. Nate Getz for a difficult episode involving the battle death of a Marine.  Callen and Hanna will continue to set a high standard for risk-taking during an operation.
