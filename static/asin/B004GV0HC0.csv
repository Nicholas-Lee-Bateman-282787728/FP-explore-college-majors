1407360,AZAEJB1ECT9HC,B004GV0HC0,Gary P. Cohen,"[0, 0]","When I was a kid, my father used to watch The Virginian.  I could never get into it because, at an hour and a half each episode, I thought it was soooo long.  In the eighties I used to tape The Virginian off of the Western Channel and I found that, if you cut out the commercials, this was a damn good western.  Now with DVDs, you don't even have to worry about cutting the commercials.Anyway, I would recommend this set just based on the episodes I've watched.  But I would recommend the set just for one episode alone ""Showdown.""This episode was written by Gene L. Coon, soon to become one of the producers and writers of Star Trek.  This episode also co-stars a pre-Spock Leonard Nimoy.Just a little bit about the plot.  The Virginian arrives by train in Arizona to buy some cattle.  He is met by the son of the rancher selling the cattle (a young Tom Skeritt)  Before they can get to the saloon, they are rousted by the tough unsmiling Marshal of the town (Michael Ansara)  He rules the town with an iron fist along with his deputy, also his brother, played by Nimoy.  He especially dislikes the rancher and his sons selling the cattle to The Virginian.  As I watched this episode unfold, I thought ""Here we go again,"" another western about a corrupt Marshal ruling his town and terrorizing the decent citizens.  I must have seen this a thousand times before.  I knew it would end with The Virginian shooting it out with the Marshal and his evil brother.  Well without saying too much, before this episode is over it takes a complete 180 degree turn before its fascinating and surprising conclusion.  I grew up watching and loving tv westerns, I still do and I can honestly say that this was one of the best western episodes that I have ever seen.  As stated, I recommend this set based on that episode alone.  Check it out and see for yourself.",5,Worth Getting Especially for One Episode,1373068800,"07 6, 2013",2013,1849,"['When', 'was', 'kid', 'father', 'used', 'watch', 'Virginian', 'could', 'never', 'get', 'hour', 'half', 'episode', 'thought', 'was', 'soooo', 'long', 'eighties', 'used', 'tape', 'Virginian', 'Western', 'Channel', 'found', 'cut', 'out', 'commercials', 'was', 'damn', 'good', 'western', 'Now', 'DVDs', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'worry', 'cutting', 'commercials.Anyway', 'would', 'recommend', 'set', 'just', 'based', 'episodes', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'would', 'recommend', 'set', 'just', 'one', 'episode', 'alone', 'Showdown', 'episode', 'was', 'written', 'Gene', 'L.', 'Coon', 'soon', 'become', 'one', 'producers', 'writers', 'Star', 'Trek', 'episode', 'also', 'pre-Spock', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy.Just', 'little', 'bit', 'plot', 'Virginian', 'arrives', 'train', 'Arizona', 'buy', 'cattle', 'met', 'son', 'rancher', 'selling', 'cattle', 'young', 'Tom', 'Skeritt', 'can', 'get', 'saloon', 'are', 'rousted', 'tough', 'unsmiling', 'Marshal', 'town', 'Michael', 'Ansara', 'rules', 'town', 'iron', 'fist', 'deputy', 'also', 'brother', 'played', 'Nimoy', 'especially', 'rancher', 'sons', 'selling', 'cattle', 'Virginian', 'watched', 'episode', 'unfold', 'thought', 'Here', 'go', 'again', 'western', 'corrupt', 'Marshal', 'ruling', 'town', 'terrorizing', 'decent', 'citizens', 'must', 'have', 'seen', 'thousand', 'times', 'knew', 'would', 'end', 'Virginian', 'shooting', 'out', 'Marshal', 'evil', 'brother', 'Well', 'saying', 'too', 'much', 'episode', 'complete', '180', 'degree', 'turn', 'fascinating', 'surprising', 'conclusion', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'loving', 'tv', 'westerns', 'still', 'do', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'western', 'episodes', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'stated', 'recommend', 'set', 'based', 'episode', 'alone', 'Check', 'out', 'see']",N/A

1407368,ACTMKKP9IA082,B004GV0HC0,paulf,"[12, 12]","Here are capsule impressions of selected programs from season three, which produced a steady stream of fine episodes -- plus a clinker or two.RYKER -- Guest star, Leslie NielsenPistolero weary of living by the gun decides to get on the right side of the law by investigating a murder. Aided by taut script by Frank Fenton, new series regular Clu Gulager belts a home run in his first at bat as Ryker. Nielsen's poker-faced villain offers no hint of his late-career hijinks. Raquel Welch has a bit part as a saloon girl.FELICITY'S SPRING -- Guest stars, Katherine Crawford, Mariette HartleyThe Virginian prepares to marry a beautiful schoolteacher, unaware of a dark secret. Schmaltzy episode is blatantly designed to clog noses on the distaff side of the family audience. Crawford's performance as the angelic Felicity would make Little Eva blush. Drury soldiers ahead gamely but looks uncomfortable, as he ought. Hartley's sister role is thankless.THE BRAZOS KID -- Guest star, Barbara EdenTall tales spun by ambitious newspaperwoman put The Virginian in hot water. Contrived story prone to arbitrary twists turns out better than it should, partly due to smooth presentation, but mostly because the vivacious Eden is such a pleasure to watch. Wild climax, with Gulager riding to the rescue like Paul Revere, is a relic from old melodrama.A FATHER FOR TOBY -- Guest stars, Rory Calhoun, Joanna Moore, Kurt RussellFanciful boy embarrasses Trampas by pretending he is his father, while the secretive actual parent lingers in the shadows. Simple, satisfying episode goes just where the viewer wants. Sturdy veteran star Calhoun effortlessly holds his own with Cobb, Drury and McClure. Bing Russell, Kurt's real-life dad, plays a heavy. Moore was the mother of Tatum O'Neal.ALL NICE AND LEGAL -- Guest star, Anne FrancisThe Virginian gradually warms to an opinionated female attorney. The puckish charm of Francis illuminates episode that takes a practical stance on the feminist issues it raises. Drury appreciated a guest star who was doing a particularly fine job and never failed to do his best to complement it.THE PAYMENT -- Guest star, Lloyd NolanRyker brings his foster father to Medicine Bow after a prison term, hoping he can convince the old crook to reform. Gulager's desperate uphill struggle to keep Nolan out of trouble is backbone of riveting drama. Nolan played many likable rogues in his long career, and always with heart, humor and zest. Bruce Dern was building a lengthy resume of his own out of creepy villain roles such as in this episode.TWO MEN NAMED LAREDO -- Guest star, FabianTrampas befriends a young drifter but discovers him riding away from a murder scene. Psychological drama reminiscent of ""The Three Faces of Eve"" puts the acting talents of pop idol Fabian to a stern test, and he is surprisingly effective.HIDEOUT -- Guest stars, Forrest Tucker, Andrew PrineBetsy is reluctant to expose two fugitives holed up in a remote cabin, but Ryker quickly gets wise. Typically fine episode emphasizes characterizations over action, despite a thrilling horse round-up. Tucker, Prine, Shore and Gulager perform as compatibly as members of a touring theatrical company.SHOWDOWN -- Guest stars, Michael Ansara, Peter WhitneyThe Virginian is forced to decide whether to back a beleaguered lawman he dislikes. The good guys are nasty and the bad guys are friendly in clever episode, written and produced by future ""Star Trek"" writer-producer Gene L. Coon, that gives the standard formula a firm shake. Leonard Nimoy displays some Spock-style inscrutability as one of the dour good guys.WE'VE LOST A TRAIN -- Guest stars, Neville Brand, Peter Brown, William Smith, Phil Carey, Ida Lupino, Rhonda Fleming.While in Texas to bring home a prized bull, Trampas becomes entangled with three rangers assigned to find a missing train. McClure mixes amiably with Brand, Brown and Smith in lively episode that piloted the breezy series ""Laredo."" Lupino is curiously cast as a Mexican matron. The evergreen Fleming has little to do, but does it graciously.",5,Virginian episodes,1329696000,"02 20, 2012",2012,4061,"['Here', 'are', 'capsule', 'impressions', 'selected', 'programs', 'season', 'three', 'produced', 'steady', 'stream', 'fine', 'episodes', 'clinker', 'two.RYKER', 'Guest', 'star', 'Leslie', 'NielsenPistolero', 'weary', 'living', 'gun', 'get', 'right', 'side', 'law', 'investigating', 'murder', 'Aided', 'taut', 'script', 'Frank', 'Fenton', 'new', 'series', 'regular', 'Clu', 'Gulager', 'belts', 'home', 'run', 'first', 'bat', 'Ryker', 'Nielsen', 'poker-faced', 'villain', 'hint', 'late-career', 'hijinks', 'Raquel', 'Welch', 'bit', 'part', 'saloon', 'girl.FELICITY', 'SPRING', 'Guest', 'stars', 'Katherine', 'Crawford', 'Mariette', 'HartleyThe', 'Virginian', 'marry', 'beautiful', 'schoolteacher', 'unaware', 'dark', 'secret', 'Schmaltzy', 'episode', 'blatantly', 'designed', 'clog', 'noses', 'distaff', 'side', 'family', 'audience', 'Crawford', 'performance', 'angelic', 'Felicity', 'would', 'make', 'Little', 'Eva', 'blush', 'Drury', 'soldiers', 'ahead', 'gamely', 'uncomfortable', 'ought', 'Hartley', 'sister', 'role', 'thankless.THE', 'BRAZOS', 'KID', 'Guest', 'star', 'Barbara', 'EdenTall', 'tales', 'spun', 'ambitious', 'newspaperwoman', 'put', 'Virginian', 'hot', 'water', 'Contrived', 'story', 'prone', 'arbitrary', 'twists', 'out', 'better', 'should', 'partly', 'due', 'smooth', 'presentation', 'mostly', 'vivacious', 'Eden', 'such', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'Wild', 'climax', 'Gulager', 'riding', 'rescue', 'Paul', 'Revere', 'relic', 'old', 'melodrama.A', 'FATHER', 'FOR', 'TOBY', 'Guest', 'stars', 'Rory', 'Calhoun', 'Joanna', 'Moore', 'Kurt', 'RussellFanciful', 'boy', 'embarrasses', 'Trampas', 'pretending', 'father', 'secretive', 'actual', 'parent', 'lingers', 'shadows', 'Simple', 'satisfying', 'episode', 'just', 'where', 'viewer', 'Sturdy', 'veteran', 'star', 'Calhoun', 'effortlessly', 'own', 'Cobb', 'Drury', 'McClure', 'Bing', 'Russell', 'Kurt', 'real-life', 'dad', 'heavy', 'Moore', 'was', 'mother', 'Tatum', ""O'Neal.ALL"", 'NICE', 'AND', 'LEGAL', 'Guest', 'star', 'Anne', 'FrancisThe', 'Virginian', 'gradually', 'opinionated', 'female', 'attorney', 'puckish', 'charm', 'Francis', 'episode', 'practical', 'stance', 'feminist', 'issues', 'Drury', 'appreciated', 'guest', 'star', 'who', 'was', 'doing', 'particularly', 'fine', 'job', 'never', 'failed', 'do', 'best', 'complement', 'it.THE', 'PAYMENT', 'Guest', 'star', 'Lloyd', 'NolanRyker', 'foster', 'father', 'Medicine', 'Bow', 'prison', 'term', 'hoping', 'can', 'convince', 'old', 'crook', 'reform', 'Gulager', 'desperate', 'uphill', 'struggle', 'keep', 'Nolan', 'trouble', 'backbone', 'riveting', 'drama', 'Nolan', 'played', 'many', 'likable', 'rogues', 'long', 'career', 'always', 'heart', 'humor', 'zest', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'was', 'building', 'lengthy', 'resume', 'own', 'out', 'creepy', 'villain', 'roles', 'such', 'episode.TWO', 'MEN', 'NAMED', 'LAREDO', 'Guest', 'star', 'FabianTrampas', 'young', 'drifter', 'riding', 'away', 'murder', 'scene', 'Psychological', 'drama', 'reminiscent', 'Three', 'Faces', 'Eve', 'acting', 'talents', 'pop', 'idol', 'Fabian', 'stern', 'test', 'surprisingly', 'effective.HIDEOUT', 'Guest', 'stars', 'Forrest', 'Tucker', 'Andrew', 'PrineBetsy', 'reluctant', 'expose', 'two', 'fugitives', 'holed', 'up', 'remote', 'cabin', 'Ryker', 'quickly', 'wise', 'Typically', 'fine', 'episode', 'characterizations', 'action', 'thrilling', 'horse', 'round-up', 'Tucker', 'Prine', 'Shore', 'Gulager', 'perform', 'as', 'compatibly', 'members', 'touring', 'theatrical', 'company.SHOWDOWN', 'Guest', 'stars', 'Michael', 'Ansara', 'Peter', 'WhitneyThe', 'Virginian', 'forced', 'decide', 'back', 'beleaguered', 'lawman', 'good', 'guys', 'are', 'nasty', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'friendly', 'clever', 'episode', 'written', 'produced', 'future', 'Star', 'Trek', 'writer-producer', 'Gene', 'L.', 'Coon', 'standard', 'formula', 'firm', 'shake', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'Spock-style', 'inscrutability', 'one', 'dour', 'good', 'guys.WE', 'LOST', 'TRAIN', 'Guest', 'stars', 'Neville', 'Brand', 'Peter', 'Brown', 'William', 'Smith', 'Phil', 'Carey', 'Ida', 'Lupino', 'Rhonda', 'Fleming.While', 'Texas', 'bring', 'home', 'prized', 'bull', 'Trampas', 'entangled', 'three', 'rangers', 'assigned', 'find', 'missing', 'train', 'McClure', 'mixes', 'amiably', 'Brand', 'Brown', 'Smith', 'lively', 'episode', 'piloted', 'breezy', 'series', 'Laredo', 'Lupino', 'curiously', 'cast', 'Mexican', 'matron', 'evergreen', 'Fleming', 'little', 'do', 'graciously']",N/A

1407370,A273D8M7DVZ7FL,B004GV0HC0,Renee Fineberg,"[0, 0]","I now own all 9 seasons of THE VIRGINIAN.  I am almost finished with season 4......and have finished season 9, known as THE MEN OF SHILOH.  This review is for all the seasons I have watched...but I am confident what I think holds true for the seasons yet to be watched.  This is one of the finest  series ever produced.....one of the group of westerns that stand out from all those ever produced, including Wagon Train, Gunsmoke, Laramie, Have Gun Will Travel...!  What makes The Virginian one of the best is the writing and the stories.  The stories are the focus of the series...written by some of the best writers.  Once you have the story, you need the characterization to tell it....and the actors to provide it.  That is where The Virginian comes to life.  Every actor or actress who was famous at that time, in television or movies, or theater, appeared in the series.  They were supported by the character actors who were always seen, and often forgotten, but whose faces we saw in so many programs.  Holding everything together was James Drury, who was the thread that bound it all together, in his role as THE VIRGINIAN. He is a terrific actor with a wide range of ability...able to express many emotions quite well.  Highly principled, loyal, and true (as western heroes should be)!  It all began with wonderful actor, Lee J. Cobb as Judge Garth.  Mr Cobb would leave in season 4, and was succeeded by John Dehner, then Charles Bickford, John McIntire, and Stewart Granger.  Other characters would leave and be replaced.  Gary Clarke left, and Clu Culuger came aboard.  Roberta Shore was replaced by another young lady, who was later replaced by someone else.  One almost needed a scorecard to keep track of who came and went.  Doug McClure remained for all 9 seasons, but was missing from many episodes.  No series, however, can last so long unless there is an element of excellence...that special something that makes one come back time and again to watch it.  There is minimal violence necessary to tell the story.  But it is the story....always the story...and the actors who tell it that makes The Virginian work.  Add real cattle and cattle drives, locusts, dust storms, stampedes, and some of the most beautiful scenery to be found....and one has something very special to enjoy.There are stories of success and failure, with a smattering of values and morality thrown in.....there is right and wrong, winners and losers, heroes and villains, love and hate! There is so much, I could not describe it all.  What I can say is that watching The Virginian is time well spent.  James Drury once said in an interview that there were maybe 37 scenarios that were encompassed in every western ever written.  That may be true!  But see what The Virginian does with these 37 scenarios, and never leave disappointed when each one ends.",5,Overall review of THE VIRGINIAN,1384387200,"11 14, 2013",2013,2842,"['now', 'own', '9', 'seasons', 'THE', 'VIRGINIAN', 'am', 'almost', 'finished', 'season', '4', 'have', 'finished', 'season', '9', 'known', 'THE', 'MEN', 'OF', 'SHILOH', 'review', 'seasons', 'have', 'watched', 'am', 'confident', 'what', 'think', 'true', 'seasons', 'yet', 'be', 'watched', 'one', 'finest', 'series', 'ever', 'produced', '..one', 'group', 'westerns', 'stand', 'out', 'ever', 'produced', 'including', 'Wagon', 'Train', 'Gunsmoke', 'Laramie', 'Have', 'Gun', 'Will', 'Travel', 'What', 'Virginian', 'one', 'best', 'writing', 'stories', 'stories', 'are', 'focus', 'series', 'written', 'best', 'writers', 'Once', 'have', 'story', 'need', 'characterization', 'tell', 'actors', 'provide', 'where', 'Virginian', 'life', 'Every', 'actor', 'actress', 'who', 'was', 'famous', 'time', 'television', 'movies', 'theater', 'appeared', 'series', 'were', 'supported', 'character', 'actors', 'who', 'were', 'always', 'seen', 'often', 'forgotten', 'saw', 'so', 'many', 'programs', 'Holding', 'everything', 'together', 'was', 'James', 'Drury', 'who', 'was', 'thread', 'bound', 'together', 'role', 'VIRGINIAN', 'terrific', 'actor', 'wide', 'range', 'ability', 'able', 'express', 'many', 'emotions', 'quite', 'well', 'Highly', 'principled', 'loyal', 'true', 'western', 'heroes', 'should', 'be', 'began', 'wonderful', 'actor', 'Lee', 'J.', 'Cobb', 'Judge', 'Garth', 'Mr', 'Cobb', 'would', 'leave', 'season', '4', 'was', 'succeeded', 'John', 'Dehner', 'then', 'Charles', 'Bickford', 'John', 'McIntire', 'Stewart', 'Granger', 'Other', 'characters', 'would', 'leave', 'be', 'replaced', 'Gary', 'Clarke', 'left', 'Clu', 'Culuger', 'came', 'aboard', 'Roberta', 'Shore', 'was', 'replaced', 'young', 'lady', 'who', 'was', 'later', 'replaced', 'someone', 'else', 'One', 'almost', 'needed', 'scorecard', 'keep', 'track', 'who', 'came', 'went', 'Doug', 'McClure', 'remained', '9', 'seasons', 'was', 'missing', 'many', 'episodes', 'series', 'however', 'can', 'last', 'so', 'long', 'element', 'excellence', 'special', 'something', 'one', 'come', 'back', 'time', 'again', 'watch', 'minimal', 'violence', 'necessary', 'tell', 'story', 'story', 'story', 'actors', 'who', 'tell', 'Virginian', 'work', 'Add', 'real', 'cattle', 'cattle', 'drives', 'locusts', 'dust', 'storms', 'stampedes', 'most', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'be', 'found', '.and', 'one', 'something', 'very', 'special', 'are', 'stories', 'success', 'failure', 'smattering', 'values', 'morality', 'thrown', 'right', 'wrong', 'winners', 'losers', 'heroes', 'villains', 'love', 'hate', 'so', 'much', 'could', 'not', 'describe', 'What', 'can', 'say', 'watching', 'Virginian', 'time', 'well', 'spent', 'James', 'Drury', 'once', 'said', 'interview', 'were', 'maybe', '37', 'scenarios', 'were', 'encompassed', 'western', 'ever', 'written', 'may', 'be', 'true', 'see', 'what', 'Virginian', '37', 'scenarios', 'never', 'leave', 'disappointed', 'when', 'one']",N/A
1407371,A2CX9NZ346HY7T,B004GV0HC0,Richard J. Oravitz,"[13, 14]","One reviewer, Dave, wonders why episodes featured only one of the main stars each week; a Virginian episode with no Trampas, followed next week by a Trampas episode with no Virginian, etc. This was mostly because of mounting costs to produce a weekly 90 minute color tv series that attempted to be as close to a feature film as possible. Stories featuring singular stars were shot at the same time so that a product could be delivered for weekly broadcast in a timely fashion. Somtimes a star would pop in briefly at the beginning or the end of the other star's episode or Judge Garth would be there to tie it all together. Many shows of that time did the same, including NBC's THE NAME OF THE GAME and ABC's COMBAT and MAVERICK. It not only gave the networks a chance to showcase it's stars individually, but more importantly it enabled the studio to shoot two episodes in the same time it would take to do one.As for the series itself, THE VIRGINIAN was always one my favorites. I liked the idea of a 90 minute movie-like format. James Drury was perfect as the title character and my favorite of the show, though I remember the rest of my family preferring the Doug McClure Trampas episodes. The stories and guest stars always made the series "" movie quality "", a fine example of television's Golden Age.Series regular L.Q. Jones does an interview for this set. He was a fixture in Western tv shows and films especially during the 60's and it's always great to hear his comments. I met L.Q. briefly in the early 1970's when he was in Youngstown, Ohio premiering his own produced film THE BROTHERHOOD OF SATAN at the Boardman Plaza theater. He was staying at the Voyager Motor Inn in downtown Youngstown and a friend and myself went over to get an autograph. L.Q. invited us to dinner, during which he explained how Sam Peckinpah shot the Battle of Bloody Porch ending to THE WILD BUNCH. He also talked about Sam's insistence on proper uniforms in MAJOR DUNDEE, Strother Martin, Warren Oates and filming THE BALLAD OF CABLE HOGUE. L.Q. picked up the tab for the meal and I still have my autographed copy of THE WILD BUNCH paperback which he signed for me. A class act if ever there was one, and a special treat to have his interview on this set.",5,VIRGINIAN SEASON 3...continued.,1310774400,"07 16, 2011",2011,2246,"['One', 'reviewer', 'Dave', 'wonders', 'why', 'episodes', 'featured', 'only', 'one', 'main', 'stars', 'week', 'Virginian', 'episode', 'Trampas', 'followed', 'next', 'week', 'Trampas', 'episode', 'Virginian', 'etc', 'was', 'mostly', 'mounting', 'costs', 'produce', 'weekly', '90', 'minute', 'color', 'tv', 'series', 'attempted', 'be', 'as', 'close', 'feature', 'film', 'possible', 'Stories', 'featuring', 'singular', 'stars', 'were', 'shot', 'same', 'time', 'product', 'could', 'be', 'delivered', 'weekly', 'broadcast', 'timely', 'fashion', 'star', 'would', 'pop', 'briefly', 'beginning', 'end', 'other', 'star', 'episode', 'Judge', 'Garth', 'would', 'be', 'there', 'tie', 'together', 'Many', 'shows', 'time', 'did', 'same', 'including', 'NBC', 'THE', 'NAME', 'THE', 'GAME', 'ABC', 'COMBAT', 'MAVERICK', 'not', 'only', 'gave', 'networks', 'chance', 'showcase', 'stars', 'individually', 'more', 'importantly', 'enabled', 'studio', 'shoot', 'two', 'episodes', 'same', 'time', 'would', 'take', 'do', 'one.As', 'series', 'VIRGINIAN', 'was', 'always', 'one', 'favorites', 'liked', 'idea', '90', 'minute', 'movie-like', 'format', 'James', 'Drury', 'was', 'perfect', 'title', 'character', 'favorite', 'show', 'remember', 'rest', 'family', 'preferring', 'Doug', 'McClure', 'Trampas', 'stories', 'guest', 'stars', 'always', 'made', 'series', 'movie', 'quality', 'fine', 'example', 'television', 'Golden', 'Age.Series', 'regular', 'L.Q', 'Jones', 'interview', 'set', 'was', 'fixture', 'Western', 'tv', 'shows', 'films', 'especially', '60', 'always', 'great', 'hear', 'comments', 'met', 'L.Q', 'briefly', 'early', '1970', 'when', 'was', 'Youngstown', 'Ohio', 'premiering', 'own', 'produced', 'film', 'THE', 'BROTHERHOOD', 'OF', 'SATAN', 'Boardman', 'Plaza', 'theater', 'was', 'staying', 'Voyager', 'Motor', 'Inn', 'downtown', 'Youngstown', 'friend', 'went', 'get', 'autograph', 'L.Q', 'invited', 'dinner', 'explained', 'how', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'shot', 'Battle', 'Bloody', 'Porch', 'ending', 'THE', 'WILD', 'BUNCH', 'also', 'talked', 'Sam', 'insistence', 'proper', 'uniforms', 'MAJOR', 'DUNDEE', 'Strother', 'Martin', 'Warren', 'Oates', 'filming', 'THE', 'BALLAD', 'OF', 'CABLE', 'HOGUE', 'L.Q', 'picked', 'up', 'tab', 'meal', 'still', 'have', 'autographed', 'copy', 'THE', 'WILD', 'BUNCH', 'paperback', 'signed', 'A', 'class', 'act', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'special', 'treat', 'have', 'interview', 'set']",N/A

Got to admit I miss Gary Clarke as (Steve Hill). Randy Boone as a new regular is quick witted and the music in the show is great. Randy Boone and Roberta Shore actually produced an LP together back in the 60's. James Drury and Doug McClure along with Lee J. Cobb are the glue in The Virginian.  I know Roberta Shore eventually leaves the series and that will be interesting how it is handled. Don't want go give it away as some of you haven't ever seen The Virginian. To conclude, if you want to see a very family friendly series based on the old west this series is a true delight.
