He created the part for other's to build on, and build on Danny Glover did when he grabbed that hat and dropped to his knees. His sister (I don't have her name)was the perfect opposite to him especially when she called him a rat (lol). Glover is remarkable understated, and are all the players and the movie itself.",5,Bravo!!!!,1240704000,"04 26, 2009",2009,386,"['will', 'tell', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'performance', 'own', 'created', 'part', 'other', 'build', 'build', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'did', 'when', 'grabbed', 'hat', 'dropped', 'knees', 'sister', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'name', 'was', 'perfect', 'opposite', 'especially', 'when', 'called', 'rat', 'lol', 'Glover', 'remarkable', 'understated', 'are', 'players', 'movie']",N/A

It's basically a long, drawn out story about the life of a black family in the mid century. Save time and money, pass over this lemon.

Ester Rolle as Lena Younger doesn't have quite the command and authority of Claudia McNeil, but her performance is solid and convincing. Danny Glover's Walter is serviceable, but trying to match the electricity of Sidney Poiter's interpretation is an uphill battle.  Starletta DuPois' portrayal of Ruth fails to convey the physical and emotional fatigue that Ruby Dee exuded with seeming effortlessness.  Kim Yancey's performance as Beneatha is solid, but seems to borrow too liberally from Diana Sands' work in the earlier film.  A nice treat is John Fiedler, reprising his role from the earlier film.
