I honeslty can't remember if it had any swearing in it (I guess it must not have been too much, or any at all, if I recall it).  The only sex is several people kissing and it is implied that one couple slept together, and the daughter and her boyfriend sleep together since they are staying together at a house for Christmas.  I enjoyed the movie and will watch it again. Most people would skip it because they think it is too predictable or &#34;lame&#34;, but I like movies like that because I know I will be watching something that won't make me feel like I have just been &#34;slimed&#34;.Emily, a widow, is disappointed when her daughter Heather won't come home to Oregon for Christmas (Emily actually makes her daughter feel really guilty for it).  So Emily decides to surprise Heather and trades houses with Charles, a college professor who lives in Boston and who is desperate to break his writer's block on his latest overdue novel and to escape Christmas. Emily is the one who is surprised when she finds out her daughter left for Florida with her boyfriend and has only Charles' brother, Ray, for company.  Ray kindly offers to show Emily around Boston (feeling guilty that he almost got her arrested) and they start falling for each other.  However, Emily has to try to let go of the guilt she feels from the memory of her husband, and Ray also has to learn to let love in, because has never really had a meaningful relationship because he always traveled for his job, and both he and his brother have never really known what love and family is.  Emily's friend, Faith, feeling sorry that Emily will be alone for Christmas, flies to Oregon to spend the holidays' with her, only to find Charles staying at the house.  Faith is forced to stay in the house with Charles since there is no way for her to get back home, and also runs interference between Charles and the very friendly neighbors and their children.  Seeing Charles' manuscript lying around, she reads it and then offers suggestions to fix it (much to his horror - the female character in is book is based on an old girlfriend that he hates); however, as he starts to come around to realizing that Faith's ideas are justified and will make the book better, he is flowing with ideas and excitedly changes his whole book.  So, as she comes to find out why he hates Christmas and as he comes to find out why she hates men (both because of past relationships) they start to let go of their past and wonder if they each could be the others future. Also, to throw one last thing into the mix, Heather, feeling guilty, thinking that her mother is alone in Boston, flies home to be with her, only to find that she's not alone, but is finally moving on with her life.Overall, I liked the movie and will watch it again.",4,Trading Christmas - would watch again,1379548800,"09 19, 2013",2013,2887,"['like', 'good', 'clean', 'movies', 'as', 'clean', 'can', 'get', 'nowadays', 'Trading', 'Christmas', 'was', 'really', 'quite', 'clean', 'honeslty', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'had', 'swearing', 'guess', 'must', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'much', 'recall', 'only', 'sex', 'several', 'people', 'kissing', 'implied', 'one', 'couple', 'slept', 'together', 'daughter', 'boyfriend', 'sleep', 'together', 'are', 'staying', 'together', 'house', 'Christmas', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'will', 'watch', 'again', 'Most', 'people', 'would', 'skip', 'think', 'too', 'predictable', '34', 'lame', '34', 'like', 'movies', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'watching', 'something', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'feel', 'have', 'just', 'been', '34', 'slimed', '34', '.Emily', 'widow', 'disappointed', 'when', 'daughter', 'Heather', 'wo', ""n't"", 'come', 'home', 'Oregon', 'Christmas', 'Emily', 'actually', 'daughter', 'feel', 'really', 'guilty', 'Emily', 'surprise', 'Heather', 'trades', 'houses', 'Charles', 'college', 'professor', 'who', 'Boston', 'who', 'desperate', 'break', 'writer', 'block', 'latest', 'overdue', 'novel', 'escape', 'Christmas', 'Emily', 'one', 'who', 'surprised', 'when', 'out', 'daughter', 'left', 'Florida', 'boyfriend', 'only', 'Charles', 'brother', 'Ray', 'company', 'Ray', 'kindly', 'show', 'Emily', 'Boston', 'feeling', 'guilty', 'almost', 'got', 'arrested', 'start', 'falling', 'other', 'However', 'Emily', 'try', 'let', 'go', 'guilt', 'memory', 'husband', 'Ray', 'also', 'learn', 'let', 'love', 'never', 'really', 'had', 'meaningful', 'relationship', 'always', 'traveled', 'job', 'brother', 'have', 'never', 'really', 'known', 'what', 'love', 'family', 'Emily', 'friend', 'Faith', 'feeling', 'sorry', 'Emily', 'will', 'be', 'alone', 'Christmas', 'Oregon', 'spend', 'holidays', 'only', 'find', 'Charles', 'staying', 'house', 'Faith', 'forced', 'stay', 'house', 'Charles', 'way', 'get', 'back', 'home', 'also', 'interference', 'Charles', 'very', 'friendly', 'neighbors', 'children', 'Seeing', 'Charles', 'manuscript', 'lying', 'around', 'then', 'suggestions', 'fix', 'much', 'horror', 'female', 'character', 'book', 'based', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'however', 'come', 'realizing', 'Faith', 'ideas', 'are', 'justified', 'will', 'make', 'book', 'better', 'flowing', 'ideas', 'excitedly', 'changes', 'whole', 'book', 'So', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'Christmas', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'men', 'past', 'relationships', 'start', 'let', 'go', 'past', 'wonder', 'could', 'be', 'others', 'future', 'Also', 'throw', 'one', 'last', 'thing', 'mix', 'Heather', 'feeling', 'guilty', 'thinking', 'mother', 'alone', 'Boston', 'home', 'be', 'only', 'find', 'not', 'alone', 'finally', 'moving', 'life.Overall', 'liked', 'movie', 'will', 'watch', 'again']",N/A

1554059,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B008IG0DU0,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 2]","Who is Debbie Macomber? Well, this film, TRADING CHRISTMAS, is based on her book WHEN CHRISTMAS COMES. I'm neither familiar with Debbie Macomber nor have read her books. The draw for me was Tom Cavanagh (so awesome in ED). I'd pretty much watch anything that dude is in. And since this is Christmastime, double bonus!TRADING CHRISTMAS, first aired in 2011 on the Hallmark Channel, tracks three storylines. Almost three years since her husband passed away, 2nd grade educator Emily Springer (Faith Ford) still can't let go, still clings too fiercely to memories of him. Traditions are very important to Emily, so imagine her chagrin when her 21-year-old daughter Heather tells her that this year she can't spend Christmas with her. Heather instead plans to be with her boyfriend at his grandparents' place in Phoenix, Arizona. Left to fend for herself, Emily decides to get out of town, try something new. She swaps homes for the holidays.Charles Johnson (Cavanagh) is a Boston college professor struggling with his latest book. He requires privacy. He loathes Christmas. He and Emily are soon corresponding by email. He swaps homes for the holidays, leaving his swank but austere condo for Emily's Victorian house in South Woodbourne, Washington. Loathing Christmas as he does, he's in for a nasty surprise because Emily happens to be a bigtime Christmas decorator and his temporary digs is all garlanded and festively lighted and bedecked-the-halls. For Charles and for Emily, unexpected romance lurks in strange surroundings. Emily strikes up a friendship with Charles' brother (Gil Bellows), never mind that when they first saw each other, he thought she broke into his brother's condo. I guess this qualifies as a cute meet.In South Woodbourne (or as Charles calls it: ""Whoville""), Charles is promptly inconvenienced by an unexpected house guest in the shape of Emily's bustling best friend Faith (Gabrielle Miller). Faith has come to visit Emily but then ends up getting stranded in town. She and Charles are soon bickering. Except that Charles didn't factor on Emily's neighborhood as being one of those in which everyone checks in on everyone. Faith proves to be a helpful mediator, dealing with the constant knocks on the door, allowing Charles to get back to work on his novel. He (very reluctantly) allows her to stay. Sometimes, a love story begins with a different kind of fireworks.Who is Debbie Macomber? Well, if this movie is any indication and if it's stayed faithful to her novel, then she's an author who doesn't rely too much on saccharine moves. I was struck with how the events in the two primary plotlines play out naturally. There don't seem to be too many forced scenes. The romance between Emily and Charles' brother unfolds in low key fashion and seems the more realistic for it. Charles and Faith's more vibrant, more contentious interactions drew me in and made me smile (Faith is one of those folks who could exhaust you but also pull you in with her activity and sheer enthusiasm; faced with that, even Cavanagh's prickly character could stay prickly for only so long).

Her daughter, Heather, is in Boston going to college and is asserting her independence, insisting that just this once she not come home for Christmas. She tells her Mom she is going to stay put for the holiday, when actually she is going to Arizona with her boyfriend. Emily gets the bright idea to take Christmas to Heather. She goes online and arranges a house swap with a Scrooge-ish college professor in Boston who is also a writer of novels. He happens to be under pressure of a deadline and needs somewhere quiet to get away and write. She ends up in his stark city apartment, with no daughter in town, and he gets her heavily holiday decorated Victorian style home in a friendly little town that won't leave him alone. If that isn't enough, throw in lots of Christmas cookies, a tripped security alarm, a man who is afraid of being sued for almost having Emily arrested, a friend who decides to drop in unannounced to surprise Emily, an expired driver's license,  a bus that only leaves town once a week, a daughter who doesn't know what she wants, a few snowballs, and neighbor kids on sleds. The story is fun and interesting with a diversity of characters.As for family friendliness, there were just a few moments here and there where I wasn't sure where they were going to take things--the daughter and her boyfriend spending the holiday alone in Arizona at his grandparents' vacant home, Emily lying in a passionate embrace on the sofa with a man she just met a couple of days before, Emily's friend asking her if she ""got lucky"", lots of kissing, and a couple of double entendre jokes that might go over some heads.

The same director of Mrs. Miracle Michael M. Scott(also did ""The Most Wonderful Time of the Year"") does a fine time tying together all the personalities that intertwine during ""the holidays"".Oregon Widow goes to Boston to surprise daughter who goes to Phoenix to be with boyfriend; meanwhile, Bostonian brother#1, an uptight author, housetrades with widow and is surprised by widow's best friend who came to surprise Oregon widow at her home.  Bostonian brother #1 is at complete odds with visiting widow's friend who has no where to go. Bostonian brother #2, still in Boston, takes an interest in lonely widow staying at his brother's house.  Whew!It's much easier to watch, and a lot of fun.  Kids will be bored to death with all the battle of the sexes and kissing and romance and all that predictable, happy ending stuff that it delivers.Well acted(many from Canada): Gil Bellows, an accomplished thesbian, way back when he was in Ally Mcbeal; Tom Cavanagh is hilarious as the put upon, uptight author.  I remember him recently from Yogi Bear as Ranger Smith.  Yes, we have kids, and they walked out of this movie.

After the credits rolled through, all I could do was sit there and say ""wow"" and rushed over to write this review.  Let me tell you, this would be the fourth Christmas movie I watched thus far this holiday season.  After so many disappointing movies, I am so glad I picked this up at the Hallmark store.  I finally found a winner.Based on Debbie Macomber's book, ""When Christmas Comes -Trading Christmas: Trading Christmas\The Forgetful Bride"" the movie revolved around three couples and how one Christmas house swap changed their lives for the better.  Widower Emily's daughter, Heather, wanted something different for Christmas this year and told her mother that she wasn't going to go home.  Emily decided to surprise Heather by bringing Christmas to her in Boston.  Placing her home in a house swap, she exchanged her home with professor/writer, Charles Brewster, who needed a change of scenery for his writer's block.  But when Emily found that her daughter had flown the coop, Charles' brother, Ray, helped fill the void.  Maybe Christmas can be saved after all.What really blew me was the amazing choices in casting.  The acting was natural and you couldn't deny the subtle chemistry between everyone.  The movie handled the three story lines by ping-ponging back and forth between the three couples as their lives were intertwined.  Even though they technically were not the main characters, my favorite couple had to be Charles and Faith.  They were absolutely hilarious.  From the first moment they met, they had such an explosion of chemistry that kept you jumping and laughing.  I looked forward to all their scenes.  They gave the atmosphere a more lighthearted air.  While on the other hand, Emily and Ray had a more mature build-up to their relationship.  Their romance was sweet and had a thoughtfulness that send a pang to one's own heart.  Great plot lines that were nicely balanced and brilliantly scripted.  The movie had humor, light drama and lovable characters.  No one overshadowed the other and each romance was slightly different.  I have not read the original novel so I cannot tell you how accurate it is.  However, accurate or not, this movie can hold its own without any doubt.  And the ending was perfectly wrapped up in a sweet bow.  Sigh~  This is a clean movie.  The most you will see is kissing.If you love Debbie Macomber and are a fan of her books, then this is the movie to see and keep.  You will not be disappointed.  If you generally love sweet, romantic movies, then pick this up.  Christmas fan?  This movie did a great job of incorporating the theme.  If you are looking with a heavy, deep plot lines, skip this.  All in all, this movie is a keeper for me.Side note:  There is a movie that followed the same plot line -The Holiday.  If you like 'Trading Christmas', give this a shot as well.",5,"The Movie Will Leave You Smiling and Saying ""Wow""",1352505600,"11 10, 2012",2012,2862,"['Wow', 'What', 'great', 'movie', 'credits', 'rolled', 'could', 'do', 'was', 'sit', 'say', 'wow', 'rushed', 'write', 'review', 'Let', 'tell', 'would', 'be', 'fourth', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'watched', 'thus', 'far', 'holiday', 'season', 'so', 'many', 'disappointing', 'movies', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'picked', 'up', 'Hallmark', 'store', 'finally', 'found', 'winner.Based', 'Debbie', 'Macomber', 'book', 'When', 'Christmas', 'Comes', '-Trading', 'Christmas', 'Trading', 'Christmas\\The', 'Forgetful', 'Bride', 'movie', 'revolved', 'three', 'couples', 'how', 'one', 'Christmas', 'house', 'swap', 'changed', 'lives', 'better', 'Widower', 'Emily', 'daughter', 'Heather', 'wanted', 'something', 'different', 'Christmas', 'year', 'told', 'mother', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'go', 'home', 'Emily', 'decided', 'surprise', 'Heather', 'bringing', 'Christmas', 'Boston', 'Placing', 'home', 'house', 'swap', 'exchanged', 'home', 'professor/writer', 'Charles', 'Brewster', 'who', 'needed', 'change', 'scenery', 'writer', 'block', 'when', 'Emily', 'found', 'daughter', 'had', 'flown', 'coop', 'Charles', 'brother', 'Ray', 'helped', 'fill', 'void', 'Maybe', 'Christmas', 'can', 'be', 'saved', 'really', 'blew', 'was', 'amazing', 'choices', 'casting', 'acting', 'was', 'natural', 'could', ""n't"", 'deny', 'subtle', 'chemistry', 'everyone', 'movie', 'handled', 'three', 'story', 'lines', 'ping-ponging', 'back', 'forth', 'three', 'couples', 'lives', 'were', 'intertwined', 'Even', 'technically', 'were', 'not', 'main', 'characters', 'favorite', 'couple', 'had', 'be', 'Charles', 'Faith', 'were', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'first', 'moment', 'met', 'had', 'explosion', 'chemistry', 'kept', 'jumping', 'laughing', 'looked', 'forward', 'scenes', 'gave', 'atmosphere', 'more', 'lighthearted', 'air', 'other', 'hand', 'Emily', 'Ray', 'had', 'more', 'mature', 'build-up', 'relationship', 'romance', 'was', 'sweet', 'had', 'thoughtfulness', 'send', 'pang', 'one', 'own', 'heart', 'Great', 'plot', 'lines', 'were', 'nicely', 'balanced', 'brilliantly', 'scripted', 'movie', 'had', 'humor', 'light', 'drama', 'lovable', 'characters', 'one', 'overshadowed', 'other', 'romance', 'was', 'slightly', 'different', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'original', 'novel', 'can', 'not', 'tell', 'how', 'accurate', 'However', 'accurate', 'not', 'movie', 'can', 'hold', 'own', 'doubt', 'ending', 'was', 'perfectly', 'wrapped', 'up', 'sweet', 'bow', 'Sigh~', 'clean', 'movie', 'most', 'will', 'see', 'kissing.If', 'love', 'Debbie', 'Macomber', 'are', 'fan', 'books', 'then', 'movie', 'see', 'keep', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'generally', 'love', 'sweet', 'romantic', 'movies', 'then', 'pick', 'up', 'Christmas', 'fan', 'movie', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'incorporating', 'theme', 'are', 'looking', 'heavy', 'deep', 'plot', 'lines', 'skip', 'movie', 'keeper', 'me.Side', 'note', 'movie', 'followed', 'same', 'plot', 'line', '-The', 'Holiday', 'like', ""'Trading"", 'Christmas', 'give', 'shot', 'as', 'well']",N/A

A pair of movies, already a success and to their credit based on Debbie Macomber's novels have already been made prompting Hallmark to again bring another of her novels to their holiday line-up.Christmas re-opens many happy and not-so-happy memories for Emily (Faith Ford). A widow with a college age daughter, both she and Heather still enjoy every special holiday tradition three years later. Or that is what Emily thought. Emily's spirits are high with the impending arrival of her daughter as she decorates the house and purchases the supplies they'll need for holiday baking but instead of welcoming Heather home, the girl confesses that she would rather make her own plans... just this once. Impulsively she agrees to a house swap to be with her daughter, travelling to Boston to swap homes with a college professor, Charles (Tom Cavanaugh) who is in desperate need of peace and quiet to finish his current novel. To further complicate matters, Emily's friend Faith (Gabrielle Miller) decides to pay her a surprise visit only to be surprised to find a stranger - Charles, in her best friend's house!Despite my hysterical giggles and admittance that Christmas movies seem no better than recycled plots and sub-par acting, each year, I eagerly type titles into the Amazon search bar hoping that there will be a slew of them on DVD. Usually each year, I am rewarded. No shortage on Christmas cheer is skimped on in this sweet, heartwarming tale. From Emily's over-decked-out house (talk about overkill!) to the city streets, everything sparkles with hometown memories and the shininess of new holiday traditions. It promotes family but also explores the idea that there is a time for change and even when it hurts, there is healing in it.Borrowing a page (or maybe, an entire playbook?) from the charming Nancy Meyers film, The Holiday, this script is not nearly as witty but it also is one of the better ones for television. The characters are fun-loving, most especially Faith whose a wonderful source of comedy as she refuses to take ""no"" for an answer and her determination to make the best out of an... awkward situation is endearing. There's sweetness to the story that is MIA in too many films, one that almost makes one think back to the age of film that didn't have high-tech gadgets or cool effects. Everyone learns what they need to and some of the protagonists even realize that letting go of one's past can sometimes be a painful but rewarding experience.
