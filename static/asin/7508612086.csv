It also has a place in my heart because my great great grandparents on my moms mother's side were from England & Wales. My great great grandfather was a Englishman from Liverpool and my great great grandmother was a welsh woman. They had my great grandmother in America but my great grandmother married my great grandfather and he was mostly welsh american. Then my grandfather on my mothers side had a grandfather on his mothers side that came from Wales. So u see im both of English and Welsh ancestry and can relate to the difference of the 2. This show is a must have for British comedy fans. Its funny and full of heart.

486877,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,7508612086,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 2]","Note: This collection features all 19 episodes of the 3 seasons of Gavin and Stacey plus the 2008 Christmas Special.What began as a charming romance morphed into one of the sturdiest ensemble comedies that you're likely to encounter. It is hard not to be caught up in the sweetness and hilarity that defines the world of ""Gavin & Stacey."" In just three short seasons (only 19 episodes), the show was able to carve out an intricate portrait of family and friendship with universal appeal. Ostensibly, the show began as a vehicle to establish the long distance romance between the titular leads Gavin (the effective Matthew Horne) and Stacey (the effervescent Joanna Page). Gavin lives with his parents in Essex while Stacey and her clan are Welsh. Although not a huge geographical distance, much of the comedy derives from a culture clash of sorts. Gavin, still in a protracted adolescence, pals around with his boyhood friends while Stacey is still very much tied to her family. But after they meet cute, there is no going back for the love struck couple!The first season deals extensively with the logistics of the long distance courtship. To commit to one another, the couple's relationship has a resoundingly huge affect on everyone else in their lives. The course of true love never runs entirely smooth, however, but a duo this endearing deserves a bit of happiness. Season Two has taken the relationship to the next level and the pair must now contend with choosing just one place to live. The resultant strain, once again, has long range repercussions for the extended families. And Season Three progresses the couple even further with another move and a life changing announcement. I've been purposefully vague to avoid major plot spoilers, but rest assured--""Gavin & Stacey"" isn't about what happens as much as it's about the journey.Through the episodes, this comedy is both riotously funny and genuinely touching when appropriate. The cast of supporting characters is huge--but everyone is surprisingly well developed and has more than their share of moments to shine. I could single almost anyone out of the deft and talented cast (loved all the parents), but I will limit my comments to three individuals (for the sake of brevity--this is a review, not an essay). Creators Ruth Jones and James Corden cast themselves (brilliantly, I might add) as Stacey's and Gavin's best friends respectively. Jones is a revelation as the tough talking Nessa, whose brutish exterior hides genuine depth and Corden is an irrepressible man/child (Smithy) whose enthusiasm is as infectious as it is ridiculous. Nessa and Smithy both feel left out in the cold with their friends' new relationship and their antagonism toward one another is hilarious. Their on again/off again shenanigans become a true series highlight.Lastly, there is Stacey's Uncle Bryn (Rob Brydon)--a truly unique character. Brydon plays Bryn as larger than life--so sweet, so big hearted, and so strangely unnerving. His good intentions frequently cross the line into cringe worthy uncomfortableness. He has immensely quotable lines and is expertly funny in every situation. He did pick up a BAFTA award nomination for this performance (and Corden won one), while Corden and Jones both won British Comedy Awards. This is an incredibly witty piece and laugh out loud funny. It explores various stages of couplehood, and speaks directly to family and friends helping to define who we are. Like I said, this is a tremendous ensemble that handles the humor deftly--but the show allows great character growth and depth as well. I love this show--both warm and wacky, it is a great addition to the modern British sitcoms!

486879,A3R8PXSFGY9MC2,7508612086,Spider Monkey,"[1, 1]","To be honest I've been a little late coming to `Gavin and Stacey', but a friend lent me this boxset and after watching one or two episodes I was completely captivated. This follows Gavin, who is from Essex and Stacey, who is from Wales and their friends and family as they start a new relationship and cope with travelling back and forth between the countries and the normal early relationship teething problems. The cast is simply superb and from the bro-mance between Gavin and his best mate Smithy to the hard bitten Nessa this will have you laughing out loud at too many times to count. My favourite has to be Gavin's mum, Pamela, who is slightly dippy, but cares deeply about her son and husband and comes out with some cracking lines. There are so many catchphrases in the series' that you will be repeating them to each other in short time and reliving the joy of the series long after you have finished watching them. The extras are pretty great, with hilarious outtakes, and featurettes about the making of the series and favourite moments etc. This is a genuinely funny series and manages to be sensitive and endearing at the same time. If you haven't seen it yet then snap this up and enjoy everything it has to offer and if you have already seen this on TV then this is an excellent package that includes the Xmas special, some extras and the complete three series' to relive again and again.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.",5,Gavin and Stacey,1294790400,"01 12, 2011",2011,1473,"['be', 'honest', ""'ve"", 'been', 'little', 'late', 'coming', 'Gavin', 'Stacey', 'friend', 'lent', 'boxset', 'watching', 'one', 'two', 'episodes', 'was', 'completely', 'captivated', 'Gavin', 'who', 'Essex', 'Stacey', 'who', 'Wales', 'friends', 'family', 'start', 'new', 'relationship', 'cope', 'travelling', 'back', 'forth', 'countries', 'normal', 'early', 'relationship', 'teething', 'problems', 'cast', 'simply', 'superb', 'bro-mance', 'Gavin', 'best', 'mate', 'Smithy', 'hard', 'bitten', 'Nessa', 'will', 'have', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'count', 'favourite', 'be', 'Gavin', 'mum', 'Pamela', 'who', 'slightly', 'dippy', 'deeply', 'son', 'husband', 'out', 'cracking', 'lines', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'catchphrases', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'repeating', 'other', 'short', 'time', 'reliving', 'joy', 'series', 'long', 'have', 'finished', 'watching', 'extras', 'are', 'pretty', 'great', 'hilarious', 'outtakes', 'making', 'series', 'favourite', 'moments', 'etc', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'series', 'manages', 'be', 'sensitive', 'endearing', 'same', 'time', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'then', 'snap', 'up', 'enjoy', 'everything', 'offer', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'TV', 'then', 'excellent', 'package', 'Xmas', 'special', 'extras', 'complete', 'three', 'series', 'relive', 'again', 'again.Feel', 'free', 'check', 'out', 'blog', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'profile', 'page']",Gavin And Stacey - Series 1-3 And 2008 Christmas Special [NON-U.S.A.
