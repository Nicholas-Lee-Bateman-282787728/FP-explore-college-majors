186947,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,157252281X,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[10, 12]","Love, in Different for Girls, broke all boundaries. It went past the idea of straight or gay and went directly into the idea that two people can fall in love no matter what consequences or hurdles life may have awaiting for them. It went beyond the sexual parameters set forth in most films and instead lied them out on the table for the world to see. The was a very real love story. In fact, I would say it was one of the more true stories that I have seen on the screen for a very long time. You could see the chemistry, you could see the insecurity, you could see the beginnings of a beautiful relationship and it was perfect. You know the unsure feelings that you have when you first begin a relationship, the hesitancy, the butterflies, the stepping stones . well, they were all demonstrated in this film. I cannot speak enough of how real and true this film was. It confirmed my belief that you do not need to have the clich&eacute;d, pronounced roles of male and female to have a beautiful love story, all you need are two people and a heart that needs to be found.The acting was decent. There could have been a bit more passion between the two, but I am not complaining. I completely understood what they wanted, where they wanted to go, and what they needed to do to achieve it. One of the most powerful scenes of this film was when Kim undresses and they make love. For the first time in cinema history, it was love and not sex. They did it to better their relationship, to say to each other that they were comfortable with their decisions. They wanted to say ""I love you"" in the best way possible. While no words were spoken, you were able to glance into their minds and hearts, and it takes very good acting to allow this to happen. They even demonstrate this even further when Prentice lays for a while after talking about what just happened and he ponders over what to do now he had no job or money and nowhere to live. Together they work on a solution. There is no ""me"" in this relationship. This is when Prentice decides to finally make his true feelings known in a very bold, yet beautiful fashion. You will have to see the film to experience the true emotion.Overall, I was very impressed with this film. I loved the boundaries that it broke, again .. the truth that it spoke, and the realistic story that it presented. For those that will look at this review and get quinsy in their stomachs, I ask you think . what is so different between this story and most of the recycled Hollywood garbage that we watch on a weekly basis? My answer is nothing. If I have to watch a man and a woman kiss for twenty minutes on screen, I sure as anything want to see other parts of our culture as well. This was a beautiful film that will be used as a stepping stone for other films of this nature. While I cannot say that it was perfect, it was a start. I cannot wait to see where this film will take us in the future. I suggest this film to anyone that is looking to see a fresh story on a very old tale.

It is about Kim, a post operative trans-sexual and Paul, his/her mate from school.  Karl/Kim was bullied at school for being gay, in reality he was a she in a male body.  Paul protected him.  We see that in flashback.  Then Paul sees Kim/Karl and the penny drops for Paul...they know each other, but obviously something is different.  Paul liked Karl at school, 'liked' him although didn't act on it I think.  Now there is the social taboo of sex change rather than same sex attraction...but Paul is curious and persues a relationship with Kim...not sexual, just a relationship.  Then he questions further but becomes aroused by what he hears and leaves.  Things become sinister when they are arrested for their behaviour because of the ensuing argument.  The Policeman gropes Kim and once again Paul protects Kim/Karl.  This time it goes to court...not good.  Kim needs to be a witness for Paul in court but her life has been spent trying to blend in, not stand out...this is a trial for her in more ways than one.  She does the right thing and becomes the protector but the Press get hold of the story and Paul seemingly turns on Kim and sells the story.  However, all is not what it seems.  Kim encouraged him to sell the story of their schoolboy situation and following relationship, but the accompanying picture is that of the school bully who targetted Karl/Kim.  They end up...do you want to know?  Not going to say except...sigh.  Cute, cute, cute.  There is a shocking scene when Paul asks Kim to 'show him' what was done...shocking in that what you see and what you know about the actor playing Kim don't come together.  You see woman but know she IS a man...very well done.  Steven Mackintosh plays a great girl.  Rupert Graves plays an endearing besotted suitor...worth a look, it will be a double take at 'that' scene.

186953,A25JCW6ZCYBZU5,157252281X,D. Lipsitz,"[4, 6]","This is a very well made and tasteful love story, based in England.The story line opens up with Kim Foyle, a transsexual woman, riding in a cab to work when she literally runs into Paul Prentice, her best friend when she was Karl.  Of course, she is recognized, and eventually sees Paul again.The usual questions and confusion come up, particularly when Paul finds himself falling for Kim.  Paul of course is heterosexual, and in a relationship with a woman that is early on recognized as going nowhere.  Paul's curiosity extends to personal textbook research on gender and sexuality, in an attempt to understand not just his best friend, but himself.Eventually, a confrontation blows up when Paul finds himself sexually arroused by Kim's description of how the hormonal treatments changed her appearance.  He is eventually arrested for indecent exposure, and Kim is also arrested when she protests on Paul's behalf.  Inside the police vehicle, Kim is molested by one of the officers, and Paul comes to her defense.  Paul is then beaten until the other officer stops the assault.Kim is threatened with prison time in a men's prison if she testifies to the abuse by the police officer, but if she fails to testify Paul will unjustly go to prison instead.  British law determines which prison you go to based upon your birth sex, and Kim knows she will be raped and killed if sent to prison.  And yet, she is also falling for her best friend.  She must also deal with the effect the whole story is having on her job and her family.While the story is very well done and hits a bit close to home for me (confusing relationships generally do), the use of a non-transsexual man in the role of Kim was somewhat distasteful.  There are hundreds of briliant transgendered actors, and one of them would have been better suited for the role.  The attempt to use special effects to portray breasts and a lack of external genitalia was very poorly done and obviously fake.However, the story line is excellent and very realistic.  The movie also was clearly intended to be shown outside England, since it does make attempts to make sure viewers understand the nuances of British society.  The self-serving bigotry of coworkers and law enforcement is something anyone around the world can relate to, as are the interpersonal relationships.  The story would play well even without the transgender twist, but the added twist makes the story compelling.",4,A love story with a twist,1152403200,"07 9, 2006",2006,2435,"['very', 'well', 'made', 'tasteful', 'love', 'story', 'based', 'England.The', 'story', 'line', 'up', 'Kim', 'Foyle', 'transsexual', 'woman', 'riding', 'cab', 'work', 'when', 'literally', 'Paul', 'Prentice', 'best', 'friend', 'when', 'was', 'Karl', 'course', 'recognized', 'eventually', 'Paul', 'again.The', 'usual', 'questions', 'confusion', 'come', 'up', 'particularly', 'when', 'Paul', 'falling', 'Kim', 'Paul', 'course', 'heterosexual', 'relationship', 'woman', 'early', 'recognized', 'going', 'nowhere', 'Paul', 'curiosity', 'personal', 'textbook', 'research', 'gender', 'sexuality', 'attempt', 'understand', 'not', 'just', 'best', 'friend', 'himself.Eventually', 'confrontation', 'up', 'when', 'Paul', 'sexually', 'arroused', 'Kim', 'description', 'how', 'hormonal', 'treatments', 'changed', 'appearance', 'eventually', 'arrested', 'indecent', 'exposure', 'Kim', 'also', 'arrested', 'when', 'Paul', 'behalf', 'police', 'vehicle', 'Kim', 'molested', 'one', 'officers', 'Paul', 'defense', 'Paul', 'then', 'beaten', 'other', 'officer', 'assault.Kim', 'threatened', 'prison', 'time', 'men', 'prison', 'abuse', 'police', 'officer', 'testify', 'Paul', 'will', 'unjustly', 'go', 'prison', 'instead', 'British', 'law', 'determines', 'prison', 'go', 'based', 'birth', 'sex', 'Kim', 'will', 'be', 'raped', 'killed', 'sent', 'prison', 'yet', 'also', 'falling', 'best', 'friend', 'must', 'also', 'deal', 'effect', 'whole', 'story', 'having', 'job', 'family.While', 'story', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'bit', 'close', 'home', 'confusing', 'relationships', 'generally', 'do', 'use', 'non-transsexual', 'man', 'role', 'Kim', 'was', 'somewhat', 'distasteful', 'are', 'hundreds', 'briliant', 'transgendered', 'actors', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'suited', 'role', 'attempt', 'use', 'special', 'effects', 'portray', 'breasts', 'lack', 'external', 'genitalia', 'was', 'very', 'poorly', 'done', 'obviously', 'fake.However', 'story', 'line', 'excellent', 'very', 'realistic', 'movie', 'also', 'was', 'clearly', 'intended', 'be', 'shown', 'outside', 'England', 'make', 'attempts', 'make', 'sure', 'viewers', 'understand', 'nuances', 'British', 'society', 'self-serving', 'bigotry', 'coworkers', 'law', 'enforcement', 'something', 'anyone', 'world', 'can', 'relate', 'are', 'interpersonal', 'relationships', 'story', 'would', 'play', 'well', 'even', 'transgender', 'twist', 'added', 'twist', 'story', 'compelling']",N/A

186960,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,157252281X,Martin Asiner,"[12, 14]","There is a scarcity of films dealing with transgender issues.  Of those that do, most focus on the what the movie suggests is the inevitable tragic aftermath of all concerned.  DIFFERENT FOR GIRLS suggests instead a more normal, less tragic plot.  When generations of viewers see movies that punish those who cross the gender line, then those movies subtly and insidiously build up a layer of prejudice that counterbalancing movies that allow a new philosophy of films like DFG to act as a breath of fresh air.This movie has a twin protagonist.  The male is Paul Prentice, well played by Rupert Graves, who comes across as a man with problems but also as one who deep down is really a decent sort.  Years earlier, while in high school, he befriended Karl, a male friend from some nasty towel-snapping bullies in a scene that may bring to mind similar such scenes that all non-jocks must have endured at one time without a white knight rushing to the rescue.  And make no mistake, Prentice is the knight who stands down the bullies, much to the silent gratitude of a young man who has troubles enough with his own issues of latent feminist feelings.  Fast forward ten years.  Karl is now Kim, a male-to-female transsexual.  They meet with the now Kim recognizing Paul, but not the reverse.  When Paul finally learns the truth, the movie delves into some serious areas of the heart which dictate who might like whom and why.  Despite some initial antagonism on Paul's part, he feels an attraction to Kim.  The nature of this attraction might be purely physical.  Kim, played in a surprisingly demure fashion by Steven Mackintosh, really seems to be an attractive woman.  When both finally strip, the illusion on the audience's part that a male actor is playing a MTF trangender is not shattered. Instead, their union is sweet and unaffecting.  They learn to care for each other regardless of the anatomical differences.  It is likely that if there is a subtle message to DFG, it is that the magic of attraction between one person and another need not hinge only on the obviously physical, but on the less obvious emotional.",4,Different For Girls: But How About Boys?,1024790400,"06 23, 2002",2002,2121,"['scarcity', 'films', 'dealing', 'transgender', 'issues', 'do', 'most', 'focus', 'what', 'movie', 'inevitable', 'tragic', 'aftermath', 'concerned', 'DIFFERENT', 'FOR', 'GIRLS', 'instead', 'more', 'normal', 'less', 'tragic', 'plot', 'When', 'generations', 'viewers', 'see', 'movies', 'punish', 'who', 'cross', 'gender', 'line', 'then', 'movies', 'subtly', 'insidiously', 'build', 'up', 'layer', 'prejudice', 'counterbalancing', 'movies', 'allow', 'new', 'philosophy', 'films', 'DFG', 'act', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air.This', 'movie', 'twin', 'protagonist', 'male', 'Paul', 'Prentice', 'well', 'played', 'Rupert', 'Graves', 'who', 'across', 'man', 'problems', 'also', 'one', 'who', 'deep', 'down', 'really', 'decent', 'sort', 'Years', 'earlier', 'high', 'school', 'befriended', 'Karl', 'male', 'friend', 'nasty', 'towel-snapping', 'bullies', 'scene', 'may', 'bring', 'mind', 'similar', 'such', 'scenes', 'non-jocks', 'must', 'have', 'endured', 'one', 'time', 'white', 'knight', 'rushing', 'rescue', 'make', 'mistake', 'Prentice', 'knight', 'who', 'down', 'bullies', 'much', 'silent', 'gratitude', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'troubles', 'enough', 'own', 'issues', 'latent', 'feminist', 'feelings', 'Fast', 'forward', 'ten', 'years', 'Karl', 'now', 'Kim', 'male-to-female', 'transsexual', 'meet', 'now', 'Kim', 'recognizing', 'Paul', 'not', 'reverse', 'When', 'Paul', 'finally', 'truth', 'movie', 'serious', 'areas', 'heart', 'dictate', 'who', 'might', 'like', 'whom', 'why', 'initial', 'antagonism', 'Paul', 'part', 'attraction', 'Kim', 'nature', 'attraction', 'might', 'be', 'purely', 'physical', 'Kim', 'played', 'surprisingly', 'demure', 'fashion', 'Steven', 'Mackintosh', 'really', 'be', 'attractive', 'woman', 'When', 'finally', 'strip', 'illusion', 'audience', 'part', 'male', 'actor', 'playing', 'MTF', 'trangender', 'not', 'shattered', 'Instead', 'union', 'sweet', 'unaffecting', 'learn', 'care', 'other', 'regardless', 'anatomical', 'differences', 'likely', 'subtle', 'message', 'DFG', 'magic', 'attraction', 'one', 'person', 'need', 'not', 'hinge', 'only', 'obviously', 'physical', 'less', 'obvious', 'emotional']",N/A

The movie is only slightly entertaining with Graves being the true reason.No disrespect to Mackintosh (I've seen him in other things and think he's a good actor) but he didn't do it for me in this. He wasn't convincing as a transexual let alone a woman. He didn't even look like a woman but  like a man in make-up. For this movie to be more realistic they could have picked a more feminine-looking male lead or at least a man that can look good in a dress and make-up. Mackintosh, who resembled Glenn Close in the film, looked just like a man in drag instead of a transexual woman. No transexual woman would have left any doctor's office looking like this. Couldn't the film people have applied things to alter Mackintosh's looks better than they did? He didn't look like a woman at all and he didn't even talk like a woman! No one would be fooled that this was a woman and it was pitiful for the filmmakers to think this was convincing. This is what made the film too unrealistic. You couldn't get into the character of Kim (Mackintosh) because he didn't look at all like a woman plus you couldn't buy that Graves's character would find her attractive. At first he seems to be repulsed that his old friend has changed into a woman then he's suddenly sexually attracted to her? It didn't make sense but could have been understood if Mackintosh looked like a woman.There wasn't really a plot except Graves's character Prentess getting into trouble and Kim having to save him from going to jail. Other than that, it's completely wasted. I would have rather seen a film that explored Kim's journey into being a woman and I would have liked to see a drawn out and longer romance. I didn't appreciate how Kim and Prentiss were thrown together sexually twenty minutes before the film ended. It made no sense was no need for it because the two didn't even seem to be attracted to each other until half way into the film.If you're a fan of Graves you'll enjoy this movie a little. He brought the only spark there was to this film. It was boring enough but Graves will keep you watching, maybe. I thought he was great and I loved the character but that wasn't enough to save this film. If you want to see a unique romantic comedy there are much better ones than this. If you want to see a man playing a transexual in a decent way, watch ""Soldier's Girl"". Different for Girls could have been a very good movie if Mackintosh hadn't been in the lead and if the film had a real plot.
