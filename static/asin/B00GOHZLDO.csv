1679929,A12UB42W3M4FTS,B00GOHZLDO,Avid Reader,"[0, 2]","I read the reviews before watching this, but I still expected better for some reason.  It was kind of cute and would have made a good made for TV movie, but it fell short as an actual movie.  I haven't read the book, so I had no preconceptions before watching the movie.  I found it to be poorly directed.  It's difficult for me to put into words.  It seemed to skip things in the plot almost like a synopsis instead of the entire movie.  There were so many plot holes.  They were rather easy to bridge, but it just made watching the movie unenjoyable.  It could have been fantastic, but it was simply poorly directed, maybe even a poorly written movie adaptation with bad acting.I would not have picked Aneurin Barnard to play Mariah.  He just didn't seem to fit the character.  Mariah Mundi was supposed to be 15 years old (from the book -- 17 in the movie), but Aneurin seems much older, too old for this character in my opinion.  I can't put my finger on it, but I wasn't impressed by the acting skills of the Aneurin (Mariah) or Mella Caren (Sacha).  Actually the only ones I did like were Xaviar Atkins (Felix) and Keely Hawes (Catherine Mundi).I absolutely love these kinds of movies.  I watch a lot of children's adventure movies.

1679938,AYG1U47VFZ165,B00GOHZLDO,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[2, 5]","As the technologies required to make a major motion picture slowly start to become more affordable, studios have greater access to the kinds of production requirements needed to compete with the big boys.  Smaller studios can now band together, link up their finances, and bring in some pretty big names to headline films that, just ten years ago, would&#8217;ve cost vastly more capital than it does today.  Such is the case with THE ADVENTURER: THE CURSE OF THE MIDAS BOX, a clever little family-focused adventure starring Michael Sheen, Lena Headey, Ioan Gruffudd, and Sam Neill.  See how far we&#8217;ve come?  20 years ago, Sam Neill was an action star leading Steven Spielberg&#8217;s JURASSIC PARK; today, he&#8217;s the heavy in a $25M mostly direct-to-video release.Progess, eh?(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you&#8217;re the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)Mariah Mundi (played by the fresh-faced Aneurin Barnard, the lead here though he&#8217;s billed down on the slate below the A-listers) is a young man on a quest to find his family: his brother, along with his mother (the reliable Keeley Hawes in a small role) and father (Ioan Gruffudd in an even smaller one), have all been captured by the nefarious Otto Luger, a capitalist hell-bent on finding two halves of a sacred amulet that&#8217;ll give him access to the legendary Midas Box.  Thankfully, Mundi isn&#8217;t left to his own devices, as Charity (the malleable Michael Sheen) and his cohorts at the Bureau of Antiquities are never far behind.  Can they stop Luger before he destroys life as we know it?(Don&#8217;t look for me to spoil it!  You&#8217;ll have to tune in, if you&#8217;re interested, and find out!)THE ADVENTURER tries very hard to be something like those pleasant live-action films that Walt Disney Studios used to specialize in.  Throughout the late 60&#8217;s and 70&#8217;s, Disney produced a terrific library of family-friendly adventures &#8211; some of them period pieces, but most of them contemporary ones with a sci-fi or fantasy theme.  From what I can recall, these things were never drew a huge crowd &#8211; they obviously did respectable business under the familiar logo &#8211; but once Kurt Russell grew up and became Snake Plissken the Mouse House turned its focus back on animation, where they continue to dominate even today.Fashioned in that mold, MIDAS BOX works fairly effectively, though much like those films of the 70&#8217;s it&#8217;s probably just as forgettable.  Director Jonathan Newman probably did the best he could with this adaptation (it&#8217;s all based on a novel by G.P. Taylor), but, as much as he tries to infuse the picture with the fire reminiscent of the INDIANA JONES films or maybe even the Spielberg-produced YOUNG SHERLOCK HOLMES, this ADVENTURER never really soars.  Some of that may be due to the fact that, as a lead, Barnard never has all that much to do but play second fiddle to scenes crafted with greater portions of the meat going to his big name counterparts (Headey&#8217;s gifts as a commanding presence are practically smothered in such a one-note creation, but, at least, she&#8217;s given a range to work with; Sheen gets into a low-brow swashbuckler; and Neill exists mostly at this point in his career to chew scenery).  Heck, one might even make the case that Barnard even bats clean-up for some fairly routine special effect and action sequences, ones that feel a bit too contrived to ratchet-up any legitimate tension in something that&#8217;s obviously billed as an actioner.Still, there&#8217;s something to be said for a film that, perhaps, knew its destiny and embraced it.  On that count, THE ADVENTURER is a relatively benign 90 minutes.  There&#8217;s even the promise of a sequel &#8211; if you&#8217;re still there after the credits &#8211; though I can&#8217;t imagine the kids will be lining up in costume should that flick ever see the light of day.THE ADVENTURER: THE CURSE OF THE MIDAS BOX (2013) is produced by a whole host of participants including Entertainment Motion Pictures (E-MOTION), Arcadia Motion Pictures, and Matador Pictures (to name a few).  DVD distribution is being handled through RLJ Entertainment and Image Entertainment.  As for the technical specifications, the film is sharply made with the best quality sights and sounds available, including some impressive though predictable cinematography.  As is often the case, there&#8217;s only a single special feature &#8211; a making-of short (20 minutes) &#8211; and it serves mostly as a bloated commercial for what you&#8217;ve just seen more than a documentary of what it took to bring the film to life.RECOMMENDED.  As kid-friendly entertainment goes, THE ADVENTURER: THE CURSE OF THE MIDAS BOX remains mostly just that throughout the film, but the last third is hounded by some very dark moments, including fallings-to-death, a near-drowning, and some fairly grisly (though not all that bloody) disintegrations of human beings.  Sure, it&#8217;s all mostly CGI, but when so much of the motion picture was presented as a young thinking person&#8217;s alternative to harsher fare then it only stands to reason that one question the artistic choices of the big finish.  Plus, it doesn&#8217;t quite tie itself up as nicely as one might&#8217;ve wanted: stay tuned after the initial credits for the big reveal which promises a sequel and, in fact, reshapes the whodunit nature in such a hurried way you might be left asking, &#8220;What &#8230;?&#8221;In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at RLJ Entertainment and Image Entertainment provided me with an advance DVD copy of THE ADVENTURER: THE CURSE OF THE MIDAS BOX by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",3,Family-Friendly THE ADVENTURER

For 25 million they did get a movie with great sets and fairly good actors. What they needed was a better screen writer. No doubt if I knew the book, which I assume is aimed at the YA steampunk audience, I would have followed the plot with more clarity. This isn't a bad movie but there are plot jumps that leave you wondering if you missed something while reaching for some popcorn. Definitely needed those transitions that are probably on some cutting room floor. While it seems clear this film was shot with a sequel in mind, you can watch it as a stand alone. Basically if you are home and it's a rainy or snowy day and you want a well shot escapist film to watch then this is a contender. Plot is simple: Before parents disappear they hide two parts of amulet with their children along with a cryptic warning; younger brother gets taken by bad guys; older brother goes in search of younger sibling and gets some help along the way; and relatively happy ending with cliffhanger.

This movie was far from either of those things.The main problem this movie suffers from is that it takes itself too seriously. &#34;Around the World in 80 Days&#34; embraced its own camp and was entertaining as a result. This movie desperately wants to be ranked in a higher caliber, but simply cannot because it puts the story in the hands of two inexperienced youth and weighs down their already limited talent with painful expository dialogue.Despite the movie's attempt to pass itself off as a riveting adventure centered around technology and ancient artifacts, the story moves very slowly trying to build tension, but instead breeding boredom and lessening whatever remote sympathy you ever had with the main character as he continues to blunder in stupidity.

Bleeding profusely, yet refusing medical attention, he pushes on until he can deliver a vital message. A message that has the potential to change the course of history.Reminds me a bit of another YA effort from 2008, 'Under the Mountain' which also starred Sam Neill. And like that film - this adventure/fantasy comes close to being an enjoyable film. It has the right elements, the scenes are visually rich, and the story an interesting twist on an old mythological tale.Tells the story of one Mariah Mundi. He and his younger brother Felix are sons of two famous English explorers. It's his parents that the bleeding man is desperate to see again. After the message is delivered - mom and dad vanish. Suddenly, the privileged and sheltered life he's known is about to be shattered forever.Soon he and Felix are on the streets, hungry and desperate. But even in the flea infested dark corners of society - they're being hunted for reasons they can't understand.For all it's textural quality and exciting premise - this film plays very flat.Most of that can be blamed on Director Jonathan Newman, whose lack of logical storytelling left many aspects of the film unfinished and incomplete. Example: When Mariah and Sacha are trapped in one of the maze cells - he discovers sunlight coming from a broken portion of the wall - it's a way out of their prison.Understandably, Sacha - a simple seamstress - panics at their confinement and begins desperately grasping at the rock wall to widen the opening. Mariah attempts to warn her against such action since it could open the entire hold, which sits precariously several hundred feet above the pounding sea. But how does he know this?What should be an easy explanation becomes another moment where the audience has to mentally bridge the gap. The director should have cut to Mariah also noting sunlight peering from beneath their feet - a simple and quick 2-second scene. One that Newman fails to incorporate. So we aren't rewarded with the Indiana Jones-like moment the director was attempting. &lt;shrug>Scene after scene plays like that. Why does the lowly bellhop carry a key that opens the secret elevator? Why does Mariah reveal his identity to Monica? Why does young Felix use a hatchet when working in the mines? And worse, why does he, or any of the children for that matter, work so hard pounding the rocks which are already rubble and does not lead to the location of the Box itself?Why, why, why.Ack. So many 'whys' that it just killed the movie's energy, leaving the audience struggling to deal with innumerable plot holes.We all know where the details lay. Apparently Director Newman did not.Additionally, I thought Aneurin Barnard was too old for the role. i would've enjoyed the character if he wasn't a twenty-something seemingly trapped in arrested development.

The sets were excellent. They chose some wonderfully locations for shooting. The use of the historic Roman ruins at Bath was great both for the ancient artifact and the Victorian spa aspects. The use of the pumping station was also perfect. Costuming was nice as were props.This is probably one of the best VSF/Steampunk films out there and certainly holds up better than League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.Terry,5,A very nice Steampunk Film,1397952000,"04 20, 2014",2014,531,"['have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'someone', 'who', 'VSF/Steampunk/Ancient', 'Artifacts', 'genre', 'really', 'liked', 'film', 'sets', 'were', 'excellent', 'chose', 'wonderfully', 'locations', 'shooting', 'use', 'historic', 'Roman', 'Bath', 'was', 'great', 'ancient', 'artifact', 'Victorian', 'spa', 'aspects', 'use', 'pumping', 'station', 'was', 'also', 'perfect', 'Costuming', 'was', 'nice', 'were', 'props.This', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'VSF/Steampunk', 'there', 'certainly', 'up', 'better', 'League', 'Extraordinary', 'Gentlemen.Terry']",N/A

1679958,A3S7REHVBOSTLR,B00GOHZLDO,Toni V. Sweeney,"[0, 0]","I got this DVD because I saw the preview included with another movie I'd ordered.  Technically a Young Adult steampunk, it's fast-paced and has enough action for adults, too.After a wounded colleague interrupts his father's lecture and give his mother a broken amulet, young Mariah Mundy's left is turned up-side down. His parents disappear, he and his younger brother Felix end up in a Crown reformatory and Felix is abducted by two mysterious men while Mariah is saved by the same colleague. It seems Captain Charity and Professor Mundy are members of Her Majesty's secret Bureau of Antiquities and they're to prevent Otto Luger from obtaining the Midas Box which not only turns items to gold but is a dead weapon also.Mariah finds himself on the way to an island resort in the North Sea where, with the help of assorted characters and a winsome little seamstress, he will attempt to thwart Luger's plans and rescue Felix.A fairly fast-moving story and while its absence of blunt language and sex may disappoint some, it's an enjoyable story in the Indiana Jones mode.  One trivial point puzzling me at first is that I'd always considered Mariah a girl's name and there was a moment's confusion sorting out it was the male title character. The twist after the end-credits is a teaser for the next movie which I understand has been in &#34;pre-production&#34; since 2012. Since this film was released in 2013 (with apparently little promotion here), that probably means it'll never be completed.  A pity, I'd look forward to it. Unless they hurry, doe-eyed Aneurin Barnard, a 28-year-old playing a 17-year-old, will soon grow out of the part. He's handsome, appealing, and athletic and guess I'll have to look for him in the several other movies listed under his resume.",5,"Appealing Hero, Entertaining Story for All Ages",1404086400,"06 30, 2014",2014,1771,"['got', 'DVD', 'saw', 'preview', 'included', 'movie', ""'d"", 'ordered', 'Technically', 'Young', 'Adult', 'steampunk', 'fast-paced', 'enough', 'action', 'adults', 'too.After', 'wounded', 'colleague', 'father', 'lecture', 'give', 'mother', 'broken', 'amulet', 'young', 'Mariah', 'Mundy', 'left', 'turned', 'up-side', 'down', 'parents', 'disappear', 'younger', 'brother', 'Felix', 'end', 'up', 'Crown', 'reformatory', 'Felix', 'abducted', 'two', 'mysterious', 'men', 'Mariah', 'saved', 'same', 'colleague', 'Captain', 'Charity', 'Professor', 'Mundy', 'are', 'members', 'Her', 'Majesty', 'secret', 'Bureau', 'Antiquities', ""'re"", 'prevent', 'Otto', 'Luger', 'obtaining', 'Midas', 'Box', 'not', 'only', 'items', 'gold', 'dead', 'weapon', 'also.Mariah', 'way', 'island', 'resort', 'North', 'Sea', 'where', 'help', 'assorted', 'characters', 'winsome', 'little', 'seamstress', 'will', 'attempt', 'thwart', 'Luger', 'plans', 'rescue', 'Felix.A', 'fairly', 'fast-moving', 'story', 'absence', 'blunt', 'language', 'sex', 'may', 'disappoint', 'enjoyable', 'story', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'mode', 'One', 'trivial', 'point', 'puzzling', 'first', ""'d"", 'always', 'considered', 'Mariah', 'girl', 'name', 'was', 'moment', 'confusion', 'sorting', 'was', 'male', 'title', 'character', 'twist', 'end-credits', 'teaser', 'next', 'movie', 'understand', 'been', '34', 'pre-production', '34', '2012', 'film', 'was', 'released', '2013', 'apparently', 'little', 'promotion', 'here', 'probably', ""'ll"", 'never', 'be', 'completed', 'pity', ""'d"", 'look', 'forward', 'hurry', 'doe-eyed', 'Aneurin', 'Barnard', '28-year-old', 'playing', '17-year-old', 'will', 'soon', 'grow', 'part', 'handsome', 'appealing', 'athletic', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'have', 'look', 'several', 'other', 'movies', 'listed', 'resume']",N/A
