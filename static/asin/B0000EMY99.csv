781633,A2TMQJD6VMSFHM,B0000EMY99,"Kat Ramone ""katramone""","[6, 6]","I am used to ""Steve Ross,"" and his Yoga routines.  If one is familiar with Ross, one knows that while he knows his yoga, his method is fabulously offbeat!  I find it difficult to do ""other"" yoga routines, especially after being such a dedicated follower of Ross.  This yoga workout, by Karen Voight, was given to me as a gift.  As I requested of my daughter, if she was going to get me a new yoga workout to add to my routines, it had to be at least intermediate level, and it had to be at least 45 minutes long.  Well, with the ""YogaSculpt,"" she came through, as does Karen Voight.  While the poses are familiar to those who practice yoga, ie.:  ""downward dog,"" ""warrior I & II,"" ""child's pose,"" ""chair pose,"" and more, Karen's approach is a relaxing, yet full-body workout/stretch that combines a calm setting with a single instructor (Karen), minimalistic set, and subdued, light classical music.  Karen's calm voice guides the exercisor through a set of standing and sitting poses that as mentioned, are quite intense, yet very relaxing, invigorating, and even challenging for the beginner to intermediate yoga afficionado.  I could feel the intense stretching (these were not ""ouch"" level...rather, the stretches felt great and depending on one's level, one can deepen these stretches to one's level), and my body actually became a bit shaky during some of the poses (from the intensity).  One has the choice of ""mixing and matching"" routines, such as the standing ""flow"" routine and the ""pilates-style"" floor routine, but I do both.  The standing routine really improves flexibility and balance, while the sitting portion really works on strength and balance--especially stabilizing one's abdominal and back muscles.  The brief ending stretch was a relief and it was easy to recover and I felt quite relaxed when the workout was completed.So, if you are a beginner to intermediate level, this is an excellent yoga workout that provides room to improve as well as providing wonderful stretching, breathing and more importantly--relaxation!  Give Karen Voight a try...She is actually good, and I really enjoy the workout.

This is another great workout of hers and at the same time you are working hard, it's also kinda relaxing.The moves here are mixed yoga, pilates and muscle toning.  You will sculpt your body if you do this often and consistantly.  You engage several muscles at a time to get the most benefit, since you are strengthening some muscles and stretching others at the same time.This is a good 42ish minute long dvd that is enjoyable to do because of her great instruction and beautiful set and music.

It will push you - some of the balancing poses will really force you to focus on stabilising your torso so you don't fall, and the warrior/triangle series really makes my legs shake.The workout can be done as a whole, or you can choose from the 25 minute ""Flow Series"" or the 20 minute ""Pilates/Yoga Matwork"" section.I would recommend this to those with some background knowledge of yoga; although Karen's instruction would probably allow a beginner to use proper form, I suspect it may be too challenging.",5,Fantastic workout to challenge you,1170460800,"02 3, 2007",2007,914,"[""'ve"", 'owned', 'DVD', 'while', 'now', 'reason', 'keep', 'forgetting', 'how', 'much', 'enjoy', 'left', 'shelf', 'Then', 'rediscover', 'fall', 'love', 'again.This', 'fantastic', 'challenging', 'yoga/pilates', 'Karen', 'form', 'cueing', 'are', 'exceptional', 'place', 'weight', 'here', 'push', 'foot', 'there', 'bringing', 'own', 'form', 'workout', 'along', 'leaps', 'bounds', 'will', 'push', 'balancing', 'poses', 'will', 'really', 'force', 'focus', 'stabilising', 'torso', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'fall', 'warrior/triangle', 'series', 'really', 'legs', 'shake.The', 'workout', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'whole', 'can', 'choose', '25', 'minute', 'Flow', 'Series', '20', 'minute', 'Pilates/Yoga', 'Matwork', 'section.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'background', 'knowledge', 'yoga', 'Karen', 'instruction', 'would', 'probably', 'allow', 'beginner', 'use', 'proper', 'form', 'suspect', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'challenging']",N/A

Once I have completed this challenging video, I feel stretched, strengthened, toned and very peaceful.  If you are just starting out, be patient with yourself.  Yoga will develop patience, character and strength.  Think of each posture  as a goal; by the third or fourth time, you may achieve what you see.  This video is a combination of Pilates and Yoga.  Ordering a sticky mat is  essential (information is included in video pamphlets) so you don't injure  your muscles by slipping on a carpeted surface.There are no spiritual  references and Karen's calming voice leads you through the poses in her  organized way.  The music is very relaxing and almost makes this the  Nordstrom of Yoga videos.  I recommend walking for at least one half hour  before attempting the stretching exercises.

However, I'm trying to get more into Yoga and Pilates so that I can also lengthen and stretch my muscels.  I am finding it hard to get into this method of exercize, but Karen Voights Yogasculpt is a good starting point.  Most importantly, it is pretty easy to follow - her cuing is very clear and descriptive - so even at points where you can't look at the TV screen, you know what you are doing. (some other ""beginner's Yoga"" DVDs are not so clear)  The only thing I don't like is when Karen uses expressions like ""the other leg"" or ""the front arm"".  I always prefer the instructors to say Right or Left, so there is absolutely no confusion.  I find this DVD somewhat boring and holding some of the poses is a bit tedious, but I guess this is what Yoga is all about.  The abs section does give your stomache a good burn, so you know it's working.  And I have to say, when I'm done my whole body feels great.
