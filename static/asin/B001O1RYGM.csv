1221530,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B001O1RYGM,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[1, 1]","This film is sad on so many levels. The most egregious mistake it makes is with incredibly sloppy camera work, editing, and production. The story is beyond predictible, an open relationship... how will that end? The director did nothing to build tension, conflict, or caring for any of the characters in this film. There is exactly one bright spot in this stinker, Sam, played by the beautiful Courtney Ford.Film production. The film was shot by and large handheld - or the viewer is made to believe it was shot handheld. When a shot should be still, two characters are speaking or critical dialog is being delivered, for absolutely no reason the camera moves. In one tight shot of Sam, she is speaking to Masonn about their relationship. As she speaks the camera pans down to an arm, then back up to her face, then over to Masonn, then back down to the arm, then back up to her face. This circular motion had nothing to do with that moment in the film. In fact there was so much inane camera movement, this viewer was almost sea sick.Production values - frequently a bright light would flare and flash in the corner of the frame, drawing attention away from the more important part of the shot. As a character moves, the flare is covered, and disapperas, with no relationship to the story. This happens over and over in the film. Frequently mirrors show stage lights. Continuity was off, Morgan's band aid is on the right, but later in a bar it has moved to his left cheek. The film is grainy, actually looking more like this was shot on video. Frequently the autofocus of the camera searched out focus, and never found it.The story line has been told over and over again. The lines are delivered in a cardboard manner. Within the first 10 minutes the film is virtually over. There is no surprise, only a small amount of confusion when Sam goes back to Mason's room and they end up in bed together. From then on the shark has jumped.The film is about relationships? That's what the special feature three video segments tell me. That's what all the publicity seems to say. And that is what the reviews seem to say. No a much better premise, this a director / writer that wanted to tell a story from the 60's and 70's with a modern twist. Swingtown is a much better series than this film. Sadly Fling (originally released as Lie To Me), is just not a very interesting film.Rated R for the subject matter and language. Oddly, there is virtually no nudity. In fact this film probably would have improved greatly if there had been at least some level of titilation. It just kind of drones on for 1 hour 40 minutes. Girls talk about the male anatomy a fair amount.The DVD includes some meager bonus features. There are no subtitles. A couple of self serving actor interview video clips. And the classic director track.",2,Don't fling it in your DVD player - fling it in the trash,1237939200,"03 25, 2009",2009,2813,"['film', 'sad', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'most', 'egregious', 'mistake', 'incredibly', 'sloppy', 'camera', 'work', 'editing', 'production', 'story', 'predictible', 'open', 'relationship', 'how', 'will', 'end', 'director', 'did', 'nothing', 'build', 'tension', 'conflict', 'caring', 'characters', 'film', 'exactly', 'one', 'bright', 'spot', 'stinker', 'Sam', 'played', 'beautiful', 'Courtney', 'Ford.Film', 'production', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'large', 'handheld', 'viewer', 'made', 'believe', 'was', 'shot', 'handheld', 'When', 'shot', 'should', 'be', 'still', 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'speaking', 'critical', 'dialog', 'being', 'delivered', 'absolutely', 'reason', 'camera', 'one', 'tight', 'shot', 'Sam', 'speaking', 'Masonn', 'relationship', 'camera', 'down', 'arm', 'then', 'back', 'face', 'then', 'Masonn', 'then', 'back', 'down', 'arm', 'then', 'back', 'face', 'circular', 'motion', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'moment', 'film', 'fact', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'inane', 'camera', 'movement', 'viewer', 'was', 'almost', 'sea', 'sick.Production', 'values', 'frequently', 'bright', 'light', 'would', 'flare', 'flash', 'corner', 'frame', 'drawing', 'attention', 'away', 'more', 'important', 'part', 'shot', 'character', 'moves', 'flare', 'covered', 'disapperas', 'relationship', 'story', 'film', 'Frequently', 'show', 'stage', 'lights', 'Continuity', 'was', 'off', 'Morgan', 'band', 'aid', 'right', 'later', 'bar', 'moved', 'left', 'cheek', 'film', 'grainy', 'actually', 'looking', 'more', 'was', 'shot', 'video', 'Frequently', 'autofocus', 'camera', 'searched', 'out', 'focus', 'never', 'found', 'it.The', 'story', 'line', 'been', 'told', 'over', 'again', 'lines', 'are', 'delivered', 'cardboard', 'manner', 'first', '10', 'minutes', 'film', 'virtually', 'over', 'surprise', 'only', 'small', 'amount', 'confusion', 'when', 'Sam', 'back', 'Mason', 'room', 'end', 'up', 'bed', 'together', 'then', 'shark', 'jumped.The', 'film', 'relationships', 'what', 'special', 'feature', 'three', 'video', 'segments', 'tell', 'what', 'publicity', 'say', 'what', 'reviews', 'seem', 'say', 'No', 'much', 'better', 'premise', 'director', '/', 'writer', 'wanted', 'tell', 'story', '60', '70', 'modern', 'twist', 'Swingtown', 'much', 'better', 'series', 'film', 'Sadly', 'Fling', 'originally', 'released', 'Lie', 'Me', 'just', 'not', 'very', 'interesting', 'film.Rated', 'R', 'subject', 'matter', 'language', 'Oddly', 'virtually', 'nudity', 'fact', 'film', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'improved', 'greatly', 'had', 'been', 'least', 'level', 'titilation', 'just', 'kind', 'drones', '1', 'hour', '40', 'minutes', 'Girls', 'talk', 'male', 'fair', 'amount.The', 'DVD', 'meager', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'subtitles', 'couple', 'self', 'serving', 'actor', 'interview', 'video', 'clips', 'classic', 'director', 'track']",Fling
1221531,A150HXN1PBL3C9,B001O1RYGM,"Edward S. Brown ""Charisma Expert""","[6, 8]","""Fling"" is one of those ""sleeper"" hits. The kind of movie that doesn't have blockbuster appeal, but creates its own cult following on the DVD scene.  Why? Because it challenges conventional thinking in ways that frighten mainstream mores.  To engage in romantic relationships, where each party isn't attempting to the own the other, is counterintuitive to our Judeo-Christian socialization.  ""Fling"" makes an overt commentary that might be missed by the typical viewer--conform or be alone.  Granted, it's difficult to be emotionally detached and compartmentalized when feelings emerge in relationships. But, does the emotional conflict derive because we legitimately feel expectations from love or have we been socialized to respond a certain way, because of the societal scripts we read from? If we respond emotionally from the framework of our socialization, I suspect it'll be the later--we feel emotional connection from our psychological scripts.""Fling"" attempts to dissect and explore the emotional possibilities of ""Free Love."" In keeping with conventional wisdom, Hollywood let's the explorer lose in the end. Not because the idea is preposterous, but because ""Free Love"" would disrupt life as we know it.I highly recommend ""Fling"" to the intellectually enlightened.[...]",4,The Charisma Of  A New Concept.,1248134400,"07 21, 2009",2009,1280,"['Fling', 'one', 'sleeper', 'hits', 'kind', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'blockbuster', 'appeal', 'own', 'cult', 'following', 'DVD', 'scene', 'Why', 'conventional', 'thinking', 'ways', 'frighten', 'mainstream', 'mores', 'engage', 'romantic', 'relationships', 'where', 'party', ""n't"", 'attempting', 'own', 'other', 'counterintuitive', 'Judeo-Christian', 'socialization', 'Fling', 'overt', 'commentary', 'might', 'be', 'missed', 'typical', 'viewer', 'conform', 'be', 'alone', 'Granted', 'difficult', 'be', 'emotionally', 'detached', 'compartmentalized', 'when', 'feelings', 'emerge', 'relationships', 'emotional', 'conflict', 'derive', 'legitimately', 'feel', 'expectations', 'love', 'have', 'been', 'socialized', 'respond', 'certain', 'way', 'societal', 'scripts', 'read', 'respond', 'emotionally', 'framework', 'socialization', 'suspect', ""'ll"", 'be', 'later', 'feel', 'emotional', 'connection', 'psychological', 'scripts', 'Fling', 'attempts', 'dissect', 'explore', 'emotional', 'possibilities', 'Free', 'Love', 'keeping', 'conventional', 'wisdom', 'Hollywood', 'let', 'explorer', 'lose', 'end', 'Not', 'idea', 'preposterous', 'Free', 'Love', 'would', 'disrupt', 'life', 'know', 'it.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Fling', 'intellectually', 'enlightened.', '[', ']']",Fling

1221533,A3I7ZDO69JWRHH,B001O1RYGM,"Matthew Siebert ""~Author and Critic""","[7, 10]","This is one of those movies one is either going to love or either going hate - no in between. As for me, I hated the movie. The only other movie that I would consider on a parallel plane as far as drama goes is Requiem for a Dream. I believe it necessary to review, at least in part, Requiem for a Dream in order to contrast it to Fling.Before I begin the review I believe it necessary to state that the two situational contexts which I'm most emphatic about are as follows; situations which involve substance abuse or situations which involve human sexuality.Requiem for a Dream seemed to be a classic example of bad situations gone worse; the acting was great and couldn't have better shown the dark reality of those addicted to or involved with drugs. While some saw Requiem as unnecessarily pessimistic, I saw it as a harsh reality.Now for Fling, lets start off with the good. The atmosphere was superb, the acting was flawless, and had the drama was very intense. Now, before you dismiss my review as an unsubstantiated contradiction, let me explain what the bad (in my eyes) was.Obviously, the movie was about open relations, hence the title. The issue that I have is that the plot (in my opinion) exemplifies the most pessimistic decisions the characters in the movie could possibly make. Every character in the movie is not only immature and selfish but also lacks any ability to contemplate the actions of their consequence or the capacity to take five seconds out out of their day to contemplate their future.Essentially, I find it grossly offensive that most of the public is going to view this as an archetype for open relationships as oppose to its out of context atypical application in the real world. And yes, I know the point of the movie was to show the bad, dramatic side to open relations; I just feel they took it to an extreme, one which made me feel particularly uncomfortable.",1,Made Me Uncomfortable,1251417600,"08 28, 2009",2009,1900,"['one', 'movies', 'one', 'either', 'going', 'love', 'going', 'hate', 'hated', 'movie', 'only', 'other', 'movie', 'would', 'consider', 'parallel', 'plane', 'as', 'far', 'drama', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'believe', 'necessary', 'review', 'least', 'part', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'order', 'contrast', 'Fling.Before', 'begin', 'review', 'believe', 'necessary', 'state', 'two', 'situational', 'contexts', ""'m"", 'most', 'emphatic', 'about', 'are', 'situations', 'involve', 'substance', 'abuse', 'situations', 'involve', 'human', 'sexuality.Requiem', 'Dream', 'seemed', 'be', 'classic', 'example', 'bad', 'situations', 'gone', 'worse', 'acting', 'was', 'great', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'better', 'shown', 'dark', 'reality', 'addicted', 'involved', 'drugs', 'saw', 'Requiem', 'unnecessarily', 'pessimistic', 'saw', 'harsh', 'reality.Now', 'Fling', 'start', 'good', 'atmosphere', 'was', 'superb', 'acting', 'was', 'flawless', 'had', 'drama', 'was', 'very', 'intense', 'Now', 'dismiss', 'review', 'unsubstantiated', 'contradiction', 'let', 'explain', 'what', 'bad', 'eyes', 'was.Obviously', 'movie', 'was', 'open', 'relations', 'hence', 'title', 'issue', 'have', 'plot', 'opinion', 'most', 'pessimistic', 'decisions', 'characters', 'movie', 'could', 'possibly', 'make', 'character', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'immature', 'selfish', 'also', 'ability', 'contemplate', 'actions', 'consequence', 'capacity', 'take', 'five', 'seconds', 'day', 'contemplate', 'future.Essentially', 'find', 'grossly', 'offensive', 'most', 'public', 'going', 'view', 'archetype', 'open', 'relationships', 'oppose', 'context', 'atypical', 'application', 'real', 'world', 'yes', 'know', 'point', 'movie', 'was', 'show', 'bad', 'dramatic', 'side', 'open', 'relations', 'just', 'feel', 'took', 'extreme', 'one', 'made', 'feel', 'particularly', 'uncomfortable']",Fling

1221535,A3FDEI5P21XX6S,B001O1RYGM,"Steve Kuehl ""SLV Video""","[5, 7]","Aside from Peace Arch trying to market this as a sex flick, the film is actually a well made relationship film. The cover art (front and back) actually shows eight out of the nine sexually related/themed scenes in the film, and the trailer relayed the same, but I understand what sells. To be up front, there is actually no real nudity in this film, so the R rating is mostly for the prolific language and adult themes.The story centers on an open relationship between two young adults that enjoy having outside sexual flings and occasional long term romances with others. The film follows their escapades, family and friend support groups around them, and the inevitable fallout as feelings are developing beyond the standard fare. All the leads (including the new Mr. Superman, a JLo twin, and other good looking young people) play their roles very well and actually make you feel for the events they are playing - no matter how awkward.For an independent production, the quality of the picture and sound were adequate and I have read where quite a few people are happy to see their Kansas City town competently preserved here. The supplements were thorough, including deleted scenes, commentary, a behind the scenes (actually the weakest link as the ""video diary"" dryly narrated by a few of the staff made it mundane) and a music score piece.A worthwhile twenty to thirty-something film that was made with a professional look and some up and coming new stars.",5,Don't let the cover art trick you...,1237593600,"03 21, 2009",2009,1462,"['Aside', 'Peace', 'Arch', 'trying', 'market', 'sex', 'flick', 'film', 'actually', 'well', 'made', 'relationship', 'film', 'cover', 'art', 'front', 'back', 'actually', 'eight', 'nine', 'sexually', 'related/themed', 'scenes', 'film', 'trailer', 'relayed', 'same', 'understand', 'what', 'be', 'up', 'front', 'actually', 'real', 'nudity', 'film', 'R', 'rating', 'mostly', 'prolific', 'language', 'adult', 'themes.The', 'story', 'centers', 'open', 'relationship', 'two', 'young', 'adults', 'enjoy', 'having', 'outside', 'sexual', 'flings', 'occasional', 'long', 'term', 'romances', 'others', 'film', 'escapades', 'family', 'friend', 'support', 'groups', 'inevitable', 'fallout', 'feelings', 'are', 'developing', 'standard', 'fare', 'leads', 'including', 'new', 'Mr.', 'Superman', 'JLo', 'twin', 'other', 'good', 'looking', 'young', 'people', 'play', 'roles', 'very', 'well', 'actually', 'make', 'feel', 'events', 'are', 'playing', 'matter', 'how', 'awkward.For', 'independent', 'production', 'quality', 'picture', 'sound', 'were', 'adequate', 'have', 'read', 'where', 'quite', 'few', 'people', 'are', 'happy', 'see', 'Kansas', 'City', 'town', 'competently', 'preserved', 'here', 'supplements', 'were', 'thorough', 'including', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'commentary', 'scenes', 'actually', 'weakest', 'link', 'video', 'diary', 'dryly', 'narrated', 'few', 'staff', 'made', 'mundane', 'music', 'score', 'piece.A', 'worthwhile', 'twenty', 'thirty-something', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'professional', 'look', 'up', 'coming', 'new', 'stars']",Fling
