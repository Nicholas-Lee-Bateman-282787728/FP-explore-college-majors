In this season you start to see it become more it's own and not so much like the British version (which is still fantastic),5,AWESOME!!!!!!,1380931200,"10 5, 2013",2013,225,"['liked', 'season', 'one', 'then', 'will', 'love', 'season', 'two', 'challenges', 'cars', 'get', 'even', 'better', 'season', 'start', 'see', 'become', 'more', 'own', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'British', 'version', 'still', 'fantastic']",Top Gear: The Complete Second Season

The three guys have great chemistry together--the race driver, the comedian, and the nerd. And they pull of some amazing driving stunts as they ram their jalopies (and finer vehicles) across the American landscape. Consider when they're off-roading 400 miles to Vegas. One of the rules is that their tires don't touch pavement until a certain point. They run up against a blacktop road they must get across, or it's all over. You should see their ingenious solutions. One rolls across on boards on roller pipes; the next tips his SUV on its side and has the first guy winch him across; the third makes a giant loop of carpet and drives over it like its a tank tread. Great fun.",4,Antic automotive fun,1394841600,"03 15, 2014",2014,764,"['Okay', ""'ve"", 'never', 'even', 'seen', 'Brit', 'original', 'sure', 'do', 'American', 'spinoff', 'three', 'guys', 'have', 'great', 'chemistry', 'together', 'race', 'driver', 'comedian', 'nerd', 'pull', 'amazing', 'driving', 'stunts', 'ram', 'jalopies', 'finer', 'vehicles', 'American', 'landscape', 'Consider', 'when', ""'re"", 'off-roading', '400', 'miles', 'Vegas', 'One', 'rules', 'tires', 'do', ""n't"", 'touch', 'pavement', 'certain', 'point', 'run', 'up', 'blacktop', 'road', 'must', 'get', 'over', 'should', 'see', 'ingenious', 'solutions', 'One', 'boards', 'roller', 'pipes', 'next', 'SUV', 'side', 'first', 'guy', 'winch', 'third', 'giant', 'loop', 'carpet', 'tank', 'tread', 'Great', 'fun']",Top Gear: The Complete Second Season
1602745,A2T0DIXULILRQR,B009VY14GA,Kris128183,"[5, 6]","Season 1 of the American Top Gear was solid. It was certainly no worse than the very early seasons of the British Top Gear. That show improved over time until it eventually became the powerhouse that it is today. I don't think that the American Top Gear will get anywhere near that, but Season 2 showed alot of improvement. In Season 1 of US TG, some of the challenges lacked imagination. They were almost an exact copy of the challenges seen in the British Top Gear. In this second season, some of the challenges are still similar to the British TG, but there just as many original challenges. Another improvement is that a few minor changes were made to the show. The format for the celeb laps and interviews was slightly changed, the news segment was removed and this second season uses its own original theme music at the beginning of the show. I liked these changes because it showed that the producers were going to give this show its own identity rather than imitating the British TG which is partly why the Russian and Aussie versions got canned so quick. Perhaps the biggest improvement is that the hosts have alot more fun in this season. In season 1 some of the jokes seemed very scripted and could almost be predicted before they were actually said or before they happened. The humor in this season just comes more naturally and it is funnier than the first season. I recommended season 1 on DVD and since season 2 is a huge overall improvement, I'd say that season 2 is a must have DVD.",5,Big Improvement Over Season 1,1360281600,"02 8, 2013",2013,1499,"['Season', '1', 'American', 'Top', 'Gear', 'was', 'solid', 'was', 'certainly', 'no', 'worse', 'very', 'early', 'seasons', 'British', 'Top', 'Gear', 'show', 'improved', 'time', 'eventually', 'became', 'powerhouse', 'today', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'American', 'Top', 'Gear', 'will', 'get', 'anywhere', 'Season', '2', 'showed', 'alot', 'improvement', 'Season', '1', 'US', 'TG', 'challenges', 'lacked', 'imagination', 'were', 'almost', 'exact', 'copy', 'challenges', 'seen', 'British', 'Top', 'Gear', 'second', 'season', 'challenges', 'are', 'still', 'similar', 'British', 'TG', 'there', 'just', 'many', 'original', 'challenges', 'improvement', 'few', 'minor', 'changes', 'were', 'made', 'show', 'format', 'celeb', 'laps', 'interviews', 'was', 'slightly', 'changed', 'news', 'segment', 'was', 'removed', 'second', 'season', 'own', 'original', 'theme', 'music', 'beginning', 'show', 'liked', 'changes', 'showed', 'producers', 'were', 'going', 'give', 'show', 'own', 'identity', 'rather', 'imitating', 'British', 'TG', 'partly', 'why', 'Russian', 'Aussie', 'versions', 'got', 'canned', 'so', 'quick', 'Perhaps', 'biggest', 'improvement', 'hosts', 'have', 'alot', 'more', 'fun', 'season', 'season', '1', 'jokes', 'seemed', 'very', 'scripted', 'could', 'almost', 'be', 'predicted', 'were', 'actually', 'said', 'happened', 'humor', 'season', 'just', 'more', 'naturally', 'funnier', 'first', 'season', 'recommended', 'season', '1', 'DVD', 'season', '2', 'huge', 'overall', 'improvement', ""'d"", 'say', 'season', '2', 'must', 'have', 'DVD']",Top Gear: The Complete Second Season
