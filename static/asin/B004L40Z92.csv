1412916,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B004L40Z92,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[15, 16]","Thank goodness England's Whitechapel district is infamous for its many heinous crimes. Else how could a show initially tailored around Jack the Ripper go on, let alone thrive? There's gratifying news of a Series 3 being worked on and scheduled for a 2012 airing, so sighs of relief, sighs of relief. Meantime, WHITECHAPEL Series 2 revives one of the most notorious eras in East End lore: the reign of the murderous Kray twins, them nattily-attired crime lords what often resorted to torture and murder. And here you thought Britain in the 1960s was only known for the Beatles.The brilliant cast of actors reprises them roles. Series 2 opens with the East End's homicide unit attending a policeman banquet and still soaking in the humiliation of having allowed the Jack the Ripper copy cat to scarper. Except that it's worth it to hear Detective Sergeant Ray Miles (Phil Davis), ornery as ever and up for a commendation, deliver a scathing acceptance speech. We also learn that his ostracized DI, Joseph Chandler (Rupert Penry-Jones), is still on a career fast track. Chandler is covertly promised the next big case.A gristly corpse surfaces, and it doesn't take a forensics expert to note them marks of a savage mutilation. More killings and further evidence point toward a horrifying conclusion, and uninvited local historian Edward Buchan (Steve Pemberton)'s opinion is merely icing on the cake: Someone is replicating the notorious Kray murders. And for our three core characters, pursuit of this investigation would lead down very dark roads. While Jack the Ripper's atrocities originated from the more distant Victorian period, the Krays and their fearmongering Federation of Crime are near enough to now that they're practically breathing down everyone's neck. There are secrets and personal associations unearthed. It's a bit jarring to see the no-nonsense DS Miles rendered all panicky and the normally enthused Edward Buchan so cowed by the unfolding turn of events. As the detectives come to learn, the Federation of Crime is alive and well, its warped influence still corrupting the East End. And if their syndicate yet lurks, what of the Krays?This is what's known as stepping it up. There's historical attention to detail and great texture. There's a rich atmosphere, but it's a different sort from the original series. WHITECHAPEL Series 2 is neither as gothic nor as darkly evocative. But it makes up for that with its sense of sweeping paranoia and the climate of terror fostered by the Krays' dark legend. The case penetrates deeper into the investigators' personal lives, impacts more devastatingly. We get a peek inside DI Chandler. We find out that his OCD is more crippling than he'd let on. But we also find out that Chandler and Miles' personal and working relationship, while still touchy, is quietly growing solid as bedrock. The posh and by-the-book DI still isn't quite in the same step as his blue-collar homicide divisioin, but there's respect there now. However, Miles - who looks somewhat like an older, saner Gary Busey - still scoffs at that amateur expert on local murders, Edward Buchan. So soak in that palpable character conflict.The Krays' influence is insidious and comprehensive. The homicide unit faces threats on their families and betrayal from within. The three episodes are so absorbing. There are twists and turns and gruesome killings and moments in which the menace oozing from the villains is simply palpable. Which makes it all the more rousing when our guys finally begin to turn the tide. I love Chandler's bloody sparring in the gym, this allowing him a moment to engage in asskickery. If you're in the mood for a superior and stylish psychological thriller, see this one. And then keep an eye out for this mismatched team of sleuths' next nasty puzzler in Series 3.The DVD's bonus material:- 4 Deleted Scenes (totaling 00:07:36 minutes), including an extended boxing scene- ""Brothers Grim: Iconography of the Krays"" - delving into the facts and mythology of the Kray Twins (00:07:23 minutes long)- ""Suited & Booted: Re-creating the Krays Image"" - the cast & crew talk about the process of integrating the Kray Twins mythos into the show (00:06:15 minutes long)",5,"""You are surrounded by dark forces, gentlemen.

1412917,A4FX5YCJA630V,B004L40Z92,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[0, 0]","This is a sequel to the incomparableWhitechapelmini-series, a crime thriller in which contemporary police go up against a copy-cat Jack the Ripper, using historical precedent to predict his moves and catch him before he kills again. It was one of the best crime dramas I've ever seen, combining strong characterization with a suspenseful plot and plenty of historical insight into the most famous serial killer of all time.Given that it was very much a standalone story, I was surprised to discover that there was a second series (followed by a third and soon-to-be fourth). But any excuse to revisit this premise and these characters was fine by me. At the end of the original series, highly-strung Joe Chandler was permanently paired up with old dog Ray Miles - two complete opposites who nevertheless make an effective team, especially when combined with Edward Buchan, a rather pompous yet enthusiastic history expert who fancies himself an amateur sleuth.However, since the botched Ripper case, Chandler is feeling inert. He gets no respect from the higher-ups in the police force and is stuck doing menial work in the slums of Whitechapel. At an awards evening, Miles further antagonizes his peers by calling them out on their ""punishment"" of Chandler, who chose to save Miles's life instead of catching the Ripper. The next day a body is found floating in the river, but for some reason the pathologist's report of its injuries results in Miles having a panic attack.Soon enough the truth comes out: it reminded Miles of a murder back in the 1960s when the infamous Kray brothers, Ronnie and Reggie, ruled over the East End. Buchan is thrilled at this news, as it means that another copycat killer is on the loose - this time recreating the iconic murders committed by the Kray twins. Miles lives in fear of the Kray legacy, as not only was his father involved in the crime syndicate, but he well remembers what the East End was like when the Krays were in charge: they fixed jurors, intimidated police, bribed politicians and cast a net of fear over everyone.Things quickly go from bad to worse: the hospital has an influx of stab victims who refuse to elaborate on their injuries, one of Chandler's men is attacked as he interviews witnesses, and the team begins to suspect that there is a conspiracy that goes right to the top of the police force. Then shocking news emerges - that Ronnie Kray fathered two twin boys via artificial insemination. No longer dealing with copycat murders, Chandler and Miles find themselves up against an entire crime syndicate, corrupt cops, and two brothers who are determined to carry on their father's legacy.""Whitechapel"" is high-quality drama, and it's only because the first series was so perfect that the sequel falls just a little bit short. When the characters were dealing with Jack the Ripper, the pacing and suspense was flawless - this was to be expected considering there was a clear sequence of historical murders that were being recreated, giving the police ample time to come up with theories and suspects and counter-attempts to thwart the killer. It was like watching a cat-and-mouse game, with the world's most famous serial killer as the prize.Here, the Kray twins do not carry the same mystique (living outside Britain, I'd never heard of them before) and the story feels a bit more formulaic. Whereas the facts and legends surrounding Jack the Ripper provided a rich source of inspiration from which to build a story (as well as five definitive murders), the Kray brothers are simultaneously less mysterious, and less iconic. Despite some famous murders, as members of a crime syndicate they could have pulled off any number of killings over the years. To compensate for this, there are a lot of added subplots, such as the truth behind Miles's father and Chandler's struggles with OCD, to the point where the story begins to get a little cluttered.But this is just nit-picking. The truth is, ""Whitechapel"" is exciting and informative, and it's only in comparison with its first season that it falters - which in itself is high praise. Its real strength lies in the chemistry between its three leads: on the surface, Chandler and Miles and Buchan have absolutely nothing in common. Chandler is an ambitious, neurotic young man, Miles is a by-the-book copper, and self-important Buchan just likes solving a mystery. Most of the time, Miles can't stand Buchan. And yet when they're put together, they make a formidable team. Having a younger man as the senior officer to two much older men makes for an unusual dynamic, and the way in which they bond with each other has rewarding payoff later down the track.Like the first series, the story is spread out over three episodes, and retains the stylistic inclusion of disconcerting flashes of the past that are interspersed with the contemporary investigation. Though it deals with some grisly subject matter, the gore and violence is never gratuitous, and there are plenty of twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat. There's also lots of detail and foreshadowing at work that makes subsequent re-watches all the more satisfying. I'm currently halfway through series three, and it's still a sophisticated, immersive, intelligent show, and well worth the effort to get hold of it.",5,"""You Are the Only Person in the World Trying
