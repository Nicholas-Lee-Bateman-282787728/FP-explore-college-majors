Basically, you need a very short list of things to decide whether or not to watch &#34;Get Backers&#34; - here it is:1 - you must like comedy anime w/ characters who have really cool & downright FUN &#34;special powers&#34; (unlike traditional superheroes w/ godlike strength, flight, invincibility, etc.2 - you must love to laugh from deep in your belly!3 - you must enjoy characters who are devoted & irreplaceable &#34;besties&#34;, watching them live day to day (with terrible financial luck!) and fighting w/ their own self-induced antics, so LOONY they just can't seem to outgrow stumbling into mess after mess, trying to make a buck & constantly &#34;spending&#34; more than they're going to be paid just to solve the case! So they're always on the verge of starving as their other friends roll their collective eyes at their perpetual bad luck & immaturity.4 - you must enjoy the formerly more common, longer series (over 2 episodes, GB is 40 episodes) that is both affordable and again, very hysterical!If you can meet those 4 requirements (or even just a couple of 'em) then Get Backers is going to be one of your favorites, at minimum in its genre - just as it is one of mine!! And it will likely make it into your collection ASAP after watching just a few episodes! &#128514;Hope you enjoy!

I haven't gotten to the point of caring what makes them tick, and the girl is one of those silly, happy, &#34;little sister&#34; type chicks, so there's not really a relationship, that I wish would happen, to keep me watching.There is a moderate amount of action, but it's not really exciting.

Storywise, it is damn good and not given near enough credit(the scene with the girl trying to leave at the end of the Makubex arc says it all), though at many points the execution of the story and dialogue is a little lacking and cheesy. I don't really think you can hold much of that against the series itself given the nature of translations and subtitling in general. Combine that with some badass characters(even if their abilities are random as hell, hence many of the X-Men comparisons) if you can suffer past the annoying as hell violen girl episodes you should enjoy it.

It's a series that hasn't really been pushed, but it's an excellent series worth checking out by anyone who considers themselves a fan of anime. First the very few, and overlookable, issues. One is the american voice acting: it's terrible. This series should never be watched with the american voicing on....period. Secondly, the animation takes some getting used to. It seems a little funny, but after a while you begin to appreciate the good qualities of the animation. Now that thats outta the way...The best thing about the series is its characters. Ginji and Ban are two of the most likeable anime characters I have seen. Despite their special powers, they are realistic. They have very real problems: they are constantly broke, their car is constantly towed away, they are constantly trying to find work, and they even have to sleep in thei car. Luckily, they have good friends in Natsume and a guy who owns a coffee shop, so they never starve, or at least not to the point of death. We're later introduced to other characters who are also well developed and pretty likeable, if not always. The beginning of the series plays out like a case of the week type thing, where the GetBackers get retrieval cases where they have to get stolen items back to their clients. However, the best part of the series comes with the Infinity Fortress arc, which takes us and many of the characters we have met already to Ginji's old home, the Infinity Fortress. Here we meet most of the rest of the cast who will join the series as regulars later. After this arc, the story putters out a bit, but it remains interesting because of it's characters. Heck, the series could be about how likeable Ginji and Ban are and it would still be worth a watch. Combining this with nice animation, especially during battles, a good dose of humor, continually interesting stories, and nice music, you can't go wrong with GetBackers.",5,One of the better series you'll find available.,1125792000,"09 4, 2005",2005,1953,"['GetBackers', 'something', 'hidden', 'treasure', 'series', ""n't"", 'really', 'been', 'pushed', 'excellent', 'series', 'checking', 'out', 'anyone', 'who', 'fan', 'anime', 'First', 'very', 'few', 'overlookable', 'issues', 'One', 'american', 'voice', 'acting', 'terrible', 'series', 'should', 'never', 'be', 'watched', 'american', 'voicing', '.period', 'Secondly', 'animation', 'getting', 'used', 'little', 'funny', 'while', 'begin', 'appreciate', 'good', 'qualities', 'animation', 'Now', 'thats', 'outta', 'way', 'best', 'thing', 'series', 'characters', 'Ginji', 'Ban', 'are', 'two', 'most', 'likeable', 'anime', 'characters', 'have', 'seen', 'special', 'powers', 'are', 'realistic', 'have', 'very', 'real', 'problems', 'are', 'constantly', 'broke', 'car', 'constantly', 'towed', 'away', 'are', 'constantly', 'trying', 'find', 'work', 'even', 'have', 'sleep', 'thei', 'car', 'Luckily', 'have', 'good', 'friends', 'Natsume', 'guy', 'who', 'coffee', 'shop', 'never', 'starve', 'least', 'not', 'point', 'death', ""'re"", 'later', 'introduced', 'other', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'also', 'well', 'developed', 'pretty', 'likeable', 'not', 'always', 'beginning', 'series', 'out', 'case', 'week', 'type', 'thing', 'where', 'GetBackers', 'get', 'retrieval', 'cases', 'where', 'have', 'get', 'stolen', 'items', 'back', 'clients', 'However', 'best', 'part', 'series', 'Infinity', 'Fortress', 'arc', 'many', 'characters', 'have', 'met', 'already', 'Ginji', 'old', 'home', 'Infinity', 'Fortress', 'Here', 'meet', 'most', 'rest', 'cast', 'who', 'will', 'join', 'series', 'regulars', 'later', 'arc', 'story', 'putters', 'out', 'bit', 'interesting', 'characters', 'Heck', 'series', 'could', 'be', 'how', 'likeable', 'Ginji', 'Ban', 'are', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'watch', 'Combining', 'nice', 'animation', 'especially', 'battles', 'good', 'dose', 'humor', 'continually', 'interesting', 'stories', 'nice', 'music', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'GetBackers']",N/A
834736,A2Y8YMZS7YNEA3,B0002I83RM,Joyce Duhaine,"[0, 2]","When I first watched Get Backers a while back, I found it almost impossible to get past the first couple episodes. The ""powers"" they have just seem a little TOO powerful (and the whole ultra-hypnosis power is just a little TOO hokey and can obviously be used by the writers whenever they write themselves into a corner...It was all a DREAM!). I forced myself to continue after a couple days break and surprisingly it started to get better - and KEPT getting better.Ep. 3, where Ginji & Ban attempt to recover a box filled with 'platinum' is where the characters finally started to grow on me - and episode 4 ""Transport service Vs recovery Service"" is where the story really drew me in. Only 4 episodes in and already we begin to doubt the Get Backers powers as they butt heads with some VERY sinister nemeses. The last episode on Volume One culminates with the expected - and mandatory - battle that have become so cliched in anime since DBZ arrived in America. But as far as the whole 'good-guy vs bad-guy' battles go, this one was pretty darned good.Subsequent volumes in season one are as good - if not better - and I really am glad I stuck with this one (The Violin episodes were only fair though). If you're a teenager, you'll probably love this show without hesitation due to the large number of fights and battles - but I also recommend this to the die-hard anime fans out there who cringe at the thought of collecting any 'mainstream' anime - at least rent the first volume and see how you feel after seeing the first five episodes.One word of warning - unless you were just CAPTIVATED by the voicework in Captain Planet, make sure to watch it in Japanese with the subtitles.Shotaru Morikobu (Ginji) and something-Canna (Ban) are just great in their roles and are a large reason why the show became such a success, IMO. They're not just reading a script - they're ACTING.(I have not seen season two yet so cannot comment on that box set. I know that Morikubo-san and Canna-san are recurring but don't know if they have the same director/producers/ or if the animation looks the same.)(If you like the whole idea of having superpowers, but only using them sparingly in rare occasions AND enjoy romance in your anime, try out ""Kimagure Orange Road"", one of modern anime's founding fathers from the late 80's.)",4,"Hard-Core Anime Fans, Stick With It",1202860800,"02 13, 2008",2008,2315,"['When', 'first', 'watched', 'Get', 'Backers', 'while', 'back', 'found', 'almost', 'impossible', 'get', 'first', 'couple', 'episodes', 'powers', 'have', 'just', 'seem', 'little', 'TOO', 'powerful', 'whole', 'ultra-hypnosis', 'power', 'just', 'little', 'TOO', 'hokey', 'can', 'obviously', 'be', 'used', 'writers', 'whenever', 'write', 'corner', 'was', 'DREAM', 'forced', 'continue', 'couple', 'days', 'break', 'surprisingly', 'started', 'get', 'better', 'KEPT', 'getting', 'better.Ep', '3', 'where', 'Ginji', 'Ban', 'attempt', 'recover', 'box', 'filled', ""'platinum"", 'where', 'characters', 'finally', 'started', 'grow', 'episode', '4', 'Transport', 'service', 'Vs', 'recovery', 'Service', 'where', 'story', 'really', 'drew', 'Only', '4', 'episodes', 'already', 'begin', 'doubt', 'Get', 'Backers', 'powers', 'butt', 'heads', 'VERY', 'sinister', 'nemeses', 'last', 'episode', 'Volume', 'One', 'expected', 'mandatory', 'battle', 'have', 'become', 'so', 'cliched', 'anime', 'DBZ', 'arrived', 'America', 'as', 'far', 'whole', ""'good-guy"", 'vs', 'bad-guy', 'battles', 'go', 'one', 'was', 'pretty', 'darned', 'good.Subsequent', 'volumes', 'season', 'one', 'are', 'good', 'not', 'better', 'really', 'am', 'glad', 'stuck', 'one', 'Violin', 'episodes', 'were', 'only', 'fair', ""'re"", 'teenager', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'love', 'show', 'hesitation', 'due', 'large', 'number', 'fights', 'battles', 'also', 'recommend', 'die-hard', 'anime', 'fans', 'out', 'there', 'who', 'cringe', 'thought', 'collecting', ""'mainstream"", 'anime', 'least', 'rent', 'first', 'volume', 'see', 'how', 'feel', 'seeing', 'first', 'five', 'episodes.One', 'word', 'warning', 'were', 'just', 'CAPTIVATED', 'voicework', 'Captain', 'Planet', 'make', 'sure', 'watch', 'Japanese', 'subtitles.Shotaru', 'Morikobu', 'Ginji', 'something-Canna', 'Ban', 'are', 'just', 'great', 'roles', 'are', 'large', 'reason', 'why', 'show', 'became', 'success', 'IMO', ""'re"", 'not', 'just', 'reading', 'script', ""'re"", 'ACTING', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'season', 'two', 'yet', 'so', 'can', 'not', 'comment', 'box', 'set', 'know', 'Morikubo-san', 'Canna-san', 'are', 'recurring', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'have', 'same', 'director/producers/', 'animation', 'same', 'like', 'whole', 'idea', 'having', 'superpowers', 'only', 'using', 'sparingly', 'rare', 'occasions', 'enjoy', 'romance', 'anime', 'try', 'out', 'Kimagure', 'Orange', 'Road', 'one', 'modern', 'anime', 'founding', 'fathers', 'late', '80']",N/A
