An excellent cast, a great visual style, and an engaging story all add up to make a great installment of this series.The story revolves around David and Celia, a married couple from L.A. who have recently moved to suburban Wisconsin (the town, which is never named, appears to be a suburb of Madison or Milwaukee).  David is an ER doctor and Celia a stay-at-home freelance investigative reporter.  After their first day of unpacking, they go out for a romantic evening and come home a little tipsy.  As they pull into their cul-de-sac, the car slams into a neighbor's brick mailbox and promptly destroys it.  After finding no one home, David leaves a note on the door and they head over to their house.  The next day they head back over to the neighbor's and find the mailbox is back together as if nothing had happened.  They go knock on the door and meet their neighbor, Harold Thompson, a very friendly bachelor.  They are invited in for coffee and have a nice conversation.  From there, things tumble into the depths of psychosis as secrets begin to unravel and we begin to learn more and more about Harold and his depraved life.Family is one of those movies where I had the feeling that there was going to be a HUGE twist at the end and there certainly is.  It was shocking and satisfying, and well worth the hour spent watching.  I don't want to give much more away, but if you are a fan of Masters of Horror and haven't yet picked this one up, go ahead and do it!

1034443,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000KJTFB6,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","I have definitely found the consistency of Showtime's ""Masters of Horror"" anthology series problematic. I was thrilled by the conceit, pleased by the selection of talented directors, but somewhat mystified by some of the actual episodes. The second season, in particular, started out rather unimpressively. John Landis, who clocked in last season with ""Deer Woman,"" returns with ""Family."" While many people didn't care for ""Deer Woman"" (about a woman with a deer body, in case you don't understand the title)--it was, at least, humorous and bizarre. I wouldn't have recommended that episode, either, but it attempted something different.When I saw the preview for ""Family,"" I was pretty stoked. It didn't, however, look horrifying--it seemed to be relying on the comedy angle. That's cool, I enjoy comedy/horror. After watching the episode, though, I think it's fair to say that it's not funny enough to be a comedy, not scary enough to be a thriller, not particularly original, and the twist ending was telegraphed a mile away.George Wendt stars as an ideal suburban husband who is not what he seems at first glance. His family, after all, isn't alive--and they're not even his real family. They are skeletons that he has accumulated from various victims through the years. When a young couple moves in across the way, he becomes infatuated with the wife. He thinks she might be an excellent addition to his brood.What follows should be a fun game of cat-and-mouse, but it just doesn't get going. I think the main problem is the tone. Meant to be a satire, most of it comes across flat. Wendt, who should be having a ball, delivers a one-note performance. You might smile a few times, but this is ultimately forgettable.

1034444,A18IQME5DCSH2L,B000KJTFB6,"Madelyn Pryor ""Goblyn Queen""","[2, 3]","Bare Bones (Quick facts):Family is the latest offering in the Masters of Horror series. This time, director John Landis (American Werewolf in London, Animal House) lends his unique vision to the horror genre. The result is a campy little horror movie that's very enjoyable.The Meat of the Matter (The plot):Harold Thompson is a mild mannered man with a penchant for 1950's decorating, good family values, and gospel music. He also likes to kill people and use their bodies to construct dummies in order to have the perfect family. One day a new couple moves in. They are his neighbors and become his friends. But when Harold starts coveting his neighbor's wife, he decides it might be time to trade in his old wife and get a new member of the family... but first he has to get rid of her husband.Viscera (My ramblings):Family is one of the better offerings from Masters of Horror. I liked the corpse scenes, nice and gross. The acting is a little flat and the interactions a bit too staged. No one has manners as nice as these neighbors! Watching this you can tell George Wendt's performance seems off slightly, like a copy of a copy. The rest of the acting is wooden as well. The plot seems to drag at some spots. However, over all, I really liked this installment. The dark humor is great, and the morality play ending is spectacular. If you like Tales from the Crypt or Alfred Hitchcock presents, I think you'll really like the episode.

This film has an incredible script written by Brent Hanley and with Landis's amazing direction skills it's no wonder this is the best Masters Of Horror DVD to be released from the second season. It mixes humor, suspense, mystery, and horror all into one nasty episode. Give Brent Hanley a hell of a lot of credit for this story because it's one of the most powerful elements ""Family"" has going for it.George Wendt has become a very convincing psycho with ""The King Of The Ants"" and now ""Family"".

George Wendt of 'Cheers' fame is your average, polite neighbour who is secretly killing people and setting up their skeletons as his own 'family.' When a new couple moves in down the road, he becomes obsessed with the hot wife and decides to add her to his collection.'Family' mixes elements of horror, suspense, and satire. I agree with other reviewers that it doesn't ever focus enough on one element to truly standout in that category, but it's still an engaging tale with a strong script and good direction.
