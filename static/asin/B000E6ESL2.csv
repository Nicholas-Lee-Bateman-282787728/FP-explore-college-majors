Really.The cinematography is disturbing, almost a swirling mess. You keep trying to figure out what the h*** is going on.  In the end, you ask does any of this matter at all?The plot concerns a troubled psychiatrist who tries to help his suicidally-depressed patient who is an art history student.  The doctor's wife is an artist who has tried to kill herself too. Or is she?He's  really just a substitute for the student's usual psychiatrist who is off, one way or another.One reviewer said this was not your usual movie NYC.  They got that right, While I lived in New York for decades, I could identify almost nothing. (Yes, I recognized the Brooklyn Bridge.)It is the New York not of movies or reality,  but of nightmares.See it if you want. Let it freak you out a little. But don't try to figure it out.

It's a silly, perplexing psychological thriller, featuring some good performances, but is ultimately dressed up like one of those pretentious Euro trash video installations. Stay is a dreamy, surreal exercise in what is imagined, a world of delusion and illusion, where the lines between reality and fantasy are constantly crossed; it's just a pity that through most of the film, it's not clear what is going on.Henry (Ryan Gosling) is a damaged and disturbed young student, who starts seeing a psychiatrist, Dr. Sam Foster (Ewan McGregor). He's been hearing voices and he can't deal with the fact that his parents died a horrible, blistering, scorching death in a car accident on the Brooklyn Bridge. Henry tells the doctor that he's going to kill himself on Saturday at midnight, so they only have 3 days to talk.Sam lives with Lila, his girlfriend (Naomi Watts). She teaches art and worries that her own work doesn't pass muster. Lila once tried to commit suicide and Sam worries that she might try it again, even though she now realizes that life is too full of beauty.  Sam becomes steadily more obsessed and worried about Henry and goes looking for him around the city, bumping into acquaintances of the young man - an actress-waitress (Elizabeth Reaser) who used to serve Henry pecan pie at a diner, a recently-blinded gentleman (Bob Hoskins) who may be his father, Henry's former doctor (Janeane Garofalo) whom he apparently drove nuts, and his supposedly dead mother (Kate Burton).As Sam discovers more about his patient, the movie begins to drift into a bizarre dreamlike territory and there's a real sense of spiritual and emotional anxiety from all the characters. Henry shows his emotions intensely and you see the inner turmoil that's going on inside his head. You feel his grief and pain - especially when he burns himself with a cigarette on a subway train.However, the problem with Stay is that Forster isn't devoted to seriously understanding the human experience of his characters or the precarious connections that are purported to exist between their physical world and the sacred spiritual beyond. Stay's cheap window dressing - the flashy, conceited visual effects, and the irritating jump cut editing, simply exists to blind us from the fact that its story is pretty slender, mechanical, even soulless.

969756,A3B1V3AUUV13R6,B000E6ESL2,Adrien Caldwell,"[4, 5]","I guess I could say that I now finally understand this film. As one reviewer stated, this film has to do with a man dying on a road but as he is dying his mind recreates a reality that changes life's events and nothing seems to makes sense. I'm glad I didn't know this before watching the film because otherwise it may not have been so much fun trying to figure out what was real or not. I would have simply said to myself, ""Oh, that's just his subconcious crossing over to his conscious mind. Nothing is going to make any sense."" Or, ""fasten your seatbelts, because the subconscious mind is one bumpy illogical road."" In getting back to the actual reason for these minsconstrued events, when it comes to the human mind, there are NO limits, no barriers. The subconscious mind still baffles even the most astute psychiatrists. So when you take a man who has had a trauma to his brain and it starts hemmorhaging one cannot argue the possibilities of what will occur in his head. Tapping into memories, and very uncomfortable emotions like guilt and fear, the sky's the limit.I enjoyed the movie's visuals. Most people haven't even commented on the designs of most scenes. All the mid century mod-like furnishings were gorgeous. A lot of effort was put into creating all of this.Back to other details. I noticed that Ewan's character was wearing ""flood-like"" pants but I thought he was just odd and quirky that way. Just like the people who actually did wear pants that way back in the 70's. But to now read about it by other reviewers as to why this was the case makes me think, 'how clever!' And the movie just keeps unraveling for me weeks later and I keep on thinking about it.  The title for this film is very appropriate as I keep pondering this film weeks later.One thing I found very intriguing had to do with Naomi's character and how she changed ""careers"" within a matter of minutes. Those of you who have seen this film know what I am talking about. I wonder, since this is all coming from the dying mind of Gosling's character, if this was his method of projecting his self hatred onto others and seeing them in the same light. But only, however, to change the facts (or to simply make yourself believe something else) that very moment right before you die. Did he purposely cause that car wreck that killed everyone in it or was it a blown tire and simply an accident? If it wasn't an accident, no wonder the phrase ""forgive me"" was written on the wall several thousand times. Did Naomi's character really try to commit suicide? Remember, in one scene she said something to the effect of, ""I wonder if people will remember me."" She was doubting her value as a human being and thought she didn't mean much.  But towards the end she's now a nurse? Does that mean that nurses are more memorable than suicidal artists, or more valued? Was her being a suicidal artist simply a reflection (or rather a projection) of himself for those few last moments while dying on that bridge?This is why I liked the movie so much. It doesn't really have closure. Not much really makes sense. But it is an idea, a concept and I enjoy thinking about the possibilities as to how the human mind operates. I don't need a perfectly told story nor a perfect ending for a movie to get 5 stars in my book. In real life, not everything makes sense. This movie is like a well done painting by a very complex artist. As you study it and get feedback from others you continue to get more from it and understand it.As Bob Hoskin's character said, ""The Buddists had it right all along!

969758,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B000E6ESL2,Alistair McHarg,"[0, 2]","Stay is a wonderful movie to watch, by which I mean, it is a wonderful movie to look at.  Cinematography is superb, the entire film seems distant and surreal, a feeling reinforced by the haunting, chilly blue/gray wash.  Art direction is equally inspired.  The architecture and interior design are eye-popping - this is certainly a well-endowed university/hospital!  Add to this the clever, (if not painfully and blatantly clever), camera moves where people, settings, and situations morph into one another - and you have a film that is eager to delight the eye.The problem is that this is the only part of you that is delighted.  I won't give away the gadget, such as it is, but I will say that the nature of the gadget necessitates a distance from the protagonists, all the key players are held at arm's length, even the tormented Henry.  Everyone we meet in Stay has gone through some sort of catastrophic event, and yet, we feel no sympathy at all.  This is because we never get to know them; all we're really aware of is the deliberate confusion.  The movie is staggeringly slow; it is rather like watching exotic and beautiful tropical fish swirling lazily in a tank - if one of them eats another  - who cares?Ryan Gosling is very good as Henry, but one wonders why he would reprise his role from the splendid film, United States Of Leland, so blatantly, seems risky.  A really terrific cast is given almost nothing to do, Naomi Watts, Elizabeth Reaser, Bob Hoskins, and Janeane Garofalo appear - and I use the word advisedly - give us the benefit of their recognizable faces, and disappear.  Ewan McGregor, a fine actor, makes the most of the limitations inherent in his role by giving a panicked performance worthy of a trapped Hitchcock hero.Director Marc Foster gave us the brilliant Monster's Ball, where character and stunning imagery propelled every frame.  His Finding Neverland had appeal, but certainly did not occupy the same rarified atmosphere.  In Stay, something very, very different is going on.  Character does not drive action, action, or lack thereof, drives character.Beautiful to watch, fairly interesting gizmo providing the big reveal, the ""aha moment.""

We have no context for this accident and while we see a main character walk off unharmed and later show up in a psychiatrist office -- we have no idea what's happening. Watching this film is like being in a dream where the scenes change from one place to another and they hold together in a weird sort of way but when you stop and think about it, it doesn't make sense.There's very little one can say about the plot without spoiling the film for the first time viewer. The scene to scene fades are fabulous, many of the scenes are visually stunning in the set up and beauty. The plot which is basically a psychiatrist treating a patient for a peer while she's on sick leave and the patient claiming he'll commit suicide is simple because as you move on nothing is as simple as that. You keep coming up with context that works for a while and then falls apart as the movie continues to be replaced with another supposition about what's happening.I happen to love these movies where I'm thrown into the deep end not knowing what's going on and having to make my own reality out of it. Others hate this kind of film. For me, who likes to question what I'm watching seeing this on DVD is great because I can talk while the film is running and back it up if I miss dialogue. It's a film that really gets you wondering about the line between life and death and just how much it can blur.

In I felt disgusted and decided to write-off the movie as eccentric although I like the art direction and cinematography.After viewing the second time, I could understand the movie and realized  the beauty behind it. Yes ! The movie is best appeciated only when it is rented !The movie begins with Ryan Gosling as Henry, a 21 yr old art student, surviving an accident in New York city. He contacts Psychiatrist Sam (played by Ewan Mcgregor) who is actually filling in for another psychiatrist on vacation. Henry tell Sam that he is hallucinating and hearing voices and in fact predicts things. Henry tells Sam that he is going to commit suicide in 3 days. Sam tries to help the young man by following him, trying to inform his parents but finds himself caught between reality and imagination with bizarre brief delusions.He finds most of the moments are repeating. During this stage, Sam is preparing to marry his girlfriend Lila (played by Naomi watts) whom he saved from her suicide attempt when she was his patient. Although her role is limited, her significance comes into light at the end of the movie. We learn Henry is dating an actress Athena (Elizabeth Reaser). Sam visits her too.The movie revolves mostly around Sam and his frantic attempts to save Henry. The movie is visually stunning with great costumes, with corridors and stairways full of twins and triplets.Cinematography is very stylish. We see elements out of focus suddenly coming in to focus in the next scene. The door opening to aquarium and aquarium leading to Sam's apartment. Manhattan appears to be  painted with blue/green walls in matrix era, giving breathtaking scenery. Great Art direction featuring architectural beauty. Lot of motifs. We get this only in second viewing of the film.The spoiler ! - The film is mostly about Sam trying to know Henry to save him in 3 days. We discover that most of the movie is a dream in Henry head before he dies in the car accident.We see Henry is driving in a car along with his girlfriend and parents. The car meets accident and everyone except Henry die in the accident. He is consumed with Guilt(Motif - 'Forgive me' written all over wall in his apartment) for being responsible for parents and girlfriend's death. Before dying, he dreams of giving the wedding ring to Naomi and asks her to marry. Chilling near-death experience show in stylish and artistic fashion.However the movie confuses the audience on several occasions with . I bet many people would be bewildered after the movie.

969763,AORW1FRF4D4KS,B000E6ESL2,azindn,"[4, 7]","If you like your films to unfold in a didactic and chronological order with a happy ending wrapped up with a bow, this is not the film for you. In fact, if obtuse and disjointed films are your preference, this film is not going to fall within those parameters either. Stay is an indie film that verges on a David Lynch approach to film making, ultimately becoming digital artwork with the presentation of life flashing before death as a myth of a distracted and dreamlike intense physical experience. The film leaves a hoard of clues through direction and symbolism that also if missed, will intensify the building sense of lost perspective.Beginning with a car crash and ending with the same car crash, the characters of Dr. Sam Foster (Ewan McGregor) and Henry (Ryan Gosling) are intertwined in a dance of changing perspectives, identities, and time. The secondary story lines of Sam and his girlfriend, Lila (Naomi Watt) a failed suicide and art teacher, Sam's blind mentor (Bob Hoskins), and a second colleague and failed doctor (Janeen Garafalo) as well as the search for Athena, all build to create divergent perspectives ultimately which will madden or intrigue audiences. If one can simply watch and enjoy the screen, the story is obvious and a visual treat.Wanting to grasp the story's threads that keep unraveling, there is almost an abstract digital art look to most of the photography used in the film especially the visual compositions where each scene seems able to be framed and hung on a art gallery wall. Additionally, the disjointed edits become transformed to visual movement, and sensitive lighting envelope the actors in an ethereal glow, especially Ms. Watt. The visual strength of the film is how it conveys the transitional moment of physical death as recollection and floating time, two points that intrigue with their disturbing and sensuous ""look."" The dislocated sense of time seems to function moving the storyline through several points of action that create visual clues to the meaning always just under the surface. The notion that the film is grounded in a more surrealist take on the death experience unfold with obvious points in the story as actors switch back and forth in their lines, physicality, and more than once, in placement before the camera lens. The European look or flavour of this film is visualized by stunning camera work often behind the actor or observed in the perspective, angles, and location of settings which will surprise audiences accustomed to seeing New York city as the typical vertical big city setting for every film.  Stay is unsettling film but filled with marvelous individual performances which are opportunities to enjoy the superb cast in one on one scenes. But as a total film, this dreamlike flow, simply melts into a follow the dots puzzle that will eventually connect.The DVD commentary by director Foster with lead actor Ryan Gosling give some actor insight to the movie, but it needs more.  Although a second set of comments by the director, his DP and other tech is somewhat more informative, it becomes more an annoyance as the director puts a damper to some discussions raised to avoid giving away the film's secrets.  After several viewings the tricks of the camera also melt too much into neat bows that make it an artful package but somewhat unsatisfying story.  Although the film's meaning is problematic, Foster wants the audience to interpret for themselves without his having to explain it all.

I was actually laying on the couch, but that's beside the point.  The mystery of the storyline is constantly shifting around, and I kept wondering where certain plot twists were going.  To me, that's a sign of a very good, creative storyline.This is the kind of movie that makes you think while you're watching it, as you sit there thinking to yourself where certain plot twists are leading to.  The amount of creativity this movie featured is out of this world.  I can't believe people are actually giving it bad reviews.  Stay was overall a very good movie.  You just have to pay attention to what's going on.This movie actually reminded me of another film where a bunch of people were out in a small western town, and one of them was the killer.  Both movies had a really good twist at the very end that tied the storyline together nicely and completely unexpectedly.To be honest, I didn't entirely understand the ending.  I was left feeling like I didn't quite understand a couple minor things.  Maybe watching it again will help me figure those things out.  It doesn't matter though, because the fact that Stay offered so much makes the film entirely memorable.  In fact, I'm GLAD I couldn't figure it out entirely on first viewing.  That means the second time will be even better.Whatever this movie is (a suspense, drama, or thriller) I give it the best possible grade available- 5 stars, and it's absolutely ridiculous to give this movie anything lower than 4 stars.",5,"wow, a wonderful movie",1162598400,"11 4, 2006",2006,1567,"['really', 'loved', 'movie', 'was', 'edge', 'seat', 'entire', 'time', 'Okay', 'not', 'really', 'was', 'actually', 'laying', 'couch', 'beside', 'point', 'mystery', 'storyline', 'constantly', 'shifting', 'around', 'kept', 'wondering', 'where', 'certain', 'plot', 'twists', 'were', 'going', 'sign', 'very', 'good', 'creative', 'storyline.This', 'kind', 'movie', 'think', ""'re"", 'watching', 'sit', 'there', 'thinking', 'yourself', 'where', 'certain', 'plot', 'twists', 'are', 'leading', 'amount', 'creativity', 'movie', 'featured', 'world', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'people', 'are', 'actually', 'giving', 'bad', 'reviews', 'Stay', 'was', 'overall', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'just', 'have', 'pay', 'attention', 'what', 'going', 'on.This', 'movie', 'actually', 'reminded', 'film', 'where', 'bunch', 'people', 'were', 'out', 'small', 'western', 'town', 'one', 'was', 'killer', 'movies', 'had', 'really', 'good', 'twist', 'very', 'end', 'tied', 'storyline', 'together', 'nicely', 'completely', 'unexpectedly.To', 'be', 'honest', 'did', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'understand', 'ending', 'was', 'left', 'feeling', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'understand', 'couple', 'minor', 'things', 'Maybe', 'watching', 'again', 'will', 'help', 'figure', 'things', 'out', ""n't"", 'matter', 'though', 'fact', 'Stay', 'offered', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'entirely', 'memorable', 'fact', ""'m"", 'GLAD', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'entirely', 'first', 'viewing', 'second', 'time', 'will', 'be', 'even', 'better.Whatever', 'movie', 'suspense', 'drama', 'thriller', 'give', 'best', 'possible', 'grade', 'available-', '5', 'stars', 'absolutely', 'ridiculous', 'give', 'movie', 'anything', 'lower', '4', 'stars']",N/A

Nothing upbeat about this film -- reminded me of 'The Hours' and the way a depressed person has the most trouble getting through all of the hours of a day.  In this convoluted story, it was hard somtimes to tell when the world was an illusion (the dream sequences) or if it was actually taking place at all.I fell in love with Dr. Sam Foster; I have never noticed before that Ewan McGregor has Bill Ross' mouth.  I have not had the opportunity to see Bill in at least 25 years, but when I saw his mouth, it brought back his 'Indian heritage' good looks and the way he smiled.  Henry, the troubled artist, looked like a grown-up Eric.  I thought all along that he was real, not a ghost, but he acted just like Zach did after Charlotte's betrayal and he attended Belmont College as an introspective loner.  Ryan Gosling was or could be Zach's double.  He was delightful in his inferiority complex and anguish of losing out on life.  He proposed to a waitress and then to the nurse at the scene of the accident.  It hurts to be so alone.Bob Hoskins was good as Leon, blind and not blind.  At first, I thought he was Ed Asner.  ""Sometimes we don't want to remember what the truth is.""  But, in this weaving in and out of dreams and ghosts still 'stay'ing around for Henry's benefit, it was sometimes impossible to know what the truth from fantasy. Was Lila one of Dr. Foster's patients or a nurse?  Her fortune cookie said: 'trouble will cease and fortune will smile upon you.'  A few years back, I had one which said: 'your talent will be recognized and suitably rewarded.'Since the centenniel of the Brooklyn Bridge, I've always wanted to see it close up.  Now, while viewing this intrigue underneath the bridge, my wish has been fulfilled.  Dr. Foster rode the subway to the Brooklyn Bridge to save Henry.  But suicide brought on by guilt (your tire blew out) is a big problem, and he was too late.  ""I was wrong.  Look around you.""  The hail storm was a good touch as was the thought that 'Tristan started a different tradition -- he died.""Dr. Foster continually wore pants which were too short. Psychiatrists don't dress like eccentric college professors.  At his office on the campus, he looked like Zach with his Roman nose.  He tried to get across to his patients that there is ""too much beauty to quit.""  The recreation of the accident at the end was self-explanatory.  I always thought that ghosts stayed around because they had been involved in mysterious deaths, not those involved in car wrecks.  Michael Feinstein has a heartrending recording of the song, 'Stay,' which interested me in this movie by the same title.  Listen to it and see if it affects you the same way.

As others have said, it is not a horror movie like many of us expected, it is more of a psychological thriller with supernatural surrealism mixed in. If that description seems confusing to you, so will the movie. Some reviewers have pointed out this was an attempt to copy a David Lynch type movie, this one does not rise to that standard, but it is a good movie nonetheless.The kid who plays Henry gives a really good performance.

969771,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,B000E6ESL2,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[9, 12]","By the time I finished watching ""Stay"" I was actually a little angry. I felt as though I just beaten my head against a wall trying to figure the film out, only to have them answer none of my questions. The plot, from what I could make out, involves Sam (Ewan McGregor) a psychologist trying to prevent one of his students (Ryan Gosling) from killing himself. After that it's all a mess to me. Marc Forster seems to be very impressed with himself that he can stump the audience, but it's no real trick when you hold all of the cards. And as a fan of his last two films (""Monster's Ball"" and ""Finding Neverland"") I was disappointed in him here. Perhaps his workmanlike nature (four films in five years) is starting to catch up with him. One thing is for sure though, he likes his films morbid.The basic idea seems to be that Sam believes Henry, his student, is going to kill himself because his favorite artist did it back in the day and he now views suicide as performance art. So he chases him through the city, checks up on said artist, and chitchats with his former female obsession. Along the way, of course, he goes nuts. After watching this and ""Close Your Eyes"" I do wonder why anybody would go into psychology as apparently they all end up crazier than their patients. I also have to point out that if everything is performance art (which it probably is) then isn't Sam's crusade to save Henry also a show? You know, ""Hey aren't I exciting and interesting I'm gonna save a life!"" For a more thoughtful look at this idea check out the documentary ""How to Draw a Bunny"" about a man who really did kill himself as a piece of performance art. But I cannot point out enough how nonsensical this film is. Forster uses every trick he can think of to create a narcotic, though at times beautiful, feel. People are dead, then alive. Blind, then not. Everybody knows everything about everybody, but no explanation is given. For all I know Henry never existed. Or was dead. Or was the alter ego of Sam.Ryan Gosling delivers the only worthwhile performance in the film. I do, however, wish he would break out of his comfort zone and play something other than a troubled youth. Naomi Watts doesn't seem to care and I really don't blame her. McGregor gets the award for worst acting here. He seems inserted from another film, and I think he was going for detached but came back with lost. I would probably say that he was miscast, though not as miscast as though yellow pants of his. I also had a personal interest in the ""bookstore"" near the end. It is actually a New York Public Library that I walk by everyday on my way to work. The set design team didn't seem very interested in making it not look like a library, but who really cares. What I do care about is the fact that this film had no regard for their audience. Granted, the psychological thriller genre is not my specialty, but I've certainly seen it done better than this. **1/4",2,Good Luck With This One,1160265600,"10 8, 2006",2006,2933,"['time', 'finished', 'watching', 'Stay', 'was', 'actually', 'little', 'angry', 'felt', 'just', 'beaten', 'head', 'wall', 'trying', 'figure', 'film', 'out', 'only', 'have', 'answer', 'none', 'questions', 'plot', 'what', 'could', 'make', 'out', 'Sam', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'psychologist', 'trying', 'prevent', 'one', 'students', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'killing', 'mess', 'Marc', 'Forster', 'be', 'very', 'impressed', 'can', 'stump', 'audience', 'real', 'trick', 'when', 'hold', 'cards', 'fan', 'last', 'two', 'films', 'Monster', 'Ball', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'was', 'disappointed', 'here', 'Perhaps', 'workmanlike', 'nature', 'four', 'films', 'five', 'years', 'starting', 'catch', 'up', 'One', 'thing', 'sure', 'films', 'morbid.The', 'basic', 'idea', 'be', 'Sam', 'Henry', 'student', 'going', 'kill', 'favorite', 'artist', 'did', 'back', 'day', 'now', 'suicide', 'performance', 'art', 'city', 'up', 'said', 'artist', 'chitchats', 'former', 'female', 'obsession', 'way', 'course', 'nuts', 'watching', 'Close', 'Eyes', 'do', 'wonder', 'why', 'anybody', 'would', 'go', 'psychology', 'apparently', 'end', 'up', 'crazier', 'patients', 'also', 'have', 'point', 'out', 'everything', 'performance', 'art', 'probably', 'then', ""n't"", 'Sam', 'crusade', 'save', 'Henry', 'also', 'show', 'know', 'Hey', 'are', ""n't"", 'exciting', 'interesting', ""'m"", 'gon', 'save', 'life', 'more', 'thoughtful', 'look', 'idea', 'check', 'documentary', 'How', 'Draw', 'Bunny', 'man', 'who', 'really', 'did', 'kill', 'piece', 'performance', 'art', 'can', 'not', 'point', 'out', 'enough', 'how', 'nonsensical', 'film', 'Forster', 'trick', 'can', 'think', 'create', 'narcotic', 'though', 'times', 'beautiful', 'feel', 'People', 'are', 'dead', 'then', 'alive', 'Blind', 'then', 'not', 'Everybody', 'everything', 'everybody', 'explanation', 'given', 'know', 'Henry', 'never', 'existed', 'was', 'dead', 'was', 'alter', 'ego', 'Sam.Ryan', 'Gosling', 'only', 'worthwhile', 'performance', 'film', 'do', 'however', 'wish', 'would', 'break', 'comfort', 'zone', 'play', 'something', 'other', 'troubled', 'youth', 'Naomi', 'Watts', ""n't"", 'seem', 'care', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'McGregor', 'award', 'worst', 'acting', 'here', 'inserted', 'film', 'think', 'was', 'going', 'detached', 'came', 'back', 'lost', 'would', 'probably', 'say', 'was', 'miscast', 'though', 'not', 'as', 'miscast', 'yellow', 'pants', 'also', 'had', 'personal', 'interest', 'bookstore', 'end', 'actually', 'New', 'York', 'Public', 'Library', 'walk', 'everyday', 'way', 'work', 'set', 'design', 'team', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'very', 'interested', 'making', 'not', 'look', 'library', 'who', 'really', 'What', 'do', 'care', 'fact', 'film', 'had', 'regard', 'audience', 'Granted', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'genre', 'not', 'specialty', ""'ve"", 'certainly', 'seen', 'done', 'better', '**1/4']",N/A

He sure knows how to pick em...and he sure knows how to bring em home.  I was floored with his performance in last years 'the notebook' and in 'murder by numbers' a few years back, but I felt that he went beyond that here.  He really is a talent of an actor.  That aside, this movie was decent, but I would have liked to feel a little more come from it.  It left me a little bored at times, giving me this 'I know I've seen this before' type feeling.  The plot is pretty standard.  You have your shrink (McGregor) and you have your patient (Gosling) and throughout the movie the shrink is trying to figure out whats wrong with the patient.  The ending, twist as it may be, is very generic and actually will have you disbelieving itself.  Lets just say that the climax revolves around your patient but the entire movie revolves around your shrink and so it almost makes NO sense that your main charactor is Ewan McGregor and that leads to my main complaint.  With the ending that was given the script could have focused more on Goslings charactor, following him around instead of McGregor which to me would have made for a more interesting ride.

Wow.Then comes the inevitable question in the viewer's mind : What is the movie about ? At first, we are prone to believe that the topic of STAY will be to show us how Sam Foster will manage to convince his patient Henry Letham to give up his intention to commit suicide. But soon, other options suggested by the director strike us. Thus, the movie could also be a sci-fi film about a psychic guy able to predict future events. Or is it rather a dream ? Numerous references to the Greek mythology, Freud or the Buddhist mystique seem point to this direction. If not, why does the director insist on showing us so many stairs in STAY ? It is evident then, the word stairs and the second part of the psychiatrist's name Fo-STER creating the kind of association we could find in a dream, that STAY is Henry Letham's dream.

969781,A29VKODW4R5U7W,B000E6ESL2,dooby,"[111, 122]","Stay is an interesting film. Unfortunately it suffered from very poor and misleading marketing and ended up attracting the wrong audience. True to form, it received many poor reviews from infuriated viewers who were expecting something totally different. It is NOT a horror movie or a movie about the supernatural. Neither is it a thriller as such. Nonetheless it is interesting and well made. As a previous reviewer said, it may appeal to fans of the original ""Twilight Zone"". As another reviewer more acerbically put it, it will appeal most to the ""Artsy-Fartsy"" type. The film is deliberately confusing, requires concentration and would definitely benefit from a rewatching, if it hasn't totally turned off the viewer by the end.The following paragraphs contain spoilers so don't read further if you want to see the movie with a fresh mindset. Just bear the above in mind.The movie begins with a car crash which we are told nothing about. We are then shown the person from the car crash (Ryan Gosling) seeing a psychiarist (Ewan McGregor). We are not told if this is the future or the past. What follows is surreal, like a dream. The director in his accompanying commentary tells us how he wanted the film to have a ""stream of consciousness"" feel to it. So, disconnected scenes melt into each other seamlessly in typical dreamlike fashion. The man tells the psychiatrist he will kill himself in 3 days. The psychiatrist then goes on a wild hunt to find out more about his patient. We know from the start that something is not right with the narrative. Clues abound that the narrative is not real. There are also indications that the psychiatrist and his patient are one person. From about a third of the way through the movie, I came under the suspicion that this was all in the psychiatrist's mind. In a way I wish it had gone that route which had more interesting possibilities but the ending chosen was also quite acceptable. The film could easily go down several paths with valid and enjoyable solutions. The ending here puts it all down to a deathbed hallucination on the part of the man in the car crash, a la ""Jacob's Ladder"", with most of the characters in the movie simply the people who came to pull him out of the car wreck. It is a sad story because as we learn, he was about to propose to his girlfriend who together with his parents, die in the wreck with him. I loved the final dream sequence where he watches his fiancee waltzing in a ballroom while he stands alone outside in the rain. Inadvertently, her partner turns and walks away, leaving her all alone. Its significance comes only on rewatching the film. By the way, for those who were thoroughly confused or did not stay to the end, his fiancee is the girl Athena that the psychiatrist is frantically looking for and she is also the brunette with the child (presumably the son he will never have) that recurs throughout the film. He, Henry, is a college student and artist so naturally his hallucinations include him gaining fame as an artist because he died so ""tragically young"". The psychiatrist and his artist wife (Naomi Watts) are the doctor and nurse (unrelated) who attend to him at the accident. And the various voices that he hears throughout the film are the voices of the onlookers.One sequence that was off-base for me was at the end where after the accident, Ewan McGregor's doctor is asking the nurse (Naomi Watts) out for a drink, when there is a flashback to them as husband and wife in Henry's hallucination. As Henry is already dead, the hallucinatory flashback is out of kilter with the logic of the film. Personally I thought it should have been excised. It felt too much like forcing onto the audience a happy ending - ""and they lived happily ever after..."" But alas, this is Hollywood.DVD is probably the best way to experience this movie. With its dismal performance at the box office, let's hope it gets a second chance here. Fox has released this in a fine 2.35:1 transfer (Anamorphic) with well-rendered colors and excellent black levels. The 2.35:1 transfer is strangely put on the flipside of a double-sided disc with the ""A"" side holding a ""Panned and Scanned"" version. The Dolby 5.1 track sounds equally fine. There are two sets of scene-specific commentaries by director, cast and crew as opposed to a full-length commentary. There is also a 6 minute featurette ""Departing Visions"" about people who have had near death experiences. There is however no trailer. Neither is there the ""Music of Stay"" featurette that is mentioned on Amazon's website.Definitely worth watching. You might not want to splurge on the cost of buying it but it certainly deserves at least a rental.",4,Interesting but confusing film...

969785,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000E6ESL2,Grady Harp,"[2, 2]","STAY  is a strange bird of a movie, one that you must be rested and in the mood for to watch, and one that asks that you forget the usual linear storyline and stay alert every minute.  Directed by Marc Forster (Monster Ball, Finding Neverland, and the upcoming The Kite Runner) and based on a story and screenplay by David Benioff (Troy, The 25th Hour, and the upcoming The Kite Runner!), STAY is more a mind-bending visual excursion that explores some dark psychological questions dealing with life, death, suicide, occult, and a m&eacute;lange of all of these.The opening of the film is a twisted visual experience that has to do with a car crashing on a bridge, fire, and a body - all given during the opening credits.  We then meet psychiatrist Dr. Sam Foster (Ewan McGregor) as he encounters a college student patient Henry Lethem (Ryan Gosling) whom he is seeing for his colleague, the emotionally exhausted Dr. Beth Levy (Janeane Garofalo).  Hesitant to work with a 'substitute psychiatrist' Henry eventually tells Sam he is planning to commit suicide that Saturday at midnight, a re-enactment of his painter idol's absurd life.  Sam's artist girlfriend Lila (Naomi Watts) was herself a suicide attempt rescued by Sam and offers her help in dealing with Sam's patient.  Sam also gleans advice from his mentor, the blind Dr Patterson (Bob Hoskins) and after numerous attempts to contact his associate Beth for information, Sam strikes out on his own in an attempt to understand Henry before he destroys himself.  He looks up Henry's mother (Kate Burton) whom Henry says is dead, discovers when Henry meets Dr Patterson that Henry claims Patterson is his father and is also dead. Ultimately Sam engages the services of a mental institution run by Dr Ren (BD Wong) and gains the promise that the institution will put a hold on Henry so that he will be unable to commit suicide.In the midst of this race Sam's world begins to crumble, people don't make sense, stories clash, and Sam tumbles around in a state closely resembling madness until the final frames when the entire situation of the film is made clear.  Nothing is as it appears when dealing with the thread that separates life and death.  The script is clumsy, the camera work is distractingly of kilter, little gimmicks are used to the extreme, and the tiny roles of supporting characters hardly merit the gifted actors such as Hoskins, Burton, and Garofalo.  Ryan Gosling is again tossed into a role that is starchy and unidimensional and despite his fine work his character remains aloof.  McGregor and Watts do the best they can with the script but end up becoming tropes wandering in from other similar stories.So why give the film 4 stars?  Because despite all the defects it does engage the mind and forces the viewer to set aside the general principles of understanding and just release the mind to a crazy ride. That is healthy film making and deserves attention.

969786,A1E8RJN1L9UMHX,B000E6ESL2,IKCWMBFD,"[2, 4]","Since a lot has been written here on this film already, I'll keep this pretty short.  This is a mindgame puzzle film, in that what is ""real"" may or may not be ""real,"" and your tolerance for this genre is key to whether you will enjoy the experience.  Stay is not a supernatural horror film or a suspense thriller as the marketing department was trying to sell it, really, though various moments or scenes throughout share elements with those genres.  One real reason to see it (and maybe more than once) is that it is a fascinating compendium of visual trickery and gimmicky edits, many utilizing CG.  It is sort of the running filmic equivalent of an M.C. Escher creation and probably whether you think Escher visual paradoxes are particuarly meaningful about reality will predict whether you think this is really truly deep or just formally clever and fun (count me in the latter).  Some people have claimed to find the film moving but frankly I just didn't.  To me, all the narrative playing around was way too slickly done and polished for me to invest in this or any of the characters emotionally and things felt too manipulated and contrived for the ending to really get to me.  And many of the narrative decisions seemed ultimately rather arbitrary and not entirely earned when the ending ""truth"" revelation finally rolled around.  I wouldn't really compare this to David Lynch as others have done; when Lynch is playing narrative games with you, it is meant to access the schizophrenic nature of the darker side of the human soul and the filmic structure creates a feeling of paranoia and unease.  Stay is not really going there; as mindgame movies go, this is more akin to Vanilla Sky in feel and aim: trying hard to be ""art"" but weirdly undermining itself through its oversized budget and overdeployed special effects, trying hard to say something serious about life but getting sort of lost in a bit of a new agey spiritual fog. So, a nice effort and pretty interesting to watch but not really resulting in a great film. Still, all that said, you could do much worse in your choice of how to spend an evening, and there is always the fabulous Naomi Watts to watch, though she is sadly underutilized in this vehicle.(One final P.S. to any filmmakers out there: please don't ever film a scene in a public library and claim it is taking place in a bookstore.)",3,a mixed bag of mixed nuts,1169337600,"01 21, 2007",2007,2367,"['lot', 'been', 'written', 'here', 'film', 'already', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'pretty', 'short', 'mindgame', 'puzzle', 'film', 'what', 'real', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'real', 'tolerance', 'genre', 'key', 'will', 'enjoy', 'experience', 'Stay', 'not', 'supernatural', 'horror', 'film', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'marketing', 'department', 'was', 'trying', 'sell', 'really', 'various', 'moments', 'scenes', 'share', 'elements', 'genres', 'One', 'real', 'reason', 'see', 'maybe', 'more', 'once', 'fascinating', 'compendium', 'visual', 'trickery', 'gimmicky', 'edits', 'many', 'utilizing', 'CG', 'sort', 'running', 'filmic', 'equivalent', 'M.C', 'Escher', 'creation', 'probably', 'think', 'Escher', 'visual', 'paradoxes', 'are', 'particuarly', 'meaningful', 'reality', 'will', 'predict', 'think', 'really', 'truly', 'deep', 'just', 'formally', 'clever', 'fun', 'count', 'latter', 'people', 'have', 'claimed', 'find', 'film', 'moving', 'frankly', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'narrative', 'playing', 'around', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'slickly', 'done', 'polished', 'invest', 'characters', 'emotionally', 'things', 'felt', 'too', 'manipulated', 'contrived', 'ending', 'really', 'get', 'many', 'narrative', 'decisions', 'seemed', 'ultimately', 'rather', 'arbitrary', 'not', 'entirely', 'earned', 'when', 'ending', 'truth', 'revelation', 'finally', 'rolled', 'would', ""n't"", 'really', 'compare', 'David', 'Lynch', 'others', 'have', 'done', 'when', 'Lynch', 'playing', 'narrative', 'games', 'meant', 'access', 'schizophrenic', 'nature', 'darker', 'side', 'human', 'soul', 'filmic', 'structure', 'feeling', 'paranoia', 'unease', 'Stay', 'not', 'really', 'going', 'there', 'mindgame', 'movies', 'go', 'more', 'akin', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'feel', 'aim', 'trying', 'hard', 'be', 'art', 'weirdly', 'undermining', 'oversized', 'budget', 'overdeployed', 'special', 'effects', 'trying', 'hard', 'say', 'something', 'serious', 'life', 'getting', 'sort', 'lost', 'bit', 'new', 'agey', 'spiritual', 'fog', 'So', 'nice', 'effort', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'watch', 'not', 'really', 'resulting', 'great', 'film', 'Still', 'said', 'could', 'do', 'much', 'worse', 'choice', 'how', 'spend', 'evening', 'always', 'fabulous', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'watch', 'sadly', 'underutilized', 'vehicle', 'One', 'final', 'P.S', 'filmmakers', 'out', 'there', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'film', 'scene', 'public', 'library', 'claim', 'taking', 'place', 'bookstore']",N/A

When Henry tells Sam about his suicidal plans to celebrate his 21st birthday in three days, Sam's attempts to save Henry lead to a mind-bending tale of regret, warped d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, and altered consciousness.Truly a visual masterpiece,Stayflows from one scene to another with creativity similar to interwoven scenes of a filmmaker's representation of an M.C. Escher painting.  Blending in a wave of colors and transitioning from one scene to another with some great jump cuts and interesting visual quirks, the cinematography is a surreal dream reminiscent of the originality and innovations in films likeThe Matrix,Sin City, andSpun.  Put it this way, in one red hue saturated, hallucinogenic bar scene, I would swear the filmmakers purposely cast Dr. Ruth and Salvador Dali look-alikes as bar patrons just to make the scene more bizarre.  Every scene is an excuse to use color, lighting, shapes, angles, and various editing techniques to accentuate the storyline and express the artistic aspect of filmmaking.  It's brilliant.If you enjoyed the story and twist from The Sixth Sense, then Director Marc Foster's journey, his hybrid version of reality and illusion, is sure to please.

969789,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B000E6ESL2,J from NY,"[7, 10]","Movies that require thought do not, as a rule, get very good responses in the United States.  Pretentious, artsy fartsy, a con, blah blah blah--these are the labels that unimaginative people or worse, imaginative people who hate being challenged on the wrong day, use to shove these films into a corner.  I sometimes picture them as sitting there with remote control in hand, cocked like a loaded gun, just waiting for some poor SOB with talent and a knack for visuals to make some pernicious masterpiece with the inexcusable motive of wanting to make them think.Most of the reviews of this movie here support my theory.""Stay"" is obviously Lynch inspired (even Ewan McGregor's hair in distinction to his business-like attire suggest an underhanded tribute to our favorite cinematic weirdo), but has a style all its own.  The presence of Naomi Watts as Lila, a manic-depressive painter who just happens to look like a supermodel and be on tons of medication (yes, folks, this is surreality indeed!) immediately recalls to mind herdoomed character in the sinister web of ""Mulholland Drive""; the difference between ""Stay"" and Lynch's masterpiece is that this ends on a note of hope rather than despair.  This has got to be the best performance Ryan Gosling has ever given, though I'm not sure that's saying a whole hell of a lot.He plays Henry Letham, a suicidal college student obsessed with art and his own culpability in a tragedy hinted at here and there in some disturbing flashbacks.  He is not just a vulnerable young man, however; at times we sense the possibility of real danger in his interactions with McGregor's Sam Foster.  Anyone who was frustrated by the plot and found the movie incomprehensible needs Ritalin or a pair of glasses: all one need do to understand what is really taking place is watch closely when the film shows a car wreck on the Brooklyn Bridge.  Incidentally, Henry is driving, Athena is next to him, and two older people who look very much like two other people we see in the film are in the back.  At the end of the film you see Sam Foster, actually a doctor and not a psychiatrist, shining a light in his badly wounded eyes and imploring him to ""Stay with us, Henry"", while Lila, realy a nurse, is right next to him.  The rest is the creation of Henry's tormented mind.  That is the key to the movie and you don't really need two viewings to understand it.While this is the kernel of the carnival of perceptions that happens around us, you could also interpret Henry's motives in a different way; perhaps he was really thinking of the fictional painter Tristan Reveur (""an elegant suicide is the perfect work of art"") when he crashed into the car in front of him, allowing it to happen without really understanding the consequences.  I only even consider this because it doesn't appear Henry was a happy guy in the first place and the movie is very chilling.At times this movie has unbelievable power.  When Sam goes to visit Henry's mother, everything is so effectively creepy that you can understand where this is classified as a horror film.Underneath all the madness and terror of Henry's limbo-like state of delusion is the dilemma of ""the final moment"": when we are on death's door, at risk of being killed, seriously injured, diagnosed with a terminal disease et al, sometimes we get the benefit of seeing intuitively how valuable life really is, whatever we may have thought before the danger strikes.  This is Henry's normal state of consciousness because he is indeed dying this entire time and has not had the courage to transcend his fears and ask Athena to marry him or clear the air with his parents.  This is why Sam Foster says, at the end, ""Henry, if this is a dream, the whole world's in it!""  We can only fully appreciate the vividness and beauty of things (hence Henry's interest in painting, his extraordinary talent) when we don't have them right in our grasp anymore.

How much of what I've experienced is real and how much can be attributed to the workings of my lunatic mind. ""The Machinist"" and ""Stay"", films with very dissimilar plots, share the same themes and stylistic conventions. In both, the viewer is asked to put his faith in a story that doesn't necessarily make sense in the rational world. I have an enormous fear of this type of picture--because often times, in the end, what doesn't make sense simply doesn't make sense. And what a let down, after having sat through a complex and narratively challenging film--to be left with nothing to show for it.Both films share the same deliberate pacing. Both were marketed in the realm of pshycological thriller--but, in truth, fall squarely in the drama category. Both films boast great performaces. In ""The Machinist"", Christian Bale, having lost a third of his body weight for this film, is exemplary. As a man who hasn't slept for a year, he is hauntingingly believable as he struggles to make sense of his surroundings and what is happening to him. In ""Stay"", we've got Ryan Gosling and Ewan McGregor as a psychiatrist and his patient. Both are terrific, as each is somehow displaced from the real world.Both films tip their hat early on that all is not as it seems. With deja vu, disjointed editing, overlapping plot points--you know you've entered into a puzzle, a pshychological mindgame. You either buy into the story or not and you try to understand what is real and what's in the mind. And all along, you hope for the payoff--that you will ultimately be rewarded for your intellectual effort.And here's where the films diverge...""The Machinist"" pays off. I let out a huge sigh of relief, empathized and understood the ending. The film by Brad Anderson (director of a great little thriller ""Session 9) is a rich and emotional journey--one well worth taking. ""Stay"", however, is another story. While the ending isn't difficult to comprehend--it is far too simplistic for all that has transpired previously. It's a big let down for someone hoping for something clever or original--the picture becomes a fantasy upon fantasy construct and a bit of a cheat.Neither film is perfect--but ""The Machinist"" is an intriguing film made by talented people. It's worthy of a 4 star rating. ""Stay"" is, ultimately, an exercise in futility--but I'd give it 2 stars for its performances.

969793,A2ICI500LRO01K,B000E6ESL2,Kyle Wells,"[2, 4]","The best thing that can be said of Marc Forster's ""Stay"" is that it is an interesting mess. The film is too often confused in purpose and downright heavy-handed in execution to ever be good, but it is not without some worthwhile visuals and intriguing plot points. Its originality is suspect to my observation, with comparisons to numerous other recent dark, psychological emo movies being unavoidable. ""Donnie Darko"" comes to mind, as does ""The Machinist,"" but for all their similarities (perception shifting revelation made at ending; stories shrouded by psychological state of main character) ""Stay"" has to be the gloomiest and most angst ridden of the bunch. The theme of suicide is certainly a factor in this, but rather then tackling this oft discussed subject with a certain amount of originality and perceptiveness, the film's dreary style often had me considering ending it all. The film that is.Confusion is the corner stone for films of this sort, and as a result I may need to reveal some plot points in this review to try and make some sense of the film as a whole, so consider this a spoiler warning. The film centres on Ryan Gosling who, revising his role from ""The United States of Leland,"" plays Henry Letham, a rather broody art student bent on ending his own life on the eve of his twenty-first birthday. Ewan McGregor is Sam Foster, a psychiatrist who is trying to help Henry and discover the cause of his depression. Naomi Watts is Sam's girlfriend and former patient, who has tried the suicide route before. This basic plot seems sturdy at first, but as the film progresses the continuity of the film's reality becomes more and more compromised as the concepts of time, place, and action begin to falter. By closing, all illusions of reality are revealed as the very fabric of the corporeal world begins to unwind. And then, as with the other films of this kind, all is revealed at the film's close. Sort of.The story is interesting enough and some of the acting and dialogue is intriguing, but the overall atmosphere of the film brings down the piece as a whole. I am admittedly a bit bored with the entire sub-genre of films with which ""Stay"" relates, but the angst-soaked pace and imagery of this film sinks the genre to a new depressive low. The film looks as though it has been directed by David Fincher on downers, utilizing CGI cuts and flashy editing, but in a manner that manages to further denigrate the content, rather than artificially support it. This style is implemented to call the `reality' of the film into question, and while the technique is occasionally effective (especially towards the end) and certainly full of potential, its presence in this film more often detracts than enhances. The actors are intermittently interesting, but more often dull. Gosling is about as exciting as your average sixteen year old Death Cab for Cutie fan (likely the target audience of the film), only twice as annoying. McGregor is as bland as he is in most of his American films, but did handle the role with a certain amount of professionalism that suited it, not to mention the most stylish hair a psychiatrist has ever dreamed of. Watts, who I quite like, was given a rather one-note character, but her highly expressive eyes and her usual strong screen presence were still quite noticeable.At the end of the film (spoiler!) we are told that everything previous has been nothing more than the dream of a dying man. Or has it? The film's final `revelation' is far from clear (if it was Henry's dream, the why did it centre on Sam?), but it at least seems interesting enough that you may actually care what it means. Which is something anyways. A certain amount of aesthetic experimentation makes ""Stay"" an often compelling film to look at, but its tone and utterly bleak style make it often nearly unbearable to actually watch. The film is at its best when using its compelling visuals to question the reliability of perception and the nature of reality, but unfortunately this theme gets tied up with a story so pedantic and overwrought that all life is sucked out of the piece. If I truly wanted to be a moody teenager once again I'd rather put on some headphones and listen to Nine Inch Nails and get to the heart of the matter.",3,Interesting Concept; Dreary Execution,1154217600,"07 30, 2006",2006,4260,"['best', 'thing', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Marc', 'Forster', 'Stay', 'interesting', 'mess', 'film', 'too', 'often', 'confused', 'purpose', 'downright', 'heavy-handed', 'execution', 'ever', 'be', 'good', 'not', 'worthwhile', 'visuals', 'intriguing', 'plot', 'points', 'originality', 'suspect', 'observation', 'comparisons', 'numerous', 'other', 'recent', 'dark', 'psychological', 'emo', 'movies', 'being', 'unavoidable', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'mind', 'Machinist', 'similarities', 'perception', 'shifting', 'revelation', 'made', 'ending', 'stories', 'shrouded', 'psychological', 'state', 'main', 'character', 'Stay', 'be', 'gloomiest', 'most', 'angst', 'ridden', 'bunch', 'theme', 'suicide', 'certainly', 'factor', 'rather', 'then', 'tackling', 'oft', 'discussed', 'subject', 'certain', 'amount', 'originality', 'perceptiveness', 'film', 'dreary', 'style', 'often', 'had', 'considering', 'ending', 'film', 'is.Confusion', 'corner', 'stone', 'films', 'sort', 'result', 'may', 'need', 'reveal', 'plot', 'points', 'review', 'try', 'make', 'sense', 'film', 'whole', 'so', 'consider', 'spoiler', 'warning', 'film', 'centres', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'who', 'revising', 'role', 'United', 'States', 'Leland', 'Henry', 'Letham', 'rather', 'broody', 'art', 'student', 'bent', 'ending', 'own', 'life', 'eve', 'twenty-first', 'birthday', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'Sam', 'Foster', 'psychiatrist', 'who', 'trying', 'help', 'Henry', 'discover', 'cause', 'depression', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'Sam', 'girlfriend', 'former', 'patient', 'who', 'tried', 'suicide', 'route', 'before', 'basic', 'plot', 'sturdy', 'first', 'film', 'continuity', 'film', 'reality', 'more', 'more', 'compromised', 'concepts', 'time', 'place', 'action', 'begin', 'falter', 'closing', 'illusions', 'reality', 'are', 'revealed', 'very', 'fabric', 'corporeal', 'world', 'unwind', 'then', 'other', 'films', 'kind', 'revealed', 'film', 'close', 'Sort', 'of.The', 'story', 'interesting', 'enough', 'acting', 'dialogue', 'intriguing', 'overall', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'down', 'piece', 'whole', 'am', 'admittedly', 'bit', 'bored', 'entire', 'sub-genre', 'films', 'Stay', 'angst-soaked', 'pace', 'imagery', 'film', 'genre', 'new', 'depressive', 'low', 'film', 'been', 'directed', 'David', 'Fincher', 'downers', 'utilizing', 'CGI', 'cuts', 'flashy', 'editing', 'manner', 'further', 'denigrate', 'content', 'rather', 'artificially', 'support', 'style', 'implemented', 'call', 'reality', 'film', 'question', 'technique', 'occasionally', 'effective', 'especially', 'end', 'certainly', 'full', 'potential', 'presence', 'film', 'more', 'often', 'enhances', 'actors', 'are', 'intermittently', 'interesting', 'more', 'often', 'dull', 'Gosling', 'as', 'exciting', 'average', 'sixteen', 'year', 'old', 'Death', 'Cab', 'Cutie', 'fan', 'likely', 'target', 'audience', 'film', 'only', 'twice', 'annoying', 'McGregor', 'as', 'bland', 'most', 'American', 'films', 'did', 'handle', 'role', 'certain', 'amount', 'professionalism', 'suited', 'not', 'mention', 'most', 'stylish', 'hair', 'psychiatrist', 'ever', 'dreamed', 'Watts', 'who', 'quite', 'was', 'given', 'rather', 'one-note', 'character', 'highly', 'expressive', 'eyes', 'usual', 'strong', 'screen', 'presence', 'were', 'still', 'quite', 'end', 'film', 'spoiler', 'are', 'told', 'everything', 'previous', 'been', 'nothing', 'more', 'dream', 'dying', 'man', 'film', 'final', 'revelation', 'far', 'clear', 'was', 'Henry', 'dream', 'why', 'did', 'centre', 'Sam', 'least', 'interesting', 'enough', 'may', 'actually', 'care', 'what', 'Which', 'something', 'anyways', 'certain', 'amount', 'aesthetic', 'experimentation', 'Stay', 'often', 'compelling', 'film', 'look', 'tone', 'utterly', 'bleak', 'style', 'make', 'often', 'nearly', 'unbearable', 'actually', 'watch', 'film', 'best', 'when', 'using', 'compelling', 'visuals', 'question', 'reliability', 'perception', 'nature', 'reality', 'unfortunately', 'theme', 'tied', 'up', 'story', 'so', 'pedantic', 'overwrought', 'life', 'sucked', 'piece', 'truly', 'wanted', 'be', 'moody', 'teenager', 'once', 'again', ""'d"", 'rather', 'put', 'headphones', 'listen', 'Nine', 'Inch', 'Nails', 'get', 'heart', 'matter']",N/A

969805,A4RQ549E9K6B4,B000E6ESL2,Michael S. Fleischer,"[8, 11]","Stay startles the senses, challenges reason, and stretches the imagination. Director Marc Forster's film opens with a nighttime glimpse of a passenger car, smiling faces, and an engagement ring. Just as you piece together the happy event, it is obliterated by a horrendous automobile accident on the Brooklyn Bridge. In a flurry, the camera pans your view away from the dimly lit, rain soaked carnage to a young man standing, incomprehensively, over the wreckage.Henry Letham (Ryan Gosling, in a genuinely riveting performance) is a college student and aspiring artist. He is the tragedy's sole survivor. Devastated, you sense his guilt and disappointment. Poised at the cusp of adulthood, Henry threatens to take his life in three days, at midnight, on his 21st birthday, just like one of his role models from a previous age. Seeking help from his therapist, Dr. Beth Levy (Janeane Garafolo, her usual quirky and effecive self), he finds Dr. Sam Foster (Ewan McGregor, plucky and intelligent), in her stead. Sam's concern and curiosity over Henry's suicidal predilections and uncanny ability to predict unusual weather phenomena incites him to investigate the young man's background and relationships. His inquiry intensifies into an obsession, which troubles Sam's live-in girlfriend, Lila Culpepper (Naomi Watts, handling yet another complex role expertly). She bears the brunt of his deteriorating mental condition. Lila, like Henry, is an artist, but also an art professor. Before becoming his lover, Lila was Sam's patient. In her darkest hour, when she thought she hated life so much that she included a backup razor to slit her wrists, Lila found enough beauty in the world to stay her hand.At this point in the film, you may be wondering, ""What is it with writer David Benieoff and these characters?""Many have interpreted Sam and Lila as refracted images of Henry's conglomerate personality, composites of his masculine and feminine self, desperately working together to save his life. After all, there was the time Lila called Sam, ""Henry,"" to Sam's dismay! However, reality in Stay is prismatic--lucid in its elements, and fleeting and dissonant in its construction.  Scenes morph deciduously into each other like the discordant brushstrokes of the impressionist artwork that is poignantly portrayed. Stay assuredly opens itself to subjective interpretation--especially over its sublime aspects.There is much to recommend in this film. Fascinating incongruities and similarities in the characters' perceptions of each other distinguish it from other films in the genre. In one scene, for instance, Sam and Henry interact with the same sightless individual (Bob Hoskins, in studied excellence). Concomitantly, this person is Sam's colleague, Dr. Leon Patterson, but also Henry's father, Mr. Lethem, who Henry thinks he has murdered! In another scene, Sam and Henry confront each other in roiled fury, conversing in the same dialogue.As in some recent films, viewers are exposed to reinforced, emblematic images. We see, for instance, multiple sets of human twins (even triplets) and other ""doubles,"" including an aquarium showcasing paired walruses. Also noteworthy is the geometric precision in featured architecture. A spiral staircase figures prominently in one scene. Reminiscent of the RNA helix, it is the place where Sam loses pace with Henry's fianc&eacute;e, Athena (Elizabeth Reaser), whom he tracks to her college theater.Sam's provocative visit to Henry's Long Island home, yields an otherworldly encounter with his mother, Mrs. Lethem (Kate Burton, eerily stoic), and her distrustful dog, which does not leave Sam unscathed! All this, however, contradicts the tragic family history, recounted by a disbelieving Sheriff Kennelly (Michael Gaston). Another memorable scene finds Henry popping into one of New York City's sleazy peep shows, where he voyeuristically peers through a bevy of undulating, leggy pole-dancers onto a flickering flat panel that randomly shuffles through a montage of his life's photos.At the film's conclusion, we return to the controversial scene of Henry's automobile accident. Many characters re-appear as onlookers. The camera pans the wreckage and lingers briefly over the bodies, confirming a few suspicions. This time, Henry lies prone on the street, clearly dying. A nurse tends to him, helplessly. She is Lila Culpepper, who appears to Henry as the corporeal echo of Athena, his lost love. As his life fades, Lila can do no more for Henry than tearfully assent to his labored proposal of marriage. If Henry cannot ""stay,"" as Lila hopes, then something spiritual indeed has survived his mercurial trek between life and death. Ancient Hermetic and Egyptian adepts believed in Duat, the twilight netherworld journeyed by souls who, in life, travail to find gnosis, the knowledge needed to re-ascend heaven and achieve perfect Unity. Lila's promise of eternal love to Henry was his epiphany, the ultimate act of ""beauty"" in the world that willed Henry not to take his own life--even if he had to lose it. As the ancients knew it, love--not suicide, not self-sacrifice--was the promised path to salvation, the knowledge needed to free oneself from the lamentable cycle of corrupt material confinement. At the magical moment of Lila's consent, a recovered memory flashed across the mind of Dr. Sam Foster. It was a wondrous glimpse of a loving relationship, kindled in another dimension--some call it d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. Having replaced Beth Levy as a qualified responder at the accident scene, Sam found himself at the right place, at the right time, to impulsively ask a heartbroken nurse, a lovely stranger and compatriot ""guardian angel,"" to join him for a cup of coffee, to help pass an unbearable night. Miraculously, Lila Culpepper consented and they departed together, embarked toward a better destiny.",4,Spirit Matters,1150156800,"06 13, 2006",2006,5862,"['Stay', 'senses', 'challenges', 'reason',

As Sam begins to look into Henry's life, he finds the line between reality and illusion begin to blur.""Stay"" is all of that and none of that at the same time.  Things are not what they seem, and it is interesting to watch things unfold.  What could have been a huge twist at the end is instead diffused by scenes early on the let the audience in on what is happening.  In fact, it is possible to know what is going on from the very beginning of the film.

Seemingly inspired by his idol, a painter infamous for committing suicide on his 21st birthday, Henry tells Sam he will shoot himself Saturday at midnight - the moment he turns 21. Sam, having previously saved his suicidal girlfriend Lila (Watts), takes the threat seriously but fails to detain Henry so he can be taken into medical custody (a rather grim prospect). Instead, while trying to track his patient down, Sam learns more about Henry and is gradually drawn into his world - Henry's parents are dead (Henry insists it's all his fault.), his girlfriend is ""gone,"" he seems to know what's going to happen before it does, he's sure he's going to hell, he tells Sam it's ""too late"" to save him, etc. The more Sam learns about Henry, the more he begins to lose his own grip on reality. (But for those of you who hate ambiguity, don't fret. All is revealed in the final scenes of the film.)First of all, the film is beautifully shot. Henry is an art student, and the film itself has a very artistic vibe. Scenes bleed into one another in a beautiful but disorienting manner. Shots are jumped in interesting ways. The closing credits are even artistic. The film's tone is mostly a collection of blues and grays, lots of dark shots, some cool silhouettes.Secondly, the film does a good job of keeping the audience off-track. You're never quite sure what is happening. Is Henry mad? Is Sam going mad? Are Henry and Sam one in the same? What is reality and what is psychosis? Even at the close, when the film's endgame is revealed, your brain has to chew on it for a while to put all of the pieces together.OK, SPOILER ALERT. Don't read further if you don't want to know the ending.Here's what's really going on: Henry is never really Sam's patient at all. He's the victim of a car accident. He's been thrown from the vehicle (he was driving), and he's lying faceup on the Brooklyn Bridge. Sam is simply a bystander who witnessed the car accident (in which Henry's parents and girlfriend have died) and has stopped to help.The movie is really a study of the mind - what an injured brain is thinking as death nears. Henry is conscious of Sam and the onlookers (all who appear in previous incarnations in the film, in Henry's ""world""), and his racing mind is trying to reconcile things and make sense of them. Should he fight to try and live (with his family and girlfriend dead?), or should he succumb to death? He knows Sam is trying to help him, but is it really too late? Is the beauty of the world worth trying to stick around for? Suffering from a head wound and shock, how can Henry know what is real and what is only in his mind in those final moments, as time bends and distorts?I thought this was a BRILLIANT film. Highly original content treated in a totally engrossing, entertaining, beautiful manner. Performances were wonderful, and I was totally hooked.

Christenson / Lunamation ""SpaceComics.com""","[8, 9]","If you like movies with unexplainable events in an apparently ordinary, real-life situation, you'll probably like this one.  I mean psychological dramas like K-Pax and The Butterfly Effect, and certain ghost stories like A Stir Of Echoes and Dragonfly.  This one has ghosts (anachronistic apparitions), miracles, a pivotal car accident, extreme deja vu, and other mysterious happenings.It's ostensibly about a psychiatrist, Sam Foster (Ewan McGregor) investigating the background of a young patient, Henry Letham (Ryan Gosling) who threatened suicide.  While searching for Letham, who walked out of his office after the specific threat, Foster visits Letham's mother, a waitress he liked, and others.  Foster himself experiences repeated and increasing deja vu and other illusions and unexplainable events while tracking down and confronting his patient.  For instance, Letham claimed his parents were dead; when Foster sees Letham's mother, he thinks she's real, but to the audience it's like a vision of her spirit.  These mysteries add up gradually, keeping the film intensely interesting.  The main question is whether  you will be disappointed by the end.  I was not.  In the next paragraph I'll tell you about it - it will spoil it for you if you haven't seen the movie yet, so don't read it.To me, the end explained everything.  To some, it might seem a cop out.

969814,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B000E6ESL2,RMurray847,"[1, 3]","STAY is the epitome of the old clich&eacute; ""all style and no substance.""  There is a lot of serious camera trickery, wild editing, nifty camera movies and the like.  It's also got lots of moments that are clearly meant to be creepy, or at least heavy with foreshadowing...you just don't know what's being foreshadowed.  Directed by Marc Forster, who did both MONSTER'S BALL and FINDING NEVERLAND, STAY misses the mark when it comes to a STORY we can truly care about.  Forster has proven himself to be a fine director.  He also has probably done nearly as well as he could with this film...I suspect it's a movie that should not have been made in the first place.STAY is nominally in the same ilk as SIXTH SENSE, THE RING, etc.  Heck, it even features a psychiatrist working with a disturbed youth.  Lots of portentious things happen throughout, so you certainly get the sense that something weird is going on, and that you've got a puzzle to sort out.  I guess it's fun to try to put the pieces together before the movie does it for you.  Thinking back on it, I think it MIGHT be possible to figure out where the movie is going to twist in the end...but there are an awful lot of red herrings on the way too.The film starts as the story of a psychiatrist (EWAN MACGREGOR) who is assigned the case of a young man (RYAN GOSLING) who has stopped his car in the middle of the Brooklyn Bridge and set fire to it, and now is threatening to commit suicide by midnight on Saturday...just three days away.  The shrink believes the kid means it, but somehow he can't manage to get him committed, and can't even really keep track of him.  Gosling shows up on his time, not MacGregors, and they play a cat and mouse game, where MacGregor pries a few ""facts"" from Gosling, who then darts away.  Things get stranger when Bob Hoskins appears as MacGregor's mentor (and he also happens to be blind), because Gosling sees him and declares that this man is his dead father come back to life.So, as MacGregor digs deeper, he begins to experience strange things himself...perhaps even carrying on conversations with ghosts.  His artist girlfriend (an underused Naomi Watts) tries to offer support, but she becomes a bit obsessed with the idea of meeting and helping this kid herself, as she has in the past attempted suicide herself.Things become more and more confusing as we approach the time of the suicide.  And then all is revealed.  The ""twist"" ending is rather mundane and has been done numerous times before.  I won't spoil it by hinting at what it is, but my impression was that I had just spend 90 minutes waiting for a pretty disappointing climax.The movie never really makes us care very much for anyone in it.  MacGregor's character mostly comes across as a bit of a wimp (who can apparently cast aside all his other patients at the drop of a hat) and a terrible problem solver.  Watts is a moping cipher.  Janeanne Garafalo makes a brief appearance, and her character is one-note as well.  Gosling has the most to work with, but his character changes moods for no apparent reason, so it's difficult to work up much sympathy.  The whole puzzle of the film is academic...we don't invest emotion into it.Then there are the pants.  MacGregor's character wears high-waters throughout the film, for NO good reason.  If you watch the ending VERY carefully, you'll know why his character dresses this way, but it is NOT worth it for the filmmakers to have thrown this in the mix.  Every time we see Ewan, we see his short pants and it is HUGELY distracting.  ""WHY???"" you ask yourself over and over.  ""It makes no sense and it looks really stupid besides,"" you answer yourself.So, in summation, the film has a lot of style and cool trickery.  It lacks a heart, and unfortunately, the climax lacks real surprise or impact.  The final scenes do manage to develop just a bit of sadness...the first real emotion we feel.

This act of suicide is identical to the one which his idol artist commited himself as he turned twenty one. His psychiatrist, or actually 'fill in' psychiatrist, Sam Foster (Ewan McGregor) takes the threat very seriously, due to the fact that he saved his current girlfriend (Naomi Watts) from the same experience.As the days draw nearer and still Sam feels as though he has nothing to go on, his own grip on 'reality' begins to slip away as he delves deeper and deeper into Henry's twisted past and strange illusions of the mind.The 'skips' that occur in this movie, which are mere movement which seem to 'fast forward' between Henry's past and future, seem to almost melt Sam and Henry together. Who can forget the scene where Sam is chasing Henry and grabs him and they switch off saying ""I need some answers!""?Or the scene where they are both getting off two trains and Sam's face changes to Henry's? Overall, this movie is incredible.I give it four stars due to the fact that it requires some afterthoughts which take a long time to process, and we feel like we have lost some of the information we were gathering. it is hard in this movie to distinguish between reality and imagination, what is truth, what is a lie, what is there, and what isn't.

969825,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B000E6ESL2,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[2, 3]","""Stay"" is a strange movie with a feeling of dark unreality about it.  Occupying an unusual place in the crossroads of horror, drama, metaphysical and thriller territory, the most basic description of its plot would be that it's about a psychiatrist (played by Ewan McGregor) trying to prevent one of his patients (Ryan Gosling) from committing suicide, and finding out along the way that the patient may possess some kind of supernatural attributes.  But it gets a lot weirder, more baffling even, as it goes along.  The initial glimpes of possible paranormal powers - like an unerring ability to make predictions about the future - and hints that Gosling may have committed some kind of crime in his past, give way to more difficult-to-quantify phenomena, as MacGregor finds the whole world around him turning into an unfamiliar place in which the rules of time and space no longer seem to apply.  If this is one you were thinking of getting but have heard one of the spoiler reviews that give away the ending, I'd urge you not to forego it for that reason.  For one thing, there's a lot of little things in the undercurrent - including right toward the end - that imply the 'resolutions' may not be as cut-and-dried as they seem at first glance.

969826,AL277B4AQCWBG,B000E6ESL2,Steven Reynolds,"[12, 17]","Lovers of ""Stay"" accuse its critics of ""not understanding"" the movie, or of being so dumb that we need to be spoon-fed a Hollywood narrative. So let me start by saying I understand it. I know the story it's telling - Henry Letham is dying on the road after an accident, and what we're seeing is a scenario constructed by his dying brain as he struggles with the decision to hang on or to give in to guilt and let go. This isn't fully revealed until the film's final minutes, but it is at that point made abundantly clear. So I get it. It's a very old story, at least as old as Ambrose Bierce's nineteenth-century short story ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge"". The story's fine. The problem I have with ""Stay"" is that as a film it's insufferably tedious.Twist movies only work when everything before the twist has been internally consistent - films like ""The Usual Suspects"", ""Fight Club"" and ""The Sixth Sense"" (or anything else by Shyamalan, to date) work so well because you're entirely drawn in by what you think is the story only to find out, in the final act, that you've been told a very different one. This requires respect for the art of storytelling, something Marc Forster and David Benihoff seem to have forgotten. Rather than crafting a strong narrative that can be radically reinterpreted through an unexpected final revelation - as Bierce did, and as Adrian Lyne and Bruce Joel Rubin did in what is essentially the same story, ""Jacob's Ladder"" - they seem to have decided that a concatenation of slightly unsettling scenes, nicely shot, snappily edited, and wrapped up with a cool soundtrack is an adequate substitute. It isn't. There's a fine line between confusion that intrigues (David Lynch) and confusion that bores (film school undergrads), and ""Stay"" spends way too much time on the wrong side of it. In the best twist movies, you never see it coming. Here, the indeterminability of everything demands it from the outset and you just can't wait for it to arrive. What's happening isn't frightening enough, nor compelling enough - though it is, again, in ""Jacob's Ladder"" - for you to remain very interested otherwise. It's like a mystery without clues. We're not even given a red herring to cling to; never offered a plausible explanation for what is happening until the very end.The fundamental problem seems to be that Ewan McGregor's Sam Foster is posited as the central character, so all your effort goes into figuring out what is happening to him, when Ryan Gosling's Henry Letham is actually the one you should be thinking about, the one whose story this is. Unless, of course, you read the dissolves and frequent line-crossing in the editing and the occasional reference to twins to indicate that Sam is another part of Henry, although why his dying brain should construct such an elaborate third-person scenario is never justified. As others have noted, the film goes to extraordinarily elaborate lengths trying to explore this convergence without making you feel for a moment that this is interesting or meaningful, let alone plausible. Ultimately, you just get the feeling you're being elaborately toyed with, so you simply disengage, enjoy the music and the images, and wait for the big reveal. When it comes, it isn't even that good - while it does carry some emotional weight, it's ultimately as unmotivated as what's come before it. At least Jacob Singer had a mission, a goal, something he had to do in order to break free. All Henry seems to have is a brain haemorrhage.Knowing how it ends, I suspect that if you watched this film a few more times you might discover the arcane semiotic system that Forster has presumably deployed here which points to the truth of what's happening, right from the start, e.g. Forster has stated in interviews that McGregor's trousers are stupidly short because that's how Henry would see them from his prone position on the road. Great, but who the hell is going to work that out while watching the film? Nobody, which is why Forster's been forced to explain it in interviews. I really hope such detailed symbolism is there. Films like this should bear repeated viewings. But the real test is whether they work the first time you see them. This one doesn't.",2,"A mystery without clues, a twist without a plot (includes spoilers)",1131667200,"11 11, 2005",2005,4229,"['Lovers', 'Stay', 'accuse', 'critics', 'not', 'understanding', 'movie', 'being', 'so', 'dumb', 'need', 'be', 'spoon-fed', 'Hollywood', 'narrative', 'So', 'let', 'start', 'saying', 'understand', 'know', 'story', 'telling', 'Henry', 'Letham', 'dying', 'road', 'accident', 'what', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'scenario', 'constructed', 'dying', 'brain', 'decision', 'hang', 'give', 'guilt', 'let', 'go', ""n't"", 'fully', 'revealed', 'film', 'final', 'minutes', 'point', 'made', 'abundantly', 'clear', 'So', 'get', 'very', 'old', 'story', 'least', 'as', 'old', 'Ambrose', 'Bierce', 'nineteenth-century', 'short', 'story', 'Occurrence', 'Owl', 'Creek', 'Bridge', 'story', 'fine', 'problem', 'have', 'Stay', 'film', 'insufferably', 'tedious.Twist', 'movies', 'only', 'work', 'when', 'everything', 'twist', 'been', 'internally', 'consistent', 'films', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'Fight', 'Club', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'anything', 'else', 'Shyamalan', 'date', 'work', 'so', 'well', ""'re"", 'entirely', 'drawn', 'what', 'think', 'story', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'final', 'act', ""'ve"", 'been', 'told', 'very', 'different', 'one', 'respect', 'art', 'storytelling', 'something', 'Marc', 'Forster', 'David', 'Benihoff', 'seem', 'have', 'forgotten', 'Rather', 'crafting', 'strong', 'narrative', 'can', 'be', 'radically', 'reinterpreted', 'unexpected', 'final', 'revelation', 'Bierce', 'did', 'Adrian', 'Lyne', 'Bruce', 'Joel', 'Rubin', 'did', 'what', 'essentially', 'same', 'story', 'Jacob', 'Ladder', 'seem', 'have', 'decided', 'concatenation', 'slightly', 'unsettling', 'scenes', 'nicely', 'shot', 'snappily', 'edited', 'wrapped', 'up', 'cool', 'soundtrack', 'adequate', 'substitute', ""n't"", 'fine', 'line', 'confusion', 'intrigues', 'David', 'Lynch', 'confusion', 'film', 'school', 'undergrads', 'Stay', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'wrong', 'side', 'best', 'twist', 'movies', 'never', 'see', 'coming', 'Here', 'indeterminability', 'everything', 'demands', 'outset', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'arrive', 'What', 'happening', ""n't"", 'frightening', 'enough', 'compelling', 'enough', 'again', 'Jacob', 'Ladder', 'remain', 'very', 'interested', 'otherwise', 'mystery', 'clues', ""'re"", 'not', 'even', 'given', 'red', 'herring', 'cling', 'never', 'offered', 'plausible', 'explanation', 'what', 'happening', 'very', 'end.The', 'fundamental', 'problem', 'be', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'Sam', 'Foster', 'posited', 'central', 'character', 'effort', 'figuring', 'out', 'what', 'happening', 'when', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'Henry', 'Letham', 'actually', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'thinking', 'one', 'story', 'Unless', 'course', 'read', 'dissolves', 'frequent', 'line-crossing', 'editing', 'occasional', 'reference', 'twins', 'indicate', 'Sam', 'part', 'Henry', 'why', 'dying', 'brain', 'should', 'construct', 'elaborate', 'third-person', 'scenario', 'never', 'justified', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'film', 'extraordinarily', 'elaborate', 'lengths', 'trying', 'explore', 'convergence', 'making', 'feel', 'moment', 'interesting', 'meaningful', 'let', 'alone', 'plausible', 'Ultimately', 'just', 'get', 'feeling', ""'re"", 'being', 'elaborately', 'toyed', 'simply', 'disengage', 'enjoy', 'music', 'images', 'wait', 'big', 'reveal', 'When', ""n't"", 'even', 'good', 'carry', 'emotional', 'weight', 'ultimately', 'as', 'unmotivated', 'what', 'come', 'least', 'Jacob', 'Singer', 'had', 'mission', 'goal', 'something', 'had', 'do', 'order', 'break', 'free', 'Henry', 'have', 'brain', 'haemorrhage.Knowing', 'how', 'suspect', 'watched', 'film', 'few', 'more', 'times', 'might', 'discover', 'arcane', 'semiotic', 'system', 'Forster', 'presumably', 'deployed', 'here', 'points', 'truth', 'what', 'happening', 'right', 'start', 'e.g', 'Forster', 'stated', 'interviews', 'McGregor', 'trousers', 'are', 'stupidly', 'short', 'how', 'Henry', 'would', 'see', 'prone', 'position', 'road', 'Great', 'who', 'hell', 'going', 'work', 'out', 'watching', 'film', 'Nobody', 'why', 'Forster', 'been', 'forced', 'explain', 'interviews', 'really', 'hope', 'such', 'detailed', 'symbolism', 'there', 'Films', 'should', 'bear', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'real', 'test', 'work', 'first', 'time', 'see', 'one', ""n't""]",N/A

969831,A2G3HEJ2WSRZVP,B000E6ESL2,Tivor,"[0, 1]","Visually, this movie was amazing.  There were so many visual trickeries in this movie that my eyes were glued to the screen, hoping not to miss any cool details.  ""Stay"" heavily deals with the question, ""what is real?"" and if you pay attention to what's going on in the background, you'll be asking ""is this real?"" too.  In fact, I heard one guy in the theater blurt out, ""what the *bleep* is going on??"" in one scene.What I really enjoyed was the fact that the visuals, despite all the cool trickeries, did not seem overwhelming or over the top.  In fact, it came just short of being over the top.  In less capable hands, all the cool camera angles, fades and transitions, filter effects, and interior set pieces would have ended up being overblown and cheesy.  The director Marc Foster and all the people behind cinematography, CG effects, and production design deserve a major standing ovation for their efforts.I'm being more subjective here, but I absolutely loved the music too.  Fittingly atmospheric and trippy, the music adeptly underscored the visuals, and I'll be sure to get the soundtrack CD.However, I have to say that I took objection to the movie's use of the song ""Angel"" by Massive Attack.  Now, I love Massive Attack, and I really like the song ""Angel.""  It's just that I've already heard that same song used in dreamy/trippy scenes in several other movies.  Massive Attack's vibe fits the movie perfectly well, so I don't mind their choice in the band.  But why couldn't they use one of Massive Attack's lesser known but just as atmospheric and trippy songs instead?  Hearing that song in ""Stay"" made me go, ""oh no, not again,"" and took me out of the film.All in all, ""Stay"" was a huge treat for my eyes and ears.Beyond all the production gloss, however, I have to confess that I walked away from the theater feeling a bit underwhelmed.  There just wasn't enough substance to tie it all together.  A lot of the visual cool stuff ended up being just that: cool stuff, and nothing more.  It's like receiving a big gift box, spending time rattling it to guess what's inside, only to unwrap it and discover that it's just one piece of Godiva chocolate in a big fluffy packaging.  Still delicious, and you'd rather have it than not, but at the same time, it's disappointing, and the joy is too fleeting.  Without all the visual fluff, the story of ""Stay"" probably could have been told in one 45-minute ""Outer Limits"" or ""Twilight Zone"" episode.Acting-wise, I thought Ryan Gosling hit the perfect note for his role.  Naomi Watts gave a decent, if not particularly memorable, performance.  Ewan McGregor's performance, however, was a bit of a mixed bag.  There were moments where I thought he nailed it perfectly, and then there were moments where I thought he simply fell flat.  I like Ewan, but he more often than not seems to have at least one such moment in all his films, and that's such a shame.Speaking of which, I have to say that Bob Hoskins was amazing.  He was amazing in ""Unleashed,"" and he was amazing in ""Stay.""  And sadly, his performance will probably go unnoticed by many.Overall, I enjoyed this movie.  I'm a sucker for ""what is real?""-type storylines, and if ""Stay"" had more substance to it, I probably would have given it a 4.5-star rating.  As it is, the movie deserves about 3 or 3.5 stars.  But I really, really loved the visual flair of this film, and I dug the atmosphere it created.  And since Amazon won't let me do ratings in 0.5 increments, I'm bumping it up to a 4-star rating.By the way, if you are interested in watching this film, then do go to a theater and watch it on a big screen.  I feel that ""Stay""'s visual flair just won't be the same on a smaller TV screen.",4,"Substance was slightly lacking, but your eyes and ears will be in heaven.",1130112000,"10 24, 2005",2005,3712,"['Visually', 'movie', 'was', 'amazing', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'visual', 'trickeries', 'movie', 'eyes', 'were', 'glued', 'screen', 'hoping', 'not', 'miss', 'cool', 'details', 'Stay', 'heavily', 'question', 'what', 'real', 'pay', 'attention', 'what', 'going', 'background', ""'ll"", 'be', 'asking', 'real', 'too', 'fact', 'heard', 'one', 'guy', 'theater', 'blurt', 'what', '*bleep*', 'going', 'one', 'scene.What', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'fact', 'visuals', 'cool', 'trickeries', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'overwhelming', 'top', 'fact', 'came', 'just', 'short', 'being', 'top', 'less', 'capable', 'hands', 'cool', 'camera', 'angles', 'fades', 'transitions', 'filter', 'effects', 'interior', 'set', 'pieces', 'would', 'have', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'overblown', 'cheesy', 'director', 'Marc', 'Foster', 'people', 'cinematography', 'CG', 'effects', 'production', 'design', 'deserve', 'major', 'standing', 'ovation', 'efforts.I', ""'m"", 'being', 'more', 'subjective', 'here', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'music', 'too', 'Fittingly', 'atmospheric', 'trippy', 'music', 'adeptly', 'underscored', 'visuals', ""'ll"", 'be', 'sure', 'get', 'soundtrack', 'CD.However', 'have', 'say', 'took', 'objection', 'movie', 'use', 'song', 'Angel', 'Massive', 'Attack', 'Now', 'love', 'Massive', 'Attack', 'really', 'song', 'Angel', 'just', ""'ve"", 'already', 'heard', 'same', 'song', 'used', 'dreamy/trippy', 'scenes', 'several', 'other', 'movies', 'Massive', 'Attack', 'vibe', 'movie', 'perfectly', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'choice', 'band', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'use', 'one', 'Massive', 'Attack', 'lesser', 'known', 'just', 'atmospheric', 'trippy', 'songs', 'instead', 'Hearing', 'song', 'Stay', 'made', 'go', 'oh', 'not', 'again', 'took', 'film.All', 'Stay', 'was', 'huge', 'treat', 'eyes', 'ears.Beyond', 'production', 'gloss', 'however', 'have', 'confess', 'walked', 'away', 'theater', 'feeling', 'bit', 'underwhelmed', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'substance', 'tie', 'together', 'lot', 'visual', 'cool', 'stuff', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'just', 'cool', 'stuff', 'nothing', 'more', 'receiving', 'big', 'gift', 'box', 'spending', 'time', 'rattling', 'guess', 'what', 'inside', 'only', 'unwrap', 'discover', 'just', 'one', 'piece', 'Godiva', 'chocolate', 'big', 'fluffy', 'packaging', 'Still', 'delicious', ""'d"", 'rather', 'have', 'not', 'same', 'time', 'disappointing', 'joy', 'too', 'fleeting', 'visual', 'fluff', 'story', 'Stay', 'probably', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'told', 'one', '45-minute', 'Outer', 'Limits', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'episode.Acting-wise', 'thought', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'hit', 'perfect', 'note', 'role', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'gave', 'decent', 'not', 'particularly', 'memorable', 'performance', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'performance', 'however', 'was', 'bit', 'mixed', 'bag', 'were', 'moments', 'where', 'thought', 'nailed', 'perfectly', 'then', 'were', 'moments', 'where', 'thought', 'simply', 'fell', 'flat', 'Ewan', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'have', 'least', 'one', 'such', 'moment', 'films', 'shame.Speaking', 'have', 'say', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'was', 'amazing', 'was', 'amazing', 'Unleashed', 'was', 'amazing', 'Stay', 'sadly', 'performance', 'will', 'probably', 'go', 'unnoticed', 'many.Overall', 'enjoyed', 'movie', ""'m"", 'sucker', 'what', 'real', '-type', 'storylines', 'Stay', 'had', 'more', 'substance', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'given', '4.5-star', 'rating', 'movie', '3', '3.5', 'stars', 'really', 'really', 'loved', 'visual', 'flair', 'film', 'dug', 'atmosphere', 'created', 'Amazon', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'do', 'ratings', '0.5', 'increments', ""'m"", 'bumping', '4-star', 'rating.By', 'way', 'are', 'interested', 'watching', 'film', 'then', 'do', 'go', 'theater', 'watch', 'big', 'screen', 'feel', 'Stay', 'visual', 'flair', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'same', 'smaller', 'TV', 'screen']",N/A

It is a tantalizing question, and you will never know it, but at least it is true that `Stay' shares elements commonly found in recent thrillers that benefit from the spooky, supernatural elements (whatever they are). If Ewan McGregor plays a psychiatrist in New York, and finds his new patient Henry (Ryan Gosling) can predict the change of the weather, it is definitely a thriller. Not only that; Henry declares he is going to die in three days; Henry insists that a blind chess player (Bob Hoskins) is actually his father. So who is Henry, or where are we now?Frankly, some of us do not care, and I am among them. The greatest problem of the film is, for all the intriguing and mesmerizing tricks of visuals and editing, the film gets boring soon. Now don't get me wrong here before you dismiss my review, for I know some thrillers do not necessarily needs a single, definite answer. Thrillers can be open to multiple interpretations, and they can be still good thrillers. But `Stay' is not one of them, throwing in clues, visual or verbal, all of which just create confusion, the simplest confusion that refuses to stimulate our brains.Many people say that 'Stay's is confusing, but here is the real reason for our complaint about the confusion in `Stay.' - it is boring. Now take a look at another kind of confusion, which is also mind-boggling but more intriguing than this one. Yes, another Naomi Watts `thriller' `Mullholand Dr.' which is more challenging, audacious, even ridiculous, but still more fascinating than `Stay.' I know it is not fair to compare Mark Forster with David Lynch, for no one can think like the latter, but at least the nightmarish feeling of `Stay' could have been developed into something more other-worldly (like the Hollywood of Lynch's own vision). But Forster even does not explore that direction, stopping in the realm of pretty conventional supernatural thrillers.I am truly disappointed with the film because it is exceptionally well-acted. McGregor shows the depth of the character while Naomi Watts, despite her underwritten role, brings certain amount of warmth and humanity into the film's world, which should be less about the rather flashy camera and more about Henry and his world itself.",2,"For All its Striking Visual Flair, Not Intriguing as 'Thriller' and Not Fascinating as Something Else",1151625600,"06 30, 2006",2006,2616,"['Many', 'people', 'quite', 'understandably', 'dismiss', 'Stay', 'confusing', 'incoherent', 'mess', 'be', 'supernatural', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'defend', 'film', 'saying', 'disappointed', 'audiences', 'are', 'actually', 'misinformed', 'content', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'promoted', 'something', 'other', 'thriller.Which', 'side', 'right', 'tantalizing', 'question', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'least', 'true', 'Stay', 'shares', 'elements', 'commonly', 'found', 'recent', 'thrillers', 'benefit', 'spooky', 'supernatural', 'elements', 'are', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'psychiatrist', 'New', 'York', 'new', 'patient', 'Henry', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'can', 'predict', 'change', 'weather', 'definitely', 'thriller', 'Not', 'only', 'Henry', 'going', 'die', 'three', 'days', 'Henry', 'blind', 'chess', 'player', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'actually', 'father', 'who', 'Henry', 'where', 'are', 'now', 'Frankly', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'am', 'greatest', 'problem', 'film', 'intriguing', 'mesmerizing', 'tricks', 'visuals', 'editing', 'film', 'boring', 'soon', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'here', 'dismiss', 'review', 'know', 'thrillers', 'do', 'not', 'necessarily', 'single', 'definite', 'answer', 'Thrillers', 'can', 'be', 'open', 'multiple', 'interpretations', 'can', 'be', 'still', 'good', 'thrillers', 'Stay', 'not', 'one', 'throwing', 'clues', 'visual', 'verbal', 'just', 'create', 'confusion', 'simplest', 'confusion', 'stimulate', 'brains.Many', 'people', 'say', ""'Stay"", 'confusing', 'here', 'real', 'reason', 'complaint', 'confusion', 'Stay', 'boring', 'Now', 'take', 'look', 'kind', 'confusion', 'also', 'mind-boggling', 'more', 'intriguing', 'one', 'Yes', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'thriller', 'Mullholand', 'Dr.', 'more', 'challenging', 'audacious', 'even', 'ridiculous', 'still', 'more', 'fascinating', 'Stay', 'know', 'not', 'fair', 'compare', 'Mark', 'Forster', 'David', 'Lynch', 'one', 'can', 'think', 'latter', 'least', 'nightmarish', 'feeling', 'Stay', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'developed', 'something', 'more', 'other-worldly', 'Hollywood', 'Lynch', 'own', 'vision', 'Forster', 'even', 'not', 'explore', 'direction', 'stopping', 'realm', 'pretty', 'conventional', 'supernatural', 'thrillers.I', 'am', 'truly', 'disappointed', 'film', 'exceptionally', 'well-acted', 'McGregor', 'depth', 'character', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'underwritten', 'role', 'certain', 'amount', 'warmth', 'humanity', 'film', 'world', 'should', 'be', 'less', 'rather', 'flashy', 'camera', 'more', 'Henry', 'world']",N/A

It's a group of people that for one haven't seen a little movie named ""Mulholland Drive"", and think that because you like this movie you are, per se, 'intelligent'. I say this because the most frequent attack I hear in an arguement over this movie is 'You didn't like it because you didn't understand it; because you were confused'.Not true, I understood it, I understood it quite well. If you're watching this because you're waiting for the next big 'cult' film since ""Donnie Darko"", pass; or if you're watching it because that guy off ""The Notebook"" is a main, pass.

As Sam and Henry get to know one another, the line between what is real and what isn't becomes blurred. By the end of the film, the viewer feels as Sam and Henry do; confused, cloudy and like they are living in a dream.Stay is one of the most visually stunning, dreamlike, hypnotic, and brilliant pieces of film you will ever have the pleasure of viewing. The story moves along with such grace and surreality that the viewer begins to feel a part of the film. Every aspect of the movie is crafted with perfection. There is not a second of film or note of music that does not, in some way, stimulate the mind and enhance the story. The attention to detail in Stay is shocking compared to what generally passes as movie making.Ewan McGregor and Ryan Gosling deliver acting brilliance, and are joined by the exceptional performances of Naomi Watts and Bob Hoskins. There isn't a misplaced line, or unbelievable moment in the film.Where Stay excels is at creating an intense experience; an immersion in the story that lacks in most modern films. I felt completely lost to myself while watching the movie. Few films deliver such immersion.Some will say that the film is ""complicated"" or ""artsy."" There are many pretentious films that exist to call attention to the director/writer/producer, etc. Stay is not one of them. Every second of film in Stay is crafted to enhance the story, and enhance the story it does.This is not a film for everyone, and I can see where some may not like it. Stay is non-linear, like great poetry, music, art and life. It does not go where you want it to go, or where so many films have conditioned our mind that it should go. Stay stays on its own course, and in doing so treats you to a haunting movie experience that you will not soon forgot, and a movie you will watch over and over again.Total Score (out of 100) = 10050 (out of 50).
