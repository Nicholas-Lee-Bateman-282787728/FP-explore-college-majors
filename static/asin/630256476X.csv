A master piece made by AIC/SouEShinSha/Hirano Toshihiro. The original story came from Gakino, who married Hirano later.The animation made a unpreceded success in illustrating Miyu's soul. The music is astonishing, made by Kawai Genji, and still very popular today. There are four episodes in this series, and the episode 3 is a really good one.Here is the introduction for all of the 4 episodes: Episode 1 - The background, introduces Miyu and Himiko. Episode 2 - The plot, shows Miyu's skills to handle things around her. Episode 3 - The life, talks how Miyu thinks about her life, both as a vampire and as a lady. Episode 4 - The shock, which looks back into the history and gives the truths - that how and where Miyu came from, and what Himiko really is.In the 1980's the golden age of Japanimation (before the bubble bursts), this one is literally a must-see for japanimation fans. I couldn't recommend you more that you got to experience this one; However, the pack format and schedule are arguable.

320913,A3KGYTO6CF8MGF,630256476X,"Clarissa ""MoonGoddess""","[3, 3]","Originally released in the late 80s, this anime is a bit outdated but thanks to a fine remastering of vol.'s One and Two of the VPM (Vampire Princess Miyu) OAV's that came out before the more recent TV series, which I haven't seen yet but is said to be more fluff, the picture and sound quality are just like new.Eternally 13, Miyu is a vampire unlike any other. She often appears as a schoolgirl in broad daylight with an innocent, childlike persona, but a hidden darkness lies within her falsified demeanor (or is it?). Her laughter rises up into the air, echoing all around you, cutting through those who desire her razor sharp kiss, yet she claims to not be the monster that spiritualist Himiko makes her out to be for her destiny is to capture and return the Shinma (creatures that are half-Demon, half-God) to the darkness where hence they came from, but with the help of her devoted guardian, Larva, who was once a evil Shinma himself. And the reason for him being bound to Miyu's side as well as trapped in the mask he always wears is later revealed in the last episode on vol. Two: ""Frozen Time"", where you come to know Miyu as a human and learn of her fate to become The Chosen One.In ""Unearthly Kyoto,"" Himiko travels to the ancient capital of Japan to exorcise a slumbering child, only to be confronted with a wave of vampire attacks. Here she meets the mysterious Miyu and her silent, enigmatic companion. Is Miyu behind the attacks? Or does she, too, seek the real culprit? And if so, why?In ""A Banquet of Marionettes"" (my second favorite episode), Himiko is hired to investigate several mysterious disappearances at a school. At the site of each, a strange doll has been found. Here she again meets Miyu, now apparently a student. Miyu has designs on the body, and perhaps the soul, of the school hero, Kei. But so, it seems, does another...Extras on this DVD include a lavish image gallery set to the gorgeous, melancholy music of Kawai Kenji (the soundtrack is wonderful!) and previews for other anime's available from AnimEigo.[Run Time: 50 minutes]",5,"Is she friend, or fiend?",1067299200,"10 28, 2003",2003,2067,"['Originally', 'released', 'late', '80s', 'anime', 'bit', 'outdated', 'thanks', 'fine', 'remastering', 'vol', 'One', 'Two', 'VPM', 'Vampire', 'Princess', 'Miyu', 'OAV', 'came', 'out', 'more', 'recent', 'TV', 'series', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'said', 'be', 'more', 'fluff', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'just', 'new.Eternally', '13', 'Miyu', 'vampire', 'other', 'often', 'schoolgirl', 'broad', 'daylight', 'innocent', 'childlike', 'persona', 'hidden', 'darkness', 'falsified', 'demeanor', 'laughter', 'up', 'air', 'echoing', 'cutting', 'who', 'desire', 'razor', 'sharp', 'kiss', 'not', 'be', 'monster', 'spiritualist', 'Himiko', 'out', 'be', 'destiny', 'capture', 'return', 'Shinma', 'creatures', 'are', 'half-Demon', 'half-God', 'darkness', 'where', 'hence', 'came', 'help', 'devoted', 'guardian', 'Larva', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'evil', 'Shinma', 'reason', 'being', 'bound', 'Miyu', 'side', 'as', 'well', 'trapped', 'mask', 'always', 'later', 'revealed', 'last', 'episode', 'vol', 'Two', 'Frozen', 'Time', 'where', 'come', 'know', 'Miyu', 'human', 'learn', 'fate', 'become', 'Chosen', 'One.In', 'Unearthly', 'Kyoto', 'Himiko', 'travels', 'ancient', 'capital', 'Japan', 'exorcise', 'slumbering', 'child', 'only', 'be', 'confronted', 'wave', 'vampire', 'attacks', 'Here', 'mysterious', 'Miyu', 'silent', 'enigmatic', 'companion', 'Miyu', 'attacks', 'too', 'seek', 'real', 'culprit', 'so', 'why', 'A', 'Banquet', 'Marionettes', 'second', 'favorite', 'episode', 'Himiko', 'hired', 'investigate', 'several', 'mysterious', 'disappearances', 'school', 'site', 'strange', 'doll', 'been', 'found', 'Here', 'again', 'meets', 'Miyu', 'now', 'apparently', 'student', 'Miyu', 'designs', 'body', 'perhaps', 'soul', 'school', 'hero', 'Kei', 'so', 'Extras', 'DVD', 'include', 'lavish', 'image', 'gallery', 'set', 'gorgeous', 'melancholy', 'music', 'Kawai', 'Kenji', 'soundtrack', 'wonderful', 'previews', 'other', 'anime', 'available', 'AnimEigo', '[', 'Run', 'Time', '50', 'minutes', ']']",N/A
320914,ALE78K49RKLE9,630256476X,"""gabeegs""","[1, 1]","I Found Vampire Princess Miyu to be a refreshing tale that had the old school animation that I often find myself drawn to.  The same style that is seen in such other titles such as Venus Wars and Akira.  The animation does not rival that of Akira but the style and art are very powerful.  After the first viewing of this title I didn't know what to think.  I found myself wanting to watch it again though, but I wasn't too sure why.  As I watched them again I realized that there was a certain charm to them that nothing else that I had seen could compare to it.  The story could have used a little bit of work because at some point you start to ask yourself what drives this character.

320915,A26O0T192IBKY1,630256476X,J. Alford,"[0, 0]","Before the anime TV series was brought out here as part of Tokyopop's short-lived premiere into the world of American releasing of anime, there was this gorgeous 4-episode OVA series from the 80s. With numerous mini-series of the manga having been published into the States through Antarctic Press and then Studio Ironcat, die-hard otaku out here first fell in love with this in the original anime. Directed by Dangaioh creator Toshiki Hirano, this anime broke some serious ground for its time considering OVAs were still getting the bearings in the Japanese market.Throughout Japan, mankind has been plagued by hidden monsters called shinma, which are apparently the spawn of gods and demons. A daywalker vampire &#34;princess&#34; named Miyu and her masked shinma underling Larva set out to remove all the shinma, partially because Miyu believes they're infringing on her territory, but it's also part of some duty she's been born into. She masquerades as an average schoolgirl by day, and sets out to do the Buffy thing by night. Miyu comes across Himiko, a professional spiritualist who acts as her own personal Van Helsing, stalking her believing Miyu to be pure evil while at the same time taking on various supernatural cases that might lead to her. Among her X-Files, Himiko's cases include a rich boy who sells his soul to a marionette shinma, the vengeful ghost of a deceased girl, and a living suit of samurai armor. Miyu dispatches her prey either by writing the shinma's name which sends it back to the spirit world, or by literally killing it with fire! Her powers aren't just the standard vampire ones, as she can also seem to shoot out beams of energy and teleporting, so she's like an X-Man among vampires, even though there aren't any other Draculas who show up in the series.The original manga itself actually acts as a middle ground between the OVA and the TV series, even thought its never fully confirmed that the TV series was a sequal to the OVA or its own separate take on the story. There was also the New Vampire Princess Miyu sequal manga, as well as the Vampire Princess Yui spinoff manga that are worth looking into. The OVA series is still on Animego's dwindling catalog of old school anime titles, even though its available as two separate volumes instead of a single collected DVD, but still worth adding to your library.",4,Beware Buffy!,1396137600,"03 30, 2014",2014,2354,"['anime', 'TV', 'series', 'was', 'brought', 'out', 'here', 'part', 'Tokyopop', 'short-lived', 'premiere', 'world', 'American', 'releasing', 'anime', 'was', 'gorgeous', '4-episode', 'OVA', 'series', '80s', 'numerous', 'mini-series', 'manga', 'having', 'been', 'published', 'States', 'Antarctic', 'Press', 'then', 'Studio', 'Ironcat', 'die-hard', 'otaku', 'here', 'first', 'fell', 'love', 'original', 'anime', 'Directed', 'Dangaioh', 'creator', 'Toshiki', 'Hirano', 'anime', 'broke', 'serious', 'ground', 'time', 'considering', 'OVAs', 'were', 'still', 'getting', 'bearings', 'Japanese', 'market.Throughout', 'Japan', 'mankind', 'been', 'plagued', 'hidden', 'monsters', 'called', 'shinma', 'are', 'apparently', 'spawn', 'gods', 'demons', 'daywalker', 'vampire', '34', 'princess', '34', 'named', 'Miyu', 'masked', 'shinma', 'underling', 'Larva', 'set', 'out', 'remove', 'shinma', 'partially', 'Miyu', ""'re"", 'infringing', 'territory', 'also', 'part', 'duty', 'been', 'born', 'average', 'schoolgirl', 'day', 'out', 'do', 'Buffy', 'thing', 'night', 'Miyu', 'Himiko', 'professional', 'spiritualist', 'who', 'own', 'personal', 'Van', 'Helsing', 'stalking', 'believing', 'Miyu', 'be', 'pure', 'evil', 'while', 'same', 'time', 'taking', 'various', 'supernatural', 'cases', 'might', 'lead', 'X-Files', 'Himiko', 'cases', 'include', 'rich', 'boy', 'who', 'soul', 'marionette', 'shinma', 'vengeful', 'ghost', 'deceased', 'girl', 'living', 'suit', 'samurai', 'armor', 'Miyu', 'prey', 'writing', 'shinma', 'name', 'back', 'spirit', 'world', 'literally', 'killing', 'fire', 'powers', 'are', ""n't"", 'just', 'standard', 'vampire', 'ones', 'can', 'also', 'seem', 'shoot', 'out', 'beams', 'energy', 'teleporting', 'X-Man', 'vampires', 'even', 'are', ""n't"", 'other', 'Draculas', 'who', 'show', 'up', 'series.The', 'original', 'manga', 'actually', 'middle', 'ground', 'OVA', 'TV', 'series', 'even', 'thought', 'never', 'fully', 'confirmed', 'TV', 'series', 'was', 'sequal', 'OVA', 'own', 'separate', 'take', 'story', 'was', 'also', 'New', 'Vampire', 'Princess', 'Miyu', 'sequal', 'manga', 'as', 'well', 'Vampire', 'Princess', 'Yui', 'spinoff', 'manga', 'are', 'worth', 'looking', 'OVA', 'series', 'still', 'Animego', 'dwindling', 'catalog', 'old', 'school', 'anime', 'titles', 'even', 'available', 'two', 'separate', 'volumes', 'instead', 'single', 'collected', 'DVD', 'still', 'worth', 'adding', 'library']",N/A

Shinma feed on human misery and disaster, which they accomplish through a variety of seductive schemes.  Miyu's companion on this lonely, and often grim, task is Larva, a Shinma with whom she has shared blood.  In these early stories, it is never clear if the hero of the stories is Miyu or Himiko, a young spiritualist who perceives Miyu as a threat just as great as the demons the vampire hunts.In the first episode, ""Unearthly Kyoto,"" Himiko comes to the city to investigate the strange circumstances surrounding young princess Aiko, who pricked her finger on a rose, and now has been unconscious for 60 days.  At first, this seems to have nothing to do with a series of deaths in which the victims are found drained of blood.  It is only when Himiko is confronted by the creature doing the killing and Miyu who is hunting it, that she comes to believe that Aiko is more than a victim of a tragedy.Then, in ""Banquet of Marionettes,""  Himiko, hired to find and eerie doll that has suddenly appeared and disappeared, again crosses Miyu's path.  This time Himiko is granted insight into Miyu's own struggle with ninjo and giri (duty and desire) when the vampire competes with a Shinma for the love of a boy.  However, Miyu is frustrated as we watch this Kabuki-like puppet show unfold.Artistically and story-wise, these OAV episodes are the best of the Miyu series so far.  The work, often very dark and Gothic provides perfect settings for the disquieting, tragic tales.  What the TV series has that the OAV does not is a high standard of animation, while these tales are most often drawn minimalistically against a beautiful, but static background.
