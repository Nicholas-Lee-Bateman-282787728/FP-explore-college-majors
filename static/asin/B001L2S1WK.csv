The movie follows a director who is looking for a woman to meet his needs and perhaps inspire him to make his next movie. This film gradually unfolds as if we are walking about the streets of a man's past who is looking for his future.This blu-ray looks gorgeous and is perhaps Antonioni's most sumptuous film. The film has been remastered and cleaned up. The actual disc has no special features as one might typically expect with a Criterion release, but there is a booklet with an essay by the critic John Powers, and a 1982 interview with Antonioni by the critic Gideon Bachman.",4,A film that gradually unfolds....,1323043200,"12 5, 2011",2011,693,"['Identification', 'Woman', '1982', 'directed', 'Michelangelo', 'Antonioni', 'Passenger', 'L', 'Avventura', 'Blowup', 'movie', 'director', 'who', 'looking', 'woman', 'meet', 'needs', 'perhaps', 'inspire', 'make', 'next', 'movie', 'film', 'gradually', 'are', 'walking', 'streets', 'man', 'past', 'who', 'looking', 'future.This', 'blu-ray', 'looks', 'gorgeous', 'perhaps', 'Antonioni', 'most', 'sumptuous', 'film', 'film', 'been', 'remastered', 'cleaned', 'up', 'actual', 'disc', 'special', 'features', 'one', 'might', 'typically', 'expect', 'Criterion', 'release', 'booklet', 'essay', 'critic', 'John', 'Powers', '1982', 'interview', 'Antonioni', 'critic', 'Gideon', 'Bachman']",N/A
1212932,A2ULQOGN59LDNK,B001L2S1WK,Richard J. Brzostek,"[0, 0]","Identification of a Woman is an Italian film about an Italian director.  I find the director, Niccolo (Tomas Milian), to be an interesting character as he is both artistic and intelligent, yet not a push over.  The story begins when Niccolo gets a call from a mysterious man that wants to meet with him.  When Niccolo sees him, he gives Niccolo a very vague threat about continuing to see a particular woman will result in some kind of trouble.  Shortly later, Niccolo begins a passionate affair with a younger woman named Mavi (Daniela Silverio).  Although Mavi says she doesn't know much about Niccolo, I would say she is even more mysterious.  I also found it mysterious that he got a threat about not seeing her before he met her (and I watched it three times to confirm that this is the sequence of events).  In the big scheme of things, this is a minor detail and shouldn't be worried about too much.But the mysteries only grow in this film.  Mavi disappears after some time of dealing with the stalkers spying on Niccolo and having to make their affair secretive.  So as intense as their passions were for each other, the flames between Mavi and Niccolo seem to be extinguished abruptly, which isn't acceptable at all for Niccolo.  He is driven to find out what happened and who was behind the threats.  Niccolo then meets another woman named Ida (Christine Boisson) that not only helps him put some closure to the mystery, but also becomes his new girlfriend.  Ida is quite different than Mavi and presents Niccolo with a situation in which he must decide if he wants to continue their relationship.What is fascinating about the movie is that the story is basically normal, but it is also bizarre.  While everything that happens isn't too far from everyday events, they are also pretty extraordinary.  I found Identification of a Woman to be a intriguing movie, but it also came up short because it left a few details unanswered.  Although those these questions left in our mind may have been intentional, as they provide us with quite a bit to ponder, I still would have preferred more concrete answers.",4,an Italian film about an Italian director,1309737600,"07 4, 2011",2011,2112,"['Identification', 'Woman', 'Italian', 'film', 'Italian', 'director', 'find', 'director', 'Niccolo', 'Tomas', 'Milian', 'be', 'interesting', 'character', 'artistic', 'intelligent', 'yet', 'not', 'push', 'over', 'story', 'when', 'Niccolo', 'call', 'mysterious', 'man', 'meet', 'When', 'Niccolo', 'very', 'vague', 'threat', 'continuing', 'see', 'particular', 'woman', 'will', 'result', 'kind', 'trouble', 'Shortly', 'later', 'Niccolo', 'passionate', 'affair', 'younger', 'woman', 'named', 'Mavi', 'Daniela', 'Silverio', 'Mavi', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'Niccolo', 'would', 'say', 'even', 'more', 'mysterious', 'also', 'found', 'mysterious', 'got', 'threat', 'not', 'seeing', 'met', 'watched', 'three', 'times', 'confirm', 'sequence', 'events', 'big', 'scheme', 'things', 'minor', 'detail', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'worried', 'too', 'much.But', 'mysteries', 'only', 'grow', 'film', 'Mavi', 'time', 'dealing', 'stalkers', 'spying', 'Niccolo', 'having', 'make', 'affair', 'secretive', 'So', 'as', 'intense', 'passions', 'were', 'other', 'flames', 'Mavi', 'Niccolo', 'seem', 'be', 'extinguished', 'abruptly', ""n't"", 'acceptable', 'Niccolo', 'driven', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'who', 'was', 'threats', 'Niccolo', 'then', 'woman', 'named', 'Ida', 'Christine', 'Boisson', 'not', 'only', 'put', 'closure', 'mystery', 'also', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'Ida', 'quite', 'different', 'Mavi', 'presents', 'Niccolo', 'situation', 'must', 'decide', 'continue', 'relationship.What', 'fascinating', 'movie', 'story', 'basically', 'normal', 'also', 'bizarre', 'everything', ""n't"", 'too', 'far', 'everyday', 'events', 'are', 'also', 'pretty', 'extraordinary', 'found', 'Identification', 'Woman', 'be', 'intriguing', 'movie', 'also', 'came', 'up', 'short', 'left', 'few', 'details', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'left', 'mind', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'intentional', 'provide', 'bit', 'ponder', 'still', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'more', 'concrete', 'answers']",N/A

This is a mesmerizing study of familiar Antonioni themes (women, love & sex, the creative process, etc.).  The film is beautiful, one of Antonioni's most beautifully filmed, of particular note is his use of windows, both looking out of them and reflecting from them.  I love the film but would not recommend it for those unfamiliar with Antonioni's other great films.  His films are typically enigmatic and often start slowly. In the beginning, for example, I was unsure of the casting and acting of Tomas Milian.  Eventually, however, as the themes became clearer he seemed an excellent choice.  Antonioni's genius for beautiful location filming is very much on display here as well with beautiful shots of Rome, the Italian countryside, and Venice.  The accompanying essay and interview are excellent, but they are the only special features. I think the film deserves more.",5,An Antonioni Fan,1320105600,"11 1, 2011",2011,985,"['Being', 'Antonioni', 'fan', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'film', 'available', 'Blu-Ray', 'product', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint', 'mesmerizing', 'study', 'familiar', 'Antonioni', 'themes', 'women', 'love', 'sex', 'creative', 'process', 'etc.', 'film', 'beautiful', 'one', 'Antonioni', 'most', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'particular', 'note', 'use', 'windows', 'looking', 'reflecting', 'love', 'film', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'unfamiliar', 'Antonioni', 'other', 'great', 'films', 'films', 'are', 'typically', 'enigmatic', 'often', 'start', 'slowly', 'beginning', 'example', 'was', 'unsure', 'casting', 'acting', 'Tomas', 'Milian', 'Eventually', 'however', 'themes', 'became', 'clearer', 'seemed', 'excellent', 'choice', 'Antonioni', 'genius', 'beautiful', 'location', 'filming', 'very', 'much', 'display', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'beautiful', 'shots', 'Rome', 'Italian', 'countryside', 'Venice', 'accompanying', 'essay', 'interview', 'are', 'excellent', 'are', 'only', 'special', 'features', 'think', 'film', 'more']",N/A

The film is in the best evaluation I can give a ok film. Very weak. Which surprised me Criterion giving it a try releasing it. All the magic is gone. If you watch Fellini's films in the eighties he also changed of course but his films always manage to be very interesting in their own way.
