A fun diversion from the mainstream cookie cutter garbage that seems to dominate tv. Ray Wise has always been a very under rated actor who constantly delivers memorable performances (Robocop & Twin Peaks stand out) and his protrayal of the Devil was fun.

1244655,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B001WAKNCC,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[49, 51]","""Reaper"" was the best new show of the 2007-2008 season and the best new show the CW has yet to offer, and it ended it's first season on a cliffhanger. Two, actually. What would happen on the show, and would the show even return for a second season?. Thankfully, the show did get a reprieve, but not without a price. It would be held back for mid-season. By the time the second season finally premiered, it had been off the air for 2 months shy of a year. Not only that, but came back with less than stellar promotion and was put on opposite ""American Idol"". ""Reaper"" was always 'on the bubble', but it did as well as any show could do with such challenges bestowed on it. Season 1 was cut down 4 episodes because of the writer's strike, and season 2 is cut down 9 episodes, only 13, for being a mid season show. While the series is still the entertaining show it always was, season 2 had some flaws, and the limited time it had certainly didn't help. But we'll get to that....Season 2 finds Sam Oliver(Bret Harrison), Sock(Tyler Labine), Ben(Rick Gonzalez), and Andi(Missy Peregrym)continue to fight the good fight amid Sam's ongoing mission as a bounty hunter for the Devil(Ray Wise), finding escaped souls and sending them back. There are a few new ongoing story arcs this season and some new recurring cast members. Sam continues to find a way out of his deal, his relationship with Andi suffers, and yet there just may be someone who can help. Elsewhere, Sock finds himself attracted to a young woman who turns out to be verrrry close to his family, and Ben begins a relationship with a demon named Nina(Jenny Wade). If that isn't enough, there is the ongoing story of how Sam is dealing with his deal with the devil and how, or if, it's changing him.Season 2 of ""Reaper"" is filled with what we have come to know and love about the show. The wicked humor is there in full force. The fleshed out characters continue to make the show. The potentail that season 1 found itself reaching towards the end of that season is...well, it's somewhat here. And just like season 1, the flaws are very evident as well. There is a lot going on in season 2, and it seems everyone has something going on in their lives, and then some. Sock's storyline seemed funny at first, but soon became kinda unflattering and just ended in a non-satisfying way. Sock is still Sock, but this storyline wasn't flattering for the character. There are also some loose ends that go unnoticed, storylines that aren't capitalized on, storylines that aren't dealt with properly. All in all, season 2 feels a bit disjointed. Whereas season 1 sort of stood still until the latter half not knowing where it's going, season 2 seems to have an idea in mind, but has a lot going on and a much shorter time to pull it, and everything else, off. The 13 episodes in this season definitley is a contributing factor. It's not as tight or as consistent as it should be. But hey, the makers had a lot to do, less time to do it in, and not getting a lot of support from the network. I guess they are doing as well as they can. If season 2 had gotten a full season, it would of had more time to flesh some things out. But ""Reaper"" is so charming and entertaining, even it's setbacks aren't enough to ruin the fun and enjoyment of it all. The actors still do a wonderful job with their roles, and you can tell they are having just as much fun doing the show as we are watching it from the comfort of our couches. Each and every one of them is fitting for their character. I continue to think that Ray Wise is a treasure as the Devil, and Tyler Labine is a comedy star.Season 2 of the show does have a lot to offer. What can you expect with some of the episodes?. The premiere, ""Episode IV : A New Hope"", finds the boys returning home after a trip to find that things have changed at the Work Bench for them(and Andi), and that the Devil has a BIG case for Sam. Episode three, ""The Sweet Science"", introduces Nina to the mix, and her relationship with Ben is one of the season's best highlights. There is a Xander/Anya thing going on here, and the two of them are wonderful together. Definitley sets up for some great comedic moments. ""The Favorite"" adds a new wrinkle to the Sam/Devil mix, when we meet Morgan, a family member of the dark one. Tony the demon makes his welcomed return in ""I Want My Baby Back"", and the gang meet back up with their truly awful high school teacher Mr. Sprong(played by MAD TV vet Michael McDonald)in ""To Sprong, With Love"". One of my favorite episodes this season is ""Underbelly"", in which the whole gang travel to a small town to capture an escaped soul that has turned into a creature and manipulates the town citizens. As of this writing, season 2 still had 2 more episodes to go, ""Business Casualty"", and the likely series finale, ""The Devil And Sam Oliver"".Sadly, it looks as though season 2 will be the last for the series. It's a shame. Even though it hasn't always worked, ""Reaper"" has always been a very fun, entertaining show. The humor aspect is some of the funniest stuff on TV today, and the show had a cool, intriguing premise. The characters that made up the show all had their own well rounded, fleshed out identities, and the cast did an amazing job of bringing them to real, believeable life. Even though season 2 felt a little disjointed and inconsistent in places, it was still a fun ride, filled with hilarious moments, cool characters, and great acting. Reaper has a lot going for it, and still had a lot more to show. It's too bad it may not get the chance to continue to it's full potential.",4,What The Devil?!,1242172800,"05 13, 2009",2009,5598,"['Reaper', 'was', 'best', 'new', 'show', '2007-2008', 'season',

1244657,A33FCLUEQSUD68,B001WAKNCC,Claire,"[0, 0]","This second season of Reaper was great fun. It's worth owning and I have gotten enjoyment out of watching it again and again just as I did with the first one. In this season Sam and his friends continue to work as Satan's bounty hunters capturing escaped souls from hell. There are some new characters in this season who add to the storylines which are now expanded to go beyond simply the capture of the demon of the week. We have the devil's narcissistic lazy son Morgan played by Armie Hammer who sees Sam as competition for Satan's affection since they could be brothers if Sam is really the son of the devil. Sam's friend Ben begins dating a she-demon who initially tries to kill Sam since she sees him as evil. Sock begins a fling with his step-sister. The boys become friends with some good demons who happen to live in the same apartment complex. And Sam's relationship with the devil becomes more complicated just as his relationship with Andie does too.Since the show was cancelled before there could be a season three we are left hanging about many of the show's storylines. However, the episodes are still quirky, wacky and fun like always so there's plenty of enjoyment to be had. The characters and storylines are more expanded this year so that adds to the complexity of the show and makes it more interesting.

1244671,AZUTJARDBNT5L,B001WAKNCC,"R. G. Lee ""rleehistory""","[0, 0]","After watching the second season on DVD, it's no surprise that the show was not renewed. The writers were clearly unsure how to develope the show's premise and take it in new, interesting directions. There are amusing lines and wise cracks in abundance, but the overall plot is aimless and uncertain. New secondary characters, like Sock's step-sister and Sam's demonic half brother, appear, feature prominently for a few episodes, and then vanish abruptly. Memorable characters from the first season, like Mildred of the DMV, either disappear entirely or only make perfunctory appearances. The souls Sam is sent to reclaim aren't as memorable in the first season and the writers almost seem to have lost interest in that aspect of the show's premise. All in all, it feels like a show near the end of its run.Nevertheless, the four young principles are bright and appealing and the chemistry between them is first rate. Ray Wise as the devil is marvelous. Even when the writing falters, the acting is more than enough to keep your attention and to make you want to come back for the next episode. Most sitcoms now center on basically unlikeable people people but, except for the devil of course, the main characters in Reaper were likeable, charming people I looked forward to spending time with. So despite all the problems, this is still head and shoulders above most of what passes for television comedy.

For Sam Oliver (Bret Harrison), his life changed on his 21st birthday when his parents told him that they sold his soul to the Devil (Ray Wise) before he was born. Now, Sam must serve as Devil's bounty hunter and retrieve escaped souls. In this second season, Sam learns that he is the Devil's son but has no desire to become his successor. His best friends Sock (Tyler Labine) and Ben (Rick Gonzalez) fall in love with two unlikely candidates. Andi (Missy Peregrym) questions if she and Sam have a future together. ""Reaper"" is a hilariously well-written supernatural sitcom that amusingly combines elements of humor and fantasy. Ray Wise's enthusiastic performance really shines. The series barely avoided the axe in its first season and was renewed for a 13-episode second season. Unfortunately, the second season was also its last. Despite a few standout episodes, the second season isn't as memorable as the previous one. It focused too much attention on the secondary storylines. The finale was somewhat disappointing and left many key elements unanswered in hopes that the series will somehow return for a third season.If you are expecting some improvements over the previous box set, then you'll be very disappointed. All 13 episodes of the final season are presented in a 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The picture quality is pretty good. The 5.1 Dolby Digital sound isn't impressive but is well balanced. Among special features, your selection is limited. There are no audio commentary tracks and the 15-minute ""The Devil Made Me Do It"" behind-the scenes featurette focuses on the first season production. The only worthy extras that are included in this set, are the 4 deleted scenes and a 8-minute gag reel.

While there had been some talk that the show might be sold to the Sci-Fi or perhaps become a syndicated show, those possibilities seem remote at this point and the last gasp seems to be a fan petition drive to try and keep the show alive.  This really is no surprise as Reaper was always going to be a niche show that struggled to get viewers.Season two featured only 13 episodes and the show was somewhat streamlined to eliminate or at least reduce the number of supporting characters and focus on the core group.  Gone were Sock's ex Josie and Sam's mom and while and his father, gay demon lovers Tony and Steve, and Gladys at the DMV all had their roles reduced in season two.Sock and Ben entered into a couple of very strange romantic relationships as Ben began dating the beautiful demon Nina (Jenny Wade) and Sock started seeing his stepsister Kristen which made for some of the more hilarious moments of show.  Meanwhile Sam was dealing with his own on-again/off again relationship with Andi while seeking a way out of his contract with the Devil.There was a lighter feel to season two and the comedy aspect of the show was ramped up, especially when sarcastic new employee Pesi (Pesi Daruwalla) is added to the cast and is given some of the best lines of the season.  Sam discovers that a man named Alan Townsend escaped his deal with the Devil so much of the season is spent with Sam pursuing Townsend to find out how he did it.""The Favorite"" (the season's 4th episode) introduced Morgan, another son of the Devil and Sam's paternal half-brother.  Morgan is vain, lazy, but clever enough to scheme to make himself look good and Sam look bad in front of their ""father"".Some of the standout episodes include ""Underbelly"" with Sam and the gang on a road trip to hunt down a tentacled demon that lives in an old mine.  In ""To Sprong with Love"" the friends think their old teacher Mr. Sprong, is their next demon target and kidnap him.  Michael McDonald of Mad TV plays Sprong in a comedic tour de force and one of the funniest episodes of the series.In the show's final episode, Sam thinks he may finally way out of his contract by beating the Devil in a challenge.  Sam's choice of games...Quarter Bounce!  And how perfect is that for Sam that this game should be his specialty!Reaper was a fun show that had one of the more unusual casts of characters on TV.  We may never see a Devil more charming and engaging than Ray Wise.  Reaper passed away far too early but this is a show that would have never made it to TV ten years ago...a tribute to how popular genre shows have become.",5,Alas Reaper met its Own Reaper too Soon,1269907200,"03 30, 2010",2010,2741,"['excitement', 'release', 'second', 'season', 'Reaper', 'tempered', 'news', 'CW', 'officially', 'cancelled', 'show', 'two', 'seasons', 'had', 'been', 'talk', 'show', 'might', 'be', 'sold', 'Sci-Fi', 'perhaps', 'become', 'syndicated', 'show', 'possibilities', 'seem', 'remote', 'point', 'last', 'gasp', 'be', 'fan', 'petition', 'drive', 'try', 'keep', 'show', 'alive', 'really', 'surprise', 'Reaper', 'was', 'always', 'going', 'be', 'niche', 'show', 'struggled', 'get', 'viewers.Season', 'two', 'featured', 'only', '13', 'episodes', 'show', 'was', 'somewhat', 'streamlined', 'eliminate', 'least', 'reduce', 'number', 'supporting', 'characters', 'focus', 'core', 'group', 'Gone', 'were', 'Sock', 'ex', 'Josie', 'Sam', 'mom', 'while', 'father', 'gay', 'demon', 'lovers', 'Tony', 'Steve', 'Gladys', 'DMV', 'had', 'roles', 'reduced', 'season', 'two.Sock', 'Ben', 'entered', 'couple', 'very', 'strange', 'romantic', 'relationships', 'Ben', 'began', 'dating', 'beautiful', 'demon', 'Nina', 'Jenny', 'Wade', 'Sock', 'started', 'seeing', 'stepsister', 'Kristen', 'made', 'more', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'show', 'Meanwhile', 'Sam', 'was', 'dealing', 'own', 'on-again/off', 'again', 'relationship', 'Andi', 'seeking', 'way', 'contract', 'Devil.There', 'was', 'lighter', 'feel', 'season', 'two', 'comedy', 'aspect', 'show', 'was', 'ramped', 'up', 'especially', 'when', 'sarcastic', 'new', 'employee', 'Pesi', 'Pesi', 'Daruwalla', 'added', 'cast', 'given', 'best', 'lines', 'season', 'Sam', 'man', 'named', 'Alan', 'Townsend', 'escaped', 'deal', 'Devil', 'so', 'much', 'season', 'spent', 'Sam', 'pursuing', 'Townsend', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'did', 'Favorite', 'season', '4th', 'episode', 'introduced', 'Morgan', 'son', 'Devil', 'Sam', 'paternal', 'half-brother', 'Morgan', 'vain', 'lazy', 'clever', 'enough', 'scheme', 'make', 'look', 'good', 'Sam', 'look', 'bad', 'front', 'father', '.Some', 'standout', 'include', 'Underbelly', 'Sam', 'gang', 'road', 'trip', 'hunt', 'down', 'tentacled', 'demon', 'old', 'mine', 'Sprong', 'Love', 'friends', 'think', 'old', 'teacher', 'Mr.', 'Sprong', 'next', 'demon', 'target', 'kidnap', 'Michael', 'McDonald', 'Mad', 'TV', 'Sprong', 'comedic', 'tour', 'force', 'one', 'funniest', 'episodes', 'series.In', 'show', 'final', 'episode', 'Sam', 'may', 'finally', 'way', 'contract', 'beating', 'Devil', 'challenge', 'Sam', 'choice', 'games', 'Quarter', 'Bounce', 'how', 'perfect', 'Sam', 'game', 'should', 'be', 'specialty', 'Reaper', 'was', 'fun', 'show', 'had', 'one', 'more', 'unusual', 'casts', 'characters', 'TV', 'may', 'never', 'see', 'Devil', 'more', 'charming', 'engaging', 'Ray', 'Wise', 'Reaper', 'passed', 'away', 'far', 'too', 'early', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'made', 'TV', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'tribute', 'how', 'popular', 'genre', 'shows', 'have', 'become']",Reaper: Season 2
