Kathleen Turner especially is excellent, as the conflicted mother of a not-so-perfect family and also a very devout church goer in a (mostly) very judgmental church. She shows up for everyone, all the time, even when there are problems,and she is a mama bear for everyone she cares about  -- but she wears her worries on her face and in her body language so it is not difficult to see how she is really feeling inside.  But of course most of us have seen Turner before, and she has always been good so this is no revelation.  She is simply older and pleasantly plump now, and in many ways a more lovable actress now, one that reminds me of my own mom.  The other actors are equally fine, including her daughter, son, husband, priest ( Richard Chamberland, a nice touch) and her rival at church.  The sets and locations also add to the familiar tone of the film.

1535263,A328S9RN3U5M68,B007OWW6V8,Grady Harp,"[2, 3]","Beginners Anne Renton, director, and Paula Goldberg and Claire V. Riley, writers, had a good idea when framing this story about a mother's bigotry hidden under the cloak of Catholicism, and the film could have been extremely pertinent in today's milieu of the President's sanctioning of same sex marriage.  The problem is the script is so weak and pasted together that it gives very little weight to the actors to bring off the message that could have been important. Yes, some viewers may rile that the film is anti-Catholic but it is not - it is just anti-prejudice.Eileen Cleary (Kathleen Turner, crippled by a weak script until the very end of the film), a woman who devotes 98 % of her life to tending to her church duties and caring for the elderly who are house bound and other good Christian deeds, has been nominated as Catholic Woman of the year: the other nominee is Agnes Dunn (Sharon Lawrence), an almost equal do-gooder - both nominated by Monsignor Murphy (Richard Chamberlain). Eileen's family must be approved for the award and that is when the balloon of Eileen's glee seems to pop: her husband Frank (Michael McGrady) is an alcoholic who has been sober 15 years and must attend AA meetings; her son Frank, Jr (Jason Ritter) has left his wife and family for a manicurist whom he loves; and her daughter Shannon (Emily Deschanel, a successful 30-something lawyer and 5 months pregnant, is about to marry her girlfriend Angela (Angelique Cabral) in a same sex wedding to be performed by Father Joe (Scott Michael Campbell). Eileen is disturbed that Anglea's parents (Elizabeth Pe&ntilde;a  and Gregory Zaragoza) approve and will host the wedding. Desperate to win the award, Eileen is conflicted between shame over her family and still desiring to do the right thing by them. Unable to accept any of their choices her family begins to splinter, with even her husband threatening to leave. How it all turns the corner is when Eileen finally reveals a secret of her own she has always had to hide for fear of being judged a bad Catholic. The ending is the best part of the film as it finally shows Eileen to be a more complete human being and things seem to fall in line.The cast tries hard to make this all work and succeed as far as the script will allow. Katheen Turner, looking cosmetically and adipose altered, struggles with her role, but by film's end she seems to succeed in conveying the message of the film.

1535269,A1VOPP2OFITP7D,B007OWW6V8,June Bug,"[1, 2]","If you are a Christian, get ready to be portrayed as a bigoted, two-faced, poser because you believe that marriage is between a man and a woman and that adultery is wrong.  As an added bonus, you will come across as a shrill, wrinkled, old bitty, who whines that her husband's alcoholism impacted you too.I really liked Kathleen Turner, I had no idea that she would be so willing to portray the old fashioned woman, who is stuck in the past.Her family they are really nice and though she doesn't approve of her, they generally speak to her in a polite, loving way except in one scene where they really let it all hang out about her shortcomings.Even though her daughter is pregnant and on her way to marry her partner of six years; she obviously isn't happy about it.  Yet, she waits on her daily when her daughter is off work under doctor's orders.  When she miscarries, the mother is on the scene to comfort her while the daughter tells her that she will never understand what it is like to loose a daughter.  Yet, the mother lost the daughter, that her daughter willingly portrayed for 30 years.  That isn't even touched on.  The fact that the mother goes to the commitment ceremony doesn't get her points either because she has an anxiety attack making a scene.  What really bites is that when the mother confesses, that she had an abortion, when her husband was still drinking and threatening divorce, her own loss is ignored.  In fact, she is even more imperfect because she is a ""hypocrite"" according to the movie.I am angry that I watched the entire movie to see where things would go.Spoiler WarningThe mother sees herself as a hypocrite and leaves the church to join her family.  The sad part was when she confesses her abortion because of the possible abandonment while her husband was cheating on her during his active alcoholism; no one comforts her.  This is the key to her ""works"" mentality which is found in some driven people.  She had to earn God's love.  She had never received/or come to believe that she was already forgiven for taking the life of her child.This entire movie distorts many of the key tenets of Christianity.We believe:We are saved by the shed blood of Christ the son of God.We don't believe:We are perfect.We believe:that the Bible is the word of God, and our guide to live in a pleasing manner and escape choices that may have painful consequences.We don't believe:that we can select and choose only parts of the Bible to follow and ignore that which doesn't suit us or our desires.We believe:God loves all his children.We don't believe:God only loves Christians.We believe:that there is a judgment after physical death based only on if we loved Jesus and allowed him to cleanse our sins.We don't believe:that you get ""recycled"" and that your behavior/karma brings you a better or worse depending on this present manifestation.We believe:God is love.  Christians are called to love as Christ did.We don't believe:That we should condemn people who aren't followers as less important or valuable; however, we can't truly love someone without pointing out their destructive or anti-Bible behaviors because even Christ challenged people to live righteously before God.When you love someone, you tell the truth with love and graciousness.If I'm lost, I will ask for directions.

This is certainly the case here for Kathleen Turner, who once reigned in Hollywood as the adventurous ""hot babe.""

This time, however, her character is fully engaged--albeit reluctantly--with a host of modern issues facing her husband and children--ranging from homosexuality to marital infidelity.Although her conservative Catholic world is quite alien to me, Turner's compelling acting forced me to care about her character as she struggles to find a place in her heart for her somewhat wayward husband and children.  I was especially touched by her troubled but evolving relationship with her Lesbian daughter, who is played charmingly by Emily Deschanel.  This struggle is highlighted by the scene in which Turner's character reluctantly attends Deschanel's wedding to her long-time partner--only for Turner to bolt from her seat when the times arrives for her daughter to kiss her newly wedded spouse--an awkward exit thwarted by Turner's collision with a waiter carrying glasses of champagne!After seeing this movie, I was surprised to learn that it was considered a comedy!  I really had no inclination to laugh at any point of this movie, as I was constantly enveloped by the feeling of empathy that Turner's powerful performance elicited from me!Later on, however, after thinking about this movie for a while, it occurred to me that Richard Chamberlain did play the priest in a pretty funny way.
