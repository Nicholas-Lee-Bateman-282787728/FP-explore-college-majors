There is something exotic about her. It's something rare and unique and hard to pinpoint. It's not her spoken dialogue that tells the story, it's her amazing facial expressions. It is her  amazing look.In the first film, Katniss and Peeta pulled off an amazing feat in the 74th HUNGER GAMES by both winning in a game where there can be one victor. They have earned the love and admiration of everyone throughout the land. To please their public, they create a fake romance, but trouble is brewing as people rise against their oppression. It is the &#34;romance&#34; between Katniss and Peeta that gives hope to the public.President Snow is about to change the rules with the 75th HUNGER GAMES-the Quarter Quell. Although they have been promised comfort, safety and riches after winning their perspective HUNGER GAMES, the winners are all called back for the 75th games and only one can win.CATCHING FIRE has a slow start as we see Katniss and Peeta living their fake lives as discontent fills the land. Peeta is in love with Katniss as she shows a cold ambivalence toward him. Here heart is elsewhere but is she actually hiding deep emotions for Peeta. Although the first half of CATCHING FIRE drags on, the sparks fly when The Quarter Quell is about to begin and it is breathtaking. The visual effects, the acting, the setting, the story suddenly are of the highest claiber.It's here that Lawrence really shines. The participants are paraded in an arena in front of the excited crowds on their way to appear before President Snow. Katniss and Peeta arrive in a chariot. As they approach President Snow, Katniss gives him a lingering look of hatred and disdain that probably has never been seen on screen before. It's an uncomfortable moment between two enemies and that scene alone is worth seeing the film.Let the games begin and alliances form as not everyone seems eager to fight to the last man or woman. It's an amazing contest with neverending twists. The writing is crisp and the acting is mesmerizing along with the visual effects.

Some of the drama seemed like it was the same as the original hunger games, but with new words. This may have made more sense in the books, but on film it felt too much like the original. The uprising was important to the story, but inevitably the story led from hunting illegally in the woods with a love interest, to choosing who was gonna be in the games, to how do we plan and strategize, to lets show off some skill and test the other people in the game, to the game (complete with people dying, but this time in new and different ways), to her surviving. The ending makes some possible suggestion that in the final movie/book there is less of a focus on the games and more of a focus on the political climate and the impending uprising hinted at in this movie.

Unfortunately for Katniss, her defiance for some of Part 1's rules has begun to cause rebellion in the Districts.  Katniss' natural honesty and desire to do what's right only seems to fuel the rebellion more during the tour.  Fearing a revolution, Snow wants her dead!

That a man somehow in his careless youth provided 693 samples to a sperm bank which resulted in 533 children, of which 140 or so are engaged in a class action lawsuit to discover the identity of Starbuck their daddy. Meanwhile he has debts, and commitment issues with a girlfriend.I went to this movie expecting to see a regular movie, with punch lines and much laughter, the kind of comedy one often goes to see, full of laughs yet instantly forgettable. What I did not expect was a sentimental and somewhat touching movie. I doubt if the Vince Vaughn of 10 years ago could have pulled off this role in quite this way. Yet at times this movie transcends comedy and becomes touching without ever becoming maudlin.To tell you too much about it would be to render an injustice to the spontaneity of your experience. I found it a worthwhile, and enjoyable experience, and am glad I saw it, and I think most people will feel the same way, and it is an original premise, in a world where recycled premises are beaten to death through overuse, and if you're like me you long for something you have not seen before.

1567325,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B008JFUS8M,,"[1, 2]","I have to admit, I was VERY late to the &#8216;Hunger Games&#8217; party.  When the world went crazy for the franchise in written form, I completely tuned it all out.  I was, in my mind, above all that.  This was for teens, right?  I&#8217;m sorry, but I don&#8217;t read those &#8216;Twilight&#8217; books nor do I see those movies and I was not about to waste my time with some teen oriented book on kids killing kids (seriously, why is this a thing?) and so despite all my friend&#8217;s kids raving the books, I looked at them like they were crazy and went on my merry way.  When the film was made, I was also pretty much a staunch objector.  I was looked at as a villain in the fantasy lives of my friend&#8217;s teenage kids who all wore their hair in braids and started pinning every picture they could find of current &#8216;it girl&#8217;, Jennifer Lawrence.  I was kind of adverse to anything Lawrence related at that time.  I had seen a handful of her films, including her Oscar nominated turn in 2010&#8217;s &#8216;Winter&#8217;s Bone&#8217; and I just found her incredibly wooden and uninteresting.Then I was on a plane to Europe and my friend leans over to me and says &#8220;have you read &#8216;The Hunger Games&#8217; yet?&#8221; and I looked at him in shock, like &#8216;WHY ON EARTH DID YOU READ THAT?&#8217; and he proceeds to tell me that he read all three books over the course of a single weekend (he was apparently sick with the flu) because his daughter was reading them and he thought they were great.It just did not compute, like at all.When I got home he wound up lending me the first book and I, begrudgingly, started to read it.  I read it in a weekend and I instantly wanted more.  No, it&#8217;s not a great book.  The writing is actually pretty terrible in parts, and the concept is kind of ridiculous (and seriously, this is for kids?) but the way that the story is told is pretty engaging and I had to admit to myself; I kind of understood the draw.So I saw the movie.I have since become a fan of Jennifer Lawrence.  I know some people don&#8217;t see what I see in her, and I completely understand the aversion to her.  She&#8217;s crude and rude and she babbles and says things that could be perceived as offensive and she seems incredibly attention hungry despite trying to play it all off like she&#8217;s above it, but she&#8217;s hilarious and in a sea of celebrities who SAY.EXACTLY.WHAT.THEY.THINK.WE.WANT.TO.HEAR. I love that she just says whatever comes to her mind.  She also proved me completely wrong about her talent when she blew me away in &#8216;The Silver Linings Playbook&#8217;, so I was not only a fan of her persona, but kind of fell in love with the complete package.  No, she&#8217;s not my favorite actress out there (and I do find her fans kind of ridiculous) but I like her now.Oh, she&#8217;s good as Katniss, since that applies to this particular conversation.Ok, so after seeing &#8216;The Hunger Games&#8217; I was intrigued to where the rest of this story was going to go.  I snatched up the second book, &#8216;Catching Fire&#8217; and prepared myself for the movie.  I kind of hated the book.  It felt like a real slump with drawn out segments that didn&#8217;t further the story and a lazily conceptualized finale that felt like a rehash of the previous &#8216;games&#8217; and left me soured.  It wasn&#8217;t terrible, and it thankfully didn&#8217;t have those stupid mutant dogs, but I was severely letdown.  I knew that I&#8217;d see the movie and I knew that I&#8217;d read &#8216;Mockingjay&#8217; (I haven&#8217;t yet, but I will before the movie is released later this year), but that was more because I hate leaving anything unfinished and so I had to complete the trilogy, but I can&#8217;t say that I was as excited to see &#8216;Catching Fire&#8217; as I had been to see &#8216;The Hunger Games&#8217;.I finally watched this last night, after feeling uncompelled to go to the theater to see it despite being invited by the same friend who lent me the books to begin with.This is one of those rare instances where the film is actually better than the book, and where the sequel is actually better than the original.  Still, this is far from perfect, but where the book felt tedious, redundant and apathetic, the film found ways to make each point feel necessary.  It omitted moments that didn&#8217;t matter and nipped things in the bud, which was quite shocking considering that the movie is almost two and a half hours long.  It all felt so brisk.  Before I knew it, the movie was over and it seriously felt like I had only been in front of the television for like an hour, tops.From a technical standpoint, this film is also a pretty big upgrade.  The visuals are much better this go around, and some of the cinematography is beautiful (but the lighting during the night scenes is awful).  The acting is a mixed bag (Sutherland is just perfection, but Clafin is shockingly ineffective, and while I wanted to love Malone I found her delivery kind of forced) but the returning cast mostly ups their game, especially Banks, who finds layers beneath the makeup.  Harrelson is awful here, completely phoning in each line, but thankfully his awful hair distracted me from his talking.Yes, the cliffhanger basically forces you into actually seeing the final film(s), but this is the kind of film that makes you want to do just that.  In fact, I&#8217;m almost tempted to skip the book and just see the movie; but I&#8217;m pretty sure I won&#8217;t do that.",4,"Oh dear God, does this make me a tween?",1395360000,"03 21,

After my long awaited viewing of The Hunger Games Catching Fire, here is why I stand by my final rating.The Hunger Games Catching Fire brings us back to Katniss Everdeen. Ever since her surprise victory in the 74th games, life for her and her family has changed. Not long after she and Gale(Liam Hemsworth) share an intimate moment, President Snow arrives unexpectedly at her house demanding that she ""convince"" him of her love for Peeta( Josh Hutcherson). Fast forward a victory tour, marriage proposal, and a new gammaker by the name of Plutarch Heavensbee(Phillip Seymour Hoffman) later, Katniss and Peeta are back in the arena.To start out, this movie is pretty lengthy. But even as the credits began to roll, I did not want to leave my seat. Because just as Suzanne Collins got it right when she published Catching Fire back in 2009, it feels like everything wad done right with this movie. With that said, I won't go into detail about what is in the movie from the book and what isn't, but watching this movie felt like reading the novel all over again.No bad acting at all here: great performances by each individual. When I read Catching Fire and was introduced to Finnick Odair, I envisioned guys like Ian Somerhalder, Robert Pattinson, etc. you know, guys other guys hate because girls love his looks? Sam Claffin is Finnick Odair and he works the role like a pro so well in the movie. Jeffrey Wright was awesome as Betee, and I was shocked at how well Jena Malone became the character of Johanna Mason. My personal favorite performance( well, besides everyone else's) came in the form of Phillip Seymour Hoffman as Plutarch Heavensbee.The books are fantastic, and the 2012 film and this one are excellent. I appreciate the concept of having a female as the primary heroine in the story as well. If you have not seen this movie yet, be prepared as you are in for a treat. And as anticipation builds for Mockingjay part 1 and 2, Hunger Games fans and movie fans alike will enjoy this movie whole-heartedly.

1567332,A1K3SFTY71SH6Q,B008JFUS8M,,"[1, 3]","I did not despise the first Hunger Games film.  I instead found it unspectacular through and through, a neither-here-nor-there cinematic experience to be placed in the second or third tier of action and science-fiction films focused on the potential end of the world and/or futuristic totalitarian governments.  With a new director, a larger budget, and an expanded ensemble cast, however, the second film, Catching Fire, represents a vast improvement, and I am now invested in the storyline of the franchise and its bow wielding heroine, played again with convincing angst and agility by Jennifer Lawrence.The past credits of Austrian born American director Francis Lawrence include a long, long list of music videos (for artists such as Green Day, Jay Z, Lady Gaga, and Third Eye Blind) and entertaining, if unmemorable films with a great deal more visual power than depth, including Constantine and I Am Legend.  So he is without a doubt more of a pro gun-for-hire than a genius-in-waiting, but he shines in this particular context, delivering the overcast atmosphere and dawn-of-a-revolution scope required to give this YA adaptation a genuine grit and spirit of involving unease.  With design choices and details both small (blood stains on the snow-white suit of a Capitol soldier) and large (the foreboding, overheated, Joseph Conrad ready jungle environment where the titular murder spectacle unfolds), as well as crisp and graceful camera movements, he and his behind-the-scenes team have assembled a well-designed and grimly beautiful film.The introduction of a few mega-talented character actors, including a charming, nerdy Jeffrey Wright and an icily competent Philip Seymour Hoffman, is another welcome pleasure of the film, though, unfortunately, neither the wooden Josh Hutcherson nor the studly, but largely absent Liam Hemsworth are able to match the magnificent Jennifer Lawrence and truly ignite the film's Twilight style, teen friendly love triangle.  As a bid to tell a story of youthful love and coming-of-age amidst the turbulence of revolution, the Hunger Games saga still comes up a tad short, but at least the revolution itself is now ablaze.",4,A major improvement upon the mediocre first,1385424000,"11 26, 2013",2013,2169,"['did', 'not', 'despise', 'first', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'film', 'instead', 'found', 'unspectacular', 'neither-here-nor-there', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'be', 'placed', 'second', 'third', 'tier', 'action', 'science-fiction', 'films', 'focused', 'potential', 'end', 'world', 'and/or', 'futuristic', 'totalitarian', 'governments', 'new', 'director', 'larger', 'budget', 'expanded', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'however', 'second', 'film', 'Catching', 'Fire', 'vast', 'improvement', 'am', 'now', 'invested', 'storyline', 'franchise', 'bow', 'wielding', 'heroine', 'played', 'again', 'convincing', 'angst', 'agility', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence.The', 'past', 'credits', 'Austrian', 'born', 'American', 'director', 'Francis', 'Lawrence', 'include', 'long', 'long', 'list', 'music', 'videos', 'artists', 'such', 'Green', 'Day', 'Jay', 'Z', 'Lady', 'Gaga', 'Third', 'Eye', 'Blind', 'entertaining', 'unmemorable', 'films', 'great', 'deal', 'more', 'visual', 'power', 'depth', 'including', 'Constantine', 'Am', 'Legend', 'doubt', 'more', 'pro', 'gun-for-hire', 'genius-in-waiting', 'particular', 'context', 'delivering', 'overcast', 'atmosphere', 'dawn-of-a-revolution', 'scope', 'required', 'give', 'YA', 'adaptation', 'genuine', 'grit', 'spirit', 'involving', 'unease', 'design', 'choices', 'details', 'small', 'blood', 'stains', 'snow-white', 'suit', 'Capitol', 'soldier', 'large', 'foreboding', 'overheated', 'Joseph', 'Conrad', 'ready', 'jungle', 'environment', 'where', 'titular', 'murder', 'spectacle', 'unfolds', 'as', 'well', 'crisp', 'graceful', 'camera', 'movements', 'behind-the-scenes', 'team', 'have', 'assembled', 'well-designed', 'grimly', 'beautiful', 'film.The', 'introduction', 'few', 'mega-talented', 'character', 'actors', 'including', 'charming', 'nerdy', 'Jeffrey', 'Wright', 'icily', 'competent', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'welcome', 'pleasure', 'film', 'though', 'unfortunately', 'wooden', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'studly', 'largely', 'absent', 'Liam', 'Hemsworth', 'are', 'able', 'match', 'magnificent', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'truly', 'ignite', 'film', 'Twilight', 'style', 'teen', 'friendly', 'love', 'triangle', 'bid', 'tell', 'story', 'youthful', 'love', 'coming-of-age', 'amidst', 'turbulence', 'revolution', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'saga', 'still', 'up', 'tad', 'short', 'least', 'revolution', 'now', 'ablaze']",N/A

I haven't read the second or third book, and probably won't after seeing this film.What should have been an excellent adventure movie started way too slow, and then lost its gloss with unexplained and physically impossible events. The adventure takes place where the laws of physics exist with futuristic devices.That said, Katniss Everdeen never runs out of arrows, which is reminiscent of the old western movies with six shooters that never ran out of bullets. That could have been addressed with arrows parachuted down from her sponsors.  But it wasn't. Poor screen writing, and why didn't the producers, director, technical advisers, etc., catch that flaw?The fatal flaw was the firing of the arrow and hitting the inside of the dome to foreshadow the final impossible arrow shot. Not possible at that distance. (There is no magic element in this movie. Everything is sci fi, but follows the laws of physics.)(Possible Spoiler) The previous flaw was compounded by the impossibility of an an arrow pulling 30 or 40 pounds of copper cable with it to the top of the dome, to provide an exciting event.  Firing an arrow with a light string attached would actually limit the range of the arrow, because of the drag and mass of the arrow. A copper cable, yet!And, finally, the last few seconds of the movie where an old cliche is used to justify our belief that Katniss, despite all that has happened,  is filled with determination, leading to part 3 and 4 of the story.What should have been a perfect script for a movies grossing hundreds of million bucks, was spoiled for me by the inattention to technical details.I was torn between two or three stars.

1567334,A3O886DD5BZO8O,B008JFUS8M,,"[15, 22]","First off I have to say I don't know how this movie will translate to diskwithout the 3-D. I saw it twice in 3-D at a theater. The first time, therealism in 3-D was just overwhelming. It moves fast. I expected to havenightmares, so I took a pill. No joke. The second time I saw it, a week later,I was able to connect with the characters.And that's the thing, the spiritual beauty of the characters matches theterrifying realism of the context. The catastrophic shock, the shreddedillusion of safety, the suffocating sense of alienation, are a windowinto their souls.""Home, home where I wanted to goHome, home where I wanted to goHome, home where I wanted to go""- Coldplay, ""Clocks"".If you've ever known someone with Meniere's disease, this movie will strikea chord. On earth, if we can't control our movement, it often means we areimmobile, we can't start moving. But in space, it means we can't stop moving.It's like you're dreaming of flying, and then the dream turns into a nightmare,and you just keep smashing into things and getting pounded by them. And youcan't make it stop.I've never known anyone who went catatonic, but Sandra Bullock is all toobelievable as someone whose mind shuts down from sheer disorientation.Outwards, backwards, downwards, into the void forever.I say that because its about 30 seconds out of 90 minutes of Oscar-worthyperformance by both actors in this movie. I really needed the second showto appreciate this. The characters seem like people you know, yet with theeloquence of good actors who are pouring their hearts into their roles.Its said the eyes are the window of the soul, but in this movie, its theirentire faces, their expressions, their words, their body language. All of it.This is a movie with basically just 2 actors, and Sandra Bullock and GeorgeClooney make a superlative team. Their characters don't have a personalrelationship. They have a spiritual relationship. Its easy to miss if you'renot looking for it. Especially George Clooney's character, because withoutthe panic, he's able to feel and express the quiet complexities, the wisdomand compassion. Each actor has half the spectrum, and they fit perfectly.Beyond the actors are the hundreds of other people who helped create this.The best way I've found to learn about how much they contributed, on a4 1/2 year project, is to search the web for interviews. Some critics havecalled Gravity a landmark, a visionary milestone in movie making. WhenAvatar came out on blu-ray it had 8 hours of making-of. I hope Gravity has8 hours of making-of when it comes out on disc.About the musical score, let me just say it evokes this movie. Its one ofthose soundtracks where when you hear the music, the movie plays on theinside of your eyelids, and suddenly it gets hard to speak.About the directing, I have definitely placed Alfonso Cuaron's other movieson my wish-list. He brings out the genius in others.Sometime's, a labor of love turns out to be that person's ruin. Gravity is theexact opposite. Its a labor of love, from a lot of people, that turned out tobe a mind-boggling achievement in every aspect of the film-making art.",5,"Spiritual Beauty, Nightmare Realism in 3-D",1387324800,"12 18, 2013",2013,3128,"['First', 'off', 'have', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'movie', 'will', 'translate', 'diskwithout', '3-D', 'saw', 'twice', '3-D', 'theater', 'first', 'time', 'therealism', '3-D', 'was', 'just', 'overwhelming', 'fast', 'expected', 'havenightmares', 'took', 'pill', 'joke', 'second', 'time', 'saw', 'week', 'later', 'was', 'able', 'connect', 'characters.And', 'thing', 'spiritual', 'beauty', 'characters', 'matches', 'theterrifying', 'realism', 'context', 'catastrophic', 'shock', 'shreddedillusion', 'safety', 'suffocating', 'sense', 'alienation', 'are', 'windowinto', 'souls', 'Home', 'home', 'where', 'wanted', 'goHome', 'home', 'where', 'wanted', 'goHome', 'home', 'where', 'wanted', 'go', 'Coldplay', 'Clocks', '.If', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'known', 'someone', 'Meniere', 'disease', 'movie', 'will', 'strikea', 'chord', 'earth', 'ca', ""n't"", 'control', 'movement', 'often', 'areimmobile', 'ca', ""n't"", 'start', 'moving', 'space', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'moving.It', ""'re"", 'dreaming', 'flying', 'then', 'dream', 'nightmare', 'just', 'keep', 'smashing', 'things', 'getting', 'pounded', 'youca', ""n't"", 'make', 'stop.I', ""'ve"", 'never', 'known', 'anyone', 'who', 'went', 'catatonic', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'toobelievable', 'someone', 'mind', 'down', 'sheer', 'disorientation.Outwards', 'backwards', 'downwards', 'void', 'forever.I', 'say', '30', 'seconds', '90', 'minutes', 'Oscar-worthyperformance', 'actors', 'movie', 'really', 'needed', 'second', 'showto', 'appreciate', 'characters', 'seem', 'people', 'know', 'yet', 'theeloquence', 'good', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'pouring', 'hearts', 'roles.Its', 'said', 'eyes', 'are', 'window', 'soul', 'movie', 'theirentire', 'expressions', 'words', 'body', 'language', 'it.This', 'movie', 'basically', 'just', '2', 'actors', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'GeorgeClooney', 'make', 'superlative', 'team', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'personalrelationship', 'have', 'spiritual', 'relationship', 'easy', 'miss', ""you'renot"", 'looking', 'Especially', 'George', 'Clooney', 'character', 'withoutthe', 'panic', 'able', 'feel', 'express', 'quiet', 'complexities', 'wisdomand', 'compassion', 'actor', 'spectrum', 'fit', 'perfectly.Beyond', 'actors', 'are', 'hundreds', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'helped', 'create', 'this.The', 'best', 'way', ""'ve"", 'found', 'learn', 'how', 'much', 'contributed', 'a4', '1/2', 'year', 'project', 'search', 'web', 'interviews', 'critics', 'havecalled', 'Gravity', 'landmark', 'visionary', 'milestone', 'movie', 'making', 'WhenAvatar', 'came', 'out', 'blu-ray', 'had', '8', 'hours', 'making-of', 'hope', 'Gravity', 'has8', 'hours', 'making-of', 'when', 'out', 'musical', 'score', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'movie', 'one', 'ofthose', 'soundtracks', 'where', 'when', 'hear', 'music', 'movie', 'theinside', 'eyelids', 'suddenly', 'hard', 'speak.About', 'directing', 'have', 'definitely', 'placed', 'Alfonso', 'Cuaron', 'other', 'movieson', 'wish-list', 'out', 'genius', 'others.Sometime', 'labor', 'love', 'out', 'be', 'person', 'ruin', 'Gravity', 'theexact', 'opposite', 'labor', 'love', 'lot', 'people', 'turned', 'out', 'mind-boggling', 'achievement', 'aspect', 'film-making', 'art']",N/A
1567335,AA28P572CT9Y3,B008JFUS8M,,"[1, 5]","Let's say that I love how this film reflects the truth about our society and possible future.  It shows how the athletes, actors and all media/TV personalities are nothing more than paid by the powers that be and must do what they are told or lose their standing, wealth or even their lives.  It shows how the poor celebs and athletes can get taken from the slums to entertain the rulers, but can never really retire unless ordered to.This film, and the previous one have this odd world where homosexuals and transsexuals are running the popular society while those who are not, control it all.  That mirrors real life!  If it becomes THIS explicit in the near future - you can sign me up for an armed rebellion!  This film also shows how FEAR is used to keep people in control - that is the ONLY way that so few can rule so many.  In this film as in real life, the rulers often use fear at will when they feel paranoid and think that they are losing control in order to keep others in line.  They never let the people live in peace or rest easy - as in real life.  It is as if they are in prison and they must be harassed 24/7 - as in real life.  For this depiction of reality - I commend this film.Now, as far as the FILM itself goes - we all now how it would play out before even watching it.  Heroine engages in threat, then faces adversity, then triumphs.  It's the same story in every action film  We all know that the star never dies, so we can predict the ending.  Without giving it away, clearly another film is on it's way and it should play out much like ""Return of the Jedi"" or ""Return of the King.""  It is the same story about tyrannical rulers, then the people wake up and arrest their fears and triumph - until the next batch of maniacs come.At 2:36, this film was about 45 minutes too long!  After the first 45 minutes - I was wondering where they were going and almost too bored to care any longer!  I then broke away and decided to watch the old ""Staying Alive"" film again.  Sad to say, but I found more joy in that film than in this one!  Once I came back to Catching Fire, I was still bored but determined to see it through.I never did like the cinematography of these films, they look like cheap 80's B movies to me.  Nothing looks modern.  The eccentric drag queens looked totally 80's and nothing about this film looked 2013 to me.  The story was not deep, they characters not deep and I never understood the idea about having teams on a last man standing, kill everyone in site competition.  I suppose this was done in order to attempt to have some character interaction with each other, although I would have preferred a ""First Blood"" type of film instead, it would have been more believable.Of course they needed an excuse to put Jennifer Lawrence back in the game and I hope there is not a game in the next one.  Other than the game itself, there is nothing interesting about these films.  It is like the first - Katniss is in a last man standing competition - everyone knows this but for some reason they seem to want to help some people by killing others in order to save them.  They do this knowing that only one can survive, which is kind of pointless.  I guess they needed something to keep it going.  Also, the poisonous fog was funny.  Lawrence is in and out of sleep, then she sees the fog and decides to touch it.  It burns her leaving blisters on her skin.  Then she wakes everyone and they begin to run, outrunning the FAST MOVING fog.  Then they become surrounded by the fog, but the fog pauses, giving them enough time to talk and decide what they need to do, then the fog picks up again!  They could have left that foolishness out of the film.I never read the books - maybe they are more exciting, but I cannot understand how the books and these films are very popular.  The story is not that deep.  I like Harry Potter a lot better and I did not think that story was all that deep.  Maybe I should write one of these types of books to see how much I can make!  I will of course watch the next one just to see it and to see what they do with Hoffman's character since his part was going to be bigger in the next film.  All and all, this was boring!  This sleep therapy film did not stop it from making $500B+ dollars in the US alone.  I think it may still be in the theaters too.

1567338,A276BSDSBYTULH,B008JFUS8M,,"[22, 68]","Let me start this off by saying that I have not read any of The Hunger Games books.  Everything that has happened on screen during the first two in this installment is all new to me, and I have no insight into the source material.  I will also say that I did not like the first one.  It felt very...&#34;PG-Thirteen-y&#34; in every sense.  I thought the story was pretty weak, I found most of the characters unlikable (save for Woody Harrelson), and the action and it's direction were just deplorable - I have no idea how it received the praise that it did.There, I said it.I was asked to go to this at a special early screening and said yes for two reasons - one, I felt that I owed the couple who invited us because I asked them to see Arnold's big screen comeback earlier this year (The Last Stand), which they hated.  Two, I was willing to give this series a second chance, considering there was a new director at the helm and I thought that maybe the second would be better considering the world had already been established and we didn't need much in the way of what I call 'catch-up character development'.1.  The Cast Is...BlahBefore I rip most of the cast, I would like to point out some standout performances.  Jena Malone plays a pretty insane axe-wielding tribute and she is fantastic.  She steals every scene that she's in and is definitely the most interesting tribute in the movie (and yes, I'm including Katniss).  Philip Seymour Hoffman is also fantastic, as usual, and Stanley Tucci is also great.  The rest of the cast may as well have been wet blankets.  Jennifer Lawrence basically displays two emotions the entire film.  Watching Peeta is like staring at one of the  mannequins Kevin McAllister controlled with rope to scare away the Wet Bandits for two and a half hours, and his lack of chemistry with Jennifer Lawrence makes their romance entirely unbelievable...even when it's supposed to be real.  It's eye-roll inducing.  Most of the other tributes receive zero back story and have no personality, so when they show up on screen and take an arrow to the chest, it has absolutely no impact.  They may as well be Foot Soldiers or Putties for the nonchalance with which they are dispatched.  The emotion that should swell in moments like that just were not earned here.2. It's BoringI came into this movie hoping that I would see a bigger, better Games.  I mean, we've got the best of the best competing now, right?  The winning tributes, going after each other?  It's like the All Star Hunger Games.Unfortunately, it takes about an hour and a half of &#34;PTSD/Let's Show You How Bad The World Is...Again&#34; before it gets to the games.  Once it does get to the arena, the action is basically non-existent.  It's mostly just sitting around in the jungle until something the arena throws at them happens - no hand to hand combat at all.  Aside from one battle with animals, I found this really, really boring.  By the way, most of the tributes from the last Hunger Games look like they could take most of the goons found in this sequel.  It's like sending our second tier NBA players to compete in the Olympics...oh wait...3. It's FillerThis movie exists basically as filler between the first and eventual third movie.  It rehashes a lot of what happened in the first one, and ends with an expected cliff-hanger for the third.  I'm okay with movie cliff-hangers.  I mean, the end credits scene in Fast & Furious 6 for example left be breathless leaving the theater.  Unfortunately, this one just left me saying, &#34;That's it?&#34;.  This movie is basically a two and a half hour stretch of something that's normally done within the first three minutes of a futuristic movie via voice over.Even worse, I don't really care what happens to any of these characters, save for Johanna.  Why should I come back for the next movie?4. Forced Jokes/Bad WritingThe jokes...oh, the jokes.  There are some really forced, very poorly executed attempts at humor in this movie.  A few jokes here and there made me chuckle - there's a fantastic elevator scene when we're introduced to Jena Malone that is great - but most fall very, very flat.  When one character is coming back from the brink of death, another character exclaims, &#34;You were dead!  Your heart stopped beating!&#34;...&#34;Well, it's working now.&#34; (audience uproars with laughter).  Maybe I just don't get the type of humor that they were shooting for here, but most of the time, the audience was laughing with things and I couldn't help but sit there wondering what the hell I had just missed.  I didn't expect this movie to be filled with knee-slappers, but I expected the writing to be a bit better than it was.5. The &#34;Columbiana&#34; EndingI have a problem with what I call, The &#34;Columbiana&#34; Ending.  It's a plan by a character that would only work if the character that it's set up for made that odd one in a million choice.  It would be like putting a pack of rabid dogs with a taste for flesh into a van in a parking garage with about fifty cars and hoping that the bad guy not only chooses to drive away from the scene, but also picks that specific van.This story 'ends' with one of those Columbiana choices, and it just doesn't work...at all.  There's a whole lot of explaining to do.  I'm okay with suspending belief to get the most out of a movie, but this one just asks me to be dumb.Needless to say, I did not like this movie.  If I had to pick a few good things out, I'd say that it looks pretty, that some of the cast members (namely Jena Malone) shine, and I'm really glad the 'shaky-cam' is absent from the first movie (the director is much more mature when shooting action).  However, when this series is over, I will probably look back at it the same way that I look at series like Star Wars - I guess I don't 'get it'.  There's nothing that stands out here - the story is mediocre, the acting is merely serviceable, and writing is pretty bad, and the action is boring.  It certainly doesn't seem to deserve the 90% it's got on Rotten Tomatoes right now.  Sometimes I think that critics are afraid to give movies like this an honest score, or they're too connected to the source material.I'm going to go out on a limb and say that if you liked the first one, you'll like this one.  If you didn't, steer clear.Final Score: 2/5",2,I guess I just don't get the love...,1385078400,"11 22, 2013",2013,6341,"['Let', 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'Hunger', 'Games',

I just happened to be bored after work one day and decided I needed a movie to watch. I chose Catching Fire since it was the only movie on the list worth watching (for me at least).I have to say I was blown away by the movie. It really keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time, is filled with surprises and unexpected occurrences, and has downright amazing acting! I swear, the acting was so good that at times you forget your watching a movie with actors/actresses.Overall, the first film was good as I've already stated, but THIS film (Catching Fire) is the one that got me to finally start raving about the Hunger Games.

1567341,A26MJME9IBNETY,B008JFUS8M,,"[3, 5]","*SPOILERS*Where the first movie failed to build a solid foundation for the world of the Hunger Games to stand on, Catching Fire came in to make that foundation more solid. Some of that is, for lack of a better term, accidental. For instance, the fact that Katniss and Peeta are the picture of good health (along with Katniss' family) is now to be expected, so that no longer worked against the movie. District 12 and its inhabitants were more rundown and dilapidated, so the contrast between Katniss and her fellow citizens (other than Gale) was more distinct. All of that was good and gave a more realistic feel to the movie than the last one had.We got a broader view of the world in general and of the Peacekeepers in action, which was way more disturbing than the first movie would have lead us to believe. The second movie made us believe all the things the first movie only told us to believe. It's actually the whole &#34;show vs tell&#34; thing. The first movie tells us the people are oppressed, but Catching Fire shows us.It shows us when Gale is taken and flogged and Katniss almost shot.It shows us when the old man in District 11 is pulled from the crowd and shot in the head.It shows when Katniss and Peeta are offered the puking beverage so that they can continue to participate in the party.And it shows us when Cinna is beaten (to death, I presume) right in front of Katniss after the tube closes on her and all she can do is watch. And scream.The political intrigue, almost absent from The Hunger Games, also elevates Catching Fire. Plutarch Heavensbee is a great character, and I was never quite sure what was going on with him. There was what I thought was happening, but Philip Seymour Hoffman was so good, I spent a lot of time doubting myself. Of course, Hoffman is great, and I was delighted to see him in the movie. Plutarch wasn't the only one playing games, but he was the primary one, and I almost felt sorry for President Snow and his inability to adequately play politics. Snow seemed to know one tactic: &#34;Smash!&#34; Or threaten to smash. Or kill.The acting in Fire was much better than in Games.Lawrence really stepped into the part and made us feel the horror and rage of the things she was going through. Also the lost-ness in parts. She was impressive this time rather than just existing in the role.Woody Harrelson continued to be great as Haymitch.Elizabeth Banks moved beyond her makeup, which was actually rather impressive considering that you couldn't really see her face. The emotion she was able to bring through in relation to how she felt about the injustices that were happening was incredible.Stanley Tucci continued to be awesome.As I already said, Philip Seymour Hoffman was tremendous.Sam Claflin was really good.But the big surprise was Jena Malone. She was great!The greatest success of the movie, though, was that it made me want to read the books. Almost. I'm still not going to read them, because, based on many of the things I've read about it, the movie fixes many of the problems from the first movie and from the books. The focus on the politics seems to be a movie thing not a book thing, and that's the stuff I really liked. So, still, not reading the books, but I'm slightly less set against them now.

1567342,A7DAL9PK7F4M1,B008JFUS8M,,"[3, 6]","This enthralling movie is based on the book of the same name, and follows directly after the first movie, &#8220;The Hunger Games&#8221;. Inspired by the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur, it continues the story of a country named Bread (seriously, Panem is the Latin word for bread), and the world&#8217;s most unfortunate lottery.Not a lot can be said about the plot without giving away too many spoilers. Let&#8217;s summarize by saying that by not dying in the first movie, Katniss and Peeta accidentally started a rebellion against the government. They are forced into an even more cruel version of the Hunger Games, while outside the thunder dome, everyone is playing the same game - with higher stakes. There are moves and countermoves, and nobody is quite sure what anybody else is doing&#8230; or why.The script follows the book pretty closely, and gets all the major plot points right, even though this makes the movie over two hours long (don&#8217;t worry - the last book is being turned into two movies). I was especially happy that they didn&#8217;t soften Katniss up and turn the movie into an actual romance, and that they didn&#8217;t shy away from showing some of the violent scenes (like the first movie did).It was directed by Francis Lawrence, who usually directs music videos. He didn&#8217;t direct &#8220;The Hunger Games&#8221;, but he did direct the Keanu Reeves vampire flick &#8220;Constantine&#8221;, and the Will Smith zombie flick &#8220;I Am Legend&#8221;. Oh, and he got an award for making Lady Gaga&#8217;s &#8220;Bad Romance&#8221; video. And he does a great job with this movie - I&#8217;m glad he&#8217;s already been hired to direct the next two movies. In addition, the acting is great, the script is tight, and the action mixes with politics in the right amounts. Besides these big issues, however, one of the biggest strengths of the film is the way it gets the little details just right - the country of Panem and its cultures seem real. Through dialogue and scenery, you get little glimpses of traditions and events that are unfolding off screen, in other times. You are woven into the fabric of the tale, instead of watching a flat story. It&#8217;s hard to explain this, but it&#8217;s one way I can identify a high-quality movie - and this movie has it in spades.It&#8217;s weird, but another sign of a good movie is how everybody can relate to it. On one hand, Democrats have been claiming that the movie is pretty obviously a criticism of our country&#8217;s widening economic gap, and how social justice doesn&#8217;t usually come from the privileged class.

Following the financial success of the first film, a lot of rough edges and awkward missteps have been ironed out in time for the next act. Most notably improved is the effects work, which had seemed just a bit too much like a video game cutscene. The new arena is convincing and beautiful, the glitz and glamor of The Capitol has been amplified appropriately, and the intricacies of the cast's showy wardrobe (which memorably underwhelmed in the first film) are far better realized. The plot is efficient, if telegraphed and incomplete: its sudden, jolting cliffhanger (which occurs, literally, right in the middle of a sentence) left me flat, even if it is laid out in precisely the same way in the source material. Much of the primary cast spends the duration wrapped up in their own sorrow, quietly brooding over their predicament while the roles of their flashier, more PR-friendly foils have been trimmed down to mere cameos. Such concessions are understandable, as the film does run quite long as it is, but the accompanying shift in tone makes this a very redundant, single-colored ride.

No complaints whatsoever.To be honest, whether it be the first installment, this one, or the next, I will always have doubts regarding how true-to-the-book and how well the directors will be able to bring this original book series to life, but I was blown away by Catching Fire! The Capital, the districts, the reaping were somewhat how I imagined it, and a WHOLE lot better. I would even say that it surpasses the first film by far. The games were more thrilling and had me on the edge of my seat!The movie starts off with an eerie background music, and a scene of Katniss spending time in her district before the victory tour--that usually takes place after the games, and you really get to see how badly the victors are scarred from its experience. Jennifer Lawrence was amazing ... Not much to say  about Josh Hutcherson and his character, Peeta Mellark, but how as equally fantastic they are. The actors, in fact, were all enticing, they really brought life to the characters they portrayed.The training scene was surreal! I litterally had to stop the movie and rewatch it again and again. Like I said, way better than the first film.The plot. Before Catching Fire was out in theaters, there were rumors that it will be split into two parts, I was not happy with that, which is why I am glad the directors and screenwriters decided to make it all in one film. With such a complex story, you would think how impossible it is to cram the events and details all together in a two hour or so project, but it worked! There are people who complain about &#34;this detail was not in there!&#34; or &#34;why did they not add this or that scene?!&#34; Well as I see it, the film has most of the important details and you have to keep in mind that not every single detail will be able to fit into the time frame, directors have to make the story make sense, as well as satisfying the different types of viewers, get over it.Can I watch Catching Fire without watching The Hunger Games and still understand the story? Sure, why not? In this film, there are flashbacks of the previous installment, so even if you did not read the books or watch The Hunger Games, you will still be able to enjoy it. My family did! Though, by watching the the first film, you will be able to better relate with the characters, which makes the events much more emotional and thrilling.Not much more to say.

It has been a while since I've read the books, so I cannot say for sure where things deviated, but nothing really stuck out to me (unlike other book-to-movies where obvious plots/information is missing/changed). The directorial style of F. Lawrence very closely resembled that of G. Roth in the first movie. Sometimes going between directors in trilogies is so noticeable that it seems like a completely different cast/crew/plot style/etc. This loses the flow between movies and it comes off as a disconnected plot.

Still angry over Katniss outsmarting him during the last Hunger Games, President Snow with the help of his new game maker, Plutarch, devises a Quarter Quell where the pool will be chosen from the surviving victors in each district. In District 12, that means Katniss is destined to return to the Games, along with either Peeta or Haymitch. When Peeta volunteers as tribute, it sets the scene for Peeta and Katniss to be placed in danger once again, with Haymitch helping them from the Capitol. Unlike last time, where only some of the tributes were skilled fighters, Katniss and Peeta are facing an entire arena of other tributes whose cunning and skill allowed them to survive the Games. Making allies, something Katniss has always struggled with, will be crucial to coming out alive.Though some of the names and the arena have changed, all the elements that attracted viewers to The Hunger Games movie are present in its sequel. New characters keep things fresh, and it is good to see how the original characters have evolved. Superb acting by all and a gripping story line make this a must see for fans of dystopian fiction.

After I saw the first movie I was so upset that I got my Granddaughters Kindle Reader and bought all three books and read them in 3 days. I was not upset because the movie was bad it is a great movie I own it and must have seen it over 50 times with all the kids but I was upset about how the movie ended and was unaware that it was only the first part of three movies. After I saw the movie The Hunger Games: Catching Fire for the second time I really saw it and it is a fantastic movie I just wish that the Movie Makers would have spent more time let it run longer so they could have included more of the book in the movie. I hope that someday someone will remake the movie to include more of the book in it. The movie was pretty true to the book but so much was left out, I thought and if I would have never have read the books I may not have understood some of the movie. I would have sat through 3 hours of The Hunger Games people were crazy for Harry Potter and those movies ran long so they could add more of the book to those movies. I am not saying the movie is not good, I would buy it again but I am saying that I was disappointed that so much was left out a lot of real important information that was in the book, a lot of interaction between the main corrector's were left out. Well read the books and see the movies and judge for your self's like I said the movie was good but I think it could have been better, it was not the actors it was the content the story that was left out.

The story continues to follow Katniss (and Peeta) as they do a victory tour of Panem. However, things are not as happy as you think might be. Revolution is brewing, and the people in charge want to nip it in the bud. This is solved by having a special Hunger Games for the 75th year. Instead of fresh tributes, they will be reaped from the existing pool of victors. What follows is a fascinating and engaging look at a dystopian society, the battle for survival, etc. This definitely held my interest better than the limpid previous installment. One thing that's immediately noticeable is the change in visual style, and the way they shot the movie. Instead of a lot of handheld and shaky camera, the shots are better composed, wider and more fluid. This is especially helpful in maintaining a sense of place in the arena. I also liked how they gave more time for character development, even for President Snow. They even manage to give most of the new characters their due onscreen as well. Standouts were Philip Seymour Hoffman as Plutarch Heavensbee and Sam Claflin as Finnick O'Dair(?). The only I really don't care for in these movies is the love triangle between Katniss, Gale and Peeta. Twilight already did it, and every movie since has had some variation on it. Overall, this movie is much better than the first one though, and the final two installments will be directed by the same person (Francis Lawrence). They do a better job with the technical aspects, handling of the story and thematic elements and a much better job of building the world of Panem.

Now for the review: Short and Simple, mind you.Jennifer Lawrence has become one of the most well respected actors to ever rise in Hollywood at such a young age (Tom Cruise being the only one that I doubt she'll ever beat in terms of popularity and rightfully so). In this film she adds to her character and it shows that she is not treating this franchise as a money bag and rather very seriously.The late Phillip Seymour Hoffman was excellent as per usual in this film and will be missed in the 4th chapter of this franchise. He also plays a vital role in this film so if your a fan, watch it.The rest of the cast are solid and bring more emotion into a more emotionally driven social themed movie then they really need too, which isn't a complaint but rather a welcome for audiences.The action is quick, yet long, but effective. The biggest and best thing about this films action sequences is they don't seem as rushed as the first, and for the most part the shakey cam &#34;look&#34; is gone, thankfully.Overall if you want some romance, some action all underneath a fairly deeply themed social/political film (although the younger you are the less likely you are to understand the themes depending on how fast you mature, lol) then this is for you.
