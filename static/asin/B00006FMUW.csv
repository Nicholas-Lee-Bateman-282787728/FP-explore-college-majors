We set this up at first in our living room and seeing how much fun  my son had we decided to put this up in his bedroom.  Now he has his own playhouse in his bedroom and we put some of his favorite toys in there and he can spend an hour in there easily. We also have a tunnel that you can place next to the circular opening on the house which makes it even more fun.  The only problem with this playhouse is that I cannot put it away.  I have spent long periods of time trying to put it away but too no avail which is why we have it permanently up in his room.

Even the few small bits of Greek spoken in the film are correct.

Unlike your typical 'chick-flick,' My Big Fat Greek Wedding is a story about culture clash and family values.  Toula, a 30-year old, unmarried Greek woman who is somewhat ashamed of her heritage, meets and falls in love with a young American named Ian.  What follows is a humorous story of their developing love and Toula's struggle to make her family understand.So why only three stars?  Well, the movie is funny, but not THAT funny.  In fact, it's only mildly amusing.  Aside from the Windex joke (which was very cool), there is little to laugh at in this movie.  And, as far as the love story goes, there is hardly any chemistry between Toula and Ian.  In fact, the love story is horribly underdeveloped.Lots of people think this movie is downright hilarious, so it's worth your time to check it out.

You know there's going to be a wedding at the end of the movie. The movie plays it safe, and is rated PG. The cast is a bunch of unknowns, unless you recognise that one of the cousins was the backing dancer to Justin Timberlake in N*Sync, and her brother was previously in Friends. (Louis Mandylor played ""Carl"" in episode: ""The One with Unagi"" in series 6 - I will spot these people.) There's a brief introduction to the character of Toula Portokalos, with a voice over. You see throughout school, as this dumpy little girl, before she finally grew up. And boy, Nia Vardalos can do ugly in this movie like Sandra Bullock does ugly in Miss Congeniality!However, this film is OK, to watch on a boring Sunday afternoon. But it's too short. Nia Vardalos does end up looking quite pretty, although what was the deal with John Corbett? It's called a haircut. Get one.The whole family situation was absolutely hilarious. That was the best bit about the movie, from the Mum starting to give her 30-year-old daughter a pep talk about what happens on your wedding night; the aunt (?) asking why Toula's future husband doesn't eat meat, and then prepares lamb instead; and the drunk parents-in-law. There is more funny things about the family, and more stuff could have been developed, but sadly, they were pushed to the side, in favour of lots of wedding preparation.What was strange was that the husband & wife team of Rita Wilson & Tom Hanks actually produce this movie. Rita Wilson, saw the play and recommended that her husband produce a movie version. In an interview with the German magazine ""Cinema"", Nia Vardalos mentioned, that she hung up when Hanks called, because she didn't believe it was really him.On the weekend of October 4-6, 2002, this film surpassed The Blair Witch Project as the highest-grossing independent film of all time, until March 2004, when it was surpassed by The Passion of the Christ. Also, in the fall of 2002 it surpassed Dances with Wolves as the highest grossing movie never to have hit number one at the box office.I wouldn't say this was a good date movie, as one other reviewer said - chances are, that you'd be so bored once the movie was over, you wouldn't want to do anything else. And the guy you took would probably be sound asleep. And do you really want to scare your date into thinking you have a massive family like that?I expected to like this movie, since it's a rom-com after all. However, it was just OK for me, to quote Randy Jackson (American Idol.) It was nothing special, and all these people who make a fuss over it?

However it did, and I really enjoyed this movie. Nia Vardalos plays Toula, who at first is a frumpy woman you wouldn't expect anyone to take a second look at. Helping run her families restaurant. In comes Ian (played by John Corbett), a man she is instantly attracted to. Toula longs to go back to college, and she makes her dreams of something more come true, and goes to college to learn about computers, and decides to work in a travel agency. She falls for Ian almost instantly, but is worried what her Greek family will think, since she is supposed to marry Greek, and continue the tradition. Her family is loud and outrageous, and an overall joy to watch. With a little resistance from the father, they eventually marry and its a fairytale ending.

714420,A35UNON2GI8C0R,B00006FMUW,,"[1, 3]","We know what's going to happen in this ugly duckling tale; heck, the title of the film is indicative of what's to come. Like all romantic-comedies, the goal, since it's difficult to get away from stock characters which riddle these type of films, is to make the journey worthwhile.The charm of ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" is taking the formula with which we're so accustomed and spinning it into a culture class conflict, Greek-style. It's been done before with Italian-, Hispanic- and African-Americans. So why not Greek-Americans?But the story and characters here, while cliche, are quite fun. This film makes no pretense of being anything but entertaining in a middle- to low-brow way, and I don't mean that negatively, but in the sense of appealing to what's familiar, without inflicting grossness or cheap jokes found in more common ""R"" rated fare.It was plenty fun since after the first reel, the stage was set with respect to expectations.So if you're looking for a challenging think piece in the romantic comedy genre, skip this and keep moving. If you're looking for formula, well executed with a twist, loaded with engaging, appealing and familiar character actors, and have a high tolerance for the familiar, accepting the premise set forth from first image to last, then watch this. I've seen a ton of films, from high art to low, from Scorcese to the foreign, from Spielberg to Disney to the Farrellly Brothers. And this film is a fine enough accomplishment for what it set out to do; it is inoffensive and has enough edge and charm to feel ""new.""No one is claiming greatness here. Yet ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" does have an inescapable, historic quality to it if for no other reason than the mountains climbed to get it into the public discussion of films. Screenwriter-actress Nia Vardalos has pulled off a minor miracle, hence deserving as much credit as Sylvestor Stallone, who, in 1975, felt compelled to play the lead in his own sentimental screenplay, ""Rocky,"" which went on, against all odds, to win the Best Picture Oscar of 1976. No Best Picture prospects are in order for Vardalos, but she's just ""notched"" herself into the film history books, no small feat. She and her high-profile producers (which included Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson) took a low-risk gamble and scored big. Like ""Rocky,"" not every film should have to cost $80 million to reach an audience. I make this comparison because both films had shoestring budgets and exceeded expectations in a big-time way.As far as complaints about not meeting the ""hype,"" I'd ignore such talk. This film was a success not because of a finely-tuned marketing campaign. It was a success because of the best measure of all -- good word-of-mouth from average people on the street -- you know, like your next door neighbor. As much as I read many critics in most magazines, I trust most word-of-mouth recommendations.

714423,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B00006FMUW,,"[1, 4]","When every second person you meet asks you if you have seen a movie, you start to really wish they would release the movie on DVD sooner.Finally I was able to view a movie everyone I know has been telling me to see. EVEN people I don't know, like those in the line at the grocery store. Yes.The absolute enthusiasm is like nothing I've seen in a long time. I mean, strangers are asking me if I've seen this movie.Firstly, I think this movie is very popular because it presents a woman who is not a ""pencil-thin waif"" in the role of a romantic. She really is a woman we can all relate to.  She has hips, she breaks out AND everyone in her family wants to know when she is going to get married and have kids. Hello, hello, hello reality. This is REAL.Any woman who has planned a wedding and actually gone through with it without going half insane, will completely relate to Toula. No matter her age. This movie has those universal themes in it all woman can relate to. And then we have Ian (John Corbett) who could turn any woman into a complete mute in his presence. Which is what happens when Toula and Ian first meet.Then, to top this all off. Ian not only does everything he can to please Toula, he says everything she NEEDS to hear. The fact is, she doesn't have to ask. This man really, really loves Toula. He is a woman's most romantic fantasy.So, if woman are running up to you asking you why you haven't seen this movie or bought your own copy, that is my take on WHY.This is one of those sweet and almost innocent movies that doesn't focus on sex scenes and all you will see is some kissing and a brief scene that is rather cute and funny when Toula ""attacks"" Ian. This movie gets right to the heart of the matter and deals with romance, family situations and love.The plot is relatively simple because basically this is a very short and relatively uncomplicated courtship. This is a story told by Toula and therefore it takes on a ""diary"" feel.I thought Toula changed a bit too fast from ""mousy-hide-behind-counter"" girl to ""I'm-so-here"" girl (scenes got cut??), but apart from that, Nia Vardalos is a very likeable actress who captured the innocence of Toula. I'm not sure how Ian turned out to be quite so wonderful with the types of parents they portray. I'd like to see parents portrayed in a different way than is recently acceptable. The ""we-are-so-not-here-and-stare-into-space"" parents are so not fun to watch onscreen.How would a wonderful man like Ian be produced by ""those"" two parents? Sorry, not going to happen in my mind. I think they made his parents far too insecure and unintelligent. I'm sorry to say but the Greek family was not ""that"" different than any other family. It was like Ian's family had never left the house or met anyone of another culture in our multicultural society.I think I laughed three or four times (where they keep making poor Ian say things in Greek he has no idea he is saying), but this was not a ROFLOL funny type movie. There are some serious issues they address well and other's they ignore.I mean, would you not want to first study up on a certain religion before being baptized into a completely new religion?It was like watching a ""dating show"" in some way and like ""remembering"" your own wedding in other ways.Hey, even if this was overhyped, it was worth watching to see John Corbett in a role of a completely romantic guy.Listen up guys out there. This is what will drive a woman wild. lolWhat woman would NOT DIE to have a man ask her father if he could ask her out. Let alone make an effort to fit into her family life and adjust to a completely new religion.They are onto something here, but this movie should have had a more complicated plot, not to mention a longer period of time between ""mousy"" to ""I'm-so-here"" girl.Overall, I loved it and can see why alomst everyone does. If movies are at least moving in this direction there may be some hope for 2003-2004. Just wondering: ""Did sales for Windex triple?""They should have really played up the ""Greek Food"" aspects in this movie. They barely show you anything and had a great opportunity to promote Greek food, which is some of the most delicious food I've ever tasted.I grew up with Greek friends and my parents learned how to make lamb on the spit and let me tell you, it is delicious beyond all expectations. Also, pass the Baklava, please. It does seem Ian loves Greek food, which is what gives us a hint at the start that he will fit in perfectly. Plus, he has such a laid back ""I'm-so-in control-of-this-situation"" attitude. It is just divine.Basic Plot:Girl sees BoyBoy sees Girl but she is mousy.Girl becomes goddess of desire and intellectual princess of travel.Man sees Girl and remembers her for inner charm.Girl tries to hide from Boy knowing family will never approve of dashing hunk who is not Greek.Boy takes all in stride and conquers all in path on way to sweeping girl off feet.Girl is stunned, amazed and impressed and how could she not be?If you are a hopeless romantic, you will probably love it.If your pragmatic nature has gotten a hold of you, you probably won't.~The Rebecca Review",5,Are you pragmatic or romantic?

714425,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,B00006FMUW,,"[1, 6]","I just don't understand it.  Why was this, a film about a mousy 30-something Greek woman getting a Pygmalion makeover and finding the man of her dreams, then going through the cacophony of planning a wedding with her colossal nuclear family, such a critical and box-office masterstroke?  Why was a script written by the film's star, lacking in plot and containing banal dialogue, hailed as one of the better comedies of 2002?  Why does everyone think that this movie is so great?I'll tell you why - HYPE.  Movies like ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" have lived off this wondrous distortion of facts since the beginning of time and the reason for their continued success is that moviegoers never bother to question the gushing quotes of such renowned publications as Newsweek, People and the Los Angeles/New York Times.  Simply put, to describe ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" as ""hilarious"", ""brilliant"" or otherwise ""spectacular"" is RUBBISH.  This movie is schmaltzy, cringe-inducing and uninspired.  1990's ""Father of the Bride"" and ""Muriel's Wedding"" are a riot compared to this.Here's the mundane storyline: Toula Portokalos (Vardalos) is a woman on the precipice of middle-age whose parents consistently give her grief about being an old maid - all they've wanted and planned for her since she was a child was to get married as soon as she came of age.  What makes things worse for her is that her older sister Athena has been married for nearly a decade, has three children and is pregnant with her fourth.  Toula is exhausted by the henpecking of her female relatives to find a husband and by her authoritative, sexist father Gus (Constantine) - he is against all things that elevate women above men, particularly regarding employment and higher education.Problems arise when Toula finally meets Mr. Right, a college professor named Ian Miller (Corbett) whose background radically differs from hers.  All spouses within the Portokalos family are of Greek lineage and Ian's opposing ancestry causes dissension with Toula's parents, particularly Gus.  So Ian, being the nice guy that he is, decides to get baptized in a Greek Orthodox church so he can obtain a mandated marriage to Toula and make peace with her folks.  The movie ends with the extravagant ceremony and reception, complete with an extremely generous wedding gift from Gus to the newlyweds that aims to wrench the heartstrings of its viewers.There - I've told you the whole story, minus a few details.  I'll also tell you that the script, lauded as ""hilarious"", is far from it.  It isn't smart humor, it isn't slapstick, it isn't wry - it's totally uninspired and will leave many people scratching their noggins in utmost bewilderment.  Where is the incredible mirth that the critics suggested?  Those liars - I should've rented ""There's Something About Mary"" or ""Dumb and Dumber"" and gotten my money's worth. Families with a Greek lineage may enjoy the many inside quips, but being German-Irish myself, the jokes were lost on me.Both Tom Hanks and wife Rita Wilson backed this project by serving as producers, giving the unknown Vardalos a chance to take her one-woman stage show to the mainstream.  I'm beginning to think the Hanks were the ONLY reason this film was pushed in the limelight.Bottom line: ""Cutesy"" and ""heartwarming"" would be the fairest ways to describe ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"".

But, this was a good time despite their weaker points.We're rooting for the underdog in this movie, in this case Toula, a frumpy, somewhat nerdy Greek woman who is 30 years old and still living at home with her family.  She is unhappy with the stagnation around her.  She has a big, loud family of eccentric characters and everyone's Greek.  She is also at age 30 considered to be an old maid, which she is about to break down and accept with much resignation.  Then, one day, Chris the DJ from Northern Exposure walks in (probably one of the most gorgeous things ever created by the gods if there ever was one) and she decides to make herself more attractive to catch his attention.  Besides dressing up and caring more for her appearence, she decides to go for an education as well.  Her credentials land her in a better job than waitressing, and there is where Chris the DJ reenters the picture, and their love begins.  This is a non-Greek, which her father will be outraged about as it has been his dream that she would marry another virial Greek testosterone machine and make Greek babies.  Soon the situation comes together, Dad accepts the plain white bread man, and the two live happily ever after.It was a cute story, no doubt about that, but it was a little too cute.  Here they are playing up on the typical Cinderella story - the dowdy frump girl who wishes for her prince, overcoming family evils, and achieving her happiness.  They are also bringing in the big obnoxious ethnic aspects of her loud, eccentric family, which has been done before.  Probably Aunt Voola was the funniest of them all, as she was the absolute oddest, and Grandma was pretty funny all dressed in black running away from the Turks.  But, that's where the eccentric character study ended and the rest was just an amusing sitcom type situation.

Why they are attracted to each other is anybody's guess.  Everytime Toula talked I was surprised to hear her voice,  especially when I could actually understand what she was saying. Ian's character was irritatingly bland, with no opinions or flavor.  He never once stood up for anything throughout the entire film.  I also found the fact that he was willing to be baptized into a religion he knew nothing about, with apparently no study or preparation absolutely unbelieveable.All these jokes have been told before, all the situations have been played out so many times - the out-of-control in-laws, the old-world traditions v.s. new world , the uptight WASPs, the tacky wedding clothes, the bewildered, overwhelmed bride finally reallizing how much she loves her gosh-darn crazy family.I really wanted to like this film, but after enduring the overdone hairdos, the horrible accents, the stereotypically closed-minded Dad (do people really live like this anymore?), and the uninteresting one-dimensional ""characters"", I can only hope there won't be a Big Fat Greek Sequel.",1,My big fat Greek disappointment,1045267200,"02 15, 2003",2003,1505,"['husband', 'were', 'so', 'excited', 'see', 'movie', 'hearing', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'things', 'How', 'duped', 'were', 'was', 'such', 'disapointment.First', 'film', 'worst', 'ethnic', 'stereotyping', 'are', 'characters', 'film', 'only', 'chemistry', 'two', 'culture-crossed', 'lovers', 'hardly', 'even', 'see', 'having', 'true', 'conversation', 'more', 'four', 'five', 'sentences', 'Why', 'are', 'attracted', 'other', 'anybody', 'guess', 'Everytime', 'Toula', 'talked', 'was', 'surprised', 'hear', 'voice', 'especially', 'when', 'could', 'actually', 'understand', 'what', 'was', 'saying', 'Ian', 'character', 'was', 'irritatingly', 'bland', 'opinions', 'flavor', 'never', 'once', 'stood', 'up', 'anything', 'entire', 'film', 'also', 'found', 'fact', 'was', 'willing', 'be', 'baptized', 'religion', 'knew', 'nothing', 'apparently', 'study', 'preparation', 'absolutely', 'unbelieveable.All', 'jokes', 'have', 'been', 'told', 'situations', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'out', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'out-of-control', 'in-laws', 'old-world', 'traditions', 'v.s', 'new', 'world', 'uptight', 'WASPs', 'tacky', 'wedding', 'clothes', 'bewildered', 'overwhelmed', 'finally', 'reallizing', 'how', 'much', 'gosh-darn', 'crazy', 'family.I', 'really', 'wanted', 'like', 'film', 'enduring', 'overdone', 'hairdos', 'horrible', 'accents', 'stereotypically', 'closed-minded', 'Dad', 'do', 'people', 'really', 'live', 'anymore', 'uninteresting', 'one-dimensional', 'characters', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'there', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'Sequel']",N/A

714444,A1M9DQDGE07Q0U,B00006FMUW,,"[5, 10]","I'm at a loss to explain why ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" got the Oscar nod for best screenplay. It's the story of an ugly duckling, Toula Portocalas (Nia Vardalos) who (stop me if you've heard this one before) turns into a beautiful swan by the end. This transformation is made possible by the love and respect of Toula's floppy-eared fianc&eacute;e cum groom, Ian Miller (John Corbett). Though both of Toula's parents, Gus (Michael Constantine) and Maria (Lainie Kazan), are initially opposed to the marriage they eventually they warm up to the idea that their daughter loves a Catholic.Written by Vardalos, who clearly thought this was some sort of homage to her middle European heritage, the plot is excessively burdened with middle-European clich&eacute;s that get overplayed, tapping into the bias that all Greeks are warm-hearted simpletons and all outsiders are clearly cold fish. Perhaps a more fitting title would have been, ""My Big Fat Greek Stereotype"". Really, there are maybe four instances in the entire film where I found myself genuinely smiling. The rest of the jokes fall somewhere between middle of the road and ""oh God, I can't believe they did that!"" Clearly, this was a movie written for and marketed to a very specific audience, and in so far as that goes, ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" hit its target right on the money and all the way through to a failed television spin off and lucrative Hollywood career for its star. Never has so little originality been stretched such a long, long way. But this is not a great comedy or even a mediocre one. It's just big and fat.At least there's some redemption to be found in the widescreen transfer. Anamorphically enhanced, colors are rich, bold and well balanced. Contrast levels are admirably presented with a remarkable amount of fine detail present, while blacks are both solid and deep. Edge enhancement is present but is kept to a bare minimum. Pixelization and shimmering crop up now and then, but here too, they are nothing to quibble about.

714454,ABQPBY4VNK40Y,B00006FMUW,,"[8, 21]","My Big Fat Greek Wedding should have been titled My Big Fat Boring Movie. Lacking any creativity, laughs, style or fun, Wedding stands apart from the rest of the year's films as 2002's major ode to mediocrity. Following a stale plot device, a typical wallflower from a Greek family (a family filled with every wornout clich&eacute; imaginable) comes into her own, woos a WASP and then tries to commingle the oh-so-different Greek family and her beau's stodgy upbringing. Think Moonstruck but without good writing, acting, directing, pacing or storytelling.Star, writer and all around listless &quot;actress&quot; Nia Vardalos transformed her play of the same concept into a film at the urging of the king of banality and his wife, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Tom Hanks. It shouldn't come as a shock that the Hanks' brood would help push something this predictable and unoriginal on the public. What is amazing is that more critics haven't come forward to ask why people still make movies with such witless gags (oozo makes people drunk, those kooky Greeks cooking a goat on the lawn). How about stereotypical characters galore? The WASP parents are naturally stiff and look like an advertisement for the Republican Party. The Greeks? Oh dad loves his little girl, mistrusts non-Greeks, likes to have a good party and naturally doesn't believe women should be educated. Mom? Oh she runs the family business cleverly manipulating her boorish husband. How about a wacky Greek grandma always looking for Turks? Got it. Really, every possible stereotype and old-hat character design pops up. Devoid of clever plotting, dialogue or fully formed characters, Vardalos' writing talent remains as much as mystery as the film's green light for production.Vardalos acting consists of make up to get her to appear frumpy and then more makeup to make us believe she might be mildly attractive. Impressive, if one never asked her to react or emote. But the script demands it and Vardalos doesn't come through in the least. John Corbett appears as the boyfriend and he's got as little charisma now as he did 10 years ago on the far too quirky &quot;Northern Exposure.&quot; The rest of the cast is as forgettable as the leads and the all-too-familiar white guy hooking up with nutty foreigners plotting.My Big Fat Greek Wedding might have been entertaining had the filmmakers bothered to create anything original, engaging or clever. Instead we get a Greek remake of the Salma Hayek/Matthew Perry stinker Fools Rush In.

When she hits 30 she decides to do something about it.  So she does something about her appearance, gets some education, and gets a new job.  That's when she meets Ian Miller (John Corbett (I)).  They hit it off from the beginning and then have to negotiate how to tell Toula's family and get her family to accept Ian.My Comments:I actually saw one episode of the TV series before I watched the movie and was worried it was going to be horrible.  But I was pleasantly surprised.  In the TV series, Nia had no comic presentation.  In the movie, most everyone was very good.  The story was fun, though not particularly surprising.  They meet, fall in love, and get married, no twists, no surprises.  The couple loves each other and don't ever seem to fight.  Perhaps it is a bit too surreal, but the Portokalos family makes up for the ordinary by being a bit extraordinary.Overall, the movie isn't laugh out loud funny, but it has its moments.  And what it lacks in humor it does make up in being touching in showing how loving and accepting families can be.  Admittedly the 'Greekness' was a bit over the top and some times people can be a little embarrassed of their family/heritage, but it was still entertaining.

Time went by, and here in Colombia movies usually only come if they are succesful or if they have big names in the cover, which is pathetic, but I can't do anything about it. Anyway, I still saw thee trailer in E! and I decided to check the status of it in the box-office nad with critics, and I was puzzled to see that it was doing very good business and had a considerable number of good reviews, then I found out in t.v that Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson were producers, and I said to myself, well this is something to check out. When it finaly came here, it had already beaten Signs in the box-office and with a huge give or take [money amount], I took my mom to see it, she loves silly romance movies and so I said, if it's bad, at lest she will like it. The film started and I found it still to my surprise, amazing and amazingly funny, It got me ever since Michael Constantine says to Nia ""You look....old"". This is one of the best romantic comedies of all times. This may be because is soo different, most of the previous romantic comedies we had a big bucks leading lady(lets say Julia Roberts) and a convinient and sappy film, but this one, it managed to do a lot with very little. This movie is the proof that luck does exist, because from an unknown stand-up girl, Nia Vardalos became a girl with a [money amount] movie, an Oscar nomination, a Golden Globe nomination and a SAG nomination in best ensemble, plus a new t.v hit which I personaly like.And the film, well it's great, the situations are realistic, and according to the Greek comunity, true to their legacy, and just plain funny. And personaly, Nia is lovely, she has that Greek exotic quality that is so appealing. And the rest of the cast is just fantastic. I also found the soundtrack quite charming. I hope this film proves to all those people that hate Hollywood because they think is a place where little people don't have a chance. This film and all it did proves them wrong. It shows that talent and just a tiny bit of luck or divine intervention, like having Rita Wilson seeing the show of Nia, is enough for making it. I look forward for projects by Nia Vardalos, let's hope for our sake she keeps up her quality in her works, it would be really bad to see here do dull and sappy films trying to get more juice out of the concept of a big fat greek family, the t.v show is enough, let's hope she stars doing different things, is nice when actors are diverse, ... She won our hearts with this film. I highly recomend this film, it's very good when you are feeling droopy, it is very good when you  just want to laugh. Thank good there are still fun and smart comedies, I am getting sick with the vulgar comedies that do every and any revolting just to see if people can laugh, American Pie epitomizes this, dumb and [dumber] films desperate for a laugh.

714466,A15S44J4NHU4LS,B00006FMUW,"Alvin Tanhehco ""kerki""","[6, 10]","After several weeks of this film lingering within the top 10, and a lot of good buzz surrounding it I finally had to see it.  And I was rewarded for my curiosity.The movie starts with Toula, a 30 year old Greek girl, telling the audience about the three main responsibilities of Greek women: 1) marry a Greek man, 2) have Greek children, and 3) cook Greek food for everyone in the family.  ...  The film also takes us through the preparations leading up to the wedding, and the wedding itself followed by the reception.There are many small details that set this film apart from others, the honesty of the characters, the reality of Greek culture and traditions, and the simplicity of a timeless story.Nia Verdalos (who plays Toula) wrote the screenplay based on her stand-up comedy show.  When Rita Wilson (also Greek) saw it, she quickly convinced Tom Hanks to watch it as well.  He saw it, loved it, then decided to produce a movie out of it.  It cost a meekly ($$$) to make but estimates have it racking up close to ($$$)  by the time it hits videos.  It just goes to show, a good story is worth much much more than fancy special effects and big-namecelebrities.  (By the way, N'Sync's Joey Fatone plays a small part as Cousin Angelo.  If you ask me, he looks and sounds more Italian than Greek.  He'll also be one of the cast member's of Rent on Broadway.)I think just about anyone can relate to this movie.  Whether you're Greek or not, you'll find something in this film to rave about.  I guarantee you will not be dissappointed.LEAP rating (each out of 5):============================L (Language) - 4.5 (wonderfully human story, relatable glimpse into Greek life)E (Erotica) - 0 (n/a)A (Action) - 0 (n/a)P (Plot) - 3 ...",5,Put some Windex on it...,1031443200,"09 8, 2002",2002,1727,"['several', 'weeks', 'film', 'lingering', 'top', '10', 'lot', 'good', 'buzz', 'surrounding', 'finally', 'had', 'see', 'was', 'rewarded', 'curiosity.The', 'movie', 'Toula', '30', 'year', 'old', 'Greek', 'girl', 'telling', 'audience', 'three', 'main', 'responsibilities', 'Greek', 'women', '1', 'marry', 'Greek', 'man', '2', 'have', 'Greek', 'children', '3', 'cook', 'Greek', 'food', 'everyone', 'family', 'film', 'also', 'preparations', 'leading', 'up', 'wedding', 'wedding', 'followed', 'reception.There', 'are', 'many', 'small', 'details', 'set', 'film', 'apart', 'others', 'honesty', 'characters', 'reality', 'Greek', 'culture', 'traditions', 'simplicity', 'timeless', 'story.Nia', 'Verdalos', 'who', 'Toula', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'based', 'stand-up', 'comedy', 'show', 'When', 'Rita', 'Wilson', 'also', 'Greek', 'saw', 'quickly', 'convinced', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'watch', 'as', 'well', 'saw', 'loved', 'then', 'decided', 'produce', 'movie', 'cost', 'meekly', 'make', 'estimates', 'have', 'racking', 'up', 'close', 'time', 'videos', 'just', 'show', 'good', 'story', 'worth', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'fancy', 'special', 'effects', 'big-namecelebrities', 'way', ""N'Sync"", 'Joey', 'Fatone', 'small', 'part', 'Cousin', 'Angelo', 'ask', 'more', 'Italian', 'Greek', ""'ll"", 'also', 'be', 'one', 'cast', 'member', 'Rent', 'Broadway', 'think', 'just', 'anyone', 'can', 'relate', 'movie', ""'re"", 'Greek', 'not', ""'ll"", 'find', 'something', 'film', 'rave', 'guarantee', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'dissappointed.LEAP', 'rating', '5', '============================L', 'Language', '4.5', 'wonderfully', 'human', 'story', 'relatable', 'glimpse', 'Greek', 'life', 'E', 'Erotica', '0', 'n/a', 'A', 'Action', '0', 'n/a', 'P', 'Plot', '3']",N/A

714473,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00006FMUW,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","`My Big Fat Greek Wedding' is not necessarily `laugh-out-loud' funny but it is funny.  I think that all the hype surrounding this film killed it for me the first time I saw it.  It just was not the laugh-riot I was promised.  Now, a few years later, I watched it again for the second time with my wife (one of the ones who over-hyped the film when it was released).  With the hype dead and my initial response to the film a vague memory I can honestly say that the second time around was much more rewarding.  `My Big Fat Greek Wedding' is sweet and sentimental and leaves the viewer with that warm and fuzzy feeling we don't get much anymore.  It just feels right from start to finish.  It's not like it's anything all that `new' to the genre.  Think `Guess Who's Coming to Dinner' with Greeks and Jews.  Despite the `familiarity' it still feels refreshing because it's not your typical comedy.  It's a little more inviting than the average comedy.This feeling of warm invitation is due to the films star (and author) Nia Vardalos, the most unlikely of romantic leads.  I think that's another draw to this film is that the stars look and act like real people (okay, they may act a little stranger than `real' people, but that's half the fun) as apposed to looking like Jessica Alba.  Vardalos plays Toula Portokalos, a thirty-something Greek girl who is still single, slightly overweight and gawky.  In the eyes of her family she's somewhat of a failure.  Toula decides that she is finally going to take her life into her own hands instead of living the life her father has set before her.  That is when she meets Ian, a handsome Jewish man that is everything she's ever dreamed of and everything her family would never condone.Nia Vardalos captures the downtrodden Toula perfectly, drawing the audience into her troubles, always remaining that sweet girl we want to see end up happy.  John Corbett is effective as Ian, handsome and genuine.  We understand why Toula loves him so much.  Lainie Kazan plays Toula's mother with such genuine warmth she'll have you wishing that she were your mother, and Michael Constantine does a great job of making his eccentric and overbearing father come across understandable and likable.  To me though, and just about every other person I speak to, the standout here is non other than Andrea Martin who steals the show with her comedic timing.  Her whole `twin' scene makes this movie worthy of your DVD library.`My Big Fat Greek Wedding' is truly a lovely film.  If you were anything like me and expected so much that you were disappointed the first go around I urge you to give this one another try.  Its warmth and genuine free spirit make `My Big Fat Greek Wedding' not the funniest comedy out there but one of the most likable.",4,One big fat good time...

714474,A1IKOYZVFHO1XP,B00006FMUW,andy8047,"[2, 4]","Canadian-Greek comic actress Nia Vardalos delivers a a wonderful performance to her personally scripted MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING. This was inspired by her real-life wedding. I saw this movie in a theatre on Thanksgiving Day 2002 and really enjoyed it. Joey Fatone of the singing group N'Sync appears in the film as Angelo. I bought this VHS tape for my mom shortly after its release and gave it to her for her birthday in June. Vardalos' character Toula has been often pressured by her father since she was 15 years old to get married and 15 years later,she finally did. Toula met Ian Miller,portrayed by John Corbett,star of HBO's Sex and the City,at the travel agency which she at one point in the film found employment. After a whirlwind courtship,they married. Miller is an American man. Toula is first seen as a nerdy plain Jane which was why she couldn't fall in love. So later she trashes the glasses and installs contact lenses in her eyes. She beautifully styles her hair and applies make-up,including lipstick. If she hadn't done those things,Ian wouldn't have fallen in love with Toula. But then again,Ian could have fallen for her because of her inner beauty. Lainie Kazan and Michael Constantine are Vardalos' parents in the film. Gia Carides plays Vardalos' sister. After the wedding,we see Toula and Ian about five years later,with their son beginning kindergarten. Vardalos' real-life husband is Ian Gomez who is Canadian-Hispanic. They met while they were cast members on Second City TV in their native Canada. This film inspired the short-lived CBS sitcom ""My Big Fat Greek Life"" which only lasted about two months and precisely six episodes according to tvtome.com. Kazan,Constantine and Carides were all part of the TV cast. There were different characters though. Vardalos' TV character is Nia Portakolos with Steven Eckholdt playing her husband. There were also flashbacks in every episode where we see Nia as a child and her younger-looking mom and dad.

714481,A1T84UA62FPGTW,B00006FMUW,Ashley Judd,"[12, 17]","There's lots of drama and comedy in this movie, said to be more or less autobiographic of its lead actress, Nia Vardalos. The character she plays in the movie is named Toula. She comes from a very traditional Greek-American family, her father being especially firmly rooted in Greek ways. He's subject to going bonkers at the thought of his daughter not marrying a Greek person. But Toula is a daughter with much more of a mind of her own than her father expects. She first wants to pursue an education and make a life for herself other than as a waitress in the family restaurant. Such goals constitute a family crisis in the eyes of some of her family, but especially her father. But she pursues her goals, despite her father's crisis, and along the way she meets and falls in love with a guy after all. As fate would have -- yes, you guessed it, he isn't Greek. Getting her family to accept the idea of her marrying him will occupy much of the plot. A lot of the story is presumably realistic but with a good dose of laughter. Maybe a sort of comic licence justifies some departure from absolute realism. One thing I had trouble finding believable is how Toula starts out in an awkward, sometimes nearly catatonic, state, then suddenly transforms to one with vivacious grace on finding that the guy of her affections is attracted to her too. Once that happens, what follows is a touching and humorous insight into the process of family acceptance and the &quot;culture shock&quot; in bringing the bride's and groom's families together, the latter being mainfested especially poignantly in the groom's &quot;waspish&quot; parents. The bride and groom decide her family (and especially her father, of course) just couldn't bear being deprived of the full-scale big traditional Greek wedding for their daughter. That means being maried in the Greek Orthodox Church, which in turn means the groom must become a member thereof. His baptism into the church then becomes a key episode in the movie. So while the movie is rich in insight into the clash of cultures brought on by this union of two people of different backgrounds, being baptised into a new church is a religious event, and that is what the movie seems to skip over lightly. No insight seems to be given into what new religious outlooks the groom is buying into by joining a church new to him. Seems a vital part of what one would be concerned with in joining a new church, in order to be married there, or for any other reason. But the movie doesn't seem to treat that as relevant. The new things that the groom and his family become acquainted with include cuisine and drink, importance of extended family in the Greek community, and children's attendance at Greek school. The latter is not shown in the movie to have a specifically religious dimension; about the only characteistic of Greek school portrayed is study of the Greek language. Seems the religious dimension would be a major concern to anyone considering joining a new church in order to marry there. But the movie strictly seems to regard that as no big deal. Is that because the groom's religious background and the attudes of his new church have enough in common that the transition really is no big deal as far as the religious dimension is concerned? If so, the movie doesn't make that clear either. It is said at one point that the bride's family is &quot;very relogious&quot; while the groom's family is not. But no specifics of that religion are hinted at, nor is any indication of what degree of new religious duty that places on the groom.",4,"Entertaining Movie, but there's something missing",1046304000,"02 27, 2003",2003,3574,"['lots', 'drama', 'comedy', 'movie', 'said', 'be', 'more', 'less', 'autobiographic', 'lead', 'actress', 'Nia', 'Vardalos', 'character', 'movie', 'named', 'Toula', 'very', 'traditional', 'Greek-American', 'family', 'father', 'being', 'especially', 'firmly', 'rooted', 'Greek', 'ways', 'subject', 'going', 'bonkers', 'thought', 'daughter', 'not', 'marrying', 'Greek', 'person', 'Toula', 'daughter', 'much', 'more', 'mind', 'own', 'father', 'first', 'pursue', 'education', 'make', 'life', 'other', 'waitress', 'family', 'restaurant', 'Such', 'goals', 'constitute', 'family', 'crisis', 'eyes', 'family', 'especially', 'father', 'goals', 'father', 'crisis', 'way', 'love', 'guy', 'fate', 'would', 'have', 'yes', 'guessed', ""n't"", 'Greek', 'Getting', 'family', 'accept', 'idea', 'marrying', 'will', 'occupy', 'much', 'plot', 'lot', 'story', 'presumably', 'realistic', 'good', 'dose', 'laughter', 'Maybe', 'sort', 'comic', 'licence', 'justifies', 'departure', 'absolute', 'realism', 'One', 'thing', 'had', 'trouble', 'finding', 'believable', 'how', 'Toula', 'out', 'awkward', 'sometimes', 'nearly', 'catatonic', 'state', 'then', 'suddenly', 'one', 'vivacious', 'grace', 'finding', 'guy', 'affections', 'attracted', 'too', 'Once', 'what', 'touching', 'humorous', 'insight', 'process', 'family', 'acceptance', 'quot', 'culture', 'shock', 'quot', 'bringing', 'bride', 'groom', 'families', 'together', 'latter', 'being', 'mainfested', 'especially', 'poignantly', 'groom', 'quot', 'waspish', 'quot', 'parents', 'bride', 'groom', 'decide', 'family', 'especially', 'father', 'course', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'bear', 'being', 'deprived', 'full-scale', 'big', 'traditional', 'Greek', 'wedding', 'daughter', 'being', 'maried', 'Greek', 'Orthodox', 'Church', 'turn', 'groom', 'must', 'become', 'member', 'thereof', 'baptism', 'church', 'then', 'key', 'episode', 'movie', 'So', 'movie', 'rich', 'insight', 'clash', 'cultures', 'brought', 'union', 'two', 'people', 'different', 'backgrounds', 'being', 'baptised', 'new', 'church', 'religious', 'event', 'what', 'movie', 'skip', 'over', 'lightly', 'No', 'insight', 'be', 'given', 'what', 'new', 'religious', 'groom', 'buying', 'joining', 'church', 'new', 'vital', 'part', 'what', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'concerned', 'joining', 'new', 'church', 'order', 'be', 'married', 'there', 'other', 'reason', 'movie', ""n't"", 'seem', 'treat', 'as', 'relevant', 'new', 'things', 'groom', 'family', 'become', 'acquainted', 'include', 'cuisine', 'drink', 'importance', 'extended', 'family', 'Greek', 'community', 'children', 'attendance', 'Greek', 'school', 'latter', 'not', 'shown', 'movie', 'have', 'specifically', 'religious', 'dimension', 'only', 'characteistic', 'Greek', 'school', 'portrayed', 'study', 'Greek', 'language', 'religious', 'dimension', 'would', 'be', 'major', 'concern', 'anyone', 'considering', 'joining', 'new', 'church', 'order', 'marry', 'there', 'movie', 'strictly', 'regard', 'big', 'deal', 'groom', 'religious', 'background', 'attudes', 'new', 'church', 'have', 'enough', 'common', 'transition', 'really', 'big', 'deal', 'as', 'far', 'religious', 'dimension', 'concerned', 'so', 'movie', ""n't"", 'make', 'clear', 'said', 'one', 'point', 'bride', 'family', 'quot', 'very', 'relogious', 'quot', 'groom', 'family', 'not', 'specifics', 'religion', 'are', 'hinted', 'indication', 'what', 'degree', 'new', 'religious', 'duty', 'groom']",N/A

Which is, perhaps ironically, building up expectations higher than is really fair.The film is a sweet, light and fun romantic comedy with visibily middle-tier production values. The much-hyped ethnicity of the central characters is something that, for the most part, we haven't really seen in mainstream American cinema, but at the same time, only the particulars make it unique: In many ways, this is the same story we've seen dozens of times about Jewish characters, Italian-American characters, Irish-American characters, et cetera. This isn't a condemnation of the film, but I do disagree that this is something startling and unique.The cast are generally of a high quality, and it's especially nice to see John Corbett resurface after too many years out of the limelight. (And where are the &quot;Northern Exposure&quot; DVD sets, already?) The writing is charming, but unexceptional, but particular note needs to be made of writer/star Nia Vardalos, who is by no means a classic romantic lead, and who is made up to look her worst through much of the film, to the point of it being almost a little embarassing to watch at times. While the attraction Corbett's character feels for her is never properly explored, it's wonderful to watch her flower in the light of his affection.Not the best romantic comedy ever, but a rewarding and entertaining film.

It was like listening to my siblings and I talk about some of our family reunions where the stories get exaggerated just a tad, but then again we couldn't possibly do justice to just how odd some of our relatives really are. The beyond personal questions, the running commentaries on your life, the, sometimes exaggerated, fears relatives have that you will never marry....it's all captured on film in a most delightful way in this movie.When Nia Vardalos shares her feelings of not fitting into the world around her, and not always fitting into the family she was born in, I could relate. I was rooting for her when she tackled her mono-brow, laughed in sympathy when she turned into a total goof around the object of her affections, and envied her her family. I went to the movie to be entertained, and I was in a big way. I was also touched. This one is a keeper, and goes into my film library.

714493,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B00006FMUW,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[2, 2]","The surprise blockbuster film of 2002, My Big Fat Greek Wedding won over the hearts of movie viewers everywhere with its light-hearted comedy and interesting characters. Written by Nia Vardalos (who also stars in the lead role), My Big Fat Greek Wedding - which was originally intended for the stage - garnered the talented writer an Academy Award nomination for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen. A feel-good, family-oriented film, My Big Fat Greek Wedding is one film movie buffs everywhere won't want to miss...Living in Chicago, Toula Portokalos (Nia Vardalos) is a thirty-year-old single woman working in her family's restaurant, Dancing Zorba's. In dire need of a makeover and hoping for a life beyond the restaurant, Toula and her mother conspire to convince Toula's father Gus (Michael Constantine) that she should take some computer classes. Gus demands it (believing it's his idea), but his first wish for Toula is that she will marry a good Greek man.Seeking a new life of career advancement, Toula again enlists her mother's aid in convincing her father that she should go to work at her Aunt Voula's (Andrea Martin) travel agency. In addition to her new career, Toula gets a total makeover to go with her new life. But things take an unexpected twist when, while working at the travel agency, Toula catches the eye of a local high school English teacher, Ian Miller (John Corbett). The two begin dating, and they fall in love. Only one problem, though... Ian isn't Greek!When Gus finds out that his daughter has been secretly dating a non-Greek, he's furious. But when Ian and Toula decide to get married, Gus must learn to accept his new son-in-law-to-be. Ian must learn to accept Toula's big family, and Toula must learn to accept herself...Nia Vardalos exhibits her true out-of-this-world talent when she performs not only as the writer of My Big Fat Greek Wedding, but also as the lead character Toula. Playing her part to perfection, Vardalos creates an onscreen chemistry with John Corbett which is simply magical. The couple comes across as realistic and fun, yet not overly clich&eacute;d and melodramatic in their pronouncements to one another. The result is that My Big Fat Greek Wedding becomes a true celebration of happiness for two individuals (one the audience feels privy to).Overall, My Big Fat Greek Wedding is a smash success - as a comedy, a romantic comedy, and a clash of cultures comedy. Vardalos's uncanny portrayal of an American Greek family where half the relatives are named Nick or Maria is hilarious. And the blending of two people and two families into one despite the differences between them is an uplifting and inspiring story that can't help but merit a smile. Nia Vardalos is charming as the sweet and innocent Toula, and her writing is beyond compare - that's why My Big Fat Greek Wedding is a definite must-see film you can't afford to miss...The DVD Report",5,One Big Fat Hilarious Greek Comedy!,1113955200,"04 20, 2005",2005,2931,"['surprise', 'blockbuster', 'film', '2002', 'My', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'Wedding', 'won', 'hearts', 'movie', 'viewers', 'everywhere', 'light-hearted', 'comedy', 'interesting', 'characters', 'Written', 'Nia', 'Vardalos', 'who', 'also', 'lead', 'role', 'My', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'Wedding', 'was', 'originally', 'intended', 'stage', 'garnered', 'talented', 'writer', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Writing', 'Screenplay', 'Written', 'Directly', 'Screen', 'feel-good', 'family-oriented', 'film', 'My', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'Wedding', 'one', 'film', 'movie', 'buffs', 'everywhere', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss', 'Living', 'Chicago', 'Toula', 'Portokalos', 'Nia', 'Vardalos', 'thirty-year-old', 'single', 'woman', 'working', 'family', 'restaurant', 'Dancing', 'Zorba', 'dire', 'need', 'makeover', 'hoping', 'life', 'restaurant', 'Toula', 'mother', 'conspire', 'convince', 'Toula', 'father', 'Gus', 'Michael', 'Constantine', 'should', 'take', 'computer', 'classes', 'Gus', 'believing', 'idea', 'first', 'wish', 'Toula', 'will', 'marry', 'good', 'Greek', 'man.Seeking', 'new', 'life', 'career', 'advancement', 'Toula', 'again', 'mother', 'aid', 'convincing', 'father', 'should', 'go', 'work', 'Aunt', 'Voula', 'Andrea', 'Martin', 'travel', 'agency', 'addition', 'new', 'career', 'Toula', 'total', 'makeover', 'go', 'new', 'life', 'things', 'take', 'unexpected', 'twist', 'when', 'working', 'travel', 'agency', 'Toula', 'eye', 'local', 'high', 'school', 'English', 'teacher', 'Ian', 'Miller', 'John', 'Corbett', 'two', 'begin', 'dating', 'fall', 'love', 'Only', 'one', 'problem', 'Ian', ""n't"", 'Greek', 'When', 'Gus', 'out', 'daughter', 'been', 'secretly', 'dating', 'non-Greek', 'furious', 'when', 'Ian', 'Toula', 'decide', 'get', 'married', 'Gus', 'must', 'learn', 'accept', 'new', 'son-in-law-to-be', 'Ian', 'must', 'learn', 'accept', 'Toula', 'big', 'family', 'Toula', 'must', 'learn', 'accept', 'Nia', 'Vardalos', 'true', 'out-of-this-world', 'talent', 'when', 'not', 'only', 'writer', 'My', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'Wedding', 'also', 'lead', 'character', 'Toula', 'Playing', 'part', 'perfection', 'Vardalos', 'onscreen', 'chemistry', 'John', 'Corbett', 'simply', 'magical', 'couple', 'realistic', 'fun', 'yet', 'not', 'overly', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'melodramatic', 'pronouncements', 'one', 'result', 'My', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'Wedding', 'true', 'celebration', 'happiness', 'two', 'individuals', 'one', 'audience', 'feels', 'privy', '.Overall', 'My', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'Wedding', 'smash', 'success', 'comedy', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'clash', 'cultures', 'comedy', 'Vardalos', 'uncanny', 'portrayal', 'American', 'Greek', 'family', 'where', 'relatives', 'are', 'named', 'Nick', 'Maria', 'hilarious', 'blending', 'two', 'people', 'two', 'families', 'one', 'differences', 'uplifting', 'inspiring', 'story', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'merit', 'smile', 'Nia', 'Vardalos', 'charming', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'Toula', 'writing', 'compare', 'why', 'My', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'Wedding', 'definite', 'must-see', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'miss', 'DVD', 'Report']",N/A

You will also find yourself laughing at a few areas in the movie and see nothing but bewildered stares from the non-greeks in the theater.  If you are not Greek you will simultaneously wish you were and be glad you are not when you see the closeness, love, overbearing nature and complete lack of any privacy poor Tula goes through in this film.The movie starts with Tula, a 30 year old Greek girl who is looked at as somewhat of a failure by the family because she has not done what she is supposed to do, Marry a Greek man, Have Greek Children, and cook for everybody until the day she dies.  but at least (As said by her aunt) she will be there to take care of her parents when they are old. As tula slowly starts to find her own way, thinking about goind to collage, switching jobs from the family resterant, ect.. enter Ian Miller, from a conservative, WASPy family, and somebody unlike everybody else in Tula's life.  This movie could have so easily de-generated into the typical Hollywood pap, i.e. become preachy about Tula's right to do what she wants, or done the Three's company plot of ""She tells a fib about her life, he finds out, gets angry, they make up at the end"" or lastly and most commonly, made out the WASP family to be bigoted and unaccepting characitures who finally come around after basking in the glow  emitted by the Greek family.  This movie did none of that, instead you follow Tula and Ian as they realize they are falling in love, and then get to sit through the hilarious real life trouble they have dealing with their differences, most especially Tulas relatives dissbelieve that she would date somebody non-Greek.  I gurantee you will NOT have a more enjoyable experience at the movies this year whether you are 12 or 92.  The main plot is wonderful, but the little side notes, such as Ians mother bringing a bundt Cake to tulas family and nonbody knowing what it is, or Tulas father believing that windex can cure almost anything, add just another layer to this movie until comedy perfection is achieved.  If your young daughters are refusing to go point out to them that a member of N'sync is in the cast then you can listen to them discuss whether or not he gained weight on the ride home.  The combination of comedy, real looking people, not large headed starved, botoxed former modles and the real sense of affection with which this writer tells the story are too few and far between.

714499,A2YXMN40D7WTGP,B00006FMUW,casualsuede,"[2, 3]","This isn't really a review of the movie, but how I feel the issues in the movie relate to real life situations....Many people think this movie is stereotypical or fake. I think many who are in multicultural relationships would disagree....The commercial for this movie does something interesting. When displaying the title at the end of the commercial, the title switches from Italian to Chinese to Indian, among other cultures. This is relevant because I think the topics and feeling that both the main character and the parents go through is pretty much universal.I guess you would have to be apart of this immigrant culture to understand this. My female cousins, all Orientals, married outside their cultural group (Polish, Scottish, Italian, Argentinian, Irish, etc.) and they all went through this. After listening to my parents, it looks like my aunts and uncles who had to deal with the foreign sons-in-laws and in-laws, also had it tough and many of them complained to their daughters on why they couldn't find a nice Asian male.Toula is a character that seems real to me, because I have friends that are in the same boat. A friend of mine, a high powered lawyer, whose parents are Russian, is scared to death to tell her parents that her love of her life is Jewish. Another friend who is 2nd generation South African has a boyfriend who is Honduran and she feels that their relationship would kill her parents. Immigrant parents want their children to marry within their own cultural groups and it is hard for them to understand why they would go outside their culture when there are so many good Greek/Italian/Indian/WHATEVER guys that are available (at least to what they think).Toula is a homely girl and lacks self-confidence because her whole life has been about rejecting her culture. She sees that all the pretty girls are WASPY, slim and blonde, while she is the complete opposite and this has hurt her perspective of life. However, for some reason, she wants to break out of the mold and improve herself, not to find a guy but to live her life her own way.Of course, her parents do not see this, all she needs to do is to follow her advice and she should be happy right? This is the dilemma that many 1st/2nd generation people fall under, it is the New World/Old World conflict that many of us (including guys) can relate to.She falls for a WASPY guy and he turns out to be nice and kind, he seems to have no bad traits. While many people may scoff at this, I also find that that men (especially my cousins-in-law) who date women outside their cultures, often have more patience and are more willing to accept a second culture than other guys. I don't really see it as much in women in my experience. However, as a movie-going experience, it may come across as pretty boring.The secondary characters are a hoot, if not a little cartoony. Aunt Voola is played up by Andrea Martin and she has a blast playing the matter of fact aunt. Martin Constantine also does a magnificent job as Gus, Toula's father. He is stubborn and scary for Toula, but all he seems to want is to be told of stuff and have things done the right way (a funny exchange comes when Gus doesn't understand why Ian didn't ask her to go out with Toula and Ian doesn't understand why he would have to ask since she's 30 years old--A funny clash of cultures).But the best is Maria, played by Lainie Kazan. She may be a little kooky, but she always is wise and knows what to say to make things right. She had my mother nodding in agreement throughout the whole movie when I showed it to her. Other characters like her sister, brother and cousins are merely time-fillers and have little purpose IMO.Another set of characters that seem to be stereotyped is Ian's parents. I have met alot of ignorant WASP parents, but they seem to be charactiatures of Nia Vardalos' vision of what WASP parents are like.So overall, I find that MBFGW to be more about real-life than about Hollywood romantic storytelling. In most movies, people meet, hook up, get engaged and get married. Opposed to movies like ""How to lose a guy in 10 minutes"" which has to go through a whole complicated plotline for people to fall in love. The reason why so many people watched this movie is because they could relate to the nature of this relationship and the issues that it brings. It's about a pretty homely woman who fixes herself out to turn into a regular (if not pretty) girl. She isn't a knockout, but she is interesting and different and for Ian (BTW: her real husband Ian is Mike the teacher in the movie) that is a marrying woman....Rating: B+",4,MBFGW is more about real life than moviemaking,1120694400,"07 7, 2005",2005,4602,"[""n't"", 'really', 'review', 'movie', 'how', 'feel', 'issues', 'movie', 'relate', 'real', 'life', 'situations', '.Many', 'people', 'think', 'movie', 'stereotypical', 'fake', 'think', 'many', 'who', 'are', 'multicultural', 'relationships', 'would', 'disagree', 'commercial', 'movie', 'something', 'interesting', 'When', 'displaying', 'title', 'end', 'commercial', 'title', 'switches', 'Italian', 'Chinese', 'Indian', 'other', 'cultures', 'relevant', 'think', 'topics', 'feeling', 'main', 'character', 'parents', 'go', 'pretty', 'much', 'universal.I', 'guess', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'apart', 'immigrant', 'culture', 'understand', 'female', 'cousins', 'Orientals', 'married', 'cultural', 'group', 'Polish', 'Scottish', 'Italian', 'Argentinian', 'Irish', 'etc', 'went', 'listening', 'parents', 'aunts', 'uncles', 'who', 'had', 'deal', 'foreign', 'sons-in-laws', 'in-laws', 'also', 'had', 'tough', 'many', 'complained', 'daughters', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'nice', 'Asian', 'male.Toula', 'character', 'real', 'have', 'friends', 'are', 'same', 'boat', 'friend', 'mine', 'high', 'powered', 'lawyer', 'parents', 'are', 'Russian', 'scared', 'death', 'tell', 'parents', 'love', 'life', 'Jewish', 'friend', 'who', '2nd', 'generation', 'South', 'African', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'Honduran', 'relationship', 'would', 'kill', 'parents', 'Immigrant', 'parents', 'want', 'children', 'marry', 'own', 'cultural', 'groups', 'hard', 'understand', 'why', 'would', 'go', 'culture', 'when', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'good', 'Greek/Italian/Indian/WHATEVER', 'guys', 'are', 'available', 'least', 'what', 'think', '.Toula', 'homely', 'girl', 'self-confidence', 'whole', 'life', 'been', 'rejecting', 'culture', 'pretty', 'girls', 'are', 'WASPY', 'slim', 'blonde', 'complete', 'opposite', 'hurt', 'perspective', 'life', 'However', 'reason', 'break', 'mold', 'improve', 'not', 'find', 'guy', 'live', 'life', 'own', 'way.Of', 'course', 'parents', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'do', 'follow', 'advice', 'should', 'be', 'happy', 'right', 'dilemma', 'many', '1st/2nd', 'generation', 'people', 'fall', 'New', 'World/Old', 'World', 'conflict', 'many', 'including', 'guys', 'can', 'relate', 'to.She', 'WASPY', 'guy', 'out', 'be', 'nice', 'kind', 'have', 'bad', 'traits', 'many', 'people', 'may', 'scoff', 'also', 'find', 'men', 'especially', 'cousins-in-law', 'who', 'date', 'women', 'cultures', 'often', 'have', 'more', 'patience', 'are', 'more', 'willing', 'accept', 'second', 'culture', 'other', 'guys', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'as', 'much', 'women', 'experience', 'However', 'movie-going', 'experience', 'may', 'come', 'pretty', 'boring.The', 'secondary', 'characters', 'are', 'hoot', 'not', 'little', 'cartoony', 'Aunt', 'Voola', 'played', 'up', 'Andrea', 'Martin', 'blast', 'playing', 'matter', 'fact', 'aunt', 'Martin', 'Constantine', 'also', 'magnificent', 'job', 'Gus', 'Toula', 'father', 'stubborn', 'scary', 'Toula', 'want', 'be', 'told', 'stuff', 'have', 'things', 'done', 'right', 'way', 'funny', 'exchange', 'when', 'Gus', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'Ian', 'did', ""n't"", 'ask', 'go', 'out', 'Toula', 'Ian', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'would', 'have', 'ask', '30', 'years', 'old', 'funny', 'clash', 'cultures', '.But', 'best', 'Maria', 'played', 'Lainie', 'Kazan', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'kooky', 'always', 'wise', 'what', 'say', 'make', 'things', 'right', 'had', 'mother', 'nodding', 'agreement', 'whole', 'movie', 'when', 'showed', 'Other', 'characters', 'sister', 'brother', 'cousins', 'are', 'merely', 'time-fillers', 'have', 'little', 'purpose', 'IMO.Another', 'set', 'characters', 'seem', 'be', 'stereotyped', 'Ian', 'parents', 'have', 'met', 'alot', 'ignorant', 'WASP', 'parents', 'seem', 'be', 'charactiatures', 'Nia', 'Vardalos', 'vision', 'what', 'WASP', 'parents', 'are', 'like.So', 'overall', 'find', 'MBFGW', 'be', 'more', 'real-life', 'Hollywood', 'romantic', 'storytelling', 'most', 'movies', 'people', 'meet', 'hook', 'up', 'get', 'engaged', 'get', 'married', 'Opposed', 'movies', 'How', 'lose', 'guy', '10', 'minutes', 'go', 'whole', 'complicated', 'plotline', 'people', 'fall', 'love', 'reason', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'watched', 'movie', 'could', 'relate', 'nature', 'relationship', 'issues', 'pretty', 'homely', 'woman', 'who', 'fixes', 'turn', 'regular', 'not', 'pretty', 'girl', ""n't"", 'knockout', 'interesting', 'different', 'Ian', 'BTW', 'real', 'husband', 'Ian', 'Mike', 'teacher', 'movie', 'marrying', 'woman', '.Rating', 'B+']",N/A

The father, a very prideful greek, can find the greek root of any word,(i.e kimono) and loves Windex. The main character, Toula, is somewhat of an out cast from the rest of her family, she is not married and doesn't seem to what to. One day while working in her father's resturant, she see's the man of her dreams, Ian. So eventully they meet, fall in love, and start going out under the cover that she is taking a pottery class. Since Ian is a non-greek, her very ethnic family would not approve, most of all, her father. So eventully her family finds out about their love, and finally after several tries to get her to fall in love with another Greek, the give in and must accept the fact that they are getting married. You can guess the rest. From her on, it gets funnier and funnier, until the heartwarming ending. The reason I dont give it five stars, is the fact there are a few parts where it can get slow enough, to the point of uninterest.

It's difficult to throw these elements into a comedy without crossing the dangerous borderline of parody, and she does this beautifully. You find yourself appreciating the nuances of this film's portayal of a culture you may not be familliar with because you see your own family in hers, no matter what the nationality.And John Corrbett should just plan on a career as a romantic lead. His Ian is the perfect man you would want for yourself, best friend, daughter, etc. Corbett brings a 'dreamboat' presence that resonates with romantic honesty and charm, and he also manages to be 'everyguy.' His character works because he never seems 'out of your league' perfect.Michael Constantine is brilliant at Tula's father. His Greek ethinicy is brilliantly conveyed in ecentricities that are actually more particular to fatherhood than Greek culture.This is a wonderful little film that will make you long to fall in love if you haven't already, and make you appreciate who you love if you are in love.

714512,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B00006FMUW,Craig MACKINNON,"[0, 0]","Nia Vardalos is a veteran comedienne from the Second City group in Chicago.  This film is a catharsis of sorts, as only a gifted comedienne can present: growing up as one of the few Greek girls in Winnepeg, surrounded by blonde Anglos and Ukrainians, she undoubtedly felt left out and turned to comedy to be accepted.This film is beautifully performed and written.  Vardalos herself plays the heroine, Toula, who is painfully shy and somewhat downtrodden, living in the shadow of an older, &quot;perfect sister.&quot;  When she decides to make something of herself - by going to college and specialising in &quot;Computers in the Travel Industry,&quot; she is noticed by a typical white-bread American, Ian Miller.  The movie follows their courtship with special emphasis on the contrast between Toula's Greek and Ian's WASP families.  Of course, since this is a comedy, everything is exaggerated - Ian's parents are stiff and reserved to a fault, while Toula's house is filled with 50 relatives at any given time.  There is also some fun inter-generational humour, as Toula (and her brother) try to break free of the old-world mold of their parents.  Some of the funniest moments are Toula's father lamenting that her over-education led her astray (i.e. into the arms of a non-Greek).Although such a description implies there is an undercurrent of racism (or, at least, ethnic chauvenism), the movie is never mean-spirited.  In fact, it's almost naive in its good-naturedness, in that everyone ends up getting along and the two families come together wonderfully.  If only real life were as life-affirming as this film!  It is family film in that it is funny, warm-hearted, and contains no unsuitable material, although I suspect younger children will find the plot boring and not get most of the jokes.Unfortunately, this DVD version is not up to the standards of the film.  The commentary, mostly by Vardalos, is interesting and points out a number of true-to-life events that were incorporated into the film, in addition to pointing out various friends and family members that appear in the film.  However, there are no cut scenes, no documentaries, etc.  Worse still, there are something like 7 ads for other movies at the beginning of the film, that you have to manually skip - this is a sure-fire way to anger your audience before the film even starts.

However, the movie wasn't as funny as I thought it would be (and I saw it early on before the hype).

Theater was packed, an indication of the popularity of this film. It has been around 13 weeks, I'm told, and it reached our unreachable neighborhood.It was fun and funny, though the jokes were rather standard Greek clich&eacute;s, or pre-conceptions of Greek-American families; daddy too conservative to allow daughter (now pushing thirty) to date any other male than a Greek; Greek brothers and sisters, a ""Greek"" mother (played by Elaine Kazan who is black), Greek aunts, dozens of cousins, an little bundle of a grandmother, daffy and senile who still thinks the Turks are after her, and other such absolutely ridiculous situations. Of Course Toula, the daughter, inevitably meets an American young man she likes, breaks loose from the tightness of the family restaurant, where she is a waitress, open a travel bureau (""Olympus""), and eventually she becomes liberated.The two families--the American and the Greek--are studies in contrast, and both caricatures. It works at a certain level, the jokes keep tumbling from the mouths of innocents, the music is good, there is some dancing (inevitable in all things Greeks), and even a Zorba's diner (also inevitable) and testament to the lingering influence of the movie Zorba the Greek, which does not mean that the movie is anywhere as serious as that; in fact, it is a romantic comedy that, despite all the misunderstandings and little innocent brawls, ties nicely together, for there is nothing unpleasant, no ugly scenes anywhere, just good-hearted fun.Fresh, and innovative because of that quality, so lacking in today's blockbuster nothings that populate the screens these days.

714527,AUEHG0DB54B7K,B00006FMUW,David A. Wend,"[2, 3]","This is an irresistible film that can be watched again and again with the same level of fun.  Having known many Greeks at one point in my life, I was able to relate to the ethnic points made in My Big Fat Greek Wedding, and it took me back to those days long past. But it is hardly necessary to have such preparation to discover the generosity and warmth embodied in the Greek spirit.  I must agree with other reviewers that the Greek family, and indeed the wedding itself, could be transposed to a Jewish or Lebanese ethnic setting.The film could not have been better cast, and the performances are honest and excellent.  The charm of this film was best expressed by the viewers themselves who went several times to see it, keeping it in the top ten films for months. Probably the most refreshing part of My Big Fat Greek Wedding is that Toula (Nia Vardalos) is a character who can easily be identified with; she is insecure about herself and is dominated by her family.  However, her family did not envision that she would fall for a non-Greek named Ian (John Corbett).  The family eventually comes to accept Ian but along the way Toula has to endure the doubts of her ethnically centered family.The focus of the film is Toula&#65533;s family and her struggles to marry the man of her choice.  Consequentially, there is little about Ian&#65533;s family; they seem not to be opposed to their son marrying Toula. There is no friction between Ian and Toula, despite the hurdles Ian must cross on his way to joining the family, like his baptism into the Orthodox faith.

It is a delight. The acting is fine, of course, but finally it is the writing. The script is fantastic, a work of genius. What is so great is the author's ability to catch at each turn those little, tiny moments that say so much. The running gag over the Windex, for example, is hilarious, especially when the WASP groom takes it up. It shows the new connection between the father and son-in-law, while obviously just being silly. The film takes up a classic fish-out-of-water plot but, by emphasizing the cross-cultural connection, the story seems fresh and new. Both families are priceless. The characterization is so finely tuned, so accurate and true to character. Take the aunt, for instance: how funny she is when Toula's soon-to-be- husband announces that he is a vegetarian. ""You don't eat no meat?"" she says with some astonishment. Then: ""OK. I'll make lamb."" There are running gags, but also deep themes such as self-discovery, love, loyalty, and so on.

When my wife and I first saw this in the theater a decade ago, we laughed out loud through much of the movie--along with everyone else in the packed theater.  I have never seen an audience so in touch with a movie (except perhaps for Lord of the Rings on opening night, but that was for different reasons).  My Big Fat Greek Wedding resonates with ordinary people like us.It was nice watching the movie in hi-def this time.  Even though this is not the kind of film where hi-def makes that much difference, purists will nevertheless appreciate the upgrade in quality from the DVD.  Details are sharper, and colors pop.  The sound is also good.  There is a flashback scene early in the movie that has noticeable film grain.  But apart from that, the transfer is great.  If you find the blu-ray for a good price, it is worth the upgrade.Parental Advisory: The movie is rated PG.  It has some mild language (mostly for humorous effect), several kissing scenes (some of which are passionate), and one female character who is not particularly modest.  Intimacy between an unmarried couple is implied but not shown in a couple of scenes.  Some parents might feel uncomfortable about their smaller children watching this, but probably would be okay with their junior high students seeing it--perhaps with a word about the appropriateness (rather the inappropriateness) of premarital intimacy.With this caveat aside, I recommend this movie.

714534,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,B00006FMUW,Deborah Earle,"[0, 1]","""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" depicts the life of a Greek-American woman in her thirties who is under enormous pressure to marry and have children by her very traditional father (Michael Constantine) who refuses to embrace modern values and accept his middle child as she is. Life is made a little easier for her by her cheerful and understanding mother, played by Lainie Kazan.I somehow feel that Toula, played with both pathos and skillful comic timing by Nia Vardalous, who adapted her hit play for the big screen, could only be a middle child. Sandwitched between her ""older, perfect sister"", Athena (played by a nagging and very Type A Stavroula Logothettis) and her prankish but supportive younger brother Nick(Louis Mandylor), she starts out as an insecure girl whose notoriously ethnocentric parents send her to school with a lunchbox with the image of the Greek flag  on it instead of something more trendy, make her attend Greek school when her classmates attend Brownies, and never give her a satisfactory explanation about why she is constantly on a divergent path from others. As a young adult working in her family's restaurant, she deals with constant familial discussions about her marital status as if she isn't there to listen to them, she cannot ask for her father's support of her decision to return to school with any confidence(although she gets her way gradually), and later, when she embraces John Corbett's staid, friendly, and well-mannered non-Greek Ian Miller as her suitor, her parents challenge her decision by forcing the hapless Toula to play hostess to an obnoxious parade of men of her own nationality, whom they quite unbelievably prefer as mates for their daughter.It seems that older or younger children in a family are less likely to be under that much pressure to tow the line.Physically, it has to be noted that Nia Vardalous has dignified classic Greek features, reminiscent of  the profile portraiture on Grecian urns.In due time, we come to know Toula's large, boisterous extended family, including her Aunt Voula (Andrea Martin) who can be gauche and rather pushy,but funny, Yiayia (Bess Meisler)who is a walking example of war-related Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,and who clings as tenaciously to life as she does to her Greek Peasant garb, and the scene-stealing Gia Carides' big-haired, brassy, buxom,flamboyant, life-loving and gregarious drama queen, Nikki, to name a few.The groom's parents (Bruce Grey and Fiona Reid)are rather overwhelmed by the bride's family and their customs,but gradually come to embrace them, and Toula grows into someone who accepts her family and develops a more mature understanding of herself and appreciation for her heritage.While this film should be viewed with a grain of salt and not be taken as a definitive portrayal of Greek family life, it has an enjoyable livliness to it, enhanced by kicky bouzouki music, and because family eccentricties are often great onscreen fodder, it has been, quite understandably, a great success.

Michael Constantine as family patriarch Gus Portokalos (the &quot;Windex Man&quot;) is delightfully over the top.  Name a word--any word--and he'll prove it's derived from the Greek language.  The sprawling Portokalos clan takes center stage here; imagine your most boisterous family union, multiply it by ten, and you'll match the energy of this family's get-togethers.The film centers around the romance and subsequent engagement of Toula Portokalos (Nia Vardalos), deemed an &quot;old maid&quot; by her family, and yuppie Ian Miller (John Corbett), who is kind and likeable, but--gasp!--not Greek.  Toula does her best to insulate her fiance from the rowdiness of her huge family, but for Ian it's baptism by fire from the start.  The &quot;cultural indoctrination&quot; is intense.

This is basically, as the writer has stated herself on the DVD, a fun movie about a woman who comes out of her shell, meets a great man, and starts living her life.  Then we get to see how her big Greek family helps her on her way.Written by a woman of full-Greek heritage, and featuring mostly Greek Heritage actors in the family roles, this movie is a hilarious and heartwarming view of Greek life, and was taken from real events in the writer's life.  But even if you're not Greek (like me), it is a slice of life we can all relate to, from generation quirks, to overzealous relatives offering Big-Day help.This is a wonderful little movie, featuring real people, lacking gratuitous extras, that anyone can enjoy.

714560,A2SRZQU1SZG4RR,B00006FMUW,"Erika Borsos ""pepper flower""","[8, 9]","Nia Vardalas stars as Toula, the plain unadorned 30 year old single, ""unmarried"" daughter of a Greek family who have successfully assimilated into American life. They are the owners of ""Dancing Zorba's"" a popular neighborhood Greek Restaurant in Chicago. Like Greeks everywhere, the cultural values are instilled into the offspring early in life and the extended family is *most* important ... it is central to their lives. This film is a light-hearted comedy which exaggerates some of the amusing moments about a good obedient daughter who is trying to meet the expectations of her Greek immigrant parents and who is also trying to be independent and make a life for herself.While fulfilling her parents wishes and living within the cultural milieu of the family, Toula dreams of some independence ... she realizes she can contribute something more than being a seating hostess and cashier at the family restaurant. She recalls being in grammar school when she was the only dark brown haired girl, sitting alone eating her packed lunch, home-made ""moussaka"". At the next table a group of blond haired girls were laughing and asked her what she was eating, Toula told them. Afterwards, one had mocked her food, calling it ""moose kaka"", making all the girls giggle. At that age Toula  felt she was an outsider ... now as a young adult, she wants to spread her wings, take a course at the local university, prove her self-worth and that she is intelligent, not so different from everyone else. She receives the support of her mother and Aunt who convince her dad that she would be a valuable asset at her Aunt's travel agency ... he agrees and they exchange family employees, her male cousin will work at Dancing Zorbas, while Toula will work at the travel agency. After this point in the film, Toula blossoms from a ""plain Jane"" into an attractive young lady who begins expressing her own interests apart from the family circle. While working at the agency ... a young man walks past the window and waves to her. She recalls he was a customer at Dancing Zorba's, when she was plainly dressed, awkward and shy, while serving him coffee. Now, she is both embarrassed and flatterred by his amusing antics as he tries to capture her attention when working. His ploy works ... they meet and date. Toula makes excuses to the family that she is taking a pottery class in the evening so that she can see Ian Miller, who is a grammar school teacher and vegetarian. He comes from a family that is best described as W.A.S.P.The film has a superb build up of comedy and suspense as Toula and Ian become more serious. They learn about their unique differences but appreciate each other even more and consider them assets. One of the climaxes in the film is when Toula's female cousin catches her kissing Ian at the travel agency ... The cousin mentions the family knows Toula is dating a non-Greek because an Aunt saw them together and spread the news like wild fire. Ian learns protocol and asks Gus Portokalas, Toula's dad, for permission to date his daughter. Gus refuses because Ian is not Greek. Eventually, the families meet and iron out their differences as both Toula and Ian fall further in love ... The manner in which the couple win over Toula's dad and family is the stuff of great comedy. Both families gradually accept that Toula and Ian are meant for each other and will get married ... but only *after* Ian agrees to convert to the Greek Orthodox so he can marry within her church. Anyone familiar with Greeks who live in the USA will recognize the amusing characters, typical behavior and values that are so realisticlly portrayed in this film. The cast of characters is perfect. This film will appeal to a large audience of different age groups who enjoy comedy and romance.Erika Borsos (erikab93)",5,Heart-Warming Comedy and Romance,1127692800,"09 26, 2005",2005,3801,"['Nia', 'Vardalas', 'Toula', 'plain', 'unadorned', '30', 'year', 'old', 'single', 'unmarried', 'daughter', 'Greek', 'family', 'who', 'have', 'successfully', 'assimilated', 'American', 'life', 'are', 'owners', 'Dancing', 'Zorba', 'popular', 'neighborhood', 'Greek', 'Restaurant', 'Chicago', 'Greeks', 'everywhere', 'cultural', 'values', 'are', 'instilled', 'offspring', 'early', 'life', 'extended', 'family', '*most*', 'important', 'central', 'lives', 'film', 'light-hearted', 'comedy', 'amusing', 'moments', 'good', 'obedient', 'daughter', 'who', 'trying', 'meet', 'expectations', 'Greek', 'immigrant', 'parents', 'who', 'also', 'trying', 'be', 'independent', 'make', 'life', 'herself.While', 'fulfilling', 'parents', 'wishes', 'living', 'cultural', 'milieu', 'family', 'Toula', 'dreams', 'independence', 'can', 'contribute', 'something', 'more', 'being', 'seating', 'hostess', 'cashier', 'family', 'restaurant', 'being', 'grammar', 'school', 'when', 'was', 'only', 'dark', 'brown', 'haired', 'girl', 'sitting', 'alone', 'eating', 'packed', 'lunch', 'home-made', 'moussaka', 'next', 'table', 'group', 'blond', 'haired', 'girls', 'were', 'laughing', 'asked', 'what', 'was', 'eating', 'Toula', 'told', 'Afterwards', 'one', 'had', 'mocked', 'food', 'calling', 'moose', 'kaka', 'making', 'girls', 'giggle', 'age', 'Toula', 'felt', 'was', 'outsider', 'now', 'young', 'adult', 'spread', 'wings', 'take', 'course', 'local', 'university', 'prove', 'self-worth', 'intelligent', 'not', 'so', 'different', 'everyone', 'else', 'support', 'mother', 'Aunt', 'who', 'convince', 'dad', 'would', 'be', 'valuable', 'asset', 'Aunt', 'travel', 'agency', 'exchange', 'family', 'employees', 'male', 'cousin', 'will', 'work', 'Dancing', 'Zorbas', 'Toula', 'will', 'work', 'travel', 'agency', 'point', 'film', 'Toula', 'plain', 'Jane', 'attractive', 'young', 'lady', 'who', 'expressing', 'own', 'interests', 'apart', 'family', 'circle', 'working', 'agency', 'young', 'man', 'walks', 'window', 'waves', 'was', 'customer', 'Dancing', 'Zorba', 'when', 'was', 'plainly', 'dressed', 'awkward', 'shy', 'serving', 'coffee', 'Now', 'embarrassed', 'flatterred', 'amusing', 'antics', 'capture', 'attention', 'when', 'working', 'ploy', 'works', 'meet', 'date', 'Toula', 'excuses', 'family', 'taking', 'pottery', 'class', 'evening', 'can', 'see', 'Ian', 'Miller', 'who', 'grammar', 'school', 'teacher', 'vegetarian', 'family', 'best', 'described', 'W.A.S.P.The', 'film', 'superb', 'build', 'comedy', 'suspense', 'Toula', 'Ian', 'become', 'more', 'serious', 'learn', 'unique', 'differences', 'appreciate', 'other', 'even', 'more', 'consider', 'assets', 'One', 'climaxes', 'film', 'when', 'Toula', 'female', 'cousin', 'catches', 'kissing', 'Ian', 'travel', 'agency', 'cousin', 'family', 'Toula', 'dating', 'non-Greek', 'Aunt', 'saw', 'together', 'spread', 'news', 'wild', 'fire', 'Ian', 'protocol', 'Gus', 'Portokalas', 'Toula', 'dad', 'permission', 'date', 'daughter', 'Gus', 'Ian', 'not', 'Greek', 'Eventually', 'families', 'meet', 'iron', 'out', 'differences', 'Toula', 'Ian', 'fall', 'further', 'love', 'manner', 'couple', 'win', 'Toula', 'dad', 'family', 'stuff', 'great', 'comedy', 'families', 'gradually', 'accept', 'Toula', 'Ian', 'are', 'meant', 'other', 'will', 'get', 'married', 'only', '*after*', 'Ian', 'convert', 'Greek', 'Orthodox', 'can', 'marry', 'church', 'Anyone', 'familiar', 'Greeks', 'who', 'live', 'USA', 'will', 'recognize', 'amusing', 'characters', 'typical', 'behavior', 'values', 'are', 'so', 'realisticlly', 'portrayed', 'film', 'cast', 'characters', 'perfect', 'film', 'will', 'appeal', 'large', 'audience', 'different', 'age', 'groups', 'who', 'enjoy', 'comedy', 'romance.Erika', 'Borsos', 'erikab93']",N/A
714561,A1CF3HY24VVWJP,B00006FMUW,Erik Pack,"[2, 3]","My Big Fat Greek Wedding is one of the most solid romantic comedies to come out in recent memory. Usually romantic comedies are a dime a dozen, either unspectacular, or mere teenage drudgery.(Think, how many Freddie Prinze Jr. movies have you seen?) However, Greek Wedding pulls off a difficult feat. It is a smart enough movie that doesn't have to result to sight gags or slapstick. And this movie just doesn't get boring. As I arrived at the theater I saw many sad eyed men, ranging from teenage to middle age. They all looked like they were going to have to watch regretfully, as if their girlfriends/wives had forced them. However, by the end of the film it was easy too see that they had enjoyed the movie as much as I had. It's not schmaltzy, and it's not one of those fairytale romance movies that no matter how implausible always make some women feel happy and cry. It's just an enjoyable film. That happens to involve A LOT of family. As you watch the movie you may be reminded of your own crazy family. And after this film, I think you'll decide that no matter how crazy they are, you're happy to have them.",4,Cute,1031529600,"09 9, 2002",2002,1117,"['Big', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'Wedding', 'one', 'most', 'solid', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'come', 'out', 'recent', 'memory', 'Usually', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'are', 'dime', 'dozen', 'unspectacular', 'mere', 'teenage', 'drudgery', 'Think', 'how', 'many', 'Freddie', 'Prinze', 'Jr.', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'However', 'Greek', 'Wedding', 'difficult', 'feat', 'smart', 'enough', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'result', 'sight', 'gags', 'slapstick', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'get', 'boring', 'arrived', 'theater', 'saw', 'many', 'sad', 'eyed', 'men', 'ranging', 'teenage', 'middle', 'age', 'looked', 'were', 'going', 'have', 'watch', 'regretfully', 'girlfriends/wives', 'had', 'forced', 'However', 'end', 'film', 'was', 'easy', 'too', 'see', 'had', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'had', 'not', 'schmaltzy', 'not', 'one', 'fairytale', 'romance', 'movies', 'matter', 'how', 'implausible', 'always', 'make', 'women', 'feel', 'happy', 'cry', 'just', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'involve', 'A', 'LOT', 'family', 'watch', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'reminded', 'own', 'crazy', 'family', 'film', 'think', ""'ll"", 'decide', 'matter', 'how', 'crazy', 'are', ""'re"", 'happy', 'have']",N/A
714562,AZ1PS5SHWHE0U,B00006FMUW,Erka16,"[0, 1]","Having seen this movie in the theaters about six months ago, I have been waiting impatiently to own this on DVD.  I am going to divide this review in two parts, the first one being reviewing the movie itself and the last part reviewing the actual DVD.As far as the movie is concerned, it is a great movie and one that I am happy with in my DVD/VHS collection.  I dragged my mother to see this movie.  She wasn't thrilled before the movie started but I think she quickly changed her mind once it started.Everyone can relate to this story, because we all have relatives.Nia Vardalos has written an refreshing comical screenplay that not only describes her family but just about everybody elses. It isn't the best movie that has come out of Hollywood, but who cares? I enjoyed laughing.... Compared to other films I have seen last year I was glad to spend the money on it and not only once but twice.In a nut shell this  movie is about a young women trying to deal with her Greek family expectations and dealing with the fact that she is in love and wants to marry a non-Greek man. And you don't have to be Greek to enjoy this movie.  As far as the other reviews saying that the Greek community doesn't like this movie because of all of the stereotypes, I'm not Greek but do you think that it would have made as much money if the movie was ""My Big Fat WASP Wedding""?  Vardalos wrote about what is familiar to her that is why it works.  The stereotypes in this movie are more dramatization than anything else...you have to make the characters quirky and funny. When I saw this movie for the first time I was associating people in my own family and situations I have gone through.Now for the DVD review:  I was disappointed in my DVD purchase.  The only advantage is that you get the widescreen edition and the full screen edition on the same DVD and don't have to chose between which one you want to purchase.  Of course most people don't have that problem, but if you are in a household with several people and some like the widescreen and the rest prefer the full.  It is a great feature.  That is the only great feature, the only other features avaible on the DVD are subtles in French, Spanish, English, and Greek.  The last feature is a biography section of the major actors in the film.  Now I know that this was an independent project, but have something a cut scene or something.  Some DVDs are worth buying for the DVD features, this is not one of them.  This is the reasoning behind my 4 star voting and I voted this way as the DVD.  The movie is funny and I am happy that I can watch it when I have the free time.  Just a little disappointed in what is offered on the DVD.",4,Funniest Movie of 2002,1045612800,"02 19, 2003",2003,2679,"['Having', 'seen', 'movie', 'theaters', 'six', 'months', 'ago', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'impatiently', 'own', 'DVD', 'am', 'going', 'divide', 'review', 'two', 'parts', 'first', 'one', 'being', 'reviewing', 'movie', 'last', 'part', 'reviewing', 'actual', 'DVD.As', 'far', 'movie', 'concerned', 'great', 'movie', 'one', 'am', 'happy', 'DVD/VHS', 'collection', 'dragged', 'mother', 'see', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'thrilled', 'movie', 'started', 'think', 'quickly', 'changed', 'mind', 'started.Everyone', 'can', 'relate', 'story', 'have', 'relatives.Nia', 'Vardalos', 'written', 'refreshing', 'comical', 'screenplay', 'not', 'only', 'family', 'just', 'everybody', 'elses', ""n't"", 'best', 'movie', 'come', 'Hollywood', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'laughing', 'Compared', 'other', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'last', 'year', 'was', 'glad', 'spend', 'money', 'not', 'only', 'once', 'twice.In', 'nut', 'shell', 'movie', 'young', 'women', 'trying', 'deal', 'Greek', 'family', 'expectations', 'dealing', 'fact', 'love', 'marry', 'non-Greek', 'man', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'Greek', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'As', 'far', 'other', 'reviews', 'saying', 'Greek', 'community', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'stereotypes', ""'m"", 'not', 'Greek', 'do', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'much', 'money', 'movie', 'was', 'Big', 'Fat', 'WASP', 'Wedding', 'Vardalos', 'wrote', 'what', 'familiar', 'why', 'stereotypes', 'movie', 'are', 'more', 'dramatization', 'anything', 'else', 'have', 'make', 'characters', 'quirky', 'funny', 'When', 'saw', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'associating', 'people', 'own', 'family', 'situations', 'have', 'gone', 'through.Now', 'DVD', 'review', 'was', 'disappointed', 'DVD', 'purchase', 'only', 'advantage', 'get', 'widescreen', 'edition', 'full', 'screen', 'edition', 'same', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'chose', 'one', 'want', 'purchase', 'course', 'most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'are', 'household', 'several', 'people', 'widescreen', 'rest', 'prefer', 'full', 'great', 'feature', 'only', 'great', 'feature', 'only', 'other', 'features', 'avaible', 'DVD', 'are', 'subtles', 'French', 'Spanish', 'English', 'Greek', 'last', 'feature', 'biography', 'section', 'major', 'actors', 'film', 'Now', 'know', 'was', 'independent', 'project', 'have', 'something', 'cut', 'scene', 'something', 'DVDs', 'are', 'worth', 'buying', 'DVD', 'features', 'not', 'one', 'reasoning', '4', 'star', 'voting', 'voted', 'way', 'DVD', 'movie', 'funny', 'am', 'happy', 'can', 'watch', 'when', 'have', 'free', 'time', 'Just', 'little', 'disappointed', 'what', 'offered', 'DVD']",N/A

Alessandra Prado, Alex Ariano and I visited Martha Oliva who is at home recuperating from foot problems and we brought her this DVD to watch as a group... the best medicine available...  for this movie is a rare treasure of endearing fun... which applies to any cross cultural relationships!!!The plot is simple, a young Greek woman, still living with her parents at the age of 30, under a domineering father who tells her she is ""looking old"" and not yet married, falls in love with a rather handsome University professor, who does not share her heritage, her sense of belonging to a large family, or her cultural identity.Toula Portokalos, played by Nia Vardalos, works as a waitress in her family's Greek restaurant, ""Dancing Zorba's"" and one day sees the handsome Ian Miller come in to meet one of his friends and she falls in love at first sight. She is entranced by his sight, he notices her, but she can not believe it possible.Toula is inspired to look for more out of life and enrolls in PC classes at the University, the dialogue of her parents as they decide whether a ""woman should be educated"" or not, is simply some of the funniest lines ever!!!As she excels at the required courses to run an efficient travel agency, Toula, with the help of her encouraging mother, convinces her aunt that she should go and work for her... They sit to tell the father... or was it the father's idea that she should go to work at the travel agency?The day Ian Miller, played by John Corbett, happens to walk by her place of employment provides some of the funniest clips of this film, which keeps you laughing from beginning to end!The couple begin an endearing romance, one that we thoroughly enjoy as it develops into a beautiful love affair. But... beware! The family finds out and the father is livid at this WASP [White Anglo Saxon Protestant] moving into Greek territory, something unheard of in the tradition of this lovely Greek family.As the families start to get to know one another, some of the scenes are so funny that we laugh to our hearts content. Being Cuban American, many of the scenes remind us of our own struggle to bring different cultures together as we have weaved the fabric of our families with many other cultural threads.During the film we admire the way Toula transforms from a quiet, introverted and shy person into a rather sophisticated young woman.

But I was pleasantly surprised!""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" is about an average-looking Greek woman named Toula (Nia Vardalos) who still lives with her family. Her family is Greek, Greek, Greek! Especially her dad, who follows Greek tradition to the book. Toula decides that she wants to do something with her life, therefore getting a job, which her dad reluctantly ""allows"" after some trickery from the women in the family. As Toula's dad says, Greek woman should ""marry Greek men, have Greek babies, and make Greek food"" until the day that they die (added by Toula, of course).Toula eventually meets a man who isn't Greek, but starts to fall in love with him anyways. (Yes, a bit cliche, but the movie pulls it off uniquely anyways, you'll have to see for yourself)It may not sound very interesting or very special, but ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" is a definite gem!

Nia Vardalos stars in a role she wrote for herself while working at SecondCity -  as Tula, a thirty-something Greek woman who has no life and desperately wants one. Her parents, meanwhile, want her to marry a nice Greek boy, have nice Greek children and cook until the day she dies, although she has different ideas.One day while working at her parent's restaurant, frumpy and miserable, she catches sight of Ian Miller, an English teacher, and instantly sees something in him. After the encounter, she wheedles her way into working at her aunt's travel agency, starts taking classes and gradually develops a social life and gets a (much needed) makeover. Shortly thereafter, Ian and Tula meet again, fall in love, he proposes, and there's only one more obstacle in the way of true love - her Big, Fat, Greek family!  Needless to say, they have some objections to her marrying a non-Greek (although the father eventually even finds a way of making Miller greek!) and trouble ensues. The antics of her family are often laugh-out-loud funny, plus there are absorbing characters and some great one-liners to boot.Rita Wilson and Tom Hanks decided to produce the film (Rita Wilson is herself Greek) and they obviously saw what everyone else is now seeing - a great family comedy that will almost wish you were Greek (if you aren't already!)",5,The Sleeper Hit of the Summer!,1030752000,"08 31, 2002",2002,1437,"['Nia', 'Vardalos', 'John', 'Corbett', 'star', 'heartwarming', 'comedy', 'love', 'marriage', '.family', 'Nia', 'Vardalos', 'stars', 'role', 'wrote', 'working', 'SecondCity', 'Tula', 'thirty-something', 'Greek', 'woman', 'who', 'life', 'desperately', 'one', 'parents', 'meanwhile', 'want', 'marry', 'nice', 'Greek', 'boy', 'have', 'nice', 'Greek', 'children', 'cook', 'day', 'different', 'ideas.One', 'day', 'working', 'parent', 'restaurant', 'frumpy', 'miserable', 'sight', 'Ian', 'Miller', 'English', 'teacher', 'instantly', 'something', 'encounter', 'way', 'working', 'aunt', 'travel', 'agency', 'taking', 'classes', 'gradually', 'social', 'life', 'much', 'needed', 'makeover', 'Shortly', 'thereafter', 'Ian', 'Tula', 'meet', 'again', 'fall', 'love', 'only', 'one', 'more', 'obstacle', 'way', 'true', 'love', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'family', 'Needless', 'say', 'have', 'objections', 'marrying', 'non-Greek', 'father', 'eventually', 'even', 'way', 'making', 'Miller', 'greek', 'trouble', 'ensues', 'antics', 'family', 'are', 'often', 'laugh-out-loud', 'funny', 'are', 'absorbing', 'characters', 'great', 'one-liners', 'boot.Rita', 'Wilson', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'decided', 'produce', 'film', 'Rita', 'Wilson', 'Greek', 'obviously', 'saw', 'what', 'everyone', 'else', 'now', 'seeing', 'great', 'family', 'comedy', 'will', 'almost', 'wish', 'were', 'Greek', 'are', ""n't"", 'already']",N/A

Dont believe other reviews that say that Greeks did not like the movie. On the contrary. The movie was an even bigger hit in Greece and everybody loved it.True, the stereotypes are overstretched and not completely accurate: Greeks dont use WINDEX as a general purpose medicine  -I dont know where that came from - and also Greeks strive for their childrens education (male or female). For example in Greece college students almost never support themselves but are rather fed by their parents until they finish their studies and find a job (in contrast to the U.S. college students that are mostly independent).But all these exaggerations dint bother me at all. The movie actually helped me realise that things and gestures that Greeks use to do , actualy seem very strange to people of different culture: Take for example the spitting in the head that is supposed to spell away the evil. Thats 100% a Greek gesture that only after seeing the movie I rationalized the fact of how ""crazy"" it looks. Or the consumption of all parts of a lamb -brain,tongue,eyes,intestines,testicles- that may look completely gross to Americans, are actually considered delicatessen in Greece.So overall a very very funny movie that Greeks actually enjoy and dont care about the stereotyping.Hey, when was the last time that Greeks have even been mentioned in a Holywood film ?",5,A review from a Greek guy!,1045180800,"02 14, 2003",2003,1441,"['was', 'born', 'raised', 'Greece', 'now', 'live', 'U.S.The', 'movie', 'was', 'funny', 'hell', 'Dont', 'believe', 'other', 'reviews', 'say', 'Greeks', 'did', 'not', 'movie', 'contrary', 'movie', 'was', 'even', 'bigger', 'hit', 'Greece', 'everybody', 'loved', 'it.True', 'stereotypes', 'are', 'overstretched', 'not', 'completely', 'accurate', 'Greeks', 'dont', 'use', 'WINDEX', 'general', 'purpose', 'medicine', '-I', 'dont', 'know', 'where', 'came', 'also', 'Greeks', 'strive', 'childrens', 'education', 'male', 'female', 'example', 'Greece', 'college', 'students', 'almost', 'never', 'support', 'are', 'rather', 'fed', 'parents', 'finish', 'studies', 'find', 'job', 'contrast', 'U.S.', 'college', 'students', 'are', 'mostly', 'independent', '.But', 'exaggerations', 'dint', 'movie', 'actually', 'helped', 'realise', 'things', 'gestures', 'Greeks', 'use', 'do', 'actualy', 'seem', 'very', 'strange', 'people', 'different', 'culture', 'Take', 'example', 'spitting', 'head', 'supposed', 'spell', 'away', 'evil', 'Thats', '100', '%', 'Greek', 'gesture', 'only', 'seeing', 'movie', 'rationalized', 'fact', 'how', 'crazy', 'consumption', 'parts', 'lamb', '-brain', 'tongue', 'eyes', 'intestines', 'testicles-', 'may', 'look', 'completely', 'gross', 'Americans', 'are', 'actually', 'considered', 'delicatessen', 'Greece.So', 'overall', 'very', 'very', 'funny', 'movie', 'Greeks', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'dont', 'care', 'stereotyping.Hey', 'when', 'was', 'last', 'time', 'Greeks', 'have', 'even', 'been', 'mentioned', 'Holywood', 'film']",N/A

The cast is expert; there are quite a few belly-laughs and chuckles aplenty; and the script is witty and plays with stereotypes without ever descending to mean-spiritedness.  But perhaps the single most likeable thing about GREEK WEDDING is the fact that the romantic leads look like real people instead of the Ken and Barbie actors so typically found in this sort of romantic comedy.  That is indeed a real joy, and I suspect it is at the heart of what has drawn so many to the film.I do indeed indeed recommend MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING.  But I also offer a slight caution: unless you are a die-hard romantic comedy fan, you might do better to rent the film before you actually go to the expense of purchasing it.  It is expertly done; it is charming; and I certainly look forward to seeing more from Nia Vardalos in the future.  But all that said, I found GREEK WEDDING extremely slight, and do not think I will revisit it in the future.  I found it enjoyable for an evening, but nothing more.

It is heart-warming, a slice of life that many people can identify with, showing reasonably normal people in recognizable situations - no cruelty, no nasty characters, no violence, no teenage-boy I-only-wish sex. Stereotypes? Oh, yes. The Greeks for sure, but also the boy (too good-looking, too sunny all the time), and his parents (too white-bread WASPy and unbelievably unsophisticated - the father is a lawyer and the son of a lawyer - please!). But they are all a welcome relief from the hard-as-nails vicious characters which populate most films and TV programs we see today. Besides, the extreme and often gratuitous violence which mars most dramas today represents a stereotype of its own and a much less pleasant one. In the end, and for me the ultimate test of any show, I felt much better after watching this movie than I had felt when I started watching it, and for that I am thankful.

I have to admit I learned a lot about Greek family today. Although I REALLY don't understand the spitting, I imagine that the Greeks are not too different from other races and ethnicities, all of whom have their quirks and customs, and all of whom have similar conflicts when one of their own marries an ""outsider"".Hopefully the reader would use common sense and make up their own mind, but as for me, I like this kind of movie. ""romantic comedy"", as opposed to the more derogatory term ""chick flick"", best describes this movie, and there are thankfully no blood and guts or shooting in this movie. It's a family movie about family, unlike ""Road To Perdition"", which I've tried my best to get out of my mind. Best of all, it shows that the studios don't have to hire overpriced bad actors with a sky's-the-limit budget to produce a decent movie that makes a profit.About the actors, I recognized two: Michael Constantine, who's been around forever, and Lainie Kazan, who plays the mother. I was later told that one of the members of a popular ""boy band"" has a part in the movie also. I don't keep up with the Top40 smut so I don't know. The stars of the movie are fairly unknown, at least to me, but I'm pleased to see that Greek actors don't have to disguise their names to get work, like they used to way back when. Power to them!About the movie's story, the part I liked best is the relationship between Tula and her kid brother. I loved how supportive he was of her and how he looked up to her. I found the mother-daughter dynamic interesting as well.

In order for a little film that no major studio picked up to rake in that kind of box office bucks, there has to be something to it, right? YES! There's quite a bit to it actually. I've seen just about every romantic comedy you can think of, so a unique one REALLY grabs me, and this one grabbed me and didn't let go! First, who is Nia Vardalos and why haven't we seen her before? She was FANTASTIC. I have to confess that I was expecting a hack acting job because I heard that this was her creation, so she clearly wasn't a seasoned actress. Not the case! Vardalos gives a convincing and endearing performance as Toulah, a frumpy Greek woman who is conspicuously lacking a man at 30, when most Greek girls have married and spawned at least a couple kids. Her parents, and the rest of her huge quirky family, also give great performances as overly-involved relatives who participate in every little aspect of Toulah's life. John Corbett is the love interest and the other main character in this film, and WOW, he is so perfect in this role. Not only is he adorable, he totally looks the part of a nice, sensitive, down-to-earth HS lit. teacher. As the story goes, Toulah is man-less, and therefore childless at the ripe old age of 30. Her parents are none to pleased with her progress to this end. Toulah works in her parents' Greek restaurant until she gets a yearning to do something different with her life. She winds up winning Dad's approval to go to college for computers, so she can work at her aunt's travel agency. Along with this major change, Toulah also dabbles with makeup and hairstyles to make herself more attractive, and to fit in, which is something she never did as a child. Toulah lands the job at her aunt's travel agency and this is where the Toulah-Ian (Corbett) romance buds, much to the dismay of Toulah's parents because Ian is not Greek. The culture clash that ensues lends much hilarity to the film. Ultimately, romance wins out, as you might imagine given the title, but the real story is not the wedding so much as the events leading up to it. This movie is fun to watch over and over.

Toula works in her families restaurant and as far as they know, she will be for the rest of her life.  They see her as an old maid and that she needs to get married soon or her life will be over.

I believe many consider Greeks the evolutionary equivalent of paramecia. But I am not here to bewail Greek ethnic suffering, but to praise ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"", a movie I took my fairly conservative but reasonable Greek parents to see. I honestly confess I laughed uproariously and continually throughout the movie. To non-Greeks, Toula's Greek universe may seem cartoonish, surreal, and even outrageously ""sitcommy"". Perhaps, but the exaggeration is only slight. I assure you the Greek beliefs, mannerisms, characteristics, and ideosyncrasies the game cast manifests on the screen do exist indeed. Tia Vardalos manages to satirize, lampoon, and skewer a vast variety of Greek life elements. Yet, she is not vicious, mean-spirited, or self-loathing.

As the clich&eacute; goes, I laughed a lot with recognition and cried a little with recognition.It is pointless to rehash the admittedly derivative plot: it's a pastiche (this is the Greek word for ""casserole"" by the way, as Toulas irascible father would say) of ""Romeo and Juliet"", ""Father of the Bride"", ""Only the Lonely"" and every ""ugly duckling"", ""coming of age"", ""class warfare"" and ""crazy ethnic"" movie you can conceive. But who cares? The movie is achingly funny, people, for both Greeks and non-Greeks. I would recommend all families - ESPECIALLY Greek families- to see this hilarious farce. They will be pleasantly shocked by how true to Greek life it gets. ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" serves as a concise but comprehensive primer to Greeks in general. If you're not careful, you may learn something about us kooky, overlooked Greeks.Not once was I bored with this delightful movie. No one is an irredeemable villain in this movie, not even the obvious target of the chauvinistic patriarch, who only really wants his family to be happy. Everybody is flawed, but everybody also has their worth. Each actor/actress in the film was an unfettered joy to behold, and contributes admirably to the overall effect of a wonderful slice of precious ethnicity.Apart from two anatomy jokes a couple of Greek cousins trick Ian Miller, Toula's beau, into uttering in Greek, the movie is not profane, depraved, or crude. This is a family movie in every sense of the world.  It's safe to bring the kids.My commentary could easily extend into a surgical dissertation of every joke, character, plot device, and theme this celluloid cornucopia abundantly provides. But I will conclude with a paraphrasing of the theme the Greek patriach (Michael Constantine - a real Greek) hilariously and touchingly enunciates: The world is more than a melting pot. It is a fruit basket where apples (Millers) and oranges (Portokaloses) must and can happily live together with warmth, mutual respect, and happiness.Yes, I bought the DVD.P.S.: I almost forgot; my parents loved the movie too, though they were still a bit disappointed about Greeks marrying ""xeni (non-Greek stranger)"", though they admit that it is all but inevitable. In fact, my mom thought the ""xenos"" elements was even a bit dated; more and more, Greeks are marrying non-Greeks.",4,My Big Fat Greek Wedding Laughs :D :D :D,1304035200,"04 29, 2011",2011,3753,"['name', 'John', 'Panagopoulos.Yes', 'last', 'name', 'Greek', 'am', 'Greek', 'Greek', 'Orthodox', 'be', 'exact.Yeah', 'name', 'long', 'many', 'Greek', 'surnames', 'are', 'quite', 'longer', 'not', 'hard', 'pronounce.Parse', 'syllables', 'say', 'slowly', '.Pa', 'na', 'gop', 'hard', 'g', 'gus', 'ou', 'los.Now', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'difficult', 'was', 'many', 'other', 'ethnic', 'groups', 'Greeks', 'have', 'endured', 'slings', 'brickbats', 'outrageous', 'prejudice', 'stereotyping', 'even', 'general', 'indifference', 'believe', 'many', 'consider', 'Greeks', 'evolutionary', 'equivalent', 'paramecia', 'am', 'not', 'here', 'bewail', 'Greek', 'ethnic', 'suffering', 'praise', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'Wedding', 'movie', 'took', 'fairly', 'conservative', 'reasonable', 'Greek', 'parents', 'see', 'honestly', 'confess', 'laughed', 'uproariously', 'continually', 'movie', 'non-Greeks', 'Toula', 'Greek', 'universe', 'may', 'seem', 'cartoonish', 'surreal', 'even', 'outrageously', 'sitcommy', 'Perhaps', 'exaggeration', 'only', 'slight', 'assure', 'Greek', 'beliefs', 'mannerisms', 'characteristics', 'game', 'cast', 'manifests', 'screen', 'do', 'exist', 'indeed', 'Tia', 'Vardalos', 'satirize', 'lampoon', 'skewer', 'vast', 'variety', 'Greek', 'life', 'elements', 'not', 'vicious', 'mean-spirited', 'self-loathing', 'guffaws', 'frenetic', 'pacing', 'boisterous', 'interaction', 'huge', 'cast', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'Wedding', 'graciously', 'generously', 'sweet', 'heart', 'humanity', 'extended', 'exasperating', 'family', 'clich', 'eacute', 'laughed', 'lot', 'recognition', 'cried', 'little', 'recognition.It', 'pointless', 'rehash', 'admittedly', 'derivative', 'plot', 'pastiche', 'Greek', 'word', 'casserole', 'way', 'Toulas', 'irascible', 'father', 'would', 'say', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'Father', 'Bride', 'Only', 'Lonely', 'ugly', 'duckling', 'coming', 'age', 'class', 'warfare', 'crazy', 'ethnic', 'movie', 'can', 'conceive', 'who', 'movie', 'achingly', 'funny', 'people', 'Greeks', 'non-Greeks', 'would', 'recommend', 'families', 'ESPECIALLY', 'Greek', 'families-', 'see', 'hilarious', 'farce', 'will', 'be', 'pleasantly', 'shocked', 'how', 'true', 'Greek', 'life', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'Wedding', 'concise', 'comprehensive', 'primer', 'Greeks', 'general', ""'re"", 'not', 'careful', 'may', 'learn', 'something', 'kooky', 'overlooked', 'Greeks.Not', 'once', 'was', 'bored', 'delightful', 'movie', 'one', 'irredeemable', 'villain', 'movie', 'not', 'even', 'obvious', 'target', 'chauvinistic', 'patriarch', 'who', 'only', 'really', 'family', 'be', 'happy', 'Everybody', 'flawed', 'everybody', 'also', 'worth', 'actor/actress', 'film', 'was', 'unfettered', 'joy', 'behold', 'admirably', 'overall', 'effect', 'wonderful', 'slice', 'precious', 'ethnicity.Apart', 'two', 'anatomy', 'jokes', 'couple', 'Greek', 'cousins', 'trick', 'Ian', 'Miller', 'Toula', 'beau', 'uttering', 'Greek', 'movie', 'not', 'profane', 'depraved', 'crude', 'family', 'movie', 'sense', 'world', 'safe', 'bring', 'kids.My', 'commentary', 'could', 'easily', 'extend', 'surgical', 'dissertation', 'joke', 'character', 'plot', 'device', 'theme', 'celluloid', 'cornucopia', 'abundantly', 'will', 'conclude', 'paraphrasing', 'theme', 'Greek', 'patriach', 'Michael', 'Constantine', 'real', 'Greek', 'hilariously', 'touchingly', 'enunciates', 'world', 'more', 'melting', 'pot', 'fruit', 'basket', 'where', 'apples', 'Millers', 'oranges', 'Portokaloses', 'must', 'can', 'happily', 'live', 'together', 'warmth', 'mutual', 'respect', 'happiness.Yes', 'bought', 'DVD.P.S', 'almost', 'forgot', 'parents', 'loved', 'movie', 'too', 'were', 'still', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'Greeks', 'marrying', 'xeni', 'non-Greek', 'stranger', 'admit', 'inevitable', 'fact', 'mom', 'thought', 'xenos', 'elements', 'was', 'even', 'bit', 'dated', 'more', 'more', 'Greeks', 'are', 'marrying', 'non-Greeks']",N/A

I knew a Greek family much like the one in the movie and the patriach of the family was a carbon copy of Gus in the movie, even down to explaining how all words have Greek roots. The story is all about family and boy do the Greeks have families! Loving, caring, meddling, protective families! In this story, Toula, the daughter of the family is 30 and unmarried, a situation that distresses her dear father. Toula works at the family restaurant, Dancing Zorbas, and while doing so, with no help from her father is somewhat smitten by a WASPy hunk who happens in for coffee with a friend. Ian Miller is not Greek. He is the farthest thing you can think of from Greek and over time as the two fall inexorably in love you can imagine the strains the relationship will put on both families, especially hers. You know they will marry and that all will work out in the end. This story is not about disappointment.

714612,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B00006FMUW,Joseph Haschka,"[17, 23]","""America the melting pot"" is a worn out clich&eacute;, but its tiresomeness doesn't detract from the fact that MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING is an amusing and appealing tale of the process in action.Nia Vardalos wrote the play on which this film version is based, in which she stars as Toula Portokalos, the 30 year old unmarried daughter of restaurateur Gus Portokalos (Michael Constantine). Toula is a frumpy, bespectacled ""seating hostess"" in her father's Chicago establishment. Though the life cycle of a Greek girl is to marry a Greek boy, have lots of Greek kids, and spend her life feeding an extended Greek family, Gus is beginning to doubt Toula's ability to pull this off - particularly the first bit. Realizing she doesn't have a life, Toula connives with her mother Maria (Lainie Kazan) to land a job in her aunt's travel agency. Now, out in the real world - with the help of a cosmetic and fashion makeover - she meets and falls in love with high school teacher Ian Miller (John Corbett). Ian is decidedly not Greek. He's the only son of affluent, coldly reserved, WASP parents. The film's comedic plot revolves around the awkwardness resulting from the collision of two very different cultures during the course of Ian and Toula's BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING. For example, when the elder Millers pull up in front of the Portokalos house for an initial get-acquainted get-together, they're appalled to see the entire Portokalos clan - Toula has 27 first cousins - roasting an animal carcass in the front yard. Did I mention that the Millers are vegetarians?I never felt the same affinity and sympathy for Gus and his family as I did for Lalit Verma and his family in MONSOON WEDDING, a splendid Indian film that is driven more by character development than by comic situations. Perhaps it was also because Lalit was coping with some very real predicaments, while Gus's problems are of his own mind's making. However, MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING still works because the people seem very real. Toula and Ian are attractive in a reasonable, but not intimidating, way. (This isn't a cutely tousled Meg Ryan meets a handsomely charming Tom Hanks soap opera.) Ms. Kazan is terrific as the ""family neck"" which can turn the obstinate ""family head"" (Gus) in any way that she pleases. Both movies stress the value of large-family relationships, something long forgotten by the miniscule, Nuclear Age American families of WASP heritage that strive for independence from tribal obligations.Oh, and I have to believe the makers of Windex forked over some big bucks to support this film's production.

So many people I know - critics included - had poo-poohed the film as too silly and slow, or simply unworthy of the hype that surrounds it.  And though I'd gotten a few good reviews from friends, I never expected to laugh as much as I actually did, or even cry the couple of times I ended up doing so.This is a warm, sweet-as-apple-pie film, certain to warm the coldest hearts in your living rooms.

Aside from the romantic sparks between Vardalos and Corbett, anyone with a diverse and crazy family will appreciate the hysterical plot and zippy dialogue taken from some of life's most precious moments.

Because she loves her family and her WASP professor, Toula's able to let us see the humorous side of all them, and herself, without being mean.That may the movie's greatest seller of all, that it manages to be funny without being hurtful or crude. In this age when even the people at Disney seem to think that bodily functions are funny (I thought every kid over the age of 8 was supposed to have outgrown that) this movie is refreshing.The other refreshing part was that this was a movie about people willing to make sacrifices for the people they love. Ultimately, that is what families that work do for each other, and in this movie almost everyone gives up something for the benefit of other people in the family. Toula's parents must give up some of their prejudice; so must her fiance's parents. Her fiance joins the Greek church and is dunked for his baptismal so that Toula's parents can at least have their Greek wedding. Toula must give up, among other things, self-pity and self-loathing to allow herself to be loved.I suppose there may be people in this country who have not been subjected to family pressures. Those ten people shouldn't buy this.Now, about the DVD. You get both wide-screen and full-screen in the set. YES!

Unless you like seeing Tom Cruise, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, or Harrison Ford all in what is essentially the same spy movie, with explosions and guys falling off buildings.Nia Vardalos, star and writer, presents her self as she is, ethnically beautiful but not starlet-pretty, which plays a major role in her character's self-image.The theme is universal and we care about the characters. Excellent performances by the two of the best character actors in the business, Lainie Kazan (who looks so much like Nia Vardalos) and Michael Constantine. John Corbett is, as always, John Corbett, a fine and subtle actor.Ms. Vardalos put together a package whose backers included IFC / Independent Film Channel, HBO, Joel Zwick, and Mr. and Mrs. Tom Hanks. (Tom, by the way, is in the only Hollywood movie worth seeing, a terrific movie, ROAD TO PERDITION.)Some emigrants to America held onto their European culture at all costs. This movie depicts such a family. But like many, the next generation is more open to new ideas. AMERICAN RHAPSODY had such a theme.

714639,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00006FMUW,Lawyeraau,"[0, 0]","This is a warmly funny, down to earth, one note comedy in which I was somewhat disappointed. The reality of it simply did not live up to its media hype. Still, I found this fairly formulaic, romantic comedy to be enjoyable, light-hearted fare to be taken at face value.The film centers around Toula Portokalos (Nia Vardalos), who comes from a fiercely ethno-centric, clannish, Greek family whose Greekness is the end-all, be-all of their lives. Toula is an over thirty, plain Jane, who lives at home with her overly protective mother, Maria (Lainie Kazan), and father, Gus (Michael Constantine), as well as her brother, Nick (Louis Mandylor). She works in her family's coffee shop where she seems to be sleep-walking through life. One day a handsome man, Ian Miller (John Corbett), enters the coffee shop with a friend, and she is smitten. Shortly thereafter, Toula embarks on a life changing course.She takes college courses. She undergoes a complete physical makeover, from the way she dresses to the way she carries herself. She even changes jobs, working at her aunt's travel agency. There, she chances to see her dream man again. They meet. They date. They fall in love. She does all this behind her family's back, as Ian is not Greek. When her family finds out, all hell breaks loose, as her parents parade a host of Greek losers for Toula in hopes that she will not break with tradition.Needless to say, Toula and Ian stick together despite family opposition, hers and his. His family finds her family appalling. Her family finds his family strait-laced and humorless. Never the twain shall meet. Still, the marriage will go on, and Toula's family completely commandeers the wedding, as they will have it done no other way than their way, that is to say, the Greek way. There are many funny, priceless moments throughout the film. Gus, the father, is particularly funny with his belief that all words are of Greek origin and his belief that a spritz of Windex will cure anything. Maria, the mother, also has her zany moments.Nia Vardalos, who is Greek, wrote the script, and she is right on the money. Living in New York, I have had many Greek friends over the years, and many Greeks of the older generation are as ethno-centric as those portrayed in the movie. There was a ring of truth in many of the jokes that hit home. As an actress, however, she leaves a lot to be desired. I found her to be unappealing and somewhat wooden in the role of Toula.The film is an over-hyped, cute, one note comedy that will not prevail over time. The film was recently put to the test when it became a sit-com of the same name with the original movie cast, with the exception of John Corbett (who had his own series ""Lucky""). Needless to say, the sit-com did not last out the season. One note comedies rarely do. Still, this film is worth a rental, as it will certainly provide some laughs.",3,IT'S GREEK TO ME...,1149292800,"06 3, 2006",2006,2883,"['warmly', 'funny', 'down', 'earth', 'one', 'note', 'comedy', 'was', 'somewhat', 'disappointed', 'reality', 'simply', 'did', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'media', 'hype', 'Still', 'found', 'fairly', 'formulaic', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'light-hearted', 'fare', 'be', 'taken', 'face', 'value.The', 'film', 'centers', 'Toula', 'Portokalos', 'Nia', 'Vardalos', 'who', 'fiercely', 'ethno-centric', 'clannish', 'Greek', 'family', 'Greekness', 'end-all', 'be-all', 'lives', 'Toula', 'thirty', 'plain', 'Jane', 'who', 'home', 'overly', 'protective', 'mother', 'Maria', 'Lainie', 'Kazan', 'father', 'Gus', 'Michael', 'Constantine', 'as', 'well', 'brother', 'Nick', 'Louis', 'Mandylor', 'family', 'coffee', 'shop', 'where', 'be', 'sleep-walking', 'life', 'One', 'day', 'handsome', 'man', 'Ian', 'Miller', 'John', 'Corbett', 'coffee', 'shop', 'friend', 'smitten', 'Shortly', 'thereafter', 'Toula', 'life', 'changing', 'course.She', 'college', 'courses', 'complete', 'physical', 'makeover', 'way', 'way', 'even', 'changes', 'jobs', 'working', 'aunt', 'travel', 'agency', 'see', 'dream', 'man', 'again', 'meet', 'date', 'fall', 'love', 'family', 'back', 'Ian', 'not', 'Greek', 'When', 'family', 'out', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose', 'parents', 'parade', 'host', 'Greek', 'losers', 'Toula', 'hopes', 'will', 'not', 'break', 'tradition.Needless', 'say', 'Toula', 'Ian', 'stick', 'together', 'family', 'opposition', 'hers', 'family', 'family', 'appalling', 'family', 'family', 'strait-laced', 'humorless', 'twain', 'shall', 'meet', 'Still', 'marriage', 'will', 'go', 'Toula', 'family', 'completely', 'wedding', 'will', 'have', 'done', 'other', 'way', 'way', 'say', 'Greek', 'way', 'are', 'many', 'funny', 'priceless', 'moments', 'film', 'Gus', 'father', 'particularly', 'funny', 'belief', 'words', 'are', 'Greek', 'origin', 'belief', 'spritz', 'Windex', 'will', 'cure', 'anything', 'Maria', 'mother', 'also', 'zany', 'moments.Nia', 'Vardalos', 'who', 'Greek', 'wrote', 'script', 'right', 'money', 'Living', 'New', 'York', 'have', 'had', 'many', 'Greek', 'friends', 'years', 'many', 'Greeks', 'older', 'generation', 'are', 'as', 'ethno-centric', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'was', 'ring', 'truth', 'many', 'jokes', 'hit', 'home', 'actress', 'however', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'found', 'be', 'unappealing', 'somewhat', 'wooden', 'role', 'Toula.The', 'film', 'over-hyped', 'cute', 'one', 'note', 'comedy', 'will', 'not', 'prevail', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'recently', 'put', 'test', 'when', 'became', 'sit-com', 'same', 'name', 'original', 'movie', 'cast', 'exception', 'John', 'Corbett', 'who', 'had', 'own', 'series', 'Lucky', 'Needless', 'say', 'sit-com', 'did', 'not', 'last', 'season', 'One', 'note', 'comedies', 'rarely', 'do', 'Still', 'film', 'rental', 'will', 'certainly', 'provide', 'laughs']",N/A

714645,A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,B00006FMUW,"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy""","[28, 31]","What a terrific movie.  Very funny, very warm.  A superb ensemble cast, a great script, and excellent pacing make this a real winner.The mix of cultures is very well done--not, as some reviewers have said, tritely at all.  John Corbett's ultra WASPy Ian Miller is a perfect foil for Nia Vardalos' ultra Greek Toula who, at the age of six, was the only girl in her school who was swarthy with sideburns.  She's smart, attractive, and most of all full of innocent charm which is a huge plus in these days of Hollywood bombast.The culture mix is upped several notches when Ian's SUPER-ultra WASPy conservative, reigned-in parents come to Toula's house for a ""quiet dinner"" which turns out to be an uproar attended by no less than about 25 people--Toula's family, of course, invited by her parents.  It's great to see the uptight Millers consume mass quantities of ouzo, encouraged by their host's entreaties, and the resulting discombobulation.Innocence, in fact, is everywhere in this film and gives it the tremendous charm and warmth it has.  Confusing innocence for triteness is a huge mistake.  Here, both leads radiate the innocence of pure romance which is very moving, and the romance is beautifully balanced with a lot of very funny moments.Toula's father, played by Michael Constantine (a Greek), is constantly lecturing his family on how Greek is the language of origin of ALL words--even kimono--and applying Windex to EVERY pain or hurt a human being can experience.  He can be a grump, but it's obvious he has real heart.  His mother comes directly from Greece to stay with the family and is the source of some truly inspired hilarity.Does the couple meet cute?  Depends on how you define that.  The real answer is, No, they don't; they meet normally, like two people might realistically meet.Toula's mother is played by Lainie Kazan, a veteran (like Constantine) who portrays the correct balance of smartmouth and sentiment in her character.  Also notable is Anrea Martin, a Second City TV alumna, as Toula's aunt.Nia Vardalos, Toula, also wrote the film and did a great job as both lead actress and writer.Highly recommended.",4,"Greeks, grins, grumps, and grannies--great!",1026604800,"07 14, 2002",2002,2137,"['What', 'terrific', 'movie', 'Very', 'funny', 'very', 'warm', 'superb', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'great', 'script', 'excellent', 'pacing', 'make', 'real', 'winner.The', 'mix', 'cultures', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'not', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'tritely', 'John', 'Corbett', 'ultra', 'WASPy', 'Ian', 'Miller', 'perfect', 'foil', 'Nia', 'Vardalos', 'ultra', 'Greek', 'Toula', 'who', 'age', 'six', 'was', 'only', 'girl', 'school', 'who', 'was', 'swarthy', 'sideburns', 'smart', 'attractive', 'most', 'full', 'innocent', 'charm', 'huge', 'plus', 'days', 'Hollywood', 'bombast.The', 'culture', 'mix', 'upped', 'several', 'notches', 'when', 'Ian', 'SUPER-ultra', 'WASPy', 'conservative', 'reigned-in', 'parents', 'come', 'Toula', 'house', 'quiet', 'dinner', 'out', 'be', 'uproar', 'attended', 'less', 'about', '25', 'people', 'Toula', 'family', 'course', 'invited', 'parents', 'great', 'see', 'uptight', 'Millers', 'consume', 'mass', 'quantities', 'ouzo', 'encouraged', 'host', 'entreaties', 'resulting', 'discombobulation.Innocence', 'fact', 'everywhere', 'film', 'tremendous', 'charm', 'warmth', 'Confusing', 'innocence', 'triteness', 'huge', 'mistake', 'Here', 'leads', 'radiate', 'innocence', 'pure', 'romance', 'very', 'moving', 'romance', 'beautifully', 'balanced', 'lot', 'very', 'funny', 'moments.Toula', 'father', 'played', 'Michael', 'Constantine', 'Greek', 'constantly', 'lecturing', 'family', 'how', 'Greek', 'language', 'origin', 'ALL', 'words', 'even', 'kimono', 'applying', 'Windex', 'EVERY', 'pain', 'hurt', 'human', 'being', 'can', 'experience', 'can', 'be', 'grump', 'obvious', 'real', 'heart', 'mother', 'directly', 'Greece', 'stay', 'family', 'source', 'truly', 'inspired', 'hilarity.Does', 'couple', 'meet', 'cute', 'how', 'define', 'real', 'answer', 'No', 'do', ""n't"", 'meet', 'normally', 'two', 'people', 'might', 'realistically', 'meet.Toula', 'mother', 'played', 'Lainie', 'Kazan', 'veteran', 'Constantine', 'who', 'correct', 'balance', 'smartmouth', 'sentiment', 'character', 'Also', 'notable', 'Anrea', 'Martin', 'Second', 'City', 'TV', 'alumna', 'Toula', 'aunt.Nia', 'Vardalos', 'Toula', 'also', 'wrote', 'film', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'lead', 'actress', 'writer.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

She lives at home and works in the family restaurant, Dancing Zorba. Both her aunt (Angela Martin) and her mother (Lanie Kazan)are flamboyant women making vats of food. Michael Constantine is a stand-out as the father who believes that any cut can be treated with Windex (I thought it was very funny that no matter where you looked in the house, there was a bottle of Windex lurking somewhere). And then, out of the blue, into Toula's life comes Ian Miller, a sort of lite Kevin Sorbo. In time, she bucks her father's resistance and takes a computer class at a nearby college, and before you know it, in go the contact lenses and on come the lots more attractive wardrobe, so that the next time she sees that Ian guy, she's prepared.

However, the stereotype, while extreme, is within the realm of truth.  Having been involved deeply with people from other countries, I have observed that quite often they see everything in terms of their own nation.  What Gus Portokalos has on his garage door is hilarious, as one example.Toula is 30 years old, and single; a near death sentence in her Greek family where woman are expected to marry young, feed everyone, and make more Greek babies (according to Toula).  While working as a ""seating hostess"" in her father's restaurant, she meets Ian Miller, played by John Corbett.  The sparks begin to fly almost immediately.  After several creative scenes, Ian and Toula finally date, and quickly grow to love each other.Toula's family is a riot.  Because her family is very large, and very close, her extended family includes dozens of members.  The two characters that stood out in my mind are Michael Constantine as Gus Portokalos, and Andrea Martin (of the long-defunct SCTV) as Aunt Voula.  You may recognize other actors, but virtually every scene with Aunt Voula was funny, and Gus Portokalos as the supposed head of the family was easily manipulated by the real heads of the family, the women, making many of his scenes very funny.This movie is not the slapstick buffoonery we see in other contemporary comedies such as those by Eddie Murphy.  Here the humor is the contrast between the too pure-white, upper middle class, and small family of Ian Miller and the richly patriotic, ethnically cohesive, and large family of Toula Portokalos.  Toula's huge and relatively bizarre family overwhelms the Millers.  For example, the Portokalos hold an outdoor barbecue on their front lawn with hundreds of people.  ""Whatever would the neighbors think"" would be the typical reaction of many people in many middle class neighborhoods.  The Portokalos interpret (or try) everything the Millers do by their own standard.  Both families are clueless regarding the other and our objective view of both families give us the opportunity to find the humor in how little each knows about the other.Ian finds Toula to be interesting.  Similarly, Toula finds something about Ian interesting.  Each feels that the other offers something different.  That differences are multiple, in terms of lifestyle, personality and expectations.  The viewer should not expect Toula to become Cinderella.  She does not and can not, and Ian is not looking for Cinderella.  In fact, Ian may be looking for non-Cinderella.  Regardless, she is Ian's princess, and that's what truly counts.I particularly enjoyed the ending of the movie.  There is a point as the movie nears the end where we realize that while the differences between the families and the lifestyles are large, ultimately both families have common interests.  For me that key moment pulled the whole movie together, explaining that the point of the movie, after highlighting the differences between the characters and their families, was that we all pretty much want and like the same or similar things.  Because I was personally touched by this moment, I'll let the viewers see for themselves what that moment might be, which may be different for them.This movie is not a wildly hilarious slapstick comedy.  Instead, its humor is unabashedly ethnic-based.  However, its stereotypes are not generally derogatory, any more so than those of say, ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"" with Chevy Chase.  But this movie will make you smile, and the touching moments will make you feel good.  An intelligent movie that relies on simple story-telling, this movie deserved the accolades it received, and earns a 5-star rating.",5,Intelligent and Humorous,1144454400,"04 8, 2006",2006,4067,"['harder', 'harder', 'film', 'industry', 'come', 'up', 'something', 'original', 'many', 'cases', 'can', 'point', 'film', 'list', 'multiple', 'movies', 'same', 'genre', 'often', 'current', 'movie', 'direct', 'remake', 'thinly', 'veiled', 'remake', 'Not', 'so', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'Wedding', 'Nia', 'Vardalos', 'Toula', 'Portokalos', 'rather', 'frumpy', 'Greek-American', 'family', 'somewhat', 'stereotypical', 'However', 'stereotype', 'extreme', 'realm', 'truth', 'Having', 'been', 'involved', 'deeply', 'people', 'other', 'countries', 'have', 'observed', 'quite', 'often', 'see', 'everything', 'terms', 'own', 'nation', 'What', 'Gus', 'Portokalos', 'garage', 'door', 'hilarious', 'one', 'example.Toula', '30', 'years', 'old', 'single', 'near', 'death', 'sentence', 'Greek', 'family', 'where', 'woman', 'are', 'expected', 'marry', 'young', 'feed', 'everyone', 'make', 'more', 'Greek', 'babies', 'according', 'Toula', 'working', 'seating', 'hostess', 'father', 'restaurant', 'Ian', 'Miller', 'played', 'John', 'Corbett', 'sparks', 'begin', 'fly', 'almost', 'immediately', 'several', 'creative', 'scenes', 'Ian', 'Toula', 'finally', 'date', 'quickly', 'grow', 'love', 'other.Toula', 'family', 'riot', 'family', 'very', 'large', 'very', 'close', 'extended', 'family', 'dozens', 'members', 'two', 'characters', 'stood', 'out', 'mind', 'are', 'Michael', 'Constantine', 'Gus', 'Portokalos', 'Andrea', 'Martin', 'long-defunct', 'SCTV', 'Aunt', 'Voula', 'may', 'recognize', 'other', 'actors', 'virtually', 'scene', 'Aunt', 'Voula', 'was', 'funny', 'Gus', 'Portokalos', 'supposed', 'head', 'family', 'was', 'easily', 'manipulated', 'real', 'heads', 'family', 'women', 'making', 'many', 'scenes', 'very', 'funny.This', 'movie', 'not', 'slapstick', 'buffoonery', 'see', 'other', 'contemporary', 'comedies', 'such', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'Here', 'humor', 'contrast', 'too', 'pure-white', 'upper', 'middle', 'class', 'small', 'family', 'Ian', 'Miller', 'richly', 'patriotic', 'ethnically', 'cohesive', 'large', 'family', 'Toula', 'Portokalos', 'Toula', 'huge', 'relatively', 'bizarre', 'family', 'Millers', 'example', 'Portokalos', 'hold', 'outdoor', 'barbecue', 'front', 'lawn', 'hundreds', 'people', 'would', 'neighbors', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'typical', 'reaction', 'many', 'people', 'many', 'middle', 'class', 'neighborhoods', 'Portokalos', 'interpret', 'try', 'everything', 'Millers', 'do', 'own', 'standard', 'families', 'are', 'clueless', 'regarding', 'other', 'objective', 'view', 'families', 'give', 'opportunity', 'find', 'humor', 'how', 'little', 'other.Ian', 'Toula', 'be', 'interesting', 'Similarly', 'Toula', 'something', 'Ian', 'interesting', 'feels', 'other', 'offers', 'something', 'different', 'differences', 'are', 'multiple', 'terms', 'lifestyle', 'personality', 'expectations', 'viewer', 'should', 'not', 'expect', 'Toula', 'become', 'Cinderella', 'not', 'can', 'not', 'Ian', 'not', 'looking', 'Cinderella', 'fact', 'Ian', 'may', 'be', 'looking', 'non-Cinderella', 'Regardless', 'Ian', 'princess', 'what', 'truly', 'counts.I', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'ending', 'movie', 'point', 'movie', 'end', 'where', 'realize', 'differences', 'families', 'lifestyles', 'are', 'large', 'ultimately', 'families', 'have', 'common', 'interests', 'key', 'moment', 'pulled', 'whole', 'movie', 'together', 'explaining', 'point', 'movie', 'highlighting', 'differences', 'characters', 'families', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'want', 'same', 'similar', 'things', 'was', 'personally', 'touched', 'moment', ""'ll"", 'let', 'viewers', 'see', 'what', 'moment', 'might', 'be', 'may', 'be', 'different', 'them.This', 'movie', 'not', 'wildly', 'hilarious', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'Instead', 'humor', 'unabashedly', 'ethnic-based', 'However', 'stereotypes', 'are', 'not', 'generally', 'derogatory', 'more', 'so', 'say', 'National', 'Lampoon', 'Christmas', 'Vacation', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'smile', 'touching', 'moments', 'will', 'make', 'feel', 'good', 'intelligent', 'movie', 'simple', 'story-telling', 'movie', 'deserved', 'accolades', 'received', '5-star', 'rating']",N/A

Graham ""yose""","[5, 6]","I can't imagine how anyone would sit down to watch this film would do so with the expectation of serious &quot;conflict&quot;, serious consequences, or, for that matter, ANYTHING other than pure entertainment. And THAT, my friends, MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING has in abundance. I don't know whether or not the family is exaggerated, but I DO know that they reminded me of my next door neighbors-- people who always invite us over when they are having a party or barbeque or whatever and always look out for us because, as they always tell us, &quot;You're FAMILY.&quot; My husband and I are white and our neighbors are Mexican. Am I making my point here? I did not find Toula's family abrasive in the least because there was not a mean-spirited bone to be had in ANY of them-- just a lot of love. How many families can be that demonstrative and involved with one another? This is a BAD thing? And as for Toula's &quot;transformation,&quot; one reviewer complained that it seemed to happen overnight, which leads me to think (a) the reviewer missed the scenes where she tries makeup, goes to class, changes her hair, goes to class, starts making friends in class, gets contacts, etc. or (b) wanted something to complain about. As for Ian's parents, yes, many people ARE that tight-assed (pardon my French), and yes, alcohol CAN transform them into fun people. But enough about my mother;-)! Bottom line? This is a happy movie, a JOYFUL movie, and THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT! The ONLY reasons I gave it 4 stars were (a) a lack of extras on the DVD (only a commentary track; what, no behind-the-scenes, perhaps footage of her one-woman show, mini docu about her family/Greek families in general etc. etc.?) and (b) the fact that IS light entertainment, not a classic by any means, which is pretty much what I reserve the 5 stars for. I think it was Roger Ebert who uses the criterion of &quot;What is the movie trying to do/say, and how well does it do/say it?&quot; What does the movie ASPIRE to be, and does it accomplish it?  MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING aspires to be a nice, happy movie, and it does it by having characters we care about and dialogue that doesn't insult our intelligence.

From a biographical original screenplay by Nia Vardalos, who plays herself in the film, as Toulah, the ugly duckling daughter of a boisterous Greek family, Wilson got the film made with an original limited release to only a few screens in major cities.  Audience reaction caused the studio to think again, and remarket it to all theaters.  MBFGW will be one of the few films that survives the whole summer on the big screen.Vardalos has crafted a plot and sight and sound gags that keep you chuckling throughout the film.  Add to the mix John Corbett, every woman in America's dream man since he played Aidan in ""Sex and the City"", and you've got a winner.I was exceptionally happy to see the wonderful Michael Constantine and Laine Kazan, small screen performers of old, in terrific new roles, and terrifically funny!  Andrea Martin - the zany alumnus of Saturday Night Live, gets lots of laughs as the crazy aunt.

714662,ASU3THM5ZUTUI,B00006FMUW,"Mark Lee ""Peacemaker""","[2, 2]","First of all, if you need me to write a plot summary for this film, click the Back button right now.  ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" was made on a budget of $$ million, and it grossed over $$ million worldwide; in fact, it's not only the surprise box office smash of 2002, it's actually the highest-grossing independent film of all time.  Now I'm definitely not Greek, and romantic comedies are almost never at the top of my ""must-see list"".  However, I *am* a reviewer of independent films, so naturally this statistic was simply too outrageous for me to ignore.Directed by Joel Zwick and produced by (gasp!) Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson, this is a cute and generally entertaining film.  The storyline is both familiar and predictable, and the humor is more amusing than hilarious.  However, the film's major strength (and probably the main reason why it became so popular) is the array of likeable characters with exaggerated stereotypes, combined with the eccentric cast that brings the caricatures to life.  To start off the film, the protagonist Toula (Nia Vardalos) gives a humorous voice-over narration to introduce the audience to her huge and boisterous family.  In the next few minutes, virtually all the relatives-from Toula's obstinate father, to her raucous cousins, to her industrious older sister-are given a garden variety of adorable quirks and one-liners that still remain fresh in the viewer's mind, even when the plot has progressed further.  Later, the sharp contrast between Toula's family and that of her fianc&eacute; Ian (John Corbett) adds another charming touch to the film.The film then offers several good laughs involving Michael trying to adjust to the Greek family, and of Toula trying to detach herself from her father's harsh policies.  However, after a certain point (most noticeably after the ""engagement party"" scene), the film begins to recycle its gags based on the same one-joke premise.  The jokes were still amusing, as they continued to overstress the characters' personalities, but they just weren't as funny the second or third time around.  One particular scene involving the intoxication of Ian's parents struck me as being both hackneyed and corny, but fortunately that's the only really lowbrow point in the film.Of course the film doesn't try to pull any tricks, and the comedic pinnacle is saved for the wedding day.  Unfortunately, this scene didn't come off as being downright hilarious like it should've been, considering that it's supposed to be the big moment everyone's waiting for.  It does, however, unite both families and bring out the memorable aspects of the characters, and it provides a handy stepping stool for the film's ""happily ever after"" ending.Ultimately, this film wasn't as subtle with its humor as I hoped it would be, seeing that it was so unbelievably popular.  Nor did it attempt to tell jokes on a different basis the way I expected it would.  Still, it was a pleasant little diversion with endearing characters to whom I was sorry to say goodbye.

Thirty years old and unmarried, Toula Portokalos (Vardalos) is the biggest concern of her traditional Greek family. Toula knows there is more to life than marrying a Greek man, having Greek babies, and making Greek food, so she enrolls in a college computer course, and improves her appearance. She attracts the attention of a high school teacher, Ian Miller (John Corbett of Sex and the City)--a vegetarian who isn't Greek. Toula tries to keep their relationship a secret, especially from her overprotective father, but her extended family ultimately finds out. When Ian proposes, Toula accepts, and the whole family is thrown into utter chaos. This leads to many hilarious complications and a sweet, touching finale. What makes My Big Fat Greek Wedding so special is that almost anyone can relate to the situations and the characters, which just adds to the film's charm. It is a wonderfully written, beautifully acted, and touchingly real film. Of course all the hype is a bit much and its tremendous success a bit shocking, but I can't say this film doesn't deserve it.

714665,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00006FMUW,Matthew Horner,"[0, 1]","It isn't easy to comment on ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" as a movie without mentioning its boxoffice performance. The independent production cost five million dollars, about ten per cent of the price tag for an average Hollywood studio movie. With a very small promotional budget, it opened on a few screens on April 19, 2002 and should have vanished a couple of months later. Instead, it built and built, taking in nearly a quarter of a billion dollars domestically. The fifth highest grossing movie of 2002, it outdid such high profile titles as ""Signs"", ""Goldmember"", and ""Men in Black II"".This very simple romance is about Toula [Nia Vardalos], an ordinary-looking, second generation Greek woman of thirty who meets and falls in love with Ian [John Corbett], a very tall and very WASP school teacher. This does not sit well with her family, especially her father, who always assumed she'd marry a nice Greek boy. The movie tells the sweet, often hilarious story of how two people from different worlds go from first meeting to the altar.The cast includes some great character actors, including Michael Constantine, Lanie Kazan and Andrea Martin. Ms. Vardalos wrote the witty, semi-autobiographical script.It's hard to pinpoint what made ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" the most successful independent movie ever. It's far from the best movie of 2002; indeed, it's rather slight. One factor may be that it's about unconditional love. From the moment they meet, Toula and Ian are destined to be together. They work through every obstacle without ever resorting to the stupid arguments that abound in most other romantic comedy. They never try to change one another. And they are so filled with the joy and wonder of having found each other, the audience can not help but be filled with joy and wonder, too.",4,Romantic comedy is as sweet and charming as they come,1045353600,"02 16, 2003",2003,1801,"[""n't"", 'easy', 'comment', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'Wedding', 'movie', 'mentioning', 'boxoffice', 'performance', 'independent', 'production', 'cost', 'five', 'million', 'dollars', 'about', 'ten', 'cent', 'price', 'tag', 'average', 'Hollywood', 'studio', 'movie', 'very', 'small', 'promotional', 'budget', 'opened', 'few', 'screens', 'April', '19', '2002', 'should', 'have', 'vanished', 'couple', 'months', 'later', 'Instead', 'built', 'built', 'taking', 'nearly', 'quarter', 'billion', 'dollars', 'domestically', 'fifth', 'highest', 'grossing', 'movie', '2002', 'outdid', 'such', 'high', 'profile', 'titles', 'Signs', 'Goldmember', 'Men', 'Black', 'II', '.This', 'very', 'simple', 'romance', 'Toula', '[', 'Nia', 'Vardalos', ']', 'ordinary-looking', 'second', 'generation', 'Greek', 'woman', 'thirty', 'who', 'love', 'Ian', '[', 'John', 'Corbett', ']', 'very', 'tall', 'very', 'WASP', 'school', 'teacher', 'not', 'sit', 'well', 'family', 'especially', 'father', 'who', 'always', 'assumed', ""'d"", 'marry', 'nice', 'Greek', 'boy', 'movie', 'sweet', 'often', 'hilarious', 'story', 'how', 'two', 'people', 'different', 'worlds', 'go', 'first', 'meeting', 'altar.The', 'cast', 'great', 'character', 'actors', 'including', 'Michael', 'Constantine', 'Lanie', 'Kazan', 'Andrea', 'Martin', 'Ms.', 'Vardalos', 'wrote', 'witty', 'semi-autobiographical', 'script.It', 'hard', 'pinpoint', 'what', 'made', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'Wedding', 'most', 'successful', 'independent', 'movie', 'ever', 'far', 'best', 'movie', '2002', 'indeed', 'rather', 'slight', 'One', 'factor', 'may', 'be', 'unconditional', 'love', 'moment', 'meet', 'Toula', 'Ian', 'are', 'destined', 'be', 'together', 'work', 'obstacle', 'ever', 'resorting', 'stupid', 'arguments', 'abound', 'most', 'other', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'never', 'try', 'change', 'one', 'are', 'so', 'filled', 'joy', 'wonder', 'having', 'found', 'other', 'audience', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'be', 'filled', 'joy', 'wonder', 'too']",N/A

Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[1, 1]","When ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" was released early in 2002, not many people had the opportunity to see it because it was only released in a handful of theaters.  However, word of the film spread quickly and within a short period, the film opened in theaters throughout the world. Consequently, a film that only cost $5 Million to make grossed $359 Million in theaters worldwide. Why?  Because ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" is a very funny, engaging and entertaining film about a woman struggling to find her own identity against the pressure she receives from the members of her very large, extended Greek family.  The woman, Fotoula 'Toula' Portokalos (Nia Vardalos, who also wrote the film), is 30 when the film begins.  She has worked at her father's restaurant, ""Dancing Zorba's"", for many years and has no college education, has low self-esteem and maintains an unattractive appearance.  Her father, Gus Portokalos (Michael Constantine), and her mother, Maria Portokalos (Lainie Kazan), have very traditional values that view a woman's role in life is to get married to a Greek man and have Greek children.While working at the restaurant one day, Toula sees a very handsome man (John Corbett, known for his role in the 1990 TV series ""Northern Exposure"") come into the restaurant with a friend. Toula nervously pours their drinks and takes their food order, but later wants to hide. The experience encourages Toula to make some much-needed changes in her life, including her appearance for which she enlists the aid of her cousin Nikki (Gia Carides).  Wanting more in life than marriage and bearing children, Toula manages to convince her parents to let her take classes at a nearby college.  In addition, her Aunt Voula (Andrea Martin) finds a cunning way to let Toula leave the restaurant to work next door at her travel agency.  While working happily at the travel agency, that same very handsome man walks into the travel agency and introduces himself as Ian Miller (John Corbett).  A romance develops between them, but how will Toula's very traditional family react to Toula dating a man who isn't Greek?Nia Vardalos received many accolades for ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"", including an Oscar nomination for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen.  I hope to see many more wonderful films from her.  Other memorable performances from the very large cast include Christina Eleusiniotis who played Toula at age 6, Marita Zouravlioff who played Toula at age 12, Bess Meisler as Gramdma Yiayia, Louis Mandylor as Nicolas 'Nick' Portokalos, Fiona Reid as Harriet 'Harry' Miller and Bruce Gray as Rodney Miller.Some people may find Nia Vardalos' description of a Greek family to be overly stereotypical, but the purpose of the film was clearly to entertain, not offend.

Nia Vardalos and John Corbett and a host of other fine actors do a great job of telling every bride's story and all of us who've had that big, fat, family made, wedding will certainly connect with it.  This IS a must see movie, but rent it before buying it.  While this is an excellent movie, it's not a story that hasn't been told before or won't be told again.  You may find that having seen it once you don't really need to see it again.

She decides to pretty herself up and then starts to date the man.There is a clash of culture as his family is definately not Greek.  The Greek family is shown to be very large and fun going while the young man's family is very stiff and proper.The highlight of the movie is the constant wanderings of the girl's grandmother and her father's constant insistance that every word in the English language comes from a Greek root.I liked it but I was not overwhelmed by it like some people.

Mazza,"[6, 8]","It's no surprise to me that ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding,"" directed by Joel Zwick, has become one of the biggest, fattest crowd-pleasing movie hits of 2002. This warm-hearted comedy stars Nia Vardalos (who also wrote the script) as Toula, a Greek-American woman who works in the family business. She falls in love with the WASP-y Ian Miller (a very charming John Corbett). Can true love conquer the cultural differences between their two worlds?As someone who comes from a half-Italian, half-Puerto Rican heritage, I can tell you that I could relate to this story 100%. While grounded in the specifics of Greek-American life, the story handles this theme in a way which I believe has universal appeal.Vardalos and Corbett are part of a superb ensemble cast that includes Michael Constantine, Lainie Kazan, and Andrea Martin. These last three in particular do a great job in creating characters that are hilariously outrageous, yet very human and loveable. The humor in the film is an effective blend of silly slapstick, uproarious sight gags, and character-driven humor.""Wedding"" is a film about dealing with a sometimes embarrassing extended family, having pride in your heritage, and reaching across ethnic lines to find romantic love.

My wife loved it and I admit I laughed out loud several times myself. I don't know Nia Vardalos from Adam (or Eve), but I remember John Corbett from his role as Chris on _Northern Exposure_ -- and I've seen Lainie Kazan and Michael Constantine in scores of films over the year. And they were all pretty good. HOWEVER: This thing would have been a lot more believable if they had omitted the computers and Ian's SUV and set it in the mid-1950s instead of the late `90s. I find it *very* difficult to believe there could still be such an insular, inbred, hyper-ethnic extended family existing in urban America today, especially running a couple of successful businesses in a major city. The social equivalent here in south Louisiana would be the old Acadian families with a dozen kids, all of whom speak only Cajun French -- but they're virtually extinct, the subject of reminiscence. Any folks like that these days are *way* down the bayou, not living and working in a big city. Even my son's Vietnamese mother-in-law, who only arrived here to live with her daughter a couple of years, is nothing remotely like the black-clad, hunched mama from Greece.

Ok, so this movie does present a very unique family who is very proud of their culture and it is wildly entertaining.Toula is considered old to not be married.  At 30 she is definitely a spinster in her families eyes.  After all, she was supposed to be married with many kids already.  Because that's what Greeks do according to this movie.  It doesn't help she's a bit frumpy either.  But when she decides to do something different with her life, go to college, and meet a boy who's all wrong for her, it definitely sets off a series of events that her family just isn't quite equipped to handle normally.Characters:Nia Vardalos: Fotoula PortokalosJohn Corbett: Ian MillerLainie Kazan: Maria PortokalosMichael Constantine: Kostas PortokalosAndrea Martin: Aunt VoulaLouis Mandylor: Nick PortokalosGia Carides: Cousin NikkiJoey Fatone: Cousin AngeloVardalos is very charming as Fotoula.  She has that right bit of shyness from being raised with domineering relatives but can still hold her own when she needs to.  She also seems to know what she wants.  And she goes for it.  Even if it did take her awhile to get to that point.  I wasn't quite as fond of Corbett as Ian, her beau.  He was nice enough, but I never really felt we knew that much about him.  Just brief glimpses as his life wasn't near as detailed as Toula's.  My favorite character though was Aunt Voula.  She was a lot of fun and very vibrant.  Martin did a great job in her role and it's hard not to remember her ""vegetarian"" quip.This is a standard ugly girl turns beautiful and meets a guy plot scenario.  It just happens to have a whole lot of Greek thrown into it.  And she really wasn't ugly to begin with, it was more movie theatrics.  I did like how it was a ""forbidden"" love though and what Ian had to go through in order to be with Toula.  And what she had to endure from her family as well.  But the overall sense of the movie was one of fun and closeness and for those who were raised in a family more like Ian's, it sheds light into relationships different than our own (hence wanting to find that good Greek boy now).  I also am weighing the merits of windex as an acne treatment.  So many things to learn from this movie.The music was traditional Greek music too that while not what I'm normally accustomed to, was catchy.  You wanted to get up and dance and shout with them.  And there was plenty of dancing and music.  The filmography was pretty standard.  No special effects, no animation, just regular filmwork following Toula around on her life.  The camera wasn't shaky, so that's all you can really ask for.It's a silly movie and I'm sure there are plenty of flaws.  But I just don't care about them.  I really like it and enjoy pulling out this movie when I need some cheer.Review by M.

714687,AP50P603W4BA7,B00006FMUW,"Ms. H. Sinton ""dragondrums""","[0, 0]","Toula (Nia Vardalos) is a thirty something, single American Greek girl, and, in the eyes of her family, rapidly becoming over the hill. She herself is bored with her monotonous life, with nothing to do other than work as a waitress in her family's restaurant. One day a man walks into her restaurant and Tula's life is about to change forever. The instant attraction she feels seems to somehow give her the push she needs to climb out of her rut, and she promptly enrols on a college course, learns how to use make up and dress well and, best of all, gets a new job in her Aunts travel agency.It is while she is working there that the stranger, Ian, reappears in her life. What follows is a heart-warming tale of two people falling in love whilst trying to overcome their differing ethnic backgrounds. Tula's family are determined she should marry a `nice Greek boy' whilst Ian's, (John Corbett), family are very uptight, middle class and horrified by Tula's outgoing, lively, loud and, above all, large family.The show stealer is Michael Constantine as Mr Portokalos, who believes everyone secretly wants to be Greek and whose favourite occupation is to tell people the origins of words ...of course, in his eyes they all stem from the Greek language, even kimono!

The few negative comments this film has garnered revolve on the ""sterotypical"" portrayal of a greek family.  Actually, the family members here (assumed to be based on Vardolos' own family) are portrayed as rather lovably eccentric and extremely engaging.  Vardalos' real target of malice is the WASP-y family of her fiancee.  They are treated extremely offensively by the writer-actress, and portrayed as wooden, emotionally empty automatons.  Why haven't the critics picked up on that?Even this offensive, toxic racist stereotype of the groom's family might have been more forgivable if there were more laughs, which were few and far between.

Plus, let's throw in the Greek culture to shake things up a bit.  Well, things were certainly shaken up a lot and we appreciate that.  Fotoula ""Toula"" Portokalos, played by Nia Vardalos, becomes the first in her Greek (very Greek) family intending to marry a non-Greek, specifically Ian Miller, played by John Corbett.  Hijinks ensue as her family first does not approve of the relationship, particularly her father, and subsequently try everything in their power to make the wedding go off without a hitch, complete with inviting the entire Portokalos clan, including all 20+ first cousins and beyond, to meet their soon-to-be in-laws.  By the way, is one of the cousins played by a guy from N*SYNC or the Backstreet Boys?  I can't remember which group I'm thinking of.  Anyway, Michael Constantine is easily my favorite in the movie, playing family patriarch Kostas ""Gus"" Portokalos, a man intent on continuing every Greek tradition until the end of time and curing every ailment with Windex.  The family's neighbor, played by Jayne Eastwood, who is only seen ""returning"" the crazy Greek grandmother, is a close second...everyone should use that performance as an example on how to play the straight-man among the craziness and the hilarious.  This is a great comedy about weddings and the insanity surrounding the preparations for these festive events that will appeal to just about any culture...I mean, what culture hasn't experienced this kind of craziness in one way or another?

It seemed to be a pretty obvious story which didn't interest me.Recently I picked it up at the library (for free) and, to my surprise, I found it genuinely heartwarming and entertaining.As others have mentioned, it is sort of a re-hash of Moonstruck, and it isn't as well done.  And yes be prepared for a lot of ethnic stereotypes--the loud Greeks with the garish taste as well as the uptight WASPS. And yes, we know from the opening scene what's going to happen.  I think that the reason the movie overcomes these flaws is the overwhelming love in it.  You can tell that it's a real story and that's what lifts it up from cliche to something genuinely touching.The script is smart and funny.  It moves fast.  And the cast is first rate. To some, the idea that the very homely 30-ish girl in the restaurant would stand a chance with the superbly hunky Ian Miller (played by the irrestable John Corbett) seems impossible.  But the actress is so funny, so real, and so smart, that she really does have enormous appeal.I am always happy to see the wonderful Laine Kazan, who makes every scene a heartwarmer.

714713,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00006FMUW,Reviewer,"[0, 1]","This film is a celebration of life steeped in tradition, family, love and just the joy of living; and it invites you to come in and participate in that celebration, rather than leaving you on the outside looking in, as it were, merely as an observer.  A film that seemingly welcomes and passionately embraces all that is good and worthwhile in the world, ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding,"" directed by Joel Zwick, will make you laugh and make you cry, but most importantly, it will make you ""feel.""  It's one of those rare cinematic experiences that afterwards makes the sky seem bluer, your step a bit lighter and a smile easier to come by; and when a film can do all of that, you know you've come across a bona fide treasure that you're going to hang onto for a long, long time in your memory.Toula Portokalos (Nia Vardalos) is thirty years old, lives with her parents in Chicago and works in the family restaurant, ""Dancing Zorbas.""  Every facet of her life is imbued with all things ""Greek,"" and by proclamation long since issued by her father, Gus (Michael Constantine), Toula is bound by all that is ""holy"" (read:  ""Greek"") to marry a Greek, live a Greek life and bear many Greek children.  For her to even think of doing otherwise would be unfathomable, unthinkable, unimaginable and, well...""UN-Greek.""So it becomes something of a conundrum for Toula when she meets and becomes interested in a man named Ian Miller (John Corbett), a guy who is decidedly NOT Greek in any way, shape or form.  But he asks her out, and one thing leads to another and then another, but before Toula will allow things to get seriously out of hand, meaning ""serious,"" she knows she must run up the flag, take a deep breath and tell her father.  And for Toula, it just may be the hardest thing she's ever had to do in her life.  Ian, meanwhile, is about to experience culture shock, as he is about to be confronted by a family that includes, for example, twenty-seven first cousins, something Ian isn't quite used to; after all, he has ""two"" of his own, and they live in another state.The screenplay was written by star Nia Vardalos, adapted from her own one-woman show, and it fell into capable hands when she turned it over to director Joel Zwick, who picks up the rhythms and the ""sense"" of the story without missing a beat.  Falling into step with his star, Zwick crafts and delivers a film that is totally immersed in the zest and zeal of living.  Under his astute tutelage, the viewer becomes a part of Toula's life, sharing that grand heritage of which Gus is so proud.  He brings the story and the characters to life with detail and nuance, and in such a way that your senses will kick into full throttle.  The images he creates are so vivid, and it's such an engaging presentation, that the vitality he generates is almost tangible, and you can smell the lamb and all of those Greek delicacies cooking in the kitchen.  And Zwick sets it all in motion by establishing a pace that will sweep you along with the story; a carousel ride that will keep you involved and smiling all the way to the end.Nia Vardalos certainly captures the essence of all that is ""Greek"" with her story, and with her affecting performance as Toula.  This is a young woman you get attached to very quickly; there's something of Benny, from ""Circle of Friends"" about her, as well as Muriel, from ""Muriel's Wedding.""  It's a character your heart goes out to immediately, one to whom you wish all good things will come.  There is an introspection to her portrayal that contrasts effectively with her vigorously outgoing environment, and it makes her presence all the more dominating and singular.  And it's actually in the reserve Vardalos exhibits in her character that the viewer finds the way inside to Toula's deepest longings and emotions.  Without question, this is a complex individual, in whom we find not only the strength necessary to maintain autonomy (which she manages to do within the greater structure of her family), but vulnerability born of the respect she demonstrates toward her father, her family and the traditions they so lovingly serve.  It is this very complexity, in fact, that elicits the necessary empathy of the audience, enabling that vital connection between the viewer and Toula.  And Nia Vardalos IS Toula, from the ground up and from the inside out.  Moreover, one would be hard put to discern any distinction whatsoever between the actor and her character, as her performance is entirely natural and genuine.As Toula's mother, Maria, Lainie Kazan is a delight.  The character she creates is totally credible, and she's just a joy to watch.  And the same can be said of Andrea Martin's performance as Aunt Voula.  This is a VERY Greek woman who is boisterous, overtly self-assured, opinionated and dominant; and she will win you over in an instant.  It is Maria and Voula that add some real spice to the film, and when you add in Gia Carides (who plays Nikki) to the mix, you've got a Greek feast fit for the gods.Of all the actors in this wonderful cast, however, the one who absolutely steals ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding,"" is Michael Constantine, who has the role of his career in Gus, and without question, makes the most of it.  From his overabundance of Greek pride to his many and varied personal peccadilloes (like his ever-present bottle of Windex, which he is convinced can cure everything from a minor scrape to the common cold), he simply gives the performance of a lifetime; and if there is any justice in the whole ""Greek"" world, Constantine-- and this film-- will be duly remembered at Oscar time.  It's the magic of the movies.",5,"The Joy of all Things ""Greek!""",1031097600,"09 4, 2002",2002,5631,"['film', 'celebration', 'life', 'steeped', 'tradition', 'family', 'love', 'just', 'joy',

714714,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00006FMUW,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","My Big Fat Greek Wedding (Joel Zwick, 2002)So I finally got around to seeing My Big Fat Greek Wedding. And, as the last American on the planet who hadn't seen it yet, is anyone really going to want to read the hundred seventy-eight-millionth review of this movie? I'll keep it short.Veteran TV director Joel Zwick (whose only other big-screen attempt was the pathetically awful Second Sight in 1989) hits one way, way out of the ballpark here. My Big Fat Greek Wedding is (as the neverending TV ads tell you) the number one romantic comedy of all time, by gross ticket sales. I mean, the thing almost cleared a million in Argentina, of all places. A quarter billion and counting, in America (and that's not including VHS/DVD sales and rentals). And for once, the public seems to have gotten it right... but not that right.Yes, the movie is laugh-out-loud funny. Yes, much of it rings true. But if you've ever seen Second Sight (and I cannot stress how horrifically bad that movie is), you'll see traces of Zwick everywhere. The movie just boils over a few times too often. There are a couple too many obvious panderings to its audience (whose brilliant idea was it to cast Joey Fatone? Please...). While they don't take away form the movie as a whole, given when I saw it, I couldn't help but compare it to Real Women Have Curves, with which it shares the main subtext of the immigrant family fitting into American life. And in every case, the latter film comes out on top. Everywhere Real Women Have Curves is dignified and restrained (please, no girdle jokes from the peanut gallery), My Big Fat Greek Wedding is... well, not. There's too much that says ""we're trying to manipulate you;"" not in the script, but in the direction. And thus it ranks a cut below Real Women Have Curves, but not enough to knock it out of 2002's top ten list. *** 1/2",4,Almost-- but not quite-- as good as Real Women Have Curves.,1048982400,"03 30, 2003",2003,1847,"['Big', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'Wedding', 'Joel', 'Zwick', '2002', 'So', 'finally', 'got', 'seeing', 'My', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'Wedding', 'last', 'American', 'planet', 'who', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'anyone', 'really', 'going', 'want', 'read', 'hundred', 'seventy-eight-millionth', 'review', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'short.Veteran', 'TV', 'director', 'Joel', 'Zwick', 'only', 'other', 'big-screen', 'attempt', 'was', 'pathetically', 'awful', 'Second', 'Sight', '1989', 'one', 'way', 'way', 'ballpark', 'here', 'My', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'Wedding', 'neverending', 'TV', 'ads', 'tell', 'number', 'one', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'time', 'gross', 'ticket', 'sales', 'mean', 'thing', 'almost', 'cleared', 'million', 'Argentina', 'places', 'quarter', 'billion', 'counting', 'America', 'not', 'including', 'VHS/DVD', 'sales', 'rentals', 'once', 'public', 'have', 'gotten', 'right', 'not', 'right.Yes', 'movie', 'laugh-out-loud', 'funny', 'Yes', 'much', 'true', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Second', 'Sight', 'can', 'not', 'stress', 'how', 'horrifically', 'bad', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'see', 'traces', 'Zwick', 'everywhere', 'movie', 'just', 'over', 'few', 'times', 'too', 'often', 'are', 'couple', 'too', 'many', 'obvious', 'panderings', 'audience', 'brilliant', 'idea', 'was', 'cast', 'Joey', 'Fatone', 'Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'form', 'movie', 'whole', 'given', 'when', 'saw', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'compare', 'Real', 'Women', 'Have', 'Curves', 'shares', 'main', 'subtext', 'immigrant', 'family', 'fitting', 'American', 'life', 'case', 'latter', 'film', 'out', 'top', 'Everywhere', 'Real', 'Women', 'Have', 'Curves', 'dignified', 'restrained', 'please', 'girdle', 'jokes', 'peanut', 'gallery', 'My', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'Wedding', 'well', 'not', 'too', 'much', ""'re"", 'trying', 'manipulate', 'not', 'script', 'direction', 'thus', 'cut', 'Real', 'Women', 'Have', 'Curves', 'not', 'enough', 'knock', '2002', 'top', 'ten', 'list', '1/2']",N/A

This is one of three films I saw for the first time without knowing anything about them, the other two being Good Will Hunting and Bend It Like Beckham. Although I consider none a ""great film,"" I thoroughly enjoyed all three but for different reasons I shall briefly discuss.Directed by Joel Zwick and starring Nia Vardalos (also author and screenwriter) as Toula, with Lainie Kazan (her mother Maria) and Michael Constantine (her father Gus) cast in important supporting roles, this film really could have portrayed any large and loving family's ""big fat wedding."" Growing up in a multi-ethnic neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago, I had numerous opportunities to attend weddings and receptions which were strikingly similar to those portrayed in this film but, of course, I had no idea what was happening as members of both families were involved in preparations. Much of this film's great appeal is probably explained by the fact that so many people can identify with the pre-marriage stresses, temper tantrums, threats, tensions, conflicts, alienations, reconciliations, etc. which author Vardalos and director Zwick examine so brilliantly...and so humorously.Toula works in her family's restaurant, Dancing Zorba, and her ""Prince Charming"" proves to be a schoolteacher, Ian Miller (John Corbett). They meet, fall in love, and become engaged. So far, so good. However, the cultural differences between her family and his are significant. Adjustments and accommodations are necessary and often hilarious as the wedding day approaches. The film's ending is not merely happy, it is joyous. Refreshingly is the fact that in this film, there is a total absence of cynicism concerning ethnic differences. They are relevant to the story line and revealed with good humor. Those who enjoy this film are urged to check out Moonstruck (1987) and Return to Me (2000) in which ethnic and cultural values are also celebrated with style, grace, and exuberance.",5,A Big Fat Celebration of Our Shared Humanity,1059955200,"08 4, 2003",2003,2155,"['everybody', 'else', 'appreciate', 'knowing', 'advance', 'film', 'poor', 'can', 'avoid', 'also', 'prefer', 'discover', 'especially', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'rather', 'hear', 'read', 'raves', 'advance', 'one', 'three', 'films', 'saw', 'first', 'time', 'knowing', 'anything', 'other', 'two', 'being', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'Bend', 'Beckham', 'consider', 'none', 'great', 'film', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'three', 'different', 'reasons', 'shall', 'briefly', 'discuss.Directed', 'Joel', 'Zwick', 'starring', 'Nia', 'Vardalos', 'also', 'author', 'screenwriter', 'Toula', 'Lainie', 'Kazan', 'mother', 'Maria', 'Michael', 'Constantine', 'father', 'Gus', 'cast', 'important', 'supporting', 'roles', 'film', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'portrayed', 'large', 'loving', 'family', 'big', 'fat', 'wedding', 'Growing', 'up', 'multi-ethnic', 'neighborhood', 'South', 'Side', 'Chicago', 'had', 'numerous', 'opportunities', 'attend', 'weddings', 'receptions', 'were', 'strikingly', 'similar', 'portrayed', 'film', 'course', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'members', 'families', 'were', 'involved', 'preparations', 'Much', 'film', 'great', 'appeal', 'probably', 'explained', 'fact', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'can', 'identify', 'pre-marriage', 'stresses', 'temper', 'tantrums', 'threats', 'tensions', 'conflicts', 'alienations', 'reconciliations', 'etc', 'author', 'Vardalos', 'director', 'Zwick', 'examine', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'so', 'humorously.Toula', 'works', 'family', 'restaurant', 'Dancing', 'Zorba', 'Prince', 'Charming', 'be', 'schoolteacher', 'Ian', 'Miller', 'John', 'Corbett', 'meet', 'fall', 'love', 'become', 'engaged', 'So', 'far', 'so', 'good', 'However', 'cultural', 'differences', 'family', 'are', 'significant', 'Adjustments', 'accommodations', 'are', 'necessary', 'often', 'hilarious', 'wedding', 'day', 'approaches', 'film', 'ending', 'not', 'merely', 'happy', 'joyous', 'Refreshingly', 'fact', 'film', 'total', 'absence', 'cynicism', 'concerning', 'ethnic', 'differences', 'are', 'relevant', 'story', 'line', 'revealed', 'good', 'humor', 'who', 'enjoy', 'film', 'are', 'urged', 'check', 'out', 'Moonstruck', '1987', 'Return', 'Me', '2000', 'ethnic', 'cultural', 'values', 'are', 'also', 'celebrated', 'style', 'grace', 'exuberance']",N/A

714718,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B00006FMUW,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[2, 3]","""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" is an enjoyable romp about the ethnic eccentricities of a young woman's (Nia Vardelos) family brought to painfully funny light when she marries outside of her Greek community.  It's a thin plot, an excuse to show off its ethnic characters, but it does so hilariously well.  Although there isn't anything about the Portokalos family that we haven't hasn't seen before (the mischievous brothers who pull merciless pranks on their sister's clueless suitors; the compulsion to include three generations of cousins in the immediate family; being devoutly religious; blatant male chauvinism that brands daughters as failures if they aren't mothers by 30, while sons can be bachelors well past that age; that the men cling so tightly to their power, they don't realize how women outmaneauver them with their guile; how women are expected to do only three things - marry Greek men, cook Greek food and bear Greek children), the script has a lot fun playing it to the hilt.  Toula is about 30 and unmarried - not even her family hides how they've given up on her.  Working in her father's caf&eacute;, Toula looks like a premature frump when the story starts (flat hair and glasses that look like they belong on a 9-year old).  Her father is played over the top as a man more Greek than Zeus, Hercules and Zorba rolled up (in a small suburb of tastefully modest houses, the Portokalos home was renovated to suggest the Parthenon, arrayed with columns, statues of the gods and a garage door painted according to the Greek flag; Mr. Portokalos relentlessly challenges others to dream up words that aren't somehow etymologically based on Greek; in case we haven't realized that Papa Portokalos had his roots as a character in some stand-up routine, the script has him toting a bottle of Windex, convinced that it can cure anything from minor burns to psoriasis).  With the help of her mother (Lainie Kazan) and a cooperative aunt (Andrea Martin in another of the flick's over-the-top performances) Toula breaks out of her shell and builds a career for herself.  Remaking herself (her hair and clothes, and swapping her glasses for contacts) Toula falls in love with a teacher (John Corbett from ""Sex and the City"") and manages to sell him and her family on each other.  While suggesting the ethnic clashes, the film remains breathlessly optimistic, and your face will hurt from repeated laughter.  Wise, knowing and fun, the script and the characters are good enough to compensate for its foibles (yes, somebody does utter the line ""it's all Greek to me"", but not until the near end of the flick; though set in and near a Greek caf&eacute; in Chicago, nobody ever says ""chee-boiga, chee-boiga; chip, chip, chip).

It may well be that my daughter brought it over when I last had `The Bug,' hoping to lighten my day by a little innocuous entertainment.It must have worked. This movie is delightfully charming! Nia Vardalos has knocked together a script that is witty and quirky and hilarious, intellectually and culturally satisfying, and just plain fun!Tom Hanks, the executive producer, must have seen something in the possibilities as well, so I stand in good company. We're guys who are both confident enough to enjoy a good `chick flick' when offered the opportunity.The casting is superb! Nia, as a seasoned `Second City' player, more than holds her own with veterans Lainie Kazan, Michael Constantine and Andrea Martin. John Corbett is a delight in his roll as Nia's new and surprisingly non-Greek love interest, Ian.The film is honest and loving and holds to familial relationships as being wonderfully important. The soundtrack includes just enough Greek tunes and motives to color the action without being overpowering or intrusive.I even enjoyed watching it with Greek subtitles, this language being one of which I've had some minimal instruction. My favorite quote, as given by brother Nick (Louis Mandylor) to Toula (Vardalos):[Of course, the Greek won't transfer, which is too bad.]""Don't let your past dictate who you are, but let it be part of who you will become.""

There is little if any character development. The groom's family, for instance: it would have been best if the writer fleshed out these characters a bit more or at least gave them something to say besides ""it's a bundt cake. bundt bundt!""

714723,A1C58YXM2A30CY,B00006FMUW,"Scotman's Film & Book Reviews ""Film & Book Re...","[1, 1]","My Big Fat Greek Wedding was quite the romantic comedy and yet was disappointing in other areas.We have a nerdy, unkempt daughter of a Greek man [Nia Vardalos, who also wrote the screenplay] with a massive personality and belonging to a large Greek family.  She never fit in and rejected what was expected of her (marry Greek, have lots of Greek kids, be a mom) but seemed to blame it all on her family.Her family is quirky to say the least.  They're loud, happy and excitable.  She is so ""not that"" that she is introverted and unhappy most of the time.  She feels trapped and no way out.This part of the story was a bit annoying to me.  I too am Greek and have a large family but we never embraced the traditions of a Greek family as the main character does.  If anything I think I would have enjoyed going to Greek school.Finally she realizes that she can do something about it and goes to college to learn computers (over her father's objections) and gets a job at her aunt's travel agency and makes it work.At the same time she is completely frozen by the entrance of a man in her life.  He's not Greek, her father rejects him, but she falls completely in love and can't help herself.The plot is a bit predictable at this point with the man doing whatever he can to ingratiate himself into her big Greek family.  He on the other hand has a small, quiet family and his parents have a rough time with them - they want a country club wedding, quiet with a few guests - what they get is a big party!Most of the humor comes from the clash of cultures (spitting on someone for good luck --- I have to try that on my family, LOL) and of the woman realizing that she need not be ashamed of her heritage and completely reject it - that she can accept her big Greek family and be independent at the same time.It all works.  Recommended, especially if you have a wild and crazy southern European family.  According to Wiki, this was the highest grossing romantic comedy that never hit big in theaters.Cast!Directed by Joel ZwickProduced by Gary GoetzmanTom HanksRita WilsonWritten by Nia VardalosStarring John CorbettNia VardalosLainie KazanMichael ConstantineIan GomezArielle SugarmanStavroula LogothettisGia CaridesAndrea MartinLouis MandylorJayne EastwoodOther Films with Nia Vardalos:My Life in RuinsI Hate Valentine's Day (Ws)My Big Fat Greek Life - The Entire Series",4,Fun Romantic Comedy - Yasou!,1296086400,"01 27, 2011",2011,2365,"['Big', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'Wedding', 'was', 'quite', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'yet', 'was', 'disappointing', 'other', 'areas.We', 'have', 'nerdy', 'unkempt', 'daughter', 'Greek', 'man', '[', 'Nia', 'Vardalos', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'screenplay', ']', 'massive', 'personality', 'belonging', 'large', 'Greek', 'family', 'never', 'fit', 'rejected', 'what', 'was', 'expected', 'marry', 'Greek', 'have', 'lots', 'Greek', 'kids', 'be', 'mom', 'seemed', 'blame', 'family.Her', 'family', 'quirky', 'say', 'least', ""'re"", 'loud', 'happy', 'excitable', 'so', 'not', 'introverted', 'unhappy', 'most', 'time', 'trapped', 'way', 'part', 'story', 'was', 'bit', 'annoying', 'too', 'am', 'Greek', 'have', 'large', 'family', 'never', 'embraced', 'traditions', 'Greek', 'family', 'main', 'character', 'anything', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'going', 'Greek', 'school.Finally', 'can', 'do', 'something', 'college', 'learn', 'computers', 'father', 'objections', 'job', 'aunt', 'travel', 'agency', 'same', 'time', 'completely', 'frozen', 'entrance', 'man', 'life', 'not', 'Greek', 'father', 'completely', 'love', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'herself.The', 'plot', 'bit', 'predictable', 'point', 'man', 'doing', 'can', 'ingratiate', 'big', 'Greek', 'family', 'other', 'hand', 'small', 'quiet', 'family', 'parents', 'have', 'rough', 'time', 'want', 'country', 'club', 'wedding', 'quiet', 'few', 'guests', 'what', 'get', 'big', 'party', 'Most', 'humor', 'clash', 'cultures', 'spitting', 'someone', 'good', 'luck', 'have', 'try', 'family', 'LOL', 'woman', 'realizing', 'need', 'not', 'be', 'ashamed', 'heritage', 'completely', 'reject', 'can', 'accept', 'big', 'Greek', 'family', 'be', 'independent', 'same', 'time.It', 'works', 'Recommended', 'especially', 'have', 'wild', 'crazy', 'southern', 'European', 'family', 'According', 'Wiki', 'was', 'highest', 'grossing', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'never', 'hit', 'big', 'theaters.Cast', 'Directed', 'Joel', 'ZwickProduced', 'Gary', 'GoetzmanTom', 'HanksRita', 'WilsonWritten', 'Nia', 'VardalosStarring', 'John', 'CorbettNia', 'VardalosLainie', 'KazanMichael', 'ConstantineIan', 'GomezArielle', 'SugarmanStavroula', 'LogothettisGia', 'CaridesAndrea', 'MartinLouis', 'MandylorJayne', 'EastwoodOther', 'Films', 'Nia', 'Vardalos', 'Life', 'RuinsI', 'Hate', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'Ws', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'Life', 'Entire', 'Series']",N/A

A relatively unknown comedienne was discovered by Rita Wilson (actress and wife of Tom Hanks) and her story was put on film - and it starred the unknown comic, not some Hollywood-type, plastic person.  You do not have to be Greek to enjoy this film. The main character (Toula, played by creator/author Nia Vardalos) is growing up as a chubby, hairy, lonely girl in a very Greek, very large home with very eccentric relatives. Her family holds fast to strong family values and unlike all too many families today, they hold strongly to their ethnic traditions.Vardalos tells the story of her life, her loving & nutty family and how she made the decision to change her appearance, education and attitude at age 30 to pursue her dreams. From her father's love of his own Greek heritage to his obsession with the miracle healing powers of Windex, the viewer will quickly fall in love with these quirky characters, warts and all.Despite some deeply held biases, her family is very loving, if not over-protective. When they find out she has been dating a non-Greek man, they go bonkers... but they come around and grow to love their soon-to-be son-in-law.The movie is less about the wedding and more about the family... the positives and negatives of growing up in a big, loud, loving family and how true love conquers all. Best of all, this is based on the true life story of lead actress Nia Vardalos.Her real life husband portrays the friend/colleague of her husband in the film and many of her own relatives made cameos through out.Great acting, great comedic timing and an over-all feel-good film. Family safe? That depends. It is definitely implied that the lead characters have a less than platonic relationship before they are married, but there are no [love] scenes and no nudity in  the film. It's up to the parents to decide what age is appropriate for their kids on this one. A really young child may not appreciate what is going on, but anyone 12 and up should get a kick out of this movie.",5,Big Fat Enjoyment & Laughter,1049846400,"04 9, 2003",2003,2064,"['movie', 'definitely', 'received', 'lot', 'hype', 'good', 'reason', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'comedienne', 'was', 'discovered', 'Rita', 'Wilson', 'actress', 'wife', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'story', 'was', 'put', 'film', 'starred', 'unknown', 'comic', 'not', 'Hollywood-type', 'plastic', 'person', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'be', 'Greek', 'enjoy', 'film', 'main', 'character', 'Toula', 'played', 'creator/author', 'Nia', 'Vardalos', 'growing', 'up', 'chubby', 'hairy', 'lonely', 'girl', 'very', 'Greek', 'very', 'large', 'home', 'very', 'eccentric', 'relatives', 'family', 'fast', 'strong', 'family', 'values', 'too', 'many', 'families', 'today', 'hold', 'strongly', 'ethnic', 'traditions.Vardalos', 'story', 'life', 'loving', 'nutty', 'family', 'how', 'made', 'decision', 'change', 'appearance', 'education', 'attitude', 'age', '30', 'pursue', 'dreams', 'father', 'love', 'own', 'Greek', 'heritage', 'obsession', 'miracle', 'healing', 'powers', 'Windex', 'viewer', 'will', 'quickly', 'fall', 'love', 'quirky', 'characters', 'warts', 'all.Despite', 'deeply', 'held', 'biases', 'family', 'very', 'loving', 'not', 'over-protective', 'When', 'find', 'out', 'been', 'dating', 'non-Greek', 'man', 'go', 'bonkers', 'come', 'around', 'grow', 'love', 'soon-to-be', 'son-in-law.The', 'movie', 'less', 'wedding', 'more', 'family', 'positives', 'negatives', 'growing', 'up', 'big', 'loud', 'loving', 'family', 'how', 'true', 'love', 'conquers', 'Best', 'based', 'true', 'life', 'story', 'lead', 'actress', 'Nia', 'Vardalos.Her', 'real', 'life', 'husband', 'friend/colleague', 'husband', 'film', 'many', 'own', 'relatives', 'made', 'cameos', 'out.Great', 'acting', 'great', 'comedic', 'timing', 'over-all', 'feel-good', 'film', 'Family', 'safe', 'definitely', 'implied', 'lead', 'characters', 'have', 'less', 'platonic', 'relationship', 'are', 'married', 'are', '[', 'love', ']', 'scenes', 'nudity', 'film', 'up', 'parents', 'decide', 'what', 'age', 'appropriate', 'kids', 'one', 'really', 'young', 'child', 'may', 'not', 'appreciate', 'what', 'going', 'anyone', '12', 'up', 'should', 'get', 'kick', 'movie']",N/A

I have friends who are of other ethnic backgrounds who ran into the same problem the Toula did.  Falling in love with someone who is not of their culture, and the differences it can bring.  I really liked the comedic spin of this film.  I thought that Nia Vardalos did an incredible job using humor to show what it means to be a Greek American.Toula is in her 30's, single, and working in the family business.  She is under tremendous pressure to marry and have children by her traditional father.  Toula on the other hand has other plans that her father can't understand.  He cannot understand why she would want to return to school, and he is not into the who modern values thinking like she is.  Her mother wants her daughter to be happy, and understands what Toula wants.  Toula has a crush on Ian Miller(John Corbet of Sex and the City), and when a relationship forms, Toula has to come to terms with their differences, and come to terms with how her family will accept her handsome boyfriend.  When they get engaged, it's funny to watch how the groom's parents are besieged by Toula's large family and their customs.You do not have to be Greek to enjoy this movie.

It could very well be a movie about an Italian, Hungarian, Irish, Polish, Spanish or any other ethnic family.  Toula Portokalos is the quiet responsible daughter working in her father's business (the stereotypical Greek Diner).  Plain, aging (all of 30 years....but ""old""), she embarks upon a journey of metamorphasis, ditching the thick glasses, changing the hair, using a bit of makeup, returning to school, she transforms into a graceful woman, ripe to marry a respectable Greek man and make Greek babies.However, Toula and life have other plans.  She meets the quintessential ""white bread"" American.  Their romance and marriage is a delightful exploration of cultures and family traditions.The movie is extremely well written and acted with an undertone of subtlety which belies its frenetic (yet charmingly accurate) ethnic characterizations.

714739,A2KVUYPLEW4LXT,B00006FMUW,"Strategos ""The Guardian of Time""","[1, 2]","Ultimately, every human being is shaped to a degree by their environment. Most people have strong memories of what it was like to grow up and live a certain place at a certain time, with a certain kind of people. But to what degree does a person's growing environment shape their identity? That may be the ultimate question of the surprise hit movie My Big Fat Greek Wedding.At the film's outset the main character Toula describes what it was like growing up in her Greek family where the whole family gets involved in everything family related (and everyone knows everything about everyone). Unfortunately for her, Toula doesn't seem to really LIKE the way that her cultural heritage affects her life. She didn't like going to Greek School in the summertime as a child and eating food that everyone thought was strange-looking while she went to public school. Given her feelings, it's no surprise she wildly unhappy and dreams of nothing more than getting out of where she is when she finds herself about 30 years old, still living at home, and working in the family restaurant.The truly sad thing about the beginning of this movie is that at the outset, everyone seems to have given up on Toula's having any future life prospects. According to the old-fashioned Greek tradition (she informs us) a Greek woman has only three obligations: to marry a Greek, have lots of Greek children, and cook lots of Greek food. Imagine her family's confusion when Toula starts to have ideas about living her own life and (God forbid) deciding for herself what kind of person she wants to marry.Things really get moving when Toula sees a handsome stranger one day in the restaurant where she works, and then decides to start to make some self changes. She changes her hairstyle and gets contact lenses for eyes (among other things). She takes some college courses (partially thanks to her mother's skillful manipulation of her father) and (again thanks to her mother's people skills) starts working for another relative who runs a travel agency. Here she again meets her handsome stranger, and the two hit it off almost instantly. Naturally doesn't recognize her at first (she has changed her appearance so much), and at first Toula tries to hide her cultural background, ashamed of the truth and fearful of scaring him off.When Toula does tell her new boyfriend about her wild, crazy family, she quickly decides that they are too different and the relationship cannot possibly work out. It's a good thing the guy is open-minded and adaptable. He fails to see how his new-found love could possibly be undone by Toula's family. ""So your parents are weird. Whose parents aren't?"" he asks. But he soon finds out what her parents are like, and then that there is much more to her family than just her parents.The section of the movie that follows is just classic because Toula is trying to hide from her family what she is doing, and when they find out it's like a teenager seeing a boy behind her parents' back (even though Toula is 30!). When her family and friends find out what is really going it results in some of the most hilarious scenes in the movie. Toula's father asks the man why he didn't ask for his permission to see his daughter, and he replies that it seems a little odd because she's middle-aged... Then her father says that a respectful man would ask his permission, and so the he does, only to be told no immediately! Of course no one can get in the way of love between two adults, so despite her family's objections, Toula becomes engaged to the man of her dreams and the real nightmare begins...There's culture shock for the unsuspecting parents of the future husband, juvenile tricks played on him by Toula's brothers (""If you hurt her, I'll kill ya!...Just kidding!""), the baptism of a man nearing middle age, and the shocking revelation to Toula's relatives that he future husband is a vegetarian (""What do you mean he don't eat meat!!!!...Is okay, I make lamb.""). All of this makes for great comedy, as well as a great display of how cultural differences can make something that's innocent and harmless to one culture look terrifying to another.Ultimately though, love (both romantic and familial) triumphs in the end, and Toula comes to the realization her family does indeed make up part of who she is, and is something to be proud of. The real point for me where I saw that things had come full circle was when at the wedding, the father who had once rejected the groom was now welcoming both him and his family as part of his own, and one of the relatives looked on her new in-law and said ""Right now, he LOOKS Greek."" Love and understanding, that's what life is all about. And ultimately, that's what this movie is all about.

""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" has accomplished this wonder with some extras. Audiences receive every comic nuance with gales of laughter and leave the theatre with smiles on their faces. Scriptwriter/Star Nia Vardalos must be a very happy lady these days!Tuola Portokalos is the youngest daughter of a vibrant, extended Greek family.  Not only is there Mom and Dad and bro and sis, there are hordes of aunts and uncles, 27 first cousins, and a live-in Grandma who thinks everyone is a ""bloody Turk.""  Tuola is 30, plain and working as a ""menu presenter"" at the family-owned restaurant, ""Dancing Zorba's.""  She lives at home, rides to work with Dad, and is subsumed by her family.  It is clearly going to take more than contact lenses to make this Plain Jane into a Princess.  Though thoroughly loved, her Papa despairs of her fulfilling her destiny of marrying a Greek boy, having beautiful Greek babies, and cooking for the rest of her life.Michael Constantine is brilliant as Papa Gus.  His performance is much more than just a comic turn.  He is wildly funny, a patriarch, loving father, bewildered husband, hardworking, proud and sometimes poignant.  The eternally lovely Lainie Kazan is the mother we would all stand in line to have. Andrea Martin as chic, voluble Aunt Voula is a first rate scene-stealer.These three are a tough act to follow, and sometimes the less experienced Nia Vardalos and John Corbett as her non-Greek young man, Ian Miller, pale beside them.  Tuola makes a somewhat abrupt transition from wry, intellectual mouse to bedazzled bride-to-be.  John Corbett is almost too agreeable to be true.  Louis Mandylor as brother Nic gives an impressive performance by turns exuberant, tentative, practical joker and sensitive.This is a movie for the entire family.

714742,A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP,B00006FMUW,Takis Tz.,"[4, 7]","Being myself Greek, I obviously saw ""more"" in this film than someone less acquainted with the Greeks. Everything's relative of course, but, this is not the first film of its kind, loads of films have explored the Italo-Americans, Irish-Americans etc, etc..Inevitably, ""My big fat Greek wedding"" is loaded with cliches about Greek Americans mainly, and most of these hide proven truths underneath even if in many instances in the film they're driven way over the top.The Greek-Americans do differ somewhat from native Greeks primarily in the sense that they hold on much more dearly to traditional values and ideals than their compatriots do back in Greece. Most of these values they hold on to become dated and consequently funny in a fast-pacing wildly accelarating world and this is what the film bases its humor on.Was it funny then? Yes, it does have very many funny moments even if it becomes repetitive in the process. But this was in my opinion difficult to avoid. If there's something to laugh about the way expatriated peoples in America behave then it's exactly the fact that their lives do tend to cling onto a cultural routine in their efforts to ""feel closer to home"". The film is very accurate that way, despite the fact that it needs to exaggerate in certain moments in order to reach the viewer.I'd think that this might've been funnier to a Greek or to an Italian even but judging from the reviews here this is not the case as many people seem to have totally loved this film.For me personally, even if I laughed with many of the situations depicted, I also felt it as a painful experience to watch since i know that the truths revealed in the film are in an everyday reality less funny than annoying (and I'm being very, very mild here)..Nia Vardalos has done a very decent job with the script, and I'm saying that knowing very well that it's an extremely difficult job to be accurate in a satire while not bending reality. Try thinking having to do the same about people of your own nationality and you'd see what i mean.I rated this otherwise very good effort with 3 stars only because of an inconsistent story. The way ""Ian"" fell for ""Toula"" was totally not believable. Nor was it any more believable that he succumbed to surreal sacrifices without any resistance or that he never basically objected to anything ever even though he was depicted prior to that as the ""cool independent guy with a drive"".On top of that, the characters had one side of their personalities developed and only, namely the conservative one (for obvious reasons). This mono-dimensionality grew tiring on me towards the end. Perhaps the mistake was the inclusion of  too many characters but i do understand that either you do show a huge greek family (with everything that involves) or you dont.Ian and his family were of course almost forgotten in the plot when it comes to character development, and they were left in the -also- cliche image of the spineless ""foreigners"" that the greek characters in the film fanatically believed anyway in.

Another hard-to-please family member who saw it remarked, ""I haven't laughed this much since 'Some Like It Hot.'""  This movie is about Toula (Nia Vardolos), a completely Americanized girl from a very traditional Greek family, who finally finds the guy of her dreams,  Ian (John Corbett from Sex and The City).  Ian is the only child of  straight-laced country clubby waspy parents (much to the loudly-expressed dismay of Toula's family). Ian and his family are completely unprepared for the large, boisterous and opinionated clan they're about to join through matrimony.  The planning surrounding the wedding is mesmerizing and hilarious as cultures and future in-laws clash.  The fun is always good natured and the laughs are all big.  Another part of the movie's appeal is watching Toula blossom from a plain Jane dutiful daughter (destined, the family assumed, to old maidhood at the ripe old age of 30) into a sparkling woman who knows what she wants. Based on Vardolos' one woman show and produced by Tom Hanks.  Apparently the show struck a special chord with Hanks who experienced something similar when he married Rita Wilson who also hails from a traditional Greek background.

714746,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B00006FMUW,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[2, 2]","""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" holds the record as highest-grossing romantic comedy of all time.  Based on the autobiographical one-woman show written by Nia Vardalos, the film has been released in a tenth anniversary Special Edition.Toula Portokalos (Vardalos) is the plain, 30-year-old single daughter of Greek immigrants who is expected to marry a Greek boy and conform to the traditional wishes of her family.  However, Toula wants more for herself.  She enrolls in a computer course at college and gains the self-confidence to change not only her appearance but her whole attitude.  Her change attracts the attention of handsome Ian Miller (John Corbett), who wins Toula despite her anxieties and her family's shocked opposition.  After all, he's not Greek.  Ian's marriage proposal throws the family into chaos and Toula wonders if she will ever survive the planning of her big day.The movie benefits from an ensemble of great character actors, including Lainie Kazan and Michael Constantine as Toula's parents and Andrea Martin as her colorful aunt.  The script moves briskly and is filled with both visual and verbal gags that land soundly.  Ms. Vardalos does an effective job in her Cinderella-like transformation from dowdy spinster to modern working girl and is adept at portraying Toula as a real character rather than a caricature.  Corbett is pleasant as her suitor.The Combo Pack contains Blu-ray and DVD versions; digital copy; the 30-minute retrospective featurette, ""A Look Back at `My Big Fat Greek Wedding'"" (reuniting Nia Vardalos and John Corbett); deleted scenes; and audio commentary with Vardalos, Corbett, and director Joel Zwick.",5,A Neat Comedy with Oddball Characters,1351987200,"11 4, 2012",2012,1652,"['Big', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'Wedding', 'record', 'highest-grossing', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'time', 'Based', 'autobiographical', 'one-woman', 'show', 'written', 'Nia', 'Vardalos', 'film', 'been', 'released', 'tenth', 'anniversary', 'Special', 'Edition.Toula', 'Portokalos', 'Vardalos', 'plain', '30-year-old', 'single', 'daughter', 'Greek', 'immigrants', 'who', 'expected', 'marry', 'Greek', 'boy', 'conform', 'traditional', 'wishes', 'family', 'However', 'Toula', 'more', 'herself', 'computer', 'course', 'college', 'gains', 'self-confidence', 'change', 'not', 'only', 'appearance', 'whole', 'attitude', 'change', 'attention', 'handsome', 'Ian', 'Miller', 'John', 'Corbett', 'who', 'Toula', 'anxieties', 'family', 'shocked', 'opposition', 'not', 'Greek', 'Ian', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'family', 'chaos', 'Toula', 'wonders', 'will', 'ever', 'survive', 'planning', 'big', 'day.The', 'movie', 'benefits', 'ensemble', 'great', 'character', 'actors', 'including', 'Lainie', 'Kazan', 'Michael', 'Constantine', 'Toula', 'parents', 'Andrea', 'Martin', 'colorful', 'aunt', 'script', 'briskly', 'filled', 'visual', 'verbal', 'gags', 'land', 'soundly', 'Ms.', 'Vardalos', 'effective', 'job', 'Cinderella-like', 'transformation', 'dowdy', 'spinster', 'modern', 'working', 'girl', 'adept', 'portraying', 'Toula', 'real', 'character', 'rather', 'caricature', 'Corbett', 'pleasant', 'suitor.The', 'Combo', 'Pack', 'Blu-ray', 'DVD', 'versions', 'digital', 'copy', '30-minute', 'retrospective', 'featurette', 'Look', 'Back', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'Wedding', 'reuniting', 'Nia', 'Vardalos', 'John', 'Corbett', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Vardalos', 'Corbett', 'director', 'Joel', 'Zwick']",N/A

To paraphrase Bruce Campbell, I think it's all the spores that are effecting the brains of the L.A. sub-culture. So when a wonderful little movie like MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING comes along and ends up breaking all kinds of records and earning tons of money, it really shouldn't be any surprise to anyone. I saw this movie in the theatre three weeks before the video came out and it was the hardest I've laughed in a movie theatre since last fall.Now granted, the plot of the movie is true to formula, perhaps even unoriginal. Also granted that many members of Toula's (Nia Vardalos) family come of as loud and obnoxious and that the film is full of stereotypes. With that all said, the film works exceedingly well and is hilarious to watch.The movie works so well because the characters in the film are so real and believable. Some find this hard to believe because they've really never been a part of a family. However, for anyone who is a part of a family (whether from a large one like Toula; a small one like Ian; or somewhere in the middle) this film is sure to strike a positive cord.MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING is a great comedy because it knows just what type of movie it is and doesn't pretend to be anything else. It's a very real film; one that most people can relate to in some form or fashion. Of course it's formulaic, because that's the way life is--you know the whole circle of life thing.I understand that there are some people who don't like the movie very much. However, I don't understand why there are so many people who have given this film a negative review at Amazon[.com]. Do you people actually do any real living?As a side note, kudos to Tom Hanks and wife Rita Wilson for helping bring this picture to the big screen.

I know that the characters in my big Greek wedding are perhaps an exaggeration of an ethnic segment of the American population, but you can't help but fall in love with them.Mia is incredible and she deserves all of the acclaim that she has recently received.There were so many scenes in this movie that deserve rip-roaring laughter, that I won't even begin to list them all.  However, for me, one of the funniest scenes in the movie was simply every time the camera would pan the neighborhood.  The viewer would see typical suburbia with the nicely groomed (but not overstated) yards and simple brick homes.  As the camera moved down the street, Mia's parents house would come into view and you couldn't help but laugh.

This little gem deserves every kudo it gets, and then some.Refreshingly normal-looking Nia Vardalos basically plays herself in a script she wrote from memories of her own Greek-American upbringing. Maybe that is why the movie comes across as so real and so heartwarming. At any rate, Vardalos plays Toula, a 30-year-old spinster (in her traditional father's eyes) who helps run the family's restaurant, the Dancing Zorba. Hidden behind thick glasses, baggy sweaters and too much hair, Toula is miserable. She loves her family, but she wants to find her own niche in the world--without giving Papa a heart attack.After much high emotion, Toula improves her looks, goes back to school, snags a job in her aunt's travel agency (after all, reasons Papa, it's still family) and meets the man of her dreams (gorgeous John Corbett, ""Aidan"" from ""Sex and the City""). Everything should be happy, no? NO! Ian (the boyfriend) is NOT GREEK, and Papa is beside himself.This movie is simply a delight, from the opening credits to the very end.

U know the plot by now so will spare u that and get to the actors. Michael Constantine (Gus Portokalos) as the dogmatic Greek 'Head' and my ever favorite Lainie Kazan (Maria Portokalos) as ""the neck that turns the (head)"" keep u rolling in the aisle's.Gus Is also the inventer of all the cures in the world,( he goes around with a bottle of windex in his hand and sprys everthing) to cure it.Gus is a firm beliver in family tradition, ie, daughter marries young to a Greek man has babies and raises and cooks and shuts-up, and let's men do their men things. Toula is the daughter and she is 30 and homely and isnt's interested in the greek men that Gus brings around for her.Comes a day when Mr. Right, comes into the restaurant that the Portokalos family own, and Toula works there... she sees Ian Miller(John Corbett) and actually falls apart, very funny scene. She can do nothing but stare, John is amused and leaves with his buddy.Toula decides to make her-self over, change her hair , lipstick, rouge etc.and loose weight and comes out looking quite pretty.Eventually Toula goes to night school to learn travel computers and works for her Aunt. John come in and they finally get together. They date , but the family does not know she is seeing Ian. Gus is dead set against the mixed marriage. But the  old barriers start to break down with the help of the ""Neck"", Maria P. And soon the wedding is being planned.Toula's brother (Nick)  Louis Mandylor-Theodosopulos is always trying to get Ian in trouble by telling him to say things in greek, once at the dinner gathering he told Ian to say something to all the people there, but, Ian was skepticle and asked Nick's cousin if that was what it meant(thank all of you etc) the cousin said yes, and Ian shouted the sentence to the group, only to find out , he said ""I Have three testicles. Dead-silence, then everyone knew what happened and laughed.This was a very enjoyable movie and all the cast and the greek music was great. The family held together even though the non-greek married the daughter. He did become baptised in the Greek Orthodox church. Go see it folks u will laugh all thru it.
