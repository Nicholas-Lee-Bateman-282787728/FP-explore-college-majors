995401,A1DS5AROCQZ4L6,B000FSME38,40yo Average American White Guy,"[10, 10]","If ""Survivor"" seasons were novels, ""Survivor: Palau"" would be considered one of the finest volumes in the series. Why? Amazing, bigger-than-life characters wrapped in a suspenseful storyline that has a satisfying ending!The first half tells the tale of a tribe who, through no obvious fault of their own, are seemingly cursed. All these years later, I still remember Bobby Jon as a heartbreaking tragic character. In mid-story, the heroine slips through the jaws of doom... we cheer! But, will she survive? I think that Stephanie is still, to this day, the most popular woman ever on ""Survivor"".The ""matter of the heart"" as we near the climax is an unexpected twist, but totally works in context. And then, finally, FINALLY... the player who dominates the story wins in the end. Having found myself feeling cheated many times before by juries that could not rise above their own hurts and acknowledge the obvious (Colby in ""Outback"" and Boston Rob in ""AllStars"" come to mind) here credit is given where credit is due. Three cheers!The producers are doing those who haven't seen ""Survivor"" a favor by releasing them in the order that they have: they've skipped over a number of seasons because, quite truthfully, they just aren't very good seasons. ""Survivor: Palau"" totally justifies its release. 4 stars only cuz I haven't seen the DVD release yet. Let's hope the technicals are as good as the superior storyline.",4,Why Palau?

I was completely hooked by season two! (By the way...The description of this season on the product page names Amber Brkich and Jerri Manthey as survivors on this season...that's either Australia or All Stars, not Palau)We enjoyed Survivor Palau overall. It was like watching it for the first time b/c we had very little recollection of this season...we coudln't remember who won in fact. It was a unique season for a lot of reasons. We were able to see how challenges and game play for future seasons was set up in Palau. I never got overly invested in the survivors this season however. Most of them were totally devoid of personality. One tribe in particular seemed like a high school clique filled with mean girls and jock boys who took pleasure in mocking the quiet and shy. There was no open mindedness, no attempt to even get to know each other beyond a surface level. The interpersonal relationships seemed a very small part in this game beyond the inevitable ""cuddling to keep warm"" couples of Barbie and Ken types. The obnoxiousness and flat out meanness of most of the survivors was extremely off putting to me and I had a hard time caring about any of them. (Except for Stephenie and Bobby Jon! Those two were fantastic, full of personality and a lot of fun to watch!) Part of the fun of survivor for me is getting involved with the storyline...Season two Australian Outback and Survivor All stars (Rob and Amber in particular!) were seasons that had a lot more social complexity. For some reason the strategy of riding coattails works well for several survivors in Palau. I'm not overly fond of this strategy and it seemed a popular one on this season.I didn't enjoy this season as much as I have enjoyed others. But it wasn't bad, especially early on. Once the true spunk and personality is gone...I found the rest boring.",3,not a bad season overall...,1238716800,"04 3, 2009",2009,1968,"['husband', 'are', 'Survivor', 'junkies', 'started', 'watching', 'show', 'starting', 'final', 'episode', 'season', 'one', 'caught', 'late', 'was', 'completely', 'hooked', 'season', 'two', 'way', 'description', 'season', 'product', 'page', 'names', 'Amber', 'Brkich', 'Jerri', 'Manthey', 'survivors', 'season', 'Australia', 'All', 'Stars', 'not', 'Palau', 'enjoyed', 'Survivor', 'Palau', 'overall', 'was', 'watching', 'first', 'time', 'b/c', 'had', 'very', 'little', 'recollection', 'season', 'coudl', ""n't"", 'remember', 'who', 'won', 'fact', 'was', 'unique', 'season', 'lot', 'reasons', 'were', 'able', 'see', 'how', 'challenges', 'game', 'play', 'future', 'seasons', 'was', 'set', 'up', 'Palau', 'never', 'got', 'overly', 'invested', 'survivors', 'season', 'however', 'Most', 'were', 'totally', 'devoid', 'personality', 'One', 'tribe', 'particular', 'seemed', 'high', 'school', 'clique', 'filled', 'mean', 'girls', 'jock', 'boys', 'who', 'took', 'pleasure', 'mocking', 'quiet', 'shy', 'was', 'open', 'mindedness', 'attempt', 'even', 'get', 'know', 'other', 'surface', 'level', 'interpersonal', 'relationships', 'seemed', 'very', 'small', 'part', 'game', 'inevitable', 'cuddling', 'keep', 'warm', 'couples', 'Barbie', 'Ken', 'types', 'obnoxiousness', 'flat', 'out', 'meanness', 'most', 'survivors', 'was', 'extremely', 'putting', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'caring', 'Stephenie', 'Bobby', 'Jon', 'two', 'were', 'fantastic', 'full', 'personality', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', 'Part', 'fun', 'survivor', 'getting', 'involved', 'storyline', 'Season', 'two', 'Australian', 'Outback', 'Survivor', 'All', 'stars', 'Rob', 'Amber', 'particular', 'were', 'seasons', 'had', 'lot', 'more', 'social', 'complexity', 'reason', 'strategy', 'riding', 'coattails', 'well', 'several', 'survivors', 'Palau', ""'m"", 'not', 'overly', 'fond', 'strategy', 'seemed', 'popular', 'one', 'season.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'season', 'as', 'much', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'others', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'especially', 'early', 'true', 'spunk', 'personality', 'gone', 'found', 'rest', 'boring']",N/A

Bobby John was my absolute favourite surivor of all time. He wasa never slacking off, he amde friendships, he trusted people, he ahad ethics, he was athletic - if only had had lit that fire and made it to the merge instead of Stephanie, and the final two would have been Ian and Tom --- well, let's jsut say it would have been an A+ al around !Sorry Stephanie fans, but asides from her athletic ability her feeling of entitlemnet was to arrogant and annyoying to watch. I am glad the merged tribe did not fall for her sob story and voted her off fairly quickly. I can't decide if I dislike her for getting rid of JOLANDA and ruining the Tibe's chances of doing well at the very start or the mean spirited immature (and I will add almost 30 yr old) KATIE for making it to the final two !This season has some of the toughest and most exciting challanges I have ever seen on survivor. Even the characters you didn't like much at least made you laugh (AKA James and Karen!)Alot of fun moments, sad ones and twists. Also, guys the scenery is breathtaking.

The winner was a complete BULLY - particularly in the end with the third place finisher. The second place finisher was totally WORTHLESS - more so than any other contestant I've seen. So the vote between the two was a no-brainer. (Maybe that's why people think the winner was so great.) But the real winner should have been the one who finished third. Instead, the third place finisher was relentlessly BROW BEATEN by the others - who should be absolutely ashamed of themselves! There was nothing to apologize for or seek redemption from on the part of the third place finisher!In the end it made for great TV though. The emotion of seeing injustice like that stirs you up.

995411,A2XAGLR8VDOU6T,B000FSME38,"Joshua Spaulding ""Television God""","[11, 17]","Survivor Palau, the tenth season of television's top reality show, featured a number of firsts, a number of records and all in all, a pretty entertaining season of television.Things got dicey right away, when the group of 20 (a first) was cut to 18 via a school-yard pick-em in the first 10 minutes of the season opener. Contestants Wanda and Jonathan never got the chance to put their Survivor game on. They weren't picked and went home first without anyone really getting a chance to know them.What followed was complete and utter dominance by the older, and most will say wiser, Koror Tribe. From the outset, it looked like the younger Ulong tribe would be the stronger group, but Koror used smarts and strong alliance building to dominate the game like nobody had ever done before.Koror won every single immunity challenge and eliminated the entire Ulong Tribe, with the exception of Stephenie LaGrossa, who is quite possibly one of the strongest females to ever play the game of Survivor. This was the first time that one tribe had put together such a streak and for the first time in the 10 seasons, Survivor had a tribe of one when Steph beat Bobby Jon Drinkard in a fire-making challenge to stay in the game as the lone Ulong member. There was no merge either, as Stephenie simply became a member of Koror after one night by herself in the Ulong camp.And while Koror won all the immunity challenges, they also took their fair share of the reward challenges as well. Led by eventual winner Tom Westman, a NYC firefighter, and young Ian Rosenberger, a Penn State graduate and dolphin trainer, Koror was almost unstoppable. Gregg Carey, Katie Gallagher and Jenn Lyon, who ranks as one of the most beautiful women ever to play the game, rounded out the alliance of five that controlled the game in the early going at Koror.The only member of Koror to go home before Stephenie joined the tribe was Willard, who was voted out in a dual tribal council, when Koror and Ulong both went to tribal council on the same night. After Stephenie joined Koror, Coby was voted out and Steph was expected to go next, but Janu, the Vegas showgirl, growing tired of the game, laid down her torch, sparing Steph for another three days. After Steph, Gregg and then Caryn were sent home, leaving the final four of Ian, Tom, Katie and Jenn.After Jenn was eliminated following a tie vote (there were a record number of these as well), Ian found himself in a tough position, caught in his friendship with Tom and Katie and bowed out of the final immunity challenge after almost 12 hours. This challenge was the longest in Survivor history. Tom took Katie to the final tribal council, where she was completely destroyed by her former tribemates and recieved only one vote in the final tally.This season contained some memorable contestants. Tom's thick New York accent made him fun to listen to, and he became the first physically dominant player to ever win the game. Ian showed his true self when he made the decision to bow out to restore his friendships with Tom and Katie. Bobby Jon was quite possibly one of the hardest workers in the history of the game, while Steph, as mentioned, was one of the toughest women to ever play. Both were brought back for another season when the show headed to Guatemala. Though Wanda was only on for a few minutes, her Survivor songs were quite memorable, while the fate of the Ulong Tribe was quite possibly drawn when Jeff, one of the tribe's strongest members, twisted his ankle and asked to be voted out. Two ""romances"" dotted the island shores, as Jeff and Kim got close at Ulong and Gregg and Jenn did the same at Koror.Reality shows on DVD are a tough sell, simply because usually, you know who wins before you watch. What makes these Survivor sets worth buying is the extras and this season has some good features. There are five commentary tracks, with Ian, Tom, Caryn and Steph providing commentary on the season premiere and two-hour finale (though not the reunion portion) and Gregg, Jenn, Katie and Bobby Jon providing commentary on three other episodes.

Ashlee, Kaite, Jeff, James, Jenn, Wanda, Angie, Bobby Jon, Kim, Caryn, Tom, Jolanda, Jonathon, Ibrehem, Willard, Stephnie, Ian, Gregg, Coby, and Janu. It started out as, all of the 20 survivors were on a small boat. Then Jeff Probst came along and told the survivors to swim th shore, the 1st man and woman to cross wins. Stephnie and Jonathon jumped out first, but the other 18 survivors quickly passed them. On the boat, Wanda had all sorts of songs. In an interview she said she had wrote many of them.Ian and Jolanda were 1st to shore and then they claimed their immunity necklaces. The next day the 20 survivors split into 2 tribes, Ulong and Koror. But there were 9 members each, so 2 people would be sent packing. The tribes:Ulong: Ashlee, Jeff, James, Angie, Bobby Jon, Kim, Jolanda, Ibrehem, and Stephnie.Koror: Kaite, Jenn, Caryn, Tom, Willard, Ian, Gregg, Coby, and Janu.Which means Wanda and Jonothon were out. Koror won all of the immunity challenges. But Koror still had to vote out 1 person in a double tribal council: Willard. Until Ulong had 1 member: Stephnie. Stephnie joined the Koror tribe.Koror: Kaite, Jenn, Caryn, Tom, Stephnie, Ian, Gregg, Coby, and Janu.Coby told all of the tribe's secrets to Stephnie, which caused him to be voted out. The next episode, Janu was 1st out of an immunity challange so she had to go to her own island. That tribal council, Janu quit because she wanted Stephnie to stay in the game (so she said). The next episode, Kaite tried to have an all- girl alliance. But Caryn spoiled it and told Tom about it, then Tom eventually told Ian which caused Stephnie to be voted out. Now only 6 remain, Kaite, Jenn, Caryn, Tom, Ian, and Gregg. Gregg won a reward and took Jenn and Kaite. Gregg tried to form an alliace with the 2 girls. Kaite and Jenn decided to stick with the alliance. But, about 1 hour before tribal council Ian pulled Kaite aside and told hre that Tom, Caryn, and himself are voting out Gregg. At tribal council Katie stuck with Tom, Ian, and Caryn to vote Gregg off. The next episode, Caryn was voted out.Final 4: Kaite, Jenn, Tom, and IanThe final 4 had breakfast (real breakfast, not coconut). That night at tribal council, Ian and Jenn double tied. Ian and Jenn fought for survival by fire making skills. Ian won and Jenn was voted out.That night Ian and Tom argued. Then the final immunity challange came. Kaite was 1st out 8 hours later Ian dropped out. They had a tribal council at the challange where Tom voted Ian out.Final 2: Kaite and TomKaite and Tom burned the picnic table. At the final tribal council Katie recived only 1 vote.

I loved Coby, Angie. Bobby Jon was someone to cheer for, and stephanie was an inspiration of never to give up. The winnner for the first time was someone who obviously dominated the game and deserved to be there (however; if the final three did not end the way it did; it would have been a much closer battle, with maybe a different winner. ahh, the shoulda coulda wouldas of Survivor).This is the season where the first Ulonging took place. Ulonging is like Pagonging (affectionaly named after the first tribe in Survivor who got picked off one by one after the merge), but when an entire tribe gets eaten up BEFORE merging. Never before had this happened, and I doubt it will ever happen again. This is the season where for the first time there was no tribes at the beginning of the show.It, like the 9 before it, and the 2 after is a classic season, and needs to be placed on the shelf next to Borneo, the Outback, Pearl Islands and Allstars. It will be enjoyed, and I can't wait for the commentaries and get the insider information.What DOES irk me, is that Palau was only on t.v. 2 years ago. I can remember the drama very clearly, while Africa, Marqueases, Thailand & the Amazon are slowly fading away. At least do what was originally being done, Current-eqsue season (like Palau) with an older season. Rumours have it that Vanuatu is being released for Christmas, and with everyone in love with Cirie from Exile Island it wouldn't surprise me if they release that one next.

995422,AKT8I9H8R37LI,B000FSME38,Sunny Dae,"[2, 4]","Without spoiling, I will go on record as one of a small minority who was completely disgusted by the winner of this season. Up until the last few episodes, I would have admitted the winner was one of the deserving candidates for the title - strong player, dominated in challenges, etc. However, things got ugly towards the end, when the winner realized that the third place runner up was a distinct threat (the number two was a complete non-entity, brought along as a goat. The landslide win would have happened regardless of who sat next to that one). The winner then began a relentless campaign of bullying and brow-beating and playing on Number Three's kind heart and decency, finally ""shaming"" Number Three into handing over the game on a silver platter. One could argue that Number Three was just as much at fault, and should have stood their ground against the vile behavior of the winner. Perhaps so. But I find it much easier to respect poor gameplay that comes of being a good, likable person rather than winning gameplay that comes of being a jerk (and then turning on the schmooze so few people remember the ugly side).That said, I enjoyed the first 5/6ths or so of this season, thus my rating. The first (and only, as far as I remember) instance of one tribe ""conquering"" another, and several strong personalities.
