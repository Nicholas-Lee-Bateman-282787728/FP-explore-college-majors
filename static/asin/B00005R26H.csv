A man named Paul Carter (Stuart Whitman) seems to be responsible. Enter beautiful, zillionaire socialite, Dina Hunter (Barbara Eden). Dina has just returned home after a terrible auto accident. Her husband (Robert Vaughn) is an overly-driven, inattentive jerk. This sends the bored and neglected Dina into the arms of another man. Uh oh! The other man is none other than Paul! She has no idea that he's been following her for months, and insinuating himself into her life! One night, while looking for Paul, Dina stumbles upon his secret recordings and realizes that he's not what he appears to be. This leads to a car chase, and the explosive twist finale! This is Ms. Eden's movie. She is captivatingly gorgeous! She's also a great actress. Her dance scene is a show-stopper! Highly recommended for the Barbara Eden fanatic!...",5,Beauty And The Beast...,1376265600,"08 12, 2013",2013,916,"['WOMAN', 'HUNTER', 'w/', 'murder', 'woman', 'theft', 'diamond', 'jewelry', 'man', 'named', 'Paul', 'Carter', 'Stuart', 'Whitman', 'be', 'responsible', 'Enter', 'beautiful', 'zillionaire', 'socialite', 'Dina', 'Hunter', 'Barbara', 'Eden', 'Dina', 'just', 'returned', 'home', 'terrible', 'auto', 'accident', 'husband', 'Robert', 'Vaughn', 'overly-driven', 'inattentive', 'jerk', 'bored', 'neglected', 'Dina', 'arms', 'man', 'Uh', 'oh', 'other', 'man', 'none', 'other', 'Paul', 'idea', 'been', 'following', 'months', 'insinuating', 'life', 'One', 'night', 'looking', 'Paul', 'Dina', 'secret', 'recordings', 'not', 'what', 'be', 'car', 'chase', 'explosive', 'twist', 'finale', 'Ms.', 'Eden', 'movie', 'captivatingly', 'gorgeous', 'also', 'great', 'actress', 'dance', 'scene', 'show-stopper', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'Barbara', 'Eden', 'fanatic']",The Woman Hunter

I bought it not having ever seen it, because it was cheap and I am interested in the Seventies made-for TV genre and I was pleasantly surprised.  The house featured in the movie has to be one of the coolest locations ever, like something out of an old James Bond movie.  Barbara Eden has some sexy swingin' seventies outfits, Robert Vaughn delivers the goods as usual, and I was surprised to see Whitman still vital and young looking, I thought he was older by the time this was made.  Larry Storch is out of control as a boorish drunk.  Lots of fun.Definitely worth a look if you like Seventies made-for-TV movies, especially if you like Barbara Eden.

Unfortunately, this movie is pretty flat and even the surprises are formulaic.  There is a suspicious though seductive guy watching her during a moment of marriage tension, she is still traumatized from an auto accident, and no one will listen to her fears.  Of course, it isn't what it appears to be, or not completely, etc.  The movie is pleasant enough, but kind of a bore.",3,run of the mill suspense mystery,1196899200,"12 6, 2007",2007,436,"['am', 'fan', 'Barbara', 'Eden', 'who', 'truly', 'natural', 'beauty', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'pretty', 'flat', 'even', 'surprises', 'are', 'formulaic', 'suspicious', 'seductive', 'guy', 'watching', 'moment', 'marriage', 'tension', 'still', 'traumatized', 'auto', 'accident', 'one', 'will', 'listen', 'fears', 'course', ""n't"", 'what', 'be', 'not', 'completely', 'etc', 'movie', 'pleasant', 'enough', 'kind', 'bore']",The Woman Hunter
