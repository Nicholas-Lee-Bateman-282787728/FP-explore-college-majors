They tried to do too many things and some of them superfically and some like the tour of the centuries of documents that have not been viewed it seemed like they spent an inordinate amount of time on.,4,interesting,1380672000,"10 2, 2013",2013,279,"['found', 'parts', 'video', 'very', 'informative', 'tour', 'Scavi', 'tried', 'do', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'superfically', 'tour', 'centuries', 'documents', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'viewed', 'seemed', 'spent', 'inordinate', 'amount', 'time']",Secret Access: The Vatican
1456731,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B005ELVC9I,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[2, 3]","SECRET ACCESS: THE VATICAN (2011, about 105 minutes, for The History Channel, not to be confused with 2013's ""SECRETS OF THE VATICAN"" presented by Frontline in February 2014) is delightful and fascinating viewing for historians and pope-heads alike. Anything that takes us into the Secret Archives to show the rotten-looking shelves and then takes us into the pope's closet--twice the size of my house--well!Everything of interest regarding Vatican City State is on display here and I bemoan the fact that this was not a two-parter at two hours each part. So much is shown that answers the most common questions I have heard about the Vatican, and this documentary even allows us into then-Pope Benedict's private apartments.What is a disgrace is the complete rejection that anything is wrong. The Vatican is perhaps the earth's largest center of corruption and evil. Yet not a word about that--I suppose if they had gone that way they'd have never got in to begin with! But it is a beautiful historical document as far as it goes, and it goes far.Since I suspect the Vatican will implode one day soon, you'd better get this and enjoy the true definition of ""the Magisterium of the Church"".",5,"Secret, heck!
