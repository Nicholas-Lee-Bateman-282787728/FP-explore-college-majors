There seems nothing superfluous about the lives of the people and the country in this film. What I got from the story was lean and meaningful. A spiritual masterpiece in it's visual and emotional impact. All of the characters are real, multidimensional, sympathetic and engaging, busy in the art of living their lives to the very fullest, right down to the bone.I highly recommend this film. My favorite line, that keeps resonating with me the day after viewing (and this may be paraphrased)is, ""All good leaders go the wrong way in the beginning"". It is the spirit of rebellion and passion, mixed with recklessness and ego of youth that is tempered into the wise and trusted servant/leader of the people.

It is a movie, but it pays very close attention to the life of the Dolpo-pa, and as such, it not only presents a story, but captures a &quot;culture in time&quot; that few of us will ever experience.  We may walk through these people's villages, or hire them to carry our gear, but we never can participate in their personal lives.  Eric Valli, whatever his ulterior motives in creating this film (if any), had to have been driven by a love of the people and mountains to put this together.  In an era of globalization and the loss of cultures and languages every year, films of this kind have great anthropological and human geographical value.  It's too bad that more Eric Valli's don't exist to preserve our vanishing human heritage.  When presented as a story, it can reach a much wider audience than a standard documentary;  the story pulls the viewer into the lifestyle.In addition to the movie, I found Debra Kellner's &quot;The Making of Himalaya&quot; to be equally as interesting.  It presents another side of these people as real people interacting with a director and film crew.  There is also an &quot;Electronic Press Kit&quot; which contains interesting footage such as showing cameras strapped on yaks' backs, and the pushing the fiberglass yak down the cliff into the lake.The DVD appears to be a good transfer on my PC and DVD player and has a bonus soundtrack of commentary by Eric Valli and Debra Kellner.Excellent little film.",5,Himalaya - Cinematic documentary,1018224000,"04 8, 2002",2002,1492,"['rented', 'immediately', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'movie', 'very', 'close', 'attention', 'life', 'Dolpo-pa', 'such', 'not', 'only', 'story', 'quot', 'culture', 'time', 'quot', 'few', 'will', 'ever', 'experience', 'may', 'walk', 'people', 'villages', 'hire', 'carry', 'gear', 'never', 'can', 'participate', 'personal', 'lives', 'Eric', 'Valli', 'ulterior', 'motives', 'creating', 'film', 'had', 'have', 'been', 'driven', 'love', 'people', 'mountains', 'put', 'together', 'era', 'globalization', 'loss', 'cultures', 'languages', 'year', 'films', 'kind', 'have', 'great', 'anthropological', 'human', 'geographical', 'value', 'too', 'bad', 'more', 'Eric', 'Valli', 'do', ""n't"", 'exist', 'preserve', 'vanishing', 'human', 'heritage', 'When', 'presented', 'story', 'can', 'reach', 'much', 'wider', 'audience', 'standard', 'documentary', 'story', 'viewer', 'lifestyle.In', 'addition', 'movie', 'found', 'Debra', 'Kellner', 'quot', 'Making', 'Himalaya', 'quot', 'be', 'equally', 'interesting', 'side', 'people', 'real', 'people', 'interacting', 'director', 'film', 'crew', 'also', 'quot', 'Electronic', 'Press', 'Kit', 'quot', 'interesting', 'footage', 'such', 'showing', 'cameras', 'strapped', 'yaks', 'backs', 'pushing', 'fiberglass', 'down', 'cliff', 'lake.The', 'DVD', 'be', 'good', 'transfer', 'PC', 'DVD', 'player', 'bonus', 'soundtrack', 'commentary', 'Eric', 'Valli', 'Debra', 'Kellner.Excellent', 'little', 'film']",N/A

685040,A6K4Q4T3HOGSE,B00005UQ8P,C. casey,"[3, 5]","If you believe film should be an art-form, then you'll love Himalaya. As the director states in the bonus audio track, the production team did not identify and write to a ""target market"" when developing the screenwriting, they did not follow the dreary Hollywood ""recipe"" for filmmaking, and, most importantly, they DID use non-actors to portray almost all the lead and back-up roles. Tinle, the lead character, is a treasure. The first time I viewed the movie, I thought, ""what a wonderful actor."" His timing is exact yet unpredictable, his personality forceful, his face is exquisite, his form unique and authentic. A natural, I thought. Indeed, he plays himself in a quasi-autobiography, and what a wonderful character he is.This is a movie about an ancient civilization we are losing and, sadly, will soon be lost. Really, its a documentary, and, as the director states, it will certainly be used by future historians as a visual artifact of what is soon to become the lost Dolpo civilization of Nepal. The soundtrack conditions you to this heartbreaking reality.The movie is successful on many levels: a mother's lost love (who hasn't seen her adult child since he was eight); a loving grandfather/grandson relationship, which is painfully lost; a wife who loses her husband, and a young boy who loses his father then attempts to make sense out of the loss; a young religious man who chooses the ""difficult"" path over the easy monastic life; a classic confrontation between generations; an old man whose entire life is built on strength, perseverance, and admiration, but then who ultimately must let go of it all to those who are destined to succeed him.I loved this movie. It made me think of my mother, an artist, whom I miss dearly. Himalaya is a work of art.FYI - Eric Valli authored a feature article for National Geographic that details the story of the Dolpo.

685045,A2SRZQU1SZG4RR,B00005UQ8P,"Erika Borsos ""pepper flower""","[3, 3]","It is the outstanding cinematography of the Himalaya Mountains which creates the most profound effect on the viewer ... but equally powerful is the story of how the people in this Dolpo village make a long arduous trek via caravan to trade salt for grain. It is how they sustain their lives in the starkly naked mountain village where they reside. The dangers of this journey are all too real ... yet the people in the village courageously embark on the journey ... knowing the risks and the hardships ... battlng the elements and ultimately facing nature herself, learning to work with her forces to ensure their own survival.The chief elder Tinle learns of the death of his son after the return of a caravan from such a journey ... He becomes despondent and accuses one of the young men of failing to protect his son from death during the journey. Although other men who were there told Tinle that Karma the caravan leader had done all he could to save his son, Lhaka and had even placed himself in danger to bring back his body, Tinle is not convinced. The preparation for another journey begins but Karma and Tinle disagree on the timing of the journey. Karma convinces a group of young men to embark early due to avoid possible snow storms. Based on past experience and the advice he sought from the Buddhist monks, Tinle leaves four days later ...The most emotionally satisfying and beautiful aspects of this story revolve around relationships, one being how Tinle and Karma each grow as human beings when they lead a band of men, women, and children on this arduous but life-sustaining journey through steep mountain trails with deep gorges below them. Another is the fascinating story of why Tinle sent his other son to a monastery to become a Buddhist monk and how their father and son relationship comes full circle. The reason the son chooses to join his father's caravan is heart-warming, despite his not having been prepared for this particular lifestyle. The attraction between Karma and Pema, the widowed wife of Lhaka, is one more ""story within a story"" that is explored. Also moving is how Lhaka's young son helps resolve some issues surrounding power/leadership that is earned ... and power that is given to a person based on birth and status.When the caravans leave the village, the weather is balmy ... the grass is green, they even set-up tents for an overnight rest. Eventually each leader, Karma the younger one, and Tinle, the elder village chief, encounter challenges as they prepare for the coming snow storm which is inevitable. Before the film ends, they each develop a strong bond and respect for the courage displayed by the other ... The ending of this story is very satisfying and emotionally moving. This film has a profound impact on the viewer because it deals with universal human emotions, family relationships, survival of individuals after the losses associated with death and the indomitable human spirit that overcomes adversity - all within a remote, visually stunning and beautiful part of the world.

It was really quite a sight, even though I didn't understand some of what I saw; the movie isn't a documentary after all, so it has no obligation to explain these things for western viewers, and it often doesn't.However, since it's not a documentary about the life of Nepalese people, but a MOVIE, I'm going to review it as such.Where the movie falls short, in my opinion, is NOT in its pace; I never felt that the movie demanded a lot of the viewer, and it should be a relatively easy viewing for anyone (provided that that  anyone doesn't mind subtitles).  Nor is it with the story; it is fairly exciting and features great character development.Rather, I always felt that the director didn't really sympathize with his subject matter. The story is told, but it is always told from a distance; there is never a moment when the camera really zooms in on one of the characters to analyze their personality.  We get to see an exact replica of the traditional Nepalese village, but despite all of the material things of that culture that we see, the movie doesn't really show their day-to-day life, but instead romanticizes everything slightly; looks at all of it like a tourist would.  There is never a sense of real connection there, and I think that this movie could have been much better if the camera didn't always stay at an arm's length away from the characters.If you're willing to forgive that, however, this film will show you more about Nepal than any other film you're likely to watch.  Not psychologically, perhaps (only some of that), but materially at least.

It is reissued theatrically in a limited run in 2001 under the new title, &quot;Himalaya&quot;, an apparent attempt to bring attention to the spectacular Himalayan scenery that abounds in the film. The plot revolves around a seasonal migration by Tibetan trade merchants ( miners ) to harvest salt in The Himalayas. At first, the amateur cast is difficult to bare, over emphasized dialogue, a lot of fake grinning, but as the film progresses the short-ranged realism invoked by these Tibetan actors achieves a documentary-like quality which wouldn't have been reached had the cast been professionally trained.

If they're running for political office, they grovel for votes - then take the final count to court. If they're prizefighters, they bash it out in the ring, with or without biting off ears. In HIMALAYA, each of two contenders races a caravan of yaks over treacherous mountains. Aren't men silly!As the film begins in a remote section of Nepal, the body of village chief Lhapka is brought back to town after he died in a mountain accident. His father and former chief, Tinle (Thilen Lhondup), immediately charges his son's friend Karma (Gurgon Kyap) with being instrumental in the death so that he might assume the chieftanship. Now, it wasn't completely clear to me how the village leader was selected, except that an essential qualification was the ability to guide a yak caravan loaded with salt over the mountains to a market where the mineral is traded for the grain on which the village survives. Otherwise, the chief's position was perhaps hereditary, but confirmed by popular consensus. In any case, the question of who'll lead the next caravan is now at issue. Tinle is thought to be too old, though he vehemently disagrees, and his second son, Norbou (Karma Tensing), is a meek monk who only knows how to paint and pray. Lhapka's son, Tsering (Karma Wangiel), is but a seven year-old boy. Meanwhile, the village seers consult the gods and decree the caravan should leave in 10 days. Karma, somewhat of a hothead, convinces the village's young bucks to follow him with their yaks four days early to avoid the inevitable snow storm. Tinle follows with the old codgers (and their old yaks) on the appointed day. Tinle's group is accompanied by Norbou, Tsering and the latter's mother, Pema (Lhakpa Tsamchoe). Stubborness and macho pride cause Tinle to flog his caravan to a fast pace along a perilous route such that it can catch up with Karma's before both reach a crucial mountain pass.The best thing about HIMALAYA is the scenery, and the bigger the viewing screen the better. With bright eyes flashing out of a dusky face, the next best is the exotic beauty of Pema. Otherwise, I'm not sure why the producers went to the trouble. This isn't so much a bad film as one just too long and unnecessary. No truth about the posturing to achieve dominance is illustrated that can't be observed by any conscious individual on a daily basis in national, office, peer group, or family politics. Perhaps the value of HIMALAYA is that it reduces the stage to one of stark simplicity, and clearly makes the point that the shifting alliances (Pema, Tsering) or wise advice (Norbou) of third parties sometimes renders the contest between adversaries to something no longer worth the effort. On a personal level, I was unsympathetic to the Tinle character whose leadership style seemed centered around shrill, indignant yelling. (No Shackleton or Churchill here.) So, whether it was to be good or bad Karma, I simply didn't care much from early on.Oh, the yaks' shaggy coats were way cool.",3,Mano y mano at high altitude,1037318400,"11 15, 2002",2002,3033,"['So', 'how', 'dominance', 'determined', 'two', 'males', ""'re"", 'running', 'political', 'office', 'grovel', 'votes', 'then', 'take', 'final', 'count', 'court', ""'re"", 'prizefighters', 'bash', 'out', 'ring', 'biting', 'off', 'ears', 'HIMALAYA', 'two', 'contenders', 'caravan', 'yaks', 'treacherous', 'mountains', 'Are', ""n't"", 'men', 'silly', 'film', 'remote', 'section', 'Nepal', 'body', 'village', 'chief', 'Lhapka', 'brought', 'back', 'town', 'died', 'mountain', 'accident', 'father', 'former', 'chief', 'Tinle', 'Thilen', 'Lhondup', 'immediately', 'son', 'friend', 'Karma', 'Gurgon', 'Kyap', 'being', 'instrumental', 'death', 'so', 'might', 'assume', 'chieftanship', 'Now', 'was', ""n't"", 'completely', 'clear', 'how', 'village', 'leader', 'was', 'selected', 'essential', 'qualification', 'was', 'ability', 'guide', 'yak', 'caravan', 'loaded', 'salt', 'mountains', 'market', 'where', 'mineral', 'traded', 'grain', 'village', 'Otherwise', 'chief', 'position', 'was', 'perhaps', 'hereditary', 'confirmed', 'popular', 'consensus', 'case', 'question', 'who', ""'ll"", 'lead', 'next', 'caravan', 'now', 'issue', 'Tinle', 'thought', 'be', 'too', 'old', 'vehemently', 'second', 'son', 'Norbou', 'Karma', 'Tensing', 'meek', 'monk', 'who', 'only', 'how', 'paint', 'pray', 'Lhapka', 'son', 'Tsering', 'Karma', 'Wangiel', 'seven', 'year-old', 'boy', 'Meanwhile', 'village', 'seers', 'consult', 'gods', 'decree', 'caravan', 'should', 'leave', '10', 'days', 'Karma', 'somewhat', 'hothead', 'village', 'young', 'bucks', 'follow', 'yaks', 'four', 'days', 'early', 'avoid', 'inevitable', 'snow', 'storm', 'Tinle', 'old', 'codgers', 'old', 'yaks', 'appointed', 'day', 'Tinle', 'group', 'accompanied', 'Norbou', 'Tsering', 'latter', 'mother', 'Pema', 'Lhakpa', 'Tsamchoe', 'Stubborness', 'macho', 'pride', 'cause', 'Tinle', 'flog', 'caravan', 'fast', 'pace', 'perilous', 'route', 'such', 'can', 'catch', 'up', 'Karma', 'reach', 'crucial', 'mountain', 'pass.The', 'best', 'thing', 'HIMALAYA', 'scenery', 'bigger', 'viewing', 'screen', 'better', 'bright', 'eyes', 'flashing', 'dusky', 'face', 'next', 'best', 'exotic', 'beauty', 'Pema', 'Otherwise', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'producers', 'went', 'trouble', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'bad', 'film', 'one', 'just', 'too', 'long', 'unnecessary', 'truth', 'posturing', 'achieve', 'dominance', 'illustrated', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'observed', 'conscious', 'individual', 'daily', 'basis', 'national', 'office', 'peer', 'group', 'family', 'politics', 'Perhaps', 'value', 'HIMALAYA', 'stage', 'one', 'stark', 'simplicity', 'clearly', 'point', 'shifting', 'alliances', 'Pema', 'Tsering', 'wise', 'advice', 'Norbou', 'third', 'parties', 'sometimes', 'contest', 'adversaries', 'something', 'no', 'longer', 'effort', 'personal', 'level', 'was', 'unsympathetic', 'Tinle', 'character', 'leadership', 'style', 'seemed', 'centered', 'shrill', 'indignant', 'yelling', 'Shackleton', 'Churchill', 'here', 'So', 'was', 'be', 'good', 'bad', 'Karma', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'early', 'on.Oh', 'yaks', 'shaggy', 'coats', 'were', 'way', 'cool']",N/A

685055,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00005UQ8P,Lawyeraau,"[4, 4]","This film has some of most breathtaking scenery ever filmed. Shot high up in a remote area of the Himalayas that has seen very few foreigners, it focuses on the Tibetan people who live in an area of the mountains called Dolpo. These people are referred to as Dolpopas. The love that the director, Eric Valli, has for this region of the world is palpable with the loving care and attention to detail that is lavished on this production. Shot at heights of up to 17,400 feet, this film is a tremendous achievement both cinematically and historically, as it locks in time a little known culture and way of life.The story, which is based upon real life events, details a generational struggle between the young and the old. The storyline is simple. This isolated village is dependent upon trading its salt for grain, so that the village may survive. To do so, a caravan of yaks must make an arduous trek through the Himalayan Mountains to Nepal to effect such a trade. When one such caravan returns to the village, the caravan chief, is dead and his body has been brought back to the village by his best friend, Karma. The dead chief's father and tribal council memeber, Tinle, crazed with grief, suspects Karma of having brought about his son's death in an attempt to take his place as chief of the caravan. His dead son has left behind a beautiful wife, Pema, whom Karma covets, and a young son, whom Tinle wants designated as chief, despite his youth.This sets into play a power struggle between Tinle and Karma, both of whom are headstrong and willful. After the traditional sky burial for the dead caravan chief, this clash of wills results in two separate caravans setting out on the salt trading trek. One is led by Karma who, accompanied by the village youth, defiantly leads his caravan out of the village before the date designated by the village lamas. The other is led by Tinle, who has persuaded his other son, Norbou, a Buddhist monk, to assist him. Accompanied by Norbou the elders of his village, as well as by his dead son's widow and young son, Tinle follows tradition and leaves on the date that the lamas have designated as being most propitious for the difficult journey. The film details each of the respective journeys, as well as the continuing battle of wills between the two leaders. The risks that Tinle takes on the journey in order to to catch up with Karma is captured in all its starkly beautiful, cinematic majesty and will leave viewers sitting on the edge of their seats.Set against a breathtaking backdrop of Himalayan beauty, this is a must see film. The performances by those in lead roles are compelling. Thilen Lhondup, a real life former yak man who had fled Tibet during its invasion by China, is charismatic and powerful as Tinle. Gurgon Kyap imbues the role of the headstrong Karma with a youthful vigor and machismo. Lhakpa Tsamchoe, an exotic beauty who hails from Southern India by way of Tibetan parents, is wonderfully serene in the role of Pema. Karma Wangel is absolutely adorable as Tinle's grandson and will steal the viewers' hearts.Anthropologically rich and visually beautiful, it took the director nine months to film this movie. The daunting logistics, the unpredictable weather, and the use of mostly non actors contributed to this being a time consuming project. In order to maintain as much authenticity as possible, this film was shot entirely on location and the villagers even wore their own clothing in the film. The director's care and effort paid off, however, as this is one of the most stunningly beautiful films ever made. The musical score by Bruno Coulais is haunting, capturing the soaring majesty of the region, as well as some of its mystique. It also offers what I believe to be Tibetan throat singing, a somewhat esoteric form of singing/chanting not often heard in the western world.This film, which was first released under the title ""Caravan"", was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 2000. I believe that it lost to Pedro Almodovar's film, ""About My Mother"", which is also an excellent movie. Having seen both films, however, there is no doubt in my mind that Valli's film should have been the one to walk away with the Academy Award. It is a must have DVD for those who are interested in other cultures, the Himalayas, and, quite simply, a great film.

The story starts like this. A simple story that has been enacted through the ages, in different cultures and written by many storytellers....And there was a child who wanted to be a chief, and his mother who fell in love with her father-in-law's enemy, who wasn't an enemy at all...The story is there, it's a good story, and then there are the mountains, the village, the lake, the yaks, the monastery, the people, the storm, the cold, the customs and the colors, the simply breathtaking beauty of the this world.

I think he is a great artist that can touch hearts all around the planet.This movie is a cultural opening to an ancient civilization but it's also a great fairytale for ourselves and our children.By the way my daughters got up halfway through Kundun but never even breathed during this movie.The faces of the actors are so perfect for their parts that we have to believe that they are real. Actors that are not acting but beeing themselves!One last word on the ultimate meaning of the movie. What it means to be a chief: command on men, but following the will of the gods!

Swinney ""Marc My Words""","[6, 6]","On the surface this might seem like a movie to attract the art house set interested in a foreign location and foreign culture, but it is so much more.  It is a timeless tale capturing timeless issues of the human condition, regardless of cultural boundaries.  It is less about what it means to live in the Dolpo region of Nepal and more about the shift, balance, and tug between generations and the respect for tradition versus the pull of the younger set to move on.The cinematography is exquisite.  The scenery is the stark dry beauty of the Himalayas progressing with the story further and further up into the elevated reaches of snow covered passes.  It is rare to see such beauty captured in other films.  The scenery alone is worth the price of admission.As if the window into the Himalayas wasn't enough, the story line is finely told, finely acted, and finely directed.  There are scores of gems on what leadership is all about, how we sometimes have to bow to higher powers regardless of position, how the generations relate, how we mature, how we accept life and death, and how power shifts.  Besides the depth of the culture-transcending story, we still get a window into the world of what a traders village in the Dolpo region of Nepal may be like.  The oneness of life and the mountains, the salt and grain trade to sustain life, the reliance on the caravan, the system of chiefs, are all a wonderful way to gain a better understanding of another culture from the comfort of you living room.

Judd ""brothersjudddotcom""","[6, 6]","In a magnificent film that manages to combine elements of Shakespeare and a National Geographic special, Eric Valli tells the story of Tinle, the leader of aNepalese village, who upon the death of his son (and presumed successor) engages in a power struggle with Karma, a young rebel against tradition. Karma'sfamily has some sin their past, which I don't think is ever explained, so Tinle is distrustful of him anyway, but this bad blood isonly exacerbated because Karma was on the salt gathering trip where his son died.  Of Tinle's other sons, one is too young, Tsering, and the other is a Buddhistmonk, Norbou, so neither can take over for him.  Instead, Tinle determines to lead the caravan of yaks on the annual salt-trading trek himself, despite hisadvancing years.  Karma, defying the omen-reading of the village's lamas, gathers some of the younger men and leads them and the yaks off with Tinle and amotley party, including both sons, in hot (or bitterly cold) pursuit.Mr. Valli has spent close to two decades photographing in the Dolpo region of Nepal (for National Geographic it is no surprise to learn) andfor this film he used mostly local non-actors.  He's reverent of the culture of the people, appropriately awed by the setting, and, amazinglyenough, manages to convey it all on film.  But don't worry, it's not some social studies project.  When Tinle takes a treacherous shortcut to try and catch upwith Karma it's as exciting as any Hollywood thriller.Though he's a difficult man, almost Lear-like in his determination to dictate events after he passes, we root for Tinle, over the disrespectful Karma.  But whenNorbou offers the lesson of the film--""When two paths open up before you, always choose the hardest one""--we see that the two men, though locked in agenerational clash, are more alike than they or we first realized and that there's an unexpected continuity to the life of the villagers, a circularity entirelyappropriate to their religious beliefs, or vice versa.  The film ends up being as lovely in spiritual terms as it is in physical terms, and that's saying something.GRADE : A",5,Lear into thin air,1026518400,"07 13, 2002",2002,2114,"['magnificent', 'film', 'combine', 'elements', 'Shakespeare', 'National', 'Geographic', 'special', 'Eric', 'Valli', 'story', 'Tinle', 'leader', 'aNepalese', 'village', 'who', 'death', 'son', 'presumed', 'successor', 'power', 'struggle', 'Karma', 'young', 'rebel', 'tradition', ""Karma'sfamily"", 'sin', 'past', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'ever', 'explained', 'Tinle', 'distrustful', 'anyway', 'bad', 'blood', 'isonly', 'exacerbated', 'Karma', 'was', 'salt', 'gathering', 'trip', 'where', 'son', 'died', 'Tinle', 'other', 'sons', 'one', 'too', 'young', 'Tsering', 'other', 'Buddhistmonk', 'Norbou', 'can', 'take', 'over', 'Instead', 'Tinle', 'lead', 'caravan', 'yaks', 'annual', 'salt-trading', 'trek', 'hisadvancing', 'years', 'Karma', 'defying', 'omen-reading', 'village', 'lamas', 'younger', 'men', 'yaks', 'off', 'Tinle', 'amotley', 'party', 'including', 'sons', 'hot', 'bitterly', 'cold', 'pursuit.Mr', 'Valli', 'spent', 'close', 'two', 'decades', 'photographing', 'Dolpo', 'region', 'Nepal', 'National', 'Geographic', 'surprise', 'learn', 'andfor', 'film', 'used', 'mostly', 'local', 'non-actors', 'reverent', 'culture', 'people', 'appropriately', 'awed', 'setting', 'amazinglyenough', 'convey', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'not', 'social', 'studies', 'project', 'When', 'Tinle', 'treacherous', 'shortcut', 'try', 'catch', 'upwith', 'Karma', 'as', 'exciting', 'Hollywood', 'difficult', 'man', 'almost', 'Lear-like', 'determination', 'dictate', 'events', 'root', 'Tinle', 'disrespectful', 'Karma', 'whenNorbou', 'lesson', 'film', 'When', 'two', 'paths', 'open', 'up', 'always', 'choose', 'hardest', 'one', 'see', 'two', 'men', 'locked', 'agenerational', 'clash', 'are', 'more', 'alike', 'first', 'realized', 'unexpected', 'continuity', 'life', 'villagers', 'circularity', 'entirelyappropriate', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'vice', 'versa', 'film', 'up', 'being', 'lovely', 'spiritual', 'terms', 'physical', 'terms', 'saying', 'something.GRADE']",N/A

A major focus of the movie is the trip taken by two groups of Nepalese villagers over the Himalayan mountains to trade their salt for grain to help them survive the winter months.The first group is led by a vigorous young man, Karma, who is a candidate for chieftain of his tribe.  He is opposed by the leader of the second group, Tinle, the current chieftain, who is now old, but still convinced he has the energy to make the difficult trip over the mountain.Tinle consults the gods for guidance and decides to delay the trip for ten days.  Karma convinces half the tribe to follow him and he leaves several days early.  Tinle drives his group hard to finally catch up with Karma on a distant mountain path where the climax of this adventure takes place.At least half of the film shows us Tinle and his group fighting the mountain and the snow to make it over the pass to their destination.  The scenery is truly spectacular and this film is best seen at the movies or on the largest TV screen available.One reason we go to the movies is to take us to far away places that show us people and events completely unlike anything in our experience.

Beautifully filmed--as they were climbing with their yaks, I only wished that I had been there.  The mountains of the Himalaya are a dream for most who hike--a sense of what God must have chosen above all else to be His best.The Himalaya mountain system is the planet's highest and home to all fourteen of the world's highest peaks, including Mount Everest.At times, the Himalaya's grandeur and majesty--and brutality too--reminds one of the Antarctica shown in the ""March of the Penguins,"" which of course has become a classic.  When one hikes, vistas are seen like those in this film, which reinforce the fact that God exists and each of us is blessed.Without giving away too much of the story, at one point the trail falls away and it is literally straight down.  Anyone who has hiked the somewhat-wider trails of the Grand Canyon, for example, knows that feeling well.  An experienced hiking partner of mine got vertigo; and I certainly did not get any closer to the edge than I had to--nor look down in some spots.It is partly a love story, and a story of the generations, and the mountains of which they are a part.  It is small wonder that it was nominated for an Academy Award as ""Best Foreign Film.""The scenery is spectacular--and it rates ""four stars"" for that alone; the acting is terrific, certainly given the fact that most are first-time actors; the photography is excellent, which captures life at the ""top of the world""; portable altitude chambers were used to keep members of the film crew healthy at more than 19,000 feet; and the temperatures were freezing.Yet, it is a beautiful film and a tribute to those who made it; and more importantly, to those who live in the Himalaya full time, about whom their story is told.  Last but not least, there is a fine ""Special Feature"" by Debra Kellner, about how the film was made and the difficulties that were encountered, which ought to make any wannabe filmmaker take heed.",4,"""Himalaya"" is a real treat",1156550400,"08 26, 2006",2006,1997,"['who', 'are', 'hikers', 'Himalaya', 'real', 'treat', 'Beautifully', 'filmed', 'were', 'climbing', 'yaks', 'only', 'wished', 'had', 'been', 'there', 'mountains', 'Himalaya', 'are', 'dream', 'most', 'who', 'hike', 'sense', 'what', 'God', 'must', 'have', 'chosen', 'else', 'be', 'best.The', 'Himalaya', 'mountain', 'system', 'planet', 'highest', 'home', 'fourteen', 'world', 'highest', 'peaks', 'including', 'Mount', 'Everest.At', 'times', 'Himalaya', 'grandeur', 'majesty', 'brutality', 'too', 'one', 'Antarctica', 'shown', 'March', 'Penguins', 'course', 'become', 'classic', 'When', 'one', 'hikes', 'vistas', 'are', 'seen', 'film', 'reinforce', 'fact', 'God', 'giving', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'story', 'one', 'point', 'trail', 'away', 'literally', 'straight', 'down', 'Anyone', 'who', 'hiked', 'somewhat-wider', 'trails', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'example', 'feeling', 'well', 'experienced', 'hiking', 'partner', 'mine', 'got', 'vertigo', 'certainly', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'closer', 'edge', 'had', 'look', 'down', 'spots.It', 'partly', 'love', 'story', 'story', 'generations', 'mountains', 'are', 'part', 'small', 'wonder', 'was', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Film', 'scenery', 'spectacular', 'rates', 'four', 'stars', 'alone', 'acting', 'terrific', 'certainly', 'given', 'fact', 'most', 'are', 'first-time', 'actors', 'photography', 'excellent', 'life', 'top', 'world', 'portable', 'altitude', 'chambers', 'were', 'used', 'keep', 'members', 'film', 'crew', 'healthy', 'more', '19,000', 'feet', 'temperatures', 'were', 'freezing.Yet', 'beautiful', 'film', 'tribute', 'who', 'made', 'more', 'importantly', 'who', 'live', 'Himalaya', 'full', 'time', 'about', 'whom', 'story', 'told', 'Last', 'not', 'least', 'fine', 'Special', 'Feature', 'Debra', 'Kellner', 'how', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'difficulties', 'were', 'encountered', 'ought', 'make', 'wannabe', 'filmmaker', 'take', 'heed']",N/A

It's wonderful to be dropped so completely into another culture by a filmaker that both respects his subject and respects his audience's intelligence. It's not like anything is unclear here or like we need a basis in the culture or religion to understand this, but on the other hand he doesn't try to explain too much either. He just lets the story unfold and brings us along with it.The cinematography was great. The mountains are both things of beauty and spirits and gods and challenges to be reckoned with. In a way this is the story of two stubborn men and the people they effect. As such it's universal, and the message it leaves you with could come from any culture. But it's wonderful that that can be woven in with a trip to a very different, interesting culture. That's what world cinema is about, and this is a fine example.",4,"Beautiful, engaging film, a journey",1123632000,"08 10, 2005",2005,861,"['enjoyed', 'very', 'much', 'wonderful', 'be', 'dropped', 'so', 'completely', 'culture', 'filmaker', 'subject', 'audience', 'intelligence', 'not', 'anything', 'unclear', 'here', 'need', 'basis', 'culture', 'religion', 'understand', 'other', 'hand', ""n't"", 'try', 'explain', 'too', 'much', 'either', 'just', 'story', 'unfold', 'it.The', 'cinematography', 'was', 'great', 'mountains', 'are', 'things', 'beauty', 'spirits', 'gods', 'challenges', 'be', 'reckoned', 'way', 'story', 'two', 'stubborn', 'men', 'people', 'effect', 'such', 'universal', 'message', 'could', 'come', 'culture', 'wonderful', 'can', 'be', 'woven', 'trip', 'very', 'different', 'interesting', 'culture', 'what', 'world', 'cinema', 'fine', 'example']",N/A
