It looks as good as ever, and much more convenient that the disc doesn't need to be turned over to watch the second half.Colin and Jean are the best leads together, dancing in a beautiful duet with one another. These two are experts, and it shows. Colin Dunne projects a passion and refinement in his step dancing that no other male lead has. His speed and timing are perfect, but the main interest is his graceful technique and his musical sense of rhythm so evident in all of his solos. He really shines in his Heartbeat of the World duet with Flamenco dancer Maria Pages, and of course, the ever favorite, Trading Taps with the American tap dancers.Jean Butler, as always, dazzles the audience with her regal beauty and her flowing, graceful soft shoe solos. She has a powerful stage presence and brings out the beauty of Irish dance.The band is excellent. The sets are beautiful, authentic hand painted sets. The company is tight and well-rehearsed. This truly is the best recorded version of the phenomenon Riverdance. The documentaries alone are well worth the purchase of this reissue.",5,The real deal!,1214265600,"06 24, 2008",2008,1164,"[""'m"", 'very', 'happy', 'Riverdance', 'Live', 'Radio', 'City', 'been', 'reissued', 'as', 'good', 'ever', 'much', 'more', 'convenient', 'disc', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'turned', 'watch', 'second', 'half.Colin', 'Jean', 'are', 'best', 'together', 'dancing', 'beautiful', 'duet', 'one', 'two', 'are', 'experts', 'Colin', 'Dunne', 'projects', 'passion', 'refinement', 'step', 'dancing', 'other', 'male', 'lead', 'speed', 'timing', 'are', 'perfect', 'main', 'interest', 'graceful', 'technique', 'musical', 'sense', 'rhythm', 'so', 'evident', 'solos', 'really', 'Heartbeat', 'World', 'duet', 'Flamenco', 'dancer', 'Maria', 'Pages', 'course', 'ever', 'favorite', 'Trading', 'Taps', 'American', 'tap', 'dancers.Jean', 'Butler', 'always', 'audience', 'regal', 'beauty', 'flowing', 'graceful', 'soft', 'shoe', 'solos', 'powerful', 'stage', 'presence', 'out', 'beauty', 'Irish', 'dance.The', 'band', 'excellent', 'sets', 'are', 'beautiful', 'authentic', 'hand', 'painted', 'sets', 'company', 'tight', 'well-rehearsed', 'truly', 'best', 'recorded', 'version', 'phenomenon', 'Riverdance', 'documentaries', 'alone', 'are', 'well', 'purchase', 'reissue']",Riverdance: Live from Radio City Music Hall

I had heard about the amazing performances given around the globe by this dance company, but this DVD was my first real exposure.  I have to say I saw totally blown away by the skill, visual and total sensual experience of this DVD.  The dancers and musicians were awesome.This DVD was almost like two performances in one.  You had the dance and you had the music.  The orchestra performed a couple of songs that can standalone in my book as some of the best music -- sort of new age in nature.  In fact it reminded me a bit of Yanni or John Tesh at times.  But it would harken back to the Irish tones and bring you back home to its roots.The dancers and singers were just wonderful.  The solo artists had the most crisp and clear voices I've heard in quite some time.  The principal dancers for the company clearly enjoyed their art -- dancing quite challenging pieces with smiles on their faces and a love of dance written all over them.  One can only imagine the amount of time it has taken to perfect this dance -- totally in step with each other and in harmony with the music.  The segment that mixed a bit of street dance with the traditional Riverdance format was lively and demonstrated the universal nature of dance to culture.I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who loves music and dance.  You don't have to be Irish to appreciate the craftsmanship that has gone into making this DVD and the Riverdance company.  It is just amazing.",5,"Wonder, Amazement - Dance",1203292800,"02 18, 2008",2008,1514,"['had', 'not', 'been', 'exposed', 'phenomenon', 'Riverdance', 'had', 'heard', 'amazing', 'performances', 'given', 'globe', 'dance', 'company', 'DVD', 'was', 'first', 'real', 'exposure', 'have', 'say', 'saw', 'totally', 'blown', 'away', 'skill', 'visual', 'total', 'sensual', 'experience', 'DVD', 'dancers', 'musicians', 'were', 'awesome.This', 'DVD', 'was', 'almost', 'two', 'performances', 'one', 'had', 'dance', 'had', 'music', 'orchestra', 'performed', 'couple', 'songs', 'can', 'standalone', 'book', 'best', 'music', 'sort', 'new', 'age', 'nature', 'fact', 'reminded', 'bit', 'Yanni', 'John', 'Tesh', 'times', 'would', 'harken', 'back', 'Irish', 'tones', 'bring', 'back', 'home', 'roots.The', 'dancers', 'singers', 'were', 'just', 'wonderful', 'solo', 'artists', 'had', 'most', 'crisp', 'clear', 'voices', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'quite', 'time', 'principal', 'dancers', 'company', 'clearly', 'enjoyed', 'art', 'dancing', 'quite', 'challenging', 'pieces', 'smiles', 'love', 'dance', 'written', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'amount', 'time', 'taken', 'perfect', 'dance', 'totally', 'step', 'other', 'harmony', 'music', 'segment', 'mixed', 'bit', 'street', 'dance', 'traditional', 'Riverdance', 'format', 'was', 'lively', 'demonstrated', 'universal', 'nature', 'dance', 'culture.I', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'anyone', 'who', 'music', 'dance', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'Irish', 'appreciate', 'craftsmanship', 'gone', 'making', 'DVD', 'Riverdance', 'company', 'just', 'amazing']",Riverdance: Live from Radio City Music Hall
