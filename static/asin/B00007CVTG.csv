726824,AGEIT17HENDIS,B00007CVTG,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","Reader of this space will, probably, already be familiar with the name of Willie Dixon if one is the slightest bit familiar with Chicago blues, Chess Records, Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf or even The Rolling Stones' cover of his ""Little Red Rooster"". In this one hour presentation you get a very quick overview of his major songs, his take on the ups and downs of the blues as a genre and his performance of a number of his classics written while at Chess and at other venues. Outstanding is his classic ""I've Got The Blues"" and the song that Koko Taylor and Howlin' Wolf made famous, ""Wang Dang Doodle"". This is a serious piece of blues, especially Chicago blues, history by a man at, or near, the center of it in its hey day as he nears the end of his own career (1984).",4,"I Am The Blues, Indeed",1242086400,"05 12, 2009",2009,770,"['Reader', 'space', 'will', 'probably', 'already', 'be', 'familiar', 'name', 'Willie', 'Dixon', 'one', 'slightest', 'bit', 'familiar', 'Chicago', 'blues', 'Chess', 'Records', 'Muddy', 'Waters', 'Howlin', 'Wolf', 'even', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'cover', 'Little', 'Red', 'Rooster', 'one', 'hour', 'presentation', 'get', 'very', 'quick', 'overview', 'major', 'songs', 'take', 'ups', 'downs', 'blues', 'genre', 'performance', 'number', 'classics', 'written', 'Chess', 'other', 'venues', 'Outstanding', 'classic', ""'ve"", 'Got', 'Blues', 'song', 'Koko', 'Taylor', 'Howlin', 'Wolf', 'made', 'famous', 'Wang', 'Dang', 'Doodle', 'serious', 'piece', 'blues', 'especially', 'Chicago', 'blues', 'history', 'man', 'center', 'hey', 'day', 'end', 'own', 'career', '1984']",N/A

If you buy this one then you'll have all of what's on Wang Dang Doodle and vice versa so this one show is all there is (as of 2013) of video featuring Willie Dixon as the leader of a blues band.Performance videos were different before the DVD era. I admit to be spoiled by recent technology. I am not referring to sound and vision but overall creation of these types of concert videos. Nowadays, you'd expect to get a complete live performance unedited with interviews with the musicians included as a bonus track or at least isolated between tracks.You don't get a video edited to conform to modern technology. You do get a video which is very much a product of its time. Time constrants (DVD runs 60 minutes) must've caused the director to chop some of these songs up (and in one instance they completely edit out a Carey Bell harp solo) so they can fit in some of the Willie Dixon interview they made for the release. The end result is more of a story about the man and his music than a complete concert and an interview to fill out the release.I find it hard to pan this release because of these issues because they are what they are (product of the pre DVD age) and I wonder if there is any at all surviving footage that may lead to a complete performance DVD.  My hope is that this release sells well enough for the manufacturer to make a fuller version of this and other Blues DVDs if that's even possible.This is a straight DVD transfer of a previous released VHS. My brand new copy of this was a DVDR so be warned. We are in low budget territory. The sound and vision quality is good in a VHS sense.4 STARS BECAUSE THE MUSIC IS A TREAT TO HEAR AND THAT'S WHAT MATTERS THE MOST.",4,"EXACT SAME DVD AS DIXON ""WANG DANG DOODLE""",1362700800,"03 8, 2013",2013,1789,"['WARNING', 'are', 'two', 'DVDs', 'Willie', 'Dixon', 'available', 'feature', 'same', 'show', 'same', 'content', 'buy', 'one', 'then', ""'ll"", 'have', 'what', 'Wang', 'Dang', 'Doodle', 'vice', 'versa', 'so', 'one', 'show', '2013', 'video', 'featuring', 'Willie', 'Dixon', 'leader', 'blues', 'band.Performance', 'videos', 'were', 'different', 'DVD', 'era', 'admit', 'be', 'spoiled', 'recent', 'technology', 'am', 'not', 'referring', 'sound', 'vision', 'overall', 'creation', 'types', 'concert', 'videos', ""'d"", 'expect', 'get', 'complete', 'live', 'performance', 'unedited', 'interviews', 'musicians', 'included', 'bonus', 'track', 'least', 'isolated', 'tracks.You', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'video', 'edited', 'conform', 'modern', 'technology', 'do', 'get', 'video', 'very', 'much', 'product', 'time', 'Time', 'constrants', 'DVD', '60', 'minutes', 'must', ""'ve"", 'caused', 'director', 'chop', 'songs', 'up', 'one', 'instance', 'completely', 'edit', 'out', 'Carey', 'Bell', 'harp', 'solo', 'can', 'fit', 'Willie', 'Dixon', 'interview', 'made', 'release', 'end', 'result', 'more', 'story', 'man', 'music', 'complete', 'concert', 'interview', 'fill', 'out', 'release.I', 'find', 'hard', 'pan', 'release', 'issues', 'are', 'what', 'are', 'product', 'pre', 'DVD', 'age', 'wonder', 'surviving', 'footage', 'may', 'lead', 'complete', 'performance', 'DVD', 'hope', 'release', 'well', 'enough', 'manufacturer', 'make', 'fuller', 'version', 'other', 'Blues', 'DVDs', 'even', 'possible.This', 'straight', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'previous', 'released', 'VHS', 'My', 'brand', 'new', 'copy', 'was', 'DVDR', 'so', 'be', 'warned', 'are', 'low', 'budget', 'territory', 'sound', 'vision', 'quality', 'good', 'VHS', 'sense.4', 'STARS', 'THE', 'MUSIC', 'TREAT', 'TO', 'HEAR', 'AND', 'THAT', 'WHAT', 'MOST']",N/A

Willie's life was remarkable, but his insights into other artists is invaluable.  This isn't just a book about one legendary bluesman, it is a history of the blues, itself.

The overall sound is fantastic, and great interviews with Willie and crew. The picture quality is also great, a must have for any Willie Dixon or Carey Bell fan. The only bad thing, like most blues DVD'S TO SHORT! less than one hour. After looking at the other reviews, I thought I would edit mine, the fact that we have footage at all of Willie is great. So what if he is old, (what a petty complaint) still it's a great show.

726828,A157T7L0BY7WFZ,B00007CVTG,"TXdust ""Gabe""","[0, 0]","Blues has a deep influence on Rock and Roll.  And if you walk through the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and look at the biggest artist through its history there is a pattern.  Many of those bands given rock god status have covered and hit big with a Willie Dixon song.  As a blues man who wanted people to hear the blues he says he welcomed groups like Led Zeppelin and artists like Eric Clapton to use his music to reach audiences he believed were out of his reach.  This man gave so much to music without asking for anything in return.  I'm guessing you know who Willie Dixon because your debating purchasing this video, but incase you don't know he is one of the fathers of what rock and roll has become.  While the world was going crazy for the Rolling Stones, he was who The Stone were crazy about.  Who Led Zepplin played while relaxing in the studio, and how many other bands found their sound.  As a fan I enjoyed this more than even I thought possible.  The production value wasn't the best, but I believe considering the date between taping and release its not worse than it could be.  Things are sometimes cut short which tells me that part of the performance didn't make it through the destruction of time.  Like the painting of George Washington in the White House is torn on the bottom, the missing parts of the show doesn't damage the over all performance.  As is, this is a great DVD to watch, such a strong outpour of talent from a performer on the eve of his career.  A must for any fan, young or old. Many singers of all type loss their presence on stage.  Usually time is the worst enemy of a singer, but not for a blues man, because a blues man strength comes from the blues, and yet a blues man can never conquer the blues, he understand it a little more each day.",4,Facing the last stage exit,1349654400,"10 8, 2012",2012,1783,"['Blues', 'deep', 'influence', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'walk', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'look', 'biggest', 'artist', 'history', 'pattern', 'Many', 'bands', 'given', 'rock', 'god', 'status', 'have', 'covered', 'hit', 'big', 'Willie', 'Dixon', 'song', 'blues', 'man', 'who', 'wanted', 'people', 'hear', 'blues', 'welcomed', 'groups', 'Led', 'Zeppelin', 'artists', 'Eric', 'Clapton', 'use', 'music', 'reach', 'audiences', 'believed', 'were', 'reach', 'man', 'gave', 'so', 'much', 'music', 'asking', 'anything', 'return', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'know', 'who', 'Willie', 'Dixon', 'debating', 'purchasing', 'video', 'incase', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'one', 'fathers', 'what', 'rock', 'roll', 'become', 'world', 'was', 'going', 'crazy', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'was', 'who', 'Stone', 'were', 'crazy', 'Who', 'Led', 'Zepplin', 'played', 'relaxing', 'studio', 'how', 'many', 'other', 'bands', 'found', 'sound', 'fan', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'even', 'thought', 'possible', 'production', 'value', 'was', ""n't"", 'best', 'believe', 'considering', 'date', 'taping', 'release', 'not', 'worse', 'could', 'be', 'Things', 'are', 'sometimes', 'cut', 'short', 'part', 'performance', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'destruction', 'time', 'painting', 'George', 'Washington', 'White', 'House', 'torn', 'bottom', 'missing', 'parts', 'show', ""n't"", 'damage', 'performance', 'great', 'DVD', 'watch', 'strong', 'outpour', 'talent', 'performer', 'eve', 'career', 'must', 'fan', 'young', 'old', 'Many', 'singers', 'type', 'loss', 'presence', 'stage', 'Usually', 'time', 'worst', 'enemy', 'singer', 'not', 'blues', 'man', 'blues', 'man', 'strength', 'blues', 'yet', 'blues', 'man', 'can', 'never', 'conquer', 'blues', 'little', 'more', 'day']",N/A
