Just got it last Friday and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I felt there were some geniune scares and to use a comparison, I watched both it and APOLLO 18 and enjoyed this one much more.  But I nearly fainted when I saw it now sells for nearly $1000.  It had better have more going for it (such as all four Beatles appearing on the soundtrack or Russell Crowe and Meryl Streep in the lead roles) before I would pay that!  But is it worth $10, $20? Yeah. it's an old school type horror film (reminds me of something from the 1980's, say) and has a simple premise.  The use of the F word is tiresome but as I said before the scares are genuine.  Is it like PARANORMAL ACTIVITY?  A little.  It's basically a haunted house movie.  What can I say without telling the story?  I enjoyed it.  No gore, no nudity that I noticed but the female lead wears really low cut blouses that would please young men (tho she is no Scarlett J).  The man wears no such revealing clothes but then again we are not talking Ryan Goslng here so that is no loss.  I just believe in equal opporunity ogling for we womenfolk.  Anyway, it's a nice way to waste 90 minutes or so.

1513694,A2W36OONSDMA03,B0068TRUIM,M. Randall,"[1, 3]","UPDATED REVIEW:Please don't be fooled by the several positive reviews on this page. Everybody praising this movie is either one of the Roccos in disguise or a friend/family member put up to it. It should be fairly obvious when pretty much every positive reviewer says something along the lines of ""Can't wait for more"", ""Great soundtrack"", ""I think this movie is real"", and ""better then Paranormal Activity"". Yeah right. You guys must be dreaming. The most comical fake review is the one that says ""Excellent dialog"". The dialog is easily the weakest part of this film. Nothing but UMs, UHs, and F Bombs throughout the entire flick. Half of these people have done reviews on several other Rocco products, coincidently always giving them 5/5 stars and saying its a ""must-have"". The other half of them have no other reviews, which should be an indication that the account was created for the sole purpose of creating a fake review. So yeah, they are obviously fake reviews and it is puzzling that Amazon hasn't caught on to this yet. Anyways, long story short, all the people arguing with the negative reviewers in the comment section for this movie are people associated with the film in one way or another, so don't be phased by it. They all threaten to report you if you talk ill of this horrid movie, but hey, the truth hurts. Amazon review pages are meant for truth, not lies. And I'm sure potential buyers would appreciate honest reviews over fake ones.And with that being said, now on to my review.CONTAINS SPOILERSThe acting was terrible. The characters were unlikable. The story was unbelievable. One ghost was a overweight man in a rubber mask, who simply walked around. Scary. Another ghost was what looked like a gothic woman standing in a bush in broad daylight. Frightening. The music was not needed, and when present, sucked. This is indeed a found footage movie, but easily one of the worst I've seen. The product is produced on a DVD-R and wouldn't even play on my XBOX 360. I returned it and got a replacement sent and the 2nd disc wouldn't play on the XBOX either. I ended up watching this movie on my computer's DVD-Rom because it was so cheaply produced. To be fair, this may however be Amazon's fault though, and shouldn't be considered part of actual movie review. Then Again, I've ordered tons of DVD-R on demand movies from this site before and they've all worked perfectly on any device so I wouldn't be shocked if it was the source file; the cruddy movie. So overall, a bad experience at every turn. I Don't advise watching this movie. Heck, it took me a week to watch the whole thing because I couldn't stomach more then 10-20 minutes per day. I have no personal vendetta against the people who made this film, but I do feel that the truth should be told and honest reviews should surface. Because honestly, all the fake reviews are quite sickening. To wrap up this review, the ending is a blooper reel. Really? It makes you wonder how all these reviewers could possibly think the film was real footage when it ends with outtakes... Did you guys even watch the movie or did the Roccos just tell you what to type? Pretty sad. AVOID this movie at all costs & please beware of future fake reviews from these people.EDIT:Since I wrote this, a couple of reviews have either been deleted or edited so that my claims will not seem valid. At this time I am not 100% sure if the users purposely deleted their reviews to spite me, or if Amazon finally caught on to their little charade and cleaned house a little. Either way, good riddance to them and now the overall star rating for this movie is finally beginning to show some truth of what people really think of it. This will be my last form of interaction with this awful movie or any of the people involved with it.

1513697,A1M0YAZ6JV488Z,B0068TRUIM,"Tom's Reviews ""Tom Hunter""","[0, 1]","I am a fairly critical reviewer of horror, primarily because today it is so inexpensive (both in time and money) for most anyone to create a movie and upload it to Amazon and elsewhere, that there is a glut of absolutely terrible ""films"" on the market today (and I think that now that genie is out of the bottle, so this is the new reality of the horror movie genre). Anyway, suffice to say that I have spent a lot of my meager disposable income on streaming movies here on Amazon and on Netflix, with very few real creepy and spooky moments to show for it - especially with regard to ""lost footage"" films which are the most conducive to those no/low budget movies I mentioned. So it was with no small amount of surprise when I found myself genuinely creeped out by The Bake Street Hauntings. I won't give any spoilers here, and while this movie is not perfect, it makes up for its shortcomings (one big one being wayyy too many F-bombs - OH and the chemistry between the ""husband"" and ""wife"" is non-existent in those roles - they are more like a brother and sister who haven't seen each other in awhile and are throw together and commence to the old nagging sibiling back-and-forth - you won;t buy them as a couple, trust me) with a few - correction, more than a few - moments that brought me back to the same chills I got from Blair Witch, Session 9, and others. Part of it has to do with the dialog, which never seems scripted (pardon the pun) and actually seemed pretty genuine. I am guessing the director encouraged a lot of ad libbing, which works perfectly in Bake Street. Good camera work, which also, again, made this feel much more believable than 90% of its kind in the low budget lost footage genre (esp with the lack of nightvision, which works extremely well here, and is fairly unique in this day and age when every horror movie has the cast using a nightvision-equipped home camera). I definitely recommend this one - and I recommend watching it in the dark, preferably alone, for maximum spooky factor (and yes I suppose most horror works well in that setting, but it works especially well here). I have recommended this one to my friends and the response has been overwhelmingly positive.",2,Definitely a diamond in the rough for a two star movie,1352332800,"11 8, 2012",2012,2206,"['am', 'fairly', 'critical', 'reviewer', 'horror', 'primarily', 'today', 'so', 'inexpensive', 'time', 'money', 'most', 'anyone', 'create', 'movie', 'upload', 'Amazon', 'elsewhere', 'glut', 'absolutely', 'terrible', 'films', 'market', 'today', 'think', 'now', 'genie', 'bottle', 'new', 'reality', 'horror', 'movie', 'genre', 'Anyway', 'suffice', 'say', 'have', 'spent', 'lot', 'meager', 'disposable', 'income', 'streaming', 'movies', 'here', 'Amazon', 'Netflix', 'very', 'few', 'real', 'creepy', 'spooky', 'moments', 'show', 'especially', 'regard', 'lost', 'footage', 'films', 'are', 'most', 'conducive', 'no/low', 'budget', 'movies', 'mentioned', 'was', 'small', 'amount', 'surprise', 'when', 'found', 'genuinely', 'creeped', 'out', 'Bake', 'Street', 'Hauntings', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'spoilers', 'here', 'movie', 'not', 'perfect', 'up', 'shortcomings', 'one', 'big', 'one', 'being', 'wayyy', 'too', 'many', 'F-bombs', 'OH', 'chemistry', 'husband', 'wife', 'non-existent', 'roles', 'are', 'more', 'brother', 'sister', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'other', 'awhile', 'are', 'throw', 'together', 'commence', 'old', 'nagging', 'sibiling', 'back-and-forth', 'won', 't', 'buy', 'couple', 'trust', 'few', 'correction', 'more', 'few', 'moments', 'brought', 'back', 'same', 'chills', 'got', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Session', '9', 'others', 'Part', 'do', 'dialog', 'never', 'scripted', 'pardon', 'pun', 'actually', 'seemed', 'pretty', 'genuine', 'am', 'guessing', 'director', 'encouraged', 'lot', 'ad', 'libbing', 'perfectly', 'Bake', 'Street', 'Good', 'camera', 'work', 'also', 'again', 'made', 'feel', 'much', 'more', 'believable', '90', '%', 'kind', 'low', 'budget', 'lost', 'footage', 'genre', 'esp', 'lack', 'nightvision', 'extremely', 'well', 'here', 'fairly', 'unique', 'day', 'age', 'when', 'horror', 'movie', 'cast', 'using', 'nightvision-equipped', 'home', 'camera', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'one', 'recommend', 'watching', 'dark', 'preferably', 'alone', 'maximum', 'spooky', 'factor', 'yes', 'suppose', 'most', 'horror', 'well', 'setting', 'especially', 'well', 'here', 'have', 'recommended', 'one', 'friends', 'response', 'been', 'overwhelmingly', 'positive']",The Bake Street Hauntings

This one isn't any worse than several other lame attempts to cash in on the success ofParanormal Activity(I thought thatParanormal Entitywas actually rather good).  This movie actually has a few genuine chills.  There's also a couple of really cheesy and eye-rolling, ""you gotta be kidding me"" moments.  With only two main characters (unless you count the ghosts) I felt the movie worked on a more intimate level.  The characters struck me as fairly realistic, alternating between fear and nervous laughter.  Personally, in all of these movies, I have always wondered why people who suspect something paranormal is going on insist on going to bed with all the lights off.  This movie takes care of that by shutting off the power!  Unless you've been in a blackout, you don't really understand how dark ""no light"" really is.  In parts of the movie the audio is so bad, that you can't hear whatever noise is so scary; in other parts, the lighting is so dark that you have no way of knowing just what the heck is going on.
