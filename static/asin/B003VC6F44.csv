He just could not control his appetites.  Manzarek likes to think of the Doors as a group about acid, weed and fun.  However, Morrison, in the end, was much about whiskey, coke and heroin.  He was a stone cold alcoholic and coupled with Pam &#34;Cinnamon Girl&#34; Courson he did not have much of a chance.  She was a junkie.  All of us Doors' fans hated the way it ended for Morrison but it was inevitable.  Some intelligent rockers, like Neil Young, got thru the 60s and 70s, it was not to be for James Douglas Morrison.  I think he could have been a decent poet.  Well, if he had to go, then why not in a mystery.  We're still talking about him and their are plenty of Morrison fans, old and new.

And co9mmentary with people who had NOTHING to do with those times - and only have their Options to offer.Of course no one can truly act like Morrison.,4,Pretty Good - for a low-budget documentary.,1387670400,"12 22, 2013",2013,487,"['really', 'blips', 'interviews', 'comments', 'people', 'connected', 'doors.I', 'think', 'documentary', 'Mostly', 'got', 'right', ""'Final"", '24', 'years', 'leading', 'up', 'Morrison', 'death.What', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'images', '1980', '90', 'jeep', 'upside-down', 'talk', 'accident', 'late', '1940', 'co9mmentary', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'NOTHING', 'do', 'times', 'only', 'have', 'Options', 'offer.Of', 'course', 'one', 'can', 'truly', 'act', 'Morrison']",N/A
1366989,A19YOYY7FLQMA6,B003VC6F44,"Tante Maren ""Maren""","[93, 99]","I have been a Doors and Jim Morrison fan since buying their first great album, The Doors in 1967. I own all their records, cd's, dvd's, posters and dozens of Doors and Jim Morrison books, so I do know all the stories about Jim Morrison's death. I will always remember July 3, 1971, because my mother broke the news of Jim Morrison's death to me, by saying, ""That guy you have all over your closet door is dead."" I was actually shocked, as anyone who followed the Doors, knew that Jim Morrison's drug of choice was alcohol. Unfortunately for Jim, his girlfriend Pamela Courson's drug of choice was heroin. Whether Jim Morrison accidentally snorted heroin thinking it was cocaine, or just snorted it to get high with Pam, as the film depicts,  makes no difference, as Jim was quite ill long before this final heroin death.I thought this short 48 minute film would be re-enactments by unknown actors of Jim's last hours and wouldn't offer anything interesting or new, as I have read everything about Jim's death, but I was pleasantly surprised! The 48 minutes is well spent with great photos, great film clips, accurate re-enactments and great commentaries and stories from a few key people that knew Jim Morrison. Some of the great people who tell the story of Jim Morrison's last hours are: JAMES RIORDAN-author of Break On Through; VINCE TREANOR-The Doors Road Manager; PAMELA DES BARRES-Former Rock Groupie; BEN FONG-TORRES-Former Editor of The Rolling Stone; STEVE HARRIS-Former Vice President of Elektra Records; TANDY MARTIN-Jim's School Friend; TONY FUCHES-Jim's Bodyguard and drinking buddy; ALAIN RAISSON-First Firefighter on the death scene before the French medics arrived, and others. These people tell absolutely great stories of Jim's life back then, which help put together the end of his life in Paris. I especially enjoyed listening to the great drinking stories from Jim's bodyguard, Tony Fuches, who called Jim-Jimbo.The film clips are really great, as they show an array of Doors footage, some of which I have never seen before and even Jim's last apartment in Paris- #17 Rue Beautreillis, where he and Pam lived on the third floor. There are photos I have never seen as well- it was really enjoyable seeing a little boy Jim with blonde hair!I had read the more recent stories of Jim's death told by Jim's UCLA friend Alain Ronay, who spent the last days with Jim in Paris, and this film does stick to the stories Alain told. I found this film to be basically true based on all the books I've read, with one exception- Pamela Courson. The film makes Pamela look quite innocent in her not calling a doctor for Jim, at Jim's insistence that she not call one, when he vomits 3 buckets of blood. Pamela was a full blown heroin addict, and if there's one thing I know from growing up in the sixties, is that if a house is on fire and the resident is a heroin addicted mother with 5 children, that mother will let all those children burn to save her dope first.I see Pamela Courson in a much different light than the film maker puts her in. Jim Morrison was extremely ill long before he died, and when a person doesn't know how to save themselves, having a partner who will let you die to save her dope is a sad way to go. The film also never mentions that Pamela bought the absolute cheapest coffin for Jim, that was such a cheap flimsy wood box, that they had to put dry ice in the box to keep Jim more insulated until his burial. I'm certain that Pamela's choice of buying the cheapest coffin in Paris for Jim was due to the fact that she needed all of Jim's cash for her next heroin fix. With the exception of making Pamela Courson look like a loving caring girlfriend, instead of the addict that she was, who loved heroin over Jim, this film was basically right on the truth about Jim's last days and death. The commentaries and stories were excellent and interesting, the few clips and photos that I have never seen before were really great to see, the last hours of Jim's life were very well put together, and overall a very worthwhile buy for a Jim Morrison or Doors fan!",4,48 Fascinating Minutes Of Jim Morrison's Final Hours,1287705600,"10 22, 2010",2010,4091,"['have', 'been', 'Doors', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'fan', 'buying', 'first', 'great', 'album', 'Doors', '1967', 'own', 'records', 'cd', 'dvd', 'posters', 'dozens', 'Doors', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'books', 'do', 'know', 'stories', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'death', 'will', 'always', 'remember', 'July', '3', '1971', 'mother', 'broke', 'news', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'death', 'saying', 'guy', 'have', 'closet', 'door', 'dead', 'was', 'actually', 'shocked', 'anyone', 'who', 'followed', 'Doors', 'knew', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'drug', 'choice', 'was', 'alcohol', 'Unfortunately', 'Jim', 'girlfriend', 'Pamela', 'Courson', 'drug', 'choice', 'was', 'heroin', 'Whether', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'accidentally', 'snorted', 'heroin', 'thinking', 'was', 'cocaine', 'just', 'snorted', 'get', 'high', 'Pam', 'film', 'depicts', 'difference', 'Jim', 'was', 'quite', 'ill', 'long', 'final', 'heroin', 'death.I', 'thought', 'short', '48', 'minute', 'film', 'would', 'be', 're-enactments', 'unknown', 'actors', 'Jim', 'last', 'hours', 'would', ""n't"", 'offer', 'anything', 'interesting', 'new', 'have', 'read', 'everything', 'Jim', 'death', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', '48', 'minutes', 'well', 'spent', 'great', 'photos', 'great', 'film', 'clips', 'accurate', 're-enactments', 'great', 'commentaries', 'stories', 'few', 'key', 'people', 'knew', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'great', 'people', 'who', 'tell', 'story', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'last', 'hours', 'are', 'JAMES', 'RIORDAN-author', 'Break', 'Through', 'VINCE', 'TREANOR-The', 'Doors', 'Road', 'Manager', 'PAMELA', 'DES', 'BARRES-Former', 'Rock', 'Groupie', 'BEN', 'FONG-TORRES-Former', 'Editor', 'Rolling', 'Stone', 'STEVE', 'HARRIS-Former', 'Vice', 'President', 'Elektra', 'Records', 'TANDY', 'MARTIN-Jim', 'School', 'Friend', 'TONY', 'FUCHES-Jim', 'Bodyguard', 'drinking', 'buddy', 'ALAIN', 'RAISSON-First', 'Firefighter', 'death', 'scene', 'French', 'medics', 'arrived', 'others', 'people', 'tell', 'absolutely', 'great', 'stories', 'Jim', 'life', 'back', 'then', 'help', 'put', 'together', 'end', 'life', 'Paris', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'listening', 'great', 'drinking', 'stories', 'Jim', 'bodyguard', 'Tony', 'Fuches', 'who', 'called', 'Jim-Jimbo.The', 'film', 'clips', 'are', 'really', 'great', 'show', 'array', 'Doors', 'footage', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'even', 'Jim', 'last', 'apartment', 'Paris-', '17', 'Rue', 'Beautreillis', 'where', 'Pam', 'lived', 'third', 'floor', 'are', 'photos', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'well-', 'was', 'really', 'enjoyable', 'seeing', 'little', 'boy', 'Jim', 'blonde', 'hair', 'had', 'read', 'more', 'recent', 'stories', 'Jim', 'death', 'told', 'Jim', 'UCLA', 'friend', 'Alain', 'Ronay', 'who', 'spent', 'last', 'days', 'Jim', 'Paris', 'film', 'stick', 'stories', 'Alain', 'told', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'basically', 'true', 'based', 'books', ""'ve"", 'read', 'one', 'exception-', 'Pamela', 'Courson', 'film', 'Pamela', 'look', 'quite', 'innocent', 'not', 'calling', 'doctor', 'Jim', 'Jim', 'insistence', 'not', 'call', 'one', 'when', '3', 'buckets', 'blood', 'Pamela', 'was', 'full', 'blown', 'heroin', 'addict', 'one', 'thing', 'know', 'growing', 'up', 'sixties', 'house', 'fire', 'resident', 'heroin', 'addicted', 'mother', '5', 'children', 'mother', 'will', 'let', 'children', 'burn', 'save', 'dope', 'first.I', 'see', 'Pamela', 'Courson', 'much', 'different', 'light', 'film', 'maker', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'was', 'extremely', 'ill', 'long', 'died', 'when', 'person', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'save', 'having', 'partner', 'who', 'will', 'let', 'die', 'save', 'dope', 'sad', 'way', 'go', 'film', 'also', 'never', 'mentions', 'Pamela', 'bought', 'absolute', 'cheapest', 'coffin', 'Jim', 'was', 'cheap', 'flimsy', 'wood', 'box', 'had', 'put', 'dry', 'ice', 'box', 'keep', 'Jim', 'more', 'insulated', 'burial', ""'m"", 'certain', 'Pamela', 'choice', 'buying', 'cheapest', 'coffin', 'Paris', 'Jim', 'was', 'due', 'fact', 'needed', 'Jim', 'cash', 'next', 'heroin', 'fix', 'exception', 'making', 'Pamela', 'Courson', 'look', 'loving', 'caring', 'girlfriend', 'instead', 'addict', 'was', 'who', 'loved', 'heroin', 'Jim', 'film', 'was', 'basically', 'right', 'truth', 'Jim', 'last', 'days', 'death', 'commentaries', 'stories', 'were', 'excellent', 'interesting', 'few', 'clips', 'photos', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'were', 'really', 'great', 'see', 'last', 'hours', 'Jim', 'life', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'overall', 'very', 'worthwhile', 'buy', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'Doors', 'fan']",N/A
