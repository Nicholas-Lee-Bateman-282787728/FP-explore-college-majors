This show tells a great accounting of the Holy Wars that were so long ago.  It has great info and in depth coverage on what happened between these two great leaders in a time of death and chaos.  If you are a fan of the Holy Wars or just ancient civilizations and battles this is a must buy for you.,4,Very well done,1128816000,"10 9, 2005",2005,364,"['always', 'loved', 'PBS', 'Empire', 'series', 'was', 'exception', 'show', 'great', 'accounting', 'Holy', 'Wars', 'were', 'so', 'long', 'ago', 'great', 'info', 'depth', 'coverage', 'what', 'happened', 'two', 'great', 'leaders', 'time', 'death', 'chaos', 'are', 'fan', 'Holy', 'Wars', 'just', 'ancient', 'civilizations', 'battles', 'must', 'buy']",Empires - Holy Warriors: Richard the Lionheart & Saladin

If anyone is expecting to get a comprehensive treatment of the Third Crusade, look elsewhere.  One is gets as accurate a treatment of history as in ""Kingdom of Heaven,"" which played fast & loose with historical accuracy.One would get the impression that Richard I was the prime force behind the Crusade, depsite the fact that Barbarossa & the Germans left for the Holy Land a full two years earlier.  The program would have you believe that after Barbarossa's death, the German armies simply melted away --- I believe the narrator actually said that most of the Germans ""went home.""  If he meant that ""home"" was Antioch, then I suppose that is an accurate statement.  It was the remnants of the German army (largely decimated by plague) that successfully defended Tyre (left almost unmentioned in this program) against Saladin's forces.  Also barely mentioned is Phillip II of France, who played a key role in the political events that unfolded in the Holy Land.The producers at least mentioned Richard's execution of the 3000 prisoners (following the siege of Acre), but left unmentioned is Richard's complicity in the assasination of Conrad of Montferrat, recently crowned King of Jerusalem, in 1192.  The program would prefer to paint Richard as a noble warrior, rather than a political strategist of the first order.  The political in-fighting between the Germans, French & English (not to mentioned the already entrenched Crusader States) is a not insignificant part of the story of the Third Crusade, but it goes entirely unmentioned here.In fact, this program skims the topwaters to such a degree that only a historical neophyte could find much value in it.

I really can't tell you how historically accurate this presentation is. I can tell you that there are some points I know that are presented as fact, that truly are fact. The rest of the video seems to be centered on the two personalities and the drama involved. It makes me wonder how many wars are fought over the wills of two individuals. I feel that both sides of the issue were fairly represented. The Holy land is equally important to Muslims as well as Christians. Yes, i know, Christians were there before the Muslims, but the Jewish people were there before either Muslim or Christian. Maybe someone needs to ask them how they see the issue. I cannot automatically assume as a Christian that the Muslims are wrong and that the Crusades were always justified. The history of the Catholic church and Christianity in general is full of bloodshed much like the Old Testament itself. I am sure those of the Islamic faith feel the same way about their own faith.

I have not been disappointed, until now.This is such a romanticised account of Richard the Lionheart. The writers were at great pains to paint a picture of a noble and selfless Richard. Filled with so much laughable spin, it excuses him of his cowardice (e.g. his retreat from attacking Jerusalem not once but twice) and his excesses (e.g. the slaughter of the 3000 arab prisioners).Saladin was painted as a ruthless man who did everything to obtain and retain power. The compassion he showed towards the Christian civillians after capturing Jerusalem was viewed with skepticism and negative spin.When an organisation like PBS start producing such an unbashedly bias and jaundiced documentary, it only shows the effect 9/11 has had on society.

There is no difference. Popular history today is written by retold by the victors. In the case of the Crusades in this trashy work, you get to see/hear only the dominant Muslim perspective of things.This is a highly biased work against King Richard.This work praises Saladin and extols him as generous, prayerful, virtuous, etc.To hear all the biases and hatred of King Richard coming out from the mouths of stupid white men and women of today is astounding! Evil Islam has indeed won, not only then but now. The Europe of today has abandoned traditional Christianity for atheist secularism, to its own detriment, can't tell good from bad, right and wrong, anymore.For every brief scene of King Richard praying, you see at least 3x or more of Saladin riding high as victor on his horse, praying or screaming allah here, allah there, and praying in scenes that are lenthened to heighten the effect that Saladin is ""more holy"" than Richard.When Richard goes to rescue his fellow Christians, he is condemned.When Saladin condemns his own Muslims at Acre, Saladin is praised for being tough and Richard condemned for being merciless.When Saladin steals the true cross and refuses to trade it in exchange for the lives of his fellow Muslims, nothing is said about him. Instead, Richard is blamed for all the ills.When Saladin resorts to poison and starvation to murder scores of Christians, he doesn't take the blame, but instead blames Christians for coming to settle in the Holy Land!etc.What a skewered sense of justice Muslims and this work have.Note that the Muslim commentators in this DVD swell with tears in their eyes as they talk of bloody Saladin! They revere only blood, war, genocide, murder and all things evil. What has changed in Islam today? Nothing. They're a religion of war.When Christians rise to defend Christians, Christians are condemned?What irony.Who stole the lands from Jews and Christians after the birth of Islam?Somehow, it still eludes Muslims of today why the Crusades were even called for. For Muslims, they think that the whole world evolves around them.It is not enough that they're colonial and expanisionist in nature, but they never see it that way, instead, they always blame everything on the West.Enough said for now.
