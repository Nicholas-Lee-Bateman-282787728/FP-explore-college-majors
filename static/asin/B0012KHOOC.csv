I thought to myself: pick this movie up and watch a bunch of comedians from his circle. Unfortunately this movie was made in such a way to even make Vince Vaughn boring.Part of the problem is that the movie was not marketed like a documentary. The box and the title both make it seem like a show full of comedy sketches. Perhaps if I started watching with the understanding that this was a behind-the-scenes look at a 30-day tour with a group of comics I would have approached the movie with a better mindset. Instead I watched the movie -- at first waiting for it to begin even after it had begun -- for about 10 minutes.Horrible editing kills this movie. Just as something MIGHT become interesting, the shot jumps somewhere else. Just as I'm starting to think THIS scene might go somewhere, we've moved again. Halfway through I looked at my friends and asked, ""Do you think none of this is real? That it is a joke that this is a movie and that we are trying to watch it?"" I debated whether to listen to the commentary but that seemed reduntant because the whole movie feels like one long commentary; and in this case a boring one.We finally realized we were funnier ourselves and that if a camera was set up in my living room and recorded whatever we did it would have made a more entertaining movie.",1,Disappointed in comedy tour documentary,1214006400,"06 21, 2008",2008,1425,"['had', 'high', 'hopes', 'movie', 'watching', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'high-speed', 'monologues', 'keep', 'surprised', 'toes', 'thought', 'myself', 'pick', 'movie', 'up', 'watch', 'bunch', 'comedians', 'circle', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'such', 'way', 'even', 'make', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'boring.Part', 'problem', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'marketed', 'documentary', 'box', 'title', 'make', 'show', 'full', 'comedy', 'sketches', 'Perhaps', 'started', 'watching', 'understanding', 'was', 'behind-the-scenes', 'look', '30-day', 'tour', 'group', 'comics', 'would', 'have', 'approached', 'movie', 'better', 'mindset', 'Instead', 'watched', 'movie', 'first', 'waiting', 'begin', 'even', 'had', 'begun', '10', 'minutes.Horrible', 'editing', 'kills', 'movie', 'Just', 'something', 'MIGHT', 'become', 'interesting', 'shot', 'jumps', 'somewhere', 'else', 'Just', ""'m"", 'starting', 'think', 'THIS', 'scene', 'might', 'go', 'somewhere', ""'ve"", 'moved', 'again', 'Halfway', 'looked', 'friends', 'asked', 'Do', 'think', 'none', 'real', 'joke', 'movie', 'are', 'trying', 'watch', 'debated', 'listen', 'commentary', 'seemed', 'reduntant', 'whole', 'movie', 'feels', 'one', 'long', 'commentary', 'case', 'boring', 'one.We', 'finally', 'realized', 'were', 'funnier', 'ourselves', 'camera', 'was', 'set', 'up', 'living', 'room', 'recorded', 'whatever', 'did', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'entertaining', 'movie']",Vince Vaughn's Wild West Comedy Show: 30 Days & 30 Nights - Hollywood to the Heartland

1137597,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0012KHOOC,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 1]","In 2005, actor Vince Vaughn gathered together a handful of comedians from The Comedy Store in Hollywood - Ahmed Ahmed, John Caparulo, Bret Ernst and Sebastian Maniscalco - built an extended stand-up show around their acts, then took it on the road for a 30-city-in-30-day whirlwind tour across the United States, starting in Los Angeles and ending in Chicago, with 28 stops in between.  Vaughn also brought a few documentary filmmakers along for the ride, the result being ""Vince Vaughn's Wild West Comedy Show,"" an at best fair-to-middling account of that event.Some of the backstage stuff is of moderate interest - particularly the comics offering a free show to some Hurricane Katrina refugees and Ernst's touching reflections on his older brother who died of AIDS.  But one can only hope that we're not being treated to the best of the on-stage material here.  For if truth be told, there aren't nearly as many laughs to be gleaned from these performances as one might expect given the caliber of talent involved.  At best, the routines elicit a few hearty chuckles, along with a surprising number of humor-deprived dead spots.  The behind-the-scenes activities are marginally more entertaining (the interviews with the boys' families are sometimes quite informative and amusing), but the movie doesn't provide nearly the depth of insight into the world of standup comedy that, say, Jerry Seinfeld's ""Comedian"" did a few years back.Still the guys in the group are likable enough and their camaraderie ultimately becomes infectious, earning the movie at least a lukewarm recommendation, especially for devotees of the subject.",3,uneven material in an affable film,1224633600,"10 22, 2008",2008,1629,"['2005', 'actor', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'gathered', 'together', 'handful', 'comedians', 'Comedy', 'Store', 'Hollywood', 'Ahmed', 'Ahmed', 'John', 'Caparulo', 'Bret', 'Ernst', 'Sebastian', 'Maniscalco', 'built', 'extended', 'stand-up', 'show', 'acts', 'then', 'took', 'road', '30-city-in-30-day', 'whirlwind', 'tour', 'United', 'States', 'starting', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'ending', 'Chicago', '28', 'stops', 'Vaughn', 'also', 'brought', 'few', 'documentary', 'filmmakers', 'ride', 'result', 'being', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'Wild', 'West', 'Comedy', 'Show', 'best', 'fair-to-middling', 'account', 'event.Some', 'backstage', 'stuff', 'moderate', 'interest', 'particularly', 'comics', 'offering', 'free', 'show', 'Hurricane', 'Katrina', 'refugees', 'Ernst', 'touching', 'reflections', 'older', 'brother', 'who', 'died', 'AIDS', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'hope', ""'re"", 'not', 'being', 'treated', 'best', 'on-stage', 'material', 'here', 'truth', 'be', 'told', 'are', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'many', 'laughs', 'be', 'gleaned', 'performances', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'given', 'caliber', 'talent', 'involved', 'best', 'routines', 'elicit', 'few', 'hearty', 'chuckles', 'surprising', 'number', 'humor-deprived', 'dead', 'spots', 'behind-the-scenes', 'activities', 'are', 'marginally', 'more', 'entertaining', 'interviews', 'boys', 'families', 'are', 'sometimes', 'quite', 'informative', 'amusing', 'movie', ""n't"", 'provide', 'nearly', 'depth', 'insight', 'world', 'standup', 'comedy', 'say', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'Comedian', 'did', 'few', 'years', 'guys', 'group', 'are', 'likable', 'enough', 'camaraderie', 'ultimately', 'infectious', 'earning', 'movie', 'least', 'lukewarm', 'recommendation', 'especially', 'devotees', 'subject']",Vince Vaughn's Wild West Comedy Show: 30 Days & 30 Nights - Hollywood to the Heartland
1137598,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B0012KHOOC,Scott Schiefelbein,"[1, 1]","Talk about an outstanding premise!  Vince Vaughn, one of the most reliably-funny comic actors of his time, gives you a back-stage pass as he leads a bunch of young, talented comics on a thirty-shows-in-thirty-days romp across the country.  Vaughn clearly knows funny, and the homage to Buffalo Bill's old wild west shows promises an instant classic.Unfortunately, that promise remains largely undelivered, for the sad fact is that the four comics Vaughn showcases are, well, not all that funny.  You can see the equivalent in virtually any college town on a Friday night, and that isn't good enough to carry this film.  The sad thing is that these four guys all see themselves as great comics.  One of them even complains that, given his credentials, he should be headlining big concerts ""like the guys in the '80s.""  If he's comparing himself to the comic rock stars of that era - Steve Martin, Richard Pryor, Billy Crystal, Robin Williams, Steven Wright, or (God help him) Eddie Murphy, the guy is living in a world all his own.  The stand-up comic giants of the '80s sold out stadiums because they were so funny you were imitating their routines weeks later.  There's nothing on this DVD that rises to the level of comic gold.Unless, that is, you're a Vince Vaughn fan.  This guy somehow balances his comic genius with an ordinary-guy sensibility so that you never begrudge him his vast success.  It's clear that Vaughn appreciates where he is and never forgets his humble beginnings.  So it's a great treat to see him working with old friends, like Jon Favreau and Peter Billingsly. One of the most charming moments in the film comes when Vaughn and Billingsly reprise a scene from an after-school special they made about steroid abuse in their younger days - it's a scene both funny and touching.So for every scene where Vaughn reels us in, whether it's talking about the legacy of Buck Owens or riffing with Dwight Yoakam, there are several scenes of young comics just not being all that funny.  And so it is that this movie rides into the sunset with a mediocre review.  So sad.At least it looks like the guys had a lot of fun making it.",3,Terrific concept doesn't measure up - comics just ain't funny enough,1228521600,"12 6, 2008",2008,2144,"['Talk', 'outstanding', 'premise', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'one', 'most', 'reliably-funny', 'comic', 'actors', 'time', 'back-stage', 'pass', 'bunch', 'young', 'talented', 'comics', 'thirty-shows-in-thirty-days', 'romp', 'country', 'Vaughn', 'clearly', 'funny', 'homage', 'Buffalo', 'Bill', 'old', 'wild', 'west', 'instant', 'classic.Unfortunately', 'promise', 'largely', 'undelivered', 'sad', 'fact', 'four', 'comics', 'Vaughn', 'showcases', 'are', 'well', 'not', 'funny', 'can', 'see', 'equivalent', 'virtually', 'college', 'town', 'Friday', 'night', ""n't"", 'good', 'enough', 'carry', 'film', 'sad', 'thing', 'four', 'guys', 'see', 'great', 'comics', 'One', 'even', 'given', 'credentials', 'should', 'be', 'headlining', 'big', 'concerts', 'guys', ""'80s"", 'comparing', 'comic', 'rock', 'stars', 'era', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Steven', 'Wright', 'God', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'guy', 'living', 'world', 'own', 'stand-up', 'comic', 'giants', ""'80s"", 'sold', 'out', 'stadiums', 'were', 'so', 'funny', 'were', 'imitating', 'routines', 'weeks', 'later', 'nothing', 'DVD', 'level', 'comic', 'gold.Unless', ""'re"", 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'fan', 'guy', 'somehow', 'comic', 'genius', 'ordinary-guy', 'sensibility', 'never', 'begrudge', 'vast', 'success', 'clear', 'Vaughn', 'where', 'never', 'humble', 'beginnings', 'great', 'treat', 'see', 'working', 'old', 'friends', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'Peter', 'Billingsly', 'One', 'most', 'charming', 'moments', 'film', 'when', 'Vaughn', 'Billingsly', 'reprise', 'scene', 'after-school', 'special', 'made', 'steroid', 'abuse', 'younger', 'days', 'scene', 'funny', 'touching.So', 'scene', 'where', 'Vaughn', 'talking', 'legacy', 'Buck', 'Owens', 'riffing', 'Dwight', 'Yoakam', 'are', 'several', 'scenes', 'young', 'comics', 'just', 'not', 'being', 'funny', 'movie', 'sunset', 'mediocre', 'review', 'So', 'sad.At', 'least', 'guys', 'had', 'lot', 'fun', 'making']",Vince Vaughn's Wild West Comedy Show: 30 Days & 30 Nights - Hollywood to the Heartland

1137600,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B0012KHOOC,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[2, 4]","In 2005 Vince Vaughn decided to recreate a Rat Pack assemblage of improvised sketches and comedy sets involving some of the greatest talents from the L.A. Comedy Store. He decided to tour 30 cities across the Midwest and bring a variety show to places that typically didn't see huge performances - a slice of high-quality entertainment outside of the New York area. With special musical and guest appearances, sensational variety show performances and hilarious comic acts, Vince Vaughn's Wild West Comedy Show is a must-see documentary that takes audiences from a variety of venues to behind-the-scenes moments of the 30 day non-stop event.Vince Vaughn hosts each variety show, introducing guest stars Justin Long, Jon Favreau, Keir O'Donnell (the gay, reclusive painter from Wedding Crashers), Peter Billingsley (Ralphie from A Christmas Story) and many others, performs in various skits, and then introduces four hand-picked comedians who each do their routine. Ahmed Ahmed, of Egyptian descent, raised in Riverside, California, opens each stand-up segment and musters great laughter with his edgy take on Arabs and the racial profiling that he witnesses and has been a victim to. Many of his jokes are based on real-life experiences, including his incarceration at an airport with a police record stating his offense was ""Airport Rules"". Initially unsupported by his parents, Ahmed stuck with his passion for comedy and his love of movies and can be seen in the upcoming films You Don't Mess with the Zohan and Iron Man.Comedian John Caparulo distinguishes himself with an extraordinarily foul mouth and sarcastic temperament, and is easily one of the funniest stand-up performers around. Taking stabs at cable TV men, porn and intelligent dogs, his acerbic brand of humor is ruthlessly witty. During the 30 day tour, two of the shows had to be kept clean for reserved audiences, and John had particular difficulty with his excessive language, and uproariously found himself cutting of the punchlines of jokes that concluded inappropriately. ""It's a really cool thing to have a job that's cathartic,"" he says, thankful for the opportunity to be working with such an elite coterie of performers.Bret Ernst is the most animated of the foursome, and does a staggeringly accurate bit on skating rinks and the cool kids that have all the moves versus the kids who use the appalling rental skates. Italian waiter-turned-comedian Sebastian Maniscalco delivers maddeningly humorous ribs at Ross stores, apple martinis and girls in bars.Instead of merely presenting footage from the different cities and performances, Vince Vaughn's Wild West Comedy Show takes it a step further and fuses a reality-TV behind-the-scenes camera to all of the interactions leading up to the stage, as well as afterwards. Pranks on the tour bus and the stressful condition of sharing a room with four guys is continually displayed, often contributing to the blurring of acts throughout the venues. At times the group gets fed up with the claustrophobia of it all, but ultimately it's a once-in-a-lifetime experience that everyone would ardently repeat.While some cities barely get touched upon at all, and several sketches are shown only in brief montages, the film enlightens audiences well beyond a simple stand-up routine. When the group changes its course due to storms, and then proposes to offer benefit shows for survivors of Rita and Katrina, a touching additional side of humanity and cooperation is manifested that makes this collection of stars much more than ordinary performers. Bringing laughter to those in dire situations is a noble act that certainly isn't unappreciated - laughter proves to be the best medicine, and everyone involved is clearly bettered for having participated in this unique and colossal road show.- Mike Massie",4,Vince Vaughn's Wild West Comedy Show Movie Review,1202947200,"02 14, 2008",2008,3823,"['2005', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'decided', 'recreate', 'Rat', 'Pack', 'assemblage', 'improvised', 'sketches', 'comedy', 'sets', 'involving', 'greatest', 'talents', 'L.A', 'Comedy', 'Store', 'decided', 'tour', '30', 'cities', 'Midwest', 'bring', 'variety', 'show', 'places', 'typically', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'huge', 'performances', 'slice', 'high-quality', 'entertainment', 'New', 'York', 'area', 'special', 'musical', 'guest', 'appearances', 'sensational', 'variety', 'show', 'performances', 'hilarious', 'comic', 'acts', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'Wild', 'West', 'Comedy', 'Show', 'must-see', 'documentary', 'audiences', 'variety', 'venues', 'behind-the-scenes', 'moments', '30', 'day', 'non-stop', 'event.Vince', 'Vaughn', 'variety', 'show', 'introducing', 'guest', 'stars', 'Justin', 'Long', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'Keir', ""O'Donnell"", 'gay', 'reclusive', 'painter', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'Peter', 'Billingsley', 'Ralphie', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Story', 'many', 'others', 'performs', 'various', 'skits', 'then', 'introduces', 'four', 'hand-picked', 'comedians', 'who', 'do', 'routine', 'Ahmed', 'Ahmed', 'Egyptian', 'descent', 'raised', 'Riverside', 'California', 'stand-up', 'segment', 'musters', 'great', 'laughter', 'edgy', 'take', 'Arabs', 'racial', 'profiling', 'been', 'victim', 'Many', 'jokes', 'are', 'based', 'real-life', 'experiences', 'including', 'incarceration', 'airport', 'police', 'record', 'stating', 'offense', 'was', 'Airport', 'Rules', 'Initially', 'unsupported', 'parents', 'Ahmed', 'stuck', 'passion', 'comedy', 'love', 'movies', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'upcoming', 'films', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Mess', 'Zohan', 'Iron', 'Man.Comedian', 'John', 'Caparulo', 'extraordinarily', 'foul', 'mouth', 'sarcastic', 'temperament', 'easily', 'one', 'funniest', 'stand-up', 'performers', 'Taking', 'stabs', 'cable', 'TV', 'men', 'porn', 'intelligent', 'dogs', 'acerbic', 'brand', 'humor', 'ruthlessly', 'witty', '30', 'day', 'tour', 'two', 'shows', 'had', 'be', 'kept', 'clean', 'reserved', 'audiences', 'John', 'had', 'particular', 'difficulty', 'excessive', 'language', 'uproariously', 'found', 'cutting', 'punchlines', 'jokes', 'concluded', 'inappropriately', 'really', 'cool', 'thing', 'have', 'job', 'cathartic', 'thankful', 'opportunity', 'be', 'working', 'elite', 'coterie', 'performers.Bret', 'Ernst', 'most', 'animated', 'foursome', 'staggeringly', 'accurate', 'bit', 'skating', 'rinks', 'cool', 'kids', 'have', 'moves', 'versus', 'kids', 'who', 'use', 'appalling', 'rental', 'skates', 'Italian', 'waiter-turned-comedian', 'Sebastian', 'Maniscalco', 'delivers', 'maddeningly', 'humorous', 'ribs', 'Ross', 'stores', 'apple', 'martinis', 'girls', 'bars.Instead', 'merely', 'presenting', 'footage', 'different', 'cities', 'performances', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'Wild', 'West', 'Comedy', 'Show', 'step', 'further', 'reality-TV', 'behind-the-scenes', 'camera', 'interactions', 'leading', 'up', 'stage', 'as', 'well', 'afterwards', 'Pranks', 'tour', 'bus', 'stressful', 'condition', 'sharing', 'room', 'four', 'guys', 'continually', 'displayed', 'often', 'contributing', 'blurring', 'acts', 'venues', 'times', 'group', 'fed', 'up', 'claustrophobia', 'ultimately', 'once-in-a-lifetime', 'experience', 'everyone', 'would', 'ardently', 'repeat.While', 'cities', 'barely', 'get', 'touched', 'several', 'sketches', 'are', 'shown', 'only', 'brief', 'montages', 'film', 'audiences', 'well', 'simple', 'stand-up', 'routine', 'When', 'group', 'course', 'due', 'storms', 'then', 'offer', 'benefit', 'shows', 'survivors', 'Rita', 'Katrina', 'touching', 'additional', 'side', 'humanity', 'cooperation', 'manifested', 'collection', 'stars', 'much', 'more', 'ordinary', 'performers', 'Bringing', 'laughter', 'dire', 'situations', 'noble', 'act', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'unappreciated', 'laughter', 'be', 'best', 'medicine', 'everyone', 'involved', 'clearly', 'bettered', 'having', 'participated', 'unique', 'colossal', 'road', 'show.-', 'Mike', 'Massie']",Vince Vaughn's Wild West Comedy Show: 30 Days & 30 Nights - Hollywood to the Heartland
