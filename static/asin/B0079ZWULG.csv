1528818,A2582KMXLK2P06,B0079ZWULG,B. E Jackson,"[0, 1]","Junkyard Dog has a slight low budget feel initially, but improves after a while.  It's actually a really enticing thriller and I'm totally surprised because I didn't think I'd be able to look past the bad acting in the beginning.  I do, however.  It's about a young girl who's kidnapped by a psychotic tow guy after she experiences car troubles.  How crazy *is* this guy you wonder?  Why, after he kidnaps people, he stores them in his basement and only lets them out when it's time to eat... and what do they eat?  Why, people meat on a supper plate.  Ewwww!!  haha.  Yes little darling, that meat *does* taste weird.  But... apparently it's healthy to eat human meat.  It apparently fattens up the victims so they taste juicy when it's time for them to be cooked. :)The setting is ideal.  The middle of nowhere somewhere in the country so nobody would suspect a THING is going on in that mans basement.  Oh sure his personality is strange but... it's not convincing enough to suspect killings are secretly occurring on his property.  Also, the film has plenty of atmosphere and decent storytelling.  The German Shepherd was pretty good too.  Of course we have to ignore the occasional times that he wags his tail.  Yes he's happy- not a vicious dog, haha.  The segment where the one cop says it's the biggest dog he's ever seen... nah, I've seen German Shepherds even bigger.  MUCH bigger.Eventually an FBI agent comes to the small town to investigate the circumstances of a missing girl, and this makes the already good enough storyline even better.  I really enjoy this movie overall.  However I can't help but notice the psychotic kidnapper was sort of generous to the girl.  Given his history of tormenting, butchering, draining the blood and ultimately killing his victims, he seems pretty nice towards the girl he keeps in his basement.  She was sort of getting the better of him on several occasions but... he didn't seem to mind.  He just went back upstairs and forgot about it.  What?Overall, quality horror movie with occasional moments of low budget acting becoming a distraction.  Otherwise, highly recommended.",4,meaner than the junkyard dog,1365638400,"04 11, 2013",2013,2125,"['Junkyard', 'Dog', 'slight', 'low', 'budget', 'feel', 'initially', 'while', 'actually', 'really', 'enticing', 'thriller', ""'m"", 'totally', 'surprised', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', ""'d"", 'be', 'able', 'look', 'bad', 'acting', 'beginning', 'do', 'however', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'kidnapped', 'psychotic', 'tow', 'guy', 'car', 'troubles', 'How', 'crazy', '*is*', 'guy', 'wonder', 'Why', 'people', 'stores', 'basement', 'only', 'out', 'when', 'time', 'eat', 'what', 'do', 'eat', 'Why', 'people', 'meat', 'supper', 'plate', 'Ewwww', 'haha', 'Yes', 'little', 'darling', 'meat', '*does*', 'taste', 'weird', 'apparently', 'healthy', 'eat', 'human', 'meat', 'apparently', 'up', 'victims', 'taste', 'juicy', 'when', 'time', 'be', 'cooked', 'setting', 'ideal', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'somewhere', 'country', 'nobody', 'would', 'suspect', 'THING', 'going', 'mans', 'basement', 'Oh', 'sure', 'personality', 'strange', 'not', 'convincing', 'enough', 'suspect', 'killings', 'are', 'secretly', 'occurring', 'property', 'Also', 'film', 'plenty', 'atmosphere', 'decent', 'storytelling', 'German', 'Shepherd', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'too', 'course', 'have', 'ignore', 'occasional', 'times', 'tail', 'happy-', 'not', 'vicious', 'dog', 'haha', 'segment', 'where', 'one', 'cop', 'biggest', 'dog', 'ever', 'seen', 'nah', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'German', 'Shepherds', 'even', 'bigger', 'MUCH', 'bigger.Eventually', 'FBI', 'agent', 'small', 'town', 'investigate', 'circumstances', 'missing', 'girl', 'already', 'good', 'enough', 'storyline', 'even', 'better', 'really', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'overall', 'However', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'notice', 'psychotic', 'kidnapper', 'was', 'sort', 'generous', 'girl', 'Given', 'history', 'tormenting', 'butchering', 'draining', 'blood', 'ultimately', 'killing', 'victims', 'pretty', 'nice', 'girl', 'basement', 'was', 'sort', 'getting', 'better', 'several', 'occasions', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'mind', 'just', 'went', 'back', 'upstairs', 'forgot', 'What', 'Overall', 'quality', 'horror', 'movie', 'occasional', 'moments', 'low', 'budget', 'acting', 'becoming', 'distraction', 'Otherwise', 'highly', 'recommended']",Junkyard Dog

Come on, Vivica, you can do better than this!  Sorry to say, but the dog was the best actor in the entire film.  I'm not an expert on serial killers, but I would think he would have killed the girl longer ago than he did for all the trouble she caused him.  I'll throw it a bone, so to speak, and say that the movie succeeded in being gross and disturbing.  Other than that, I found the entire scenario hard to swallow, much like his ""dinners,"" and the only one I felt any real emotional bond with was the dog.  That's saying something right there.  Watch it if you want, but if you think this movie is anywhere close to good where serial killers are concerned, this must be the first one you've ever seen.",2,Junkyard Script.,1342224000,"07 14, 2012",2012,839,"['watched', 'yesterday', 'thought', 'was', 'entertaining', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'dialog', 'was', 'worst', 'acting', 'unbelievably', 'bad', 'Come', 'Vivica', 'can', 'do', 'better', 'Sorry', 'say', 'dog', 'was', 'best', 'actor', 'entire', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'expert', 'serial', 'killers', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'killed', 'girl', 'longer', 'ago', 'did', 'trouble', 'caused', ""'ll"", 'throw', 'bone', 'so', 'speak', 'say', 'movie', 'succeeded', 'being', 'gross', 'disturbing', 'Other', 'found', 'entire', 'scenario', 'hard', 'swallow', 'much', 'dinners', 'only', 'one', 'felt', 'real', 'emotional', 'bond', 'was', 'dog', 'saying', 'something', 'right', 'there', 'Watch', 'want', 'think', 'movie', 'anywhere', 'close', 'good', 'where', 'serial', 'killers', 'are', 'concerned', 'must', 'be', 'first', 'one', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen']",Junkyard Dog
1528821,A33EN2ZL2MS0CI,B0079ZWULG,Compay,"[2, 3]","Once in a while, a horror fan can stumble across a hidden gem at Redbox. Junkyard Dog is not one of them. A weak story and over-acting plague what could have otherwise been a decent low-budget serial killer flick.Junkyard Dog is about a cannibalistic serial rapist that preys upon young women in rural Tennessee, until he is discovered by an FBI agent looking to redeem herself after a lapse in her career.Despite being filmed with a low-budget, the set design of Junkyard Dog is decent, as well as the visuals and color correction. But that's not enough to save the film. Most of the actors in the movie go way over the top in their performances. I've been a fan of Vivica Fox for over 15 years now, yet she sadly gives a ""so where's my check"" acting job in this one. Film veteran Brad Dourif has his name opposite Fox on the DVD cover, but he gets maybe a grand total of five minutes of screen time.The story is neither original nor particularly memorable. Some of the scenes, such as FBI Agent Samantha Deatherage interrupting a country hoe-down, are so bad they're laughable.  If you're a gore hound, there are no real scenes of killing or torture a la Hostel, only scenes that reveal the killer and his captive munching on stir-fried human meat. There are numerous rape scenes, which I could have lived without.  The film is also billed as being inspired by real events, although no amount of searching online actually reveals what those supposed events were.Writer and director Kim Bass had a terrific career writing for In Living Color, Sister Sister, and Kenan & Kel. So it's bizarre that such a successful writer who made those 90's TV shows popular would try his hand at horror flicks. I honestly couldn't recommend that anyone give this one a rent, let alone buy the DVD. It's also worth pointing out that EVERY five-star review for this movie on Amazon was written by someone who only reviewed one product: this DVD.

1528822,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B0079ZWULG,Michael Butts,"[0, 1]","Allegedly based on ""true events"", JUNKYARD DOG is an occasionally enjoyable look at a psychotic serial killer who also likes digesting his prey.  Posing as a good samaritan tow truck driver, JYD kidnaps, rapes, tortures and prepares his victims as his dinner.  He is aided by his vicious German shepherd who gets rewarded with chunks of JYD's victims.The always unreliable and inept FBI is embodied by Viveca A. Fox, who deservedly seems embarrassed in her role.  The scene in the country line-dancing bar is comically staged as well.  Brad Dourif has a small role as the local law enforcement who outclasses the special agent.  Innis Casey plays JYD with haunting stares and an occasional sneer but unconvincing menace.The movie is not overtly graphic and the bloodletting is minimal, a refreshing change from films like the WRONG TURN franchise.As usual, after the finale, there's a quick scene suggesting all is not well.JUNKYARD DOG is not a terrible film, but it won't be long remembered either!",3,JYD FBI LOL,1354665600,"12 5, 2012",2012,1000,"['Allegedly', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'JUNKYARD', 'DOG', 'occasionally', 'enjoyable', 'look', 'psychotic', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'also', 'digesting', 'prey', 'Posing', 'good', 'samaritan', 'tow', 'truck', 'driver', 'JYD', 'kidnaps', 'tortures', 'victims', 'dinner', 'aided', 'vicious', 'German', 'shepherd', 'who', 'rewarded', 'chunks', 'JYD', 'victims.The', 'always', 'unreliable', 'inept', 'FBI', 'embodied', 'Viveca', 'A', 'Fox', 'who', 'deservedly', 'embarrassed', 'role', 'scene', 'country', 'line-dancing', 'bar', 'comically', 'staged', 'as', 'well', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'small', 'role', 'local', 'law', 'enforcement', 'who', 'special', 'agent', 'Innis', 'Casey', 'JYD', 'haunting', 'stares', 'occasional', 'sneer', 'unconvincing', 'menace.The', 'movie', 'not', 'overtly', 'graphic', 'bloodletting', 'minimal', 'refreshing', 'change', 'films', 'WRONG', 'TURN', 'franchise.As', 'usual', 'finale', 'quick', 'scene', 'suggesting', 'not', 'well.JUNKYARD', 'DOG', 'not', 'terrible', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'long', 'remembered', 'either']",Junkyard Dog
