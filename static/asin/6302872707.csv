342136,A2FL0EKQ2EQ9E6,6302872707,"a viewer ""a viewer""","[7, 7]","This film is significant because it was Jeanette MacDonald's final film.  While she is lovely to look at, the picture really belongs to the charming and affable Claude Jarman, Jr. who sprouted up in height since making ""The Yearling"" three years before.  Lassie is on the periphery here as well.  This is the story of a concert singer (MacDonald) who has a nervous breakdown after her only son is hit by a truck and killed trying to save ""Lassie"".  She retreats to a mountain village where there is an orphan's home nearby.  She hires one of the ""orphan"" boys (Jarman, Jr.) whose name is Jerry, to be her handy boy.  He is about the same age as her son who was killed was.  They form a mutual attachment and overcome many obstacles.  This is a great family film, photographed beautifully in Technicolor.  Sure its sentimental and touchy-feely and definitely not for the cynics.  But MacDonald and Claude Jarman Jr. have great chemistry together.  Lassie is the forgotten link between the two.  This is a film that the entire family can enjoy without worrying about ""bad language"", ""sex"" or ""violence"".  Yes, indeed, I reckon this movie's a bargain because of that!",5,I RECKON THIS MOVIE'S A BARGAIN!!!!,1138579200,"01 30, 2006",2006,1164,"['film', 'significant', 'was', 'Jeanette', 'MacDonald', 'final', 'film', 'lovely', 'look', 'picture', 'really', 'charming', 'affable', 'Claude', 'Jarman', 'Jr.', 'who', 'sprouted', 'up', 'height', 'making', 'Yearling', 'three', 'years', 'Lassie', 'periphery', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'story', 'concert', 'singer', 'MacDonald', 'who', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'only', 'son', 'hit', 'truck', 'killed', 'trying', 'save', 'Lassie', 'mountain', 'village', 'where', 'orphan', 'home', 'nearby', 'one', 'orphan', 'boys', 'Jarman', 'Jr.', 'name', 'Jerry', 'be', 'handy', 'boy', 'same', 'age', 'son', 'who', 'was', 'killed', 'was', 'form', 'mutual', 'attachment', 'overcome', 'many', 'obstacles', 'great', 'family', 'film', 'photographed', 'beautifully', 'Technicolor', 'Sure', 'sentimental', 'touchy-feely', 'definitely', 'not', 'cynics', 'MacDonald', 'Claude', 'Jarman', 'Jr.', 'have', 'great', 'chemistry', 'together', 'Lassie', 'forgotten', 'link', 'two', 'film', 'entire', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy', 'worrying', 'bad', 'language', 'sex', 'violence', 'Yes', 'indeed', 'reckon', 'movie', 'bargain']",N/A
