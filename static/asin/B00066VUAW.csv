861899,A3UKTNO55W5JFZ,B00066VUAW,Fillis,"[0, 0]","I enjoyed this movie because it really could have been about any family. It had all the essential ingredience. Love between parents and child, greed, conflict within the family and within one's self, death and regret and disappointment and a happy ending of finally finding what(to some extent) you're looking for. The acting was very well done. Eartha Kitt had a great air of sexual appeal without being over the top or looking like she was trying to hard. It looked natural and yet you saw her characters vulnerablity and old fashion standard needs in one (which I believe is in most of us) Sammmy Davis character was really different for him. No singing or dancing(for audience entertainment) only briefly connecting to the storyline. You liked him and you saw the same mixture of character in him as in ANNA, so one could see WHY they originally got together and you felt at the end he would attain what ANNA eventually did. Someone who loved her for herself. I enjoyed the movie. It was a telling STORY, with all the elements to make it POP. It was the various characters that made it  flow, without each ones role it wouldn't have made it as interesting as it was.",5,My Opinion,1337040000,"05 15, 2012",2012,1170,"['enjoyed', 'movie', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'family', 'had', 'essential', 'ingredience', 'Love', 'parents', 'child', 'greed', 'conflict', 'family', 'one', 'self', 'death', 'regret', 'disappointment', 'happy', 'ending', 'finally', 'finding', 'what', 'extent', ""'re"", 'looking', 'acting', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Eartha', 'Kitt', 'had', 'great', 'air', 'sexual', 'appeal', 'being', 'top', 'looking', 'was', 'trying', 'hard', 'looked', 'natural', 'yet', 'saw', 'characters', 'vulnerablity', 'old', 'fashion', 'standard', 'one', 'believe', 'most', 'Sammmy', 'Davis', 'character', 'was', 'really', 'different', 'singing', 'dancing', 'audience', 'entertainment', 'only', 'connecting', 'storyline', 'liked', 'saw', 'same', 'mixture', 'character', 'ANNA', 'one', 'could', 'see', 'WHY', 'originally', 'got', 'together', 'felt', 'end', 'would', 'attain', 'what', 'ANNA', 'eventually', 'did', 'Someone', 'who', 'loved', 'herself', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'was', 'telling', 'STORY', 'elements', 'make', 'POP', 'was', 'various', 'characters', 'made', 'flow', 'ones', 'role', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'made', 'as', 'interesting', 'was']",Anna Lucasta

(Recommended very much)  This ""play"" was listed as one of the plays the young Sydney Poitier played in in summer stock.

The acting is superb,  the story is very involving,  the writing is clever, and the star power of Eartha Kitt and Sammy Davis Jr. is strong.

861903,A1GF7BR6K22GZD,B00066VUAW,Mark Norvell,"[53, 53]","A bitter, alcoholic ""religious"" father has an unnatural hatred for his wayward daughter Anna (Eartha Kitt) and when his greedy family hatches a plan to marry her off for money to the college graduate son of an old family friend, the old man nearly has a seizure. But he's brow-beaten into retrieving her by his scheming son-in-law. The father drove Anna out of the house years ago due to her alleged promiscuity and she's now a waterfront prostitute and the sometime girlfriend of sailor Danny (Sammy Davis Jr.). She's down-and-out so she reluctantly returns home with her father. But the unexpected happens and she falls in love with the young college man. Then the stuff hits the fan as the wedding day draws near as the father has plans of his own. Based on Philip Yordan's play, this b&w adaptation is juicy and well acted. Kitt is good as Anna and Davis Jr. matches her as the footloose Danny. The entire cast is in tune with the tone of the script and the underlying theme (incest) surfaces despite the restrictions of the time. Davis sings the title song and even gets to show off his dancing skills. The DVD looks good and is worth a look for those interested in rare, unusual films. Very adult for the time and very well done all around.

861904,A2JTK7ZFN02W9A,B00066VUAW,Mark S. Crawford,"[0, 0]","This is a well made movie. Yes, some of the production value dates the movie, and we know the actors are either no longer acting or deceased, but the script is good and there is solid acting.For those who only know Eartha Kitt from the 60's ""Batman"" series owe it to themselves to see her in this role. Sammy Davis, Jr., doesn't have much screen time, but he is nonetheless convincing. The rest of the cast is solid, and makes for a good ensemble.I can't help but think this movie must have been somewhat progressive for the late 50's. Considering this was a high production movie released in 1958 and featured an all African American cast, it must have caused some ""buzz"" for the studio. Regardless, the movie stands on its own merits.
