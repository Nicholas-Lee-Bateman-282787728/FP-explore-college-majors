1165346,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,B001A7GODO,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[10, 11]","This film is a very disappointing outing.  It's a rather contrived, badly plotted film about a corporate manager who is transferred to London to oversee a merger, and gets the shaft by the title character.  While there are a few funny passages in the film, there are a lot of very dull stretches.  Most of the dialogue is expository, resulting in a film with absolutely no narrative flow.  It plods from one setpiece to another, and ends up being an absolute chore to finish.  Much of the slapstick quality of it feels forced, and it feels like a sitcom where logic and character development go straight out the window.  The character's motivation make little to no sense at all.  It's one of the most paper thin scripts I've ever seen in a movie.There are some good things about it.  It has an excellent cast.  Alan Rickman is good as usual, and Janeane Garofalo is very good here, despite her character being underwritten.  It's nice to see her play a relatively normal person here instead of the dumpy romantic lead or the sarcastic chick.  Her character here has some sarcastic dialogue, but there's some tenderness there as well, a side she rarely shows in her work.  Mike Binder wrote, directed, and stars in the film, and has good screen presence and good chemistry with Garofalo.  His writing, however, is very poor and the flashy direction is annoying.  The flashy direction seems to be compensating for the fact that the source material is so flimsy to being with.  Juliet Stevenson, Allan Courdiner, and Nigel Terry (all excellent actors) are wasted in roles that end up being caricatures, and there's a silly plot involving a fake nun.  The film never got a release stateside, and only recently got released to DVD.  It's easy to see why.",2,"Disappointing, boring, and a chore to sit through...",1228262400,"12 3, 2008",2008,1750,"['film', 'very', 'disappointing', 'outing', 'rather', 'contrived', 'badly', 'plotted', 'film', 'corporate', 'manager', 'who', 'transferred', 'London', 'oversee', 'merger', 'shaft', 'title', 'character', 'are', 'few', 'funny', 'passages', 'film', 'are', 'lot', 'very', 'dull', 'stretches', 'Most', 'dialogue', 'expository', 'resulting', 'film', 'absolutely', 'narrative', 'flow', 'one', 'setpiece', 'up', 'being', 'absolute', 'chore', 'finish', 'Much', 'slapstick', 'quality', 'forced', 'sitcom', 'where', 'logic', 'character', 'development', 'go', 'straight', 'out', 'window', 'character', 'motivation', 'make', 'little', 'sense', 'one', 'most', 'paper', 'thin', 'scripts', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'movie.There', 'are', 'good', 'things', 'excellent', 'cast', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'good', 'usual', 'Janeane', 'Garofalo', 'very', 'good', 'here', 'character', 'being', 'underwritten', 'nice', 'see', 'play', 'relatively', 'normal', 'person', 'here', 'instead', 'dumpy', 'romantic', 'lead', 'sarcastic', 'chick', 'character', 'here', 'sarcastic', 'dialogue', 'tenderness', 'there', 'as', 'well', 'side', 'rarely', 'work', 'Mike', 'Binder', 'wrote', 'directed', 'stars', 'film', 'good', 'screen', 'presence', 'good', 'chemistry', 'Garofalo', 'writing', 'however', 'very', 'poor', 'flashy', 'direction', 'annoying', 'flashy', 'direction', 'be', 'compensating', 'fact', 'source', 'material', 'so', 'flimsy', 'being', 'Juliet', 'Stevenson', 'Allan', 'Courdiner', 'Nigel', 'Terry', 'excellent', 'actors', 'are', 'wasted', 'roles', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'caricatures', 'silly', 'plot', 'involving', 'fake', 'nun', 'film', 'never', 'got', 'release', 'stateside', 'only', 'recently', 'got', 'released', 'DVD', 'easy', 'see', 'why']",The Search for John Gissing

1165351,A2KTT44JND0AZI,B001A7GODO,Laurie,"[14, 14]","This movie has the fatal stench of ""vanity project."" To be an ambitious actor of unknown quality is to be an actor who has to write a movie for himself, then has to direct it so he can cast himself. Mike Binder is the actor/writer/director who knitted this series of cliches and old Neil Simon together as a gift to his own career. No one told him that ""The Out of Towners"" had been made some 30 years ago, and even the much, much more likable and talented Jack Lemmon couldn't make its irritating plot tolerable. No one told Mike Binder that there is only gonna be one Ben Stiller. So hopeful he is to be Ben Stiller that he even fetched one of Ben Stiller's former company members, Janeane Garafolo, to play his wife. As the wife, she gets to complain a lot, follow her man from port to port while having no other wish for herself than to settle down and give birth to his children. When you write your own husband role, you get to make yourself a wife like that-- one who's nearly as focused on you as you are.The writing and directing are uninspired and often lazy. Mike Binder's acting, that present he created for himself, is indeed a watered down Stiller imitation. Unlike his role model, he does run around a lot, which seems to be his acting shorthand for funny. There's his writer/director mediocre attempt to make secondary characters lovably kooky, but by golly, they are poorly realized, never engaging or endearing, just thrown in because, hey, that's what Ben Stiller would do. Mike Binder doesn't seem to have the skill set to make what he's attempting work, hard as he tries to mimic other well-worn comic formulas.Binder's more self-brutalizing mistake is one even actor/writer/director Kevin Costner made-- allowing himself to be measured against Alan Rickman. Again, why didn't anyone tell him? You cannot out perform Alan Rickman. Rickman is lightly used in the first half of the movie, then dominates the last half. He seems to relish his chance at screwball comedy, and he plays what he's given with deft delight. Although he is the root of all the Binder character's frustrations, Rickman's John Gissing is still the most engagingly appealing character of the bunch.  It's a relief when John Gissing is finally found and begins to occupy real screen time.While Alan Rickman consistently out classes Mike Binder's performance, God bless Alan Rickman's involvement. Without his name on the credits, no one would have sought this movie out. It would have remained with the other vanity projects of needy actors turned writer/directors. Gone. Forgotten-- just the source of the faint sour smell of desperately failed self-promotion wafting up from the bottom of the clearance bin at Blockbusters.",3,"Rickman, yes.

This was almost like a British version of Office Space - except funnier, in that the humor was more highly developed.  Don't get me wrong, I loved Office Space, but this movie has a drier sense of humor about it, which is more along the lines of the humor I love. If you are a fan of British humor, you will love this movie!  For anyone who has ever worked in an office and been made to suffer corporate arrogance and stupidity, this film might give you a few ideas about how to overcome such obstacles, and possibly subvert the system.  Personally, this movie had me laughing out loud until I was in pain in places.Alan Rickman is excellent in this film - I would say the most comical that I have seen him, and that is saying something.  His humor is in that he can play a character that isn't trying to be funny for humor's sake, but rather that his machinations place him in almost absurd situations, and that, in my opinion, is the best kind of humor.  If you are even a fraction of the Alan Rickman fan that I am, then you will LOVE this movie.  Also, be certain to watch the outtakes and deleted scenes, for they are equally amusing.All in all, I was completely stunned that a film this wonderful never seemed to make it into the American radar for film.  But in someways this is a good thing because this movie does not sacrifice its characters to Hollywood glitz.  This is a very character driven film amuses from the first scene right up to the end.  I can't even begin to verbalize how good it was!
