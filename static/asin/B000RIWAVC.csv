1081768,AR3BZOTB7IY78,B000RIWAVC,Anton Karidian,"[5, 6]","I wanted so much to love this miniseries about Elvis, since most other films of his life have been disappointing. And I had heard good things about this miniseries, like the fact that Jonathan Rhys Meyers won the Golden Globe Award for his portrayal of The King. Indeed, the first half goes very well. Meyers does an excellent job of portraying 1950s Elvis, both in terms of capturing his personality as well as in re-creating his stage performances. There is a palpable sense of excitement in Elvis's rise to fame on the cutting edge of rock-and-roll, and a good balance of narrative and music.But for me the second half of the film does not hold up to the quality of the first half. Instead of trying to accurately describe Elvis's life as it really was in the 1960s, the producers adopted the theme that his life was falling apart in the face of doing increasingly bad movies, then they twisted everything to fit into that theme. For instance, Elvis's decision to record the romantic ballad ""It's Now or Never"" when he returned from the Army is suggested to be part of the decline, but in my opinion Elvis was a better singer for being able to sing many styles so well, and the terrificElvis Is Back!companion album that is shown on screen during the discussion of ""It's Now Or Never"" is in fact an eclectic mix of styles. Also, Elvis's heavy drug use that is shown is actually much more a description of Elvis's life in the 1970s. And the Sixties Elvis is depicted as being constantly irritable, which I have never read was really the case. I may be mistaken, but I believe that several of the scenes and conversations in this film did not actually happen, but were fabricated to make some point. And Meyers does not do nearly as good a job in portraying the Sixties Elvis. As, the re-created scenes from the 1968 TV ""Comeback"" special are disappointing compared to the Fifties re-creations. There also is much less music in the second half, and no scenes from the movies are shown. In reality, Elvis's ""comeback"" actually began with his excellent 1967 album of religious songs,How Great Thou Art, and other good studio recordings he did in 1966-68 (check the CDTomorrow Is a Long Time), but the film does not mention those recordings. I can appreciate that the producers were trying to make a point in a very limited amount of time, but still this 1960s segment totally oversimplifies reality to fit into one theme. However, I do think the second half of this film is accurate in describing the decline of Elvis's movie career in the Sixties as being mostly the fault of Elvis's manager, Tom Parker, who cared much more about money than about quality.However, even considering these failings, ELVIS: THE MINISERIES overall is pretty good. As I said, the first half is terrific. I applaude the decision to use Elvis's actual song recordings, rather than the usual practice of hiring an imitator. And overall the performances are good, especially Randy Quaid as the oily and self-serving Tom Parker. This film is OK for Elvis fans to see, but I would not recommend it to those who really want to learn accurately about Elvis. Instead, read the excellent biographiesMe and a Guy Named Elvis: My Lifelong Friendship with Elvis Presleyby Jerry Schilling or the two volume bioLast Train to Memphis Careless Loveby Peter Guralnick. Of course, those books take a lot longer to read than the 3 hours it takes to watch this miniseries!",3,"Fifties Elvis Done Well, Sixties Elvis Oversimplified",1198972800,"12 30, 2007",2007,3430,"['wanted', 'so', 'much', 'love', 'miniseries', 'Elvis', 'most', 'other', 'films', 'life', 'have', 'been', 'disappointing', 'had', 'heard', 'good', 'things', 'miniseries', 'fact', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'won', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Award', 'portrayal', 'King', 'Indeed', 'first', 'half', 'very', 'well', 'Meyers', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', '1950s', 'Elvis', 'terms', 'capturing', 'personality', 'as', 'well', 're-creating', 'stage', 'performances', 'palpable', 'sense', 'excitement', 'Elvis', 'rise', 'fame', 'cutting', 'edge', 'rock-and-roll', 'good', 'balance', 'narrative', 'music.But', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'not', 'hold', 'up', 'quality', 'first', 'half', 'Instead', 'trying', 'accurately', 'describe', 'Elvis', 'life', 'really', 'was', '1960s', 'producers', 'adopted', 'theme', 'life', 'was', 'falling', 'apart', 'face', 'doing', 'increasingly', 'bad', 'movies', 'then', 'twisted', 'everything', 'fit', 'theme', 'instance', 'Elvis', 'decision', 'record', 'romantic', 'ballad', 'Now', 'Never', 'when', 'returned', 'Army', 'suggested', 'be', 'part', 'decline', 'opinion', 'Elvis', 'was', 'better', 'singer', 'being', 'able', 'sing', 'many', 'styles', 'so', 'well', 'terrificElvis', 'Back', 'companion', 'album', 'shown', 'screen', 'discussion', 'Now', 'Never', 'fact', 'eclectic', 'mix', 'styles', 'Also', 'Elvis', 'heavy', 'drug', 'use', 'shown', 'actually', 'much', 'more', 'description', 'Elvis', 'life', '1970s', 'Sixties', 'Elvis', 'depicted', 'being', 'constantly', 'irritable', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'was', 'really', 'case', 'may', 'be', 'mistaken', 'believe', 'several', 'scenes', 'conversations', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'actually', 'happen', 'were', 'fabricated', 'make', 'point', 'Meyers', 'not', 'do', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'Sixties', 'Elvis', 're-created', 'scenes', '1968', 'TV', 'Comeback', 'special', 'are', 'disappointing', 'compared', 'Fifties', 're-creations', 'also', 'much', 'less', 'music', 'second', 'half', 'scenes', 'movies', 'are', 'shown', 'reality', 'Elvis', 'comeback', 'actually', 'began', 'excellent', '1967', 'album', 'religious', 'songs', 'How', 'Great', 'Thou', 'Art', 'other', 'good', 'studio', 'recordings', 'did', '1966-68', 'check', 'CDTomorrow', 'Long', 'Time', 'film', 'not', 'mention', 'recordings', 'can', 'appreciate', 'producers', 'were', 'trying', 'make', 'point', 'very', 'limited', 'amount', 'time', 'still', '1960s', 'segment', 'totally', 'reality', 'fit', 'one', 'theme', 'However', 'do', 'think', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'accurate', 'describing', 'decline', 'Elvis', 'movie', 'career', 'Sixties', 'being', 'mostly', 'fault', 'Elvis', 'manager', 'Tom', 'Parker', 'who', 'cared', 'much', 'more', 'money', 'about', 'quality.However', 'even', 'considering', 'failings', 'ELVIS', 'MINISERIES', 'overall', 'pretty', 'good', 'said', 'first', 'half', 'terrific', 'applaude', 'decision', 'use', 'Elvis', 'actual', 'song', 'recordings', 'rather', 'usual', 'practice', 'hiring', 'imitator', 'overall', 'performances', 'are', 'good', 'especially', 'Randy', 'Quaid', 'oily', 'self-serving', 'Tom', 'Parker', 'film', 'OK', 'Elvis', 'fans', 'see', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'who', 'really', 'want', 'learn', 'accurately', 'Elvis', 'Instead', 'read', 'excellent', 'biographiesMe', 'Guy', 'Named', 'Elvis', 'Lifelong', 'Friendship', 'Elvis', 'Presleyby', 'Jerry', 'Schilling', 'two', 'volume', 'bioLast', 'Train', 'Memphis', 'Careless', 'Loveby', 'Peter', 'Guralnick', 'course', 'books', 'take', 'lot', 'longer', 'read', '3', 'hours', 'watch', 'miniseries']",N/A

They talk about his drugs and his temper too. Still in this movie it's plain to see why don't you stop steppin' on his `blue suede shoes.'With scenes of Memphis and Vegas, Elvis: The Mini-Series makes for a uniquely entertaining movie. We see Elvis as a southern boy, dirt poor, rising up from the dregs of poverty. In the beginning he is agonizing over his '68 comeback special. America is anticipating seeing him in one of his greatest performances. In flashbacks there is a memorable scene as the Presleys are fighting over the last pork chop. It's a scene that sticks out in Elvis' mind. As he rises to fame he defies his father Vernon and the formidable Colonel Tom Parker (Randy Quaid). His mama dies and he blames himself. Still, he never gives up on his dream.Camryn Manheim is all right as Priscilla. Rose McGowan captures Ann-Margaret well. But Jonathan Rhys-Meyers literally explodes on the screen. He looks, acts, and sounds so much like Elvis that it is indeed shocking. He shines especially while performing `Blue Suede Shoes.' But, during the riveting '68 concert scenes there is a bit of a disappointment. Rhys-Meyers doesn't quite capture the real thing, but who can truly imitate Elvis at his absolute best?Elvis sympathized with the less fortunate and gave all that he had to the world before he left us. He had a generous spirit. He lived the American dream. Perhaps that is why we love him and will never forget him. This movie is a must for Elvis fans. He lives on in our hearts. God bless you Elvis.

1081773,A3JNICYJRSVGA9,B000RIWAVC,Comic Online,"[34, 48]","I am a hard-core Elvis fan.  I have every single studio master recording released by the King. I have the Aloha Special & Comeback Special Deluxe Editions, That's The Way It Is, and Elvis By The Presleys.  Nevertheless, because i am about to say something bad about an Elvis product (even though it had nothing to do with the ACTUAL Elvis), i'm sure i'll get a ton of ""not helpful"" votes. Oh well. Here goes.PROS:1). Jonathan Rhys Meyers looks quite a bit like Elvis. In some scenes, almost scarily so.2). Robert Patrick, arguably the most compelling actor in the movie, is great as Elvis' father.CONS:1). While Meyers looks a lot of Elvis,  he doesn't create a compelling character.  As Elvis, he talks about his feelings and how deep he is, but he doesn't really ACT with much passion & depth.  He makes Elvis really come across as one-dimensional.  Compare to Joaquin Phoenix's fantastic performance as Johnny Cash.2). There were not enough scenes of Elvis performing, recording & working on movies.  Look at how much music were in the movies Walk The Line & Ray.3). I know some will find this sacreligious, but please think about it before you click ""not helpful.""  Ok, here goes...  They should NOT have used Presley's original recordings in this movie. While NO imitator would ever be as good as Elvis, using his original recordings in this film creates many problems.............a). Many of Elvis's earliest recordings were not of terribly good sonic quality compared to the audio in a movie produced in 2005. The sonic difference is noticeable, and takes the viewer out of the movie. Instead of feeling like he's watching Elvis record or perform live, the viewer feels like he's just listening to an Elvis record while a guy dances.............b). They used Elvis's studio recordings for many of his live appearances in the mini-series. Everyone on earth is very familiar with Elvis's original recording of Blue Suede Shoes.  If you're an Elvis fan, you might know the pacing and guitar licks note for note. To see a movie where Elvis is supposed to be performing live on stage, and hearing the studio version really takes away from the drama & reality of the situation.  Again, it makes me feel like i'm watching a guy dancing to an Elvis record..............c). Unless he's a great actor, it's difficult to convey the proper drama needed when you lip sync to someone else.  When a singer is actually singing (and a band actually performing, for that matter), there is a connection to the music.  But when you have to just listen to something that's been pre-recorded, and can't add any of your own flare, the focus shifts to technical accuracy, and away from dramatic art & potency.What SHOULD have been done was have an actor who can sing Elvis's songs himself, or have a professional impersonator do all the overdub recordings that could properly mimic live events, in studio singing, etc.  Walk The Line is a PERFECT example of how to do it properly. Did Joaquin Phoenix sound like Johnny Cash when he sang?  A little. Did he LOOK like Cash?  Not really.  But did we buy him as Cash?  YES.  It has been a widely acclaimed film.  Why?  Because aside from being a great actor, he also did all the performances himself.  When you have a scene like Cash's first awkward studio recording at Sun Records, the drama of the scene was heightened by the fact that you had a real actor, actually performing in the studio at the pace necessary, and with the dramatic inflections necessary to make it work.Conversely, the movie Ray worked as well. Why?  Because while Jamie Foxx did lip sync to the real Ray Charles, they did not use old Ray Charles recordings. They took advantage of the fact that Charles was still alive, and he recorded a bunch of tracks of his music made to fit into specific scenes in the movie.Unfortunately, in Elvis: The Mini-Series, the use of stock recordings that clearly don't fit properly in the scene, takes away the drama necessary, takes the viewer out of the movie, makes it more difficult for suspension of disbelief, and reminds the viewer that you're NOT watching Elvis on screen.  And this actor actually LOOKED like Elvis!  Phoenix looked NOTHING like Cash, and only sounded sorta like Cash, yet we BELIEVED he was Cash. Jamie Fox didn't sing in Ray, yet we totally believed it, due to he acting, his looking like Charles, and the fact that the music was actually recorded to fit the scenes, not just dropped in.All this movie made me want to do was to watch the real Elvis in...well, almost anything.  Even Charro.

1081774,A3PPSZB0W5DZH6,B000RIWAVC,"DEWEY M. ""MOVIE & MUSICAL THEATRE MAN""","[5, 5]","This 2005 Elvis Presley biopic was produced with the full cooperation of The Elvis Presley Estate. The production values are extremely high.  Elvis' original, classic recordings are used in numerous musical sequences;  and Irish-born star Jonathan Rhys-Meyers lip-synchs (and gyrates to) these songs to perfection. Rhys-Meyers can't quite match Elvis' charisma/sexuality/sex appeal, but that's an impossible task for any living actor. Rhys-Meyers'  performance also misses the  nuances of Kurt Russell's interpretation (in the 1979 ""Elvis"" biopic). Still, I get the feeling that Rhys-Meyers understands the dark forces behind ""the myth of Elvis"" a bit too well. All things considered, Rhys-Meyers gives an admirable performance; one that earned him a Golden Globe Award for Outstanding Lead Actor, and an Emmy Award nomination in the same category.With the Elvis Presley Estate involved, I expected this to be a fairly sanitized biopic. Far from it. If anything,  the superior script by Patrick Sheane Duncan showcases the darker side of Elvis' life and legend. The dramatic crux here is the gross abuse of Elvis, both personally and professionally, by his manager Colonel Tom Parker, played to poisonous perfection by Randy Quaid (Golden Globe and Emmy Award nominations). Parker clearly saw Elvis as a money-making machine; and he made sure the money never stopped rolling in. Elvis was, consequently, stuck with some silly songs to sing and a lackluster (at best) movie career. Others around Elvis were quick to see right through Parker. Elvis' beloved mother Gladys (a solid Golden Globe and Emmy nominated performance by Camryn Manheim) quickly describes Parker as  the type who would ""sell the paint off his mother's house."" Ann-Margaret (Rose McGowan), Elvis' ""Viva Las Vegas"" co-star,  sums Parker up as a ""bastard."" By 1968, when Elvis himself  finally wises up to Parker's decades-long mis-use and abuse, in a blazing confrontational scene by Rhys-Meyers and Quaid, it is much too late. It isn't that Elvis didn't know what he wanted for himself or how to get it; and it isn't that Elvis couldn't stand up for himself. It is just that he didn't do it often enough. Musically speaking, Elvis is depicted as knowing exactly what he wants. Elvis doesn't care if it takes more than 25 takes to get a song right.  ""You're the boss"",  someone replies. ""If I'm the boss, why don't you get the world off my back?"",  Elvis growls in response.  Elvis  even demands to sing an opera-inpired song, the chart-topping ""It's Now Or Never,"" instead of the standard pop/rock stuff that RCA Records expected from him.This biopic hits its high points when depicting Elvis' rise to fame (the potent mixture of rock and roll and Elvis' naturally strong sexuality caused quite a scandal in 1956) and his growing disenchantment with Hollywood and his movie career. Elvis had a sizzling screen presence. Sadly, only three of his movies, ""Jailhouse Rock"", ""King Creole"" and ""Viva Las Vegas"", are really worth watching.At one point,  Gladys Presley says, ""our kind isn't meant for happiness.""  The biopic takes the position that Elvis took his mother's words and turned them into a self-fullfilling prophecy. Elvis' drug use, that eventually led to his tragic death at age 42 in 1977, is first shown here in an early scene between Elvis and his teen-aged girlfriend Priscilla (Antonia Bernath) and throughout the movie. Elvis is depicted as increasingly mercurial and moody; largely as a result of his drug use, I expect. Rhys-Meyers'  Elvis is much more than frustrated, sad and lonely. He is a tormented soul. It is heartbreaking that Elvis felt so unfulfilled and so unhappy. Yet, Elvis had (and still has) a tremendous impact on music and pop-culture as a whole. With all that, it is interesting to think what Elvis might have achieved had he been allowed to, or more importantly, had he felt secure and self-empowered enough to, chart his own personal and professional course in life.",4,"""THE DARK SIDE OF ELVIS' LIFE AND LEGEND""",1318377600,"10 12, 2011",2011,3973,"['2005', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'biopic', 'was', 'produced', 'full', 'cooperation', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'Estate', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'extremely', 'high', 'Elvis', 'original', 'classic', 'recordings', 'are', 'used', 'numerous', 'musical', 'sequences', 'Irish-born', 'star', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'lip-synchs', 'songs', 'perfection', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'match', 'Elvis', 'charisma/sexuality/sex', 'appeal', 'impossible', 'task', 'living', 'actor', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'performance', 'also', 'nuances', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'interpretation', '1979', 'Elvis', 'biopic', 'Still', 'get', 'feeling', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'dark', 'forces', 'myth', 'Elvis', 'bit', 'too', 'well', 'things', 'considered', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'admirable', 'performance', 'one', 'earned', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Award', 'Outstanding', 'Lead', 'Actor', 'Emmy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'same', 'category.With', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'Estate', 'involved', 'expected', 'be', 'fairly', 'sanitized', 'biopic', 'Far', 'anything', 'superior', 'script', 'Patrick', 'Sheane', 'Duncan', 'darker', 'side', 'Elvis', 'life', 'legend', 'dramatic', 'crux', 'here', 'gross', 'abuse', 'Elvis', 'personally', 'professionally', 'manager', 'Colonel', 'Tom', 'Parker', 'played', 'poisonous', 'perfection', 'Randy', 'Quaid', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Emmy', 'Award', 'nominations', 'Parker', 'clearly', 'saw', 'Elvis', 'money-making', 'machine', 'made', 'sure', 'money', 'never', 'stopped', 'rolling', 'Elvis', 'was', 'consequently', 'stuck', 'silly', 'songs', 'sing', 'lackluster', 'best', 'movie', 'career', 'Others', 'Elvis', 'were', 'quick', 'see', 'right', 'Parker', 'Elvis', 'beloved', 'mother', 'Gladys', 'solid', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Emmy', 'nominated', 'performance', 'Camryn', 'Manheim', 'quickly', 'Parker', 'type', 'who', 'would', 'sell', 'paint', 'off', 'mother', 'house', 'Ann-Margaret', 'Rose', 'McGowan', 'Elvis', 'Viva', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'co-star', 'sums', 'Parker', 'up', 'bastard', '1968', 'when', 'Elvis', 'finally', 'up', 'Parker', 'decades-long', 'mis-use', 'abuse', 'blazing', 'confrontational', 'scene', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'Quaid', 'much', 'too', 'late', ""n't"", 'Elvis', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'wanted', 'how', 'get', ""n't"", 'Elvis', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'up', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'often', 'enough', 'Musically', 'speaking', 'Elvis', 'depicted', 'knowing', 'exactly', 'what', 'Elvis', ""n't"", 'care', 'more', '25', 'get', 'song', 'right', ""'re"", 'boss', 'someone', 'replies', ""'m"", 'boss', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'world', 'back', 'Elvis', 'response', 'Elvis', 'even', 'sing', 'opera-inpired', 'song', 'chart-topping', 'Now', 'Or', 'Never', 'instead', 'standard', 'pop/rock', 'stuff', 'RCA', 'Records', 'expected', 'him.This', 'biopic', 'high', 'points', 'when', 'depicting', 'Elvis', 'rise', 'fame', 'potent', 'mixture', 'rock', 'roll', 'Elvis', 'naturally', 'strong', 'sexuality', 'caused', 'quite', 'scandal', '1956', 'growing', 'disenchantment', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'career', 'Elvis', 'had', 'sizzling', 'screen', 'presence', 'Sadly', 'only', 'three', 'movies', 'Jailhouse', 'Rock', 'King', 'Creole', 'Viva', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'are', 'really', 'worth', 'watching.At', 'one', 'point', 'Gladys', 'Presley', 'kind', ""n't"", 'meant', 'happiness', 'biopic', 'position', 'Elvis', 'took', 'mother', 'words', 'turned', 'self-fullfilling', 'prophecy', 'Elvis', 'drug', 'use', 'eventually', 'led', 'tragic', 'death', 'age', '42', '1977', 'first', 'shown', 'here', 'early', 'scene', 'Elvis', 'teen-aged', 'girlfriend', 'Priscilla', 'Antonia', 'Bernath', 'movie', 'Elvis', 'depicted', 'increasingly', 'mercurial', 'moody', 'largely', 'result', 'drug', 'use', 'expect', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'Elvis', 'much', 'more', 'frustrated', 'sad', 'lonely', 'tormented', 'soul', 'heartbreaking', 'Elvis', 'felt', 'so', 'unfulfilled', 'so', 'unhappy', 'Elvis', 'had', 'still', 'tremendous', 'impact', 'music', 'pop-culture', 'whole', 'interesting', 'think', 'what', 'Elvis', 'might', 'have', 'achieved', 'had', 'been', 'allowed', 'more', 'importantly', 'had', 'felt', 'secure', 'self-empowered', 'enough', 'chart', 'own', 'personal', 'professional', 'course', 'life']",N/A

The Elvis miniseries is a fantastic effort by (let's not forget) an Irish actor playing an American icon. A daunting task for anyone.Camryn Manheim does a solid job as Mrs. Gladys Presley (although she's a bit weepy and melodramatic at times for belief), but Robert Patrick (of ""The X-Files"" fame) is fantastic as patriarch Vernon Presley. You can feel his embarrassment and shame over not being able to adequately provide for his family in the '50s shots of the Presley family.JRM steals the show and has all of the panache of the young Elvis. I only wish that the producers would've let Rhys Meyers sing more material-he has a great vocal quality. Plus, it looked odd for him to lip-synch with a voice as distinct as Elvis' was and is.My main complaint was the actresses that portrayed Priscilla Beaulieu Presley and Ann-Margaret (Antonia Bernath and Rose McGowan). Bernath just felt WRONG as Priscilla and McGowan was such a ham and overacted the part of Ann-Margaret, that none of the sex kitten so attached to the real Ann-Margaret came through.Overall, a 4-star effort because of the hard-working blue suede shoes of Jonathan Rhys Meyers.

The film is not without its flaws: the script by Patrick Sheane Duncan is painfully pedestrian at times and the use of lip-syncing using a variety of Presley recordings isn't always convincing.  But director James Steven Sadwith manages to overcome the obstacles and gives us a rather personalized view of the life of the King.The film covers Elvis Presley's life from his near poverty beginnings in Tupelo to his worldwide fame and fortune at his 'comeback' in 1968.  The development of the committed guitar-playing singer from his first record through the development of his 'style' and the ultimate glory and insecurity that paired his magic time is well told.  If the story seems to be repetitive and goes on too long, then it also is giving the audience time to see the man behind the shadow of fame.Oddly enough Jonathan Rhys Meyers (now so superb in another biographical series as Henry VIII in 'The Tudors') was imported for the leading role, and while some may question the use of outsourcing here, Rhys Meyers is so convincing in every way that the reasons for casting him are clear. Camryn  Manheim offers fine work as Presley's all-important mother and Robert Patrick plays his supportive father.  Randy Quaid gives a bravura performance as the oddly successful Colonel Parker.  Some of the other roles - Rose McGowan's misfired portrayal of Ann-Margaret and Antonia Bernath's of Priscilla - are less successful, but their contributions are balanced by the fine work of Tom Guinee as the pivotally important Sam Phillips.In all this is a quality piece of work about one of America's icons whose presence is still palpable thirty years after Presley's untimely death at age 42.

The film focuses on his home life and family as his career began and during his rise to superstardom. The relationship between Elvis and his mother is poignant and, at times hilarious (due to Camryn Manheim's extraordinary portrayal of Mama Presley). Also well followed is Elvis's time in the army and the evolution of his relationship to Priscilla. These are aspects of Elvis we don't see or hear about much and make this DVD fascinating and enjoyable. Unfortunately there are some downsides...Randy Quaid plays Colonel Parker, Elvis's manager. Parker is supposed to be foreign and Quaid vacillates between using a thick, almost unintelligible accent and drawling like...well like Randy Quaid. Robert Patrick plays Vernon Presley and also stumbles with his accent. He goes from the clipped elocution of  British royalty to the flats of the American Midwest and only occasionally dips into the correct deep bayou accent (Vernon Presley was from Mississippi). Rose McGowan plays Anne Margaret. Apparently nobody told her or the director that Anne Margaret is Swedish! Ironically, the best and most flawless accent and speech was from Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Elvis (who is the only non-American actor)! Beautifully accurate speech patterns! Mr Meyers resembles Elvis facially and has the requisite hair style/side burns. He is rather too thin and could have used some padding as Elvis aged...but this is not so distracting over all.
