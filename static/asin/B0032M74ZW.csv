The female lead is very pretty but acting is not her strong point.  She did not do a bad job of acting, it just wasn't that great.  The two of them together had absolutely no chemistry.  He was supposed to be a nerd who had known her in college.  She did not pay any attention to him but he was ""in love"" with her.  Years later, he is a software designer and she is a divorced single mother.  They meet again because she works for a company that has another employee who had stolen his software design idea from him.  He wants to reconnect with her and get his software back.  When he goes to her house, she does not remember him and thinks he is the nanny she has just called to watch after her incredibly badly behaved little girl.  First of all, I hate movies in which spoiled, rude, obnoxious, kids are portrayed as cute and the parents smile and scold mildly.  It is so aggravating- probably because I teach and have to put up with that sort of behavior in the classroom.  Anyway, I could see the writing on the wall when I saw how irritating the kid was.  She would be bad for the fifteen other nannies she drove away but this nerdy guy who was not a nanny would turn her around.  The mom drags him in to act as the nanny and he acts like he has no chance to say that he's not the nanny.  How ridiculous- and of course he continues the charade just to be close to the mom who treats him with indifference most of the time.

It has all you expect (and perhaps love) about Bollywood--a simple plot, lots of colorful song and dance, and tame romantic scenes (their lips never touch). What I miss is the over-the-top glam that usually accompanies these tales. Because this one is set in the nerdy world of the software business, they are more limited by their colorless subject matter. Still, you can't go wrong here, and it makes for an enjoyable viewing, especially for westerners who may not be as familiar with Bollywood productions (much of the dialogue is in English).",3,"""Impossible"" is Accessible, Enjoyable, but Forgettable",1336089600,"05 4, 2012",2012,619,"['fun', 'accessible', 'ultimately', 'forgettable', 'Bollywood', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'expect', 'perhaps', 'love', 'Bollywood', 'simple', 'plot', 'lots', 'colorful', 'song', 'dance', 'tame', 'romantic', 'scenes', 'lips', 'never', 'touch', 'What', 'miss', 'over-the-top', 'glam', 'usually', 'tales', 'one', 'set', 'nerdy', 'world', 'software', 'business', 'are', 'more', 'limited', 'colorless', 'subject', 'matter', 'Still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'here', 'enjoyable', 'viewing', 'especially', 'westerners', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'familiar', 'Bollywood', 'productions', 'much', 'dialogue', 'English']",N/A

1319149,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0032M74ZW,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[9, 9]","I've always regarded Uday Chopra as a second hand leading man, but I may have to rethink things because of this movie, and maybe Uday's being so likable in this one is due partly to his having done the writing and producing along with the acting. But there's a lot of wish fulfillment in PYAAR IMPOSSIBLE! - if you ever were a nerd or if you've ever yearned for that special someone who never even glanced at you one time. Slackers like me, we dig movies like this. Even vanity projects like this.Pity the poor unassuming nerd. Uday Chopra plays bespectacled college loser Abhay Sharma and he's deeply smitten with the beautiful Alisha (Priyanka Chopra, no relations, thank god). But the social status quo the way it is, Abhay never stood a chance. Didn't even matter that he saved her life one evening. She just never noticed him. And then she left college.It's seven years later now, and Abhay still pines for Alisha, but he's moved on, sort of. A computer whiz, Abhay has over the past seven years been working on a revolutionary software and he's at last perfected it. But, in the midst of pitching his product to a prospective investor, his software is stolen. A distraught Abhay tracks the thief down to Singapore, where out of the blue, on the street, he sees... well, you can guess...PYAAR IMPOSSIBLE! (""Love Impossible"") is a romantic comedy that shouldn't really work, but does. The story is contrived, the situations are formulaic, I saw every plot twist coming, and it didn't matter. I still liked this movie a lot. With not much being original nowadays, it all falls on execution and the appeal of the actors. And this film benefits from slick direction and a very likable cast. Priyanka Chopra, who was amazing in WHAT'S YOUR RAASHEE?, has become a fine comedienne and she turns in another marvelous performance, seamlessly segueing from college party girl to responsible single working mother. The precocious and very adorable little girl, Advika Yadav, makes her debut and she is a born scene-stealer. And Uday Chopra comes across as so damn nice and sweet. His Abhay Sharma quietly dreams his big romantic dreams, way out of his league, and it's really hard to hate on him. It'd be like kicking a puppy. I wish, though, that Uday had pulled out more from his repertoire of expressions than just that one persistent goofily smiling, half-dazed look.I liked the musical numbers - ""Alisha,"" ""10 on 10,"" ""Pyaar Impossible,"" ""Ek Thi Ladki (bada bada boom),"" and ""You & Me"" - pretty much all the tracks are breezy and hummable. There are some really good laughs in this one, the best being the utterly sidesplitting ""Thai tradition"" scene and those moments when Abhay demonstrates his questionable nanny/housekeeping skills. You've got Abhay assuming a double life and then a triple life, and he's got his work cut out for him as he tries to keep this and that identity secret from various people. There's the corporate theft sub-plot and a dash of caper intrigue as Abhay tries to get back what's his. Mostly, though, it's about the unrequited love story and the comedy. Fine with me. It's nice to find out that, once all is said and done, pyaar is not impossible after all...",4,Thai tradition!,1268870400,"03 18, 2010",2010,3188,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'regarded', 'Uday', 'Chopra', 'second', 'hand', 'leading', 'man', 'may', 'have', 'rethink', 'things', 'movie', 'maybe', 'Uday', 'being', 'so', 'likable', 'one', 'due', 'partly', 'having', 'done', 'writing', 'producing', 'along', 'acting', 'lot', 'wish', 'fulfillment', 'PYAAR', 'IMPOSSIBLE', 'ever', 'were', 'nerd', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'yearned', 'special', 'someone', 'who', 'never', 'even', 'glanced', 'one', 'time', 'Slackers', 'dig', 'movies', 'Even', 'vanity', 'projects', 'this.Pity', 'poor', 'unassuming', 'nerd', 'Uday', 'Chopra', 'plays', 'bespectacled', 'college', 'loser', 'Abhay', 'Sharma', 'deeply', 'smitten', 'beautiful', 'Alisha', 'Priyanka', 'Chopra', 'relations', 'god', 'social', 'status', 'quo', 'way', 'Abhay', 'never', 'stood', 'chance', 'Did', ""n't"", 'even', 'matter', 'saved', 'life', 'one', 'evening', 'just', 'never', 'noticed', 'then', 'left', 'college.It', 'seven', 'years', 'later', 'now', 'Abhay', 'still', 'Alisha', 'moved', 'sort', 'computer', 'whiz', 'Abhay', 'past', 'seven', 'years', 'been', 'working', 'revolutionary', 'software', 'last', 'perfected', 'midst', 'pitching', 'product', 'prospective', 'investor', 'software', 'stolen', 'distraught', 'Abhay', 'thief', 'down', 'Singapore', 'where', 'blue', 'street', 'well', 'can', 'guess', 'PYAAR', 'IMPOSSIBLE', 'Love', 'Impossible', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'should', ""n't"", 'really', 'work', 'story', 'contrived', 'situations', 'are', 'formulaic', 'saw', 'plot', 'twist', 'coming', 'did', ""n't"", 'matter', 'still', 'liked', 'movie', 'lot', 'not', 'much', 'being', 'original', 'nowadays', 'execution', 'appeal', 'actors', 'film', 'benefits', 'slick', 'direction', 'very', 'likable', 'cast', 'Priyanka', 'Chopra', 'who', 'was', 'amazing', 'WHAT', 'YOUR', 'RAASHEE', 'become', 'fine', 'comedienne', 'marvelous', 'performance', 'seamlessly', 'segueing', 'college', 'party', 'girl', 'responsible', 'single', 'working', 'mother', 'precocious', 'very', 'adorable', 'little', 'girl', 'Advika', 'Yadav', 'debut', 'born', 'scene-stealer', 'Uday', 'Chopra', 'across', 'so', 'damn', 'nice', 'sweet', 'Abhay', 'Sharma', 'quietly', 'big', 'romantic', 'dreams', 'way', 'league', 'really', 'hard', 'hate', ""'d"", 'be', 'kicking', 'puppy', 'wish', 'though', 'Uday', 'had', 'pulled', 'out', 'more', 'repertoire', 'expressions', 'just', 'one', 'persistent', 'goofily', 'smiling', 'half-dazed', 'look.I', 'liked', 'musical', 'numbers', 'Alisha', '10', '10', 'Pyaar', 'Impossible', 'Ek', 'Thi', 'Ladki', 'bada', 'boom', 'Me', 'pretty', 'much', 'tracks', 'are', 'breezy', 'hummable', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'laughs', 'one', 'best', 'being', 'utterly', 'sidesplitting', 'Thai', 'tradition', 'scene', 'moments', 'when', 'Abhay', 'questionable', 'nanny/housekeeping', 'skills', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Abhay', 'assuming', 'double', 'life', 'then', 'triple', 'life', 'got', 'work', 'cut', 'out', 'keep', 'identity', 'secret', 'various', 'people', 'corporate', 'theft', 'sub-plot', 'dash', 'caper', 'intrigue', 'Abhay', 'get', 'back', 'what', 'Mostly', 'though', 'unrequited', 'love', 'story', 'comedy', 'Fine', 'nice', 'find', 'out', 'once', 'said', 'done', 'pyaar', 'not', 'impossible']",N/A

You will see where the romance is going from the get-go, but at least the `stolen program' plot thread is a little fresher.Uday Chopra (as Abhay) finally gets a decent role, and he I think he makes a good - if unusual - lead. He wrote this film, too. Priyanka as Alisha is charming as usual, and Advika Yadav as Tania (Alisha's young daughter) is initially infuriating but becomes loveable.The music is so-so.
