It was in the terror of those going through the Earthquake and those watching the Ocean literally rolling over the defenses that proved all too meager as it swept inland, wreaking havoc before it. It was sad watching people standing as the snow came down watching their homes and livelihoods floating away. Disaster is a great leveler, and while I watched, I was seeing history happening. There is something to be learned in every disaster, and it is hoped that those who suffer in any disaster like this will emerge and rebuild for the future. While I add this to my collection, it is for what it depicts as historical content and not for any vicarious pleasure.",5,Truly Monumental......,1389916800,"01 17, 2014",2014,723,"['narration', 'was', 'rather', 'sparse', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'needed', 'was', 'terror', 'going', 'Earthquake', 'watching', 'Ocean', 'literally', 'rolling', 'defenses', 'proved', 'too', 'meager', 'swept', 'inland', 'wreaking', 'havoc', 'was', 'sad', 'watching', 'people', 'standing', 'snow', 'came', 'down', 'watching', 'homes', 'livelihoods', 'floating', 'away', 'Disaster', 'great', 'leveler', 'watched', 'was', 'seeing', 'history', 'happening', 'something', 'be', 'learned', 'disaster', 'hoped', 'who', 'suffer', 'disaster', 'will', 'emerge', 'rebuild', 'future', 'add', 'collection', 'what', 'as', 'historical', 'content', 'not', 'vicarious', 'pleasure']",N/A

This DVD encapsulates a lot of that same footage, edited down into much shorter clips. It's all still very powerful, but the whole program only runs 45 minutes (as it appears to have been made for TV) and feels incomplete as it doesn't include a lot of the powerful footage easily available elsewhere. For example, there is only about 20 seconds shown of that amazing helicopter aerial footage of the giant sludge & debris wave moving so fast across the land, engulfing cars, houses, and everything else in its path. Watching those long unedited clips (sometimes over 10 minutes straight) on youtube as cars keep trying to outrun the debris wave that's coming in all directions was horrifying, but there's none of that on this DVD. Not that I really want to see that horror again, but that footage just really gave you more of an idea how a tsunami engulfs such a large area and moving in each direction all at the same time, so running left or right you just aren't going to escape either way. Before this disaster, no one had any aerial footage of a tsunami, so seeing how practically impossible it is to out-drive or out-run this fast-moving debris sludge-wave was amazing and jaw-dropping - and none of that is here. This DVD focuses more on people on the street footage (from cell-phones, etc.) and that's all fine and great for what it is. The first 15 minutes are devoted to the earthquake itself from various locations in Tokyo and elsewhere. The last 30 minutes focus on the tsunami and the aftermath. There is only a brief mention near the end of the Fukushima plant situation. Don't get me wrong, although short and feeling incomplete, the footage included is still astonishing and of historic relevance, but there really needs to be a much more in-depth and all-encompassing DVD of this horrendous disaster. This feels more like a Cliff's Notes version, but still worthwhile.One other note, the narration is thankfully kept to a minimum and lets most of the footage play out on its own with no voiceovers - that's a HUGE plus. Japanese dialog from people on the scene have easy-to-read subtitles, and a few curse words are bleeped out. There is no cheesy ""muzak"" or sentimental music in the background (as so many of the 9-11 DVD's used), but they do use a low ominous hum throughout, which is effective without being too intrusive. However, that hum gets louder towards the very end of the documentary where it almost drowns out the dialog. I'll never understand these documentarians who think they have to keep adding music and sounds and annoying voiceovers to historic footage instead of just letting it play out raw. This DVD isn't the worst offender by a long shot, though, and I'd recommend it to historians and others still in awe of this horrendous disaster.",3,"Way too brief, but the footage is amazing and heartbreaking.",1333756800,"04 7, 2012",2012,2885,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'footage', 'aired', 'TV', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'clips', 'youtube', 'horrible', 'disaster', 'DVD', 'lot', 'same', 'footage', 'edited', 'down', 'much', 'shorter', 'clips', 'still', 'very', 'powerful', 'whole', 'program', 'only', '45', 'minutes', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'TV', 'feels', 'incomplete', ""n't"", 'include', 'lot', 'powerful', 'footage', 'easily', 'available', 'elsewhere', 'example', 'only', 'about', '20', 'seconds', 'shown', 'amazing', 'helicopter', 'aerial', 'footage', 'giant', 'sludge', 'debris', 'wave', 'moving', 'so', 'fast', 'land', 'engulfing', 'cars', 'houses', 'everything', 'else', 'path', 'Watching', 'long', 'unedited', 'clips', 'sometimes', '10', 'minutes', 'straight', 'youtube', 'cars', 'keep', 'trying', 'outrun', 'debris', 'wave', 'coming', 'directions', 'was', 'horrifying', 'none', 'DVD', 'Not', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'horror', 'again', 'footage', 'just', 'really', 'gave', 'more', 'idea', 'how', 'tsunami', 'engulfs', 'large', 'area', 'moving', 'direction', 'same', 'time', 'so', 'running', 'left', 'right', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'escape', 'way', 'disaster', 'one', 'had', 'aerial', 'footage', 'tsunami', 'so', 'seeing', 'how', 'practically', 'impossible', 'out-drive', 'out-run', 'fast-moving', 'debris', 'sludge-wave', 'was', 'amazing', 'jaw-dropping', 'none', 'here', 'DVD', 'more', 'people', 'street', 'footage', 'cell-phones', 'etc', 'fine', 'great', 'what', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'are', 'devoted', 'earthquake', 'various', 'locations', 'Tokyo', 'elsewhere', 'last', '30', 'minutes', 'focus', 'tsunami', 'aftermath', 'only', 'brief', 'mention', 'end', 'Fukushima', 'plant', 'situation', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'short', 'feeling', 'incomplete', 'footage', 'included', 'still', 'astonishing', 'historic', 'relevance', 'there', 'really', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'in-depth', 'all-encompassing', 'DVD', 'horrendous', 'disaster', 'more', 'Cliff', 'Notes', 'version', 'still', 'other', 'note', 'narration', 'thankfully', 'kept', 'minimum', 'most', 'footage', 'play', 'out', 'own', 'voiceovers', 'HUGE', 'plus', 'Japanese', 'dialog', 'people', 'scene', 'have', 'easy-to-read', 'subtitles', 'few', 'curse', 'words', 'are', 'bleeped', 'out', 'cheesy', 'muzak', 'sentimental', 'music', 'background', 'so', 'many', '9-11', 'DVD', 'used', 'do', 'use', 'low', 'ominous', 'hum', 'effective', 'being', 'too', 'intrusive', 'However', 'hum', 'louder', 'very', 'end', 'documentary', 'where', 'almost', 'out', 'dialog', ""'ll"", 'never', 'understand', 'documentarians', 'who', 'think', 'have', 'keep', 'adding', 'music', 'sounds', 'annoying', 'voiceovers', 'historic', 'footage', 'instead', 'just', 'letting', 'play', 'out', 'raw', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'worst', 'offender', 'long', 'shot', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'historians', 'others', 'still', 'awe', 'horrendous', 'disaster']",N/A

At 45 minutes long, I felt it was too brief and concise. Surely a regular DVD can store at least three hours of footage without much extra expense! Some harrowing parts seen on TV, like the tsunami rushing across the airport all the way to the terminals as the passengers watched from second floors, which was very dramatic, and the sea birds flying inland together with the rusing waves, as if feeding on marine life stirred up from the sea floor, were not included.
