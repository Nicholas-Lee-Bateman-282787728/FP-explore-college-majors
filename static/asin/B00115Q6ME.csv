Like most people, when it comes to pondering death in relation to family, friends, and myself, I go into ocelot mode.What makes this documentary good is that it presents the subject of death and dying with a lot of sensitivity while addressing a lot of the issues associated with grief as well as the funeral and burial process. There are numerous options available to families, but I doubt that many people give this adequate consideration until someone dies. It impressed upon me how important it is to be well-informed and to also make one's wishes known to the family before death visits.The bottom line is this is an interesting and informative look at the funeral industry that approaches the subject of death with a lot of caring while also addressing practical issues. It also doesn't sensationialize death.",5,Something We All Should Consider,1295308800,"01 18, 2011",2011,904,"['originally', 'saw', 'PBS', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'ordered', 'dvd', 'see', 'entire', 'doc', 'most', 'people', 'when', 'pondering', 'death', 'relation', 'family', 'friends', 'go', 'ocelot', 'mode.What', 'documentary', 'good', 'subject', 'death', 'dying', 'lot', 'sensitivity', 'addressing', 'lot', 'issues', 'associated', 'grief', 'as', 'well', 'funeral', 'burial', 'process', 'are', 'numerous', 'options', 'available', 'families', 'doubt', 'many', 'people', 'give', 'adequate', 'consideration', 'someone', 'dies', 'impressed', 'how', 'important', 'be', 'well-informed', 'also', 'make', 'one', 'wishes', 'known', 'family', 'death', 'visits.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'interesting', 'informative', 'look', 'funeral', 'industry', 'subject', 'death', 'lot', 'caring', 'also', 'addressing', 'practical', 'issues', 'also', ""n't"", 'sensationialize', 'death']",Frontline: The Undertaking

We all get deep sixed eventually.Yes, we know and like all those horror flicks about the one-eyed, murderous undertaker in flicks like Fantasm (I know: that particular undertaker happens to be very tall, but does have both eyes) and others. They're fun to watch, no doubt. Thing is, scare flicks are made to entertain you, which is fine...what you get here is the real thing, the way it goes, what actually happens behind the scenes when you kick off.I say take a look; not for any morbid reason, but as a way of dealing with and accepting the whole thing, including the fact you're mortal and everyone's time is fleeting.",4,your date with the reaper treated with dignity,1387929600,"12 25, 2013",2013,762,"['Not', 'something', 'like', 'think', 'good', 'idea', 'dwell', '8211', '8211', 'guess', 'what', 'one', 'get', 'deep', 'sixed', 'eventually.Yes', 'know', 'horror', 'flicks', 'one-eyed', 'murderous', 'undertaker', 'flicks', 'Fantasm', 'know', 'particular', 'undertaker', 'be', 'very', 'tall', 'have', 'eyes', 'others', ""'re"", 'fun', 'watch', 'doubt', 'Thing', 'scare', 'flicks', 'are', 'made', 'entertain', 'fine', 'what', 'get', 'here', 'real', 'thing', 'way', 'what', 'actually', 'scenes', 'when', 'kick', 'off.I', 'say', 'take', 'look', 'not', 'morbid', 'reason', 'way', 'dealing', 'accepting', 'whole', 'thing', 'including', 'fact', ""'re"", 'mortal', 'everyone', 'time', 'fleeting']",Frontline: The Undertaking
