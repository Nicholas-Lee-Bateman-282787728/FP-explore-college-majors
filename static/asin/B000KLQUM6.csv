I was bored out of my mind one afternoon, and I came across a rerun of Girlfriends and I was instantly hooked on this guilty plesure. The four main characters are great, intelligent, witty, sarcastic, and liberating women to say the least. My favorite character is lawyer and marriage-obsessed Joan. I love her three-month rule when it comes to getting down and dirty. If you are hestating, please don't! This show is still going strong in its seventh season even though Toni is no longer around. So save a weekend and indulge in this sinfully delightful show.

From the staunch character played by Ms Tracee Ellis Ross to the modern day free spirit Persia White.  Affluent African Americans portrayed as never before in a natural and real-life setting.  I applaud producer Kelsey Grammer of Cheers, and Frasier fame for a good script, well developed characters and just enough modern day problems and situations to make this show worth taking a look at.  The actresses and actors are well known within the African American community and accomplished in their own right.  Basically you have a sitcom that follows traditional lines but with a hint of Ebonics thrown in to be enjoyable to all.  The women are beautiful and strong American women and the fine portrayal of an affluent African American man by actors such as Reggie Hayes is a welcome treat for viewers like myself who are so tired of seeing African Americans portrayed as pimps and hookers.

Money well spent!  Every episode was very funny start to finish!  Season One is great!  I highly recommend it.The characters ""Maya"", ""Toni"" and ""William"" are the three best characters in the show.  All three are consistently funny.  I love the fact Toni could never remember Jabari's real name.  (""Did Jacuzzi change his name?"" LOL)Now the bad news... based on the merits of Season One, I bought the remaining five seasons.  That was a BIG mistake.  ""Girlfriends"" followed the same path as ""MASH"".... it went from comedy to drama... but in a shorter time span.  Some episodes were so dramatic that they were absolutely painful to watch.  The characters ""Joan"" and ""Lynn"" are both AWFUL.  Joan is so neurotic and unattractive (i.e. Rosanna Rosanadanna hairdo, BIG eyes and nose) it is not funny.  Lynn is an unfunny, selfish, inconsiderate, lazy parasite who avoids work and grown up responsibilities.  ""Girlfriends"" would have been a much better show if Joan and Lynn were written off in the first season and the show remained a comedy.",5,SEASON 1 IS GREAT!,1241827200,"05 9, 2009",2009,1173,"['was', 'curious', 'see', 'show', 'Kelsey', 'Grammar', 'executive', 'producer', 'it.I', 'took', 'chance', 'bought', 'set', 'sight', 'unseen', 'Money', 'well', 'spent', 'Every', 'episode', 'was', 'very', 'funny', 'start', 'finish', 'Season', 'One', 'great', 'highly', 'recommend', 'it.The', 'characters', 'Maya', 'Toni', 'William', 'are', 'three', 'best', 'characters', 'show', 'three', 'are', 'consistently', 'funny', 'love', 'fact', 'Toni', 'could', 'never', 'remember', 'Jabari', 'real', 'name', 'Did', 'Jacuzzi', 'change', 'name', 'LOL', 'Now', 'bad', 'news', 'based', 'merits', 'Season', 'One', 'bought', 'remaining', 'five', 'seasons', 'was', 'BIG', 'mistake', 'Girlfriends', 'followed', 'same', 'path', 'MASH', 'went', 'comedy', 'drama', 'shorter', 'time', 'span', 'episodes', 'were', 'so', 'dramatic', 'were', 'absolutely', 'painful', 'watch', 'characters', 'Joan', 'Lynn', 'are', 'AWFUL', 'Joan', 'so', 'neurotic', 'unattractive', 'i.e', 'Rosanna', 'Rosanadanna', 'hairdo', 'BIG', 'eyes', 'nose', 'not', 'funny', 'Lynn', 'unfunny', 'selfish', 'inconsiderate', 'lazy', 'parasite', 'who', 'work', 'grown', 'up', 'responsibilities', 'Girlfriends', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'show', 'Joan', 'Lynn', 'were', 'written', 'off', 'first', 'season', 'show', 'remained', 'comedy']",Girlfriends - The Complete First Season
1034938,A3R9KRIO25CKZV,B000KLQUM6,"I. Gross Georg ""imgeorg""","[13, 14]","For years now I've been out of touch with the ""Girlfriends"" TV show. For one, they kept moving it from Monday to some other day, then from one time to another, so I'd never know when to set the VCR. Whenever I could finally catch it, I'd never know what was going on, since ""Girlfriends"", like another show I'd like to see, ""Providence"", was serial in nature, in that it had a running story line. I finally gave up trying to watch it on TV, in fact, I've given up watching TV, period. However, I never really gave up wanting to just start over with the show, either through syndication or other means. I'm very happy then, that the DVD of the first season of ""Girlfriends"" is here at last.I've just finished the first season through the four DVDs sent to me by Netflix rental. It left with quite the cliffhanger, giving me the feeling that things aren't going to be quite the same between the four women from here out. The writing for this show is great. It's about the lives of four black women of varying socioeconomic and marital status who have managed to forge a great relationship with each other: Attorney Joan, her best friend from childhood, Toni; their friend from college, Lynn; Joan's secretary Maya, and Joan's colleague William is there to offer the male perspective.Tracee Ellis Ross, as Joan, is a fantastic comic actress; I love those segments where she thinks out loud to the audience! That she's the daughter of a show business legend makes for a good Jeopardy question, however the younger Ms. Ross has carved out a niche of her own as one of the new queens of comedy! And don't we all know people like Joan, the peacemaker who's always trying to fix someone's problems, with the best of intentions. Golden Brooks, as Maya, is a beautiful actress who gives her character a spiritual groundedness as the thus-far only married character. Maya may be lower on the totem pole socially than her boss and Toni, but she brings to the table a pride and intelligence that's not often considered from a secretary, and I like that about this character. On the other hand, Jill Marie Jones' Toni Childs brings all sorts of issues to the table, from skin color to the fact that the way to her heart is through her wallet; and haven't we all known, either personally or otherwise, someone whose sheer gall gets them into trouble and whom we feel obligated to rescue because we've know them so long? Persia White plays the striking young drifter who can't seem to reconcile with life outside of college. Lynn seems to be the flower child who is a couple of decades too late.I wish I had a posse like this...without the drama, of course! Seriously, the writers have created four very believable women and put them in very believable situations, some of which are very serious, and still there's room for humor. I don't think there's another show like it, and it doesn't hurt that the executive producer of the show is Frasier's Kelsey Grammar.""Girlfriends"" is the best thing to happen to network television, and I hope this is the first of all seven seasons to be released to disc. It will be interesting to see how the show and the characters evolve from here. One thing I would like to see on future sets, is some commentary, either from the main actors or the guest artists or the director of each show. Don't just put the shows on and that's that; this is the only thing that was disappointing There should be extras for a show like this. Surely there were outtakes and other things that didn't make it to broadcast. I would have liked to have seen something on how ""Girlfriends"" came into being in the first place. This would have been good for a first DVD, but since we didn't get that I'm hoping subsequent releases will be more interesting.",4,Amazing Writing for this Classy Posse,1177200000,"04 22, 2007",2007,3752,"['years', 'now', ""'ve"", 'been', 'touch', 'Girlfriends', 'TV', 'show', 'one', 'kept', 'moving', 'Monday', 'other', 'day', 'then', 'one', 'time', ""'d"", 'never', 'know', 'when', 'set', 'VCR', 'Whenever', 'could', 'finally', 'catch', ""'d"", 'never', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'Girlfriends', 'show', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'Providence', 'was', 'serial', 'nature', 'had', 'running', 'story', 'line', 'finally', 'gave', 'up', 'trying', 'watch', 'TV', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'given', 'up', 'watching', 'TV', 'period', 'However', 'never', 'really', 'gave', 'up', 'wanting', 'just', 'start', 'show', 'syndication', 'other', 'means', ""'m"", 'very', 'happy', 'then', 'DVD', 'first', 'season', 'Girlfriends', 'here', 'last.I', ""'ve"", 'just', 'finished', 'first', 'season', 'four', 'DVDs', 'sent', 'Netflix', 'rental', 'left', 'cliffhanger', 'giving', 'feeling', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'quite', 'same', 'four', 'women', 'here', 'out', 'writing', 'show', 'great', 'lives', 'four', 'black', 'women', 'varying', 'socioeconomic', 'marital', 'status', 'who', 'have', 'managed', 'forge', 'great', 'relationship', 'other', 'Attorney', 'Joan', 'best', 'friend', 'childhood', 'Toni', 'friend', 'college', 'Lynn', 'Joan', 'secretary', 'Maya', 'Joan', 'colleague', 'William', 'there', 'offer', 'male', 'perspective.Tracee', 'Ellis', 'Ross', 'Joan', 'fantastic', 'comic', 'actress', 'love', 'segments', 'where', 'out', 'loud', 'audience', 'daughter', 'show', 'business', 'legend', 'good', 'Jeopardy', 'question', 'however', 'younger', 'Ms.', 'Ross', 'carved', 'out', 'niche', 'own', 'one', 'new', 'queens', 'comedy', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'people', 'Joan', 'peacemaker', 'who', 'always', 'trying', 'fix', 'someone', 'problems', 'best', 'intentions', 'Golden', 'Brooks', 'Maya', 'beautiful', 'actress', 'who', 'character', 'spiritual', 'groundedness', 'thus-far', 'only', 'married', 'character', 'Maya', 'may', 'be', 'lower', 'totem', 'socially', 'boss', 'Toni', 'table', 'pride', 'intelligence', 'not', 'often', 'considered', 'secretary', 'like', 'character', 'other', 'hand', 'Jill', 'Marie', 'Jones', 'Toni', 'Childs', 'sorts', 'issues', 'table', 'skin', 'color', 'fact', 'way', 'heart', 'wallet', 'have', ""n't"", 'known', 'personally', 'otherwise', 'someone', 'sheer', 'gall', 'trouble', 'whom', 'feel', 'obligated', 'rescue', ""'ve"", 'know', 'so', 'long', 'Persia', 'White', 'striking', 'young', 'drifter', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'reconcile', 'life', 'college', 'Lynn', 'be', 'flower', 'child', 'who', 'couple', 'decades', 'too', 'late.I', 'wish', 'had', 'posse', 'drama', 'course', 'Seriously', 'writers', 'have', 'created', 'four', 'very', 'believable', 'women', 'put', 'very', 'believable', 'situations', 'are', 'very', 'serious', 'still', 'room', 'humor', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'show', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'executive', 'producer', 'show', 'Frasier', 'Kelsey', 'Grammar', 'Girlfriends', 'best', 'thing', 'happen', 'network', 'television', 'hope', 'first', 'seven', 'seasons', 'be', 'released', 'disc', 'will', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'show', 'characters', 'evolve', 'here', 'One', 'thing', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'future', 'sets', 'commentary', 'either', 'main', 'actors', 'guest', 'artists', 'director', 'show', 'Do', ""n't"", 'just', 'put', 'shows', 'only', 'thing', 'was', 'disappointing', 'should', 'be', 'extras', 'show', 'Surely', 'were', 'outtakes', 'other', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'broadcast', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'something', 'how', 'came', 'being', 'first', 'place', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'first', 'DVD', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'subsequent', 'releases', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'interesting']",Girlfriends - The Complete First Season

I was pleasantly surprised that I liked the show.  The writing is really good, but what sold me on the show was TONI.  TONI is self absorbed but she is clearly the personality of the show.This season, I did not like Joan talking in that bubble; Joan's over the top personality and the bad weaves.  Maya and Toni's weaves were horrible.  Also, in the opening scenes they are wearing these outdated red, white and blue jean outfits.  Maya actually has on some red leather pants.  I am glad they finally got rid of those outfits after season 2.Personally, I think Lynne should have not been included on the show or written better.  In this season, she really has no purpose and they claim Joan has been supporting her for 8 years.  Joan is about 27-29 and has been in school for most of those years.  It is not believeable that she supported Lynne for the last eight years.Maya is ghetto, but believeable.
