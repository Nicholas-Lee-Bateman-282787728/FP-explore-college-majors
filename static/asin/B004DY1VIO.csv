1397531,A17WGEUH86HDSK,B004DY1VIO,Daniel Roman,"[5, 5]","This film is not difficult to review, nor is the story complicated to express an opinion for the message remains clear and certainly not without its overall importance well beyond entertainment.  ""Sands of Iwo Jima"" became a view of history from the commentary of several who remember those early days of 1945.  Every day we lose another survivor of that battle and a film of this importance can act only as a reminder that the footprints of those who served, died or survived assured us all that we are a part of this world due to their relentless service not only to a country but to a world.Iwo Jima took the lives of many men on both sides of the conflict in the Pacific.  A few names immediately come to mind beyond the many whose lives were either ended or forever changed during this horrific battle.  Sgt. Mike Strank (whom they called ""Pappy"" because he was the oldest, born in Jarbino, Czechoslovakia November 10th (curiously the anniversary of the founding of the Marine Corps( 1919, and died on March 1st 1945 never realizing the impact of the flag raising had on the balance of the war and the millions at home.  Marine private Franklin Sousley, Cpl. Harlon Block, made up three of the six who raised the U.S. flag atop Mt. Suribachi, and three of the six who died on that rock pile in the Ryuku Island chain.  The survivors, Navy Corpsman (recipient of the Navy Cross)John Bradley, Rene Gagnon, PFC Ira Hayes, all now a part of history, told many times the story of the flag raising but what was always more important was the reminder of that day and the men who fought and died there.  The film, ""Sands of Iwo Jima"" had little to do with the actual battle, but it tells a tale of a platoon of 1940's Marines, a tale so personal and enlightening that it presented the Marine Corps as it was - the cast and swagger of John Wayne, the presence of Forrest Tucker, the laughter and light-heartedness of Wally Cassell became the presence of a cross section of American youth offering all they had including their lives was the true representation of this remarkable film.  We are proud of our Warriors of Today, and because of films such as ""Sands of Iwo Jima""  and its remarkable history, remind us that these too, were the Warriors that made our lives possible.
