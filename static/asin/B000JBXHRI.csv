1025893,A1X8X47IEVEAZD,B000JBXHRI,"F. F. Dumlao ""violencejack""","[0, 0]",One of the most memorable fantastic series around.  It doesn't rely on special effects but rather really good writing.  The character of The Doctor is consistent with his predecessors and the actors bring their own unique spin on it.  Christopher Eccleston and David Tennant bring The Doctor to life and give him such presence. The interaction between The Doctor and all the recurring characters is tight and makes the series believable.Good writing and solid acting make this series awesome.,5,Fantastic Series!,1260921600,"12 16, 2009",2009,492,"['One', 'most', 'memorable', 'fantastic', 'series', ""n't"", 'rely', 'special', 'effects', 'rather', 'really', 'good', 'writing', 'character', 'Doctor', 'consistent', 'predecessors', 'actors', 'bring', 'own', 'unique', 'spin', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'David', 'Tennant', 'bring', 'Doctor', 'life', 'give', 'such', 'presence', 'interaction', 'Doctor', 'recurring', 'characters', 'tight', 'series', 'believable.Good', 'writing', 'solid', 'acting', 'make', 'series', 'awesome']",Doctor Who: The Complete Series 1-2

1025896,AX0KJ7MZDKLBM,B000JBXHRI,Joseph Rochetto,"[1, 1]","With all the deserved hoopla over David Tennant as the 10th Doctor, people forget that when Dr. Who reemerged with Chris Eccleston as the 9th Doctor there was an equal amount of hoopla.  Now he's overlooked.  So buying these two years together, year one with Eccleston and year two with Tennant, bound together with Rose as the companion offer a good comparison.  I never want to forget Eccleston's perormance.  Had he continued, the series would have been every bit as good, albeit in a different direction.  He is the least quirky, or most ""normal"" of all the Doctors I am familiar with and that leant a level of believability to the character.  He's almost the ""superhero space alien next door"".  Kind, caring, and an ironic sense of humor, somewhat distant and mysterious with none of Tennant's manic qualities",5,Great comparison of the two Doctors,1268438400,"03 13, 2010",2010,814,"['deserved', 'hoopla', 'David', 'Tennant', '10th', 'Doctor', 'people', 'forget', 'when', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'reemerged', 'Chris', 'Eccleston', '9th', 'Doctor', 'was', 'equal', 'amount', 'hoopla', 'Now', 'overlooked', 'So', 'buying', 'two', 'years', 'together', 'year', 'one', 'Eccleston', 'year', 'two', 'Tennant', 'together', 'Rose', 'companion', 'offer', 'good', 'comparison', 'never', 'want', 'forget', 'Eccleston', 'perormance', 'Had', 'continued', 'series', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'good', 'albeit', 'different', 'direction', 'least', 'quirky', 'most', 'normal', 'Doctors', 'am', 'familiar', 'leant', 'level', 'believability', 'character', 'almost', 'superhero', 'space', 'alien', 'next', 'door', 'Kind', 'caring', 'ironic', 'sense', 'humor', 'somewhat', 'distant', 'mysterious', 'none', 'Tennant', 'manic', 'qualities']",Doctor Who: The Complete Series 1-2

Sparkling dialouge, great character development. The Characters are believable; the situations they are thrust into are exotic and complex, but more importantly, work to bring out the best or the worst of their personalities.
