So from the day my grandparents finally bought a TV when I was almost five until the time I was ten, I saw the show which was, I see now, only very loosely based on this movie, and the stage play before it. About the only thing that's the same is the names of the characters and the location: San Francisco.Katrin (Barbara Bel Geddes) wants to be a writer someday, and she's the one that's writing this story. Her mother is Marta (Irene Dunne), who was born in Norway. She and her young husband came to San Francisco because all her sisters lived there, and ""it's good for families to be together."" Papa is a carpenter, a union man we eventually discover, and not very much a part of the story except to be the strong, silent one smoking his pipe and being somewhat indulgent to his children. The oldest is Nils, the only boy. Then there's Katrin, Christine, and Dagmar.It may seem like a pretty conventional family story, with those who get along and those that don't. Those that are loud and bossy, and those that are quiet and sometimes walked on. Three aunts, one very boisterous uncle, and then there's the undertaker that wants to marry one of the aunts, and there's ""that woman."" I won't spoil it, but basically she is loud Uncle Peter's ""housekeeper,"" the one the aunts all gossip about.Mama is quiet and sensible, but she is a lioness about her children. When Dagmar is taken to the hospital for emergency surgery, she is told that the hospital has a rule of no visitors for the first 24 hours. She protests that she promised Dagmar she would be there for her, and she's worried the child will be frightened. Naturally, she finds a way to get in to see Dagmar anyway.It's not a comedy story, but there is considerable humor in it. When Dagmar names the stray cat she took in Elizabeth, Nils tells her she'd better choose a different name because Elizabeth is a tom. She resists, so Papa suggests she call him Uncle Elizabeth, and Uncle Elizabeth he becomes. Then when Uncle Elizabeth is in a terrible fight and is suffering from his wounds, Mama and Papa decide the only decent thing to do is chloroform him.

Irene Dunne was one of my favorite actors; my mother appreciated her, too.My daughter wants my 12-year-old granddaughter to view this video, as well, because she would enjoy the humor and the way the family bond together, getting through circumstances with love and great strength.

417454,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,6304383169,Byron Kolln,"[1, 1]","""For long as I could remember, the house on the Larkin Street Hill had been home. Papa and Mama had both been born in Norway but they came to San Francisco because Mama's sisters were here, all of us were born here. Nels, the oldest and the only boy, my sister Christine and the littlest sister Dagmar; but first and foremost, I remember Mama"".So begins the heartwarming family drama of I REMEMBER MAMA (1948), based on John Van Druten's successful Broadway play, and the semi-autobiographical novel ""Mama's Bank Account"" by Kathryn Forbes.  Director George Stevens chose this as his first film project after returning from his duties in the Army Signal Corps in WW2, and it struck a nostalgic chord for the emotionally-matured director.  Part of his assignment was to film the liberation of the Dachau concentration camp and the landings at Normandy.  Those experiences stayed with the filmmaker and gave his later titles (chiefly ""Shane"", ""A Place in the Sun"" and ""The Diary of Anne Frank"") a darker edge that hadn't really been apparent in his earlier, pre-war movies.  I REMEMBER MAMA clearly struck a few chords for Stevens, and it's turn-of-the-century San Francisco setting and homespun values also resonated with audiences, who recognized those as things we were fighting for during the war.I REMEMBER MAMA is really a collection of memories as opposed to a complete through-storyline, related to us by the eldest daughter Katrin (played by a young, fresh-faced Barbara Bel Geddes).  Mama (Irene Dunne) is the hard-working, loving yet stoic glue who holds the Hanson family together.  When Aunt Trina (Ellen Corby) wants to get married, first she appeals to Mama in gently breaking the news to their busybody sisters Jenny and Sigrid.  Then there's the time where Mama had to masquerade as a washer-woman in order to see little Dagmar (June Hedin) in the hospital; and all the trouble with Dagmar's cat Uncle Elizabeth on the day she was to return home.Katrin herself wants to be a writer, but every time she puts pen to paper and invents her own fairytale characters it always turns into a disaster.  It's only after Mama ""arranges"" a meeting with famous author Florence Dana Moorhead (Florence Bates) that she finally discovers the key: to write about things and people you already know.  ""Write about Papa"", Mama instructs Katrin.  Little does Mama know how much she herself will figure in Katrin's stories...and in our hearts.All the performances are sublime.  I REMEMBER MAMA boasted no less than four Academy Award-nominated performances (Irene Dunne as Mama, Barbara Bel Geddes as Katrin, Oscar Homolka as Uncle Chris, and Ellen Corby as Aunt Trina).  It's a movie filled with humour, hope and yes, heartbreak as well.  I guarantee you'll want to revisit Mama and the house on Larkin Street again and again!The only downside to the current DVD from Warners is the badly-damaged print it contains.  Full of scratches, nicks and reel-cues, it clearly wasn't digitally prepared before being mastered for DVD.  That's a real shame but it doesn't entirely lessen the thrill of having this landmark title in my classic movie collection.

It's 1910 in San Francisco, and Mama (Irene Dunne) and her husband (Philip Dorn), a carpenter, have lived in America for some 15 years, raising four American children--Nels (Steve Brown), 14, whose current greatest ambition is to go on to high school; Katrin (Barbara Bel Geddes), 12, who dreams of being a writer; Christine (Peggy McIntyre), 10; and little Dagmar (June Hedin), the animal-lover, who eventually declares her wish to become a veterinarian, and meanwhile takes in a tomcat she names Uncle Elizabeth, a dog who presents her with puppies, and a litter of five white bunnies.  Their extended family includes Mama's sisters, overbearing Aunt Jenny (Hope Landin), whiney Aunt Sigrid (Edith Evanson) and her lame son Cousin Arne (Tommy Ivo), shy spinster Aunt Trina (Ellen Corby), and their Uncle Chris (Oscar Homolka), a gruff ""black Norwegian"" who for many years has openly lived with his housekeeper (Barbara O'Neil) on his ranch north of the city.

417470,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6304383169,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 1]","There are two key reasons to watch this sentimental yet emotionally involving 1948 immigrant family saga today. The first is George Stevens' assured direction, his first post-WWII film and a palpable sign of his wartime experiences that portends his deepening sense of character in dramas likeA Place in the SunandShaneafter his years of breezy comedies and musicals. The second is star Irene Dunne, who caps her impressively versatile screen career with a performance of unforced warmth and uncommon depth. With no make-up and sporting a convincing Norwegian accent, she provides the film's heart and emotional anchor as Mama.The framing device for the story is the recently completed manuscript by Katrin Hanson which she reads out loud while reminiscing about her Norwegian family in San Francisco circa 1910. A family of six living on hilly Larkin Street, the Hansons maintain their core family unit despite a lot of hardships and eccentric relatives. While father Lars toils as a carpenter to support his family, Katrin's memories inevitably revolve around her stoic mother Martha, who consistently shows the courage of her convictions. When spinsterish Aunt Trina decides to marry a milquetoast pharmacist, it is Martha who must get consensus from her intolerant sisters Jenny and Sigrid as well as Uncle Chris, a black-sheep blowhard who acts as the family patriarch. When Katrin's baby sister Dagmar goes to the hospital overnight, it is Martha who disguises herself as a charwoman to be able to stay with her. And when Katrin becomes discouraged enough to give up her writing aspirations, it is again Martha who finagles her way to meeting a famous author and convincing her to read one of Katrin's short stories.Beyond Dunne's exemplary work, there is a sturdy supporting cast to consider - Oscar Homolka bringing the requisite bluster to Uncle Chris, Ellen Corby in her only first-rate screen role as timid Aunt Trina, and at 25, Barbara Bel Geddes conveying convincing adolescent innocence as Katrin. DeWitt Bodeen's screenplay captures the episodic nature of the real Katrin Forbes' remembrance and one can assume of John Van Druten's Broadway play. It should be noted that without Stevens and Dunne, the film would surely feel far more interminable at its 134-minute running length.

417500,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,6304383169,Martin Asiner,"[17, 17]","Few films can tug at the heart strings as well as I REMEMBER MAMA. Adapted from the John Van Druten play, which was itself taken from the Kathryn Forbes novel, I REMEMBER MAMA captures indelibly slices of time in the life of a Norwegian family living in San Francisco at the turn of the 19th century. Narrated by a grown up Katrin (Barbara Bel Geddes), the film combines the problems of adapting to life in the United States with solutions that seem unworkable to those still steeped in the ways of the Old Country. At the center is Mama(Irene Dunne), who orchestrates the lives of her large extended family. Irene Dunne is superb with her profound understanding of human nature. She shows in scene after scene that a matriarch must be flexible enough to account for and guide the divergent personalities of her family. For her sisters, Mama makes it clear that she will not permit them to bully her vulnerable children. For her children, she extends praise when it is needed and stoicism when that is needed too. And for the boarder who skips town without paying his owed rent, she resigns herself that he has paid in a different coin, that of reading the classics to her children, thus inculcating in them a love of words. Surrounding Irene Dunne is a group of superb supporting actors, all of whom add flavor to a film that is linked only by the memories of Katrin. Perhaps the most outstanding job is the one done by the non-paying boarder, Mr.Hyde (Cedric Hardwicke), who nightly regales the family with timeless tales narrated in his booming voice, the sum total of which is to create a story within a story with each passing tale. Although the years pass, no one seems to age, and that is all right since the segue from scene to scene is accomplished so seamlessly that the audience scarcely notices. Oscar Homolka as Uncle Chris hits just the right note as the blustery yet kindly man who hides his kindness beneath a pushy attitude. Interspersed through key scenes in the movie are the appearances of Katrin, who interrupts the narrative to talk directly to the audience, commenting like a subdued omniscient narrator on the plot. Again, rather than putting off the audience with a style of narration that in another film would surely be seen as intrusive, in I REMEMBER MAMA, Katrin's comments, as well as all the various strands of the film, are seen instead as welcome threads that unite what could have been an aimless, disjointed movie into a chronicle of a family that rings true with each passing scene. Not many movies can come close to accomplishing this. Homolka, Bel Gedddes, and Dunne were all nominated for Academy Awards. This is truly one of the most heart-warming films of all time.",5,Mama as Memory,1029283200,"08 14, 2002",2002,2707,"['Few', 'films', 'can', 'tug', 'heart', 'as', 'well', 'REMEMBER', 'MAMA', 'Adapted', 'John', 'Van', 'Druten', 'play', 'was', 'taken', 'Kathryn', 'Forbes', 'novel', 'REMEMBER', 'MAMA', 'captures', 'indelibly', 'slices', 'time', 'life', 'Norwegian', 'family', 'living', 'San', 'Francisco', 'turn', '19th', 'century', 'Narrated', 'grown', 'up', 'Katrin', 'Barbara', 'Bel', 'Geddes', 'film', 'problems', 'adapting', 'life', 'United', 'States', 'solutions', 'seem', 'unworkable', 'still', 'steeped', 'ways', 'Old', 'Country', 'center', 'Mama', 'Irene', 'Dunne', 'who', 'lives', 'large', 'extended', 'family', 'Irene', 'Dunne', 'superb', 'profound', 'understanding', 'human', 'nature', 'scene', 'scene', 'matriarch', 'must', 'be', 'flexible', 'enough', 'account', 'guide', 'divergent', 'personalities', 'family', 'sisters', 'Mama', 'clear', 'will', 'not', 'permit', 'bully', 'vulnerable', 'children', 'children', 'praise', 'when', 'needed', 'stoicism', 'when', 'needed', 'too', 'boarder', 'who', 'town', 'paying', 'owed', 'rent', 'paid', 'different', 'coin', 'reading', 'classics', 'children', 'thus', 'inculcating', 'love', 'words', 'Surrounding', 'Irene', 'Dunne', 'group', 'superb', 'supporting', 'actors', 'whom', 'add', 'flavor', 'film', 'linked', 'only', 'memories', 'Katrin', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'outstanding', 'job', 'one', 'done', 'non-paying', 'boarder', 'Mr.Hyde', 'Cedric', 'Hardwicke', 'who', 'nightly', 'family', 'timeless', 'tales', 'narrated', 'booming', 'voice', 'sum', 'total', 'create', 'story', 'story', 'passing', 'tale', 'years', 'pass', 'one', 'age', 'right', 'segue', 'scene', 'scene', 'accomplished', 'so', 'seamlessly', 'audience', 'scarcely', 'notices', 'Oscar', 'Homolka', 'Uncle', 'Chris', 'just', 'right', 'note', 'blustery', 'yet', 'kindly', 'man', 'who', 'kindness', 'pushy', 'attitude', 'Interspersed', 'key', 'scenes', 'movie', 'are', 'appearances', 'Katrin', 'who', 'narrative', 'talk', 'directly', 'audience', 'commenting', 'subdued', 'omniscient', 'narrator', 'plot', 'Again', 'rather', 'putting', 'off', 'audience', 'style', 'narration', 'film', 'would', 'surely', 'be', 'seen', 'intrusive', 'REMEMBER', 'MAMA', 'Katrin', 'comments', 'as', 'well', 'various', 'strands', 'film', 'are', 'seen', 'instead', 'welcome', 'threads', 'unite', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'aimless', 'disjointed', 'movie', 'chronicle', 'family', 'true', 'passing', 'scene', 'Not', 'many', 'movies', 'can', 'come', 'close', 'accomplishing', 'Homolka', 'Bel', 'Gedddes', 'Dunne', 'were', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'truly', 'one', 'most', 'heart-warming', 'films', 'time']",I Remember Mama VHS

417503,A1FG91CM8221X1,6304383169,Miles D. Moore,"[3, 3]","George Stevens' ""I Remember Mama"" is a two-hour vacation in a sweeter, gentler world--in this case, San Francisco circa 1910. The wonderful Irene Dunne has one of her best roles as Marta Hansen, matriarch of a large, loving Norwegian-American family. The family's various adventures introduce us to literary daughter Katrin (Barbara Bel Geddes); shy, fluttery Aunt Trina (Ellen Corby); blustery, hard-drinking Uncle Chris (Oscar Homolka); and a whole gallery of prickly but lovable eccentrics. After a steady diet this fall of superbly made but bleak crime dramas, I was delighted to turn to ""I Remember Mama,"" which concerns no more and no less than a family whose members love each other, and whose lives have meaning and purpose. Stevens and screenwriter DeWitt Bodeen (working from John Van Druten's play) provide abundant warmth, charm, and poignancy while using a blessedly light hand with the saccharine. Modern viewers inevitably will be reminded of ""The Waltons,"" both because of the aspiring writer in the family and the presence of Ellen Corby. ""I Remember Mama,"" however, avoids the ickiness that enveloped ""The Waltons"" in its later seasons as the writers ran out of both ideas and original cast members. (Trivia question: name the famous film, also set in San Francisco, made ten years after ""I Remember Mama"" and featuring both Barbara Bel Geddes and Ellen Corby.)

417504,A3EBVMK5WW28SJ,6304383169,Miss Yoka,"[14, 15]","I was very disappointed with both the visual and audio quality of this DVD. It was startling to see the difference between the intro by Stevens's son and the main film. It appears that no effort was made to find a good quality print, let alone do a restoration. The extras are pitiful and would lead one to think that Irene Dunne had no long history of film roles behind her (which she had) or that Barbara Bel Geddes had no future after this film (which she  did). And what of the stage play? Did I see a glimpse of Marlon Brando in that hastily shown photo (this play was his stage debut). And what of Oscar Homolka's role in the play and the film? He was brilliant. Rudy Vallee was also a standout and an oveview of his film career would have been a worthwhile addition. It's a shame that the people who issue these oldie goldies aren't aware that a lot of us weren't even born until many, many decades later and that we want/need all that ""filler' information. A history of the play, a history of the players, as well as a bit of social commentary on the times depicted would greatly aid in the appreciation of this film. Without proper context it seemed syrupy and manipulative.

I found it thoroughly delightful with just the right amount of sentimentality, not overly mushy.  Being a book lover and especially of English literature, I particularly enjoyed the references to some of my favorite books.  While the film obviously centers around the mother (played wonderfully by Irene Dunn in a role like no other I've ever seen her in) I think tribute should also be made to the somewhat silent yet strong role the father played.  I particularly liked the way he offered coffee to the daughter when she so obviously had ""grown up"" (as well as the look on his face when the mother doused with cream) and the ""smoking"" lesson he taught his son.

Set at the turn of the last century in San Francisco, the film stars the usually scatterbrained Irene Dunne; on this occasion as the tender yet determined matriarch, Martha Hanson.  Together with her husband, Lars (Philip Dorn) and extended family (buttressed by a stellar cast including Barbara Bel Geddes, Cedric Hardwicke, Ellen Corby, Rudy Vallee, Edgar Bergan and Florence Bates) the Norwegian clan weathers some hard knocks and poignant moments with grace and charm. This is one of those elegant little `jabs of pleasure' that American cinema used to dole out en masse during its golden age, but now seems rendered in exceedingly short supply. Based on John Van Druten's hit play (derived from Kathryn Forbes's autobiographical memoir), the film is a veritable feast for the heart and mind; a richly textured and moving experience - not to be missed.Unfortunately more could have been done to clean up this print before rushing it out to DVD. Warner's transfer is marred by a considerable amount of age related artifacts. Though the gray scale is nicely balanced at times, the image often tends to exhibit an overly soft quality that is more blurry than evocative of mood or style. There is also a considerable amount of film grain present in most scenes. Otherwise, black and contrast levels on the whole tend to be deep and nicely balanced. There are no digital anomalies. The audio is mono and suffers at times from a muffled characteristic. Background hiss is detected in quiescent scenes. A brief introduction by the director's son, George Steven's Jr. is all the extras you get. Bottom line; this film still gets my recommendation for a must have Christmas stocking stuffer.

417510,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,6304383169,Randy Keehn,"[10, 10]","A few years ago, a competent local acting group put on the play ""I Remember Mama"".  I went to the play, was impressed with the quality of our local actors and actresses, and wondered why anyone would have wanted to see such a dumb collection of trivial incidents.  I remembered that Irene Dunne was a nominee for Best Actress for her role as Mama but the play left me wondering if Martha Raye (or Phyllis Diller in a later production) might not have been the better choice.  The events were so commonplace, I assumed that they were supposed to be funny (and the humor wasn't working well).  Fortunately, after taping it 6 months ago, I finally decided to check the movie.  There had to be SOME reason it was considered such a good movie.I found the answer to my question when I realized that the power in ""I Remember Mama"" was in the outstanding performances.  There were actually 4 persons nominated for Oscars for their roles in ""I Remember Mama"".  I think the only other nomination was for Cinematography or something like that.  Giving credit also to Director George Stevens for bringing all this together, I was impressed by how such day to day things could be elevated to such powerful images.  Just about all families deal with the loss of a pet, the hospitalization of a child, a zany and/or eccentric relative that comes to visit, budgeting the household funds to make do and have the occassional surprize, sacrificing something of value to give something of greater value, etc, etc, etc.  Being able to sense the humanity in all of the characters was quite an accomplishment for the whole production.  I found myself misty-eyed over the same mundane sketches that made me look at my watch during the play.  The discrepancy was not a comment on our local thespians.  Rather, it was a testament to a director's vision of how to use everyday family life as a means to look at family life itself.  The close-up look at each individual character in the midst of group settings made ""I Remember Mama"" a film that I will remember as well.",5,The Movie is Better than the Play,1148169600,"05 21, 2006",2006,2041,"['few', 'years', 'ago', 'competent', 'local', 'acting', 'group', 'put', 'play', 'Remember', 'Mama', 'went', 'play', 'was', 'impressed', 'quality', 'local', 'actors', 'actresses', 'wondered', 'why', 'anyone', 'would', 'have', 'wanted', 'see', 'such', 'dumb', 'collection', 'trivial', 'incidents', 'remembered', 'Irene', 'Dunne', 'was', 'nominee', 'Best', 'Actress', 'role', 'Mama', 'play', 'left', 'wondering', 'Martha', 'Raye', 'Phyllis', 'Diller', 'later', 'production', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'choice', 'events', 'were', 'so', 'commonplace', 'assumed', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'humor', 'was', ""n't"", 'working', 'well', 'Fortunately', 'taping', '6', 'months', 'ago', 'finally', 'decided', 'check', 'movie', 'had', 'be', 'SOME', 'reason', 'was', 'considered', 'good', 'movie.I', 'found', 'answer', 'question', 'when', 'realized', 'power', 'Remember', 'Mama', 'was', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'were', 'actually', '4', 'persons', 'nominated', 'Oscars', 'roles', 'Remember', 'Mama', 'think', 'only', 'other', 'nomination', 'was', 'Cinematography', 'something', 'Giving', 'credit', 'also', 'Director', 'George', 'Stevens', 'bringing', 'together', 'was', 'impressed', 'how', 'such', 'day', 'day', 'things', 'could', 'be', 'elevated', 'such', 'powerful', 'images', 'Just', 'families', 'deal', 'loss', 'pet', 'hospitalization', 'child', 'zany', 'and/or', 'eccentric', 'relative', 'visit', 'budgeting', 'household', 'funds', 'make', 'do', 'have', 'occassional', 'surprize', 'sacrificing', 'something', 'value', 'give', 'something', 'greater', 'value', 'etc', 'etc', 'etc', 'Being', 'able', 'sense', 'humanity', 'characters', 'was', 'quite', 'accomplishment', 'whole', 'production', 'found', 'misty-eyed', 'same', 'mundane', 'sketches', 'made', 'look', 'watch', 'play', 'discrepancy', 'was', 'not', 'comment', 'local', 'thespians', 'Rather', 'was', 'testament', 'director', 'vision', 'how', 'use', 'everyday', 'family', 'life', 'look', 'family', 'life', 'close-up', 'look', 'individual', 'character', 'midst', 'group', 'settings', 'made', 'Remember', 'Mama', 'film', 'will', 'remember', 'as', 'well']",I Remember Mama VHS

417519,A14OB7YKMPBJLW,6304383169,Susan Fong,"[98, 99]","""I Remember Mama"" presents a gentle and compassionate portrait of a family of Norwegian immigrants who settle in San Francisco in the early 1900's.  The movie is narrated by the family's eldest daughter, now an adult, who has written a memoir about her childhood and her colorful family.  Her family includes Mama, Papa, siblings, and some overbearing but well-intentioned aunts and uncle.Nothing sensational or terribly exciting happens in the lives of these ordinary, working class immigrants.  Yet, there is extraordinary poignance in the way in which the family deals with everyday crises such as the fate of an injured pet cat or the dilemma of a mother who is not allowed to see her child in the hospital.Acclaimed director George Stevens reconstructs such events with an honesty and delicacy that resonates long after the movie ends.  And Stevens elicits superb performances from his cast led by Irene Dunne as the title character ""Mama"".  Dunne's performance is beautifully restrained as the humble, selfless matriach who possesses an indomitable spirit and generous heart.  The rest of the talented ensemble includes familiar and beloved actors such as Oscar Homolka, Barbara Bel Geddes aka Miss Ellie on the television series ""Dallas"", and Ellen Corby of ""The Waltons"" fame.""I Remember Mama"" is the kind of movie that will evoke childhood memories and remind you to appreciate where you came from and how far you've arrived.",5,Gentle and evocative,1115596800,"05 9, 2005",2005,1434,"['Remember', 'Mama', 'gentle', 'compassionate', 'portrait', 'family', 'Norwegian', 'immigrants', 'who', 'settle', 'San', 'Francisco', 'early', '1900', 'movie', 'narrated', 'family', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'now', 'adult', 'who', 'written', 'memoir', 'childhood', 'colorful', 'family', 'family', 'Mama', 'Papa', 'siblings', 'overbearing', 'well-intentioned', 'aunts', 'uncle.Nothing', 'sensational', 'terribly', 'exciting', 'happens', 'lives', 'ordinary', 'working', 'class', 'immigrants', 'Yet', 'extraordinary', 'poignance', 'way', 'family', 'deals', 'everyday', 'crises', 'such', 'fate', 'injured', 'pet', 'cat', 'dilemma', 'mother', 'who', 'not', 'allowed', 'see', 'child', 'hospital.Acclaimed', 'director', 'George', 'Stevens', 'reconstructs', 'such', 'events', 'honesty', 'delicacy', 'long', 'movie', 'Stevens', 'superb', 'performances', 'cast', 'led', 'Irene', 'Dunne', 'title', 'character', 'Mama', 'Dunne', 'performance', 'beautifully', 'restrained', 'humble', 'selfless', 'matriach', 'who', 'indomitable', 'spirit', 'generous', 'heart', 'rest', 'talented', 'ensemble', 'familiar', 'beloved', 'actors', 'such', 'Oscar', 'Homolka', 'Barbara', 'Bel', 'Geddes', 'aka', 'Miss', 'Ellie', 'television', 'series', 'Dallas', 'Ellen', 'Corby', 'Waltons', 'fame', 'Remember', 'Mama', 'kind', 'movie', 'will', 'evoke', 'childhood', 'memories', 'remind', 'appreciate', 'where', 'came', 'how', 'far', ""'ve"", 'arrived']",I Remember Mama VHS

Mama and Papa are 2 very special people, but Mama is the heart of the family. They don't have very much money so many times they have to make a count of what money there is before they spend it. Uncle Chris teaches the young boy how to say a swear word, only to hear that Mama doesn't favor it. Uncle Chris is the head of the family, so to speak, as what he says goes. The 2 aunts are mostly full of talk, but that doesn't count with the rest of the family. One day Mama and the younger daughter take a walk on one of the streets in San Francisco and they stop in a store so that her daughter can buy a pencil box. Mama has to do without what she wants in order to make her daughter happy. Soon the family has to make a decision on a major need that they have. The younger daughter takes the pencil box back to the store and Mama gives her broche to a seller. It was a keepsake of the family. The older daughter wanted to take a trip to a place that she was anxious to go to and that is why the family went without things that they had so that she could make the trip. The younger daughter is disappointed and asks why she couldn't go instead of her older sister. Mama stops her fussing. Near the end of the movie Uncle Chris is in bed as he thinks that he is about to die. He has all of the family come around him and now and then Uncle Chris asks for ""a drink"", an alcoholic beverage. Mama doesn't agree that he should have it, but now and then he asks for a drink. Mama gives in and gives him a drink and she also takes a drink to please him. Uncle Chris keeps talking for some time, but then he dies. The movie is about the everyday life of a poor family who comes from another country to live in the United States. There are many times that Mama goes without what she wants so as to make her family happy. Irene Dunne is Mama and she plays her role excellently. Papa is another that does his role just as good as his wife. The younger daughter starts the movie with part of the story of their family and now and then she adds more to it as the film goes on. This is a must see movie. They don't make movies like this any more. When you see it for the first time you will want to see it again and again.",5,A Heartwarming Classic,1275004800,"05 28, 2010",2010,2278,"['story', 'loving', 'family', 'uncle', 'aunts', 'Mama', 'Papa', 'are', '2', 'very', 'special', 'people', 'Mama', 'heart', 'family', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'very', 'much', 'money', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'make', 'count', 'what', 'money', 'spend', 'Uncle', 'Chris', 'young', 'boy', 'how', 'say', 'swear', 'word', 'only', 'hear', 'Mama', ""n't"", 'favor', 'Uncle', 'Chris', 'head', 'family', 'so', 'speak', 'what', '2', 'aunts', 'are', 'mostly', 'full', 'talk', ""n't"", 'count', 'rest', 'family', 'One', 'day', 'Mama', 'younger', 'daughter', 'take', 'walk', 'one', 'streets', 'San', 'Francisco', 'stop', 'store', 'daughter', 'can', 'buy', 'pencil', 'box', 'Mama', 'do', 'what', 'order', 'make', 'daughter', 'happy', 'Soon', 'family', 'make', 'decision', 'major', 'need', 'have', 'younger', 'daughter', 'pencil', 'box', 'back', 'store', 'Mama', 'broche', 'seller', 'was', 'keepsake', 'family', 'older', 'daughter', 'wanted', 'take', 'trip', 'place', 'was', 'anxious', 'go', 'why', 'family', 'went', 'things', 'had', 'so', 'could', 'make', 'trip', 'younger', 'daughter', 'disappointed', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'go', 'instead', 'older', 'sister', 'Mama', 'fussing', 'end', 'movie', 'Uncle', 'Chris', 'bed', 'die', 'family', 'come', 'now', 'then', 'Uncle', 'Chris', 'drink', 'alcoholic', 'beverage', 'Mama', ""n't"", 'agree', 'should', 'have', 'now', 'then', 'drink', 'Mama', 'drink', 'also', 'drink', 'please', 'Uncle', 'Chris', 'talking', 'time', 'then', 'movie', 'everyday', 'life', 'poor', 'family', 'who', 'country', 'live', 'United', 'States', 'are', 'many', 'times', 'Mama', 'what', 'so', 'make', 'family', 'happy', 'Irene', 'Dunne', 'Mama', 'role', 'excellently', 'Papa', 'role', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'wife', 'younger', 'daughter', 'movie', 'part', 'story', 'family', 'now', 'then', 'more', 'film', 'must', 'see', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'movies', 'more', 'When', 'see', 'first', 'time', 'will', 'want', 'see', 'again', 'again']",I Remember Mama VHS
