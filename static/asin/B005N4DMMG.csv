I've always believed that film should be judged by its own merits.  While I often prefer not to read the book before the movie, `Atlas Shrugged' gives me an advantage that doesn't preclude the merits of this one.At the beginning, the dialogue and exposition are so lackluster that I nearly threw in the towel and joined in with the chorus to condemn this film.For those who are unfamiliar with either the epic book by Ayn Rand or this movie, I'll make it brief:  The U.S. economy is in a tailspin (much like today), and government regulation is allegedly choking all economic endeavor, including the heartbeat of the steel, metals, oil, and railroad industries.  Lined up on one side, are the heroes and heroines who keep the motor of the economy vibrantly working:  Dagny Taggart (femme fatale and one of two heads of the Taggart Railroad industry); Hank Reardon (an Andrew Carnegie-like figure who owns a steel firm), Francisco D'Anconia (an Argentinean copper mogul), and Ellis Wyatt (a Colorado oil tycoon).  On the other side, are the movers and shakers of liberal reform, who are breaking up monopoly ownership.  The head villain (as they're painted in Rand's view) is Dagny's own brother, James, a liberal with ties to the government who destroys the thrust of his family's business.  Wesley Mouch (Michael Lerner), one of the chief antagonists found in the intelligentsia, is on a mission to balance the scales of justice by ripping these industries apart.  In the shadows, lurks the mysterious figure of John Galt, whose presence can only be guessed at, and is the prime mover of Rand's mystery, so flippantly referred to in the ongoing clich&eacute; question: ""Who is John Galt?""  All the while the movers and shakers are disappearing.  At heart, Galt may be to blame.Yes, this is a short synopsis.Taylor Schilling plays Dagny, and while she demonstrates her steely reserve, she doesn't deliver much of her passion. Paul Johansson, self-cast as John Galt, also directs the film.  Where the force of the dialogue and passion of his players is lost, Johansson makes up with some splendidly shot scenes.  Sumptuous indeed is this film to look at, and cinematographer, Ross Berryman, undoubtedly will still have a career after this film. But, the dialogue and whirlwind of consequential events takes traction consequently late in the movie, so late, that the cliffhanger ending will not have enough of the newly initiated caring about 'Part 2'.As for John Aglialoro and Brian Patrick O'Toole's screenplay, it did not meet the par expectation that books be translated well to the big screen. I am no prude.*  I know that expletives sometimes give the dialogue more punch, but Ayn Rand didn't need to use expletives to give her words more power.  Here they are gratuitous--a method of injecting vitality into their own inadequate screenwriting.  Both the director and writers missed the ball for creating a dramatic delivery. Yes, the party scenes would make the producers of `Dynasty - Seasons 1 & 2' green with envy, the cable news headlines are realistic enough, and the shots of autumnal splendor in Colorado aboard a train are worthy of an advertising travel award, but this is not enough.If Ayn Rand ever saw this film she would shudder.  To paraphrase Barbara Braden in `The Passion of Ayn Rand,' Rand was beside herself over a key line that was changed for the celluloid version of `The Fountainhead' starring Gary Cooper, which compromised the whole meaning of her book.  Imagine her consternation over a production (and Braden did document how Rand so coveted a movie version of `Atlas Shrugged,' which went unrealized partly because of her iron hand) which contained this much mediocrity and with merits for the aspects she would have cared least.Is there a movie version of `Atlas Shrugged' that would be the libertarians' counterpart to `The Grapes of Wrath'?  Your guess is as good as mine.Still, `Atlas Shrugged, Part 1' might be a minor triumph for conservatives looking for a major release that is akin to their beliefs.  (That is why George Clooney will never play Hank Reardon.)  Compared to `An American Carol' there is room for greater satisfaction.  After all, how many times can you watch a Michael Moore-type character get slapped around like it's a `Three Stooges' marathon?Added to my judgment, I have already peeked at others' reviews of this `Part 1,' and one of the biggest hurdles was to try and erase these biases and write my own review.  In hindsight, I'd say it wasn't much of a hindrance, and I'm, undoubtedly, much kinder than those who went before me.  I do disagree with Roger Ebert's assertion that the love scenes could have shown more because libertarians might like ""thumpy"" as much as the next audience member, but I thought they left more to the imagination.(*'Ordinary People' wouldn't have resounded nearly as well without the expletives.  In contrast, `The Last Boy Scout' demonstrated the difference between real life and art by making profanity so pervasive that it lost its effect.)(Some information for this film, primarily credits,

They are not like any other stories I have read.  They have a tendency to show why being a statist is bad for the individual and the country. It shows what happens when you are in a complete democracy where the people only elect people that use the taxes collected to give them a free ride until there are no more taxpayers.  Remind you of anyone.  I heard through some friends about this movie and I was very excited to see it.  It was only in theaters for a couple of weeks before they pulled it.Well I was surprised how they wrote the screenplay I don't even remember if they used incredulous like the book does so much, I think it was Ayn Rand's favorite phrase; they followed the story of the first part of the book pretty well. I really like the actress who played Dabney Taggert being intelligent, hard working engineer and the actor who played Hank Reardon who was not intimidated by others and was a self made man.  The things that they were doing in the movie seemed to remind me of some of the things our government is trying to push down our throats.  Now I live in Chicago and as you can imagine that many people would not go see this movie on principle.  I think that people are not seeing it on purpose because they are afraid of what they might find out.  The building of the John Gault line with the Reardon metal and the bridge was pretty cool and I found it exciting.If the movie is so bad, how come everyone in the theater I was in stood up and clapped after the movie and it was a Chicago theater?I cannot wait until they release the Blue ray DVD.  I cannot understand the delay with all the other bad movies that come out right away. Why is the industry so afraid of this movie? It is like it is Citizen Kane and Hollywood is playing the William Randolph Hearst part of trying to kill it.

1495049,A3O9452VWFQDRJ,B005N4DMMG,"A. CHIASSON ""AlexC""","[13, 31]","For the record I've read the book in 1984 when I was seventeen...  I loved it!  All 1084 pages in a small print worn-out paperback edition...  It took me two months to read and, in retrospect, think that it was probably one of the most cinematographic novels ever written and it very well grounded in its time.  Trains, cigarettes, male-domination, traditional gender roles, and even race (does anybody remember any African-American of any importance in the book?) etc...  Capitalism had not gone through the Reagan years and was defended by people of great intellect like Hayek, etc...  Nazism was a not so distant memory and Stalinism in all its forms was a reality for a great part of the world and was a threat in some major powers such as France...  Fascist-type dictatorships were close allies of ours (and I am including us Canadians in the equation)...  The validity and the power of the novel's ideas lied in its context:  collectivism (either via socialism, crony capitalism or corporatism) was a real threat to an ideal that had been a great part of the American psyche and a very real dimension that helped it become a world power... The ideas developed by such giants as John Locke and Adam Smith were being eroded by an emerging massified society...  To be blunt, it was a brilliant piece of fiction that presented a critique of a strong tendency that was emerging in the post WW2 context...  Its arguments were not only valid and well grounded in a reality but they had a force that was both sober and idealistic...  In short, it was inspiring because it was a call to action in the real world!But here we are in 2012!  For whatever reason we have to make a movie with such material...  Probably the most cinematographic novel ever written!  Small dunk you'd think...  It's all there...  And with CGI, where any era of the past or future can be recreated or invented, there is no need for large sets &agrave; la Cleopatra and Ben Hur (192?) and (1959)...  No... A movie that explores Ayn Rand's ideas and grounds them in their proper zeitgeist isn't a problem anymore...  Logistically it's all there... Intelligent people will get over the time warp...  Heck, everybody seems to love Mad Men (I do!!!)!What they did was to create a disaster scenario in the vein of a cheap Rapture movie (the end of the world is coming -Haaaaaaa!) and literally invent a preposterous event such as a return to railway as the only (airplanes are destroyed en masse) means of mass transportation...  The X-file type effect (when white business men disappears to build an ideal community - the Utopia of Greed) brings a level of tackiness to the movie that erodes any type credibility that it could have...  The acting is pathetic and wooden...  Even the love scene between our heroes borders on necrophilia...  I am sorry but when they rescue a bank CEO and send him to the Utopia of Greed I could not believe it!  Maybe it was an add-in to get the movie's budget approved.  Whatever reasons, this movie (if viewed by people who have not read the book) destroys Ayn Rand's ideas one by one...If you want to see a bad adaption of a great novel, this is it!  It's like Plan 9 from Outer Space on steroids meets 2012 (the one with Woody Harrelson)...  If you're with friends and had a couple too many, put it into the DVD player and blast it!  It has more camp value than any movie done in the 80s...  That - I'm afraid - is its redeeming value.",1,The worst adaptation of a novel EVER!!!

1495050,AFJNWPKMIOYBP,B005N4DMMG,"A. Friedman ""life enthusiast""","[3, 10]","Few people would watch this solely for its mediocre ""entertainment"" value. This is politics in story form. Virtually everyone watches it for the political, economic, moral, & philosophical content. Most viewers likely already read Ayn Rand and are strongly polarized for or against her message. I praised her books back in the 1970's but am appalled by how Milton Friedman, the Chicago Boys (economists), and conservatives since Reagan have single-mindedly modeled both foreign & domestic economic policies after the strict essence of her selfish rugged-individualist ideals (without regard to corruption, human rights, militarism, and other factors).Political conservatives will love this flick, give it 5 stars, and shout ""I told you so!"" Liberals will hate it but might learn a little from it. Thoughtful, non-polarized viewers can watch it from a broader perspective and observe the compulsive, knee-jerk political reactivity of most citizens.First the good: This accurately, lucidly portrays Ayn Rand's Objectivism. All liberals and open-minded thinking people should watch it both to learn her message (which certainly has merits) and to understand the minds of conservatives. It well demonstrates the virtue of selfishness, greed, and competition and their role in building a great country and also demonstrates (in a blunt, simplistic, heavy-handed manner) the folly in trying to legislate altruism (e.g. welfare) and how government meddling in the name of ""social equality"" is often very counter-productive.Now the bad: This is truly a ""piece of work,"" unashamedly romanticizing radically conservative values and brazenly bashing humanistic values. Idealogues (e.g. GW Bush & Milton Friedman) and simple-minded folks (e.g. those who voted for GWB in 2004) will be captivated and mesmerized by the overly simplified black & white moral message, and that is why I give it only two stars. It deepens & prolongs the sleep of these rote-conservative simpletons, who are its intended audience. The captains of industry are portrayed as solely responsible for our nation's successes: innovators, job creators, wealth creators, etc. (Trickle down exemplified.) The progressives are totally 100% vilified as purely obstructionist, trying to give away all wealth, remove all market incentives, and drive us all into abject poverty. Being set in a dysfunctional USA only 5 years away (2016), it suggests that these liberals are entirely responsible for all our economic woes and that those heroic corporations and wealthy CEOs are our only hope for salvation, if we would stop strangling them with regulations. Most blatantly backwards are the many scenes where liberals are busily cutting all the dirty back-room political deals while our heroic capitalist titans are morally above such depravities. Wow! The extreme right wing has an amazing capacity for reversing facts! (As illustrated by Orwellian titles like Healthy Forests Initiative, Clean Skies Act, and No Child Left Behind.)My take-home message: Liberals must learn to apply public policies only at critical choke points, using the invisible hand of the market to carry their effect, so as to avoid perverse incentives and unintended consequences. For example, a simple carbon tax on fossil fuels at the mine or well-head will be far more reliable and predictable than solar incentives, compact fluorescent subsidies, incandescent bans, ""cash for clunkers"", cap & trade, and a gazillion other policies that unintentionally and arbitrarily ""rob Peter to pay Paul,"" as partially illustrated by this movie. Conservatives must learn that the benefits of selfishness and competition do not apply to monopolistic practices (e.g. Microsoft), cooked books (e.g. Enron), corporate subsidies (e.g. oil & corn), tax loopholes (e.g. hedge fund managers), government revolving door corruption (e.g. FDA run by Monsanto or VP Cheney arranging no-bid contracts to his Halliburton), externalized costs (e.g. Walmart instructing its underpaid workers on applying for Food Stamps), and ...THE MULTI-TRILLION DOLLAR BAILOUT!Were Ayn Rand alive today, I wonder if she would approve of the vast trans-national corporate powers, world trade agreements, tax dodges, bank deregulations, and governmental corruptions that have been done in her name.",2,liberals should watch this ultra-right fairytale,1323475200,"12 10,

I expected it would be set, as the novel was, in the thirties or forties. The adaptation moved it into the near future which surprised me yet it actually worked very well. The acting was great, and the Dagny character is fantastic. She perfectly depicts the tough business woman that brooks no nonsense yet, at the same time is sexy and attractive. Ditto for the Hank Roark character who exemplifies the titanic struggle of the creator against the mass of the state. That there are parallels with current affairs only makes the timing perfect.If I have one criticism to make is that the movie seems rushed. The bedroom scene of Roark and his wife, important to set the basis for his (sexual) relationship with Dagny, is so short that you may miss it and if you do, it may change the way you view Hank. I would have preferred a slightly longer treatment of the story although, for today's audiences, this faster pace might actually be better received.Ignore the bad reviews. Who cares what the Bertram Scudders say. The reason professional reviewers trash this movie is the same reason it wasn't made by any big name Hollywood director, who would have destroyed it anyway. It is also the same reason Ayn Rand could not find characters to play ""We the Living"" when she tried it to produce it as a Broadway play.

1495063,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,B005N4DMMG,Andres C. Salama,"[1, 4]","A film version (the first part of a planned trilogy that might never be made) of the magnum opus of famous Libertarian author Ayn Rand. It might be surprising that despite the book having sold millions of copies since it first came out in 1957, Hollywood could only release decades later a low budget version of it, with a no name cast (the only actors that I could recognize from other films, and I am a frequent moviegoer, were Jon Polito and Michael Lerner, who have played supporting roles in several movies by the Coen Brothers).The movie is about how two businessmen (Dagny Taggart, played by the pretty Taylor Schilling, who runs a troubled railroad company and Hank Rearden who builds a special metal for its tracks) are repeatedly thwarted in their plans to create a great railroad by government intrusion and regulation. Meanwhile, some businessmen are mysteriously disappearing, all of which would presumably be explained in the two remaining movies (Almost all the characters shown in the film are wealthy businessmen, apparently the only people that Ayn Rand found interesting).It is curious that while the movie is set in 2016, the most important industry in the US seems to be the railroads. I think it would have been better if the filmmakers used two other options here, either they could have set the film in the fifties, as in the book, and keep the trains, or they should set it in the near future around a more contemporary industry (like computers, or biotech, or any other similar).The film starts a bit stilted and has a lot of clunky dialogue, and it is mostly about the characters talking and expressing their political and philosophical opinions. Yet, one has to admit that the movie has certain integrity in not watering down the author's libertarian message (despite it being presumably an unpopular one in the artistic community and with the cultural elite). And the movie gets better as it goes along, and by the end I found it being quite compelling, despite its limitations.",3,Low budget adaptation of Ayn Rand's masterwork is flawed but interesting,1327536000,"01 26, 2012",2012,2007,"['film', 'version', 'first', 'part', 'planned', 'trilogy', 'might', 'never', 'be', 'made', 'magnum', 'opus', 'famous', 'Libertarian', 'author', 'Ayn', 'Rand', 'might', 'be', 'surprising', 'book', 'having', 'sold', 'millions', 'copies', 'first', 'came', 'out', '1957', 'Hollywood', 'could', 'only', 'release', 'decades', 'later', 'low', 'budget', 'version', 'name', 'cast', 'only', 'could', 'recognize', 'other', 'films', 'am', 'frequent', 'moviegoer', 'were', 'Jon', 'Polito', 'Michael', 'Lerner', 'who', 'have', 'played', 'supporting', 'roles', 'several', 'movies', 'Coen', 'Brothers', '.The', 'movie', 'how', 'two', 'businessmen', 'Dagny', 'Taggart', 'played', 'pretty', 'Taylor', 'Schilling', 'who', 'troubled', 'railroad', 'company', 'Hank', 'Rearden', 'who', 'special', 'metal', 'tracks', 'are', 'repeatedly', 'thwarted', 'plans', 'create', 'great', 'railroad', 'government', 'intrusion', 'regulation', 'Meanwhile', 'businessmen', 'are', 'mysteriously', 'disappearing', 'would', 'presumably', 'be', 'explained', 'two', 'remaining', 'movies', 'Almost', 'characters', 'shown', 'film', 'are', 'wealthy', 'businessmen', 'apparently', 'only', 'people', 'Ayn', 'Rand', 'found', 'interesting', '.It', 'curious', 'movie', 'set', '2016', 'most', 'important', 'industry', 'US', 'be', 'railroads', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'filmmakers', 'used', 'two', 'other', 'options', 'here', 'could', 'have', 'set', 'film', 'fifties', 'book', 'keep', 'trains', 'should', 'set', 'near', 'future', 'more', 'contemporary', 'industry', 'computers', 'biotech', 'other', 'similar', '.The', 'film', 'bit', 'stilted', 'lot', 'clunky', 'dialogue', 'mostly', 'characters', 'talking', 'expressing', 'political', 'philosophical', 'opinions', 'admit', 'movie', 'certain', 'integrity', 'not', 'watering', 'down', 'author', 'libertarian', 'message', 'being', 'presumably', 'unpopular', 'one', 'artistic', 'community', 'cultural', 'elite', 'movie', 'better', 'along', 'end', 'found', 'being', 'quite', 'compelling', 'limitations']",Atlas Shrugged: Part 1

There was ZERO marketing, and the reviewers all killed it with uniform wording (read, a ""talking points"" distribution sheet.)  If one is a ""Progressive"" big government Democrat, one hates this movie by definition.  The theater I was in was completely full, every seat.  There was applause-long applause- at the end of the movie. I had read ""Atlas Shrugged,"" so knew about the plot. However, the movie was structured so that one did not need to read the book to understand the movie. Hollywood did their best to ignore this movie.PRO:  The plot is excellent and the screenplay well done.  The visuals, especially the 200 mph train riding on high speed unique metal rails is spectacular.  The new alloy steel is SO GOOD, the government decides to nationalize the production facilities.  Society is collapsing due to government growth and severe control of businesses.  Ayn Rand saw the effect of the Soviet Communists firsthand, and echoed her revulsion of their policies in her book.CON:  The acting is interesting but not Oscar caliber.  The budget for the movie was not lavish, as it was ""blackballed"" by Hollywood for many years so its amazing it was ever made at all. Kudos to the producers.  Also, the overall Ayn Rand philosophy makes no provision for belief in God, or helping others voluntarily.  Only transactional relationships are involved, which is a flaw, and a result of Rand's upbringing in the Soviet Union.Nevertheless, this is a good movie to have on your home bookshelf as you will never find it for rental in your local store, and its a good conversation starter even if one does not agree with all the precepts of the storyline.",5,"Viewers loved it- Critics hated it (""those that can, do.

1495069,AHZJ4KTYBQ5KP,B005N4DMMG,Avrohom Leichtling,"[2, 5]","Having looked through the mass of official press criticism of this film, I come away feeling that the vast majority of print reviewers are more guided by the need to slight the film on political grounds, and denigrate the rest of it in diatribes utterly uncalled-for and inaccurate. I would go further and suggest that these guilty parties have probably not had much more contact with the original source, the novel, other than perhaps from some underground Cliff notes written by some manner of left-wing loon who also likely did not read the novel (but heard about it from some community organizer type politician).That said, such comments about the film, and as the basis for review of an artistic effort are inaccurate and unacceptable precisely because of their common political position. Such reviews sink to same sewer level as the majority of our so-called mainstream media which, in viewing the general public as hopelessly stupid and, therefore corruptible, can completely throw off its public responsibility (...) to remain neutral in all matters political and stick solely to the facts accurately reported.As to Ayn Rand's work - the simple minded leftists in our midst will find the book far too detailed in the exposition of its ""objectivist"" philosophy. That Rand was an atheist is something which I, as a religious man, can not easily swallow - however, that aside, her basic premise is sound and is eerily prescient. Its various concepts and dialogues are with us to day in our current political climate in a way that must have seemed improbable in the USA of 1957. However, bearing in mind that Rand was raised under Stalinism, her polemic was, and remains a clear warning of the dangers of political tyranny and its economic, social and cultural consequences. She saw the early signs and responded in kind.The film does more than an adequate job of providing a neat and clean summary of the novel's first part. That it glosses over some things, omits others and truncates or otherwise finds redaction necessary is hardly anything new in cinema. One reads Lord of the Rings, and then goes to Peter Jackson's films and recognizes immediately that the novel has been reduced to a series of verbal grunts and snippets with all of Tolkein's poetry completely removed and replaced with unending visual spectacle. In my opinion, the two bear only the most tangential relationship to each other. LOTR, the film, is either a cruel redaction of a great piece of linguistic virtuosity, or a visually spectacular fantasy loosely based on Tolkein's mythology. To have left Rand's often extremely lengthy speeches intact would have produced a movie easily four or five hours long - something not unusual in Soviet cinema but rarely encountered in American films.Atlas Shrugged - Part I, the movie, is not a visual fantasy - it is rather a thoughtful and extremely dense drama which, in the course of its 98 minutes can barely give the outline of the first third of the 1100 page novel. It is, however, done tastefully - its dialogue is drawn freely but accurately from Rand's novel (redactive creation notwithstanding), the use of little known actors a brilliant stroke forcing viewers to concentrate on ideas and not on screen personalities. Part II, just released, has a completely different cast than Part I.Rand's message has little to do with ""free market capitalism"" in the sense that our left-wing useful idiots would have you believe. It's central message concerns the right of the creator to profit from his creation because he created it, he put in the effort to create it, he acquired the knowledge and skill to create it, and is therefore the only one entitled to reap its benefits. Those whom he employs to help him accomplish his creation are paid solely according to their skill and ability. This is why we have the legal concepts and constructs of copyright and patent together with the legal mechanisms to enforce the rights of the creator. Rand's whole argument is against those who would force a man to give up what is his own creation in the face of threats and actual intellectual theft that is the power of a corrupted legal system justifying what in any other circumstance would be called robbery under the guise of ""the greater good."" Our useful idiots scream bloody murder when their ideas are co-opted by others. Curious, then, how when it comes to THEIR work, they evolve rapidly into John Galt - but when it comes to something they WANT, but did nothing to produce, then John Galt becomes an enemy of the people (and how quintessentially Stalinist is that, eh?). In the end, it is a study of hypocrisy gone global to the detriment of everyone. The film, in its own quiet way, makes its case simply and without any of the hyperbole common in much of our otherwise mindless cinema",5,Solid adaptation of Atlas Shrugged - Part I,1350259200,"10 15,

We Christians see this as the Books of Daniel and Revelations coming true, and fully expect to hear that trumpet blow, literally any minute now.  And some (evidentally) ""ex-hippie"" sorts believe that the end cometh this December 21, either by the sun sort of ""breaking wind"" and incinerating the earth, or (this one is good!) ""naughty alien reptiles"" conquering the earth.  Myself, I tend to disagree on that point - I mean, who are YOU to make conjecture as to when God is gonna say, ""Blow the trumpet, Gabriel, I can't deal with them any longer.""  ""Atlas Shrugged"" is a rather secular conjecture about the ""end of time,"" infinitely more believable than the ""naughty alien"" thing.  In truth, though, I found ""Atlas Shrugged"" more akin to Fritz Lang's 1926 masterpiece, ""Metropolis,"" you know, that riff about those who ""have,"" and those who ""want it"" - except when Georgio Moroder got hold of ""Metropolis"" in, what, '84? he increased its value exponentially by adding sound, color, and that freaking BRILLIANT music! Still: the ""rich have it and the poor want it,"" blah-blah-blah, only, in the the case of ""Atlas Shrugged,"" people seem to be mysteriously disappearing from the face of the earth.  I haven't read the book - yet - nor had I even seen ""Atlas"" till last weekend, when a kind of...serious friend, down in Georgia, played ""Altas"" for me, after a rather lenghty dinner debate about eschatology (that means ""pertaining to the end of the world/judgement"" kind of thing), and after the movie, I reiterated (what would be a ""hook line"" if we were talking about pop muzak), ""Who IS John Galt?,"" the question raised in the movie as to ""why"" and ""by/for whom"" these disappearences are occurring.  I have shopping today, and tomorrow night, I'm going to rehearse with a new band: but you can just BET that Saturday, I'll see ""Atlas Shrugged II.""

1495081,A1GB0HW46Y2EB,B005N4DMMG,Bruce G. Taylor,"[1, 4]","In order to understand what Ayn Rand was driving at in ""Atlas Shrugged,"" it is necessary to read not only the novel but her philosophical works such as ""The Virtues of Selfishness,"" ""Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal"" and ""Objectivist Epistemology.""She begins her philosophy of objectivism by stating that we live in a physical universe as physical creatures.  She asserts that we exist as a manifestation of nature and she rejects all notions of spiritualism and mysticism, i.e. religious belief of any kind.  All living things have attributes that contribute to their existence.  Man's essential attribute in maintaining his existence is his ability to reason.  She sees any belief in the spiritual or mystical as an abandonment of reason since  there are no physical or tangible aspects to support the existence of these beliefs.In a television interview, her interviewer said that she could not determine that there is no such thing as God and she, as an avowed atheist, simply responded by saying: ""I cannot be called upon to prove a negative.  If you make the assertion that God exists, the burden is on you prove it.""Her reductive reasoning is that of a human being making the statement: ""I exist and I am conscious"" which is, in itself, sufficient since that human could not say the opposite: ""I am not conscious; I do not exist.""  In other words: ""Existence exists!  No further proof is required.From her belief in the essential importance of reason as a necessary attribute to ensure man's existence her entire philosophy flows.  Man has a right to his existence as long as he is able to maintain it.  He maintains his existence by his work, largely guided by his ability to reason.  If man has the right to exist, he then has the right to keep the fruits of his own work to maintain his existence and is under no obligation whatever (and therefore cannot be forced) to sacrifice the fruits of  his work to support others as an act of altruism, which she defines as a sacrifice of one's own values for the sake of another person.  She defines ""others"" as  strangers to that man.  A man who works to support his family is not making a sacrifice in such a case as the existence and well-being of his family (or a close friend or relative) are presumably among his top values in life and it is therefore a selfish act.This ultimately leads to her belief in unfettered capitalism as the system which leaves man free to achieve his goals and to keep the fruits of those goals if he achieves them and she therefore regards any form of government which forces a man to work for the support of others by means of slavery, feudalism, socialism, communism, fascism, etc.as inherently evil and brutal.  She isn't too far from Adam Smith in her philosophy and some say Rand's philosophy of economics is essentially warmed over Adam Smith.  This is essentially the message she repeats endlessly in ""Atlas Shrugged"" and her other works such as ""The Fountainhead"" and ""We the Living.""  You have to take it or leave it.

1495092,A1PHDKFH72YBS6,B005N4DMMG,"C.G. BANGSNOT ""C.G.""","[29, 56]","I'm a capitalist and an Ayn Rand fan. But there's a reality out there that many do not want to accept: certain novels just don't work and can't work on the big screen. This is not the first Ayn Rand novel to be made into a movie.  The first one was ""The Fountainhead.""  The hero of that novel gives a speech which reads:""Thousands of years ago, the first man discovered how to make fire. He was probably burned at the stake he had taught his brothers to light.""Centuries later, the first man invented the wheel. He was probably torn on the rack he had taught his brothers to build. He was considered a transgressor who ventured into forbidden terrritory. But thereafter, men could travel past any horizon. He had left them a gift they had not conceived and he had opened the roads of the world.""And it goes on like that for many more paragraphs.It makes for powerful prose in a novel.  Delivered by a character onscreen, it's sounds and looks ridiculous.  I'm sorry, it just does.Atlas Shrugged shrugged encounters then same problem.A typical exchange in the film goes like this:MYSTERIOUS STRANGER: ""Midas Mulligan?""MM: ""Who are you?""STRANGER: ""Someone who works for himself and not let others feed off the profits of his energy.""Once again, riveting prose in a novel, ludicrous dialog onscreen.Simply put, Atlas Shrugged the novel is more of a philosophy handbook than a novel. Turning such a tome into a screenplay is a near-impossible task.  Powerful ideas can't be easily condensed into sound bytes, and no one should try.But the other problem with the film is that it takes place in the 21st century, whereas the novel was written in the 1950s. Railroads were a great innovation back then maybe. This is the age of the passenger jet, the iphone, and the electric car. A movie about railroad companies is by itself a dated concept.Read the novel.

Eventually all the producers go on strike and leave to live together in a mythical valley somewhere in Colorado. The leading character John Galt, is Rand's ideal person who ,like the rest of his associates, who like the mythical Atlas, are forced to carry the rest of the world on their shoulders and then are punished for their inventiveness, individualism and strengh of character. Rather than continue to submit to an increasingly oppresive government, they choose to leave their wretched countrymen and live in a valley in Colorado which cannot be seen from above....Remember this is a fantasy. John Galt and the Colorado episode is not seen until Part III.The story is much more complex and magical than my description....You really need to read the book.One of the problems with the movie is that the producers tried to make the movie realistic and set it in the 21st century...It's about the great days of railroading and steam power and it does not fit well into the current time. The novel is romantic and rather magical in nature and does not come accross all that well as it is depicted on screen. Spielberg could have made this a great movie, but alas, the movie's very conservative philiosohical theme would preclude the liberal Speilberg and most other Hollywood folks from touching the subject. This might partially explain the many bad reviews from the mostly liberal media crictics.Besides the problems I mentioned above, it has some other issues in that it was produced independently at a fairly low cost and it features some actors I have seen before, but no great stars.Taylor Schilling is very believable as Dagny, but the rest are variable in their portrayals of the other characters. That said, it is a pretty accurate rendition of Rand's novel and her philosophy of individualism and her reverence for the indiviual and the right to live one's life for one's own pleasure and not as a sacrificial lamb for the non producers of society or the state.It's a good thing that the movie was made even if it is not ideal and it certainly deserves viewing. The producers deserve our thanks for their effort.

The most disturbing part of this film and the book is how accurately it tracks what is happening in our country today.  I live in ""The Peoples Democratic Republic of"" California.  Atlas is definitely shrugging in the golden state.  As government largess grows and taxes on the producers increase and regulations stifle any productive activity the ""makers"" are leaving the promised land and the ""takers"" are taking over. California is on the verge of bankruptcy because of its liberal anti capitalist ideology.  Once flourishing businesses are abandoning the state and the politicians are too stupid (or brain locked) to recognize why.  Once, if a nation, California would have been seventh in the world economy, now it falls behind Greece as an economic power. Ayn Rand foresaw this in the 1950's.  Her life experience in Russia showed her what the collective would do to human existence and what central planning would do to the economy. I just wish there was a John Galt around to show the way and a ""Midas Junction"" offering an escape from the Orwellian nightmare that Progressives and liberals are turning into a terrible reality.  Rand viewed man as a potentially noble being.  She also realized that nobility comes at a price and that price is recognition of the supremacy of the individual over the mob.

1495103,AKUAGNGYKA0SE,B005N4DMMG,Cleveland Confidential,"[1, 4]","OMG! ""ATLAS SHRUGGED Part I"" is the ""Lord of the Rings"" of Moral Relativism(tm)(you might say; and I'll tell why I say it shortly). I loved the book and I LOVE this movie, which I saw tonight.Forget any negative non-sense you may have heard about this great film. Personally, I don't follow popular culture and I've stopped paying attention to Ayn Rand fans since most of them (for ethnic reasons, it turns out) refuse to face up to who really did nine-one-one, but I digress.So I was pleasantly surprised (shocked, actually) when I saw this DVD sitting on the shelf at the public library this afternoon. I brought it right home and popped it into the DVD player!All you need to know about ""Atlas Shrugged Part 1"" is that the mark of a good film lies in its ability to grab your attention and drag you into the story, managing to get you to suspend disbelief as you sit back and just watch it (like, to the end). Now I have honed my skills at entertaining ideas, as Aristotle put it (and Ayn truly LOVED Aristotle), so I can watch almost anything. Your mileage may vary, but I'd be willing to bet a few Reardon Rails that you are going to enjoy this film IF you make it past the first few minutes.As for the moral relativism issue, well moral relativism may be defined in several ways (hey, it's moral RELATIVISM, eh). Basically it means that morality is totally subjective, based upon what is good for you.Ayn Rand, being a curmudgeon like no other, and a misanthropic reprobate to boot, called her version of moral relativism ""OBJECTIVISM"" (and NO, Will Duncan, I am not trying to be facetious here; this is the God's honest truth, though Ayn didn't believe in one).Historian Paul Johnson penned a nasty little screed titled ""The Intellectuals"" that chucked the chick peas about how many leading intellectuals are creepy beyond belief and dishonest hypocrites as well -- sometimes even criminal. You should read it. Unless you are an intellectual lol. Johnson didn't include Ayn Rand in his book, but he should have because she carried these tendencies to the extreme, probably beyond any of the highly magnified featherless bipeds he did include in his table of contents).Ayn Rand micromanaged the lives and thoughts of her disciples; ruined people's lives and drove them mad; practiced illicit (and possibly perverted) sex with several of them, including perhaps her ethnic fellow Allen Greenspan; fell in love and sucked up to a serial killer; defended Einstein's reputation with smears and calumny; championed the bogus Austrian Economic theories of Ludwig Von Mises (which do not even attempt to furnish any mathematical proof that they are true, and thus are a soft -- e.g. unscientific -- science lol lol lol); she looked down her nose at the bicycle (it didn't go fast enough, I suppose); and Ayn did her level best to destroy Western Culture by teaching its members to shun any efforts to cooperate in their communities and improve the lot of one another, calling this ""collectivism,"" while her own ethnic tribe ""famously provided communal support and charitable assistance for their own."" Of course, Ayn's last name wasn't really ""Rand,"" but I'll leave it to you to learn what it was. If you have read this far, just Google the phrase ""Ayn Rand and The Trust."" Be warned that it leads to a blog that may seem ""hateful"" to the uninformed, so don't say I didn't warn you. I suppose that some things should be hated, and since this is still America, you retain the unalienable Right to read and think for yourself? As nasty as that may sound. You *are* literate, are you not? Capable of mentation? If so, and if you are not afraid to ""entertain ideas"" (with Aristotle), I wholeheartedly suggest that you take a peek and Google the phrase I typed above.OK. So you can't make a silk purse out of a sows ear, but you probably could write great literature on a parchment made from a pig's skin. Right?  Even a broken clock tells time correctly twice a day. Correct? In similar fashion, Ayn Rand managed to write two dynamite, books that are soooo spot-on about certain truths that are self-evident to all but the most terminally selfless, that so-called and self-styled altruists and progressives simply hate the very ground old Ayn walked upon. Every single square inch of it!Where, in my opinon, does this film version fall short? It doesn't, neither does the book. However, you must realize one very important thing, or your mind may be inoperably twisted by exposure to the ideas presented here.Ayn Rand offers what is known in the trade as a ""limited hangout."" In other words, she builds up her entire schtick upon a foundation that is missing its very cornerstone. This will certainly lead you to blame the very real culture distortion and the truly horrific effects of the altruistic hypocrisy that she describes... blame them upon the wrong people and causes. This is no big surprise, given her ethnic roots and their penchant for manipulating economic paradigms, including the current economic paradigm, which has been current since they created it about the time the Bank of ""England"" got its start. (What fun!)So... do I approve of the society that Atlas Shrugged appears to champion? As a fellow moral relativist, I confess that I do, because I would fit in very well and go far. So might you, if only you could clean out some of the non-sense from your mind, such ""mental cobwebs"" that keep you from noticing facts and from true mentation.

I have grown since, but I still can appreciate Rand's work seeing that she grew up in Soviet Russia and lived the harshness of communism.The movie is done in a very surrealistic-style, which is a style I appreciate and enjoy. Since this is to be three-part series, you do end ""Part 1"" with unanswered questions and the film may seem ""incomplete"" such as when you might have watched the first installment of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.

1495113,AHIK7BUXFRMT8,B005N4DMMG,David Bower,"[12, 17]","My wife and I both found the movie to be entertaining and involving; I believe that's significant because she is not really a fan of Ayn Rand and I am. When Ayn Rand was alive I subscribed to her ""Objectivist Newsletter"" and found the articles of interest and have read many of her books including most of her non-fiction works.I read ""Atlas Shrugged"" for the first time in 1971 and found it fascinating but not threatening; I have almost completed the book again and confess that the similarities to life in the United States today have become too much of a mirror to the events and attitudes found in the book. In that regard the book becomes more sinister in that it reflects to too great an extent the growing socialist attitudes found in this country at this time.I will try and limit my observations to the movie as a representation of what Ayn Rand presents in Part 1 of the book. My impression is the screenplay by John Aglialoro and Brian Patrick O'Toole has captured much of the essence of Part 1 in a rather neatly done condensation. Obviously much has been skipped but it seems to me enough of the message of Part 1 has been captured to make the movie version very worthwhile.Taylor Schilling does an excellent job in her role as Dagny Taggert as does Grant Bowler as Henry Rearden. I didn't have any problems with any of the other casting and felt the selected actors did a good job.Although my wife is not really familiar with Ayn Rand's ""objectivist philosophy"" she was able to enjoy the movie for what it presented as a movie; I do not feel it necessary that one be a fan of the philosophy to enjoy the movie.I am a fiscal conservative and can see how those with a liberal/progressive mindset could take offense at the movie. I've signed up to be notified when the movie is available for sale and will order the Blu-ray version as soon as it's available.The Atlas Shrugged Part 2 website is being set up and suggests Part 2 will be released to theaters in the fall of 2012.

Normally, when I watch a movie based on a great book or novel, the question always arises, how does it compare to the book?The book, Atlas Shrugged, is fantastic, but a bit too long toward the end, particularly to the impatient younger generation. The repeated question of ""Who is John Galt?"" becomes a bit old in the book, but not so in the movie.  So the answer- as far as Part 1 concerns us- is  the movie so far.  Why? The writing and the plot for both the book and the movie are a tour de force, but the movie, at a faster pace and with such actors that match the novel's characters so well, ""live and in color"" on the screen- may just tilt the balance!The movie is like the book, a cliffhanger of intrigue and suspense, but it just moves faster- and we want more!  The casting, moreover, is outstanding. Taylor Schilling and Grant Bowler give magnificent performances as Dagny Taggart and Hank Rearden, and so due the rest of the cast in their respective roles.  When Ayn Rand was alive her first pick to play Dagny Taggart was Farrah Fawcett in the 1970s, when Farrah was at her peak, but I don't see how equally beautiful Taylor Schilling could have been beaten!And the parallels with the present could not have been better chosen by Fate herself. The movie takes place in 2016, and America is teetering on the abyss of economic disaster, oil prices climbing out of sight, government collusion with business (who are cooperating with the increasingly socialistic American state) is rampant, regulations mount, economic freedom is being curtailed, individual liberty itself hangs on the balance. The most productive citizens are disappearing, while those who are dependent on the state are multiplying...the country is on the verge of revolution.

The main difficulty with this movie is that it overlooks a great deal of background information which Rand assumed the reader to had when she wrote the book. Today's reader may not have this background knowledge because these topics have not been as relevant as of late, which makes the foundation of the story somewhat less obvious as a result.

1495135,APBRAL723MUM4,B005N4DMMG,EJon,"[6, 7]","I'll admit, this movie was better than I expected.  I'm giving it three stars because it's worth watching if you read the book, whether you liked it or not.  I can't imagine you would want to watch the movie if you didn't read the book, but if you do, at least read the Wikipedia article, so you know what all the hype's about.  By and large, the movie is very faithful to the book, and that's both its strength and its weakness.First and foremost, there's the setting.  We're told the story takes place in 2016, but everything looks a lot the when the book was written, or maybe even a few years earlier. All the men wear suits and often hats, the women wear retro dresses and heavy makeup, and it looks like in four years people will start to get a lot of their information from newspapers again.  A little modern technology creeps in, but it doesn't really affect anything.  There are cell phones, but no texts, the occasional computer screen, but no one attempts to just google ""Who is John Galt?"".  Most importantly, trains and the steel industry are really important again (??).  They try to explain this with high fuel prices, but that would drive freight and commuter lines, not interstate passenger trains.  Whatever the reason, you just have to accept that Dagny's rail line and Hank's new steel appear to be the biggest news items of 2016.  I guess that means we won't have reality TV by then, and that at least is something.Don't get me wrong, I find the anachronistic atmosphere the biggest charm of the movie, but it gives it more the feel of an alternate history set in the 50s than a cautionary tale about a plausible future.All in all, the casting is good and the acting is decent, but again they're shackled to the book. If characters appear wooden and two dimensional, it's because that's how they were written. If you liked the book, you'll like the movie. If you *loved* the book, you'll *love* the movie.  That explains the split between the reviews by critics and the audience.  The critics had to see the movie, while the audience is a largely self-selecting group, predisposed to enjoy it.Personally, I always got the feeling that Rand considered readers somewhat thick. so rather than simply relying on the story to convey her rather obvious message, she insisted on having her characters forever launch into mini (or not so mini) lectures and non-sequitur conversations to further clarify her worldview - as if it needed clarification.  This kind of works in a book, where the line between dialog and narration can be blurred, but in the movie, I got the feeling the actors were rushing through the requisite sermons to keep them from dragging the pace even more than they already were.For all the reverent adherence to the book, I was a little surprised that the makers got a bad case of cold feet when it came to Rand's trademark rough sex imagery and decided to omit it entirely.  In the book, there's a smoldering passion between Hank and Dagny that culminates (like all Rand's ""love"" scenes) in a near rape.  In the movie, there's very little sexual chemistry between these characters, and when they finally consumate their relationship, it's in a scene so tepid that it wouldn't raise eyebrows in an ABC After School Special. It struck me that if Rand were alive today, that lukewarm love scene might be her biggest - and possibly only - complaint about the movie.Don't expect this movie to stand on its own. It just stops.  The makers clearly intend to make all three and expect you to see them all.  Luckily, I expect them all to appear on video/Netflix soon after they're released.I'm not an Ayn Rand sycophant, but I think she had some important things to say.  I believe that Atlas Shrugged could have been made into a decent movie by modernizing the plot and shortening it to something appropriate to its simple and straightforward message.  Through their religious devotion to the book, the makers have created something of a novelty.  Definitely worth watching if you read the book, but unlikely to be as world shaking as they clearly hoped.",3,Better than I expected,1350604800,"10 19, 2012",2012,4082,"[""'ll"", 'admit', 'movie', 'was', 'better', 'expected', ""'m"", 'giving', 'three', 'stars', 'worth', 'watching', 'read', 'book', 'liked', 'not', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'would', 'want', 'watch', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'do', 'least', 'read', 'Wikipedia', 'article', 'know', 'what', 'hype', 'large', 'movie', 'very', 'faithful', 'book', 'strength', 'weakness.First', 'foremost', 'setting', ""'re"", 'told', 'story', 'place', '2016', 'everything', 'lot', 'when', 'book', 'was', 'written', 'maybe', 'even', 'few', 'years', 'earlier', 'men', 'wear', 'suits', 'often', 'hats', 'women', 'wear', 'retro', 'dresses', 'heavy', 'makeup', 'four', 'years', 'people', 'will', 'start', 'get', 'lot', 'information', 'newspapers', 'again', 'little', 'modern', 'technology', 'creeps', ""n't"", 'really', 'affect', 'anything', 'are', 'cell', 'phones', 'texts', 'occasional', 'computer', 'screen', 'one', 'just', 'google', 'Who', 'John', 'Galt', 'Most', 'importantly', 'trains', 'steel', 'industry', 'are', 'really', 'important', 'again', 'try', 'explain', 'high', 'fuel', 'prices', 'would', 'drive', 'freight', 'commuter', 'lines', 'not', 'interstate', 'passenger', 'trains', 'reason', 'just', 'have', 'accept', 'Dagny', 'rail', 'line', 'Hank', 'new', 'steel', 'appear', 'be', 'biggest', 'news', 'items', '2016', 'guess', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'reality', 'TV', 'then', 'least', 'something.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'find', 'anachronistic', 'atmosphere', 'biggest', 'charm', 'movie', 'more', 'feel', 'alternate', 'history', 'set', '50s', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'plausible', 'future.All', 'casting', 'good', 'acting', 'decent', 'again', ""'re"", 'shackled', 'book', 'characters', 'appear', 'wooden', 'two', 'dimensional', 'how', 'were', 'written', 'liked', 'book', ""'ll"", 'like', 'movie', '*loved*', 'book', ""'ll"", '*love*', 'movie', 'split', 'reviews', 'critics', 'audience', 'critics', 'had', 'see', 'movie', 'audience', 'largely', 'self-selecting', 'group', 'predisposed', 'enjoy', 'it.Personally', 'always', 'got', 'feeling', 'Rand', 'considered', 'readers', 'somewhat', 'thick', 'so', 'rather', 'simply', 'relying', 'story', 'convey', 'rather', 'obvious', 'message', 'insisted', 'having', 'characters', 'forever', 'launch', 'mini', 'not', 'so', 'mini', 'lectures', 'non-sequitur', 'conversations', 'further', 'clarify', 'worldview', 'needed', 'clarification', 'kind', 'works', 'book', 'where', 'line', 'dialog', 'narration', 'can', 'be', 'blurred', 'movie', 'got', 'feeling', 'actors', 'were', 'rushing', 'requisite', 'sermons', 'keep', 'dragging', 'pace', 'even', 'more', 'already', 'were.For', 'reverent', 'adherence', 'book', 'was', 'little', 'surprised', 'makers', 'got', 'bad', 'case', 'cold', 'feet', 'when', 'came', 'Rand', 'trademark', 'rough', 'sex', 'imagery', 'decided', 'omit', 'entirely', 'book', 'smoldering', 'passion', 'Hank', 'Dagny', 'Rand', 'love', 'scenes', 'near', 'rape', 'movie', 'very', 'little', 'sexual', 'chemistry', 'characters', 'when', 'finally', 'consumate', 'relationship', 'scene', 'so', 'tepid', 'would', ""n't"", 'raise', 'eyebrows', 'ABC', 'School', 'Special', 'struck', 'Rand', 'were', 'alive', 'today', 'love', 'scene', 'might', 'be', 'biggest', 'possibly', 'only', 'complaint', 'movie.Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'movie', 'stand', 'own', 'just', 'makers', 'clearly', 'intend', 'make', 'three', 'expect', 'see', 'Luckily', 'expect', 'appear', 'video/Netflix', 'soon', ""'re"", 'released.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'Ayn', 'Rand', 'sycophant', 'think', 'had', 'important', 'things', 'say', 'believe', 'Atlas', 'Shrugged', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'decent', 'movie', 'modernizing', 'plot', 'shortening', 'something', 'appropriate', 'simple', 'straightforward', 'message', 'religious', 'devotion', 'book', 'makers', 'have', 'created', 'something', 'novelty', 'Definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'read', 'book', 'unlikely', 'be', 'world', 'shaking', 'clearly', 'hoped']",Atlas Shrugged: Part 1

The audiobook is quite a bit slower than the movie, so we have made slow progress.Although we somehow didn't realize that this movie was released, we were excited to find it on Amazon.  It seemed to closely parallel what we have been ""reading"" together.  Sometimes it seemed like parts were almost quoted out of the book.My husband and I both found this movie to be totally captivating.  We thought it was VERY well made.  The movie does a great job of taking something that seems kind of out-dated and making it very modern and very easy to relate to.  For instance, it's all about railroad lines, and nowadays, people don't actually care much about trains...but this movie does something special so that suddenly, as an audience, we find ourselves totally buying into the idea that trains could matter now.The actors in this movie are exceptional!  They all play their parts so well.  Dagny is beautiful, and strong, and such a great protagonist.  We really loved her.

I was never captured by Rand's mantra to begin with; it was the story that grabbed me from page one. Who is John Galt? Why are all these entrepreneurs disappearing?

1495149,A3CJIC7A4A7KJ2,B005N4DMMG,Gary Fisher,"[5, 9]","""Atlas Shrugged"" has been called one of the most influential books of the 20th Century, but was long considered an impossible story to film.  In a story almost as gripping as the book itself, a committed and dauntless team fought for years to bring Ayn Rand's timeless characters to the screen, and this satisfying production is the result.Rand's monumental book was published as a three-part story; the current film brings Part One to life; Part Two is already underway for a planned 2012 release, with Part Three to follow a year later.  Part One stands up well on its own, though of course like other multipart films (such as ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Star Wars"") the first part also sets the stage for much larger stories.  Further, as with Tolkien's or J.K. Rowling's epics, translation to film can never exactly match every reader's imagination; those who have read ""Atlas Shrugged"" will undoubtedly find characters, settings or situations in the film presented differently than they'd seen them in their mind's eye.  Nevertheless, the film does not stray from Rand's underlying story.  Because of this, it is not necessary to read the book prior to seeing the film, though after the film you'll almost certainly want to read the book.Most of the actors in ""Atlas Shrugged, Part One"", though skilled and believable, will be unfamiliar to moviegoers, but in many ways this is a benefit as it makes the parts they play seem more natural, free from the idiosyncrasies and typecasting with which we often subconsciously bind well-known actors.The production of ""Atlas Shrugged, Part One"" was fought at every turn by those who fear its message of individual freedom through personal responsibility; like Reardon Metal, what emerged from the fire is a thing of rare worth.

Even when these ideas are exactly the focus of the political debate currently going on in the US.Of course, a lot of movie-goers may have realized this, and rejected the movie because they reject the ideas of freedom, private property, hard work, and self-reliance.In any case, I found the movie refreshing, if only because it's the first movie concerned with ideas I've seen in fifty years or so, and also because I sympathize with the main characters and despise the villains (such as the happily-named Wesley Mouch).It seems like we're still trying to deal with JFK's idea: ""Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.""A good movie.

However, since this movie was in the works for a half century, the result is--a joke. I heard that there will be an attempt at a Part II--with a different cast! No. Pull the plug. Cut your losses now and start over again from scratch some day. The people responsible for this pitiful mediocrity are a bunch of Wesley Mouches and James Taggarts. They are INCOMPETENT IDIOTS. The producer seems like a nice guy (in his bonus feature ramble), by Objectivist standards, but he certainly should never have co-written the script. When I read last year that he was co-writing, I knew the project was in trouble. Let's face it: Even Ayn Rand would have been ashamed of this production. David Kelley as a consultant on the film should be ashamed. Get a little objectivity folks. Seen from beyond the borders of the Rand cult, Atlas Shrugged I is fourth-rate soaper.

The country is struggling from a collapsing infrastructure; unemployment is rampant; gas is $65 a gallon and the economy relies more and more on the rail system to move people as well as goods. Taggart Transcontinental Railways, run by the tough and smart Dagney Taggart is struggling to get the steel it needs to maintain and expand the railroads. Dagney partners with the enigmatic Hank Rearden to purchase a new kind of unproven steel, known as Rearden Steel, to expand one of her rail lines through Colorado.The government interferes more and more with industry, seizing assets and IP, controlling wages and production output. Capitalism is turning into socialism, and powerful, successful captains of industry are disappearing - walking away from their businesses, sometimes destroying those businesses beforehand. One of those men was John Galt, and Dagney coins the phrase ""Who is John Galt"" and names her new rail line ""The John Galt"" Line.Though much of the dialogue is as wooden as it was in the novel, the important roles are well cast with strong, believable performers, though none of the actors are A-List caliber. The sets and special effects are a peculiar mixture of ultra modern and vintage since the rail system hearkens back to a different era. This is a credible treatment of Ayn Rand's serious novel, which has been considered ""required reading"" for decades.

1495177,A1IU7S4HCK1XK0,B005N4DMMG,Joanna Daneman,"[1, 1]","I was hoping, from looking at preview clips, that this film would be a good interpretation of Ayn Rand's blockbuster novel. But low budget and perhaps a rush to production led to a less-than-optimum film. Here's my impression:1. As usual, the rule, ""if it's not on the page, it's not on the stage"" holds true. The script is lacking. Example: a scene with Dr. Stadler, the tragic, amoral genius of the State Science Institute and Dagny Taggart. Suddenly, in a discussion of the decision to condemn Readen Metal for political reasons rather than scientific, Stadler launches into a story about the three brilliant students he and another professor (Hugh Akston) shared. No explanation about why this was so germane to the discussion. A big ""HUH"" unless you'd read the novel. Hugh Akston (the noted philosopher and distinguished professor) here is interpreted as a hippy burnout. I don't think a philosopher who taught ""A is A"" and ""Everything is Something"" would be a hippy burnout. And no one is surprised he's running a diner; this would be surprising for the noted professor from Patrick Henry University, but not for a hippy burnout, so no surprise, no drama. Bad choice.2. Poor cinematography. While I applaud the way the low budget used stills of existing cities, rails, and other scenery, the vital expression of speed and excitement in the first run of the John Galt Line fell flat due to bad cinematography. The impression of speed just didn't happen; and a few well placed cameras or sped-up effects could have worked here. The long shots of the Colorado mountains decked with autumn aspens, shot from helicopter, just didn't work to convey the feeling of a speeding modern bullet train. And on that note, the cab of the engine of a bullet train CANNOT just have an armchair for the engineer and have a couple of people (Taggart and Rearden) standing behind in the mostly empty cab. HELLO! This train is supposedly speeding up to 250 mph. What about INERTIA? Anyone remember Newton's Laws of Motion? No.3. GREAT VILLAINS, flat heros. The villains are spot-on and the acting is good. Orren Boyle, the greasy, layabout steelmaker and Wesley Mouch, the Washington hack are cast well and their acting is good. You do need a good villain and here we have two excellent ones. Lillian Rearden is PERFECT. Her smarmy, sly sarcasm and bitterness are expressed with every twist of her lips.But the protagonists are all cardboard. They LOOK good (except for D'Anconia, who is a bad budget version of Banderas.) But Dagny's toughness is just a still severity, and the supposed fireworks when she and Rearden fall in love are absolutely as flat as a wet firecracker. Bah. ""I want to kiss you."" Right. That is hot. Really hot.The acting is not up to the mark, and that's the fault, I think, not only of the script, but more of the direction. Villany is easier--your role is defined (be bad, be evil.) But noble and good and heroic are harder. More motivation, color, conflicting emotions needed, and that's the job of the director to bring out (in the absence of better actors.)Summary: nice try but no cigar. The film IS true to the novel's premise, and the mixing in of current events (the recession) is chilling and adds to the production. But the poor script and acting and cinematography make this a second-rate film. It could have been so much better.",3,A shrug for Atlas Shrugged,1325721600,"01 5, 2012",2012,3351,"['was', 'hoping', 'looking', 'preview', 'clips', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'interpretation', 'Ayn', 'Rand', 'blockbuster', 'novel', 'low', 'budget', 'perhaps', 'rush', 'production', 'led', 'less-than-optimum', 'film', 'Here', 'impression:1', 'usual', 'rule', 'not', 'page', 'not', 'stage', 'true', 'script', 'lacking', 'Example', 'scene', 'Dr.', 'Stadler', 'tragic', 'amoral', 'genius', 'State', 'Science', 'Institute', 'Dagny', 'Taggart', 'Suddenly', 'discussion', 'decision', 'condemn', 'Readen', 'Metal', 'political', 'reasons', 'rather', 'scientific', 'Stadler', 'story', 'three', 'brilliant', 'students', 'professor', 'Hugh', 'Akston', 'shared', 'explanation', 'about', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'germane', 'discussion', 'big', 'HUH', ""'d"", 'read', 'novel', 'Hugh', 'Akston', 'noted', 'philosopher', 'distinguished', 'professor', 'here', 'interpreted', 'hippy', 'burnout', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'philosopher', 'who', 'taught', 'A', 'A', 'Everything', 'Something', 'would', 'be', 'hippy', 'burnout', 'one', 'surprised', 'running', 'diner', 'would', 'be', 'surprising', 'noted', 'professor', 'Patrick', 'Henry', 'University', 'not', 'hippy', 'burnout', 'surprise', 'drama', 'Bad', 'choice.2', 'Poor', 'cinematography', 'applaud', 'way', 'low', 'budget', 'used', 'stills', 'existing', 'cities', 'rails', 'other', 'scenery', 'vital', 'expression', 'speed', 'excitement', 'first', 'run', 'John', 'Galt', 'Line', 'fell', 'flat', 'due', 'bad', 'cinematography', 'impression', 'speed', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'few', 'well', 'placed', 'cameras', 'sped-up', 'effects', 'could', 'have', 'worked', 'here', 'long', 'shots', 'Colorado', 'mountains', 'decked', 'autumn', 'aspens', 'shot', 'helicopter', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'convey', 'feeling', 'speeding', 'modern', 'bullet', 'train', 'note', 'cab', 'engine', 'bullet', 'train', 'CAN', 'NOT', 'just', 'have', 'armchair', 'engineer', 'have', 'couple', 'people', 'Taggart', 'Rearden', 'standing', 'mostly', 'empty', 'cab', 'HELLO', 'train', 'supposedly', 'speeding', 'up', '250', 'mph', 'What', 'INERTIA', 'Anyone', 'remember', 'Newton', 'Laws', 'Motion', 'No.3', 'GREAT', 'VILLAINS', 'flat', 'heros', 'villains', 'are', 'spot-on', 'acting', 'good', 'Orren', 'Boyle', 'greasy', 'layabout', 'steelmaker', 'Wesley', 'Mouch', 'Washington', 'hack', 'are', 'cast', 'well', 'acting', 'good', 'do', 'need', 'good', 'villain', 'here', 'have', 'two', 'excellent', 'ones', 'Lillian', 'Rearden', 'PERFECT', 'smarmy', 'sly', 'sarcasm', 'bitterness', 'are', 'expressed', 'twist', 'lips.But', 'protagonists', 'are', 'cardboard', 'LOOK', 'good', ""D'Anconia"", 'who', 'bad', 'budget', 'version', 'Banderas', 'Dagny', 'toughness', 'just', 'still', 'severity', 'supposed', 'fireworks', 'when', 'Rearden', 'fall', 'love', 'are', 'absolutely', 'as', 'flat', 'wet', 'firecracker', 'Bah', 'want', 'kiss', 'Right', 'hot', 'Really', 'hot.The', 'acting', 'not', 'up', 'mark', 'fault', 'think', 'not', 'only', 'script', 'more', 'direction', 'Villany', 'easier', 'role', 'defined', 'be', 'bad', 'be', 'evil', 'noble', 'good', 'heroic', 'are', 'harder', 'More', 'motivation', 'color', 'conflicting', 'emotions', 'needed', 'job', 'director', 'bring', 'out', 'absence', 'better', 'actors', 'Summary', 'nice', 'try', 'cigar', 'film', 'IS', 'true', 'novel', 'premise', 'mixing', 'current', 'events', 'recession', 'chilling', 'production', 'poor', 'script', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'make', 'second-rate', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better']",Atlas Shrugged: Part 1

Could it be that this is the type of world they believe in where big government controls everything through the media and they don't want it to look bad? That's a possibility.

Trying to insert special ""techno effects"" like large industrial complexes and trains barrelling down futuristic landscapes and infrastructure was a waste.There should have been way more character development and scenes more akin to Bogart and Gable for the leading men.Some of the scenes seemed to be taken from a distance. More intimate filming would have been nice.Some of the actors gave noteworthy performances but the scenes seemed to be way too short to grasp anything from the dialogue.Maybe I just didn't get it, but I had to wait for the dvd to come out to see this movie and missed the big screen spectacle.  There wasn't one theater within 2,500 miles of Hawaii showing it when it was on the big screen. Part two is being passed on also by the Theaters in Hawaii.I might have enjoyed it a little better on the big screen but sometimes you have to make compromises.In any event the movie was a lot better than most of the movies Hollywood puts out. When you consider the budget restrictions it was a very good movie. There were no big named stars or sexy celebrities.Knowing that I have to wait for Part 2 to come out on dvd is a shame. Knowing that the cast is a whole new cast is very disturbing too.

1495190,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B005N4DMMG,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[17, 49]","I began reading Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged back in June and five months later I am on page 298, which leaves me with a measly 771 pages. At this rate I should finish the book by mid-2012. This 90-minute film is based on part one of her novel which stretches 312 pages and anyone who has opened the book will realize that each page, top-to-bottom with words and in very small font, has a bit more writing than the average page of a novel. Rand wrote the novel as a thinly-veiled allegory for her philosophy Objectivism, much of which has been embraced by libertarians and conservatives and has seen a recent surge in popularity. With no political or philosophical leanings, which seem to influence many critiques of her literary output, I began reading the novel solely for educational value and am close enough to finishing part 1 that I figured I might as well see the filmed version. Filmmakers have been trying to bring this to the screen for years and the finished product is an independent film made for $6 million with a no-name director and few familiar faces in the cast. With no real marketing budget, the film was heavily promoted by the Tea Party movement and grossed an impressive 1.6 million on only 300 screens it's opening weekend. Expanding to more screens the following week, the box-office numbers took a serious tumble and the film failed to make back its budget. In addition to the financial performance, the film received abysmal reviews with only one of seventeen top critics on Rotten Tomatoes giving it a positive notice. Holding a rotten 12%, one may be surprised to look to the right of the screen and see that 80% of audiences liked it. I immediately questioned the validity of the reviews, wondering if the dislike stemmed from personal feelings about Rand and her work rather than the product itself. I have no solid opinion about her philosophy or her novel, ergo I have no bias. Even so, Atlas Shrugged: Part 1 is quite underwhelming.The film begins on September 2, 2016 in a dystopian version of the United States that is in a sustained economic depression. A gas shortage has made prices rise to $37.50 per gallon and rail travel is now the only affordable means of transportation. This is good for Taggart Transcontinental CEO James Taggart (Matthew Marsden), except that a major accident on his Rio Norte line threatens the future of his company. His sister Dagny Taggart (Taylor Schilling), the Vice-President in Charge of Operation, is dissatisfied with her brother's handling of the issue and decides to replace the aging track with rails made by Rearden Metal. The credibility of the metal is the subject of controversy, but inventor Hank Rearden (Grant Bowler) insists that his metal is lighter and stronger than conventional steel. Dagny takes the gamble and the remainder of the film consists of nearly everyone, seen and unseen, trying to keep Rearden Metal from being used. Meanwhile, during many conversations that occur throughout the film, characters repeat the phrase ""Who is John Galt?"" A man, who is safely assumed to be John Galt, appears several times draped in shadow. People of merit have been mysteriously vanishing and the film makes it clear that they mysteriously vanish after speaking briefly with this shadowy figure. This way of incorporating the character could have made the film more ominous and mysterious but unfortunately just comes off as cheesy.The mediocrity of the production can be attributed to budget restraints, but the filmmakers must take responsibility for how they presented the material with limited means. With a six million dollar budget it's not ultra-cheap and classier films have been made with less. The truth of the matter is that those responsible for this film may have been too inexperienced for such an ambitious project. The musical score by Elia Cmiral and how it's used is the most irritating thing about Atlas Shrugged. The music itself may be fine, but rarely has a score been used so poorly that is actually cheapens the overall film. The score is so overbearing and overwrought, used needlessly in every establishing shot and nearly every scene, only getting worse as the film progresses. It's irritating at the beginning and grows to be inappropriate. Like someone performing stand-up comedy at a funeral, it just doesn't fit. I am unable to comment on his ability as a composer and I don't want to be the guy that slams him for his past work, but it's worth nothing that Cmiral has previously scored Wrong Turn, Battlefield Earth, and The Lost Boys: The Thirst. If he publicly admits to sabotaging the film, I would not bat an eyelash. For part 2 to be a success, either Cmiral or whoever responsible for displacing the score throughout the film needs to be fired.The cast consists of unknown actors and at least four character actors whose faces are more easily recognized than their names. These four; Michael Lerner, Jon Polito, Patrick Fischler, and Garham Beckel fare much better than those around them. The unknown actors that make up the principle cast all seem to have backgrounds in television, which may be to blame for their stiff, lifeless performances. Ironically, Matthew Marsden gives the stiffest performance and he actually has some film work behind him. Schilling makes a convincing Dagny, intelligent and beautiful without being too sexy. When it comes to the cold, calculating nature of the character she falters and her attempts to sell this attitude seem forced. Worse, some of the acting is straight from evening television with actors delivering their lines without thought or feeling, as if they're just reading them directly off the page.Atlas Shrugged: Part 1 feels like a made-for-TV movie, the Hallmark version of Rand's novel, complete with a sex scene that appears to be directly lifted from a Lifetime original movie. While it's not glaringly bad, it is thoroughly mediocre. It's not incompetent, just very amateurish and guilty of an obvious desire to look more refined than it can afford. It even has that faux-polished look typically reserved for television dramas. It's not that it too closely resembles a TV-movie, it's that it too closely resembles the worst of TV movies. The material is just presented in such a silly manner, with the camera angles, the music, the choppy editing, and the acting style all evoking sub-par material found on nighttime cable. It came as no surprise to me that director Paul Johansson's previous directorial credits include directing episodes of the television show One Tree Hill. In another shocking twist, the cinematographer Ross Berryman previously shot 28 episodes of Ugly Betty and 66 episodes of Angel. Even the lead actors Taylor Schilling and Grant Bowler immediately followed roles on television with this. Even when the film presents beautifully scenic images, they just seem superficial and generic, like framed pictures of blue skies and green trees you'd find hanging on the walls of a dental office.Putting aside any thoughts you have on Ayn Rand and her work, it's inarguable that Atlas Shrugged is an important piece of literature. This makes this adaptation even more frustrating, as it completely fails to capture the appropriate tone for an important philosophical novel of this stature. Some people consider Atlas Shrugged a ludicrous joke and the filmmakers almost seem to treat the material as such. Significant sections of the film play like a pretentious parody of the material and, even worse, it seems blissfully unaware of this. The heavy-handed has been rendered into a ham-handed film. The abrupt ending is especially laughable and it's inconceivable that they couldn't have made the transition between this and the next installment a bit smoother.The film doesn't stray too far from Rand's text with everything essential remaining and only minor characters and minor scenes omitted. It moves by quickly, a remarkable feat when one considers that the first part of the novel consists of boardroom meetings, train rides, more meetings, characters thinking about meetings, and endless discussions about Rearden Metal. Rand wrote in a very detailed, elaborate way and the fact that the filmmakers have seamlessly condensed this section of her opus into a 90-minute film that never feels dull is an achievement in and of itself. While it's hard to believe this film had a budget in the millions, there are moments that are impressive considering what little money the filmmakers had to work with. Some of the architectural aspects alone had to be daunting for such an independent production. Unfortunately, a larger budget and a more experienced crew would have done wonders for this film. A big studio would never fund this project though and it's doubtful that better marketing would make it a box-office hit, so this is probably the only adaptation we're likely to see.Atlas Shrugged: Part 1 is intriguing at best and embarrassing at worst. Those familiar with Rand will find her story present beneath the amateurish filmmaking, but how they'll respond to it I cannot say. I'd imagine that those drawn to see it will be readers of the novel who want to see this interpretation of the text and those interested in the novel but too lazy to read it. If you're reading this, you'll likely have already made a decision about whether to watch it. Some have loved it, some have hated it, and I fall somewhere in the middle, so do what you will. I am open to seeing the second and third installments, which the producers say will have a higher production budget. Hopefully the filmmaking team will learn from their mistakes and figure out how to properly use it.GRADE: C-",2,"2 1/2 Stars: Intriguing at Best, Embarrassing at Worst",1319932800,"10 30,

Just goes to show you should realize that so much of the world is so politicized, it's becoming impossible to get an objective (no pun intended, a la Rand's philosophy) opinion of what the movie is about.Having said that, I really liked this movie. I liked it so much, I'm going to reread 'Atlas Shrugged,' which I read years ago in college. And while I'll probably still skip over some of the long winded parts of Ayn Rand's commentary (the woman could write, but my God, did she EVER need an editor!!), this movie is so spot-on to what is wrong with this country, and the world, that the timing couldn't have been more perfect.Now to the technical details. I loved the casting. No one has made much of a mention of this, but I think Grant Bowler is perfect as Hank Reardon. His looks are perfect; he's also subtle. Taylor Schilling is fine as Dagney.The casting of the minor characters is really good as well. I particularly liked Patrick Fischler as Paul (very good cold blooded betrayal there), but I must admit, I adore Graham Beckel. He is absolutely perfect in his role.The cinematography in this movie is fantastic (a sure sign a reviewer didn't see this movie is when they criticize this!) The score is also perfect.In fact, the only criticism I have of 'Atlas Shrugged,' and it's a big one, is that the movie is WAY too short.

Russell,"[12, 14]","This movie is strangely refreshing to me because it is not a Hollywood production, it features no movie stars, it's incredibly well cast, and it's a good adaptation, no more and no less, of ATLAS SHRUGGED the novel, Part I.The preview gave me little inkling of how enjoyable the movie is. Taylor Schilling projects intensity simmering under self-control as Dagny Taggart, Grant Bowler projects both quiet strength and weary patience as Hank Rearden, and Jsu Garcia brings low-keyed charisma to his few scenes as Francisco d'Anconia. Graham Beckel is considerably older than Ellis Wyatt in the book, yet makes the role very much his own. Rebecca Wisocky absolutely nails Lillian Rearden. Matthew Marsden as James Taggart, Edi Gathegi as Eddie Willers, Jon Polito and Michael Lerner as Orren Boyle and Wesley Mouch--all are convincing in their roles and I want to see ALL of them in the same roles in Parts 2 and 3.I've left one star off my rating because the role of John Galt is overdone in this movie--not visually, but aurally. He looks good in diners, but he talks too much outside of them. To my mind he shouldn't talk at all in this part of the story. But I have no other quarrel with this movie.ATLAS SHRUGGED Part I does not pretend to be the same experience as the book, but follows the book closely enough to remind me of reading the novel many years ago. Back then, in the 1960s, I mentally cast Diana Rigg as Dagny and Patrick McGoohan as John Galt. Surprisingly, the first movie version hasn't spoiled that old dream, but rather given me a new experience of the story. I much prefer this production of ATLAS SHRUGGED to the 1940s Hollywood version of THE FOUNTAINHEAD, which was not as well cast and comes across as semi-hysterical.

The heroes of the story, Dagny Taggart and Hank Rearden, navigate a world with cell phones and cable news, but the story stays true to the novel. It tells the story from the opening to the disappearance of Ellis Wyatt, the Colorado oil man.Overall, I found this to be a very good movie.

I expected a movie totally enthralling, engaging, thrilling, etc., but by the end I just shrugged (in my mind at least) and wondered if there was going to be a part two (thankfully it looks like there will be).Taylor Schilling was a great Dagny, just as I envisioned the Dagny character in the novel to be (OK, I envisioned a brunette and the movie made her a blonde, but that's really not that important.)  But somehow the other characters weren't real to me at all.  There didn't seem to be chemistry, intensity, or something.  I don't even know enough movie critic lingo to describe what didn't work about this movie, but there's a certain ""there"" that great movies have that wasn't there with this movie (make sense?).Spoiler alert:To me the most memorable part of the movie was when Henry Reardon gave his wife a bracelet made out of the first pouring of Reardon Metal, and he was ridiculed by his wife and her friends for not giving her something conventional like a diamond.  I really felt for the guy.So, my advice is to try to see the movie without incuring any additional out-of-pocket expense.

Talented filmmakers are capable of making movies that live up to, and sometimes surpass the books (i.e To Kill a Mockingbird, Gone With the Wind, Apocalypse Now, Let the Right One In, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest).  So as an admirer of Atlas Shrugged, the book, I was cautiously optimistic about Atlas Shrugged Part One.  My optimism was only bolstered by the fact that the movie was made independently and without any big name Hollywood stars.To be fair, a lot about Atlas Shrugged Part One was done right.  The actors were well cast, particularly Grant Bowler as Rearden.  The atmosphere was pitch-perfect as the future dystopia.  What damaged the film were the narrative choices made by director Paul Johansson.  The script dragged, even for a viewer with as much patience and familiarity with the story as me.SPOILER:Worst of all, Johansson completely erodes the initial mystery that drives the story- Who is John Galt?  He answers the immortal question in the opening frame of the movie.  This is part 1, in the book Galt doesn't appear on stage until part 3.  Here we know from the very first scene that it is Galt persuading businessmen to quit and vanish.  By tipping its hand like that the movie loses its thrill.

The idea to take the story out of its original setting in the early 20th century and place it in the year 2016 was pure genius.But I do think some of the book's messages were a little cloudy in the movie, although things may become clearer in the sequels.

1495232,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B005N4DMMG,Mark Turner,"[2, 4]","Written in 1957, Ayn Rand's novel ATLAS SHRUGGED was a sensation. To this day the book continues to sell copies around the world and the late Rand has a group of followers to this day. So it would seem that this book would be easy to get made, right? Unfortunately no and the reasons why are as interesting as the book. Why would such a popular novel written so long ago take so long to be made? The producer of this film hints that it might possibly involve the politics of the film.The rights were purchase in 1992 and it's taken since then to get the film made. The themes involved are ones of individual achievement and recognition and the idea that they should be rewarded.  Here the government claims that things are being done to protect all when instead it's more about taking from one to help another, a government where the greater good of all comes before the individual, where redistribution of wealth is the goal of the government. Sound familiar?The year is 2016 and the world is in turmoil. The Middle East has taken to war with themselves and in the process cut off oil supplies. Limited oil means sky high gas prices (around $37 a gallon) and the most common mode of transportation of goods is via trains. The Taggart family has the biggest train system available with brother James (Matthew Marsden) at the helm. But the business is faltering due to his mismanagement. Failing to replace old rails and update the system the company is a PR nightmare. Enter sister Dagny (Taylor Schilling).Dagny has allied the company with Reardon Steel, a company headed by Henry Reardon (Grant Bowler). Reardon has come up with a new formula for steel that makes it lighter, more durable and cheaper. Dagny contracts his company to replace the rails in the oldest and most accident prone part of the company's rail system. Fighting her all the way is a group of old type steel owners and unions with ties to government lackeys who will do anything to prevent this from being a success.They first try to prevent this by planting stories about how unsafe the new steel is complete with studies presented by institutions who receive their funding from the government. They then change the laws to prevent one person owning more than one company, a slow way to take apart Reardon's conglomerate. But Dagny and Reardon press on. Will their endeavor succeed?While all of this is happening, major players in many companies are disappearing. One by one they just fall off the face of the Earth. But we viewers know something is up. Before each one disappears, a shadowy figure shows wearing a wide brim hat and asking for a moment of their time. And after they disappear the same phrase keeps appearing: Who is John Galt?There is so much story going on here that it's no wonder the entire book has been planned as a trilogy. This being part one we're introduced to the main characters and the situations that I'm sure will play out in parts two and three. But it doesn't feel like an incomplete film until the credits roll.Never having read the book (it was never assigned in class and I've not had the chance on my own yet) it will ignite an interest in it. This movie is well made and timely considering all that's happening in the world these days. Many catch phrases used seem to be taken from today's headlines as opposed to a book that's 54 years old.The production values of the film are superb. Great photography and direction only enhances actors who do a wonderful job. This is pretty amazing on it's own since none of the actors involved here could be called A listers or perhaps not even B list names. But each one turns in a performance that makes you believe they ARE the character being played.In a world where 24 hour news services play along constantly, each one seeking out their next headline story, this film just has a feeling of being important to see. Yes, it does take a one sided view of the world but then again don't all films? Perhaps the best thing to do is simply sit back, watch and see what you gather from the film on your own without prodding. As for me I found myself anxiously anticipating the next two parts. Let's hope they both appear soon.",4,POSSIBLE FUTURE?,1332201600,"03 20, 2012",2012,4174,"['Written', '1957', 'Ayn', 'Rand', 'novel', 'ATLAS', 'SHRUGGED', 'was', 'sensation', 'day', 'book', 'sell', 'copies', 'world', 'late', 'Rand', 'group', 'followers', 'day', 'would', 'seem', 'book', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'get', 'made', 'right', 'Unfortunately', 'reasons', 'why', 'are', 'as', 'interesting', 'book', 'Why', 'would', 'such', 'popular', 'novel', 'written', 'so', 'long', 'ago', 'take', 'so', 'long', 'be', 'made', 'producer', 'film', 'might', 'possibly', 'involve', 'politics', 'film.The', 'rights', 'were', 'purchase', '1992', 'taken', 'then', 'get', 'film', 'made', 'themes', 'involved', 'are', 'ones', 'individual', 'achievement', 'recognition', 'idea', 'should', 'be', 'rewarded', 'Here', 'government', 'things', 'are', 'being', 'done', 'protect', 'when', 'instead', 'more', 'taking', 'one', 'help', 'government', 'where', 'greater', 'good', 'individual', 'where', 'redistribution', 'wealth', 'goal', 'government', 'Sound', 'familiar', 'year', '2016', 'world', 'turmoil', 'Middle', 'East', 'taken', 'war', 'process', 'cut', 'off', 'oil', 'supplies', 'Limited', 'oil', 'sky', 'high', 'gas', 'prices', '37', 'gallon', 'most', 'common', 'mode', 'transportation', 'goods', 'trains', 'Taggart', 'family', 'biggest', 'train', 'system', 'available', 'brother', 'James', 'Matthew', 'Marsden', 'helm', 'business', 'faltering', 'due', 'mismanagement', 'Failing', 'replace', 'old', 'rails', 'update', 'system', 'company', 'PR', 'nightmare', 'Enter', 'sister', 'Dagny', 'Taylor', 'Schilling', '.Dagny', 'allied', 'company', 'Reardon', 'Steel', 'company', 'headed', 'Henry', 'Reardon', 'Grant', 'Bowler', 'Reardon', 'come', 'up', 'new', 'formula', 'steel', 'lighter', 'more', 'durable', 'cheaper', 'Dagny', 'contracts', 'company', 'replace', 'rails', 'oldest', 'most', 'accident', 'prone', 'part', 'company', 'rail', 'system', 'Fighting', 'way', 'group', 'old', 'type', 'steel', 'owners', 'unions', 'ties', 'government', 'lackeys', 'who', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'prevent', 'being', 'success.They', 'first', 'try', 'prevent', 'planting', 'stories', 'how', 'unsafe', 'new', 'steel', 'complete', 'studies', 'presented', 'institutions', 'who', 'receive', 'funding', 'government', 'then', 'change', 'laws', 'prevent', 'one', 'person', 'owning', 'more', 'one', 'company', 'slow', 'way', 'take', 'apart', 'Reardon', 'conglomerate', 'Dagny', 'Reardon', 'press', 'Will', 'endeavor', 'succeed', 'happening', 'major', 'players', 'many', 'companies', 'are', 'disappearing', 'One', 'one', 'just', 'fall', 'off', 'face', 'Earth', 'viewers', 'know', 'something', 'up', 'one', 'disappears', 'shadowy', 'figure', 'wearing', 'wide', 'brim', 'hat', 'asking', 'moment', 'time', 'disappear', 'same', 'phrase', 'appearing', 'Who', 'John', 'Galt', 'so', 'much', 'story', 'going', 'here', 'wonder', 'entire', 'book', 'been', 'planned', 'trilogy', 'being', 'part', 'one', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'main', 'characters', 'situations', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'play', 'out', 'parts', 'two', 'three', ""n't"", 'feel', 'incomplete', 'film', 'credits', 'roll.Never', 'having', 'read', 'book', 'was', 'never', 'assigned', 'class', ""'ve"", 'not', 'had', 'chance', 'own', 'yet', 'will', 'ignite', 'interest', 'movie', 'well', 'made', 'timely', 'considering', 'happening', 'world', 'days', 'Many', 'catch', 'phrases', 'used', 'seem', 'be', 'taken', 'today', 'headlines', 'opposed', 'book', '54', 'years', 'old.The', 'production', 'values', 'film', 'are', 'superb', 'Great', 'photography', 'direction', 'only', 'actors', 'who', 'do', 'wonderful', 'job', 'pretty', 'amazing', 'own', 'none', 'actors', 'involved', 'here', 'could', 'be', 'called', 'listers', 'perhaps', 'not', 'even', 'B', 'list', 'names', 'one', 'performance', 'believe', 'ARE', 'character', 'being', 'played.In', 'world', 'where', '24', 'hour', 'news', 'services', 'play', 'along', 'constantly', 'one', 'seeking', 'out', 'next', 'headline', 'story', 'film', 'just', 'feeling', 'being', 'important', 'see', 'Yes', 'take', 'one', 'sided', 'view', 'world', 'then', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'all', 'films', 'Perhaps', 'best', 'thing', 'do', 'simply', 'sit', 'back', 'watch', 'see', 'what', 'gather', 'film', 'own', 'prodding', 'found', 'anxiously', 'anticipating', 'next', 'two', 'parts', 'Let', 'hope', 'appear', 'soon']",Atlas Shrugged: Part 1

Second, I am huge movie fan.  Even though this adaptation of the first third of the massive novel has ""TV movie"" written all over it, what's wrong with that?  It appears to me as though virtually every penny of the budget made it up on to the screen, and you can't say that about most major Hollywood  movies.  The limited CGI effects were pretty decent, the score well done and effective, and the use of locations was inspired.Some reviewers have commented on the ""unfinished"" feeling this movie has.  That's to be expected, since it is only Part 1.  Parts 2 and 3 will be forthcoming, completing Rand's novel.  Having said that, modern film goers have been almost programmed into passively watching a movie as opposed to paying attention to dialogue.  This works against Atlas Shrugged, Part 1.  There is a lot of dialogue, and if you aren't listening carefully, you'll miss some important plot points.  Still, there isn't a wasted word in the piece.  And lines are delivered with skill and conviction.  You'll  have to be patient, though.  If you know the novel, large chunks of dialogue are missing.  If you don't know the novel, you'll be left hanging because many of the set pieces of Part 1 resume in Part 2 and even Part 3.  This is the downfall of any multi-part presentation; you have to come back for the pay offs and resolutions.There are some well-known character actors in Atlas Shrugged, Part 1; actors whose faces and voices you will recognize but whose names will escape you.  The principles, who were unknown to me, were very good in their interpretations of Rand's characters.  At least, I thought they were.If you are afraid of Ayn Rand's philosophy for whatever reason, try watching Atlas Shrugged, Part 1 for what it is.

All the characters were well portrayed and the actors for the most part were unknowns to me.  My only complaints were that it didn't take place in the 1950s when the book was written.  The time is 2016.  I think it would've been great if the producers would've done it in the same period  to make it more authentic.  I also wish they could've done part 1 and part 2 at the same time.  There is a whole different cast in part 2 and it was made two years after this film.  Why was that?Another problem with the movie was that it really didn't delve into the background of the major characters, mainly Dagny Taggart, Henry Reardon, and Francisco D'arcania.  Francisco is portrayed mainly as a playboy and someone lacking talent and responsibility, yet in the book there is a lot of great insights coming from Francisco.  Even Henry Reardon's character is much more complex in the book--very driven, focused, without a lot of emotion.  His feelings emerge slowly and his passions are brought out much later.I feel this could've been a much better film and it should have been done in two parts with the same actors.  On the positive side, the filming and cinematography was well done.  The city scenes were dark and showed the characters in an almost stark environment. The train scenes were very picturesque and really brings out how the two characters Dagny Taggart and Hank Reardon come alive on the railway as they experience their first collaboration of Reardon's metals and Dagny's John Gault Line.

Airline travel is restricted due to fuel shortages and prices. Travel by automobile is economically unfeasible for long trips. The last remaining avenue for travel is via railroads, which are struggling due to fuel shortages, the poor conditions of tracks, and a lack parts for locomotives & rolling stock.There are two groups of people in this film: the producers and the looters.  The ""producers (e.g., Ellis Wyatt, Dagney Taggert, & Hank Rearden)"" are brilliant people who are merely trying provide high-quality products or services using their own time, talent, & sheer grit; then there are the looters.

But I heard the chatter about the movie project so I read it for the first time -- within the last 12 months, actually.I am a disciple, a true believer...I always found myself in alignment with John Galt, but just never had anything to relate my own philosophies to.  I've read Milton Friedman in high school for class.  I was a young Reaganite in 1980-1, wearing the campaign buttons to school, almost to the point of fanaticism.  I have never wavered in that believe that man is responsible for himself and must not be condemned to live in slavery to another, even if those bonds are ""virtual"" or economic.So I read the book.  The parallels it draws to modern day is chilling.  Many of the things which occurred in the book/movie are those things which I've heard our National Socialists in Washington chime in on, but with a different name.  State control of the sciences, State regulation of railroad traffic, institutionalizing ""fairness"" at the expense of freedom.  Special taxes to confiscate wealth from the better off regions (does Obama's punishment of Texas somehow equate to Wesley Mouch's punishment of Colorado?  The loathing is plainly obvious.) disdain for oil production,  shipping our resources and money to other ""People's Republics"" at the expense of our own economy and citizenry.I was expecting a wide variation in content between book and movie, but was pleasantly surprised how closely some of the scenes followed.  I can't wait until part II when many of the confrontations take place between the main characters, it will be riveting.Come on....get the disc pressing done and let's get it in our hands!

You do this, by giving them an interesting character, that's put into an interesting scenario.  Now, having read the book, these are some very interesting characters, but the writer, and director failed at pulling me into the story.  I wasn't interested in what was going on.

I am disclosing this because I will not be comparing her book(s) with this movie.  Film is made with the cast of the virtually unknown actors.  It is part one (1) of three (3).  I initially planned to see it in the movie theatres but the rmovie run was fairly short - I giess not enough interest, or poor marketing, however you wish to look at it.  Finally, I got to watch it on DVD.  Two main characters are independently wealthy people with zest for life and unbendable will.  They are determined to make a world a better place and for that idea are willing to join forces and fight the ""establishment"". It is a mix of ideal persons who have strong desire to be successful without compromising their moral beliefs (which we are supposed to believe are good and mean no hurt to anyone).I do not know what to think about the film.  It is a love story between two intelligent people. They make their own rules along the way in this story.  They are not necessarily altruistic - their (mutual) goal is to be rich stay rich, and of course find a way to be even more rich.  The first part made me lukewarm. but I will give it a chance and see the entire trilogy.

As I write this, part two is showing in theatres and part three has a scheduled release date of July 4, 2014.A final note is that I don't agree with all aspects of Rand's philosophy, and I think that capatalism in it's purist form, as espoused by Rand, doesn't work in a world of finite resources.

Of course like all books put into film form it misses some of the impact that can be conveyed with filling in the details and using your own imagination.

1495288,A2TOXBTDH3Y6R9,B005N4DMMG,Rich H.,"[7, 10]","For those of you who have never read Atlas Shrugged:This is a pretty good adaptation of the first third of Ayn Rand's masterwork.  That's saying a lot, because Atlas Shrugged the book is a huge, incredibly dense and verbose novel that many people have tried and failed to film over the past half-century. John Aglialoro and Harmon Kaslow not only succeeded in bringing (part of) it to the screen, but kept it reasonably faithful to the book AND did it all on a tiny budget by Hollywood standards.  (And it now appears we'll be seeing parts 2 and 3 in 2012 and 2013 - more on this later.)Now, that said: If you haven't read the book, Part One is not going to impress you.  The first part of the novel (which is, not coincidentally, written in three parts) is almost all character development and foreshadowing, and the movie is pretty much the same.  We get to know one Dagny Taggart, railroad executive in a world where gas prices have skyrocketed and rail transport is once again vital to commerce, and Hank Rearden, steel magnate who has just started to commercialize a new super-alloy that promises to revolutionize the industry.  Taggart, Rearden, and a number of other industry leaders we meet in the course of the movie are overachievers; supremely competent, dedicated and successful, and just beginning to struggle to remain so in a society that is growing increasingly hostile toward the ""fortunate few,"" moving ever more rapidly toward outright class warfare.  (Sound familiar?)  They are also puzzled and growing alarmed that, over the course of the movie, their colleagues are going missing, one by one.  Their wealth is either disappearing with them or being destroyed, apparently by their own hands.  We also see hints of a shadowy figure who is somehow involved with these disappearances.That's pretty much it.  There are some decent dramatic moments, well-detailed sets, a good, understated soundtrack, and a CGI-heavy sequence of the first run of a new, beyond-state-of-the-art rail line that is amazingly good given the bargain-basement budget, but the plot is almost entirely about establishing the good guys and bad guys, and laying the groundwork for the stark divide between the Makers and Takers that will hit the fan in parts 2 and 3.  If you've read the book, this is a nice setup.  If you haven't, it's... well... dull.And you should watch it anyway.  Why?  Because if Aglialoro and Kaslow continue to stay close to the novel (and there's no reason to think that they won't,) the action will pick up dramatically in parts 2 and 3, and you'll need the exposition in part 1 to make sense of the rest.(Yes, having to follow a story in three widely-separated chunks is annoying.  Trust me on this, however, there is absolutely no way this novel could have been squeezed into a standard 2-1/2 hour movie.  It's been tried before with other epic works, and the results have been uniformly awful.  Kudos to the producers for insisting on doing this one the right way.)So, watch part 1 now, or wait until 2 and 3 are out and do a five-hour marathon. Either way it should be worth your while.Now, for those of you familiar with the book:Atlas Shrugged The Movie, part one at least, isn't half bad.  Stripped to its bare essentials, the story moves right along, focusing on Dagny, Hank and, interestingly enough, Ellis Wyatt as they struggle against the growing collectivist tide and the gradual disappearance of their industrial colleagues.  It isn't perfect, it is in fact a long way from perfection, but it's amazing what the producers have done with a small fraction of what should rightly have been a $60-80 million budget.  The sets are lavish, the setting is 21st-century believable, and the rebuilding and inaugural run of the John Galt Line is impressive as hell - you'd swear that they blew the budget for the entire picture on this one sequence alone.It is still, however, a low-budget picture, and it shows.  The acting isn't impressive, although Graham Beckel's splendid Ellis Wyatt makes up for a lot of that.  The writing is OK, better than the book (ducking :) ) but uninspired. Best example: Dagny and Hank's discovery of Galt's prototype motor is accompanied by the most horrific techno-babble put to film since ""Plan 9 from Outer Space""... ""atmospheric vacuum!?""  Aglialoro actually boiled the novel down a little too far (no small irony here;) the movie is stock-footage-heavy even at 109 minutes run time.  It would have been nice to see a little more of the political gaming going on behind the scenes, especially in re the mind-set that led to the Anti-Dog-Eat-Dog and Equalization of Opportunity laws.  It also would have been nice to have had a few added scenes to humanize the protagonists who, let's face it, come off in the movie every bit as one-dimensional and stuck-up as they do in the novel.  Sum of topic: fewer stock shots and more scenes to help us get into the good and bad guys' heads in a perhaps 120-minute film might have made for a more interesting movie.At any rate, Part Two is due in October... six months behind schedule, with an entirely new cast and director since they apparently didn't bother to option the part 1 cast for the remaining two movies.  Bizarre and amateurish; it's surprising that Part Two was ever made.  The producers claim that Part Three has already been greenlighted for a 2013 release, but given the turmoil behind the scenes it's anyone's guess if and when.  (Then again, given its history, it's a minor miracle that Atlas Shrugged has made it to film at all.)  I'm going to remain optimistic that all these changes will give Atlas Shrugged The Movie a somewhat-needed kick in the pants, and look forward to a rewarding parts 2 and 3.Bottom line: Watch it, but don't expect more than what it is (A is A - heh): a set-up for the meat of the story in parts 2 and 3.  Four stars - five for the production itself, minus one for the mediocre acting and the over-compressed screenplay.",4,Surprisingly good work by a motley production company,1344124800,"08 5,

Rand's peon to her self-named philosophy of ""objectivism"" has been translated into more than a dozen languages including Mongolian.  It remains a constant seller.Rand's overt themes, endlessly expressed in the words and actions of her characters -- rejection of God, altruism and any moral code -- shifted her identity in the public mind from the popular fiction writer of THE FOUNTAIN HEAD to contemporary philosopher.True believers of Rand's philosophy embraced the movie that covers about the first third of her epic novel.  But average moviegoers and critics were united in their disdain -- which I share.This low-budget vanity production is lacking in the things that make movies work.  When a story has an agenda beyond entertainment, it starts to spiral into a morass of ennui and boredom.  One person told me that she thought the global economic mess we find ourselves combating is a result of thinking like Rand where selfishness and greed are praised as true expressions of freedom.And now word is the production company is recalling the original packaging that reads: ""AYN RAND's timeless novel of courage and self-sacrifice comes to life...""Producer Harmon Kaslow,  top dog at Atlas Productions said: ""As we all well know, the ideas brought to life in Atlas Shrugged are entirely antithetical to the idea of `self-sacrifice' as a virtue. Atlas is quite literally a story about the dangers of self-sacrifice. The error was an unfortunate one and fans of Ayn Rand and Atlas have every right to be upset... and we have every intention of making it right.""So it appears that the new DVD and BD cover will state: ""AYN RAND's timeless novel of rational self-interest comes to life...""It might be noted here that Rand, a heavy smoker, thought anti-smoking warnings were a communist plot.  She underwent surgery for lung cancer in 1974 and died of heart failure on March 16, 1982.  Her books have had a recent resurgence in popularity.  Even so, the movie adaptation of ATLAS SHRUGGED - the first episode of a proposed trilogy -- remains a dud.The recent capture and killing of Ghadaffi reminded me of what can happen when one pursues a philosophy of ""Objectivism.""  He died with assets of over $200 billion and ended up on display in a meat locker.  Imagine if he had actually served his people and made life better for all in his oil rich country.

1495302,A387BD735MI50R,B005N4DMMG,R. Schultz,"[2, 6]","The movie itself has a comic book tone. There are villains and heroes. The heroes border on being super-heroes. The plot deals in simplistic superlatives. An industrialist has invented ""the best"" metal ever conceived, a metal whose production could put the catastrophically flagging U.S. economy back on track. But sinister government officials who put the goal of equalizing opportunity and people above sheer individual achievement - conspire to undermine the industrialist's business.If this movie had in fact been presented as a Disney animated feature, it would have paradoxically been more believable. It would have clearly removed the action to a more mythic realm where titans properly reside. However, having chosen to shoot this film as realism, the producers force their flesh-and-blood actors to move jarringly like stick figure representations of ideas through a naturalistic landscape. The humans are forced to become stereotypes. The heroes are mostly young, attractive, or at least compellingly virile. The villains are older, often bald and paunchy. The one Hispanic character has a shock of incredible dark hair flowing low on his face, the worst hair-do since that of Javier Bardem's in ""No Country for Old Men."" The only African-American actor in the film comes on screen almost as a token in a subordinate role.George Orwell's book ""Animal Farm"" had some themes similar to those of ""Atlas Shrugged."" It taught that tyranny so easily follows in the wake of ""good intentions"" to equalize everybody. However, when Orwell's book was translated to the screen, the producers rightly chose animation as their medium. That probably wasn't only because the Farm involves so many talking animals. The producers might have realized that parable is more appropriated presented in the abstract.This movie closely follows Ayn Rand's 1957 novel, only updating the technology available to the characters where absolutely necessary. I admired a great deal of Rand's philosophy, but was usually only able to appreciate her ideas when she presented them directly, speaking in her own voice. When she tried to hang her ideas onto the figures in her fictions, they tended to clank stiffly like coats of armor. In short, I found her novels unreadable.I started reading ""Atlas Shrugged"" years ago, but couldn't get through its monolithic landscape. The characters and their conversations seemed like concrete abutments. So I never got to find out the answer to the prevailing question in the novel - ""Who is John Galt.""I hoped this movie would answer that question. But I was frustrated again. This movie is only Part I of a projected trilogy. Part II isn't scheduled to come out for another year. And who knows about Part III. All of which presents another problem. With such a long time between the releases of the sections of this work, how will the producers get the audiences caught up when Parts II and III do appear? There will be the need for some tedious back-pedaling and re-capping. So it might be better to wait to see this when (and if) ""Atlas Shrugged"" becomes available in its cinematic entirety.As it is, this film just leaves you hanging. Its concluding scene is inexplicable, or subject to misinterpretation, unless you listen carefully to the producer's explanation in the DVD's bonus features.Those bonus features are generally very worthwhile though. If I give the film itself only 3 stars, I give the bonus features 5 stars (averaging out to the overall 4-rating for the DVD). The extras consist - first, of a serious and intelligent director/producer commentary which includes some interesting appreciation of Ayn Rand's ideas.Next, when the producers were forced to distribute this film as an independent production, they invited supporters to send in videos of themselves announcing ""I am John Galt."" They show the results. I can't quite say the faces make an American panorama. There are more men than women, and few members of any minority group. I thought I'd get tired of this long segment. Nevertheless, the cavalcade of human faces is fascinating, with each person giving his or her unique inflection to that simple sentence.The commentators suggest that this movie should inspire you to read the novel.

1495303,A3RKH1XZ23827J,B005N4DMMG,"R. Stane ""Sunshine""","[6, 14]","This story is about the ideal of Capitalism.  Novelist, Ayn Rand was known for this.  The heros of society are the hard working, innovative industrialists.  They are the ones who create the inventions that improve the standard of living for all.  And yet, the majority is ungrateful and try to take away the wealth of these creators by government controls.  This is the plot and theme of Atlas Shrugged.Ayn was born, educated and raised in Russia.  She saw the evils of Marxism and how the creators in society were not rewarded, but rather punished by the government and the collective state.  However, Ayn brought with her the Marxist ideas that religion was the opium of the people.  As we look at the results of atheistic states like Russia and China, we see a total lack of human rights, followed by 100 million dying in death camps.So it is very odd to embrace capitalism, but reject the altuistic teachings of Jesus. Capitalism w/o Jesus is also evil and leads to slavery or forced 12 hour day, 6 day a week work schedules. Consider Scrooge or old man Potter from It's a Wonderful Life as good examples.In Ayn's perspective, the industrialists are the heroes and the people are the mob of thugs. But from God's view, all are made by God in His image. Each person is important. Thus in America, ""All men are endowed by their Creator, with...rights."" Thus, we have a ""Bill of Rights"" in our Constitution. Jesus would want us to be creative, work hard, prosper and be generous. In contrast, Ayn Rand wrote another book entitled, ""The Virtue of Selfishness."" This is an oxymoron. It is like saying the virtue of adultery!Thus, I am addressing Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged and her philosophy behind her novel.I think Capitalism is the best form of economy in that it creates an ever higher standard of living for the most amount of people. I love my Dell Computer and Microsoft Operating system, my Dakota 4WD pick up, my AOC flat screen HD TV, my Martin Guitar, my Levi jeans, my Cabela explorer shirts, Southwest Airlines, Hallmark and Disney movies, Marie Callendars and Starbucks coffee...and a million other fine businesses...Here in America, we have more people that identify themselves as Christians, than any other country on earth. This is why we have the maximum amount of individual freedoms, the greatest amount of innovations and the most generosity of any other nation. But Capitalism w/o Jesus is more like the people that cheat the system and produce nothing, like Wall Street's Gordon Gekko or George Soros or Al Gore or Michael Moore.",3,"Capitalism, w/o Jesus",1321315200,"11 15, 2011",2011,2550,"['story', 'ideal', 'Capitalism', 'Novelist', 'Ayn', 'Rand', 'was', 'known', 'heros', 'society', 'are', 'hard', 'working', 'innovative', 'industrialists', 'are', 'ones', 'who', 'create', 'inventions', 'improve', 'standard', 'living', 'yet', 'majority', 'ungrateful', 'try', 'take', 'away', 'wealth', 'creators', 'government', 'controls', 'plot', 'theme', 'Atlas', 'Shrugged.Ayn', 'was', 'born', 'educated', 'raised', 'Russia', 'saw', 'evils', 'Marxism', 'how', 'creators', 'society', 'were', 'not', 'rewarded', 'rather', 'punished', 'government', 'collective', 'state', 'However', 'Ayn', 'brought', 'Marxist', 'ideas', 'religion', 'was', 'opium', 'people', 'look', 'results', 'atheistic', 'states', 'Russia', 'China', 'see', 'total', 'lack', 'human', 'rights', 'followed', '100', 'million', 'dying', 'death', 'camps.So', 'very', 'odd', 'embrace', 'capitalism', 'reject', 'altuistic', 'teachings', 'Jesus', 'Capitalism', 'w/o', 'Jesus', 'also', 'evil', 'slavery', 'forced', '12', 'hour', 'day', '6', 'day', 'week', 'work', 'schedules', 'Consider', 'Scrooge', 'old', 'man', 'Potter', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'good', 'examples.In', 'Ayn', 'perspective', 'industrialists', 'are', 'heroes', 'people', 'are', 'mob', 'thugs', 'God', 'view', 'are', 'made', 'God', 'image', 'person', 'important', 'Thus', 'America', 'men', 'are', 'endowed', 'Creator', 'rights', 'Thus', 'have', 'Bill', 'Rights', 'Constitution', 'Jesus', 'would', 'want', 'be', 'creative', 'work', 'hard', 'prosper', 'be', 'generous', 'contrast', 'Ayn', 'Rand', 'wrote', 'book', 'entitled', 'Virtue', 'Selfishness', 'oxymoron', 'saying', 'virtue', 'adultery', 'Thus', 'am', 'addressing', 'Ayn', 'Rand', 'Atlas', 'Shrugged', 'philosophy', 'novel.I', 'think', 'Capitalism', 'best', 'form', 'economy', 'ever', 'higher', 'standard', 'living', 'most', 'amount', 'people', 'love', 'Dell', 'Computer', 'Microsoft', 'Operating', 'system', 'Dakota', '4WD', 'pick', 'up', 'AOC', 'flat', 'screen', 'HD', 'TV', 'Martin', 'Guitar', 'Levi', 'jeans', 'Cabela', 'explorer', 'shirts', 'Southwest', 'Airlines', 'Hallmark', 'Disney', 'movies', 'Marie', 'Callendars', 'Starbucks', 'coffee', 'million', 'other', 'fine', 'businesses', 'Here', 'America', 'have', 'more', 'people', 'identify', 'Christians', 'other', 'country', 'earth', 'why', 'have', 'maximum', 'amount', 'individual', 'freedoms', 'greatest', 'amount', 'innovations', 'most', 'generosity', 'other', 'nation', 'Capitalism', 'w/o', 'Jesus', 'more', 'people', 'cheat', 'system', 'produce', 'nothing', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Gordon', 'Gekko', 'George', 'Soros', 'Al', 'Gore', 'Michael', 'Moore']",Atlas Shrugged: Part 1

It delves into the mind set of two philosophies, liberalism, and capitalism.  One wants to take everything and make it an even playing field thus draining the reservoir of ideas, innovation, and individualism.  The other, Capitalism, wants to fill the reservoir through the very things that liberalism strives to regulate and control out of existence.  Ronald Reagan once said, Liberals believe that if it moves, tax it, if it keeps moving regulate it, and if it stops moving, subsidize it.  This movie portrays how one philosophy leads to economic ruin through the stagnation of bureaucratic red tape and political correctness while the other, capitalism, through innovation, can bring about a second renaissance, an economic boom that will lift everyone up in its wake as opposed to dragging them down with mediocrity and the ideals embraced by liberalism.  One can conclude that liberalism is about those in power staying in power by keeping everyone else down while manipulating the masses into believing that they aren't to blame for the poverty they have caused.  That capitalism is to blame and therefore is evil and must be regulated, legislated, and controlled.  They hide the fact that their religion is hypocrisy and denial.  That capitalism is the driving force behind the engine of innovation and it is that engine of innovation that propels economic prosperity and individual success, growth and expansion.  That through capitalism people are inspired to thrive and it is that drive to do better that brings everyone up.  Through liberalism however, innovation is starved because capitalism is strangled through regulation, legislation, and corruption thus eliminating the very fuel that drives the economic engine and therefore brings everyone down say for those who are in power.

Based on the producers complete lack of understanding of Rand and her philosophy.Just to be clear, Rand was most certainly not a fan of ""self-sacrifice"" - although I believe she would have said that if you love someone, and choose to give to them even if it means you have less...well that is no sacrifice. It speaks to the core of value achievement on this earth...but the fact that the producers of this film thought that self-sacrifice was the theme...um...until they were corrected...well...that says it all to me...I am not quite sure what is scarier, the hatred directed at the novel for which this movie is based by people who have never read it, or the slathering, ridiculously positive reviews for what is such a poor attempt at bringing it to the screen.In fact, Producer Aglialoro presented Rand's detractors with the ultimate gift...finally...an example that her characters truly are ""wooden"", with dialogue and story to boot. Many who see this film first, will never touch Ayn Rand's books.Ayn Rand herself thought that if a movie version of Atlas was terrible, it would ""ruin her"". That's a fact. Well...this film and people like Paul Ryan, Rand Paul and other supposed Rand fans, who stand in stark opposition to her actual views...are most certainly assisting in the process.Now please allow me to quote Ebert on this mess of a film:""So OK. Let's say you know the novel, you agree with Ayn Rand, you're an objectivist or a libertarian, and you've been waiting eagerly for this movie. Man, are you going to get a letdown. It's not enough that a movie agree with you, in however an incoherent and murky fashion. It would help if it were like, you know, entertaining?""I had the misfortune to sit through this film at the premiere...and to see many of Rand's detractors invited and present at the cocktail party and screening itself...David Kelley...Nathaniel Branden...and others who have spent years both expropriating and living off of her works, reputation and ideas while taking every given opportunity to excoriate her. I was not pleased.The film itself is what you would expect from a man who even I was warned twenty years ago, ""didn't understand Rand's ideas"" by an associate of Peikoff's (Rand's heir). It misses the heroic spirit and representation of her values/ideas almost completely while maintaining their hollow shape to those taking a glance. Like that f-ing tree Willers was so upset about (for those who have read the book).Our heroic individualist producer says of the 3rd film coming out soon, that he is looking to make this version ""something closer to the book."" What does that presuppose exactly? The second movie, Aglialoro says, was rushed so that it would be ready by October 2012, before Election Day.""What a momo. Can you imagine Rand rushing her work to be ready for election day?On how he doesn't care about making money with this movie...""I never thought the financials would be this bad, but it's not strictly a business transaction. This is the business of the heart."" - it certainly is.Aglialoro on Rand's liberal views: ""I'd like to speak to the MSNBC crowd,"" he said. ""So much of what Ayn Rand believed was liberal -- gay rights, and she thought the drug policy was a total disaster. She hated the Vietnam War.""Look, I loved Rand's work. But her personal opinions on many things, including gays take much to be desired - and despite the fact that many in her inner circle were gay (including her brother-in-law)...well...I believe her exact words were that she thought that the behavior was ""immoral"" and ""dizgusting"" (russian accent). Although certainly she did not think it should be illegal.So perhaps Johnny wants to reconsider how to sell Rand to the ""left"". :)At one point, Aglialoro claimed that he would not make a 2nd and 3rd film (thank god) and blamed Roger Ebert among others for its failure, for which Ebert replied ""Atlas Shrugged producer cancels Parts 2 and 3, blames critics, not his own lousy film."" lolAnd while I disagree with Ebert's views on Rand, had this film been great - as it could have been - his comments would have been irrelevant. Or perhaps begrudgingly positive. Ebert was bang on when he said, ""I suspect only someone very familiar with Rand's 1957 novel could understand the film at all, and I doubt they will be happy with it.""At the premier of the 2nd film, Aglialoro defended Rand's views based on what was best for the common good. I heard it and so did the people from ARI sitting near me - who seemed to be taking notes.All in all, the 2 films I have seen so far were the result of mediocrity in action, and did come off like an 80's spoof of Dallas, except without heavyweight Hagman to carry anything.The way to do this film properly, was to make an animated mini series...preferably with someone whose spirit matched

1495320,A1RVBEAD8RKDT8,B005N4DMMG,SpirituallySpeaking,"[0, 1]","The differing of opinions is so interesting.  The critics hammered this movie mercilessly, but it was much better than I expected.  The movie, production quality and performances are all terrific, especially the actors playing Rearden and Dagney Taggart.  What's more difficult to process is the film's message.In a nutshell, the film proposes that it's really only the ""successful"" people that make the world go 'round.  They improve the quality of life on earth.  They pay for the infrastructure.  They provide the jobs for the masses through their companies.  They push technological advancement, etc.  The rest of the 99.9999% of the world's population are just ""takers""; a drag on the wheel of progress that don't really contribute anything.  It's because of the entitlement attitude of all these people and their cronies in government and special interest groups, that the corporate executives lose their freedoms through federal business over-regulation.  As a result, the gifted businessmen, scientists, engineers, etc. leave the country, causing society's infrastructure to collapse without their genius and financial contributions.I completely understand how government today takes a socialist approach to business and stifles economic freedoms and development through over-regulation.  Even as a liberal, I don't agree that someone's income should be seized and redistributed to the less fortunate, if that income was made fairly and honestly...no matter HOW huge the profit is.  I also recognize the benefit of corporations and the enormous philanthropic donations they make to the programs that serve the masses.Having said that, I had to roll my eyes several times at the audacious implication by several of the characters, that billionaire corporate executives are the ""real"" victims.  I'm sorry.  I just can't feel sorry for someone who lost $1 billion in a stock market downturn that still has $49 billion in the bank!  It's laughable that these people are made out to be the ""damsels in distress"" of this story.  I do understand what Rand is trying to say and agree with much of her theory.Still, it's VERY simplistic to make corporations out to be the victims in this story, as lily white do-gooders.  We ALL know that's just NOT true.  Enron, anyone?  Rand wrote this novel 60+ years before CEOs raided employee IRA accounts, mass layoffs, manufacturing was sent to China & Mexico and the mortgage fraud tragedy.  She doesn't even imply in her story that most of these corporations that she deems so saintly are polluting the environment on a colossal scale through mercury dumps in the ocean, oil spills, etc. Is that really helping to hold the world up and improve society?I CRINGED when Rearden, even as a likeable character, said to Dagney, ""WE'RE the ones who really matter"" [in the world].  Ugh.  Really?  As humans, we forget that money wasn't always with us.  WE CREATED money.  Life can go on just fine without it.  Before money...who was it that REALLY mattered?  Let's see.  It was the farmers, tailors, home builders, innkeepers, blacksmiths, bakers, medicine man, etc.  It was the people who had tangible skills that could meet the most important necessities of life, NOT 21st Century corporate autocrats that just push paper around a desk and move computer blips across a screen to make more money.  How does THAT make the world a better place?  How does THAT make them matter more?  I think not.  They provide no REAL, tangible service to the world.  Let's not forget the artists, poets, singers, composers, dancers and painters who have enriched the world's soul in ways what are simply incalculable in their value.  What do corporate heads REALLY provide, directly from their own hands, that really contribute to society?  If all the money disappeared from the earth tomorrow, what would they have to trade or share to create their way in the world?  Nothing.  It's the 99% that are truly the ""salt of the earth"".So, let's keep all this in perspective.  Rand takes a VERY black and white approach...and may I say, a very dated one.  That's why I ended up feeling conflicted.  I understand the need for corporate freedom in our society and government corruption should be rooted out at all levels...but so should corporate corruption.  We also need to remember that it's people that make this world great, NOT companies...because what are companies, but groups of people anyway?",4,Well Done But Leaves Viewers with Emotions as Conflicting as It's Message,1357516800,"01 7, 2013",2013,4414,"['differing', 'opinions', 'so', 'interesting', 'critics', 'hammered', 'movie', 'mercilessly', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'expected', 'movie', 'production', 'quality', 'performances', 'are', 'terrific', 'especially', 'actors', 'playing', 'Rearden', 'Dagney', 'Taggart', 'What', 'more', 'difficult', 'process', 'film', 'message.In', 'nutshell', 'film', 'really', 'only', 'successful', 'people', 'make', 'world', 'go', 'improve', 'quality', 'life', 'earth', 'pay', 'infrastructure', 'provide', 'jobs', 'masses', 'companies', 'push', 'technological', 'advancement', 'etc', 'rest', '99.9999', '%', 'world', 'population', 'are', 'just', 'takers', 'drag', 'wheel', 'progress', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'contribute', 'anything', 'entitlement', 'attitude', 'people', 'cronies', 'government', 'special', 'interest', 'groups', 'corporate', 'executives', 'lose', 'freedoms', 'federal', 'business', 'over-regulation', 'result', 'gifted', 'businessmen', 'scientists', 'engineers', 'etc', 'leave', 'country', 'causing', 'society', 'infrastructure', 'collapse', 'genius', 'financial', 'contributions.I', 'completely', 'understand', 'how', 'government', 'today', 'socialist', 'approach', 'business', 'stifles', 'economic', 'freedoms', 'development', 'over-regulation', 'Even', 'liberal', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'someone', 'income', 'should', 'be', 'seized', 'redistributed', 'less', 'fortunate', 'income', 'was', 'made', 'fairly', 'honestly', 'matter', 'HOW', 'huge', 'profit', 'also', 'recognize', 'benefit', 'corporations', 'enormous', 'philanthropic', 'donations', 'make', 'programs', 'serve', 'masses.Having', 'said', 'had', 'roll', 'eyes', 'several', 'times', 'audacious', 'implication', 'several', 'characters', 'billionaire', 'corporate', 'executives', 'are', 'real', 'victims', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'feel', 'sorry', 'someone', 'who', 'lost', '1', 'billion', 'stock', 'market', 'downturn', 'still', '49', 'billion', 'bank', 'laughable', 'people', 'are', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'damsels', 'distress', 'story', 'do', 'understand', 'what', 'Rand', 'trying', 'say', 'agree', 'much', 'theory.Still', 'VERY', 'simplistic', 'make', 'corporations', 'out', 'be', 'victims', 'story', 'lily', 'white', 'do-gooders', 'know', 'just', 'NOT', 'true', 'Enron', 'anyone', 'Rand', 'wrote', 'novel', '60+', 'years', 'CEOs', 'raided', 'employee', 'IRA', 'accounts', 'mass', 'layoffs', 'manufacturing', 'was', 'sent', 'China', 'Mexico', 'mortgage', 'fraud', 'tragedy', ""n't"", 'even', 'imply', 'story', 'most', 'corporations', 'so', 'saintly', 'are', 'polluting', 'environment', 'colossal', 'scale', 'mercury', 'dumps', 'ocean', 'oil', 'spills', 'etc', 'really', 'helping', 'hold', 'world', 'up', 'improve', 'society', 'CRINGED', 'when', 'Rearden', 'even', 'likeable', 'character', 'said', 'Dagney', 'WE', ""'RE"", 'ones', 'who', 'really', 'matter', '[', 'world', ']', 'Ugh', 'Really', 'humans', 'forget', 'money', 'was', ""n't"", 'always', 'WE', 'CREATED', 'money', 'Life', 'can', 'go', 'just', 'fine', 'money', 'who', 'was', 'REALLY', 'mattered', 'Let', 'see', 'was', 'farmers', 'tailors', 'home', 'builders', 'innkeepers', 'blacksmiths', 'bakers', 'medicine', 'man', 'etc', 'was', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'tangible', 'skills', 'could', 'meet', 'most', 'important', 'necessities', 'life', 'NOT', '21st', 'Century', 'corporate', 'autocrats', 'just', 'push', 'paper', 'desk', 'move', 'computer', 'blips', 'screen', 'make', 'more', 'money', 'How', 'make', 'world', 'better', 'place', 'How', 'make', 'matter', 'more', 'think', 'not', 'provide', 'REAL', 'tangible', 'service', 'world', 'Let', 'not', 'forget', 'artists', 'poets', 'singers', 'composers', 'dancers', 'painters', 'who', 'have', 'enriched', 'world', 'soul', 'ways', 'what', 'are', 'simply', 'incalculable', 'value', 'What', 'do', 'corporate', 'heads', 'REALLY', 'provide', 'directly', 'own', 'hands', 'really', 'contribute', 'society', 'money', 'disappeared', 'earth', 'tomorrow', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'trade', 'share', 'create', 'way', 'world', 'Nothing', '99', '%', 'are', 'truly', 'salt', 'earth', '.So', 'let', 'keep', 'perspective', 'Rand', 'VERY', 'black', 'white', 'approach', 'may', 'say', 'very', 'dated', 'one', 'why', 'ended', 'up', 'feeling', 'conflicted', 'understand', 'need', 'corporate', 'freedom', 'society', 'government', 'corruption', 'should', 'be', 'rooted', 'out', 'levels', 'so', 'should', 'corporate', 'corruption', 'also', 'need', 'remember', 'people', 'make', 'world', 'great', 'NOT', 'companies', 'what', 'are', 'companies', 'groups', 'people', 'anyway']",Atlas Shrugged: Part 1

Buckley, Jr., later disavowed her, although Alan Greenspan was an economics student of hers [he did not follow her lessons, especially in later years]).The Fountainheadwas made into a 1949 movie with Gary Cooper.  Although Rand reportedly was a consultant on the picture, apparently she was unhappy with the way Hollywood treated her book, which was why there was no ATLAS SHRUGGED movie until now.Even after Rand's death in 1983, it took years of legal wrangling with her estate before the movie rights to ATLAS SHRUGGED were finally acquired. There were several false alarms, and no major studio would touch it because of the controversial nature of the material.  Finally, the movie was released in spring 2011.The movie is actually quite enjoyable and the story is compelling.  Although the actors are little-known, they do an excellent job, and the film defends the Objectivist philosophy quite well.The movie only covers the first part of the book, so the story is incomplete.  This was supposed to be the first of three ATLAS SHRUGGED pictures, but since Part 1 bombed at the box office, there probably won't be a Part 2 or 3, unless healthy DVD sales lead to a direct-to-video release.  So enjoy the movie for what it is; this is probably all you are going to get.UPDATE: I saw ATLAS SHRUGGED: PART 2 in the theater last Saturday (October 13).  It has a totally different cast, and was a good continuation of the story (the movie ends when Dagny Taggert, the lead character, finally meets the elusive John Galt, after being injured in a plane crash).  I will probably buy the PART 2 DVD when it is released; it's not doing too well at the box office right now, so I have a feeling that if PART 3 is made, it will probably go directly to DVD and will never see the light of a theater.WhileAtlas Shruggedis a long book (over 1200 pages, much too long for me), perhaps a more talented producer will make a single, more cohesive movie that covers the gist of the entire story, rather than have three different movies with three different casts.

As a screenwriter, I've thought for years about how to adapt it -- and always wanted the chance. I would read that this company or that company had the rights, but it never got made. Then a small, committed production company funded on a shoestring did this remarkable adaptation.My admiration for the movie is on many levels -- but as I watched it (on its opening night in a standing room only screening), all I could think was: They got it right. This is such a difficult book to turn into film, and yet they caught all the important nuances, put in all the important characters, and did it in a way that is so wonderfully cinematic ...I couldn't believe it was so good!I saw the film three times in the theaters (fortunately for me, the only theater it played in the area happened to be my neighborhood theater, so it was easy to get to). The first night, there were no seats left for the 7 pm showing. By the last night of the engagement three weeks later, I was the only one in the theater.It was still terrific. I bought the soundtrack CD and have played it many times, and can't wait for the DVD. The actors fit their roles perfectly -- not an easy task, when you consider how well known and loved these characters are, and for over 50 years. Everyone has an idea of who they are and how they should be played -- but I didn't find fault with a single actor, and I thought Grant Bowles, in particular, could not have been more perfect as Hank Reardon.It's also remarkable that Rand's characters did not somehow morph into stock Hollywood caricatures (it would have been so easy to make that happen) -- they remained very much who they were, and this story about big business that played out in boardrooms and quiet conferences became riveting to watch.Bravo to the film company -- can't wait for this DVD -- can't wait even more for the second installment of ATLAS SHRUGGED, which has been announced as opening in the fall of 2012.And I can't help thinking that the movie poster should have included a few words: ""NOW MORE THAN EVER ...

Atlas Shrugged outshines them all like a diamond among so much charcoal.It's interesting how a movie based on a book written in 1957 could be so relevant for today as to make it ""prophetic"" in it's portrayal of an America brought low by the machinations of sleazy socialists, aided & abetted by depraved incompetents at every level.Having said that, I can well understand now why the ""gate-keepers"" of the movie industry have treated it with such disdain.The acting in it is excellent!

1495340,A1DV6NTPQRWZE3,B005N4DMMG,thepete8,"[5, 7]","For me, Atlas Shrugged is one of the ten greatest novels ever written, and I can say that even though I do not necessarily agree with Objectivism. With that backstory, I went into this flick with high demands but not super high expectations. While this is not a stellar film experience, I must say I was engrossed! For me, an Atlas Shrugged movie would have to do three things really well: convey the philosophy, rock the plot, and get the characters right.Rand's philosophy gets very little air time here, but I'll give Part 1 a pass because this is a trilogy. The director may be relying on the second or third 'acts' to develop the philosophical angles. Since Rand did her philosophy to death in some portions of her book, a less heavy-handed approach could be a plus.In terms of distilling Rand's mammoth plot, I think they made some good choices. As opposed to the slow economic decline Rand painted, we start out in the middle of a crisis. This was a brilliant choice as it allowed a good deal of explication to be avoided. We now know what the problem is, so the film can focus on who caused it, who can stop it, and what's in their way. I also like how they drew the crisis into parallel with some of the feelings and issues Americans have today. They also quickly deal with the obvious plot problem: why should the audience care about railroads? This issue is credibly handled in the first minutes of the movie, and it was wise not to dwell on it. The use of blackberrys and texting seems shocking in Rand's speechifying world, but they are a perfect way to telegraph some of the conversations and keep things moving.On the downside I'm not keen on the early revelation of a man behind the 'disappearances', perhaps because I felt the mystery aspect of the novel was one of the key plot hooks. Even though the way they have the men 'disappear' makes good dramatic use of the visual medium, I still feel they could do more with it. The 'destroyer' could be portrayed in a horror movie, stalker way (he kind of is already with the shadows and waiting for people to be alone). Have some fun with it! I also found the pacing a bit rushed, but I also find Gone With the Wind rushed compared to the book. Perhaps any movie based on a book this big can't help but seem rushed by comparison. No matter, a longer run time (an extra 30 minutes would only take us to 2 hours) is clearly needed. Given the trilogy approach, a longer run time would help with pacing but wouldn't burden the audience too much.As for the actors inhabiting these larger than life roles, I like the choices they made though there is some wooden acting. The actress who plays Dagny is sometimes a bit stiff (and I'm not sure she knows how to walk in heels), but she definitely 'gets' the character and conveys her aura. Hank Rearden is also well-played, and the actor is physically perfect for the role. The jury is still out on John Galt and Francisco D'Anconia who each get minimal screen time, although the updating of playboy Francisco into a 'playa' is pitch perfect. Likewise, the updating of James Taggart into the typical do-nothing, pampered executive all too common in the business world today is spot on. We'll see how the actor does as his character starts to show his true colors. A big plus is the guy who plays Ellis Wyatt! He totally sinks his teeth into the role and steals the scenes he's in. On the other hand, the woman who plays Lillian Rearden needs more juice. She's playing the vixen-bitch in this philosophical soap opera, and she should camp it up a bit. The actor playing Hugh Akston was able - in one minute of screen time - to repel me. He played Akston with the aura of a surly Walmart check-out clerk rather than a brilliant scholar. Terrible choice and actor.One surprising note is how the saggier acting moments were more than offset by the benefits of the cast of virtual unknowns (or at least a cast with low recognition quotient). These actors were definitely committed to their roles. Besides, I find it terribly distracting in dramatic movies to have recognizeable stars onscreen. It's like when I saw a biopic on Jane Austin starring Anne Hathaway. I never got past the fact that I was watching Anne-Hathaway-playing-Jane-Austin. Of course some of that was her poor performance, but some of it is just the star power. You really have to be as talented as Meryl Streep or Colin Firth to overcome that so that the viewer can forget their watching a film with a star. I don't think I would have enjoyed this movie as much if Dagny had been played by Julia Roberts or Kate Hudson or whoever, even if they did the job perfectly. Brad Pitt as Hank Reardon? Ick.Bottom-line, Atlas Shrugged Part 1 is technically a low-budget movie, but it looks and functions very well all things considered. I thoroughly enjoyed it and, like I said, my demands were pretty high as I can easily hate adaptations of my favorite novels. Part of the fun here was anticipation: how will they handle the lighting of Wyatt's Torch? What will Wesley Mouch look like? From what I understand, Part 2 is coming in Fall of 2012 and I'm looking forward to it very much!",4,It is just Part One!,1324684800,"12 24, 2011",2011,5146,"['Atlas', 'Shrugged', 'one', 'ten',

1495345,A30TBUUJH28S1V,B005N4DMMG,Todd W. Hellems,"[4, 14]","Due to the content of several negative reviews here of this film, I must self-disclose: Only after viewing this film, my first exposure to Ayn Rand since the onset of amnesia from a brain injury, have I come to see just how much of my personal philosophy and my own attempts at fiction is inspired DIRECTLY by Rand. Before that brain injury, I had read ""Anthem"", ""The Fountainhead"" and ""Atlas Shrugged"" and obviously had related quite closely with her characters and her philosophy. I disagree with much of her argument for objective reality and her moral path to clear perception of the truth but I've reached many of her conclusions about the cult of mediocrity and the sovereignty of individualist heroes through other argumentation.That said, this film suffers from a similar problem as the novel. It's wicked boring. None of the characters are interesting, natural, or engaging as humans. They are icons - like illustrations in a technical manual, that work as demonstrative premises for Rand's radical philosophy. Furthermore, the dialog is stiff and delivered coolly, with little emotional range or depth. These weaknesses made it close to impossible for me to pay attention and I had to watch the film in portions with long breaks in between each. Now, of course, the injury I mentioned affects my attention, making my its span brief but I am quite able to watch five or six consecutively viewed episodes of ""Breaking Bad"" or all 8 Harry Potters with little trouble because I care about the characters.

The depression is getting worse and no one can afford to fly anymore. The only mass transportation left is the railroad.

1495349,A2Y55P7L3NFZ2F,B005N4DMMG,"T. Thompson ""Clydesight Productions""","[1, 2]","When this movie came out and it got low critical reviews, I wondered why? The base material, Rand's novel, was certainly intriguing enough, and from what I saw of the trailers, this movie looked very good.Now that I have seen part 1 (the book was so long, to do it justice they have to make the movie in several parts) I have to say I am hooked and will eagerly look for the subsequent parts.To start with, it is an intriguing story, part mystery, part sci-fi, and heavy social commentary. The characters are very strong, and the only down side is a bit of naivet&eacute; on Rand's part about how easily a government can be corrupted by misplaced altruism (although in the movie it is really corporate shenanigans to beat each other out of the market) and how blameless and honorable fiercely independent capitalists are (which history has proved may not always be the case).That was Rand's perspective and the movie seems to be faithful to her vision, which is great -- because movies should be faithful to their source material.So, if you have problems with the philosophy or politics of the movie, look to the original author and not the film. The film is being faithful.Instead, enjoy this film for the breadth and scope of the grand adventure it displays. It delivers plenty of eye candy -- and some food for thought.I have read Atlas Shrugged -- as a book it is a bargain because it is so LONG! You get your money's worth with an engrossing story that goes on and on. The movie follows suit quite nicely.I won't go over the complex plot, but will point out what I think makes this a valuable film:1. It follows the book very closely. Things you like and don't like about the book are here pretty much as the author intended, so the emotional impact is as strong in the film as it is in the novel.2. The production values are high. I have read it was a low budget movie, but it certainly appeared high budget to me. For one thing we see how the rich and ""famous""--  or infamous... take your pick depending on the character -- live and ""hang out"". Everything in the scenery, makeup, and effects look very genuine and believable.3. The movie, like the book, maintains a good level of suspense. Will Reardon Metal fail? Will the John Galt Line succeed in its first run? What is the mysterious ""super engine"" prototype and who created it? Having read the book, I know the answer and I won't give it away here. Suffice it to say, when we find out, there is a definite emotional experience to it.4. The actors are all very good, and there are a few easily recognizable character actors as well as some new comers. As for their characters -- the good guys are reasonably good, and the bad guys are reasonably slimy. But be warned, Rand's villains often come off stronger than her heroes in that they engender a stronger emotional reaction. This movie follows that line of thinking.5. The musical score and soundtrack are excellent. Appropriate volume (nicely equalized) and they avoid the clich&eacute; of musical clashes to alert the audience when something unexpected is about to happen. Nice job.6. Because this is a bit of a hi-tech story (the new metal, the new designs for bridges and other technological advances) they need some CGI effects to pull it off. When we see the new John Galt ""super"" train, it really does look super! I'm a sucker for trains anyway, and to see this neat high speed rail line, even as CGI, was very exciting. It was even more so because much of the second half of the movie is filmed in Colorado with amazing natural vistas and beautiful skylines. This could have been a travel film, the natural scenery was photographed so well.------------------------------Conclusion:If you want to see a movie that is refreshingly close to the original source (with all its benefits and faults), a film that has a ""rich"" look to it, a film that has suspense, mystery a bit of sci-fi or at least high tech, and some really good looking actors doing a great and believable job, then I think you will enjoy this film.5-stars for a job well done that I really enjoyed.",5,Very Entertaining and Thought Provoking - Like the Novel,1349568000,"10 7, 2012",2012,4083,"['When', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'got', 'low', 'critical', 'reviews', 'wondered', 'why', 'base', 'material', 'Rand', 'novel', 'was', 'certainly', 'intriguing', 'enough', 'what', 'saw', 'trailers', 'movie', 'looked', 'very', 'good.Now', 'have', 'seen', 'part', '1', 'book', 'was', 'so', 'long', 'do', 'justice', 'have', 'make', 'movie', 'several', 'parts', 'have', 'say', 'am', 'hooked', 'will', 'eagerly', 'look', 'subsequent', 'parts.To', 'start', 'intriguing', 'story', 'part', 'mystery', 'part', 'sci-fi', 'heavy', 'social', 'commentary', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'strong', 'only', 'down', 'side', 'bit', 'naivet', 'eacute', 'Rand', 'part', 'how', 'easily', 'government', 'can', 'be', 'corrupted', 'misplaced', 'altruism', 'movie', 'really', 'corporate', 'shenanigans', 'beat', 'other', 'market', 'how', 'blameless', 'honorable', 'fiercely', 'independent', 'capitalists', 'are', 'history', 'proved', 'may', 'not', 'always', 'be', 'case', 'was', 'Rand', 'perspective', 'movie', 'be', 'faithful', 'vision', 'great', 'movies', 'should', 'be', 'faithful', 'source', 'material.So', 'have', 'problems', 'philosophy', 'politics', 'movie', 'look', 'original', 'author', 'not', 'film', 'film', 'being', 'faithful.Instead', 'enjoy', 'film', 'breadth', 'scope', 'grand', 'adventure', 'plenty', 'eye', 'candy', 'food', 'thought.I', 'have', 'read', 'Atlas', 'Shrugged', 'book', 'bargain', 'so', 'LONG', 'get', 'money', 'worth', 'engrossing', 'story', 'movie', 'suit', 'quite', 'nicely.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'complex', 'plot', 'will', 'point', 'out', 'what', 'think', 'valuable', 'film:1', 'book', 'very', 'closely', 'Things', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'book', 'are', 'here', 'pretty', 'much', 'author', 'intended', 'emotional', 'impact', 'strong', 'film', 'novel.2', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'high', 'have', 'read', 'was', 'low', 'budget', 'movie', 'certainly', 'appeared', 'high', 'budget', 'one', 'thing', 'see', 'how', 'rich', 'famous', 'infamous', 'take', 'pick', 'depending', 'character', 'live', 'hang', 'out', 'Everything', 'scenery', 'makeup', 'effects', 'look', 'very', 'genuine', 'believable.3', 'movie', 'book', 'good', 'level', 'suspense', 'Will', 'Reardon', 'Metal', 'fail', 'Will', 'John', 'Galt', 'Line', 'succeed', 'first', 'run', 'What', 'mysterious', 'super', 'engine', 'prototype', 'who', 'created', 'Having', 'read', 'book', 'know', 'answer', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'here', 'Suffice', 'say', 'when', 'find', 'out', 'definite', 'emotional', 'experience', 'it.4', 'actors', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'are', 'few', 'easily', 'recognizable', 'character', 'actors', 'as', 'well', 'new', 'comers', 'characters', 'good', 'guys', 'are', 'reasonably', 'good', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'reasonably', 'slimy', 'be', 'warned', 'Rand', 'villains', 'often', 'come', 'off', 'stronger', 'heroes', 'engender', 'stronger', 'emotional', 'reaction', 'movie', 'line', 'thinking.5', 'musical', 'score', 'soundtrack', 'are', 'excellent', 'Appropriate', 'volume', 'nicely', 'equalized', 'avoid', 'clich', 'eacute', 'musical', 'clashes', 'alert', 'audience', 'when', 'something', 'unexpected', 'happen', 'Nice', 'job.6', 'bit', 'hi-tech', 'story', 'new', 'metal', 'new', 'designs', 'bridges', 'other', 'technological', 'advances', 'need', 'CGI', 'effects', 'pull', 'off', 'When', 'see', 'new', 'John', 'Galt', 'super', 'train', 'really', 'look', 'super', ""'m"", 'sucker', 'trains', 'anyway', 'see', 'neat', 'high', 'speed', 'rail', 'line', 'even', 'CGI', 'was', 'very', 'exciting', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'because', 'much', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'filmed', 'Colorado', 'amazing', 'natural', 'vistas', 'beautiful', 'skylines', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'travel', 'film', 'natural', 'scenery', 'was', 'photographed', 'so', 'well.', 'Conclusion', 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'refreshingly', 'close', 'original', 'source', 'benefits', 'faults', 'film', 'rich', 'look', 'film', 'suspense', 'bit', 'sci-fi', 'least', 'high', 'tech', 'really', 'good', 'looking', 'actors', 'doing', 'great', 'believable', 'job', 'then', 'think', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film.5-stars', 'job', 'well', 'done', 'really', 'enjoyed']",Atlas Shrugged: Part 1

Taylor Schiling did an absolutely great job, and all of the characters were believable, especially when compared to your typical Brad Pitt movie. Most of them looked exactly like they could have been real politicians, industrialists, etc. The cinemaphotography was sharp and at times breathtaking. I can only imagine how beautiful the film would have looked on the big screen. Even though it was made only last year, the way that the film almost eerily played into even more recent changes is impressive. The raise of gas prices, increased regulation that prevents the flow of goods and capital through the economy, and the constant emphasis on ""economic fairness"" and the need to ""give back"" presage our current situation.

But the thing is about a thousand pages long--and the problem of compressing it into movie is naturally quite difficult.  Given the challenge of compressing or simplifying the plot to the point were it can fit into a movie format, I think that the screenwriters have done surprisingly well.The whole thing with the Dagny Taggart and Hank Rearden romance was quite compelling--and their first run on the John Galt Line was wonderful.  But after their ride on the John Galt Line and the beginning of their romance, I felt that the plot was speeding up in an unsettling way.In Hank and Dagny's trip to the 20th Century Motor Company to seek out the inventor of the engine, events unfolded too quickly.  To imagine that they were able to quickly find the engine in that huge abandoned factory complex, and quickly figure out from blue prints and a visual inspection of the engine what it was able to do, was a little too hard for me to accept.  In the book they had to hire a young physicist who took weeks or longer to grasp what that engine was about.  Also, to have John Galt's voice explicitly give the pitch to Elias Wyatt in a phone message, about why he should ditch everything and join Galt and his buddies at the end of the film, took away from the mystery of John Galt much too soon.I just imagine that at some point of the screenwriting process the writers started saying to themselves (or the producer or director telling them) ""Christ! Do you realize all the stuff we still have to fit in?  And we haven't even come to John Galt's speech!

(they have completely different actors now!)At the time the first film was released the actors were somewhat unknown although the film has a few recognizable character actors that have been seen in other movies. Overall this film is a good first film based on the book. The sets and props and sweeping scenery between destinations presented and convey well the era in which Ayn Rand was writing ...from then to a forward and modern perspective. I do remember thinking how the first film seemed a bit lackluster...but then saw it again and compared it to the second installment and recognize that on the fast pace shoestring budget they produced with the first one, the effort and effects were actually much better.Grant Bowler and Taylor Schilling were well cast in this film. As was the actor who played her brother and the other character ""Mauch"" (cronyist) both of whom are missing from the second film and replaced with other actors as well. (Apparently, because the first film wasn't a huge success and no contracts had been signed to retain the actors they had to find new actors to do the 2nd film.)The second movie loses momentum visually but does manage to stay on track (no pun intended) to the core message. But completely different performances and sets in the 2nd one make the movie hard to stop comparing. Quite frankly the acting in the first film had a better intensity to it than the second.

1495362,A3S1EUMKDM571E,B005N4DMMG,William Caputo,"[530, 561]","This movie is being continuously slammed by critics and for obvious reasons. It's not because the movie is bad, quite the contrary, but because the movie has a strong message of being both ""politically & economically conservative"" and Hollywood producers despise that message.Thus, Hollywood wouldn't go near this project. This movie was not hugely promoted and the movie actually had to be financed by many political groups just to have it made [but on a shoe-string budget of only $15 million - a lot less than would go into any other Hollywood epic] and it only has grossed around $3 million because it is not in very many cinemas. Hopefull, enough money willbe raised to make Parts II and III to complete the story.This movie was destined to be ""box office poison"" but I hope it gets better reception when it comes to DVD. I will not give away any of the plot here or talk about specific characters. This review is to explain the concept of this movie, which was a wonderful adaptation of the novel it's based on.""Atlas Shrugged - Part I"" is also misunderstood by many people who trash it. It is based on author/philospher Ayn Rand's sprawling 1957 epic novel ""Atlas Shrugged"" which is divided into 3 parts. This movie covers only the first part of that novel [336 pages out of 1168 pages] and so viewers must understand that this is not a complete story like, for example, the 3 ""Lord of the Rings"" movies. Although there were 3 ""Lord of the Rings"" movies, each movie covered an entire book/story. The same can be said about the Episodes 1,2, and 3 of ""Star Wars"" because although they were divided into so-called ""episodes,"" each episode actually told a completed story. With this movie, that is not the case.Therefore, this movie should be commended for that original concept alone. One has seen this concept in television via the miniseries but never in the cinema and, ironically, NBC was the only network that thought of adapting Atlas Shrugged for a tv miniseries in the 1970s [they had Godfather producer Albert Ruddy at the helm] but decided not to go ahead with it because of its unpopular subject matter.So why all of the negative fuss about this movie?Basically because of its premise: In the near future [2016 - 2017], the U.S. economy is a huge disaster due to financial mis-management by big national government [what else is new?] but the govt. covers its hide by blaming big business and they begin to ""put the squeeze"" to business people by passing laws prohibiting them to prosper greatly and improve the economy in order to fool the public into thinking big govt. is solving the problem when in fact big govt. is the problem.So, these productive members of society [whom ""Atlas"" - the Greek God who held the world on his shoulders - symbolizes] decide to show the manipulated public that big govt. is the real enemy of the public instead of themselves. They do this in a very creative and efficient way; they ""go on strike""[Atlas shrugs and the world collapses into destruction] by closing their businesses and leaving public life. Where do they go? They are led by a mysterious man named John Galt to a place called ""Atlantis"" where they can live among and be allowed to be productive members of society without any govt. infringement. There is govt. there but only a much smaller necessary govt. that does not thrive on deceiving and manipulating the public for its own monetary gain while society suffers. What happens to society when it's deprived of its productive members and only has the U.S. govt. to rely on? Society gets 100 times worse than it already is. That's what Atlas Shrugged is all about.This may be difficult for someone to grasp who is not familiar with neither the book nor the economic philosophy promoted here. It is a novel / movie of ""Fiction"" so people who slam the movie for being ridiculous must remember that this book promotes an economic Utopian society and does not focus on realism.This concept cannot be shown in a 2-hour movie so fans await Part II [which will cover pages 337-697] and Part III [which will cover the final part of the book; pages 698-1168].Don't expect action scenes. This movie is 100% politically economic and consists mostly of business meetings, media and govt. manipulation, betrayal, and mystery.This movie is not for everyone. It will attract ""Objectivists"" - people who follow author Ayn Rand's philosophy and peope who favor conservative economic methods [ala Milton Friedman] and a smaller federal government.This movie will repel any government workers [from public school teachers in local government to congress members], union organizers, and bleeding-hearts who believe the only way to get rid of povery is to always subsidize poor people with taxpayers' money so they have no incentive to work and be productive members of society.Personally,  I am not an ""objectivist"" because I believe in God, I don't believe that selfishness is a virtue, and I believe that some minor taxation is necessary in order for a complex society to properly function.  However, this doesn't prevent me from enjoying the works of Ayn Rand, enjoying her conversations regarding her own philosophy of ""objectivism,"" or recognizing that ""Atlas Shrugged - Part I"" is a wonderful and significant movie with important economic, political, and social messages just like the wonderful novel it is based upon.",5,A wonderful movie that will always be

1495363,A3DAIA8AJNHK1B,B005N4DMMG,William J. Dunaj,"[9, 13]","This film is truly great, I was concerned that it would be over acted because of the trailer and I did not really know the cast, but each actor is totally convincing, the pacing is good and the slight variation to update the story works well. Even though it is a novel about ideas and not explosions, it keeps your interest and even has a powerful ending -- despite the fact the story has 2 more parts to go. Liberals hated this film before they saw it, just as they hated the novel without reading it, because they do not want anyone to believe that man can be heroic, creative and self-sufficient - not needing the big government favors and hand-outs, which are extorted from those who are truly productive.  After all, why would liberals want it recognized that man's role is to create and not to parasitically live off the blood, sweat and tears of those who do -- like them, their voters, and those parasitic corporations that are in bed with them and pay no taxes on $14 billion in income due to special tax favors. This used to be a place where the creative and hardworking people could produce and enjoy the results without their efforts being crushed by governmental regulations and their rewards being bled away for the benefit of slackers who vote for more hand-outs. The liberal game plan was identified over 200 Years ago by Alexis de Tocqueville when he wrote that: ""A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves largesse from the public treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates promising the most benefits from the public treasury with the result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policy, always followed by a dictatorship. The average age of the world's greatest civilizations has been 200 years. . . . The American Republic will endure, until politicians realize they can bribe the people with their own money."" Modern liberals did, however, expand upon the plan de Tocqueville identified by spending not only the taxpayers money to buy votes, but also borrowing trillions of dollars more that they could expend to expand their political power. How can anyone doubt we are now at the tipping point: with 47% of all Americans now paying no taxes, or receiving more from the government than they pay in, and almost 15 trillion dollars in debt that must be repaid by our children and grandchildren?The liberals did everything they could to block this film in Hollywood, failing that they now criticize and ridicule it in their reviews - their fear is palpable - when you contribute nothing of value and your existence parasitically depends on expropriating the rewards earned by others, you must dread that they will become aware of your treachery before it is too late. It was 200 years ago that Alexis de Tocqueville wrote those words, predicting that our democracy would not survive beyond the average 200 year lifespan, and the liberals are now using everything at their disposal to make his prediction come true. H. L. Mencken famously wrote: ""No one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public."" Even he would be shocked at what the liberal media has sold to the American people : by portraying liberals as compassionate, caring people - when all they do is take tax money from the people who are the most productive and use it to buy votes, by giving it to whatever groups will vote for them or whatever corporations will contribute to their campaigns. The liberal runs for office promising to give voters other peoples' money, while the Conservative promises to let voters keep more of what they earn for themselves - the latter message used to resonate with the real Americans who built and defended this country, but far too many voters today are seduced by the prospect of getting other peoples' money and voting for redistributionist candidates - ignoring the fact that they are now enslaving their children with the increasing debts they create. Some compassionate, caring people! This film comes out at a portentous time in our history, it would be sad if the liberals succeeded in burying it.

Recent events in the implosion of world-wide banking show just how successful her philosophy of egoism can be, when detached from the high ideals that idealists everywhere seem to take for granted. (In this case, the missing ideal is that people really want to give value for value received - what a quaint notion.) So, we can dispense with the damp philosophy. Unless you're a True Believer.Taking the movie in itself, it draws on powerful icons: railroads, steel mill, oil refineries, and the other massive achievements of technology and industry. The problem is that, except among engineers, engineering achievements hold little place today's popular interest. Does anyone (outside of a few aficionados, one of whom I know) still admire trains as a symbol of power and progress? Not in the last half-century or so. Likewise steel mills, except among aging memories in the rust belt. Likewise oil works, especially with the Deepwater Horizon oil spill so fresh in mind.So, that leaves the personal drama. Flat acting among the good guys and 2D stereotypes among the bad guys don't help - and they really do fall neatly into the black and white camps, from which shades of gray have been banished utterly. Dramatic moments, like Dagny's trade for a bracelet fell flat. (No matter what it's made of, couldn't the craftsmanship in it have been held to a higher standard? Imagine US Steel taking on a Tiffany contract, and you'll get the idea.) Then, the obligatory love scene seemed perfunctory. Admittedly, the original involved somewhat a dark kind of passion for my taste, but at least there was a kind of passion. Oh well.When you take away the movie's philosophical underpinnings, its major symbols, and its characters, what's left? The popcorn, mostly.
