Actually lapsed into thinking I was at a real concert. Began singing and clapping along.  Probably lucky that I didn't get tossed out. Elton really still has it, Even though he Doesn't quite hit the high notes like he used to, but all the songs sounded great. The piano does some awesome stuff, you really have to look closely because it doesn't seem possible. I can not leave out the excellent ensemble of musicians and backup singers.",5,"MUST HAVE DVD, BEEN WAITING for RELEASE",1402617600,"06 13, 2014",2014,521,"['saw', 'limited', 'run', 'big', 'screen', 'sat', 'close', 'really', 'got', 'Actually', 'lapsed', 'thinking', 'was', 'real', 'concert', 'Began', 'singing', 'clapping', 'along', 'Probably', 'lucky', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'tossed', 'out', 'Elton', 'really', 'still', 'Even', ""n't"", 'quite', 'hit', 'high', 'notes', 'used', 'songs', 'sounded', 'great', 'piano', 'awesome', 'stuff', 'really', 'have', 'look', 'closely', ""n't"", 'seem', 'possible', 'can', 'not', 'leave', 'out', 'excellent', 'ensemble', 'musicians', 'backup', 'singers']",The Million Dollar Piano
1696985,A3DYO4PX8Q95VB,B00K0HD7TO,Closer Look TCB,"[5, 7]","Love Elton and this is a very good concert, but some of the performances seem stripped-down. Concert itself is just a little over an hour and forty minutes, and that is with the encore. Gone is Elton's signature epic version of ""Rocket Man"" replaced with a nice version, but i was looking forward to one of his amazing extended renditions of one of his best songs ever. Gone completely are numerous classics like ""Daniel,"" ""Burn Down the ""Mission"" and ""Somebody Saved My Life Tonight."" Best performance for me were ""Indian ""Sunset"" with just Elton and the legendary Ray Cooper, handling what originally included his band and a full orchestra. The encore is just ""Circle of  Life"" but its beautifully performed with a stunning, cinematic backdrop that fondly recalls ""The Lion King"" The only really annoying part of the show comes when many audience members come on to the stage during ""Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting."" The electrifying production and staging is marred by these people almost swallowing up Elton; some holding their cell phones inches from his face. Coming to mind was ""Tantrums and Tiaras"" moments when Elton was not happy when fans invade his space. What some of these fans did on stage re-defines the yword 'invasion' Overall a nice, but too short performance. I have to say, I liked the ""Red Piano"" show much more. Although i could do without the silly inflatables, the use of video sceens was more creative and exciting. I also thought that the ""Red Piano"" show as a video, was better produced and featured many shots of the actual, wonderful staging and production values, which is not the case with this one. If you're an EJ fan, this is worth purchasing, but not everyone will slobber all over themselves in excitement and euphoria viewing this.",4,"Very good but short concert, missing some classics.",1404172800,"07 1, 2014",2014,1776,"['Love', 'Elton', 'very', 'good', 'concert', 'performances', 'seem', 'stripped-down', 'Concert', 'just', 'little', 'hour', 'forty', 'minutes', 'encore', 'Gone', 'Elton', 'signature', 'version', 'Rocket', 'Man', 'replaced', 'nice', 'version', 'i', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'one', 'amazing', 'extended', 'renditions', 'one', 'best', 'songs', 'ever', 'Gone', 'completely', 'are', 'numerous', 'classics', 'Daniel', 'Burn', 'Down', 'Mission', 'Somebody', 'Saved', 'My', 'Life', 'Tonight', 'Best', 'performance', 'were', 'Indian', 'Sunset', 'just', 'Elton', 'legendary', 'Ray', 'Cooper', 'handling', 'what', 'originally', 'included', 'band', 'full', 'orchestra', 'encore', 'just', 'Circle', 'Life', 'beautifully', 'performed', 'stunning', 'cinematic', 'backdrop', 'fondly', 'Lion', 'King', 'only', 'really', 'annoying', 'part', 'show', 'when', 'many', 'audience', 'members', 'come', 'stage', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Alright', 'Fighting', 'electrifying', 'production', 'staging', 'marred', 'people', 'almost', 'swallowing', 'up', 'Elton', 'holding', 'cell', 'phones', 'inches', 'face', 'Coming', 'mind', 'was', 'Tantrums', 'Tiaras', 'moments', 'when', 'Elton', 'was', 'not', 'happy', 'when', 'fans', 'invade', 'space', 'What', 'fans', 'did', 'stage', 're-defines', 'yword', ""'invasion"", 'nice', 'too', 'short', 'performance', 'have', 'say', 'liked', 'Red', 'Piano', 'show', 'much', 'more', 'i', 'could', 'do', 'silly', 'inflatables', 'use', 'video', 'sceens', 'was', 'more', 'creative', 'exciting', 'also', 'thought', 'Red', 'Piano', 'show', 'video', 'was', 'better', 'produced', 'featured', 'many', 'shots', 'actual', 'wonderful', 'staging', 'production', 'values', 'not', 'case', 'one', ""'re"", 'EJ', 'fan', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'not', 'everyone', 'will', 'slobber', 'excitement', 'euphoria', 'viewing']",The Million Dollar Piano
1696986,AT3FXRUH0EHDF,B00K0HD7TO,"D. Michael Elkins ""D. Michael Elkins""","[7, 8]","Super-ornate lighting and staging surround Sir Elton during this outstanding show(s) from Caesar's Palace featuring a Yamaha $1,000,000 (actually 1.4 million dollar) piano with LED lighting.  Frankly the piano's effects were only a small portion of what must have been an incredible visual and sonic experience for the 4000 people in attendance.  There was so much going on in the background that there were times that I wished the director would have used more wide shots, especially during the performance of ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"" when the audience was apparently seeing a visual depiction of the career of the man singing the song while we disc viewers were left mostly with close-ups of the singer and members of the band.One of the most welcome and interesting performances was the seldom-played live, ""Indian Sunset"" from the ""Madman Across the Water"" album that featured Elton backed only by percussionist Ray Cooper.I don't know about most viewers but when I watch a concert disc, I at least prefer to have the illusion that I am watching one performance.  While most of the band members seemed to have gotten the memo requesting that they wear the same clothing during the filmed performances, backup singer Rose Stone (from Sly and the Family Stone)  and the late bass player, Bob Birch, apparently did not.  I found it very distracting to see Ms. Stone wearing two different blond wigs in shots taken from within the same song.  Similarly, I was constantly amazed to see Mr. Birch's jacket appear and disappear within the same song.  Unfortunately these were not isolated occurrences either; I noticed the same things happening multiple times.Don't let my quibbles stop you from purchasing this disc if you are an Elton John fan or even a marginal one.  The fact remains that I still awarded it five stars due to the strength of the performances and overall presentation.  The Piano Man certainly didn't just phone it in!",5,"Great performances, incredible staging, amateurish editing",1404086400,"06 30, 2014",2014,1938,"['Super-ornate', 'lighting', 'staging', 'surround', 'Sir', 'Elton', 'outstanding', 'show', 'Caesar', 'Palace', 'featuring', 'Yamaha', '1,000,000', 'actually', '1.4', 'million', 'dollar', 'piano', 'LED', 'lighting', 'Frankly', 'piano', 'effects', 'were', 'only', 'small', 'portion', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'incredible', 'visual', 'sonic', 'experience', '4000', 'people', 'attendance', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'background', 'were', 'times', 'wished', 'director', 'would', 'have', 'used', 'more', 'wide', 'shots', 'especially', 'performance', 'Goodbye', 'Yellow', 'Brick', 'Road', 'when', 'audience', 'was', 'apparently', 'seeing', 'visual', 'depiction', 'career', 'man', 'singing', 'song', 'disc', 'viewers', 'were', 'left', 'mostly', 'close-ups', 'singer', 'members', 'band.One', 'most', 'welcome', 'interesting', 'performances', 'was', 'seldom-played', 'live', 'Indian', 'Sunset', 'Madman', 'Water', 'album', 'featured', 'Elton', 'backed', 'only', 'percussionist', 'Ray', 'Cooper.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'most', 'viewers', 'when', 'watch', 'concert', 'disc', 'least', 'prefer', 'have', 'illusion', 'am', 'watching', 'one', 'performance', 'most', 'band', 'members', 'seemed', 'have', 'gotten', 'memo', 'requesting', 'wear', 'same', 'clothing', 'filmed', 'performances', 'backup', 'singer', 'Rose', 'Stone', 'Sly', 'Family', 'Stone', 'late', 'bass', 'player', 'Bob', 'Birch', 'apparently', 'did', 'not', 'found', 'very', 'distracting', 'see', 'Ms.', 'Stone', 'wearing', 'two', 'different', 'blond', 'wigs', 'shots', 'taken', 'same', 'song', 'Similarly', 'was', 'constantly', 'amazed', 'see', 'Mr.', 'Birch', 'jacket', 'appear', 'disappear', 'same', 'song', 'Unfortunately', 'were', 'not', 'isolated', 'occurrences', 'noticed', 'same', 'things', 'happening', 'multiple', 'times.Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'quibbles', 'stop', 'purchasing', 'disc', 'are', 'Elton', 'John', 'fan', 'even', 'marginal', 'one', 'fact', 'still', 'awarded', 'five', 'stars', 'due', 'strength', 'performances', 'overall', 'presentation', 'Piano', 'Man', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'phone']",The Million Dollar Piano

I have to make this short, but the setlist if VERY unique, INDIAN SUNSET, LEVON, TINY DANCER, BETTER OFF DEAD, and many many classics although TOO many up-tempo songs like SATURDAY NIGHT'S ALRIGHT and BENNIE and some others that I could live without (Like PLEASE retire CROC ROCK) - but the presentation is spectacular, Elton is in fine, grufff voice but sounds wonderful and the band on the blu ray in 5.1 adds some notes new to these songs and this is truly a great great full gem-filled show with amazing versions of lots of classics.

Elton John who has been celebrating over 5 decades of bountiful highs and lows, has shown to honestly have the most important legacy after the showcase that The Beatles have shown. His songs still withstand the test of time, beyond what words could ever be said with timeless melodies that still remain remarkable. He has had some remarkable shows cemented in his life, in Las Vegas he had The Red Piano in 2004, but what could follow up with that from a legend that still is standing.The Million Dollar Piano which started in 2011, showcases a piano concept that came to Elton John from Yamaha pianos, a piano that could show lighting effects just as much as the stage show, and a translucent element into Elton John's classic songs. The show which was shot in 2011, was sadly before bassist Bob Birch who had performed with Elton on tour for over 20 years took his own life, as one of the final concert series that Elton had performed with him. The concert is a multimedia event that shows images and concepts set through the stage and Elton's piano, and through the setup is a classic concert of Elton's great classic songs like Your Song, I'm Still Standing, I Guess That's Why They Call It The Blues, as well as lesser-known songs from Elton like Better Off Dead from Captain Fantastic & The Brown Dirt Cowboy and Indian Sunset, Blue Eyes and Circle Of Life. The Extras work as well, as Elton performed a set of songs when he toured for the Peachtree Road album in 2004 in Russia. While I do wish that songs like Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word and Burn Down The Mission to just name a few could've been in the concert film, as well as more recent songs from The Diving Board album like Home Again, there is no denying Elton John and the stamina of his classics.All in all, what Elton John is still doing in his sixties surpasses the so-called talents of Beyonce' Knowles, Nicki Minaj and Katy Perry, who have let their talents go to waste because they have been marketing products than real entertainers. Elton John has had so many great concerts he had done before in Australia with The Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, Barcelona Stadium during the Olympics in 1992, and Madison Square Garden in 2006, for his 60th birthday having the number 60 with his name hanging in the rafters with sports legends like Wayne Gretsky. this is a definite buy for die hard Elton John fans. He has made the music of our times, and it is so amazing after all this time, his songs have never ever gone out of style.DVD Cover: BSongs: APrice: A 1/2-Mastering: AExtras: B+Overall: A-",5,The Million Dollar Legend,1405036800,"07 11, 2014",2014,2857,"['question', 'highs', 'lows', 'music', 'industry', 'fads', 'trends', 'artists', 'have', 'came', 'went', 'are', 'just', 'very', 'few', 'far', 'have', 'still', 'absolutely', 'shown', 'time', 'are', 'still', 'standing', 'years', 'Elton', 'John', 'who', 'been', 'celebrating', '5', 'decades', 'bountiful', 'highs', 'lows', 'shown', 'honestly', 'have', 'most', 'important', 'legacy', 'showcase', 'Beatles', 'have', 'shown', 'songs', 'still', 'withstand', 'test', 'time', 'what', 'words', 'could', 'ever', 'be', 'said', 'timeless', 'melodies', 'still', 'remain', 'remarkable', 'had', 'remarkable', 'shows', 'cemented', 'life', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'had', 'Red', 'Piano', '2004', 'what', 'could', 'follow', 'up', 'legend', 'still', 'standing.The', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Piano', 'started', '2011', 'piano', 'concept', 'came', 'Elton', 'John', 'Yamaha', 'pianos', 'piano', 'could', 'show', 'lighting', 'effects', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'stage', 'show', 'translucent', 'element', 'Elton', 'John', 'classic', 'songs', 'show', 'was', 'shot', '2011', 'was', 'sadly', 'bassist', 'Bob', 'Birch', 'who', 'had', 'performed', 'Elton', 'tour', '20', 'years', 'took', 'own', 'life', 'one', 'final', 'concert', 'series', 'Elton', 'had', 'performed', 'concert', 'multimedia', 'event', 'images', 'concepts', 'set', 'stage', 'Elton', 'piano', 'setup', 'classic', 'concert', 'Elton', 'great', 'classic', 'songs', 'Your', 'Song', ""'m"", 'Still', 'Standing', 'Guess', 'Why', 'Call', 'Blues', 'as', 'well', 'lesser-known', 'songs', 'Elton', 'Better', 'Off', 'Dead', 'Captain', 'Fantastic', 'Brown', 'Dirt', 'Cowboy', 'Indian', 'Sunset', 'Blue', 'Eyes', 'Circle', 'Life', 'Extras', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'Elton', 'performed', 'set', 'songs', 'when', 'toured', 'Peachtree', 'Road', 'album', '2004', 'Russia', 'do', 'wish', 'songs', 'Sorry', 'Seems', 'Be', 'Hardest', 'Word', 'Burn', 'Down', 'Mission', 'just', 'name', 'few', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'concert', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'more', 'recent', 'songs', 'Diving', 'Board', 'Home', 'Again', 'denying', 'Elton', 'John', 'stamina', 'classics.All', 'what', 'Elton', 'John', 'still', 'doing', 'sixties', 'so-called', 'talents', 'Beyonce', 'Knowles', 'Nicki', 'Minaj', 'Katy', 'Perry', 'who', 'have', 'let', 'talents', 'go', 'waste', 'have', 'been', 'marketing', 'products', 'real', 'entertainers', 'Elton', 'John', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'concerts', 'had', 'done', 'before', 'Australia', 'Melbourne', 'Symphony', 'Orchestra', 'Barcelona', 'Stadium', 'Olympics', '1992', 'Madison', 'Square', 'Garden', '2006', '60th', 'birthday', 'having', 'number', '60', 'name', 'hanging', 'rafters', 'sports', 'legends', 'Wayne', 'Gretsky', 'definite', 'buy', 'die', 'hard', 'Elton', 'John', 'fans', 'made', 'music', 'times', 'so', 'amazing', 'time', 'songs', 'have', 'never', 'ever', 'gone', 'style.DVD', 'Cover', 'BSongs', 'APrice', '1/2-Mastering', 'AExtras', 'A-']",The Million Dollar Piano
