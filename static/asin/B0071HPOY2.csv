As others have commented on this movie is similar to 28 Days Later, the ""zombies"" here are really sick people who are extremely aggressive. Although only a bullet to the brain can stop them, so go figure. I would actually compare it as a combo between the aforementioned movie and Rec/Quarantine. The story itself is fine and the acting is fair for the most part. The movie keeps moving at a fairly good pace. It is not a perfect movie but it is not the worst zombie film out there, not close.

THE TERROR EXPERIMENT is a muddles mess of a film that can never decide if it wants to be a disaster movie or a zombie shocker. It throws out references to everything from Area 51 to the attacks on 9/11 to the military's experimental drug use in Vietnam in a vain attempt at social significance that is undermined by the overall unintelligence of the script. The extra money that was used to sign Jason London and C. Thomas Howell would have been better spent coming up with a more inventive plot, but instead we are left with a typically bland revision of George Romero's THE CRAZIES as set in a federal office building.

1524054,A33EN2ZL2MS0CI,B0071HPOY2,Compay,"[0, 0]","Terror Experiment is what you would expect for most low-budget Redbox thrillers. Once I realized that the featured actors were C. Thomas Howell, Judd Nelson, and Robert Carradine (Revenge of the Nerds), I knew this would be a typical B-Movie, but still decided to give it a shot.The problem with Terror Experiment is that there's really nothing memorable about it. Most of the cast offer ""I'm just here for the check"" performances. The writing isn't anything special, and the story isn't terribly original. For the most part, it's a ripoff of ""28 Days Later"" with hints of ""Jacob's Ladder"" thrown in.There are also plenty of plot holes. The biggest of which is that there's a building jam-packed with federal employees on Christmas Eve. Several times during the start of the movie, it's revealed that the date is December 24th. Apparently, not even the guy who carts mail around the office gets the day off.The film was shot well, and the color correction was fine. It looks better than most straight-to-DVD movies, but unoriginal story lines and generic acting performances make it obvious why Terror Experiment was never in theaters. As a diehard fan of low-budget horror flicks and thrillers, I actually don't regret renting this movie.

1524059,A1EA7VXIUZBYIK,B0071HPOY2,"Jason Brown ""Dark-edged Apologist""","[5, 6]","I've decided to not attack all the prior reviews, those are their opinions, therefore, here's mine.From the synopsis, I could tell it'd be yet another independent zombie flick in the veins of 28 Days/Weeks Later (albeit in a confined space), so I knew not to expect perfection. Still, for what I watched, it really wasn't that bad.Story was simple, a terrorist with an extremist patriot complex believes he sees political hypocrisy in his own nation and wishes to see something like a ""reset"" (as I'd call it) by exposing deadly secrets in a government building. Those secrets being a deadly virus that changes the mindset of a person, making them highly paranoid and overtly aggressive. Yes, it's basically a total rip-off of 28D/WL, but it didn't stop me from enjoying. In fact, before all the action really starts, you get to see all the little things in normal lives, including that of a divorced couple (along with a small touch of humor before total insanity breaks loose), play out.There weren't that many jump moments, but what there was was pretty decent since it went very well with the story. Some pretty crazy death scenes, a few twists here and there, and one particular crazed zombie that seems like a dimwit rip-off of a zombie from Land of the Dead (remember the one that figured out how to use a machine gun? Watch this and you'll see which one's the rip-off).Acting, like that of any low-budget indie, isn't perfect by any standard, but it's still better than some I've seen (2012: Doomsday always comes to mind as the worst indie film I've ever seen in ever single aspect), so there's a plus. Some people, sadly, do die off (in which I mean I wish they hadn't, but that wouldn't be good for the death quota in making a film like this, would it?), but nonetheless, the main character, who's been in search of one particular person in a quarantined building, does have reason, in the end, to hope. And the reason for that hope may end up giving bad nostalgia for those in Oklahoma City, 'nuff said.All in all, especially for an obviously low-budgeted indie zombie film, I pretty well enjoyed this. Nowhere near perfect, but I could at least handle it for what it was worth.",4,"Not all that bad, all considered",1335398400,"04 26, 2012",2012,2190,"[""'ve"", 'decided', 'not', 'attack', 'prior', 'reviews', 'are', 'opinions', 'therefore', 'here', 'synopsis', 'could', 'tell', ""'d"", 'be', 'yet', 'independent', 'zombie', 'flick', 'veins', '28', 'Days/Weeks', 'Later', 'confined', 'space', 'so', 'knew', 'not', 'expect', 'perfection', 'Still', 'what', 'watched', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad.Story', 'was', 'simple', 'terrorist', 'extremist', 'patriot', 'complex', 'political', 'hypocrisy', 'own', 'nation', 'wishes', 'see', 'something', 'reset', ""'d"", 'call', 'exposing', 'deadly', 'secrets', 'government', 'building', 'secrets', 'being', 'deadly', 'virus', 'mindset', 'person', 'making', 'highly', 'paranoid', 'overtly', 'aggressive', 'Yes', 'basically', 'total', 'rip-off', '28D/WL', 'did', ""n't"", 'stop', 'enjoying', 'fact', 'action', 'really', 'get', 'see', 'little', 'things', 'normal', 'lives', 'including', 'divorced', 'couple', 'small', 'touch', 'humor', 'total', 'insanity', 'breaks', 'loose', 'play', 'out.There', 'were', ""n't"", 'that', 'many', 'jump', 'moments', 'what', 'was', 'was', 'pretty', 'decent', 'went', 'very', 'well', 'story', 'pretty', 'crazy', 'death', 'scenes', 'few', 'twists', 'here', 'there', 'one', 'particular', 'crazed', 'zombie', 'dimwit', 'rip-off', 'zombie', 'Land', 'Dead', 'remember', 'one', 'figured', 'out', 'how', 'use', 'machine', 'gun', 'Watch', ""'ll"", 'see', 'rip-off', '.Acting', 'low-budget', 'indie', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'standard', 'still', 'better', ""'ve"", 'seen', '2012', 'Doomsday', 'always', 'mind', 'worst', 'indie', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'ever', 'single', 'aspect', 'plus', 'people', 'sadly', 'do', 'die', 'off', 'mean', 'wish', 'had', ""n't"", 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'good', 'death', 'quota', 'making', 'film', 'would', 'nonetheless', 'main', 'character', 'who', 'been', 'search', 'one', 'particular', 'person', 'quarantined', 'building', 'have', 'reason', 'end', 'hope', 'reason', 'hope', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'giving', 'bad', 'nostalgia', 'Oklahoma', 'City', ""'nuff"", 'said.All', 'especially', 'obviously', 'low-budgeted', 'indie', 'zombie', 'film', 'pretty', 'well', 'enjoyed', 'Nowhere', 'perfect', 'could', 'least', 'handle', 'what', 'was', 'worth']",N/A
1524060,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0071HPOY2,Mark Turner,"[1, 2]","It seems that horror films today have picked the top boogey man of the heap. With TWILIGHT we've decided not to fear vampires for a while and with the box office failure of THE WOLF MAN we've decided to use the stand by creature we love to fear: the zombie. So many zombie movies are out there as well as the successful book THE ZOMBIE SURVIVAL GUIDE making the best seller list that it only seems natural that film makers would make this the creature de jour of our time. Far too much so.THE TERROR EXPERIMENT may not use our typical zombie but that's how things are going at present. We use variations of the zombie rather than stick with the stand by regular living dead. In this film a secret lab has a problem when a formula being worked on is released throughout the building. Except that it doesn't hit all floors. But the ones it does find its way to infects those working there and turns them into mind blowing violent zombies.Okay maybe not quite zombies like we're used to. Remember I said they'd changed a little? These zombies are prone to violence and move as fast as humans do. It still takes a head shot to put them down and wounds just tend to piss them off. Naturally there are a few survivors and their goal is to get out. One survivor's daughter was in day care below so he's concerned about her and rather than just find an escape looks for her as well. The rest are the stereotypical mish mash.While all of this is going on the building has been put into quarantine.  The fire chief is doing his best to control the situation until the CDC arrives to take over. When they do, it becomes a question of trying to help the survivors or simply destroy the building with all left inside to prevent the contagion spreading.This sounds like a decent idea for a movie and on the whole it's not bad. But it lacks something, that extra oomph that would make it either a more horrifying movie or a more sympathetic one. The acting is basic and no one, including the star names attached over exceeds the expectations of a B movie. It could be that the story is becoming par for the course or it could just be that the film lacks that spark that makes it move to over the top status. As it is this DVD is just the usual without any real reason to make it that one you must see.
