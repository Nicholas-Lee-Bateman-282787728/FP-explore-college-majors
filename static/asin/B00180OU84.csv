1158425,A3FHSLWEMH7JD8,B00180OU84,"Elizabeth G. Melillo ""gloriana""","[5, 7]","It is ironic that, though the mockery, pain, and condescension which the 'fat girl' here has to endure are utterly true, there are stereotypes reinforced which could lead to more of the same. One might think that those unaware of the abuse to which an overweight teenager can be exposed could develop some understanding from the presentation, but indeed viewers (who have not struggled with the problem) could think their criticism and misjudgement was justified and even helpful. Nikki is the stuff of prejudice - the girl with the stash of junk food under her bed, who orders and eats a whole pizza while tossing the 'healthy' meal into the rubbish bin, and so forth. As well, though there is a suggestion that her (thin) mother is nagging, judgemental and controlling, most of the words which Nikki 'hears' are in imagination - one could receive the impression that her 'caring' mother is only concerned that the girl not meet an early death from diabetes (as did her father), since the mockery of her appearance is a daydream.Decades ago, I was an overweight teenager (though nowhere near the size of our heroine). I'd love to see a film which shows what many of us really experienced - constant struggles to lose weight, mockery of our weight loss efforts, assumptions that we were stashing junk food or eating sweets when we were not, being unable to be in the company of many people without instant criticism and condescending 'advice.' Such a film would need to include what it is actually like to have a nagging mother - I can remember my own poking me with 'is that all you?!', dressing me in dowdy dark clothes so I looked like a frumpy woman of 60, crying about her misfortune in having the fat daughter no matter how many awards I won for arts or academics. Even a simple Google search will tell anyone that (at least according to medical reports - not my own experience, since I reached a normal weight in my 50s by eliminating carboyhdrates) long-term or substantial weight loss is impossible - that no one could hope to lose more than 10 pounds, and it's impossible not to gain everything back. This film makes it implicit that the 'fat girls' stuff themselves endlessly and do no exercise, as if the slightest efforts in another direction would make them slender. A girl the size of this one could starve off 70 pounds and still be considered 'obese,' and the 25-pound weight loss about which her mother nags would not even show.Though the film is accurate in showing utter cruelty and mockery on the part of the other prospective homecoming queen, its depiction of the main character is so unlike the situation of many other heavy women that it could inspire others to think that they are 'cruel to be kind' if they make similar assumptions.",1,Reinforces every unjust stereotype about the overweight,1265673600,"02 9, 2010",2010,2759,"['ironic', 'mockery', 'pain', 'condescension', ""'fat"", 'girl', 'here', 'endure', 'are', 'utterly', 'true', 'are', 'stereotypes', 'reinforced', 'could', 'lead', 'more', 'same', 'One', 'might', 'think', 'unaware', 'abuse', 'overweight', 'teenager', 'can', 'be', 'exposed', 'could', 'develop', 'understanding', 'presentation', 'indeed', 'viewers', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'struggled', 'problem', 'could', 'think', 'criticism', 'misjudgement', 'was', 'justified', 'even', 'helpful', 'Nikki', 'stuff', 'prejudice', 'girl', 'stash', 'junk', 'food', 'bed', 'who', 'orders', 'whole', 'pizza', 'tossing', ""'healthy"", 'meal', 'rubbish', 'bin', 'so', 'forth', 'As', 'well', 'suggestion', 'thin', 'mother', 'nagging', 'judgemental', 'controlling', 'most', 'words', 'Nikki', ""'hears"", 'are', 'imagination', 'one', 'could', 'receive', 'impression', ""'caring"", 'mother', 'only', 'concerned', 'girl', 'not', 'meet', 'early', 'death', 'diabetes', 'did', 'father', 'mockery', 'appearance', 'daydream.Decades', 'was', 'overweight', 'teenager', 'nowhere', 'size', 'heroine', ""'d"", 'love', 'see', 'film', 'what', 'many', 'really', 'experienced', 'constant', 'struggles', 'lose', 'weight', 'mockery', 'weight', 'loss', 'efforts', 'assumptions', 'were', 'stashing', 'junk', 'food', 'eating', 'sweets', 'when', 'were', 'not', 'being', 'unable', 'be', 'company', 'many', 'people', 'instant', 'criticism', 'condescending', ""'advice"", 'Such', 'film', 'would', 'need', 'include', 'what', 'actually', 'like', 'have', 'nagging', 'mother', 'can', 'remember', 'own', 'poking', ""'is"", 'dressing', 'dowdy', 'dark', 'clothes', 'so', 'looked', 'frumpy', 'woman', '60', 'crying', 'misfortune', 'having', 'fat', 'daughter', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'awards', 'won', 'arts', 'academics', 'Even', 'simple', 'Google', 'search', 'will', 'tell', 'anyone', 'least', 'according', 'medical', 'reports', 'not', 'own', 'experience', 'reached', 'normal', 'weight', '50s', 'eliminating', 'carboyhdrates', 'long-term', 'substantial', 'weight', 'loss', 'impossible', 'one', 'could', 'hope', 'lose', 'more', '10', 'pounds', 'impossible', 'not', 'gain', 'everything', 'back', 'film', ""'fat"", 'girls', 'stuff', 'endlessly', 'do', 'exercise', 'slightest', 'efforts', 'direction', 'would', 'make', 'slender', 'girl', 'size', 'one', 'could', 'starve', 'off', '70', 'pounds', 'still', 'be', 'considered', ""'obese"", '25-pound', 'weight', 'loss', 'mother', 'nags', 'would', 'not', 'even', 'film', 'accurate', 'showing', 'utter', 'cruelty', 'mockery', 'part', 'other', 'prospective', 'homecoming', 'queen', 'depiction', 'main', 'character', 'so', 'situation', 'many', 'other', 'heavy', 'women', 'could', 'inspire', 'others', 'think', 'are', ""'cruel"", 'be', 'kind', 'make', 'similar', 'assumptions']",Queen Sized

When I brought it home I decided to watch it anyway, and it was a rather pleasant surprise.  The commentary this movie made was rather hard to watch, sad to see, and difficult to accept here in society.Nikki Blonsky of 'Hairspray' fame stars as overweight high school senior Maggie Baker who was nominated for homecoming queen by the mean girls cliche at her high school.  Instead of bowing out and hiding in the corner, Maggie decides to lead the charge and become kind of a champion of the people.  She appeals to the outcast (the nerds, freaks, etc. - that is, everyone who is not directly part of or victimized by the mean girls cliche) set and, like the title and movie poster front suggest, wins the crown.  We are routing for the underdog, seeing what happens when all of us who felt like outcasts rise up and become victorious over the powers that be.However, look past the obvious plot of the story and you will see things that you may or may not have ever experienced.  Maggie is haunted by the voice of her insecurities, that horrible demon that lingers over everything you do and say, who just happens to be in the form of her glamorous, thin mother (Annie Potts).  You see her stuffing her face with ice cream and candy and garbage, eating her feelings, trying to hide herself in food.  We have all been there at some point or another, but when something happens that makes you eat and eat and eat until it hurts.  Soon your find yourself 45 lbs heavier than you used to be, and people are telling you the same thing as Maggie's mom is ""Loose some weight and you'll be happy.""  Unfortunately, that really is the only alternative.  The world is not going to change, YOU have to change.  Maggie's weight did not budge through this movie, but she did learn to be a better person and to transform, because she hit rock bottom several times through this movie.  I would have liked to have seen what happened to Maggie after the homecoming events were over, let alone what happened to the person this story was based on.Why not 5 stars?  The movie in general has a very adolescent tone about it.  Understandable as it is a movie about adolescents, but this could have had a more mature nature about it.  It is just as much an adult based movie as it is based on our teenage years.",4,Long live the Queen!

She's overweight, has a overprotected mother who while having genuine care for her daughter's health, still comes off as controlling and discriminatory with her approach.The fat-acceptance movement in America has been looking for something that best expresses the viewpoint of overlooking stereotypes, and I would say that they probably aren't going to find a better outlet or voice in their argument than this movie.

1158433,A2F09EWKV3MTO2,B00180OU84,StillWaters,"[0, 0]","I have to admit that through most of this movie I was a little annoyed. The main character, Maggie, has some serious issues with self esteem and basically has a ""poor me! I'm fat and no one likes me!"" attitude throughout most of the movie. Every scene in the movie has something to do with her thinking she is some sort of victim because she is fat. here are some ideas she expresses repeatedly through out the movie:""You don't want me to be prom queen because I'm fat!""""Everyone gives me dirty looks!""""I can't wear the cool clothes because they don't have them in my size!""The movie played out like it was supposed to be making us feel sorry for obese women because it's sooo difficult for them to find clothing in their size (Most department stores don't carry anything smaller than a size 6 in misses, but they have an entire section devoted to plus sizes. Hmmm...). Maggie repeatedly finds reason to think that EVERYTHING that happens to her is because she's fat and the other girl is skinny. It's get to the point where SHE is the one making her obesity an issue.She is also portrayed as literally running to the fridge and scarfing down a box of ice cream and crying whenever she is upset. Her mom expresses concern that she could get diabetes, but she doesn't want to lose weight because she could be giving into the pressures of being thin.So...it's better to be emotionally volatile and basically have an eating disorder, diabetes and a whole host of other problems, rather than just trying to lose weight because then she can't be a martyr for fat girls?As with most Lifetime movies, there is an element of cattiness and hatred toward other women. In one scene, an obese woman says that there's a ""b*tch at the gym who stares at my thighs"" but that she thinks about the fact that her ""boobs are way bigger than hers"" and she feels better. So I guess that's how women are supposed to feel good about themselves...by trying to put down other women so they feel better?Lifetime Movie Network has made a movie that teaches fat women have serious emotional eating problems, but that we should just ""accept"" them that way and not encourage them to change because it might make them feel bad. Oh and, all anyone cares about is how fat and skinny you are (it's waaaaay overdone in this movie). There were also only two fat girls in the entire school...lol.

""Hey, honey, I'm glad you ate an entire pizza and snarfed on ring dings the whole night!"" But I did like the affectionate lose/lose situation moms of teens find themselves in. She buys healthy food for her daughter, invites her to join her for yoga, and tries to juggle mom duties/ employee responsibilities/ and being a woman and trying to go out and have fun.I also liked how in her TV interview, Maggie compares ""fat haters"" to racists. There is a prejudice against the chubby.I also like how eventually, Maggie realizes that nagging voice in her head (in her mom's body) isn't her mom at all. It's the visualization of her own bad thoughts.Cons: Maggie isn't much of a heroine. She whines too much. ""They don't like me because i'm FAT!!!"" (uh, no, maybe they don't like you because you're too mired in a pity party). She eats too much and too obviously. Most heavy people won't eat in front of others. Most heavy people don't bawl as they're shoveling ice cream into their mouths. They use food, yes. But Maggie's food cramming and dependence on binge eating and hoarding snacks is more indicative of a serious eating disorder. One in which her mother has every right to be concerned about, imo. And teen obesity / early onset diabetes are real concerns.Casting: Annie Potts was very good. Even Nikki Blonsky is good. I would like to ask the casting director: you do realize that folks in South Carolina have accents? Other than Potts, no one had a hint of a drawl. I'm not looking for over the top fake southern accents, but something.
