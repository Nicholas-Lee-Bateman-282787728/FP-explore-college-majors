1379065,A15X4EAOY5QDCO,B0040AT65Q,"A. Lupu ""A. Lupu""","[1, 1]","Change is what this opera is all about. Although Jo wants everything to stay the same (Remember Peter Pan?) and Jo fights change, at the very end she also accepts it as part of life and especially as part of growing up.  The emotional transitions of each one the characters is beautifully portrayed through the libretto and the music.  The music, although modern and sometime atonal, is melodical. If Opera is about expressing emotions in more than words, this is well echieved here. The cast is exceptionally good. My kudos to Stephanie Novacek. She is a great singer and great actor, and it shows.  I was very impressed by how the director achieved the various parallel scenes, when different things were happening in different places (like Scene 3 of first act).The opera is based on ""Little Woman"" by Louisa May Alcott's novel, and knowledge of the story helps for the understanding of the Opera, but it is not necessary. The libretto is very powerful and the music with the repetition of some of the musical themes leads you into the characters and their emotional evolution. Accepting change is never easy, not after the Civil War, and not today. Only death stops Beth from changing.  A very powerful new Opera (Premiered in 1998 in Houston).  Highly recommended, in particular to those that might have the perception that newly composed Opera is not to the standards of the older ones!",5,"""Everything changes, Jo""",1336089600,"05 4, 2012",2012,1392,"['Change', 'what', 'opera', 'about', 'Jo', 'everything', 'stay', 'same', 'Remember', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'Jo', 'fights', 'change', 'very', 'end', 'also', 'part', 'life', 'especially', 'part', 'growing', 'up', 'emotional', 'transitions', 'one', 'characters', 'beautifully', 'portrayed', 'libretto', 'music', 'music', 'modern', 'sometime', 'atonal', 'melodical', 'Opera', 'expressing', 'emotions', 'more', 'words', 'well', 'echieved', 'here', 'cast', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'kudos', 'Stephanie', 'Novacek', 'great', 'singer', 'great', 'actor', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'how', 'director', 'achieved', 'various', 'parallel', 'scenes', 'when', 'different', 'things', 'were', 'happening', 'different', 'places', 'Scene', '3', 'first', 'act', '.The', 'opera', 'based', 'Little', 'Woman', 'Louisa', 'May', 'Alcott', 'novel', 'knowledge', 'story', 'understanding', 'Opera', 'not', 'necessary', 'libretto', 'very', 'powerful', 'music', 'repetition', 'musical', 'themes', 'characters', 'emotional', 'evolution', 'Accepting', 'change', 'never', 'easy', 'not', 'Civil', 'War', 'not', 'today', 'Only', 'death', 'stops', 'Beth', 'changing', 'very', 'powerful', 'new', 'Opera', 'Premiered', '1998', 'Houston', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'particular', 'might', 'have', 'perception', 'newly', 'composed', 'Opera', 'not', 'standards', 'older', 'ones']",N/A
1379066,AZCRX02WIKUKQ,B0040AT65Q,"Daniel R. Coombs ""Contemporary clarinet guy""","[14, 17]","Louisa May Alcott wrote her novel ""Little Women"" in 1868, less than fifteen years after the end of the Civil War and at a time when American women were starting to question their role in society. Alcott herself grew up watching the Civil War, was a young adult and - it is said - personally questioned women's rights and roles with respect to relationships, money and position. The protagonist, Jo, is the eldest of four sisters and views her siblings' rush to marriage, their obedience to strong relatives, including mother and father, and even the poverty of the ""reconstruction"" period as unacceptable situations in her mind. Critics have studied Alcott's characters and the author's own life and see direct connections to the circumstances and viewpoints of Jo. As the story progresses, Jo watches one young sister, Meg, rush into marriage to a man, Brooke, who Jo sees as domineering. She watches another, Amy, go off to pursue her dream as an artist and to eventually marry a young man who - at first - loved; and was spurned by; Jo. A poignant and heartbreaking moment in the novel and in this opera is the death of little sister Beth; mirroring the death of Louis May's actual younger sister of scarlet fever. Throughout, Jo is portrayed as a character who evolves from cynical and self sufficient to a young woman who feels alone and unsure to, ultimately, someone who finds her calling as a writer and - in the final scene - seems to be at rest with the notion of marrying a German professor, Friedrich, who she met during her studies. Mark Adamo is one if the brightest and most accessible young composers on the scene. He composed ""Little Women"" for the Houston Grand Opera in 1998 and this DVD performance represents director Brian Large's television rendition but with original casting and scenery intact. Both as compelling storyline and as an opera this succeeds on all levels. Just like the novel, which; for many years, has been a thematic staple for younger readers, the drama is emotional and internal. This is not an action piece or a scenery piece. The performances thrive because of the strong performances within. Stephanie Novacek as Jo brings a strength and determination with the requisite underlying vulnerable to her performance. She sings while shedding tears during Beth's death scene. Similarly, the other sisters; Joyce DiDonato as Meg, Stacey Tappan as Beth and Margaret Lloyd as Amy reflect emotions ranging from bull-headedness to naivete and so convincingly. The male parts - as in the novel - are not the centerpiece. Yet, contemporary music star James Maddalena brings a loving, but not quite fully aware, father to life and Chad Shelton as the love struck, somewhat naive Laurie is terrific. Adamo's music is unashamedly romantic and tuneful. The signature pieces, such as ""Perfect as We Are"" and the four sisters' ""Nocturne"" are emotional gems and the Houston Opera chorus and orchestra under conductor Patrick Summers provide a warm, focused and never intrusive sound. This disc is highly recommended for fans of the novel, for fans of new opera and even for fans of some of the newer ""operatic"" music theater, like Adam Guettel. Adamo is an engaging, talented new voice and I, personally, look forward to San Francisco Opera's premiere of his ""The Gospel of Mary Magdalene""  Should be terrific if ""Little Women"" is any indication!",5,Sensitive adaptation of a literary classic in a fine performance!,1289779200,"11 15, 2010",2010,3373,"['Louisa', 'May', 'Alcott', 'wrote', 'novel', 'Little', 'Women', '1868', 'less', 'fifteen', 'years', 'end', 'Civil', 'War', 'time', 'when', 'American', 'women', 'were', 'starting', 'question', 'role', 'society', 'Alcott', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'Civil', 'War', 'was', 'young', 'adult', 'said', 'personally', 'questioned', 'women', 'rights', 'roles', 'respect', 'relationships', 'money', 'position', 'protagonist', 'Jo', 'eldest', 'four', 'sisters', 'views', 'siblings', 'rush', 'marriage', 'obedience', 'strong', 'relatives', 'including', 'mother', 'father', 'even', 'poverty', 'reconstruction', 'period', 'unacceptable', 'situations', 'mind', 'Critics', 'have', 'studied', 'Alcott', 'characters', 'author', 'own', 'life', 'see', 'direct', 'connections', 'circumstances', 'viewpoints', 'Jo', 'story', 'Jo', 'one', 'young', 'sister', 'Meg', 'rush', 'marriage', 'man', 'Brooke', 'who', 'Jo', 'domineering', 'Amy', 'go', 'off', 'pursue', 'dream', 'artist', 'eventually', 'marry', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'first', 'loved', 'was', 'spurned', 'Jo', 'A', 'poignant', 'heartbreaking', 'moment', 'novel', 'opera', 'death', 'little', 'sister', 'Beth', 'mirroring', 'death', 'Louis', 'May', 'actual', 'younger', 'sister', 'scarlet', 'fever', 'Throughout', 'Jo', 'portrayed', 'character', 'who', 'cynical', 'self', 'sufficient', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'alone', 'unsure', 'ultimately', 'someone', 'who', 'calling', 'writer', 'final', 'scene', 'be', 'rest', 'notion', 'marrying', 'German', 'professor', 'Friedrich', 'who', 'met', 'studies', 'Mark', 'Adamo', 'one', 'brightest', 'most', 'accessible', 'young', 'composers', 'scene', 'composed', 'Little', 'Women', 'Houston', 'Grand', 'Opera', '1998', 'DVD', 'performance', 'director', 'Brian', 'Large', 'television', 'rendition', 'original', 'casting', 'scenery', 'intact', 'compelling', 'storyline', 'opera', 'levels', 'Just', 'novel', 'many', 'years', 'been', 'thematic', 'staple', 'younger', 'readers', 'drama', 'emotional', 'internal', 'not', 'action', 'piece', 'scenery', 'piece', 'performances', 'thrive', 'strong', 'performances', 'Stephanie', 'Novacek', 'Jo', 'strength', 'determination', 'requisite', 'underlying', 'vulnerable', 'performance', 'shedding', 'tears', 'Beth', 'death', 'scene', 'Similarly', 'other', 'sisters', 'Joyce', 'DiDonato', 'Meg', 'Stacey', 'Tappan', 'Beth', 'Margaret', 'Lloyd', 'Amy', 'reflect', 'emotions', 'ranging', 'bull-headedness', 'naivete', 'so', 'convincingly', 'male', 'parts', 'novel', 'are', 'not', 'centerpiece', 'contemporary', 'music', 'star', 'James', 'Maddalena', 'loving', 'not', 'quite', 'fully', 'aware', 'father', 'life', 'Chad', 'Shelton', 'love', 'struck', 'somewhat', 'naive', 'Laurie', 'terrific', 'Adamo', 'music', 'unashamedly', 'romantic', 'tuneful', 'signature', 'pieces', 'such', 'Perfect', 'Are', 'four', 'sisters', 'Nocturne', 'are', 'emotional', 'gems', 'Houston', 'Opera', 'chorus', 'orchestra', 'conductor', 'Patrick', 'Summers', 'provide', 'warm', 'focused', 'never', 'intrusive', 'sound', 'disc', 'highly', 'recommended', 'fans', 'novel', 'fans', 'new', 'opera', 'even', 'fans', 'newer', 'operatic', 'music', 'theater', 'Adam', 'Guettel', 'Adamo', 'engaging', 'talented', 'new', 'voice', 'personally', 'look', 'forward', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Opera', 'premiere', 'Gospel', 'Mary', 'Magdalene', 'Should', 'be', 'terrific', 'Little', 'Women', 'indication']",N/A
1379067,A2PR6NXG0PA3KY,B0040AT65Q,Giordano Bruno,"[2, 3]","... not of Mark Adamo's music, the little of which I'd heard seemed to have substance, but of his skill as a librettist and of the aptness of Louisa May Alcott's ""Little Women"" as the basis of an opera. What would the risk factor be? Maudlin sentimentality, of course! Or else, coy allusiveness to gender ambiguities.Don't jump yet! Its' the coyness, not the ambiguity, that would annoy me. I needn't have worried; Adamo's libretto is neither sentimental nor coy. It's a serious dramatic exploration of the transfer of attention/affection from sibling or parent to ""life mate"", in short, of the process of individuation. The four sisters are ""perfect"" together; they sing of such perfection in duet and quartet, about how rare it is that sisters should also be best friends. Honestly, their sympathy for each other is quite touching; most of 'us' will be reluctant to see that closeness threatened. But ""Things change"" -- that's the repeated motif, in words and music -- as one sister is wooed and won, one sister is frail and will die, and two sisters are impelled to leave home for wider opportunity. Eventually, the bond of sisterly love survives in musical aether despite all physical separation.The stagecraft of the Houston Opera supports the libretto fully: plausible and not exaggerated costuming, crafty stage construction, and Ibsen-worthy dramaturgy/direction. The omnipresent Brian Large handles the adaption for television very successfully. This was not, if I have understand the notes correctly, a live performance, but it has the ambience of one. The best of both worlds, one might say. And yes, there are subtitles, though I don't think a native American-English speaker will need them. All the sisters look their roles. The rich selfish aunt is a bit of a caricature, but she can be enjoyed as such. The casting of Yuan Chen-Ye in the small role of the German professor Friedrich Bhaer was a risky choice, not quite successful dramatically, but not discomfiting enough to diminish the drama. Yuan sings his one major scene, when he recites Goethe to Jo as a mode of courtship, with enough vocal charm to render his physical stiffness tolerable.Jo is the pack-leader among the sisters and the central character of the opera. It's her dismay, at the prospect of her sisterhood dispersing, that drives the story. Sister Meg's declaration that she is in love and will marry comes upon Jo as an abandonment. Then Jo must also deal with the ""treachery"" of her childhood friend, the young man Laurie, who first betrays her by declaring his amorous passion for her -- something she doesn't reciprocate -- but then betrays her again by falling in love with the younger sister Amy when he encounters her abroad in England. The libretto is all about Jo's emotional crisis and eventual growth.Jo is sung and acted marvelously by Stephanie Novacek. It's annoying to see that Joyce Di Donato gets ""star"" billing on the amazon product page, since her role as Meg is less demanding both dramatically and musically. Chad Helton, as the male friend Laurie, and Daniel Belcher, as the suitor John Brooke, both deliver impressive musical performances. ""Laurie"" has the principal musical chores after ""Jo"".  Both Jo and Laurie become more life-like, more worthy of empathy, as the opera progresses, until one actually feels sincere concern for them. That, I think, is the mark of a successful dramatization.And the music? It also expands as the opera progresses. It may well seem abstract and, as one previous reviewer bewailed, atonal in the early scenes, but it gets richer and more intuitively orderly -- more memorable -- in integration with the drama. The sisters' quartet arias are positively elevating. When I play this DVD again, it will be for the music, which I'm sure will become ""better"" as it becomes familiar. There is an ""Little Women"" instrumental suite, composed a decade after the opera by Adamo, that I want to hear soon.

Novacek was new to meand I was very impressed with her performance. The singing all around was very fine with the women just slightly better than the men on average. Didonato was excellent and Tappan was very touching in her death scene. The acting was good to excellent with the women more convincing than the men. The musical score is the highlite for me.

There is no audience.I have a few issues to comment on. I would have liked the balance to favor theorchestra a little more. I attended a performance of the Minnesota Opera and theorchestra had much more impact. The camera work had somewhat more emphasis oncloseups than I like. I found the sets and stage direction not to be as naturalas the Minnesota Opera performance. Some of the subtitles are missing (about 5%-10%). This isn't a big deal because the opera is in English.The documentation is outstanding. There is a very detailed synopsis (about 16paragraphs). There are bios of 11 singers plus the conductor.
