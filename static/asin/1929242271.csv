You should know this is pretty much a home made video(no special effects or reality TV set ups here) BUT the content is extremely valuable. After I watched this DVD (45 min) I immediately began observing for and applying the calming signals with my 2 dogs. The results were MIRACULOUS.  In addition to my dogs feeling calmer and having much more affinity for me, *I felt calmer too*. I came to the conclusion that my dogs are usually agitated and worried because *I'm* agitated and worried!!  I also realize after watching this DVD that dogs spend MOST OF THEIR DAY calming themselves, as well as other dogs and humans around them.  There are quite a few spiritual philosophies stating that one should live in the moment. Animals are pretty good at it. But after watching this DVD, I've come to realize that they WORK on it moment to moment - and we can too.  I also ordered the book which pre-dates this DVDOn Talking Terms With Dogs: Calming Signalslots more material there. All in all, money well spent for anyone who adores their dogs and wants to make their livesbetter.",5,Calming Signals,1345680000,"08 23, 2012",2012,1130,"['DVD', 'be', 'created', 'previous', 'VCR', 'tape', 'should', 'know', 'pretty', 'much', 'home', 'made', 'video', 'special', 'effects', 'reality', 'TV', 'set', 'ups', 'here', 'BUT', 'content', 'extremely', 'valuable', 'watched', 'DVD', '45', 'min', 'immediately', 'began', 'observing', 'applying', 'calming', 'signals', '2', 'dogs', 'results', 'were', 'MIRACULOUS', 'addition', 'dogs', 'feeling', 'calmer', 'having', 'much', 'more', 'affinity', '*I', 'felt', 'calmer', 'too*', 'came', 'conclusion', 'dogs', 'are', 'usually', 'agitated', 'worried', ""*I'm*"", 'agitated', 'worried', 'also', 'realize', 'watching', 'DVD', 'spend', 'MOST', 'OF', 'THEIR', 'DAY', 'calming', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'dogs', 'humans', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'spiritual', 'philosophies', 'stating', 'one', 'should', 'live', 'moment', 'Animals', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'watching', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'come', 'realize', 'WORK', 'moment', 'moment', 'can', 'too', 'also', 'ordered', 'book', 'DVDOn', 'Talking', 'Terms', 'Dogs', 'Calming', 'Signalslots', 'more', 'material', 'there', 'money', 'well', 'spent', 'anyone', 'who', 'dogs', 'make', 'livesbetter']",N/A

With the price of this DVD, you would expect a better quality of video. It looked like someone's home movie. It was only 45 minutes long and trust me, it seemed longer.The one good tidbit in the whole thing was to yawn to calm down a dog. Of course my husband and I both tried that suggestion to no avail. I would not recommend this movie for anyone unless you paid less than $5.00.
