The plot became evident almost immediately after getting into it. Interestingly enough, this was ""not"" the movie I thought I was getting, so I am really happy that I took a chance and watched it (more than once already). It was suspenseful and heartwarming at the same time. As the characters revealed themselves, I became even more interested to see what the outcome was going to be. It wasn't your typical western-type movie, and that's what made it even more intriguing. I loved the fact that you could almost sense beforehand, some of the actions that would occur, but you could not foresee all of them. That makes it a great and entertaining movie.",5,Mail Order Bride,1343779200,"08 1, 2012",2012,788,"['really', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'liked', 'characters', 'liked', 'content', 'entire', 'movie', 'kept', 'moving', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'bored', 'plot', 'became', 'evident', 'almost', 'immediately', 'getting', 'Interestingly', 'enough', 'was', 'not', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'getting', 'am', 'really', 'happy', 'took', 'chance', 'watched', 'more', 'once', 'already', 'was', 'suspenseful', 'heartwarming', 'same', 'time', 'characters', 'revealed', 'became', 'even', 'more', 'interested', 'see', 'what', 'outcome', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'was', ""n't"", 'typical', 'western-type', 'movie', 'what', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'intriguing', 'loved', 'fact', 'could', 'almost', 'sense', 'beforehand', 'actions', 'would', 'occur', 'could', 'not', 'foresee', 'great', 'entertaining', 'movie']",Mail Order Bride

This movie felt like 3 years long.I found acting by the  lead actress to be lackluster and paled in comparison to the lead male who she is supposed to marry.  She seemed to be almost devoid of emotion(which for her occupation, in a way, seemed fitting.  Still, It all seemed a bit too modern for me to believe it is the time period of the old west.  The costumes and settings were the only thing reminiscient of the time period.I haven't seen a Hallmark movie lately, but I seem to remember that this is kind of how they are, all the characters mostly reminiscient of others in their movies (lacking in much personality or substance).  although this one was more down-to-earth and not all lovey-dovey,  it was the same boring style.Ha, one quote from the main character, ""I know that if I tried to live on principles, I would have died a long time ago,"" was totally unexpected, but true to the story and I'm sure applies to many ppl with life situations similar to hers.  This seems like the opposite of what most Hallmark movies stand for, but  basically sums up this one.Every time a chance for engaging/emotional/substantial conversation comes up between the couple, the scene is cut short, rather annoying, and basically any connection to the characters has to be imagined.Became monotonous and horribly predictable about halfway thru but I grudgingly--and painstakingly- finished it.There is a great scene at the end and the overall message of not being hung up on money is positive--but it just drug on...",2,Not horrible.

There is no direction whatsoever, the characters aren't developed, the pacing is bad and the plot is nonexistent.The acting is wooden which surprised me seeing how I expected more from Zuniga and Bancroft since they are decent actors. The best one in the movie was Greg Evidan. Daphne Zuniga was dry as a cracker and Cameron Bancroft was so bland he blended into the scenery.One thing that's hard to believe is someone buying that Zuniga is a mail order bride. Usually they are very young and if Zuniga was trying to play anything under 45 then that's ridiculous. She didn't fit this part at all.The romance. What romance? Bancroft and Zuniga have NO chemistry whatsoever. The scenes with them apart are boring but worse when these two get together. Nothing, nothing about this film was believable and the most interesting thing about this movie was the scenery.I don't watch many Hallmark films but I can see why viewers didn't like this.
