Its about a young kid named Casey whos terrified of clowns. His 2 older brothers drag him to a circus, that same night 3 mental patients escape from the mental hospital and go to the circus. Then things get creepy- the clowns follow them home and all sorts of wierd stuff happens. This film is somewhat interesting and had potential but it does get boring after awhile. You will want to keep watching to see what happens to the boys though. It has some creepiness and thrills to it but i dont think its one of the best horror films out there.

262887,A3CKPNSGA7JOLK,6301712714,"Bachelier ""&#34;1004&#34;""","[17, 45]","The most horrifying film ever made. Clown House does the impossible, simultaneously pedestrian and brilliant, classic and clich&eacute;d, innovative and banal, dull and horrifying, with depressively wooden performances that upon Platonic examination are agonizingly electrifying. It is as trite as an Olsen Twins montage, and as grave as a snuff film. This movie is an abomination.And yet it must be viewed twice. Once with the innocent eyes of an esthete video aficionado, beer and popcorn at hand, watching a horror movie with its usual familiar devices. This is the first level of text, for which critical engagement is not uncalled for. And yet, the more compelling text is beneath this surface, and points to the final aporia. For this is not fictive horror, this is documentary horror.The script takes its inspiration from Lon Chaney's assertion that ""There is nothing scarier than a clown after midnight,"" and follows Casey, an eleven-year-old boy with an unexplained fear of clowns. Against his conscience, he joins his two unsympathetic brothers on an excursion to the circus with a partial agenda to confront his fears. That same night three psychopathic killers escape a local mental hospital and appropriate the accoutrements and twisted guise of the circus's clowns, and proceed to the boys' house to ""unhinge a jack-in-the-box of nightmares for Casey and his brothers!"" This formula is not without charm.And now for the subtext. In the horror genre, there is a visual device of using ""the killer's point of view."" This clich&eacute; is absent from Clown House, but the predator is indeed behind the camera, for director Victor Salva's degenerate weltanschauung is the true iniquity that has been recorded. For during the entire filming of Clown House Salva was raping the child star Nathan Forrest Winters, scarring him forever, smothering his spirit, and debasing him as a piece of meat. Winters' leaden acting is a direct result, for he could no longer invoke his art through the depression. This film, therefore, is not even child pornography, for it is far worse, it is the coded diary of a monster who disguises himself and his art in the innocent thrills of a horror movie. Almost like a clown, yes? Superficially innocent fun, yet underneath a monster, unknown and disguised. John Wayne Salva: Victor Gacy.And this is the horror from which we cannot turn away. This is the ""fascination of the abomination,"" this is Ricoeur's archetypes of sin, defilement, and guilt all incarnate in digital images, for this is evil. All engraved in a 1:33.1 aspect ratio for your convenient viewing pleasure.Yet there is another text at work here: Salva recorded the whole thing. It is almost as if he wanted to be caught, wanted a parent to burst in and chase the monsters away. ""Look at me! See what horrible thing I am doing! I'm getting away with it!"" the twisted child cries into the night, and grows to complete the circle himself.On first viewing there is a pointlessly long shot of Winters undressing to his underwear, which only marginally contributes to the tension of vulnerability. But on second viewing, when we know that we are watching the film through the eyes of Winter's rapist, it becomes the most horrifying shot in the film, and is in fact the probably method of Salva's seduction. Is that Salva's voice calling to Winters ""Let's rehearse this scene [and then I'll rape you]?""Only Paolo Pasolini's ""Salo: One Hundred Days of Sodom"" approaches the debasement of this film, yet Pasolini's painful sadomasochistic abuse of children was all faked. In ""Clown House,"" Salva's off-camera rape of Nathan Forrest Winters is real, and as the narrative unfolds we witness the light extinguished from his eyes and his depression set in. For Winters, the film's ""jack-in-the-box of nightmares"" was in Salva's pants. How happy Winters must originally have been to think he was going to be a movie star when Salva cast him. How abandoned Winters must of felt when Salva returned that happy trust with daily rape and depraved self-gratification at Winters expense. All this psychological horror for this young actor is captured here on film.Dante Alighieri lacked the vision to construct an appropriate circle of Hell for director Salva. But for this film and his abuse of Winters, he is surely going there. That should give us some comfort.",1,The most horrifying film ever made.

This evidence convicted him (for only 3 years!(?)).Anyway knowing that the director is a child-molester makes you spot things in the movie. The young lead filmed changing his underwear showing his nude rear end, his 15 y/o (movie)brother filmed in tight underwear, and his 17 y/o (movie)brother saying strange lines to his younger (movie)brothers like: ""don't feel each other up when I'm gone"" and ""let's see if you got any hair on places where it counts"" such things made me wonder if I was watching a good horror-movie or a child-porn-flick.

262895,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,6301712714,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[45, 48]","From writer/director Victor Salva, who brought us Jeepers Creepers (2001) and Jeepers Creepers 2 (2003) comes Clownhouse (1988), his big screen directorial debut.  The film features a cast of relatively unknown actors, with the exception of a young Sam Rockwell, appearing in his first silver screen role.The film begins by introducing us to three brothers Casey (Nathan Forrest Winters), Goeffrey (Brian McHugh, and Randy (Rockwell).  It seems Casey, the youngest, suffers from a deep-seated fear of clowns, apparently due to a previous visit to the circus a year ago.  This fear manifests itself in the form of reoccurring nightmares.  We soon learn the boys are going to be alone on this particular night as their father is away on business and their mother will be visiting a distant relative.  The boys plan on going to the circus, with a reluctant Casey in tow.  We also learn three homicidal inmates from a local insane asylum have escaped.  Will the inmates find their way to the circus and assume the roles of clowns, follow the boys and terrorize them in their big, dark, empty house?  You betcha...on hearing about some of the elements of the film, it would seem this to be your very run-of-the-mill type 80's horror film, but once you settle in, it becomes much more than that.  Salva quickly displays his talent for creating suspense and tension on screen, while avoiding the more visceral elements so prevalent in the genre during that time period.  The use of light, shadows, and creepy music really combine well to create an atmospheric chiller that almost leaves you breathless at times.  Sure, there's the occasional `pop out' scare, a scene where something jumps out of the dark to frighten and shock the audience, quite a cheap effect in my opinion, especially when overused, but Salva doesn't rely on this technique throughout.  I felt he more or less used it sparingly, priming the fear pump to bring on better, more intricate scares developed by turning things the experienced viewer would expect to see in a film like this around and presenting them in a different way.  And this was done in a very subtle manner, as not to really call attention to the subversion of the normal techniques, allowing the audience to experience a squirming sensation as the film progresses.The pacing seems quite slow through the beginning and well into the middle, and I think there's a good twenty minutes between when the clowns enter the dark and creepy house until their presence is actually known by the boys.  This seems very deliberate on the director's part, allowing for him to let the pot simmer, letting the viewer get unnerved with the knowledge of the intruders well before the boys know it.  The clowns seem intent on playing a game of cat and mouse for whatever reason, but given that they're psychotics recently escaped from a mental hospital, who knows what their methods or motives are?  I thought the three actors playing the brothers did quite well, presenting a fairly realistic portrayal of typical siblings, including all the meaningless fighting and rivalries many would be familiar with within their own relationships with their brothers and/or sisters.  The house itself was quite odd and maze-like, being so very large yet it felt like so little of the seemingly huge interior was actually utilized within the film.  I did feel a few scenes the actions of the characters or dialog didn't seem to fit as well as it should have, but these were minor gripes on my part, and didn't really lessen the overall effect of the film, which was to scare.  There is an underlying plot thread throughout the film, one that focuses on the dealing with of one's own fears (actually, it's more of the core of the movie), but it didn't get in the way of this film providing some generally excellent scares.Okay, as some may know or not, there is a much darker side to this film than what's presented on this disc.  It's hard to provide a review and not mention it, so here it goes.  The director, Salva, got into trouble after some very inappropriate actions with one of the young stars of the film.  I'm not going to go into details, but he was convicted of his crimes, and served his time (you can look up the details on the web easily enough if you wish).  Do I support what he did?  Certainly not...there is a taint on this film, and those who are familiar with the history behind may decide to avoid this based on the actions of the director, and I wouldn't blame them, but I cannot change what happened.  Hopefully all parties involved got the help they needed as it's hard to ignore the talent involved.  I can't help but think it was this situation that caused me such difficulty in finding an affordable copy of the film.The film is presented in a wide screen format here, and it looks pretty good.  Some scenes were a bit dark, and the audio seemed a bit soft at times, but if you are looking for a seriously creepy horror film from the 80's that avoids many of the clich&eacute;s of the time, then this one is a real gem.  The disc is extremely sparse on special features, allowing only for a theatrical trailer and English, French, and Spanish subtitles.  Some may find the film hard to find, but I did hear of a possible re-release on DVD, so I would suggest avoiding the high priced versions.  I actually found my copy on another website, new, for a very reasonable price.Cookieman108",4,An tainted 80's horror gem...,1093046400,"08 21, 2004",2004,5414,"['writer/director', 'Victor', 'Salva',

262897,A1YXGVAKHLCL26,6301712714,CryWolf854,"[1, 4]","Its a real shame that people refuse to give this movie a chance all because of what happened behind the scenes. I know I'm not alone when I say that I love this movie because it is the best Killer Clown movie out there (Yes, I also love Killer Klowns From Outer Space but, let's be honest, that movie is a comedy.). By some of these negative comments, if I held your standards than I would never watch anything Polanski's done and that includes Rosemary's Baby and The Tennant, two staples of the horror genre.What we have here is a tainted gem of a horror movie. Young Casey is absolutely terrified of clowns. One night while their parents are out of town, Casey's two older brothers drag him off to the circus in order for him to try and face his fear. Things do not go so smoothly as a trio of escaped psychopaths dressed in full clown make up and gear follow the boys home and gives Casey true reasons to be scared of clowns.This movie is chock full of scary moments. The house where Casey and his brothers live is huge with lots of hiding places for a potentially jump scares. Two absolutely creepy scenes are here; one involves Psycho Cheez-O standing in the front door and the other involves a hanging Halloween decoration outside. Like Halloween and The Strangers, these clowns seem to take a sadistic delight in teasing Casey and his brothers. They step in and out of rooms and appear in windows, sometimes actually reaching out to grab them when they're not looking, only to jump back before they are seen. In one scene, Psycho Cheez-O literally steps out in front of Casey and waits for him to run away before running after him. I mean it when I say that these guys are truly depraved.While the movie is obviously a low budget affair and yes the writting as well as the acting is amateurish at best, the story itself is very plausible. Any one who has an object fear of clowns can easily relate to Casey and his plight. Who wouldn't be scared to look out their bedroom window in the middle of the night and find a guy in a clown costume staring up at them? And let's not forget that unsettling score that runs throughout the movie. Its so child like yet its able to really send the chills up your spine.Its a true shame that only two people involved in this movie have gone on to full careers; one being the perverted monster director and the other being a well deserved Sam Rockwell who plays Casey older, antagonistic brother Randy. The real tragedy is that the young boy who played Casey has to live with the fact that powerful people (and yes I'm holding producing partner Francis Ford Coppola responsible here as well) all but protect this monster and continue to allow him to make movies while basically throwing him to the wolves. I'm sorry but only serving 13 months of a 3 year sentence is not paying your debt to society and he obviously hasn't learn his lesson. Just listen to th commentary on Jeepers Creepers; you can almost hear him smacking his lips over every skin shot of Justin Long. Or how his camera practically dry humps the guys lying shirtless on the roof of the bus in Jeepers Creepers 2. Its disturbing.I'll continue to vouch on the benefits of Clownhouse as well as enjoy countless re-watches over the years. I even shown it to my four year old niece and she absolutely adores it (a little horror movie buff in the making here).  I would like to say to the former actor who plays Casey that I'm sorry you had to live through what you did as well as having to endure the fact that our Justice system failed you. I hope you have the power, as well as the strength, to move on in life. As for you Victor Salva, I hope Karma gets you in the end and no amount of protection from the Coppolas or studio heads will be able to protect you. We will all have to answer for our sins.

262899,A34IBXM7E8CPWE,6301712714,David Girod,"[50, 57]","I heard all about Victor Salva and the young boy who plays the lead in Clownhouse. And I have to say, it's a shame Clownhouse gets smeared with the scandal. Woody Allen and Roman Polanski are considered great director's, and everyone seems to forget about thier history? Clownhouse is a fantastic little creepy movie. And unlike most of the other 80's slasher flicks, it doesn't play on the same old formula of hapless teens out to have sex getting butchered by a maniac. Clownhouse has real character development.

Frightening.Clownhouse attempts to exploit that popular fear by giving us three escapees from the mental institution dressed as clowns, terrorizing three young brats.  Casey is really afraid of clowns to begin with.  He has some pretentious explanation at the beginning of the film so I won't go into it.  Let's just say he freaks when he sees them.  His oldest brother is a bully and the middle brother is the understanding, bookish one.  They are left alone on a night that falls somewhere between Friday Oct. 13 and Halloween.  Scary.  After several Halloween-worthy cat-and-mouse moments, Casey must face his fears and beat back the clowns.If it seems like I'm being overly impudent here, it's because the movie just hasn't aged that well for me.  I remember seeing it on cable about twelve years ago and being scared to death.  Now, I just find myself irritated at the oldest brother and his witty banter with the others.  I also found myself wondering how long it took to do the clown make-up and did one psycho help the other psycho put his on.  Otherwise, how would you know if you got the back of your neck white enough?

I remember discoving this film through a movie review book (I forget which one) and was impressed by it's five star rating.  Since I was getting tired of the familiar worn-out genre of horror/scare flicks, I decided to immediately sought out this movie because, to be frank, I was bored and wanted something . . . different.  And this movie didn't disappoint.First off, there are some things to be said about the director's personal life but, truth be known, he sure knows how to make smart, scary, suspenseful, sinister flicks.  &quot;Jeepers Creepers 2&quot; is a testament to this fact.  &quot;Clownhouse&quot; is different from most films of this type because its not explicitly gory nor is it completely condescending.  To be sure, there are a couple of dumb moves and dialogue in the film but I overlooked this fact because of the film's atmosphere.  This might have been one of Victor Salvo's first film but it certainly doesn't look amateurist.  He succeeds in making you believe in the children's vulnerability and the sense of dread that surrounded them.&quot;Clownhouse&quot; plays on the psychology of a lot of kids fears: the darkness of night; seperation anxiety (parents have gone off to a party) and, for some kids, the circus...especially clowns.  Personally, I was never scared of clowns growing up but after watching this film, I now look at them differently.  Victor Salvo has a way of taking ordinary objects and places and making them appear sinister:  a smiling doll, a shortcut home, an open door.  I watched this movie repeatedly for months on VHS before it suspiciously disappeared.  I was never able to find it again due to its obscurity and, most likely, director's notoriety; and I thought the film would be a lost treasure.  However, the cult success of &quot;Powder&quot; and the big-screen success of &quot;Jeepers Creepers 2&quot; will hopefully make audience seek out this little-known film and give Victor Salvo some deserved recognition that had been long overshadowed by his personal life.  Like Roman Polanski, Victor Salvo's directoral skills should be looked at seperately and his work should be judged accordingly.  In my opinion, Salvo, the director, is a serious contender to fill in the shoes long owned by Hitchcock.",5,Clownhouse Arrives,1062460800,"09 2, 2003",2003,2316,"[""'m"", 'excited', 'release', ""'Clownhouse"", 'DVD', 'remember', 'discoving', 'film', 'movie', 'review', 'book', 'forget', 'one', 'was', 'impressed', 'five', 'star', 'rating', 'was', 'getting', 'tired', 'familiar', 'worn-out', 'genre', 'horror/scare', 'flicks', 'decided', 'immediately', 'sought', 'out', 'movie', 'be', 'frank', 'was', 'bored', 'wanted', 'something', 'different', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'disappoint.First', 'off', 'are', 'things', 'be', 'said', 'director', 'personal', 'life', 'truth', 'be', 'known', 'sure', 'how', 'make', 'smart', 'scary', 'suspenseful', 'sinister', 'flicks', 'quot', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', '2', 'quot', 'testament', 'fact', 'quot', 'Clownhouse', 'quot', 'different', 'most', 'films', 'type', 'not', 'explicitly', 'gory', 'completely', 'condescending', 'be', 'sure', 'are', 'couple', 'dumb', 'moves', 'dialogue', 'film', 'overlooked', 'fact', 'film', 'atmosphere', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'Victor', 'Salvo', 'first', 'film', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'look', 'amateurist', 'making', 'believe', 'children', 'vulnerability', 'sense', 'dread', 'surrounded', 'them.', 'quot', 'Clownhouse', 'quot', 'plays', 'psychology', 'lot', 'kids', 'fears', 'darkness', 'night', 'seperation', 'anxiety', 'parents', 'have', 'gone', 'off', 'party', 'kids', 'circus', 'especially', 'clowns', 'Personally', 'was', 'never', 'scared', 'clowns', 'growing', 'up', 'watching', 'film', 'now', 'look', 'differently', 'Victor', 'Salvo', 'way', 'taking', 'ordinary', 'objects', 'places', 'making', 'appear', 'sinister', 'smiling', 'doll', 'shortcut', 'home', 'open', 'door', 'watched', 'movie', 'repeatedly', 'months', 'VHS', 'suspiciously', 'disappeared', 'was', 'never', 'able', 'find', 'again', 'due', 'obscurity', 'most', 'likely', 'director', 'notoriety', 'thought', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'lost', 'treasure', 'However', 'cult', 'success', 'quot', 'Powder', 'quot', 'big-screen', 'success', 'quot', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', '2', 'quot', 'will', 'hopefully', 'make', 'audience', 'seek', 'little-known', 'film', 'give', 'Victor', 'Salvo', 'deserved', 'recognition', 'had', 'been', 'long', 'overshadowed', 'personal', 'life', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'Victor', 'Salvo', 'directoral', 'skills', 'should', 'be', 'looked', 'seperately', 'work', 'should', 'be', 'judged', 'accordingly', 'opinion', 'Salvo', 'director', 'serious', 'contender', 'fill', 'shoes', 'long', 'owned', 'Hitchcock']",N/A

262904,A3FUBUJAIGM87T,6301712714,"HorrorMan ""HM""","[1, 5]","This movie is somewhat difficult to rate in my opinion because there are some good things about ""Clownhouse"" and some bad things about it.  The movie starts out with a young boy named Casey who is for somereason very afraid of clowns...he wets his bed when he has nightmares about them.  It appears the boy is about 11 years old and he has two brothers named Geoffery and Randy, probably 13 and 16 respectively.  Geoffery is sympathetic towards Casey while Randy is a total jerk and seems determined to torment them both.Well, a carnival comes into town and Casey apprehensively goes along, but his fear of clowns is incredible.  In this movie, it turns out that his fear was well warranted.  At first, I thought this movie was going to be another ""The Funhouse"" but it was not.  That being said, ""The Funhouse"" is superior in every way to ""Clownhouse"".As ""Clownhouse"" moves along, the viewer notices three individuals who appear to be quite malevolent in nature.  Indeed, these three men kill three clowns and dress up in their clown costumes.  The killing scenes were below average and not very effective at all.  What takes place afterwards is a long and sometimes boring chase scene where the clowns follow Casey back to his home.  The chase scenes are quite ridiculous to be honest with you...there is no way that Casey could have outrun these grown men and there is also no way that Casey would not have heard them running behind him.  Ultimately, the scenes move to Casey's house where the horror in this film really takes place.Frankly, the clowns did not appear to be that scary to me at all...in fact, at times, they looked stupid!.  When one considers the great horror movie villains of the past, the clowns looked pretty weak as far as horror movie villains are concerned, and as a result, these clowns were not very effective in creating horror in and of themselves; but, that being said, Salva does a good job of putting the clowns in position in the house unbeknownst to the boys and that is where this movie is effective as horror movie and becomes quite creepy.  However, this is not enough to put this movie over the hump as a really good horror movie.  I thought the moving around and the boys' lack of knowledge of the clowns in the two story house was quite effective and at times, the movie was quite chilling in this respect, but this is really all the movie has to offer.Once the clowns were discovered however, the movie declined in the level of horror that it had created and this is a sign of an inferior horror movie in my opinion with respect to the classics at least.  Moreover, I thought the times when the clowns actually engaged the young boys in combat were pretty lame...the three men would have easily killed these boys, but I suppose it wouldn't work if that happened, but I think that the movie would have been more effective and credible if the three boys in this movie were older...say, 17, 18 and 19.  Then, one as a viewer, might be willing to ""buy"" how the young boys disposed of the clowns.Another flaw of the movie is the acting in this movie is clearly below average and there is little character development except for Casey.  The characters did not provide the movie with enough of a foundation by which the viewer can actually appreciate the movie as a whole and not just based on it's horror values...in other words, the movie just wasn't very well done or directed as a whole.  Indeed, I did not think that the choice of three brothers was very effective as far as characters are concerned, especially being as young as they were.  I thought it was a little much trying to mesh the personalities of the three brothers into such a short movie.  But, like I said, it is hard to rate ""Clownhouse"" as there really are some chilling moments when the clowns enter the house unbeknownst to the young boys, but that being said, this movie is not without major flaws and all and all, I can only reluctantly endorse this movie as a horror movie worth renting,but cannot really suggest that this movie is worth owning.  2.35 STARS for this flick which in my grading system is about average.  I hope this review is helpful for you in determining the pros and cons of this movie while also explaining the plot without giving away too much of the movie.",2,"2.35 STARS:  could have been three stars, but too many flaws",1116115200,"05 15, 2005",2005,4290,"['movie', 'somewhat', 'difficult', 'rate', 'opinion', 'are', 'good', 'things', 'Clownhouse', 'bad', 'things', 'movie', 'out', 'young', 'boy', 'named', 'Casey', 'who', 'somereason', 'very', 'afraid', 'clowns', 'bed', 'when', 'nightmares', 'boy', '11', 'years', 'old', 'two', 'brothers', 'named', 'Geoffery', 'Randy', 'probably', '13', '16', 'respectively', 'Geoffery', 'sympathetic', 'towards', 'Casey', 'Randy', 'total', 'jerk', 'determined', 'torment', 'both.Well', 'carnival', 'town', 'Casey', 'apprehensively', 'along', 'fear', 'clowns', 'incredible', 'movie', 'out', 'fear', 'was', 'well', 'warranted', 'first', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'Funhouse', 'was', 'not', 'being', 'said', 'Funhouse', 'superior', 'way', 'Clownhouse', 'Clownhouse', 'along', 'viewer', 'notices', 'three', 'individuals', 'who', 'appear', 'be', 'quite', 'malevolent', 'nature', 'Indeed', 'three', 'men', 'kill', 'three', 'clowns', 'dress', 'up', 'clown', 'costumes', 'killing', 'scenes', 'were', 'below', 'average', 'not', 'very', 'effective', 'What', 'place', 'afterwards', 'long', 'sometimes', 'boring', 'chase', 'scene', 'where', 'clowns', 'follow', 'Casey', 'back', 'home', 'chase', 'scenes', 'are', 'quite', 'ridiculous', 'be', 'honest', 'way', 'Casey', 'could', 'have', 'outrun', 'grown', 'men', 'also', 'way', 'Casey', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'heard', 'running', 'Ultimately', 'scenes', 'move', 'Casey', 'house', 'where', 'horror', 'film', 'really', 'place.Frankly', 'clowns', 'did', 'not', 'appear', 'be', 'scary', 'fact', 'times', 'looked', 'stupid', 'When', 'one', 'great', 'horror', 'movie', 'villains', 'past', 'clowns', 'looked', 'pretty', 'weak', 'as', 'far', 'horror', 'movie', 'villains', 'are', 'concerned', 'result', 'clowns', 'were', 'not', 'very', 'effective', 'creating', 'horror', 'being', 'said', 'Salva', 'good', 'job', 'putting', 'clowns', 'position', 'house', 'unbeknownst', 'boys', 'where', 'movie', 'effective', 'horror', 'movie', 'quite', 'creepy', 'However', 'not', 'enough', 'put', 'movie', 'hump', 'really', 'good', 'horror', 'movie', 'thought', 'moving', 'around', 'boys', 'lack', 'knowledge', 'clowns', 'two', 'story', 'house', 'was', 'quite', 'effective', 'times', 'movie', 'was', 'quite', 'chilling', 'respect', 'really', 'movie', 'offer.Once', 'clowns', 'were', 'discovered', 'however', 'movie', 'declined', 'level', 'horror', 'had', 'created', 'sign', 'inferior', 'horror', 'movie', 'opinion', 'respect', 'classics', 'least', 'Moreover', 'thought', 'times', 'when', 'clowns', 'actually', 'engaged', 'young', 'boys', 'combat', 'were', 'pretty', 'lame', 'three', 'men', 'would', 'have', 'easily', 'killed', 'boys', 'suppose', 'would', ""n't"", 'work', 'happened', 'think', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'effective', 'credible', 'three', 'boys', 'movie', 'were', 'older', 'say', '17', '18', '19', 'Then', 'one', 'viewer', 'might', 'be', 'willing', 'buy', 'how', 'young', 'boys', 'disposed', 'clowns.Another', 'flaw', 'movie', 'acting', 'movie', 'clearly', 'below', 'average', 'little', 'character', 'development', 'Casey', 'characters', 'did', 'not', 'provide', 'movie', 'enough', 'foundation', 'viewer', 'can', 'actually', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'whole', 'not', 'just', 'based', 'horror', 'values', 'other', 'words', 'movie', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'well', 'done', 'directed', 'whole', 'Indeed', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'choice', 'three', 'brothers', 'was', 'very', 'effective', 'as', 'far', 'characters', 'are', 'concerned', 'especially', 'being', 'as', 'young', 'were', 'thought', 'was', 'little', 'much', 'trying', 'mesh', 'personalities', 'three', 'brothers', 'short', 'movie', 'said', 'hard', 'rate', 'Clownhouse', 'really', 'are', 'chilling', 'moments', 'when', 'clowns', 'enter', 'house', 'unbeknownst', 'young', 'boys', 'being', 'said', 'movie', 'not', 'major', 'flaws', 'can', 'only', 'reluctantly', 'endorse', 'movie', 'horror', 'movie', 'renting', 'can', 'not', 'really', 'suggest', 'movie', 'worth', 'owning', '2.35', 'STARS', 'flick', 'grading', 'system', 'about', 'average', 'hope', 'review', 'helpful', 'determining', 'pros', 'cons', 'movie', 'also', 'explaining', 'plot', 'giving', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'movie']",N/A

I was quite impressed with it.The plot: A young boy has been frightened by circus clowns since he was three years old. His older brother, 14, is understanding; another brother, 17, is a mean jerk who constantly ridicules the boy about his fears.The circus is in town, of course, and guess who doesn't want to go, but is bullied into it by his oldest brother. As fate would have it, three escaped mental patients kill three clowns, take their clothes and break into the home of the three boys when mom and dad are away.It takes half the picture for the youngest kid to convince his two older brothers that the clowns aren't just in his imagination. Even the police won't believe him.This is one of the best-choreographed horror films I've seen and reminds me of a darker version of HOME ALONE.  The amount of times the two older brothers just miss seeing the clowns is amazing and done with extraordinary skill by the filmmakers. I wonder why this film isn't better known? I've seen worse become big hits at the box office. I'm not saying it's a forgotten masterpiece, but I don't think many will be disappointed if they give it a look.",4,Darn Good Thriller.

262906,A20L3YKLJA2G95,6301712714,Jay,"[4, 4]","Clownhouse is a film that takes me back to my childhood. I can clearly remember renting the video, that's right VHS, on a Saturday night and being thoroughly freaked out enjoying every second. Back then I wasn't aware of the issue surrounding the films writer/director Victor Salva. He was convicted of molesting the the films young star Nathan Forrest Winters, who also stared in Salva's Something in the Basement, and the incident has really tarnished what the film could have been. All that aside Clownhouse itself is a great 80's film switching up the direction of the usual slasher flick of the time.The story follows three brothers Casey, Geoffrey, and Randy who attend a local circus taking place in their town shortly before Halloween. Casey is the youngest and has an extreme fear of clown to begin with making the circus a nightmare event. As he's taunted by his older brother he gives in and goes. Little do they know three mental patients have escaped, murdered the real clowns, took their make-up and costumes, and will be putting on the show instead. Once the kids leave the circus is when the real horror begins, as they were followed home by the psychotic killers still donned in the costumes. The kids have to forge together and find a way to survive the worst night of their lives.For me Clownhouse is a great 80's horror film. If you can put all the behind the scenes issues out of your head then the film itself is very enjoyable. It has a certain creepy feel all over it making you feel slightly uneasy the whole way through. The atmosphere really puts this one over the edge for me. Yes it looks old when watching it but that's part of the charm. The grainy look just adds an extra element of horror making this one very underrated in my opinion. If you're a fan of the clown horror type films this one is a must.

The youngest child, Casey, who has the fear of clowns was molested by the director. Right from the start you can see how the director captures that weird feeling when he films a nude shot from the youngest child, and how he films the other brothers in their tighty whities.

If you can put the scandal out of your mind and just concentrate on the movie, then this movie just might succeed in creeping you out.

The same reason the little guy in this movie gave, or the reason the movie gave. You always see the outer shell of a clown: the costume, the paint, the brightly colored wig. But you never see what's on the inside. In Clownhouse's case, it was three psycho lunatics that escaped from a mental ward and managed to kill three clowns from a town circus.  They then take the costumes, and face paint and apply it to theirselves. Meanwhile, three brothers are at the circus, and the youngest has a great fear of clowns. The brothers leave the circus, thinking everything is great, but the mental patients follow them home. This movie used the usual horror methods. Like the killer following closely behind it's victim without the victim knowing it. Although this has been used many times, it was cleverly pulled off here, and made for some tense and creepy moments. Another method used was the silent killer type. This could be creepy in any other movie, but try looking at a painted on smiling face who's expression never changes, and sound never escapes it's mouth.

262914,ASCR6RUWOU1F9,6301712714,Kane's Review,"[0, 0]","I've been looking all around for this movie at a reasonable price but could never find it for a price under $30.00. It's understandable as to why the demand is high for this film but I'll talk more about that later. After searching everywhere for this movie, I finally found it in its entirety on Youtube and treated myself to a nice watch.The plot of the film surrounds 3 brothers Casey, Geoffrey, and Randy. It's a few weeks before Halloween and the carnival is in town. Casey refuses to go because he has an extreme phobia of clowns after an incident with a clown at the previous year's carnival and occasionally has nightmares about them. Geoffery is typically understanding of Casey's fear, while Randy tends to be more of a jerk and make fun of Casey about his fear. After working up the nerve to go with his brothers to the carnival, he's picked by a clown to be a part of the show, but he runs off in fear with the audience laughing at him.Later that night when the carnival is over, the 3 original clowns are attacked and killed by a couple of murderous psychopaths who escaped from a mental institution earlier that day. The escaped patients disguise themselves at circus clowns and go out on the loose.Unfortunately for the 3 brothers, the 3 psychotic clowns just so happen to stumble into their yard. While staying up late watching a scary movie, the power to the house is cut and that's all it takes for the terror to begin. The clowns invade the house and the brothers are immediately thrown into a deadly cat and mouse game, fighting for survival. The local shop is closed for the night, mom won't be back until late, and Officer Friendly thinks Casey's phone call is bogus and the clowns he's seeing are all a part of his imagination. Casey then realizes he must face his greatest fear or die trying. Will Casey, Randy, and Geoffrey last through the night and kill these demented clowns, or will they all fall to Casey's worst nightmare come true?Overall: After finally finding this film in its entirety on Youtube and being able to watch it beginning to end, this will now be added to my favorite horror Clown movies list. The plot is good for it's time which was 1988 but the movie itself lacks background information on the characters of this film as well as any character development. It just jumps right in with the plot and it takes off from there. My only dislike about this movie is the ending as it's pretty bland that lacks creativity and leaves viewers with a few questions that are left unanswered.I'd recommend buying this movie but because of the high demand, you're better off watching it on Youtube...unless you must have the physical format and are willing to sacrifice money, anywhere from $50.00-$300.000. The reason this film is OOP and at a high demand is because the director of the film, Victor Salva, was charged with sexual abuse in 1988 of 12 year old Nathan Forrest Winters, who plays the lead character, Casey. In 2004, following MGM's DVD release of the film, the controversy surrounding the sex abuse charges arose again and a dispute over the rights to the movie began. Due to this, MGM discontinued selling copies of the movie and has since gone OOP. Now the few people who own this movie put it up for grabs on Ebay and Amazon at a very high price due to its rarity.All in all, Clownhouse is a pretty good clown horror film. Just don't go into it expecting any background character information or a decent ending. As another reviewer said, it's a tainted 80s gem. Clownhouse will always be a rare but classic movie to watch, but not without the disgusting controversy surrounding it",4,A Lost And Underrated Classic To Come From The 80s,1400025600,"05 14, 2014",2014,3631,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'looking', 'movie', 'reasonable', 'price', 'could', 'never', 'find', 'price', '30.00', 'understandable', 'why', 'demand', 'high', 'film', ""'ll"", 'talk', 'more', 'later', 'searching', 'everywhere', 'movie', 'finally', 'found', 'entirety', 'Youtube', 'treated', 'nice', 'watch.The', 'plot', 'film', '3', 'brothers', 'Casey', 'Geoffrey', 'Randy', 'few', 'weeks', 'Halloween', 'carnival', 'town', 'Casey', 'go', 'extreme', 'phobia', 'clowns', 'incident', 'clown', 'previous', 'year', 'carnival', 'occasionally', 'nightmares', 'Geoffery', 'typically', 'understanding', 'Casey', 'fear', 'Randy', 'be', 'more', 'jerk', 'make', 'fun', 'Casey', 'fear', 'working', 'up', 'nerve', 'go', 'brothers', 'carnival', 'picked', 'clown', 'be', 'part', 'show', 'fear', 'audience', 'laughing', 'him.Later', 'night', 'when', 'carnival', '3', 'original', 'clowns', 'are', 'attacked', 'killed', 'couple', 'murderous', 'psychopaths', 'who', 'escaped', 'mental', 'institution', 'earlier', 'day', 'escaped', 'patients', 'disguise', 'circus', 'clowns', 'go', 'out', 'loose.Unfortunately', '3', 'brothers', '3', 'psychotic', 'clowns', 'just', 'so', 'happen', 'stumble', 'yard', 'staying', 'up', 'late', 'watching', 'scary', 'movie', 'power', 'house', 'cut', 'terror', 'begin', 'clowns', 'invade', 'house', 'brothers', 'are', 'immediately', 'thrown', 'deadly', 'cat', 'mouse', 'game', 'fighting', 'survival', 'local', 'shop', 'closed', 'night', 'mom', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'back', 'late', 'Officer', 'Friendly', 'Casey', 'phone', 'call', 'bogus', 'clowns', 'seeing', 'are', 'part', 'imagination', 'Casey', 'then', 'must', 'face', 'greatest', 'fear', 'die', 'trying', 'Will', 'Casey', 'Randy', 'Geoffrey', 'last', 'night', 'kill', 'demented', 'clowns', 'will', 'fall', 'Casey', 'worst', 'nightmare', 'come', 'true', 'Overall', 'finally', 'finding', 'film', 'entirety', 'Youtube', 'being', 'able', 'watch', 'beginning', 'end', 'will', 'now', 'be', 'added', 'favorite', 'horror', 'Clown', 'movies', 'list', 'plot', 'good', 'time', 'was', '1988', 'movie', 'background', 'information', 'characters', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'character', 'development', 'just', 'jumps', 'right', 'plot', 'there', 'only', 'dislike', 'movie', 'ending', 'pretty', 'bland', 'creativity', 'viewers', 'few', 'questions', 'are', 'left', 'unanswered.I', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'buying', 'movie', 'high', 'demand', ""'re"", 'better', 'off', 'watching', 'Youtube', 'must', 'have', 'physical', 'format', 'are', 'willing', 'sacrifice', 'money', 'anywhere', '50.00-', '300.000', 'reason', 'film', 'OOP', 'high', 'demand', 'director', 'film', 'Victor', 'Salva', 'was', 'charged', 'sexual', 'abuse', '1988', '12', 'year', 'old', 'Nathan', 'Forrest', 'Winters', 'who', 'lead', 'character', 'Casey', '2004', 'following', 'MGM', 'DVD', 'release', 'film', 'controversy', 'surrounding', 'sex', 'abuse', 'charges', 'arose', 'again', 'dispute', 'rights', 'movie', 'began', 'Due', 'MGM', 'discontinued', 'selling', 'copies', 'movie', 'gone', 'OOP', 'Now', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'own', 'movie', 'put', 'up', 'grabs', 'Ebay', 'Amazon', 'very', 'high', 'price', 'due', 'rarity.All', 'Clownhouse', 'pretty', 'good', 'clown', 'horror', 'film', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'expecting', 'background', 'character', 'information', 'decent', 'ending', 'reviewer', 'said', 'tainted', '80s', 'gem', 'Clownhouse', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'rare', 'classic', 'movie', 'watch', 'not', 'disgusting', 'controversy', 'surrounding']",N/A

262916,A2M1N8G4W4END8,6301712714,Michael R Gates,"[10, 11]","Young Casey (Nathan Forrest Winters) has an acute case of coulrophobia (fear of clowns), so when his two older brothers suggest a trip to the visiting circus, Casey is understandably reluctant.  Being aware of the young boy's fears, his brothers--especially the oldest, Randy (a young Sam Rockwell in one of his earliest film roles)--tease him a bit, and Casey eventually relents to prove to his bros that he's not a wimp.But at the circus, one of the clowns singles out Casey and tries to get him to come into the center ring to participate in a skit.  Casey freaks, of course, and bolts out the nearest opening in the Big Top.  ""Their faces are fake,"" he later tells his brothers, trying to justify his behavior. ""Big happy eyes; big painted smiles. They're not real. You never know what they really are.""  As the boys walk home, Randy, who has been put in charge of his brothers Geoffrey (Brian McHugh) and Casey while their parents are away, is hardly sympathetic and harasses Casey relentlessly about such ""sissy"" fears.After the circus closes for the day, three patients who recently escaped from a psychiatric hospital for the criminally insane--what other kind is there in a horror flick?--murder the clowns and assume the harlequins' identities by donning the makeup and costumes themselves.  Then they demonically frolic into the night and wind up at the home of--you guessed it!--Casey and his brothers, and the young coulrophobic is forced to not only face his fears, but to defeat them.Thus runs the plot of 1989's CLOWNHOUSE.  And while it takes a wee bit of effort to suspend disbelief and accept the coincidence of the evil clowns winding up at the home of young Casey, the skills of auteur Victor Salva turn this simple story with its somewhat cliche setup into a polished, well-paced horror flick that is actually quite scary.  As a screenwriter, Salva has a knack for creating frightening situations and making them believable, and as a director, he is very adept at milking all the emotion he can get from a scenario without pushing it too far over the top and into parody.With the exception of the performance from a young Sam Rockwell--genre fans have seen Rockwell most recently in SF hits like GALAXY QUEST (1999) and the remake of THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY (2005)--the acting in the film is pretty average fare for a 1980's low-budget thriller.  But the characters do have a comfortable family dynamic, mainly due to Salva's masterfully realistic, believable dialogue.  (Indeed, Salva seems to have a genuine talent for writing dialogue for youngsters, as is evidenced again in his later films like 1995's critically acclaimed POWDER and 2001's boxoffice megahit JEEPERS CREEPERS.)Overall, CLOWNHOUSE is a well-done horror movie basted in slasher overtones, one of the few of the post-HALLOWEEN (1978) horror flicks of the 1980s that is able to generate scares via the threat of violence rather than through the relentless depiction of gory murders. (There is, in fact, very little by way of graphic violence or blood-and-guts gore in this flick.) And CLOWNHOUSE is actually more than just a spook show. It is also a rather interesting comment on childhood fears, the psychological legitimacy of some of those fears, and how a child's life can be negatively affected by such fears if they're not dealt with effectively.Ironically, the public perception of CLOWNHOUSE has been the victim of real-life childhood horror that took place behind the scenes during the film's production. This horror came out of the darkness and into the light in 1995, soon after the release of Salva's film POWDER, when it was revealed that the writer/director had served time for the molestation of Nathan Forrest Winters, the young star of CLOWNHOUSE.  Not only did this hinder the boxoffice success of the critically revered POWDER, but it understandably placed a stigma on CLOWNHOUSE that has caused some critics and viewers to read into the film's plot and visual imagery innuendo that really isn't there.Fortunately for Salva (and for filmgoers), he was able to remove the dark cloud from over himself--if not from over his previous films--with the release of his very successful (both critically and commercially) non-genre drama RITES OF PASSAGE (1999), and he later redeemed his reputation in the horror genre with the very financially successful JEEPERS CREEPERS in 2001.But reviews should be impartial and examine the merit of the film in question ONLY, not taking into account any personal problems that the filmmakers may be struggling with.  With that in mind, CLOWNHOUSE is an excellent little '80s horror flick that transcends much of the HALLOWEEN rip-offs that deluged the theaters during the decade.  The DVD from MGM is a no-frills disc that contains only the theatrical trailer as an extra, but it does offer a good digital transfer of the flick at its original aspect ratio.  And while the disc may be hard to get these days, it is well worth the search.  Fans of horror or 1980s slasher flicks will certainly want to add this disc to their collections.",5,"""A Circus of the Mind""",1122854400,"08 1, 2005",2005,5089,"['Young', 'Casey', 'Nathan',

262918,A157XTSMJH9XA4,6301712714,One of many,"[12, 14]","Plot: Three brothers -- Casey (Nathan Forrest Winters), Geoffrey (Brian McHugh), and Randy (Sam Rockwell) -- are left on their own when their parents leave town for the weekend. They decide to visit the local carnival/circus, even though Casey is terrified of clowns. And boy is this a bad night to choose! Three anonymous mental patients (Michael Jerome West, who is credited as ""Tree"", Bryan Weible, and David Reinecker) have escaped and run away...to the circus! After the show is over, the real clowns -- known as Cheezo (Timothy Enos), Bippo (Frank Damiani), and Dippo (Karl Heinz Deuber) -- are slaughtered by the inmates, who steal their clothes and makeup for a creepy disguise (then again, they do seem quite delightfully mad, so maybe they actually think they ARE clowns). They eventually find their way to the house of the three brothers. And, once they realize the residents are home, they decide to have a little fun. Of course, to the brothers, this will be nothing less than a night of terror! The inmates, for reasons unknown, seem to love a good kill, and tonight they're gonna give these boys a whole house full of horrific surprises!Clowns have always been an interest of mine, and lately I've become even more interested. So, as a horror buff, I figured Clownhouse had to be the perfect flick for my evilly kooky taste. Well, while there are a few parts of the film that are certainly less than genius, I was quite impressed. Most B-movies have to take themselves lightly, or they will be a wreck. But there are a few of them that try to be full-on horror and suspense and accomplish their goal. Clownhouse wasn't particularly scary to me, but I thought -- for it's lack of comedic approach -- that it was executed very well. The acting isn't all that great, but it's not too distracting either. Once the psycho clowns start doing their business, you forget all about any underlying flaws. I think the atmosphere was what this was all about. Not to mention the fact that it was mostly believable. Almost every scene took a fairly realistic approach to the story. This sometimes causes a little boredom here and there, but for the most part makes the movie much more entertaining. The score (often an eerie big-top-ish tune, calliope style or with a music box) was definitely a pleasant surprise -- especially the theme, which can be heard in its entirety at the end credits. And, whether you're rooting for the clowns or the brothers, there are plenty of good scenes and a few creepy moments to satisfy the viewer. The concept alone is a good enough reason to see this, but I think Salva pushed it to the limit and came out with an enjoyable film for any horror fan to own. Overall, I don't really think I have any complaints. For a blockbuster hit, this would've been a bit of a disappointment. But for a rarely known B flick, I've got to give it two thumbs way up.

It has the option of selecting English when the main menu comes up to hear the movie in English, so if you buy this and get the movie and freak out why everything on the box is written in German, now ya know.The movie was pretty good, it's got some pretty creepy elements to it. It really is a unique sort of horror film. If you've seen Jeepers Creepers, which was made by the same guy who made this movie, then you'll be able to easily see that the guy has a thing for making stupid characters do irrational things.

The acting was really horrible which suprised me because Sam Rockwell was in it. It was so bad that I actually thought that maybe they had dubbed somebody elses voice in for Rockwell. The movie was not scarey at all. I could see it being more of a movie for little kids. I appreciate that it wasn't a blood and guts slasher movie that was prevelant at the time. But it wasn't even scarey from a suspense angle either. And it was lit like some neon 80's music video. I had seen a brief clip of this movie when it first came out on VHS a long time ago and remembered it. Then I read about the directors legal problems and his being arrested for molesting the child star of the movie and convicted. So I thought I would check it out. It is pretty expensive even on VHS but I got a copy for a reasonable price. I wish I had my money back.,1,Horrible,1200441600,"01 16, 2008",2008,888,"['movie', 'was', 'horrible', 'dialogue', 'was', 'just', 'awful', 'acting', 'was', 'really', 'horrible', 'suprised', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'was', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'actually', 'thought', 'maybe', 'had', 'dubbed', 'somebody', 'voice', 'Rockwell', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'scarey', 'could', 'see', 'being', 'more', 'movie', 'little', 'kids', 'appreciate', 'was', ""n't"", 'blood', 'guts', 'slasher', 'movie', 'was', 'prevelant', 'time', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'scarey', 'suspense', 'angle', 'was', 'lit', 'neon', '80', 'music', 'video', 'had', 'seen', 'brief', 'clip', 'movie', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'VHS', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'remembered', 'Then', 'read', 'directors', 'legal', 'problems', 'being', 'arrested', 'molesting', 'child', 'star', 'movie', 'convicted', 'thought', 'would', 'check', 'out', 'pretty', 'expensive', 'even', 'VHS', 'got', 'copy', 'reasonable', 'price', 'wish', 'had', 'money', 'back']",N/A

Now this is an Australian website and since I live in Australia the postage only cost $2.99. I'm assuming that it shouldn't be no more than $10 for shipping to the US or UK. But even then you'll be saving a lot more money for a new and sealed copy than even some of the used copies selling on Amazon. The website is http://www.rareandcollectibledvds.com/clownhouse.html.I hope this solves most people's problems when looking for this classic horror.,5,WHERE TO FIND 'CLOWNHOUSE' FOR UNDER $15!,1369094400,"05 21, 2013",2013,547,"['Yes', 'have', 'found', 'site', 'where', 'can', 'purchase', 'Victor', 'Salva', 'infamous', 'CLOWNHOUSE', 'dvd', '9.99', 'Now', 'Australian', 'website', 'live', 'Australia', 'postage', 'only', 'cost', '2.99', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'no', 'more', '10', 'shipping', 'US', 'UK', 'even', 'then', ""'ll"", 'be', 'saving', 'lot', 'more', 'money', 'new', 'sealed', 'copy', 'even', 'used', 'copies', 'selling', 'Amazon', 'website', 'http', '//www.rareandcollectibledvds.com/clownhouse.html.I', 'hope', 'most', 'people', 'problems', 'when', 'looking', 'classic', 'horror']",N/A
