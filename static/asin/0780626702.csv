34979,A1NOLEWY3EBW01,0780626702,683,"[3, 3]","This is one of my favorites from the TCM Greatest Classic Films Collection, especially since it's a Hitchcock collection. These 4 films are suspenseful, romantic, very noir-ish (they're all black and white), dramatic, and they all have that Hitchcock touch. If you don't own any of these films and you love Hitchcock, this is a must own!Suspicion- One of my favorite Hitchcock movies from the 40's. It's a romantic suspense noir, starring Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine (in her Academy Award winning role). I think this movie can stand up right along with ""Laura"", ""The Big Sleep"", and maybe even ""The Maltese Falcon"". In the movie, Joan Fontaine falls in love with Cary Grant, and suddenly she suspects him of being a murderer. It has a beautiful setting, great acting, a sharp script, amazing suspense and romance, and a famous Hitchcock sequence where Cary Grant brings up a supposedly poisoned glass of milk up to Joan Fontaine (they put a lightbulb in milk to make it glow like that). It's a creepy film-noir scene and I love it! Also, Hitchcock did 2 cameos in this film! It comes with a 20 minute featurette about the film including interviews with different people, including Hitch's daughter, Pat, and it also includes the theatrical trailer. This has to be my favorite film from this collection.Strangers on a Train- Suspenseful and dark, one of Hitchcock's most perfect movies. If you haven't seen this movie, you need to see it now, because it's one of Hitchcock's best movies. The film is about a tennis star, Guy Haines (Farley Granger), who bumps into a man named Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) on a train, and suddenly Bruno comes up with a plan for ""the perfect murder"". He insists that he will kill Guy's unfaithful wife, Miriam (Laura Elliott), if Guy will kill Bruno's father, who he hates. Guy takes it as a joke, but when Bruno actually strangles Miriam to death at a fair (in a famous Hitchcock sequence where it shows the murder through her glasses, which are laying on the ground. It has a great supporting cast, including Ruth Roman, Leo G. Carroll, and Hitch's daughter, Pat (she's so cute!) She appeared in two other of his films, Stage Fright (1950), and Psycho (1960). ""Strangers on a Train"" is a suspenseful noir that deserves to be called of of Alfred Hitchcock's best thrillers of all time. As for the extras, other than a commentary and the theatrical trailer, there are no extras.I Confess- This is a very different (and underrated) Hitchcock picture, and it's actually one of my favorites. It has drama, some suspense, romance, and the beautiful Quebec. It's about a Catholic priest (Montgomery Clift) who hears a confession of a man who accidentally murdered somebody. Suddenly, he gets mixed up in the middle of the whole thing, but since he can't say anything because of the secrecy of the confessional, he gets accused of being the murderer. This is actually a pretty diverse movie. It mixes up drama, romance, suspense, and courtroom, with a great ending. Altogether, this is a very great and Catholic movie (Hitchcock was a Roman Catholic). It comes with a 20 minute documentary, a minute long vintage newsreel footage of the release, and the theatrical trailer.The Wrong Man- This is probably Hitchcock's darkest picture. Even more darker in nature than ""Vertigo"". It's a very bleak noir with a shrieking, loud, and depressing Bernard Herrman score. It's also based on a true story, that's why Alfred didn't do a cameo, he did an introduction to the movie, but just showing his silhouette from far away. It's about a man who attempts to borrow on his wife's insurance policy when she needs dental work, and ends up being accused of being a bank robber, and he gets imprisoned. After that, the film gets more depressing and depressing after that. It's a fresh, bold, and different Hitchcock picture that is very underrated. It also has religious imagery, like in ""I Confess"". It's a movie that I just couldn't take my eyes off the whole entire time, because it just takes you into the movie. It's a very unique Hitchcock experience. It comes with a 25 minute featurette on the movie and the theatrical trailer. Definitely see this!Altogether, this TCM set is worth buying. It features 4 suspenseful, romantic, and beautiful movies that you can watch multiple times from the Master of Suspense.",5,One of TCM's greatest film collections!,1316908800,"09 25, 2011",2011,4332,"['one', 'favorites', 'TCM', 'Greatest', 'Classic', 'Films', 'Collection', 'especially', 'Hitchcock', 'collection', '4', 'films', 'are', 'suspenseful', 'romantic', 'very', 'noir-ish', ""'re"", 'black', 'white', 'dramatic', 'have', 'Hitchcock', 'touch', 'do', ""n't"", 'own', 'films', 'love', 'Hitchcock', 'must', 'own', 'Suspicion-', 'One', 'favorite', 'Hitchcock', 'movies', '40', 'romantic', 'suspense', 'noir', 'starring', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Joan', 'Fontaine', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winning', 'role', 'think', 'movie', 'can', 'stand', 'up', 'right', 'Laura', 'Big', 'Sleep', 'maybe', 'even', 'Maltese', 'Falcon', 'movie', 'Joan', 'Fontaine', 'love', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'suddenly', 'being', 'murderer', 'beautiful', 'setting', 'great', 'acting', 'sharp', 'script', 'amazing', 'suspense', 'romance', 'famous', 'Hitchcock', 'sequence', 'where', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'up', 'supposedly', 'poisoned', 'glass', 'milk', 'Joan', 'Fontaine', 'put', 'lightbulb', 'milk', 'make', 'glow', 'creepy', 'film-noir', 'scene', 'love', 'Also', 'Hitchcock', 'did', '2', 'cameos', 'film', '20', 'minute', 'featurette', 'film', 'including', 'interviews', 'different', 'people', 'including', 'Hitch', 'daughter', 'Pat', 'also', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'be', 'favorite', 'film', 'collection.Strangers', 'Train-', 'Suspenseful', 'dark', 'one', 'Hitchcock', 'most', 'perfect', 'movies', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'need', 'see', 'now', 'one', 'Hitchcock', 'best', 'movies', 'film', 'tennis', 'star', 'Guy', 'Haines', 'Farley', 'Granger', 'who', 'man', 'named', 'Bruno', 'Anthony', 'Robert', 'Walker', 'train', 'suddenly', 'Bruno', 'up', 'plan', 'perfect', 'murder', 'will', 'kill', 'Guy', 'unfaithful', 'wife', 'Miriam', 'Laura', 'Elliott', 'Guy', 'will', 'kill', 'Bruno', 'father', 'who', 'Guy', 'joke', 'when', 'Bruno', 'actually', 'Miriam', 'death', 'fair', 'famous', 'Hitchcock', 'sequence', 'where', 'murder', 'glasses', 'are', 'laying', 'ground', 'great', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Ruth', 'Roman', 'Leo', 'G.', 'Carroll', 'Hitch', 'daughter', 'Pat', 'so', 'cute', 'appeared', 'two', 'other', 'films', 'Stage', 'Fright', '1950', 'Psycho', '1960', 'Strangers', 'Train', 'suspenseful', 'noir', 'be', 'called', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'best', 'thrillers', 'time', 'extras', 'other', 'commentary', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'are', 'extras.I', 'Confess-', 'very', 'different', 'underrated', 'Hitchcock', 'picture', 'actually', 'one', 'favorites', 'drama', 'suspense', 'romance', 'beautiful', 'Quebec', 'Catholic', 'priest', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'who', 'confession', 'man', 'who', 'accidentally', 'murdered', 'somebody', 'Suddenly', 'mixed', 'up', 'middle', 'whole', 'thing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', 'secrecy', 'confessional', 'accused', 'being', 'murderer', 'actually', 'pretty', 'diverse', 'movie', 'mixes', 'up', 'drama', 'romance', 'suspense', 'courtroom', 'great', 'ending', 'Altogether', 'very', 'great', 'Catholic', 'movie', 'Hitchcock', 'was', 'Roman', 'Catholic', '20', 'minute', 'documentary', 'minute', 'long', 'vintage', 'newsreel', 'footage', 'release', 'theatrical', 'trailer.The', 'Wrong', 'Man-', 'probably', 'Hitchcock', 'darkest', 'picture', 'Even', 'more', 'darker', 'nature', 'Vertigo', 'very', 'bleak', 'noir', 'shrieking', 'loud', 'depressing', 'Bernard', 'Herrman', 'score', 'also', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'why', 'Alfred', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'cameo', 'did', 'introduction', 'movie', 'just', 'showing', 'silhouette', 'far', 'away', 'man', 'who', 'borrow', 'wife', 'insurance', 'policy', 'when', 'dental', 'work', 'up', 'being', 'accused', 'being', 'bank', 'robber', 'imprisoned', 'film', 'more', 'depressing', 'depressing', 'fresh', 'bold', 'different', 'Hitchcock', 'picture', 'very', 'underrated', 'also', 'religious', 'imagery', 'Confess', 'movie', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes', 'whole', 'entire', 'time', 'just', 'movie', 'very', 'unique', 'Hitchcock', 'experience', '25', 'minute', 'featurette', 'movie', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'Definitely', 'see', 'Altogether', 'TCM', 'set', 'worth', 'buying', '4', 'suspenseful', 'romantic', 'beautiful', 'movies', 'can', 'watch', 'multiple', 'times', 'Master', 'Suspense']",Suspicion VHS

34982,AGEIT17HENDIS,0780626702,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","Everybody knows, well, knows since Dorothy Parker uttered the words, that gentlemen don't make passes at girls that wear glasses. Period. Well, period, except hard up ne'er-do- well besotted, benighted, be-, well, bedeviled and be done with it, handsome Johnnies gents who are slightly arrears on their rent or I.O.U. obligation to their bookmakers. They glasses, four-eyes, six-eyes, hell, threes eyes are in play then especially if they are well brought up love-starved country gentry daughters with a little dowry, or hopes of one. And especially when that certain girl, woman, when she takes off said glasses is well, by the ugly duckling turning camera magic, fetching. And that in a nutshell is the lead-up to this early Alfred Hitchcock classic under review, Suspicion.A few details will help to tell why there is suspense in Suspicion (although not as much as in say the later Psycho, etc. when Hitchcock went over the edge and started to scare the bejesus out of every brave pre-teen and teen boy and girl on the earth by NOT showing us what evil lurked in the hearts of men). Johnnie, well-mannered but broke Johnnie (played by Cary Grant, who else would fit as the downwardly mobile British gent), ""courts"" one plain jane (don't be deceived like I was at first by the glasses) country house gentry (meaning in those days running after foxes, et. al) daughter Lina (played by Academy Award-winning Joan Fontaine), wins her over and they are married. He has no illusions in what he is doing (mainly male gold-digging in order to maintain a studious avoidance of anything that smacks of work and anything that doesn't smack of making a sure thing bet on race day) she, intelligent enough although not really world-wary has more than a few.Up until that point, and somewhat beyond that point, this film is basically a comedy of manners in the old fashion sense. But eventually Johnnie's gambling debts and thefts start to crowd in on him, and her. And a whole series of events occur that make Lina, well, suspicious that dear old bean Johnnie boy might just get under from under his obligations by putting her under, under the ground. Murder, murder and nothing else is surly in the air. The problem, or really two problems, though are no way, no way in hell can one make playboy Johnnie out as a murder one guy, and problem number two no way, no way in hell, once you take the glasses off, is fetching Lina slated for an early visit to the morgue. Like the title says suspicion, nothing to it but suspicion as the lovers reconcile.",4,Suspicious Minds,1345766400,"08 24, 2012",2012,2539,"['Everybody', 'well', 'knows', 'Dorothy', 'Parker', 'uttered', 'words', 'gentlemen', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'passes', 'girls', 'wear', 'glasses', 'Period', 'Well', 'period', 'hard', ""ne'er-do-"", 'well', 'besotted', 'benighted', 'be-', 'well', 'bedeviled', 'be', 'done', 'handsome', 'Johnnies', 'gents', 'who', 'are', 'slightly', 'arrears', 'rent', 'I.O.U', 'obligation', 'bookmakers', 'glasses', 'four-eyes', 'six-eyes', 'hell', 'threes', 'eyes', 'are', 'play', 'then', 'especially', 'are', 'well', 'brought', 'up', 'love-starved', 'country', 'gentry', 'daughters', 'little', 'dowry', 'hopes', 'one', 'especially', 'when', 'certain', 'girl', 'woman', 'when', 'off', 'said', 'glasses', 'well', 'ugly', 'duckling', 'turning', 'camera', 'magic', 'fetching', 'nutshell', 'lead-up', 'early', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'classic', 'review', 'Suspicion.A', 'few', 'details', 'will', 'help', 'tell', 'why', 'suspense', 'Suspicion', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'say', 'later', 'Psycho', 'etc', 'when', 'Hitchcock', 'went', 'edge', 'started', 'scare', 'bejesus', 'brave', 'pre-teen', 'teen', 'boy', 'girl', 'earth', 'NOT', 'showing', 'what', 'lurked', 'hearts', 'men', 'Johnnie', 'well-mannered', 'broke', 'Johnnie', 'played', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'who', 'else', 'would', 'fit', 'downwardly', 'mobile', 'British', 'gent', 'courts', 'one', 'plain', 'jane', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'deceived', 'was', 'first', 'glasses', 'country', 'house', 'gentry', 'meaning', 'days', 'running', 'foxes', 'et', 'al', 'daughter', 'Lina', 'played', 'Academy', 'Award-winning', 'Joan', 'Fontaine', 'over', 'are', 'married', 'illusions', 'what', 'doing', 'mainly', 'gold-digging', 'order', 'maintain', 'studious', 'avoidance', 'anything', 'smacks', 'work', 'anything', ""n't"", 'smack', 'making', 'sure', 'thing', 'bet', 'race', 'day', 'intelligent', 'enough', 'not', 'really', 'world-wary', 'more', 'few.Up', 'point', 'somewhat', 'point', 'film', 'basically', 'comedy', 'manners', 'old', 'fashion', 'sense', 'eventually', 'Johnnie', 'gambling', 'debts', 'thefts', 'start', 'crowd', 'whole', 'series', 'events', 'occur', 'make', 'Lina', 'well', 'suspicious', 'dear', 'old', 'bean', 'Johnnie', 'boy', 'might', 'just', 'get', 'obligations', 'putting', 'ground', 'Murder', 'murder', 'nothing', 'else', 'surly', 'air', 'problem', 'really', 'two', 'problems', 'are', 'way', 'way', 'hell', 'can', 'one', 'make', 'playboy', 'Johnnie', 'out', 'murder', 'one', 'guy', 'problem', 'number', 'two', 'way', 'way', 'hell', 'once', 'take', 'glasses', 'fetching', 'Lina', 'slated', 'early', 'visit', 'morgue', 'title', 'suspicion', 'nothing', 'suspicion', 'lovers', 'reconcile']",Suspicion VHS

I understand that the pedigree is high here (Hitchcock, Grant, Fontaine) and Oscar did go for this in Best Actress (Fontaine beat out a really strong and tight category) but watching this last night made me question the love for this film.Why?There are so many things wrong with this film that I&#8217;m not even sure where to begin.  First thing I&#8217;ll say is that Joan Fontaine is actually VERY good here and the most consistent and admirable aspect of the film.  I won&#8217;t trash her, since she&#8217;s actually worthy of the mention (although I&#8217;d contest that Oscar win in a heartbeat).  The rest of the film doesn&#8217;t fare too well with me.Hitchcock was the master of suspense.  We all know this.  This was a flop in tone.  I mean, the first half plays out like an awkward romantic comedy, and the second half plays out like a campy thriller that fails to ever truly latch onto fear.  In fact, the end itself is ridiculous, and for that I blame the studio (who censored the real ending and pushed for something upbeat, which degrades the rest of the film and basically sets you up for an anticlimactic conclusion) but Hitchcock&#8217;s sense of direction here is sloppy.  The tonal consistency is so all over the place that it&#8217;s embarrassing.  Then you have to factor in Cary Grant, who feels terribly miscast here.  He is too charming and jolly, but not in a manipulative way, so you never once question him.  He has vices, but a killer?  That ending feels like a betrayal, but sadly appropriate.I know that many people love this, but I don&#8217;t get it.

34988,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,0780626702,Bobby Underwood,"[53, 57]","Joan Fontaine was wonderful in this sensitive film about a shy woman who unexpectedly finds love and allows her insecurities to fuel her imagination with suspicion. She easily won the Academy Award for her performance following her fine turn the prior year in Rebecca. Based on a novel by Francis Iles, Hitchcock's second film starring Fontaine is more about love and the fear of losing it than suspense, but still has enough of his little touches to make it enjoyable as both.Joan Fontaine is the shy but wealthy Lina. Though her head is often buried in books, her heart still beats, and when she is shown a little attention by irresponsible charmer Johnnie Aysgarth (Cary Grant), who calls her monkey-face, she begins to fall in love. When she overhears her family talking about her, it hurts her deeply, and she turns to Johnnie for the romance and adventure both she and those who know her thought she'd never have.Fontaine is wonderful as she pines for the popular Johnnie to come calling again, until finally a cablegram salvages her pride in front of her skeptical family. Grant is excellent as the off-beat and fun Johnnie. When the shy Lina tells him she loves him, he realizes he feels the same and they run off and get married one rainy night.Lina tries to be happy but begins to see Johnnie in a different light when his pal Beaky (Nigel Bruce) shows up. Johnnie's gambling and irresponsible ways are off-set by his charm, however, and her faith in him is always restored, as when he buys back a family heirloom he has sold when he hits it big at the track.Lina learns through the town gossip that not only has Johnnie lost his job, but may have lost it because of theft, and decides to leave him. She is writing her note to him when Johnnie breaks in to tell her the sad news of her father's death. All is forgotten for a time as she needs Johnnie more than ever.When Johnnie's debts become serious and the sweet but slow Beaky turns up dead, in a manner Johnnie has read about in her friend's mystery novels, her insecurities allow her imagination to take the next step. And when she discovers Johnnie has attempted to borrow against her life insurance policy....Fontaine is simply marvelous in a tender and subtle performance and Cary Grant gives Johnnie just the right mix of charm and danger. The beautiful romantic score from Franz Waxman was Oscar nominated. Heather Angel has a nice part as the maid Ethel and Auriol Lee lends fine support as the mystery writer friend of Lina. Nigel Bruce, of Sherlock Holmes fame, really shines as Johnnie's pal Beaky.Though some have a problem with Hitchcock's ending, the sensitive and romantic tone of the film almost demands the ending we get.

So she decides to marry the very first man who has ever taken the slightest interest in her - Johnnie Aysgarth (Cary Grant), a charming ne'er-do-well who isn't looked upon favourably by the older members of Lina's aristocratic community.  After a whirlwind elopement, Lina and Johnnie return to the county, taking up residence in a mansion which they can barely afford.  Lina realises that Johnnie doesn't want a job when he can just as easily sit at home and live off Lina's annual income.  When Johnnie later sells off the gift that Lina's father gave them as a belated wedding present - a set of twin chairs that were family heirlooms - in order to pay his debts at the racetrack, Lina's suspicion is piqued.  Johnnie's personality seems to be slowly changing, and an ominous, darkly serious side of his temperament starts to emerge.  But is Johnnie capable of murder?Coming hot on the heels of his first big American success, ""Rebecca"", Alfred Hitchcock's SUSPICION (based on the novel ""Before the Fact"" by Anthony Berkeley) actually carries more of the flavour of his early British films.  Set in a cozy English village with lots of tweeds, fox hunts and stately country mansions, it's comfortable territory for Hitch, who perhaps knew this milieu better than any other director in Hollywood at the time.Joan Fontaine, who'd previously starred in Hitchcock's ""Rebecca"", once again fills the leading lady's shoes in this top thriller.  This time, Fontaine won the Academy Award for her exquisite performance, but I've got a feeling that the award was also partly meant as an acknowledgement of her earlier role in ""Rebecca"".This was the first time that Cary Grant had worked with Hitchcock, and the first time Grant had seriously attempted to step away from his light romantic comedy screen-persona.  The result - Grant's performance as Johnnie in SUSPICION - was one of his great performances; and of course Hitch later used Grant so brilliantly in ""Notorious"", ""North By Northwest"" and ""To Catch a Thief"".  In fact, Grant's performance in SUSPICION became so worrying for the actor that the entire ending of the film had to be re-shot, to give the character of Johnnie some sort of redemption.  Grant was so concerned that his fans would not approve of him playing a murderous rogue!This is one of the most spellbinding and utterly delightful films from Hitchcock's gallery of masterpieces.

The four films in this collection are very good films by general standards and pretty good films by Hitchcock standards.""Suspicion"" was made in the U.S., but has the look and feel of Hitchcock's British films. Joan Fontaine plays a woman who marries a charming man (Cary Grant) and doesn't realize until after their marriage that he is a perpetual adolescent - and pathological liar. But could he also be a killer? If you don't know the answer until the end, that is because Hitchcock didn't know either.""Strangers on a Train"" has a pro tennis player (Farley Granger) wanting to divorce his cheating wife so he can marry someone else. However, the cheating wife is expecting and thinks her current husband will be a great provider even if he isn't the father - divorce is out of the question. Our hero makes the mistake of discussing his problems with a sociopath on the train ride home. The sociopath (Robert Walker) suggests they perform each other's murder. You see, Walker's character comes from a wealthy family and wants his father done away with since his father has cut him off financially until he stops wasting his life. Unfortunately, Walker's character goes ahead with his end of the non-existent bargain, making everyone think that the tennis player has killed his estranged wife.""I Confess"" concerns a priest who hears the confession of a murder for which he is suspected. The priest could clear himself two ways - either by breaking his vow and revealing the killer to the police, or he could reveal his alibi - he spent the afternoon in question with a woman with whom he was involved before he became a priest. Either way out is unacceptable to the priest. Seldom seen, this has always been one of my favorites.""The Wrong Man"" has Henry Fonda as a under-capitalized musician accused of a crime. He fits the description of the robber, has no alibi, and has no money - which gives him a motive for the robbery of which he is accused. Nobody in law enforcement will believe him. This is probably the weakest film of the four although it is still pretty good.All four of these films are in the more deluxeThe Alfred Hitchcock Signature Collection (Strangers on a Train Two-Disc Edition / North by Northwest / Dial M for Murder / Foreign Correspondent / Suspicion / The Wrong Man / Stage Fright / I Confess / Mr. and Mrs. Smith).

35002,A25CZCHLNH3OMO,0780626702,Cuckoo Pine Nut,"[12, 20]","First off let me warn you that the colourised version of this movie is SO BAD. If you buy it make sure you get the black and white version. The colourised one looks like someone... a five year old child... took paint and slapped it all over the film. It's awful.Second of all let me warn you that this is NOT one of the best Hitchcock films. I find it really aggravating at moments, because Cary Grant's character drives me looney with his incessant fibbing and calling Lina ""monkeyface"". I did like the hairdo he gave her. Overall his acting is annoying here. In his other three Hitchcock films - Notorious, North by Northwest, and To Catch a Thief - he was much better. Joan Fontaine is basically the same character as she played in Rebecca, except that here it is rather tiring to watch her simper and swoon and be all sentimental over her man... In Rebecca I felt the role called for all that naive schoolgirl stuff. Here it isn't right. Ingrid Bergman could have done wonders for this movie...I can say some positive things too, however. The costumes were lovely - what I could see of them under the sloppy colourisation. The story itself was quite good as well, except of course the controversial ending... which personally I felt was just one last lie from Cary and that he did kill her after they got home.

35005,A315K47GRB024C,0780626702,Daniel C. Markel,"[45, 45]","This review is for the 2004 Warner Brothers DVD.The movie opens on train where Johnnie Aysgarth (Cary Grant) sits down in a private first class compartment with a frumpy young woman named Lina (Joan Fontaine).  Johnnie makes an excuse that he was in another first class car but couldn't stand the smoke.  When the conductor collects the tickets, he finds that Johnnie doesn't have a first class ticket or enough money to cover the difference in fare.  With some slick salesmanship, Johnnie gets Lina to pay the additional fare.  This is a foreshadowing of things to come.  They meet again and have a whirlwind romance and get married.  Lida quickly finds out that Johnnie has champaign tastes on a beer drinker's budget and uses a lot of charm and shrewd chicanery to obtain money without doing an honest day's work.  As time goes on, Lida losses trust in Johnnie but later develops legitimate fears that he may go as far as committing murder for financial gain.  This sets up the remainder of the film with plenty of suspense and drama finding out who the real Johnnie is and how far he'll go with his money scheming shenanigans.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie for many reasons, but mainly because of the two leading actors: Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine.  Not only were their individual performances terrific, but also the chemistry between the two was astounding.  The Johnnie Aysgarth character was a spellbinding enigma throughout the entire film.  Alfred Hitchcock masterfully directed the acting so that it was hard to tell if Johnnie was a charming, but irresponsible child in a man's body or deadly sociopath.  Joan Fontaine won an Oscar for her performance as the emotionally tortured wife.  Nigel Bruce also did a great job in a supporting role as Johnnie's old friend 'Beaky'.  Another wonderful thing about this movie is that there is a clear comical element to the film - especially when Johnnie assumes that his newly wedded wife has lots of money but finds out she doesn't.  The way Johnnie wiggles his way out several tight spots is a fascinating display of his creative and spontaneous ingenuity.  All in all, it's a terrific suspense film with virtually no wasted moments in the entire movie.  The ending is slightly controversial only because we find out in the commentary that the ending was change at the last minute.  Some people would have undoubtedly preferred the original ending.  I'm fine with the released version.The DVD picture quality is nearly perfect for a movie this old. The transfer is sharp and blemish-free, with only a few grainy scenes.

35007,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,0780626702,Dennis Littrell,"[5, 7]","Cary Grant (Johnnie Aysgarth) was 37 when this was released and perhaps at the pinnacle of his sexual charm (but not at the pinnacle of his career by a long shot); and Joan Fontaine (Lina Aysgarth--not ""Linda,"" as the video jacket mistakenly has it), 24, was fresh from her very fine performance in Rebecca (1940) alongside Laurence Olivier, also directed by Alfred Hitchcock, for which he garnered his only Best Picture Oscar.  I don't think this film is nearly as good.  It is saved from being something close to annoying at times only by the star power of the leads and a fine supporting cast, especially Nigel Bruce (best known perhaps as Dr. Watson in a number of Sherlock Holmes films) as Cary Grant's friend ""Beaky.""The problem with the film lies partly with the casting of Cary Grant, although not in his performance as such.  He was seen as such a valuable property by the studio that the proper ending of the film was considered inappropriate and so it was changed.  Along the way we see a lot of mixed foreshadowing so it is impossible to tell whether his character is that of a loving husband who is a bit of a rogue or a cold-blooded murderer who married Lina for her inheritance and intends to kill her.  We can see how the latter possibility might not work so well since she was only getting a subsistence allowance from the will of her father who disapproved of the marriage.  And there are all those dark scowls that Grant manufactures, somewhat awkwardly I must say, to keep us in doubt.  What is apparent is that Hitchcock had one ending in mind and then had to change it and wasn't able to redo some of the earlier scenes that worked better with the old ending.At any rate, Joan Fontaine is very good, lovely, graceful and focused.  With this performance she went one up on her older sister Olivia de Havilland by winning the Best Actress Oscar.  And it is a bit of a spicy treat to see Cary Grant as something of a heavy, at least part of the time.  For most of us, who have seen him in many films, his character has always been sterling.I must also note that some of the production seems a bit unnatural.  Grant wears his suit and tie all buttoned up even when visiting Fontaine in their bedroom (carrying the infamous glass of milk, which I understand was backlighted with a bulb inside the glass to make it almost glow).  Fontaine's Lina appears mousey and bookish at the beginning (it is suggested that she was in danger of being an old maid!) but later develops a more sophisticated style.  And I don't think Hitchcock or Grant really gave her enough cause for the sort of fear she experienced.  The final scene with its quick about-face was not entirely convincing or conclusive either.Contemporary audiences might wince at the plodding direction by Hitchcock.  They might even wonder why he decided to make a movie from such a familiar and lightly plotted tale not far removed psychologically from a romance novel.  But Hitchcock always erred on the side of giving the mass audience what he thought they wanted.  What they wanted here was Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine together romantically with some mystery and doubt along the way.",4,Slight thriller with star power,1049932800,"04 10, 2003",2003,3160,"['Cary', 'Grant', 'Johnnie', 'Aysgarth', 'was', '37', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'perhaps', 'pinnacle', 'sexual', 'charm', 'not', 'pinnacle', 'career', 'long', 'shot', 'Joan', 'Fontaine', 'Lina', 'Aysgarth', 'not', 'Linda', 'video', 'jacket', 'mistakenly', '24', 'was', 'fresh', 'very', 'fine', 'performance', 'Rebecca', '1940', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'also', 'directed', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'garnered', 'only', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscar', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'saved', 'being', 'something', 'close', 'annoying', 'times', 'only', 'star', 'power', 'leads', 'fine', 'supporting', 'cast', 'especially', 'Nigel', 'Bruce', 'best', 'known', 'perhaps', 'Dr.', 'Watson', 'number', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'films', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'friend', 'Beaky', 'problem', 'film', 'partly', 'casting', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'not', 'performance', 'such', 'was', 'seen', 'such', 'valuable', 'property', 'studio', 'proper', 'ending', 'film', 'was', 'considered', 'inappropriate', 'was', 'changed', 'way', 'see', 'lot', 'mixed', 'foreshadowing', 'impossible', 'tell', 'character', 'loving', 'husband', 'who', 'bit', 'rogue', 'cold-blooded', 'murderer', 'who', 'married', 'Lina', 'inheritance', 'kill', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'latter', 'possibility', 'might', 'not', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'was', 'only', 'getting', 'subsistence', 'allowance', 'will', 'father', 'who', 'disapproved', 'marriage', 'are', 'dark', 'scowls', 'Grant', 'somewhat', 'awkwardly', 'must', 'say', 'keep', 'doubt', 'What', 'apparent', 'Hitchcock', 'had', 'one', 'ending', 'mind', 'then', 'had', 'change', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'redo', 'earlier', 'scenes', 'worked', 'better', 'old', 'ending.At', 'rate', 'Joan', 'Fontaine', 'very', 'good', 'lovely', 'graceful', 'focused', 'performance', 'went', 'one', 'up', 'older', 'sister', 'Olivia', 'Havilland', 'winning', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'bit', 'spicy', 'treat', 'see', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'something', 'heavy', 'least', 'part', 'time', 'most', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'films', 'character', 'always', 'been', 'sterling.I', 'must', 'also', 'note', 'production', 'bit', 'unnatural', 'Grant', 'suit', 'tie', 'buttoned', 'up', 'even', 'when', 'visiting', 'Fontaine', 'bedroom', 'carrying', 'infamous', 'glass', 'milk', 'understand', 'was', 'backlighted', 'bulb', 'glass', 'make', 'almost', 'glow', 'Fontaine', 'Lina', 'mousey', 'bookish', 'beginning', 'suggested', 'was', 'danger', 'being', 'old', 'maid', 'later', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'style', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Hitchcock', 'Grant', 'really', 'gave', 'enough', 'cause', 'sort', 'fear', 'experienced', 'final', 'scene', 'quick', 'about-face', 'was', 'not', 'entirely', 'convincing', 'conclusive', 'either.Contemporary', 'audiences', 'might', 'wince', 'plodding', 'direction', 'Hitchcock', 'might', 'even', 'wonder', 'why', 'decided', 'make', 'movie', 'such', 'familiar', 'lightly', 'plotted', 'tale', 'not', 'far', 'removed', 'psychologically', 'romance', 'novel', 'Hitchcock', 'always', 'erred', 'side', 'giving', 'mass', 'audience', 'what', 'thought', 'wanted', 'What', 'wanted', 'here', 'was', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Joan', 'Fontaine', 'together', 'romantically', 'mystery', 'doubt', 'way']",Suspicion VHS

35010,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,0780626702,Dr. James Gardner,"[8, 12]","""Suspicion"" is a 1941 crime drama from Alfred Hitchcock, starring Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine with Nigel Bruce, Cedric Hardwicke, and Leo G. Carroll. It was based on a 1932 novel ""Before the Fact"" by Anthony Berkeley who is considered the ""father of the psychological suspense novel.""By 1941 Cary Grant (1904-86) was a major star. He became well known for films like ""She Done Him Wrong"" (1933) and ""Sylvia Scarlett"" (1935). But Mae West took credit for ""She Done Him Wrong"" and ""Sylvia Scarlett"" was a box office flop, and it wouldn't be until ""The Awful Truth"" (1937) that he would emerge as a star.  Though generally well regarded (AFI rates him 2nd greatest male star ever), Grant never won a major acting award and received only 2 Oscar nominations in more than 70 film outings. I liked him best in ""Gunga Din"" (1939), ""His Girl Friday"" (1940) and ""The Philadelphia Story"" (1940). This was the first of 4 films he made with Hitchcock, who said of him - ""the only actor I ever loved in my whole life"". Bear in mind, Hitchcock was fond of saying that actors should be treated as cattle.Joan Fontaine (1917) co-stars as Grant's  wife. She's the younger sister of film great Olivia de Havilland and was a star in her own right. Fontaine was nominated for an Oscar 3 times, and won for this film - the only actor to ever win an Oscar in a Hitchcock film. She worked with Hitch the previous year in his American debut, ""Rebecca"", and among her other notable films were ""The Constant Nymph"" (1943), ""Jane Eyre"" (1944), ""Ivanhoe"" (1952), and ""Island in the Sun"" (1957).Nigel Bruce (1895-1953) is best known as Dr. Watson  in all 14 of the Rathbone Holmes films. Bruce had quite a distinguished career apart from the Holmes' films, appearing in many British films like ""Treasure Island"" (1934), ""The Scarlet Pimpernel"" (1934), ""Charge of the Light Brigade"" (1936), and ""Kidnapped"" (1938). He worked with Hitchcock in ""Rebecca"" (1940) and ""Suspicion"" (1941). Bruce plays a friend of Grant and he gives one of his most remarkable performances ever.Cedric Hardwicke's (1893-1964) strong voice and stony appearance graced nearly 100 films. He played the evil bishop in ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" (1939), Dr. Livingstone in ""Stanley and Livingstone"" (1939), and King Arthur in ""A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court"" (1949). I remember him best as the Pharaoh in ""The Ten Commandments"" (1956). Hardwick worked with Hitchcock again in ""Rope"" (1948). He plays Fontaine's father.Leo G. Carroll (1892-1972) appeared in 6 Hitchcock films, an accomplishment exceeded by only one other actor - Clare Greet who appeared in 7. Carroll is best known for his TV series ""Topper"" (1953-6) and ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."" (1964-8) but he gave excellent performances in more than 50 films, including ""A Christmas Carol"" (1938), Wuthering Heights"" (1938), ""The House on 92nd Street"" (1945), and ""The Desert Fox"" (1951). Don't sneeze or you'll miss Leo. He plays Grant's cousin.Franz Waxman (1906-67) provides the musical score. Waxman was nominated for an Oscar 10 times and won twice (""A Place in the Sun"" and ""Sunset Blvd""). He was a favorite of Hitchcock who used him in 4 films and earned 2 of his Oscar nominations (""Rebecca"" and ""Suspicion""). At times Waxman's music could be overbearing (e.g., ""Objective Burma""), but when he was good he was great. Waxman is good in this film, using the music to heighten the tension without distracting from the action, and playfully altering Strauss' waltz to fit Grant's behavior.The film did well with critics and the public. It was the 15th highest grossing film of the year, but garnered only one Oscar. 1941 was a terrific year for films - ""Citizen Kane"", ""The Maltese Falcon"", Sergeant York"", ""How Green Was My Valley"", Meet John Doe"", ""Buck Privates"", ""They Died with Their Boots On"", ""The Sea Wolf"" ""High Sierra"", ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"", and ""A Yank in the RAF"".Personally I find the film lacking. The cheap sets and special effects that Hitchcock was so accustomed to using in his work at British International/Gaumont are out of place in a 1941 American production, even if it was RKO. And bear in mind that ""Suspicion"" was produced by Hitch, so he couldn't blame Selznick as he was wont to do.In addition, the tone of the film is shaky. It begins as a romantic comedy (see his ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" that came out at the same time) and moves awkwardly into a suspense thriller, or is it really a film about a woman's descent into paranoia. The inability to keep his eye on the mark is undoubtedly caused by the casting of Cary Grant into a film that calls for him to play a psychopathic degenerate gambler to kill his wife. The film follows the book reasonably well with some notable exceptions - Grant's adultery, his involvement in the death of Fontaine's father,  and the ending.  But by taking the threads of the book and removing significant thematic material, we are left with an unsettling story. In later years Hitch claimed that he was forced to accept these changes, but his biographer Donald Spoto claims he was fully aware of the changes.Fans of Hitchcock or Grant can find many many better films to watch.FWIW - Look for Hitch about 48 minutes into the film, mailing a letter. And the dog you see is actually Hitch's own dog",2,"Grant as a villain.

35011,A2TV6SBCWT7P8S,0780626702,ehakus,"[7, 7]","Suspicion is a great film, as are most Alfred Hitchcock films. It features two talented classic stars, Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine, and is very suspenseful and chilling. Although this film could have been much better had the ending been different, it is still quite good as it is, especially because of Grant's amazing (but much ignored) performance as Johnny.Essentially, Suspicion is the story of a bookish, shy English girl (Joan Fontaine) who falls in love with a charming but irresponsible man named Johnny (Cary Grant). As the film progresses, the audience begins to suspect Johnny of more than simply gambling and being irresponsible, which raises the question - are the suspicions justified or is ""Monkey Face"" (what Johnny calls his wife) just being paranoid?The film progresses, building to a seemingly unforgettable conclusion - but then suddenly, and very unconvincingly, Johnny is vindicated! In my opinion, this ending, while still making Suspicion a great film and enjoyable to watch, really detracts from the overall effect. I feel that Hitchcock's original ending, in which Johnny gives his wife the poisoned milk, she drinks it, but writes a letter beforehand saying that she knew he was going to murder her, would have been far more effective. Sadly, however, because of Grant's matinee-idol appeal, the studio did not allow Hitchcock to cast him as a murderer (they feared it would hurt his popularity).Anyhow, even though it is frustrating that Grant was so constrained by the studios and by his own persona, Suspicion is still a good film as it is, and is totally worth seeing!",4,Could have been better but still good...,1029715200,"08 19, 2002",2002,1600,"['Suspicion', 'great', 'film', 'are', 'most', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'films', 'two', 'talented', 'classic', 'stars', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Joan', 'Fontaine', 'very', 'suspenseful', 'chilling', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'had', 'ending', 'been', 'different', 'still', 'quite', 'good', 'especially', 'Grant', 'amazing', 'much', 'ignored', 'performance', 'Johnny.Essentially', 'Suspicion', 'story', 'bookish', 'shy', 'English', 'girl', 'Joan', 'Fontaine', 'who', 'love', 'charming', 'irresponsible', 'man', 'named', 'Johnny', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'film', 'audience', 'suspect', 'Johnny', 'more', 'simply', 'gambling', 'being', 'irresponsible', 'question', 'are', 'suspicions', 'justified', 'Monkey', 'Face', 'what', 'Johnny', 'wife', 'just', 'being', 'paranoid', 'film', 'building', 'seemingly', 'unforgettable', 'conclusion', 'then', 'suddenly', 'very', 'unconvincingly', 'Johnny', 'vindicated', 'opinion', 'ending', 'still', 'making', 'Suspicion', 'great', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'really', 'overall', 'effect', 'feel', 'Hitchcock', 'original', 'ending', 'Johnny', 'wife', 'poisoned', 'milk', 'letter', 'beforehand', 'saying', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'murder', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'more', 'effective', 'Sadly', 'however', 'Grant', 'matinee-idol', 'appeal', 'studio', 'did', 'not', 'allow', 'Hitchcock', 'cast', 'murderer', 'feared', 'would', 'hurt', 'popularity', '.Anyhow', 'even', 'frustrating', 'Grant', 'was', 'so', 'constrained', 'studios', 'own', 'persona', 'Suspicion', 'still', 'good', 'film', 'totally', 'worth', 'seeing']",Suspicion VHS

Here's the break down:.Suspicion:  Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine play newly married folk when he sweeps into her live and sweeps her off her feet.  But it doesn't take long for her to begin to suspect that he is a lair, a phoney and a murderer -- Which she fears she will be next!  I give this one a four of five.  Chiefly because I detest how many women in films are portrayed at that time and I KNOW they were not really that way.Strangers On A Train:  Robert Walker and Farley Granger play a wealthy, psychotic playboy and a tennis pro.  When they meet on a train one hatches a double murder scheme that the tennis pro dismisses as wishful thinking -- But then he quickly learns it is much more than that!  I give this five of five stars, but, a little strained to be honest.  Mostly because of the time is so outdated and it is apparent at times.The Wrong Man:  A falsely accused man (Henry Fonda) may crumble beneath the immense weight of the legal system -- His wife (Vera Miles) does.  He is a base player charged with a lookalike's crimes --  At least Hitchcock thought they looked alike, I don't.  Based on a true story -- Which always makes me wonder how much is true and how much is story.  I needn't tell you the upsetting part for me was Vera Miles' character crumbling so easily -- apparently she was on the verge well before this.  Fonda always seems to walk effeminately to me and really that adds to the lack of credibility in these witnesses accusations when you learn the real culprit is this sinister macho man.  Nevertheless, I give this one a five of five I adore Fonda's work if not his walk.I Confess:  Not sure why this is called this but I do love it.  Montgomery Clift, Anne Baxter and Karl Malden are the primary actors in this thriller of mistaken identity.  When a priest (Clift) hears a confession of murder he end's up being a suspect when a woman's (Baxter) statement to an inspector (Malden) leads them directly to him.  Still charged he won't give up the party who really did it.  Five of five for this one too!  I LOVE Clift so!

35020,A7Y6AVS576M03,0780626702,gobirds2,"[0, 0]","I CONFESS is one of my favorite Alfred Hitchcokk films. On the surface there is the story of a Catholic priest, Father Michael Logan, who hears the confession of a man (Otto Keller) who has committed a murder. Otto Keller works at the rectory and Father Logan recognizes him. Father Logan cannot reveal what he has been told in the confessional by the the vows of his faith. In a strange twist of events, it becomes clear that Father Logan had some dealings with the murdered man and Father Logan becomes the prime suspect of the murder. It is a very good story and the web gets very complex. What impressed me was Montgomery Clift's performance as Father Logan. It is very reverent, very thoughtful and very realistic. Montgomery Clift as Father Logan is certainly a tormented man. Karl Malden as Inspector Larrue is equally impressive. The scenes between Montgomery Clift and Karl Malden are very tense and intense. Their parts, their confrontational dialogues are well written. My background is Catholic and I understand and accept the sanctity of the confessional. It is a real dilemma in one way for father Logan since he is being accused of the murder. I think this is a great film and one of Hitchcock's best. The Quebec setting and Robert Burks' beautiful black & white photography is very haunting, as haunted as Father Logan is of the position he has been placed in under the eyes of God. Dimitri Tiomkin's score also captures the beauty of Quebec and also Father Logan's torment. I think this is Montgomery Clift's best performance ever. It is sort of a forgotten film and that just adds to its haunting beauty and the torment that faith sometimes reaches out asks us to examine our own beliefs.STRANGERS ON A TRAIN is yet another disturbing study in murder where a mentally imbalanced (Robert Walker) man wants to switch murders with a tennis pro (Farley Granger) that he accidentally bumps into on a train. Honestly, I think this film may be the most shockingly bizarre of all Hitchcock's films. Dimitri Tiomkin's score is haunting yet full of energy as good must outwit evil. Robert Walker's performance is very unsettling. It is interesting how Hitchcock manipulates your loyalties between the two men.SUSPICION has always been one of my favorite Hitchcock films. Cary Grant gives an amazing performance. Is he really trying to kill off his wife or not?  The zany Cary Grant is so likeable one moment, yet his actions seem sinister as he pops in and out of scenes and the viewer constantly wonders where he is off to.THE WRONG MAN is a devastating film, shot in semi-documentary style. Henry Fonda is falsely accused of a crime and it is clearly a state of mistaken identity. This film takes you through all the emotional trials and tribulations he and his wife go through. This film also seemed challenging for composer Bernard Herrmann, yet he delivers an exceptionally interesting score counterbalancing the visual narrative.",5,Four Very Good Hitchcock Choices,1381881600,"10 16, 2013",2013,2943,"['CONFESS', 'one', 'favorite', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcokk', 'films', 'surface', 'story', 'Catholic', 'priest', 'Father', 'Michael', 'Logan', 'who', 'confession', 'man', 'Otto', 'Keller', 'who', 'committed', 'murder', 'Otto', 'Keller', 'rectory', 'Father', 'Logan', 'Father', 'Logan', 'can', 'not', 'reveal', 'what', 'been', 'told', 'confessional', 'vows', 'faith', 'strange', 'twist', 'events', 'clear', 'Father', 'Logan', 'had', 'dealings', 'murdered', 'man', 'Father', 'Logan', 'prime', 'suspect', 'murder', 'very', 'good', 'story', 'web', 'very', 'complex', 'What', 'impressed', 'was', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'performance', 'Father', 'Logan', 'very', 'reverent', 'very', 'thoughtful', 'very', 'realistic', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'Father', 'Logan', 'certainly', 'tormented', 'man', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'Inspector', 'Larrue', 'equally', 'impressive', 'scenes', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'are', 'very', 'tense', 'intense', 'parts', 'confrontational', 'dialogues', 'are', 'well', 'written', 'background', 'Catholic', 'understand', 'accept', 'sanctity', 'confessional', 'real', 'dilemma', 'one', 'way', 'father', 'Logan', 'being', 'accused', 'murder', 'think', 'great', 'film', 'one', 'Hitchcock', 'best', 'Quebec', 'setting', 'Robert', 'Burks', 'beautiful', 'black', 'white', 'photography', 'very', 'haunting', 'as', 'haunted', 'Father', 'Logan', 'position', 'been', 'placed', 'eyes', 'God', 'Dimitri', 'Tiomkin', 'score', 'also', 'beauty', 'Quebec', 'also', 'Father', 'Logan', 'torment', 'think', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'best', 'performance', 'ever', 'sort', 'forgotten', 'film', 'just', 'haunting', 'beauty', 'torment', 'faith', 'sometimes', 'out', 'asks', 'examine', 'own', 'beliefs.STRANGERS', 'ON', 'A', 'TRAIN', 'yet', 'disturbing', 'study', 'murder', 'where', 'mentally', 'imbalanced', 'Robert', 'Walker', 'man', 'switch', 'murders', 'tennis', 'pro', 'Farley', 'Granger', 'accidentally', 'train', 'Honestly', 'think', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'shockingly', 'bizarre', 'Hitchcock', 'films', 'Dimitri', 'Tiomkin', 'score', 'haunting', 'yet', 'full', 'energy', 'good', 'must', 'outwit', 'evil', 'Robert', 'Walker', 'performance', 'very', 'unsettling', 'interesting', 'how', 'Hitchcock', 'loyalties', 'two', 'men.SUSPICION', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'Hitchcock', 'films', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'amazing', 'performance', 'really', 'trying', 'kill', 'off', 'wife', 'not', 'zany', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'so', 'likeable', 'one', 'moment', 'yet', 'actions', 'seem', 'sinister', 'scenes', 'viewer', 'constantly', 'wonders', 'where', 'to.THE', 'WRONG', 'MAN', 'devastating', 'film', 'shot', 'semi-documentary', 'style', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'falsely', 'accused', 'crime', 'clearly', 'state', 'mistaken', 'identity', 'film', 'emotional', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'wife', 'go', 'film', 'also', 'seemed', 'challenging', 'composer', 'Bernard', 'Herrmann', 'yet', 'exceptionally', 'interesting', 'score', 'counterbalancing', 'visual', 'narrative']",Suspicion VHS

35022,AAIL33CYCT47J,0780626702,Gregory Baird,"[10, 10]","""Suspicion"" finds Joan Fontaine in the Academy Award-winning role of Lina McLaidlaw, a wealthy but shy young lady whose parents have lost hope of her finding a husband.  That all changes when she meets the enormously charming Johnnie Aysgarth, who is played with a devilish ambiguity by Cary Grant.  Are his intentions pure, or is he a cad?  Alas, after the two are married, Lina's suspicions about her new husband become far more sinister than that.  He turns out to be a compulsive liar, deeply in debt, and morally suspect; all of which leads Lina to the frightening conclusion that his cold-bloodedness may extend to murder -- first of his best friend Beaky, and then of her.The story follows the conventions of an early twentieth century mystery novel -- specifically, it feels like something that the venerable Agatha Christie would have cooked up.  There is even a female character that earns a living as a mystery writer, whose conversations about the plotlines of her own books add weight to the parallel.  But what is so ingenius about the plot is that it goes beyond mere convention; imagine that you suddenly find yourself at the center of one of those mystery novels and you will understand something of the paranoia and bewilderment that Lina feels when she comes to believe that that is exactly what has happened to her.  But is she right about Johnnie?  Is her titular suspicion that he will try to kill her justified, or is she crazy?Sadly, this question would be better explored in a later film by Hitchcock: 1954'sRear Window (Collector's Edition).  It is explored even more deeply in two classic chillers by Ira Levin:Rosemary's BabyandThe Stepford Wives, and also by their subsequent film adaptations.  What goes wrong in ""Suspicion"" has to do with the misogynist characterization of Lina and the cheap Hollywood ending that the film slaps on.  The latter is no fault of Hitchcock's -- the documentary in the special features explains that he was forced to change the bleaker climax by censors -- but those who take issue with the former will find themselves agreeing with critics who express distaste with Hitchcock's portrayals of women in his films.  Lina's bland acceptance of Johnnie's faults could be passed off as a product of the times, but when she fails to do anything about her suspicions that he is plotting to kill her it is nothing short of ridiculous.  Ironically, the Hollywood ending comes to the rescue here because it accidentally imbues her with a tiny degree of strength that the original climax would never have mustered.Still, ""Suspicion"" is a remarkably well made film with excellent performances from Fontaine, Grant, and Nigel Bruce as Johnnie's friend Beaky.  The directing is, of course, excellent -- though to get a full appreciation of what went in to it you should really watch the 30 minute documentary on the film as well.  An example of one fascinating tidbit gleaned from it: in order to make a suspicious glass of milk that Johnnie brings to Lina stand out, Hitchcock contrived to place a light bulb in the glass -- giving it an eerie glow.  Whatever your opinion of Hitchcock the man, one has to admit that Hitchcock the director was nothing short of genius.",4,"Twisty, Entertaining and Diabolical -- In Short, Pure Hitchcock",1176336000,"04 12, 2007",2007,3216,"['Suspicion', 'Joan', 'Fontaine', 'Academy', 'Award-winning', 'role', 'Lina', 'McLaidlaw', 'wealthy', 'shy', 'young', 'lady', 'parents', 'have', 'lost', 'hope', 'finding', 'husband', 'changes', 'when', 'enormously', 'charming', 'Johnnie', 'Aysgarth', 'who', 'played', 'devilish', 'ambiguity', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Are', 'intentions', 'pure', 'cad', 'Alas', 'two', 'are', 'married', 'Lina', 'suspicions', 'new', 'husband', 'become', 'far', 'more', 'sinister', 'out', 'be', 'compulsive', 'liar', 'deeply', 'debt', 'morally', 'suspect', 'Lina', 'frightening', 'conclusion', 'cold-bloodedness', 'may', 'extend', 'murder', 'first', 'best', 'friend', 'Beaky', 'then', 'her.The', 'story', 'conventions', 'early', 'twentieth', 'century', 'mystery', 'novel', 'specifically', 'something', 'venerable', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'would', 'have', 'cooked', 'up', 'even', 'female', 'character', 'living', 'mystery', 'writer', 'conversations', 'plotlines', 'own', 'books', 'add', 'weight', 'parallel', 'what', 'so', 'ingenius', 'plot', 'mere', 'convention', 'imagine', 'suddenly', 'find', 'center', 'one', 'mystery', 'novels', 'will', 'understand', 'something', 'paranoia', 'bewilderment', 'Lina', 'feels', 'when', 'believe', 'exactly', 'what', 'happened', 'right', 'Johnnie', 'titular', 'suspicion', 'will', 'try', 'kill', 'justified', 'crazy', 'Sadly', 'question', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'explored', 'later', 'film', 'Hitchcock', ""1954'sRear"", 'Window', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'explored', 'even', 'more', 'deeply', 'two', 'classic', 'chillers', 'Ira', 'Levin', 'Rosemary', 'BabyandThe', 'Stepford', 'Wives', 'also', 'subsequent', 'film', 'adaptations', 'What', 'wrong', 'Suspicion', 'do', 'misogynist', 'characterization', 'Lina', 'cheap', 'Hollywood', 'ending', 'film', 'slaps', 'latter', 'fault', 'Hitchcock', 'documentary', 'special', 'features', 'was', 'forced', 'change', 'bleaker', 'climax', 'censors', 'who', 'take', 'issue', 'former', 'will', 'find', 'agreeing', 'critics', 'who', 'express', 'distaste', 'Hitchcock', 'portrayals', 'women', 'films', 'Lina', 'bland', 'acceptance', 'Johnnie', 'faults', 'could', 'be', 'passed', 'off', 'product', 'times', 'when', 'do', 'anything', 'suspicions', 'plotting', 'kill', 'nothing', 'short', 'ridiculous', 'Ironically', 'Hollywood', 'ending', 'rescue', 'here', 'accidentally', 'tiny', 'degree', 'strength', 'original', 'climax', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'mustered.Still', 'Suspicion', 'remarkably', 'well', 'made', 'film', 'excellent', 'performances', 'Fontaine', 'Grant', 'Nigel', 'Bruce', 'Johnnie', 'friend', 'Beaky', 'directing', 'course', 'excellent', 'get', 'full', 'appreciation', 'what', 'went', 'should', 'really', 'watch', '30', 'minute', 'documentary', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'example', 'one', 'fascinating', 'tidbit', 'gleaned', 'order', 'make', 'suspicious', 'glass', 'milk', 'Johnnie', 'Lina', 'stand', 'out', 'Hitchcock', 'contrived', 'place', 'light', 'bulb', 'glass', 'giving', 'eerie', 'glow', 'opinion', 'Hitchcock', 'man', 'one', 'admit', 'Hitchcock', 'director', 'was', 'nothing', 'short', 'genius']",Suspicion VHS

Fontaine does an excellent job playing the madly in love wife who strongly suspects her husband wants to kill her and collect the money from her insurance policy.  The DVD comes with a documentary that details the production of the film, and the controversy surrounding the original ending of ""Suspicion,"" which had to be changed at the very last minute.  The movie you see on the screen was heading towards a different ending, so the one it has now seems somewhat out of place.  But Fontaine's acting saves the new ending with a beautiful performance and, eventually, winning her an Oscar because of it.  As far as the narrative goes, if the original ending were to have made the final cut, the film would have had a similar conclusion like that of ""The Paradine Case,""  where the surprise would have been muted and the film would have lost its overall strength.  ""The Paradine Case"" falls flat in the end--ruining what was a really well acted film.  ""Suspicion,"" with the change of its ending, brought a different conclusion that, even though the denouement appears to be slapdash and out of place, at least salvages the story as a whole rather than sink it.

Hitchcock plays this theme over and over and it never gets boring. This time suave and handsome Cary Grant is the husband and lovely Joan Fontaine is the troubled wife.Shy and bookish Lina McLaidlaw (Joan Fontaine) is the apple of her parents' eyes even though they seem to imagine her as an eternal spinster. Womanizer Johnnie Aysgarth (Cary Grant) enters her life and Lina is overwhelmed by her love for and attraction to Johnnie. After a very brief courtship, the two are married and set up a home together. Here is the magic of Hitchcock as he slowly weaves a story of deceit and eventual mistrust. Mistrust leads to suspicion. Lina quickly learns that Johnnie is broke and lives on credit and an occasional win at the horse races. His schemes and lies are constantly brought to life and it is clear that Johnnie is a compulsive liar. Enter Johnnie's best friend Beaky (Nigel Bruce) who confirms Lina's fears about her husband. Beaky becomes a rock of stability for Lina as more and more of Johnnie's lies come to the surface.Our story movies rather story as Johnnie is constantly caught in some scheme. He's not adverse to secretly selling family heirlooms to make some funny, yet, in the end, the heirlooms are back home and Johnnie is back in Lina's trust. Much later in the film, are suspicions raised that Johnnie is planning to commit a murder. Has there already been a murder and is Lina next? Her fears overwhelm him and the last few minutes of the film are pure Hitchcock suspense.Grant's movie star perfect looks make him an ideal Johnnie. Women flock around him. He could have his choice of any wealthy heiress, yet he chose only a modestly wealthy Lina. Johnnie must really love her, Lina surmises.There is so much fun in a classic Hitchcock film. His early movies were made on film sets and it's fun to watch SUSPICION knowing that everything, save for a few brief establishing shots, were filmed indoors on a set. The quaint village and countryside were created on an indoor movie set. Hitchcock genius shined brightly because of the great stories and wonderful actors.

Personally, I think the ending is good and appropriate, although it is a little abruptly presented.  Joan Fontaine is quite good (I don't  usually care for her performances) as a quiet, reserved English woman who  marries the irresponsible Cary Grant, displeasing her father who assumed  she would make a wiser choice.  As time goes along, she begins to suspect  that her husband may have killed someone and might be looking at her as his  next victim.  The inclusion of a character that writes murder mysteries  adds to the mood and suspense.  Grant is very effective as her husband,  Johnny, and it's unusual to see him in a basically threatening,  unsympathetic role.

They marry, against the wishes of her family.As soon as Lina gets home from her happy honeymoon, she starts to realize that Johnnie has severe character flaws: thieving, lying, and gambling, for a start. There is one scene in which a rich Mrs. Newsham--who was Johnnie's companion on the occasion that Johnnie and Lina first met--speaks to Lina in such a sneering way that you KNOW she is Johnnie's jealous lover, and I don't merely mean ""ex""!So what does Johnnie do while Lina spends her time worrying? More shenanigans are on their way. The Aysgarths acquire a house guest, an old friend of Johnnie's. The guest, ""Beaky"" Thwaite (Nigel Bruce, who hams it up to the point of orgasm) is a catalyst for Lina's worst (or so SHE thinks!) possible nightmare. The clueless Beaky drinks brandy even though he's so sensitive to it that a mere sip comes close to killing him. And, on account of a joint investment he and Johnnie have made, it's to Johnnie's advantage to kill him. Lina worries herself crazy over Beaky's possible fate. In due course, she suspects Johnnie of wanting to bump her off for the life insurance.

35034,AT04V4H3AO3T5,0780626702,Jeremy W. Forstadt,"[6, 8]","Alfred Hitchcock's second film after being brought to America by David O. Selznick was SUSPICION, which he made while on loan to RKO Pictures. As in his first Hollywood flick, REBECCA, he put Joan Fontaine to very good use and ultimately these two films made her into a star.Fontaine won the Best Actress Academy Award for her portrayal of Lina McLaidlaw, a bookish and innocent (but wealthy) young woman who gets swept off her feet by the caddish Johnnie Aysgarth (Cary Grant). After their quick courtship and marriage against her father's wishes, Lina begins to see Johnnie for who he really is--a penniless leech--but she naively continues to love him nonetheless. Johnnie's charm is ostensible, yet his irresponsible ways are increasingly becoming inexcusable. Lina's trust eventually gives way to suspicion when she begins to believe that he might go to any length to pay off his mounting debts.Hitchcock masterfully builds suspense in this movie and manages to maintain it for the duration of the picture. The movie's only flaw is its tacked-on and seemingly contrived final scene which, we are told, was due either to Mr. Grant's popularity during these years or to the existence of the Production Code in effect in Hollywood at that time. Hitchcock wanted a darker ending but, as we see here, he lost that battle. However, he did not give in as completely as some would have us believe. The ending remains ambiguous enough to allow us to project either a happy or a sinister conclusion according to our own sensibilities.SUSPICION is classic Hitchcock. Grant and Fontaine turn in masterful performances and Nigel Bruce is irresistible as the dimwitted and loveable ""Beaky,"" Johnnie's old chum. The flawed ending prevents placing SUSPICION at the top of any list of Hitchcock's achievements, but it is a fine film nevertheless and I can only give it my highest recommendation.Jeremy W.

35037,A22BPC7LRSGSYQ,0780626702,Joker,"[1, 1]","So much has already been written about this movie that I just want to say a few things rather than write about the plot, etc.  Read other reviews for that information.Suspicion (1941) is an Alfred Hitchcock suspense thriller/romance/comedy that stars Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine.  This movie holds the distinction of being the only Alfred Hitchcock movie in which an actor won an Oscar for their performance.  Hitchcock made so many great movies with great acting performances from top stars spanning so many years, so I simply find it amazing that only one acting performance won an Oscar out of all the movies he made.  Joan Fontaine was great in this movie and deserved the Oscar, but I also think she deserved an Oscar for her performance as the second Mrs. de Winter in Rebecca (1940) a year earlier.  I also think Judith Anderson should have won Best Supporting Actress in Rebecca as well.  Oh well.Some people have a hard time accepting Cary Grant playing a villain in this movie.  When people think of Cary Grant, they think of him playing a certain type of character other than a villain.  Myself, I don't have any problem with him playing a villain because what it comes down to is something very simple -- you just need to realize he's an ACTOR, and actors are supposed to be VERSATILE, not one dimensional.  Really good actors have the ability to play all kinds of different roles, and really it comes down to just separating what he's done in other movies from what he did in Suspicion and ditching any preconceived view you have of him.  It's that simple.This is one of those movies that starts a little slow but gets better and more suspenseful as it progresses.  You just need to be patient and let things unfold.  So many of Hitchcock's black and white movies from the 1940s are great movies but are often overlooked in favor of the movies from his prime, which I see as the period of time from about 1951-1964.This DVD contains a 21-minute documentary on the movie and the theatrical trailer.Overall, this is a good movie with a great acting performance from Joan Fontaine.  I recommend it highly.  If you're new to Hitchcock movies, I recommend starting with one of his bigger classics from his prime years, such as Strangers On A Train (1951), Rear Window (1954), Vertigo (1958), North By Northwest (1959), Psycho (1960), The Birds (1963), and Marnie (1964).  If you want to start in the 1940s, I of course recommend Suspicion as well as Rebecca (1940), Saboteur (1942), Shadow Of A Doubt (1943), Lifeboat (1944), Spellbound (1945), Notorious (1946), and Rope (1948).",4,Only one acting Oscar.

35038,A3BU6QT97HMF,0780626702,Joseph Hart,"[5, 7]","I loved it.  True, as one reviewer pointed out, there were shades of Rebecca in it.  But Fontaine certainly deserved her Oscar.  I'd have given her two of them for this.  In fact, every actor in it was perfect and excellent.  Okay.  Why did I only give it 4 stars?  Because (like Rebecca), Hitchcock spends nearly an entire hour (the whole thing (thank god) is only 99 minutes long) setting the stage, establishing with incredible repetition the rationale for Fontaine's fears and suspicions (plus the courtship was a little tedius too, I thought).  But when Watson comes into the plot, it is terrific!  Of course you know (or will if you read these other reviews) how it will end.  But I have never seen Grant play a malevolent, sinister character before, and he did it wonderfully.  And I've never seen him play someone so inherently unlikeable before.  As my friend said, he was ""obnoxious.""  And as another reviewer said, I wouldn't love someone who called me ""monkey face""!  Again like Rebecca, the last 20 minutes or so were breathtaking, fascinating.  I loved the ending.  I thought it was perfectly done (though unfortunately with Hitchcock's customary fake outdoor shots), all the loose ends were tied up and everything fell into place.  And I liked the very end just before the screen went blank (I won't say what it was), I thought it was perfect, wordless.  However, I read (you can too) the complete description of Hitchcock's original ending in another review.  I don't know now which I prefer, both I think are perfect.

I must say she is superb playing such docile doormats - but could she play anything else?  Question - did she win the Oscar for her acting prowess or because the members of the academy felt sorry fpr the character?As for Grant's character - how anyone in their right mind could find this cad charming is beyond me.  It is a trap of sorts - if you fall for Johnnie Boy as she does does it indicate you have the same weaknesses she suffers from?  The ending is tacked on and refutes everything we have been watching up to that time.  The ending is not a twist as in ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""The Usual Suspects"" - it is a con, it is a cheat and it is cheap.  Hitchcock must have hated having to bend to studio pressure.  Yet even had the film been released with its original (and substantially more realistic) ending some problems would still exist.One of the many problems with the script's credibility is Johnnie's attraction to Fontaine's character.  Money is not the motive, as she asserts other eligible women he could have married have much more money than she does.  One might answer that he marries her BECAUSE of her docility, that it is because he knows that she will allow him to take advantage of her - but that answer is belied by the tacked on ending.  She marries him not knowing he has no income.  Really? Johnnie ignores her for months on end and then appears claiming he loves her madly and she, poor pathetic thing believes it. Really?  Had Fontaine's part been played by a callow 18 year old her actions (or lack of same) might be excusable, but Ms. Fontaine was well over thirty in 1941.  Was the script written by a mysogynist?  It certainly seems to have been written by someone not at all acquainted with human nature or, for that matter, humans.  It is too formulaic - every bit of verisimilitude is sacrificed for the plot - and even that is mangled in the last few minutes.Watch Grant's face as his closest friend almost dies - pure malevolence.  Watch Grant's face as he hears he gets nothing in his father in law's will - cold-blooded anger.  Listen to Grant's tone of voice when he chides his simpering wife for interfering in his business - self-righteous indignation.  Any man who insists on calling the woman he supposedly loves ""Monkey Face"" is not loving at all, but cruelly mocking; and any woman who puts up with not being called ANYTHING endearing (let alone her name) and stands for it is to be pitied and wondered at.  It is quite one thing for a character to have many sides to his personality; it is quite another for a character to become someone else entirely (smacks of schizophrenia).  The happy ending has not been earned.  If you enjoy watching the doings of a masochist married to a merry sadist who then turns out to be someone else entirely you will rave about this film. Imagine Uncle Charlie in ""Shadow of a Doubt"" showing himself to be a kind, benevolent soul and his niece being a cold-hearted murderer at movie's end and you get the idea.

In SUSPICION, Hitchcock presents a view of good guy Cary Crant as a leering, lying, cad who may be guilty of even worse criminal behavior.Grant is Johnnie, who opens as the Cary Grant his fans have always known: suave, handsome, dashing.  Joan Fontaine is Lina, a rather bookish frump who nevertheless catches Johnnie's eye. Early on, Johnnie's interest in Lina is at least partly based on her family fortune.  When the audience sees Grant going against type by playing the caddish Johnnie, they can see that behind the smiling eyes and suave grin lay a twist that no one would have believed.  Director Hitchcock slowly builds up the character of Johnnie by innuendo.  At each step of the way, Lina hears and sees the implied charges, but she always tries to find a rational answer that does not point toward what the audience sees as the inevitable truth.  Nigel Bruce as Beaky, a childhood chum of Johnnie's, supplies the same innocent charm that he displayed earlier as Dr. Watson in the Sherlock Holmes series.  Here as Beaky, Bruce reinforces the twin nature of Johnnie: that is one must accept his negative side if one is to as readily accept his positive.  With each revelation, first from Beaky, then from Johnnie's employer (Leo G. Carroll), the mounting evidence accrues to convince Lina that her husband is guilty of a series of crimes ranging from theft, to deception, to murder.  The famous scene in which Johnnie brings Lina a glass of glowing milk indelibly etches in the audience's collective mind the conviction that Johnnie is indeed the creep that he appears to be.Unfortunately, Hitchcock could not allow the reputation of Cary Grant to be tarnished by ending the movie on the affirmation of a guilt that he had spent the better part of two hours so carefully constructing.  The turn about of the closing scene leaves the viewer gasping in disbelief.  Even if that viewer accepts the glib explanation of Johnnie of his true motivation, then this acceptance still leaves him as the same cad he was at the start of the film.  Still, Joan Fontaine as Lina managed to snare an Oscar for best actress.  SUSPICION is the kind of quality film that except for the last minute manages to engage the viewer in a race against time during which one woman must balance her feelings against mounting suspicions against a man whose charm is source both of her love and her deepest fears.",4,A Suspicion that this Could Have Been More Memorable,1070755200,"12 7, 2003",2003,2537,"['are', 'directors', 'better', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'setting', 'mood', 'menace', 'string', 'clues', 'point', 'truly', 'climactic', 'ending', 'SUSPICION', 'Hitchcock', 'view', 'good', 'guy', 'Cary', 'Crant', 'leering', 'lying', 'cad', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'guilty', 'even', 'worse', 'criminal', 'behavior.Grant', 'Johnnie', 'who', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'fans', 'have', 'always', 'known', 'suave', 'handsome', 'dashing', 'Joan', 'Fontaine', 'Lina', 'rather', 'bookish', 'frump', 'who', 'nevertheless', 'Johnnie', 'eye', 'Early', 'Johnnie', 'interest', 'Lina', 'least', 'partly', 'based', 'family', 'fortune', 'When', 'audience', 'Grant', 'going', 'type', 'playing', 'caddish', 'Johnnie', 'can', 'see', 'smiling', 'eyes', 'suave', 'grin', 'lay', 'twist', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'believed', 'Director', 'Hitchcock', 'slowly', 'up', 'character', 'Johnnie', 'innuendo', 'step', 'way', 'Lina', 'implied', 'charges', 'always', 'find', 'rational', 'answer', 'not', 'point', 'what', 'audience', 'inevitable', 'truth', 'Nigel', 'Bruce', 'Beaky', 'childhood', 'chum', 'Johnnie', 'same', 'innocent', 'charm', 'displayed', 'earlier', 'Dr.', 'Watson', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'series', 'Here', 'Beaky', 'Bruce', 'twin', 'nature', 'Johnnie', 'one', 'must', 'accept', 'negative', 'side', 'one', 'readily', 'positive', 'revelation', 'first', 'Beaky', 'then', 'Johnnie', 'employer', 'Leo', 'G.', 'Carroll', 'mounting', 'evidence', 'accrues', 'convince', 'Lina', 'husband', 'guilty', 'series', 'crimes', 'ranging', 'theft', 'deception', 'murder', 'famous', 'scene', 'Johnnie', 'Lina', 'glass', 'glowing', 'milk', 'indelibly', 'audience', 'collective', 'mind', 'conviction', 'Johnnie', 'indeed', 'creep', 'be.Unfortunately', 'Hitchcock', 'could', 'not', 'allow', 'reputation', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'be', 'tarnished', 'ending', 'movie', 'affirmation', 'guilt', 'had', 'spent', 'better', 'part', 'two', 'hours', 'so', 'carefully', 'constructing', 'turn', 'closing', 'scene', 'viewer', 'gasping', 'disbelief', 'Even', 'viewer', 'glib', 'explanation', 'Johnnie', 'true', 'motivation', 'then', 'acceptance', 'still', 'same', 'cad', 'was', 'start', 'film', 'Still', 'Joan', 'Fontaine', 'Lina', 'managed', 'snare', 'Oscar', 'best', 'actress', 'SUSPICION', 'kind', 'quality', 'film', 'last', 'minute', 'manages', 'engage', 'viewer', 'race', 'time', 'one', 'woman', 'must', 'balance', 'feelings', 'mounting', 'suspicions', 'man', 'charm', 'source', 'love', 'deepest', 'fears']",Suspicion VHS
35058,A2R6RA8FRBS608,0780626702,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[2, 3]","Suspicion was one of Hitchcock's earliest films--and it remains one of his best. The plot moves along at a good pace and the suspense keeps slowly mounting until the final minute or two of them film. People may say that the film, therefore, has an abrupt ending; but I thought it all worked rather well. Only a genius like Alfred Hitchcock could pull this all off!The action begins when spinster Lina McLaidlaw (Joan Fontaine) meets Johnnie Aysgarth (Cary Grant) on a train. Nothing much comes of the meeting--but they do meet again soon afterward on a social occasion. Gradually Lina falls for Johnnie, especially when she overhears her parents resigning themselves to the fact that their daughter will simply never marry.It's not long after the marriage that problems arise. Lina becomes more and more uncomfortable being married to Johnnie when she learns more and more about him, usually through a friend or acquaintance. First there are secretive gambling debts and an extravagant house Johnnie hopes to pay for by gambling. Then Lina learns about the theft of money from Johnnie's boss for which Johnnie gets fired. Lina soon suspects that Johnnie may have killed his best friend just to get his hands on even more money. Finally, Lina becomes so worried and rattled with fear and dread that she assumes Johnnie will kill her for her money, too.The convincing acting stuns me--these actors really know how to act! The choreography is well done in crowd scenes like the hunting expedition and the cinematography shines in the darker scenes in Lina and Johnnie's home near the end of the film.Overall, I highly recommend Suspicion for Cary Grant fans, Hitchcock fans and people who enjoy watching Joan Fontaine on the screen. Look for another fine performance by Auriol Lee who plays Isobel Sedbusk, a writer of murder mysteries that Johnnie loves to read.

35059,A1TT5T47AVDDBM,0780626702,Mcgivern Owen L,"[3, 4]","""Suspicion"" is one more classic Alfred Hitchcock film. Like many, it too is filmed in murky but beautiful black and white.  The key character is Cary Grant, who worked with the great director so often.  Grant plays the role of a lying, scheming, swindling, cheating and thoroughly unlikable fellow. He marries a young but wealthy ingenue, Joan Fontaine. He is patently and without remorse after her inheritance. Fontaine quickly realizes the type of jerk she has married. She even starts to suspect that Grant is out to kill her! The plot further thickens when Grant's buddy, actor Nigel Bruce, dies suddenly on a business trip with Grant. We wait for one of those English detectives that Hitchcock casts so well to haul Grant off to jail. And then? Then there is that famous car ride that ends the movie so abruptly and has given other reviewers fits. It is all too true that ""Suspicion"" ends quickly with no clear-cut resolution. We are left with no clue if the couple divorced, lived happily ever after or if Grant finally got tossed in a British cooler. The abrupt and unresolved ending is similar to ""Notorious"". This reviewer has no problems with murky endings. Why not appreciate them ""as is""? Some interesting sidebars: 1)""Suspicion"" was filmed with an entirely British cast on a Hollywood lot, nowhere close to the English seashore.2) Grant was said to be furious at the Director because Hitchcock allegedly was very patient with Fontaine but hassled him during production.  3) Ms Fontaine won a 1941Best Actress Oscar for her role, making her the ONLY actor/actress to be so recognized for a Hithcock film. The recommendation from this reviewer is to enjoy ""Suspicion"" for what it is-an above average suspense film with perhaps a hole or two in it. Viewers should ignore the fact that Grant and Hitchcock have done better work elsewhere. They might also ignore the fact that RKO Pictures changed the ""original"" ending. That scarcely makes Hollywood history. Why not just calm down and watch the movie? ""Suspicion"" should stand alone on its' own merits.",4,Stop Complaining!

D'angelo ""Mike D' Angelo""","[1, 1]","First of all, the print quality of these four films is flawless.As with all Hitchcock films, knowing the ending in no way diminishes the pleasure of watching them.  &#34;Suspicion&#34; (the one I have already seen many times) remains as fresh and interesting.  The commentary added some extra things to ponder while watching it (such as the very different ending in the original story and the question whether Cary Grant could ever play a murderer).  &#34;The Wrong Man,&#34; based on a true incident, is intriguing in watching the wife slowly unravel under the stress of how an innocent man could easily be caught up and seem guilty.  &#34;Strangers on a Train&#34; is especially interesting when you start comparing the characters and their motivations and actions.  You have quite a mix: the unbalanced, manipulative killer, the wife who finds it convenient not to let the husband go but does nothing to be faithful or even considerate, the tennis pro caught up in the whole thing without realizing it, and the woman he loves.  &#34;I Confess,&#34; with Montgomery Cliff, is a film I had only seen once before.  The commentary added several layers (as to the originally intended back story versus what the studios or censors or audiences of the period would accept) and the whole issue of using someone's integrity and word to work against him and shield the guilty.  These may not be the best known of Hitchcock's films, but they are very good ones.For you they may be wonderful discoveries or may be old friends you get to revisit.

We're never quite sure as Hitchcock loads up the film with more than one McGuffin (glass of milk, Lina's eyeglasses) and tries to keep the audience guessing.

He is going fox hunting and sees her again.  He uses his charms to meet her again.  Lina is completely taken by him even though her parents dislike his reputation.  He finally calls her and they meet at the Fox Hunt Ball.It's a whirlwind romance and marriage.  Johnnie wants to prove that he has reformed and takes a job.  One day Johnnie's old friend Binky (Nigel ""Dr. Watson"" Bruce) and mentions that he saw Johnnie at the race track.  Lina starts to get suspicious of Johnnie.  Things are missing around the house.One day Lina is out shopping and runs into her old friend Isobelle Lenke, an author of murder mysteries.  She also runs into a couple of missing chairs at the pawn shop.  Johnnie arrives home; he backed the winner at the races.  He has won 2,000.  He admits that he used the chairs for the stake.Isobelle comes for dinner and Johnnie starts asking her about her books and ways of killing people.  This of course makes Lina even more suspicious.Things get worse when Binky has an accident and dies.  She starts to fear that she is next.This was a breakout movie for Grant.  Johnnie is a complex role. He is both good and bad. This role helped him break out of his romantic lead role for more interesting roles.For Fontaine, this was not a great stretch.

Beneath her bookish exterior Lina's a repressed soul. But her traditional reservations are merely a faade for lusty home fires that seem to be sparked to satisfaction in her encounter with handsome playboy, Jonnie Aysgarth (Cary Grant). The two soon marry. However, as the romance progresses Jonnie seems to be more than just an elegant rogue. Could it be? Is he a murderer?  Brimming with Hitch's corrosive ambiguities that slowly begin to erode Lina's trust in her new husband, ""Suspicion"" plays tricks on both Lina and the audience's collective understanding of where Jonnie intends to take us with his brooding thoughts and sinister glass of glow-in-the-dark milk.  This is a deeply unsettling, wickedly concocted puzzle; a film that plays more for enigma than plot and tease rather than substance, but it works on every level to tantalize like a car wreck that one is not involved in yet is strangely compelled to.Warner's DVD transfer exhibits a balanced gray scale with deep, solid blacks and reasonably clean whites. Dirt, scratches and other age related artifacts are present but do not terribly distract.

The previous year she had portrayed a very similar character in Hitchcock's ""Rebecca - Criterion Collection.""  Lina McLaidlaw is a slightly more confident and sophisticated version of The Second Mrs. de Winter.  Both characters are nave young Englishwomen, swept off their feet by handsome worldly men.  They discover too late that the men they married may be capable of anything - even murder.After the briefest possible acquaintance, Lina defies her family's wishes and elopes with Johnnie Aysgarth.  Her father has warned her that Johnnie is wild.  Society whispers about his crimes, possibly cheating at cards or being named correspondent in a divorce.  He is a man who has disgraced his name and his family, and now lives on the fringes of polite society surviving only only on his looks and his charm.  General McLaidlaw does not approve of Johnnie, but Lina doesn't care.Almost immediately after they return from the honeymoon, Lina begins to learn that her new husband is not the man she imagined.  The first revelation is that he is completely broke, living on borrowed funds, and expects to be supported by Lina's allowance from her family - and one day to live in style on her inheritance.As the film progresses, the suspense is masterfully built up as Lina learns that Johnnie is also a liar, a thief, a gambler, and an embezzler.  His addiction to the horses has left him perpetually broke and desperate for funds.  She begins to suspect that, in order to get money, Johnnie will stop at nothing, not even the murder of his best friend... or the murder of his wife.If there is a flaw in this film, it's casting Cary Grant as the notorious Johnnie Aysgarth.  Hitchcock once said that one didn't direct Cary Grant, one simply put him in front of a camera.  He certainly has the looks and charm; but is he believable as a villain?  For the movie to really work, you have to believe that Cary Grant is capable of a host of heinous sins.  Hitchcock really strains suspension of disbelief here.As Johnnie's best friend, Beaky, Nigel Bruce give us his trademark good natured, bumbling Englishman character  -  very similar to his version of Dr. Watson inThe Complete Sherlock Holmes Collection.Hitchcock is a master with black and white cinematography.  In one of the film's most famous scenes, Johnnie slowly climbs a curving staircase, carrying a tray with a single glass of milk to his ailing wife.  The house is dark, Johnnie is seen only as a shadowy silhouette, but the glass of milk actually glows on the screen.  Hitchcock wanted us to focus on that glass.  Could it contain...poison?The film also boasts a beautiful score by Franz Waxman built around Lina and Johnnie's love theme,  the Strauss waltz, ""Vienna Blood.""The DVD has an English only soundtrack with available subtitles in English, French or Spanish.  It also includes an original theatrical trailer, and a documentary about the making of the film and the transition between the source material (Before the Fact (Pan Classic Crime)) and the changes made by Hitchcock and the studio.This is one of Hitchcock's best early efforts, but it would have been an even better film had the studio not interfered with his original vision.

35075,A23VBURIWZPRR2,0780626702,purplehaloz,"[1, 1]","Joan Fontaine and Carey Grant play two characters that need each other for different reasons. Grant's character, Johnnie Aysgarth, is looking for financial security through his liason with wealthy women. He plays upon Fontaine's character, Lina's feminine insecurities--she is not beautiful and is growing into spinsterhood--to ring her into his orbit. While secure women would find Johnnie's quirks troublesome--he calls her ""monkey face"" and brags about his scores of romantic conquests on their first date--she falls for his charms and marries him against the wishes of her upper-class parents who disapprove of Johnnie's horse-betting and other unsettling lifestyle habits.Suspicion is a strange story about star-crossed lovers that nevertheless seem to suit each other on some level. The ending is ambiguous, and in a sense, more fulfilling because of it.Suspicion is a wonderful film, one of Hitchcock's most interesting, because the characters so at odds with each other, with one taking advantage of the other, destroying that person's trust, yet seem to keep going in spite of it. One wonders at Lina's refusal to leave Johnnie at every, deceitful turn, yet also begin to see that there might be something besides money that Johnnie is hoping to get out that marriage.

35078,A52VXE9T2T4J1,0780626702,Robert Taylor Brewer,"[2, 2]","The Wrong ManThe Wrong Man was Hitchcock's last ""quiet"" film before a series of blockbuster hits that propelled him to the forefront of public attention with movies like Vertigo, North by Northwest, Psycho and The Birds redefining the term ""suspense film"".  In the compliant 1950's, The Wrong Man caused nary a ripple at the box office with its proposition that police could force an accused to re-enact a crime, a case any C grade lawyer today would get tossed probably before jury selection.  Based on a true story, the solemnity of Henry Fonda's performance intensifies our emotional response to the outrage perpetrated on him and we are made to understand that in mistaken identity, the family suffers most.  The documentary style used by Hitchcock for this film was so realistic other prison inmates, as the film commentary makes clear, were heard to say, ""Hey Henry, what'd they get you for?"".  Reflective commentary and analysis by Peter Bogdanovich (The Last Picture Show).SuspicionCary Grant distances himself from madcap comedy (His Girl Friday, The Awful Truth) and in the space of one motion picture, descends the ladder from likeable buffoon to well intentioned neer-do-well to murder suspect.  This film shows Grant could do serious drama, little wonder Hitchcock followed this effort up with the Cary Grant/Ingrid Bergman thriller Notorious in 1946.  The standard Hitchcock brilliance with light and shadow is on display in the famous ""milk walk"" scene with its required tolerance for ambiguity.  Joan Fontaine won the 1941 Best Actress Academy Award for her portrayal of heiress Lina Aysgarth who suspects her husband Johnnie (Grant) married her for her expected share of dad's estate. Hitchcock filmed multiple endings for this movie, going with the one least likely to damage Cary Grant's career.I ConfessHitchcock tests the limits of faith in this film about a murder confession delivered during the sacrament of confession.  The keys  to the film are the eyes of star Montgomery Clift;  he achieves a full range of emotion with them.  Karl Malden is relentless as Inspector Larrue, determined to follow leads even if they involve a member of the clergy, and Anne Baxter stars as Ruth Grandfort who had an affair with Clift's character, Father Michael Logan prior to his entry into the priesthood.  Filmed in Quebec, Canada, a location with a rich intermingling of  life and faith.Strangers On A TrainThis film opens with a bizarre premise: I'll kill your relative if you kill mine.  Police must investigate when one of the killings takes place - another wrong man gets the blame - this is the only Hitchcock film I know where clues to innocence are blatantly discarded  and the master seems genuinely unperturbed about it.  As a result, some lulls occur during development, but the film gets stronger as it progresses, culminating in an Orson Wells style nightmare at an amusement park reminiscent of the Welles classic, The  Third Man.  In the park, the film recaptures and maintains our interest while shocking viewers with its ending.",5,The Master's Minor Masterpieces,1306800000,"05 31, 2011",2011,3057,"['Wrong', 'ManThe', 'Wrong', 'Man', 'was', 'Hitchcock', 'last', 'quiet', 'film', 'series', 'blockbuster', 'hits', 'propelled', 'forefront', 'public', 'attention', 'movies', 'Vertigo', 'North', 'Northwest', 'Psycho', 'Birds', 'redefining', 'term', 'suspense', 'film', 'compliant', '1950', 'Wrong', 'Man', 'caused', 'nary', 'ripple', 'box', 'office', 'proposition', 'police', 'could', 'force', 'accused', 're-enact', 'crime', 'case', 'C', 'grade', 'lawyer', 'today', 'would', 'get', 'tossed', 'probably', 'jury', 'selection', 'Based', 'true', 'story', 'solemnity', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'performance', 'emotional', 'response', 'outrage', 'perpetrated', 'are', 'made', 'understand', 'mistaken', 'identity', 'family', 'most', 'documentary', 'style', 'used', 'Hitchcock', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'realistic', 'other', 'prison', 'inmates', 'film', 'commentary', 'clear', 'were', 'heard', 'say', 'Hey', 'Henry', 'what', ""'d"", 'get', 'Reflective', 'commentary', 'analysis', 'Peter', 'Bogdanovich', 'Last', 'Picture', 'Show', '.SuspicionCary', 'Grant', 'distances', 'madcap', 'comedy', 'Girl', 'Friday', 'Awful', 'Truth', 'space', 'one', 'motion', 'picture', 'ladder', 'likeable', 'buffoon', 'well', 'intentioned', 'neer-do-well', 'murder', 'suspect', 'film', 'Grant', 'could', 'do', 'serious', 'drama', 'little', 'wonder', 'Hitchcock', 'followed', 'effort', 'up', 'Cary', 'Grant/Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'Notorious', '1946', 'standard', 'Hitchcock', 'brilliance', 'light', 'shadow', 'display', 'famous', 'milk', 'walk', 'scene', 'required', 'tolerance', 'ambiguity', 'Joan', 'Fontaine', 'won', '1941', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Academy', 'Award', 'portrayal', 'heiress', 'Lina', 'Aysgarth', 'who', 'husband', 'Johnnie', 'Grant', 'married', 'expected', 'share', 'dad', 'estate', 'Hitchcock', 'filmed', 'multiple', 'endings', 'movie', 'going', 'one', 'least', 'likely', 'damage', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'career.I', 'ConfessHitchcock', 'limits', 'faith', 'film', 'murder', 'confession', 'delivered', 'sacrament', 'confession', 'keys', 'film', 'are', 'eyes', 'star', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'full', 'range', 'emotion', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'relentless', 'Inspector', 'Larrue', 'determined', 'follow', 'leads', 'even', 'involve', 'member', 'clergy', 'Anne', 'Baxter', 'Ruth', 'Grandfort', 'who', 'had', 'affair', 'Clift', 'character', 'Father', 'Michael', 'Logan', 'prior', 'entry', 'priesthood', 'Filmed', 'Quebec', 'Canada', 'location', 'rich', 'intermingling', 'life', 'faith.Strangers', 'TrainThis', 'film', 'bizarre', 'premise', ""'ll"", 'kill', 'relative', 'kill', 'mine', 'Police', 'must', 'investigate', 'when', 'one', 'killings', 'place', 'wrong', 'man', 'blame', 'only', 'Hitchcock', 'film', 'know', 'where', 'clues', 'innocence', 'are', 'blatantly', 'discarded', 'master', 'genuinely', 'unperturbed', 'result', 'lulls', 'occur', 'development', 'film', 'stronger', 'culminating', 'Orson', 'Wells', 'style', 'nightmare', 'amusement', 'park', 'reminiscent', 'Welles', 'classic', 'Third', 'Man', 'park', 'film', 'recaptures', 'interest', 'shocking', 'viewers', 'ending']",Suspicion VHS

I'm a Hitch fan for so long I can't remember enjoying his movies, his presentation, his presence in the cameos!  Did he start that or where there directors before him doing this?  I like it anyway.I CONFESS - I like the way that Hitch presents it kinda like the end at the beginning.  We already know who don it before the characters know.  That walk that the priest takes where he is making the actual decision to not tell what he knows becuase of his position as a priest that was really done well.  Kinda like him starting at 'I'm so scared' and then progessing without one word to the point where he has made up his mind what he will do and ends his reflections at the police station because of course he can't help but know that they are looking for him.  The end scence - really a great one with all the answers out in the open.  Well well done.  That poor lady with the most horrendous husband.  Letting the one person who he should have protected with the truth (no matter the consequences) take the blame for something that he had done.  Here's a stopper - the jury actually finds not that the is not guilty but that the evidence doesn't support a guilty verdict.  Shades of present day jurispurdence!SUSPICION - this has Mr. Grant and one of my favorite actresses Joan Fontaine.  She plays this demer part to perfection.  Up against the ever debonair Cary Grant.  They both do an excellent job in their roles.  The movie does slow down a little at times but it does not take too much away from the movement.  The first time I saw this many years ago I could not tell if Johnny was guilty of trying to murder his wife.  So of course that says a lot for Hitch's presentation style.  So from I CONFESS where we know all at the start and now with SUSPICION where we must wait further into the movie to know what is true, we see the wide range of presentation that Hitch is famous for.  Good Movie!THE WRONG MAN - Henry Fonda is great!  So much the one to live this life of trying to protect his weakling wife and be the brave man that is honest and forthright with the charges that the police level against him.  I was a little disappointed that the wife had to be taken away but they tell you from the start that this is a true story (or made after one - I can't remeber).  I always like the way they give updates to where the characters are in real life when it''s a movie taken from real life happening.  One thing I think Hitch should have handled better - the person who was suppose to be so much looking like Fonda's character really didn't look that much like him.  Only similarity to me was they were both tall.  They should have been able to find someone who more closely resembled Fonda - IMHO.Another thing worth mentioning is how when the real robber gets caught, the store people catch him and 'hold' him until the police get there.  That guy just wimpers and says he has a wife and kids and please don't hurt him.  Amazing!  If that was happening today - and it is more and more - that guy would have been dead or the people in the store would have been.  The part doesn't hold up over time and I'm pretty sure I laughed when I saw it the first time many years ago.

After they elope, she begins to fear for her life when she discovers Johnny's dark past and real intentions in this Hitchcock thriller.Scene:  Is going to run away with John to elope; touching scene when she walks in to her parents room -- dad smoking his pipe; mother crocheting -- and though they do not suspect a thing, she is torn with guilt.  Joan Fontaine's acting in this scene is quite heart-wrenching!Some humor:  it seems dear Johnny lives off other peoples' money and when asked by his new wife how is he going to pay for this new house, the maid, etc., he says, ""Borrow more!""  When she says get a job, he does a double-take!  Oh brother!Or when he gets two antique chairs from his new father-in-law, his first thought is to sell them, as he shrugs to the audience.Suspicion spends a lot of time on the romance and the ""look what I got myself into"" sort of plot between these newlyweds.But soon, she begins to suspect a dark side to Johnny, a side that may mean her murder at his hands!He said he had a job, but his best pal Beaky says that he was at the races!  Oh, what happened to the antique chairs?  He sold them to pay his gambling and betting debts!  Oh boy!  ""Well, of course it's Johnny!""She finds her antiques in an antique shop -- soon after, he gets her a mink, jewels and Beekie a cane!  He won a bit of money in the races.  Lina is shocked!  ""See, that's Johnny!""  Where did he get the money?  She forgives him when he buys the chairs back.The first half of the film runs like a romantic comedy for sure, complete with flutes and silly music in the background.But the music gets darker as Lina is finding out more and more that her husband lives off other people's wealth and she's not happy about it.  She finds that he was at the races again, even though he promised he wouldn't and also that he was caught embezzling from his employer who laid him off six weeks before and never told her.  The employer/cousin is played by Leo G. Carroll, who appeared in several Hitchcock films over the years.Lina has had enough, packs her bags and writes a letter telling him that she is leaving him.  Another emotional scene, as she writes these words and realizes what they mean to her as well as to their relationship.  Touching stuff.  But then she rips up the letter.  Johnny then walks into the room and they have a confrontation.  However, he reveals that her father has passed away and hands her the telegram.Now, all through the film there have been the comments here and there ""Do you think I'm trying to kill you?"" and other such murderous thoughts that she does not ""tweak"" on until later in the film.The famous milk scene when an apparently glowing glass of milk is taken up the stairs and presented to his wife.  And earlier, Johnny was asking someone about an odorless, tasteless poison.The end of the film is gripping and suspenseful.  The beginning though plays like an average tired romantic film.  It's not sure if it wants to be a ""chick flick"" or a romantic ""murder mystery.""I'm happy to report that Hitchcock polished his skills as a director in the 1950s, but Suspicion, though well done, does not yet meet the bar set by later films.As a final note, I like the 1940s chaste kissing in romantic films better than the ""eating face"" slobbering of some of today's romantic films and television.  There was more an air of mystery and excitement in these films that one is hard-pressed to discover today in most films.  Some romantic films do have that charm, such as the recent ""The Proposal.""

Cary Grant was well-suited for his role as Johnny, but I felt the melodramatics toward the end were rather banal and obvious; surely there could have been a more satisfying ending - could there not? Hitchcock is seen in his token cameo halfway thru the film - mailing a letter in a village mailbox.........Hitchcock's suspense thriller is about a woman who gradually realises she may be married to a killer (and may be next on his list). An excellent production unravels at the end due to RKO's insistence that Grant retain his ""attractive"" image. This forced the writers to opt for the usual dull (and rather infuriating) moral ending. Nigel Bruce received kudos for his playing of Johnny's friend ""Beaky"" and there are more than a few similarities in Fontaine's character which seem borrowed from REBECCA. Intriguing and finely played, the movie's end is an unfortunate let-down to some while others feel that it's fitting. As a trivia footnote to those who are interested -it's fairly common knowledge among movie buffs that Hitchcock actually planted an incandescent light inside that ""fatal"" glass of milk which Grant so dramatically carries upstairs.....It could be said that the AA Fontaine won for this film cemented the practically life-long feud between she and her sister Olivia de Havilland; Olivia supposedly was jealous of his little sister winning an Oscar before she did - to say nothing of getting married first!",4,AN OSCAR FOR FONTAINE.,947980800,"01 16, 2000",2000,1591,"['beautiful', 'performance', 'Fontaine', 'daughter', 'wealthy', 'English', 'family', 'who', 'charmed', ""ne're-do-well"", 'wastrel', 'captivating', 'playing', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'was', 'well-suited', 'role', 'Johnny', 'felt', 'melodramatics', 'end', 'were', 'rather', 'banal', 'obvious', 'surely', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'satisfying', 'ending', 'could', 'there', 'not', 'Hitchcock', 'seen', 'token', 'cameo', 'halfway', 'film', 'mailing', 'letter', 'village', 'mailbox', 'Hitchcock', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'woman', 'who', 'gradually', 'may', 'be', 'married', 'killer', 'may', 'be', 'next', 'list', 'excellent', 'production', 'unravels', 'end', 'due', 'RKO', 'insistence', 'Grant', 'retain', 'attractive', 'image', 'forced', 'writers', 'opt', 'usual', 'dull', 'rather', 'infuriating', 'moral', 'ending', 'Nigel', 'Bruce', 'received', 'kudos', 'playing', 'Johnny', 'friend', 'Beaky', 'are', 'more', 'few', 'similarities', 'Fontaine', 'character', 'seem', 'borrowed', 'REBECCA', 'Intriguing', 'finely', 'played', 'movie', 'end', 'unfortunate', 'let-down', 'others', 'feel', 'fitting', 'trivia', 'footnote', 'who', 'are', 'interested', '-it', 'fairly', 'common', 'knowledge', 'movie', 'buffs', 'Hitchcock', 'actually', 'planted', 'incandescent', 'light', 'fatal', 'glass', 'milk', 'Grant', 'dramatically', 'upstairs', '..It', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'AA', 'Fontaine', 'won', 'film', 'cemented', 'practically', 'life-long', 'feud', 'sister', 'Olivia', 'de', 'Havilland', 'Olivia', 'supposedly', 'was', 'jealous', 'little', 'sister', 'winning', 'Oscar', 'did', 'say', 'nothing', 'getting', 'married', 'first']",Suspicion VHS

Rivers,"[7, 10]","Cut from the same stylistic cloth as ""Rebecca,"" director Alfred Hitchcock's first teaming with Cary Grant was this disappointing 1941 adaptation of Francis Iles' novel ""Before the Fact."" Hitchcock successfully cast Grant against type as Johnnie - a reckless, irresponsible playboy who marries the shy Lina (played by an ineffectual Joan Fontaine). Because of mounting circumstantial evidence, Lina suspects that her husband is a murderer. Lina's psychological tug of war builds to a ludicrous climax that negates the entire film. If Hitchcock had his way, ""Suspicion"" would have evolved into a disturbing thriller rather than a missed opportunity. Unfortunately, RKO altered the framework of ""Suspicion"" with the same callous insensitivity that marred Orson Welles' ""The Magnificent Ambersons."" Another drawback is the lack of chemistry between Grant and Fontaine. In future films, Hitchcock made certain Grant was paired with romantically compatible co-stars such as Ingrid Bergman and Grace Kelly.

Screen play (co-authored by playwright Maxwell Anderson), acting ( Henry Fonda is The Man and Vera Miles is his wife), photography (especially inside the old Stork Club and around New York City), sound, and the film's score are all A-list quality!  Includes several typical Hitchcock film tricks with the most remarkable being when the camera seems to pass through a narrow peep-hole slit in a jail cell door.Although finally cleared, Fonda's character's life is destroyed with his wife relegated to an insane asylum.  As apparently happened in real lifeHitchcock gets in his trademark cameo appearance by introducing the film.  It's a serious one.  Bernard Herrmann's score is unnervingly excellent (as usual!).  A major contribution to the ""look and feel"" of the film.A poignant statement from the 1950's  that remains (unfortunately) poignant today.WILLIAM FLANIGAN, Ph.D.",3,THE WRONG MAN: An unpleasant but riveting experience,1264896000,"01 31, 2010",2010,1045,"['sad', 'film', 'based', 'sad', 'true', 'story', 'entry', 'Hitchcock', 'dark', 'sinister', 'gloomy', 'forbidding', 'period', 'favorite', 'theme', 'used', 'film', 'title', 'Screen', 'play', 'co-authored', 'playwright', 'Maxwell', 'Anderson', 'acting', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'Man', 'Vera', 'Miles', 'wife', 'photography', 'especially', 'old', 'Stork', 'Club', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'sound', 'film', 'score', 'are', 'A-list', 'quality', 'several', 'typical', 'Hitchcock', 'film', 'tricks', 'most', 'remarkable', 'being', 'when', 'camera', 'pass', 'narrow', 'peep-hole', 'slit', 'jail', 'cell', 'finally', 'cleared', 'Fonda', 'character', 'life', 'destroyed', 'wife', 'relegated', 'insane', 'asylum', 'apparently', 'happened', 'real', 'lifeHitchcock', 'trademark', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'introducing', 'film', 'serious', 'one', 'Bernard', 'Herrmann', 'score', 'unnervingly', 'excellent', 'usual', 'major', 'contribution', 'look', 'feel', 'film.A', 'poignant', 'statement', '1950', 'unfortunately', 'poignant', 'today.WILLIAM', 'FLANIGAN', 'Ph.D']",Suspicion VHS

35108,AP3B615GM191G,0780626702,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[2, 3]","On the surface, ""Suspicion"" looks like a film that would be a perfect fit for Hitchcock's directorial touch.  It contains two star leads, great opportunities for tremendous acting, and even more possibilities for intense drama/suspense.  Unfortunately, Hitch fails to cull all those aspects together in this case, instead producing a middling film with a conclusion that will have you wondering if it was all worth it.For a basic plot summary, ""Suspicion"" sees debonair gentleman Johnnie (Cary Grant) marry the rather practical Lina (Joan Fontaine).  After the fabulous courtship, however, Lina discovers that Johnnie is nowhere near what he seemed at first, and that he may even have some murderous intentions in order to get himself out of debt.The trouble with ""Suspicion"" is twofold:First, none of the character development ends up leading anywhere.  I won't give any major spoilers here, but suffice it to say that in the end, you will be severely disappointed with how the characters turn out.  In typical ""40's cinema"" fashion, emotions turn on a dime with no rhyme or reason and are explained away with a single sentence at the end.Secondly, the ""suspense"" promised us only comes near the very end of the film, and then is quickly ruined by (again) the cop-out ending.  The rest of the run-time is filled with scenes that should be building up the two lead characters, but instead amount to waffling back and forth between ""Lina loves Johnnie"" and ""Lina suspects Johnnie"".Put simply, ""Suspicion"" may have thrilled film fans during its time, but it certainly does not hold up well today.  I'll give it 2.5 stars because the acting is quite fine throughout, but other than that there just isn't much to get excited about here.",2,Middling Plot Abjectly Ruined By Cop-Out Ending,1340841600,"06 28, 2012",2012,1732,"['surface', 'Suspicion', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'perfect', 'fit', 'Hitchcock', 'directorial', 'touch', 'two', 'star', 'leads', 'great', 'opportunities', 'tremendous', 'acting', 'even', 'more', 'possibilities', 'intense', 'drama/suspense', 'Unfortunately', 'Hitch', 'cull', 'aspects', 'together', 'case', 'instead', 'producing', 'middling', 'film', 'conclusion', 'will', 'have', 'wondering', 'was', 'worth', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Suspicion', 'sees', 'debonair', 'gentleman', 'Johnnie', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'marry', 'rather', 'practical', 'Lina', 'Joan', 'Fontaine', 'fabulous', 'courtship', 'however', 'Lina', 'Johnnie', 'nowhere', 'what', 'seemed', 'first', 'may', 'even', 'have', 'murderous', 'intentions', 'order', 'get', 'debt.The', 'trouble', 'Suspicion', 'twofold', 'First', 'none', 'character', 'development', 'up', 'leading', 'anywhere', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'major', 'spoilers', 'here', 'say', 'end', 'will', 'be', 'severely', 'disappointed', 'how', 'characters', 'turn', 'out', 'typical', '40', 'cinema', 'fashion', 'emotions', 'turn', 'dime', 'rhyme', 'reason', 'are', 'explained', 'away', 'single', 'sentence', 'end.Secondly', 'suspense', 'promised', 'only', 'very', 'end', 'film', 'then', 'quickly', 'ruined', 'again', 'cop-out', 'ending', 'rest', 'run-time', 'filled', 'scenes', 'should', 'be', 'building', 'up', 'two', 'lead', 'characters', 'instead', 'amount', 'waffling', 'back', 'forth', 'Lina', 'Johnnie', 'Lina', 'Johnnie', '.Put', 'simply', 'Suspicion', 'may', 'have', 'thrilled', 'film', 'fans', 'time', 'certainly', 'not', 'hold', 'up', 'well', 'today', ""'ll"", 'give', '2.5', 'stars', 'acting', 'quite', 'fine', 'other', 'just', ""n't"", 'much', 'get', 'excited', 'here']",Suspicion VHS
