511004,A1DB4U8ISVULVE,B00001O2GY,Bill Smith,"[0, 0]","(this reviews the original 2000 DVD release)This is a common theme for baseball in the Bud Selig era. They could have done it so right, and instead they commit nonsensical errors. This DVD could have been stunning and perfect. Instead, it is ultimately a disappointment. How? I will tell you how.The main program giving short historical biographies of the all century players is the best part, and for the most part is done properly and the fact that Bob Costas narrates it is a big reason why. That part still could have been longer and more thorough detailing the accomplishments of the players.Baseball fans in general are surprisingly clueless about what many of these players accomplished, especially those that did not play in the New York, Boston and LA markets. For example, believe it or not, Selig actually had to step in and place Stan Musial on the All Century Team because the fans ignorantly failed to vote him in. He's only one of the top 5 hitters in baseball history. Aaron, Mays and Musial are still the only players with over 6000 total bases (Musial still #2). Career WAR better than Mantle, Williams and Gehrig (#7 all time). .331 lifetime hitter, 24 all star games, 3 time MVP, 3 time World Series Champion, over 3600 hits (still #4 all time), the all time NL hit leader until Pete Rose broke his record, led the league in batting 7 times, missed 500 HR only because of his year in WWII. #3 all time in doubles, #7 all time in RBI, #3 all time in Runs Created. On top of that, he was a genuine hero and the ideal role model. Yet the fans didn't even put Musial on the All Century Team.What is the most disappointing about this DVD is the short shrift it gives to the All Century introductions at the 99 All Star Game at Fenway and the subsequent intro at the 99 World Series at Turner Field. Instead of showing the entire on field intros as they occurred, MLB condenses these priceless tributes to short inadequate highlight reels. The Fenway ceremony is condensed to about 5 minutes (it took about 20) and the Turner ceremony is shorted to about 3 minutes. The DVD thus does not even show everybody on the All Century Team that were there get introduced (for instance, at Fenway, Brock is not shown, as well as others). And the Fenway one does not show the entire tribute to Ted Williams either--again that is condensed. Same thing for the one at Turner, where there were even more players present. Why not show the entire on field ceremonies at each game? How difficult would that have been? Its absurd that MLB missed this priceless chance to document once in a lifetime appearances of the greatest living players together all to what---save a few dollars on DVD space? The idiocy in compiling this part of the DVD is monumental and ridiculous. Thank God I hung onto my complete tape of the Fenway pre game ceremonies, including all the intros and the Williams tribute and throwing the first pitch.In retrospect, its also quite embarrassing that players like McGwire and Clemens are sharing the stage with legends like Musial, Mays, Williams and Aaron who did it the right way. Even with steroids, its ludicrous that McGwire would ever be considered one of baseball's 30 greatest players ever. MLB needs to redo this DVD and add the unedited uncut complete intros to the All Century Team done at both Fenway and Turner Field, and do something right for a change. Its still a valuable DVD for a baseball enthusiast and the general fan, but its irritating that it could have been so much better.by the way, notice Barry Bonds is not on the All Century Team. There is your answer as to why Bonds' stats suddenly became gargantuan starting around year 2000. This team was picked in 1998-1999, right around the McGwire-Sosa HR race of 98. Bonds, despite having a good career to that point, was not the focal point of baseball. Then, as McGwire and Griffey get selected to this All Century team, Bonds is not and the spotlight is not on him. You can bet that this did not sit well with Bonds, and suddenly his stats go from very good to Ruthian. Bonds was feeling left out, and turned to steroids to make sure the spotlight went his way. The line of demarcation couldn't be more clear.",3,Baseball drops the ball when it could have hit a home run,1390867200,"01 28, 2014",2014,4204,"['original', '2000', 'DVD', 'release', 'common', 'theme', 'baseball', 'Bud', 'Selig', 'era', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'right', 'instead', 'commit', 'nonsensical', 'errors', 'DVD', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'stunning', 'perfect', 'Instead', 'ultimately', 'disappointment', 'How', 'will', 'tell', 'how.The', 'main', 'program', 'giving', 'short', 'historical', 'biographies', 'century', 'players', 'best', 'part', 'most', 'part', 'done', 'properly', 'fact', 'Bob', 'Costas', 'big', 'reason', 'why', 'part', 'still', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'longer', 'more', 'thorough', 'detailing', 'accomplishments', 'players.Baseball', 'fans', 'general', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'clueless', 'what', 'many', 'players', 'accomplished', 'especially', 'did', 'not', 'play', 'New', 'York', 'Boston', 'LA', 'markets', 'example', 'believe', 'not', 'Selig', 'actually', 'had', 'step', 'place', 'Stan', 'Musial', 'All', 'Century', 'Team', 'fans', 'ignorantly', 'failed', 'vote', 'only', 'one', 'top', '5', 'hitters', 'baseball', 'history', 'Aaron', 'Mays', 'Musial', 'are', 'still', 'only', 'players', '6000', 'total', 'bases', 'Musial', 'still', '2', 'Career', 'WAR', 'better', 'Mantle', 'Williams', 'Gehrig', '7', 'time', '.331', 'lifetime', 'hitter', '24', 'star', 'games', '3', 'time', 'MVP', '3', 'time', 'World', 'Series', 'Champion', '3600', 'hits', 'still', '4', 'time', 'time', 'NL', 'hit', 'leader', 'Pete', 'Rose', 'broke', 'record', 'led', 'league', 'batting', '7', 'times', 'missed', '500', 'HR', 'only', 'year', 'WWII', '3', 'time', 'doubles', '7', 'time', 'RBI', '3', 'time', 'Runs', 'Created', 'top', 'was', 'genuine', 'hero', 'ideal', 'role', 'model', 'fans', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'put', 'Musial', 'All', 'Century', 'Team.What', 'most', 'disappointing', 'DVD', 'short', 'shrift', 'All', 'Century', 'introductions', '99', 'All', 'Star', 'Game', 'Fenway', 'subsequent', 'intro', '99', 'World', 'Series', 'Turner', 'Field', 'Instead', 'showing', 'entire', 'field', 'intros', 'occurred', 'MLB', 'priceless', 'tributes', 'short', 'inadequate', 'highlight', 'reels', 'Fenway', 'ceremony', 'condensed', '5', 'minutes', 'took', 'about', '20', 'Turner', 'ceremony', 'shorted', '3', 'minutes', 'DVD', 'thus', 'not', 'even', 'show', 'everybody', 'All', 'Century', 'Team', 'were', 'get', 'introduced', 'instance', 'Fenway', 'Brock', 'not', 'shown', 'as', 'well', 'others', 'Fenway', 'one', 'not', 'show', 'entire', 'tribute', 'Ted', 'Williams', 'either', 'again', 'condensed', 'Same', 'thing', 'one', 'Turner', 'where', 'were', 'even', 'more', 'players', 'present', 'Why', 'not', 'show', 'entire', 'field', 'ceremonies', 'game', 'How', 'difficult', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'absurd', 'MLB', 'missed', 'priceless', 'chance', 'document', 'once', 'lifetime', 'appearances', 'greatest', 'living', 'players', 'together', 'what', '-save', 'few', 'dollars', 'DVD', 'space', 'idiocy', 'compiling', 'part', 'DVD', 'monumental', 'ridiculous', 'Thank', 'God', 'hung', 'complete', 'tape', 'Fenway', 'pre', 'game', 'ceremonies', 'including', 'intros', 'Williams', 'tribute', 'throwing', 'first', 'pitch.In', 'retrospect', 'also', 'quite', 'embarrassing', 'players', 'McGwire', 'Clemens', 'are', 'sharing', 'stage', 'legends', 'Musial', 'Mays', 'Williams', 'Aaron', 'who', 'did', 'right', 'way', 'Even', 'steroids', 'ludicrous', 'McGwire', 'would', 'ever', 'be', 'considered', 'one', 'baseball', '30', 'greatest', 'players', 'ever', 'MLB', 'redo', 'DVD', 'add', 'unedited', 'uncut', 'complete', 'intros', 'All', 'Century', 'Team', 'done', 'Fenway', 'Turner', 'Field', 'do', 'something', 'right', 'change', 'still', 'valuable', 'DVD', 'baseball', 'enthusiast', 'general', 'fan', 'irritating', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'way', 'notice', 'Barry', 'Bonds', 'not', 'All', 'Century', 'Team', 'answer', 'why', 'Bonds', 'stats', 'suddenly', 'became', 'gargantuan', 'starting', 'year', '2000', 'team', 'was', 'picked', '1998-1999', 'right', 'McGwire-Sosa', 'HR', 'race', '98', 'Bonds', 'having', 'good', 'career', 'point', 'was', 'not', 'focal', 'point', 'baseball', 'Then', 'McGwire', 'Griffey', 'get', 'selected', 'All', 'Century', 'team', 'Bonds', 'not', 'spotlight', 'not', 'can', 'bet', 'did', 'not', 'sit', 'well', 'Bonds', 'suddenly', 'stats', 'go', 'very', 'good', 'Ruthian', 'Bonds', 'was', 'feeling', 'left', 'out', 'turned', 'steroids', 'make', 'sure', 'spotlight', 'went', 'way', 'line', 'demarcation', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'clear']",Major League Baseball - All Century Team VHS

The primary statistics about each player are emphasized with brief testimonials from other great players that played with them. It was pleasant to see the clips of the players in action, some of them are obvious entries in the all-time great plays. Who can ever forget Willie Mays' over the shoulder catch?If you are a baseball fan you may disagree with the choices, but you cannot argue that this tape is an excellent tribute to the greatest of the greatest game.One of my favorite points of baseball discussion is the single greatest statistical accomplishment of all time. In my opinion, it is the fact that in two seasons Babe Ruth personally had more home runs than all the other teams in the American League combined.

A truer phrase was never spoken, as there is nothing like the sport of baseball to spark arguments and create comparisons day after day.  Due to the long history of major league baseball, dating back (in its current form) to the earliest years of the 20th century, fans have always compared the stars of the past to the stars of today.This DVD continues to fuel that fire of comparison by putting together a ""Blue Ribbon Panel"" to decide on the greatest baseball players of the 20th century.  Though the choices are relatively straightforward and won't give hard-core baseball fans any new information, it is the debate the list sparks that will have fans discussing it long after you hit the ""Eject"" button.  Maybe Nap Lajoie should have started at second...or Ivan ""Pudge"" Rodriguez behind the plate...and how can Mordecai ""Three Finger"" Brown and Greg Maddux not be on the starting staff?  Those are just a sampling of the questions that this program could possibly produce, and that is the beauty of it...each baseball fan has there own opinion!The only downside of this tribute to baseball history is the continued reminder (with the including of Mark McGwire and Roger Clemens on the starting roster) of the Steroid Era sweeping baseball at the turn of the century.  Could we really have been that short-sighted (with the answer, sadly, being a definitive ""yes"") to bestow honor upon honor on men whose feats seemed (and turned out to be exactly that) too good to be true?  It is actually fitting that players like McGwire and Clemens were featured, however, as a century-long reminder to baseball about the dangers of ignoring a problem before it explodes in your face down the road.Finally, a special feature (the pre-game festivities of the 1999 All-Star Game) on the disc may eclipse the entire rest of the content, as baseball ""lifers"" will have trouble holding back the tears seeing all the legends of the game (with Ted Williams front and center) gathered on the hallowed ground of Fenway Park.Thus, I recommend this DVD to any fan of baseball, young or old, as it will serve to re-kindle the old arguments and keep interest in the game once revered as the ""National Pastime"".",4,A Great Tribute To Baseball History (With A Few Moments That Will Stick In Your Craw),1266105600,"02 14, 2010",2010,2339,"['journalist', 'Bruce', 'Catton', 'once', 'said', 'Say', 'much', 'big', 'league', 'baseball', 'question', 'greatest', 'conversation', 'piece', 'ever', 'invented', 'truer', 'phrase', 'was', 'never', 'spoken', 'nothing', 'sport', 'baseball', 'spark', 'arguments', 'create', 'comparisons', 'day', 'day', 'Due', 'long', 'history', 'major', 'league', 'baseball', 'dating', 'back', 'current', 'form', 'earliest', 'years', '20th', 'century', 'fans', 'have', 'always', 'compared', 'stars', 'past', 'stars', 'today.This', 'DVD', 'fuel', 'fire', 'comparison', 'putting', 'together', 'Blue', 'Ribbon', 'Panel', 'decide', 'greatest', 'baseball', 'players', '20th', 'century', 'choices', 'are', 'relatively', 'straightforward', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'hard-core', 'baseball', 'fans', 'new', 'information', 'debate', 'list', 'will', 'have', 'fans', 'discussing', 'long', 'hit', 'Eject', 'button', 'Maybe', 'Nap', 'Lajoie', 'should', 'have', 'started', 'second', 'Ivan', 'Pudge', 'Rodriguez', 'plate', 'how', 'can', 'Mordecai', 'Three', 'Finger', 'Brown', 'Greg', 'Maddux', 'not', 'be', 'starting', 'staff', 'are', 'just', 'sampling', 'questions', 'program', 'could', 'possibly', 'produce', 'beauty', 'baseball', 'fan', 'there', 'own', 'opinion', 'only', 'downside', 'tribute', 'baseball', 'history', 'continued', 'reminder', 'including', 'Mark', 'McGwire', 'Roger', 'Clemens', 'starting', 'roster', 'Steroid', 'Era', 'sweeping', 'baseball', 'turn', 'century', 'Could', 'really', 'have', 'been', 'short-sighted', 'answer', 'sadly', 'being', 'definitive', 'yes', 'bestow', 'honor', 'honor', 'men', 'feats', 'seemed', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'exactly', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'true', 'actually', 'fitting', 'players', 'McGwire', 'Clemens', 'were', 'featured', 'however', 'century-long', 'reminder', 'baseball', 'dangers', 'ignoring', 'problem', 'face', 'down', 'road.Finally', 'special', 'feature', 'pre-game', 'festivities', '1999', 'All-Star', 'Game', 'disc', 'may', 'eclipse', 'entire', 'rest', 'content', 'baseball', 'lifers', 'will', 'have', 'trouble', 'holding', 'back', 'tears', 'seeing', 'legends', 'game', 'Ted', 'Williams', 'front', 'center', 'gathered', 'hallowed', 'ground', 'Fenway', 'Park.Thus', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'fan', 'baseball', 'young', 'old', 'will', 'serve', 're-kindle', 'old', 'arguments', 'keep', 'interest', 'game', 'once', 'revered', 'National', 'Pastime']",Major League Baseball - All Century Team VHS
