Although I love his seductive photography of Manhattan, San Francisco, or Paris, they will feel as alien to a person that grew up there as, Siberia. That gets to the core of my dislike for this movie. It seems to be completely lacking an ability to imagine real people in a real place, yet it is a clear attempt at social commentary. Unfortunately it comes across as a quick bitter sketch of a general disdain for soul-less social climbers.The women in this movie seem like dogs paddling frantically for something that wants to get married. All the while set in a jumbled mess that would fill in for San Francisco, with seemingly all transplanted New Yorker's, moving around as if in a caravan, bumping into each other at the opportune moment to propel the story forward.Critique obsession with money and status all you want, he wouldn't be the first (shades of Louis Bunuel), but this story comes across as being pretty down on all women in general (again, shades of Bunuel). The men in this movie, even though they are corrupt, abusive and sneaks; they come across as just ""guys being guys"".. it's the women that need them that truly seem pathetic. You won't find any redemption unfortunately, except Cate Blanchette's performance. The women are all on a one way trip to crazytown. I love the score, I even love the way he tries to cut and paste the city I grew up in together, but in the end, it comes across as a bitter slice of baloney.",2,"Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown, American Chapter.",1391212800,"02 1, 2014",2014,1538,"['Woody', 'Allen', 'amazingly', 'talented', 'creating', 'fictional', 'cities', 'shot', 'location', 'real', 'cities', 'love', 'seductive', 'photography', 'Manhattan', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Paris', 'will', 'feel', 'alien', 'person', 'grew', 'up', 'there', 'Siberia', 'core', 'dislike', 'movie', 'be', 'completely', 'lacking', 'ability', 'imagine', 'real', 'people', 'real', 'place', 'clear', 'attempt', 'social', 'commentary', 'quick', 'bitter', 'sketch', 'general', 'disdain', 'soul-less', 'social', 'climbers.The', 'women', 'movie', 'seem', 'dogs', 'paddling', 'frantically', 'something', 'get', 'married', 'while', 'set', 'jumbled', 'mess', 'would', 'fill', 'San', 'Francisco', 'seemingly', 'transplanted', 'New', 'Yorker', 'moving', 'around', 'caravan', 'bumping', 'other', 'opportune', 'moment', 'propel', 'story', 'forward.Critique', 'obsession', 'money', 'status', 'want', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'first', 'shades', 'Louis', 'Bunuel', 'story', 'across', 'being', 'pretty', 'down', 'women', 'general', 'again', 'shades', 'Bunuel', 'men', 'movie', 'even', 'are', 'corrupt', 'abusive', 'sneaks', 'come', 'just', 'guys', 'being', 'guys', '..', 'women', 'need', 'truly', 'seem', 'pathetic', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'redemption', 'unfortunately', 'Cate', 'Blanchette', 'performance', 'women', 'are', 'one', 'way', 'trip', 'crazytown', 'love', 'score', 'even', 'love', 'way', 'cut', 'paste', 'city', 'grew', 'up', 'together', 'end', 'bitter', 'slice', 'baloney']",Blue Jasmine

1657767,AGEIT17HENDIS,B00DL47RQ2,Alfred Johnson,"[1, 4]","Woody Allen has been excellent in cinematically portraying (and poking fun at) various aspects of growing up absurd in Brooklyn, the Bronx and Manhattan, growing up as Jewish kid with a very subtle sense of the outsider coming inside as things changed in the post- World War II American sociological landscape. Changed in the red scare cold war night of the 1950s which charged everyone from Jewish kids in Brooklyn (and those other city locales) to Irish-Catholic kids from Hullsville on the Massachusetts shoreline to turn in vanilla Americans. Check. Woody Allen has been excellent in cinematically portraying the East Coast-West Coast culturati warfare (now decidedly won by the Left Coast). Check. Woody Allen has been excellent in transferring his comedic writing and directing skills to Europe over the past few films. Check. Which leads us to the few under review, Blue Jasmine,  his updated echo of Tennessee Williams' dramatic look (Street Car Named Desire, The Rose Tattoo, with a touch of Suddenly, Last Summer)  at how the mighty (or one mighty) has followed in the post-2008 world of high stakes high finance.  In short a look at class in contemporary America, a small snapshot of the one-sided class war where the good guys are not winning but maybe, just maybe they will survive.We have known ever since F. Scott Fitzgerald that the rich, hell, the very rich and not just the ordinary rich, are different, very different, from you and me and Woody here tries to rub our noses in this difference even when the rich are on the way down, down into the mean streets (here of Frisco town). I am not altogether convinced, at least off of this film presentation, that he succeeded in that effort. What I am convinced of though is that Cate Blanchett (and to a lesser extent Bobby Cannavale and Sally Hawkins as two working -class characters) saved his bacon on this one by both breathing life into the character of Jasmine and by flooding the screen with one of the most nuanced performances in her outstanding career.  Beautifully mannered and at home amount the rich and famous or manic, alcoholic and nothing but a drag on company she forced the viewer to deal with her presence. Woody on his own on this one, at least based on the story line and the over the top dialogue, could not have pulled as much power out of this film without that performance.Here is why. Through the devise of having to two non-biologically connected sisters (Jasmine and Ginger), the one upscale with great expectation Hamptons dreams and the other strictly working class with small, or maybe no dreams, maybe just trying to keep above water, Woody is able give him take a look at class society in contemporary post-crash America. And it ain't pretty, even for the fallen of the one percent. Except Jasmine steadfastly refuses to believe there was any such thing as downward mobility in the world (downward mobility courtesy of a reckless wheeler-dealer husband played by Alex Baldwin who turns out to have been just another guy working the age-old Ponzi scheme and who also committed suicide in prison after she turned him in). And so she lives in her own little universe, keeps her own sense of self up  by berating Ginger and her obvious working class ethos (pizza and television sports, sex, hell, maybe even bowling) and by scheming to get back on top anyway she can. Unsuccessfully as the film ends, and end though where she is as befuddled by her life and its downward drift as when she started. And that may say more about Allen's ability to do more than make stock figures out of his characters than what was possible to explore here.

While he fluctuates tones and has created masterpieces in both comedy and drama (and some a pure fusion of both), his style is never misrepresented and both genres feel very &#8216;Woody Allen&#8217; when all is said and done.  In other words; you know a Woody Allen film when you see one.  This is far from a bad thing, especially since Woody uses enough diversity in his tones, themes and subjects to create unique visions all their own.  Sure, he&#8217;s had his repetitious moments, but overall he has more good than bad (the bad is sure to come when you make as many movies as Allen has) and has created a consistent career that is not only respected but beloved.During the aughts, it was thought that Woody was reaching this point in his career where nothing was working as strongly or as fluidly as before.  He was being criticized more than praised and his films just were not making the impact they did in the previous decades.He was hitting a slump.Then he put out &#8216;Match Point&#8217; and the world cried &#8220;Woody Allen comeback&#8221; and he was back in the spotlight.  &#8216;Scoop&#8217; was a critical hiccup, but &#8216;Vicky Cristina Barcelona&#8217; gave him more love, but it was 2011&#8217;s &#8216;Midnight in Paris&#8217; that suddenly made Woody Allen relevant again.  I, personally, didn&#8217;t think the movie was that wonderful (I do consider &#8216;Vicky Cristina Barcelona&#8217; to be a modern masterpiece), but the world did not agree with me and Woody Allen once again found himself an Oscar winner.With this year&#8217;s &#8216;Blue Jasmine&#8217; he has done it again.Is it just me, or does Woody Allen seem to be on a &#8216;good film/bad film&#8217; kind of role here?  Just a point of interest, or discussion, but this seems to be a pattern.Anyways, let&#8217;s talk about &#8216;Blue Jasmine&#8217;.Now, &#8216;Blue Jasmine&#8217; is not perfect, and it is far from Allen&#8217;s best work (it doesn&#8217;t hold a candle to &#8216;Vicky Cristina Barcelona&#8217; or his 80&#8217;s work for that matter) but it holds a certain sense of importance and sheer engagement over the audience.  Most of this is due to Cate Blanchett&#8217;s tour-de-force performance as the emotionally and mentally unstable Jasmine, but Woody&#8217;s biting wit and way with dialog certainly does it&#8217;s fair share of spellbinding.The story is told in fragments as the action shifts from present to past and back again.  We see Jasmine&#8217;s marriage and wealth unfold and crumble and then see her current state of wellness take a turn for the better, seemingly, as she tries to rebuild her life with her adopted sister Ginger.On the one hand, we have the story of Jasmine&#8217;s marriage to wealthy businessman and philandering crook Hal.  Jasmine is selfish, snooty and smothered in jewelry, furs and designer bags.  Her husband sleeps with everything that moves, and does so under the ignorance (possibly intentional) of his doting wife.  Behind the scenes, Hal is stealing money, and while others suspect it, Jasmine decides to ignore it.We shoot forward to after Hal&#8217;s arrest, suicide and Jasmine&#8217;s destitution.  She has no money and is forced to move in with her sister Ginger, who lives in San Francisco.  The two have not been close for years, mainly due to Jasmine&#8217;s arrogance and refusal to embrace her sister and her seeming low standards.  Jasmine hated her first husband, resented her lack of means and finds her sense of humor embarrassing.  Now though, she needs to lean on someone.  She moves in, which upsets Ginger&#8217;s boyfriend Chili (who was planning on moving in with her) and so he is quick to try and get Jasmine to move on with her life.  The problem is, the stress has caused Jasmine to suffer a nervous breakdown and so her material loss is not her only obstacle.She is going crazy.There are no easy answers in &#8216;Blue Jasmine&#8217;.  The finale doesn&#8217;t feel like a conclusion but more like a cliffhanger as we are left to wonder exactly where Jasmine is going to end up.  Will she ever pull herself together?  Will she ever find happiness?  Is she destined to become a crazy park bench cat lady who talks to herself and is made fun of by passersby?  While the film offer no easy answers, it does offer up a lot of easy (or maybe I should say &#8216;lazy&#8217;) observations.  I have two criticisms of this film (just two) and this is the first one.  All those claiming that &#8216;Fruitvale Station&#8217; was too obvious really should watch this film and see what obvious is all about.  The browbeating of &#8216;the grass is not always greener on the other side&#8217; and &#8216;money is the root of all evil&#8217; is VERY dominant here and it bleeds into every subplot.  Making this all the more obvious is the stereotypical treatment of every man in the film (my second criticism).  By giving no depth to Hal, Chili, Al, Dr. Flicker or Dwight (Augie is an exception), Woody Allen failed to completely flesh out his themes in a way that felt more than one-sided.  I&#8217;ve had this issue with Allen before (my major complaint with &#8216;Husbands and Wives&#8217; was that it felt completely one-sided and lacked shared responsibility).Still, these complaints do not take away entirely from the film.  They merely knock it down from a superb film to a merely great one.Blanchett weaves through Allen&#8217;s dialog with so much ease, and she filters her emotional fluctuations with a brilliant sense of raw honesty.  This is clearly one of her finest moments and it may be one of Allen&#8217;s greatest character creations as well.  The fragility and hardness meld together into this explosive presence that one will not soon forget.  Her monologues, her mental frailties, her hysterical breakdowns; all of them could have veered into camp and yet her handling of every moment feels so grounded in Woody&#8217;s themes and tones that she feels honest and relatable.  You can believe her.  Sally Hawkins is also stupendous here.  She is the perfect counterbalance to Blanchett.  She makes Ginger feel earnest and genuine in her concern and her growing insecurities and doubts.  As Jasmine unloads judgment on her, she begins to question her life choices and you bite into every question in her eyes.My only wish is that the sea of tremendous male talent was used to better effect.  Alec Baldwin, Michael Stuhlbarg and Bobby Cannavale are mere caricatures.  While it is nice to see Peter Sarsgaard step away from playing a sleazy jerk, he is given like three scenes and he&#8217;s swallowed by Blanchett in every one.  Louis C.K. could have developed something special, but his screen time is also very limited.  Andrew Dice Clay is the only man here to rise above and give us something that feels three dimensional.  While his scenes are few, you can feel the earthy rawness of this man who is gruff on the outside yet extremely human underneath.At the end of the day, I really enjoyed this despite my reservations.  I wish that it hadn&#8217;t been so obvious in its message and yet, the good here outweighs the bad in my eyes.",4,Blanchett + Allen = Brilliance!,1386028800,"12 3, 2013",2013,7228,"['Woody', 'Allen',

But then again, San Francisco was fine by me; I noticed a lot of sights that I've been to while living and visiting the ""City by the Bay"" for the past three years.Everyone talks about Cate Blanchett's performance here, and yes, once again, she does give a great performance.  But would you expect anything less?  But in reality, one of the most inspired acting choices in history -- Andrew Dice Clay!  Whoda thunk it?  Well, Woody Allen! -- just rocks and rolls here as a transplanted-most-likely-ex-Jersey guy.  He may be an ex-comic, but his schtick still makes me laugh, and I was laughing the whole time that he appeared on screen.  I kept waiting for him to reach one hand around his head and put a cigarette in his mouth with that hand, but he never did it.  Most likely, he did while shooting, and Mr. Allen said, ""Ah, let's try that one again. . . ""And in reality, this is probably Mr. Allen's funniest film in years.  While I like the film ""Annie Hall,"" my favorite has always probably been ""Sleeper.""  I've seen that film quite a few times, and I still always laugh.  As a matter of fact, I think that Mr. Allen was slightly ahead of his time with some of that story, as some of the plot elements -- cloning, robots, etc. -- are now almost old hat.  (Alright.  No one has built a truly decent robot yet.  But someone will, and soon.)This film shows how fate can truly play a part in one's life.  People really don't realize how close they are between being famous and being a goat; how close they are between being rich and being poor; and what a small sliver there is between hanging out in a mansion in Sausalito with a drink in hand, or sitting on a park bench babbling to oneself in San Francisco.  We see that first hand here with Ms. Blanchett, and she always remains just barely more than a sympathetic character no matter what ""role"" she's playing at any given moment, or what person she's hurting, or has hurt, in her past.I'll give a big recommendation on one of Mr. Allen's best films in years, maybe even best ever.

Blanche started out refined in a grand old estate.  but she and it fell on hard times. Jasmine and her sister were both adopted children with Jasmine being mistaken as the ""good"" child because of her blonde good looks and perfect grades. jasmine is not a sympathetic character at all whereas Blanche was sympathetic at times. one major thing the two versions have in common is that the female leads do the acting jobs of a lifetime.  in the STREETCAR film it was Vivien Leigh as Blanche, who won her second Oscar for it (first was GONE WITH THE WIND). if Cate Blanchett does not win for her tour de force performance as Jasmine, the academy should go out of the film business. Woody Allen continues to write roles for women which are incredible. this reminds me of the Geraldine page performance in his INTERIORS or the Gena Rowland's performance in ANOTHER WOMAN.outstanding work is also done by the supporting cast. Alec Baldwin is perfect in the ""Bernie"" role as is Bobby Canavale in the Brando role (which is a much lesser role in this film). Louis C.K., the stand up comic, shows he can really act, as does another standup comic, Andrew Dice Clay, both involved with the sister. the sister is very like the sister in STREETCAR and the actress plays her perfectly.  Finally, one of my favorite actors, Peter Sarsgard does an excellent job as the man jasmine is trying to seduce into marriage to solve all of her problems. this was the role played by Karl Malden in STREETCAR. blanche dated him as a possible way out from her problems.the immortal line used in Streetcar, by Blanche, ""I have always depended on the kindness of strangers,"" is not used in this film but you will hear it nonetheless... loud and clear... that is all Jasmine has left, just like Blanche did.",5,a variation on Tennessee Williams's STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE,1389312000,"01 10, 2014",2014,2774,"['sometimes', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'screenplays', 'works', 'already', 'existence', 'other', 'times', 'screenplay', 'wholly', 'own', 'screenplay', 'extended', 'jazz', 'riff', 'one', 'best', 'American', 'stage', 'plays', 'then', 'films', 'ever', 'existed', 'A', 'STREETCAR', 'NAMED', 'DESIRE', 'play', 'Blanche', 'life', 'tatters', 'moves', 'sister', 'lost', 'everything', 'sister', 'married', 'brutish', 'sensual', 'man', 'Stanley', 'Kowalsky', 'immortalized', 'marlon', 'Brando', 'blanche', 'mental', 'state', 'precarious', 'best', 'mistake', 'attacking', 'Stanley', 'belittling', 'sister', 'set', 'shortly', 'WW', 'II', 'New', 'Orleans', '2013', 'update', 'play.one', 'major', 'difference', 'Jasmine', 'married', 'money', 'rich', 'crook', 'Bernie', 'Madoff', 'style', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'riches', 'alone', 'are', 'not', 'what', 'motivated', 'Blanche', 'certainly', 'would', 'help', 'achieve', 'what', 'wanted', 'was', 'southern', 'hothouse', 'flower', 'who', 'lived', 'refinement', 'being', 'Belle', 'South', 'Blanche', 'started', 'out', 'refined', 'grand', 'old', 'estate', 'fell', 'hard', 'times', 'Jasmine', 'sister', 'were', 'adopted', 'children', 'Jasmine', 'being', 'mistaken', 'good', 'child', 'blonde', 'good', 'looks', 'perfect', 'grades', 'jasmine', 'not', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'whereas', 'Blanche', 'was', 'sympathetic', 'times', 'one', 'major', 'thing', 'two', 'versions', 'have', 'common', 'female', 'leads', 'do', 'acting', 'jobs', 'lifetime', 'STREETCAR', 'film', 'was', 'Vivien', 'Leigh', 'Blanche', 'who', 'won', 'second', 'Oscar', 'first', 'was', 'GONE', 'WITH', 'THE', 'WIND', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'not', 'win', 'tour', 'force', 'performance', 'Jasmine', 'academy', 'should', 'go', 'film', 'business', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'write', 'roles', 'women', 'are', 'incredible', 'Geraldine', 'page', 'performance', 'INTERIORS', 'Gena', 'Rowland', 'performance', 'ANOTHER', 'WOMAN.outstanding', 'work', 'also', 'done', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'perfect', 'Bernie', 'role', 'Bobby', 'Canavale', 'Brando', 'role', 'much', 'lesser', 'role', 'film', 'Louis', 'C.K.', 'stand', 'up', 'comic', 'can', 'really', 'act', 'standup', 'comic', 'Andrew', 'Dice', 'Clay', 'involved', 'sister', 'sister', 'very', 'sister', 'STREETCAR', 'actress', 'perfectly', 'Finally', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'Peter', 'Sarsgard', 'excellent', 'job', 'man', 'jasmine', 'trying', 'seduce', 'marriage', 'solve', 'problems', 'was', 'role', 'played', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'STREETCAR', 'blanche', 'dated', 'possible', 'way', 'problems.the', 'immortal', 'line', 'used', 'Streetcar', 'Blanche', 'have', 'always', 'depended', 'kindness', 'strangers', 'not', 'used', 'film', 'will', 'hear', 'nonetheless', 'loud', 'clear', 'Jasmine', 'left', 'just', 'Blanche', 'did']",Blue Jasmine

First off, it's not a laugh-out-loud comedy (though it does have its funny moments).  I would describe this as a melodrama that provides an inside glimpse into the stunningly different worlds that people inhabit that are galaxies apart due to class divisions, mores, anxieties, and neurosis.And yet, at the same time it's about universal qualities of being that are common to us all: to be liked, to be respected, to accomplish, to be validated, and to be honest. The quest for the perfect partner.  Well, maybe not perfect.  Maybe not even faithful.  Simply authentic?All the performances are good.  The music is jazzily tongue in cheek.  The costumes and sets are perfect.  The plot is intriguing.  THE PRIMARY REASON YOU MUST SEE THIS FILM, however,  IS FOR THE OUTSTANDING JOB DONE BY CATE BLANCHETT.  It's nuanced, realistic, and nothing short of Oscar award winning.  Her performance keeps the pace, the surprise,  and takes the audience from one emotional spectrum to another that will have you reflecting on her character well after the credits roll.  Definitely worth repeat viewings.  Simply excellent (despite Allen and his gimmicky directing esp w/the overuse of flashbacks and the one dimensional treatment of Baldwin's character).",5,"There's only so many traumas a person can take, and we watch them all",1393113600,"02 23, 2014",2014,1349,"[""'ll"", 'admit', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'nearly', 'missed', 'gem', 'movie', 'First', 'not', 'laugh-out-loud', 'comedy', 'have', 'funny', 'moments', 'would', 'describe', 'melodrama', 'inside', 'glimpse', 'stunningly', 'different', 'worlds', 'people', 'inhabit', 'are', 'galaxies', 'apart', 'due', 'class', 'divisions', 'mores', 'anxieties', 'neurosis.And', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'universal', 'qualities', 'being', 'are', 'common', 'be', 'liked', 'be', 'respected', 'accomplish', 'be', 'validated', 'be', 'honest', 'quest', 'perfect', 'partner', 'Well', 'maybe', 'not', 'perfect', 'Maybe', 'not', 'even', 'faithful', 'Simply', 'authentic', 'performances', 'are', 'good', 'music', 'jazzily', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'costumes', 'sets', 'are', 'perfect', 'plot', 'intriguing', 'PRIMARY', 'REASON', 'YOU', 'MUST', 'SEE', 'THIS', 'FILM', 'however', 'IS', 'FOR', 'THE', 'OUTSTANDING', 'JOB', 'DONE', 'BY', 'CATE', 'BLANCHETT', 'nuanced', 'realistic', 'nothing', 'short', 'Oscar', 'award', 'winning', 'performance', 'pace', 'surprise', 'audience', 'one', 'emotional', 'spectrum', 'will', 'have', 'reflecting', 'character', 'well', 'credits', 'roll', 'Definitely', 'worth', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'Simply', 'excellent', 'Allen', 'gimmicky', 'directing', 'esp', 'w/the', 'overuse', 'flashbacks', 'one', 'dimensional', 'treatment', 'Baldwin', 'character']",Blue Jasmine

Also, I'll admit I'm from New Orleans and have gotten a bit jaded with Streetcar Named Desire, but I wasn't thrilled with the story of Blanche Dubois in New York, sounding like Woody Allen.

All of us agreed it was a downer, but there was no doubt in my mind that Cate Blanchett was headed for an Oscar. No doubt, she deserved it. The question of my mind was why did Allen try perhaps the bleakest film of his career after three breezy comedies (Vicky-Cristina Barcelona, Midnight in Paris, to Rome with Love) more in line with his usual fare--and those after the notable The Match Point, a post-Dostoyevskian tale of crime and punishment. At least the latter was enjoyable, even more so because of the golden Caruso-laden arias in the soundtrack. Blue Jasmine had echoes of Blanche DuBois (but no Marlon Brandon in this), but the whole plot limped and the ending had no ""lift"" for the viewer. Perhaps Woody, as he had done so often, wanted to remind us that, although he does not belong in Hollywood (and truly bitter about it) that he is still the greatest American filmmaker, when he chooses to prove his point--and that the rest of us are too moronic to capture all his nuances. I have been his follower in the past four decades, and am always curious to know what he has concocted. But I think, at this point, he has already proved--of failed to do so--what he really is: great when he does something like Midnight in Paris, with its multi-layered past/present illusions, a bit malice here and there, airheaded-ness to the max, attack on crashing bores, and disillusion with the institution of marriage--ditch it on occasion for romantic love. Not all America listens to him. But those who do find his occasional gems redeeming.

1657855,A2RLK9KKVGEETZ,B00DL47RQ2,"C. Tsao ""Seaview1""","[3, 5]","Woody Allen has evolved from writer/director and sometime actor of comedies to dark dramas and various permutations.  Besides being one of the most prolific artists in moviemaking history, most of his films have been marked by strong storylines populated with colorful characters, sharp dialogue, and often ironic endings. Blue Jasmine is the latest film to showcase Allen's talent (yes at 77 he is very much in command of his medium), and he gets a bravura performance by Cate Blanchett.Jasmine (Blanchett) is a flamboyant soul who is flying from New York to San Francisco to stay with her sister, Ginger (Sally Hawkins).  Married to a successful businessman, Hal (Alec Baldwin), Jasmine has a life of high society and wealth.  But Hal is not what he seems, and she experiences the fallout from his womanizing and crooked investments.  This sets off a chain reaction of loss for the now penniless wife and mother.  Now dependent on the kindness of her sister who lost a life savings courtesy of Hal, she tries to find employment at a dentist office and take classes to find a career.  She is desperate and dependent on others, and when she meets Dwight (Peter Sarsgaard), the man of her dreams, the only thing between herself and nirvana is her hidden past.How to describe Jasmine? She is self absorbed, selfish, despondent, manic, alcoholic, vain, delusional, traumatized, judgmental, spoiled, and above all, depressed.  She is oblivious to the obvious and in denial of her reality.  Mentally unhinged and humiliated, she is a walking contradiction who indulges in lies and babbles to herself.The film employs stream of consciousness flashbacks that may seem abrupt at first, but you quickly see the device as a rapid succession of background information on how Jasmine's life has been filled with status and means only to devolve as Hal's philandering history is revealed.Allen has a gift for observing and depicting real people in conflict.  Both sisters come from different walks of life.  Both yearn for happiness, and yet when Jasmine falls on hard times, Ginger is there for her despite a rocky history together. There are obvious class divisions between the rich and poor, and the irony here is that Jasmine is now one of the latter.  There are obvious parallels to A Streetcar Named Desire, but Jasmine just might be more disturbed than Blanche DuBois.  In fact a case can be made that Jasmine will evolve into a character not unlike Judi Dench's pathetic spinster in Notes on a Scandal (also starring Blanchett).Kudos go to the usual Allen ensemble of top performers particularly Hawkins as the charitable sibling and Baldwin as a Bernie Madoff /Casanova.  Andrew Dice Clay has a supporting role as a man from Ginger's past who figures prominently later, and Louis C. K. is convincing as a romantic suitor who diverts Ginger from her boyfriend Chili (Bobby Cannavale).  But Blanchett inhabits her role in an eerie way; you believe her and all her quirks and mannerisms.  She is a mess of a person, and her struggles to find happiness and financial security are fleeting.  It's the sort of performance that earns an actress the Oscar.It is nice to see Allen expand his films' settings from his traditional New York environs to other locales, lately Europe and now San Francisco.  The film is beautifully shot in New York and California by Javier Aguirresarobe (Vicki Cristina Barcelona).  As usual, Allen employs period songs to accent a mood or scene especially the ironic tune ""A Good Man Is Hard to Find"".As with the best Allen dramas like Interiors, Crimes and Misdemeanors and Match Point, the lead characters are imperfect people with serious problems, and it causes them to do desperate things that don't always work.  Allen does not always have happy endings in his dramas, and you get the impression that this story may not end well.  Life can be cruel, and in Blue Jasmine, how we deal with it can be a tortuous journey.",4,Blue Jasmine's Fall from Grace,1378425600,"09 6, 2013",2013,3940,"['Woody', 'Allen', 'evolved', 'writer/director', 'sometime', 'actor', 'comedies', 'dark', 'dramas', 'various', 'permutations', 'being', 'one', 'most', 'prolific', 'artists', 'moviemaking', 'history', 'most', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'marked', 'strong', 'storylines', 'populated', 'colorful', 'characters', 'sharp', 'dialogue', 'often', 'ironic', 'endings', 'Blue', 'Jasmine', 'latest', 'film', 'showcase', 'Allen', 'talent', 'yes', '77', 'very', 'much', 'command', 'medium', 'bravura', 'performance', 'Cate', 'Blanchett.Jasmine', 'Blanchett', 'flamboyant', 'soul', 'who', 'flying', 'New', 'York', 'San', 'Francisco', 'stay', 'sister', 'Ginger', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'Married', 'successful', 'businessman', 'Hal', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Jasmine', 'life', 'high', 'society', 'wealth', 'Hal', 'not', 'what', 'fallout', 'womanizing', 'crooked', 'investments', 'off', 'chain', 'reaction', 'loss', 'now', 'penniless', 'wife', 'mother', 'Now', 'dependent', 'kindness', 'sister', 'who', 'lost', 'life', 'savings', 'courtesy', 'Hal', 'find', 'employment', 'dentist', 'office', 'take', 'classes', 'find', 'career', 'desperate', 'dependent', 'others', 'when', 'Dwight', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'man', 'dreams', 'only', 'thing', 'herself', 'nirvana', 'hidden', 'past.How', 'describe', 'Jasmine', 'self', 'absorbed', 'selfish', 'despondent', 'manic', 'alcoholic', 'vain', 'delusional', 'traumatized', 'judgmental', 'spoiled', 'depressed', 'oblivious', 'obvious', 'denial', 'reality', 'Mentally', 'unhinged', 'humiliated', 'walking', 'contradiction', 'who', 'lies', 'babbles', 'herself.The', 'film', 'stream', 'consciousness', 'flashbacks', 'may', 'seem', 'abrupt', 'first', 'quickly', 'see', 'device', 'rapid', 'succession', 'background', 'information', 'how', 'Jasmine', 'life', 'been', 'filled', 'status', 'only', 'devolve', 'Hal', 'philandering', 'history', 'revealed.Allen', 'gift', 'observing', 'depicting', 'real', 'people', 'conflict', 'sisters', 'come', 'different', 'walks', 'life', 'yearn', 'happiness', 'yet', 'when', 'Jasmine', 'hard', 'times', 'Ginger', 'there', 'rocky', 'history', 'together', 'are', 'obvious', 'class', 'divisions', 'rich', 'poor', 'irony', 'here', 'Jasmine', 'now', 'one', 'latter', 'are', 'obvious', 'parallels', 'Streetcar', 'Named', 'Desire', 'Jasmine', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'disturbed', 'Blanche', 'DuBois', 'fact', 'case', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'Jasmine', 'will', 'evolve', 'character', 'not', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'pathetic', 'spinster', 'Notes', 'Scandal', 'also', 'starring', 'Blanchett', '.Kudos', 'go', 'usual', 'Allen', 'ensemble', 'top', 'performers', 'particularly', 'charitable', 'sibling', 'Baldwin', 'Bernie', 'Madoff', '/Casanova', 'Andrew', 'Dice', 'Clay', 'supporting', 'role', 'man', 'Ginger', 'past', 'who', 'prominently', 'later', 'Louis', 'C.', 'K.', 'convincing', 'romantic', 'suitor', 'who', 'Ginger', 'boyfriend', 'Chili', 'Bobby', 'Cannavale', 'Blanchett', 'role', 'eerie', 'way', 'believe', 'quirks', 'mannerisms', 'mess', 'person', 'struggles', 'find', 'happiness', 'financial', 'security', 'are', 'fleeting', 'sort', 'performance', 'actress', 'Oscar.It', 'nice', 'see', 'Allen', 'expand', 'films', 'settings', 'traditional', 'New', 'York', 'environs', 'other', 'locales', 'lately', 'Europe', 'now', 'San', 'Francisco', 'film', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'New', 'York', 'California', 'Javier', 'Aguirresarobe', 'Vicki', 'Cristina', 'Barcelona', 'usual', 'Allen', 'period', 'songs', 'accent', 'mood', 'scene', 'especially', 'ironic', 'tune', 'Good', 'Man', 'Hard', 'Find', '.As', 'best', 'Allen', 'dramas', 'Interiors', 'Crimes', 'Misdemeanors', 'Match', 'Point', 'lead', 'characters', 'are', 'imperfect', 'people', 'serious', 'problems', 'do', 'desperate', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'work', 'Allen', 'not', 'always', 'have', 'happy', 'endings', 'dramas', 'get', 'impression', 'story', 'may', 'not', 'end', 'well', 'Life', 'can', 'be', 'cruel', 'Blue', 'Jasmine', 'how', 'deal', 'can', 'be', 'tortuous', 'journey']",Blue Jasmine

Madigan,"[3, 6]","Cate Blanchett gives one of the most riveting performances I have not seen since Nicole Kidman in The Hours.Blanchett embodies this lost woman so toatlly it makes one want to walk into the screen and help her,listen to her...like the Purple Rose of Cairo (a Woody Allen filmwhere fan Mia Farrow walks into the film...repeatedly)It is a homage to A Streecar Named Desire, and it is done with subtety and a pathos that Allen is expert at, so that we are taken further into this woman's damaged spirit almost at once..npt more so than Blanche Dubis, but in a new ligjt, woith new angles and new visons for the camera to see. and for us to imbibe in.Allen captures the hectic pace of America, the nonsensical things done to survive, the lust for money in order to buy chic clothes and au current breads, teas, and Starbuck coffees.  Jasmine loses her money and she helplessly descends into hell.This film reminded me of Allen's brilliant Interiors, often overlooked, especially the character Geraldine Page plays with such magnificence..lost in her beiges and blacks and her earth tone colors for interiors of holuses and apartments. Even her attempted suicide is &#34;decorated&#34; and her final dsecent into the gray ocean somehow has her imperious hand in the arrangement of things.Jasmine is less neurotic, funnier, frank, but lost without the luxuries thatg sustained her..she has a low spirit , not very high vibfrations to pull her through. She needs mobility, frantic changes, as does Page in the above mentioned film.As with Page Jasmine has a sick spirit within her, a clouding of her potentials done to her by obsessive compulsive needing and getting and then losing everything. Her sanity had depended on poses, attitudes, ruses, masques, and now they are lifted and what is seen is a desperate character in need of almost everything.I love Jasmine as a person..she carries the cross for us all, like Blanche Dubois, she reveals the reasons why there is ultimately only a grand silence out there for all of us who feel and think and trust.As always with Mr. Allen, art saves us; it is the only life preserver that can  keep us dignified until final, unsullied dissolution.",5,Great film!!!,1389571200,"01 13, 2014",2014,2181,"['Cate', 'Blanchett', 'one', 'most', 'riveting', 'performances', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Hours.Blanchett', 'lost', 'woman', 'so', 'toatlly', 'one', 'want', 'walk', 'screen', 'help', 'Purple', 'Rose', 'Cairo', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'filmwhere', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'film', 'repeatedly', 'homage', 'Streecar', 'Named', 'Desire', 'done', 'subtety', 'pathos', 'Allen', 'expert', 'are', 'taken', 'further', 'woman', 'damaged', 'spirit', 'almost', 'more', 'so', 'Blanche', 'Dubis', 'new', 'ligjt', 'woith', 'new', 'angles', 'new', 'visons', 'camera', 'see', 'imbibe', 'in.Allen', 'captures', 'hectic', 'pace', 'America', 'nonsensical', 'things', 'done', 'survive', 'lust', 'money', 'order', 'buy', 'chic', 'clothes', 'au', 'current', 'breads', 'teas', 'Starbuck', 'coffees', 'Jasmine', 'money', 'helplessly', 'hell.This', 'film', 'reminded', 'Allen', 'brilliant', 'Interiors', 'often', 'overlooked', 'especially', 'character', 'Geraldine', 'Page', 'such', 'magnificence..lost', 'beiges', 'blacks', 'earth', 'tone', 'colors', 'interiors', 'holuses', 'apartments', 'Even', 'attempted', 'suicide', '34', 'decorated', '34', 'final', 'dsecent', 'gray', 'ocean', 'somehow', 'imperious', 'hand', 'arrangement', 'things.Jasmine', 'less', 'neurotic', 'funnier', 'frank', 'lost', 'luxuries', 'thatg', 'sustained', 'her..she', 'low', 'spirit', 'not', 'very', 'high', 'vibfrations', 'pull', 'mobility', 'frantic', 'changes', 'Page', 'above', 'mentioned', 'film.As', 'Page', 'Jasmine', 'sick', 'spirit', 'clouding', 'potentials', 'done', 'obsessive', 'compulsive', 'needing', 'getting', 'then', 'losing', 'everything', 'sanity', 'had', 'depended', 'poses', 'attitudes', 'ruses', 'masques', 'now', 'are', 'lifted', 'what', 'seen', 'desperate', 'character', 'need', 'almost', 'everything.I', 'love', 'Jasmine', 'person..she', 'cross', 'Blanche', 'Dubois', 'reasons', 'why', 'ultimately', 'only', 'grand', 'silence', 'there', 'who', 'feel', 'think', 'trust.As', 'always', 'Mr.', 'Allen', 'art', 'saves', 'only', 'life', 'can', 'keep', 'dignified', 'final', 'unsullied', 'dissolution']",Blue Jasmine

This review reveals key plot points. Don't read this review if you don't want to know what happens. Let's face it, though, not a lot happens in ""Blue Jasmine."" What does happen onscreen is devoid of artistic truth, verisimilitude, insight or craft.Jasmine (Cate Blanchett) is the beautiful widow of Hal Francis, a Bernie-Madoff like corrupt wheeler-dealer. The FBI has caught up with Hal and arrested him. He commits suicide in prison. Jasmine travels from NYC to San Francisco to live with her sister, Ginger (Sally Hawkins). Ginger used to be married to Augie (Andrew Dice Clay) but Ginger is currently involved with Chili (Bobby Cannavale.)Jasmine tries to make a go of it. There is some tension as she is living in her sister's apartment. Jasmine gets a job, meets a man, and studies interior decorating. Things go badly and the movie ends exactly as it begins: with Jasmine talking to herself.And that's it. That's the entire waste-of-your-time movie.The premise is tremendous: how the wife of a Bernie-Madoff style wheeler dealer copes with her sudden stratospheric loss of income and prestige. Does she sink or swim? Is she redeemed or doomed? ""Blue Jasmine"" does nothing with those fascinating questions. Things are at the end of the movie exactly as they were at the beginning.Woody Allen wrote a lifeless, inept script.Allen tosses one potential plot element into the film after another: the aforementioned loss of money and status, mental illness, abusive relationships, adultery, prescription drugs, class relations, sister relationships, adoption, step parenting, sexual harassment at the workplace. Then Allen does absolutely nothing with any of these.We see Hal kissing women not his wife. We see Augie talking to Hal about money. We see working class people drinking beer and watching sports on TV. None of this goes anywhere. It's all just aborted, disjointed scenes with zero verisimilitude; hollow scenes that arouse not one whit of care or involvement. I didn't believe anything in this movie. Every character's dialogue sounds so similar that I was painfully aware that it was not real people's speech, but words written by Woody Allen. Events occur with no believability.Jasmine drops a dime on Hal as soon as he tells her that he wants to leave her for another woman. A con artist of Hal's magnitude would not do something so nave as to tell his wife, who knows of his financial misdeeds, that he is going to dump her. She would obviously get revenge the only way she can - by immediately phoning the FBI.Ginger is a two dimensional character. No reason is given for her to do anything she does, including taking in Jasmine. Jasmine had been rude to her earlier in the film, and Ginger is not a particularly nice person. The movie takes pains to tell us that Jasmine and Ginger were adopted, and this information serves no point whatsoever. There's no reason for Ginger to have two men: Augie and Chili are virtually the same character. Jasmine has a step son; there's no reason for him not to be her real son.The movie tells us that Jasmine is on edge, alone and without resources. The movie lies; in other scenes, the movie tells us that Jasmine is utterly irresistible to men. Every man she meets wants to make love to her, date her, and marry her. Surely one of Hal's friends, as soon as Hal went to prison, would have scooped up luscious Jasmine, and Jasmine would have accepted.The movie tells us that Jasmine is the kind of resourceful woman who can be born poor and marry one of the richest men in the country. How did that change and how did Jasmine become a pathetic basket case? It's just not believable.A diplomat proposes marriage to Jasmine after dating her for about fifteen minutes. Not believable. Then he immediately cancels the engagement because Jasmine is not what he had thought. Also not believable.It's impossible to care about any of the characters in the film, from the smarmy dentist to the diplomat who proposes to Jasmine, not just because none of them are nice or even rational people, but because they are boring, two dimensional, and lifeless.Cate Blanchett's performance is excellent. I did get sick of the tic Allen had her, or allowed her, to perform over and over: shaking Xanax tablets out of a brown prescription bottle into her hand and swallowing them down, followed by a swig of vodka. This gesture was repeated so many times it became stale. Yes, yes, we get it - Jasmine is a nervous wreck.This movie bugs me because it is so amazingly badly made. The most basic manual on how to construct a plot or develop a character would have steered Allen away from the choices he made. I'm angry that reviewers gave his mess a thumb's up. It's troubling that there are gifted scriptwriters out there who can't get produced while Allen's big name lures filmgoers.",1,Inept Filmmaking that Cheats the Moviegoer,1379203200,"09 15,

1657861,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B00DL47RQ2,David Baldwin,"[1, 2]","Woody Allen has always been enigmatic to me.  He's made absolutely brilliant films like &#34;Bananas&#34;, &#34;Manhattan&#34;, &#34;Crimes and Misdemeanors&#34;, and &#34;Bullets Over Broadway&#34;.  Good ones like &#34;Radio Days&#34; and &#34;Mighty Aphrodite&#34;.  Overrated ones like &#34;Annie Hall&#34; and &#34;Midnight in Paris&#34;.  Terrible ones like &#34;Celebrity&#34; and &#34;Melinda and Melinda&#34;.  He even repeated himself with &#34;Match Point&#34; which was wholly derivative of &#34;Crimes and Misdemeanors&#34;.  Despite the unevenness of his output you cannot deny his artistry.  This frustration with Allen made &#34;Blue Jasmine&#34; a complete surprise to me.  It is a virtually flawless film.  Unlike past endeavors Allen isn't repeating himself but actually treading new ground as a filmmaker which is amazing when you consider that he is in the twilight of his years.  Sure the black-and-white opening credits heralding the cast in alphabetic order are there and the old time blues standards trumpeted on the soundtrack is present but other than that you wouldn't know this is a Woody Allen film.  The structure of the film is ingenious the way Allen flashes back in forth in time allowing us to see how Jasmine(Cate Blanchett) fell from grace in her old life as a New York socialite and is headed for the same fate in her new life in San Francisco.  Allen is abetted by probably the best cast he's assembled in years led by Blanchett who is nothing short of a wonder for her work here.  Your jaw will drop watching Blanchett walk and talk and pop Xanax like they were Tic Tacs.  Anybody who can make you sympathize for a self-absorbed snob is deserving of an Oscar.  Sally Hawkins offers terrific support as Jasmine's blue collar sister, Ginger.  And who would have thought that casting Andrew Dice Clay and Louis C.K. in a Woody Allen film would be a stroke of genius?.  &#34;Blue Jasmine&#34; defies easy categorization because it takes such an ironic look at the human condition that you laugh between the tears.",5,Woody's First Masterpiece In Years,1393113600,"02 23, 2014",2014,2049,"['Woody', 'Allen', 'always', 'been', 'enigmatic', 'made', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'films', '34', 'Bananas', '34', '34', 'Manhattan', '34', '34', 'Crimes', 'Misdemeanors', '34', '34', 'Bullets', 'Broadway', '34', 'Good', 'ones', '34', 'Radio', 'Days', '34', '34', 'Mighty', 'Aphrodite', '34', 'Overrated', 'ones', '34', 'Annie', 'Hall', '34', '34', 'Midnight', 'Paris', '34', 'Terrible', 'ones', '34', 'Celebrity', '34', '34', 'Melinda', 'Melinda', '34', 'even', 'repeated', '34', 'Match', 'Point', '34', 'was', 'wholly', 'derivative', '34', 'Crimes', 'Misdemeanors', '34', 'unevenness', 'output', 'can', 'not', 'deny', 'artistry', 'frustration', 'Allen', 'made', '34', 'Blue', 'Jasmine', '34', 'complete', 'surprise', 'virtually', 'flawless', 'film', 'past', 'endeavors', 'Allen', ""n't"", 'repeating', 'actually', 'treading', 'new', 'ground', 'filmmaker', 'amazing', 'when', 'consider', 'twilight', 'years', 'Sure', 'black-and-white', 'opening', 'credits', 'heralding', 'cast', 'alphabetic', 'order', 'are', 'there', 'old', 'time', 'blues', 'standards', 'trumpeted', 'soundtrack', 'present', 'other', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'film', 'structure', 'film', 'ingenious', 'way', 'Allen', 'back', 'forth', 'time', 'allowing', 'see', 'how', 'Jasmine', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'fell', 'grace', 'old', 'life', 'New', 'York', 'socialite', 'headed', 'same', 'fate', 'new', 'life', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Allen', 'abetted', 'probably', 'best', 'cast', 'assembled', 'years', 'led', 'Blanchett', 'who', 'nothing', 'short', 'wonder', 'work', 'here', 'jaw', 'will', 'drop', 'watching', 'Blanchett', 'walk', 'talk', 'pop', 'Xanax', 'were', 'Tic', 'Tacs', 'Anybody', 'who', 'can', 'make', 'sympathize', 'self-absorbed', 'snob', 'deserving', 'Oscar', 'Sally', 'offers', 'terrific', 'support', 'Jasmine', 'blue', 'collar', 'sister', 'Ginger', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'casting', 'Andrew', 'Dice', 'Clay', 'Louis', 'C.K', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'stroke', 'genius', '34', 'Blue', 'Jasmine', '34', 'defies', 'easy', 'categorization', 'ironic', 'look', 'human', 'condition', 'laugh', 'tears']",Blue Jasmine
1657862,A35UNON2GI8C0R,B00DL47RQ2,David Kusumoto,"[1, 2]","* There's no need to go into my problems with this film, from its non-linear structure - to its jarring Jersey accents in a San Francisco setting - to its ""perky"" jazz soundtrack laid over scenes of emotional trauma.* However, for viewers upset about the darkness throughout this film, and its lack of an emotionally satisfying ending, or more to the point, the lack of any ending at all, I say it's better to frame this picture as a portrait of desperation, of how you can be wealthy with status and condescension towards others - and still end up being mentally ill, hooked on pills and alcohol, mumbling to yourself on a park bench, shunned by strangers.* The last shot in ""Blue Jasmine"" felt stunning to me, the irrationality of what Jasmine (Cate Blanchett) says, how she says it - juxtaposed with how raggedly terrible and old she looks after appearing spectacularly elegant throughout the film.  In my view, how a second person in that last shot behaves toward Jasmine, without saying one word - before the screen goes suddenly black - told me enough about what's going to happen to Jasmine, without needing to see it.  The decision to NOT ""tie up loose ends"" feels intentional, leaving some viewers justifiably angry about being deprived an ending.* I don't think it's helpful to compare this movie to ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" - nor to read national critics praising this film.  Expectations matter.  Your complaints are justified.  To me, ""Blue Jasmine"" is a sketchy story about how an unlikeable and snobby woman - after losing all of her money - will do ANYTHING to climb her way back up the status ladder.  It's one version of how quickly a person can fall from the penthouse to the outhouse, ending up like some homeless person who looks deranged, doped up and dangerous, babbling to herself - without projecting any suggestion of a past once filled with prestige and glamour.* So who's the real loser if your self-worth is defined by money and material things - and not by love and forgiveness - which Jasmine's sister Ginger (Sally Hawkins) has by the truckload?  Despite the low opinion Jasmine has for ""unsophisticated"" Ginger, who's a single mother living from paycheck-to-paycheck - who dates men who are, in Jasmine's view, ""losers"" - Ginger won't be dragged down.  She may not be rich nor stylish, but you're not going to find Ginger dependent on drugs and alcohol, emotionally devastated and homeless on the streets.* Yeah, Cate Blanchett's performance is electric.  Her facial expressions, her ability to suggest bravado, arrogance and crippling self-doubt - are off the charts spectacular.  I never got the impression she was delivering lines from memory.  The scene where she's ""baby-sitting"" her sister's kids in a restaurant, ""confiding"" shallow pearls of wisdom about the human condition and about her own situation - illustrates the extent of her increasing madness.* But given the rave reviews from critics and the depressingly mixed reactions from audiences, I went in with low expectations.  I'm glad I did.  ""Blue Jasmine"" - despite its flaws - is an insanely watchable story about a human train wreck without wheels.",4,The fine line between being rich - and being doped up and homeless.,1391904000,"02 9, 2014",2014,3152,"['*', 'need', 'go', 'problems', 'film', 'non-linear', 'structure', 'jarring', 'Jersey', 'accents', 'San', 'Francisco', 'setting', 'perky', 'jazz', 'soundtrack', 'laid', 'scenes', 'emotional', 'trauma', '*', 'However', 'viewers', 'upset', 'darkness', 'film', 'lack', 'emotionally', 'satisfying', 'ending', 'more', 'point', 'lack', 'ending', 'say', 'better', 'frame', 'picture', 'portrait', 'desperation', 'how', 'can', 'be', 'wealthy', 'status', 'condescension', 'towards', 'others', 'still', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'mentally', 'ill', 'hooked', 'pills', 'alcohol', 'mumbling', 'yourself', 'park', 'bench', 'shunned', 'strangers', '*', 'last', 'shot', 'Blue', 'Jasmine', 'felt', 'stunning', 'irrationality', 'what', 'Jasmine', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'how', 'juxtaposed', 'how', 'raggedly', 'terrible', 'old', 'appearing', 'spectacularly', 'elegant', 'film', 'view', 'how', 'second', 'person', 'last', 'shot', 'behaves', 'Jasmine', 'saying', 'one', 'word', 'screen', 'suddenly', 'black', 'told', 'enough', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'Jasmine', 'needing', 'see', 'decision', 'NOT', 'tie', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'feels', 'intentional', 'leaving', 'viewers', 'justifiably', 'angry', 'being', 'deprived', 'ending', '*', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'helpful', 'compare', 'movie', 'A', 'Streetcar', 'Named', 'Desire', 'read', 'national', 'critics', 'praising', 'film', 'Expectations', 'matter', 'complaints', 'are', 'justified', 'Blue', 'Jasmine', 'sketchy', 'story', 'how', 'unlikeable', 'snobby', 'woman', 'losing', 'money', 'will', 'do', 'ANYTHING', 'climb', 'way', 'back', 'status', 'ladder', 'one', 'version', 'how', 'quickly', 'person', 'can', 'fall', 'penthouse', 'outhouse', 'ending', 'up', 'homeless', 'person', 'who', 'deranged', 'doped', 'up', 'dangerous', 'babbling', 'herself', 'projecting', 'suggestion', 'past', 'once', 'filled', 'prestige', 'glamour', 'So', 'who', 'real', 'loser', 'self-worth', 'defined', 'money', 'material', 'things', 'not', 'love', 'forgiveness', 'Jasmine', 'sister', 'Ginger', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'truckload', 'low', 'opinion', 'Jasmine', 'unsophisticated', 'Ginger', 'who', 'single', 'mother', 'living', 'paycheck-to-paycheck', 'who', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'Jasmine', 'view', 'losers', 'Ginger', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'dragged', 'down', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'rich', 'stylish', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'find', 'Ginger', 'dependent', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'emotionally', 'devastated', 'homeless', 'streets', '*', 'Yeah', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'performance', 'electric', 'facial', 'expressions', 'ability', 'suggest', 'bravado', 'arrogance', 'crippling', 'self-doubt', 'are', 'charts', 'spectacular', 'never', 'got', 'impression', 'was', 'delivering', 'lines', 'memory', 'scene', 'where', 'baby-sitting', 'sister', 'kids', 'restaurant', 'confiding', 'shallow', 'pearls', 'wisdom', 'human', 'condition', 'own', 'situation', 'extent', 'increasing', 'madness', '*', 'given', 'rave', 'reviews', 'critics', 'depressingly', 'mixed', 'reactions', 'audiences', 'went', 'low', 'expectations', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'Blue', 'Jasmine', 'flaws', 'insanely', 'watchable', 'story', 'human', 'train', 'wreck', 'wheels']",Blue Jasmine

1657881,AC1K4OQOZ90RS,B00DL47RQ2,"E. Bukowsky ""booklover10""","[3, 5]","Woody Allen's ""Blue Jasmine"" is his seriocomic take on a Bernie Madoff-like scam artist named Hal, who cons people out of their savings with smooth-talking charm.  Alec Baldwin plays the narcissistic Hal with his trademark smarminess.  The talented Cate Blanchett is Hal's wife, Jasmine, who is more intelligent that she lets on.  She airily announces to her friends that she routinely turns a blind eye to her husband's dodgy financial affairs.  As time goes by, however, Hal's indiscretions become so blatant that Jasmine can no longer shrug them off.  When she is forced to face some unpleasant truths, she makes a life-changing decision that will have far-reaching consequences.Written and directed by Woody Allen, with a jazz score that underscores the action, ""Blue Jasmine"" features scenes of farcical comedy and heartbreaking tragedy.  Allen shifts back and forth between the ""good"" years--when Hal and Jasmine enjoyed a life of ease and excess--and the aftermath of their downfall. Blanchett hits all the right notes, portraying Jasmine as a woman who regrets having made bad choices but wants desperately to regain her dignity and sanity.  Can she overcome her guilt, confusion, and shattered self-esteem?The humor stems partly from the strained relationship that Jasmine has with her good-hearted but nave sister, Ginger (Sally Hawkins), who is Jasmine's polar opposite.  Although she has ample reason to give Jasmine a wide berth, Ginger, a working class divorc&eacute;e with two kids, graciously welcomes her elegant and beautiful sibling into her apartment.  Jasmine claims to be grateful for her sister's hospitality, but cannot hide her contempt for Ginger's blue-collar lifestyle and loud-mouthed boyfriend. A series of misadventures ensue that are both hilarious and horrible.Blanchette is a scene stealer who is sophisticated and articulate one minute and outrageously scatterbrained the next.  It is hilarious and pathetic to observe her providing the details of her mental deterioration to Ginger's obnoxious sons.  Nor does Jasmine's reliance on Xanax and booze enhance her flawed judgment. Allen's heavy-handed plot has its share of flaws, including some far-fetched and melodramatic elements, but ""Blue Jasmine"" is worth seeing, mostly for Blanchett's stunning and poignant performance. The film is notable, as well, for its satirical, engrossing, and disconcerting exploration of the ways in which greed, selfishness, and stupidity can bring high-flying individuals crashing down to earth.",4,"""There's only so many traumas a person can withstand.""",1392768000,"02 19, 2014",2014,2514,"['Woody', 'Allen', 'Blue', 'Jasmine', 'seriocomic', 'take', 'Bernie', 'Madoff-like', 'scam', 'artist', 'named', 'Hal', 'who', 'people', 'savings', 'smooth-talking', 'charm', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'narcissistic', 'Hal', 'trademark', 'smarminess', 'talented', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'Hal', 'wife', 'Jasmine', 'who', 'more', 'intelligent', 'airily', 'friends', 'routinely', 'blind', 'eye', 'husband', 'dodgy', 'financial', 'affairs', 'time', 'however', 'Hal', 'indiscretions', 'become', 'so', 'blatant', 'Jasmine', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'shrug', 'off', 'When', 'forced', 'face', 'unpleasant', 'truths', 'life-changing', 'decision', 'will', 'have', 'far-reaching', 'consequences.Written', 'directed', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'jazz', 'score', 'action', 'Blue', 'Jasmine', 'scenes', 'farcical', 'comedy', 'heartbreaking', 'tragedy', 'Allen', 'shifts', 'back', 'forth', 'good', 'years', 'when', 'Hal', 'Jasmine', 'enjoyed', 'life', 'ease', 'excess', 'aftermath', 'downfall', 'Blanchett', 'right', 'notes', 'portraying', 'Jasmine', 'woman', 'who', 'having', 'made', 'bad', 'choices', 'desperately', 'regain', 'dignity', 'sanity', 'Can', 'overcome', 'guilt', 'confusion', 'shattered', 'self-esteem', 'humor', 'partly', 'strained', 'relationship', 'Jasmine', 'good-hearted', 'nave', 'sister', 'Ginger', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'who', 'Jasmine', 'polar', 'opposite', 'ample', 'reason', 'give', 'Jasmine', 'wide', 'berth', 'Ginger', 'working', 'class', 'divorc', 'eacute', 'two', 'kids', 'graciously', 'elegant', 'beautiful', 'sibling', 'apartment', 'Jasmine', 'be', 'grateful', 'sister', 'hospitality', 'can', 'not', 'hide', 'contempt', 'Ginger', 'blue-collar', 'lifestyle', 'loud-mouthed', 'boyfriend', 'series', 'misadventures', 'ensue', 'are', 'hilarious', 'horrible.Blanchette', 'scene', 'stealer', 'who', 'sophisticated', 'articulate', 'one', 'minute', 'outrageously', 'scatterbrained', 'next', 'hilarious', 'pathetic', 'observe', 'providing', 'details', 'mental', 'deterioration', 'Ginger', 'obnoxious', 'sons', 'Jasmine', 'reliance', 'Xanax', 'booze', 'enhance', 'flawed', 'judgment', 'Allen', 'heavy-handed', 'plot', 'share', 'flaws', 'including', 'far-fetched', 'melodramatic', 'elements', 'Blue', 'Jasmine', 'worth', 'seeing', 'mostly', 'Blanchett', 'stunning', 'poignant', 'performance', 'film', 'notable', 'as', 'well', 'satirical', 'engrossing', 'disconcerting', 'exploration', 'ways', 'greed', 'selfishness', 'stupidity', 'can', 'bring', 'high-flying', 'individuals', 'crashing', 'down', 'earth']",Blue Jasmine

1657883,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00DL47RQ2,Ed Uyeshima,"[287, 309]","If you want to see this year's master class in screen acting, you need to watch Cate Blanchett's mesmerizing performance as Jasmine French, a delusional Park Avenue socialite wife in Woody Allen's 46th directorial effort, a sly, bicoastal update of Tennessee Williams' classicA Streetcar Named Desire. As the film opens, her impeccably dressed character has hit rock bottom after her financial wizard of a husband is arrested and her assets are liquidated. In the throes of a nervous breakdown, she arrives in San Francisco and moves in with her kind-hearted sister Ginger who lives a modest, blue-collar life in a tiny apartment on the edge of the Mission - on South Van Ness near 14th Street to be exact - with her two hyperactive sons. You can tell Jasmine is not only out of her element but quite judgmental about how her sister's life has turned out. The irony of Jasmine's patronizing attitude is that she is a habitual liar who is so angry about her destitute circumstances that she frequently talks to herself. The story follows the basic outline of ""Streetcar"" but takes some interesting turns, for instance, when she tries to better herself by taking computer classes while working as a receptionist at a dental office.Allen has crafted his film into a clever juxtaposition of current and past events that feels jarring at first since it reflects Jasmine's precarious mental state but then melds into a dramatic arc which resonates far more than a straightforward chronology could have allowed. As a writer, he has become more vociferous in his dialogue without losing his wit. He doesn't pull punches when he showcases confrontations between his characters, whether it's between the two sisters, men and women, or people from different classes. Hostility can come in flammable torrents or in thinly veiled remarks. That Allen moves so dexterously in tone is a testament to his sharp ability in drawing out the truth in his actors. Blanchett is a wonder in this regard because there is something intensely fearless in her approach. Unafraid to lose audience sympathy for her character, she finds an innate sadness in Jasmine that makes us want to know what happens to her next. She also mines the sharp, class-based humor in Jasmine's struggles with one highlight a hilariously executed scene in a pizza restaurant where she explains to her confused nephews to ""Tip big, boys"".The rest of the cast manage effective turns. Alec Baldwin plays Jasmine's swindler husband with almost effortless aplomb. Sally Hawkins brings a wonderful looseness to Ginger, Stella to Blanchett's Blanche, and finds a level of poignancy in her character's constant victimization at the hands of her sister as well as her brutish, blue-collar boyfriend Chili, played with comic fierceness by Bobby Cannavale in the Stanley Kowalski role. In a conveniently conceived role, Peter Sarsgaard gets uncharacteristically breezy as Dwight, a wealthy, erudite, and matrimonially available State Department diplomat who appears to be the answer to Jasmine's prayers, while Allen casts two unlikely comics in about-face roles - Andrew Dice Clay as Ginger's defeated ex-husband Augie and Louis C.K. as Al, an amorous suitor who brings Ginger a few moments of romantic salvation. Allen's European sojourn appears to have freed him up with the movement of characters in scenes and Javier Aguirresarobe's (Vicky Cristina Barcelona) camerawork complies nicely. The San Francisco locations bring a nice geographic change to Allen's storytelling, and he only uses the Golden Gate Bridge in a long shot once from the Marin side. This is Allen's best work in quite a while, and Blanchett is the ideal muse for his tale.",5,"Woody's Sharply Rendered Update of ""Streetcar"" Anchored by Blanchett's Brilliant Blanche-Like Turn",1375488000,"08 3, 2013",2013,3686,"['want', 'see', 'year', 'master', 'class', 'screen', 'acting', 'need', 'watch', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'mesmerizing', 'performance', 'Jasmine', 'French', 'delusional', 'Park', 'Avenue', 'socialite', 'wife', 'Woody', 'Allen', '46th', 'directorial', 'effort', 'sly', 'bicoastal', 'update', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'classicA', 'Streetcar', 'Named', 'Desire', 'film', 'impeccably', 'dressed', 'character', 'hit', 'rock', 'bottom', 'financial', 'wizard', 'husband', 'arrested', 'assets', 'are', 'liquidated', 'throes', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'San', 'Francisco', 'moves', 'kind-hearted', 'sister', 'Ginger', 'who', 'modest', 'blue-collar', 'life', 'tiny', 'apartment', 'edge', 'Mission', 'South', 'Van', 'Ness', '14th', 'Street', 'be', 'exact', 'two', 'hyperactive', 'sons', 'can', 'tell', 'Jasmine', 'not', 'only', 'element', 'quite', 'judgmental', 'how', 'sister', 'life', 'turned', 'out', 'irony', 'Jasmine', 'patronizing', 'attitude', 'habitual', 'liar', 'who', 'so', 'angry', 'destitute', 'circumstances', 'frequently', 'herself', 'story', 'basic', 'outline', 'Streetcar', 'interesting', 'turns', 'instance', 'when', 'better', 'taking', 'computer', 'classes', 'while', 'working', 'receptionist', 'dental', 'office.Allen', 'crafted', 'film', 'clever', 'juxtaposition', 'current', 'past', 'events', 'jarring', 'first', 'Jasmine', 'precarious', 'mental', 'state', 'then', 'dramatic', 'arc', 'far', 'more', 'straightforward', 'chronology', 'could', 'have', 'allowed', 'writer', 'become', 'more', 'vociferous', 'dialogue', 'losing', 'wit', ""n't"", 'pull', 'punches', 'when', 'confrontations', 'characters', 'two', 'sisters', 'men', 'women', 'people', 'different', 'classes', 'Hostility', 'can', 'come', 'flammable', 'torrents', 'thinly', 'veiled', 'remarks', 'Allen', 'so', 'dexterously', 'tone', 'testament', 'sharp', 'ability', 'drawing', 'out', 'truth', 'actors', 'Blanchett', 'wonder', 'regard', 'something', 'intensely', 'fearless', 'approach', 'Unafraid', 'lose', 'audience', 'sympathy', 'character', 'innate', 'sadness', 'Jasmine', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'next', 'also', 'sharp', 'class-based', 'humor', 'Jasmine', 'struggles', 'one', 'highlight', 'hilariously', 'executed', 'scene', 'pizza', 'restaurant', 'where', 'confused', 'nephews', 'Tip', 'big', 'boys', '.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'manage', 'effective', 'turns', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Jasmine', 'swindler', 'husband', 'almost', 'effortless', 'aplomb', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'wonderful', 'looseness', 'Ginger', 'Stella', 'Blanchett', 'Blanche', 'level', 'poignancy', 'character', 'constant', 'victimization', 'hands', 'sister', 'as', 'well', 'brutish', 'blue-collar', 'boyfriend', 'Chili', 'played', 'comic', 'fierceness', 'Bobby', 'Cannavale', 'Stanley', 'Kowalski', 'role', 'conveniently', 'conceived', 'role', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'uncharacteristically', 'breezy', 'Dwight', 'wealthy', 'erudite', 'matrimonially', 'available', 'State', 'Department', 'diplomat', 'who', 'be', 'answer', 'Jasmine', 'prayers', 'Allen', 'two', 'unlikely', 'comics', 'about-face', 'roles', 'Andrew', 'Dice', 'Clay', 'Ginger', 'defeated', 'ex-husband', 'Augie', 'Louis', 'C.K', 'Al', 'amorous', 'suitor', 'who', 'Ginger', 'few', 'moments', 'romantic', 'salvation', 'Allen', 'European', 'sojourn', 'have', 'freed', 'up', 'movement', 'characters', 'scenes', 'Javier', 'Aguirresarobe', 'Vicky', 'Cristina', 'Barcelona', 'camerawork', 'complies', 'nicely', 'San', 'Francisco', 'locations', 'bring', 'nice', 'geographic', 'change', 'Allen', 'storytelling', 'only', 'Golden', 'Gate', 'Bridge', 'long', 'shot', 'once', 'Marin', 'side', 'Allen', 'best', 'work', 'quite', 'while', 'Blanchett', 'ideal', 'muse', 'tale']",Blue Jasmine

1657893,A2MEPR41IMURZA,B00DL47RQ2,Eric Hutchins,"[0, 3]","This is clearly one of Woody Allen's best films, and a case can be made that it is in fact his best. It is also among his very best acted films. If Cate Blanchett does not win an Oscar for her lead, it will be proof that acting doesn't count as much anymore as it should in Oscar picks.Cate plays a character that is not ordinarily the object of much empathy or compassion: the wife of a big-time, financial crook (played under Allen's direction with great credibility and balance by Alec Baldwin). Here however, you cannot help but feel every ounce of her pain as she struggles mightily to survive the ordeal of falling from having it all to being penniless by way of being spotted by a close friend selling shoes in a store where they once shopped together. Throughout, the nominally ""comedic relief"" does not provide relief at all. Under Allen's script and direction, it sharply intensifies this woman's relentless pain. ""Pain"" may indeed be too soft a word for the daily agony she endures from her past, her present circumstances, her choices all along the way, and from the men with whom she comes into contact. While her circumstances are her own, under Allen's script and direction, her intense shame is universally discomforting.Were this the substance of Allen's film, it might be viewed as merely a cautionary tale, encouraging women to better understand what exactly their husbands do for a living. However, there is much, much more going on. Sally Hawkins gives a performance that shows us the plight of another woman in the person of the adopted sister of Cate's character. She is with no particular gifts, tastes, or morals, yet she remains a sensitive and profoundly vulnerable individual, worthy of our compassion. I suspect that Allen uses her character to broaden the pathos from one individual woman to the gender as a whole. The main story revolves around Cate's character, but it becomes so intertwined with the story of Sally's that it appears to be about two very different women representing the foibles that lead to the bad choices of all women, and to their mistreatment by men.This viewer walked out of the film emotionally drained, wondering if this was one of the best dramas he had seen in decades, AND wondering whether it belonged in his collection of best dramas. It is a hard movie to watch for all the right reasons. The characters are tough and well drawn. The acting is superb to the point that you cease to believe you are watching a film (until one scene, when you realize that Cate should have a lock on the Best Actress Oscar).Do not take the kids to see this film, and do what you can to remember that a film of equal emotional weight could be made showing how men are just as vulnerable and just as devastated by their choices, and by their callous mistreatment by women. In the end, we are all made vulnerable by our attachments to the illusory pleasures of life, and we are all victimized by the failure of others to treat us with the same empathy, compassion, and generosity they want from us. Allen may not have packed all this into Blue Jasmine, but on the other hand, he very well may have.

""Varick""","[0, 1]","Amazing acting job by Cate Blanchett playing a stuck-up, weak minded, morally vapid, ubber materialistic, psycho mess of a human being.  This movie wasn't a Hollywood clap trap, cookie cutter story line where the character learns the error of her ways, and grows & matures to be a fine virtuous person.It just tells a great story of flawed humans (which we all are) in everyday situations and that often, as life proves again and again, there isn't a happy ending where everything works out just fine.  Which is pretty much a summation of Woody Allen's philosophy on life.  Although I'm not nearly the pessimist he is, and I believe we make our own happiness if we want to be happy (takes a lot of work), nonetheless, let's face it, real life rarely goes by way of movie plots.Kate Blanchett does a marvelous job (as she usually does) and is frighteningly and thoroughly convincing in her role (as are all the players), however, my one issue with the movie are some of the actual characters such as  Augie (Andrew Dice Clay), Ginger (Sally Hawkins),  Chili (Bobby Cannavale), &  Eddie (Max Casella).  Not the actors themselves mind you, nor their performances.  My questions is why do these four main characters act and sound like they are from New York/New Jersey area with their diction, accents, and mannerisms when this takes place in the Bay area of California???  Jasmine's character is the only one from New York, and it's because she moved there when she met her husband.  There is no reference (unless I missed it) that these characters are all originally from the Tri-State area and they are transplants themselves.So, it just seemed like these characters were taken from a different New York story based Woody Allen movie, and injected into Blue Jasmine, and it doesn't quite work.Other than that, I highly recommend this movie for great, fun, interesting, if not tragic characters and a good story line.",4,& 1/2,1396828800,"04 7, 2014",2014,1915,"['Amazing', 'acting', 'job', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'playing', 'stuck-up', 'weak', 'minded', 'morally', 'vapid', 'ubber', 'materialistic', 'psycho', 'mess', 'human', 'being', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'Hollywood', 'clap', 'trap', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'story', 'line', 'where', 'character', 'error', 'ways', 'be', 'fine', 'virtuous', 'person.It', 'just', 'great', 'story', 'flawed', 'humans', 'are', 'everyday', 'situations', 'often', 'life', 'again', 'again', ""n't"", 'happy', 'ending', 'where', 'everything', 'out', 'just', 'fine', 'Which', 'pretty', 'much', 'summation', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'philosophy', 'life', ""'m"", 'not', 'nearly', 'pessimist', 'believe', 'make', 'own', 'happiness', 'want', 'be', 'happy', 'lot', 'work', 'nonetheless', 'let', 'face', 'real', 'life', 'rarely', 'way', 'movie', 'plots.Kate', 'Blanchett', 'marvelous', 'job', 'usually', 'frighteningly', 'thoroughly', 'convincing', 'role', 'are', 'players', 'however', 'one', 'issue', 'movie', 'are', 'actual', 'characters', 'such', 'Augie', 'Andrew', 'Dice', 'Clay', 'Ginger', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'Chili', 'Bobby', 'Cannavale', 'Eddie', 'Max', 'Casella', 'Not', 'actors', 'mind', 'performances', 'questions', 'why', 'do', 'four', 'main', 'characters', 'act', 'sound', 'are', 'New', 'York/New', 'Jersey', 'area', 'diction', 'accents', 'mannerisms', 'when', 'place', 'Bay', 'area', 'California', 'Jasmine', 'character', 'only', 'one', 'New', 'York', 'moved', 'there', 'when', 'met', 'husband', 'reference', 'missed', 'characters', 'are', 'originally', 'Tri-State', 'area', 'are', 'transplants', 'themselves.So', 'just', 'seemed', 'characters', 'were', 'taken', 'different', 'New', 'York', 'story', 'based', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'movie', 'injected', 'Blue', 'Jasmine', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work.Other', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'great', 'fun', 'interesting', 'not', 'tragic', 'characters', 'good', 'story', 'line']",Blue Jasmine

It is both funny and sad; engrossing and intense; and charming, all at the same time.The story concerns the plight of Jasmine French, a rich socialite who precipitously has a change in her fortunes (no pun intended).  She moves from New York to San Francisco to live with her sister, and the rest of the story unfolds as she tries to rebuild her life, while simultaneously disturbing everyone else's life around her.  The movie shows the meaning of blissfully ignorant vanity and how one person's desires and needs can overwhelm both herself and others she comes into contact with.  At the end of the movie, you will find yourself trying to understand why Jasmine does what she does, but at the same time not being surprised by what happens.The supporting performances are just brilliant - who knew Andrew Dice Clay could be so brilliant???

1657909,A2BDZAU0Y4J6NB,B00DL47RQ2,F. S. L'hoir,"[2, 3]","Cate Blanchett gives a devastating performance as Jasmine in Woody Allen's latest production. Her nuanced portrayal of a woman whose life is in the process of disintegration is so convincing that we experience her inner turmoil sometimes merely through a glance, a glint in her eye, as in the disturbing scene in which she is presenting a self-serving justification of her life to her nephews, frightening them in the process.The story, told in flashbacks that reflect Jasmine's fragmentation of her life, moves between a rather seedy San Francisco and an elegant New York. A story for our troubled economic times, it pays homage to Tennessee Williams' &#34;Streetcar Named Desire&#34;, in that Allen presents a similar dynamic between two sisters, one, well brought up, who has ostensibly married 'well', and the other, of low self-esteem, who has made a series of marital or near-marital blunders. Like Williams' Blanche du Bois, Jasmine, who is paying an extended visit to her sister, considers the latter's boyfriend uncouth. Like Blanche, Jasmine, who seems to have developed a borderline personality, has erased all the sordid events of the past from her memory banks, although like a victim of post-traumatic stress, they have a way of intruding onto her consciousness when she least expects them. Like Blanche, she tries to start over with a plausibly respectable man; and like Blanche, her past impinges suddenly onto the present, shattering her hopes which have been built on a foundation of fantasy.See this film for Cate Blanchette's remarkable portrayal of a flawed woman who both fascinates and horrifies us, since, in these turbulent economic times, she could very will be someone we know, if not some version of ourselves.",5,Little Kindness from Strangers,1392508800,"02 16, 2014",2014,1738,"['Cate', 'Blanchett', 'devastating', 'performance', 'Jasmine', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'latest', 'production', 'nuanced', 'portrayal', 'woman', 'life', 'process', 'disintegration', 'so', 'convincing', 'experience', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'sometimes', 'merely', 'glance', 'glint', 'eye', 'disturbing', 'scene', 'presenting', 'self-serving', 'justification', 'life', 'nephews', 'frightening', 'process.The', 'story', 'told', 'flashbacks', 'reflect', 'Jasmine', 'fragmentation', 'life', 'moves', 'rather', 'seedy', 'San', 'Francisco', 'elegant', 'New', 'York', 'A', 'story', 'troubled', 'economic', 'times', 'homage', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', '34', 'Streetcar', 'Named', 'Desire', '34', 'Allen', 'similar', 'dynamic', 'two', 'sisters', 'one', 'well', 'brought', 'up', 'who', 'ostensibly', 'married', ""'well"", 'other', 'low', 'self-esteem', 'who', 'made', 'series', 'marital', 'near-marital', 'blunders', 'Williams', 'Blanche', 'du', 'Bois', 'Jasmine', 'who', 'paying', 'extended', 'visit', 'sister', 'latter', 'boyfriend', 'uncouth', 'Blanche', 'Jasmine', 'who', 'have', 'developed', 'borderline', 'personality', 'erased', 'sordid', 'events', 'past', 'memory', 'banks', 'victim', 'post-traumatic', 'stress', 'have', 'way', 'intruding', 'consciousness', 'when', 'least', 'Blanche', 'start', 'plausibly', 'respectable', 'man', 'Blanche', 'past', 'impinges', 'suddenly', 'present', 'shattering', 'hopes', 'have', 'been', 'built', 'foundation', 'fantasy.See', 'film', 'Cate', 'Blanchette', 'remarkable', 'portrayal', 'flawed', 'woman', 'who', 'fascinates', 'horrifies', 'turbulent', 'economic', 'times', 'could', 'very', 'will', 'be', 'someone', 'know', 'not', 'version', 'ourselves']",Blue Jasmine

1657913,A2BPDFR58H9575,B00DL47RQ2,Galina,"[4, 7]","All 45+ movies directed by Woody Allen start identically, first, with the black screen for few moments, and then white-on-black credits, placed with the perfect symmetry in the Windsor typeface, and set to jazz music. The empty black screen in the beginning is like Malevich's black square that can content anything behind it. Watching it for few seconds before the movie starts is for the Allen's fan the sweetest moment of anticipation the new work from the favorite filmmaker. Where will he take us this time? Following the fallen celestial being named Jasmine from the Mt. Olympus on Manhattan to the lowland of San Francisco Bay area, Woody Allen and Cate Blanchett have created the special treat for the movie lovers.I don't know what took Woody Allen and Cate Blanchett so long but finally the match that was meant to be blessed by the movie gods took place and produced one of the strongest ever Woody Allen's dramatic films with what could be the best single performance in his movie, and that tells a lot.Woody Allen and Cate Blanchet use the familiar setting of the great classical American play by Tennessee Williams ""The street car named desire"" but re-invented it by moving plot to the modern days of the post 2008 financial crisis and the collapse of the largest Ponzi scheme in the history of the USA. The film takes place in San Francisco and in flashbacks goes to the posh Manhattan apartment, trendy restaurants, five stars hotels, and Hamptons summer house where Blanchett's character, Jasmine Francis used to lead the life of the elegant socialite, the wife of the Wall Street financial wizard, Hal (Alec Baldwin effortlessly effective as a smooth-talking charming silver-tongued rascal who made his fortune by ruining millions of people with his ruthless machinations). ""Blue Jasmine"" is announced as a comedy but it is a very dark comedy or rather tragicomedy and it concerns two very different sisters, Jasmine (Blanchett) and Ginger (Sally Hawkins. Both adapted as the babies, Jasmine (one with the good genes) was determined, beautiful, smart, went to college, found a very rich husband and moved to the higher social step. Kind and simple Ginger had a construction worker husband, two children, a menial job, and one chance to make a better life for her family when she and her husband Augie won a lottery and made the trip to New York City to celebrate with Jasmine and Hal and to ask Hal about the best investment of 200K lottery money. Needless to say that after having invested in one of the Hal's schemes, Ginger and Augie never saw a penny of their money. Andrew Dice Clay, famous as a stand-up comedian, gave a moving performance as Augie which is not surprising at all. Looks like simply being in Allen's movie brings forward everything an actor is capable of. Blue Jasmine is not exception, and every actor gives memorable performance even in the small roles. Sally Hawkins as Ginger is admirable. Ginger's live has never been easy or glamorous but she accepts whatever good it has to offer, she does not expect much and she is able to keep her sanity, reason, and good spirits which can't be said about Jasmine.When Jasmine's life collapses along with the fall of her husband's financial empire, she loses everything including her grip to reality and is forced to turn to very person she never thought of while being on top of the world, her sister Ginger. Moving from NYC to SF, staying with her sister in a small ""homey"" apartment and trying to do something with herself, to move on with her life, to make sense of it, Jasmine in Blanchett's performance is a complex multifaceted and hard to forget person. She is selfish, delusional, weak, depressed, classy, charming, scared, confused, and feverish. She is visibly suffocating living the life she knows nothing about and she does not want to know about. She is ashamed of herself, of what she became, of how low she has fallen, while she believes that she is entitled to the finest things in life. There is obvious guilt she carries with her. She is truly a fish out of water. She tries to adjust to the real world but she has no skills for survival in it on her own. With one gesture, one look, one change of facial expression, Blanchet takes Jasmine from hopes to turmoil to despair, from glitz and glamour of the recent past to the uncertainty and fear of present, and watching her impetuous sudden transformations is heartbreaking. I've been Cate Blanchett's fan for many years and I treasure every role I've seen her in but in Woody Allen's ""Blue Jasmine"" she is more than superb or excellent. She is beyond any superlatives. There is no single false note in her performance. I did not want to feel sorry or sympathize with Jasmine. Comparing to Blanche Dubois with whom a lot of critics and viewers identify her, Jasmine was guilty of at least an act of deliberate cruelty which is unforgivable, and she knew it. But, differently from Blanche, by the time the movie starts, Jasmine is not on the verge but beyond a nervous breakdown and watching her trying to deal with it, helping herself with vodka martinis and Xanax while having delusions of superiority and fading hope of somehow be able to move on, to pull herself through, and bursting in the sudden agitated talking to herself on the streets, on the park benches, on the plain sit, makes a viewer to feel for her against their best instincts. You simply can't take your eyes off her for a second. This is a master class in acting, authenticity, and humanity by Cate Blanchett, the most talented actor (of both genders) of her generation in the best serious film by Woody Allen.""Blue Jasmine"" is a beautiful movie to look at. San Francisco and NYC, two cities-antipodes look marvelous under the Javier Aguirresarobe's camera but the best visual treats come from seamless flashbacks that added so much to the story of paradise (with plenty of snakes lurking ) lost. Whatever flaws the film might have, like using some characters or their convenient appearances in the right time in the right places as merely plot devices, don't matter much in presence of greatness whose name is Cate Blanchett.But let's imagine for a second that the movie was as much about one woman's loss of her fairy tale life and about class differences in the modern society as it was about some of Woody Allen's own life experiences: his memory of being in the eye of public disgrace and scandal, his own son's refusal to have anything to do with his father, and his perception of the greatest disaster of all - being shut off from the only thing in life that matters to him, which is making movies. In that case, Allen's gave the face to his own nightmares, disasters, and regrets, and that is Jasmine's face in the final scene of his latest, dark and great film.4.5/5 or 9/10",4,Jasmine's blues and

And then there are the treasures such as `Interiors' and this incredibly well written tale of 21st century class differences, family disparities, greed, and substance abuse as well as people abuse. The primary reason for seeing this film is the joy of watch Cate Blanchett's indelible performance of a woman wholly out of control without the support of money, a man, pills, and alcohol. She is astonishingly fine.Jasmine French (Cate Blanchett) had been on the top of the success mountain as a New York socialite, until her marriage to philandering and criminally inclined Hal (Alec Baldwin) ended when in a snit of hostility she turns him into the FBI for his fraudulent career in money investment and ends up hanging himself wile in prison. Jasmine lost all of her valuables and money when Hal was discovered and now is penniless, jobless (and `above' taking a routine job) so she returns to her estranged sister Ginger (Sally Hawkins) in San Francisco utterly ruined. As Jasmine struggles with her haunting memories of a privileged past bearing dark realities she ignored, she tries to recover in her present: pills, alcohol, a receptionist job in a dentist's office (the dentist comes on to her), her `above all this squalor' treatment of Ginger, Ginger's boyfriend Chili (Bobby Cannavale) and children, and her missteps in lying to a wealthy suitor (Peter Sarsgaard) all turn out wrong. Jasmine's inability to function as a `normal' woman unprotected by the facade of `upper class nobility' result in her making her own existence untenable to her and to everyone she encounters.Allen wisely tells his story in rapid flip-flops between Jasmine's past in New York and her present in San Francisco. The cast is homogeneously excellent, down to the smallest part. But in the end this is a triumph in acting for Cate Blanchett and she simply outdoes her past roles with a dazzling brilliance.

It has drama (Out of the Furnace, Blue is the warmest color, Great Gatsby, Place Beyond Pines) and had some action (Captain Phillips) and a lot of independent dramas but what was sorely missing from this equation was a comedy. So lets begin , shall we?If there was an award for fascinating screenplay, this film must get the nod because it is amusing how quickly it becomes a part of your living room. I have seen Cate Blanchett in a number of performances but none more succinct and apt than this one right here. She plays the kind of person who always feels that the world has CHEATED her out of her best years. She is so sad, it  is really funny to see her being clumsy. There are scenes where her character Jasmine (of course) is constantly being tortured about what she is going to learn at medical school. She enjoys attention but hates attention. She plays the role of the aggrieved party to perfection. JUST WHY IS BLUE JASMINE SUCH A FUNNY FILM? Because Woody Allen knows us humans so well and when I see characters on scene do things I would do in real life but never admit to myself, I find it thoroughly entertaining and intriguing.+ Strong plot (Such a strong plot related with effortless charms makes Blue Jasmine very REWATCHABLE)+ Great use of celebrities and Stand ups (The casting was amazing. I didn't know Andrew Dice Clay could help himself but Woody Allen uses this annoying Celebrity to near perfection)+ Locales/Situations/Terrific Editing+ Humor - Blue Jasmine is blessed with timing and the delightful gift of playing on people&#8217;s sentiments, both happy and sad.Overall, this film is as good as they get.

It even lacks his Schadenfreude, which has sometimes spoiled his films for me. It combines elements of classic Tennessee Williams melodrama with recent financial news.

Can that be a coincidence?Cate Blanchett's Jasmine was the wife of a late big time financial crook in New York. We learn her story in flashbacks. When her husband (Alec Baldwin) shipwrecks, she is lost in a maelstrom of shame, ruin, and confusion. She crosses the continent to stay with her red neck sister in San Francisco. She can't adjust her pretensions and illusions to the new realities. She talks, often to herself, often to mere strangers.

She has flown west to live with her estranged sister Ginger with the other threads of her Park Avenue wardrobe in her Louis Vuitton luggage. Her philandering swindler husband has been jailed in New York. Cate Blanchett is playing Jasmine brilliantly with aplomb...a character in a permanent fog of Xanax and vodka.We meet Jasmine at the San Francisco airport...muttering to an elderly woman she meets in first class. We follow her to her sister's tacky apartment in San Francisco's Mission blue-collar neighborhood. We watch her reactions to her sister, her sister's two sons, and the tough-guy boyfriend. It's not a life she has been accustomed to living.BLUE JASMINE is not, as a few reviewers declare, a rehash of Tennessee Williams's STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE...nor the imagined life of one real-life Ruth Madoff, the wife of disgraced swindler Bernie Madoff. And it's not a ""moral fable of greed and comeuppance."" It's a tale of comedown not comeuppance...too much pride in material possessions...a story of a lonely woman who has lost almost all of her worldly possessions, who tries to cope with circumstance, who musters enough charm to almost nab a younger and wealthy man-about-town; a woman who wanders through a few more weeks of life without luxury.Accompanying Cate Blanchett's brilliant turn as Jasmine is a well-selected supporting cast. The sister Ginger (Sally Hawkins) is a spunky young gal, divorced with two sons, who works as cashier and stock clerk in a small grocery; her differing looks are explained as genetics... both Ginger and Jasmine are adopted. Ginger's boy friend Chili (Bobby Cannavale) looks like George Peppard's punk son with tattoos and dark hair. The swindler husband is played straight by a handsome and svelte Alec Baldwin. Andrew Dice Clay cleans up his act to become Ginger's ex-husband Augie.Director Woody Allen, not a personal favorite of mine until lately, has tried to tell us about downward spirals of life. He has his main character mutter about what was, what could have been, and what is now.

It focuses between the new harsh reality and the past that was so full of possibilities.  Life can be a great equalizer and many people have experienced hard times even through no fault of their own.  I found myself sadly identifying with the main character Jasmine even though I've never been a socialite or had great wealth.  But it's easy to keep looking back into the past and comparing the circumstances we find ourselves living in to how they were different in the past.  It's easier when things keep getting better but how do we handle it when things are tougher and our earning power has greatly diminished leaving us with fewer choices or what do we do when our marriages fail?  Woody Allen takes a life changed by shattered promises with details that leave us shell shocked and ashamed at how it all played out in the public forum.As usual there is the great jazz movie soundtrack.  Cate Blanchett clearly here has been given an amazing role by Woody (one of his most memorable- and that's saying alot!)  I am so glad I bought this movie as I'll want to see it many times.  I now have two favorite Woody Allen movies... Hannah and Her Sisters and Blue Jasmine. This movie has a well chosen cast with Alec Baldwin, Andrew Dice Clay and Sally Hawkins as standouts.  Alec is great as the cheating husband and Sally as the sister who has a big heart and unfortunately has too ordinary a life for Jasmine to have paid her any attention until all her luck has run out!  You get the distinct impression that living with her sister is the absolute lowest point in her life and if she had any other option she would have not stooped so low! It is totally lost on Jasmine that she should actually be grateful for her sister's generosity and it is keeping her from being out on the street.  Ginger, the sister is a more contented person and not consumed by her possessions.People have mentioned that her sister apartment is tacky but I think it's about as cozy as an average home of a working class person.  I think that Woody Allen has imparted keen awareness of how easily life can shatter when people build their lives on lies.  I, also, think that had Jasmine's husband not been so lavishly supporting Jasmine's needs of stoking her self centered life style she wouldn't have had the liberty of wearing blinders where it came to her husband's activities.  It also occurred to me that Woody Allen having gone through his scandal of the fall out over his affair with his step daughter a decade ago gave him keen insight into writing an insightful script about a shattered life from scandal, the aftermath and how it could break a person into little pieces.  I'm glad that Mr. Allen didn't let his life or talent break apart but used it as a catalyst for creativity.",5,This is Woody Allen & Cate Blanchett at their Respective Bests,1390435200,"01 23, 2014",2014,2857,"['such', 'nuanced', 'story', 'fragile', 'personality', 'broken', 'too', 'many', 'knock', 'out', 'blows', 'new', 'harsh', 'reality', 'past', 'was', 'so', 'full', 'possibilities', 'Life', 'can', 'be', 'great', 'equalizer', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'experienced', 'hard', 'times', 'even', 'fault', 'own', 'found', 'sadly', 'identifying', 'main', 'character', 'Jasmine', 'even', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'socialite', 'had', 'great', 'wealth', 'easy', 'keep', 'looking', 'back', 'past', 'comparing', 'circumstances', 'find', 'living', 'how', 'were', 'different', 'past', 'easier', 'when', 'things', 'keep', 'getting', 'better', 'how', 'do', 'handle', 'when', 'things', 'are', 'tougher', 'earning', 'power', 'greatly', 'diminished', 'leaving', 'fewer', 'choices', 'what', 'do', 'do', 'when', 'marriages', 'fail', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'life', 'changed', 'shattered', 'promises', 'details', 'leave', 'shell', 'shocked', 'ashamed', 'how', 'played', 'out', 'public', 'forum.As', 'usual', 'great', 'jazz', 'movie', 'soundtrack', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'clearly', 'here', 'been', 'given', 'amazing', 'role', 'Woody', 'one', 'most', 'memorable-', 'saying', 'alot', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'bought', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'want', 'see', 'many', 'times', 'now', 'have', 'two', 'favorite', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'movies', 'Hannah', 'Her', 'Sisters', 'Blue', 'Jasmine', 'movie', 'well', 'chosen', 'cast', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Andrew', 'Dice', 'Clay', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'standouts', 'Alec', 'great', 'cheating', 'husband', 'Sally', 'sister', 'who', 'big', 'heart', 'unfortunately', 'too', 'ordinary', 'life', 'Jasmine', 'have', 'paid', 'attention', 'luck', 'run', 'out', 'get', 'distinct', 'impression', 'living', 'sister', 'absolute', 'lowest', 'point', 'life', 'had', 'other', 'option', 'would', 'have', 'not', 'stooped', 'so', 'low', 'totally', 'lost', 'Jasmine', 'should', 'actually', 'be', 'grateful', 'sister', 'generosity', 'keeping', 'being', 'out', 'street', 'Ginger', 'sister', 'more', 'contented', 'person', 'not', 'consumed', 'possessions.People', 'have', 'mentioned', 'sister', 'apartment', 'tacky', 'think', 'as', 'cozy', 'average', 'home', 'working', 'class', 'person', 'think', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'imparted', 'keen', 'awareness', 'how', 'easily', 'life', 'can', 'shatter', 'when', 'people', 'build', 'lives', 'lies', 'also', 'think', 'had', 'Jasmine', 'husband', 'not', 'been', 'so', 'lavishly', 'supporting', 'Jasmine', 'needs', 'stoking', 'self', 'centered', 'life', 'style', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'had', 'liberty', 'wearing', 'blinders', 'where', 'came', 'husband', 'activities', 'also', 'occurred', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'having', 'gone', 'scandal', 'fall', 'out', 'affair', 'step', 'daughter', 'decade', 'ago', 'gave', 'keen', 'insight', 'writing', 'insightful', 'script', 'shattered', 'life', 'scandal', 'aftermath', 'how', 'could', 'break', 'person', 'little', 'pieces', ""'m"", 'glad', 'Mr.', 'Allen', 'did', ""n't"", 'let', 'life', 'talent', 'break', 'apart', 'used', 'catalyst', 'creativity']",Blue Jasmine

Is that a long time or really quite a while between making great films?What a nice problem to have, contributing such an impressive body of work that there is no one to top but yourself.  I, for one, take high expectations a Woody Allen title but he usually meets or exceeds them.  Except for TO ROME WITH LOVE, with which I have yet to catch up, the last of his films I did not like enough to view more than once was CASSANDRA'S DREAM, from 2007.  I will see BLUE JASMINE a second time, maybe a third.Cate Blanchett was only in one film I knew, an Indiana Jones flick, before starring in BLUE JASMINE.  I don't remember her in the Jones movie but won't forget her in this one.  If Blanchett does not get an Oscar nomination, then Meryl Streep will have to have had all the other female lead roles in 2013.  It would not surprise me to see supporting cast members Andrew Dice Clay and Bobby Cannavale receive acting nominations, too.Oh, so what's BLUE JASMINE about?

It's easy to turn in a good performance when you are given a good script, but she managed to do so with this mess.As a resident of San Francisco, I have to wonder if Woody Allen spent even a day here before working on this script. The town is ripe for satire, from the self-absorbed techies wearing Google Glasses and piling on and off of the monstrous buses that are clogging the streets in the Mission, to the oh-so-precious restaurants and food trucks that combine ingredients that God purposefully put on opposite ends of the earth to keep apart. Instead, what we get is a bunch of New Jersey mooks&#8212;possibly the only kind of person you will never run into in the San Francisco. He might as well have set it in Asbury Park. The whole thing would have made more sense there.Then there is the inescapable feeling that this story was intended as a swipe at Mia Farrow. I'm sure Mr. Allen will deny it, but it sure seems like one to this disinterested bystander. I usually enjoy Woody Allen's films and I was looking forward to his take on life in SF, but what we got was this weird personal vendetta instead.

I'm admirer of her as an actress which is why I watched the film.  I don't want to go into the plot in depth as you can read that in many places.  In short, she was the wife of a Wall Street con man (a Bernie Madoff or Wolf of Wall Street type, perfectly cast with Alec Baldwin) and when his Ponzi scheme comes crashing down she loses everything, but really can't accept it.  She flies from New York City to San Francisco to &#34;temporarily&#34; stay with her sister Ginger (they're supposed to have been adopted, so they aren't biological sibs) who has never lived the life of luxury that Jasmine did.  Ginger's been married and divorced once (I didn't recognize that was Andrew Dice Clay as her ex-husband) and struggles to support herself and her 2 boys working at a grocery store.  Recently she's gotten engaged to a man &#34;Chili&#34; who, though also of modest means, she thinks will make a loyal and hard-working husband for her and decent father-figure to her boys.Jasmine, obviously alcoholic and also on psychiatric medications, cannot imagine ever stooping so low herself as to clerk at a grocery store, but also obviously hasn't held a job of significance her entire life.  She seems to feel somehow she just DESERVES to have a nice life, even if not quite as luxurious as what she had before.  She's also constantly telling Ginger that she shouldn't &#34;settle&#34; for a man like Chili (even in front of him, while he tries to bite his tongue).Things seem to possibly turn brighter for both sisters when they go to a party.  An obviously wealthy man is very attracted to Jasmine, hires her to decorate a house he just bought in Marin, and soon asks her to marry him.  Ginger also meets a guy with an income one step above &#34;Chili&#34; who seems passionately attracted to her.As the old saying goes, things that seem too good to be true usually are.  Ginger, basically with no unrealistic expectations for her life, clearly will bounce back, but at the end of the movie Jasmine looks like she's headed back to a psychiatric ward again (if not off the Golden Gate Bridge)...Blanchett at the Academy Awards made mention of the makeup people who &#34;tried to make me look pretty every day&#34;.  Actually it was more like the opposite.  Most days it seemed they had to make her look a lot LESS pretty than she actually is.  [The movie cuts back and forth between her days of wealth in NYC and hard times in SF so it's true, she looks great in NYC, but in San Francisco it's more about giving her the pink-eyed look and disheveled hair of someone with a hangover].When she thanked Woody Allen for picking her for the part in his movie there was only light applause.  Allen's career began with brilliantly funny films, then went through his dark period in which he tried to make serious character studies that were some of the most depressing I've ever seen (or seen PARTS of!), then briefly back to comedy, then settled into....THIS.  Ever since moving to France, it seems to me rather like Oscar Wilde after fleeing England, he doesn't seem to have produced anything with the brilliance of his early career.  The same themes are still there, but much more subdued, almost the ghosts of old laughs and sorrows.  If the ghost of Woody Allen past is enough for you, then you will enjoy this.",3,Nothing Earth Shattering,1393804800,"03 3, 2014",2014,3384,"['Well', 'note', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'won', 'best', 'actress', 'film', 'actually', '3', 'awards', ""'m"", 'admirer', 'actress', 'why', 'watched', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'plot', 'depth', 'can', 'read', 'many', 'places', 'short', 'was', 'wife', 'Wall', 'Street', 'con', 'man', 'Bernie', 'Madoff', 'Wolf', 'Wall', 'Street', 'type', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'when', 'Ponzi', 'scheme', 'crashing', 'down', 'everything', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'accept', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'San', 'Francisco', '34', 'temporarily', '34', 'stay', 'sister', 'Ginger', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'have', 'been', 'adopted', 'are', ""n't"", 'biological', 'sibs', 'who', 'never', 'lived', 'life', 'luxury', 'Jasmine', 'did', 'Ginger', 'been', 'married', 'divorced', 'once', 'did', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'was', 'Andrew', 'Dice', 'Clay', 'ex-husband', 'support', '2', 'boys', 'working', 'grocery', 'store', 'Recently', 'gotten', 'engaged', 'man', '34', 'Chili', '34', 'who', 'also', 'modest', 'means', 'will', 'make', 'loyal', 'hard-working', 'husband', 'decent', 'father-figure', 'boys.Jasmine', 'obviously', 'alcoholic', 'also', 'psychiatric', 'medications', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'ever', 'stooping', 'so', 'low', 'clerk', 'grocery', 'store', 'also', 'obviously', ""n't"", 'held', 'job', 'significance', 'entire', 'life', 'feel', 'somehow', 'just', 'DESERVES', 'have', 'nice', 'life', 'even', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'luxurious', 'what', 'had', 'also', 'constantly', 'telling', 'Ginger', 'should', ""n't"", '34', 'settle', '34', 'man', 'Chili', 'even', 'front', 'bite', 'tongue', 'seem', 'possibly', 'turn', 'brighter', 'sisters', 'when', 'go', 'party', 'obviously', 'wealthy', 'man', 'very', 'attracted', 'Jasmine', 'decorate', 'house', 'just', 'bought', 'Marin', 'soon', 'marry', 'Ginger', 'also', 'guy', 'income', 'one', 'step', '34', 'Chili', '34', 'who', 'passionately', 'attracted', 'her.As', 'old', 'saying', 'things', 'seem', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'true', 'usually', 'are', 'Ginger', 'basically', 'unrealistic', 'expectations', 'life', 'clearly', 'will', 'bounce', 'back', 'end', 'movie', 'Jasmine', 'headed', 'back', 'psychiatric', 'ward', 'again', 'not', 'Golden', 'Gate', 'Bridge', 'Blanchett', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'made', 'mention', 'makeup', 'people', 'who', '34', 'tried', 'make', 'look', 'pretty', 'day', '34', 'was', 'more', 'opposite', 'Most', 'days', 'seemed', 'had', 'make', 'look', 'lot', 'LESS', 'pretty', 'actually', '[', 'movie', 'back', 'forth', 'days', 'wealth', 'NYC', 'hard', 'times', 'SF', 'true', 'great', 'NYC', 'San', 'Francisco', 'more', 'giving', 'pink-eyed', 'look', 'disheveled', 'hair', 'someone', 'hangover', ']', '.When', 'thanked', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'picking', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'only', 'light', 'applause', 'Allen', 'career', 'began', 'brilliantly', 'funny', 'films', 'then', 'went', 'dark', 'period', 'tried', 'make', 'serious', 'character', 'studies', 'were', 'most', 'depressing', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'seen', 'PARTS', 'then', 'briefly', 'back', 'comedy', 'then', 'settled', '.THIS', 'Ever', 'moving', 'France', 'rather', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'fleeing', 'England', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'produced', 'anything', 'brilliance', 'early', 'career', 'same', 'themes', 'are', 'still', 'there', 'much', 'more', 'subdued', 'almost', 'ghosts', 'old', 'laughs', 'sorrows', 'ghost', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'past', 'enough', 'then', 'will', 'enjoy']",Blue Jasmine
1657998,A1RN5Q2NPT6ISB,B00DL47RQ2,"Kate Smart ""Private""","[11, 16]","This is perhaps Woody Allen's darkest film, but that does not explain my disappointment. For starters, Woody Allen's bouncy 1930's and 40's jazz track that seems to accompany the majority of his films is so jarringly misplaced in this movie that it becomes a distraction. That was the first thing that bothered me. The second glaring mistake was his choice of location: It's San Francisco but every single character featured is decidedly New York - from accents and mannerisms to turns of phrase and expressions. These two things may seem insignificant but they weren't to me - it created a dissonance that could have been appreciated had it been clearly deliberate. I don't believe it was. Perhaps Woody Allen is too close to his work and is repeating himself; he should call in outside (younger) opinion and thereby avoid such oversights.To say that Blanchett's performance is good is an understatement; you cannot take your eyes off of her. But that isn't enough to save this film. Every single supporting character is loathsome to one extent or another. Even Peter Saarsgard's character - a supposedly decent guy - seems creepy and suspicious, although that was clearly not Allen's intention. Sally Hawkin's relentlessly ditzy shaky-voiced persona became nearly unwatchable; her boyfriend is a cartoon-like buffoon - a complete stereotype that we've seen so often that it's boring. Louis CK's presence in the film is bewildering. It made absolutely no sense whatsoever; his entire role should have been deleted on the cutting room floor.  I could go on and on. One-dimensional characters who experience no growth, who remain stagnant throughout the whole movie, are just not interesting.Woody Allen is an old man and it's truly commendable that he's still writing, producing, and directing his own films. But placing a movie in modern times with a scratchy jazz soundtrack shows that he's behind the times. Writing a female character who has absolutely no understanding of computers is behind the times. Even the most useless of rich socialites uses a computer if only to shop on-line. That such a woman could obtain employment in a dental office without any computer skills is absurd; every medical office is automated and computerized. His female characters are a throw-back to another era; they just don't ring true at all. Sally Hawkin's character has two kids we rarely see; we meet her ex-husband in flashbacks but he has no presence in the lives of his kids - it's only when he bumps into Jasmine on the street that we remember him at all. This was odd to me; when the kids are absent are we to assume they're with their father?

Gordon,"[5, 7]","Whatever the strengths and weaknesses of Allen's yearly offerings, you have to admire a man thatis in his 70s, has made 44 movies, and yet seems to keep trying to stretch his wings, and style,while still retaining a very recognizable film-making technique. Allen's films are always clearlyhis, yet the tone, feel and structure of the films almost always has something a little new. Inthis case, Allen is going for straight drama, (yes there are a few amusing moments, but in generalthis is pretty serious stuff) something he hasn't done since ""Match Point"". But ""Match Point"" alsohad the structure of being a mystery/thriller, whereas ""Blue Jasmine"" is a character study, pureand simple. And in that it's not quite like anything Allen has done in his many, many films. Theearlier dramas like ""Interiors"" or ""Another Woman"" were both more stylized and weren't reallyabout dissecting a single fatally flawed character as if under a microscope.This grew on me on a second viewing. Some of my problems remained; a lot of the supporting charactersare stereotypes, in spite of being played by wonderful actors, doing all they can to bring them life. Butthe great Cate Blanchett, who seems incapable of being less than amazing, somehow manages to bringreality, humanity and sometimes even pathos to this self-involved borderline crazy and theatrical messof a human being.Whatever the quibbles, this is intelligent, grown up film-making, trying to grapple with big questions ofmorality and personal responsibility, and unafraid of being a study of a largely unlikable woman.

1658022,A1OZAYRJQAERTK,B00DL47RQ2,Larry Benjamin,"[2, 3]","Although several of his recent films have taken place outside New York City (&#34;Vicky Christina Barcelona,&#34; &#34;Midnight in Paris,&#34; &#34;To Rome With Love&#34;), most of Allen's oeuvre has centered on the activities of wealthy, educated, successful New Yorkers. Like Jane Austen's relationship with her own subject matter, Allen focused on the stories of the kind of people he knew best. In every case, wealth and privilege are taken for granted. The closest he came to the fragility of social position was in &#34;Crimes and Misdemeanors,&#34; which concerned a protagonist at risk of losing everything as a result of an impulsive romantic entanglement. &#34;Blue Jasmine&#34; is different in that this fragility is made real; the protagonist does in fact lose everything.Told in a series of flashbacks, I was initally confused by the film's first few minutes - it appeared as if the main character, after arriving broke at her sister's in San Francisco, was suddenly rich again and throwing dinner parties. Once the main features of the scenes taking place in the past were apparent (New York setting, Alec Baldwin's presence, lots of money), it was easy to tell them apart - easier for the audience than Cate Blanchett's character sometimes.The film may be unappealing to some as the characters are without exception shallow, stupid, or dishonest - or all three. Allen scrupulously avoids portraying the working-class characters as sympathetic or admirable - these include violent, drunken crybabies, shiftless losers, shameless liars, and vindictive kvetches. As the central character, Jasmine is shown to be disloyal, superficial, and when she had power and money, uninterested in using it to build anything of enduring value. And yet we cannot take pleasure in her final downfall (actually several downfalls). Maybe the film's final lesson is to not feel so superior to the filthy homeless person babbling to himself.My main criticism of the film is its weakness of location. Allen has if nothing else always strongly communicated the feeling of whatever city his story took place in, but the San Francisco of &#34;Blue Jasmine&#34; almost seems an afterthought. Other than a few shots of Lombard Street and the Golden Gate Bridge, the film could have been anywhere. Indeed, a more bland setting, like the Inland Empire or Council Bluffs, Iowa, might have better communicated the atmosphere of disappointment and downward spiral that the film was trying to convey. San Francisco is too much fun, too young, high-tech, and vibrant for such thoughts, although maybe Allen intended for there to be a contrast. At one point, a character says &#34;if you can't find love in San Francisco, you can't find it anywhere.&#34; Unfortunately, she's right.Not an easy film to watch, and lacking anything even approaching a satisfying resolution, nevertheless &#34;Blue Jasmine&#34; is valuable as a counterweight to Allen's obsession with what could be characterized as first-world problems.

A key dilemma is how much does someone know, what does she do with what she knows, and what consequences result. The writer-director has created a cast of divergent believable characters who are, above all, interesting. Each character has flaws and good elements. The movies makes excellent use of flashbacks, a technique that often is difficult to implement. Here, the flashbacks work as they drive divergent story lines and helps us appreciate the future and flashback stories much better. While writer-director Woody Allen is known primarily for comedies, this is a serious drama. Do not arrive expecting a typical Woody Allen comedy. One should find a sensitive look into the lives of people with their own torments and hopes. The acting is superb. As one who has liked Woody Allen's films yet criticized that sometimes needs someone overseeing his own work to help him trim some lines (which is a danger of writing and directing your own film), I have no such criticism for this film.  The screenplay is brilliant and the directing appears superb. Most characters arrive at satisfying arcs, although some may quibble that while Jasmine reaches an arc in her story line, one does not know what the future holds for Jasmine. Although, that probably is the point.

Power ""nlp trainer""","[133, 147]","I bought a ticket to this movie knowing absolutely nothing about it, and almost immediately as it began I knew I was watching a Woody Allen movie.I cannot say exactly why this is so.  Perhaps it was the richness of the character study, and the fact that Allen writes so excellently for female characters.  In any event, Cate Blanchett's character, and her brilliant performance of this down on her luck former socialite married to a conman husband played by Alec Baldwin, may be the best female character performance you will see on a movie screen this year, and Blanchett's performance is probably the most Oscar worthy I have seen so far.Set in San Francisco in the present day it unfolds the complex relationship of two sisters, one upper class but fallen on hard times, and her working class sister who makes working class choices.  Because it unfolds in a non linear fashion it appears to dip randomly into different events over a period of about 15 years or so, and we understand why the sister is working class.One of the themes of the movie is honesty, and facing reality, and Jasmine makes choices that seem oblivious to it. She fibs and tells little lies, at one level self deceptive, and at another deceptive of others.  We may not like her for this, but if you're like me, I felt tremendous compassion for her, even loved her in spite of everything, which is not often I feel that way about a character.  She suffers from severe anxiety, and the events she has to undergo take a toll on her.  One particular choice she makes has particularly severe repercussions, yet in the moment we fully understand it.I think it is fair to say moving to Europe and making films there has been wonderful for Woody Allen.  In an interview he said that his previous movies were critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful. Now he has made a series of outstanding movies, and written brilliant roles particularly for women.I cannot claim to love all of them, butVicky Cristina Barcelonawas excellent and Penelope Cruz won an Oscar for her performance.Match Pointis probably my personal favorite starring Scarlet Johansson and Jonathan Rhys Meyers, about an upwardly mobile ambitious tennis coach, and what may be a perfect murder.Midnight in Pariswas dreamy and sentimental, and won an Oscar for best screenplay.  Woody Allen has been nominated a staggering 23 times for an Academy Award winning four times, three times for Best Original Screenplay, and once for Best Director of Annie Hall.Actors who worked with him have also won Oscars.  Remember Mira Sorvino for Mighty Aphrodite, and Michael Caine for Hannah and Sisters.As someone who lives in San Francisco, I can say that he makes it look almost better than the reality, and a beige BMW can do wonders to enliven the surroundings.It seems to me that like a good wine, Woody just gets better with age, and easily maintains his excellence with this movie.I think  most people will enjoy this movie, and I hope this was helpful.",5,One of Woody's best,1380931200,"10 5, 2013",2013,2985,"['bought', 'ticket', 'movie', 'knowing', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'almost', 'immediately', 'began', 'knew', 'was', 'watching', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'movie.I', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'exactly', 'why', 'so', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'richness', 'character', 'study', 'fact', 'Allen', 'so', 'excellently', 'female', 'characters', 'event', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'character', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'down', 'luck', 'former', 'socialite', 'married', 'conman', 'husband', 'played', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'female', 'character', 'performance', 'will', 'see', 'movie', 'screen', 'year', 'Blanchett', 'performance', 'probably', 'most', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'have', 'seen', 'so', 'far.Set', 'San', 'Francisco', 'present', 'day', 'complex', 'relationship', 'two', 'sisters', 'one', 'upper', 'class', 'fallen', 'hard', 'times', 'working', 'class', 'sister', 'who', 'working', 'class', 'choices', 'non', 'linear', 'fashion', 'dip', 'randomly', 'different', 'events', 'period', '15', 'years', 'so', 'understand', 'why', 'sister', 'working', 'class.One', 'themes', 'movie', 'honesty', 'facing', 'reality', 'Jasmine', 'choices', 'seem', 'oblivious', 'fibs', 'tells', 'little', 'lies', 'one', 'level', 'deceptive', 'deceptive', 'others', 'may', 'not', 'like', ""'re"", 'felt', 'tremendous', 'compassion', 'even', 'loved', 'spite', 'everything', 'not', 'often', 'feel', 'way', 'character', 'severe', 'anxiety', 'events', 'undergo', 'take', 'toll', 'One', 'particular', 'choice', 'particularly', 'severe', 'repercussions', 'yet', 'moment', 'fully', 'understand', 'it.I', 'think', 'fair', 'say', 'moving', 'Europe', 'making', 'films', 'there', 'been', 'wonderful', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'interview', 'said', 'previous', 'movies', 'were', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'commercially', 'unsuccessful', 'Now', 'made', 'series', 'outstanding', 'movies', 'written', 'brilliant', 'roles', 'particularly', 'women.I', 'can', 'not', 'claim', 'love', 'butVicky', 'Cristina', 'Barcelonawas', 'excellent', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'won', 'Oscar', 'performance.Match', 'Pointis', 'probably', 'personal', 'favorite', 'starring', 'Scarlet', 'Johansson', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'upwardly', 'mobile', 'ambitious', 'tennis', 'coach', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'perfect', 'murder.Midnight', 'Pariswas', 'dreamy', 'sentimental', 'won', 'Oscar', 'best', 'screenplay', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'been', 'nominated', 'staggering', '23', 'times', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winning', 'four', 'times', 'three', 'times', 'Best', 'Original', 'Screenplay', 'once', 'Best', 'Director', 'Annie', 'Hall.Actors', 'who', 'worked', 'have', 'also', 'won', 'Oscars', 'Remember', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'Mighty', 'Aphrodite', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Hannah', 'Sisters.As', 'someone', 'who', 'San', 'Francisco', 'can', 'say', 'almost', 'better', 'reality', 'beige', 'BMW', 'can', 'do', 'wonders', 'enliven', 'surroundings.It', 'good', 'wine', 'Woody', 'just', 'better', 'age', 'easily', 'excellence', 'movie.I', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'hope', 'was', 'helpful']",Blue Jasmine

Yes the critics (and presumably audiences) enjoyed his ""Match Point"" and ""Midnight in Paris"" though for my money the former was a reheated ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" and the latter shallow and certainly light fare compared to the other two films released that year that paid homage to the same time frame (""Hugo"" and ""The Aritist"").This film is a revelation.  There are no Allen stand-ins, no character stuck with a number of ""ya'know""s mirroring one of Allen's stylistic ticks (and one unlooked for in an educated man).  No character overanalyzes the life going on around him. The acting is superb, with not one weak performance.  Indeed, it has few if any Allen fingerprints on it - which is all for the best.  If I did not know any better I'd swear this was written and directed by a young man - such is the  energy and verve everywhere evident.  It has too often been the case that Allen's films' endings seem patched together (see ""Hannah,"" ""Purple Rose,"" ""Annie Hall,"" ""Mighty Aphrodite,"" etc.).  This film however ends brilliantly - it does not appear at all forced.  He also reveals for the first time an ability to cast an eye on those who are not wreathed in wealth, whose daily struggles strive to drown them - people who do more than create art or criticize it, or worse, do nothing at all with their lives and yet have no compunction about it.  One thing I wish Allen would do - incorporate at least one tune performed or written in the past 75 years or, if that proves too much for him, get someone to write an original soundtrack so we are not again subjected wholly to music that at best appears quaint and at worst appears cobwebbed and stale.In sum, this is a Woody Allen film for those who do not enjoy Allen films.",5,From Streetcar to Cablecar,1405555200,"07 17, 2014",2014,1807,"['have', 'been', 'disappointed', 'Allen', 'films', 'Bullets', 'Broadway', 'Yes', 'critics', 'presumably', 'audiences', 'enjoyed', 'Match', 'Point', 'Midnight', 'Paris', 'money', 'former', 'was', 'reheated', 'Crimes', 'Misdemeanors', 'latter', 'shallow', 'certainly', 'light', 'fare', 'compared', 'other', 'two', 'films', 'released', 'year', 'paid', 'homage', 'same', 'time', 'frame', 'Hugo', 'Aritist', '.This', 'film', 'revelation', 'are', 'Allen', 'stand-ins', 'character', 'stuck', 'number', ""ya'know"", 's', 'mirroring', 'one', 'Allen', 'stylistic', 'ticks', 'one', 'unlooked', 'educated', 'man', 'No', 'character', 'life', 'going', 'acting', 'superb', 'not', 'one', 'weak', 'performance', 'Indeed', 'few', 'Allen', 'fingerprints', 'best', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'better', ""'d"", 'swear', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'young', 'man', 'such', 'energy', 'verve', 'everywhere', 'evident', 'too', 'often', 'been', 'case', 'Allen', 'films', 'endings', 'seem', 'patched', 'together', 'see', 'Hannah', 'Purple', 'Rose', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'Mighty', 'Aphrodite', 'etc.', 'film', 'however', 'brilliantly', 'not', 'appear', 'forced', 'also', 'first', 'time', 'ability', 'cast', 'eye', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'wreathed', 'wealth', 'daily', 'strive', 'drown', 'people', 'who', 'do', 'more', 'create', 'art', 'criticize', 'worse', 'do', 'nothing', 'lives', 'yet', 'have', 'compunction', 'One', 'thing', 'wish', 'Allen', 'would', 'do', 'incorporate', 'least', 'one', 'tune', 'performed', 'written', 'past', '75', 'years', 'too', 'much', 'get', 'someone', 'write', 'original', 'soundtrack', 'are', 'not', 'again', 'subjected', 'wholly', 'music', 'best', 'quaint', 'worst', 'cobwebbed', 'stale.In', 'sum', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'film', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'enjoy', 'Allen', 'films']",Blue Jasmine

Intellectually talented but not  quite disciplined enough to maintain herself when her dream world crashes, she hides her depression behind a bravura personality powered by the fantasy  that she is still an important person who understands the best things and knows the best people and is entitled to be treated with the same kid gloves that cushioned her life before the fall when everything that mattered depended on possessions and appearance.Needing help to manage, she descends on her sister, also adopted, who has a very different, working class mentality; who has had to work hard and constantly to make ends meet.  Nothing about the two sisters matches or works together.  We watch as Cate's character and life dissolve into total breakdown.

As Hal's wife, Jasmine enjoys luxury homes in Manhattan and Southampton, extravagant jewelry, designer clothes, lovely vacations and the prestige that comes with being a leading hostess and fundraiser for various New York charities. She plays the part to perfection with her cultured voice and manners and subtle but exquisite taste while turning a willfully blind eye to anything that might be unsavory about Hal, whether it's his business practices or his philandering. When Hal goes to prison after it turns out his wealth is built entirely on scams, Jasmine loses everything, even her son Danny whose bitterness at his father's downfall drives him to drop out of Harvard and disappear. Carrying a Louis Vuitton suitcase and the clothes on her back, Jasmine flies to San Francisco to join her sister Ginger (Sally Hawkins) and try to build a new life for herself. Ginger lacks Jasmine's ethereal looks and chameleon-like adaptability and has settled for a life Jasmine looks down on, working as a clerk in a Mission District grocery store, bringing up two boys from her first marriage (which failed after Ginger and her first husband lost all their money in one of Hal's scams) and dating the volatile but passionate auto mechanic Chili (Bobby Cannavale). The narrative shifts in time from Jasmine's haphazard present-day efforts to start over in San Francisco and the upheaval she causes in Ginger's life to flashbacks of her life with Hal and the events that lead to his downfall, but never confuses the viewer. Jasmine, who has no practical skills other than being a rich man's wife--the woman cannot even operate a computer--tries to maintain a tether to sanity, sort of, while chasing Xanax with vodka. But having been cast completely adrift from the only adult world she has ever known, she is truly lost at sea.There is humor to be found in ""Blue Jasmine,"" but it's bitter humor. I suspect that's because Jasmine is at another level a metaphor for what's going on in the United States. As Jasmine and Hal cavalierly push Ginger and her first husband Augie (Andrew Dice Clay in a surprisingly adept turn) out of the way when they visit New York  and then cost them their shot into the middle class, wealthy capitalists whose fortunes are built not on manufacturing goods or providing services but moving money around and sending jobs offshore are breaching their part of the social contract. The middle class continues to shrink, and the gap between extreme wealth and barely surviving grows ever wider. The wealthy may throw money at ""the losers"" in the form of charity or grants to charter schools, but damned if they'll pay their share of taxes or concern themselves with decent wages.

1658066,A1H9EF4S5I9OKX,B00DL47RQ2,M. Bullions,"[19, 22]","2013 has undeniably been an incredible year for female leading performances. It&#8217;s going to be very hard for the Oscar voters to pick just one. However, one performance from the summer that nobody has forgotten is gaining momentum with each passing award show leading up to the Oscars in early March.I was lucky enough to see &#8220;Blue Jasmine&#8221; in the theater last summer, before all of the awards hoopla began. I suppose I simply never got around to writing a review on it. That&#8217;s my own fault. Rewatching &#8220;Blue Jasmine&#8221; on DVD this afternoon made me realize just what a gem this film was, and how realistic and true to life it is. We rarely see something this honest, this bracingly adult in American cinema. Thank goodness for Woody Allen.Truthfully, I don&#8217;t care for Woody Allen as a person, but it&#8217;s an undeniable fact that he makes incredible films. He&#8217;s gone off the rails and made a few subpar pictures, but even subpar Allen is still better than what you might see at the movie theater most of the time. &#8220;Blue Jasmine&#8221; represents a return to form for the director, who has been in the business for over sixty years. It&#8217;s a fresh and fearless character study that proves he still has stories to tell.Jasmine (Cate Blanchett) leaves her swanky Park Avenue life after her husband, a Bernie Madoff type (Alec Baldwin) is jailed for embezzling millions of dollars. Even though Jasmine is broke, she still manages to get a first class plane ticket to see her sister Ginger (Sally Hawkins), and her boyfriend (Bobby Cannavalle) who she isn&#8217;t particularly fond of. Jasmine stays with her sister and her children, in their modest apartment, and struggles to find work and generally make sense out of what her life has become.Jasmine certainly has varying mental illnesses, although it&#8217;s never clear to the viewer what is the root cause of Jasmine&#8217;s downfall. She&#8217;s constantly drinking and mixing prescription medication, but it appears her body is used to this. Her real mental illness doesn&#8217;t have one root cause. It really is all sorts of things. It&#8217;s mentioned that she had been through a psychiatric facility of some kind after a nervous breakdown, and it&#8217;s clear, with every passing moment, that she may be on the verge of another.Her sister is happy in her humble little life, which really disgusts and enrages Jasmine. She is horrified that her sister has &#8220;settled&#8221; for a life so plain and devoid of everything that made her happy. The two are polar opposites, but our leading lady never quite understands that.The plot is essentially an update on &#8220;A Streetcar Named Desire&#8221;. Jasmine is reminiscent of the 1950&#8217;s housewife whose husband has abandoned her, and has nary a skill to fall back on. Always walking around in gorgeous Chanel jackets and drinking her Stoli martinis (with a twist of lemon) it&#8217;s obvious she is desperate to reclaim the lavish lifestyle that she once had. Ginger has always relied on men to bring her happiness, and in a way, so has Jasmine. Both ladies need to learn to live with what they have become individually, because it&#8217;s hard to rely on a relationship or a marriage to keep a person happy.Her life has been simply swept out from under her. Through flashbacks, we understand Jasmine&#8217;s story more deeply. At the core, this film is about what a person does after their life has fallen apart. Allen has written such a rich character in Jasmine, and no actress other than Blanchett could have played her. The character doesn&#8217;t require an actress of great range (she&#8217;s crazy at the start and crazy at the end), but does require an actress who understands how precise and layered this character is.&#34;Blue Jasmine&#34; is not a comedy, and it doesn&#8217;t leave the viewer feeling all warm and fuzzy at the end. It certainly has its moments of comedic brilliance, but it&#8217;s definitely a drama, more than anything. Jasmine is not a happy person, and her story isn&#8217;t necessarily a pleasant one. But it&#8217;s certainly a ride worth taking.Grade: A+",5,Blue Jasmine: A woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown,1390262400,"01 21, 2014",2014,4163,"['2013', 'undeniably', 'been', 'incredible', 'year', 'female', 'leading', 'performances', '8217', 'going', 'be', 'very', 'hard', 'Oscar', 'voters', 'pick', 'just', 'one', 'However', 'one', 'performance', 'summer', 'nobody', 'forgotten', 'gaining', 'momentum', 'passing', 'award', 'show', 'leading', 'up', 'Oscars', 'early', 'March.I', 'was', 'lucky', 'enough', 'see', '8220', 'Blue', 'Jasmine', '8221', 'theater', 'last', 'summer', 'awards', 'hoopla', 'began', 'suppose', 'simply', 'never', 'got', 'writing', 'review', '8217', 's', 'own', 'fault', 'Rewatching', '8220', 'Blue', 'Jasmine', '8221', 'DVD', 'afternoon', 'made', 'realize', 'just', 'what', 'gem', 'film', 'was', 'how', 'realistic', 'true', 'life', 'rarely', 'see', 'something', 'honest', 'bracingly', 'adult', 'American', 'cinema', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'Woody', 'Allen.Truthfully', 'don', '8217', 'care', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'person', '8217', 'undeniable', 'fact', 'incredible', 'films', '8217', 'gone', 'off', 'rails', 'made', 'few', 'subpar', 'pictures', 'even', 'subpar', 'Allen', 'still', 'better', 'what', 'might', 'see', 'movie', 'theater', 'most', 'time', '8220', 'Blue', 'Jasmine', '8221', 'return', 'form', 'director', 'who', 'been', 'business', 'sixty', 'years', '8217', 's', 'fresh', 'fearless', 'character', 'study', 'still', 'stories', 'tell.Jasmine', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'swanky', 'Park', 'Avenue', 'life', 'husband', 'Bernie', 'Madoff', 'type', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'jailed', 'embezzling', 'millions', 'dollars', 'Even', 'Jasmine', 'broke', 'still', 'get', 'first', 'class', 'plane', 'ticket', 'see', 'sister', 'Ginger', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'boyfriend', 'Bobby', 'Cannavalle', 'who', 'isn', '8217', 'particularly', 'fond', 'Jasmine', 'sister', 'children', 'modest', 'apartment', 'find', 'work', 'generally', 'make', 'sense', 'what', 'life', 'become.Jasmine', 'certainly', 'varying', 'mental', 'illnesses', '8217', 'never', 'clear', 'viewer', 'what', 'root', 'cause', 'Jasmine', '8217', 'downfall', '8217', 'constantly', 'drinking', 'mixing', 'prescription', 'medication', 'body', 'used', 'real', 'mental', 'illness', 'doesn', '8217', 'have', 'one', 'root', 'cause', 'really', 'sorts', 'things', '8217', 'mentioned', 'had', 'been', 'psychiatric', 'facility', 'kind', 'nervous', 'breakdown', '8217', 'clear', 'passing', 'moment', 'may', 'be', 'verge', 'another.Her', 'sister', 'happy', 'humble', 'little', 'life', 'really', 'Jasmine', 'horrified', 'sister', '8220', 'settled', '8221', 'life', 'so', 'plain', 'devoid', 'everything', 'made', 'happy', 'two', 'are', 'polar', 'opposites', 'leading', 'lady', 'never', 'quite', 'that.The', 'plot', 'essentially', 'update', '8220', 'Streetcar', 'Named', 'Desire', '8221', 'Jasmine', 'reminiscent', '1950', '8217', 's', 'housewife', 'husband', 'abandoned', 'nary', 'skill', 'fall', 'back', 'Always', 'walking', 'around', 'gorgeous', 'Chanel', 'jackets', 'drinking', 'Stoli', 'martinis', 'twist', 'lemon', '8217', 'obvious', 'desperate', 'reclaim', 'lavish', 'lifestyle', 'once', 'had', 'Ginger', 'always', 'relied', 'men', 'bring', 'happiness', 'way', 'so', 'Jasmine', 'ladies', 'need', 'learn', 'live', 'what', 'have', 'become', 'individually', '8217', 's', 'hard', 'rely', 'relationship', 'marriage', 'keep', 'person', 'happy.Her', 'life', 'been', 'simply', 'swept', 'out', 'flashbacks', 'understand', 'Jasmine', '8217', 'story', 'more', 'deeply', 'core', 'film', 'what', 'person', 'life', 'fallen', 'apart', 'Allen', 'written', 'rich', 'character', 'Jasmine', 'actress', 'other', 'Blanchett', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'character', 'doesn', '8217', 'require', 'actress', 'great', 'range', '8217', 'crazy', 'start', 'crazy', 'end', 'require', 'actress', 'who', 'how', 'precise', 'layered', 'character', 'is.', '34', 'Blue', 'Jasmine', '34', 'not', 'comedy', '8217', 'leave', 'viewer', 'feeling', 'warm', 'fuzzy', 'end', 'certainly', 'moments', 'comedic', 'brilliance', '8217', 's', 'definitely', 'drama', 'more', 'anything', 'Jasmine', 'not', 'happy', 'person', 'story', 'isn', '8217', 't', 'necessarily', 'pleasant', 'one', '8217', 's', 'certainly', 'ride', 'worth', 'taking.Grade', 'A+']",Blue Jasmine

It doesn't have a strong plotline. Though the action takes place over a period of months, this is an extended vignette about the unraveling of a Manhattan socialite after her husband is convicted of fraudulent investment schemes. We first see Jasmine (Cate Blanchett) as she approaches San Francisco by plane, talking nonstop to the passenger beside her about her marriage and relocation to San Francisco, where she intends to stay with her sister Ginger (Sally Hawkins). Jasmine and Ginger are as different as night and day -Jasmine the WASPy Park Avenue house wife and Ginger a bohemian working class divorc&eacute;e with 2 rambunctious boys. But Jasmine has no where else to go. The Justice Department took all of her husband Hal's (Alec Baldwin) assets, leaving Jasmine to have a nervous breakdown.Woody Allen writes his social dramas and comedies about that which he knows, and for the past decade that has tended to mean the upper classes. Being a monied Manhattanite himself, Allen must know women like Jasmine, who lost everything they thought they had won in life, when their husbands were either convicted of fraud, went bankrupt, or lost their sources of income in the financial crisis. Jasmine is narcissistic, cold, out of touch, and possessed of a ridiculous sense of entitlement. To make her sympathetic is a lot to ask of an actress, but Cate Blanchett makes an anti-hero out of this disturbed, spoiled woman, who is, nevertheless, very fragile and genuinely trying to make ends meet and carve out a new life for herself. Woody Allen's talent for natural dialogue is on display, capturing the interplay of obnoxious people of two different classes on two coasts, as the film flits back and forth in time with Jasmine's memory. The film and its heroine are surprisingly captivating.",5,Surprising Portrait of an Unhinged Socialite Is Allen's Best Work in a Long Time.,1403222400,"06 20, 2014",2014,1960,"['Blue', 'Jasmine', ""n't"", 'possess', 'comic', 'element', 'many', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'films', 'do', 'best', 'film', 'Allen', 'written', 'directed', 'twenty', 'years', ""n't"", 'have', 'strong', 'plotline', 'action', 'place', 'period', 'months', 'extended', 'vignette', 'unraveling', 'Manhattan', 'socialite', 'husband', 'convicted', 'fraudulent', 'investment', 'schemes', 'first', 'see', 'Jasmine', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'San', 'Francisco', 'plane', 'talking', 'nonstop', 'passenger', 'marriage', 'relocation', 'San', 'Francisco', 'where', 'stay', 'sister', 'Ginger', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'Jasmine', 'Ginger', 'are', 'as', 'different', 'night', 'day', '-Jasmine', 'WASPy', 'Park', 'Avenue', 'house', 'wife', 'Ginger', 'bohemian', 'working', 'class', 'divorc', 'eacute', '2', 'rambunctious', 'boys', 'Jasmine', 'where', 'else', 'go', 'Justice', 'Department', 'took', 'husband', 'Hal', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'assets', 'leaving', 'Jasmine', 'have', 'nervous', 'breakdown.Woody', 'Allen', 'social', 'dramas', 'comedies', 'past', 'decade', 'tended', 'mean', 'upper', 'classes', 'Being', 'monied', 'Manhattanite', 'Allen', 'must', 'know', 'women', 'Jasmine', 'who', 'lost', 'everything', 'thought', 'had', 'won', 'life', 'when', 'husbands', 'were', 'either', 'convicted', 'fraud', 'went', 'bankrupt', 'lost', 'sources', 'income', 'financial', 'crisis', 'Jasmine', 'narcissistic', 'cold', 'touch', 'possessed', 'ridiculous', 'sense', 'entitlement', 'make', 'sympathetic', 'lot', 'ask', 'actress', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'anti-hero', 'out', 'disturbed', 'spoiled', 'woman', 'who', 'nevertheless', 'very', 'fragile', 'genuinely', 'trying', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'carve', 'out', 'new', 'life', 'herself', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'talent', 'natural', 'dialogue', 'display', 'capturing', 'interplay', 'obnoxious', 'people', 'two', 'different', 'classes', 'two', 'coasts', 'film', 'back', 'forth', 'time', 'Jasmine', 'memory', 'film', 'heroine', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'captivating']",Blue Jasmine

Oleson,"[1, 3]","Woody Allen's 45th film takes him away from his recent foray's to Europe and plants his cast in San Francisco with extended flashback scenes in New York.  While the situation is hardly funny, there are enough elements to certainly put the film in the category of dark comedy.  Jasmine (Cate Blanchett) is the wife of Hal (Alec Baldwin), a wealthy beyond description, investment banker who just so happens to be a white collar crook, unbeknownst to Jasmine.  She is the woman who knows how to live the good life but pays no attention to what's going on around her, especially when it comes to business.  Her business is shopping and hosting elaborate dinner parties.We find much of this out as Jasmine visits her sister, now single Ginger (Sally Hawkins) and her two bratty sons.  Each make a big point out of the fact that they are not biological sisters.  Both were adopted and raised by the same family, but Ginger always says, Jasmine has the better genes.  Ginger, by Jasmine's account has the worst taste in men beginning with her husband Augie who is in construction.  He's played surprisingly well by Andrew Dice Clay.  Upon Jasmine's arrival, Ginger is about to get engaged to Chili, a mechanic played by Bobby Cannavale.Both men are a little rough around the edges and certainly the antithesis of smooth and sophisticated Hal.  But yeah, Hal's a crook.  Not only that, he's a womanizer and everyone knew, except for Jasmine.  Or maybe she knew and just looked the other way.  Enough was enough and in a fit of rage Jasmine, pulls the plug on Hal's business shenanigans.  Jasmine had no idea that the government would strip her of all of her wealth as well.Allen turns Blanchett loose on her character and she is amazing, going from a beautiful socialite concerned about appearances and her next visit to the Mediterranean to a groveling drunk on high doses of Xanax.  A woman with no visible skills, no money and no idea of how to proceed, she's a train wreck.  You'll feel sorry for her by the end of the film.  While Blanchett's performance is sure to get Oscar's attention, the rest of the film bogs down much too often, going over some of the same territory.  While I thought Clay's performance was an eye opener, Louis C. K.'s as a married man having a brief fling with Ginger, wasn't.

Over the years, Mr. Allen has built a stock company of actors,such as Rob Reiner, Julie Kavner and Joy Behar. Another standout in the film is the soundtrack of the film, with the exception of Louis Armstrong, most of the singers of the jazz tunes are unknown to me in particular. That goes along with the fact that Mr.Allen never attends the Oscars and on Monday night perfers to keep his regular gig in New York.The reason I titled my review as I did is the character of Jasmine has one messed up life and comes to stay with her sister, Ginger, played by Ms.Hawkins.

Now comes his latest movie.""Blue Jasmine"" (2013 release; 98 min.) brings the story of Jasmine (played by Cate Blanchett). As the movie opens, we see her arriving in San Francisco, moving in with her sister Ginger (played by Sally Hawkins). We soon learn that Jasmine is on the 'rebound'. The movie from there on intercuts between flashbacks of Jasmine's previous glitzy life in New York with her husband (played by Alec Baldwin) and how Jasmine is adopting to living with her sister. To tell you much more about the story would surely ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: first, writer-director Woody Allen is ageing like a good wine and in the last 5-6 years seems to have found a second (or is that third? or fourth?) wind in his career. Second, this movie bursts at the seams with outstanding acting performances. Yes, Cate Blanchett is getting a lot of press and Oscar buzz with her brilliant performance of tormented Jasmine, as well she should. But there are lots of other notables, for starters Sally Hawkins, an English actress whom I had seen before in a couple of movies (including ""An Education"") but for the first time really blew me away in her role as the insecure younger sister. Then there is Bobby Cannavale as Chili, the hot-headed boyfriend of Ginger. in an equally surprising role. And how about Peter Sarsgaard, this time in a very much restrained role as Dwight, Jasmine's possible next husband. As it happens, I just saw Sarsgaard earlier this week in another movie, ""Lovelace"", in a head-turning role that couldn't be further away from his role here.If it sounds like I am gushing about this movie, I am. This is one of the very best movies of the year for me so far, right up there with ""Frances Ha"" (I imagine Cate Blanchett and Greta Gerwig will be duking it out for the Best Actress Oscar). Woody Allen, never one to rest on his laurels, is already shooting his next movie (set in Southern France), set to be released in '14.

1658118,A1MC81HLJ6Z9ZQ,B00DL47RQ2,Paul McGrath,"[13, 20]","This is an interesting film about a woman, Jasmine, played by Cate Blanchett, whose life is turned completely upside-down and who becomes mentally unhinged.  It is a fascinating character study and a brilliant acting performance.  But the movie as a whole, directed and written by Woody Allen, stumbles on many different levels.It begins as she is flying to San Francisco to live with her sister, a woman she does not know well and did not associate with during her good years.  In flashback we see her previous life in Manhattan.  Her husband was a financial whiz and she lived a life of almost unimaginable luxury, with furs, jewels, beach homes on the Atlantic and European vacations.  But it turns out her husband was a crook.  He was imprisoned, and at the film's beginning we see that she has lost it all.  Everything.The first problem with the film is the setting. We are meant to know Jasmine's sister is very much a blue-collar type.  Blue-collar types?  In San Francisco?  Uhh, no.  San Francisco hasn't been a blue-collar town for about fifty years.  It is a very wealthy city and barely a drop down at all from Manhattan.  To emphasize her fall from grace a more appropriate setting would have been a true blue-collar town:  a Midwest burg like Akron, Ohio;  or Gary, Indiana.  San Francisco is just too glamorous for this.Woody seems to understand this at some level.  The beautiful San Francisco is barely emphasized;  the viewer mostly sees it from a dreary perspective, which is, frankly, hard to do.This problem extends to the secondary characters as well.  The sister is a grocery clerk, her boyfriend is a mechanic, her ex-husband is a contractor, and her new love interest is a sound system installer.  All of them are loud, overbearing types.  The point of their existence in the film is to contrast them with the elegant, disdainful Jasmine, but again, it doesn't work.  These types really don't exist too much in stylish San Francisco.  These are Brooklyn guys, north Jersey guys.Finally, the musical score, the 20's jazz music which Woody loves and which he uses in all his films, just doesn't work.  In a light comedy, sure;  in a semi-serious drama, sure;  in a serious drama as an ironic counterpoint, sure.  But here, in this unrelenting grim tale of a woman's descent into horror and madness, no.  It is instead jarring and woefully out of place.Having said all of this, though, the film is fascinating because of the incredible performance of Cate Blanchett.  Her character is an emotionally fragile, self-centered, self-absorbed person who, in New York, we see, was able to get away with it.  Her wealth protected her.But in San Francisco, without means, and surrounded by people she openly disdains, her fragility is overwhelming.  She pops pills, she drinks excessively.  She tries so hard to maintain what she believes to be her dignity, but she is simply not capable of this, coming across instead as vindictive, haughty, and demeaning.  It is so well done that in many instances it can be difficult to watch.There is an incredible scene in which she is in her sister's apartment, describing to her how humiliating it was when, after her husband's demise, she had to work in a Manhattan shoe store, waiting on those that she formerly entertained at dinner parties.  It was just a terrible ordeal, you see.  She is lying on her back on the couch, wailing dramatically, waving her hands emphatically above her.  We truly feel her anguish;  it is an incredibly pitiable scene.  (Yes, despite the fact that it is only because she had to work in a shoe store.)  There are dozens of other scenes like this.  Blanchett's performance is a pitch-perfect, dreadfully mesmerizing experience.For this then, the movie is commendable.  It is too bad, though, that so much the rest of it is off-key.  It' beginning to look like Woody, who has been a wealthy filmmaker for many years now, is out of touch.",3,Blanchett Superb in Mediocre Allen Film,1391385600,"02 3, 2014",2014,3924,"['interesting', 'film', 'woman', 'Jasmine', 'played', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'life', 'turned', 'completely', 'upside-down', 'who', 'mentally', 'unhinged', 'fascinating', 'character', 'study', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'performance', 'movie', 'whole', 'directed', 'written', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'many', 'different', 'levels.It', 'flying', 'San', 'Francisco', 'live', 'sister', 'woman', 'not', 'know', 'well', 'did', 'not', 'associate', 'good', 'years', 'flashback', 'see', 'previous', 'life', 'Manhattan', 'husband', 'was', 'financial', 'whiz', 'lived', 'life', 'almost', 'unimaginable', 'luxury', 'furs', 'jewels', 'beach', 'homes', 'Atlantic', 'European', 'vacations', 'out', 'husband', 'was', 'crook', 'was', 'imprisoned', 'film', 'beginning', 'see', 'lost', 'Everything.The', 'first', 'problem', 'film', 'setting', 'are', 'meant', 'know', 'Jasmine', 'sister', 'very', 'much', 'blue-collar', 'type', 'Blue-collar', 'types', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Uhh', 'San', 'Francisco', ""n't"", 'been', 'blue-collar', 'town', 'fifty', 'years', 'very', 'wealthy', 'city', 'barely', 'drop', 'down', 'Manhattan', 'emphasize', 'fall', 'grace', 'more', 'appropriate', 'setting', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'true', 'blue-collar', 'town', 'Midwest', 'burg', 'Akron', 'Ohio', 'Gary', 'Indiana', 'San', 'Francisco', 'just', 'too', 'glamorous', 'this.Woody', 'understand', 'level', 'beautiful', 'San', 'Francisco', 'barely', 'emphasized', 'viewer', 'mostly', 'dreary', 'perspective', 'frankly', 'hard', 'do.This', 'problem', 'secondary', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'sister', 'grocery', 'clerk', 'boyfriend', 'mechanic', 'ex-husband', 'contractor', 'new', 'love', 'interest', 'sound', 'system', 'installer', 'are', 'loud', 'overbearing', 'types', 'point', 'existence', 'film', 'contrast', 'elegant', 'disdainful', 'Jasmine', 'again', ""n't"", 'work', 'types', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'exist', 'too', 'much', 'stylish', 'San', 'Francisco', 'are', 'Brooklyn', 'guys', 'north', 'Jersey', 'guys.Finally', 'musical', 'score', '20', 'jazz', 'music', 'Woody', 'loves', 'films', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'light', 'comedy', 'sure', 'semi-serious', 'drama', 'sure', 'serious', 'drama', 'ironic', 'counterpoint', 'sure', 'here', 'unrelenting', 'grim', 'tale', 'woman', 'descent', 'horror', 'madness', 'instead', 'jarring', 'woefully', 'place.Having', 'said', 'though', 'film', 'fascinating', 'incredible', 'performance', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'character', 'emotionally', 'fragile', 'self-centered', 'self-absorbed', 'person', 'who', 'New', 'York', 'see', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'away', 'Her', 'wealth', 'protected', 'her.But', 'San', 'Francisco', 'means', 'surrounded', 'people', 'openly', 'fragility', 'overwhelming', 'pills', 'excessively', 'so', 'hard', 'maintain', 'what', 'be', 'dignity', 'simply', 'not', 'capable', 'coming', 'across', 'instead', 'vindictive', 'haughty', 'demeaning', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'many', 'instances', 'can', 'be', 'difficult', 'watch.There', 'incredible', 'scene', 'sister', 'apartment', 'describing', 'how', 'humiliating', 'was', 'when', 'husband', 'demise', 'had', 'work', 'Manhattan', 'shoe', 'store', 'waiting', 'formerly', 'entertained', 'dinner', 'parties', 'was', 'just', 'terrible', 'ordeal', 'see', 'lying', 'back', 'couch', 'wailing', 'dramatically', 'waving', 'hands', 'emphatically', 'truly', 'feel', 'anguish', 'incredibly', 'pitiable', 'scene', 'Yes', 'fact', 'only', 'had', 'work', 'shoe', 'store', 'are', 'dozens', 'other', 'scenes', 'Blanchett', 'performance', 'pitch-perfect', 'dreadfully', 'mesmerizing', 'experience.For', 'then', 'movie', 'commendable', 'too', 'bad', 'though', 'so', 'much', 'rest', 'off-key', 'beginning', 'look', 'Woody', 'who', 'been', 'wealthy', 'filmmaker', 'many', 'years', 'now', 'touch']",Blue Jasmine

1658123,A2PPJN8OKSXMPT,B00DL47RQ2,Pippin O' Rohan,"[5, 8]","A well-established matriarch in her circle, a strong creative woman past ninety with a mind of fine steel, vitality and fun, wrote this early morning from far way: 'Are you surviving New York in Siberia! Look to the skies for snowflakes with bright eyes, it may bring warmer weather your way. Write soonest as I am concerned'. To which I replied: 'You are a gem to write this early morning here, and I am up and about doing the laundry, musing about the story of a rich American woman who loses everything in this Great Recession, and her husband, a powerful corrupt banker on Wall Street, who ends up in jail. It certainly is realistic and timely. Not all of these women are prepared for these sudden life changes, and not all of them survive in such circumstances'.Having enjoyed tremendously Mr. Woody Allen's last brilliant feat where he takes the viewers into the world of surrealism on a visit to Rome, I was looking forward to seeing his &#34;Blue Jasmine&#34;, which brings us back to a harsh look at some realities today in the U.S., more precisely the impact that the Recession has brought on some of the women among us.We are perhaps more attune to listening to the stories of the poorest among us with more empathy than the one of Jasmine's on Wall Street, and yet it made this viewer wonder about women who live in high society, and who overnight so to speak, and as one viewer aptly said, find that their crystal carriage has turned into a large pumpkin before midnight. Having witnessed as a child in another era, two beautiful and privileged American women, close courageous friends take the plunge, one fatally, and the other who endured and went on to great heights, the fate of Jasmine was of particular interest to this viewer, and served once again as a reminder of the importance of staying alert and awake, regardless of the choices you make in life. It is fine if women wish to marry for both love, money and fame, but their rich husbands may be heartless misers for instance, and their wives might have been better off with an honest tax accountant who adores them, and offers them a sable coat, or a sapphire necklace from a Madison Avenue boutique for their birthday. But some of these women also want to make an entrance into a world where sparkling pedigree counts among the elite, and this requires hard work on their part. Have I ever met and enjoyed the friendship of a Jasmine? I have, but her story is a pink one after some hard knocks along the way, and this was a long time ago.On viewing Jasmine's sudden decline into dismal poverty where she is thrown into the cold street and takes flight where she can hide, in the way of a wounded animal, and attempts a geographical escape as well, she is so frightened that for a woman whose sense of direction has always been somewhat centered on the edge of reality, she ends up finding herself in what she considers 'Hell', precipitating her even faster into both a mental and physical decline. And, for some of the viewers who watch her descent into such a dark pitfall, they may soon realize that Jasmine, in shock and severely traumatized, is no longer able to make a decision, or function in any way. There are some people around who want to help her, at least in the beginning by telling her in one way, or another to stand up and start again by getting a new pair of 'shades', or simply a new life, which she is not able to manage although she gives it a shaky attempt. She is completely isolated in a bubble and has lost all, including love in every way and its many comforts. The vast divide between the two realities of her world is too powerful for her to take in. She has no safety-net to speak of, and is so vulnerable that the only fictitious woman I could think of, to match hers in degradation, is that of Sasha Jensen's, the creation of the late Jean Rhys, where one is also left wondering as to what it might be to feel the loss of the very essence of one's being.Is there hope for Jasmine at the end, as we see her sitting alone on a park bench? It might in fact take a kindly stranger with some help, to bring her gently back to her feet and serves as a reminder that there are some good people who walk among us. For this viewer, &#34;Blue Jasmine&#34; is yet another outstanding masterpiece from Mr. Woody Allen, with the help of Ms. Cate Blanchett, one of the most brilliant actresses in our times today, amidst a few others. Congratulations to both of them. Together they make a fine working team, and the story of &#34;Blue Jasmine&#34; will remain memorable for this viewer with highest appreciation.

Jeanette French, or as she is called now, Jasmine, arrives in San Francisco to live with her divorced sister and her two children. Jasmine has bent the ear of her seat mate, an elderly lady, on a plane from New York to San Francisco. Non stop talking, the elderly lady can't get away fast enough.Jasmine has become penniless, even though she flew First Class and has expensive luggage and wears Chanel clothing. Her husband, a Bernie Maddoff take-off played by Alec Baldwin, has died and all their money is gone. Jasmine completely deconstructs,comes apart at the seams. Her medicine she calls Edison, electricity, which means ECT's for Bi-Polar. We have no idea if she is taking any medicine other than Xanax and Vodka, but we bet not.Sister, Ginger, played by Sally Hawkins, is generous in spirit and tries her best to help Jasmine. Ginger bags groceries, takes care of her two boys, and loves her new boyfriend, played by Bobby Connavale. Each and every performance in this film is top notch, but, no one can compare to Care Blanchette. She takes this role and leaves everyone else in the dust. I was mesmerized by her performance, as is everyone who sees this film.This film is true life, everyone around Jasmine is reaching out to her, but Jasmine has her sights set on something big, something to help her forget her philandering husband who embarrassed her so. Jasmine has no real skills to get back to, no profession to fall back on, just her sister who is part of the working class, from which Jasmine wants to escape.A bravura performance that will sweep all the awards. Cate Blanchette makes Jasmine all too real, her world collapsing, and she has no way to stop it.Highly Recommended. prisrob 01-21-14",4,Superb,1390262400,"01 21, 2014",2014,1832,"['Cate', 'Blanchette', 'Oscar', 'fabulous', 'performance', 'woman', 'who', 'had', 'everything', 'now', 'edge', 'Jeanette', 'French', 'called', 'now', 'Jasmine', 'San', 'Francisco', 'live', 'divorced', 'sister', 'two', 'children', 'Jasmine', 'bent', 'ear', 'seat', 'mate', 'elderly', 'lady', 'plane', 'New', 'York', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Non', 'stop', 'talking', 'elderly', 'lady', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'away', 'fast', 'enough.Jasmine', 'become', 'penniless', 'even', 'flew', 'First', 'Class', 'expensive', 'luggage', 'wears', 'Chanel', 'clothing', 'husband', 'Bernie', 'Maddoff', 'take-off', 'played', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'died', 'money', 'gone', 'Jasmine', 'completely', 'apart', 'seams', 'medicine', 'Edison', 'electricity', 'ECT', 'Bi-Polar', 'have', 'idea', 'taking', 'medicine', 'other', 'Xanax', 'Vodka', 'bet', 'not.Sister', 'Ginger', 'played', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'generous', 'spirit', 'best', 'help', 'Jasmine', 'Ginger', 'bags', 'groceries', 'care', 'two', 'boys', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'played', 'Bobby', 'Connavale', 'performance', 'film', 'top', 'notch', 'one', 'can', 'compare', 'Care', 'Blanchette', 'role', 'everyone', 'else', 'dust', 'was', 'mesmerized', 'performance', 'everyone', 'who', 'film.This', 'film', 'true', 'life', 'everyone', 'around', 'Jasmine', 'reaching', 'out', 'Jasmine', 'sights', 'set', 'something', 'big', 'something', 'help', 'forget', 'philandering', 'husband', 'who', 'embarrassed', 'so', 'Jasmine', 'real', 'skills', 'get', 'back', 'profession', 'fall', 'back', 'just', 'sister', 'who', 'part', 'working', 'class', 'Jasmine', 'escape.A', 'bravura', 'performance', 'will', 'sweep', 'awards', 'Cate', 'Blanchette', 'Jasmine', 'too', 'real', 'world', 'collapsing', 'way', 'stop', 'it.Highly', 'Recommended', 'prisrob', '01-21-14']",Blue Jasmine
1658125,A39IY0JU5JI69G,B00DL47RQ2,"Promise ""promise""","[3, 8]","Much has been made about Cate Blanchett's performance and I am in total accord with the acclaim.  She played ""Blanche DuBois"" in ""Streetcar Names Desire"" on Broadway and I'm sure that that did a lot to inform and deepen her performance as ""Jasmine"" here.  (It's interesting that her last name in ""Blanchett""---maybe these are roles she was born to play?)  At any rate she is wonderful here and in my opinion, she rescued the role from what could have been a two dimensional caricature.Sally Hawlings, too, was very good as her sister, and saved her from being another working class stereotype.  Her various men friends are fun to watch but I'm afraid they do fall into the category of types.  Another reviewer commented that they seem to be more from New Jersey than San Francisco.  Alec Baldwin is the quintessential charming bad guy...maybe another role he was born to play?  The rest of the cast is just fine, too.Cinematography is great, costumes, scenery...all first rate.  The only problem I had with the film was the script.  And that's major.  I don't think Allen decided if this is to be a satire or comedy, a farce or a political comment, a human tragedy or a morality play.  It is engaging, as all of Allen's films are and Blanchett takes the ball and runs with it.  She's so interesting to watch and so beautiful, that the time in the theater flew by until the credits rolled...when I heard people all over the theater say ""That's it?""  Yes, those of us who go to art-house films are supposed to be grown up and not expect ""Hollywood"" endings where ""everything's wrapped up neatly in a bow"" but still it would have been nice to have some sense of resolution.  It was sort of like a Beethovan symphony where Beethovan forgets to put in the final chords.As for the comparison to ""Streetcar"" the difference between Williams and Allen is that Williams loved his characters so  when  Blanche was taken away to the insane asylum the viewer wept.  It was a true tragedy.  As for Jasmine here, I didn't shed any tears. In spite of all that Blanchett did to bring a soul to her she still remains someone I didn't really care about.  It's not her fault and I hope she gets the Oscar nomination she deserves.  Acting students may well want to watch the film for her performance.

I didn't see it coming. You may be shocked at how she puts her life at risk.Once she decides she needs to get her life together she puts her best effort forward but is harassed by her employer. As she seeks to find herself a new husband she plays a part she really thinks could become her reality.All the while we see her mental illness taking over. The more she tries to hide her past life the worse things get.What amazed me about this movie is how well Cate Blanchett acts throughout. She truly understood what it is like to lose your mind. Anyone who has been there will relate.I will say I was completely captivated with the movie right until the end when the unimaginable occurs. I won't say what happens but to be honest it was a bit of a disappointment. You are sort of left wondering how the main character is going to survive on her own. I wanted a happy ending for sure.

1658152,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00DL47RQ2,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 0]","Woody Allen&#8217;s &#8220;Blue Jasmine&#8221; is essentially &#8220;A Streetcar Named Desire&#8221; with flashbacks and a slightly altered back story. Jasmine is a booze-swilling, truth-bending, mentally unstable socialite who is forced to move in with her lower-class sister, Ginger (Sally Hawkins), after she falls on hard times, a result of her scheming, womanizing Bernie Madoff of a husband (Alec Baldwin) being imprisoned for fraud and subsequently committing suicide. Ginger&#8217;s boyfriend, Chili (Bobby Cannavale), is the rude, crude Stanley Kowalski of the piece who resents Jasmine&#8217;s sudden intrusion into the couple&#8217;s life.Despite serving as a showcase for a bravura performance by Cate Blanchett, &#8220;Blue Jasmine&#8221; is clearly one of Allen&#8216;s lesser works of recent times. This isn&#8217;t the first time that Allen has reached back to the classics for inspiration, yet, since he&#8217;s borrowing much of his themes and insights from Tennessee Williams anyway, why not at least apply some of his trademark comic spin to the material? Alas, humor is strangely lacking in much of the screenplay, which plays out the class conflict between Jasmine and Chili in largely predictable fashion.What makes &#8220;Blue Jasmine&#8221; ultimately worth checking out, however, is Blanchett&#8217;s richly textured portrait of a woman who has always been too willing to put her fate in the hands of others, principally men, and too willing to look the other way when not to do so could jeopardize her own position of privilege in society. She is clearly a woman who refuses to take even the slightest bit of responsibility for any of the choices she&#8217;s made in her life. Yet, for all her oddball attributes, Jasmine, thanks to Ms. Banchett, can&#8217;t help but touch the viewer&#8217;s heart with her air of unquiet desperation. Jasmine may be utterly self-absorbed, but one senses that she speaks constantly about herself and her tribulations to anyone who&#8217;ll listen (and even to those who won&#8217;t) for the simple reason that, to her mind at least, if she were ever to stop doing so, she would simply cease to exist as an entity in the world.In a large cast, Louis C.K. and Peter Sarsgaard provide additional love interests for Ginger and Jasmine, respectively.The parallels to &#8220;Streetcar&#8221; are numerous but by no means slavish (&#8220;Stanley&#8221; here is a much more decent fella&#8217; overall and &#8220;Mitch&#8221; is not one of his buddies), but the movie is at its best when it moves away from those parallels and heads off in its own direction, freeing Blanchett up to do her own thing.",3,Blanchett triumphs over a derivative script,1392249600,"02 13, 2014",2014,2653,"['Woody', 'Allen', '8217', '8220', 'Blue', 'Jasmine', '8221', 'essentially', '8220', 'Streetcar', 'Named', 'Desire', '8221', 'flashbacks', 'slightly', 'altered', 'back', 'story', 'Jasmine', 'booze-swilling', 'truth-bending', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'socialite', 'who', 'forced', 'move', 'lower-class', 'sister', 'Ginger', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'hard', 'times', 'result', 'scheming', 'womanizing', 'Bernie', 'Madoff', 'husband', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'being', 'imprisoned', 'fraud', 'subsequently', 'committing', 'suicide', 'Ginger', '8217', 's', 'boyfriend', 'Chili', 'Bobby', 'Cannavale', 'rude', 'crude', 'Stanley', 'Kowalski', 'piece', 'who', 'Jasmine', '8217', 'sudden', 'intrusion', 'couple', '8217', 'life.Despite', 'serving', 'showcase', 'bravura', 'performance', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', '8220', 'Blue', 'Jasmine', '8221', 'clearly', 'one', 'Allen', '8216', 'lesser', 'works', 'recent', 'times', 'isn', '8217', 't', 'first', 'time', 'Allen', 'reached', 'back', 'classics', 'inspiration', 'yet', '8217', 's', 'borrowing', 'much', 'themes', 'insights', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'anyway', 'why', 'not', 'least', 'apply', 'trademark', 'comic', 'spin', 'material', 'Alas', 'humor', 'strangely', 'lacking', 'much', 'screenplay', 'out', 'class', 'conflict', 'Jasmine', 'Chili', 'largely', 'predictable', 'fashion.What', '8220', 'Blue', 'Jasmine', '8221', 'ultimately', 'checking', 'out', 'however', 'Blanchett', '8217', 'richly', 'textured', 'portrait', 'woman', 'who', 'always', 'been', 'too', 'willing', 'put', 'fate', 'hands', 'others', 'principally', 'men', 'too', 'willing', 'look', 'other', 'way', 'when', 'not', 'do', 'so', 'could', 'jeopardize', 'own', 'position', 'privilege', 'society', 'clearly', 'woman', 'who', 'take', 'even', 'slightest', 'bit', 'responsibility', 'choices', '8217', 'made', 'life', 'oddball', 'Jasmine', 'thanks', 'Ms.', 'Banchett', 'can', '8217', 'help', 'touch', 'viewer', '8217', 's', 'heart', 'air', 'unquiet', 'desperation', 'Jasmine', 'may', 'be', 'utterly', 'self-absorbed', 'one', 'constantly', 'herself', 'tribulations', 'anyone', 'who', '8217', 'listen', 'even', 'who', 'won', '8217', 't', 'simple', 'reason', 'mind', 'least', 'were', 'ever', 'stop', 'doing', 'so', 'would', 'simply', 'cease', 'exist', 'entity', 'world.In', 'large', 'cast', 'Louis', 'C.K', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'provide', 'additional', 'love', 'interests', 'Ginger', 'Jasmine', 'respectively.The', 'parallels', '8220', 'Streetcar', '8221', 'are', 'numerous', 'means', 'slavish', '8220', 'Stanley', '8221', 'here', 'much', 'more', 'decent', 'fella', '8217', 'overall', '8220', 'Mitch', '8221', 'not', 'one', 'buddies', 'movie', 'best', 'when', 'away', 'parallels', 'heads', 'off', 'own', 'direction', 'freeing', 'Blanchett', 'up', 'do', 'own', 'thing']",Blue Jasmine

Some, having seen so many of Cate Blanchett's strong performances in the past, are eager to heap praise on her portrayal of the disintegrating ex-wife of a Bernie Madoff type con man.  Others praise or pan this film based on their feelings regarding writer/director Woody Allen.  Some, having seen press releases saying that Blue Jasmine is a modern version of &#34;A Streetcar Named Desire&#34; are afraid to offer it anything other than fulsome praise.  It's the film folks, the film... and it's not particularly good.Cate Blanchett does a workmanlike job in this film; she is solid as the unstable Jasmine, but not spectacular.  Put away all flowery adjectives for another day.  Blanchett's brittle reactions work well, but don't require her to stretch beyond her previous performances.  She has portrayed Americans so often that the accent must be like a comfy old coat for her.  No points there.Woody Allen has obviously admired &#34;A Streetcar Named Desire&#34; for a long time; he gave a humorous performance as Blanche in his funny-era &#34;Sleeper.&#34;  But did he deliver any fresh insights by modernizing it?  No.  How about:  &#34;We are all frauds to some degree, hiding behind our own pretensions&#34;?  Nope; that's not new.  How about: &#34;The happiest person is someone who knows his place, however lowly&#34;?  Nope; it's downright offensive for Americans too.  That &#34;know your place&#34; nonsense is fine for the British, but not for a nation of strivers.  Of course, since Allen stopped parodying the pretentious and joined them, I've wished that he stopped striving too.  Oh, well...  One can dream.In any case, Blanchett will go on, one day possibly meriting the praise she received for this film.  And Allen's &#34;Midnight in Paris&#34; shows that he hasn't completely forgotten his sense of humor.

1658167,AWUUMER0F3WF4,B00DL47RQ2,Sheryl Fechter,"[5, 7]","Switch back to Jasmine French's (Cate Blanchett) former life.  Married to an affluent conman, Hal (Alec Baldwin), helping herself to a life of luxury and steeped in denial, preferring to remain aloof to his decision making and philandering.  Jasmine is the perfect upper crust wife, has an elegance and style, even a slightly tipped accent to her voice that is so believable each time we flashback to what once was her life on New York's Park Avenue.  One could look at the film in comparison to ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" with the deeply troubled Blanche Dubois, as its plot plays similar at times.  I thought its content was effectively able to stand alone in this smartly done character portrayal of a woman coming apart at the seams, but in a totally different light.The movie opens with Jasmine chatting away to the woman seated next to her on the airplane, taking her to San Francisco to see her estranged adopted sister, Ginger (Sally Hawkins). She has suffered an emotional breakdown over trauma she has gone through with Hal, this is now causing a flight of topics that come right out regardless if she has an audience in conversation.  She will blurt forth whatever is on her mind without thought or the ability to pause.She takes Xanax for the extreme anxiety that she feels, while chasing it down with vodka Martinis with a twist of lemon, and remains in a state of self-absorbed oblivion.  Jasmine is unfairly judgmental of Ginger's working-class lifestyle. There was a time that Ginger and her ex-husband made a life altering financial investment with Hal and could have made quite a lot of money. Hal's fortune was built on scams, shady practices, and now Jasmine has finally left, and Ginger has lost all of her money also.  Ginger has moved on with her life along with her two younger boys while Jasmine is just now able to move forward while trudging along with the emotional wreckage that has become her reality.She moves in with her sister, forcing her boyfriend, Chili (Bobby Cannavale), to find another place to live while she begins the uphill battle that will become her world.  After the relationship with Hal blew up, it seems as if Jasmine lost her whole identity, she cannot gain her footing in a life that she is not used to, and cannot seem to live without a man, if only vicariously.  She must start working and does so for a dentist, this causes its own set of problems.Jasmine is a very complicated woman that I had extreme concern for, empathy, and pity, as I rooted for her life to get better.  There actually was a point where I did gain confidence that she was going to get ahead, although the upheaval overwhelming her kept running right over her at the same times finding it a feckless issue.  She does take advantage of other people; especially her sister, and a man she meets named Dwight (Peter Sarsgaard), who begins a romantic interest in her.  If only she could stop lying, being far too expansive with the truth, or completely denying anything she is fully responsible for.  She is the type of woman who will challenge your tolerance constantly.Narcissistic, hedonistic, and even selfish at times, Jasmine French will not be liked by everyone.  I found her so complex and emotionally broken that I wanted to shield her and stop her at the same time.  Her reckless decision making, based on untruths, kept concerning me.  The film presents a well thought out and working character portrayal of Jasmine French, that I have no doubt will stick with me for quite a while.",5,"""There Are Only So Many Traumas One Can Withstand"" - Jasmine",1393718400,"03 2, 2014",2014,3513,"['Switch', 'back', 'Jasmine', 'French', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'former', 'life', 'Married', 'affluent', 'conman', 'Hal', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'helping', 'life', 'luxury', 'steeped', 'denial', 'preferring', 'remain', 'aloof', 'decision', 'making', 'philandering', 'Jasmine', 'perfect', 'upper', 'crust', 'wife', 'elegance', 'style', 'even', 'slightly', 'tipped', 'accent', 'voice', 'so', 'believable', 'time', 'flashback', 'what', 'once', 'was', 'life', 'New', 'York', 'Park', 'Avenue', 'One', 'could', 'look', 'film', 'comparison', 'A', 'Streetcar', 'Named', 'Desire', 'deeply', 'troubled', 'Blanche', 'Dubois', 'plot', 'plays', 'similar', 'times', 'thought', 'content', 'was', 'effectively', 'able', 'stand', 'alone', 'smartly', 'done', 'character', 'portrayal', 'woman', 'coming', 'apart', 'seams', 'totally', 'different', 'light.The', 'movie', 'Jasmine', 'chatting', 'away', 'woman', 'seated', 'next', 'airplane', 'taking', 'San', 'Francisco', 'see', 'estranged', 'adopted', 'sister', 'Ginger', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'suffered', 'emotional', 'breakdown', 'trauma', 'gone', 'Hal', 'now', 'causing', 'flight', 'topics', 'come', 'right', 'regardless', 'audience', 'conversation', 'will', 'blurt', 'forth', 'mind', 'thought', 'ability', 'pause.She', 'Xanax', 'extreme', 'anxiety', 'chasing', 'down', 'vodka', 'Martinis', 'twist', 'lemon', 'state', 'self-absorbed', 'oblivion', 'Jasmine', 'unfairly', 'judgmental', 'Ginger', 'working-class', 'lifestyle', 'was', 'time', 'Ginger', 'ex-husband', 'made', 'life', 'altering', 'financial', 'investment', 'Hal', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'quite', 'lot', 'money', 'Hal', 'fortune', 'was', 'built', 'scams', 'shady', 'practices', 'now', 'Jasmine', 'finally', 'left', 'Ginger', 'lost', 'money', 'also', 'Ginger', 'moved', 'life', 'two', 'younger', 'boys', 'Jasmine', 'just', 'now', 'able', 'move', 'forward', 'trudging', 'along', 'emotional', 'wreckage', 'become', 'reality.She', 'moves', 'sister', 'forcing', 'boyfriend', 'Chili', 'Bobby', 'Cannavale', 'find', 'place', 'live', 'uphill', 'battle', 'will', 'become', 'world', 'relationship', 'Hal', 'blew', 'up', 'Jasmine', 'lost', 'whole', 'identity', 'can', 'not', 'gain', 'footing', 'life', 'not', 'used', 'can', 'not', 'seem', 'live', 'man', 'only', 'vicariously', 'must', 'start', 'working', 'so', 'dentist', 'own', 'set', 'problems.Jasmine', 'very', 'complicated', 'woman', 'had', 'extreme', 'concern', 'empathy', 'pity', 'rooted', 'life', 'get', 'better', 'actually', 'was', 'point', 'where', 'did', 'gain', 'confidence', 'was', 'going', 'get', 'ahead', 'upheaval', 'overwhelming', 'kept', 'running', 'right', 'same', 'times', 'finding', 'feckless', 'issue', 'take', 'advantage', 'other', 'people', 'especially', 'sister', 'man', 'named', 'Dwight', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'who', 'romantic', 'interest', 'only', 'could', 'stop', 'lying', 'being', 'far', 'too', 'expansive', 'truth', 'completely', 'denying', 'anything', 'fully', 'responsible', 'type', 'woman', 'who', 'will', 'challenge', 'tolerance', 'constantly.Narcissistic', 'hedonistic', 'even', 'selfish', 'times', 'Jasmine', 'French', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'liked', 'everyone', 'found', 'so', 'complex', 'emotionally', 'broken', 'wanted', 'shield', 'stop', 'her', 'same', 'time', 'reckless', 'decision', 'making', 'based', 'untruths', 'kept', 'concerning', 'film', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'working', 'character', 'portrayal', 'Jasmine', 'French', 'have', 'doubt', 'will', 'stick', 'quite', 'while']",Blue Jasmine

1658174,A2I7NGKA8LPN89,B00DL47RQ2,Stacy Hackney (formerly customerS),"[1, 3]","I checked this out from the library. I'd placed a hold on it long before Mr. Allen's adult daughter made allegations of child abuse and so when it became available, I wasn't sure if I wanted to watch it. On one hand I've been raised that people are innocent until proven guilty; on the other hand, I read weekly about child sex abuse here and around the world. Just read recently where young Mexican children are kidnapped from their villages by sex slavers. Appalling. What I decided was to look at this film, but because of the allegations, I'd prefer to not request other works by Mr. Allen from the library.  Hopefully the allegations will be cleared up truthfully.The story is sad. A woman who thought she was wealthy comes to find out that not only is she not wealthy but her husband is a lying, cheating con artist. Now she knew that, sort of. She knew but was in denial. She wanted a pretty life and so she pretended to herself and to everyone else that she didn't know. She actually asked him about it and he denied it and she chose to believe him. Cate Blanchett is wonderful as usual and I love Sally Hawkins. I think her character was tolerable because we saw her asking her husband about his faithfulness to her and about allegations of shady business deals and he blew her off, and just flat out lied and she wanted to believe him, and so did. Her character was clearly enough written and understandable. I don't think her sister's character was written clearly enough. There was alot of talk about her not being as good in certain areas as Jasmine and she seemed to accept that and even mentioned it herself, but perhaps she was just hiding her anger. I think she needed to show her anger more clearly, but Sally did a good job with her anyway.All the acting was good. I thought it was not very believable the way Jasmine's new beau found out about her lying: I think the story would've worked better had he discovered her lies post-marriage. I suspect Mr. Allen the writer just didn't want Jasmine to fall on her feet, but I think the story would've worked better if both Jasmine and her beau were revealed to be liars. I felt sorry for Jasmine but I wasn't emotionally engaged by her and I didn't understand her sister and their relationship. Had the Sally Hawkins character been jealous or angry I would've understood, but though she was somewhat angry that her sister's husband stole her nest egg she didn't really seem to blame her sister. I would've liked more room in the story for Sally's character. I felt sorry most for Jasmine because her life's setbacks caused her to become mentally unstable and there was no evidence in the story that she'd be getting help with that.The sister's relationship didn't work for me. Also didn't like the structure or what happened in the story. After the sister arrived in San Francisco, the guts of the story, the relationships of the sisters and their new men, was presented in a surface way, they weren't interesting as couples. It was as if Mr. Allen disliked the characters and so didn't present the individuals in their new relationships clearly: as if he didn't want to know them. Or perhaps he disliked them so much he didn't want to show them. This didn't make me dislike them, it made me not understand them. Jasmine was desperate, I understood that, but I didn't understand Sally tumbling into bed with a stranger who complimented her a few times.The two sisters met two guys, they hopped into bed with them knowing nothing about the men as individuals. Perhaps Mr. Allen was trying to show the Sally Hawkins character was so insecure, a few compliments was all it took to seduce her. That's probably what he was trying to show, but I wish he'd have done it earlier, and differently, so that I understood her better before she cheated on her boyfriend.I also disliked the story's build up: after Jasmine lied to her new beau I just kept waiting for him to be revealed as a con artist too. I didn't care for the second act or the setup and conclusion of the second act.This almost reminds me of Mr. Allen's Match Point (which I don't really remember very well). I think the two leads in Match Point were unsympathetic characters but I think they were more sympathetic than Jasmine and her sister.Overall I'd say it's kind of hard to like characters if the writer doesn't like them. Jasmine was more sympathetic to me, mostly because she became mentally unstable and with no one to help her. Her sister was not well written.",2,didn't particularly like it (SPOILERS)...,1392768000,"02 19, 2014",2014,4492,"['checked', 'out', 'library', ""'d"", 'placed', 'hold', 'long', 'Mr.', 'Allen', 'adult', 'daughter', 'made', 'allegations', 'child', 'abuse', 'so', 'when', 'became', 'available', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'wanted', 'watch', 'one', 'hand', ""'ve"", 'been', 'raised', 'people', 'are', 'innocent', 'proven', 'guilty', 'other', 'hand', 'read', 'weekly', 'child', 'sex', 'abuse', 'here', 'world', 'Just', 'read', 'recently', 'where', 'young', 'Mexican', 'children', 'are', 'kidnapped', 'villages', 'sex', 'slavers', 'Appalling', 'What', 'decided', 'was', 'look', 'film', 'allegations', ""'d"", 'prefer', 'not', 'request', 'other', 'works', 'Mr.', 'Allen', 'library', 'Hopefully', 'allegations', 'will', 'be', 'cleared', 'up', 'truthfully.The', 'story', 'sad', 'woman', 'who', 'thought', 'was', 'wealthy', 'find', 'out', 'not', 'only', 'not', 'wealthy', 'husband', 'lying', 'cheating', 'con', 'artist', 'Now', 'knew', 'sort', 'knew', 'was', 'denial', 'wanted', 'pretty', 'life', 'so', 'pretended', 'herself', 'everyone', 'else', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'actually', 'asked', 'denied', 'chose', 'believe', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'wonderful', 'usual', 'love', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'think', 'character', 'was', 'tolerable', 'saw', 'asking', 'husband', 'faithfulness', 'allegations', 'shady', 'business', 'deals', 'blew', 'off', 'just', 'flat', 'out', 'lied', 'wanted', 'believe', 'so', 'did', 'character', 'was', 'clearly', 'enough', 'written', 'understandable', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'sister', 'character', 'was', 'written', 'clearly', 'enough', 'was', 'alot', 'talk', 'not', 'being', 'good', 'certain', 'areas', 'Jasmine', 'seemed', 'accept', 'even', 'mentioned', 'perhaps', 'was', 'just', 'hiding', 'anger', 'think', 'needed', 'show', 'anger', 'more', 'clearly', 'Sally', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'anyway.All', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'thought', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'believable', 'way', 'Jasmine', 'new', 'beau', 'found', 'out', 'lying', 'think', 'story', 'would', ""'ve"", 'worked', 'better', 'had', 'discovered', 'post-marriage', 'suspect', 'Mr.', 'Allen', 'writer', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'Jasmine', 'fall', 'feet', 'think', 'story', 'would', ""'ve"", 'worked', 'better', 'Jasmine', 'beau', 'were', 'revealed', 'be', 'liars', 'felt', 'sorry', 'Jasmine', 'was', ""n't"", 'emotionally', 'engaged', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'sister', 'relationship', 'Had', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'character', 'been', 'jealous', 'angry', 'would', ""'ve"", 'understood', 'was', 'somewhat', 'angry', 'sister', 'husband', 'stole', 'nest', 'egg', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'blame', 'sister', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'more', 'room', 'story', 'Sally', 'character', 'felt', 'sorry', 'most', 'Jasmine', 'life', 'setbacks', 'caused', 'become', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'was', 'evidence', 'story', ""'d"", 'be', 'getting', 'help', 'that.The', 'sister', 'relationship', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'Also', 'did', ""n't"", 'structure', 'what', 'happened', 'story', 'sister', 'arrived', 'San', 'Francisco', 'guts', 'story', 'relationships', 'sisters', 'new', 'men', 'was', 'presented', 'surface', 'way', 'were', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'couples', 'was', 'Mr.', 'Allen', 'disliked', 'characters', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'present', 'individuals', 'new', 'relationships', 'clearly', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'perhaps', 'disliked', 'so', 'much', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'dislike', 'made', 'not', 'understand', 'Jasmine', 'was', 'desperate', 'understood', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Sally', 'tumbling', 'bed', 'stranger', 'who', 'complimented', 'few', 'times.The', 'two', 'sisters', 'met', 'two', 'guys', 'hopped', 'bed', 'knowing', 'nothing', 'men', 'individuals', 'Perhaps', 'Mr.', 'Allen', 'was', 'trying', 'show', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'character', 'was', 'so', 'insecure', 'few', 'compliments', 'was', 'took', 'seduce', 'probably', 'what', 'was', 'trying', 'show', 'wish', ""'d"", 'have', 'done', 'earlier', 'differently', 'understood', 'better', 'cheated', 'boyfriend.I', 'also', 'disliked', 'story', 'build', 'Jasmine', 'lied', 'new', 'beau', 'just', 'kept', 'waiting', 'be', 'revealed', 'con', 'artist', 'too', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'second', 'act', 'setup', 'conclusion', 'second', 'act.This', 'almost', 'Mr.', 'Allen', 'Match', 'Point', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'remember', 'very', 'well', 'think', 'two', 'leads', 'Match', 'Point', 'were', 'unsympathetic', 'characters', 'think', 'were', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'Jasmine', 'sister.Overall', ""'d"", 'say', 'kind', 'hard', 'like', 'characters', 'writer', ""n't"", 'like', 'Jasmine', 'was', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'mostly', 'became', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'one', 'help', 'sister', 'was', 'not', 'well', 'written']",Blue Jasmine
1658175,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B00DL47RQ2,Stephanie De Pue,"[3, 6]","BLUE JASMINE, (2013).  In this 98-minute comedy/drama from writer/director Woody Allen, (Manhattan,Hannah and Her Sisters), the high life ends with a bang, leading to high anxiety, for a fashionable New York City socialite as a crisis in her life forces her to undertake a more modest lifestyle in San Francisco. An ensemble all-star cast includes widely-praised and Oscar tipped Cate Blanchett, (an Oscar winner forThe Aviator,Elizabeth), as Jasmine; the title character; and a restrained Alec Baldwin,(It's Complicated), as her financier husband Hal.Alec's multi-million, fraudulent empire, based upon a Ponzi scheme, collapses and he is sent to prison, in an eventuality thought by many to echo the story of Mr. and Mrs. Bernie Madoff.  Jasmine is left with nothing but some designer duds and luggage.  Yet she flies first class to San Francisco, to take up residence in the cramped South of Mission apartment of her adopted sister Ginger, played by the young, greatly praised Sally Hawkins, (Happy-Go-Lucky). (Both girls had been adopted by the family that took them in). Jasmine is in deep denial of what has happened to her, and is soon seen, if she hadn't been before, in her more rewarding life, abusing vodka and prescription drugs.  With no training whatsoever in the field, she claims to be an interior decorator, and catches the eye of Dwight, a wealthy young diplomat, played by Peter Sarsgaard, (In the Electric Mist).  A cleaned-up Andrew Dice Clay plays Augie, Ginger's ex-husband, bitter because Alec and Jasmine cheated him and Ginger out of their $200,000 lottery winnings. Bobby Cannavale plays Ginger's working class boyfriend.  Louis C.K. plays Al, Jasmine's idea of a more suitable boyfriend for her sister.  The moody, flavorful cinematography is by Javier Aguirresarabe; production design by the adept Santo Loquasto.The beauteous and greatly present Blanchett certainly dominates and carries the film, and it is her performance filling the seats at one of its maker's more commercially successful recent movies.  But the picture does have its notable flaws.  It hints, as do his recent films, that its maker Allen doesn't very often leave the elegant haunts of the super-rich.  Last time I was in San Francisco, the South of Mission area (SoMa) was considered gentrifying rapidly, as the young and adventurous, and artistic types moved in.  Ginger's funky apartment looked fun to me, though it is undoubtedly cramped with two boisterous boys and the sour Jasmine.  Jasmine runs into Augie in Union Square, one of SF's toniest shopping areas, but director Allen has Clay looking, sounding, and eating like a Bronx-based janitor.  The smooth Alec might be transplanted from a boulevardier in an earlier drawing room comedy.Many, many viewers and critics have remarked that the picture seems a riff on ""A Streetcar Named Desire,"" an immortal Pulitzer Prize winning 1947 play written by American playwright Tennessee Williams.  (It was filmed in 1951, under the same name,A Streetcar Named Desire, with an all-star cast headed by Vivien Leigh, Marlon Brando, and Kim Hunter.) And, of course, San Francisco is as well-known for its streetcars as New Orleans, the setting of STREETCAR. Bobby Cannavale's wounded tough-guy resembles  Marlon Brando's Stanley Kowalski .  And, similarly to the Blanche DuBois character in the earlier work, Jasmine is publicly breaking down and coming apart.  She says, ""Anxiety, nightmares and a nervous breakdown, there's only so many traumas a person can withstand until they take to the streets and start screaming.""  The picture opens with her nonstop haranguing an unfortunate older woman who just happens to be sitting next to her on a plane, and cannot move elsewhere.  Later she harangues nonstop an unfortunate woman who just happens to be sitting next to her on a SF bench.  This woman, however, can and does move elsewhere.  The woman on the plane, after she disembarks, tells her husband about her experience.  She tells him she didn't know what to do in the situation.  And there, you have, to me, the biggest difference between BLUE JASMINE and STREETCAR.  Jasmine is coming apart before them, but nobody knows what to do about it, and nobody does anything.  In STREETCAR, Blanche's sister Stella, most likely legally the only person empowered to do so, gets help for her: she is taken to an asylum by a doctor, who appears, memorably, to be kind.  His kindness prompts Blanche's most famous line, ""I have always relied on the kindness of strangers."" In BLUE JASMINE, filmed more than 60 years later, only Jasmine's sister Ginger would legally be able to help her, but the thought never seems to cross her mind.  And for all we know, Jasmin might be in danger of committing suicide.

One of those films where he manages to withdraw his own personality to a distance, where there's no character obviously speaking the ""Woody"" part.  That part's been done over the years with varying results by Kenneth Branagh, Will Ferrell, Larry David, and others.  But when he vanishes all together, when there's just his characters, speaking in all their poignant screwed-up humanity, who needs the nebbish wise-cracking about how meaningless life is?Some of the critics seem to see this movie as a scathing indictment of capitalism in general, Wall St in particular, an unbridgeable gap separating its tony, well-to-do characters and its scruffy middle class ones.  What it actually is about is the perils of living a life based on pretense and deception, where the only ones who claim happiness in the end are those comfortable in their own skin, no matter how modest their means.  Cate Blanchett is by turns, heart-breaking and appalling in her narcissistic ravings. Equally memorable in a very different part is Sally Hawkins, the sister whose world Jasmine descends into, bringing the sort of moral and comedic chaos we've come to expect from the master.  (Woody previously used her to great effect in a small part inCassandra's Dream).I feared going in, having read that this was among Woody's darker visions, that there would be little to like in its characters, that their own self-absorption would keep the audience at arm's length.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  It is in his darker works .Cassandra's Dream,Match Point,Crimes and Misdemeanors) that he crafts his most endearing and enduring characters.

Many of these are of the film itself (going back to last summer. So, I won't spend your time rehashing the film but will concentrate on the DVD version and hopefully add some new info.This is Allen's paean to Tennessee Williams ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" and Australian actress Cate Blanchett is the centerpiece. Alec Baldwin plays her ex-husband who is not unlike the Bernie Madoff-type character that Leo DiCaprio plays in ""Wolf of Wall Street"". Though two comedians (Andrew Dice Clay and Louis C.K.) have large supporting roles, Allen doesn't use their comedic ""talents"" (questionable IMHO for Clay) and, honestly there is not one ""funny"" movement in the 98 minute film. But Allen doesn't always do ""funny"" and that's fine with me.There are two ""bonus features"" on the DVD (I watched the DVD, not the BD), both recorded at the film's ""press conference"". First we have a five-minute ""Notes from the Red Carpet"" showing comments from three of the actors (Blanchett, Clay and Peter Sarsgaard - the latter shows up late in the film) with clips from the film inserted.  Then we have the full 24-minute ""press conference"" with these three actors. We learn that, except for Blanchett, the actors were only given the script for sections that they appear in (an Allen standard practice), and so they couldn't react to the whole story.AS he (almost) always has, Allen uses great 1920s music as his soundtrack. This time - in addition to jazz, we have some great female blues singers.This is not my favorite Allen film (Will anything ever beat ""Annie Hall""?) but it was certainly worth watching.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",5,"Review of the DVD - with notes on the ""Bonus Features""",1391040000,"01 30, 2014",2014,1780,"[""'m"", 'even', 'posting', 'review', 'newest', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'film', 'are', '272', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'Many', 'are', 'film', 'going', 'back', 'last', 'summer', 'So', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spend', 'time', 'rehashing', 'film', 'will', 'concentrate', 'DVD', 'version', 'hopefully', 'add', 'new', 'info.This', 'Allen', 'paean', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'A', 'Streetcar', 'Named', 'Desire', 'Australian', 'actress', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'centerpiece', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'ex-husband', 'who', 'not', 'Bernie', 'Madoff-type', 'character', 'Leo', 'DiCaprio', 'Wolf', 'Wall', 'Street', 'two', 'comedians', 'Andrew', 'Dice', 'Clay', 'Louis', 'C.K', 'have', 'large', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Allen', ""n't"", 'use', 'comedic', 'talents', 'questionable', 'IMHO', 'Clay', 'honestly', 'not', 'one', 'funny', 'movement', '98', 'minute', 'film', 'Allen', ""n't"", 'always', 'do', 'funny', 'fine', 'are', 'two', 'bonus', 'features', 'DVD', 'watched', 'DVD', 'not', 'BD', 'recorded', 'film', 'press', 'conference', 'First', 'have', 'five-minute', 'Notes', 'Red', 'Carpet', 'showing', 'comments', 'three', 'actors', 'Blanchett', 'Clay', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'latter', 'up', 'late', 'film', 'clips', 'film', 'inserted', 'Then', 'have', 'full', '24-minute', 'press', 'conference', 'three', 'actors', 'learn', 'Blanchett', 'actors', 'were', 'only', 'given', 'script', 'sections', 'appear', 'Allen', 'standard', 'practice', 'so', 'could', ""n't"", 'react', 'whole', 'story.AS', 'almost', 'always', 'Allen', 'great', '1920s', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'time', 'addition', 'jazz', 'have', 'great', 'female', 'blues', 'singers.This', 'not', 'favorite', 'Allen', 'film', 'Will', 'anything', 'ever', 'beat', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'was', 'certainly', 'worth', 'watching.I', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",Blue Jasmine

Does she disintegrate further? What happens to Jasmin? Watch and find out.I knew a person like this . . . family like this. All too real. While I would say it is probably more common than not I wonder how much of this was  influence by Tennessee Williams' A Street Car Named Desire? Very similar plot and characters. But then again like I said the personality is pretty common. The Hollywood fictional aspect to this movie is SF. You cannot bag groceries and live in a spacious apartment in SF with two kids. Sorry. Also how many straight people are there in SF in actuality living out normal like lives? It is definitely a minority. Nice idea that SF is the SF of the early 70s and before. But it really isn't. Even where straights exist it is the upper class that you would not interact with or the single workaholics (out of necessity to live in SF) that are involved in normal life as most people know it and as is portrayed in NY. Not to beat the proverbial dead horse but if you sat down beside someone in SF that was talking to himself you wouldn't get creeped out and stare. It is to be expected. Same if you were walking down the street and saw someone doing that . . . you wouldn't stop and stare. That is SF . . . and you would know it unless you were a tourist, even then I think its rep precedes it. Sorry it is true f rom my experience living there, having friends there, spending a lot of time there. It is the city. Also the interview with the cast extras shows that people are making a bigger deal out of this movie than it deserves. I guess it is their industry trying to maintain the atmosphere to stay employed.

This has been the case since his highly Ingmar Bergman-esque ""Interiors"" in 1978.  This time it's John Cassavetes's ""A Woman Under the Influence"" (1974) under the further influence of ""A Streetcar Named Desire.""  It's a bit unsettling how reminiscent of Gena Rowlands's Academy Award-nominated portrayal of a woman headed toward emotional breakdown Cate Blanchett's performance (also Oscar-nominated and a likely winner) is here.  The brief Peter Sarsgaard part feels a tad too conveniently plot-driven.  (Sarsgaard himself, in a DVD-extra interview, couldn't help but allude to the absurdity of his role.)  However, this is one of a small percentage of films in which the multiple-flashback structure is consistently effective (as opposed to confusing and/or pretentious) in probing the psychological state of its main character.  As in all high-quality Woody Allen dramas, the dialogue is right on the money (almost literally in this case, as the effects of a hypermaterialistic lifestyle are a theme here), the actors are at their best, scenes are superbly framed and shot, the editing is seamless, and of course there's the old-timey music (which, although enjoyable, I didn't think had anything to do with the substance of this film).When Cate Blanchett picks up her Oscar March 2, it would be nice if she mentioned Gena Rowlands, who had to have been an ""influence.""",4,an involving character study under the influence,1392163200,"02 12, 2014",2014,1565,"['Woody', 'Allen', 'most', 'involving', 'film', 'Hitchcockian', 'Match', 'Point', '2005', 'not', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'so', 'many', 'dramatic', 'laugh-free', 'films', 'derivative', 'been', 'case', 'highly', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman-esque', 'Interiors', '1978', 'time', 'John', 'Cassavetes', 'A', 'Woman', 'Influence', '1974', 'further', 'influence', 'A', 'Streetcar', 'Named', 'Desire', 'bit', 'unsettling', 'how', 'reminiscent', 'Gena', 'Rowlands', 'Academy', 'Award-nominated', 'portrayal', 'woman', 'headed', 'emotional', 'breakdown', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'performance', 'also', 'Oscar-nominated', 'likely', 'winner', 'here', 'brief', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'part', 'tad', 'too', 'conveniently', 'plot-driven', 'Sarsgaard', 'DVD-extra', 'interview', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'allude', 'absurdity', 'role', 'However', 'one', 'small', 'percentage', 'films', 'multiple-flashback', 'structure', 'consistently', 'effective', 'opposed', 'confusing', 'and/or', 'pretentious', 'probing', 'psychological', 'state', 'main', 'character', 'high-quality', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'dramas', 'dialogue', 'right', 'money', 'almost', 'literally', 'case', 'effects', 'hypermaterialistic', 'lifestyle', 'are', 'theme', 'here', 'actors', 'are', 'best', 'scenes', 'are', 'superbly', 'framed', 'shot', 'editing', 'seamless', 'course', 'old-timey', 'music', 'enjoyable', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'had', 'anything', 'do', 'substance', 'film', '.When', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'up', 'Oscar', 'March', '2', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'mentioned', 'Gena', 'Rowlands', 'who', 'had', 'have', 'been', 'influence']",Blue Jasmine

1658199,A3VAXB8CDYY5BG,B00DL47RQ2,The Wingchair Critic,"[11, 17]","On the basis of characters like Annie in 'Annie Hall' (1977), Eve in 'Interiors' (1978), Cecelia in 'The Purple Rose of Cairo' (1985), Helen Sinclair in 'Bullets Over Broadway' (1994) and Maria Elena in 'Vicki Cristina Barcelona,' among others, Woody Allen has acquired an international reputation as a writer of great cinematic roles for women.But while it is true that Allen has created many interesting, imaginative parts for actresses over the decades, it is also true that Allen has written at least as many bad roles for women as good.Other roles, such Jill in 'Manhattan' (1979), Dorrie in 'Stardust Memories' (1980), Hannah in 'Hannah & Her Sisters' (1986) or Angela in 'Cassandra's Dream' (2007), are actually little more than sketches brought to three-dimensional life by Meryl Streep, Charlotte Rampling, Mia Farrow, and Hayley Atwell, the actresses who essayed the roles, and by Allen's considerable talent as a director.Inexplicably overpraised by American critics, and despite its ninety-eight minute running time, 'Blue Jasmine' (2013) is a flat, boney melodrama that seems like less than half of a fully realized film, as if everything substantial and meaningful about it has been perversely excised.Awkwardly combining aspects of the recent Bernie Madoff financial scandal with plot elements of Tennessee Williams' 'A Streetcar Named Desire' (1947), the previous Allen film it most resembles, especially in tone, is 'September' (1987), the sour, little-seen drama which represented Allen's first creative and commercial failure and also precipitated his long 1990s decline. Perhaps not coincidentally, 'September' also drew directly from life, clumsily reconfiguring as it did the Lana Turner-Johnny Stompanato-Cheryl Crane murder scandal of 1958.Did Allen consciously fit the 'Blue Jasmine' screenplay with the basic outline of one of the 20th century's most famous and groundbreaking plays? It is worth remembering that in 1973's hit comedy 'Sleeper,' which Allen wrote with Marshall Brickman, Allen's character, Miles Monroe, after being brainwashed by fascistic government forces, briefly believes himself to be Blanche DuBois, allowing Allen to perform a hilarious parody of the character. Either way, the 'Streetcar' plot elements and structure are present in the current film: a traumatized, mentally unstable, and guilt-ridden woman in early middle age flees from a sordid past to her sister's economically and socially lower class home, where, instead of finding comfort, she is immediately confronted by brutal realities which threaten to strip away the last of her remaining illusions, and loses a new romantic interest in the process.Most of the scenes are short and perfunctory, almost boilerplate, and completely lacking in depth or imagination. Several scenes threaten to take on a life of their own and become fluid, organic, and compelling, but unfortunately come to an abrupt halt. Some scenes, such as those in which Jasmine is wooed and then sexually accosted by her dentist employer, seem like intentional parodies. A mid-movie subplot involving an audio engineer is nothing but padding and misdirection. Lines of dialog and entire scenes have been lifted from previous Allen screenplays.Though the film is a drama, it is undramatic, and plays as if Allen purposefully wanted the final result to be as flat, banal and minimalist as possible. There is none of the emotional power, catharsis or suspense found in earlier Allen dramas like the visionary 'Interiors,' 'Match Point' (2005), or 'Cassandra's Dream,' imperfect films all, but films which nonetheless predominantly work as good cinema.Cate Blanchett, cast against type given the continuous awkward stumbling required of the character, provides an adequate performance in the shallow role of Jasmine, a character who has none of the emotional resonance or romanticism of Williams' Blanche DuBois. Since Jasmine is depicted as predominantly superficial, snobbish and materialistic before her fall from grace, there is no particular reason for the viewer to find meaning in her collapse, as Jasmine stumbles around San Francisco being deflated by one negative brush with reality after another.Is Jasmine Francis a 'great role for women'? The script makes the major mistake of downplaying anything inherently good in or interesting about Jasmine, such as her early interest in anthropology, or her relationship with her stepson. Though Jasmine reacts volcanically when she learns her husband, Hal, is carrying on sexual and romantic relationships with other women, this is the only aspect of Jasmine's presumed love for Hal on view at any time. Does Jasmine genuinely love Hal or simply view him as another acquisition, as the promising result of her own shrewd social maneuvering?The role explores no facet of Jasmine's psyche specifically, and Allen has examined mental illness, and mental illness in women, far better in 'Interiors,' 'Stardust Memories,' and 'Vicki Cristina Barcelona,' just as he has said more about human frailty and the need for comforting illusions via the character of Helena in the underappreciated 'You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger' (2010).The secondary characters, including Hal (Alec Baldwin), Jasmine's sister, Ginger (Sally Hawkins), Stanley Kowalski stand-in Chili (Bobby Cannavale), Augie (Andrew Dice Clay) and Dwight (Peter Sarsgaard) are either thin stereotypes or present merely as plot devices, though Baldwin, and particularly Clay, make the most of their brief roles.The film, apparently by intent, makes little use of its San Francisco locations, and the city's hazy sunlight also works completely against it, giving the preponderance of the California scenes an ugly ochre cast, one entirely different from the warm Mediterranean tones of 'Vicki Cristina Barcelona,' even though the same cinematographer, Javier Aguirresarobe, worked on both filmsAllen, a great American artist, has been on an impressive artistic roll since 2005's 'Match Point,' and thus can easily be forgiven the overt creative failure of 'Blue Jasmine.' Allen's previous film, 'To Rome with Love' (2012), was also a creative failure, but one which at least enjoyed a few bright moments and offered audiences another example of Darius Khondji's gorgeous cinematography. 'Blue Jasmine,' however, is meandering, pointless, and baldly depressing in its inability to say or do anything insightful with its plot, subject, or theme.",2,'Night-Blooming Jasmine' at Low

That his audience should attach tragic meaning to Blanche DuBois's pitiful fate, Williams creates characters who embody the strengths of their social strata, and he gives them all moments of searing insight.  BLUE JASMINE does not lament the demise of cultivation and gentility; it does not explore the perils of naivete.  Instead, it exposes in ruthless caricature the means by which a beautiful and brainless alcoholic destroys, nearly destroys, or tries to destroy, those closest to her, and thus herself, in relentless pursuit of her next drink.  Allen's narrative treads the long dull path from an ingenue's bumptious inebriety to a widow's exhausted delirium.  Allen's script and cinematography paint such a bleak portrait of rich and poor, young and old, male and female, that BLUE JASMINE might be described aptly as a biting farce.

1658211,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00DL47RQ2,Turfseer,"[12, 19]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Rating: 3.5 out of 5.0With 'Blue Jasmine', Woody Allen has managed to come up with a film that invites comparisons with one great work from theatrical history as well as a more recent true-life story, ripped from the headlines involving the financial world. He cleverly merges these two disparate stories into a fairly gripping tale that will keep your interest to the end, but eschews the complex references from his source material, which make those narratives, much more compelling.Jasmine, Allen's anti-heroine, is obviously based on Ruth Madoff, who was married to Bernie Madoff, who committed the greatest Ponzi scheme in history. In the film, the Madoff character is 'Hal' (Alec Baldwin), a mega-rich investment counselor who ends up being arrested and kills himself while in prison (in real life, of course, it's Ruth's eldest son, who ends up committing suicide). Jasmine moves to San Francisco, moving in with her working class sister, which invites comparisons with Ruth, who moved in with her sister for a while, down in Florida. In the film, Jasmine has one son, who ends up moving to California, who she's estranged from. The real-life Ruth was estranged from her two sons but eventually, I believe, reconciled.'Blue Jasmine' jumps back and forth in time, as the seemingly tragic tale of Jasmine unfolds. When she moves in with her sister, it becomes obvious that Woody Allen is developing his story by taking a page from the Tennessee Williams play book. Jasmine, bearing a striking resemblance to Blanche Dubois from 'Streetcar named Desire', is now caught up in a love triangle involving her sister Ginger, and her new working class lover, Chilli (played by Bobby Cannavale), who also appears to be Woody's version of 'Stanley Kowalski'. While I loved Cannavale in 'Boardwalk Empire', and think he's a great character actor, 'Chilli' is not as complex a character as Williams' Stanley Kowalski. Cannavale's character (along with some of the other characters including Ginger's ex, played by Andrew Dice Clay) seem more like they belong in 'The Sopranos' or 'The Jersey Shore', than denizens of San Francisco.As the story moves along, Jasmine continues to maintain the illusion that she's important and seeks to restore her social status, which was ripped from her, following her husband's arrest. Woody Allen wants us to feel some sympathy for Jasmine after her employer, a dentist, sexually harasses her. Jasmine's initial plan is to take an online course to become computer literate and later become an interior designer (isn't it more likely that she could find a tutor to help her with computer skills?).Finally, Jasmine realizes that her salvation is in finding another rich man to assist her in maintaining her past lifestyle. The way she handles her romance with Dwight (Peter Sarsgaard), a State Department employee, who has aspirations to become a Congressman, is indicative of her ongoing delusional frame of mind: of course she'll be eventually found out, if Dwight runs for office! But so determined to return to the good graces of the nouveau riche, she'll ignore the obvious fact, that there's no chance in hell of her ever escaping the watchful eye of the media (I doubt in real life that Ruth Madoff would have been so delusional, that she would entertain the thought of marrying herself off to an aspiring politician and actually believe that she could then escape discovery of her sordid past).The high point of Woody Allen's plot work comes when Dwight finds out about Jasmine's subterfuge. I was expecting Chilli to spill the beans (no pun intended), but it's actually Andrew Dice Clay's character, Augie, Ginger's ex, who happens to run in to Dwight and Jasmine by chance on the street, and pours out bitter feelings of being betrayed, both by Jasmine and Hal.There's also a sub-plot that moves quite nicely, involving Ginger having an affair with a kindly audio engineer, Al. Chilli blames Jasmine for causing Ginger to regard him as a low life but in a nice plot reversal, Al turns out to have been cheating on Ginger all along. Did Chilli get to Al's wife and let him know what was going on? Or did the wife, simply figure things out on her own?In the end, 'Blue Jasmine' is a derivative tale that manages to entertain. Cate Blanchett, who reminds me of a middle-aged Lauren Bacall, does well in attempting to remind us of Blanche Dubois, stuck in unrelenting self-illusion. The problem is that Woody Allen doesn't know his 'Blanche Dubois' character personally as Tennessee Williams did. Thus, we 'get' Jasmine's self-illusion act in the first thirty minutes. The character arc remains the same and that's exactly Allen's point: the character never learns and never grows. Perhaps Blanchett's best scene is where she confronts Hal at the end, when she finally accuses him of infidelity. But Jasmine's whole history, feels superficial; Woody conveys the superficiality of Jasmine's lifestyle in a schematic way, not like the complicated fictional character of a Blanche, or a real-life Ruth.While Jasmine's one-note character is one of the film's limitations, Woody Allen does manage to come out on the right side of the film's main ethical question. Should we in the end, view Jasmine as a sympathetic figure? Woody, I believe, says no. After all, Jasmine wasn't planning to marry Dwight because she loved him--she simply wanted to be re-established, in her former world of luxury, and continue to look down on all the 'little people', who she regarded as her social inferiors.As a director who has immersed himself for years in the history of film, Woody Allen continues to churn out decent, 'journeyman' work of late. Don't expect any great poetry or descriptive narrative based on a complex historical world, but this is a director who knows how to cast and work very well with an excellent crew of actors and create a story, which moves quite decently, from A to Z.",3,Blanche Dubois meets Ruth Madoff in this entertaining but derivative chronicle of self-deluded anti-heroine,1375574400,"08 4,

That's basically the plot of this amusing but not particularly original Woody Allen movie. It's entertaining and for once, Woody's presence in this movie is more or less invisible except for his insistence on inserting his signature creaky blues and jazz music, which really has little connection to the characters (except for Jasmine's memory of ""Blue Moon"" - a tune that seems too old for the very modern Jasmine to be so enamoured by).Alec Baldwin is oddly subdued as the Madoff character- he never seems to suffer Jasmine's depth of humiliation and misery even though he lost his fortune as much as she did. There are no scenes of him tearing his hair out or screaming over the loss of his fortune, though the real-life Baldwin is obviously capable of this.  He is, however, really a minor character and the film's main focus is in capturing the range and depth of Jasmine's hysterics and capacity for madness. The film indulges in a kind of sado-maschoistic scheudenfraude in watching her degradation and suffering, though it certainly is entertaining. I get the feeling that Jasmine is a composite of Ruth Madoff and Mia Farrow, two women who were victimized by the men they loved. When Jasmine rats out her husband to the feds after Baldwin dumps her for a teenage au pair, I couldn't help seeing the ghost of Mia ratting out Woody to the police after the Soon-Yi affair.Too bad Woody couldn't have stayed with the Ruth Madoff storyline, which in itself is fascinating enough. Do we really need to see Woody's version of ""A Streetcar Named Desire?"" Taking old Tennesee Williams material and ""updating"" it to the present really doesn't work.  Woody's ""working class"" characters inspired by Williams are so stereotypical, so laughably 1940s and 50s caricatures, that I found it hard to believe any of them really exist in today's world. In my view, Allen can only write about rich people with authority.The film is never boring but is predictable and simplistic.  It's hard to believe that Saargard, as Jasmine's new lover, works for the State department but never, ever, guesses the truth about Jasmine until a chance encounter (all the time they dated, he was never suspicious that she never invited him over to her home?!)The most positive thing to come out of this film is that it gave Cate Blachett an opportunity to showcase her considerable thespian powers, giving her a great ""woman's role"" that is sorely lacking in today's movies. She makes this film look better than it actually is.",4,"Entertaining But Derivative and Dated in Its Portrayal of ""Working Class"" Characters",1404172800,"07 1, 2014",2014,2552,"['Bernie', 'Madoff', 'Widow', 'A', 'Streetcar', 'Named', 'Desire', 'basically', 'plot', 'amusing', 'not', 'particularly', 'original', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'once', 'Woody', 'presence', 'movie', 'more', 'less', 'invisible', 'insistence', 'inserting', 'signature', 'creaky', 'blues', 'jazz', 'music', 'really', 'little', 'connection', 'characters', 'Jasmine', 'memory', 'Blue', 'Moon', 'tune', 'too', 'old', 'very', 'modern', 'Jasmine', 'be', 'so', 'enamoured', '.Alec', 'Baldwin', 'oddly', 'subdued', 'Madoff', 'character-', 'never', 'suffer', 'Jasmine', 'depth', 'humiliation', 'misery', 'even', 'lost', 'fortune', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'are', 'scenes', 'tearing', 'hair', 'screaming', 'loss', 'fortune', 'real-life', 'Baldwin', 'obviously', 'capable', 'however', 'really', 'minor', 'character', 'film', 'main', 'focus', 'capturing', 'range', 'depth', 'Jasmine', 'hysterics', 'capacity', 'madness', 'film', 'indulges', 'kind', 'sado-maschoistic', 'scheudenfraude', 'watching', 'degradation', 'suffering', 'certainly', 'entertaining', 'get', 'feeling', 'Jasmine', 'composite', 'Ruth', 'Madoff', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'two', 'women', 'who', 'were', 'victimized', 'men', 'loved', 'When', 'Jasmine', 'out', 'husband', 'feds', 'Baldwin', 'dumps', 'teenage', 'au', 'pair', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'seeing', 'ghost', 'Mia', 'ratting', 'out', 'Woody', 'police', 'Soon-Yi', 'affair.Too', 'bad', 'Woody', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'stayed', 'Ruth', 'Madoff', 'storyline', 'fascinating', 'enough', 'Do', 'really', 'need', 'see', 'Woody', 'version', 'A', 'Streetcar', 'Named', 'Desire', 'Taking', 'old', 'Tennesee', 'Williams', 'material', 'updating', 'present', 'really', ""n't"", 'work', 'Woody', 'working', 'class', 'characters', 'inspired', 'Williams', 'are', 'so', 'stereotypical', 'so', 'laughably', '1940s', '50s', 'caricatures', 'found', 'hard', 'believe', 'really', 'exist', 'today', 'world', 'view', 'Allen', 'can', 'only', 'write', 'rich', 'people', 'authority.The', 'film', 'never', 'boring', 'predictable', 'simplistic', 'hard', 'believe', 'Saargard', 'Jasmine', 'new', 'lover', 'State', 'department', 'never', 'ever', 'truth', 'Jasmine', 'chance', 'encounter', 'time', 'dated', 'was', 'never', 'suspicious', 'never', 'invited', 'home', 'most', 'positive', 'thing', 'come', 'film', 'gave', 'Cate', 'Blachett', 'opportunity', 'showcase', 'considerable', 'thespian', 'powers', 'giving', 'great', 'woman', 'role', 'sorely', 'lacking', 'today', 'movies', 'film', 'look', 'better', 'actually']",Blue Jasmine

Though the film has comic touches, thematically it is a serious character study centered around a woman named Jasmine, a New York socialite whose life has fallen apart and who has been forced by circumstances to move in with her semi-estranged sister, Ginger, who lives in a walk-up apartment in a working-class part of San Francisco.The film begins with Jasmine (Cate Blanchett) on a plane to San Francisco, talking non-stop to an older woman who happened to have the seat next to her. As the scene goes on, we quickly realize that the poor woman has been inadvertently sucked into the situation and is only waiting for her chance to escape, which finally comes at the baggage check-out. Not everyone in the film will be so lucky, particularly Ginger (Sally Hawkins), her sister in San Francisco whom Jasmine is descending upon to stay with until she can get back on her feet. This, we learn, make take some doing as flashbacks reveal that Jasmine's life has recently taken a nasty downward spiral. Her husband, Hal (Alec Baldwin), was a financier who provided the high New York socialite lifestyle that Jasmine always felt was her due. But then the dream life came apart when Hal was arrested for fraud, convicted and ultimately committed suicide in prison, leaving Jasmine with nothing after the government seized all of their assets. And leaving only Ginger as a haven of refuge, albeit a somewhat reluctant haven as Ginger and her then-husband Augie (Andrew Dice Clay) invested - and lost - all of their money in one of Hal's fraudulent ventures, something that Jasmine steadfastly holds herself blameless for. Also less than thrilled is Ginger's current boyfriend, Chili (Bobby Canavale), who finds Jasmine's sudden arrival interfering with his and Ginger's plans to move in together.In addition to a tight, intricately-woven script, Woody Allen is known for bringing out the best performances in his actors, which is why so many actors will jump at the chance at being in one of his films. And Blue Jasmine is no exception. The cast was well-chosen and the performances resonate, none more so than Cate Blanchett's Jasmine. In a truly Oscar-worthy turn, Blanchett brings out Jasmine's inherent unlikability, the socialite who blocks out anything she doesn't want to know or deal with and regards her own shallow existence as the only one that could possibly have any meaning, while at the same time making us feel sympathy for her in her downfall, not because she earns, let alone deserves it, but simply because she is so utterly blind to the consequences of her own behavior. If there is such a thing as a tragic Greek anti-heroine, Blanchett nails it in this film.Highly, highly recommended.",5,"Brilliant, Allen's best in years, and Cate Blanchett delivers another Oscar-worthy performance",1377302400,"08 24, 2013",2013,2886,"['Woody', 'Allen', 'new', 'film', 'Blue', 'Jasmine', 'definitely', 'best', '2011', 'Midnight', 'Paris', 'arguably', 'best', 'Bullets', 'Broadway', '1994', 'Crimes', 'Misdemeanors', '1989', 'film', 'comic', 'touches', 'thematically', 'serious', 'character', 'study', 'centered', 'woman', 'named', 'Jasmine', 'New', 'York', 'socialite', 'life', 'fallen', 'apart', 'who', 'been', 'forced', 'circumstances', 'move', 'semi-estranged', 'sister', 'Ginger', 'who', 'walk-up', 'apartment', 'working-class', 'part', 'San', 'Francisco.The', 'film', 'Jasmine', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'plane', 'San', 'Francisco', 'talking', 'non-stop', 'older', 'woman', 'who', 'happened', 'have', 'seat', 'next', 'scene', 'quickly', 'realize', 'poor', 'woman', 'been', 'inadvertently', 'sucked', 'situation', 'only', 'waiting', 'chance', 'escape', 'finally', 'baggage', 'check-out', 'Not', 'everyone', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'so', 'lucky', 'particularly', 'Ginger', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'sister', 'San', 'Francisco', 'whom', 'Jasmine', 'descending', 'stay', 'can', 'get', 'back', 'feet', 'learn', 'make', 'take', 'doing', 'flashbacks', 'reveal', 'Jasmine', 'life', 'recently', 'taken', 'nasty', 'downward', 'spiral', 'husband', 'Hal', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'was', 'financier', 'who', 'provided', 'high', 'New', 'York', 'socialite', 'lifestyle', 'Jasmine', 'always', 'felt', 'was', 'due', 'then', 'dream', 'life', 'came', 'apart', 'when', 'Hal', 'was', 'arrested', 'fraud', 'convicted', 'ultimately', 'committed', 'suicide', 'prison', 'leaving', 'Jasmine', 'nothing', 'government', 'seized', 'assets', 'leaving', 'only', 'Ginger', 'haven', 'refuge', 'somewhat', 'reluctant', 'haven', 'Ginger', 'then-husband', 'Augie', 'Andrew', 'Dice', 'Clay', 'invested', 'lost', 'money', 'one', 'Hal', 'fraudulent', 'ventures', 'something', 'Jasmine', 'steadfastly', 'blameless', 'Also', 'less', 'thrilled', 'Ginger', 'current', 'boyfriend', 'Chili', 'Bobby', 'Canavale', 'who', 'Jasmine', 'sudden', 'arrival', 'interfering', 'Ginger', 'plans', 'move', 'together.In', 'addition', 'tight', 'intricately-woven', 'script', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'known', 'bringing', 'out', 'best', 'performances', 'actors', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'actors', 'will', 'jump', 'chance', 'being', 'one', 'films', 'Blue', 'Jasmine', 'exception', 'cast', 'was', 'well-chosen', 'performances', 'resonate', 'none', 'more', 'so', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'Jasmine', 'truly', 'Oscar-worthy', 'turn', 'Blanchett', 'out', 'Jasmine', 'inherent', 'unlikability', 'socialite', 'who', 'out', 'anything', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'deal', 'regards', 'own', 'shallow', 'existence', 'only', 'one', 'could', 'possibly', 'have', 'meaning', 'same', 'time', 'making', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'downfall', 'not', 'let', 'alone', 'simply', 'so', 'utterly', 'blind', 'consequences', 'own', 'behavior', 'such', 'thing', 'tragic', 'Greek', 'anti-heroine', 'Blanchett', 'film.Highly', 'highly', 'recommended']",Blue Jasmine
