930904,A1LBAC84TLIGAX,B000AQ69RM,"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF""","[0, 1]","The original Day of the Dead is one of the best zombie movies I've ever seen (I gave it a 9.5 rating) and I proclaimed it as Romero's best work of any zombie movie he's made. While the film was panned by film critics and didn't do that well in theaters due to the horrible advertising campaign, more than twenty years later it is considered a masterpiece of zombie-horror for its good storyline and great focus on characters and their conflicts, making a truly compelling movie to watch, not to mention the great gore factor. Unfortunately, it was because of the fact Day of the Dead was a flop with critics and moviegoers that the zombie-horror movies died out and lost popularity until 2002 with the release of another zombie-horror classic; Resident Evil who had the same problems as Day of the Dead. Since the release of Resident Evil, zombie-horror has been resurrected and has seen a number of new movies over the last six years. The introduction of the zombie classic 28 Days Later followed by the stellar sequel 28 Weeks Later, the horribly reviewed House of the Dead movies, two more stellar Resident Evil sequels (another one is to be released on DVD in December), Land of the Dead, Diary of the Dead, I Am Legend, Doom, and followed by a few goofball independent zombie movies like I Am Omega, the Day of the Dead remake, and this movie; Day of the Dead 2: Contagium.  Day of the Dead 2: Contagium I believed was an overall passable movie, despite the fact it's a horribly reviewed movie on this site (A grand review average of only 2 stars). But let's get one thing straight, this is in NO WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM RELATED TO THE CLASSIC DAY OF THE DEAD. While the back of the box claims this movie is ""Part prequel, part sequel, and a total gut-ripping, gore-spewing homage to the original!,"" um, I don't think so... This film is only a mediocre zombie flick with a random title from a great zombie movie stamped upon it and then they added a 2 to the title. Honestly, I think George A. Romero should have been involved in the making of this film because it probably would have been much better. Sadly, he wasn't. So, to my friend J-Train I suggest you stay away from this movie because you will probably hate it (By the way, have you seen the Resident Evil movies yet? I'm interested in your opinion if you have.).WHAT IT'S ABOUT: In 1968 at Ravenside Military Installation in Pennsylvania a viral outbreak occurred after a Russian pilot who survived a plane crash was captured and brought back for questioning and the cargo was some mysterious vials containing unknown substance that the pilot came in contact with the substance inside the base and then infects the hospital staff at the base causing the military to destroy the base. One man by the name of Dale DeLuca smuggles out a vial of the substance in a thermos, but is killed. However, the thermos is lost in the brush until it is found nearly forty years later by patients from a psychiatric ward (The Romero Ward to be exact. Get it?) on a trip to the DeLuca River. The thermos is brought back, and is opened in a bathroom releasing the mysterious substance and infecting the patients who were near it when it went off. Now their skin is peeling, they're breaking out in hives, they won't eat, they won't sleep, they don't feel pain and don't bleed much, and they're coughing up blood and a mushy green pudding-like substance from their mouths. Oh, and not to mention they crave flesh. Slowly but surely, depending on their metabolisms they begin to turn into the hungry undead. But they can talk, and for some reason they sometimes eat each other (Wait, that doesn't make sense! Zombies don't talk, and they don't eat each other! What the hell?). So the remaining people who have not fully turned into zombies and are trying to get out from the psychiatric ward.MUSIC: It really isn't that great, it's kind of how I felt about the original's music. A mix between crappy and good, that's how I'd describe it.GORE FACTOR: The original is superior and you can clearly tell that this movie was made on a tight budget or the film makers just blew their budget on lesser aspects of the movie. The gore is decent but the zombie make-up was embarassing (I found the original Dawn of the Dead's zombie make-up to be better). There's a lot of arterial spray and limb-ripping, but it looks a bit cheesy and fake.ACTION: This part of the movie was a mixed bag. I liked the gore but I was left questioning how these people were so horrible at aiming their weapons. Not to mention the fact there is no muzzle flash when they fire their weapons, they just kick when they pretend to shoot. These characters receive a nomination from me as ""Worst Characters Ever Put In A Zombie Flick"" they are unbelievably stupid and have very poor acting skills.ACTING: This part was perhaps the worst part of the movie. The dialogue is bad, I MEAN BAD. The story tries to focus on love, conflicts between characters, drug problems, daddy problems, zombies, and action. The actors play the script out like it was bad soap opera mashed together into a zombie movie for this first 45 minutes of this movie (And to later parts too). It seemed to me as if this movie was trying to be like the original by focusing on dialogue more than zombies and gore, but it clearly didn't work that well. The original Day of the Dead pulled off this technique in a superb and sublime fashion. This ""supposed"" sequel didn't get it right like the original and the plot is riddled with holes and wasted opportunities.OVERALL: The only real reasons I gave this movie a passable rating of 6 was because of the gore and cheesyness of the action and actors. Otherwise it's a crushing disappointment of a sequel that has little in common with its sublime predecessor. I'd recommend you rent this movie only and I would recommend the remake of Day of the Dead more than this movie. Only a rental not a buy. This is one of those zombie movies I will only come back to watch once in awhile.THE GOOD: The gore factor, certain action scenes, and the laughably cheesy parts.THE BAD: The music, the lame story and acting, and the movie is a bit dull.",3,"PASSABLE EFFORT, BUT IT'S NO DAY OF THE DEAD... 6 OUT OF 10",1228176000,"12 2, 2008",2008,6159,"['original', 'Day', 'Dead', 'one', 'best', 'zombie', 'movies',

930907,AE8LL9S715YTE,B000AQ69RM,"Amazon Customer ""fbrobertson2""","[2, 2]","I bought this movie the other day simply because it was cheep.  I watched it this morning and I have mixed feelings about it.  One of the greatest feelings is this, if it had not tried to tag itself to George Romero's Day of the Dead, I would have liked it much better.  That very fact, since it has absolutely no connection to the world of Romero's anyway, it would be an interesting low budget film in and of itself.  Of course it would not have lasted for a week in notice if it had not been for the fact that they the producers wanted to staple themselves to Romero's world.  But they did.  So fussing any more about it is fruitless for it is neither here nor there now.  It is because they used used the name and not the world setting of Romero's, which is an interesting horror world setting, that I knocked several stars off the film.  If it had another name, it would have gotten higher stars and this is why...The story itself is quite intriguing.  I like the setting and I like the characters.  The characters, doctors and mental patients, being contaminated by a several decades old container of a virus (which was strange because the writers/producers made the virus look more like some ""ghost"" than an actual disease, sigh) and everyone turning (depending upon how they get contaminated, whether first generation or second generation of contamination) into some form of a zombie.  Interesting, low budget and quite unepic, but still, I got a kick out of the movie.  Then again, please realize that I like the Italian Zombie series on DVD, so, taste comes and taste goes I guess!

After watching Day of the Dead 2: Contagium (2005) a more applicable statement might have been `Part prequel, part sequel, 100% unadulterated rubbish'...at least in terms of the film trying to be an entry into George Romero's original `Dead' series.  Written and co-directed by Ana Clavell (Creepshow 3), the other director being James Glenn Dudelson (Creepshow 3), who's also listed as the producer, the film features Laurie Baranyay (Intoxicating), Justin Ipock (Grave Situations), and Stephan Wolfert.  Also appearing is Steve Colosi, John Freedom Henry (American Skin 2: Eagles Gathering), Julian Thomas, Samantha Clarke, Joe C. Marino (Hatchetman), and Andreas van Ray...as you can see, for many of the performers this was their first feature, and it shows much of the time.As the movie begins the year is 1968 and we're at a Ravenside, a military installation somewhere in Pennsylvania (interestingly enough there happens to be palm trees in Pennsylvania, something I didn't know.  I did, however, know there were palm trees in L.A., where the film was actually shot).  Anyway, something bad is going down (beside this film), resulting in zombies running around, and the military makes the scene, killing everything on sight.  One man escapes with a thermos containing a whirly, twirly vial, but he gets shot and the thermos is lost in the underbrush.  Fast forward some thirty-seven years and we see a group of schmucks (inmates at an asylum that just happens to be located where the military installation was so many years prior, at least before the army blew it up) and one of them finds the thermos, believing it to be some sort of treasure.  I'm not going to bother going into specifics in terms of the various character (as it's not worth the effort), but as you can guess, one of them manages to open the thermos allowing the vial to fall out.  After doing so it releases these magical, glowing, Tinkerbell spores that attach themselves to a handful of people present at the time.  Subsequently these individuals get sick and start shedding their skin, along with developing oozing scabs.  The symptoms clear up, but guess what?  Those affected are now walking, talking zombies, capable of cognizant thought and also sharing a symbiotic relationship in that what happens to one, happens to all (if one bumps his/her head, the others feel it)...the facility is eventually quarantined as the guy heading up the place seems to know what's going down and decides he wants to see how things play out (scientific curiosity, I suppose), but the stinky brown stuff hits the fan as things get seriously out of hand given the extremely contagious nature of the virus released from the aforementioned whirly, twirly vial...Do you ever watch a film and start thinking about how the money spent in making said film could have been better spent?  This is one of those kinds of movies (they should have just given me the money to fund my Catholic high school girl beach volleyball program).  I think one of the biggest mistakes with this film, besides it being made, was the filmmakers attempts to insinuate the feature within George Romero's `Dead' continuum, especially since it felt apparent to me they had little intent on adhering to much of what those of us familiar with the series have come to learn about the undead in general from Romero's classic films (Romero's name isn't in any of the credits, so I doubt he had anything to do with this stink bomb).  The situations played out in this film were more akin to the Resident Evil films than anything else, at least in my opinion (there's a lot of mutation elements thrown about).  Had they not tried to attach their project to the `Dead' franchise, I think perhaps the film would have played out a little better, but not much.  Normally I try to find at least one positive aspect in a movie but I was hard pressed to do so here, primarily because the story was so, damn boring and the characters strictly two dimensional.  Even the ten minute opening sequence, one that should have been exciting as it featured army men fighting the undead, was completely lifeless (no pun intended) and devoid of any, real fun.  The film then drags along for next hour and ten minutes until the last twenty minutes or so, when some zombie action kicks in (it's during this time things get visceral, but by then I had lost much of my interest by this point).  There were quite a few specifics I despised in terms of this film, some of the main aspects being the following...1. The mental patients in general...I've seen real, live loonies before and the people acting all crazy here seemed just that, regular people trying to act crazy.  Hey, let's walk oddly with weird hairstyles and sit around and rock back and forth with stupid, simpleminded grins on our faces.  Don't we appear crazy?2. Near the middle an affected doctor does an Internet search in terms of learning about the vial, and he does get a response from someone, a civilian, who knows quite a bit.  Later on, after the hospital's been quarantined (and supposedly locked down), the dude with the information just shows up in one of the day rooms so that he can dump a huge, steaming load of exposition in our laps.  How in the hell did this guy even get in?  Also, given what he knows, it seemed completely idiotic that he'd even show up, my point proved once he meets his end.3. There was some gunplay throughout, but never once did I see empty shells being ejected from various weapons or any other indicators that the weapons were actually being fired (smoke, muzzle flashes, etc.) other than the associated sound effects, which were obviously edited in during post production.  This may not seem like a big deal, but when a film bores you stupid, it's not unusual to focus on the trivial flaws more so than if you were truly engaged in the plot.  By the way, I don't think some of the firearms used in the opening sequence existed at that particular period of time, but then I'm no weapons expert.4. Zombies don't talk, at least not in my book.  They make guttural moans, groans, and growls, and they may grunt out the occasional word or two (""Brains!""), but they don't stand around discussing with each other about their situation, trying to fathom the changes they're going through.I'm sure there's more, but that's what I came up with off the top of my noggin.  All in all I thought this a generally worthless experience, one that lacked any respect for the franchise it's trying to leech off of, and worthy of a single star out of five.The picture on this Anchor Bay Entertainment DVD release, presented in widescreen anamorphic (1.85:1), enhanced for 16X9 TVs, looks decent, and the Dolby Digital stereo audio comes through well.  There are some extras including an audio commentary track with writer/co-director Ana Clavell, producer/co-director James Glenn Dudelson, and cinematographer James LeGoy, along with a `making of' featurette and trailers for other Anchor Bay DVD releases like Day of the Dead (1985), All Souls Day (1997), It Waits (2005), The Evil Dead (1981), and Demon Hunter (2005).Cookieman108By the way, the people who made this film are also behind Creepshow 3 (2006) so needless to say my expectations for that film have been lowered significantly after witnessing this abomination.",1,"In the words of Pinhead, ""...your suffering will be legendary...""

You took a genre, ""zombie films,"" and made it worse by your addition. Zombie movies were already bad to begin with, but you've done something new. You've done something so bad in a genre meant to be a B-movie haven that it negates the fact that you made a ""bad movie"" in the genre on some philosophical level so that it falls back into the sphere of ""good movie,"" but then the good/bad movie scale collapses into the middle circle of movie hell-bad, bad movie.

930919,A2BQBLCKJHP65G,B000AQ69RM,"Eric Ericson ""RedSabbath""","[0, 0]","First off, I know I'm gonna get ragged over this review......Okay, today I watched one of the DVD's I bought in a Horror Lot of 6 movies:Day Of The Dead 2:ContagiumNow this is the first time I've seen this flix. The reason issimple, when it first came out I saw the box & surprisedthat it even existed and realized George Romero's name wasn't on it at all. Eventually, I saw the Internet reviews universally panning this movie massively. I kept reading.....it's a prequel/sequel yet neither, Romero had nothing to do with it or endorsed it, and what, the zombies talk?!!? So, I forgot about it until two years later. Now.But maybe it was the low expectations going in, but.....I actually liked this movie!Okay, wait a minute, I can see why so many hated it though.First, yes there is NO real way to have the ""Day Of The Dead""title connected to this. NO WAY! This was either a shame onAnchor Bay or the filmakers to think they could have gotten away with this. Maybe the filmakers are innocent and the distributors are to blame trying to cash in on the success of Romero's films after it was completed. Nope. On the slateboard in the behind-the-scenes, it clearly shows ""Day Of The Dead"", so everybody's to blame on that screw-up. If this was released as just ""Contagium"" I think the reviews would have been alot kinder.Second, there's alot of things in the movie that disobey commonUndead/Zombie rules. Like communication, mental-links, and thatsilly device that infected the original six in it's present day. Butif this was brought in to a movie which had NO ties to Zombie classics like ""Day"" or ""NOTLD"" it would be preceived as original. With the ""Day"" title, it seems blasphemous. In fact with these changes it sort of reminded me of ANOTHER franchise of horror movies....Which is Third, this doesn't rip-off ""Day Of The Dead"" as much as ""RETURN Of The Living Dead""! Now THIS is what the movie should have been a sequel to. The virus speading airbourne, zombies talking, not knowing you're dead already, the military being so involved....did the filmakers just title it wrong? This movie would have been a welcome addition to the ""Return"" family, and probably would have been more well received than it's own Parts 4 or 5. In fact, I would say personally, I enjoyed this better than those two ""Return"" sequels! I might even go as far as saying I enjoyed it more than Romero's own ""Land Of The Dead"", which was released just a few months earlier!But look, the movie is flawed, no doubt. But it's far from being the worst Zombie movie ever made. It ranks medicore, a solid C to be precise. The acting is middle of the road, the gore/effects are middle of the road, and the story's about the same too. But actually, I can't remember I've seen a Zombie movie take place in a mental institution before, so that gets a small thumbs up on that one. But what killed this to so many horror fans is simply it doesn't live up to the legacy of Romero's Dead series, and never should have tried. But I think that if they did the right thing & released it on it's own without connection, we'd all say that it was ""Okay, worth a rental, but not too memorable"" and that's far from what's been said about it today.Overall, I'd say get past the title and give the DVD a spin. Don't expect Romero Gold, or Zombie gold for that matter. If you like the genre in general and have an hour or two to kill, it's worth a watch. It's not the best, but it's not the worse either.

Through some horriblespecial effects and even worse acting (seeing the zombie nurses run around like regular people)they all die. The setting looks nothing like 1968, anoither fast forward laterand a special canister containing a contagent (pun on the stupid title) comes into the asylum again in the form of a twinkling light that seems like something out of a Disney movie!!!

930927,A377RCSSGQ6WZW,B000AQ69RM,"ja6438 ""ja6438""","[3, 9]","I picked up a copy of this simply because of the title, expecting it to be completely crappy, so at least I wasn't too disappointed as I never had high hopes for this movie in the first place.  It's obviously an indie movie, with a very ""camcorder"" type look to it.  It has the quality of a bad TV show more than a motion picture.  But I give it credit for striving to have a creative storyline, despite all the technical limitations (such as godawful digital effects and acting), but being somewhat of an independant filmmaker myself, I have to respect it for what it is.First of all, the name ""Day of the Dead 2"" needs to go.  I don't know why they chose that name, of the three Romero films, to spin off of.  Day of the Dead represented a time period years after the zombie pandemic, where only few humans still remain, while Day of the Dead 2 depicts events supposedly taking place even before Night of the Living Dead.  This movie would actually be more suited as a prequel to Zach Snyder's remake of Dawn of the Dead, rather than a sequel to Day of the Dead.  I suppose they chose Day simply because it was the only of Romero's three original film's that hadn't been touched in with a remake yet (and that was probably the original idea, to remake Day, but Taurus most likely realized that they simply weren't capable of doing so). But as long as you can ignore that little fact, we can move on.Now, I'm not one to immediately reject a movie simply because a new filmmaker is taking up something that a ""classic"" filmmaker had created.  I am very open minded on the subject, and really enjoyed the remake's of both Night and Dawn, even more so than that stinker Land of the Dead that was supposed to be a ""masterpeice"", but instead turned out ot be a very rushed Hollywood-style movie with a list of celebrities and absolutely no creativity.  Even so, I still enjoyed Land much more than Day 2.  But my point is that I sat down and tried to watch Day 2 as if it were actually a legitimate prequel to the series.Now the film does have an original (but ridiculous) angle.  The story in a nutshell is that back in 68 a russian plane crashlanded near a prison, holding a bunch of strange viles, which 30 years later upon being opened, contaminate those in the immediate area with an airborne pathogen.  These ""hosts"" gain a whole bunch of superhuman abilities such as a sort of ""invincibility"", and a telepathic link to each other (whatever one feels, they all feel).  The one that these ""superhumans"" contaminate mutates into some type of giant, pulsating [body] which runs the halls, talking and eating people.  Whomever it kills, rises from death as a classic zombie that we all recognize.  But eventually, some of the ""superhumans"" mutate into some type of space vampire and begin eating everything in site.  In between, we get a week storyline with a bunch of mental patients trying to be emotional, people eating their own puke, and a butt-load of cheesy blood and gore.  Not a Romero film by any means, but an interesting and creative origin to the zombie plague, I must say (even though I prefer that the origin remain anonymous, as it requires viewers to think a little more).  Although there are many better zombie films, there are even more that are worse.

To be perfectly honest this movie isn't half bad for a B horror release, which still doesn't make it good by the way.  The number one thing that ruins DOTD 2 is the title, had they called this movie something else, I betcha everyone thats reviewed this movie wouldn't have been nearly as harsh had they just called it something else.  The acting is in no means good, but I have seen worse, the gore effects are okay, but the blood looks like tomatoe paist, and the guts lok like playdoe.

In this, they just went and threw out the history set up by Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead. Or maybe they were just that stupid and didn't realize that Day of the Dead was part 3 in a trilogy. I wouldn't doubt it if they were that dumb. This movie is evidence of that. Then again it may be just a con to trick us into watching this movie. This doesn't even have much continuity with itself. The opening sequence takes place in 1968 according to the on screen text. In it, a man drops a canister containing the zombie virus. Then we see some more text saying it's now 5 days EARLIER. Then you see someone find the lost canister where the guy dropped it 1968. WTF. Did the canister travel back in time? No, the subsequent scenes obviously take place in the present not in 1968. If you look at the end credits it's divided into 1968 cast, and Today cast. They just screwed up royally in post production, and nobody caught it. But if it takes place in the now, it would place these events after the original Day of the Dead. Like I said Absolutely NO Continuity.  The physics of it all doesn't even stay the same. According to this, if you become a zombie you'll be able to read the minds of other zombies and you'll instantly get pregnant if you're female. The zombies even talk in this one to further pervert the original. Even if they didn't call it Day of the Dead 2, and just made it a stand alone picture; which they should have done. It would still be just plain bad. Not so bad it's good kind of bad, but just bad.

930942,AYZV1PJP6NXPT,B000AQ69RM,"R. Long ""JaminRebel""","[0, 0]","I almost fell asleep in this movie. Far from being scared, I instead got really sleepy. But even though I was sleepy I also have to admit that I found the movie a little disturbing. I think it's disturbing when you really can't tell the medical interns in a mental asylum from the patients. It took me a good twenty minutes into the film to decide just who was a patient and who was on the staff. I will say that the device used to put that virus airborne was truly original. I've seen a lot of zombie movies but never was the plague started in such a manner. The plot of the film though made little to no sense. The mental bond that the sick patients had seemed to come and go from scene to scene. And the one intern doctor somehow held on to his mental faculties long enough to investigate the outbreak. The head doctor of the mental asylum was a joke. He tried to talk in some silly accent. He tried to act important. All in all the acting was atrocious by most involved in the film. There were little subplots that seemingly went nowhere. What became of the pregnant woman's unborn baby. I actually may have fallen asleep to miss that garbage. I know I was making an effort to get through the movie and it was an effort. Also, there was the love affair between the patients. They claim they did not have sex so I guess it was the one doctor who got the girl pregnant. If the girl got pregnant by the doctor then the girl got seriously big FAST. Actually, whoever got the girl pregnant set off a pregnancy that led to the girl ballooning in just a day or so. Finally, as the people got sicker the plot just went straight to hell. Sick zombie people were killing and eating each other. Some of the effects were pretty good. I have definitely seem much, much worse. The peeling skin on the sick people was obviously dried rubber cement or some sort of clear latex. It looked real enough though. The worst part of this movie though is the acting and the story. There is just nothing to pull one into this movie. And the producers of this movie truly did use &#34;Day of the Dead&#34; in the title to try to get George Romero fans to watch it. I too had wondered how this movie was related to the other Day of the Dead movie or movies. Obviously this movie had nothing to do with any other movie. This stinker of a movie is a sole and lonely turd and the only thing worse than this movie would be a part three by the producers of this turd. I realized halfway or so through the movie that I wanted to get rid of the dvd. I'll NEVER, EVER, watch this movie again. I'd have to be very desperate for something to watch to watch this again. Of honorable mention though some of the special effects were pretty good. The meat people looked pretty freaking gross. Some of the zombies saturated with blood all over their heads looked pretty scary. Sometimes though the blood squirting out the back of the head looked less than real. And when zombies were getting shot in the head at the beginning they were falling too quickly.

930943,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000AQ69RM,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Day of the Dead 2: Contagium (Ana Clavell and James Dudelson, 2005)I have to say, I hate giving this movie a bad review. There was so very, very much potential to be had here. Some of the special effects are fantastic (while sitting alongside some that are unbearably cheesy-- often in the same shot). The idea is phenomenal. The movie is very well paced, the script has a few brilliant bits (though far more tarnished ones), and the direction is at least competent most of the time.All that said, this movie does one thing that's absolutely unforgivable (and it's something any fangeek could have warned Clavell, who also wrote the script, about long before they started shooting this movie): it not only screwed around with canon in the present timeframe, it went back and attempted to change canon that's been established for forty years. If you're going to associate your movie with the Romero canon, as it stands, and insist (by considering the movie a sequel to Day of the Dead, rather than reimagining it the way Zack Snyder did with his remake of Dawn) that it's a part of that canon, having the opening scene in your movie set in 1968 with talking fast-zombies is pretty much guaranteed to ensure that the majority of Romero fans aren't going to make it past that first scene. (The movie's rating on IMDB, which sits just above 2/10 as I write this, would seem to bear that out.)All that said, if you can get past this by considering it just another zombie movie that has nothing at all to do with Romero's canon, and if you can quell your inner editor long enough to see the good things in this movie, you'll find that there are good things to be seen. Yes, the acting is terrible (and if you're still running the Romero comparison, it just makes the fact that he got so many good performances out of so many bad actors that much more impressive), but that's to be expected from a basement-budget horror movie made in the past thirty years. And yeah, you really have to wonder what Clavell was thinking with some of the special effects (the little glowing tetrahedrons flying through the air made me choke on my drink more than once). But I've seen horror flicks from far more established directors with far worse gore effects (Stuart Gordon's Dagon sits as the current benchmark in that regard), and the ""ground zero"" zombie effects are a lot of fun; they bring to mind both Return of the Living Dead and The Incredible Melting Man. And those vials? Those are awesome. A lot of time was spent on those, buckos. (And the people wondering where the nine million that went into this film went? It went into those. Guaranteed.) And, really, how hard is it to go wrong with a story that involves an outbreak of zombies in a mental asylum? What's more impressive, though, is that once we make it to the present day, the film really does move along at a surprising clip given that the first forty-five minutes or so of present-day footage contains no gore whatsoever. I've watched a lot of horror flicks recently that have forty-five minutes of initial setup whose pace can be best described as glacial; Clavell and Dudelson work it well. And while the script is mostly bad (and the abilities of most of the actors here don't help it along), there are a random few lines that really do work.All in all, it's not the worst movie I've ever seen. It's not even the worst zombie movie I've ever seen. Its connections did, however, decide on a cheap marketing ploy that has almost certainly caused the film to be received much more harshly than, by rights, it should have been. Before renting, be fully aware that despite its title, this movie has nothing at all to do with Day of the Dead, or any of Romero's other films. *",1,So much wasted potential.,1203033600,"02 15, 2008",2008,3723,"['Day', 'Dead', '2', 'Contagium', 'Ana', 'Clavell', 'James', 'Dudelson', '2005', 'have', 'say', 'hate', 'giving', 'movie', 'bad', 'review', 'was', 'so', 'very', 'very', 'much', 'potential', 'be', 'had', 'here', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'fantastic', 'sitting', 'alongside', 'are', 'unbearably', 'cheesy', 'often', 'same', 'shot', 'idea', 'phenomenal', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'paced', 'script', 'few', 'brilliant', 'bits', 'far', 'more', 'tarnished', 'ones', 'direction', 'least', 'competent', 'most', 'time.All', 'said', 'movie', 'one', 'thing', 'absolutely', 'unforgivable', 'something', 'fangeek', 'could', 'have', 'warned', 'Clavell', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'script', 'about', 'long', 'started', 'shooting', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'screwed', 'canon', 'present', 'timeframe', 'went', 'back', 'attempted', 'change', 'canon', 'been', 'established', 'forty', 'years', ""'re"", 'going', 'associate', 'movie', 'Romero', 'canon', 'insist', 'considering', 'movie', 'sequel', 'Day', 'Dead', 'rather', 'reimagining', 'way', 'Zack', 'Snyder', 'did', 'remake', 'Dawn', 'part', 'canon', 'having', 'opening', 'scene', 'movie', 'set', '1968', 'talking', 'fast-zombies', 'pretty', 'much', 'guaranteed', 'ensure', 'majority', 'Romero', 'fans', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'make', 'first', 'scene', 'movie', 'rating', 'IMDB', 'just', 'above', '2/10', 'write', 'would', 'seem', 'bear', 'out', 'said', 'can', 'get', 'considering', 'just', 'zombie', 'movie', 'nothing', 'do', 'Romero', 'canon', 'can', 'quell', 'inner', 'editor', 'long', 'enough', 'see', 'good', 'things', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'find', 'are', 'good', 'things', 'be', 'seen', 'Yes', 'acting', 'terrible', ""'re"", 'still', 'running', 'Romero', 'comparison', 'just', 'fact', 'got', 'so', 'many', 'good', 'performances', 'so', 'many', 'bad', 'actors', 'much', 'more', 'impressive', 'be', 'expected', 'basement-budget', 'horror', 'movie', 'made', 'past', 'thirty', 'years', 'yeah', 'really', 'have', 'wonder', 'what', 'Clavell', 'was', 'thinking', 'special', 'effects', 'little', 'glowing', 'tetrahedrons', 'flying', 'air', 'made', 'choke', 'drink', 'more', 'once', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'horror', 'flicks', 'far', 'more', 'established', 'directors', 'far', 'worse', 'gore', 'effects', 'Stuart', 'Gordon', 'Dagon', 'current', 'benchmark', 'regard', 'ground', 'zero', 'zombie', 'effects', 'are', 'lot', 'fun', 'bring', 'mind', 'Return', 'Living', 'Dead', 'Incredible', 'Melting', 'Man', 'vials', 'are', 'awesome', 'lot', 'time', 'was', 'spent', 'buckos', 'people', 'wondering', 'where', 'nine', 'million', 'went', 'film', 'went', 'went', 'Guaranteed', 'really', 'how', 'hard', 'go', 'wrong', 'story', 'outbreak', 'zombies', 'mental', 'asylum', 'What', 'more', 'impressive', 'though', 'once', 'make', 'present', 'day', 'film', 'really', 'move', 'along', 'surprising', 'clip', 'given', 'first', 'forty-five', 'minutes', 'so', 'present-day', 'footage', 'gore', 'whatsoever', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'lot', 'horror', 'flicks', 'recently', 'have', 'forty-five', 'minutes', 'initial', 'setup', 'pace', 'can', 'be', 'best', 'described', 'glacial', 'Clavell', 'Dudelson', 'work', 'well', 'script', 'mostly', 'bad', 'abilities', 'most', 'actors', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'help', 'along', 'are', 'random', 'few', 'lines', 'really', 'do', 'work.All', 'not', 'worst', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'not', 'even', 'worst', 'zombie', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'connections', 'did', 'however', 'decide', 'cheap', 'marketing', 'ploy', 'almost', 'certainly', 'caused', 'film', 'be', 'received', 'much', 'more', 'harshly', 'rights', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'renting', 'be', 'fully', 'aware', 'title', 'movie', 'nothing', 'do', 'Day', 'Dead', 'Romero', 'other', 'films', '*']",N/A

930947,A2CT2SA6KFE8GC,B000AQ69RM,"Stanley Runk ""Runkdapunk""","[5, 5]","It's a pretty ballsy move to make a low budget zombie film and call it Day Of The Dead 2.  Expectations will be high based solely on that, and the disappointment will be greater if the movie is mediocre.  And what's with the title anyway?  Why  make a ""sequel"" to a part 3 of a four part series?  It sounds as silly as Making an Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom Part 2.  Romero fans will either be excited to see this or just shake their heads and walk away.  But you can't help but be a bit curious about the film.  After all, it has claimed to be both a sequel and prequel to Day of the Dead.  Hell, even the coverbox art is very close to Day's.  I was one of those who took the plunge, after all I'll take a bad sequel over a remake anyday.  What does this film have to do with Day Of The Dead?  Doodly squat!  I did become kinda angry that someone would just make their own zombie movie and try to pass it off as a direct tie-in to Romero's stuff.  That's rather cheap.  Who knows if maybe in the future someone would actually make a fairly decent sequel to Day?  Now they can't coz  some schmuck has used up the title on their crap!  If the film had just simply used the title Contagium, people may not love it, but would be easier on it.  Plotwise, there's a vial containing the zombie virus found on the grounds of a mental institution(it survived a military raid on a hospital in the 60s).  The vial's opened, the virus infects our four leading characters, and a good portion of the film is their slow transformation.  In the end, zombies have overrun the hospital and mankind looks doomed.  Well, a film claiming to tie in with Day Of The Dead manages to break the rules set forth by Romero.  Zombies talk and have a fairly large degree of intelligence.  They have their memories from their life.  The infected heroes don't get all ugly and decomposed because we're supposed to like them.  The zombies have some sort of collective conscience where they can all hear something that just one zombie hears.  Or one gets shot or slapped, the others experience it.  The slap scene is funny coz all the other zombies' heads snap to the right.  It kind of reminds you of the dancing zombies in the Thriller video.  The FX are actually decent, the acting as good as to be expected, and the story isn't all that bad, it just needed to be it's own movie, coz what we got here is a really low attempt to cash in on Romero's name.",2,Temping?,1139875200,"02 14, 2006",2006,2431,"['pretty', 'ballsy', 'move', 'make', 'low', 'budget', 'zombie', 'film', 'call', 'Day', 'Dead', '2', 'Expectations', 'will', 'be', 'high', 'based', 'solely', 'disappointment', 'will', 'be', 'greater', 'movie', 'mediocre', 'what', 'title', 'anyway', 'Why', 'make', 'sequel', 'part', '3', 'four', 'part', 'series', 'as', 'silly', 'Making', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'Temple', 'Doom', 'Part', '2', 'Romero', 'fans', 'will', 'either', 'be', 'excited', 'see', 'just', 'shake', 'heads', 'walk', 'away', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'bit', 'curious', 'film', 'claimed', 'be', 'sequel', 'prequel', 'Day', 'Dead', 'Hell', 'even', 'coverbox', 'art', 'very', 'close', 'Day', 'was', 'one', 'who', 'took', 'plunge', ""'ll"", 'take', 'bad', 'sequel', 'remake', 'anyday', 'What', 'film', 'have', 'do', 'Day', 'Dead', 'Doodly', 'squat', 'did', 'become', 'kinda', 'angry', 'someone', 'would', 'just', 'make', 'own', 'zombie', 'movie', 'try', 'pass', 'off', 'direct', 'tie-in', 'Romero', 'stuff', 'rather', 'cheap', 'Who', 'maybe', 'future', 'someone', 'would', 'actually', 'make', 'fairly', 'decent', 'sequel', 'Day', 'Now', 'ca', ""n't"", 'coz', 'schmuck', 'used', 'up', 'title', 'crap', 'film', 'had', 'just', 'simply', 'used', 'title', 'Contagium', 'people', 'may', 'not', 'love', 'would', 'be', 'easier', 'Plotwise', 'vial', 'containing', 'zombie', 'virus', 'found', 'grounds', 'mental', 'institution', 'survived', 'military', 'raid', 'hospital', '60s', 'vial', 'opened', 'virus', 'four', 'leading', 'characters', 'good', 'portion', 'film', 'slow', 'transformation', 'end', 'zombies', 'have', 'overrun', 'hospital', 'mankind', 'looks', 'doomed', 'Well', 'film', 'claiming', 'tie', 'Day', 'Dead', 'break', 'rules', 'set', 'forth', 'Romero', 'Zombies', 'talk', 'have', 'fairly', 'large', 'degree', 'intelligence', 'have', 'memories', 'life', 'infected', 'heroes', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'ugly', 'decomposed', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'like', 'zombies', 'have', 'sort', 'collective', 'conscience', 'where', 'can', 'hear', 'something', 'just', 'one', 'zombie', 'one', 'shot', 'slapped', 'others', 'experience', 'slap', 'scene', 'funny', 'coz', 'other', 'zombies', 'heads', 'snap', 'right', 'kind', 'reminds', 'dancing', 'zombies', 'Thriller', 'video', 'FX', 'are', 'actually', 'decent', 'acting', 'as', 'good', 'be', 'expected', 'story', ""n't"", 'bad', 'just', 'needed', 'be', 'own', 'movie', 'coz', 'what', 'got', 'here', 'really', 'low', 'attempt', 'cash', 'Romero', 'name']",N/A

The army moves in and wipes them out. Well some years later the out break is back because now the hospital is now a mental one. The acting is pretty bad and somebody needs to show these people how to act like Zombies. It can not be that hard! Some of the zombies actually talk and seem to become smarter. What is this about.

930949,A36ER94271DHJZ,B000AQ69RM,"stryper ""stryper""","[10, 15]","I just don't get some peoples mind set.Before I buy a DVD of a movie that I'm not familiar with, I like to read as many reviews (professional and otherwise) as I can.But for some reason or another, there just seems to be good films that get bad reviews, and visa/versa, bad films that get glowing reviews.Case in point, ""DEAD MEAT"".Now before I plunked down the rather hefty price of $39.99 (Canadian buckages) I read all of the reviews that I could find, which weren't much, but what I culled from these reviews, seemed to indicate that this was a rather well done little edition to the, ""FLESH EATING, LIVING DEAD"" genre.So, armed with a pretty good trailer, and the glowing reviews (and quite desperate to find a new jewel of a horror flick) I paid the money, and geared up, for what I expected to be a nice little indie film.Well, that's $39.99+ taxes, that I'll never see again.I wouldn't say that the film was terrible, but the bad acting, so-so effects, and silly story line (mad cow, disease ridden zombies, sounds just wacky enough to be cool, but only if handled properly, and sadly, this wasn't) didn't help the movie in anyway.Of course, I should have known better, due to the fact that this was a, ""FANGORIA"" presentation (I still have nightmares concerning their, ""GREAT"" film, ""CHILDERN OF THE GRAVE"", and not in the good sense of the word, but more like the, ""I RENTED THIS PIECE OF CRAP"", sense)Of course, ""FANGORIA"" blind sided me years later with their presentation of an ambitious little film called, ""ETERNAL BLOOD"", which, although not a master piece, was still a nice little Spanish made, vampire film. Hence the reason that I was inclined to believe that, ""DEAD MEAT"", could possibly be a nice little time waster.Now, with, ""DAY OF THE DEAD 2: CONTAGIUM"", the packaging looked neat, the story line sounded like fun, and it was from Anchor Bay, so I thought that this would be a no brainer, where the splatter fans where concerned, so imagine my surprise, when all of the reviews that I read, pretty much called this a piece of crap.I would have passed this title over completely, if not for the fact that a friend said that he was thinking of getting it, saying that a sales person (where he was buying, ""LAND OF THE DEAD"") had recommended it to him.I just figured that the sales person, saw a chance to unload a crappy flick, on an unsuspecting buyer, and read him all of the reviews that I found on amazon.com and DVD Basen, which had us both in stitches, as to how bad this movie, supposedly was.But one reviewer from DVD Basen, though more or less comparing this film to turtle dung, did mention something in his review that sparked my curiosity, enough so, that I went out the very same day, and purchased the movie, just on the chance that they had all been watching, and reviewing, the wrong film.Granted, it took some real soul searching, and discussions with the friend whom I had previously dissuaded from purchasing the movie in the first place, before I was ready to tare off the plastic wrap (thus voiding any chance of a store refund) and pop the disc into the player.And, to my relief and surprise, the film didn't suck, matter of fact, pretty much all of the criticisms that I read about this film, where either not present in this film, or were what made it worth watching in the first place.First off, I believe that most (if not all) of the reviews of this film, could count their age on two hands and a foot, not meaning that they are immature, but that they grew up with the movies of today, where build up of suspense, is limited to the length of the opening credits, and if there's a lull in the action, for, lets say, something as trivial and meaningless as, oh, story and character development, then the film is boring crap to them.Just about every reviewer was hard pressed to relay, just how long and boring, the stretch between the first bit of gore, and the last, was. They also complained about the lousy acting, said the special effects were substandard, and one reviewer even went as far as to say that they felt that the film makers themselves, held the, ""ZOMBIE"" genre itself, in contempt.Well, first off, what this film has going for it is, practical, on set, make-up effects, without the crutching use of CGI (or, ""C Grade Images"", as I like to refer to them). I'd say that the effects rate up there with films like, Re-Animator, and Hellraiser 2.There's one particularly great effect where a security guard is slumped against a door, thinking that he's safe, only to have one of the undead, punch through the door, through him, and come out with his heart, in it's hand. That's the kind of effects that you get here.The acting, is on par with most films of the 80's (which, I believe, is the style that the film makers where going for) in that it's not going to garner anyone an Oscar, but it does the job all the same.And as for this, ""Boring Stretch"", that I kept reading about, apparently my copy of the film had been edited differently, as I couldn't find it, but what I did find, was a stretch of film that actually devoted itself to character development, while still building the plot and suspense of the movie, making the final gorefest, all that more rewarding, as opposed to the ending just being another gorefest, in a long string of gorefests (which most of the newer films seem to think is a good substitute for silly little things like, oh say, plot, story and character development, etc...).And as for the filmmakers supposed contempt of the, ""ZOMBIE"" genre, well, all one has to do is to watch the making of, to dispel this theory, as you can plainly see that these people were having a great time making this film, and seemed to really care about what they where doing.And lastly, the title seemed to be the biggest contention with ALL of the reviewers, and to this I say that you have to be able to put things into perspective, and not only look at it from a marketing point of view, but as the homage to a great film franchise, that it was attempting to be.So, that said, gather all of your gorehound friends together, rent (or buy) this flick, and just sit back and enjoy it for what it is, a nice little homage to 80's ""UNDEAD"" movies.And let the spatter, begin :)",4,I MUST HAVE BEEN WATCHING A DIFFERENT MOVIE...
