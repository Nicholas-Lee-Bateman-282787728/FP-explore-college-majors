It's encouraging seeing them take away things from these movies and apply them in real life situations.  I highly recommend them.,5,Penguins Movie,1358985600,"01 24, 2013",2013,251,"['2.5yr', 'old', '5', 'year', 'old', 'movies', 'like', 'share', 'moral', 'lesson', 'teach', 'God', 'encouraging', 'seeing', 'take', 'away', 'things', 'movies', 'apply', 'real', 'life', 'situations', 'highly', 'recommend']",3-2-1 Penguins: Save the Planets

This DVD has 3 cool episodes on it.""The Green-Eyed Monster""This episode is about envy. Michelle is jealous because Jason's room is a tiny bit bigger than hers. They land on a planet called Picket, where it is divided by a picket fence, and the sheep who inhabit the planet are arguing on who has the greener grass, and even when they switch sides, they still think the other side is greener. Suddenly, a green-eyed monster appears, and begins to eat everything.""More Is More""This episode is about over doing it. Kevin and Jason get addicted to a new cereal called Sugar Frosted Black Holes. They land on a planet called Gutt and it has a strong gravitational field. The people of this planet have become gluttons. And now, a huge space twister threatens to suck the planet into nothing.""Give and Let Give""This is an episode about sharing. Michelle doesn't want to share the cupcakes she made with Jason. She gives everyone one, excluding him.They land on the desert planet of Share-a-Like that is suffering a draught. The flamingos and garden gnomes there are about to rage war over each other about water rights.All 3 of these episodes are fantastic. They're entertaining, hilarious, and teaches you a good lesson. Don't think you're too old for a show like this. I'm 16, and this is one of my top fave shows. I love the imagination, the humor, and the wonderful lessons you learn, which really makes you think and take to heart.

If they begin having an issue related to the teaching in the DVD, one of them will remind the other about what the story said and they will discuss what to do - mind you, these are two little boys under the age of seven!!!

1167744,A2F1L9CN8KS9XH,B001AR0D1I,"R. Scott ""macfanboy""","[6, 6]","We purchased the new DVD, ""3-2-1 Penguins: Save the Planets.""  This is the first new release of 3-2-1 Penguins since Big Idea Productions was acquired by Classic Media.We liked the three episodes that you can play all at once.  It sounds like they got new actors to do the voices of Michelle, and Captain Zidgel.  They follow the same formula as previous episodes with Jason and Michelle praying at their bedside at the end of the day, prompted by the lessons they have learned in their most recent space adventure.  The three new adventures don't have musical epilogs like the previous episodes but we liked them.We have all six previous episodes on DVD and they are all very short.  We have to do a lot of DVD player attendance to play three episodes in a row.  Big Idea needs to re-release the six previous episodes on two separate DVD product releases, three episodes per DVD with a ""Play All"" option on the DVD menu.",5,Three episodes in a row works for me.,1220832000,"09 8, 2008",2008,921,"['purchased', 'new', 'DVD', '3-2-1', 'Penguins', 'Save', 'Planets', 'first', 'new', 'release', '3-2-1', 'Penguins', 'Big', 'Idea', 'Productions', 'was', 'acquired', 'Classic', 'Media.We', 'liked', 'three', 'episodes', 'can', 'play', 'once', 'got', 'new', 'actors', 'do', 'voices', 'Michelle', 'Captain', 'Zidgel', 'follow', 'same', 'formula', 'previous', 'episodes', 'Jason', 'Michelle', 'praying', 'bedside', 'end', 'day', 'prompted', 'lessons', 'have', 'learned', 'most', 'recent', 'space', 'adventure', 'three', 'new', 'adventures', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'musical', 'epilogs', 'previous', 'episodes', 'liked', 'them.We', 'have', 'six', 'previous', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'are', 'very', 'short', 'have', 'do', 'lot', 'DVD', 'player', 'attendance', 'play', 'three', 'episodes', 'row', 'Big', 'Idea', 're-release', 'six', 'previous', 'episodes', 'two', 'separate', 'DVD', 'product', 'releases', 'three', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'Play', 'All', 'option', 'DVD', 'menu']",3-2-1 Penguins: Save the Planets
1167745,AKEZ5LBU48M63,B001AR0D1I,Tenna Merchent,"[11, 11]","This was a good buy. The DVD contains 3 separate episodes, which is new for 3-2-1 Penguins.The first one is ""More is More"" which I loved. The children (Jason and his twin sister Michelle) are interested in a sugary cereal called Sugar Frosted Black Holes, but get called away on a mission with their friends the Penguins. They're called to a planet Gutt because its gravitational field isn't working properly. On the way to the planet, they come across some of the cereal, and Jason and Kevin become addicted. Even though they are full, they want more. Once the penguins arrive at the planet, they see that the leader of the planet has put on a lot of weight compared to his picture on the wall. He has also been eating the sugary cereal. His home is also covered with video games. Michelle comments that it just seems like too much, and she's waiting for a lesson from Saul. Jason figures out that sugar in the cereal is the cause of the gravitational imbalance, and as soon as everyone says ""I've had enough"" balance is restored. It is a great lesson in gluttony, excess, and self-control. I especially liked the fact that a sugary cereal was at the base of all the problems.The next one is ""The Green-Eyed Monster"" which of course is about envy and jealousy. It starts with Michelle being jealous that Jason's room is .05 meters bigger than hers. This is how they normally set up the story, a problem at home for the children gets played out in the Penguins mission. In this case they visit a planet of sheep, and boy does the captain make a fool out of himself when he meets them! ""It's nice to meet ewe. Do you get it E-W-E?"" and of course he just won't drop it. There is a fence dividing the land, and the sheep on both sides think the other side's grass is greener. Even after they switch sides, the still believe the other side is greener. Then a real green eyed monster appears and is destroying everything. Michelle discovers that you have to be grateful for what you have to get rid of the monster.The last one is ""Give and Let Give"" which is the story of yard art fighting over a pond. Pink flamingos and garden gnomes, the message here is sharing.If you're new to 3-2-1 Penguins, they are wonderful. The animation is beautiful, with rich colors, and a three dimensional appearance. The penguins are hysterical, and the messages are meaningful, yet simple enough for a child to understand. Often a Bible verse is used to back up the moral of the story. They are done by the same people who do Veggie Tales, only now everybody has hands.",5,Good investment in money and time,1220486400,"09 4, 2008",2008,2548,"['was', 'good', 'buy', 'DVD', '3', 'separate', 'episodes', 'new', '3-2-1', 'Penguins.The', 'first', 'one', 'More', 'More', 'loved', 'children', 'Jason', 'twin', 'sister', 'Michelle', 'are', 'interested', 'sugary', 'cereal', 'called', 'Sugar', 'Frosted', 'Black', 'Holes', 'get', 'called', 'away', 'mission', 'friends', 'Penguins', ""'re"", 'called', 'planet', 'Gutt', 'gravitational', 'field', ""n't"", 'working', 'properly', 'way', 'planet', 'come', 'cereal', 'Jason', 'Kevin', 'become', 'addicted', 'Even', 'are', 'full', 'want', 'more', 'penguins', 'arrive', 'planet', 'see', 'leader', 'planet', 'put', 'lot', 'weight', 'compared', 'picture', 'wall', 'also', 'been', 'eating', 'sugary', 'cereal', 'home', 'also', 'covered', 'video', 'games', 'Michelle', 'comments', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'waiting', 'lesson', 'Saul', 'Jason', 'out', 'sugar', 'cereal', 'cause', 'gravitational', 'imbalance', 'as', 'soon', 'everyone', ""'ve"", 'had', 'enough', 'balance', 'restored', 'great', 'lesson', 'gluttony', 'excess', 'self-control', 'especially', 'liked', 'fact', 'sugary', 'cereal', 'was', 'base', 'problems.The', 'next', 'one', 'Green-Eyed', 'Monster', 'course', 'envy', 'jealousy', 'Michelle', 'being', 'jealous', 'Jason', 'room', '.05', 'meters', 'bigger', 'hers', 'how', 'normally', 'set', 'up', 'story', 'problem', 'home', 'children', 'played', 'out', 'Penguins', 'mission', 'case', 'visit', 'planet', 'sheep', 'boy', 'captain', 'make', 'fool', 'when', 'nice', 'meet', 'ewe', 'Do', 'get', 'E-W-E', 'course', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'drop', 'fence', 'dividing', 'land', 'sheep', 'sides', 'think', 'other', 'side', 'grass', 'greener', 'Even', 'switch', 'sides', 'still', 'believe', 'other', 'side', 'greener', 'Then', 'real', 'green', 'eyed', 'monster', 'destroying', 'everything', 'Michelle', 'have', 'be', 'grateful', 'what', 'have', 'get', 'rid', 'monster.The', 'last', 'one', 'Give', 'Let', 'Give', 'story', 'yard', 'art', 'fighting', 'pond', 'Pink', 'flamingos', 'garden', 'gnomes', 'message', 'here', 'sharing.If', ""'re"", 'new', '3-2-1', 'Penguins', 'are', 'wonderful', 'animation', 'beautiful', 'rich', 'colors', 'three', 'dimensional', 'appearance', 'penguins', 'are', 'hysterical', 'messages', 'are', 'meaningful', 'yet', 'simple', 'enough', 'child', 'understand', 'Often', 'Bible', 'verse', 'used', 'back', 'up', 'moral', 'story', 'are', 'done', 'same', 'people', 'who', 'do', 'Veggie', 'Tales', 'only', 'now', 'everybody', 'hands']",3-2-1 Penguins: Save the Planets
