1496264,A3VUXYHJGL9WWX,B005OGYH9A,"bass boy ""music fan""","[20, 21]","Wow, I was really surprised at the quality of the Stones' performance and of the film itself. I had heard horror stories about one of the Colorado gigs on this tour from a good friend (guitar player), and how he said Richards was so out of it he couldn't play, and the only musicians musically ""together"" were Watts and Wyman that night. Prior to curtain time, I just knew this would fall so far below ""Ladies and Gentlemen ..."" Well, I have to blaspheme here - I like it as well as that film - actually, the Stones sound even meaner on this 1978 video. They are much, MUCH better in this 1978 flick than their Saturday Night Live performance from that same year (too much coke and booze with Belushi and Akroyd at SNL?) It's interesting to see and hear how punk rock influenced the Stones in this release. Jagger's vocals are strong, barking and lean; Richards' guitar playing is pushy and bold; and Watts gives what is simply his greatest on-screen performance yet on the drums. He hit the drums really, really hard on this tour. There's still his jazz touch, but his right arm is a weapon in this movie. If only there were more screen time for Watts, Wyman and touring keyboardists Ian Stewart and (ex-Faces member) Ian McLagan. You do see them, but I would have liked to have seen them more. This is a great treasure with clear, edgy mix of instruments and voices. Oh yeah, I'll be picking the DVD/CD version of this up.

This 1978 concert in Texas includes Bill Wyman on bass guitar. This is the Rolling Stones without much extra help on stage- no horns. But for a blu ray disc the video quality is unimpressive and you may as well buy the DVD version (if the audio on that one is equally good).Why did the Stones bring this blu ray disc to market when BRIDGES TO BABYLON (with Joshua Redman on saxophone) remains unreleased in blu ray?

1496267,A1IDDAE9L2R73Z,B005OGYH9A,"Crawford ""Swordsman""","[1, 2]","Like other reviewers I attended this same show.  Also I've owned the incomplete half hour bootleg video and a cassette soundboard recording of the complete show for 15 years.  Of the many hours of pirated live Stones video/audio in my collection this is among my favorites.  That's why I eagerly purchased upgraded DVD/CD versions.  The reasons are many.Charlie Watts' Moon-the-Loon drumming is untypical of him, I've gone to shows from seven or eight tours and never seen Charlie so bombastic.  Keef's incisive riffing is an intense rush as he drops phrases and fills with a surgeon's precision into the pauses of Jagger's vocals, which are excellent for being unforced but powerful.  He belts every word of Sweet Little Sixteen correctly, except the few he changes on purpose.  Ron Wood plays musical foil to Richards' guitar lines as well as being a visual foil of Mick's, their clowning at the front of the stage add adrenaline to the overall performance.  Bill Wyman had injured his wrist walking off the edge of the stage four shows earlier on the tour and doctors advised him to cancel the remaining dates; his response was to check out of the hospital the next day and, not only played a concert in St. Louis that night, but eight more to complete the tour.  Wyman and Ian Stewart's abilities and presence anchor this truly authentic Stones show, not the Rolling Stones Big Band tours we've witnessed the last twenty years.That being said, I don't think this is the Stones' pinnacle, yet they still had  street cred, seven out of 25 concerts in 1978 were small hall shows billed under ridiculous names like the London Green-Shoed Cowboys.  It became fashionable among name bands to play clubs under assumed names, i.e. Aerosmith's unannounced gigs as Dr. J. Jones & the Interns shortly after the Stones did it and validated the concept.  By `78 the Stones were past their 1972 peak although still walking and talking it convincingly.  I saw two stops of their `72 American summer run and thought they were far better than this particular night.  Bobby Keys and Jim Price occupying the Stones' bandstand never bothered me a bit.  And it goes without saying that EXILE ON MAIN STREET songs are superior to the ones on SOME GIRLS.  Despite my preferences I still rate this DVD five stars for its punk rock energy.Stevie Wonder opened for the Stones in '72 and his act was terrific but by no means did he steal a bolt of their thunder.  Peter Tosh opened for them at this show and I can assure you his band blew the Stones off the stage.  That hard groovin' reggae sounded superb in Will Rogers Auditorium and I kept thinking Watts & Co. were going to have to be on top of their game to follow Tosh.  I thought they were good that night but not great.  In hindsight they sound gritty and enthusiastic, great even.  Doug Kershaw doesn't count; I remember the Ft. Worth audience booed the poor guy off the stage before his band could finish their set.Last and least: a lot of Amazon reviewers seem to think Jagger's trousers were leather.  I distinctly recall them being plastic, only a grade heavier than a garbage bag.  Photos from the '78 tour indicate he had three pairs: black, red, and yellow.  Toward the end of the tour he patched tears in these pants with Xs of red gaffer's tape.",5,Finally this concert sees the authorized light of day,1327017600,"01 20, 2012",2012,3291,"['other', 'reviewers', 'attended', 'same', 'show', 'Also', ""'ve"", 'owned', 'incomplete', 'half', 'hour', 'bootleg', 'video', 'cassette', 'soundboard', 'recording', 'complete', 'show', '15', 'years', 'many', 'hours', 'pirated', 'live', 'Stones', 'video/audio', 'collection', 'favorites', 'why', 'eagerly', 'purchased', 'upgraded', 'DVD/CD', 'versions', 'reasons', 'are', 'many.Charlie', 'Watts', 'Moon-the-Loon', 'drumming', 'untypical', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'shows', 'seven', 'eight', 'tours', 'never', 'seen', 'Charlie', 'so', 'bombastic', 'Keef', 'incisive', 'riffing', 'intense', 'rush', 'phrases', 'fills', 'surgeon', 'precision', 'pauses', 'Jagger', 'vocals', 'are', 'excellent', 'being', 'unforced', 'powerful', 'belts', 'word', 'Sweet', 'Little', 'Sixteen', 'correctly', 'few', 'purpose', 'Ron', 'Wood', 'musical', 'foil', 'Richards', 'guitar', 'lines', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'visual', 'foil', 'Mick', 'clowning', 'front', 'stage', 'add', 'adrenaline', 'overall', 'performance', 'Bill', 'Wyman', 'had', 'injured', 'wrist', 'walking', 'off', 'edge', 'stage', 'four', 'earlier', 'tour', 'doctors', 'advised', 'cancel', 'remaining', 'dates', 'response', 'was', 'check', 'hospital', 'next', 'day', 'not', 'only', 'played', 'concert', 'St.', 'Louis', 'night', 'eight', 'more', 'complete', 'tour', 'Wyman', 'Ian', 'Stewart', 'abilities', 'presence', 'anchor', 'truly', 'authentic', 'Stones', 'show', 'not', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'Big', 'Band', ""'ve"", 'witnessed', 'last', 'twenty', 'years.That', 'being', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Stones', 'pinnacle', 'yet', 'still', 'had', 'street', 'cred', 'seven', '25', 'concerts', '1978', 'were', 'small', 'hall', 'shows', 'billed', 'ridiculous', 'names', 'London', 'Green-Shoed', 'Cowboys', 'became', 'fashionable', 'name', 'bands', 'play', 'clubs', 'assumed', 'names', 'i.e', 'Aerosmith', 'unannounced', 'gigs', 'Dr.', 'J.', 'Jones', 'Interns', 'shortly', 'Stones', 'did', 'validated', 'concept', '78', 'Stones', 'were', 'past', '1972', 'peak', 'still', 'walking', 'talking', 'convincingly', 'saw', 'two', 'stops', '72', 'American', 'summer', 'run', 'thought', 'were', 'far', 'better', 'particular', 'night', 'Bobby', 'Keys', 'Jim', 'Price', 'occupying', 'Stones', 'bandstand', 'never', 'bothered', 'bit', 'saying', 'EXILE', 'ON', 'MAIN', 'STREET', 'songs', 'are', 'superior', 'ones', 'SOME', 'GIRLS', 'preferences', 'still', 'rate', 'DVD', 'five', 'stars', 'punk', 'rock', 'energy.Stevie', 'Wonder', 'opened', 'Stones', ""'72"", 'act', 'was', 'terrific', 'means', 'did', 'steal', 'bolt', 'thunder', 'Peter', 'Tosh', 'opened', 'show', 'can', 'assure', 'band', 'blew', 'Stones', 'stage', 'hard', 'groovin', 'reggae', 'sounded', 'superb', 'Will', 'Rogers', 'Auditorium', 'kept', 'thinking', 'Watts', 'Co.', 'were', 'going', 'have', 'be', 'top', 'game', 'follow', 'Tosh', 'thought', 'were', 'good', 'night', 'not', 'great', 'hindsight', 'sound', 'gritty', 'enthusiastic', 'great', 'even', 'Doug', 'Kershaw', ""n't"", 'count', 'remember', 'Ft.', 'Worth', 'audience', 'booed', 'poor', 'guy', 'stage', 'band', 'could', 'finish', 'set.Last', 'least', 'lot', 'Amazon', 'reviewers', 'seem', 'think', 'Jagger', 'trousers', 'were', 'leather', 'distinctly', 'recall', 'being', 'plastic', 'only', 'grade', 'heavier', 'garbage', 'bag', ""'78"", 'tour', 'indicate', 'had', 'three', 'pairs', 'black', 'red', 'yellow', 'end', 'tour', 'patched', 'tears', 'pants', 'Xs', 'red', 'gaffer', 'tape']",Rolling Stones: Some Girls Live In Texas '78

1496269,AFGZVWW9XX63G,B005OGYH9A,D. G. Devin,"[116, 123]","I confess this isn't my favorite period for the Stones, at the time I didn't care for the Stones following trends instead of the public following what the Stones wanted to do.  But I couldn't help but be impressed with the performance in this film, if this was the Stones proving they were still on top I have to admit they accomplished that.Ronnie Wood still playing guitar like he meant it instead of mugging and posing, what wouldn't I give to see that again. Keith looked and sounded good, you can see the beginnings of those patented Keef stage moves that later would too often substitute for playing guitar. He must have been clean at this point, every time he and Mick had to meet at one mic to sing together he was there every time right on the beat. Jagger, well what can you say, talk about the hardest working man in show biz. I was surprised at how much guitar he played, and not one costume change, how modest. Charlie was on fire, whip crack energy for the whole show. Bill Wyman looked like it could have been 1969 or 1989, the only thing moving on him were his fingers but he sure was in the groove. Good to see Stu, and Ian McLagan, and no brass section was also a surprise, I didn't realize how stripped-down this tour was. Seeing the primitive (by today's standards) PA setup was funny, and watching Mick climb around in front of the heaps of speakers made me think that must have been what led him to go for bigger stages that would let him dance all over and work the crowd on the sides, no need to put one foot on a roadie's shoulder for balance.This was the last gasp for the music carrying the show without oversized staging and special effects, maybe it was because the Stones thought they had something to prove but the energy of this concert is amazing.  The people who shot this film had to badger Jagger into letting them do it.  But I can see why at long last Jagger decided to let it out of the vault (apparently they didn't release it back then because they thought they looked too old!), a performance of this caliber does the band great credit.  So color me impressed despite preferring the band's earlier work, this is a terrific contribution to the Stone's legacy.",5,The Stones at full throttle,1319068800,"10 20, 2011",2011,2200,"['confess', ""n't"", 'favorite', 'period', 'Stones', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'Stones', 'following', 'trends', 'instead', 'public', 'following', 'what', 'Stones', 'wanted', 'do', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'impressed', 'performance', 'film', 'was', 'Stones', 'proving', 'were', 'still', 'top', 'have', 'admit', 'accomplished', 'that.Ronnie', 'Wood', 'still', 'playing', 'guitar', 'meant', 'instead', 'mugging', 'posing', 'what', 'would', ""n't"", 'give', 'see', 'again', 'Keith', 'looked', 'sounded', 'good', 'can', 'see', 'beginnings', 'patented', 'Keef', 'stage', 'moves', 'later', 'would', 'too', 'often', 'substitute', 'playing', 'guitar', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'clean', 'point', 'time', 'Mick', 'had', 'meet', 'one', 'mic', 'sing', 'together', 'was', 'there', 'time', 'right', 'beat', 'Jagger', 'well', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'talk', 'hardest', 'working', 'man', 'show', 'biz', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'guitar', 'played', 'not', 'one', 'costume', 'change', 'how', 'modest', 'Charlie', 'was', 'fire', 'whip', 'crack', 'energy', 'whole', 'show', 'Bill', 'Wyman', 'looked', 'could', 'have', 'been', '1969', '1989', 'only', 'thing', 'moving', 'were', 'fingers', 'sure', 'was', 'groove', 'Good', 'see', 'Stu', 'Ian', 'McLagan', 'brass', 'section', 'was', 'also', 'surprise', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'how', 'stripped-down', 'tour', 'was', 'Seeing', 'primitive', 'today', 'standards', 'PA', 'setup', 'was', 'funny', 'watching', 'Mick', 'climb', 'around', 'front', 'heaps', 'speakers', 'made', 'think', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'led', 'go', 'bigger', 'stages', 'would', 'let', 'dance', 'work', 'crowd', 'sides', 'need', 'put', 'one', 'foot', 'roadie', 'shoulder', 'balance.This', 'was', 'last', 'gasp', 'music', 'carrying', 'show', 'oversized', 'staging', 'special', 'effects', 'maybe', 'was', 'Stones', 'thought', 'had', 'something', 'prove', 'energy', 'concert', 'amazing', 'people', 'who', 'shot', 'film', 'had', 'badger', 'Jagger', 'letting', 'do', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'long', 'last', 'Jagger', 'decided', 'let', 'vault', 'apparently', 'did', ""n't"", 'release', 'back', 'then', 'thought', 'looked', 'too', 'old', 'performance', 'caliber', 'band', 'great', 'credit', 'color', 'impressed', 'preferring', 'band', 'earlier', 'work', 'terrific', 'contribution', 'Stone', 'legacy']",Rolling Stones: Some Girls Live In Texas '78

1496273,AFUGKYQDO9C7N,B005OGYH9A,Edvis,"[14, 14]","If you'd like to open the hood, peer into the engine and see what truly made the Stones a band for the ages (perhaps THE band for the ages), this is the set to get.I first saw the movie via bootleg and then in a theater this fall, and it is phenomenal. With the CD, this rivals ""Gimme Shelter"" and ""Get Yer Ya Yas"" as their best live product. Throw in ""Ladies and Gentlemen,"" and there is no doubt who had the best band in the land from '69 to '78. Add their output from '62 on, and only the Beatles are as good. This is gargantuan.  No other band comes even close to this accomplishment, and no one else came close over this span of time -- from the early days of 60s rock to the full flowering of punk, standing proud amongst the avatars.I don't want to spoil any surprises, but about halfway through the lads really start to cook. While it may not be their most spectacular moment, I cannot imagine they were ever tighter or surer (comes with age, I suppose). I found myself thinking that this is how real men rock -- this despite what has to be Mick's most well-documented alpha-dog moment; i suppose it comes with the territory. He is the luckiest front man ever....what a great band, I stand in awe.Think about it: you have five of the original Stones here (including Ian Stewart, founding member, on the keys), plus two Faces. I'll take this lineup into battle any day. Add in the fact that this is a single concert vs an amalgam of performances, and we may have the winner.Historical note and another great thing about the video: In the movie, Keef's hair is still '70s elegance, and with his legitimate '70s getup he almost looks beautiful. Cut to the Saturday Night Live performances, and we see the latter-day Keef hairdo, missing only the fishing hooks and other gew-gaws that eventually made their way into his tangled locks.

When I wearily set about replacing it I decided to make some savings by not replacing the live recordings. The primary reason for this was the Rolling Stones - Mick Jagger just did not sound like he did on the studio recordings.Round about this time DVDs also started coming out and having an antipathy to live recordings I never bothered with these at all. My epithany (on the road to Damascus) came when I found the Led Zeppelin live DVD going for a ridiculously low price. I didn't particularly want it but found it so insulting to these legends to be sold so cheap I just bought it to get it off the shelf. What a revelation that was! Slowly but surely I began buying DVDs, deciding to have one per favourite group just to see them live.That policy just didn't work with the Rolling Stones (though it has with many others) because quite literally each DVD I bought was better than the last. It has got to the point where I now own virtually every live DVD by the RS as well as most of their live CDs. More than that, I have now completely reversed my own music-buying philosophy to the point where I now buy virtually nothing but live music.The Stones certainly are a visual act. I've read it all elsewhere in these reviews - and these reviews were the reason I bought Some Girls - but what are good tracks on the studio recording become great tracks live. My previous RS purchase was Ladies and Gentlemen, which I thoroughly enjoyed, but so far I find Some Girls a considerable improvement. They seem both more raw and better musicians, Mick is less effeminate and the songs are great. I have been acquiring RS DVDs backwards, in effect, from later to earlier performance. I'm dead keen to get some of the Brian Jones-era recordings now.",5,THIS is the one to own!,1340064000,"06 19, 2012",2012,1869,"['only', 'just', 'bought', 'am', 'blown', 'away', 'little', 'history', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'had', 'entire', 'music', 'collection', 'stolen', 'When', 'wearily', 'set', 'replacing', 'decided', 'make', 'savings', 'not', 'replacing', 'live', 'recordings', 'primary', 'reason', 'was', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'Mick', 'Jagger', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'sound', 'did', 'studio', 'recordings.Round', 'time', 'DVDs', 'also', 'started', 'coming', 'out', 'having', 'antipathy', 'live', 'recordings', 'never', 'bothered', 'epithany', 'road', 'Damascus', 'came', 'when', 'found', 'Led', 'Zeppelin', 'live', 'DVD', 'going', 'ridiculously', 'low', 'price', 'did', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'want', 'found', 'so', 'insulting', 'legends', 'be', 'sold', 'so', 'cheap', 'just', 'bought', 'get', 'off', 'shelf', 'What', 'revelation', 'was', 'Slowly', 'surely', 'began', 'buying', 'DVDs', 'deciding', 'have', 'one', 'favourite', 'group', 'just', 'see', 'policy', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'many', 'others', 'quite', 'literally', 'DVD', 'bought', 'was', 'better', 'last', 'got', 'point', 'where', 'now', 'own', 'virtually', 'live', 'DVD', 'RS', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'live', 'CDs', 'More', 'have', 'now', 'completely', 'reversed', 'own', 'music-buying', 'philosophy', 'point', 'where', 'now', 'buy', 'virtually', 'nothing', 'live', 'music.The', 'Stones', 'certainly', 'are', 'visual', 'act', ""'ve"", 'read', 'elsewhere', 'reviews', 'reviews', 'were', 'reason', 'bought', 'Girls', 'what', 'are', 'good', 'tracks', 'studio', 'recording', 'become', 'great', 'tracks', 'live', 'previous', 'RS', 'purchase', 'was', 'Ladies', 'Gentlemen', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'so', 'far', 'find', 'Girls', 'considerable', 'improvement', 'seem', 'more', 'raw', 'better', 'musicians', 'Mick', 'less', 'effeminate', 'songs', 'are', 'great', 'have', 'been', 'acquiring', 'RS', 'DVDs', 'backwards', 'effect', 'later', 'earlier', 'performance', ""'m"", 'dead', 'keen', 'get', 'Brian', 'Jones-era', 'recordings', 'now']",Rolling Stones: Some Girls Live In Texas '78

Look, this thing is getting reviewed through the roof for a reason, and the negative reviews tend to focus on technical issues. I must confess that they do not concern me. What a pleasant surprise the release of this DVD is. A great time to see the Stones too. Here they are after all the transition mess of the mid-70's with Ron Wood fully incorporated and a hit album to go out on stage with and strut. And this album is a strutter and you get most of it in this show, which is also nice. Many of the technical deficiencies that people complain about with ""Ladies & Gentlemen"" are absent here. It is well lit, it is reasonably well directed and it is all from one show. The idea that this hasn't seen the light of day until now is really quite something - what other gems like this await a similar release? Brussels? Hampton Roads? Los Angeles? I had heard something about a film floating around from this tour, but honestly I didn't put much stock in it and figured it was something on the order of ""C*** S***** Blues"" - some disjointed, mish mash of questionable production quality that one day would surface on some cheese ball over priced bootleg. Well, I was wrong. Good. This has to be considered the best Rolling Stones concert DVD - with perhaps only The Rolling Stones at the Max (Steel Wheels Tour and really great DVD) comparing with it or besting it. For now, this Stones concert DVD is my tops. I like the intimacy due to the size of the venue, the size of the stage and the camera positions. You get a better sense of what it is like to be at the ""show"" here than with any other Stones DVD, as far as I am concerned. And then also, the fact that the show is supporting the ""Some Girls"" album is great too. You get 7 songs from the 10 song album. That is pretty unusual too, but it contributes to the ""real"" concert feel of this show - as opposed to the ""revue"" style shows we have had from the Stones since Steel Wheels. It is a great album and the hi-lites from this concert - and there are several throughout - are terrific performances of ""Beast of Burden"" and ""Shattered"". You will love this DVD.

In addition to scheduling opened air stadiums like Soldier Field in Chicago and domed stadiums like New Orleans' Superdome, they scheduled several smaller venues like The Fox Theater in Atlanta and Will Rogers Auditorium in Fort Worth, Texas (my current home).  Under the pseudo name of ""The London Green Shoed Cowboys"", the Stones appeared during a 105 degree summer evening in 1978.Ron Wood had been with the band for the last 3 of the Stones 16 year collaboration at this point.  They decided to film this concert in front of 3000 loyal 20-something fans using a Texas based company called Showco.  They do a stellar job under the circumstances using several hand held but stable cameras.  The direction is very good.  You get to enjoy the music and the atmosphere not a series of fast cuts and camera tricks.  The concert itself clocks in at about 85 minutes but there is no filler.They open the show with start-em-up rockers ""Let It Rock"", ""All Down the Line"" and ""Honky Tonk Women.""  They never let up.  The Rolling Stones were at their best during this show, which had numerous songs from their new album (""Miss You"", ""When the Whip Comes Down"", ""Imagination"", countrified ""Far Away Eyes"", ""Respectable"", and ""Shattered"").  Mick Jagger is in high gear and prances all over the stage, taking time to get close to the fans.  He also seemed a bit taken with Wood, playfully fondling and snuggling up to him on occasion.  A little weird I thought.  I digress.Perhaps the best reason of all to own this concert is a spectacular DTS-HD sound treatment (in addition to Dolby Digital and PCM Stereo).  The entire disc last about 128 minutes with some added features.  Specifically a 2011 interview of Mick Jagger by Paul Sexton where he reflects back on this concert and tour and  a 1978 skit from ""Saturday Night Live"" featuring Jagger and Dan Akroid.  This is followed by a rare (for SNL) 3 song performance by the band.  Finally there is a brief segment from ABC 20/20, also in 1978 which features the band (Bassist Bill Wyman actually speaks!) being interviewed by long haired Geraldo Rivera.

1496295,A1QVFHPY8418HC,B005OGYH9A,monkuboy,"[4, 13]","I'll probably get nothing but ""unhelpful"" votes for this review but oh, well.First of all, the video and audio portions of the Blu Ray are quite good, considering it was recorded in 1978. No complaints about that, they did a great job of transferring this to disc.I have to say, I am not a huge Stones fan. I do like many of their songs but I've always been one who prefers the Beatles style over the Stones style. I did want to see a good concert video of the Stones, however, and so based on the reviews of Some Girls, I purchased this one.Personally, while some reviewers have said the performance and the level of musicianship was spot on, to me it sounded very loose and sloppy.  Yes, everyone is rocking out but I found a sameness to much of the performance. I could only understand about 25% of the words Mick Jagger was singing.  I figure most folks who were in the audience, and most who buy this Blu Ray are diehard fans of the band and loved every minute of the concert. I thought it was good, but not great as so many people have described it.I purchased the Cream Live at Royal Albert Hall 2005 Blu Ray at the same time and prefer that concert. I know it is sort of like apples to oranges since Cream was not concerned about whipping the audience into a frenzy or putting on an entertainment spectacular - they were there to play their music rather than to strut around the stage and look like they were partying. I guess I am more of a music than a show person, though - the level of musicianship was much higher and the concert itself was more interesting.Going back to the Some Girls Blu Ray - I'd rather listen to the studio versions of the songs. There's something to be said about the video appeal of this Blu Ray (if you want to watch them put on a show) but if you have your eyes closed and just listen to the music, it sounds pretty sloppy.",3,so-so,1325462400,"01 2, 2012",2012,1862,"[""'ll"", 'probably', 'get', 'nothing', 'unhelpful', 'votes', 'review', 'oh', 'well.First', 'video', 'audio', 'portions', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'considering', 'was', 'recorded', '1978', 'complaints', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'transferring', 'disc.I', 'have', 'say', 'am', 'not', 'huge', 'Stones', 'fan', 'do', 'many', 'songs', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'one', 'who', 'Beatles', 'style', 'Stones', 'style', 'did', 'want', 'see', 'good', 'concert', 'video', 'Stones', 'however', 'so', 'based', 'reviews', 'Girls', 'purchased', 'one.Personally', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'performance', 'level', 'musicianship', 'was', 'spot', 'sounded', 'very', 'loose', 'sloppy', 'Yes', 'everyone', 'rocking', 'out', 'found', 'sameness', 'much', 'performance', 'could', 'only', 'understand', 'about', '25', '%', 'words', 'Mick', 'Jagger', 'was', 'singing', 'figure', 'most', 'folks', 'who', 'were', 'audience', 'most', 'who', 'buy', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'are', 'diehard', 'fans', 'band', 'loved', 'minute', 'concert', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'described', 'it.I', 'purchased', 'Cream', 'Live', 'Royal', 'Albert', 'Hall', '2005', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'same', 'time', 'prefer', 'concert', 'know', 'sort', 'like', 'apples', 'oranges', 'Cream', 'was', 'not', 'concerned', 'whipping', 'audience', 'frenzy', 'putting', 'entertainment', 'spectacular', 'were', 'there', 'play', 'music', 'rather', 'strut', 'stage', 'look', 'were', 'partying', 'guess', 'am', 'more', 'music', 'show', 'person', 'level', 'musicianship', 'was', 'much', 'higher', 'concert', 'was', 'more', 'interesting.Going', 'back', 'Girls', 'Blu', 'Ray', ""'d"", 'rather', 'listen', 'studio', 'versions', 'songs', 'something', 'be', 'said', 'video', 'appeal', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'want', 'watch', 'put', 'show', 'have', 'eyes', 'closed', 'just', 'listen', 'music', 'pretty', 'sloppy']",Rolling Stones: Some Girls Live In Texas '78

And rock they do on WHEN THE WHIP COMES DOWN, ALL DOWN THE LINE, SWEET LITTLE SIXTEEN, RESPECTABLE, HAPPY and others.It's mainly uptempo (with some telling fluffs), though LOVE IN VAIN (with some of the feel STRAY CAT BLUES, live at MSG in '69), and FAR AWAY EYES (not a classic but nifty B-side material), serve as reminders of this group's diverse catalogue (and some cardiovascular relief for the wildly enthused attendees).Casual fans will especially enjoy watching Jagger bang out a few chords of his own on many numbers (and even on keyboard!).The guys look great, about five years older than they did at TAMI, though Jagger looks like he's missed a few meals along the way - fashion model skinny, and horribly outfitted. (He discusses ""wardrobe"" during the fascinating 2011 Interview in the features).It's always rewarding to atch the Stones pay direct or indirect tribute to their ""idols"" and the two Berry covers are predictably great; while Keith is celebrating Chuck, Mick is doing the same for another 1950s legend named Richard. Too bad they couldn't work in a number by the guy who took the group on ttheir first important European tour, in late 1963. [Mick even throws in a couple of ""Oh My Soul""(s)].This Texas show was captured long before the present day tendency towards ""cool"" caera work, with hectic editing, and next to no audience shots.

Smallish stage, none of the distractions of monster blow up dolls or other contraptions, no backup singers, no horn section, just the Stones and their piano player and a pretty much unseen organ. Not that the horns and Lisa Fisher, Bernie Fowler, et al don't add to the show on a larger stage, they most definitely do, but this is the Stones in about as basic a form as you will find them.The sound is superb. The video is as it should be, and likely the best it could be given the original medium. The performance is non-stop, with Mick being especially ""playful"", especially in grabbing Ronnie where he might not ought to have. Bill Wyman is as Bill Wyman was, appearing suitably bored throughout. But, who went to see Wyman anyway? Keith was on, how that happens is always a mystery, as was Ron Wood, though Woodie didn't seem quite as animated as he is at times. Charlie is his rock steady, never miss a beat self. Overall, it is a Jagger focused show as usual, with just enough time on the rest of the band to know they were there with him.Overall, this is my favorite Stones video, and I have them all. Maybe that opinion might change if the Brussels Affair is ever released on video, if you have an isp or proxy outside the US you can download a flac version of the Brussels Affair audio from the Stones marketing website and it is quite good, with Mick Taylor on guitar, and very up tempo. So I am hoping that show makes it onto video before too long.

Personally I thoroughly enjoyed the video of this concert. It came across as a back to basics performance with apparently eight of the 17 songs performed coming from the some girls studio album. The video concert time is one hour and 23 minutes, and the CD is one hour and 20 minutes: the three minutes difference is basically some purely visual elements taken out in the remixing/remastering comes across as masterful. In the credits it indicates that the video had been cleaned up and extensively processed; since I have not seen the original footage, I have nothing to compare it with, so I don't know how much of an improvement it is. The Blu-ray bonuses have an interview from 2011 with Mick Jagger and it explains a lot of context for the way Mick was dressed and also for the way songs were selected . The Saturday Night Live excerpt is excellent with versions of beast of burden, respectable, and shattered that come across in an extremely good and clear way. The final extra is a very brief interview with the stones from ABC news and it has a couple of video clips that are very nice.The studio version of some of the SOME GIRLS studio album has some great bass playing, which I presume is Bill Wyman. Playing the Blu-ray and the CD on 5.1 sound systems gives a very clear perception of the overall mix, and the bass (which in bills case I must admit to being partial to) comes across fairly well if you turn it up a little bit: essentially the bass is not overdone, it's not underdone, it is just very clear. Charlie Watts plays brilliantly as always. Bill Wyman lays down the laconic bass as only he can. The interplay between Ron Wood and Keith Richards is basically brilliant. The nice thing about the mix of songs is that they picked some old blues, classic rock, and of course a great selection of their own material. This is a concert for a smaller venue, and in that respect it is very intimate, and the video captures that element of the performance. If you listen to the 2011 interview, you can understand the reasons why the Rolling Stones did what they did in this smaller venue. I took it for what it was, had no preconceptions and was happily relieved by the quality of the concert and of the CD.

Assisting them--the redoubtable Ian Stewart, Ian McLagan, and Doug Kershaw. The tour was in support of their new album, &#34;Some Girls.&#34; It featured many songs from the album, but also featured other songs from earlier. And, boy, do the Stones look young!The concert depicted here begins with &#34;Let It Rock&#34; and ends with &#34;Jumpin' Jack Flash,&#34; with many songs in between. A few words about some of the songs: &#34;Let It Rock.&#34; Good old-fashioned rock and roll, good guitar work by Richards and Wood. &#34;All Down the Line&#34;: A little rough, but good rock and roll. &#34;Honky Tonk Women&#34;: As raunchy as ever. Well done. &#34;Star Star&#34;: The words would offend many, but the band seems to enjoy playing this. The reference to Steve McQueen always brings a smile! The rhythm section is rock solid, with Wyman and Watts doing well.&#34;When the Whip Comes Down&#34;: Mick Jagger plays a bit of guitar here, but it is Wood's and Richards' riffing that makes the song. &#34;Miss You&#34;: An energetic version. &#34;Imagination&#34;: I think that this old Temptations' song represents one of their better covers of the work of others. There is a wistful tone to the song and the band plays well. &#34;Shattered&#34;: I like to think of this song in juxtaposition with &#34;Hot Stuff.&#34; &#34;Shattered&#34; is a cool tune! Then, the classic blues song, &#34;Love in Vain.&#34; Played well as blues. &#34;Jumpin' Jack Flash&#34;: One of the best rock riffs starts this off.

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[9, 9]","There are already quite a few reviews here of the theater version of the film so I won't repeat a lot of that here, except to say that there is a lot of variety in the song selection. You'll hear more about that in the superfine ""bonus features"" which are enough to encourage you to buy the DVD even if you saw the film. And that's what I'm going to concentrate on here.First off, I can't remember if it was noted that the concert was FILMED (not videotaped) in 16mm and so it is grainy in most spots and the shots of the audience are often dark (not so the music however). So, even though I have not seen the Blu-ray version, I doubt that the image will improve much.Now on to the bonuses, some of which relates to 1978, when the concert took place. First there is 14-minute one-on-one interview with Mick Jagger done in June 2011. Jagger looks old for the first time (okay it is 33 years after the concert but it is a bit shocking - since I think I last saw him about 3 years ago in an interview). All the questioned revolve around the ""Some Girls"" tour and you'll hear about the set list, the venues and why you don't see the usual security guys in front of the stage. Next comes a 20-minute segment from their 1978 gig on ""Saturday Night Live"", starting off with Jagger doing a skit with Dan Ackroyd (as Tom Snyder), followed by 3 songs by the whole band: ""Beast of Burden"", ""Respectable""- where Mick suns his infamous tongue all over Ronnie Wood's face (on Network TV!) and then ""Shattered"" (where the lyrics are muffled and - since this was a NEW song - the lyrics aren't clear.)  The last bonus feature is a 5-minute profile of the band - with a brief interview - by Geraldo Rivera from a 1978 20/20 episode on ABC-TA real nice package from Eagle Rock at a fair price.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",5,The Stones then...

1496306,A1K3NQAO49LXL2,B005OGYH9A,"Surferofromantica ""S.O.R.""","[2, 2]","According to the essay in the eight-page booklet that comes with the DVD, the band announced a secret gig in Fort Worth, Texas, on July 18th, 1978 at the Will Rogers Auditorium, a 3,000-seater, under cover as ""The London Green Shoed Cowboys"". Everybody saw through the ruse, and tickets were in high demand.The DVD is a testament to a pretty good show. The band goes out and does their thing, with Mick covered up in a hat and jacket and some sort of weird mock leather track pants, which he slowly peels off part by part as the show goes on - the hat goes, then the jacket, and finally also the shirt. There's the usual onstage Stones chaos, and at one point we see a roadie mopping up some spill onstage. Keith looks frazzled, and pretty sloppy in a weird silk shirt, but he pulls through. Unlike Ladies And Gentlemen, The Rolling Stones, this concert was recorded on one night, rather than edited together from parts recorded over a series of nights.For a few songs, Mick plays a brown Stratocaster as a prop (does his playing really make a difference, if he's even playing at all?). Looks like Elvis or Bruce Dickinson slinging a guitar - awkward. Keith plays a tan Telecaster (then, later on, a black Telecaster), Woody is on a mirrored Les Paul. Mick tries to smooch Ron Wood, later grabs his jeans, even later slaps his behind - must be some weird initiation thing. Mick's trying to look like Bob Dylan singing powerfully with a guitar, but he looks more like a proto-Bryan Adams (what I'm really trying to say is that he shouldn't play guitar - and after that he didn't). ""Just My Imagination"" jam, Mick bug-eyed at the end. Mick has guitar for four songs in a row (""When The Whip Comes Down"", Beast Of Burden"", ""Miss You"" and ""Imagination""), leaves it off for the next song, then picks it up again for ""Respectable"". Woody picks a cigarette (?) up off the floor, offers it to Mick. Mick, with jacket, looks like he has no arms. ""Shattered"" ends with a jab. ""Are you feeling good? I always feel good in Texas; I'm afraid if the band's slightly lacking in energy is because they spent all of last night loving. But we do our best."" Mick on piano for ""Far Away Eyes"", he then moves to keyboard. Ron Wood on slide. Fiddlist Doug Kershaw (who had opened the show), came back to play on this song - jarring. ""Love In Vain"", Ron Wood plays black and silver Telecaster slide. ""Tumbling Dice"", Woody plays mother of pearl-flecked Les Paul, Mick grabs his jeans again at 1:04:00. Mick finally removes jacket. In ""Happy"", he pretends to slap Woody's face, then slaps his behind. There's a bit of a tongue thing. Best song on concert. Keith is ferocious. In ""Brown Sugar"", Mick removes shirt, whips Woody with it (of course). Big girl in back going crazy. Crowd response, Mick throws water on audience.The documentary has 15 minutes of interview with Sir Mick, and 20 minutes from a 1978 Saturday Night Live performance, and then about two minutes of American TV interviewing - 20/20, with some stuff from Geraldo Rivera.In the documentary, Mick talks about the tolerant musical diversity of the time in New York, with acceptance of dance music, punk and country all happening at the same time. Mentions the Sugarhill Gang, referenced Dr Dre's remix of ""Miss You"" of many years later, I guess he's hinting that the band was ahead of their time. ""Shattered"" has semi-rap sing-talk in it. You really see how old he is here, with big eccentric House of Lords-style eyebrows and small eyes. Mick dresses in a white suit and records the Tomorrow Show with Dan Ackroyd, who has multi-coloured hair and smokes a cigarette throughout the piece. Mick has fun with Dan, not the other way around, ha ha ha... Nothing special in the interview, but the live footage is good, especially as they play the same egalitarian sound stage that all other SNL performers use. Mick steals Woody's cig, then whips him on the face and jeans with his towel. Jeez!

This is a relatively small venue show, with only about 3,000 fans packing the hall. Jagger puts on a terrific show, belting out some of these songs with a ferocious energy rare even for him. Quite a few ""Some Girls"" tracks are played - all in a row, seven I believe - so liking that album is definitely helpful going in. Keith steps up for a great version of ""Happy,"" and Ron Wood shares some amusing interplay with Jagger. Charlie and Bill are rarely shown. There were no horns for this show, just a pair of keyboard players.The concert was filmed on 16mm film and is grainy - but the quality is quite good. Audience reactions shots are thankfully kept to a minimum. Apparently this summer indoor show was swelteringly hot, and Mick douses the crowd with several buckets of water near the end.It's a super good idea to include the concert as an audio CD. Even though this release is available as JUST a DVD or Blu-ray, both versions are available with the live CD. I highly recommend the combo.

1496310,AK7HA5YU06NLG,B005OGYH9A,The Scenario,"[11, 17]","First off, the performance - top notch. The Stones at their ragged, sleazy 70's best, and in fact performing way better and tighter than they would 3 years later on the 1981 North American Tour (at least according to the performances on ""Let's Spend The Night Together"", still my favorite Stones' movie, but their playing was definitely a lot sloppier).  It would've been nice to have some footage of their stadium shows from this tour since it was their first such tour, but this will suffice. It kinda looks like a baby version of ""Shine A Light"", since both were shot in small theaters. And the sound and setlist are both great. Anyone looking for ""Satisfaction"" or a good representation of their 60's hits will be sorely disappointed.  The Stones in the 70's promoted themselves as a 70's band all the way, and that meant they heavily pushed whatever album they were touring behind, plus a smattering of tunes from ""Exile On Main Street"" and their other albums from that decade so far.  In fact, the 60's are only represented by ""Love In Vain"" and ""Jumping Jack Flash"".  Doesn't matter, it's a great concert, no doubt.As for the picture...I don't know much about video restoration, but couldn't this have been cleaned up a bit more?  Geez, it just looks so washed out and colorless.  Blacks are grey, yellows are white, and everything just looks bleached out and grainy.  Knowing what a great job was done on the ""Led Zeppelin"" DVD (from nearly 9 years ago - a millennium in technological time), how the 1969 concert from the Royal Albert Hall was cleaned up to look like it'd been shot the day before, couldn't this have been put through a similar process to give it a nice detailing job?The extras are nice.  The ""SNL"" performances are famous more for how bad they were (Jaggers' croaky voice, the band's listless performance) than anything else, but it's a good historical artifact, as is the ""20/20"" piece from 1978.4 stars for the performance, 2 stars for the picture quality...3 stars overall.",3,Could they not have cleaned it up a little better?,1322265600,"11 26, 2011",2011,2003,"['First', 'off', 'performance', 'top', 'notch', 'Stones', 'ragged', 'sleazy', '70', 'best', 'fact', 'performing', 'way', 'better', 'tighter', 'would', '3', 'years', 'later', '1981', 'North', 'American', 'Tour', 'least', 'according', 'performances', 'Let', 'Spend', 'Night', 'Together', 'still', 'favorite', 'Stones', 'movie', 'playing', 'was', 'definitely', 'lot', 'sloppier', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'footage', 'stadium', 'tour', 'was', 'first', 'such', 'tour', 'will', 'suffice', 'kinda', 'baby', 'version', 'Shine', 'Light', 'were', 'shot', 'small', 'theaters', 'sound', 'setlist', 'are', 'great', 'Anyone', 'looking', 'Satisfaction', 'good', 'representation', '60', 'hits', 'will', 'be', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'Stones', '70', 'promoted', '70', 'band', 'way', 'meant', 'heavily', 'pushed', 'were', 'touring', 'behind', 'smattering', 'tunes', 'Exile', 'Main', 'Street', 'other', 'albums', 'decade', 'so', 'far', 'fact', '60', 'are', 'only', 'represented', 'Love', 'Vain', 'Jumping', 'Jack', 'Flash', ""n't"", 'matter', 'great', 'concert', 'doubt.As', 'picture', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'video', 'restoration', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'cleaned', 'up', 'bit', 'more', 'Geez', 'just', 'so', 'washed', 'out', 'colorless', 'Blacks', 'are', 'grey', 'yellows', 'are', 'white', 'everything', 'just', 'looks', 'bleached', 'out', 'grainy', 'Knowing', 'what', 'great', 'job', 'was', 'done', 'Led', 'Zeppelin', 'DVD', 'nearly', '9', 'years', 'ago', 'millennium', 'technological', 'time', 'how', '1969', 'concert', 'Royal', 'Albert', 'Hall', 'was', 'cleaned', 'up', 'look', ""'d"", 'been', 'shot', 'day', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'put', 'similar', 'process', 'give', 'nice', 'detailing', 'job', 'extras', 'are', 'nice', 'SNL', 'performances', 'are', 'famous', 'more', 'how', 'bad', 'were', 'Jaggers', 'croaky', 'voice', 'band', 'listless', 'performance', 'anything', 'else', 'good', 'historical', 'artifact', '20/20', 'piece', '1978.4', 'stars', 'performance', '2', 'stars', 'picture', 'quality', '3', 'stars', 'overall']",Rolling Stones: Some Girls Live In Texas '78

The Stones are on fire in this performance, marred only by Mick's campy performance. Mick went through a very campy period and the '78 tour was the zenith (or nadir depending on your view). During the bonus 2011 interview, Mick goes to great lengths to explain his stage costume. He must realize how stupid it looks in retrospect and is trying to cover for it. Luckily the rest of the band is tight and you can see and hear the great Ian Stewart on the piano. The picture quality is actually quite good considering that this was filmed (yes filmed) in 1978. The bonus features include the also widely-bootlegged Saturday Night Live performance when Mick's voice was shot by doing coke all week long during rehearsals. (True story. Read any reliable book on Stones history.) Mick camps it up more than ever, licking Ronnie's face and shamelessly pandering to the camera. Some younger fans may not get the ""Tomorrow"" skit and probably have no idea who Tom Snyder was. That segment may go right over your heads but it was priceless comedy at the time.
