This season should have been called ""The Boston Rob Show"" and he is one of my least favorite survivors ever.  He and Amber annoyed me to no end.  Where are the DECENT seasons?  Where is Australia, where is Marquesas, Where is Amazon??  All-Stars was absolute BS and the most predictable and boring season of the entire series run.  It was the Second-Worst ""Survivor"" ever (after Thailand).The worst part about this is that no one will buy it and it will kill the chance of GOOD seasons being released in the future.  Paramount killed ""Real World"" complete season DVD releases the same way.  They released Season One and then the Las Vegas season right after it had been airing 24/7 on MTV.  No one bought it and they haven't released a season since.  These people need to talk to the fans of the show and truly consider releasing older seasons.

831850,A1XBMS6MN8X5JX,B0002ERWV4,"Amazon Customer ""mark_cohen""","[10, 16]","As someone who's seen every season of Survivor, I honestly felt this to be the weakest of them all. As the ""All-Stars"" had already been through the game before, there was little amazement at the experience, and it was purely strategic playing that was going on. Good for the players, but not for the audience.Still, as an admitted Survivor-addict, I purchased this boxed set. What can I tell you about this DVD compilation?First, despite claiming to be ""Survivor All-Stars: The Complete Season,"" this set is actually INcomplete. When you get to Disc 4, look at the packaging: the episode numbers jump from 808 to 810. 809, which was the recap show ""The First 24 Days,"" was inexplicably left out. True, no one actually cares about the episode when they're watching this series on a weekly basis, but to have a ""complete"" set that has deleted scenes but is missing one episode which had other deleted scenes is bizarre.The commentaries are very funny. It's amusing that Lex and Kathy still aren't over their ""betrayal"" by Rob. It's also enlightening to hear Amber give really nasty commentary against virtually everyone on the jury - proving that she deserves to marry a guy like Rob. They're perfect for each other.The new material in the ""bonus footage"" varies from boring (Rob's Toothache) to mildly amusing (Tree Mail Letters), but there's nothing really great about them. Even the extended exit interviews rarely get interesting. The best bits from them are already at the end of each episode.The seventh disc full of bonus features is also severely lacking. Most features are under 4 minutes long. One is just a montage of scenes from all seasons. Even the compilation of ""the best CBS on-air promos"" only shows 1-3 promos per season.On the whole, this is a lousy set made passable by amusing commentaries. I'd recommend it only to the true Survivor die-hards who simply need to have every DVD related to the show.Like me, unfortunately.",2,"This ""Complete Season"" is INcomplete!",1094342400,"09 5, 2004",2004,1941,"['someone', 'who', 'seen', 'season', 'Survivor', 'honestly', 'felt', 'be', 'weakest', 'All-Stars', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'game', 'was', 'little', 'amazement', 'experience', 'was', 'purely', 'strategic', 'playing', 'was', 'going', 'Good', 'players', 'not', 'audience.Still', 'admitted', 'Survivor-addict', 'purchased', 'boxed', 'set', 'What', 'can', 'tell', 'DVD', 'compilation', 'First', 'claiming', 'be', 'Survivor', 'All-Stars', 'Complete', 'Season', 'set', 'actually', 'INcomplete', 'When', 'get', 'Disc', '4', 'look', 'packaging', 'episode', 'numbers', 'jump', '808', '810', '809', 'was', 'recap', 'show', 'First', '24', 'Days', 'was', 'inexplicably', 'left', 'out', 'True', 'one', 'actually', 'episode', 'when', ""'re"", 'watching', 'series', 'weekly', 'basis', 'have', 'complete', 'set', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'missing', 'one', 'episode', 'had', 'other', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'bizarre.The', 'commentaries', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'amusing', 'Lex', 'Kathy', 'still', 'are', ""n't"", 'betrayal', 'Rob', 'also', 'enlightening', 'hear', 'Amber', 'give', 'really', 'nasty', 'commentary', 'virtually', 'everyone', 'jury', 'proving', 'marry', 'guy', 'Rob', ""'re"", 'perfect', 'other.The', 'new', 'material', 'bonus', 'footage', 'varies', 'boring', 'Rob', 'Toothache', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'Tree', 'Mail', 'Letters', 'nothing', 'really', 'great', 'Even', 'extended', 'exit', 'interviews', 'rarely', 'get', 'interesting', 'best', 'bits', 'are', 'already', 'end', 'episode.The', 'seventh', 'disc', 'full', 'bonus', 'features', 'also', 'severely', 'lacking', 'Most', 'features', 'are', '4', 'minutes', 'long', 'One', 'just', 'montage', 'scenes', 'seasons', 'Even', 'compilation', 'best', 'CBS', 'on-air', 'promos', 'only', '1-3', 'promos', 'season.On', 'whole', 'lousy', 'set', 'made', 'passable', 'amusing', 'commentaries', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'only', 'true', 'Survivor', 'die-hards', 'who', 'simply', 'need', 'have', 'DVD', 'related', 'show.Like', 'unfortunately']",Survivor All-Stars - The Complete Season

Sue Hawk has an emotionally draining, and questionable, experience with Richard Hatch! Lex is horribly duped by Boston Rob, and pays with his life!

831864,A1464Z1X20MD2L,B0002ERWV4,Emily,"[0, 0]","I swore to myself I would never become a Survivor fan.  I watched other reality TV shows, sure, but Survivor was just ridiculous and degrading.  Or so I thought.  Last summer, I was watching TV and after doing some channel surfing and finding that there was nothing good on, I decided to watch an episode of Survivor.  OLN (aka VS.) was doing a summer marathon of Survivor episodes, and All Stars was on at that moment.  I forget exactly which episode I saw, but I know it was before Jenna M. left to be with her mom.  I watched one episode...and then another...and then another...and then another...and before I knew it, I was hooked.  I didn't even go online to check the winner before watching the ""live"" season finale...which I loved in so many ways.  I bought the DVD within weeks and decided to give the other seasons a chance.  None of the ones I've seen (Borneo, Australia, Pearl Islands, part of Vanuatu, Palau, part of Maya Empire, Exile Island, and this season's Cook Islands) matches up to All Stars, but I WILL say that Pearl Islands comes close.Why do I love the season so much?  I think it's because this season reminds me of the classic fairy tale ending in which everyone get what they deserves.  For example:Kathy: At first, I liked Kathy.  After seeing the All Stars DVD a second time, I realized that she's actually a nasty player.  Kathy was going to betray her tribe and join Chapera.  She was the second Mogo Mogo after the merge to get voted off.Shii Ann: I love Shii Ann.  Shii Ann did everything that she could do to get ahead in the game but when she got voted off, she didn't have Sue's reaction from season one.  Most importantly, she voted for Amber, realizing that Amber had the best strategy.  Her reward?  A car.Rob: Rob played the game well but ultimately his lies caught up to him.  Still, he got Amber and the two will share the million, so he honestly deserved second place.Amber: Where to begin?  I love Amber to death!  She played the game so well, with such a good strategy, that I believe that had Tina been on the jury, Amber would have received her vote.  She didn't lie so much as break promises and she never said anything bad about the other players.  Amber is the best Survivor player EVER, hands down.Lex: After backstabbing NUMEROUS people, Lex finally got what he deserved; betrayal, handed to him by Rob.  Based on the commentary, it doesn't sound like the two are friends.  Well, that's Lex's loss.Rupert: Probably the most honorable player there and definitely unfairly axed before his time on Pearl Islands, Rupert deserved to win the second million dollar prize.So, my concluding thoughts...best season ever.

If you have forgotten the order then hide the cover for at least some surprise to remain.  Whoever decided to do the cover like that needs to bring me their torch!!  Having said that, it is risky to do an all stars.  It's kind of like the risk Amazing Race took with the Family Edition.  The AR special edition season did not pay off.  Fortunately Survivor's risk did.  It paid off big time. This is the only season I actually own on DVD and that is because it is good enough to watch it over and over again.  The main reason for that is because of Rob Mariano.  He is a hoot.  I think he's the best player of the game yet.  If you don't like Rob then don't buy this season.  This DVD could be more aptly titled the Mariano edition.  I would not have necessarily picked all of these individuals to be considered ""all stars"" but a lot of that has to do with who agreed to actually put themselves through this one more time.  Rob was only slightly memorable from the first time he was on the show but this time he was ruthless.  If you are the type that watches Survivor in hopes that no one will actually ""play"" then you'll hate this one!!  People you loved last time may become villains.  Those who were masterful before are easily voted out.  This is truly full of surprises.

I watched the original Survivor simply because it was new, it had never been done before and I found that entertaining and compelling. After the first season I didn't return to Survivor until the All-Star edition began after last year's Super Bowl. The reason I tuned in? Because it was new and different. Nobody had ever returned to play this game a second time.Coming into this game, the All-Stars had to know that this was going to be different. Everything was going to be stepped up a notch and they had to bring their A games. As soon as the tribes set foot on the island, the elevated level of survival came boiling to the surface, as winners (of which there were four) realized that they had a huge target on their backs, and alliances began to form, one of which lasted until the bitter end.While Amber Brkich (Survivor Australia) walked away with the million dollar prize at the end of the game, this season, in every sense of the word, belonged to Boston Rob Mariano. He dominated the physical challenges and was incredibly strong in the mental ones as well. He outplayed everyone on the island, using everything he could, including friendships, to get him to the final two. It is kind of depressing on the commentaries and on the episodes themselves, to listen to the constant whining of Lex and Alicia. Both of these All-Stars were played by Boston Rob. He used them to get to the end, wh ich is the whole idea. They cried like babies about it and it is sad. Like original winner Richard Hatch said in the reunion show, ""It's just a game."" They should realize that he outplayed them, accept it and move on with their lives.As I said, Boston Rob outplayed everyone in the game, but he didn't win the million dollars, as I feel he probably deserved. He lost out because of the bitterness of two people who felt betrayed, in a game where betrayal always comes into play.For the All-Stars, Rupert, Jerri, Colby, Sue, Richard, Big Tom and the others provided plenty of entertainment. The challenges were extremely tough, probably the hardest ever, as they should be. You could see the complete exhaustion in the faces of these seasoned veterans of the game. This was not a walk in the jungle for anyone.While there are many people who could have been cast, it is possible, many didn't want to return to the game. I am sure there are a lot of people who would have liked to have seen Colleen, Greg and Gervase from Season One, or Michael Skupin or Elisabeth Filarski (Hasselbeck) from Australia, or any number of others. Despite all that, the All-Stars chosen were a diverse bunch and made for solid competition.The DVD set has a number of great extras, with lots of unaired scenes and confessionals. While the recap episode (Number Nine) is not included on this set, the best scene from that episode, the mock tribal council with Rob Cesternino's dead-on Jeff Probst impression, is included in the extra scenes. In addition there are a number of commentaries, including four featuring the hilarious Cesternino at the head of the pack.While this season didn't end up being the best Survivor ever, as claimed in the promos (In my mind that honor goes to season one), this was a pretty solid effort. It had never been done before and that in and of itself made it worth watching.Go out and buy this set. It is worth it. I also highly recommend purchasing the set from Season One, if for no other reason than the incredibly beautiful Colleen Haskell.",5,The Robfather Dominates,1099872000,"11 8, 2004",2004,3546,"['have', 'never', 'been', 'much', 'fan', 'reality', 'television', 'there', 'have', 'been', 'few', 'exceptions', 'watched', 'original', 'Survivor', 'simply', 'was', 'new', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'done', 'found', 'entertaining', 'compelling', 'first', 'season', 'did', ""n't"", 'return', 'Survivor', 'All-Star', 'edition', 'began', 'last', 'year', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'reason', 'tuned', 'was', 'new', 'different', 'Nobody', 'had', 'ever', 'returned', 'play', 'game', 'second', 'time.Coming', 'game', 'All-Stars', 'had', 'know', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'different', 'Everything', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'stepped', 'up', 'notch', 'had', 'bring', 'games', 'As', 'soon', 'tribes', 'set', 'foot', 'island', 'elevated', 'level', 'survival', 'came', 'boiling', 'surface', 'winners', 'were', 'four', 'realized', 'had', 'huge', 'target', 'backs', 'alliances', 'began', 'form', 'one', 'lasted', 'bitter', 'end.While', 'Amber', 'Brkich', 'Survivor', 'Australia', 'walked', 'away', 'million', 'dollar', 'prize', 'end', 'game', 'season', 'sense', 'word', 'belonged', 'Boston', 'Rob', 'Mariano', 'dominated', 'physical', 'challenges', 'was', 'incredibly', 'strong', 'mental', 'ones', 'as', 'well', 'outplayed', 'everyone', 'island', 'using', 'everything', 'could', 'including', 'friendships', 'get', 'final', 'two', 'kind', 'depressing', 'commentaries', 'episodes', 'listen', 'constant', 'whining', 'Lex', 'Alicia', 'All-Stars', 'were', 'played', 'Boston', 'Rob', 'used', 'get', 'end', 'wh', 'ich', 'whole', 'idea', 'cried', 'babies', 'sad', 'original', 'winner', 'Richard', 'Hatch', 'said', 'reunion', 'show', 'just', 'game', 'should', 'realize', 'outplayed', 'accept', 'move', 'lives.As', 'said', 'Boston', 'Rob', 'outplayed', 'everyone', 'game', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'million', 'dollars', 'feel', 'probably', 'deserved', 'lost', 'out', 'bitterness', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'felt', 'betrayed', 'game', 'where', 'betrayal', 'always', 'play.For', 'All-Stars', 'Rupert', 'Jerri', 'Colby', 'Sue', 'Richard', 'Big', 'Tom', 'others', 'provided', 'plenty', 'entertainment', 'challenges', 'were', 'extremely', 'tough', 'probably', 'hardest', 'ever', 'should', 'be', 'could', 'see', 'complete', 'exhaustion', 'seasoned', 'veterans', 'game', 'was', 'not', 'walk', 'jungle', 'anyone.While', 'are', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cast', 'possible', 'many', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'return', 'game', 'am', 'sure', 'are', 'lot', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'Colleen', 'Greg', 'Gervase', 'Season', 'One', 'Michael', 'Skupin', 'Elisabeth', 'Filarski', 'Hasselbeck', 'Australia', 'number', 'others', 'All-Stars', 'chosen', 'were', 'diverse', 'bunch', 'made', 'solid', 'competition.The', 'DVD', 'set', 'number', 'great', 'extras', 'lots', 'unaired', 'scenes', 'confessionals', 'recap', 'episode', 'Number', 'Nine', 'not', 'included', 'set', 'best', 'scene', 'episode', 'mock', 'tribal', 'council', 'Rob', 'Cesternino', 'dead-on', 'Jeff', 'Probst', 'impression', 'included', 'extra', 'scenes', 'addition', 'are', 'number', 'commentaries', 'including', 'four', 'featuring', 'hilarious', 'Cesternino', 'head', 'pack.While', 'season', 'did', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'being', 'best', 'Survivor', 'ever', 'claimed', 'promos', 'mind', 'honor', 'season', 'one', 'was', 'pretty', 'solid', 'effort', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'made', 'worth', 'out', 'buy', 'set', 'also', 'highly', 'recommend', 'purchasing', 'set', 'Season', 'One', 'other', 'reason', 'incredibly', 'beautiful', 'Colleen', 'Haskell']",Survivor All-Stars - The Complete Season

I mean I think at some points they were even making out in front of everyone else and EVERYONE knew that were together. I think its obvious that they should have tried to vote one of them out. Its just funny that amber won because some of the casting choices were obviously made because their first options told them no. Amber I am almost certain was not one of their first choices to cast. Then she follows that by winning all stars because of a lucky alliance.So you're going to want to watch this season but expect a lot of stupid decisions.

It gives you a lot of information about how some of them felt towards others out there and also some things that went on that the cameras didn't pick up.  With the exception of Jenna, Amber (Ambar), Rupet and Rob (who were all monotonos and BORING), the other groups that commentated were excellent and fun.  They had great personalities and it made a regular episode so much more fun to watch.Go out and buy this set because it's totally cool and especially if you are a big fan, you'll love it and keep it forever.",5,Fun and a definate must for all fans,1103328000,"12 18, 2004",2004,742,"['DVD', 'set', 'great', 'one', 'episode', 'missing', 'recap', 'episode', 'unseen', 'footage', 'fantastic', 'gift', 'fan', 'thing', 'loved', 'most', 'cast', 'comentary', 'many', 'episodes', 'lot', 'information', 'how', 'felt', 'towards', 'others', 'there', 'also', 'things', 'went', 'cameras', 'did', ""n't"", 'pick', 'up', 'exception', 'Jenna', 'Amber', 'Ambar', 'Rupet', 'Rob', 'who', 'were', 'monotonos', 'BORING', 'other', 'groups', 'commentated', 'were', 'excellent', 'fun', 'had', 'great', 'personalities', 'made', 'regular', 'episode', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'fun', 'watch.Go', 'out', 'buy', 'set', 'totally', 'cool', 'especially', 'are', 'big', 'fan', ""'ll"", 'love', 'keep', 'forever']",Survivor All-Stars - The Complete Season

Yes, you know who I speak of... Rob & Amber. However having already seen the season, I decided to rent this and watch it again since it's been awhile and I couldn't remember how people were eliminated nor did I remember the challenges, so it was fun to watch again. But the BEST thing about the dvd set, is the commentary! If you couldn't stand Boston Rob through this season, you'll love the commentary! It was so great to hear other people voice their very open opinions of him that many of us viewers thought along the way. Are the losers bitter? Heck yeah...just like any of us would be when you look back in hind site. They all admit they were stupid for not seeing Rob and Amber being such a huge threat or rather ...they lacked the guts to break them up. If you hadn't seen it, you'll definitely find yourself yelling at the tv screen for the idiots to wake up. Anyways, its a fun season. Knowing who won, doesn't spoil it!

This set is the pinnacle of each of those things. There are deleted scenes on every disc, all 14 uncut exit interviews are included, commentaries on more than half of the episodes, and the seventh disc includes a plethora of bonuses that are far and away more than we've gotten on any of the other box sets. Even the America's Tribal Council live special is included. So why am I giving this only a four star rating? There's an episode missing. Given it's a recap episode and most of the scenes from it are featured in other episodes or deleted scenes, but still it makes for an incomplete watchthrough for hardcore completists such as myself. All of the other seasons that had recap episodes have had those episodes included on their respective box sets, so the exclusion of this one is rather bizarre, especially since there was an extra disc dedicated solely to bonus features. If you're a huge Survivor fan, and especially if this is one of your favorite seasons, buy this set.

831883,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B0002ERWV4,Paul Allaer,"[0, 0]","I am officially going through a Survivor re-appreciation phase. I recently ordered Season 1 (Borneo) as it was the only season I had never seen. After that I simply had to re-watch Season 2 (Australian Outback), which remains for me the best Survivor season ever. Then I turned my attention to Season 8 (All-Stars).""Survivor All-Stars: The Complete Season)(2004 release; 7 DVDs) reunites many familiar faces for the first time after 7 previous original casts. The names have been mentioned in many other reviews so no need for me to rehash all of them again. Just a couple of comments: first and foremost, Amber was a deserving winner. Looking back with almost 10 years hindsight, she was not just Boston Rob's hanger-on/eventual girlfriend. Amber was smart, likeable, lucky at times, but most of all simple very good (including several impressive wins at the challenges). Boston Rob is equally impressive, and in my opinion is the greatest Survivor player ever. The spat between Lex and Boston Rob (about Lex protecting Amber and then being voted of) became way too personal. It seems that Lex forgot that they were in a game to 'outwit, outlast and outplay' each other. Big Tom is equally the sore loser, and he wasn't even a great player to begin with. Watching the reunion show brought a smile to my face. Who can forget that Boston Rob proposed to Amber, even before the votes of the final Tribal Council were read? Like he said, ""no matter what happens, I've already won"". Hard to believe that it's been 9 years already since this season first aired on TV. (Did you know that Boston Rob and Amber are now the parents of three daughters?)In all, Survivor All-Stars is a delight to watch from start to finish for any serious fan of Survivor, and even for the mere casual fan of Survivor. It surely ranks as one of the top seasons in Survivor's rich TV history. Can't wait to see the new season in September!

Jensen,"[0, 0]","(Yes I know everyone else puts more spoilers and names in there reviews, this is just my style).Survivor All Stars is very interesting to watch, yet it makes you dissapointed in what is happening. As this season is full of contestants that previously, most of us liked or were fine with, we must all except that they are in different territory this time. New rules apply as everyone knows who the others are. As such voting strategies go all over the place, liability to the tribe, did they win, are they annoying, personal revenge, tribal lines, is it smart to take them?As the season progress the energy of the season never fully lets up, but our favorites play their cards: some leave early, some dissapoint, some are betrayed and some try to do what they did do, but aren't as sucessful, resulting in a mix of emotions for the season. Surprisingly quite a few of the filler people manage to carve themselves quite an impression in this season, and one of the worst two players, comes forwards to recreate his/her image and starts to become one of the game's best strategist's.The end of the season left many different vairables on who could win and one of the game's masterminds comes out on top. It was fun to watch, but you still can't over a few of our favorities doing what they did or how they went out. Out of all the old school seasons this remains as the worst season, that i like.However what we get with all these dyamic people is even more extra's on the dvds.

Ethan, Lex, and Tom from 'Africa'.  Jenna L, Rudy, and Sue from 'Borneo'.  Jenna M and Rob C from 'Amazon'.  Kathy and Rob M from 'Marquesas'.

Once you know this the element of surprise is gone forever.. How sad...Don't look at the pictures on front of every disk if you want surprises. If you don't care then you'll know who exactly get voted off with each disc and worse, you'll know who wins when you see them on the last sole disc.Otherwise, this show was GREAT!! and therefore gets 4 stars, but really zero stars for ruining the surprises. Fire that putz that decided to blow it for people that have not watched it. Me, one of them.The only other thing that was pathetic was the commentary by Lex, Kathy and Alicia who spend their valuable audio time on the bonus commentary bickering like teenagers over Boston Rob. Making ridiculous statements that Rob betrayed Lex etc. and that people were lying. Duh!!! The game is about outwitting, betraying, lying, and outsmarting everyone.

831892,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B0002ERWV4,trebe,"[11, 15]","When he decided to bring back 18 former contestants for Survivor All Stars, creator Rob Burnett thought he had another winning idea. The all star contestants picked were, Amber Brkich, Rob Mariano, Genna Lewis, Rupert Boneham, ""Big"" Tom Buchanan, Shiii Ann Huang, Alicia Calloway, Kathy Vavrick-O'brien, Lex Van Den Berghe, Jerri Manthey, Ethan Zohn, Colby Donaldson, Sue Hawk, Richard Hatch, Rob Cesternino, Jenna Morasca, Rudi Boesch, and Tina Wesson.  One may quibble with some of the selections, but these players were for the most part, among the more memorable or successful players of the game, including four past winners.  Despite some memorable twists and turns, All Stars turned out to be the `Rob and Amber' show.  The alliance turned romance not only `survived"", but produced a live on air proposal, with Amber then being named the sole survivor.Familiarity with the contestants makes All Stars a whole new game for both the players and the audience, with past winners targeted for early elimination.  Things proceed without any major bumps until Jenna M, in probably the most poignant Survivor moment ever, decides to bow out in order to be with her dying mother.  Then another surprise, when Sue also decides to quit, after being `traumatized' by Richard during a challenge.  Some pretty emotional stuff.The physical group challenges as usual, are very exciting and competitive.  It is painful to watch survivors get smacked down during the block puzzle.  The boat building challenge was another fun event.  The flag capture on the balance beams produced a number of thrilling spills, and fortunately no one was seriously injured.Other notable events include Richard's shark encounter, the very improbable tribal switch, where Amber was joined by all the members of the opposing tribe, the shelter building contest where Rupert encounters an immovable tree root, and Shii Ann's immunity challenge win.As the game progressed, Boston Rob and Amber formed more than an alliance.  Opportunities to breakup the power couple were not taken, and the pair took control.  Rob was criticized for his backstabbing ways, but he was not alone.  Colby was ousted thanks to Ethan's ploy, with Ethan in turn done in by his buddy Lex.  Richard was `bamboozled"" and sent packing, and ""Big' Tom was steaming mad after being completely blindsided.Like them or not, when the money was in `smelling' distance, Rob and Amber showed their true determination to win.  Rob M won the final immunity challenge, and Amber the second to the last.  Genna slit Rupert's line, only to have the shifting of her foot cost her a chance at a million dollars.  All this, leading up to an emotional final tribal council with the jury, where the sparks did fly.  The customary reunion show provided the platform for Rob's proposal to Amber, the announcement of the winner, and the usual recap.  The new twist was that the festivities were extended to a second program where Rupert was also awarded a million bucks, based on votes cast by the public.What really adds spice to the proceedings on DVD are the commentary tracks, which are quite revealing and inflammatory at times.  Early exiters Rob C, Jenna M, Rudy and Tina contributions are rather light hearted and fun.  The fireworks start when Lex, Kathy, Shii Ann, and Alicia get together with Boston Rob in their sights.  Their dislike for the `Robfather' is almost universal, with Genna L and Amber also on the hit list.  It's refreshing that we are allowed to hear some real shots taken.  Got to love the honesty.The final four of Rob M, Amber, Genna L and Rupert provide commentary for the last few episodes.  They have little to say about those they have outplayed, mainly focusing on themselves.  If you disliked any of them, the commentary probably won't change your mind, except maybe for Rupert.  Mr Tie Dye was clearly steamed with Genna after being voted out, but winning a million bucks in the popular vote transformed a fierce competitor into a satisfied pussycat, who has very little to say.Survivor has continued to be successful by evolving and keeping the game interesting.  Some may find that they way things played out this time, somewhat disappointing, but Survivor is after all, just a game.",4,The Robfather permutation . . .,1141776000,"03 8, 2006",2006,4241,"['When', 'decided', 'bring', 'back', '18', 'former', 'contestants', 'Survivor', 'All', 'Stars', 'creator', 'Rob', 'Burnett', 'thought', 'had', 'winning', 'idea', 'star', 'contestants', 'picked', 'were', 'Amber', 'Brkich', 'Rob', 'Mariano', 'Genna', 'Lewis', 'Rupert', 'Boneham', 'Big', 'Tom', 'Buchanan', 'Shiii', 'Ann', 'Huang', 'Alicia', 'Calloway', 'Kathy', ""Vavrick-O'brien"", 'Lex', 'Van', 'Den', 'Berghe', 'Jerri', 'Manthey', 'Ethan', 'Zohn', 'Colby', 'Donaldson', 'Sue', 'Hawk', 'Richard', 'Hatch', 'Rob', 'Cesternino', 'Jenna', 'Morasca', 'Rudi', 'Boesch', 'Tina', 'Wesson', 'One', 'may', 'quibble', 'selections', 'players', 'were', 'most', 'part', 'more', 'memorable', 'successful', 'players', 'game', 'including', 'four', 'past', 'winners', 'memorable', 'twists', 'turns', 'Stars', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'Rob', 'Amber', 'show', 'alliance', 'turned', 'romance', 'not', 'only', 'survived', 'produced', 'live', 'air', 'proposal', 'Amber', 'then', 'being', 'named', 'sole', 'survivor.Familiarity', 'contestants', 'Stars', 'whole', 'new', 'game', 'players', 'audience', 'past', 'winners', 'targeted', 'early', 'elimination', 'Things', 'proceed', 'major', 'bumps', 'Jenna', 'M', 'probably', 'most', 'poignant', 'Survivor', 'moment', 'ever', 'decides', 'bow', 'out', 'order', 'be', 'dying', 'mother', 'Then', 'surprise', 'when', 'Sue', 'also', 'quit', 'being', 'traumatized', 'Richard', 'challenge', 'pretty', 'emotional', 'stuff.The', 'physical', 'group', 'as', 'usual', 'are', 'very', 'exciting', 'competitive', 'painful', 'watch', 'survivors', 'get', 'smacked', 'down', 'block', 'puzzle', 'boat', 'building', 'challenge', 'was', 'fun', 'event', 'flag', 'capture', 'balance', 'beams', 'produced', 'number', 'thrilling', 'spills', 'fortunately', 'one', 'was', 'seriously', 'injured.Other', 'notable', 'events', 'include', 'Richard', 'shark', 'encounter', 'very', 'improbable', 'tribal', 'switch', 'where', 'Amber', 'was', 'joined', 'members', 'opposing', 'tribe', 'shelter', 'building', 'contest', 'where', 'Rupert', 'immovable', 'tree', 'root', 'Shii', 'Ann', 'immunity', 'challenge', 'win.As', 'game', 'progressed', 'Boston', 'Rob', 'Amber', 'formed', 'more', 'alliance', 'Opportunities', 'breakup', 'power', 'couple', 'were', 'not', 'taken', 'pair', 'took', 'control', 'Rob', 'was', 'criticized', 'backstabbing', 'ways', 'was', 'not', 'alone', 'Colby', 'was', 'ousted', 'thanks', 'Ethan', 'ploy', 'Ethan', 'turn', 'done', 'buddy', 'Lex', 'Richard', 'was', 'bamboozled', 'sent', 'packing', 'Big', 'Tom', 'was', 'steaming', 'mad', 'being', 'completely', 'not', 'when', 'money', 'was', 'smelling', 'distance', 'Rob', 'Amber', 'showed', 'true', 'determination', 'win', 'Rob', 'M', 'won', 'final', 'immunity', 'challenge', 'Amber', 'second', 'last', 'Genna', 'slit', 'Rupert', 'line', 'only', 'have', 'shifting', 'foot', 'cost', 'chance', 'million', 'dollars', 'leading', 'up', 'emotional', 'final', 'tribal', 'council', 'jury', 'where', 'sparks', 'did', 'fly', 'customary', 'reunion', 'show', 'provided', 'platform', 'Rob', 'proposal', 'Amber', 'announcement', 'winner', 'usual', 'recap', 'new', 'twist', 'was', 'festivities', 'were', 'extended', 'second', 'program', 'where', 'Rupert', 'was', 'also', 'awarded', 'million', 'bucks', 'based', 'votes', 'cast', 'public.What', 'really', 'spice', 'proceedings', 'DVD', 'are', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'are', 'quite', 'revealing', 'inflammatory', 'times', 'Early', 'exiters', 'Rob', 'C', 'Jenna', 'M', 'Rudy', 'Tina', 'contributions', 'are', 'rather', 'light', 'hearted', 'fun', 'fireworks', 'start', 'when', 'Lex', 'Kathy', 'Shii', 'Ann', 'Alicia', 'get', 'together', 'Boston', 'Rob', 'sights', 'dislike', 'Robfather', 'almost', 'universal', 'Genna', 'L', 'Amber', 'also', 'hit', 'list', 'refreshing', 'are', 'allowed', 'hear', 'real', 'shots', 'taken', 'Got', 'love', 'honesty.The', 'final', 'four', 'Rob', 'M', 'Amber', 'Genna', 'L', 'Rupert', 'provide', 'commentary', 'last', 'few', 'episodes', 'have', 'little', 'say', 'have', 'outplayed', 'mainly', 'focusing', 'disliked', 'commentary', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'change', 'mind', 'maybe', 'Rupert', 'Mr', 'Tie', 'Dye', 'was', 'clearly', 'steamed', 'Genna', 'being', 'voted', 'out', 'winning', 'million', 'bucks', 'popular', 'vote', 'transformed', 'fierce', 'competitor', 'satisfied', 'pussycat', 'who', 'very', 'little', 'say.Survivor', 'continued', 'be', 'successful', 'evolving', 'keeping', 'game', 'interesting', 'may', 'find', 'way', 'things', 'played', 'out', 'time', 'somewhat', 'disappointing', 'Survivor', 'just', 'game']",Survivor All-Stars - The Complete Season

831894,AP3B615GM191G,B0002ERWV4,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 1]","After seven mostly successful (some wildly so) seasons on the air, this eighth season of Survivor (an All-Star edition featuring all returning castaways) was a turning point in the show's history.  The reason?  It allowed the show producers to gauge whether or not interest in the franchise was still high.But before the philosophical stuff, this was simply just a great season of Survivor!  It earns every bit of its five star rating based on the high drama created by the already established ""characters"".  The preceding seven seasons of the show had introduced enough interesting personalities to completely whet the appetite of Survivor-holics, so the concept of the old favorites coming back was quite tantalizing.  Richard, Colby, Boston Rob, Rupert, & Lex all on the same island?  Survivor fans were all but screaming ""count me in!"".While I won't give away the ""meat"" of the season here, suffice it to say that it is filled with more emotion than perhaps any previous season.  Despite being a little shaky in the early goings (the ""three tribes"" thing was a bit awkward), once the season hits its midpoint it becomes as engrossing as any previous Survivor effort.Yet, despite the greatness of the season itself, ""All-Stars"" to me always represented a turning point in the Survivor franchise.  The ""rock and a hard place"" that Mark Burnett kept running up against was that the standard formula from the first four Survivors was bound to fail eventually.  Most people watching the show wanted the drama to continually escalate, so the only way to do that was to insert more ""gags"" and contrived drama into the proceedings, a fact that is quite obvious in seasons 5-7 (Johnny Fairplay, anyone?).  With All-Stars, though, Burnett learned that he still had a core following after eight seasons (a rare feat in television).Personally, I consider ""All-Stars"" to be the last truly ""original"" Survivor series of the bunch (now numbering into the mid-20s in terms of seasons).  Original in terms of how the show was initially conceived and not including the goofiness that can be seen in the franchise especially of late.Thus, while the season itself is spectacular, ""All-Stars' will always stand out as a sort of transition period for the franchise, a ""goodbye"", if you will, to the core notions of the show and the ushering in of a more ""jacked up"", drama-laden, sometimes even goofy series.  For that reason, ""All-Stars"" is even a bit more special to me, personally.",5,A Turning Point,1360627200,"02 12, 2013",2013,2466,"['seven', 'mostly', 'successful', 'wildly', 'so', 'seasons', 'air', 'eighth', 'season', 'Survivor', 'All-Star', 'edition', 'featuring', 'returning', 'castaways', 'was', 'turning', 'point', 'show', 'history', 'reason', 'allowed', 'show', 'producers', 'gauge', 'not', 'interest', 'franchise', 'was', 'still', 'high.But', 'philosophical', 'stuff', 'was', 'simply', 'just', 'great', 'season', 'Survivor', 'bit', 'five', 'star', 'rating', 'based', 'high', 'drama', 'created', 'already', 'established', 'characters', 'preceding', 'seven', 'seasons', 'show', 'had', 'introduced', 'enough', 'interesting', 'personalities', 'completely', 'whet', 'appetite', 'Survivor-holics', 'concept', 'old', 'favorites', 'coming', 'back', 'was', 'quite', 'tantalizing', 'Richard', 'Colby', 'Boston', 'Rob', 'Rupert', 'Lex', 'same', 'island', 'Survivor', 'fans', 'were', 'screaming', 'count', '.While', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'meat', 'season', 'here', 'say', 'filled', 'more', 'emotion', 'perhaps', 'previous', 'season', 'being', 'little', 'shaky', 'early', 'goings', 'three', 'tribes', 'thing', 'was', 'bit', 'awkward', 'once', 'season', 'midpoint', 'as', 'engrossing', 'previous', 'Survivor', 'effort.Yet', 'greatness', 'season', 'All-Stars', 'always', 'represented', 'turning', 'point', 'Survivor', 'franchise', 'rock', 'hard', 'place', 'Mark', 'Burnett', 'kept', 'running', 'up', 'was', 'standard', 'formula', 'first', 'four', 'Survivors', 'was', 'bound', 'fail', 'eventually', 'Most', 'people', 'watching', 'show', 'wanted', 'drama', 'continually', 'escalate', 'only', 'way', 'do', 'was', 'insert', 'more', 'gags', 'contrived', 'drama', 'proceedings', 'fact', 'quite', 'obvious', 'seasons', '5-7', 'Johnny', 'Fairplay', 'anyone', 'All-Stars', 'Burnett', 'learned', 'still', 'had', 'core', 'following', 'eight', 'seasons', 'rare', 'feat', 'television', '.Personally', 'consider', 'All-Stars', 'be', 'last', 'truly', 'original', 'Survivor', 'series', 'bunch', 'now', 'numbering', 'mid-20s', 'terms', 'seasons', 'Original', 'terms', 'how', 'show', 'was', 'initially', 'conceived', 'not', 'including', 'goofiness', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'franchise', 'especially', 'late.Thus', 'season', 'spectacular', 'All-Stars', 'will', 'always', 'stand', 'out', 'sort', 'transition', 'period', 'franchise', 'goodbye', 'will', 'core', 'notions', 'show', 'ushering', 'more', 'jacked', 'up', 'drama-laden', 'sometimes', 'even', 'goofy', 'series', 'reason', 'All-Stars', 'even', 'bit', 'more', 'special', 'personally']",Survivor All-Stars - The Complete Season
