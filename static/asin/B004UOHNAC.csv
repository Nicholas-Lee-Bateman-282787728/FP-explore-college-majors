Lancaster was never really a studio player so his films are spread all over - his best work was primarily at United Artists though.

Local Hero and Seven Days in May are excellent films that were on DVD but are now long out of print.

It includes the stellar but somewhat obscure Seven Days in May directed by Frankenheimer. Frankenheimer directed Seven Days in May on the heels of his highly lauded political/military/psychological thriller, The Manchurian Candidate. If you never thought a coup in the US was possible, well, Frankenheimer should have had you at thinking at least twice about it. While The Manchurian Candidate (not in this collection) explored secret psychological brainwashing, political intrigue, treason, and assasination methods to achieve that end, Seven Days in May explores direct military takeover motivated by political adversarial disagreements by the military and a large percentage of the public with the administration. Not a word in the script, set object, or visual scene is wasted. Not a gesture, vocal inflection, or detail of body languange is accidental. Rod Serling wrote the screen play and script, with music by Jerry Goldsmith, and drection by John Frankenheimer. The cast is a who's who of stars and supporting character actors/actresses, the mixture of which with the outstanding script and direction is the reason why Seven Days in May gets 100% on Rotten Tomatoes.No equivocation here. Senator Prentice to (USMC) Colonel Casey: &#34;But you make me think that the fruit salad on your chest is for neutrality, evasiveness, and fence-straddling.&#34; Colonel Casey to Senator Prentice: &#34;On the contrary, Senator, they're standard awards for cocktail courage and dinner-table heroism. I thought you'd invented them.&#34; Even in the midst of equivocation, there isn't any.All The rest of the films show Burt Lancaster in good roles and show off his range over time in a variety of roles. Every one is a gem in its own right. The genres vary substantially so they may not all be any one persons favorites. Nevertheless, if you ever wanted a brief collection showing Burt Lancaster at his best, these are certainly four of the best.True to form, TMC (Turner Classic Movies) treats each one well in the transfers. The packagng is a nice standard DVD case with four DVDs, one for each film. No flippers here. They share one stacked spindle but the center of each disk is thicker than the surface, so with simple reasonable care, they will not harm each other.",5,"ECOMCON and ""Yes, I know who Judas was.

Not the finest movie of it's type but more than entertaining. This ofcourse brings us to Executive Action, one of the early films in the long list of films talking of the JFK assination. Found the story fun and entertaining with interesting plot points,only real problem is I do not buy into the hole conspiracy thing. A good yarn with a good cast and great preformances also interesting special features.Seven Days In May by far the best film in the colection and is worth the price of the entire set.
