1213847,A2582KMXLK2P06,B001L8YQ64,B. E Jackson,"[1, 2]","Gardens of the Night is a film that deals with the unfortunate circumstance involving a little girl going to school who happens to be the victim of a man who decides to kidnap her.  There's a sad kind of build up that happens in the kidnapping process that shows what's about to happen to the girl as soon as she makes the choice to get inside that car.This of course, changes the girls life drastically, because she's too small to run away from the guy for fear of her life (even though the guy acted very polite towards the girl and treated her like he would his own daughter, he definitely had his issues obviously) and she's too small to do anything other than cry, be afraid, and feel a dreaded sense of uncertainty.Now the poor girl has to live with the guy who kidnapped her along with another man who had a serious attitude problem.  I think the other man was someone who was kidnapped many years before and grew up respecting the guy like a father.While living with these two guys, the little girl soon realizes there's another boy around her age living with them, and the little girl becomes friends with the boy.  The friendship they develop sticks with them for many years, well into their adult life.This movie is shocking to me because kidnapping is an unfortunate and horrible (and downright frightening) thing that happens in reality, and the film shows it from the perspective of the little girl who is kidnapped.Gardens of the Night will have you wondering and attached to your TV screen anticipating what will happen next for the poor little girl.The ending of the movie is spectacular and made me cry a little bit.  I kind of knew it was coming, but it still hit me pretty hard.  You really feel for the girl the entire time and want her to pull through all the obstacles that lay before her.  Will she survive?  You'll have to find out.",5,great movie,1248307200,"07 23, 2009",2009,1857,"['Gardens', 'Night', 'film', 'unfortunate', 'circumstance', 'involving', 'little', 'girl', 'going', 'school', 'who', 'be', 'victim', 'man', 'who', 'kidnap', 'sad', 'kind', 'build', 'kidnapping', 'process', 'what', 'about', 'happen', 'girl', 'as', 'soon', 'choice', 'get', 'car.This', 'course', 'girls', 'life', 'drastically', 'too', 'small', 'run', 'away', 'guy', 'fear', 'life', 'even', 'guy', 'acted', 'very', 'polite', 'girl', 'treated', 'would', 'own', 'daughter', 'definitely', 'had', 'issues', 'obviously', 'too', 'small', 'do', 'anything', 'other', 'cry', 'be', 'afraid', 'feel', 'dreaded', 'sense', 'uncertainty.Now', 'poor', 'girl', 'live', 'guy', 'who', 'kidnapped', 'along', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'serious', 'attitude', 'problem', 'think', 'other', 'man', 'was', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'kidnapped', 'many', 'years', 'grew', 'up', 'respecting', 'guy', 'father.While', 'living', 'two', 'guys', 'little', 'girl', 'soon', 'boy', 'age', 'living', 'little', 'girl', 'becomes', 'friends', 'boy', 'friendship', 'develop', 'sticks', 'many', 'years', 'well', 'adult', 'life.This', 'movie', 'shocking', 'kidnapping', 'unfortunate', 'horrible', 'downright', 'frightening', 'thing', 'reality', 'film', 'perspective', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'kidnapped.Gardens', 'Night', 'will', 'have', 'wondering', 'attached', 'TV', 'screen', 'anticipating', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'poor', 'little', 'girl.The', 'ending', 'movie', 'spectacular', 'made', 'cry', 'little', 'bit', 'kind', 'knew', 'was', 'coming', 'still', 'hit', 'pretty', 'hard', 'really', 'feel', 'girl', 'entire', 'time', 'want', 'pull', 'obstacles', 'lay', 'Will', 'survive', ""'ll"", 'have', 'find', 'out']",Gardens of the Night

Wong,"[2, 6]","Saw this film recently on Showtime and it was based on the fact that John Malkovich was in it but unfortunately it is primarily a cameo of about 10 minutes of screen time.  The kidnapping of a little girl from her San Diego home was harrowing to say the least and the acting from Tom Arnold as the abductor and Jeremy Sisto, Harold Perrineau as his confederates was also very good but the film just dragged on to its dismal conclusion.  I often wonder what the filmmakers intent was to have such an un resolved ending?  I was hoping that the female, now a teenager would slowly be indoctrinated back into her family.  What's also missing from this disappointing film is that we are not shown what the abductors did when she reached the teen age or how she was dumped back into society.

1213851,A3MYY88NLEJ8Y3,B001L8YQ64,Diane Moore,"[0, 0]","GARDENS OF THE NIGHT starts out in this picture perfect neighborhood, as seven year old Leslie walks by herself to school. Alex (played by Tom Arnold) approaches her and asks her to help him find his dog, Trixie. Because he knows how to manipulate and ask the right questions, he gets Leslie to believe that not only does he know her dad, but he is actually Alex's boss. His plan seems to work, because he is able to get her to trust him enough to drop her off at school. Hours later, he is accompanied by Frank (who would appear to be his son) and as she is leaving school, they tell her that her dad has an ""emergency,"" and makes her come with them. She appears to be drugged by the soda that she drinks, because she then sleeps for hours on end. They take her to a house, where she meets Donnie, who appears to be in the same situation that she is in.This movie is very difficult to watch, as it deals with kidnapping and child prostitution. My skin was crawling as I watched Jimmy (played by Jeremy Sisto) giving Alex a photo album to look through, containing pictures of hundreds of solicited children. He explains that the client may come to them, or the child may have to fly to another part of the country, in which he would go with the child. The only light at the end of the tunnel for Leslie is that she and Donnie become connected in a way that they love and take care of each other. They agree to meet in a special place if they are ever separated from each other.As they get older, you see that they are still together, but their lives are rough, and you wonder if they will ever find their families, or any kind of happiness again. I cried a lot while watching this, especially at the end.Though the movie is well edited, sometimes it's a little too close for comfort. There are also a lot of unanswered questions.

I guess my problem is the story itself. It certainly isn't fun to watch. I know there are people out there doing the things that are done in this movie, but I don't need to see it.A young girl gets kidnapped by a man (well played by Tom Arnold) and his buddy who first use her in internet child porn and then for prostitution. This is scary and painful to watch. What makes it tougher to view is the Tom Arnold character. He isn't a nasty, mean, drooling individual. He does seem to care for her at some level, and you get the hint his upbringing wasn't very joyous so he's not so easy to write off. He has also kidnapped a young African American boy for the same purposes and these two kids realize they are all they have and form a bond.You skip ahead some 10 years or so and the two (Leslie and Frank) are still together. But now the Tom Arnold character and his buddy are gone and the kids are on the streets. They smoke, drink, do drugs and turn tricks. The people they hang with are the same. It's an ugly realization.Through her trying to get into a shelter, the administrator, played by John Malkovich, finds out who she is and is able to send her home and reunite her with her family. I won't spoil it for you but let's say that Hollywood is no where to be found here.Again. This is good.

Even harder than Holly (also trailered on this DVD).The story follows a young, upper-middle class girl (played incredibly by Ryan Simpkins, who coincidentally blew me away with her brief adult-style performance in Balls Out) as she is lured by a pedophile into an irreversible life of long term abuse and abandonment. The film flashes between her youth and later adult existence on the streets. No part of this topic is easy to watch, but everyone plays their roles adequately. Tom Arnold is absolutely scary as the pedophile, he was completely believable to the extreme.The video and sound quality were fine, and the supplements cover the array of related topics. The deleted scenes were thankfully cut out (even more graphic), but it did show the obvious confusion towards the end of the film in the writing and editing. Malkovich and Sisto already had abbreviated parts, but as I was watching the end Michelle Rodriguez' part seemed strangely miscut, but then left in the deleted scenes, as were the alternate parent actors' roles. The credit listings supplement to help people learn about this topic were too ""edgy"" and distracting, it could have been made more straightforward and a great deal clearer.An important awareness content film, hardly rewatchable, a few faults here and there, but the two performances of the main girl are worthy of acknowledgment.",4,"Tough, not sure how else to summarize",1237593600,"03 21, 2009",2009,1547,"['parent', 'understand', 'importance', 'content', 'regarding', 'children', 'being', 'kidnapped', 'domestically', 'ending', 'up', 'lost', 'sex/slave', 'rings', 'man', 'was', 'difficult', 'watch', 'Even', 'harder', 'Holly', 'also', 'trailered', 'DVD', '.The', 'story', 'young', 'upper-middle', 'class', 'girl', 'played', 'incredibly', 'Ryan', 'Simpkins', 'who', 'coincidentally', 'blew', 'away', 'brief', 'adult-style', 'performance', 'Balls', 'Out', 'lured', 'pedophile', 'irreversible', 'life', 'long', 'term', 'abuse', 'abandonment', 'film', 'flashes', 'youth', 'later', 'adult', 'existence', 'streets', 'part', 'topic', 'easy', 'watch', 'everyone', 'roles', 'adequately', 'Tom', 'Arnold', 'absolutely', 'scary', 'pedophile', 'was', 'completely', 'believable', 'extreme.The', 'video', 'sound', 'quality', 'were', 'fine', 'supplements', 'cover', 'array', 'related', 'topics', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'were', 'thankfully', 'cut', 'out', 'even', 'more', 'graphic', 'did', 'show', 'obvious', 'confusion', 'end', 'film', 'writing', 'editing', 'Malkovich', 'Sisto', 'already', 'had', 'abbreviated', 'parts', 'was', 'watching', 'end', 'Michelle', 'Rodriguez', 'part', 'seemed', 'strangely', 'miscut', 'then', 'left', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'were', 'alternate', 'parent', 'actors', 'roles', 'credit', 'listings', 'supplement', 'help', 'people', 'learn', 'topic', 'were', 'too', 'edgy', 'distracting', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'more', 'straightforward', 'great', 'deal', 'clearer.An', 'important', 'awareness', 'content', 'film', 'hardly', 'rewatchable', 'few', 'faults', 'here', 'there', 'two', 'performances', 'main', 'girl', 'are', 'worthy', 'acknowledgment']",Gardens of the Night

Having said that, it certainly has a bleak ending.  It certainly left an impact on me.Tom Arnold proves he can stand on his own and is much more than an extension of Roseanne.  I'm glad because he seems like a good guy except in character in this movie, but even that is a dichotomy......he seems protective and fatherly to his captives although he exploits them.  What great acting!Movie deals with a serious subject matter and is a must see by parents.  It is not an exploitive movie.  However, while actions are more suggested than shown (which is one of the reasons this is an excellent movie), it still should not be seen with the kids.  Parents, watch the movie and then discuss it separately with your children.",5,Just because you don't like the subject matter doesn't make it a bad movie,1399593600,"05 9, 2014",2014,855,"['Definitely', 'not', 'lame', 'Hollywood', 'blockbuster', 'production', 'Certainly', 'not', 'movie', 'meant', 'enjoy', 'as', 'much', 'leave', 'impact', 'Having', 'said', 'certainly', 'bleak', 'ending', 'certainly', 'left', 'impact', 'me.Tom', 'Arnold', 'can', 'stand', 'own', 'much', 'more', 'extension', 'Roseanne', ""'m"", 'glad', 'good', 'guy', 'character', 'movie', 'even', 'dichotomy', 'protective', 'fatherly', 'captives', 'What', 'great', 'acting', 'Movie', 'deals', 'serious', 'subject', 'matter', 'must', 'see', 'parents', 'not', 'exploitive', 'movie', 'However', 'actions', 'are', 'more', 'suggested', 'shown', 'one', 'reasons', 'excellent', 'movie', 'still', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'seen', 'kids', 'Parents', 'watch', 'movie', 'then', 'discuss', 'separately', 'children']",Gardens of the Night
