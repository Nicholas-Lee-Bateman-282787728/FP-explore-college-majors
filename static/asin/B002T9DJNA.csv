1287890,A20FK68BUB1IVA,B002T9DJNA,Happy Reader,"[9, 9]","This is Set Six of eleven ""Inspector Morse"" Sets. Each Set has three episodes/discs. Don't confuse these eleven ""Sets"" with the previously issued (but still available) ""Collection Sets"". Each of the six ""Collection Sets"" cost more, as each has more episodes/discs than these Sets.Set Six has three episodes, first aired in February and March of 1991. Originally, they were the first three episodes, in the same order, in the BBC Series 5. (The English use the term ""series"" instead of ""seasons"".)Episodes:Second Time AroundFat ChanceWho Killed Harry FieldSECOND TIME AROUND:Charlie Hillian is retiring from the Thames Valley police force and writing a book. They give him a big send-off party and Charlie drinks too much. Chief Inspector Patrick Dawson used to be at Thames Valley. He and his wife came down from London to see Charlie off into retirement. Not having drunk quite as much, they take Charlie home after the party, and settle him on the couch before leaving for their hotel.The next morning, Mrs. Keelan, Charlie's housekeeper, finds poor Charlie on the floor, dead, a window broken and the desk rifled. Morse and Lewis are on the case, but Dawson begs to be allowed to help, knowing it's not his jurisdiction. What can Morse do but say ""Yes"" - everybody is furious that one of their own, and a popular one at that, was struck down.It looks like this is not a simple burglary gone wrong. The only thing missing is the chapter of Charlie's book that covered an unsolved murder from years before. There are numerous suspects, and this well-told tale has a surprise and a little heartbreak that I didn't see coming.Trivia: This episode was written by Daniel Boyle, based on the characters created by Colin Dexter. Dexter's walk-on is where he's in the background at the Trout Inn when Morse meets Barbara Redpath.  This episode has a lovely small part for Sam Kelly, who plays Walter Majors, Charlie's ghostwriter, with metaphysical rumpledness.In ""The Story of Morse"", a 50 minute documentary special, John Thaw says this about his character, Morse: ""The puzzle of solving a murder is what sort of drives him on. And when that's gone and he's solved that particular clue, then he's back to reality. And he doesn't like the reality of it. I think that's probably why he drinks. More than most.""FAT CHANCE:Back to Oxford college for this episode. Victoria, her arm in a sling, is sitting for her Divinity Examination. She is dressed in a cleric's black robe as a political statement. She is a member of The PAX Group, headed by Hilary Dobson, a group working towards women's ordination in the Church of England. In the middle of her exam, Veronica stands up, obviously unwell, and falls to the floor dead.She's been poisoned, and the first question for Morse and Lewis is, how was she poisoned? She took communion just before the test, administered by a chaplain and priest virulently opposed to the goals of the PAX Group. The priest, Jeffry, rifled her room while she was at the exam. Was Victoria killed because of her promise? She was expected to do excellently on the exam.But a Morse murder can't be that simple! PAX runs a hostel for young women, where Victoria was counselor to the troubled and overweight Dinah. Dinah has gone into hiding. She had been taking part in the trial of an experimental weight-loss supplement at a local fat farm.  Mr. Gold, odious owner of the spa, asks his pet scientist, Hank, ""You say the fat woman's on the loose again?""  Hank: ""Who listens to fat women? Especially when they have no evidence.""Trivia: ""Fat Chance"" was written by Alma Cullen, based on characters created by Colin Dexter. Dexter's walk-on is where he is on the college grounds when Hilary goes in for her interview with the chaplain. This episode seems ahead of it's time, with it's commentary on body image.WHO KILLED HARRY FIELD?:Harry Field is in his commodious studio, surrounded by paintings finished and unfinished, starting his second bottle of booze. Someone calls, but doesn't leave a message. Someone drives up, but leaves without knocking. We find, after a couple scenes, that good old Harry irritates a lot of people.A few days later, Morse and Lewis are called to the scene near a bridge. It's the body of a man with no identification, but the keys for a motorcycle (not found at the scene) and paint under his nails. When they figure out it's Harry, Morse and Lewis visit the studio. Morse is contemplative, maybe because he's been having trouble sleeping: ""Here we are again, Lewis. Putting together the last moments of a complete stranger's life. Showing more concern for him than we would when he was alive.""The next day, in one of my favorite scenes ever, Lewis gets into the office to find Morse positively chirpy. He's holding heraldry plaques and plans from Harry's studio. Morse laughs, ""I think I might have got on with Harry Field!"" He reads from a plaque,"" 'Ventosa Vere Restabit'. That's translated by Harry for a Mr. and Mrs. Parker of Ohio as 'Springtime brings respite from wintery storms.' Of course, in Latin, the letter V is pronounced W. Therefore this motto would read 'When toes are weary, rest a bit.'""  And Morse GIGGLES! He explains to a puzzled Lewis, ""He was making it up! Joke genealogy. Heraldry. Seems Harry had a sideline.""Then they find out that Harry had a dark side, too.Trivia: This episode was written by Geoffry Case, based on the characters created by Colin Dexter. Dexter's walk-on is where he appears in a group of people present when Ian Matthews presents Morse with a pertinent postcard. Excellent acting, including Geraldine James as Harry's wife, Helen. It's in this episode that Lewis first broaches the subject of trying for a promotion.",5,Intelligent Intriguing Murder Mysteries!,1337212800,"05 17, 2012",2012,5712,"['Set', 'Six', 'eleven',

1287898,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B002T9DJNA,Z Hayes,"[0, 0]","I came to the Inspector Morse series by way of Inspector Lewis, and discovered that Kevin Whately (who is amazing as DI Lewis) also used to play DS Lewis in Inspector Morse. He is one of my favorite actors, and of course, John Thaw is one of my all-time favorite actors in investigative dramas. Thaw's Morse is compelling to watch - he loves listening to operatic music, enjoys his quality pint of ale, is easily smitten by a pretty face and intelligence, and is meticulous and astute in his deductive reasoning. All in all, Morse exemplifies the consummate detective, and most of the Morse episodes are of superior quality in terms of writing and acting.Set Six contains three episodes:Second Time AroundIn ""Second Time Around"", a retired senior police officer is found murdered, possibly linked to the fact that the victim was about to publish his memoirs. One significant chapter appears to be missing, regarding a cold case involving the murder of a young child many years ago. Could the deceased's murder and the cold case be linked, and were both killings done by the same person? Morse struggles to puzzle the case out, and his life is made more complicated by the involvement of another senior officer and former rival, Chief Insp Dawson. Things are also not helped by DS Lewis, whose second guessing of Morse's theories rile the methodical Morse.The story flowed seamlessly, which is a trademark of this series (although there have been clunkers). I was literally holding my breath at certain key points of the story, waiting to see if Morse's theory would pan out, and if so, in which direction. I could watch this episode over and over again!Fat ChanceThe plot is ludicrous here - on the one hand, there's a suspicious death of a female deacon destined for great things (she dies in the midst of sitting an important examination). Morse and Lewis soon discover an undercurrent of Oxford politics between the clerics who approve of change in the form of a female chaplain (would be a first for one of the colleges), and those who are vehemently against it. This plot arc also sees Morse getting attracted to a female cleric, Emma.The second story arc is what jumbles the plot - there's a young woman under the care of Emma who appears to know something about the death and has gone missing. She is shown throughout the story, running around, grabbing people, and shouting like a crazy woman. These outbursts are tenuously linked to a pharmaceutical company manufacturing slimming pills. At this point, I no longer cared what happened to these secondary characters, and the only reason I watched it till the end was because of Morse. Even the romance bit did not seem altogether credible, and frankly Morse appeared bored throughout the story. I'd give this a miss as there are other, highly superior Morse episodes than this drivel.Who Killed Harry Field?This episode will interest those who are keen on art history, though I admit I felt a little underwhelmed by the resolution. When the body of an artist named Harry Field is found, Morse and Lewis are assigned the case. They find the artist's studio to be a mess with slashed paintings. Field's wife has not seen him in a week and later Morse and Lewis discover that Field may have been involved in some underhanded dealings involving forging famous paintings.
