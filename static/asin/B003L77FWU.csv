While enjoying the 3rd series using my Prime account, I ran across 2 episodes that require payment to view (numbers 11 and 16, Long Way Home and Triumverate). I contacted A m a z o n and they are working the problem. In the very unusual event that they do not have rights to stream those 2 episodes, which I find not likely ... then they will have to be purchased. Anyway... I will keep an eye on it and remove reference to it from this writing when they fix it. The Amanda King character seems to show some growth in this season. It's important to keep the changes slow and steady or the series gets stagnant. On the other hand, if she radically changes, or her family dynamic becomes complicated, the series loses its romantic tension.

The quality of the discs are great! They are on single-sided discs, which was VERY nice because double-sided discs oftentimes have quality issues/playback issues. The only thing that is missing from a DVD collection like this is special features. I was also a fan of Remington Steele and a few other '80's shows and those shows added interviews with the cast members and production crews, as well as some behind the scenes footage. Seeing as almost all of the core members of the SMK cast are still alive, this could have been done, as well. HOWEVER, seeing as we had to sign petitions to get the seasons put on DVD, I'm grateful to have the show!The characters and plots were great, as well. At this point in the series, Amanda is a permanent fixture on The Agency's roster, and she and Lee are getting closer - personally speaking.

1349845,AAHGPDGEDRVEN,B003L77FWU,"Tracy Christenson ""dictionary enchantress""","[0, 0]","The Scarecrow and Mrs. King is a wonderful mix of action, adventure, mystery, comedy, and romance.In the first season of the show, Lee Stetson, a secret agent codenamed ""Scarecrow"" working for an organization in the Washington D.C. area known only as the ""Agency"" finds himself in a tough spot and is forced to ask a civilian, Mrs. King, to deliver a package for him.  Although Amanda King, divorced mother of two boys, is unable to deliver the package as Lee asked, she ends up helping him to solve the case he's working on and joins the Agency herself.  She becomes Lee's friend and partner, and later, the two of them fall in love.  The romantic side of their relationship becomes more obvious in the third season than in the first two.  Although they don't explicitly state that they're in love, they show it in the way that the two of them interact, and their interest in each other increases throughout the season.  In the last episode of the season, Lee tells Amanda that he wants to get to know her better before kissing her.Amanda is much more experienced at being an agent in season 3, although she still has her eccentricities and unorthodox ways of pursuing the cases they work on.  All the moments of comedy are still there, and Amanda is still keeping her career as a spy secret from her family, so she still has to come up with excuses to explain away the strange things going on around them while keeping them safe from the bad guys.The episodes in season 3 are:1. A Lovely Little Affair - Amanda is assigned to keep an eye on an art restorer who is participating in a scheme to free his kidnapped sister.  Not knowing that Amanda works for the Agency, he develops romantic feelings for her.2. We're Off to See the Wizard - The past comes back to haunt Lee when some of his old female associates and girlfriends are murdered.  The murders are connected to the death of a female agent Lee loved years ago when he first got the name Scarecrow.3. Over the Limit - A simple grassroots effort by local fishermen to stop big companies from fishing over the limit turns into a nightmare when a Congressman is blown up at a rally.  Amanda is a witness to the bombing and is determined to prove that the woman accused of it is innocent.4. Tail of the Dancing Weasel - Amanda is put in the awkward position of spying on Lee when the founder of the Agency asks her to keep an eye on him because the case he is investigating threatens to expose the founder's identity as a triple agent.5. Welcome to America, Mr. Brand - An MI6 accountant who likes to play spy convinces Amanda that he has discovered a conspiracy that threatens U.S. currency.6. Sour Grapes - When three important men who are all members of the same wine lovers' society are poisoned with heroin-laced wine, Lee and Amanda go undercover to find the source of the heroin.7. Utopia Now - Lee and Amanda are sent to find a missing agent and find out that the tax reformer the agent was investigating is a much more sinister character than they imagined with his own wilderness community and militia.8. Reach for the Sky - Billy, Lee's boss at the Agency, goes rogue to investigate the murder of an old friend of his.  Lee and Amanda try to find him and help him.9. J. Edgar's Ghost - Lee and Amanda learn that some of J. Edgar Hoover's personal files containing damaging information about important people still exist when someone starts using them as blackmail to get government secrets.10. Flight to Freedom - Lee and Amanda search for a journalist who was supposedly killed while covering unrest in a Central American country.  He may have made it back to the U.S. alive, but if so, he is in danger from assassins who want to keep him from testifying against corrupt politicians.11. The Wrong Way Home - Amanda's ex-husband, Joe, reappears in Amanda's life as a suspect in a political assassination, and Lee insists on pursuing the investigation personally.12 . Fast Food for Thought - An old colleague of Lee's is almost killed after trying to warn Lee about something dangerous involving a chain of fast food restaurants.  Lee and Amanda pose as a brother/sister team at an orientation meeting for people wanting to open a franchise.13. One Bear Dances, One Bear Doesn't - Amanda's mother, Dotty, has been reading romance novels about women who fall in love with foreign dissidents, so when Amanda is assigned to befriend a Russian defector now living in her neighborhood, Dotty can't help but be swept up in the romance of it.14. Playing for Keeps - While Amanda has a cold, Lee and Francine have to protect a spoiled tennis star from assassination.15. The Pharaoh's Engineer - Some of the people living at the Agency's retirement home have become targets for someone investigating an early project of the Agency.16. The Triumvirate - Amanda becomes the target of a secret group of assassins within the government when a check for one of them is accidentally switched for her regular paycheck.17. The Eyes Have It - A set of contact lenses containing information about civilians who help the Agency is stolen directly out of Lee's eyes after he's been in a car accident.18. Wrong Number - Amanda is running a security check on a mathematician, but someone is trying to make it look like he is actually an enemy agent.19. The Boy Who Could Be King - The jazz-loving king of a tiny country with only one important natural resource has come to the U.S. to find his long-lost son, unaware that the boy is a target for assassination.20. Dead Men Leave No Trails - A simple parking lot accident turns into a manhunt when Amanda tries to return the excess money paid to her by the man who hit her car and learns that he is a terrorist that the Agency believed was dead.21. Three Little Spies - Someone is smuggling detonators in shipments of food to needy countries.  In order to stop them, Lee must work with Russian and Chinese agents with Amanda reminding them all to put aside their distrust to focus on the job at hand.22.
