In recent years for some silly reason that I don't get, the media has tried to damage Liza's artistic credibility but it doesn't work when Liza takes to the stage and shows sold out audiences with her soulful singing and great performing skills what she is all about and that she is and always will be a true legendary Superstar...numerous standing ovations later it is clear that Liza is going to be around for a long time to come and this tremendous concert is a keeper...BRAVO Liza and keep on rocking!!!",5,LEGENDARY PERFORMANCE~BRAVO LIZA MINNELLI !!!,1164240000,"11 23, 2006",2006,908,"['legendary', 'mother', 'nobody', 'today', 'command', 'stage', 'Liza', 'Minnelli', 'legendary', 'event', 'New', 'York', 'Radio', 'City', 'Music', 'Hall', 'clearly', 'always', 'five', 'star', 'event', 'concert', 'have', 'been', 'fortunate', 'experience', 'thrilling', 'amazing', 'performer', 'numerous', 'times', 'concert', '1970', '2005', 'am', 'here', 'say', 'still', 'got', 'always', 'will', 'recent', 'years', 'silly', 'reason', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'media', 'tried', 'damage', 'Liza', 'artistic', 'credibility', ""n't"", 'work', 'when', 'Liza', 'stage', 'shows', 'sold', 'out', 'audiences', 'soulful', 'singing', 'great', 'performing', 'skills', 'what', 'always', 'will', 'be', 'true', 'legendary', 'Superstar', 'numerous', 'standing', 'ovations', 'later', 'clear', 'Liza', 'going', 'be', 'around', 'long', 'time', 'come', 'tremendous', 'concert', 'keeper', 'BRAVO', 'Liza', 'keep', 'rocking']",Liza Minnelli: Live From Radio City Music Hall

1011276,A21TOHGBXLPVZU,B000H7JCIW,D.J.L,"[2, 2]","Liza shines in this wonderful created concert/Special. One thing I really like about this DVD is that its not Liza trying to re-record her greatest hits. In this concert, she did yes, sing some of her classic hits. But most of the material sung in this concert where not typical Liza songs. Such examples would be ""Live Alone and Like It"", ""So What"", ""Sara Lee"", and ""The Men's Medley"" were all new great new songs for Liza to introduce into her songbook.Their were although some things that I didn't like about this performance. I felt that at some spots through out the first act Liza is singing so low, and backing away from the power of the song's moment, and it becomes hard for you to understand what she is trying to sing. In other words you could say at some parts she seems to mumble. But through the second act she was totally fine, due to most of the songs in the second act were uptempo; Which brings me to my next pint.Most of the songs in the First act were ballads. Their is absolutely nothing wrong with ballads, but In my opinion I think the first Act should have been longer, and started out with more up-tempos. Then after about maybe four up-tempos, then go into a pattern of ballads and up-tempos. Instead of doing ballads straight in a row. Like how the first act did at some points.As for the second act, I think it was perfect. Especially for the Men's Medley, Liza and her dancer did a great job of incorporating so many different types of songs into this medley. The one thing I Did not like about the second act is this whole Bob Fosse, Imagine, Smile medley thing. I'm glad it wasn't in Liza With a Z because I felt it dragged on for way too long. It looked like Liza and her dancers were doing a very bad imitation of Liza's performance of Bye, Bye, Blackbird in Liza with a Z. Besides that, the second act was perfect. Some great songs were the ""Here I'll Stay Medley"" and ""The Man I Love""I would DEFIANTLY recommend this to any Liza, Broadway, of showtunes fan. It is full or great numbers, and terrific dances.",4,Great!

1011278,A1IGHPYFKEAQH9,B000H7JCIW,E. Valdes,"[13, 14]","This concert took place shortly before Liza's health started to rapidly decline.  It looks as if she wanted to leave a final testimony of what she could achieve while she was still at the top of her game.  This should be a must-see for anyone pursuing a career in the performing arts.And what a testimony this one is!  If you thought Liza with a ""Z"" was great, you'll love this one.  Liza took EVERTHING to the highest level of performance.  The singing.  The acting.  The dancing.  I was lucky to see this in person and there was a dance at the beginning of the concert (not included in any version) where Liza was the most beautiful, talented and graceful performer I had seen, or will ever see again, on stage.  Her total control of her movements and her technique were flawless.  A dubbed version of Losing my Mind is also missing from this DVD.The only thing missing that I do not miss is the white modest blouse that covered the white outfit in the first act.  It did nothing for Liza.  Thank God it's gone!!!I was going to mention the highlights of the show, but each song is a highlight!!!  So I'll just mention my favorite song: Here I'll Stay/Our Love is Here to Stay.  Minnelli is simply brilliant and totally believable.  I get goose bumps every time I hear this song.The packaging is similar to the Laser Disc, VHS and the CD released at the time.  The visual quality is superb and the sound is perfect.  They even solved a couple of problems from the Laser Disc/VHS versions.  One of them was the synchronization between the image and the sound during the final verses of Seeing Things.  The other one is the transition from Liza's recorded voice into her ""live"" voice at the beginning of Here I'll Stay/Our Love is Here to Stay (The ""We've"" on ""We've got something permanent"").Be advised that there are NO extras in this DVD.  Just Liza.  But somehow, that's more than enough.Buy this DVD TODAY, before it disappears for 30 years like Liza with a ""Z"" did.",5,Millions of Stars for Minnelli the Magnificent,1160006400,"10 5, 2006",2006,1970,"['concert', 'took', 'place', 'shortly', 'Liza', 'health', 'started', 'rapidly', 'decline', 'wanted', 'leave', 'final', 'testimony', 'what', 'could', 'achieve', 'was', 'still', 'top', 'game', 'should', 'be', 'must-see', 'anyone', 'pursuing', 'career', 'performing', 'arts.And', 'what', 'testimony', 'one', 'thought', 'Liza', 'Z', 'was', 'great', ""'ll"", 'love', 'one', 'Liza', 'took', 'EVERTHING', 'highest', 'level', 'performance', 'singing', 'acting', 'dancing', 'was', 'lucky', 'see', 'person', 'was', 'dance', 'beginning', 'concert', 'not', 'included', 'version', 'where', 'Liza', 'was', 'most', 'beautiful', 'talented', 'graceful', 'performer', 'had', 'seen', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'again', 'stage', 'total', 'control', 'movements', 'technique', 'were', 'flawless', 'dubbed', 'version', 'Losing', 'Mind', 'also', 'missing', 'DVD.The', 'only', 'thing', 'missing', 'do', 'not', 'miss', 'white', 'modest', 'blouse', 'covered', 'white', 'outfit', 'first', 'act', 'did', 'nothing', 'Liza', 'Thank', 'God', 'gone', 'was', 'going', 'mention', 'highlights', 'show', 'song', 'highlight', 'So', ""'ll"", 'just', 'mention', 'favorite', 'song', 'Here', ""'ll"", 'Stay/Our', 'Love', 'Here', 'Stay', 'Minnelli', 'simply', 'brilliant', 'totally', 'believable', 'get', 'goose', 'bumps', 'time', 'hear', 'song.The', 'packaging', 'similar', 'Laser', 'Disc', 'VHS', 'CD', 'released', 'time', 'visual', 'quality', 'superb', 'sound', 'perfect', 'even', 'solved', 'couple', 'problems', 'Laser', 'Disc/VHS', 'versions', 'One', 'was', 'synchronization', 'image', 'sound', 'final', 'verses', 'Seeing', 'Things', 'other', 'one', 'transition', 'Liza', 'recorded', 'voice', 'live', 'voice', 'beginning', 'Here', ""'ll"", 'Stay/Our', 'Love', 'Here', 'Stay', ""'ve"", ""'ve"", 'got', 'something', 'permanent', '.Be', 'advised', 'are', 'extras', 'DVD', 'Just', 'Liza', 'somehow', 'more', 'enough.Buy', 'DVD', 'TODAY', '30', 'years', 'Liza', 'Z', 'did']",Liza Minnelli: Live From Radio City Music Hall

And I feel so luky to understand whatmade ""LIZA"" an ICON, but in the last few years consideredmore of a joke. But if you view ""LIZA WITH A Z"" and""AZNAVOUR/MINNELLI"" and now ""Live from Radio City MusicHall,"" which is practically a brand new show will see a top notch performance and production. t I was grateful to see ""Liza"" sing""new standards"" and make a brand new production. ""Liza""shines on all levels. She is at the top of her game andthe songs are excellent, as is ""liza's"" GREAT DANCING.I've never saw a star who is so humble and it is overwhelming.From production down to the choreography, to the songschoosen (and yes you hear ""New York, New York"") is a 90minute of pure greatness! LIZA WE MISS YOU!!!Now I want to see and buy all other concerts that needto be put on DVD from ""Liza."" I know there are at leasttwo out there filmed for cable that needs to be shown.Because these concerts prove that she had the capabilitiesand shined as one of our greatest performers. ""BarbraStreisand"" is great, but she leaves me ""cold"" with herpersonality. ""Liza leaves me in ""tears of happiness"" forthe willingness to sweat and work as hard as possible.BUT PLEASE CABLE TELEVISION, give us the ""FULL CONCERTS""that were filmed some years back. And no editing!!! Whichis what ""FOX STUDIOS"" DID with a VHS CONCERT. IF YOUPUT ThE DVDS OUT with some publicity we will buy them!A great concert and DVD. WORTH OWNING! And yes, Streisandmove over and share in the glory of being an ""ICON!""My biggest regret is that she hasn't done many films.I hope she does at least just one more to show howdynamic she is.*Though the review shows a 3 STAR Rating I don't understandwhy for I gave this concert a 5 STAR Rating.",3,STREISAND MOVE OVER...LIZA'S HERE!

1011281,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B000H7JCIW,Stephanie De Pue,"[4, 4]","""Liza Live from Radio City Music Hall"" is an excellent live concert recording DVD that seems to suffer in undeserved obscurity alongside its beloved stable mate, ""Liza with a Z."" It gives us a young Liza, star of stage, screen and television, at the top of her form. It was made by many talented hands, and won a Primetime Emmy, so its obscurity is surely not deserved.For starters, it was written for the stage and directed by Fred Ebb, of the greatly talented pair of songwriters from whom Minelli has gotten some of her most famous material ---try ""Cabaret,"" or even ""Chicago."" It was choreographed by Susan Stroman, who has gone from triumph to triumph on Broadway recently - try ""The Producers."" (And Stroman actually directed the recent movie version of that hit play.)  ""Live"" was produced by multi-talented Phil Ramone, directed by reliable tv hand Louis J. Horvitz.  Jazzman Billy Stritch gets credit for musical supervision.  Clothing was by esteemed designer Isaac Mizrahi; Liza's makeup was by deservedly popular Kevyn Aucoin.  And then, of course, we get Minelli herself, backed by a good-sized orchestra that occasionally sings too, and her ""Demon Divas,"" a group of women that's unusually inclusive by age and size, who sing and dance like, well, demons.Then there's the star of course, one of the belters in the great tradition of her mother, beloved star of stage and screen, Judy Garland.  Each can pack a song full of emotion while belting it out, but can still deliver a quiet one; can act out a song as few others, and can change pace on the spot.  In addition, as a younger woman, Minelli's generally got more energy than her mother. The young star had not yet begun to have voice or hip troubles; she can work up a sweat dancing, and still deliver the goods vocally.For the first act, Minelli joins us in Mizrahi's famous white trenchcoat. That act is on the quieter side, with memorable solo versions of ""Teach Me Tonight,"" ""Old Friends,"" and a cynical number Lotte Lenya introduced in 1929 Berlin, cabaret time, ""So What."" It concludes with a work by the French singer-songwriter Charles Aznavour, in that language, for a lovely emotional-laden tribute to Minelli's father.  He, Vincente Minelli, went from art director at Radio City, as a young man during the 1930's, to a famous director of movie musicals.The singer speeds up the second act.  She's joined on stage by the Demon Divas; don't ask me why, but the way they were salted away in the audience, and stood up to demand to join her onstage just made me uneasy.  But they sure do a job of work.  During several medleys, the star and her divas give us fresh versions of favorite ""Cabaret"" tunes, a new take on her mother's ""The Man I Love,"" a sexy, high-energy, white-gloved tribute to her close associate Bob Fosse, and a high-stepping, ever-so-appropriate to the venue, Rockette style tap dance.  And soaked in sweat, lubricious in a bright red dress, she gives us an electrifying version of her signature, ""New York, New York,"" backed by those divas, in black Mizrahi trenchcoats this time.  The number of people who love Liza is no puzzle.  What is? The relative obscurity of this selection.",4,Energy and Emotion,1200355200,"01 15, 2008",2008,3178,"['Liza', 'Live', 'Radio', 'City', 'Music', 'Hall', 'excellent', 'live', 'concert', 'recording', 'DVD', 'suffer', 'undeserved', 'obscurity', 'beloved', 'stable', 'mate', 'Liza', 'Z', 'young', 'Liza', 'star', 'stage', 'screen', 'television', 'top', 'form', 'was', 'made', 'many', 'talented', 'hands', 'won', 'Primetime', 'Emmy', 'obscurity', 'surely', 'not', 'deserved.For', 'starters', 'was', 'written', 'stage', 'directed', 'Fred', 'Ebb', 'greatly', 'talented', 'pair', 'songwriters', 'whom', 'Minelli', 'gotten', 'most', 'famous', 'material', '-try', 'Cabaret', 'even', 'Chicago', 'was', 'choreographed', 'Susan', 'Stroman', 'who', 'gone', 'triumph', 'triumph', 'Broadway', 'recently', 'try', 'Producers', 'Stroman', 'actually', 'directed', 'recent', 'movie', 'version', 'hit', 'play', 'Live', 'was', 'produced', 'multi-talented', 'Phil', 'Ramone', 'directed', 'reliable', 'tv', 'hand', 'Louis', 'J.', 'Horvitz', 'Jazzman', 'Billy', 'Stritch', 'credit', 'musical', 'supervision', 'Clothing', 'was', 'esteemed', 'designer', 'Isaac', 'Mizrahi', 'Liza', 'makeup', 'was', 'deservedly', 'popular', 'Kevyn', 'Aucoin', 'then', 'course', 'get', 'Minelli', 'backed', 'good-sized', 'orchestra', 'occasionally', 'too', 'Demon', 'Divas', 'group', 'women', 'unusually', 'inclusive', 'age', 'size', 'who', 'sing', 'dance', 'well', 'demons.Then', 'star', 'course', 'one', 'belters', 'great', 'tradition', 'mother', 'beloved', 'star', 'stage', 'screen', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'can', 'pack', 'song', 'full', 'emotion', 'belting', 'out', 'can', 'still', 'deliver', 'quiet', 'one', 'can', 'act', 'out', 'song', 'few', 'others', 'can', 'change', 'pace', 'spot', 'addition', 'younger', 'woman', 'Minelli', 'generally', 'got', 'more', 'energy', 'mother', 'young', 'star', 'had', 'not', 'yet', 'begun', 'have', 'voice', 'hip', 'troubles', 'can', 'work', 'up', 'sweat', 'dancing', 'still', 'deliver', 'goods', 'vocally.For', 'first', 'act', 'Minelli', 'Mizrahi', 'famous', 'white', 'trenchcoat', 'act', 'quieter', 'side', 'memorable', 'solo', 'versions', 'Teach', 'Me', 'Tonight', 'Old', 'Friends', 'cynical', 'number', 'Lotte', 'Lenya', 'introduced', '1929', 'Berlin', 'cabaret', 'time', 'So', 'What', 'work', 'French', 'singer-songwriter', 'Charles', 'Aznavour', 'language', 'lovely', 'emotional-laden', 'tribute', 'Minelli', 'father', 'Vincente', 'Minelli', 'went', 'art', 'director', 'Radio', 'City', 'young', 'man', '1930', 'famous', 'director', 'movie', 'musicals.The', 'singer', 'up', 'second', 'act', 'joined', 'stage', 'Demon', 'Divas', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'why', 'way', 'were', 'salted', 'away', 'audience', 'stood', 'up', 'demand', 'join', 'onstage', 'just', 'made', 'uneasy', 'sure', 'do', 'job', 'work', 'several', 'medleys', 'star', 'divas', 'give', 'fresh', 'versions', 'favorite', 'Cabaret', 'tunes', 'new', 'take', 'mother', 'Man', 'Love', 'sexy', 'high-energy', 'white-gloved', 'tribute', 'close', 'associate', 'Bob', 'Fosse', 'high-stepping', 'ever-so-appropriate', 'venue', 'Rockette', 'style', 'tap', 'dance', 'soaked', 'sweat', 'lubricious', 'bright', 'red', 'dress', 'electrifying', 'version', 'signature', 'New', 'York', 'New', 'York', 'backed', 'divas', 'black', 'Mizrahi', 'time', 'number', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'Liza', 'puzzle', 'What', 'relative', 'obscurity', 'selection']",Liza Minnelli: Live From Radio City Music Hall
