Season 2 was based on a &#34;bachelor&#34; show type situation that never really seemed to get moving. First one of the contestants figures out the show is a setup right away, and they end up having to get a replacement and let the original contestant join the 'cast' side of things. The drama is often not entertaining, and the episodes are long for the entertainment value. Season 3 just came out and is by far the BEST of the series, but its more expensive by far to own.

It has no extras, save for scenes that were originally cut out.  (The scene with the first Joe Schmo, Matt Gould, was cut out of the TV airings.)  It should be noted that the language is not censored; the ""f-bomb"" is quite frequently, so you may not want to watch it with people that might be offended by that kind of language.  It should be noted that this season did not show as much female skin as the first.I liked the male lead in this season, Tim, more than I did Matt of Season 1, who was a nice guy but needed to ""man up"" sometimes.I must refute a claim made on the cover, which said the final episode never aired.  I remember quite clearly that it did err, although some parts might have been added to it.

This program gets more outrageous, more original and more fun the first one even did and that one was pretty great. Watch for characters such as Bryce, the crazed stalker and Gerald, the gotta-be-gay guy. All are performing for Joe and Jane Schmo (Tim Walsh and Ingrid Wiese), the only two who think that it's all real.

The stuff that the writers put into this show is nothing short of hilarious.  Some of the best characters on this season were Cammy the moron, Bryce the stalker, and Eleanor the weeper (whom I thought deserved an Emmy award).  We also get to see the return of the host from the first season, but with a phony British accent.  Though the concept of this season is slightly different than the first season (having 2 Schmo's, and a different game), it is even better to watch 2 people wade through the over dramatic writing that has been put in place.  I do not want to ruin this season for anyone who has not seen it, but for the price, it is well worth the laughs that it gives.

After viewing it I was pleasantly surprised. This season ended up being very entertaining. The cast, while bigger and more like a bunch of people instead of big characters, helped carry the show in many aread. These schmo's seemed to click with the cast better and real friendships seemed to be forming, both in and out of character. Twists of the season were interesting and shook things up, making the show feel more like an improvization rather then following a script. I was surprised at how much story, personality and humor were in each episode and I feel I got more out of this season. Also the humor was better as this season really was about each actors personality rather then just outlasting everyone.However there are some gripes I've got with this. Personally I think Austin isn't the prime example to be offered as a suitor, even though only one person needs to believe that. SPOILER ALERT FOR THE OTHERS, The bringing back of three different people was annoying for me, because of the reasons. First person is fine. Second person, didn't make any sense. Austin asked for someone back so Piper gets one back also. The third person is ok but, it had been done so many times I wished they had done that part differently. Finally when the women Schmo's are awarded their prizes, I feel they shouldn't have gotten the complete 100 grand. They should've gotten about 75 each, (Amanda because she wasn't there the whole time, and Ingrid because she was an actor for bitts of it, still helpful and great for the show but not worthy of all 100).Still I enjoyed this and I can't compare the seasons as there is reasons to like and not like each of them. I'm hopeing season 3 continues the trend and that Ralph isn't in as ridiculous of a disquise.",5,Better then I thought it would be,1356998400,"01 1, 2013",2013,1855,"['did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'season', '2', 'show', 'be', 'great', 'espically', 'bearly', 'anyone', 'talked', 'viewing', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'season', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'very', 'entertaining', 'cast', 'bigger', 'more', 'bunch', 'people', 'instead', 'big', 'characters', 'helped', 'carry', 'show', 'many', 'aread', 'schmo', 'seemed', 'click', 'cast', 'better', 'real', 'friendships', 'seemed', 'be', 'forming', 'character', 'Twists', 'season', 'were', 'interesting', 'shook', 'things', 'up', 'making', 'show', 'feel', 'more', 'improvization', 'rather', 'then', 'following', 'script', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'story', 'personality', 'humor', 'were', 'episode', 'feel', 'got', 'more', 'season', 'Also', 'humor', 'was', 'better', 'season', 'really', 'was', 'actors', 'personality', 'rather', 'then', 'just', 'outlasting', 'everyone.However', 'are', 'gripes', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Personally', 'think', 'Austin', ""n't"", 'prime', 'example', 'be', 'offered', 'suitor', 'even', 'only', 'one', 'person', 'believe', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'FOR', 'THE', 'OTHERS', 'bringing', 'back', 'three', 'different', 'people', 'was', 'annoying', 'reasons', 'First', 'person', 'fine', 'Second', 'person', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'Austin', 'asked', 'someone', 'back', 'so', 'Piper', 'one', 'back', 'also', 'third', 'person', 'ok', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'wished', 'had', 'done', 'part', 'differently', 'Finally', 'when', 'women', 'Schmo', 'are', 'awarded', 'prizes', 'feel', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'gotten', 'complete', '100', 'grand', 'should', ""'ve"", 'gotten', '75', 'Amanda', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'whole', 'time', 'Ingrid', 'was', 'actor', 'bitts', 'still', 'helpful', 'great', 'show', 'not', 'worthy', '100', '.Still', 'enjoyed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'seasons', 'reasons', 'like', 'not', ""'m"", 'hopeing', 'season', '3', 'trend', 'Ralph', ""n't"", 'as', 'ridiculous', 'disquise']",Joe Schmo 2

There are 2 people that ""think"" that they are in a real reality tv show for love. Everyone else is an actor. The producers try to see just how much they can get away with without pushing it over the limit of unbelievability. Will the 2 people (Schmo's) being fooled, figure it out before the end or will they go along with the crazy love show?If anyone has seen Joe Schmo, this is exactly the same, but this time, with 2 people that think it's all real.",5,LOVE IT!,1358035200,"01 13, 2013",2013,565,"['Such', 'funny', 'show', 'was', 'so', 'glad', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'Basically', 'reality', 'tv', 'series', 'twist', 'are', '2', 'people', 'think', 'are', 'real', 'reality', 'tv', 'show', 'love', 'Everyone', 'else', 'actor', 'producers', 'try', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'pushing', 'limit', 'unbelievability', 'Will', '2', 'people', 'Schmo', 'being', 'fooled', 'figure', 'out', 'end', 'will', 'go', 'crazy', 'love', 'show', 'anyone', 'seen', 'Joe', 'Schmo', 'exactly', 'same', 'time', '2', 'people', 'think', 'real']",Joe Schmo 2
