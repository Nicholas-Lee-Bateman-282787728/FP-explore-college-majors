I think if the screenplay would have been better would have helped.I have seen worse such as Fighting Tommy Riley, which I thought was pure crap. The Boxer is worth a rental, but hardly a keeper for the dvd library. It really could have been so much more. Give it a shot, but don't expect any great thrills or twists.",3,Worth A Rental,1242777600,"05 20, 2009",2009,454,"['Rocky', 'not', 'storyline', 'was', 'pretty', 'predictable', 'valiant', 'effort', 'what', 'am', 'sure', 'was', 'very', 'limited', 'budget', 'think', 'screenplay', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'would', 'have', 'helped.I', 'have', 'seen', 'worse', 'such', 'Fighting', 'Tommy', 'Riley', 'thought', 'was', 'pure', 'crap', 'Boxer', 'rental', 'hardly', 'keeper', 'dvd', 'library', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'Give', 'shot', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'great', 'thrills', 'twists']",The Boxer

1233897,A1AQ9R3L8ZWWEC,B001RTKKR6,"LMG ""ancient art prof""","[0, 0]","As in the case of another reviewer, I was interested in this movie because I was impressed by Josh Dallas's recent peformances in ""Once Upon A Time"". I was not disappointed. The boxing in this movie really serves more as a back drop to much larger issues. The main character (JD) is trying to reconnect with family and life in general after serving a prison term for beating up an abusive stepfather (he beat JD's mother); Stacy Keach (a former boxing champ in his own right) takes a shine to JD, employs him in his gym first as a handyman-cleaner and then as his new boxing protege.  The interacton of the two men, the personal problems that they have and are able to overcome are the real linchpins of this film. The boxing is well choreographed without the hyperbolic slugging and training of ""Rocky"" and has a more realistic tinge. A journey of two men who come to terms with  their past, present, future, and each other gives heart to a film that has much more substance than one might expect from the title alone. The presence of a jealous and nasty rival boxer who is hell bent on making life miserable for JD adds just the right balance of ""evil"" to keep the film from being too saccharine while stimulating and motivating the two main characters. In the end, the movie succeeds thanks to the acting and storyline in general because it avoids being a cliche even though it trods familar territory.",4,It's More of a Human Nature Story,1330214400,"02 26, 2012",2012,1405,"['case', 'reviewer', 'was', 'interested', 'movie', 'was', 'impressed', 'Josh', 'Dallas', 'recent', 'peformances', 'Once', 'A', 'Time', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'boxing', 'movie', 'really', 'more', 'back', 'drop', 'much', 'larger', 'issues', 'main', 'character', 'JD', 'trying', 'reconnect', 'family', 'life', 'general', 'serving', 'prison', 'term', 'beating', 'up', 'abusive', 'stepfather', 'JD', 'mother', 'Stacy', 'Keach', 'former', 'boxing', 'champ', 'own', 'right', 'shine', 'JD', 'gym', 'first', 'handyman-cleaner', 'then', 'new', 'boxing', 'protege', 'interacton', 'two', 'men', 'personal', 'problems', 'have', 'are', 'able', 'overcome', 'are', 'real', 'linchpins', 'film', 'boxing', 'well', 'choreographed', 'hyperbolic', 'slugging', 'training', 'Rocky', 'more', 'realistic', 'tinge', 'journey', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'come', 'terms', 'past', 'present', 'future', 'other', 'heart', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'substance', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'title', 'alone', 'presence', 'jealous', 'nasty', 'rival', 'boxer', 'who', 'hell', 'bent', 'making', 'life', 'miserable', 'JD', 'just', 'right', 'balance', 'evil', 'keep', 'film', 'being', 'too', 'saccharine', 'stimulating', 'motivating', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'end', 'movie', 'thanks', 'acting', 'storyline', 'general', 'being', 'cliche', 'even', 'familar', 'territory']",The Boxer

I won't ruin the film by telling you in detail what happens. I will tell you that if you love boxing movies this is a pretty decent film. It is low budget and that makes a lot of people tune out. I don't understand why since it still is a good little movie. You don't get awsome effects during the fight scenes, but you do get a good story and that is what this movie is. A good story that doesn't have endless sex and violence. It is a film you can watch with your family and just enjoy. I know my wife enjoyed this film. I have trouble sometimes finding movies that me and my wife can get into. I love horror movies but my wife doesn't. It was a nice change to just enjoy a movie together. So if your looking for a movie to enjoy with your family look no further. If you want sex, violence, and profanity, well then look elsewhere. This is a movie with a good story to tell.",3,Rocky it's not,1297641600,"02 14, 2011",2011,974,"['just', 'finished', 'watching', 'boxer', 'wife', 'was', 'surprised', 'fact', 'liked', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'film', 'telling', 'detail', 'what', 'will', 'tell', 'love', 'boxing', 'movies', 'pretty', 'decent', 'film', 'low', 'budget', 'lot', 'people', 'tune', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'still', 'good', 'little', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'awsome', 'effects', 'fight', 'scenes', 'do', 'get', 'good', 'story', 'what', 'movie', 'good', 'story', ""n't"", 'have', 'endless', 'sex', 'violence', 'film', 'can', 'watch', 'family', 'just', 'enjoy', 'know', 'wife', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'have', 'trouble', 'sometimes', 'finding', 'movies', 'wife', 'can', 'get', 'love', 'horror', 'movies', 'wife', ""n't"", 'was', 'nice', 'change', 'just', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'together', 'So', 'looking', 'movie', 'enjoy', 'family', 'look', 'further', 'want', 'sex', 'violence', 'profanity', 'well', 'then', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'movie', 'good', 'story', 'tell']",The Boxer

So I don't want to type all this again so take it from me, every scene came out of some other boxing movie (but  as one writer stated definitely not Rocky). I bought it because ""Joe"" (Stacy Keach ) a retired boxer (with a secret) and now gym owner became reluctant Ben's trainer (poor Ben was a reluctant ex-convict who went to jail saving his mother- his secret). Keach was a great actor (in his day).
