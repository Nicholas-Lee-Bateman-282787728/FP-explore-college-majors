547650,A1GWLM8VRAYWGO,B00004R65K,Love Firefly,"[0, 1]","The only thing missing from the DVD version is the last part of the Movie where StringFellow Hawk Plays the Chello for the Eagle as he remembers Gabrelle while out on the dock and it is rather moving.  Other than that it is an excellent recording.  And the interview with Ernest Borgnine is fun.  He was a great actor and will be sorely missed.  (I wrote this review 3 days prior to receiving the series)As for the 12 or so minutes missing from the movie itself I found a cure for that.  The First Season DVD set has the Pilot for the series and everything that was missing from the Movie here is on that first disc.  So I got my music back at the end of the program I have always immensely enjoyed even at the age of about 12.  But now many years later I know I have a much greater appreciation for not only the music but the Series itself, the paintings, the scenery, the actors and actress's and all the work that went into making the series as enjoyable then as it is now.The reproduction is very well done.  It plays well on both my Blue Ray player and my DVD player.  I could not be happier.  Everyone did a fantastic job on this and everyone should be congradulated and commended for all their hard work and efforts to bring back something so many of us enjoyed for a very long time.  I can at least say Thank you so very much for releasing it so we can enjoy for a long time to come and at any time.
