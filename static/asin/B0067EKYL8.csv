I was born in the late eighties and caught the tail end of Bette Midler and Billy Crystal's established years in the spot light, so I was familiar with their careers and schtick growing up as a kid. The jokes were subtle but funny, and there were times I literally laughed out loud and that says something because I watched this on an iPad with headphones, and usually I'm dead silent. It's a kid movie so you have your pratfalls and kicked in the nuts jokes but it wasn't dumbed down and the the actors delivering their lines are obviously going to make the best out of that material. I didn't watch this movie to roll on the floor laughing, but hey, I feel it was worth the rental. It was sweet, had a good message, and ended on a high note with singing by Bette and Billy that is a good throwback.

This movie had no sex, no violence and I don't remember a single curse word (not that this is an issue for me... just a nice, unexpected change of pace).  A great family film, appropriate for any age.The basic premise of Mom and Dad needing a break from the kids, and having to call the out of favor grand parents, kind of reminded me ofUncle Buckas Billy and Bette are a barely known commodity to the kids and definitely not the first choice of their parents to watch them.The movie focuses on struggles and resolutions. For parents, grandparents and kids. Not always perfect, but real, and well payed by Billy and Bette with a great supporting cast.Another common theme throughout the movie (and one of the best springboards for Billy Crystal's humor...) was the generation gap.  Struggles with a high-tech world that is normal for the kids, but like a foreign land to grandparents.This movie isn't about a strong story line, it's about laughing your way through the absurdity that is sometimes our lives.  The ups and downs of parenting, the wisdom of grandparents, children struggling to grow and the love that binds families amid it all.If you're looking for a family film with strong comedic laughs, sweet moments with some tears, and a triumphant ending.

Reasoning with public misbehaviors doesn't even lift an eyebrow for fear of damaging a child's freedom of expression. Place this depressing bit of generation gap on the screen and the result is this flimsy, trite, overacted, and wearisome PARENTAL GUIDANCE. The true test of patience is being able to resist turning it off.Sixty-something grandparents Artie (Billy Crystal) and Diane (Bette Midler), pushed into the background because of their old-fashioned  structured ways of dealing with their grandchildren Harper (Bailee Madison), Turner (Joshua Rush), and Barker (Kyle Harrison Breitkopf) as raised in the permissive non-confrontational new parenting modes of daughter Alice (Marisa Tomei) and husband Phil (Tom Everett Scott). Asked to `baby sit' for a week, the two forms of parenting clash and the result is a display of some of the most trite overindulged childish behavior ever screened. There are occasional moments of giggles - such as when Artie bribes the kids with money to do his will - but for the most part this is just a loud silly movie for the masses. There are some good actors here but by and large their acting is sub-par and who can blame them. This is a film that falls into the `must miss' category even if you love Marisa Tomei, Bette Midler, and Billy Crystal.

Unfortunately, these three great talents are lost in a very cliche and predictable script. This story has been done over and over and there is nothing new to make PARENTAL GUIDANCE anything more than a cute little movie without much purpose.Alice and Phil Simmons have a chance to attend a conference and finally have some alone time away from their three kids. Alice's parents Artie and Diane (Crystal and Midler), are hesitantly asked to fly into town to stay with the three young Simmons kids. It's not clear why Alice has distanced herself from her parents and why babysitting duty seems like a bad idea. Who would love feisty Bette Midler as a grandparent?The Simmons household is a modern one. They live in a voice-activated home that caters to their every wishes. Inter personal communication is a thing of the past. It's sort of cute for all of 5 minutes and then it just becomes annoying. Phil and Alice are modern parents who live in a world where baseball games are always a draw. There can be no winners and no losers. A kid at bat stays at bat until he makes a hit. No one ever strikes out.Artie and Diane are old school parents who rebel against this modern parenting.The predictability is strong that we know what is going to happen when Artie and Diane are told the kids cannot have sugar and cannot watch scary movies. Anyone knows what will happen next along with Artie telling the middle son how to handle a bully. There just is no middle point here. Anyone could guess how this movie will play out so in the end the question is, ""what is the point?""Midler does light up the screen and it seems like she is working hard to shine in a bland script. Cystral just seems tired throughout the film. Even Tomei seems like she would rather be somewhere else. PARENTAL GUIDANCE is pleasant but just so disappointingly predictable. It's not a bad film.

1512158,A356HRZZFCEGL1,B0067EKYL8,"John Panagopoulos ""John Andrew Panagopoulos""","[27, 33]","***This review may contain spoilers***The trailers advertising ""Parental Guidance"" (hereafter PG) were not only unpromising, but borderline appalling.  It emphasized the tired, painful slapstick and saccharine sentiment of so many other formulaic family comedies, that I was determined to avoid it.  But, visiting my mother and deciding to take in a movie before lunch at Bugaboo Creek Steakhouse, we decided upon PG because it was the only movie that had subject matter my Mom (not particularly keen on hobbits, 40-somethings, or even Lincoln) was interested in.  After seeing it, we were pleasantly (if surprisingly) entertained, despite the dilapidated old ""Clash of the Generations"" plot.  Our amusement was largely due to those reliably schticky comedy workhorses Billy Crystal and Bette Midler.Crystal and Midler play fairly (but not completely) old-fashioned Artie and Diane Decker, parents to Type-A, harried upper-class daughter Alice Decker Simmons (Marisa Tomei).  Alice is married to Phil Simmons (Tom Everett Scott) a basically easygoing engineer who, like Rick Moranis's Wayne Szalinski in the ""Honey, I.."" movies has converted their home into a technological, computerized, self-sustaining ""house of tomorrow"". Their children are Harper (Bailee Madison), who is as neurotically driven as her mother, Turner (Joshua Rush) her more levelheaded, technologically savvy brother who has a stuttering problem, and certainly not least, the mischievous, irreverent, red-haired Barker (Kyle Harrison Breitkopf) whose best friend is an invisible kangaroo named Carl (not Harvey).Unlike the paternal grandparents, Artie and Diane have not seen their grandchildren in months, if not years.  They are ""the other grandparents"".  But they get a chance to bond with the tykes when Alice and Phil leave for a week for a scientific convention and, somewhat reluctantly, call on the ""out-of-it"" folks to baby-sit. As they say, hilarity (amazingly) ensues.Artie and Diane, although sharp and game, have their work cut out for them.  Besides the aformentioned baggage (and yuppified names!) each grandchild carries, and the mechanized Jetson-like home, Artie and Diane have to contend with the permissive parenting their charges are used to and their high-maintenance demands (e.g., each kid gets his own meal at suppertime, and Barker doesn't like his food touching other food).  Furthermore, Artie is despondent over his firing from his minor league baseball announcer job, and he fears telling Alice.  All sorts of slapstick hijicks, misadventures, and misunderstandings ensue.  Examples, Artie has to bribe the bratty Barker to do anything, Artie's advice to Turner to stand up to the bullies making fun of his speech impediment gets the kid a shiner - from the bully's sister, the kids get an amped-up ""sugar high"" from some forbidden birthday cake, Artie protests at a little league baseball game that has no strikes, timeouts, or scoring and gets a bat in the crotch for his troubles, Barker gets indelible day-glo paint on Artie's face just before Harper's violin recital, and of course Artie sneaks off with Barker to an X-Games announcer's interview where Barker's escape and urination ruins an X-games skateboard stunt (and is broadcast nationally) as well as Artie's job prospects. Diane has a confrontation with Harper's demanding, martinet East European violin instructor, calling her ""comrade"".  The comedy of errors keeps on coming.In the hands of inexperienced actors, PG would be a groan-fest.  But in Crystal's and Midler's capable, vaudevillian, borscht-belt hands, they are surprisingly funny.  Crystal's cynical comments and one-liners wryly commenting on the insanity of their grandkids' lives, even more than the predictable slapstick, keep the laughs coming, because we agree with their disapproval of the grandkids' overwrought, permissive, but also perfectionist lifestyle.  Even so, they love their grandkids and incrementally not only get to know them better, but also to overcome their handicaps and neuroses.  At first shocked at Artie's and Diane's interference, Alice gradually gets reconciled to their ways of doing things, and to them as general.  In unrealistic but satisfying sitcom fashion, everyone's issues get resolved and everybody's happy.Yes, PG is unsophisticated and predictable and even a bit low-brow.  But Crystal's and Midler's tried-and-true comic personae wring out the laughs and make you feel reasonably good.",3,Crystal and Midler Get on their Schtick and Liven Up This Formulaic Family Comedy,1357171200,"01 3, 2013",2013,4456,"['***This', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers***The', 'trailers', 'advertising', 'Parental', 'Guidance', 'hereafter', 'PG', 'were', 'not', 'only', 'unpromising', 'borderline', 'appalling', 'emphasized', 'tired', 'painful', 'slapstick', 'saccharine', 'sentiment', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'formulaic', 'family', 'comedies', 'was', 'determined', 'avoid', 'visiting', 'mother', 'deciding', 'take', 'movie', 'lunch', 'Bugaboo', 'Creek', 'Steakhouse', 'decided', 'upon', 'PG', 'was', 'only', 'movie', 'had', 'subject', 'matter', 'Mom', 'not', 'particularly', 'keen', 'hobbits', '40-somethings', 'even', 'Lincoln', 'was', 'interested', 'seeing', 'were', 'pleasantly', 'surprisingly', 'entertained', 'dilapidated', 'old', 'Clash', 'Generations', 'plot', 'amusement', 'was', 'largely', 'due', 'reliably', 'schticky', 'comedy', 'workhorses', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'Bette', 'Midler.Crystal', 'Midler', 'play', 'fairly', 'not', 'completely', 'old-fashioned', 'Artie', 'Diane', 'Decker', 'parents', 'Type-A', 'harried', 'upper-class', 'daughter', 'Alice', 'Decker', 'Simmons', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'Alice', 'married', 'Phil', 'Simmons', 'Tom', 'Everett', 'Scott', 'basically', 'easygoing', 'engineer', 'who', 'Rick', 'Moranis', 'Wayne', 'Szalinski', 'Honey', 'I..', 'movies', 'converted', 'home', 'technological', 'computerized', 'self-sustaining', 'house', 'tomorrow', 'children', 'are', 'Harper', 'Bailee', 'Madison', 'who', 'neurotically', 'driven', 'mother', 'Turner', 'Joshua', 'Rush', 'more', 'levelheaded', 'technologically', 'savvy', 'brother', 'who', 'stuttering', 'problem', 'certainly', 'not', 'least', 'mischievous', 'irreverent', 'red-haired', 'Barker', 'Kyle', 'Harrison', 'Breitkopf', 'best', 'friend', 'invisible', 'kangaroo', 'named', 'Carl', 'not', 'Harvey', 'paternal', 'grandparents', 'Artie', 'Diane', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'grandchildren', 'months', 'not', 'years', 'are', 'other', 'grandparents', 'get', 'chance', 'bond', 'tykes', 'when', 'Alice', 'Phil', 'leave', 'week', 'scientific', 'convention', 'somewhat', 'reluctantly', 'call', 'out-of-it', 'folks', 'baby-sit', 'say', 'hilarity', 'amazingly', 'ensues.Artie', 'Diane', 'sharp', 'game', 'have', 'work', 'cut', 'out', 'aformentioned', 'baggage', 'yuppified', 'names', 'grandchild', 'mechanized', 'Jetson-like', 'home', 'Artie', 'Diane', 'have', 'contend', 'permissive', 'parenting', 'charges', 'are', 'used', 'high-maintenance', 'demands', 'e.g.', 'kid', 'own', 'meal', 'suppertime', 'Barker', ""n't"", 'like', 'food', 'touching', 'other', 'food', 'Furthermore', 'Artie', 'despondent', 'firing', 'minor', 'league', 'baseball', 'announcer', 'job', 'telling', 'Alice', 'sorts', 'slapstick', 'hijicks', 'misadventures', 'misunderstandings', 'ensue', 'Examples', 'Artie', 'bribe', 'bratty', 'Barker', 'do', 'anything', 'Artie', 'advice', 'Turner', 'stand', 'up', 'bullies', 'making', 'fun', 'speech', 'impediment', 'kid', 'shiner', 'bully', 'sister', 'kids', 'get', 'amped-up', 'sugar', 'high', 'forbidden', 'birthday', 'cake', 'Artie', 'little', 'league', 'baseball', 'game', 'strikes', 'timeouts', 'scoring', 'bat', 'crotch', 'troubles', 'Barker', 'indelible', 'day-glo', 'paint', 'Artie', 'face', 'just', 'Harper', 'violin', 'recital', 'course', 'Artie', 'Barker', 'X-Games', 'announcer', 'interview', 'where', 'Barker', 'escape', 'urination', 'ruins', 'X-games', 'skateboard', 'stunt', 'broadcast', 'nationally', 'as', 'well', 'Artie', 'job', 'prospects', 'Diane', 'confrontation', 'Harper', 'demanding', 'martinet', 'East', 'European', 'violin', 'instructor', 'calling', 'comrade', 'comedy', 'errors', 'keeps', 'coming.In', 'hands', 'inexperienced', 'actors', 'PG', 'would', 'be', 'groan-fest', 'Crystal', 'Midler', 'capable', 'vaudevillian', 'borscht-belt', 'hands', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'funny', 'Crystal', 'cynical', 'comments', 'one-liners', 'wryly', 'commenting', 'insanity', 'grandkids', 'lives', 'even', 'more', 'predictable', 'slapstick', 'keep', 'laughs', 'coming', 'agree', 'disapproval', 'grandkids', 'overwrought', 'permissive', 'also', 'perfectionist', 'lifestyle', 'Even', 'so', 'love', 'grandkids', 'incrementally', 'not', 'only', 'get', 'know', 'better', 'also', 'overcome', 'handicaps', 'neuroses', 'first', 'shocked', 'Artie', 'Diane', 'interference', 'Alice', 'gradually', 'reconciled', 'ways', 'doing', 'things', 'general', 'unrealistic', 'satisfying', 'sitcom', 'fashion', 'everyone', 'issues', 'get', 'resolved', 'everybody', 'happy.Yes', 'PG', 'unsophisticated', 'predictable', 'even', 'bit', 'low-brow', 'Crystal', 'Midler', 'tried-and-true', 'comic', 'personae', 'wring', 'out', 'laughs', 'make', 'feel', 'reasonably', 'good']",Parental Guidance

It really had the potential to make a comment on the generation gap and the 180 degree turn from how people were raised 35 years ago compared to present but the script was simply lousy.  In its attempts to be funny, it fell far short, I didn't even crack a smile, let alone laugh.The acting seemed very contrived.  It definitely demonstrates the concept of overacting both Crystal and Midler (or perhaps the director) apparently believe that if they talked louder it would be funnier, unfortunately, it distracted and detracted from the movie, further being more an annoyance than humorous.The premise is that Grandparents are needed to babysit one week for 3 grandchildren two of whom are unruly tyrants.  They are instructed that no discipline other than reasoning with the grandchild is allowed.  The children are pampered by coaches, teachers, with the exception of a Russian Musician, who takes her responsibility so seriously, she offers destructive criticism as motivation.  The Grandparents initially want to gain points with their daughter and grandchildren by going along with protocol, but finally loose control in the face of all this pandering to children and its absurdity.It was a great idea but poorly written and the acting just wasn't realistic.  Billy Crystal looks ancient in this movie making it hard to believe that he is the grandfather and not the great-grandfather, and he is so full of botox, his features are somewhat distorted.This movie just didn't do anything for me.  I saw it the first time two or three months ago, and I didn't realize until about 40 minutes into it that I had already seen it.  I tried to watch it all the way through but after 60+ minutes, I quit, I was just to bored to see it to the end a second time.This definitely wasn't a good forum for some excellent actors.

1512168,A37MH7ICH80QOX,B0067EKYL8,Kate McMurry,"[2, 2]","Billy Crystal and Bette Midler play Artie and Diane Decker, a couple in their late 50's who have been married for 35 years and became parents to their only offspring, 38-year-old Alice (Marisa Tomei), when they were in their early 20's. Artie has made a career as a sports announcer for a minor-league baseball team, and Diane spent years as a ""weather girl."" They traveled around a lot during Alice's childhood and viewed themselves as fun, laid-back parents. They assumed at the time that Alice was having a fun time, too, but that perception was proven false when Alice went away to college and rarely had anything to do with them after that.Alice has been married since her mid-20's to a brilliant engineer named Phil (Tom Everett Scott) who's about her age. Phil has recently moved his family into a prototype, computerized home he designed. It is so huge that, the first time Artie sees it, he refers to it as a ""McStadium"" (a play on the derisive term, ""McMansion,"" for a gigantic, tastelessly generic suburban home). Though Alice and Phil are in a loving marriage and are kind, attentive, non-demanding parents, it becomes apparent soon after we are introduced to them that they may have ""coddled"" their children far too much, because each has a distinctive, emotional problem.Their oldest, 12-year-old Harper (Bailee Madison), is a highly talented violinist who's mapped out her whole life with the ultimate, adult goal in mind of playing in a world-renowned orchestra in Europe. Unfortunately, her driven behavior to reach this enormous goal is stealing all the joy from her childhood.The middle child, 8-year-old Turner (Joshua Rush) is smart and quite mature for his age, but he stutters, which has led to him being socially awkward and bullied at school.The youngest, 5-year-old Barker (Kyle Harrison Breitkopf), wears weird outfits and constantly follows the mischievous commands of his invisible best friend, a kangaroo named Carl.Unlike Phil's parents, Artie and Diane have not seen their grandchildren very often because of the way Alice has withdrawn from them over the years. When Alice and Phil have a chance to take their first vacation in years to spend a week in a tropical paradise for a conference where Phil is slated to win a prestigious award, they need someone to watch their kids. Phil's parents are unavailable, and Phil urges Alice to allow her parents to take care of the kids. Alice squirms at the thought of entrusting her precious children, each with a demanding protocol for his/her care, to her flaky parents, but to please Phil she calls them. Artie wants to refuse Alice's request because he's depressed about being dumped from his job, but Diane ignores his protests and eagerly accepts for both of them. She insists to Artie that they have to be on their best behavior with Alice and the children because Diane no longer wants to be ""the other grandparents"" whom her grandchildren barely know.I love Billy Crystal and Bette Midler, whom I personally consider comedy-flick royalty. My husband and I rented this movie because we couldn't resist seeing what they'd do to redeem the many groan-worthy cliches of slapstick, family movies, where the main source of ""laughs"" relies on the antics of out-of-control kids and pets who utterly trash their home one or more times during the course of the movie, and multiple other venues as well. I've never found that type of movie funny, and I was relieved to discover that: (a) there is no elephant-sized, destructive dog running rampant in this movie--there are no criminally untrained pets at all, and (b) there is only one scene in which the kids make a horrible mess, and they don't produce any property damage while doing it. Everything can be fixed with nothing more than a good scrub with soap and water.Billy Crystal is unquestionably the star of this show, but Bette Midler is a close second. Each makes the most of every potentially humorous line, and their interactions with each other are consistent, comic gold as both are equally capable of performing as the funny guy or the straight man.Marisa Tomei (My Cousin Vinny) does a terrific job as a harried daughter, mother and wife, who just wants to do the best she can with all the conflicting demands on her from her family.Tom Everett Scott (That Thing You Do!) puts in a solid, appealing performance in the thankless role of the father of the family. I admired the fact that he doesn't resort to the clich&eacute; of clueless scientific genius. Instead he portrays his character as a sensitive, fully-involved father who's every woman's dream for a co-parent.The three children are amazing actors, all of them, and they are each so utterly adorable, every woman in the audience will want to pinch their plump, rosy cheeks. Joshua Rush and Kyle Harrison Breitkopf were both nominated for the Young Artist Award as Best Supporting Young Actor Age Ten and Under in a Feature Film for this movie. In addition, all three of the children were nominated for the Young Artist Award for Best Performance in a Feature Film in a Young Ensemble Cast for this movie.Finally, I want to commend the hilarious performance of Rhoda Griffis (I know her best in the part of bitchy Lenore Baker Ludwig on the TV show, Army Wives). In the role of Harper's harsh, Russian violin teacher, Dr. Schveer, her interactions with Bette Midler are priceless.This is an ideal, G-rated, family film. There is something for everyone, young, middle aged and old. There are plenty of laughs, and several places made me cry, not from sadness but because the film is so moving.Highly recommended.",4,A must-watch for fans of Billy Crystal and Bette

1512181,A18HHKM6WGEF9D,B0067EKYL8,"L. Erickson ""Mommy Mystic""","[1, 1]","I watched this film with my husband, three children ages 6-9, and father, and it was perfect for a multi-generational evening together. Billy Crystal and Bette Midler play the parents of Marisa Tomei's character, and grandparents to her 3 kids. Her husband has won a big award and wants her to go away with him to accept it, but she's never left the kids, and is loathe to leave them with her parents. She eventually does, and both calamity and insight follow as the grandparents and kids move to a new level in their relationship. The humor mostly centers on the differences in generational parenting - Tomei's character tells her parents ""We don't say 'no' or 'don't', we say 'think of the consequences' or 'try it this way.'""

It wasn't a sad movie by any means just a very sweet, loving movie about family.I am a huge fan the actors in this movie, I have loved Bette since The Divine Miss M (one of my favorite albums) and Billy Crystal, well there's Monsters Inc but more than that he's Billy Friggin Crystal. City Slickers is one of my favorite comedies.  After that we have Marisa Tomei (Different World and My Cousin Vinny) and little Bailee Madison who has turned into a beautiful young lady!In Parental Guidance, Phil and Alice Simmons (Tom Everett and Marisa Tomei) are flying out because Tom's product is being recognized. They haven't been on vacation in years and talk of leaving one set of their parents in charge of the kids while they are away.  Artie and Diane (Alice's parents) agree to watch the kids much to Alice's surprise. Artie was recently laid off of his much loved sports announcing job. Their different parenting styles surface early on and Alice has a hard time leaving.  When she finally leaves the grandparents in charge much mayhem ensues and the comedy is mixed with magical moments between the grandparents and the children. It is a great movie for the entire family.Parental Guidance is a wonderful look at two generations different parenting styles and the effects as such. As parents we think we are doing things so much better than our parents generation but when it comes down to it, are we? Our childhoods were filled with imagination and wonder yet our children are now used to helicopter parents who micromanage their every move. There were some moments in the movie that really had me thinking that our parents generation knew what they were doing.

He takes it more or less as an opportunity to pursue his dream, as a San Francisco Giants announcer!Bette Midler plays Marisa's Mom (and plays the occasionally exasperated feminist Wife - creating just a little confusion when she encourages the 12 year old daughter to dress to impress...16 year old boys). MT is a Mom, too, a ""working Mom"" of a bunch of severely screwed up ""modern"" kids, who have no traditional Parental Guidance other than playing their own parent, albeit a very strict parent, nutritionally and culturally and otherwise.Grandparents Billy and Bette are also kind of in the ""minor leagues"". They can never be in the same class as Marisa's spouse's parents. But they are summoned to watch the inspired brats while their parents go off to a business vacation. They decide, this time around, to learn 'em the ""old fashioned way"".Before long, the two sons and the one daughter are devouring anniversary cake, urinating in public, watching Gramps vomit on a little leaguer, going to wild parties.The story doesn't matter, but I'll play no spoiler here. Plus, the one saving grace is Crystal's often hilarious bits and pieces, some I presume adlibs. He looks great and gets the best closeups of the movie, as nice as Marisa and Bette look. He and Marisa - very conservatively dressed, sorry dudes - pull off some dandy sight gags, too. Baseball themes work in well.

Rated PG so, if you are looking for a film to share with your family during family get-togethers,  here's a perfect choice. chance. Our youth critics' full reviews follow:""Parental Guidance""Reviewed by Brianna Hope BeatonVideo reviews available at kidsfirst dot org.""Parental Guidance"" is extremely funny and enjoyable. Artie Decker (Billy Crystal) is let go from his baseball announcing job which he truly loves. His only daughter, Alice Simmons (Marisa Tomei) and her husband Phil Simmons (Tom Everett Scott) get a chance to go on a vacation and need someone to look after their three school-age kids. Artie and his wife Diane Decker (Bette Midler) agree to look after them for a week and will do anything to not be  the ""other grandparents."" But, their style of parenting clashes with Alice and her husband's parenting ways.This film kept me laughing a lot and I must admit,  I shedded a few tears. My favorite character is Barker Simmons (Kyle Harrison Breitkopf). He has the cutest little face with red curly hair, and cracks me up with some of the things he does. The acting is really good and believable. I can actually see this plot happening in real life - that's how believable it is. I also like Harper Simmons (Bailee Madison) as she acts very well. She is so intense with her acting and so believable with her crying scenes.I have two favorite scenes. One is when Harper has a mouthful of cake and then says to her mother, ""yogurt is not like ice cream, you lied."" The other is when Artie is at the little league baseball game with his daughter and causes trouble because there is no 3 strike game rule.Andy Fickman directs ""Parental Guidance"" and Lisa Addario along with Joe Syracuse who wrote this very funny script. Other talents include Jennifer Crystal Foley, Rhonda Griffis and the very funny Gedde Watanabe.A lesson in this film is to live your life, love yourself and laugh a lot. I recommend ""Parental Guidance"" for ages 6 and up. This is a great film for the family and your friends to see. It's a really good comedy that will keep you laughing. Get ready to laugh, cry and have a good time.I give this film 5 out of 5 five stars.  I love the actors, the plot and comedy. Billy Crystal and Bette Midler are hilarious together with their style of parenting. Have some fun with your grandparents and see ""Parental Guidance."" I'm sure you will love it.""Parental Guidance""Reviewed by Cheyenne NguyenVideo reviews available at kidsfirst dot orgI love this movie. It has something that every age group can relate to. Artie (Billy Crystal) and Dianne (Bette Midler) are asked by their daughter Alice (Marisa Tomei) to watch her three kids for one week. Alice and her husband have won a trip for two to celebrate their success. However, Alice wants Artie and Dianne to use her method of parenting not the old school way that Artie and Dianne used to raise her. The children are Harper (Bailee Madison), Turner (Joshua Rush) and Barker (Kyle Breitkopf). They are not to have any sugar and live a very structured life. Each has their own issues. Artie and Dianne have to learn how to deal with their issues using the 21st century method.Billy Crystal owns his character. I really see Billy Crystal as Artie. I did not see any acting with this character. Bette Midler also does a great job as Diane, funny and great voice. Artie and Dianne's lines seems like they are improvised and their comic timing is awesome. The child actors are great too. Harper's look of awkwardness when her crush asks her to his party is so true to life. Turner's speech impediment is so real; I thought he really has the impediment. Barker is a riot; he has that face that looks as if he's up to something.The movie quality is very clear. The props for the smart house are awesome. One day we will all have a smart house and our parents will think it's creepy. The small home town setting looks just like it's in Fresno, California.My favorite character is Turner.

True, it wasn't anything particularly deep, complex, or emotional and it was also a bit predictable and cliched, but it was absolutely hilarious and I liked almost all of the characters! It was written by Lisa Addario and Joe Syracuse and directed by Andy Fickman, all of whom I've never heard of before. It stars Billy Crystal and Bette Midler as Artie and Diane Decker, two old school grandparents who are looking after their daughter's kids for the week, all of whom have issues they need to overcome. I could pretty much predict the entire film, with a few exceptions, but I still enjoyed it for the most part, there were a few jokes here and there that I wasn't particularly fond of but overall it was a good film. Bailee Madison as Harper plays a young violinist who tends to take things too seriously, Joshua Rush, as Turner, has stuttering issues to overcome, and the youngest kid Barker, played by Kyle Harrison Breitkopf, is somewhat annoying and one of the few characters I didn't like too much in the film, alongside the overbearing mother Alice, played by Marisa Tomei. Parental Guidance is a breath of fresh air when it comes to modern American comedy. Most comedies nowadays tend to be more like Project X, Superbad, or Knocked Up, but Parental Guidance is fun for the whole family and I respect that! It didn't have to be crude or offensive to get laughs, and that alone keeps it from anything less than a 3 star rating! It makes me almost not care about how predictable it is, although there were a few vulgar jokes, for the most part it was clean. Some critics actually derided this film for being inoffensive, I find that very hard to believe and am disgusted that America has sunk so low to have a criticism like that!

I have always enjoyed Bette Midler's work, and thought with her teamed up with Billy Crystal, the film would have to be funny. I was so wrong. The film is about three kids that are catered to 24/7, and all the adults in their world that spend their lives catering to them. The children are rude and disrespectful, and allowed to throw one tantrum after another because Artie, played by Crystal, DARED to try to impose any limits on their behavior, or to tell them NO. The youngest little cretin ruined a symphony performance, in only one example of his behavior, and still Artie was chastised for even implying that discipline would result. All the adults spent all their time apologizing to the children, when the children, specifically the youngest, were the ones that had done wrong, and should have been taught that they were doing wrong. Sadly, this kind of ""non parenting"" has become prevalent, where the children are in charge of the adults and the household, and it's doing no one any favors, least of all the children. I don't know how Crystal's character could have told Tomei's character that she was a ""good mother,"" with a straight face. Non parenting, and allowing horrible behavior, is being the worst kid of parent. Bribing the children with cake and money was pretty bad grandparenting as well, and I didn't like how Midler's character kept ragging on Crystal for trying to discipline the children, and ruining her chance to be the ""fun"" grandmother.I did feel for the oldest child, who was being pushed into devoting her entire life to playing the violin. It is ironic, that the film was about ""parents making sure that children are heard"" yet no one heard that child.I guess that some people thought the movie was funny, if they like seeing horrible monster children being as horrible as possible while their mother looks on lovingly, and seeing zero respect for any adults exhibited or expected, and seeing all the adults crawling around catering to and placating the children. I didn't think it was funny.

Although a comedy, it was a little low key; a comedy of observation comparing modern day parenting to traditional parenting, with not too much over-the-top humor (albiet there was some bathroom humor so prevalent in most comedy movies these days). Also, we haven't seen Billy Crystal, Bette Midler or even Marisa Tomei in anything for a while. Crystal and Midler have pretty good on-screen comic chemistry as grandparent characters to Tomei's  daughter character's 3 children (who were not too annoying). The comic situations developed for the film are not too straining or forced, with set-ups that can almost can happen in the real world. This reviewer found this film a pleasant surprise and found it a very relaxing film to watch with an intermittent amount of chuckling here and there to get through the film.

Better Midler and Billy Crystal play a long-married couple, Diane (Midler) and Artie (Crystal) who step in when they are called on to help care for their three grandchildren while their parents, Alice (Marisa Tomei) and Phil (Tom Everett Scott) go on a work/holiday trip. Alice is super anxious that her parents will make a mess of things, especially her father Artie because both her parents' parenting styles are way more different than her and Phil's avant garde version of parenting (not using ""No"", replacing it instead with strange phrases like ""Use your words"" etc.). The three children are a mixed lot - there's high-achieving, high-strung teenager Harper (Bailee Madison) who aspires to be a violinist with the Atlanta Youth Symphony, eight-year-old Turner (Joshua Rush) who has a stutter and is undergoing very expensive therapy to correct it, and the youngest, five-year-old Barker (Kyle Harrison Breitkopf) who has no sense of boundaries and has an imaginary friend, a kangaroo named Carl.The fun begins when the grandparents arrive - Artie has just lost his job and is hoping to land some auditions whilst visiting with the grandkids, a decision that puts him and Barker in some awkward and funny situations. Diane forms an easy bond with Harper and under her gentle guidance, Harper blossoms into a more confident young woman and relaxes a little. Artie makes many missteps along the way but does bond with the two boys, and the grandparents and grandchildren end up having a whale of a time.I wouldn't say the movie is funny throughout but there are some great laugh-out loud scenes and of course the requisite poignant ones that had me tearing up.
