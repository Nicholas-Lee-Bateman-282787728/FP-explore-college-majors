1673797,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00FZ4KR4U,Andrew Ellington,"[27, 34]","When the credits finished rolling on &#8216;Enough Said&#8217; and the words &#8216;For Jim&#8217; came on the screen, I shed a tear.  The shock of Gandolfini&#8217;s death and the impact it has had on me as a fan is still hard to take, and I have to say that watching him in &#8216;Enough Said&#8217; was one of those bittersweet moments.  It was sweet, because this is, without a single doubt, the greatest performance he&#8217;s ever given.  It was bitter because I knew that I&#8217;d never see him tap into this side of himself again.I seriously want to cry right now.The power of Gandolfini&#8217;s performance comes from the fact that he is not acting here, at all.  He&#8217;s simply living this performance, and he completely wins the audience over.  While the ensemble as a whole is wonderful, Gandolfini is in a league all his own.  Julia Louis-Dreyfus is hilarious, and yet where she is obviously reaching for those moments (she gets them, but you can see her reaching), Gandolfini just sits back and lets it all roll off of his natural charm and charisma.  He never has to reach out for anything, it just comes to him.  Toni Collette (the best I&#8217;ve seen her in years), Catherine Keener (always a joy) and Ben Falcone work with Holofcener&#8217;s rich dialog and character development with ease, but none with the ease of Gandolfini, who delivers one of my favorite performances of the year.&#8216;Enough Said&#8217; is not the best film I&#8217;ve seen this year, but it is probably my favorite, and that says a lot.  No film so far this year has given so much JOY while watching it.  I never stopped smiling.  Even when I was crying (and that happened a few times) I was still smiling.  I also never have ever in my life wanted a clich&eacute;d happy ending so badly.Like seriously, I was praying for one.&#8216;Enough Said&#8217; tells the beautiful story of Eva, a divorced mother and massage therapist dreading the idea of her daughter moving off to college.  At a party she meets two people, Marianne and Albert.  Marianne is a poet who is in need of a massage and wants someone to complain about her ex-husband to.  Albert is that ex-husband, in need of a new start in life.  Eva winds up being the best thing that ever happened to either of them, but as she listens to Marianne go on and on about how awful Albert is, her relationship with the otherwise charming and sensible man becomes tarnished.  Can she really maintain both relationships, and what is it about Marianne and her bounty of complaints that keeps Eva coming back for more, when she so obviously has fallen for Albert?While watching &#8216;Enough Said&#8217; I couldn&#8217;t help but think that this is everything that last years &#8216;Hope Springs&#8217; should have been, but wasn&#8217;t.  Love at middle age should not be hard to watch, but should be celebrated and loved.  While this film is hilarious (seriously, the whole first half of the film is one giant batch of wit and charm) but the relationship between Albert and Eva never becomes a joke, even when we are supposed to laugh at their awkward bedroom antics.  This relationship and all the weight it carries is taken seriously.  That is the beauty of &#8216;Enough Said&#8217;, because it feels so richly understood and it knows exactly what it is trying to convey, and it does just that.",5,Saying goodbye to a cinematic treasure&#8230;,1383523200,"11 4, 2013",2013,3346,"['When', 'credits', 'finished', 'rolling', '8216', 'Enough', 'Said', '8217', 'words', '8216', 'Jim', '8217', 'came', 'screen', 'shed', 'tear', 'shock', 'Gandolfini', '8217', 'death', 'impact', 'had', 'fan', 'still', 'hard', 'take', 'have', 'say', 'watching', '8216', 'Enough', 'Said', '8217', 'was', 'one', 'bittersweet', 'moments', 'was', 'sweet', 'single', 'doubt', 'greatest', 'performance', '8217', 'ever', 'given', 'was', 'bitter', 'knew', '8217', 'd', 'never', 'see', 'tap', 'side', 'again.I', 'seriously', 'want', 'cry', 'right', 'now.The', 'power', 'Gandolfini', '8217', 's', 'performance', 'fact', 'not', 'acting', 'here', '8217', 'simply', 'living', 'performance', 'completely', 'audience', 'ensemble', 'whole', 'wonderful', 'Gandolfini', 'league', 'own', 'Julia', 'Louis-Dreyfus', 'hilarious', 'yet', 'where', 'obviously', 'reaching', 'moments', 'can', 'see', 'reaching', 'Gandolfini', 'just', 'back', 'roll', 'natural', 'charm', 'charisma', 'never', 'reach', 'out', 'anything', 'just', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'best', '8217', 've', 'seen', 'years', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'always', 'joy', 'Ben', 'Falcone', 'work', 'Holofcener', '8217', 'rich', 'dialog', 'character', 'development', 'ease', 'none', 'ease', 'Gandolfini', 'who', 'one', 'favorite', 'performances', 'year.', '8216', 'Enough', 'Said', '8217', 'not', 'best', 'film', '8217', 'seen', 'year', 'probably', 'favorite', 'lot', 'film', 'so', 'far', 'year', 'given', 'so', 'much', 'JOY', 'watching', 'never', 'stopped', 'smiling', 'Even', 'when', 'was', 'crying', 'happened', 'few', 'times', 'was', 'still', 'smiling', 'also', 'never', 'have', 'ever', 'life', 'wanted', 'clich', 'eacute', 'happy', 'ending', 'so', 'badly.Like', 'seriously', 'was', 'praying', 'one.', '8216', 'Enough', 'Said', '8217', 'beautiful', 'story', 'Eva', 'divorced', 'mother', 'massage', 'therapist', 'dreading', 'idea', 'daughter', 'moving', 'off', 'college', 'party', 'two', 'people', 'Marianne', 'Albert', 'Marianne', 'poet', 'who', 'need', 'massage', 'someone', 'complain', 'ex-husband', 'Albert', 'ex-husband', 'need', 'new', 'start', 'life', 'Eva', 'up', 'being', 'best', 'thing', 'ever', 'happened', 'Marianne', 'go', 'how', 'awful', 'Albert', 'relationship', 'otherwise', 'charming', 'sensible', 'man', 'tarnished', 'Can', 'really', 'maintain', 'relationships', 'what', 'Marianne', 'bounty', 'complaints', 'keeps', 'Eva', 'coming', 'back', 'more', 'when', 'so', 'obviously', 'fallen', 'Albert', 'watching', '8216', 'Enough', 'Said', '8217', 'couldn', '8217', 'help', 'think', 'everything', 'last', 'years', '8216', 'Hope', 'Springs', '8217', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'wasn', '8217', 'Love', 'middle', 'age', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'hard', 'watch', 'should', 'be', 'celebrated', 'loved', 'film', 'hilarious', 'seriously', 'whole', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'one', 'giant', 'batch', 'wit', 'charm', 'relationship', 'Albert', 'Eva', 'never', 'joke', 'even', 'when', 'are', 'supposed', 'laugh', 'awkward', 'bedroom', 'antics', 'relationship', 'weight', 'taken', 'seriously', 'beauty', '8216', 'Enough', 'Said', '8217', 'so', 'richly', 'understood', 'exactly', 'what', 'trying', 'convey', 'just']",N/A

1673799,A3QNER0M9CJ22N,B00FZ4KR4U,"Anna Robb ""SaraShaw""","[0, 0]","This movie starts out looking strong. We are introduced to Eva, a beautiful woman, who has her own business and a daughter about to leave for college.  Eva attends a party and is introduced to two new people... one, a woman looks to be a new client and friend and the other... perhaps a new boyfriend. Eva gets to like the new guy, Albert, even as she listens to her new female friend and client complain about her ex husband. Guess who that turns out to be? Eventually Eva is forced to try to keep her like for Albert in the face of listening to his ex-wife complain about him all the time.The problem with this movie for me is Albert and Gandolfini. Just like in the &#34;Holiday&#34; I am sick of Hollywood hooking up great looking women with HORRIBLY out of shape guys - like they are trying to train women not to want better in real life.  Also note that Catherine Keener is supposed to have been his ex. Gandolfini looks very bad here. Overweight and not attractive. Compare John Candy in &#34;only the lonely&#34; for a &#34;non-traditional&#34; larger guy who makes you believe someone would be attracted to him. Albert's character turns out to be very boring and does most of what his ex is complaining about. I can't see any reason for Eva to be with him other than total desperation.  When Albert finds out that Eva knew his ex and said nothing he is up on the high horse like Eva cheated on him or something.  Really doesn't rise to the level of a deep betrayal.  And I am not sure I get it as Eva seemed to want to stay with Albert even hearing bad things about him all the time. It isn't like she broke up with Albert after hearing from his ex.Some have said that Eva was supposed to be unlikable but I didn't get it. The movie tries to portray her as that but almost everything she gets taken to task for in the movie seems unfair. She gets in trouble for being friendly with her daughter's friend... she was just trying to be nice and understandably looking to blunt the loss of her daughter going to college. Really? Is that so bad?Overall though, I don't enjoy spending 2 hours with uninteresting people so I will probably never watch this again.

1673823,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B00FZ4KR4U,California Dreaming,"[0, 0]","This film is about inappropriate relationships, and the damage that those relationships cause.  Julia Louis-Dreyfus has quite a few of these herself:  the wife of her current boyfriend, the friend of her daughter, her ex-husband, etc.  Let's face it:  the friend of my enemy is my enemy, whether people like it or not.  And the friend of my frenemy is, well, probably a frenemy.I knew this woman once who maintained relationships with all of her ex-husbands (yes, there were way more than one; you could barely count them on one hand) and it was pretty obvious that her latest husband didn't much like it.  He didn't say it, but you could see it.  Anyways, she kept those relationships going not because they were necessarily healthy, but rather to keep her husband on a short leash.  She wanted him to know that he could be replaced, and more than likely, he would be someday; let history be his guide.  But I always had the feeling that she was hedging her bets, just in case the latest became not-the-greatest.And this movie is more than hinting at these types of relationships.  Sometimes, you need to drop a relationship with someone because it does damage to a third party, and ultimately, yourself.  You can always try to argue that those relationships are harmless, but you know that they aren't.  In a perfect world, people wouldn't have jealousies and insecurities, but we don't live in a perfect world.But Ms. Dreyfus surprisingly almost gives a perfect performance herself.  At first, yes, I thought about her character Elaine on ""Seinfeld.""  Who doesn't?  But after awhile, you will realize that it's quite unfortunate that she's become somewhat type-cast, and has probably not gotten roles because of it.  She is certainly more talented than I thought, before watching her spot-on performance in ""Enough Said.""And James Gandolfini puts on quite a show himself, showing range from his ""Sopranos"" days.  He was a tough guy there, while he is a softy here, in more ways that one.  But when you have a film that seats Catherine Keener and Toni Collette at second and third fiddle, you know that the ensemble should be music to your ears.  And it is.I'll go with a big recommendation on a film that I believe would pair nicely with ""Sideways"" on a double bill.

He's divorced from Marianne, a poet with her own emotional luggage. Their snobby daughter is soon headed off to college. Enter Eva (played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus) who is also divorced and has a daughter headed off to college. Both Albert and Marianne meet Eva at a party, learning that she is a massage therapist. This puts Eva into their lives, opening the possibility for zany conundrums since Marianne blabs about Albert, who soon becomes Eva's boyfriend.There are no real &#34;high spots&#34; in this movie. It trundles along, carried by the performances of top actors like Gandolfini and Luis-Dreyfus, as well as Katherine Keener. Nonetheless, the comic spots shine as natural, even as the dialog sometimes slips into the mundane. Dinner parties, massage sessions, visits to restaurants all open wounds old and new as the sore points of relationships rise to the surface. In these settings, this top-notch cast really shines, as they pull off the interactions without ever hinting that they're acting. It might be a hidden camera your watching for how natural it is.Among the main plot is the subtext of having one's children move on with their lives, something that affects Albert and Eva deeply. The empty nest syndrome looms for them, to the point where Eva invites her daughters friend (who is not going to college) to move in. A bit of conflict pops up here and could have used more development as an underlying theme.The biggest surprise for me was Gandolfini playing against type.

But there's a particular danger of reverting to adolescent idiocy when we hit middle-age.  The usual trigger for people is the &#34;empty-nest syndrome&#34;, and our tentative lovers in this picture are suffering from it each in their own way, with predictably cringe-worthy results.  A man and a woman, each divorced and preparing to send their same-age daughters off to different and rather hoity-toity colleges (although Gandolfini's daughter informs us that &#34;Sarah Lawrence isn't what it used to be&#34;), meet at a party.  Louis-Dreyfus' friend, after introductions, tactlessly tells Gandolfini that Louis-Dreyfus admitted to not being attracted to any man at the party, to which Gandolfini replies smoothly, &#34;Me neither.&#34;  Gandolfini's a smoothie with a quick wit that compensates for his weight problem, and Louis-Dreyfus needs some laughs in her life.  They both need companionship.  It's been a long time since we've seen a relatively mainstream release depict a relationship in such a true-to-life manner.  This over-experienced pair push, probe, pull back from each other, dancing around deeper intimacy but never quite plunging in.  Wit is the preferred defense mechanism.  &#34;I'm tired of being funny,&#34; Gandolfini sleepily tells Louis-Dreyfus while they're in bed.  &#34;You're funny?&#34; she zings back.  Holofcener is a great writer.Louis-Dreyfus is a masseuse, and an apparently successful one, given the house she lives in and the fancy college her daughter's soon to attend.  In Saginaw, Michigan, this would not be believable; but we're in L.A., so it works.  We often see her lugging her massage table down a sidewalk and up steep stairs (film students, take note: this is what is known as a &#34;metaphor&#34;).  Unfortunately for her, she discovers that one of her clients is Gandolfini's ex-wife, Catherine Keener.  Now Keener doesn't know Louis-Dreyfus is seeing Gandolfini, but just through conversation she manages to poison the budding romance by supplying Louis-Dreyfus with endless details about how annoying Gandolfini is.  I won't describe the rest of the plot, but let it be said that writer-director Nicole Holofcener is as meticulous with story construction as she is with witty dialogue.  We know the THUD is coming, and we're waiting with amusement and dread for how the Big Reveal is handled.  In the event, we're not disappointed.Performances?  Gandolfini serves up an emotionally controlled performance, delivering Holofcener's zingers, of which she supplies him with about 2 dozen, with perfect timing.  We can see why Louis-Dreyfus falls for him, whether or not he possesses bed-tables.  But it was Louis-Dreyfus who stunned me.  I've not watched some of her more recent cable/network offerings (&#34;Veep&#34;, &#34;New Adventures of Old Christine&#34;) but if she has been doing dramatic work on those programs, then shame on me for being surprised by what a superb actor she is.  I just remember her pathologically shallow &#34;Elaine&#34; from &#34;Seinfeld&#34;, and even further back in the early 80s on &#34;Saturday Night Live&#34;.  I didn't realize she did other things besides farce.  There is not a single scene here that could have been performed better by another woman.  To many, she'll always be &#34;Elaine&#34;, but this role is the performance of her life.Holofcener has slowly been building a great career over the past decade, and the small measure of commercial success &#34;Enough Said&#34; has enjoyed is a long-overdue reward for her honest stories and sparkling writing.

1673856,A2GPLOLLE6BUDT,B00FZ4KR4U,Dave,"[1, 3]","James Gandolfini's last role was one of a wonderful, affable and simple slob.  His character was that of a guy one would want for a friend, but also one that would defy women who have a need to change the men in their lives.  His personality initially and cautiously attracts Dreyfus who unknowingly takes on Gandolfini's ex-wife as a massage client and Dreyfus unprofessionally becomes a friend and a confidant to her.  The loquacious ex-wife shares with Dreyfus her annoyances with Gandolfini that led to their divorce.  Dreyfus soon becomes critical of Gandolfini's mannerisms that his ex-wife found intolerable.  The intolerance of the ex-wife finds its way into the actions of Dreyfus almost through osmosis, and because of this, Dreyfus becomes such an annoying character (made even more annoying by Dreyfus' perfect portrayal) that I found myself becoming intolerant of Dreyfus.  My induced dislike of Dreyfus' character spoiled what few moments of enjoyment I experienced early in the film.  By the film's end, I was feeling such annoyance that I thought I would have been better off not having viewed any of it.The Acting in this film is very good and supporting actors not only aptly develop their own characters but skillfully serve to expand the dimensions of the main characters and their effects upon others in the film.  I suppose the script was very good at delivering the intended story and message.  What I do not understand is why put such talent, intellect and energy into such a poor outcome.In conclusion, this film was a comedy only in the sense that it was not a tragedy.  I smiled a few times early in the film, but I never laughed.  Of all of the sentiments I might have after viewing a film, annoyance is the only one I personally cannot accept as an intended result, regardless of any excellence that may have surfaced during its viewing.  Some might think of this film as a date movie, but I think such a categorization would only apply if one is foolishly attempting to test the strength of a budding relationship.

1673857,AUEHG0DB54B7K,B00FZ4KR4U,David A. Wend,"[7, 11]","Enough Said is a  typical romantic comedy following the pattern of boy meets girl, boy and girl separate and boy and girl get back together.  What makes Enough Said an interesting film are the performances of James Gandolfini (as Albert) and Julia Louis-Dreyfus (as Julia), as an unlikely couple. Both are middle-aged with one marriage behind them and have a daughter.  It is also a film about letting go as Julia's daughter is about to go away to college, and she finds the change in her life less than easy to cope with.The interesting plot twist of the film is that Julia (who is a masseuse) has also met a poet named Marianne (played by Catherine Kenner) who turns out to be Albert's ex-wife.  Julia and Marianne bond together and she becomes one of Julia's clients. But, when Marianne relates many complaints she had for her former spouse to Julia, she is conflicted about continuing to date Albert and telling Marianne the truth about her relationship.Enough Said is a down-to-earth film, brilliantly written and directed by Nicole Holofcener.  The film will certainly resonate with all of the divorced, middle-aged members of the audience (among which my wife and I can count us).  The characters are very real and I would say are based in real life experiences. Enough Said, like all good romantic comedies, has its share of laughs and heartaches.  Julia Louis-Dreyfus is wonderfully serious and funny in her role as she travels to her clients, toting her massage table with her sometimes with humorous effect.  The mark of a great performance is if an actor can convince you they are the role they are playing. James Gandolfini succeeds in convincing us he is an insecure, middle-aged man who is giving love a second chance.  He brings to his role simplicity and directness that makes acting look easy. Toni Collete has a great part as Julia's close friend and there are some funny moments between her and Ben Falcone, who plays her husband Will. Enough Said is an engaging film that will be memorable long after you leave the theater.",5,A Wonderful Bittersweet Romanic Comedy,1382659200,"10 25, 2013",2013,2044,"['Enough', 'Said', 'typical', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'following', 'pattern', 'boy', 'meets', 'girl', 'boy', 'girl', 'separate', 'boy', 'girl', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'What', 'Enough', 'Said', 'interesting', 'film', 'are', 'performances', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'Albert', 'Julia', 'Louis-Dreyfus', 'Julia', 'unlikely', 'couple', 'are', 'middle-aged', 'one', 'marriage', 'have', 'daughter', 'also', 'film', 'letting', 'go', 'Julia', 'daughter', 'go', 'away', 'college', 'change', 'life', 'less', 'easy', 'cope', 'with.The', 'interesting', 'plot', 'twist', 'film', 'Julia', 'who', 'masseuse', 'also', 'met', 'poet', 'named', 'Marianne', 'played', 'Catherine', 'Kenner', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'Albert', 'ex-wife', 'Julia', 'Marianne', 'bond', 'together', 'one', 'Julia', 'clients', 'when', 'Marianne', 'many', 'complaints', 'had', 'former', 'spouse', 'Julia', 'conflicted', 'continuing', 'date', 'Albert', 'telling', 'Marianne', 'truth', 'relationship.Enough', 'Said', 'down-to-earth', 'film', 'brilliantly', 'written', 'directed', 'Nicole', 'Holofcener', 'film', 'will', 'certainly', 'resonate', 'divorced', 'middle-aged', 'members', 'audience', 'wife', 'can', 'count', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'real', 'would', 'say', 'are', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'experiences', 'Enough', 'Said', 'good', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'share', 'laughs', 'heartaches', 'Julia', 'Louis-Dreyfus', 'wonderfully', 'serious', 'funny', 'role', 'clients', 'toting', 'massage', 'table', 'sometimes', 'humorous', 'effect', 'mark', 'great', 'performance', 'actor', 'can', 'convince', 'are', 'role', 'are', 'playing', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'convincing', 'insecure', 'middle-aged', 'man', 'who', 'giving', 'love', 'second', 'chance', 'role', 'simplicity', 'directness', 'acting', 'look', 'easy', 'Toni', 'Collete', 'great', 'part', 'Julia', 'close', 'friend', 'are', 'funny', 'moments', 'Ben', 'Falcone', 'who', 'husband', 'Will', 'Enough', 'Said', 'engaging', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'memorable', 'long', 'leave', 'theater']",N/A

Writer-director Nicole Holofcener has crafted a work that is both insightful and funny.  The film portrays two people who were hurt in previous relationships who walk with trepidation before entering another one.  It's interesting how these people would take something as insignificant as how somebody eats guacamole or butters their popcorn and blow it out of proportion.  Ideally cast are Julia Louis-Dreyfus and James Gandolfini as two people in the middle of life who tread carefully in the arena that is love.  The chemistry between the two cannot be overstated.  Think Tracy and Hepburn, Bogart and Bacall, Wayne and O'Hara, Allen and Keaton that's how good they are.  I don't know if it was a challenge for them because both Louis-Dreyfus and Gandolfini are usually associated with different type fare but light romance fits them to a tee.  If I were to find fault with the film, and it's a minor quibble, is that I found the plot device involving Gandolfini's ex-wife played by Catherine Keener unnecessary and a distraction.  This character seemed a little loopy to me and any information coming from her suspect.

1673877,AC1K4OQOZ90RS,B00FZ4KR4U,"E. Bukowsky ""booklover10""","[7, 11]","""Enough Said,"" written and directed by Nicole Holofcener, is a bittersweet romantic comedy about two lonely people who reach out to one another at a critical point in their lives. Both Eva (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), a self-employed masseuse, and Albert (James Gandolfini), are divorced; each has a daughter who is about to leave home for college. Louis-Dreyfus plays Eva, a neurotic and insecure woman with terrible judgment. After Eva starts dating Albert, she makes a startling discovery that throws her for a loop.Holofcener's understated script contains a tinge of melancholy since, as a divorced mom with kids, she probably knows from personal experience that parenting a teenager alone is not easy. Gandolfini is wonderful as a portly middle-aged man, firmly set in his ways and uninterested in a makeover. Albert enjoys calorie-laden meals and sheepishly admits that he is a slob. Eva enjoys Albert's gentle and self-deprecating humor, intelligence, and easygoing manner but soon grows irritated by his flaws. Catherine Keener is impressive as an elegant and attractive poet, Marianne, who becomes Eva's client; Marianne loves venting about her ex-husband to Eva. Complicating matters further is Eva's reluctance to let go of her daughter, Ellen, the only person in her life whom she can rely on for unconditional affection.Louis-Dreyfus, a terrific physical comedienne, comically lugs around a heavy massage table from client to client. Viewers cannot help but wince as they watch this petite masseuse climb up endless stairs on her way to a young male client who never offers to help. ""Enough Said"" is, in some ways, painful to watch, since the director calls attention to the fault lines in our lives with such clarity and insight. Eva's friend, Sarah, a psychotherapist, is herself in need of therapy (her marriage is far from perfect), and Marianne, a woman with impeccable taste, is self-absorbed and impatient with those who do not meet her lofty standards.Holofcener has a great deal to say about the ways in which we make our lives unnecessarily difficult. She implies that people who are forgiving, have realistic expectations, and are not overly critical stand the best chance at rebuilding their lives after a disastrous first marriage. ""Enough Said"" is a poignant and, at times, agonizing look at the self-destructive behavior of individuals who foolishly impede their own happiness.",5,"""He's not handsome in your typical kind of way....""",1382918400,"10 28, 2013",2013,2399,"['Enough', 'Said', 'written', 'directed', 'Nicole', 'Holofcener', 'bittersweet', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'two', 'lonely', 'people', 'who', 'reach', 'one', 'critical', 'point', 'lives', 'Eva', 'Julia', 'Louis-Dreyfus', 'self-employed', 'masseuse', 'Albert', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'are', 'divorced', 'daughter', 'who', 'leave', 'home', 'college', 'Louis-Dreyfus', 'plays', 'Eva', 'neurotic', 'insecure', 'woman', 'terrible', 'judgment', 'Eva', 'dating', 'Albert', 'startling', 'discovery', 'loop.Holofcener', 'understated', 'script', 'tinge', 'melancholy', 'divorced', 'mom', 'kids', 'probably', 'personal', 'experience', 'parenting', 'teenager', 'alone', 'not', 'easy', 'Gandolfini', 'wonderful', 'portly', 'middle-aged', 'man', 'firmly', 'set', 'ways', 'uninterested', 'makeover', 'Albert', 'calorie-laden', 'meals', 'sheepishly', 'admits', 'slob', 'Eva', 'Albert', 'gentle', 'self-deprecating', 'humor', 'intelligence', 'easygoing', 'manner', 'soon', 'grows', 'irritated', 'flaws', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'impressive', 'elegant', 'attractive', 'poet', 'Marianne', 'who', 'Eva', 'client', 'Marianne', 'venting', 'ex-husband', 'Eva', 'Complicating', 'matters', 'further', 'Eva', 'reluctance', 'let', 'go', 'daughter', 'Ellen', 'only', 'person', 'life', 'whom', 'can', 'rely', 'unconditional', 'affection.Louis-Dreyfus', 'terrific', 'physical', 'comedienne', 'comically', 'lugs', 'heavy', 'massage', 'table', 'client', 'client', 'Viewers', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'wince', 'watch', 'petite', 'masseuse', 'climb', 'up', 'endless', 'stairs', 'way', 'young', 'male', 'client', 'who', 'never', 'help', 'Enough', 'Said', 'ways', 'painful', 'watch', 'director', 'attention', 'fault', 'lines', 'lives', 'such', 'clarity', 'insight', 'Eva', 'friend', 'Sarah', 'psychotherapist', 'need', 'therapy', 'marriage', 'far', 'perfect', 'Marianne', 'woman', 'impeccable', 'taste', 'self-absorbed', 'impatient', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'meet', 'lofty', 'standards.Holofcener', 'great', 'deal', 'say', 'ways', 'make', 'lives', 'unnecessarily', 'difficult', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'forgiving', 'have', 'realistic', 'expectations', 'are', 'not', 'overly', 'critical', 'stand', 'best', 'chance', 'rebuilding', 'lives', 'disastrous', 'first', 'marriage', 'Enough', 'Said', 'poignant', 'times', 'agonizing', 'look', 'self-destructive', 'behavior', 'individuals', 'who', 'foolishly', 'impede', 'own', 'happiness']",N/A

1673891,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00FZ4KR4U,FNDNreview,"[239, 271]","While this is still going to be a movie review, it's also one of those rare occasions where a massive amount of bias - in this case admiration, will likely overshadow anything and everything that's said about this particular film.  This is due largely to the tragic death of a man that will go down in my book (and many others) as one of the greatest actors to ever grace the big or small screen.  Of course, I'm referring to James Gandolfini - a beloved individual that was taken well before his time.  He was a man with immense talent that saw no bounds, starring in arguably the greatest television show of all-time, The Sopranos.  But, before he starred as the loveable gangster, Tony Soprano, he made his everlasting mark in films, like Get Shorty, True Romance, and The Mexican.  Since the conclusion of The Sopranos in 2007, Gandolfini took on much more reduced roles, acting in supporting roles, such as Zero Dark Thirty, Not Fade Away, and Killing Them Softly.  Thankfully, in one of his final roles, he once again takes on a starring role - in the romance film, Enough Said.Written and directed by Nicole Holofcener (Friends with Money, Please Give), Enough Said stars Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Eva, a divorced single parent working as traveling masseuse.  One night at a party, Eva meets Marianne (Catherine Kenner), a poet with an arm issue that's in need of a masseuse.  At the same party, Eva hits it off with a divorced single parent, Albert (James Gandolfini).  Eva and Albert quickly begin dating, all while Eva is nicely bonding with her new friend and client, Marianne.  It doesn't take long for Eva to discover she is unhappy with men after a bitter divorce - and has no problem criticizing her ex-husband, either.  Matters quickly become complicated when Eva realizes Albert is the ex-husband Marianne is constantly criticizing.  Unsure of how to handle the situation, it's only a matter of time before the whole situation comes to a head.  Toni Collette, Ben Falcone, Tracey Fairaway, and Tavi Gevinson also star in supporting roles.The fact that this is (most likely) James Gandolfini's second to last appearance on the big screen (final appearance will be in 2014's Nicky Deuce), a large shadow looms large over the whole film.  Much like Heath Ledger's appearance as The Joker in The Dark Knight, it's difficult to gage whether Gandolfini's work in the role of Albert is really as good as it appears to be.  I suppose the only way to pull that off would be to find someone that lives under a rock who doesn't know that man died in order to get their unbiased opinion.  Regardless, if James Gandolfini hadn't died, this film would be looked in an entirely different manner.  Still, the devastating circumstances shouldn't discount the performance of Gandolfini's co-star Julia Louis-Dreyfus.Julia Louis-Dreyfus is absolutely stunning in this film and despite the cloud overhead, she gives one of the best performances of her career.  Like Gandolfini in the role of Tony Sorprano, I'll still always look at Louis-Dreyfus as Elaine from Seinfeld - yes, even though she just won an Emmy Award for her leading role on Veep.  Regardless, there's no denying her talent for acting (as if her shelf full of Emmy Awards wasn't proof enough).  She brings an awkward, yet relatable quality to her roles, allowing her to stand out as one of Hollywood's most authentic actresses.  Regardless of the character, she simply radiates - exuding charisma and splendor.  The chemistry with her co-stars, like any cast she's ever worked with, is just marvelous - in ways that words just can't describe.  A pairing of Louis-Dreyfus and Gandolfini may seem like a complete mismatch, yet she sells the audience on the idea that these two characters have something special.While it's easy to see the brilliance of Julia Louis-Dreyfus, it's much harder to look at the character of Albert and not see James Gandolfini.  Albert is a character that's mostly content with his life, and even though he doesn't appear to be looking for love, he's obviously found someone he enjoys.  Gandolfini portrays a down-to-earth working man, and it's really unlike the majority of the role he's played in the past.  He's not a hitman, gangster, or some other form of tough guy.  He portrays a warm, loving individual that is defined by his past, but still attempting to look forward to the future.  For Tony Soprano fans, this role is a tough sell, but this is a different side of Gandolfini that rarely appeared on screen. Regardless, even in this role, it's more evident than ever that he was and always will be considered a dramatic genius.  This wonderful actor has a long reputation of conquering his characters - for better or worse, and even in his final appearances, he gives them that Gandolfini charm that his fans have fallen in love with and adored for so many years.Both Gandolfini and Louis-Dreyfus shine in these roles due to the writing and directing of Nicole Holofcener.  The characters are written with such a relaxed freedom and honesty, which encourages these two individuals to be open with one another.  But - what's a romantic drama without a little bit of drama.  Sure, the story is all too familiar, but it's executed in a way that you'll have a few laughs, not to mention wonder if Holofcener is trying to send the world a message about obesity.  The impact divorce has on individuals is certainly discussed, along with the fear people have in regards to making the same old mistakes in new relationships.  Holofcener poses an interesting question over the course of this film: would you want the inside dirt on the person you're dating if it helped you avoid making a critical mistake in your life?  It's a difficult concept to wrap your head around, but if you were put in Eva's position and had access to all the bad things someone has ever done, odds are you'd walk the same line she did.Overall, Enough Said is a talk heavy romantic comedy with two stars that initially appear to be an unlikely duo, but as they grow on you over the course of this film (and they will), it will be impossible for you not to approve of their portrayals.  This film is smartly written, well-directed, and features a cast that is nothing less than outstanding.  This isn't a role you'd expect from James Gandolfini, and it's exactly a role you'd expect from Julia Louis-Dreyfus.  And, if this were to be the last film Gandolifini ever appeared in, there would be no finer note to go out on than with this particular character.  Yes, this as a romantic comedy, so it will understandably sway towards the female audience - but even if you're a lover of everything Gandolfini and a hater of most everything romantic-based, you should still give this film your attention.  By the end, you'll be happy you did.GRADE: A-FNDNreview.com",5,"Gandolfini, Louis-Dreyfus exquisite in 'Enough Said'",1382054400,"10 18, 2013",2013,6819,"['still', 'going', 'be', 'movie', 'review',

The girl's got talent and a voice of her own that happens to resound very significantly in the middle age generation. ENOUGH SAID is a quiet, gentle, sweet, and disarming little film that is so well written it feels like being a voyeur over the back fence.Eva (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), a divorced and single parent of a teenage girl, spends her days enjoying work as a masseuse while dreading her daughter's impending departure for college. Her friend Sarah (Toni Collette) insists she go out to clubs to associate with people other than her massage clients. She meets Albert (James Gandolfini) - a sweet, funny and like-minded man who is also divorced and facing the departure of his daughter to college. The two rather nonchalantly enter a romance and Eva gains a new client - famous poet Marianne (Catherine Keener) who unloads her disappointment with the slob she had been stuck with and allows Eva, during sessions, to do likewise. It slowly becomes evident (through the interaction of Eva's and Albert's daughters as well as the complaints of Marianne), that Marianne's slob of an ex is actually Albert. Now enlightened and with a skewed view of her ability to read other people as well as her own misconceptions of what she wants in a partner pries a schism between Eva and Albert - and very wisely on Holofcener's script we are left wonder how things will end or develop.Julia Louis-Dreyfus is brilliant as is James Gandolfini whose interaction is spot-on as far as contemporary relationships are concerned. But the rest of the cast is not far behind - with Keener as radiant as ever and Colette as fine a comic foil as can be found. Not a great movie, but a very moving one!

1673932,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B00FZ4KR4U,J. Richardson,"[0, 0]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.If you had told me a year ago that one of James Gandolfini's final roles would have been in a romantic comedy, I probably wouldn't have believed you. After all, this was Tony Soprano. But sure enough, here we are a year later, and Gandolfini has done exactly that. Unfortunately, as a whole, Enough Said fails to impress, and it fails to elicit any strong emotions about either of its lead characters. In my opinion, the critical acclaim has less to do with the quality of the film, and more to do with the fact that it includes the late James Gandolfini. This is not to say that the film is terrible, but it is excruciatingly predictable, which is a huge negative for me.Meet Eva (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), a divorced mother with a daughter who is about to start college. After attending a party with some friends, Eva meets Marianne (Catherine Keener), a famous poet, and Albert (Gandolfini). Both share some strong negative opinions about their ex-partners, and both decide to start a relationship with Eva. Because Eva is a masseuse, she begins giving massages to Marianne, and at the same time starts dating Albert. There is clearly a strong connection with both of them--one romantic, the other friendly--but all of that is about to change when Eva learns a not-so-surprising piece of information.As previously stated, Enough Said's biggest failure isn't in its story, but in its predictability. I despise films that allow me to predict the outcome within the first 15-20 minutes because it no longer becomes an escape. At that point, it becomes a routine, something I have done over-and-over again, and it is no longer fun for me. It is obvious to everyone but Eva what is going on, and she takes an embarrassingly long time to figure it out herself. Her density is disturbing, and it becomes hard to root for her once you realize just how detached she is from her surroundings.One of the film's greatest accomplishments, however, comes from the dialogue and how the characters interact with one another. The conversations that are had throughout the film are very rich and relatable, and the same can be said about some of the situations these characters find themselves in. The awkward first date, the daughter's friend who would rather be at your house than her own, a friend of yours who never stops rearranging her house. The characters and their peers feel very real, which allows you to really connect with them despite knowing how their story will end.Furthermore, Enough Said is just extremely fun to watch. It is very laid back, and it never takes itself too seriously even though it touches on a lot of relatable topics. There is the constant sense of lightheartedness that makes it extremely difficult to hate even when I found it frustratingly simple. Gandolfini and Keener are brilliant in their roles, and it was nice to watch James give a performance that felt more grounded and accessible. What surprised me the most, however, was the emotion he was able to portray during the film's final act when the foundation of Eva's life completely collapsed. It was a surprising performance from an actor who had one final trick up his sleeve.Unfortunately, aside from the predictability, the thing that really kept Enough Said cemented in &#34;okay&#34; territory was the lack of chemistry between Louis-Dreyfus and Gandolfini. The awkwardness was cute for the first date because that weird tension is always going to be there, but it soon became clear that they were just awkward together. They didn't really compliment each other in any way, and even though Louis-Dreyfus didn't give a terrible performance, I almost hated seeing her on screen with Gandolfini. Everyone looks at certain couples and thinks &#34;They don't go together,&#34; and this was one of those couples for me.Overall Score: 7.2/10 - I was really excited to see this going in, and I was unaware that it received such high praise until after I watched it, but Enough Said fails to create something substantial. The extreme predictability and the lack of chemistry between the two leads stop this film from being a great romantic comedy, but that doesn't necessarily make it a bad one. There are some genuinely sweet moments, the characters feel authentic and real, and Gandolfini gave a surprisingly deep performance. These reasons alone should be enough to warrant a viewing. Just don't go in expecting to be moved by what you see.",4,"7.2/10 - Sweet, but insanely predictable",1397520000,"04 15, 2014",2014,4465,"['Note', 'May', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'Proceed', 'caution.If', 'had', 'told', 'year', 'one', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'final', 'roles', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'believed', 'was', 'Tony', 'Soprano', 'sure', 'enough', 'here', 'are', 'year', 'later', 'Gandolfini', 'done', 'exactly', 'Unfortunately', 'whole', 'Enough', 'Said', 'impress', 'elicit', 'strong', 'emotions', 'lead', 'characters', 'opinion', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'less', 'do', 'quality', 'film', 'more', 'do', 'fact', 'late', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'not', 'say', 'film', 'terrible', 'excruciatingly', 'predictable', 'huge', 'negative', 'me.Meet', 'Eva', 'Julia', 'Louis-Dreyfus', 'divorced', 'mother', 'daughter', 'who', 'start', 'college', 'attending', 'party', 'friends', 'Eva', 'Marianne', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'famous', 'poet', 'Albert', 'Gandolfini', 'share', 'strong', 'negative', 'opinions', 'ex-partners', 'decide', 'start', 'relationship', 'Eva', 'Eva', 'masseuse', 'giving', 'massages', 'Marianne', 'same', 'time', 'dating', 'Albert', 'clearly', 'strong', 'connection', 'one', 'romantic', 'other', 'friendly', 'change', 'when', 'Eva', 'not-so-surprising', 'piece', 'information.As', 'previously', 'stated', 'Enough', 'Said', 'biggest', 'failure', ""n't"", 'story', 'predictability', 'despise', 'films', 'allow', 'predict', 'outcome', 'first', '15-20', 'minutes', 'no', 'longer', 'escape', 'point', 'routine', 'something', 'have', 'done', 'over-and-over', 'again', 'no', 'longer', 'fun', 'obvious', 'everyone', 'Eva', 'what', 'going', 'embarrassingly', 'long', 'time', 'figure', 'out', 'density', 'disturbing', 'hard', 'root', 'once', 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'detached', 'surroundings.One', 'film', 'greatest', 'accomplishments', 'however', 'dialogue', 'how', 'characters', 'interact', 'one', 'conversations', 'are', 'had', 'film', 'are', 'very', 'rich', 'relatable', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'situations', 'characters', 'find', 'awkward', 'first', 'date', 'daughter', 'friend', 'who', 'would', 'rather', 'be', 'house', 'own', 'friend', 'yours', 'who', 'never', 'rearranging', 'house', 'characters', 'peers', 'feel', 'very', 'real', 'really', 'connect', 'knowing', 'how', 'story', 'will', 'end.Furthermore', 'Enough', 'Said', 'just', 'extremely', 'fun', 'watch', 'very', 'laid', 'back', 'never', 'too', 'seriously', 'even', 'lot', 'relatable', 'topics', 'constant', 'sense', 'lightheartedness', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'hate', 'even', 'when', 'found', 'frustratingly', 'simple', 'Gandolfini', 'Keener', 'are', 'brilliant', 'roles', 'was', 'nice', 'watch', 'James', 'give', 'performance', 'felt', 'more', 'grounded', 'accessible', 'What', 'surprised', 'most', 'however', 'was', 'emotion', 'was', 'able', 'portray', 'film', 'final', 'act', 'when', 'foundation', 'Eva', 'life', 'completely', 'collapsed', 'was', 'surprising', 'performance', 'actor', 'who', 'had', 'one', 'final', 'trick', 'up', 'sleeve.Unfortunately', 'aside', 'predictability', 'thing', 'really', 'kept', 'Enough', 'Said', 'cemented', '34', '34', 'territory', 'was', 'lack', 'chemistry', 'Louis-Dreyfus', 'Gandolfini', 'awkwardness', 'was', 'cute', 'first', 'date', 'weird', 'tension', 'always', 'going', 'be', 'there', 'soon', 'became', 'clear', 'were', 'just', 'awkward', 'together', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'compliment', 'other', 'way', 'even', 'Louis-Dreyfus', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'terrible', 'performance', 'almost', 'hated', 'seeing', 'screen', 'Gandolfini', 'Everyone', 'certain', 'couples', '34', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'together', '34', 'was', 'one', 'couples', 'me.Overall', 'Score', '7.2/10', 'was', 'really', 'excited', 'see', 'going', 'was', 'unaware', 'received', 'such', 'high', 'praise', 'watched', 'Enough', 'Said', 'create', 'something', 'substantial', 'extreme', 'predictability', 'lack', 'chemistry', 'two', 'leads', 'stop', 'film', 'being', 'great', 'romantic', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'make', 'bad', 'one', 'are', 'genuinely', 'sweet', 'moments', 'characters', 'feel', 'authentic', 'real', 'Gandolfini', 'gave', 'surprisingly', 'deep', 'performance', 'reasons', 'alone', 'should', 'be', 'enough', 'warrant', 'viewing', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'expecting', 'be', 'moved', 'what', 'see']",N/A

I believe it is okay for her to be friends with two individuals who are divorced from one another, but the point seems to be that neither one of them as forgiven or forgotten hurt feelings, so the masseuse has to pay for that.  She deserves a much bigger tip, like love instead of grunting because needs have to be met.  Move on, lady!  Her new best friend and her new lover were once married, so they reject her.

1673996,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00FZ4KR4U,M. Oleson,"[135, 152]","Nicole Holofcener has directed a handful of movies that few people have seen.  They have fallen into a category of ""women's movies"" that most men steer clear of lest they become gay or something.  I've seen them all (""Lovely & Amazing"" is my favorite) and I'm still straight.  And while her movies are far from terrible they are not terribly memorable either.  ""Enough Said"" is her best feature yet and yes, it's OK for a man too.A large part of the attraction is the late James Gandolfini who plays Albert, a bit of a slob, but funny and adorable.  Albert is divorced from Marianne (Holofcener regular Catherine Keener).  Together they have a daughter heading for college.  Although Albert is a key character in the storyline, his counterpart, Eva (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) has multiple relationships to deal with.  If you've watched Louis-Dreyfus over the years, you should be able to appreciate her dead-pan humor, much of which is displayed all over her face.  That talent comes across equally well on the big screen.Like Albert, Eva is divorced and has a daughter headed off to college.  When Eva and Albert meet for the first time at a party, the chemistry between them is evident right off the bat.  Holofcener, who also wrote the movie, is equally generous with some great lines that each actor delivers almost offhandedly.  They're both great.  Their lives get complicated as Eva had given her business card to Marianne at the same party.  She's a massage therapist and gets a call from Marianne.  They become friends but Eva is initially unaware that Albert, who she is now seeing regularly, is Marianne's ex.  As Marianne continually complains about her ex, Eva finally realizes the conflict.  But rather than announce it, or break off one of the relationships, she goes with it (it's a movie, not real life).  It's just a matter of time when the deception is unveiled and of course everyone is hurt.While the ending can be predicted, the banter between the characters is terrific.  Toni Collette and Ben Falcone play Eva's married best friends and they get in some funny zingers as well.

1674013,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00FZ4KR4U,Paul Allaer,"[145, 168]","""Enough Said"" (2013 release; 93 min.) brings the story of Eva (played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus), a middle-aged divorcee whose daughter is about to go off the college across the country. As the movie opens, we see Eva make house calls to her clients to provide massages. One evening, Eva tags along with her friends to a party, and there gets introduced to several people, including Albert (played by James Gandolfini), also a middle-aged and divorced (we later learn that his daughter is also about to go off to college). Eva also gets introduced to Marianne (played by Catherine Keener), a well-known poet who is lonely and hires Eva to give her massages (and bend her ear about her lousy ex). Eva and Albert go on a first date, and things are going surprisingly well. Meanwhile Eva is dealing with her daughter's pending departure. At this point we are about 30 min. into the movie, and to tell you more of the plot would surely ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: first, this movie is a tour-de-force of writer-director Nicole Holofcener, best known for her 2006 movie ""Friends With Money"". Holofcener brings us an outstanding slice of life that really resonated with me (like the main characters, I am middle-aged and divorced, and have gone through the sending off kids to college phase as well). This is not some Hollywood phantasy: instead we get to know (and like) believable characters. Second, the acting performances are nothing short of top-notch. Let's start with Julia Louis-Dreyfus: while there are some laugh-inducing scenes in the movie (as some point she refers to someone as a ""human TripAdvisor"", ha!), this is mostly a relationship drama, and we get to see Louis-Dreyfus in a dramatic role, which she rarely gets to play. It just makes you wish that she would take on big-screen roles more often (she has done some voice-characters for kids movies, but has rarely, if ever, been in a lead role). Then there is James Gandolfini, in his last major role before his shocking and untimely death earlier this year. Best known for his role in The Sopranos, he plays the big cuddly teddy-bear type guy, and you just can't help but shake your head at his premature departure. It what makes this movie such a bitter-sweet experience. There are a bunch of smaller roles that are equally outstanding, none more so than Catherine Keener (who has appeared in all of Holofcener's movies). Last but not least, there is a wonderful soundtrack, mostly with indie music from artists like the Eels, Neil Halstead, Mideau and others.This movie has been playing on 2 screens (which is highly unusual) at my local art-house here in Cincinnati for several weeks now, and yet when I went to see recently, it was still packing them in. The screening I saw this at was very well attended indeed, which is GREAT news, as this is a movie that just deserves to be seen. If you are in the mood for a top-notch indie movie that dissects relationships with an honesty and veracity not seen very often, you cannot go wrong with this.

We have seen the tough guys, but now he brings the romantic guy with so much going for him. Julia Louis-Dreyfus has accolades coming her way for her character in VEEP, and now she brings this wonderful character to the screen. I cannot say enough good things about these actors and this film.Nicole Holofcener is the director of 'Enough Said', and she brought home two of the finest performances I have seen this year. A glance, a twitch of the eyebrow, and we know what the character is thinking. This is a funny romantic film,with laugh out loud laughs. Julia Louis-Dreyfus and the late James Gandolfini, are in a word, Magnifique!Albert, Gandolfini and Eva, Louis-Dreyfus are both divorced parents of teens getting ready for college. Eva is a masseuse and goes from home to home to meet her clients. It is a tough job, listening to these people tell her their problems, but she does OK. Albert works in a Film History Museum. They meet at a party, each one says they have not met anyone that attracts them, but, of course, the more they talk, the more they like. They date, and everything seems fine until it isn't. Both parents dread having their girls leave. Both girls are anxious, but OK about leaving.Albert and Eva's relationship becomes public knowledge and friends meet them. .Eva has some interesting pals, Sarah played by Toni Collette and Marianne, played by Catherine Keener, who for various reasons have their own problems. Mistakes are made, and things happen, not for the better. The times and places to get to the heart of the matter, is the film itself. The relationships that shatter seem not to be repairable.What carries this film are the characters and the two we are talking about, Albert and Eva. This is a film that goes from humour to tears in a split second, and that happens because of these characters, their feelings and emotions are on their sleeves. There is a great deal that goes on in this film , and I bid you see it.Highly Recommended. prisrob 01-14-14",5,Magnificent,1389657600,"01 14, 2014",2014,2137,"['was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'know', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'died', 'young', 'age', 'watching', 'film', 'home', 'what', 'marvelous', 'actor', 'was', 'have', 'seen', 'tough', 'guys', 'now', 'romantic', 'guy', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'Julia', 'Louis-Dreyfus', 'accolades', 'coming', 'way', 'character', 'VEEP', 'now', 'wonderful', 'character', 'screen', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'enough', 'good', 'things', 'actors', 'film.Nicole', 'Holofcener', 'director', ""'Enough"", 'Said', 'brought', 'home', 'two', 'finest', 'performances', 'have', 'seen', 'year', 'glance', 'twitch', 'eyebrow', 'know', 'what', 'character', 'thinking', 'funny', 'romantic', 'film', 'laugh', 'loud', 'laughs', 'Julia', 'Louis-Dreyfus', 'late', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'are', 'word', 'Magnifique', 'Albert', 'Gandolfini', 'Eva', 'Louis-Dreyfus', 'are', 'divorced', 'parents', 'teens', 'getting', 'ready', 'college', 'Eva', 'masseuse', 'home', 'home', 'meet', 'clients', 'tough', 'job', 'listening', 'people', 'tell', 'problems', 'OK.', 'Albert', 'Film', 'History', 'Museum', 'meet', 'party', 'one', 'have', 'not', 'met', 'anyone', 'course', 'more', 'talk', 'more', 'like', 'date', 'everything', 'fine', ""n't"", 'parents', 'dread', 'having', 'girls', 'leave', 'girls', 'are', 'anxious', 'OK', 'leaving.Albert', 'Eva', 'relationship', 'public', 'knowledge', 'friends', 'meet', '.Eva', 'interesting', 'pals', 'Sarah', 'played', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'Marianne', 'played', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'who', 'various', 'reasons', 'have', 'own', 'problems', 'Mistakes', 'are', 'made', 'things', 'happen', 'not', 'better', 'times', 'places', 'get', 'heart', 'matter', 'film', 'relationships', 'shatter', 'seem', 'not', 'be', 'repairable.What', 'film', 'are', 'characters', 'two', 'are', 'talking', 'Albert', 'Eva', 'film', 'humour', 'tears', 'split', 'second', 'characters', 'feelings', 'emotions', 'are', 'sleeves', 'great', 'deal', 'film', 'bid', 'see', 'it.Highly', 'Recommended', 'prisrob', '01-14-14']",N/A

This is perhaps the most realistic portrayal of life and love that I have seen on the screen in a very long time.  The main characters Eva -- a masseuse and Albert -- a Museum Curator have survived first marriages.  He was married to a shallow, self-absorbed woman who bought into the perpetual dieting, exercise, and pretense that characterizes much of Society today.  Eva's marriage just didn't work out.  When asked she couldn't really say why she got a divorce other than ""we just didn't seem to fit"".  But the film really offered some great insight into what marriage and love is all about.  I think those people who have been married a long time will probably get and understand this film a lot better than young unmarried or recently married people.  What we see with Eva and Albert are two people not sure they want to get involved again but they find they sort of like each other.  As their relationship grows they find that a little tolerance, a little understanding, and a little forgiveness provides for a more stable relationship and a lot more fun.  Albert is overweight and doesn't really care, he isn't the most handsome guy, but he is comfortable being himself.  Eva seems uncertain who she is or what she wants out of life but finds herself drawn to the down to earth life style of Albert. Both are older and wiser and it shows.Albert and Eva are real people. People with a sense of humor, with ordinary problems, and low expectations.  My favorite scene was the final one where they sat together on the front steps as they made up over their serious quarrel.  She nudges him and they both just get a chuckle out of their quarrel as their good humor reasserts itself and they are reconciled.  Having been married for a very long time I have lived that scene many times.  I left the theater warm and comfortable in my own marriage.

1674050,AWUUMER0F3WF4,B00FZ4KR4U,Sheryl Fechter,"[2, 2]","Writer and director, Nicole Holofcener, brings us a comfortably sweet and curious story with just enough quirkiness and a couple of real sharp lefts to keep us very interested in these characters.  Just when the waters are nice and smooth, something comes along and rocks the boat again.  This is one of those types of movies that I love when I take time to stop and smell the roses, and they are generously provided here.  I have been waiting to see ""Enough Said"", especially because it is James Gandolfini's last picture, and he is all personality here as Albert to Julia Louis-Dreyfus', Eva. He adds such a terrific ease and uncomplicated charm to his portrayal and has us longing for the people that demonstrate this in our own lives.  Hence the 'comfortably sweet' comment.  He makes this look like this is how he lives his life every day, not acts in a film.  The 'curious' description is all wrapped-up in the way the story looks at forgiveness. A task we are challenged by all of the time.Best friend, Sarah (Toni Collette), wishes that Eva would accompany her and husband, Will (Ben Falcone), to a party so Eva agrees, reluctantly.  She just cannot find or meet a man that is interesting enough to share a meal, let alone a real engaging conversation with.  Even friends or people with something to say are becoming sparse.  This is making Eva not want to put herself out there much anymore. Being a masseuse she is able to meet people and has her regular clients, although this is work related, not social.  For Eva now, it all feels like a dying art form to meet a reasonably informed person and share a conversation as she sinks further into the doldrums.On this night, though, fortune smiles brightly at her, and she meets an interesting woman, Marianne (Catherine Keener), who works as a poet and wants to hire her for regular massage therapy. She then meets a man, Albert (James Gandolfini), who intrigues her so much with his vague interest, or is he kind of shy?  Maybe coy?  She has just told Will that she cannot find anyone at the party that is anywhere near attractive, then here is Albert.  Albert professes the same thing back to Eva as they start a friendly banter.  Their chemistry is quite easy to see right from the start.  They each have a daughter on the verge of heading off to college and neither are ready to see them go.  Albert says of his daughter's (Tess) relationship towards him as, ""It's all I have"".  Eva laughs agreeably about her daughter (Ellen), although truthfully these two are in the same boat.  Neither one of them wants their daughter to go away nor be away from them.  They also make some plans to see each other again.  I surmise that they each found someone attractive at the party after all.Marianne calls Eva quickly for a massage, and they begin their work together.  They also strike up quite a chatty friendship and talk all about their lives, daughters, and ex-husbands openly.  Just about everything is on the table for discussion as their relationship only grows with time.  Of Marianne's home, Eva thinks it is so lovely and beautifully decorated that she asks, ""can I live here?"".  Marianne lives among the finer things, likes the details in her life now, and gives the appearance of being just a little above it all when talking about her horrible ex-husband.  She is very detailed with all of the negative things about him and how much he really was wrong for her.  Eva listens intently to her new and informative client, sharing her own experiences, and finally cultivating a friendship that is great to be involved in for a change.Eva and Albert do go out for that dinner right away, and we can see those sparks flying as they exchange barbs in the most comical manner.  There is a lot of laughter at this dinner table.  They each have a sense of humor that makes for a great pair and it is easy to see that these two have a lot of fun.  Eva and Albert do some off-the-wall things together, they get downright silly, like looking at each other's teeth and other things that people do when they are so comfortable together.  The two have so much in common and are excited to learn about one another.  I really enjoy movies that allow the couple to be more free and uninhibited, like this lovely movie.  So much of a relationship can be in the things that go overlooked which indeed shouldn't be.As I wrote at the beginning, the movie takes a couple of really sharp lefts, some twists, some turns, that is what is going to start happening.  Some already have started and the movie is probably around 30 minutes in.  I couldn't go on with this description as I would spoil this for anyone considering this endearing film. I loved this character driven and dialog based story.  Eva and Albert have a sincere and quirky chemistry together and I absolutely enjoyed seeing them as a couple; hopefully this will be what shines for you too.*For those who are sentimental such as me, watch through the end credits for the very short dedication - it will definitely bring a tear to your eye.",5,"""I Kind Of Adore You"" - Albert",1394755200,"03 14, 2014",2014,5046,"['Writer', 'director', 'Nicole', 'Holofcener', 'comfortably', 'sweet', 'curious', 'story', 'just', 'enough', 'quirkiness', 'couple', 'real', 'sharp', 'lefts', 'keep', 'very', 'interested', 'characters', 'Just', 'when', 'waters', 'are', 'nice', 'smooth', 'something', 'along', 'boat', 'again', 'one', 'types', 'movies', 'love', 'when', 'take', 'time', 'stop', 'smell', 'roses', 'are', 'generously', 'provided', 'here', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'see', 'Enough', 'Said', 'especially', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'last', 'picture', 'personality', 'here', 'Albert', 'Julia', 'Louis-Dreyfus', 'Eva', 'terrific', 'ease', 'uncomplicated', 'charm', 'portrayal', 'longing', 'people', 'demonstrate', 'own', 'lives', 'Hence', ""'comfortably"", 'sweet', 'comment', 'look', 'how', 'life', 'day', 'not', 'film', ""'curious"", 'description', 'wrapped-up', 'way', 'story', 'forgiveness', 'task', 'are', 'challenged', 'time.Best', 'friend', 'Sarah', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'Eva', 'would', 'accompany', 'husband', 'Will', 'Ben', 'Falcone', 'party', 'so', 'Eva', 'reluctantly', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'meet', 'man', 'interesting', 'enough', 'share', 'meal', 'let', 'alone', 'real', 'engaging', 'conversation', 'Even', 'people', 'something', 'say', 'are', 'becoming', 'sparse', 'making', 'Eva', 'not', 'want', 'put', 'there', 'much', 'anymore', 'Being', 'masseuse', 'able', 'meet', 'people', 'regular', 'clients', 'work', 'related', 'not', 'social', 'Eva', 'now', 'feels', 'dying', 'art', 'form', 'meet', 'reasonably', 'informed', 'person', 'share', 'conversation', 'further', 'doldrums.On', 'night', 'though', 'fortune', 'smiles', 'brightly', 'interesting', 'woman', 'Marianne', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'who', 'poet', 'hire', 'regular', 'massage', 'therapy', 'then', 'man', 'Albert', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'who', 'so', 'much', 'vague', 'interest', 'kind', 'shy', 'Maybe', 'coy', 'just', 'told', 'Will', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'anyone', 'party', 'anywhere', 'near', 'attractive', 'then', 'here', 'Albert', 'Albert', 'same', 'thing', 'back', 'Eva', 'start', 'friendly', 'banter', 'chemistry', 'quite', 'easy', 'see', 'right', 'start', 'have', 'daughter', 'verge', 'heading', 'off', 'college', 'are', 'ready', 'see', 'go', 'Albert', 'daughter', 'Tess', 'relationship', 'have', 'Eva', 'agreeably', 'daughter', 'Ellen', 'truthfully', 'two', 'are', 'same', 'boat', 'one', 'daughter', 'go', 'away', 'be', 'away', 'also', 'make', 'plans', 'see', 'other', 'again', 'surmise', 'found', 'someone', 'attractive', 'party', 'all.Marianne', 'calls', 'Eva', 'quickly', 'massage', 'begin', 'work', 'together', 'also', 'strike', 'up', 'quite', 'chatty', 'friendship', 'talk', 'lives', 'daughters', 'ex-husbands', 'openly', 'Just', 'everything', 'table', 'discussion', 'relationship', 'only', 'time', 'Marianne', 'home', 'Eva', 'so', 'lovely', 'beautifully', 'decorated', 'can', 'live', 'here', 'Marianne', 'finer', 'things', 'details', 'life', 'now', 'appearance', 'being', 'just', 'little', 'when', 'talking', 'horrible', 'ex-husband', 'very', 'detailed', 'negative', 'things', 'how', 'much', 'really', 'was', 'wrong', 'Eva', 'intently', 'new', 'informative', 'client', 'sharing', 'own', 'experiences', 'finally', 'cultivating', 'friendship', 'great', 'be', 'involved', 'change.Eva', 'Albert', 'do', 'go', 'out', 'dinner', 'right', 'away', 'can', 'see', 'sparks', 'flying', 'exchange', 'barbs', 'most', 'comical', 'manner', 'lot', 'laughter', 'dinner', 'table', 'have', 'sense', 'humor', 'great', 'pair', 'easy', 'see', 'two', 'have', 'lot', 'fun', 'Eva', 'Albert', 'do', 'off-the-wall', 'things', 'together', 'get', 'downright', 'silly', 'looking', 'other', 'teeth', 'other', 'things', 'people', 'do', 'when', 'are', 'so', 'comfortable', 'together', 'two', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'common', 'are', 'excited', 'learn', 'one', 'really', 'enjoy', 'movies', 'allow', 'couple', 'be', 'more', 'free', 'uninhibited', 'lovely', 'movie', 'So', 'much', 'relationship', 'can', 'be', 'things', 'go', 'overlooked', 'indeed', 'should', ""n't"", 'be.As', 'wrote', 'beginning', 'movie', 'couple', 'really', 'sharp', 'lefts', 'twists', 'turns', 'what', 'going', 'start', 'happening', 'already', 'have', 'started', 'movie', 'probably', '30', 'minutes', 'could', ""n't"", 'go', 'description', 'would', 'spoil', 'anyone', 'considering', 'endearing', 'film', 'loved', 'character', 'driven', 'dialog', 'based', 'story', 'Eva', 'Albert', 'have', 'sincere', 'quirky', 'chemistry', 'together', 'absolutely', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'couple', 'hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'what', 'too', 'who', 'are', 'sentimental', 'such', 'watch', 'end', 'credits', 'very', 'short', 'dedication', 'will', 'definitely', 'bring', 'tear', 'eye']",N/A

1674053,AMNNPDX9MFEUD,B00FZ4KR4U,Steve,"[0, 0]","Enough Said was a sweet and charming little movie full of believable characters played to perfection by two great actors. I thought Gandolfini's understated and quiet turn was a nice change of pace, and Louis-Dreyfus' conflicted, flawed, and blundering role was brilliant done. She has a face that portrays so much and she uses this gift to convey the uncertainty, remorse, and emotional ups and downs of Eva, the masseuse who plays the love interest to Gandolfini's Albert. Both actors handle this dialogue-driven, bittersweet dramedy with nuance and precision. Emotions are subdued and genuine, the word ""love"" is never mentioned, and the audience is treated with maturity and respect.There aren't enough smart adult takes on relationships and their fragile nature, especially for those of us who have been through the horror of divorce and its endless ripples. It was refreshing to have two well-written characters negotiating the obstacles of post-divorce romance, wherein friends, children, career, and the lives we have built in the aftermath create a wall around our scarred hearts to buffer against further damage. Love, passion, and obsessive behaviors are best left to the young, and it's downright silly when older actors are made to act like lovesick fools. At one point, Albert calmly apologizes to Eva for admitting that his heart was broken, adding ""I'm getting too old for this..."" It's a perfect scene that sums up romance in the middle years. One of the most rewarding things about living long enough is coming to the realization that you've outgrown certain pursuits. There's a reason Romeo and Juliet were mere teens.This movie is intelligent and, save the unnecessary and clich&eacute;d introspection with melancholy song interlude near the end, refrains from the predictable rom-com traps. Eva and Albert behave like middle-aged adults instead of cornball Hollywood stereotypes. Instead of trying to sell massive numbers of tickets and appeal to a broad audience, the folks behind Enough Said kept their integrity and made a beautiful little story I felt deeply. I can't say that I recommend it to everyone, because some of you might be put off by the slow moving story and perhaps even by the mistakes some characters make.

Since the formats can be different, I always suggest that buyers sort reviews by  &#8220;Newest First&#8221; and then note which format the reviewer is discussing. With that said, this is my review of the Bluray release.I won&#8217;t spend much time on the film itself as there are already lots of opinions. The film was released by 20th Century Fox but under their Fox Searchlight umbrella so you know this is &#8220;character driven&#8221; and it is. Of course, it&#8217;s getting most exposure as being James Gandolfini&#8217;s last film and the actor plays a sympathetic character role.

Unfortunately, the reviews were wrong. Great performances by Dreyfus and Gandolfini are forced to cohabitate with a terrible, mundane plot. This makes it impossible to feel sympathy for the characters or their lives. It seems as if the characters are purposely depicted in a way as to evoke pity. This is enraging because these characters are not pathetic in the least. I tried really really hard to empathize with the them, but it was impossible. They are just not realistic and therefore impossible to care about.Julia Louis Dreyfus&#8217; uninteresting character egomaniacally brings on all her own misfortunes. We see her make bad choice after bad choice. It is no wonder that she ruins all her personal relationships. She's an idiot! But Dreyfus&#8217; acting is fantastic. What a paradox!The most enraging thing is that this film was advertised as a humorous drama. I left the theater post-film, fuming at being misled. I felt I&#8217;d had been taken like a sucker into thinking this was some kind of quirky little indie film, something Squid and the Whale-ish (even though I don't like Squid, I like that genre). I would have accepted the film more openly had it at least been a romantic comedy, but Enough Said is a full-on romance. It has some hilarious parts, but they are single handedly the result of Dreyfus&#8217; spectacular performance.This film snubs us unlucky people by declaring that it is in fact our own fault that are we live screwed up lives. But we unlucky people don't want to be told it's our fault. We like to blame the world for our problems, and we like to see charters on the screen that fall from grace not because they fly to close to the sun, but because the sun explodes and engulfs them in flames.I can name on one hand the romances stories I like, so perhaps by not being part of this film's target audiences I am negatively biased.

They could not save this depressing movie about loneliness and boredom. This is an interesting movie about damaged relationships with a few laughs but it's not a good movie. The character played by Julia Dreyfus (Eva) elicits pity and sympathy and Catherine Keener's character is Eva's newly formed best friend (Marianne). They awkwardly share many friendly moments until Julia's character (Eva) discovers that she is dating her new best friend's ex-husband Albert (Gandolfini). Albert is morbidly obese, oafish, stubborn, and dull which left me wondering why Eva was so interested in him. The make-out and sex scenes with Julia Dreyfus and James Gandolfini are awkward and uncomfortable to watch. The dating scenes between them are also awkward and annoying: Albert teases Eva passive aggressively during dates; however, later in the film Albert is hyper-sensitive to any teasing or feedback which later breaks up the relationship. Eva's other friends are equally self-absorbed, bitter, and immature. A few times they even gang up against Eva to spoil her occasional happy and thoughtful moods. Every character is lonely, lost, bored, self absorbed, and slightly narcissistic and each of the characters go through small hardships and growing pains throughout the movie. At the end of the movie they have each other which left me feeling that very little had been resolved between the characters. Eva develops an odd fixation with Albert and attempts several times to rekindle the romance. She seemed like a very lonely woman who had to settle for less which left me feeling sad for her.

It was nice seeing him in a role where he played a character that was the opposite of Tony Soprano, the part he'll always be known for. Here he's a self-effacing, low key, 'good guy', probably close in temperament to the way friends and family have described him in real life.The film's inciting incident occurs when Eva, a divorced masseuse with a teenage daughter, is introduced to Gandolfini's character, Albert, at a party in an affluent section of Los Angeles. Eva also meets Marianne, a successful poet, at the party and she takes her on as one of her massage clients.The film proceeds slowly as Albert courts Eva. Despite his girth, Albert manages to charm Eva who confesses that she usually isn't attracted to large men but is gradually won over by his sense of humor.The break into Act II, occurs when Eva discovers that her new massage client (and newly found friend) is Albert's ex-wife. The main weakness of the plot hinges on Eva's decision not to tell Marianne that she's going out with Albert. The explanation given is that Eva somehow also likes Marianne and doesn't want to upset her. This, of course, is at the expense of her relationship with Albert.It's hard to believe that Eva, due to her poor choice, didn't anticipate that she would end up in such an awkward position like trying to hide in the bushes, to avoid making contact with Marianne's daughter, who she had met earlier as well as that even more awkward moment when Albert finds her at Marianne's house.The bulk of 'Enough Said' hinges on Eva's bad decision and one keeps wondering why she simply couldn't have been honest with Marianne from the get go. But of course if that's the case, there would have been no movie.As a character, Marianne is unlikeable and one-note, with her constant put-downs of her ex-husband. But she also serves the purpose of putting doubts in Eva's mind as to whether Albert is truly a good catch. Most of the complaints do seem trivial, including Albert's penchant for separating the onions in the guacamole and his inability to clean up after himself. But his rigid insistence that he does whisper (when he clearly doesn't), is a point, which, if I were Eva, would not overlook.Nonetheless, as things play out, Eva does realize the error of her ways, leading to the heart felt reconciliation at the film's climax.'Enough Said' also has a number of sub-plots best described as only slightly amusing. One involves Eva's daughter's friend, who enjoys spending quality time with Eva, much to the chagrin of her own mother.Julia Louis-Dreyfus is most enjoyable when she plays off of Gandolfini's self-deprecating humor. The banter between the two is what makes 'Enough Said' so engaging. Nonetheless, Eva's failure to come clean at the onset, resulting in the plot's complications, is not something I believe most people would have chosen to do in real life.",3,Gandolfini's final performance saves film with major plot contrivance,1390867200,"01 28, 2014",2014,3019,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***There', 'one', 'very', 'good', 'reason', 'see', ""'Enough"", 'Said', 'course', 'late', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'performance', 'was', 'nice', 'seeing', 'role', 'where', 'played', 'character', 'was', 'opposite', 'Tony', 'Soprano', 'part', ""'ll"", 'always', 'be', 'known', 'Here', 'self-effacing', 'low', 'key', 'guy', 'probably', 'close', 'temperament', 'way', 'friends', 'family', 'have', 'described', 'real', 'life.The', 'film', 'inciting', 'incident', 'when', 'Eva', 'divorced', 'masseuse', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'introduced', 'Gandolfini', 'character', 'Albert', 'party', 'affluent', 'section', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Eva', 'also', 'Marianne', 'successful', 'poet', 'party', 'one', 'massage', 'clients.The', 'film', 'proceeds', 'slowly', 'Albert', 'courts', 'Eva', 'girth', 'Albert', 'charm', 'Eva', 'who', 'usually', ""n't"", 'attracted', 'large', 'men', 'gradually', 'won', 'over', 'sense', 'humor.The', 'break', 'Act', 'II', 'when', 'Eva', 'new', 'massage', 'client', 'newly', 'found', 'friend', 'Albert', 'ex-wife', 'main', 'weakness', 'plot', 'hinges', 'Eva', 'decision', 'not', 'tell', 'Marianne', 'going', 'out', 'Albert', 'explanation', 'given', 'Eva', 'somehow', 'also', 'Marianne', ""n't"", 'want', 'upset', 'course', 'expense', 'relationship', 'Albert.It', 'hard', 'believe', 'Eva', 'due', 'poor', 'choice', 'did', ""n't"", 'anticipate', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'such', 'awkward', 'position', 'trying', 'hide', 'bushes', 'avoid', 'making', 'contact', 'Marianne', 'daughter', 'who', 'had', 'met', 'earlier', 'as', 'well', 'even', 'more', 'awkward', 'moment', 'when', 'Albert', 'Marianne', 'house.The', 'bulk', ""'Enough"", 'Said', 'hinges', 'Eva', 'bad', 'decision', 'one', 'keeps', 'wondering', 'why', 'simply', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'honest', 'Marianne', 'get', 'go', 'course', 'case', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'movie.As', 'character', 'Marianne', 'unlikeable', 'one-note', 'constant', 'put-downs', 'ex-husband', 'also', 'purpose', 'putting', 'doubts', 'Eva', 'mind', 'Albert', 'truly', 'good', 'catch', 'Most', 'complaints', 'do', 'seem', 'trivial', 'including', 'Albert', 'penchant', 'separating', 'onions', 'guacamole', 'inability', 'clean', 'up', 'rigid', 'insistence', 'whisper', 'when', 'clearly', ""n't"", 'point', 'were', 'Eva', 'would', 'not', 'overlook.Nonetheless', 'things', 'play', 'out', 'Eva', 'realize', 'error', 'ways', 'leading', 'heart', 'felt', 'reconciliation', 'film', 'climax', 'Said', 'also', 'number', 'sub-plots', 'best', 'described', 'only', 'slightly', 'amusing', 'One', 'Eva', 'daughter', 'friend', 'who', 'spending', 'quality', 'time', 'Eva', 'much', 'chagrin', 'own', 'mother.Julia', 'Louis-Dreyfus', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'when', 'Gandolfini', 'self-deprecating', 'humor', 'banter', 'two', 'what', ""'Enough"", 'Said', 'so', 'engaging', 'Nonetheless', 'Eva', 'failure', 'come', 'clean', 'onset', 'resulting', 'plot', 'complications', 'not', 'something', 'believe', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'have', 'chosen', 'do', 'real', 'life']",N/A

So when my girlfriend said she was in the mood for a comedy, we stumbled upon Enough Said.This ain't no comedy.The main theme of this movie is awkward, really awkward. The characters are awkward, the dialogue is awkward, the situation is awkward, everything is damn awkward.And you know what? It never gets better. Sure the flimsy plot gets resolved and there's some sort of character progression. But it's just not really that funny.It's a movie about being middle aged, relationship problems, being in a divorce, having kids that are all grown up, and dating. Does this sound like a comedy to you? I don't think so, no, no, no.It's a romance movie trying to disguise itself as a comedy. There are no outlandish funny moments, just some quips of dialogue that may make you chuckle. But ya ain't gonna find funny here.The sub plots made no sense, the characters aren't really that likeable, and there's no real pay off in the ending.
