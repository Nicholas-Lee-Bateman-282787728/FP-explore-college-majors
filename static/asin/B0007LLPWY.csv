882200,ABWHLZFEM5SZY,B0007LLPWY,R. Jensen,"[0, 0]","These two movies are both nice movies for kids. The first one is a classic and definutly superior, but they are both a lot of fun in their own ways. What mainly sets them apart is the contrast of main plot lines. The first is about kids playing baseball and accidently finding themselves in a local myth, while the second is more about relationship between players and the time period the film takes place in, with another myth thrown in randomly. They both also have a few basic life lessons and some fun humor to entertain slightly older viewers.For those you have seen the first and not the second, I should warn you that the third act is a lot like the first film. Hopefully like me, you'll enjoy the first two thirds to forgive that part somewhat. It's thanks to that, I had to drop a star from this combo packs score.Ultimatly Sandlot 5/5, Sandlot 2 3/5 but you should expereince it and find your own opinon.",4,Interesting contrast of movies,1394928000,"03 16, 2014",2014,914,"['two', 'movies', 'are', 'nice', 'movies', 'kids', 'first', 'one', 'classic', 'definutly', 'superior', 'are', 'lot', 'fun', 'own', 'ways', 'What', 'mainly', 'apart', 'contrast', 'main', 'plot', 'lines', 'first', 'kids', 'playing', 'baseball', 'accidently', 'finding', 'local', 'myth', 'second', 'more', 'relationship', 'players', 'time', 'period', 'film', 'place', 'myth', 'thrown', 'randomly', 'also', 'have', 'few', 'basic', 'life', 'lessons', 'fun', 'humor', 'entertain', 'slightly', 'older', 'viewers.For', 'have', 'seen', 'first', 'not', 'second', 'should', 'warn', 'third', 'act', 'lot', 'first', 'film', 'Hopefully', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'first', 'two', 'thirds', 'forgive', 'part', 'somewhat', 'thanks', 'had', 'drop', 'star', 'combo', 'score.Ultimatly', 'Sandlot', '5/5', 'Sandlot', '2', '3/5', 'should', 'expereince', 'find', 'own', 'opinon']",The Sandlot/The Sandlot 2
882201,A2DGIMEDQCMA2H,B0007LLPWY,"RockChic4Life ""BubbleGumGurl""","[11, 11]","When I was babysitting my cousins last year with my friend, they had The Sandlot with them and my friend and I had never watched it so we did when my cousins were sleeping and we fell in love with the movie and its characters, then in April of this year, we found out about the sequel and we rented it, which I must say is just about as good as the first one if not as good or better. The plot lines are a bit similar and a bit different, both have a kissing scene (First movie: Squints and Lifeguard, Second: Fingers and Kissing booth chick), and both have something lost over the fence where the dog is (First movie: baseball, Second: Rocket) and both have a Smalls, (First: Scotty Smalls, Second: His brother Johnny Smalls) and both have a character with a wise mouth (First: Ham, Second: Mac) but the Sandlot 2 has girls on their team, Hayley, Jenny, and Penny and they actually deal with a first love unlike in the first one when there was a crush on the lifeguard. Plus, the first one does deal more with baseball than the second one does...oh yeah, and both movies have insanely gorgeous guys (First: Benny, Second: David), but both movies are awesome.Both movies are really funny and enjoyable, I'm definitely buying this pack. And if you liked the first one, there is a pretty good chance you'll like the second one.My brother absolutley adored The Sandlot and refused to watch the sequel, but then he saw me and my friend watching it so he thought he would just give it a shot, and he liked it. So if you liked the first one, like I said, there's a good chance you'll like the sequel too.",5,Both movies rock,1117324800,"05 29, 2005",2005,1598,"['When', 'was', 'babysitting', 'cousins', 'last', 'year', 'friend', 'had', 'Sandlot', 'friend', 'had', 'never', 'watched', 'did', 'when', 'cousins', 'were', 'sleeping', 'fell', 'love', 'movie', 'characters', 'then', 'April', 'year', 'found', 'out', 'sequel', 'rented', 'must', 'say', 'just', 'about', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'one', 'not', 'good', 'better', 'plot', 'lines', 'are', 'bit', 'similar', 'bit', 'different', 'have', 'kissing', 'scene', 'First', 'movie', 'Squints', 'Lifeguard', 'Second', 'Fingers', 'Kissing', 'booth', 'chick', 'have', 'something', 'lost', 'fence', 'where', 'dog', 'First', 'movie', 'baseball', 'Second', 'Rocket', 'have', 'Smalls', 'First', 'Scotty', 'Smalls', 'Second', 'brother', 'Johnny', 'Smalls', 'have', 'character', 'wise', 'mouth', 'First', 'Ham', 'Second', 'Mac', 'Sandlot', '2', 'girls', 'team', 'Hayley', 'Jenny', 'Penny', 'actually', 'deal', 'first', 'love', 'first', 'one', 'when', 'was', 'crush', 'lifeguard', 'first', 'one', 'deal', 'more', 'baseball', 'second', 'one', 'yeah', 'movies', 'have', 'insanely', 'gorgeous', 'guys', 'First', 'Benny', 'Second', 'David', 'movies', 'are', 'awesome.Both', 'movies', 'are', 'really', 'funny', 'enjoyable', ""'m"", 'definitely', 'buying', 'pack', 'liked', 'first', 'one', 'pretty', 'good', 'chance', ""'ll"", 'like', 'second', 'one.My', 'brother', 'absolutley', 'adored', 'Sandlot', 'refused', 'watch', 'sequel', 'then', 'saw', 'friend', 'watching', 'thought', 'would', 'just', 'give', 'shot', 'liked', 'So', 'liked', 'first', 'one', 'said', 'good', 'chance', ""'ll"", 'like', 'sequel', 'too']",The Sandlot/The Sandlot 2

Part 2 is almost the same exact thing and the first. [see the movie and you will know what I mean.] I say just buy the original and don't even look at the second no matter what kind of fan you are or how tempted you may get. Might as well sell this movie and just copy it and put it in the set with a new cover, add some new characters and kiss the box before you ship it out.
