997883,A2NYR079RDGE7N,B000G0O5FK,"A. Parker ""book lady""","[4, 5]","It's pretty much a dance workout. You do the electric slide and other dances, but it's really creative too. The only thing I wasn't too keen on was that you don't have the option to watch the DVD all the way through. It's split up into sections. So, you have to stop after each section and hit play again. For example, the warmup is one section. The aerobic workout is another section. The cool down is another. This disrupted my workout a bit in all honesty. Plus, you will need a ""workout belt"" or something for some of the moves. I didn't have one, so I just used my weights. Made it a better workout anyway. Overall though, it's a great time. She's got lots of energy and super encouraging. She also quotes Scriptures all through the workout. Oh, one more down side though: the cool down could really use a lot of work. I honestly think that if you get this DVD, you should do your own cool down and stretch or do another DVD that has a good one. This DVD does not. Still, a great production though.

It was really irritating.I also didn't like the set too much - was really flashy, literally.  Not recommended for anyone who has problems with flashing lights, etc.  The walking segment wasn't really walking, it was just another lower impact routine, so that was a disappointment.  In the same section there is one song with hardly any beat to move to so it is very awkward.  I didn't care for the resistance band section because each segment was too short and didn't really jive well with the lower impact it was combined with.

But I took my time, and did not over rotate, my upper, nor lower half during the routines. I will say I forgot I was doing aerobics after about 2 minutes. I kept going, and going, and going. What a joyous, and upbeat workout. The place where the DVD was recorded was awesome. The atmosphere was like a party with the huge screen displaying the light show; behind the live band, and singers. I have begun to experience working out in a different way.I am a runner, however, since doing the line dancing, and aerobics, I get my heart rate up faster, and do less pounding my knees. This definitely will continue to be a large add on to my workouts.Love you Donna!!!UPDATE:9/4/2011....I have lost a bunch of inches; thus far. I don't bother to weigh, because I have lots of muscle anyhow. So inches count for me. The choice of workouts within the same dvd makes it so much easier to click, and move on to what you want; without having to stop, and put in another dvd to change your preference. You get 2 10 minute ""walking in the spirit"" workouts, which are energetic low impact, but effective. 2 10 minute line dancing programs, that get you sweating before you know it. Aerobics, and muscle conditioning programs, with resistance bands. Stretching program...All are FUN FUN FUN!!Another update: 10/15/2011...After spinal surgery I was not able to rigorously run as prior; and I gained a few pounds. When I started this program I was wearing a 1x/16 in womens. Now I can wear missy xl; which is a 14. That's only working out lightly, @ least a minimum of 10 minutes a day; and sometimes skipping a few days. Most people plateu due to the issue of going full steam ahead in the beginning; if you start out at full intense, your body has no where to climb. Do ya get what I am saying? Keep your workouts steady, and consistant; with a few routine changes; then you will be able to maintain your work outs over the duration. And you will continue to loose the weight. Always remember to consume plenty of water daily. Some people may find it hard to do, but when you start it, you'll feel the difference in your body, your skin, and energy level.
