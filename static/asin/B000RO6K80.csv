Instead of just binoculars and an old fashioned flash camera, we have cell phones, computers, and video cameras. Not just relying on technology, the movie is a thoroughly enjoyable voyeur fantasy. Starting from ""the girl next door"" to unsettling sights across the way, Kane (Shia LaBeouf), an older adolescent, has had troubled times. With a father dead in an auto accident in which Kane was present, he is shackled to a detector on his ankle in a house arrest for ""popping out"" his teacher who made a dishonorable remark about his recently deceased dad. Mom is loving and understanding but won't put up with much.All the technology points to his neighbors. First it's attraction (Carrie-Anne Moss); then, it's suspicion, for Robert Turner, whose kinky escapades with loose women come and go, giving mixed messages. Much like `Undertow' in the sense that Kane's troubled past gives him hardly a leg to stand on, the protagonist finds himself in trouble up to his chin. 'Disturbia' has some familiar components including some false scares that are overly reminiscent of 'Halloween' and other horror/ thrillers, but the editing is so expert, one seldom cares. Thoroughly entertaining, the cast and screenplay keep the story real, and director D.J. Caruso keeps the pace admirably slick and believable.  Furthermore, Shia LaBeouf is a wonder as the thoroughly believable and effective role as Kane.  Expertly paced, 'Disturbia' is an understandably taut and enjoyable crowd favorite.",4,Fantastic Voyeur,1187568000,"08 20, 2007",2007,1576,"['Based', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Rear', 'Window', 'Disturbia', 'hardware', ""'d"", 'might', 'expect', 'Instead', 'just', 'binoculars', 'old', 'fashioned', 'flash', 'camera', 'have', 'cell', 'phones', 'computers', 'video', 'cameras', 'Not', 'just', 'relying', 'technology', 'movie', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'voyeur', 'fantasy', 'Starting', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'unsettling', 'sights', 'way', 'Kane', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'older', 'adolescent', 'had', 'troubled', 'times', 'father', 'dead', 'auto', 'accident', 'Kane', 'was', 'present', 'shackled', 'detector', 'ankle', 'house', 'arrest', 'popping', 'out', 'teacher', 'who', 'made', 'dishonorable', 'remark', 'recently', 'deceased', 'dad', 'Mom', 'loving', 'understanding', 'wo', ""n't"", 'put', 'up', 'technology', 'points', 'neighbors', 'First', 'attraction', 'Carrie-Anne', 'Moss', 'then', 'suspicion', 'Robert', 'Turner', 'kinky', 'loose', 'women', 'come', 'go', 'giving', 'mixed', 'messages', 'Much', 'Undertow', 'sense', 'Kane', 'troubled', 'past', 'hardly', 'leg', 'stand', 'protagonist', 'trouble', 'up', 'chin', 'familiar', 'components', 'including', 'false', 'scares', 'are', 'overly', 'reminiscent', ""'Halloween"", 'other', 'horror/', 'thrillers', 'editing', 'so', 'expert', 'one', 'seldom', 'cares', 'Thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'cast', 'screenplay', 'keep', 'story', 'real', 'director', 'D.J', 'Caruso', 'pace', 'admirably', 'slick', 'believable', 'Furthermore', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'wonder', 'thoroughly', 'believable', 'effective', 'role', 'Kane', 'Expertly', 'paced', 'understandably', 'taut', 'enjoyable', 'crowd', 'favorite']",N/A

1082953,AMP7TQRWAIE84,B000RO6K80,"Adrian Cooper ""That Guy from Venus. :D""","[2, 3]","Shia LeBeouf is outstanding in this movie. Besides being an eye-catcher to the ladies, he actually shows good emotion throughout, the key scene being the car crash.He's on house arrest for punching out a totally disrespectful teacher who stepped out of line. Instead of doing anything productive, he plays army games online with the headset and all, mimicking one of the many interests of my eldest brother, eating so unhealthily and trying oh so hard to stay out of trouble while unable to do anything at all.The neighborhood he happens to live in is anything but boring. There's a cheating spouse over yonder, a hot new neighborhood girl next door (Ashley) and a possible killer across the street who mows his lawn all too often.It's a suspenseful thriller at heart but you really wouldn't know that unless you looked at your guide or heard about it previously to watching the film. The actual action slowly, slowly comes about. But it's all worth it in the end.Without destroying the major highlights of this movie I will say that this movie takes many turns; some that you will predict easily and some that will leave you speechless. There were only a few moments where I wasn't that interested in the movie and I still don't understand the ""low"" rating here.In fact, I liked the movie so much, especially by the ending that I will refuse to look at a lot of negative reviews here. I usually look at both, tend to check out the 3's and 2's first but won't do so for this one.It is what it is and I found that interesting. The characters were well-rounded, the questions I had throughout the movie were answered (minus maybe one) and the acting was more than decent.Worth your time and recommended.4.3 stars.End note: Ashley playing hard to get was one of the most awesome personal parts in the movie. What Shia admits to her on the roof when she holds his Ipod was the true highlight in this aspect as well as one of the highlights of the movie period.The alternative music that Shia jammed to in this film was pretty good.

1082955,AORXL977W3KI7,B000RO6K80,Aging  Boomer,"[1, 3]","At a general level the film is a remake of Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 classic ""Rear Window"", with a plot essentially the same as that movie's, and Shia LaBeouf, Sarah Roemer, and David Morse in the roles, respectively, of Jimmy Stewart, Grace Kelly, and Raymond Burr. What's different is that ""Disturbia"" involves California teens in the first decade of the twenty-first century, not thirty-something New Yorkers in the early 1950s.  The suburban-teen milieu makes possible a few additional characters, including a best friend, and a Mom played by forty year old (can it be true?) Carrie Anne Moss, but it also eliminates the myriad apartment-dwelling neighbors whose micro-stories lent extra visual and emotional spice to ""Rear Window"". ""Disturbia"" rather beguilingly initiates the viewer into the teens' sensibilities, and for once the adult characters are not clueless, though a middle-aged audience member is likely to find more than one song that he or she remembers fondly being mercilessly mocked by the kids as ""music my parents like"". The appeal of the young actors makes the suspense and ensuing danger that much more compelling, but it all goes down a bit too smoothly and pleasantly, without any of the darker undertones of Hitchcock's predecessor. These kids are not obsessed with what they're watching--they are just bored, bright and brash. The viewer is not, as in ""Rear Window"", drawn into another's compulsive voyeurism; we remain outside the action, watching what becomes just another scary movie of the slasher subgenre. In fifty years people will still be watching ""Rear Window"", but not, one suspects, ""Disturbia"".",3,Hitchcock Lite,1177459200,"04 25, 2007",2007,1633,"['general', 'level', 'film', 'remake', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', '1954', 'classic', 'Rear', 'Window', 'plot', 'essentially', 'same', 'movie', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'Sarah', 'Roemer', 'David', 'Morse', 'roles', 'respectively', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'Raymond', 'Burr', 'What', 'different', 'Disturbia', 'California', 'teens', 'first', 'decade', 'twenty-first', 'century', 'not', 'thirty-something', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'early', '1950s', 'suburban-teen', 'milieu', 'possible', 'few', 'additional', 'characters', 'including', 'best', 'friend', 'Mom', 'played', 'forty', 'year', 'old', 'can', 'be', 'true', 'Carrie', 'Anne', 'Moss', 'also', 'myriad', 'apartment-dwelling', 'neighbors', 'micro-stories', 'lent', 'extra', 'visual', 'emotional', 'spice', 'Rear', 'Window', 'Disturbia', 'rather', 'beguilingly', 'viewer', 'teens', 'sensibilities', 'once', 'adult', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'clueless', 'middle-aged', 'audience', 'member', 'likely', 'find', 'more', 'one', 'song', 'fondly', 'being', 'mercilessly', 'mocked', 'kids', 'music', 'parents', 'appeal', 'young', 'actors', 'suspense', 'ensuing', 'danger', 'much', 'more', 'compelling', 'down', 'bit', 'too', 'smoothly', 'pleasantly', 'darker', 'undertones', 'Hitchcock', 'predecessor', 'kids', 'are', 'not', 'obsessed', 'what', ""'re"", 'watching', 'are', 'just', 'bored', 'bright', 'brash', 'viewer', 'not', 'Rear', 'Window', 'drawn', 'compulsive', 'voyeurism', 'remain', 'action', 'watching', 'what', 'just', 'scary', 'movie', 'slasher', 'subgenre', 'fifty', 'years', 'people', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'watching', 'Rear', 'Window', 'not', 'one', 'Disturbia']",N/A

1082957,A3GI6DS6I474K8,B000RO6K80,"Alan Draven ""Dark Fiction Author""","[62, 69]","Kale (Shia Labeouf), a teenager who recently lost his father in a car accident, is on house arrest after punching his teacher. He soon gets bored with too much time on his hands and starts spying on his sexy new neighbor Ashley (Sarah Roemer). One night, while watching the news on TV, Kale hears about a missing girl and an eyewitness report describing a suspect's car. Kale realizes that his next door neighbor, Mr. Turner (David Morse), has the same vintage car of the same color also with a dent in the bumper. Mr. Turner brings a woman home one night and Kale witnesses some rough play through the open curtains. He begins to suspect him of being the missing girl's killer and starts to spy on him with cameras and binoculars.Disturbia is directed by D.J. Caruso (The Salton Sea, Taking Lives) and is molded after Alfred Hitchcock's classic thriller, Rear Window. I really wasn't expecting too much from this one other than it was a Caruso film, a director whose work I admire. I must say that I was pleasantly surprised; the plot and characters sucked me in almost right away. The film has a similar premise as the one in Rear Window, but with all its gadgets, flashy shot compositions, and younger target audience, it really feels like a fresh approach to a cool idea.The script was well written in the sense that it took time to set things up, to develop its characters, and provide us with enough twists and turns so that we never have time to look at our watches. The tension increases a lot in the last half-hour of the film and builds to a climax that doesn't fall into the clich&eacute;s of the recent suspense/thrillers. Shia Labeouf shows promise as a young actor, bringing depth to his character. Sarah Roemer was also pretty good, showing us that she's more than a pretty face and a hot body. David Morse (The Rock, The Green Mile) was great as usual as the neighbor who may-or-may-not-be a serial killer. Caruso's got another hit under his belt, much more satisfying than Taking Lives was for that matter.If you're a fan of Hitchcock's Rear Window, you might really enjoy this one; it's much more than your average sugar-coated teenage flick. Horror fans and thriller aficionados will find something to sink their teeth in as well.

1082958,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B000RO6K80,Alex Udvary,"[6, 7]","Alfred Hitchcock just won't go away. It has been 30 years since Hitchcock directed his last film, ""Family Plot"", but his work still seems fresh and original as it continues to inspire young directors. In 2007 we have already had two Hitchcockian rip-offs, ""Vacancy"" and this film.""Disturbia"" follows Kale (Shia LaBeouf) who is sentenced to three months house arrest after hitting his Spanish teacher, after the teacher made insensitive remarks towards Kale's dad who passed away in a suspious car accident in which Kale was also part of.Kale is about to go stir crazy after his mother, Julie (Carrie-Anne Moss) takes away his x-box, TV and itunes, now Kale may actually have to do something constructive! But don't worry, Kale is not going to fall for that, he creates a nice diversion for himself by spying on his neighbors who include a new family to the neighborhood and their very pretty daughter, Ashley (Sarah Roemer) as well as Mr. Turner (David Morse), whom Kale suspects is actually a serial killer responsible for the recent disappearances of several young girls.Now if the idea of a person locked up in their house, spying on their neighbors and thinking they have unwittingly stumbled upon a murder scene reminds you of anything it should be Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"".""Rear Window"" has Jimmy Stewart as a wheel-chair bound photographer whom after spying on his neighbors thinks he has seen one of them kill their wife. Now, with the help of Grace Kelly and Thelma Ritter, the trio will try to solve the case the police seem to ignore.I guess that makes Shia LaBeouf the Jimmy Stewart of this movie, Sarah Roemer is our Grace Kelly and LaBeouf's best friend in the movie, Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) is our Thelma Ritter. Of course the obviously fault with the film, when compared to the work of Hitchcock is, the movie isn't nearly as suspenseful or well crafted.""Disturbia"" suffers from two problems. Number one it goes for cheap scares. It follows the basic formula most thrillers follow and because of that it leads us to our second problem. The movie is predictable. We know Mr. Turner is going to be the killer and Kale was right all along if for any reason, does it seem logical for a movie to take us down this path, build up all this ""suspense"", devote so much time to this idea, and then suddenly it turns out not to be Mr. Turner? Also, what other suspects does Kale have? So, since all the chips are placed on Mr. Turner being the killer, it simply must be.So okay, right now you are saying, well you know what moron, when I saw ""Rear Window"" I knew Raymond Bur was the killer. Here's the difference. Since we know how the film is going to turn out, the only thing which will keep our interest will be the characters. It's all we have left. Unless the film is smartly written and strongly acted we have no reason to continue watching. And that is where ""Disturbia"" goes wrong. I didn't care about these characters. Whether they live or die had no impact on me. I was never fully involved in what was going on.Shia LaBeouf seems to be getting a lot of work lately. He has already created a persona for himself. In nearly every film he is in he plays the same character. The geeky, well meaning, loser who lust after the pretty girl who doesn't notice him. In his world he think he is cool, to the rest of us, he is out of touch. Watch him in ""I, Robot"" or ""Transformers"" and you will see what I mean. I'm not saying LaBeouf has no talent. He does, but just like any other actor, he needs a good script. His persona worked in other films, but here he doesn't seem compelling on-screen.The rest of the cast actually out shines LaBeouf. Supporting players like Roemer and Yoo are far more interesting to watch. Yoo is given better jokes and Roemer is simply better looking than LaBeouf so my eyes tended to follow her more when the two were both in a scene together.The film was directed by D.J. Caruso. Caruso is a good director. A few years ago he directed a Val Kilmer movie called ""The Salton Sea"". It was a truly great film. He followed it up with an Angelina Jolie thriller, ""Taking Lives"", which I didn't like. But Caruso has talent. He can direct a scene and know how to get the most from his characters as was the case with Kilmer and Jolie. But what hurts him here is the script. Carl Ellsworth co-wrote the film, and even he too has done better. He wrote the thriller ""Red Eye"" which worked much better. That film had interesting characters and had a few suspenseful moments.""Disturbia"" may have a nice look to some but really isn't a very engaging picture. The cast and director are both talented but there is little anyone could do with this weak script.Bottom-line: An Alfred Hitchcock knock-off that isn't anywhere near as suspenseful as the master's films. Good cast and director but the weak script brings everything to a halt.",2,"Disturbed by ""Disturbia""",1186876800,"08 12, 2007",2007,4861,"['Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'away',

1082961,AUW8TCRK9EDQ6,B000RO6K80,Andre LeBlanc,"[2, 4]","Disturbia is a modernized remake of Alfred Hitchock's ""Rear Window,"" which places it a great disadvantage from the start.  Hitchcock is somebody who just can't be credibly recreated.  The biggest problem I have with this film, though, is the fact that it is clearly aimed at teenagers.  If you are over 25 (35 in my case), you are probably going to be disappointed and a little annoyed at this film.  The lead character (a teenage boy) punches his spanish teacher in the face and is sentenced to spend his summer break on house arrest.  After his mother takes away his internet accounts and television, he decides to pass the time by spying on his neighbors.  Most of the film involves him and his buddy spying on the cute teenage girl who lives next door.  Of course a romance soon develops between them.  On the good side, once you've made it through the first 45 minutes or so, the pace of the film really picks up.  The lead character soon suspects that another one of his neighbors is a serial killer.  As him and his friends try to find the truth, the film actually becomes rather engrossing.  The final scenes of the film are really quite good.  I just wish they had made this film with an adult lead character and aimed at an adult audience.

In `Disturbia' he takes on the teen-horror flick and does so well enough.  `Disturbia' is not brilliant, and it is nothing new, but thanks to some well placed intensity it does serve it's purpose in getting under our skin.Kale Brecht is a tad bit troubled after losing his father to a devastating car accident.  His bottled rage leads him to slugging out his Spanish teacher and lands him under house-arrest.  With a lot of spare time on his hands Kale finds himself spying on the neighbors.  There's the little boys across the street that watch adult movies while their mother isn't around.  There's the hot young thing across the street named Ashley.  And then there's the creepy next door neighbor, Robert Turner (not to be mistaken for Robbie Turner, the doomed hero from `Atonement'), who may or may not be a crazed serial killer from Texas.Following the formula of obvious inspiration `Rear Window' yet incorporating a whole vast array of new age gadgets and tricks, `Disturbia' manages to become its own little movie instead of a tired copycat.Shia LeBeouf is believable here as the hero.  His teenage curiosity and immature approach is realistic and engaging.  Sarah Roemer is so-so at best as his love interest Ashley.  She's pretty, I'll give her that, but she's not too impressive on the acting side of it all.  Aaron Yoo, the sidekick best friend, is funny and entertaining.  The real star though is David Morse who is just brilliantly on point as the creepy next door neighbor.  He's always a brilliant villain and here he doesn't disappoint.  I really wish he would get some high profile gigs.  Carrie-Anne Moss is a little lost here (the script has no use for her until the very end) but that doesn't mean she doesn't try.In the end `Disturbia' comes off a little `Rear Window', a little `Domestic Disturbance', maybe even a little `The Cell' (it's all in the ending) but it's all its own movie.

I dont particularly care.This story had potential!In the classic sense of a hitchcock thrillers, this movie would have done so much better if they didnt try and fit as many branded products into the movie so that the studio wouldnt have to put a dime in. A real shame since so many great movies now give up a lot for the sake of product placement in the movie.What product placement you say? How about our hero lebouf in question is sitting at home eating smuckers and twinkies while playing his xbox 360 and swilling cans of red bull while he stocks his ipod with ""60 gb of his life"" while filming his neighbour serenade his mum with a panasonic camera in his mustang which was dented but suddenly its not when all the while he cant help but perv on his neighbour who drives her father's BMW X5 chatting to her friends on her nokia while his strange but quirky asian friend (note: they had to have an asian kid in it! how else will you represent a minority in a movie full of gadgets? Blacks and Mexicans, it seems, wouldnt fit) with HIS nokia phone multi tasking and his cRaZy hair do playing his PSP drinking red bull too eating dominos who winds up breaking into a lexus and walking around with a little slugger baseball bat to help save the day while helping to spy on his friends neighbour with some cool branded binoculars.I mean this is how much the movie sold itself out: the final line of the movie is our hero lebouf and his love interest, making out while his friend is filming them who then turns around and says ""This is so going on youtube""... and they just continue as if he's not there?!WOW. What a meaningful and appropriate line for this two hour advertisment! What a creepy way to end it too, as if the movie director didnt see the point in showing that despite vouyerism got everyone into this whole mess, ""its still ok to do so cause we have to work on theme a bit LOL"".What a waste of time, and there I was thinking how awesome would it be if Labeouf made this whole story up in his head, became the actual stalker and wound up killing his neighbour, the girl he likes and then bricks on his friends chest while they serenade each other over how stupid they thought the audience and Labeoufs neighbours were.

Now, decades later, director D.J. Caruso thinks we all need a refresher course in this fun, stylish, and entertaining little thriller. While this movie may not be wildly original, I saw it the same day as ""The Hitcher"" re-make, so it seemed like a breath of fresh air!.17 year old Kale(Shia LaBeauf)suffers a horrible tragedy early in the film. A year later, things are obviously different for him. He gets in trouble for punching a teacher at school, and is sentenced to 3 months house arrest(complete with an ankle monitor that would make Martha Stewart jealous). Basically trapped with only so far he can go from his lawn before it goes off, Kale ends up spending his time spying on his neighbors. A hot new girl named Ashley(Sarah Roemer)moves in next door and, while romance blossoms, something else pops up. A neighbor named Mr. Turner(the great David Morse), may or may not be a serial killer. And Kale and his friends may or may not be next.The movie is pretty well set up, and the idea of the leg monitor and having restricted access to the outside world was a fun idea that is used to it's worth. It creates some fun moments, and some genuinely suspenseful ones as well. These moments of the film are pretty effective and well planned. We've all pretty much seen it before, but director Caruso and his talented cast make it a lot of fun, with characters and situations we actually like. It's all very slick and entertaining.I am not one that has yet jumped on the Shia bandwagon, but it is clear that the guy has talent and is going somewhere. His Kale comes across as a genuine kid who has been through something. His buddy is the comical relief, and Sarah Roemer as Ashley is a beauty. Carrie Ann-Moss has the typical role as Kale's mother. But it was David Morse who made the movie to me. His face looks like it has a history. One minute he seems very quiet, shy, and like he couldn't hurt a fly. The next second you are unsure. Could this guy kill someone?. He gave the best performance of the movie for me.""Disturbia"" isn't treading new ground, but it delivered a pretty fun, well made, entertaining thrill ride that I enjoyed quite a lot from beginning to end. The performances were acceptable(some more than others), and the direction slick and polished. An updated, modern day version of ""Rear Window"" that should be given a look.

At first glance one assumes the film caters to the teen age group but it is a film for everyone.  Adults will enjoy this just as much.Shia LaBeouf started with independent films and this was his first high profile film.  He is the star and he shines here.  The film rests on his shoulders and how his character deals with all that occurs to him.  He provides a fully drawn out, three dimensional interpretation with a lot on his plate.  We understand how he got to be on house arrest and we care.  His character is real, a true teenager - he is intelligent, sarcastic and loves the ladies.  In other words you must believe in this person for the premise of the movie to make sense and Shia carries this off with flying colors.Comparisons to Hitchcock make sense but the familiar theme is done in a new and original way.  I must admit that when I first saw the film I really enjoyed it but found the ending a little subpar.  Upon second viewing it all clicked for me and I thoroughly loved it and loved getting caught up in the slowly building suspense and quality acting.I must reiterate how rare it is to have a suspense film without gore and it works here very succesfully.  The characters carry it and you will be on the edge of your seat.

While in his home all day, he has nothing to do but start a hobby where he spies on his neighbors all day.  This turns out to be both good AND bad.  Good in that, his new neighbor turns out to be an attractive female around his age, and he develops a relationship with her as the story goes along.  Bad in that, you guessed it, one of the neighbors is a killer.Throughout the movie you're left guessing whether this supposed killer is actually doing any killing, or whether the teenager is just imagining all the things he believes he sees.

The set-up seems a little overdone with the coming-of-age Kale Brecht receiving fatherly wisdom in the serenity of a mountain stream.The moment, predictably, is not to last, and after a bad accident we flash forward one year to find that Kale Brecht is a lousy student with emotional problems, who earns himself a summer of house arrest after lashing out at one of his teachers.When Kale's unsympathetic Mom (played by Carrie-Anne Moss) orders him to clean his room (after killing his TV and shutting down his iTunes and Xbox 360), Kale becomes desperate for external stimuli, and begins his metamorphosis into a teenage voyeur.  He points cameras and binoculars all over the neighborhood, and soon knows quite a bit more than he probably should about his neighbors.His spying quickly leads him to the discovery of a gorgeous girl next door named Ashley, who spends a lot of time swimming and lounging about in skimpy outfits, much to the delight of Kale.  As a bonus, she isn't at all creeped out by Kale apparently spying on her, or the fact that he has obviously had a bit of a run-in with the law.Ashley and Kale become friends, and joined by Kale's horny tagalong Ronnie, the trio soon begins to suspect their neighbor Robert Turner (played by the always-creepy David Morse) in connection with a crime that's reported on the local TV news.  Turner's car matches an eyewitness description, and Kale sees him dragging a suspicious package into his garage.A cat-and-mouse game transpires with the characters trying to discover information about the alleged killer, while the movie clumsily reminds us of Kale's limiting predicament.The movie is obviously inspired to a large degree by Rear Window, and its imitation is unapologetic at times.  However, where Hitchcock's classic made the characters resolve the situation within the strong confines of the film's initial premise, Disturbia eventually abandons it in favor of an awkward search-and-rescue mission involving Kale and his mother that feels tacked on and out-of-place.Despite the movie's primary flaws (It's too predictable, it lacks any real chills or scares, and the romantic relationship between Kale and Ashley is wholly unconvincing), Disturbia still does a decent job of keeping the film from becoming too much of a Rear Window rip-off, all the while updating it for today's younger viewer.For those who haven't seen Rear Window, this movie may even come across as better than it actually is.  For those who've seen and admired the Hitchcock classic, however, it is barely any more than a pale imitation.",3,When the Average Imitates the Masterful - Disturbia ensues,1192060800,"10 11, 2007",2007,2692,"['Disturbia', 'sequence', 'pure', 'exposition', 'built', 'classic', 'father/son', 'bonding', 'experience', 'fly', 'fishing', 'set-up', 'little', 'overdone', 'coming-of-age', 'Kale', 'Brecht', 'receiving', 'fatherly', 'wisdom', 'serenity', 'mountain', 'stream.The', 'moment', 'predictably', 'not', 'last', 'bad', 'accident', 'flash', 'forward', 'one', 'year', 'find', 'Kale', 'Brecht', 'lousy', 'student', 'emotional', 'problems', 'who', 'summer', 'house', 'arrest', 'lashing', 'out', 'one', 'teachers.When', 'Kale', 'unsympathetic', 'Mom', 'played', 'Carrie-Anne', 'Moss', 'orders', 'clean', 'room', 'killing', 'TV', 'shutting', 'down', 'iTunes', 'Xbox', '360', 'Kale', 'desperate', 'external', 'stimuli', 'metamorphosis', 'teenage', 'voyeur', 'cameras', 'binoculars', 'neighborhood', 'soon', 'quite', 'bit', 'more', 'probably', 'should', 'about', 'neighbors.His', 'spying', 'quickly', 'discovery', 'gorgeous', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'named', 'Ashley', 'who', 'lot', 'time', 'swimming', 'lounging', 'about', 'skimpy', 'outfits', 'much', 'delight', 'Kale', 'bonus', ""n't"", 'creeped', 'out', 'Kale', 'apparently', 'spying', 'fact', 'obviously', 'had', 'bit', 'run-in', 'law.Ashley', 'Kale', 'become', 'friends', 'joined', 'Kale', 'horny', 'tagalong', 'Ronnie', 'trio', 'soon', 'suspect', 'neighbor', 'Robert', 'Turner', 'played', 'always-creepy', 'David', 'Morse', 'connection', 'crime', 'reported', 'local', 'TV', 'news', 'Turner', 'car', 'eyewitness', 'description', 'Kale', 'dragging', 'suspicious', 'package', 'garage.A', 'cat-and-mouse', 'game', 'transpires', 'characters', 'trying', 'discover', 'information', 'alleged', 'killer', 'movie', 'clumsily', 'Kale', 'limiting', 'predicament.The', 'movie', 'obviously', 'inspired', 'large', 'degree', 'Rear', 'Window', 'imitation', 'unapologetic', 'times', 'However', 'where', 'Hitchcock', 'classic', 'made', 'characters', 'resolve', 'situation', 'strong', 'confines', 'film', 'initial', 'premise', 'Disturbia', 'eventually', 'favor', 'awkward', 'search-and-rescue', 'mission', 'involving', 'Kale', 'mother', 'tacked', 'out-of-place.Despite', 'movie', 'primary', 'flaws', 'too', 'predictable', 'real', 'chills', 'scares', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'Kale', 'Ashley', 'wholly', 'unconvincing', 'Disturbia', 'still', 'decent', 'job', 'keeping', 'film', 'becoming', 'too', 'much', 'Rear', 'Window', 'rip-off', 'updating', 'today', 'younger', 'viewer.For', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Rear', 'Window', 'movie', 'may', 'even', 'come', 'better', 'actually', 'who', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'admired', 'Hitchcock', 'classic', 'however', 'barely', 'more', 'pale', 'imitation']",N/A

Stripped of his video games, TV, and other gadgets, Kale is crushed by boredom. Then, a beautiful gal named Ashley (Sarah Roemer) moves in next door. Kale begins spying on her, as well as the rest of his neighbors, in an obvious nod to REAR WINDOW. Soon, Kale notices some suspicious activity from a certain Mr. Turner (David Morse), and thinks he just might be responsible for a series of disappearances. Teaming up w/ Ashley and his friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo), Kale sets out to find evidence that could prove his theories about the odd Mr. Turner. DISTURBIA is a taught thriller w/ good doses of humor to help give us a false sense of security. As others have said, REAR WINDOW immediately pops into mind here. However, other movies have used similar themes. For instance- THE BURBS, FRIGHT NIGHT, ABOMINABLE, and of course, DePalma's BODY DOUBLE- all have the same basic elements, done in drastically differing ways. As for any resemblance to THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, well, BLAIR WITCH itself owes an awful lot to CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST, and even the ""helmet-cam"" sequences in ALIENS pre-date TBWP by several years! Anyway, DISTURBIA is one of the better PG-13 movies I've seen, using suspense and atmosphere to build tension. Not all thriller / horror movies need to be R-rated.

Ten years from now he will have a resume' to rival that of Tom Crusie ""before his eggs quit flipping, if you know what I mean"". He has the talent  and screen presence to be a leading man for a long time. He is a good/going to be a great character/action/romance actor. I truly believe the sky is the limit, unless of course he gets drunk and mows down three old broads going to the grocery store.  His girlfriend in the movie really had this Jennifer Beale thing going. The movie probably would have worked better had his best friend became Chinese sausage meat.  I am always critical of slasher/horror/thrillers having so much blood and guts to the point where it desensitizes the viewers. I would say that is the exact opposite of this one. We did not get to see not one murder. One murder would have educated the viewers of the threat to all of our key players. After all the neighbor from St. Elsewhere, who, by the way did an excellent job, is a serial killer. The cameras should have been inside the house when he butchered the red-head, even if he had to murder her later on in the movie. If there is a murderer in a movie, we really need to SEE one , not know that one has taken place. We needed to see blood once, not blood and guts or entrail eating or neighbor disembowelment.  This did subtract from the  movie.A mail lead usually does not work in this genre, but Shia is young enough and innocent enough to pull off the ""don't hurt the deer in the headlight"" that every audience yearns for in thrillers. The crash sequence pertaining to his father , in the begining, was excellently done. The subsequent rebellion and angst was performed perfectly. I loved this movie. One other thing would have helped this movie. If the teachers' cousin, the cop, had been more of a butthole to LaBeouf's character, we would've appreciated his death a little more. If the officer, had helped LaBeouf in the end, changing our opinion of the officer, then getting beaten a little more before his neck problems, this would have made us even more satisfied when the killer got his.All in all, a very good movie, with a break out star, in a break out role.

Has his house arrest finally gotten to him, or does he know something that everyone else is unaware of?Critique: `Disturbia' is a blending of two earlier films that you've probably seen, the classic `Rear Window' from '54 and the cult classic horror `Fright Night' from '85. `Disturbia' does add some nuances of its own to the mixture, the best being the talented Shia LaBeof who's performance alone makes this movie worth watching. He sure likes to do alot of running in his films, mark my words Shia is destined to become the next Tom Cruise. If you enjoyed the two previously mentioned films you should enjoy this one as well.

You would have to have been sequestered in a cave your entire life or be totally blind to miss all the many creative liberties Mr. Caruso has taken with the Jimmy Stewart classic, ""Rear Window,"" to assume anything less. Having said that, however, I still must say I enjoyed this movie far more than I previously anticipated. Christopher Landon's screenplay, while somewhat predictable, still manages to throw enough surprises at you through its performances.The aspiring Shia LaBeouf takes front and center stage here as young troublemaker, Kale Brecht. Kale, when he's not spying on his neighbors or causing fire and brimstone to rain down all around him, is actually quite the average and overall likeable kid. With the tragic death of his father serving as the motivation behind his unfortunate scuffle with a high school teacher, Kale has landed himself a three month house arrest. It is during this excruciating stretch that he begins to suspect his next-door neighbor might actually be the same elusive serial killer he's been following on the local news.That's honestly the main story, right there. I will kindly refrain from spoiling anything further for those who still have yet to see this for themselves.Now, I may normally not adhere to this type of film. But I was very pleasantly entertained. The clever nods to Hitchcock, as I've already mentioned, along with the collective contributions by La Beouf and David Morse, are what really helped hold my attention. This, plain and simply, is the sort of movie you watch with friends on a Friday night. It's not going to win over the gore hounds or those looking for grindhouse style shocks. This is PG-13 mainstream quality fare, at best. But it's also a motion picture I can freely admit I had fun with.",3,A fairly solid effort.

That said anyone claiming this movie stole from his ""Rear Window"" hasn't seen Hitchcock's movie in awhile or doesn't get it. I have seen all the Hitchcock remakes and movies following his style. I regularly go back and watch Hitchcock's movies and I just didn't see it duplicated here. Far to many things that are quite different from the original but even if there was a similarity because it is based on it I think Hitch would have gotten a kick out of this movie. I found it very entertaining and well acted. The directing, sets, and effects were nicely done. It reminded me of the better teen thrillers with much more put into suspense and not so much in gory hack and slash and heavy metallica. Fans of the movies like ""The Lookout"", ""Cellular"" and ""Phone Booth"" will probably enjoy it.A young man is devastated over the loss of his father in an auto accident so he commits a few minor misdemeanors and ends up under house arrest with a foot monitor. While watching his neighbors, his best friend drops by regularly. They meet the new girl that moved in next door and start hanging out together. He starts noticing some odd things after hearing about a girls disappearance and a early model Mustang with a dent in it. It seems one of his neighbors drives such a car. As he observes more he becomes more suspicious and concerned for his mother and girlfriend. I recommend this movie. You don't have to be a teenager to enjoy this movie. I recommend this for purchasing since it has good replayability and most teens and adults will enjoy it.

It finds a troubled young teen who is sentenced to house arrest after a violent episode at school. With nothing left to do, he takes to watching the neighbors, but finds out more than he wanted to when he witnesses a series of suspicious activities taking place next door. For a polished Teen Horror flick, it delivers plenty of action, comedy, and suspense in a pretty little package. Shia LeBeouf hits his stride as the average, everyday boy next door in a winning performance that is single-handedly responsible for the overall success of the picture. The script is smart and well written considering its target audience, which allows for a greater appeal to both the teen and older Horror crowds. Where the film makes its greatest misstep is in its largely overblown finale, which would have been much more effective if it had been scaled back to a more subtle end.

This movie is fun, it is interesting and really whacky at times.  I did like the actors and actresses that were in it.  Catherine Moss, I mean she kicked soooooo much booty in the Matrix so we reallllllllly cannot go wrong having her in the film.*********Spoiler Alert***************Ahem...okay people there are some things we need to realize here, and one is how law enforcement handles these things.  ""These things"" you ask me, what are these things?  These things are like how the cops handled the bag in the garage scene.  Okay that was even on the previews so I am not giving too much away there so gimme some credit!  So, the first part is handled good but after the driveway/discovery scene...no.  Sorry people but you cannot have anything like that on the premises and it would be brought into great question.  For one, that is a health hazard and it does not matter ""what"" it is, if it ain't breathing it needs to be in da ground.  Secondly, Mr Turner (the crazy neighbor) had an answer when asked the question...no he was not even asked he just immediately explained why how what where and so forth.  That explanation in itself would bring into great question just how messed up this guy is.  When something like that happens you place it outside of the roadway to avoid causing a traffic accident, and then call the local Fish and Game office in the local area.  You see they keep tabs on things like that, statistics ya know?****************Spoiler Alert**********************Allllllllrighty then!  Next up we have the way it finished up, starting with the visit by the kids mom.  Okay Why or how would Mr. Turner do that?  Well the movie would have you think he suspected someone was on to him.  The problem is with this, is that there was no way he knew that friend of the boy's even saw anything.  You saw the entire layout of the house, this guy would know if that kid was able to film something.  I guess in Mr. Turner's case it was better to be safe than sorry.**************Spoiler Alert (it is okay, I Am almost done)**************Awrighty friends, so the parking garage scene when the girl was leaving after following him to the hardware store.  Nope, sorry friends because as soon as that guy got into that vehicle and touched her she could have had him in a whole heapa (yes, HEAPA is a word, it means mega heaps or gigantic piles of) trouble and by the time he got out of jail his house would already have new people buying it from a foreclosure.  So, how did he fake out the scene with the call girl leaving?  I saw as you did, now c'mon did he really have that great of legs and a nice figure enough to be able to pose as her walking to the vehicle?  Of course not, those broad shoulders and thick legs, combined with some cord like forearms and a lumberjack's walk would have given him away in no time.  Sorry I cannot see that guy wearing high heels people.**************Spoiler end Alert!**********************I liked it, fun for the whole family as it is PG-13 but do not think you will not get some bikini shots here and there, especially with those kids next do..whoops I forgot a spoiler alert on dat one.************Spoiler Alert!**********************The oriental fellow trying to break into the car, in daylight in a very visible area in a middle to high class neighborhood?

But films like ""Disturbia"" show just how unhip the old man is becoming. This is quite obviously a ""Rear Window"" rip off with our hero here Kale (Shia LeBeouf) being restrained to his premises by a police tag as opposed to a broken leg. He gets bored, notices a strange neighbor, suspects foul play, gets in over his head. Only now everybody is 20 years younger and the main focus is keeping the camera fixed on the hot young things as they slip in and out of their bathing suits. There is a lot to like here but an enjoyable first half gives way to a generic suspense thriller that is really only tacked on because we the people demand it.Kale is in trouble because after his dad's death some smart mouthed teacher cracks wise about it and subsequently gets his clocked cleaned for his trouble. I found it odd that Kale's mother thought that defending her late husband's honor was less important that protecting some lame know-it-all's jaw, but what do I know? And since Kale is not spending his house arrest time constructively (this is implied by showing him playing X-Box, watching trash TV and spending alone time in the bathroom. . .but I digress) all of his modern amenities are taken away by his mother, leaving him and his unoccupied brain to spy on the neighbors. This part of the film, a razor sharp commentary on the suburbs (it is apparently filled with perverted little boys and mass murderers) is darn good. I also really liked Kale's interactions with his friends Ronnie and Ashley as I found them to be realistically centered on sex, technology and insults. You will, however, have to forgive them the scene lifted directly from ""Girl Next Door,"" wet blonde hair and all. But as time passed my generally good mood gave way to a sense of aggravation. Why did the three acts have to be carved in stone? Why was everything so predictable? Why did they even include the horror aspects? Once I realized that everything would go down exactly as I thought it would my positive review turned into a negative one.As with all Peeping Tom movies the director here (DJ Caruso) felt the need to point out that we the viewer are also watchers. This is especially effective here as we the viewer ogle Ashley's body we have to watch the somewhat disturbing shot of Kale doing the same thing. I'm sure this point was lost on most of the popcorn-munchers (especially the linebacker seated directly next to me) but it was a neat touch to be simultaneously jealous of and repulsed by Kale's hair sniffing. To make matters worse the Ashley character is one dimensional, just a tease with control of her sexuality well beyond her years.  Not that Kale minds as his attention turns from infatuation into possessiveness.  LaBeouf's performance is awesome as that rarest of creations, a Hollywood character I actually sympathize with. He just wants to have fun and spend some time with the ladies, and he does not want the cops, teachers or parental figures to get in the way. We all know by now that he is a star in the making, but this film confirmed his actual acting ability to me. ***",3,Fun But Should Have Been A Blast,1180224000,"05 27, 2007",2007,3193,"['can', 'sit', 'profess', 'love', 'Hitchcock', 'cerebral', 'thrillers', 'changed', 'cinema', 'forever', 'films', 'Disturbia', 'show', 'just', 'how', 'unhip', 'old', 'man', 'becoming', 'quite', 'obviously', 'Rear', 'Window', 'rip', 'off', 'hero', 'here', 'Kale', 'Shia', 'LeBeouf', 'being', 'restrained', 'premises', 'police', 'tag', 'opposed', 'broken', 'leg', 'bored', 'strange', 'neighbor', 'foul', 'play', 'head', 'Only', 'now', 'everybody', '20', 'years', 'younger', 'main', 'focus', 'keeping', 'camera', 'fixed', 'hot', 'young', 'things', 'slip', 'bathing', 'suits', 'lot', 'like', 'here', 'enjoyable', 'first', 'half', 'way', 'generic', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'really', 'only', 'tacked', 'people', 'demand', 'it.Kale', 'trouble', 'dad', 'death', 'smart', 'mouthed', 'teacher', 'cracks', 'wise', 'subsequently', 'clocked', 'cleaned', 'trouble', 'found', 'Kale', 'mother', 'thought', 'defending', 'late', 'husband', 'honor', 'was', 'less', 'important', 'protecting', 'lame', 'know-it-all', 'jaw', 'what', 'do', 'know', 'Kale', 'not', 'spending', 'house', 'arrest', 'time', 'constructively', 'implied', 'showing', 'playing', 'X-Box', 'watching', 'trash', 'TV', 'spending', 'alone', 'time', 'bathroom', '.but', 'digress', 'modern', 'amenities', 'are', 'taken', 'away', 'mother', 'leaving', 'unoccupied', 'brain', 'spy', 'neighbors', 'part', 'film', 'razor', 'sharp', 'commentary', 'suburbs', 'apparently', 'filled', 'perverted', 'little', 'boys', 'mass', 'murderers', 'darn', 'good', 'also', 'really', 'liked', 'Kale', 'interactions', 'friends', 'Ronnie', 'Ashley', 'found', 'be', 'realistically', 'centered', 'sex', 'technology', 'insults', 'will', 'however', 'have', 'forgive', 'scene', 'lifted', 'directly', 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'blonde', 'hair', 'time', 'passed', 'generally', 'good', 'mood', 'gave', 'way', 'sense', 'aggravation', 'Why', 'did', 'three', 'acts', 'have', 'be', 'carved', 'stone', 'Why', 'was', 'everything', 'so', 'predictable', 'Why', 'did', 'even', 'include', 'horror', 'aspects', 'Once', 'realized', 'everything', 'would', 'go', 'down', 'exactly', 'thought', 'would', 'positive', 'review', 'turned', 'negative', 'one.As', 'Peeping', 'Tom', 'movies', 'director', 'here', 'DJ', 'Caruso', 'felt', 'need', 'point', 'out', 'viewer', 'are', 'also', 'watchers', 'especially', 'effective', 'here', 'viewer', 'ogle', 'Ashley', 'body', 'have', 'watch', 'somewhat', 'disturbing', 'shot', 'Kale', 'doing', 'same', 'thing', ""'m"", 'sure', 'point', 'was', 'lost', 'most', 'popcorn-munchers', 'especially', 'linebacker', 'seated', 'directly', 'next', 'was', 'neat', 'touch', 'be', 'simultaneously', 'jealous', 'repulsed', 'Kale', 'hair', 'sniffing', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'Ashley', 'character', 'one', 'dimensional', 'just', 'tease', 'control', 'sexuality', 'well', 'years', 'Not', 'Kale', 'attention', 'infatuation', 'possessiveness', 'LaBeouf', 'performance', 'awesome', 'rarest', 'creations', 'Hollywood', 'character', 'actually', 'sympathize', 'just', 'have', 'fun', 'spend', 'time', 'ladies', 'not', 'want', 'cops', 'teachers', 'parental', 'figures', 'get', 'way', 'know', 'now', 'star', 'making', 'film', 'confirmed', 'actual', 'acting', 'ability', '***']",N/A

You've got pressure from your family to do well in school (that is, if you have a family that cares), you have to deal with peer pressure, bullies, and of course the worst part of growing up - raging hormones.To make things even worse, throw a tragic loss into the mix and it is nothing more than a recipe for disaster.That's what happened to the Kale Brecht (portrayed by Shia LaBeouf). In high school when he loses his father right before his eyes in a tragic car accident, he ends up retreating into himself.His marks in school suffer and after his Spanish Teacher ends up making a comment about his father, he loses his temper and hits the teacher.That ends up leading to him being charged for assault and placed under 3 months house arrest.Now, as a parent of a teenager myself, I know how tough things are. The hormones are especially difficult to deal with, and they turn even your best child into a rebellious monster.Well, not monster, but you get the picture.I know that when my kid disobeys, I punish him by taking away his privileges. And that's exactly what happened to Kale. His mother (portrayed by Carrie-Anne Moss) cuts off his I-tunes and Xbox live.And to make a point, she even cut the power cord to his television. Thus increasing the tension between the two of them.So, boredom sets in and he begins to spy on the neighbours in order to keep himself from going crazy. In a few short weeks he discovers how interesting his neighbours are - trouble makers, obsessive compulsives, even infidelity!Now, the movie is quite entertaining, with several scenes of laugh out loud humour, and even a little bit of sensuality when new neighbours move in and Kale notices the beautiful and very well built daughter. She does spend a lot of time lounging in the pool, after all.The suspense begins to build after Kale listens to reports about missing girls and suspects it's because of his one neighbour, after realizing that the car he drives matches the description of the vehicle last seen with one of the victims.With the help of his best friend Ron and the lovely girl from next door, he ends up setting of a chain of events that culminates in one very intense confrontation.Oh, and his friend Ron pulls off one hell of a practical joke - something that I'd love to do myself!So, as a teenage flick goes, I enjoyed it and found it to be worth seeing.I also took the time to watch several of the bonus features that were included on the disk. It had your typical deleted scenes, of which none really helped progress the plot, so I can see why they ended up on the cutting room floor.I did enjoy the outtakes, the second one in particular. I was disappointed though that the Serial Pursuit trivia pop up game didn't work on my disk. It kept brining me back to the main menu.The music video for the song `Don't make me wait' by This World Fair was ok.Speaking of music, I didn't really care for the soundtrack. Hey, I'm more of a heavy rocker than pop, and the music didn't really catch my interest. But as I've stated many times in the past - this is strictly my opinion, and no one else's.The DVD is worth checking out.4 out of 5",4,Not your average teen flick,1198972800,"12 30, 2007",2007,3685,"['Disturbia', 'one', 'rare', 'suspense', 'movies', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'am', 'not', 'one', 'who', 'typically', 'Teenager', 'movies', 'year', 'been', 'exception', 'First', 'Invisible', 'now', 'one.In', 'essence', 'remake', 'old', 'classic', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'movie', 'called', 'Rear', 'Window.Both', 'movies', 'have', 'several', 'themes', 'common', 'someone', 'essentially', 'trapped', 'home', 'due', 'circumstances', 'boredom', 'begin', 'spy', 'neighbours.Growing', 'up', 'difficult', 'everyone', 'remember', 'how', 'tough', 'teenage', 'years', 'were', ""'ve"", 'got', 'pressure', 'family', 'do', 'well', 'school', 'have', 'family', 'have', 'deal', 'peer', 'pressure', 'bullies', 'course', 'worst', 'part', 'growing', 'up', 'raging', 'hormones.To', 'make', 'things', 'even', 'worse', 'throw', 'tragic', 'loss', 'mix', 'nothing', 'more', 'recipe', 'disaster.That', 'what', 'happened', 'Kale', 'Brecht', 'portrayed', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'high', 'school', 'when', 'father', 'right', 'eyes', 'tragic', 'car', 'accident', 'up', 'retreating', 'himself.His', 'marks', 'school', 'suffer', 'Spanish', 'Teacher', 'up', 'making', 'comment', 'father', 'temper', 'teacher.That', 'up', 'leading', 'being', 'charged', 'assault', 'placed', '3', 'months', 'house', 'arrest.Now', 'parent', 'teenager', 'know', 'how', 'tough', 'things', 'are', 'hormones', 'are', 'especially', 'difficult', 'deal', 'turn', 'even', 'best', 'child', 'rebellious', 'monster.Well', 'not', 'monster', 'get', 'picture.I', 'know', 'when', 'kid', 'disobeys', 'punish', 'taking', 'away', 'privileges', 'exactly', 'what', 'happened', 'Kale', 'mother', 'portrayed', 'Carrie-Anne', 'Moss', 'I-tunes', 'Xbox', 'live.And', 'make', 'point', 'even', 'cut', 'power', 'cord', 'television', 'Thus', 'increasing', 'tension', 'two', 'them.So', 'boredom', 'sets', 'spy', 'neighbours', 'order', 'keep', 'going', 'crazy', 'few', 'short', 'weeks', 'how', 'interesting', 'neighbours', 'are', 'trouble', 'makers', 'obsessive', 'compulsives', 'even', 'infidelity', 'Now', 'movie', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'several', 'scenes', 'laugh', 'loud', 'humour', 'even', 'little', 'bit', 'sensuality', 'when', 'new', 'neighbours', 'move', 'Kale', 'beautiful', 'very', 'well', 'built', 'daughter', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'lounging', 'pool', 'all.The', 'suspense', 'build', 'Kale', 'reports', 'missing', 'girls', 'one', 'neighbour', 'realizing', 'car', 'description', 'vehicle', 'last', 'seen', 'one', 'victims.With', 'help', 'best', 'friend', 'Ron', 'lovely', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'up', 'setting', 'chain', 'events', 'one', 'very', 'intense', 'confrontation.Oh', 'friend', 'Ron', 'one', 'hell', 'practical', 'joke', 'something', ""'d"", 'love', 'do', 'So', 'teenage', 'flick', 'enjoyed', 'found', 'be', 'worth', 'seeing.I', 'also', 'took', 'time', 'watch', 'several', 'bonus', 'features', 'were', 'included', 'disk', 'had', 'typical', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'none', 'really', 'helped', 'progress', 'plot', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'ended', 'up', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor.I', 'did', 'enjoy', 'outtakes', 'second', 'one', 'particular', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Serial', 'Pursuit', 'trivia', 'pop', 'up', 'game', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'disk', 'kept', 'brining', 'back', 'main', 'menu.The', 'music', 'video', 'song', 'Do', ""n't"", 'make', 'wait', 'World', 'Fair', 'was', 'ok.Speaking', 'music', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'soundtrack', 'Hey', ""'m"", 'more', 'heavy', 'rocker', 'pop', 'music', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'catch', 'interest', ""'ve"", 'stated', 'many', 'times', 'past', 'strictly', 'opinion', 'one', ""else's.The"", 'DVD', 'worth', 'checking', 'out.4', '5']",N/A
1082989,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000RO6K80,"Cloud ""...""","[4, 5]","Ever watch a movie that you think will be terrible like the recent genre has been dishing out only to find it's actually...good? Well in Disturbia's case I wouldn't use the word ""good"" but considering the amount of bad horror/thriller films released lately, you're kind of surprised Disturbia's at least memorable. While it does have its flaws and spots of stupidness on some characters' part, it's fairly engaging if sort-of familiar thriller.Kale Brecht is a 17 year old kid who loses his dad a year earlier when their vehicle gets into a pretty brutal car accident. Now, he's still pretty sore and emotionally turned off which doesn't help when his Spanish teacher makes a comment about his dad, prompting Kale to hit the guy. Instead of jail, he's put under house arrest with an electronic bracelet attached to his leg which alerts the police should he leave his yard.Now completely bored since his mom cancelled his iTunes and XBox-Live, he decides to start spying on some neighbours, including new hottie Ashley. But there's someone else in the neighborhood, namely Robert Turner who Kale believes is a serial killer. With the help of Ashley, his friend Ronnie and some high-tech gadgets, Kale tries to figure out whether his neighbor really is a wanted killer.First off, it's nice to see a thriller actually develop characters and ideas rather than just go off to the races and start amping up the tension. While it doesn't really work because the characters are still one note by the end of it, you still gotta appreciate a more slower opening. But that doesn't mean the characters are exempt from dumb ideas and illogical decisions. For instance, why put a camera on a car when you want to actually film something else, and then there's smaller stuff like why be bored because your X-Box is taken away yet not hook it up to a different TV? Or keep manipulating the camera to get better views when it's already hooked up to the TV. Or why he takes so long to figure out how far the safe distance is from the bracelet receiver?The film though at least is a bit more active than its obvious spirit and homage to Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"". But whereas that film had an incapacitated James Stewart, Kale is more active and just as likable thanks to Shia Lebeouf who has that everyman quality without being that sort of too-bright-for-his-years wisdom most have. Everyone else is fine but no one particularly special. While David Morse seems the logical choice for the soft-spoken Mr. Turner, it seems like lazy casting since he's played shady characters before so there's not a lot of doubt on whether he really is the killer or not. Then we have a character, played by former Muchmusic VJ Amanda Walsh who practically disappears from the story and yet didn't contribute anything anyways. Why bother including her?It's suspenseful and its certainly better than stuff like the Texas Chainsaw prequel and Saw III but taken on its own, it's a pretty good but not exceptional thriller.",3,3.5; Better than most,1186444800,"08 7, 2007",2007,2985,"['Ever', 'watch', 'movie', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'terrible', 'recent', 'genre', 'been', 'dishing', 'only', 'find', 'actually', 'good', 'Well', 'Disturbia', 'case', 'would', ""n't"", 'use', 'word', 'good', 'considering', 'amount', 'bad', 'horror/thriller', 'films', 'released', 'lately', ""'re"", 'kind', 'surprised', 'Disturbia', 'least', 'memorable', 'have', 'flaws', 'spots', 'stupidness', 'characters', 'part', 'fairly', 'engaging', 'sort-of', 'familiar', 'thriller.Kale', 'Brecht', '17', 'year', 'old', 'kid', 'who', 'dad', 'year', 'earlier', 'when', 'vehicle', 'pretty', 'brutal', 'car', 'accident', 'Now', 'still', 'pretty', 'sore', 'emotionally', 'turned', 'off', ""n't"", 'help', 'when', 'Spanish', 'teacher', 'comment', 'dad', 'prompting', 'Kale', 'hit', 'guy', 'Instead', 'jail', 'put', 'house', 'arrest', 'electronic', 'bracelet', 'attached', 'leg', 'police', 'should', 'leave', 'yard.Now', 'completely', 'bored', 'mom', 'cancelled', 'iTunes', 'XBox-Live', 'start', 'spying', 'neighbours', 'including', 'new', 'hottie', 'Ashley', 'someone', 'else', 'neighborhood', 'namely', 'Robert', 'Turner', 'who', 'Kale', 'serial', 'killer', 'help', 'Ashley', 'friend', 'Ronnie', 'high-tech', 'gadgets', 'Kale', 'figure', 'out', 'neighbor', 'really', 'wanted', 'killer.First', 'nice', 'see', 'thriller', 'actually', 'develop', 'characters', 'ideas', 'rather', 'just', 'go', 'off', 'races', 'start', 'amping', 'up', 'tension', ""n't"", 'really', 'work', 'characters', 'are', 'still', 'one', 'note', 'end', 'still', 'got', 'ta', 'appreciate', 'more', 'slower', 'opening', ""n't"", 'mean', 'characters', 'are', 'exempt', 'dumb', 'ideas', 'illogical', 'decisions', 'instance', 'why', 'put', 'camera', 'car', 'when', 'want', 'actually', 'film', 'something', 'else', 'then', 'smaller', 'stuff', 'why', 'be', 'bored', 'X-Box', 'taken', 'away', 'yet', 'not', 'hook', 'up', 'different', 'TV', 'keep', 'manipulating', 'camera', 'get', 'better', 'views', 'when', 'already', 'hooked', 'up', 'TV', 'why', 'so', 'long', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'far', 'safe', 'distance', 'bracelet', 'receiver', 'film', 'least', 'bit', 'more', 'active', 'obvious', 'spirit', 'homage', 'Hitchcock', 'Rear', 'Window', 'film', 'had', 'incapacitated', 'James', 'Stewart', 'Kale', 'more', 'active', 'just', 'likable', 'thanks', 'Shia', 'Lebeouf', 'who', 'everyman', 'quality', 'being', 'sort', 'too-bright-for-his-years', 'wisdom', 'most', 'have', 'Everyone', 'else', 'fine', 'one', 'particularly', 'special', 'David', 'Morse', 'logical', 'choice', 'soft-spoken', 'Mr.', 'Turner', 'lazy', 'casting', 'played', 'shady', 'characters', 'not', 'lot', 'doubt', 'really', 'killer', 'not', 'Then', 'have', 'character', 'played', 'former', 'Muchmusic', 'VJ', 'Amanda', 'Walsh', 'who', 'practically', 'story', 'yet', 'did', ""n't"", 'contribute', 'anything', 'anyways', 'Why', 'bother', 'including', 'suspenseful', 'certainly', 'better', 'stuff', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'prequel', 'Saw', 'III', 'taken', 'own', 'pretty', 'good', 'not', 'exceptional', 'thriller']",N/A
1082990,A3J5UO5QMTFSWB,B000RO6K80,"Connoisseur Rat ""armchair experientialist""","[2, 3]","After losing his father in a tragic (and surprisingly graphic) car accident and subsequently slugging his Spanish teacher (in what I felt to be an understandable assault), high school senior Kale (Shia LaBeouf) finds himself under house arrest for the summer with one of those Martha Stewart-style ankle bracelets.  And if that's not bad enough, his mother (who, according to Kale, has become ""like the warden from Shawshank"") has cancelled his Xbox live and iTunes accounts in order to offset his $12/day incarceration fee, forcing him to endure what he calls ""reality without the TV"" - also known as spying on his local neighbors through his prison/mansion's multitude of windows.  Eventually, this through-the-window entertainment proves more interesting than, say, the last five seasons of Big Brother, as one of his neighbors (Sarah Roemer) turns out to be quite sexy and another (David Morse) turns out to be quite serial killer-y.  And though this voyeurism is initially a more enticing activity, it should be noted that at least the houseguests in Big Bother don't ever try to kidnap your mom or preserve you in a formaldehyde vat.  So Kale's is a risky (albeit exciting) choice of amusement, at best.Ya know, you'll read a lot of comparisons (here and elsewhere) of this movie to the Alfred Hitchcock classic ""Rear Window"", but I think this is more ""Side Window"" than ""Rear Window"" (there are a lot more windows, in any case), and Shia - though under house arrest - is decidedly more mobile than Jimmy Stewart was in the original (and either way I'll pick Grace Kelly over Sarah Roemer any day).  Ultimately, while the idea isn't necessarily new, the execution is fresh and innovative enough to make it a worthwhile retelling of a once-told tale - especially with the nifty usage of the latest technology and electro-gadgetry.I now must pause here, mid-review, to issue this public service acting announcement: dangerous serious killers aside, the biggest transgression of this film is how criminally underused Carrie-Anne Moss is in her role as Kale's mom.  Nevertheless, she - as always - elevates every scene she graces.  We now return to our regularly scheduled review:And speaking of danger and technology, it's probably dangerous to the shelf life of a film to fill it so chock full of gadget-y gimmickry at a time when such things become quickly outmoded and new inventions emerge at an increasingly rapid rate.  It'll be neat to see how much of its tech comes off as archaic in, say, five years.  Because, at the currently (heh) exponentially increasing rate of technological advancement (especially where handheld gizmos are concerned), I'm guessing that a lot of this stuff will seem as obsolete in 2012 as Matthew Broderick's 80's battles with the Joshua computer in Wargames does today (and thus the requisite YouTube shoutout at the end of the movie might be greeted with a collective feeling of nostalgia).  But for now, there's a nifty kind of ""gee whiz"" electronics element that fans of current consumer electronics will be sure to enjoy and which might be a bit off-putting for fans who were teens when the original Rear Window came out in theaters (and I suspect that, if investigated, there would be a strong correlation between one's enjoyment of current technology and one's enjoyment of this movie).",4,Are You Lookin' At Me?,1177977600,"05 1, 2007",2007,3330,"['losing', 'father', 'tragic', 'surprisingly', 'graphic', 'car', 'accident', 'subsequently', 'slugging', 'Spanish', 'teacher', 'what', 'felt', 'be', 'understandable', 'assault', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'Kale', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'house', 'arrest', 'summer', 'one', 'Martha', 'Stewart-style', 'ankle', 'bracelets', 'not', 'bad', 'enough', 'mother', 'who', 'according', 'Kale', 'become', 'warden', 'Shawshank', 'cancelled', 'Xbox', 'live', 'iTunes', 'accounts', 'order', 'offset', '12/day', 'incarceration', 'fee', 'forcing', 'endure', 'what', 'reality', 'TV', 'also', 'known', 'spying', 'local', 'neighbors', 'prison/mansion', 'multitude', 'windows', 'Eventually', 'through-the-window', 'entertainment', 'more', 'interesting', 'say', 'last', 'five', 'seasons', 'Big', 'Brother', 'one', 'neighbors', 'Sarah', 'Roemer', 'out', 'be', 'quite', 'sexy', 'David', 'Morse', 'out', 'be', 'quite', 'serial', 'killer-y', 'voyeurism', 'initially', 'more', 'enticing', 'activity', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'least', 'houseguests', 'Big', 'Bother', 'do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'try', 'kidnap', 'mom', 'preserve', 'formaldehyde', 'vat', 'So', 'Kale', 'risky', 'exciting', 'choice', 'amusement', 'best.Ya', 'know', ""'ll"", 'read', 'lot', 'comparisons', 'here', 'elsewhere', 'movie', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'classic', 'Rear', 'Window', 'think', 'more', 'Side', 'Window', 'Rear', 'Window', 'are', 'lot', 'more', 'windows', 'case', 'Shia', 'house', 'arrest', 'decidedly', 'more', 'mobile', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'was', 'original', 'way', ""'ll"", 'pick', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'Sarah', 'Roemer', 'day', 'Ultimately', 'idea', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'new', 'execution', 'fresh', 'innovative', 'enough', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'retelling', 'once-told', 'tale', 'especially', 'nifty', 'usage', 'latest', 'technology', 'electro-gadgetry.I', 'now', 'must', 'pause', 'here', 'mid-review', 'issue', 'public', 'service', 'acting', 'announcement', 'dangerous', 'serious', 'killers', 'aside', 'biggest', 'transgression', 'film', 'how', 'criminally', 'underused', 'Carrie-Anne', 'Moss', 'role', 'Kale', 'mom', 'Nevertheless', 'always', 'scene', 'now', 'return', 'regularly', 'scheduled', 'review', 'speaking', 'danger', 'technology', 'probably', 'dangerous', 'shelf', 'life', 'film', 'fill', 'so', 'chock', 'full', 'gadget-y', 'gimmickry', 'time', 'when', 'such', 'things', 'become', 'quickly', 'outmoded', 'new', 'inventions', 'emerge', 'increasingly', 'rapid', 'rate', ""'ll"", 'be', 'neat', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'tech', 'off', 'archaic', 'say', 'five', 'years', 'currently', 'heh', 'exponentially', 'increasing', 'rate', 'technological', 'advancement', 'especially', 'where', 'handheld', 'gizmos', 'are', 'concerned', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'lot', 'stuff', 'will', 'seem', 'obsolete', '2012', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', '80', 'battles', 'Joshua', 'computer', 'Wargames', 'today', 'thus', 'requisite', 'YouTube', 'shoutout', 'end', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'greeted', 'collective', 'feeling', 'nostalgia', 'now', 'nifty', 'kind', 'gee', 'whiz', 'electronics', 'element', 'fans', 'current', 'consumer', 'electronics', 'will', 'be', 'sure', 'enjoy', 'might', 'be', 'bit', 'off-putting', 'fans', 'who', 'were', 'teens', 'when', 'original', 'Rear', 'Window', 'came', 'out', 'theaters', 'suspect', 'investigated', 'would', 'be', 'strong', 'correlation', 'one', 'enjoyment', 'current', 'technology', 'one', 'enjoyment', 'movie']",N/A

Not a slight achievement.  The film opens with Daniel Brecht (Matt Craven) and his son, Kale (Shia LeBeouf) fishing and showing us their happy family life.  On the way home, things become shockingly bad.  A year later it gets worse when Kale decks a Spanish teacher who is upset at Kale's being so withdrawn.A judge sentences Kale to a summer home detention with a 100 ft radius ankle bracelet monitor.  His mother (Carrie-Ann Moss) takes away his video games and TV.  The boy is left to watching his neighbors through binoculars.  It is a Hollywood convention that if you peel back the surface of suburbia all kinds of disturbing things are going on.One of the neighbors he watches is a new move in named Ashley (Sarah Roemer).  His friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) joins the observation, and, of course, Ashley catches them and joins their little paranoid band.  They focus their attention and neighbor Mr. Turner (David Morse) who is a very private person who loves to mow his lawn.  Kale becomes convinced he is something very sinister, but his friends do not want to go down that path.The rest of the movie is about exploring those fears and allegations while being trapped within a 100 ft. radius of the monitor.  The comic relief is provided by a mischievous group of kids who live on another side of the house.  They are typically obnoxious pre and early teen boys and, what is the saying?  Oh, yeah, hijinks ensue.The movie does create a fine sense of confusion by not letting you know exactly which way it is going to go with the plot until it actually has to make a choice.  I think the culmination of events is handled quite well and everyone leaves pretty much OK.

1082993,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B000RO6K80,Cubist,"[9, 13]","With a starring role in the new Transformers film and a significant role in the upcoming Indiana Jones installment, Shia LaBeouf is being groomed as the next big thing. He made Disturbia just before these blockbusters and this little thriller was a surprise success at the box office as audiences gravitated to what critics rightly labeled Rear Window for the new Millennium.It's hard to assess LaBeouf's ability as an actor as he's not given much to work with. The script is merely serviceable with thinly-sketched characters and clich&eacute;d dialogue. Veteran actor David Morse does the best job with the material as he oozes genial, soft-spoken menace in every scene. He wisely adheres to the less-is-more school of acting. Carrie-Anne Moss gets the thankless role of the mother who has to show her delinquent son some tough love while making friends with the next-door neighbour psycho. Her bland character makes one long for her sexy freedom fighter in The Matrix films.Like David Lynch's Blue Velvet, Disturbia explores the dark underbelly that exists under the sunny facade of contemporary suburbia with LaBeouf as the amateur detective/voyeur, Morse as the evil psychopath and Sarah Roemer as the wholesome but not too wholesome girl-next-door. This film also evokes Brian De Palma's Body Double, a thriller about voyeurism and murder but unlike both of these films; it doesn't have the content or the style to separate itself from your average thriller.Director D.J. Caruso tries to keep things interesting visually but he's kept in check by a PG-13 rating, essentially making Rear Window for teens. It's a change from his usual adult fare (Taking Lives and Two for the Money) but not in a good way. Disturbia falls back on tired clich&eacute;s that we've seen a million times before, like the bad guy who feels the need to explain himself instead of killing off the hero thereby buying just enough time for the protagonist to regain the advantage. That's just sloppy, lazy screenwriting, folks.There is an audio commentary by director D.J. Caruso and actors Shia LaBeouf and Sarah Roemer. Caruso answers a call from his wife early on to take an order of stuff to pick up afterwards which kinda sets the tone for this track. I mean, c'mon! At least have the forethought to turn off your phone beforehand. It is this lack of commitment which, in turn, makes you not really care about what's being said...which ain't much in all truthfulness. Avoid at all costs.Also included are four deleted scenes that flesh out Kale's relationship with his mother and builds on the tension that exists between them.

But, then, the story-line picks up and the movie gets better.It's not a DISGUSTING movie (there's really no bloody-gore) and the end is how, in MY own personal opinion, a movie SHOULD end.

1082996,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,B000RO6K80,Dave. K,"[1, 3]","For the longest time I avoided Disturbia; it seemed nothing more than a knockoff of the Alfred Hitchcock classic Rear Window. I figured it would nothing more than a lame knockoff aimed at an audience that probably have never seen Rear Window and possibly never even heard of it. But I started hearing some decent reviews and I finally gave in.But I have to say Disturbia was the surprise movie of the year for me. I must say I quite enjoyed it. It never reaches the greatness of the movie it was inspired by, but Disturbia makes for a fun thrill ride and is one of the best thrillers to come out of Hollywood for quite sometime.The screenplay by Christopher Landon & Carl Ellsworth was actually very well written. The characters actually have depth. They weren't the typical cardboard cut out characters most of these movies seem to have. The characters are likeable and have depth. The screenplay isn't ground-breaking nor does it put any kinda twist, but the script works quite well overall.Director D.J. Caruso does a bang up job; I personally very much disliked Taking Lives, which was directed by Caruso, but I'm a big fan of The Shield, which he has directed quite a few episodes of. In TV it's more about the writing than the directing. But even with that said I was still curious to see how Caruso would fair and he really does an excellent job. The pacing is overall very good, while there might be a slow moment or two Caruso is able to keep things moving at a good pace and never lets the pace lag.The plot does start off slow; while there are little hints of things to come it's not until about the 40-minute mark when things start to pick up and once the hour mark hits Disturbia takes off. In many ways, the possible murderer plot is sort of the subplot, which I found quite interesting. Most of the movie really deals with Kale played by Shia LaBeouf and how he deals with being under house arrest.All the actors are pretty good as well; none of the performances are Iconic or anything, but all the actors do a solid job and are quite believable. David Morse was the stand-out though; he plays the role to near perfection. He's a very good and much underrated actor.Disturbia is predictable there is nothing here we haven't seen before. It follows the basic format of this genre, but it still makes for a fun time. Unless you haven't seen many movies you should be able to tell how the movie will play out from beginning to end, but if the movie is well written and well made it's easy to look past that and Disturbia is well written and well made and again makes for a really fun time. Disturbia will obviously play best with the teen crowd, but it's still a movie anyone can really enjoy.In closing, what Disturbia lacks in originality it makes up for in the shear fun of it. A lot of PG-13 movies are very much toned down and treat the viewers like idiots and a lot of R-Rated flicks rely on shock value. So it's good to see a movie like Disturbia that isn't toned down and doesn't treat the viewer like an idiot, but relies on story-telling and suspense.",4,The surprise movie of the year,1194825600,"11 12, 2007",2007,3073,"['longest', 'time', 'avoided', 'Disturbia', 'seemed', 'nothing', 'more', 'knockoff', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'classic', 'Rear', 'Window', 'figured', 'would', 'nothing', 'more', 'lame', 'knockoff', 'aimed', 'audience', 'probably', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Rear', 'Window', 'possibly', 'never', 'even', 'heard', 'started', 'hearing', 'decent', 'reviews', 'finally', 'gave', 'in.But', 'have', 'say', 'Disturbia', 'was', 'surprise', 'movie', 'year', 'must', 'say', 'quite', 'enjoyed', 'never', 'greatness', 'movie', 'was', 'inspired', 'Disturbia', 'fun', 'thrill', 'ride', 'one', 'best', 'thrillers', 'come', 'Hollywood', 'quite', 'sometime.The', 'screenplay', 'Christopher', 'Landon', 'Carl', 'Ellsworth', 'was', 'actually', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'characters', 'actually', 'have', 'depth', 'were', ""n't"", 'typical', 'cardboard', 'cut', 'out', 'characters', 'most', 'movies', 'seem', 'have', 'characters', 'are', 'likeable', 'have', 'depth', 'screenplay', ""n't"", 'ground-breaking', 'put', 'kinda', 'twist', 'script', 'quite', 'well', 'overall.Director', 'D.J', 'Caruso', 'bang', 'up', 'job', 'personally', 'very', 'much', 'disliked', 'Taking', 'Lives', 'was', 'directed', 'Caruso', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'Shield', 'directed', 'quite', 'few', 'episodes', 'TV', 'more', 'writing', 'directing', 'even', 'said', 'was', 'still', 'curious', 'see', 'how', 'Caruso', 'would', 'fair', 'really', 'excellent', 'job', 'pacing', 'overall', 'very', 'good', 'might', 'be', 'slow', 'moment', 'two', 'Caruso', 'able', 'keep', 'things', 'moving', 'good', 'pace', 'never', 'pace', 'lag.The', 'plot', 'start', 'off', 'slow', 'are', 'little', 'hints', 'things', 'come', 'not', '40-minute', 'mark', 'when', 'things', 'start', 'pick', 'up', 'once', 'hour', 'mark', 'Disturbia', 'off', 'many', 'ways', 'possible', 'murderer', 'plot', 'sort', 'subplot', 'found', 'quite', 'interesting', 'Most', 'movie', 'really', 'Kale', 'played', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'how', 'being', 'house', 'actors', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'well', 'none', 'performances', 'are', 'Iconic', 'anything', 'actors', 'do', 'solid', 'job', 'are', 'quite', 'believable', 'David', 'Morse', 'was', 'stand-out', 'though', 'role', 'perfection', 'very', 'good', 'much', 'underrated', 'actor.Disturbia', 'predictable', 'nothing', 'here', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'basic', 'format', 'genre', 'still', 'fun', 'time', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'many', 'movies', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'tell', 'how', 'movie', 'will', 'play', 'out', 'beginning', 'end', 'movie', 'well', 'written', 'well', 'made', 'easy', 'look', 'Disturbia', 'well', 'written', 'well', 'made', 'again', 'really', 'fun', 'time', 'Disturbia', 'will', 'obviously', 'play', 'best', 'teen', 'crowd', 'still', 'movie', 'anyone', 'can', 'really', 'enjoy.In', 'closing', 'what', 'Disturbia', 'originality', 'up', 'shear', 'fun', 'lot', 'PG-13', 'movies', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'toned', 'down', 'treat', 'viewers', 'idiots', 'lot', 'R-Rated', 'flicks', 'rely', 'shock', 'value', 'good', 'see', 'movie', 'Disturbia', ""n't"", 'toned', 'down', ""n't"", 'treat', 'viewer', 'idiot', 'relies', 'story-telling', 'suspense']",N/A

The most emotionally intense moments occurred during the opening sequence, but it was still a very engaging film. A nice balance of humor, drama and thrills.The mystery builds nicely as the main character, Kale (Shia LaBeouf), passes his time during house arrest by spying on the neighbors. He develops a love interest with an attractive girl next door (Sarah Roemer), and connects his other neighbor, Mr. Turner (David Morse), with a running news story about a serial killer from Texas. The girl and Kale's friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) join him in investigating the mystery, putting the clues together, and staking out the mysterious neighbor.They go as far as to monitor his stop at a department store while Ron breaks into the Turner's car to retrieve the code on the garage door opener so they can later gain access to the house and check the contents of a bag, which Kale suspects contains the remains of one of Turner's victims.The suspense escalates as we learn the sinister truth behind Mr. Turner's activities. Kale inadvertently breaks the boundaries of the tracking device strapped to his leg, and as a result the cops just consider him a trouble maker, with too much time on his hands. It's almost too late when they realize that he is telling the truth about his neighbor's hidden evil.In all a great film, decent acting and comic relief, especially from the quirky, energetic Ron. His endearing antics and personality make the film that much more entertaining. Veteran actor David Morse serves up a creepy yet subdued and charming performance which belies the darkness at the heart of his character.Shia LaBeouf brings a likeable John Cusack style to his character, and Sarah Roemer is incredibly alluring. The only thing that seemed flat about this film was the presence of Kale's mother. Her character isn't established enoughfor us  to be too concerned for her. Personally I was more concerned with the well being of Ron, Kale and the girl. The film works, but I felt the mother was the weakest character.

1083002,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000RO6K80,Ed Uyeshima,"[4, 5]","First things first, the only similarity this 2007 movie has with Alfred Hitchcock's classic voyeuristic thriller, 1954'sRear Window, is the basic concept of a temporarily immobile protagonist who sees highly suspicious activity from a distance only to find he may be endangered by what he may have witnessed. Other than the central plot device, the comparison falls apart since director D.J. Caruso (The Salton Sea) seems intent on making a teen-oriented thrill ride driven by angst and hormones. The focal point is teenaged Kale Brecht who has to spend his summer under police surveillance through a motion-detection ankle bracelet. The laborious set-up for this situation takes a good half-hour, though this is likely the best part of the film as it begins with a car crash visceral in impact and impressive in technical execution.Reeling from the tragic results of the accident, Kale punches his Spanish teacher in the face, for which the bracelet is his punishment. Increasingly bored and incorrigible, he has his electronic toys taken away by his exasperated mother, leaving him nothing to do but watch his neighbors with binoculars. Two figures new to the neighborhood come into focus - Ashley, a comely neighbor who becomes Kale's object of pubescent desire, and Mr. Turner, a taciturn bachelor whose suspicious behavior peaks Kale's interest and imagination. What happens next is unfortunately predictable and downright lazy, as screenwriters Carl Ellsworth and Christopher B. Landon eschew much of the psychological elements of the supposedly tense situation in favor of overly familiar, crowd-pleasing scare tactics.The violent, drawn-out finale is beyond absurd and further saddled by the restrictions of the film's PG-13 rating. In a role almost identical to the one he plays inTransformers, Shia LaBeouf brings energy and at times surprising gravity to Kale though not enough to compensate for the script's shortcomings. Sarah Roemer, looking like a cross between Kate Hudson and Jessica Biel, plays Ashley as a stockLolitafigure at least until she is called on conveniently to become resourceful. Even though he has the funniest lines, Aaron Yoo's role as goofball best pal Ronnie is poorly conceived to fit the plot machinations, and bereft of herMatrixcoolness factor, Carrie-Anne Moss seems ill-used as Kale's put-upon mother. With his soft voice and unshakable manner, David Morse looks like he is having a good time playing Turner, but the character's revelations toward the end unravel any momentum of fear he was able to muster before.The 2007 DVD has the standard set of extras with the most prominent being a rather flat, undisciplined commentary track from Caruso, LaBeouf and Roemer and a marginally better fifteen-minute making-of featurette. ""The Making of Disturbia"". There are four deleted scenes, all serving to deepen the relationship between Kale and his mother, and a few outtakes, mostly around the opening fishing sequence. Also included is the theatrical trailer, a pop-up quiz that is really a series of pop-up bubbles and a Caruso-directed music video of ""Don't Make Me Wait"" by This World Fair.",2,Teen-Oriented Voyeuristic Tale Unravels Hitchcock's Inspiration in Favor of Cheap Scares,1188777600,"09 3, 2007",2007,3133,"['First', 'things', 'first', 'only', 'similarity', '2007', 'movie', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'classic', 'voyeuristic', 'thriller', ""1954'sRear"", 'Window', 'basic', 'concept', 'temporarily', 'immobile', 'protagonist', 'who', 'highly', 'suspicious', 'activity', 'distance', 'only', 'find', 'may', 'be', 'endangered', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'witnessed', 'Other', 'central', 'plot', 'device', 'comparison', 'apart', 'director', 'D.J', 'Caruso', 'Salton', 'Sea', 'intent', 'making', 'teen-oriented', 'thrill', 'ride', 'driven', 'angst', 'hormones', 'focal', 'point', 'teenaged', 'Kale', 'Brecht', 'who', 'spend', 'summer', 'police', 'surveillance', 'motion-detection', 'ankle', 'bracelet', 'laborious', 'set-up', 'situation', 'good', 'half-hour', 'likely', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'car', 'crash', 'visceral', 'impact', 'impressive', 'technical', 'execution.Reeling', 'tragic', 'results', 'accident', 'Kale', 'Spanish', 'teacher', 'face', 'bracelet', 'punishment', 'Increasingly', 'bored', 'incorrigible', 'electronic', 'toys', 'taken', 'away', 'exasperated', 'mother', 'leaving', 'nothing', 'do', 'watch', 'neighbors', 'binoculars', 'Two', 'figures', 'new', 'neighborhood', 'come', 'focus', 'Ashley', 'comely', 'neighbor', 'who', 'Kale', 'object', 'pubescent', 'desire', 'Mr.', 'Turner', 'taciturn', 'bachelor', 'suspicious', 'behavior', 'peaks', 'Kale', 'interest', 'imagination', 'What', 'next', 'unfortunately', 'predictable', 'downright', 'lazy', 'screenwriters', 'Carl', 'Ellsworth', 'Christopher', 'B.', 'Landon', 'eschew', 'much', 'psychological', 'elements', 'supposedly', 'tense', 'situation', 'favor', 'overly', 'familiar', 'crowd-pleasing', 'scare', 'tactics.The', 'violent', 'drawn-out', 'finale', 'absurd', 'further', 'saddled', 'restrictions', 'film', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'role', 'almost', 'identical', 'one', 'inTransformers', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'energy', 'times', 'surprising', 'gravity', 'Kale', 'not', 'enough', 'compensate', 'script', 'shortcomings', 'Sarah', 'Roemer', 'looking', 'cross', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'Ashley', 'stockLolitafigure', 'least', 'called', 'conveniently', 'become', 'resourceful', 'Even', 'funniest', 'lines', 'Aaron', 'Yoo', 'role', 'goofball', 'best', 'pal', 'Ronnie', 'poorly', 'conceived', 'fit', 'plot', 'machinations', 'bereft', 'herMatrixcoolness', 'factor', 'Carrie-Anne', 'Moss', 'ill-used', 'Kale', 'put-upon', 'mother', 'soft', 'voice', 'unshakable', 'manner', 'David', 'Morse', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'playing', 'Turner', 'character', 'revelations', 'end', 'unravel', 'momentum', 'fear', 'was', 'able', 'muster', 'before.The', '2007', 'DVD', 'standard', 'set', 'extras', 'most', 'prominent', 'being', 'rather', 'flat', 'undisciplined', 'commentary', 'track', 'Caruso', 'LaBeouf', 'Roemer', 'marginally', 'better', 'fifteen-minute', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'Making', 'Disturbia', 'are', 'four', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'serving', 'deepen', 'relationship', 'Kale', 'mother', 'few', 'outtakes', 'mostly', 'opening', 'fishing', 'sequence', 'Also', 'included', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'pop-up', 'quiz', 'really', 'series', 'pop-up', 'bubbles', 'Caruso-directed', 'music', 'video', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Make', 'Me', 'Wait', 'World', 'Fair']",N/A

When I first watched it in the theaters I was enamored over Shia LaBeouf's performance. He seemed natural, and he didn't seem like he was playing any other part but himself which was a perfect fit for me. He has found his niche early and will most likely stick with it for a while. The natural triad of young characters definitely personifies the typical high schooler in summer vacation in the suburbs. It fits well, to say the very least.The story itself focuses around the triad of teenagers, Kale, Ronnie, and Ashley. After Kale gets put under house arrest he spends his time stalking, or spying, on the neighbors, finding out everything about their lives. He starts to recognize the signs of a killer in his neighbor Robert Turner. The trio set to work trying to prove this as true but are often preoccupied by other ""more important"" teenage things. Mixing humor with drama, romance, and horror gives this movie a certain appeal to any kind of watcher.The serial killer himself, Robert Turner, is played by David Morse. He has a very Hannibal Lecter, Anthony Hopkins, look to him. He's polite, dresses nicely, is always presentable, and yet he's a sociopath. He has this sexually disturbing aura to him and we know from the get-go that he is the killer, beyond any shadow of a doubt. His first lines address a rabbit stuck in a trap in his garden and it gives us the thought that perhaps this is how he speaks to his victims.The final scene is short, but chilling. Reminding us of Buffalo Bill's basement, only in modern day suburbia. Hidden walls and additions to homes, walls of dirt with rickety floorboards that hold bodies. It certainly causes one's flesh to crawl.The movie's drama need some help since it is oftentimes melodramatic but it is well put together and has a nice flow of events.

1083012,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000RO6K80,Grady Harp,"[1, 4]","DISTURBIA  is a fine little thriller of a movie. Though some viewers are commenting that it is merely a takeoff on REAR WINDOW and finding it not up to that caliber - and if that bothers potential viewers then be advised, for this viewer it is more a film that addresses our progressive invasion of privacy by high tech instruments, and as such the film makes an important statement.  Writers Christopher Landon and Carl Ellsworth have produced a solid script that manages to capture teenage angst and view of the world and with director D.J. Caruso the story is propelled along with a hold-your-breath pace that makes for a very entertaining and scary movie!Kale (a very fine Shia LaBeouf) had  a great relationship with his father (Matt Craven), but in a hideous auto accident Kale witnesses the death of his father, an event that disturbs him so greatly even a year later that he misbehaves in school and eventually is put under house arrest wearing an alarm bracelet on his ankle.  Kale's mother (Carrie-Anne Moss) tries to cope with the 'incarcerated' Kale, but tires of his aimless wasting of time and energy. Out of boredom Kale stares out his windows with binoculars, observing the neighbors, not the least of which is an attractive young Ashley (Sarah Roemer). Kale's best friend  Ronnie (a very promising Aaron Yoo) is Kale's only contact with the outside world and when the two boys spy on Ashley in her swimming pool, they together find more sophisticated means of voyeurism.  And, once Ashley visits Kale the three join in spying on a strange neighbor Mr. Turner (David Morse), finding him similar to a media-described serial killer.  From there the plot thickens and quickens as the threesome made dangerous discoveries and end up in an investigation of scary proportions.The final fifteen minutes of the film are a bit over-the-top, but the rest of the movie is so well done that the ending can be forgiven.  There are some fine cameo roles by Viola Davis as the detective in charge of Kale's house arrest,  Jose Pablo Cantillo as officer who is stuck with responding to Kale's multiple infringements of his house arrest, among others.

1083014,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000RO6K80,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 1]","One year after the death of his father, Kale Brecht (Shia LaBoeuf) is placed under a 3 month house arrest after striking his school teacher. Languishing at home, Kale soon begins to go stir crazy. Falling prey to the ""natural side effects of chronic boredom,"" he constructs an edifice of Twinkies, converts his room into a kingdom of trash, and resorts to the always fun but slightly grimy diversion of spying on his neighbors. This latter activity reaches its most rewarding pinnacle when rebellious superbabe Ashley (Sarah Roemer) moves in next door. Before long, however, things take a turn for the sinister as Kale begins to believe that his other neighbor, the quiet Mr. Turner (David Morse), just might be a kidnapper and a serial killer.Shia LaBeouf, the star of this picture, is on some kind of a hot streak and is probably the busiest young actor around these days. I thought he was good inThe Greatest Game Ever Playedand provided the humanizing element inTransformers (Two-Disc Special Edition). But, in between those two films, he also starred in DISTURBIA, a well-made teenage Peeping Tom thriller which gradually unfolds its mystery even as it heightens the tension.Not to say that this film belongs in the same rarified air inhabited by classic Hitchcock films, but DISTURBIA does pilfer from the master in two senses. One, of course, is the premise it borrows directly fromRear Window (Collector's Edition). The other is the construction of the film's narrative. What did Hitchcock say? ""There is no terror in a bang; only in the anticipation of it."" SUBURBIA is an exercise in suspense building. Unlike some of the more generic and slapdash thrillers which instantly show their explicit and gory hands, this one takes its time to get to the graphic blood-curling. It lulls you with its pace and rhythm; it sets you up and makes you susceptible to the whims of your imagination.There's an investment in Kale's character. Time is granted for the audience to get to know him and sympathize with his loss, frustration, and pain and with his sense of entrapment and displacement. In fact, the plot takes a side trip into John Hughes country when next door dream Ashley is introduced. Enter teen angst and teen hormones and teen dilemmas. But then Ashley also ends up providing the impetus for Kale to seriously poke his nose into the goings-on surrounding the mysterious Mr. Turner.When things start to happen, they're initially insignificant and unremarkable. There is momentary news on the telly of a woman's kidnapping. Then a dented Mustang rolls up coinciding with the vehicle description on the news. A neighbor's late night date takes a turn for the worse. Something icky is dragged down the stairs. And, gradually, niggling suspicions begin to seep into Kale's mind.The cast, it's a fine one. David Morse is damn good at playing villains and brilliant at exuding bad vibes. Whenever I watch him in these kind of roles, I'm unsure of him. I never quite know what he's up to. There are two scenes with Morse which stand out for me: one in Kale's house wherein Mr. Turner meets Kale face to face for the first time, another in which Mr. Turner creepily terrorizes Ashley in her car. Both scenes pulsate with a quiet, terrible menace as projected by David Morse. Lovely Carrie-Anne Moss plays Kale's mother and I could wish that she were on the screen more, but, in retrospect, the film's not really about her anyway. But, still. Sarah Roemer, who should probably start doing other stuff than horror/thriller flicks soon, has got that sexy Jessica Biel thing going on, in looks and in screen persona. There's a bit of wildness in her Ashley which quickly devastates Kale and every other male in the vicinity.The film's success depends hugely on Shia LaBoeuf, and I think he pulls it off. The things that happen, the things which his character ends up doing - LaBoeuf is such a natural actor that you buy into what Kale is thinking and feeling so that when he ends up pulling those crazy stunts, well, you're with him. Shia effortlessly carries the film.The special features are plentiful but nondescript: a film commentary by the director and cast members LaBeouf and Roemer; 4 deleted scenes totalling 4 and a half minutes (three of which focus on Carrie-Anne Moss's character); the ""Making Of"" featurette (15 minutes long, it also mentions how Morse deliberately didn't speak to Shia for the first few months of shooting - ahh, method acting); a Serial Pursuit Trivia Pop-Up Quiz; Gag reel (kind of lame, especially the fishing outtakes); the music video: ""Don't Make Me Wait"" by This World Fair; a photo gallery; and the theatrical trailer.It's been a while since I've experienced a thoughtful, well-executed teen thriller. I might have to go all the way back toScream (Dimension Collector's Series). DISTURBIA is head and shoulders above the shabby likes of the recent WHEN A STRANGER CALLS and BLACK CHRISTMAS remakes. DISTURBIA, with its measured tempo, sneaks up on you. You get suckered into watching these kids at play with their seemingly harmless adventure as they get spooked a little along the way, but with, really, nothing concretely nefarious surfacing. Morse's character provides occasionally chilling moments, but still you're not quite sure if he's the killer or a red herring. That is, until the last 20 minutes or so, after which all hell breaks loose. DISTURBIA hits you up with a little romance, a bit of humor, a security ankle bracelet as a key plot device, several nerve-wracking moments, a game of cat and mouse, and a touch of serial killing. And I did enjoy how Kale finally got even with his bratty tormentors.",4,"""Operation Stupid is officially over.""",1191888000,"10 9, 2007",2007,5656,"['One', 'year', 'death', 'father', 'Kale',

After one of his teachers makes a stinging remark regarding his father, Kale punches him and ends up spending the summer in house arrest.  He becomes bored and decides to start spying on his neighbors.One of his neighbors appears to fit the description of a serial killer they are tracking on the news.  As Kale keeps on eye on him, Kale grows more and more convinced that the neighbor is the man that everybody is looking for.There are two good things I can say about this movie.  The first is the acting skills of Shia LaBeouf who just shines in any scene he is in.  He is convincing and passionate throughout this entire movie and further proves what a first class actor he is.  The acting by the others are pretty good, but the other teenagers can be a little over-the-top at times.The other thing is the last twenty minutes of the film as everything comes to its climax.  Wow!! I was literally on the edge of my seat the entire time.  It is well worth sitting through the first hour of this movie in order to get there.Which leads me to the negative aspect of this movie, which is the first hour and change of this movie.

After seeing the remake of Psycho a few years ago, I came to the conclusion that because the movies were made so well, and you know the outcome of the movie it's probably better to just leave these movies alone and move on to something more original.But Disturbia has changed my mind on this.  Disturbia is a modern retelling of Rear Window, and is honestly a good movie.  It gives you just enough of the old Rear Window to keep the connection, but introduces a whole host of new plot twists that keep you guessing.  On the whole It's not as good as rear window, but It would be really difficult for it to be considered in the same area of greatness.Here's why I liked it:1. The Actors are GREAT!  Shia LaBeouf is great!!! This kid seems to be catching a lot of breaks in some very popular movies lately, but he's only getting those roles, because he is such a good actor, and this movie is a great example of that.  Also Carrie-Ann Moss was good in the movie as well.

Almost everyone agrees with the absurdity of the whole-killer-gone-mad-in-his-secret-dungeon at the end. The scene when Shia's character realises that his mother is going in the killer's house just as he's watching the picture of a corpse in a video shot earlier in that same killer's house, well that scene could've been the start of a great psychological finale. After all, nobody would've cared what shia's character thought anymore. The police wouldn't have come a second time or at least, they would've taken their time. He would've been alone. And you manage something where his video goes kapout! And he doesn't have a proof anymore. His mother is in the house of a killer. Only HE knows it but nobody believes him... Something like that. Instead, they just went crazy with that ridiculous killer-gone-mad thing. very sad.And the whole intro with the father is COMPLETLY USELESS! A waste of time, a waste of money and we learn nothing that we wouldn't have understand later on, everytime Shia's character goes in his father's office. Plus, it goes against the rythm of the film.

They almost died and he saw his mother being almost killed! Still, he finds the strenght to laugh and joke and wink? Like nothing happened? And if he gets the girl at the end, it then means that this whole nightmare was the best thing that's ever happened in their life, no?

It may not be original (which has been pointed out endlessly) but at least it offers a good time. I believe D.J. Caruso did a nice job behind the camera. He took about fifty minutes to build the story up and develop the characters before releasing the suspense. There was plenty of suspense in the last thirty minutes or so in the movie and it was more than just ""gotcha"" scares but actual suspense which really made the film enjoyable. The viewer really gets behind the main character so don't be surprised if you find yourself rooting out loud for Kale's survival.The writing was also decent even if most of it felt a bit recycled. There were many plot points that were easy to figure out but this didn't damage the movie too much. Some of the dialog was really annoying though like the ""You can't have a stakeout without coffee and doughnuts"" line but while the lines were very corny, they were only a minor problem therefore not too damaging to the film. Also, for those expecting something likeRed Eye (Widescreen Edition)orCellular (New Line Platinum Series), look elsewhere. Those films really had the suspense going the entire film while Disturbia really only has a shocking beginning followed by forty minutes of character and story development. I'm not saying the film was boring, just not very suspenseful during those forty minutes or so. After that, Disturbia did get very exciting and it was fun to watch.Shia LaBeouf was shockingly good as Kale. Generally, I think he's an okay actor all yet he was actually pretty convincing here along with Transformers . If he had a given a weak performance then the film would have failed but he was able to give a charismatic performance and he was entertaining to watch. David Morse was effectively creepy as Mr. Turner. His subtleness really crept me out and he was very convincing. Carrie Anne-Moss was decent and it was nice to see her again on screen. Sarah Roemer looked really nice and she was also decent although a bit on the bland side. You will either like or hate Aaron Yoo's performance. Either you will find him really annoying and unbearable or you will think he's actually pretty funny. I thought he played a good supporting character and he was also fun to watch.

His mom makes sure it's not a vacation by taking away his video games and tv. He learns to entertain himself by watching the neighbors. His hot new neighbor Ashley (Sarah Roemer)  has a feeling he's watching her but chooses to join in and spy on a neighbor that Kale thinks might be the neighborhood woman snatcher. David Morse (16 Blocks) plays that neighbor perfectly since he never plays it as if Kale might actually be wrong about him. He's pretty weird and creepy and doesn't try to get us to like him.The movie reminds me of other movies such as Rear Window and even Monster House. Rear Window with of course a man stuck in his house with nothing better to do but spy on neighbors. But Monster House with how the 2 friends are watching a house nextdoor and the girl they both think is cute comes over and becomes their friend. That happens here too when Kale and his good friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) are caught watching Ashley.Despite some familiar things like that, I still got roped into this movie. It's a fun nail biter LaBeouf does a really good job carrying the movie. Plus his scenes wih girls are surprisingly good. He had chemestry with Megan Fox in Transformers and he has chemestry with Sarah Roemer here as well. So I didn't really mind that the first half is sorta slow with them getting to know each other.

In spite of a court ruling otherwise, it's so similar to Alfred Hitchcock's classic thriller, Rear Window, that it reeks of being a shameless remake using high school teens and a different premise to confine the protagonist to his room with little to do but spy on the neighbors. It's obvious the low levels of profane language, graphic violence portrayed, and mild sexual content were deliberate to get an MPAA PG-13. It allows marketing to include targeting the Jr. high and high school freshman/sophomore demographic. Horror film aficionados accustomed to the more typical &#34;R&#34; rated movies in the genre may find it tame as a result. In spite of this, its pace keeps moving without bogging down, with a good level of action and builds suspense well, maintaining it until the end, even if the general outcome is fairly predictable to maintain its appeal to a wider audience demographic.Blu-ray transfer is very good, including the excellent audio -- to be expected for a 2007 film. Extras include a &#34;making the film&#34; featurette, deleted scenes and a few outtakes, plus a music video. I would give it 3-1/2 stars if possible and primary reason for the downgrade is its excessively strong similarity to Hitchcock's Rear Window when the story could -- and should -- have been more original.

Shia LaBeouf was tremendous here. I have heard the buzz about him, but this is the first movie I have seen of his. He is going to be a huge star. He gives a knock-out performance here, and has a very likable presence, and very handsome in a non-typical Hollywood way. He gives both emotionally and physically to this role. Playing the main character, in house arrest, as he and his friends try to put the puzzle together, LaBeouf and his co-stars Dominic Daniel and Aaron Yoo have great chemistry here.

At one point, he got up and *ran* out of the theater, causing his three friends no small embarrassment. His reactions were almost more entertaining than the movie. I can't imagine this poor kid sitting through something meant to be truly frightening. I gave myself a giggle or two imagining him sliding to the popcorn-and-Coke-caked floors during the urination scene fromThe Exorcistwhile sucking his thumb and humming nursery rhymes. Poor guy.Speaking of other films, this one bore more than a passing resemblance toRear Window. I was also reminded ofThe Blair Witch Project(this may just be me - but if you see it, think of this toward the end of the film when a certain someone was walking around another certain someone's basement).Caruso didn't do a bad job with Disturbia, but he didn't ""do Hitchcock proud"". He was very fortunate to have Shia LaBeouf in the lead role. LaBeouf didn't bring James Stewart to mind, but he did make me forget from time to time that I was watching a dumbed down, high-tech Rear Window. As many have said, LaBeouf does have tremendous talent, and seems headed for stardom (despite Dumb and Dumberer).The story is fairly simple. Kale (LaBeouf) is put under house arrest for punching his Spanish teacher - although truth be told, if the Spanish teacher had thrown my dead father in my face I might have punched him too. Too coincidentally, the police officer assigned (or who assigns himself) to keep an eye on Kale is the Spanish teacher's cousin, and his treatment of Kale leaves a bit to be desired.Stuck alone in a beautiful house, after his Mom has taken away his iTunes, Xbox, and flat screen TV, Kale turns to the only form of entertainment left to him - spying on the lives of others. There is one such ""other"" who particularly intrigues him: his new next door neighbor, Ashley (Sarah Roemer), who does a swimsuit proud. Kale and his (requisite) silly friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) take turns with the binoculars enjoying her presence until she catches them at it one day (I'm not giving anything away here because it's in the trailers for the film). As reason would indicate, she then befriends them.Kale becomes suspicious of his next door neighbor, and is certain that he is the person responsible for a rash of missing women. The ensuing cat and mouse game between them is made more enjoyable by the gadgets that LaBeouf's character has that James Stewart's didn't, but the next door neighbor, ""Mr. Turner"" (David Morse, who with much shorter hair played a very convincing cop with a grudge against Greg House earlier this season in House), wasn't as, well, icky as I would have liked him to be. He's foreboding, and formidable, but a serial killer needs an ""ick factor"".

Perhaps it uses things that are not new, but with an excellent cast, chilling moments and strong storytelling, everything else works like a dream. Disturbia is about a boy who cannot legally leave his house, but believes the neighbor next door is a serial killer and with the help of his friends, he gets to investigate this individual. This is without a doubt, one of the best horror films of the year.Story:Wrathful boy Kale (Shia LaBeouf) is a high school student who lives his life as a renegade. He lost his father in a freak car accident--in a way he blames himself for this tragedy. A year passes by and now our boy is in a Spanish class where suddenly he punches his teacher for making a comment about his father. After committing this crime, he is sentenced to house arrest. A small alarm is attached to his leg, so if he leaves the perimeters of his house, the police will come. His mother Julie (Carrie-Anne Moss) is tired of Kale's behavior and accepts the punishment.What is there to do for Kale? He cannot access the internet and he cannot leave his backyard. Suddenly a brand new world is wide open outside his window. He gets to observe people around the neighborhood. Things neighbors do are very interesting for Kale. Even a new girl just moved in. She becomes the focus of attention to Kale and falls for her. This quite neighborhood is about to change. Mr Turner (David Morse) lives next door, but he hides a secret that soon our young friend is about to find out.Review:Probably inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window. Disturbia is without a doubt, one of the best thrillers of 2007. The beginning might be slow for many, but this is because director D.J. Caruso wants to build Kale's character and he does a hell of a good job. He makes us care for Kale. We get to understand why he behaves the way he does, but his worried mother tries to reach out to him without success. He prefers to hang out with his friend Ronnie--Kale shows him things that go on around the neighborhood. Things get pretty interesting when he meets the girl next door Ashley. Kale loves to watch her in a very voyeur way. The suspense builds up once Mr. Turner is in the picture. At first we get some ""false alarms"" about his persona, but little by little, a new world of terror appears right in from of them.Disturbia, besides the excellent plot and good acting, has moments full of suspense.

1083048,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B000RO6K80,Kevin Killian,"[1, 2]","When the main character's called ""Brecht"" you know the screenwriter likes to play games, and that's just what a good thriller needs.  And when his first name is ""Kale"" you know he's playing with the resemblance of adorable teen star Shia Labeouf to a particular hearty and nutritious leafy green vegetable.  This picture puts him over the top and shows, as well, he has a lot of spark with the attractive newcomer Sarah Roemer and I hope the two of them go on to make other films together.  Many have noticed Roemer's resemblance to Jessica Biel but in some moments, when the camera lingers on her a beat too long, her slack-jawed vacancy impresses with its aura of the early Larry Clark edition of Chloe Sevigny.  Anyhow the two of them are believable as boy and girl lovers, though nothing else in the movie makes a lick of sense.Didn't you think that the first violent death (within the first few minutes of the movie) would somehow find its way back into the thread of the plot?  I thought for sure it would turn out that the evil serial killer would have somehow engineered this first murder in order to a) well, he's evil incarnate but also b) so he could lure Shia (and his mother, Carrie-Anne Moss) into his labyrinth of terror.So when that didn't happen I felt a bit cheated; how about you?  Okay, so the killer has come to Disturbia within the past few years, after a previous spate of carnage in Texas, right?  How did it happen that he has created the world's largest and most multi-roomed torture chamber?  It is bigger than the Ritz-Carlton and has more theme rooms than my old standby, Plato's Retreat.  Surely this would have entailed a construction project on the scale of building Hoover Dam, and yet not one person noticed?  I hope I'm not giving away any spoilers, but within the first few minutes of the picture, as soon as you spot David Morse mowing the lawn, you know you're in the presence of Satan on legs.

What it is, though, is a fun popcorn yarn about a teen named Kale (Shia LeBeouf) who's placed under house arrest for taking out a little internal anguish on a Spanish teacher.  His mother (Carrie-Anne Moss) takes away his television, his music and his X-box.  What's a bored teen living in suburbia to do to pass the time?  Spy on the neighbors, of course.  It helps that his newest neighbor, Ashley (Sarah Roemer), is a knockout and takes regularly scheduled swims and rooftop reading breaks.  Once he has all of his neighbors' daily lives timed perfectly, he introduces his friend, Ronnie (Aaron Yoo), to his voyeuristic world.  The duo gets caught spying on Ashley but she ends up befriending them when they tell her that they believe one particular neighbor, Mr. Turner (the underused David Morse), might be a serial killer from Texas who was never captured.This sets the film into motion.  The three friends try to uncover the truth about their very private neighbor.  The only problem is that with each clue they find that might lead to the truth, Turner seems to be one step ahead of them.  Things get even crazier when the police think that Kale is crying wolf over everything.What I really enjoyed about this film is that it's very funny.  I'm not talking about it being funny in a sophomoric, slasher movie way, there's some very smart humor here.  Director D.J. Caruso keeps the humor spread just thin enough to keep the suspense at an acceptable level.  The cast is very likeable.  LeBeouf has an ever-present goofiness about him, but when he needs to be afraid or angry, he pulls it off perfectly.  Morse is sneaky and sinister at the same time.  Whether he's a murderer or not, the guy will creep you out.  Moss is solid, but has a very small role to fill.  LeBeouf's pals do a good job as well.The DVD doesn't have much to offer outside of the film that's worth more than one look.  There's the standard ""Making Of"" featurette, outtakes, a forgettable music video, deleted scenes, and a photo gallery.  The digital transfer is good, and the audio is nice as well.Overall, ""Disturbia"" is a very fun suspense flick.  It's not Hitchcock-caliber, but then again, so few films are.  If you want Hitchcock, don't watch ""Disturbia.""  If you want a good film to watch for a quiet evening at home, this film's the one for you.",4,"Entertaining, Lightly Suspenseful Thriller",1188604800,"09 1, 2007",2007,2397,"['Disturbia', ""n't"", 'original', ""n't"", 'too', 'scary', 'gory', 'What', 'though', 'fun', 'popcorn', 'yarn', 'teen', 'named', 'Kale', 'Shia', 'LeBeouf', 'who', 'placed', 'house', 'arrest', 'taking', 'out', 'little', 'internal', 'anguish', 'Spanish', 'teacher', 'mother', 'Carrie-Anne', 'Moss', 'away', 'television', 'music', 'X-box', 'What', 'bored', 'teen', 'living', 'suburbia', 'do', 'pass', 'time', 'Spy', 'neighbors', 'course', 'newest', 'neighbor', 'Ashley', 'Sarah', 'Roemer', 'knockout', 'regularly', 'scheduled', 'swims', 'rooftop', 'reading', 'breaks', 'Once', 'neighbors', 'daily', 'lives', 'timed', 'perfectly', 'friend', 'Ronnie', 'Aaron', 'Yoo', 'voyeuristic', 'world', 'duo', 'caught', 'spying', 'Ashley', 'up', 'befriending', 'when', 'tell', 'believe', 'one', 'particular', 'neighbor', 'Mr.', 'Turner', 'underused', 'David', 'Morse', 'might', 'be', 'serial', 'killer', 'Texas', 'who', 'was', 'never', 'captured.This', 'film', 'motion', 'three', 'friends', 'try', 'uncover', 'truth', 'very', 'private', 'neighbor', 'only', 'problem', 'clue', 'find', 'might', 'lead', 'truth', 'Turner', 'be', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'Things', 'get', 'even', 'crazier', 'when', 'police', 'think', 'Kale', 'crying', 'wolf', 'everything.What', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'very', 'funny', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'being', 'funny', 'sophomoric', 'slasher', 'movie', 'way', 'very', 'smart', 'humor', 'here', 'Director', 'D.J', 'Caruso', 'humor', 'spread', 'just', 'thin', 'enough', 'keep', 'suspense', 'acceptable', 'level', 'cast', 'very', 'likeable', 'LeBeouf', 'ever-present', 'goofiness', 'when', 'be', 'afraid', 'angry', 'off', 'perfectly', 'Morse', 'sneaky', 'sinister', 'same', 'time', 'murderer', 'not', 'guy', 'will', 'creep', 'out', 'Moss', 'solid', 'very', 'small', 'role', 'fill', 'LeBeouf', 'pals', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'well.The', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'offer', 'film', 'more', 'one', 'look', 'standard', 'Making', 'featurette', 'outtakes', 'forgettable', 'music', 'video', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'photo', 'gallery', 'digital', 'transfer', 'good', 'audio', 'nice', 'well.Overall', 'Disturbia', 'very', 'fun', 'suspense', 'flick', 'not', 'Hitchcock-caliber', 'then', 'again', 'few', 'films', 'are', 'want', 'Hitchcock', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'Disturbia', 'want', 'good', 'film', 'watch', 'quiet', 'evening', 'home', 'film', 'one']",N/A

1083059,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000RO6K80,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 5]","I suspect that a large segment of those who watch ""Disturbia"" are not going to be aware that it is inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's classic ""Rear Window"" unless somebody tells them.  But the parallels would have beeen obvious to me thirty minutes into the film and my perspective is that of someone who knows the original and is willing to see a different take on the story.  The screenplay by Christopher Landon (""Another Day In Paradise"") and Carl Ellsworth (""Red Eye"") maintains the basic premise of Cornell Woolrich's short story: someone confined to seeing the world by looking out their window becomes suspicious of a neighbor they discover is a murderer.  Instead of Jimmy Stewart having a broken leg or quadriplegicChristopher Reevetrapped in a wheelchair, we have a young boy under house arrest confined to his home by an ankle bracelet (thanks to Paris Hilton's legal escapades this summer more people have an understanding of how such monitors work, that is for sure).""Disturbia"" begins with a pair of scenes to set up the premise in a rather unusual way (Ironically we had caught the start of ""Final Destination 2"" on television this afternoon).  The whole idea is to justify having Kale (Shia LaBeouf) confined at home with that ankle monitor and it is an interesting choice to have the highway scene and the schoolroom scene be the two halves of the equation.  There are a lot of ways of setting up the situation and there are some implications for the character and the story by setting it up this way.  Because this is the 21st century it is also necessary for Kale's mom (Carrie-Anne Moss) to strip away his ties to the Internet and other media and technology to make him willing to pick up a pair of binoculars and start spying on his neighbors (""reality without the TV,"" as he calls it).Two people in particular attract Kale's interest once his lets his voyeuristic side loose.  The first is Ashley (Sarah Roemer), the girl who has moved next door with her family.  Kale has a great view of her bedroom and gets to watch her while she changes and when she goes swimming, but he is also intrigued by the fact she spends more time on her roof reading books than inside her house.  The other person of interest is Mr. Turner (David Morse, who certainly has played more than his fair share of villains since he was the idealistic young Dr. Jack Morrison on ""St. Elsewhere"").  Watching the news instead of his computer Kale picks up on a story about a missing woman and sees a connection to Turner.  The more he watches Turner, the more connections he makes and the more he pushes Ashley and his friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) to go where he cannot go to further investigate.  Of course, this is a most dangerous game and things turn deadly.Directed by D.J. Caruso (""The Salton Sea""), this 2007 film does a good job of playing out the exigencies and constraints of Kale's home confinement to make the story work, with ""The Boy Who Cried Wolf"" added to complicate things .  Unlike Hitchcock, who was working with looking out at a courtyard at a bunch of apartments with large picture windows, Caruso is using a neighborhood where houses have smaller window and those windows have curtains.  This means Kale's view of what is happening in these other houses in never quite as clear and it forces Caruso to find other ways to allow Kale (and the audience) to get a picture of what is happening.  The end game of ""Distrubia"" goes a way bigger than ""Rear Window,"" which I suppose is a necessity for a modern film, but which does not result in a better finale.  But by the time you get to the final act you have long abandoned trying to make everything in ""Disturbia"" match up with ""Rear Window.""  Ashley is her own character and not a teenage version of Grace Kelly, and Ronnie is definitely not channeling Thelma Ritter.  My major concern is that when we get to the tipping point, the moment where no matter what else happens the villain is not going to get away with it, things escalate.",4,Introducing a new generation to the dangers of spying on your neighbors,1187395200,"08 18, 2007",2007,3991,"['suspect', 'large', 'segment', 'who', 'watch', 'Disturbia', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'aware', 'inspired', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'classic', 'Rear', 'Window', 'somebody', 'parallels', 'would', 'have', 'beeen', 'obvious', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'film', 'perspective', 'someone', 'who', 'original', 'willing', 'see', 'different', 'take', 'story', 'screenplay', 'Christopher', 'Landon', 'Day', 'Paradise', 'Carl', 'Ellsworth', 'Red', 'Eye', 'basic', 'premise', 'Cornell', 'Woolrich', 'short', 'story', 'someone', 'confined', 'seeing', 'world', 'looking', 'out', 'window', 'suspicious', 'neighbor', 'discover', 'murderer', 'Instead', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'having', 'broken', 'leg', 'quadriplegicChristopher', 'Reevetrapped', 'wheelchair', 'have', 'young', 'boy', 'house', 'arrest', 'confined', 'home', 'ankle', 'bracelet', 'thanks', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'legal', 'escapades', 'summer', 'more', 'people', 'have', 'understanding', 'how', 'such', 'monitors', 'work', 'sure', 'Disturbia', 'pair', 'scenes', 'set', 'up', 'premise', 'rather', 'unusual', 'way', 'Ironically', 'had', 'caught', 'start', 'Final', 'Destination', '2', 'television', 'afternoon', 'whole', 'idea', 'justify', 'having', 'Kale', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'confined', 'home', 'ankle', 'monitor', 'interesting', 'choice', 'have', 'highway', 'scene', 'schoolroom', 'scene', 'be', 'two', 'halves', 'equation', 'are', 'lot', 'ways', 'setting', 'up', 'situation', 'are', 'implications', 'character', 'story', 'setting', 'up', 'way', '21st', 'century', 'also', 'necessary', 'Kale', 'mom', 'Carrie-Anne', 'Moss', 'strip', 'away', 'ties', 'Internet', 'other', 'media', 'technology', 'make', 'willing', 'pick', 'up', 'pair', 'binoculars', 'start', 'spying', 'neighbors', 'reality', 'TV', 'people', 'particular', 'attract', 'Kale', 'interest', 'once', 'lets', 'voyeuristic', 'side', 'loose', 'first', 'Ashley', 'Sarah', 'Roemer', 'girl', 'who', 'moved', 'next', 'door', 'family', 'Kale', 'great', 'view', 'bedroom', 'watch', 'changes', 'when', 'swimming', 'also', 'intrigued', 'fact', 'more', 'time', 'roof', 'reading', 'books', 'house', 'other', 'person', 'interest', 'Mr.', 'Turner', 'David', 'Morse', 'who', 'certainly', 'played', 'more', 'fair', 'share', 'villains', 'was', 'idealistic', 'young', 'Dr.', 'Jack', 'Morrison', 'St', 'Elsewhere', 'Watching', 'news', 'instead', 'computer', 'Kale', 'up', 'story', 'missing', 'woman', 'connection', 'Turner', 'more', 'Turner', 'more', 'connections', 'more', 'Ashley', 'friend', 'Ronnie', 'Aaron', 'Yoo', 'go', 'where', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'further', 'investigate', 'course', 'most', 'dangerous', 'game', 'things', 'turn', 'deadly.Directed', 'D.J', 'Caruso', 'Salton', 'Sea', '2007', 'film', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'out', 'exigencies', 'constraints', 'Kale', 'home', 'confinement', 'make', 'story', 'work', 'Boy', 'Who', 'Cried', 'Wolf', 'added', 'complicate', 'things', 'Hitchcock', 'who', 'was', 'working', 'looking', 'out', 'courtyard', 'bunch', 'apartments', 'large', 'picture', 'windows', 'Caruso', 'using', 'neighborhood', 'where', 'houses', 'have', 'smaller', 'window', 'windows', 'have', 'curtains', 'Kale', 'view', 'what', 'happening', 'other', 'houses', 'never', 'quite', 'clear', 'Caruso', 'find', 'other', 'ways', 'allow', 'Kale', 'audience', 'get', 'picture', 'what', 'happening', 'end', 'game', 'Distrubia', 'way', 'bigger', 'Rear', 'Window', 'suppose', 'necessity', 'modern', 'film', 'not', 'result', 'better', 'finale', 'time', 'get', 'final', 'act', 'have', 'long', 'abandoned', 'trying', 'make', 'everything', 'Disturbia', 'match', 'Rear', 'Window', 'Ashley', 'own', 'character', 'not', 'teenage', 'version', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'Ronnie', 'definitely', 'not', 'channeling', 'Thelma', 'Ritter', 'major', 'concern', 'when', 'get', 'tipping', 'point', 'moment', 'where', 'matter', 'what', 'else', 'villain', 'not', 'going', 'get', 'away', 'things', 'escalate']",N/A

In a fit of rage, Kale, played by Shia LaBeouf (Transformers, Indiana Jones 4), sucker punches his Spanish teacher in class. His surprisingly lenient sentence is three months house arrest, given only because he has not yet turned eighteen.The crux ofDisturbia (Full Screen Edition)is what the main characer does to fill his time. While his friends are partying in Hawaii for the summer, Kale quietly observes the neighborhood through  binoculars and fancy camera equipment. Mostly he watches an attractive new neighbor (Sarah Roemer) whose only outfit seems to be a very tight, pink two-piece bikini. But after weeks of watching the neighbors go about their business, Kale notices certain patterns. He knows that when the middle-aged woman next door goes to tennis practice, her husband gets touchy with the maid. He knows when the shut-in mows his lawn. And he notices an older man with a suspicious vehicle and an affinity for scantily-clad young women, one of whom never leaves his house after a one-night-stand.The trouble with being on house arrest is your credibility is shot. His mother, friends and even the police do not believe him when he warns about the secretive neighbor. The welcome climax comes after mmuch prolonged suspense.

1083082,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B000RO6K80,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[1, 2]","I knew that Disturbia was loosely based on Rear Window, which is essentially a murder mystery from the perspective of a peeping tom.  The protagonist is confined to a house and thus can only interpret his surroundings through sight and sound at a distance; he eventually comes to suspect that his neighbor is a murderer.That's about all there is in common between the two films.  Disturbia has to do some fancy footwork to get the concept to work today.  With kids having more freedom and more information access than ever before, isolating a character is a challenge.  This is true of most horror these days--ubiquitous cell phones mean it's more difficult to create the sense of isolation so critical to horror.But Disturbia pulls it off.  Kale (Shia LaBeouf) and his father Daniel's (Matt Craven) fishing trip is cut brutally short by a car accident that kills Kale's dad.  Kale is emotionally isolated from his peers at school, who can't possibly understand what he's been through.Flash forward a year later and Kale, who seemed bright and cheerful, is now an introverted, angry young man.  When a high school teacher pushes his buttons, Kale responds with violence. That violence puts Kale under house arrest, physically isolating him. Thanks to his ankle bracelet, Kale can't run more than a few hundred feet without the police being alerted.Kale's mother, Julie (the delectable Carrie-Anne Moss), wants to ensure that this house arrest is punishment.  After all, how many kids would be perfectly happy sitting indoors, playing Xbox, listening to their iPod, and watching television all day?  Julie revokes all entertainment privileges, leaving Kale with nothing to do but stare out the window.This is all happening during summer vacation, so Kale's now socially isolated too, with only his friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) as company.  That means no parties and no dating.  Never mind that his hot neighbor, Ashley (Sarah Roemer) leaves her blinds open and is fond of taking swims in skimpy bathing suits.  Or that she likes to host parties for the cool kids.  Kale couldn't attend if he wanted to.Kale's isolation is complete and now on par with L.B. Jeffries from Rear Window, who was physically disabled and a photographer to boot.Disturbia cleverly turns the first part of the film into a teen drama.  Kale has a crush on Ashley, who eventually discovers that he's spying on her and boldly comes over to visit.  She too is isolated, having just moved into town--surely every teenage boy's dream of having the first shot at a hot girl!Once the Scooby gang of Kale, Ashley, and Ronnie is established, the plot really starts rolling.  Robert Turner (David Morse, looking more dangerous and creepy than ever) also moved in next store.  When the murders of a serial killer with a fondness for redheads are broadcast on the evening news, Kale starts to wonder about his neighbor's late night activities.What ensues is an exercise in YouTube-culture.  Kale sets about spying on his neighbor with zeal.  Ashley and Ronnie get in on the act, following Robert around and even breaking into his car and house.  Disturbia asks us: when is it okay to violate someone else's privacy?  And doesn't the right to privacy mean that very bad people get to do horrible things in private?Like any good thriller, Disturbia relies heavily on its actors.  LaBeouf carries the film, alternately sarcastic, voyeuristic, pathetic, bored, romantic, and angry -- just like so many teenage boys.  Morse turns his sad, lonely demeanor into a creepy vibe that makes you feel dirty just listening to him.Older thrillers had the luxury of time.  With shorter attention spans and less tolerance for reality-straining conventions, once the tipping point is reached, Disturbia turns into an all out slasher-fest.  And that's oddly appropriate, even cathartic, for thrillers of the millennial generation.  Once the truth is on video, it spreads like wildfire.There's a moment in the film where Robert calmly explains how he likes his privacy and why it's so important to him.

1083085,AN8M401S8Y6DA,B000RO6K80,Mike Liddell,"[1, 2]","Why would people think they are going to hate Disturbia?  First off any new film at all linked in any way shape or form to anything Alfred Hitchcock has done has a built in crowd of people who are going to hate it, regardless if it's good or not.  Plot wise it is in some ways taking from Rear Window as the Amazon plot synopsis says, I can see that, but pretend you didn't hear that.  Hitchcock's Rear Window is a great classic, this isn't that, end of story.Secondly the way we see teens these days could annoy anyone.  Growing up in an age where it's against the law for parents to discipline a kid now.  Also if you've ever watched MTV, specifically ""The Real World"", which basically is the opposite of it's title.  In the show they take seven models who they know are going to disagree and are young spoiled and immature mostly, put them in a mansion, and give them a dream job without working for anything, That's the real world?  Hardly.  Perhaps you have privileged kids that grew up in the suburbs, who, have never been in a fight of any sort, acting all ghetto, claiming you best give them respect when they've never earned any, and think there tough because they saw a rap video, and think turning there hat to the side makes them a gangster.  Obviously this isn't every teenager and I'm sure every teen from every generation have their flaws, just in this day and age it's all over you tube and television with reality tv.And sometimes you get directors and writers of horror flicks that I have to think base how they think teenagers act by what they've seen solely on MTV or the latest cell phone commercial.  Disturbia is none of those things.The Negatives, sure there are a lot of plot holes, but before you yell them out give the film a chance, it may answer them and may not need our feedback at the screen.  Somethings get far fetched but the good out weighs the bad in my opinion.So, what's good about Disturbia.  You have a character in LaBeouf who is actually a good and likable kid, and Labeouf shows his acting chops and great range.  He shows great anger and passion without saying much but more than a look in his eyes when a teacher makes an out of line comment about his father who passed.  Then he shows us convincing rage when his friend plays a joke on him.  None of it is over the top and it's all believable.  When his mom walks up behind him in his room as he is peering out the window and scares him, he doesn't yell at her and say something like, ""like mom like what are you doing in my room like totally get out"", he's cool with her and jokes with her ""your like a ninja or something"" and it's actually funny.  You have to give credit to the writers who apparently know teens beyond what they see on MTV and write relatable lines and scenarios for Labeouf that he adds to with his acting talent.To recap, you get a good entertaining thriller from literally start to finish, with a script that is teens could relate to in a horror/thriller like Apatow does with comedy.  And a rising star in Labeouf with that it factor who grows beyond the Disney kid, or the project greenlight guy, and keeps moving forward.  He also pulled of a hilarious hosting job on SNL earlier in the year as well.  I would recommend this for some good fun and entertainment and I think teenagers, the one's we like, will love this film.It may not be this artistic film but I actually bit my nails, no lie.The Hd dvd looked and sounded amazing as usual.",4,Why you think you'll hate disturbia and why you shouldn't.,1189900800,"09 16, 2007",2007,3462,"['Why', 'would', 'people', 'think', 'are', 'going', 'hate', 'Disturbia', 'First', 'new', 'film', 'linked', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'anything', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'done', 'built', 'crowd', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'going', 'hate', 'regardless', 'good', 'not', 'Plot', 'wise', 'ways', 'taking', 'Rear', 'Window', 'Amazon', 'plot', 'synopsis', 'can', 'see', 'pretend', 'did', ""n't"", 'hear', 'Hitchcock', 'Rear', 'Window', 'great', 'classic', ""n't"", 'that', 'end', 'story.Secondly', 'way', 'see', 'teens', 'days', 'could', 'annoy', 'anyone', 'Growing', 'up', 'age', 'where', 'law', 'parents', 'discipline', 'kid', 'now', 'Also', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'watched', 'MTV', 'specifically', 'Real', 'World', 'basically', 'opposite', 'title', 'show', 'take', 'seven', 'models', 'who', 'know', 'are', 'going', 'disagree', 'are', 'young', 'spoiled', 'immature', 'mostly', 'put', 'mansion', 'give', 'dream', 'job', 'working', 'anything', 'real', 'world', 'Hardly', 'Perhaps', 'have', 'privileged', 'kids', 'grew', 'up', 'suburbs', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'fight', 'sort', 'acting', 'ghetto', 'claiming', 'best', 'give', 'respect', 'when', ""'ve"", 'never', 'earned', 'think', 'tough', 'saw', 'rap', 'video', 'think', 'turning', 'there', 'hat', 'side', 'gangster', 'Obviously', ""n't"", 'teenager', ""'m"", 'sure', 'teen', 'generation', 'have', 'flaws', 'just', 'day', 'age', 'tube', 'television', 'reality', 'tv.And', 'sometimes', 'get', 'directors', 'writers', 'horror', 'flicks', 'have', 'think', 'base', 'how', 'think', 'teenagers', 'act', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'solely', 'MTV', 'latest', 'cell', 'phone', 'commercial', 'Disturbia', 'none', 'things.The', 'Negatives', 'sure', 'are', 'lot', 'plot', 'holes', 'yell', 'out', 'give', 'film', 'chance', 'may', 'answer', 'may', 'not', 'need', 'feedback', 'screen', 'Somethings', 'get', 'far', 'fetched', 'good', 'out', 'bad', 'opinion.So', 'what', 'good', 'Disturbia', 'have', 'character', 'LaBeouf', 'who', 'actually', 'good', 'likable', 'kid', 'Labeouf', 'acting', 'chops', 'great', 'range', 'great', 'anger', 'passion', 'saying', 'much', 'more', 'look', 'eyes', 'when', 'teacher', 'line', 'comment', 'father', 'who', 'passed', 'Then', 'convincing', 'rage', 'when', 'friend', 'joke', 'None', 'top', 'believable', 'When', 'mom', 'up', 'room', 'peering', 'out', 'window', ""n't"", 'yell', 'say', 'something', 'mom', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'room', 'totally', 'get', 'out', 'cool', 'jokes', 'ninja', 'something', 'actually', 'funny', 'have', 'give', 'credit', 'writers', 'who', 'apparently', 'know', 'what', 'see', 'MTV', 'write', 'relatable', 'lines', 'scenarios', 'Labeouf', 'acting', 'talent.To', 'recap', 'get', 'good', 'entertaining', 'thriller', 'literally', 'start', 'finish', 'script', 'teens', 'could', 'relate', 'horror/thriller', 'Apatow', 'comedy', 'rising', 'star', 'Labeouf', 'factor', 'who', 'Disney', 'kid', 'project', 'greenlight', 'guy', 'moving', 'forward', 'also', 'pulled', 'hilarious', 'hosting', 'job', 'SNL', 'earlier', 'year', 'as', 'well', 'would', 'recommend', 'good', 'fun', 'entertainment', 'think', 'teenagers', 'one', 'like', 'will', 'love', 'film.It', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'artistic', 'film', 'actually', 'bit', 'nails', 'lie.The', 'Hd', 'dvd', 'looked', 'sounded', 'amazing', 'usual']",N/A

I have to say this one gives exactly what you would expect from a PG-13 rated horror/thriller/slasher film, although the slasher isn't really acurate.  Anyway, you have the rebel teen who is of course an electronics whiz and his goofy buddy, Ronnie, who stole the scenery every time he was on camera.  He was hilarious. (Kind of stupid, but Hilarious).  The bad guy neighbor was okay, but really not that menacing.  Heck, he could have kept the whole thing secret if he'd just shrugged off the interference by the snoopy kids next door.  Ashley, played by Sarah Roemer was nice to look at, but when it came crunch time, where was she?  She could have just been a second buddy for Kale.  Another reveiwer got her performance right on: She played the part like a deer caught in the headlights.  And then there are the police in this film.  What community is this?  This kid with an ankle bracelet steps out of his yard and twenty seconds later it seems like the entire S.W.A.T. team is storming the front lawn.  Heck, I lived in Cleveland where you have to set off a flare and put up a searchlight to attract a patrol car.  I can't imagine that kind of response to a teenager walking away from his front yard wearing an ankle bracelet.

1083093,A3DDPQ9342UNMY,B000RO6K80,"N. Doyle ""film buff""","[1, 2]","DISTURBIA is a hip tale about a restless middle-class teen (SHIA LaBEOUF--what a name!!) under house arrest after punching his Spanish teacher and forced to wear a leg bracelet that sets off an alarm if he goes outside his restricted bounds. When his mother deprives him of entertainment as further punishment, he starts spying on some interesting neighbors, a la James Stewart in REAR WINDOW, with plenty of modern tools, like camcorders, at his disposal. It's a gimmicky tale but it works.It starts with a brutal road accident after a fishing trip with his dad that ends with a startling scene before the title credit. But it takes awhile for the story to get into high gear and start delivering the chills one is waiting for in a tale of this kind.SARAH ROEMER is the pretty girl next door who is soon joining Shia in his spying activities; AARON YOO supplies plenty of comic relief as Shia's Oriental friend; CARRIE-ANNE MOSS is understandably under a strain as Shia's stressed out mother; and David MORSE is sufficiently creepy as the neighbor suspected of harboring some dark secrets.Handsomely photographed, it's a letdown only when the shaky camera movement is used for certain crucial scenes such as the finale in a dark cellar. It seems that every filmmaker today likes to use that technique which should have been restricted to the likes of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.The last twenty-five minutes are well staged and exciting, building up to the suspenseful climax. Shia deserves full praise for practically carrying the film with an authentic portrait of an energetic teen with too much time on his hands.It's a satisfying thrill ride but not something to go out of your way to see.On the debit side: The most disturbing thing about the DVD commentary by the director, Shia and Sarah, is that it's not exactly illuminating. Shia has them both counting how many times he says ""S**t"" within the space of a scene (and throughout the commentary too) which immediately cracks them up. It goes downhill from that point on. They chuckle like kids over every punch line or comic moment with little insight into the storyline.

1083103,A3S0IVFM83ZSE7,B000RO6K80,P. Hardy,"[3, 4]","As thrillers go (especially ones garnered toward the younger population) they're either hit or miss. With the revival of teen horror/thriller films, most as of late have been a rather large rotting pile of miss. In the beginning, I was highly skeptical and quite annoyed with Disturbia, especially when it gained so much success in the box-office. [""Shallow teenagers strike again"" I thought.] So naturally, my curiosity was aroused and thus I decided to find out how I would like the movie myself. If you don't concern yourself with the popularity (or a particular someone starring in it) of this film, or its surprising success given its genre, then you just might find yourself enjoying the Non-Rear Window-'inspired' ---its not a remake of the elder film, as most people assume though its obviously inspired by it--- film. Honestly it reminded me of ""What Lies Beneath"", another Hitchcock inspired film, minus the cheating/vengeful husband and lurking ghosts). Unlike ""Stick It (2006)"" it nearly manages to fall away from its cliche Teen-movie atmosphere before tumbling back down the slope into mediocrity.The beginning of the film introduces us to Kale Brecht (Shia LaBeouf) on a fishing trip, of his own volition, with his father, Daniel Brecht (Matt Craver), attempting to catch an illusive fish to no avail. The two are heading home when they become the unfortunate victims of a car accident (caused partly by a distracted Kale, partly by a large SUV, though its debatable) which only Kale manages to survive. Fast forward one year later, we find a depressed Kale asleep in class and unable to answer a seemingly simple question in his Spanish class. However, Se&ntilde;or Gutierrez (Rene Rivera), unwilling to let Kale off the hook when given an undecided answer and decides to guilt-trip the boy by inquiring ""What would your father think?"" and his rightfully popped in the face for his troubles. Although justified, Kale is let off easy by the courts and is placed under 3 month house arrest for the assault. Should be easy right?Not for Kale.Kale's attempts to keep himself busy are derailed when his stern-but-loving mother, Julie Brecht (Carrie-Ann Moss), cancels his iTunes and X-BOX Live memeberships (he doesn't even consider playing games offline. Idiot) and cuts the cord to Television when he decides to get smart with her [that was priceless scene]. Now without a 'constructive' thing to do, Kale takes vengeance on the washing machine and dishwasher, whilst attempting to get news from the outside world via Ronnie (Aaron Yoo), but to no avail. After peering upon a young woman, Ahsley Carlson (Sarah Roemer), moving into the Suburbs with her family and immediately taking attraction to her, it is then, that Kale dares to venture into his father's study to retrieve his red-tinted Binoculars and do some spying on the neighborhood --- or rather peep in on Ashley through her open window. (Apparently the Suburbs don't have a problem  with thieves and peeping toms.) He pays little attention to the docile Robert Turner (David Morse) until spots Mr. Turner coming home one night with a dented 1960's/1967 era Ford Mustang as described like the one missing in a murder case of a young woman. Aided by newcomer Ashley and best friend Ronnie, Kale attempts to unravel the mystery enshrouding Mr. Turner when, what started out as a game to dispel boredom becomes far too real for him to handle.Post-House Arrest, DISTURBIA focuses the first half-hour on Kale's painfully obvious inability to cope with the fact that he is virtually cooped up in his house without the simple pleasures of an out-and-about boy, save his Sixty-Gigabyte iPod and Television. It takes its time to build on Kale's character, which at times felt like I was watching an obnoxious, sometimes moody ""Shia LaBeouf"" and not ""Kale Brecht"", [I.E., the character felt far too similar to the personality the actor emits to the public instead of 'Kale', a character we know little about aside from the beginning of the movie], before introducing the romantic interest played Sarah Roemer. Ironically it doesn't even focus on the source of Kale [and Julie's] problems (his dead father). The plot is nothing of the unexpected nature, the trailer tells you right off what its about to an extent, but it is handled intelligently. In the first time watching it, the film does make one jump with the sudden raise in tensity in the music or the usual one-time only cheap scare ploys. Instead Disturbia plays off its story to the audience in a way that doesn't behave as if the viewer isn't supposed to know what's going on. It also manages to surprise you every now and again with tiny plot twists or deceptions. However, as this 104 Minute movie reaches the climax, the slow and steady pace is dropped for a rushed ending of the expected kind and that disappointed me greatly. The movie is great and yet the editor and director decided that they were tired of taking their time and just dropped all semblance of patience and destroy the atmosphere (cut out ""What Lies Beneath""s chloroform scenario/bath tub scene and you've got yourself an unsatisfying ending to a otherwise excellent movie). Either that or they ran out of ideas on how make the movie another hour longer. With the way it ended, with its lame cliche-happy ending suck-face session, DISTURBIA really made me believe they could've gone another way with it.The acting in this film is top notch from some of the actors, while others are just less than convincing. First off, Carrie-Anne Moss as Julie Bracht makes a convincing mother whom, for once, isn't portrayed as stupid and completely unawares of the situation her son has gotten himself into. However, Moss' character is under utilized in this film and watching the Deleted Scenes (""Do you want to Talk?"" - ""I Forbid it"" - and - ""You Are Breaking my Heart"") showcase this point clearly with amazing scenes between Moss and LaBeouf. These scenes also touch on the fact that Julie was supposedly dating Mr. Turner and how the loss of her husband created a rift between mother and son. David Morse, the memorable bad-cop from ""16 BLOCKS"", is convincing as the unsettling Robert Turner, a seemingly kind man and understanding person. Like, Carrie-Anne Moss, Morse is also an under utilized actor who performs to the best of his abilities with so little he has for a character. Aaron Yoo as Kale's quirky and typical sidekick buddy [in way of EVEN STEVEN's Twitty], Ronnie (the only main character in the movie with one name aside from ""Greenwood"") is funny and convincingly serious though moments like that are few and far between. Shia LaBeouf, surprisingly, has managed to become a convincing actor since ""HOLES"", and while his past and recent (when I say recent, I meant ""Surf's Up"" recent. He was excellent in TRANSFORMERS) films are shy of interesting or compelling, and while his performance in this film is good, the character he plays is a more mellow version of Sam Witwicky, only Sam Witwicky is the more interesting character. Whilst the circumstances between the two characters are majorly different, their quirks and end results (geek gets the girl) are practically the same. LaBeouf's performance in DISTURBIA is nearly identical to that in TRANSFORMERS. He's got a ways to go before he becomes a truly great character actor, but he defiantly is one of the better actors of his age. And lastly, Sarah Roemer's presence in this movie is completely forgettable (but given her movie resume in the industry, I'm not surprised). Her performance Ashley Carlson is composed of slanking about in that would-be sensual way with her shoulders half-hunched, drawling out her words, and appearing shallow to the rest of the world while Kale sees a much more complex person. If Ashley was 'more than meets the eye' then the writers should've portrayed as such, instead of the actually shallow ""your mom's hot"" conformist romantic interest. The only time she actually hit me was a character of some depth is when she was spying on and went against Mr. Turner at the end of the movie.Acting aside, Geoff Zanelli's score for DISTURBIA is without a doubt a score I would invest money in buying. Naturally, it reflects the atmosphere and the characters it surrounds, with quirky up-beat themes to tense and action packed themes suitable for a fleeting thriller movie such as this. The theme used for Kale and Daniel's fishing trip is probably the best amongst the more lighter themes (aside from 'Poofoot' ^_^). The 'Voyeurism' theme, while symbolical and emotionally moving, was missused in wrong the scenes and played almost repetitively whenever Ashley Carlson would show up, which was irritating to say the least. Another irritating, yet amusing, and repetitive theme used is the one whenever Kale would enter his father's study (especially after he lays out the guidelines of his Ankle's monitor's 100ft limit and sees Ashley again). As for the 'Various Artists' soundtrack; If you want a bad soundtrack just pick up Disturbia's second CD Release. While I commend the use of elder bands (from the year 2000), the music chosen is terrible, especially the theme for 'Kale and Ashley' they decided to make a Music Video for (do you see a pattern here?). Compared to the awesome pile of crap they call music they have featured in this, TRANSFORMERS - THE ALBUM is a gem (and it is).So all in all, DISTURBIA is an great movie, but with a little more time spent on fleshing out the characters and the storyline overall, it would've been excellent. But as it is, its probably one of the better thrillers of 2007 since ""Premonition"". ---- [a 4 out of 5] ------ [8/30/31/07]",4,"""That's no ordinary look.

Kale Brecht, played by Shia LaBeouf, is placed on house arrest after he punches his teacher, the man having made a snide remark about his recently deceased father.  While confined to his house, Kale takes to spying on his neighbors and comes to believe that the man living next door, played by David Morse, is a serial killer.  This film is full of witty dialogue, especially from the teenaged actors, and most of it is funny.  You might think it's just another slasher film, and I'll admit that the ending sort of goes down that road, but it overall strives to be something more.  Overall, it succeeds.  The kids are likable...and more importantly, relatable.  David Morse is wonderfully creepy.  The plot never slacks off, though it does lag very slightly at times...personally I'd rather have that than if there was constant danger and suspense from beginning to end.  And it's not just some film about teenagers.  I liked it.  You might too.  Go ahead and give it a watch.

1083105,A7Q1W04HT3EKS,B000RO6K80,"Phillip ""amazon_phil""","[2, 4]","In this film, Shia LaBeouf proves that he can carry a film alone.  In this twist of Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"", LaBeouf plays Kale who is under house-arrest after an incident at school with his Spanish teacher.  So, his life revolves around the lives of his neighbors.  Kale has a special interest for his hot neighbor, Ashley, and arranges his time as peeping tom when Ashley swims in the pool and exercises in her room with blinds open.  Eventually, creepy neighbor, Mr. Turner, spooks Kale and he quickly recruits his best friend, Ronnie, and next-door girl, Ashley, to do some investigation.  Although this plot is predictable, the whole suspense is played out quite nicely between all the characters.  Overall, not overly-gross for those who are squeamish to this type of movie.  Amusing dialogue and entertaining with this modern take on ""Rear Window"".  I was especially amused by the techno gadgetry from simple electronics around the house.For the DVD extras, you will find that outtake scenes are quite brief (only 2-3 minutes) compared to other films on DVD.  I was expecting at least 10 to 20 minutes of outtakes.  The ""Making of Disturbia"" special is pretty much what you would expect from a studio.  The same comments are made by the actors on the commentary as in the special.  Also, the commentaries are pretty uneven since the actors break into interruptions from phone calls and comment on food that they're eating.  Well, I guess that I would be pretty bored analyzing each scene to death as well.  The director, Shia LeBouf, and Sarah Roemer do provide some entertaining conversations especially about Shia's experience with creatine for beefing up before ""Transformers"".  After listening to his unexpected side-effects, I don't think anyone will experiment with creatine.",4,"Rising Star, Shia LaBeouf, Shines in This Thriller",1186876800,"08 12, 2007",2007,1797,"['film', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'can', 'carry', 'film', 'alone', 'twist', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Rear', 'Window', 'LaBeouf', 'Kale', 'who', 'house-arrest', 'incident', 'school', 'Spanish', 'teacher', 'So', 'life', 'lives', 'neighbors', 'Kale', 'special', 'interest', 'hot', 'neighbor', 'Ashley', 'time', 'peeping', 'tom', 'when', 'Ashley', 'pool', 'exercises', 'room', 'blinds', 'open', 'Eventually', 'creepy', 'neighbor', 'Mr.', 'Turner', 'Kale', 'quickly', 'best', 'friend', 'Ronnie', 'next-door', 'girl', 'Ashley', 'do', 'investigation', 'plot', 'predictable', 'whole', 'suspense', 'played', 'out', 'quite', 'nicely', 'characters', 'Overall', 'not', 'overly-gross', 'who', 'are', 'squeamish', 'type', 'movie', 'Amusing', 'dialogue', 'entertaining', 'modern', 'take', 'Rear', 'Window', 'was', 'especially', 'amused', 'techno', 'gadgetry', 'simple', 'electronics', 'house.For', 'DVD', 'extras', 'will', 'find', 'outtake', 'scenes', 'are', 'quite', 'brief', 'only', '2-3', 'minutes', 'compared', 'other', 'films', 'DVD', 'was', 'expecting', 'least', '10', '20', 'minutes', 'outtakes', 'Making', 'Disturbia', 'special', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'studio', 'same', 'comments', 'are', 'made', 'actors', 'commentary', 'special', 'Also', 'commentaries', 'are', 'pretty', 'uneven', 'actors', 'break', 'interruptions', 'phone', 'calls', 'comment', 'food', ""'re"", 'eating', 'Well', 'guess', 'would', 'be', 'pretty', 'bored', 'analyzing', 'scene', 'death', 'as', 'well', 'director', 'Shia', 'LeBouf', 'Sarah', 'Roemer', 'do', 'provide', 'entertaining', 'conversations', 'especially', 'Shia', 'experience', 'creatine', 'beefing', 'up', 'Transformers', 'listening', 'unexpected', 'side-effects', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'will', 'experiment', 'creatine']",N/A

1083107,A2FUOXFJ74B32M,B000RO6K80,"P.K. Ryan ""The Ryan Identity""","[2, 4]","'Disturbia' was an interesting, if somewhat mediocre horror/suspense film that follows the 17 year old Kale (LaBeouf) and his unusual experiences in his upper middle-class suburb. The film starts with a beautiful scene of father and son fishing in the mountains (presumably out west somewhere). This appears to set the stage for the portrayal of the idyllic American existence, only to be shattered by tragedy minutes into the film. The troubled young Kale reacts to this tragedy by acting out and manages to get himself put under house arrest, which leaves him with plenty of time, and little to do. One of his hobbies is spying on his neighbors, and in between the adulterer across the street, and the new hot girl next door, Kale begins to suspect that his neighbor is a wanted serial killer. Is he right, or is his imagination getting the best of him?I'm not sure if the film's intent was to portray suburbia in general as some dark, morally corrupt place, just beneath the veneer of middle-class respectability, but I can see how one could make that inference. Or maybe it's just an isolated, Hitchcockian story about a serial killer and I'm looking way too deeply into it. Either way, the film was moderately entertaining, even though it was a bit slow going at times and didn't really do anything original.This was my first time watching this kid LaBeouf, and I think he was pretty good. His portrayal of a generally good-hearted, but troubled teenager was very believable and his personality actually reminded me a bit of myself at that age. In fact, the film brought up some bittersweet feelings about my own upbringing in suburbia. Overall, I would say that although 'Disturbia' is nothing particularly memorable, it serves it's purpose as an entertaining and suspenseful thriller. 3.5 stars.",3,Disturbia,1196467200,"12 1, 2007",2007,1802,"[""'Disturbia"", 'was', 'interesting', 'somewhat', 'mediocre', 'horror/suspense', 'film', '17', 'year', 'old', 'Kale', 'LaBeouf', 'unusual', 'experiences', 'upper', 'middle-class', 'suburb', 'film', 'beautiful', 'scene', 'father', 'son', 'fishing', 'mountains', 'presumably', 'out', 'west', 'somewhere', 'set', 'stage', 'portrayal', 'idyllic', 'American', 'existence', 'only', 'be', 'shattered', 'tragedy', 'minutes', 'film', 'troubled', 'young', 'Kale', 'tragedy', 'acting', 'out', 'manages', 'get', 'put', 'house', 'arrest', 'plenty', 'time', 'little', 'do', 'One', 'hobbies', 'spying', 'neighbors', 'adulterer', 'street', 'new', 'hot', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'Kale', 'suspect', 'neighbor', 'wanted', 'serial', 'killer', 'right', 'imagination', 'getting', 'best', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'film', 'intent', 'was', 'portray', 'suburbia', 'general', 'dark', 'morally', 'corrupt', 'place', 'just', 'veneer', 'middle-class', 'respectability', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'one', 'could', 'make', 'inference', 'just', 'isolated', 'Hitchcockian', 'story', 'serial', 'killer', ""'m"", 'looking', 'way', 'too', 'deeply', 'way', 'film', 'was', 'moderately', 'entertaining', 'even', 'was', 'bit', 'slow', 'going', 'times', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'anything', 'original.This', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'watching', 'kid', 'LaBeouf', 'think', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'portrayal', 'generally', 'good-hearted', 'troubled', 'teenager', 'was', 'very', 'believable', 'personality', 'actually', 'reminded', 'bit', 'myself', 'age', 'fact', 'film', 'brought', 'up', 'bittersweet', 'feelings', 'own', 'upbringing', 'suburbia', 'Overall', 'would', 'say', ""'Disturbia"", 'nothing', 'particularly', 'memorable', 'purpose', 'entertaining', 'suspenseful', 'thriller', '3.5', 'stars']",N/A

When his Mom Julie initiates a disciplinary programme of no X-Box, no iTunes and no TV, Kale takes to spying on his neighbours for amusement. Enter new neighbour family the Carlsons and their pretty daughter Ashley, who, drawn to Kale, begins to investigate the possibly murderous goings-on of neighbour Robert Turner.Shia LaBeouf and David Morse give great performances as Kale and Robert respectively: LeBeouf in particular is one of the better young actors working in mainstream movies today. Morse's is-he-or-isn't-he-crazy neighbour is most effective, and the pair create believable, watchable characters. The rest of the cast is reduced either to mere cameos (Carrie-Anne Moss, Viola Davis), or becomes another forgettable teen face in a forgettable teen movie (Sarah Roemer, Aaron Yoo).The script is very very bland.Directed with great style by mostly-TV's D.J. Caruso, ""Disturbia"" starts off well, with fluid storytelling and a nice tension to the opening scenes. It's got some nice sequences in the middle, too, when Kale, Ashley and Kale's buddy Ronnie are spying on Turner. And the ending is well-made with some pretty believable tension.Sadly, the rest of this 105 minute movie is mere filler for comparatively few scenes of interest, and it's difficult to force one's eyes open while Angry McTeenager is trying to seduce Generic Sunkissed Girl, or larking about with his very own Ronald Weasley-style sidekick.

I borrowed the film from the library, not knowing what to expect. I was pleased. Shia LaBeouf has always entertained, and David Morse and Carrie-Anne Moss are established and admired performers. I enjoyed it all, and I thought Sarah Roemer had more depth than many others. Certainly, suggestions of Hitchcock, which is not a bad thing, but also a bit of coming-of-age stuff, teen situations, etc. I had no problem with that. I thought Aaron Yoo as Ronnie was consistently appealing. Without everyone trying to make comparisons and point out what's wrong, I would only like to say what's right; mainly,  enjoyed it a lot, with no pre-conceived prejudice.I enjoy movies about kids doing good stuff; the Percy Jackson film was enjoyable and I hope there's another. I'm 62 years old, and am tired of the angst-ridden stuff about mean and rotten kids. This stuff is prevalent. I'd rather be entertained about good kids, hoping there might be a future for ALL kids.

This is a well-done, teen suspense flick. It's good to entertain for a couple hours every now and then, and not much more. But that's all it set out to do, so that is quite alright. In fact, ""quite alright"" is a great way to describe this fun little movie. Why people feel the need to constantly insult Shia Labeouf is beyond me. I don't find him to be the douche bag that many others call him. But what do I know? I don't track the man's every move. As far as this film goes, I liked him a lot as the lead. His hot-headed, youthful charm added a lot to the movie, in my opinon. For how frequently these types of teen thrillers turn out to be duds, I was pleasantly surprised to find this gem. The humor is sophomoric for the most part, but still fresh. The suspense is great. I never really clinched up like I did the first time I saw it in the theatre, but i still enjoy it nevertheless.

And that is pretty much what it is.  But as a 40 year old male, I have to say that on its own, unoriginal terms, DISTURBIA works pretty well.First of all, Shia LeBeouf is a very engaging screen actor.  This 20 year old, who was so good in HOLES and has done very nice roles in other films such as CONSTANTINE and THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED is starting to really come into his own.  He is offbeat looking enough that he doesn't come across as just another generic cast-off from ""One Tree Hill.""  He doesn't play it cool all the time...he's not afraid to look scared when the situation warrants.The film also benefits greatly from the malevolent force that is David Morse in ""psycho"" mode.  Ever since this normally gentle, mild-mannered actor (ST. ELSEWHERE's ""Boomer"") played a nut-case stone-cold killer in THE ROCK, he gets consistently cast as ""crazy.""  And he does it very, very well.  He's like a poor man's suburban Hannibal Lecter in DISTURBIA.  He gets under the skin of those who are chasing him...psyching them out as he sounds SO CREDIBLE and REASONABLE...yet you know he's a serial killer!!The movie is pleasant to watch (although the opening few scenes with LeBeouf and his screen father are almost too harsh).  Nice steady suspense, liberally sprinkled with mildly raunchy humor.  But it's all building to a pretty darn exciting final 20 minutes.  When this film kicks into high gear...it doesn't mess around.  The audience I saw it with (mostly teens) screamed and carried on quite enthusiastically.  My heart skipped a beat or two.This is no Shakespearean epic, nor does it approach the subtlety of Hitchcock.  But it is good for delivering some jolts and far more honest earned suspense than most movies these days.  While it won't win any Oscars, it's pretty darn fun.  3.5 stars.(One note of unhappiness:  what's happened to Carrie-Anne Moss' career??!??  She plays the mom, and her part is so underwritten, so thankless...it's just sad.)",4,"Better, more suspenseful than I would have thought!

Forget the high-powered binoculars that Jimmy Stewart had to rely upon in that earlier film to fulfill his voyeuristic tendencies; that's strictly old school stuff compared to the PCs, cell phones, camcorders and various other technological marvels the hero of ""Disturbia"" uses for his spying and sleuthing, proving that what is a bane for modern-day paranoiacs is clearly a boon for neighborhood Peeping Toms.Shia LeBeouf is Kale, a suburban teen placed under house arrest for punching out his Spanish teacher after the latter makes a cutting remark about Kale's recently deceased father in class.  Literally stuck at home with nothing to do, Kale begins to wile away the hours spying on his various neighbors, including, naturally, a young blonde hottie who has conveniently moved in right next door to the horny captive.  Kale also begins to suspect that the man down the street, who spends most of his free time benignly mowing his lawn, may, in fact, be a serial killer who lures beautiful women into his home and violently dispatches them.  Soon, Kale, his best friend from school, Ronnie, and the blonde cutie, named (what else?) Ashley, are crime-solving with the best of them, uncovering clues and closing in on the suspect even as they become aware that they might not be quite as invisible to their intended target as they originally thought they were.Despite its tendency to wander off into Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew-level melodramatics at times, ""Disturbia"" is a generally tidy little thriller, refreshingly simple and straightforward in a time when such films tend to be just a little too clever and a little too convoluted for their own good (the screenplay is blessedly devoid of those ""surprise"" turnabout plot twists that are practically de rigeur in modern movie thrillers).  There are plenty of holes and inconsistencies in the storyline, as is perhaps to be expected, but co-writers Christopher B. Landon and Carl Ellsworth, and director D. J. Caruso keep us from fixating too much on them with the skill of their filmmaking.  The climactic scenes are wickedly suspenseful, even if just about every shot feels derived from some previous film (""The Silence of the Lambs,"" ""The Shining,"" ""Poltergeist,"" and ""The Blair Witch Project"" seem to be the primary sources here).The key factor in ""Disturbia""'s success lies in LaBeouf's star-making performance in the lead role.  This talented and charismatic young actor has a slightly befuddled, puppy dog expression that gives the character the vulnerability he needs to make his heroics convincing.  He is nicely complemented by Aaron Yoo and Sarah Roemer as his partners in crime-detection, and by David Morse (the dad in ""Contact"") as the killer next door.",3,"simple, effective thriller",1178323200,"05 5, 2007",2007,2795,"['***1/2', 'Disturbia', 'Rear', 'Window', 'gadgets', 'lots', 'lots', 'gadgets', 'Forget', 'high-powered', 'binoculars', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'had', 'rely', 'earlier', 'film', 'fulfill', 'voyeuristic', 'tendencies', 'strictly', 'old', 'school', 'stuff', 'compared', 'PCs', 'cell', 'phones', 'camcorders', 'various', 'other', 'technological', 'marvels', 'hero', 'Disturbia', 'spying', 'sleuthing', 'proving', 'what', 'bane', 'modern-day', 'paranoiacs', 'clearly', 'boon', 'neighborhood', 'Peeping', 'Toms.Shia', 'LeBeouf', 'Kale', 'suburban', 'teen', 'placed', 'house', 'arrest', 'punching', 'out', 'Spanish', 'teacher', 'latter', 'cutting', 'remark', 'Kale', 'recently', 'deceased', 'father', 'class', 'Literally', 'stuck', 'home', 'nothing', 'do', 'Kale', 'wile', 'away', 'hours', 'spying', 'various', 'neighbors', 'including', 'naturally', 'young', 'blonde', 'hottie', 'who', 'conveniently', 'moved', 'right', 'next', 'door', 'horny', 'captive', 'Kale', 'also', 'suspect', 'man', 'down', 'street', 'who', 'most', 'free', 'time', 'benignly', 'mowing', 'lawn', 'may', 'fact', 'be', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'beautiful', 'women', 'home', 'violently', 'Soon', 'Kale', 'best', 'friend', 'school', 'Ronnie', 'blonde', 'cutie', 'named', 'what', 'else', 'Ashley', 'are', 'crime-solving', 'best', 'uncovering', 'clues', 'closing', 'suspect', 'even', 'become', 'aware', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'quite', 'invisible', 'intended', 'target', 'originally', 'thought', 'were.Despite', 'tendency', 'wander', 'off', 'Hardy', 'Boys/Nancy', 'Drew-level', 'melodramatics', 'times', 'Disturbia', 'generally', 'tidy', 'little', 'thriller', 'refreshingly', 'simple', 'straightforward', 'time', 'when', 'such', 'films', 'tend', 'be', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'clever', 'little', 'too', 'convoluted', 'own', 'good', 'screenplay', 'blessedly', 'devoid', 'surprise', 'turnabout', 'plot', 'twists', 'are', 'practically', 'de', 'rigeur', 'modern', 'movie', 'thrillers', 'are', 'plenty', 'holes', 'inconsistencies', 'storyline', 'perhaps', 'be', 'expected', 'co-writers', 'Christopher', 'B.', 'Landon', 'Carl', 'Ellsworth', 'director', 'D.', 'J.', 'Caruso', 'keep', 'fixating', 'too', 'much', 'skill', 'filmmaking', 'climactic', 'scenes', 'are', 'wickedly', 'suspenseful', 'even', 'just', 'shot', 'feels', 'derived', 'previous', 'film', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'Shining', 'Poltergeist', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'seem', 'be', 'primary', 'sources', 'here', '.The', 'key', 'factor', 'Disturbia', 'success', 'LaBeouf', 'star-making', 'performance', 'lead', 'role', 'talented', 'charismatic', 'young', 'actor', 'slightly', 'befuddled', 'puppy', 'dog', 'expression', 'character', 'vulnerability', 'make', 'heroics', 'convincing', 'nicely', 'complemented', 'Aaron', 'Yoo', 'Sarah', 'Roemer', 'partners', 'crime-detection', 'David', 'Morse', 'dad', 'Contact', 'killer', 'next', 'door']",N/A
1083115,A387BD735MI50R,B000RO6K80,R. Schultz,"[1, 3]","Don't be put off by the 50's B-flick title of this film. This is actually a fairly good thriller involving teenagers whom both young people and adults can care about.The two lead teens show themselves to be capable of a romance that's much more interesting than the simple grope-in-the-back-seat-of-a-car you usually get whenever any high-schooler is featured. These two actually talk to each other, and, (dare I use the word?) - ""share"" meaningful parts of their histories. Then when the newfound girlfriend makes common cause with Shia LeBoeuf as he begins to suspect his neighbor of being a serial killer - she does it, not just as an adjunct girl out to ""get"" a guy - but as someone with a truly independent curiosity. As a result, we viewers are in turn sincerely moved to make common cause with these teens, and peer with them through the binoculars at the ominous goings-on across the street.This movie takes its time in general, which also contributes to making it a stand-out from other teen movies. Its emphasis on character development is evident from the start. ""Disturbia"" opens with a daringly lengthy scene in a high-school Spanish class. I'm glad the Director didn't buckle under all the pressures now put on moviemakers to ""pick up the pace,"" because this scene is important. It not only shows how the lead character comes to be placed under house arrest - a necessary condition for his growing awareness of his neighbors. But the schoolroom scene also sets the tone of the movie in a subtler way. It shows the sadism of the teacher, coming out like a cat's claw from its padding. So we see how someone who is generally esteemed in the community - actually enjoys exercising a warped control behind closed classroom doors where he's been granted dominance. And so it turns out to be with Shia's neighbor.There are some problems with logic in this movie. Would a teenager in fact be kept out of school and put under extended house arrest for punching out a teacher?The biggest breech of logic here though involves the serial killer himself. It seems very unlikely that anyone would continue giving vent to his homicidal impulses so blatantly, so near his windows, even after he knows he is being watched. This puts the villain improbably over the top.Then there are some loose ends left dangling. For example, exactly what becomes of Shia's  pal, a role played with appealing verve by Aaron Yoo.There are a lot of bonus extras on this DVD, including an interactive pop-up. The trivia squibs activated by this option don't add much to the film. They tend to be altogether too trivial. And the Director's commentary is a little loose, with D. J. Caruso taking some phone calls in the middle of his narrative, thereby allowing a further trivializing annoyance.However these flaws weren't enough to spoil my appreciation of what is an essentially pretty good movie. Then seeing another movie with an obliquely similar theme at around the same time coincidentally enhanced my appreciation of both movies even more. If you want to see another film on the subject of surveillance, I recommend ""The Lives of Others."" This latter is a German film about surveillance in a police state. Coupled with ""Disturbia"" which shows surveillance starting out as a giddy teenage entertainment, you get a strangely stereoscopic effect on the theme of watching others from a distance.",3,Evil Behind Closed Doors,1193616000,"10 29, 2007",2007,3377,"['Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'put', 'off', '50', 'B-flick', 'title', 'film', 'actually', 'fairly', 'good', 'thriller', 'involving', 'teenagers', 'whom', 'young', 'people', 'adults', 'can', 'care', 'about.The', 'two', 'lead', 'teens', 'show', 'be', 'capable', 'romance', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'simple', 'grope-in-the-back-seat-of-a-car', 'usually', 'get', 'whenever', 'high-schooler', 'featured', 'two', 'actually', 'talk', 'other', 'dare', 'use', 'word', 'share', 'meaningful', 'parts', 'histories', 'Then', 'when', 'newfound', 'girlfriend', 'common', 'cause', 'Shia', 'LeBoeuf', 'suspect', 'neighbor', 'being', 'serial', 'killer', 'not', 'just', 'adjunct', 'girl', 'get', 'guy', 'someone', 'truly', 'independent', 'curiosity', 'result', 'viewers', 'are', 'turn', 'sincerely', 'moved', 'make', 'common', 'cause', 'teens', 'peer', 'binoculars', 'ominous', 'goings-on', 'street.This', 'movie', 'time', 'general', 'also', 'making', 'stand-out', 'other', 'teen', 'movies', 'emphasis', 'character', 'development', 'evident', 'start', 'Disturbia', 'daringly', 'lengthy', 'scene', 'high-school', 'Spanish', 'class', ""'m"", 'glad', 'Director', 'did', ""n't"", 'buckle', 'pressures', 'now', 'put', 'moviemakers', 'pick', 'up', 'pace', 'scene', 'important', 'not', 'only', 'how', 'lead', 'character', 'be', 'placed', 'house', 'arrest', 'necessary', 'condition', 'growing', 'awareness', 'neighbors', 'schoolroom', 'scene', 'also', 'tone', 'movie', 'subtler', 'way', 'sadism', 'teacher', 'coming', 'out', 'cat', 'claw', 'padding', 'see', 'how', 'someone', 'who', 'generally', 'esteemed', 'community', 'actually', 'exercising', 'warped', 'control', 'closed', 'classroom', 'doors', 'where', 'been', 'granted', 'dominance', 'out', 'be', 'Shia', 'are', 'problems', 'logic', 'movie', 'Would', 'teenager', 'fact', 'be', 'kept', 'school', 'put', 'extended', 'house', 'arrest', 'punching', 'out', 'teacher', 'biggest', 'breech', 'logic', 'here', 'serial', 'killer', 'very', 'unlikely', 'anyone', 'would', 'continue', 'giving', 'vent', 'homicidal', 'so', 'blatantly', 'so', 'windows', 'even', 'being', 'watched', 'villain', 'improbably', 'top.Then', 'are', 'loose', 'ends', 'left', 'dangling', 'example', 'exactly', 'what', 'Shia', 'pal', 'role', 'played', 'appealing', 'verve', 'Aaron', 'Yoo.There', 'are', 'lot', 'bonus', 'extras', 'DVD', 'including', 'interactive', 'pop-up', 'trivia', 'squibs', 'activated', 'option', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'much', 'film', 'tend', 'be', 'altogether', 'too', 'trivial', 'Director', 'commentary', 'little', 'loose', 'D.', 'J.', 'Caruso', 'taking', 'phone', 'middle', 'narrative', 'thereby', 'allowing', 'further', 'trivializing', 'flaws', 'were', ""n't"", 'enough', 'spoil', 'appreciation', 'what', 'essentially', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'Then', 'seeing', 'movie', 'obliquely', 'similar', 'theme', 'same', 'time', 'coincidentally', 'enhanced', 'appreciation', 'movies', 'even', 'more', 'want', 'see', 'film', 'subject', 'surveillance', 'recommend', 'Lives', 'Others', 'latter', 'German', 'film', 'surveillance', 'police', 'state', 'Coupled', 'Disturbia', 'surveillance', 'starting', 'out', 'giddy', 'teenage', 'entertainment', 'get', 'strangely', 'stereoscopic', 'effect', 'theme', 'watching', 'others', 'distance']",N/A

Then Kale's mother goes next door to ask that he not press any charges against Kale.  Kale snaps.  Has Kale gone off the deep end from cabin fever, or is what Kale has seen real?While the movie starts out a bit slow, the tension will slowly build as Kale's paranoia grows.  A typical plotline is saved by Morse's great acting.  One thing I didn't like is the filming of the ending scenes; they were filmed in such darkness that its hard to tell exactly what's going on and who is where in the room.

And he seems to have gotten into the same character for his roles in both films: a kind of missing link from Scooby Doo's gangScooby Doo, Where Are You! - The Complete First and Second Seasons.""Every killer lives next door to someone"" is the tagline on the movie poster, and the movie's trailer expands on the spoiler-tagline by coming right out with the detail of how a high school senior (LaBeouf) living under house-arrest discovers his neighbor is a serial killer. So all that's left untold for viewers in Disturbia is what LaBeeouf's character and friends do about it.Disturbia makes frequent attempts at humor, but most of the intended funny moments border on corny. The target audience of this movie clearly comes off as 13 - 24 year olds...the Scream crowdScream Trilogy - Boxed Set. But Disturbia is far from how well done the Scream films were done. Kids and young adults will find some of the humor in Disturbia amusing, but serious thriller fans will tire quickly of some of the campyness.There are some good, thrilling moments in Disturbia, but the suspense is lost in how predictable the movie is...especially after how much of the plot is deliberately given in advance to viewers that saw the trailer.Overall the movie was good, and the I-just-have-to-see-what-happens-next factor kept me interested enough to be entertained. But this weekend I also watched 2002's Scooby Doo - The MovieScooby-Doo (Widescreen Edition), and I found it much more entertaining than Disturbia, and Scooby Doo was even less predictable.

All of this doesn't mean disturbia is not worth watching. On the contrary, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it, and you may be as well.Shia will be onscreen almost constantly, so you have to be able to enjoy, or at least have no problems tolerating, his patented brand of befuddled charm.

Well if you can't, Disturbia will have a whole new generation peering out their windows, keeping a neighborhood watch on all of that suburban madness.Like Rear Window and The Burbs before it, Disturbia is a whodunit mystery that mixes humor, action and suspense when a group of obsessive neighbors believe that one of the local residents has been murdering beautiful girls in the night.Is it just their imaginations playing tricks on them or is a cold blooded killer really lurking next door? That is the question that director D.J. Caruso poses for the audience in this Hitchockian thriller. As Shia LaBeouf, the young star of Disturbia, falls into a panicked state of paranoia, so does the audience, allowing Caruso to capitalize on every bit of tension. While Caruso's previous efforts like Taking Lives and Two for the Money have been relatively bland and unsuccessful, thrills and chills seems to be an area the director succeeds in, accomplishing quite a few big scares with very little blood and violence.While parts of Disturbia certainly suggest the twisted horrors of gross out, exploitation flicks like Hostel and the Saw series, it successfully brings these concepts home to the eerie calm of suburbia without the over-the-top gore. Disturbia is all about tension, and rendering the film's lead character helpless within his home, under house arrest, is an ingenious update to the broken leg which kept the hero of Rear Window dependent on the investigation skills of others.While Disturbia seems to provide the role that will finally free LaBeouf of his Disney Channel past, it is the remainder of the film's young cast, Sarah Roemer and Aaron Yoo that share some of the budding star's spotlight. Though Aaron Yoo provides some great comic relief, and ""perhaps"" one of the best jump scares in the whole movie, it is the young, summer romance between Labeouf and Roemer that really gives the film a much needed credibility boost that separates it from other teeny bopper, horror pictures.When the mostly bikini clad, girl next door tempts LaBeouf with a kiss just outside of his house arrest perimeter, you can't help but feel teased too. When the duo finally does make their romantic connection it is a classic example of a slow build relationship coming together in an example of an iconic on screen kiss, perhaps the best between two young actors since The Girl Next Door.In an era where remakes and PG-13 horror films rarely ever meet even the lowest of expectations, Disturbia is a picture that defies these conventions. It is scary without being trite. It is funny without being campy. Most importantly, it doesn't damper Hitchcock's original concept. Disturbia lovingly updates the story for the Ipod generation to enjoy. Just when we thought it was safe to enjoy suburban life again, Caruso reminds audiences just how weird and exciting the mundane can truly be.

1083124,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B000RO6K80,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[0, 1]","One thing is sure.  ""Disturbia"" now joins ""Wrestling With Ernest Hemingway,"" ""The Saint of Fort Washington,"" and ""The Twonky"" as one of the worst titles ever.  Concocting a new word is an obvious attempt to create an aura of mystery over what is at heart a by-the-book melodrama.  Fortunately, the film itself is better than its dimwitted title suggests.""Disturbia"" is best described as a thriller, though the thriller part doesn't kick in until about halfway through the film.  The best thrillers have always been popular with audiences because they combine an intriguing story and charismatic characters with suspense, the ingredient that holds them together.  ""Disturbia"" follows that pattern.Kale (Shia LaBeouf) has been put under house arrest because he attacked his Spanish teacher.  The court orders that he remain confined to his house for three months.  A bracelet attached to his ankle monitors his movements in and immediately outside his home.  If he goes beyond a certain point, the police will be notified and they will come a-running.Initially, Kale vegetates, playing video games on his X-Box, watching TV, turning his room into a personal disaster area, eating globs of peanut butter drenched with chocolate syrup, and longing for contact with his friends.  Kale's mom (Carrie-Anne Moss) -- disgusted by the way Kale views his court-ordered incarceration as a romp -- cuts off his electronic entertainment, insisting that the vacation is over.With nothing else to do, Kale takes to watching his neighbors.  There's Mr. Turner (David Morse), whose habits are routinized and predictable; new move-in neighbors Ashley (Sarah Roemer) and her family; and a pack of unruly, irksome kids who delight in tormenting Kale.Once director D. J. Caruso establishes the characters and sets the plot in motion, he switches gears when Kale believes he's seen Mr. Turner engage in very suspicious behavior.  Kale involves best friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) and Ashley in his suspicions, placing all three of them in danger.""Disturbia"" owes much to Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window.""  In that film, Jimmy Stewart -- immobilized by a broken leg -- passes the time by spying on his neighbors when he believes he's seen evidence that a man across the courtyard has murdered his wife.""Disturbia"" scales down the characters to teenagers to attract a young audience, and that's fine.  And though Mr. LaBeouf is no Jimmy Stewart, he is a likable actor whose naturalness suggests a sort of Everyman teen.  Imperfect, troubled, shackled  -- both physically and parentally -- he must act against considerable odds to reveal the truth about a mild-mannered neighbor.La Beouf is effective as Kale, making ""Disturbia"" an enjoyable viewing experience.  His acting is natural, his mannerisms appropriate and thought-out. He projects arrogance, anger, nervousness, embarrassment or fear, as required, and does so believably.  Since he is not yet overly familiar to movie audiences, he registers as a real kid who gets himself into a situation that spins out of control.Morse continues his career as a sinister, threatening, dangerous individual as Mr. Turner.  Soft-spoken, with kind eyes, his menace is conveyed not through overtly but by deliberate, psychological terror.What disappointed me most about ""Disturbia"" is its very predictable third act, which follows the path of so many thrillers before it.

I'm the world's biggest Hitchcock fan, and well past my adolescent years, so I wasn't expecting a lot from a new flick that every critic in America said was ""REAR WINDOW with teens."" But this film actually works on its own merits, and the chief merit is Shia LaBeouf. I haven't been this impressed with a new talent since I saw Keisha Castle-Hughes in WHALE RIDER, or when I saw 15-year-old Matthew Broderick in the Broadway play, BRIGHTON BEACH MEMOIRS, some 25 years ago. This Shia guy is the real deal, and I have a feeling DISTURBIA will go down in the books as the film that really broke him out to a long, high-profile career.Older folks, take note: This is not your average ""teen thriller,"" nor is it a simple ripoff of Hitchcock. It is a clever,  exciting new entity, expertly directed by D. J. Caruso. And the young lead is a perfect combination of Jimmy Stewart in REAR WINDOW (in the first 75 minutes) and Jodie Foster in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS (in the final 30 minutes), and every bit as good as both of them.

Caruso, Disturbia (2007) is an engaging teen thriller, that has an attractive cast, and a story that kind of works until the writers try to get too cute.  With the main character trapped in a house gazing through a pair of binoculars, we have sort of a contemporary teenage twist on Rear Window, although with much more aggressive killer.Kale Brecht (Shia LaBeouf) is serving home detention for slugging his teacher.  The transmitter on an ankle bracelet, keeps the seventeen year old from leaving the boundaries of his suburban yard.  With lots of time on his hands, he takes to spying on his neighbors, particularly Ashley (Sarah Roemer), a hot blonde that has just moved in next door.  Before long Ashley, and Kale's friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) are engaged in the surveillance of neighbor Robert Turner (David Morse), a mysterious guy with strange habits, they suspect of being a serial killer.Big surprise, they are correct!  And Turner has the uncanny habit of popping up where you least expect, in the Brecht kitchen after helping Kale's mom Julie (Carrie Anne Moss) with car trouble, and later at the window of Ashley's car.  What happens is fairly predictable, but still suspenseful and funny.  Turner's home with its secret torture chamber and burial vault cellar, is too much to take seriously.  The killer's demise, while a little unsatisfying, is thankfully swift.Shia LaBeouf's (Transformers, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) performance is excellent, and his career seems to be on the fast track to stardom.  Hopefully Sarah Roemer will get involved in some better quality films.  Amazingly Aaron Yoo, 28 at the time, easily passes for a teenager.

He has to stay in his own house with a special device attached to his leg when Kale discovers that he may or may not be living next door to a notorious serial killer. But how can he prove it when his mother wouldn't listen and the police are unsympathetic? He can trust only his best friend Ronnie and a new girl (and love interest) Ashley.You will find the basic situation of ""Disturbia"" is too similar to that of ""Rear Window,"" in which James Stewart's hero is trapped in his room because of his broken leg, but that doesn't mean that ""Disturbia"" is a worthless clone of Hitchcock's masterpiece. Well, you may call it a rip-off, but ""Disturbia"" succeeds as thriller (not completely though) and it also has some really funny moments. The main characters, three teenagers in particular, are memorable, thanks to the fine acting from the stars Shia LaBeouf, Sarah Roemer and Aaron Yoo. If you say Shia LaBeouf is on his way to be a big star, yes, I think so too. The film is also shot with stylish camera, but not in the showy way.Sadly, like Director D. J. Caruso's previous films, ""Disturbia"" loses its narrative power in the final chapter where things happen in a more conventional way. Another disappointment for me is Carrie-Anne Moss, whose character as Kale's mother becomes a cipher in the film's second half. And at some point some characters behave in a too incredible way - David Morse's character, I think, talks too much - but maybe you find it differently.

Kale is 16 or 17 and obviously loves his dad very much.  A car behind them passes them driving recklessly and causes Kale to run into another car, lose control and flip the SUV.  Kale and his dad are injured but doing fine.  However, another oncoming car strikes their upside down SUV on the passenger side where Kale's dad is.  Kale gets out and runs around to the other side.  We, the audience, are spared seeing the dad but it is obvious from the expression on Kale's face that he is dead and it is not a pretty sight.  We go forward a year and Kale is in Spanish class at the end of the year and they are having an oral test.  Kale is obviously not paying attention and the teacher, Mr. Gutierrez, gets (in my opinion) a bit sarcastic with him and brings up Kale's dad.  Kale punches the teacher.  The teacher presses charges and Kale is put on 90 days house arrest.  He has to wear an ankle bracelet and can't go beyond 100 feet from the central monitor.  This means even the edges of his lot are not accessible on all sides.Kale's mom takes away his X-Box and his iTunes capability so Kale is very bored.  He sees new neighbors moving in and goes out as there is a blond, sexy girl he wants to meet.  He steps on dog doo that was set on fire by some neighborhood boys of 10 or so.  He is frustrated he cannot do anything to them.  Kale also has a friend Ronnie who comes over to help relieve his boredom.  Kale shows Ronnie from different sides of his room and the house how he can see his across the street neighbor, the neighbors  on each side of him (the blond girl on the one side and an older man, Mr. Turner, on the other) and behind.  Kale gets to meet Ashley, the girl next door, when he violates his 100 foot limit and the police come!Kale also watches TV a lot and sees a young woman is missing and the suspected vehicle that she left in is a blue 1960's Mustang with a dent on the left fender.  Mr. Turner has a blue 1960's Mustang with a dent on the left fender.How Kale watches his neighbors including Mr. Turner and gets Ronnie and Ashley involved in what may or may not be happening and the final climax is very well done.

He shows no obvious signs of the murder he has commited and he does his best to hide every shred of evidence against him, including his wife.Mr. Turner-A neighbor who acts like a nice guy, but really isn't. He just killed a woman and left a dent in his car. A dent, Kale can see very easily as can we. Then he kills another woman in his home after he is being searched for and where Kale can see the murder taking place. He isn't exactly subtle or smart when it comes to hiding the proof that he did it. In fact it is so obvious that it makes the movie less suspenseful. What does he do, wait til someone finds out his secret and kills them. Then he's left with another murder to not clean up.The story in ""Disturbia"" is just straight forward because we know everything and the film tries desperately to mirror Hitchcock. While ""Rear Window's"" story takes a while before everyone's convinced enough to try and catch the killer. It even comes to the point where the killer hides the evidence so well he has Jeff second-guessing his theory at one point. That is why Rear Winow works and Disturbia does not.",2,Disturbia vs. Rear Window,1184803200,"07 19, 2007",2007,2720,"['battle', 'two', 'movies', 'better', 'answer', 'hands', 'down', 'Rear', 'Window', 'face', 'Disturbia', 'may', 'be', 'updated', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'used', 'anechdotes', 'failed', 'horror', 'movies', 'today', '16', 'year-old', 'underdog', 'sexy', 'girl', 'mother', 'who', ""n't"", 'believe', 'boy', 'til', 'end', 'course', 'killer.Now', 'lets', 'observe', 'differences', 'critics', 'should', 'consider', 'Lead', 'Male', 'Character', 'Kale-a', 'boy', 'who', 'house', 'arrest', 'PUNCHING', 'OUT', 'HIS', 'TEACHER', ""'m"", 'correct', 'would', 'never', 'happen', 'reality', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'mommy', 'away', 'toys.Jeff-a', 'photographer', 'broken', 'leg', 'limited', 'mobility', 'accident', 'assignment', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'eat', 'drink', 'be', 'girlfriend', 'watch', 'neighbors', 'Much', 'more', 'believeableLead', 'Female', 'Character', 'Ashley-A', 'girl', 'who', 'next', 'door', 'Kale', 'feels', 'attracted', 'when', 'watching', 'strip', 'CREEPY', 'easily', 'Kale', 'when', 'neighbor', 'serial', 'killer', 'way.Lisa-A', 'sophisticated', 'model', 'who', 'Jeff', 'would', 'go', 'jungle', 'were', 'assigned', 'go', 'there', 'voyeurism', 'marry', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Jeff', 'neighbor', 'Mr.', 'Thorwald', 'first', 'something', 'cops', 'just', 'shrug', 'off', 'jewelry', 'Why', 'would', 'just', 'leave', 'jewelry', 'going', 'trip', 'strength', 'own', 'Jeff', 'access', 'Mr.', 'Thorwald', 'house.The', 'Killer', 'Mr.', 'Thorwald-A', 'salesman', 'who', 'married', 'wife', 'affair', 'having', 'wife', 'nagging', 'obvious', 'signs', 'murder', 'commited', 'best', 'hide', 'shred', 'evidence', 'including', 'wife.Mr', 'Turner-A', 'neighbor', 'who', 'nice', 'guy', 'really', ""n't"", 'just', 'killed', 'woman', 'left', 'dent', 'car', 'dent', 'Kale', 'can', 'see', 'very', 'easily', 'can', 'Then', 'woman', 'home', 'being', 'searched', 'where', 'Kale', 'can', 'see', 'murder', 'taking', 'place', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'subtle', 'smart', 'when', 'hiding', 'proof', 'did', 'fact', 'so', 'obvious', 'movie', 'less', 'suspenseful', 'What', 'do', 'wait', 'someone', 'out', 'secret', 'Then', 'left', 'murder', 'not', 'clean', 'up.The', 'story', 'Disturbia', 'just', 'straight', 'forward', 'know', 'everything', 'film', 'desperately', 'mirror', 'Hitchcock', 'Rear', 'Window', 'story', 'while', 'everyone', 'convinced', 'enough', 'try', 'catch', 'killer', 'even', 'point', 'where', 'killer', 'evidence', 'so', 'well', 'Jeff', 'second-guessing', 'theory', 'one', 'point', 'why', 'Rear', 'Winow', 'works', 'Disturbia', 'not']",N/A

It's my favorite movie ever!"" As soon as it came out, I immediately drove to Blockbuster to rent a copy. Sadly, a rental is all Disturbia is worth.The premise of the movie amused me at first: a kid (Shia LaBeouf) is under house arrest because he punched one of his teachers, and he suspects that his neighbor is a serial killer. It sounds like a formula for success...but wait: they have to throw in a cheesy romance side-story and a handful of useless scenes that do nothing to progress the main plot. I won't give away the ending, but it is so utterly predictable and disappointing, not to mention there is a fight that takes place in the dark where I couldn't see anything that was happening (probably to tone the violence and blood down to keep the rating at a PG-13 level for the tweens.)

1083138,AP3B615GM191G,B000RO6K80,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 2]","When evaluated as the thriller it is advertised to be, ""Disturbia"" is slightly above average, providing just enough drama/suspense to keep viewers interested.  However, add in the incredible acting of Shia LaBeouf, and the film easily jumps up into the ""very solid"" category.For a basic plot summary, ""Disturbia"" very loosely follows the premise of Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"".  In this case, young Kale (LaBeouf) is confined to house arrest after slugging a teacher.  While homebound, Kale enlists the help of friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) and new-to-town girlfriend Ashley (Sarah Roemer) to spy on the next-door-neighbor Mr. Turner (David Morse), who they believe to be a serial killer.As I mentioned in the opener, as a ""thriller"" alone this movie is passable.  If you a veteran of the genre you'll likely know what is coming, but otherwise it is still watchable.  Some may deride the effort as a ""Hitchcock rip-off"", but it should instead be viewed as a ""Hitchcock re-interpretation"" for the younger generation (the ones who have no interest in watching Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly).The hallmark of the experience, though, is easily the acting of LaBeouf, who (as he so often did during that time period) represents the typical American teenage boy.  He struggles with the utter boredom of house arrest, spies on the bikini-clad teenage girl across the yard (and then befriends her in his awkward way), and then lets himself get completely swept up in a fantastical plot involving Mr. Turner.  These are all things that teenagers can relate to (or even older folks can remember relating to!) and make the movie much more personal to the viewer.Thus, while it is still quite possible that Mr. LaBeouf will go on to have a long and successful acting career, ""Disturbia"" will always represent his peak of teenage-themed flicks (right along with ""Holes"" & ""Transformers"").  Watch for that incredible acting or the suspense.  Either way, you'll finding something to enjoy out of this one.",4,When Shia LaBeouf Ruled The Teenage World,1345939200,"08 26, 2012",2012,1990,"['When', 'evaluated', 'thriller', 'advertised', 'be', 'Disturbia', 'slightly', 'above', 'average', 'providing', 'just', 'enough', 'drama/suspense', 'keep', 'viewers', 'interested', 'However', 'add', 'incredible', 'acting', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'film', 'easily', 'up', 'very', 'solid', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Disturbia', 'very', 'loosely', 'premise', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Rear', 'Window', 'case', 'young', 'Kale', 'LaBeouf', 'confined', 'house', 'arrest', 'slugging', 'teacher', 'homebound', 'Kale', 'help', 'friend', 'Ronnie', 'Aaron', 'Yoo', 'new-to-town', 'girlfriend', 'Ashley', 'Sarah', 'Roemer', 'spy', 'next-door-neighbor', 'Mr.', 'Turner', 'David', 'Morse', 'who', 'believe', 'be', 'serial', 'killer.As', 'mentioned', 'opener', 'thriller', 'alone', 'movie', 'passable', 'veteran', 'genre', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'know', 'what', 'coming', 'still', 'watchable', 'may', 'deride', 'effort', 'Hitchcock', 'rip-off', 'should', 'instead', 'be', 'viewed', 'Hitchcock', 're-interpretation', 'younger', 'generation', 'ones', 'who', 'have', 'interest', 'watching', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'Grace', 'Kelly', '.The', 'hallmark', 'experience', 'easily', 'acting', 'LaBeouf', 'who', 'so', 'often', 'did', 'time', 'period', 'typical', 'American', 'teenage', 'boy', 'utter', 'boredom', 'house', 'arrest', 'spies', 'bikini-clad', 'teenage', 'girl', 'yard', 'then', 'awkward', 'way', 'then', 'get', 'completely', 'swept', 'up', 'fantastical', 'plot', 'involving', 'Mr.', 'Turner', 'are', 'things', 'teenagers', 'can', 'relate', 'even', 'older', 'folks', 'can', 'remember', 'relating', 'make', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'personal', 'viewer.Thus', 'still', 'quite', 'possible', 'Mr.', 'LaBeouf', 'will', 'go', 'have', 'long', 'successful', 'acting', 'career', 'Disturbia', 'will', 'always', 'represent', 'peak', 'teenage-themed', 'flicks', 'right', 'Holes', 'Transformers', 'Watch', 'incredible', 'acting', 'suspense', 'way', ""'ll"", 'finding', 'something', 'enjoy', 'one']",N/A
