This is the first film that actually makes something absolutely and completely real, and gives it the same qualities as the scripted films. This film takes you from a predeployment party in Denmark, to brutal firefights in Afghanistan. It provides a real life window into the lives, dilemma, and heartache of soldiers still in their teens. Masterfully shot and impeccably edited this is a truly amazing film and stands alone in concept and execution. This DVD is fantastic.

1453507,A1KIQ4P4ZW3ALF,B005C7HL30,G. Teslovich,"[5, 8]","This Danish military in Afghanistan documentary did not shy away from showing what we don't want to see. Having grown up with guns and killing for sport, later replaced by ROTC, I understand the biologically determined thrill of the hunt and for those who live in a sheltered urban environment it's surrogate in film/TV and PC/video gaming. Armadillo shows us how technology and killing at a distance has removed the human element from the act of killing thus transforming it into another form of a video game. The recent news video of pissing on Taliban is made more understandable in this film as both the conditioned unemotional training for reactive killing as well as the subsequent dehumanizing changes that are enhanced by combat. Nothing new there; it's as old as being human. But then again if one tallies all the reasons why people kill then combat is just the same, just a different venue.Additionally, we see how the lack of education coupled with conservative religious indoctrination amongst the Afghan peoples leads to narrow simplistic views of life and a distrust of anything/anyone different (not unlike the comparable Christian conservatives). Also shown was how the Taliban are able to successfully manipulate the battlefield rules both in terms of the minds of the local population and in their hit and run tactics thus drawing the foreigners into fighting the people they are trying to protect.",5,Parallels,1326499200,"01 14, 2012",2012,1416,"['Danish', 'military', 'Afghanistan', 'documentary', 'did', 'not', 'shy', 'away', 'showing', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'Having', 'grown', 'up', 'guns', 'killing', 'sport', 'later', 'replaced', 'ROTC', 'understand', 'biologically', 'determined', 'thrill', 'hunt', 'who', 'live', 'sheltered', 'urban', 'environment', 'surrogate', 'film/TV', 'PC/video', 'gaming', 'Armadillo', 'how', 'technology', 'killing', 'distance', 'removed', 'human', 'element', 'act', 'killing', 'thus', 'transforming', 'form', 'video', 'game', 'recent', 'news', 'video', 'pissing', 'Taliban', 'made', 'more', 'understandable', 'film', 'conditioned', 'unemotional', 'training', 'reactive', 'killing', 'as', 'well', 'subsequent', 'dehumanizing', 'changes', 'are', 'enhanced', 'combat', 'Nothing', 'new', 'there', 'as', 'old', 'being', 'human', 'then', 'again', 'one', 'reasons', 'why', 'people', 'kill', 'then', 'combat', 'just', 'same', 'just', 'different', 'venue.Additionally', 'see', 'how', 'lack', 'education', 'coupled', 'conservative', 'religious', 'indoctrination', 'Afghan', 'peoples', 'narrow', 'simplistic', 'views', 'life', 'distrust', 'anything/anyone', 'different', 'not', 'comparable', 'Christian', 'conservatives', 'Also', 'shown', 'was', 'how', 'Taliban', 'are', 'able', 'successfully', 'manipulate', 'battlefield', 'rules', 'terms', 'minds', 'local', 'population', 'hit', 'run', 'tactics', 'thus', 'drawing', 'foreigners', 'fighting', 'people', 'are', 'trying', 'protect']",N/A
1453508,A2COCRWXXUQI8G,B005C7HL30,J. Bradley,"[0, 0]","""Armadillo"" - compared to 2010's ""Restrepo"" - really has some of the most intense battle action of the crop of Iraq/Afghanistan war documentaries of the Iraq/Afghan Wars era. The interesting thing is this movie follows DANISH soldiers, serving there as part of ISAF, who are stationed at a base - called Armadillo - in southern Afghanistan. In many cases they - and we - see the Taliban, from the viewpoint of the little radio-controlled drone airplane that they launch by hand daily, and we see the soldiers go on patrol and confront them in the nearby villages. Also too we see them contronting the local dwellers of those villages in sit-down meetings where they protest ""You bombed my field."" ""You bombed my cow"". ""You bombed my house."" ""They don't shoot at you, they come and kill US!"" And they pay the villagers 1500 dollars for their losses. Ideally, I DO kinda' wish they could have done almost a reality show type approach - with cameras just EVERYWHERE shooting EVERYTHING and editing it all together so as to tell more of the story of this place and the people there. As it is, it's as much as could be done by the director and the camera man - who actually gets shot at one point - getting what they do, and it's still quite A LOT, and it illuminates a great deal of the experience of the war there. It's really an intense snapshot, but at the same time you realize this is just one little piece of what went on there and there's more intense stuff that's never been recorded.",4,The most intense snapshot of the war in Afghanistan.,1323388800,"12 9, 2011",2011,1488,"['Armadillo', 'compared', '2010', 'Restrepo', 'really', 'most', 'intense', 'battle', 'action', 'crop', 'Iraq/Afghanistan', 'war', 'documentaries', 'Iraq/Afghan', 'Wars', 'era', 'interesting', 'thing', 'movie', 'DANISH', 'soldiers', 'serving', 'there', 'part', 'ISAF', 'who', 'are', 'stationed', 'base', 'called', 'Armadillo', 'southern', 'Afghanistan', 'many', 'cases', 'see', 'Taliban', 'viewpoint', 'little', 'radio-controlled', 'drone', 'airplane', 'launch', 'hand', 'daily', 'see', 'soldiers', 'go', 'patrol', 'confront', 'nearby', 'villages', 'Also', 'too', 'see', 'contronting', 'local', 'dwellers', 'villages', 'sit-down', 'meetings', 'where', 'protest', 'bombed', 'field', 'bombed', 'cow', 'bombed', 'house', 'do', ""n't"", 'shoot', 'come', 'kill', 'pay', 'villagers', '1500', 'dollars', 'losses', 'Ideally', 'DO', 'kinda', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'almost', 'reality', 'show', 'type', 'approach', 'cameras', 'just', 'EVERYWHERE', 'shooting', 'EVERYTHING', 'editing', 'together', 'so', 'tell', 'more', 'story', 'place', 'people', 'there', 'as', 'much', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'director', 'camera', 'man', 'who', 'actually', 'shot', 'one', 'point', 'getting', 'what', 'do', 'still', 'quite', 'A', 'LOT', 'great', 'deal', 'experience', 'war', 'there', 'really', 'intense', 'snapshot', 'same', 'time', 'realize', 'just', 'one', 'little', 'piece', 'what', 'went', 'more', 'intense', 'stuff', 'never', 'been', 'recorded']",N/A
1453509,AGGP8FKBFDHL1,B005C7HL30,Jonathan Weller,"[0, 0]","&#34;Armadillo&#34; is the documentary story of a unit of Danish trooped who are deployed on a six month tour of Afghanistan at......you guessed it, a firebase called: Armadillo. The movie flows well from departing loved ones at home, to the boredom of deployment, to the actual combat experiences of the men in country. My own quip about this movie is, most of the men are portrayed as being jokesters about war and death (or porn hounds), and anyone who has ever served knows soldiers don't look at war in any way as a joking matter.This film actually surprised me when I first watched it. I was expecting something of an anti-war docudrama about how terrible the &#34;Evil Empire&#34; of the U.S. currently is, but interestingly enough, it was a well thought out film about the trials and experiences of everyday Danish troops. I knew very little about Denmark's involvement in Afghanistan before this movie (I actually didn't know they even had troops over there), but the movie does a great job of introducing these allies and they acquit themselves very well. The film does tend to make light of the harshness of war, but I believe that troops deal with stress in many different ways. The battle scenes were incredibly well shot, and you actually feel like you have just been in a firefight! The movie also does a stupendous job of showing exactly why Afghanistan will never be conquered or be made to conform to western thinking. This nation simply does not want westerners interfering with their lives, and eventually I'd imagine the U.S. and its allies will have to wake up and take notice as well.I really enjoyed the movie throughout.

Their primary mission is to provide security to the area and to curtail the influence of Taliban, but performing their task in reality turns out more dangerous and complicated than expected.Director Janus Metz's film captures what the frontline soldiers have to face.

And you just cannot tell civilians from Talibans.The documentary film is notable for its editing skills that are so slick and tactful that the combats with the Taliban soldiers start to look like scenes from Hollywood movies.
