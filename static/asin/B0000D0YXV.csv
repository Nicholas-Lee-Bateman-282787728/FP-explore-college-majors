776880,AM18CU72YEWH5,B0000D0YXV,A. J Terry,"[4, 5]","I'm a great fan of _Jane Eyre_ but have not read _Wide Sargasso Sea_, though reviewers of the film say the book is better.This could have been an excellent character film, showing how Rochester exaggerated his relationship with his wife ""Bertha"" to Jane. Was Mason the brother-in-law mad, and passing a hereditary madness on to ""Bertha""?  No, he and his brother (the one who married Antoinette/Bertha's widowed mother) were not only not even her biological relatives, they were merely dips. Was Antoinette's mother mad?  According to Antoinette's account, merely grief-stricken, alcoholic, sexy, and socially inconvenient--hence, locked up by the men who had legal power over her.  And why should Rochester believe the statements of Daniel the half-brother?  First, Daniel is an extortionist. Second, his revelation that Antoinette's father had affairs with his slaves is deeply shocking to Rochester, who somehow blames it on Antoinette. While I'm not condoning it, many other slaveowners did the same, so it would hardly have shocked a period Jamaican. Rochester, in fact, consistently refuses to accept Jamaica--he's constantly complaining about the climate, doesn't understand the racial tensions, and so on.Still, Rochester's character could have been developed more deeply. As for Antoinette, she's merely a one-dimensional ""child of nature,"" devoted to long sleeps, sex, and an enjoyment of the sultry climate. Given that after her parents' death she seems to have been brought up in a Catholic boarding school, she should display more in the way of education, social graces, and well, character. A more rounded character would make Antoinette far more sympathetic. As it is, the viewer is tempted to side with Rochester in wanting a wife who is interested in more than sex.And one thing that would have been far more powerful, is establishing Antoinette as locked up by Rochester merely as an inconvenience, an alcoholic wife who doesn't understand British culture. One scene with Rochester urging/paying a doctor to certify Antoinette as mad no matter what, would have done this beautifully.Other than that, although Nathaniel Parker doesn't look bad in the nude, Antoinette is too scrawny (and seems unable to do anything with her hair other than a modern pageboy style, for in bed or out of it). In summary, the film would be far better with more emphasis on character and less on sex. I will say that the actors doing Afro-Haitian dance actually do it well, unlike the ludicrously stiff and unpractised attempts at walzing done by the actors playing British characters. Also, the scenery is gorgeous.",3,Would be improved by more character development,1208304000,"04 16, 2008",2008,2612,"[""'m"", 'great', 'fan', '_Jane', 'Eyre_', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'Sargasso', 'Sea_', 'reviewers', 'film', 'say', 'book', 'better.This', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'excellent', 'character', 'film', 'showing', 'how', 'Rochester', 'exaggerated', 'relationship', 'wife', 'Bertha', 'Jane', 'Was', 'Mason', 'brother-in-law', 'mad', 'passing', 'hereditary', 'madness', 'Bertha', 'No', 'brother', 'one', 'who', 'married', 'Antoinette/Bertha', 'widowed', 'mother', 'were', 'not', 'only', 'not', 'even', 'biological', 'relatives', 'were', 'merely', 'dips', 'Was', 'Antoinette', 'mother', 'mad', 'According', 'Antoinette', 'account', 'merely', 'grief-stricken', 'alcoholic', 'sexy', 'socially', 'inconvenient', 'hence', 'locked', 'up', 'men', 'who', 'had', 'legal', 'power', 'why', 'should', 'Rochester', 'believe', 'statements', 'Daniel', 'half-brother', 'First', 'Daniel', 'extortionist', 'Second', 'revelation', 'Antoinette', 'father', 'had', 'affairs', 'slaves', 'deeply', 'shocking', 'Rochester', 'who', 'somehow', 'Antoinette', ""'m"", 'not', 'condoning', 'many', 'other', 'slaveowners', 'did', 'same', 'would', 'hardly', 'have', 'shocked', 'period', 'Jamaican', 'Rochester', 'fact', 'consistently', 'accept', 'Jamaica', 'constantly', 'complaining', 'climate', ""n't"", 'understand', 'racial', 'tensions', 'so', 'on.Still', 'Rochester', 'character', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'developed', 'more', 'deeply', 'Antoinette', 'merely', 'one-dimensional', 'child', 'nature', 'devoted', 'long', 'sleeps', 'sex', 'enjoyment', 'sultry', 'climate', 'Given', 'parents', 'death', 'have', 'been', 'brought', 'up', 'Catholic', 'boarding', 'school', 'should', 'display', 'more', 'way', 'education', 'social', 'graces', 'well', 'character', 'more', 'rounded', 'character', 'would', 'make', 'Antoinette', 'far', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'viewer', 'tempted', 'side', 'Rochester', 'wanting', 'wife', 'who', 'interested', 'more', 'sex.And', 'one', 'thing', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'more', 'powerful', 'establishing', 'Antoinette', 'locked', 'up', 'Rochester', 'merely', 'inconvenience', 'alcoholic', 'wife', 'who', ""n't"", 'understand', 'British', 'culture', 'One', 'scene', 'Rochester', 'urging/paying', 'doctor', 'certify', 'Antoinette', 'mad', 'matter', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'beautifully.Other', 'Nathaniel', 'Parker', ""n't"", 'look', 'bad', 'nude', 'Antoinette', 'too', 'scrawny', 'unable', 'do', 'anything', 'hair', 'other', 'modern', 'pageboy', 'style', 'bed', 'summary', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'far', 'better', 'more', 'emphasis', 'character', 'less', 'sex', 'will', 'say', 'actors', 'doing', 'Afro-Haitian', 'dance', 'actually', 'do', 'well', 'ludicrously', 'stiff', 'unpractised', 'attempts', 'walzing', 'done', 'actors', 'playing', 'British', 'characters', 'Also', 'scenery', 'gorgeous']",N/A
776881,AC3064RV9PV62,B0000D0YXV,"A. Masion ""history lover and realist""","[6, 9]","For the record I've never read ""Wide Sargasso Sea"" although I've read ""Jane Eyre"" quite a few times.  I've always figured Edward Rochester was a bad man.  Every relationship he had with women before his involvement with Jane ended badly.  With one lunatic wife and one dead mistress...Well...I admit to feeling equal parts awe and disappointment with this film.  It wasn't that the erotic excesses offended me; I just felt less attention to erotic love scenes and more attention to the rather heavy themes in story would have made things more interesting.The movie is not consistent with Rochester's portrayal in Jane Eyre or his explanations of his marriage to Antoinette.  The implication is that Antoinette was descended from lunatics and was also a notorious adulteress (there were even hints her insanity was the result of syphilis in ""Jane Eyre"").  Antoinette's brother in the novel, Richard Mason, is completely eliminated as a character.In the movie, Antoinette is presented as a lonely orphan with no close family to cover up her alleged madness and ""vices"".There are other inconsistencies that just stray too far from Rochester's explanations as well as Bronte's novel to keep a true Bronte fan engaged.Antoinette and Amelie are two-dimensional characters, competing for the sexual favors of Antoinette's loser husband who doesn't particularly like or respect either one of them.It looks like the brains behind the film could not decide whether Edward Rochester was a racist libertine or a victim of circumstance. The balance is tipped by saddistic behavior (i.e., killing animals and brutalizing his young wife.)  He is basically a fortune-hunter who does not hesitate to despise his wife's cultural differences once he's acquired her wealth and properties.I think the writers hoped to create a theme of Black/African female empowerment by having Amelie seduce Rochester, then accept a gift of money from him and walk out of his life to become a whore.Also, it is never clear to me when/how Antoinette went mad.  She does not strike me as mad or even unstable in the course of the film although she does portray classic alcoholism and depression after her husband's abandonment.  Surely no one presumes she is psychopathic because she tried to club Rochester with with a glass bottle and spit in his face after he had loud noisy sex with Amelie just outside her bedroom!Even the portrayal of Daniel Cosway is sort of weird.  One minute he appears to be affectionate towards Antoinette (his half-sister) and the next he is bound and determined to do everything he possibly can to ruin her marriage and destroy any opportunity for her happiness.The two actresses who portray Aunt Cora and Christophine deliver solid performances and Lombard does her best with her role and makes the most of her improbable lingerie (midriff-baring camisoles were not around in 1840.)The film has lush beautiful scenes and an almost fantasy quality about it and costume quality is good except for inaccutate lingerie. I think it's best to watch and appreciate the film for what it is and not worry too much about accuracy with its actual novel or Jane Eyre.  As an erotic romance gone bad it's a keeper.",3,"I tried, but I really couldn't understand.",1134432000,"12 13, 2005",2005,3194,"['record', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'Wide', 'Sargasso', 'Sea', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'quite', 'few', 'times', ""'ve"", 'always', 'figured', 'Edward', 'Rochester', 'was', 'bad', 'man', 'relationship', 'had', 'women', 'involvement', 'Jane', 'ended', 'badly', 'one', 'lunatic', 'wife', 'one', 'dead', 'mistress', 'Well', 'admit', 'feeling', 'equal', 'parts', 'awe', 'disappointment', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'erotic', 'excesses', 'offended', 'just', 'felt', 'less', 'attention', 'erotic', 'love', 'scenes', 'more', 'attention', 'rather', 'heavy', 'themes', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'things', 'more', 'interesting.The', 'movie', 'not', 'consistent', 'Rochester', 'portrayal', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'explanations', 'marriage', 'Antoinette', 'implication', 'Antoinette', 'was', 'descended', 'lunatics', 'was', 'also', 'notorious', 'adulteress', 'were', 'even', 'insanity', 'was', 'result', 'syphilis', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'Antoinette', 'brother', 'novel', 'Richard', 'Mason', 'completely', 'eliminated', 'character.In', 'movie', 'Antoinette', 'presented', 'lonely', 'orphan', 'close', 'family', 'cover', 'up', 'alleged', 'madness', 'vices', 'are', 'other', 'inconsistencies', 'just', 'stray', 'too', 'far', 'Rochester', 'explanations', 'as', 'well', 'Bronte', 'novel', 'keep', 'true', 'Bronte', 'fan', 'engaged.Antoinette', 'Amelie', 'are', 'two-dimensional', 'characters', 'competing', 'sexual', 'favors', 'Antoinette', 'loser', 'husband', 'who', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'like', 'respect', 'one', 'them.It', 'looks', 'brains', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'decide', 'Edward', 'Rochester', 'was', 'racist', 'libertine', 'victim', 'circumstance', 'balance', 'tipped', 'saddistic', 'behavior', 'i.e.', 'killing', 'animals', 'brutalizing', 'young', 'wife', 'basically', 'fortune-hunter', 'who', 'not', 'hesitate', 'despise', 'wife', 'cultural', 'differences', 'once', 'acquired', 'wealth', 'properties.I', 'think', 'writers', 'hoped', 'create', 'theme', 'Black/African', 'female', 'empowerment', 'having', 'Amelie', 'seduce', 'Rochester', 'then', 'accept', 'gift', 'money', 'walk', 'life', 'become', 'whore.Also', 'never', 'clear', 'when/how', 'Antoinette', 'went', 'mad', 'not', 'strike', 'mad', 'even', 'unstable', 'course', 'film', 'portray', 'classic', 'alcoholism', 'depression', 'husband', 'abandonment', 'Surely', 'one', 'psychopathic', 'tried', 'club', 'Rochester', 'glass', 'bottle', 'spit', 'face', 'had', 'loud', 'noisy', 'sex', 'Amelie', 'just', 'bedroom', 'Even', 'portrayal', 'Daniel', 'Cosway', 'sort', 'weird', 'One', 'minute', 'be', 'affectionate', 'towards', 'Antoinette', 'half-sister', 'next', 'bound', 'determined', 'do', 'everything', 'possibly', 'can', 'ruin', 'marriage', 'destroy', 'opportunity', 'happiness.The', 'two', 'actresses', 'who', 'portray', 'Aunt', 'Cora', 'Christophine', 'deliver', 'solid', 'performances', 'Lombard', 'best', 'role', 'most', 'improbable', 'lingerie', 'midriff-baring', 'camisoles', 'were', 'not', 'around', '1840', 'film', 'lush', 'beautiful', 'scenes', 'almost', 'fantasy', 'quality', 'costume', 'quality', 'good', 'inaccutate', 'lingerie', 'think', 'best', 'watch', 'appreciate', 'film', 'what', 'not', 'worry', 'too', 'much', 'accuracy', 'actual', 'novel', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'erotic', 'romance', 'gone', 'bad', 'keeper']",N/A

776886,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B0000D0YXV,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[18, 23]","There's lots of passion in Wide Sargasso Sea THE BOOK, but it's mostly emotional. It's an extremely multi-layered novel and the work of a true master. The film on the other hand is just your classic, bad 1990s film, beautiful to look at, with lots of skin, languid copulation, heaving bosoms, bodice-ripping nonsense, etc and next to no substance. It has no artistic integrity whatsoever, as its shameless makers must surely know they lifted their middle finger at the spirit of the Jean Rhys novel when choosing to make the film the way they did.I was unable to feel empathy for both the lead character. The much touted erotic scenes were not developed to what they lead to believe, and it also lacked much enthusiasm. They were incomplete and contributed little, if anything, to the plot. The viewer only gets a glimpse of the passion that supposedly exists between Edward and Antoinette. Therefore, they should have either gone all the way, tastefully (no pun intended), or have left those scenes out entirely.Now with regards to the plot of this film there were enormous holes, which perhaps could be rectified by reading the book. But for those who haven't read the book, there should be enough information in the film itself to keep the reader afloat. From the start it was unclear what was really going on with this family (despite the narration). Why did the ex-slaves keep laughing? (Something vaguely explained in the movie, though apparently fully explained in the book). Why didn't the parrot fly away? What made the mother go nuts? At no point in the movie were Mr. Rochester's ""issues"", as it were, fully explained. The man gets a letter exposing his wife as a Creole and dumps her like a hot potato, after (as Christophene explains) he was the one who came crawling to her in the first place. What a hypocrite. Again, maybe this is the ultimate point, that Mr. Rochester is a snob and the archetypical Victorian Englishman and that Antoinette is the victim of both his prejudice and that of the Jamaicans. But none of that exonerates the appallingly abrupt conclusion to the film.So, despite the beautiful cinematography, this movie is a hopeless muddle. I'd highly recommend the novel by the way: a book you don't forget in a hurry. Needless to say I think you should give this insulting (to the memory of Jean Rhys) film a miss, especially if you've read the novel: it'll just frustrate you, no matter how keen on a bit of easy titillation you may be feeling at the time.",2,This film was not faithful to the adaptation of the novel.,1151452800,"06 28, 2006",2006,2488,"['lots', 'passion', 'Wide', 'Sargasso', 'Sea', 'THE', 'BOOK', 'mostly', 'emotional', 'extremely', 'multi-layered', 'novel', 'work', 'true', 'master', 'film', 'other', 'hand', 'just', 'classic', 'bad', '1990s', 'film', 'beautiful', 'look', 'lots', 'skin', 'languid', 'copulation', 'heaving', 'bosoms', 'bodice-ripping', 'nonsense', 'etc', 'next', 'substance', 'artistic', 'integrity', 'whatsoever', 'shameless', 'makers', 'must', 'surely', 'know', 'lifted', 'middle', 'finger', 'spirit', 'Jean', 'Rhys', 'novel', 'when', 'choosing', 'make', 'film', 'way', 'did.I', 'was', 'unable', 'feel', 'empathy', 'lead', 'character', 'much', 'touted', 'erotic', 'scenes', 'were', 'not', 'developed', 'what', 'lead', 'believe', 'also', 'lacked', 'much', 'enthusiasm', 'were', 'incomplete', 'contributed', 'little', 'anything', 'plot', 'viewer', 'only', 'glimpse', 'passion', 'supposedly', 'Edward', 'Antoinette', 'Therefore', 'should', 'have', 'gone', 'way', 'tastefully', 'pun', 'intended', 'have', 'left', 'scenes', 'out', 'entirely.Now', 'regards', 'plot', 'film', 'were', 'enormous', 'holes', 'perhaps', 'could', 'be', 'rectified', 'reading', 'book', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'should', 'be', 'enough', 'information', 'film', 'keep', 'reader', 'afloat', 'start', 'was', 'unclear', 'what', 'was', 'really', 'going', 'family', 'narration', 'Why', 'did', 'ex-slaves', 'keep', 'laughing', 'Something', 'vaguely', 'explained', 'movie', 'though', 'apparently', 'fully', 'explained', 'book', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'parrot', 'fly', 'away', 'What', 'made', 'mother', 'go', 'nuts', 'point', 'movie', 'were', 'Mr.', 'Rochester', 'issues', 'were', 'fully', 'explained', 'man', 'letter', 'exposing', 'wife', 'Creole', 'dumps', 'hot', 'potato', 'Christophene', 'was', 'one', 'who', 'came', 'crawling', 'first', 'place', 'What', 'hypocrite', 'Again', 'maybe', 'ultimate', 'point', 'Mr.', 'Rochester', 'snob', 'archetypical', 'Victorian', 'Englishman', 'Antoinette', 'victim', 'prejudice', 'Jamaicans', 'none', 'appallingly', 'abrupt', 'conclusion', 'film.So', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'movie', 'hopeless', 'muddle', ""'d"", 'highly', 'recommend', 'novel', 'way', 'book', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'hurry', 'Needless', 'say', 'think', 'should', 'give', 'insulting', 'memory', 'Jean', 'Rhys', 'film', 'miss', 'especially', ""'ve"", 'read', 'novel', ""'ll"", 'just', 'frustrate', 'matter', 'how', 'keen', 'bit', 'easy', 'titillation', 'may', 'be', 'feeling', 'time']",N/A

Devil's Advocate: Jean Rhys' novel is incredibly complex with various narrators and perspectives, and I believe that *any* attempt to translate it onto film would have resulted in disaster.On the other hand, this movie is terrible, I don't even think they were *trying* to make a movie version of _Wide Sargasso Sea_ I think they just took the characters as laid out by Rhys and ran with a story of their own; case in point, the childhood of Antoinette is almost glazed over so the director could rush right into naked shots of Karina Lombard playing Antoinette as an adult. The book employs an intricate narration system and the voice-overs in the movie are stilted, stupid and simple which robs Rhys of her literary purpose.I think casting Karina Lombard was initially a good choice; she definitely looks the part of a Creole, but the former model could not handle the emotional depth which Antoinette requires and by the end of the movie you're hoping for a love scene so she can just shut up.Nathaniel Parker (just wonderful in ""Hamlet"" and ""Othello"") seems to have wasted his talents here-though we do get a good cheap thrill about midway through the movie, but he just seems too wrong as Rochester: too reserved, too eloquent, too skinny, too stiff, his transition from Antoinette's husband into despotic English Lord is too quick the transition looses its meaning.Still and all; the scenery is breath-taking, the music is haunting, the love scenes are, well, let's say ""realistic"" so if you're looking for good literary ""stimulation"" I would check it out.

(One wishes the same could be said of Naomi Watts, who has a small part here, but one can't have everything.) The story itself is about as riveting as... well, let's put it this way. It's a prequel to Jane Eyre. They share a certain leisure of plot.Once Michael York's scenery-chewing is out of the way (he plays Antoinette's father, and is only seen in the scenes where she's young), the film settles down into a nice, quiet lull for the rest of its length. The scenery is beautiful, the bodies are beautiful, it's like Winged Migration with nudity and an attempt at a storyline. ** ",3,"Pretty, but vapid.",1070236800,"12 1, 2003",2003,1345,"['Wide', 'Sargasso', 'Sea', 'John', 'Duigan', '1993', 'John', 'Duigan', 'who', 'aggressively', 'indie', 'films', 'got', 'most', 'notoriety', 'career', 'adaptation', 'Jean', 'Rhys', 'prequel', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'very', 'pretty', 'thing', 'be', 'sure', 'really-how', 'much', 'can', 'expect', 'film', 'made', 'mid-eighties', 'up', 'casting', 'Michael', 'York', 'Let', 'face', 'main', 'reason', 'watch', 'Wide', 'Sargasso', 'Sea', 'Antioniette', 'Karina', 'Lombard', 'biggest', 'role', 'been', 'Kull', 'Conqueror', 'Amelie', 'Rowena', 'King', 'most', 'recently', 'seen', 'Proof', 'Life', 'who', 'are', 'battling', 'affections', 'Antoinette', 'husband', 'Edward', 'Nathaniel', 'Parker', 'days', 'are', 'occupied', 'making', 'Inspector', 'Lynley', 'mysteries', 'presently', 'spend', 'whole', 'lot', 'screen', 'time', 'unclothed', 'One', 'same', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'who', 'small', 'part', 'here', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'everything', 'story', 'about', 'as', 'riveting', 'well', 'let', 'put', 'way', 'prequel', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'share', 'certain', 'leisure', 'plot.Once', 'Michael', 'York', 'scenery-chewing', 'way', 'Antoinette', 'father', 'only', 'seen', 'scenes', 'where', 'young', 'film', 'down', 'nice', 'quiet', 'lull', 'rest', 'length', 'scenery', 'beautiful', 'bodies', 'are', 'beautiful', 'Winged', 'Migration', 'nudity', 'attempt', 'storyline', '**']",N/A

You get the young Rochester, and this time around his pre-crazy wife is shown completely sympathetically, like a victim of his insensitivity rather than the curse hidden away (that he had to bear due to fate alone).  In my opinion, this adds depth to the characters.  It is easy, of course, to interpret her insanity as inevitable, but I saw it as a role that was created for her in the marriage, and it didn't need to be that way - Rochester allowed it to happen, even participated in it, and so bears some responsibility; he then abandons her once a better life-style opportunity arises.  Also, the film stands very well on its own; it was only after I saw it that I realized it was the characters from Bronte.  The acting is very good, particularly Lombard.Warmly recommended.",4,nice prequel to Jane Eyre,1168646400,"01 13, 2007",2007,853,"['Many', 'reviewers', 'here', 'did', 'not', 'found', 'quite', 'interesting', 'get', 'young', 'Rochester', 'time', 'pre-crazy', 'wife', 'shown', 'completely', 'sympathetically', 'victim', 'insensitivity', 'rather', 'curse', 'hidden', 'away', 'had', 'bear', 'due', 'fate', 'alone', 'opinion', 'depth', 'characters', 'easy', 'course', 'interpret', 'insanity', 'inevitable', 'saw', 'role', 'was', 'created', 'marriage', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'way', 'Rochester', 'allowed', 'happen', 'even', 'participated', 'so', 'bears', 'responsibility', 'then', 'once', 'better', 'life-style', 'opportunity', 'arises', 'Also', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'own', 'was', 'only', 'saw', 'realized', 'was', 'characters', 'Bronte', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'particularly', 'Lombard.Warmly', 'recommended']",N/A

I believe she was the only one who had the right to write about these characters, not someone else. Either this story should never have been written unless it was written by Charlotte Bronte herslef and not a different because author or this sotry should not have anything to do with the characters in Jane Eyre. I am appalled. I will pretend I never watched this movie and am glad I never read the book. And I will pretend this is a different Edward Rochester than the one in Jane Eyre. Bertha Antoinette was supposed to be crazy not a jealous psycho wife. According to jane Eyre's story she went crazy because it ran in the female side of the family (mother and grandmother). This movie made it look like the husdand,Rochester, drove her to insanity and locked her away his home in England. WRONG! He took her there because she was supposedly already crazy,instead of putting her in an insane asylum. They made him look like the bad guy in this story.
