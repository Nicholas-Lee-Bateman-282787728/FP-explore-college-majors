1661431,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B00DUJH94S,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[6, 7]","When Jack&#8217;s brother dies in a freak accident, Jack steps up &#8211; big time &#8211; to devote much of his life to help his sister-in-law raise their daughter there in New York City.  About eight years later, trouble surfaces, when Jack &#8211; a citizen of the UK here on a student visa &#8211; is turned down for a green card, and faces deportation.  While Jack is gay, he enlists the help of a lesbian co-worker to marry him, but she later panics when I.C.E. challenges their living situation.  In the interim, Jack has met Mano, and is in love.  Although Mano is a US citizen, and willing to marry Jack, this story took place when only the state would recognize a same-sex marriage, and, thus, it would not do him any good for federal immigration issues.It&#8217;s ironic and unfortunate that this 2012 film was released on DVD more than two months after the court decision on DOMA essentially made much of the plot obsolete.  It still delivers a powerful message about love and relationships, delivered by a diverse, talented cast with good direction. David W. Ross, who plays Jack, also wrote the screenplay, and the film has won awards at several film festivals.  Unrated, likely would not be anything other than a PG-13.  DVD includes extensive extras, including a music video, deleted scenes, cast Q&A;, and film festival coverage.

He has a straight brother and a few other connections, then after his brother has broken the news that he is to be a father he is run down and killed. The story moves on a number of years and Jack (David W. Ross who was in nineties boy band `The Backstreet Boys') has become the dutiful uncle to little Tara and a support to his sister in law, who clearly still misses her husband.Then Jack is told that immigration control is onto him (and they are not nice people) and he will be deported as his work visa is going to run out. His only hope it seems is to get married for the elusive `Green Card' and to do that means finding a pliable woman and actually knowing each other well enough to convince the authorities that they are not faking it. He does not want to leave his family, having no more connections in England and then he meets interior architect Mano who is Spanish and has a bit of emotional baggage but is a nice man and they soon fall for each other. The problems that they then face will test the mettle of everyone involved and simmering resentments, unsaid feelings and emotional extremes all come pouring out.This is a really powerful film. I thought it was a drama and a half as so much happens that it would be enough to turn most people to prescription medication or booze or both. The characters are all believable and the acting is superb, I particularly liked Sam who plays `the stately homo' as Mr Crisp once called himself.  His `besty' Alison is also great and plays the role of friend, confidant and betrayer all perfectly. The whole thing had me wanting to know more and I could not help being concerned for all of the characters which is a ruddy good achievement. I had no expectations of this at all but was left feeling I had seen something of rare quality, very moving and a rewarding watch too which I  can thoroughly recommend.",5,What would you do for a Green Card?,1385337600,"11 25, 2013",2013,1964,"['Jack', 'Englishman', 'New', 'York', 'subject', 'song', 'Quentin', 'Crisp', 'too', 'gay', 'straight', 'brother', 'few', 'other', 'connections', 'then', 'brother', 'broken', 'news', 'be', 'father', 'run', 'down', 'killed', 'story', 'moves', 'number', 'years', 'Jack', 'David', 'W.', 'Ross', 'who', 'was', 'nineties', 'boy', 'band', 'Backstreet', 'Boys', 'become', 'dutiful', 'uncle', 'little', 'Tara', 'support', 'sister', 'law', 'who', 'clearly', 'still', 'husband.Then', 'Jack', 'told', 'immigration', 'control', 'are', 'not', 'nice', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'deported', 'work', 'visa', 'going', 'run', 'out', 'only', 'hope', 'get', 'married', 'elusive', 'Green', 'Card', 'do', 'finding', 'pliable', 'woman', 'actually', 'knowing', 'other', 'well', 'enough', 'convince', 'authorities', 'are', 'not', 'faking', 'not', 'want', 'leave', 'family', 'having', 'more', 'connections', 'England', 'then', 'interior', 'architect', 'Mano', 'who', 'Spanish', 'bit', 'emotional', 'baggage', 'nice', 'man', 'soon', 'fall', 'other', 'problems', 'then', 'face', 'will', 'test', 'mettle', 'everyone', 'involved', 'simmering', 'resentments', 'unsaid', 'feelings', 'emotional', 'extremes', 'come', 'pouring', 'out.This', 'really', 'powerful', 'film', 'thought', 'was', 'drama', 'half', 'so', 'much', 'would', 'be', 'enough', 'turn', 'most', 'people', 'prescription', 'medication', 'booze', 'characters', 'are', 'believable', 'acting', 'superb', 'particularly', 'liked', 'Sam', 'who', 'stately', 'homo', 'Mr', 'Crisp', 'once', 'called', 'besty', 'Alison', 'also', 'great', 'role', 'friend', 'confidant', 'betrayer', 'perfectly', 'whole', 'thing', 'had', 'wanting', 'know', 'more', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'being', 'concerned', 'characters', 'ruddy', 'good', 'achievement', 'had', 'expectations', 'was', 'left', 'feeling', 'had', 'seen', 'something', 'rare', 'quality', 'very', 'moving', 'rewarding', 'watch', 'too', 'can', 'thoroughly', 'recommend']",N/A
