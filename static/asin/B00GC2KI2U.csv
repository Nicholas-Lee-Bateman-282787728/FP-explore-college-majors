She's a wonderful character and fun to watch but I'm not too crazy about the Flo series. Spinoffs are tricky and I feel that this one just didn't work. Still it's great that they release this series so we Flo fans can get a chance to see it.,3,What a mistake!,1384992000,"11 21, 2013",2013,298,"['biggest', 'mistake', 'did', 'was', 'let', 'Flo', 'leave', 'Alice', 'wonderful', 'character', 'fun', 'watch', ""'m"", 'not', 'too', 'crazy', 'Flo', 'series', 'Spinoffs', 'are', 'tricky', 'feel', 'one', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'Still', 'great', 'release', 'series', 'Flo', 'fans', 'can', 'get', 'chance', 'see']",Flo: The Complete Series

I really believe Flo should have stayed with Alice. Some things just don't work out when you make a character(s) into new series. Remember &#34;The Ropers&#34;? For the price its not bad but don't expect the greatness of Alice which she helped make.,3,For the price its not bad but don't expect the greatness of Alice which she ...,1405036800,"07 11, 2014",2014,363,"['Flo', 'was', 'OK', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'long', 'think', 'season', 'half', 'episodes', 'are', 'included', 'here', 'really', 'believe', 'Flo', 'should', 'have', 'stayed', 'Alice', 'things', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'when', 'make', 'character', 's', 'new', 'series', 'Remember', '34', 'Ropers', '34', 'price', 'not', 'bad', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'greatness', 'Alice', 'helped', 'make']",Flo: The Complete Series

Another surprise was to see Lucy Lee FLippen who had finished doing Little House on the Praire where she played Alonozo WIlders sister and school teacher and in Flo she played  Flo's Prim and proper sister Fran .

People just complain to much. They gave some FLO time on the final eposide of Alice. I wished when Vera got married they would have invited Flo and Belle to the wedding. Flo was my favorite too but the rest of the characters on Alice was just as funny. Vera and Mel cracked me up. I want to own the whole series.,5,Love FLO and Alice...
