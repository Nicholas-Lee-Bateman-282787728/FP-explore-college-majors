1266343,A142H6XK0OLTYL,B002FL3IR4,Glen R. Bleak,"[2, 4]","I was kind of disappointed with this program.  I was expecting more from it than what I got.  I was expecting this program would be about the Neatherhal species that was discovered in Europe about 30,000 to 38,000 years ago.  However, it was still an interesting program that I enjoyed.  My comments about this program are as follows:Lewis Bingford from SMU hypothesis doesn't make sense to me.  I don't what evidence he was studying, but, I have to agree with Pat Shipman of Penn State, how would anyone know which artifacts belong to a female or a male?  Also, what advantage of having separate life styles between females and males, especially in harsh conditions of those times.  It was stated that Neo (neatherhal) didn't evolve family structure yet.  In my opinion it would had to been unevolved, since most of today's primates live in family structure and the fossil record indicated's primate ancestry along the line of Homo Sapiens, all had family structure.  The only primate that I know that don't have family structure is the Orangutan In Boreo.  This is because of the abundance of food source in jungles and family ties between male and female is not required.  Of course females in Neo society were not permitted to hold high positions nor were they highly regarded in the family structure.  I believe that even today, Man are still trying to distant themselves from Neo and It's a sad situation when knowledgeable men of science let's there religious bias interfere with there scientific judgement.If Neo was a separate species from Homo Sapiens, how could they pass on there genes to us.  Unless, I don't have a good understanding of species which is a ""group of individuals that can share genes and produce fertile offspring.""  Some closely related species can produce sterile offspring which are dead ends ie Mule.  If we do share genes with Neo it would have to been through Neo's and Homo Sapiens common ancestor which is my favorite ""Homo Erectus.""  If we are separate species, searching for Neo in our genes would be waste of time.",4,My Comments on The Last Neandertal,1355011200,"12 9, 2012",2012,2054,"['was', 'kind', 'disappointed', 'program', 'was', 'expecting', 'more', 'what', 'got', 'was', 'expecting', 'program', 'would', 'be', 'Neatherhal', 'species', 'was', 'discovered', 'Europe', '30,000', '38,000', 'years', 'ago', 'However', 'was', 'still', 'interesting', 'program', 'enjoyed', 'comments', 'program', 'are', 'Lewis', 'Bingford', 'SMU', 'hypothesis', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'do', ""n't"", 'what', 'evidence', 'was', 'studying', 'have', 'agree', 'Pat', 'Shipman', 'Penn', 'State', 'how', 'would', 'anyone', 'know', 'belong', 'female', 'male', 'Also', 'what', 'advantage', 'having', 'separate', 'life', 'styles', 'females', 'males', 'especially', 'harsh', 'conditions', 'times', 'was', 'stated', 'Neo', 'neatherhal', 'did', ""n't"", 'evolve', 'family', 'structure', 'yet', 'opinion', 'would', 'had', 'been', 'unevolved', 'most', 'today', 'primates', 'live', 'family', 'structure', 'fossil', 'record', 'indicated', 'primate', 'ancestry', 'line', 'Homo', 'Sapiens', 'had', 'family', 'structure', 'only', 'primate', 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'family', 'structure', 'Orangutan', 'Boreo', 'abundance', 'food', 'source', 'jungles', 'family', 'ties', 'male', 'female', 'not', 'required', 'course', 'females', 'Neo', 'society', 'were', 'not', 'permitted', 'hold', 'high', 'positions', 'were', 'highly', 'regarded', 'family', 'structure', 'believe', 'even', 'today', 'Man', 'are', 'still', 'trying', 'distant', 'Neo', 'sad', 'situation', 'when', 'knowledgeable', 'men', 'science', 'let', 'religious', 'bias', 'interfere', 'scientific', 'judgement.If', 'Neo', 'was', 'separate', 'species', 'Homo', 'Sapiens', 'how', 'could', 'pass', 'genes', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'good', 'understanding', 'species', 'group', 'individuals', 'can', 'share', 'genes', 'produce', 'fertile', 'offspring', 'closely', 'related', 'species', 'can', 'produce', 'sterile', 'offspring', 'are', 'dead', 'ends', 'ie', 'Mule', 'do', 'share', 'genes', 'Neo', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'Neo', 'Homo', 'Sapiens', 'common', 'ancestor', 'favorite', 'Homo', 'Erectus', 'are', 'separate', 'species', 'searching', 'Neo', 'genes', 'would', 'be', 'waste', 'time']",N/A

1266345,A20QYY9BECJKMA,B002FL3IR4,Jennifer,"[3, 4]","Very informative program exploring the origins of modern man. Who were the neandertals and why did they mysteriously disappear? What about Cro-Magnon man? Where did he come from? This program will try to answer all of these probing questions.The Neandertals are an extinct species or subspecies of the genus Homo which is closely related to modern humans. They are known from fossils, dating from the Pleistocene period, which have been found in Europe and parts of western and central Asia. The species is named after Neandertal (""Neander's Valley""), the location in Germany where it was first discovered.Neandertals are classified either as a subspecies of Homo sapiens, or as a separate species of the same genus. The first humans with proto-Neandertal traits are believed to have existed in Europe as early as 600,000-350,000 years ago.When the Neandertals went extinct is disputed. Fossils found in the Vindija Cave in Croatia have been dated to between 33,000 and 32,000 years old, and Neandertal artifacts from Gorham's Cave in Gibraltar are believed to be less than 30,000 years ago, but a recent study has re-dated fossils at two Spanish sites as 45,000 years old, 10,000 years older than previously thought, and may cast doubt on recent dates at other sites. Cro-Magnon (early-modern-human) skeletal remains showing certain ""Neandertal traits"" have been found in Lagar Velho (Portugal) and dated to 24,500 years ago, suggesting that there may have been an extensive admixture of the Cro-Magnon and Neandertal populations in that region.Neandertal cranial capacity is thought to have been as large as that of modern humans, perhaps larger, indicating that their brain size may have been comparable, or larger, as well. In 2008, a group of scientists created a study using three-dimensional computer-assisted reconstructions of Neandertal infants based on fossils found in Russia and Syria. The study showed Neandertal and modern human brains were the same size at birth, but by adulthood, the Neandertal brain was larger than the modern human brain. They were much stronger than modern humans, having particularly strong arms and hands. Males stood 164-168 cm (65-66 in) and females about 152-156 cm (60-61 in)tall.Genetic evidence published in 2010 suggests that Neandertals contributed to the DNA of anatomically modern humans, probably through interbreeding between 80,000 and 50,000 years ago with the population of anatomically modern humans who had recently migrated from Africa. According to the study, by the time that population began dispersing across Eurasia, Neandertals genes constituted as much as 1-4% of its genome (roughly equivalent to having one Neandertal great-great-great-grandparent). &Ouml;tzi the iceman, Europe's oldest preserved mummy, was found to possess an even higher percentage of Neandertal ancestry.Current scientific literature prefers the term European Early Modern Humans (EEMH), to the term 'Cro-Magnon' which has no formal taxonomic status, as it refers neither to a species or subspecies nor to an archaeological phase or culture. The earliest known remains of Cro-Magnon-like humans are radiocarbon dated to 43,000 years before present time.Cro-Magnons were robustly built and powerful. The body was generally heavy and solid with a strong musculature. The forehead was fairly straight rather than sloping like in Neandertals, and with only slight browridges. The face was short and wide. Like other modern humans, Cro-Magnons had a prominent chin. The brain capacity was about 1,600 cubic centimeters(98 cu in), larger than the average for modern humans. However recent research suggests that the physical dimensions of so-called ""Cro-Magnon"" are not sufficiently different from modern humans to warrant a separate designation.Wherever modern man evolved and from which possible species is still a bit questionable, but scientists are beginning to come closer to that answer using Mitochondrial DNA research as well as Nuclear DNA research.I suppose, in the end, it doesn't really matter where we modern humans descended from because the fact remains that we are now here and present. This program is a great and informative watch. It makes you think about our possible origins, and that in itself, is a good thing.
