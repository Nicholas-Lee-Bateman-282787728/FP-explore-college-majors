Although there are some serious themes (Martin struggling to find himself as he prepares for he and Gina's marriage, Tommy and Pam finally getting together), the laughs are endless in this third ""Martin"" DVD released...in 2007. Some of the memorable moments include Martin's misadventures in the work force, including a stint as a  floor-buffer, Martin and Gina going undercover to find out what Tommy does for a living, Martin's confrontation with a child claiming to be his son, Martin's refusal to pay his rent, which leaves he and the gang in chills during a huge snowstorm, a 70's themed ""Player's Ball"" the gang holds to save an old movie theatre, and of course the wedding episode.

By the end of the year, three (count 'em, 3) seasons of Martin will have been released on DVD for my and other fans' viewing pleasure. By the third season, ""Martin"" was under going slight changes. Peripheral characters were no longer being seen (Stan and Sean) while others were being added and / or given slightly increased screen time (think Bruh Man, who is essentially the ""Martin"" equivalent of ""Seinfeld's"" Kramer, at the end of the second season). Unlike other sitcoms, I think ""Martin"" hit its stride in the 2nd half of the first season and went strong until the series finale.While I'm NOT actually reviewing the DVD set (I haven't received an advanced copy or anything), I will say that the first 2 seasons released were a mixed blessing. On one hand, we got the full episodes as opposed to those shown in syndication and remastered picture quality (which, while expected, is none the less worthy of applause). On the other hand, the first season included just 2 special features. The first being blooper highlights which were funny but nothing special, while the other was another set of highlights overdubbed with the reflections of Martin Lawrence himself. Martin sounded very disinterested and none of the other cast members were included in this ""walk down memory lane"". The second season didn't include any special features.However, I'll gladly just take the complete episodes.For those who ""hate when there are reviews of products not yet released"", rest assured that I will delete this post once the 3rd season has been released.

More and more special guests come in during this season too (Pam Grier, Outkast, Babyface, Paul Anthony from Full Force, BeBe and CeCe Winans, Hammer, Coolio, Gary Coleman, Antonio Fargas - Huggy Bear, Kelly Coffield - white gurl from In Living Color, Vivica A. Fox, and more).  You see less of Mama Payne this season, but you get more of Street Hustler, Jerome and everyones favorite Shenehneh and her friends (Laquita and Key Lo Lo)!  Correction to one of the reviewers (sorry Sixx), but Notorious B.I.G. will not appear until the third episode of the fourth season (I dunno when that DVD will be out, but hopefully fast).Back to the episodes, these are my top 10 favorites in no particular order (It was soo hard to choose because this season was too funny):-1 The Wedding Planner (""Men On Film, skip y'all a**es on outta here!)-2 The Lottery (""split 300 of these!"")-3 Snow Storm (""Hustle Man!  Take your seagul sellin' a** on outta here!"")-4 Meatloaf and Waffle Resturant-5 Players Ball-6 Thanksgiving (""Raggedy a** peas!"" - LOL)-7 Mad Dog No Good-8 Gina's Friend (""There's a horse in Detroit freezin' his a** off!"")-9 The Love Doctor-10 The Women's ClubI'm glad I pre-ordered my copy and can't wait for it to come out next week!!  I'm positive that like season's 1 and 2 dvd's I bought earlier this year, season 3 will not let me down!  I urge all Martin fans and non-Martin fans to get them!!",5,Can't Wait Another Day!!!,1193702400,"10 30, 2007",2007,2318,"['are', 'takin', 'too', 'long', 'release', 'was', 'be', 'funneist', 'season', 'Martin', 'know', 'what', 'everybodys', 'thinkin', 'opinion', 'know', 'Stan', 'Shawn', 'were', 'longer', 'part', 'cast', 'Martin', 'no', 'longer', 'radio', 'station', 'talk', 'show', 'host', 'was', 'waaaayyyy', 'better', 'first', 'season', 'where', 'everyone', 'tellin', 'Tommy', 'Ai', ""n't"", 'Got', 'No', 'Job', 'running', 'joke', 'then', 'last', 'season', ""'m"", 'aware', 'few', 'episodes', 'season', 'two', 'Tommy', 'friends', 'just', 'questioned', 'profession', ""was'nt"", 'as', 'funny', 'future', 'episodes', 'season', 'when', 'Tommy', 'Pam', 'hook', 'up', 'thanks', 'Martin', 'Love', 'Doctor', 'first', 'season', 'where', 'Martin', 'gang', 'hang', 'out', 'Nipsey', 'Resturant', 'first', 'time', 'Nipsey', 'course', 'Hustle', 'Man', 'debut', 'season', 'Wuts', 'Happenin', 'Cheif', 'Bro', 'Man', 'more', 'often', 'season', 'More', 'more', 'special', 'guests', 'come', 'season', 'too', 'Pam', 'Grier', 'Outkast', 'Babyface', 'Paul', 'Anthony', 'Full', 'Force', 'BeBe', 'CeCe', 'Winans', 'Hammer', 'Coolio', 'Gary', 'Coleman', 'Antonio', 'Fargas', 'Huggy', 'Bear', 'Kelly', 'Coffield', 'white', 'gurl', 'Living', 'Color', 'Vivica', 'A', 'Fox', 'more', 'see', 'less', 'Mama', 'Payne', 'season', 'get', 'more', 'Street', 'Hustler', 'Jerome', 'everyones', 'favorite', 'Shenehneh', 'friends', 'Laquita', 'Key', 'Lo', 'Lo', 'Correction', 'one', 'reviewers', 'sorry', 'Sixx', 'Notorious', 'B.I.G', 'will', 'not', 'appear', 'third', 'episode', 'fourth', 'season', 'dunno', 'when', 'DVD', 'will', 'be', 'out', 'hopefully', 'fast', '.Back', 'episodes', 'are', 'top', '10', 'favorites', 'particular', 'order', 'was', 'soo', 'hard', 'choose', 'season', 'was', 'too', 'funny', '-1', 'Wedding', 'Planner', 'Men', 'Film', 'skip', ""y'all"", 'a**es', 'outta', 'here', '-2', 'Lottery', 'split', '300', '-3', 'Snow', 'Storm', 'Hustle', 'Man', 'Take', 'seagul', 'sellin', 'a**', 'outta', 'here', '-4', 'Meatloaf', 'Waffle', 'Resturant-5', 'Players', 'Ball-6', 'Thanksgiving', 'Raggedy', 'a**', 'peas', 'LOL', '-7', 'Mad', 'Dog', 'No', 'Good-8', 'Gina', 'Friend', 'horse', 'Detroit', 'freezin', 'a**', 'Love', 'Doctor-10', 'Women', 'ClubI', ""'m"", 'glad', 'pre-ordered', 'copy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'come', 'out', 'next', 'week', ""'m"", 'positive', 'season', '1', '2', 'dvd', 'bought', 'earlier', 'year', 'season', '3', 'will', 'not', 'let', 'down', 'urge', 'Martin', 'fans', 'non-Martin', 'fans', 'get']",N/A
