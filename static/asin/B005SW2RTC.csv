1502981,AAZRWLML88IZK,B005SW2RTC,A kids review,"[5, 6]","It's romantic to imagine that people with exceptional talents also have exceptional stories to tell about those talents. In the case of English food journalist Nigel Slater, it's somewhat true. Based on Slater's autobiographical novel of the same name, Toast recounts the writer's childhood growing up with an asthmatic mother who was such a poor cook that the only dish she ever mastered was, well, toast. When her illness finally gets the best of her, young Nigel and his father welcome a new addition to the family in the form of a housekeeper named Mrs. Potter, who soon wins over Nigel's father and engages Nigel himself in a sort of ongoing culinary rivalry. Toast was just a tad too saccharine for me, but I'll give it 2 stars, because I liked its breezy humor, visual touches, and judicious use of Helena Bonham Carter's talents. It's an unusual coming of age story, but its charms may just work for some.",2,Toast,1325116800,"12 29, 2011",2011,913,"['romantic', 'imagine', 'people', 'exceptional', 'talents', 'also', 'have', 'exceptional', 'stories', 'tell', 'talents', 'case', 'English', 'food', 'journalist', 'Nigel', 'Slater', 'somewhat', 'true', 'Based', 'Slater', 'autobiographical', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Toast', 'writer', 'childhood', 'growing', 'up', 'asthmatic', 'mother', 'who', 'was', 'such', 'poor', 'cook', 'only', 'dish', 'ever', 'mastered', 'was', 'well', 'toast', 'When', 'illness', 'finally', 'best', 'young', 'Nigel', 'father', 'welcome', 'new', 'addition', 'family', 'form', 'housekeeper', 'named', 'Mrs.', 'Potter', 'who', 'soon', 'over', 'Nigel', 'father', 'Nigel', 'sort', 'ongoing', 'culinary', 'rivalry', 'Toast', 'was', 'just', 'tad', 'too', 'saccharine', ""'ll"", 'give', '2', 'stars', 'liked', 'breezy', 'humor', 'visual', 'touches', 'judicious', 'use', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'talents', 'unusual', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'charms', 'may', 'just', 'work']",N/A

Hobbs ""Bill Hobbs""","[0, 1]","Nigel Slater, famed British food critic and about-town culinary ace,has provided a solid, respectful subject for this bio-pic.  A disclaimer tells us that the film is based upon true events.This BBC production,starring Helena Bonham Carter, is a film certainly worth viewing--a story, we're told, of a young man's journey into successful adulthood. Alas, it was not easy, as young Nigel loses him mother early on and is soon replaced by Mrs. Potter (""She's our cleaner,"" young Nigel tells guests at a social gathering.)  From the day Mrs. Potter (Carter) is hired, the rivalry between Nigel and her over the affections of his father become more acute as each month goes by--they compete with each other by trying to outdo each other's cooking.  There is no love lost between them.  Eventually, Nigel's father dies (clearly from overeating!) and Nigel then frees himself to pursue a dream--his love of cooking. And he's finally free of Mrs. Potter.Along the way, as the film shows, we find highs and lows for him, some funny instances and many not-so-funny.  One has to empathize with him, for certainly he feels he has ""the ugly stepmother"" with whom to contend, although, of course, Carter is anything but ugly. Throughout the film, viewers root for some type of rapprochement between the two--but it never happens, sad to say.  Still, the film captures some terrifically poignant moments--with excellent dialogue, good editing, and quality acting.  I was unfamiliar with the movie until I accidentally ran across a trailer. I wasn't disappointed in the film.  Carter was outstanding, especially, and quite convincing as the step-mother.  It was actually refreshing, too, to hear so many good Dusty Springfield songs in the soundtrack.

Clay ""drakkar91""","[0, 1]","If ever there was a movie that told the story of ""how to turn lemons into lemonade"", `Toast' may well fit the bill.`Toast' is the joyful, and at times painful story of Nigel who dreams - of cooking, of a perfect family and much more.  Truly a triumphant story telling of a true story, the films brings to life the story of a young man, coming of age ever so quickly after losing his beloved mother at a young age.  The insanity follows as his father mostly incapable of emotion falls for a married cleaning lady (Mrs. Potter) who knows how to cook, and smoke.  A series of life events leads our young Nigel into rapid adulthood.Throughout the film, the music of Dusty Springfield (featuring tracks from her albumWhere Am I Going) embraces the viewer and carries us away with Nigel.  As the film nears its end, Nigel steals a chance at love, and the scene is certain to bring back every 40+ something man memories of his first time (I'm intentionally being vague).`Toast' is a heartwarming tale that can inspire us to remember we truly can do anything we want in life if we dream a little and take a big chance.  Obviously I enjoyed the film, but I could understand if some found it a tad slow in the middle.  This isn't the Hollywood love story telling ofTitanic, it's a true love story based on real life.

1502985,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B005SW2RTC,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 2]","TOAST (2010, 96 minutes, there are 12 other films with this title) is based on the memoir of some famous food chef/critic called Nigel Slater, who is a complete stranger to me. This begins with Nigel's (a delightfully prim Oscar Kennedy) childhood, set in the 1960s around the time he lost his mother, when he also discovered the joy of food/cooking and began to deal with his sexuality.Fast forward a few years, after old Mr. Slater (an interesting turn by Ken Stott) has remarried, to the bouncy Joan Potter (Helena Bonham Carter), an unfortunate yet well-meaning social climber who of course becomes Nigel's archnemesis. At this period Nigel is played by Freddie Highmore, who reminded me of a stuck-up Norman Bates * - and that is not good in a role like this. Highmore, in spite of his natural sweetness and willowy good looks, simply pushed the nasty envelope with his character's snotty, classist coldness.With the film punctuated by a beautifully handled crush young Nigel has on their gardener Josh (the ever-beautiful Matthew McNulty) and a wonderful kiss the older Nigel shares with a passing acquaintance (after which Nigel says sadly, ""Don't leave me here alone"") - well, it has its moments but I felt ultimately it came to nothing. Apparently this is what one gets when watching a film version of a published memoir, and I was drawn in yet repulsed by the subject.The cinematography is quite good, with a ""flat depth"" something like a drab painting (and this changes toward the end when everything flares with color). The acting of course is quite fun and I found moments in this film to be fall-down funny (as when Mr Slater is introduced to spaghetti the first time). The final shot, with Nigel shoving his way into what looked like either a restaurant or chef school - it went by when I wasn't really looking - I did not like the evil feeling the scene conveyed.Overall, I cannot say this is a family film (some Midlands humor and the accent make up lots of fun but may also be offensive). It struck me as a series of strung-together one-liners, and that is never good filmmaking no matter what anyone tells you. A director like Woody Allen could have made much of this; so much for what could have been!I give four stars for the overall calm of the film, the cuteness of the actors and Freddie Highmore's official introduction to the world of adult roles. Also watch for the chef at the end, which is a cameo by the real Nigel. The fourth star is for bringing with great courage the subject of a gay boy's formative years, and doing it without a bunch of mindless sex (even if they chose to make the subject even more tasteless with a rather brutish, insensitive Highmore).* UPDATE: Wow, I must be a clairvoyant after all. I have returned to this review because I see Highmore IS playing a young Norman Bates on TV in America. That explains this entire role, plus the blatant reference to it which I leave for you to discover in the film. Let me just clue you in: it is reminiscent of the closing shot of PSYCHO. This is truly strange because I don't think I have ever seen a thing like this before: an actor making a blatant reference to a future role he's going to play, before anyone knows of it.",4,"""He's putty in mum's hands once he's had his toad-in-the-hole.""",1350345600,"10 16, 2012",2012,3217,"['TOAST', '2010', '96', 'minutes', 'are', '12', 'other', 'films', 'title', 'based', 'memoir', 'famous', 'food', 'chef/critic', 'called', 'Nigel', 'Slater', 'who', 'complete', 'stranger', 'Nigel', 'delightfully', 'prim', 'Oscar', 'Kennedy', 'childhood', 'set', '1960s', 'time', 'lost', 'mother', 'when', 'also', 'discovered', 'joy', 'food/cooking', 'began', 'deal', 'sexuality.Fast', 'forward', 'few', 'years', 'old', 'Mr.', 'Slater', 'interesting', 'turn', 'Ken', 'Stott', 'remarried', 'bouncy', 'Joan', 'Potter', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'unfortunate', 'yet', 'well-meaning', 'social', 'climber', 'who', 'course', 'Nigel', 'archnemesis', 'period', 'Nigel', 'played', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'who', 'reminded', 'stuck-up', 'Norman', 'Bates', '*', 'not', 'good', 'role', 'Highmore', 'spite', 'natural', 'sweetness', 'willowy', 'good', 'looks', 'simply', 'pushed', 'nasty', 'envelope', 'character', 'snotty', 'classist', 'coldness.With', 'film', 'punctuated', 'beautifully', 'handled', 'crush', 'young', 'Nigel', 'gardener', 'Josh', 'ever-beautiful', 'Matthew', 'McNulty', 'wonderful', 'kiss', 'older', 'Nigel', 'shares', 'passing', 'acquaintance', 'Nigel', 'sadly', 'Do', ""n't"", 'leave', 'here', 'alone', 'well', 'moments', 'felt', 'ultimately', 'came', 'nothing', 'Apparently', 'what', 'one', 'when', 'watching', 'film', 'version', 'published', 'memoir', 'was', 'drawn', 'yet', 'repulsed', 'subject.The', 'cinematography', 'quite', 'good', 'flat', 'depth', 'something', 'drab', 'painting', 'end', 'when', 'everything', 'color', 'acting', 'course', 'quite', 'fun', 'found', 'moments', 'film', 'be', 'fall-down', 'funny', 'when', 'Mr', 'Slater', 'introduced', 'spaghetti', 'first', 'time', 'final', 'shot', 'Nigel', 'shoving', 'way', 'what', 'looked', 'restaurant', 'chef', 'school', 'went', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'looking', 'did', 'not', 'evil', 'feeling', 'scene', 'conveyed.Overall', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'family', 'film', 'Midlands', 'humor', 'accent', 'make', 'up', 'lots', 'fun', 'may', 'also', 'be', 'offensive', 'struck', 'series', 'strung-together', 'one-liners', 'never', 'good', 'filmmaking', 'matter', 'what', 'anyone', 'director', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'much', 'so', 'much', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'overall', 'calm', 'film', 'cuteness', 'actors', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'official', 'introduction', 'world', 'adult', 'roles', 'Also', 'watch', 'chef', 'end', 'cameo', 'real', 'Nigel', 'fourth', 'star', 'bringing', 'great', 'courage', 'subject', 'gay', 'boy', 'formative', 'years', 'doing', 'bunch', 'mindless', 'sex', 'even', 'chose', 'make', 'subject', 'even', 'more', 'tasteless', 'rather', 'brutish', 'insensitive', 'Highmore', '*', 'UPDATE', 'Wow', 'must', 'be', 'clairvoyant', 'have', 'returned', 'review', 'see', 'Highmore', 'IS', 'playing', 'young', 'Norman', 'Bates', 'TV', 'America', 'entire', 'role', 'blatant', 'reference', 'leave', 'discover', 'film', 'Let', 'just', 'clue', 'reminiscent', 'closing', 'shot', 'PSYCHO', 'truly', 'strange', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'thing', 'before', 'actor', 'making', 'blatant', 'reference', 'future', 'role', 'going', 'play', 'anyone', 'knows']",N/A

1502987,AG8K92N37MT27,B005SW2RTC,Garnet,"[0, 0]","This is a movie about emotion that finds expression through food, in both good and bad ways.  The title itself should be a giveaway!  Set in the 1960's, the costumes and vintage background in this movie are wonderful to look at, plus the actors do a good job--especially one of my favorites, Helena Bonham Carter as the up-and-coming Mrs Potter.  It can be a bit slow at times, but I really did enjoy it.Some Spoilers:Nigel is a young man who grows up in a middle-class household where his father works and his mother stays home and can't cook.  Yes, that's right...she can barely make toast.  In fact, this is what they tend to eat most of the time.  Nigel, on the other hand, is fixated on food, on food they've never had and never tasted, and that he longs for.  More than anything, this longing for food is a longing for more affection from his distant father and his neurotic mother who means well, but is just too delicate.When his mother dies, his father hires a cleaning lady/cook, Mrs Potter, who insinuates her way into their life by means of her wonderful dishes.  After all, the way to a man is through his stomach, right?  Nigel can't stand to have this woman replace his mother, so he starts competing with Mrs Potter in the cooking dept and his father ends up caught in the middle.Some funny bits in the movie include Nigel joining the girls in Home Economics and out-cooking the lot of them.  Also, the battle of the lemon meringue pies.  But, overall, this movie has a bittersweet, even sad quality to it...especially by the end when it becomes obvious that food doesn't just mean emotional security to Nigel and his father, but to Mrs Potter, as well.Not really a kid's movie.  I'm not sure this is a keeper, but I think its worth watching once if you enjoy food and cooking and movies set in the 1960's...which I do.

The film is the true story of British food critic Nigel Slater's life from childhood to his teens when he struck out on his own in the ""food business"".""Middle class"", Nigel (brilliantly acted by Oscar Kennedy--Nigel as child and Freddie Highmore--Nigel as teen) is shown as a rather precocious almost irritating brat that deeply loves his sickly mom and loves food  and is not too excepting of his father's ackward attempts at love (greatly acted by Ken Stott).  Nigel  has very poor exposure to good food and its preparation thereof until the ""wild"" and very competitive housekeeper (and eventually stepmom) comes along--wonderfully played by (as a ""brassy"" blond) Helena Bonham Carter.This film certainly captures the early 1960s (clothes, soundtrack, etc) so very well.
