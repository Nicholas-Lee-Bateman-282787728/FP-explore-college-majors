672988,A15G57AIKJ5PRQ,B00005OSLQ,"A. C. Walter ""awalter""","[30, 35]","A rubber company that specializes in manufacturing condoms is downsizing, and Francois Pignon (Daniel Auteuil) is about to be laid off. Pignon is an extremely ordinary and dull person, and no one can think of a good reason to keep him on. Also, he is still in love with his ex-wife and tries to be a father to his estranged son, but neither of them return his affection. Getting his pink slip sends Pignon into a short-lived depression, when his new neighbor hatches a scheme to help Pignon keep his job. Belone, the neighbor, doctors some photos of men in a gay bar--putting Pignon's face on one of the men--and sends them in an anonymous envelope to his employer. He tells Pignon to not even worry about acting gay; just stay the same, he says, and everyone around you will alter *their* behavior. The main objective is, of course, to scare a condom company out of firing a gay man, and as expected, all manner of hilarity ensues.Director and screenwriter Francis Veber's &quot;The Closet&quot; rides the wave of international success stirred by his 1998 film &quot;The Dinner Game&quot; without providing as well-structured or as consistent a story. The first half of the film is every bit as funny as the setup to &quot;The Dinner Game,&quot; supplying nearly a dozen fascinating characters (all wonderfully acted by a superb ensemble cast), and promising much. Part of concept of the film deals with shifting the focus from Pignon to the people around him. Unfortunately, in an 80-minute film, Veber is unable to complete even a minimal story arc for each character--which leaves the film feeling somewhat disjointed in the end.Perhaps it is to Veber's detriment, in a film like this, that he writes such consistently fascinating characters; if the characters were less intriguing, the audience would not protest when one of them disappeared or suddenly and inexplicably turned into a simple caricature. For example, Gerard Depardieu plays Santini, an office homophobe who must begin to &quot;play nice&quot; with Pignon or risk losing his own job. For a while, this relationship promises the sort of intense character interaction at which Veber excels. Soon, however, Santini undergoes a comic but inexplicable personality change and is marginalized from the film. Santini's role in the story is replaced by a smattering of vignettes which show other office workers being alternately cruel and kind toward Pignon.Additionally, like Veber's previous film, &quot;The Closet&quot; obtains its comic premise from a social injustice. This film, however, is slightly more blatant in its message-oriented nature. In message films, an audience often has to endure forced dialogue--sometimes even entire forced scenes--which are not organic to the piece. While &quot;The Closet&quot; is not as preachy as it might have been in the hands of another director, the occasional sermonizing does detract from the film.",3,Comes on strong but finishes weak.,995328000,"07 17, 2001",2001,2909,"['rubber', 'company', 'manufacturing', 'condoms', 'downsizing', 'Francois', 'Pignon', 'Daniel', 'Auteuil', 'be', 'laid', 'off', 'Pignon', 'extremely', 'ordinary', 'dull', 'person', 'one', 'can', 'think', 'good', 'reason', 'keep', 'Also', 'still', 'love', 'ex-wife', 'tries', 'be', 'father', 'estranged', 'son', 'return', 'affection', 'Getting', 'pink', 'slip', 'Pignon', 'short-lived', 'depression', 'when', 'new', 'neighbor', 'scheme', 'help', 'Pignon', 'keep', 'job', 'Belone', 'neighbor', 'doctors', 'photos', 'men', 'gay', 'bar', 'putting', 'Pignon', 'face', 'one', 'men', 'anonymous', 'envelope', 'employer', 'Pignon', 'not', 'even', 'worry', 'acting', 'gay', 'just', 'stay', 'same', 'everyone', 'will', 'alter', '*their*', 'behavior', 'main', 'objective', 'course', 'scare', 'condom', 'company', 'firing', 'gay', 'man', 'expected', 'manner', 'hilarity', 'ensues.Director', 'screenwriter', 'Francis', 'Veber', 'quot', 'Closet', 'quot', 'wave', 'international', 'success', 'stirred', '1998', 'film', 'quot', 'Dinner', 'Game', 'quot', 'providing', 'well-structured', 'consistent', 'story', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'bit', 'as', 'funny', 'setup', 'quot', 'Dinner', 'Game', 'quot', 'supplying', 'nearly', 'dozen', 'fascinating', 'characters', 'wonderfully', 'acted', 'superb', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'promising', 'much', 'Part', 'concept', 'film', 'deals', 'shifting', 'focus', 'Pignon', 'people', 'Unfortunately', '80-minute', 'film', 'Veber', 'unable', 'complete', 'even', 'minimal', 'story', 'arc', 'character', 'film', 'feeling', 'somewhat', 'disjointed', 'end.Perhaps', 'Veber', 'detriment', 'film', 'such', 'consistently', 'fascinating', 'characters', 'characters', 'were', 'less', 'intriguing', 'audience', 'would', 'not', 'protest', 'when', 'one', 'disappeared', 'suddenly', 'inexplicably', 'turned', 'simple', 'caricature', 'example', 'Gerard', 'Depardieu', 'Santini', 'office', 'homophobe', 'who', 'must', 'begin', 'quot', 'play', 'nice', 'quot', 'Pignon', 'risk', 'losing', 'own', 'job', 'while', 'relationship', 'sort', 'intense', 'character', 'interaction', 'Veber', 'excels', 'Soon', 'however', 'Santini', 'comic', 'inexplicable', 'personality', 'change', 'marginalized', 'film', 'Santini', 'role', 'story', 'replaced', 'smattering', 'vignettes', 'show', 'other', 'office', 'workers', 'being', 'alternately', 'cruel', 'kind', 'Pignon.Additionally', 'Veber', 'previous', 'film', 'quot', 'Closet', 'quot', 'comic', 'premise', 'social', 'injustice', 'film', 'however', 'slightly', 'more', 'blatant', 'message-oriented', 'nature', 'message', 'films', 'audience', 'often', 'endure', 'forced', 'dialogue', 'sometimes', 'even', 'entire', 'forced', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'organic', 'piece', 'quot', 'Closet', 'quot', 'not', 'as', 'preachy', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'hands', 'director', 'occasional', 'sermonizing', 'detract', 'film']",The Closet

He finds, while in the bathroom from the chief of personnel (Gerarad Depardieu)that he will be laid off. Depardieu is also the coach of the company rugby team, a homophobic macho maniac.Everybody seems to know that he's getting canned but him.While trying to kill himself by jumping off a window, his new neighbor stops him. ""It's my car down there, you'll wreck the roof"" His neighbor, an industrial psychologist hatches a plan to save Pignon's job. He alters some gay pictures to make it seem that Pignon is gay. He cannot be fired anymore, or the company, with a large gay clientele would suffer a public relations nightmare.He does not change anything in his life. His words, his actions, are exactly the same, but the reactions of everybody in his life to him change dramatically. His ex-wife, (Alexandra Vandernoot from The Dinner Game) who won't even take his calls, now answers the phone. Even his son, who refuses to dine with him because he is so drab, finds him interesting and cool after seeing him in the gay pride parade.The whole movie is a study in reality vs perception, with a comic French touch that will have you laughing out loud.Next the cast.I've already mentioned Auteil and Depardieu, but the rest of the cast is a who's who of modern French cinema.Thierry Lhermitte, and Alexandra Vandernoot from The Dinner Game; Jean Rochefort from The hairdresser's husband and The Professional.If you like mainstream movies, or slapstick, then you probably are not reading this.

672990,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B00005OSLQ,Andy Orrock,"[3, 4]","I enjoyed Francis Veber's 'The Closet' - released in France in 2001 - for two reasons.  First, it features an all-star ensemble of French acting, certainly a tribute to Veber's skill as a director.  Just take a gander at the first six names to appear on the IMDB credits:Daniel Auteuil ....  Franois PignonG&eacute;rard Depardieu ....  F&eacute;lix SantiniThierry Lhermitte ....  GuillaumeMich&egrave;le Laroque ....  Mlle BertrandMichel Aumont ....  Belone, the neighbourJean Rochefort ....  Kopel, the directorImagine a movie where the great Jean Rochefort gets slotted sixth.  Each of these six stars can carry a movie in France on their own back.  The fact that the group has teamed here is a testament to Veber's reputation.  His previous release, 1998's 'The Dinner Game,' was lauded far and wide as a comedic masterpiece.  Actors get attracted to that type of skill.The second reason I got a kick out of watching 'The Closet':  I just learned that 'Bend It Like Beckham' writing partners Gurinder Chadha and Paul Mayeda Berges are prepping a UK re-make for the screen for a targeted 2006 release, with Chadha at the helm.  Her keen eye for comedy tinged with poignancy was confirmed by Beckham's runaway success, so I feel like I'm in on a really great secret knowing she's working on a re-make.",4,I feel like I've tripped on to a nice little secret,1095638400,"09 20, 2004",2004,1302,"['enjoyed', 'Francis', 'Veber', ""'The"", 'Closet', 'released', 'France', '2001', 'two', 'reasons', 'First', 'all-star', 'ensemble', 'French', 'acting', 'certainly', 'tribute', 'Veber', 'skill', 'director', 'Just', 'take', 'gander', 'first', 'six', 'names', 'appear', 'IMDB', 'credits', 'Daniel', 'Auteuil', 'Franois', 'PignonG', 'eacute', 'Depardieu', 'F', 'eacute', 'SantiniThierry', 'Lhermitte', 'GuillaumeMich', 'egrave', 'Laroque', 'Mlle', 'BertrandMichel', 'Aumont', 'Belone', 'neighbourJean', 'Rochefort', 'Kopel', 'directorImagine', 'movie', 'where', 'great', 'Jean', 'Rochefort', 'slotted', 'sixth', 'six', 'stars', 'can', 'carry', 'movie', 'France', 'own', 'back', 'fact', 'group', 'teamed', 'here', 'testament', 'Veber', 'reputation', 'previous', 'release', '1998', ""'The"", 'Dinner', 'Game', 'was', 'lauded', 'far', 'wide', 'comedic', 'masterpiece', 'Actors', 'get', 'attracted', 'type', 'skill.The', 'second', 'reason', 'got', 'kick', 'watching', ""'The"", 'Closet', 'just', 'learned', ""'Bend"", 'Beckham', 'writing', 'partners', 'Gurinder', 'Chadha', 'Paul', 'Mayeda', 'Berges', 'are', 'prepping', 'UK', 're-make', 'screen', 'targeted', '2006', 'release', 'Chadha', 'helm', 'keen', 'eye', 'comedy', 'tinged', 'poignancy', 'was', 'confirmed', 'Beckham', 'runaway', 'success', 'feel', ""'m"", 'really', 'great', 'secret', 'knowing', 'working', 're-make']",The Closet

672994,A3MPEDYM4DGS5O,B00005OSLQ,BigSPEEGS,"[2, 7]","To be sure, Francis Verber has talent. With the wildly funny ""Dinner Game"", he showed that he was able to weave hilarious situational comedy. Unfortunately, ""The Closet"" does not pick up where ""The Dinner Game"" left off. There's nothing awful about it, but in a failed attempt to put a new spin on Verber's creation Francois Pignon, ""The Closet"" never delivers.Francois Pignon (Daniel Auteuil) is considered an idiot by many who work with him at a condom factory and is on the verge of being fired. He gets word of this, and dismayed turns to his new neighbor Belone (Michel Aumont). Belone suggests a tricky scheme to save Pignon's job: pretend that he is gay and the company will never fire him if they want to save their image. The scheme is working, and on the other side of the spectrum there is another prank being played. Homophobe Felix Santini (Gerard Depardieu) is being pressured to act nice to Pignon to save his job, and unexpected things begin to happen.Francois Pignon is one of the funnier characters I have encountered in recent years. In Verber's previous film he was a flat-out idiot, meaning well but always saying the wrong things and the wrong times. In ""The Closet"", everyone calls him an idiot, but I don't buy it. He seems perfectly intelligent to me. Pignon is translated here as a boring punch line without the setup. Much to my surprise, I found that I couldn't care less what happens to him over the course of the film. One of the most valuable pieces of advice I could give to Verber from an audience member's perspective is: if it ain't broke, don't fix it.Only partly because of Pignon's shortcomings does the film fall flat. Most of the jokes just aren't funny. They're the same sort of recycled gay jokes we get all the time in movies. The screenplay feels worn and tired, and what could've been a breath of fresh air becomes recycled and stale. Verber is merely taking an interesting idea and presenting the obvious ""What-ifs"" that immediately pop into one's mind when hearing a synopsis about the film.The acting was incredibly sub-par as well. Daniel Auteuil, who is on the whole a very good actor gives a performance as monotone and boring as Pignon is (see him in ""The Widow of Saint-Pierre"" if you really want to see what he's made of). Gerard Depardieu is fair, but doesn't show enough desperation that we are told Felix so obviously has. Michele Laroque breathes a little more life into her character Mlle Bertrand, Pignon's secretary; she is the highlight of an ensemble that is relatively uninteresting and never shows enough range.""The Closet"" is a wasted opportunity. In situational comedy, we need to care about or at least understand the characters to a certain extent or it will be impossible to laugh when they get into trouble. While Verber seemed like he could handle that, in ""The Closet"" it doesn't seem he believes in his characters; as if he believes that the audience need only take them at face value.

Jarmick ""Word  Lover""","[12, 15]","The writer and director who brought us La Cauge Au Folles and the recent comic cult hit;  The Dinner Game, now delivers the Closet.The Closet is one of the most tasteful politically incorrect French farces I've seen.  Everything is being delivered with such a gentle touch, it's hard to believe this is the same director who delivered the funny but mean spirited Dinner Game.  The film is a little stronger than a television sit-com, but not much. It's an easy film to like--too easy.The Closet stars four of Frances most popular home grown box-office stars and was a huge hit there in late 2000.  It arrived in U.S. theaters in 2001.I laughed quite a bit during the Closet, but as I was watching I also knew the film could have been much better.  There were a lot of missed opportunities and with the cast involved it would have taken a real effort to completely fail to entertain.  I appreciated the decision not to go completely sappy with some of the twists the story took and I think the film is a far better than something like In and Out to whom it's distantly related.Mild mannered, milquetoast, almost invisible Francois Pignon  (Daniel Auteuil) works as an accountant in a condom factory.  He's such a non-entity when there's no room for him in the company picture he sits it out. He's such a nice dull guy, even the most gregarious guy at the company has stopped playing practical jokes on him.Then Francois overhears the gregarious guy Felix Santini (Gerard Depardieu) and his friend Guillaume (Thierry Lhermitte) laughing about the fact that Fancois was about to be fired.  Will anyone even notice?It's the last straw for Francois whose wife left him almost a year ago (though he still loves her) Francois' teenage son avoids him whenever possible, he has no hobbies, or friends  and without a job, he'll be unable to give his wife alimony.  He  contemplates committing suicide.His new neighbor, Belone (Michel Aumont) however be-friends him.  He is retired corporate psychologist and he has a plan to help keep his job.  Using some doctored photos, Belone, creates a rumor at the factory that Francois is gay.  Fearing there could be bad publicity from the gay community which would hurt condom sales, the company can't fire Francois now. Francois boss, the beautiful Mlle. Bertrand (Michele Laroque) is not only suspicious that something doesn't add up, but she's also suddenly intrigued by Francois.Francois long string of bad luck and dullness has come to an end.Everyone's attitude toward  the former invisible employee suddenly changes. Even gregarious homophobe Felix is being nice to him for some reason. Of course complications crop up, but the film is utterly predictable with its twists.The film is tame in tone and the humor pretty gentle. The direction from a visual standpoint is totally lackluster - though comic timing is sharp.  It's really the charisma and skill of the actors (Daniel Auteuil here acts like a French speaking Tony Randall,) that makes this film as successful and funny as it is. They make it worth watching.DVD STUFFThe Closet is presented in anamorphic widescreen with  2.35:1 aspect ratio.  The colors are sharp and very little grain, dirt or print damage is visible.  The black levels seems to be very strong.The soundtrack is clean and free from any distortion or noise.  There's not a lot of sound effects or even appropriate occasions which would use the full spectrum of a home surround system, but the music and ambient noises  are well distributed to create a natural sounding environment. We've all seen foreign films where everyone talks in strange hollow disembodied and over-modulated voices.  That is not the case here.  The film is in French and the English subtitles are very easy to read.DVD EXTRAS:Little is here but three theatrical trailers.BOTTOM LINE:The Closet is an amusing clever French comedy that delivers enjoyable performances.  It should have been better than it is, but if you are looking for something a little different and in the mood to laugh it's certainly worth a look.  If you're put off by subtitles (which are very easy to read on this DVD) then that's you're loss.3 1/2 stars.  It's funny but could have and should have been better.Christopher Jarmick, is the author of The Glass Cocoon with Serena F.

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","THE CLOSET (orig. title LE PLACARD, 2001, 85 minutes) is one of those subtle French comedies I often wish America could get the hang of making. We're not known for subtlety - especially when it comes to the issue of society's view of gay people.Francois Pignon (Daniel Auteuil, who looks like a cross between Tony Randall and Don Knotts) is an accountant for a condom factory. Bland, quiet, disrespected by his peers and frankly offensive simply because he's boring, his job is in jeopardy. When they warn him he is to be fired shortly, he attempts suicide - and is rescued by his elderly neighbor. This wonderful, compassionate man turns out to be gay and has a backstory of his own. It is his brilliant idea to Photoshop some racy pictures showing Francois in a certain style of leather pants, with his boyfriend at a gay bar.This move to save his job will have hilarious, unforeseen consequences, not least of which will be the mental casualties suffered by the factory bully, Felix Santini (Gerard Depardieu who is halfway to becoming the enormous whale he'd end up being). The humor in this film is just fantastic. I enjoyed the cast of characters, who had terrible trouble refraining from using offensive terms for gay people: an honest and true reflection of all Western society. Another example: on the most miserable day, Francois is listening to the radio news, with nothing but disasters, deaths and then the announcer kindly says, ""And the weather is no better!!""Only the French really can pull that off well. At one point, some friends mocking Francois once the word gets around that he is gay, say ""Oh, Pignon is mignon!"" It's funny as hell. It is also a sad, profound statement about how ignorant and callous we all are. The office prattlers, who get the photographs and resent the boss' strategy to be kind because they can lose business if Francois is fired, begin needling Francois. They accuse him of being a pedophile, even though a minute earlier they conclude the photos are doctored and someone is trying to harm Francois.Nice people. Only the boss (the immortal Jean de Rochefort) seems genuinely concerned about all his employees. Meanwhile Santini loses his mind, because he simply cannot stand a world that accepts gay people. The entire time, of course, Francois is a simple, straight man of courage.What I wanted to know after seeing this film is something a little separate: why despise a man for being quiet and ""boring""? We all know ""boring"" people and we may be boring too - what is it with the French automatically hating everyone, thinking the worst?

Happily, his neighbor has a great talent for invention and sends a photo to Auteuil's character Pignon's office revealing him to be gay and something of a ""wild man"" outside of work. Naturally Pignon won't be fired now that his employer thinks he is gay; this will be seen as ostracizing and divisive and prejudiced, singling him out for his sexual orientation.

Daniel Auteuil and Gerard Depardieu are perfectly cast in this terrifically funny look into the change in the life of a boring man who becomes the office celebrity after &quot;coming out&quot;. The film starts with Francois Pignon (Auteuil) facing dismissal from his job. His workmates, his estranged wife and son all ignore him and he is on the verge of ending it all when a new neighbor (Michel Aumont) fortuitously arrives on the scene and tries to save Pignon. He hatches a plan to &quot;expose&quot; the straight Pignon to his workmates in order to engender sympathy and put fear into the minds of those who would fire him. Depardieu is brilliant as the homophobic personnel manager, Santini, who finds himself having to bow and scrape to the now- highly-esteemed Pignon. Unbeknownst to Santini, he has been set up. The office rumour mill is in overdrive and one cannot help but observe the obvious social references of this beautifully constructed little gem.

673010,AUNHTUF4ATEJM,B00005OSLQ,M. C. Crammer,"[5, 5]","The premise of this movie is that a competent but quiet and unexciting accountant (Pignon) is getting fired for no particular reason except someone has to go and he's considered expendable, being something of a zero in the eyes of his employer and coworkers.  The opening scene says it all when he willingly is omitted from the annual company photo of the staff: he will not be missed by anyone.  Pignon is very depressed and considering ending it all when his new neighbor on the adjoining balcony intervenes.  The neighbor has an idea to help him: he should pretend he's gay and then his employer will be too concerned about ""correctness"" to fire him -- they'll bend over backwards to pretend they're not prejudiced.  The neighbor (a retired industrial psychologist) doctors up some photos with the head of the accountant (Pignon) and the bodies of some gays entering a gay night club.  These are sent anonymously to Pignon's boss, and quickly are photocopied and spread throughout the company.  The president quickly decides it would be a very bad strategy to fire Pignon, because these days, they wouldn't want to alienate the gay market, particularly since they make condoms.It sounds like a thin one-joke movie, but the actors are good enough that it's quite amusing and doesn't drag.  Gerard Depardieu (a very funny guy) plays Santini, the captain of the company rugby team who is aggressively heterosexual and makes disparaging remarks about gays constantly.  He's warned that he better buddy up to Pignon (by coworkers who are basically playing a joke on him) or else he'll get fired.  Subplots involve Pignon's relationship with his ex-wife and estranged son.  There is a very funny scene of Pignon in a gay pride parade.The whole film is made less obnoxious by an episode involving gay-bashing (violent) that makes it clear that the subject is really rather serious, even if the film is funny.",4,Pretty funny French film about stereotypes and sexuality,1118966400,"06 17, 2005",2005,1904,"['premise', 'movie', 'competent', 'quiet', 'unexciting', 'accountant', 'Pignon', 'getting', 'fired', 'particular', 'reason', 'someone', 'go', 'considered', 'expendable', 'being', 'something', 'zero', 'eyes', 'employer', 'coworkers', 'opening', 'scene', 'when', 'willingly', 'omitted', 'annual', 'company', 'photo', 'staff', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'anyone', 'Pignon', 'very', 'depressed', 'considering', 'ending', 'when', 'new', 'neighbor', 'adjoining', 'balcony', 'intervenes', 'neighbor', 'idea', 'help', 'should', 'pretend', 'gay', 'then', 'employer', 'will', 'be', 'too', 'concerned', 'correctness', 'fire', ""'ll"", 'bend', 'backwards', 'pretend', ""'re"", 'not', 'prejudiced', 'neighbor', 'retired', 'industrial', 'psychologist', 'up', 'photos', 'head', 'accountant', 'Pignon', 'bodies', 'gays', 'entering', 'gay', 'night', 'club', 'are', 'sent', 'anonymously', 'Pignon', 'boss', 'quickly', 'are', 'photocopied', 'spread', 'company', 'president', 'quickly', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'bad', 'strategy', 'fire', 'Pignon', 'days', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'alienate', 'gay', 'market', 'particularly', 'make', 'condoms.It', 'sounds', 'thin', 'one-joke', 'movie', 'actors', 'are', 'good', 'enough', 'quite', 'amusing', ""n't"", 'drag', 'Gerard', 'Depardieu', 'very', 'funny', 'guy', 'Santini', 'captain', 'company', 'rugby', 'team', 'who', 'aggressively', 'heterosexual', 'disparaging', 'remarks', 'gays', 'constantly', 'warned', 'better', 'buddy', 'up', 'Pignon', 'coworkers', 'who', 'are', 'basically', 'playing', 'joke', 'else', ""'ll"", 'get', 'fired', 'Subplots', 'involve', 'Pignon', 'relationship', 'ex-wife', 'estranged', 'son', 'very', 'funny', 'scene', 'Pignon', 'gay', 'pride', 'parade.The', 'whole', 'film', 'made', 'less', 'obnoxious', 'episode', 'involving', 'gay-bashing', 'violent', 'clear', 'subject', 'really', 'rather', 'serious', 'even', 'film', 'funny']",The Closet

His latest, &quot;The Closet,&quot; features nebbishy accountant Francois--mocked by his colleagues, abandoned by his wife, dissed by his son and about to be fired--who schemes to keep his job by pretending to be gay. Francois' gay psychologist neighbor advises him not to change anything about himself--what will change is other people's perception of him. That's not the only thing that changes in Veber's smoothly written, surefire-as-clockwork farce. Francois' life ends up changing in unforeseen ways, as do the lives of the people around him--particularly that of Santini, the homophobic personnel manager who must suddenly play up to Francois in order to keep his own job. All sorts of crazy complications ensue, and the denouement is appropriately sunny. &quot;The Closet&quot; won't change your life, but it will leave you feeling happy, and you will marvel at the sheer star power lavished on this lightweight tale. Daniel Auteuil and Gerard Depardieu, France's answer to Kevin Spacey and Robert De Niro, play Francois and Santini; in the supporting cast are Thierry Lhermitte, Michel Aumont and Jean Rochefort, which is roughly equivalent to having Richard Gere, Gene Hackman and Michael Caine in the supporting cast of an English-language movie. These superb professionals know exactly what is required of them, and deliver it gift-wrapped. As crazed as the comedy gets, it is the quiet individual moments that will really leave you rolling in the aisles: whether it's Auteuil's sick embarrassment at sitting on a Gay Pride float wearing a condom hat, or Depardieu's blissed-out, zombie stare as his world crumbles around him, you know that you are in the hands of master farceurs.",4,"An archetypal French farce, glittering with star power.",1000598400,"09 16, 2001",2001,1819,"['Francis', 'Veber', 'King', 'French', 'Farce', 'cranking', 'out', 'rate', 'would', 'boggle', 'even', 'mind', 'Georges', 'Feydeau', 'latest', 'quot', 'Closet', 'quot', 'features', 'nebbishy', 'accountant', 'Francois', 'mocked', 'colleagues', 'abandoned', 'wife', 'dissed', 'son', 'be', 'fired', 'who', 'keep', 'job', 'pretending', 'be', 'gay', 'Francois', 'gay', 'psychologist', 'neighbor', 'not', 'change', 'anything', 'what', 'will', 'change', 'other', 'people', 'perception', 'not', 'only', 'thing', 'Veber', 'smoothly', 'written', 'surefire-as-clockwork', 'farce', 'Francois', 'life', 'up', 'changing', 'unforeseen', 'ways', 'do', 'lives', 'people', 'particularly', 'Santini', 'homophobic', 'personnel', 'manager', 'who', 'must', 'suddenly', 'play', 'up', 'Francois', 'order', 'keep', 'own', 'job', 'sorts', 'crazy', 'complications', 'ensue', 'denouement', 'appropriately', 'sunny', 'quot', 'Closet', 'quot', 'wo', ""n't"", 'change', 'life', 'will', 'leave', 'feeling', 'happy', 'will', 'marvel', 'sheer', 'star', 'power', 'lavished', 'lightweight', 'tale', 'Daniel', 'Auteuil', 'Gerard', 'Depardieu', 'France', 'answer', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'play', 'Francois', 'Santini', 'supporting', 'cast', 'are', 'Thierry', 'Lhermitte', 'Michel', 'Aumont', 'Jean', 'Rochefort', 'roughly', 'equivalent', 'having', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'supporting', 'cast', 'English-language', 'movie', 'superb', 'professionals', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'required', 'deliver', 'gift-wrapped', 'As', 'crazed', 'comedy', 'quiet', 'individual', 'moments', 'will', 'really', 'leave', 'rolling', 'aisles', 'Auteuil', 'sick', 'embarrassment', 'sitting', 'Gay', 'Pride', 'float', 'wearing', 'condom', 'hat', 'Depardieu', 'blissed-out', 'zombie', 'stare', 'world', 'know', 'are', 'hands', 'master', 'farceurs']",The Closet

Veber did not intend to repeat the same formula he used in Diner Des Cons, but give us a story about another Pignon, in a different context and situation.There is more poignancy in the Closet,and it is a bittersweet comedy, like the French can only make.The pretext of pretentious gayness to keep his job, is only a backdrop to Pignon's predicament at the hand of society, but it is a very clever insight nevertheless, into the corporate atmosphere and political correctness vs homophobia.Yet what I found very interesting about the gay angle, is how Pignon discovers a strenght and confidence he never thought he had by pretending to be gay.The way his colleagues and family react to him, from ridicule, to excessive friendliness, to pride, (from his own son, thinking it is very cool), is very interesting.The acting I though was very good. Assembling some of the best French working actors today , including Depardieu, Rochefort, Lhermitte and of course Auteuil.He plays Pignon in a straight faced manner..but not boring as some reviewer saw it, because his performance reflects so well the character he is playing. All Pignons are boring! Whereas in Diner Des Cons, Pignon had the gift of talking! even in the wrong moments, saying the wrong things, and entertaining the viewer in the process, Pignon of Closet had deep anxieties, and he shows them.The beauty about Francois Pignon is that he triumphs at the end. He saves the day..manages to make people happy, or clear the mess he put himself or others in, becoming the most unlikely hero. and this is Veber's triumph and with it The Closet.It is a wonderful film, that I hope Hollywood will not remake, because all Veber's american remakes,(Three Fugitives, The Toy, Birdcage) even the ones he directed himself, lose their magic,the magic of Francois Pignon.",5,To all the Pignons of this world,1025827200,"07 5, 2002",2002,2694,"['Who', 'Francois', 'Pignon', 'character', 'Francis', 'Veber', 'used', 'many', 'films', 'La', 'Chevre', 'excellent', 'Diner', 'Des', 'Cons', 'again', 'latest', 'Le', 'Placard/The', 'Closet.Pignon', 'always', 'lonely', 'man', 'separated', 'divorced', 'friends', 'social', 'life', 'accident', 'prone', 'short', 'down', 'luck', 'average', 'man', 'living', 'dull', 'existence', 'invariably', 'oddity', 'society', 'people', 'good', 'looks', 'success', 'professionally', 'socially..The', 'very', 'type', 'people', 'look', 'down', 'Pignon', 'make', 'fun', 'him..Hero', 'vs', 'Hero.This', 'Francois', 'Pignon', 'Veber', 'character', 'films', 'should', 'be', 'looked', 'context', 'regardless', 'one', 'film', 'funnier', 'other.Certainly', 'Diner', 'Des', 'Cons', 'funnier', 'Closet', 'expect', 'same', 'then', 'will', 'look', 'Veber', 'latest', 'less', 'enthusiasm', 'appreciate', 'less', 'Veber', 'did', 'not', 'intend', 'repeat', 'same', 'formula', 'used', 'Diner', 'Des', 'Cons', 'give', 'story', 'Pignon', 'different', 'context', 'situation.There', 'more', 'poignancy', 'Closet', 'bittersweet', 'comedy', 'French', 'can', 'only', 'make.The', 'pretext', 'pretentious', 'gayness', 'keep', 'job', 'only', 'backdrop', 'Pignon', 'predicament', 'hand', 'society', 'very', 'clever', 'insight', 'nevertheless', 'corporate', 'atmosphere', 'political', 'correctness', 'vs', 'homophobia.Yet', 'what', 'found', 'very', 'interesting', 'gay', 'angle', 'how', 'Pignon', 'strenght', 'confidence', 'never', 'thought', 'had', 'pretending', 'be', 'gay.The', 'way', 'colleagues', 'family', 'react', 'ridicule', 'excessive', 'friendliness', 'pride', 'own', 'son', 'thinking', 'very', 'cool', 'very', 'interesting.The', 'acting', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'Assembling', 'best', 'French', 'working', 'actors', 'today', 'including', 'Depardieu', 'Rochefort', 'Lhermitte', 'course', 'Auteuil.He', 'Pignon', 'straight', 'faced', 'not', 'boring', 'reviewer', 'saw', 'performance', 'so', 'well', 'character', 'playing', 'Pignons', 'are', 'boring', 'Whereas', 'Diner', 'Des', 'Cons', 'Pignon', 'had', 'gift', 'talking', 'even', 'wrong', 'moments', 'saying', 'wrong', 'things', 'entertaining', 'viewer', 'process', 'Pignon', 'Closet', 'had', 'deep', 'anxieties', 'them.The', 'beauty', 'Francois', 'Pignon', 'end', 'day..manages', 'make', 'people', 'happy', 'clear', 'mess', 'put', 'others', 'becoming', 'most', 'unlikely', 'hero', 'Veber', 'triumph', 'Closet.It', 'wonderful', 'film', 'hope', 'Hollywood', 'will', 'not', 'remake', 'Veber', 'american', 'remakes', 'Three', 'Fugitives', 'Toy', 'Birdcage', 'even', 'ones', 'directed', 'lose', 'magic', 'magic', 'Francois', 'Pignon']",The Closet

His ex-wife and son want nothing to do with him, just keep the checks coming please, and he's so colorless, he's already the invisible man at work.  But, with the aid of his neighbor Belone, played by the veteran French actor Michel Aumont (The Woman in Blue), Pignon cooks up the tale that he is homosexual, thereby preventing his employers from discharging him, due to anti-discrimination legislation.  Felix Santini, a macho coworker who harasses Pignon until he begins to worry about his own job safety, is played by the wonderful Gerard Depardieu (Green Card).  The bemused boss of the company, Kopel, is played by another French veteran, Jean Rochefort (Mr. Bean's Holiday Gift Set).  And there's a featured performance from a darling little gray kitten.The movie is set in modern-day Paris, but largely in its suburbs and office parks, which we don't really get to see very often over here.  People live in apartment blocks, and drive cars; office parks have parking lots.  It's nicely filmed, and gives us an interesting world.  Plus, it's warm, charming, and funny, though extremely light, and funniest the first time around.  But it's utterly conventional at heart.

With the assistance of a gay neighbour, divorced, dejected and downtrodden accountant Francois Pignon dishonestly ""outs"" himself in a desperate attempt to save his job at the condom factory.  As his newly-adopted sexuality transforms his professional and personal life, Pignon finds that being different in today's pro-diversity culture is no longer a disadvantage - it can actually make you cool.  The wonderfully versatile Daniel Auteuil is terrific as Pignon, as is Gerard D&eacute;pardieu as the confused oaf Santini.  Writer/director Francis Veber's neat little screenplay pushes the concept about as far as it will go (but thankfully no further), escalating the implications of Pignon's ruse without ever resorting to slapstick histrionics.  He also finds a nicely emotional through-line in a subplot about Pignon's relationship with his son.

Yes, the last two Hollywood outings are actually remakes of his works, and though not all of his films are masterpieces, ""The Closet"" alone would make you remember his name.  This film is that funny.Daniel Auteuil is M. Pignon, who has been working for a condom factory as an accountant for 20 years, now he happens to learn that he is going to be fired.  Shocked by the news, he thinks of jumping from the window to kill himself when an old man living in the next room gives a tip; ""pretend you're gay.""  For political reasons (and commercial ones too) the company cannot fire him as they are afraid of being accused of having discriminating attitudes.  It succeeds, and M. Pignon is happy ... for a while.Because unexpected things happen like chain reaction; ""sexual harrassment"" from his beautiful female boss (she has her own reason), sexual advance from his co-worker and rugby coach (he has his own reason, too), and so on.  The story goes on with twists and turns, finally leading to the confidence newly established in M. Pignon.Though the ending is not as good as it should be, and some parts are a bit incredible, the cast is so great that those flaws are all ignored in the end.  Daniel Auteuil's dead-pan humor is always effective, and funniest is his face when he is in a parade wearing a huge tip of condom on his head.  Also humorous is Gerard Depardieu, whose character experiences a total transformation.""The Closet"" has some satire on our attitude about sexuality, but it doesn't preach them.  Rather, the film handles them with a lighter tough, which avoids the pitfall of being too gloomy or philosophical.  The fact is, the film is too light for some; and clearly the director hesitates to push some interesting points the film presents.  But ""The Closet"" should be about M. Pignon, who, just like the protagonist of the same name in ""The Dinner Game,"" is about Mr. Everyman.  His journey to a new life is what we see, and we enjoy watching.

Upon returning home he informs his ex-wife and son of his pending predicament and vows to find another job in order to keep them in alimony. He meets a new neighbor (Michel Aumont) who convinces him not to jump from his balcony and the fun soon begins. Together they concoct a story to save his job believing that if he can convince his company that he is really gay he will save his position by suggesting a prejudice exists. The company sends its dogs out to fend off any chance of a lawsuit and uses the services of its most macho employee (Gerard Depardieu) to ""romance"" away any perceived distaste for the new discovery. From here the story spins and weaves into a web of hilarious lies that will have you rolling on the floor in laughter.This film is so well written and easy to follow that the sub-titles are easily accepted by even the most English of all English speakers.
