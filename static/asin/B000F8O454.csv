I could get a better performance out of a class full of kindergardners. This thing will STINK up your house. DO NOT waste your time and money getting anywhere near this stink bomb. What a joke. I am not sure why it was made. The story line, if you can call it that was even less than weak, dialogue was hysterical, acting if you can call it that.. well a dog licking its butt would have been more entertaining. I am still in shock after watching this disaster!!

This movie looks interesting from the cover but who can buy a movie based on the cover alone?
