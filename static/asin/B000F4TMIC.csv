Even movies that are not very good are somewhat of an accomplishment. That having been said, this movie sucked.  What could have been a promising concept turned out to be a boring film that lacked energy and imagination.The sad thing is, that it would have taken only a few changes to make this a better film (or at least more interesting). The writing was just so poor, and the casting of the male leads can only be explained by nepotism (which isn't always a bad thing; sometimes it's the best or only way circumstances will permit). I rented this film, thinking it would be a scary Jumanji-type premise, (and hoping to see some naked women, since they were all fairly attractive).

A plot that makes little or if any sense; actors whose talents are minimal; and sloppy direction and editing.  Three witches back in the mid-seventies were killed during some kind of ritual, but we're not really sure what, and even though by the end of the film, we ""kinda"" figure out who killed them, it still doesn't make a whole lot of sense.  Then we have the typical group of college students (none who look under the age of 30) who for whatever reason decide to go spend a weekend at this camp where the witches died, and lo and behold, they find some kind of weird game which releases the witches and spells doom for the cast.

No breaking of traditions here-- the plot is stock, the conventions of the horror film are all out in spades, we get the obligatory twist ending, etc. The movie does have one redeeming feature in that it does manage to be funny every now and again, but the humor can't carry the storyline by itself. This is, after all, supposed to be a horror film (and if it were supposed to be more comedy than horror, there's not enough of the comedy angle). Technically, it's decent, though I wonder how hard it is to shoot when most of the movie takes place in the dark. (Though from some of the horribly-lit movies I've seen recently, I think it may be more difficult than I assumed it was.) Acting is a cut below average, but at least everyone seems to have been having a good time with the ludicrous script. Maybe worth it when you've got a sixpack and a free evening in front of you, but not one to go out of your way for. **",2,Mediocre supernatural slasher.,1219104000,"08 19, 2008",2008,1067,"['Ghost', 'Game', 'Joe', 'Knee', '2004', 'Mediocre', 'supernatural', 'horror', 'flick', 'bunch', 'young-and-beautifuls', 'stuck', 'island', 'malevolent', 'spirits', 'breaking', 'traditions', 'here', 'plot', 'stock', 'conventions', 'horror', 'film', 'are', 'out', 'spades', 'get', 'obligatory', 'twist', 'ending', 'etc', 'movie', 'have', 'one', 'redeeming', 'feature', 'manage', 'be', 'funny', 'now', 'again', 'humor', 'ca', ""n't"", 'carry', 'storyline', 'supposed', 'be', 'horror', 'film', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'more', 'comedy', 'horror', 'not', 'enough', 'comedy', 'angle', 'Technically', 'decent', 'wonder', 'how', 'hard', 'shoot', 'when', 'most', 'movie', 'place', 'dark', 'horribly-lit', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recently', 'think', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'difficult', 'assumed', 'was', 'Acting', 'cut', 'below', 'average', 'least', 'everyone', 'have', 'been', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'ludicrous', 'script', 'Maybe', 'when', ""'ve"", 'got', 'sixpack', 'free', 'evening', 'front', 'not', 'one', 'go', 'way', '**']",Ghost Game

But I have to say that the dialogue and the characters in the beginning kept my attention long enough for me to get into the plot of the movie (which is more than I can say for the three B-movies we shut off about 5 minutes into them before we got to this one).  It's a 20 something's in the woods with a supernatural killer on the lose movie, so you know the story already.  However every time my wife and I said ""You know this is what is going to happen"" and thought we had it figured out we were surprised with a little twist, not a plot twist but just that these guys didn't follow the exact same formula as every other movie of this genre. Up until the very end we kept saying ""This is what is going to have to happen, it's what always happens"" and then we would be wrong.

983211,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B000F4TMIC,Tim Janson,"[9, 11]","Not absolutely horrible but not much above.  Ghost Game at least gets a ""C"" for a concept that brings its overall rating to two stars rather than just one.  A group of friends decides to take a camping trip to an old cabin in the middle of nowhere ala so many 1980's slasher films.  Once there they find an old game and decide to play.  Through the course of the game they release the spirits of three witches who died while performing some kind of ceremony or spell years earlier.  Soon they begin killing the campers and the group realizes they have to keep playing the game to try and save themselves.  It's not a bad concept but unfortunately there was nothing behind the production to make it rise above others in the Z budget field.Films shot on video just plain suck and there is no way around it.  It just looks plain amateurish no matter how good the actors may be.  Not to say the actors were good...but they were not horrible.  They were handcuffed by poor scripting.  It's the usual horror movie stereotypical roles.  The women in the film are reasonably attractive as cheap films go and several of them do have numerous TV credits in their background so it's not like they were just found on the street.  I'll chalk this one up to the director as there was an OK concept but there was no sense of pacing or tension built up.
