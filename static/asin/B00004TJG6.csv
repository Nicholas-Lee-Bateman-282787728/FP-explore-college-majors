Somehow, I think this series could have been good, but it just isn't. The voice actress who plays Nanako is just plain annoying. If you're looking for fan service, you'll find some, although not much.

Hammond,"[5, 6]","I wasn't expecting the sub-plot about Nanako which actually puts this over in the Steel Angel Kurumi/Chobits school of unreal girls(Only seen 1 Saber Marionette, so I can't include it). Dr. Kyoji is pretty cute for a mad scientist(ok, not so mad as obsessed). Nanako gets a tad annoying at times with how incredibly thick she can be, but it's a fun show. Yes, Dr. Kyoji's abusive, but there's a reason for his pushing her(& it's not to cut her up--he gave up on that idea apparently). In fact, some of it seems to be humor(of the Princess Bride's ""I'll likely kill you in the morning"" Dread Pirate Roberts mode)I bought the set & watched them all together so it makes sense. Want to think as well as laugh, get Soul Hunter. This one's just a fun, sweet show about a boy, his favorite maid, & a pinky-promise to save her.",4,Not bad for a jiggle show,1044144000,"02 2, 2003",2003,820,"['was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'sub-plot', 'Nanako', 'actually', 'Steel', 'Angel', 'Kurumi/Chobits', 'school', 'unreal', 'girls', 'Only', 'seen', '1', 'Saber', 'Marionette', 'ca', ""n't"", 'include', 'Dr.', 'Kyoji', 'pretty', 'cute', 'mad', 'scientist', 'ok', 'not', 'so', 'mad', 'obsessed', 'Nanako', 'tad', 'annoying', 'times', 'how', 'incredibly', 'thick', 'can', 'be', 'fun', 'show', 'Yes', 'Dr.', 'Kyoji', 'abusive', 'reason', 'pushing', 'not', 'cut', 'up', 'gave', 'up', 'idea', 'apparently', 'fact', 'be', 'humor', 'Princess', 'Bride', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'kill', 'morning', 'Dread', 'Pirate', 'Roberts', 'mode', 'bought', 'set', 'watched', 'together', 'sense', 'Want', 'think', 'as', 'well', 'laugh', 'get', 'Soul', 'Hunter', 'one', 'just', 'fun', 'sweet', 'show', 'boy', 'favorite', 'maid', 'pinky-promise', 'save']",N/A
550312,A3PYAKA7270DI3,B00004TJG6,Mitchell Glodek,"[10, 12]","I won't bother to criticize &quot;Nanako&quot; for being sexist; a sexist anime could very easily be funny, or exciting, or interesting.  Unfortunately, &quot;Nanako&quot; is not that hypothetically amusing, thrilling, engrossing sexist anime, but an incredibly dull sexist anime.  The jokes (mostly tired slapstick showing how stupid Nanako is or how bad a cook she is, or scenes of Nanako's boss angrily beating her or Nanako screaming in fear when confronted by aliens or wild animals) are not funny, the action really drags, and the plot almost seems non-existant.  (Perhaps it picks up in the later episodes; this disk has two episodes.)  As for the art, Nanako herself is sort of charming, but the other character designs are as forgettable as the bland personalities affixed to them.&quot;Nanako&quot; has a real problem with tone; mostly, it is supposed to be a comedy, I suppose, but the violence can be very graphic, and there are overtones of X-Files/Evangelion &quot;secret government experiments involving aliens&quot; which don't fit in very well with the endless scenes of Nanako's breasts bouncing as she falls down.The best part of the disk are the episode closing credits in which we see Nanako doing various exercizes; Nanako is a nice drawing stuck in a terrible lemon of an anime.",2,Yawn.,989366400,"05 9, 2001",2001,1301,"['wo', ""n't"", 'bother', 'criticize', 'quot', 'Nanako', 'quot', 'being', 'sexist', 'sexist', 'anime', 'could', 'very', 'easily', 'be', 'funny', 'exciting', 'interesting', 'Unfortunately', 'quot', 'Nanako', 'quot', 'not', 'hypothetically', 'amusing', 'thrilling', 'engrossing', 'sexist', 'anime', 'incredibly', 'dull', 'sexist', 'anime', 'jokes', 'mostly', 'tired', 'slapstick', 'showing', 'how', 'stupid', 'Nanako', 'how', 'bad', 'cook', 'scenes', 'Nanako', 'boss', 'angrily', 'beating', 'Nanako', 'screaming', 'fear', 'when', 'confronted', 'aliens', 'wild', 'animals', 'are', 'not', 'funny', 'action', 'really', 'plot', 'almost', 'non-existant', 'Perhaps', 'up', 'later', 'episodes', 'disk', 'two', 'episodes', 'art', 'Nanako', 'sort', 'charming', 'other', 'character', 'designs', 'are', 'as', 'forgettable', 'bland', 'personalities', 'affixed', 'them.', 'quot', 'Nanako', 'quot', 'real', 'problem', 'tone', 'mostly', 'supposed', 'be', 'comedy', 'suppose', 'violence', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'graphic', 'are', 'overtones', 'X-Files/Evangelion', 'quot', 'secret', 'government', 'experiments', 'involving', 'aliens', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'fit', 'very', 'well', 'endless', 'scenes', 'Nanako', 'breasts', 'bouncing', 'down.The', 'best', 'part', 'disk', 'are', 'episode', 'closing', 'credits', 'see', 'Nanako', 'doing', 'various', 'exercizes', 'Nanako', 'nice', 'drawing', 'stuck', 'terrible', 'lemon', 'anime']",N/A

It is pretty funny and has asomewhat interesting (if yet unrevealed) plot, cool music, funny characters, and some pretty decent art (if not animation). However, it is obvious this title is geared mainly at male audiences.In the first episode there is some almost-ultraviolence, and in the second their is some nudity. That may not sound so bad, but I have to tell you that every scene that features Nanako has fan service. If your 14 or up, I recomend this to you.
