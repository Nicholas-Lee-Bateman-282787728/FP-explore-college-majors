1535595,A1O1HWFO5Q9PJ0,B007P3SLHE,"A. J. ""adahl-Korean drama enthusiast""","[0, 0]","This was quite a decent love story. It is not a mad passionate romance, but moves slowly and one is not quite sure how it will turn out. I loved the inn and the scenery was beautiful. Snow is certainly more romantic than a rain storm when one is outside. It was a relaxing movie. The fact that the actors are quite attractive didn't hurt the plot either. I enjoyed it.",3,Great scenery.

My husband and I enjoyed watching this show. It was sweet and innocent without bad language or sex with a completely unexpected ending.,5,sweet story,1383868800,"11 8, 2013",2013,249,"['only', 'thing', 'would', 'make', 'show', 'better', 'would', 'be', 'was', 'done', 'English', 'maybe', 'acting', 'husband', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'show', 'was', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'bad', 'language', 'sex', 'completely', 'unexpected', 'ending']",Romancing in Thin Air Blu-Ray (Region A) (English Subtitled) Johnnie To
1535597,A1EBJKTH0V0YKH,B007P3SLHE,Fiction Writer,"[4, 4]","Just finished watching this film a couple minutes ago. The cinematography is beautiful, as is the location and the music. There are times when the story feels cut, as if scenes have been deleted in editing, so I would like to see an extended version, but the story is solid. The characters are believable, and the romance doesn't include the bedroom, but happens outside it, in the subtleties of everyday life. Definitely adding this one to my video library.",5,Beautiful,1370304000,"06 4, 2013",2013,458,"['Just', 'finished', 'watching', 'film', 'couple', 'minutes', 'ago', 'cinematography', 'beautiful', 'location', 'music', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'story', 'feels', 'cut', 'scenes', 'have', 'been', 'deleted', 'editing', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'extended', 'version', 'story', 'solid', 'characters', 'are', 'believable', 'romance', ""n't"", 'include', 'bedroom', 'subtleties', 'everyday', 'life', 'Definitely', 'adding', 'one', 'video', 'library']",Romancing in Thin Air Blu-Ray (Region A) (English Subtitled) Johnnie To

Filmed in a part of the world I know very little about - Shangri-La - it explores life where oxygen is thin, the forest a menacing place where it's easy to get lost, the difference between public and private personas, grief and healing, friendship and love.

1535601,A2R9KH3KC9VDKG,B007P3SLHE,The Happy Artist,"[5, 5]","If you're reading this review it's probably because you are trying to decide if you should watch this. I invested my 2 hours and felt like it was well worth it. It's a wonderfully written and acted romance movie from China. In my opinion just as good as anything coming out of Hollywood these days (at least as far as romance/love story type movies.)Interesting story: Man on the rebound falls for the the grieving 'never gives up hope' woman not willing to admit she's a widow yet. They help each other with their emotional demons and fall in love, but have to overcome so many roadblocks to get there.Well acted, sympathetic characters,  all in all pretty good. No sex, violence, cursing or nudity. Just drama and romance. 2 hankie ending.",5,Nice opportunity to see a movie you won't get locally or on TV,1367107200,"04 28, 2013",2013,741,"[""'re"", 'reading', 'review', 'probably', 'are', 'trying', 'decide', 'should', 'watch', 'invested', '2', 'hours', 'felt', 'was', 'well', 'worth', 'wonderfully', 'written', 'acted', 'romance', 'movie', 'China', 'opinion', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'anything', 'coming', 'Hollywood', 'days', 'least', 'as', 'far', 'romance/love', 'story', 'type', 'movies', 'Interesting', 'story', 'Man', 'rebound', 'grieving', 'up', 'hope', 'woman', 'not', 'willing', 'admit', 'widow', 'yet', 'help', 'other', 'emotional', 'demons', 'fall', 'love', 'have', 'overcome', 'so', 'many', 'roadblocks', 'get', 'there.Well', 'acted', 'sympathetic', 'characters', 'pretty', 'good', 'sex', 'violence', 'cursing', 'nudity', 'Just', 'drama', 'romance', '2', 'hankie', 'ending']",Romancing in Thin Air Blu-Ray (Region A) (English Subtitled) Johnnie To
