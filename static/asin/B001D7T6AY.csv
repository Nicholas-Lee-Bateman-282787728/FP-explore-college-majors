Chaney,"[2, 2]","I recently watched ""The Memory Keeper's Daughter"" because I had always wanted to read the book but never got around to it, so I thought the movie would be a good substitute.  I was wrong.This made for Lifetime TV Movie feels more like half a story than a full movie.  At points you can see that there is a good story that underlies the film, but the script doesn't take the time to develop the characters or explore the emotional aspects of the story, and without these pieces you can't make a really great film.  Instead, the movie is paced like a TV show, quickly jumping between key events with little or no plot or character development.  You are left wondering why certain characters act as they do as the story quickly moves to the next plot point.  The movie also has a high made-for-TV cheese factor, with plenty of over acting and dramatic music.I wish the ""Memory Keeper's Daughter"" had received better treatment--writing, directing, acting, etc--because I really do think it could have been a good film.  I'm still interested in reading the book, even though I was soundly disappointed by this adaptation.",2,"A Good Story, But It's Ruined by the Made-for-TV Cheese Factor",1225152000,"10 28, 2008",2008,1116,"['recently', 'watched', 'Memory', 'Keeper', 'Daughter', 'had', 'always', 'wanted', 'read', 'book', 'never', 'got', 'thought', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'substitute', 'was', 'wrong.This', 'made', 'Lifetime', 'TV', 'Movie', 'more', 'story', 'full', 'movie', 'points', 'can', 'see', 'good', 'story', 'film', 'script', ""n't"", 'take', 'time', 'develop', 'characters', 'explore', 'emotional', 'aspects', 'story', 'pieces', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'really', 'great', 'film', 'Instead', 'movie', 'paced', 'TV', 'show', 'quickly', 'jumping', 'key', 'events', 'little', 'plot', 'character', 'development', 'are', 'left', 'wondering', 'why', 'certain', 'characters', 'act', 'do', 'story', 'quickly', 'next', 'plot', 'point', 'movie', 'also', 'high', 'made-for-TV', 'cheese', 'factor', 'plenty', 'acting', 'dramatic', 'music.I', 'wish', 'Memory', 'Keeper', 'Daughter', 'had', 'received', 'better', 'treatment', 'writing', 'directing', 'acting', 'etc', 'really', 'do', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'film', ""'m"", 'still', 'interested', 'reading', 'book', 'even', 'was', 'soundly', 'disappointed', 'adaptation']",The Memory Keeper's Daughter

The story is set in the 1960s and involves a doctor, David Henry, whose wife, Norah, goes into labour during a snowstorm. Unable to get to the hospital, he takes her to his surgery, where his nurse, Caroline Gil, assists with the birth. Norah delivers twins, a boy, Paul, and a girl, Phoebe: the boy is perfect, the girl is obviously mongoloid. Convinced that his wife will be unable to cope with their daughter's disability, he tells Caroline to take Phoebe to a children's home, and later tells his wife the baby did not survive. Caroline, unable to bring herself to leave Phoebe as instructed, takes her away to another town and decides to bring her up as her own daughter. This is a very moving tale, which loses none of its impact by being made into a movie. Whilst a movie can never totally encompass a book's content, the movie plot is quite faithful to the book.

1179630,A328S9RN3U5M68,B001D7T6AY,Grady Harp,"[12, 15]","THE MEMORY KEEPER'S DAUGHTER in the form of a novel by Kim Edwards was a highly successful bestseller and probably was featured in more reading groups than any other novel during its circulation.  So what happened when the novel became a made-for-television movie?  Perhaps it is the below mediocre screenplay (oops!, teleplay!) by John Pielmeier that consistently galumphs along in an awkward pedestrian fashion removing all sense of credibility to the story. Perhaps it is the cut and paste direction by Mick Jackson that misses the pacing and character delineation. Perhaps it suffers from the cinematography of an uncredited source or the 'liquid tears' musical score by Daniel Licht. For whatever of these (or all of these) reasons, this novel-to-film survives because it does make a good case for educating the public about the capabilities of those born with Down Syndrome.  And for that it is worthy of attention.Dr. David Henry (Dermot Mulroney), a successful orthopedic doctor, is married to the beautiful Norah (Gretchen Mol) and their lives are becoming changed by their pregnancy.  On a stormy winter night in Kentucky Norah goes into labor and the Henry's rush to a nearby clinic where David delivers his wife (the doctor is caught in a snowstorm) with the assistance of his old friend, nurse Caroline Gill (Emily Watson).  After the delivery of a perfect boy child (Paul) Norah continues to be in labor and (surprisingly...)  delivers an unexpected (!) twin girl.  David and Caroline immediately recognize that the little girl (Phoebe) is a 'mongoloid' (this is before the use of the term Down Syndrome) and David, having a history of losing a little sister because of a birth defect) decides to send Phoebe to an asylum for the mentally challenged: Caroline is to make the delivery and Norah is told the second twin died at birth.Caroline follows instructions, sees the conditions of the 'home' where Phoebe is to be deposited, shrinks in horror, and decides to keep the child.  Aided by a friendly trucker, Caroline changes her solitary existence and mothers Phoebe, finding a new life in her trucker's Pittsburgh.  Norah insists on a formal funeral for Phoebe - a fact that deeply disturbs David's psyche, and the Henry's life goes on with only the one child Paul, leaving submerged pains about the lack of Phoebe's presence.  Norah gifts David with a camera ('peoples lives are like a camera, that's where they live - in a room captured by a moment') and David becomes obsessed with photography.  Norah grieves, drinks, and loses David's attention, while David traces Phoebe's existence with Caroline - sending money and letters to Pittsburgh.  Paul (Tyler Stentiford to Jamie Spilchuk) grows up, discovers his mother's infidelities and is angered about his father's lack of communication and understanding, and decides to fulfill his goal of becoming a musician, and off to Juilliard he goes.  Meanwhile Phoebe (Krystal Hope Nausbaum) has matured into a very highly adapted young girl, and the manner in which the broken marriage of the Henrys happens and the healing atmosphere of Phoebe's and Paul's lives  coupled with the courage that has supported Caroline Gill's struggle to gain acceptance in the world for those born with Down Syndrome forms the conclusion of the film.The cast of well-known actors tries hard, but only Emily Watson is able to resurrect a credible character from this squishy script.  Jamie Spilchuk gives evidence of a young actor with much promise.  Dermot Mulroney and Gretchen find it difficult to mold empathetic characters form the corny lines they are given to deliver. The film is a mess, but the message about acceptance of Down Syndrome children and adults is an important one.

1179635,A19Q59T3Y3WF1V,B001D7T6AY,Patrice Fagnant-macarthur,"[0, 0]","The Memory Keeper's Daughter is a Lifetime Original Movie available on DVD. It is based on the best-selling novel by the same name by Kim Edwards. Starring Dermot Mulroney, Gretchen Mol, and Emily Watson, it offers a very positive portrayal of a girl with Down Syndrome.  In a world in which the majority of children diagnosed with Down Syndrome in utero are aborted, these positive portrayals are desperately needed in order to help change hearts and minds.In 1964, Dr. David Henry (Mulroney) delivered his wife's twins. His son was born healthy and normal while his daughter was born with Down Syndrome. Dr. Henry has experience with Down Syndrome - his younger sister had it and died at an early age from a heart malformation. He saw his mother's heartbreak and does not want his wife to suffer the same fate. His wife is unconscious at this point and he makes the quick decision to hand over his daughter to a nurse, Caroline Gill (Watson) to be taken to a home. He then tells his wife that their daughter died.When the nurse goes to the home, she is so horrified by what she encounters that she can't leave the baby, instead choosing to move away and raise her herself. The movie follows the two families over the course of the next twenty years- the Henrys slow implosion as Dr. Henry suffers under the weight of his secret and his wife never recovers from her grief of a daughter lost, contrasted with the beauty of the growing Pheobe thriving under the care of her adoptive mother.While this movie is unrated, it is intended for older teens and adults. While there are no sex scenes, adulterous relationships are part of the story. The acting is also slightly uneven in parts. Nevertheless, the pro-life message of this movie that all life is valuable and precious makes it one worth watching. Gill's fight to gain educational rights for her daughter is also inspiring. She exhibits much faith and determination and works hard to help her daughter become all that she can be.The Memory Keeper's Daughter will foster much discussion and will definitely tug at your heart. If you have not already seen it or read the book, I highly recommend adding it to your ""to-be-watched"" list.",4,Definitely Worth Watching,1346544000,"09 2, 2012",2012,2187,"['Memory', 'Keeper', 'Daughter', 'Lifetime', 'Original', 'Movie', 'available', 'DVD', 'based', 'best-selling', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Kim', 'Edwards', 'Starring', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'Gretchen', 'Mol', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'very', 'positive', 'portrayal', 'girl', 'Down', 'Syndrome', 'world', 'majority', 'children', 'diagnosed', 'Down', 'Syndrome', 'utero', 'are', 'aborted', 'positive', 'portrayals', 'are', 'desperately', 'needed', 'order', 'help', 'change', 'hearts', 'minds.In', '1964', 'Dr.', 'David', 'Henry', 'Mulroney', 'delivered', 'wife', 'twins', 'son', 'was', 'born', 'healthy', 'normal', 'daughter', 'was', 'born', 'Down', 'Syndrome', 'Dr.', 'Henry', 'experience', 'Down', 'Syndrome', 'younger', 'sister', 'had', 'died', 'early', 'age', 'heart', 'malformation', 'saw', 'mother', 'heartbreak', 'not', 'want', 'wife', 'suffer', 'same', 'fate', 'wife', 'unconscious', 'point', 'quick', 'decision', 'hand', 'daughter', 'nurse', 'Caroline', 'Gill', 'Watson', 'be', 'taken', 'home', 'then', 'wife', 'daughter', 'nurse', 'home', 'so', 'horrified', 'what', 'ca', ""n't"", 'leave', 'baby', 'instead', 'choosing', 'move', 'away', 'raise', 'movie', 'two', 'families', 'course', 'next', 'twenty', 'years-', 'Henrys', 'slow', 'implosion', 'Dr.', 'Henry', 'suffers', 'weight', 'secret', 'wife', 'never', 'recovers', 'grief', 'daughter', 'lost', 'contrasted', 'beauty', 'growing', 'Pheobe', 'thriving', 'care', 'adoptive', 'mother.While', 'movie', 'unrated', 'intended', 'older', 'teens', 'adults', 'are', 'sex', 'scenes', 'adulterous', 'relationships', 'are', 'part', 'story', 'acting', 'also', 'slightly', 'uneven', 'parts', 'Nevertheless', 'pro-life', 'message', 'movie', 'life', 'valuable', 'precious', 'one', 'worth', 'watching', 'Gill', 'fight', 'gain', 'educational', 'rights', 'daughter', 'also', 'inspiring', 'much', 'faith', 'determination', 'hard', 'help', 'daughter', 'become', 'can', 'be.The', 'Memory', 'Keeper', 'Daughter', 'will', 'foster', 'much', 'discussion', 'will', 'definitely', 'tug', 'heart', 'have', 'not', 'already', 'seen', 'read', 'book', 'highly', 'recommend', 'adding', 'to-be-watched', 'list']",The Memory Keeper's Daughter
