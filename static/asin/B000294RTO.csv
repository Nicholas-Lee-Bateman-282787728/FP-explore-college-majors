827496,A37PV5GMP2ILJC,B000294RTO,Amanda Richards,"[33, 35]","This is the latest Kipper DVD to be added to our collection.  It only has six stories, but they're really good ones.We didn't get the earlier VHS editions, so all the stories are new to my four year old, who thoroughly enjoys them.  As a matter of fact, my two year old nephew is now a convert.The beauty of the DVD edition is the feature which allows you to choose an episode, or play them all, or play them all continuously, the last being the favorite pick at our house.In ""The Visitor"", Kipper looks after a little lost gosling.  This is a good story if your kids are really messy, as Kipper is continuously cleaning up after his little charge.""Pig's Present"" tells of Pig's birthday and all the pets he receives as gifts.  The part with the hamster going through Kipper's ""obstacle course"" is great fun.""The Butterfly"" teaches that the best things in life should be free.""The Bleepers"" will have your kids speaking strangely, and eating lollipops.Arnold is formally introduced in ""Pig's Cousin"" - I had previously thought they were brothers.""The Little Ghost"" is the most entertaining story of the lot, with the most ""special effects"" of any Kipper episode.If you haven't already seen the early episodes, I strongly recommend this one.  If not, borrow it just for ""The Little Ghost""Amanda Richards, March 25, 2005",5,A fun six-pack,1111708800,"03 25, 2005",2005,1318,"['latest', 'Kipper', 'DVD', 'be', 'added', 'collection', 'only', 'six', 'stories', ""'re"", 'really', 'good', 'ones.We', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'earlier', 'VHS', 'editions', 'stories', 'are', 'new', 'four', 'year', 'old', 'who', 'thoroughly', 'matter', 'fact', 'two', 'year', 'old', 'nephew', 'now', 'convert.The', 'beauty', 'DVD', 'edition', 'feature', 'choose', 'episode', 'play', 'play', 'continuously', 'last', 'being', 'favorite', 'pick', 'house.In', 'Visitor', 'Kipper', 'little', 'lost', 'gosling', 'good', 'story', 'kids', 'are', 'really', 'messy', 'Kipper', 'continuously', 'cleaning', 'up', 'little', 'charge', 'Pig', 'Present', 'tells', 'Pig', 'birthday', 'pets', 'gifts', 'part', 'hamster', 'going', 'Kipper', 'obstacle', 'course', 'great', 'fun', 'Butterfly', 'best', 'things', 'life', 'should', 'be', 'free', 'Bleepers', 'will', 'have', 'kids', 'speaking', 'strangely', 'eating', 'lollipops.Arnold', 'formally', 'introduced', 'Pig', 'Cousin', 'had', 'previously', 'thought', 'were', 'brothers', 'Little', 'Ghost', 'most', 'entertaining', 'story', 'lot', 'most', 'special', 'effects', 'Kipper', 'episode.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'seen', 'early', 'episodes', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'one', 'not', 'borrow', 'just', 'Little', 'Ghost', 'Amanda', 'Richards', 'March', '25', '2005']",Kipper - Kipper He Out

They all are kind of laid back characters that are not loud and drive parents nuts. The more you see them the more you appreciate them, they are very easy to watch or listen to for parents, no screaming, no banging each other over the head, nothing objectionable.
