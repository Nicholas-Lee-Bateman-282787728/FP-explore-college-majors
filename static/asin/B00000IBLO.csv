Instead of being brats, the children all love her in time, which is a plot change which is refreshing. She shares funny moments with other governesses, who become her good friends - and they know when she's falling in love with the son of the owner. He's beautiful Vincent Perez, and it's ""love at first sight"" - but, of course, he's married, so it's hopeless. He unrealistically asks her to run away with him, and she sees the impossibility of the situation. It's formulaic, predictable, to the point that Vincent Perez dies as always in his movies. I would enjoy seeing one he lives through.

502245,A3HD7SVBY4JZOW,B00000IBLO,Donegal Dan,"[2, 2]","This is a lovely, inspiring and ultimately sad film.  It is not for the audience that has to have endless discussion and psychobabble about feelings, conflicts, etc. or action, action, action.  The story is set in Spain in the 1930's as the Fascists were gaining power and the Spanish Civil War was in the air.  Both the hero and the heroine are from a strong Catholic tradition that elevates family and adherence to the church's teachings (however flawed they may be).  The two actors involved not only have chemistry, but it is smoldering. However,  it is also quiet and restrained, as it would be in that setting and at that time.  Many things were happening that involved the family into which the young Irish tutor had come and they were monmentous events, involving the lives and wellbeing of all the members,as well as the fate of the country they love.  The father (Franco Nero) and the son(Vincent Perez) were both anti-Fascist and they were in more and more danger as the movie progressed. I found the love story to be moving and the portrayal of the torn feelings of the lovers and other family members to be sensitive and engrossing.  It was a terrible time of conflict in Spain and the young tutor had just left her homeland, Ireland, which had recently undergone a similar tragic upheaval.  I think this story is about things that mattered greatly at that time and place--conscience, patriotism, devotion and integrity.  It was beautifully filmed and acted and had a deeply moving message about the passions, needs, and duties that drive decent people in times of turbulence.",5,A Beautiful Film,1241740800,"05 8, 2009",2009,1589,"['lovely', 'inspiring', 'ultimately', 'sad', 'film', 'not', 'audience', 'have', 'endless', 'discussion', 'psychobabble', 'feelings', 'conflicts', 'etc', 'action', 'action', 'action', 'story', 'set', 'Spain', '1930', 'Fascists', 'were', 'gaining', 'power', 'Spanish', 'Civil', 'War', 'was', 'air', 'hero', 'heroine', 'are', 'strong', 'Catholic', 'tradition', 'family', 'adherence', 'church', 'teachings', 'however', 'flawed', 'may', 'be', 'two', 'actors', 'involved', 'not', 'only', 'have', 'chemistry', 'smoldering', 'However', 'also', 'quiet', 'restrained', 'would', 'be', 'setting', 'time', 'Many', 'things', 'were', 'happening', 'involved', 'family', 'young', 'Irish', 'tutor', 'had', 'come', 'were', 'monmentous', 'events', 'involving', 'lives', 'wellbeing', 'members', 'as', 'well', 'fate', 'country', 'love', 'father', 'Franco', 'Nero', 'son', 'Vincent', 'Perez', 'were', 'anti-Fascist', 'were', 'more', 'more', 'danger', 'movie', 'progressed', 'found', 'love', 'story', 'be', 'moving', 'portrayal', 'torn', 'feelings', 'lovers', 'other', 'family', 'members', 'be', 'sensitive', 'engrossing', 'was', 'terrible', 'time', 'conflict', 'Spain', 'young', 'tutor', 'had', 'just', 'left', 'homeland', 'Ireland', 'had', 'recently', 'undergone', 'similar', 'tragic', 'upheaval', 'think', 'story', 'things', 'mattered', 'greatly', 'time', 'place', 'conscience', 'patriotism', 'devotion', 'integrity', 'was', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'acted', 'had', 'deeply', 'moving', 'message', 'passions', 'needs', 'duties', 'drive', 'decent', 'people', 'times', 'turbulence']",Talk of Angels VHS
502246,A2TDUV7QTMFWFP,B00000IBLO,Elizabeth,"[34, 36]","This wonderfully acted tale takes place in the mist of the Fascist's rise to power in Spain.  The movie tells the story of an Irish nanny, how she contends with her peers and the family she works for.  She falls in love with the married son of the family--but while a theme in the movie, it is not the major one.  Instead, the movie focuses in on the family dynamic and how different members of the family contend with the social and political strife around them, told through the eyes (to use a cliche) of the nanny.Sadly, because this movie doesn't rely on nude scenes, things blowing up every five minutes are cursing every other word, few have heard of this movie.

502247,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00000IBLO,Grady Harp,"[42, 43]","TALK OF ANGELS is a beautifully photographed, well written, and sensitively acted story about how political upheavals alter our interpersonal relationships.  The time is 1936 and the place is Spain in the throws of Fascism and Franco.  A wealthy family (Marisa Paredes is the mother, Franco Nero the father with three daughters the eldest of whom is Penelope Cruz) in an unnamed Spanish city has just hired a governess from Ireland to teach their children proper English.  The governess, Lavelle, (Polly Walker) has taken the job to put distance between her Irish activist betrothed and herself, finding the need to explore the world before settling for what she has. In her new Spanish home Lavelle encounters other Irish expatriots who have fled Ireland's upheavals only to find those of Spain.  Among these eccentric women is one (Frances McDormand) who falls in love with Lavelle. The family for whom Lavelle works attempts to stay outside the political upheaval that fills the streets at night. All proceeds smoothly until the son Francisco (Vincent Perez) visits with his wife and family in tow.  Francisco supports the Spanish activists, and Lavelle slowly falls in love with him - the embodiment of the ideals of her own betrothed. Sides are drawn and defined in the political arena and in the personal arena, and it is the resolution of both that provides an open end to the story.The acting is first rate with Polly Walker incandescently beautiful and delivering a character role with great sensitivity.  Vincent Perez is her perfect foil and the rest of the fine cast draw unforgettable characters. There is much to be learned here about the political milieu in Spain in the 1930s.  And there is even more to experience in the beauty of the conversations, the dancing, the vistas of Spanish landscapes.  The musical score is lush and wisely orchestrated.  This is a little sleeper of a film that deserves repeated viewings to catch all the levels of meaning.
