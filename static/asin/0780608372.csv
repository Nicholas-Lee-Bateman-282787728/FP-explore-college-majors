It has quite a few laughs along with a pretty decent  (overall...aside from all the weed smoking) message to young ones.  Some of  the leading ladies were well cast.

Gary Gary does a 5-star caliber direction in this hilariously brilliant comedy.  ""Friday"" was a definate turn point in African-American comedy, who's brilliance like Richard Pryor's, could only match up to.  Ice cube, whom around the time ""Friday"" came out in theaters, was under pressure from the media and congress, about his ""supposive"" realtion in rap music to the 1992 LA riots, along with Ice-T and Chuck D of Public Enemy, plays a great job, much along with Chris Tucker and John Witherspoon.It's Friday morning, 8:00 am.  Craig Jones (Cube) wakes up to a loud banging noise from his front door.  He opens to find two Church ladies selling pamplets.  Craig immdiately slams the door shut...thus begins the day Craig will never forget...Friday.  Craig was recently fired from his job (which isn't said through out the film, but you can pretty much guess what it is) after being caught on a security camera, steeling boxer shorts.  Craig's father (played by the geniuslly funny, John Witherspoon) is a tweedy, Dog catche, who's main ideal in life is getting Craig out of the house or working as a dog catcher.  Craig's mother is a loving, yet somethingsself-conceious, workcholic mother, whom bakes an entire breakfast of eggs, sausage, bacon and hashbrowns...for herself.  Craig's sister is the average teen who's main course is shopping and chilling with her girlfriends.  After Mr. and Mrs. Jones leave, and sibling Jones takes off, Craig is left all by himself...or he wish he was.  Immediately after getting ready, Craig is bombarted by his pot-smoking and dealing friend, Smokey (Chris Tucker, in the role that made him famous).  Smokey runs into trouble,when his Drug-dealing boss,Big-Worm, comes rolling by and finds out that Smokey is not only 500-bucks short on selling weed that he grows in his house, but he's even got into smoking his own product.  Worm threatens Smokey that if he doesn't get the money by tonight, he AND Craig will both pay.  Craig, being reluctant on the fact his friend got he into a heap of trouble (and it isn't even 12:00 yet!), Craig desides to take drastic measures, involing a neighborhood bully named Deebo (Tom 'Tiny' Lister Jr.) stealing the money from a snotty next door neighboor. The plan falls through and Smokey and Craig have to find another way to get the money.  Anyways, the two get through the day by witnessing their neighboors live hilariously pathectic everyday lives.  At one point, the two gawk at a Hot neighboor named Mrs. Parker and her unknowing midget husband, constain joggers and an annoying kleptomaniactic fool named Ezal.  Also along the way are Mexican gangster, a punk paperboy and several cases of intoxication from...you know what.Friday never cease to stop making you laugh.  It's so well casted and written.  Every joke is laughable, no matter how lame is sounds.  The soundtrack is filled with nice Rap tunes, like Dr. Dre and...well, Ice Cube.  The original Kings of Comedy star Berne Mac makes a short cameo apperance as a sleazy reverend, who takes an ""vow"" on Mrs. Parker across the street.

Ice Cube did a good job portraying Craig Jones, and of course, Chris Tucker was HILARIOUS as Craig's best friend Smokey. In fact, people were still repeating Smokey's lines years after the movie came out, like: ""When you gonna let me F, Ms. Parker?"" or ""And you know this...MAN!"" or everyone's favorite: ""You got knocked the F out!"" (That even made me laugh when I wrote it.) It was also good to enjoy John Witherspoon as Craig's father, especially because that was before he became overexposed by being thrown into practically every bad Black movie (Soul Plane, anyone?).I only gave this four stars because of two things: 1) although the movie is funny, there really isn't much of a plot, and 2) now that I think about it, the scene with Mr. Jones in the bathroom WAS kind of disgusting. But Friday is still a great movie, and it's a lot better than either of the sequels -- and it doesn't help that most of the main characters from this movie aren't even in the other movies (Mike Epps is funny, but let's face it; he's no Chris Tucker).

I must say that I was slightly skeptical about how much I'd enjoy this movie but it turned out to be far better than expected. It is a mix of humor and drama wherein the humor outweighs everything else. Friday is very unique as the characters stand above the generic ones Hollywood usually offers. Ice Cube is great and plays a straight man to Chris Tucker's Smokey. The best parts of the film are when Tucker speaks. He has hilarious line after another. The one thing I had to disagree with, as far as the descriptions of this movie go, is that it is devoid of any moral element. This isn't a typical stoner celebration of weed because only after Ice Cube smokes the smoke does everything really fall apart for him. He nearly ruins his chance with a girl he really likes and then...well, I won't give any of the plot away.

27740,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,0780608372,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[2, 2]","One of the surprise comedies of 1995, Friday features the antics of two guys in Los Angeles who decide to spend a day hanging out on their porch and wasting away the day. With a well-selected cast, the characters in Friday are some of the most eccentric and outrageous persons that can be found in any movie. A lot can happen in the neighborhood on any given day, and best friends Craig and Smokey get to see it all. And along the way, they learn a few lessons about life...When Craig Jones (Ice Cube) gets fired from his job, his dogcatcher father (John Witherspoon) pressures him to spend the day looking for a new job - ""The word of the day, Craig is job - J-O-B. Job!"" But Craig doesn't feel like looking for a job just yet, and when his best friend Smokey (Chris Tucker) pays a visit to the house, a day of doing nothing becomes an absolute certainty. With both his parents away at work, Craig and Smokey hang out on the front porch of the Jones house where they observe the strange behavior of the various eccentric characters who live in their neighborhood.Encouraging Craig to try some weed for the first time, Smokey involves Craig in a personal dispute with local drug dealer Big Worm (Faizon Love) who accuses Smokey (one of his dealers) of smoking up his product. Smokey denies the allegation and agrees to pay Big Worm $200 later that night. Big Worm says if he doesn't get his money by then, he'll kill Smokey and Craig...When Craig finds out what happened, he's furious. As he and Smokey attempt to figure out a way to get the $200, they get sidetracked by a number of different people. Among them are Deebo (Tom 'Tiny' Lister), the neighborhood bully who no one will challenge, Mrs. Parker (Kathleen Bradley), the exhibitionist neighbor who Craig and Smokey fantasize about, Felisha (Angela Means), a drug-addicted neighbor with no job, Ezal (Anthony Johnson), the neighborhood crack addict, and an assorted barrage of other characters and Janet Jackson look-alikes...When Craig's current girlfriend gets angry because he talks to another woman, he pursues Debbie (Nia Long), a much more desirable girl in his mother's eyes. But as the end of the evening nears, Big Worm sends his minions after Craig and Smokey, and Craig ends up in a personal showdown with Deebo. Will Craig use a gun to get rid of Deebo, or will he fight it out like a man?A hilarious comedy, Friday is a non-stop series of laughs. Chris Tucker's overpowering screen presence literally makes this film. Without him, Friday would be little more than a humdrum bore. In fact, if one were to read the script alone, it's extremely doubtful that any director or producer would bite. But when Tucker reads the lines, they take on a life of their own. Tucker is just plain funny - a hilarious comic who can draw an audience with his personality alone. Also of note - don't watch Friday on basic cable or any other medium that will water down the dialogue and edit it down to nothing. One can't experience the true film unless it's watched uncut. Otherwise, it's not funny at all, with or without Chris Tucker. Overall, this is a unique and different film. A comedy with its own personal identity. And for that reason, Friday is a must-see film.

However, that wasn't the only problem that await him on a Friday that changed his life and was almost his last day living.

""Friday"" is hardly considered a thinking man's masterpiece, though it does incorporate a strong anti-guns message (perhaps, to make up for its pro-marijuna one) in the end. What is great about ""Friday"" is that it's not afraid to have fun, no matter how silly its gags get. It uses a whole bunch of great comedic character actors, such as John Witherspoon as Cube's pops and A.J. Johnson as the neighborhood crackhead.The story of Friday has Craig (Cube) recently fired from his job as he decides to spend a care-free Friday with his best bud, Smokey (Tucker). Smokey decides to smoke his buddy up to celebrate the weekend. Turns out that joint they smoke together was from weed that Smokey was supposed to sell. This is a big problem when the local drug dealer, Big Worm, who is also the neighborhood ice cream man, shows up and demands his cut. When Smokey can't come up with the money, Worm offers him an altermatium- either have the money by midnight or Smokey and Craig are dead. The remainder of the film has the two trying to come up with wacky ideas on how to get the money while trying to avoid the neighborhood bully, Deebo (Lister) and Craig's psychotic girlfriend.New Line's ""Friday"" DVD is nearly flawless.

Also Craig was 10 times more likeable and believeable in this one than in the other ones.  What happened to the pairing of Debbie (Nia Long) and Craig they were supposed to hook up at the end of this one, but they acted like she never existed in the other movies.

The script by Ice Cube and DJ Pooh is right on target with it's ghetto humor. Another plus point for the film is it doesn't stereotype. But it's Chris Tucker as Smokey who makes this film. His high pitched voice and mannerisms are classic.Hard-core rapper Ice Cube, after appearing in such hard-hitting films as Boyz 'N the Hood and Higher Learning, played his first comic role in this picture he co-wrote with frequent musical collaborator DJ Pooh. Craig (Ice Cube) manages to get fired on his day off (though he claims it's through no fault of his own) and spends the day hanging out with his buddy Smokey (Chris Tucker) and trying to avoid his father (John Witherspoon), who wants him to find another job immediately. Smokey (whose name might have something to do with his tremendous fondness for marijuana) has even more serious problems; he was given $200 worth of weed to sell by Big Worm (Faizon Love), but he ended up smoking it instead, and if he can't come up with the money by the end of the day, he'll be in a world of hurt (and will put Craig in the same place just for being his friend). And Deebo (Tom ""Tiny"" Lister, Jr.), a gargantuan bully who roams the neighborhood on his bicycle, has it in for Craig, while Craig tries his best just to stay out of his way.

My favorite parts however are when REd gets knocked out by Deebo and the father gets out the car.&quot;YOu want some of this too old man huh!&quot;&quot;NO!!!!!!!get yo a$$ up boy and get in this car, I told you bout messing around with these people!&quot;My other favorite part is when Craig is high and he's talking to Debbie on the couch, and he turns and sees little puppie dogs staring at him and he goes &quot;What the FHFG! man i'm trippin&quot;Another part when it's getting dark and Smokey and craig are trying to come up with a plan and Smokey says:&quot;Alright here's what we gon do, I'ma give you the gun, then I'ma go to my house and chill, you sit here on the porch and wait for dem niccas and later on you call me and tell me what happened!&quot;THis movie is funny from beginning (Jehovah's Witnesses and No Milk) to end (&quot;I don't wanna die...Hey craig I love you man&quot;) and is very memorable.

From the front porch, we see the everyday of their neighborhood through their eyes.  The movie is funny, with a few serious themes covered.There are more than a couple of themes covered in the movie.  Probably the two most important are drug use (mostly marijuana) and violence.  The smoking is not really frowned upon in the movie.  What is frowned upon is the escalation of violence, which seems to be directly linked to the smoking.Smokey sells for ""Big Worm,"" by smokes most of the product rather than selling it.  As a result, Smokey has put his life in danger.  Craig, now linked to his friend, is succumbing to the pressure and has a firearm.  There is a serious, yet slightly comedic, talk from his father explaining that using the gun is cowardice.  A man would use his fists, and a man will not be afraid to take a beating.This is a funny movie.

A plot doesn't exist in this comedy, nor is this a character-driven vehicle, but it's a wild ride from start to finish without much of a high budget.""Friday"" is an urban comedy that depicts a single day in the life of Craig (Ice Cube), who has just been fired on his day off. Craig's off day consists of interactions with various characters in the neighborhood. They include his cantankerous dad (John Witherspoon); his lovable mother (Anna Maria Horsford); his sister Dana (Regina King); his spoilt girlfriend Joi (Paula Jai Parker); his love interest (Nia Long); Deebo (Tiny ""Zeus"" Lister Jr.) the hulking neighborhood bully; Big Worm (Faizon Love) the neighborhood gangster; and his token friend Smokey (Chris Tucker).There's not a lot that can be said about the acting and most of the help comes from the supporting characters. Such as, Chris Tucker who steals the show with his landmark role as ultra-pothead Smokey. Tucker has that unrelenting comic energy that only a comedian of supreme talent can possess. Even when the film falls flat, he picks you back up. I also have to commend John Witherspoon, as Ice Cube's father. I loved him on ""The Wayans Bros."" and I loved him in this movie. Though I was laughing most of the time, the gags are indeed crude--very crude. And sometimes that crudeness just wears out. Luckily, it's not too often, and there are some memorable lines and memorable moments in ""Friday.""I feel as though this is one of the better movies about the hood. It' really more than just a comedy instead it puts forth a deeper meaning in life. It is about facing one's fears and becoming a man. In one scene, the father sees Craig with a gun and tells him that holding a gun won't make him man; it's having the courage to fight with his fists that will. Now, I know this doesn't sound like the greatest thing for a parent to be telling his kid, but in the projects fighting with one's hands instead of picking up a gun is courageous. This movie is great to own as well as the Ice Cube-based sound track.",4,"""Can I borrow y'all VCR?

Friday is one of those films that you can watch once and remember every scene in the movie.  It's a simple black comedy without all the stereotype B.S. The main character, Craig Jones ( Ice Cube ) isn't some ignorant gang banger that sells drugs.  He's your average hardworking twenty-something who's falling down on his luck by losing his job.  What I mostly love about Friday is that it stays away from the cliches.  Craig's parents ( Anna-Maria Horsford and John Witherspoon ) are upstanding, middle-class people with good jobs who've raised responsible children.  Dana, Craig's sister ( played by the lovely Regina King ) is not a hoochie or tramp, but a regular high school student minding her own business.  No one is ignorant in this film, not even Smokey ( Chris Tucker ). Chris easily stole the show from Cube and it seemed terribly easy to do.  Without Smokey this film wouldn't have survived my fast forward button but Chris keeps the action going.  He is in almost every scene and you'll be laughing out your seat because of this.Friday is not a ' hood ' movie. It's a film about two friends( who happen to be black and one who happens to smoke weed ) hanging out.  This scenerio happens everywhere no matter what race or kind of neighborhood you come from. I like to think of Friday as a buddy film.  Friday is a treat if you know what you're looking at. If you're expecting to see Menace II Society meets Boyz in the Hood you will be disappointed.  Friday is a comedy, plain and simple! The laughs out rank the violence refreshingly. It's just a film anyone can relate to no matter what race, age, gender or status.

Ice Cube was brilliant as Craig, Chris Tucker stole the show as Smokey, and Tiny Lister became America's favorite bully (and in some places, his name is slang for bully now) as Deebo.  And the rest of the lineup was perfect too.  You had John Witherspoon (Mr. Jones), Bernie Mac (The Reverend), Faizon Love (Big Perm, I mean, Big Worm), and who could forget the hilarious A.J. Johnson (Ezell)?  You can sift through the entire movie and find one liners and dialogue that people STILL use today.  You can't say that about the other two movies.

27824,ABE14SVILZLNY,0780608372,"SID ""Punk""","[0, 2]","It seems like most movies take place over a period of no more than a few days, but a movie set to less than 24 hours might seem like a stretch. With ""Friday"" you get a movie dealing with subjects like drive-by shootings and domestic violence, and though all this is clumped in one day it still remained light enough to laugh with.Ice Cube stars as Craig a young man who was fired the day before from his job. With nothing to do he and friend Smokey (Chris Tucker) hang out, but Smokey owes local drug dealer Big Worm (Faizon Love) two hundred dollars. The two try to raise the money but find that more difficult than it should be.First, I should say that my plot description doesn't make ""Friday"" sound like much. The thing is that the movie is basically about the two main characters hanging out, and yet the story written by Ice Cube and hip-hop producer DJ Pooh (Who also stars as Red) is able to keep the film moving nicely. What's really impressive is that the two characters didn't go out to create the stories action, instead they sat back and waited for things to happen. Though some of these events were fairly serious often they were handled with enough enjoyable humor that it's hard not to laugh.As a rapper Ice Cube has shown that he has a lot of charisma, and that came through in his Craig character. Here was a character that started off weak in the way he was written, but once he hit his front porch became very likeable. It was Chris Tucker that stole the show though. You want to talk about charisma watch him do simple things like try to stop his car from rolling, or disagree with the local pastor, or even just squat to go to the bathroom. Where the script might have come off as very immature doing these things, because of Tucker's comic talent these were hilarious to watch.""Friday"" was definitely not a perfect movie. A lot of the gags weren't funny, and the characters were annoying at times. Also, it did seem to drag at times proving a few minutes should have been cut.

What I saw was one of the funniest works of film that I had ever seen (even to this day).  Basically, it follows the adventures of Craig and Smokey on a Friday, and what ensues is hilarious:  Craig gets fired on his day off; they get harassed by the neighborhood bully; Smokey tries to outwit a drug dealer; they whoop a young punk who enjoys knocking over trash cans; Smokey gets set up on a blind date; and Craig keeps getting told to put some water on his cereal after he runs out of milk.
