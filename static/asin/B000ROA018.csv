1083290,A3P867ODHBLJ3U,B000ROA018,Harry Young,"[0, 0]","The Miami Dolphin teams featured in these DVDs are historic since they were firsts to win championship by perfect season 17-0, and their second championship provided feat of first to appear in Superbowl 3 years in a row. Winning 2 out of 3 Superbowls was a great accomplishment. Like all of America's Game DVDs, it showcases whole season not just Superbowl highlights. And the player narratives are great, since they all felt part of something special, like part of history, and these DVDs showcase those historic seasons. Also includes funny stories, inside stories that I assume only players knew and they're telling them to veiwers.",5,Perfect Season 17-0,1293148800,"12 24, 2010",2010,635,"['Miami', 'Dolphin', 'teams', 'featured', 'DVDs', 'are', 'historic', 'were', 'firsts', 'win', 'championship', 'perfect', 'season', '17-0', 'second', 'championship', 'provided', 'feat', 'first', 'appear', 'Superbowl', '3', 'years', 'row', 'Winning', '2', '3', 'Superbowls', 'was', 'great', 'accomplishment', 'America', 'Game', 'DVDs', 'whole', 'season', 'not', 'just', 'Superbowl', 'highlights', 'player', 'narratives', 'are', 'great', 'felt', 'part', 'something', 'special', 'part', 'history', 'DVDs', 'showcase', 'historic', 'seasons', 'Also', 'funny', 'stories', 'stories', 'assume', 'only', 'players', 'knew', ""'re"", 'telling', 'veiwers']",Dolphins Team Marketing NFL Game: Dolphins

In recent years, I had been trying to get a good  comprehensive history of the 'Perfect Season' in particular, but found it quite difficult to acquire. I then stumbled upon this 2 DVD set and I can tell you that this set is worth every penny of what I paid for it and more. The color and sound quality are fantastic and I know that you will be pleased as well. There is archival footage galore and plenty of great football action here, plus interviews from back then and more recent ones. The players interviewed in this set are  Larry Csonka, Manny Fernandez, Mercury Morris, Dick Anderson, Bob Keuchenberg and of course the ""Shu"" himself Don Shula.
