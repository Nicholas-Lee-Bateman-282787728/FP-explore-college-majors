755231,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B00009MGER,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[1, 2]","This anime DVD has received rave reviews since its release back in 2003 and having heard so much about this anime and its manga series, I figured that I'll give a try since you can literally pick this title up for around $5 online (or $15 for the Ultimate Collection which includes the three manga graphic novels).The storyline focuses on three girls:Otani Yuri - Yuri is a sixth grader and the eldest of the three and somewhat the main character of this OAV series. She was elected by her classmates to be the representative for the Alien Party (their duty is to capture aliens that land in their school yard). Yuri is a fearful girl, always scared, very shy and cries nearly about everything.Kawamura Kumi - A sixth grader and is the tallest member of the group, member of the student council and independent. Since her father has passed away, she has lived life as a mature young girl, assisting her mother in work duties, chores and very disciplined.Tomine Kasumi - A sixth grader that is multi-talented. She excels in everything she does and has trophies and awards for her accomplishments. She is the shortest member and when she talks, her vocabulary is like a young girl and answers with a neko-style ""nya"".These three sixth graders make up the Alien Party under the tutelage of Hisakawa Megumi, their advisor and councellor.Being a member of the Alien Party may seem exciting. If there is an alien that has landed in school, you don't have to attend classes and you are somewhat popular among your classmates for the work that you do. But for Yuri, she didn't want to do this.She hates the aliens, she hates conflict, she hates having to be an active person and she hates that she has to bond with a borg.A borg is symbiotic life form that bonds with their host. They are worn on the heads of an Alien Party member and provide the offense and defense for them. In return for what they do for the Alien Party members, they request to feed off the waste (typically licking the backs of sweat or whatever on the girls).The first four episodes are more about friendship and how these three young girls get along, especially since they are quite different from each other.I actually enjoyed the series but I admit that my patience was wearing thin in regards to the character of Otani Yuri.For me, I do no like characters that continually cry and whine (a side note: It's one of the reasons why in the past, I have not finished ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" because of the whining of character Shinji) and I have found the character of Otani Yuri to be just that.It's one thing if they become a whiny underdog and then proves everyone wrong as the character matures but for Otani, it was becoming a drag to hear her cry so much throughout this OAV series at almost everything that happens to her. But if there was one positive of the OAV series being only four episodes long, that is the viewer is not subject to whining and crying for a long period of time.Each time she's scared or yelled at, she cries. And these are not few or small segments, she does it too much! Yes, I'm sure that is how her character is and how it was probably show in the manga but there is only so much crying that can be done and since her character is a primary character in this OAV series, you would hope that she grows from it.I kept asking myself, what if she was put in the situation where she needs to save someones life. Would she cower in fear or save their life and in episode 4, she is put into that predicament.So, the over abundance of crying scenes by Otani's character was starting to wear thin for me but I'm sure other viewers took it in stride and have more patience than I do.Episode 4 is a bit more darker and definitely opened things up for something exciting to happen between the members of the Alien Party in future episodes and that is where another problem that I had with the series begins.There are no future episodes. There are no plans for a TV series or OAV series since the release of the four episode OAV back in 2001.For an anime and manga series that was well-liked in Japan, you can only hope that an animated version would continue.But similar to a series like ""Submarine 707-R"", I dislike watching a series that you really get into and enjoy but knowing that there are no further episodes left to watch, that kind of sucks!There is a one volume manga series titled ""Alien Nine Emulators"" released by Central Park Media which follows the three Alien Party members as they enter Junior High and having to adjust to puberty and emotions. Also, ""emulators"" is supposed to be much darker and more violent and there are other manga that have been released in Japan but that is if you are willing to import it.But as for the DVD and OAV series, ""ALIEN NINE"" was a series that I did enjoy. Yes, it's a cutesy anime but it is quite unique in its own way. The anime features way too much crying that nearly wanted to make me yank my hair out but all in all, it got very interesting as the storyline progressed and I actually wanted to see more.Now, there is an ultimate version of this DVD release available that comes with the manga graphic novels.  I've been told by many that the manga and anime versions are quite different and where the anime focuses on friendships, there is more than friendship going on in the manga series.Needless to say, after watching this regular edition, I now regret not picking up the ultimate edition because at least maybe there would be some areas that would fill in some plot holes and at least show me this other side in the manga series not explored in the animated OAV series.But all in all, both DVD versions can be found quite cheap online (and that's new not used).  Plus it's full of special features, so for its current price online, it's an OAV series definitely worth checking out.",4,A cute anime OAV series that will either make you cringe from all the crying or capture your attention and make you want more!,1218153600,"08 8, 2008",2008,5833,"['anime', 'DVD', 'received', 'rave', 'reviews', 'release', 'back', '2003', 'having', 'heard', 'so', 'much',

755232,A22OD81Z9HYFV1,B00009MGER,Kris,"[0, 0]","What happens when you mix children with their own companion alien, like Digimon and then you mix the disturbing psychology of Evangelion? The answer is this show, of course. First off, this is an unfinished anime and has only 4 episodes. There has not been any new episodes in nearly 10 years, so do not expect anything more from this series unless you read the manga, which is also unfinished.The art style of this anime looks similar to Azumanga Daioh, but the characters have really big ears and never seem to have noses on screen. The anime starts off rather pedestrian with three young girls who fight aliens with their own symbiotic aliens. Where did these aliens come from and why must they fight? The answers are never truly explained, so just go along with it. The anime would be alright with this premise, but the so-called main character cries a lot, and I mean a lot. She is like that because she seems to be afraid of everything that happens around, and she is definitely afraid of the aliens which makes her unable to fight on her own.The show becomes very strange and brutally violent by episode 2. Episode 4 is very psychological, and it is evident that it borrowed ideas from the later episodes of Evangelion. This show ends in a cliffhanger, and the viewer is just uncertain how to accept this show. It is an interesting show, but the ends do not justify the means. Anime like Lain and Boogiepop Phantom are more exceptional than this title.The DVD is distributed by Central Park Media (CPM) and there are no problems with the display of the DVD or the case. Its a standard CPM release, even with DVD extras like a talk with the English creative team, as well as the Japanese director. In conclusion, check this title out if you like deceptively cute anime that have dark elements to them (like Blood C.) However, do not buy this anime for children at all, regardless what you may see on the DVD case.",4,Pschological and disturbing,1380758400,"10 3, 2013",2013,1919,"['What', 'when', 'mix', 'children', 'own', 'companion', 'alien', 'Digimon', 'then', 'mix', 'disturbing', 'psychology', 'Evangelion', 'answer', 'show', 'course', 'First', 'off', 'unfinished', 'anime', 'only', '4', 'episodes', 'not', 'been', 'new', 'episodes', 'nearly', '10', 'years', 'so', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'anything', 'more', 'series', 'read', 'manga', 'also', 'unfinished.The', 'art', 'style', 'anime', 'similar', 'Azumanga', 'Daioh', 'characters', 'have', 'really', 'big', 'ears', 'never', 'seem', 'have', 'noses', 'screen', 'anime', 'rather', 'pedestrian', 'three', 'young', 'girls', 'who', 'fight', 'aliens', 'own', 'symbiotic', 'aliens', 'Where', 'did', 'aliens', 'come', 'why', 'must', 'fight', 'answers', 'are', 'never', 'truly', 'explained', 'so', 'just', 'go', 'along', 'anime', 'would', 'be', 'alright', 'premise', 'so-called', 'main', 'character', 'lot', 'mean', 'lot', 'be', 'afraid', 'everything', 'around', 'definitely', 'afraid', 'aliens', 'unable', 'fight', 'own.The', 'show', 'very', 'strange', 'brutally', 'violent', 'episode', '2', 'Episode', '4', 'very', 'psychological', 'evident', 'borrowed', 'ideas', 'later', 'episodes', 'Evangelion', 'show', 'cliffhanger', 'viewer', 'just', 'uncertain', 'how', 'accept', 'show', 'interesting', 'show', 'ends', 'do', 'not', 'justify', 'means', 'Anime', 'Lain', 'Boogiepop', 'Phantom', 'are', 'more', 'exceptional', 'title.The', 'DVD', 'distributed', 'Central', 'Park', 'Media', 'CPM', 'are', 'problems', 'display', 'DVD', 'case', 'standard', 'CPM', 'release', 'even', 'DVD', 'extras', 'talk', 'English', 'creative', 'team', 'as', 'well', 'Japanese', 'director', 'conclusion', 'check', 'title', 'out', 'like', 'deceptively', 'cute', 'anime', 'have', 'dark', 'elements', 'Blood', 'C.', 'However', 'do', 'not', 'buy', 'anime', 'children', 'regardless', 'what', 'may', 'see', 'DVD', 'case']",N/A
755233,A27FPQIWI6VAI9,B00009MGER,Martin Prehn,"[2, 2]","If you're interested in this anime because you like animation or you find the drawing on the cover appealing let me warn you: This is based on a manga, that as of yet is not completed. That means that the first three episodes here introduce our heroines and sort of gets the ball rolling as it were and then all of a sudden BAM! It ends after episode four. Only it doesn't really end. You see, one of the characters apparantly gets sucked into a giant whale like alien, and something really weird happens, and I'm not sure, but I think one of the main characters was seen lying dead in a pool of her own blood in the end?! Meanwhile a weird plot is slowly unfurling in the background about some alien stuff and their trainer seems to be involved somehow... Clearly as you can see, not a lot of answers are given at this early stage, yet it must be noted that the series is very well drawn, the animation is of a very high quality and provided there's more episodes coming in the future, I certainly plan to stick around. Also there are plenty of special features on the disc so you do get your money's worth.Originally I was gonna give this 3 stars only but I just can't do it. Anyone who comes up with the idea of putting frog-like aliens on the heads of three 6th graders and then have them rollerscating around after weird vegetablelike aliens with nets and dart guns deserves 4 stars for originality.

755234,A2O6KLIFWEKL51,B00009MGER,P. Krug,"[3, 5]","The story takes place in the not-too-distant-future. (Actually for a while I often wondered if the story was really supposed to take place on earth and if the characters were really supposed to be human, based solely on the fact that none of them appear to have a nose.) Aliens have made contact with us (we never do see how this first happened,) and now they frequently make trouble for people. They don't appear to have technology, (except maybe for the organic-looking ships they arrive in,) but are more animal-like. How do the athorities combat them? By sending in conventional military forces? No, silly. This is anime. Kids are the ones sent to do battle with these hostile invaders-in this case, a trio of 6 grade girls. (This brings me to a problem I've had with a lot of action anime shows made recently, where there is some terrible threat to the world and Japan and/or America responds by sending kids under 18 to deal with it. Look at FULL METAL PANIC! Souskae is only 17, yet not only is he in the military and going on life-or-death missions, he is a seargent. I'm I the only 1 who has a problem with that?)The youth of the world's saviors, the lack of an origin story showing how the aliens first got here (as well as the apparent lack of noses) are some of the problems I have with this video. Now comes my biggest complaint: the heroine, Yuri, is quite possibly the whinest crybaby ever to star in an anime show. This girl actually makes the title character from SAILOR MOON look like a badass by compairison. Even in her wimpiest moments, Serina/Usagi looks like Ellen Ripley next to Yuri. Also, Sailor Moon grows as a character and in the ends is much braver and stronger than she was at the beginning. Yuri spends all her time whenever she's engaged in battle standing around crying and talking about how scared she is and relying on her living alien helmet (all 3 girls have 1,) to do all the work for her, and she's every bit as wimpy at the end of the show as she was at the beginning. Admittedly, she is at a very tender age to be confronting enemies, and she was drafted into it. Also, 4 episodes dosen't allow much room for development. (There is a manga, though, that runs longer than the anime. I haven't read it, however.) Still and all, if Yuri dosen't develop some backbone QUICKLY, I don't know that I'd be that interested in reading it anyway. She was so grating I kept hoping 1 of the other girls would get fed up and slap her and then tell her to buck up already.On the plus side, this DVD has a nice extra with a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the dub. I always enjoy getting to see the people working behind the scenes and hearing their thoughts on their work.Oh, yeah, 1 more drawback. Another girl in the show, Kasumi, often mews like a cat for no apparent reason. (Again, she isn't the only anime character who dose this; there was a girl in I MY ME STRAWBERRIE EGGS who was the same way.) Is this just an anime thing or are there really girls in Japan who like to do this? I don't know if this is supposed to be cute or funny or whatever, but try to imagine a girl in America doing this and the kind of strange looks she'd get.",3,Possibly the whiniest heroine in the history of anime,1076284800,"02 9, 2004",2004,3178,"['story', 'place', 'not-too-distant-future', 'Actually', 'while', 'often', 'wondered', 'story', 'was', 'really', 'supposed', 'take', 'place', 'earth', 'characters', 'were', 'really', 'supposed', 'be', 'human', 'based', 'solely', 'fact', 'none', 'appear', 'have', 'nose', 'Aliens', 'have', 'made', 'contact', 'never', 'do', 'see', 'how', 'first', 'happened', 'now', 'frequently', 'make', 'trouble', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'appear', 'have', 'technology', 'maybe', 'organic-looking', 'ships', 'arrive', 'are', 'more', 'animal-like', 'How', 'do', 'athorities', 'combat', 'sending', 'conventional', 'military', 'forces', 'No', 'silly', 'anime', 'Kids', 'are', 'ones', 'sent', 'do', 'battle', 'hostile', 'invaders-in', 'case', 'trio', '6', 'grade', 'girls', 'problem', ""'ve"", 'had', 'lot', 'action', 'anime', 'shows', 'made', 'recently', 'where', 'terrible', 'threat', 'world', 'Japan', 'and/or', 'America', 'responds', 'sending', 'kids', '18', 'deal', 'Look', 'FULL', 'METAL', 'PANIC', 'Souskae', 'only', '17', 'yet', 'not', 'only', 'military', 'going', 'life-or-death', 'missions', 'seargent', ""'m"", 'only', '1', 'who', 'problem', 'youth', 'world', 'saviors', 'lack', 'origin', 'story', 'showing', 'how', 'aliens', 'first', 'got', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'apparent', 'lack', 'noses', 'are', 'problems', 'have', 'video', 'Now', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'heroine', 'Yuri', 'quite', 'possibly', 'whinest', 'crybaby', 'ever', 'star', 'anime', 'show', 'girl', 'actually', 'title', 'character', 'SAILOR', 'MOON', 'look', 'badass', 'compairison', 'Even', 'wimpiest', 'moments', 'Serina/Usagi', 'Ellen', 'Ripley', 'next', 'Yuri', 'Also', 'Sailor', 'Moon', 'character', 'ends', 'much', 'braver', 'stronger', 'was', 'beginning', 'Yuri', 'time', 'whenever', 'engaged', 'battle', 'standing', 'crying', 'talking', 'how', 'scared', 'relying', 'living', 'alien', 'helmet', '3', 'girls', 'have', '1', 'do', 'work', 'bit', 'wimpy', 'end', 'show', 'was', 'beginning', 'Admittedly', 'very', 'tender', 'age', 'be', 'confronting', 'enemies', 'was', 'drafted', 'Also', '4', 'episodes', 'dose', ""n't"", 'allow', 'much', 'room', 'development', 'manga', 'though', 'longer', 'anime', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'however', 'Still', 'Yuri', 'dose', ""n't"", 'develop', 'backbone', 'QUICKLY', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'d"", 'be', 'interested', 'reading', 'anyway', 'was', 'so', 'grating', 'kept', 'hoping', '1', 'other', 'girls', 'would', 'get', 'fed', 'up', 'slap', 'then', 'tell', 'buck', 'up', 'plus', 'side', 'DVD', 'nice', 'extra', 'behind-the-scenes', 'look', 'making', 'dub', 'always', 'enjoy', 'getting', 'see', 'people', 'working', 'scenes', 'hearing', 'thoughts', 'work.Oh', 'yeah', '1', 'more', 'drawback', 'girl', 'show', 'Kasumi', 'often', 'cat', 'apparent', 'reason', 'Again', ""n't"", 'only', 'anime', 'character', 'who', 'dose', 'was', 'girl', 'MY', 'ME', 'STRAWBERRIE', 'EGGS', 'who', 'was', 'same', 'way', 'just', 'anime', 'thing', 'are', 'really', 'girls', 'Japan', 'who', 'like', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'supposed', 'be', 'cute', 'funny', 'whatever', 'try', 'imagine', 'girl', 'America', 'doing', 'kind', 'strange', 'looks', ""'d"", 'get']",N/A

755238,A3GSWTW4PGL2XC,B00009MGER,Timothy Perper,"[8, 10]","A group of girls saving the world from aliens and other yucksome thingies -- wonderful stuff, such stories: Sailor Moon, Tokyo Mew Mew, Shadow Lady. And aliens, some of them distinctly yucksome, abound in Alien Nine, together with three 6th grade heroines named Kumi, Kusumi, and Yuri. Rollerblading around the school with lacrosse rackets and wearing their borg helmets - a type of symbiotic alien who protects them with what look like long, thin, and very dangerous wriggly drill bits - the girls catch aliens who otherwise would do yucksome things to everybody. The only tiniest problem is that Yuri is scared, just plain terrified. --- In Alien Nine, we see beneath the cheerful superheroine antics of chasing aliens. Kusumi is a lonely overachiever, Kumi a lonely leader of her schoolmates, and Yuri is just lonely. Depressed and sad, Yuri wants nothing to do with deadly aliens nor the lunatic boys who use their own borgs to attack her nor crazed teachers who seem to have set up these alien-chasing games as an arcane test of things unsaid and unstated. --- And so we encounter not yucksome alien thingies from spaceships, but the alienness of what is within, the fear of growing up into a (sexual) adult, the terror of losing oneself in the all-engulfing needs of another person, the lethal dread of being abandoned. --- So why watch Alien Nine? Because Yuri hasn't given up yet. Lonely, terrified, she rollerblades onward, crying, having nightmares, unable to aim her dart gun, and, in one genuinely stunning scene that's worth the price of the whole DVD, turning and killing her attackers. --- Alien Nine is not about aliens, yucksome or otherwise. It's a superb exploration of what alienation truly means: of being a child and having to grow up because your body is changing out from under you. The aliens - and this holds for the manga as well - are a metaphor for becoming someone else. Not everyone makes it, either. Unfortunately, the DVD is unfinished, and we do not find out what happens at the end. Maybe that's part of the message: we don't know, not really, how life will turn out. But (in the meantime) Alien Nine is well worth watching: haunting, grim, powerful, and ultimately completely convincing.",5,"Haunting, Powerful, and Unfinished",1087430400,"06 17, 2004",2004,2223,"['group', 'girls', 'saving', 'world', 'aliens', 'other', 'yucksome', 'thingies', 'wonderful', 'stuff', 'such', 'stories', 'Sailor', 'Moon', 'Tokyo', 'Mew', 'Mew', 'Shadow', 'Lady', 'aliens', 'distinctly', 'yucksome', 'abound', 'Alien', 'Nine', 'together', 'three', '6th', 'grade', 'heroines', 'named', 'Kumi', 'Kusumi', 'Yuri', 'Rollerblading', 'school', 'lacrosse', 'rackets', 'wearing', 'borg', 'helmets', 'type', 'symbiotic', 'alien', 'who', 'what', 'look', 'long', 'thin', 'very', 'dangerous', 'wriggly', 'drill', 'bits', 'girls', 'catch', 'aliens', 'who', 'otherwise', 'would', 'do', 'yucksome', 'things', 'everybody', 'only', 'tiniest', 'problem', 'Yuri', 'scared', 'just', 'plain', 'terrified', 'Alien', 'Nine', 'see', 'cheerful', 'superheroine', 'antics', 'chasing', 'aliens', 'Kusumi', 'lonely', 'overachiever', 'Kumi', 'lonely', 'leader', 'schoolmates', 'Yuri', 'just', 'lonely', 'Depressed', 'sad', 'Yuri', 'nothing', 'do', 'deadly', 'aliens', 'lunatic', 'boys', 'who', 'use', 'own', 'borgs', 'attack', 'crazed', 'teachers', 'who', 'seem', 'have', 'set', 'up', 'alien-chasing', 'games', 'arcane', 'test', 'things', 'unsaid', 'unstated', 'encounter', 'not', 'yucksome', 'alien', 'thingies', 'spaceships', 'alienness', 'what', 'fear', 'growing', 'up', 'sexual', 'adult', 'terror', 'losing', 'all-engulfing', 'needs', 'person', 'lethal', 'dread', 'being', 'abandoned', 'So', 'why', 'watch', 'Alien', 'Nine', 'Yuri', ""n't"", 'given', 'up', 'yet', 'Lonely', 'terrified', 'onward', 'crying', 'having', 'nightmares', 'unable', 'aim', 'dart', 'gun', 'one', 'genuinely', 'stunning', 'scene', 'price', 'whole', 'DVD', 'turning', 'killing', 'attackers', 'Alien', 'Nine', 'not', 'aliens', 'yucksome', 'otherwise', 'superb', 'exploration', 'what', 'alienation', 'truly', 'being', 'child', 'having', 'grow', 'up', 'body', 'changing', 'out', 'aliens', 'manga', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'metaphor', 'becoming', 'someone', 'else', 'Not', 'everyone', 'either', 'Unfortunately', 'DVD', 'unfinished', 'do', 'not', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'end', 'part', 'message', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'not', 'really', 'how', 'life', 'will', 'turn', 'out', 'meantime', 'Alien', 'Nine', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'haunting', 'grim', 'powerful', 'ultimately', 'completely', 'convincing']",N/A
