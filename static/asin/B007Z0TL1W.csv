1539899,A3BT78P0UT2Z5F,B007Z0TL1W,The Brock Lesnar of Reviewing - The Most Hated,"[1, 2]","I was lucky enough to get a digital copy of ""Livid"", a french horror movie from the same team that brought us the outstanding horror film ""Inside (Unrated)"". I really didn't know much about this film except of the directors and for me that was enough to give it a go. What I got from ""Livid"" was confused and unanswered questions though.A young woman named Lucie who has heterochromia (two different color eyes) is starting her first day of in home care for the elderly with a veteran nurse named Catherine. She takes Lucie around to several different patients before they make their last stop at an old mansion where Catherine has Lucie stay in the car for this last visit. While waiting Lucie gets curious and decides to go in. She finds Catherine with an elderly woman in a coma, Catherine knew she would come and was actually waiting for Lucie. She starts to explain that the woman was a famous ballet dancer who lost her young daughter and that there was said to be a treasure of some sort hidden in the house.Catherine tells Lucie she has looked all over but could never find anything. Later Lucie meets with her boyfriend who is a young fisherman and she tells him of the treasure at which time he starts concocting a plot to find it. Later that night along with a friend, a reluctant Lucie and her boyfriend break in and start their search for the treasure only to find that the riches they thought they'd find are something much more horrific.I took this movie as a kind of haunted vampire film which I really wanted to love but sadly ended up only liking to an extent. It took almost an hour before it starting getting good and by the time it ending I was a little dissatisfied. Some events in the film were unanswered and left me wondering an scratching my head, I would say what but I really don't want to give anything away. The overall mood was eerie and creepy along with a fitting soundtrack of violins and piano which gave it a nice touch. The acting was good, no complaints except for the use of Beatrice Dalle (the menacing woman out for revenge from ""Inside"") who had all but two small cameos in the film. I thought her to be the main villain at first but was totally let down by her role.It is a unique film with vampires, human automaton and revenge along with a few twists and a little gore that deserves at least a viewing or two. Overall its a beautiful film to watch and is interesting but starts off slow an leaves you a little confused with questions of why certain things happened by the end.",3,"""Confused and Unanswered""",1351296000,"10 27, 2012",2012,2521,"['was', 'lucky', 'enough', 'get', 'digital', 'copy', 'Livid', 'french', 'horror', 'movie', 'same', 'team', 'brought', 'outstanding', 'horror', 'film', 'Inside', 'Unrated', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'film', 'directors', 'was', 'enough', 'give', 'go', 'What', 'got', 'Livid', 'was', 'confused', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'though.A', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Lucie', 'who', 'heterochromia', 'two', 'different', 'color', 'eyes', 'starting', 'first', 'day', 'home', 'care', 'elderly', 'veteran', 'nurse', 'named', 'Catherine', 'Lucie', 'several', 'different', 'patients', 'make', 'last', 'stop', 'old', 'mansion', 'where', 'Catherine', 'Lucie', 'stay', 'car', 'last', 'visit', 'waiting', 'Lucie', 'curious', 'go', 'Catherine', 'elderly', 'woman', 'coma', 'Catherine', 'knew', 'would', 'come', 'was', 'actually', 'waiting', 'Lucie', 'explain', 'woman', 'was', 'famous', 'ballet', 'dancer', 'who', 'lost', 'young', 'daughter', 'was', 'said', 'be', 'treasure', 'sort', 'hidden', 'house.Catherine', 'Lucie', 'looked', 'could', 'never', 'find', 'anything', 'Later', 'Lucie', 'meets', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'young', 'fisherman', 'treasure', 'time', 'concocting', 'plot', 'find', 'Later', 'night', 'friend', 'reluctant', 'Lucie', 'boyfriend', 'break', 'start', 'search', 'treasure', 'only', 'find', 'riches', 'thought', ""'d"", 'find', 'are', 'something', 'much', 'more', 'horrific.I', 'took', 'movie', 'kind', 'haunted', 'vampire', 'film', 'really', 'wanted', 'love', 'sadly', 'ended', 'up', 'only', 'liking', 'extent', 'took', 'almost', 'hour', 'starting', 'getting', 'good', 'time', 'ending', 'was', 'little', 'dissatisfied', 'events', 'film', 'were', 'unanswered', 'left', 'wondering', 'scratching', 'head', 'would', 'say', 'what', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'overall', 'mood', 'was', 'eerie', 'creepy', 'fitting', 'soundtrack', 'violins', 'piano', 'gave', 'nice', 'touch', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'complaints', 'use', 'Beatrice', 'Dalle', 'menacing', 'woman', 'revenge', 'Inside', 'who', 'had', 'two', 'small', 'cameos', 'film', 'thought', 'be', 'main', 'villain', 'first', 'was', 'totally', 'let', 'down', 'role.It', 'unique', 'film', 'vampires', 'human', 'automaton', 'revenge', 'few', 'twists', 'little', 'gore', 'least', 'viewing', 'two', 'Overall', 'beautiful', 'film', 'watch', 'interesting', 'off', 'slow', 'leaves', 'little', 'confused', 'questions', 'why', 'certain', 'things', 'happened', 'end']",N/A
