The story is basically the same as the first two versions and the book. The 1962 movie was very good for it's day, and the bbc 1981 version which is available on dvd is very good too. Niether of course had the cgi effects this one does. However they are superior in content to this one;  this one as good as it is; seems to take place way too quickly. This story takes place over months and not a week?  but to be honest; my mind was while watching this  assuming that it was taking place over a long time.  On amazon.uk this was trashed by reviewers but I think they are wrong ,it's an ok flick. And Vanessa Redgrave is excellent as a deranged nun , but you can see the point of reviewers there; the bbc is out to make alot of flicks with christian badguys; but then rarely has muslim ones. And they are faced with muslim mobs chanting ""death to england!"" why don't they go out and shout 'stop stoning women in iran!""? , anyways the movie follows the story well enough; but  the 1981 version is better acted and more character driven. You should watch that one for sure!  This has a few deleted scenes and lots of extras too. The picture is fantastic on blu ray and they need to put this out over here. However you can play this on your blu ray player anyways.  This movie did horrify me , just as the first two versions did , the thought of a world blinded is terrible enough, but one blinded with man eating plants on the loose and everyone is doomed is a true nightmare. You can't go wrong with any version of this movie. OR the the classic book this came from either.  But if you must buy this one , then get the others because they are great views even if their effects are not as good as this versions.

This one really comes up short for me when compared to the 80's version mini-series from the BBC that ably starred John Duttine and Emma Relph (see my review).  So many problems... beginning with the overblown Eddie Izzard character who awakens from a deep sleep on board an airplane, instantly diagnoses the situation and emerges from the horrific crash via a plot device I sure hope nobody ever really tries!  The storyline barely establishes the main characters, there is no real connection made between them and a soulless semi-romance ensues quite late in the story.  Frankly, it sure seemed that the writers had a bunch of original character names and stuck all of them in along the way without regard to the fabric of a storyline.  The time frame given is over the course of two nights - Superman himself would be hard pressed to cover all the ground, resolve all the plot lines and accomplish all that occurs in this movie.
