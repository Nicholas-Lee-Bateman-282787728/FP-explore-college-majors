This is a Bill Cosby production and I am sure that he meant well, but this was poorly directed and even poorly written.  It starts out one way and then ends another.  In the end we do not get to see what happened in the beginning topic even if we can speculate.I guess this is one of those that must be forgotten even by Cosby himself.  The good part is, I can tell that this must take place in Bridgeport, CT since the film made reference to ""St. Vincent's Hospital,"" Cosby had to make a trip UP to ""Hartford"" and of course - a friend wanted to take the kids to ""Rye Playland"" which is just over the CT border in NY. Not to mention it shows what looks like the Westchester County Airport at the start of the film as well. I even noticed the old school CT and NY plates on some cars.  For this alone I recommend this.  I am biased.  It's not really that good but it is something to see if you have not seen it.",3,I Guess It's Good.,1312848000,"08 9, 2011",2011,1036,"['Obscure', 'never', 'heard', 'figured', 'was', 'made', 'TV', 'film', 'hour', 'ten', 'minutes', 'not', '90', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'production', 'am', 'sure', 'meant', 'well', 'was', 'poorly', 'directed', 'even', 'poorly', 'written', 'out', 'one', 'way', 'then', 'end', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'see', 'what', 'happened', 'beginning', 'topic', 'even', 'can', 'speculate.I', 'guess', 'one', 'must', 'be', 'forgotten', 'even', 'Cosby', 'good', 'part', 'can', 'tell', 'must', 'take', 'place', 'Bridgeport', 'CT', 'film', 'made', 'reference', 'St.', 'Vincent', 'Hospital', 'Cosby', 'had', 'make', 'trip', 'UP', 'Hartford', 'course', 'friend', 'wanted', 'take', 'kids', 'Rye', 'Playland', 'just', 'CT', 'border', 'NY', 'Not', 'mention', 'what', 'Westchester', 'County', 'Airport', 'start', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'even', 'noticed', 'old', 'school', 'CT', 'NY', 'plates', 'cars', 'alone', 'recommend', 'am', 'biased', 'not', 'really', 'good', 'something', 'see', 'have', 'not', 'seen']",N/A
871089,A2BEU7GPGNIG44,B0006MYUR6,Dorrie Wheeler,"[6, 6]","This is truly an excellent film.  Bill Cosby stars as a Blue who is hardworking father.  He is married to Serena, a former housekeeper who is going to school in the evening to be a nurse.  They have one son, a young boy name Vandy.  Vandy seems like he might be in 6th or 7th grade.  Vandy is selfish, spoiled by his mother who coddles him like a young toddler, and disrespectful towards his father.  Nothing is good enough for him.  He wonders why he can't go to the amusement park and why his family only has an old car they call Esmerelda rather than a Cadillac.Blue just wants to move his family into a home.  The house he has in mind appears to be abandoned but Blue has big dreams for this house.  Sadly, Serena doesn't share his vision for them one day being homeowners.  Throughout the film Vandy has a few little scenes that give the viewers the idea that he might be sick but how sick is shocking.  Vandy has a bad case of Sickle Cell Anemia.  Bill Cosby as Blue seemed more like a real person than he did in all of the years of the Cosby Show.  It was great to see him play a dramatic role.",5,Doesn't Deserve The Bargain Basement Treatment!,1131062400,"11 4, 2005",2005,1101,"['truly', 'excellent', 'film', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'Blue', 'who', 'hardworking', 'father', 'married', 'Serena', 'former', 'housekeeper', 'who', 'going', 'school', 'evening', 'be', 'nurse', 'have', 'one', 'son', 'young', 'boy', 'name', 'Vandy', 'Vandy', 'might', 'be', '6th', '7th', 'grade', 'Vandy', 'selfish', 'spoiled', 'mother', 'who', 'young', 'toddler', 'disrespectful', 'towards', 'father', 'Nothing', 'good', 'enough', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'amusement', 'park', 'why', 'family', 'only', 'old', 'car', 'call', 'Esmerelda', 'rather', 'Cadillac.Blue', 'just', 'move', 'family', 'home', 'house', 'mind', 'be', 'abandoned', 'Blue', 'big', 'dreams', 'house', 'Sadly', 'Serena', ""n't"", 'share', 'vision', 'one', 'day', 'being', 'homeowners', 'film', 'Vandy', 'few', 'little', 'scenes', 'give', 'viewers', 'idea', 'might', 'be', 'sick', 'how', 'sick', 'shocking', 'Vandy', 'bad', 'case', 'Sickle', 'Cell', 'Anemia', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'Blue', 'seemed', 'more', 'real', 'person', 'did', 'years', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'was', 'great', 'see', 'play', 'dramatic', 'role']",N/A

When not working his two regular jobs, he is out doing extra odd jobs which leaves no time for his son Vandy.  They ride around in an old station wagon and do not have color TV like some of the other families in the projects.  Being a typical kid, Vandy wonders out loud to his father why they can not have these things as well.  Blue has to explain to Vandy the types of (illegal) activities those other parents do to attain those color TVs and Cadillacs.  His wife (Gloria Foster) tries to explain to Blue that Vandy needs his time not a house.  Vandy collapses while playing with the neighborhood kids and after a series of tests they learn that he has sickle cell anemia and will not live very long.  The dream of a house now seems unimportant to Blue as he struggle with the fact that a poor man has very few choices when it comes to health care for his child.  A very realistic story.

I remembered the actress Gloria Foster, so I had to find a filmography for her to get the name of the movie. I also remembered the son's name ""Vandy"". I was happy to actually find the movie. The movie starred Bill Cosby (pre Cosby show) as a father who is desperately trying to get his family out of a housing project. He sets his sights on an old, rundown house he wants to buy and restore. Blue, as his character is named scrimps, saves and scavenges things from the side of the road or wherever he finds them and sells them.While Blue is planning for the future his young son Vandy is being denied a normal childhood, because of all the scrimping and saving. Vandy is diagnosed with an incurable disease and Blue decides to change his ways. Gloria Foster plays Bills wife and Vandy's mother Serena, who constantly tell her husband to allow Vandy to be a normal child. Good television movie made in 1972, so picture quality is okay.
