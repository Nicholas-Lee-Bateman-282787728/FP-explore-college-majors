Filmmaker Andrea Arnold is quite talented; what's on screen is a combination of strikingly realistic, grubby Glasgow and moody, disquieting interiors. It's gripping till you get to the end, and commendable for creating characters of real interest and sympathy, but the resolution of the story, without giving it away, is unfortunately a bit facile, not entirely credible, and too obviously marked by symbolization.

1074523,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B000Q7ZKX4,C. O. DeRiemer,"[3, 5]","Flip a coin...on one side, a marvelous look to Red Road (in a grubby part of Glasgow), seriously good direction by Andrea Arnold and photography by Robbie Ryan, a disturbing opening that combines high-tech gloom with intrusive and ever-watching Big Government, the puzzlement of motivations and the fine acting by the two leads, especially by Kate Dickie as Jackie Morrison....on the other side, the major motivation of Jackie is unlikely and her plan involves an act of intimacy that seemed, to me, exploitive. Come on, close-ups of oral sex?  Red Road slowly veers into, as so many small, independent movies do, the soggy exploration of  ""the human condition"" and the even soggier conclusion of either redemption or no-hope-for redemption among just folks.The movie is so good for the first three-quarters that I felt let down with the ending.Jackie's job is to monitor the live, full-time activities of Glasgow's people as captured by all the cameras the city has installed all over the crummier parts of town. She sees a man shagging a woman against a wall. She calls in a police car (as I recall) and then we realize she's acting a bit peculiar. She recognizes the man, an ex-con. We also realize that Jackie seems to have no friends although she can be friendly. She leads a lonely life, including the mechanical lovemaking with a married man in the back of his car every week. Using the monitors, she begins to obsessively track after this man, whose name is Clyde Henderson (Tony Curran). She finds ways to meet him, bed him and implicate him in a way that that will send him back to prison. And then...Well, see the movie for yourself. The movie is good enough that you shouldn't take my opinion or anyone else's. Red Road, by the way, is the name of a dirty, subsidized, high-rise vertical slum. Unless you were into small-time crime, drugs, were averse to cleaning the halls and your own apartment or were obsessed, I'd keep walking by.

She spends her days and nights watching the streets and tenements of the city and she seems to have developed a greater empathy for the people she watches over than for her colleagues and few remaining friends. Then, one day, she spots a face from the past on one of her cameras and an obsession develops...Red Road is a 2006 film, the first of a trilogy to be filmed in the Dogme style - location filming on hand held cameras using natural lighting etc. As such it is a stark, harsh and somewhat unsettling experience. If you've come here for ""entertainment"", thrills, action, laughs, etc, then you've come to the wrong place. I won't be so pretentious to describe it as ""thought-provoking"" as I rarely know which thoughts need to be provoked watching such films. It is however a deeply absorbing film. It also piles on the tension: not the classic ""thriller"" style of tension but something a good deal more organic. The protagonist, Jackie, played by a relatvely unknown Kate Dickie, lives her life like a coiled spring. Normally this is barely discernible, but when she spots Clyde Henderson (Tony Curran) on one of her cameras it begins to build until they finally meet, when the tension reaches an almost scream-inducing level. Dickie's performance is quite astonishing - a strange, understated blend of detachment, sadness and manic obsession - she carries off the simple act of lighting and smoking a cigarette to pefection.The film's Glaswegian location is also beautifully rendered (if beautiful could ever be used in that context). The depiction of a seedy, run down, almost post-apcalyptic landscape will attract few tourists, that's for sure, but the simple, unpretentions camera work conveys a powerful sense of place.This is surely a difficult film to watch. The stark location, the unadorned realism of the production, the rising tension. Worse still, the audience is left largely in ignorance of Jackie and Clyde's back-story until close to the end. There's also a particularly explicit sex-scene towards the end which comes like a slap in the face (apologies if that's a spoiler of sorts).Red Road won a number of BAFTAs as well as a Cannes prize. It's not entertainment in the popular sense, but it IS a great film.",4,"Harsh, hard to watch yet gripping, like a headache",1336953600,"05 14, 2012",2012,2271,"['Jackie', 'CCTV', 'operator', 'Glasgow', 'days', 'nights', 'watching', 'streets', 'tenements', 'city', 'have', 'developed', 'greater', 'empathy', 'people', 'colleagues', 'few', 'remaining', 'friends', 'Then', 'one', 'day', 'spots', 'face', 'past', 'one', 'cameras', 'obsession', 'Red', 'Road', '2006', 'film', 'first', 'trilogy', 'be', 'filmed', 'Dogme', 'style', 'location', 'filming', 'hand', 'held', 'cameras', 'using', 'natural', 'lighting', 'etc', 'such', 'stark', 'harsh', 'somewhat', 'unsettling', 'experience', ""'ve"", 'come', 'here', 'entertainment', 'thrills', 'action', 'etc', 'then', ""'ve"", 'come', 'wrong', 'place', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'pretentious', 'describe', 'thought-provoking', 'rarely', 'know', 'thoughts', 'need', 'be', 'provoked', 'watching', 'such', 'films', 'however', 'deeply', 'absorbing', 'film', 'also', 'tension', 'not', 'classic', 'thriller', 'style', 'tension', 'something', 'good', 'deal', 'more', 'organic', 'protagonist', 'Jackie', 'played', 'relatvely', 'unknown', 'Kate', 'Dickie', 'life', 'coiled', 'spring', 'Normally', 'barely', 'discernible', 'when', 'spots', 'Clyde', 'Henderson', 'Tony', 'Curran', 'one', 'cameras', 'build', 'finally', 'meet', 'when', 'tension', 'almost', 'scream-inducing', 'level', 'Dickie', 'performance', 'quite', 'astonishing', 'strange', 'understated', 'blend', 'detachment', 'sadness', 'manic', 'obsession', 'simple', 'act', 'lighting', 'smoking', 'cigarette', 'pefection.The', 'film', 'Glaswegian', 'location', 'also', 'beautifully', 'rendered', 'beautiful', 'could', 'ever', 'be', 'used', 'context', 'depiction', 'seedy', 'run', 'down', 'almost', 'post-apcalyptic', 'landscape', 'will', 'attract', 'few', 'tourists', 'sure', 'simple', 'unpretentions', 'camera', 'work', 'conveys', 'powerful', 'sense', 'place.This', 'surely', 'difficult', 'film', 'watch', 'stark', 'location', 'unadorned', 'realism', 'production', 'rising', 'tension', 'Worse', 'still', 'audience', 'left', 'largely', 'ignorance', 'Jackie', 'Clyde', 'back-story', 'close', 'end', 'also', 'particularly', 'explicit', 'sex-scene', 'towards', 'end', 'slap', 'face', 'apologies', 'spoiler', 'sorts', '.Red', 'Road', 'won', 'number', 'BAFTAs', 'as', 'well', 'Cannes', 'prize', 'not', 'entertainment', 'popular', 'sense', 'great', 'film']",N/A

This felon named Clyde Henderson, played by Tony Curran, had intersected Jackie's life once before, although he doesn't remember her; she sure remembers him.

A film like this doesn't get wide release in the States and even a casual viewer will see why after only a short time into this puzzle of a film.Here's the scoop. We meet a young lady in Glasgow, Scotland, who works for the police as someone who sits in a room and and looks at video monitors which are fed by the many cameras placed around the city. The area she monitors includes the ""Red Road"" district of the title. She needs to alert the police if anything bad happens or appears about to happen. She takes note of a guy who she recognizes as having just gotten out of prison and that's where things take off.This is a singular movie in many ways. The directing is such that it makes it seem as though you're viewing a documentary. Part of this is that you're seeing many people on video monitors fed from crude street cameras. It's as though you're watching real people as opposed to actors. Also is the lighting. I don't know how much of the lighting, if any, is set lighting. It looks as though it were all natural lighting which gives it the documentary feel. Then there are the sets. This is set in, what must be, a lower income part of Glasgow. It's a messy part of the city with a lot of graffiti. It all looks nasty and run down.Then there's the story. Things unfold (or don't unfold) in an odd manner. Things are happening. Clues are given. But I was well into the story and I still didn't know what was going on. I thought I must have missed something crucial early on. As it turns out I didn't. It just goes a long way before the reasons people do what they do and say what they say are revealed. I found this frustrating. And at a nearly two hour running time it was also a bit exasperating. As much as I liked a lot of what I saw this was a big sticking point. I'm all for pushing the envelope on film making but I think the audience needs to be taken into consideration and I could have used a bit more of that here.This is well worth watching and a very important addition to the art.

1074534,A2QDSG599HSWVA,B000Q7ZKX4,Patrick Wilkinson,"[0, 0]","""Red Road"" is an emotionally taut drama centered around a CCTV operator in Glasgow.  Jackie, played by Kate Dickie lives a simple life monitoring the CCTV's and coordinating with local police.  One day, she notices someone that she recognizes on one of the screens.  Tony Curran plays Clyde whom is the star of Jackie's new obsession.  What follows is nearly an hour and a half of her following this man growing more and more close to him.  It is not until over an hour that we learn bits and pieces of why she has engaged in this cat and mouse game.  The way the film was shot begs us to be patient as the answers unfold, which is a great aspect of this movie though the final outcome is a let down.As I said before the movie takes place in Glasgow.  Now, I am normally pretty good at understanding British and Irish dialects; however, I was having a terrible time understanding most of what was said in this movie.  The Scottish accent is impossible to understand at times.  I wish it would have been subtitled as maybe I could have gotten more involved in the dialogue.  For a film reliant so heavily on the script, it was a difficult watch and took a lot away from the impact of the actions on screen.The plot was an interesting one, but it inevitably fails.  I suppose it was a piece more on forgiveness than redemption but the style in which they filmed it was not conducive to learning the lesson they were trying to portray.  This film has a really gritty feel to it and was shot beautifully.  Cinematographer Robbie Ryan did an amazing job building a very tense atmosphere.  His use of shadows and colors really draws the audience into the set pieces.  I found myself on pins and needles expecting something incredibly moving or emotional.  Sadly, I never quite got there.""Red Road"" has gotten a lot of great reviews on IMDB (6.8/10) and Rotten Tomatoes (88%).  I think the reason for this was the cinematography and the acting.  Both were outstanding.  Katie Dickie and Tony Curran have great chemistry on screen and both seemed to give their all to this project.  It's a shame that the film ended the way it did because these two actors could have really pushed the envelope had their been a different avenue to go in.I really only found one thing that stood out as far as direction goes.  That is the way Arnold builds the tension.  She only allows small bits of information to come through progressing the story at any given moment.  A decision that worked well with the films photography.  I was reminded of Michael Haneke who is one of my most favorite directors.  This was Andrea Arnold's first full length feature film, had it not been for the actors and cinematography I don't think this movie would have been such a success.So, is this a thriller? A drama?  Or, a mixture of both?  For me, the only thing that could put this in the ""thriller"" genre is the slow pace and the tension.  Other than that, this is a drama.  Many reviews say as a thriller this works, but for me it just falls flat.  I feel like the director should have stuck to one genre.  In my opinion the movie would have been much more powerful had it kept the plot and was shot as a drama or changed the plot and shot as a thriller.[...]",3,Disappointing Ending to an otherwise well made film,1289952000,"11 17, 2010",2010,3223,"['Red', 'Road', 'emotionally', 'taut', 'drama', 'centered', 'CCTV', 'operator', 'Glasgow', 'Jackie', 'played', 'Kate', 'Dickie', 'simple', 'life', 'monitoring', 'CCTV', 'coordinating', 'local', 'police', 'One', 'day', 'someone', 'one', 'screens', 'Tony', 'Curran', 'Clyde', 'whom', 'star', 'Jackie', 'new', 'obsession', 'What', 'nearly', 'hour', 'half', 'following', 'man', 'growing', 'more', 'more', 'close', 'not', 'hour', 'learn', 'bits', 'pieces', 'why', 'engaged', 'cat', 'mouse', 'game', 'way', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'begs', 'be', 'patient', 'answers', 'unfold', 'great', 'aspect', 'movie', 'final', 'outcome', 'let', 'down.As', 'said', 'movie', 'place', 'Glasgow', 'Now', 'am', 'normally', 'pretty', 'good', 'understanding', 'British', 'Irish', 'dialects', 'however', 'was', 'having', 'terrible', 'time', 'understanding', 'most', 'what', 'was', 'said', 'movie', 'Scottish', 'accent', 'impossible', 'understand', 'times', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'subtitled', 'maybe', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', 'more', 'involved', 'dialogue', 'film', 'reliant', 'heavily', 'script', 'was', 'difficult', 'watch', 'took', 'lot', 'away', 'impact', 'actions', 'screen.The', 'plot', 'was', 'interesting', 'one', 'inevitably', 'suppose', 'was', 'piece', 'more', 'forgiveness', 'redemption', 'style', 'filmed', 'was', 'not', 'conducive', 'learning', 'lesson', 'were', 'trying', 'portray', 'film', 'really', 'gritty', 'feel', 'was', 'shot', 'beautifully', 'Cinematographer', 'Robbie', 'Ryan', 'did', 'amazing', 'job', 'building', 'very', 'tense', 'atmosphere', 'use', 'shadows', 'colors', 'really', 'audience', 'set', 'pieces', 'found', 'pins', 'needles', 'expecting', 'something', 'incredibly', 'moving', 'emotional', 'Sadly', 'never', 'quite', 'got', 'there', 'Red', 'Road', 'gotten', 'lot', 'great', 'reviews', 'IMDB', '6.8/10', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', '88', '%', 'think', 'reason', 'was', 'cinematography', 'acting', 'were', 'outstanding', 'Katie', 'Dickie', 'Tony', 'Curran', 'have', 'great', 'chemistry', 'screen', 'seemed', 'give', 'project', 'shame', 'film', 'ended', 'way', 'did', 'two', 'actors', 'could', 'have', 'really', 'pushed', 'envelope', 'had', 'been', 'different', 'avenue', 'go', 'in.I', 'really', 'only', 'found', 'one', 'thing', 'stood', 'out', 'as', 'far', 'direction', 'way', 'Arnold', 'tension', 'only', 'small', 'bits', 'information', 'come', 'progressing', 'story', 'given', 'moment', 'decision', 'worked', 'well', 'films', 'photography', 'was', 'reminded', 'Michael', 'Haneke', 'who', 'one', 'most', 'favorite', 'directors', 'was', 'Andrea', 'Arnold', 'first', 'full', 'length', 'feature', 'film', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'actors', 'cinematography', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'success.So', 'thriller', 'drama', 'mixture', 'only', 'thing', 'could', 'put', 'thriller', 'genre', 'slow', 'pace', 'tension', 'Other', 'drama', 'Many', 'reviews', 'say', 'thriller', 'just', 'flat', 'feel', 'director', 'should', 'have', 'stuck', 'one', 'genre', 'opinion', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'powerful', 'had', 'kept', 'plot', 'was', 'shot', 'drama', 'changed', 'plot', 'shot', 'thriller.', '[', ']']",N/A

We are only a step behind her own awareness, her own motives, as she literally lays herself bare, sacrifices her dignity, to absolve the trauma that has frozen her.

On the other hand, while there isn't anything in here you haven't seen before, it's the way in which Andrea Arnold puts all the pieces together that make it feel like it is, at least in part, something you have never seen before. That is the tightrope makers of genre film walk, and Arnold&#8212;helped along in her pursuit by some very big names&#8212;walks it pretty well. The end result is not perfect by any means, but given a director working on her first feature and having a lot to measure up to, Red Road is better than it has any right to be.Plot: Jackie (Outcast's Kate Dickie) is a security guard whose entire job involves watching CCTV cameras trained on the Red Road housing estate in Glasgow. She is the quintessential character with no life outside her job, and eventually we realize why when she spies a familiar face on one of her cameras. This is someone who should not be where he is at the time he is, and Jackie soon becomes obsessed with getting revenge for a long-ago act that shattered her life.Those names I mentioned? This is the first of a series of three films (the second is Morag McKinnon's 2010 effort Donkeys) proposed by Danish filmmaker Lars von Trier (Antichrist) and featuring characters created by fellow Danes Lone Scherfig (Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself) and Anders Thomas Jensen (The Green Butchers). In America, that's kind of the equivalent of Steven Spielberg calling you up and saying &#8220;hey, I've got this collection of characters who were created by Jon Jost and Ricardo Islas, and I want you and two of your buddies to write scripts around them.&#8221; How much pressure would you be feeling? Still, while Arnold is building tension, this movie works quite well. It is a quiet thriller, but it is a thriller nonetheless, and there is a great deal to be said for Arnold's script spending time to establish the parallel between Jackie becoming obsessed with her prey and getting less socially awkward around others. Where things fall apart is when the action begins in the third act. Obviously it would be difficult to talk about how things go down without spoiler alerts, but it felt to me like a bait-and-switch. Arnold has set us up to be expecting one kind of movie and we ended up getting another. That is not necessarily a bad thing, but it is likely to put some viewers off. With me, the jury is still out. I liked it, albeit cautiously, and I would recommend you take a look. Go into it without expectations and you may find yourself pleasantly surprised. ** ",3,Surveillance.,1401321600,"05 29, 2014",2014,2729,"['Red', 'Road', 'Andrea', 'Arnold', '2006', 'one', 'hand', 'Red', 'Road', '8212', 'movie', 'woman', 'who', 'obsessed', 'revenge', 'undercover', 'deliver', 'vigilante', 'justice', '8212', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'thousand', 'times', 'other', 'hand', ""n't"", 'anything', 'here', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'way', 'Andrea', 'Arnold', 'pieces', 'together', 'make', 'feel', 'least', 'part', 'something', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'tightrope', 'makers', 'genre', 'film', 'walk', 'Arnold', '8212', 'helped', 'along', 'pursuit', 'very', 'big', 'names', '8212', 'walks', 'pretty', 'well', 'end', 'result', 'not', 'perfect', 'means', 'given', 'director', 'working', 'first', 'feature', 'having', 'lot', 'measure', 'up', 'Red', 'Road', 'better', 'right', 'be.Plot', 'Jackie', 'Outcast', 'Kate', 'Dickie', 'security', 'guard', 'entire', 'job', 'watching', 'CCTV', 'cameras', 'trained', 'Red', 'Road', 'housing', 'estate', 'Glasgow', 'quintessential', 'character', 'life', 'job', 'eventually', 'realize', 'why', 'when', 'familiar', 'face', 'one', 'cameras', 'someone', 'who', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'where', 'time', 'Jackie', 'soon', 'obsessed', 'getting', 'revenge', 'long-ago', 'act', 'shattered', 'life.Those', 'names', 'mentioned', 'first', 'series', 'three', 'films', 'second', 'Morag', 'McKinnon', '2010', 'effort', 'Donkeys', 'proposed', 'Danish', 'filmmaker', 'Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'Antichrist', 'featuring', 'characters', 'created', 'fellow', 'Danes', 'Lone', 'Scherfig', 'Wilbur', 'Wants', 'Kill', 'Himself', 'Anders', 'Thomas', 'Jensen', 'Green', 'Butchers', 'America', 'kind', 'equivalent', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'calling', 'saying', '8220', 'hey', ""'ve"", 'got', 'collection', 'characters', 'who', 'were', 'created', 'Jon', 'Jost', 'Ricardo', 'Islas', 'want', 'two', 'buddies', 'write', 'scripts', 'them.', '8221', 'How', 'much', 'pressure', 'would', 'be', 'feeling', 'Still', 'Arnold', 'building', 'tension', 'movie', 'quite', 'well', 'quiet', 'thriller', 'thriller', 'nonetheless', 'great', 'deal', 'be', 'said', 'Arnold', 'script', 'spending', 'time', 'establish', 'parallel', 'Jackie', 'becoming', 'obsessed', 'prey', 'getting', 'less', 'socially', 'awkward', 'others', 'Where', 'things', 'fall', 'apart', 'when', 'action', 'third', 'act', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'talk', 'how', 'things', 'go', 'down', 'spoiler', 'alerts', 'felt', 'bait-and-switch', 'Arnold', 'set', 'be', 'expecting', 'one', 'kind', 'movie', 'ended', 'up', 'getting', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'likely', 'put', 'viewers', 'off', 'jury', 'still', 'liked', 'cautiously', 'would', 'recommend', 'take', 'look', 'Go', 'expectations', 'may', 'find', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', '**']",N/A

As an employee of the city of Gloscow, Scotland, her job is to monitor the security cameras that have been strategically placed throughout the city and to report any suspicious activity or possible crimes she sees to the local authorities.  For the most part, she keeps a respectful distance from those she's observing, contenting herself with following the course of their lives as a generally dispassionate observer.  That all changes, however, when one night, much to her horror, she spots the man, who was recently convicted in the deaths of her husband and daughter, walking freely through the streets of the city, his sentence overturned on a technicality.  Jackie decides that she must now take matters into her own hands to procure for herself and for her loved ones the justice the legal system has clearly denied them.""Red Road"" is a taut, tantalizing thriller that turns into a touching human drama in its closing stages.  For most of the movie, Jackie is obsessed with exacting revenge on the man who destroyed her life.  She follows him around, first through the various monitors that record his every public move, then in person as she literally stalks him through the streets of the city.  It is at this point that Jackie crosses over the line from passive observer to active manipulator of events.  At times, her obsession seems to take on an almost erotic tone, particularly after she makes personal contact with him several times, making this yet another forbidden line Jackie threatens to cross.  Yet, the movie is much more than a mere tale of erotic obsession; it is a complex study of the stages a grieving soul must go through before it can finally let go of the past, confer forgiveness when forgiveness seems least possible, and achieve the peace it so achingly longs for.Kate Dickie is both intense and poignant as the woman trying to come to terms with her overwhelming tragedy.  In an intriguing example of the media becoming the message, director Andrea Arnold keeps her camera tightly focused on the character at all times, almost as if we, too, were watching Jackie's life as though through a monitor.  Tony Curran is also very effective as the man who may not be quite as evil as Jackie has convinced herself that he is.By holding her cards close to the vest, Arnold never reveals more of the mystery than we need to know at any given time.  We don't always understand exactly what is going on or why Jackie acts in the way she does, but this ambiguity only heightens our desire to see the story through to the end.  And that ending, when it comes, is a beautiful and richly rewarding one, as the movie takes us to a place we hadn't expected it to at any point prior to its arrival.Two caveats may be in order, however, one fairly minor, the other quite major.  The minor one is that the heavy Scottish accents make much of the dialogue virtually incomprehensible to those of us with more Western-oriented ears.  Luckily, the filmmakers have headed off the problem by kindly providing subtitles for us.  The more serious warning involves a graphic sex scene later on in the film in which the action is anything but simulated.

It was a real reflection of life in certain parts of Glasgow.  Set in the East end of Glasgow around the Red Road Flats which are famous for housing Asylum seekers, people on Welfare and very low income families it could never be a happy story.  Having worked closely to these blocks of flats and coming into contact with the people living around that area I can truly say it was a fair representation.Some people will struggle with the accents but one would expect this from a Scottish movie trying to show ""real"" people and how they talk and live, so it would be unfair to list that as a complaint against the movie.  It just would not be the same movie without the broad accents.It was interesting to see behind the surveillance cameras that are prevalent around the streets of Glasgow - primarily installed to monitor any potential trouble and stop it before it happens.  It made me think about some of my own nights out in Glasgow many years ago and wonder who was watching some of my drunken escapades!A well done, low budget movie that will appeal to anyone who likes to get away from the Hollywood outpourings at times.",5,True Scot,1348185600,"09 21, 2012",2012,1354,"['Being', 'originally', 'Glasgow', 'movie', 'was', 'originally', 'recommended', 'one', 'American', 'friends', 'comment', 'would', 'be', 'interested', 'hear', 'opinion', 'was', 'real', 'reflection', 'life', 'Glasgow', 'was', 'real', 'reflection', 'life', 'certain', 'parts', 'Glasgow', 'Set', 'East', 'end', 'Glasgow', 'Red', 'Road', 'Flats', 'are', 'famous', 'housing', 'Asylum', 'seekers', 'people', 'Welfare', 'very', 'low', 'income', 'families', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'happy', 'story', 'Having', 'worked', 'closely', 'blocks', 'flats', 'coming', 'contact', 'people', 'living', 'area', 'can', 'truly', 'say', 'was', 'fair', 'representation.Some', 'people', 'will', 'struggle', 'accents', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'Scottish', 'movie', 'trying', 'show', 'real', 'people', 'how', 'talk', 'live', 'would', 'be', 'unfair', 'list', 'complaint', 'movie', 'just', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'same', 'movie', 'broad', 'accents.It', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'surveillance', 'cameras', 'are', 'prevalent', 'streets', 'Glasgow', 'primarily', 'installed', 'monitor', 'potential', 'trouble', 'stop', 'made', 'think', 'own', 'nights', 'out', 'Glasgow', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'wonder', 'who', 'was', 'watching', 'drunken', 'escapades', 'well', 'done', 'low', 'budget', 'movie', 'will', 'appeal', 'anyone', 'who', 'get', 'away', 'Hollywood', 'outpourings', 'times']",N/A

Clyde is someone from Jackie's past, but just how he's connected to her is still unknown. She simply crossed the street and started shouting at him, and he looks surprised and a bit afraid of her.Red Road is the astonishing and unforgettable story of Jackie, a CCTV operator who must confront her past in order to wake up from the stupor of her self-imposed isolation.""The film is called RED ROAD because it's set in the Red Road flats,' explains Carrie Comerford, the film's producer. These flats are so recognizable that they have become a landmark in that part of Glasgow. But the film could have been made in any other city and Jackie's story would remain the same.As one of the CCTV operators, it is here that Jackie works. Everyday she monitors dozens of screens that feed live footage from cameras installed in the city. Here she constantly observes and watches its inhabitants, amused by their idiosyncracies and in a way, knowing them by familiarity. There is the elderly man who regularly walks his dog at night, the lady cleaner who dances her way into the office building while listening to her Walkman, the prostitute who tries to make conversation with a potential client, the young men who revel in their drunkenness on their way up to the flats...These seemingly nameless `strangers' are her constant companions. She knows them almost intimately, but they remain beyond her reach; she cannot talk to them or have them invite her for coffee. She watches silently, the cameras allowing her to observe them from a distance. Until one day, she sees someone, a man who has brought so much pain and sorrow. She watches him closely, wondering if she is not mistaken. Then she knows. She simply knows it is him. She decides its time to get closer and confront him.What makes this film unique and memorable is the way the story is told. It has a deliberately slow pace and we see bits and pieces of various events - some are reminders of the past, and we learn that Jackie is a woman who has seen better days. Now she is isolated and alone, a choice she took upon herself. Although she has a family, we can feel the tension, for example when she attends her sister's wedding. As we follow her story, we learn that not everything is what it seems.First-time director Andrea Arnold has created a film that is both powerful and poignant, hypnotic and mysterious. It is both a thriller and a modern take on noir. It's an exploration of guilt and despair and ultimately of letting go, probing into the unknown and the familiar. Red Road is a powerful story with an amazing and intelligent cast. The two lead actors, Kate Dickie and Tony Curran, are particularly good. Dickie is unforgettable as Jackie - she portrays a woman on the verge of despair, but one who remains defiant and gutsy as she faces her tormentor. Curran puts in a strong performance as a man who has made too many mistakes, but who wants to live a straight life.The film won the Jury Prize at Cannes, and also garnered major awards at the BAFTAs. There is a certain beauty and honesty in Red Road, something that is so uncommon today.",4,Of Guilt and Forgiveness,1199145600,"01 1, 2008",2008,3279,"['Tell', 'how', 'happened', 'just', 'want', 'know', 'please', 'incident', 'left', 'bewildered', 'shocked', 'Jackie', 'Kate', 'Dickie', 'confronts', 'Clyde', 'Tony', 'Curran', 'Clyde', 'someone', 'Jackie', 'past', 'just', 'how', 'connected', 'still', 'unknown', 'simply', 'crossed', 'street', 'started', 'shouting', 'surprised', 'bit', 'afraid', 'her.Red', 'Road', 'astonishing', 'unforgettable', 'story', 'Jackie', 'CCTV', 'operator', 'who', 'must', 'confront', 'past', 'order', 'wake', 'up', 'stupor', 'self-imposed', 'isolation', 'film', 'called', 'RED', 'ROAD', 'set', 'Red', 'Road', 'flats', 'Carrie', 'Comerford', 'film', 'producer', 'flats', 'are', 'so', 'recognizable', 'have', 'become', 'landmark', 'part', 'Glasgow', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'other', 'city', 'Jackie', 'story', 'would', 'remain', 'same.As', 'one', 'CCTV', 'operators', 'here', 'Jackie', 'Everyday', 'dozens', 'screens', 'feed', 'live', 'footage', 'cameras', 'installed', 'city', 'Here', 'constantly', 'inhabitants', 'amused', 'idiosyncracies', 'way', 'knowing', 'familiarity', 'elderly', 'man', 'who', 'regularly', 'walks', 'dog', 'night', 'lady', 'cleaner', 'who', 'way', 'office', 'building', 'listening', 'Walkman', 'prostitute', 'who', 'make', 'conversation', 'potential', 'client', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'revel', 'drunkenness', 'way', 'flats', 'seemingly', 'nameless', 'strangers', 'are', 'constant', 'companions', 'almost', 'intimately', 'remain', 'reach', 'can', 'not', 'talk', 'have', 'invite', 'coffee', 'silently', 'cameras', 'allowing', 'observe', 'distance', 'one', 'day', 'someone', 'man', 'who', 'brought', 'so', 'much', 'pain', 'sorrow', 'closely', 'wondering', 'not', 'mistaken', 'Then', 'simply', 'time', 'get', 'closer', 'confront', 'him.What', 'film', 'unique', 'memorable', 'way', 'story', 'told', 'deliberately', 'slow', 'pace', 'see', 'bits', 'pieces', 'various', 'events', 'are', 'reminders', 'past', 'learn', 'Jackie', 'woman', 'who', 'seen', 'better', 'days', 'Now', 'isolated', 'alone', 'choice', 'took', 'upon', 'family', 'can', 'feel', 'tension', 'example', 'when', 'sister', 'wedding', 'follow', 'story', 'learn', 'not', 'everything', 'what', 'seems.First-time', 'director', 'Andrea', 'Arnold', 'created', 'film', 'powerful', 'poignant', 'hypnotic', 'mysterious', 'thriller', 'modern', 'take', 'noir', 'exploration', 'guilt', 'despair', 'ultimately', 'letting', 'go', 'probing', 'unknown', 'familiar', 'Red', 'Road', 'powerful', 'story', 'amazing', 'intelligent', 'cast', 'two', 'lead', 'actors', 'Kate', 'Dickie', 'Tony', 'Curran', 'are', 'particularly', 'good', 'Dickie', 'unforgettable', 'Jackie', 'woman', 'verge', 'despair', 'one', 'who', 'defiant', 'gutsy', 'tormentor', 'Curran', 'strong', 'performance', 'man', 'who', 'made', 'too', 'many', 'mistakes', 'who', 'live', 'straight', 'life.The', 'film', 'won', 'Jury', 'Prize', 'Cannes', 'also', 'garnered', 'major', 'awards', 'BAFTAs', 'certain', 'beauty', 'honesty', 'Red', 'Road', 'something', 'so', 'uncommon', 'today']",N/A
