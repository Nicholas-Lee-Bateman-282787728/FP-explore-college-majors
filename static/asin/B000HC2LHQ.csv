However, I'm giving this DVD box set four stars for a couple of reasons.One reason is the lack of English subtitles. I like and expect subtitles and I'm not even hearing-impaired, so I can only imagine the frustration this issue causes for those who are hard of hearing. I'll never understand why a show is closed captioned for broadcast but then doesn't include subtitles on its DVD release. The cost of adding subtitles would seem to be negligible, so omitting them always frustrates me.The special features on this set are sparse, but my single biggest complaint is that it only includes the West Coast version of the live debate episode (two live versions were produced, one for East Coast viewers and one for West Coast viewers).I'm a bit of a television purist in that I want to own the definitive archival version of what was originally aired, so it would've been really nice to have both versions of the live episode.

1011802,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B000HC2LHQ,Craig MACKINNON,"[0, 0]","The long denouement of the West Wing, which essentially started with creator Sorkin's departure at the end of Season 4, wraps up with this 7th season.  We have an election, a transfer of power to the new administration, and the departure of many of our beloved characters from the White House for the last time.  Along the way we have some nifty inside looks at what it's like to run a campaign and a country - this is, after all, what the West Wing does best.  If the stories aren't as compelling as they were in earlier years, and if some soap opera aspects creep into the show, we can forgive it because this show is still better written than any other on TV.The show is at its best when focussing on the lower-level characters.  That's not to say the bigwigs aren't well played - Jimmy Smits is just as good here as he was as a NYC cop on ""Law and Order"", and Alan Alda has never been better.  But we see the faces, debates, and interactions of the bigwigs in real life.  What we don't see are the spin-doctors, the lawyers, and the junior staffers behind the policies and the talking heads.  Originally, Sorkin's vision was to focus solely on the likes of Josh, Sam, Donna, etc., and the best shows of the season are when these characters come to the fore and we learn about the inside workings of a national campaign.  Of vital importance are the two spin-doctors, Republican Bruno and Democrat Louise, and pollster Joey Lucas.  These are the people we don't see in every episode, but they are also the guts of these campaigns, and it's fascinating to watch them work.So the individual shows work, but what about the season as a whole?  As mentioned, there is an unfortunate tendency in some episodes to senitmentality, and no fewer than 5 of the 11 title characters who were previously single end up in relationships by the end of the season (I think this is more than the rest of the series combined, which had 3 notable realtionships involving main characters: Josh/Amy, Sam/Mallory, and Charlie/Zoey).  This is somewhat counteracted by the reappearance (especially in the John Spencer/Leo McGarry funeral) of many forgotten characters: Mallory, all three Bartlet daughters, Sam, Joey Lucas, Special Agent Butterfield, Danny Concannon, Amy, Bruno, and even Emily Procter returns from CSI:Miami to reprise her role as Ainsley in one episode.What about the season as an extended finale for the series as a whole?  I would have liked to have seen more of the original main characters - especially the non-title screen characters like Ginger, Ed and Larry, Nancy McNally, and Debbie, played by the always entertaining Lily Tomlin.  I do like the new characters though: Louise, played by Janeane Garofalo, and Sheila, played by ""Home Improvement""'s Patricia Richardson, are stellar additions, as are most of the lesser new characters in the two campaigns.  Even Harper, my least favourite title character, started to grow on me as the season wore on.Overall: a very strong season.  There are no shows on the level of ""The Supremes"", ""Posse Comitatus"", or ""In the Shadow of Two Gunmen"" but the episodes are mostly strong and it's certainly a better season overall than either 5 or 6.",4,A fitting end to a stellar series,1184976000,"07 21, 2007",2007,3186,"['long', 'denouement', 'West', 'Wing', 'essentially', 'started', 'creator', 'Sorkin', 'departure', 'end', 'Season', '4', 'up', '7th', 'season', 'have', 'election', 'transfer', 'power', 'new', 'administration', 'departure', 'many', 'beloved', 'characters', 'White', 'House', 'last', 'time', 'way', 'have', 'nifty', 'inside', 'what', 'run', 'campaign', 'country', 'what', 'West', 'Wing', 'best', 'stories', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'compelling', 'were', 'earlier', 'years', 'soap', 'opera', 'creep', 'show', 'can', 'forgive', 'show', 'still', 'better', 'written', 'other', 'TV.The', 'show', 'best', 'when', 'focussing', 'lower-level', 'characters', 'not', 'say', 'bigwigs', 'are', ""n't"", 'well', 'played', 'Jimmy', 'Smits', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'here', 'was', 'NYC', 'cop', 'Law', 'Order', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'see', 'debates', 'interactions', 'bigwigs', 'real', 'life', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'are', 'spin-doctors', 'lawyers', 'junior', 'staffers', 'policies', 'talking', 'heads', 'Originally', 'Sorkin', 'vision', 'was', 'focus', 'solely', 'likes', 'Josh', 'Sam', 'Donna', 'etc.', 'best', 'shows', 'season', 'are', 'when', 'characters', 'come', 'fore', 'learn', 'inside', 'workings', 'national', 'campaign', 'vital', 'importance', 'are', 'two', 'spin-doctors', 'Republican', 'Bruno', 'Democrat', 'Louise', 'pollster', 'Joey', 'Lucas', 'are', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'episode', 'are', 'also', 'guts', 'campaigns', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'work.So', 'individual', 'work', 'what', 'season', 'whole', 'mentioned', 'unfortunate', 'tendency', 'episodes', 'senitmentality', 'fewer', '5', '11', 'title', 'characters', 'who', 'were', 'previously', 'single', 'end', 'up', 'relationships', 'end', 'season', 'think', 'more', 'rest', 'series', 'combined', 'had', '3', 'notable', 'realtionships', 'involving', 'main', 'characters', 'Josh/Amy', 'Sam/Mallory', 'Charlie/Zoey', 'somewhat', 'counteracted', 'reappearance', 'especially', 'John', 'Spencer/Leo', 'McGarry', 'funeral', 'many', 'forgotten', 'characters', 'Mallory', 'three', 'Bartlet', 'daughters', 'Sam', 'Joey', 'Lucas', 'Special', 'Agent', 'Butterfield', 'Danny', 'Concannon', 'Amy', 'Bruno', 'even', 'Emily', 'Procter', 'returns', 'CSI', 'Miami', 'reprise', 'role', 'Ainsley', 'one', 'season', 'extended', 'finale', 'series', 'whole', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'original', 'main', 'characters', 'especially', 'non-title', 'screen', 'characters', 'Ginger', 'Ed', 'Larry', 'Nancy', 'McNally', 'Debbie', 'played', 'always', 'entertaining', 'Lily', 'Tomlin', 'do', 'new', 'characters', 'Louise', 'played', 'Janeane', 'Garofalo', 'Sheila', 'played', 'Home', 'Improvement', 'Patricia', 'Richardson', 'are', 'stellar', 'additions', 'are', 'most', 'lesser', 'new', 'characters', 'two', 'campaigns', 'Even', 'Harper', 'least', 'favourite', 'title', 'character', 'started', 'grow', 'season', 'wore', 'on.Overall', 'very', 'strong', 'season', 'are', 'shows', 'level', 'Supremes', 'Posse', 'Comitatus', 'Shadow', 'Two', 'Gunmen', 'episodes', 'are', 'mostly', 'strong', 'certainly', 'better', 'season', 'overall', '5', '6']",WEST WING: COMPLETE SEVENTH SEASON (WS)

I, like so many, had given up on The West Wing when Aaron Sorkin left, wished the show cancelled during its atrocious 5th season, and, honestly, found the show an irritating fantasy during the Sorkin-helmed 4th season anyway.  Something astonishing happens during ""The Ticket,"" the season's first episode - you feel, in its incredible pacing, structure, and emotional understatement - that Aaron Sorkin has not only returned but has regained all of his abilities as a writer.  That he is not at all involved with the show means that writers like Eli Attie and Deborah Cahn have finally gotten their work as writers to both revive the lightning-quick trademarks of The West Wing while also justifying the often-unswallowable plot maneuvers of its previous two seasons.  It occurred to me during ""Message of the Week,"" a nimble and thrilling episode, that campaign-trail politics had never been so accurately represented, if they'd truly ever been attempted at all.  That means The West Wing had found a reason to exist again, and that sense invigorated all the stories it surrounded - the White House's ""leak"" story, or the regional conflict between Kazhakstan and China.  And, in a winning surprise, it also revived its still extraordinary cast - Bradley Whitford especially turns the stress of campaigning into a frayed study of stress and exhaustion, and with Janeane Garofalo at his side, he finds a sparring partner of incredible energy.  The two's chemistry makes the workplace seem as vital a beast as this White House ever seemed in its prime.",5,What a send-off!,1155340800,"08 12, 2006",2006,1657,"['wouuld', 'be', 'difficult', 'truly', 'describe', 'wonderful', 'shock', 'West', 'Wing', 'final', 'season', 'so', 'many', 'had', 'given', 'up', 'West', 'Wing', 'when', 'Aaron', 'Sorkin', 'left', 'wished', 'show', 'cancelled', 'atrocious', '5th', 'season', 'honestly', 'found', 'show', 'irritating', 'fantasy', 'Sorkin-helmed', '4th', 'season', 'anyway', 'Something', 'astonishing', 'happens', 'Ticket', 'season', 'first', 'episode', 'feel', 'incredible', 'pacing', 'structure', 'emotional', 'understatement', 'Aaron', 'Sorkin', 'not', 'only', 'returned', 'regained', 'abilities', 'writer', 'not', 'involved', 'show', 'writers', 'Eli', 'Attie', 'Deborah', 'Cahn', 'have', 'finally', 'gotten', 'work', 'writers', 'revive', 'lightning-quick', 'trademarks', 'West', 'Wing', 'also', 'justifying', 'often-unswallowable', 'plot', 'maneuvers', 'previous', 'two', 'seasons', 'occurred', 'Message', 'Week', 'nimble', 'thrilling', 'episode', 'campaign-trail', 'politics', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'so', 'accurately', 'represented', ""'d"", 'truly', 'ever', 'been', 'attempted', 'West', 'Wing', 'had', 'found', 'reason', 'exist', 'again', 'sense', 'invigorated', 'stories', 'surrounded', 'White', 'House', 'leak', 'story', 'regional', 'conflict', 'Kazhakstan', 'China', 'winning', 'surprise', 'also', 'revived', 'still', 'extraordinary', 'cast', 'Bradley', 'Whitford', 'especially', 'stress', 'campaigning', 'frayed', 'study', 'stress', 'exhaustion', 'Janeane', 'Garofalo', 'side', 'sparring', 'partner', 'incredible', 'energy', 'two', 'chemistry', 'workplace', 'seem', 'vital', 'beast', 'White', 'House', 'ever', 'seemed', 'prime']",WEST WING: COMPLETE SEVENTH SEASON (WS)

It comes from that philosophy that politicians ""do the right thing"", and political operatives put aside their personal differences and do what's best for the country.  It doesn't happen that way, it never has, and, sadly, probably never will.  This season had a couple of unbelievable occurences, like Alan Alda's portrayal of a Republican pro-choice (!) candidate.  The GOP would never run a pro-choice candidate, ever.  Even the addition of the politically aware Janeane Garofalo didn't save this show.  Now, if they had let the cynical, acerbic Garofalo write some episodes, that would have been interesting.  Janeane actually knows more about politics than most of the pundits (and probably the writers of this show) combined.  I do agree that a tribute to John Spencer should have been included.

1011839,A36EW68H08UOCS,B000HC2LHQ,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[84, 86]","Alan Alda must feel blessed to have been such an integral part of two of the greatest shows in television history.  The creative forces behind the West Wing gathered their collective strengths and gave the series the ending it deserved.  Decades from now I'll be pulling out these discs and watching them.With horror and sadness we learned last December that John Spencer had suddenly passed.  West Wing fans grieved and sent their prayers on behalf of Mr. Spencer and those who had actually known and loved him.  We can see that some of that love and respect gets translated to the show and the episodes that swirl around Leo's death are among the most heart-breaking I've ever seen on screen.  When Kristin Chenoweth as Annabeth tells Bradley Whitford as Josh that Leo has died her tears didn't look at all like ""acting"". The same can be said for the expressions on the faces of all of the actors at Leo's funeral, ending with Martin Sheen as President Bartlet.The storyline of this season centers on the Presidential race with Jimmy Smits portraying Congressman Matt Santos against Alda's Senator Arnold Vinick.  This ticket was clearly the fantasy of the liberal writers as even the Republican candidate is pro-choice, insults some NRA-type vigilantes and all but thumbs his nose at the religious right.  As Vinick's campaign is derailed somewhat in the aftermath of a nuclear accident in California a particularly shrewish right-winger is brought in to help the Senator woo back the republican base.  Ron Silver continues in his role as Bruno Gianelli, the political strategist who only cares about winning - and knows how to do it.  Patricia Richardson is effective as Vinick's assistant who tries to keep him on track.  Janeane Garofalo serves as sparring partner to Josh as Lou, a democratic operative who gets almost as much pleasure from seeing Josh flounder (which he inevitably does for brief moments) as from helping her political causes.  Teri Polo plays Helen - candidate Santos' wife - and this character always seems a little less enthusiastic than would be appropriate for the wife of a man who may become president.Aside from the sensitive and respectful way the real-life death of John Spencer was worked into the fictional story, this season gets a few other things right.  Where we may have been frustrated in the past at the lack of love lives of most of these characters for years - all in the service of their country - this season we get to see most of the principal characters hook up in one way or another.  First daughter Ellie gets married in a White House ceremony curiously missing both of her sisters. (Although all three daughters make Leo's funeral.) Through their own obvious attraction and Donna's persistence Josh and Donna finally get together.  In the opening of the first episode we're glad to see in flashback that C.J. and Danny Concannon have married and have a child, and in other episodes we get to see Danny's gentle courting techniques on one of the most powerful (and powerfully nice) women in the world.  It's also gratifying to see some ""old friends"" show up in the final episodes such as Rob Lowe's return as Sam Seaborn.  (Sam is recruited to duty by Josh in a scene that pays homage to the earlier flashback scene from season two when Josh conscripts Sam to the first ""Bartlet for America"" campaign.)To the shows writers, directors, actors, and the professionals who shot, set and costumed the show: Bravo! I'll miss you dearly and watch these shows with enduring pleasure.To the pinheads who decided to release these DVDs without any significant extras: A pox on your houses.  While the first seasons came with full sets of subtitles, documentaries and commentary tracks in which performers, directors and creators couldn't withhold their obvious glee - this season comes with next to nothing.  The first seasons came with subtitles in English, Francais and Espanol.  The last two seasons have not had an option for English subtitles.  What if the viewer is hard of hearing?What is the reason for these deficiencies? Laziness? Complacency? No doubt the almighty dollar played the major role.  This show - and this show's fans - deserved better.Rest in well-deserved and honored peace, John Spencer.

And while a real presidential race is only a few months, this takes almost the entire season.Now, this is told from the Democratic point of view but it is obvious that Alan Alda has more charisma as an actor than Jimmy Smits.  So therefore, most views (an the TV academy) are rooting for Vinnick. Therefore, the producers and authors have to create a nuclear accident for Santos to squeak by Vinnick at the election.To complicate things is a real tragedy.  Last December actor John Spencer suddenly died.  This meant that, the season only two thirds shot, a main character has to disappear.  They handle this well until after the Leo's death is announced on election night.  Then they turn this into a series of dramas that do not play well.Further more, by this time NBC had already made the decision to cancel the show.  So, why not be realistic and let the show come to a natural ending and not this overblown and contrived ending.The final episodes reunite many of the ongoing semi regulars.

Or you're going to have people in your face, forcing you to do penance for ""questionable tastes"". And they won't let up on you until they've made you crawl; ""You like THAT $#@&? What's WRONG with you?"" One friend of mine told me; ""That show should have aired on the Hallmark Network with all the other goody-goody #$%@"", which as a critique was a bit better than usual. But this series depicted a Democratic President who wasn't really one of those lefties who loves criminals and America's enemies--he served real, decent Americans. Kind of an avuncular version of Bill Clinton, who I voted for both times, even though the second time through I'd switched to the Republican party. We got to see the absolutely right man to play Jed Bartlet in Martin Sheen. We got to see Alan Alda play a serious role. We even got to see John Goodman play a straight role, when he didn't have Alda's advantage of normally playing witty roles. Goodman is ""slob comedy"" in the true Steve Martin/ Jim Carrey tradition, but he nailed it. And we got to see a developing romance between Josh and Donna, two nice types who any lover would not hesitate to take home to meet Mama. I mean, usually TV or movie romances have ""moved on"" from the Cary Grant/ Deborah Kerr mold to a more ""sophisticated"" (which is to say ""slightly tawdry, tempered by a bit of class"") model. Josh and Donna were a what-if: what if soaps had good people rather than the decadent mean-sprited dreamboats they have now. I mean, when those two were on, the President Of the United States played a supporting role. I rooted for them week after week, and when Donna landed the job working for the new First Lady, taking her out of Josh's chain of command, legitimizing their romance, I went; ""YESSS!!"" like I'd been watching a sports event and there had just been a dazzling play. And dirty politics. There have always been dirty politics. Aaron Sorkin didn't build a never never land of naive decency--the dirty politics were there but they didn't rule Washington the way all the haters on the internet posts would have you believe.

1011867,A2RDR5G65D9H84,B000HC2LHQ,Sebastian Fernandez,"[0, 0]","The creators of this show decided to end the series with a thunder, and therefore delivered a season that has it all. There are clear parallelisms between some of the situation seen in the show and those faced by the current administration, and the criticism could not be clearer. There are many comments regarding ""Stay the course"", and even though it is based on a different environment, the message comes through loud and clear, and with a good level of sarcasm. Also, talking about the inexistence of an exit strategy for a war that the US may march into should ring some bells.We are used from previous seasons to see a team in the White House that is trying to govern in an ethical way, but instead of facing an ""ideal situation"" to do so, has to compromise and do things little by little. This is still true, but the main focus of this season is on the race for the presidency between Matt Santos and Arnold Vinick. This makes for some exciting episodes and the fact that Vinick is not a typical Republican leads to some very interesting situations. I bet many people wish that the debates we get to see in real life were as good and revealing as the one we witness during this season.Then there is the romance. If you are one of those that during the previous seasons was always waiting for relationships to develop between some of the characters, and saw that it was not happening, you will now have your redemption. I understand why the writers crafted it this way, since too much romance in the past would have take focus away from the main issues, but now they really went all out and made good in their unpaid debts.The usual cast does an outstanding job, but Jimmy Smits and Alan Alda are so amazingly good in their roles that they place themselves a step above the rest. It will be hard to see these actors in other roles in the future without thinking of them as the president candidates Santos and Vinick. I also liked the idea of bringing in Janeane Garofalo, an actress that is known for her strong political activism and that plays the role displaying that passion.Of course, I cannot write a review about this series without mentioning John Spencer and his untimely death. This actor was the heart and soul of the show and the fact that he played a character that shares many characteristics with his real persona is not a minor detail. The episode ""Requiem"" is one in which you can feel that some of the members are not acting at all, but showing their true emotions and appreciation for Spencer instead. The creators of the series did a good job in modifying the script to deal with the unexpected event, and should be praised for this.The quality and success of this show through its seven years has set the bar extremely high for any future political series. And the reasons behind this are clear as water. I hope someone in the future can come even close to this altitude, but I am not holding my breath, since the odds of that happening are not too good!",5,"""It's ridiculous to suggest that we would ever have to go to war to assure our oil supply""",1195344000,"11 18, 2007",2007,2981,"['creators', 'show', 'decided', 'end', 'series', 'thunder', 'therefore', 'delivered', 'season', 'are', 'clear', 'parallelisms', 'situation', 'seen', 'show', 'faced', 'current', 'administration', 'criticism', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'clearer', 'are', 'many', 'comments', 'regarding', 'Stay', 'course', 'even', 'based', 'different', 'environment', 'message', 'loud', 'clear', 'good', 'level', 'sarcasm', 'Also', 'talking', 'inexistence', 'exit', 'strategy', 'war', 'US', 'may', 'march', 'should', 'ring', 'bells.We', 'are', 'used', 'previous', 'seasons', 'see', 'team', 'White', 'House', 'trying', 'govern', 'ethical', 'way', 'instead', 'facing', 'ideal', 'situation', 'do', 'so', 'compromise', 'do', 'things', 'little', 'little', 'still', 'true', 'main', 'focus', 'season', 'race', 'presidency', 'Matt', 'Santos', 'Arnold', 'Vinick', 'exciting', 'episodes', 'fact', 'Vinick', 'not', 'typical', 'Republican', 'very', 'interesting', 'situations', 'bet', 'many', 'people', 'wish', 'debates', 'get', 'see', 'real', 'life', 'were', 'as', 'good', 'revealing', 'one', 'witness', 'season.Then', 'romance', 'are', 'one', 'previous', 'seasons', 'was', 'always', 'waiting', 'relationships', 'develop', 'characters', 'saw', 'was', 'not', 'happening', 'will', 'now', 'have', 'redemption', 'understand', 'why', 'writers', 'crafted', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'romance', 'past', 'would', 'have', 'take', 'focus', 'away', 'main', 'issues', 'now', 'really', 'went', 'made', 'good', 'unpaid', 'debts.The', 'usual', 'cast', 'outstanding', 'job', 'Jimmy', 'Smits', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'are', 'so', 'amazingly', 'good', 'roles', 'place', 'step', 'rest', 'will', 'be', 'hard', 'see', 'actors', 'other', 'roles', 'future', 'thinking', 'president', 'candidates', 'Santos', 'Vinick', 'also', 'liked', 'idea', 'bringing', 'Janeane', 'Garofalo', 'actress', 'known', 'strong', 'political', 'activism', 'role', 'displaying', 'passion.Of', 'course', 'can', 'not', 'write', 'review', 'series', 'mentioning', 'John', 'Spencer', 'untimely', 'death', 'actor', 'was', 'heart', 'soul', 'show', 'fact', 'played', 'character', 'shares', 'many', 'characteristics', 'real', 'persona', 'not', 'minor', 'detail', 'episode', 'Requiem', 'one', 'can', 'feel', 'members', 'are', 'not', 'acting', 'showing', 'true', 'emotions', 'appreciation', 'Spencer', 'instead', 'creators', 'series', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'modifying', 'script', 'deal', 'unexpected', 'event', 'should', 'be', 'praised', 'this.The', 'quality', 'success', 'show', 'seven', 'years', 'set', 'bar', 'extremely', 'high', 'future', 'political', 'series', 'reasons', 'are', 'clear', 'water', 'hope', 'someone', 'future', 'can', 'come', 'even', 'close', 'altitude', 'am', 'not', 'holding', 'breath', 'odds', 'happening', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'good']",WEST WING: COMPLETE SEVENTH SEASON (WS)

EITHER 1) Watch all 7 seasons of the series, or 2) Watch the first 4 seasons, and then stop the final episode of the 4th season with about 1-3 minutes to go so you'll miss the cliffhanger.  I would highly recommend only watching the first 4 seasons.  However, if you insist on watching past the 4th season, then be prepared because there is a huge drop off in quality.  The creator and writer Aaron Sorkin was fired after the 4th season.  Season 5 was horrible, and season 6 was better, but a shadow of the shows former self.  Season 7 could never be as good as the first 4 seasons.  That said, it was so dramatically better than season 5, and a lot better than season 6.  It was, if you will, a nice gift to the fans that stuck through the bad years, and which let the show exit on a positive note.  This season still ranks #5 out of 7 seasons, but like I said, if you had to live through seasons 5 and 6, it was a nice reward.That's not to say the season didn't have its faults.  First, like I said, it wasn't as good as the first 4 seasons, so don't expect THAT much.  Second, it seemed as though they (writers, producers, network, you name it) were attempting to create the possibility of spinning the show off with a new President and cast.  The ratings weren't good enough, so they stopped trying to spin it of and focused on concluding the season.  Third, this season was almost 2 different shows - 1 with the former administration and 1 with the two competing candidates for president.  At times, the show would focus exclusively for an episode on either the campaign or what was going on at the White House.  That's easier to deal with on DVD, but was frustrating during the live season.Finally, I don't want to spoil anything, so don't read on if you don't want a spoiler.Ok, you've been warned.  Finally, one of the cast members passed away suddenly during the season.  I won't say who, but I will say that they had a very moving episode which both continued the story lines while paying homage to their fallen friend.  In the end, the show went out in a good way, and Season 7 was a nice reward for those who suffered through Season 5, and lived through season 6.  Like I said at the start, you might want to stop watching after season 4, but if you insist on plowing through past season 4, then this is a must own.",4,A nice finish to what used to be a Great Series,1167868800,"01 4, 2007",2007,2407,"['never', 'have', 'seen', 'show', 'then', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'routes', 'can', 'take', 'EITHER', '1', 'Watch', '7', 'seasons', 'series', '2', 'Watch', 'first', '4', 'seasons', 'then', 'stop', 'final', 'episode', '4th', 'season', '1-3', 'minutes', 'go', 'so', ""'ll"", 'miss', 'cliffhanger', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'only', 'watching', 'first', '4', 'seasons', 'However', 'insist', 'watching', '4th', 'season', 'then', 'be', 'prepared', 'huge', 'drop', 'quality', 'creator', 'writer', 'Aaron', 'Sorkin', 'was', 'fired', '4th', 'season', 'Season', '5', 'was', 'horrible', 'season', '6', 'was', 'better', 'shadow', 'shows', 'former', 'self', 'Season', '7', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'first', '4', 'seasons', 'said', 'was', 'so', 'dramatically', 'better', 'season', '5', 'lot', 'better', 'season', '6', 'was', 'will', 'nice', 'gift', 'fans', 'stuck', 'bad', 'years', 'let', 'show', 'exit', 'positive', 'note', 'season', 'still', '5', '7', 'seasons', 'said', 'had', 'live', 'seasons', '5', '6', 'was', 'nice', 'reward.That', 'not', 'say', 'season', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'faults', 'First', 'said', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'first', '4', 'seasons', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'THAT', 'much', 'Second', 'seemed', 'writers', 'producers', 'network', 'name', 'were', 'attempting', 'create', 'possibility', 'spinning', 'show', 'off', 'new', 'President', 'cast', 'ratings', 'were', ""n't"", 'good', 'enough', 'stopped', 'trying', 'spin', 'focused', 'concluding', 'season', 'Third', 'season', 'was', 'almost', '2', 'different', 'shows', '1', 'former', 'administration', '1', 'two', 'competing', 'candidates', 'president', 'times', 'show', 'would', 'focus', 'exclusively', 'episode', 'campaign', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'White', 'House', 'easier', 'deal', 'DVD', 'was', 'frustrating', 'live', 'season.Finally', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'anything', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'read', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoiler.Ok', ""'ve"", 'been', 'warned', 'Finally', 'one', 'cast', 'members', 'passed', 'away', 'suddenly', 'season', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'who', 'will', 'say', 'had', 'very', 'moving', 'episode', 'continued', 'story', 'lines', 'paying', 'homage', 'fallen', 'friend', 'end', 'show', 'went', 'out', 'good', 'way', 'Season', '7', 'was', 'nice', 'reward', 'who', 'suffered', 'Season', '5', 'lived', 'season', '6', 'said', 'start', 'might', 'want', 'stop', 'watching', 'season', '4', 'insist', 'plowing', 'past', 'season', '4', 'then', 'must', 'own']",WEST WING: COMPLETE SEVENTH SEASON (WS)

Season Seven has us following the presidential campaign and the last year of president Bartlett in the White House. This seems to have upped it's game since the last series and although it still lacks the spark of earlier series, it still offers up political intrigue and drama in spades. This series has a live broadcast episode, which happens to be the Presidential debate and it makes for gripping viewing. You almost feel as if it is real and the live element adds to the tension and power of this particular episode. There is also an episode written by Bradley Whitford, who is the actor who plays Josh, and this is pretty good. This series looks at the aforementioned presidential campaign, as well as the genocide in Sudan, a oil conflict in Kazakhstan, a nuclear power plant crisis in America, a top security leak at the White House and the transition from one administration to the next and the resolution to this long running political series. Sadly John Spencer died during the filming of this series and he is honoured here by Martin Sheen The scriptwriters also managed to write this into the story with sensitivity, whilst being credible to the series, in fact Leo McGarry`s funeral is used as an end of season roll call of all the previous actors who have been in the series` and is a nice way to revisit past characters. This manages to tie things up neatly and still leaves things feeling fresh and full of hope. It is emotional, but not over sentimental and you will finish the series with a sense of satisfaction and a tinge of sadness at it's ending. This is an exceptional political drama and lived up to it's high standards right to the end.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.",4,West Wing 7,1294876800,"01 13, 2011",2011,1830,"['so', 'have', 'reached', 'end', 'Bartlett', 'Administration', 'saga', 'end', 'West', 'Wing', 'Season', 'Seven', 'following', 'presidential', 'campaign', 'last', 'year', 'president', 'Bartlett', 'White', 'House', 'have', 'upped', 'game', 'last', 'series', 'still', 'spark', 'earlier', 'series', 'still', 'up', 'political', 'intrigue', 'drama', 'spades', 'series', 'live', 'broadcast', 'episode', 'be', 'Presidential', 'debate', 'gripping', 'viewing', 'almost', 'feel', 'real', 'live', 'element', 'tension', 'power', 'particular', 'episode', 'also', 'episode', 'written', 'Bradley', 'Whitford', 'who', 'actor', 'who', 'Josh', 'pretty', 'good', 'series', 'aforementioned', 'presidential', 'campaign', 'as', 'well', 'genocide', 'Sudan', 'oil', 'conflict', 'Kazakhstan', 'nuclear', 'power', 'plant', 'crisis', 'America', 'top', 'security', 'leak', 'White', 'House', 'transition', 'one', 'administration', 'next', 'resolution', 'long', 'running', 'political', 'series', 'Sadly', 'John', 'Spencer', 'died', 'filming', 'series', 'honoured', 'here', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'scriptwriters', 'also', 'managed', 'write', 'story', 'sensitivity', 'whilst', 'being', 'credible', 'series', 'fact', 'Leo', 'McGarry', 's', 'funeral', 'used', 'end', 'season', 'roll', 'call', 'previous', 'actors', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'series', 'nice', 'way', 'revisit', 'past', 'characters', 'tie', 'things', 'up', 'neatly', 'still', 'things', 'feeling', 'fresh', 'full', 'hope', 'emotional', 'not', 'sentimental', 'will', 'finish', 'series', 'sense', 'satisfaction', 'tinge', 'sadness', 'ending', 'exceptional', 'political', 'drama', 'lived', 'up', 'high', 'standards', 'right', 'end.Feel', 'free', 'check', 'out', 'blog', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'profile', 'page']",WEST WING: COMPLETE SEVENTH SEASON (WS)

However, I was intensely disappointed with the final season.  I thought the prospect of a season-long presidential campaign with brand new characters would be amazing, but it was not nearly as good as it could have been.  I hated the much-hyped debate episode, and found the two candidates to leave a lot to be desired.However, I will say that the convention episode is one of the greatest from the entire series.

That season was so dreadful, that I will probably not watch the DVDs even though I own them.The sixth season showed much improvement with the addition of Alan Alda and Jimmy Smits, and the return of intricate plotting and literate, sparkling dialogue.  This last season, as others have mentioned, was nearly as good as the Sorkin years.  Gritty, finely-tuned plotting,risk-taking with such episodes as the Debate, (originally broadcast live), and the appropriate final developments in characters and plot.Instead of thinking this show had overstayed its welcome, I found myself wishing that there would be another season. Bringing back the Rob Lowe (Sam Seaborn) character was a classy touch; I only wish there had been more scenes with him.

The time it took to write the debate, gage reaction, and say almost nothing for an hour is truly our political system.They argued about everything, made no definitive decision about anything while asking you to trust them.  The acting was great!!!Who won the debate? --Lets see one candidate said I am going to do something but I need more money.  The other candidate said I am not going to do anything so I am going to give some of the money back.  Both tried to stay true to their narrow minded parties, but found it difficult because their parties were too constricting.Neither candidate could say what they were going to do, because they never read the executive powers of the United States??, but they both knew everything else about government, like what type of joke Abraham Lincoln told before he was shot.Hire me, to be your CEO of your electric company, I know how the light switch works but I don't know anything about electricity- Trust Me.My favorite part was CAFTA only works if the government is going to physically protect American jobs, which they said they would but didn't.  oops!!Great Show!!",5,the Debate,1374278400,"07 20, 2013",2013,1213,"['Debate', 'was', 'one', 'series', 'better', 'shows', 'was', 'just', 'real', 'debates', 'time', 'took', 'write', 'debate', 'gage', 'reaction', 'say', 'almost', 'nothing', 'hour', 'truly', 'political', 'system.They', 'argued', 'everything', 'made', 'definitive', 'decision', 'anything', 'asking', 'trust', 'acting', 'was', 'great', 'Who', 'won', 'debate', 'see', 'one', 'candidate', 'said', 'am', 'going', 'do', 'something', 'need', 'more', 'money', 'other', 'candidate', 'said', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'do', 'anything', 'so', 'am', 'going', 'give', 'money', 'back', 'tried', 'stay', 'true', 'narrow', 'minded', 'parties', 'found', 'difficult', 'parties', 'were', 'too', 'constricting.Neither', 'candidate', 'could', 'say', 'what', 'were', 'going', 'do', 'never', 'read', 'executive', 'powers', 'United', 'States', 'knew', 'everything', 'else', 'government', 'what', 'type', 'joke', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'told', 'was', 'shot.Hire', 'be', 'CEO', 'electric', 'company', 'know', 'how', 'light', 'switch', 'works', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'electricity-', 'Trust', 'Me.My', 'favorite', 'part', 'was', 'CAFTA', 'only', 'government', 'going', 'physically', 'protect', 'American', 'jobs', 'said', 'would', 'did', ""n't"", 'oops', 'Great', 'Show']",WEST WING: COMPLETE SEVENTH SEASON (WS)
