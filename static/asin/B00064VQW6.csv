860637,A3SOV9HFM5H9T1,B00064VQW6,Bruce P. Barten,"[3, 4]","This package is up to date.  DVD is the current technology for great pictures and some extraordinary sound choices.  On my computer, I don't fool around with the Audio Set-Up menu; I just click play concert and hear it through my tiny polk-audio speakers.  I might not be hearing the bass guitar, but this package also has a CD disc with 13 songs that play for 58 minutes, so I might have an opportunity to put the CD in a good stereo system sometime and find out what the music is supposed to sound like.  Aimee Mann is the star of this show, and her voice is what I usually listen for, even when she plays bass guitar.The best music might be ""Way Back When,"" the song selected for the ""Behind the Scenes Footage"" showing the group on a tour bus or by the Brooklyn Bridge.  The words and tune by Aimee Mann sound familiar from the end of her ""Whatever"" CD in 1993, with a great line ""They'll shoot you down like you was Al Capone.""  The words took 42 lines in the original CD liner notes, so it took a long time to remember where I heard all this before.  Al Capone went to prison for tax evasion as I remember it, so I think shooting him down is greatly exaggerated, but with all the mob shows and untouchables on television, it must be easy to imagine him getting whacked.  ""Whatever"" 's version of that song had Randy Brion on trombone and Jon Brion on nine instruments and vocals, too much going on, compared to the rollicking piano part that sustains this version for three minutes of unrelated video shots, and makes it sound more lively than five people trying to play together on stage, though this might have two pianos playing at the end.  Scott Joplin probably could have played it by himself, but that was a hundred years ago.As the band says in the interview feature on the DVD, the set list is great for all Aimee Mann's concerts.  I like the choice of ""The Moth"" and ""Calling It Quits"" to start the show because the insecurity about what is going to happen during the show is burned by the theme ""The moth don't care if the flame is real cause moth and flame got a sweetheart deal.""  Most people who go to a concert expect to be there for the whole show, unless they want to leave before the parking lot fills up with drunk drivers.  Letting people know that Aimee already has a better idea for closing the show than ""Calling It Quits"" takes some of the pressure off early.  ""Sugarcoated"" is a great selection because I am still trying to figure out the words.  The CD notes for ""I'm with Stupid"" in 1995 had words listed individually in alphabetical order, so I found ""write wrong wrote"" when I was looking to see if the words were ""Whoever has it sugarcoated when they wrote it I would've believed it too.""  I needed to find lyrics on the internet to know that the second verse has ""Until the pencil stops.""  The song ""Long Shot"" is also one I hardly know because the words were in alphabetical order.  Some of the lines are so familiar, but if I don't hear the whole song often enough, I can't place them.  The greatest thing about modern technology is that it makes things so much easier for people who are trying to learn songs; in fact, what point could there be in trying to learn anything else?  People who have no interest in learning songs by Aimee Mann are at a terrible disadvantage when it comes to evaluating this DVD because why ?  What are they doing here ?She does not say as much during the concert, except for something funny about boxing, as during the interviews, which are staged in some quiet location but allow viewers to see the band in outfits that are more informal than what they wear onstage during the concert.  During the concert, ""Wise Up"" was called a song from the ""Magnolia"" soundtrack, but it was originally in the ""Jerry Maguire"" movie, and the ability of so many of the characters in ""Magnolia"" to sing along at a critical point in the movie depended on the wisdom of the song's line ""So just give up"" as a solution to a host of crazy problems.  Aimee Mann jokes about not having millions of fans in her interview, but there could be many people who would like to select only one song when they play a DVD, and the first page of song choices has the songs they ought to hear before they make the jump to the second half of the list.  ""Magnolia"" is a huge psychic implosion, which the song ""Save Me"" summarizes quite well after you watch the video on that DVD many times.  ""Stupid Thing"" forms a perfect transition to everything else because the concept is so versatile.The song ""Guys Like Me"" is played during the Slideshow on the DVD extra features, and the words are in the ""Lost in Space"" CD for those who haven't figured out why Aimee is singing ""put your money on the bona fide heavyweight and take it off guys like me.""""Deathly"" is a great song for the end of the concert and the end of the CD because its first line ""Now that I've met you . . ."" is sure to remind people of that line in the movie ""Magnolia"" and the ""No don't pick on me"" message that applies to lives going totally bonkers.  "" 'Cause I'm a goner and you haven't even begun.""  ""Just don't work your stuff . . .""  It is a song like fatal truths are true.",5,Watch this for three weeks at least,1107475200,"02 4, 2005",2005,5180,"['package', 'up', 'date', 'DVD', 'current', 'technology', 'great', 'pictures',

860638,A1XX5797TIZT5Q,B00064VQW6,D. Mok,"[20, 40]","How can a music DVD prohibit the use of the chapter-search function?Yes, folks...if you're playing a song and wish to jump to the next, you can't -- you have to go back to the main menu.  Who designed this DVD, an iDVD user with two days' experience!?  Or was this their way of saying, ""Watch the entire concert, or nothing""?  Moronic!This gross technical gaffe aside, the DVD has other issues.  Aimee Mann, all due respect to her songwriting abilities, is just not much of a live performer.  Her vocals are on-pitch and sound as good as on her record, but close your eyes and you could be listening to a studio recording.  And the visuals are professional enough, but just incredibly flat.  Mann tends to sing exclusively with her eyes closed, her only movements being a guitar-strumming right hand or gently swaying body (if that), which makes for dull viewing.  I thought she'd be more active on the songs where she plays bass, but not really.  But it's not entirely her.  Watch Queensryche's MTV Unplugged performance and you'll see an example of musicians and cameras working hand in hand to make a sit-down, acoustic-strumming performance highly engaging.  This camera and editing are just too content to stay flat, even -- flawless, but tasteless, as if afraid to hit bumps or make a wrong zoom.  That's just not the way to shoot a good live performance.  How about going closer than the medium shot once in a while?Mann's in-between song banter, on the other hand, is hilarious, as dry and sarcastic as many of her songs, and if she's a somewhat inactive performer, she also never appears less than comfortable.  But I still wish she could have given a fierier, more ragged, or in any way different performance so that it's all not so...blandly perfect.  And if you listen to every song on the setlist (mostly based on recent materials, with only two songs from Whatever) back to back, you'll also hear a problem in Mann's recent songwriting.  A good 80 per cent of the songs are midtempo ballads with few peaks, and given Mann's detached vocal style, this contributes to a feeling of sameness over the 16-song set.The live CD included in this double-disc package was recorded in the same venue.  I didn't quite do a track-by-track comparison with the DVD so I can't say if it's the exact same show in audio form; there is definitely overlap.  They're similar enough in performance and quality that if you like the DVD, you will like the live CD.  Me, I have the same problem with it as with Mann's music since Bachelor No. 2 -- not enough excitement, risk, and variety.  But if you're one of the multitude of fans who like her recent output -- especially Lost in Space -- you will probably like both the DVD and the CD.  Personally, I'm still waiting for Mann to rediscover her rock n' roll cojones...to advance the songs beyond 120 bpm once in a while.",3,"Somewhat flat, with a colossal blunder in the DVD design.",1099353600,"11 2, 2004",2004,2862,"['How', 'can', 'music', 'DVD', 'use', 'chapter-search', 'function', 'Yes', 'folks', ""'re"", 'playing', 'song', 'wish', 'jump', 'next', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'go', 'back', 'main', 'menu', 'Who', 'designed', 'DVD', 'iDVD', 'user', 'two', 'days', 'experience', 'was', 'way', 'saying', 'Watch', 'entire', 'concert', 'nothing', 'Moronic', 'gross', 'technical', 'gaffe', 'aside', 'DVD', 'other', 'issues', 'Aimee', 'Mann', 'due', 'respect', 'songwriting', 'abilities', 'just', 'not', 'much', 'live', 'performer', 'vocals', 'are', 'on-pitch', 'sound', 'as', 'good', 'record', 'close', 'eyes', 'could', 'be', 'listening', 'studio', 'recording', 'visuals', 'are', 'professional', 'enough', 'just', 'incredibly', 'flat', 'Mann', 'sing', 'exclusively', 'eyes', 'closed', 'only', 'movements', 'being', 'guitar-strumming', 'right', 'hand', 'gently', 'swaying', 'body', 'dull', 'viewing', 'thought', ""'d"", 'be', 'more', 'active', 'songs', 'where', 'bass', 'not', 'really', 'not', 'entirely', 'Watch', 'Queensryche', 'MTV', 'Unplugged', 'performance', ""'ll"", 'see', 'example', 'musicians', 'cameras', 'working', 'hand', 'hand', 'make', 'sit-down', 'acoustic-strumming', 'performance', 'highly', 'engaging', 'camera', 'editing', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'content', 'stay', 'flat', 'even', 'flawless', 'tasteless', 'afraid', 'hit', 'bumps', 'make', 'wrong', 'zoom', 'just', 'not', 'way', 'shoot', 'good', 'live', 'performance', 'How', 'going', 'closer', 'medium', 'shot', 'once', 'while', 'Mann', 'in-between', 'song', 'banter', 'other', 'hand', 'hilarious', 'dry', 'sarcastic', 'many', 'songs', 'somewhat', 'inactive', 'performer', 'also', 'never', 'less', 'comfortable', 'still', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'given', 'fierier', 'more', 'ragged', 'way', 'different', 'performance', 'not', 'so', 'blandly', 'perfect', 'listen', 'song', 'setlist', 'mostly', 'based', 'recent', 'materials', 'only', 'two', 'songs', 'back', 'back', ""'ll"", 'also', 'hear', 'problem', 'Mann', 'recent', 'songwriting', 'good', '80', 'cent', 'songs', 'are', 'midtempo', 'ballads', 'few', 'peaks', 'given', 'Mann', 'detached', 'vocal', 'style', 'feeling', 'sameness', '16-song', 'set.The', 'live', 'CD', 'included', 'double-disc', 'package', 'was', 'recorded', 'same', 'venue', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'do', 'track-by-track', 'comparison', 'DVD', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'exact', 'same', 'show', 'audio', 'form', 'definitely', 'overlap', ""'re"", 'similar', 'enough', 'performance', 'quality', 'like', 'DVD', 'will', 'like', 'live', 'CD', 'Me', 'have', 'same', 'problem', 'Mann', 'music', 'Bachelor', 'No', '2', 'not', 'enough', 'excitement', 'risk', 'variety', ""'re"", 'one', 'multitude', 'fans', 'who', 'recent', 'output', 'especially', 'Lost', 'Space', 'will', 'probably', 'DVD', 'CD', 'Personally', ""'m"", 'still', 'waiting', 'Mann', 'rediscover', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'cojones', 'advance', 'songs', '120', 'bpm', 'once', 'while']",N/A
860639,A1EAFFJQ2NDHGC,B00064VQW6,Eric J. Anderson,"[4, 6]","Aimee's first live CD/DVD project is a gift to fans who cannot attend one of her concerts, or who want to repeat their concert  experience. I believe Live at St. Anne's must accurately document what an Aimee Mann show is like on a good night. This set is a bargain -- for the price of a CD you get a live CD and a DVD you can enjoy any time.The word that keeps coming to mind when I think about the program is professional. Aimee's songs are superbly crafted, and her band gives them just due in these live arrangements. If there is any quality in which this DVD falls short, it would be that the performances are perhaps a bit too cautious at times. The two new songs (from an upcoming album to be titled King of the Jailhouse) sound a bit tired, treading the kind of musical and lyrical ground she has trod many times before, but the rest of the material was top notch.I think Aimee's studio recordings are superior to the versions here. Perhaps arranging the tunes in new and interesting ways, or evidence of more passion in the performances would have made this DVD a standout, worthy of a five star rating. But it was fun just to see Aimee live, and perhaps that alone justifies this live disc.I have a few other minor quibbles. Aimee's acoustic guitar sounds rather unimpressive and ordinary. Surely she can afford an instrument with more sustain and brilliance -- or perhaps it is poorly recorded. Also, her voice tends to be a bit nasal, and this quality is more evident on her live performances than on her studio CDs. There were a few video compression artifacts in this DVD transfer, but overall the picture is excellent (anamorphic widescreen). The sound is also superb. Listening on headphones, I found the stereo mix more detailed and up close, but depending on your audio gear, you might prefer the slightly more laid-back sound of the 5.1 multichannel mix. I don't have surround speakers, so I can't evaluate the ability of that track to create a credible illusion of a concert hall when reproduced as intended.  Also, if you try to pick out an individual song on the DVD menu, the edit points are poorly chosen, and you may find that the selection starts a little after the music begins and ends just a little before the last note dies away.There is a special interview feature where Aimee and her band engage in a little mutual admiration, and talk a bit about performing together and being on the road. Unless you are a big fan, skip it.Aimee seemed to be a little stiff in the beginning -- the first songs are very competently played, but I felt that she was a bit detached from the material. She gets more confident as she goes forward, and on Amateur, she proves herself a much better bass player than the guy she hired to do most of the bass work in the band. Aimee really loosens up and starts rocking out on Pavlov's Bell, and from then on she seemed fully invested in her performance.Praises are due her lead guitar player, who probably makes the most impassioned music of all the musicians in the band, although many of his solos seemed based on note-for-note copies of the studio versions. Still, they were well played.If you like Aimee Mann, there is no reason you would not enjoy this concert. On the other hand, if you have her studio recordings, I cannot honestly say you will be missing much  if you don't see this DVD. Aimee is a very talented songwriter and a skilled performer. It may be difficult for some of us, because of location, to see her perform live, but this disc affords us an excellent opportunity.I'm not a fan of Aimee's 'Til Tuesday material, but since she went solo, she's written an impressive collection of truly wonderful songs, usually about dysfunctional people and relationships. Each person will obviously have his or her favorites, but this DVD offers a good sample of her solo career (except for the new songs, which I thought were unimpressive). But do buy the studio recordings. That is where Aimee does her best work.",4,A fine record of an excellent performance,1109376000,"02 26, 2005",2005,3981,"['Aimee', 'first', 'live', 'CD/DVD', 'project', 'gift', 'fans', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'attend', 'one', 'concerts', 'who', 'want', 'repeat', 'concert', 'experience', 'believe', 'Live', 'St.', 'Anne', 'must', 'accurately', 'document', 'what', 'Aimee', 'Mann', 'show', 'good', 'night', 'set', 'bargain', 'price', 'CD', 'get', 'live', 'CD', 'DVD', 'can', 'enjoy', 'time.The', 'word', 'coming', 'mind', 'when', 'think', 'program', 'professional', 'Aimee', 'songs', 'are', 'superbly', 'crafted', 'band', 'just', 'due', 'live', 'arrangements', 'quality', 'DVD', 'short', 'would', 'be', 'performances', 'are', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'too', 'cautious', 'times', 'two', 'new', 'songs', 'upcoming', 'album', 'be', 'titled', 'King', 'Jailhouse', 'sound', 'bit', 'tired', 'treading', 'kind', 'musical', 'lyrical', 'ground', 'trod', 'many', 'times', 'rest', 'material', 'was', 'top', 'notch.I', 'think', 'Aimee', 'studio', 'recordings', 'are', 'superior', 'versions', 'here', 'Perhaps', 'arranging', 'tunes', 'new', 'interesting', 'ways', 'evidence', 'more', 'passion', 'performances', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'DVD', 'standout', 'worthy', 'five', 'star', 'rating', 'was', 'fun', 'just', 'see', 'Aimee', 'live', 'perhaps', 'alone', 'justifies', 'live', 'disc.I', 'have', 'few', 'other', 'minor', 'quibbles', 'Aimee', 'acoustic', 'guitar', 'rather', 'unimpressive', 'ordinary', 'Surely', 'can', 'afford', 'instrument', 'more', 'sustain', 'brilliance', 'perhaps', 'poorly', 'recorded', 'Also', 'voice', 'be', 'bit', 'nasal', 'quality', 'more', 'evident', 'live', 'performances', 'studio', 'CDs', 'were', 'few', 'video', 'compression', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'picture', 'excellent', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'sound', 'also', 'superb', 'Listening', 'headphones', 'found', 'stereo', 'mix', 'more', 'detailed', 'up', 'close', 'depending', 'audio', 'gear', 'might', 'prefer', 'slightly', 'more', 'laid-back', 'sound', '5.1', 'multichannel', 'mix', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'surround', 'speakers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'evaluate', 'ability', 'track', 'create', 'credible', 'illusion', 'concert', 'hall', 'when', 'reproduced', 'intended', 'Also', 'try', 'pick', 'out', 'individual', 'song', 'DVD', 'menu', 'edit', 'points', 'are', 'poorly', 'chosen', 'may', 'find', 'selection', 'little', 'music', 'just', 'little', 'last', 'note', 'dies', 'away.There', 'special', 'interview', 'feature', 'where', 'Aimee', 'band', 'engage', 'little', 'mutual', 'admiration', 'talk', 'bit', 'performing', 'together', 'being', 'road', 'are', 'big', 'fan', 'skip', 'it.Aimee', 'seemed', 'be', 'little', 'stiff', 'beginning', 'first', 'songs', 'are', 'very', 'competently', 'played', 'felt', 'was', 'bit', 'detached', 'material', 'more', 'confident', 'forward', 'Amateur', 'much', 'better', 'bass', 'player', 'guy', 'hired', 'do', 'most', 'bass', 'work', 'band', 'Aimee', 'really', 'up', 'starts', 'rocking', 'out', 'Pavlov', 'Bell', 'then', 'seemed', 'fully', 'invested', 'performance.Praises', 'are', 'due', 'lead', 'guitar', 'player', 'who', 'probably', 'most', 'impassioned', 'music', 'musicians', 'band', 'many', 'solos', 'seemed', 'based', 'note-for-note', 'copies', 'studio', 'versions', 'Still', 'were', 'well', 'played.If', 'Aimee', 'Mann', 'reason', 'would', 'not', 'enjoy', 'concert', 'other', 'hand', 'have', 'studio', 'recordings', 'can', 'not', 'honestly', 'say', 'will', 'be', 'missing', 'much', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'DVD', 'Aimee', 'very', 'talented', 'songwriter', 'skilled', 'performer', 'may', 'be', 'difficult', 'location', 'see', 'perform', 'live', 'disc', 'excellent', 'opportunity.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'Aimee', ""'Til"", 'Tuesday', 'material', 'went', 'solo', 'written', 'impressive', 'collection', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'songs', 'usually', 'dysfunctional', 'people', 'relationships', 'person', 'will', 'obviously', 'have', 'favorites', 'DVD', 'good', 'sample', 'solo', 'career', 'new', 'songs', 'thought', 'were', 'unimpressive', 'do', 'buy', 'studio', 'recordings', 'where', 'Aimee', 'best', 'work']",N/A

860641,A3KRZDWHU4AYQA,B00064VQW6,Hoppy Doppelrocket,"[10, 20]","First off, this set is a pretty good deal.  You get an 80-minute concert DVD (plus some interviews and backstage footage) and a 58-minute bonus cd recorded during the same week as the dvd.  If I were a complainer (like my frumpy fifth wife) I'd whine for another 20 minutes added to both discs.  I suppose if I were an even bigger complainer (like my last girlfriend or my Johnkerryvoting neighbors) I'd gripe about the song selection as there's hardly any old stuff and no 'til tuesday numbers.  However, I am not those complainers.This dvd-cd set is a fantastic bargain.  The sound quality is top notch and the performance is stellar as well.  The listener is treated to varied camera angles and I find the song selection rather appealing as I really enjoy Aimee Mann's more recent efforts (to include 'Magnolia') and the new songs (from an album perhaps due in early 2005) are terrific (particularly ""Going Through the Motions"" and ""King of the Jailhouse"").  The band is in great form and Mann's voice seems to hit all the right notes.

Therefore, when I saw this DVD/CD set in the record store, I was conflicted. After much deliberation, my love for Aimee's music trumped my distaste for live recordings, and I bought the set. I am pleased to report that this release is as articulate and pleasing as Aimee's studio recordings.The DVD isn't some slapped-together recording of a show; it is a beautifully photographed spectacle sure to please even Aimee mann's most discriminating fans. (There were NINE cameras used!) And, in my opinion, seeing Aimee beautifully pick her way through a stunning rendition of ""4th of July"" is reason enough to own the DVD.The CD is pretty exciting, too. Note that it is not a CD version of the DVD; the set list is very different. Sure, usual suspects (like ""Save Me"") appear on both the DVD and the CD, but overall, the listening experience is different but fulfilling nonetheless.I recommend this set to both hardcore and mild Aimee Mann fans. And the extras (especially the interviews) are pretty cool.(Note: I had the privilege of seeing Aimee Mann live two years ago and what a show! She packed a large venue in Chicago, and came back onstage for SEVEN encores. She was so floored by the crowd's response to her music that she said she could play all night, which would have pleased us all. As one of her enccores, Aimee even played an eerie version of ""Voices Carry"" after humorously pleading with the crowd not to make her play what she called ""that tired old song."" Well, the show was amazing, so if you ever have the opportunity to see Aimee live, do it. Her live show is a singular experience.",5,Sublime!,1100476800,"11 15, 2004",2004,1687,"['Honestly', 'love', 'Aimee', 'Mann', 'music', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'concert', 'DVDs', 'live', 'CDs', 'Therefore', 'when', 'saw', 'DVD/CD', 'set', 'record', 'store', 'was', 'conflicted', 'much', 'deliberation', 'love', 'Aimee', 'music', 'trumped', 'distaste', 'live', 'recordings', 'bought', 'set', 'am', 'pleased', 'report', 'release', 'articulate', 'pleasing', 'Aimee', 'studio', 'recordings.The', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'slapped-together', 'recording', 'show', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'spectacle', 'sure', 'please', 'even', 'Aimee', 'mann', 'most', 'discriminating', 'fans', 'were', 'NINE', 'cameras', 'used', 'opinion', 'seeing', 'Aimee', 'beautifully', 'pick', 'way', 'stunning', 'rendition', '4th', 'July', 'reason', 'enough', 'own', 'DVD.The', 'CD', 'pretty', 'exciting', 'too', 'Note', 'not', 'CD', 'version', 'DVD', 'set', 'list', 'very', 'different', 'Sure', 'usual', 'suspects', 'Save', 'Me', 'appear', 'DVD', 'CD', 'overall', 'listening', 'experience', 'different', 'fulfilling', 'nonetheless.I', 'recommend', 'set', 'hardcore', 'mild', 'Aimee', 'Mann', 'fans', 'extras', 'especially', 'interviews', 'are', 'pretty', 'cool', 'Note', 'had', 'privilege', 'seeing', 'Aimee', 'Mann', 'live', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'what', 'show', 'packed', 'large', 'venue', 'Chicago', 'came', 'back', 'onstage', 'SEVEN', 'encores', 'was', 'so', 'floored', 'crowd', 'response', 'music', 'said', 'could', 'play', 'night', 'would', 'have', 'pleased', 'one', 'enccores', 'Aimee', 'even', 'played', 'eerie', 'version', 'Voices', 'Carry', 'humorously', 'pleading', 'crowd', 'not', 'make', 'play', 'what', 'called', 'tired', 'old', 'song', 'Well', 'show', 'was', 'amazing', 'so', 'ever', 'have', 'opportunity', 'see', 'Aimee', 'live', 'do', 'live', 'show', 'singular', 'experience']",N/A
860643,A1OBJ2263JCK5,B00064VQW6,Kenneth M. Gelwasser,"[1, 1]","Right before singing a brand new song titled, ""King of the Jailhouse"", Aimee Mann introduces it by quipping, ""It's a real cheery-upper. A song, about bitterness, unhappiness and dysfunction...oh wait a minute, thats all my songs!"" Who would have known? On her first live DVD, Aimee Mann, the singer/songwriter of all those sad songs about dysfuntional lives and relationships, would reveal to her audience her wry wit and a great sense of humor. But thats what you get on her wonderful new concert DVD, ""Live at St. Ann's Warehouse"". Mann, along with her crack band gives us the tour of what I like to call Aimee-ville. A place, where there is always someone willing to ""blow town"" due to the bitter disapointments of life. Most of the songs are culled from her recent solo CDs ""Bachelor No.2"" & ""Lost in Space"", along with some of the tunes from the extraodinary film soundtract, ""Magnolia"". Aimee gives a first rate performance of these songs just investing so much emotion into her singing and playing. This DVD gives us great versions of songs like ""The Moth"", ""Fourth of July"", ""Red Vines"", ""Deathly"" and ""Save Me"". I paricularly love this version of ""Stupid Thing"". It's obvious that she really has formed a connection with both her bandmates and her audience. The DVD itself is really first class. Both the picture and the 5.1 surround sound are crystal clear. The extras include interviews with both the band and Aimee about such diverse subjects as life on tour and Aimee's previous fights with her former record company. I love one band member's comment about his enjoyment of playing the song set lists, where he responds ""no, It's not like I have to play ""American Pie"" every night."" That gave me a chuckle. The extras also include some interesting behind the scenes footage and a mini slide show. Along with the DVD there is also a seperate CD with a performance from another night. While the CD is well done and quite entertaining, if I had to pick between the two, I perfer the performnaces from the DVD. Either way this DVD/CD set is quite a bargain. Great shows!
