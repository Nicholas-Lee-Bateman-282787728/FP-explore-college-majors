Ready is a remake of a Teleugu film of the same name starring Ram and Genelia D'souza. This film is a vehicle for Salman Khan and his antics, and it is a both a tribute and testimony of his star power. The most preposterous things are executed randomly and you will love all of them.The basic story is about how Salman rescues a girl from the clutches of her evil fianc&eacute;'s family and manages to reunite a family of warring don's. Ready has one of the catchiest soundtracks of the year, you will want to hear 'Dhinka Chika', 'Character Dheela' and 'Meri Adaa' again and again.Don't listen to anyone of the critics; this is a film that you would love to watch again and again. 5 stars. 9/8/2011",5,A  Salman Khan show all the way,1316304000,"09 18, 2011",2011,793,"['Ready', 'one', 'films', 'brain', 'holiday', 'still', 'have', 'fun', 'Ready', 'remake', 'Teleugu', 'film', 'same', 'name', 'starring', 'Ram', 'Genelia', ""D'souza"", 'film', 'vehicle', 'Salman', 'Khan', 'antics', 'tribute', 'testimony', 'star', 'power', 'most', 'preposterous', 'things', 'are', 'executed', 'randomly', 'will', 'love', 'them.The', 'basic', 'story', 'how', 'Salman', 'girl', 'clutches', 'evil', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'family', 'manages', 'reunite', 'family', 'warring', 'don', 'Ready', 'one', 'catchiest', 'soundtracks', 'year', 'will', 'want', 'hear', ""'Dhinka"", 'Chika', ""'Character"", 'Dheela', 'Adaa', 'again', 'again.Do', ""n't"", 'listen', 'anyone', 'critics', 'film', 'would', 'love', 'watch', 'again', 'again', '5', 'stars', '9/8/2011']",Ready

Salman Khan is effortless in his role as Prem and he looked like he was having fun making this movie as there was a classic scene( plucked out of his other blockbuster movie) done tongue-in-cheek! All the songs were fabulous and absolutely addictive, especially Character Deela and Dinka Chika. The rest of the cast were great in their respective roles but I think this movie sells by the sheer force of Salman Khan's name alone,never mind his superb acting and charm! While I find this movie wasn't as great as DABANGG,which I think it's pretty hard to beat,it's still a very enjoyable and watchable movie and definitely worth adding to your collection. Some jokes could go over your head if you're not familiar with some past Bollywood movies or the Indian culture for that matter as I was with a particular scene, with Prem making reference to almond tea??? in context with his bride to his father - just couldn't get that one!

THis was the first movie i'd seen with salman as a more cheesy comedy type role and even this type of bollywood genre film and  i wasn't sure if i liked it the first time partly due to i missed things bc i was trying to read and watch it and bc i wasn't sure if i was supposed to take it seriously or not. Now that i've seen more of these kind of films i'm used to the humour and can appreciate how good this film really is! The songs are amazing and will be stuck in your head from day one!

1444144,A1P0GMUC7T1X6T,B0056L5T9A,travelguy uk,"[0, 0]","Have to say I was disappointed with this movie. Salman Khan is OK - he plays pretty much the same character in every movie. The story was weak, but then I suppose you don't expect Shakespeare. Where I was really disappointed was the over-reliance on body humor. Pelvic thrusts, urination, guys taking their shirts off. C'mon - if it's really funny material you don't have to reach for that. The songs were surprisingly poor as well. What was mildly interesting was the filming technique - not sure how they did it, but the DVD rendition has a surprisingly 3D feel to it, even on a 2D LCD with no glasses.

LIGHT AND FUNNY...EVENLY MATCHED CHARACTERS ....BRIDE TO BE IN WEDDING DRESS FLEEING FROM CEREMONY  WITH MAFIA STYLE FAMILY IN HOT PURSUIT ,PRETENDS SHE'S THE GIRL SALMAN CAME TO PICKUP AT THE AIRPORT TO GET AWAY FROM HER PURSUERS ....This is a fast paced ,outwit the enemy comedy ...trouble is who is your enemy..  The RUNAWAY Bride that was being forced to marry the mafia guy is wily and resourceful.  She overhears Salman at the airport saying that the woman from america that he has never seen before couldn't be what he needed because he needed a woman to be such and such. She utilizes that info to pretend to be his perfect marriage candidate. She yells his name and says her name is the one on the sign he's holding . She ask's where has he been, was he trying to ditch her and claim she wasn't there (what he was just planning to do ). HIS intended nasty tempered marriage candidate that was coming to visit for mutual inspection is still waiting at the airport .She came to India from the U.S. to attend a friends wedding and was going to inspect Salman as a side trip first. When no one shows up to meet her, she calls the house and the impostor answers and pretends it's a friend of hers and they can't possibly pick her up at the airport . This is a Bollywood believable entry theme for the set up of the swapped bride ... leaves plenty of time for the sparks to fly with the runaway brides character. The truth and attraction to be uncovered in some hilariously fun moments and just the right amount of fighting . Fun supporting cast with personality quirks. Good plot progression didn't seem slow or too long. The things he comes up with to get her out of her families clutches are witty, well written and entertaining.  Only seen about 6 Salman khan films so far but will be looking for some of his better stuff. I Like light hearted comedy and also action with a brain or mix of both and some light amount of slapstick...prefer sitcom. It had it and more.The plot has already been written out in great detail by the other reviewers. As always watch and judge for yourself. I bought this one off amazon and it was worth it. Feel free to spend some money. No flaws in the copy and it ran without a hitch. I MADE SURE TO PLAY IT OVER AND OVER TO MAKE SURE THE COPY DIDN'T HAVE PROBLEMS  .
