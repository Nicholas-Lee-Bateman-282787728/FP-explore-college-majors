361616,A3UT41TWD7N0D5,630316823X,AbeStreet,"[80, 82]","This film was made at a time when the big networks, in this case CBS, took pride in making tv movies and mini-series.  Excellent attention to detail in just about every aspect of this 3 part movie.  As the film moves from the 1920's to the 1940's and eventually the 1960's the viewer gets to see the town of Delano Georgia grow and change.  It almost seems as though Delano is a real town.  The costumes, settings and props for each time setting were well done.This mini-series stick very close to the original story written by Stuart Woods.  During a 40 year time frame 3 different police chiefs try to solve the various and ongoing murders that are taking place in the vicinity of Delano.  Young male transients are being kidnapped and sexually assaulted before they are murdered.  Racial tensions run high in Delano and add to the difficulty in solving the murders.  Good acting by all who participated.  Charlton Heston, Paul Sorvino, Brad Davis and Billy Dee Williams were at the top of their acting game in this mini-Series.I was able to tape the original 3 part mini-series when it was first aired and despite some drop in quality due to age this mini-series is a favorite of mine and viewed at least once a year.  For those who enjoyed the film they may want to read and or watch the story and film GRASS ROOTS.  This story continues to follow the Lee family as one of their members attempts to become a U.S. Senator.  During the race another racially motivated murder in Delano complicates matters.Lastly, this mini-series truely deserves to be released in DVD format.  I hope the DVD producers release the full 3 part 6 hour (with commercials) series and not the edited and scaled down VHS version that was released previously.",5,Great Book to Movie adaptation!!!,1076976000,"02 17, 2004",2004,1737,"['film', 'was', 'made', 'time', 'when', 'big', 'networks', 'case', 'CBS', 'took', 'pride', 'making', 'tv', 'movies', 'mini-series', 'Excellent', 'attention', 'detail', 'just', 'aspect', '3', 'part', 'movie', 'film', 'moves', '1920', '1940', 'eventually', '1960', 'viewer', 'see', 'town', 'Delano', 'Georgia', 'grow', 'change', 'almost', 'Delano', 'real', 'town', 'costumes', 'settings', 'props', 'time', 'setting', 'were', 'well', 'done.This', 'mini-series', 'stick', 'very', 'close', 'original', 'story', 'written', 'Stuart', 'Woods', '40', 'year', 'time', 'frame', '3', 'different', 'police', 'chiefs', 'try', 'solve', 'various', 'ongoing', 'murders', 'are', 'taking', 'place', 'vicinity', 'Delano', 'Young', 'male', 'transients', 'are', 'being', 'kidnapped', 'sexually', 'assaulted', 'are', 'murdered', 'Racial', 'tensions', 'run', 'high', 'Delano', 'add', 'difficulty', 'solving', 'murders', 'Good', 'acting', 'who', 'participated', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'Paul', 'Sorvino', 'Brad', 'Davis', 'Billy', 'Dee', 'Williams', 'were', 'top', 'acting', 'game', 'mini-Series.I', 'was', 'able', 'tape', 'original', '3', 'part', 'mini-series', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'aired', 'drop', 'quality', 'due', 'age', 'mini-series', 'favorite', 'mine', 'viewed', 'least', 'once', 'year', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'may', 'want', 'read', 'watch', 'story', 'film', 'GRASS', 'ROOTS', 'story', 'follow', 'Lee', 'family', 'one', 'members', 'attempts', 'become', 'U.S', 'Senator', 'race', 'racially', 'motivated', 'murder', 'Delano', 'complicates', 'matters.Lastly', 'mini-series', 'truely', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'format', 'hope', 'DVD', 'producers', 'release', 'full', '3', 'part', '6', 'hour', 'commercials', 'series', 'not', 'edited', 'scaled', 'down', 'VHS', 'version', 'was', 'released', 'previously']",N/A

The movie/mini-series ""Chiefs"" was so captivating that I simply couldn't pull myself away from the screen for all 200 minutes.  The story, the setting and the acting all just jelled together with timeless taste.One reviewer pointed out that this movie is proof that the major networks really knew how to put together made-for-tv productions at one time; I agree.  Everyone plays their role so convincingly and with such conviction that you never feel a dropoff in the many branches of the story.  Actually, every turn in the story brings out more curiousity from the viewer. I'd suggest making this movie a two night viewing, as I'd originally planned. But be careful, you might find yourself putting off all other plans in order to see the startling outcome of Chiefs.
