1603239,A39K9GDTIZ0933,B009YQJ33G,Braden Pickering,"[5, 7]","Having absolutely LOVED the ""Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters"" movie in the theater, I thought I'd check out this low budget knockoff, knowing full well in advance that it would probably be quite awful. But that's where things start to go awry, is the fact that it really isn't even the ""mockbluster"" it presents itself as, but rather a completely misleading and totally different kind of film altogether. The cover art would no doubt lead one to believe it's some sort of action-packed fantasy adventure, but the truth is it's more of an after school special geared towards teens and at the end of the day is just plain boring more than anything else. (They don't even wear the outifts they are pictured in, and there sure as heck ain't no castle!)I won't rehash the plot as many others here have done already, but suffice it to say that any connection to Hansel and Gretel, the fairy tale or otherwise, is stretched pretty thin, and their idea of ""witches"" is simply putting the popular, stuck-up, mean girls in cheap hoods and calling it a day. No makeup special effects or anything to indicate they might be evil or otherworldly. I was almost tempted to double check that I hadn't stumbled across a set of 90210 outtakes or lost Saved By the Bell footage. The sets are okay, if not a bit sterile - the whole thing takes place on a small college campus - but there's only maybe three of them and it can get tiring looking at the same thing over and over again. I suppose the only aspect of this movie I can defend with a clear conscience, and the reason I'm perhaps being overly generous with a 2-star rating, is Fivel Stewart, who I actually found to be quite likeable in the lead role but has a tough time holding her own when all the other actors around her might as well be cardboard cutouts.I admit I love my share of ""bad"" movies, and the fact a film is low budget shouldn't necessarily be a dealbreaker. But slapping the Hansel and Gretel moniker on any random teenage nonsense with the sole purpose of cashing in on a popular big-budget release struck me as pretty tacky. If ""Warriors of Witchcraft"" wasn't a total snoozefest in and of itself to start with I might be a little more forgiving of its blatant misrepresentation, but as it is, I'd advise leaving this one on the shelf.",2,"Lame and misleading; very ""after school special""",1361145600,"02 18, 2013",2013,2292,"['Having', 'absolutely', 'LOVED', 'Hansel', 'Gretel', 'Witch', 'Hunters', 'movie', 'theater', 'thought', ""'d"", 'check', 'out', 'low', 'budget', 'knockoff', 'knowing', 'full', 'well', 'advance', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'quite', 'awful', 'where', 'things', 'start', 'go', 'awry', 'fact', 'really', ""n't"", 'even', 'mockbluster', 'rather', 'completely', 'misleading', 'totally', 'different', 'kind', 'film', 'altogether', 'cover', 'art', 'would', 'no', 'doubt', 'lead', 'one', 'believe', 'sort', 'action-packed', 'fantasy', 'adventure', 'truth', 'more', 'school', 'special', 'geared', 'towards', 'teens', 'end', 'day', 'just', 'plain', 'boring', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'wear', 'outifts', 'are', 'pictured', 'there', 'sure', 'heck', 'ai', ""n't"", 'castle', 'wo', ""n't"", 'rehash', 'plot', 'many', 'others', 'here', 'have', 'done', 'already', 'say', 'connection', 'Hansel', 'Gretel', 'fairy', 'tale', 'otherwise', 'stretched', 'pretty', 'thin', 'idea', 'witches', 'simply', 'putting', 'popular', 'stuck-up', 'mean', 'girls', 'cheap', 'hoods', 'calling', 'day', 'makeup', 'special', 'effects', 'anything', 'indicate', 'might', 'be', 'evil', 'otherworldly', 'was', 'almost', 'tempted', 'double', 'check', 'had', ""n't"", 'stumbled', 'set', '90210', 'outtakes', 'lost', 'Saved', 'Bell', 'footage', 'sets', 'are', 'okay', 'not', 'bit', 'sterile', 'whole', 'thing', 'place', 'small', 'college', 'campus', 'only', 'maybe', 'three', 'can', 'get', 'tiring', 'looking', 'same', 'thing', 'over', 'again', 'suppose', 'only', 'aspect', 'movie', 'can', 'defend', 'clear', 'conscience', 'reason', ""'m"", 'perhaps', 'being', 'overly', 'generous', '2-star', 'rating', 'Fivel', 'Stewart', 'who', 'actually', 'found', 'be', 'quite', 'likeable', 'lead', 'role', 'tough', 'time', 'holding', 'own', 'when', 'other', 'actors', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'cardboard', 'cutouts.I', 'admit', 'love', 'share', 'bad', 'movies', 'fact', 'film', 'low', 'budget', 'should', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'be', 'dealbreaker', 'slapping', 'Hansel', 'Gretel', 'moniker', 'random', 'teenage', 'nonsense', 'sole', 'purpose', 'cashing', 'popular', 'big-budget', 'release', 'struck', 'pretty', 'tacky', 'Warriors', 'Witchcraft', 'was', ""n't"", 'total', 'snoozefest', 'start', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'forgiving', 'blatant', 'misrepresentation', ""'d"", 'advise', 'leaving', 'one', 'shelf']",Hansel & Gretel: Warriors of Witchcraft

I was like, ""seriously, this movie made it to theaters?""  It was easy to figure out who the great witch was and who the witch hunter was.  The fight scenes were weak and lacking.

Sadly that was the best thing about this movie.Let me first start off by telling you that there is no wardrobe like what you see on the cover. The twins do not wear black coats or do they have the same weapons. In fact, the girl doesn't even have magic fireball and the guy does. The girl has a small dagger and the guy doesn't have no long sword. I don't know what or where they got that cover from. Also, the cover shows a black spooky castle, there was no such thing inthe movie. It was at a private school the whole time!Okay, now moving on with the rest of the movie. The story was somewhat good, but there were a lot of drags in the move. The directing could had been much better and didn't need to have extra scenes to speed up the movie. The stunts were pretty bad and props and CGI were terrible. But, that's what they had to use for a low budget film. So, in most youtube videos' effects were the same effects you would see in this movie.If you love to watch these two twins than you wouldn't mind anything and still somewhat enjoy it. Their acting skills are great, so that part is pretty well set. If you're not fans of these two, then you probably wouldn't like this movie very much.

1603264,A1NTXJPTFP1G03,B009YQJ33G,"Van T. Roberts ""Film Historian""","[0, 1]","Although it cost about a million to make, ""Hansel & Gretel: Warriors of Witchcraft"" amounts to low-budget rubbish from fade-in to fade-out.  The cover art on the DVD is calculated to deceive.  Neither hero nor heroine ever are attired in the leather outfits that they wear.  They never wield swords, just knives with elaborate handles.  ""Final Stab"" director David DeCoteau started helming this kind of shoddy nonsense as far back as 1985, and he has called the shots on over 100 straight-to-video features.  The only celebrity actor in this supernatural nightmare is Eric Roberts, and he must have done it for the paycheck because ""Hansel & Gretel"" breaks no new ground.  This lackluster yarn follows a pair of real-life twins after they are expelled from one school and enrolled in another.  It seems Jonah (Boo Boo Stewart of ""Twilight"") cannot keep out of trouble.  Jonah's sister, Ellen (Fivel Stewart), has the brains of the family.  They wind up at an elite academy where the headmaster (Eric Roberts of ""The Expendables"") boasts about how some of their graduates when on to be presidents.  Suspiciously enough, Larson Tretter's shallow screenplay sounds like ""The Skulls.""  The incomprehensible plot unfolds with Jonah getting mixed up with the wrong types and participating in a ceremony where witch wannabes conjure up gilded swirling balls and launch them.  Ellen isn't invited into this inner circle.  She discovers an old piece of paper wrapped around a knife and concealed in a dresser.  It seems that their parents attended the same school and she learns that she is a slayer of witches.  The headmaster prepares her for her predicaments by slinging baseballs that she catches with relative ease.  Meantime, Jonah's friends try to convert him to their cause, but everything falls through for them.  One-dimensional characters cavort throughout this lethargic 83 minute silliness.  Nothing memorable or cool occurs.  There are no quotables lines.  DeCoteau would be great directing movies about clouds floating through blue skies.  The first half of the action--getting the protagonists from their first school to the present schoo--takes over a half-hour!  DeCoteau lingers endlessly on second unit shots of the dorm buildings and signs far longer than required.  The performances--with the exception of Eric Roberts (I'm no relation)--is abysmal.  Everybody blurts out their lines without feeling.  Similarly, everybody brushes their hair out of their eyes.  Apparently, the ability to groom themselves during action and dialogue qualified these stiff, mannequin-like thespians for this synthetic crap.  Foremost, ""Hansel & Gretel: Warriors of Witchcraft"" has nothing to do with the big-screen ""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters.""
