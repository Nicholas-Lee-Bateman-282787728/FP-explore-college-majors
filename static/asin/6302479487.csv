Later a group of swimmers find the body of that woman! The police find that woman's wallet in the possession of a homeless man living in a storm drain. Case solved? Carl Wayne Anderson is arrested. Miss Kathleen Riley is his Public Defender. They start off on the wrong foot. The accused is ""deaf and dumb""! Two politicians discuss a farm bill in Washington. Its not easy for Miss Riley to converse with her client. He describes ""Michael"" who found the body. Can she find this man with a private investigator? Miss Riley examines the jurors. Mr. Sanger is a lobbyist. The private investigator finds the man described, but he escapes. The trial goes on.The Prosecutor does his job against Anderson. [Why was nobody around at this parking lot?] Anderson suffered from contracting meningitis at a VA hospital and became handicapped. The pathologist waffles on a point of evidence. Is the judge biased against Riley? Juror Sanger talks to a Parking Lot attendant. Then he talks to a homeless woman about an identification pin. [Would such actions get him into trouble in the real world even if he was not a juror?] There is drama from a sudden attack at the Union railway station. [Believable at a busy public place?] Anderson writes he is ""innocent"". Riley and Sanger meet again. The Judge threatens Riley over meeting Sanger. Sanger has an idea where that pin came from. They find the body of another murder victim. Will this affect the trial? They find the lock for that key in a Justice Department locker. [Could strangers gain access to this building?]Riley and Sanger meet in a library. The trial judge arrives. They use a computer with a light pen to let Anderson testify in court. This brings out his past actions. In the rainy night someone breaks into a car in a parking lot and takes a tape cassette. [Would someone really put a confession on a tape cassette?] A fire alarm goes off in a building. Riley goes to a courthouse for research. Who is following her? Kathleen marks his arm. The next day there are conflicts in the courtroom! Will the guilty person be identified as ""red handed""? Will the defendant be cleared when Riley accuses the real murderer? [Do you find this ending believable?]It is a good story except for a plot that could have had a better ending. The 1963 novel ""The Seventh Juror"" had a similar plot. A better writer and script would create a better story. This was made just after the ""Contragate"" scandal when the Reagan-Bush administration was enabling drug smuggling into the USA. The details are in the book ""Compromised"" by Terry Reed. Who was the Governor of Arkansas then? Senators approve all Federal judges.

Back at the time it was made it was fresh enough to warrant your full attention, but now you may find yourself distracted.

By all means rent it. You may not have seen that many of this type law thriller movies. But if you are a fan of Grisham and other law movies, you may find it familiar. I wasn't disappointed in it, but I felt I knew what would happen next the whole time. And I was right. Cher is an attorney for Liam Neeson, a homeless Viet Nam veteran, that is accused of murdering a young woman. Dennis Quaid is a milk lobbyist that is on the jury for Neeson's trial. Things get out of hand when Quaid starts to investigate what really happened and feeds the information to Cher. Illegal? Yes but after all this is a Hollywood movie about the law, not the real law.

As Washington, D.C. public defender Kathleen Riley, Cher gets appointed by the court to defend a homeless deaf-mute (Lian Neeson, in one of his first substantial roles) accused in the brutal murder of a Justice Department file clerk. Setting out with a presumed guilt for her client, Ms. Riley comes to believe in her client's innocence and sets out to prove it. On the trial jury is dairy farm lobbyist Dennis Quaid who takes a judically improper and unethical active role in proving the defendant's innocence after he develops the hots for the defense counsel. Of course, the likelihood of a juror getting it on with the defense lawyer during trial is ludicrous and, in real life, would probably get both charged criminally and the lawyer disbarred. But the credible acting of the leads helps us to overlook that unlikely scenario and focus instead on who really done it. Anyone with any background knowledge of law, procedure and ethics might wonder about some of the judicial rulings handed down by the trial judge, but they figure significantly in the who and why of who really done it. Cher, by the time she made the film, was firmly established as a leading lady, and she demonstrates here that she can carry the responsibility.

Taylor ""GFT""","[15, 16]","When a deaf-mute homeless man is accused of murdering a federal worker in Washington DC, the public defender assigned to the case assumes he is guilty--until she begins to receive tips about the case from the most unlikely of sources: a member of the jury seated for the trial.  Any one even remotely conversant with the law will find the story so full of loopholes that it is more than a little ridiculous, but it scarcely matters: the cast carries it off in fine style, playing the script with exceptional precision and poise and generating plenty of suspense along the way. Cher is particularly noteworth as the public defender assigned to the case.  Cher?  Playing a Washington D.C. attorney?  It's hardly typecasting, but once more Cher demonstrates the depth of her talent: not only is she extremely effective, she is completely believable. The same might be said for both Liam Neeson, who plays the deaf-mute on trial, and Dennis Quaid, who plays the smarmy juror who begins to put two and two together; SUSPECT is clearly Cher's picture, but her co-stars are every bit as good as she.Although it has its share of courtroom pyrotechnics and suspenseful moments, SUSPECT is a surprisingly low-key and all the more successful for it. When all is said and done we like the characters as people, believe in them, and are glad we met them.  While it will never compete with the likes of Hitchcock, SUSPECT is a good, solid, and very unpretentious courtroom thriller excuted with a great deal of style.  Those whose tastes run in that direction will be very pleased indeed.

The original has deeply meaningful script and stunning performances. Suspect is shallow. It is a great example of how not to make movies. The plot is variation of To Kill A Mockingbird's story. They've changed the lawyer's sex - it is now female and the defendant is a white, not a black man. Cher's  pathetic imitation of Gregory Peck's brilliant performance makes the whole court process in Suspect  a farce. She even asks her client fetch an object, to prove he is innocent. Didn't Gregory Pack do the same?  Yes, he did it.  I understand how difficult it must be to make an original film these days. Everything original is implemented and exploited to death. Some repetition is inevitable and in fact necessary. But copying great ideas and making bad movies is ridiculous. There is still room for originality but it is probably hard work. So the makers of Suspect chose an easy solution: steal the plot of a masterpiece, modernize it, have couple of  popular names in the cast and you have a movie! Wrong, simply wrong!I used to like Liam Neeson a lot. He is a talented actor and has some outstanding acting achievements, but after seeing him in three less than average productions, I realised that I am not getting a fear deal. No more Liam Neeson's movies for me.Film is one of the greatest achievements of human intelligence.

Cher plays the dedicated public defender who takes on the homeless man's case.  Liam Neeson in one of his early roles plays Carl, the deaf and dumb accused with a tight passion and volatile flair that makes him very sympathetic.  Dennis Quaid as the lobbyist who finds himself on the jury does well with his role, but it's hard to believe a juror would get so involved and risk not only a mistrial but possibly a disbarment for legal eagle Cher.  Quaid and Cher's rapport is so tight, though, we can forgive the writer for this implausible scenario.  John Mahoney is excellent as the stiff upper lipped judge who begins to suspect that Cher and Quaid may be working together.  Joe Mantegna as the prosecuting attorney brings a haughty, but commendable, self righteousness to his role.  There are some suspenseful moments and the movie is very enjoyable.

314790,A2ZVERVFM25MJT,6302479487,"Mr. B. G. Fowler ""ben1283""","[8, 11]","Scenario: Cher as a disheartened lawyer defends deaf and mute tramp Neeson in a murder case, using Quaid, a member of the jury, to lead a behind-closed-doors investigation to suggest that the murder may go further up than anyone expected.  So what you're in for is pretty much definitely going to be completely contrived, but not necessarily complete tripe.  This is in main part due to some very good performances from the three central characters.  Cher is surprisingly unglamorous and convincing as the tough cookie lawyer, whilst her sexual chemistry with Quaid is wholly believably.  Quaid himself enjoys himself immensely in a role of unflappable lobbyist, and Neeson shows surprising depth for a character that after all has no dialogue.  One scene in particular where he is outright accused of not only murder, but uselessness and an inability to adapt to normal society is one to which he reacts to in a not only believably outraged fashion but also in an equally believably emotional way.With such good performances then it seems a shame that Suspect so often falls into clich&eacute;, in particular in the `twist' at the end that reveals the real perpetrator of the crime.  Not only is it entirely unbelievably but it also seems tagged on the end, especially given the seemingly last minute decision to have Cher act as your typical scream queen (albeit wearing a suit and high heels) as we find her running down a corridor followed by an ominous shadowy figure whose face we don't get to see.  Even the detective work seems distinctly fishy, with Quaid having no problems walking through the slums in the middle of the night, nor Cher breaking into a car.  That said though, the chemistry between the leads does jumpstart things a fair few times, not least in the court scenes, where their sparring provides the best entertainment of the entire film.  Still, for a movie that starts off with a central topic of Neeson's murder case, it strays far too often away from the subject and into the `forbidden romance' territory.Whilst Suspect isn't bad (certainly doing nothing to damage the actors' reputations), it's not on par with the far superior Jagged Edge, or the later Primal Fear.

She made a string of very successful and well-loved films during her brief moment as an A-list actress, and while this one is definitely first-rate, it is possibly the most underappreciated.For starters, the cast does a spectacular job with what could have been a disastrous movie.  Cher is amazing as always, Liam Neeson is great, and even Dennis Quaid, in an earlier role, is pretty good.  The interraction between the characters is what makes the movie so good, mystery story notwithstanding.  There are some pretty fast-paced moments which can be very exciting, and the ending is surprising, but if you think about it, makes plenty of sense.The thing that makes the film flawed the most is what should be the foundation of the film:  the mystery.  Quaid's character is a juror of a trial, and out of nowhere, he becomes some busybody who starts looking for evidence himself, and partnering with the defense lawyer, Kathleen Riley.  It seems hard to believe that a juror would care so much that they take their own time to find evidence, and it's even harder to believe that a lawyer would willingly agree to the setup.  It's also very hard to follow the case, unless you're big onto mystery stories, which I usually am not.In general, the film falters from trying to be a film for Cher fans and a film for mystery fans.

Also, the fact that once the jury was ordered ""sequestered"" after their forbidden contact was observed, Quaid still had no problem being out and about conducting his own detective work which I consider an impossibility.But a few weaknesses can be forgiven; because it definitely was a story disclosing the vulnerability of the powerless when accused that could certainly happen; through ""rush to judgement"" without due process if for no other reason. And I had no trouble at all believing that informed people can be ""eliminated"" should they become a liability to those that consider themselves ""above the law"" - even as they they profess to uphold it.Liam Neeson turns in a good performance as the ""suspect"".
