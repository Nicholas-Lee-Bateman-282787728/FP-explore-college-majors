While I thought the 2004 version was not a bad film it felt nothing like the comic book character I grew up reading.  My biggest mistake was thinking that this film (2008) was going to be like the 2004 one and so I avoided going to see it in the theater.  My Mistake!!  I recently viewed the film on DVD and was pleased.  This film was better than the previous two in almost every way; from lead actor, to story setting, and to villains.  The films ending was a bit rushed and weak but all in all a great adaptation.The opening fight scene was the first indicator that this film was on the right track.  The Punisher punished, without remorse or hesitation, those that needed punishing.  The actor (Ray Stevenson) who portrayed the Punisher did a great job in portraying the Punishers hard side as well as his softer side, as when dealing with the victims, and seemed to be born to play this role.My guess is that if you grew up reading the Punisher comics than this film will appeal to you.  If you're first encounter with the Punisher was the 2004 film it may not appeal to you.  Personally I hope Marvel gives this franchise one more chance and authorizes a sequel.",4,Works for Me!!!,1244764800,"06 12, 2009",2009,1287,"['do', ""n't"", 'really', 'remember', '1989', 'version', 'comic', 'probably', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'do', 'remember', '2004', 'version', 'thought', '2004', 'version', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'felt', 'nothing', 'comic', 'book', 'character', 'grew', 'up', 'reading', 'biggest', 'mistake', 'was', 'thinking', 'film', '2008', 'was', 'going', 'be', '2004', 'one', 'so', 'avoided', 'going', 'see', 'theater', 'Mistake', 'recently', 'viewed', 'film', 'DVD', 'was', 'pleased', 'film', 'was', 'better', 'previous', 'two', 'almost', 'way', 'lead', 'actor', 'story', 'setting', 'villains', 'films', 'ending', 'was', 'bit', 'rushed', 'weak', 'great', 'adaptation.The', 'opening', 'fight', 'scene', 'was', 'first', 'indicator', 'film', 'was', 'right', 'track', 'Punisher', 'punished', 'remorse', 'hesitation', 'needed', 'punishing', 'actor', 'Ray', 'Stevenson', 'who', 'portrayed', 'Punisher', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'portraying', 'Punishers', 'hard', 'side', 'as', 'well', 'softer', 'side', 'when', 'dealing', 'victims', 'seemed', 'be', 'born', 'play', 'role.My', 'guess', 'grew', 'up', 'reading', 'Punisher', 'comics', 'film', 'will', 'appeal', ""'re"", 'first', 'encounter', 'Punisher', 'was', '2004', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'appeal', 'Personally', 'hope', 'Marvel', 'franchise', 'one', 'more', 'chance', 'sequel']",N/A

I think the warning for pervasive strong brutal violence is a bit of an understatement. From minute one to the closing this movie was forcing ""punishment"" in your face (including the one guy whose face caved in under the punishers fist!). It stays true to the comics appeal of him being the nasty hero that all heroes despise because he is not about ""justice"", but again ""punishent"". There is no back story, thanks to the previous one with thomas jane they didn't need to build the character as you should have seen the previous. So what that the dialogue sucked, it's based on a comic book which always has corny phrasing and moments.

Customer,"[85, 102]","For anyone who ever read any Punisher comics growing up, or still are as adults, then they can attest that they are constantly full of violence, blood, guts and gore, and very light on comedy.  Fantastic Four, The X-Men, and The Hulk CANNOT be compared to The Punisher in anyway, so if someone watches these other Marvel movies and likes them, then attempts to watch this newest Punisher movie expecting the same lighthearted cartoon violence and humor, then it would have been like going to the polls and actually thinking a vote for McCain would've meant something (oops, too soon?).  Getting back on topic, out of the 3 actors who've starred as the title character, Ray Stevenson has looked the MOST like the Punisher during the War Zone story arc.  He was big, gritty, gruff, and not clean shaven.  He wasn't a pretty boy like Thomas Jane, and he wasn't some eastern bloc pinko like Dolph Lundgren (seriously, who the hell casted him?!  Jesse Ventura would've even been a better choice!)So in short, I'm giving this movie 5 stars, because as a true Punisher fan, this movie is the closest to the comics as any of the movies.  The first movie was beyond pathetic.  The second was good, in fact much of the plot taken directly out of Punisher comics, but way too much humor injected into it and not enough action.  This movie has all the action, blood, and death, plus Jigsaw, The Punisher's arch-nemesis.  OH, and by the way, Jigsaw has been around since the 1980s...he wasn't invented after the filming of the Saw movies, so if you think his name was ripped from other movies, well, you're an idiot.So for those of you who also truly loved the Punisher back in the old days, watch this movie!

1230403,A2NHOMBKYV5HOG,B001QB9H1U,Alex Faber,"[14, 19]","The previous Punishers were always a disappointment for me:  I feel Thomas Jane was a phenomenal Punisher in the 04 version, but the movie itself was all over the place stylistically and, as an origin story, was pedestrian, while the Dolph Lundgren version was more focused, yet still was unconvincing as a Punisher story. This movie surprised the hell out of me with the amount of violence and gore, and what surprised me even more was that it all fit and all worked. This IS The Punisher: unrelenting and unstoppable. It goes down in this movie, and I'm thrilled to see the studio didn't hold back. There's no prospect of salvation here - only a doomed walk towards damnation and death. This Punisher sees that and just keeps walking. It loses a couple of points for Ray Stevenson's inability to emote well, along with the neo-metal soundtrack, which connotes this is purely for the 15-year-old Monster-swilling crowd. It ain't. It may not be perfect, but I think this may be the most satisfying Punisher adaptation yet. Oh, and Dash Mihok gets a lot of screen time - always good.Now this is a review for the whole DVD, not just the movie, so on to the packaging.  The single-disc version comes with a pretty standard paperboard slipcase, which is cool, and I think the artwork on this puppy looks better than that on the 2-disc version, but that's all this has going for it.  The DVD is a flipper disc, which means no artwork and twice as likely to get scratched.Beyond that, the DVD case is something called an ""Eco Box,"" which has the same dimensions as a regular DVD case, but has sections of the black part of the case cut out to reduce the use of plastic in packaging.  Brothers and sisters, I'm all for companies being more environmentally conscious when it comes to packaging, but this is the case we're talking about, and honestly, it looks terrible - I switched mine to a regular case immediately.  Some logical environmental changes, such as use of cellulose in place of plastic, reduction of security tabs (this one had two), or using recycled plastic cases would make more sense to me.So, I honestly thought the movie was pretty tight, but I have an inherent aversion to flipper discs - to get the movie with a printed disc, go for the 2-disc version.

The Punisher of the comics may have been a ruthless killer but he wouldn't be so foolish as to wear body armor without plates. Its obvious through the whole film that hes not got any SAPI plates in his vest. And what happened to the colt 1911's? Even Marvel's official Punisher page says he often uses "" .45 automatics"" (the original military description of the 1911 pistol). There is nothing about this movie that makes it seem as though they looked at the comics as a reference. Ray Stevenson just runs around spraying bullets like a lunatic with no EXPERIENCE AS A SPECIAL FORCES INSTRUCTOR (it is quoted in the movie that he was once a special forces instructor).On the production side, the background music does not always seem to match the scene. Alot of times a background song starts up only to end a few seconds later. This sort of abruptness is distracting and succeeds only in killing the scene. Another thing... Why did they write a Punisher script that only focuses on one major villan when almost every other Marvel and DC movie of the last twenty years has had more than one?

Etnyre ""roguemissive""","[0, 0]","The Mrs. and I watched two movies this weekend:PUNISHER: WAR ZONEQUANTUM OF SOLACEThe latter is of course the latest James Bond film.  As most everyone knows, this film currently features the sixth actor to portray the eponymous, iconic lead character role.  The former film listed, PUNISHER: WAR ZONE, is the third in its own cinematic series as well, and features the third actor to portray the main character of Frank Castle.  This time, it's Ray Stephenson (who did such a great job in ROME as Titus Pullo).  This is probably the second most violent film I have seen in quite a while - maybe ever (the first place spot still is held by the most recent RAMBO film).  Stephenson was a good pick for the role (possibly the best Frank Castle selection to date, though all have been good to varying degrees), and performed it adequately - which is more than I can say for his co-stars.The acting overall kind of sucked.  It was mostly British actors trying to sound like East Coast guido-thugs or precinct cops (not very convincingly).  Accents would veer in and out of various regional influences, sometimes finding their way back towards where they were intended; sometimes not quite so lucky.  That's not to say that British actors don't have the chops to pull it off.  On the contrary, British actors are often the most talented and effective castmembers in films where they are playing Americans - in many cases even better than their actual American co-stars.  Not this time though.  The film even added the creepy & fey Doug Hutchinson, who once again overplays an unhinged psycho to the level of high camp.  Even though he is an American, his attempted east coast Italian mafia accent is also comically bad (and he is remarkably non-ethnic looking for such a role).  His selection to the film was frankly the most questionable casting decision (of many).The performances tend to fall into either the category of understated/minimalist (pretty much just Stephenson and Wayne Knight) or overdone (everyone else).  Since many of actors who did such mediocre-to-poor performances are actually somewhat talented and have done good work elsewhere (Dominic West, Colin Salmon, Dash Mihok, Julie Benz), then the blame should go squarely to the director and the bad dialogue soaked throughout the film's script.  All this, when teamed with VERY graphic and explicit violence, may technically make this an exploitation film (by definition).  Regrettably, there was little-to-nothing in the female nudity department.I might give this film 2.5 stars if the option were available, but otherwise I give it 3 stars rather than 2 for technical competency and decent pacing.If it's extreme violence you're looking for, this film is for you.

But, being a fan of The Punisher comic & of the previous movies, I was curious to see how this one fared so I bought it. Man, let me tell you--I was quite surprised to see this version of The Punisher wasn't watered down like the previous installments. Oh no, my friend....it is filled with wall-to-wall kills. I'm not talking about the garden-variety either. These are some of the inventive kind just like in the comic book. My jaw dropped when I saw what I saw in the movie. This is the kinda Punisher movie I've been waiting on.The film is an original telling of Frank Castle's war on crime and corruption rather than a sequel to 2004's The Punisher. It is the first film to be produced under the Marvel Knights production banner, which will focus on films for more mature audiences, which according to Marvel will be a handful of them. The story itself takes place about five or six years into his being The Punisher. The whole town knows of his exploits. When he brutally assaults a party for notorious mob boss Gaitano Cesare, he is alerted to the fact that Billy Russoti has escaped to his recycling plant hideout.  Castle invades Russoti's hideout and murders Nicky Donatelli as he exits the bathroom. This alerts Russoti and he tries to make a run for it. A brief fire fight between Castle and Russoti ensues, ending in Russoti being thrown into a glass-crushing machine which ends up leaving the gangster hideously disfigured, thus making him into Jigsaw.  Castle, who has taken cover behind the body of Donatelli, realizes that the man he killed was an undercover FBI Agent. Distraught by what he has done, he tries to make things right with the man's wife and child, to no avail. He then plans to give up his life as The Punisher. However, upon hearing information from his partner and armorer, Microchip, his plans quickly change once he learns that Jigsaw has learned of Donatelli's family's existence, and will be going after them for revenge. It is time for The Punisher to do what he does best...Punish! And, that my friend, he does!!!Ray Stevenson's performance as the Punisher is the closest anyone has ever come to The Punisher from the comic. He even looks like the comic version of Frank Castle. Don't get me wrong, I loved Thomas Jane's version but this one I loved even more. Other stellar performances by Dominic West(The Wire) and Doug Hutchison(who some of you might remember as Percy Wetmore in The Green Mile) make this movie even more great.So, what do I have to say to you about the movie? Well, get this movie. It's a really good movie. Besides, I'd love to see Ray Stevenson return as The Punisher again. The only way that is going to happen is if DVD sales do well and I hope they do. Be warned, though, this movie ain't your usual Marvel Superhero fare...so, don't let kids watch it. It is brutal to the core. Which is why I love it so much, lol!The two-disc special edition includes:Audio commentary with Director Lexi Alexander and Director of Photography Steve Gainer, The Making of Punisher: War Zone,  Meet Jigsaw, The Weapons of the Punisher, Training to Become the Punisher, Creating the Look of the Film,(which are all featurettes) plus the theatrical trailer and looks at other movies from Lionsgate(one of which I'd like to mention..The Burrowers).The professional reviewers who state that this movie is a turkey and was a waste of celluloid are just plain cuckoo.

J.Travolta is a great actor but i dont know he kinda was lacking his believability in The Punisher> yep its Punisher War Zone time :Dthis time the guys with the suit decided to go with the adult series Marvel Knights: The Punisher series.the overall designs were based on Dillons rendition. and the cast were right on the spot.R.Stevenson is one cool looking guy, he is built, rough and has cold and hard edged looks.he kinda filled the costume with the skull just as good as T.Jane even better.he was not that fluent in the action scenes as opposed to T.Janes physical performance but he hold his own pretty good.the violence was right one spot.real gunfights are grittythey are not pretty.and the little exageration kinda served all its intends and purposes, Looked great!!!!the overall movie had a dark tone and shadowy settings which we all know punisher chooses for himself in the comics most commonly.we had the classic villain from the Punishers Rogue gallery :D The Jigsaw :Dall in all PWZ was a success as far as me, i fan is concerned. who cares if it sucked at the box office. i believe it was a bad release timing that kinda crashed it making better monetarilyenough talking.. if you have ever read a punisher comic or even seen him in his cameos or guest appreances in other marvel comics do see this movie.you will see for yourself why fans liked this one better than its two releases.Punisher really delivers the final shot and only then takes names after the body hit the ground dead cold in this flick.cheers",5,The best Punisher adaptation yet,1274054400,"05 17, 2010",2010,2492,"['First', 'lets', 'take', 'walk', 'progress', 'screen', '>', 'i', 'liked', ""'89"", 'Punisher', 'kinda', 'started', 'leather', 'clad', 'hero', 'trend', 'was', 'mean', 'looked', 'cool', 'movie', 'was', 'average', 'kinda', 'hold', 'own', 'decade', 'was', 'shot', 'amongst', 'other', 'action', 'flicks', '>', '2004', 'T.Jane', 'whom', 'i', 'think', 'new', 'C.Lambert', 'D', 'was', 'great', 'duds', 'skull', 'looked', 'good', 'car', 'was', 'awesome', 'short', 'lived', 'P', 'cast', 'overall', 'production', 'value', 'was', 'ok.it', 'was', 'good', 'origin', 'moviehad', 'heart', 'Eye', 'Eye', 'story', 'comics', 'yep', 'changed', 'picnic', 'family', 'gathering', 'served', 'cause', 'aside', 'Russian', 'scene', 'lacked', 'Punisher', 'intensity', 'are', 'used', 'comics.he', 'looked', 'part', 'T.Jane', 'was', 'too', 'baby', 'faced', 'kinda', 'more', 'Jim', 'Lee', 'version', 'character', 'War', 'Zone', 'artist', 'John', 'Romita', 'Jr', 'captured', 'more', 'rugged', 'hard', 'look', 'fave', 'er', 'guilty', 'Doh', 'villain', 'was', 'kinda', 'weak', 'too', 'J.Travolta', 'great', 'actor', 'i', 'dont', 'know', 'kinda', 'was', 'lacking', 'believability', 'Punisher', '>', 'Punisher', 'War', 'Zone', 'time', 'Dthis', 'time', 'guys', 'suit', 'decided', 'go', 'adult', 'series', 'Marvel', 'Knights', 'Punisher', 'series.the', 'overall', 'designs', 'were', 'based', 'Dillons', 'rendition', 'cast', 'were', 'right', 'spot.R.Stevenson', 'one', 'cool', 'looking', 'guy', 'built', 'rough', 'cold', 'hard', 'edged', 'looks.he', 'kinda', 'filled', 'costume', 'skull', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'T.Jane', 'even', 'better.he', 'was', 'not', 'fluent', 'action', 'scenes', 'opposed', 'T.Janes', 'physical', 'performance', 'hold', 'own', 'pretty', 'good.the', 'violence', 'was', 'right', 'one', 'spot.real', 'gunfights', 'are', 'grittythey', 'are', 'not', 'pretty.and', 'little', 'exageration', 'kinda', 'served', 'purposes', 'Looked', 'great', 'overall', 'movie', 'had', 'dark', 'tone', 'shadowy', 'settings', 'know', 'punisher', 'chooses', 'comics', 'most', 'commonly.we', 'had', 'classic', 'villain', 'Punishers', 'Rogue', 'gallery', 'D', 'Jigsaw', 'Dall', 'PWZ', 'was', 'success', 'as', 'far', 'i', 'fan', 'concerned', 'who', 'sucked', 'box', 'office', 'i', 'believe', 'was', 'bad', 'release', 'timing', 'crashed', 'making', 'better', 'talking..', 'have', 'ever', 'read', 'punisher', 'comic', 'even', 'seen', 'cameos', 'guest', 'appreances', 'other', 'marvel', 'comics', 'do', 'see', 'movie.you', 'will', 'see', 'why', 'fans', 'liked', 'one', 'better', 'two', 'releases.Punisher', 'really', 'final', 'shot', 'only', 'then', 'names', 'body', 'hit', 'ground', 'dead', 'cold', 'flick.cheers']",N/A

1230422,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001QB9H1U,Chris Pandolfi,"[0, 2]","I'm not too sure if ""Punisher: War Zone"" is a comic book adaptation or milder version of an exploitation film. There are moments when it seemed like it wanted to be a comic book, not the least of which are the action scenes, which are so preposterous that you can't help but be somewhat entertained by them. Everything else, however, felt like a freak show, a look-at-this-if-you-dare exercise, an excuse to indulge in the grotesque. For all I know, that's exactly what the original ""Punisher"" magazines were going for; I haven't read a single issue. But even if that's the case, shouldn't there be something more to a film adaptation than brutal death scenes? As good-looking as this movie is, the story is paper thin, and boy, is it violent. Not violent in that fun comic book way, but in that bloody disgusting way that's really best left for campy horror films. You will see many gory acts in the course of this movie, from heads being blown up to bodies getting impaled to a man's kidney being ripped out and eaten.It doesn't help that the performances are hilariously bad. Considering the fact that moments of the story actually go for serious drama, it's a little hard to believe that it was intentional. Let's start with the title character, a.k.a., Frank Castle. He's played by Ray Stevenson, a British actor that can't seem to hide behind a fake American accent no matter how hard he tries. I wasn't bothered by his monotone voice. Remember, he's playing a character whose wife and children were horribly murdered; that would leave anyone just shy of emotionless, and that's helpful when you take it upon yourself to rid the city of crime. I was, however, bothered by Stevenson's lack of originality, an inability to make the Punisher anything more than what we're already used to. He doesn't perform so much as he recites his lines, which is incredibly boring for such a ruthless antihero.And then there's the film's main villain, who starts as a vain crime boss named Billy Russoti. He's played by Dominic West, another British actor. His fake New York accent is so exaggerated that it actually surpasses a lampoon. It's a lampoon of a lampoon--he's making fun of actors that make fun of hard-edged New York accents. I'd ask if he even took his role seriously, but considering the ridiculous natures of the plot and his character, there's no need. At a certain point, during an especially brutal fight scene in some kind of factory, the Punisher drops Russoti into machine that grinds glass bottles into little shards. The Punisher then turns the machine on. Russoti screams obscenities as glass tears his face to shreds. Later on, in a moment too reminiscent of the mirror scene in Tim Burton's ""Batman,"" Russoti sits on a chair at a plastic surgeon's office, his entire head bandaged. The surgeon removes the bandages, revealing Russoti's horribly disfigured face; pronounced stitches trail over grafted skin that looks like it's been stretched one too many times. Because of his looks, he no longer goes by his given name. He's now called Jigsaw, a name that could have been original were it not for the ""Saw"" series.Hiding somewhere within this visual sideshow is a plot, one that isn't a sequel to the 2004 film ""The Punisher"" so much as it's a complete rewrite. The location has shifted from Tampa Bay, Florida to New York City, where Castle is seen as nothing more than a crazed vigilante in the eyes of the NYPD. He sets his sites on Russoti, who's in talks with the Russian Mafia to have biological weapons shipped into the city and given to terrorist factions. Castle's attempts to bring Russoti down backfire when he accidentally kills an FBI agent disguised as one of Russoti's men; consumed with guilt, Castle vows to make it up to the agent's widow (Julie Benz) and young daughter (Stephanie Janusauskas). But that won't be so easy. Russoti, now Jigsaw, has broken his psychopathic brother, James ""Looney Bin Jim"" Russoti (Doug Hutchison), out of the local mental hospital, and they both have the agent's family in their sites. Hoping to bring the Punisher down, Jigsaw recruits an army of gangsters from all over the city.Meanwhile, another FBI agent, Paul Budiansky (Colin Salmon), teams up with a goofy NYPD detective named Martin Soap (Dash Mihok) with the intention of finding the Punisher. For Budiansky, it's personal; his partner was the one the Punisher unintentionally killed. As usual, Castle has no plans to play by the rules, and with a little help from his personal weapons dealer, Linus ""Microchip"" Lieberman (Wayne Knight), he'll be more than adequately equipped to track down Jigsaw and bring him to justice.If only this movie was fun. It certainly could have been, but the over-the-top violence and gore greatly weighs it down. I might have even gotten a kick out of the bad performances had there not been so many dramatic pauses featuring Stevenson and Janusauskas, all of which were approached so unoriginally. Their characters constantly stare at each other with sorrow in their eyes, and yes, I know that that was the point. Still, I couldn't help but feel that something more complex could have been developed, something that would reveal more than the fact that these characters are lost souls. I'm a firm believer that even comic book adaptations can be both escapist and meaningful--we certainly got that from this year's brilliant ""Iron Man."" But ""Punisher: War Zone"" is a comic book film that skimps on the both the comic and the book parts; it's for people who only laugh at pain and don't regard reading as a legitimate form of

1230429,A9NCQGVV5W8N0,B001QB9H1U,"darklordzden ""darklordzden""","[1, 2]","First the good:Ray Stevenson really is the most faithful incarnation of Frank Castle to make it to the screen. He looks like Frank, he moves like Frank and - one ridiculous sequence involving suspending himself upside down from a Chandelier to shoot, aside - he fights like Frank. He is vastly preferable to Thomas Jane's truly awful, fey, coffered stick-figure incarnation and Dolph Lundgren's shot at the title (which, while decent enough, had the misfortune of being saddled to a truly cheesy film).Also, the violence:Oh, there's lots of it. Gore flies with gay abandon: heads explode, throats are slashed, fists pulverize skulls, free-runners are shot with Bazookas (no, I'm not joking), hearts are devoured, faces are eviscerated with broken bottles. This is not a film to watch with your nervous great aunt.Kudos to Lexi Alexander for refusing to tone down the violence that is at the heart of big Frank.Now, the bad:Unfortunately, the plot lacks polish. The sub-plot with the widow and child in danger completely mires the whole thing in a bog of schmaltz and it jars with the nihilistic tone of the rest of the film. It was, frankly, unnecessary as Frank's dance of death and mutilation with 'Jigsaw' (Dominic West) and war of wills with Colin Salmon's driven detective was more than interesting enough to hold the audience's attention. I found myself praying for less bonding moments with little girls and more of the bitterly sardonic dialogue that embodied the Garth Ennis version of the character. I think the creative team behind this film really missed a trick by not having Frank narrate at least some of his twisted philosophy as a voice-over. I'm surprised, given how well it works inPunisher: Welcome Back, Frank (Marvel Premiere Classic), that noone has picked up on this, which is essentially one of the greatest hallmarks of the character, and played to it's strength. How cool would it be to hear the ""contrary old bitch, the Uzi..."" speech over the top of aGoodFellasstyle freeze-frame just before Frank starts unloading with said gun?Also, Dash Mihok was truly bloody awful as 'Soap'. I know he's meant to be a cheesy character and all, but Mihok mugs through his role like Matt LeBlanc in a bad episode of 'Friends' and it really does jar with the otherwise excellent performances from Stevenson, West and Colin Salmon (what's with you yanks employing all-British leads in this film? Surely you've got to have some decent actors of your own?).That and the lighting - dear god, the lighting. The one film that would've benefited from the now 'de rigueur' practice of desaturating colours on film stock in order to give the story a gritty feel and yet the director and cinematographer made the stylistic choice to light it likeBatman Forever. Wrong, wrong, wrong.To sum up then...If you want carnage - it delivers.If you want a decent action film with the emphasis on dodgy CGI headshots, dodgy CGI explosions and Brie - it delivers.If you want to see Garth Ennis' take on the Punisher, which let's be honest is the incarnation which has truly resurrected the character, up onscreen - Well, you 'sort of' will here. That said, I couldn't help wishing that they'd just done a straight adaptation of one of his MAX or Marvel Knight books.And at least we should be grateful that this one isn't set in Tampa...",3,"All In All, A Mixed Bag...",1247616000,"07 15, 2009",2009,3329,"['First', 'good', 'Ray', 'Stevenson', 'really', 'most', 'faithful', 'incarnation', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'make', 'screen', 'Frank', 'Frank', 'one', 'ridiculous', 'sequence', 'involving', 'suspending', 'upside', 'down', 'Chandelier', 'shoot', 'aside', 'Frank', 'vastly', 'preferable', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'truly', 'awful', 'fey', 'coffered', 'stick-figure', 'incarnation', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'shot', 'title', 'decent', 'enough', 'had', 'misfortune', 'being', 'saddled', 'truly', 'cheesy', 'film', '.Also', 'violence', 'Oh', 'lots', 'Gore', 'gay', 'abandon', 'heads', 'explode', 'throats', 'are', 'slashed', 'fists', 'pulverize', 'skulls', 'free-runners', 'are', 'shot', 'Bazookas', ""'m"", 'not', 'joking', 'hearts', 'are', 'devoured', 'are', 'eviscerated', 'broken', 'bottles', 'not', 'film', 'watch', 'nervous', 'great', 'aunt.Kudos', 'Lexi', 'Alexander', 'refusing', 'tone', 'down', 'violence', 'heart', 'big', 'Frank.Now', 'bad', 'Unfortunately', 'plot', 'polish', 'sub-plot', 'widow', 'child', 'danger', 'completely', 'whole', 'thing', 'bog', 'schmaltz', 'nihilistic', 'tone', 'rest', 'film', 'was', 'frankly', 'unnecessary', 'Frank', 'dance', 'death', 'mutilation', ""'Jigsaw"", 'Dominic', 'West', 'war', 'wills', 'Colin', 'Salmon', 'driven', 'detective', 'was', 'more', 'interesting', 'enough', 'hold', 'audience', 'attention', 'found', 'praying', 'less', 'bonding', 'moments', 'little', 'girls', 'more', 'bitterly', 'sardonic', 'dialogue', 'embodied', 'Garth', 'Ennis', 'version', 'character', 'think', 'creative', 'team', 'film', 'really', 'missed', 'trick', 'not', 'having', 'Frank', 'narrate', 'least', 'twisted', 'philosophy', 'voice-over', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'given', 'how', 'well', 'inPunisher', 'Welcome', 'Back', 'Frank', 'Marvel', 'Premiere', 'Classic', 'noone', 'picked', 'up', 'essentially', 'one', 'greatest', 'hallmarks', 'character', 'played', 'strength', 'How', 'cool', 'would', 'be', 'hear', 'contrary', 'old', 'bitch', 'Uzi', 'speech', 'top', 'aGoodFellasstyle', 'freeze-frame', 'just', 'Frank', 'unloading', 'said', 'gun', 'Also', 'Dash', 'Mihok', 'was', 'truly', 'bloody', 'awful', ""'Soap"", 'know', 'meant', 'be', 'cheesy', 'character', 'Mihok', 'mugs', 'role', 'Matt', 'LeBlanc', 'bad', 'episode', ""'Friends"", 'really', 'jar', 'otherwise', 'excellent', 'performances', 'Stevenson', 'West', 'Colin', 'Salmon', 'what', 'yanks', 'employing', 'all-British', 'leads', 'film', 'Surely', ""'ve"", 'got', 'have', 'decent', 'actors', 'own', 'lighting', 'dear', 'god', 'lighting', 'one', 'film', 'would', ""'ve"", 'benefited', 'now', 'rigueur', 'practice', 'desaturating', 'colours', 'film', 'stock', 'order', 'give', 'story', 'gritty', 'feel', 'yet', 'director', 'cinematographer', 'made', 'stylistic', 'choice', 'light', 'likeBatman', 'Forever', 'Wrong', 'wrong', 'wrong.To', 'sum', 'up', 'then', 'want', 'carnage', 'want', 'decent', 'action', 'film', 'emphasis', 'dodgy', 'CGI', 'headshots', 'dodgy', 'CGI', 'explosions', 'Brie', 'want', 'see', 'Garth', 'Ennis', 'take', 'Punisher', 'let', 'be', 'honest', 'incarnation', 'truly', 'resurrected', 'character', 'up', 'onscreen', 'Well', ""'sort"", 'will', 'here', 'said', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'wishing', ""'d"", 'just', 'done', 'straight', 'adaptation', 'one', 'MAX', 'Marvel', 'Knight', 'books.And', 'least', 'should', 'be', 'grateful', 'one', ""n't"", 'set', 'Tampa']",N/A
1230430,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,B001QB9H1U,Dave. K,"[0, 0]","PUNISHER: WAR ZONE**** Out of 5Release Date- December 5th, 2008Running Time- 103-MinutesRating- RScreenplay- Nick Santora, Art Marcum & Matt HollowayDirector- Lexi AlexanderStarring- Ray Stevenson, Julie Benz, Colin Salmon, Wayne Knight, Doug Hutchinson and Dominic West as JigsawPunisher: War Zone is one of those movies that falls under the category of so bad it's good. By no means can Punisher: War Zone be labeled a good movie, but it works on that so bad it's good level and most importantly the movie is highly entertaining. Lionsgate didn't really do much marketing for the movie and it ended up being a box office disaster, which probably would have been the case even if the marketing was good. This movie doesn't have mass appeal and will play best with the fans of the comic book and fans of B-movies. If you want a blood soaked action movie than here you go. War Zone is loaded with graphic and bloody violence and more than makes up for the flaws of the movie.Punisher: War Zone doesn't continue from the 2004 Punisher movie so I guess War Zone is a reboot of the series. One thing that does surprise me is a lot of people seem to like War Zone more than the Punisher 2004; I thought The Punisher was a really good movie that was a lot darker than I thought it would be. About the only problem I had was the mixture of serious in tone and comic book villains. The two didn't really fit together. Now I some people are saying well it's based off a comic book so what do you expect? But the dark tone of Punisher 2004 didn't fit with the comic style villains where as the comic book style villains work in War Zone due to the tone of the movie. From a pure filmmaking aspect The Punisher 2004 is by far the better of the two, but from an entertaining aspect they are about even.The screenplay by Nick Santora, Art Marcum & Matt Holloway is rather weak; it's filled with poor dialogue and little plot and characters that are never developed at all, but despite that the script works due to the pure camp factor. I thought Frank Castle in the 2004 version was quite interesting and was well developed, but here they never really tap into the character. Castle is a broken down man whose life as he knows it is over and that's what I liked in the 2004 version is they get into that. But regardless the script for War Zone works simply for its camp value, the script isn't well written, but hey it's an action flick and you can get away with that. The characters lack any depth, but again for what it's worth War Zone does work due to the camp factor and over the top characters.Director Lexi Alexander is able to create a fun movie with some really silly and over the top action scenes, but rather than being idiotic they work well and are a lot of fun. But she's never able to really bring much depth to the characters and granted War Zone is light on plot and depth of the characters, but Lexi Alexander still could have brought more to the characters. Of course a weak script a director is limited, but a great director can elevate the characters and Lexi Alexander never quite does that, but what she lacks in storytelling skills she makes up for with the action sequences.The pacing of War Zone can be a little sluggish due to the weak plot, but thankfully War Zone is action packed and while Lexi Alexander may not go down as one of the great action directors she does create some really fun action scenes and while War Zone isn't quite a 4-star movie, but due to the fun level I was a little more kind. And the final act is really what bumps it up for me. The final act is violent and bloody and again while Alexander won't go down as one of the greats she does know how to make a fun movie.Ray Stevenson replaces Tom Jane in the role of Frank Castle and at first I sort of lost interest and the first trailer released on the Net didn't change my mind seeing as it looked like something that would air on the Sci-Fi network. But I gotta say Ray Stevenson was excellent as Frank Castle. As far as acting goes I have to give the edge to Tom Jane and while Jane did excellent with the action scenes I think Stevenson might take the edge there and he has the tough guy persona down pat. Between the two it's actually hard to compare since despite being the same character they are very different, but Stevenson was solid in the role, but I'd still give the edge to Tom Jane, but Ray Stevenson does make for a great Frank Castle.The villains were very much comic book villains, which works better in War Zone since it does have that comic book feel so unlike the 2004 version they don't feel out of place. Doug Hutchinson is highly entertaining as Loony Bin Jim, but it's Dominic West as Jigsaw that makes War Zone so fun. It's quite clear Dominic West was having a lot of fun in the role of Jigsaw and delivers an excellent and campy performance. War Zone is meant to be a bit campy and the actors never really play it too straight, which obviously was the right move.I'm not really into comic books despite being a fan of a lot of the movies, but the main selling point for me is that I love vigilante flicks. Even poor ones I seem to enjoy and what I love about The Punisher is Frank Castle is a regular guy. He doesn't have any superpowers and is a tragic character. Again unlike the 2004 version the makers never really tap into that, but it still works well.Too bad War Zone was such a box office disaster since odds are this will be the last we see of Frank Castle on the big screen for quite sometime. By no means is Punisher: War Zone a good movie and really is one of those so bad it's good movies, but War Zone is a hell of a lot of fun with enough wild and crazy action sequences to keep the viewer entertained. And while I had my doubts about Ray Stevenson he ended up being excellent in the role and even though I do prefer Tom Jane, Stevenson makes the role his own and makes for a great replacement. This movie is meant for action movie buffs and fans of the comic the rest should probably avoid.As for the Blu-ray the transfer is excellent and the sound quality is also great. The features are the same as the DVD and they were alright. Nothing really great, but the transfer of the BD more than makes up for the weak extras.",4,One of the so bad it's good movies,1237334400,"03 18, 2009",2009,6253,"['PUNISHER', 'WAR', 'ZONE****',

1230432,A1FJ4WAOIDPEF4,B001QB9H1U,David J. Brown,"[5, 7]","I DON'T DO PLOT SYNOPSIS....just deal with it.My title for this review is actually not a swipe.  I basically liked the first Punisher film.  It was simplistic, stupid, overly violent, depthless and action packed.  It was a great B movie that was unashamed of what it was or what type of films it was emulating.  Sure, the original Punisher comics from the 70's were actually really good, fairly intelligent more adult fair to come out of Marvel comics, similar to what DC did with Swamp Thing(love to get my hands on the rights to that comic and do the ultimate ADULT movie using one or a bunch of the graphic novels as source material).  As far as the Lungren Punisher flick, I'm not going to over-praise it or give it a 5, how could I when the nadir the movie wanted was so shallow, but it did what it set out to do.  As does the latest and third incarnation of the Punisher, PUNISHER: WAR ZONE.I really liked the Thomas Jane Punisher.  Sure, they changed a lot of the origin.  I did think it was over-the-top that the villains of the film murdered Frank Castle's ENTIRE family, we're talking generations at a family reunion here, but the film worked.  Its style was based in the old exploitation revenge flicks of the 70's.  It had all practical effects and stunts and a very compelling performance by the lead.  Again, nothing to go nuts over, but it worked.  It stands as the most dramatically satisfying of the three Punisher films made thus far.Now on to PUNISHER: WAR ZONE.  I think this film was made in the late 80's and accidentally got dumped in Doc Brown's time machine.  It arrived here and was put in the multiplexes.  This movie wreaks of 80's action movie excesses.  This is a good thing, mind you.  I haven't read a Punisher comic since War Journal back in the early 90's, so I can't say how close this hues to the current Punisher character, but I'm told this is pretty much a direct adaption of the comic with the same name.  With the exception of the Jigsaw's brother and some minor details here and there it's basically the same as the comic.  I even did some minor research, some of the shots are colored and framed to panels from the book ala Sin City, Watchmen and 300.  Pretty nifty...if your a salivatig fan boy who's only criteria for how good this film is is that it looks like the comic, the story is the same as the comic, and things blow up real good in it.  Oh, and it's super gory.  I mean really gory...just like old 80's action flicks along the lines of Commando.The problem with this flick is simple.  When things or people aren't getting shot or blown up in front of you, you simply just don't care about the people involved or the plot.  It's totally forgettable outside the violence.  This shocked me a bit.  The director is Lexi Alexander.  She is an ex-stuntwoman who previously directed the very good Greenstreet Hooligans with Elijah Wood.  It was action packed and had depth.  It was like a British version Mean Streets, you know, with Futball.  She's very talented and she must be praised for the polish and strict way her Punisher sticks to its chosen source material.  Here's the thing, MOVIES ARE MOVIES and COMICS ARE COMICS.  They are different mediums, hence why they have two different titles to describe them.  I'm sure this story and imagery jumped off the page, but on the film it just comes off hollow.The acting....wait, there really isn't any.  Ray Stevens has nothing to do in this flick.  The only good or interesting anti-hero sentiments he spouts are, apparently, lines taken from the book.  All the other characters are forgettable and are not something I imagine the actors involved will be putting on their future resumes.  Except Dominic West...he's awful in this film.  I was excited to hear he was in it and playing a villain.  His work in other films like 300 and 28 days is excellent, not to mention his t.v. show The Wire.  He is sooo over the top, and everyone else is sooo somber that it just sticks out like a sore thumb, or in this movie's case a severed thumb.  Yes, I get it, he's nuts.  Who knows what a man disfigured in the manner he was would act, but I still have to buy it in the context of the film it's in, and I didn't.  It's laughable, from his bad Italian mafioso accent, to his over gesturing body movements.  He has one blackly funny scene where he is recruiting gang members, and the director takes a que from Patton for the visuals.The film even has a cloying child to push undeserved sympathy from the more simple minded amongst movie goers.  I see it all the time, especially on internet reviews.  Any time a kid is in a film you can expect on thing to be said, ""(insert child star name here) was brilliant!""  How is a child actor brilliant?  They're playing a child.  Most actors have to tap into a child-like mentality to do what they have to do, so what makes a child who is already, you know, a child so brilliant?  Anyway, there's some great scenes, and by great I mean vomit inducing, with Punisher getting his hand grabbed by cloying child asking him not to leave.  Why?  She doesn't know him.  He's pretty scary and imposing.  He seems to always carry guns, and his arrival into her life brings violence.  Whatever.  It's a cheap and fast way to derive sympathy...well, if you don't expect much anyway.  Hate it.The action scenes are funny and super gory.  It's not disturbingly gory, but over the top rediculously gory.  I'm sure it's all done with tongue firmly planted in cheek, or at least I hope.  There's one great scene where the Punisher goes to an allie's home to find his friend's dead mother.  Not just dead, but half her face blow off, completely.  I felt bad, but this shot made me chuckle.  What other emotion could it possibly solicit?  It's too over the top to be dramatic, and the way the corpse is revealed is funny.Bottom line, if you liked Dolph's Punisher, you'll like this.  If you hated the Thomas Jane Punisher, you'll love this, and somehow feel vindicated by the mere fact that it's more violent and gory.  Somehow that became more important to this character's core then actually making him interesting.  Finally, if you hated the Dolph Punisher because, GASPS, they didn't have him wear a skull on his shirt, you'll love this.  It's the same stupid movie, but with a skull imprinted on his bullet proof vest.  Now keep it in your pants fan boys.  We both know what a pain it is to continually change your shorts.I basically liked it but only on its silly, over-the-top, it's soooo bad it's kind of good level.  Just like the first Punisher film.The dvd is a let down.  The only good special feature is the commentary by the director of photography and the director.  It's funny and fairly informative.  The featurettes, are just that.  They're not very involving and each only runs a bit under or over ten minutes.  The only one that stands out, and it's the shortest, was the one about how they created the Jiggsaw make-up and an interview with Dominci West.  The picture and sound is great.  Not a lot of grain on the very darkly lit picture.A solid rental for all.  A must have and make love to for fan boys.  An avoid at all costs for anyone who thinks fake looking gore is disturbing, or graphic violence on any level makes a bad movie.  That's it.  Class dismissed.",3,Basically works on the same level as the Dolph Lungren version from the 80's.,1237593600,"03 21, 2009",2009,7302,"['DO', ""N'T"", 'DO', 'PLOT', 'SYNOPSIS', '.just', 'deal',

1230442,A24WJULX7UOLFB,B001QB9H1U,"F. Jury ""dsunglasses""","[3, 5]","I'm a big fan of the Punisher, and vigilantes in general. The Punisher was always my favorite comic book. I always liked its gritty realism. The Punisher didn't take prisoners; he didn't let the bad guys go. He was dark and tormented, unflinching when he doled out punishment, but ultimately he was one of the good guys.Unfortunately this isn't a good movie. While it's better then the B movie 80's version, almost anything on film is. I personally found the 04 version to be a much better movie.In the 04 version, there was a more coherent story with better acting, better music, and much more believable action. In the 04 version, I thought Thomas Jane nailed the part, he looked and sounded like the Punisher. There was a sort of Punisher music theme, which fit the character, and the movie managed, to be a good blend of action, humor and dark drama. Thomas Jane appears to have been right to pull out of a sequel for script problems. Its too bad though, I would have liked to have seen T. Jane in a sequel. Yes, the movie got a little silly with him moving fire hydrants around and such, but overall I liked the movie.This version, screams B movie and plays like a B movie. I don't mind the violence and gore, they are fitting for the character. It's the story and acting that are weak. The characters are one dimensional, and the fighting/shooting scenes get to be ridiculous and far fetched. I mean, seriously, who hangs upside down from a chandelier and spins around in the middle of a gunfight? And why?And yet another origin story? There are hundreds of Punisher comics, cant they use one as the basis for a sequel if they are incapable of coming up with a plot on their own?I thought Ray Stevenson did a fair job, looking the part, though his accent didn't really help. I liked the inclusion of micro chip, and Wayne Knight is probably the best actor in the movie, but he was underutilized. If you didn't read the comic books, you really didn't know who ""micro"" was.The idea of a Punisher task force hunting him, was a good and realistic touch, but again, it was regulated to the background story and given no focus.

1230443,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B001QB9H1U,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[1, 1]","PUNISHER WARZONEI have been a fan of Marvel Comics since forever and The Punisher has always been one of my favorite characters of all time. I probably am one of the few people that says they have enjoyed all three of the Punisher films but it is the truth, every one of them have been entertaining in my book. In fact if you were to put the three together you would most likely have the greatest movie ever made, think about it. If you took the atmosphere of the first film and added in the acting of the second and mixed in the violence of this one you would have the perfect movie. To me at least that sounds like the perfect movie or at least the perfect Punisher movie.So after the second film which most people think of as the first film I was excited to say the least when a sequel was announced. But I soon was worried when I learned that Thomas Jade had puller out of the next film, I guess it won't be the same. Luckily for me when we watched this movie it turned out to be a wonderfully violent film that had us all cheering for every death [that sounds weird]. Don't get me wrong there are things one could look at that would rate this film lower but if you go in just wanting to be entertained then this is a winner on all fronts.It has been years since Frank Castle has lost his family and he has crime in fear and the police kinda on his side. Now Frank has his sights set on a meeting were a few criminals are laying around, it is here that he kills an undercover officer mistaking him for one of the criminals. It is also on this night that the Punisher knocks Billy Russoti into a glass grinder, he becomes Jigsaw [character existed before the Saw series]. Naturally after surviving the glass and such he is no longer Billy the Beaut so he is on a mission to kill The Punisher. So he makes his way to an asylum to free his brother Loony Bin Jim, and that name is very much appropriate for him. He also enlists the help of basically every criminal in the city to help him in his quest to kill Castle. From hostages to gunfire to gore this film is fun for the whole family.Director Lexi Alexander and writers Nick Santora, Art Marcum, and  Matt Holloway did the smart thing in my opinion and basically create the Punisher film that every fan wants, and bloody, gritty, dark action flick. Sure there are things that could have been done better but personally the look and feel of this film very much fits the comics, especially the Marvel Knights series in which this is based. I like the way that they were not afraid to get a little gory with this film, there is a lot of well placed blood in this film. Also I am insanely happy that Jigsaw was the villain in this film, Punisher's top enemy in my opinion [or at least my favorite].Ray Stevenson was great as The Punisher as he fit the attitude, look, and over all demeanor of the comic character. To be honest he looks a lot like the comic character so much that he could be the covers of an issue from now on. Dominic West is delightfully and playfully evil in this film as Jigsaw, and Doug Hutchison was wonderfully violent as his brother Loony Bin Jim. My boy Dash Mihok is good in this as is Wayne Knight, Julie Benz and Stephanie Janusauskas are good in this as well.This movie is a great way to spend a Friday or Saturday night especially with friends watching with eating pizza and such [great night]. Go into this with the brain shut off and ready to be entertained and I know you will enjoy it. Sure this is not the greatest movie ever made but man is it a fun one.There is some great special features including a nice audio commentary.",5,WONDERFULLY VIOLENT - SHUT YOUR BRAIN OFF AND BE ENTERTAINED,1243209600,"05 25, 2009",2009,3613,"['PUNISHER', 'WARZONEI', 'have', 'been', 'fan', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'forever', 'Punisher', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'characters', 'time', 'probably', 'am', 'one', 'few', 'people', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'three', 'Punisher', 'films', 'truth', 'one', 'have', 'been', 'entertaining', 'book', 'fact', 'were', 'put', 'three', 'together', 'would', 'most', 'likely', 'have', 'greatest', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'think', 'took', 'atmosphere', 'first', 'film', 'added', 'acting', 'second', 'mixed', 'violence', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'perfect', 'movie', 'least', 'perfect', 'movie', 'least', 'perfect', 'Punisher', 'movie.So', 'second', 'film', 'most', 'people', 'think', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'excited', 'say', 'least', 'when', 'sequel', 'was', 'announced', 'soon', 'was', 'worried', 'when', 'learned', 'Thomas', 'Jade', 'had', 'puller', 'next', 'film', 'guess', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'same', 'Luckily', 'when', 'watched', 'movie', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'wonderfully', 'violent', 'film', 'had', 'all', 'cheering', 'death', '[', 'weird', ']', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'are', 'things', 'one', 'could', 'look', 'would', 'rate', 'film', 'lower', 'go', 'just', 'wanting', 'be', 'entertained', 'then', 'winner', 'fronts.It', 'been', 'years', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'lost', 'family', 'crime', 'fear', 'police', 'kinda', 'side', 'Now', 'Frank', 'sights', 'set', 'meeting', 'were', 'few', 'criminals', 'are', 'laying', 'around', 'here', 'undercover', 'officer', 'mistaking', 'one', 'criminals', 'also', 'night', 'Punisher', 'knocks', 'Billy', 'Russoti', 'glass', 'grinder', 'Jigsaw', '[', 'character', 'existed', 'Saw', 'series', ']', 'Naturally', 'surviving', 'glass', 'such', 'no', 'longer', 'Billy', 'Beaut', 'mission', 'kill', 'Punisher', 'way', 'asylum', 'free', 'brother', 'Loony', 'Bin', 'Jim', 'name', 'very', 'much', 'appropriate', 'also', 'help', 'basically', 'criminal', 'city', 'help', 'quest', 'kill', 'Castle', 'hostages', 'gunfire', 'gore', 'film', 'fun', 'whole', 'family.Director', 'Lexi', 'Alexander', 'writers', 'Nick', 'Santora', 'Art', 'Marcum', 'Matt', 'Holloway', 'did', 'smart', 'thing', 'opinion', 'basically', 'create', 'Punisher', 'film', 'fan', 'bloody', 'gritty', 'dark', 'action', 'flick', 'Sure', 'are', 'things', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'better', 'personally', 'look', 'feel', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'comics', 'especially', 'Marvel', 'Knights', 'series', 'based', 'way', 'were', 'not', 'afraid', 'get', 'little', 'gory', 'film', 'lot', 'well', 'placed', 'blood', 'film', 'Also', 'am', 'insanely', 'happy', 'Jigsaw', 'was', 'villain', 'film', 'Punisher', 'top', 'enemy', 'opinion', '[', 'least', 'favorite', ']', '.Ray', 'Stevenson', 'was', 'great', 'Punisher', 'attitude', 'look', 'demeanor', 'comic', 'character', 'be', 'honest', 'lot', 'comic', 'character', 'so', 'much', 'could', 'be', 'covers', 'issue', 'now', 'Dominic', 'West', 'delightfully', 'playfully', 'evil', 'film', 'Jigsaw', 'Doug', 'Hutchison', 'was', 'wonderfully', 'violent', 'brother', 'Loony', 'Bin', 'Jim', 'boy', 'Dash', 'Mihok', 'good', 'Wayne', 'Knight', 'Julie', 'Benz', 'Stephanie', 'Janusauskas', 'are', 'good', 'well.This', 'movie', 'great', 'way', 'spend', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'night', 'especially', 'friends', 'watching', 'eating', 'pizza', 'such', '[', 'great', 'night', ']', 'Go', 'brain', 'shut', 'off', 'ready', 'be', 'entertained', 'know', 'will', 'enjoy', 'Sure', 'not', 'greatest', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'man', 'fun', 'great', 'special', 'features', 'including', 'nice', 'audio', 'commentary']",N/A

1230447,A34OB3QSRG4XOO,B001QB9H1U,"G. Chance ""deathiswatching""","[0, 1]","First, the movie.  IMO, this is the first Punisher movie to really stick to the roots of the source material.  I am a huge fan of the last movie and admit was disappointed to hear of the casting change, but, for this movie, Thomas Jane just would not have fit.  This movie is an action filled blood-bath from start to finish while still managing a decent story.  Unlike Jane's Punisher, this one has been fighting the good fight for several years now and has been hardened.  If you are evil, you will die, no hesitation, no remorse, just as the character should be.This is a great example of what an action movie of today should be.  Many have tried to get here, but most fail.  What sets this movie apart are the fight scenes.  Like most ""R"" action movies, the scenes are incredibly brutal, fast, and bloody.  However, where most action movies of today use cuts so fast that you can't even tell what is going on, this movies slows it down in just the right places to see all the brutal glory in perfect detail.  As noted, there is a lot of violence, almost non-stop from beginning to end, but it is done in such a unique way that I never got bored with it.  Many moves bombard you with so much of the same that you just get tired of it all, instead I was hoping for more just to see what would come next.The only critique I have of the move is the casting choices for the bad guys, while Jigsaw is pretty good, I could never really see his brother for the crazed cannibal he was supposed to be.  I did like the lackeys though, good comic relief there, while they lived, lol.As for the Blu-ray itself, it has a very good picture and an excellent soundtrack.  If you have a decent surround sound system, you will feel right in the middle of the action.  Crisp, clean visuals, even when the action is at its fastest (I saw more this viewing than in the theater in fact).  The extras are good too, but I'm one who buys Blu-ray for the picture and sound, you can read about the extras on the main page.For any action fan, this is a must-have.My 2",5,"A Ballet of Violence, in High-Def!",1238889600,"04 5, 2009",2009,2042,"['First', 'movie', 'IMO', 'first', 'Punisher', 'movie', 'really', 'stick', 'roots', 'source', 'material', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'last', 'movie', 'admit', 'was', 'disappointed', 'hear', 'casting', 'change', 'movie', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'just', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'fit', 'movie', 'action', 'filled', 'blood-bath', 'start', 'finish', 'still', 'managing', 'decent', 'story', 'Jane', 'Punisher', 'one', 'been', 'fighting', 'good', 'fight', 'several', 'years', 'now', 'been', 'hardened', 'are', 'evil', 'will', 'die', 'hesitation', 'remorse', 'just', 'character', 'should', 'be.This', 'great', 'example', 'what', 'action', 'movie', 'today', 'should', 'be', 'Many', 'have', 'tried', 'get', 'here', 'most', 'fail', 'What', 'movie', 'apart', 'are', 'fight', 'scenes', 'most', 'R', 'action', 'movies', 'scenes', 'are', 'incredibly', 'brutal', 'fast', 'bloody', 'However', 'where', 'most', 'action', 'movies', 'today', 'use', 'cuts', 'so', 'fast', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'tell', 'what', 'going', 'movies', 'down', 'just', 'right', 'places', 'see', 'brutal', 'glory', 'perfect', 'detail', 'noted', 'lot', 'violence', 'almost', 'non-stop', 'beginning', 'end', 'done', 'such', 'unique', 'way', 'never', 'got', 'bored', 'Many', 'moves', 'so', 'much', 'same', 'just', 'get', 'tired', 'instead', 'was', 'hoping', 'more', 'just', 'see', 'what', 'would', 'come', 'only', 'critique', 'have', 'move', 'casting', 'choices', 'bad', 'guys', 'Jigsaw', 'pretty', 'good', 'could', 'never', 'really', 'see', 'brother', 'crazed', 'cannibal', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'did', 'lackeys', 'good', 'comic', 'relief', 'there', 'lived', 'lol.As', 'Blu-ray', 'very', 'good', 'picture', 'excellent', 'soundtrack', 'have', 'decent', 'surround', 'sound', 'system', 'will', 'feel', 'right', 'middle', 'action', 'Crisp', 'clean', 'visuals', 'even', 'when', 'action', 'fastest', 'saw', 'more', 'viewing', 'theater', 'fact', 'extras', 'are', 'good', 'too', ""'m"", 'one', 'who', 'Blu-ray', 'picture', 'sound', 'can', 'read', 'extras', 'main', 'page.For', 'action', 'fan', 'must-have.My', '2']",N/A

Frank is mortified when he accidentally kills a cop to the point he's going to quit being the Punisher yet he has no problem shooting one of the bad guys in the face -after the badguy was subdued disarmed and handcuffed.The cinematography in this film is really beautiful, it has a really wonderful rich use of color that almost feels like a richly illustrated graphic novel.The special effects are well executed and uses what appears to be real physical effects for the most part.Overall very well done and worth watching",5,Nearly flawless,1385596800,"11 28, 2013",2013,1066,"['film', 'feel', 'Punisher', 'comics', 'nearly', 'perfectly', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'aka', 'Punisher', 'maniac', 'Spider', 'Man', 'other', 'super', 'heroes', 'often', 'hunted', 'Punisher', 'were', 'often', 'deeply', 'troubled', 'Punisher', 'behavior', ""'In"", 'film', 'really', 'get', 'sense', 'Frank', 'unstable', 'own', 'bizarre', 'sense', 'morality', 'will', 'find', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'guy', 'head', 'punisher', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'dialogue', 'film', 'what', 'said', 'character', 'perfectly', 'Frank', 'mortified', 'when', 'accidentally', 'cop', 'point', 'going', 'quit', 'being', 'Punisher', 'yet', 'problem', 'shooting', 'one', 'bad', 'guys', 'face', '-after', 'badguy', 'was', 'subdued', 'disarmed', 'handcuffed.The', 'cinematography', 'film', 'really', 'beautiful', 'really', 'wonderful', 'rich', 'use', 'color', 'almost', 'feels', 'richly', 'illustrated', 'graphic', 'novel.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'well', 'executed', 'what', 'be', 'real', 'physical', 'effects', 'most', 'part.Overall', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A
1230454,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B001QB9H1U,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","PUNISHER: WAR ZONE is... as subtle as a chop to the Adam's apple, as bleak as a 14th Century pandemic. If you know, going in, what the Punisher is all about, then you won't be too shocked by the film's dark tone and overt, gory violence. Created in the mold of Mack Bolan the Executioner, the Punisher has always been one of the most brutal anti-heroes in the Marvel universe. Frank Castle, from the moment his family was mercilessly butchered, stopped giving an eff about sunshiny things like hope and optimism and justice as served up by the law. As an urban vigilante, the Punisher tops even the Batman in doling out sheer intimidation and vicious follow-thru on threats. Villains know that Batman won't kill, but that there's a chance the Punisher might not only slap you around silly, but then, afterwards, murderize you, too. Understand that the Punisher's sole purpose now is to eradicate as much two-legged scum as he can off the face of the planet.The skimpy plot revolves around a shipment of biological weapons, an assortment of mobsters, and the emergence of Jigsaw - a hood formerly absorbed with his dandy looks until a glass-crunching machine had its way with him - and Jigsaw's brother, the psychotic ""Loony Bin"" Jim. The movie also tries to lend Frank Castle added depth and dimension, but it does it in a half-hearted fashion. The film has the Punisher undergoing a crisis of conscience (he inadvertently causes the death of an undercover FBI agent) and, as a humanizing element, has him bonding with a little girl. Except that all this feels contrived. Or maybe I'm just not used to seeing a guilt-ridden Frank Castle suddenly contemplating the notion of giving up on his mission.But I'll say this: Of the three films thus far, PUNISHER: WAR ZONE is the closest adaptation of the comic book Punisher. Ray Stevenson, despite his one-note acting, not only is the grimmest Punisher yet but he also bears a likeness to Tim Bradstreet's iconic Punisher illustrations, which lends Stevenson a measure of street cred with me. Chances are those who haven't picked up the comics will condemn this movie as soulless and gratuitous. But I say it's pretty much on the money with regards to Castle's persona and the hopeless world he inhabits. But the acting could be better. I mentioned that Stevenson's acting is one-note, but I'd also like to add that Dominic West as Jigsaw and Doug Hutchison as ""Loony Bin"" Jim turn in ridiculously over-the-top performances.Longtime fans of the Punisher can look forward to several Easter eggs within the film, of which the most obvious is perhaps the ""Brad Street Hotel."" Characters from the comic book show up, such as Microchip and Martin Soap and, of course, Jigsaw. So far, it seems like I've been dogging this movie more so than not, but I did like it enough to rate it 3 stars out of 5, mostly because I dug the exploitation-type action and violence, even though the film falls down on things like acting, storytelling, and character development. Frank Castle has never been one of my preferred Marvel heroes, but there's no denying the man can throw down. I came in to this, anticipating scenes of this sort: a wineglass getting shoved thru a guy's throat and a chair leg punching thru a guy's eye. And, no, there's not much humor here, but I did laugh out loud when a parkour practitioner unexpectedly gets taken out in mid-leap. And, for all the dispensable henchmen and extras in horror or suspense cinema, upon hearing some unidentified noise, are there words more dreaded from the boss than ""Go check it out.""? It's the verbal version of the red Starfleet uniform.You say this film is disheartening and callous and nasty and grim? I say, all those traits define the Punisher. PUNISHER: WAR ZONE captures the essence of Frank Castle. I've always thought him this poor nutter who's given up on life and who now lives only to punish the criminal element. There's no happy place in the Punisher's universe.

Granted, I think this one is the best of the three that they've done. Everybody always hangs the Dolph Lundgren as being the worst of the previous two, but I personally think the Thomas Jane edition from four years ago was serious lacking.Anyways, in this one, it's a complete reboot of the storyline, totally ignoring the previous films(much to the delight of sarcastic fanboys everywhere). This movie takes the story to New York where ex-cop Frank Castle has been going on a killing spree for the last five years as a vigilante. After taking down most of the bigwigs in the largest Italian mafia family in town, he sets his sights on the remaining members who're doing a shipment with some Russians. Punisher steps in and stops them, but accidently kills an FBI agent there. During the raid, Billy ""The Beaut"" is horribly scarred, and re-emerges as the villian Jigsaw. Jigsaw busts his crazy-ass brother, Looney Bin Jim, out of the nuthouse to get revenge on Castle, and gain back what money he's lost.Punisher spends too much of the movie worrying about the family of the FBI agent he whacked, and the stereotypical daughter who is the only one who sees the good in him is the most overused ploy in any of these misunderstood vigilante movies. I thought I was watching Darkman 3 there for a few minutes! There's also the overused criminal killer going to the church to get redemption stock footage. Didn't Daredevil aready cover this? Why do all these Marvel Comics movies have to have a scene in a New York church? Even Incredible Hulk had one!Dominic West plays a pretty good Jigsaw. He definately wins for third best movie supervillian of 2008. At least they finally used one of the more generic Punisher villains instead of just some Godfather reject. Wayne Knight was also good casting as Microchip. The director probably went, ""Oh, just get the fat dude from Seinfeld.""Punisher's actual ""punishing"" is a little better in this one. Instead of the last one where he kept egging on the hoods to kill each other off, he just takes them out himself. I dunno how he managed to walk around town with about twenty bazookas strapped to his back, and at least not get any fallen arches. But he just brutalizes dudes in this one.If you wanna see a reasonably decent adaption of a Marvel Comics title, then this is pretty good.

Punisher was previously portrayed byDolph Lundgrenin 1989 andThomas Janein 2004. This time around Ray Stevenson is Frank Castle, a.k.a. Punisher, facing off against a mobster named Billy Russoti.In an homage to another famous comic book origin, whenBatmandropped the Joker into a vat of chemicals, the Punisher drops Russoti into a glass-crushing machine, creating the villian Jigsaw. Buried beneath a mask of scar tissue is Dominic West, best known for his portrayal of Detective Jimmy McNulty inThe Wire. Ironically, West also had a minor role in300, which was infamous its gory violence, too.West and Doug Hutchison (who plays Jigsaw's brother, James Russoti) give an over-the-top performance that channels Anthony Hopkins'Dr. Hannibal Lecterand Robert De Niro'sMax Cady.In summary, while this is the best adaptation yet, the film won't attract much of an audience beyond die-hard fans.

1230465,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B001QB9H1U,J from NY,"[0, 0]","There really isn't a whole lot you can do with the story of ""The Punisher"".  Having read the comics since I was a kid, even they seemed to get tiring after awhile plotwise.Frank Castle is a thirtysomething vigilante whose family was executed by a group of mobsters after accidentally overhearing the details of a planned hit.  Ray Stevenson does a way better job than Thomas Jane (which isn't necessarily saying much) in terms of giving some flesh and blood to this otherwise one dimensional character.  His performance is by turns haunting and vicious.The brutality in this film did not shock me because it's pretty predictable.  The Punisher hears about a mob meeting.  The Punisher shows up and wastes everybody there, accidentally disfiguring Dominic West, the head honcho of the most powerful mob family in the city.  Or country.  The locale is never specified.What's sort of unbelievable about the whole thing is that Castle's head is always exposed.  He twirls from chandeliers blasting away at the enemy, continually trying to satisfy himself that he has finally gotten the most evil one of them all, and his HEAD IS ALWAYS EXPOSED.  Would the ingenious idea ever occur to one of these mafia guys to aim accordingly?  Apparently not.Doug Hutchinson is the best bad guy around these days.  His performance in ""The Salton Sea"", another and far superior revenge film gave me that idea.  He plays the insane cannibal brother of West's character, and he is genuinely frightening.While this film definitely has a mood and ambiance to it that better delivers the paradoxes of Frank Castle (he finds himself in a moral catch 22 when he accidentally kills an undercover FBI agent), these kind of movies always say the same thing.  The same kind of conservative philosophy that produced ""Death Wish"", etc.  The only logical ending for a criminal life is vigilante death and justice.  This, of course, is absolute nonsense.  It is revealed at one point that Castle had thought about the seminary after being a marine.  He enters a Church to reflect.  The priest behaves like some naive child, terrified of him though he knew him at one point personally.  Completely unrealistic.This is worth a watch for real Punisher fans, though the philosophy behind the comic and the character is simply erroneous.",3,Deeper into Frank Castle's compromised psyche,1242864000,"05 21, 2009",2009,2298,"['really', ""n't"", 'whole', 'lot', 'can', 'do', 'story', 'Punisher', 'Having', 'read', 'comics', 'was', 'kid', 'even', 'seemed', 'get', 'tiring', 'awhile', 'plotwise.Frank', 'Castle', 'thirtysomething', 'vigilante', 'family', 'was', 'executed', 'group', 'mobsters', 'accidentally', 'overhearing', 'details', 'planned', 'hit', 'Ray', 'Stevenson', 'way', 'better', 'job', 'Thomas', 'Jane', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'saying', 'much', 'terms', 'giving', 'flesh', 'blood', 'otherwise', 'one', 'dimensional', 'character', 'performance', 'turns', 'haunting', 'vicious.The', 'brutality', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'shock', 'pretty', 'predictable', 'Punisher', 'mob', 'meeting', 'Punisher', 'up', 'everybody', 'there', 'accidentally', 'disfiguring', 'Dominic', 'West', 'head', 'honcho', 'most', 'powerful', 'mob', 'family', 'city', 'country', 'locale', 'never', 'specified.What', 'sort', 'unbelievable', 'whole', 'thing', 'Castle', 'head', 'always', 'exposed', 'chandeliers', 'blasting', 'away', 'enemy', 'continually', 'trying', 'satisfy', 'finally', 'gotten', 'most', 'evil', 'one', 'HEAD', 'IS', 'ALWAYS', 'EXPOSED', 'Would', 'ingenious', 'idea', 'ever', 'occur', 'one', 'mafia', 'guys', 'aim', 'accordingly', 'Apparently', 'not.Doug', 'Hutchinson', 'best', 'bad', 'guy', 'days', 'performance', 'Salton', 'Sea', 'far', 'superior', 'revenge', 'film', 'gave', 'idea', 'insane', 'brother', 'West', 'character', 'genuinely', 'frightening.While', 'film', 'definitely', 'mood', 'ambiance', 'better', 'delivers', 'paradoxes', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'moral', 'catch', '22', 'when', 'accidentally', 'undercover', 'FBI', 'agent', 'kind', 'movies', 'always', 'say', 'same', 'thing', 'same', 'kind', 'conservative', 'philosophy', 'produced', 'Death', 'Wish', 'etc', 'only', 'logical', 'ending', 'criminal', 'life', 'vigilante', 'death', 'justice', 'course', 'absolute', 'nonsense', 'revealed', 'one', 'point', 'Castle', 'had', 'thought', 'seminary', 'being', 'marine', 'Church', 'reflect', 'priest', 'behaves', 'naive', 'child', 'terrified', 'knew', 'one', 'point', 'personally', 'Completely', 'unrealistic.This', 'watch', 'real', 'Punisher', 'fans', 'philosophy', 'comic', 'character', 'simply', 'erroneous']",N/A

Jigsaw then recruits all the criminals in New York from Russians,Triads,Skinheads,Blacks,Hispanics to put a bounty on the Punisher.Compared to the Thomas Jane movie this one lacks in dialogue but most have seen both prior Punisher movies and read the comic books so they have an idea of his origin.The most annoying character in the movie has got to be Loony Bin Jim (Doug Hutchison. He tries extremely hard to be very sarcastic and loony.There is a lot of comedy as well with the villains having fun and destroying everything in their path instead of being coldlblooded one dimensional killers.The budget for this movie was 35 million and was used very well.Unfortunately the actors are unknown and the movie had very few advertising.The movie did not make even half of its budget back,but with dvd sales and streaming online it has gotten the recognition.If you are a Punisher fan this one you will like it is more like the comic book.The director is a female and proves that she can direct a great action movie.Hopefully she'll get more work in the future.",4,Great Fun,1337817600,"05 24, 2012",2012,1872,"['third', 'adaptation', 'Punisher.Now', 'place', 'New', 'York', 'City.It', 'directed', 'Lexi', 'Alexander', 'stars', 'Ray', 'Stevenson', 'Dominic', 'West', 'Colin', 'Salmon', 'Julie', 'Benz', 'Wayne', 'Knight.This', 'straight', 'up', 'action', 'movie', 'sorts', 'weapons', 'Punisher', 'comic', 'books', 'PS2', 'game.He', 'brutal', 'see', 'not', 'hold', 'back.The', 'villains', 'are', 'once', 'again', 'Italian', 'mob', 'bit', 'cartoonish', 'ones', 'vampire', 'movie', 'Innocent', 'Blood.Punisher', 'nemesis', 'former', 'crime', 'lord', 'was', 'disfigured', 'known', 'Jigsaw.Jigsaw', 'brother', 'insane', 'asylum', 'get', 'revenge', 'Punisher', 'mob.One', 'Jigsaw', 'crew', 'members', 'Nicky', 'was', 'undercover', 'killed', 'Punisher.The', 'Punisher', 'later', 'out', 'was', 'fed', 'pays', 'respect', 'wife', 'daughter', 'Jigsaw', 'then', 'criminals', 'New', 'York', 'Russians', 'Triads', 'Skinheads', 'Blacks', 'Hispanics', 'put', 'bounty', 'Punisher.Compared', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'movie', 'one', 'dialogue', 'most', 'have', 'seen', 'prior', 'Punisher', 'movies', 'read', 'comic', 'books', 'have', 'idea', 'origin.The', 'most', 'annoying', 'character', 'movie', 'got', 'be', 'Loony', 'Bin', 'Jim', 'Doug', 'Hutchison', 'extremely', 'hard', 'be', 'very', 'sarcastic', 'lot', 'comedy', 'well', 'villains', 'having', 'fun', 'destroying', 'everything', 'path', 'instead', 'being', 'coldlblooded', 'one', 'dimensional', 'killers.The', 'budget', 'movie', 'was', '35', 'million', 'was', 'used', 'very', 'well.Unfortunately', 'actors', 'are', 'unknown', 'movie', 'had', 'very', 'few', 'advertising.The', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'even', 'half', 'budget', 'back', 'dvd', 'sales', 'streaming', 'online', 'gotten', 'recognition.If', 'are', 'Punisher', 'fan', 'one', 'will', 'like', 'more', 'comic', 'book.The', 'director', 'female', 'can', 'direct', 'great', 'action', 'movie.Hopefully', ""'ll"", 'get', 'more', 'work', 'future']",N/A

I decided to purchase this DVD featuring this anti-hero.  One of the many things I like about the Punisher as compared to other Marvel Super heroes, is that he does not have any  &#34;super powers&#34; and must use his own naturally developed skills that he learned as a former Special Forces Officer to battle the bad guys.  The Punisher is an expert with all kinds of guns and knives as he hunts down the mob predators.This film starts off with a shoot out with Frank Castle/The punisher, (played by Ray Stevenson) dealing his kind of justice to a crime family at dinner time no less.  Unfortunately, he also mistakenly kills an FBI undercover agent who infiltrated the mob, who was also at the scene of the shoot-out. The remorse Frank Castle feels for shooting one of the good guys made him depressed as he attempted to make it up to the Agent's family.  In the mean time, one of the gangsters, who was disfigured when he fell into a vat of broken class, seeks vengeance against both the undercover agent's family and Frank Castle.I never like to give too much away and spoil it for someone who has never seen this DVD, but you can be sure the punk gangster  and his gang of predators fooled with the wrong person, as the Punisher does his thing for justice.

1230479,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B001QB9H1U,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[3, 4]","Perhaps there are some comic book characters that just aren't as enticing to moviegoers in the same way as say, Iron Man, Spider-Man, or Batman. In my estimation, Marvel Comics' anti-hero Frank Castle, aka The Punisher, would be one of those characters that only commands a much smaller niche audience than the aforementioned ones. This thought is further supported by the fact that in 1989 the character arrived on the big screen in what could easily be called one of the worst comic book adaptations ever made, not to mention it was just a horrible movie in general. In 2004, the character made a resurgence on the silver screen in a much more faithful and enjoyable adaptation that produced decent numbers (when combining the theatrical and DVD releases), yet still was viewed as a less than stellar release for a Marvel Comics film adaptation. Which brings us to the 2008 release of ""Punisher: War Zone"", the third, and based on the horrible numbers it pulled down at the box office, most likely the final attempt at finding success for the character on the big screen.""Punisher: War Zone"" follows the extreme vigilantism of former Special Forces operative Frank Castle (Ray Stevenson). He is a man whose family was murdered before his eyes, and he now wages a seemingly endless war on the Mafia as the killer of killers known as The Punisher. During his latest mission in his self-declared ""war"", Punisher targets mobster Billy Russoti, and in the process inadvertently finds himself in the middle of an undercover FBI investigation. Due to his interference, along with the ever-increasing body count of Mafia hoods filling city morgues, Punisher finds himself having to elude the law, while trying to finish what he started with the Mob.This latest film iteration of Marvel Comics' skull-clad anti-hero is a mixture of good and bad, resulting in a movie that will miss more moviegoers than it hits. Let's start with what this current adaptation actually did right. As a comic book fan, I found this version of the character was much more accurate to the source material. From the location of the film being set in New York City, the appearance of Ray Stevenson in character looking as if he just walked off the page of the comic, to the inclusion of the characters of Micro and Jigsaw, so many elements within this movie made this the most accurate depiction of the character we've seen, and most likely will ever see on film. The action is fast-paced and very brutal, and at times it can be quite inventive. Plus, I would be remiss if I didn't admit that it is kind of nice seeing such evil people getting their come-uppance.Now, on to where the film went wrong, something that occurred frequently throughout the movie's duration. For starters, why were there so many unnecessary bouts of over-the-top performances that at times wandered over into the despicable realm of camp? Whoever had the idea to give the film's primary villain, Jigsaw, some of the dumbest moments in the film really should have thought twice about it. For me, I find it hard to take a character seriously when he acts so stupid and childish several times over the course of a movie. While on the topic of bad character choices we can't forget to mention that the characters Loony Bin Jim and Detective Soap were two of the most annoying, and utterly pointless characters within the film, and truthfully every time they appeared on-screen the film's standards began to drop even further (not that they were all that high to begin with). I mentioned the action as being a plus; well it's also a minus for this film. This is due to the fact that the action appears to be the only driving force in this movie, the story takes a distant second or maybe even third in the grand scheme of things. While I am a fan of action films, I typically enjoy the ones where the movie doesn't feel like one excessive fight after another. On top of that the violence is extremely gory, not all that big of a deal to me most times, but when I'm not supposed to be watching a horror film I don't expect there to be buckets and buckets of blood being spilled across the screen (to the extreme that would make the most ardent of slasher film fans happy). Lastly, the story, written by Nick Santora (""The Longshots"") and Art Marcum & Matt Holloway (""Iron Man""), is extremely thin and at times finds itself on the verge of becoming non-existent. While it does contain just enough detail to loosely hold everything together, there are too many missed opportunities to capitalize on character development or even just include a slight bit more exposition on how a character knew to do this or that or go here or there. Had the writers gone through the extra effort it would have gone a long way in making this a better film.As for the cast of this film, they may not be the same caliber of talent as most Hollywood A-listers, but they do a decent job with what they've been given. Ray Stevenson (TV's ""Rome""), as I stated earlier, looks just like the character from the comics, and his performance is solid given what little he had to work with. I personally preferred Thomas Jane as the character, he just seemed like a more talented actor, not to mention his whole movie I found better than this one, but Stevenson's interpretation was a close second. Portraying the villainous Jigsaw is actor Dominic West (""300""). So many things went wrong in Dominic's performance, he's over-the-top in most of his scenes, and on top of that his make-up is some of the worst I have seen in a film in quite some time. Honestly, I'm surprised and disappointed that anyone felt that any portion of Jigsaw's character was done correctly as both a fully-developed character and an adaptation.In the area of the supporting characters, actress Julie Benz (""Rambo"") was essentially wasted in her role as a widow to a fallen undercover FBI agent. Julie does a good enough job with the lame story arc that her character is given, but her whole portion of the movie could have been removed, because its only purpose was to make the Punisher appear to have a softer side (which isn't like his comic book counterpart at all). The character of Micro, the weapons supplier for Punisher, as played by Wayne Knight (TV's ""Seinfeld"") was not much more than a cameo, and aside from being a nod to the comic book, he wasn't really all that important to the story as it turns out. Plus, if you aren't familiar with the comic books his involvement with Punisher and importance to him isn't very obvious, so you find yourself wondering, ""Why does Punisher even care about this guy one iota?"" This was just a prime example of how a little bit of character development and/or exposition would have benefited the story.Finally, ""Punisher: War Zone"" isn't a horrible movie, and I would say it falls somewhere in between the 1989 disastrous attempt and the much better 2004 remake. If you are a fan of the character, then you will probably find that this movie is worth watching once, and who knows, you may even enjoy it. Personally, I believe if you took the best parts of the 2004 film and mixed it with the best portions of this one (which only amounts to about 30 or 40 minutes) then you could really have a terrific Punisher movie. That being said, I don't believe there needs to be another movie featuring this anti-hero. I think three is plenty, and since it doesn't appear that they got it perfectly right on any of the attempts, I don't think number four would fare any better.""Punisher: War Zone"" is rated R for

1230480,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B001QB9H1U,K. Driscoll,"[1, 5]","Punisher:  War Zone can be described as bi-polar in both its mood and quality.  It is an action film directed by Lexi Alexander (Green Street Hooligans).  It has a great lead in Ray Stevenson as Frank Castle.  It's not a stretch from his violent and rage-ful role as Titus Pullo on HBO's now cancelled seriesRomebut he still manages to bring some new elements to the table.  His scenes are strong because he can act and for some reason his lines are not nearly as poorly written as the rest of the film.  Dominic West is laughably bad as the film's primary villain Jigsaw and his dialogue is so derivative of other comic book films it is almost shocking.  The only acting worse than his is that of Doug Hutchison as Jigsaw's brother Looney Bin Jim. However, in fairness to Hutchison, the dialogue he has to work with is even worse. The film has some moments that are legitimately good and the action is definitely top notch, especially for those waiting to see the relentless vigilante unleash in incredibly bloody ways.  As a fan of the comic I count myself among those who've waited patiently.For those who don't know, the Punisher is Marvel comic's most prominent anti-hero.  He uses murder as an acceptable measure in fighting crime.  In fairness, his family was murdered by mobsters and his existence is now reduced to a kind of force of nature towards all kinds of criminals he sentences to death.  I like the Punisher as a character but I definitely don't relate to him in the way that some fans do.  I'm more of a Batman or Reed Richards kind of guy.  Here The Punisher is portrayed very true to the comic book character and for many that may be more of a plus than I'm making it out to be.  The plot of Punisher:  War Zone is simple; he's out to kill all of the bad guys.The violence in this film is used effectively at times but for the most part there are no restraints in its more gratuitous uses.  It is a very violent film and at times it's great for that, but I would've preferred more focus on the intriguing Frank Castle character instead.  Also, half of the film is focused on the villains and those scenes are nearly unbearable at times, which are flaws I cannot forgive.  The1989 filmstarring Dolph Lundgren is too easy a target but the2004 filmwith Thomas Jane and John Travolta was in my opinion terrible as well.  So, although it might not be saying much, this is the best Punisher movie so far. I'll give this a recommendation to either those who like the character or those who like violent exploitation kind of films.  I imagine the two camps are one and the same more often than not.",3,Welcome to Hollywood Frank: The New Age of Exploitation Trash,1228694400,"12 8, 2008",2008,2610,"['Punisher', 'War', 'Zone', 'can', 'be', 'described', 'bi-polar', 'mood', 'quality', 'action', 'film', 'directed', 'Lexi', 'Alexander', 'Green', 'Street', 'Hooligans', 'great', 'lead', 'Ray', 'Stevenson', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'not', 'stretch', 'violent', 'rage-ful', 'role', 'Titus', 'Pullo', 'HBO', 'now', 'cancelled', 'seriesRomebut', 'still', 'bring', 'new', 'elements', 'table', 'scenes', 'are', 'strong', 'can', 'act', 'reason', 'lines', 'are', 'not', 'nearly', 'poorly', 'written', 'rest', 'film', 'Dominic', 'West', 'laughably', 'bad', 'film', 'primary', 'villain', 'Jigsaw', 'dialogue', 'so', 'derivative', 'other', 'comic', 'book', 'films', 'almost', 'shocking', 'only', 'acting', 'worse', 'Doug', 'Hutchison', 'Jigsaw', 'brother', 'Looney', 'Bin', 'Jim', 'However', 'fairness', 'Hutchison', 'dialogue', 'work', 'even', 'worse', 'film', 'moments', 'are', 'legitimately', 'good', 'action', 'definitely', 'top', 'notch', 'especially', 'waiting', 'see', 'relentless', 'vigilante', 'unleash', 'incredibly', 'bloody', 'ways', 'fan', 'comic', 'count', 'who', ""'ve"", 'waited', 'patiently.For', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Punisher', 'Marvel', 'comic', 'most', 'prominent', 'anti-hero', 'murder', 'acceptable', 'measure', 'fighting', 'crime', 'fairness', 'family', 'was', 'murdered', 'mobsters', 'existence', 'now', 'reduced', 'kind', 'force', 'nature', 'kinds', 'criminals', 'death', 'Punisher', 'character', 'definitely', 'do', ""n't"", 'relate', 'way', 'fans', 'do', ""'m"", 'more', 'Batman', 'Reed', 'Richards', 'kind', 'guy', 'Here', 'Punisher', 'portrayed', 'very', 'true', 'comic', 'book', 'character', 'many', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'plus', ""'m"", 'making', 'be', 'plot', 'Punisher', 'War', 'Zone', 'simple', 'out', 'kill', 'bad', 'guys.The', 'violence', 'film', 'used', 'effectively', 'times', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'restraints', 'more', 'gratuitous', 'uses', 'very', 'violent', 'film', 'times', 'great', 'would', ""'ve"", 'preferred', 'more', 'focus', 'intriguing', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'character', 'instead', 'Also', 'half', 'film', 'focused', 'villains', 'scenes', 'are', 'nearly', 'unbearable', 'times', 'are', 'flaws', 'can', 'not', 'forgive', 'The1989', 'filmstarring', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'too', 'easy', 'target', 'the2004', 'filmwith', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'John', 'Travolta', 'was', 'opinion', 'terrible', 'as', 'well', 'So', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'saying', 'much', 'best', 'Punisher', 'movie', 'so', 'far', ""'ll"", 'give', 'recommendation', 'who', 'like', 'character', 'who', 'like', 'violent', 'exploitation', 'kind', 'films', 'imagine', 'two', 'camps', 'are', 'one', 'same', 'more', 'often', 'not']",N/A

1230483,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B001QB9H1U,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[8, 8]","While I thoroughly enjoyed Thomas Jane's turn as Frank Castle in 2004's ""The Punisher,"" a part of me wanted the title character to get just a bit nastier, a bit dirtier and a heck of a lot more violent.  Enter Ray Stevenson (Titus Pullo of ""Rome""), a bigger, badder version of Frank Castle.  Not only does Stevenson fully claim the role of the Punisher in ""Punisher:  War Zone,"" he dominates every scene he is in.In ""Punisher:  War Zone,"" we are given a reboot of the Punisher's origin.  Via brief (and well executed) flashbacks, the audience learns that Frank Castle has a huge chip on his shoulder since the murder of his family after they witness a mob hit.  He declares a one man war against all criminals, from the lowest pickpocket to the toughest crime boss.When he accidentally kills an undercover agent while dishing out swift and violent punishment, he decides to turn in his guns.  However, newly crowned crime boss Billy ""The Beaut"" Russoti survives an attack from the Punisher (albeit with a severely disfigured face), and Castle is forced back on the job.Russoti (who now goes by the name ""Jigsaw"") decides to murder the wife and daughter of the undercover agent that Castle accidentally killed.  He goes to the local asylum and picks up his brother, James ""Loony Bin Jim"" Russoti and asks him to help him on his mission.From there, the film is filled with brutal beatings, decapitations, a hint of cannibalism and Frank Castle violently eliminating any and every dirtbag in his way as he tries to stop Jigsaw and LBJ from killing the dead agent's family.  It's not rocket science, but hunting down and killing bad guys is what the Punisher has always done, so I wasn't expecting some emotional tour de force from the film.Overall, this film is the truest to the comics so far.  Stevenson LOOKS like Frank Castle and director Lexi Alexander couldn't have chosen a better person for the role.  Dominic West hams it up a bit as Jigsaw, but his demented villain is a perfect foil to the Punisher.  LBJ, a character created specifically for the film, is portrayed by Doug Hutchison (perhaps best known as Percy from ""The Green Mile"").  Hutchison is even more twisted as LBJ than West is as Jigsaw and, to be quite honest, steals the screen from Castle's primary enemy.  Wayne Knight (Newman of ""Seinfeld"") plays Microchip, Castle's weapons supplier and main source of moral support.  Colin Salmon does a good job as FBI agent Budiansky.  Julie Benz plays the deceased agent's wife and Stephanie Janusauskas plays her daughter.  Rounding out the primary players is Dash Mihok as Soap, head of the ""Punisher Task Force"" and a friend of Castle.Director Alexander makes sure there are plenty of kills in the film, and spared no expense when it came to buckets of blood, explosives and some very well done puppets.  It was nice to see almost no CGI in a film for once.  ""War Zone"" is also filled with plenty of hard hitting music.  The soundtrack only adds to the violent atmosphere of the film.Is ""War Zone"" perfect?  Not at all.  However, it's the best Punisher flick so far and hopefully a sequel will find its way to the big screen in the future.  As stated before, Ray Stevenson owns this role and has set the bar high for any of his future potential replacements.I recommend this film to fans of the ""Punisher"" comics, action flick fans, gore hounds and anyone who likes plenty of 'splosions.  The R-rating is well deserved thanks to a ton of strong language and violent and gory action.

The main area was the special effects of the movie. The movie is very gory like the punisher would be in the comics, but the special effects looked similar to a 90's horror film. A lot of really fake looking blood and fake looking body parts getting blown off. In this day and age with technology the death scenes should have been much better and not so cheesy. The story was just ok to me. There wasn't anything in regards to the story that would make me want to watch this movie over and over again. This version of the punisher is slightly better than the last two versions, but that isn't saying much.

1230488,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B001QB9H1U,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 3]","This is the third movie about Marvel's vigilante hero known as the Punisher.  First, he was played byDolph Lundgrenin 1989 and thenThomas Janein 2004.  ""Punisher: War Zone"" is not so much a sequel to either of those films, but rather a reboot of the series in an attempt to jump start it once again.  The Punisher, a.k.a. Frank Castle (Ray Stevenson), aided and abetted by Micro (Wayne Knight), is trying to take out a gangster named Billy (Dominic West), who ends up in a tub of broken glass.  Billy survives, but his face is sliced to ribbon and he adopts the more appropriate name of Jigsaw.  That is bad enough news for the Punisher, but even worse is his realization that one of Billy's henchmen that he gunned down is an undercover cop, who leaves behind a widow, Angela (Julie Benzwith black hair), and daughter (Stephanie Janusauskas).  Since Frank Castle became the Punisher when his family was gunned down for witnessing a mob execution, this hits home with Frank.  So the Punisher is after Jigsaw, who breaks his equally looney brother Loony Bin Jim (Doug Hutchinson) out of prison.  Jigsaw is after the Punisher, as is Paul Budiansky (Colin Salmon), a by-the-book cop who has no tolerance for vigilantes.  Menawhile, a guilt-ridden Frank reaches out to Angela, who also becomes a target to Jigsaw.  Along the way, the Punisher kills a whole lot of bad guys.When I heard Ray Stevenson was taking over the role of the Punisher I thought it was a good choice, since I loved his work as Titus Pullo in HBO's ""Rome,"" a television series I have liked as much as any I have ever seen.  Plus I remembered Stevenson from ""King Arthur,"" so certainly he has the physical presence that the role requires and makes quite an impact in the opening scenes of the movie, where he is required to say little and communicates much with a look.  Then he starts opening his mouth and the character starts to deteriorate because of the script, which was written by Nick Santora (""The Longshots"") and the team of Art Marcum and Matt Holloway (""Iron Man"").  The more Frank Castle talks, the less it works for the character; what works for Tony Stark, does not for Frank Castle.  Then there is the gangster dialogue that is being spouted by the bad guys, and partly because of that and also because of Jigsaw's sewn up mug, I started to think there was some sort of homage going on to ""Dick Tracy,"" which is what clued me in to what derails this film.Frank Castle's story is tragic and the circumstances with Angela and her daughter brings all of that pain back to the Punisher. Beyond that, the Punisher is not a tradition (read: ""glib"") Marvel superhero (I seem to recall a time when Spider-Man thought the Punisher had told a joke, but could not bring himself to belief it).  The Punisher lets his guns do the talking.  He is a serious dude, arguably one of the most serious characters in the Marvel universe.  But in this 2008 movie he is up against a couple of fairly cartoonish villains.  There is a dictum that says it is not a movie's hero but a movie's villain that elevates it to greatness, and characters from Hannibal Lecter to the most recent version of the Joker evidence the idea.  Jigsaw and his kid brother do not fit the bill as great villains, nor do they belong in the somber world of the Punisher.  Director Lexi Alexander (""Green Street Hooligans"") does a competent job in making this movie and the action sequences deliver blood and violence without constantly taking advantage of CGI, but the characters and dialogue presented by the script hamstring this movie.  This probably dooms any chance of a sequel, but probably puts off the next reboot of the Punisher for eight years or so.",3,The Punisher does not work with cartoon villains and a whole lotta dialogue,1277769600,"06 29, 2010",2010,3694,"['third', 'movie', 'Marvel', 'vigilante', 'hero', 'known', 'Punisher', 'First', 'was', 'played', 'byDolph', 'Lundgrenin', '1989', 'thenThomas', 'Janein', '2004', 'War', 'Zone', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'sequel', 'films', 'rather', 'reboot', 'series', 'attempt', 'jump', 'start', 'once', 'again', 'Punisher', 'a.k.a', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'Ray', 'Stevenson', 'aided', 'abetted', 'Micro', 'Wayne', 'Knight', 'trying', 'take', 'out', 'gangster', 'named', 'Billy', 'Dominic', 'West', 'who', 'up', 'tub', 'broken', 'glass', 'Billy', 'face', 'sliced', 'ribbon', 'more', 'appropriate', 'name', 'Jigsaw', 'bad', 'enough', 'news', 'Punisher', 'even', 'worse', 'realization', 'one', 'Billy', 'henchmen', 'gunned', 'down', 'undercover', 'cop', 'who', 'widow', 'Angela', 'Julie', 'Benzwith', 'black', 'hair', 'daughter', 'Stephanie', 'Janusauskas', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'became', 'Punisher', 'when', 'family', 'was', 'gunned', 'down', 'witnessing', 'mob', 'execution', 'home', 'Frank', 'Punisher', 'Jigsaw', 'who', 'equally', 'looney', 'brother', 'Loony', 'Bin', 'Jim', 'Doug', 'Hutchinson', 'prison', 'Jigsaw', 'Punisher', 'Paul', 'Budiansky', 'Colin', 'Salmon', 'by-the-book', 'cop', 'who', 'tolerance', 'vigilantes', 'Menawhile', 'guilt-ridden', 'Frank', 'out', 'Angela', 'who', 'also', 'target', 'Jigsaw', 'way', 'Punisher', 'whole', 'lot', 'bad', 'guys.When', 'heard', 'Ray', 'Stevenson', 'was', 'taking', 'over', 'role', 'Punisher', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'choice', 'loved', 'work', 'Titus', 'Pullo', 'HBO', 'Rome', 'television', 'series', 'have', 'liked', 'as', 'much', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'remembered', 'Stevenson', 'King', 'Arthur', 'so', 'certainly', 'physical', 'presence', 'role', 'quite', 'impact', 'opening', 'scenes', 'movie', 'where', 'required', 'say', 'little', 'much', 'look', 'Then', 'opening', 'mouth', 'character', 'deteriorate', 'script', 'was', 'written', 'Nick', 'Santora', 'Longshots', 'team', 'Art', 'Marcum', 'Matt', 'Holloway', 'Iron', 'Man', 'more', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'talks', 'less', 'character', 'what', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'not', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'Then', 'gangster', 'dialogue', 'being', 'spouted', 'bad', 'guys', 'partly', 'also', 'Jigsaw', 'sewn', 'up', 'mug', 'started', 'think', 'was', 'sort', 'homage', 'going', 'Dick', 'Tracy', 'what', 'clued', 'what', 'derails', 'film.Frank', 'Castle', 'story', 'tragic', 'circumstances', 'Angela', 'daughter', 'pain', 'back', 'Punisher', 'Beyond', 'Punisher', 'not', 'tradition', 'read', 'glib', 'Marvel', 'superhero', 'seem', 'recall', 'time', 'when', 'Spider-Man', 'thought', 'Punisher', 'had', 'told', 'joke', 'could', 'not', 'bring', 'belief', 'Punisher', 'guns', 'do', 'talking', 'serious', 'dude', 'arguably', 'one', 'most', 'serious', 'characters', 'Marvel', 'universe', '2008', 'movie', 'up', 'couple', 'fairly', 'cartoonish', 'villains', 'dictum', 'not', 'movie', 'hero', 'movie', 'villain', 'greatness', 'characters', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'most', 'recent', 'version', 'Joker', 'evidence', 'idea', 'Jigsaw', 'kid', 'brother', 'do', 'not', 'fit', 'bill', 'great', 'villains', 'do', 'belong', 'somber', 'world', 'Punisher', 'Director', 'Lexi', 'Alexander', 'Green', 'Street', 'Hooligans', 'competent', 'job', 'making', 'movie', 'action', 'deliver', 'blood', 'violence', 'constantly', 'taking', 'advantage', 'CGI', 'characters', 'dialogue', 'presented', 'script', 'hamstring', 'movie', 'probably', 'chance', 'sequel', 'probably', 'next', 'reboot', 'Punisher', 'eight', 'years', 'so']",N/A

1230490,A3178K9AHMHCQV,B001QB9H1U,Luminus,"[6, 11]","Spoilers Ahead!The first thing you need to understand about this movie is that it has no plot.  What you get here is explosions, extreme violence, bad language and rip-offs from Batman the movie and The Dark Knight.  The Punisher does nothing but kill criminals all movie long, stopping only for a moment to reflect upon his accidental murder of an undercover cop, whose family gets kidnapped only because the Punisher kills criminals all movie long.  He has to save them, because, you know, he's their protector now.  Out of guilt, of course.It's true that this Punisher is the most violent; however, that violence is highly cartoonish.  This isn't Goodfellas violent, like it should be, but rather Watchmen alley scene violent.  Shotgun blasts to the head, cause complete disintegration and there's a scene where the Punisher punches someone in the face and the guy's face implodes.  Take in mind that the Punisher is just a powerless human who's snapped and you have to ask exactly who on this planet can do something like that?It's been said that a hero is only as good as his villain and this is where the Punisher commits yet another comic book movie crime.  Jiggsaw is a rip-off of Jack Nickelson's Joker, albeit slightly toned down and a lot less charismatically insane.  It's the absolute worst portrayal of an Italian mob boss I've ever seen in a live-action movie.  It's Krang-level antics from the original TMNT cartoons here.  In fact, Jiggsaw's brother is ten-times better as a character than he is.  Quite impressive, actually.Speaking of rip-offs, some of the music in this movie seems to have been siphoned off from The Dark Knight.  On first introduction of the Punisher, you can clearly hear similar use of string instruments rubbing at a fast pace as it was in The Dark Knight.  It only heightens the hilarity of it, when we see how the Punisher dispatches an entire table of mob members.  It is easily the silliest scene in the movie and only makes the Punisher look ever more like a cartoon character that doesn't know what he's doing.  Not only does he light a flare, after shutting off the power--what exactly was the point of shutting off the lights, if you're going to light a flare?--but he proceeds to kill everyone at the table at a slow enough pace that you would think someone would have pulled a gun and shot him down.  Worst of all, he goes on to hang upside down from a chandelier in a room full of gun-toting criminals in what has got to be the most ridiculous thing I've seen since Ghost Rider.  A true telling of this scene would have had the Punisher using knight-vision goggles as he simply shot-up the entire unlit room.With all that said, it's quite clear that the makers of this movie had little faith in the source material, as once again a character's costume is changed for no good reason.  That box-art is highly deceptive.  Why, exactly, is that cool skull on the Punisher's chest nigh-invisible?  It's there for a reason, yet the filmakers do their best to hide it without actually removing it altogether.  The movie is already shockingly silly.  Why not drive it home with an authentic costume?The acting is quite terrible.  You'd think someone could get cop personalities right after the endless amount of cop dramas filling prime time television these days, but they miss the boat even with this.  This is a bootleg version of the remake to Starsky & Hutch.  In fact, it's Last Action Hero all over again.The Punisher himself is not without fault either.  There's a scene where he's fighting an FBI agent and the agent is giving him competition.  Frank Castle, the Punisher; a war veteran, master of martial arts, stealth tactics, guerilla warfare, an expert in a wide variety of weapons and an ex special ops operative is having trouble with an FBI agent.  You figure that one out.  He's not particularly terrible, but the actor's body language is just wrong in certain places.  This is a hardened, war vet who's lost everything.  He should be a mixture of Sarah Connor, Jason Bourne, and Dirty Harry with a stoic personality, bordering on insanity if not insane altogether.  Dolph Lundren's Punisher was a guy I would genuinely not feel comfortable being in the same room with.  This Punisher is actually embraced by a little girl that only met him ONCE!  Mind you, this is the little girl whose daddy was accidentally killed by the Punisher.As for the ending, it's totally unforgivable.  Jiggsaw virtually committed suicide.  I can't see any leader of so many being that stupid.  Any villain that allows the Punisher to continue holding a gun under any condition is a fool.  Period.Get ready to turn your brain to the negative setting and take some comfort in knowing it's at least violent and gritty as frak.",1,Easily the worst of the Punisher films,1249776000,"08 9, 2009",2009,4763,"['Spoilers', 'Ahead', 'first', 'thing', 'need', 'understand', 'movie', 'plot', 'What', 'get', 'here', 'explosions', 'extreme', 'violence', 'bad', 'language', 'rip-offs', 'Batman', 'movie', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Punisher', 'nothing', 'kill', 'criminals', 'movie', 'long', 'stopping', 'only', 'moment', 'reflect', 'accidental', 'murder', 'undercover', 'cop', 'family', 'kidnapped', 'only', 'Punisher', 'kills', 'criminals', 'movie', 'long', 'save', 'know', 'protector', 'now', 'guilt', 'course.It', 'true', 'Punisher', 'most', 'violent', 'however', 'violence', 'highly', 'cartoonish', ""n't"", 'Goodfellas', 'violent', 'should', 'be', 'rather', 'Watchmen', 'alley', 'scene', 'violent', 'Shotgun', 'blasts', 'head', 'cause', 'complete', 'disintegration', 'scene', 'where', 'Punisher', 'punches', 'someone', 'face', 'guy', 'face', 'Take', 'mind', 'Punisher', 'just', 'powerless', 'human', 'who', 'snapped', 'have', 'ask', 'exactly', 'who', 'planet', 'can', 'do', 'something', 'been', 'said', 'hero', 'only', 'as', 'good', 'villain', 'where', 'Punisher', 'yet', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'crime', 'Jiggsaw', 'rip-off', 'Jack', 'Nickelson', 'Joker', 'slightly', 'toned', 'down', 'lot', 'less', 'charismatically', 'insane', 'absolute', 'worst', 'portrayal', 'Italian', 'mob', 'boss', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'live-action', 'movie', 'Krang-level', 'antics', 'original', 'TMNT', 'cartoons', 'here', 'fact', 'Jiggsaw', 'brother', 'ten-times', 'better', 'character', 'Quite', 'impressive', 'actually.Speaking', 'rip-offs', 'music', 'movie', 'have', 'been', 'siphoned', 'off', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'first', 'introduction', 'Punisher', 'can', 'clearly', 'hear', 'similar', 'use', 'string', 'instruments', 'rubbing', 'fast', 'pace', 'was', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'only', 'hilarity', 'when', 'see', 'how', 'Punisher', 'entire', 'table', 'mob', 'members', 'easily', 'silliest', 'scene', 'movie', 'only', 'Punisher', 'look', 'ever', 'more', 'cartoon', 'character', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'doing', 'Not', 'only', 'light', 'flare', 'shutting', 'off', 'power', 'what', 'exactly', 'was', 'point', 'shutting', 'off', 'lights', ""'re"", 'going', 'light', 'flare', 'kill', 'everyone', 'table', 'slow', 'enough', 'pace', 'would', 'think', 'someone', 'would', 'have', 'pulled', 'gun', 'shot', 'down', 'Worst', 'hang', 'upside', 'down', 'chandelier', 'room', 'full', 'gun-toting', 'criminals', 'got', 'be', 'most', 'ridiculous', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'A', 'true', 'telling', 'scene', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'Punisher', 'using', 'knight-vision', 'goggles', 'simply', 'shot-up', 'entire', 'unlit', 'room.With', 'said', 'quite', 'clear', 'makers', 'movie', 'had', 'little', 'faith', 'source', 'material', 'once', 'again', 'character', 'costume', 'changed', 'good', 'reason', 'box-art', 'highly', 'deceptive', 'Why', 'exactly', 'cool', 'skull', 'Punisher', 'chest', 'nigh-invisible', 'there', 'reason', 'filmakers', 'do', 'best', 'hide', 'actually', 'removing', 'altogether', 'movie', 'already', 'shockingly', 'silly', 'Why', 'not', 'drive', 'home', 'authentic', 'costume', 'acting', 'quite', 'terrible', ""'d"", 'think', 'someone', 'could', 'get', 'cop', 'personalities', 'right', 'endless', 'amount', 'cop', 'dramas', 'filling', 'prime', 'time', 'television', 'days', 'miss', 'boat', 'even', 'bootleg', 'version', 'remake', 'Starsky', 'Hutch', 'fact', 'Last', 'Action', 'Hero', 'again.The', 'Punisher', 'not', 'fault', 'either', 'scene', 'where', 'fighting', 'FBI', 'agent', 'agent', 'giving', 'competition', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'Punisher', 'war', 'veteran', 'master', 'martial', 'arts', 'stealth', 'tactics', 'guerilla', 'warfare', 'expert', 'wide', 'variety', 'weapons', 'ex', 'special', 'ops', 'operative', 'having', 'trouble', 'FBI', 'agent', 'figure', 'one', 'out', 'not', 'particularly', 'terrible', 'actor', 'body', 'language', 'just', 'wrong', 'certain', 'places', 'hardened', 'war', 'vet', 'who', 'lost', 'everything', 'should', 'be', 'mixture', 'Sarah', 'Connor', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'stoic', 'personality', 'bordering', 'insanity', 'not', 'insane', 'altogether', 'Dolph', 'Lundren', 'Punisher', 'was', 'guy', 'would', 'genuinely', 'not', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'being', 'same', 'room', 'Punisher', 'actually', 'embraced', 'little', 'girl', 'only', 'met', 'ONCE', 'Mind', 'little', 'girl', 'daddy', 'was', 'accidentally', 'killed', 'Punisher.As', 'ending', 'totally', 'unforgivable', 'Jiggsaw', 'virtually', 'committed', 'suicide', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'leader', 'so', 'many', 'being', 'stupid', 'villain', 'Punisher', 'continue', 'holding', 'gun', 'condition', 'fool', 'Period.Get', 'ready', 'turn', 'brain', 'negative', 'setting', 'take', 'comfort', 'knowing', 'least', 'violent', 'gritty', 'frak']",N/A

This movie tells a story and doesn't feel like it was put together by insane chimps.Start with a lead actor who not only looks like he's too old, he moves like it, too. Seeing an action hero's hips wobble as he tries to run and look athletic is hilarious, frankly. But, sadly, that doesn't save this ridiculous film. And, I know, The Punisher: War Zone doesn't pretend to be anything more than a ""B"" movie. The problem, however, that it's really pretty terrible even by ""B"" movie standards. The villains are ridiculous, including a tiny psychopath with man-boobs who eats people's kidneys. That character might have worked if the guy had a presence just slightly more macho than Pee Wee Herman. (And, if memory serves, it's the same actor who did a nice job in The Green Mile -- playing a character much closer to his physical and emotional skill set.)Yes, there are some entertaining moments in The Punisher: War Zone. The film does have a bit of a sense of humor, and the over-top-violence has some cartoon-like merit. Some ... like the ax-wielding ""poor man's"" Joe Pesci who keeps ""axing"" questions.

1230493,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,B001QB9H1U,Michael Crane,"[1, 1]","People who were disappointed by the last ""Punisher"" flick for lack of violence or non-stop brutality should be satisfied with ""Punisher: War Zone,"" as there is no shortage of gore and brutal killings by the one and only Frank Castle.  While I admit that I was a big fan of the last movie, I have to say I love that this new film has fun with itself and stays a little more true to the actual ""Punisher"" origins.(NOTE:  You do not have to have seen the other two movies.  Like ""Batman Begins,"" it does not acknowledge them in any way.)The Punisher declares hunting season on the mob after his family is murdered.  He has dedicated his life to getting rid of criminals in the most brutal and unforgiving ways.  One of those unfortunate mobsters who almost becomes another notch on Punisher's belt is Billy Russoti, but he survives with a horribly disfigured face.  Giving himself the new alias, ""Jigsaw,"" Billy swears that he'll get his revenge and that The Punisher will be no more.  Meanwhile, Castle is having doubts about his crusade against the guilty when an undercover agent gets caught in the crossfire.  He may accept the fact that he is forever damned and there is no way he can ever be saved for his crimes, but when innocent people can become casualties, he wonders if his personal war is even worth it.Again, I was a big fan of the last movie, but that one was trying to be more of an actual film than a comic book movie.  Because of that, some action and violence was sacrificed.  This is not the case in ""Punisher: War Zone.""  The film is gleefully over-the-top and is covered with action and gruesome deaths.  The look and feel is more of a comic book than a serious film, and this works.  The movie also doesn't take itself too seriously.  You can almost sense moments where you know the movie is winking at you as it is being purposely corny at times.  The reason this works is because the movie is having fun with itself, where other action movies can take themselves way too seriously and end up being parodies of themselves.  In a way, the look and feel reminds me a lot of ""Running Scared"" (the one with Paul Walker, not the action/comedy with Billy Crystal).While the movie can be goofy and over-the-top, none of the characters are flat.  Ray Stevenson does a great job of playing ""Frank Castle.""  He has the correct body type, and he knows when to play him as being emotionless, and then when he is in complete and utter anguish and doubt.  Dominic West is delightfully funny and evil as the disfigured mobster, ""Jigsaw.""  You can tell he had a lot of fun with the role, as he doesn't take himself too seriously.  The Blu Ray version of this movie looks FANTASTIC.  There are some cool featurettes that are worth checking out, as well.I cannot stress this enough, this movie is EXTREMELY GRAPHIC with its violence.  Now, if you've been a fan of the comic, then you pretty much know what you're in for.  People who do not and aren't used to this amount of violence will definitely be put off.  If you can't stomach the sight of a man getting his kidney ripped out only to have it eaten by a lunatic afterwards, this movie is probably not for you.  Lots of exploding heads, decapitations, loss of limbs and even an impalement or two are just a few examples that come to mind.""Punisher: War Zone"" is one hell of an entertaining time if you take it for what it is.  I still love the last flick that came out a few years ago, but I'm happy to see that this one takes full advantage of trying to give you an accurate presentation of what ""The Punisher"" really should be if you go by the comics. - Michael Crane",4,"""Sometimes I'd like to get my hands on God...""",1237939200,"03 25, 2009",2009,3626,"['People', 'who', 'were', 'disappointed', 'last', 'Punisher', 'flick', 'lack', 'violence', 'non-stop', 'brutality', 'should', 'be', 'satisfied', 'Punisher', 'War', 'Zone', 'shortage', 'gore', 'brutal', 'killings', 'one', 'only', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'admit', 'was', 'big', 'fan', 'last', 'movie', 'have', 'say', 'love', 'new', 'film', 'fun', 'stays', 'little', 'more', 'true', 'actual', 'Punisher', 'origins', 'NOTE', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'have', 'seen', 'other', 'two', 'movies', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'not', 'acknowledge', 'way', 'Punisher', 'hunting', 'season', 'mob', 'family', 'murdered', 'dedicated', 'life', 'getting', 'rid', 'criminals', 'most', 'brutal', 'unforgiving', 'ways', 'One', 'unfortunate', 'mobsters', 'who', 'almost', 'notch', 'Punisher', 'belt', 'Billy', 'Russoti', 'horribly', 'disfigured', 'face', 'Giving', 'new', 'alias', 'Jigsaw', 'Billy', ""'ll"", 'get', 'revenge', 'Punisher', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'Meanwhile', 'Castle', 'having', 'doubts', 'crusade', 'guilty', 'when', 'undercover', 'agent', 'caught', 'crossfire', 'may', 'accept', 'fact', 'forever', 'damned', 'way', 'can', 'ever', 'be', 'saved', 'crimes', 'when', 'innocent', 'people', 'can', 'become', 'casualties', 'personal', 'war', 'even', 'worth', 'it.Again', 'was', 'big', 'fan', 'last', 'movie', 'one', 'was', 'trying', 'be', 'more', 'actual', 'film', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'action', 'violence', 'was', 'sacrificed', 'not', 'case', 'Punisher', 'War', 'Zone', 'film', 'gleefully', 'over-the-top', 'covered', 'action', 'gruesome', 'deaths', 'look', 'feel', 'more', 'comic', 'book', 'serious', 'film', 'movie', 'also', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'can', 'almost', 'sense', 'moments', 'where', 'know', 'movie', 'winking', 'being', 'purposely', 'corny', 'times', 'reason', 'works', 'movie', 'having', 'fun', 'where', 'other', 'action', 'movies', 'can', 'take', 'way', 'too', 'seriously', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'parodies', 'way', 'look', 'feel', 'reminds', 'lot', 'Running', 'Scared', 'one', 'Paul', 'Walker', 'not', 'action/comedy', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'goofy', 'over-the-top', 'none', 'characters', 'are', 'flat', 'Ray', 'Stevenson', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'correct', 'body', 'type', 'when', 'play', 'being', 'emotionless', 'then', 'when', 'complete', 'utter', 'anguish', 'doubt', 'Dominic', 'West', 'delightfully', 'funny', 'evil', 'disfigured', 'mobster', 'Jigsaw', 'can', 'tell', 'had', 'lot', 'fun', 'role', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'version', 'movie', 'FANTASTIC', 'are', 'cool', 'featurettes', 'are', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'well.I', 'can', 'not', 'stress', 'enough', 'movie', 'EXTREMELY', 'GRAPHIC', 'violence', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'comic', 'then', 'pretty', 'much', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'People', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'are', ""n't"", 'used', 'amount', 'violence', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'put', 'off', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stomach', 'sight', 'man', 'getting', 'kidney', 'ripped', 'out', 'only', 'have', 'eaten', 'lunatic', 'afterwards', 'movie', 'probably', 'not', 'Lots', 'exploding', 'heads', 'decapitations', 'loss', 'limbs', 'even', 'impalement', 'two', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'examples', 'come', 'mind', 'War', 'Zone', 'one', 'hell', 'entertaining', 'time', 'take', 'what', 'still', 'love', 'last', 'flick', 'came', 'out', 'few', 'years', 'ago', ""'m"", 'happy', 'see', 'one', 'full', 'advantage', 'trying', 'give', 'accurate', 'presentation', 'what', 'Punisher', 'really', 'should', 'be', 'go', 'comics', 'Michael', 'Crane']",N/A

Durham ""Big Evil""","[0, 0]","I'd give Punisher: War Zone 3.5 stars if I could, as it is definitely better than the 2004 treatment starring Thomas Jane and John Travolta, and stands as the most faithful screen treatment that good 'ol Frank has gotten yet.  Ray Stevenson (HBO's Rome) stars as Frank Castle this time around, who after accidentally killing an undercover FBI agent during one of his latest bullet-ridden sprees, seeks to give up being the Punisher.  However, hideously scarred mobster Jigsaw (The Wire's Dominic West) has different plans for Frank, including taking out the late fed's wife (Dexter's Julie Benz) and daughter (Stephanie Janusauskas).  Directed by Lexi Alexander (Green Street Hooligans), Punisher: War Zone is ridiculously violent almost to the point of turning into a live-action cartoon, and still manages to retain most of the tone of Garth Ennis' excellent run on the comic.  Stevenson is definitely the most physically imposing actor to play the Punisher, and is the best one above all as well.  The rest of the acting however is almost comical, with West and Doug Hutchison, who plays Jigsaw's cannibal brother Loony Bin Jim, going so far over the top that you can't help but laugh.  The film's dialogue and script don't help matters any, but the bloody action sequences are done well and are worth seeing the film for alone.  Despite its flaws though, Punisher: War Zone still manages to be pretty entertaining, and is definitely the most satisfying adaptation that the character has received yet.

The more they adhere to the well written Garth Ennis comic book series, the better; and the movie suffers whenever they stray.This film is far from perfect though; villians like McGinty, the Rastafarian Irishman from the ""Kitchen Irish"" comics storyline, are altered from his comic roots and diminished or mishandled; and although it is nice to see classic 1980's villain Jigsaw finally appear on film, he is a little behind the times since the comic series has moved on to more traditional Goombah villains.Punisher sidekick Microchip is also wasted in the film and used to little effect (Spoiler***********His death in the film means little since we hardly get to know who he is and what he is about, where as his death in the comics at the hands of the Punisher had a lot more meaning because of Microchip's betraying the Punisher after years of partnership*******Spoiler ends).The directing, although decent, and far better than the previous efforts, lacks a little on the technical side, but the film looks good and is well acted for the most part; although there were some heavy handed scenes of violence and humor which could have been done better.Overall, the movie is guilty of trying to do too much. Microchip's character could have been built up over a few movies and Jigsaw is is given another Punisher villain's origin story. The film works more as a sequel to another film which has yet to be made rather than as a fresh start to the series.On a sad note, even though this movie is the best of the three efforts to bring the Punisher to the big screen, the movie's pitiful box office gaurantees we will not see another Punisher film for quite a while.",3,"Worthy Punisher movie, better than the last two!",1246060800,"06 27, 2009",2009,1986,"['Finally', 'decent', 'Punisher', 'movie', 'ultra', 'low', 'budget', '1990', 'movie', 'starring', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'boring', 'eqaully', 'cheap', '2004', 'movie', 'starring', 'excellent', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'finally', 'get', 'right.The', 'main', 'reason', 'movie', 'stick', 'comic', 'book', 'source', 'material', 'more', 'previous', 'versions', 'more', 'adhere', 'well', 'written', 'Garth', 'Ennis', 'comic', 'book', 'series', 'better', 'movie', 'suffers', 'whenever', 'stray.This', 'film', 'far', 'perfect', 'villians', 'McGinty', 'Rastafarian', 'Irishman', 'Kitchen', 'Irish', 'comics', 'storyline', 'are', 'altered', 'comic', 'roots', 'diminished', 'mishandled', 'nice', 'see', 'classic', '1980', 'villain', 'Jigsaw', 'finally', 'appear', 'film', 'little', 'times', 'comic', 'series', 'moved', 'more', 'traditional', 'Goombah', 'villains.Punisher', 'sidekick', 'Microchip', 'also', 'wasted', 'film', 'used', 'little', 'effect', 'Spoiler***********His', 'death', 'film', 'little', 'hardly', 'get', 'know', 'who', 'what', 'about', 'where', 'death', 'comics', 'hands', 'Punisher', 'had', 'lot', 'more', 'meaning', 'Microchip', 'betraying', 'Punisher', 'years', 'partnership*******Spoiler', 'ends', '.The', 'directing', 'decent', 'far', 'better', 'previous', 'efforts', 'little', 'technical', 'side', 'film', 'good', 'well', 'acted', 'most', 'part', 'were', 'heavy', 'handed', 'scenes', 'violence', 'humor', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'better.Overall', 'movie', 'guilty', 'trying', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'Microchip', 'character', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'built', 'up', 'few', 'movies', 'Jigsaw', 'given', 'Punisher', 'villain', 'origin', 'story', 'film', 'more', 'sequel', 'film', 'yet', 'be', 'made', 'rather', 'fresh', 'start', 'series.On', 'sad', 'note', 'even', 'movie', 'best', 'three', 'efforts', 'bring', 'Punisher', 'big', 'screen', 'movie', 'pitiful', 'box', 'office', 'will', 'not', 'see', 'Punisher', 'film', 'quite', 'while']",N/A

It's at least as bad as Batman and Robin, Catwoman, and Elektra if not worse.The biggest let down of this movie is the Punisher himself. What the first movie did right was it created a character we could care about. We had sympathy for the guy as we had just seen his entire family murdered. That Punisher had a purpose. This Punisher's character is as thin as the comic pages he's printed on. He doesn't even talk for the first 30min of the movie. And then we're supposed to care when Don from 3rd Rock from the Sun is kidnapped. Why is Don in this movie?And then there's Scarface...I mean Jigsaw. Compare him with Heath Ledger's Joker and this guy is about as menacing as the robbers in Home Alone. It was PAINFUL watching the guy look in the mirror and then start crying. The guy may have killed people in brutal ways but he was one of the most corny villains in any comic book movie to date.Fans of the comic say this one is more true to the source material than the first movie was. If that's the case, then I guess I wouldn't like the comic if I read it because this movie was pure junk. It was so bad it was boring. When the woman is pointing the gun at the Punisher and he told her to squeeze...I was really hoping she would. But then her stupid son had to break in and say ""Mom, where's my red pen? I need it!""

None of you have any idea what you are talking about because you obviously have no idea who the Punisher is. You may think you do, but you do not. With that being said...I took my girlfriend to it against her will (she did not want to see it because she loved Thomas Jane). Let me tell you, she was not only awake for the whole thing, but absolutely loved it. Thomas Jane who...? Ray Stevenson, yes. No kidding. She was quite literally blown away, and she doesn't even read comics. I do! As both an avid movie-goer and comic fan this movie made me happy.Characters & ActorsRay Stevenson is Frank Castle bar none. NO ONE could do a better job as the Punisher. The grit, remorselessness, seriousness and brutal nature of Punisher is portrayed by Stevenson perfectly. Thomas Jane was great, but no where near as believable. Dolph Lundgren was a joke as the Punisher.Dominic West was perfect as the mangled criminal, Jigsaw. He speaks terror like no other. A true arch-nemesis to the Punisher.Let's not forget Wayne Knight (ex-Newmen)'s wonderful part as Linus""Microchip"" Lieberman, Frank's partner. Knight deserves major credit for his role. He really stands out with his performance because he makes the character worth watching and remembering.The movie's toneExtremely over the top blood shed. No holds barred entertainment all the way through. Bullet riddled bodies, dismemberments, profanity, this IS the Punisher at its finest. Truly, rivils Garth Ennis' comic book version of the Punisher. DO NOT watch this with the kiddies. You have been warned.To put it blunt, do not believe the haters of this movie. They obviously missed the satire of this film. Apparently, they cannot get pass the violence. Yes, it is violent, yes it is brutal, but that IS after all the world of the Punisher. This movie really, truly is how the Punisher should be. Very brutal with a nice touch of dark humor to balance it out. It isn't suppose to be realistic, it is suppose to make fun of itself. Duh! Any comic book fan could tell you that.If you are not a comic fan and take everything literally and seriously, you will probably hate this film. But, if you are like me and can see pass the profanity and violence, and understand what this movie is trying to achieve, you should enjoy it. The movie does not deserve an Oscar or put in the book as the best movie of all time, but does do exactly what it set out to do, shock and entertain those who value humor and action. Quentin Tarantino fans would probably fall in love with this movie. Fans of Titanic will hate it.",5,Ray Stevenson IS Frank Castle...

Ray Stevenson was also a surprise choice for the role but he did it amazingly well and to the true role of the Punisher.  The movies gives a nice story-plot of showing Franks choice and after a grievous mistake begins to question what he's doing and his chosen role as Punisher against the criminal underworld.  The violence is gory and intense not I'm sure most know to be show to young children but for us adults a great show of action.  The main story of Jigsaw is the main story-line of course but you also see that the Punisher realizes that he needn't turn away from all his emotions and feelings that make him human as well.

1230520,A3BJDFGSLXFB36,B001QB9H1U,R. Legendre,"[0, 0]","I was a huge fan of the Punisher ever since his 5-issue limited series was released by Marvel comics in 1986. I was a regular reader of the ongoing series up until the time I got married and pretty much gave up comic book reading. Out of all the comics I read/collected, the Punisher was my favorite. There was just something about the character that was so appealing. He wasn't just a bad-a**, he was a tortured soul. Pretty deep stuff for a comic book.Well, I had the (mis)fortune of seeing an advance ""rough cut"" of the first Punisher film with Dolph Lundgren before it was released (I had my sources). I was VERY disappointed. Bad acting, bad story, bad dialogue, bad production values; just plain bad all around.The 2004 version was an improvement, but still didn't live up to the Punisher character that I had loved for nearly 20 years. I felt that Thomas Jane's interpretation of Frank Castle was OK, but the overall product was sort of lackluster in it's approach and some sequences were downright silly (""Bring in the Russian!"" Puh-lease!).Well, I found ""War Zone"" to be the most accurate verison of the character on film to date. Ray Stevenson LOOKS the most like the iconic vigilante. Dolph was close and Thomas never came close enough. This film is also true to the original mythology of the character (how he became the Punisher, his relationship with Microchip, etc.) and Stevens does an excellent acting job of portraying the ""tortured soul"" of Frank Castle.My biggest problem with the film was the mafia characters. Every single one of them was a cliche with the stereotypical greasy, slicked-back hair and outrageous, over-the-top Italian accents. The main villain, ""Jigsaw"" (who steals a line right out of 1989's ""Batman""), becomes a cartoon-like version of the character after his ""transformation"". He begins to strut around like George Jefferson and spout out ham-fisted dialogue as if he were performing in some type of comedy act.Another bone of contention I had was with the GORE. I realize that the Punisher is all about guns and guts, brawn and bullets; but almost every time he shoots someone, it's a head-shot and we have to see their heads explode. There's even a scene where Castle punches a bad-guy in the face and his face explodes. ***** POSSIBLE SPOILER ***** But, when an ally of his has been hacked wide open with an axe and begs Castle not to let him die this way, Castle performs a mercy killing by shooting him.....but of course, the camera cuts to black and we hear the gunshot. We can't show that to the audience. It's too violent.What?????Despite these major flaws, I found the film compelling enough to watch all the way through. I was actually interested in the story and cared about what happened to the characters. The plot does become kind of flimsy from time to time and you're not quite sure which direction the story wants to go; sort of like a high-wire acrobat trying to keep his balance on the rope. But towards the final third of the film, the pace picks up and you get caught up in the story and action.I can recommend this to action film fans, although some may be put off by the over-the-top graphic nature of the violence. Punisher fans will most likely LOVE the film.I actually liked it, but I'm content enough to have rented instead of purchased.",3,Most accurate version so far,1239840000,"04 16, 2009",2009,3305,"['was', 'huge', 'fan', 'Punisher', 'ever', '5-issue', 'limited', 'series', 'was', 'released', 'Marvel', 'comics', '1986', 'was', 'regular', 'reader', 'ongoing', 'series', 'up', 'time', 'got', 'married', 'pretty', 'much', 'gave', 'up', 'comic', 'book', 'reading', 'comics', 'read/collected', 'Punisher', 'was', 'favorite', 'was', 'just', 'something', 'character', 'was', 'so', 'appealing', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'bad-a**', 'was', 'tortured', 'soul', 'Pretty', 'deep', 'stuff', 'comic', 'book.Well', 'had', 'mis', 'fortune', 'seeing', 'advance', 'rough', 'cut', 'first', 'Punisher', 'film', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'was', 'released', 'had', 'sources', 'was', 'VERY', 'disappointed', 'Bad', 'acting', 'bad', 'story', 'bad', 'dialogue', 'bad', 'production', 'values', 'just', 'plain', 'bad', 'around.The', '2004', 'version', 'was', 'improvement', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'Punisher', 'character', 'had', 'loved', 'nearly', '20', 'years', 'felt', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'interpretation', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'was', 'OK', 'overall', 'product', 'was', 'sort', 'lackluster', 'approach', 'sequences', 'were', 'downright', 'silly', 'Bring', 'Russian', 'Puh-lease', '.Well', 'found', 'War', 'Zone', 'be', 'most', 'accurate', 'verison', 'character', 'film', 'date', 'Ray', 'Stevenson', 'LOOKS', 'most', 'iconic', 'vigilante', 'Dolph', 'was', 'close', 'Thomas', 'never', 'came', 'close', 'enough', 'film', 'also', 'true', 'original', 'mythology', 'character', 'how', 'became', 'Punisher', 'relationship', 'Microchip', 'etc', 'Stevens', 'excellent', 'acting', 'job', 'portraying', 'tortured', 'soul', 'Frank', 'Castle.My', 'biggest', 'problem', 'film', 'was', 'mafia', 'characters', 'single', 'one', 'was', 'cliche', 'stereotypical', 'greasy', 'slicked-back', 'hair', 'outrageous', 'over-the-top', 'Italian', 'accents', 'main', 'villain', 'Jigsaw', 'who', 'line', 'right', '1989', 'Batman', 'cartoon-like', 'version', 'character', 'transformation', 'strut', 'George', 'Jefferson', 'spout', 'out', 'ham-fisted', 'dialogue', 'were', 'performing', 'type', 'comedy', 'bone', 'contention', 'had', 'was', 'GORE', 'realize', 'Punisher', 'guns', 'guts', 'brawn', 'bullets', 'almost', 'time', 'someone', 'head-shot', 'have', 'see', 'heads', 'explode', 'even', 'scene', 'where', 'Castle', 'bad-guy', 'face', 'face', 'explodes', 'POSSIBLE', 'SPOILER', '*****', 'when', 'ally', 'been', 'hacked', 'wide', 'open', 'axe', 'begs', 'Castle', 'not', 'let', 'die', 'way', 'Castle', 'mercy', 'killing', 'shooting', '..but', 'course', 'camera', 'black', 'hear', 'gunshot', 'ca', ""n't"", 'show', 'audience', 'too', 'violent.What', 'major', 'flaws', 'found', 'film', 'compelling', 'enough', 'watch', 'way', 'was', 'actually', 'interested', 'story', 'cared', 'what', 'happened', 'characters', 'plot', 'become', 'kind', 'flimsy', 'time', 'time', ""'re"", 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'direction', 'story', 'go', 'sort', 'high-wire', 'acrobat', 'trying', 'keep', 'balance', 'rope', 'final', 'third', 'film', 'pace', 'up', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'story', 'action.I', 'can', 'recommend', 'action', 'film', 'fans', 'may', 'be', 'put', 'off', 'over-the-top', 'graphic', 'nature', 'violence', 'fans', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'LOVE', 'film.I', 'actually', 'liked', ""'m"", 'content', 'enough', 'have', 'rented', 'instead', 'purchased']",N/A

Third time around re-booting the franchise, Ray Stevenson plays the character role of Frank Castle, AKA the Punisher. The presentation of Castle in this movie is very true to the comics; he wears the armor, has the arsenal of weapons, and even includes Micro, a character that was ignored in all previous adaptations.So what is wrong with the flick?...Quite simply that aside from the astonishing bloodshed and over the top gore...the movie just feels like an exaggerated comic book film. I mean yes it is based on a comic book, but at least give it some character development. The characters are all there for you to see for a mere min and are later killed gruesomely. The lines are way too corny at times, so is the setting at times.

1230535,A2CT2SA6KFE8GC,B001QB9H1U,"Stanley Runk ""Runkdapunk""","[0, 0]","I'll admit I'm not much for the huge Marvel movie craze(or DC for that matter), but I do have a soft spot for the underdogs.  I'm probably one of six people in the world who would prefer to watch Man Thing over Spiderman.  While The Punisher is a very recognizable character, he doesn't really seem to be all that popular of a character when compared to his Marvel peers.  The box office receipts certainly reflect this.Though I never really read much of the comic, I'm more interested in this particular Marvel character being that he's not really a superhero, and is about as far removed from the Marvel universe as any of it's other heroes.  Add to that the fact that I love vigilante films.  I had also heard that this movie was more in the style of a trashy 80s action film(right away I'm thinking of films from the Cannon Group).  Then I see that The Punisher is played by none other than good ol' Titus Pullo from HBO's Rome, and the deal was sealed.Yup, the movie was pretty much exactly as I was expecting, and that's a good thing.  Here The Punisher is up against a villain the he himself had a hand in creating-Jigsaw of course.  Plot details are really of no importance when talking about a movie like this because it's 100% cliche.The movie was panned by critics for being nothing more than a glorified and extended, plotless bloodbath.  Punisher comic fans have said it's true to the spirit of the comic, but some were unhappy with the fact that the character of Frank Castle wasn't fleshed out more-Almost like the ""sequel"" had taken a step back rather than forward.  Then there are others who just thought it was hokey.Personally, I felt the Thomas Jayne Punisher(which I also enjoyed) did what it could to dig into Castle's mind.  In it's own odd way, War Zone's lack of characterization can be seen as a kind of progression of sorts, as Castle is now so far gone that he's just cold, empty, pissed off and wants to blow everyone into little pieces.But lets not kid ourselves here-This film is just violent, silly, cliched nonsense, and it is not trying to be anything more.  Junk food entertainment on a highly entertaining scale(if you enjoy junk food, that is).  It seems almost pointless to criticize the film for it's cliched plot and dialogue, cornball hammy acting and pornographic violence because the movie is making no attempt to be anything more than what its is, and what were you really expecting from Punisher: War Zone anyway?I loved Ray Stevenson.  I'm a little biased being a huge fan of Rome, and I had no problems with Thomas Jayne(or even Dolph Lundgren for that matter!), but I thought Stevenson really looked the part.  Acting wise it was a pretty by the numbers tough guy action role, so I can't say his performance was terrific, but he was cool to watch.  Jigsaw is a cartoony villain straight out of Dick Tracy, only more sinister and he swears more.  Dominic West just hams him up so much that I can't help but like him.  His brother, Loony Bin Jim is supposed to be this horrifyingly crazy Hannibal Lecter type, but to me he just comes off as a weasel.Is the film violent?  Sure is, as much as an R rating will allow.  Lots of CGI blood and headshots.  Castle punches a dude so hard his hand goes through his face!  I'd say that it reminded me of the style of violence in the last Rambo film.  I'll take good ol' squibs any day over CGI, but oh well.What else can I say?

The latest incarnation of the heavily-armed vigilante goes so overboard with unbelievable violence and vulgarities that the incredibly bad dialogue almost comes as a relief at times. Almost all of the elaborate set-ups and character introductions serve only as a fulcrum to unleash more brutal slaughter, and the slightest hints of realism are overshadowed by ludicrous villains and even more laughable abuse of bloodletting. At least no one can say more punishing transpired in previous efforts at bringing the Marvel gunslinger to life.After losing his wife and two kids at the hands of the mob, Frank Castle (Ray Stevenson) becomes The Punisher and mercilessly metes out vigilante justice to the criminal underworld. Killing his way to the top of all the major crime families, Castle accidentally shoots an undercover FBI Agent during an attempt to eradicate Billy Russoti (Dominic West). Vowing to leave his life of violence, Frank must first finish what he started and kill Russoti before the mutilated madman, now donning the moniker ""Jigsaw,"" can murder the wife and child of the slain agent.Vile and literally ugly (from the filthy streets, sewers and alleys to the hideously scarred villains) Punisher: War Zone is not a lively movie, though perhaps its tone more appropriately recalls the source material. Unquestionable punishing constantly takes place, but it's questionable whether the characters on screen are receiving as much as the audience. Despicably bloody violence begets even more wretched bloodshed, and seems to be inserted in every scene just for the sake of extremes. When it's done right, violence can be entertaining, humorous, or just plain cool. But in War Zone it serves no purpose other than to disgust and to gloat at how excessive it can be. With little wit and almost completely devoid of slow-motion, the action sequences are never flourished with the shocking brutality - they exist to make use of the ""R"" rating to the fullest extent.If the quality of villains was measured positively by their terribly trite dialogue, Punisher: War Zone would have the greatest cinematic bad guys of all time. Not a single utterance is original or clever, and a major percent of it is flat out unnecessary. This year's Hell Ride is possibly the only other movie in history that failed this badly at crafting dialogue to tie together action sequences and a practically nonexistent story. The atrocious script plagues the heroes as well, frequently creating ridiculous ""emotional"" scenes between Frank and the daughter of the FBI agent he accidentally killed. If there's anything positive to be said about this new cinematic take on The Punisher, it's that Marvel and Lionsgate didn't shy away from the harsh violence that made the most recent versions of the comic books strictly adults only.- The Massie Twins",1,Punisher: War Zone Movie Review from The Massie Twins,1228348800,"12 4, 2008",2008,2894,"['Saw', 'were', 'action', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'Punisher', 'War', 'Zone', 'latest', 'incarnation', 'heavily-armed', 'vigilante', 'so', 'overboard', 'unbelievable', 'violence', 'vulgarities', 'incredibly', 'bad', 'dialogue', 'almost', 'relief', 'times', 'Almost', 'elaborate', 'set-ups', 'character', 'introductions', 'serve', 'only', 'fulcrum', 'unleash', 'more', 'brutal', 'slaughter', 'slightest', 'hints', 'realism', 'are', 'overshadowed', 'ludicrous', 'villains', 'even', 'more', 'laughable', 'abuse', 'bloodletting', 'least', 'one', 'can', 'say', 'more', 'punishing', 'transpired', 'previous', 'efforts', 'bringing', 'Marvel', 'gunslinger', 'life.After', 'losing', 'wife', 'two', 'kids', 'hands', 'mob', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'Ray', 'Stevenson', 'Punisher', 'mercilessly', 'out', 'vigilante', 'justice', 'criminal', 'underworld', 'Killing', 'way', 'top', 'major', 'crime', 'families', 'Castle', 'accidentally', 'shoots', 'undercover', 'FBI', 'Agent', 'attempt', 'eradicate', 'Billy', 'Russoti', 'Dominic', 'West', 'Vowing', 'leave', 'life', 'violence', 'Frank', 'must', 'first', 'finish', 'what', 'started', 'kill', 'Russoti', 'mutilated', 'madman', 'now', 'donning', 'moniker', 'Jigsaw', 'can', 'murder', 'wife', 'child', 'slain', 'agent.Vile', 'literally', 'ugly', 'filthy', 'streets', 'sewers', 'alleys', 'hideously', 'scarred', 'villains', 'Punisher', 'War', 'Zone', 'not', 'lively', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'tone', 'more', 'appropriately', 'source', 'material', 'Unquestionable', 'punishing', 'constantly', 'place', 'questionable', 'characters', 'screen', 'are', 'receiving', 'as', 'much', 'audience', 'Despicably', 'bloody', 'violence', 'begets', 'even', 'more', 'wretched', 'bloodshed', 'be', 'inserted', 'scene', 'just', 'sake', 'extremes', 'When', 'done', 'right', 'violence', 'can', 'be', 'entertaining', 'humorous', 'just', 'plain', 'cool', 'War', 'Zone', 'purpose', 'other', 'disgust', 'gloat', 'how', 'excessive', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'wit', 'almost', 'completely', 'devoid', 'slow-motion', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'never', 'flourished', 'shocking', 'brutality', 'exist', 'make', 'use', 'R', 'rating', 'fullest', 'extent.If', 'quality', 'villains', 'was', 'measured', 'positively', 'terribly', 'trite', 'dialogue', 'Punisher', 'War', 'Zone', 'would', 'have', 'greatest', 'cinematic', 'bad', 'guys', 'time', 'Not', 'single', 'utterance', 'original', 'clever', 'major', 'percent', 'flat', 'unnecessary', 'year', 'Hell', 'Ride', 'possibly', 'only', 'other', 'movie', 'history', 'failed', 'badly', 'crafting', 'dialogue', 'tie', 'together', 'action', 'sequences', 'practically', 'nonexistent', 'story', 'atrocious', 'script', 'heroes', 'as', 'well', 'frequently', 'creating', 'ridiculous', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'Frank', 'daughter', 'FBI', 'agent', 'accidentally', 'killed', 'anything', 'positive', 'be', 'said', 'new', 'cinematic', 'take', 'Punisher', 'Marvel', 'Lionsgate', 'did', ""n't"", 'shy', 'away', 'harsh', 'violence', 'made', 'most', 'recent', 'versions', 'comic', 'books', 'strictly', 'only.-', 'Massie', 'Twins']",N/A

Are you serious?  The Black Irish guy and his gang?  Give me a break.  Please.  Comedy anyone? Look people you can't act like it's not garbage if you want it taken seriously next time around.  The Punisher is the easiest comic character to translate to film but they keep getting it WRONG.  Why is that?  It's just a guy with guns.  No powers to speak of.  This is made like those silly Crank and Transporter movies.  At least they know it's all about action parodies and they don't take themselves seriously.  They need to take Frank Castle SERIOUSLY.  This movie was a bad joke.  Rated R was a good move but get BETTER writers and BETTER directors.  The violence was way over the top, unrealistic and tasteless. Blade 2 was gory and the latest Rambo was gory but I must say they were done with RESPECT for the characters and serious as a heart attack.  I love those 2 movies.  The Punisher War Zone reminded me of those B action flicks of the 70's and 80's that were all over cable.  They were parodies of legit films.  Those old enough know what I'm talking about when I say B flicks on cable.  But the directors knew that and we knew that.  They tried to pass this off as A list material.  It's not.  B flick to the core.  No wonder it didn't make any money in the theater.  This is a shameful movie attempt.  Slapped us comic geeks right in the face and maybe killed this franchise FOREVER with this movie.  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1,I'm sorry but this was bad.

1230550,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B001QB9H1U,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","""Punisher: War Zone"" follows the story of Frank Castle aka ""The Punisher."" Unlike Batman, another comic-book hero, Punisher never hesitates to distribute punishment to bad guys in the street and his punishment always means killing. In the third adaptation (co-produced by Lions Gate Films known for its ""Saw"" franchise"") The Punisher confronts the most formidable enemy called ""Jigsaw"" (no, not that guy in ""Saw""), who swears revenge on our (anti-)hero for what happened in the nasty incident.Replacing Thomas Jane who played the titular character in the 2004 adaptation, Ray Stevenson becomes Frank Castle/The Punisher fighting the villains of the city. This time The Punisher, feeling responsible for what he had done in his action, has one more thing to accomplish, that is, to protect an FBI agent's widow Angela (Julie Benz) and her lovely daughter from vengeful Jigsaw (Dominic West) and his brother Loony Bin Jim (scenery chewing Doug Hutchison). The simple story with (intentionally I guess) corny dialogues is just OK, if nothing great.The most memorable aspect of the film is naturally its violence. You either love or hate Lexi Alexander's (""Green Street Hooligans"") over-the-top direction during the film's action sequences. Some blame her for gratuitous violence, but maybe the whole point of ""The Punisher"" is the gratuitous violence itself. Still, I for one was not impressed with the film's actions very much, not because of the excessive amount of gores and body counts (what did you expect from the film called ""The Punisher""?), but because of the lack of style during the action sequences. With the exception of the lurid red lighting, blown-off heads and mutilated bodies (I don't say I disagree with them), and occasional dark humor, the new ""Punisher"" adds little to the action genre.And any effort to humanize the hero (like Bruce Wayne in Christopher Nolan's ""Batman"" films) only slows down the story. In fact the film gets unnecessarily sentimental at times when the camera shows the little girl and her mother. Though I enjoyed watching the film, I think this could be something different.",3,Average Action Film with Violence and Gores,1240963200,"04 29, 2009",2009,2115,"['Punisher', 'War', 'Zone', 'story', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'Punisher', 'Batman', 'comic-book', 'hero', 'Punisher', 'never', 'distribute', 'punishment', 'bad', 'guys', 'street', 'punishment', 'always', 'killing', 'third', 'adaptation', 'co-produced', 'Lions', 'Gate', 'Films', 'known', 'Saw', 'franchise', 'Punisher', 'most', 'formidable', 'enemy', 'called', 'Jigsaw', 'not', 'guy', 'Saw', 'who', 'revenge', 'anti-', 'hero', 'what', 'happened', 'nasty', 'incident.Replacing', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'who', 'played', 'titular', 'character', '2004', 'adaptation', 'Ray', 'Stevenson', 'Frank', 'Castle/The', 'Punisher', 'fighting', 'villains', 'city', 'time', 'Punisher', 'feeling', 'responsible', 'what', 'had', 'done', 'action', 'one', 'more', 'thing', 'accomplish', 'protect', 'FBI', 'agent', 'widow', 'Angela', 'Julie', 'Benz', 'lovely', 'daughter', 'vengeful', 'Jigsaw', 'Dominic', 'West', 'brother', 'Loony', 'Bin', 'Jim', 'scenery', 'chewing', 'Doug', 'Hutchison', 'simple', 'story', 'intentionally', 'guess', 'corny', 'dialogues', 'just', 'OK', 'nothing', 'great.The', 'most', 'memorable', 'aspect', 'film', 'naturally', 'violence', 'love', 'hate', 'Lexi', 'Alexander', 'Green', 'Street', 'Hooligans', 'over-the-top', 'direction', 'film', 'action', 'sequences', 'blame', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'maybe', 'whole', 'point', 'Punisher', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'Still', 'one', 'was', 'not', 'impressed', 'film', 'actions', 'very', 'much', 'not', 'excessive', 'amount', 'gores', 'body', 'counts', 'what', 'did', 'expect', 'film', 'called', 'Punisher', 'lack', 'style', 'action', 'sequences', 'exception', 'lurid', 'red', 'lighting', 'blown-off', 'heads', 'mutilated', 'bodies', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'disagree', 'occasional', 'dark', 'humor', 'new', 'Punisher', 'little', 'action', 'effort', 'humanize', 'hero', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'Batman', 'films', 'only', 'down', 'story', 'fact', 'film', 'unnecessarily', 'sentimental', 'times', 'when', 'camera', 'little', 'girl', 'mother', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'film', 'think', 'could', 'be', 'something', 'different']",N/A

Thomas Jane did such more justice to the character.  I could believe Jane's angst and drive, but Stevenson looks like he's about to cry in every scene.  I miss Thomas Jane and I wish audiences would have responded the way I have, because this display of the Punisher, is Frankly embarassing.If anyone deserves credit, it's the villains and the art direction.  I liked the color pallet as well as some action.  Dominic West and Doug Hutchinson are really fun to watch as villains.Here's What Went WrongRay Stevenson is not hardcore.  He's mopey and not realistic.Punisher's relationship with the woman and little girl needed a lot more work.  I doubt a man in a full black outfit in the middle of the night can generate a warm conversation with a child.  How did she not get frightened by him or her mother pointing a gun in his face?  Good campy is The Spirit.  This is bad campyThe action gets sloppy and everyone starts feeling like clay.  Necks become as fragile as feathers.  The first, well technically second, Punisher was practical and its action scenes had realistic carnage.  Punisher: War Zone seems like Saw on cocaine.The acrobats.  I shouldn't even get started.  They are professional overactors.The writers really need to come up with material that doesn't insult my intelligence as a comic book fan.  Comics are very smart works of art.  Writing does not increase your budget.  Use the brain inside your skull.Lionsgate must find a happy medium between these two films if we are to see any more of the Punisher.  What this film did well is create interesting villains for the Punisher.  It would have been outstanding to see them in another Jonathan Hensleigh directed, Thomas Jane Punisher.  They had all the right hope and ideas, they were just not well produced.  We like Wolverine and the Punisher because they are the most indomitable men in the heat of every battle.  Ray Stevenson appeared dominated from the get-go.  Please take your next Punisher, if there is one, more delicately.

This isn't really saying much, but the movie was a little better than I expected.Frank Castle (Ray Stevenson, Rome) is the Punisher, a vigilante who executes criminals as his own brand of justice. Now he sets his sights on a crime boss named Billy Russoti ( Dominic West). When a gunfight goes awry, and an undercover F.B.I. agent is killed, Frank is left to ponder his purpose. However, this encounter also left Russoti a little insane, as he is left disfigured after being left in the glass grinder now calls himself ""Jigsaw"". Now re-birthed as Jigsaw, the crime boss sets his sights on the undercover agent's widow, Angela (Julie Benz) and his kid and plots vengeance on Castle with the aid of his insane brother Loony Bin Jim (Doug Hutchison). Castle has no choice but to protect the widow--and an obsessed F.B.I. agent (played by Colin Salmon) closing in for the arrest...""Punisher Warzone"" is light years away from truly groundbreaking cinema, but it is a lot better than the other films based on the character. Irish actor Ray Stevenson resembles the artistic renditions in some of the covers of the legendary comic book and I found the actor very fit for the role. Stevenson does have the necessary grit and personality for the role--a single-minded purpose that is supposed to be unstoppable and very determined. Now, that I've gotten that out of the way, the film's screenplay just moves along like a comic book, or rather what most folks think how comic book movie should play out. The film's acting, cinematography, and atmosphere just exudes ""comic book"" and seemed to have forgotten that it is now a film. The direction by Lexi Alexander is actually decent but spends too much effort in playing into the impulse to prove that it is adapted from a comic book. This may not be a bad thing, but what resulted is a less than stellar script, obligatory dialogue and one-dimensional cardboard characters with hardly any emotion.The acting of the supporting cast are pretty weak, aside from Dominic West who plays the over-the-top villain, and the accents actually did bother me a little bit. I thought certain elements in the script by Nick Santura and Art Marcum lacked coherency and full of inconsistency, one moment the film reveals its darkly inspired motifs, throws in some scenes for emotion and then one minute it is so comical; I really thought the recruitment scenes of Jigsaw was well out of place. I do think the film missed its potentials for dramatic impact as the film's emotions lacked exposition. Castle's contrasting approaches to agent Dubinsky (Colin Salmon), a man who upholds the system was somewhat explored but underdeveloped; that it feels too perfunctory. All in all the film is pretty routine, the script isn't horrible but it wasn't polished and offers nothing memorable or any surprises.So what made me like this film a whole lot better than its predecessors? The film is immensely violent and brutal--and may I say quite BLOODY AND GORY. The Punisher is a character without powers (unlike Spider-man), nor does have high-tech resources (unlike Iron Man), and while his reasons may be similar to a certain Dark Knight, as to the lost of his family--he lacks the time to properly train and channel his anger. So, Castle does what he does best--to maim, intimidate and kill. Director Alexander (oh, wow! She's female) gives us all the gory details. I was also pleased that the CGI visual effects are kept to a minimum, and the director cleverly relies on the use of puppets, prosthetics and red ink to deliver the gore EFX . Criminals are beheaded, impaled, blown up to pieces with ruthless indignation. The gunfights are pretty fast and nicely placed, but of course it does lack realism in some aspects.Ultimately, ""Punisher Warzone"" isn't a good film, actually it is pretty bad--but it does qualify as being so bad that it is GOOD. I still think that the Punisher being a character who has no super-powers, who deals with the criminal underworld, to be more grounded and more closely linked to realism--Castle is NOT a superhero but a very human vigilante. While the film should have scaled back on the comic-bookish feel that relied on fans of the comic to fill in the plot gaps and instead concentrated on character developments to inspire the humanity of Castle's character (even Jigsaw's) then this film would've been really great.Still, considering the quality of the past ""Punisher"" films, this movie is a lot better. It is wildly entertaining, that allowed me to look pass the weaknesses of the script and the perfunctory elements by allowing for a lot of blood, GORE and ""campy"" mayhem to take over. So do I recommend the film? It is brainless entertainment and while ""Punisher: Warzone"" could have been a lot better, thankfully it wasn't a whole lot worst. Scale back on your expectations and you may like it.Recommended with Caution, RENT IT!first[2 +Stars]",3,Brainless Action Movie But the B-movie Blood and Gore Does Entertain!!,1237248000,"03 17,
