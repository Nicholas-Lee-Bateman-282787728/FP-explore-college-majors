1177537,A30QSLHX2HC9GE,B001CT8762,Aaron Von Raschke,"[4, 10]","RED is about a lonely old man named Avery (Brian Cox) who's minding his own business one day at the river with his dog, Red, and doing some fishing when a couple of teenagers armed with a shotgun show up, harass the him, and then kill his dog for no reason. Heartbroken, Avery goes to the Police and due to no witnesses and no evidence, nothing will be done about it. So he takes matters into his own hands. He meets a news reporter who believes in his story and puts this case on the news so that it gets peoples attention. Unfortunately it gets the attention of the father of two of the teenagers (Tom Sizemore) and, of course, the teens. What follows is a whole lot of nothing.Going into this movie, I thought it was going to be about revenge. And during the film, when seeing Avery's story unfold (a horrific family tragedy and now his dog, and only companion, being killed), I thought it would be a matter of time before he snapped and pulled aMichael Douglas. Plus the antagonists (Sizemore and especially the teenagers) were so unlikeable, that I figured it was a perfect setup to lure the audience into WANTING Avery to go bananas and not just avenge the death of his dog but to do so in a gruesome manner. Sure it's silly to think that someone would take another human life over a dog. But Avery is someone who has nothing to lose. So what happens when you take away the only thing that a man who has nothing to lose cares about? Well, apparently nothing. I waited and waited and waited. And nothing happened. Throughout the film Avery is the victim and is always the underdog (no pun intended). His character is weak and his actions are just... normal. He doesn't go off the deep end like you would think and the film walks a pretty straight path throughout. He shows hints of ""going there"" but ultimately doesn't, thus resulting in an extremely disappointing and boring film.The film quality is very good and is shot well. The cast was great. Brian Cox did an excellent job, however his character was just boring. Sizemore, who is normally fantastic at playing unlikeable (or even likeable) psychos, actually seems pretty tame in this film. Robert Englund (NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET) and Amanda Plummer play the parents of the third teenager. Ashley Laurence (HELLRAISER) plays Sizemore's wife and mother of two of the boys. So we have a great cast, two stars from CLASSIC Horror films in the movie, and the film is co-Directed by one of Horror's best up and coming Directors, Lucky McKee (MAY, THE WOODS). So why the low rating? Well, for one the pace was VERY slow. However, the short length (90 minutes) keeps it from dragging on for too long. And the overall outcome of the story was just super disappointing. It wasn't at all what I thought it was going to be. I had read a lot of good reviews about this movie and ultimately didn't see what the big deal is. I would RECOMMEND it in hopes that someone else may like it and enjoy it, but personally I wouldn't watch it again.The DVD Extra Features are a few Deleted Scenes and a short interview with lead actor Brian Cox.2 stars",2,Boring and disappointing.,1228521600,"12 6, 2008",2008,3091,"['RED', 'lonely', 'old', 'man', 'named', 'Avery', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'who', 'minding', 'own', 'business', 'one', 'day', 'river', 'dog', 'Red', 'doing', 'fishing', 'when', 'couple', 'teenagers', 'armed', 'shotgun', 'show', 'up', 'harass', 'then', 'kill', 'dog', 'reason', 'Heartbroken', 'Avery', 'Police', 'due', 'witnesses', 'evidence', 'nothing', 'will', 'be', 'done', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'news', 'reporter', 'who', 'story', 'case', 'news', 'peoples', 'attention', 'Unfortunately', 'attention', 'father', 'two', 'teenagers', 'Tom', 'Sizemore', 'course', 'teens', 'What', 'whole', 'lot', 'nothing.Going', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'revenge', 'film', 'when', 'seeing', 'Avery', 'story', 'unfold', 'horrific', 'family', 'tragedy', 'now', 'dog', 'only', 'companion', 'being', 'killed', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'matter', 'time', 'snapped', 'pulled', 'aMichael', 'Douglas', 'antagonists', 'Sizemore', 'especially', 'teenagers', 'were', 'so', 'unlikeable', 'figured', 'was', 'perfect', 'setup', 'lure', 'audience', 'WANTING', 'Avery', 'go', 'bananas', 'not', 'just', 'avenge', 'death', 'dog', 'do', 'so', 'gruesome', 'manner', 'Sure', 'silly', 'think', 'someone', 'would', 'take', 'human', 'life', 'dog', 'Avery', 'someone', 'who', 'nothing', 'lose', 'what', 'when', 'take', 'away', 'only', 'thing', 'man', 'who', 'nothing', 'lose', 'cares', 'Well', 'apparently', 'nothing', 'waited', 'waited', 'waited', 'nothing', 'happened', 'film', 'Avery', 'victim', 'always', 'underdog', 'pun', 'intended', 'character', 'weak', 'actions', 'are', 'just', 'normal', ""n't"", 'go', 'off', 'deep', 'end', 'would', 'think', 'film', 'pretty', 'straight', 'path', 'hints', 'going', 'there', 'ultimately', ""n't"", 'thus', 'resulting', 'extremely', 'disappointing', 'boring', 'film.The', 'film', 'quality', 'very', 'good', 'shot', 'well', 'cast', 'was', 'great', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'however', 'character', 'was', 'just', 'boring', 'Sizemore', 'who', 'normally', 'fantastic', 'playing', 'unlikeable', 'even', 'likeable', 'psychos', 'actually', 'pretty', 'tame', 'film', 'Robert', 'Englund', 'NIGHTMARE', 'ON', 'ELM', 'STREET', 'Amanda', 'Plummer', 'play', 'parents', 'third', 'teenager', 'Ashley', 'Laurence', 'HELLRAISER', 'Sizemore', 'wife', 'mother', 'two', 'boys', 'have', 'great', 'cast', 'two', 'stars', 'CLASSIC', 'Horror', 'films', 'movie', 'film', 'co-Directed', 'one', 'Horror', 'best', 'up', 'coming', 'Directors', 'Lucky', 'McKee', 'MAY', 'THE', 'WOODS', 'So', 'why', 'low', 'rating', 'Well', 'one', 'pace', 'was', 'VERY', 'slow', 'However', 'short', 'length', '90', 'minutes', 'keeps', 'dragging', 'too', 'long', 'overall', 'outcome', 'story', 'was', 'just', 'super', 'disappointing', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'had', 'read', 'lot', 'good', 'reviews', 'movie', 'ultimately', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'big', 'deal', 'would', 'RECOMMEND', 'hopes', 'someone', 'else', 'may', 'like', 'enjoy', 'personally', 'would', ""n't"", 'watch', 'again.The', 'DVD', 'Extra', 'Features', 'are', 'few', 'Deleted', 'Scenes', 'short', 'interview', 'lead', 'actor', 'Brian', 'Cox.2', 'stars']",Red

But it must have been fate, because I accidentally rented it tonight with the intention of seeing the new movie by the same name with Morgan Freeman, Bruce Willis, John Malkovich, et al.I knew from past experience that Amazon would have cancelled the rental and reimbursed my fee, but I decided to go ahead and bite the bullet. I literally cringed when I pushed the play button because I knew what was coming! Thankfully I was alone, because ten minutes into it I was sobbing. If you've seen this and think I sound overly dramatic, then I can only assume that you've never experienced the love and companionship of an animal ... or the crushing loss when they move on.I'm glad I finally watched this, and I think it's good to let down your guard and allow a story to be told no matter how painful it is to take in. It's an outstanding film with a cast of excellent actors who I believe deserve a lot more recognition than many of them have been given. I recognized most of them from their strong ""supporting"" roles in blockbuster hits  - with the exception of Robert Englund - because he's been hidden behind the mask of Freddie Krueger so many times!I have no doubt I'll watch this again, just as I've re-read books and seen movies multiple times which moved me so deeply that I'm willing to experience despair in order to relive the impact the story had on me. Many times a story is most effectively communicated through brutal honesty and raw emotion.P.S.

1177544,A18D0R137EYS6C,B001CT8762,Clinton Enlow,"[13, 15]","I've read only two Jack Ketchum novels, the writer on who's book this film was adapted. Both were the Off novels which read like The Hills Have Eyes with brutality and suspense handed out in something that plays like a really good explotaiton horror piece. Ketchum's work has started being adapted a lot with the Off series next after this film, The Lost and The Girl Next Door. From Ketchum's work I'll admit that I never expected something like this though as its not a lurid piece and I found it a rather interesting spin on the idea of the revenge thriller.Bear in mind that this film is not an Oldboy or Man on Fire. It begins with the main character Avery Ludlow being confronted by the three youths, Danny and Harold and their friend Pete. Danny a bully with a gun wanting to shoot something taunts Avery before shooting Red, Ludlows old dog. Ludlow angered by the shooting and wanting an apology goes to Danny's father Michael McCormack who taking the word of his son over the old man basically tells him off. But Avery wants whats right. He takes his problem to the law who can't do anything about the matter and tell him that Michael's Lawyers can keep Danny from facing any kind of punishment. He gets help from a journalist and soon Danny and Michael are both threatening violence. Soon backed into corner and harrassed Avery takes matters further inciting violence from the McCormacks despite Harold the younger bullied son who wants to do whats right.I really liked this film far much more than I would. Theres a lot to be said from the simplicity of the direction to the characterization of the three main characters. Most of Ketchum's work I'd best describe as lurid but suprisingly the script from the writer of The Grudge remakes keeps things simple building things up like a slow burn letting the action intensify. It also helps I suppose with the actors involved. Tom Sizemore and Noel Fisher are fine as the villains who are more bullies who don't want to admit weakness to an old man. But this is Brian Cox's film in my opinion. Cox is one of the best living actors in my opinion someone who its always a pleasure to watch be it in Super Troopers or Manhunter-where his performance as Hannibal Lector trounces Anthony Hopkins easily. Here he presents an earnest old man who doesn't want the violence that happens but won't let the McCormacks have their way. Its one of the better performances of its kind nicely dialed down but still capable of anger. I'll say one thing though. Theres a monologue delivered by Cox in the middle of the film which to me was one of the best moments of any film this year. Its a quiet moment where He delivers a small speech about his family that doesn't revert to flashback but quietly explores his modest home ending on his face as He relates a tragedy that befell him. Its a great scene earnestly directed and fits with the end as Avery admits the absurdity of the situation.I enjoyed the  film greatly but there was a lack of features that made the disc somewhat of a disappointment. I wanted to say that I highly regard the film but with the lack of features there was also a problem with severe combing in the image that was through the majority of the film which is why I only rated it a four. I'd say rent the film and wait for the price to drop if you like it.

1177545,A2Q42ON9CEHR4O,B001CT8762,David R. Eastwood,"[3, 4]","The main issue of this film is HOW to instill some moral center in one's children so they will become honest, responsible adults. RED presents us with the problem and shows us two wrong answers--and also has the main character, Avery (played by Brian Cox), tell us about a third example of failure: his own, with his own older son.RED isn't a film designed to ""entertain"" us viewers; instead, it is carefully organized to make us think about a serious, real-life matter--and then it leaves it up to us to reach our own conclusions. By NOT providing us with any ""official solution,"" the film deliberately creates a kind of ""thought vacuum"" in our minds that we want to fill with the best answers we can.As everyone probably knows already, the specific instances of antisocial behavior here are (1) the attempted robbery of an old man by a spoiled teenage boy with a shotgun and (2) the gratuitous killing of that man's old dog. When the old man attempts to get ""justice"" (a simple apology from the teenager who pulled the trigger would satisfy him), he runs into an array of obstacles of all sorts. And then ""things"" get much worse. And even worse--until two people are badly wounded, and two more are dead.And then Avery, the old man, does some soul-searching. And a brief, happier scene is presented as the ending.Yes, the issue is important, and this film can be used as a basis for a serious family discussion. The ""extra features"" include intelligent comments by actor Brian Cox which are relevant to such a discussion. (They also include a few ""deleted scenes"" which most viewers will be glad WERE deleted.)In my opinion, the script is quite good (deserving a strong ""B+"" grade); the acting is VERY uneven (deserving about a middling ""B"" grade); and the production values, especially the camera work, are rather weak and amateurish (deserving around a ""C-"" grade).If these factors are weighted equally, the film would get a ""B-""; but if you personally tend to put more emphasis on one or two of these factors, then you might move the overall final grade somewhat higher or lower than that.As for me, I'm a grandparent in my 70s--I've already raised my kids.

In a short interview in the Special Features section of the DVD, lead actor Brian Cox mentions Ketchum's reputation among horror circles and notes that this story, while including some horrific elements, is essentially a drama, rather than a horror genre piece.  Cox is right on the money, and I was not disappointed in the slightest.Red is far more than a basic story of revenge.  The lead character suffers the loss of his long-time canine companion at the hands of teenage thugs.  Rather than fly off the handle, the isolated Avery solemnly, yet insistently merely asks for the boys to acknowledge their misdeed and apologize.  Unfortunately for everyone involved (except us viewers of the film), no such resolution is in the cards.  Things go from bad to worse, and while Avery maintains a relatively cool head throughout, slow to anger, the pacing works just fine and I credit the co-directors with a superior job of effective storytelling.The cast is very good, with veteran actors Amanda Plummer, Robert Englund, Tom Sizemore, and Kim Dickens among others, but this is solidly Brian Cox's film and he delivers memorably, in what is one of his best performances.From casting to writing to directing, Red is a very solid Indie drama that I would recommend not just to fans of Jack Ketchum's novels, but to anyone who appreciates a well told story.",4,Well-Made Effective Drama,1243900800,"06 2, 2009",2009,1449,"['Being', 'somewhat', 'familiar', 'Ketchum', 'work', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'bit', 'more', 'over-the-top', 'short', 'interview', 'Special', 'Features', 'section', 'DVD', 'lead', 'actor', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'mentions', 'Ketchum', 'reputation', 'horror', 'circles', 'notes', 'story', 'including', 'horrific', 'elements', 'essentially', 'drama', 'rather', 'horror', 'genre', 'piece', 'Cox', 'right', 'money', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'slightest.Red', 'far', 'more', 'basic', 'story', 'revenge', 'lead', 'character', 'suffers', 'loss', 'long-time', 'canine', 'companion', 'hands', 'teenage', 'thugs', 'Rather', 'fly', 'off', 'handle', 'isolated', 'Avery', 'solemnly', 'yet', 'insistently', 'merely', 'boys', 'acknowledge', 'misdeed', 'apologize', 'Unfortunately', 'everyone', 'involved', 'viewers', 'film', 'such', 'resolution', 'cards', 'Things', 'go', 'bad', 'worse', 'Avery', 'relatively', 'cool', 'head', 'slow', 'anger', 'pacing', 'just', 'fine', 'credit', 'co-directors', 'superior', 'job', 'effective', 'storytelling.The', 'cast', 'very', 'good', 'veteran', 'actors', 'Amanda', 'Plummer', 'Robert', 'Englund', 'Tom', 'Sizemore', 'Kim', 'Dickens', 'others', 'solidly', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'film', 'memorably', 'what', 'one', 'best', 'performances.From', 'casting', 'writing', 'directing', 'Red', 'very', 'solid', 'Indie', 'drama', 'would', 'recommend', 'not', 'just', 'fans', 'Jack', 'Ketchum', 'novels', 'anyone', 'who', 'well', 'told', 'story']",Red

Barrios,"[42, 45]","I can't comment on the DVD because I only saw the screener for this movie but that makes no difference, except if I wanted to judge the quality of the transfer in terms of video and audio fidelity.Red made official selection for the Sundance Film Festival and deservedly so. Director Lucky McKee's telling of a man seeking justice for the murder of his dog is emotionally gripping yet ultimately satisfying in a Death Wish sort of way. The film works in terms of its directing and acting, which made me feel it's the best independent movie I've seen in a long time and possibly the best movie of 2008--period!Robert Englund's performance, though short, was dead on. I think he's really come far as an actor. I found his portrayal of an unemployed carpenter, who happens to be the father of one of the three teens who shot Ludlow's dog, to be very convincing. He's matured as an actor and should do more roles outside of horror.Tom Sizemore does a good job playing the evil father of the boy who shot the dog. He's your typical hunter-businessman who beats his wife and rules his household with authority. In other words, his morality is always at an all-time low.Brian Cox, of course, stole the show with his role as the owner of Red. As a viewer, I felt convinced that he really lost his dog. In fact, so much so, that it got to the point where I wanted to jump into the television screen and help him get those suckers.I will definitely own the DVD when it comes out. I can't imagine not adding this to my collection.If you own a dog and think of it as being more than just a dog, perhaps more like a member of your family, you'll find this a difficult watch but bearable.Those who are for animal rights in all forms will definitely find that your quota of vengeance will have been filled after seeing this poignant film.",5,In a word: Unbelievable!,1222387200,"09 26, 2008",2008,1823,"['ca', ""n't"", 'comment', 'DVD', 'only', 'saw', 'screener', 'movie', 'difference', 'wanted', 'judge', 'quality', 'transfer', 'terms', 'video', 'audio', 'fidelity.Red', 'made', 'official', 'selection', 'Sundance', 'Film', 'Festival', 'deservedly', 'so', 'Director', 'Lucky', 'McKee', 'telling', 'man', 'seeking', 'justice', 'murder', 'dog', 'emotionally', 'gripping', 'yet', 'ultimately', 'satisfying', 'Death', 'Wish', 'sort', 'way', 'film', 'terms', 'directing', 'acting', 'made', 'feel', 'best', 'independent', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'possibly', 'best', 'movie', '2008', 'period', 'Robert', 'Englund', 'performance', 'short', 'was', 'dead', 'think', 'really', 'come', 'far', 'actor', 'found', 'portrayal', 'unemployed', 'carpenter', 'who', 'be', 'father', 'one', 'three', 'teens', 'who', 'shot', 'Ludlow', 'dog', 'be', 'very', 'convincing', 'matured', 'actor', 'should', 'do', 'more', 'roles', 'horror.Tom', 'Sizemore', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'evil', 'father', 'boy', 'who', 'dog', 'typical', 'hunter-businessman', 'who', 'wife', 'rules', 'household', 'authority', 'other', 'words', 'morality', 'always', 'all-time', 'low.Brian', 'Cox', 'course', 'stole', 'show', 'role', 'owner', 'Red', 'viewer', 'felt', 'convinced', 'really', 'lost', 'dog', 'fact', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'got', 'point', 'where', 'wanted', 'jump', 'television', 'screen', 'help', 'get', 'suckers.I', 'will', 'definitely', 'own', 'DVD', 'when', 'out', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'not', 'adding', 'collection.If', 'own', 'dog', 'think', 'being', 'more', 'just', 'dog', 'perhaps', 'more', 'member', 'family', ""'ll"", 'find', 'difficult', 'watch', 'bearable.Those', 'who', 'are', 'animal', 'rights', 'forms', 'will', 'definitely', 'find', 'quota', 'vengeance', 'will', 'have', 'been', 'filled', 'seeing', 'poignant', 'film']",Red
1177548,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B001CT8762,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[2, 2]","RED (2008, 96 minutes) is a tour de force for British actor Brian Cox, who plays the gentle Oregon store owner/widower Avery ""Av"" Allen Ludlow. After the killing of his dog, Red, Ludlow goes on a sort of quest, first for the truth instead of lies, an apology and an explanation - later for a reckoning of some kind. Not so silly as it sounds, because his beloved dog is representative of a great deal.With no help from the law (the great Richard Riehle who I am always confusing with Brain Doyle-Murray) and with the two McCormack brothers running around free (the evil Danny, played by Noel Fisher, and hapless brother Harold played by Kyle Gallner) ... what is a man to do?This amazing film, with a haunting soundtrack that had hammer-dulcimer music to add to its emotional creepiness, is meant to play out slight differently according to each viewer. While it bothered me to see the film succumb to the obvious fade-to-red a few times (something I just saw copied in a more recent film), the acting is pitch-perfect, the emotions very harrowing, and the story properly balanced.Cox, as a former soldier, war vet and hero, is slowly and horribly pushed over the edge of reason toward the film's end when the little bastard burns down his store. Cox's eyes flash with the anger, terror, desperation and insanity that no one deserves. The poor man is still searching for the reason his older son took the lives of his younger son and wife. At its worst, the only thing I can say of it is it reminds me of some of the best drama of the 1970s.This represents one pillar of such-like filmsHarry BrownandGran Torino(see my reviews for those) and I feel now that there is a complete triumvirate with RED. Talk about sad: cinema today is simply unbalanced, unfair and stupid. The budget of this movie was $2.5 million but it grossed less than $3,200. That's right: less than $3,200.Not to be confused with 2010's comic action filmRed(in which Cox also starred, see my review), this has the terrific talents of Tom Sizemore, Robert Englund, Shiloh Fernandez, and Amanda Plummer.",5,Man is a wolf to man,1342915200,"07 22, 2012",2012,2071,"['RED', '2008', '96', 'minutes', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'British', 'actor', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'who', 'gentle', 'Oregon', 'store', 'owner/widower', 'Avery', 'Av', 'Allen', 'Ludlow', 'killing', 'dog', 'Red', 'Ludlow', 'sort', 'quest', 'first', 'truth', 'instead', 'lies', 'apology', 'explanation', 'later', 'reckoning', 'kind', 'Not', 'so', 'silly', 'beloved', 'dog', 'representative', 'great', 'deal.With', 'help', 'law', 'great', 'Richard', 'Riehle', 'who', 'am', 'always', 'confusing', 'Brain', 'Doyle-Murray', 'two', 'McCormack', 'brothers', 'running', 'around', 'free', 'evil', 'Danny', 'played', 'Noel', 'Fisher', 'hapless', 'brother', 'Harold', 'played', 'Kyle', 'Gallner', 'what', 'man', 'do', 'amazing', 'film', 'haunting', 'soundtrack', 'had', 'hammer-dulcimer', 'music', 'add', 'emotional', 'creepiness', 'meant', 'play', 'out', 'slight', 'differently', 'according', 'viewer', 'bothered', 'see', 'film', 'succumb', 'obvious', 'fade-to-red', 'few', 'times', 'something', 'just', 'saw', 'copied', 'more', 'recent', 'film', 'acting', 'pitch-perfect', 'emotions', 'very', 'harrowing', 'story', 'properly', 'balanced.Cox', 'former', 'soldier', 'war', 'vet', 'hero', 'slowly', 'horribly', 'pushed', 'edge', 'reason', 'film', 'end', 'when', 'little', 'bastard', 'down', 'store', 'Cox', 'eyes', 'flash', 'anger', 'terror', 'desperation', 'insanity', 'one', 'poor', 'man', 'still', 'searching', 'reason', 'older', 'son', 'took', 'lives', 'younger', 'son', 'wife', 'worst', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'best', 'drama', '1970s.This', 'one', 'pillar', 'such-like', 'filmsHarry', 'BrownandGran', 'Torino', 'see', 'reviews', 'feel', 'now', 'complete', 'triumvirate', 'RED', 'Talk', 'sad', 'cinema', 'today', 'simply', 'unbalanced', 'unfair', 'stupid', 'budget', 'movie', 'was', '2.5', 'million', 'grossed', 'less', '3,200', 'right', 'less', '3,200.Not', 'be', 'confused', '2010', 'comic', 'action', 'filmRed', 'Cox', 'also', 'starred', 'see', 'review', 'terrific', 'talents', 'Tom', 'Sizemore', 'Robert', 'Englund', 'Shiloh', 'Fernandez', 'Amanda', 'Plummer']",Red

Avery Ludlow is awoken by his trustworthy dog, Red. After feeding Red his breakfast in the doggy dish, it's time to go get some fish bait from Emma (Marcia Bennett) at the General Store, which he owns, and then do some fishing. Avery and his dog are relaxing at the lake. Avery has a keen sense of smell. He smells cologne. Coming through the woods to the lake are three bad teenage kids, Danny (Noel Fisher), Harold (Kyle Gallner) and Pete (Shiloh Fernandez). Danny talks with an attitude to Avery, but Avery remains calm. He tries to tell Danny that he shouldn't wear cologne in the woods if he's hunting. Danny wants to know how much money Avery has and points a rifle at him. After Danny continues to smart-off to Avery, he suddenly shoots 14-year old Red and goes off.After Avery buries his dog, he does a little investigating and traces the rifle Danny used to a gun shop and finds out the residence of where Danny lives. After talking to the father (Tom Sizemore) first about the situation, Danny walks in the room and completely lies about having a gun, the clothes he wore hunting and shooting a dog.  The father says to Avery he must have the wrong kids.Avery goes to an attorney, Sam (Richard Riehle). Avery says it was attempted robbery. The attorney says he can't prove it. It's his word against theirs. It's just cruelty to animals. Sam tells him the Sheriff would of had to see the trigger pulled. Avery wants to fully prosecute the three boys for the crime and request 364 days in jail. The District Attorney won't go forward with the case. Avery wants justice.Excellent performance by Brian Cox as ""Avery"".

THIS MAN WAS NOT AN IMPULSIVE CHARACTER WHO WOULD EXPLODE IN A SECOND OF RAGE. HE WAS CALM WITH RESOLVE THROUGHOUT THIS OUTSTANDING CINEMATIC TREAT, NOT LIKE THE MAIN CHARACTER IN ""WALKING TALL"". THESE TWO MOVIES ARE SO UNLIKE THAT IT IS SAD THAT THE INDIVIDUAL WHO WROTE THAT REVIEW DIDN'T FEEL WHAT MOST FELT, SAD THAT HE IS SO COVERED WITH AN EMOTIONAL WALL THAT WAS TOO DENSE TO PENETRATE. I LOVED IT, I LOVED IT, I LOVED IT!!!ONE REVIEWER SAID THE PACE WAS SLOW AND THE MAIN CHARACTER WAS BORING.Why does a character have to be impulsive and in a maniacle rage for an entire movie for him not to be ""boring"". Actually it was quite refreshing, so different because it showed a man could be quiet and strong with resolve without going on a bloody rampage like every other boring and trite, repetitive as in cinematic garbage, that is filmed over and over without anything new to offer an intelligent viewer. The acting was superb and the pace reflected the main character's personality. Because he was sensitive and controlled he represented another human dynamic so unfamiliar to the big screen that it's power was a needed rest from the usual and predictable ""Walking Tall"" and the like.",5,COULDN'T TURN IT OFF!,1341273600,"07 3, 2012",2012,2141,"['LOST', 'TRACK', 'OF', 'HOW', 'MANY', 'CABLE', 'MOVIES', 'TURNED', 'OFF', 'IN', 'LESS', 'THAN', '15', 'MINUTES', 'BUT', 'THIS', 'WAS', 'DIFFERENT', 'WATCHED', 'THIS', 'TIRED', 'OLD', 'DOG', 'AND', 'GENTLE', 'MAN', 'AND', 'KEPT', 'IT', 'ON', 'A', 'WHILE', 'LONGER', 'WAS', 'REWARDED', 'BY', 'THAT', 'DECISION.THE', 'ACTING', 'WAS', 'SUPERB', 'AND', 'THE', 'STORY', 'WAS', 'RICH', 'WITH', 'SUSPENSE', 'THE', 'POWER', 'A', 'MAN', 'WHO', 'HAD', 'LOST', 'EVERYTHING', 'ALL', 'HE', 'WANTED', 'WAS', 'TO', 'LIVE', 'HIS', 'LIFE', 'IN', 'PEACE', 'WITH', 'HIS', 'TRUSTED', 'FRIEND', 'RED', 'AT', 'HIS', 'SIDE', 'A', '14', 'YR', 'OLD', 'CANINE', 'WHO', 'WAS', 'GIVEN', 'TO', 'HIM', 'BY', 'HIS', 'LATE', 'WIFE', 'THEN', 'HE', 'RAN', 'INTO', 'A', 'TROUBLED', 'TEEN', 'WHO', 'OUT', 'WITH', 'ANGER', 'AND', 'UNCONTROLLABLE', 'RAGE', 'THAT', 'MOST', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'UNDERSTAND', 'THEN', 'WITH', 'ONE', 'BULLET', ""'RED"", 'WAS', 'GONE.THIS', 'WAS', 'A', 'QUIET', 'MAN', 'BUT', 'HE', 'WAS', 'NOT', 'WEAK', 'STRONG', 'IN', 'WAYS', 'THAT', 'MOST', 'WOULD', 'NOT', 'IMAGINE', 'IF', 'YOU', 'DID', ""N'T"", 'HAVE', 'TEAR', 'IN', 'YOUR', 'EYE', 'AT', 'THE', 'END', 'YOUR', 'LIFE', 'IS', 'MISSING', 'SOMETHING', 'ONE', 'REVIEWER', 'COMPARED', 'THIS', 'MOVIE', 'TO', 'WALKING', 'TALL', 'THIS', 'PICTURE', 'WAS', 'SO', 'MUCH', 'BETTER', 'SO', 'MUCH', 'MORE', 'TEMPTING', 'IN', 'THE', 'SENSE', 'IT', 'TWISTED', 'AND', 'TURNED', 'IN', 'UNSUSPECTING', 'WAYS', 'THIS', 'MAN', 'WAS', 'NOT', 'AN', 'IMPULSIVE', 'CHARACTER', 'WHO', 'WOULD', 'EXPLODE', 'IN', 'A', 'SECOND', 'OF', 'RAGE', 'HE', 'WAS', 'CALM', 'WITH', 'RESOLVE', 'THROUGHOUT', 'THIS', 'OUTSTANDING', 'CINEMATIC', 'TREAT', 'NOT', 'LIKE', 'THE', 'MAIN', 'CHARACTER', 'IN', 'WALKING', 'TALL', 'THESE', 'TWO', 'MOVIES', 'ARE', 'SO', 'THAT', 'IT', 'IS', 'SAD', 'THE', 'INDIVIDUAL', 'WHO', 'WROTE', 'THAT', 'REVIEW', 'DID', ""N'T"", 'FEEL', 'WHAT', 'MOST', 'FELT', 'SAD', 'HE', 'IS', 'SO', 'COVERED', 'WITH', 'AN', 'EMOTIONAL', 'WALL', 'THAT', 'WAS', 'TOO', 'DENSE', 'TO', 'PENETRATE', 'LOVED', 'IT', 'LOVED', 'IT', 'LOVED', 'IT', 'ONE', 'REVIEWER', 'SAID', 'THE', 'PACE', 'WAS', 'SLOW', 'THE', 'MAIN', 'CHARACTER', 'WAS', 'BORING.Why', 'character', 'have', 'be', 'impulsive', 'maniacle', 'rage', 'entire', 'movie', 'not', 'be', 'boring', 'Actually', 'was', 'quite', 'refreshing', 'so', 'different', 'showed', 'man', 'could', 'be', 'quiet', 'strong', 'resolve', 'going', 'bloody', 'rampage', 'other', 'boring', 'trite', 'repetitive', 'cinematic', 'garbage', 'filmed', 'anything', 'new', 'offer', 'intelligent', 'viewer', 'acting', 'was', 'superb', 'pace', 'reflected', 'main', 'character', 'personality', 'was', 'sensitive', 'controlled', 'represented', 'human', 'dynamic', 'so', 'unfamiliar', 'big', 'screen', 'power', 'was', 'needed', 'rest', 'usual', 'predictable', 'Walking', 'Tall', 'like']",Red
1177557,A1H89KJ9KF1SB9,B001CT8762,"Kody Boye ""Horror Author""","[0, 0]","Everyone says the dog is man's best friend.For Avery Ludlow, nothing can be further from the truth.For the past fourteen years, Red has been his constant companion. Waking up in the same bed, trips to Av's local convenient store, trips down to the river--no matter where Avery is, Red is sure to follow, an old companion to an even older soul.Then, one day, everything changes.Happening upon the scene by pure chance, three boys--Danny, Harold and Pete--are about to change Av's life forever.There's nothing like the bitter aftertaste of an unexpected visit to disturb the peace of a silent moment, so when Danny McCormack decides to take things to a twisted, dangerous level, things are bound to go out of hand.The boys want three things--money, valuables, and Av's car.Av wants one thing--peace.When both parties get neither, an innocent creature falls to the cruelty of man.Shot in the head at close range by a Browning shotgun, Red is dead within minutes.The boys left with nothing.Av will leave with something more than the body of his dead dog.He'll leave with revenge on his mind.Written by one of the twenty-first century's masters of horror and adapted to screen by the man that wrote The Grudge, RED is an inspiringly-violent film with beautiful, extravagant emotion. Faced with the all-too-real reality of the death of his dog, RED will force you to watch a man that will stop at nothing in order to get the justice his dog deserves, even if it means taking unconventional ways to do it.Quite honestly, there is very little to complain about the film adaptation of one of Jack Ketchum's most amazing novels.-- The ensemble cast of Brian Cox (Avery Ludlow,) the boys (Noel Fisher, Kyle Galler, Shiloh Fernandez,) and Danny McCormack's father (Tom Sizemore) is one of the most outstanding features of the movie. Even when you think that children aren't capable of committing such violent, atrocious acts, Noel Fisher forces you to believe that he is capable of committing one of the most violent, atrocious acts known to man without little more than a smirk. Obscure vanity and overt trust on Tom Sizemore's behalf lets you see the amazing bigotry caused by over-idealized expectations a father has for his son, and Kim Dickens (who played Carrie the news reporter) manages to give you the slightest hope that there really is good out there, regardless of all the wrong in the world.-- The fine execution of the story is outstanding--brilliant, even. Though not all characters are fleshed out in the way that should be expected (nor are their roles transferred in the exact way they were in the book,) those that were (preferably Avery himself) undergo a dramatic transformation based on the events that go on. Each individual act--from Red's shooting, to the store burning down, to Av going and attempting to reconcile the violent, selfless act--is done in a highly-believable way, and the character's reactions are so spot-on, it makes you believe you're witnessing an event, not a movie.If I were to point out one thing about this movie, it would be the lack of tension in the final act. Though biased by originally reading the novelization, the final climax in RED leaves little to an already-knowledged viewer's expectations. What appears to play out in a cat-and-mouse styled chase, then a cat-meets-mouse attack is downplayed by lack of true tension. During the point where Av forces Danny into his truck to drive into town, Mr. McCormack almost immediately runs him off the road, only to have Danny smack him in the face as soon as he wakes up (which, though true to the book, is done without tension.) The semi-final scene--in which the big `battle of fate' occurs--isn't as drawn-out and suspenseful as it could have been. A couple shots and everyone is down--big deal, right? Maybe yes, maybe no; regardless, it left me disappointed.In all, I enjoyed RED with a fiery passion. I'd definitely recommend any fan of the original novel to watch it, and would ask people who have previously viewed the movie to recommend it to their friends and family. What little bias I had toward the ending can be easily swept aside to a first-time viewer.Regardless of my expectations, doubts and worries, RED is truly a film to see. Heart-wrenching, gut-churning, and mind-blowing, it's a film anyone who's ever had a great connection to a dog can highly relate to.",4,A man's best friend... until the very end (contains spoilers),1259193600,"11 26, 2009",2009,4369,"['Everyone', 'dog', 'man', 'best', 'friend.For', 'Avery', 'Ludlow', 'nothing', 'can', 'be', 'further', 'truth.For', 'past', 'fourteen', 'years', 'Red', 'been', 'constant', 'companion', 'Waking', 'up', 'same', 'bed', 'trips', 'Av', 'local', 'convenient', 'store', 'down', 'river', 'matter', 'where', 'Avery', 'Red', 'sure', 'follow', 'old', 'companion', 'even', 'older', 'soul.Then', 'one', 'day', 'everything', 'changes.Happening', 'scene', 'pure', 'chance', 'three', 'boys', 'Danny', 'Harold', 'Pete', 'are', 'change', 'Av', 'life', 'nothing', 'bitter', 'aftertaste', 'unexpected', 'visit', 'disturb', 'peace', 'silent', 'moment', 'so', 'when', 'Danny', 'McCormack', 'take', 'things', 'twisted', 'dangerous', 'level', 'things', 'are', 'bound', 'go', 'hand.The', 'boys', 'want', 'three', 'things', 'money', 'valuables', 'Av', 'car.Av', 'one', 'thing', 'peace.When', 'parties', 'get', 'neither', 'innocent', 'creature', 'cruelty', 'man.Shot', 'head', 'close', 'range', 'Browning', 'shotgun', 'Red', 'dead', 'minutes.The', 'boys', 'left', 'nothing.Av', 'will', 'leave', 'something', 'more', 'body', 'dead', 'dog.He', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'revenge', 'mind.Written', 'one', 'twenty-first', 'century', 'masters', 'horror', 'adapted', 'screen', 'man', 'wrote', 'Grudge', 'RED', 'inspiringly-violent', 'film', 'beautiful', 'extravagant', 'emotion', 'Faced', 'all-too-real', 'reality', 'death', 'dog', 'RED', 'will', 'force', 'watch', 'man', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'order', 'get', 'justice', 'dog', 'deserves', 'even', 'taking', 'unconventional', 'ways', 'do', 'it.Quite', 'honestly', 'very', 'little', 'complain', 'film', 'adaptation', 'one', 'Jack', 'Ketchum', 'most', 'amazing', 'novels.', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'Avery', 'Ludlow', 'boys', 'Noel', 'Fisher', 'Kyle', 'Galler', 'Shiloh', 'Fernandez', 'Danny', 'McCormack', 'father', 'Tom', 'Sizemore', 'one', 'most', 'outstanding', 'features', 'movie', 'Even', 'when', 'think', 'children', 'are', ""n't"", 'capable', 'committing', 'such', 'violent', 'atrocious', 'acts', 'Noel', 'Fisher', 'forces', 'believe', 'capable', 'committing', 'one', 'most', 'violent', 'atrocious', 'acts', 'known', 'man', 'little', 'more', 'smirk', 'Obscure', 'vanity', 'overt', 'trust', 'Tom', 'Sizemore', 'behalf', 'see', 'amazing', 'bigotry', 'caused', 'over-idealized', 'expectations', 'father', 'son', 'Kim', 'Dickens', 'who', 'played', 'Carrie', 'news', 'reporter', 'give', 'slightest', 'hope', 'really', 'good', 'there', 'regardless', 'wrong', 'world.', 'fine', 'execution', 'story', 'outstanding', 'brilliant', 'even', 'not', 'characters', 'are', 'fleshed', 'out', 'way', 'should', 'be', 'expected', 'are', 'roles', 'transferred', 'exact', 'way', 'were', 'book', 'were', 'preferably', 'Avery', 'undergo', 'dramatic', 'transformation', 'based', 'events', 'go', 'individual', 'act', 'Red', 'shooting', 'store', 'burning', 'down', 'Av', 'going', 'attempting', 'reconcile', 'violent', 'selfless', 'act', 'done', 'highly-believable', 'way', 'character', 'reactions', 'are', 'so', 'spot-on', 'believe', ""'re"", 'witnessing', 'event', 'not', 'movie.If', 'were', 'point', 'out', 'one', 'thing', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'lack', 'tension', 'final', 'act', 'biased', 'originally', 'reading', 'novelization', 'final', 'climax', 'RED', 'little', 'already-knowledged', 'viewer', 'expectations', 'What', 'play', 'out', 'cat-and-mouse', 'styled', 'chase', 'then', 'cat-meets-mouse', 'attack', 'downplayed', 'lack', 'true', 'tension', 'point', 'where', 'Av', 'Danny', 'truck', 'drive', 'town', 'Mr.', 'McCormack', 'almost', 'immediately', 'off', 'road', 'only', 'have', 'Danny', 'smack', 'face', 'as', 'soon', 'up', 'true', 'book', 'done', 'tension', 'semi-final', 'scene', 'big', 'battle', 'fate', 'occurs', ""n't"", 'drawn-out', 'suspenseful', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'couple', 'shots', 'everyone', 'down', 'big', 'deal', 'right', 'Maybe', 'yes', 'maybe', 'regardless', 'left', 'disappointed.In', 'enjoyed', 'RED', 'fiery', 'passion', ""'d"", 'definitely', 'recommend', 'fan', 'original', 'novel', 'watch', 'would', 'ask', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'previously', 'viewed', 'movie', 'recommend', 'friends', 'family', 'What', 'little', 'bias', 'had', 'ending', 'can', 'be', 'easily', 'swept', 'aside', 'first-time', 'viewer.Regardless', 'expectations', 'doubts', 'worries', 'RED', 'truly', 'film', 'see', 'Heart-wrenching', 'gut-churning', 'mind-blowing', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'had', 'great', 'connection', 'dog', 'can', 'highly', 'relate']",Red

1177564,A2M1N8G4W4END8,B001CT8762,Michael R Gates,"[25, 27]","Though many may argue the point, best-selling author Jack Ketchum (nom de plume of Dallas Mayr) is a writer of frightening horror novels.  However, unlike high-profile genre authors like Stephen King, Peter Straub, Clive Barker, and Dean Koontz, Ketchum only occasionally writes about horrors that arise from fictional supernatural realms.  More often than not, his novels focus on the horrors that arise from within the ranks of the human race, and the ""monsters"" in his novels, which are sometimes inspired by real people and actual events, can be the babysitter next door, privileged kids from a wealthy family, or an ex-girlfriend.  After reading a Ketchum novel, one often comes away feeling as if there's some truth to the old adage that we humans are our own worst enemies.The 2008 indie film RED, based on the Ketchum novel of the same name, tells the story of how Avery Ludlow, a small-town shopkeeper, seeks justice after a trio of rich kids shoot his beloved dog out of spite during an attempted robbery.  Getting nowhere with the police, the boys' parents, or the media, Ludlow takes matters into his own hands and tries to extract a simple apology from the boys.  Being people of privilege, the boys and the wealthy, influential father of two of them react as if they are above the law--which, in effect, they are--and instead of offering an apology, they do things that only compound the transgressions against Ludlow...with ultimately fatal consequences.Although RED was co-directed by Lucky McKee, who is better known for his horror movies, the film treats the subject with much more realism and sensitivity than is found in the average horror fare.  This is partly due to the excellent performances that McKee and his co-director, Trygve Allister Diesen, draw from their experienced cast.  In the role of Ludlow, oft under-appreciated actor Brian Cox--who won accolades for playing audience favorite Dr. Hannibal Lecktor [sic] in Michael Mann's MANHUNTER (1986) long before Anthony Hopkins assumed the role in THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS (1991)--creates a complex, multi-layered character who simply wants his transgressors to understand the depth and repercussions of their senseless act.  Playing Danny, the sociopathic leader of the privileged delinquents, Noel Fisher is truly frightening.  And in supporting roles that cast them against their usual horror-show types, actors Robert Englund (Freddy Krueger in the A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET series) and Amanda Plummer (star of numerous horror and SF movies, among other things) are quite convincing as the incredulous but befuddled parents of one of the boys.Another thing that raises RED above the standard revenge movie is the fact that, at the film's denouement, Avery Ludlow comes to question the ultimate value and morality of his own actions.  Although the boys are clearly wrong in their transgressions against Ludlow and deserve to be punished, and in spite of the fact that Ludlow is undoubtedly entitled to some level of legal recompense, Ludlow nonetheless feels responsible for the fatalities that result from his seeking of justice.  His self-doubt brings into question the nature of justice and whether or not genuine justice indeed exists, and the events of the film that lead Ludlow to his moment of doubt tend to emphasize the widening class and generational schisms in the U.S. and how legal justice is often applied differently based on certain demographics.The DVD edition of RED presents the film in anamorphic widescreen, and the digital transfer is beautiful (which shouldn't be surprising, since the film itself was shot in HD digital video).  The disc is short on extras, offering only a brief but interesting interview with star Brian Cox and a few deleted scenes.

His quiet world gets shattered however after Red is viciously killed for no reason by a troubled rich kid (Noel Fisher) whose father (Tom Sizemore) refuses to let Avery get any sort of justice.  It isn't long before Avery seeks to take justice in his own hands, and things begin to spiral out of control.  Co-directed by Trygve Allister Diesen and rising horror great Lucky McKee, Red is simple in its storytelling of a damaged man that isn't out for revenge, but just wants the justice that he deserves.  Were it not for the wonderful performance of Cox, the character more than likely wouldn't work out as well as it does here.  And while the film does to fall apart a little as it winds down, Red still manages to leave the viewer with quite an impact, and is riveting throughout as well.

This is just one of the questions posed to the viewer in the film, the most recent adaptation of a Jack Ketchum novel.Red takes all your preconceived notions of what a revenge film is, which, for some reason, is what this film is being marketed as.  It's not really a revenge film at all; when I think vigilante revenge I think of Death Wish or even Thriller: A Cruel Picture, but not this film.  This is a character study of how one simple, plain man reacts to a gruesome scenario; almost a noir in the sense that an every day man is placed into the absurdity of violence and malevolence.It is a film about choices, those we do and do not make, and the consequences they bring about.  When Ludlow is told by his friend in the police force that no one wants to help him, the DA won't prosecute, the local news refuses to cover the story any further after an initial airing of a brief interview with Ludlow, he doesn't necessarily take the law into his hands per say, he simply does a little bit further than most people would as they let the cops take care of everything.  So, the idea of law and those who supposedly uphold it, the police & court systems, is questioned with a subtlety that might be missed in the light of preconceived ideas that this is a shoot 'em up, older man snaps film in the vein of Falling Down.  This is not, I say again, that type of a film; it is a study of human beings and the terrible things we're capable of, and how most try to make sense of the senseless, in this case it's simply Ludlow's quest for an apology from the young boy who so happily murdered his dog and the things he does to get it.  Unfortunately, once Ludlow gets it, it's too late and there's no real going back after all has been said and done.Brian Cox, as always, does a spectacular job with his role, I'm thoroughly convinced that the man can not hand in a bad performance. (not that he hasn't made some questionable choices with the films he chooses to be in, i.e. The Ringer)  Tom Sizemore actually manages to lift himself from his real life booze and drug addicted haze to hand in a convincing performance as a father who simply does not care, who feels that every problem can either be punched (as is made clear by the bruises on his wife's face.) or bought off.  All else included do their best with their roles as well, not a bad performance to be found here.",5,"""You don't always need to see the truth to know it.""

They try to rob him, but he has nothing of value, so, in annoyance, a teen named Danny shoots Red. Avery finds out who the shooter is (from the local gunshop owner) and goes to meet the boy&#8217;s father. All he wants is for Danny to acknowledge what he did and to express remorse. Instead, Danny smugly denies everything and his father &#8211; a completely amoral wheeler-dealer who surely believes Avery but doesn&#8217;t care so long as he can&#8217;t prove it &#8211; throws Avery out.

1177572,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B001CT8762,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 1]","Red (Lucky McKee and Trygve Allister Diesen, 2008)Jack Ketchum's novels have received an unprecedented amount of attention from Hollywood recently; three of them (The Girl Next Door, The Lost, and Red) have gotten big-budget film treatments in the last couple of years, and three more (Offspring, its sequel Off Season, and the tremendously disgusting Right to Life--I can't wait to see how they avoid an NC-17 with that one) are in the offing. Leave it to May director Lucky McKee to make the most powerful of the batch one of Ketchum's rare non-horror outings. McKee (and Isle of Darkness director Trygve Allister Diesen, who took over after McKee and the production company parted ways) took a novel which combines revenge thriller and high drama and managed to make a film that does exactly the same thing. I wasn't expecting that, and I was thrilled with the result.Red is the story of a boy and his dog. Well, an old man, Avery Ludlow (Brian Cox, recently of Zodiac) and his dog Red. The two of them are just going along, living their lives, until a trio of spoiled rich kids from down the city, Danny (The Riches' Noel Fisher), Harold (Jennifer's Body's Kyle Gallner), and Pete (Deadgirl's Shiloh Fernandez), run across him. After a failed (and somewhat incompetent) attempt at a robbery, Danny shoots Red. The rest of the film is about Avery attempting to get justice from the boys, and from Danny and Pete's father (Splinter's Tom Sizemore). As he finds himself stonewalled at every turn, Avery escalates his attempts to get justice, but not at all in the way you'd expect from a Jack Ketchum protagonist; this is far less King of the Ants than it is Class Action, and I think part of the power of the film, for those of us who are aware of Ketchum's body of work, comes from waiting for that shoe to drop. There's a surprising amount of tension in just waiting for Avery to snap, and expecting a bloodbath when it happens. But what we get is a surprisingly restrained Avery, and it works on every level.Of course, a movie like this would not work without a sterling performance by the actor in Avery's role, and Cox turns in the best I've seen from him since at least Braveheart, and maybe going all the way back to Manhunter. Sizemore, who has in recent years shown quite the tendency to overact (think Ring Around the Rosie or Paparazzi here), tones it down a little and also comes up with one of the better performances he's turned in in the past decade. Fernandez shows that Deadgirl wasn't a fluke. And the supporting cast, made up mostly of folks you know but can't quite remember where from (Hellraiser's Ashley Laurence turns up as Sizemore's trophy wife, The Gift's Kim Dickens plays an idealistic reporter, TV-movie fixture Martha Bennett plays Avery's best friend, etc.), all turn in performances that make me wonder why Hollywood isn't busting down their doors and eating all the chickens.If the movie has a problem, it's in the pacing, which seems a little jerky at times. Movies like this, which generally feature long, slow scenes punctuated by moments of violence, can be kind of hard to pull off. The best directors seem to do it effortlessly (there is no greater example than Bela Tarr's Satantango, in which one scene of shocking, immense violence occurs roughly halfway through the seven-and-a-half hour film, and it is masterfully done), but McKee has had problems with this sort of thing before (the pacing was the main flaw in The Woods as well). Still, I'm willing to cut him and Diesen a great deal of slack on that because the rest of this picture is so close to flawless. Given that the film was almost completely direct to video (it was released on only two screens, and given that it made a grand total of $3,500 on the big screen, I'm guessing that was a single showing), you almost certainly missed it the first time around. You can correct that mistake now that it's out on video, and I strongly suggest doing so at your earliest convenience. A fantastic little film that should have gotten far wider exposure than it did. ****",4,Stunning.,1260403200,"12 10, 2009",2009,4069,"['Red', 'Lucky', 'McKee', 'Trygve', 'Allister', 'Diesen', '2008', 'Jack', 'Ketchum', 'novels', 'have', 'received', 'unprecedented', 'amount', 'attention', 'Hollywood', 'recently', 'three', 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'Lost', 'Red', 'have', 'gotten', 'big-budget', 'film', 'treatments', 'last', 'couple', 'years', 'three', 'more', 'Offspring', 'sequel', 'Off', 'Season', 'tremendously', 'disgusting', 'Right', 'Life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'how', 'avoid', 'NC-17', 'one', 'are', 'offing', 'Leave', 'May', 'director', 'Lucky', 'McKee', 'make', 'most', 'powerful', 'batch', 'one', 'Ketchum', 'rare', 'non-horror', 'outings', 'McKee', 'Isle', 'Darkness', 'director', 'Trygve', 'Allister', 'Diesen', 'who', 'took', 'over', 'McKee', 'production', 'company', 'parted', 'ways', 'took', 'novel', 'revenge', 'thriller', 'high', 'drama', 'managed', 'make', 'film', 'exactly', 'same', 'thing', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'was', 'thrilled', 'result.Red', 'story', 'boy', 'dog', 'Well', 'old', 'man', 'Avery', 'Ludlow', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'recently', 'Zodiac', 'dog', 'Red', 'two', 'are', 'just', 'going', 'along', 'living', 'lives', 'trio', 'spoiled', 'rich', 'kids', 'city', 'Danny', 'Riches', 'Noel', 'Fisher', 'Harold', 'Jennifer', 'Body', 'Kyle', 'Gallner', 'Pete', 'Deadgirl', 'Shiloh', 'Fernandez', 'run', 'failed', 'somewhat', 'incompetent', 'attempt', 'robbery', 'Danny', 'shoots', 'Red', 'rest', 'film', 'Avery', 'attempting', 'get', 'justice', 'boys', 'Danny', 'Pete', 'father', 'Splinter', 'Tom', 'Sizemore', 'stonewalled', 'turn', 'Avery', 'attempts', 'get', 'justice', 'not', 'way', ""'d"", 'expect', 'Jack', 'Ketchum', 'protagonist', 'far', 'less', 'King', 'Ants', 'Class', 'Action', 'think', 'part', 'power', 'film', 'who', 'are', 'aware', 'Ketchum', 'body', 'work', 'waiting', 'shoe', 'drop', 'surprising', 'amount', 'tension', 'just', 'waiting', 'Avery', 'snap', 'expecting', 'bloodbath', 'when', 'what', 'get', 'surprisingly', 'restrained', 'Avery', 'level.Of', 'course', 'movie', 'would', 'not', 'work', 'sterling', 'performance', 'actor', 'Avery', 'role', 'Cox', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'least', 'Braveheart', 'maybe', 'going', 'way', 'back', 'Manhunter', 'Sizemore', 'who', 'recent', 'years', 'shown', 'quite', 'tendency', 'overact', 'think', 'Ring', 'Rosie', 'Paparazzi', 'here', 'down', 'little', 'also', 'up', 'one', 'better', 'performances', 'turned', 'past', 'decade', 'Fernandez', 'Deadgirl', 'was', ""n't"", 'fluke', 'supporting', 'cast', 'made', 'up', 'mostly', 'folks', 'know', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'remember', 'where', 'Hellraiser', 'Ashley', 'Laurence', 'up', 'Sizemore', 'trophy', 'wife', 'Gift', 'Kim', 'Dickens', 'idealistic', 'reporter', 'TV-movie', 'fixture', 'Martha', 'Bennett', 'Avery', 'best', 'friend', 'etc', 'turn', 'performances', 'make', 'wonder', 'why', 'Hollywood', ""n't"", 'busting', 'down', 'doors', 'eating', 'chickens.If', 'movie', 'problem', 'pacing', 'little', 'jerky', 'times', 'Movies', 'generally', 'feature', 'long', 'slow', 'scenes', 'punctuated', 'moments', 'violence', 'can', 'be', 'kind', 'hard', 'pull', 'off', 'best', 'directors', 'seem', 'do', 'effortlessly', 'greater', 'example', 'Bela', 'Tarr', 'Satantango', 'one', 'scene', 'shocking', 'immense', 'violence', 'roughly', 'halfway', 'seven-and-a-half', 'hour', 'film', 'masterfully', 'done', 'McKee', 'had', 'problems', 'sort', 'thing', 'pacing', 'was', 'main', 'flaw', 'Woods', 'as', 'well', 'Still', ""'m"", 'willing', 'cut', 'Diesen', 'great', 'deal', 'slack', 'rest', 'picture', 'so', 'close', 'flawless', 'Given', 'film', 'was', 'almost', 'completely', 'direct', 'video', 'was', 'released', 'only', 'two', 'screens', 'given', 'made', 'grand', 'total', '3,500', 'big', 'screen', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'was', 'single', 'showing', 'almost', 'certainly', 'missed', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'can', 'correct', 'mistake', 'now', 'out', 'video', 'strongly', 'suggest', 'doing', 'so', 'earliest', 'convenience', 'A', 'fantastic', 'little', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'far', 'wider', 'exposure', 'did', '****']",Red

Brian Cox's character displays remarkable restraint as the man out to get some justice, or just a simple apology from the youths who kill his beloved ""Red."" Sometimes it almost seems as if Cox is too quiet and controlled. We in the audience are geared to seeing more violent retaliation. But that's not what this movie is about. This is less of a bam-wham-pow story and more of an adult exploration of how to deal with the heedless, sometimes deranged cruelty of others.There are some clich&eacute;s and some unlikelihoods here. For example, it's odd that the police consider the crime committed against Cox's character too negligible to pursue vigorously. This is especially true since the offending youths not only killed Red, but held a rifle to Cox's head in the process. But of course this police indifference allows the film to be more romantically about a lone man's pursuit of justice. Then Cox's back-story - the history that has numbed, defeated, and determined him all at once - is a bit over the top. Also, it's once again the rich who are portrayed as being sinisterly, superciliously evil.But all-in-all this is a brilliantly acted, engrossing film about some real people who exist in the real world, beyond any cartoon battles between good and evil.",4,"Absorbing, Low-Key Drama",1231632000,"01 11, 2009",2009,1397,"[""'re"", 'looking', 'Death', 'Wish-style', 'revenge', 'man', 'dog', 'killed', 'punks', 'here', ""'ve"", 'got', 'wrong', 'movie', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'character', 'displays', 'remarkable', 'restraint', 'man', 'out', 'get', 'justice', 'just', 'simple', 'apology', 'youths', 'who', 'kill', 'beloved', 'Red', 'almost', 'Cox', 'too', 'quiet', 'controlled', 'audience', 'are', 'geared', 'seeing', 'more', 'violent', 'retaliation', 'not', 'what', 'movie', 'about', 'less', 'bam-wham-pow', 'story', 'more', 'adult', 'exploration', 'how', 'deal', 'heedless', 'sometimes', 'deranged', 'cruelty', 'are', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'unlikelihoods', 'here', 'example', 'odd', 'police', 'consider', 'crime', 'committed', 'Cox', 'character', 'too', 'negligible', 'pursue', 'vigorously', 'especially', 'true', 'offending', 'youths', 'not', 'only', 'killed', 'Red', 'held', 'rifle', 'Cox', 'head', 'process', 'course', 'police', 'indifference', 'film', 'be', 'more', 'romantically', 'lone', 'man', 'pursuit', 'justice', 'Then', 'Cox', 'back-story', 'history', 'numbed', 'defeated', 'determined', 'once', 'bit', 'top', 'Also', 'once', 'again', 'rich', 'who', 'are', 'portrayed', 'being', 'sinisterly', 'superciliously', 'evil.But', 'all-in-all', 'brilliantly', 'acted', 'engrossing', 'film', 'real', 'people', 'who', 'exist', 'real', 'world', 'cartoon', 'battles', 'good', 'evil']",Red

What really sold me was Brian Cox, who I thought did a wonderful job.  I've always liked him, and this showed he can really carry a movie himself.  In fact, watching this I was reminded of an idea I had years ago(though admittedly not an original one) of an awards show that would give film awards to those films the Academy pays no attention to come Oscar time.Anyway, I'm not gonna rehash the plot here, but I'll say that this movie stuck to the book very well, and it really had no reason not to as the book was rather straightforward.  One of Ketchum's tamer books actually.  But tamer certainly doesn't mean wimpy or uninteresting, mind you!This is a movie that pisses you off, and by that I mean that you're so on Avery's side that you can feel his frustration and you almost clench your fists in anger at the fact that nothing seems to be done about Avery's situation.  And lets not forget Sizemore and his son, who are weaselly jagoffs who know they've done wrong but simply do not care.You're hoping that Avery goes into full on Bronson mode and makes mincemeat out of everyone who stands in his path to justice, but this isn't a vigilante action film.  Though a situation like the one in this movie can only seemingly end in violence, it's kept on a more realistic level, and that packs more of an emotional punch.  After all this is more or less a drama.Very good movie, and I'm glad I watched it.

I gave it a shot, because it based on a book by Jack Ketchum, the writer who has given us the novels and eventually the films, The Lost, Offspring, The Girl Next Door, & The Women. I really enjoy Ketchum's style, I gave this movie a shot, and it really surprised me. The story is a simple one about a simple man, Avery Ludlow (Brian Cox), who is out fishing with his old dog Red. Quickly the serenity is destroyed by three rich kids looking to have some fun. In the process of robbing Ludlow, one of the boys shoots and kills Red. As it would turn out, there's a lot more to Avery Ludlow than meets the eye and there is a wild story about Red, where he came from, and what he means to Ludlow, who spends the rest of the film trying to get justice for his pet, from a town that really doesn't care a whole lot. Brian Cox is the star and lets face it, he's been in everything, and by this point we've all seen him in something and know how great he is. Out of all of Cox's roles though, this is one that really stood out to me, because he is beyond terrific and a perfect fit for the character of Avery Ludlow. Cox is paired with a few up and coming teen stars and their rich father played by Tom Sizemore. Together, they are the complete opposite of Ludlow, both in status and in personality, bringing the film full circle.

The tension builds slowly, as the gravity of the situation increases, and emotions become more heated.  When the lid finally blows, the story travels down a violent and overdramatic path.Avery Ludlow (Brian Cox) is fishing at a lake in Oregon, with his dog Red at his side, when three teens come by and attempt to rob him.  Upset that Ludlow has no money, Danny McCormack (Noel Fisher) kills the dog with a shotgun, while his brother Harold (Kyle Gallner) and friend Pete (Shiloh Fernandez) look on.After burying his beloved pet, a gift from his late wife, Ludlow tracks Danny down and speaks to his father Michael McCormick (Tom Sizemore), a businessman with great influence.  When confronted, the boys deny being involved.  Ludlow attempts to work within the system, speaking to his lawyer, law enforcement, and the parents of the third boy, but the authorities refuse to prosecute.  Ludlow's cause is taken up by Carrie Donald (Kim Dickens), a TV news reporter who does a story about the incident, which appears on the local news.A rock thrown through a window at Ludlow's home, begins an escalation in hostility and violence, that reaches extreme lengths in the final act of the film.  A horrific tragedy in Ludlow's past, is part of the reason why he refuses to give up his quest for justice, and continues to focus his attentions on the McCormick's.The movie sets the stage nicely, as Ludlow's behavior is very reasonable and restrained, until he is pushed too far, and then loses touch with reality.  After this, all bets are off, as Ludlow and the McCormick's, finally settle their differences.The radical ending doesn't quite fit with came before, but the acting performances by almost everyone are pretty good, and help to sell the story.  Brian Cox brings conviction to his role, but is put to the test when he details the grim circumstances surrounding the death of his wife, and also later when he acts like a man possessed.  Tom Sizemore is also pretty good as the ruthless McCormick.Rating 3.5 stars, and recommended to Prime members, Red is probably not an uplifting experience, particularly for dog owners, but if you can handle an innocent pet being gunned down, this is a thought provoking film where things don't quite go as expected.",3,a slow burn that goes from reasonable to radical...,1347753600,"09 16, 2012",2012,2381,"['man', 'tragic', 'loss', 'quest', 'justice', 'Red', '2008', 'film', 'based', 'novel', 'Jack', 'Ketchum', 'tension', 'slowly', 'gravity', 'situation', 'become', 'more', 'heated', 'When', 'lid', 'finally', 'story', 'down', 'violent', 'overdramatic', 'path.Avery', 'Ludlow', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'fishing', 'lake', 'Oregon', 'dog', 'Red', 'side', 'when', 'three', 'teens', 'come', 'attempt', 'rob', 'Upset', 'Ludlow', 'money', 'Danny', 'McCormack', 'Noel', 'Fisher', 'dog', 'shotgun', 'brother', 'Harold', 'Kyle', 'Gallner', 'friend', 'Pete', 'Shiloh', 'Fernandez', 'look', 'on.After', 'burying', 'beloved', 'pet', 'gift', 'late', 'wife', 'Ludlow', 'Danny', 'down', 'speaks', 'father', 'Michael', 'McCormick', 'Tom', 'Sizemore', 'businessman', 'great', 'influence', 'When', 'confronted', 'boys', 'deny', 'being', 'involved', 'Ludlow', 'attempts', 'work', 'system', 'speaking', 'lawyer', 'law', 'enforcement', 'parents', 'third', 'boy', 'authorities', 'refuse', 'prosecute', 'Ludlow', 'cause', 'taken', 'up', 'Carrie', 'Donald', 'Kim', 'Dickens', 'TV', 'news', 'reporter', 'who', 'story', 'incident', 'local', 'news.A', 'rock', 'thrown', 'window', 'Ludlow', 'home', 'escalation', 'hostility', 'violence', 'extreme', 'lengths', 'final', 'act', 'film', 'horrific', 'tragedy', 'Ludlow', 'past', 'part', 'reason', 'why', 'give', 'up', 'quest', 'justice', 'focus', 'attentions', ""McCormick's.The"", 'movie', 'stage', 'nicely', 'Ludlow', 'behavior', 'very', 'reasonable', 'restrained', 'pushed', 'too', 'far', 'then', 'touch', 'reality', 'bets', 'are', 'off', 'Ludlow', 'McCormick', 'finally', 'settle', 'differences.The', 'radical', 'ending', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fit', 'came', 'acting', 'performances', 'almost', 'everyone', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'help', 'sell', 'story', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'conviction', 'role', 'put', 'test', 'when', 'details', 'grim', 'circumstances', 'surrounding', 'death', 'wife', 'also', 'later', 'when', 'man', 'possessed', 'Tom', 'Sizemore', 'also', 'pretty', 'good', 'ruthless', 'McCormick.Rating', '3.5', 'stars', 'recommended', 'Prime', 'members', 'Red', 'probably', 'not', 'uplifting', 'experience', 'particularly', 'dog', 'owners', 'can', 'handle', 'innocent', 'pet', 'being', 'gunned', 'down', 'thought', 'provoking', 'film', 'where', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'go', 'expected']",Red
