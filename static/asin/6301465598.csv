Instead I'm just basically commenting on it here to whine and cry that it was NOT released on widescreen. What a ripoff!Yes, I'm thankful that Shelley's other films like Caveman and The Money Pit DID get released in wonderful widescreen around the same time, and Outrageous Fortune is due out as a widescreener on May 6 - but why then was Troop Beverly Hills relegated to putrid pan-and-scan?And where do most of these hunks of junk soon end up? That's right - the giveaway bin for duds - your generic $5.99 ""special"" at your local Boxmart store. You know, where you find all the other weak standard screen butcherings of everything from Doc Hollywood to Spies Like Us.I think Shelley deserves much better than this, and the same goes for her performance in Losin' It, which became another travesty of DVD justice that wound up on the pan-and-scan cutting room floor. (Thankfully her excellent tawdry turn in Night Shift also survived on widescreen, at least.)I'll quote another reviewer named Mike from this same website, who I don't know but am in complete agreement with:""...4 Stars for the DVD - and that's only because it's finally been released on DVD. It has nothing to do with it being a bare bones release (no special features for this 80s CLASSIC!), but rather it's ONLY been released in Full Screen! WHY!?""Yes - WHY indeed? It costs virtually nothing more to leave it in its original widescreen format, and if anything it's a lot more trouble and money to blow up and crop off almost half the picture of every scene of a film! Mike continues:""DVDs are more or less for collectors, and true collectors definitely prefer widescreen! I do anyway, and I'm kinda sad there is no widescreen presentation.""You said it all, Mike! But I was more than sad. I was devastated!So I advise all Shelley Long fans to rush out and buy Caveman, The Money Pit, Night Shift and Outrageous Fortune.

Phyllis Nefler (played by ""Cheers"" star Shelley Long) leads this group of spoiled Beverly Hills princesses.Along their journey, they learn how to be ""real wilderness girls"" in a non conventional way while fighting the evils of Vesta Plendor (played by the very funny Betty Thomas.) Vesta will stop at nothing to prove Phyllis and her troop are nothing more than a group of pampered Beverly Hills brats.Audra Lindley (Mrs. Roper from ""Three's Company"") also has a small part in this movie as Francis Temple, the good-natured wilderness girl official. Ironically, Tori Spelling (of 90210 fame) also has a small part belittling the girls from Beverly Hills!If you're looking for classic 80's movies that are slightly off the beaten path, that everyone will love, I also recommend:Three for the Road,Who's That Girl?,Splash,The Wizard,She-Devil,Just One of the Guys,Steel Magnolias&Quick Change.This is a great movie for kids or teenagers because it has a positive message.

253865,A4UGMKUSX9XHI,6301465598,Robert Stone,"[4, 5]","I purchased Troop Beverly Hills after my wife, who is a Girl Scout leader, noted having fond memories of this film growing up. I was quite skeptical, to be honest, but was pleasantly surprised. You see, I am NOT a Shelley Long fan. Shelley's performance was actually appropriate (only as over-the-top as the character required) and the film was mostly cute family fare (with one exception - see next paragraph). The movie follows Shelley Long's character's quest to become a better parent by becoming a leader of what are clearly Girl Scouts in all but name. She does this in order to re-connect with her estranged husband who during the film is in the process of divorcing her. She comes up against a drill-sargent type zealot whom she must defeat in several ways. The plot is predictable and the outcome never in doubt - but that ends up being part of the fun.LANGUAGE WARNING - I was surprised with the PG rating (as opposed to PG-13) to hear the ""S"" word probably a dozen or more times during the movie, along with with a smaller number of ""B"" words which rhyme with witch. There are also some references to someone ""boffing"" another and at one point a young character suggests to her romance-writing mother that she use the phrase ""swelling manhood"" which her mother modifies to ""swelling pulsating manhood."" To be honest, these moments really feel out of place in this movie and could have easily been left out without any impact on it. In fact, the rest of the movie is much more tame than those enjoyed by teens (even back in the day when I was a teen in the 80s) and the foul language does not change that overall feel. I suspect the producers included it intentionally to avoid the dreaded ""G"" rating which would have reduced the audience considerably when it was released. You might want to keep all this in mind for younger viewers. We ""had some 'splainin to do"" to our kids as we watched. Come to think of it, PG-13 might not have been invented at the time when this movie was rated. In any case, be forewarned.Please don't interpret my 3 star rating as a negative - I took off one star for language and another since this isn't, after all, Citizen Kane or Gone With the Wind - but then again my kids would never sit through either of those pictures at this age (they are 6 and 8).

I was a girl scout as a child and at that time, an adult volunteer so I could totally identify with some of the stuff I saw in it with the so-called ""wilderness girls."" I saw leaders just like Velda Plendor...scaree. It would've been more fun with leaders like Phyllils Neffler, for sure! It's funny that only this year I realized that the year that TBH came out was the same year I got divorced and was involved in Girl Scouts... so perhaps that's another reason I liked it and identify with it despite not being a pre-adolescent. I look back and remember my own personal journey through growing through divorce, and can laugh at the the movie as I watch Phyllis make the transition from giving up a limited identity as a ""Beverly Hills wife""...and growing into a more multi-facet person. At any rate, I enjoyed TBH because of Phyllis's never ending enthusiasm and ability to take a lemon and make it into lemonade! Sure it's lighthearted fare geared toward pre-adolescents, but there's still plenty of valuable lessons in it. Like how Phyllis Neffler comes up with that impromptu birthday party for the cynical girl, and also pays the dues for the daughter of the washed up teen idol...and how she gives all the girls a sense of better self esteem... and something like that is always good to watch.

Shelley Long plays Phyllis Neffler, a rich Beverly Hills woman undergoing a divorce from the husband she still loves. At the same time, she joins her daughter's Wildnerness Girls troop as the leader to get more involved in her daughter's life. Little does Phyllis realize that not only will she become a wonderful role model to them, but they all help her get through her problems as well. Phyllis is up against a tyrant of a captain for the Wilderness Girls who is hellbent on stopping Troop Beverly Hills from being a part of the Wilderness Girls for good. But Phyllis finds the niche for these girls to fit into. The whole thing is good, silly late 80's fun. Shelley Long is hilarious. Plus, look for Tori Spelling as one of the Red Feathers.
