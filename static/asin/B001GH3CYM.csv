1196721,ART1AV2469IJP,B001GH3CYM,Brad,"[0, 0]",I had seen Thou Shalt Laugh 3 before I bought it. I will be honest and say that I only bought it because I love Leanne Morgan. I did not find the other comedians funny but it was worth it to me to buy it to watch Leanne Morgan and to share her act with family and friends.,3,Laughter is a good thing,1363651200,"03 19, 2013",2013,272,"['had', 'seen', 'Thou', 'Shalt', 'Laugh', '3', 'bought', 'will', 'be', 'honest', 'say', 'only', 'bought', 'love', 'Leanne', 'Morgan', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'other', 'comedians', 'funny', 'was', 'worth', 'buy', 'watch', 'Leanne', 'Morgan', 'share', 'act', 'family', 'friends']",Thou Shalt Laugh 3 Hosted By Sinbad
1196722,A3OXHLG6DIBRW8,B001GH3CYM,"C. Hill ""CFH""","[2, 2]","We stumbled across the ""Thou Shalt Laugh"" DVDs last year and were pleasantly surprised at how funny the comedians (for the most part) were in the first two DVDs. While still containing some very funny bits, this third one misses the family friendly mark by a good bit, especially if you have small kids. We try to limit our (and our kids) exposure to the generally crude and profanity laden stand up comedy that is played on radio and TV, but even on ""family friendly"" satellite radio comedy channels some inappropriate content slips through, but we didn't expect that here.This is the first DVD of four, as of this writing, and sadly there is just too much questionable material on this DVD to recommend it for all audiences.CFH",2,Funny but Not Fully Family Friendly,1264636800,"01 28, 2010",2010,729,"['stumbled', 'Thou', 'Shalt', 'Laugh', 'DVDs', 'last', 'year', 'were', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'how', 'funny', 'comedians', 'most', 'part', 'were', 'first', 'two', 'DVDs', 'still', 'containing', 'very', 'funny', 'bits', 'third', 'one', 'family', 'friendly', 'mark', 'good', 'bit', 'especially', 'have', 'small', 'kids', 'try', 'limit', 'kids', 'exposure', 'generally', 'crude', 'profanity', 'laden', 'stand', 'up', 'comedy', 'played', 'radio', 'TV', 'even', 'family', 'friendly', 'satellite', 'radio', 'comedy', 'channels', 'inappropriate', 'content', 'slips', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'here.This', 'first', 'DVD', 'four', 'writing', 'sadly', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'questionable', 'material', 'DVD', 'recommend', 'audiences.CFH']",Thou Shalt Laugh 3 Hosted By Sinbad

1196725,AH2NG0HB9DX6S,B001GH3CYM,Ladfam,"[2, 3]","Thou Shalt Laugh 3 is another very funny installment in this series.Common to all three in the TSL series are the comedians Thor Ramsey and Taylor Mason, both of whom are extremely funny throughout.The funniest bits are the stories that resonate with us due to their truth, generally because we're familiar with such experiences.  Thor's commentary on modern-day customer service is a perfect example here!  Hilarious stuff!Taylor brings his trademark humor to TSL3 but really showcases his impressive talent as a ventriloquist with the singing portions.  The audience interaction portion of his show, as with his appearances elsewhere, is the icing on the cake.Newcomers Horace H.B. Sanders, Lisa Alvarado, and Leanne Morgan all bring their unique comic style to TSL3, and all three are very funny in their own way.  Leanne Morgan, in particular, had us laughing throughout her routine - mostly because we are from the south and we ""get"" what she is talking about.We were pleasantly surprised by Sinbad, the host of TSL3.  The way in which he handled audience questions - questions which we would expect to elicit deep, profound responses - with deadpan simple answers, was hilarious.As other reviews point out, Thou Shalt Laugh 3 does contain a heavier dose of sexual humor.  Although most of it should fly over the radar of younger kids, if there is any concern in this regard, perhaps they should just watch Taylor's performance at the end.",5,Still funny,1234569600,"02 14, 2009",2009,1444,"['Thou', 'Shalt', 'Laugh', '3', 'very', 'funny', 'installment', 'series.Common', 'three', 'TSL', 'series', 'are', 'comedians', 'Thor', 'Ramsey', 'Taylor', 'Mason', 'whom', 'are', 'extremely', 'funny', 'throughout.The', 'funniest', 'bits', 'are', 'stories', 'resonate', 'due', 'truth', 'generally', ""'re"", 'familiar', 'such', 'experiences', 'Thor', 'commentary', 'modern-day', 'customer', 'service', 'perfect', 'example', 'here', 'Hilarious', 'stuff', 'Taylor', 'trademark', 'humor', 'TSL3', 'really', 'impressive', 'talent', 'ventriloquist', 'singing', 'portions', 'audience', 'interaction', 'portion', 'show', 'appearances', 'elsewhere', 'icing', 'cake.Newcomers', 'Horace', 'H.B', 'Sanders', 'Lisa', 'Alvarado', 'Leanne', 'Morgan', 'bring', 'unique', 'comic', 'style', 'TSL3', 'three', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'own', 'way', 'Leanne', 'Morgan', 'particular', 'had', 'laughing', 'routine', 'mostly', 'are', 'south', 'get', 'what', 'talking', 'about.We', 'were', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'Sinbad', 'host', 'TSL3', 'way', 'handled', 'audience', 'questions', 'questions', 'would', 'expect', 'elicit', 'deep', 'profound', 'responses', 'deadpan', 'simple', 'answers', 'was', 'hilarious.As', 'other', 'reviews', 'point', 'out', 'Thou', 'Shalt', 'Laugh', '3', 'contain', 'heavier', 'dose', 'sexual', 'humor', 'most', 'should', 'fly', 'radar', 'younger', 'kids', 'concern', 'regard', 'perhaps', 'should', 'just', 'watch', 'Taylor', 'performance', 'end']",Thou Shalt Laugh 3 Hosted By Sinbad
