Some people say I have a sex addiction, but I think all those years of prostitution was just a means to feed my ravenous hunger for heroin. It's kinda like the chicken or the nugget. The point is, I'm addicted to gambling. Thank you""....Amy Sedaris' wickedly irreverent Comedy Central TV series, STRANGERS WITH CANDY, comes to the screen with a satisfying movie spin-off that will please newcomers as well as those already well-versed in the world of Jerri Blank.Meet Jerri Blank (Amy Sedaris).  She's your typical 47-year-old former drug-addicted lesbian prostitute, who decides to turn her life around when she's released from prison.  Upon arriving home to discover her beloved father in a coma--brought on by his daughter's shameful lifestyle as she's continually reminded--Jerri decides to resume her life exactly as she left it - right back in highschool.  Convinced that winning the science award will awaken her father, Jerri strives to prove to the world - and herself - that even a drug-addled ex-con with lesbian tendencies can make their mark!The original TV series, fashioned as a parody on the old-style After School specials, was a cult sensation for Comedy Central and ran for several seasons.  When the time came for a movie, Sedaris and co-writers Stephen Colbert and Paul Dinello decided to go right back to the beginning of Jerri's story, so that audiences who had never seen the show could enjoy it as much as the hardcore fans.  It was a smart move which paid off.  STRANGERS WITH CANDY is a complete romp right from the start, capped off by Amy Sedaris' glorious creation that is Jerri Blank.  Sedaris gives Jerri a soul, humanity, but also a great deal of comic irrevrence.  She's a 100% fleshed out character.Matthew Broderick and Sarah Jessica Parker have clever cameo roles; Deborah Rush is Jerri's icy stepmother, and Ian Holm has a small role as the family doctor.  Reprising their roles from the TV series are Stephen Colbert (""The Daily Show"", ""The Colbert Report"") as Chuck Noblet, the God-fearing, married science teacher trying to shake off the lustful desires he harbours for art teacher Geoffrey Jellineck (Paul Dinello).The budget-priced DVD comes stacked with extras including feature commentary with Sedaris, Colbert and Dinello, deleted scenes, theatrical trailer, and the music video for ""Atomic Car"".",4,"hilarious, anarchic comedy gem",1252540800,"09 10, 2009",2009,2460,"['Hello', ""'m"", 'Jerri', 'Blank', ""'m"", 'alcoholic', ""'m"", 'also', 'addicted', 'amphetamines', 'as', 'well', 'main', 'line', 'narcotics', 'people', 'say', 'have', 'sex', 'addiction', 'think', 'years', 'prostitution', 'was', 'just', 'means', 'feed', 'ravenous', 'hunger', 'heroin', 'kinda', 'chicken', 'nugget', 'point', ""'m"", 'addicted', 'gambling', 'Thank', 'Sedaris', 'wickedly', 'irreverent', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'TV', 'series', 'STRANGERS', 'WITH', 'CANDY', 'screen', 'satisfying', 'movie', 'spin-off', 'will', 'please', 'newcomers', 'as', 'well', 'already', 'well-versed', 'world', 'Jerri', 'Blank.Meet', 'Jerri', 'Blank', 'Amy', 'Sedaris', 'typical', '47-year-old', 'former', 'drug-addicted', 'lesbian', 'prostitute', 'who', 'turn', 'life', 'when', 'released', 'prison', 'arriving', 'home', 'discover', 'beloved', 'father', 'coma', 'brought', 'daughter', 'shameful', 'lifestyle', 'continually', 'reminded', 'Jerri', 'resume', 'life', 'exactly', 'left', 'right', 'back', 'highschool', 'Convinced', 'winning', 'science', 'award', 'will', 'awaken', 'father', 'Jerri', 'prove', 'world', 'even', 'drug-addled', 'ex-con', 'lesbian', 'tendencies', 'can', 'make', 'mark', 'original', 'TV', 'series', 'fashioned', 'parody', 'old-style', 'School', 'specials', 'was', 'cult', 'sensation', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'ran', 'several', 'seasons', 'When', 'time', 'came', 'movie', 'Sedaris', 'co-writers', 'Stephen', 'Colbert', 'Paul', 'Dinello', 'decided', 'go', 'right', 'back', 'beginning', 'Jerri', 'story', 'audiences', 'who', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'show', 'could', 'enjoy', 'as', 'much', 'hardcore', 'fans', 'was', 'smart', 'move', 'paid', 'off', 'STRANGERS', 'WITH', 'CANDY', 'complete', 'romp', 'right', 'start', 'capped', 'off', 'Amy', 'Sedaris', 'glorious', 'creation', 'Jerri', 'Blank', 'Sedaris', 'Jerri', 'soul', 'humanity', 'also', 'great', 'deal', 'comic', 'irrevrence', '100', '%', 'fleshed', 'out', 'character.Matthew', 'Broderick', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'have', 'clever', 'cameo', 'roles', 'Deborah', 'Rush', 'Jerri', 'icy', 'stepmother', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'small', 'role', 'family', 'doctor', 'Reprising', 'roles', 'TV', 'series', 'are', 'Stephen', 'Colbert', 'Daily', 'Show', 'Colbert', 'Report', 'Chuck', 'Noblet', 'God-fearing', 'married', 'science', 'teacher', 'trying', 'shake', 'off', 'lustful', 'desires', 'art', 'teacher', 'Geoffrey', 'Jellineck', 'Paul', 'Dinello', '.The', 'budget-priced', 'DVD', 'stacked', 'extras', 'including', 'feature', 'commentary', 'Sedaris', 'Colbert', 'Dinello', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'music', 'video', 'Atomic', 'Car']",N/A

Successful TV series cannot always transfer to the silver screen.  But I give Strangers with Candy credit for attempting to make a longer prequel version of the show.  They did not stray from the shocking, repetitive humor that fans of the series love and adore.  Personally, that is why I watch the show.The cameos were a bit much for me.  Sarah Jessica Parker was pretty fun in her two little scenes, as was Matthew Broderick.  Everyone else seemed out of place in their bizarre, very small bit parts.  And most did not mesh well with the feeling that the show had.Amy Sedaris is hilarious.  Stephen Colbert and Paul Dinello are incredibly talented, with one of the most hilarious story lines.  I loved these characters on the show, and I still love in them in the film.  The funny parts may have been few and far between, but they were good when they happened.Yes I feel the movie was merely a glorified, prolonged episode, but that is all I wanted.

1012163,A27FR2C67JPDRS,B000HC2OBO,Daryl B,"[3, 3]","Some of us just have an addiction to candy.....""Strangers With Candy"", that is!  And for those die-hard fans of Comedy Central's wickedly funny, politically incorrect homage to those after school specials we grew up with, the movie is a nice little gift from the warped minds of creators Paul Dinello, Stephen Colbert and Amy Sedaris.With the movie, we are given a prequel of the television series, showing us Jerri's arrival at home after a long stay in prison and a life of drug abuse, prostitution and God knows what else!  As Jerri returns to school we are reintroduced to characters we already know, such as closeted lovers Chuck Noblet and Geoffery Jellineck as well as Principal Blackman, Tammy Littlenut and Jerri's evil step mother (played by the wonderfully talented, Deborah Rush).  Of course, for any fan, it is Amy Sedaris' trollish, chipmunk faced character Jerri Blank that is the true draw to the series and the film.  Jerry is a great character, at once the victim and the perpertrator, wanting to do good and fit in but finding that her dark side emerges a bit too often!The story for the film centers around Jerri trying to find away to bring ""Daddy"" out of a coma by doing something that will make him proud.  She settles on participating in the Science fair but, of course, has trouble focusing her mind on the task at hand.  Adding conflict is Matthew Broderick as Roger Beekman, a flamboyant 9 time winner of the state sciene fair, brought in by Principal Blackman as a sure fire chance to win and prove that there are, indeed, students in his school that have a ounce of intelligence (and thereby satisfying Board of Education bigwigs played by Allison Janey and Phillip Seymour-Hoffman).  Jerri must decide, be a team player and do the right thing, or hang out with school kids and maybe get lucky with the school stud!Fans of the show will enjoy some silly but typical ""Candy"" jokes, such as a gym sport modelled after the running of the bulls in Pamplona.  And big name actors and fans of the show are peppered throughout the movie----Sarah Jessica Parker, Matthew Broderick, Phillip Seymour-Hoffman, Allison Janey, Sir Ian Holm, Kristen Johnston and Justin Theroux, round out the cast along with the originals.  A couple of characters such as Derek, Jerri's half brother and Orlando, are now played by new actors.Now, the 100,000 dollar question....Is the movie as good as the televison series?  In my opinion, no.  The 30 minute time period is perfect showcase for a show like ""Strangers With Candy"" and it was cancelled well before its time.  Many of those episodes are classic and I still fall out laughing when I watch them on dvd.  Should fans of the show see it?  ABSOLUTELY!  We can only hope that one day, Comedy Central will see the error of their ways and bring this dark and deliciously sinful show back from the dead!  In the meantime, we'll settle for watching Jerri on the big screen.I'm hoping that we'll get some extras on the dvd!  Definitely recommended for fans of the show!  And if your not a fan, you probably wouldn't get the jokes anyway!",4,GIMME SOME CANDY!!!!,1153353600,"07 20, 2006",2006,3089,"['just', 'have', 'addiction', 'candy', 'Strangers', 'Candy', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'wickedly', 'funny', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'homage', 'school', 'specials', 'grew', 'up', 'movie', 'nice', 'little', 'gift', 'warped', 'minds', 'creators', 'Paul', 'Dinello', 'Stephen', 'Colbert', 'Amy', 'Sedaris.With', 'movie', 'are', 'given', 'prequel', 'television', 'series', 'showing', 'Jerri', 'arrival', 'home', 'long', 'stay', 'prison', 'life', 'drug', 'abuse', 'prostitution', 'God', 'what', 'else', 'Jerri', 'school', 'are', 'reintroduced', 'characters', 'already', 'know', 'such', 'closeted', 'lovers', 'Chuck', 'Noblet', 'Geoffery', 'Jellineck', 'as', 'well', 'Principal', 'Blackman', 'Tammy', 'Littlenut', 'Jerri', 'evil', 'step', 'mother', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'talented', 'Deborah', 'Rush', 'course', 'fan', 'Amy', 'Sedaris', 'trollish', 'chipmunk', 'faced', 'character', 'Jerri', 'Blank', 'true', 'draw', 'series', 'film', 'Jerry', 'great', 'character', 'once', 'victim', 'perpertrator', 'wanting', 'do', 'good', 'fit', 'finding', 'dark', 'side', 'bit', 'too', 'often', 'story', 'film', 'centers', 'Jerri', 'trying', 'find', 'away', 'bring', 'Daddy', 'coma', 'doing', 'something', 'will', 'make', 'proud', 'participating', 'Science', 'fair', 'course', 'trouble', 'focusing', 'mind', 'task', 'hand', 'Adding', 'conflict', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'Roger', 'Beekman', 'flamboyant', '9', 'time', 'winner', 'state', 'sciene', 'fair', 'brought', 'Principal', 'Blackman', 'sure', 'fire', 'chance', 'win', 'prove', 'are', 'indeed', 'students', 'school', 'have', 'ounce', 'intelligence', 'thereby', 'satisfying', 'Board', 'Education', 'bigwigs', 'played', 'Allison', 'Janey', 'Phillip', 'Seymour-Hoffman', 'Jerri', 'must', 'decide', 'be', 'team', 'player', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'out', 'school', 'kids', 'maybe', 'get', 'lucky', 'school', 'stud', 'Fans', 'show', 'will', 'enjoy', 'silly', 'typical', 'Candy', 'jokes', 'such', 'gym', 'sport', 'modelled', 'running', 'bulls', 'Pamplona', 'big', 'name', 'actors', 'fans', 'show', 'are', 'peppered', 'movie', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'Phillip', 'Seymour-Hoffman', 'Allison', 'Janey', 'Sir', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'Kristen', 'Johnston', 'Justin', 'Theroux', 'round', 'out', 'cast', 'originals', 'couple', 'characters', 'such', 'Derek', 'Jerri', 'half', 'brother', 'Orlando', 'are', 'now', 'played', 'new', 'actors.Now', '100,000', 'dollar', 'question', 'movie', 'as', 'good', 'televison', 'series', 'opinion', '30', 'minute', 'time', 'period', 'perfect', 'showcase', 'show', 'Strangers', 'Candy', 'was', 'cancelled', 'well', 'time', 'Many', 'episodes', 'are', 'classic', 'still', 'fall', 'out', 'laughing', 'when', 'watch', 'dvd', 'Should', 'fans', 'show', 'see', 'ABSOLUTELY', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'one', 'day', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'will', 'see', 'error', 'ways', 'bring', 'dark', 'deliciously', 'sinful', 'show', 'back', 'dead', 'meantime', ""'ll"", 'settle', 'watching', 'Jerri', 'big', 'screen.I', ""'m"", 'hoping', ""'ll"", 'get', 'extras', 'dvd', 'Definitely', 'recommended', 'fans', 'show', 'not', 'fan', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'get', 'jokes', 'anyway']",N/A

The only time I had a real belly laugh is when Gerri, the middle-aged J.D., is swapping feminine change-of-life stories with a pubescent classmate.

Most of the original crew are represented which was a feat unto itself. The original tv show was maybe the funniest show ever. The characters and dialogue are so well done, and with little fanfare.Through an almost underground following we have this last episode in the life and times of Jerry Blank. This movie does not disappoint there are so many funny lines in this it does the show justice. Onyx  Blackman is back in trouble with his gambling addiction and needs to show the school board that he can produce intelligent students. Meanwhile Jerry Blank has just enrolled after a 32 year prison sentence to further complicate his goal. Science teacher turned religous man- Chuck Noblet is at his best in this one. He must decide whether his new found religous beliefs are more important to him than his love for the flamboyant art teacher Geoffrey Jellineck. So many great moments when Chuck teaches his class( eyes to the back of the room). There is even a celebrity couple who play roles in this one. If you have seen the original series then what are you waiting for? And if you are new to this series, you may want to watch some of the dvds from the original seasons to brush up on it a bit. They add some background to some of the humor and jokes.

The original concept for the three-season cult series was a fun idea full of possibilities, satirizing the high-minded seriousness of the ABC Afternoon Specials in the 1970's by having the hapless Jerri learn some significant life lesson after going through some humiliating situation. Probably a disappointment to dedicated fans of the show, the 2006 movie is really no different except the paper-thin plot feels dragged out to its eighty-minute length (wisely cut from its 97-minute length in theaters). It has the additional burden of feeling repetitive of the series without providing much more in the way of texture or complexity.Director Paul Dinello (who plays effete art teacher Geoffrey Jellineck), along with co-writers Sedaris and Stephen Colbert (who plays closeted science teacher Chuck Noblet), uses the opportunity to fill in a bit of Jerri's back story in coming back to the family home and dealing with her father's comatose state. According to kindly Dr. Putney, the only cure lies with Jerri's efforts to do her father proud by winning the school science fair. Of course, the easily misdirected Jerri wants to be part of the in-crowd, in particular, getting horizontal with Brason, the school's hunky squat-and-thrust champion. This consequently means turning her back on her science project team, the Fig Neutrons, which includes Tammi, Jerri's best friend and object of Sapphic desire, and Megawatti, the Indonesian geek who has an unexplainable crush on Jerri. Lots of hijinks ensue until the inevitable conclusion, including the insertion of several star cameos - Allison Janney and Philip Seymour Hoffman as bickering school board members, Sarah Jessica Parker as self-absorbed grief counselor Peggy Callas, Ian Holm as Dr. Putney, Dan Hedaya as Jerri's comatose father; and Kristen Johnston as a wheelchair-bound coach. Matthew Broderick actually has a bigger role as Noblet's adversary, the preening Roger Beekman.Much of the TV series cast is here as well with Colbert the standout as the blustery, uptight Chuck who secretly yearns for Geoffrey, who spurns him to be Roger's idea man. For most of the time, it is fitfully funny if only because the scabrous screenplay takes no prisoners in its approach. Consider this the comic flipside to ""Sherrybaby"" with plenty of familiar elements from ""Carrie"" and ""Napoleon Dynamite"" thrown in for good measure. But most of all, it is a tribute to Sedaris' Borat-like transformative skills as a comic actress. The 2006 DVD has a commentary track by Sedaris, Colbert and Dinello, and although they are obviously having a good time together, much of that rapport surprisingly does not translate well for the viewer. There are eighteen minutes worth of deleted scenes, most understandably excised though interestingly, it looks like Parker's counselor was the chief victim of the cuts. Also included are the theatrical trailer (another case of a promising trailer that's a lot funnier than the movie itself) and a music video for Delano Grove's ""Atomic Car"".",3,Amy Sedaris' Borat-Level Transformation Only Goes So Far in a Fitfully Funny Comedy,1170374400,"02 2, 2007",2007,3324,"['What', 'remarkable', 'translation', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'TV', 'show', 'mainstream', 'feature', 'film', 'Amy', 'Sedaris', 'complete', 'lack', 'vanity', 'replaying', 'comic', 'alter-ego', 'aptly', 'named', 'Jerri', 'Blank', '47-year', 'old', 'ex-con', 'who', 'return', 'home', 'lengthy', 'prison', 'term', 'finish', 'high', 'school', 'original', 'concept', 'three-season', 'cult', 'series', 'was', 'fun', 'idea', 'full', 'possibilities', 'satirizing', 'high-minded', 'seriousness', 'ABC', 'Afternoon', 'Specials', '1970', 'having', 'hapless', 'Jerri', 'significant', 'life', 'lesson', 'going', 'humiliating', 'situation', 'Probably', 'disappointment', 'dedicated', 'fans', 'show', '2006', 'movie', 'really', 'different', 'paper-thin', 'plot', 'feels', 'dragged', 'out', 'eighty-minute', 'length', 'wisely', 'cut', '97-minute', 'length', 'theaters', 'additional', 'burden', 'feeling', 'repetitive', 'series', 'providing', 'much', 'more', 'way', 'texture', 'complexity.Director', 'Paul', 'Dinello', 'who', 'effete', 'art', 'teacher', 'Geoffrey', 'Jellineck', 'co-writers', 'Sedaris', 'Stephen', 'Colbert', 'who', 'closeted', 'science', 'teacher', 'Chuck', 'Noblet', 'opportunity', 'fill', 'bit', 'Jerri', 'back', 'story', 'coming', 'back', 'family', 'home', 'dealing', 'father', 'comatose', 'state', 'According', 'kindly', 'Dr.', 'Putney', 'only', 'cure', 'Jerri', 'efforts', 'do', 'father', 'proud', 'winning', 'school', 'science', 'fair', 'course', 'easily', 'misdirected', 'Jerri', 'be', 'part', 'in-crowd', 'particular', 'getting', 'horizontal', 'Brason', 'school', 'hunky', 'squat-and-thrust', 'champion', 'consequently', 'turning', 'back', 'science', 'project', 'team', 'Fig', 'Neutrons', 'Tammi', 'Jerri', 'best', 'friend', 'object', 'Sapphic', 'desire', 'Megawatti', 'Indonesian', 'geek', 'who', 'unexplainable', 'crush', 'Jerri', 'Lots', 'hijinks', 'ensue', 'inevitable', 'conclusion', 'including', 'insertion', 'several', 'star', 'cameos', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'bickering', 'school', 'board', 'members', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'self-absorbed', 'grief', 'counselor', 'Peggy', 'Callas', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'Dr.', 'Putney', 'Dan', 'Hedaya', 'Jerri', 'comatose', 'father', 'Kristen', 'Johnston', 'wheelchair-bound', 'coach', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'actually', 'bigger', 'role', 'Noblet', 'adversary', 'preening', 'Roger', 'Beekman.Much', 'TV', 'series', 'cast', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'Colbert', 'standout', 'blustery', 'uptight', 'Chuck', 'who', 'secretly', 'Geoffrey', 'who', 'be', 'Roger', 'idea', 'man', 'most', 'time', 'fitfully', 'funny', 'only', 'scabrous', 'screenplay', 'prisoners', 'approach', 'Consider', 'comic', 'flipside', 'Sherrybaby', 'plenty', 'familiar', 'elements', 'Carrie', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure', 'most', 'tribute', 'Sedaris', 'Borat-like', 'transformative', 'skills', 'comic', 'actress', '2006', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'track', 'Sedaris', 'Colbert', 'Dinello', 'are', 'obviously', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'together', 'much', 'rapport', 'surprisingly', 'not', 'translate', 'well', 'viewer', 'are', 'eighteen', 'minutes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'most', 'understandably', 'excised', 'interestingly', 'Parker', 'counselor', 'was', 'chief', 'victim', 'cuts', 'Also', 'included', 'are', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'case', 'promising', 'trailer', 'lot', 'funnier', 'movie', 'music', 'video', 'Delano', 'Grove', 'Atomic', 'Car']",N/A

For example take a good movie like ""Starwars"". Remember what happened when George Lucas felt the need to explain how Anakin Skywalker became Darth Vader. Another example is the overrated ""Batman Begins"" in which half the movie involves how Bruce Wayne became Batman. They even felt the need to explain how he choose the ears for his Bat costume...yes, it was aweful..This movie isn't aweful, but it didn't offer anything new and lacked alot of the creativity of the original show. Many times I felt they were just going through the motions (not really emotionally involved). Many of the actors from the original show are back, except for Jerrys orginal father, brother and her best friend in highschool ""coconut head"".

1012170,A17E28QEX42YU0,B000HC2OBO,"Jason ""Hastaj00""","[5, 7]","I was never a member of the cultish fan base that belongs to 'Strangers With Candy' (I preferred the somewhat similar 'Upright Citizens Brigade' far more, around the same time -- both airing on Comedy Central), but I did always enjoy the show when I happened to catch it, simply because it was so unique and absurd. Honestly, it was a bit strange hearing that they were making a transition to film so long after the show began, but naturally I was up for it and hoped for the best... and I was pretty disappointed.The lamest aspect of this film is that it doesn't do anything differently than the show did for a great deal (!) of years. What's up? I mean, sure, we are to expect an overall ambience that is familiar, but I couldn't differentiate the movie from any particular episode, aside from the (overlong, at only an hour and a half) running time. It's Jerri doing the same schtick, with the unchanged type of people in the high school. Yes, that's fine and all, but if this is your tact, then you'd better provide consistently funny writing and, if it's not asking too much, some sort of interesting storyline. Yeah.... 'Strangers With Candy' is not armed with such pleasures.I've always admired Amy Sedaris' ability to showcase her character as utterly repulsive, not so much mentally but physically. I mean, ugggggly; there's very little chance you'd think the actress playing Jerri underneath the makeup and expressions would be remotely normal looking, but Sedaris is, aesthetically, arguably a truly beautiful woman. I mean, what attractive actress would have the balls (figuratively _!_) to put themselves in such a position? None I can think of. But more than that, Sedaris really --is-- a brilliant comedian. I tend to come from the vantage point that, as sexist as it may sound, females lack the cardinal comedic abilities that make the paramount male comedians out there so outstanding -- just look at the rarely-changing inclination of the most renowned female comedians to possess more male personality attributes than female -- but there are exceptions... Sedaris, as Jerri Blank, is one of them... In this movie rendition, she has just as many moments that don't work as ones that do, but the ones that do prevail, soar... As with such performances, communicating the true magnificence with words is ultimately an act shrouded in futility, but I'd say that her manic, subtle bodily expressions and grotesque vocal delivery are most responsible for the humorous glory. And, with this overall execution of character, she accomplished what so few performers have allowed me to witness, providing an utterly unique sense of humor and wit that noone else can claim to possess. Again, it doesn't always work (and I personally think the direction is mostly to blame for this, even if the funniest moments must also be proudly accountable to the same director), but its oft radiance overcomes this.So really, it's these glimpses of genius that make the movie at all worth watching. There are some completely wasted cameos by great actors (Philip Seymour Hoffman, Matthew Broderick), and characters such as Paul Dinello's art teacher, that I've seen be so funny in the show, are near worthless. I will, however, admit that Stephen Colbert's performance is absolutely hysterical (intensely demanding his classroom to turn around so he can weep miserably). I have mixed feelings about Colbert -- I revere him for being partly responsible for much of Cartoon Network's 'Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law"", but I can't really stand his political personality -- thankfully, his behavior in both the show and movie is a riot.Overall, as a full-out experience, I'd probably bestow 'Strangers With Candy' two stars. Yet, like so many of my most treasured [live-action] shows ('Upright Citizens Brigade', 'Mr. Show', 'Curb Your Enthusiasm'), the greatness often arrives in spontaneous bursts, albeit at amply consistent intervals... and this greatness helps overcome so much of the mediocrity that can be found elsewhere in 'Strangers With Candy'. In this case, I honestly posit the particular trend is due more to laziness than, say, an unavailing result of over-ambition (with something like 'Mr. Show'), but I don't really mind that.I will also mention that, in my opinion, it's pretty feasible the people who aren't able to reap anything from the movie's finer moments, will, as a whole, regard the movie an utter abomination.I think [hope] I got my points across (with WAY more words than I'd have liked)...",3,Mixed bag,1173484800,"03 10, 2007",2007,4512,"['was', 'never', 'member', 'cultish', 'fan', 'base', ""'Strangers"", 'Candy',

1012173,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B000HC2OBO,Joseph Haschka,"[1, 18]","Ok,ok. I realize that Hollywood targets its movies on the 13-25 crowd. But, jeez!STRANGERS WITH CANDY is based on a past TV series. I wish I'd seen at least one episode on the small screen so I wouldn't have wasted money on the theater release. But, as far as TV is concerned, I tend to follow what Groucho Marx said: ""I find television very educating. Every time somebody turns on the set, I go into the other room and read a book."" Except, of course, when DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES is on.Here, 46-year old Jerri Blank (Amy Sedaris), upon release from decades in prison, returns home to find her mother dead and her father remarried. Dad's in a stress-related coma and under the care of a physician (Ian Holm) that apparently still makes housecalls, something in itself which defies credulity. Because there's evidence that her return might snap her Old Man out of it, Jerri decides to become the perfect daughter and take up where she left off before she was sent up to the Big House, i.e., go back to high school. Her first class is Science 101, where, after announcing to her classmates that she's an ex-prostitute, ex-drug abuser, and addicted to gambling, she signs up for the upcoming regional Science Project Competition. The school's black chief administrator, Principal Blackman (Greg Hollimon) - get it? - is under pressure from the $ disbursers to demonstrate some minimal intelligence among his students. So, he brings in Roger Beekman (Matthew Broderick), a sort of hired gun science teacher known for his ability to mastermind award-winning projects. Jerri's class, otherwise taught by the gay and shamelessly self-absorbed Chuck Noblet (Stephen Colbert), is divided up into two teams, the nerds (including Jerri) under Noblet and the beautiful/handsome popular kids under Beekman, which will submit separate contest entries - and may the best team win.For me, the insurmountable problem with this film is that there's no one in it to like. The scriptwriters naturally placed that burden on the Jerri character, created to be endearing in a goofy sort of way, I guess, but who just manages to be a pathetic grotesque. At times, STRANGERS WITH CANDY manages to be downright unpleasant, and is consistently moronic.At one point, the girls' PE class is given a pep talk by a wheel chair-bound invalid who was injured in Pamplona's running of the bulls. So what's the exercise for the day? Why, of course, being chased through a walled-off maze in the gym by a pair of black steers. Yup, made sense to me.As the film unrolled through its one and three-quarter hours and I slid further and further down into my seat, the faint smile on my face was one of unbelieving perplexity. Studio execs actually approved this project? And how were such otherwise fine actors as Holm and Philip Seymour Hoffman, who played a judge in the competition, lured into such?

1012174,A3SKGQSU29ZV80,B000HC2OBO,Lleu Christopher,"[27, 30]","Even though I was a fan of the Comedy Central TV series that it's based on, I did not have the highest expectations for this film. Maybe thinking of the many so-so adaptations of movies based on Saturday Night Live sketches and the like, I would have been satisfied with a few laughs. Instead, I found this to be a brilliant, hilarious, almost perfect rendition of the uniquely bizarre, radically Un-PC series. Perhaps it was because they virtually transplanted the entire cast of writers and actors from the series to the big screen, nothing was lost. Amy Sedaris plays Jerri Blank, the freaky middle-aged bisexual drug addict who, just out of prison, tries to fit in at high school and at home with her equally bizarre family. Stephen Colbert and Paul Dinello reprise their roles as, respectively, the science and art teacher who are having a secret affair. This is made more amusing by the fact that Noblet (Colbert) is a fundamentalist who teaches that evolution is a fraud. At home, Jerri has a father who is in a coma (in the TV series, the father was a literal dummy; here he is played by an actor), a stepmother and stepbrother who despise her, and the stepmother's always-present ""meat man"" boyfriend who only wants to watch TV. The film actually has a fairly conventional plot involving a science fair competition, which reigns in the weirdness to some extent.Strangers With Candy is not for everyone; in particular, it's not for the politically or culturally sensitive. The black principal at Jerry's high school, who has a gambling problem, is actually named Onyx Blackman; there are a constant stream of jokes at the expense of various ethnic types and homosexuals. Jerri has a confederate flag hanging in her bedroom, a detail that is not even spoken of. Sedaris does her utmost  to make her alter ego Jerri as unattractive, stupid and, in many ways even repulsive as possible. Viewers are alternately tempted to laugh at her, feel sorry for her and simply shake their heads at her utter cluelessness. This, along with the rest of the uniformly weird characters makes for a kind of comedy that is both slapstick and absurd and at the same time hard-edged. It lacks the soft, sentimental core of mainstream comedies. You realize that these people are truly &%$#ed-up beyond repair and they are never going to change. This is, I suppose, sad, but it is also funny and, in its own way, more honest than most of what Hollywood dishes out.Strangers With Candy is a thorough send-up of conventionality, moralistic cliches and the self-righteous hypocrisy of many authority figures. I suppose, along with shows like The Simpsons and South Park, it could be called cynical, even nihilistic in its portrayal of everyone as selfish and corrupt. But the complete absurdity of it all, which borders on the surreal, prevents us from taking its amorality any more seriously than we can take the pseudo-morality of its dysfunctional parents, teachers and school administrators. I found it to be the funniest movie I've seen in a long time.",5,"Jerri Blank, a hilarious anti-heroine",1153008000,"07 16, 2006",2006,3038,"['Even', 'was', 'fan', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'TV', 'series', 'based', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'highest', 'expectations', 'film', 'Maybe', 'thinking', 'many', 'so-so', 'adaptations', 'movies', 'based', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'sketches', 'like', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'satisfied', 'few', 'laughs', 'Instead', 'found', 'be', 'brilliant', 'hilarious', 'almost', 'perfect', 'rendition', 'uniquely', 'bizarre', 'radically', 'Un-PC', 'series', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'virtually', 'transplanted', 'entire', 'cast', 'writers', 'actors', 'series', 'big', 'screen', 'nothing', 'was', 'lost', 'Amy', 'Sedaris', 'Jerri', 'Blank', 'freaky', 'middle-aged', 'bisexual', 'drug', 'addict', 'who', 'just', 'prison', 'tries', 'fit', 'high', 'school', 'home', 'equally', 'bizarre', 'family', 'Stephen', 'Colbert', 'Paul', 'Dinello', 'reprise', 'roles', 'respectively', 'science', 'art', 'teacher', 'who', 'are', 'having', 'secret', 'affair', 'made', 'more', 'amusing', 'fact', 'Noblet', 'Colbert', 'fundamentalist', 'who', 'evolution', 'fraud', 'home', 'Jerri', 'father', 'who', 'coma', 'TV', 'series', 'father', 'was', 'literal', 'dummy', 'here', 'played', 'actor', 'stepmother', 'stepbrother', 'who', 'stepmother', 'always-present', 'meat', 'man', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'only', 'watch', 'TV', 'film', 'actually', 'fairly', 'conventional', 'plot', 'involving', 'science', 'fair', 'competition', 'weirdness', 'extent.Strangers', 'Candy', 'not', 'everyone', 'particular', 'not', 'politically', 'culturally', 'sensitive', 'black', 'principal', 'Jerry', 'high', 'school', 'who', 'gambling', 'problem', 'actually', 'named', 'Onyx', 'Blackman', 'are', 'constant', 'stream', 'jokes', 'expense', 'various', 'ethnic', 'types', 'homosexuals', 'Jerri', 'confederate', 'flag', 'hanging', 'bedroom', 'detail', 'not', 'even', 'spoken', 'Sedaris', 'utmost', 'make', 'alter', 'ego', 'Jerri', 'unattractive', 'stupid', 'many', 'ways', 'even', 'repulsive', 'possible', 'Viewers', 'are', 'alternately', 'tempted', 'laugh', 'feel', 'sorry', 'simply', 'shake', 'heads', 'utter', 'cluelessness', 'rest', 'uniformly', 'weird', 'characters', 'kind', 'comedy', 'slapstick', 'absurd', 'same', 'time', 'hard-edged', 'soft', 'sentimental', 'core', 'mainstream', 'comedies', 'realize', 'people', 'are', 'truly', '%', 'ed-up', 'repair', 'are', 'never', 'going', 'change', 'suppose', 'sad', 'also', 'funny', 'own', 'way', 'more', 'honest', 'most', 'what', 'Hollywood', 'out.Strangers', 'Candy', 'thorough', 'send-up', 'conventionality', 'moralistic', 'cliches', 'self-righteous', 'hypocrisy', 'many', 'authority', 'figures', 'suppose', 'shows', 'Simpsons', 'South', 'Park', 'could', 'be', 'called', 'cynical', 'even', 'nihilistic', 'portrayal', 'everyone', 'selfish', 'corrupt', 'complete', 'absurdity', 'surreal', 'prevents', 'taking', 'amorality', 'more', 'seriously', 'can', 'take', 'pseudo-morality', 'dysfunctional', 'parents', 'teachers', 'school', 'administrators', 'found', 'be', 'funniest', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time']",N/A

I'm a HUGE fan of The Colbert Report and Exit 57, so I was thrilled to find another movie full of Colbert comedic genius. He is absolute GOLD in this movie.

But that may have been part of the problem.  When I went to see this movie, the crowd was laughing almost non stop for the first half hour.  But the laughing died down and there are probably more than a few reasons.For one, the word ""retread"" comes to mind.  There are a few gags which are ripped straight from the series.  If one were to see these for the first time, they are hilarious.  However, they merely call in a chuckle from fans who've seen the gag before.  Clearly, the film strives to balance two potential audiences for the movie: those who know the material, and those who don't.The uninitiated may be coming for Stephen Colbert, who shines onscreen delivering with the same deadpan manner that has caused his rise to fame.  However, the humor is offbeat and dark, which may not exactly find a new auidence.  That leaves SWC fans wanting something new and not exactly finding it.  For them, a prequal may have not been the best idea.But it's not a bad film.  It just does some recycling and runs out steam in the second half.  There are points in the film that are hilarious.  Fans of the series will be happy to see the same likeable/unlikeable characters shine on screen with their same charm.  Greg Hollimen as Principal Blackman has some ""blink and you'll miss it"" moments and some great lines of dialogue.

I know. Many trailers make me laugh and then prove to be unfunny, stuffing all of the funny bits into a two minute advertisement for the film. Would ""Strangers With Candy"" prove to be the exception? Could it actually prove to be a good comedy?Jerri Blank (Amy Sedaris), an ex-con, ex-junkie and an ex-prostitute, returns to her family home after being released from a woman's prison. Upon her arrival, she finds her father (Dan Hedaya) has remarried a strange woman, her new stepmother (Deborah Rush) and they have a teenage son, Derrick (Joseph Cross). She also discovers Dad has been in a coma for a long, long time which the family doctor (Ian Holm) explains was brought on by disappointment, so Jerri decides to pick up her life where it left off, before prison, and will return to high school. Naturally, her new teenage step-brother is thrilled. In school, she meets the science teacher (Stephen Colbert) who has recently discovered God, the principal, Onyx Blackman (Greg Holliman) and the art teacher (Paul Dinello), who is taking his break-up with the science teacher poorly. Jerri wants to make her father proud and decides winning the upcoming school Science Fair will do the trick. But will her old habits and the teacher's personal problems affect the outcome?...Do Not Talk To Strangers....""Strangers with Candy"", directed by Dinello, co-written by Dinello, Colbert and Sedaris, and produced by David Letterman, contains some of the most biting humor I have heard in a long time. It also contains some of the most profane humor. In short; it is a funny, funny film....Don't Make Fun of People Simply Because They Are Different...You can't help but laugh the first moment Jerri appears, riding in a bus, having just been released from prison. As she remembers key moments of her incarceration; making a pass at a fellow prisoner in the shower as her jealous girlfriend watches, she provides a brief monologue about her life. An ex-con, ex-prostitute, ex-drug addict, she has had a difficult life, but looks forward to the road ahead.Sedaris' appearance is very funny; her face scrunched up, her eyebrow heavy and low, always ready with a nervous smile. She looks like the epitome of everything her life has been to that point, but she also has a level beyond that. She wants to embrace life, but has to fight a lifetime of demons and bad habits....You May Notice Some Strange Changes...As Jerri re-enters high school, she becomes determined to live the high school experience to the fullest. She wants to date the captain of the Squat and Thrust Team, who Derrick idolizes, and the cheerleader. She wants to have her new friend Tammi (Maria Thayer) over to study, but can't resist the urge to try to feel her up. Jerri's journey is funny for a variety of reasons. As adults we recognize some of her problems from our own journey through high school, but we also laugh because she is going through it again, at an age when most people are advancing in their careers and personal lives. But it is also funny to watch her struggle with all of the influences in her life, as any high school student would. Yet, Jerri's influences are like a normal high school student's influences on speed....Those Who Can't, Teach...""Strangers"" is designed as a parody of the television after school specials we grew up with. Everyone delivers their lines with the gravitas of bad actors, as they mimic the serious tone prevalent in these shows. Colbert is especially good at delivering a line with hyper-seriousness then pausing for dramatic effect, to let it sink in....Those Who Can't Teach, Teach Gym...The supporting cast is universally amusing and adds a lot of laughs. One of the standouts is Colbert as Chuck Noblett, the science teacher. Having recently discovered God, he tells his students to open their science text books to Psalms 13 and the students open Bibles. He also wrestles with his newfound Christianity and his gay extra-marital relationship with the art teacher. But all of these influences distract him from what is most important in his life, himself. The other standout is Paul Dinello, as Geoffrey Jellineck, the art teacher who would rather create something fast than create something beautiful. Geoffrey simply wants attention and when Chuck begins to go through his crisis, Geoffrey quickly finds attention from the new science teacher, Roger Beekman (Matthew Broderick), who is followed around by his biographer.Sarah Jessica Parker, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Allison Janey, Dan Hedaya and Ian Holm round out the supporting cast, providing memorable cameos as some of the people in Jerri's life....Everyday Provides New Challenges...""Candy"" is a surprisingly consistent film. It isn't a laugh a minute, but there are funny moments and truly off the wall comedy throughout. ""Candy"" certainly isn't for everyone; a lot of the humor is very profane, but if you are willing to go along for the ride, you'll have fun....If thornhill Recommends a Film, You Should See

1012191,A2EFA8TUP4TF96,B000HC2OBO,"Uhnghrid ""Grope""","[0, 1]","Well, the title of this review pretty much sums it up. Amy Sedaris's performance, of course, is not what I'm referring to as ""lackluster."" She's definitely the talent in the movie. Her character is horrifying and her acting of the role is absolutely perfect.The concept, an aged ex-drug addict ex-prostitute trying to fit in at a highschool, is not only funny, but also thought provoking and disturbing. It's quite amazing how uncomfortable this movie can make the viewer at times. The repulsive crudeness of Sedaris's character as seen interacting with fresh-faced innocent highschool kids is simply priceless.It's a shame that they didn't exploit the full potential of this idea. The clash shown in this movie between segments of society that almost never associate with eachother, and the discomfort this creates, makes this movie not just a comedy but also a really interesting social statement. It's almost a work of art, really.However, much of the potential of the concept is wasted by the fact that most of the secondary characters act silly and fake, in a sort of ""I'm in a comedy movie so I don't have to act realistically"" way. Since the whole point of the movie is the awkwardness of an ex-prostitute's interactions with innocent highschool kids, you'd think they'd make more effort when it came to fleshing out those interactions. If they had, the movie could have been both hilarious and fascinating. As it is, it's funny and unsettling, but just not as powerful as it could be in either respect.Oh, and I hate to say it... but Colbert isn't that funny here. Shame.I'd really like to see a serious version of this concept. Or a remake with a more interesting script and some actual character development among the highschool characters.
