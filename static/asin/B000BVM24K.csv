To criticize this movie would be like trying to find fault with a newborn baby or a magical sunset.I was moved beyond my tears to a special place where I felt warm, uplifted, and happy.  The filmmakers didn't have to assault my senses with a barrage of ""F"" bombs or gratuitous nudity and sex scenes--nor did they see any need to incorporate any distracting or annoying peripheral characters to disturb my focus on the leads and the evolving love story.Here we see just 3 average wonderful young men--- 2 masculine, handsome adults and a young mentally challenged little brother with a tenderness for each other that drew me to them instantly and made me wish the movie was twice as long as it actually is.The acting, dialogue, and cinematography are all to my liking.  Never once do any of the 3 male leads say anything sarcastic, hurtful or mean spirited to each other.  Nothing else is needed but the wonderful chemistry between them.  This is most often why I watch movies--- to be entertained and uplifted.  I don't need every film to be vulgar, profane, shocking, disturbing, or frightening to hold my attention.  In my world, thankfully, there will always be a yearning for simplistic beauty, tenderness, and warm happy endings.Kudos to all involved in this wonderful little gem!

950895,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B000BVM24K,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[4, 9]","In the indie drama ""Regarding Billy"" (2005), 20-something Billy (Ronnie Kerr) returns home after his parents are killed in an accident, in order to care for his mildly-retarded younger brother, Johnny (Jack Sway), who was devastated by their deaths.  A short time later, they also take in Dean (Jason Van Eman), Billy's best friend from childhood, who recently returned wounded from a tour of duty in Iraq.  As they share a home, Billy realizes that he has not outgrown his boyhood attraction to the hunky Dean, and agonizes over telling him about his feelings.  Meanwhile, Dean is worried about becoming a burden to the boys.Without giving away the entire story, that's about all I can possibly tell you about this thinly-plotted film, which is about as predictable as a tic-tac-toe game.  Filmed on a tiny $20,000 budget in just over a week, writer/director/producer Jeff London does a passable job, despite some overly dramatic ""fade"" shots, some dialogue that's so syrupy sweet it can cause tooth decay, and a cast that tends to overacting and drawing out every one of the many emotional scenes in the story.  To his credit, he used ordinary-looking actors with whom the gay ""everyman"" can identify, rather than the usual A&F; clones that seem to populate most gay cinema.  The teen who plays Johnny does a good job with a difficult role, and Van Eman makes a convincing military veteran (Liner notes say he also had an uncredited role in ""Jarhead"").DVD Extras include deleted scenes and (in a reprise of the final scene in the film) the cast gathered together for a reading of ""Twas The Night Before Chirstmas.""  There is also supposed to be a commentary track, but it did not work on the DVD I bought.

950899,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000BVM24K,Grady Harp,"[2, 2]","Jeff London (The Last Year, And Then Came Summer) is a writer and director who takes on some tough subject matter about the ordinary men in gay life and fashions simple stories that, while not earth shattering, are delicate reminders of the non-sensational aspects of coming to grips with sexuality. In REGARDING BILLY, his best film to date, he has assembled a small cast of fine young actors (only three), and offers a film that for a $[...]. budget and two weeks of shooting time shows how sensitive little movies can be.Opening inside a tent on a camping trip, we meet Billy (Ronnie Kerr) and Dean (Jason Van Eman) who have been best friends since childhood. Dean announces he has joined the military to address his life stance (his parents are long gone) and will be going to Iraq. Billy is obviously sad and both young men begin to tell each other something...'but it can wait until morning'. In the next scene Billy is seen with his mentally challenged sweet kid brother Johnny (Jack Sway) as they have returned from the funeral of their parents who have died in an accident. Billy comforts Johnny and moves back to the home he had left to care for his brother. While Dean is in Iraq he writes Billy and Billy fantasizes about Dean's returning home. When indeed Dean does come back from his tour of duty, injured irreparably in the war, Billy insists that Dean move in with the brothers. Despite the obvious new happiness of the three young men living together, there remains an underlying tension between Billy and Dean, a tension broken only by a moment of confession regarding feelings that is one of the more tender 'coming out' scenes yet filmed. The film ends as quietly as it begins with the power of love and extended family as the theme.All three of the actors perform well despite a script that calls for excessive crying. Kerr and Van Eman are understated hunks that make the attraction and resolution of the plot completely credible. Yes, there are some awkward lines and shaky moments in the film, but the overall effect is one of a loving product that dares to be sentimental in the face of criticism because the creators obviously believe in the story. REGARDING BILLY is a refreshing change from the usual over the top gay films, a film more about core people than the peripheral characters usually in focus. Recommended.

950901,AQQFI7YHMRL7S,B000BVM24K,James Morris,"[2, 9]","You never know with a gay independent film if you will love it or hate it.  The reviews for this film seem evenly split both ways.  I took a chance and ordered it, assuming that I would either fall into the camp that loved it or side with those who hated it.  I am sorry to report that I belong to the group that utterly loathed it.  In retrospect, if find it odd that nobody seemed to fall in the middle, which causes me to suspect that some of the rave reviews that prompted me to purchase it were planted here by friends of the cast or its creators.  Either that or they are as mentally challenged as the character of Johnny is supposed to be.  Thank goodness I had a dose of insulin at the ready.[...]I have nothing against low budget - I have seen more than my share of poorly-financed gay films that I genuinely enjoyed.  But I'm afraid that Regarding Billy hit a big ten on my barf meter.  I might have liked it better had it not been so emotionally manipulative.  Shortly into the second scene, the music swells and one of the characters suddenly begins to sniffle, a prelude to the spectacle of watching a grown man burst into tears.  Throughout the entire film, whenever one of the three characters is about to start bawling, we are warned of the coming storm by snatches of bad soundtrack that sound like it's left over from Brian's Song or Love Story.  [...]Then again, I may have been more satisfied with Regarding Billy had the wafer-thin plot not been drawn out way too much, even for a film that barely ran seventy minutes.  The two lead characters are supposed to be best friends of many years, each concealing and bearing the dreaded secret that he is in love with the other.  When it came time for the big revelation (about sixty-eight minutes overdue), and one of the actors grabbed the other to plant a kiss on his mouth, I frankly thought I was going to puke.  Then again, I may have been more impressed if all three characterizations had not come across as so phony - each appears to be trying to outdo the other two in the ""nice guy"" department, trading sappy lines and oozing charm and good-nature, despite one poorly-written excuse for crocodile tears after another.  ""Gee, Dean, I guess this is about the best Christmas tree light display ever"".  ""Yeah, buddy, it sure is"".  Does anybody think that people really talk like this?  I might have been able to stand the phony sweetness had it been confined to one scene, but each new camera angle seemed to proffer but one of two moods; sickeningly sweet, or melodramatically melancholy.  And each bit of dialogue as phony as the last.I wasted a very long hour and ten minutes of my life watching Regarding Billy, not to mention about 45 seconds on the overly-sweet, poorly done reading of ""The Night Before Christmas"" included as the special feature - thank goodness I reached for the remote and stopped that one quick, as soon as I felt the bile rising in my stomach.  To give you an idea of this thoughtfully included extra, let's just say that the least able of the three dramatically challenged actors reads the celebrated Clement Clarke Moore poem in its entirety, while the other two look profoundly embarrassed.  This film has now earned its spot as third on my list of the three worst gay movies ever made, falling just after Visions of Sugar Plums (DREADFUL, and possibly the second-worst gay movie ever made) and Ben and Arthur (still #1 on my list of gay films deserving the Ed Wood Award).Of course, I haven't yet wasted all my resources on badly-written, poorly acted and ineptly directed independent gay vehicles.

Ronnie Kerr is perfect as Billy.  He is genuine, childlike, honest, handsome, wistful, and well-built, with remarkably expressive eyes.  Dean, his long-time best friend, announces unexpectedly that he has enlisted, and abruptly leaves home.  Jason Van Eman plays Dean in a warm, forthright manner, and the two good-looking leads have a nice, playful - but very frustrating - friendship.  Incapable of articulating their feelings, Dean departs with much left unsaid.By the time the injured Dean returns, Billy is caring for his learning-disabled younger brother, and the story really begins.  The three young men learn to become a family and, though each has a handicap to deal with, their unerring love pre-ordains the powerful and intimate conclusion.The film has its faults, to be sure, which would be more bothersome in a less engaging film.  There is a lot of crying, for example, but the actors themselves laugh about this excess in the commentary track.  On a purely physical level, one could wish for Billy to take his shirt off at least once, considering the look of his arms and chest in his tight T-shirt!But the sincerity, skill, and earnestness of the actors overrides any flaws.

Now I consider myself The Grinch, but even my heart couldn't bear the weight of the sincerity of this film and the resolve of the characters in it.  It's a study in hope and love and faith in family and each other.Two boyhood friends, both clearly in love with the other, go their separate ways in adulthood, fearing how the other would feel about their gay feelings.  Through a set of tragic circumstances, both are thrust back together, some time later, along with a mentally challenged sibling, to finally express their love and try to form a family.This film is definitely not for everybody.  I can understand some viewers' diappointment.  I wasn't disappointed.

Rognlien,"[30, 34]","Yes, it has flaws - a little talky, a little heavy on the crying - but at the core of this film is a sweetness and a sincerity that is hard for even the most jaded among us to resist completely.While it's no Brokeback Mountain, the acting is decent enough (the eyes on Mr. Kerr are quite distracting) and the story easy enough to relate to.  I applaud filmmakers who are trying to take gay cinema more into the real and the relevant; not every film has to have a diva soundtrack, a throng of muscle clones or a revalation about what it means to be gay.  Ultimately, our lives, our hopes and our fears are the same - love, loss, family and the pursuit of happiness.  While it doesn't dive deep into any of these topics, it touches on them just enough to make the 71-minutes journey well worth the investment, and one you may want to repeat from time to time, whenever you need a reminder that it's the little things - and those closest to us - that hold the keys to happiness in life.. everything else is icing.",4,Adorable,1141084800,"02 28, 2006",2006,1010,"['Yes', 'flaws', 'little', 'talky', 'little', 'heavy', 'crying', 'core', 'film', 'sweetness', 'sincerity', 'hard', 'even', 'most', 'jaded', 'resist', 'completely.While', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'acting', 'decent', 'enough', 'eyes', 'Mr.', 'Kerr', 'are', 'quite', 'distracting', 'story', 'easy', 'enough', 'relate', 'applaud', 'filmmakers', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'take', 'gay', 'cinema', 'more', 'real', 'relevant', 'not', 'film', 'have', 'diva', 'soundtrack', 'throng', 'muscle', 'clones', 'revalation', 'what', 'be', 'gay', 'Ultimately', 'lives', 'hopes', 'fears', 'are', 'same', 'love', 'loss', 'family', 'pursuit', 'happiness', ""n't"", 'dive', 'deep', 'topics', 'just', 'enough', 'make', '71-minutes', 'journey', 'well', 'investment', 'one', 'may', 'want', 'repeat', 'time', 'time', 'whenever', 'need', 'reminder', 'little', 'things', 'closest', 'hold', 'keys', 'happiness', 'life..', 'everything', 'else', 'icing']",Regarding Billy

Quite honestly, a lot of them really are not very good. But I have to say that I enjoyed ""Regarding Billy"" more so than about 80% of the similarly-themed independent films I've seen.Oh, no doubt about it, this is a sentimental tear-jerker sort of story. Think of a very small-scale Lifetime made-for-television film, with a gay twist. But hey, I tend to be a sentimental kind of guy, and sometimes I really am in the mood for just such a picture. And this one fit the bill admirably. It's not perfect, but it really did engage me on an emotional level.I do wish that the relationship between the two leads was explored in more depth; they were an appealing couple and had great chemistry together, and I simply wanted to see more interaction between them. Perhaps that is the greatest drawback of this film; with its modest running time, it seems rather like a sketch of a story---lightly drawn, just waiting to be made into a two-hour feature. There are a lot of interesting ideas here waiting to be more thoroughly explored. But taken on its own modest terms, I can say that I really did enjoy this picture. (I would REALLY have liked to see a bit more snogging between the two leads, however, that is certain! As I said, they were an appealing pair.)The DVD contains a handful of outtakes, a couple of which are quite funny. And the commentary track, with the director and three actors, is a lot of fun (despite a couple of silent spots early on). It's just those four guys in a room, laughing around and joking and having a good time while talking about the film. (It cracked me up, when they themselves were laughing about how many doe-eyed, teary reaction shots the lead character had to give.)

Sure I knew the characters were going  to get together, but so what?  I found myself rooting for them and knew the secret would be revealed at the right time.2.  This film did not need a bigger budget.  It was intimate, warm, and the camera work and cinimatography splendid.3.  The acting was excellent.  The two leads were totally believable and I felt the characters bond from the very beginning of the film.4.  I did not feel there were too many weepy moments.  These were pretty strong themes and emotions the characters were going through, and I felt their pain and joy.5.  I do have to agree about one point.  I was sure after the confession they would be making love in front of the fireplace. But they just held on to each other devulging more sweet sentiment.  That is still alright with me.As far as gay themed love story films, I have to rate this one up there with Shelter, Beautiful Thing, and Big Eden.  It made me feel good.

Even if one of the buddies is gay, his feelings are very much hidden and never shared with the other. Many gay coming out movies seem to dwell on this theme.Ronnie Kerr plays Billy, the wholesome cute boy; Jack Sway, plays very convincingly Johnny, Billy's mentally retarded brother; and Jason Van Eman, plays Dean, the masculine tough guy who goes off to the military (I am guessing because he does not want to confront his feelings for Billy).Billy and Johnny's parents died and Dean returns from the military who moves in with them. Dean is going blind due to an injury in the battlefield.Regarding Billy is unique in that both guys are gay, have feelings for each other, and act as straight guys. The movie ends with both, Billy and Dean telling each other the truth about each other. There is one kissing scene, some hugging and that is it.
