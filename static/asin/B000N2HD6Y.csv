The 1st story isn't funny, scary or clever at all; just a tad cute and over long. The 2nd story is the best (about a lonely security guard who takes orders from his clock-radio, but not as well as he should.) 3rd about a killer prostitute is fun and creepy too. 4th is really campy (about a professor and his seemingly robotic wife) but not too funny, especially the ending. Last tale about an unethical doctor put me to sleep as it seemed to be going nowhere.Yes, this is amateur and bites the Creepshow name to gain an audience. Overall, the good stories have the right amount of humor and horror and mystery. The bad ones are mostly pointless, over indulgent and really boring. The bookending character (not an actual story involving him) of the hot dog vendor is just gory and silly and reminds me how this movie did not follow the rhythm of any of the previous Creepshows or create one of it's own other than 5 stories strung together with no bridges and the aforementioned character bookending it.",2,2 Stars For 2 Pretty OK Tales,1306195200,"05 24, 2011",2011,1094,"['unofficial', 'sequel', ""n't"", 'have', 'too', 'much', 'going', ""n't"", 'absolutely', 'horrid', '1st', 'story', ""n't"", 'funny', 'scary', 'clever', 'just', 'tad', 'cute', 'long', '2nd', 'story', 'best', 'lonely', 'security', 'guard', 'who', 'orders', 'clock-radio', 'not', 'as', 'well', 'should', '3rd', 'killer', 'prostitute', 'fun', 'creepy', 'too', '4th', 'really', 'campy', 'professor', 'seemingly', 'robotic', 'wife', 'not', 'too', 'funny', 'especially', 'ending', 'Last', 'tale', 'unethical', 'doctor', 'put', 'sleep', 'seemed', 'be', 'going', 'nowhere.Yes', 'amateur', 'Creepshow', 'name', 'gain', 'audience', 'Overall', 'good', 'stories', 'have', 'right', 'amount', 'humor', 'horror', 'mystery', 'bad', 'ones', 'are', 'mostly', 'pointless', 'indulgent', 'really', 'boring', 'bookending', 'character', 'not', 'actual', 'story', 'involving', 'hot', 'dog', 'vendor', 'just', 'gory', 'silly', 'how', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'follow', 'rhythm', 'previous', 'Creepshows', 'create', 'one', 'own', 'other', '5', 'stories', 'strung', 'together', 'bridges', 'aforementioned', 'character', 'bookending']","Creepshow III: Tales of Murder, Mayhem and Madness"

It is an unofficial sequel and, in no way, is involved with with the director, writer or production crew of any of the previous films. The film, as the original, consists of five new tales of light-hearted horror. They are:""Alice"", ""The Radio"", ""Call Girl"", ""The Professor's Wife"" & ""Haunted Dog"" with the EC Comics angle omitted this time around. ""Creepshow III"" takes the approach very similar to Quentin Tarantino's 1994 crime epic, ""Pulp Fiction"", in which characters from every story collide with one-another throughout the film. In this respect, it just doesn't feel like a ""Creepshow"" movie.Standing alone, Creepshow III is decent enough for a movie but not up to the calibur set by George Romero and Stephen King. Taurus Entertainment have already announced another 'unofficial' sequel entitled ""Creepshow IV"", currently slated to go into production February of 2008. If you can get this in a bargain bin as well, by all means get it but don't pay full price for it. I can't recommend it otherwise.I honestly don't see why some companies feel the need to continue franchises like these without the original crews input in some way.

The film begins with the story of Alice (Stephanie Pettee), a teenager who finds out that the new universal remote control her father has is literally universal. It has strange powers and abilities to manipulate her surroundings but this newly discovered power spins out of control. The next story involves a part-time security guard named Jerry (A. J. Bowen), who lives in a nasty apartment building on the wrong side of town. When his radio breaks, he buys a new one for cheap off of a local homeless man. This radio somehow interacts with him and talks instead of broadcasting stations. He begins following the advice of the sultry voiced radio, but are the radio's commands going to help Jerry or lead him to his grave? The next story involves a reserved, even dorky man named Victor who meets a call girl Rachel, who is actually the notorious serial killer wanted by the police. This femme fatale soon discovers Victor is unlike most men as he has a monstrous secret. The next story involves two former students of a researcher named Professor Dayton who pay him a visit as he is soon planning on marrying his fiance. It turns out his fiance acts in a bizarre fashion and they suspect her of being a robot. The final story involves a vulgar and cruel doctor who works at a free clinic. He inadvertently kills a homeless man as he gives him a hazardous hot dog he dropped onto the sidewalk. This man's ghost visits the not-so good doctor.This movie is poorly conceived and executed and it shows. The stories either stink from beginning to end or end up going nowhere. To be fair, I think the second story about the radio with sapience actually has a solid plot and is a decent segment; it might have even made a good movie on its own.

With all that said, CREEPSHOW 3 was slightly better than I expected it to be.  It has a few decent moments (very few) but mostly the stories are incredibly stupid, poorly written and atrociously acted and directed.  Oddly, I didn't mind the animated portion of the film that everyone else is complaining about, and for all of it's obvious lack of budget, I thought the film itself looked okay.  There were a couple of decent gore effects as well, and the Call Girl/Vampire story was actually enjoyable (for me at least).  I also thought that the music score by Chris Anderson was acceptable (although not anywhere close to the scores composed by John Harrison, Rick Wakeman etc.).  CREEPSHOW 3  ends with the single worst CGI animation effect I have ever seen in a movie.  It looked like something I might come up with on my own computer after about five minutes of work.What Taurus Entertainment and Dudelson and Clavell are doing with these rip-off sequals is simply obscene and should not be encouraged.  I bought my copy of CREEPSHOW 3 used simply so they wouldn't see a dime of my money.  I'm still holding a grudge from DAY OF THE DEAD 2.  They should truly be ashamed of themselves for bringing this blight into a wonderful little horror anthology series.  Of course the first two CREEPSHOW films still remain great classics, but it is so sad that CREEPSHOW 3 exists to put such a stigma on the series.  I see that a CREEPSHOW 4 is scheduled to shoot this year.  Let us hope that it can rise above the disaster that is CREEPSHOW 3.  Still, credit should be given where credit is due and not everything in this film is without merit.  The vampire sequence is pretty good, some of the gore effects are nice, the ""radio"" sequence isn't a complete failure but it goes on for far too long, the music score is decent and the film looks nice and bright with a few decent edits as well.  It isn't a complete failure, just an almost complete failure.",2,Stop Dudelson and Clavell,1207958400,"04 12, 2008",2008,2315,"['did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'going', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'James', 'Dudelson', 'Ana', 'Clavell', 'filthy', 'uninspired', 'hacks', 'who', 'somehow', 'got', 'hands', 'lot', 'George', 'Romero', 'properties', 'produced', 'unspeakbly', 'awful', 'DAY', 'THE', 'DEAD', '2', 'two', 'individuals', 'should', 'be', 'stopped', 'direct', 'again', 'are', 'as', 'talentless', 'are', 'physically', 'ugly', 'said', 'CREEPSHOW', '3', 'was', 'slightly', 'better', 'expected', 'be', 'few', 'decent', 'moments', 'very', 'few', 'mostly', 'stories', 'are', 'incredibly', 'stupid', 'poorly', 'written', 'atrociously', 'acted', 'directed', 'Oddly', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'animated', 'portion', 'film', 'everyone', 'else', 'complaining', 'obvious', 'lack', 'budget', 'thought', 'film', 'looked', 'okay', 'were', 'couple', 'decent', 'gore', 'effects', 'as', 'well', 'Call', 'Girl/Vampire', 'story', 'was', 'actually', 'enjoyable', 'least', 'also', 'thought', 'music', 'score', 'Chris', 'Anderson', 'was', 'acceptable', 'not', 'anywhere', 'close', 'scores', 'composed', 'John', 'Harrison', 'Rick', 'Wakeman', 'etc.', '3', 'ends', 'single', 'worst', 'CGI', 'animation', 'effect', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'looked', 'something', 'might', 'come', 'up', 'own', 'computer', 'five', 'minutes', 'work.What', 'Taurus', 'Entertainment', 'Dudelson', 'Clavell', 'are', 'doing', 'rip-off', 'sequals', 'simply', 'obscene', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'encouraged', 'bought', 'copy', 'CREEPSHOW', '3', 'used', 'simply', 'would', ""n't"", 'see', 'dime', 'money', ""'m"", 'still', 'holding', 'grudge', 'DAY', 'THE', 'DEAD', '2', 'should', 'truly', 'be', 'ashamed', 'bringing', 'blight', 'wonderful', 'little', 'horror', 'anthology', 'series', 'course', 'first', 'two', 'CREEPSHOW', 'films', 'still', 'remain', 'great', 'classics', 'so', 'sad', 'CREEPSHOW', '3', 'put', 'stigma', 'series', 'see', 'CREEPSHOW', '4', 'scheduled', 'shoot', 'year', 'Let', 'hope', 'can', 'rise', 'disaster', 'CREEPSHOW', '3', 'Still', 'credit', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'where', 'credit', 'due', 'not', 'everything', 'film', 'merit', 'vampire', 'sequence', 'pretty', 'good', 'gore', 'effects', 'are', 'nice', 'radio', 'sequence', ""n't"", 'complete', 'failure', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'music', 'score', 'decent', 'film', 'nice', 'bright', 'few', 'decent', 'edits', 'as', 'well', ""n't"", 'complete', 'failure', 'just', 'almost', 'complete', 'failure']","Creepshow III: Tales of Murder, Mayhem and Madness"

1052252,A2GBBDNZLYC4A9,B000N2HD6Y,"Jeff Johnson ""Jeff Johnson""","[1, 1]","I grew up on Creepshow 1, which was 5 brief tales written by Steven King that threw you back to the horror comic book days. There was great suspense, erie 80s synth music, wild characters and creepy circumstnaces. Then the second movie had 3 tales of terror, written by King, but kind of dropped the horror comic book creepiness.Well this movie throws creepy out the door and replaces it with corny and craziness. There are five tales that bait you in predictable ways then swerve you. They really bluntly lead you to believe the obvious. Instead of dropping hints they basically tell you what will happen... so they can swerve you and have something else happen that is still predictable. You may take note Steven King is no where to be found in the writing credits for this movie.STORY 1 >> ALICE: This made no sense really. A girl wishes she were someplace else and her dad is playing with a remote that changes the family to different ethnicities. Then for no reason it changes her... This made no sense and it felt very twightlight zone and not very creepshow. Especially since it was all done on a bright and sunny day. This is thankfully kept brief.STORY 2 >> THE RADIO: I actually liked this. A radio tells a man what to do. That's all I'll say. This felt like it dragged on a bit too long in the middle.STORY 3 >> THE CALL GIRL: Uggg... This was predictable, because they bluntly lead you to think something would happen so something totally different could happen. I guess this was Creepshow-ish, but meh.STORY 4 >> THE PROFESSOR'S WIFE: No one can believe the old professor has a hot wife. Really? This is another tale that bluntly leads you to believe something. So blunt that you know there will be a twist... a predictable twist. This would count as comedy in most movies.STORY 5 >> THE HAUNTED DOG >> This is a great character piece. If anyone wants to know how to be a jerk, watch this tale of a doctor... a jerk of a doctor that lets a man die on the street. The creepiness factor was a 0.1 out of 100. The special effect of the bum's ghost was lame.Where this movie stands out from any other is that all 5 of these stories exist in the same world, the same town at the same time. A character will appear in another story here and there. In all the movie seems low budget, not enough gore or creepiness to call itself Creepshow.For me, the music really killed it. There was corny and silly music in the background of 90% of the movie instead of creepy music that made the first one so good. Also a lot of this movie takes place in the day. Why is that a complaint? Because the majority of Creepshow 1 and 2 were at night and it adds to the creepiness. Like you can either have a creepy killer in a rainstorm or you can have him out on a sunny day. You pick which one you'd rather see.Overall, skip this movie and go see Creepshow 1 or if you've seen that dozens of times, seek out Creepshow 2 or Trilogy of Terror.",2,Not nearly as good as the first or even the second and can be considered a low budget movie with a big budget name,1334534400,"04 16, 2012",2012,2931,"['grew', 'up', 'Creepshow', '1', 'was', '5', 'brief', 'tales', 'written', 'Steven', 'King', 'threw', 'back', 'horror', 'comic', 'book', 'days', 'was', 'great', 'suspense', '80s', 'synth', 'music', 'wild', 'characters', 'creepy', 'circumstnaces', 'Then', 'second', 'movie', 'had', '3', 'tales', 'terror', 'written', 'King', 'kind', 'dropped', 'horror', 'comic', 'book', 'creepiness.Well', 'movie', 'out', 'door', 'replaces', 'corny', 'craziness', 'are', 'five', 'tales', 'bait', 'predictable', 'ways', 'then', 'swerve', 'really', 'bluntly', 'lead', 'believe', 'obvious', 'Instead', 'dropping', 'hints', 'basically', 'tell', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'can', 'swerve', 'have', 'something', 'else', 'happen', 'still', 'predictable', 'may', 'take', 'note', 'Steven', 'King', 'where', 'be', 'found', 'writing', 'credits', 'movie.STORY', '1', '>', '>', 'ALICE', 'made', 'sense', 'really', 'girl', 'were', 'someplace', 'else', 'dad', 'playing', 'remote', 'family', 'different', 'ethnicities', 'Then', 'reason', 'made', 'sense', 'felt', 'very', 'twightlight', 'zone', 'not', 'very', 'creepshow', 'Especially', 'was', 'done', 'bright', 'sunny', 'day', 'thankfully', 'kept', 'brief.STORY', '2', '>', '>', 'THE', 'RADIO', 'actually', 'liked', 'radio', 'man', 'what', 'do', ""'ll"", 'say', 'felt', 'dragged', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'middle.STORY', '3', '>', '>', 'THE', 'CALL', 'GIRL', 'Uggg', 'was', 'predictable', 'bluntly', 'lead', 'think', 'something', 'would', 'happen', 'so', 'something', 'totally', 'different', 'could', 'happen', 'guess', 'was', 'Creepshow-ish', '4', '>', '>', 'THE', 'PROFESSOR', 'WIFE', 'one', 'can', 'believe', 'old', 'professor', 'hot', 'wife', 'Really', 'tale', 'bluntly', 'believe', 'something', 'So', 'blunt', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'twist', 'predictable', 'twist', 'would', 'count', 'comedy', 'most', 'movies.STORY', '5', '>', '>', 'THE', 'HAUNTED', 'DOG', '>', '>', 'great', 'character', 'piece', 'anyone', 'know', 'how', 'be', 'jerk', 'watch', 'tale', 'doctor', 'jerk', 'doctor', 'man', 'die', 'street', 'creepiness', 'factor', 'was', '0.1', '100', 'special', 'effect', 'bum', 'ghost', 'was', 'lame.Where', 'movie', 'out', 'other', '5', 'stories', 'exist', 'same', 'world', 'same', 'town', 'same', 'time', 'character', 'will', 'appear', 'story', 'here', 'there', 'movie', 'low', 'budget', 'not', 'enough', 'gore', 'creepiness', 'call', 'Creepshow.For', 'music', 'really', 'killed', 'was', 'corny', 'silly', 'music', 'background', '90', '%', 'movie', 'instead', 'creepy', 'music', 'made', 'first', 'one', 'so', 'good', 'Also', 'lot', 'movie', 'place', 'day', 'Why', 'complaint', 'majority', 'Creepshow', '1', '2', 'were', 'night', 'creepiness', 'can', 'either', 'have', 'creepy', 'killer', 'rainstorm', 'can', 'have', 'out', 'sunny', 'day', 'pick', 'one', ""'d"", 'rather', 'see.Overall', 'skip', 'movie', 'go', 'see', 'Creepshow', '1', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'dozens', 'times', 'seek', 'out', 'Creepshow', '2', 'Trilogy', 'Terror']","Creepshow III: Tales of Murder, Mayhem and Madness"

Her father then presses the remote control, and she is zapped to some other place where the family is black and having the same conversation. Then the same thing happens again with the black family. Then the same thing again with a Hispanic family. With the remote control of the Hispanic family, she becomes infested with some sort of sickness. Then a worse sickness. And then she finally is turned into a rabbit by the Weird Professor Next Door. RATING: WTF?2. A man lives in a roach roost housing project and finds a radio that talks to him. It tells him where to find some money and then to kill a bunch of people. Eventually, he defies the radio and is killed by a man who was set on to him by the same radio voice that made the him kill the other characters. RATING: Moderately interesting.3.

Uh, ahem, I was wrong.Instead of an anthology of horror or creepiness, this movie just tries to be weird.  And it does a bang-up job of it.  The first two films tied their stories together with the theme of thecomic book.  This flick, however, tries to mush the stories together like ingredients in a gumbo.  If you pay close enough attention, you'll see bits and pieces of each story threading into each other.  Some of the clues and hints are even remarkably detailed and (in a few cases) hard to catch.But just because a puzzle is complicated doesn't make it good.  The makers of CREEPSHOW III didn't know how to do scary, so they just went with bizarre.  Here, as best as possible, are the various stories of this installment:""Alice"" -- The most incomprehensible, stupid, and poorly acted segment of the bunch.  In fact, it's amazing just how awful every aspect of this story is: the filming, directing, dialogue.  Ostensibly about a Universal Remote that ""controls everything,"" this part of the movie is well worth the time it would take to fast-forward through it.  Can't believe this was ever filmed.""The Radio"" -- Lame-wad Jerry purchases a radio that is unnaturally concerned with his future well-being.  Interesting idea is ruined by dull plotting and an ending that makes some sense if you choose to twist your mind around it, but which is unrewarding and lame no matter how you look at it.  Features one of the most obnoxious street vendors I've ever seen on film.""Call Girl"" -- A smug serial-killer prostitute meets up with a handsome client who is his own kind of dangerous.  Neat idea, but suffers from a case of, well, let's just say this segment doesn't have enough foreplay.""The Professor's Wife"" -- One of the main characters to provide the movie with its connective tissue is the ""brilliant"" professor, who has invited some young graduates to his home to meet his fiance, a young but seemingly clueless (and gorgeous) blonde.  Is she for real?  Or is she just another of the professor's experiments?  Say hello to the most violent and yet dumbest (and silliest) of this film's stories.""Haunted Dog"" -- In every one of these movies there's been a story about an inadvertent death, followed by a persistent haunting.  This version follows around the crass and selfish Dr. Farwell.  I think Farwell's  insensitivity and his pathetic bedside manner are meant to be funny, but it's tired and uninspired.

The twist on the end made for a bit of gore, but I'm afraid they would have to cut out the coolest looking part of the movie, as well as all the un-needed cuss-words in it, to make it the perfect PG rated episode of Tales From The Crypt.Then there is the hooker killer who gets her own from Baraka or whatever he is supposed to be. PG rated at most.Then the weirdo scientists friend hacking up his bride to be, not only is it PG, it could probably work for the kind of comedy you would expect from say, ""Penn & Teller""Then there is the Doctor you love to hate, and well... couldn't they have come up with something better... just a little bit better?... it was kind of funny watching his montage showing what a jerk he is to patients, but the delve into insanity was mediocre at most.Overall, the only good things I say about it, the stories each tied into each other OK, yet, intentionally so not cleverly. I suppose none of it was boring, but the stories would end before they seemed to have begun, and I guess the image and effects aren't that bad.It's the bad acting and script writing that make this movie fail. Nothing is scary or intense, and if they cut out a few words here and there and trimmed a bit of the low budget gore in a couple of areas, these would be a kids show like Goosebumps kind of thing, at most.To give you an idea of this, Creep Show III makes Freddy's Nightmares look like pure gold entertainment.Special Features: Who Cares.",2,"Cut out certain parts and dialog, and aim for kids horror shows with this",1213401600,"06 14, 2008",2008,2104,"['came', 'up', 'idea', 'really', 'torn', 'what', 'horror', 'what', 'episode', 'Goosebumps', 'would', 'be', 'foul', 'language', 'was', 'be', 'included.The', 'first', 'tale', 'was', 'far', 'scary', 'yet', 'far', 'horror', 'same', 'time', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'rated', 'PG', 'laughed', '8', 'year', 'talking', 'radio', 'gag', 'Sorry', 'acting', 'reality', 'just', 'take', 'away', 'plot', 'thing', 'radio', 'talks', 'going', 'help', 'be', 'rich', 'not', 'question', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'prank', 'someone', 'CB', 'radio', 'just', 'start', 'real', 'sorry', 'i', 'could', 'not', 'see', 'ignore', 'twist', 'end', 'made', 'bit', 'gore', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'would', 'have', 'cut', 'out', 'coolest', 'looking', 'part', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'un-needed', 'cuss-words', 'make', 'perfect', 'PG', 'rated', 'episode', 'Tales', 'Crypt.Then', 'hooker', 'killer', 'who', 'own', 'Baraka', 'supposed', 'be', 'PG', 'rated', 'most.Then', 'weirdo', 'scientists', 'friend', 'hacking', 'up', 'bride', 'be', 'not', 'only', 'PG', 'could', 'probably', 'work', 'kind', 'comedy', 'would', 'expect', 'say', 'Penn', 'Teller', 'Then', 'Doctor', 'love', 'hate', 'well', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'come', 'up', 'something', 'better', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'better', 'was', 'kind', 'funny', 'watching', 'montage', 'showing', 'what', 'jerk', 'patients', 'delve', 'insanity', 'was', 'mediocre', 'most.Overall', 'only', 'good', 'things', 'say', 'stories', 'tied', 'other', 'OK', 'yet', 'intentionally', 'so', 'not', 'cleverly', 'suppose', 'none', 'was', 'boring', 'stories', 'would', 'end', 'seemed', 'have', 'begun', 'guess', 'image', 'effects', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad.It', 'bad', 'acting', 'script', 'writing', 'make', 'movie', 'fail', 'Nothing', 'scary', 'intense', 'cut', 'out', 'few', 'words', 'here', 'there', 'trimmed', 'bit', 'low', 'budget', 'gore', 'couple', 'areas', 'would', 'be', 'kids', 'show', 'Goosebumps', 'kind', 'thing', 'most.To', 'give', 'idea', 'Creep', 'Show', 'III', 'Freddy', 'Nightmares', 'look', 'pure', 'gold', 'entertainment.Special', 'Features', 'Who']","Creepshow III: Tales of Murder, Mayhem and Madness"

Naturally, it spawned a sequel that ultimately failed to live up to the original, but it was nowhere near as bad as what we have here.  Creepshow 3 is the third entry in the series in name only, as it is brought to us by the same crew that brought us the direct to DVD Day of the Dead 2: Contagium.  Reading the previous sentence alone will tell you everything you need to know about Creepshow 3 in regards to checking it out, which if you were lucky enough not to see Day of the Dead 2, you should avoid this as well.  The only thing Creepshow 3 really has in common with the previous films are by featuring multiple stories that get tied together, along with some lame CGI-rendered comic book style frames here and there as well.  The acting throughout is horrible beyond belief, and saying that the stories themselves are lame is saying it lightly.  The gore effects stink, and the tepid, uninspired direction makes a guy like Uwe Boll look like Martin Scorsese.  Yes, it's that bad, and like Day of the Dead 2 before it, it's completely unnecessary as well.

Some pretty good ideas that could be made into something with a lot of work and polish, but instead it was just shot without the rewrite.  Quick example with the first short story.  Why does the remote change her family?  Maybe I can get by without an explanation.  Why does it change her then?  Why did the crazy guy change her?  Why did he give the remote to her parents?  They try to set the girl up as spoiled, so maybe he didn't like her.  They never showed her being mean to him, so it is not well set up to why he would do this, and what is the ultimate point.

However, ""Creepshow III"" is a sequel IN NAME ONLY to those first two films and lacks the involvement of both Stephen King and George A. Romero, both of whom made the first two films a success. ""Creepshow III"" is written and directed by nobodies and stars people you never heard of (except for Eileen Dietz - an actress whom only hardcore horror fans will recall as playing both ""Possessed Regan"" and ""The Face of Death"" from ""The Exorcist"" film.) As is typically associated with films of low-budget horror, the script is incoherent and the acting is wildly terrible and ""Creepshow III"" manages to deliver these traits in spades.

The sense of being underwhelmed permeates from this film at every possible point and you actually have to wonder why either King or Romero haven't begun legal action to remove this film from the collective conscience.If you're one of those fans of horror who actually enjoy terrible movies, this movie still isn't up your alley. It's a total waste of time. I was an idiot and bought it when I found out about it (since none of the video stores in my area carried it - which should have been my first clue because they'll carry any piece of crap horror movie). Literally, after watching it, I couldn't wait to have it out of my house and I immediately sold it to a resale shop (where, undoubtedly, some other poor sucker picked it up and hoped against all hope that it would be like the other two.)For your own sake and sanity, do not buy this movie. Do not give these people money. Do not soil your fond (or whatever they may be) memories of Creepshow's 1 & 2. Do not endorse even more crappy, low-budget tales of cliched horror. Do not buy this movie just to have a laugh with your friends (because your friends will hate you and renounce their friendship with you.) Do not be fooled by the comic book cover thinking it has anything to do with the prior films.Avoid this movie and, if you happen to be one of the persons involved in any way, shape or form with the making of this film: punch yourself in the face... really hard... and just keep on punching until you realize what you did. Then, punch yourself (really hard) some more so you never do this again because you are a terrible person.Thank you.",1,"""Creepshow III"" - or - ""Low Budget Tales of Cliched Horror""",1245456000,"06 20, 2009",2009,2742,"['Quite', 'honestly', ""'re"", 'looking', 'up', 'film', 'only', 'have', 'fond', 'memories', 'first', 'two', 'Creepshow', 'films', 'However', 'Creepshow', 'III', 'sequel', 'IN', 'NAME', 'ONLY', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'involvement', 'Stephen', 'King', 'George', 'A.', 'Romero', 'whom', 'made', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'success', 'Creepshow', 'III', 'written', 'directed', 'nobodies', 'stars', 'people', 'never', 'heard', 'Eileen', 'Dietz', 'actress', 'whom', 'only', 'hardcore', 'horror', 'fans', 'will', 'recall', 'playing', 'Possessed', 'Regan', 'Face', 'Death', 'Exorcist', 'film', 'typically', 'associated', 'films', 'low-budget', 'horror', 'script', 'incoherent', 'acting', 'wildly', 'terrible', 'Creepshow', 'III', 'deliver', 'traits', 'spades', 'film', ""n't"", 'even', 'realm', ""so-bad-it's-good"", 'variety', 'so-bad-you-wonder-who-could-have-possibly-funded-this-turd', 'category', 'could', 'discuss', 'vignettes', 'pass', 'bulk', 'film', 'really', 'why', 'bother', 'stories', 'are', 'so', 'cliched', 'poorly', 'written', 'completely', 'devoid', 'shock', 'horror', 'chills', 'competency', 'even', 'basic', 'explanation', 'sense', 'being', 'underwhelmed', 'permeates', 'film', 'possible', 'point', 'actually', 'have', 'wonder', 'why', 'King', 'Romero', 'have', ""n't"", 'begun', 'legal', 'action', 'remove', 'film', 'collective', 'conscience.If', ""'re"", 'one', 'fans', 'horror', 'who', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'terrible', 'movies', 'movie', 'still', ""n't"", 'up', 'alley', 'total', 'waste', 'time', 'was', 'idiot', 'bought', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'none', 'video', 'stores', 'area', 'carried', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'first', 'clue', ""'ll"", 'carry', 'piece', 'crap', 'horror', 'movie', 'Literally', 'watching', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'have', 'house', 'immediately', 'sold', 'resale', 'shop', 'where', 'undoubtedly', 'other', 'poor', 'sucker', 'picked', 'up', 'hoped', 'hope', 'would', 'be', 'other', 'two', 'own', 'sake', 'sanity', 'do', 'not', 'buy', 'movie', 'Do', 'not', 'give', 'people', 'money', 'Do', 'not', 'soil', 'fond', 'may', 'be', 'memories', 'Creepshow', '1', '2', 'Do', 'not', 'endorse', 'even', 'more', 'crappy', 'low-budget', 'tales', 'cliched', 'horror', 'Do', 'not', 'buy', 'movie', 'just', 'have', 'laugh', 'friends', 'friends', 'will', 'hate', 'renounce', 'friendship', 'Do', 'not', 'be', 'fooled', 'comic', 'book', 'cover', 'thinking', 'anything', 'do', 'prior', 'films.Avoid', 'movie', 'happen', 'be', 'one', 'persons', 'involved', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'making', 'film', 'punch', 'face', 'really', 'hard', 'just', 'keep', 'punching', 'realize', 'what', 'did', 'Then', 'punch', 'really', 'hard', 'more', 'so', 'never', 'do', 'again', 'are', 'terrible', 'person.Thank']","Creepshow III: Tales of Murder, Mayhem and Madness"
