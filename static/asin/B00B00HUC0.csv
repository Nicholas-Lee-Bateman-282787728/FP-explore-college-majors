1620603,A2IYTNAMLR5TJR,B00B00HUC0,Don McGregor,"[17, 18]","Warners has two divisions releasing DVDs and Blu-Rays, and sometimes it's like a Maverick gamble trying to figure out which release is coming from which section.Maverick, Season 2 on DVD has apparently a broader appeal than, say, Cheyenne, which is another Warners Western series from the 1950s into the '60s. Cheyenne is released through their Warner Archives; Maverick through Warner Bros. Home Entertainment Group. I think I have that right. I screwed it up once in writing to them, so we'll see.Both shows are from their library of TV series that brought Warner Bros. into the television arena. Shows like Maverick and 77 Sunset Strip were major league hits for the third network, ABC, at the time, and those shows, along with Walt Disney, helped make them a contender against NBC and CBS.Season 2 of Maverick is the series at the top of their game. The distinctive tone of Maverick is more clearly defined than in Season 1. If Cheyenne played by Clint Walker is the iconic, soft-voiced, Gary Cooper film persona of the cowboy of integrity and loyalty, the Maverick brothers are essentially Cheyenne's opposite; they are gamblers, their only real religion is the luck of the draw or outmaneuvering those that would cheat them. There are no better examples of this than in this newest set, packaged nicely, with good cover art of Bret and Bart with cards and chips in their hands.Maverick, Season 2 has all 26 episodes, the story telling uncut, selling at a reasonable price.(Side question: How did they get away with 26 episodes when most TV series at the time were producing a staggering number 39. 2nd side question: If they were going to do 39, how'd they come up with that number, why not an even 40?)You can read the entire piece up on COMICS BULLETIN in my RIDING SHOTGUN piece here:http://www.comicsbulletin.com/columns/5728/before-they-slaughtered-mavericks-wholesale/With a number of photos to go along with it.Let them know you were there, because they want to be more than just comics.Or let me know your thoughts here on Amazon.Hang in there!Don",5,BEFORE THEY SLAUGHTERED MAVERICKS WHOLESALE,1369180800,"05 22, 2013",2013,2061,"['Warners', 'two', 'divisions', 'releasing', 'DVDs', 'Blu-Rays', 'Maverick', 'gamble', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'release', 'coming', 'section.Maverick', 'Season', '2', 'DVD', 'apparently', 'broader', 'appeal', 'say', 'Cheyenne', 'Warners', 'Western', 'series', '1950s', ""'60s"", 'Cheyenne', 'released', 'Warner', 'Archives', 'Maverick', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'Home', 'Entertainment', 'Group', 'think', 'have', 'right', 'screwed', 'up', 'once', 'writing', ""'ll"", 'see.Both', 'shows', 'are', 'library', 'TV', 'series', 'brought', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'television', 'arena', 'Maverick', '77', 'Sunset', 'Strip', 'were', 'major', 'league', 'hits', 'third', 'network', 'ABC', 'time', 'shows', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'helped', 'make', 'contender', 'NBC', 'CBS.Season', '2', 'Maverick', 'series', 'top', 'game', 'distinctive', 'tone', 'Maverick', 'more', 'clearly', 'defined', 'Season', '1', 'Cheyenne', 'played', 'Clint', 'Walker', 'iconic', 'soft-voiced', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'film', 'persona', 'cowboy', 'integrity', 'loyalty', 'Maverick', 'brothers', 'are', 'essentially', 'Cheyenne', 'opposite', 'are', 'gamblers', 'only', 'real', 'religion', 'luck', 'draw', 'outmaneuvering', 'would', 'cheat', 'are', 'better', 'examples', 'newest', 'set', 'packaged', 'nicely', 'good', 'cover', 'art', 'Bret', 'Bart', 'cards', 'chips', 'hands.Maverick', 'Season', '2', '26', 'episodes', 'story', 'telling', 'uncut', 'selling', 'reasonable', 'price', 'Side', 'question', 'How', 'did', 'get', 'away', '26', 'episodes', 'when', 'most', 'TV', 'series', 'time', 'were', 'producing', 'staggering', 'number', '39', '2nd', 'side', 'question', 'were', 'going', 'do', '39', 'how', ""'d"", 'come', 'up', 'number', 'why', 'not', 'even', '40', 'can', 'read', 'entire', 'piece', 'up', 'COMICS', 'BULLETIN', 'RIDING', 'SHOTGUN', 'piece', 'here', 'http', '//www.comicsbulletin.com/columns/5728/before-they-slaughtered-mavericks-wholesale/With', 'number', 'photos', 'go', 'along', 'it.Let', 'know', 'were', 'there', 'want', 'be', 'more', 'just', 'comics.Or', 'let', 'know', 'thoughts', 'here', 'Amazon.Hang', 'there', 'Don']",Maverick: The Complete Season 2

I didn't remember anything about the episodes. I just remember that my father (now dead 24 years) and I really enjoyed them.A couple of months ago, I bought Season One on DVD. I started watching them and really enjoyed them. My wife, who hates Westerns, sat through an episode. I expected her to dislike it, but after one was over, she asked to see another. After that, she was hooked and we watched all 26 episodes together. I immediately ordered the Second Season and we spent a very pleasant 26 straight evenings, watching one episode each evening.She asked me to order Season 3 and was as disappointed as I am to find out that Season Three is not yet out. We watched a few of the best episodes over again, as we both went into withdrawal.Please, people at Warner Brothers, bring out Season Three.As for the Bret and Bart controversy, I thought in Season One, the vast majority of James Garner episodes were better than the Jack Kelley episodes, There were two or three good Kelly episodes towards the end of the Season. ""Savage Hills"" (episode 20 of Season One) with Diane Brewster as Samantha Crawford was Kelly's breakout episode. I felt he really started to relax and develop his own character in this episode.

1620619,ATP9LYGM6D3RO,B00B00HUC0,"McGillicutty ""DVD Fan""","[28, 28]","Not a moment too soon we are blessed with the second season of ""Maverick"", the full 26 episodes presented in glorious black and white.Starring James Garner as the always affable, sometimes scheming Bret Maverick in the role that made him famous. He appears even more comfortable this season and with the support of his trusting brother Bart, played with great aplomb by Jack Kelly, we get to enjoy some of the best episodes this vaunted series has to offer.Certainly one of my favorites and arguably a signature episode of the series is ""Shady Deal at Sunny Acres"" that features many of the series regulars who helped make ""Maverick"" so special. ""Shady Deal"" features a great set-up that is executed to perfection which would be mimicked by future TV shows and movies like ""The Sting"".Other highlights include a young pre-Rawhide Clint Eastwood in ""Duel at Sundown"" who keeps calling our hero mister ""Mav-er-AAACK"", ""The Day They Hanged Bret Maverick"" and ""The Spanish Dancer"" featuring Slim Pickens. However, all of the episodes are enjoyable to watch and vastly entertaining.As for the DVDs themselves, little has changed since the first series was released last year.

The overall video quality is also fair to good with noticeable wear and scratches present so like the first season I am docking this DVD set one star.

Even  our kids enjoy watching it.  But some things seem different.  Might be my memory of this decades-old show, but I have a pretty clear memory in the episode I noted below where the bad guy realizes that he's been had, goes to get Maverick off the stage coach only to find that yes, Maverick asked about the stage but actually took the train in the other direction, and there's this hilarious ""jackass music"";  In this DVD, no music, it seems like a different ending.  Again, memory can be wrong and that seems like the most likely explanation, I may be criss-crossing episodes, but it just doesn't seem that way.  Did the DVD use an alternate ending for some reason?  In any case, still highly recommended and just as good as expected, but a few things seem changed.  Probably just the passage of time.  I guess this is the way it starts...Video and audio quality are excellent, no problems.********************************************************************************************Note: This is an early review on concept, the DVD is pre-ordered and I have not yet received it.  Will update after. [Update above]The old Warner Brothers TV series, Maverick, was one of TV's best shows, and finally WB seems to have released it to DVD's after decades of waiting.  I see that the individual seasons are available and also the entire series.  In terms of me having time to actually view the whole series, which is unlikely, and in terms of cost (both the purchase price for the whole series plus getting a divorce since my wife would shoot me if I bought the entire series), I opted for the second season, which seems to have many of the most memorable, best episodes.  There's one where a banker cheats Bret Maverick out of late-night gambling winnings and how Bret gets it back while seemingly doing nothing, and the ""jackass music"" at the end when the crooked banker realizes that he's been had, well worth the DVD all by itself.  If folks remember some of the old, great Western TV shows like Gunsmoke, Have Gun - Will Travel, etc., there's a Maverick second season episode that satirizes them, and does a great job of it.  Everyone will have their favorite episodes, and some will want the whole season, but this second season has the strongest appeal for me.So, I'm looking forward to this in a few weeks.  When I receive and view it, I will update this.  Hopefully audio and visual quality will be good, etc.  But this was arguably the best season of a great show in the golden age of TV, so I can't wait!",5,Pre-review!,1365379200,"04 8, 2013",2013,2720,"['Comments', 'getting', 'DVD', 'rating', 'was', 'excellent', 'series', 'entertaining', 'done', 'well', 'timeless', 'not', 'cheesy', 'sophmoric', 'now', 'many', 'old', 'TV', 'shows', 'are', 'when', 'viewed', 'today', 'Even', 'kids', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'things', 'seem', 'different', 'Might', 'be', 'memory', 'decades-old', 'show', 'have', 'pretty', 'clear', 'memory', 'episode', 'noted', 'where', 'bad', 'guy', 'been', 'had', 'get', 'Maverick', 'off', 'stage', 'coach', 'only', 'find', 'yes', 'Maverick', 'asked', 'stage', 'actually', 'took', 'train', 'other', 'direction', 'hilarious', 'jackass', 'music', 'DVD', 'music', 'different', 'ending', 'Again', 'memory', 'can', 'be', 'wrong', 'most', 'likely', 'explanation', 'may', 'be', 'criss-crossing', 'episodes', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'way', 'Did', 'DVD', 'use', 'alternate', 'ending', 'reason', 'case', 'still', 'highly', 'recommended', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'expected', 'few', 'things', 'seem', 'changed', 'Probably', 'just', 'passage', 'time', 'guess', 'way', 'Video', 'audio', 'quality', 'are', 'excellent', 'problems', '********************************************************************************************Note', 'early', 'review', 'concept', 'DVD', 'pre-ordered', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'received', 'Will', 'update', '[', 'Update', ']', 'old', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'TV', 'series', 'Maverick', 'was', 'one', 'TV', 'best', 'shows', 'finally', 'WB', 'have', 'released', 'DVD', 'decades', 'waiting', 'see', 'individual', 'seasons', 'are', 'available', 'also', 'entire', 'series', 'terms', 'having', 'time', 'actually', 'view', 'whole', 'series', 'unlikely', 'terms', 'cost', 'purchase', 'price', 'whole', 'series', 'getting', 'divorce', 'wife', 'would', 'shoot', 'bought', 'entire', 'series', 'opted', 'second', 'season', 'have', 'many', 'most', 'memorable', 'best', 'episodes', 'one', 'where', 'banker', 'Bret', 'Maverick', 'late-night', 'gambling', 'winnings', 'how', 'Bret', 'back', 'seemingly', 'doing', 'nothing', 'jackass', 'music', 'end', 'when', 'crooked', 'banker', 'been', 'had', 'well', 'DVD', 'folks', 'remember', 'old', 'great', 'Western', 'TV', 'shows', 'Gunsmoke', 'Have', 'Gun', 'Will', 'Travel', 'etc.', 'Maverick', 'second', 'season', 'episode', 'great', 'job', 'Everyone', 'will', 'have', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'will', 'want', 'whole', 'season', 'second', 'season', 'strongest', 'appeal', 'me.So', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'few', 'weeks', 'When', 'receive', 'view', 'will', 'update', 'Hopefully', 'audio', 'visual', 'quality', 'will', 'be', 'good', 'etc', 'was', 'arguably', 'best', 'season', 'great', 'show', 'golden', 'age', 'TV', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait']",Maverick: The Complete Season 2
