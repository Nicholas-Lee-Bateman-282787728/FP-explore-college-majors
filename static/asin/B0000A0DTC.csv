760800,A1UI21TOBFCY86,B0000A0DTC,"Amazon Customer ""Mona0825""","[3, 3]","Reviewers have described the basics of this court drama. This is a very thought provoking piece, that will linger in your mind long after you are through it.I found myself thinking on Brothers Karamazov, the chapter of the ""Grand Inquisitor"". On this chapter, Ivan Karamazov is telling his younger brother the tale of the Grand Inquisitor: Jesus Christ returns to earth on XV century Spain; when he performs the miracle of resurrecting a child, the multitude is applauding him and then Inquisition arrest him for heresy. In his cell, the silent Jesus is confronted by the old Grand Inquisitor, who reproaches the Lord about placing an unbearable responsibility upon mankind: that of free will. Nothing is more attractive but more terrible to man that free will, meaning the choice -well, not only the choice, but the moral obligation- of discerning by oneself what is wrong and what is right. The Grand Inquisitor protests than only a few man and woman, the Saints, the Chosen few are capable to take such burden. All others, the ordinary, common man, would gladly resign to exercise free will to follow the lead of anyone offering miracle, mystery or authority.Watching the trial against Captain Wirz, and how he emotionally melts down by the end, I couldn't stop thinking he is not an evil monster but one of those ""ordinary souls"" willing to override his own free will for that of his military superiors.  Faced to the atrocities of the camp he was responsible for, his only way to justify or excuse himself for his decisions is to convince himself and the jury that he had no choice but to obey.Also, since this is a moral question more than anything else, is the authority of the tribunal valid enough to judge this man? Being the victor authorize you to judge a defeated man in an environment full of hatred?These and more questions make this drama still relevant today.The production is very effective; it has the sense of intimacy and immediacy of a small theater venue. The acting is uniformly superb; seeing Richard Basehart on the final sequence is almost painful to watch; you are so involved on the play, that at no time you are thinking this is an actor doing a good job; it's only captain Wirz's final attempt of justification.Thoroughly recommended, especially for theater lovers and people interested in American history",4,Still relevant,1292284800,"12 14, 2010",2010,2337,"['Reviewers', 'have', 'described', 'basics', 'court', 'drama', 'very', 'thought', 'provoking', 'piece', 'will', 'linger', 'mind', 'long', 'are', 'it.I', 'found', 'thinking', 'Brothers', 'Karamazov', 'chapter', 'Grand', 'Inquisitor', 'chapter', 'Ivan', 'Karamazov', 'telling', 'younger', 'tale', 'Grand', 'Inquisitor', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'returns', 'earth', 'XV', 'century', 'Spain', 'when', 'miracle', 'resurrecting', 'child', 'multitude', 'applauding', 'then', 'Inquisition', 'arrest', 'heresy', 'cell', 'silent', 'Jesus', 'confronted', 'old', 'Grand', 'Inquisitor', 'who', 'Lord', 'placing', 'unbearable', 'responsibility', 'mankind', 'free', 'will', 'Nothing', 'more', 'attractive', 'more', 'terrible', 'man', 'free', 'will', 'meaning', 'choice', '-well', 'not', 'only', 'choice', 'moral', 'obligation-', 'discerning', 'what', 'wrong', 'what', 'right', 'Grand', 'Inquisitor', 'only', 'few', 'man', 'woman', 'Saints', 'Chosen', 'few', 'are', 'capable', 'take', 'such', 'burden', 'others', 'ordinary', 'common', 'man', 'would', 'gladly', 'resign', 'exercise', 'free', 'will', 'follow', 'lead', 'anyone', 'offering', 'miracle', 'mystery', 'authority.Watching', 'trial', 'Captain', 'Wirz', 'how', 'emotionally', 'melts', 'down', 'end', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'thinking', 'not', 'evil', 'monster', 'one', 'ordinary', 'souls', 'willing', 'override', 'own', 'free', 'will', 'military', 'superiors', 'Faced', 'atrocities', 'camp', 'was', 'responsible', 'only', 'way', 'justify', 'excuse', 'decisions', 'convince', 'jury', 'had', 'choice', 'obey.Also', 'moral', 'question', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'authority', 'tribunal', 'valid', 'enough', 'judge', 'man', 'Being', 'victor', 'authorize', 'judge', 'defeated', 'man', 'environment', 'full', 'hatred', 'more', 'questions', 'make', 'drama', 'still', 'relevant', 'today.The', 'production', 'very', 'effective', 'sense', 'intimacy', 'immediacy', 'small', 'theater', 'venue', 'acting', 'uniformly', 'superb', 'seeing', 'Richard', 'Basehart', 'final', 'sequence', 'almost', 'painful', 'watch', 'are', 'so', 'involved', 'play', 'time', 'are', 'thinking', 'actor', 'doing', 'good', 'job', 'only', 'captain', 'Wirz', 'final', 'attempt', 'justification.Thoroughly', 'recommended', 'especially', 'theater', 'lovers', 'people', 'interested', 'American', 'history']",N/A
760801,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B0000A0DTC,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[2, 2]","I believe this was Masterpiece Theater. In any case, it was a TV production of a Broadway Play that was very successful. It was directed by George C. Scott, who makes a comment at the beginning, saying that he was an actor in the play when it was on Broadway. He doesn't mention which role, but I assume he had the one filled here by William Shatner.The defendant is Captain Henry Wirz (Richard Basehart), commander of the Confederate prison camp at Andersonville, where some 14,000 Yankee prisoners died, and many more suffered terribly under abominable conditions which are detailed in the play. Defense counsel is Otis Baker (Jack Cassidy), who does his best though he is aware of the fact that Wirz will be found guilty of war crimes and executed. The prosecutor is Lt. Col. NP Chipman (William Shatner), who does a brilliant job as a lawyer, as Shatner does as an actor. A couple of other familiar faces are Martin Sheen as Captain Williams, one of the witnesses, and Buddy Ebsen as Dr. John Bates, who had been the physician assigned to the camp, apparently more to keep records of the dead then with any hope of treating them, since he had no medical supplies.As the testimony progresses, we get pretty horrible details of just what happened at Andersonville, but we get more: insight into the character of Captain Wirz. He was, as the defendants at Nuremberg declared, just following orders. Finally, in the last 20 minutes of the play, Wirz insists on taking the stand in his own defense (and indeed, has no other witnesses on his behalf) to try to explain why he did what he did. Chipman very effectively demolishes his defenses, both legal and psychic.A very moving performance.

760802,A281387UUS2IN5,B0000A0DTC,Beantown Jim,"[1, 1]","When you combine a riveting subject with an all-time great cast. great directing(George C. Scott) in a Broadway play presentation, you have the makings of a great moment in theatric history.The subject was Andersonville, the horrific Georgia concentration camp for prisoners of war held by a weakening Confederacy during the American Civil War.  In the early part of the war, prisoners were exchanged; when that ended, places like Andersonville sprang up, overflowing with POW's that the captor(Confederacy) could barely afford to house or feed.  The result was catastrophic, with POW's dying from disease, starvation and overall neglect.  Wirz, the commandant of the camp, was ordered to hold the men.  He did so regardless of the humanitarian crises and for that, he was justifiably arrested after the war.  He was tried and justifiably executed soon after. The 'moral dilemma' of his, obeying orders or letting men return home under an oath not to return to arms, was not a conception he considered.  He had his orders and obeyed.The cast, including William Shatner as the prosecutor, Cameron Mitchell as the judge, Richard Basehart as the defendant, and Jack Cassidy in his finest role as defense attorney, was incredible, particularly Cameron Mitchell who 'stole the show'.  In reality, General Lew Wallace(who saved Washington in 1864 and later wrote Ben-Hur) was the judge among a tribunal.  You will be stunned at the themes, which were intended to address modern (World War II, Vietnam) wars and not just the Civil War.My only reservation of recommending this incredible drama is the price.  Like another great work, Schindler's List, another 'must see' drama, you will be moved.  However, like most cathartic presentations, you are not likely watch it again, at least not for some time.  So, given that, I would look to pay a modest sum for this otherwise incredible dramatic DVD.",5,A Landmark Achievement in Drama,1390003200,"01 18, 2014",2014,1890,"['When', 'combine', 'riveting', 'subject', 'all-time', 'great', 'cast', 'great', 'directing', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'Broadway', 'play', 'presentation', 'have', 'makings', 'great', 'moment', 'theatric', 'history.The', 'subject', 'was', 'Andersonville', 'horrific', 'Georgia', 'concentration', 'camp', 'prisoners', 'war', 'held', 'weakening', 'Confederacy', 'American', 'Civil', 'War', 'early', 'part', 'war', 'prisoners', 'were', 'exchanged', 'when', 'ended', 'places', 'Andersonville', 'sprang', 'up', 'overflowing', 'POW', 'captor', 'Confederacy', 'could', 'barely', 'afford', 'house', 'feed', 'result', 'was', 'catastrophic', 'POW', 'dying', 'disease', 'starvation', 'overall', 'neglect', 'Wirz', 'commandant', 'camp', 'was', 'ordered', 'hold', 'men', 'did', 'so', 'regardless', 'humanitarian', 'crises', 'was', 'justifiably', 'arrested', 'war', 'was', 'tried', 'justifiably', 'executed', 'soon', ""'moral"", 'dilemma', 'obeying', 'orders', 'letting', 'men', 'return', 'home', 'oath', 'not', 'return', 'arms', 'was', 'not', 'conception', 'considered', 'had', 'orders', 'obeyed.The', 'cast', 'including', 'William', 'Shatner', 'prosecutor', 'Cameron', 'Mitchell', 'judge', 'Richard', 'Basehart', 'defendant', 'Jack', 'Cassidy', 'finest', 'role', 'defense', 'attorney', 'was', 'incredible', 'particularly', 'Cameron', 'Mitchell', 'who', ""'stole"", 'show', 'reality', 'General', 'Lew', 'Wallace', 'who', 'saved', 'Washington', '1864', 'later', 'wrote', 'Ben-Hur', 'was', 'judge', 'tribunal', 'will', 'be', 'stunned', 'themes', 'were', 'intended', 'address', 'modern', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Vietnam', 'wars', 'not', 'just', 'Civil', 'War.My', 'only', 'reservation', 'recommending', 'incredible', 'drama', 'price', 'great', 'work', 'Schindler', 'List', ""'must"", 'see', 'drama', 'will', 'be', 'moved', 'However', 'most', 'cathartic', 'presentations', 'are', 'not', 'likely', 'watch', 'again', 'least', 'not', 'time', 'So', 'given', 'would', 'look', 'pay', 'modest', 'sum', 'otherwise', 'incredible', 'dramatic', 'DVD']",N/A

760806,APUHDIL2CEI3C,B0000A0DTC,Dr. Victor S. Alpher,"[1, 1]","When was the last time you saw REAL acting?I remembered this PBS production vividly as when I saw it, ahem, 37 years ago!!  It harkens back to William Shatner's acting on The Twilight Zone, before he became almost a parody of himself (that record album) or a brand name (for Priceline).Yes, there is real acting here, including a portrayal of post-traumatic stress disorder (before it was an official diagnosis)...the real stars are Cassidy and Shatner, but Shatner really outshines them all.  When he comes to conclude that perhaps this really is a sham trial, and that soldiers following orders cannot and should not be put on trial, that the ""evidence"" against Wirz is flimsy at best (or at least as the trial preparation went).  The young Lt. Col. J.A. realizes that he is effectively killing a man for his government as well as a musket ball could.  ""I was only following orders"" is not offered as a defense, as it would years later for equally abhorrent war crimes.  Today, ""rules of engagement"" have replaced direct orders as the ultimate arbiters, making such political prosecutions much easier to mount.There is no doubt that Andersonville was a horrible place--and place confining humans in a small space will ultimately become a place of disease, demoralization, and desecration.  However, the focus of this trial rings as relevant today as it did in the height of the Vietnam War.  Can a soldier disobey an order as ""immoral""?  As John F. Kennedy said of the failed Bay of Pigs invasion, ""Victory has many fathers, while defeat is an orphan.""  One can easily see that in a room full of Generals, Colonels, in their glamorous uniforms, the Victors, one defeated Captain hardly stood a chance of exoneration in a time of bitter conflict and martial law.No special effects, no camera shifting, no profanity or racial slurs, just excellent acting, and well worth the price of admission.",5,Celebrates Real Acting of Yesteryear,1177545600,"04 26, 2007",2007,1894,"['When', 'was', 'last', 'time', 'saw', 'REAL', 'acting', 'remembered', 'PBS', 'production', 'vividly', 'when', 'saw', 'ahem', '37', 'years', 'ago', 'back', 'William', 'Shatner', 'acting', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'became', 'almost', 'parody', 'record', 'album', 'brand', 'name', 'Priceline', '.Yes', 'real', 'acting', 'here', 'including', 'portrayal', 'post-traumatic', 'stress', 'disorder', 'was', 'official', 'diagnosis', 'real', 'stars', 'are', 'Cassidy', 'Shatner', 'Shatner', 'really', 'When', 'conclude', 'perhaps', 'really', 'sham', 'trial', 'soldiers', 'following', 'orders', 'can', 'not', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'put', 'trial', 'evidence', 'Wirz', 'flimsy', 'best', 'least', 'trial', 'preparation', 'went', 'young', 'Lt.', 'Col.', 'J.A', 'effectively', 'killing', 'man', 'government', 'as', 'well', 'musket', 'ball', 'could', 'was', 'only', 'following', 'orders', 'not', 'offered', 'defense', 'would', 'years', 'later', 'equally', 'abhorrent', 'war', 'crimes', 'Today', 'rules', 'engagement', 'have', 'replaced', 'direct', 'orders', 'ultimate', 'arbiters', 'making', 'such', 'political', 'prosecutions', 'much', 'easier', 'mount.There', 'doubt', 'Andersonville', 'was', 'horrible', 'place', 'place', 'confining', 'humans', 'small', 'space', 'will', 'ultimately', 'become', 'place', 'disease', 'demoralization', 'desecration', 'However', 'focus', 'trial', 'rings', 'relevant', 'today', 'did', 'height', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'Can', 'soldier', 'disobey', 'order', 'immoral', 'John', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'said', 'failed', 'Bay', 'Pigs', 'invasion', 'Victory', 'many', 'fathers', 'defeat', 'orphan', 'One', 'can', 'easily', 'see', 'room', 'full', 'Generals', 'Colonels', 'glamorous', 'uniforms', 'Victors', 'one', 'defeated', 'Captain', 'hardly', 'stood', 'chance', 'exoneration', 'time', 'bitter', 'conflict', 'martial', 'law.No', 'special', 'effects', 'camera', 'shifting', 'profanity', 'racial', 'slurs', 'just', 'excellent', 'acting', 'well', 'price', 'admission']",N/A

I was one of those viewers.THE ANDERSONVILLE TRIAL's images have remained with me.  Watching this again has brought back those memories. The quality of the production is still vivid and the story just as riveting.The trial of Captain Henry Wirz, the commandant of the Confederate Prisoner of War Camp known as Andersonville, is a look at a man who oversaw the death of 14,000 Union prisoners out of 45,000. The South Carolinian prisoner camp is aptly described as hell on earth.You have the brilliant Richard Baseheart playing Captain Henry Wirz, a man crippled by war both physically and mentally.  Jack Cassidy plays Otis Baker, defense attorney whose performance won him an Emmy nomination. Otis Baker knows his client has no chance with the North looking for a scapegoat and vengeance.William Shatner gives a stirring performance as Lt. Col. N. P. Chipman, Judge Advocate, the prosecutor. As the trial progresses Chipman wrestles with a question that he knows that should not be raised, yet he is determined to bring his question into this arena with possible fallout to his career.  His question is simple yet complex--why would a man allow such atrocities under his command and not defy his superior's orders?  The moral ambiguity of command and conscience becomes his passion to the consternation of the Judges, Union Generals who know that this line of questioning by Chipman is a Pandora's Box.Cameron Mitchell gives one of his best performances as Chief Judge Lew Wallace who is weary and does not want to travel the path of Chipman.  The conversations between Wallace and Chipman are well written and laden with emotion.Buddy Ebsen plays the camp's doctor, Dr. John Bates, whose contempt for Captain Henry Wirz is displayed in almost every sentence during his testimony.  His recitation of the death statistics is chilling.A young Martin Sheen plays Captain Williams, the main guard for Wirz.  He is not much more than window dressing, but his presence is notable by his silence.If you want to spend 141 minutes watching this fine production, you will not be disappointed.One last comment:The performance of Michael Burns as James Davidson is the most touching in the whole production.  The nineteen year old relates in a haunting fashion how it was in Andersonville.

760809,A2MNB9PF4QMK9P,B0000A0DTC,"givbatam3 ""givbatam3""","[2, 2]","Watching this fine, engrossing production (why don't they make films like this any more?) left me strangely depressed.  First I will state why I think it was so good....several well-known television actors put in outstanding performances: (1) William Shatner as the prosecutor, Col. Chipman.  Shatner is an uneven performer, and he indeed starts out a little shakey in this one, but towards the end, when Chipman decides to risk his own career, after being warned by Chief Judge Gen. Wallace, he decides to throw caution to the wind and directly address the defendent's (Capt. Wirz) moral culpability in carrying out immoral orders without question, Shatner comes out full force with an outstanding performance.(2) Richard Basehart, as Capt. Wirz who at first seems to be a victim of ""victor's justice"", loses control of himself and emotionally destroys himself in front of the court as he hysterically describes his futile attempts to prevent the starving, abused Union prisoners from trying to burrow out of the camp ""like rats"". (3) Jack Cassidy as defense attorney Otis Baker.  Cassidy was a truly outstanding actor, and he plays the  part beautifully, knowing when to badger a weak witness, but gently probing uncertainties in the testimony of a badly traumatized young survivor of Andersonville, without abusing him.  (4) Cameron Mitchell, as Chief Judge General Wallace, who initially resists any attempt to call Wirz to account for his failure to disobey orders in the name of humanity, but is painfully forced to admit that the Wirz's moral universe must be explored, even at the expense of questioning military discipline.Director George C Scott, in a filmed introduction, alludes to ""current events"" in the 1970 production, which is the War in Vietnam, and more specifically, the My Lai atrocities carried out by American soldiers who were confronting an enemy who hid among the  civilian population.  Frankly, I don't know exactly how good the comparison between William Calley, who was  charged with committing the atrocity, and Wirz was, because Wirz was in charge of enemy prisoners were were basically helpless, whereas in Vietnam, the American soldiers  were confrontingan active enemy who was deliberately dragging a civilian population into the conflict.In any event, as I stated above, I felt depressed at the end, because hearing of the horrors at Andersonville and Wirz's ultimate indifferenceto the suffering he oversaw, reminded me of much more recent horrors, from the Holocaust, Stalin's Gulag, Pol Pot and Mao Tse-tung's mass terror and concentration camps, not to mention numerous others.I kept reminding myself, that THIS WAS AMERICANS DOING THESE HORRIBLE THINGS TO EACH OTHER...people who had been part of the same nation, spoke the same language and had the same religions.

Crabtree ""Doc Crabtree""","[2, 3]","In this performance Captain Henry Wirz is put on trial for war crimes, the only soldier of the Civil War to be so tried. He is being tried for running the notorious Confederate POW camp knows as Andersonville, where Union sildiers were kept in the open under conditions which at the best of times were wretched, and at the worst were virtually genocidal. Thousands of prisoners died of exposure, disease and starvation there.The question is, how culpable was Wirz? As a Confederate officer he was ordered to run the camp as his superior, General Winder, saw fit. He was specifically ordered to maintain conditions as they were in revenge for reported poor conditions in Union POW camps, such as the one in Elmyra NY. The inefficiency of the Confederate supply system meant rations never kept up with the number of prisoners being sent to the camp. Winder was dead. Did Wirz hold responsibility for the camp? What was his moral obligations to his fellow man? Did the survival of the men have to take precedent over keeping them imprisoned? Did his excuse of obeying orders make him not culpable for the consequences of  carrying them out?This drama is performed very well. William Shatner is a natural as the prosecutor and Richard Basehart gives an excellent performance as Wirz himself. I found myself unable to break away from this program once it was on for ten minutes.

This Television drama, directed by George C. Scott (Patton) was one of the best ever to appear on the tube. The country was going through Vietnam and all of the implications that the war had influenced on the American psyche, and this play hits home on war issues even though it concerns the American Civil War. Cameron Mitchell is great and we get a performance from Jack Cassidy (one of the two guests ever to appear on Columbo 3 times)that was nominated for outstanding single performance by an actor in a leading role in this play as the Defense Lawyer. Richard Basehart as the defendant is also very impressive and the whole play is full of interesting testimony. Fans will remember the early appearance of Martin Sheen in a small role and the legendary Captain Kirk, William Shatner,doing his Kirkus-Maximus in the lead role of the prosecution. It is a long play and perhaps should be viewed over two evenings so that you don't fall asleep and miss something important.

760813,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0000A0DTC,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[37, 38]","The most important thing to remember about this Peabody Award winning production of Saul Levitt's play &quot;The Andersonville Trial&quot; is that it was produced in 1970, during the Vietnam War.  However, the play was originally produced on Broadway in 1959, which is rather surprising because this particular version has a reputation for being a historic allegory in the grand tradition of &quot;The Crucible.&quot;  In 1959 the historic parallel would have been to the Nuremberg Trials where Nazi leaders were tried as war criminals.  But in the wake of the My Lai massacre the court-martial of Capt. Henry Wirz (Richard Basehart), commandant of the infamous Andersonville prison during the Civil War it would be impossible for an audience to view this drama as anything else that a discussion of the war in Vietnam.Henry Wirz was the only Confederate soldier to be convicted and executed for war crimes during the Civil War.  Wirz remains a controversial figure whose name is associated with some of the worst atrocities of the war by many while considered a martyr to the Glorious Cause by others.  As Union forces pushed into the South the Confederacy was ending up with more and more Union prisoners and the Andersonville Camp was created to relieve the situation in Richmond and elsewhere.  However, in June of 1864 the Union discontinued the policy of prisoner exchanges and without that avenue of release or the construction of another facility, the prisoner population of Andersonville swelled to 26,000 prisoners crammed into a little more than 26 acres.  Add to this the impoverishment of the Confederacy in the final year of the war when the 33,000 prisoners in Andersonville made it the fifth largest &quot;city&quot; in the Confederacy, and it is hardly surprising that hundreds of men were dying each day.  Of the 45,000 prisoners sent to Andersonville, 13,000 died.Levitt used the official record of the trial of Henry Wirz as his basic source material.  While sticking to the facts, Levitt was obviously more interested in the personalities involved in the proceedings.  So while &quot;The Andersonville Trial&quot; is accurate with regards to the time and place of the trial, names of the participants, and some of the dialogue, it is still much more of a drama than a documentary.  Furthermore, as a televised stage play it is necessarily restricted to the primary set of the courtroom and the scope of its interest is pretty much restricted to that venue as well.The pivotal character of the drama is Lt. Colonel N.P. Chipman (William Shatner in the role Scott played in the original Broadway production), the officer prosecuting Wirz (Richard Basehart), who responds to the charges against him with the defense that he was obeying orders and doing what he could under the circumstances.  This leads Chipman to the conclusion what Wirz should have done was disobey orders that would lead to the deaths of thousands of prisoners.  However, this is not an argument that an officer in the military can make lightly, and this sets up a conflict with the presiding judge, General Lew Wallace (Cameron Mitchell), who would achieve fame as the author of &quot;Be-Hur: A Tale of the Christ.&quot;  But Chipman feels compelled to come up with a response to the argument that following such orders is a legitimate defense.Shatner's performance is superb, and those who remember playing Spencer Tracy's aide in &quot;Judgment at Nuremberg&quot; can appreciate the irony of his having a larger role in this related drama.  The biggest compliment I can give Shatner's work is that I cannot imagine George C. Scott having played this role.  One of the strengths of this production is how Scott takes a collection of &quot;television stars&quot; like Shatner, Basehart, Jack Cassidy, Buddy Ebsen, Martin Sheen, John Anderson and Whit Bissell, along with veteran character actors like Mitchell and Albert Salmi, to create a stellar ensemble cast.  Just as impressive is how he has actors like Alan Hale, Jr. and Kenneth Tobey sitting as members of the Court-martial board.  For Shatner, Basehart, Cassidy, Mitchell and Salmi you will be hard pressed to find anything better on their acting resumes.&quot;The Andersonville Trial&quot; is one of the most powerful courtroom dramas you will ever see.  It has something of an advantage over the likes of &quot;The Caine Mutiny&quot; and &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; in that the play is almost entirely the trial, which makes it more like &quot;Breaker Morant&quot; and, most obviously,&quot; Judgment at Nuremberg.&quot;  The drama comes down to Chipman's cross-examination of Wirz and the prosecutor's futile effort to get the prisoner in the dock to explain why he did not do the &quot;right&quot; thing and disobey his orders.  I think the net effect is to make Wirz more of a tragic figure than a monster, locked into a system of rules and beliefs that would not let him see a way out of the disaster happening before him.",5,A

760815,A319KYEIAZ3SON,B0000A0DTC,Mary Whipple,"[7, 8]","Directed by George C. Scott, and starring Richard Basehart, Cameron Mitchell, Jack Cassidy, William Shatner, Martin Sheen, and Buddy Ebsen in some of their best roles ever, this stunning 1970 production was a shoo-in to win three Emmys and the Peabody Award, with Cassidy also nominated for an Emmy as Best Actor.  Filled with the kind of drama that only a real war crimes trial can generate, the play by Saul Levitt focuses on the trial of a German-born Confederate captain who was in charge of the Andersonville Prison in Georgia, where Union soldiers died at the rate of over a hundred men a day during their incarceration in 1864.  Living in overcrowded conditions without shelter, shade, clean water, or adequate food, the men became desperate, preferring to risk being shot during escape attempts to living in the squalid and unsanitary conditions of the prison.Captain Wirz (Richard Basehart in one of his all-time best dramatic roles), was in charge of the prison and is now on trial.  His counsel, southern lawyer Otis Baker (Jack Cassidy), is highly skilled at twisting words, and brilliant at forcing the court to consider the rules of wartime engagement and the necessity of following orders.  The courtroom battles between Baker and the Union prosecutor, Col. N. P. Chipman (William Shatner, when he was young and hungry for great acting jobs), are memorable for the philosophical complexities of their arguments and the emotions with which they argue their positions.  Gen. Lew Wallace (Cameron Mitchell) is hard pressed to keep the two sides in order and arguing relevant legal issues.Buddy Ebsen, a fine actor who does not deserve to be remembered primarily for ""Beverly Hillbillies,"" is the doctor who worked at the prison for eight months, a man who shows how his compassion gradually became dulled by the horrors of the conditions, until he became inured to the hundreds of deaths he had to certify every day.  Michael Burns as James Davidson, a nineteen-year-old Vermont soldier who was incarcerated at Andersonville, shows the traumatic effects of his experiences as he testifies, his role becoming one of the most sympathetic in the entire play.George C. Scott, as director, gets the finest performances possible from these actors and wrings the play of every moment of drama.  The tension is so great that viewers will easily sit through the two-and-a-half hour performance, breathless with anticipation, their emotions soaring with the legal points made by the prosecution and soaring equally with the human feelings engendered by the defense.

This made for television post Civil War drama was shot exactly like live theater, with no cuts, giving the experience of an actual theater performance.
