1155645,A2B7SS9OH87HLR,B00171H13U,Boston Reader,"[2, 2]","In this season we start off with an episode about a murder committed by a born again radical Muslim. As a Muslim myself it was almost hard to watch. Every time this man showed his anger and bigotry, i felt my heart sink. It was an interesting episode and kind of ironic considering the season finale for the previous season. Introduced to us in this episode was District Attorney Arthur Branch. One of the only characters in the universe to be in all four New York based Law & Order series. Played by the amazing Fred Dalton Thompson, D.A Branch was a character to come in a time he was needed. A conservative D.A as opposed to his liberal predecessors. At the time the country was still shaken by the horrendous attacks that took place about a year prior. Two wars followed. This was a time One Hogan Place needed a conservative voice and figure to lead prosecutions into cases presiding in New York County in the Law & Order universe. What else came out of this season were another batch of interesting episodes with societal and sociological questions. Probably the most heart-wrenching is the episode &#34;Sheltered,&#34; which had a lot of psychological insight as well lacked it. Another highlight is the 300th episode of the series, &#34;Couples.&#34; Much like the episode &#34;Mayhem&#34; from season 4, the detectives are overwhelmed with a heavy caseload as they deal with multiple murders, a kidnapping and a possible suicide. I cannot find a reason why this season should not be part of your collection. Every fan of this great series and this fantastic franchise should own a copy of this season on DVD.",5,D.A Branch's First Season,1376524800,"08 15, 2013",2013,1617,"['season', 'start', 'off', 'episode', 'murder', 'committed', 'born', 'again', 'radical', 'Muslim', 'Muslim', 'was', 'almost', 'hard', 'watch', 'time', 'man', 'showed', 'anger', 'bigotry', 'i', 'felt', 'heart', 'sink', 'was', 'interesting', 'episode', 'kind', 'ironic', 'considering', 'season', 'finale', 'previous', 'season', 'Introduced', 'episode', 'was', 'District', 'Attorney', 'Arthur', 'Branch', 'One', 'only', 'characters', 'universe', 'be', 'four', 'New', 'York', 'based', 'Law', 'Order', 'series', 'Played', 'amazing', 'Fred', 'Dalton', 'Thompson', 'D.A', 'Branch', 'was', 'character', 'come', 'time', 'was', 'needed', 'conservative', 'D.A', 'opposed', 'liberal', 'predecessors', 'time', 'country', 'was', 'still', 'shaken', 'horrendous', 'attacks', 'took', 'place', 'year', 'prior', 'Two', 'wars', 'followed', 'was', 'time', 'One', 'Hogan', 'Place', 'needed', 'conservative', 'voice', 'figure', 'lead', 'prosecutions', 'cases', 'presiding', 'New', 'York', 'County', 'Law', 'Order', 'universe', 'What', 'else', 'came', 'season', 'were', 'batch', 'interesting', 'episodes', 'societal', 'sociological', 'questions', 'Probably', 'most', 'heart-wrenching', 'episode', '34', 'Sheltered', '34', 'had', 'lot', 'psychological', 'insight', 'as', 'well', 'highlight', '300th', 'episode', 'series', '34', 'Couples.', '34', 'Much', 'episode', '34', 'Mayhem', '34', 'season', '4', 'detectives', 'are', 'overwhelmed', 'heavy', 'caseload', 'deal', 'multiple', 'murders', 'kidnapping', 'possible', 'suicide', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'reason', 'why', 'season', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'part', 'collection', 'fan', 'great', 'series', 'fantastic', 'franchise', 'should', 'own', 'copy', 'season', 'DVD']",N/A

After the third or fourth year are the best ones. We sold the ones we had that were before that. It was a good show. Sam Waterson and Jerry Orbach were the best. Of course, Jerry's health was the reason he left and we saw Sam age right before our eyes but it almost seemed they did something to make his hair grow more gray really fast. Some of the assisant's DA's were not so great but we loved it anyway. Jerry's replacement grew on us but his stay was short after. Never cared for any of the policement after Jesse Greene left or his last two partners. We also did not like the last ADA and never understood why Connie didn't get that position since she was second chair to Jerry. This one is still with characters we enjoy watching (with the exception of the District Attorney) so we will watch this over and over as we have done with several of them.

1155655,AGB7UQZMVHNUJ,B00171H13U,"NewDiane ""I live to read!""","[14, 18]","It says a lot for his acting ability that at times I had trouble remembering that the views expressed by DA Arthur Branch were not necessarily those of the actor portraying him, Fred Dalton Thompson. I cordially loathed him throughout his years on Law & Order. Now Sam Waterston, as EADA Jack McCoy, not only has to fight ignorant, biased or obstinate judges, underhanded, sleazy and even criminal defense attorneys, he has to deal with this red-neck boss. This is a very good season, but not the best. One of the most interesting episodes feels incomplete, because it focuses on a very busy day for the detectives and practically omits the DA's office entirely. It's a nice change of pace to see the detectives deal with overwork instead of showing them on just one case. There is a particularly annoying episode, Chosen, which features a slimy lawyer whose neck should be wrung, and an excellent one in which an apparent domestic terrorist turns out to have a surprise motive. As always, several of the stories are riffs on actual events, including 9/11, but the viewer never gets the feeling that 9/11 is being used as a gimmick or treated with disrespect. Back to the DA - one of the things I dislike about this casting, despite Thompson's acting chops, is that I can't remotely imagine NYC ever having a DA like this, which strikes a seriously jarring note.
