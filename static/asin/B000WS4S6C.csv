1111429,ADES8B01WRPI3,B000WS4S6C,"Bryan E. Leed ""Jesus says, 'Go and Sin No More!""","[3, 3]","This version of THE TEN COMMANDMENTS on DVD is a computer-animated movie suitable for all ages and all levels of Bible knowledge.The movie is a condensed telling of the story, in 88 minutes, but it hits all the major points without contradicting any Bible teachings, though some small details of the story have been edited and/or combined to get the story told so quickly.If you know a lot about the Bible story of Moses and the Ten Commandments, you will enjoy seeing how much they got right while making mental notes about minor points where it deviates from the Bible verses.If you know little about this Bible story, you will still be able to enjoy seeing the events unfold and you will get the gist of the message without any great errors concerning Biblical accuracy.If you enjoy the classic Charlton Heston version of THE TEN COMMANDMENTS, then you may enjoy seeing some things in this version that remind you more of the Charlton Heston version than of the Bible, like the Dathan character, or the scene when Moses is exiled into the desert by his adopted brother (which is NOT a Bible passage). These little ""tributes"" to the classic Charlton Heston version just add to the enjoyment, without taking away from this animated version's Biblical fidelity.The Ten Commandments (50th Anniversary Collection)Sometimes they have some contemporary viewpoints sprinkled in, also without doing any damage to the Bible version, like when Moses prepares to fight off the shepards at the sheep well in the desert, warning them, ""I'm a dead man to Pharoah and my donkey has a bad temper...""There are also some Bible situations that we don't get to see too often, like Manna and quail in the desert, and the traveling tabernacle.This animated version of THE TEN COMMANDMENTS is faster paced and more consistently accurate to the Bible than the TV mini-series of a couple years earlier, starring Dougray Scott as Moses, which had great acting, costumes, sets, and scenery, but strayed from Scripture more than it would admit to.The Ten CommandmentsThis animated DVD of THE TEN COMMANDMENTS is perfectly suitable for showing to children to teach them the story of Moses and the Ten Commandments!",5,"Bible-based, Fast Paced Telling of the Moses Story Using Computer 3D Animation!",1205625600,"03 16, 2008",2008,2187,"['version', 'THE', 'TEN', 'COMMANDMENTS', 'DVD', 'computer-animated', 'movie', 'suitable', 'ages', 'levels', 'Bible', 'knowledge.The', 'movie', 'condensed', 'telling', 'story', '88', 'minutes', 'major', 'points', 'contradicting', 'Bible', 'teachings', 'small', 'details', 'story', 'have', 'been', 'edited', 'and/or', 'combined', 'get', 'story', 'told', 'so', 'quickly.If', 'know', 'lot', 'Bible', 'story', 'Moses', 'Ten', 'Commandments', 'will', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'how', 'much', 'got', 'right', 'making', 'mental', 'notes', 'minor', 'points', 'where', 'Bible', 'verses.If', 'know', 'little', 'Bible', 'story', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'able', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'events', 'unfold', 'will', 'get', 'gist', 'message', 'great', 'errors', 'concerning', 'Biblical', 'accuracy.If', 'enjoy', 'classic', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'version', 'THE', 'TEN', 'COMMANDMENTS', 'then', 'may', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'things', 'version', 'remind', 'more', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'version', 'Bible', 'Dathan', 'character', 'scene', 'when', 'Moses', 'exiled', 'desert', 'adopted', 'brother', 'NOT', 'Bible', 'passage', 'little', 'tributes', 'classic', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'version', 'just', 'add', 'enjoyment', 'taking', 'away', 'animated', 'version', 'Biblical', 'fidelity.The', 'Ten', 'Commandments', '50th', 'Anniversary', 'Collection', 'Sometimes', 'have', 'contemporary', 'viewpoints', 'sprinkled', 'also', 'doing', 'damage', 'Bible', 'version', 'when', 'Moses', 'fight', 'off', 'shepards', 'sheep', 'well', 'desert', 'warning', ""'m"", 'dead', 'man', 'Pharoah', 'donkey', 'bad', 'temper', 'are', 'also', 'Bible', 'situations', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'too', 'often', 'Manna', 'quail', 'desert', 'traveling', 'tabernacle.This', 'animated', 'version', 'THE', 'TEN', 'COMMANDMENTS', 'faster', 'paced', 'more', 'consistently', 'accurate', 'Bible', 'TV', 'mini-series', 'couple', 'years', 'earlier', 'starring', 'Dougray', 'Scott', 'Moses', 'had', 'great', 'acting', 'costumes', 'sets', 'scenery', 'strayed', 'Scripture', 'more', 'would', 'admit', 'to.The', 'Ten', 'CommandmentsThis', 'animated', 'DVD', 'THE', 'TEN', 'COMMANDMENTS', 'perfectly', 'suitable', 'showing', 'children', 'teach', 'story', 'Moses', 'Ten', 'Commandments']",N/A

First off, the voice casting is so off-target. CHRISTIAN SLATER AS MOSES?!!! ELLIOTT GOULD AS GOD?!!! You've gotta be frickin' kidding me. Though Slater's a fine actor (""Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves,"" ""Interview With The Vampire""), he simply does not have the voice for Moses (too wimpy), whereas Val Kilmer definitely had a good voice for Moses, which reminds viewers of Charlton Heston (the DEFINITIVE Moses). Mel Gibson would have been a better choice for Moses. Elliott Gould has such a weak voice for God (he was an even worse casting choice than Slater), he's not even convincing (he sounded asleep). James Earl Jones, Laurence Fishburne, Michael Clarke Duncan or Christopher Lee would have been excellent choices for the voice of God. They have very strong and deep voices and would sound very convincing. Secondly, the ""Animation"" was really computer-generated garbage. ""Toy Story,"" ""Toy Story 2,"" ""Monsters Inc"" & ""Finding Nemo"" (I've not yet seen ""Toy Story 3"") are much better examples of computer-generated movies. The animation in this film looked like crap, I wanted to shut my eyes, as it was giving me a headache. Good thing I caught this movie On Demand, and didn't have to waste money on this garbage. See either version of ""The Ten Commandments"" or ""The Prince Of Egypt"" and avoid this atrocious 4th remake by all means. Of course, reading the Biblical story of Moses (Exodus-Deuteronomy) is the best choice, because it's true, and the visual medium of film helps, but it's no substitute for reading the Word Of God (avoid the NIV and other modern translations like the plague and read either the King James Version or the New King James Version, but make sure that the NKJV has the word ""Lucifer"" instead of ""Morning-star"" in Isaiah 14:12, because the term ""Morning-star"" is a title for Jesus, and versions that have ""Morning-star"" in Isaiah 14:12 imply blasphemy).",1,"ATROCIOUS Remake Of ""The Ten Commandments"" & ""The Prince Of Egypt.""

1111445,AX9ZYSNJKJJK6,B000WS4S6C,R. Wolfe,"[11, 11]","I have a 4-year old son who has access to decent library of animated material at home and he often requests this movie.  We have owned it for several months.  As a parent, I like that it sticks pretty closely to the source material of the Bible itself and lacks low brow humor and use of poor language--something many ""children's movies"" actually include a lot of these days.  The story follows Moses's life from his trip down the river in the basket to his death just as the people finally enter the Promised Land.  Please note, this movie is geared toward children, but it should be known that it does not avoid issues like Pharoah's issuing of the command to kill Israel's firstborn children, the Angel of Death's arrival to do the same to Egypt's children, attempted murder, accidental homicide, and mass drowning, among other things.  If your children are being exposed to these stories already, then it brings the whole thing alive and together well.  If you aren't sure your child is ready for these themes, maybe you need to preview it first.There are some interesting reviews floating around for this movie.  More than a few reviews I have read online seem to have mentioned that the computer animation was sub-par.  I believe this is due to some weaker character designs being more prominent towards the beginning of the movie; some of the childrens' faces are really not the strongest.  They aren't prominant figures, and the bulk of the character designs are good or great for this genre.  Which seems to mean exaggerated features and rubbery people--this is the standard even for a Pixar movie.  That stated, the overwhelming majority is top-notch, the faces are actually quite expressive and help carry the story along in places.  The backgrounds are excellent, and there are some well-executed touches of realism, like the slaves having whip marks over their bodies.  Really, it's not quite a Pixar offering's level of animation, but it is not cheap or ""god awful"" as I have read elsewhere, quite the contrary, actually.  My son has chosen this movie more than once when he could have chosen any of a number of Pixar movies to watch just as easily.  This is great, because I really prefer his exposure to the stories of the Bible over the others (though I absolutely love most of the Pixar animated films!).At any rate, I highly recommend this as a children's movie, adult themes notwithsatnding.  That is, if your children are already being exposed to these stories, and you are looking for a way to bring them to life in animated form.  The big names involved do a professional job with the dialogue and the animation is actually quite good across most of the movie.",4,Solid Children's Entertainment and Bible History,1241308800,"05 3, 2009",2009,2683,"['have', '4-year', 'old', 'son', 'who', 'access', 'decent', 'library', 'animated', 'material', 'home', 'often', 'movie', 'have', 'owned', 'several', 'months', 'parent', 'like', 'pretty', 'closely', 'source', 'material', 'Bible', 'lacks', 'low', 'brow', 'humor', 'use', 'poor', 'language', 'something', 'many', 'children', 'movies', 'actually', 'include', 'lot', 'days', 'story', 'Moses', 'life', 'trip', 'river', 'basket', 'death', 'just', 'people', 'finally', 'enter', 'Promised', 'Land', 'Please', 'note', 'movie', 'geared', 'children', 'should', 'be', 'known', 'not', 'avoid', 'issues', 'Pharoah', 'issuing', 'command', 'kill', 'Israel', 'firstborn', 'children', 'Angel', 'Death', 'arrival', 'do', 'same', 'Egypt', 'children', 'attempted', 'murder', 'accidental', 'homicide', 'mass', 'drowning', 'other', 'things', 'children', 'are', 'being', 'exposed', 'stories', 'already', 'then', 'whole', 'thing', 'alive', 'together', 'well', 'are', ""n't"", 'sure', 'child', 'ready', 'themes', 'maybe', 'need', 'preview', 'are', 'interesting', 'reviews', 'floating', 'around', 'movie', 'More', 'few', 'reviews', 'have', 'read', 'online', 'seem', 'have', 'mentioned', 'computer', 'animation', 'was', 'sub-par', 'believe', 'due', 'weaker', 'character', 'designs', 'being', 'more', 'prominent', 'beginning', 'movie', 'childrens', 'are', 'really', 'not', 'strongest', 'are', ""n't"", 'prominant', 'figures', 'bulk', 'character', 'designs', 'are', 'good', 'great', 'genre', 'mean', 'exaggerated', 'features', 'rubbery', 'people', 'standard', 'even', 'Pixar', 'movie', 'stated', 'overwhelming', 'majority', 'top-notch', 'are', 'actually', 'quite', 'expressive', 'help', 'carry', 'story', 'places', 'backgrounds', 'are', 'excellent', 'are', 'well-executed', 'touches', 'realism', 'slaves', 'having', 'whip', 'marks', 'bodies', 'Really', 'not', 'quite', 'Pixar', 'offering', 'level', 'animation', 'not', 'cheap', 'god', 'awful', 'have', 'read', 'elsewhere', 'contrary', 'actually', 'My', 'son', 'chosen', 'movie', 'more', 'once', 'when', 'could', 'have', 'chosen', 'number', 'Pixar', 'movies', 'watch', 'just', 'easily', 'great', 'really', 'prefer', 'exposure', 'stories', 'Bible', 'others', 'absolutely', 'love', 'most', 'Pixar', 'animated', 'films', 'rate', 'highly', 'recommend', 'children', 'movie', 'adult', 'themes', 'notwithsatnding', 'children', 'are', 'already', 'being', 'exposed', 'stories', 'are', 'looking', 'way', 'bring', 'life', 'animated', 'form', 'big', 'names', 'involved', 'do', 'professional', 'job', 'dialogue', 'animation', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'most', 'movie']",N/A

The Prince of Egypt is a fantastic movie, even if it makes a few story changes from the biblical account. It ends after crossing the Red Sea, and this movie goes until the arrival at the promised land, but it is so poorly made that after seeing The Prince of Egypt, you can't bear to watch this. Another reviewer calls it ""claymation"". If only. It's very cheap computer animation, looking like something from one of those CD-ROMs for kids that came out in the 90s, or a Nintendo 64 video game. And the writing and voice acting are equally poor. I really can't believe that the famous actors listed in the credits were really part of this production.
