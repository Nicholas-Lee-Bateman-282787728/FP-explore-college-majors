1409870,A1IDHT7P50QRP9,B004HW7JNS,Adam Lenhardt,"[0, 0]","I loved the first season of this show, introducing us to Raylan Givens (certified BAMF) and the world of Harlan County, Kentucky. The second season, presented here on Blu-Ray, utilizes that groundwork to tell a overarching story from the first episode to the last. Among the wonderful characters introduced in ""Justified's"" second season, you'll meet clever, tenacious and intrepid young Loretta McCready and the warm, motherly and brutally conniving Mags Bennett, matriarch of Harlan's weed empire -- a role which snagged actress Margo Martindale an Emmy.The Blu-Ray features all thirteen episodes beautifully in 1080p high definition video and 5.1 DTS-HD sound. The second season was shot digitally using RED Epic cameras, so it should look flawless.. and does. If there's a disappointment with the set, it's that Sony has decided against including audio commentaries this time around. The first season had audio commentaries on four episodes.What makes up for it is a Blu-Ray exclusive special feature: ""Talking Shop: Roundtable Discussion"". It's a twenty-five minute conversation between showrunner Graham Yost, director Michael Dinner, staff writer Fred Golan and novelist Elmore Leonard, who created the character of Raylan in his 1993 novel ""Pronto"" and whose short story ""Fire in the Hole"" provided the basis for this series. The back and forth between the participants is really informative, as each brings a different perspective to the making of this show. Leonard, looking every bit his eight-plus years, is particularly valuable. He brings both the expertise of a writer and the outsider's perspective of an audience member, asking questions of the show makers that cut to the heart of adapting material from one medium to another. All four participants are curious people, and that makes what they have to say much more interesting that most fluff special features where the talking heads are just hitting the promotional talking points.",5,Like a 13-hour Elmore Leonard novel,1340409600,"06 23, 2012",2012,1951,"['loved', 'first', 'season', 'show', 'introducing', 'Raylan', 'Givens', 'certified', 'BAMF', 'world', 'Harlan', 'County', 'Kentucky', 'second', 'season', 'presented', 'here', 'Blu-Ray', 'groundwork', 'tell', 'overarching', 'story', 'first', 'episode', 'last', 'wonderful', 'characters', 'introduced', 'Justified', 'second', 'season', ""'ll"", 'meet', 'clever', 'tenacious', 'intrepid', 'young', 'Loretta', 'McCready', 'warm', 'motherly', 'brutally', 'conniving', 'Mags', 'Bennett', 'matriarch', 'Harlan', 'weed', 'empire', 'role', 'snagged', 'actress', 'Margo', 'Martindale', 'Emmy.The', 'Blu-Ray', 'thirteen', 'episodes', 'beautifully', '1080p', 'high', 'definition', 'video', '5.1', 'DTS-HD', 'sound', 'second', 'season', 'was', 'shot', 'digitally', 'using', 'RED', 'Epic', 'cameras', 'should', 'look', 'flawless..', 'disappointment', 'set', 'Sony', 'decided', 'including', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'time', 'around', 'first', 'season', 'had', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'four', 'episodes.What', 'up', 'Blu-Ray', 'exclusive', 'special', 'feature', 'Talking', 'Shop', 'Roundtable', 'Discussion', 'twenty-five', 'minute', 'conversation', 'showrunner', 'Graham', 'Yost', 'director', 'Michael', 'Dinner', 'staff', 'writer', 'Fred', 'Golan', 'novelist', 'Elmore', 'Leonard', 'who', 'created', 'character', 'Raylan', '1993', 'novel', 'Pronto', 'short', 'story', 'Fire', 'Hole', 'provided', 'basis', 'series', 'back', 'forth', 'participants', 'really', 'informative', 'different', 'perspective', 'making', 'show', 'Leonard', 'looking', 'bit', 'eight-plus', 'years', 'particularly', 'valuable', 'expertise', 'writer', 'outsider', 'perspective', 'audience', 'member', 'asking', 'questions', 'show', 'makers', 'cut', 'heart', 'adapting', 'material', 'one', 'medium', 'four', 'participants', 'are', 'curious', 'people', 'what', 'have', 'say', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'most', 'fluff', 'special', 'features', 'where', 'talking', 'heads', 'are', 'just', 'hitting', 'promotional', 'talking', 'points']",N/A

We enjoyed it so much we bought season two and have also bought season 3.  This series is entertaining with just the right balance of humor, violence, drama and realisim.  The adult content is appropriate without excessive profanity.  We wanted to love Deadwood, but couldn't get through the first episode due to the excessive and over-use of profanity.  This series holds your interest, makes you feel as though you know these characters personally, and never disappoints.  It has great acting both by the principle characters and the supporting cast.  Yes, it is violent at times, but Raylan is trying to bring some really bad people to justice and violence is a way of life for these people.  We are hooked on this series and have watched the complete series multiple times.  It is always entertaining and we catch things we have missed previously when we see it again.

1409880,A3IRBCCB3I5PPD,B004HW7JNS,"Anastasia McPherson ""Bibliophile""","[1, 1]","Justified Season One began as a police procedural centered on US Marshall Raylan Givens and his transfer in disgrace to his native Kentucky. Once there Raylan pursues friends and foes both old and new for the 21st century crimes of meth cooking and oxy dealing and the robberies and murders that go along with it.The success of Season One allowed Season Two to expand into a character study with a strong regional flavor. All of the stereotypes of Appalachia are here, but updated for the 21st century. People live in hollers, mine coal, make moonshine and music and hold blood feuds that last for decades. The strength of Justified is that the viewer believes these tropes and wants more.The Bennetts are a family of pot growers and organized criminals who manage the marijuana growing business in Harlan County and dabble in other crime when it overlaps with their marijuana business. Mags Bennett is the matriarch of the family and she rules all around her with an iron fist. The Bennetts and the Givenses have been feuding since the era or Prohibition and the revenuers but Mags and Raylan's Aunt Helen have kept the feud in check these past twenty years. Loretta lives with her widowed father who is growing pot without Mags's approval. Loretta is also pursued by a convicted paedeophile. Mags takes matters into her own hands and Raylan has to rescue Loretta from the molester. The story of this young girl and the feud between the Bennetts and the Givens fuels the entire season and it is rocket fuel.Also present is Raylan's old friend and foe, Boyd Crowder who is still struggling with his identity as an outlaw and his identity as a converted Christian whose conversion came to a bloody end in Season One. What Boyd chooses as his path and identity will affect everyone around him: the Bennets, Raylan, Loretta and Ava.This season of Justified is phenomenal. Even realizing that the regional flavor is stereotyped, it is this flavor that gives the show nostalgia and drive. Without it this would be just another show about an angry cop. With it, this is something brilliant. The characterizations are well-rounded and human and even the villains are affecting and lovable. The real problems of poverty and addiction aren't glossed over, nor are they presented ""poverty porn"" for the elite. Highly recommended.",5,Procedural Grows into Character Study with Regional Flavor,1325376000,"01 1, 2012",2012,2319,"['Justified', 'Season', 'One', 'began', 'police', 'procedural', 'centered', 'US', 'Marshall', 'Raylan', 'Givens', 'transfer', 'disgrace', 'native', 'Kentucky', 'Once', 'Raylan', 'friends', 'foes', 'old', 'new', '21st', 'century', 'crimes', 'meth', 'cooking', 'oxy', 'dealing', 'robberies', 'murders', 'go', 'along', 'it.The', 'success', 'Season', 'One', 'allowed', 'Season', 'Two', 'expand', 'character', 'study', 'strong', 'regional', 'flavor', 'stereotypes', 'Appalachia', 'are', 'here', 'updated', '21st', 'century', 'People', 'live', 'hollers', 'mine', 'coal', 'make', 'moonshine', 'music', 'hold', 'blood', 'feuds', 'last', 'decades', 'strength', 'Justified', 'viewer', 'tropes', 'more.The', 'Bennetts', 'are', 'family', 'pot', 'growers', 'organized', 'criminals', 'who', 'manage', 'marijuana', 'growing', 'business', 'Harlan', 'County', 'dabble', 'other', 'crime', 'when', 'marijuana', 'business', 'Mags', 'Bennett', 'matriarch', 'family', 'rules', 'iron', 'fist', 'Bennetts', 'Givenses', 'have', 'been', 'feuding', 'era', 'Prohibition', 'revenuers', 'Mags', 'Raylan', 'Aunt', 'Helen', 'have', 'kept', 'feud', 'check', 'past', 'twenty', 'years', 'Loretta', 'widowed', 'father', 'who', 'growing', 'pot', 'Mags', 'approval', 'Loretta', 'also', 'pursued', 'convicted', 'paedeophile', 'Mags', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'Raylan', 'rescue', 'Loretta', 'molester', 'story', 'young', 'girl', 'feud', 'Bennetts', 'Givens', 'entire', 'season', 'rocket', 'fuel.Also', 'present', 'Raylan', 'old', 'friend', 'foe', 'Boyd', 'Crowder', 'who', 'still', 'struggling', 'identity', 'outlaw', 'identity', 'converted', 'Christian', 'conversion', 'came', 'bloody', 'end', 'Season', 'One', 'What', 'Boyd', 'path', 'identity', 'will', 'affect', 'everyone', 'Bennets', 'Raylan', 'Loretta', 'Ava.This', 'season', 'Justified', 'phenomenal', 'Even', 'realizing', 'regional', 'flavor', 'stereotyped', 'flavor', 'show', 'nostalgia', 'drive', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'show', 'angry', 'cop', 'something', 'brilliant', 'characterizations', 'are', 'well-rounded', 'human', 'even', 'villains', 'are', 'affecting', 'lovable', 'real', 'problems', 'poverty', 'addiction', 'are', ""n't"", 'glossed', 'over', 'are', 'presented', 'poverty', 'porn', 'elite', 'Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

Timothy Olyphant is terrific as Raylan Givens, and even though he is what got me to watching this show, I have been very pleased to find that everyone else on the show is also terrific, and the writing is too.I don't like shows that make me hate every character. This show doesn't do that, even though it's filled to the brim with shady people. Each character is far from a perfect human being, but what I like is that they aren't one-dimensional. Nearly every character on this show manages to be likable in some way. The ones that really make my skin crawl are fascinating as opposed to simply repellent, and some others do such stupid things that I want to smack them. I'm looking at you, Winona. Walton Goggins gets a special mention for consistently delivering a nuanced, thoughtful, at times terrifying and yet strangely endearing performance as Boyd Crowder. But there isn't a single actor or actress on Justified who doesn't make me feel like I'm watching real people, as opposed to characters played by actors, doing the things that happen on the show.If you are thinking of watching the second season, watch the first season before getting there so you know where it came from. The first season is excellent once it gets going.

I ordered all three seasons on DVD. I was immediately taken with the series and the extraordinary chemistry that exists between Raylan and Boyd. Timothy Olyphant and Walton Goggins are amazing as they continue their dance between friend and enemy. They are able to portray volumes not only in what is said but in what remains unsaid. Glances, looks, grimaces and smiles all become tools and part of the repertoire of these consummate actors.  That being said this season belongs to, or more accurately is seized by Margo Martindale who literally owns the season. Martindale's well-deserved Emmy attests to the fact that it is impossible to take your eyes off her when she barks an order to her son ""Dole"" (Doyle) or screws the lid off her Mason jar to serve some ""apple pie."" She was named by New York magazine as ""One of the Eight Actors who Turn Television into Art.""  Mags Bennett along with her motley brood of Dickie, Doyle (the Bennett police officer), and Coover, run the major weed operation in the hollar and most of the state. From the first episode we realize that the Crowders, Bennetts, and Pa Givens have comprised a great deal of the underbelly of Harlan County. The clans exchange genteel conversation and gunfire without batting an eye. Thrown into this mix is Ava who oversees the town brothel which consists of a derelict trailer fitted with a set of 1960's hanging beaded curtains and a fan for ambiance. The ever naive and rather dim Ellen Mae, played by the wonderful Abby Miller, works her pelvis to the bone as the ""town whore"" all the while learning more secrets than she should. Nick Searcy as Chief Deputy U.S. Marshall Art Mullen secretly liking but all the while gruffly attempting to reign in the ""unreignable"" Raylan. Justified is the finest sort of ensemble acting, something seldom seen in television. It is funny, violent, and always with a great deal of heart. This is a rag tag bunch not only attempting to get by, but dedicated to advancing up the food chain by any means necessary. As someone who has limited experience in playwriting, and was fortunate to have my work produced. Nothing is a greater gift than to see a truly gifted actor put their soul Into the script and a group of writers who can deliver the same gift to the actors with consistency.

You see, I choose a favorite show about once in a decade, and Friday Night Lights has been mine. I was checking out Kyle Chandler's 2011 Emmy competition for Best Lead Actor in a Drama ... and 'Reckoning' was Timothy Olyphant's Emmy submission episode. (I watched ALL the Emmy submission episodes in the Lead Actor category.) Boy, was I pleasantly surprised ... not only by Olyphant's performance as Deputy Marshal Raylan Givens ... but the writing, pacing, and casting of Justified were spot on.As soon as Friday Night Lights aired its final episode, I went back and watched Seasons 1 and 2 of Justified. And now, I can't wait for Season 3 to air in January 2012.The show really found its stride in Season 2, capitalizing on the rich characters of Raylan and his cohorts at the Marshals' Service, and the resident hillbillies and thieves/criminals residing in Raylan's home town of Harlan, Kentucky. These characters are volatile, charming, ignorant, funny, authentic, and always justified in whatever they are involved. The story telling is superb, the locations, the music. This show is as well done for it's genre as Friday Night Lights was for its genre.Justified is a modern day cops and robbers show, set in the hollers of Eastern Kentucky. There are 100 year feuds and moonshine stills, crime families, and town halls vs. greedy mining companies. There is a pace and a place for each person in a town where even the criminals are polite Southerners. Everyone is packing heat and when meetings are held at the local church, the Pastor collects all the guns at the door to make sure the meetings are peaceful. When someone does fire a gun, they all fire their guns!Justified can be violent and people are killed on this show, often by Raylan, who is the fastest draw in the County and maybe in the region of the country. But it is not without humor, strategically placed, smartly written ... even when the 'knuckle headed hillbillies' run amok and create big problems for Raylan and the Marshal Service.

Now living in Australia, I wasn't aware of the new series Justified til I checked out clips on Youtube one day.  I had to have the 1st TV series and got that through Amazon.  I am now about half way through it and really like it.  It does bring back memories.  After coming home from Vietnam in 68, I joined a small city police department in central Connecticut.  All my late Father's family were from the Canadian Border area of Vermont.  I knew I had some cousins who were on the other side of the law up there.  When I would go up to that area of Vermont, I would notice conversations change when I walked into the room...becasue I was a cop.  I wasn't too long into watching that first episode of series one of Justified, when I started to see similarities between my own life's experiences in going back to a rural mountain area and that of Rayland Given's returning to his roots in Kentucky.  As my Father once said of his family...you have inlaws and outlaws, take your pick.  I worked many years at that police job before I migrated out here and joined the state police force in Tasmania, Australia, of which I am now retired.  I served over 32 years in the job here and ran into many circumstances like the Justified character did...with less gunplay I may ad.  Having been there and done that, I personally find it refreshing to see a police orientated TV series that isn't all New York or Las Vegas flash and dash with Gucci suits, but more down to earth country types in quite realistic situations.  I hope this series goes on for years.

Williams ""gareth37""","[10, 10]","As season one ended with a bloody gunfight, the second season picked up where we left Deputy US Marshal Raylan Givens and Boyd Crowder.  The relationship between these two men reminded me of the tumultuous friendship between Wyatt Earp and Doc Holiday.Givens and Crowder are cut from the same Kentucky cloth soiled by coal mining.  Their chosen paths would appear to make a friendship, an alliance almost impossible.However, from The Moonshine War to Bloody Harlan these two men argue, threaten each other but in the final analysis they have each other ""backs"" for good or for worse.  To me this is what makes this series intriguing.As well as good production values, riveting stories and plots, good solid acting, and  the introduction of the Bennett Clan with its strong-willed matriarch and her three sons made season two enjoyable.  You could not wait until the next week to see what was going to happen.The Given's and Bennett's blood feud added fodder to the ticking time bomb.  Sure enough, blood was spilt on both sides as the season progressed.  When you tossed in the Crowder Clan who favored the Givens, you had a mountain still ready to blow.""Apple pie"" of Mags Bennett was a running theme from episode one to its ultimate climax in episode thirteen.  In this case apple pie was distilled moonshine with a kick, sometimes lethal.The relationship of Givens with his ex-wife, Winona Hawkins, took some twists and turns.  She becomes a target from an unexpected source.One of the best episodes was Blaze of Glory.  Chief Deputy Art Mullen gets to tangle with an old nemesis who is just as cunning, but is slower.  The chase scene between Art and Frank Reasoner at the airport is priceless.US Deputy Marshal Rachel Brooks is showcased in For Blood or Money.  When her brother-in-law breaks parole to see his son, she and the team goes after him.  Of course there is a shoot-out, but there's a twist and surprise.Each episode had its special moments.  Reckoning is sad, but it leads into Bloody Harlan, the season finale.  It was better than last season's Bulletville.Great second season with some threads hanging for closure in Season Three.  And what of Boyd and Raylan?  I am sure that they will face new challenges, especially with the mysterious stranger and some leftover business with the remaining Bennett clan, and let's not forget the Miami cartel who wants both Boyd and Raylan dead.For in the hills of Kentucky family feuds are never settled by a few deaths.

The exploits of Elmore Leonard's character U.S. Marshal Raylan Givens in his home town of Harlan in Kentucky proved that strong writing and dialogue can drive a show just as much (if not better than) non-stop action and gunfights. Justified's second season continues this trend, and while I think it falters a bit it proves to be just as engaging and watchable as the first run.This second season of Justified picks up where the first season left off cleaning up the aftermath of a shoot-out between Raylan, the Crowder crime family and Miami gun-thugs. The story then shifts introducing the new characters of the Bennett family, a ruthless pot-dealing and moonshining clan who may be trying to take over from the Crowders (and who have a deep, violent history with Raylan's family). We also follow reformed(?) outlaw Boyd Crowder, who's now a regular character and ends up getting mixed up with the Bennetts himself. As with first season things play out episodically at first, slowly building up the main plot and then letting things take off in the last five episodes. The action is well-filmed and there's still plenty of gunfights but it's really the dialogue, character development and Kentrucky setting that makes Justified stand out from the rest of the crime shows on TV.The acting was one of Justified's strong points during its' first season and it's even better this time around! Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Raylan and this time giving him much more vulnerability as a man who has more to lose than just his job. Walton Goggins is equally good as Boyd, an anti-hero whose consistantly questioning his place in life. While the series regulars have never been better it's Margo Martindale and Jeremy Davies as Mags and Dickie Bennett who hold your attention and give us understandable, yet threatening villains.As much as I liked the overall story of this season of Justified I think it dragged itself down with repetitious subplots (involving Raylan's ex-wife Winona and a few too many stops at Mag's store) and a consistently dark tone. The first season of Justified was able to offset it's seriousness with moments of light-humor and charm (much like Elmore Leonard's stories) and while it's nice to see Raylan's NOT the invincible gunfighter he thinks he is, each episode kept getting more intense and the situations more serious. I'm sure this makes the show more interesting for the usual crime-series fan, I just hope Justified doesn't lose it's identity in the process.While I have a few minor complaints (anyone else think Raylan let Boyd and Arlo off the hook a bit too easily?), this second season of Justified is still a must-see and establishes the show as one of the more original crime dramas currently running on TV.",4,A strong second season,1325980800,"01 8, 2012",2012,2836,"['first', 'season', 'FX', 'Justified', 'breathed', 'fresh', 'air', 'tired', 'TV', 'crime', 'genre', 'exploits', 'Elmore', 'Leonard', 'character', 'U.S', 'Marshal', 'Raylan', 'Givens', 'home', 'town', 'Harlan', 'Kentucky', 'proved', 'strong', 'writing', 'dialogue', 'can', 'drive', 'show', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'not', 'better', 'non-stop', 'action', 'gunfights', 'Justified', 'second', 'season', 'trend', 'think', 'bit', 'be', 'just', 'engaging', 'watchable', 'first', 'run.This', 'second', 'season', 'Justified', 'up', 'where', 'first', 'season', 'left', 'off', 'cleaning', 'up', 'aftermath', 'shoot-out', 'Raylan', 'Crowder', 'crime', 'family', 'Miami', 'gun-thugs', 'story', 'then', 'introducing', 'new', 'characters', 'Bennett', 'family', 'ruthless', 'pot-dealing', 'moonshining', 'clan', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'trying', 'take', 'over', 'Crowders', 'who', 'have', 'deep', 'violent', 'history', 'Raylan', 'family', 'also', 'follow', 'reformed', 'outlaw', 'Boyd', 'Crowder', 'who', 'now', 'regular', 'character', 'up', 'getting', 'mixed', 'Bennetts', 'first', 'season', 'things', 'play', 'out', 'episodically', 'first', 'slowly', 'building', 'up', 'main', 'plot', 'then', 'letting', 'things', 'take', 'off', 'last', 'five', 'episodes', 'action', 'well-filmed', 'still', 'plenty', 'gunfights', 'really', 'dialogue', 'character', 'development', 'Kentrucky', 'setting', 'Justified', 'stand', 'out', 'rest', 'crime', 'TV.The', 'acting', 'was', 'one', 'Justified', 'strong', 'points', 'first', 'season', 'even', 'better', 'time', 'Timothy', 'Olyphant', 'excellent', 'Raylan', 'time', 'giving', 'much', 'more', 'vulnerability', 'man', 'who', 'more', 'lose', 'just', 'job', 'Walton', 'Goggins', 'equally', 'good', 'Boyd', 'anti-hero', 'consistantly', 'questioning', 'place', 'life', 'series', 'regulars', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'Margo', 'Martindale', 'Jeremy', 'Davies', 'Mags', 'Dickie', 'Bennett', 'who', 'hold', 'attention', 'give', 'understandable', 'yet', 'threatening', 'villains.As', 'much', 'liked', 'overall', 'story', 'season', 'Justified', 'think', 'dragged', 'down', 'repetitious', 'subplots', 'involving', 'Raylan', 'ex-wife', 'Winona', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'stops', 'Mag', 'store', 'consistently', 'dark', 'tone', 'first', 'season', 'Justified', 'was', 'able', 'offset', 'seriousness', 'moments', 'light-humor', 'charm', 'much', 'Elmore', 'Leonard', 'stories', 'nice', 'see', 'Raylan', 'NOT', 'invincible', 'gunfighter', 'episode', 'kept', 'getting', 'more', 'intense', 'situations', 'more', 'serious', ""'m"", 'sure', 'show', 'more', 'interesting', 'usual', 'crime-series', 'fan', 'just', 'hope', 'Justified', ""n't"", 'lose', 'identity', 'process.While', 'have', 'few', 'minor', 'complaints', 'anyone', 'else', 'think', 'Raylan', 'let', 'Boyd', 'Arlo', 'hook', 'bit', 'too', 'easily', 'second', 'season', 'Justified', 'still', 'must-see', 'show', 'one', 'more', 'original', 'crime', 'dramas', 'currently', 'running', 'TV']",N/A

Being from a ""flyover"" state, I am pleased to watch a drama that does not take place in New York, Boston, Chicago, or LA; where Hollywood would have you believe the entire 300 million people of the American population has been shoehorned into.  How about a unique location once in a while, Hollywood?Timothy Oliphant is great as the main protagonist, a real hardass but not some invincible tough guy.  The characters are well drawn out human beings with believable motives and eccentricities.  One thing I have very much enjoyed is the dark path of Raylan's on again off again frenemy Boyd Crowder.  Rival?  Ally? Enemy?  It's always a concern where the reformed white supremist and nominal head of the Crowder Crime family is going to land.  You like Boyd, you root for him, but he can be such a ruthless prick you wouldn't be surprized to see him end up the Don Corelone of the hayseeds.From the opening credits score _Long Hard Times to Come_ by Gangstagrass (thankfully downloadable from iTunes!) to the epilogue, I can hardly wait to see what is going to happen in JUSTIFIED's world of rural families, white trash crime, and back country rivalries and grudges.  Raylan Givens is one of Elmore Leonard's best characters.I liked Timothy Oliphant in _Deadwood_, but he really shines as the quick drawing, no nonsense Federal Marshall whose unbending commitment to principle dooms him to assignment in a Federal backwater hometown he struggled so hard to leave.  Never predictable but sometimes darkly inevitable and always filled with wry, sparkling dialogue.  No character is safe from a bad end if realism dictates it should be so.Elmore Leonard's stories have a distinct style and flavor.  _Justified's_ producers live by the mantra: WHAT WOULD ELMORE DO? and it shows.

For me it just was'nt that great. It started out bumpy in a couple of different ways. One of the things I liked least was that each episode wrapped up a case from start to finish in a neat little bow. It lacked depth and focused more on Ray's cases he was assigned to instead of his personal relationships with the rest of the cast. For me something was missing, but as the season neared the end I thought it gained it's footing and I decided to stick with it because with a cast such as this it was bound to go places. I usually enjoy FX's series and sure enough when Season Two began we had the show I had wanted all along. This season starts out great and it never drags. Each episode is exciting and much different in that we don't focus on Ray's cases so much, but more on his everyday life. There are alot of different plots and subplots, each one explored and carried into the next week's show. The entire series feels more developed and put together. The viewer gets to meet so many interesting folks in Harland County and the characters come alive. The acting is great, Timothy Olyphant as the lead is awesome. I have always loved him since watching him in Deadwood as the town's sherriff. There is alot of intrigue for such a small town and we get to see how hard life is in a town who's industry is coal and not much else. We also get to understand how deeply family and home town ties can hold us.

Its a major understatement to accuse him of typecasting. Basically he was sent into the future to play the role of rogue US marshall Raylan Givens. Raylan is literally the same uncorruptible person with that stiff 'Clint Eastwood' swagger as Seth Bollock.Only this time he is supported by a much less engaging cast. Not that they are particularly horrible. Waltin Goggins as Boyd and Margo Martindale as Maggs are highlights of the show, but there are many average characters that become labrorious to watch and difficult to care about.Unfortunately I dont think 'Justified' is golden era Tv. With shows like 'Breaking Bad', ""The Wire', 'Dexter', 'Oz', 'Game of Thrones' and 'Deadwood' developing plotlines and arch lines that span seasons, the weekly dose of 'new case new problem' entertainment on 'Justified' feels too static in comparison. A bit too 'Chuck Norris Texas Rangerish'. I expect more having watched 2 seasons in now. But what has really changed since raylan's first episode. Not a whole lot. The fact that Raylan's father tried to kill his son is soapy in the way 'bold and the beautiful' deals with family feud. The impact lasts one episode. The impact should have been huge. This is the core issue to what is flawed about 'Justified'.SPOILERThe worst thing about 'Justified' is that for all its kick-assery it really doesnt have the balls to kill main characters. Not really. It can kill characters it introduces for one season but it really irked me when Ava got shot in the chest (apparently no one dies when they get shot in the chest BTW). If I compare this to some of the cliffhanger season finales in my time.... it doesnt even come close.And maybe Im just too experienced in the way of Tv drama and thats my fault but there are moments where Im just killing time watching this show. You know you've seen it before, you've watched the same tension building, the same drama unfolding, the same lines spoken. The moment Loretta decides to steal a gun and go look for Maggs, I knew exactly how that was going to play out.

Many people say this is a Golden Age of television because of the numerous incredible series which have been developed over the last few years (arguably started, or at least solidified, by HBO's ""Sopranos"").  ""Justified"" based on stories by Elmore Leonard is one of those series which supports that argument.George Will, a huge Elmore Leonard fan, once wrote about the 1988 novel ""Freaky Deaky"" that all you had to do was walk into a bookstore and pick up a copy of the book and read the first chapter.  He noted that no bookstore employee will bother you because they know that when you finished you were a guaranteed sale.  This is absolutely true.  The same holds true for ""Justified,""  just watch the first ten minutes of the first season and you will be hooked.Read the other hundreds of positive reviews to get plot summaries.  All I can add about the second season that I particularly enjoyed was the development of Walton Goggins' character Boyd Crowder.  Crowder started off the first season as a dangerous neo-nazi.  As the first season progressed and definitely into the second season, that persona was whitewashed and Crowder becomes a likable character, pretty much an anti-hero.  Walton Goggins reminds me of a young Peter Weller and I look forward to seeing how his career develops.Great show.",5,Great Stories - Hard to Imagine This Getting Better,1355097600,"12 10, 2012",2012,1422,"['Everything', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'series', 'already', 'been', 'said', 'really', 'one', 'best', 'things', 'TV', 'Many', 'people', 'say', 'Golden', 'Age', 'television', 'numerous', 'incredible', 'series', 'have', 'been', 'developed', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'arguably', 'started', 'least', 'solidified', 'HBO', 'Sopranos', 'Justified', 'based', 'stories', 'Elmore', 'Leonard', 'one', 'series', 'argument.George', 'Will', 'huge', 'Elmore', 'Leonard', 'fan', 'once', 'wrote', '1988', 'novel', 'Freaky', 'Deaky', 'had', 'do', 'was', 'walk', 'bookstore', 'pick', 'up', 'copy', 'book', 'read', 'first', 'chapter', 'noted', 'bookstore', 'employee', 'will', 'bother', 'know', 'when', 'finished', 'were', 'guaranteed', 'sale', 'absolutely', 'true', 'same', 'true', 'Justified', 'just', 'watch', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'first', 'season', 'will', 'be', 'hooked.Read', 'other', 'hundreds', 'positive', 'reviews', 'get', 'plot', 'summaries', 'can', 'add', 'second', 'season', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'development', 'Walton', 'Goggins', 'character', 'Boyd', 'Crowder', 'Crowder', 'started', 'off', 'first', 'season', 'dangerous', 'neo-nazi', 'first', 'season', 'progressed', 'definitely', 'second', 'season', 'persona', 'was', 'whitewashed', 'Crowder', 'likable', 'character', 'pretty', 'much', 'anti-hero', 'Walton', 'Goggins', 'young', 'Peter', 'Weller', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'how', 'career', 'develops.Great', 'show']",N/A

There are some instances of film grain and a little bit of detail loss in indoor scenes, but over all the video on this set is almost perfect.Audio-DTS-MA encoded in 5.1. Generally the show is dialog driven so the center speaker gets the biggest work out on this one. As with the last season, they do use the rear channels but they are used quite sparingly to my ears. You get a lot of ambient sound through the rears, but it's not jaw dropping.Sounds very good, and much better than when I watched it as it aired.Extras-As with many extras for shows and movies, there are spoilers to be found in these extras. You may want to wait until you've watched through the entire series before hitting these up. If you watched it as it aired or re-ran or On Demand, then feel free to peruse the extras to your heart's content.Extras include behind the scenes, on location of the set for the show where they show you the Disney Ranch and how they go about making this set look like Harlan County. You also have a round table discussion (supposedly a Blu Ray only extra) where Graham Yost and the directors talk about the show, some deleted scenes, outtakes and Graham Yost talking about why the show seems to spend so much time with the ""bad guys.""Very good stuff and a great addition to a great show.Packaging-3 Blu Ray discs in an double wide case with 2 discs on a hinge in the center. Cover artwork is nice and the rear has a hand full of screen shots from the show.

I was relieved to see the 5 stars were for the show itself and the 1 stars had nothing to do with the show but were complaints about the video quality several viewers had with Amazon. Those 1 stars don't belong with ratings of the show itself; should probably be addressed directly to Amazon.Having gotten that off my chest, I agree with the other 5 star raters that this is an authentic, very well acted show. It's a given (no pun intended) that Timothy Olyphant is, as always, a charismatic actor to watch, but every actor on this show gives great performances. The stories and the performances are all seamless and I'm always surprised that an episode has ended because they are so mesmerizing it doesn't seem like much time has passed.

I absolutely love the acting . The amazing cinematography . Every thought that passes your main characters faces are right there. A lot of depth in the writing but as I stated,  it can be quite violent. The whole premise of  coal and Kentucky and the more modern day ""bandits"" is strongly created here. Moonshine, ""grass"" and pills fuel numerous gang types who are squabbling for their piece of the action. Timothy  Olyphant  who plays Raylan Givens has created a character of strength and interest but I think that Walton Goggins  is even more interesting while playing Boyd Crowder.  Boyd is a man of many, many extremes. Violent, loving, dangerous and intense. He vacillates  between good and bad with joyous abandon .  Goggins acting is wonderful to watch and with this sort of filming, you get to see each thought crossing his face.All your main characters are well fleshed out and you become interested in what trouble each one will get into next.  Mags Bennet portrayed by Margo Martindale is wonderful. What a mountain matriarch !  She holds her family of screw up boys in an iron fist and a sandpaper tongue.  Everything about this show is character driven and probably the reason I look forward to it each week.

1410125,ALV3JTIVURZLY,B004HW7JNS,"Travis Haselton ""men are like steel they lose...","[2, 5]","The second season of Justified was more shocking and mind blowing than the first. Timothy Olyphant has gone into much more depth of this character than I think Elmore Leonard has. On top of that, there is Walter Goggins as Boyde Crowder who is the amazing badguy that you kind of root for. Normally when there are badguys your root for like this, he has some sort of good to his agenda, but not Boyde!!! Part of you wants him to run all the crime in Harland County Kentucky. on top of that, there is a slew of new characters, Mags Bennet (crime boss, and weed giant of Harlan County) and her boys, particularly Dickie Bennett. The whole season I just wanted someone to shoot him, and though it almost happened a couple times, it never did. But hey, that is cool 'cause that's what makes me want to watch the next episode, the hope that Dickie may get shot someday.Rayon's relationship his ex wife Wynona gets pretty heated after her and her husband agree to divorce. Then of course the subject that got her and Raylon to split in the first place comes up, and it pretty much revolves around Raylon never being sure if he is going to come home alive from day to day.One of the more interesting episodes is where Wynona manages to steal a bunch of money from the evidence locker, and Raylon plays hell getting it back, this causes Rayon's relationship with his boss Art to be real edgy. It almost makes a guy cry as we all have learned to love Art.Mag Bennett ends up giving all but the weed business to Boyd Crowder. Boyd shacks up with Ava, gets Arlo (Rayon's dad) in on stealing the weed business from Mags, Dickie gets mad because he was the one running it for her, goes to Arlo's house wanting to ""talk"" to him. Arlo is not there, but Rayon's beloved aunt Helen is with a shotgun, unfortunately she doesn't have the advantage and gets shot at point blank range with a 12 gauge. I dispute the shows illustration of it, though it was very suspenseful showing a shot from outside the house, you hear her make a gasp and then she gets a shot out, though this is possible, I do not feal it would have been likely considering the weapons used, but hey is was very well played out and definitely made me make sure I didn't miss the next episode.Next Raylon gets a chance to kill Dickie, but gets all choked up and doesn't want to be the badguy and just sends him to jail. By this point Raylon has thwarted assassins that were gunning for Wynona and makes her ex disappear.The last episode, really started to have the feel of the old Gunsmoke show, Marshall Dylan (Raylon Givens) sees it his civic duty even though he is on vacation, to help a little girl who is out for the blood of her fathers death. In his attempts to find where the girl is, he gets knocked out with a baseball bat, when he wakes, he is tied up and hanging upside down in a tree. Salty Sam (Dickie Bennett) starts to monologue about how Marshall Dylan owes him for crippling him twenty years ago. Then eventually gets around to beating him with the bat a few times. Then the bad guy we love to hate, The Rango Kid (Boyde Crowder) comes in with a witty thing to say like, ""I don't know whether to just shoot him now or let him hit you a couple more times."" Oh but Marshall Dylan even in his pain is more witty and says, ""I vote the first one."" So Rango gets him cut down and proceeds to shoot Salty Sam, yay!!!!!!!!!! I thought. No, that doesn't happen, Salty Sam has  silver tongue, he mentions the fact that Marshall Dylan needs him to get to the Bennets place and save the girl.So Marshall Dylan takes Salty and holds him at gun point in front of The Bennett clans place in front of their numerous guys with machine guns, and says I need to get in there. The little girl has beat him to it, and fires a shot witch makes everyone outside start shooting at Marshall Dylan. This is the twist, normally Marshall Dylan save the day, no this time the bullets completely miss Salty (damn it!!!!!) and Dylan gets gut shot. Just when his chips are down and Salty's big brother has Dylan at point blank range, a sharpshooter hits the big brother in the head, it seems Marshall Dylan's friend with the Marshall's service caught wind of his situation and came to help, thanks to miss Kitty (Wynona).Oh and in the end Mags Bennett kills herself with the same arsenic type poison she tends to put in her apple pie flavored moonshine to kill other people.All in all I completely enjoy this series and season two delivered, yeah the people I liked got killed and the ones I hate seem to like, but that's what keeps it interesting.

1410130,A3KXV8AFQ550DY,B004HW7JNS,Wayne C. Rogers,"[0, 0]","This is a BIG SPOILER ALERT!  Just so you know in advance, I'm going to be giving some surprises away to entice more interest in people who haven't seen Season 2 of Justified.  Make it interesting enough and they'll go out and buy the DVD set.  So, you may not want to read further.First, let me just say it's been a long year waiting for Justified: Season 2 to come out on DVD.  Because of how late the show comes on at night, I was forced to miss it when the second season aired on television in 2011.  I had to be satisfied with tidbits of information on the Internet about the cast and individual episodes dealing with Raylan Givens and his relationships with the Bennett clan and with Boyd Crowder.  I especially read such wonderful things about Margo Martindale who won an Emmy Award for her performance as Mags Bennett, the head of the clan.  Well, Season Two is now out on DVD, and I was finally able to watch it over a three-day period in a mad raced to find out the whole scoop on my favorite U.S. Marshal, Raylan Givens.Okay, was Season 2 worth the long twelve-month wait and was all the praised given to it actually true?Damn right it was!The first episode of Season 2 begins right where Season 1 left off with Boyd Crowder (played by the great Walton Goggins--yeah, this actor is great in my book and is definitely headed for big things in movie and TV business) going after the daughter of the man who runs the Southern Florida drug cartel...the woman who murdered Boyd's daddy.  He finds her during a rain storm before she can kill an innocent man.  As he's getting ready to get his revenge, guess who shows up?  Yep.  Raylan Givens unexpectedly appears behind Boyd, ready to kill any and everyone who moves, if he has to.  He somehow manages to talk Boyd down so he can use the daughter for his own purposes, which is to return her back to Florida and to tell her father that all the bloodshed stops now.  That's when Raylan's former boss from the U.S. Marshal's Service in Miami appears on the scene and tells the head honcho that if anything happens to Raylan in Kentucky, he will personally come back and kill him.  Matt Craven plays Raylan's previous boss with relish and authenticity.  You believe him when he makes a threat.  I only wish Matt Craven had a more active role in the series, but then again his character is stationed in Miami and Raylan is in Kentucky.Of course, the Bennett clan is introduced in this episode,  You get to meet Dickie Bennett (played by Jeremy Davies from Saving Private Ryan) and Coover Bennett (played by Brad Henke) and the magnificent Margo Martindale who plays the matriarch of the Bennett clan, Mags.  Mags seems like a sweet and lovable woman when you first meet her, but she can turn into a riled up rattlesnake faster than a blink of an eye.  She has no compunction about killing people who upset her or get in her way.  The Bennett clan also has a long history of bad blood between them and the Givens clan that goes back a hundred years.  They literally hate each other, though some hate it better than others.  As we later find out, Dickie attempted to take Raylan out when they were kids playing baseball.  Raylan, however, got the last swing in with a bat and Dickie never walked right again.  Dickie still holds a grudge against Raylan for that incident even though it was him who started it.  Anyway, now that the power of the Crowder family has been broken, the Bennett clan decides to step in and take over the drug business.  They're going to be Raylan's main adversaries for the entire season.This is what you can look forward to and this is where the SPOILER ALERT comes into play.The Bennetts kill old-man McCready because he called the police about a sexual pervert who's after his young daughter, Loretta.  What McCready doesn't know is that the pervert is already working for the Bennett family.  After Raylan captures the pervert, the Bennetts are upset with McCready and pay him a number of visits to demonstrate their displeasure by torturing and then poisoning him.  They explain that he should have come to them first before going outside the community for help.  Once McCready is dead, Mags Bennett takes Loretta into the family to care for her like she was her own daughter.  Loretta doesn't know about her daddy being dead, but that realization will come in time.Boyd Crowder is trying to live a decent, honest life by working at the coal mines and staying alone when in the local bar drinking.  He doesn't want any company.  Boyd is also renting a room from Ava Crowder, Raylan's old girlfriend and the former wife of Boyd's dead brother.  As we know from Season 1, Ava killed Boyd's brother in self-defense with a shotgun.Raylan and his former wife, Winona, are basically living together in his motel room.  Her husband, Gary (played by William Ragsdale of Fright Night fame) doesn't like it and soon puts a contract out on Raylan, wanting him permanently out of the way so he can get back with his wife.  Winona, however, doesn't want Gary back.  She wants Raylan.  Winona also wants Raylan to have a safer job so she doesn't have to worry about him being killed from day to day.As the season progresses, some bad guys lull Boyd back into a life of crime.  He has the last laugh on them when they attempt to kill him after the robbery has gone down.Winona then steals $200,000 dollars from the U.S. Marshal's vault in a moment of weakness and pretty much begs Raylan to help her put it back, which he does at great risk to himself and his career.  His boss, Art Mullen, suspects something is up and tells Raylan that he's had his fill of him.  He states that Raylan is damn fine lawman, but a terrible Marshal.  He's tired of cleaning his mess and eventually wants to get rid of him.  That doesn't make Raylan too happy.While all of the above is going on, the company that owns the coal mine wants to buy the entire mountain from the folks in Harlan County.  Boyd, despite his past, is hired to protect the lady who has the make the deal happen.  Let's face it, Boyd is as smart and crafty as Raylan, and he soon decides to get himself involved in some of the big money that's coming down the pike.  He also wants to have a more intimate relationship with Ava, who responds to his overtures.One thing then leads to another and none of it is what you think.  Before long, Boyd makes the rough decision to take over the Bennett's criminal business with the help of Raylan's father.  This causes repercussions and Raylan's aunt Helen is soon murdered.  It's now an all out war.  Raylan and Boyd are taking no prisoners as they go after the Bennett clan.  This is about the time Loretta discovers what happened to her daddy and pays Mags Bennett a visit with a .38 pistol in her backpack.Now, everything I've discussed is a rough outline of Season 2 and is really just the tip of the iceberg with regards to everything that goes on.All the performers are excellent from the lead, Timothy Olyphant, who is Raylan Givens in every way possible, to his counterpart of Walton Goggins.  There can't be a Raylan Givens without a Boyd Crowder to work off one another.  They are really two sides of the same coin.Nick Searcy brings off the character of Art Mullen with sheer panache, admiring Raylan on one level, but disliking him on another.  In many ways, it's the character of Art as the head of the U.S. Marshal's Service in Lexington who bring what humor there is into the show.The characters of Tim Gutterson (played by Jacob Pitts) and Rachel Brooks (played by Erica Tazel) are given more to do in Season 2 as the other two U.S. Marshals in the Kentucky office.  Because they have to kill a couple of bad guys in the show, Art now feels that Raylan is having an adverse affect upon them.  In other words, they're picking up Raylan's bad habits of shooting people.  That's another reason Art wants him out of the field office.Joelle Carter as Ava Crowder and Natalie Zea as Winona Hawkins show how tough and resilient Kentucky women are.  Ava takes a bullet for Boyd and Winona gets pregnant by Raylan.  I don't know which of the two is worse....being pregnant or shot.The new folks in Season 2 certainly raise the ante with their brilliant performances.  Margo Martindale definitely shines as Mags Bennett.  She can also bellow out a tune with the best of them.  Jeremy Davies plays the crippled Dickie Bennett, the middle child with the least respect in the family.  Jeremy has Dickie's character down pat and makes him come alive in all of his meanness and sadness at not being loved by his mother.  Joseph Lyle Taylor as Doyle Bennett probably has the most unappreciative role in the show, yet also one of the most important.  There's both good and bad in him.  The fact is he loves his family and tries to do what's best for them, playing both sides of the law to achieve his goals.  Brad William Henke as Coover (for the first several episodes, I thought he was being called Guber) is the only one brave enough to go up against Raylan hand-to-hand.  It doesn't hurt that he's about 6'4"" and weighs 300 pounds.  And, we know how Raylan is, don't we?  He doesn't care.  You can see that Coover's just itching to have a go at the U.S. Marshal and does before the season is over with.Last, but not least, is Kaitlyn Dover as fourteen-year-old Loretta McCready.  This young lady does a fantastic job of displaying the conflicting emotions that fill her at no longer having a mother, the lost of her daddy, and the compelling desire to get revenge.  In the mountains of Kentucky, blood is everything and revenge is one of the rules the people live by.  Kaitlyn makes Loretta live and breathe in ways that make you care for her and understand her need to kill those who hurt her family.Justified is one of the best police dramas on television today.  It's been described as a western that takes place in modern times and Raylan Givens as a lawman who dispenses his own brand of hard justice.  Though most of the show was filmed in either Pennsylvania or California, the locations are great stand-ins for Kentucky.  The performances by all the actors are top notch, the direction is right on, and the writing makes author Elmore Leonard smile.You see the series is based on the character created by author Elmore Leonard.  Raylan Givens is a U.S. Marshal who first appeared in the novels Pronto and Riding the Rap, plus the short story, Fire in the Hole.  Justified is one of the few adaptations from his work that gets it right for a change, and Elmore Leonard is tickled pink by it.  In fact, his newest novel, Raylan, has Timothy Olyphant on the cover with his white hat and Sig Sauer 9mm pistol.The Behind-the-Scenes extras are okay.  You get a couple of commentaries, a look at the new characters and the actors portraying them, and a sit down with Graham Yost, who created the series.  I wish there had been more stuff about the show.  Maybe it was saved for the Blu-Ray edition.Justified is in the Top Three shows playing on television now.  The series will one day be a classic.  If you like police dramas with stellar acting, lots of action, and a wry sense of humor, this is for you.  Highly recommended!",5,One of the best shows on television today!!!,1327276800,"01 23, 2012",2012,11194,"['BIG', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'Just', 'know', 'advance', ""'m"", 'going', 'be', 'giving',

Boyd (Walter Goggins), Raylan's one time friend and some time nemesis, disappears after helping Raylan in a shoot out. Raylan gets caught in the middle of a war over coal with Boyd on one side representing a mining company and ""Mags"" Bennett (Margo Martindale who won a much deserved Emmy for her performance as Best Supporting Actress)the local matriach and drug queen pin of the area trying to get as much money for herself for the coal buried in the mountain they live in in Harlan County.The second season of ""Justified"" is as involving as the first with strong performances and an outstanding supporting cast. The writing by co-producer, creator (based on a pair of Elmore Leonard novels and a story) Graham Youst and his staff and directors like Adam Arkin, Tony Goldwyn and Jon Avnet is outstanding.The Blu-ray version of ""Justified"" looks exceptionally good with deep, solid blacks, color and detail that look exceptionally good. Flesh tones look quite natural. The show doesn't suffer from any over processing and looks quite nice.Audio sounds marvelous with a very active lossless presentation with a 5.1 surround mix.Subtitles are an option for this title.The extras are quite nice although they aren't quite as extensive as the first season but extremely good. We get deleted scenes for a variety of episodes on each disc.Featurettes include ""Clans, Feuds & Apple Pie"", ""On the Set"" and ""Talking Shop"". The first focuses on the season long story arc involving Mags and her brood running just under 25 minutes. ""On the Set"" let's us see the various sets, designs used for the show and runs around 20 minutes. ""Talking Shop"" a roundtable discussion that allows Youst, Leonard and others to discuss their writing and their favorite shows (this is exclusive to the Blu-ray). We also get a presentation of outtakes.The second season of ""Justified"" continues the exceptional quality of the first season.Highly recommendedI am a bit disappointed we didn't get any commentary tracks for the opening episode or the last of the season.",5,"""Am I going to the doctor or the rodeo?""-2nd season of ""Justified"" Blu-ray review",1325548800,"01 3, 2012",2012,2164,"['When', 'last', 'left', 'Marshal', 'Raylan', 'Givens', 'Timothy', 'Olyphant', 'was', 'facing', 'two', 'thugs', 'worked', 'drug', 'lord', 'wanting', 'revenge', 'Boyd', 'Walter', 'Goggins', 'Raylan', 'one', 'time', 'friend', 'time', 'nemesis', 'disappears', 'helping', 'Raylan', 'shoot', 'out', 'Raylan', 'caught', 'middle', 'war', 'coal', 'Boyd', 'one', 'side', 'representing', 'mining', 'company', 'Mags', 'Bennett', 'Margo', 'Martindale', 'who', 'won', 'much', 'deserved', 'Emmy', 'performance', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'local', 'matriach', 'drug', 'queen', 'pin', 'area', 'trying', 'get', 'as', 'much', 'money', 'herself', 'coal', 'buried', 'mountain', 'live', 'Harlan', 'County.The', 'second', 'season', 'Justified', 'as', 'involving', 'first', 'strong', 'performances', 'outstanding', 'supporting', 'cast', 'writing', 'co-producer', 'creator', 'based', 'pair', 'Elmore', 'Leonard', 'novels', 'story', 'Graham', 'Youst', 'staff', 'directors', 'Adam', 'Arkin', 'Tony', 'Goldwyn', 'Jon', 'Avnet', 'outstanding.The', 'Blu-ray', 'version', 'Justified', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'deep', 'solid', 'blacks', 'color', 'detail', 'look', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'Flesh', 'tones', 'look', 'quite', 'natural', 'show', ""n't"", 'suffer', 'processing', 'quite', 'nice.Audio', 'sounds', 'marvelous', 'very', 'active', 'lossless', 'presentation', '5.1', 'surround', 'mix.Subtitles', 'are', 'option', 'title.The', 'extras', 'are', 'quite', 'nice', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'extensive', 'first', 'season', 'extremely', 'good', 'get', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'variety', 'episodes', 'disc.Featurettes', 'include', 'Clans', 'Feuds', 'Apple', 'Pie', 'Set', 'Talking', 'Shop', 'first', 'season', 'long', 'story', 'arc', 'involving', 'Mags', 'brood', 'running', 'just', '25', 'minutes', 'Set', 'let', 'see', 'various', 'sets', 'designs', 'used', 'show', 'around', '20', 'minutes', 'Talking', 'Shop', 'roundtable', 'discussion', 'Youst', 'Leonard', 'others', 'discuss', 'writing', 'favorite', 'shows', 'exclusive', 'Blu-ray', 'also', 'get', 'presentation', 'outtakes.The', 'second', 'season', 'Justified', 'exceptional', 'quality', 'first', 'season.Highly', 'recommendedI', 'am', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'opening', 'episode', 'last', 'season']",N/A

The relationship between Olyphant and Searcey is hysterical.  The ongoing simmering animosity between Raylon and Boyd is interesting.  They don't like each other particularly, but out of some sense of loyalty they do defend each other.Really, the whole cast is great for the most part. In my opinion, the actors do handle their parts well.  I watched the special features at the end and I think one of the reasons why this series is so good is the directors.  They are so laid back and humble.  Unlike the director/writer of Deadwood, whose ego is 5 oceans wide, I didn't see that in the interviews with Justified's directors/producers.I anxiously await season 3....then season 4.
