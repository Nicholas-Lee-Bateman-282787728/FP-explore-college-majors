Of particular interest is the plot's patient development of the relationship between Crawford and Palance, an intricate bond that continues to intrigue as the harmony of their home begins to ring hollow.

She doesn't feel that the craggy Palance has the proper matinee idol looks for the role.  She soon after embarks on a transcontinental train headed for her home town of San Francisco, when she unexpectedly bumps into none other but Palance.Palance turns on the charm and woos Crawford and they fall in love and marry.  Though acting as the perfect husband, conniving deceit surfaces through Palance's transparent veneer when he encounters ex-girlfriend Irene played by the lispy Gloria Grahame.  They still are in love and plot to do away with Crawford before she can sign her updated will which will provide only a relative pittance for Palance.Palance and Grahame discuss a scheme to kill Crawford by an accident, in her office and are unwittingly recorded by her dictation machine which was left on.  Crawford learns of the plot and with her calculating mind devises a strategy to save herself and murder Palance while implicating Grahame.Although her plan seems infallible she can't go through with it but the co-conspirators get their just desserts regardless.David Miller's apt direction and stark black and white cinematography are bolstered by the Elmer Bernstein musical score to create a gripping film noir thriller.",5,A sterling Crawford thriller,1130889600,"11 2, 2005",2005,1569,"['Joan', 'Crawford', 'richly', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'garnered', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'performance', 'wealthy', 'heiress', 'celebrated', 'playwright', 'Myra', 'Hudson', 'taut', 'suspenseful', 'Sudden', 'Fear', '.Crawford', 'monitoring', 'previews', 'latest', 'Broadway', 'play', 'fires', 'leading', 'man', 'Lester', 'Blaine', 'played', 'also', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'Jack', 'Palance', ""n't"", 'feel', 'craggy', 'Palance', 'proper', 'matinee', 'idol', 'role', 'soon', 'embarks', 'transcontinental', 'train', 'headed', 'home', 'town', 'San', 'Francisco', 'when', 'unexpectedly', 'bumps', 'none', 'other', 'Palance.Palance', 'charm', 'woos', 'Crawford', 'fall', 'love', 'marry', 'Though', 'acting', 'perfect', 'husband', 'conniving', 'deceit', 'surfaces', 'Palance', 'transparent', 'veneer', 'when', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Irene', 'played', 'lispy', 'Gloria', 'Grahame', 'still', 'are', 'love', 'plot', 'do', 'away', 'Crawford', 'can', 'sign', 'updated', 'will', 'will', 'provide', 'only', 'relative', 'pittance', 'Palance.Palance', 'Grahame', 'discuss', 'scheme', 'kill', 'Crawford', 'accident', 'office', 'are', 'unwittingly', 'recorded', 'dictation', 'machine', 'was', 'left', 'Crawford', 'plot', 'calculating', 'mind', 'strategy', 'save', 'murder', 'Palance', 'implicating', 'Grahame.Although', 'plan', 'infallible', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'co-conspirators', 'get', 'just', 'desserts', 'regardless.David', 'Miller', 'apt', 'direction', 'stark', 'black', 'white', 'cinematography', 'are', 'bolstered', 'Elmer', 'Bernstein', 'musical', 'score', 'create', 'gripping', 'film', 'noir', 'thriller']",Sudden Fear VHS

Sullivan ""mondoego""","[6, 17]","Can anyone who watches this movie ever erase from their mind the scene where Crawford finds out Palance and Grahame are plotting to kill her and  goes stark, raving mad? It an Olympian display of overacting that has never  been equalled: Crawford pulls at her hair, wildly darts her unfocused,  bulging eyes, clamps her ears shut, pulls tight her grimacing mouth.  A  lunatic chimpanzee receiving electroshock couldn't do justice to Crawford's  facial contortions here.  I guess the reason that Crawford is such a  fascinating screen presence to fans and nonfans alike is that she's a  relentless masochist. In movie after movie, no matter what terrible fate  befalls her, no matter how many times she is betrayed, it's nothing  compared to the mental punishments she visits upon herself.

One of the first Joan films I have ever seen(way back in 99/2000),it still remains one of her best!If I had to choose(from the titles I have seen/own),A Woman's Face,Sudden fear,Mildred,Dancing Lady,The Women.First off, some side notes...By 1952,Joan had terminated her contract with Warners after some less than mediocre assignments. For the first time in her long career, she became a freelance artist. She found the script at RKO,and ultimatly doubled up as actress and producer. Joan also took less money up front and more percentage from the potential(big)box office. When the film became a huge hit,it help revive her fortunes as well as her 3rd oscar nod.Incidently, Joan INSISTED on Marlon Brando for the role of husband from hell ""lester Blaine"" Apparenly she hounded him a few times, and after she sent him the script, she recieved a note stating he ""isn't interested in doing any mother-son pictures at this time"" HARSH! I'm sure Joan reached for the 80 proof when she got that one!In this film,Joan plays""Myra(Can't remember the last name)"" a older playright/hieress.Only in Joan's world can someone be both a playright AND an heiress! One a cross country train trip Myra encounters an actor she recently fired from one of her play's""lester Blaine(the wonderful Jack Palance in his movie debut)"". Of course they get to talking and romance blossoms(sigh).Upon the new couple's return to San fransico, all is right with the world and Joan is feeling ""very gay"" due to her impending engagement...THE DICTAPHONES SECRET;Myra keeps a BIG ASS dictaphone in her study for the purpose of recording anything she needs to apparently. One morning after a party, Myra turns it on and to her SUDDEN FEAR, she encounters a plot by her new HUBBY to kill her during the thin window before her new will bequests the majority of her vast estate to charity,,,Instead of a NORMAL person whom take the recording to the police, Joan attempts to hie it and BREAKS IT!Joan realizes she must take it upon herself to save her own life! Ergo,Joan world becomes a crazy mix of paranoia,hallucinations, and nightmares. Some of joans acting in the nightmare sequences is pretty hokey, but excluding this, her acting can't be topped!Again, as in 'A Womans Face"" in the crucial third act, Joan is required to emote bec she is hiding in a closet from lester,,,This is one of the best sequences of the film and is beautifully shot,,,There is alot of tension in this film after Myra's discovery(obviously)...and the viewer never forgets Joan MASTERED the requisite talent harking back to her silent days.... Another highlight is when Joan(earlier in the film-pretending she knows nothing) sickenly sweetly proclaims to lester,""I don't know what i did to deserve you...""After she turns her back to him,,,,you can REALLY see what is going on in her head,,,,,but the brilliance is how quickly, severly, and convincingly her mood changes,,,One of course can only expect this from truly great talent....Also worth mentioning is the excellent Gloria Graham(as Irene the other woman unbeknowst to Joan) whom was making a name for herself in gritty,hardboiled tough guy films... her comments to joan after joan'sprains"" her ankle are quite snarky and fun!

You see, she done him wrong at an earlier date. Now it's retribution time. But who is outdoing whom? Twists abound. Joan Crawford (Oscar nominated) and Jack Palance (his first Oscar nomination) are excellent. The cast also includes Gloria Grahame, Bruce Bennett, Virginia Huston and Touch (Mike) Connors. The effective Black and White cinematography is by Charles Lang (also Oscar nominated). This film also boasts one of Elmer Bernstein's earliest scores. Bernstein has been a leading writer of film scores since the mid-1950s, when his work on THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN ARM (1955) and THE TEN COMMANDMENTS (1956) elevated him into the front rank of Hollywood composers. His score for THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN (1960) made him immortal and launched him into a string of successful Western scores through that decade.

Almost singlehandly she manages to provide the movie with many moments of unbearable suspense though the directon is not too shabby. The director David Miller uses light and shadows to provide a good, tension filled atmosphere and Gloria Grahame,in a performance for which she was nomintated as best supporting actress, also supplies great support and she is defintley a highlight. Jack Palance is very menacing in this movie and he also manages to do a good job. The script is not that original though and ultimatly the script is the problem with the movie. And before i forget the story is about a playwright named Myra Hudson(Joan Crawford) who marries the actor she fired from her play(Jack Palance). She then discovers a plot that has been concocted between her husband and his lover( Gloria Grahame) to kill her for her money. Then she comes up with a plot to kill them instead.

I have just a few comments to add.Since DVDs have arrived and video has become a stepchild, we have an excellent opportunity to view old favorites with little impact on the purse.  Sometimes a visit to old haunts proves our memory a little faulty or shows the film itself just hasn't aged well.I loved this movie that first time around and it proved to be just as wonderful in a recent memory lane visit.Joan Crawford, never one of my favorite actresses, deserved the Oscar for this performance, not just a nomination.  It was definitely one of her best.  She was able to convey the 'fear' without making one groan at any overacting.  She portrayed a bright woman with a fear, a plan, a conscious, and a heart with  brilliance and with just the right amount of conviction.Jack Palance, conversely always a favorite of mine, was his menacing best in this performance without having to overact for a second.  The perfect role, played to perfection.It is always enjoyable to see the work of stars you have forgotten were in favorite old films.  Touch (Mike) Conners (TV's Mannix) played Sonny in this film, which didn't rumble back into memory when I watched him each week on TV, but I recognized his name in the opening credits immediately this time. It was very interesting to watch him in retrospect in an early effort (perhaps his first?).Hollywood in their infinite wisdom seems to have decided that today's audiences are too jaded, too sophisticated, too juvenile, or too something to enjoy a simple thriller in the ilk of 'Sudden Fear', 'Midnight Lace', or other great 'woman-in-distress/woman-with-a-plan films, unless they modern-it-up as in 'Panic Room'.  Perhaps they know a thing or two, since they are wealthy and I work a 9-to-5 job and post reviews on a website.However, speaking for myself, and hopefully for other viewers who still enjoy; a simple plot with character-study, suspense, b/w beauty, and pleasure while viewing, 'Sudden Fear' tells a great story in a suspenseful manner.

The first film she chose to undertake was ""Sudden Fear"" based on a famous novel by Edna Sherry that she very sensibly optioned and saw as a perfect showcase for her by now mature talents as an actress. ""Sudden Fear"", offered Crawford a terrific and most welcome change of pace from her last largely lacklustre efforts at Warners such as ""Goodbye My Fancy"", and ""This Woman is Dangerous"", and could be seen as the next installment in the continual redevelopment and redirection that Joan seemed to undertake careerwise at roughly 10 year intervals and the end result was truly remarable here. Providing Joan with her third well deserved Academy Award Nomination ""Sudden Fear"", gave her the perfect transitional role into the more assertive characters she undertook through the 1950's and never has she been a more dynamic presence on screen than here where within the course of the action she evolves from potential victim to the one pulling the strings in a complex tale of cat and mouse intrigue and murder. Crawford for once in her mature career has a vehicle worthy of her talents and is tremendously aided by a wonderful script that contains nail biting suspense, melodrama, murder, and interesting characterisations by the supporting cast.After Joan Crawford's career slump in the late 1940's ""Sudden Fear"" proved to be a big success at the Box Office and certainly helped pave the way for the many ""take charge"", characters that became her trademark from then on. Joan Crawford plays Myra Hudson a wealthy and highly successful playwright who as the story begins we find in a dilemma over what she feels is a wrong choice of actor. Feeling that actor Lester Blaine (Jack Palance) is definately not the type of leading man she had in mind she gets him fired from the production. Thinking that that is the end of the situation the play eventually opens to great acclaim however when Myra travels alone on the train to the West Coast for the plays opening there she encounters Lester again on the train and very soon a  quite unexpected romance springs up between the former adversaries. After a whirlwind courtship Myra marries Lester and the pair settle down to domestic life in her San Francisco mansion. However Myra's happiness is short lived when by accident she overhears a conversation that was recorded on her copying machine between Lester Blaine and his old girlfriend Irene Neves (Gloria Grahame). Having heard that Myra intends to donate most of her fortune to charities Lester's real intent comes out and is unfortunately captured unbeknownst to him and Irene on Myra's tape. The pair intend to murder Myra before she gives away her fortune with Lester then inheriting her entire fortune after which he will marry the wily Irene. Overcoming her initial panic and heartwrending sense of betrayal by Lester, Myra composes herself and utilizing her playwright's experience and imagination begins to concoct and then put into action an involved and utterly fascinating sequence of events to outwit the would be murderers at their own deadly game. Secretly fearing her devious husband but trying not to show her true feelings Myra continues to play the loving wife while putting her plan into action. Over the course of one evening Myra manages to evade being alone with Lester by pretending to be sick and leaves the house to set in motion her plan to frame Lester and get rid of Irene into the bargain. All does not go exactly as Myra plans however and she has to endure a terrifying pursuit by Lester through the deserted late night streets of San Francisco before a case of mistaken identity and a matching fur coat and scarf makes Lester believe he is just about to run down Myra in his car when in fact he is mistaken. The conclusion sees tragedy of a different kind result but which sees a shaken Myra able to walk away from the situation to a new life without her menacing husband.There are those that dismiss ""Sudden fear"", as a ""camp"", thriller however I feel it has its genuine moments of nail biting suspense that gives it its own corner in the noir thriller genre. Joan Crawford of course dominates the proceedings and her development of her character from trusting middle aged wife into first class schemer equal to her devious husband is a great achievement. Through much of the climax of the story once Myra puts her plan into execution Crawford uses her hugely expressive eyes to great effect which is best illustrated in the scene when she breaks into Gloria Grahame's apartment and is almost caught by her husband and has to hide in the closet. Crawford here is superb in conveying much of her feeling and emotions with very minimal dialogue. It's hard to imagine now but Crawford campaigned heavily for long time costar Clark Gable to play the role of Lester however the younger Jack Palance is perfect for this role ( he was also Oscar nominated here) as the younger man being supported by his wealthy older wife and his very distinctive looks make him an ideal villian in the story. He actually works very well with Joan Crawford despite their reported off screen lack of chemistry. Perrenial bad girl Gloria Grahame is superb in her role of Lester's trouble making old girlfriend out for a larger slice of the pie and prepared to murder for it. Grahame's distinctive speaking voice and hard exterior also add much to the role and she is perfectly deceitful in her scenes where she supposedly is being a new friend to the older Myra while secretly plotting her death. Grahame was so effective in the role that she too was rightly nominated for an Academy Award for her performance. Director David Miller gets well rounded performances from what is essentially a three character study in ""Sudden Fear"" with the emphasis being on things not really being what they appear to be with any of these three main characters. Miller's direction of Joan Crawford in particular is especially effective and he manages throughout the story to keep her character just on the edge of potential tragedy then in the next instance brings the character full circle so that she is again in control of the stories proceedings. Another of the strong selling points of ""Sudden Fear"" is its beautiful look with the strong elements of black and white light and shade courtesy of gifted cinematographer Oscar nominated Charles Lang, greatly enhancing the films look and feel and it works superbly in the moments of high tension such as Lester's pursuit of Myra through darkened streets lit only by dim far off lamp lights. Along with the superb lighting the great use of many San Francisco locations for the exterior shots also adds greatly to the films overall look.""Sudden Fear"", is one of my favourite later Joan Crawford vehicles and despite losing the Oscar that year I feel she was most deserving of a second nod after her earlier win in ""Mildred Pierce"". I can't say that Jack Palance is really a favourite actor of mine but I feel he made ideal casting here and ""Sudden Fear"", really helped in setting him along in the successful career he had later on. Joan Crawford I always find a terrific performer and too often she seems to be relegated into the ""camp"", school of acting by critics and public alike. Here she does have a character worthy of her considerable and often underrated talents and she makes the most of it in ""Sudden Fear"". For all lovers of suspense and nail biting tension ""Sudden fear"", makes a great addition to any film collection and is an important film to look at when seeking to understand the enduring popularity of movie legend Joan Crawford.",4,Joan Crawford Oscar Nominated In Late Career Classic Thriller Role,1127779200,"09 27, 2005",2005,7825,"['ending', '1940', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'contract', 'due',

But I am not saying she can't be good- despite the nutty scene where she finds out that Palance plans to off her (where she does everything but juggle while spinning her head around a la Linda Blair in &quot;The Exorcist&quot;), she's good in this one.

388569,A2Q457CES5ZUZ,6303918468,William Hare,"[6, 7]","Joan Crawford achieved one of her greatest performances in the 1952 suspense classic ""Sudden Fear.""  In the manner of so many great Hollywood classics, this film overcame an initial major hurdle when, after the film's director, David Miller, following dinner and discussion with the great actress, was reportedly told to leave in the most emotional terms by Crawford.The basis for Crawford's strong creative disagreement with Miller, and what would be a pivotal element of the project, was Miller's belief that film newcomer Jack Palance would be ideal for her leading man.  As proof of his point, Miller had brought along a film for Crawford to watch after dinner, which was Palance's debut, ""Panic in the Streets.""  After viewing the film Crawford mistakenly believed that Miller had either Richard Widmark or Paul Douglas, longstanding film professionals, in mind to play opposite her, and was insulted when Miller suggested newcomer Palance.  Crawford reportedly also was turned off by Palance's appearance.Miller finally got Crawford to see things his way and the rest is cinema history as both the great leading lady and Palance received deserving Oscar nominations for their brilliant performances.  Miller was shrewd enough to realize that an offbeat, terrifying looking leading man was just the antidote for Crawford, who therefore could appear vulnerable as was required by the exigencies of the story.  The fascinating element about Crawford in this film is that she appears appropriately terrified, forging an entirely different persona from the assertive executive female type she normally played who was in full command of her agenda.The early phase of the film has a ""life imitates art"" aspect when Crawford, as Myra Hudson, a successful playwright, rejects actor Lester Blaine, played by Palance, for the lead in her Broadway play because he does not look appropriately romantic enough to play as leading man.  He angrily tells her before leaving the theater that he looks exactly like that legendary lover of old, Cassanova.After Crawford's play opens to smashing reviews in New York she returns to her home in San Francisco, meeting Palance again as they are traveling on the same train.  The second meeting between them becomes so supercharged with emotion that Palance abandons plans to stop in Chicago, where a new job offer beckons, traveling instead to San Francisco with Crawford.Myra Hudson comes from old San Francisco wealth.  This along with her rich play royalties make her an enticing catch for the opportunistic Palance, who in time proves he more than looks like Cassanova.  Before long the successful socialite and playwright becomes Mrs. Lester Blaine.At that point Palance's old romantic flame from New York, Gloria Grahame, enters the scene.  They then plot to kill Crawford for her money.  Crawford learns about their plot when it turns up on her dictating machine, unknown to the plotters.The story then enters a uniquely fascinating phase as Crawford seeks to use her playwright's imagination to concoct a scenario wherein the Palance-Grahame team will fail in their attempt and she will survive.  Many of the scenes contain little or no dialogue, with Crawford's expressive eyes revealed with haunting conviction as they register alternately sadness over being betrayed by someone to whom she gave her heart and fear over being killed by the ruthless team of Palance and Grahame, who are tough-willed and make it plain they will stop at nothing to achieve their objective of wealth at Crawford's expense.In addition to pulsating drama, viewers are also treated to the beautiful scenery of San Francisco, which is captured magnificently by the camera's all-seeing eye.",5,Crawford in Brilliant Form,1025740800,"07 4, 2002",2002,3707,"['Joan', 'Crawford', 'achieved', 'one', 'greatest', 'performances', '1952', 'suspense', 'classic', 'Sudden', 'Fear', 'manner', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'Hollywood', 'classics', 'film', 'initial', 'major', 'hurdle', 'when', 'film', 'director', 'David', 'Miller', 'following', 'dinner', 'discussion', 'great', 'actress', 'was', 'reportedly', 'told', 'leave', 'most', 'emotional', 'terms', 'Crawford.The', 'basis', 'Crawford', 'strong', 'creative', 'disagreement', 'Miller', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'pivotal', 'element', 'project', 'was', 'Miller', 'belief', 'film', 'newcomer', 'Jack', 'Palance', 'would', 'be', 'ideal', 'leading', 'man', 'proof', 'point', 'Miller', 'had', 'brought', 'along', 'film', 'Crawford', 'watch', 'dinner', 'was', 'Palance', 'debut', 'Panic', 'Streets', 'viewing', 'film', 'Crawford', 'mistakenly', 'believed', 'Miller', 'had', 'Richard', 'Widmark', 'Paul', 'Douglas', 'longstanding', 'film', 'professionals', 'mind', 'play', 'opposite', 'was', 'insulted', 'when', 'Miller', 'suggested', 'newcomer', 'Palance', 'Crawford', 'reportedly', 'also', 'was', 'turned', 'off', 'Palance', 'appearance.Miller', 'finally', 'got', 'Crawford', 'see', 'things', 'way', 'rest', 'cinema', 'history', 'great', 'leading', 'lady', 'Palance', 'received', 'deserving', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'Miller', 'was', 'shrewd', 'enough', 'realize', 'offbeat', 'terrifying', 'looking', 'leading', 'man', 'was', 'just', 'antidote', 'Crawford', 'who', 'therefore', 'could', 'appear', 'vulnerable', 'was', 'required', 'exigencies', 'story', 'fascinating', 'element', 'Crawford', 'film', 'appropriately', 'terrified', 'forging', 'entirely', 'different', 'persona', 'assertive', 'executive', 'female', 'type', 'normally', 'played', 'who', 'was', 'full', 'command', 'agenda.The', 'early', 'phase', 'film', 'life', 'imitates', 'art', 'aspect', 'when', 'Crawford', 'Myra', 'Hudson', 'successful', 'playwright', 'actor', 'Lester', 'Blaine', 'played', 'Palance', 'lead', 'Broadway', 'play', 'not', 'look', 'appropriately', 'romantic', 'enough', 'play', 'leading', 'man', 'angrily', 'leaving', 'theater', 'exactly', 'legendary', 'lover', 'old', 'Cassanova.After', 'Crawford', 'play', 'smashing', 'reviews', 'New', 'York', 'home', 'San', 'Francisco', 'meeting', 'Palance', 'again', 'are', 'traveling', 'same', 'train', 'second', 'meeting', 'so', 'supercharged', 'emotion', 'Palance', 'abandons', 'stop', 'Chicago', 'where', 'new', 'job', 'offer', 'beckons', 'traveling', 'instead', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Crawford.Myra', 'Hudson', 'old', 'San', 'Francisco', 'wealth', 'rich', 'play', 'royalties', 'make', 'enticing', 'catch', 'opportunistic', 'Palance', 'who', 'time', 'more', 'Cassanova', 'long', 'successful', 'socialite', 'playwright', 'becomes', 'Mrs.', 'Lester', 'Blaine.At', 'point', 'Palance', 'old', 'romantic', 'flame', 'New', 'York', 'Gloria', 'Grahame', 'scene', 'then', 'plot', 'kill', 'Crawford', 'money', 'Crawford', 'plot', 'when', 'up', 'dictating', 'machine', 'unknown', 'plotters.The', 'story', 'then', 'uniquely', 'fascinating', 'phase', 'Crawford', 'use', 'playwright', 'imagination', 'concoct', 'scenario', 'Palance-Grahame', 'team', 'will', 'fail', 'attempt', 'will', 'survive', 'Many', 'scenes', 'contain', 'little', 'dialogue', 'Crawford', 'expressive', 'eyes', 'revealed', 'haunting', 'conviction', 'register', 'alternately', 'sadness', 'being', 'betrayed', 'someone', 'whom', 'gave', 'heart', 'fear', 'being', 'killed', 'ruthless', 'team', 'Palance', 'Grahame', 'who', 'are', 'tough-willed', 'make', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'achieve', 'objective', 'wealth', 'Crawford', 'expense.In', 'addition', 'pulsating', 'drama', 'viewers', 'are', 'also', 'treated', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'San', 'Francisco', 'captured', 'magnificently', 'camera', 'all-seeing', 'eye']",Sudden Fear VHS
