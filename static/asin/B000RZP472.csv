It has found the perfect interpreter in Quenia, who dances with dazzling speed, strength and control. What Baryshnikov is to ballet, Quenia is to samba.  Watch her and be amazed!After Quenia and her Grupo Ribeiro give us a ""Welcome,"" Quenia shows us some ""Basic Steps,"" and then we get a terrific ""Warm-up,"" which is slow and powerful. We next move to the ""Workouts:""In ""Workout #1"" Quenia shows us a set of steps, repeats them and then adds on the next set of steps, until we have a lengthy combination that gives new meaning to the word aerobic. Quenia says it's ""a great way to exercise and burn calories,"" and have lots of fun too! If you don't have the necessary natural abilities (sense of rhythm, agility, etc.), muscular strength and tip top aerobic conditioning you may have trouble keeping up, but do what you can, and enjoy it.In ""Workout #2"" the pace is picked up, and it's continuous, with the kind of energy that would leave some of our million dollar athletes panting in the dust. After the ""Workouts,"" we meet the fabulous 5 man Grupo Ribeiro led by Nick Birmelin and dancers Ana and Nao.Quenia is one of the most dynamic performers you'll ever see, and she will motivate you to try this fire-in-the-soul/fire-in-the-soles-of-the-feet dancing, expand your horizons, and learn from the best.

However, if you are looking for something fun, challenging and different, this is definitely it. This is definitely designed to be more of a workout than Quenia Ribeiro's Samba DVD.It begins with an excellent warm up and stretch routine. Then Quenia moves into the choreographed routine that provides a challenging cardio workout. She's great at going over the moves and layering so that you are ready to build and move on to the next part of the routine. The live drummers are a fantastic addition as you feel as though you are in an African/Brazilian dance class. Everyone seems to be genuinely having a good time doing the routine, which makes the DVD even more fun and engaging. My only concern would be the knees. You have to make sure not to go overboard on some of the more advanced movements because you can definitely injure your knees on this one.

1084626,A231KSL42Z60CQ,B000RZP472,Melissa McKenzie,"[6, 6]","I've been a runner for a few years and recently suffered an ankle injury that has kept me sidelined for the last couple of months.  I've been rehabbing it and I thought I would try this workout to test the strength of my ankle.  Honestly, it was a little rough with the jumping and twisting.  I can only imagine how bad it would be for someone with knee or hip problems.  If you don't have any of those three issues, you shouldn't have a problem.I also have zero dancing ability so some of the hip shaking, isolation and arm movements when put together were a little confusing.  This is only the second dance workout I've done (the first was The Grind with Eric Neis so you have an idea of how long it's been).  I still think it's for beginners though.  I've always thought the point of a workout was to be somewhat challenging and it was.You need more space than I have available.  There is a lot of traveling and some kicking so make sure you move the coffee table and couches out of the way (especially if you live in an apartment like I do).All of that being said, I really enjoyed it.  My heart rate was up and I was sweating.  There are short breaks while you're learning the next step so you have a little bit of time to catch your breath, but make sure you walk through the new steps with her because it's easy to get lost when the movements speed up again.I hope to start running in the next month or so, but I can definitely see myself tossing this DVD in once or twice a week.  It would probably get boring if you did it 5x a week, but I don't see it getting stale if it's part of a rotation.  It's fun - not quite a 5 star workout, and I would have given it a 3 because of my ankle, but I can't blame her for that so I gave it a very strong 4 stars.",4,"Super fun, but not for people with ankle, knee or hip problems",1252108800,"09 5, 2009",2009,1761,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'runner', 'few', 'years', 'recently', 'suffered', 'ankle', 'injury', 'kept', 'sidelined', 'last', 'couple', 'months', ""'ve"", 'been', 'rehabbing', 'thought', 'would', 'try', 'workout', 'test', 'strength', 'ankle', 'Honestly', 'was', 'little', 'rough', 'jumping', 'twisting', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'how', 'bad', 'would', 'be', 'someone', 'knee', 'hip', 'problems', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'three', 'issues', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem.I', 'also', 'have', 'zero', 'dancing', 'ability', 'so', 'hip', 'shaking', 'isolation', 'arm', 'movements', 'when', 'put', 'together', 'were', 'little', 'confusing', 'only', 'second', 'dance', 'workout', ""'ve"", 'done', 'first', 'was', 'Grind', 'Eric', 'Neis', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'long', 'been', 'still', 'think', 'beginners', ""'ve"", 'always', 'thought', 'point', 'workout', 'was', 'be', 'somewhat', 'challenging', 'was.You', 'need', 'more', 'space', 'have', 'available', 'lot', 'traveling', 'kicking', 'so', 'make', 'sure', 'move', 'coffee', 'table', 'way', 'especially', 'live', 'apartment', 'do', '.All', 'being', 'said', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'My', 'heart', 'rate', 'was', 'up', 'was', 'sweating', 'are', 'short', 'breaks', ""'re"", 'learning', 'next', 'step', 'so', 'have', 'little', 'bit', 'time', 'catch', 'breath', 'make', 'sure', 'walk', 'new', 'steps', 'easy', 'get', 'lost', 'when', 'movements', 'speed', 'up', 'again.I', 'hope', 'start', 'running', 'next', 'month', 'so', 'can', 'definitely', 'see', 'tossing', 'DVD', 'once', 'twice', 'week', 'would', 'probably', 'get', 'boring', 'did', '5x', 'week', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'getting', 'stale', 'part', 'rotation', 'fun', 'not', 'quite', '5', 'star', 'workout', 'would', 'have', 'given', '3', 'ankle', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'so', 'gave', 'very', 'strong', '4', 'stars']","The Samba Reggae Workout, with Quenia Ribeiro: Samba dance fitness classes, Samba dance instruction, Dance fitness cardio workout"

This program is well worth above its price.This program begins with a good thorough warm up session targeting important muscle groups necessary for this intense dance.Initially Quenia breaks down the basic steps for samba reggae and their variations. This footwork is fast paced. The choreography is lengthy as it is being layed out but when set to the drumming, it will go by rather quickly. The two sessions set you at different paces, so take your pick.The first segment is about 44 minutes, the second is shorter as it is quicker. As you begin and gather speed, the second session is really fun. There is ample repetition and the segments are easy to learn. Set at slow speed and work up to your potential.Quenia introduces her band and her dancers, as the band does a phenomenal percussion number. Personally I love drum circles, and listening to this distinct drumming does get your mood going.I would categorize this as a cardio work out, although it is at times high impact aerobic and excellent at that. If I were looking to find fault, the drumming was really distracting in the background during the warm up, the instructor sounded like she was yelling out the drill.

That she presents her workout against the backdrop of a live band and others who seem to enjoy the music and dance makes this DVD stand out in its genre.  My quibbles with this DVD are that she does not seem to be wired and it is not always easy to hear her over the live music.  She gives good instruction but it's not always easy to hear what she is saying.This DVD presents a deceptively challenging workout.

She ends the workout, but not before changing into a RED bodysuit!  That's when it gets real... and you better have the routine down because she isn't waiting for you.  She leads you through the entire routine no instructions, just move it!  I burned 700 calories doing the entire routine and I had a ball learning moves from Bahia...She loses count once during transition, but quickly regains her composure.  I think this is a great workout if you are a quick study and love to dance to the rhythm of the samba playing.",4,"Danando, Danando, Danando",1361664000,"02 24, 2013",2013,727,"['bought', 'DVD', 'love', 'dance', ""'m"", 'fascinated', 'Afro-Brazilian', 'culture', 'dance.Quenia', 'girls', 'warm', 'up', 'then', 'lead', 'step', 'step', 'movements', 'Samba', 'Reggae', 'Workout', 'workout', 'not', 'changing', 'RED', 'bodysuit', 'when', 'real', 'better', 'have', 'routine', 'down', ""n't"", 'waiting', 'entire', 'routine', 'instructions', 'just', 'move', 'burned', '700', 'calories', 'doing', 'entire', 'routine', 'had', 'ball', 'learning', 'moves', 'Bahia', 'count', 'once', 'transition', 'quickly', 'composure', 'think', 'great', 'workout', 'are', 'quick', 'study', 'love', 'dance', 'rhythm', 'samba', 'playing']","The Samba Reggae Workout, with Quenia Ribeiro: Samba dance fitness classes, Samba dance instruction, Dance fitness cardio workout"

If that describes you as well, don't think you can't do this workout!  Just adapt it to your needs: When she jumps, do a step instead.  This DVD is very much worth getting, even if you look nothing like the person on the cover of it.  (In truth, SHE doesn't look much like that person either, it must be heavily photoshopped.  In my opinion, the real her looks a lot better than the cover image.)The music is great, the drums make it so lively! I have two left feet, so I got confused a lot (I've only done it for the first time today), but it's very much worth it.

Quenia is a great fluid, graceful dancer w/body awareness & has a great, fun, friendly, patient personality, great cues & teaching & the two backup dancers also have fun dancing which is important.You learn 1 type of samba step & many other traditional Latin dance moves that are fun to do.Intro: 2 minBasic Dance Step/Learn the beat: 3 minWarm-up: 12 min - Some great stretching, lunges, ab work, neck stretching, rib, hip stretching & circles, etc.Workout 1/Teaching Segment: 37 min - Quenia w/2 backup dancers teaches you a move in 1/4 time, even turning her body so you can see it from the side when necessary, making sure you move out your body, and even though there are 2 dancers behind her, she calls out YOUR left/right. Once she's done with instruction, she shows it in 1/2 time, then has you practice a few times, then at slightly slower then normal latin tempo, but a good speed for beginners since this is new to you. Once you learn another move, she has you practice that, then the move before-hand so you can feel the link, then from the top to build a routine. It's a great pace to keep you moving so you're never bored.Workout 2/Very Fast/More Jump/Hoping: 5 min - Here you do the routine several times w/everyone jumping higher, adding more hops, and moving at breakneck speed like most Latin dances do.There is no cool down, she introduces the band/dancers after.This routine involves a good amount of hopping, but you can always make it more low-impact & still do it easily like in the workout 1 section. This is not ballroom style.Trailer (shows almost all the dances in the routine you learn) at youtube under ""The Samba Reggae Workout :: Quenia Ribeiro ::"" or also at the website: worlddancenewyork com",5,Great latin dance routine & perfect instruction/pace,1247011200,"07 8, 2009",2009,1865,"['great', 'dance', 'workout', 'w/Quenia', 'Ribeiro', 'two', 'great', 'female', 'backup', 'dancers', 'live', 'percussion', 'band', 'entire', 'time', 'Quenia', 'great', 'fluid', 'graceful', 'dancer', 'w/body', 'awareness', 'great', 'fun', 'friendly', 'patient', 'personality', 'great', 'cues', 'teaching', 'two', 'backup', 'dancers', 'also', 'have', 'fun', 'dancing', 'important.You', 'learn', '1', 'type', 'samba', 'step', 'many', 'other', 'traditional', 'Latin', 'dance', 'moves', 'are', 'fun', 'do.Intro', '2', 'minBasic', 'Dance', 'Step/Learn', 'beat', '3', 'minWarm-up', '12', 'min', 'great', 'stretching', 'lunges', 'ab', 'work', 'neck', 'stretching', 'rib', 'hip', 'stretching', 'circles', 'etc.Workout', '1/Teaching', 'Segment', '37', 'min', 'Quenia', 'w/2', 'backup', 'dancers', 'teaches', 'move', '1/4', 'time', 'even', 'turning', 'body', 'can', 'see', 'side', 'when', 'necessary', 'making', 'sure', 'move', 'out', 'body', 'even', 'are', '2', 'dancers', 'out', 'YOUR', 'left/right', 'done', 'instruction', '1/2', 'time', 'then', 'practice', 'few', 'times', 'then', 'slightly', 'slower', 'then', 'normal', 'latin', 'tempo', 'good', 'speed', 'beginners', 'new', 'learn', 'move', 'practice', 'then', 'move', 'before-hand', 'can', 'feel', 'link', 'then', 'top', 'build', 'routine', 'great', 'pace', 'keep', 'moving', 'so', ""'re"", 'never', 'bored.Workout', '2/Very', 'Jump/Hoping', '5', 'min', 'Here', 'do', 'routine', 'several', 'times', 'w/everyone', 'jumping', 'higher', 'adding', 'more', 'hops', 'moving', 'breakneck', 'speed', 'most', 'Latin', 'dances', 'cool', 'down', 'band/dancers', 'after.This', 'routine', 'good', 'amount', 'hopping', 'can', 'always', 'make', 'more', 'low-impact', 'still', 'do', 'easily', 'workout', '1', 'section', 'not', 'ballroom', 'style.Trailer', 'almost', 'dances', 'routine', 'learn', 'youtube', 'Samba', 'Reggae', 'Quenia', 'Ribeiro', 'also', 'website', 'worlddancenewyork', 'com']","The Samba Reggae Workout, with Quenia Ribeiro: Samba dance fitness classes, Samba dance instruction, Dance fitness cardio workout"
1084634,AWMU4C4CH21TE,B000RZP472,YogaGirl,"[98, 99]","I have to say right at the top that this is a great dance workout.  It is energetic; the music is hot and you will sweat.  You can see a clip of the dvd at the worlddancenewyork web site. What you can expect:Setting:  Quenia and 2 dancers with 5 drummers behind her.  She has to talk quite loudly because the drummers are right behind her and any one who has been in a live drumming samba class knows that the drums are pretty loud. The video quality is good.  The sound could have been louder.  I had to turn my tv up quite loud to get the pounding beat of samba reggae.Choreography:  There is a really nice warm-up before the workouts. In workout 1, she goes over each step many times and does add on and goes from the top.  The 1st workout goes over the entire routine once at the end; however by that time you have gone over the routine many many times from the top.  I was sweating and had to stop and drink some water.Workout 2 is just the choreography at a much faster pace with no instruction.  She does it 2x through.  The last section of the dvd is the bateria playing as it would do in a real class where the students dance in front of the bateria.  By that time I was so tired all I could do was wiggle from side to side.  My only complaint is that it would have been nice if the 2 background dancers had started free style dancing, like in a regular class.  There is no cool down.One caveat, don't skip the welcome section.  It starts with the bateria and then Quenia dances on stage doing part of the choreography and free style.  In my opinion, this litte section should have been at the end of dvd when the bateria is playing.  So if you have the energy, after the bateria section, you may want to play part of the welcome section again and dance with Quenia.Overall:  I loved, loved this dvd.  Will do it again!  It is a great aerobic workout.  Will probably add a cool down next time.  Get this dvd.  You will love it!",5,Wow! Wow!
