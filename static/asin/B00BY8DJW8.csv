1641013,A2OZBJ58CML9OS,B00BY8DJW8,A. Gammill,"[8, 8]","As a few others have already stated here, Willie Best was something of an unsung hero in the history of African American actors.  While some people these days may view his many similar roles--valet, manservant, butler, etc.--as subservient, the fact is he was often funnier than the stars of the films in which he appeared.  This is certainly the case with ""Whispering Ghosts,"" in which pretty much EVERY supposedly-funny line delivered by headliner Milton Berle falls flat.  The plot is standard b-movie mystery/comedy shenanigans, with able assistance from John Carradine and Brenda Joyce (who is a bit underused, but looks lovely).Be warned that the print used here hasn't undergone any specific restoration, and as such, it looks a bit soft compared to other films of the same vintage that have been cleaned up.  Nevertheless, A/V quality are perfectly acceptable, especially if you are a fan of the film and can overlook the less-than-pristine transfer.  I'd recommend this for  Willie Best fans, or hardcore Milton Berle fans.  It probably wouldn't be a bad warm-up to more enjoyable Halloween fare likeAbbott and Costello Meet Frankensteinor Willie Best co-starring with Bob Hope inThe Ghost Breakers.",3,Watch it for Willie,1381449600,"10 11, 2013",2013,1208,"['few', 'others', 'have', 'already', 'stated', 'here', 'Willie', 'Best', 'was', 'something', 'unsung', 'hero', 'history', 'African', 'American', 'actors', 'people', 'days', 'may', 'view', 'many', 'similar', 'roles', 'valet', 'manservant', 'butler', 'etc.', 'subservient', 'fact', 'was', 'often', 'funnier', 'stars', 'films', 'appeared', 'certainly', 'case', 'Whispering', 'Ghosts', 'pretty', 'much', 'EVERY', 'supposedly-funny', 'line', 'delivered', 'headliner', 'Milton', 'Berle', 'flat', 'plot', 'standard', 'b-movie', 'mystery/comedy', 'shenanigans', 'able', 'assistance', 'John', 'Carradine', 'Brenda', 'Joyce', 'who', 'bit', 'underused', 'lovely', '.Be', 'warned', 'print', 'used', 'here', ""n't"", 'undergone', 'specific', 'restoration', 'such', 'bit', 'soft', 'compared', 'other', 'films', 'same', 'vintage', 'have', 'been', 'cleaned', 'up', 'Nevertheless', 'A/V', 'quality', 'are', 'perfectly', 'acceptable', 'especially', 'are', 'fan', 'film', 'can', 'overlook', 'less-than-pristine', 'transfer', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'Willie', 'Best', 'fans', 'hardcore', 'Milton', 'Berle', 'fans', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'bad', 'warm-up', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'Halloween', 'fare', 'likeAbbott', 'Costello', 'Meet', 'Frankensteinor', 'Willie', 'Best', 'co-starring', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'Ghost', 'Breakers']",Whispering Ghosts

Jones,"[1, 1]",I have had an old beat up print of this movie for years and while Fox's print of it has not been restored it is still much better quality than what has been floating around the gray market. This is from the Fox archives which is made on demand burned not a pressed DVD. If you love these old mysteries and I do then you will enjoy watching this late at night with the lights out. Younger audiences probably won't find much here but if you are of a certain age and grew up watching old mystery movies on television you will enjoy this.,4,RARE MILTON BERLE MYSTERY,1379203200,"09 15, 2013",2013,534,"['have', 'had', 'old', 'beat', 'up', 'print', 'movie', 'years', 'Fox', 'print', 'not', 'been', 'restored', 'still', 'much', 'better', 'quality', 'what', 'been', 'floating', 'gray', 'market', 'Fox', 'archives', 'made', 'demand', 'burned', 'not', 'pressed', 'DVD', 'love', 'old', 'mysteries', 'do', 'then', 'will', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'late', 'night', 'lights', 'out', 'Younger', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'much', 'here', 'are', 'certain', 'age', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'old', 'mystery', 'movies', 'television', 'will', 'enjoy']",Whispering Ghosts

They apparently had to dig deeply in the vaults and only surfaced with a somewhat hot positive but this seldom seen comedy has never looked better. You can throw away your boot leg.
