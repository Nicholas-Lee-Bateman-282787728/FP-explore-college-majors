1012032,A3VM2LLBUEAVE,B000HC2M02,Bearfax,"[0, 0]",Ancient RelicIn Australia we have a public TV multi cultural TV network SBS. This accesses programs general ratings based channels would rarely show. This TV channel shows a range of non English movies either dubbed or subtexted.One day along comes this little gem from Germany which unfortunately was only shown twice. I managed to record 95% of the 3 hours plus program and was thoroughly intrigued. This is an Indiana Jones cum Time Travel program which retains your attention throughout trying to work our the paradox of a 21st century artefact found amongst 1st century discoveries. There are two forces maybe bad or good threatening our intrepid young searcher and his friends. Why are they trying to stop him and what do they know?Its a shame this movie was not released generally because its one of the best of its genre I've ever seen and I treasure the worn out video recording I've retained. Unfortunately the price available is far too excessive and I wish Amazon would get access to this film and release it at a reasonable price. Its well worth $40-$50 but not $110 plus. Come on Amazon. How about placing this one on your shelves.After completing this review I suddenly noted the program offered at a substantially reduced cost (less than $20). This makes it a very affordable item and I immediately bought it. And boy am I thankful....its as great as I remembered and well worth being in your library.Bearfax,5,A relic well worth discovering,1272153600,"04 25, 2010",2010,1424,"['Ancient', 'RelicIn', 'Australia', 'have', 'public', 'TV', 'multi', 'cultural', 'TV', 'network', 'SBS', 'programs', 'general', 'ratings', 'based', 'channels', 'would', 'rarely', 'show', 'TV', 'channel', 'range', 'non', 'English', 'movies', 'dubbed', 'subtexted.One', 'day', 'little', 'gem', 'Germany', 'unfortunately', 'was', 'only', 'shown', 'twice', 'managed', 'record', '95', '%', '3', 'hours', 'program', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'intrigued', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'cum', 'Time', 'Travel', 'program', 'attention', 'trying', 'work', 'paradox', '21st', 'century', 'artefact', 'found', 'amongst', '1st', 'century', 'discoveries', 'are', 'two', 'forces', 'maybe', 'bad', 'good', 'threatening', 'intrepid', 'young', 'searcher', 'friends', 'Why', 'are', 'trying', 'stop', 'what', 'do', 'know', 'shame', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'released', 'generally', 'one', 'best', 'genre', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'treasure', 'worn', 'out', 'recording', ""'ve"", 'retained', 'Unfortunately', 'price', 'available', 'far', 'too', 'excessive', 'wish', 'Amazon', 'would', 'get', 'access', 'film', 'release', 'reasonable', 'price', 'well', 'worth', '40-', '50', 'not', '110', 'Come', 'Amazon', 'How', 'placing', 'one', 'shelves.After', 'completing', 'review', 'suddenly', 'noted', 'program', 'offered', 'substantially', 'reduced', 'cost', 'less', '20', 'very', 'affordable', 'item', 'immediately', 'bought', 'boy', 'am', 'thankful', '.its', 'as', 'great', 'remembered', 'well', 'worth', 'being', 'library.Bearfax']",Ancient Relic
1012033,A304GUEPCPYM3Z,B000HC2M02,"citan-uzuki ""citan-uzuki""","[16, 16]","This is a long movie, but let me assure you that it is worth  your time.  Do not let the fact that it is dubbed from German discourage you.  It is one of the better dubs out there.The main selling point of this movie is the plot.  It is both original and refreshing.  It's not science fiction, although the description might give you that impression.  This is one of those movies that is not easy to categorize.  Even so, there's action, drama, romance, suspense, and comedy.  The basic plot revolves around the finding of an unusual booklet from a 2000 year old burial tomb.  The booklet appears to be the instruction manual for a video recorder.  Given the location and the time period in question, the archeologists concluded that it is possible that this might lead them to a digital video recording of the events that were taking place during the time that the tomb was made.  The location and time being Jerusalem, during the time of Christ.  I won't spoil the plot for you though.This is not one of those movies that you should watch if you have limited time.  It takes three hours from the start to the conclusion.  But it will definitely be worth it.  I've read reviews of this movie.  They were mostly 3-star reviews, but I took a chance and rented it anyway.  I'm glad that I did. In my view, this is a 4.5 star movie.",5,"Long, but definitely worth it",1165104000,"12 3, 2006",2006,1329,"['long', 'movie', 'let', 'assure', 'time', 'Do', 'not', 'let', 'fact', 'dubbed', 'German', 'discourage', 'one', 'better', 'dubs', 'there.The', 'main', 'selling', 'point', 'movie', 'plot', 'original', 'refreshing', 'not', 'science', 'fiction', 'description', 'might', 'give', 'impression', 'one', 'movies', 'not', 'easy', 'categorize', 'Even', 'so', 'action', 'drama', 'romance', 'suspense', 'comedy', 'basic', 'plot', 'revolves', 'finding', 'unusual', 'booklet', '2000', 'year', 'old', 'burial', 'tomb', 'booklet', 'be', 'instruction', 'manual', 'video', 'recorder', 'Given', 'location', 'time', 'period', 'question', 'archeologists', 'concluded', 'possible', 'might', 'lead', 'digital', 'video', 'recording', 'events', 'were', 'taking', 'place', 'time', 'tomb', 'was', 'made', 'location', 'time', 'being', 'Jerusalem', 'time', 'Christ', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'plot', 'though.This', 'not', 'one', 'movies', 'should', 'watch', 'have', 'limited', 'time', 'three', 'hours', 'start', 'conclusion', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', ""'ve"", 'read', 'reviews', 'movie', 'were', 'mostly', '3-star', 'reviews', 'took', 'chance', 'rented', 'anyway', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'view', '4.5', 'star', 'movie']",Ancient Relic

1012035,A38IZWL17TEX13,B000HC2M02,Scott Duncan,"[1, 2]","A potentially decent film which is just dragged out with endless episodes of the ""hero"" getting chased, kidnappe, shot at, tortured (mildly), etc.  Then about 20 minutes before the end it becomes rather clear what's going to be the answer for one of the questions in the film.  Other questions either are not that interesting to find the answers to or are not really answered, though implied.  The latter wouldn't be bad except that the answers don't seem to lead to anything relevant as the movie ends focusing on the earlier ""exposed"" answer.  Yeah...I don't want toruin it for anyone by giving the ending points away, but at least 90 minutes of this long film are, as I note, a repetitive series of chasing around with no real advancement of the plot.  So I give it a three for the other 90 minutes which is okay, though I would not watch it again.",3,It is too long,1309132800,"06 27, 2011",2011,851,"['potentially', 'decent', 'film', 'just', 'dragged', 'out', 'endless', 'episodes', 'hero', 'getting', 'chased', 'kidnappe', 'shot', 'tortured', 'mildly', 'etc', 'Then', '20', 'minutes', 'end', 'rather', 'clear', 'what', 'going', 'be', 'answer', 'one', 'questions', 'film', 'Other', 'questions', 'are', 'not', 'interesting', 'find', 'answers', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'answered', 'though', 'implied', 'latter', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'bad', 'answers', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'lead', 'anything', 'relevant', 'movie', 'focusing', 'earlier', 'exposed', 'answer', 'Yeah', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'toruin', 'anyone', 'giving', 'ending', 'points', 'away', 'least', '90', 'minutes', 'long', 'film', 'are', 'note', 'repetitive', 'series', 'chasing', 'real', 'advancement', 'plot', 'give', 'three', 'other', '90', 'minutes', 'okay', 'would', 'not', 'watch', 'again']",Ancient Relic
