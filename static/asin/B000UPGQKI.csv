I don't care about the three minutes of material personally, perhaps he had to put it in there to get it on HBO, but now all I can do is tell Social Studies teachers about it instead of telling my students to watch it, and I'm a music teacher!  If Mr. Wuhl were really the kind, compassionate, intelligent person he makes himself out to be, he would make a Middle School version of this and release it for educational purposes.  Yeah, I know that Middle School kids already use all these words and have seen everything that they show in this excellent presentation, but we aren't allowed to!  It wouldn't be ummm Professional, yeah - that's it.  If you loved Kenneth C. Davis's &#34;Don't Know Much About History,&#34; this will literally make you snort milk through your nose.
