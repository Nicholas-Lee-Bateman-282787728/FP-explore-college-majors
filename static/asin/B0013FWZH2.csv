It seems like the parts that pop up with her in it interrupt the story of Oliver and Simon instead of movie it along.  If the makers of the film would have just done away with the researcher angle it would have been better.  Although I was relieved toward the end when she took a shower.  The smeared eyeliner she was sporting for the last portion of her research was annoying.  Also, her character didn't show any signs of being obsessed with the research aside from a phone call she received from a friend telling her she needs to give it a break.  And why oh why did she break down and cry?  If you are unnerved by what you see then she shouldn't have been looking for it nor should have she chosen Oliver's story for ther thesis.  Plus not really alot of mention about why she chose the topic or what class she is doing it for.I have seen Cannibal which is based on the story but my complaint was there was no sound and the first half had too much sex and not enough story...this one just needed to do away with the girl.  It was nice to see more of Simon's relationship before he met Oliver.  Although, since I was already familiar with the film the story was a bit boring and aside from the relationship of Simon and Felix nothing new was added.  This version lacked alot of the gore contained in the Cannibal movie and oddly enough wasn't as gory as I thought it would be.",2,Female researcher is not needed....,1335916800,"05 2, 2012",2012,1462,"['movie', 'pointless', 'female', 'research', 'character', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'parts', 'pop', 'up', 'story', 'Oliver', 'Simon', 'instead', 'movie', 'along', 'makers', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'just', 'done', 'away', 'researcher', 'angle', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'was', 'relieved', 'end', 'when', 'took', 'shower', 'smeared', 'eyeliner', 'was', 'sporting', 'last', 'portion', 'research', 'was', 'annoying', 'Also', 'character', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'signs', 'being', 'obsessed', 'research', 'aside', 'phone', 'call', 'received', 'friend', 'telling', 'give', 'break', 'why', 'oh', 'why', 'did', 'break', 'down', 'cry', 'are', 'unnerved', 'what', 'see', 'then', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'looking', 'should', 'have', 'chosen', 'Oliver', 'story', 'ther', 'thesis', 'not', 'really', 'alot', 'mention', 'why', 'chose', 'topic', 'what', 'class', 'doing', 'for.I', 'have', 'seen', 'Cannibal', 'based', 'story', 'complaint', 'was', 'was', 'sound', 'first', 'half', 'had', 'too', 'much', 'sex', 'not', 'enough', 'story', 'one', 'just', 'needed', 'do', 'away', 'girl', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'more', 'Simon', 'relationship', 'met', 'Oliver', 'was', 'already', 'familiar', 'film', 'story', 'was', 'bit', 'boring', 'aside', 'relationship', 'Simon', 'Felix', 'nothing', 'new', 'was', 'added', 'version', 'lacked', 'alot', 'gore', 'contained', 'Cannibal', 'movie', 'oddly', 'enough', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'gory', 'thought', 'would', 'be']",Grimm Love [Region 4]
1142040,A6DOCZ10B7JAJ,B0013FWZH2,"C. Christopher Blackshere ""Mackshere""","[6, 7]","Grimm Love is inspired by the gruesome true story of Armin Meiwes, a depraved soul who placed an ad on the internet in search of a person willing to sacrifice their flesh in order to appease his cannibalistic urges.  He received one willing victim, and the disturbing results were caught on film.  This stunning tale was told in relentless fashion in the movie Cannibal, which was immediately banned in Germany.This Fangoria Frightfest entry attempts to dial back some of the repulsive details.  Even without the graphic nudity or high level of sexual content, this grueling story might still be too much for many to handle.  It observes this bizarre murder case from the outside, through the eyes of Katie(Keri Russell).  She's an American woman studying criminal psychology.  Katie has been inexplicably drawn to the case, with a certain morbid fascination that pulls her further and further into this dark world.The story progresses with several flashbacks to both men's childhoods.  This is done in an attempt to delve into the psychological factors leading up to their demented relationship.  This backstory is well-developed, but not necessarily convincing.  It seems that we the viewers are supposed to share Katie's insurmountable fear and guilt as her obsession magnifies.  Even though the acting by Russell was astounding, I felt her inclusion into the story didn't really add much to the overall shock factor.  In fact it might have hampered it a little bit.That's not to say this is a film for the timid viewer.  It depicts cannibalism and murder along with some strong sexual situations.  I'm sure this movie would have packed a more devastating punch if I hadn't already seen the sick movie Cannibal.  Grimm Love did feel like a watered down version of the same story.  But still, it is very well done and is bound to soil the shorts of many less jaded horror fans.

These people were some of the sickest I have ever seen.  How can you be so crazy that you want another person to  murder you and eat your flesh?  How can you be so crazy that you want to eat other peoples flesh?I thought this was the most disgusting  thing I had ever heard of.  Two gay men eating each other's flesh made me sick.  I could not believe that one tried to bite off the private part of the other one and then when he couldn't he took a knife and cut it off while the sicko was screaming.  It was almost funny when he told him he couldn't bite all the way through it.  Then, while the man was bleeding,he cooked his penis on the stove and gave him some of his own flesh.  The man whose meat was cooked told him he didn't think it would be that touch!(I laughed so hard!)  Then the other nut ate it.  He then cut the man up and ate him.I wish they had taken all those sick perverts and skinned them alive and fed them to the wild animals in the woods.  I wonder if they would like that?

1142042,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B0013FWZH2,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[2, 2]","GRIM LOVE""Grim Love"" is based on the Armin Meiwes in which said man killed and ate a willing victim; you should really look it up because it is crazy. The willing victim was a man named Bernd J&uuml;rgen Brandes and while this film changed the names there is a lot here that really happened. Particularly when the two get together.Katie (Keri Russell) is a student who is fascinated by the case and decides to do a study on it. As she makes her way to the scene of the crime she digs deeper into the minds of these two. We see this in flashbacks and it starts to affect her. One man obsessed with cutting and butchering who was overly mothered. And another who lost his mother and feels it is his fault. In feeling that way he feels he must be punished and does not deserve a happy life. Will she write an award winning paper or will she go insane getting to know these men.Writer T.S. Faull did a really good job here in changing enough for legal reasons but still keeping all of the important facts intact. I am sure it was tough to do since some things had to be changed. Director Martin Weiz did a good job here keeping things kinda bleak and at times disturbing. Still the big draw here is the lead performances from Thomas Kretschmann as the cannibal and Thomas Huber as the willing participant. They really did fantastic jobs here and played the parts in a very realistic way. Thomas K's portrayal of the killer is excellent showcasing how and why this man became the man he became. Thomas H on the other hand has to play a man who feels he must be punished and the only way to be properly punished is by being eaten, he as well is excellent.I have to say that this was much better than I thought it would be. I did know about the case before this film was even in production. I say that because I think because of that I judged it before hand like it could not live up to what really happened. I have to say that half of the film not only lived up to but surpassed it. That of course is the half of the film that dealt with the two men who came together like nobody would believe. Those of course are the flashbacks and they were the best part of this film. Now not to say that the rest of the film set in the present with Keri Russell as the student investigating this is bad. In fact it is good but the flashback half of the film surpasses it in my opinion. In doing so it really makes me wish that the entire film should have been spent with the two destined to be.In still this was a good movie that when it came time for creepy it very much accomplished its goal. The acting her was excellent and so was the audio commentary on the DVD. Some might be a bit to disturbed by some of things that happen on screen. But for those interested in true crime films I say give this a chance. This by the way is another in the Fangoria Fright Fest collection.  I highly recommend you check out the actual case. The killer had other offers previous but the men chickened out, he never made any one do anything against their will. When he finally met this guy that was proven to be true because he video taped everything. Check out all the info on the actual case, it is crazy.",4,FANGORIA FRIGHT FEST TACKELS A TRUE STORY,1351555200,"10 30, 2012",2012,3177,"['GRIM', 'LOVE', 'Grim', 'Love', 'based', 'Armin', 'Meiwes', 'said', 'man', 'killed', 'ate', 'willing', 'victim', 'should', 'really', 'look', 'up', 'crazy', 'willing', 'victim', 'was', 'man', 'named', 'Bernd', 'J', 'uuml', 'rgen', 'Brandes', 'film', 'changed', 'names', 'lot', 'here', 'really', 'happened', 'Particularly', 'when', 'two', 'get', 'together.Katie', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'student', 'who', 'fascinated', 'case', 'decides', 'do', 'study', 'way', 'scene', 'crime', 'deeper', 'minds', 'two', 'see', 'flashbacks', 'affect', 'One', 'man', 'obsessed', 'cutting', 'butchering', 'who', 'was', 'overly', 'mothered', 'who', 'lost', 'mother', 'feels', 'fault', 'feeling', 'way', 'must', 'be', 'punished', 'not', 'deserve', 'happy', 'life', 'Will', 'write', 'award', 'winning', 'paper', 'will', 'go', 'insane', 'getting', 'know', 'men.Writer', 'T.S', 'Faull', 'did', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'here', 'changing', 'enough', 'legal', 'reasons', 'still', 'keeping', 'important', 'facts', 'intact', 'am', 'sure', 'was', 'tough', 'do', 'things', 'had', 'be', 'changed', 'Director', 'Martin', 'Weiz', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'here', 'keeping', 'things', 'kinda', 'bleak', 'times', 'disturbing', 'Still', 'big', 'draw', 'here', 'lead', 'performances', 'Thomas', 'Kretschmann', 'cannibal', 'Thomas', 'Huber', 'willing', 'participant', 'really', 'did', 'fantastic', 'jobs', 'here', 'played', 'parts', 'very', 'realistic', 'way', 'Thomas', 'K', 'portrayal', 'killer', 'excellent', 'showcasing', 'how', 'why', 'man', 'became', 'man', 'became', 'Thomas', 'H', 'other', 'hand', 'play', 'man', 'who', 'must', 'be', 'punished', 'only', 'way', 'be', 'properly', 'punished', 'being', 'eaten', 'as', 'well', 'excellent.I', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'did', 'know', 'case', 'film', 'was', 'even', 'production', 'say', 'think', 'judged', 'hand', 'could', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'have', 'say', 'half', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'lived', 'up', 'surpassed', 'course', 'half', 'film', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'came', 'together', 'nobody', 'would', 'believe', 'course', 'are', 'flashbacks', 'were', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'Now', 'not', 'say', 'rest', 'film', 'set', 'present', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'student', 'investigating', 'bad', 'fact', 'good', 'flashback', 'half', 'film', 'opinion', 'doing', 'really', 'wish', 'entire', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'spent', 'two', 'destined', 'be.In', 'still', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'when', 'came', 'time', 'creepy', 'very', 'much', 'accomplished', 'goal', 'acting', 'was', 'excellent', 'so', 'was', 'audio', 'commentary', 'DVD', 'might', 'be', 'bit', 'disturbed', 'things', 'happen', 'screen', 'interested', 'true', 'crime', 'films', 'say', 'give', 'chance', 'way', 'Fangoria', 'Fright', 'Fest', 'collection', 'highly', 'recommend', 'check', 'out', 'actual', 'case', 'killer', 'had', 'other', 'offers', 'previous', 'men', 'chickened', 'out', 'never', 'made', 'one', 'do', 'anything', 'will', 'When', 'finally', 'met', 'guy', 'was', 'proven', 'be', 'true', 'taped', 'everything', 'Check', 'info', 'actual', 'case', 'crazy']",Grimm Love [Region 4]
1142043,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0013FWZH2,Grady Harp,"[12, 13]","Director Martin Weisz and writer T.S. Faull created this movie adaptation ROHTENBURG (GRIMM LOVE) of a famous crime that is so bizarre it deserves a summary from the legal aspects in order to appreciate the quality of the film. Names have all been changed, including the spelling of the title - 'Rotenburg', or 'red castle', is the name of the small village where this grisly event took place.  The facts of the case are as follows: 'Armin Meiwes (born 1 December 1961) is a German man who achieved international notoriety for killing and eating a voluntary victim whom he had found via the internet. After Meiwes and the victim jointly attempted to eat the victim's severed penis, Meiwes killed his victim and proceeded to eat a large amount of his flesh. Because of his deeds, Meiwes is also known as the Rotenburg Cannibal or Der Metzgermeister (The Master Butcher). Looking for a willing victim, Meiwes posted an advertisement at a website, The Cannibal Cafe, whose disclaimer mentions the distinction between reality and fantasy. Meiwes's post stated that he was ""looking for a well-built 21 to 40-year-old to be slaughtered and then consumed"". Bernd J&uuml;rgen Brandes  answered the advertisement. Many other people responded to the advertisement, but backed out; Meiwes did not attempt to force them to do anything against their will. As is known from a videotape the two made when they met on March 9, 2001 in Meiwes's home in the small village of Rotenburg, Meiwes amputated Brandes's penis and the two men attempted to eat the penis together before Brandes was killed. Brandes had insisted that Meiwes attempt to bite his penis off. This did not work, though Meiwes was able to burst both of Brandes's testicles by biting them. Ultimately, Meiwes used a knife to remove Brandes's penis. Brandes apparently tried to eat some of his own penis raw, but could not because it was too tough and, as he put it, ""chewy"". Meiwes then saut&eacute;ed the penis in a pan with salt, pepper, wine and garlic, he then fried it with some of Brande's fat but by then it was too burned to be consumed. He then chopped it up into chunks and fed it to his dog. According to journalists who saw the video (which has not been made public), Brandes may already have been too weakened from blood loss to actually eat any of his penis. Meiwes read a Star Trek book for three hours, while Brandes lay bleeding in the bath. Meiwes apparently gave him large quantities of alcohol and painkillers, 20 sleeping pills and a bottle of schnapps, and finally killed him in a room that he had built in his house for this purpose, the Slaughter Room. After stabbing Brandes to death in the throat, he hung the body on a meathook and tore chunks of flesh from it; he even tried to grind the bones to use as flour. The whole scene was recorded on the two-hour videotape. Meiwes ate the body over the next 10 months, storing body parts in his freezer under pizza boxes and consuming up to 20 kg of the flesh.'  These are the facts of this case.In order to make this film 'palatable' the writer and director introduce a new character - Katie (Keri Russell) is an American Psychology student who travels to Germany to explore the depths of the dark interstices of human behavior. It is though her eyes and imagined flashbacks visiting the places of the childhood and adulthood the two people involved that she offers the audience the understanding of this act.  Oliver Hartwin (Thomas Kretschmann) is first seen as a child (Rainier Meissner) and the seeds of his strange behavior are briefly identified.  We also meet Simon (Thomas Huber), learn of his background and his relationship to his mother (Helga Bellinghausen), and meet him with his lover Felix (Marcus Lucas) in what appears to be a healthy relationship.  But Simon surfs the internet, finds Oliver's curious invitation to cannibalism, and decides to become involved in a fantasy he has always had.  The two men meet and mutually agree to take part in the act of Oliver's slow cannibalistic murder of Simon.  Many of the aspects of the real case are included, but the writer and director  know when to hold back and also know when to leave the story alone, without the trial or follow-up, that leaves the audience shocked but also somehow makes the entire story seem more like a nightmare than an actual deed.Kretschmann and Huber both are extremely fine actors and have found that thin thread of inner fear and self-doubt that makes us able to understand the bizarre act we are watching.  Keri Russell is very good in the tiny part she plays (the deleted scenes on the DVD show her role was originally larger), adding a bit of a reality touch for the audience, helping us through this story.  There are technical problems with the film: cinematographer Jonathan Sela uses scratchy developing for the flashback scenes which are not always suitably inserted, and the musical score by Steven Gutheinz is often too dependent of the pipe organ fright tactics of horror pictures. It is a difficult subject to watch but in all the film presents a bit of reportage in a watchable manner.  Truth is stranger than fiction.

This film is inspired by a true story of a cannibal from Germany and his WILLING victim he met on a cannibal chat room via Internet. If that disturbs you then probably not best choice for you. If you are intrigued, you are in for quite a ride. The film follows the real case very closely, but of course changes were made for the film. Not a blood and gore movie, this is an emotional ride through the lives and minds of the killer and victim. The cannibalism depiction is tastefully done, and is actually creates a moving (although taboo and disturbing) bond between the two men.

1142046,AHQ13I9CI4US6,B0013FWZH2,"Kathryn E. Etier ""Miss Bob""","[20, 20]","""What you are about to see is inspired by a true story that happened in Germany not too long ago...""The Armin Meiwes cannibal murder case is the basis of Grimm Love, a German import that had been banned in Germany in 2006 before it could be released, because it ""infringed upon the personal [or personality] rights of Armin Meiwes."" Subsequently, the film was sold for international release and the ban was annulled in 2009 (in favor of ""freedom of arts"").American actress Keri Russell plays the part of Katie Armstrong, an American graduate student studying criminal psychology in Germany, fascinated with the case of a cannibal who lured his willing victim using the Internet. They met in a ""cannibalism chat room."" As the story develops, she narrates, spinning a tale of her building obsession with the subjects of her research.Flashbacks inform the viewer of the tortured childhood of Oliver Hartwin (Thomas Kretschmann), a lederhosen-wearing schoolboy, following him and a friend spying on a neighbor woman butchering a pig and watching slasher films at the cinema, as well as his being overly mothered at home. Katie visits the school he attended as a child and is expelled from the building for digging into its dark memories. Flashbacks of Simon Grombeck's (Thomas Huber) life expose his boyhood guilt, and his adult love affair and fascination with butchered bodies.Katie visits the home Oliver lived in as an adult -- dominated by his shrewish, scraggly-haired mother to whom he was doggedly devoted -- going so far as to break a window to gain access. As she goes from room to room taking photographs, flashbacks delineate events that had occurred within, all of them ominous.Grimm Love is an effectively creepy film. The subject matter is darkly illustrated by moody cinematography, downbeat portrayals, and an overall gloominess. Parallel tellings of the graduate student's growing obsession and Hartwin's descent into a madness few would want to witness are seamlessly edited. As she becomes more involved in her research, she begins to identify with him.Not for the squeamish, Grimm Love will have viewers wondering every time someone is seen with a fork, but not wanting to discover the menu. No matter how sympathetically the characters are portrayed at times, the audience will be making value judgments. Some of the most revolting scenes are bloodless as Oliver reads from the chat room instructions on how to set up for the slaughter of a human, and prepares a potential victim for butchering. When Oliver and Simon exchange e-mails, queasiness is inevitable.While much of Grimm Love is dramatization and fiction, much of the relationship and actions between Hartwin and Grombeck are true to the Meiwes case. It is dark, intense, and disturbing, so devoid of comic relief (or any other relief) that it nearly serves as documentary. Viewers know how the relationship between the two men will turn out, and speculate where the graduate student's fixation on the macabre case will take her. The horror depicted may cause viewers to stop the movie before they find out.Grimm Love is sinister, depressing, repugnant, and abhorrent. It is also well made, though I think I would have been happier if I hadn't seen it.",3,"When checking online for a place to eat tonight, take my advice, avoid the Cannibal Cantina.",1279584000,"07 20, 2010",2010,3230,"['What', 'are', 'see', 'inspired', 'true', 'story', 'happened', 'Germany', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'ago', 'Armin', 'Meiwes', 'cannibal', 'murder', 'case', 'basis', 'Grimm', 'Love', 'German', 'import', 'had', 'been', 'banned', 'Germany', '2006', 'could', 'be', 'released', 'infringed', 'personal', '[', 'personality', ']', 'rights', 'Armin', 'Meiwes', 'Subsequently', 'film', 'was', 'sold', 'international', 'release', 'ban', 'was', 'annulled', '2009', 'favor', 'freedom', 'arts', '.American', 'actress', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'part', 'Katie', 'Armstrong', 'American', 'graduate', 'student', 'studying', 'criminal', 'psychology', 'Germany', 'fascinated', 'case', 'cannibal', 'who', 'lured', 'willing', 'victim', 'using', 'Internet', 'met', 'cannibalism', 'room', 'story', 'spinning', 'tale', 'building', 'obsession', 'subjects', 'research.Flashbacks', 'inform', 'viewer', 'tortured', 'childhood', 'Oliver', 'Hartwin', 'Thomas', 'Kretschmann', 'lederhosen-wearing', 'schoolboy', 'following', 'friend', 'spying', 'neighbor', 'woman', 'butchering', 'pig', 'watching', 'slasher', 'films', 'cinema', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'overly', 'mothered', 'home', 'Katie', 'school', 'attended', 'child', 'expelled', 'building', 'digging', 'dark', 'memories', 'Flashbacks', 'Simon', 'Grombeck', 'Thomas', 'Huber', 'life', 'expose', 'boyhood', 'guilt', 'adult', 'love', 'affair', 'fascination', 'butchered', 'bodies.Katie', 'home', 'Oliver', 'lived', 'adult', 'dominated', 'shrewish', 'scraggly-haired', 'mother', 'whom', 'was', 'doggedly', 'devoted', 'going', 'so', 'far', 'break', 'window', 'gain', 'access', 'room', 'room', 'taking', 'photographs', 'flashbacks', 'delineate', 'events', 'had', 'occurred', 'ominous.Grimm', 'Love', 'effectively', 'creepy', 'film', 'subject', 'matter', 'darkly', 'illustrated', 'moody', 'cinematography', 'downbeat', 'portrayals', 'overall', 'gloominess', 'Parallel', 'tellings', 'graduate', 'student', 'growing', 'obsession', 'Hartwin', 'descent', 'madness', 'few', 'would', 'want', 'witness', 'are', 'seamlessly', 'edited', 'more', 'involved', 'research', 'identify', 'him.Not', 'squeamish', 'Grimm', 'Love', 'will', 'have', 'viewers', 'wondering', 'time', 'someone', 'seen', 'fork', 'not', 'wanting', 'discover', 'menu', 'matter', 'how', 'sympathetically', 'characters', 'are', 'portrayed', 'times', 'audience', 'will', 'be', 'making', 'value', 'judgments', 'most', 'revolting', 'scenes', 'are', 'bloodless', 'Oliver', 'chat', 'room', 'instructions', 'how', 'set', 'up', 'slaughter', 'human', 'potential', 'victim', 'butchering', 'When', 'Oliver', 'Simon', 'exchange', 'e-mails', 'queasiness', 'inevitable.While', 'much', 'Grimm', 'Love', 'dramatization', 'fiction', 'much', 'relationship', 'actions', 'Hartwin', 'Grombeck', 'are', 'true', 'Meiwes', 'case', 'dark', 'intense', 'disturbing', 'devoid', 'comic', 'relief', 'other', 'relief', 'nearly', 'documentary', 'Viewers', 'know', 'how', 'relationship', 'two', 'men', 'will', 'turn', 'out', 'speculate', 'where', 'graduate', 'student', 'fixation', 'macabre', 'case', 'will', 'take', 'horror', 'depicted', 'may', 'cause', 'viewers', 'stop', 'movie', 'find', 'out.Grimm', 'Love', 'sinister', 'depressing', 'repugnant', 'abhorrent', 'also', 'well', 'made', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'happier', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen']",Grimm Love [Region 4]

AND HOPEFULLY YOU WILL BE CONVINCED NOT TO SEE IT BECAUSE IT MAY LIKELY SCAR YOU FOR LIFE.....Grimm Love tells the true and very sick story that happened in Germany some years ago where two genuinly sick and disturbed men meet in a cannibal chatroom. One is looking for a lover that is willing to be eatin alive. The other with an exact opposite mental condition desires that his lover would eat him alive starting with biting off his penis.Both men struggle with their ensatiable desires as best they can and dream of the day when they can find anyone willing to fullfill their macabre dream. Obviously they eventually meet and begin to get to know each other. Both can barely stand it until the deed is done. Once the moment comes the man that wishes to be devoured must become as intoxicated as possible so that he does not experience the pain in the most tormenting manner. In the end they go through with it and one man bites off the other's penis, cooks it in an pan, then devours it. He also slowly watchhes the other die as he eats more and more of his lovers body.In the mean time a college student wants to write her thesis on the true story, and begins an indepth investigation that takes her half way around the world to discover what really happened and try to understand why these men could have become so demented. For a time the student is overwhelmed by the tale and even begins to understand what might have driven them.

The scenes of butchering, penis eating and so fourth are done in extreme detail and are so realistic looking that even medical professionals think it looks so real they wonder if perhaps a real cadaver was used for these scenes.

The story is told through a female student Katie Armstrong (Keri Russell) who is writing her thesis and decides to do it on this particular case of cannibalism, by trying to unpick the mental state of both men. She is used as narrator to lay out the scene and in an irritating way try to find out what made both men want to do this.We discover that both of the men have got mother issues, one who abandoned her son and the other who was over controlling, they are both homosexual and they are both men, so masses to unpick there. That for me was the worst part of this film the analysis. If they had have just played out what had happened and explained the past in flash back without the cod psychology I would have been a lot happier.The story itself is strong enough to have carried on its own. It is extremely well acted especially Thomas Kretchmann who plays Oliver. Thomas Huber as Simon (the dinner guest) was also brilliant. Simon felt he could never really be loved until he had been consumed and Oliver felt that until he had consumed someone he could never really love them, so a match made in heaven then. There was a tribe of Indians in South America who used to eat their loved ones when they died to stop them being buried in the cold earth, but I think they all got Mad Cow disease so not a good analogy with this probably. Any how they made me understand what the motivation was and it is done with care and even compassion.The horror itself is all off screen this is not one for gore fans and in many ways it could have been a lot better, the `bite it off' scene was still fairly powerful, but less of the sympathetic student and more of the actual story would have been muchly welcomed. This was made using German actors for the most part and as some have commented if the Germans had made it themselves it would probably have been a lot better, still not a bad effort but not quite the 4 stars but a ruddy good try, I will end there as I'm off for a quick finger buffet.",3,Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?,1335052800,"04 22, 2012",2012,2173,"['based', 'true', 'life', 'cannibalism', 'case', 'Oliver', 'Hartwin', 'who', 'went', 'line', 'find', 'someone', 'could', 'love', 'gobble', 'up', 'not', 'other', 'sort', 'then', 'did', 'exactly', 'story', 'told', 'female', 'student', 'Katie', 'Armstrong', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'who', 'writing', 'thesis', 'decides', 'do', 'particular', 'case', 'cannibalism', 'trying', 'unpick', 'mental', 'state', 'men', 'used', 'narrator', 'lay', 'out', 'scene', 'irritating', 'way', 'try', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'made', 'men', 'want', 'do', 'this.We', 'discover', 'men', 'have', 'got', 'mother', 'issues', 'one', 'who', 'abandoned', 'son', 'other', 'who', 'was', 'controlling', 'are', 'homosexual', 'are', 'men', 'so', 'unpick', 'there', 'was', 'worst', 'part', 'film', 'analysis', 'had', 'have', 'just', 'played', 'out', 'what', 'had', 'happened', 'explained', 'past', 'flash', 'back', 'cod', 'psychology', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'happier.The', 'story', 'strong', 'enough', 'have', 'carried', 'own', 'extremely', 'well', 'acted', 'especially', 'Thomas', 'Kretchmann', 'who', 'Oliver', 'Thomas', 'Huber', 'Simon', 'dinner', 'guest', 'was', 'also', 'brilliant', 'Simon', 'felt', 'could', 'never', 'really', 'be', 'loved', 'had', 'been', 'consumed', 'Oliver', 'felt', 'had', 'consumed', 'someone', 'could', 'never', 'really', 'love', 'so', 'match', 'made', 'heaven', 'then', 'was', 'tribe', 'Indians', 'South', 'America', 'who', 'used', 'eat', 'loved', 'ones', 'when', 'died', 'stop', 'being', 'buried', 'cold', 'earth', 'think', 'got', 'Mad', 'Cow', 'disease', 'so', 'not', 'good', 'analogy', 'probably', 'Any', 'how', 'made', 'understand', 'what', 'motivation', 'was', 'done', 'care', 'even', 'compassion.The', 'horror', 'off', 'screen', 'not', 'one', 'gore', 'fans', 'many', 'ways', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'bite', 'off', 'scene', 'was', 'still', 'fairly', 'powerful', 'less', 'sympathetic', 'student', 'more', 'actual', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'muchly', 'welcomed', 'was', 'made', 'using', 'German', 'actors', 'most', 'part', 'have', 'commented', 'Germans', 'had', 'made', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'still', 'not', 'bad', 'effort', 'not', 'quite', '4', 'stars', 'ruddy', 'good', 'try', 'will', 'end', 'there', ""'m"", 'off', 'quick', 'finger', 'buffet']",Grimm Love [Region 4]
