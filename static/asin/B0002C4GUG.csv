829881,A3K8POFWCQI2GS,B0002C4GUG,Char,"[1, 1]","The story, which takes place between a pioneer couple who live in a cabin on the prairie, is narrated by the voice of an older woman as she looks back on a season during early marriage when her heart was very hard.  She was embittered because of the sudden death of two precious young daughters.  A pastor-neighbor foists an orphan boy on her and her husband but she cannot love this boy.  She doesn't want him and she resents him for everything he does.The movie is very much the story of the boy, as much as it is the story of an important test in the lives of the husband and wife.  I felt that the actor who played the character of this young man was exceptional, if for no other reason than that I found him very likable and lovable--which is, of course, what the movie makers wanted the viewer to feel.A great family movie for any season of the heart or of the year.  Because of the ending scene which is a turning point of realization when a Love in Christ is born, it would be an especially appropriate film for the Christmas season.I LOVED the movie, felt that the woman's narrative voice was especially well done, and I am still especially touched with love whenever I recall this young orphan boy of the story.  I don't know if it was the actor's skill or just the person himself, but the boy had such a sweet heart.This is an especially good family film.  I think there is no reason that anyone should not see it!  Highly recommend it.",5,Exceptionally touching story in which a song opens a hard heart to love a child,1366848000,"04 25, 2013",2013,1447,"['story', 'place', 'pioneer', 'couple', 'who', 'live', 'cabin', 'prairie', 'narrated', 'voice', 'older', 'woman', 'back', 'season', 'early', 'marriage', 'when', 'heart', 'was', 'very', 'hard', 'was', 'embittered', 'sudden', 'death', 'two', 'precious', 'young', 'daughters', 'pastor-neighbor', 'foists', 'orphan', 'boy', 'husband', 'can', 'not', 'love', 'boy', ""n't"", 'want', 'everything', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'story', 'boy', 'as', 'much', 'story', 'important', 'test', 'lives', 'husband', 'wife', 'felt', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'character', 'young', 'man', 'was', 'exceptional', 'other', 'reason', 'found', 'very', 'likable', 'lovable', 'course', 'what', 'movie', 'makers', 'wanted', 'viewer', 'feel.A', 'great', 'family', 'movie', 'season', 'heart', 'year', 'ending', 'scene', 'turning', 'point', 'realization', 'when', 'Love', 'Christ', 'born', 'would', 'be', 'especially', 'appropriate', 'film', 'Christmas', 'season.I', 'LOVED', 'movie', 'felt', 'woman', 'narrative', 'voice', 'was', 'especially', 'well', 'done', 'am', 'still', 'especially', 'touched', 'love', 'whenever', 'recall', 'young', 'orphan', 'boy', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'actor', 'skill', 'just', 'person', 'boy', 'had', 'sweet', 'heart.This', 'especially', 'good', 'family', 'film', 'think', 'reason', 'anyone', 'should', 'not', 'see', 'Highly', 'recommend']",Seasons of the Heart
