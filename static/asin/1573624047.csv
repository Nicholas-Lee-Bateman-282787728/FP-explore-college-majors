189759,A4MQ75RMLWTS4,1573624047,A. Bouardi,"[3, 5]","I first watched this movie 3 years ago.  It drives me as nutsy today as it did 3 years ago.  Besides the amusing plot of pairing up a snotty, overly indulged jerk like Buddy Ackerman (K Spacey) and the assitant Guy (a crappy actor named Frank Whaley)...this movie has some of the most slicing, smack-down dialogue I've ever seen.  You know, the kinds of things you'd want to say if you had an assistant, no conscience, and a guarantee that they would never come to your home, tie you up, paper-cut you, or put tabasco in your wounds.  Heh.  Lines like &quot;You look happy -- I hate that!&quot; and &quot;What Equal contains is not my concern...when I ask for Sweet 'n' Low, that's what I want&quot;...or &quot;If you were in my toilet, I wouldn't bother to flush you&quot; or &quot;Protect my interests, and serve my needs&quot; and best of all...&quot;say it with me, 'do you want that in a loafer or a pump'...now good, because the only job you'll get in this town is selling shoes!&quot;.

189762,A1YC9XEDFKXPLK,1573624047,Armando M. Mesa,"[1, 1]","Before Office Space there was Swimming With Sharks. True,bothfilms deal with entirely different types of work industries (one ofcomputer software sales, the other the movie making machine ofHollywood). Even the background soundtrack music for Sharks serves asa dark and mencaing counterpoint to the humor. Listen carefully to thepiano keynotes played over and over;they stick in your head as anotation that this film will soon reveal a dark climax dealing morewith dramatics than humor. Yet, the premise is the same;the underdogwho works for a conniving cutthroat boss.The major difference is whereOffice Space goes strictly for the comedic jugular, Sharks just goesfor the comedic and thought provoking jugular. How much crap wouldanyone be willing to put up with at the expense of one's own dignityand self preservation just to meet the degrading and outrageousdemands set to satisfy the office superior's selfish,petty, andmeaningless needs ? One soon finds out when Guy, a film grad fromupstate New York, takes an intern job at Keystone Pictures to fulfilla childhood dream about movies based on a memory since seeing IndianaJones and The Last Crusade one summer...The other question remains,can Guy get out from underneath Buddy's thumb before he too becomes aclone of Buddy's and takes on the same detestable personality traitsand malignant/malicious work ethics ?...Whaley plays the part ofGuy to a perfect t as the puppy-eyed, naive go-for (gopher ?)for BuddyAckerman played convincingly,and with zest,by Kevin Spacey. Co-writtenor directed by Spacey you can see his natural flair and finesse forbeing quite comedic and sarcastic when his characters' antics areanything but for poor Guy.Spacey's facial expressions are pricelessand genuine (we know we've all seen that sarcastic look from someonein our personal and professional lives)...Dawn Lockhart, played byMichele Forbes, is another interesting subject for characterstudy.What does she really want other than to see her project go tofruition without strings attached from Buddy ? Is she really into theyoung,naive,sometimes dim-witted intern ?.Look for a great performanceby a young Benicio DelToro (Traffic,Snatch) as Rex, the&quot;seasoned&quot; intern/copy/coffee boy who shows Guy the ropes inthe office and how to put up with Buddy (...&quot;next time,anticipate and bring Buddy a Sweet &amp; Low and an Equal.&quot;Also,&quot;Serve his needs and protect his interests.&quot;).The onlynon-screen mystery character was Stella,another Keystone keyplayerexec often mentioned but never heard of or seen (even over thephone).Curious as to what actress would have played her and to whateffect...For the compressing or visual artifacts seen on this dvd Igive it only 3 stars.  The transfer is muddled by a lot of obviousdigital &quot;blocking&quot; or incoherent shading and&quot;stiff&quot; digitized unnatural action movement by thecharacters/actors and objects when in motion.This is all quite evidentwhen seen on a 27&quot; t.v. or huge direct view wide screent.v. (I've compared the two and saw enough flaws on the dvd transferthat should put the distributor or company to shame). Example; thereis a scene of a close-up of Buddy Ackerman's office orange wall motifwhere the bright orange color and shading values look mosaic ortiled. As for the sound quality, well, you gotta remember it's adialogue movie mostly.  Don't expect the glorious Dolby Digital 5-7surround channels to envelope you with thunderous, ear shatteringresults...Still, for the film's dark and sadistic comic streak andominous twist ending it's still a great feat to take in...",4,The Dark Side of Office Space...,982972800,"02 24, 2001",2001,3614,"['Office', 'Space', 'was', 'Swimming', 'Sharks', 'True', 'bothfilms', 'deal', 'entirely', 'different', 'types', 'work', 'industries', 'one', 'ofcomputer', 'software', 'sales', 'other', 'movie', 'making', 'machine', 'ofHollywood', 'Even', 'background', 'soundtrack', 'music', 'Sharks', 'asa', 'dark', 'mencaing', 'counterpoint', 'humor', 'Listen', 'carefully', 'thepiano', 'keynotes', 'played', 'stick', 'head', 'anotation', 'film', 'will', 'soon', 'reveal', 'dark', 'climax', 'dealing', 'morewith', 'dramatics', 'humor', 'premise', 'same', 'underdogwho', 'conniving', 'cutthroat', 'boss.The', 'major', 'difference', 'whereOffice', 'Space', 'strictly', 'comedic', 'jugular', 'Sharks', 'just', 'goesfor', 'comedic', 'thought', 'provoking', 'jugular', 'How', 'much', 'crap', 'wouldanyone', 'be', 'willing', 'put', 'up', 'expense', 'one', 'own', 'dignityand', 'preservation', 'just', 'meet', 'degrading', 'set', 'satisfy', 'office', 'superior', 'selfish', 'petty', 'andmeaningless', 'needs', 'One', 'soon', 'out', 'when', 'Guy', 'film', 'grad', 'fromupstate', 'New', 'York', 'intern', 'job', 'Keystone', 'Pictures', 'fulfilla', 'childhood', 'dream', 'movies', 'based', 'memory', 'seeing', 'IndianaJones', 'Last', 'Crusade', 'one', 'summer', 'other', 'question', 'can', 'Guy', 'get', 'out', 'underneath', 'Buddy', 'thumb', 'too', 'aclone', 'Buddy', 'same', 'detestable', 'personality', 'traitsand', 'malignant/malicious', 'work', 'ethics', 'Whaley', 'part', 'perfect', 't', 'puppy-eyed', 'naive', 'go-for', 'gopher', 'BuddyAckerman', 'played', 'convincingly', 'zest', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Co-writtenor', 'directed', 'Spacey', 'can', 'see', 'natural', 'flair', 'finesse', 'forbeing', 'quite', 'comedic', 'sarcastic', 'when', 'characters', 'antics', 'areanything', 'poor', 'Guy.Spacey', 'facial', 'expressions', 'are', 'pricelessand', 'genuine', 'know', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'sarcastic', 'look', 'someonein', 'personal', 'professional', 'lives', 'Dawn', 'Lockhart', 'played', 'byMichele', 'Forbes', 'interesting', 'subject', 'characterstudy.What', 'really', 'want', 'other', 'see', 'project', 'go', 'tofruition', 'strings', 'attached', 'Buddy', 'really', 'theyoung', 'naive', 'sometimes', 'dim-witted', 'intern', '.Look', 'great', 'performanceby', 'young', 'Benicio', 'DelToro', 'Traffic', 'Snatch', 'Rex', 'quot', 'seasoned', 'quot', 'boy', 'who', 'Guy', 'ropes', 'inthe', 'office', 'how', 'put', 'up', 'Buddy', 'quot', 'next', 'time', 'anticipate', 'bring', 'Buddy', 'Sweet', 'amp', 'Low', 'Equal.', 'quot', 'Also', 'quot', 'Serve', 'needs', 'protect', 'interests.', 'quot', 'onlynon-screen', 'mystery', 'character', 'was', 'Stella', 'Keystone', 'keyplayerexec', 'often', 'mentioned', 'never', 'heard', 'seen', 'even', 'thephone', '.Curious', 'what', 'actress', 'would', 'have', 'played', 'whateffect', 'compressing', 'visual', 'artifacts', 'seen', 'dvd', 'only', '3', 'stars', 'transfer', 'muddled', 'lot', 'obviousdigital', 'quot', 'blocking', 'quot', 'incoherent', 'shading', 'quot', 'stiff', 'quot', 'digitized', 'unnatural', 'action', 'movement', 'thecharacters/actors', 'objects', 'when', 'motion.This', 'quite', 'evidentwhen', 'seen', '27', 'quot', 't.v', 'huge', 'direct', 'view', 'wide', 'screent.v', ""'ve"", 'compared', 'two', 'saw', 'enough', 'flaws', 'dvd', 'should', 'put', 'distributor', 'company', 'shame', 'Example', 'scene', 'close-up', 'Buddy', 'Ackerman', 'office', 'orange', 'wall', 'motifwhere', 'bright', 'orange', 'color', 'shading', 'values', 'look', 'mosaic', 'ortiled', 'sound', 'quality', 'well', 'got', 'ta', 'remember', 'adialogue', 'movie', 'mostly', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'glorious', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5-7surround', 'channels', 'envelope', 'thunderous', 'ear', 'shatteringresults', 'Still', 'film', 'dark', 'sadistic', 'comic', 'streak', 'andominous', 'twist', 'ending', 'still', 'great', 'feat', 'take']",N/A

Some of these people regard themselves as the equivalent of demi-gods or priest-like figures, guarding the gates of the temple of the film/entertainment industry. They expect to be worshiped or at least revered, allowing only the initiated to pass through. Those who are given a chance to become initiates are sometimes subjected to a kind of hazing process in which the poor initiate is subjected to the whims of the high elites.Kevin Spacey plays Buddy Ackerman, the perfect Hollywood shark, a studio executive who believes everything he says and does should be viewed as &#34;gospel&#34; by those who work under him. Guy (Frank Whaley) is his new assistant, or better stated, his new whipping boy. Guy is greener than an unripe tomato, replacing Rex (Benicio del Toro) of whom Buddy says &#34;is a good for nothing mongoloid&#34; on the first day. But before the first day is over, Guy realizes that this is going to be long term abuse.Spacey makes the perfect vain studio executive. One of the best aspects of his performance is that he wavers between seeming reasonable then flying into rages which would give your average wolverine a runs for its money. He berates Guy for giving him the wrong artificial sweetener. He throws books and papers at him. Even occasionally food. He even makes his assistant embark on impossible tasks, such as destroying every single copy of a Time Magazine issue which contained a scathing article about him. Ackerman's motto is &#34;You are nothing. You're opinion means nothing&#34;.As book ends to the narrative, we flash to another part of the story: Guy has kidnapped Ackerman and has tied him. He's torturing him as payback. But the abuse is not the only reason Guy wants Buddy to suffer. As bad as Guy's mistreatment, the worst aspect is the executive's habit of taking credit for the deeds of others. In a poignant scene, Ackerman pretends to praise Guy to another executive, but Guy realizes it was false.A very interesting film, mostly for those who have either worked for or been associated with ego-maniacs. The movie industry is chock full of people who believe they are above everyone else because of certain successes. This gives some of them license to abuse others, particularly because so many desire what few positions are available. As Buddy himself says &#34;Life is not a movie. Good guys lose, everybody lies, and love... does not conquer all.&#34;",4,"If You Ever Worked in Hollywood, You May Relate to this Fantasy of a Minno Getting Revenge on a Shark",1392336000,"02 14, 2014",2014,2571,"['Hollywood', 'industry', 'saturated', 'who', 'dream', 'being', '34', '34', 'people', 'higher', 'levels', 'abuse', 'positions', 'power', 'people', 'regard', 'equivalent', 'demi-gods', 'priest-like', 'figures', 'guarding', 'gates', 'temple', 'film/entertainment', 'industry', 'expect', 'be', 'worshiped', 'least', 'revered', 'allowing', 'only', 'initiated', 'pass', 'who', 'are', 'given', 'chance', 'become', 'initiates', 'are', 'sometimes', 'subjected', 'kind', 'hazing', 'process', 'poor', 'initiate', 'subjected', 'whims', 'high', 'elites.Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Buddy', 'Ackerman', 'perfect', 'Hollywood', 'shark', 'studio', 'executive', 'who', 'everything', 'should', 'be', 'viewed', '34', 'gospel', '34', 'who', 'work', 'Guy', 'Frank', 'Whaley', 'new', 'assistant', 'better', 'stated', 'new', 'whipping', 'boy', 'Guy', 'greener', 'unripe', 'tomato', 'replacing', 'Rex', 'Benicio', 'del', 'Toro', 'whom', 'Buddy', '34', 'good', 'nothing', 'mongoloid', '34', 'first', 'day', 'first', 'day', 'Guy', 'going', 'be', 'long', 'term', 'abuse.Spacey', 'perfect', 'vain', 'studio', 'executive', 'One', 'best', 'aspects', 'performance', 'seeming', 'reasonable', 'then', 'flying', 'rages', 'would', 'give', 'average', 'wolverine', 'runs', 'money', 'Guy', 'giving', 'wrong', 'artificial', 'sweetener', 'books', 'papers', 'Even', 'occasionally', 'food', 'even', 'assistant', 'embark', 'impossible', 'tasks', 'such', 'destroying', 'single', 'copy', 'Time', 'Magazine', 'issue', 'contained', 'scathing', 'article', 'Ackerman', 'motto', '34', 'are', 'nothing', ""'re"", 'opinion', 'means', 'nothing', '34', '.As', 'book', 'narrative', 'flash', 'part', 'story', 'Guy', 'kidnapped', 'Ackerman', 'tied', 'torturing', 'payback', 'abuse', 'not', 'only', 'reason', 'Guy', 'Buddy', 'suffer', 'As', 'bad', 'Guy', 'mistreatment', 'worst', 'aspect', 'executive', 'habit', 'taking', 'credit', 'deeds', 'others', 'poignant', 'scene', 'Ackerman', 'praise', 'Guy', 'executive', 'Guy', 'was', 'false.A', 'very', 'interesting', 'film', 'mostly', 'who', 'have', 'worked', 'been', 'associated', 'ego-maniacs', 'movie', 'industry', 'chock', 'full', 'people', 'who', 'believe', 'are', 'everyone', 'else', 'certain', 'successes', 'license', 'abuse', 'others', 'particularly', 'so', 'many', 'desire', 'what', 'few', 'positions', 'are', 'available', 'Buddy', '34', 'Life', 'not', 'movie', 'Good', 'guys', 'lose', 'everybody', 'love', 'not', 'conquer', 'all.', '34']",N/A

189769,ASKUZHOKQ1W3E,1573624047,"Dane R. Youssef ""surfur""","[0, 2]","by Dane YoussefNow here is a movie for those looking for an attack on white-collar corporate office life, the spinning gears of Hollywood. And not overblown with big-budget special effects, scatological humor and saccarine-coated deluded big-screen implausibilities. For those looking for something really strongly written by a veteran of it's field and performed by pure-blooded thespains in the low-budget indie vein.""Swimming With Sharks"" seems to owe more than a little something to ""Dilbert."" The movie is more about Corporate America than Hollywood. There are a lot of white-collar touches that apply to offices, cublicles and other such rather than the Hollywood spin machine. Like Robert Altman's ""The Player,"" this is one of those thrillers about people in ""the biz"" who are driven to the breaking point by how cruel L.A. can really be.The film's writer/director George Huang himself was a former personal assistant to some of the biggest names in Hollywood, has described the movie as ""20% autobiographical."" Much of this one is said to be based on his experience working for noted mega-mogul producer Joel Silver for Columbia Pictures. So it should come as no surprise what-so-*****ing-ever that his first crack at film was his own life story.Surprise, surprise, huh?Well, more or less.A critical darling, unseen by most of the world and known mostly for the blistering, superb performance of two-time Oscar-winner Kevin Spacey.But despite Kevin Spacey being the big name in this movie and him getting first-billing because of it, Frank Whaley (""The Doors"" and ""Career Opportunities"") is the star of this one. Most of anything with him headling is a sign of a bad movie (""Cold Dog Soup"" and ""The Jimmy Show"") , but this is one of those where he shines because he's allowed to. He's not the most versative actor, the best-looking or the most charismatic. He's had a rep as being something of the life-long ""bit player."" But when he's given a movie, script and part which allows him any headway, he damn well manages to make the most of it.Spacey, being one of Hollywood's finest and renown, is able to pull off the screaming antagonistic drill-instructor and the restrained, tortured hostage here pitch perfectly. Whaley effectively plays the green and naive wide-eyed rookie to the Hollywood spin machine with his usual perfection, but when the other shoe drops, he doesn't quite pull off the scorned, disgruntled employee seeking revenge. His Jeckyll isn't as convincing as his Hyde. He doesn't scare us. He never seems truly unhinged. Maybe that's why Whaley sticks to the youthful deer-in-the-headlights. He's just believable. When it comes to acting, you judge a book by it's cover. Whaley doesn't really seem as demented and unhinged as he should in his captor scenes. He's best as a whipping boy--whcih is why he plays so many.1994 was the official year for Spacey. He got his breakout with the TV series ""Wiseguys,"" and made the big screen transition with worthwhile fare like his Oscar-winning supporting role in ""The Usual Suspects,"" ""The Ref,"" ""Se7en"" and this. Spacey monopolized himself in the '94 as ""absolute talent"" (my term).Geez, after seeing what a softball he was in ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" and ""The Usual Suspects"" who would've guessed the same actor could pull off such a corporate monster?Well, I guess we all would have. Every time, you see him act, he has that way of letting you know he make you believe in every single role.Benecio Del Toro, the ""Brad Pitt of Mexico"" (someone else's quote, believe me, I never dubbed him such) has a quickie cameo as Spacey's assistant who's given his three weeks notice and is on the way out, making way for Guy. But not before giving Whaley some final parting words of wisdom. ""Protect his interests, serve his needs. What you think means nothing. What you feel means nothing. You have no brain. He yells all the time. It's a lose-lose situation."" This job is a fast-track shortcut to the top and if Guy does right and keeps his mouth open wide enough to catch all of Buddy's crap, he may very well be someday on the same mantel as Buddy and his former assistants. Everything Guy'll ever need to know about his job, he learns on day one.Enter Dawn Locklard (Michelle Forbes of ""Guiding Light"" and ""24""), another powerful Hollywood producer who Guy doesn't have the best first meeting with. She doesn't show a lot of warmth, which explains why she's a producer.She herself is angry and cycnical, and throughout the course of the film, we will see why. She eventually warms up to Guy and asks him out. Guy is stunned. But she needs Buddy on her side and is interested in him getting behind her new project. Guy sees this as an opporunity. Her new project for the studio, ""Real Life""may just be Guy's window of opportunity. She seems to be interested in Guy because he's the most real thing she's seen in the Valley for the longest time. But does she really feel something for him or is she just using him? Is Buddy two-faced and back-stabbing or is Dawn? Guy no longer knows what's real and what's what?At first, we don't realize Buddy just likes to yell and scream and humiliate no matter what. Well, unless you've seen the trailers. e just likes to rant. You will never again confuse a packet of Sweet 'N' Low with Equal again. You'll never look at sugar packets the same way. This is perhaps the funniest moment in the movie. Although when Guy starts to show some spine after a lot of Buddy's tantrums, the payoff is almost evenly matched with the artifical sugar scene. Buddy gets to emotionally, verbally (and at times, physically) abuses Guy (and apparently all his assistant's) on every possible ocassion. He also gets to skewer just about everyone who crosses his path.Kevin Spacey's rans are hilarious. We dont know whether to laugh at Spacey or feel bad for Whaley. Often, we don't know if the horrific hostage-stiuation quite works as well as the corporate office scenes.And Kevin Spacey brings his trademark dry cynicsm and sardonic behavior to what could have been a limited one-dimensional bullying manager. But Spacey plays the character for all it's worth and then some and turns him into a memorable antagonist who is one of the sole reasons this movie has a reputation and cult following.""Swimming With Sharks"" isn't just a featherweight comedy for a slow Saturday night about a bullying boss like the trailer may lead you to believe. It's a non-cronological film which deals with white-collar office comedy and torturous drama. Shifting from a lightweight comedy to a torturous thriller. It's sort of schizophrenic thing. We're laughing heartily one minute and horrified the next. A lot of time, this one keeps us guessing as it criss-crosses from Buddy torturing Guy to vice-versa.The whole fiim is so reliant on it's writing and acting, it was adapted into a play premiering at London's Vaudeville Theatre in 2007, featuring Christian Slater, Matt Smith and Helen Baxendale. Ys, plays can be adapted into movies and vice-versa. The movie works like the theatre or an actor's workshop, relying mostly on performance and dialouge. Spacey seems to prefer doing this type of work, judging by his resume. It's fun for actor's and it forces them to rely on their own raw talent, letting you know exactly where they stand.But there's a lot to this movie (maybe too much) about this movie that rings true to life. A lot of moments filled with the harsh insights and disillusioned truths that one learns from living an uncharmed life. And so theres illuminating light and lessons, as well as laughs. Not to mention some great acting from the heavier moments where ugly secrets about Buddy and... well, surprisingly Dawn are revealed.The plot is over-developed and the ending is more poetic than anything else.But most of the movie really does does work and really does sticks with you... like all the great ones do.--Hoo-Ray For Coporate Hollywood, Dane Youssefdanessf@yahoo.com",4,The Inside

This is the sacrificial corporate abuse movie to end them all.It's very dark, gritty, vile, degrading, and pervasive. Buddy Ackerman (Spacey) is the film equivalent of someone like Roger Smith from General Motors. He is a tyrant, who doesnt care about anyone but himself. Enter Guy (Frank Whaley) who starts to dibble in his affairs while trying to scratch and crawl to the top and well you have a war brewing.This film is about one jerk with too much power who uses that power to abuse and blackmail people (including Whaley's girlfriend played by the beautiful Michelle Forbes).The best part I can say is that the characters are real, Spacey plays the worst boss in the world (in the real world he'd be fired) who works at a Film company. Like any dictator boss, he has people who run errands for him and well act like puppets for him. Whaley is Guy who pitches a great idea for a movie and Spacey steals it for his advantage along with trying to use Whaley's girlfriend.The rest of the film deals with Whaley abusing Buddy (God I loved those parts) by any means possible The ending though leaves you unsatisfied.If you havent seen the ending here I wont give it away. The movie endings leaves it open for interpretation. Has Guy really succeeded or is he just another new member of abusive corporate bosses in the making?The ending also  makes you think though maybe there was some sort of homophobic element the writers were thinking.Still this movie is a classic its no surprise, Spacey went on to do ""Seven"", ""The Usual Suspects"" and many more hits.",5,A very interesting movie about  corporate abuse,1094515200,"09 7, 2004",2004,1686,"['Want', 'see', 'where', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'mastery', 'villian', 'started', 'Look', 'further', '1994', 'Swimming', 'Sharks', 'George', 'Huang', 'sacrificial', 'corporate', 'abuse', 'movie', 'end', 'all.It', 'very', 'dark', 'gritty', 'vile', 'degrading', 'pervasive', 'Buddy', 'Ackerman', 'Spacey', 'film', 'equivalent', 'someone', 'Roger', 'Smith', 'General', 'Motors', 'tyrant', 'who', 'care', 'anyone', 'Enter', 'Guy', 'Frank', 'Whaley', 'who', 'dibble', 'affairs', 'trying', 'scratch', 'crawl', 'top', 'well', 'have', 'war', 'brewing.This', 'film', 'one', 'jerk', 'too', 'much', 'power', 'who', 'power', 'abuse', 'blackmail', 'people', 'including', 'Whaley', 'girlfriend', 'played', 'beautiful', 'Michelle', 'Forbes', '.The', 'best', 'part', 'can', 'say', 'characters', 'are', 'real', 'Spacey', 'worst', 'boss', 'world', 'real', 'world', ""'d"", 'be', 'fired', 'who', 'Film', 'company', 'dictator', 'boss', 'people', 'who', 'run', 'errands', 'well', 'act', 'puppets', 'Whaley', 'Guy', 'who', 'great', 'idea', 'movie', 'Spacey', 'steals', 'advantage', 'trying', 'use', 'Whaley', 'girlfriend.The', 'rest', 'film', 'deals', 'Whaley', 'abusing', 'Buddy', 'God', 'loved', 'parts', 'means', 'possible', 'ending', 'leaves', 'unsatisfied.If', 'havent', 'seen', 'ending', 'here', 'wont', 'give', 'away', 'movie', 'open', 'interpretation', 'Has', 'Guy', 'really', 'succeeded', 'just', 'new', 'member', 'abusive', 'corporate', 'bosses', 'making', 'ending', 'also', 'think', 'maybe', 'was', 'sort', 'homophobic', 'element', 'writers', 'were', 'thinking.Still', 'movie', 'classic', 'surprise', 'Spacey', 'went', 'do', 'Seven', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'many', 'more', 'hits']",N/A

That person who is essentially his only ticket in happens to be an incarnation of the devil himself. Frank Whaley is Guy, a recent film school grad who is more than eager to get into showbiz, his new boss is Buddy Ackerman (Kevin Spacey, in a role that's better than Lester Burnham), an evil, manipulative, cold, and bitter two faced Hollywood player who is 98% evil and 2% good. &quot;Swimming With Sharks&quot; follows a year in the life of Guy as his spirit is destroyed by a man he fantasizes about murdering. It works on a 50/50 level with the comedic flashbacks to a dramatic story. Kevin Spacey chews every scene that he's in and Frank Whaley is the perfect foil as the naive lead character. Huang's script focuses on the complex relationship between these two men as the one above continually crushes his spirit...but with good reason. An underrated film that didn't even get a run in theaters, &quot;Swimming With Sharks&quot; is a truly original film that is actually based on director Huang's experience on the Hollywood ladder.

189802,AD0J5KK4WQXNS,1573624047,OverTheMoon,"[1, 2]","""Swimming with Sharks"" is a film that strives to do well considering its limitations and eventually succeeds by a wonderful powerhouse performance from Kevin Spacey. The film essentially has been given a boost by actors who where relative unknowns for their time - Spacey, Del Toro and Whaley. This would have been your average low-budget TV film about Hollywood if Spacey and Del Toro where not there. The script itself has been written for budget restrictions. Nearly all the movie takes place inside a business office. The film does suffer from looking like a high-end production that ends up being bad, but is in fact a low-end production that ends up being good. It depends on which angle you take it from and mainly because this film was released in mass after Spacey became well known through films like ""The Usual Suspects"" and ""Seven"". Many people found it a great movie but lacking the kind of budget they expected. Yes, this movie could be described as some of those more ""unknown"" films that suddenly pop out from nowhere when an actor breaks into the big time like all those early films which claim to show a nude Leo DeCaprio. It does fit into the category or ""resurrected early works"".However ""Swimming with Sharks"" is actually a very good movie about an extremely simple premise. Film producer executive from hell hires an assistant who he proceeds to psychologically rip apart at any given opportunity. Assistant looses the plot and plans to torture his boss to death. Its the sort of film that has mass appeal because people can relate to it. Spacey is excellent as the sadistic producer and Whaley is good, but not great, as the tortured assistant turning torturer - literally.There is a sub-plot about a woman director who moves between the two men and the ending is somewhat unrealistic or surreal but not totally out of place. The ending is darker than the rest of the film which is more comical in nature. Even for all its misfires and dud plot lines this is a film that should be watched for Spacey doing the horrible boss routine and for that alone the film can be forgiven for all its more minor mistakes.Simply Spacey.",4,Amateurish in many ways but its does pull through,1067126400,"10 26, 2003",2003,2145,"['Swimming', 'Sharks', 'film', 'do', 'well', 'considering', 'limitations', 'eventually', 'wonderful', 'powerhouse', 'performance', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'film', 'essentially', 'been', 'given', 'boost', 'actors', 'who', 'where', 'relative', 'unknowns', 'time', 'Spacey', 'Del', 'Toro', 'Whaley', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'average', 'low-budget', 'TV', 'film', 'Hollywood', 'Spacey', 'Del', 'Toro', 'where', 'not', 'there', 'script', 'been', 'written', 'budget', 'restrictions', 'Nearly', 'movie', 'place', 'business', 'office', 'film', 'suffer', 'looking', 'high-end', 'production', 'up', 'being', 'bad', 'fact', 'low-end', 'production', 'up', 'being', 'good', 'angle', 'take', 'mainly', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'mass', 'Spacey', 'became', 'well', 'known', 'films', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'Seven', 'Many', 'people', 'found', 'great', 'movie', 'lacking', 'kind', 'budget', 'expected', 'Yes', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'described', 'more', 'unknown', 'films', 'suddenly', 'out', 'nowhere', 'when', 'actor', 'breaks', 'big', 'time', 'early', 'films', 'claim', 'show', 'nude', 'Leo', 'DeCaprio', 'fit', 'category', 'resurrected', 'early', 'works', '.However', 'Swimming', 'Sharks', 'actually', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'extremely', 'simple', 'premise', 'Film', 'producer', 'executive', 'hell', 'assistant', 'who', 'psychologically', 'rip', 'apart', 'given', 'opportunity', 'Assistant', 'plot', 'plans', 'torture', 'boss', 'death', 'sort', 'film', 'mass', 'appeal', 'people', 'can', 'relate', 'Spacey', 'excellent', 'sadistic', 'producer', 'Whaley', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'tortured', 'assistant', 'turning', 'torturer', 'literally.There', 'sub-plot', 'woman', 'director', 'who', 'two', 'men', 'ending', 'somewhat', 'unrealistic', 'surreal', 'not', 'totally', 'place', 'ending', 'darker', 'rest', 'film', 'more', 'comical', 'nature', 'Even', 'misfires', 'dud', 'plot', 'lines', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'watched', 'Spacey', 'doing', 'horrible', 'boss', 'routine', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'forgiven', 'more', 'minor', 'mistakes.Simply', 'Spacey']",N/A

For example, ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" plays with quirky characters and also unpleasant memories of a hurt family.  In the end, it chose to be a heart-warming movie with a biting edge.""Swimming With Sharks,"" an unforgettable satire of workplace politics, is a movie that is caught dead in the middle.  You'd think that would be a sign of perfection, but it actually becomes a frustrating experience.Guy (played by the underrated Frank Whaley) is a movie fanatic who wants to make it big in the industry, but is soon blindsided, then painfully enlightened, by executive boss Buddy Ackerman (Kevin Spacey, who could not have done any better with this role).  Along the way, he meets a cold writer/producer who at first condescends Guy, but then the two form a love relationship amidst the crazy politics.The movie actually opens with Guy becoming fed up with Buddy's antics and hauntingly promises, ""It's payback time."", and then chronicles both backward and forward.I'll first address the movie's undeniable strengths.  There are many lessons of life that will strike a hard, yet truthful, note.  Ideas versus Reality, kissing ass-before-kicking it, the importance of learning one's true goals.  You will not forget the philosphies that ""Swimming With Sharks"" presents to you.  Whaley and Spacey are brilliant here.  They have perfect timing with their dialogue and chemistry (if you can call this abusive relationship that), and don't wink to the camera or go insanely over-the-top.Now for the faults.  I actually don't mind the flashback technique that I usually dislike.  It's definitely the correct approach for this movie.  But huge contrast between the workplace insanity of the past and the torture/reflection sequences of the present are jarring.  Maybe a man like Guy really would snap, but this is a painful contrast that is difficult to absorb.  Now, I can forgive that because the ground-covered from the beginning to the end is supposed to be a long road-trip.  But when Guy and Buddy bicker back-and-forth about the meaning of life, you'd wish they would both just shoot themselves and get it over with.  Both are obviously troubled individuals, but enough is enough.  ""Swimming With Sharks"" doesn't know when to let go because it's so hell-bent on getting the point across.Strangely enough, the music is fitting, but also very annoying.  The score has some monotonous rhythms that give a message reaffirming ""This really is a dark movie!""  I get it...enough already!Maybe the perfectly-balanced dark comedy can't be made, because ""Swimming With Sharks"" is defintely the most middle-of-the-road I've ever seen.  My conclusion regarding this dilemma is this: Perhaps this isn't the right topic to tackle.  Movies and films possess such a knack for visual style and storytelling that maybe we don't need to ""WATCH"" this dark tale.  Because movies require some degree of sympathy with the characters, and because ""Swimming With Sharks"" has so many unlikeable traits, maybe this one shouldn't have been about movies to begin with.This movie acheives what it wants to, and is very well-made and has great acting.  However, just because ""Swimming With Sharks"" accomplishes what it wants to do, doesn't mean that it's a rewarding experience.

Thus begins ""Swimming With Sharks,"" a veritable survival  guide for those who would venture into the cold and often dangerous waters  of film making.  Guy is a recent film school graduate who has landed a job  at Keystone Pictures as the gofer assistant to none other than the  legendary power player Buddy Ackerman (Played exuberantly by Kevin Spacey),  one of the top producers at Keystone.  Guy is replacing Rex (Benicio Del  Toro) who is leaving to take a position at Paramount.  During Guy's  orientation on his first day, Rex tells him ""This in not a business, this  is show business.  Punching below the belt in not only alright, it's  rewarded,"" and with that, the tone is set for much of what follows.  But  not everything.  Buddy, we quickly learn, is the boss nobody would ever  want. At his best, he is unpleasant; at his worst, which is most of the  time, he is abusive in the extreme.  He seems to take perverse delight in  assigning Catch-22 directives to his underlings (He tells Guy to hold his  calls while he is in a meeting; when Guy doesn't put the calls through he  is admonished for it).  His most prolific tool of management is the  beguiling phrase ""Shut up, listen, and learn,"" which he applies frequently  to the hapless Guy.  Of course, there is  only so much one man can take, and early on we realize that Guy is in the  process of exacting his revenge.  Through flashbacks the story unfolds, and  Guy's motivation becomes crystal clear.  A situation to which many can  relate, it is readily understandable how he has arrived at the position in  which he finds himself with Buddy, and  when you realize that Guy has  crossed that line beyond which there is no return it evokes that sense of  loss one feels for the doomed, and you wonder why things have to be like  this.  In ""Swimming With Sharks,""  writer and first time director George Huang serves up a delectable sampling  of the smorgasbord that is Hollywood, complete with the bitters he adds to  the twist at the end, which may leave you somewhat taken aback.

189812,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,1573624047,Scott Schiefelbein,"[17, 21]","Kevin Spacey has emerged as one of America's leading actors in the past few years: &quot;Swimming With Sharks&quot; is a delightful exhibition of his unique blend of sarcasm, viciousness, and versatility.  Few characters  could be as much fun for an actor to play as Barry Ackerman, the immoral,  hedonistic, abuse-spewing film executive idealistic young Guy toils away  for.  Spacey takes obvious relish in lines such as &quot;Her phone bills  are more than your rent,&quot; &quot;He's not dead; he's just . . .  unavailable,&quot; and particularly, &quot;If you were in my toilet, I  wouldn't bother to flush you.&quot;Guy, an idealistic young film  graduate, has somehow landed one of the cream jobs in Hollywood as  assistant to Ackerman.  How he got the job is a mystery, as Guy seems to  have no idea of what goes on in the movie business and has not met Ackerman  before.  Guy can speak movingly about the movies he watched in his youth --  maybe that's enough to become a mini-mogul in Hollywood these days.  Michelle Forbes' Dawn, a producer, inexplicably falls for Guy, although we  are supposed to believe that this beautiful, rich, powerful woman is  attracted to Guy's honesty and naivete.  Funny how those traits work on  beautiful, rich, powerful women in the movies.The movie bounces back and  forth between Guy getting his revenge on Barry for the hell he's gone  through as Barry's lackey and the flashback shots of Guy's humiliating  experiences.  Throughout the movie we are treated to little Hollywood  inside jokes (for example, the &quot;hot young director&quot; in the movie  is Foster Kane, the name of Orson Welles' infamous protagonist in  &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;).  An enjoyable trip through the dark side of the  movie business, &quot;Sharks&quot; contains just enough reality to keep the  more outlandish plot developments grounded.  Not as savage as &quot;In the  Company of Men,&quot; and not as complex as &quot;The Player,&quot;  &quot;Swimming With Shars&quot; is nevertheless a solid ninety minutes that  will sustain Kevin Spacey fans who have watched &quot;The Usual  Suspects,&quot; &quot;Se7en,&quot; &quot;American Beauty,&quot; or  &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot; too many times.Be warned: the videotape  is of poor quality and may wear out more quickly than other high-budget  releases.",4,A must for Kevin Spacey fans and Hollywood Insider Wannabes,964656000,"07 27, 2000",2000,2330,"['Kevin', 'Spacey', 'emerged', 'one', 'America', 'leading', 'actors', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'quot', 'Swimming', 'Sharks', 'quot', 'delightful', 'exhibition', 'unique', 'blend', 'sarcasm', 'viciousness', 'versatility', 'Few', 'characters', 'could', 'be', 'as', 'much', 'fun', 'actor', 'play', 'Barry', 'Ackerman', 'immoral', 'hedonistic', 'abuse-spewing', 'film', 'executive', 'idealistic', 'young', 'Guy', 'away', 'Spacey', 'obvious', 'relish', 'lines', 'such', 'quot', 'phone', 'bills', 'are', 'more', 'rent', 'quot', 'quot', 'not', 'dead', 'just', 'unavailable', 'quot', 'particularly', 'quot', 'were', 'toilet', 'would', ""n't"", 'bother', 'flush', 'you.', 'quot', 'Guy', 'idealistic', 'young', 'film', 'graduate', 'somehow', 'landed', 'one', 'cream', 'jobs', 'Hollywood', 'assistant', 'Ackerman', 'How', 'got', 'job', 'mystery', 'Guy', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'movie', 'business', 'not', 'met', 'Ackerman', 'Guy', 'can', 'speak', 'movingly', 'movies', 'watched', 'youth', 'maybe', 'enough', 'become', 'mini-mogul', 'Hollywood', 'days', 'Michelle', 'Forbes', 'Dawn', 'producer', 'inexplicably', 'Guy', 'are', 'supposed', 'believe', 'beautiful', 'rich', 'powerful', 'woman', 'attracted', 'Guy', 'honesty', 'naivete', 'Funny', 'how', 'traits', 'work', 'beautiful', 'rich', 'powerful', 'women', 'movies.The', 'movie', 'back', 'forth', 'Guy', 'getting', 'revenge', 'Barry', 'hell', 'gone', 'Barry', 'lackey', 'flashback', 'shots', 'Guy', 'humiliating', 'experiences', 'movie', 'are', 'treated', 'little', 'Hollywood', 'jokes', 'example', 'quot', 'hot', 'young', 'director', 'quot', 'movie', 'Foster', 'Kane', 'name', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'infamous', 'protagonist', 'quot', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'quot', 'enjoyable', 'trip', 'dark', 'side', 'movie', 'business', 'quot', 'Sharks', 'quot', 'just', 'enough', 'reality', 'keep', 'more', 'outlandish', 'plot', 'developments', 'grounded', 'Not', 'as', 'savage', 'quot', 'Company', 'Men', 'quot', 'not', 'as', 'complex', 'quot', 'Player', 'quot', 'quot', 'Swimming', 'Shars', 'quot', 'nevertheless', 'solid', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'will', 'sustain', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'fans', 'who', 'have', 'watched', 'quot', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'quot', 'quot', 'Se7en', 'quot', 'quot', 'American', 'Beauty', 'quot', 'quot', 'Glengarry', 'Glen', 'Ross', 'quot', 'too', 'many', 'times.Be', 'warned', 'videotape', 'poor', 'quality', 'may', 'wear', 'out', 'more', 'quickly', 'other', 'high-budget', 'releases']",N/A

189817,A2K0KFEUZE0K0Q,1573624047,Sparky Lightbulb,"[2, 2]","When ""Swimming with Sharks"" opens, paramedics are depositing a sheet-draped body in an ambulance. The audience knows that someone has made a bad decision, for the police presence in the residential neighborhood means a homicide, not a heart attack. To explain what has happened, writer/director George Huang uses a series of flashbacks. From these, we learn that Guy (Frank Whaley), a lowly assistant to a powerful Hollywood executive, must choose between power and art.The first flashback depicts the previous evening when Guy reaches the breaking point. His boss Buddy Ackerman (Kevin Spacey) is ready to fire him, and this news inspires Guy to take Buddy hostage. Guy waves a gun and declares, ""It's payback time,"" and we expect a goofy revolt like the one secretaries stage in ""9 to 5."" The next flashback is Guy's first day at work a year earlier. Here we gain two important insights: On the one hand, Buddy is a nightmare boss; he flaunts his power to make or break careers and insults the underlings. But we also learn from world-weary Rex (Benicio Del Toro), Buddy's former assistant, that if Guy can tolerate the abuse, he will eventually win a powerful position in the movie industry. The rest of the film bounces between the escalating violence during Buddy's kidnapping--we are soon thinking Stephen King's ""Misery"" rather than ""9 to 5""--and the small and large indignities heaped on Guy during his year of servitude. The power Buddy wields is seductive, and he teases Guy with a taste, exclaiming, ""You and I are going to run this place"" after Guy reworks a script for a potential blockbuster.Guy has a second powerful force in his life, his lover Dawn Lockard (Michelle Forbes). The relationship begins with a tongue-lashing when Dawn finds Guy in her parking spot. Once she realizes that Guy works for Buddy, she takes him out for drinks to apologize; as she admits, she needs her calls to get on Buddy's phone sheet, which Guy now controls. Next, she takes the young assistant to bed, charmed after Guy explains the powerful tangle of movies and memories. Like Guy, Dawn suffered professional hazing while climbing the show business ladder. Now a producer with power of her own, Dawn tries to get Guy to avoid the mistakes she made. She wants him to hone his talents as a writer, not a sycophant. Muse-like, Dawn hopes to inspire Guy to make art, not deals.Guy's final decision between these two people is so shocking that the movie benefits from a second viewing. Then you can appreciate the loving attention to detail and craft. When the credits roll, you realize that Huang has depicted a busy office in a frantic town with a cast of nine and a handful of well-placed extras. Watch for costuming changes that indicate character development. For example, Guy begins the job with a cowlick and a tied tongue, but as he masters the skills necessary to assist Buddy, he becomes the smooth talker with slick hair. Or watch Dawn go from power bitch, blasting Guy about the parking spot (in an otherwise empty lot), to Zen master in an office-appropriate, wide-sleeved Buddhist ""robe"" as she attempts to steer her grasshopper away from the authority and affluence Buddy is dangling. Spacey is a master of transitions. Observe how one moment his Buddy is an affable, loose-muscled, enthusiastic manager, and then the next his eyes grow cold, his face freezes, his voice slows as he remembers that the other human being in the room has the importance (or intelligence) of a paperclip.A second viewing will also let you hear with new insight. Tom Hiel's score, with lots of high-note piano, mimics the way Buddy's abuse plucks Guy's nerves. Abundant dialogue clues indicate the surprising conclusion to come. Listen closely, for example, to Dawn. Like the Oracle at Delphi (but with less ambiguity), she announces the future: ""You're going to make a killing in this business.""A real delight about ""Swimming with Sharks"" is that Huang, himself an assistant to Hollywood executives, obviously resisted the temptation of power, with all of its left-brain scheming, for he created the art that is this movie.",4,Bad Decisions Make Great Movies,1263945600,"01 20, 2010",2010,4113,"['When', 'Swimming', 'Sharks', 'paramedics', 'are', 'depositing', 'sheet-draped', 'body', 'ambulance', 'audience', 'someone', 'made', 'bad', 'decision', 'police', 'presence', 'residential', 'neighborhood', 'homicide', 'not', 'heart', 'attack', 'explain', 'what', 'happened', 'writer/director', 'George', 'Huang', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'learn', 'Guy', 'Frank', 'Whaley', 'lowly', 'assistant', 'powerful', 'Hollywood', 'executive', 'must', 'choose', 'power', 'art.The', 'first', 'flashback', 'previous', 'evening', 'when', 'Guy', 'breaking', 'point', 'boss', 'Buddy', 'Ackerman', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'ready', 'fire', 'news', 'Guy', 'take', 'Buddy', 'hostage', 'Guy', 'gun', 'declares', 'payback', 'time', 'expect', 'goofy', 'revolt', 'one', 'secretaries', 'stage', '9', '5', 'next', 'flashback', 'Guy', 'first', 'day', 'work', 'year', 'earlier', 'Here', 'gain', 'two', 'important', 'insights', 'one', 'hand', 'Buddy', 'nightmare', 'boss', 'power', 'make', 'break', 'careers', 'insults', 'underlings', 'also', 'learn', 'world-weary', 'Rex', 'Benicio', 'Del', 'Toro', 'Buddy', 'former', 'assistant', 'Guy', 'can', 'tolerate', 'abuse', 'will', 'eventually', 'win', 'powerful', 'position', 'movie', 'industry', 'rest', 'film', 'bounces', 'escalating', 'violence', 'Buddy', 'kidnapping', 'are', 'soon', 'thinking', 'Stephen', 'King', 'Misery', 'rather', '9', '5', 'small', 'large', 'indignities', 'heaped', 'Guy', 'year', 'servitude', 'power', 'Buddy', 'wields', 'seductive', 'Guy', 'taste', 'exclaiming', 'are', 'going', 'run', 'place', 'Guy', 'script', 'potential', 'blockbuster.Guy', 'second', 'powerful', 'force', 'life', 'lover', 'Dawn', 'Lockard', 'Michelle', 'Forbes', 'relationship', 'tongue-lashing', 'when', 'Dawn', 'Guy', 'parking', 'spot', 'Guy', 'Buddy', 'out', 'drinks', 'apologize', 'calls', 'get', 'Buddy', 'phone', 'sheet', 'Guy', 'now', 'Next', 'young', 'assistant', 'bed', 'charmed', 'Guy', 'powerful', 'tangle', 'movies', 'memories', 'Guy', 'Dawn', 'suffered', 'professional', 'hazing', 'climbing', 'show', 'business', 'ladder', 'Now', 'producer', 'power', 'own', 'Dawn', 'get', 'Guy', 'avoid', 'mistakes', 'made', 'hone', 'talents', 'writer', 'not', 'sycophant', 'Muse-like', 'Dawn', 'inspire', 'Guy', 'make', 'art', 'not', 'deals.Guy', 'final', 'decision', 'two', 'people', 'so', 'shocking', 'movie', 'benefits', 'second', 'viewing', 'Then', 'can', 'appreciate', 'loving', 'attention', 'detail', 'craft', 'When', 'credits', 'roll', 'realize', 'Huang', 'depicted', 'busy', 'office', 'frantic', 'town', 'cast', 'nine', 'handful', 'well-placed', 'extras', 'Watch', 'costuming', 'changes', 'indicate', 'character', 'development', 'example', 'Guy', 'job', 'cowlick', 'tied', 'tongue', 'skills', 'necessary', 'assist', 'Buddy', 'smooth', 'talker', 'slick', 'hair', 'watch', 'Dawn', 'go', 'power', 'bitch', 'blasting', 'Guy', 'parking', 'spot', 'otherwise', 'empty', 'lot', 'Zen', 'master', 'office-appropriate', 'wide-sleeved', 'Buddhist', 'robe', 'steer', 'grasshopper', 'away', 'authority', 'affluence', 'Buddy', 'dangling', 'Spacey', 'master', 'transitions', 'Observe', 'how', 'one', 'moment', 'Buddy', 'affable', 'loose-muscled', 'enthusiastic', 'manager', 'then', 'next', 'eyes', 'grow', 'cold', 'face', 'freezes', 'voice', 'other', 'human', 'being', 'room', 'importance', 'intelligence', 'paperclip.A', 'second', 'viewing', 'will', 'also', 'let', 'hear', 'new', 'insight', 'Tom', 'Hiel', 'score', 'lots', 'high-note', 'piano', 'mimics', 'way', 'Buddy', 'abuse', 'Guy', 'nerves', 'Abundant', 'dialogue', 'clues', 'indicate', 'surprising', 'conclusion', 'come', 'Listen', 'closely', 'example', 'Dawn', 'Oracle', 'Delphi', 'less', 'ambiguity', 'future', ""'re"", 'going', 'make', 'killing', 'business', 'real', 'delight', 'Swimming', 'Sharks', 'Huang', 'assistant', 'Hollywood', 'executives', 'obviously', 'resisted', 'temptation', 'power', 'left-brain', 'scheming', 'created', 'art', 'movie']",N/A

I rented it at Blockbuster because it starred Kevin Spacey and I think there was some comparison to Robert Altman's The Player, which I loved.  I was unprepared for what I got.  First, you have Spacey, my favorite actor currently working today in one  of his most brilliant performances ever.  I think his turn as Mel Proffit  on Wiseguy is the only job he has done that I like better.  Next,  you have Frank Whaley, a talented young actor who slips between extremes of  timid uncertainty at the beginning of his job with Buddy, to icy cool  professionalism toward the end.  He also shows a warm caring side with his  girlfriend (played very smartly by the sexy Michelle Forbes) as well as a  psychotic off the deep end side when he takes Spacey's character hostage.  I loved it on first viewing.  I found a used copy of it about a month  later and purchased it immediately.  I have watched this film about 25  times in the last 5 years, and it never gets old.  It is fresh and blackly  funny every time I watch it.  One thing that I have noticed on many  repeat viewings is that Spacey's Buddy Ackerman character is really a much  nicer guy than he appears.  It is my belief after viewing this film so many  times that Buddy actually does care for Guy.  You can see it in the little  grins that he gives after he has reamed Guy out for something, and in the  way that all of his advice is based on his own personal experience.  I  don't think that Buddy is lying when he tells Guy that after a year with  him, Guy will be ready for anything.  He is deliberately cruel in a very  educational way.  I believe that he is trying to get Guy to accept the  realism of the terrible, unfair Hollywood system, and that he really does  mean for Guy to follow in his footsteps, but is being intentionally brutal  in an attempt to quickly teach Guy the lessons that it took Buddy himself  10 years to learn.  I also think the ending is one of the most effective  twists I have ever seen on film, and proves my point that Buddy actually  does care about Guy and wants him to succeed.This movie is a must  see for anyone who is interested in the Hollywood studio system and wants  to see a viciously funny black comedy.

His performance as Buddy Ackerman - heartless Hollywood powerbroker behind ""ball-shaking"" action blockbusters - will have you cringing and crying with laughter at the same time.  But it isn't all gags, or at least its gags have a higher purpose - and that's the real genius of this film.  Beneath the heinous abuse and delightful revenge, George Huang has delivered a tightly written commentary on how the ""career vs. creativity"" struggle can torture even the most well-intended innocent into a shape he would scarcely recognise.  And its satire on the politics of power doesn't only apply to Hollywood.  The manipulations and humiliations, at least in spirit, will be familiar to office workers everywhere.  This is a terrific movie, which perhaps suffered by being released almost simultaneously with Spacey's breakthrough films - ""Seven"" and ""The Usual Suspects"".  Had it been released a year or two later, I can't help thinking Spacey would have earned an Oscar for it and dragged George Huang's wonderful screenplay to the podium with him.

189830,A1NSHD4YCL5DV3,1573624047,"Vish Iyer ""wish_1979""","[2, 4]","The movie is very simple, with just three main characters, and has the least complicated of plots: it simply deals with a tormenting employer, and how his tormented employee avenges his tormentor; simple, isn't it? Yet, I am amazed as to how one can make such a masterpiece considering it has the most of the trite of plots. The reason to this is also simple: a bit of outr&eacute; `creativity' by the movie-director, and of course, Mr. Kevin Spacey.The movie wouldn't be half as good without Spacey, who is the life of the movie. Though he plays the part of the villain, he is more adorable than anyone else in the movie. The whole of the 90 min. of the movie is full of Spacey, and his mordant dialogues. Though one is supposed to feel sorry for Frank Whaley, for the inclement treatment he receives from Spacey, one doesn't. On the contrary, one rather wants that Spacey continue this treatment, so that he (Spacey) could continue treating the viewer with his fantabulous dialogue-delivery of some of the most acerbic dialogues ever written. It is amazing that one actually ends up laughing throughout the major part of this otherwise subfusc movie, thanks to Spacey.Though Spacey has got a lot to do with making this movie, a treat to watch, the exceptional direction is also worth a mention. Though George Huang had nothing much to play with, as far as this movie is concerned, which mainly consists of exchange of dialogues, and very little of anything else, with some `intelligent' creativity from him, he has managed to make this a very interestingly directed movie. The interesting direction comes from the really weird arrangement of the movie, especially the non-chronological ordering of the scenes.The climax of the movie is unpredictable, and one of the best ever. The whole course of the movie changes drastically in the last five minutes. As a matter of fact, though the movie puts on a funny faade throughout, one actually feels quite sad after the movie ends, feeling sorry for Michelle Forbes, especially. This is where beauty lies in the movie: though it makes you laugh throughout, you actually feel `punched in the face', at the end.
