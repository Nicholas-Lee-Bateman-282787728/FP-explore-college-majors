1457174,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B005EWRJGM,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[0, 1]","One of my reasons to view foreign film is to be taken to a time and a place that introduces me to a new culture, a breathtaking landscape, imaginative characters, and of course a new experience.  This German film from 2010 offers great insight.If you are not familiar with Werner Herzog, an influential documentary filmmaker, think of the bizarre film with the dwarves.  I call it Little People Gone Wild.  But, the movie is titledEven Dwarfs Started Small.  There are some very well known Herzog films, includingFitzcarraldoorThe Enigma of Kaspar Hauser, the latter something I did not care for.But, this is different, as it is a look into the lives Russian trappers in Siberia, along the Tiaga River, living isolated lives trapping for their livelihood.  One cannot imagine the existence these trappers endure, the hard laborious work, the minus 50 below temperatures.  And, you hear a lot about their companions, the dogs.This film puts real meaning to ""living off the land"".  It is a community of about 300 villagers, who have no taxes, no government, their own values and traditions.  It is a remarkable look into the four seasons of this village and the hunters.The narration, done by Herzog, is in English, while subtitles are in white, often making it difficult to read against background of snow.  At times, the dialogue may go fast.Wonderful film, insightful, shocking, surprising.....Rizzo",5,"A new meaning to ""Living Off the Land""",1373846400,"07 15, 2013",2013,1400,"['One', 'reasons', 'view', 'foreign', 'film', 'be', 'taken', 'time', 'place', 'new', 'culture', 'breathtaking', 'landscape', 'imaginative', 'characters', 'course', 'new', 'experience', 'German', 'film', '2010', 'offers', 'great', 'insight.If', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'Werner', 'Herzog', 'influential', 'documentary', 'filmmaker', 'think', 'bizarre', 'film', 'dwarves', 'call', 'Little', 'People', 'Gone', 'Wild', 'movie', 'titledEven', 'Dwarfs', 'Started', 'Small', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'known', 'Herzog', 'films', 'includingFitzcarraldoorThe', 'Enigma', 'Kaspar', 'Hauser', 'latter', 'something', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'for.But', 'different', 'look', 'lives', 'Russian', 'trappers', 'Siberia', 'Tiaga', 'River', 'living', 'isolated', 'lives', 'trapping', 'livelihood', 'One', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'existence', 'trappers', 'endure', 'hard', 'laborious', 'work', 'minus', '50', 'temperatures', 'hear', 'lot', 'companions', 'dogs.This', 'film', 'real', 'meaning', 'living', 'off', 'land', 'community', '300', 'villagers', 'who', 'have', 'taxes', 'government', 'own', 'values', 'traditions', 'remarkable', 'look', 'four', 'seasons', 'village', 'hunters.The', 'narration', 'done', 'Herzog', 'English', 'subtitles', 'are', 'white', 'often', 'making', 'difficult', 'read', 'background', 'snow', 'times', 'dialogue', 'may', 'go', 'fast.Wonderful', 'film', 'insightful', 'shocking', 'surprising', '..Rizzo']",Happy People: A Year In The Taiga

This latest effort of his, following the life of these Siberian hunters and trappers for a year, is great (although the filming was by Russian Dmitry Vasyukov and not Herzog). And these people are incredibly resourceful, tough, and skilled (and hard working!). It's nice to just know people still have such knowledge and have to use it to survive! On the other hand much of the traditional (native) knowledge is disappearing - thanks to the ubiquitous vodka. Its possible to learn a lot from them too, even though mostly its just a glimpse into what life was like for most of us in a pre-industrial world.It's obvious Herzog really appreciates these independent and resourceful, mostly solitary men in camo and their loyal canine companions - no rules, no bureaucracy, no masters - in the wilds of a natural world.Such is a life of simple and well earned pleasures.",5,Wonderful and fascinating,1367539200,"05 3, 2013",2013,1072,"['Okay', 'now', 'favorite', 'Herzog', 'documentary', 'Herzog', 'known', 'somewhat', 'droll', 'narrating', 'uncomplicated', 'naturalistic', 'cinematography', 'always', 'really', 'get', 'unusual', 'subjects', 'latest', 'effort', 'following', 'life', 'Siberian', 'hunters', 'trappers', 'year', 'great', 'filming', 'was', 'Russian', 'Dmitry', 'Vasyukov', 'not', 'Herzog', 'people', 'are', 'incredibly', 'resourceful', 'tough', 'skilled', 'hard', 'working', 'nice', 'just', 'know', 'people', 'still', 'have', 'such', 'knowledge', 'have', 'use', 'survive', 'other', 'hand', 'much', 'traditional', 'native', 'knowledge', 'disappearing', 'thanks', 'ubiquitous', 'vodka', 'possible', 'learn', 'lot', 'too', 'even', 'mostly', 'just', 'glimpse', 'what', 'life', 'was', 'most', 'pre-industrial', 'world.It', 'obvious', 'Herzog', 'really', 'independent', 'resourceful', 'mostly', 'solitary', 'men', 'camo', 'loyal', 'canine', 'companions', 'rules', 'bureaucracy', 'masters', 'wilds', 'natural', 'world.Such', 'life', 'simple', 'well', 'earned', 'pleasures']",Happy People: A Year In The Taiga

Yet the men in this community who make their living by trapping [sables primarily] seem to think they have the best of all worlds, in that they are free to choose, work enough to survive and provide for their families, and then enjoy what appears as a cohesive community life with all the others in their small village of approximately 300 people total. The main character Gnady [spelling], a trapper exclaims at the beginning of his interview that no man can ever be considered a true trapper without his dog[s]. He has two hunting dogs at the time of filming, of some mixed lineage, but I would say looked mostly like what you would expect in this hard land - Siberian Huskies.  He praised all of them, including the ones who were now too old to hunt with him and whom he says will eat as well as the working dogs.  He also calls them his pensioners. Like all true dog lovers he brags about their various exploits and expresses how saddened he is by the fact that his best dogs died too young as both his favorite female and male companion were killed by the same bear, which he quickly dispatched but not before it had killed his two companions.Gnady is also very proud of his own self sufficiency in the forest, showing how he actually built a hut and and a pair of skis. They fell the trees for the hut and skis, with their most modern piece of equipment being a chain saw. But they make their own wooden wedges to split the giant trees into boards, which they cut shape and plane by hand into the final finished skis.As with all Werner Herzog films the photography is superb, with its desolate yet breathtaking beauty and the terrific underwater scenes showing the Russian Pike in their natural habitat. And credit should be given to Dmitry Vasyukov as co-producer and who was responsible for most of the scenes, but Herzog, as is typical, does all the narration in his distinctive gravelly voice, although you can distinctly hear Gnady telling him the story in Russian.A wonderful story of a tough existence, and yet as the title says a Happy Group of People.

1457189,A3485K2A3Q814Z,B005EWRJGM,Lemons,"[0, 0]","Once again, Werner Herzog is off the beaten track with this excellent 90-minute 2010 documentary.  In the heart of the Siberian Taiga (where temperatures plummet to minus 50C in winter), is the tightly-knit collective settlement of Bakhta, home to 300 souls. Accessible only by helicopter, or by boat in the brief mosquito infested summers, these hardy folk contentedly eke out a living in much the same way as their forebears have for hundreds of years, except for a few motorized devices, such as chain saws, outboard motors and snowmobiles.While the movie is credited to Herzog, who narrates in his sparse understated manner (in English), Russian co-producer Dimitry Vasyukov had shot most of the footage before Herzog became involved.The movie centers around a year in the life of a couple of trappers, who, despite their trade, mostly have a rigid and ethical moral code. They are disciplined, independent and resourceful - each season demanding special tasks and talents to ensure that the cycle continues - to support their families, dogs and the mutually dependent hamlet. As one trapper says : ""You can take away a man's health and wealth, but not his skill.""Despite finding any hint of animal cruelty abhorrent, the trappers trade did not offend me. They are not killing sable for sport. It is done as humanely as possible, in order to earn a living and provide sustenance. The same applies to fishing.The pivotal role that their dogs play, and the trappers' intuitive understanding of what constitutes a solid working dog, is fascinating. They have a strong bond with their well-trained dogs, who are their only companions during the bleak trapping season.Initially I found it disturbing that experienced trappers leave their dogs outside in rudimentary shelters and make them run alongside the sled without food or rest for 150 kilometers or more on the journeys home from their remote trapping huts. But on reflection, I realized that these are working dogs, not pampered house pets. Should a trapper be injured or fall ill, the dogs have to be fit enough and familiar with the terrain to return to the village alone to summon help.My only criticism comes from the one-dimensional aspect of this documentary. Apart from briefly showing how the indigenous people have had to resort to menial labour due to alcoholism, and an arbitrary visit from a politician soliciting votes for the upcoming election (about which there is a dry comment from Herzog that the voters couldn't care less) we gain little information on the lives of the rest of the community.How do the women and non-trappers occupy their time?

1457190,A3O2Y1MVIY77IE,B005EWRJGM,"Mary McGreevey ""frwhiskey""","[0, 0]","This film will mesmerize those folks who dream of escape from the modern world and its ratrace.  Plenty of Russians feel the same as Americans and Europeans, especially men, and so off they go to the great escape from government, bureaucracy, taxes and lack of space:  Siberia!  So it's minus 50 or 60 in winter - at least there's no one on your back!  At least, if you are a good, strong and healthy he-man with an ax, hand-made skis, a modern jetski, guns, weather gear, gasoline and a family (i.e. women and kids and cheap native Ket labor) back in the village of Bahkta to handle the rest of life.This was originally a film shot by a Russian filmmaker, Vasyukov, a wonderful four hours showing the seasons of life in the Yenesei river in Eastern Siberia.  Werner Herzog, a renowned GErman filmmaker, saw all four of the hours while visiting a friend in Los Angeles.  He decided to use 1.5 hours of the footage with his own classic, simple voiceover showing the life of the hard-working and self-reliant Russian hunters who spend all the &#34;warm&#34; months getting ready for their harsh and long rivers.  The men are each in charge of their own traps and territories, they go independently, each alone with his own indispensible dog, to hunt sable, mink, and any other furs to pay their bills.I myself loved the life of Finnish Lapland when I was there in the 1980's, so naturally I loved this film.  But would the average viewer looking for action and a plot?  No, this film is a meditative dream, so commonly found in German and Scandanavian men, that they can escape their crowded societies and be free, natural and completely independent men.  That they are not, well, never mind, let's not quibble about the details on how the men depend on the women, the government for their trapping and hunting rights, the boats and helicopters that bring tourists and supplies in summer, and the right to the land itself.Our main character, Anatoli Blume, was a 20-year-old in 1970, who applied to be a Siberian hunter and was dropped to survive on his own devices by plane.  The first year he almost died, but he learned and became by age 60, as we see him in his bearded and rather gnarly Tolystoyan quiet self, an accomplished and successful and HAPPY man.  So we are told.Each viewer can decide for himself if Anatoli, the Ket (natives), and his wife and children are happy.  There are some intimations that the failing, government-dependent Asiatic natives, sometimes called Ostyak, who do the cheap-income hard labor such as stacking wood for wages, are an alcoholic and miserable bunch.  Their lot under the Tsars and the Soviet anti-kulak movement is something anyone can read here online.  That they themselves admit that they could stop drinking, work hard and be happy, is an interesting admission as they grunt through the wood-loading.  In other words, it's up to each person, even in that godforsaken village of 300, to find happiness, just as it is in New York or Moscow or a small Kansas town.  What is also worth noting if you'd like to stop the film and see the Ket more closely:  these are the people most closely connected to the natives of the Pacific Northwest and Northern Californian natives, called Miwok.  The language analysts say that their language is a different one from the majority of the Siberian languages, closer in structure to Vietnamese, inflected to a high degree.There are only about 1600 of these people left and not all know their native tongue.Meanwhile, in this film, Anatoli was a young married man in 1970, but the first wife left after a year.  He stayed and remarried, to a woman who appears Eurasian, who is nameless, stoical and very quiet.  She accepts his long absences; we mainly see her as someone who waits for his arrivals, spends Christmas with him, or the celebration of the end of WWII (Stalin's victory over the Nazis), and of Anatoli's children we see only a blur.  I found this a little disconcerting; was it all chopped from the original four hours?Anatoli represents the man who can live on his own without help; without answering to higher authority.  But in the face of Siberian winter, alone in his handmade log huts in 20 hours of darkness and minus 60 temperatures, can he not occasionally feel fear?  I think what would be better in describing these hunters' lives:  quiet contentment and SISU, the Finnish quality of endurance and submission to harsh and difficult problems.  What may appear as SISU, however, can mask a deep unhappiness.That is where the heavy drinking of Russia, especially Siberia, comes in.  Anatoli and the others do not seem to be addicted, but they do have a glass of vodka to send them off for their long hunting alone in the winter months.You will see the fat pike of the Russian rivers, the making of a tar out of birch linings and fish oil to fight the ferocious mosquitoes, the making of a canoe by hand, the building of log hunter's huts, the stacking of food high above a bear's reach, the building of wooden traps and the laying of steel traps (individual hunters have their own methods and don't all agree), the hacking of trees which block a jetski's path, and the endless work of survival against snow, snow, snow.  The burden of snow on the roof of the houses - it is constantly building up and crash the roof down.The breakup of the ice on the river in spring is amazing to see.The dog's desperate hunting of a mink inside a fallen log, and his killing of it finally, is a great dramatic scene - if alarming, for those who don't like to thinking about the dog-eat-mink world out there, and the bear-eat-dog lifestyle as well.Dogs are held in great affection but are definitely the workhorses, kept on a strict discipline and diet.I can highly recommend this as a nature film, and I did like Werner Herzog's voice in GErman.  On the DVD you can hear the GErman and read the English translation underneath.  It is so typical GErman to dream of escape into the wilderness. I remember that int he Yukon, a month's trip in 1993, the place was full of Germans, Austrians, Swiss and Scandanavians, hunting, fishing, canoing, camping, cooking and eating and drinking by campfires.  It was the Marlboro Man's dream come true.Do women have a place in this?  Well, somewhere, yes, but not in the film - not much.  No romance for primitive hunting man!ENJOY all you wilderness dreamers!",5,"Siberian hunters and trappers, with each man an island?

A few years ago Herzog also was involved with this documentary as a co-director (and co-writer and co-producer).""Happy People: A Year in the Taiga"" (2010 release from Germany; 90 min.) brings us a close look at the lives of people in Bakhta, a small village in the Siberian Taiga. We learn there are about 300 people living there, and the documentary focuses on a couple of them, in particular several trappers. As the movie opens, we are in late April and Spring is arriving, a busy time for the locals. The Yenisei River is still completely frozen over at that point. We follow one of the trappers on his rounds in the woods, checking on various traps, and also on his huts. There is no particularly dramatic twist or discovery as you watch the movie unfold, simply the realization that this small community manages to be almost entirely self-sufficient (the only way to reach it is by helicpoter or by boat, when the river isn't frozen). There is one moment of complete absurdity in the movie, when out of nowehere a boat arrives in late summer, carrying a politician and his cheerleaders, vying for votes in an upcoming election. Notes Herzog dryly (as only he can): ""The locals couldn't care less!"".While the credits state that the movie is co-directed by Dmitry Vasyukov and Werner Herzog, the movie was actually shot by Vasyukov, and Herzog became involved after that. As a further comment, even though this movie is 2 1/2 years old, imagine my surprise when it showed up this past week, unannounced and without any pre-release buzz, at the art-house theatre here in Cincinnati. Better later than never, I suppose, although the screening I saw this at was not well attended.

1457195,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B005EWRJGM,Roland E. Zwick,"[10, 11]","***1/2""Happy People: A Year in the Taiga"" is the latest in a series of nature documentaries by Werner Herzog (here with co-direction by Dimitry Vasyokov), this one chronicling life in a Siberian village over a twelve-month period. Bakhta is located alongside the Yenisei River in the Taiga Forest, and the inhabitants there have been eking out an existence under some pretty challenging conditions for centuries now (this is Siberia, after all). We watch as they make preparations for trapping, build cabins in the wilderness, fashion out canoes from old tree trunks, fish in the river, fend off bears and mosquitoes, and store up supplies for the brutal winter to come. For this is life as it is lived in one of the most misbegotten outposts of civilization. As Herzog himself says, these people resemble early Man from a distant ice age. And, yet, as the title implies, the inhabitants of Bakhta are far from unhappy with their lot.This is reflected most in the many wise and canny observations about the value of hard work and the cyclical nature of life emanating from one of the town's most seasoned  citizens, a sort of rural philosopher who`s been trapping in that area ever since the Communist government dropped him off and left him to fend for himself more than forty years ago. It is his commentary, more than even Herzog's own voiceover narration, that draws the viewer into this strange and unfamiliar world, one that is striking in both its harshness and its stark beauty (the image of a massive river of thawing ice heading swiftly northward during the spring is not one that will be easily forgotten).This isn't Herzog's most innovative work by a long shot, but if anthropological studies are your preferred fare, this movie will surely fit the bill.However, a warning may be in order for the hypersensitive viewer: this is NOT a movie that comes with the proviso, ""No animals were harmed in the making of this film.""",3,Not prime Herzog but rewarding nonetheless,1373155200,"07 7, 2013",2013,1933,"['***1/2', 'Happy', 'People', 'Year', 'Taiga', 'latest', 'series', 'nature', 'documentaries', 'Werner', 'Herzog', 'here', 'co-direction', 'Dimitry', 'Vasyokov', 'one', 'chronicling', 'life', 'Siberian', 'village', 'twelve-month', 'period', 'Bakhta', 'located', 'Yenisei', 'River', 'Taiga', 'Forest', 'inhabitants', 'have', 'been', 'eking', 'out', 'existence', 'pretty', 'challenging', 'conditions', 'centuries', 'now', 'Siberia', 'watch', 'make', 'preparations', 'trapping', 'build', 'cabins', 'wilderness', 'fashion', 'out', 'canoes', 'old', 'tree', 'trunks', 'fish', 'river', 'fend', 'off', 'bears', 'mosquitoes', 'store', 'up', 'supplies', 'brutal', 'winter', 'come', 'life', 'lived', 'one', 'most', 'misbegotten', 'outposts', 'civilization', 'Herzog', 'people', 'resemble', 'early', 'Man', 'distant', 'ice', 'age', 'yet', 'title', 'implies', 'inhabitants', 'Bakhta', 'are', 'far', 'unhappy', 'lot.This', 'reflected', 'most', 'many', 'wise', 'canny', 'observations', 'value', 'hard', 'work', 'cyclical', 'nature', 'life', 'emanating', 'one', 'town', 'most', 'seasoned', 'citizens', 'sort', 'rural', 'philosopher', 'who', 's', 'been', 'trapping', 'area', 'ever', 'Communist', 'government', 'dropped', 'off', 'left', 'fend', 'more', 'forty', 'years', 'ago', 'commentary', 'more', 'even', 'Herzog', 'own', 'voiceover', 'narration', 'viewer', 'strange', 'unfamiliar', 'world', 'one', 'striking', 'harshness', 'stark', 'beauty', 'image', 'massive', 'river', 'thawing', 'ice', 'heading', 'swiftly', 'northward', 'spring', 'not', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'easily', 'forgotten', '.This', ""n't"", 'Herzog', 'most', 'innovative', 'work', 'long', 'shot', 'anthropological', 'studies', 'are', 'preferred', 'fare', 'movie', 'will', 'surely', 'fit', 'bill.However', 'warning', 'may', 'be', 'order', 'hypersensitive', 'viewer', 'NOT', 'movie', 'proviso', 'animals', 'were', 'harmed', 'making', 'film']",Happy People: A Year In The Taiga
