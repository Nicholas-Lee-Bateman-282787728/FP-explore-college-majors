The story has holes in it and the CGI effects makes it look cheap. For flicks like this it should be latex and nothing else. The reason I gave it a 1 is because its a good story and if handled right could have put a new spin on vamp movies. The first vampire  is from the middle east so that would have been something new but they just screwed it up tooo much. if you do see this rent it don't buy.",1,Not Even worth the 1!,1068336000,"11 9, 2003",2003,588,"['movie', 'just', 'terrible', 'first', 'main', 'character', 'Frost', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'director', 'are', 'suppose', 'take', 'serious', 'bad', 'ass', 'special', 'oops', 'solider', 'give', 'break', 'story', 'holes', 'CGI', 'effects', 'look', 'cheap', 'flicks', 'should', 'be', 'latex', 'nothing', 'else', 'reason', 'gave', '1', 'good', 'story', 'handled', 'right', 'could', 'have', 'put', 'new', 'spin', 'vamp', 'movies', 'first', 'vampire', 'middle', 'east', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'something', 'new', 'just', 'screwed', 'up', 'tooo', 'much', 'do', 'see', 'rent', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy']",Frost: Portrait of a Vampire

There's nothing like getting together with friends and poking fun at a goofy movie.Unless it is REALLY bad--so painfully bad you can't stand to watch it.&quot;Frost&quot; is of the latter variety... bad acting, boring dialog, lame plot, paltry and fake-looking CGI effects, and one halfway decent actor (Gary Busey).  If you really *LOVE* vampire movies, do NOT rent this film.  The basic vampire storyline is so tried and true that its hard to ruin, but Frost succeeds in ruining it royally.If you want a shlocky vampire film that's fun to watch, try &quot;Vampires&quot; with James Woods.",1,Utter Shlock,1068681600,"11 13, 2003",2003,640,"['know', 'tend', 'actually', '*enjoy*', 'bad', 'movies', 'nothing', 'getting', 'together', 'friends', 'poking', 'fun', 'goofy', 'movie.Unless', 'REALLY', 'bad', 'so', 'painfully', 'bad', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'watch', 'it.', 'quot', 'Frost', 'quot', 'latter', 'variety', 'bad', 'acting', 'boring', 'dialog', 'lame', 'plot', 'paltry', 'fake-looking', 'CGI', 'effects', 'one', 'halfway', 'decent', 'actor', 'Gary', 'Busey', 'really', '*LOVE*', 'vampire', 'movies', 'do', 'NOT', 'rent', 'film', 'basic', 'vampire', 'storyline', 'so', 'tried', 'true', 'hard', 'ruin', 'Frost', 'ruining', 'want', 'shlocky', 'vampire', 'film', 'fun', 'watch', 'try', 'quot', 'Vampires', 'quot', 'James', 'Woods']",Frost: Portrait of a Vampire

Wouldn't it indicate that Frost was the vampire?  Not!  Next:  the movie hops around so much you don't really have any true concept of where we are in the script.  There was an attempt in originality to make the vampire an Afghanistanian (or is it Afghan?), because that means he can walk around in the daylight.  (Although later on, a big faux pas:  Nat, the vampire, tells Frost the vampire hunter that guns can't kill him.  BUT Nat himself shot the first vampire right in the head.)  Also another convenience:  you don't become a vampire until you die (that could be years later).  Problem: We never really know when Nat died.  ACTING:  Well, Charles Lister as Nat tries hard, but other than the schlocky red eyes and the blood syrup, he isn't given much to work with.  Why does he like being a vampire? He was a good Catholic boy at the start of the movie; he even chomps on a priest in the confessional later.  No explanation is given for that one, either.  Gary Busey (once nominated for an Oscar for ""Buddy Holly Story"" if you can believe that one) turns in another incredibly bad performance as the blind museum curator who spins the story for us.  But, lordy lordy, where did Jeff Manzanares come from?  The end credits said he was the stunt coordinator for the film, too.  But why was he given the lead role?  Now, let's focus on the word LEAD.  With a long e, it's ""lead"", with a short e, It's ""lead,"" like in the mineral.  And that's what this beefy jerk gives in the role of Jack Frost (really, we've had killer snowmen and Michael Keaton already take this name, why bother with it again).  The climax in the graveyard is downright silly, and the ending is so predictable, one can only sigh and say I told you so.So why 2 stars instead of one?  I don't know, guess I'm just in an unusually forgiving mood.  But, what could have been an interesting vampire variation, merely becomes another one of those movies you can find in the 5.50 bin at Walmart.

750926,A38AXXL7DMVFMQ,B00008ZZ63,"Vicente Drago ""Shaun O'Donnell""","[0, 0]","Frost portrait of a Vampire is a strange movie.  And with coverart like the one it's got most people will avoid it.  However there is some story to it so might as well explain.Frost starts off with a blind Gary Busey examining a crime scene.  Apparently he has heightened senses and can give a more accurate examiniation as to the cause of death.  From there he spins the tale of an old Friend named Frost who almost lost his sight in the Gulf War.  While there his best friend gets attacked by a vampire.  After the war they all go there seperate ways.  During that time period the friend gets killed and comes back as a Vampire.  From there he slowly trying to understand what he has become.The problem with this movie is that it feels to much like a made for TV movie and or like a book.  Each segment is seperated into chapters literally and the story is very confusing.  Unless one really pays attention to what is going on during the story they will get lost (I almost did and I was paying attention).  It's a decent movie but it's a little out there, a little artsy fartsy, and just overall bizzare.  If you don't pay attention you will get lost.",3,To confusing and out there to entertain the average joe,1055376000,"06 12, 2003",2003,1153,"['Frost', 'portrait', 'Vampire', 'strange', 'movie', 'coverart', 'one', 'got', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'avoid', 'However', 'story', 'so', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'explain.Frost', 'starts', 'off', 'blind', 'Gary', 'Busey', 'examining', 'crime', 'scene', 'Apparently', 'heightened', 'senses', 'can', 'give', 'more', 'accurate', 'examiniation', 'cause', 'death', 'tale', 'old', 'Friend', 'named', 'Frost', 'who', 'almost', 'lost', 'sight', 'Gulf', 'War', 'best', 'friend', 'attacked', 'vampire', 'war', 'go', 'there', 'seperate', 'ways', 'time', 'period', 'friend', 'killed', 'back', 'Vampire', 'slowly', 'trying', 'understand', 'what', 'become.The', 'problem', 'movie', 'much', 'made', 'TV', 'movie', 'like', 'book', 'segment', 'seperated', 'chapters', 'literally', 'story', 'very', 'confusing', 'one', 'really', 'attention', 'what', 'going', 'story', 'will', 'get', 'lost', 'almost', 'did', 'was', 'paying', 'attention', 'decent', 'movie', 'little', 'there', 'little', 'artsy', 'fartsy', 'just', 'overall', 'bizzare', 'do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'attention', 'will', 'get', 'lost']",Frost: Portrait of a Vampire
