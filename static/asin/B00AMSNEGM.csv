1613985,A3BACUOZV1M0WM,B00AMSNEGM,L. G. CHARLOT,"[1, 5]","This was one of the better BluRay purchases I have made. If you like Russell Crowe and Brad Pitt, and don't already have these films in your collection, this BluRay is definitely worth the purchase price. The video and audio are clean, high quality transfers, which you would expect since these are both relatively new films. WARNING: Both films employ extremely graphic violence and gore in the combat scenes, which are definitely not appropriate for kids, and some nudity (in Troy). I would call this a &#34;hard&#34; R rating, although considering the violence of a lot of the video games out there that pre-teen kids are playing, maybe it's a lost cause to try and protect them against extreme violence in movies.SPOILER WARNING: Skip the next paragraph if you don't want any clues at all about the films.Personally, I liked Gladiator best of the two films. Russel Crowe and the supporting cast give stellar performances, and even the &#34;villain&#34; in this film, Emperor Commodus, can be seen with some sympathy as a spoiled brat who never grew up, and by way of the patricide he committed, found himself way over his head in a job that he was incompetent to perform.  Troy is also a very good (if loosely based) film adaptation of Homer's Iliad. King Agammemnon of Mycenae is the &#34;villain&#34; in this film, and the actor did a great job of portraying him as a megalomaniac. Priam and his older son Hector are the &#34;good guys&#34;, but that leaves Achillies, played by Brad Pitt, in a grey area somewhere in the middle - probably intentionally - and his overall attitude is so depressing and negative through most of the film that it's hard to &#34;like&#34; him at all, at least until the last half hour of the film. Okay, no more spoilers.SUMMARY: A double feature film, with excellent storytelling by the cast and director. Both films are extremely violent in the combat scenes, with (in my opinion) too much explicit blood and graphic swordplay.  The story could have been told just as well with the gore toned down somewhat. RECOMMENDED for adults only, these movies are rated &#34;R&#34; and they mean it.",5,A bargain price for a double feature BluRay.
