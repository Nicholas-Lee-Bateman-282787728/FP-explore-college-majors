1041724,A14N5L5T089VX3,B000LXHK22,"Allen Vander Meulen ""Omnivorous reader""","[5, 5]","Admittedly, Russell Crowe is not known for his work in Romantic Comedies, which is why this film sank out of sight so quickly in the Theatres.  That it did so poorly in general release is a shame, as it is quite a good film - fun to watch, humorous, excellent performances, and a sweet ending.Most of the actors, aside from Crowe and Albert Finney, are French, and you'll hear a fair amount of dialog in French (usually with subtitles) from their characters: particularly wisecracks and mild sexual humor.The movie centers, naturally, on Crowe's character - Max - a cynical, aggressive and downright nasty Bond Trader on the London exchange who's only interests in life are booze, money and women - though not necessarily in that order.  Early in the film Max learns that his Uncle Henry (played by Albert Finney) has died and left his entire estate to Max - a Chateau and winery in France.Max, partly because of a furor caused by his recent manipulation of the bond market, and partly to get his hands on more cash, decides this would be a convenient time to travel to France and liquidate the old place as quickly as possible.  --- Of course, things don't work out quite as he planned!Through flashbacks with Uncle Henry and Max (as a young boy), we learn that the relationship between them was very close - and that Henry was not fooled by Max's frequent attempts to hoodwink him.  We get the impression that the Uncle is trying to teach his nephew some important life lessons, and that the estate and winery have great significance and value beyond merely being an asset that can be sold.  We also see that Max really loved his Uncle, and has fond memories of the good times he had there as a child - Henry was his only family.As the story evolves, Max begins to regret how he allowed his hedonistic lifestyle and pursuit of wealth to isolate him from his Uncle, whom he had not seen in years.  The trip back to France awakens memories as he meets those who knew and loved his Uncle, and are working (sometimes behind Max's back) to preserve Henry's legacy.Of course there is a love interest, in the form of Marion Cotillard as ""Fanny"" - in her first English language film; as well as a possible daughter of Henry's that shows up unexpectedly, played by the Australian actress Abbie Cornish.  Both are excellent actresses, and I'm sure we'll see excellent performances from them in future films.I also hope that the lack of box office success for this film does not discourage Crowe from trying again.  It's a good film, and I'm convinced he'll eventually do at least as well, if not better, then Harrison Ford has done in very similar films, such as another favorite of mine -Sabrina.""A Good Year"" is not award winning material, nor does it pretend to be anything other than a sweet little romantic comedy.  As such, it works more as a comedy than as a romance - there is lots of physical and sight humor in the film, all in the beautiful setting of the Chateau and its surroundings.All in all, I found this film to be a more or less average effort in terms of the plot and writing, but above average for the entertainment value, beautiful photography, and solid performances.  So, in terms of overall value, I'll put it down for four stars: a good choice to rent or buy and see with your significant other some quiet and romantic evening - and be sure to not forget to bring along a good bottle of french wine!",4,A nice little film that doesn't take itself too seriously,1196208000,"11 28, 2007",2007,3416,"['Admittedly', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'not', 'known', 'work', 'Romantic', 'Comedies', 'why', 'film', 'sank', 'sight', 'so', 'quickly', 'Theatres', 'did', 'so', 'poorly', 'general', 'release', 'shame', 'quite', 'good', 'film', 'fun', 'watch', 'humorous', 'excellent', 'performances', 'sweet', 'ending.Most', 'actors', 'aside', 'Crowe', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'are', 'French', ""'ll"", 'hear', 'fair', 'amount', 'dialog', 'French', 'usually', 'subtitles', 'characters', 'particularly', 'wisecracks', 'mild', 'sexual', 'humor.The', 'movie', 'centers', 'naturally', 'Crowe', 'character', 'Max', 'cynical', 'aggressive', 'downright', 'nasty', 'Bond', 'Trader', 'London', 'exchange', 'who', 'only', 'interests', 'life', 'are', 'booze', 'money', 'women', 'not', 'necessarily', 'order', 'Early', 'film', 'Max', 'Uncle', 'Henry', 'played', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'died', 'left', 'entire', 'estate', 'Max', 'Chateau', 'winery', 'France.Max', 'partly', 'furor', 'caused', 'recent', 'manipulation', 'bond', 'market', 'partly', 'get', 'hands', 'more', 'cash', 'would', 'be', 'convenient', 'time', 'travel', 'France', 'liquidate', 'old', 'place', 'as', 'quickly', 'possible', 'course', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'quite', 'planned', 'flashbacks', 'Uncle', 'Henry', 'Max', 'young', 'boy', 'learn', 'relationship', 'was', 'very', 'close', 'Henry', 'was', 'not', 'fooled', 'Max', 'frequent', 'attempts', 'hoodwink', 'get', 'impression', 'Uncle', 'trying', 'teach', 'nephew', 'important', 'life', 'lessons', 'estate', 'winery', 'have', 'great', 'significance', 'value', 'merely', 'being', 'asset', 'can', 'be', 'sold', 'also', 'see', 'Max', 'really', 'loved', 'Uncle', 'fond', 'memories', 'good', 'times', 'had', 'there', 'child', 'Henry', 'was', 'only', 'family.As', 'story', 'evolves', 'Max', 'regret', 'how', 'allowed', 'hedonistic', 'lifestyle', 'pursuit', 'wealth', 'isolate', 'Uncle', 'whom', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'years', 'trip', 'back', 'France', 'memories', 'who', 'knew', 'loved', 'Uncle', 'are', 'working', 'sometimes', 'Max', 'back', 'preserve', 'Henry', 'legacy.Of', 'course', 'love', 'interest', 'form', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'Fanny', 'first', 'English', 'language', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'possible', 'daughter', 'Henry', 'up', 'unexpectedly', 'played', 'Australian', 'actress', 'Abbie', 'Cornish', 'are', 'excellent', 'actresses', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'see', 'excellent', 'performances', 'future', 'films.I', 'also', 'hope', 'lack', 'box', 'office', 'success', 'film', 'not', 'discourage', 'Crowe', 'trying', 'again', 'good', 'film', ""'m"", 'convinced', ""'ll"", 'eventually', 'do', 'least', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'better', 'then', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'done', 'very', 'similar', 'films', 'such', 'favorite', 'mine', '-Sabrina', 'Good', 'Year', 'not', 'award', 'winning', 'material', 'pretend', 'be', 'anything', 'other', 'sweet', 'little', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'such', 'more', 'comedy', 'romance', 'lots', 'physical', 'sight', 'humor', 'film', 'beautiful', 'setting', 'Chateau', 'surroundings.All', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'more', 'less', 'average', 'effort', 'terms', 'plot', 'writing', 'above', 'average', 'entertainment', 'value', 'beautiful', 'photography', 'solid', 'performances', 'So', 'terms', 'overall', 'value', ""'ll"", 'put', 'down', 'four', 'stars', 'good', 'choice', 'rent', 'buy', 'see', 'significant', 'other', 'quiet', 'romantic', 'evening', 'be', 'sure', 'not', 'forget', 'bring', 'along', 'good', 'bottle', 'french', 'wine']",N/A

1041726,AJYILFULOQ3CX,B000LXHK22,a man from the east coast,"[9, 9]","WARNING:  THIS REVIEW CONTAINS PLOT SPOILERS.  STOP READING RIGHT NOW IF YOU HAVEN'T YET SEEN THIS FILM AND WANT TO DO SO WITHOUT EXPECTATIONS.Ok, you've been warned.  If you're still reading ...Firstly, I'll agree with many of the other reviewers that there are no real surprises in this film.  It is a bit predictable ...And SO WHAT IF IT IS???Whilst the scenery is so beautiful (and captured so perfectly that it comes to play its own character, albeit not a major one, in this gem of a film) that it is almost distractingly so, there is a story here that, although nothing new, still very much bears telling.Why?Because this story, simple as it appears, never gets old, as long as it is told exceptionally well.  It is a story of deep meaning, one that is relevant to many.Simply put, this is a story about a man who ""finds himself"", to utilize that tired cliche.  Yet most cliches do have more than just a grain of truth to them, and this film is no exception.  Max Skinner, a bonds trader in England, is exceptionally good at his job, quite wealthy, a leader in his field ... in short, quite Alpha.Yet when his beloved Uncle Henri dies, leaving (or so it seems) to Max a breath-takingly beautiful vineyard in the south of France, Max must journey to this place where he spent his summers.  Max returns to the place where, with his uncle's tutelage, he gained his first insight into what it is to be a successful man.As the story goes on, Max must come to know Christie Roberts (Abbie Cornish playing a role that proves to be a lovely addition to this film), a young lady claiming to be his Uncle's illegitimate daughter.  He also re-connects with the DuFlot's, caretakers of the vineyard and villa, and also his close childhood friends.  Most importantly, he encounters Fanni, a girl he does not remember from his childhood, but who clearly remembers him ... or, at least, the person he used to be.What is so striking about this admittedly-cliched ""successful businessman who finds himself"" story is that Max discovers a part of himself he forgot without rejecting the man he has become.  In the end, what's most remarkable is that this person that Max was as a child becomes quite integrated with who Max now is as a man.  He doesn't regret his success in business, nor does he become Mr. Touchy-Feely, but there is much sincerity and wisdom in Max as he realizes where his heart and soul truly lie.At the film's close, we're left in the knowledge that Max is: #1, in love with a truly beautiful woman of great emotional depth (can't do without that), fiesty disposition (always a delicious treat, most especially if you happen to be an alpha male) and true kindness (again, can't do without this either); #2, reconnecting to his departed Uncle through continuing the operation of the vineyard in tandem with his cousin Christie (whom he has now accepted as being truthful in her claim of being Henri's daughter); and #3, content to move forward into the future in a greater understanding that it is a man's roots, and also the family that he creates in his life, that define his identity, just as much as do his successes in business, science, art, law, and the like.Granted, perhaps at least a bit of the above is my interpretation, but what of it?  Excellent films deserve various interpretations, and now, you've heard mine.  If you haven't seen this film yet, please do so, as you are in for a real treat.  If you have seen this film, then perhaps you'll be inclined to agree with my interpretation.  (If you don't agree, please understand in advance that you have no chance whatsoever of disuading me from my position; I'm impossible once I've got my mind made up.)In sum total, I could very much relate to Max, and that's why I enjoy this film so much, the oh-so-very-lovely women, gorgeous scenery, and fine wine and French villa notwithstanding.Enjoy!!",4,a chick-flick for a man's man (if one can imagine such a thing),1259539200,"11 30, 2009",2009,3868,"['WARNING', 'THIS', 'REVIEW', 'CONTAINS', 'PLOT', 'SPOILERS', 'STOP', 'READING', 'RIGHT', 'NOW', 'IF', 'YOU', 'HAVE', ""N'T"", 'YET', 'SEEN', 'THIS', 'FILM', 'AND', 'WANT', 'TO', 'DO', 'SO', 'WITHOUT', 'EXPECTATIONS.Ok', ""'ve"", 'been', 'warned', ""'re"", 'still', 'reading', 'Firstly', ""'ll"", 'agree', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'are', 'real', 'surprises', 'film', 'bit', 'predictable', 'SO', 'WHAT', 'IF', 'IT', 'IS', 'scenery', 'so', 'beautiful', 'captured', 'so', 'perfectly', 'play', 'own', 'character', 'not', 'major', 'one', 'gem', 'film', 'almost', 'distractingly', 'so', 'story', 'here', 'that', 'nothing', 'new', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'bears', 'telling.Why', 'story', 'simple', 'never', 'old', 'as', 'long', 'told', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'story', 'deep', 'meaning', 'one', 'relevant', 'many.Simply', 'put', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'utilize', 'tired', 'cliche', 'most', 'cliches', 'do', 'have', 'more', 'just', 'grain', 'truth', 'film', 'exception', 'Max', 'Skinner', 'bonds', 'trader', 'England', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'job', 'quite', 'wealthy', 'leader', 'field', 'short', 'quite', 'Alpha.Yet', 'when', 'beloved', 'Uncle', 'Henri', 'leaving', 'so', 'Max', 'breath-takingly', 'beautiful', 'vineyard', 'south', 'France', 'Max', 'must', 'journey', 'place', 'where', 'spent', 'summers', 'Max', 'place', 'where', 'uncle', 'tutelage', 'gained', 'first', 'insight', 'what', 'be', 'successful', 'man.As', 'story', 'Max', 'must', 'come', 'know', 'Christie', 'Roberts', 'Abbie', 'Cornish', 'playing', 'role', 'be', 'lovely', 'addition', 'film', 'young', 'lady', 'claiming', 'be', 'Uncle', 'illegitimate', 'daughter', 'also', 'DuFlot', 'caretakers', 'vineyard', 'villa', 'also', 'close', 'childhood', 'friends', 'Most', 'importantly', 'Fanni', 'girl', 'not', 'remember', 'childhood', 'who', 'clearly', 'least', 'person', 'used', 'so', 'striking', 'admittedly-cliched', 'successful', 'businessman', 'who', 'story', 'Max', 'part', 'forgot', 'rejecting', 'man', 'become', 'end', 'what', 'most', 'remarkable', 'person', 'Max', 'was', 'child', 'quite', 'integrated', 'who', 'Max', 'now', 'man', ""n't"", 'regret', 'success', 'business', 'become', 'Mr.', 'Touchy-Feely', 'much', 'sincerity', 'wisdom', 'Max', 'where', 'heart', 'soul', 'truly', 'film', 'close', ""'re"", 'left', 'knowledge', 'Max', '1', 'love', 'truly', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'great', 'emotional', 'depth', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'fiesty', 'disposition', 'always', 'delicious', 'treat', 'most', 'especially', 'happen', 'be', 'alpha', 'male', 'true', 'kindness', 'again', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'either', '2', 'reconnecting', 'departed', 'Uncle', 'continuing', 'operation', 'vineyard', 'tandem', 'cousin', 'Christie', 'whom', 'now', 'accepted', 'being', 'truthful', 'claim', 'being', 'Henri', 'daughter', '3', 'content', 'move', 'forward', 'future', 'greater', 'understanding', 'man', 'roots', 'also', 'family', 'life', 'identity', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'successes', 'business', 'science', 'art', 'law', 'like.Granted', 'perhaps', 'least', 'bit', 'above', 'interpretation', 'what', 'Excellent', 'films', 'deserve', 'various', 'interpretations', 'now', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'mine', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'yet', 'please', 'do', 'so', 'are', 'real', 'treat', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'then', 'perhaps', ""'ll"", 'be', 'inclined', 'agree', 'interpretation', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'please', 'understand', 'advance', 'have', 'chance', 'whatsoever', 'disuading', 'position', ""'m"", 'impossible', 'once', ""'ve"", 'got', 'mind', 'made', 'up', 'sum', 'total', 'could', 'very', 'much', 'relate', 'Max', 'why', 'enjoy', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'oh-so-very-lovely', 'women', 'gorgeous', 'scenery', 'fine', 'wine', 'French', 'villa', 'notwithstanding.Enjoy']",N/A
1041727,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000LXHK22,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","The critic's may have panned it but there is much to enjoy wrapped tightly within this film.  There's warmth and humor as well as beautiful chemistry and scenery.  Crowe, while not delivering a Maximus-sized performance still delivers a charming and appealing performance.  In fact it's that charm and dedication that makes this film more than just fluff.  Crowe is one of if not our finest working actor, and his dedication to his roles make it undeniable to realize.  Even when playing a character that could come across generic and stock he breathes new life into a tired character and delivers to the audience.  And don't forget the amazing chemistry with co-star Marion Cotillard who is just amazingly beautiful and so charismatically elegant that one can't help but understand the mutual attraction despite Crowe's characters apparent arrogance.The film differs quite a bit from the novel of the same name as some have made mention.  Just a little inside information, Ridley Scott and Peter Mayle are friends.  The original concept for the novel was Scott's and it follows this film perfectly.  Upon writing the novel Mayle changed the entire concept.  So, Scott isn't destroying Mayle's creation, he's merely staying true to his original idea.  I personally prefer the film version over the novel, but that's my humble opinion.That said, the film follows Max Skinner, a stuck up British stock broker who learns of his dear Uncle Henry's death and of his sizable inheritance.  Max immediately decides to sell his Uncles villa in France but has to travel there to make the arrangements.  Standing in his way is a young beautiful American claiming to be Henry's illegitimate child.  If this proves to be true then the villa in turn would belong to her and Max could not sell.  The film follows Max as he grows as a man, realizing his stubborn and selfish ways and finds what truly makes him happy.  It's a very familiar story with really nothing new to the bag of tricks.  It plays out like many movies before it.  Max eventually changes and everything is right in the world.  He gets the beautiful French girl played by the beautifully amazing Cotillard and he finally lives for himself and not for his job.What makes the movie worth the price of admission is the scenery, the chemistry and the natural delivery.  The script may be plain but the way Crowe delivers his lines is brilliant.  He's amazing to watch.  The scenery, that beautiful French countryside, is a character all its own and is matched only by the beauty of its stars (Crowe and Cotillard make for a delicious couple).  The entire cast, from the stars to the supporting players like Abbie Cornish and Freddie Highmore (who plays Max in flashbacks), are all fantastic and natural.  Albert Finney is brilliant as usual and plays Uncle Henry with so much enthusiasm and charm that you fall in love with him instantly.  I personally LOVED Archie Panjabi who plays Max's assistant Gemma.  She has some of the best lines in the film and is so naturally sarcastic and witty; she's like the British Wanda Sykes.The film succeeds in putting a smile on your face.  That's all it really needs to do.  Is it perfect Oscar bait, no.  Is it a really good time, yes.  It's a film that shouldn't be judged to harshly.  It's nice for actors as brilliant as Crowe to do a film that's all about the audience and not all about the awards.  It shows that even when he's not gunning for the Oscar he still puts in a decent performance that connects with the audience.  He does that here.  Comedy is a hard thing to pull off, but `A Good Year' turns out to be a good laugh and a warm smile.",3,Offers a good time if you're willing to look at it for what it is...,1185321600,"07 25, 2007",2007,3640,"['critic', 'may', 'have', 'panned', 'much', 'enjoy', 'wrapped', 'tightly', 'film', 'warmth', 'humor', 'as', 'well', 'beautiful', 'chemistry', 'scenery', 'Crowe', 'not', 'delivering', 'Maximus-sized', 'performance', 'still', 'charming', 'appealing', 'performance', 'fact', 'charm', 'dedication', 'film', 'more', 'just', 'fluff', 'Crowe', 'one', 'not', 'finest', 'working', 'actor', 'dedication', 'roles', 'make', 'undeniable', 'realize', 'Even', 'when', 'playing', 'character', 'could', 'come', 'generic', 'stock', 'new', 'life', 'tired', 'character', 'delivers', 'audience', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'amazing', 'chemistry', 'co-star', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'who', 'just', 'amazingly', 'beautiful', 'so', 'charismatically', 'elegant', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'understand', 'mutual', 'attraction', 'Crowe', 'characters', 'apparent', 'arrogance.The', 'film', 'differs', 'quite', 'bit', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'have', 'made', 'mention', 'Just', 'little', 'inside', 'information', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'Peter', 'Mayle', 'are', 'friends', 'original', 'concept', 'novel', 'was', 'Scott', 'film', 'perfectly', 'writing', 'novel', 'Mayle', 'changed', 'entire', 'concept', 'So', 'Scott', ""n't"", 'destroying', 'Mayle', 'creation', 'merely', 'staying', 'true', 'original', 'idea', 'personally', 'prefer', 'film', 'version', 'novel', 'humble', 'opinion.That', 'said', 'film', 'Max', 'Skinner', 'stuck', 'up', 'British', 'stock', 'broker', 'who', 'dear', 'Uncle', 'Henry', 'death', 'sizable', 'inheritance', 'Max', 'immediately', 'sell', 'Uncles', 'villa', 'France', 'travel', 'there', 'make', 'arrangements', 'Standing', 'way', 'young', 'beautiful', 'American', 'claiming', 'be', 'Henry', 'illegitimate', 'child', 'be', 'true', 'then', 'villa', 'turn', 'would', 'belong', 'Max', 'could', 'not', 'sell', 'film', 'Max', 'man', 'realizing', 'stubborn', 'selfish', 'ways', 'what', 'truly', 'happy', 'very', 'familiar', 'story', 'really', 'nothing', 'new', 'bag', 'tricks', 'out', 'many', 'movies', 'Max', 'eventually', 'changes', 'everything', 'right', 'world', 'beautiful', 'French', 'girl', 'played', 'beautifully', 'amazing', 'Cotillard', 'finally', 'not', 'job.What', 'movie', 'price', 'admission', 'scenery', 'chemistry', 'natural', 'delivery', 'script', 'may', 'be', 'plain', 'way', 'Crowe', 'lines', 'brilliant', 'amazing', 'watch', 'scenery', 'French', 'countryside', 'character', 'own', 'matched', 'only', 'beauty', 'stars', 'Crowe', 'Cotillard', 'make', 'delicious', 'couple', 'entire', 'cast', 'stars', 'supporting', 'players', 'Abbie', 'Cornish', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'who', 'Max', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'fantastic', 'natural', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'brilliant', 'usual', 'Uncle', 'Henry', 'so', 'much', 'enthusiasm', 'charm', 'fall', 'love', 'instantly', 'personally', 'LOVED', 'Archie', 'Panjabi', 'who', 'Max', 'assistant', 'Gemma', 'best', 'lines', 'film', 'so', 'naturally', 'sarcastic', 'witty', 'British', 'Wanda', 'Sykes.The', 'film', 'putting', 'smile', 'face', 'really', 'do', 'Is', 'perfect', 'Oscar', 'bait', 'really', 'good', 'time', 'yes', 'film', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'judged', 'harshly', 'nice', 'actors', 'as', 'brilliant', 'Crowe', 'do', 'film', 'audience', 'not', 'awards', 'even', 'when', 'not', 'gunning', 'Oscar', 'still', 'decent', 'performance', 'audience', 'here', 'Comedy', 'hard', 'thing', 'pull', 'off', 'Good', 'Year', 'out', 'be', 'good', 'laugh', 'warm', 'smile']",N/A

Under investigation for a more-than-a-little-shady stock transaction, the trip to France gives the broker a chance to let things simmer down, while he unloads the property...but childhood memories, old friends, the arrival of an unknown, illegitimate heir, from America (Abbie Cornish), and a feisty, beautiful local French girl (Marion Cotillard) all conspire to force Crowe to rethink his priorities, as he falls under the spell of Provence.While the film offers few real surprises, the characters are all likable, the dialog is crisp and witty, and there is a tangible magic in the glorious French landscape.All-in-all, ""A Good Year"" makes a GREAT date movie, and may have you booking a trip to France!",4,"Gentle Humor, the beauty of Provence, and Russell Crowe!",1173744000,"03 13, 2007",2007,1627,"['change-of-pace', 'heavy', 'dramatics', 'CGI-heavy', 'spectacle', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'director', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'offered', 'up', 'Gladiator', 'warmly', 'romantic', 'Good', 'Year', 'charm', 'humor', 'should', 'make', 'film', 'favorite', 'fans', 'good', 'love', 'story', 'beauty', 'Provence', 'years', 'come', 'Based', 'Peter', 'Mayle', '2006', 'novel', 'turn', 'was', 'loosely', 'based', '1993', 'work', 'Year', 'Provence', 'film', 'reminiscent', 'Diane', 'Lane', '1993', 'comedy/drama', 'Tuscan', 'Sun', 'also', 'mind', '1961', 'Rock', 'Hudson/Gina', 'Lollobrigida', 'comedy', 'Come', 'September', 'three', 'films', 'offer', 'romance', 'glowing', 'Mediterranean', 'atmosphere', 'characters', 'as', 'unconventional', 'are', 'endearing.Crowe', 'high-power', 'unscrupulous', 'wickedly', 'funny', 'British', 'investment', 'broker', 'who', 'French', 'estate', 'vineyards', 'late', 'uncle', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'who', 'endearing', 'codger', 'flashbacks', 'investigation', 'more-than-a-little-shady', 'stock', 'transaction', 'trip', 'France', 'broker', 'chance', 'let', 'things', 'simmer', 'down', 'property', 'childhood', 'memories', 'old', 'friends', 'arrival', 'unknown', 'illegitimate', 'heir', 'America', 'Abbie', 'Cornish', 'feisty', 'beautiful', 'local', 'French', 'girl', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'conspire', 'force', 'Crowe', 'rethink', 'priorities', 'spell', 'Provence.While', 'film', 'offers', 'few', 'real', 'surprises', 'characters', 'are', 'likable', 'dialog', 'crisp', 'witty', 'tangible', 'magic', 'glorious', 'French', 'landscape.All-in-all', 'Good', 'Year', 'GREAT', 'date', 'movie', 'may', 'have', 'booking', 'trip', 'France']",N/A

1041741,AZVEPWRYOFBX5,B000LXHK22,Charity Bishop,"[0, 1]","After the separation of his parents, as a child Max Skinner (Freddie Highmore) would spend the summers every year with his Uncle Henry (Albert Finney) at his French vineyard. There, Max learned to appreciate the finer things in life... the beauty surrounding him, the taste of a good wine, the luxury of a good book. But those summers are long gone, since Max (Crowe) is now one of the most formidable, fiercest stock tradesmen in the European market. His very existence makes his competitors (Richard Coyle) mad with envy, since he can dump, trade, and spike stocks with his morning toast. Distant, have become his memories of carefree summers and spring vacations. The word isn't even in his vocabulary now, since everyone knows that a vacation is the perfect time for someone else to steal your job. Rather self-centered and cynical, Max is only mildly impacted when he receives news that Henry has passed away.Without a proper will, his nearest living relative is free to claim the estate, so Max reluctantly hops on a plane. His French is rusty, his driving skills impaired, and his interest in the vineyard minimal, since it produces only rubbish by the way of wine and seems to be falling apart around his ears. But the longer he stays there, making arrangements to sell long-distance with his attorney (Tom Hollander), the more he remembers his Uncle Henry and the wonderful times they had together. His life becomes infinitely more complicated and interesting when a beautiful woman in the village (Marion Cotillard) holds a grudge against him for inadvertently running her off the road, and an American girl (Abbie Cornish) shows up claiming to be Henry's illegitimate daughter. The result is a sweet romantic comedy that falls a little flat in its believability.One of the things I loved about the screenplay is that it truly had a unique premise, in addition to being brilliantly filmed. The flashbacks are so unexpected and touching that they are rather like remembering something yourself rather than being pulled into someone else's life. Everything about the film is beautiful, from the golden tint of childhood experiences to the lush colors that contrast with the old stucco house. The message is one that has been told before, but never with quite as much charm. I loved that in the first half, Max was permanently attached to his blackberry and as time passed, it rang less and less often as he became interested in the world around him. Falling into an empty pool and being unable to get out was also funny, particularly when his rescuer thinks it would be more fun to turn on the water than find a ladder. There were also a lot of unexpected, familiar actors that brought a smile to my face.Unfortunately, one thing kind of ruined it for me... that the filmmakers expect us to believe that after one date and impromptu sex, Fanny and Max love one another. I was disappointed that their relationship was not pure, because it would have given them a lot more chemistry not to go all out so soon. It is my most prominent gripe with the film, but it also has quite a lot of language (mostly s**t, but at least one muffled f-word, a couple abuses of God's name, and lots of references to English slang such as ""shag""). The French housekeeper smacks Max on the bum a couple of times. Conversation revolves around whether or not it would be improper for Max to become sexually involved with his cousin (he doesn't). The scene with Fanny and Max involves undressing, and passionate kissing. There is some immodesty among the women, including a glimpse of a woman's thigh (she's showing off a bruise) and a brief view at a woman's naked backside as she lays on a bed (she asks someone to look at her sunburn).One thing that might bother many audiences is the amount of drinking in the film. If there's a glass around, it has wine in it. More troubling is Max at age eleven becoming a connoisseur of films. Henry serves him alcohol on more than one occasion. Despite its faults, I was entertained and even touched by it, but it would have been much better without all the sly innuendos and the pointless love scene.

1041742,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000LXHK22,Chris Pandolfi,"[10, 11]","Max Skinner (Russell Crowe) has no time for leisure. He's a cold, calculating businessman, ready to make yet another fortune as the head trader for a London-based stock exchange. For him, it's never about commitment, loyalty, or trust; it's all about gaining the upper hand and coming out on top (financially speaking, of course). If that involves ruining a few careers, then so be it. How can someone of such little humility handle the rediscovery of his past, especially if it was a happy one? This is the premise behind Ridely Scott's ""A Good Year,"" a sweet and surprisingly witty film that makes an emotional statement without getting heavy on sentimentality. It's a story of both hidden and personal truths, none seeming attainable, all having funny ways of making themselves known.What I enjoyed most about this movie was Russell Crowe's performance, a near perfect combination of hard-nosed ambition, arrogance, and humor. He gives Skinner a charm that's undeniable, pretty much to the point of making the audience forget how unlikable a character he is. How interesting for a man of such low standards. Only someone dependent on financial success could unflatteringly refer to his coworkers as lab rats. Only a career-oriented workaholic would give his date the boot by telling her he's engaged. Only a competitive moneymaker would take a death in the family as seriously as he takes his freewheeling love life. This is Max Skinner in a nutshell: completely focused on success without giving any thought to a personal life.The death that he initially refuses to take seriously is that of his uncle, Henry (seen in flashback and played by Albert Finney). For Skinner, it's merely another opportunity to make money; Henry lived most of his life in a Provence chateau, complete with a sprawling vineyard and a well-stocked cellar of homemade wine (one of which tastes awful, the other of which is exceptionally rare). Skinner has inherited everything, not only because Henry hadn't updated his will in over twenty years, but because Henry believed that his nephew was his only living blood relative, as well (what happened to the rest of the family--most notably Skinner's parents--is never explicitly stated). Skinner fails to see the sentimental value of the estate; his only goal is to sell it as quickly as possible. That way, he can get on with his life.What he seems to be forgetting is that he grew up on that vineyard. Interwoven throughout the film are Skinner's flashback sequences, all of which show him as an active and happy--if a little headstrong--child (played by Freddie Highmore). Here enters a much needed dose of emotional depth and complexity; Henry clearly had a special relationship with his nephew, one that was not defined by hugs and kisses so much as it was defined by words of wisdom. The life lessons didn't cease even when they play a game of tennis; one particular scene shows how badly young Max reacted to losing. He slams his racket on the net. He pounds his feet in frustration. He yells immaturely. Henry calmly tells him that one must be just as graceful with his losses as he is with his victories. It's a good piece of advice, but the audience already knows that Max will remain bitter.The scene also allows the audience to understand the present day Skinner, if only just a little better. Being such a sore loser as a child understandably molded him into the no-holds-barred businessman he currently is. However, that still doesn't explain why he's willing to sell this property. Was he not the happiest during his years there? Didn't his uncle mean anything to him? These are questions he'll eventually have to struggle with. He'll also have to struggle with repressed feelings that for years enabled him to forget the life he once had. The time spent on such thoughts becomes crucial; his personal assistant, Gemma (Archie Panjabi) is quick to point out that selling the chateau will not as simple as he thought it would be. She arranges for him to fly to France in order to assess the property's value and to meet with the local notaries.When he finally arrives at the chateau, he's immediately turned off by it. The greenery is a little too wild and overgrown. The walls of the house itself are caked with years of dirt and dust. The pool is empty, save for a thick layer of mud on the bottom. The disrepair of the estate is undeniable; however, just as undeniable is the underlying beauty that's just waiting to reemerge. It would seem that Henry's long time assistants--the passionate Francis Duflot (Didier Bourdon) and his bubbly yet dedicated wife, Ludivine (Isabelle Candelier)--are the only ones who understand how special both the chateau and vineyard are. They hold a wealth of memories, not just for them, but for Skinner, as well.Skinner initially plans to visit for one day. But through a series of work- and financially-related events, he's forced to stay a few days longer. Here begins his gradual awakening; he wanders the estate, looking for ways to make it sell faster, all the while uncovering many hidden memories that push him further and further into reacceptance. His mental turmoil is growing, and it gets even worse when he falls head over heals for Fanny Chenal (Marion Cotillard), a spunky and comically irrational woman who initially finds Skinner irritating (not helped by the fact that he almost ran her over during one of his drives). They play off of each other perfectly; both have experienced things that have made them emotionally distant, a fact that only makes the attraction even stronger.Everything reaches a crescendo when a young American woman lands on the doorstep. Her name is Christie Roberts (Abbie Cornish), and she claims to be Henry's long lost daughter. This puts a serious damper on Skinner's plans; the chateau may in fact belong to her, meaning that Skinner will be unable to sell it. It's immediately obvious that Christie has no real interest in owning a piece of property; she merely wants to learn about her father, if not through an actual meeting, then through his letters, pictures, and memoirs. Her very presence puts Skinner in a position he's clearly uncomfortable in, made even more uncomfortable by his growing fondness for his uncle's estate.It eventually becomes a matter of choosing; does Skinner want a life of money, or does he want a life, period? Should he sell his childhood home for financial gain, or should he embrace it (as he once did)? ""This place just doesn't suit my life,"" he says during one of his more speculative moments. ""No,"" replies Fanny. ""It is your life that doesn't suit this place."" Those bits of dialogue may have been simple, but they worked just the same; it effectively reiterates the film's message without getting too poetic. Almost everything else in this film works just as well; I'm recommending it for those who enjoy light-hearted yet important life-affirming stories. ""A Good Year"" has just the right mixture of heart and humor, making it virtually impossible to leave the theater feeling unsatisfied.",4,Vintage Entertainment,1163203200,"11 11,

Water mouthing hoem cooked dinner at the tenant's house.(2) Marion Cotillard as Fanny ChenalYoung, beautiful, hot and intelligent with a great wardrobe. She acted so natural and confidently. The film lighted up when she appeared on the screen.(3) Great bonding between Uncle Henry (Albert Finney) and young Max (Freddie Highmore)Chess, tennis, cricket, how to win and lose, all you need to know about red wine(4) A script with surprising twistsI like the way that the clues (Uncle Henry's will, the job at London, the expensive wine maker of the Lost Corner, the words whispered into young Max's ears) which were unfolded in the last 10 minutes(5) Interesting supporting charactersThe secretary(Archie Panjabi, Bend it like Beckham), the tenant Duflot(Didier Bourdon) and the Secretary (Tome Hollander, Mr. Collins in Pride and Prejudice)At the end, it is Marion Cotillard which is the decisive factor why Max (Russel Crowe) could go back to France.

""A Good Year"" will be remembered as a midpoint; not a pinnacle, but not a barrel bottom either. Which way will he go from here?Based on the Peter Mayle novel, the film chronicles the very contrived adventures of a ruthless business man as the magic of Provence turns him into a cuddly teddybear. That's pretty much it.He meets an alluring french girl (Marion Cotillard), argues with locals, has a conflict with his newly- discovered cousin (icky undertones), and finds his soul. What originality squeezed from that plot would have to be in fresh performances, and they just aren't there. Here's the rundown:The Good: Eh, not much. Truly spectacular cinematography. Misty vineyards and Monet-palate hillsides. Performance wise, only Archie Panjabi as Max's street smart, oddly loyal assistant stands out.The Ok: Russell himself. He's just not that into it. There are moments when we see him, the Russell Crowe of ""Rough Magic"" and all else pre-""Gladiator"", and there's a bit of the old electricity. But the rest of the time he just goes through the motions. The Crowe of ten years ago might have made something special of this. Albert Finney, as Max's irascible old uncle, is Albert Finney. Everybody else is just sort of there, taking up space and being forgettable.The Bad: A sub par script that fights pace-wise with Ridley Scott's edgy style. It just doesn't gel. We never really care all that much what happens to any of the characters, or the lovely chateau at the center of the conflict. And the chemistry between Marion Cotillard and Russell is nonexistent. Not even a spark.In conclusion, skip this one, at least until the DVD. It's hard to covey in words how not worth your time the film is. It's unpleasant where it should be sweet, dull where it should be deep, and off-putting where it should be sexy. The cast, I'm sure, had a great time drinking and dining in France, but we don't get to taste the food or the wine, so it's no party for us.

Russell Crowe and Ridley Scott follow-up their successful collaboration in Gladiator with A Good Year, a warm and fuzzy mid-life crisis dramedy (?!) that plays out like a sub par male version of Under the Tuscan Sun. Both men are horribly miscast for what amounts to a multi-million dollar paid vacation in France.The film's clumsy attempts at comedy include Max's rental car as an emasculating little stub of an automobile and his caretaker's dog peeing on his shoe. Russell Crowe tries his hand at light, physical comedy in the form of his character falling in an old, emptied out pool, unable to get out and so we get several minutes of the actor flailing about. This film seems like an ill fit for the actor despite his dedication to making it work. However, all of his hard work doesn't transcend the clich&eacute;-ridden screenplay that desperately needs a re-write from someone like James L. Brooks or Cameron Crowe who are much more attuned and familiar with the blending of comedy, drama and romance. At times it feels like he and Scott are killing time between more substantial projects and in fact they are teaming up again on a true crime epic entitled American Gangster. Let's hope it is much better than A Good Year.""Postcards from Provence"" is a combination of audio commentary, with director Ridley Scott and screenwriter Marc Klein, and a collection behind-the-scenes featurettes. The director talks about the editing choices he made, including how much of the flashbacks to keep. The featurettes blend rather nicely with the commentary, especially Scott's perceptive observations, making this an infinitely more interesting experience than the film itself.""Russell Crowe and Ridley Scott Promo"" features a brief conversation between the two men with clips from the movie.Also included are three trailers and four T.V. spots.For hardcore Crowe fans only are three music videos for songs the actor recorded with his new band the Extraordinary Fear of God.

1041753,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B000LXHK22,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[120, 126]","I really don't understand all the bad reviews from critics and reviewers alike for I personally loved this movie. Now, it's not the grandest spectacle to grace the big screen nor is it Russell Crowe's finest hour, but `A Good Year' is some quality entertainment and serves it purpose in the relaxed and happy season that is fall. Having just seen the poorly made and highly overrated `Catch a Fire' I was ready to relax and watch something entertaining and enjoyable, and being the Russell Crowe fan that I undoubtedly am I decided that `A Good Year' would be just that movie.Max Skinner (Crowe) is a stuck up British stock broker who at one time was a kind hearted soul, and his fondest memories are littered with his Uncle Henry (Finney) and his Chateau in France. Upon his Uncles death Max is left the sole owner of Henry's estate, and in like fashion he flies out there in order to sell if for profit and make it back ASAP. What he doesn't bank on is Christie Roberts (Abbie Cornish) showing up claiming to be the long lost daughter of Henry and claiming rights to his estate. Throughout the course of the film Max has to go through the stages of redemption, which include discovering the jerk he has become and rediscovering his inner child.The two key components to his wonderful film is the scenery and the acting. The script and storyline as some have already pointed out is very unoriginal, we've seen this done plenty of times, but the beauty that is France, as well as the beauty that is Russell Crowe and Marion Cotillard (who plays Fanny, the seductive woman who steals Max's heart) more than make up for the familiarity. Crowe is, as many know, my all time favorite actor ever, and I feel that he can carry any film he touches. Whether you are a fan of his phone throwing escapades or not, you have to admit that the man is gifted, very gifted. Here he proves that by being just as compelling and engrossing laughing and smiling as he is riding into battle. Albert Finney and Marion Cotillard are also wonderful here, but to me it was little Freddie Highmore (such a talented young man) who outshined most in the cast (can anyone outshine Crowe...I don't believe so).As I said in the beginning, I don't understand all the bad press. So what if it's no `A Beautiful Mind' or `Gladiator', so what if Russell was not Lucky Jack or James Braddock, `A Good Year' is still a good time and Max Skinner is just as fun as Crowe ever was. I recommend it, I enjoyed it, no better yet, I loved every minute of it.",5,A very 'Good' film indeed...,1167091200,"12 26, 2006",2006,2515,"['really', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'bad', 'reviews', 'critics', 'reviewers', 'personally', 'loved', 'movie', 'Now', 'not', 'grandest', 'spectacle', 'grace', 'big', 'screen', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'finest', 'hour', 'Good', 'Year', 'quality', 'entertainment', 'purpose', 'relaxed', 'happy', 'season', 'fall', 'Having', 'just', 'seen', 'poorly', 'made', 'highly', 'overrated', 'Catch', 'Fire', 'was', 'ready', 'relax', 'watch', 'something', 'entertaining', 'enjoyable', 'being', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'fan', 'undoubtedly', 'am', 'decided', 'Good', 'Year', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'movie.Max', 'Skinner', 'Crowe', 'stuck', 'up', 'British', 'stock', 'broker', 'who', 'one', 'time', 'was', 'kind', 'hearted', 'soul', 'fondest', 'memories', 'are', 'littered', 'Uncle', 'Henry', 'Finney', 'Chateau', 'France', 'Uncles', 'death', 'Max', 'left', 'sole', 'owner', 'Henry', 'estate', 'like', 'fashion', 'out', 'there', 'order', 'sell', 'profit', 'make', 'back', 'ASAP', 'What', ""n't"", 'bank', 'Christie', 'Roberts', 'Abbie', 'Cornish', 'showing', 'up', 'claiming', 'be', 'long', 'lost', 'daughter', 'Henry', 'claiming', 'rights', 'estate', 'course', 'film', 'Max', 'go', 'stages', 'redemption', 'include', 'discovering', 'jerk', 'become', 'rediscovering', 'inner', 'child.The', 'two', 'key', 'components', 'wonderful', 'film', 'scenery', 'acting', 'script', 'storyline', 'have', 'already', 'pointed', 'out', 'very', 'unoriginal', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'done', 'plenty', 'times', 'beauty', 'France', 'as', 'well', 'beauty', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'who', 'Fanny', 'seductive', 'woman', 'who', 'Max', 'heart', 'more', 'make', 'up', 'familiarity', 'Crowe', 'many', 'know', 'time', 'favorite', 'actor', 'ever', 'feel', 'can', 'carry', 'film', 'are', 'fan', 'phone', 'throwing', 'escapades', 'not', 'have', 'admit', 'man', 'gifted', 'very', 'gifted', 'Here', 'being', 'just', 'compelling', 'engrossing', 'laughing', 'smiling', 'riding', 'battle', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'are', 'also', 'wonderful', 'here', 'was', 'little', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'such', 'talented', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'outshined', 'most', 'cast', 'can', 'anyone', 'outshine', 'Crowe', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'so', '.As', 'said', 'beginning', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'bad', 'press', 'what', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'Gladiator', 'what', 'Russell', 'was', 'not', 'Lucky', 'Jack', 'James', 'Braddock', 'Good', 'Year', 'still', 'good', 'time', 'Max', 'Skinner', 'just', 'as', 'fun', 'Crowe', 'ever', 'was', 'recommend', 'enjoyed', 'better', 'yet', 'loved', 'minute']",N/A

1041759,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,B000LXHK22,Deborah Earle,"[0, 0]","Somewhere in the South of France, in a time not too distant from the present (in this film based on a book by Peter Mayle), an orphaned English lad (spiritedly portrayed by Freddie Highmore)and his wine-growing Uncle Henry(Albert Finney)share a special time at Henry's rustic cottage. It is here where young Max Skinner is given life lessons from  his Uncle, and he thrives in this environment.Years later, we see a grown-up Max(Russell Crowe), a cold and ruthless stock market trader with an aggressive employee(Rafe Spall) trying to take his place, an elegantly comical secretary of Indian extraction named Gemma(Archie Panjabi), and a James-Bond-like wittiness and sophistication.On the day Max Skinner becomes the toast of the London Stock Exchange, he receives word of Henry's death.We are given glimpses of Max's life when he dines at a local restaurant--the women he's scored with, and the friend and advisor Charlie Willis(Tom Hollander) who wonders why he is less contemplative of Henry's loss, and more focused on his stock market victory.Soon, he is off to France to return to the estate, La Siroque, for the first time since childhood with the intention of selling the property and hurrying back to London. But fate will soon intervene in unexpected ways.Throughout the film, there are flashbacks of Max's time with his uncle, which will provide insight about the man Max is to become.He proves to be a rather tempestuous guest in someone else's country, taunting the Tour de France trainees by whom he drives past by hollering Lance Armstrong's name as he gives them an obscene gesture.He finds the property to be dilapidated, and the wine undrinkable, but schemes with Charlie to make the property appear marketable.There are amusing scenes of Gemma paging her boss on his blackberry to his annoyance, and Crowe shows a little talent for physical comedy when a local waitress with the apt name of Fanny Chenal(Marion Cotillard), settles a score with him after he runs her off the road while she is on her bicycle.But there is nothing in this alleged comedy that makes one laugh out loud. The puns are merely eyebrow cocking and smirk provoking, and I felt there was something about Max's being zapped in the pool scene that was a bit too contrived.There are scenes of Max trying on his uncle's clothes, leading at one point to the obligatory cinematographic exploitation of the power and beauty of Crowe's glowing and fabulously rippling biceps.The resident vigneron, Francis Duflot(Didion Bourdon), whom Max has known since childhood, is dismayed by Max's decision to sell La Siroque, and has periodic hostile confrontations with him. Duflot's sunny, effervescent wife, Ludivine (Isabelle Candelier) serves as housekeeper, cook, and scorpion exterminator, and cannot hide her enthusiasm in seeing Max again. One moment I found particularly intriguing was the scene of her dancing to Henry's vinyl record featuring the song, ""Wedding Samba"" because my mother has played this tune frequently on the piano. The inclusion of this song in the film has been a pleasant surprise.Amid the lovliness of the French countryside, a new issue arises. A young Californian woman named Christie Roberts (Abbie Cornish) arrives at the estate claiming to be the out-of-wedlock daughter Henry never met.The spitefully competitive Max tries to find a legal way to discredit Christie and her claim to the estate, and even ruins a lovely evening dinner at the Duflots with his inebriated announcement of his suspicions.But a poignant scene emerges when Max expresses regret over never telling Henry he had loved him. The dewy look flooding Crowe's aquamarine eyes at that moment says it all.Back in London, suspension over illegal trading prolongs Max's time away from his job, and makes it a little easier for him to make some crucial life-altering decisions as he pursues Fanny.The plot line is fairly predictable, featuring the fulfillment of Max's desire for a tumble in the sack with Fanny, and the scene of his meeting with his boss, Sir Nigel (Kenneth Crahan), and the flashback of Max's childhood encounter with young Fanny(an already stunningly exotic Marine Casto, in a moment that ultimately proves the adage, ""A man chases a girl until she catches him"")help tie the story together. Max finds evidence to corroborate Christie's claim, and he pursues the things and people that he has learned to value most after nearly losing them. While Charlie Willis predicts Max's eventually becoming bored with life at the estate, the Provence sun shines favorably on our hero as we bid him au revoir.",3,A Life Comes Full Circle,1194307200,"11 6, 2007",2007,4593,"['Somewhere', 'South', 'France', 'time', 'not', 'too', 'distant', 'present', 'film', 'based', 'book', 'Peter', 'Mayle', 'orphaned', 'English', 'lad', 'spiritedly', 'portrayed', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'wine-growing', 'Uncle', 'Henry', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'share', 'special', 'time', 'Henry', 'rustic', 'cottage', 'here', 'where', 'young', 'Max', 'Skinner', 'given', 'life', 'lessons', 'Uncle', 'environment.Years', 'later', 'see', 'grown-up', 'Max', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'cold', 'ruthless', 'stock', 'market', 'trader', 'aggressive', 'employee', 'Rafe', 'Spall', 'trying', 'take', 'place', 'elegantly', 'comical', 'secretary', 'Indian', 'extraction', 'named', 'Gemma', 'Archie', 'Panjabi', 'James-Bond-like', 'wittiness', 'sophistication.On', 'day', 'Max', 'Skinner', 'toast', 'London', 'Stock', 'Exchange', 'word', 'Henry', 'death.We', 'are', 'given', 'glimpses', 'Max', 'life', 'when', 'local', 'restaurant', 'women', 'scored', 'friend', 'advisor', 'Charlie', 'Willis', 'Tom', 'Hollander', 'who', 'why', 'less', 'contemplative', 'Henry', 'loss', 'more', 'focused', 'stock', 'market', 'victory.Soon', 'France', 'return', 'estate', 'La', 'Siroque', 'first', 'time', 'childhood', 'intention', 'selling', 'property', 'hurrying', 'back', 'London', 'fate', 'will', 'soon', 'intervene', 'unexpected', 'film', 'are', 'flashbacks', 'Max', 'time', 'uncle', 'will', 'provide', 'insight', 'man', 'Max', 'become.He', 'proves', 'be', 'rather', 'tempestuous', 'guest', 'someone', 'else', 'country', 'taunting', 'Tour', 'de', 'France', 'trainees', 'whom', 'past', 'hollering', 'Lance', 'Armstrong', 'name', 'obscene', 'gesture.He', 'property', 'be', 'dilapidated', 'wine', 'undrinkable', 'schemes', 'Charlie', 'make', 'property', 'appear', 'are', 'amusing', 'scenes', 'Gemma', 'paging', 'boss', 'blackberry', 'annoyance', 'Crowe', 'little', 'talent', 'physical', 'comedy', 'when', 'local', 'waitress', 'apt', 'name', 'Fanny', 'Chenal', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'score', 'off', 'road', 'bicycle.But', 'nothing', 'alleged', 'comedy', 'one', 'laugh', 'loud', 'puns', 'are', 'merely', 'eyebrow', 'cocking', 'smirk', 'provoking', 'felt', 'was', 'something', 'Max', 'being', 'zapped', 'pool', 'scene', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'contrived.There', 'are', 'scenes', 'Max', 'trying', 'uncle', 'clothes', 'leading', 'one', 'point', 'obligatory', 'cinematographic', 'exploitation', 'power', 'beauty', 'Crowe', 'glowing', 'fabulously', 'rippling', 'biceps.The', 'resident', 'vigneron', 'Francis', 'Duflot', 'Didion', 'Bourdon', 'whom', 'Max', 'known', 'childhood', 'dismayed', 'Max', 'decision', 'sell', 'La', 'Siroque', 'periodic', 'hostile', 'confrontations', 'Duflot', 'sunny', 'effervescent', 'wife', 'Ludivine', 'Isabelle', 'Candelier', 'housekeeper', 'cook', 'scorpion', 'exterminator', 'can', 'not', 'hide', 'enthusiasm', 'seeing', 'Max', 'again', 'One', 'moment', 'found', 'particularly', 'intriguing', 'was', 'scene', 'dancing', 'Henry', 'vinyl', 'record', 'featuring', 'song', 'Wedding', 'Samba', 'mother', 'played', 'tune', 'frequently', 'piano', 'inclusion', 'song', 'film', 'been', 'pleasant', 'surprise.Amid', 'lovliness', 'French', 'countryside', 'new', 'issue', 'young', 'Californian', 'woman', 'named', 'Christie', 'Roberts', 'Abbie', 'Cornish', 'estate', 'claiming', 'be', 'out-of-wedlock', 'daughter', 'Henry', 'never', 'spitefully', 'competitive', 'Max', 'tries', 'find', 'legal', 'way', 'discredit', 'Christie', 'claim', 'estate', 'even', 'lovely', 'evening', 'dinner', 'Duflots', 'inebriated', 'announcement', 'suspicions.But', 'poignant', 'scene', 'emerges', 'when', 'Max', 'regret', 'never', 'telling', 'Henry', 'had', 'loved', 'dewy', 'look', 'flooding', 'Crowe', 'aquamarine', 'eyes', 'moment', 'all.Back', 'London', 'suspension', 'illegal', 'trading', 'prolongs', 'Max', 'time', 'away', 'job', 'little', 'easier', 'make', 'crucial', 'life-altering', 'decisions', 'Fanny.The', 'plot', 'line', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'featuring', 'fulfillment', 'Max', 'desire', 'tumble', 'sack', 'Fanny', 'scene', 'meeting', 'boss', 'Sir', 'Nigel', 'Kenneth', 'Crahan', 'flashback', 'Max', 'childhood', 'encounter', 'young', 'Fanny', 'already', 'stunningly', 'exotic', 'Marine', 'Casto', 'moment', 'ultimately', 'adage', 'man', 'girl', 'help', 'tie', 'story', 'together', 'Max', 'evidence', 'corroborate', 'Christie', 'claim', 'things', 'people', 'learned', 'value', 'most', 'nearly', 'losing', 'Charlie', 'Willis', 'Max', 'eventually', 'becoming', 'bored', 'life', 'estate', 'Provence', 'sun', 'shines', 'favorably', 'hero', 'bid', 'au', 'revoir']",N/A

1041763,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B000LXHK22,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[5, 11]","Pair Gladiator director Ridley Scott together with his Academy Award winning Maximus, aka Russell Crowe and you would expect to come away with something with a little more bouquet than the sappy vinegar served up in this scenically -pleasing, feel-good wannabe about a London bonds trader's epiphany about love and life in the south of France.  Sadly, even with the golden halcyon veneer of too many lazy Provencal afternoons, A Good Year fails to deliver the grapes; the revelational concoction of savoring little moments while discovering beautiful sun-kissed people amidst fields of Van Gogh blues and yellows gets lost in the structural miasma of a truly bad script. Scott's bucolic suggestion of home where Maximus of Gladiator repeatedly and lovingly fingers his growing grain in the Roman outreach of Iberia to the strains of Hans Zimmer's hypnotic score relays more of the essence of Mayle's original idea for ""A Good Year"" than the film's entire 114 minute playing time.Its not that Russell Crowe can't do romantic comedy; he certainly possesses the charm, talent and good looks,  Although he seems highly suited for his Londonderry Gordon Gekko counterpart, he appears to have taken just a little too much Prozac for the idyllic south of France scenes where a spacey grin facilitates eternal contemplation of his early life with his life-lusty uncle (Albert Finney) spent on the family's vineyard  The hodgepodge script ping-pongs back and forth as the adult Crowe, inheritor of his uncle's estate, meanders towards the realization that a future  life on the vineyard will far exceed one cutting people's financial throats on the London exchange.What's painful about this film is that it tries too hard to come off as the intoxicating magical adventure that it was intended to be. It brags of an emotional depth of expression that it does not possess.  Unlike other films that rely heavily on location to evoke a sense of timeless beauty----Under the Tuscan Sun comes to mind----A Good Year fails to embrace the audience, pull it in and keep it bedazzled.  In romantic comedy, a degree of formula is expected, even desired, but there is nothing here that allows one to lose oneself in the panorama of delight that although advertised, does not exist on any level.Bottom line?  If you enjoy the ""chuck it all and buy a ramshackle farm in some remote and timeless corner of the world"" genre, you may be as tempted as I was to thoroughly fantasize for over two hours of doing just so.  Don't.

A very busy high pressured stock trader inherits his uncle's chateau and vineyard in Provence, where he spent much of his childhood. He discovers a new laid-back lifestyle as he tries to renovate the estate to be sold per IMDB's plot line. That's pretty much it in a nutshell plus in addition that he finds love and discovers a few facts about his uncle and childhood. I'm not sure about the role of his long lost cousin and Uncles love child, didn't really see a point to her role in the film. The movie a slow moving, but isn't that the point? Busy guy finds laid back lifestyle? So as one would think the trading shots are fast while most of the movie shot at the chateau and in and around Provence are slow and easy going. Myself having forsaken the busy life in exchange for the rural slower life can relate to this film and I found it enjoyable, my wife found it enjoyable. It's a good dinner and movie film, not action packed adventure, not a side splitting comedy, it's not a shoot'em up film, but that doesn't mean it is to be dismissed either.

Russell Crowe stars as a brash, arrogant, ruthless and obnoxious financial Trader in the 'City' in London. He lives only for 'bread' (hippie lingo for money), that is money and more money! Actually, his life is cold and meaningless but he does not realise it until he goes to Provence to a winery, his beloved Uncle Henry (played superbly by Albert Finney), has left him on his demise. He recalls his idyllic childhood there and falls in love with a beautiful French lady played by Marion Cotillard who owns a restaurant. A ravishing actress who also stars with immense success as Edith Piaf in 'La vie en rose' where you see her incredibly transformed into a haggard, hunchbacked 47 year old Edith Piaf. Her expressive eyes and charming French finesse steals the show here as well. Moments of comedy are a bit contrived, especially where Russell falls in the disused swimming pool. However, the half sister of Russell's character is also very attractive. Those who love wine and Provence like I do will love this movie. Provence is magical and when I was there recently in my capacity as The Travelling Gourmet, a Travel, Food and Wine Writer, my friend Rachel brought me to so many superb wineries like Domaine Grangeneuve and M. Chapoutier. Provence has a shimmering etheral beauty that tranfixes and tranforms you somehow. This happens to Russell's character in this movie. he becomes a much better and nicer person. He finally tells his boss, who knows only materialism and will never achieve 'nirvana' or understand that there are many things that money simply cannot buy, simply that you can keep your promotion, I have something better to go to. I saw this movie flying to Amsterdam on a nice KLM Boeing 777 flight enroute to sunny Italy, you guessed it, to study, taste and tour more wineries.The love of a beautiful woman, the taste of good wines from Provence and Rhone-Alpes on your palate, the sight of the cool early morning mist in the gardens of Maison Pic in Valance, the flavours of Anne Pic's extraordinary cuisine in her restaurant (3 Michelin stars), all these are things money simply can never buy.

1041773,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000LXHK22,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 3]","I have to admit this 2006 movie based on the book by Peter Mayle (whose ""A Year in Provence"" is a favorite of mine) starts rather unpromisingly since it carries the same smug, self-satisfied attitude that its hero has. Director Ridley Scott takes a while to find the right rhythm for this romantic comedy, but he eventually does, even if it means recycling elements from other similarly executed fish-out-of-water films like ""Baby Boom"", ""Lost in Translation"" and ""Under the Tuscan Sun"". In fact, the whole venture feels decidedly old-fashioned with formula elements feeling like they come from some Universal film made in the 1960's, but the retro-chic aspect somehow works like a fictionalized account of a lifestyle cable channel program since there is little in the way of real dramatic conflict.Atypically cast in a lighter vein here, the naturally pugnacious Russell Crowe seems to be channeling one of the Grants (Cary or Hugh, take your pick) in portraying a Machiavellian-level London investment banker named Max Skinner, who unexpectedly inherits a dilapidated chateau and vineyard in Provence from his uncle Henry, a figure he loved as a child but has since become estranged due to Max's selfish, greed-obsessed existence. Written by Marc Klein, the bulk of the movie is about what Max does with the estate as he argues with the longtime vintner and becomes entwined with two women - pretty Christie, who claims to be Henry's illegitimate daughter from a tryst with an American, and the too-perfectly-named Fanny Chanel, a beautiful local restaurateur who tries mightily to resist Max's romantic overtures after a most bumpy start. As Max weighs his options, his unforgiving career and jet-setting lifestyle back in London appear to be in jeopardy.More like a Cagney than a Grant, Crowe has the type of aggressive screen persona that takes on all comers, so he seems more in his element being a jerk. However, he acquits himself more than you would expect as the story begins to humanize his character, and he is more deft as a comic actor than even Scott presumes. For example, there are extended sequences in an empty swimming pool and during a tennis match when Scott seems to mistake action for slapstick. Max may be Crowe's most likeable role since the loving gay son he played in the 1994 Australian indie, ""The Sum of Us"". In flashbacks, Freddie Highmore, Johnny Depp's prot&eacute;g&eacute; in ""Finding Neverland"" and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", affectingly plays Max as a child, even though the lack of physical resemblance is a bit jarring. Better is Albert Finney as rhapsodizing Uncle Henry since his casting harkens back to the actor's youth in south-of-France-set movies like ""Two for the Road"" and ""The Picasso Summer"" in the late sixties.Australian actress Abbie Cornish convincingly portrays a guileless American with more than a passing interest in wine, while Marion Cotillard is a stunning, feisty presence as Fanny (although the obvious age disparity between her and Crowe makes some of the back story a bit of a head scratch). Entertaining though more standard rom-com contributions are made by Tom Hollander as Max's realtor best friend Charlie (in an update of the usual Gig Young third-wheel role), Didier Bourdon and Isabelle Candelier as caretaker Duflot and his playful wife, and Archie Panjabi as Max's jaded but devoted assistant Gemma. The wine-growing region of Provence hardly needs more exposure in movies, but Philippe Le Sourd's cinematography brings it glowingly to life. A most idiosyncratic soundtrack accompanies the film with genre-irrelevant chestnuts like Patti Page's ""Old Cape Cod"", Harry Nilsson's ""Gotta Get Up"" and a French cover version of ""Yellow Polka-Dot Bikini"" by Richard Anthony. This is the kind of movie where you can see the ending a mile away, but I have to say for the most part, I enjoyed the ride.",4,The Romantic Emancipation of Russell Crowe,1163289600,"11 12, 2006",2006,3879,"['have', 'admit', '2006', 'movie', 'based', 'book', 'Peter', 'Mayle', 'Year', 'Provence', 'favorite', 'mine', 'rather', 'unpromisingly', 'same', 'smug', 'self-satisfied', 'attitude', 'hero', 'Director', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'while', 'find', 'right', 'rhythm', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'eventually', 'even', 'recycling', 'elements', 'other', 'similarly', 'executed', 'fish-out-of-water', 'films', 'Baby', 'Boom', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'Tuscan', 'Sun', 'fact', 'whole', 'venture', 'feels', 'decidedly', 'old-fashioned', 'formula', 'elements', 'feeling', 'come', 'Universal', 'film', 'made', '1960', 'retro-chic', 'aspect', 'somehow', 'fictionalized', 'account', 'lifestyle', 'cable', 'channel', 'program', 'little', 'way', 'real', 'dramatic', 'conflict.Atypically', 'cast', 'lighter', 'vein', 'here', 'naturally', 'pugnacious', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'be', 'channeling', 'one', 'Grants', 'Cary', 'Hugh', 'take', 'pick', 'portraying', 'Machiavellian-level', 'London', 'investment', 'banker', 'named', 'Max', 'Skinner', 'who', 'unexpectedly', 'dilapidated', 'chateau', 'vineyard', 'Provence', 'uncle', 'Henry', 'figure', 'loved', 'child', 'become', 'estranged', 'due', 'Max', 'selfish', 'greed-obsessed', 'existence', 'Written', 'Marc', 'Klein', 'bulk', 'movie', 'what', 'Max', 'estate', 'longtime', 'vintner', 'becomes', 'entwined', 'two', 'women', 'pretty', 'Christie', 'who', 'be', 'Henry', 'illegitimate', 'daughter', 'tryst', 'American', 'too-perfectly-named', 'Fanny', 'Chanel', 'beautiful', 'local', 'restaurateur', 'who', 'mightily', 'resist', 'Max', 'romantic', 'overtures', 'most', 'bumpy', 'start', 'Max', 'options', 'unforgiving', 'career', 'jet-setting', 'lifestyle', 'back', 'London', 'appear', 'be', 'jeopardy.More', 'Cagney', 'Grant', 'Crowe', 'type', 'aggressive', 'screen', 'persona', 'comers', 'more', 'element', 'being', 'jerk', 'However', 'more', 'would', 'expect', 'story', 'humanize', 'character', 'more', 'deft', 'comic', 'actor', 'even', 'Scott', 'presumes', 'example', 'are', 'extended', 'sequences', 'empty', 'swimming', 'pool', 'tennis', 'match', 'when', 'Scott', 'mistake', 'action', 'slapstick', 'Max', 'may', 'be', 'Crowe', 'most', 'likeable', 'role', 'loving', 'gay', 'son', 'played', '1994', 'Australian', 'indie', 'Sum', 'Us', 'flashbacks', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'affectingly', 'Max', 'child', 'even', 'lack', 'physical', 'resemblance', 'bit', 'jarring', 'Better', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'rhapsodizing', 'Uncle', 'Henry', 'casting', 'back', 'actor', 'youth', 'south-of-France-set', 'movies', 'Two', 'Road', 'Picasso', 'Summer', 'late', 'sixties.Australian', 'actress', 'Abbie', 'Cornish', 'convincingly', 'guileless', 'American', 'more', 'passing', 'interest', 'wine', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'stunning', 'feisty', 'presence', 'Fanny', 'obvious', 'age', 'disparity', 'Crowe', 'back', 'story', 'bit', 'head', 'scratch', 'Entertaining', 'more', 'standard', 'rom-com', 'contributions', 'are', 'made', 'Tom', 'Hollander', 'Max', 'realtor', 'best', 'friend', 'Charlie', 'update', 'usual', 'Gig', 'Young', 'third-wheel', 'role', 'Didier', 'Bourdon', 'Isabelle', 'Candelier', 'caretaker', 'Duflot', 'playful', 'wife', 'Archie', 'Panjabi', 'Max', 'jaded', 'devoted', 'assistant', 'Gemma', 'wine-growing', 'region', 'Provence', 'hardly', 'more', 'exposure', 'movies', 'Philippe', 'Le', 'Sourd', 'cinematography', 'glowingly', 'life', 'most', 'idiosyncratic', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'genre-irrelevant', 'chestnuts', 'Patti', 'Page', 'Old', 'Cape', 'Cod', 'Harry', 'Nilsson', 'Got', 'ta', 'Get', 'Up', 'French', 'cover', 'version', 'Yellow', 'Polka-Dot', 'Bikini', 'Richard', 'Anthony', 'kind', 'movie', 'where', 'can', 'see', 'ending', 'mile', 'away', 'have', 'say', 'most', 'part', 'enjoyed', 'ride']",N/A

Director/Producer Ridley Scott uses Provence, France, as the visually intoxicating backdrop for this smart, romantic comedy, while Director of Photography Philippe Le Sourd plants us in the middle of a beautiful painting as we watch the story unfold.""A Good Year"" is perfectly cast, with Albert Finney, Freddie Highmore and Abbie Cornish in key roles. Russell Crowe, perhaps the industry's finest dramatic actor, proves without a doubt the former Gladiator does indeed have a softer, more gentle side to him; some viewers may be surprised at how well Crowe moves effortlessly from one scene to another, displaying a gift for the timing and flare that is so crucial to a successful comedy. Considering his body of work as a serious dramatic actor, this film is a nice change of pace for him - and an enjoyable one at that.For those who have seen the film and found it a bit hard to follow, it is important to remember that intelligent, well thought out scripts, like this one by Marc Klein, require the viewer to pay a little more attention than usual in order to better grasp the thought process behind the film's direction. I found the inspirational conversations between Finney and Freddie Highmore ( who plays Crowe as a young boy) to be particularly thought-provoking and well-written.Like most DVDs these days, ""A Good Year"" includes a director's commentary. Some are good, while others simply put you to sleep. That said, I have to say that I have never enjoyed a commentary as much as I did this one (""Gladiator"" comes in a close second). Ridley Scott provides us with a new commentary format that includes a ""feature-length hybrid of video featurettes"" that accompany his and screenwriter Klein's comments. I say 'new"" because I had never experienced this form of commentary before. Nevertheless, I found it to be very entertaining and much more informative than most.Bottom line: If you're a big Russell Crowe fan, and enjoy good comedy set in a beautiful, European backdrop, this one's for you.

He is a very talented actor, one of the best of his generation. He is especially good and convincing at playing strong, charismatic, intense, and often brooding characters but I've noticed that I like him the most when he smiles. He does not do it often, on the contrary, his smile is a rare gift but it changes his face completely, it literally lights his face, makes it younger, softer, and even tender. I have always been curious to see him in a light and funny comedy and when I learned that he and Ridley Scott who has directed him to the Oscar in ""The Gladiator"" teamed up for a romantic comedy that takes place in the vineyard of sunny Provence, in the south of France, I was very interested in seeing it.I should say that even though I had expected more from the movie, it was nice. The story is very familiar and predictable but the film is a delight to watch since it was made by a master of the stunningly beautiful visuals, the master who can look at the familiar landmark from the different prospective, the way nobody else has. The best about ""A Good Year"" is its look - dreamy, enveloping, delightfully intoxicating - just as wine that plays such a big role in the story of Max Skinner (Russell Crowe) who one day suddenly finds himself back in the place where he used to be happy once as a boy but almost forgot the feeling having left for a huge dynamic mega polis where he has become a ruthless arrogant businessman. He will have to slow down and to learn what the real pleasures, values, and priorities in life are. Once more, Russell Crowe has proved that he can act but I found his performance a little too heavy and intense for such a silly light comedy. Watching him in ""A Good Year"" reminds me of an old story. A famous comic actor, lying on his deathbed, was asked by a friend, ""Is it hard, this dying?"" ""No,"" replied the actor. ""Dying is easy. Comedy is hard."" I was glad to see Crowe in the comedy even if not completely successful and there was one absolutely charming and hilarious scene with Crowe driving the smallest and cutest car imaginable which brought to my mind the similar scene in the latest Woody Allen's comedy. I began to wonder what Woody Allen's next project would be. What if two of them, Allen and Crowe will get to work together? That would be a comedy I will never miss.",3,"""Dying is easy.

1041784,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000LXHK22,Grady Harp,"[0, 2]","Peter Mayle's popular novel 'A Year in Provence' has been transferred to the screen by screenwriter Marc Klein under the odd direction of Ridley Scott, best known for such films as 'Hannibal', 'Gladiator', 'Matchstick Men', 'Thelma and Louise', 'Black Hawk Down', 'Blade Runner' etc. and the result may surprise many viewers.  No, this is not a shocker of a film but rather a too familiar tale of a man obsessed with making money who inherits a vineyard and chateau in Provence from the uncle that served as his family as a child and in returning to the old estate, finds the earth and his memories too long buried about how he loved the space of arrested time of his childhood.The man is British financial wizard Max Skinner (Russell Crowe in a very subdued performance) who as a young bright lad (Freddie Highmore) lived with Uncle Henry Skinner (Albert Finney), learning the ins and outs of growing grapes and making wine.  Max returns to the chateau after Uncle Henry's death with all intentions of polishing up the neglected place to place on the market to make yet more money.  The live-in couple who maintain the place (Francis Duflot - Didier Bourdon - and his wife Ludivine - Isabelle Candelier) challenge Max's decision to sell the place, hiding some secrets about the vintages that will eventually alter the course of the story.  Max slowly falls in love with his memories of his childhood, reconnecting with his love for his uncle, discovering a young beauty Fanny (Marion Cotillard) who owns a bistro and was actually a childhood 'friend' to Max, and also discovering that the philandering uncle had an illegitimate daughter Christie (Abbie Cornish) who visits the chateau to get to know who her father was (bringing along a deep knowledge of winemaking from California's Napa Valley!).  The film is then a struggle between Max's obsession with money as abetted by his home coworkers Gemma (Archie Panjabi) and Charlie (Tom Hollander) and his changing need and love for the life and memories bound tightly to his Provence chateau.  How it all works out is the relaxing if predictable finale of the story.The cast is attractive (including even a bit part for the beautiful and talented Valeria Bruni Tedeschi!) and seem to meld with Ridley Scott's concept of offering a little fluff of French dessert.  It is light in vein but beautiful to look at and it is interesting to see Scott and Crowe together in a non-violent venture!

The book was fantastic, a breezy novel that was sort of a literary breath of fresh air. It was funny, had likeable characters, and was just an all around fun book. Its movie version has its moments of charm and is mildly funny, but it should've stuck to the plotline the book followed and not deleted several key plot points. Russell Crowe plays Max Skinner; a ruthless, English businessman who nearly loses his job on the same day he finds out his beloved Uncle Henry (Albert Finney) has died. Being Henry's only next of kind, Max has inherited Henry's home and adjacent vineyard. Needing a vacation, Max heads back there and soon begins reliving all his great memories there while simultaneously trying to figure out how to sell the place much to the dismay of the outspoken Francis Duflot (Didier Bourdon), the man who takes care of the vines. On the eve of selling it, an American woman named Christie (Abbie Cornish, the talented actress from the film ""Candy"") shows up at the house claiming to be Henry's daughter...A daughter that Henry never met, leaving Max in a possible legal battle for the house. Living under the same roof with Christie, Max also finds love with a French woman named Fanny (Marion Cotillard) while Max's best friend Charlie (Tom Hollander) begins falling for Christie. Anyway, in the thank you section of the book Mayle thanks Ridley Scott for helping him come up with the idea for the story. Naturally, Scott had to direct the film version. Why he read the adaptation and chose to use it is a mystery. The movie version is likeable, but nowhere near as good as the book was. I mean, this movie is the epitome of where people go wrong adapting novels. Characters have been changed, the plot has been changed; some characters are incredibly one-dimensional, etc. Crowe works perfectly as Skinner, although Skinner's character is quite different from the one you encounter in the book. Having already impressed me for her brave performance in ""Candy,"" Cornish also shows how charming she can be. ""A Good Year"" reminded me of two other films...""Under the Tuscan Sun"" and ""Sideways."" The former because it has a foreigner in a different country (in that case, an American in Italy) and the latter because it has to do with wine. Both films were much better than ""A Good Year."" I haven't read much into what other people think about the film, but you must realize while reading this that I didn't quite walk into the movie with an open mind. Maybe, big maybe, if you haven't read the book you'll enjoy the film. The book is much better, but the film version is not a complete waste of time.BOTTOM LINE: Read the book!GRADE: C+",3,Read the Book,1177718400,"04 28, 2007",2007,2748,"['Having', 'recently', 'read', 'book', 'Good', 'Year', 'Peter', 'Mayle', 'was', 'eager', 'see', 'film', 'version', 'book', 'was', 'fantastic', 'breezy', 'novel', 'was', 'sort', 'literary', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'was', 'funny', 'had', 'likeable', 'characters', 'was', 'just', 'fun', 'book', 'movie', 'version', 'moments', 'charm', 'mildly', 'funny', 'should', ""'ve"", 'stuck', 'plotline', 'book', 'followed', 'not', 'deleted', 'several', 'key', 'plot', 'points', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Max', 'Skinner', 'ruthless', 'English', 'businessman', 'who', 'nearly', 'job', 'same', 'day', 'out', 'beloved', 'Uncle', 'Henry', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'died', 'Being', 'Henry', 'only', 'next', 'kind', 'Max', 'inherited', 'Henry', 'home', 'adjacent', 'vineyard', 'Needing', 'vacation', 'Max', 'back', 'soon', 'begins', 'reliving', 'great', 'memories', 'there', 'simultaneously', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'sell', 'place', 'much', 'dismay', 'outspoken', 'Francis', 'Duflot', 'Didier', 'Bourdon', 'man', 'who', 'care', 'vines', 'eve', 'selling', 'American', 'woman', 'named', 'Christie', 'Abbie', 'Cornish', 'talented', 'actress', 'film', 'Candy', 'up', 'house', 'claiming', 'be', 'Henry', 'daughter', 'daughter', 'Henry', 'never', 'met', 'leaving', 'Max', 'possible', 'legal', 'battle', 'house', 'Living', 'same', 'roof', 'Christie', 'Max', 'also', 'love', 'French', 'woman', 'named', 'Fanny', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'Max', 'best', 'friend', 'Charlie', 'Tom', 'Hollander', 'falling', 'Christie', 'Anyway', 'thank', 'section', 'book', 'Mayle', 'thanks', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'helping', 'come', 'up', 'idea', 'story', 'Naturally', 'Scott', 'had', 'direct', 'film', 'version', 'Why', 'read', 'adaptation', 'chose', 'use', 'mystery', 'movie', 'version', 'likeable', 'nowhere', 'as', 'good', 'book', 'was', 'mean', 'movie', 'epitome', 'where', 'people', 'go', 'wrong', 'adapting', 'novels', 'Characters', 'have', 'been', 'changed', 'plot', 'been', 'changed', 'characters', 'are', 'incredibly', 'one-dimensional', 'etc', 'Crowe', 'perfectly', 'Skinner', 'Skinner', 'character', 'quite', 'different', 'one', 'encounter', 'book', 'Having', 'already', 'impressed', 'brave', 'performance', 'Candy', 'Cornish', 'also', 'how', 'charming', 'can', 'be', 'Good', 'Year', 'reminded', 'two', 'other', 'films', 'Tuscan', 'Sun', 'Sideways', 'former', 'foreigner', 'different', 'country', 'case', 'American', 'Italy', 'latter', 'do', 'wine', 'films', 'were', 'much', 'better', 'Good', 'Year', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'much', 'what', 'other', 'people', 'think', 'film', 'must', 'realize', 'reading', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'walk', 'movie', 'open', 'mind', 'Maybe', 'big', 'maybe', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'film', 'book', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'version', 'not', 'complete', 'waste', 'time.BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'Read', 'book', 'GRADE', 'C+']",N/A

The script doesn't offer anything we haven't seen before, it's just a schmaltzy tale about a man who learns some life lessons and falls in love in the process.The problem with the movie is that has an incredibly hard time trying to find its footing. Ridley Scott knows how to use the setting to really capture the essence of a story, and he undoubtedly does that. However, there were some scenes where I was just wondering what was going on. It was as if I were watching a cartoon, especially in one scene where Russell Crowe drives around a fountain in his Smartcar in fast motion. Some choices I seriously questioned, and I usually don't question Ridley Scott. Okay, now let's move onto the positive side of the film. Once we get into the second act the film does indeed find its footing and stays with a consistent tone. We can finally relax and watch the movie for what it is. The characters are all really great even though they are pretty flat. The film is also beautifully shot, which is the essence of a Ridley Scott film. He contrasts England and France perfectly, and honestly I think that's the reason he took the project. When he read the script and saw that the essence of the film was a man out of place in his surroundings I'm sure that intrigued him. Unfortunately we don't go very far, and the lessons learned are pretty simple and not too meaningful. Visually the film is stunning, and musically there were some great choices. A lot of great songs are chosen to help the movie move along. Marc Streitenfield makes his head composer debut with A Good Year. Streitenfield previously worked with Hans Zimmer at Media Ventures and was a close assistant and editor for Zimmer. Streitenfield's score is very light and creates the right tone for the film, I cannot help but hear the similarities to previous Zimmer scores. As a Hans Zimmer fan I'm saying that in a good way though.ACTING: Russell Crowe is a great actor, whether you hate his real-life antics or not. He plays a stuck-up British stock broker who rekindles his childhood memories with his life loving uncle. He saves the movie and makes it entertaining to watch, and as an audience we can accept the fact that he is a bit cold-hearted and we want him to warm up. So, instead saying ""hurry up and learn your life lesson"", we can enjoy the character discovering the lessons for himself. The supporting cast also add great charm to the film's tone.BOTTOM LINE: The film made me smile. I laughed a bit and felt good, especially during a scene where Russell Crowe drives by some French bikers, flips them off, and yells ""LANCE ARMSTRONG!"". The acting is decent and it's a good movie. The only problem is that the story is a bit unoriginal and the tone is rarely consistent. Wait for DVD, not a must see in theaters. Hopefully Ridley Scott will be more in his element when American Gangster comes out next year.",3,"Ridley Scott's Light-hearted Fare Has A Hard Time Finding Its Footing, But I Smiled & I Enjoyed It For What It Was",1163376000,"11 13, 2006",2006,3353,"['MOVIE', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'proven', 'when', 'comedy', 'light-hearted', 'fares', 'Thelma', 'Louise', 'Matchstick', 'Men', 'were', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'family', 'films', 'were', 'certainly', 'different', 'action', 'know', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'can', 'masterfully', 'do', 'Scott', 'took', 'lot', 'heat', 'Kingdom', 'Heaven', 'who', 'purchased', 'saw', 'director', 'cut', 'know', 'film', 'was', 'unjustly', 'cut', 'down', 'ruined', 'Good', 'Year', 'other', 'hand', 'just', 'not', 'great', 'project', 'script', ""n't"", 'offer', 'anything', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'just', 'schmaltzy', 'tale', 'man', 'who', 'life', 'lessons', 'falls', 'love', 'process.The', 'problem', 'movie', 'incredibly', 'hard', 'time', 'trying', 'find', 'footing', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'how', 'use', 'setting', 'really', 'capture', 'essence', 'story', 'undoubtedly', 'However', 'were', 'scenes', 'where', 'was', 'just', 'wondering', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'was', 'were', 'watching', 'cartoon', 'especially', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'around', 'fountain', 'Smartcar', 'fast', 'motion', 'choices', 'seriously', 'questioned', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'question', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'Okay', 'now', 'let', 'move', 'positive', 'side', 'film', 'get', 'second', 'act', 'film', 'indeed', 'find', 'footing', 'stays', 'consistent', 'tone', 'can', 'finally', 'relax', 'watch', 'movie', 'what', 'characters', 'are', 'really', 'great', 'even', 'are', 'pretty', 'flat', 'film', 'also', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'essence', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'film', 'England', 'France', 'perfectly', 'honestly', 'think', 'reason', 'took', 'project', 'When', 'read', 'script', 'saw', 'essence', 'film', 'was', 'man', 'place', 'surroundings', ""'m"", 'sure', 'intrigued', 'Unfortunately', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'very', 'far', 'lessons', 'learned', 'are', 'pretty', 'simple', 'not', 'too', 'meaningful', 'Visually', 'film', 'stunning', 'musically', 'were', 'great', 'choices', 'lot', 'great', 'songs', 'are', 'chosen', 'help', 'movie', 'move', 'along', 'Marc', 'Streitenfield', 'head', 'composer', 'debut', 'Good', 'Year', 'Streitenfield', 'previously', 'worked', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'Media', 'Ventures', 'was', 'close', 'assistant', 'editor', 'Zimmer', 'Streitenfield', 'score', 'very', 'light', 'right', 'tone', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'hear', 'similarities', 'previous', 'Zimmer', 'scores', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'fan', ""'m"", 'saying', 'good', 'way', 'though.ACTING', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'great', 'actor', 'hate', 'real-life', 'antics', 'not', 'stuck-up', 'British', 'stock', 'broker', 'who', 'childhood', 'memories', 'life', 'loving', 'uncle', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'audience', 'can', 'accept', 'fact', 'bit', 'cold-hearted', 'want', 'warm', 'up', 'So', 'instead', 'saying', 'hurry', 'up', 'learn', 'life', 'lesson', 'can', 'enjoy', 'character', 'discovering', 'lessons', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'great', 'charm', 'film', 'tone.BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'film', 'made', 'smile', 'laughed', 'bit', 'felt', 'good', 'especially', 'scene', 'where', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'drives', 'French', 'bikers', 'off', 'LANCE', 'ARMSTRONG', 'acting', 'decent', 'good', 'movie', 'only', 'problem', 'story', 'bit', 'unoriginal', 'tone', 'rarely', 'consistent', 'Wait', 'DVD', 'not', 'must', 'see', 'theaters', 'Hopefully', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'element', 'when', 'American', 'Gangster', 'out', 'next', 'year']",N/A

These benefits are illustrated by the next two paragraphs.There is absolutely beautiful cinematography.  Depictions of Provence, a region of France adjacent to both the Mediterranean Sea and Italy, were bountiful and beautiful.  Director Ridley Scott's showcasing of the scenes representing Provence is enough to make one consider clicking the ""complete order"" button for a 14-day European vacation extravaganza.That catchy little tune by Alizee, ""Moi Lolita"", made a brief appearance in the movie which catapulted the song back into my consciousness.  The song, of course, is one of many attempts by the media to capitalize on the cultural sensation of Vladimir Nabokov's controversial novel, ""Lolita"", but that is another story entirely.*plot summation information below*The essence of the story is the tired clich&eacute; of greedy, amoral pig finding meaning, love, and purpose via the simple equation of:  abandoned family estate + attractive native love interest + beautiful French countryside = happiness.  Max (Russell Crowe) is a wildly successful but unscrupulous power broker, who never met a market he didn't want to manipulate.  Following a particularly successful business adventure, his assistant clues him in to the possibility that he is at risk of being investigated by the trade regulatory commission.  As a partial solution, she and his superiors recommend that he take a temporary leave of absence from the company, preferably out of the country, until the heat dies down.  As luck would have it, Max's uncle recently died in Provence, and since he left no will, the winery previously under his care is automatically bequeathed to Max, as he is the closest known relative.*end plot summation information*Many have complained about the sheer predictability of the plot, and that is definitely a negative aspect of this film, but not necessarily a terminal one.  What did kill my enjoyment of the film is the utterly nonsensical editing.  Scenes flash by without any semblance of explanation.  Cut to a conversation, seemingly for no reason at all, explain nothing, and then cut do the next scene just as one is beginning to soak up the scenery.  Include several characters in scenes without any actual suggested or implied reason for their placement there.  Speed up the action in one or two semi-montage scenes in the vein of a physical-comedy film, with no pre- or post-scene comedic introduction or resolution.  Finally, splice in a post-""fin"" scene which could only be described as surreal.In essence, this movie was 200 mini-films spliced into one.  At least, that's the impression I got, and it totally destroyed my suspension of disbelief.  There are other negatives:  the lame stereotyping (of secretaries, of Americans, of European humor), plots that go nowhere (""good""/""bad"" wine secret ""conspiracy""), and humor attempts which can only be labeled as ""wince-inducing"", among many, many other detrimental attributes.Not even worth renting, unless your friend has already rented it, AND you have cleaned all the gunk you could reasonably be expected to clean out of your fingernails already.Romantic comedy lovers:  this is neither romantic nor funny, so if you just HAVE to see the handsome Russell Crowe or the beautiful Marion Cotillard, buy a poster instead.""Gladiator"" or ""Black Hawk Down"" fans:  no, even with the breakneck editing, it is still not an action movie.Scenery fans:  turn off the audio, fast-forward to the ""scenery"" scenes, and keep the Semillon flowing...I would recommend three bottles per person.",2,Good luck being granted a second date if you took her to this on your FIRST date,1176076800,"04 9, 2007",2007,3630,"['gave', 'two', 'stars', 'movie', 'exactly', 'two', 'benefits', 'gained', 'watching', 'benefits', 'are', 'illustrated', 'next', 'two', 'absolutely', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'Depictions', 'Provence', 'region', 'France', 'adjacent', 'Mediterranean', 'Sea', 'Italy', 'were', 'bountiful', 'beautiful', 'Director', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'showcasing', 'scenes', 'representing', 'Provence', 'enough', 'make', 'one', 'consider', 'clicking', 'complete', 'order', 'button', '14-day', 'European', 'vacation', 'extravaganza.That', 'little', 'tune', 'Alizee', 'Moi', 'Lolita', 'made', 'brief', 'appearance', 'movie', 'catapulted', 'song', 'back', 'consciousness', 'song', 'course', 'one', 'many', 'attempts', 'media', 'capitalize', 'cultural', 'sensation', 'Vladimir', 'Nabokov', 'controversial', 'novel', 'Lolita', 'story', 'entirely', '*plot', 'summation', 'information', 'below*The', 'essence', 'story', 'tired', 'clich', 'eacute', 'greedy', 'amoral', 'pig', 'finding', 'meaning', 'love', 'purpose', 'simple', 'equation', 'abandoned', 'family', 'estate', '+', 'attractive', 'native', 'love', 'interest', '+', 'beautiful', 'French', 'countryside', '=', 'happiness', 'Max', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'wildly', 'successful', 'unscrupulous', 'power', 'broker', 'who', 'never', 'met', 'market', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'manipulate', 'Following', 'particularly', 'successful', 'business', 'adventure', 'assistant', 'clues', 'possibility', 'risk', 'being', 'investigated', 'trade', 'regulatory', 'commission', 'partial', 'solution', 'superiors', 'recommend', 'take', 'temporary', 'leave', 'absence', 'company', 'preferably', 'country', 'heat', 'down', 'luck', 'would', 'have', 'Max', 'uncle', 'recently', 'died', 'Provence', 'left', 'will', 'winery', 'previously', 'care', 'automatically', 'bequeathed', 'Max', 'closest', 'known', 'relative', '*end', 'plot', 'summation', 'information*Many', 'have', 'complained', 'sheer', 'predictability', 'plot', 'definitely', 'negative', 'aspect', 'film', 'not', 'necessarily', 'terminal', 'one', 'What', 'did', 'kill', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'utterly', 'nonsensical', 'editing', 'Scenes', 'flash', 'semblance', 'explanation', 'Cut', 'conversation', 'seemingly', 'reason', 'explain', 'nothing', 'then', 'cut', 'do', 'next', 'scene', 'just', 'one', 'beginning', 'soak', 'up', 'scenery', 'Include', 'several', 'characters', 'scenes', 'actual', 'suggested', 'implied', 'reason', 'placement', 'there', 'Speed', 'up', 'action', 'one', 'two', 'semi-montage', 'scenes', 'vein', 'physical-comedy', 'film', 'pre-', 'post-scene', 'comedic', 'introduction', 'resolution', 'Finally', 'splice', 'post-', 'fin', 'scene', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'surreal.In', 'essence', 'movie', 'was', '200', 'mini-films', 'spliced', 'one', 'least', 'impression', 'got', 'totally', 'destroyed', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'are', 'other', 'negatives', 'lame', 'stereotyping', 'secretaries', 'Americans', 'European', 'humor', 'plots', 'go', 'nowhere', 'good', '/', 'bad', 'wine', 'secret', 'conspiracy', 'humor', 'attempts', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'labeled', 'wince-inducing', 'many', 'many', 'other', 'detrimental', 'attributes.Not', 'even', 'worth', 'renting', 'friend', 'already', 'rented', 'have', 'cleaned', 'gunk', 'could', 'reasonably', 'be', 'expected', 'clean', 'fingernails', 'already.Romantic', 'comedy', 'lovers', 'romantic', 'funny', 'so', 'just', 'HAVE', 'see', 'handsome', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'beautiful', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'buy', 'poster', 'instead', 'Gladiator', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'fans', 'even', 'breakneck', 'editing', 'still', 'not', 'action', 'movie.Scenery', 'fans', 'turn', 'off', 'audio', 'fast-forward', 'scenery', 'scenes', 'keep', 'Semillon', 'flowing', 'would', 'recommend', 'three', 'bottles', 'person']",N/A

1041834,A21G4TR1PBPS7H,B000LXHK22,Movie_Fan,"[34, 38]","""A Good Year"" deals with the story of Max (Crowe), a heartless guy who doesn't ""do weekends"" and has ""questionable"" work ethics (you could say), who goes back to France to his recently deceased uncle's vineyards in Provence in order to sell the property.  Of course the movie is completely predictable : he falls in love with the local georgeous girl (Marion Cotillard) and he changes back into this guy who loves life and is nice and all of that good stuff.  But don't hold that against the movie, because you'd then be missing out on a really good one.The movie's been described as ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" with a male lead, and I guess that's somewhat accurate but at the same time not really.  It does play the same stories what with getting situated in a beautiful environment, but the two lead characters in both movies are very different from one another.  Diane Lane's character just wanted to get away whereas Crowe's just wants to go back so it's not exactly the same situation.A lot of people criticize the fact that it's not Crowe's or Ridley Scott's best, and sometimes go to say it's their worst movie ever made.  I personally don't see it.  Coming into this movie you can't be waiting for something like ""The Gladiator"" because if that's the case you're in for 2 hours of boredom.  So ok, it's not the best movie ever made, but it's not one of the worst either.  Personally I'd say it's still above average, and considering some of the movies that have been coming out, it's almost like a little piece of paradise.  The movie takes its time getting to where it wants to go, taking the time to take in all the scenery and the people and just the whole charm of the environment we've been put in.  The acting is fine.  It's not Russell Crowe's best but it's not horrendous either and he's just fine in the role he's playing, even if I had a tough time warming up to the character (but isn't that the point?).  I'm a huge fan of Marion Cotillard so i'm biased but I thought she was great in the movie.  The rest of the cast does really well too even though the neighbor had a tendency to get on my nerves.On the whole, I thought it was a good movie, I really enjoyed it.  It's a nice break from action and political movies, and there's a couple of times where you can't help but laugh (the reference to Lance Armstrong, for example).

Ridley Scott doing comedy has a slightly forced feel to it, none more so than when he has Crowe doing slapstick.  The scene with Crowe trying to get out of the pool goes on for just a bit too long to be comfortable, and watching Crowe falling about in the mud is somehow just not funny.  In addition, the plotline is slight, with the outcome never really in doubt.Having said that, the screenplay has a lightness to the script which brings at the very least a smile - this may not be out and out comedy, but it is lighthearted enough to be entertaining.  The characters all have a touch of reality in an exaggerated form, which grounds the movie, albeit through a rosy lens filtered romantic haze.  If you are willing to just go with the flow, enjoy the scenery, the gorgeous cast and the languid pace, then you will be well enough rewarded with a lingering smile at the end.This is really a 3 star movie, just elevated to 4 stars by a combination of Scott's lushly photographed scenery, and the charming flashbacks with Albert Finney as the uncle and Freddie Highmore (Charlie and the chocolate factory, Finding Neverland) as the young Max Skinner.A Good Year won't be bothering Oscar any time soon and won't remain on anyone's top ten list - but it's a surprisingly effective change of pace for Scott and Crowe.",3,"Surprisingly enjoyable diversion into wine, women and gorgeously shot scenery",1186358400,"08 6, 2007",2007,1627,"['story', 'callous', 'irredeemably', 'nasty', 'market', 'trader', 'who', 'go', 'Provence', 'take', 'care', 'late', 'Uncle', 'Estate', 'change', 'pace', 'gradually', 'exterior.It', 'not', 'most', 'original', 'storylines', 'unlikely', 'hands', 'form', 'Ridley', 'Epic', 'Scott', 'Russell', 'Imposing', 'Crowe', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'doing', 'comedy', 'slightly', 'forced', 'feel', 'none', 'more', 'so', 'when', 'Crowe', 'doing', 'slapstick', 'scene', 'Crowe', 'trying', 'get', 'pool', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'be', 'comfortable', 'watching', 'Crowe', 'falling', 'about', 'mud', 'somehow', 'just', 'not', 'funny', 'addition', 'plotline', 'slight', 'outcome', 'never', 'really', 'doubt.Having', 'said', 'screenplay', 'lightness', 'script', 'very', 'least', 'smile', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'out', 'comedy', 'lighthearted', 'enough', 'be', 'entertaining', 'characters', 'have', 'touch', 'reality', 'exaggerated', 'form', 'movie', 'rosy', 'lens', 'filtered', 'romantic', 'haze', 'are', 'willing', 'just', 'go', 'flow', 'enjoy', 'scenery', 'gorgeous', 'cast', 'languid', 'pace', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'well', 'enough', 'rewarded', 'lingering', 'smile', 'end.This', 'really', '3', 'star', 'movie', 'just', 'elevated', '4', 'stars', 'combination', 'Scott', 'lushly', 'photographed', 'scenery', 'charming', 'flashbacks', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'uncle', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'Charlie', 'chocolate', 'factory', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'young', 'Max', 'Skinner.A', 'Good', 'Year', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'bothering', 'Oscar', 'time', 'soon', 'wo', ""n't"", 'remain', 'anyone', 'top', 'ten', 'list', 'surprisingly', 'effective', 'change', 'pace', 'Scott', 'Crowe']",N/A

Max is focused only on generating profits, and he has no personal relationships in his life to speak of. After a bumper business day (involving ethically questionable behaviors), Max comes home to find a letter notifying him that his Uncle Henry (Albert Finney), who he used to spend his summers with, has died. Because Henry left no formal written will, and because Max is his only living relative, all of Henry's possessions (which include a sizable estate and vineyard in Provence) go to Max. Max packs up his bags and heads to Provence to do a quick assessment of the estate and prepare it for sale.Of course, once Max arrives in France, Provence (and a lovely lady, played by Marion Cotillard) sinks into his bones. In addition, the vineyard jumpstarts Max's memory, invoking all the grand adventures he had on the estate with Uncle Henry. (Freddie Highmore plays Max as a child.) Lastly, an attractive American shows up, claiming to be Uncle Henry's illegitimate daughter (complicating decisions about the estate).My favorite parts of the movie were the flashbacks of Max as a child at the vineyard. Highmore and Finney had a nice on-screen relationship, and the golden-tinted light had just the right hazy, halcyon quality to evoke memory.Overall, however, the movie had a really predictable storyline and smacked of a French version of Under the Tuscan Sun.

But to my surprise this is definitely a Ridley Scott production.  There aren't any big battles or extravagant costumes.  This is plain and simple romance, further enhanced by the beautiful scenery but it is predictable as most romantic comedies are.  This is a genre I wasn't expecting from Scott, but he did a great job.  The cinematography was great as were the actors and script.  There were some funny moments but lacked any deep emotional scenes.  It really is a basic ""safe"" romantic comedy.The second thing that caught my eye was the fact it stared Russell Crow.  The bad boy of the outback playing a ""know-it-all"" stock broker from London who gets wooed into the wine maker lifestyle.  Crow did a wonderful job and I was pleasantly surprised by his range here.  His portrayal of snobby money maker turned humbled wine maker was fun to watch.  It seemed like he was having fun with the role and that showed in his performance.  The stunning Marion Cotillard plays Crow's love interest and she is as beautiful as ever.  How could you not want to stay in France with a dame like that by your side?My favorite thing about this film and production was the music.  The soundtrack was a home run, including tracks from Josephine Baker, Franz Ferdinand and The Everly Brothers.  Sadly, the official soundtrack CD is missing some of the best songs from the movie.  I thoroughly enjoyed the French music as well and they were all partnered perfectly with the situations playing on screen.""A Good Year"", as I said before, is simple.  There is no complexity to the story, it is straight forward and doesn't pretend to be anything it is not.  For me, I like films with more depth, but for what it was I enjoyed this movie.

What to do...what to do. Sell this old house of course a.s.a.p. and get back to the business of the day. But, that empty pool in back, with the bottom covered in soil was the same pool young Max would impress his uncle with a swan dive. That unused tennis court with the sagging net......the same court Uncle Henry would explain to the young frustrated mind of Max that losing should be as graceful as winning. And what to do with the vinyard, his uncle's passion maintained by the loyal Duflot who has been singing to the vines these many years. Warm memories, one by one come creeping back as Max's week-long stay at the old house turns into much more. Max runs into a local woman who he thinks he remembers from his boyhood summers? Max's blackberry is constantly vibrating courtesy of Gemma, Max's secretary played by Archie Panjabi with expert comic timing holding down the fort back in London(""mission control"") and reminding him of the urgency of his returning presence. A heartfelt plea fromDuflot for Max to reconsider selling the beloved estate and winery to nameless buyers. Tiny TaTi scampering inbetween everybody's feet. And a young woman, from America, arriving one day to find her father, Uncle Henry is no longer part of her life. All of this must Max juggle. This film is pure delight with ample amounts of humor mixed with thoughtful reflection and love. A wonderful wonderful movie and let's not forget the soundtrack....hearing Hey Joe sung in French completely blindsided me and the couple of songs sung by Harry Nilsson came out of left-field as well.....a smooth big band jazzy swing number played in one scene as Max sits at the desk writing was wonderful.

Marvellous story, sharp and witty script, fluid movement, a romp from one end to the other. Most wonderful of all was Crowe who mixed the hard nosed investment fast lane type with a man coming to grips with life's real values so well, I wanted the movie to keep on and on and show us more how he settled into his paradise in the Louberon.All the supporting players were wonderful, but above all, I loved the cutbacks to Finney and the insights of how the boy became the man.

For the Francophiles, this is an unmissable experience and something to be savoured on the big screen.  It's plain obvious that this is a labour of love for Ridley Scott, the Director who owns a property himself at Provence.  Much efforts have been put in to get the right colour hues to complement the story and the domestic scenes captured on film is simply magical.  There's quite a bit of witty British dry jokes that are coming on and retro British songs from the olden years somehow fit into this movie brilliantly.  Unlike Diane Lane's Under the Tuscan Sun which is a bit forced, one word to describe this one is simply, ""Charming"".  Much criticism has been laid on Russell Crowes by critics and even viewers alike but personally, I think he's doing a wonderful job playing a character who has over the years lost his soul but inevitably redeeming it back in the end.  Overall, this movie is about love, life, friendship, wine, memory & Provence.  It would be appropriate to define this as Ridley Scott's homage or love letter to the land that he loves.

1041852,A2FUOXFJ74B32M,B000LXHK22,"P.K. Ryan ""The Ryan Identity""","[7, 7]","This was a cute little romantic comedy set in beautiful Provence, France. The story follows a selfish and callous London stockbroker who inherits his deceased Uncle's vineyard. He has every intention to quickly unload the burdensome property for the largest profit possible, yet when he returns to this place of his childhood summers, it grabs a hold of him. There seems to be something magical about this place and it comes through clearly in this visually stunning film. Along with this magnetic setting, he also happens upon a charming and lovely young lady in the way of Marion Cotillard, the combination of which compels him to have a sincere change of heart. Throw in a newly discovered American cousin and the goofy French couple who take care of the estate and you have an entertaining little story.This tag team of Cotillard and French countryside is what really drew me in. I can't decide which one is more lovely, but I think you'd be hard-pressed to find a right-minded man who could resist the combination. Apparently, Russell Crowe was the star of this film but I didn't even notice, entranced as I was with the aforementioned duo. OK, I kid. You can hardly miss Crowe who is the main protagonist, and I think he does a good job in this brief departure from his usual role as a tough guy. I was also surprised to see that Ridley Scott was the director, as I am used to seeing him involved strictly in action-packed blockbuster type films.Some reviewers have said that if you love wine and France, you will love this movie. While this is probably true, I'm not into wine, and I've never been to France, yet I still found this to be an enchanting little film. Frankly, the story is a bit cliched, and there is nothing really original or earth-shattering here, but I found myself enjoying it nonetheless. A nice, pleasant movie to enjoy with your sweetheart, or just your lonely self.

After all, Crowe's superficial charm winning over the smart, sexy, unobtainable woman was not really grounded in any convincing moves or even modification in his demeanor. No greater truth was reached. The plot revolving around the girl who was supposedly heiress to the land was irritating, and again no knowledge was gained (beyond all doubt, at least) before the resolution is reached. So, I look at it as that, a simple movie to watch when one doesn't feel like thinking. As such, there is a single moment I considered mildly entertaining, which was the expulsion of the Americans from the restaurant after they verbally defiled the menu... yes, Americans are slobs without any appreciation for the sublime... that's been established.

The main theme falls within the lines of looking back and looking forward, and has viewers watching how fast-paced stock broker executive, Max Skinner, (Russell Crowe)changes to a guy who actually has a heart.  However, it takes the death of his Uncle Henry (Albert Finney)the discovery of an American cousin, Christie Roberts (Abbie Cornish), and a sudden eye for a childhood memory, Fanny Chenal (Marion Cotillard), to change his ways.A GOOD YEAR is a nostalgic film.  The soundtrack is filled with an array of nostalgic 1970s flavor tunes by Harry Nilsson, which accompanies Max's childhood flashbacks, such playing chess with Uncle Henry while sharing a glass of wine, dives into the garden pool, and playing cricket inside the Chateau.  Ridley Scott does a fine job depicting Max's youth and the close relationship with his uncle.  A nice treat to the film, if one watches closely, is the scene where Fanny and Max go on an evening excursion.  They watch a collage of classic French Cinema flash on the movie screen, which shows the legendary work of renowned French actors of French comedy and film, such as Jacques Tati and a host of others.A GOOD YEAR has a combination of comedy and light drama.

1041860,A9MOZDD4DO6FY,B000LXHK22,"Robert M. Penna ""Dr. Bob""","[2, 4]","About 18 months ago, in my review of Peter Mayle's ""A Good Year,"" I likened the book to a helping of cotton candy, a silly confection that may satisfy a temporary sweet tooth, but cannot satisfy a real appetite.  It was with no small trepidation, therefore, that I sat down to watch the film version directed in 2006 by Ridley Scott.One hundred and twenty minutes later, I was not sure what I watched....I know only that it was NOT Mayle's ""Good Year.""Oh, yes...the title was the same, the setting was the same and the main character, Max Skinner, had the same name.  But that was where any similarities between Mayle's original and Marc Klein's screenplay largely ended.In Mayle's original, Max finds himself improbably cheated out of his livelihood at lunch, and inheriting an estate by dinner time.  His career for the moment shot, Max has nothing to keep him from the splendors and adventures waiting in France.  The Klein screenplay, by contrast, has Skinner at the top of his professional form, albeit under a small but worrisome cloud: France, the estate and the circumstances of his inheritance are a bother, and this Skinner fully intends to make short work of them.  What follows is a standard boy-meets-girl tale, told against a larger story of self discovery.  Klein begins where Mayle began, and ends up in roughly the same place...but the path he takes to that end point is vastly and significantly different that the one taken by Mayle.The concept of screenplay and source material differing, even differing greatly, is certainly nothing new.  The problem here, however, is that Klein added nothing appreciably better.  Where the tension in Mayle's original came from a half-baked mystery he attempted to establish (before apparently losing interest and simply wrapping the whole thing up), the tension in Klein's version comes from Max's flashbacks to the time he spent under the tutelage of his dear, departed Uncle Henry....visions which call into stark contrast the man his uncle intended for him to become, and the man he in fact became.  Unfortunately choosing spend time recreating odd bits of Mayle's original storyline, Klein never gets the chance to fully develop the thread of Max's catharsis.  The change of heart he undergoes apparently comes as easily as everything else in his uniquely charmed life.The mediocre screenplay aside, the acting is generally first rate.  Russell Crowe has a romp playing a character who, had he been filmed fifty years earlier, would have almost certainly been played by Cary Grant.  Albert Finney has a similarly grand time playing the dear departed Uncle Henry, irascible, sly and all-knowing.  Unfortunately, Marion Cotillard, cast as Max's love interest, and Didier Bourdon, and Isabelle Candelier, the estate's husband and wife caretakers, get far too little screen time given the performances they turn in.  Among the few annoying cast notes is Freddie Highmore, as the young Max of the flashbacks, once again cast as one of those wise-beyond-his-years screen kids no one has ever actually met in real life.In the end, this film is no worse than the flawed book upon which it is loosely based, and may actually be a bit better.  Both are meaningless confections; but, as opposed to the book, the film takes only two hours to digest.",3,Different spin; same result,1180396800,"05 29, 2007",2007,3297,"['18', 'months', 'ago', 'review', 'Peter', 'Mayle', 'A', 'Good', 'Year', 'likened', 'book', 'helping', 'cotton', 'candy', 'silly', 'confection', 'may', 'satisfy', 'temporary', 'sweet', 'tooth', 'can', 'not', 'satisfy', 'real', 'appetite', 'was', 'small', 'trepidation', 'therefore', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'film', 'version', 'directed', '2006', 'Ridley', 'Scott.One', 'hundred', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'later', 'was', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'watched', '.I', 'know', 'only', 'was', 'NOT', 'Mayle', 'Good', 'Year', 'Oh', 'yes', 'title', 'was', 'same', 'setting', 'was', 'same', 'main', 'character', 'Max', 'Skinner', 'had', 'same', 'name', 'was', 'where', 'similarities', 'Mayle', 'original', 'Marc', 'Klein', 'screenplay', 'largely', 'ended.In', 'Mayle', 'original', 'Max', 'improbably', 'cheated', 'livelihood', 'lunch', 'inheriting', 'estate', 'dinner', 'time', 'career', 'moment', 'shot', 'Max', 'nothing', 'keep', 'splendors', 'adventures', 'waiting', 'France', 'Klein', 'screenplay', 'contrast', 'Skinner', 'top', 'professional', 'form', 'small', 'worrisome', 'cloud', 'France', 'estate', 'circumstances', 'inheritance', 'are', 'bother', 'Skinner', 'fully', 'make', 'short', 'work', 'What', 'standard', 'boy-meets-girl', 'tale', 'told', 'larger', 'story', 'self', 'discovery', 'Klein', 'where', 'Mayle', 'began', 'up', 'roughly', 'same', 'place', 'path', 'end', 'point', 'vastly', 'significantly', 'different', 'one', 'taken', 'Mayle.The', 'concept', 'screenplay', 'source', 'material', 'differing', 'even', 'differing', 'greatly', 'certainly', 'nothing', 'new', 'problem', 'here', 'however', 'Klein', 'added', 'nothing', 'appreciably', 'better', 'Where', 'tension', 'Mayle', 'original', 'came', 'half-baked', 'mystery', 'attempted', 'establish', 'apparently', 'losing', 'interest', 'simply', 'wrapping', 'whole', 'thing', 'up', 'tension', 'Klein', 'version', 'Max', 'flashbacks', 'time', 'spent', 'tutelage', 'dear', 'departed', 'Uncle', 'Henry', '.visions', 'call', 'stark', 'contrast', 'man', 'uncle', 'intended', 'become', 'man', 'fact', 'became', 'Unfortunately', 'choosing', 'spend', 'time', 'recreating', 'odd', 'bits', 'Mayle', 'original', 'storyline', 'Klein', 'never', 'chance', 'fully', 'develop', 'thread', 'Max', 'catharsis', 'change', 'heart', 'apparently', 'as', 'easily', 'everything', 'else', 'uniquely', 'charmed', 'life.The', 'mediocre', 'screenplay', 'aside', 'acting', 'generally', 'first', 'rate', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'romp', 'playing', 'character', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'filmed', 'fifty', 'years', 'earlier', 'would', 'have', 'almost', 'certainly', 'been', 'played', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'similarly', 'grand', 'time', 'playing', 'dear', 'departed', 'Uncle', 'Henry', 'irascible', 'sly', 'all-knowing', 'Unfortunately', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'cast', 'Max', 'love', 'interest', 'Didier', 'Bourdon', 'Isabelle', 'Candelier', 'estate', 'husband', 'wife', 'caretakers', 'get', 'far', 'too', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'given', 'performances', 'turn', 'few', 'annoying', 'cast', 'notes', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'young', 'Max', 'flashbacks', 'once', 'again', 'cast', 'one', 'wise-beyond-his-years', 'screen', 'kids', 'one', 'ever', 'actually', 'met', 'real', 'life.In', 'end', 'film', 'worse', 'flawed', 'book', 'loosely', 'based', 'may', 'actually', 'be', 'bit', 'better', 'are', 'meaningless', 'confections', 'opposed', 'book', 'film', 'only', 'two', 'hours', 'digest']",N/A

It really focuses on about a weeks worth of activities in a run-down French vineyard estate.  Max Skinner (Russell Crowe), a ""take no prisoners"" bond trader, inherits a French vineyard.  Coming off a deal that profited his company by $77 million, he had to cut his celebration short in order to sign some papers in France giving him the title to this property (that he only wanted to sell, sell, sell).[Note:  For an executive who believed that time was money, why didn't he send a lawyer in his stead?  It's done all the time.]Of course, he finds dirt, real people, and the meaning of life, the universe, and everything.Russell Crowe plays a great amateur ""gentleman farmer.""

Comedy timing can't be taught and Crowe does not have IT.I lasted the first 20 minute then got completely exhausted watching the machine gun editing and run-around- the- actor in circles camera work at Crowe's character's finance office.Then they actually put Crowe into a Mr. Bean-like car and sent him into the countryside to see the glorious winery. That was the only reason I stuck with pretty much the whole movie, although the middle sagged and I went to another channel for a while. It was hard to see the estate as Scott started filming the place like a TV commercial: rapid editings that continued while 2 characters would stand and talk. My eyes were kept so busy they got very tired.First there is the ""cute meet"" where Crowe runs a pretty, but boring, Italian or French girl off the road. Then Crowe falls into an empty swimming pool and oh, my, it was embarrassing watching him try to be Peter Sellers or Mr. Bean trying to get out of the pool.

Henry is a wine mentor and life lesson teacher to young Max, who eventually grows up to be a cold, no-nonsense stockbroker (Crowe) that hasn't had time for Henry in over 10 years. Max receives a telegram telling him that Henry passed away and although he had no will, the entire vineyard estate is being left to Max. Max has to travel to France, right after a taboo move he made in the stockmarket puts him under investigation. Once in France, he is reaquainted with the vineyard's overseer and his wife, and has a near accident with a gorgeous woman on a bicycle named Fanny (Marion Cotillard). Once Max gets to see and know Fanny, he becomes smitten. Add to this all the memories of summers with Henry that are triggered from seeing different areas of the grounds (the tennis court, a table with a dirty wine glass and one of Henry's old cigar butts still in the ashtray), and Max becomes more confused as to whether or not he really wants to sell the estate as originally planned. When Henry's illegitimate daughter shows up, more confusion is thrown into the mix. And of course, there's still the investigation business Max is under that his personal assitant Gemma (Archie Panjabi)continually calls him about, urging him to fly back home to sort out before he's in real trouble. Can Max sell his Uncle's legacy to the highest bidder and return to London, leaving behind the woman he finds ""intoxicating""? What will happen to Henry's daughter Christy? And who knew a box of lavender will keep scorpions from entering through an open window?""A Good Year"" is a wonderful story told by author Peter Mayle (""A Year in Provence"") brought to life on the big screen.

Sad to say some unneeded `bad' language, a little sex - no nudity.  The moral of this story is so well taught -  the values that come through in the end are life-changing - beautifully spread out before your eyes . . . almost like a fan.  Memorable. There is much to learn and take home in A Good Year. The lessons learned are great for all ages - seldom done this well.Set in a vineyard in the south of France - Provence - wonderful setting (of course, you will want to buy a vineyard and live in France!) Beautifully done, clever script and the best flashbacks I have ever seen. The film score is brilliant - even if you don't like ALL of the music you will buy the CD. You will find it grows on you!  The music is actually amazing!The clothes are wonderful - you will totally love the way Russell (Maxmillian) wears his Uncle's old collection of clothes - they do not fit at all but are reminiscent of boys wearing their grandfather's old clothing. It is amost a missed part of the story to many, I suppose.  Watch for the clothing!  Someone genius worked hard to make them a part of the story.Again, I loved the flashbacks and you can see Russell Crowe's great sensitivity - which he always does so well - almost childlike in so many scenes - as he begins to discover WHO he really is and, better yet,  why he is, WHO he really is.The supporting cast is wonderful - Albert Finney is a walk-a-way star in this beautiful film, not surprising! The younger boy, Max as a child, IS Max as a child.  Max even recognizes himself!  You will know for certain the boy is Russell Crowe as a young boy. The women are all lovely, very French and gorgeously charming!The best part of the film (for me) is that the plot thickens - rather than weakens - throughout the movie - to the very end. I always like that - knowing that it can't end bad - it just can't - please don't end bad - but for a brief moment you really think there might not be a Camelot.There is not much Russell Crowe does in real life that pleasures me but his acting is always excellent. Too bad he doesn't imitate the men he plays in the films. I have now watched it three times and watched the playbacks once - all the way through.

1041881,ALG7QH2L5JL2L,B000LXHK22,"T. Noever ""Author of the TETHYS series""","[6, 7]","This is one of those movies where Ridley Scott is in a mellow mood; and--despite my often-stated admiration for the man--this is yet another bit of proof, if any such were needed, that the man is a hopeless romantic. Though it's been said, and will be said again, that the 'real' main character of the movie is the Provencal, I can't see it. Ever since The Duellists, his first feature film, Scott has paid close attention to 'setting' as a creator of mood, sometimes with a painstaking and exquisite artistry that has few peers in the movie universe. Just because he does this, does not imply that the backdrop is what the flick is 'all about'. It's just the typical Ridley Scott care and attention lavished on the details of visuals and their importance. Still, as always, at the center are the characters.A Good Year is almost free of serious 'conflict'; and its rhythms, pacing and story-development goes against just about everything the gurus of screenwriting will preach. But is is seriously filled with choices, decisions and how we must needs live with them and their consequences. About how we drift into all sorts of directions because of who and what we are--and how maybe that's not what we really wanted, even though we turned out to be good and successful at it--and how, while still remaining essentially true to oneself and quite without needing to undergo terrible soul-searching and upheavals or even a 'change of character', it is possible to figure out better ways of using those same attributes to make decisions that are more mature, wise, authentic and ultimately fulfilling.Russel Crowe plays a role that must surely come naturally to him, and especially under the direction of someone he trusts. He is a rogue; a naughty boy--who always was a naughty boy, even in his young incarnation (played beautifully by Freddy Highmore), and lost his way for a while and forgot a lot of things. Fate intervenes and serves to remind him of stuff he'd closeted away; including, yes of course, 'the girl'. In the end, it's not about a matter of terrible situations and inescapable dilemmas, but about simple decisions about what matters and what doesn't and why--made by someone who has become wise/canny/mature enough to be able to tell the difference.Crowe obviously enjoys playing the naughty boy who enjoys being a naughty boy, and it comes across with a natural ease that makes him charming even when he addresses the underlings in his office as 'lab rats'. He's a rogue at the start and he's still a rogue at the end. You don't necessarily _have to_ change what you are, even if you're not perfect, in order to figure out what's what. And this 'what's what' is very much like Ridley Scott.I haven't read Peter Mayle's book, and have no need to. The movie itself is sufficient for me. As I expect from a RS flick, there's more subtle meaning, content and just sheer richness and substance in most scenes than other directors pack into their whole deep-and-meaningful movies.So, I'm a fan of Ridley Scott.

You don't find many surprises in the thin story of ""A Good Year"" which is shot against the background of beautiful scenery of Province, but probably you don't mind.Russell Crowe plays bespectacled Max, able but arrogant dealer, and Marion Cotillard plays Fanny, fiery but honest waitress. On the road Max nearly kills Fanny by his careless driving while Fanny in return fills the chateau's empty swimming pool where he is trapped with dirty water. It doesn't take much time for us (and them) to realize that they are made for each other and actually, they are. Crowe may not be the best choice for the role of Max, but still his acting itself is very good and so is Marion Cotillard, who was so memorable in French dark fantasy romance ""Love Me If You Dare"" as one of the most obstinate lovers in the movie history.Still somehow I didn't feel the film's story is told in a right way either as romance or comedy. To be a romance, ""A Good Year"" spends too little time on Fanny, whose character should be more fleshed out. To be a comedy (and it surely tries to be one), Ridley Scott's direction (with some references to Jacques Tati) falls flat. Good as he is, Russell Crowe is not M. Hulot whose silly pratfalls are amusing to see. Several episodes are repeated, about terrifying scorpion, about noisy car navigation system, about bicycle riders, but most of them miss the right timing.Another disappointing thing about ""A Good Year"" is its structure. The story is frequently interrupted by flashbacks which show us the relations between Max as little boy (Freddie Highmore) and his uncle (Albert Finney). Max's uncle and his secrets (about wine and women) play a pivotal role in the story, but for all the presence of veteran actor Finney, these flashback scenes fail to present him as interesting person as he should be.I truly admire his keen instinct for visuals and grand-scale fight scenes created in his works, but for me Ridley Scott is always a hit-and-miss director. I know ""A Good Year"" is a well-made light-weight romance and should be enjoyed as such, but I at the same time felt that the lightness (or shallowness, some might say) may not be his forte.",3,Russell Crowe and Ridley Scott in Light-Hearted Romantic Comedy,1187308800,"08 17, 2007",2007,2426,"['inherit', 'sell', 'off', 'recently-deceased', 'uncle', 'real', 'estate', 'including', 'small', 'vineyard', 'old', 'chateau', 'Max', 'Skinner', 'London-based', 'investment', 'broker', 'flies', 'Province', 'France', 'where', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'named', 'Fanny', 'new', 'meaning', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'many', 'surprises', 'thin', 'story', 'A', 'Good', 'Year', 'shot', 'background', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'Province', 'probably', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind.Russell', 'Crowe', 'plays', 'bespectacled', 'Max', 'able', 'arrogant', 'dealer', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'Fanny', 'fiery', 'honest', 'waitress', 'road', 'Max', 'nearly', 'Fanny', 'careless', 'driving', 'Fanny', 'return', 'chateau', 'empty', 'swimming', 'pool', 'where', 'trapped', 'dirty', 'water', ""n't"", 'take', 'much', 'time', 'realize', 'are', 'made', 'other', 'actually', 'are', 'Crowe', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'choice', 'role', 'Max', 'still', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'so', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'who', 'was', 'so', 'memorable', 'French', 'dark', 'fantasy', 'romance', 'Love', 'Me', 'Dare', 'one', 'most', 'obstinate', 'lovers', 'movie', 'history.Still', 'somehow', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'film', 'story', 'told', 'right', 'way', 'romance', 'comedy', 'be', 'romance', 'Good', 'Year', 'too', 'little', 'time', 'Fanny', 'character', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'fleshed', 'out', 'be', 'comedy', 'surely', 'be', 'one', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'direction', 'references', 'Jacques', 'Tati', 'flat', 'Good', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'not', 'M.', 'Hulot', 'silly', 'pratfalls', 'are', 'amusing', 'see', 'Several', 'episodes', 'are', 'repeated', 'terrifying', 'scorpion', 'about', 'noisy', 'car', 'navigation', 'system', 'bicycle', 'riders', 'most', 'miss', 'right', 'timing.Another', 'disappointing', 'thing', 'A', 'Good', 'Year', 'structure', 'story', 'frequently', 'interrupted', 'flashbacks', 'show', 'relations', 'Max', 'little', 'boy', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'uncle', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'Max', 'uncle', 'secrets', 'wine', 'women', 'play', 'pivotal', 'role', 'story', 'presence', 'veteran', 'actor', 'Finney', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'fail', 'present', 'interesting', 'person', 'should', 'be.I', 'truly', 'admire', 'keen', 'instinct', 'visuals', 'grand-scale', 'fight', 'scenes', 'created', 'works', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'always', 'hit-and-miss', 'director', 'know', 'Good', 'Year', 'well-made', 'light-weight', 'romance', 'should', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'such', 'same', 'time', 'felt', 'lightness', 'shallowness', 'might', 'say', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'forte']",N/A

1041890,A1C80B497LCYKA,B000LXHK22,"Waitsel Smith ""Movie Shark""","[6, 9]","Ridley Scott is an inconsistent director. He has had one overwhelming success (Gladiator), a few borderline successes (e.g., Black Hawk Down), and several cult successes (Alien and Thelma and Louise). The rest of his films, for the most part, have been disasters, including the now infamous Kingdom Of Heaven and the cult-film-wannabe Blade Runner. If you want to read everything that Ridley Scott is NOT, read his entry on Wikipedia.His decision-making in A GOOD YEAR is across the board. He shows brilliance in choosing cinematographer Phillippe Le Sourd, who won a Satellite Award for his vision of Provence in harvest season, with a gorgeous pallet of blues and oranges. But then he seems to have lost his mind in casting Russell Crowe in the lead, an extremely talented actor who has never shown any inclination toward comedy in any film he has ever done, and who, quite frankly, lacks the vulnerability and charm to pull it off. Crowe does his best to make self-absorbed stock trader Max Skinner interesting, but fails to make him funny even once, and pretty much fails to make him romantic, even though this is a romantic comedy.Again, Scott shows brilliance in choosing Marion Cotillard to play the love interest, Fanny Chenal; Abbie Cornish to play Christie Roberts, Max's only competition for his uncle's estate; Archie Panjabi to play Max's dry-witted assistant; Albert Finney to play Max's uncle; and Freddie Highmore to play the young Max Skinner. But then he makes strange choices in music that doesn't seem to fit the style of the film.With gorgeous photography, Russell Crowe's talent and an attractive location and cast, it's hard not to like this film. It's just hard to laugh and just as hard to get into the attempts at romance. There is very little at stake here, and so there is very little payoff. There is very little reason to care if Max makes the right choices. We care more for the women in the film than we do for Max. Do we really want to wish him on any of them? I guess scriptwriter Marc Klein, who based his screenplay on Peter Mayle's novel, could be blamed for this. But it's a lot more fun to blame Ridley Scott.Waitsel Smith",3,"BLAME RIDLEY SCOTT, NOT RUSSELL CROWE",1174694400,"03 24, 2007",2007,2161,"['Ridley', 'Scott', 'inconsistent', 'director', 'had', 'one', 'overwhelming', 'success', 'Gladiator', 'few', 'borderline', 'successes', 'e.g.', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'several', 'cult', 'successes', 'Alien', 'Thelma', 'Louise', 'rest', 'films', 'most', 'part', 'have', 'been', 'disasters', 'including', 'now', 'infamous', 'Kingdom', 'Heaven', 'cult-film-wannabe', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'want', 'read', 'everything', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'NOT', 'read', 'entry', 'Wikipedia.His', 'decision-making', 'A', 'GOOD', 'YEAR', 'board', 'brilliance', 'choosing', 'cinematographer', 'Phillippe', 'Le', 'Sourd', 'who', 'won', 'Satellite', 'Award', 'vision', 'Provence', 'harvest', 'season', 'gorgeous', 'pallet', 'blues', 'oranges', 'then', 'have', 'lost', 'mind', 'casting', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'lead', 'extremely', 'talented', 'actor', 'who', 'never', 'shown', 'inclination', 'comedy', 'film', 'ever', 'done', 'who', 'quite', 'frankly', 'vulnerability', 'charm', 'pull', 'off', 'Crowe', 'best', 'make', 'self-absorbed', 'stock', 'trader', 'Max', 'Skinner', 'interesting', 'make', 'funny', 'even', 'once', 'pretty', 'much', 'fails', 'make', 'romantic', 'even', 'romantic', 'comedy.Again', 'Scott', 'brilliance', 'choosing', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'play', 'love', 'interest', 'Fanny', 'Chenal', 'Abbie', 'Cornish', 'play', 'Christie', 'Roberts', 'Max', 'only', 'competition', 'uncle', 'estate', 'Archie', 'Panjabi', 'play', 'Max', 'dry-witted', 'assistant', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'play', 'Max', 'uncle', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'play', 'young', 'Max', 'Skinner', 'then', 'strange', 'choices', 'music', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fit', 'style', 'film.With', 'gorgeous', 'photography', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'talent', 'attractive', 'location', 'cast', 'hard', 'not', 'like', 'film', 'just', 'hard', 'laugh', 'just', 'as', 'hard', 'get', 'attempts', 'romance', 'very', 'little', 'stake', 'here', 'so', 'very', 'little', 'payoff', 'very', 'little', 'reason', 'care', 'Max', 'right', 'choices', 'care', 'more', 'women', 'film', 'do', 'Max', 'Do', 'really', 'want', 'wish', 'guess', 'scriptwriter', 'Marc', 'Klein', 'who', 'based', 'screenplay', 'Peter', 'Mayle', 'novel', 'could', 'be', 'blamed', 'lot', 'more', 'fun', 'blame', 'Ridley', 'Scott.Waitsel', 'Smith']",N/A
