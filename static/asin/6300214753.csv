However, not everyone may be happy with what the Blu edition has to offer so, let's discuss it.The Blu treatment of the the picture makes it slightly better than the DVD edition but only slightly - nothing like the older James Bonds or the 2001 on Blu. The Dolby TrueHD 5.1 probably is a more significant improvement than the upgraded image. It it convincingly superior to the DVD edition. In addition, there are Dolby 2.0 soundtracks in French and Spanish and subtitles are available if needed.When it comes to bonus features, this edition actually lacks the director's commentary soundtrack - don't understand why. The 'extras' seem to be those found on the previous DVD release:- Getting the class together - cast members talk about their experience- The making of... - everybody gets to talk- Who is Ferris Bueller - more analysis- The world according to Ben Stein - Ben is himself, again- Vintage Ferris Bueller, the lost tape - very funny actually, includes a very young Matthew Broderick interviewing the other cast members- Class Album - a collection of stillsWith the exception of the Class Album photos which got the HD treatment, all other bonus features were shot in low-def and narrow screen (also known as 'full screen').I would say that this should be a definite buy for a 'first time' Ferris Bueller enthusiast. For those who already have the movie on DVD... I don't regret making the purchase but the buying decision should be made with the awareness that this is not a giant leap forward in quality or viewing experience.

215138,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6300214753,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","In 1985 (the year I was born people!) a certain movie was released that ultimately became a phenomenon.  It has been labeled the movie of the 80's; the poster child for teen films everywhere.  It is lauded by many and sparked a generation of look-alikes that are still being churned out even today.  That movie is `The Breakfast Club'.I hate that movie.The following year the same writer/director behind the overrated slosh known as `The Breakfast Club' wrote and directed `Ferris Bueller's Day Off', yet another film that has been labeled a film of a decade.  This time though, John Hughes hit it out of the park.  There is no `corn' factor that was so prevalent in `The Breakfast Club'.  Sure, there is dancing and obvious 80's flare, but this is a teen movie that can still hold up today alongside modern teen movies.  I don't quite understand all of the reviewers stating that it won't appeal or relate to kids today, because to me it most certainly does, and I'm a 90's child when you think about it.The film revolves around Ferris, a typical high school kid who just wants to have a good time.  He fakes sick so that he can stay home from school.  They he convinces his best friend Cameron (who is actually sick) to help him break his girlfriend Sloane out of school so that they can spend the day joyriding in Cameron's father's sports car.The film is just a whole lot of fun.More than mere fun though, `Ferris Bueller's Day Off' broaches some of the same object lessons promoted in `The Breakfast Club' (such as parental failings) with a little more subtlety and a lot more character.  A scene where they mimic `The Graduate' is a splendid example of them tapping into the root message of the film without overdoing it.The point being that this film is deep yet still manages to hold onto the fun.Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of Matthew Broderick.  I find him rather dull and boring.  That said, he is Oscar worthy here.  He gives what may be the definitive `teen' performance.  He grapples the humor as well as the dramatic importance of his character and he possesses a flare and natural charisma that I never knew he ever possessed.  As great as he is, Jennifer Grey is even better as his devilishly jealous sister Jeanie.  Jeffrey Jones is quite good as the principle set out on disciplining Ferris and both Alan Ruck and the beautiful Mia Sara splendidly complement Broderick's every move.In the end I highly recommend this film, for it is a little slice of cinematic heaven.  It is funny, witty, charming and smart; all around creating a genuinely enjoyable and memorable movie experience.

215142,AK6UVFSU07NXH,6300214753,Anthony Hinde,"[1, 2]","Possibly the most fun you can have whilst sitting down, Ferris Bueller's Day Off is brilliant. Ferris is the ultimate high school idol.  He is irreverent towards authority, has a gorgeous girl friend, both loves and  scams his parents, has a not so friendly rivalry with the principal and  manages to maintain a philosophical detachment from the major crises that  make unwanted appearances in his life.As the title suggests the  story covers one day in the life of Ferris Bueller. Being a fine weather  day in Chicago, a fairly rare event in my experience, Ferris decides to  skip school. The trouble is that he has no car and thus needs his best  friend Cameron to pick him up. And what day off would be complete without  his girl by his side. The level of planning and immaculate execution  required to achieve these things sets an example for all of us. If he can  do all of this from within the restrictions of the school system, then what  limits do the rest of us really need to acknowledge.Once the  three main players are assembled we are treated to a wonderful tour of  Chicago. Though the stock exchange, art galleries, observation towers,  restaurants, baseball games and street parades, we get to experience it  all.

His delicious sense of humor is felt deeply in his legacy of comedy.I enjoy this film for its fun, its comedy, its music, its sense of grabbing life and living it. This is a fantasy, a perfect day in the life of a teenager in America. That's why we love it so. We want a day like this, we want to know wacky people like this.I love this film mostly for the hilarious performances of Jeffrey Jones and Edie McClurg: the pompous principal and his totally incapable, ditzy secretary.

This is, without a doubt, not only the quintessential John Hughes movie, but the quintessential high school/teen movie ever made. It was great back in 1986, and it's great today in 2001 because it's still real. Any kid at any given time in place can relate to this, and they will continue to do so far into the future. Matthew Broderick stars as Ferris Bueller. A sneaky, coniving high schooler(Broderick was 24 when he did this)who brilliantly pulls off being sick to miss a day of school. He also makes up excuses for his best friend Cameron(Alan Ruck), and his girlfriend Simone(Mia Sara). They get together and go off for a day of fun in Chicago in Cameron's father's fancy red car. Jennifer Grey(she of &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; fame)plays Ferris' evil sister who is hell bent on finding out he's playing hooky and destroying his life. A typical sister. The best is Jeffrey Jones as Principal Rooney. He is a man on a mission. He investigates Ferris and also tries to prove that he's lying. I, to this day, have never seen a principal so dedicated to his job. The great Edie McClurg plays his hilarious, ditzy secretary. The movie has very funny jokes and slapstick. The parade downtown with Ferris on the float singing &quot;Twist And Shout&quot; is a showstopper, and a memorable cinema scene. Broderick is good. He brings Ferris' cocky charm to life and makes it real. Grey is perfect as the sister from hell. This is the high school/teen movie to beat all other high school/teen movies. Be on the lookout for a young Charlie Sheen popping up too. Why doesn't everybody follow Ferris's lead and play hooky and go watch this movie!!!. Stay after the credits.

Edition (Special Collector's Edition)"" is, to me, the best choice. The price is incredibly reasonable, the bonus material that IS offered is fun, and if you want something to enjoy until the 'ultimate' one appears, I don't think you'll do better, truthfully!John Hughes was our generation's Preston Sturges; a brilliantly gifted screenwriter who revealed, as a director, a unique, original vision in a handful of film classics, then burned out, tragically, gradually fading from the scene. Where Sturges specialized in likable, working class characters in escalating, awkward situations, Hughes was the voice of the young, revealing their maturity, as well as angst, in a series of wonderful comedies set at key moments of their lives...and ""Ferris Bueller"" is one of the best. As portrayed by the perfectly-cast Matthew Broderick, in his breakthrough role, Bueller is the archetypical likable high school 'user', smarter than the rest of the world, but guileless, willing to share his 'grand vision' with those he cares about. Just a tad less gifted is his jealous younger sister (Jennifer Grey), who never seems to get the 'breaks' he enjoys, and, of course, the nemesis is the authority figure, the vice principal (Jeffrey Jones), furious that Bueller so effortlessly can twist the rules his way! The film splits into plotlines involving each character, as Bueller and his best friends (Mia Sara and Alan Ruck) enjoy the ultimate 'skip' day, his sister attempts to 'out' him to the parents, meeting bad boy Charlie Sheen in the process, and Jones, intending to publicly punish him, is inflicted with a never-ending series of slapstick disasters.

I was so thrilled to see that Paramount was giving this classic film an upgraded DVD Special Edition.  Upon seeing it however, I must say that I'm pretty disappointed.  The extras, although enjoyable, are sorely lacking what they could and SHOULD be.  Most of the film's major stars (and sometimes even minor ones like Kristy Swanson and Richard Edson) provide some updated interviews that are fun to watch.  But, the bonus material and interviews featuring Mia Sara are all from 1986!  She obviously CAN'T be that busy these days, so doesn't it make sense that an updated interview with her could have been included?Also, the shooting script for this movie contains MANY deleted scenes and dialogue, some of which were a GREAT read and are bound to have been filmed.  Ferris going through the house looking for money in some STRANGE places (all while the Pink Floyd tune ""Money"" was playing), as well as Cameron's dad seeing his 1961 Ferarri being driven through Chicago's streets by the two parking garage employees would have been GREAT to see.  However, the ONLY deleted scene we get here is a behind-the-scenes version of the waiter at Chez Qui telling the trio that the food they were eating was pancreas (which of course was referred to later by Ferris in the taxi).  No true special edition DVD should be without a deleted scenes section.  VERY disappointing.Next, this edition (like the original) does NOT include a theatrical trailer.  It's rare for even a bare bones DVD not to include at least one trailer, but nearly UNHEARD of for a special edition!  It's bound to still exist, and I can't beleive that it's THAT hard to find that they could not have dug it up for this ""special"" edition.Finally, the original DVD, while lacking a trailer, DID include a GREAT feature-length commentary track by writer/director John Hughes.  However, that commentary track is NOT included here!  That was either a severe oversight or a downright mean move by Paramount.  How hard would it have been to reproduce it here?  In effect, its omission forces anyone who bought the original DVD and wants to upgrade to the special edition to keep the original instead of selling or trading it, all because they want to retain the commentary.  Paramount should have at least made it possible that owning this new DVD would provide the most complete ""Ferris"" experience presently possible by itself, but without the original's commentary it doesn't.In summary, if you bought the original DVD, then I advise you to keep it and just rent this new version to give the special features a look.  Save the rest of what you would otherwise spend on this to put towards something more worthwhile.  If you have NOT bought the original DVD however, then this would be a worthwhile purchase to own the extras that were not present on the original.  But, do rent the original to give a listen to that AWESOME commentary track by John Hughes.",3,"Cough Cough Cough Cough Cough...Bleah, Bleah!

Ferris takes a day off from school and travels to nearby Chicago to spend a day with his friends and see the sights. He is faced with obstacles but remarkably can always overcome them. No one really knows a Ferris but we wish we could be like him. Ferris is played by the extremely talented and handsome Matthew Broderick (other work has included Glory, War Games, Election, You can Count on Me, and is currently starring in The Producers on Broadway) The movie also offers good performances from Alan Ruck (currently on Spin City) and Mia Sara. Jeffrey Jones is the pathetic principal who wants to catch Ferris breaking his rules by proving Ferris wasn't sick and instead skipping school. His bad luck and misfortune is completely opposite to Ferris's luck and confidence. The story is great and the cast is perfect. Overall this movie is entertaining and funny, mostly it deals with lighthearted themes but it does entertain some bigger ideas like living life in the present (&quot;Life goes pretty Fast, if you don't look around once in a while, you could miss it.&quot;) and the relationships of teenagedom (Cameron and his parents, the love between Sloane and Ferris, Ferris and his sister) The only criticism I have is the DVD doesn't include any interesting extras except for a commentary by John Hughes, the director.

Ferris can easily fool his parents (Cindy Pickett and Lyman Ward) into believing that he is really sick so he can stay home from school. But when his sister, Jeanie Bueller (Jennifer Grey) and school dean, Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones) find out that Ferris has cut school, they both try to make his life as miserable as possible in their own ways.

Director John Hughes did an amazing job, as usual. The script is well-written and extremely funny. &quot;Ferris Bueller&quot; is a classic high school film that everyone should own. However, the DVD lacks terribly; the only bonus feature is a commentary made by John Hughes.

215184,A3628L43ZVEMP5,6300214753,Christopher Twelvetrees,"[1, 1]","Though I am the same age as Matthew Broderick, it took me twenty-five years to see this movie (I had a phobia for John Hughes back in the '80s).  When I finally rolled around to it, taking a ""Bueller"" myself just to see it, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I thought it got bogged down in the third act, but it had a slam-bang finish and I gave it glowing reviews everywhere as a ""feel good"" movie.On a second viewing, about a year later, I was less impressed.  Parts of it are still ""feel good"" -- ""Twist and Shout"" for instance.  Yet, the second examination proved ""Bueller"" was less than the sum of its parts.The most vital part, of course, is Matthew Broderick.  I understand other names were mooted at the time, but Broderick's casting was essential.  Ferris is a total jerk.  He uses everyone, including his parents, friends, siblings, and even his girlfriend (risking getting her into trouble by kissing her inappropriately for certain circumstances).  The way he tricks people into doing his bidding may bode well for Ferris' future in the real world, but it makes him an unattractive character.  Matthew Broderick, on the other hand, can project, on film, an instant likability.  Few actors could have done what Broderick does.  In his better days, Michael J. Fox might have pulled it off.  John Cusack would have been too creepy, and Tom Cruise (another ""teen"" star of the time) might have been too phoney, like a used-car salesman's kid.  The lead role was extraordinarily well cast, and Broderick carries us through the movie, letting us see his side of things.But just remember:  Ferris is a suave liar able to charm everyone into doing his bidding.  So take what he says to you, the viewer, with a grain of salt.And he's so mollycoddled by his parents, how did Ferris get so adept at doing everything he does, rigging up dummies, etc?For the rest of the cast, Mia Sara is nearly as charming as Ferris, and is a little more believeable as a high schooler (Broderick is sometimes too wrinkled of forehead).  Ferris' friend, Cameron, on the other hand, is utterly annoying.  I had a Cameron of my own at one time, who seemed intent on not enjoying anything. I don't know why I hung around with him, and I can only imagine Ferris hangs around Cameron because he's easily deluded and comes from money.Ferris slickered me in the first viewing as he did everyone else, and I kept wishing I had been like him in high school.  On the second viewing, however, I kept thinking how awful his is to everyone, and I was glad I did not have a friend like him as well as one like Cameron.Jeffrey Jones, an excellent actor in projects as diverse as ""Amadeus"" and ""The Hunt for Red October,"" is a worthy opponent for Matthew Broderick's Ferris.  He is able to keep from being a hateful ogre, though we never feel sorry for when he loses, especially when he steps over the line and invades the Bueller household's privacy.As a movie, ""Ferris Bueller"" has great moments, and can raise a laugh at the sign on the water tower and the two guys who borrow the Ferrari.  And there are nice touches at the art museum, the Cubs game . . . the movie is full of brilliant moments.  Perhaps the best part is the constant threat that Ferris will be caught playing hookey, where he has so many near-misses with his father and Rooney it transcends the silliness of mere coincidence (culminating in the fact that his father actually sees Ferris running down the street and doesn't recognize him -- or blinds himself to it).I would still rank ""Ferris"" with the best of the ""80s"" teen comedies (alongside ""Better Off Dead"" and ""Heathers"").  But while Matthew Broderick's movie-charm shines through in every frame, Ferris' ""charm"" wore off quickly the second time around.  Someone ought to take Ferris down behind the gym and work him over, as many a better person has been (including me).",3,Not so Jolly the Second Time Around,1380844800,"10 4, 2013",2013,3859,"['am', 'same', 'age', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'took', 'twenty-five', 'years', 'see', 'movie', 'had', 'phobia', 'John', 'Hughes', 'back', ""'80s"", 'When', 'finally', 'rolled', 'taking', 'Bueller', 'just', 'see', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'thought', 'got', 'bogged', 'down', 'third', 'act', 'had', 'slam-bang', 'finish', 'gave', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'everywhere', 'feel', 'good', 'second', 'viewing', 'year', 'later', 'was', 'less', 'impressed', 'Parts', 'are', 'still', 'feel', 'good', 'Twist', 'Shout', 'instance', 'second', 'examination', 'proved', 'Bueller', 'was', 'less', 'sum', 'parts.The', 'most', 'vital', 'part', 'course', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'understand', 'other', 'names', 'were', 'mooted', 'time', 'Broderick', 'casting', 'was', 'essential', 'Ferris', 'total', 'jerk', 'everyone', 'including', 'parents', 'friends', 'siblings', 'even', 'girlfriend', 'risking', 'getting', 'trouble', 'kissing', 'inappropriately', 'certain', 'circumstances', 'way', 'people', 'doing', 'bidding', 'may', 'bode', 'well', 'Ferris', 'future', 'real', 'world', 'unattractive', 'character', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'other', 'hand', 'can', 'project', 'film', 'instant', 'likability', 'Few', 'actors', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'what', 'Broderick', 'better', 'days', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'might', 'have', 'pulled', 'off', 'John', 'Cusack', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'creepy', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'teen', 'star', 'time', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'phoney', 'used-car', 'salesman', 'kid', 'lead', 'role', 'was', 'extraordinarily', 'well', 'cast', 'Broderick', 'movie', 'letting', 'see', 'side', 'things.But', 'just', 'remember', 'Ferris', 'suave', 'liar', 'able', 'charm', 'everyone', 'doing', 'bidding', 'So', 'take', 'what', 'viewer', 'grain', 'salt.And', 'so', 'mollycoddled', 'parents', 'how', 'did', 'Ferris', 'get', 'so', 'adept', 'doing', 'everything', 'rigging', 'up', 'dummies', 'etc', 'rest', 'cast', 'Mia', 'Sara', 'nearly', 'as', 'charming', 'Ferris', 'little', 'more', 'believeable', 'high', 'schooler', 'Broderick', 'sometimes', 'too', 'wrinkled', 'forehead', 'Ferris', 'friend', 'Cameron', 'other', 'hand', 'utterly', 'annoying', 'had', 'Cameron', 'own', 'one', 'time', 'who', 'seemed', 'intent', 'not', 'enjoying', 'anything', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'hung', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'Ferris', 'hangs', 'Cameron', 'easily', 'deluded', 'money.Ferris', 'slickered', 'first', 'viewing', 'did', 'everyone', 'else', 'kept', 'wishing', 'had', 'been', 'high', 'school', 'second', 'viewing', 'however', 'kept', 'thinking', 'how', 'awful', 'everyone', 'was', 'glad', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'friend', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'Cameron.Jeffrey', 'Jones', 'excellent', 'actor', 'projects', 'as', 'diverse', 'Amadeus', 'Hunt', 'Red', 'October', 'worthy', 'opponent', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'Ferris', 'able', 'keep', 'being', 'hateful', 'ogre', 'never', 'feel', 'sorry', 'when', 'especially', 'when', 'line', 'Bueller', 'household', 'privacy.As', 'movie', 'Ferris', 'Bueller', 'great', 'moments', 'can', 'raise', 'laugh', 'sign', 'water', 'tower', 'two', 'guys', 'who', 'borrow', 'Ferrari', 'are', 'nice', 'touches', 'art', 'museum', 'Cubs', 'game', 'movie', 'full', 'brilliant', 'moments', 'Perhaps', 'best', 'part', 'constant', 'threat', 'Ferris', 'will', 'be', 'caught', 'playing', 'hookey', 'where', 'so', 'many', 'near-misses', 'father', 'Rooney', 'silliness', 'mere', 'coincidence', 'culminating', 'fact', 'father', 'actually', 'Ferris', 'running', 'down', 'street', ""n't"", 'recognize', '.I', 'would', 'still', 'rank', 'Ferris', 'best', '80s', 'teen', 'comedies', 'Better', 'Off', 'Dead', 'Heathers', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'movie-charm', 'shines', 'frame', 'Ferris', 'charm', 'wore', 'off', 'quickly', 'second', 'time', 'around', 'Someone', 'ought', 'take', 'Ferris', 'down', 'gym', 'work', 'over', 'many', 'better', 'person', 'been', 'including']",N/A

215191,AUHG8KSHI529U,6300214753,Craig Matteson,"[2, 3]","Everyone knows this movie.  At least that is what I thought until I realized that my fourteen year old son had not seen it.  So, we watched it together and, of course, it has the same issues of conformity, rules following, boredom, freedom, life, learning, and stupid power trips for him as it does for everyone.  A terrific movie that you should watch with any of your teenagers who haven't seen it.What brought it up was the insurance commercial with the guy playing as the Risk that Never Sleeps and I pointed out to my son, ""Hey, that's the guy from the parking garage in ""Ferris Bueller"".  ""What?"" he answered.  So, it was a must see.He loved the point about Cameron (indelibly played by Alan Ruck) being so tight that a lump of coal placed strategically in his anatomy could turn coal to diamond in a week.  Rooney being made the fool constantly is always enjoyable (perfectly played by Jeffrey Jones) and we enjoy seeing him get stuck in the mud, embarrassed, attacked by a dog, kicked in the face, and confronted with his wallet.  Edie McClurg as Grace is the PERFECT foil for Ed Rooney.  Who doesn't love her pulling pencil after pencil out of her teased up hair or the way she says ""righteous dude"".Of course, Ferris could be a monster if not played with just the right charm and lighthearted mischievousness that Matthew Broderick brings to the role.  If Ferris didn't actually care about other people and was only a sociopath it would be an awful story.  It really only works because Ferris is fooling parents who should have been paying closer attention, a sister who shouldn't be so uptight, a friend who is so miserable at home that trashing a rare Ferrari is the lesser crime, a principal who is vicious as well as stupid, and a headwaiter who is arrogant without any warrant to be so.  If all of these were caring and supportive people and Ferris was using them this way, well, he would be the bad guy.In any case, the movie is full of classic scenes, such as Ben Stein's calling roll and his little lecture on economics, the growth of the Save Ferris movement, Jennifer Grey's perfect performance as the steamed and jealous sister, and the performances mentioned above.  Mia Sara's performance as Sloane Peterson provides the one grounded and sane character in the whole movie.The extras on the disk I viewed were great (I assume there are various editions).  I learned lots of things about the making of the movie.  One of the interesting bits is that Cindy Pickett and Lyman Ward (the parents, Katie and Tom Bueller) became a couple because of these roles and are actually married.  Also, Ben Stein had a feature talking about life and how Ferris shows us about freedom and how Ferris Bueller changed his life.  One of the funny bits is when Ben explains how Richard Nixon is the reason he got the role in Ferris Bueller and is responsible for all the good things that have happened to him because of that role.

After viewing ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"", you may ask yourself ""Hmm...just exactly how was a cool, righteous dude such as Ferris Bueller able to pull his antics off, and without getting caught in the process?"" Such is a question which may come to mind, regardless of whether you're a teenager, or if you've left your teenage years long behind you.Ferris (Matthew Broderick) is one lucky kid who has it all: a pair of loving and understanding parents (played by Lyman Ward and Cindy Pickett), a beautiful and intelligent girlfriend named Sloane Peterson (played by Mia Sara), and, to top it all off, a bright and successful future ahead of him. But...something's missing...Although he's already missed nine days this school year, Ferris decides to undertake the most important ""Senior Skip Day"". In order to pull this feat off, Ferris enlists the help of his best friend Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck), who's home sick in bed. Together, they both cook up a scheme to get Ferris's girlfriend out of a boring history class, with both Ferris's school principal (Jeffrey Jones) and his sister Jeanie (Jennifer Grey) under heavy suspicion - both of whom are determined to catch Ferris with his pants down. While all this is happening, many comical moments occur in the unfolding, including a hilarious classroom scene with Ben Stein (in an early role) as a drone economics teacher (whom I personally would have loved to have had as an instructor during my high school years!), plus various other classic scenes and dialogue worthy of many a viewing.The secondary ""star"" of ""FBDO"", is a 1961 Ferrari GT, which gets quite a workout during much of the movie (although this big red machine's fate is a bit too much to mention). It's interesting to note that four Ferraris were used in the making of this outstanding motion picture.But, you may also ask yourself: ""How was it that Ferris & Co. were able to visit all those landmark places in Chicago all in one day?"" And what landmarks these venues are! First, our mischievous gang of merry gentlemen and one debonair lady take in the sights of our nation's third largest city high atop the tallest building in the world, the Sears Tower, then it's on to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange for an instant's insight into the trader's market, and on to a midday lunch break at a fancy French restaurant, where Ferris barely avoids meeting up with dear old Dad. After their midday respite, Ferris, Cameron and Sloane take in a Cubs game at historic Wrigley Field (before lights were installed for night games, a spectacle which truly made this ballpark a one-of-a-kind attraction, alongside its ivy-covered outfield walls). Finally, our gang pays a visit to the Art Institute of Chicago, where unique and stylistic works of physical, impressionistic structures await our unique band of ""tourists"".What occurs during and what follows this ""field trip"" is very pacey and classic comedy dialog, just like the outing around the city (including a must-see free-for-all ""concert"" and sing-along in one). Just watch Ferris's pursuing principal and his jealous sister TRY and catch him in the act. You'll ABSOLUTELY die laughing!""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" is another John Hughes written and directed masterpiece worthy of high praise. The master of teen flicks is clearly at the top of his game here. You DO NOT want to miss the closing credits as well.

The blu-ray version of Ferris Bueller's Day Off is an improvement upon the DVD.  Nicks, scratches, dirt and other ""artifacts"" have been removed.  The resolution is significantly improved.  The dialogue is clear, although a bit soft--I had to crank up the volume on my system in order to hear it.  The music sounded great, however.  There are some scenes that are dark, particularly in Ferris' bedroom early in the movie, but they were dark in the DVD too.  There is also some noticeable film grain in some interior scenes, although the outside scenes look great.  On the whole, the blu-ray version is better than the DVD.

215210,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,6300214753,Deborah Earle,"[2, 3]","This lively John Hughes offering from the summer of 1986 depicts a certain joyousness in watching a charmingly irritating Teflon truant from a well-to-do Chicago family play hooky from school in an incident that marks his ninth absence of the semester.A boyish looking Matthew Broderick, then in his twenties,pulls off the title character's part so skillfully that he makes detestable behavior amusing.We find this ""righteous dude""(school secretary Edie McClurg's Grace's notation of how Ferris is viewed by students) lying in bed one fine spring morning, deciding that he ""couldn't possibly handle school"" on such a day in one of many asides to an invisible audience, and tell his parents(Lyman Ward and Cindy Pickett)that he is ill in a dramatic performance that earns the ire of his sister, Jeanie(Jennifer Grey)who isn't buying it for a minute. His parents, unfortunately, can be conned so easily, it's pathetic!Once his family have left, Ferris steps up his plan to enjoy a day on the town with his frequently ill, insecure and hypochondriac friend, Cameron(Alan Ruck), the product of of a repressive and dysfunctional household whose materialistic off-screen father has incredibly skewered values, and his girlfriend, Sloane Peterson(Mia Sara). He calls Cameron, goes to his house and finnagles him into getting his father's classic red Ferrari out of the garage. Having made a few calls to Principal Rooney's (Jeffrey Jones) office, pretending to be her father and claiming that there has been a death in her family, he gets Sloane out of school,letting the Principal see him incognito and in stylish-looking car, and their illicit day of fun begins.They park the car in a city garage, leaving it in the hands of two attendants(Richard Edson and Larry Flash Jenkins) whose recklessly cavalier behavior could easily match Ferris' own.The school day finds an aggravated Jeanie being given condolences from schoolmates concerned about her brother's health(Ferris having spread the word among the underclass students who look up to him). Ferris has fiddled with the school computer to mark down his true number of absences, so Principal Rooney has to withdraw his complaint about his many absences to his mother during a phone call--one of many instances in which his authority will be undermined during the day.We see the classes Ferris is missing throughout the day, most notably the one taught by Ben Stein's deadpan Economics teacher.Among the places they visit is a swank restaurant, where the casually dressed trio are challenged by a stuffy Maitre D'(Jonathan Schmock), but are once again able to make an adult look like an idiot and get in. They are nearly spotted by Mr. Bueller,attending lunch there with his business partners, but somehow manage to avoid his detection even then.They travel to the top of the Sears Tower, attend a ball game, and spend time at the Art Institute of Chicago,where they link up with a class of Elementary School children on a field trip, all without anyone asking them why they aren't in school.--Perhaps it is presumed they too, are on a field trip, although there's less credibility  there without a larger class of students and a supervising teacher.A water tank reading ""Save Ferris"" further reveals how well the High-Schooler's ruse is succeeding.The two people who most want to see Ferris grilled for his offenses, Jeanie and Mr. Rooney gradually and unexpectedly gravitate toward each other at the Bueller home. The results will be that one will end up in trouble and one will ultimately have to concede defeat.Ferris' ruse reaches its climax when he slips on to a float at a downtown parade celebrating German heritage(Noticeably, he has an appropriate last name),pantomimes to Wayne Newton's ""Danke Schoen"", and leads everyone in rocking to the Beatles' rendition of ""Twist and Shout"". Even his father, back at work in a nearby office building is stirred by the sound.But if only he had gone to his window and looked down below...The film loses its verve after this point. But the afternoon finds the teenagers sneaking a romp in a neighbor's pool and jacuzzi, and finally back at Cameron's house to return the Ferrari to the garage in a scene where Cameron finally confronts his anger issues in an intense scene in which property is damaged.That, too, is the influence of Ferris Bueller.Distracted from work by a situation with Jeanie(during which the latter breifly encounters a young Charlie Sheen), Mrs. Bueller angrily drives home with the daughter that she and her husband believe to be the bad seed, and Mrs.Bueller narrowly misses seeing her purportedly ailing son land against her car just right in front of her as she is at a stop sign, as he rushes home from his day of illicit adventures.Mr. Rooney makes one final attempt to confront the Buellers at their home as all the main parties converge there, but an ironic twist that has always made me cringe when watching it results in his being repelled for the final time.Certain details, such as Rooney's wallet being left on the Bueller's kitchen floor, and their dog, who attacked Mr. Rooney, lying unconscious after having a ""Get Well Soon"" flower pot arrangement for Ferris dropped on him may later bring pause to Ferris' parents.But we don't see how Ferris may eventually pay for the trouble he causes. For him, the story ends on a note of impish triumph.",4,Playing Hooky in Plain Sight---And With Style!,1297296000,"02 10, 2011",2011,5373,"['lively', 'John', 'Hughes', 'offering', 'summer', '1986',

215211,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,6300214753,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[6, 8]","""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" was definitely a major hit from 1986.  I can remember everyone from high school just in love with the film and many people praising the latest hit from Director (and also writer) John Hughes who has directed many of the top teen hits in the 80's such as ""The Breakfast Club"", ""Pretty in Pink"" and ""Weird Science"".Needless to say, a film in the 80's that was attached to John Hughes was considered as golden and sure enough, ""FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF"" was as successful as his previous teen films (the film grossed over $70 million in the box office) and the film is considered (and voted) by many fans as one of the top comedy films of all time.VIDEO & AUDIO:""FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF"" is presented for the first time on Blu-ray and with a 1080p High Definition transfer.  The good news is that the picture quality is better than any previous release of the film. Colors are vibrant at times, but with the film nearly 25-years-old, for some reason I felt the video looked a bit soft.Certain scenes show sign of ages with a few spotting and again, video was looking a bit soft.  Having seen the two magnificently looking Paramount releases of ""Saturday Night Fever"" and ""GREASE"" on Blu-ray which comes out on the same day as ""FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF"", those films are 30-years old and look incredible and definitely look gorgeous on Blu-ray.  But for ""FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF"", it was a good transfer, but not magnificent.You do see a variety of cool colors such as the parade segment or even when the three are at the swimming pool, there is very good vibrancy of colors and part of the positive about this film is that a good chunk of the film is  filmed outdoors.  If anything, this transfer does look way better than its DVD counterpart.As for audio, ""FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF"" is a John Hughes film, similar to his other big hits, music plays a big part of his films.  And thus you can hear Yello's ""Oh, Yeah"" and the Beatles ""Twist and Shout"" in Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  The film is strong on the dialogue side and thus, the true usage of surround sound and when the film does come alive is during the scenes that showcase the music.Also featured is French 2.0 Dolby Surround and Spanish mono.  Subtitles include English, English SDH, French, Spanish and Portuguese.SPECIAL FEATURES:""FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF"" on Blu-ray is based on the special ""Bueller...Bueller...Edition"" DVD release and features the following in standard definition:* Getting the Class Together - The Cast of Ferris Bueller's Day Off - (27:45) Interviews with a few of the cast during the time the film was shot and also a few recent interviews as of 2005.  The casting directors selected Matthew Broderick because he was one of the top young stars of the time with films such as ""War Games"", Alan Ruck was supposed to be in the original ""The Breakfast Club"" but this time gave Ruck a chance in this film (which was turned down by Emilio Estevez).  Also, interesting tidbits such as the real life relationship between the two actors that play Ferris's parents.* The Making of Ferris Bueller's Day Off - (15:29) We learn about the filming of ""FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF"" from the various scouting locations, finding the right car (Ferrari) and how they were going to have it crash out from a window and more.* Who is Ferris Bueller? - (9:12) Interviews with Matthew Broderick and the mindset of Ferris Bueller and playing the role.* The World According to Ben Stein - (10:49) Ben Stein is interviewed in the past and the present.  Stein talks about how he was discovered from writing speeches for President Nixon and how he will forever be remembered for the two words...""Bueller...Bueller..."".* Vintage Ferris Bueller: The Lost Tapes - (10:51) Onset craziness with the three main talents.* Class Album - This features the still photography used for publicityOwners of the original DVD release may still want to keep it because the commentary by John Hughes from that version was never included in the ""Bueller...Bueller...Edition"", nor is it on this Blu-ray.JUDGMENT CALL:Back in 1986, this film was so popular.  I can remember everyone in high school watching this film many times and even today, hearing bands and people who were influenced by this film.  And suffice to say, it has become a comedy classic as many magazines and various film polls have placed it in their top 100 comedy films.Watching ""FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF"" as a teenager and watching it now as an adult, I have to admit that now, I find myself feeling differently about the film.  And I have to thank these creators of various Internet theories for definitely giving me a second take on watching this film.Most recently, the ""Fight Club"" theory has been offered on the Internet about the film revolving around a figment of Cameron's own imagination.  And for me, I know thinking things this way goes against what many people watching it at the time.  But personally, I enjoy this theory because I realize, if a ten second scene was added at the end of the film showing Cameron lying down and while he was contemplating the negativity around his life and what if this whole experience was just a dream.  Even with an ending like that, it would make the storyline much more plausible of how Ferris was able to accomplish the impossible.I know, I know...this is a John Hughes film, not a David Fincher film.  But it definitely made me think differently about the film.Because if you think about it, It would make sense of how Ferris was able to pull the impossible off, Cameron in his mind contemplating the way he would retaliate against his father and also, his feelings towards Sloane.  Everything is a figment of Cameron's imagination and to me, I'm really digging that theory versus a teenager who is constantly pulling off the impossible.But of course, purists who are reading this are probably saying, ""well, that's not how John Hughes would have wanted"" and yes, I know.  This is a film that came out in the mid-80's and when you think of past-John Hughes classics, situations that possibly wouldn't happen in reality, do happen in his films and you always get the ""happy ending"".From the rags-to-riches story of ""Pretty in Pink"", two boys who are able to generate a hot woman from a Barbie Doll of ""Weird Science"" and how people of different backgrounds in high school are all able to become good friends in ""The Breakfast Club"".  ""FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF"" was an adventure of three friends having the best day of their lives courtesy of Mr. Bueller.I suppose it shows you how overworking minds are able to come up with multiple theories for many films and TV shows and a fun, enjoyable and popular comedy classic such as ""FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF"" can definitely be analyzed (or over analyzed).But nevertheless, it seems the theory has given some new life and interest in the film and what better timing than to have the release of ""FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF"" on Blu-ray.As for the Blu-ray, it's pretty much what was offered on the ""Bueller...Bueller"" DVD edition but I figured that perhaps when the film reaches its 25th Anniversary, we may get something new or different.  But if not, for those who have never owned the DVD release, this Blu-ray is quite solid.  And of course, the picture and audio quality is much, much better than the DVD.""FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF"" is a hilarious comedy that continues to shine now as it did nearly 25-years ago.  Definitely recommended!",4,Blu-ray:  A classic teen comedy finally on HD but still without the commentary track.,1241568000,"05 6, 2009",2009,7454,"['Ferris', 'Bueller', 'Day', 'Off', 'was',

The ""Twist & Shout"" celebration in downtown Chi-Town.  The Ferrari crashing through a plate glass garage.  Matthew Broderick's impish deadpan to the camera.  Ben Stein's monotone chant, ""Bueller. . .Bueller. . .Bueller. . .""  All of the above (and more) made for one grand time when this film came out in 1986; all of the above continues to treat viewers to one grand time today.Writer/director John Hughes makes truancy downright charming as we enjoy the antics of laid-back Ferris Bueller (Broderick) and two of his buds cutting class on a delightful spring day.  Having suckered his parents (and the entire city of Chicago, for that matter) into believing he is sick, Ferris makes the best of his temporary freedom; he and his pals enjoy fine dining, a Cubs game, participate in a parade, go for a swim.  And all the while, Ferris is being pursued by his relentless, yet unlucky, principal (Jeffrey Jones is hilarious).  The administrator knows Ferris is playing hookey--he's just having one dickens of a time catching Bueller in the act.As humorous as this entire film is, it succeeds and flows and works because Broderick so aptly carries it.  Whether he's talking his best friend into ""borrowing"" the friend's father's sports car, or he's deadpanning to the camera any number of optimistic ""Buellerisms,"" Broderick is always charming, witty, and deliciously ornery.  Even after the closing credits have rolled, Broderick makes a hasty appearance to admonish his audience (""You're still here?  Go home!"").

I hate to wax nostalgic, but it's very hard for me to believe it's been 23 years since this movie's release.  While I cringe at those 80's clothes and hairdos, I'm fully aware that the comedy here remains timeless and the angst of the wasteland known as high school remains equally pertinent.Although Matthew Broderick is more renowned these days for being Sarah Jessica Parker's husband and for his role in the Broadway version of Mel Brook's ""The Producers,"" I'll forever fondly remember him for his work as the cunning, school-cutting, school clown Bueller.  It sucks to typecast an actor, but it's pretty hard to beat his performance here.This movie is loaded with so many goodie quotes that an entire review can be composed solely on that subject.  It also features a few people who got noticed here and got bigger roles: Jennifer Grey one year before ""Dirty Dancing"" and Jeffrey Jones, as Dean of Students Edward R. Rooney, two years prior to ""Beetlejuice,"" to name but two of this great cast.  For me, it's always pleasantly shocking to see previously unknown actors and actresses in older movies and wonder how you could have glanced over them in the first place (even though you can never tell who's going to be famous).I can't help but watch this from beginning to end every time - and I don't mind a single second spent watching this - even if it's the one-thousandth and first time I've watched it.  To be cliche, it gets better and better each time.From Rooney getting his to Bueller's charmingly fooling everyone (except the sister) with his fake illness to the parking attendants riding Cameron's father's Ferrari at 100-plus mph and jacking up the miles to the stuffy atmosphere of the fancy downtown Chicago restaurant Bueller smooth talks his way into to the famous scene where the impromptu rendition of The Beatles' version of ""Twist and Shout"" livens up the downtown parade (complete with the zombie walk from Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"" video from a segment of the crowd), ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" just screams classic from beginning to end.

Where his preceding efforts like The Breakfast Club and Sixteen Candles were rich, moody tales set almost unanimously in small high schools, Ferris is a plucky, enthusiastic fantasy that breaks free from the confines of an institutional setting and celebrates life outside the walls. Matthew Broderick brings the brash, popular title character to life with an energy that's so infectious it's easy to overlook a few ridiculous twists and turns, and the plot takes full advantage, pushing the envelope as far as it can feasibly get away with. Great comedic timing, an astoundingly deep, versatile cast of characters and the rocketing pace of an out-of-control avalanche help make this a timeless comedy that's aged extremely gracefully.

215230,A84Z6XUMGRMJ1,6300214753,Duane Thomas,"[40, 43]","Part 1: The MovieIf the measure of a film's popularity is how many times you've seen it, then Ferris Bueller's Day Off is my favorite movie. I've seen it 16 times: 13 in the theatre during its original run, once on videotape, twice on a recently purchased DVD (once each with and without the director's commentary track).Plot: One fine day toward the end of his senior year in high school, a young man named Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) ditches school and, with best friend Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck) and girlfriend Paige Peterson (Mia Sara) heads for the big city seeking adventure. Beneath surface events, Ferris' ""day off"" is a last ditch rescue mission designed to save Cameron's soul. This is his last chance to help Cameron, because after this school year's over they'll go to separate colleges and, effectively, a friendship that's endured since the fifth grade will be over, Cameron will be beyond Ferris' reach and aid.Ferris Bueller's Day Off has an elegantly simple, effective story structure, a classic example of separate plotlines that move concurrently, then tie themselves together at the end. There are two plot threads in this movie: (1) The story of what Ferris, Cameron and Paige do during the day off, and how these characters, primarily Cameron, are affected and changed by it. (2) The attempts of Ferris' sister Jean and Dean of Students Edward R. Rooney to expose Ferris. At the end of the movie, the two plotlines converge and resolve each other when Ferris, Jean and Rooney come together at last, and it's Jean, changed by the events of her own ""day off,"" who finally saves Ferris from Rooney.Matthew Broderick plays Ferris, for all his fast talk and con artist ways, as really the most innocent character in the movie, almost childlike in his belief he can accomplish anything. Ferris Bueller is an ultimate refutation of one of the great archetypes of comedy, The Fool.The Fool is a person of childlike innocence, who naively believes he can accomplish anything, and our amusement comes from watching him fail. The classic example of The Fool is Charlie Brown. For decades, Lucy Van Pelt said to him, ""Come on, Charlie Brown, kick the football, I won't move it."" Time after time, he fell for it. When Lucy swiped the ball out of the way at the last moment and he went flying through the air to crash down on his back, we laughed and said to ourselves, ""What a moron! I'd never be tricked like that."" We felt good about ourselves by contrast. The thing is, our amusement at The Fool is essentially meanspirited and soul-deadening. The Fool says to us, ""You can't win. The game is fixed. Any belief in yourself, that you can accomplish wonders, is false and foredoomed to failure."" What Ferris Bueller says to us is, ""If you believe in yourself....you can accomplish anything."" Then he goes ahead and does exactly that, right before our eyes.I first saw Ferris Bueller's Day Off in 1986 at the Ventura Boulevard Cinema in the San Fernando Valley. It played there for, like, four or five months. It was incredible. People simply didn't get tired of seeing it, thus the long engagement - especially by LA standards where movies tend to be there and gone. Though Matthew Broderick's portrayal of Ferris is obviously the linchpin that holds the movie together, what really made the film for me, bringing me back to see it time and again, was Alan Ruck as Cameron Frye. Without getting into a display of emotional scars here, let's just say that while I admired Ferris, I identified strongly with Cameron. Ferris is the kid we all wished we could be. Cameron is the kid so many of us really were. When Cameron explodes all over the Ferrari, he's expressing the rage for all of us.It's a wonderful fantasy there could be such a friend as Ferris, who could see our (Cameron's) pain, would move heaven and earth to help him, and the person would find the strength to take advantage of it. There's a bit of a messiah complex to Ferris Bueller, a desire to save those he deems worthy of salvation. I'm sure one of the reasons he's been friends with Cameron for so long is that Cameron so obviously needs help. Cameron Frye is a long running personal project for Ferris Bueller, and one of the engines driving Ferris' actions in the movie is the realization he's running out of time, if he wants to effect lasting, positive change in Cameron's life it's got to be NOW. My favorite moment of the film, really THE pivotal moment, is when Cameron says, ""No. I'll take the heat."" And sitting there in the theatre, I smiled and whispered, ""Good for you.""Part 2: Cast and CharactersThe four main characters, Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick), Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck), Paige Peterson (Mia Sara) and Edward R. Rooney (Jeffrey Jones) are perfectly cast. Really, all four actors do such marvelous work it's impossible to imagine anyone else in these roles.Of Matthew Broderick's portrayal of Ferris Bueller, what can I say? Wonderful. Beyond that, any poor words of mine couldn't do his work here justice. For there it stands, magnificent in its own right. See the movie, you'll know what I mean.For all the talk I've heard over the years of Ferris being ""the perfect kid,"" he's hardly a perfect person. There are aspects to his personality that aren't particularly admirable. He's deceitful and manipulative, probably a compulsive liar. When things don't go his way he becomes aggressive and abusive, shown most extremely when he slaps Cameron. But Ferris does have many good qualities. His lies are frequently in the service of the underdog, his deceptions designed to punish those who really have it coming. While Ferris manipulates those around him in the movie, most notably Cameron, he justifies it by saying it's really for Cameron's own good. From what we see in the film, he's absolutely right.It's interesting to note that, based on the director's commentary, I've always seen Ferris as being a much nicer person than his creator does. One of Ferris' most impressive qualities is a complete lack of snobbishness. We see from Ferris' home life his parents are solidly middle class. Cameron's family is rich. Paige, by her class and polish, was probably born with a silver spoon in her mouth, too. But Ferris can be friends with a white trash greaser like Garth Volbeck (Charlie Sheen's druggie character) as easily as a rich kid like Cameron. He simply doesn't see any reason he shouldn't. This total absence of classism is one of the things that wins Ferris such admiration among his peers. His friends at school go from the top of the social structure all the way to the bottom. When Grace, Rooney's secretary, lists all the various cliques at school that adore Ferris, and sums up, ""They think he's a righteous dude,"" she's right. He IS a righteous dude. To paraphrase Kipling, all men count with him, but none too much. [""If"" by Rudyard Kipling.] That whole ""walk with kings - nor lose the common touch"" thing isn't an unattainable ideal with Ferris. It's who he is.For all his prevarication, when Ferris realizes he must take responsibility for his actions, or even something not, strictly speaking, his fault, to protect a friend, he'll do it. Something else people admire about him. After the Ferrari goes though the window and into the ravine, this is the only time in the movie Ferris is scared. He knows this is bigtime. This isn't ditching school, it's the destruction of a $200,000 automobile. When he says to Cameron, ""We'll tell your father I did it. I'll take the heat,"" he means it. When push comes to shove, when the rubber meets the road, Ferris is a stand-up guy.Alan Ruck is amazingly good as Cameron Frye. All four leads seem chosen for their mobile, expressive features, but none more so than Ruck. I'm telling ya, the face of Plastic Man, folks. Ruck's features are so malleable he reminds me of a young Jim Carrey - without the goofiness.Mia Sara, as John Hughes says during the director's commentary, is a perfect Paige Peterson. This role required someone very pretty, very elegant, but also strong enough to tolerate and control Ferris Bueller. I would go further. Not only tolerate - enjoy. There's a theory in psychology called relationship balancing, the idea we subconsciously look for a partner who's strong where we're weak. Thus these two people together form in essence one fully functional personality. Paige is stable, and quite up to keeping her cool in the face of Ferris' weirdness. When Ferris asks her, ""You want to get married?"" I'm sure at least part of the reason is to tweak her, to see how she reacts. She's completely unfazed, just takes it in stride. It makes sense a person with Ferris' chaotic lifestyle would be attracted to someone with her poise. But also, beneath that calm exterior, there's enough of a wild child to Paige she can truly enjoy Ferris, and pitch in wholeheartedly, a willing partner in crime to his schemes. Really, she's perfect for him.Could anyone else on Earth have portrayed Edward R. Rooney as well as Jeffrey Jones? I think not. It's totally believable that Rooney and Ferris would loathe each other. Rooney is the sort of stupid, pompous, authoritarian control freak that a free spirit like Ferris would instantly, and correctly, recognize as a natural enemy. And vice versa.These four actors, all arguably doing the best work of their careers, are the heart of this movie.Part 3: The DVDThere's only one ""extra"" on the DVD. John Hughes' (writer and director of Ferris Bueller's Day Off) commentary track can be run with the movie. Much more so than many director tracks, there's some really good stuff here. For instance:* Matthew Broderick and Alan Ruck worked extensively with each other on Broadway before doing Ferris Bueller's Day Off, which helps explain their easy chemistry. It's no stretch to watch these two guys react to each other, and believe they've been friends for years.* The best bit of commentary, for my money, is when Hughes discusses the sequence set in the Art Institute of Chicago, which was a kind of sanctuary for him when he was in high school. The paintings in this scene are those that were his favorites. Hughes' tone of voice, the emotions he expresses during this scene, are really touching. Prior to Ferris Bueller's Day Off, the interior of this building had never been filmed for a movie, and it was a big deal for Hughes to go back to this place that had been so important to him, and show people how beautiful it is.* Charlie Sheen was only brought in for one day to play Garth Volbeck during the police station scene. With little or no time to rehearse, he burned up the celluloid anyway. If I can believe the Internet, Charlie stayed awake for 48 hours before shooting to give himself the proper strung-out look. In this scene he looks so much like his Dad at the same age it's eerie.* The parade sequence was filmed during a real parade in downtown Chicago. This wasn't a situation where the street was cordoned off and filled with extras. The Ferris crew had a float in the actual parade. No one knew who they were. The crowd didn't know, probably the city fathers didn't know. When the music for ""Twist and Shout"" started blasting, totally of their own accord, people from the surrounding areas were drawn in, started dancing and singing along. All the shots of individual faces from the crowd weren't actors, they were ""real people,"" there because they wanted to be, looking like they were having fun because they were. The construction worker dancing on a scaffold, way up on that half-finished building? A real construction worker. John Hughes saw him dancing, grabbed a cameraman and said, ""You've got to get this guy."" Then he looked at the street, saw it absolutely packed with thousands of people, all dancing and singing along with ""Ferris,"" totally into it, and said to the guy on the camera crane, ""TELL me we got that shot."" Because there's no way they could have afforded to stage it, or even imagined something that wild. It just happened. TOO cool.* There were several sequences actually filmed but cut from the final version of Ferris Bueller's Day Off. In one, Ferris goes on a radio program and talks about wanting to be the first teenager to ride the space shuttle. This was actually included in what would have been the final cut, and a trailer went out with some of that material in it. Unfortunately, the day after the trailer was released the Challenger exploded; the studio pulled the trailer and Hughes had to recut the movie to trim the shuttle stuff. I actually remember that trailer. I saw it during the day or two it was in release. If I remember correctly, a voice asks various people, ""What do you think of Ferris Bueller?"" and one of the respondents, a high school kid, says, ""Ferris Bueller? He's going to be the first teenager to ride the space shuttle.""* Also cut was Ferris' relationship with the Volbecks, the Charlie Sheen character's family. Garth Volbeck's father owns the tow company that hauls away Ed Rooney's car.* Another excised bit: In the restaurant, when Ferris, Paige and Cameron are brought menus, none of them want to admit they can't read French so they order something, then start eating, having no idea what it is. Then we get to see their reactions when they find out it's pancreas. This is referred to later in the cab scene when Ferris, listing to Cameron the things they've done that day, says, ""We ate pancreas.""It would have been nice to have the original trailer, revised trailer, and deleted scenes included on the DVD. While chances of seeing that level of work put into the DVD for a 20 year old movie, no matter how good, are slim (even assuming the chopped footage still exists) I can dream that maybe one day, on a future version of this DVD, it might happen. I'd buy it in a heartbeat.While we're on the subject of wishes, why oh why was the music from Ferris Bueller's Day Off never released as a soundtrack? A crime, since it's got one of best combination of songs I've ever heard in a movie. Another ""I'd buy it in a heartbeat"" situation that'll probably never happen at this late date.The later ""Bueller, Bueller"" edition of the film does not feature this excellent commentary

Broderick (who normally isn't all that funny) was really funny in this. Of course he had some help from Alan Ruck but still, the movie made you laugh.Like most comedies from the 80's, you have to take it as it is. Ferris Bueller is about a kid who skips school, runs around downtown Chicago on a day of fun, museums, hot tubs, fancy restaurants, prank calls and when you're in Chicago, a Cubs game at Wrigley Field is always nice.I'd recommend this one to all comedy lovers, a definite buy.

Teenager Ferris plays sick to get out of school and drags his best friend Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck - who really is sick and legitimately out of school) along for the fun.  A hilarious film about teenage angst and mischief.  That said let me point out Ive adored ALL things Broderick since I first saw him so definitely probably one or two stars just for that reason alone.  The film does not hold the power its did when I was younger for me.  Some of it's corny and ridiculous and part concerns me it may give the wrong idea to kids -- only a small part though.  I tend to give kids more credit for intelligence than most adults -- who can now legally fuss up their lives and too often do.  We expect teens to go from child to adulthood like the flipping of a switch 'cause 18 is a magic number apparently but so many treat their teens like kids it's no wonder many cry, shack their fists and bemoan &#34;what happened?&#34; when trouble finds their young adults.  This is subtitled in English for the deaf and I believe all of the special features are too (YIPPEE THANKY!!) but not 100% sure they all are now.  The odd think is there is no trailer on this special edition set.  So strange.  Anyhow being a long time John Hughes fan this is a must for all Hughes collectors.

What does it say about me that I didn't particularly care for FERRIS BUELLER.  Or to be more precise, that I did not care much at all for Ferris Bueller, the character.  A latter Tom Sawyer, as some have indicated?  Well, perhaps.  A prankster figure in the classic mode?  Well, certainly a prankster, just how classic a one is subject to debate.And to frame that debate, why not start by defining our terms?  ""Prankster"" or ""brat""?--that is the question. Does Ferris hold an ironically, distorting mirror up to society, and help his friends to realize some kind of personal liberation?  Or is he a selfish, little narcissist who does what he wants, no matter what the consequences.  Without going on at length about the storyline (which doubtless every reader of this review already knows), is he really that good a friend to Cameron, dragging, as he does, his genuinely ailing best friend out of his (Cameron's) sickbed.  Is it really such a good thing for Cameron to accept the entire blame for the destruction of his father's sports car?  Yes, Cam wil finally get to confront his indifferent, materialistic father, but is that ""liberation,"" or suicide?  And how fortunate for Ferris that after a few mild protestations, he gets to blithely skip off.  Why not a least be there for his friend when the latter has to face some very dissonant music?I know, I know.  It's only a movie--an absurd comedy at that.  A live action cartoon, wherein the clever mice are all-American teenagers and the buffoonish cats are just about every adult they encounter.  On that level, it works well enough.  And teen audiences should certainly relish seeing the adult figures getting their comedownance.  It's surreal in an overtly adolescent sense of the word.  It's a world where parents are dumb, high school principals are obsessive villains (believe me, in real life, most of them are more indifferent than vindictive).But I feel almost compelled to get back to the Cameron/Ferris dynamic.  That's the plot element that really interests me.  Cameron is one of those doofus kids, who somewhat reluctantly always ends up doing what his more assertive, manipulative ""best friend"" wants him to do, and winds up confusing the trouble he gets into for a kind personal liberation.  There's one born every other minute.  Usually right after of the birth of a scheming brat who, in a few short years, will become the poor sap's ""best friend.""",3,Ferris Wheels And Deals,1124323200,"08 18, 2005",2005,2485,"['Almost', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'kind', 'Rohrschach', 'test', 'suppose', 'What', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'care', 'FERRIS', 'BUELLER', 'be', 'more', 'precise', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'much', 'Ferris', 'Bueller', 'character', 'latter', 'Tom', 'Sawyer', 'have', 'indicated', 'Well', 'perhaps', 'prankster', 'figure', 'classic', 'mode', 'Well', 'certainly', 'prankster', 'just', 'how', 'classic', 'one', 'subject', 'debate.And', 'frame', 'debate', 'why', 'not', 'start', 'defining', 'terms', 'Prankster', 'brat', 'question', 'Ferris', 'hold', 'ironically', 'distorting', 'mirror', 'up', 'society', 'help', 'friends', 'realize', 'kind', 'personal', 'liberation', 'selfish', 'little', 'narcissist', 'who', 'what', 'matter', 'what', 'consequences', 'going', 'length', 'storyline', 'doubtless', 'reader', 'review', 'already', 'really', 'good', 'friend', 'Cameron', 'dragging', 'genuinely', 'ailing', 'best', 'friend', 'Cameron', 'sickbed', 'really', 'such', 'good', 'thing', 'Cameron', 'accept', 'entire', 'blame', 'destruction', 'father', 'sports', 'car', 'Yes', 'Cam', 'finally', 'get', 'confront', 'indifferent', 'materialistic', 'father', 'liberation', 'suicide', 'how', 'fortunate', 'Ferris', 'few', 'mild', 'protestations', 'blithely', 'skip', 'off', 'Why', 'not', 'least', 'be', 'there', 'friend', 'when', 'latter', 'face', 'very', 'dissonant', 'music', 'know', 'know', 'only', 'movie', 'absurd', 'comedy', 'live', 'action', 'cartoon', 'wherein', 'clever', 'mice', 'are', 'all-American', 'teenagers', 'buffoonish', 'cats', 'are', 'just', 'adult', 'encounter', 'level', 'well', 'enough', 'teen', 'audiences', 'should', 'certainly', 'relish', 'seeing', 'adult', 'figures', 'getting', 'comedownance', 'surreal', 'overtly', 'adolescent', 'sense', 'word', 'world', 'where', 'parents', 'are', 'dumb', 'high', 'school', 'principals', 'are', 'obsessive', 'villains', 'believe', 'real', 'life', 'most', 'are', 'more', 'indifferent', 'vindictive', '.But', 'feel', 'almost', 'compelled', 'get', 'back', 'Cameron/Ferris', 'dynamic', 'plot', 'element', 'really', 'interests', 'Cameron', 'one', 'doofus', 'kids', 'who', 'somewhat', 'reluctantly', 'always', 'up', 'doing', 'what', 'more', 'assertive', 'manipulative', 'best', 'friend', 'do', 'up', 'confusing', 'trouble', 'kind', 'personal', 'liberation', 'one', 'born', 'other', 'minute', 'Usually', 'right', 'birth', 'scheming', 'brat', 'who', 'few', 'short', 'years', 'will', 'become', 'poor', 'sap', 'best', 'friend']",N/A

215260,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,6300214753,Haunted Flower,"[2, 2]","""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" was written by John Hughes in a WEEK because he had an idea and knew he had to make it happen quickly before an oncoming writers' strike. Hughes' directing is always memorable, he knows just how to edit a funny scene to get the most out of it with different perspective shots thrown together. In this story, Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) along with his best friend, Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck) and girlfriend, Sloan (Mia Sara) skip a day of school to enjoy a day in downtown Chicago seeing the sights in a fabulous sports car.This movie resonates with so many different people because we all have that innate human quality where we crave freedom and a day away from the grind just to do whatever we want. Where we dare to dream, Ferris makes it happen with charm and finesse. No situation can break him as he tip toes around getting caught by his sister, Jeanie (Jennifer Grey), his parents, and his principal, Edward Rooney (Jeffrey Jones).Matthew Broderick was a young, charismatic (not to mention, CUTE!) guy who had a background on Broadway in Neil Simon plays like ""Brighton Beach Memoirs"" (a favorite of mine from my theater days) where his character would spend a lot of time addressing the audience (AAAHH, you're breaking the fourth wall!). That fourth wall break is a difficult thing to do because you have to win over the audience immediately or they won't enjoy hearing the story from your perspective. The character of Ferris is a ""righteous dude"" who never actually harms anyone throughout the course of the movie so his reputation as an idol to the student body holds up. He is just so charming and knows just the right degree of push to get someone to do what he wants.Alan Ruck was performing with Broderick on Broadway at the time and there was a concern that his age would make him too old but in the play, both characters were young so they decided to give him a shot for Cameron. Already being friends made it easier to be best friends here. Cameron is a nice, smart, funny guy who lets everyone push him around and the main reason Ferris takes this day off is to try and help his friend. I think everyone has a little bit of Cameron in them with his nerdiness and fear of authority. Mia Sara plays Sloan, the classy girlfriend of Ferris who can keep up with him. In a pinch, she can act her way out of any situation just like him.The ineffective antagonist of the movie is Principal Edward Rooney who wants to catch Ferris and make him an example to other kids so they wouldn't get any ideas like him. Ferris is a symbol for all that is disobedient and anti-conformist, making him miserable at his job. Jeffery Jones' portrayal (and all actors in this film for that matter) just defined him as an actor. Every actor in this movie is remembered for simply BEING in this movie and a lot of careers got off the ground here.DVD Extras:There are three featurettes: ""Getting the Class Together: The Cast of Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" which interviews the cast years later about how the film impacted their careers and lives, ""The Making of Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" which covered more of the events at the time and how actors ended up in their roles, and ""Who is Ferris Bueller?"" which explores the character and what he meant to that generation and every generation afterwards since this movie still holds up.There were a lot of fun things to learn about the movie, for example, the actors who played Ferris' parents met for the first time on the set and went out on some dates to get to know each other better for the movie and later got married in real life.Ben Stein was an unknown in the movie world, his background was being a speech writer for Richard Nixon and was supposed to just be an offscreen voice calling roll but the director thought he was so funny, it got switched to on camera. Then he was asked to improv a classroom scene teaching the kids about something he knew a lot about so he talked about the Great Depression and of course, it was hysterical. Ben Stein admits he's not an actor and could never do an accent to save his life but people want him for his distinctive voice and every single day people come up to him just to say ""Bueller...Bueller...Bueller."" There's also a feature called ""The World according to Ben Stein"" where again he emphasizes how being in this movie changed his life forever for the better and embarks some of his own personal philosophies on life and living.Another feature is ""Vintage Ferris Bueller: The Lost Tapes"" that shows Matthew Broderick, Alan Ruck, and Mia Sara messing around on the set and interviewing each other and Jeffrey Jones about being in the movie. It's really cute and fun to see them interacting with each other and having a great time with Broderick still wearing the leopard-print vest!I do not know a single person who doesn't like or better yet, LOVE this movie. It just means so much to so many people. For me, it's my favorite escape movie when I'm sick or just bummed out because it always lifts me with its comedy.",5,Bueller....Bueller....Bueller Special Collection's Edition 1 Disc Widescreen

It's not that his idea of ditching is ingenious; a lot of high school students take a random day off school, and ever since this movie's release in 1986, there have been dozens of movies and TV episodes where kids have played hooky. It's not even Ferris Bueller's first time skipping out on school--he tells the audience in the beginning that he's ditched class nine times already that year.What actually makes this movie ""work"" are the great balance of humor and seriousness: the principal trying to catch truants, the sister trying to get her brother in trouble, and a boy who wants to get more attention from his busy father. All these characters and others are portrayed comically, yet in such a way that you can still relate to their relationships. A lot of the comical elements in the movie were fairly new when this movie came out, and some have not been overused yet, making the humor in this movie pretty original.And of course there's more to the movie you're bound to like.

What happens next can only be described as remarkable and somewhat crazy.Broderick stars as Ferris Bueller, a somewhat clever and deceitful (in a funny way) high school senior who, along with his best friend Cameron (Alan Ruck) decide to skip school and visit the sights and sounds of downtown Chicago in springtime.  Ferris convinces Cameron to take his father's prized red Ferrari out for the day.  Reluctantly, Cameron agrees, and soon the two are off on their adventure.  Their next plan is to get Ferris' girlfriend Sloane (Mia Sara) out of school so she can go along.  Ferris and Cameron devise a plan to call the school and tell Dean of Students Ed Rooney (Jeffery Jones) that Sloane's grandmother passed away.  Dressed in a long trenchcoat and hat, Ferris arrives at the school to pick up Sloane, and the three drive happily away.  However, Mr. Rooney suspects that something is up and immediately suspects that Ferris is at the root of it.  He sets off to find Ferris himself and bring him back to school.  By the end of the movie, Mr. Rooney probably wishes he had stayed in his office.Meanwhile, Ferris' sister Jeannie (Jennifer Grey) has figured out what Ferris is really doing.  Angry that Ferris seems to get away with everything, she has to deal with the entire school taking up a collection for poor, sick Ferris while she really knows what is going on.  In the end, though, she proves to be a big help to him.After heading downtown, the trio take the Ferrari to a local parking garage.  Cameron's father knows the exact mileage of the car, so Cameron is already nervous about allowing Ferris to drive it.  But that's just the beginning.  The garage attendant decides to take the car out for a joyride and racks up over 180 more miles on the odometer.During their day,Ferris, Cameron, and Sloane manage to see the Sears Tower, a Cubs game, visit the Art Institute, and see Ferris sing ""Twist and Shout"" from a parade float.  But when they head back to the garage to get the car, Ferris finds out about the extra mileage, and Cameron goes crazy.  Ferris seems to think that by driving backwards that the miles will come off, so they jack the car up in the garage and put it in reverse.  However, the miles don't come off.  Cameron, having suffered through a tumultuous relationship with both of his parents, takes out his aggression on the car.  Soon, it goes careening out of the back of the garage and lands in a pile of trees.  Cameron actually feels relieved because now his father will actually have to talk to him.  But Ferris realizes that he has only 5 minutes to get home before his parents do.  Will he make it in time?This movie has attained a sort of ""cult"" status over the years and still remains as funny as ever.  Matthew Broderick is perfect as the scheming Ferris, while Jeffery Jones does a very good job as Mr. Rooney.  Jennifer Grey plays the part of the overlooked and jealous sister perfectly, and Alan Ruck's job as the reluctant and somewhat confused Cameron is the perfect companion to the wild and reckless Ferris.

This includes, marriage, not seeing friends anymore, breaking away from parents, and ultimately, independence.

Granted, it's a little old, and a lot has changed since then. But this barely touches it comedic glory. With a perfect cast, a witty script, and a fun musical scene, this movie is one of the best I've seen in some time.A young, handsome Matthew Broderick begins the story of Ferris Bueller, a popular, slick high school student who simply refuses to go to school on a beautiful day. Clearly the favorite child, Ferris milks an ""I'm sick"" day out of his charmingly oblivious parents (don't we all wish parents were like that?), grabs his best friend and his girlfriend, and heads out for the most exciting day of his life.Without Broderick, the film would have fallen flat. His character could have come off bratty and insufferable if it weren't for the young actor's charm and heart. His best friend, the conastantly-worrying Cameron (Alan Ruck) is comedic gold, and his story arc is presented flawlessly throughout the story. Bueller's girlfriend, Sloane (Mia Sara) offers the other half of a whole for Bueller, keeping him grounded- or rather, as grounded as he can get. The trio make an excellent cast, and put all their effort forth to make the movie work. As the crooked-toothed ""villain"" of the movie, Bueller's principal obsessed with blowing his student's cover, Jeffrey Jones is genius. His character is hatable (is that even a word?) and yet we end up feeling somewhat sorry for the unlucky principal, who falls prey to Bueller's perfect plans.The movie is just all-around charming. With a sequence of adventures all narrated by Broderick as he continually breaks the fourth-wall (something that simply adds to the film's perfection), we grow to care for all the characters and appreciate the stories tagging along, such as those of Bueller's hateful sister Jeanie, the secretary Grace, and a surprise scene showing us a young Charlie Sheen. It looked like the kind of fun, creative movie everyone enjoyed working on.""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" is a unique movie that only comes around once in a while, the kind that truly deserves five stars.

215295,A240QB45BSMDAN,6300214753,Josh P.,"[0, 0]","Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) is a kind of hero to every high-school aged young adult out there. He's the kind of guy whom we all want to be, really. He acts like he doesn't have a care in the world, and lives life to fullest. The opposite of this guy would be his best friend Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck), a sort of uptight worrywart who deserves to be brought out of his shell by the easygoing Ferris. In this film, Ferris fakes out his parents into calling it another ""sick"" day for him, his ninth to be exact. In order to convince just about everyone that he is really sick, he consults his collection of electronic sound effect equipment for the process. Another antithesis of Ferris is his life-is-not-fair sister Jeannie(Jennifer Grey) who suspects something is up, as does the sly-but-not-so-slick Dean of Students, Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones).It's funny how so many trains of thoughts seem to dominate this movie and in the events that happen For instance, Ferris says that he has to keep coming up with new illnesses in order to make 10 sick days. It's amazing; people, like his parents who are most easily duped, would think that this one sick kid when in reality, he's having a ball. However, knowing that if he gets cauught and may not graduate, he decides to make this one count and be worthwhile. Ferris and Cameron bail out Ferris' girl Sloane (Mia Sara) with a dead grandmother ploy, and together the trio spend the day doing the town in Chicago driving the '61 GT convertible (Oh, yeah!). This movie has a special message and feeling to it that's as old as time. It's about conquering fears mostly and just really appreciating life. For after all, as our hero says: ""Life moves pretty fast; if you don't stop to take a look every once in a while, you might miss it."" That's the moral of the story, really.""Bueller...Bueller...Bueller?""

This movie is packed with such hilarious one-liners it is hard not to. Ferris Bueller is a child of relative privelege who decides he would rather enjoy a great spring day then spend it trapped in school (who wouldn't?). He brings his best friend and girlfriend with him and they live it up for the day in Chicago, while their principal tries desperately to catch them. They lie their way into a super-fancy restaurant, take in a Cubbies game and dance and sing on a parade float. Meanwhile, rumors are flying around the school, each making Ferris closer to death than the last, which annoys his sister because she is stuck there.  There are a couple of anxious moments when they very nearly get caught, but never actually do. The characters are wonderfully created and acted, his parents are totally clueless, his sister is vindictive and Ben Stein is hilarious as the world's most boring history teacher. ""Anyone, anyone?""

The angry sister and principal are good foils to his shenanigans, and there is a definite value to the recurring (bomp-shicka-shicka) theme of the soundtrack. The most compelling subplot is that of high strung friend Cameron, who is convinced to borrow his father's highly prized car without permission.

I think  it's a great movie.  It's hilarious, and unlike so many comedies these  days, has great character development in the midst of it's lunacy.  Sure,  it's a light comedy.  But the feelings about leaving high school and moving  on are in there too.  And of course, &quot;Twist &amp; Shout&quot; is  deliriously entertaining.As far as the DVD goes ... it's a good job.  The menu is colorful and easy to use. There's not a lot of bonus stuff, but  I found director John Hughes' commentary fascinating.  Yes, I actually  listened to the entire film with Mr. Hughes commenting!  For film buffs, it  is very interesting to learn things about how films are shot.  Mr. Hughes  shares stories about how they tried to make L.A. look like Chicago; how  they filmed a certain scene quickly, and didn't get it quite right, because  it was threatening to rain; how &quot;Cameron&quot; had problems keeping  his eyes wide open because it was so bright.... etc. etc.  Very interesting  stuff.Thanks Mr. Hughes!

I was so thrilled to see that Paramount was giving this classic film an upgraded DVD Special Edition. Upon seeing it however, I must say that I'm pretty disappointed. The extras, although enjoyable, are sorely lacking what they could and SHOULD be. Most of the film's major stars (and sometimes even minor ones like Kristy Swanson and Richard Edson) provide some updated interviews that are fun to watch. But, the bonus material and interviews featuring Mia Sara are all from 1986! She obviously CAN'T be that busy these days, so doesn't it make sense that an updated interview with her could have been included?Also, the shooting script for this movie contains MANY deleted scenes and dialogue, some of which were a GREAT read and are bound to have been filmed. Ferris going through the house looking for money in some STRANGE places (all while the Pink Floyd tune &#34;Money&#34; was playing), as well as Cameron's dad seeing his 1961 Ferarri being driven through Chicago's streets by the two parking garage employees would have been GREAT to see. However, the ONLY deleted scene we get here is a behind-the-scenes version of the waiter at Chez Qui telling the trio that the food they were eating was pancreas (which of course was referred to later by Ferris in the taxi). No true special edition DVD should be without a deleted scenes section. VERY disappointing.Next, this edition (like the original) does NOT include a theatrical trailer. It's rare for even a bare bones DVD not to include at least one trailer, but nearly UNHEARD of for a special edition!

Hind ""daria_m""","[1, 2]","If I could have driven a Ferrari, visited the sites of Chicago, dined at a fancy restaurant, and danced to the Beatles on a parade float, I might have skipped school more often.Ferris Bueller, whom Matthew Broderick was born to play, is determined to have a good time.  He takes risks we couldn't imagine getting away with, and manages to escape each one with reputation and health unharmed.  The appeal of his story, one of John Hughes' greatest in his Shermer Series, is the fact that we wish we could be him.  Sure, his sister and the high school principal hate him, but he doesn't seem to care too much.  A kid with that much popularity and charisma should expect some jealousy from others.Alan Ruck was perfectly cast as his neurotic best friend Cameron Frye.  After all, Ferris needed someone with a bit of rationality to balance him out (or at least to be his naive partner in crime).  While Broderick provides a lot of insight and clever dialogue, Ruck lends some slapstick humor.  Watch the scene where Cameron is sitting in his car, for example.  ""I'LL GO, I'LL GO, I'LL GO, I'LL GO!""  He is also spotlighted in the film's premier dramatic moment when Cameron finally sums up his distant relationship with his father.  And that Ferrari?  May it rest in peace.Other comic relief comes from Jeffrey Jones as the evil Principal Ed Rooney.  Most of the laughs come at his expense though.  But hey, I might have laughed if my high school principal had been mauled by a dog and kicked the face by Jennifer Grey.  He is the antagonist who only gets what is coming to him.""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" is a comedy that will probably never go out of style, even if the clothes and the posters on Ferris' wall reflect the spirit of the eighties.

Unfortunately, that's the reality of life: smart alec kids have to grow up sometime, even if they're as cool as Ferris.And that's the beauty of Ferris. He's an eternal teenager, captured in that nexus between childhood and adulthood that we all had to endure. But nobody endured it as well as Ferris does, which is why he's so lovable.Much has been written about the humor in Matthew Broderick's performance, but little has been written about the tone. Broderick is tone-perfect - a little more mellow, and you have Bill and Ted; a little more manic, and you have Jon Cryer. Ferris is cool, but not unflappable. He's cocky, but slightly unsure of the future. He's a smart aleck, but he's earnest, and he's brave to boot. He's the quintessential teenager, albeit one who does things that all of us wish we'd had the balls to do.And Ferris is all too aware that this magical time in his life is going to end pretty soon. That truth adds an almost subliminally sad subtext to this film, which is ostensibly about being an exuberant teenager. That's a pretty neat trick for a movie that's supposed to be little more than a silly teenage romp, isn't it?Eventually, all of us have to grow up. All except Ferris, that is. We never have to watch his teenage precociousness turn into grown-up irresponsibility. Hell, that's what happens to us all at some point, and it will never happen to Ferris.Isn't that the beauty of this movie? By seeing Ferris in his eternal teenage glory, maybe we can all catch a glimpse of the funny, rebellious, cocky, noble people we all once were during that period between childhood and adulthood - and probably never will be again.By the way, the suggestion that this film is lost on subsequent generations is absolute twaddle.

But FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF isn't just a comedy -- it's a whimsical, nostalgic look at high school and a lesson in not taking yourself too seriously.Ferris Bueller wakes up one morning late in his senior year and decides, for the ninth time that semester, that he doesn't feel like going to school. Ferris has no trouble employing melodramatic reverse-psychology on his parents (""I - I have a test today - I want to go to college and have a fruitful life."") and soon finds himself free for the day, with his parents off at work and his disgusted sister Jeannie at school.So he calls up Cameron, his best friend, who really is sick, because, as Ferris tells us, ""He's the only person I know who actually feels better when he's sick."" Cameron's father barely pays him any attention, preferring to dote on his newly-restored red Ferrari. And it is this Ferrari that Ferris decides to drive to pick up his girlfriend Sloan from school.With Cameron's unheeded protests following them, the threesome spend their day, the last glorious day of truancy they can spend before going off to college.Cameron's story is what makes this more than just a comedy, more than just a lighthearted, funny movie. The symbolism of the car is well done and subtle, as is the portrayal of Cameron's relationship with his father, which rings true because of the many people I know with this exact same sort of parental problem.Overall, this is a great, funny, poignant movie, a tribute to living, instead of getting caught up in life.Rating: Very Good",5,"""It is his love, it is his passion...""

But Ferris Bueller's Day Off made him a teen sensation.Director / Writer John Hughes by this time perfected the high school movie.  Ferris (Broderick) is from an upper class family in Chicago.  Both his parents work and he has a sister.  Every so often, Ferris needs a day off from school.  Today is one of them.  But a day off alone is no fun.  Chances are his best friend (Alan Buck) is having one of his hypochondriac days and his father has a Porsche convertible.  That just leaves springing his girlfriend (Mia Sara), which of course Ferris does with ease.The only problem is the principal.  He wants to nail Ferris and his crew.  Of course in a John Hughes movie the heavy only gets humiliation.The trio head out for a wild day in downtown Chicago.  The best parts are the Musuem of Art and the parade sequence.This is not a deep film, it is a wildly entertaining film.  Broderick is charming and incorrigible as the hero and is the film.

The story is deceptively simple, with Ferris (Broderick) bunking off school with his girlfriend Sloane and best friend Cameron and spending a wild day in New York city.  Convinced he's faking it, Ferris' headmaster and sister are desperate to uncover him.This is the kind of movie that makes you wish that the lives on screen were your lives.  Who wouldn't want to press their faces against the glass of the Empire State Building, drive around in a Ferrari or, more importantly, sing Twist and Shout on top of a float accompanied by a marching band?  These are moments that you wished defined your own life and this is helpful because Ferris' philosophising about not missing out on life would have come off as ridiculous otherwise.  For pretty much everyone who's seen this as a kid they will tell you that it affected them in the same way.  The themes of friendship, love and what it is to be a teenager have nowhere been so universally evoked.As Ferris, Broderick is perfectly cast.  Smug, fun-loving and above everything else cool, he's that thing that very few movies seem to have these days - a character you can identify with.  If you like this then it's a fair bet you watched it when you were a teenager.  Ferris Bueller is pretty much a shared experience that you won't be able to explain why it's so, for want of a better word, cool.  Only teenagers will get it and maybe that's the way it should be.  It hasn't lost its sparkle, the ageing audience can't identify with it anymore.

He has an answer for every question and a solution to every problem.  He is extremely popular at school and his parents dote on him.

The movie takes place over the course of a day when Ferris fakes being sick and he takes a trip to Chicago with his best friend Cameron and his girlfriend Sloan.  All the while, Mr. Rooney suspects that Ferris is not sick and cutting school.  He fumbles around Ferris' house looking for him while the kids are living it up in the Windy City.  The film moves along at a quick pace and all the characters are very likable.  One nice trick Mr. Hughes uses is that he has Ferris turn away from situations and address the audience.  We feel as if we become a part of the ride.  Mr. Broderick is perfect as Ferris. He exudes charm and is quite funny.  Alan Ruck (now of Spin City) is funny as the morose Cameron.  Mia Sara doesn't have much to work with as Sloan, but she is quite striking.  Jeffrey Jones is great as the bumbling Mr. Rooney.  Jennifer Grey is a bit annoying as Ferris' sister.

I was laughing so hard while watching this movie that I just could not stop. Matthew Broderick is awesome in this movie. Anyway, FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF is basically about a high school kid named Ferris Bueller - duh - (played by Broderick) who hates going to school. So he's always trying to think of ways to stay home, mostly through pretending to act sick. One day, while he's faking his illness to stay home on a beautiful day, he decides to get his girlfriend out of school and his best friend (who's actually really sick in bed) to come with him and hang out. Well, they end up going on some &quot;wild rides&quot; while skipping school...and the entire day the principal of their school is trying to follow Ferris and get him into trouble!

215383,A3GRU9732S4V1U,6300214753,"Robert Jenkins ""video geek #1""","[15, 19]","This movie came out right around the beginning of my senior year of high school.  It was then, and still is, one of the FUNNIEST movies I have ever seen!  Matthew Broderick plays the title role of Ferris Bueller, a high-school kid who decides that he just can't make it through his last semester of his senior year without taking one last day off (This is my ninth sick day this semester.  If I go for ten, I'm probably gonna have to barf up a lung, so I better make this one count!).  Alan Ruck plays Ferris' best friend, Cameron Frye (Why can't you let me rot in peace?), who is ACTUALLY sick that day and home alone in bed.  Mia Sara plays Ferris' girlfriend, Sloane Peterson, who also is in the mood to take a day off.  Jeffrey Jones is Ed Rooney, the school principal who sees through Ferris' scheme right away and decides that this time, he's gonna catch Ferris in the act and &quot;put one heck of a dent in his future&quot;.  Jennifer Grey is Jeannie Bueller, Ferris's sister who also knows that Ferris is skipping and wants to catch him to show her parents that Ferris is not the perfect child they think he is.  The supporting cast is wonderful, especially Edie McClurg as Ed Rooney's airheaded secretary, and Charile Sheen as a drugged-out punk with a remarkable way of getting to the heart of problems.As the movie begins, we realize pretty quickly that this is NOT just Ferris waking up one morning and deciding to skip, but rather a well-planned conspiracy between Ferris and Sloane to skip school, cover their tracks, grab Cameron (willing or not), and spend a day with Cameron's dad's Ferrari tooling around downtown Chicago.  Ferris' task is made much easier by the fact that his parents believe that he is the most perfect child ever who can do no wrong.  Ferris comments when his parents swallow his lie about being sick and then head off to work, &quot;One of the worst performances of my career, and they never doubted it for a second.&quot;  Clearly, Ferris has trained them well.  The plan unfolds - Ferris drages Cameron out of bed, they pick up the Ferrari, pull Sloane out of school with the old &quot;dead grandmother&quot; routine, and then its off for a day on the town.  Unbeknownst to them, Rooney and Jeannie both are on to them, and have independently decided to ttrack them down and bring them to justice.  Neither of them, of course, is any match for Ferris' ingenuity.As the movie unfolds, it becomes clear that Ferris is doing more than just skipping.  Ferris and Cameron are about to start two different colleges in the fall, and Sloane still has another year of high school.  Ferris' life is about to change, and he's scared.  He's also trying to get Cameron loosened up a bit before he heads off to college, and Cameron needs it.  Cameron has his own problems to resolve.This movie is not just about high school, its about teenage life in general.  Hughes nails life during the teen years very well here, as he also did in several other films during the '80s.Although some of the subject matter is fairly weighty, Hughes still manages to come up with a script LOADED with hilarity.  Some of my favorite bits include:(1)  Ferris playing the Blue Danube on his keyboard (trust me).(2)  Ferris infiltrating the German-American day parade in downtown Chicago to comandeer the float and sing a great rendition of &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; by the Beatles (with his dad dancing along, clueless as usual, in his office high above).(3)  Rooney's first attempt to capture Ferris in a video arcade.  In all of Chicago, did Rooney really think he had a chance of finding Ferris by just looking around at random?(4)  Lunch.  (&quot;Four thousand restraunts in the downtown area.  I pick the one my father goes to.&quot;)(5)  The frantic race to get home before Jeannie and his parents find out he's not really sick in bed.(6)  The myriad places where the phrase &quot;Save Ferris&quot; is up all over Chicago, including a water tower and the marquee at Wrigley Field.(7)  Ben Stein as the world's most boring teacher, and his student's pathetic attempts to pay attention and stay awake.(8)  The closing credits.  Definitely don't turn off this film until there is nothing but a black screen.There are many, MANY more great bits in this film.  It's not really all that dated, either, other than the cars and clothes and such.  It's a movie that high-schoolers related to in 1986, but I bet high-schoolers today could relate to it just as much.  It really is a timeless film about coming of age.

Can't say really why I didn't like it, because I like Matthew Broderick (my fave role of his being Philippe &#34;The Mouse&#34; in the exquisite &#34;Lady Hawke&#34; starring Michelle Pfeiffer and Rutger Hauer).  When I saw Ferris Bueller was available to watch on Amazon Prime I figured, what the heck, I'd reacquaint myself with this period piece and see if it was more palatable to me with a hindsight view.  Well...I was surprised how many of the actors (notably Jennifer Grey, Ben Stein and Charlie Sheen) I did NOT remember being in this flick -- which was kinda fun -- but...my perception of the film is basically the same as I remember it from years gone by.  It's cheeky -- glorifying the triumphs of a bright, sneaky charmer as he manages to get away with one con after another.  Sure, the film wasn't filled with the in-your-face sex-drugs-and-rock-n-roll kind of smut that increasingly permeates so many films in the last 20 years -- but for me (and Matt and I come from the same generation) I felt kinda like Ferris' sister in the movie: it really did not please me to see him heralded for being everyone's hero because he could out-con everyone.  SO... all that being said -- if you are one of those people who doesn't think films either reflect or impact our culture, then you will probably get a kick out of Ferris Bueller as he cuts school for the 9th day of his senior year.  I sat through the whole thing and was not so entertained.

I can't think of anyone that has seen this film as a teen and not liked it or related to it in some way.Matthew Broderick is Ferris, a dry humored, too smart for his own good Chicago area high school student that decides to play hooky with his girlfriend Sloane (Mia Sara) and best friend, Cameron (Alan Ruck). Playing his jealous and malicious sister, Jeannie, is Jennifer Grey, in a memorably hilarious performance that takes her on a mission from hell to get her brother busted.The movie follows their adventures and the bittersweet realization that high school is not forever, as well as Cameron's own little rite of passage, which I will not give away here because Ruck does a great and believable job and its just fun to watch it unfold, especially the first time.I could have given this movie 5 stars, but I refrained from such a high honor for two reasons.  You have to wonder how two people as lost and Mr. and Mrs. Bueller could have spawned such a genius in Ferris, for he fools them in ways that perhaps we all thought of while we were in high school, but knew that we would never get away with. No one actually would get away with such an elaborate set up, and no one could think ahead to the possibilities that this film presented and not be considered psychic. The elaborate set up also makes a person shake their head because it's not always so simple to get away with skipping school, but it's not breaking out of Bergen-Belsen either!The second reason this film does not receive 5 stars is because while I stated and hold to the opinion that this is a timeless film that has its appeal to young kids today, it has been overplayed on television now for years, and I can only watch it once every few years, unlike ""The Princess Bride"", which I can watch over and over again without tiring of it.",4,Timeless,1102723200,"12 11, 2004",2004,1957,"['reviewer', 'page', 'must', 'disagree', 'editorial', 'review', 'movie', 'lost', 'subsequent', 'generations', 'see', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'seen', 'film', 'teen', 'not', 'liked', 'related', 'way.Matthew', 'Broderick', 'Ferris', 'dry', 'humored', 'too', 'smart', 'own', 'good', 'Chicago', 'area', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'play', 'hooky', 'girlfriend', 'Sloane', 'Mia', 'Sara', 'best', 'friend', 'Cameron', 'Alan', 'Ruck', 'Playing', 'jealous', 'malicious', 'sister', 'Jeannie', 'Jennifer', 'Grey', 'memorably', 'hilarious', 'performance', 'mission', 'hell', 'get', 'brother', 'busted.The', 'movie', 'adventures', 'bittersweet', 'realization', 'high', 'school', 'not', 'forever', 'as', 'well', 'Cameron', 'own', 'little', 'rite', 'passage', 'will', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'here', 'Ruck', 'great', 'believable', 'job', 'just', 'fun', 'watch', 'unfold', 'especially', 'first', 'time.I', 'could', 'have', 'given', 'movie', '5', 'stars', 'refrained', 'such', 'high', 'honor', 'two', 'reasons', 'have', 'wonder', 'how', 'two', 'people', 'lost', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Bueller', 'could', 'have', 'spawned', 'genius', 'Ferris', 'ways', 'perhaps', 'thought', 'were', 'high', 'school', 'knew', 'would', 'never', 'get', 'away', 'one', 'actually', 'would', 'get', 'away', 'such', 'elaborate', 'set', 'up', 'one', 'could', 'think', 'ahead', 'possibilities', 'film', 'presented', 'not', 'be', 'considered', 'psychic', 'elaborate', 'set', 'up', 'also', 'person', 'shake', 'head', 'not', 'always', 'so', 'simple', 'get', 'away', 'skipping', 'school', 'not', 'breaking', 'Bergen-Belsen', 'second', 'reason', 'film', 'not', 'receive', '5', 'stars', 'stated', 'hold', 'opinion', 'timeless', 'film', 'appeal', 'young', 'kids', 'today', 'been', 'overplayed', 'television', 'now', 'years', 'can', 'only', 'watch', 'once', 'few', 'years', 'Princess', 'Bride', 'can', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'tiring']",N/A

215422,A27YE6HPUFIWI4,6300214753,Taylor T. Carlson,"[6, 7]","This review is for the Blu-Ray edition.Ferris Bueller's Day Off is directed by John Hughes. The film stars Matthew Broderick, Alan Ruck, Mia Sara, Jeffrey Jones, Jennifer Grey, Charlie Sheen, Ben Stein, Richard Edson, and Edie McClurg. Contributors to the musical score include Ira Newborn, Arthur Baker, and John Robie.Ferris Bueller is a Chicago high school student who, like so many others, is sick and tired of long, boring school days. So he comes up with the ultimate plan - fake an illness to get out of going to school, and use that day to get together with his friend s, and do everything fun the city has to offer. Once he is up and about, he teams up with his girlfriend and his reluctant, constantly depressed and nervous buddy. And borrowing the latter's father's priceless sports car, the trio heads downtown to partake of numerous activities. But what Ferris doesn't know is that the school's dean is aware of his less-than-stellar attendance habits, and is out to bust him by any means necessary.The movie is a classic - one of those few eighties movies that really stands the test of time, and never manages to feel dated. Prior to shifting over to the world of family-friendly cinema, John Hughes was the master of teenage angst films. And perhaps no movie he ever participated in demonstrates that more than this one. There are laughs to be experienced around every corner, and yet the film is never raunchy or explicit. It's a success on every level.Ferris Bueller's Day Off's cast is one of the greatest assets the film has going for it. Matthew Broderick brilliantly portrays the title character. Always entertaining and always lovable, Brod erick's performance here is arguably the finest of his career. The other stand-out is Alan Ruck as Cameron, Ferris' always-fearful companion from a broken home. Other great performances include Jennifer Grey as the title-character's uptight sister, Jeffrey Jones as the high school's over-the-top dean who will stop at nothing to bring Ferris down, and Edie McClurg as the dean's goofy secretary. Some brief (but no less memorable) performances include Ben Stein as the boring, monotone economics instructor, Charlie Sheen as a drug addict in a police station, and former Sonic Youth member Richard Edson as a crooked parking attendant. The movie is filled with excellent performances.Alongside its cast, another great thing the film has going for it is the storyline, and the way the film explores it. It's a simple, to-the-point storyline so many people can relate to - who among us all hasn't wanted to ditch school for the sake of having a great day? The trio goes all across the city, and the comical scenes never stop. The tone of the film is perfect - always comical and entertaining, yet never raunchy or explicit.Music for the film is composed by multiple composers. Amongst them is Ira Newborn, who would also compose the music for numerous other films/shows/artists/etc, including the Naked Gun films. The songs featured in the film come from a variety of sources and cover numerous genres - each one of which always suiting a certain scene in the film perfectly. Sadly though, John Hughes refused to release a soundtrack album, as he felt the songs wouldn't work well together as an album. As such, many songs featured prominently in the film, including the Flowerpot Men classic Beat City, are now highly sought after. Great music.... I only wish there was a soundtrack that had it all together!This is one of those movies where I'd been waiting for the Blu-Ray for a long time - after all, it's one of the greatest films of the eighties. And let me be the first to tell you this Blu-Ray transfer does not disappoint. It's not the best vintage film transfer I've seen in HD, but it's certainly above average, given what I've seen for other films of the same era. Detail throughout the presentation is sharp, and there is an enhanced amount of detail I couldn't see in any old DVD presentation of the film. The grain level is consistent, and never interferes with the viewing process. My only real complaint image-wise is that a few shots look too soft , and some facial textures lack depth. Still, a small complaint. A lossless audio track only sweetens the deal, bringing the dialogue and widely-diverse musical score to life like never before. All in all, Ferris Bueller's Day Off on Blu-Ray shouldn't disappoint.Special Features: This is a straight-up port of the Bueller Bueller Edition DVD, so all of the same features are present here. There are various making-of and other vintage featurettes detailing the creation of this classic film, as well as a photo gallery. Disappointingly, everything is presented in standard definition. Still, it is a nice variety of bonus material and I'm grateful we got anything on the disc at all. I wasn't expecting all the features from the previous DVD release, so this actually comes as a pleasant surprise.One complaint I must make, however - like the Bueller Bueller edition DVD, this version of the movie DOES NOT include the John Hughes commentary from the original DVD release. I don't see how hard it would have been to slap it on the Blu-Ray port.All in all, Ferris Bueller's Day Off stands the test of time, and this Blu-Ray is the new definitive version of the movie on the market. The movie itself doesn't fail to please, and a great transfer makes this package all the more appealing. If you've got a Blu-Ray player, steal your dad's prized Ferrari, rush to the nearest store, and pick up this disc.",5,A classic film finally gets a Blu-Ray release,1241654400,"05 7,

This special edition contains the original film with a digitally remastered 5.1 surround soundtrack. There is also a fairly good amount of bonus features, including a very nice documentary on the process by which the film makers selected the actors and actresses who would play Ferris, Sloane, Cameron, Jeanie, and Mr. Rooney. These bonus features contain interviews with the actors/actresses 20 years after the film was released, which provides a nice retrospect.The movie itself follows the exploits of Ferris Bueller, a larger-than-life high school senior and a rebel with a cause who decides to skip school one spring morning. Bueller hooks up with his girlfriend Sloan and best pal Cameron and has a little fun in downtown Chicago. Meanwhile, the school's iron-fisted principal, Mr. Rooney, has caught on to Bueller's shenanigans and vows to catch Ferris playing hookey red-handed. Ferris's angry, bitter sister Jeanie is determined to bring down her brother as well. In the end, Ferris has the last laugh as he eludes his enemies and stands tall with pride.This movie is loaded with tons of laughs and great acting. Matthew Broderick became an over-night star with his performance as Ferris Bueller, and Alan Ruck is terrific as Cameron, an uptight, stressed-out teenage son of over-protective parents. Director John Hughes includes some nice cinemetography of various Chicago locales, such as the shores of Lake Michigan, Wrigley Field, the Sears Tower, and downtown Chicago.Ferris Bueller's Day Off remains the best of the ""Brat Pack"" 1980s flicks that centered on wise-cracking teenage schoolers (Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club, etc.) Fans of the film will be very pleased with this collector's edition.",5,"""If you have the means, I highly recommend picking one up.""",1138060800,"01 24, 2006",2006,1850,"['was', 'very', 'pleased', 'see', 'Paramount', 'released', 'special', 'collector', 'edition', 'classic', '1980s', 'film', 'Ferris', 'Bueller', 'Day', 'Off', 'special', 'edition', 'original', 'film', 'digitally', 'remastered', '5.1', 'surround', 'soundtrack', 'also', 'fairly', 'good', 'amount', 'bonus', 'features', 'including', 'very', 'nice', 'documentary', 'process', 'film', 'makers', 'selected', 'actors', 'actresses', 'who', 'would', 'play', 'Ferris', 'Sloane', 'Cameron', 'Jeanie', 'Mr.', 'Rooney', 'bonus', 'features', 'contain', 'interviews', 'actors/actresses', '20', 'years', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'nice', 'retrospect.The', 'movie', 'exploits', 'Ferris', 'Bueller', 'larger-than-life', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'rebel', 'cause', 'who', 'skip', 'school', 'one', 'spring', 'morning', 'Bueller', 'up', 'girlfriend', 'Sloan', 'best', 'pal', 'Cameron', 'little', 'fun', 'downtown', 'Chicago', 'Meanwhile', 'school', 'iron-fisted', 'principal', 'Mr.', 'Rooney', 'caught', 'Bueller', 'shenanigans', 'vows', 'catch', 'Ferris', 'playing', 'hookey', 'red-handed', 'Ferris', 'angry', 'bitter', 'sister', 'Jeanie', 'determined', 'bring', 'down', 'brother', 'as', 'well', 'end', 'Ferris', 'last', 'laugh', 'enemies', 'tall', 'pride.This', 'movie', 'loaded', 'tons', 'laughs', 'great', 'acting', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'became', 'over-night', 'star', 'performance', 'Ferris', 'Bueller', 'Alan', 'Ruck', 'terrific', 'Cameron', 'uptight', 'stressed-out', 'teenage', 'son', 'over-protective', 'parents', 'Director', 'John', 'Hughes', 'nice', 'cinemetography', 'various', 'Chicago', 'locales', 'such', 'shores', 'Lake', 'Michigan', 'Wrigley', 'Field', 'Sears', 'Tower', 'downtown', 'Chicago.Ferris', 'Bueller', 'Day', 'Off', 'best', 'Brat', 'Pack', '1980s', 'flicks', 'centered', 'wise-cracking', 'teenage', 'schoolers', 'Sixteen', 'Candles', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'etc', 'Fans', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'pleased', 'collector', 'edition']",N/A

Not like movies aren't on a wish-fullfilmant level sometimes, which is the case here.

This is tragic.Ferris Bueller is a laugh-out-loud comedy that epitomizes the eighties teen-movie genre: All the usual John Hughes ingredients are here, including the adolescent angst, the deservedly humiliated high-school principal and the teen romance. There are even some truly poignant moments in there amid the hilarity. And the director lenses his native Chicago with great affection.It took me quite a few minutes to settle into the commentary, until I realized director John Hughes's style was deliberately ironic, and from thereon in I enjoyed it immensely.

He takes a day off, dogs best bud Cameron Frye into joining him and girlfriend Sloane Peterson, using the dead grandma excuse. They use Cam's dad's 1961 Ferrari, which his dad likes more than his family. However, Ferris' sister Jeannie doesn't buy it, and his principal Ed Rooney chases him like a hungry hound dog; Bueller is one absence away from repeating his senior year, so Rooney would like to have that happen. Meanwhile, the trio joyrides all over Chicago in the priceless car, eating at expensive restaurants, seeing priceless art, attending Cubs games, and the finisher: Ferris sings two classic 60s songs in a parade in front of thousands. Later, Cameron wrecks the Ferrari and is slowly gaining self esteem. Then Ferris is almost exposed by Rooney, but his sister bails him out, of all people.
