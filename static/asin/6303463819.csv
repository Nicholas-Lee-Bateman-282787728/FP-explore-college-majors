Rent this one, or you might take a hard fall, rather than a fond trip, down memory lane!Props to Sam Raimi for trying to act like a sleazy backstabber, and succeeding brilliantly. He should act more often.Brigitte is in usual fine form as an intergalactic vengeance machine bent on destroying the villain who wasted her colony. Nice of Richard Moll to take time off of playing villains for OTHER directors to do this one. And credit to the sleaze bag gangster for livening up the place by being shot through three walls and SMILING cheezily the entire way!Gawd, I miss the old sleaze like Waxwork II, Future Kick, and Subspecies.",3,About as good as I remembered,1372896000,"07 4, 2013",2013,734,"['Saw', 'one', 'tape', '90s', 'Ho', 'boy', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'abolishment', 'blue', 'screen', 'Rent', 'one', 'might', 'take', 'hard', 'fall', 'rather', 'fond', 'trip', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'Props', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'trying', 'act', 'sleazy', 'backstabber', 'succeeding', 'brilliantly', 'should', 'act', 'more', 'often.Brigitte', 'usual', 'fine', 'form', 'intergalactic', 'vengeance', 'machine', 'bent', 'destroying', 'villain', 'who', 'wasted', 'colony', 'Nice', 'Richard', 'Moll', 'take', 'time', 'playing', 'villains', 'OTHER', 'directors', 'do', 'one', 'credit', 'sleaze', 'bag', 'gangster', 'livening', 'up', 'place', 'being', 'shot', 'three', 'walls', 'SMILING', 'cheezily', 'entire', 'way', 'Gawd', 'miss', 'old', 'sleaze', 'Waxwork', 'II', 'Future', 'Kick', 'Subspecies']",N/A

375768,A2SUCCLWUA9H2S,6303463819,David R. Courtney,"[0, 2]","""Galaxis"" is the second worst film that I have seen in my life.  The acting was atrocious.  The sets and effects were more appropriate to 1970's Dr. Who.  The characters were one-dimensional and the plot was predictable.  The only thing lower than my interest level was the budget for the film. The only redeeming feature is that this is a convenient way to get a good look at Sylvester Stallone's ex-wife Brigitte Nielson.For those of you who are curious, the worst film that I ever saw in my life was 2012:Doomsday (This is the Christian end-times garbage that should not be confused with the History channel's Doomsday: 2012 or the mainstream film ""2012"", both of which I thought were pretty good.)",1,Don't waste your time,1290988800,"11 29, 2010",2010,701,"['Galaxis', 'second', 'worst', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'life', 'acting', 'was', 'atrocious', 'sets', 'effects', 'were', 'more', 'appropriate', '1970', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'characters', 'were', 'one-dimensional', 'plot', 'was', 'predictable', 'only', 'thing', 'lower', 'interest', 'level', 'was', 'budget', 'film', 'only', 'redeeming', 'feature', 'convenient', 'way', 'get', 'good', 'look', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'ex-wife', 'Brigitte', 'Nielson.For', 'who', 'are', 'curious', 'worst', 'film', 'ever', 'saw', 'life', 'was', '2012', 'Doomsday', 'Christian', 'end-times', 'garbage', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'confused', 'History', 'channel', 'Doomsday', '2012', 'mainstream', 'film', '2012', 'thought', 'were', 'pretty', 'good']",N/A
