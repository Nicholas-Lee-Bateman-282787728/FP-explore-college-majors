Saxelid ""Bookworm""","[5, 6]","It's been something like 14 years since William Wesley made an impressive debut with the atmospheric and creepy horror film Scarecrows (DVD please!).  In waiting so long to make a follow up did the writer/dirctor hope to avoid the dreaded sophomore slump?  Well, if that was his intention, the man failed, utterly.  Route 666 is pretty much a disappointment for anyone expecting a tight and fun thrill ride.Federal Agents Lou Diamond Phillips and Lori Petty capture escaped witness Steven Williams.  Just before their back-up arrives a posse of hitman show up and start firing.  Here Wesley shows his big artistic contribution to the film, he wiggles the camera up and down and back forth in an irritating manner so the viewer can't see how lackluster the action is.  The trio escapes, a sole surviving hitman in pursuit, and, in a bad decision, the group decides to take a short cut along Route 666, a condemned/deserted highway that was closed down due to a chaingang accident that, in a contrivance that gets the eyes rolling, happens to be linked to Phillips character's family history.  It is not too long before the chaingang's ghost zombies (the movie can't decided which they are so they are both) show up and begin pounding victims into the pavement.  The road needs blood, you see.On the plus side the movie does feature a great b-movie cast (legendary character actors Dick Miller and L.Q. Jones get to join in on the fun) and the movie is polished and professional looking.  Steven Williams shows some comic relief skills (and gets a great in-joke for his stint as Mr. X on The X-Files).  On the downside the script is atrocious (the graveside exposition is a low point worth mentioning) and the characters behavior largely decided by the action instead of vice versa (why do the bad guys show up and begin shooting people needlessly when they have no reason and nothing whatsoever to gain by doing so?  Because they are BAD guys and that is what BAD guys do!) and WHY is L.Q. Jones wearing sunglasses indoors while reading a book?  Did he get his pupils dilated during the shoot or something?Final thought?  Route 666 is a disappointment, granted an entertaining one, but, considering what this director is capable of, one not worth more than the price of a rental.",3,Wesley's sophomore slump is strictly midde of the road.,1015977600,"03 13, 2002",2002,2278,"['been', 'something', '14', 'years', 'William', 'Wesley', 'made', 'impressive', 'debut', 'atmospheric', 'creepy', 'horror', 'film', 'Scarecrows', 'DVD', 'please', 'waiting', 'so', 'long', 'make', 'follow', 'up', 'did', 'writer/dirctor', 'hope', 'avoid', 'dreaded', 'sophomore', 'slump', 'Well', 'was', 'intention', 'man', 'failed', 'utterly', 'Route', '666', 'pretty', 'much', 'disappointment', 'anyone', 'expecting', 'tight', 'fun', 'thrill', 'ride.Federal', 'Agents', 'Lou', 'Diamond', 'Phillips', 'Lori', 'Petty', 'capture', 'escaped', 'witness', 'Steven', 'Williams', 'Just', 'back-up', 'posse', 'hitman', 'show', 'up', 'start', 'firing', 'Here', 'Wesley', 'big', 'artistic', 'contribution', 'film', 'camera', 'up', 'down', 'back', 'forth', 'irritating', 'manner', 'viewer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'lackluster', 'action', 'trio', 'sole', 'surviving', 'hitman', 'pursuit', 'bad', 'decision', 'group', 'take', 'short', 'cut', 'Route', '666', 'condemned/deserted', 'highway', 'was', 'closed', 'down', 'due', 'chaingang', 'accident', 'contrivance', 'eyes', 'rolling', 'be', 'linked', 'Phillips', 'character', 'family', 'history', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'chaingang', 'ghost', 'zombies', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decided', 'are', 'so', 'are', 'show', 'up', 'begin', 'pounding', 'victims', 'pavement', 'road', 'blood', 'see.On', 'plus', 'side', 'movie', 'feature', 'great', 'b-movie', 'cast', 'legendary', 'character', 'actors', 'Dick', 'Miller', 'L.Q', 'Jones', 'get', 'join', 'fun', 'movie', 'polished', 'professional', 'looking', 'Steven', 'Williams', 'comic', 'relief', 'skills', 'great', 'in-joke', 'stint', 'Mr.', 'X', 'X-Files', 'downside', 'script', 'atrocious', 'graveside', 'exposition', 'low', 'point', 'mentioning', 'characters', 'behavior', 'largely', 'decided', 'action', 'instead', 'vice', 'versa', 'why', 'do', 'bad', 'guys', 'show', 'up', 'begin', 'shooting', 'people', 'needlessly', 'when', 'have', 'reason', 'nothing', 'whatsoever', 'gain', 'doing', 'so', 'are', 'BAD', 'guys', 'what', 'BAD', 'guys', 'do', 'WHY', 'L.Q', 'Jones', 'wearing', 'sunglasses', 'indoors', 'reading', 'book', 'Did', 'get', 'pupils', 'dilated', 'shoot', 'something', 'Final', 'thought', 'Route', '666', 'disappointment', 'granted', 'entertaining', 'one', 'considering', 'what', 'director', 'capable', 'one', 'not', 'more', 'price', 'rental']",Route 666

A cursed road, a long-dead chain gang killing people, Lou Diamond Phillips - all wrapped up in a Lionsgate box?  The best you can really hope for is some laughs.  Thankfully, Steven Williams supplies many of those with his very entertaining performance in what is otherwise a real dud of a film.  Maybe someone could have made a decent film out of this story, but director William Wesley obviously cannot.  The whole plot is just hopelessly contrived.  I hope Wesley didn't actually think he was making a horror film - it's pretty hard to be scared when you're busy laughing at how ridiculous the zombie ghosts (or whatever they are) look and behave.Personally, I'm not heading down any cursed road closed for decades, but U.S. Marshal Jack La Roca (Lou Diamond Phillips) decides to take the Route 666 shortcut in his rush to get a reluctant witness back to L.A. so he can testify against some really bad guys the next morning.  Heck, there are six witness protection agents in two cars accompanying him - what could possibly go wrong?  So what if a quartet of violent criminals died long ago on the desert road in a chain gang ""accident""?  Those odd visions La Roca keeps having?  Pshaw - nothing to worry about there.  He has a job to do, dadgummit, and he's going to do it.  Then again, what's the big hurry when you can stop and explore a desert cemetery in the middle of nowhere?  It is here - with two agents fighting each other and two other agents sneaking off to do the very opposite of fighting - that our ashy chain gang shows up, tools in hand and ready to shovel-whack or jackhammer any human being they can get their oddly non-ethereal hands on.  These guys aren't going to run you down, but they are persistent - and, as luck would have it, they aren't the only obstacle the characters face as they try to make it to the other end of the cursed road.There are a couple of plot twists thrown in to the overall mix, one of which is obvious early on and really does the film no favors in the end, and Steven Williams has a number of funny lines, so I guess I should give the writers a little credit - but the whole story is heavy on clich&eacute;s and short on suspense.

I only watched it as it was on TV one Saturday afternoon - liked it so much I had to buy it.When WILL Lion's Gate get it together?That being said, ""Route 666"" stars Lou Diamond Philips, Lori Petty, Steven Williams (""Mr. X"" on ""The X-Files"") and Dale Midkiff (""Pet Sematary"").

Everyone ends up on Route 66 but, due to a series of circumstances, have to take the long-closed Route 666 (there really WAS a Route 666 once) as it's a short-cut to LA and to avoid the hitmen.

What I got was a complete mess of a so-called ""horror movie"".  The idea and the name of Route 666 sounds good, but the movie is a complete flop.  Basically, ""Route 666"" is about a condemned highway or road where some really bad prisoners died and were buried in a cemetery off the highway.  Strange things start appearing to our lead character Jack played by Lou Diamond Phillips.  Ultimately, the ghost prisoners return from the grave to wreck havoc on the outlanders who dared to travel on Route 666.  It might sound halfway decent, but trust me, it's not.  It's an awful flick!The acting in ""Route 666"" is pretty terrible, the directing is awful and the movie takes on a rock n' roll persona that destroys any possible horror atmosphere, mood or theme for this flick.  ""Route 666"" is completely lacking in style, atmosphere and substance, all of which are necessary for a horror movie's effectiveness, and Route 666 hasn't got any of these things.

They decide to use the closed-down Route 66 as a short cut. Turns out it's closed down for a reason. Whenever people travel the road, 4 convict zombies rise from the asphalt (complete with chain-gang tools!) to kill and mutilate. Being an admirer of director William Wesley's first feature, Scarecrows (1988), I was expecting another unique, scary and exciting B-movie. But it's none of the above. The best thing about it are the cool-looking zombies, but Wesley chose to shoot all of the action scenes with a shaky and frenetic camera.It looks superficial and ruins any suspense. It's disappointing to think he might've used this technique because the film takes place entirely in daylight, and he thought the zombies weren't convincing enough. They look great, and it would've been so much more enjoyable to just watch them attack without all the distracting camera movements. Not to say it would make this film much better. It's filled with irritating &quot;hip&quot; dialogue and endless sarcastic lines, the plot is ridiculous and the sub-plot about one of the chain-gang corpses being Lou Diamond Phillips' dad is laughable. And people looking for graphic gore will also be disappointed, there's some, but it's infrequent and consists mainly of splattered blood.

668719,ACBA805501SEU,B00005NKC6,Matthew Skidmore,"[0, 0]","Director William Wesley hasn't made a movie in years (after his excellent debut with the dark and atmospheric SCARECROWS), so I was interested to see how his new film fared. The story is easy. FBI agents Lou Diamond Phillips and Lori Petty are escorting escaped informant Steven Williams back to the witness stand so that he can testify against the mafia. The problem is that they have to get back home, and to do that, they have to drive through the notorious Route 666 of the title. This strip of road is the site of a long buried secret concerning four hardened convicts (who are part of a chaingang) who are killed in a bizarre accident in 1967. These four criminals now roam the highway as ghosts, only drawn out into the daylight by the passing motorists.The movie itself zips along at a fair pace. The lead threesome are very good: Lou Diamond Phillips and Lori Petty in full action mode with Steven Williams (so good as the serial killer hunter in the lacklustre JASON GOES TO HELL) playing it for laughs and keeping the audience on side. The movie itself benefits not only from strong leads, but also from a great supporting cast who give the movie a strong anchor. The soundtrack is excellent and extremely fitting for the look of the picture plus the atmospheric cinematography is great (the movie is always set in daylight, so when the ghouls show up you see them in full and yet this natural disadvantage of always showing your villain helps the look of the picture tremendously). Director Wesley shows he still has the knack at creating bangs for your buck on a low budget. The disc itself boasts a pretty decent transfer of the film, and benefits greatly from the widescreen format (even on DVD and my small 28'' TV screen, the movie still looks big and has an epic feel to it).

one nonetheless I have always liked very much.This to me falls under the category of ""sleeper"".A lower budget film that sort of flies under the radar and doesn't get the attention it deserves.Made in 2001,""Route 666"" concerns the exploits of an NSA agent Jack Larosa played convincingly by Lou Diamond Phillips.He is sent to get and escort an AWOL gent under the witness protection program called ""Rabbit""(Steven Williams) who has managed to slip out from under the very FBI agents who are also tagging along.Just as LaRosa nabs ""Rabbit"" three hit men from the mob who ""Rabbit"" is testifying against, arrive to ""reclaim"" him.A gunfight ensues and the agents get away with their catch but with one very alive hitman in pursuit.This is in Arizona presumably along a stretch of old Route 66.In order to get their catch back to L.A. in time for the trial they decide to take a short cut through an old abandoned and very closed section of the route called Route 666.This section of the road was closed presumably due to a chain gang ""accident"" which occured back in the late 60s,but as we soon see there is more to the closure than that.Along the way Jack has increasing ""visions"" popping into his head concerning the chain gang ""accident"".Through either an accident,coincidence or fate,it seems Jacks' very father was amongst the chain gang that was killed and as the movie goes on we find they were deliberately murdered.Furthermore the sprits of the four gang members are restless and walk the old Route looking for victims to take back into the road with them,the very place they were laid to rest.And when they take you back it is not a pretty sight,as they carry and use the very tools they had when they originally died to great effect.One by one various members of the FBI group are killed as it is learned,for some a little late,that the road is not a safe place to be caught on.It is also revealed that the local sheriff knows all about the road and was directly involved in the killing of the gang members and doesn't want anyone to know,even if it means killing Jack,the witness and the remainder of the FBI to keep it quiet.The wild card through all this of course are the gang members themselves who come and go constantly wreaking terror and havoc amongst the group.In the end the Sheriff gets his,Jack makes a final connection with his father and three people are left to walk away from one hell of a day, towards L.A.The movie never slows its' pace one bit and while the dialogue and feel of the movie may be a little B movie-ish that is also its' charm.Another thing that helps maintain the pace is the taut editing.This movie comes in around 86 minutes but that tension is never lost and is well maintained throughout.The actors give it all they have too.Phillips is your perfect tough ex-Navy Seal turned NSA agent,Steven Williams as ""Rabbit"" gives a bravura performance,and Lori Petty(""Tank Girl"") also turns in a surprisingly good performance as Stephanie,the FBI agent.Phillips,Petty and Williams are the triumverate core of the movie and they are the last men standing,as it were,when the picture finally fades.In conclusion I highly recommend this film to all but youngsters, as many scenes are quite graphic.It's a great thrill ride that never loses its' punch.And unlike ""Dusk to Dawn""(another favourite) it carries very little padding whatsoever which heightens the tension and impact even more.It's not perfect,it does have its' flaws but it's one heck of a ride and I like it.",3,Route 666-Three and a half stars-One

668731,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00005NKC6,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Route 666 (William Wesley, 2001)Steven Williams is one of those actors who, in my opinion, always makes anything he's in just that much better. It must have been pretty tough to do with Route 666, which sports one of the downright silliest scripts to come down the pike in I don't know how long, but Cuban director Wesley (Scarecrows) obviously decided to try and save it by picking up the best cast he could for the small budget he must have had, and Williams shines here, as do a number of smaller players who are similarly fine. Too bad about everything else, though...Route 666 tells the tale of a bunch of Federal witness protection marshals, led by Secret Service agent Jack LaRoca (Lou Diamond Phillips), who hunt down a fugitive named Rabbit (Williams) and have to get him back to Los Angeles for a trial where he's agreed to testify against a mafia boss. They get lost on back roads, eventually ending up coming out on Route 66 where an old, condemned extension, Route 666, is supposed to go all the way to the California border. Despite rumors that the road is supposedly haunted by the ghosts of prisoners who died while working on the road, including LaRoca's father, LaRoca decides to take the road in order to save as much time as possible. The crew are pursued by both mafia hit men and a local corrupt sheriff and his deputies, but that's the least of their worries...A bad movie this is, truly, but it's saved from complete unwatchability by the performances of a number of the cast. Williams' rapidfire comic timing makes every scene he's in good, and Gary Farmer, in a small cameo, is as great as Gary Farmer is in everything. You should throw believability out the door once they get on the road (disappointing, as the first part of the movie showed real promise as an action thriller), but it's got enough going for it to make it worth watching once.

It stars Lou Diamond Phillips ""Riiiiiitchie!"", Lori Petty, and Shaft's cousin Steven Williams(whose one of those guys you know you've seen in a bunch of stuff before, but just can't remember what.) Now Lou Diamond is a very good actor but has also done quite a bit of good b in his days. This one is no exception. It's a nice little b horror straight out of 2001, just past Sid's favorite decade for b but still in a good range.The film takes place in the desert whic is always a reciepe for some solid b when it comes to horror. Jack La Roca (Lou) and his partner Steph (Petty) are escorting Shaft's brother across the desert trying to save him from being wacked. His in the witness protection program and decided to flee sending some gumbas to come looking for him. Luckily Ritchie Valens came to bring him to safety only to run into a pack of ghost/zombie street toughs. There's no way to bring these things down so they are a pretty scary bunch. Eventually the mighty Jack La Roca was there to figure out a way to put an end to the gang, look at the scoreboard it choas.For our first Lou Diamond entry we have to say it was a successful one. The film is really entertaining with the perfect amount of b sprinkled in. The cast were surely d list and the zombie gang was really interesting looking. They were like a bunch of stone looking zombie's that lived under the road, only coming out when they here people above. That's pretty scary f you ask Sid. We can honestly recommend Route 666 for a good b horror watch, and assure you that it would've been enjoyed years ago.",4,Ritchie Valens takes on a zombie chain gang who haunt Route 666,1248652800,"07 27, 2009",2009,1688,"['Route', '666', 'one', 'films', ""'ve"", 'caught', 'few', 'times', 'now', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'way', 'now', 'Lou', 'Diamond', 'Phillips', 'Riiiiiitchie', 'Lori', 'Petty', 'Shaft', 'cousin', 'Steven', 'Williams', 'one', 'guys', 'know', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'bunch', 'stuff', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'what', 'Now', 'Lou', 'Diamond', 'very', 'good', 'actor', 'also', 'done', 'quite', 'bit', 'good', 'b', 'days', 'one', 'exception', 'nice', 'little', 'b', 'horror', 'straight', '2001', 'just', 'Sid', 'favorite', 'decade', 'b', 'still', 'good', 'range.The', 'film', 'place', 'desert', 'whic', 'always', 'reciepe', 'solid', 'b', 'when', 'horror', 'Jack', 'La', 'Roca', 'Lou', 'partner', 'Steph', 'Petty', 'are', 'escorting', 'Shaft', 'brother', 'desert', 'trying', 'save', 'being', 'wacked', 'witness', 'protection', 'program', 'decided', 'flee', 'sending', 'gumbas', 'come', 'looking', 'Luckily', 'Ritchie', 'Valens', 'came', 'bring', 'safety', 'only', 'run', 'pack', 'ghost/zombie', 'street', 'toughs', 'way', 'bring', 'things', 'down', 'so', 'are', 'pretty', 'scary', 'bunch', 'Eventually', 'mighty', 'Jack', 'La', 'Roca', 'was', 'there', 'figure', 'out', 'way', 'put', 'end', 'gang', 'look', 'scoreboard', 'first', 'Lou', 'Diamond', 'entry', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'successful', 'one', 'film', 'really', 'entertaining', 'perfect', 'amount', 'b', 'sprinkled', 'cast', 'were', 'surely', 'd', 'list', 'zombie', 'gang', 'was', 'really', 'interesting', 'looking', 'were', 'bunch', 'stone', 'looking', 'zombie', 'lived', 'road', 'only', 'coming', 'out', 'when', 'here', 'people', 'pretty', 'scary', 'f', 'ask', 'Sid', 'can', 'honestly', 'recommend', 'Route', '666', 'good', 'b', 'horror', 'watch', 'assure', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'enjoyed', 'years', 'ago']",Route 666

B movie kind Lou Diamond Phillips plays Jack La Roca, a U.S. Marshall and former Navy SEAL assigned to pick up ""Rabbit"" (Steven Williams), a member of the witness protection program.  He and his team of marshalls including Steph (Lori Petty) is supposed to take him from Arizona to California to testify in court.They find themselves followed by the mob and decide to take a detour down a closed section of highway known as Route 666.  But from there things take a turn for the worse.  They find that this stretch of highway has been abandoned and closed because it's haunted by members of a prison chain gang who died on the highway years ago.  The tension builds smoothly as the group of Marshals, outgunned by the mobsters takes refuge at an abandoned business in the desert and they become jumpy, fighting amongst themselves as their situation and the hauntings become worse.Typically everyone overacts, espcially Petty and Dale Midkiff, playing another Marshal, and there's a ridiculous subplot where one of the chain gang ghosts was La Roca father which was really unnecessary to the plot.  Still, there's a decent amount of creepiness to the movie, much more than you have a right to expect in such a cheapie flick.

Lou Diamond Phillips and Lori Petty as crack FBI agents (!?!) pull Steven Williams out an assassination attempt and decide to flee across the closed highway of the title to get him to LA to testify against some random mobsters.  Why they do this pretty much defies logic; I mean, the state doesn't just decide to close highways for no reason, people.  Does it ever occur to them that the road might be, oh, say washed out?  Impassible?  Nope.  They mention that the road is dangerous (well since it's supposed to be a highway, but it's about as wide as you average suburban driveway, I bet it is pretty dangerous.  Unless it was meant for interstate moped travel), knock down the barriers and barrel on down the road.  Leaving those barriers conveniently down for the assassins to follow.  Hey, why not just paint a sign- ""They went that'a'way!""Of course, on the road, the tires on their cars melt, so they'll have to hoof it.  To Los Angeles.  In the desert.  All the better so that they can be attacked by the blood-thirsty (and hopelessly comical looking) zombies that haunt the road.  You see, route 666 is haunted by the death of four of the chain-gang who constructed it, who died a mysterious death.  Well, it will be mysterious to anyone who had never seen a movie before, or read a book.  Or been out of the house.  In any case, the road needs blood to survive, and we are told ""somebody always bleeds""  Must be a lot of skinned knees on the moped expressway.  So, we are treated to a lot of extras being pounded into the pavement (in what can only be called Jerk-O-Vision) while the Karo syrup flies.  Do I need to tell you that there's a corrupt sheriff involved?  That one of the zombies is related to one of our heroes?  That Lori Petty is about as believable as a crack FBI agent as, well as Lou Diamond Phillips is?
