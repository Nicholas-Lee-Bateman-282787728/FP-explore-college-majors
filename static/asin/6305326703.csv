460198,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,6305326703,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[29, 32]","Some men in this world, one Peter Rinaldi (Alex McArthur) in particular, would apparently prefer that the hottest woman on the face of the earth (Rose McGowan, who plays troubled teen Debbie Strand) not fall in love with them far beyond the point of simple obsession.  I know - it's hard to believe.  Sure, the guy already has a girlfriend he loves, and granted, Debbie is a &quot;minor&quot; who also happens to be one of his students, but come on - this is a consistently scantily-clad Rose McGowan we're talking about.  Right or wrong, Rinaldi eventually finds out that refusing the love of this gorgeous young woman really does no one any good whatsoever.  Okay, I'm going on a little bit, so I will state for the record that teachers should not have any sort of personal relationships with any of their students, even if that student is Rose McGowan.  The thing to do would be to wait for Debbie to graduate, of course, but young Debbie has nothing but green lights at the traffic stops of her trouble mind.  She takes what she wants, getting rid of anything that gets in her way, and what she wants is creative writing teacher Peter Rinaldi.Luckily for us, the viewing audience, Debbie's new high school does not have a dress code.  If girls were allowed to dress the way Debbie does, the number of male high school dropouts would go immediately to zero.  I know I should talk about the plot, and I will, but for me this movie is first and foremost about just watching the entrancing Rose McGowan; gorgeous doesn't even begin to describe her.  Alas, though, her character Debbie Strand is not perfect.  She has a tendency to fall madly in love and stalk a school teacher from time to time, she is not above stealing, and she is just deliciously vindictive, jealous, and - well - evil.  Oh yeah, she also kills people sometimes.  It's not all her fault, though.  Her childhood was not a happy one, and when we first meet her, her house has just burned down (with her mother and one of her teachers inside).  Off to grandmother's house she goes, into a new environment that frankly just doesn't suit her or meet her needs.  Grandma is apparently related by blood to Carrie White's mother, as she is a puritanical woman determined to turn Debbie into a good Christian girl, even if she has to beat the devil out of her to do it.  The rest is pretty simple.  Her flirtation with young Mr. Rinaldi quickly snowballs into the kind of obsession that leaves a trail of bodies in its wake.  The predictable ending is something of a let-down, but this is for the most part a darn good movie.Some of the peripheral characters could have used some building up, especially the detectives investigating the big fire and slowly putting two and two together; it's hard to take two guys seriously when all they do is quiz each other on the spellings and definitions of difficult words.  Really, though, this movie comes down to two characters, and we do get to know each of them pretty well.  The fact that Rinaldi can resist Debbie's increasingly forward advances makes him either a sort of superman or an incredible fool.  As for Debbie, we get a pretty good handle on her early on, long before we learn all of her secrets - these secrets, plus the unfriendly reaction toward her by certain people, actually make her a sympathetic character of sorts.  The story sort of plays it loose early on, but once the climactic buildup for the conclusion begins forming, this story of obsession, love, and derangement shifts into overdrive and takes us down cinematic curves that leave us screaming with excitement despite the imminent danger always there in front of our eyes.  Take away those stupid vocabulary quizzes by the two detectives, and I would probably have given this film five stars.  Even if this were the worst film ever made, though, it would still be worth watching just for Rose McGowan.  She is simply stunning in this motion picture, exhibiting acting skills that nearly approximate the depth of her unique beauty.  Believe me: evil never looked so good.",4,Rose McGowan is pure evil - I think I'm in love,1068681600,"11 13, 2003",2003,4056,"['men', 'world', 'one', 'Peter', 'Rinaldi', 'Alex', 'McArthur', 'particular', 'would', 'apparently', 'prefer', 'hottest', 'woman', 'face', 'earth', 'Rose', 'McGowan', 'who', 'troubled', 'teen', 'Debbie', 'Strand', 'not', 'fall', 'love', 'far', 'point', 'simple', 'obsession', 'know', 'hard', 'believe', 'Sure', 'guy', 'already', 'girlfriend', 'granted', 'Debbie', 'quot', 'minor', 'quot', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'one', 'students', 'come', 'consistently', 'scantily-clad', 'Rose', 'McGowan', ""'re"", 'talking', 'Right', 'wrong', 'Rinaldi', 'eventually', 'out', 'refusing', 'love', 'gorgeous', 'young', 'woman', 'really', 'one', 'good', 'whatsoever', 'Okay', ""'m"", 'going', 'little', 'bit', 'will', 'state', 'record', 'teachers', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'sort', 'personal', 'relationships', 'students', 'even', 'student', 'Rose', 'McGowan', 'thing', 'do', 'would', 'be', 'wait', 'Debbie', 'graduate', 'course', 'young', 'Debbie', 'nothing', 'green', 'lights', 'traffic', 'stops', 'trouble', 'mind', 'what', 'getting', 'rid', 'anything', 'way', 'what', 'creative', 'writing', 'teacher', 'Peter', 'Rinaldi.Luckily', 'viewing', 'audience', 'Debbie', 'new', 'high', 'school', 'not', 'have', 'dress', 'code', 'girls', 'were', 'allowed', 'dress', 'way', 'Debbie', 'number', 'male', 'high', 'school', 'dropouts', 'would', 'go', 'immediately', 'zero', 'know', 'should', 'talk', 'plot', 'will', 'movie', 'first', 'foremost', 'about', 'just', 'watching', 'entrancing', 'Rose', 'McGowan', 'gorgeous', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'describe', 'Alas', 'though', 'character', 'Debbie', 'Strand', 'not', 'perfect', 'tendency', 'fall', 'madly', 'love', 'stalk', 'school', 'teacher', 'time', 'time', 'not', 'stealing', 'just', 'deliciously', 'vindictive', 'jealous', 'well', 'evil', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'also', 'people', 'sometimes', 'not', 'fault', 'though', 'childhood', 'was', 'not', 'happy', 'one', 'when', 'first', 'meet', 'house', 'just', 'burned', 'down', 'mother', 'one', 'teachers', 'Off', 'grandmother', 'house', 'new', 'environment', 'frankly', 'just', ""n't"", 'suit', 'meet', 'needs', 'Grandma', 'apparently', 'related', 'blood', 'Carrie', 'White', 'mother', 'puritanical', 'woman', 'determined', 'turn', 'Debbie', 'good', 'Christian', 'girl', 'even', 'beat', 'devil', 'do', 'rest', 'pretty', 'simple', 'flirtation', 'young', 'Mr.', 'Rinaldi', 'quickly', 'kind', 'obsession', 'trail', 'bodies', 'wake', 'predictable', 'ending', 'something', 'let-down', 'most', 'part', 'darn', 'good', 'movie.Some', 'peripheral', 'characters', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'building', 'up', 'especially', 'detectives', 'investigating', 'big', 'fire', 'slowly', 'putting', 'two', 'two', 'together', 'hard', 'take', 'two', 'guys', 'seriously', 'when', 'do', 'quiz', 'other', 'spellings', 'definitions', 'difficult', 'words', 'Really', 'though', 'movie', 'down', 'two', 'characters', 'do', 'get', 'know', 'pretty', 'well', 'fact', 'Rinaldi', 'can', 'resist', 'Debbie', 'increasingly', 'forward', 'advances', 'sort', 'superman', 'incredible', 'fool', 'Debbie', 'get', 'pretty', 'good', 'handle', 'early', 'long', 'learn', 'secrets', 'secrets', 'unfriendly', 'reaction', 'certain', 'people', 'actually', 'make', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'sorts', 'story', 'sort', 'plays', 'loose', 'early', 'once', 'climactic', 'buildup', 'conclusion', 'forming', 'story', 'obsession', 'love', 'derangement', 'shifts', 'overdrive', 'down', 'cinematic', 'curves', 'leave', 'screaming', 'excitement', 'imminent', 'danger', 'always', 'there', 'front', 'eyes', 'Take', 'away', 'stupid', 'vocabulary', 'quizzes', 'two', 'detectives', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'given', 'film', 'five', 'stars', 'Even', 'were', 'worst', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'worth', 'watching', 'just', 'Rose', 'McGowan', 'simply', 'stunning', 'motion', 'picture', 'exhibiting', 'acting', 'skills', 'nearly', 'approximate', 'depth', 'unique', 'beauty', 'Believe', 'evil', 'never', 'looked', 'so', 'good']",N/A

Too bad the rest of the movie doesn't measure up.Plot: after some nastiness at her old school, Debbie Strand (McGowan, recently of the Conan the Barbarian remake) is sent by the state's foster care system to live with her grandmother (Imitation of Life's Peg Shirley). No sweat, she thinks, until she finds out the grandmother is a crazy religious nut who expects Debbie to be her personal slave girl. Worse, she's also got a couple of detectives (Wag the Dog's Phil Morris and Gigli's Robert Silver) nosing around trying to figure out what happened at her former school. All that fades into the background, though, when she sets eyes on hunky Peter Rinaldi (Conspiracy Theory's Alex McArthur), an English teacher at her new school. Debbie sets her sights on Peter, and god help anyone who gets in her way...To put it simply: this is ridiculous. The script tries to marry horror story with teen sex comedy and does neither with any competence. The acting is baseline, but barely that; given the talent assembled for this movie, I have to give director Steve Cohen grudging respect for being enough of a director to get this entire cast to act this badly. And the erotic aspects of the script are... well, nonexistent would be the best way to describe them.Unless you're a huge fan of someone who was involved in this production (I watched it solely because of Wendy Robie, who was in it for far too little time), you should not only pass it up, but flee screaming in terror. *",1,The Badly-Acted Seed,1364601600,"03 30, 2013",2013,1931,"['Devil', 'Flesh', 'Steven', 'Cohen', '1998', 'whole', 'erotic', 'thriller', 'thing', 'movie', 'one', 'pearl', 'thousand', 'swine', 'Not', 'studios', 'pumping', 'M', 'Ms', 'late', 'nineties', 'were', 'especially', 'fertile', 'breeding', 'ground', 'erotic', 'thriller', 'pretty', 'much', 'were', 'awful', 'Case', 'point', 'Devil', 'Flesh', 'only', 'selling', 'point', 'days', 'nubile', 'Rose', 'McGowan', 'looking', 'quite', 'delectable', 'Too', 'bad', 'rest', 'movie', ""n't"", 'measure', 'up.Plot', 'nastiness', 'old', 'school', 'Debbie', 'Strand', 'McGowan', 'recently', 'Conan', 'Barbarian', 'remake', 'sent', 'state', 'foster', 'care', 'system', 'live', 'grandmother', 'Imitation', 'Life', 'Peg', 'Shirley', 'sweat', 'out', 'grandmother', 'crazy', 'religious', 'nut', 'who', 'Debbie', 'be', 'personal', 'slave', 'girl', 'Worse', 'also', 'got', 'couple', 'detectives', 'Dog', 'Phil', 'Morris', 'Gigli', 'Robert', 'Silver', 'nosing', 'around', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'former', 'school', 'background', 'though', 'when', 'eyes', 'hunky', 'Peter', 'Rinaldi', 'Conspiracy', 'Theory', 'Alex', 'McArthur', 'English', 'teacher', 'new', 'school', 'Debbie', 'sights', 'Peter', 'god', 'help', 'anyone', 'who', 'way', 'put', 'simply', 'ridiculous', 'script', 'marry', 'horror', 'story', 'teen', 'sex', 'comedy', 'competence', 'acting', 'baseline', 'barely', 'given', 'talent', 'assembled', 'movie', 'have', 'give', 'director', 'Steve', 'Cohen', 'grudging', 'respect', 'being', 'enough', 'director', 'get', 'entire', 'cast', 'act', 'badly', 'erotic', 'aspects', 'script', 'are', 'well', 'nonexistent', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'way', 'describe', 'them.Unless', ""'re"", 'huge', 'fan', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'involved', 'production', 'watched', 'solely', 'Wendy', 'Robie', 'who', 'was', 'far', 'too', 'little', 'time', 'should', 'not', 'only', 'pass', 'up', 'flee', 'screaming', 'terror', '*']",N/A
