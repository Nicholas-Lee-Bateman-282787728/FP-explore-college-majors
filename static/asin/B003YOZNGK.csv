The plots are often exciting enough for parents, but there is no violence or bad language so kids can enjoy the films as well.  In my animal loving household, our favorite movies always include some kind of four legged friend. So I knew before ever seeing ""Some Lucky Dog"" that it was going to be a winner with us. And I wasn't disappointed  all.""Some Lucky Dog""  tells the story of a woman named Lisa who returns to the small town she grew up in, and learns that her family's ranch is struggling to stay afloat. In her efforts to help, she adopts a shelter dog named ""Lucky"" to help out at the ranch. But Lucky does way more than save the ranch. He saves lives and brings the whole community together in an endearing tale of bravery and courageousness.""You Lucky Dog"" stars Harry Hamlin and Natasha Henstridge, who both give a five star performance. Its a great movie that teaches the importance of family and community and of second chances.  I also love that it encourages people to think about adopting shelter dogs because there are so many out there that need a good home. Its a wonderful family film, and everyone in my household really enjoyed watching it. Make sure you have a box of tissues because you will get a little teary eyed.
