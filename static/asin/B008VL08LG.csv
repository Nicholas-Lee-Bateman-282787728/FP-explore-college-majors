Most of them run for less than half an hour, and each is narrated by a speaker with fine professional qualifications.  The real draw is the story, and the slides or animation add visual interest.  Most of the stories are fairly close to the originals we remember from childhood and such alterations as there are add interest and entertainment.  We recommend all of them and suggest sharing them with your children and grandchildren, especially because the younger ones have often not read or encountered the stories.Because they are short and hold one's interest, try one and you'll be hooked, unless you are happen to be an old curmudgeon.This one is close to Washington Irving's Legend of Sleepy Hollow, which is at some variance with the TV series Sleepy Hollow.",5,The real back story of Sleepy Hollow,1399334400,"05 6, 2014",2014,831,"['have', 'watched', 'several', 'Rabbit', 'Ears', 'Entertainment', 'series', 'Most', 'run', 'less', 'hour', 'narrated', 'speaker', 'fine', 'professional', 'qualifications', 'real', 'draw', 'story', 'slides', 'animation', 'add', 'visual', 'interest', 'Most', 'stories', 'are', 'fairly', 'close', 'originals', 'remember', 'childhood', 'such', 'alterations', 'are', 'add', 'interest', 'entertainment', 'recommend', 'suggest', 'sharing', 'children', 'grandchildren', 'especially', 'younger', 'ones', 'have', 'often', 'not', 'read', 'encountered', 'stories.Because', 'are', 'short', 'hold', 'one', 'interest', 'try', 'one', ""'ll"", 'be', 'hooked', 'are', 'happen', 'be', 'old', 'curmudgeon.This', 'one', 'close', 'Washington', 'Irving', 'Legend', 'Sleepy', 'Hollow', 'variance', 'TV', 'series', 'Sleepy', 'Hollow']",N/A

I hadn't realized it when watching her in the movies all these years, but her voice is thoroughly amazing in tone and clarity. It would be a pleasure to listen to anything she read as she brings her considerable acting know-how to a piece of literature. This story is very well-done by Ms. Close and will hopefully inspire younger generations to delve into the classics. The illustrations are gently animated and lovely to watch. The entire piece moves at a pace that is appropriate for grade school children and could also serve as an inspiration for people trying their hand at animating their art with software.",5,"Glenn Close's Absolutely Mesmerizing, Beautiful Voice Brings this Well-Known Ghost Story to Life",1383436800,"11 3, 2013",2013,661,"['Glenn', 'Close', 'sweet', 'bell-like', 'voice', 'had', ""n't"", 'realized', 'when', 'watching', 'movies', 'years', 'voice', 'thoroughly', 'amazing', 'tone', 'clarity', 'would', 'be', 'pleasure', 'listen', 'anything', 'read', 'considerable', 'acting', 'know-how', 'piece', 'literature', 'story', 'very', 'well-done', 'Ms.', 'Close', 'will', 'hopefully', 'inspire', 'younger', 'generations', 'delve', 'classics', 'illustrations', 'are', 'gently', 'animated', 'lovely', 'watch', 'entire', 'piece', 'moves', 'pace', 'appropriate', 'grade', 'school', 'children', 'could', 'also', 'serve', 'inspiration', 'people', 'trying', 'hand', 'animating', 'art', 'software']",N/A

I thought it would be more animated but it was still a well narrated story by one of my favorite actresses. Plus, I wanted to relive a classic in classic form because I forgot the original ending. Also because it reminded me of the first time I heard it. I was in the second or third grade and we had substitute teacher this particular day. He decided to read the story to us and I thought from the description of Icabod Crane that he was describing himself. The man was the same height and build as the character. He even had a pointy nose. The only differences were the teacher was African American, had an Afro and wore glasses but the description had us all saying the same thing, &#34;He's talking about himself.&#34; If you're wondering how we could have thought that about him, he knew the story by heart....or at least a majority of it. *wink* Enjoy!!!",4,Not what I expected.....,1367625600,"05 4, 2013",2013,911,"['Glenn', 'Close', 'narrating', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'animated', 'was', 'still', 'well', 'narrated', 'story', 'one', 'favorite', 'actresses', 'wanted', 'relive', 'classic', 'classic', 'form', 'forgot', 'original', 'ending', 'Also', 'reminded', 'first', 'time', 'heard', 'was', 'second', 'third', 'grade', 'had', 'substitute', 'teacher', 'particular', 'day', 'decided', 'read', 'story', 'thought', 'description', 'Icabod', 'Crane', 'was', 'describing', 'man', 'was', 'same', 'height', 'build', 'character', 'even', 'had', 'pointy', 'nose', 'only', 'differences', 'were', 'teacher', 'was', 'African', 'American', 'had', 'Afro', 'wore', 'glasses', 'description', 'had', 'saying', 'same', 'thing', '34', 'talking', 'himself.', '34', ""'re"", 'wondering', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'thought', 'knew', 'story', 'heart', '.or', 'least', 'majority', '*wink*', 'Enjoy']",N/A
