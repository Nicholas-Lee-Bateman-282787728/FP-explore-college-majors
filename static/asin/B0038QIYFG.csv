This is to warn people who care about such things that Funimation is flat out lying on their DVD boxes. They claim that the DVD is 16:9 and it is not, it's 4:3 widescreen. Instead of filling the entire screen or even having black bars on the top and bottom, I have black bars on all four sides of the screen and it makes it useless to watch this on a large TV. I never would've bought this if I had known what was in store for me after I popped it into my player.",1,Blech!,1273968000,"05 16, 2010",2010,530,"['not', 'condemnation', 'movie', 'fantastic', 'warn', 'people', 'who', 'care', 'such', 'things', 'Funimation', 'flat', 'out', 'lying', 'DVD', 'boxes', 'claim', 'DVD', '16:9', 'not', '4:3', 'widescreen', 'Instead', 'filling', 'entire', 'screen', 'even', 'having', 'black', 'bars', 'top', 'bottom', 'have', 'black', 'bars', 'four', 'sides', 'screen', 'useless', 'watch', 'large', 'TV', 'never', 'would', ""'ve"", 'bought', 'had', 'known', 'what', 'was', 'store', 'popped', 'player']",N/A
1332985,A2ITK2O7YK8RNN,B0038QIYFG,"Kenneth Chu ""SincereAgape""","[0, 0]","Stage 3 of Initial D does justice to the series.Many Anime movies are always different from the main plotline of the series and that is why they somewhat fall short of the expectations of the fans.The Initial D motion picture does not follow this trend.  Stage 3 builds off the first two seasons of the anime with an excellent sense of style and flair.  The animation is crip and clean, and the voice acting from both the Japanese and the Funimation dubbed is top rate.The story once again revolves around Takumi.  Takumi and Itsuki are about to graduate high school and must make major decisions in their lives from here on out.  The movie focuses a lot on the romantic relationship Takumi has with Natsuki.  At the beginning of the movie Takumi is upset at Natsuki from events that had occured in the first two seasons of the anime.  Their relationship builds and hits a climax through the film.Another side plot is Ryosuke Takahashi asking Takumi to join a special racing team that would travel throughout Japan to challenge other racers (Leads into Stage 4).Takumi must make a decision on whether or not he is interested in joining this team, what to do with his relationship with Natsuki, and venture into his inner soul to determine what exactly makes him who he is.During the movie Takumi encounteres racing challenges from various foes. Including the son of his father's rival.  Takumi also has his rematch with Kyochui Sudo toward the beginning of the movie.Everyone makes a cameo in the film that were in the previous two seasons....Kesiuke, Kenta, Shinjo, Itsuki, Kenji, Iketani, Nakazato, Seji, Kyochui Sudo, and of course Mako and Sayuki.The soundtrack for the film is above average, the animation is crips and clean, the character development is fantastic.  There is romance.  There is style and substance (Minor details like Sudo's tinted windows).If you enjoy Initial D buy this movie and enjoy it.  It is a continuation from Stage 1 and Stage 2.All of my favorite scenes in the movie involve Natsumi and Takumi....and the best one involves BUNTA!!!",5,Loved It.,1307750400,"06 11, 2011",2011,2065,"['Stage', '3', 'Initial', 'D', 'justice', 'series.Many', 'Anime', 'movies', 'are', 'always', 'different', 'main', 'plotline', 'series', 'why', 'somewhat', 'fall', 'short', 'expectations', 'fans.The', 'Initial', 'D', 'motion', 'picture', 'not', 'follow', 'trend', 'Stage', '3', 'builds', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'anime', 'excellent', 'sense', 'style', 'flair', 'animation', 'crip', 'clean', 'voice', 'acting', 'Japanese', 'Funimation', 'dubbed', 'top', 'rate.The', 'story', 'once', 'again', 'Takumi', 'Takumi', 'Itsuki', 'are', 'graduate', 'high', 'school', 'must', 'make', 'major', 'decisions', 'lives', 'here', 'out', 'movie', 'lot', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'Takumi', 'Natsuki', 'beginning', 'movie', 'Takumi', 'upset', 'Natsuki', 'events', 'had', 'occured', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'anime', 'relationship', 'builds', 'climax', 'film.Another', 'side', 'plot', 'Ryosuke', 'Takahashi', 'asking', 'Takumi', 'join', 'special', 'racing', 'team', 'would', 'travel', 'Japan', 'challenge', 'other', 'racers', 'Leads', 'Stage', '4', '.Takumi', 'must', 'make', 'decision', 'not', 'interested', 'joining', 'team', 'what', 'do', 'relationship', 'Natsuki', 'venture', 'inner', 'soul', 'determine', 'what', 'exactly', 'who', 'is.During', 'movie', 'Takumi', 'racing', 'challenges', 'various', 'foes', 'Including', 'son', 'father', 'rival', 'Takumi', 'also', 'rematch', 'Kyochui', 'Sudo', 'beginning', 'movie.Everyone', 'cameo', 'film', 'were', 'previous', 'two', 'seasons', '.Kesiuke', 'Kenta', 'Shinjo', 'Itsuki', 'Kenji', 'Iketani', 'Nakazato', 'Seji', 'Kyochui', 'Sudo', 'course', 'Mako', 'Sayuki.The', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'above', 'average', 'animation', 'crips', 'clean', 'character', 'development', 'fantastic', 'romance', 'style', 'substance', 'Minor', 'details', 'Sudo', 'tinted', 'windows', '.If', 'enjoy', 'Initial', 'D', 'buy', 'movie', 'enjoy', 'continuation', 'Stage', '1', 'Stage', '2.All', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'movie', 'involve', 'Natsumi', 'Takumi', '.and', 'best', 'one', 'BUNTA']",N/A
1332986,AFZGZTMGACBQO,B0038QIYFG,Paul Vincent,"[0, 1]","Initial D: 3rd stage is finally available on Region 1 DVD with subtitles. Story is great, but the picture quality is somewhat dissapointing; fine dust/hair particles are present every so often, the whole picture is a little too dark with muted colors, and the sharpness is not what it could be. I don't think I've ever seen a version of 3rd stage that was bright enough though. The audio was fine except for the English Dub which I did not care for it at all - could only stand 3 lines dubbed before stopping the movie and restarting in Japanese audio with English subtitles (which I've always watched Initial D in anyways, just was curious how the English dub was; ranks right along with ToykoPop's dubbing for 1st and 2nd stages...) There were a few errors in the subtitles (eg: I'm pretty sure the 20 valve 4-AGE in Takumi's AE-86 spins higher than ""1,100 rpm"") - doesn't seem the subtitling was proof checked thoroughly enough.I still enjoyed this Initial D: 3rd stage release very much even with the lackluster video quality...it still had a nice ""movie"" like presentation quality that is hard to describe, but worked.Lows: Video has quality issues (dark image, dust/hair visible, image sharpness - more like VHS quality) and English dubbing still not right for the seriesHighs: Story still really good, audio is very good, there is a nice ""movie"" feel to it.Recommended for Initial D fans, but realize the video quality is more like that of a VHS tape than DVD.",3,Really good Initial D Movie...Not good video quality.,1273968000,"05 16, 2010",2010,1467,"['Initial', 'D', '3rd', 'stage', 'finally', 'available', 'Region', '1', 'DVD', 'subtitles', 'Story', 'great', 'picture', 'quality', 'somewhat', 'dissapointing', 'fine', 'dust/hair', 'particles', 'are', 'present', 'so', 'often', 'whole', 'picture', 'little', 'too', 'dark', 'muted', 'colors', 'sharpness', 'not', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'version', '3rd', 'stage', 'was', 'bright', 'enough', 'audio', 'was', 'fine', 'English', 'Dub', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'could', 'only', 'stand', '3', 'lines', 'dubbed', 'stopping', 'movie', 'restarting', 'Japanese', 'audio', 'English', 'subtitles', ""'ve"", 'always', 'watched', 'Initial', 'D', 'anyways', 'just', 'was', 'curious', 'how', 'English', 'dub', 'was', 'ranks', 'right', 'ToykoPop', 'dubbing', '1st', '2nd', 'stages', 'were', 'few', 'errors', 'subtitles', 'eg', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', '20', 'valve', '4-AGE', 'Takumi', 'AE-86', 'spins', 'higher', '1,100', 'rpm', ""n't"", 'seem', 'subtitling', 'was', 'proof', 'checked', 'thoroughly', 'enough.I', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'Initial', 'D', '3rd', 'stage', 'release', 'very', 'much', 'even', 'lackluster', 'video', 'quality', 'still', 'had', 'nice', 'movie', 'presentation', 'quality', 'hard', 'describe', 'Video', 'quality', 'issues', 'dark', 'image', 'dust/hair', 'visible', 'image', 'sharpness', 'more', 'VHS', 'quality', 'English', 'dubbing', 'still', 'not', 'right', 'seriesHighs', 'Story', 'still', 'really', 'good', 'audio', 'very', 'good', 'nice', 'movie', 'feel', 'it.Recommended', 'Initial', 'D', 'fans', 'realize', 'video', 'quality', 'more', 'VHS', 'tape', 'DVD']",N/A
