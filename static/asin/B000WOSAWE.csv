1111036,A3ANETCTMAN1NP,B000WOSAWE,&#308;&#308;,"[6, 6]","Having bought the other two DVDs in this series and being extremely pleased with them, I ordered this video expecting a lot.  It has lived up to my high expectations, and although I don't love all five workouts, they are all different and good enough to give this DVD 5 stars.  These are the five workouts on the DVD.Cardio Party w/ Rob Glick-This section is kind of a dancey, aerobic routine.  What Rob does is he teaches you three different little dance routines that consist of mambos, V-steps, and more.  At the end, he puts all three routines together for a really fun and slightly challenging routine.  Although it isn't extremely challenging cardio wise, it is a little hard to remember some of Rob's choreography in the third routine because at the last minute he mixes it up.Cardio Kick-Butt w/ Violet Zaki-This is kind of a kickbox inspired workout.  It has fighting moves that are a lot of fun and that aren't in most kickbox workouts.  Yes, you could say that there are only two actual kicks taught (front and back), but there is a lot of other fun stuff such as karate chops, football runs, and elbow jabs.  Another thing that Violet does a lot of is squats.  At the end of this workout, my thighs were already sore from the squats.  However, it never got boring.  This is just a fun, kickbox-style, high-cardio routine with a lot of squats mixed in.Cardio Expresso w/ Gay Gasper-This section consists of about three routines that are made up of cardio moves such as grapevines,knee repeaters, and step touches.  This was kind of like Rob's routine only it was easier to follow and not as dancey.  It does contain a few dance moves, howover, making it a good medium.  This section is very cardio, and some exercisers will like it because of its mostly basic moves.Power Within w/ Kimberly Spreen-I was very disappointed with this section as it was interval training instead of constant cardio.  However, I loved Kimberly.  She was so genuine and sweet that she made the section fun.  It consists of about 1/3 toning that does not require weights.  It is mostly squats and lunges.  Then the rest is high cardio bursts that don't last too long, but are extremely high cardio.  Some examples would be skaters and leaps.  Although, I wasn't too pleased with this style, Kimberly made me enjoy this workout.Peak Performance w/ Kendell Hogan-This section was more of a straight forward, sports-style routine.  The moves are such as shooting a basketball and knee lifts with a hop.  This was my favorite section, and Kendell was a very good trainer, as he always is.  This section is one routine that Kendell is constantly adding onto.  It is a lot of fun, and it is high cardio.All workouts contain a short warm-up and cool down that are really nice.  They also all contain water breaks at about the 20 minute point.  Some people complained about this, as it does interrupt the workout, but I just fast-forward through them.  Altogether this is a great DVD with 5 workouts of various cardio styles.  It is a great DVD that I recommend to all.",5,Enought variety that all should like!,1266364800,"02 17, 2010",2010,3049,"['Having', 'bought', 'other', 'two', 'DVDs', 'series', 'being', 'extremely', 'pleased', 'ordered', 'video', 'expecting', 'lot', 'lived', 'up', 'high', 'expectations', 'do', ""n't"", 'love', 'five', 'workouts', 'are', 'different', 'good', 'enough', 'give', 'DVD', '5', 'stars', 'are', 'five', 'workouts', 'DVD.Cardio', 'Party', 'w/', 'Rob', 'Glick-This', 'section', 'kind', 'dancey', 'aerobic', 'routine', 'What', 'Rob', 'three', 'different', 'little', 'dance', 'routines', 'consist', 'mambos', 'V-steps', 'more', 'end', 'three', 'routines', 'together', 'really', 'fun', 'slightly', 'challenging', 'routine', ""n't"", 'extremely', 'challenging', 'cardio', 'wise', 'little', 'hard', 'remember', 'Rob', 'choreography', 'third', 'routine', 'last', 'minute', 'mixes', 'up.Cardio', 'Kick-Butt', 'w/', 'Violet', 'Zaki-This', 'kind', 'kickbox', 'inspired', 'workout', 'fighting', 'moves', 'are', 'lot', 'fun', 'are', ""n't"", 'most', 'kickbox', 'workouts', 'Yes', 'could', 'say', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'actual', 'kicks', 'taught', 'front', 'back', 'lot', 'other', 'fun', 'stuff', 'such', 'karate', 'chops', 'football', 'runs', 'elbow', 'jabs', 'thing', 'Violet', 'lot', 'squats', 'end', 'workout', 'thighs', 'were', 'already', 'sore', 'squats', 'However', 'never', 'got', 'boring', 'just', 'fun', 'kickbox-style', 'high-cardio', 'routine', 'lot', 'squats', 'mixed', 'in.Cardio', 'Expresso', 'w/', 'Gay', 'Gasper-This', 'section', 'three', 'routines', 'are', 'made', 'cardio', 'moves', 'such', 'grapevines', 'knee', 'repeaters', 'step', 'touches', 'was', 'kind', 'Rob', 'routine', 'only', 'was', 'easier', 'follow', 'not', 'dancey', 'contain', 'few', 'dance', 'moves', 'howover', 'making', 'good', 'medium', 'section', 'very', 'cardio', 'exercisers', 'will', 'like', 'mostly', 'basic', 'moves.Power', 'Within', 'w/', 'Kimberly', 'Spreen-I', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'section', 'was', 'interval', 'training', 'instead', 'constant', 'cardio', 'However', 'loved', 'Kimberly', 'was', 'so', 'genuine', 'sweet', 'made', 'section', 'fun', '1/3', 'toning', 'not', 'require', 'weights', 'mostly', 'squats', 'lunges', 'Then', 'rest', 'high', 'cardio', 'bursts', 'do', ""n't"", 'last', 'too', 'long', 'are', 'extremely', 'high', 'cardio', 'examples', 'would', 'be', 'skaters', 'leaps', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'pleased', 'style', 'Kimberly', 'made', 'enjoy', 'workout.Peak', 'Performance', 'w/', 'Kendell', 'Hogan-This', 'section', 'was', 'more', 'straight', 'forward', 'sports-style', 'routine', 'moves', 'are', 'such', 'shooting', 'basketball', 'knee', 'lifts', 'hop', 'was', 'favorite', 'section', 'Kendell', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'trainer', 'always', 'section', 'one', 'routine', 'Kendell', 'constantly', 'adding', 'lot', 'fun', 'high', 'cardio.All', 'workouts', 'contain', 'short', 'warm-up', 'cool', 'down', 'are', 'really', 'nice', 'also', 'contain', 'water', 'breaks', '20', 'minute', 'point', 'people', 'complained', 'interrupt', 'workout', 'just', 'fast-forward', 'Altogether', 'great', 'DVD', '5', 'workouts', 'various', 'cardio', 'styles', 'great', 'DVD', 'recommend']",Star Trainers: Cardio

While we live in an age of advertisements, it is beyond comprehensible for a company to insist that before each workout the instructor must mention to ""bring your Propel"" and get ready to workout.  And then to top it off, each workout is stopped for a Propel water break, in which the instructor and the people working out behind him or her, explicitly show that they are drinking the branded water!  The camera even zooms in on the water bottles before they are picked up from the floor!  If anything, we should all ban Propel for pushing this onto a DVD we have purchased.  Banning companies that cross the line may be the only way to get through to them, and hopefully stop this practice in its tracks.

I don't have to do the same workout or see the same trainer day in and day out - that really beats my biggest problem - boredom.All of the trainers are fun and most of the workouts have one person (there are 4 in the background) doing a lower impact version of the moves.

Violet Zaki's kickboxing/martial arts will sneak in some toning, and the cardio bursts in Kimberly and Kendall's workouts will get you some added burn.  Rob Glick's workout is a bit more challenging as far as choreography, but not overly demanding physically, and Gay Gasper's is good, old fashioned aerobics.  You can't go wrong here.

They cue well and get you motivated.  After advertising their prefered brand of water (Propell), they go straight into it.  One of the five exercisers usually has a calorie burner moniter on, and at the end of the workout, you find out how much they burned during the workout and you'll know you roughly got the same.  The music is great and the set is nice and hip.Each of the five workouts are approximately 25 minutes in cardio (then there is a warmup and cool down).  There is kickboxing, dancy combos, grapevines, shuffles and mixes of low and high impact to name a few.  I love how you can mix the workouts up so you'll never get bored, and while some are a little tricky to follow, it's fun trying to get there and improve on your last try.You don't need any equipment for these routines and they really are so much fun.

This is a decent DVD, some of the workouts are harder than others, just as some of the instructors are better at cueing than others.  All are around 30 min. so it's a decent amount of time and I don't need to add another workout to get a good calorie burn (I wear a HRM).  I never, ever burn the amount of calories the person on the DVD that is wearing a HRM gets and I usually keep up with them doing the advanced moves.  Most of the instructors use pretty basic moves that are easy to follow, Rob Glick is the most complicated and way too dancy for me and I wasn't crazy about his cueing.  Violet Zaki's workout is based on karate, which was new to me and I much prefer kick boxing but it was fun to do something different.  Most of them have either no or a very short warmup and cooldown, which is a problem for me so I usually add a good stretch when I'm finished.
