Watching them now I can see that a lot of it went right over my tousled head.  The shows vary in quality but even the worst of them is still good and the best are brilliant.  ""Salute to Television"" is still funny despite the dated references. The one in Vol 2 where the gang respond to a dismissive New Yorker review is wonderful.  Likewise their version of ""Destination Moon"" (as a musical no less).  My only complaint is that they don't have the one where Beulah Witch gets in trouble with the FAA.  The style might be described as ""banter"" since most of it is ad lib dialogue between the characters.  There was no actual script and each episode had only a general story arc with the details filled in as they went along, mostly by Burr Tilstrom helped by Fran Allison.  This is kind of high wire act is great to watch and the results are often amazingly good.",5,Adult Viewing Disguised as a Kid Show,1402012800,"06 6, 2014",2014,952,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'shows', '50', 'was', 'very', 'young', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'much', 'Watching', 'now', 'can', 'see', 'lot', 'went', 'right', 'tousled', 'head', 'shows', 'vary', 'quality', 'even', 'worst', 'still', 'good', 'best', 'are', 'brilliant', 'Salute', 'Television', 'still', 'funny', 'dated', 'references', 'one', 'Vol', '2', 'where', 'gang', 'respond', 'dismissive', 'New', 'Yorker', 'review', 'wonderful', 'Likewise', 'version', 'Destination', 'Moon', 'musical', 'less', 'only', 'complaint', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'one', 'where', 'Beulah', 'Witch', 'trouble', 'FAA', 'style', 'might', 'be', 'described', 'banter', 'most', 'ad', 'lib', 'dialogue', 'characters', 'was', 'actual', 'script', 'episode', 'had', 'only', 'general', 'story', 'arc', 'details', 'filled', 'went', 'along', 'mostly', 'Burr', 'Tilstrom', 'helped', 'Fran', 'Allison', 'kind', 'high', 'wire', 'act', 'great', 'watch', 'results', 'are', 'often', 'amazingly', 'good']","Kukla, Fran and Ollie - The First Episodes, Vol. 1"
