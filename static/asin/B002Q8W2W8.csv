While this definitely fit the bill for most of those things, it came up really short on comedy.  I now know why the title is what it is - you are being commanded to laugh even if it is not funny.

I enjoy stand-up comedy of all kinds, and I was intrigued by the promise of clean ""Christian comedy"" offered by this series.  This 90-minute program was shot live at a Texas church, so the production values are decent but not spectacular.As promised, the comedy was fit for the entire family.  My wife was anticipating Christian-themed acts, but only Michael, Jr. delivered Bible-inspired humor.  The acts were pleasantly varied, with a musician and ventriloquist/magician.  Unfortunately, the acts were largely hit or miss.  Joe Wong and Isaac Witty were simply not funny in my opinion, and the others were good but none left me rolling in the aisle.  John Tesh, meanwhile, was an affable host and an awkward, unfunny comedian as he demonstrated throughout.  Although teasing the audience with the possibility that he might perform a musical number, Tesh was largely absent during the program and, in the end, served little purpose other than name recognition for the box.If you are a fan of the series, you will probably get this volume regardless.  If you are new to the series, like me, you might want to start with an earlier volume, if all of those positive reviews are to be believed.",3,"Family friendly, but only moderately funny",1265932800,"02 12, 2010",2010,1348,"['was', 'first', 'volume', 'Thou', 'Shalt', 'Laugh', 'have', 'seen', 'was', 'impressed', 'enough', 'positive', 'reviews', 'previous', 'volumes', 'give', 'shot', 'enjoy', 'stand-up', 'comedy', 'kinds', 'was', 'intrigued', 'promise', 'clean', 'Christian', 'comedy', 'offered', 'series', '90-minute', 'program', 'was', 'shot', 'live', 'Texas', 'church', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'decent', 'not', 'spectacular.As', 'promised', 'comedy', 'was', 'fit', 'entire', 'family', 'wife', 'was', 'anticipating', 'Christian-themed', 'acts', 'only', 'Michael', 'Jr.', 'delivered', 'Bible-inspired', 'humor', 'acts', 'were', 'pleasantly', 'varied', 'musician', 'ventriloquist/magician', 'Unfortunately', 'acts', 'were', 'largely', 'hit', 'miss', 'Joe', 'Wong', 'Isaac', 'Witty', 'were', 'simply', 'not', 'funny', 'opinion', 'others', 'were', 'good', 'none', 'left', 'rolling', 'aisle', 'John', 'Tesh', 'meanwhile', 'was', 'affable', 'host', 'awkward', 'unfunny', 'comedian', 'demonstrated', 'teasing', 'audience', 'possibility', 'might', 'perform', 'musical', 'number', 'Tesh', 'was', 'largely', 'absent', 'program', 'end', 'served', 'little', 'purpose', 'other', 'name', 'recognition', 'box.If', 'are', 'fan', 'series', 'will', 'probably', 'get', 'volume', 'regardless', 'are', 'new', 'series', 'might', 'want', 'start', 'earlier', 'volume', 'positive', 'reviews', 'are', 'be', 'believed']",Thou Shalt Laugh 4

Hudson ""bisou bisou""","[1, 1]","Realizing that different people have different opinions on what is funny and what is not, I am rating this DVD as 4 stars for my own sense of humor, which tends to be somewhat wide-ranged from subtle to almost slap-stick.Three of the six comedians on this DVD really impressed me, especially Rex Havens, the lead-off one.  His bit about car names, men and women, and shoes was hilarious.  Joe Wong, the second presenter, had a few good lines, but his pace was way too slow - something he shared with many of the other comedians.  Dana Daniels, the magician/comedian, was a bit slow-paced, but his interaction with the people he volunteered from the audience was outstanding.  He was very quick with funny comebacks and his overall act was quite entertaining.  Michael Jr. was excellent in spots, but was not consistently funny (to me).  Isaac Witty did not keep my attention, so I'm not sure if that was my fault or his.  The last comedian on the DVD was Taylor Mason, a very talented ventriloquist/pianist with a high energy level who was the perfect choice for closing the show.Although there were several lines about Christians from a few of the comedians, the humor was not overtly Christian throughout.  My favorite one, Rex Havens, joked about everyday experiences that men and women have and elevated simple observations to hilarious insights.John Tesh did an outstanding job as MC.  His attempts at humor were well accepted by the audience and even made me smile.I enjoyed watching the DVD and plan to have it handy so I can view it the next time I need a good laugh.

Some of the comedians are downright odd and unfunny. The host, John Tesh, is the most well known of all of the people on the show appears the most out of place on the show as well. I love stand up, consider myself a devoted Christian, and I laughed out loud once the entire run of the show.Many of the jokes are forced or old material and the audience seems to laugh out of politeness, and other times simply don't laugh at all. When the jokes do become explicitly Christian they do alienate anyone who is not a fundamentalist or generic evangelical. For instance, one comedian jokes about James the ""brother of Jesus"" as if he were Jesus' blood brother, son of Mary. Most of Christendom would recognize that interpretation as an amateur violation of the biblical text.

It is very much  along the lines of old Ed Sullivan variety TV show. I had three generations of people watching it at one time and while the adults enjoyed it quite a bid, the teenage kids for the most part thought that it was pretty lame.Once again it was fun, but it seemed like even the producers were not quite sure of that. There are more than the usual number of cuts to the audience laughing. Braces joke = shot of a girl with braces, fat joke or ethnic joke = likewise. Yes there are tasteful ethnic jokes.The entire show takes place inside a church as we find out from one of the comedians. John Tesh does a very professional MC act, and even throws in a few jokes based on him growing up. Telling of these stories he describes as therapy, not as comedy.Here are my takes on the comedians:Rex Havens: ****. Very much in the style of George Carlin. In other words, he has fun with language and words, car names, women's shoes, etc. Very good with facial gestures.Joe Wong: **** Somewhat hard to understand with a thick Chinese accent, but he makes that a central point of his routine. Fitting in in Texas, becoming a citizen, becoming a father. Pretty good story teller.Dana Daniel's: ***** A BAD magician/animal trainer (he's a BIRD!). This as it turns out becomes his strength. Magic so bad that its really funny. After a slow start, he was the only one that made me laugh out loud. He does throw in some passing gas jokes though. Aaah.... the classics of comedy.Michael Jr: ***** If your church or civic group ever had an engaging motivational speaker, he was probably a lot like Michael Jr. He starts out describing his uncertainty with being Christian and evolves it into funny stories. What is  that fine line between being a non believer or too much of a believer? Michael explores it.Isaac Witty: ** I watched the entire act hoping it was going to become funny. For me it never did. Not many others in my group thought it was funny either.Taylor Mason: ****  A pretty good ventriloquist, especially with the stuffed pig. But no so much with the puppets, but still good.  At one point he has two large puppets have a pretty funny discussion with each other, but has some difficulty controlling both well. His simplest routines evoked the most laughs out of the audience. He is also a talented piano player, and he ends his act by drawing John Tesh into a piano duet with him. John's contribution turns out to very limited.So overall, while not quite Cosby and Reagan caliber, still good for quite a few laughs.Moreover a fine show that you would not be embarrassed to watch with the wife, kids, AND grandparents.",3,Thou Shall Laugh 4 - Fun FAMILY Comedy,1265500800,"02 7, 2010",2010,2740,"['Thou', 'Shall', 'Laugh', '4', 'Fun', 'FAMILY', 'Comedy.While', 'DVD', 'enjoyable', 'not', 'side', 'splitting', 'uproariously', 'funny', 'very', 'much', 'lines', 'old', 'Ed', 'Sullivan', 'variety', 'TV', 'show', 'had', 'three', 'generations', 'people', 'watching', 'one', 'time', 'adults', 'enjoyed', 'quite', 'bid', 'teenage', 'kids', 'most', 'part', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'lame.Once', 'again', 'was', 'fun', 'seemed', 'even', 'producers', 'were', 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'are', 'more', 'usual', 'number', 'cuts', 'audience', 'laughing', 'Braces', 'joke', '=', 'shot', 'girl', 'braces', 'fat', 'joke', 'ethnic', 'joke', '=', 'likewise', 'are', 'tasteful', 'ethnic', 'jokes.The', 'entire', 'show', 'place', 'church', 'find', 'out', 'one', 'comedians', 'John', 'Tesh', 'very', 'professional', 'MC', 'act', 'even', 'throws', 'few', 'jokes', 'based', 'growing', 'up', 'Telling', 'stories', 'therapy', 'not', 'comedy.Here', 'are', 'comedians', 'Rex', '****', 'Very', 'much', 'style', 'George', 'Carlin', 'other', 'words', 'fun', 'language', 'words', 'car', 'names', 'women', 'shoes', 'etc', 'Very', 'good', 'facial', 'gestures.Joe', 'Wong', '****', 'Somewhat', 'hard', 'understand', 'thick', 'Chinese', 'accent', 'central', 'point', 'routine', 'Fitting', 'Texas', 'becoming', 'citizen', 'becoming', 'father', 'Pretty', 'good', 'story', 'teller.Dana', 'Daniel', '*****', 'BAD', 'magician/animal', 'trainer', 'BIRD', 'out', 'becomes', 'strength', 'Magic', 'so', 'bad', 'really', 'funny', 'slow', 'start', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'made', 'out', 'loud', 'throw', 'passing', 'gas', 'jokes', 'Aaah', 'classics', 'comedy.Michael', 'Jr', '*****', 'church', 'civic', 'group', 'ever', 'had', 'engaging', 'motivational', 'speaker', 'was', 'probably', 'lot', 'Michael', 'Jr', 'out', 'describing', 'uncertainty', 'being', 'Christian', 'funny', 'stories', 'What', 'fine', 'line', 'being', 'non', 'believer', 'too', 'much', 'believer', 'Michael', 'it.Isaac', 'Witty', '**', 'watched', 'entire', 'act', 'hoping', 'was', 'going', 'become', 'funny', 'never', 'did', 'Not', 'many', 'others', 'group', 'thought', 'was', 'funny', 'either.Taylor', 'Mason', '****', 'A', 'pretty', 'good', 'ventriloquist', 'especially', 'stuffed', 'pig', 'so', 'much', 'puppets', 'still', 'good', 'one', 'point', 'two', 'large', 'puppets', 'have', 'pretty', 'funny', 'discussion', 'other', 'difficulty', 'controlling', 'well', 'simplest', 'routines', 'evoked', 'most', 'audience', 'also', 'talented', 'piano', 'player', 'act', 'drawing', 'John', 'Tesh', 'piano', 'duet', 'John', 'contribution', 'out', 'very', 'limited.So', 'overall', 'not', 'quite', 'Cosby', 'Reagan', 'caliber', 'still', 'good', 'quite', 'few', 'laughs.Moreover', 'fine', 'show', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'embarrassed', 'watch', 'wife', 'kids', 'grandparents']",Thou Shalt Laugh 4

1283601,A37DXIENIDHTVY,B002Q8W2W8,D. Wortham,"[0, 0]","When I decided to get this DVD I was a bit apprehensive since I hadn't seen any of the others in the series and it is billed as Christian comedy.The fact of the matter is it is easy to suck doing comedy and doing clean comedy seems to be very difficult - witness the tiny sliver of standup that you'd be comfortable watching with your grandmother. Right? Even fairly clean comedians have some very tasteless parts of their acts. It is frustrating if you'd like to share it/them with someone close with a similar sense of humor but the bad part(s) always drown out the very funny stuff before or after.So, thinking of Sinbad's special from a few years ago -Sinbad: Son of A Preacher Man- I went ahead and got this one.Really, very enjoyable! Not everyone was knockdown funny but all were good for some laughs and a few were funny all the way through. Joe Wong in particular was great and his type, or sense maybe, of comedy was dead on for me.Good clean humor. Even, for this venue, some risqu&eacute; stuff from one guy which kind of stuck out to me because it made me wonder how far it could go considering the Christian label. It didn't go far.

Besides, you can't watch it with the whole family.So A plus for the concept, but how's the execution?  Well, though it falls short of perfection,...it doesn't fall too short IMHO!John Tesh does a good job of emceeing, poking fun at himself and keeping his bits funny and SHORT, which is the key IMHO.  In addition the six comedians, two returnees and four rookies, provide a good mix of comedy styles.Up first is Rex Havens who has a hilarious bit poking fun at the peculiarity of car names if you stop to think about it, segueing into another good bit about the double standards applied to men and women in marriage.Second is Chinese immigrant to Texas Joe Wong who arguably provides the most uncommon viewpoint.  We've had lots of immigrant comedians commenting on the funny things about America from the newcomer's POV, but this is the first Chinese one I've seen.  He also provides the one clunker of a joke.  If he rewrote the punch line to ""The reason our convenience store no longer gets robbed?"" I'm sure he'd get a much bigger laugh.Third is Dana Daniels with a hilarious parody of an incompetent magician complete with ""trained"" bird and deliberately disastrous audience participation.Fourth is returnee Michael Jr., arguably both the most professional and the most overtly Christian, with a hilarious bit about ""creepy Christians"" or as he puts it, ""the Oversaved.""Fifth is Isaac Witty with several bits about his social awkwardness.  If the show had to be cut down to five, his is the act that I'd cut, not because it wasn't funny (it was), but because it was the least funny IMHO.Last is returnee Taylor Mason who does several hilarious ventriloquist bits, displaying astonishing skill at it.  He also works John Tesh into a funny piano bit at the end.Unfortunately, I must now confess to being well and truly hooked!

Some of the jokes are a bit dated, especially the ones from Rex Havens about all the different cars. At first I thought the DVD was made in 2009 but was filmed much earlier, until Rex made a few cracks about newer cars (Dodge Journey, Ford Focus) and even included a quip about President Obama. Taylor Mason also included a humorous sketch about a pig puppet with a face mask (obvious reference to the Mexican Swine Flu or H1N1) and added a joke about Vice President Joe Biden.I'd have to say Isaac Witty and Dana Daniels weren't the most funny, but they had their moments. Rex Havens had some knee slapping jokes, as did Michael Jr. Joe Wong had some great jokes but I didn't particularly enjoy his delivery. It seemed too wooden and slow. I can understand the desire to let the audience absorb the joke, but it was always 2-3 seconds more than what I felt was a comfortable pace.

My parents were visiting from Tennessee and they watched it along with me.It is difficult to find comedy presentations that my parents and I can watch together.

This one is hosted by John Tesh, former host of ""Entertainment Tonight.""  He introduces six comedians in the following order: Rex Havens, Joe Wong, Dana Daniels, Michael Jr., Isaac Witty and Taylor Mason.My favorite comedian is Rex Havens.  My family and I laughed non-stop through his entire routine, which consisted of two segments.  In the first, he pokes fun of automobile names.  He once owned a Plymouth Reliant; it made him more reliant on public transportation.  In the second segment, Rex describes how the wedding day is totally for the bride.  She doesn't even want the groom there.Joe Wong was hilarious with his immigrant jokes, especially the ones pertaining to his struggles to pass the citizenship test.  For example, one question on the test asked what was Roe versus Wade.  Joe answered that it was two ways for getting into this country.Dana Daniels had an adorable parrot whose ""psychic powers"" were uproarious.  Taylor Mason is famous for his ventriloquist dummies.  Isaac Witty is great as a dimwit who is rather slow.  Michael Jr. rolled me over when he recalled how a heckler at one of his performances had asked him why all black men looked alike.  He simply told the heckler that he needed to make the eye holes in his white sheet larger so he could see them more clearly.My only complaint with the DVD was the absence of subtitles for those of us who are hearing impaired.  However, the audio is loud and clear and the video looked great on my high definition television.

Traditionally, I have been a fan of the likes of Sam Kinison, Chris Rock, and Rodney Dangerfield, but I am fully aware that these acts are not for everyone and are certainly not appropriate for younger children.  I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical of the family comedy concept, but I popped in the DVD with an open mind.I was not completely disappointed in the video, but none of the comedians really gave me more than a few chuckles.  In my opinion, it seemed that the show was led off by their best comedians.I quite enjoyed Rex Havens' rant on marriage and his clever synopsis of cars.  Joe Wong's observational humor as seen through the eyes of a person ""new"" to America was priceless.  After these two acts, I thought the quality of the show went downhill.  As a matter of fact, I thought Dana Daniels and his parrot was the low point of the show.  With nowhere to go but up, Michael Jr. had a clever part of his act on the topic of religious friends.  Issac Witty was a close second when it came to the honor of being the low point of the video.  Even if I ignored his idiotic demeanor and terrible timing on his delivery, the part of his act about a church greeter with missing fingers really turned me off to him (not that the topic was taboo with me, it just was not funny).  The show wraps up with Taylor Mason, a seemingly talented ventriloquist, but I was not impressed with his act.John Tesh served as MC for the show.  Maybe my expectations were too high, but I expect a MC at a comedy show to be entertaining, tell a few jokes, or maybe tell a story or two.  He tried to do all of these, and I felt he did a very lackluster job of it.Comedians are like pizzas, they are a very personal thing and everyone has different tastes.  What one person thinks is great another person thinks is terrible.  This DVD is just like every comedy club show I have been to, some comedians are very good, a few are OK, and some are terrible.  Overall, while I would not call this DVD a waste of time, I was not overly impressed either.  If you are looking for something you wanted to sit down and watch with your 10+ year old kids, this might be worth checking out.  This is one of those videos that I would feel like I got ripped off if I paid full-price.

I loved comedy, but something went terribly wrong and we started getting a lot of comedians who couldn't be smart and funny in a clean way that was family friendly. Larry the cable guy and Ron White for example are 2 of the more well known comedians who are funny, but not suitable for the younger audience to watch.That's where this DVD comes in. While I didn't find all the comedians funny, and there were a few I thought were just down right annoying there was enough good humor to keep me entertained. I loved the magic of Dana Daniels with his bird sidekick. I've seen similar acts before but it's still enough to make you laugh out loud.Then there was Rex Havens who took the names of cars and really had a great act that had me rolling.Those were the 2 main comedians I enjoyed in this DVD, the others were entertaining and had some good jokes but Dana and Rex were what sealed it for me. The one thing I didn't like was at some parts I felt like I was being preached to by the comedians and I wasn't looking for that, I was instead looking for clean humor that was funny, that was it. That's why this lost one star. I understand the series is founded based on Christian beliefs by and for Christians and I have no issue with that, in fact I applaud that concept, but I think they over sell that to much and thus others might be turned away and it also loses some of the entertainment value because of that. Rex and Dana on the other hand don't even talk about the bible, they just have fun with magic and everyday items.Is it worth getting? It depends on the price. As of me writing this amazon has it on sale for $19.98, a price I personally would NEVER pay for this type of DVD. I could see paying as much as $15.00 but I think I would hold out until I could find it  for $10 or less. Honestly to me that's the value I would put on it. So if you like all these comedians it may be worth the full $20 price tag to you, if your like me and only a few acts really entertain you then you may want to buy it used or wait until amazon lowers the price of the new.",4,"Very funny, great clean family humor everyone can enjoy.",1265932800,"02 12, 2010",2010,2090,"['love', 'comedy', 'well', 'loved', 'comedy', 'something', 'went', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'started', 'getting', 'lot', 'comedians', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'smart', 'funny', 'clean', 'way', 'was', 'family', 'friendly', 'Larry', 'cable', 'guy', 'Ron', 'White', 'example', 'are', '2', 'more', 'well', 'known', 'comedians', 'who', 'are', 'funny', 'not', 'suitable', 'younger', 'audience', 'watch.That', 'where', 'DVD', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'comedians', 'funny', 'were', 'few', 'thought', 'were', 'just', 'down', 'right', 'annoying', 'there', 'was', 'enough', 'good', 'humor', 'keep', 'entertained', 'loved', 'magic', 'Dana', 'Daniels', 'bird', 'sidekick', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'similar', 'acts', 'still', 'enough', 'make', 'out', 'loud.Then', 'was', 'Rex', 'Havens', 'who', 'took', 'names', 'cars', 'really', 'had', 'great', 'act', 'had', 'rolling.Those', 'were', '2', 'main', 'comedians', 'enjoyed', 'DVD', 'others', 'were', 'entertaining', 'had', 'good', 'jokes', 'Dana', 'Rex', 'were', 'what', 'sealed', 'one', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'parts', 'felt', 'was', 'being', 'preached', 'comedians', 'was', ""n't"", 'looking', 'was', 'instead', 'looking', 'clean', 'humor', 'was', 'funny', 'was', 'why', 'lost', 'one', 'star', 'understand', 'series', 'founded', 'based', 'Christian', 'beliefs', 'Christians', 'have', 'issue', 'fact', 'applaud', 'concept', 'think', 'over', 'sell', 'much', 'thus', 'others', 'might', 'be', 'turned', 'away', 'also', 'entertainment', 'value', 'Rex', 'Dana', 'other', 'hand', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'talk', 'bible', 'just', 'have', 'fun', 'magic', 'everyday', 'items.Is', 'getting', 'price', 'writing', 'amazon', 'sale', '19.98', 'price', 'personally', 'would', 'NEVER', 'pay', 'type', 'DVD', 'could', 'see', 'paying', 'as', 'much', '15.00', 'think', 'would', 'hold', 'out', 'could', 'find', '10', 'less', 'Honestly', 'value', 'would', 'put', 'So', 'like', 'comedians', 'may', 'be', 'full', '20', 'price', 'tag', 'only', 'few', 'acts', 'really', 'entertain', 'then', 'may', 'want', 'buy', 'used', 'wait', 'amazon', 'lowers', 'price', 'new']",Thou Shalt Laugh 4

Six zinger comedians who all work clean perform together, each trying to outdo each other, so no matter who gets the best laugh, we all win.  If you've enjoyed the last three Thou Shalt Laugh videos, you'll continue enjoying this one.There's some new talent on board.  The opening act, Rex Havens, does rapid-fire banter and hilarious tongue twisters, and he's followed by Joe Wong, who does what many performers claim is impossible: he's funny in a second language.  These guys had me rolling on the floor.  I expect to see them become stars in the near future.And if you've liked Michael Jr. in the previous outings, let me tell you, this is the funniest I've ever seen him.  He still has his natural deadpan, but he seems to have more energy than he's had in the past.  His bit about Creepy Christians hits the audience right where we live, since we've all met these people.  He doesn't miss a trick.Not that everything is perfect.  The last couple of comedians didn't seem to bring their A game.  I don't mean that they aren't funny--I laughed at every single performer--but both of them sort of peter out.  And Taylor Mason, who is like Jeff Dunham for the clean comedy crowd, does so well, but ends on a predictable joke.But on the whole, this is a sharp, funny, worthy addition to the Thou Shalt Laugh tradition.

He plays the role of emcee quite well and even manages to get in a few laughs of his own.The comedians range from the seemingly new (Joe Wong) to the very experienced (Michael Jr.) and all make the crowd laugh in their own way.  Wong utilizes his ""fish out of water"" style to generate a number of decent laughs.  I'm particular fond of his explanation of the U.S. citizenship test.  Isaac Witty's performance is sub par, and I let out only a few mild chuckles at his performance.  Rex Havens uses a ""play on words"" technique that is funny, but drags on a bit too long.  Taylor Mason gives a very erratic performance that ranges from hilarious to completely dull at times.  Dana Daniels does some pretty good ""magic"" and gave the second best performance in my book.The kings of this DVD, however, were Michael Jr. and a brief segment of jokes told by audience members.

I've never cared for ""blue"" comedy and appreciate comedians that can get a laugh without having to try and shock the audience at the same time (although these days shock value seems harder and harder to come by). Overall, this DVD succeeds on that level, but I found the quality of the comedians to be of a mixed bag. I'd say of the 6, there were two I found pretty good, a couple just good, and the others not ones I'd watch again. Dana Daniels (comedy magic) was probably my favorite, but I've had a lot of experience with magic and comedy magic in particular and while he had some unique bits, a lot of it was still pretty old hat to me. John Tesh as a host was barely passable. He's a nice enough guy and certainly well known, but boy, when he tries to do comedy bits, it *really* falls flat and was by far the worst part of watching this. I also have to consider if this is a DVD I'd pay money for...would I watch it again? I don't think I would, it's really a one-time kind of watch for me, and thus a better rental prospect than something I'd consider buying to be able to watch more than once. It just doesn't rate as high as some other comedians for me, I think back to some of the great comedians of the past that I enjoy watching on DVD, even those before my time like Red Skelton and Victor Borge.

My neighbors are church goers and sensitive to profanity or any racy content, especially the 90-yo mother.Just about the only good thing I can say about this DVD is that it IS, in fact, profanity-free and pretty safe for the family.  The problem is, the family may not want to watch more than 10 minutes of it because it is just NOT funny.  John Tesh is charming as the host, but he should not have tried to be funny.  Painful!I used to go to The Improv on a regular basis, so I have seen a lot of comedians in my time.  The comedians on this DVD, though all male, were quite a diverse bunch otherwise (an African American, a Chinese American, a puppeteer, a (fake) magician, etc..).  The one thing they all had in common is that they weren't funny.  Sure, some were funnier than others.  Some were more experienced than others.Seeing that 50 of the reviewers of this DVD gave it 4- and 5-star reviews and raved about what drop-to-your-knees, gut-busting hilarity ensues, I thought it would be an enjoyable way to spend time with my neighbors.  Instead, it was awkward.  The elderly mother complained about every comic (until I finally turned it off) and the daughter tried her best to laugh to be polite...but finally, we all agreed that the funny wasn't happening and turned off the DVD.  We watched the entire performance of the first 3 comedians and then parts of one or two more.  After they left, I watched parts of the rest so that I could say I'd at least given each comic a try.I do not recommend this DVD unless you have low expectations.",2,Clean but painfully UNfunny,1272758400,"05 2, 2010",2010,1729,"['DVD', 'was', 'considered', 'Christian', 'comedy', 'family', 'friendly', 'asked', 'neighbor', 'mother', 'would', 'watch', 'always', 'find', 'comedy', 'funnier', 'company', 'neighbors', 'are', 'church', 'goers', 'sensitive', 'profanity', 'racy', 'content', 'especially', '90-yo', 'mother.Just', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'DVD', 'IS', 'fact', 'profanity-free', 'pretty', 'safe', 'family', 'problem', 'family', 'may', 'not', 'want', 'watch', 'more', '10', 'minutes', 'just', 'NOT', 'funny', 'John', 'Tesh', 'charming', 'host', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'tried', 'be', 'funny', 'Painful', 'used', 'go', 'Improv', 'regular', 'basis', 'so', 'have', 'seen', 'lot', 'comedians', 'time', 'comedians', 'DVD', 'male', 'were', 'quite', 'diverse', 'bunch', 'otherwise', 'African', 'American', 'Chinese', 'American', 'puppeteer', 'fake', 'magician', 'etc..', 'one', 'thing', 'had', 'common', 'were', ""n't"", 'funny', 'Sure', 'were', 'funnier', 'others', 'were', 'more', 'experienced', 'others.Seeing', '50', 'reviewers', 'DVD', 'gave', '4-', '5-star', 'reviews', 'raved', 'what', 'drop-to-your-knees', 'gut-busting', 'hilarity', 'ensues', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'way', 'spend', 'time', 'neighbors', 'Instead', 'was', 'awkward', 'elderly', 'mother', 'complained', 'comic', 'finally', 'turned', 'off', 'daughter', 'tried', 'best', 'laugh', 'be', 'polite', 'finally', 'agreed', 'funny', 'was', ""n't"", 'happening', 'turned', 'off', 'DVD', 'watched', 'entire', 'performance', 'first', '3', 'comedians', 'then', 'parts', 'one', 'two', 'more', 'left', 'watched', 'parts', 'rest', 'could', 'say', ""'d"", 'least', 'given', 'comic', 'try.I', 'do', 'not', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'have', 'low', 'expectations']",Thou Shalt Laugh 4

His props only added to the campyness of the skit.Michael Jr. saved the show almost single-handedly with his observations about Christianity, the Bible, and his job as a comedian.

Some of his jokes were very amusing even when thinking back on them later.Isaac Witty had this uncontrolled awkward laughter that ruined my enjoyment of what his random topics.

The use of profanity works for some comedians/comediennes, such as Eddie Murphy in his early years, Susie Essman (of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm""), or Kathy Griffin.  But the tendency has been for younger comedians to rely on profanity at the expense of laughs, figuring that a well-placed four-letter word enunciated with exaggerated emphasis as the punchline of a lame set-up would bring down the house.  This became tired very quickly.  The comedians on this DVD reminded me of the ones who used to show up regularly on ""The Ed Sullivan Show.""  Don't get me wrong.  Their routines are timely, but they derive from a tradition of family entertainment rather than smoky comedy clubs or Vegas stages.  I liked the variety here.  Rather than have six guys doing straight stand-up, there's use of puppets, a magician, and some nifty swinging piano accompanying the acts.  Isaac Witty reminded me of the great Jack Benny, as he pauses after a story, waiting for the laughs to increase (which they do!).  Rex Havens tackles a topic practically every comedian in history has explored -- marriage -- yet makes some genuinely funny and original observations about that noble institution.  Dana Daniels is terrific with his on-stage partner, Luigi the parrot.  It might have been interesting to have at least one female comedienne perform in order to get a woman's point-of-view on human foibles.  The true test of this DVD is:  Did it make me laugh?
