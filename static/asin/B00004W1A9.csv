Gregson,"[1, 1]","James Joyce's great novel &#34;Ulysses&#34; is not so much a good story with an interesting plot as it is a profound and often hilarious literary performance of enormous complexity. The novel simply cannot be filmed, but this is an interesting try at it. The director endeavors to bring in exact dialogue and some of the spirit of Joyce's text.  I would not recommend this film (or any film, for that matter) to students trying to pretend they have read the book for a college exam!

553258,A2BPDFR58H9575,B00004W1A9,Galina,"[2, 2]","I saw this film, the adaptation of James Joyce's most famous novel which is one of the most important and complex works of the 20th century literature, in the early 90s. The Videotape was on the shelf in the local library where I worked at the time. When I saw the title, I could not believe my eyes, and said to myself: ""This just can't happen because it is impossible."" But I held in my hands the evidence to the fact that the epitome of the unfilmable book had indeed been adapted to the screen. Even before I started watching, I was fascinated with audacity of the film's creators who were not afraid to aim a blow at the most famous literary ""stream of consciousness"" of the 20th century. The film left many parts of the books out and could not capture the whole realm of book's richness, it would be impossible, but the attempt still made me feel respect and appreciation to the film director/co-writer Joseph Strick and everyone involved for making an interesting and entertaining motion picture from the incredibly complex, versatile, polyphonic novel which is filled with the dizzying flight of thought, for which there is no limit in either space or time.What ""Ulysses""- the film did right, it is certainly a cinematic portrait of Dublin, James Joyce's city that lives, sounds and moves during a single day, known in literature as Bloomsday, June 16, 1904. Joyce once wrote that he wanted to describe Dublin in in such way that even in hundred years if the city disappears from the face of the earth, it could be restored based on the novel ""Ulysses"". Now, in addition to the Joyce's prose, there is a movie portrait of Joyce's Dublin carefully reproduced with its streets, avenues, harbor, docks, quays, pubs, the ""red lights"" district, cathedrals, cemetery, etc. I was very impressed by Milo O 'Shea in the role of Leopold Bloom. That's how I always imagined Bloom's appearance, body language, behavior, the whole persona.The best and most memorable are last two scenes of the film; a long surreal ""Circe"" depicting Bloom's and Stephen Daedalus visit to a brothel, and of course, the culmination of the film and the novel, 'Penelope'. Molly Bloom, Barbara Jefford, caught on a thin line between waking and dreaming just the moments before she falls asleep, thinks about very intimate events in her life, recent and long gone. She reminisces about her and Bloom's present and past and finally falls asleep with the most beautiful and life affirming thoughts ever captured in English language: ""...I was a Flower of the mountain yes when I put the rose in my hair like the Andalusian girls used or shall I wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the Moorish wall and I thought well as well him as another and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I will Yes."" Molly's inner monologue takes almost 30 minutes in the film but it is rich, playful, feminine, wave-like spiral and soothing. It is so beautiful, and Jefford made it her own yet relating to any viewer regardless of gender that I could listen to it again and again.In my opinion, ""Ulysses"" (1967) adapted by Joseph Strick is interesting, even if not completely successful film experiment, which was awarded the Oscar nomination for adapted screenplay. Incidentally, I have quite a seditious idea that ""Ulysses"" has been successfully transferred to the screen and the film has turned out amazingly captivating, entertaining and profound. He has another title and is the adaptation of another work of literature. I mean the posthumous Stanley Kubrick's film, his swan song ""Eyes Wide Shut.""

Its language can't be copied in a film.  If it were, nobody would understand the movie.  When I read Ulysses I had the Cliff Notes right by me, so I would have some idea what was going on.  If you have never read the book, you can't know what I'm talking about.  Browse it in a library and you will see.  Then try telling me what language it is written in, because I don't know.I liked the book very much even though I couldn't come anywhere near understanding it without the Cliff Notes.  As for the movie version, don't be afraid.  James Joyce did not write the screen play.  It was written in English and you'll do just fine.The story is about a Jewish man in Ireland named Leopold Bloom.  He's really a funny guy.  He is a sick puppy though.  He gets a sexual thrill out of the idea of his beloved wife Molly having sex with other men.  He himself hasn't had sex with her in over ten years, ever since their baby died in infancy.It's a heartbreaking story because Leo (Poldy, to his wife), and Molly are deeply in love with each other.  Meanwhile she is cheating on him with her employer Blazes Boylan, who has just made love to her seven times in one day.  You get angry at her for betraying our friend Leo Bloom until you realize that she is fully convinced that he is cheating on her, and has seen pretty convincing evidence of it.  Even with all her cheating, she is jealous regarding her man.  He's not, by the way.  He could be, easily enough, but he's not.Leo and Molly are unforgettable characters.  One of my strongest memories of them is from when they were first dating, and he bought her a little cake, and she chewed it all up into a wet ball, took it out of her mouth, and stuck it in his.  He swallowed it.  What a silly man he is.Then there is the time when he returned home to her at night, knowing that she just spent the entire day in his own bed having sex with Blazes Boylan, and, thinking she was asleep, he kissed her backside.  What a man!  What a silly man.One problem with the film is a problem shared with the book.  Some scenes just go on soooo long.

Generally the book is considered the most challenging English languague novels,but the movie was fun.It did have that strange Modernist lack of linearity that is notalways easy to grasp. And in some ways it reminded me of the visual presentaion of ""The Trial"" by Orson Welles, although much more upbeat.The Anti Semitism was so thick that you could cut it with a knife, but Bloom was an excellent character as was his wife Molly. And you could feel some people really loved the irascible character. Deadulus (the Joyce double) wasn't as fully developed, but was still effective.The ability to visualize stream of cosciousness writing isnearly impossible for an extended length of time, but it was a nice try.

553262,AFJFXN42RZ3G2,B00004W1A9,"R. DelParto ""Rose2""","[9, 9]","The film adaptation of James Joyce's Ulysses was quite appropriate at the time it was released, 1967, 45 years after the release of the book.  The novel was the most controversial and complex books of the 20th century, which involved issues of religion, sexuality, and self as it pertained to Joyce's own life. Joseph Strick attempts to interpret these core issues with the three main characters in the novel, Leopold Bloom (Milo O'Shea), Stephen Dedalus (Maurice Roeves), and Molly Bloom (Barbara Jefford).  Indeed, the film reflects the Sixties with its emphasis of ""free love,"" but not without the messiness that comes along with it.  The most interesting aspect of the film shows the intelligently done Molly Bloom segment that occupies, roughly, the last 45 minutes of the film.The cinematography is quite good.  Had the film been filmed in color than in black and white, the scenes may not have been effective in conveying parts of the book.  Strick does a fine job in capturing the Irish landscape with a postcard-like quality.  On a critical note, the film could have received an Ingmar Bergman treatment because the novel/film involves the intricacies of religion and the human condition.  However, if Joyce intended to present a humorous narrative, this film accomplishes his intentions.Overall, Ulysses offers segments of the novel that will help one understand and visualize its main premise.  It is not recommended to replace the reading of the actual novel, but rather to supplement it.
