It shows in every role he played - be it the many characters he portrayed in SCTV, in the many comical roles he played on the big screen, including the rare dramatic role in films as ""Only The Lonely"", or even as a series director in the last project he helped produce as well - the 1994 TV series ""Hostage For A Day"". John also displayed sheer brilliance in the many characters he portrayed as well, such as Harry Crumb, a bumbling private detective who tries very hard not to botch things up. His sheer determination saves the day as he attempts to solve a murder mystery, which produces many comical moments throughout the film. Harry solves his cases undercover, including being ""in cognito"" wearing numerous disguises. Who's Harry Crumb co-stars Annie Potts, Jeffrey Jones & Valri Bromfield.

15918,A26HFSVLAGULIM,0767821467,"Heather L. Parisi ""Robert and Heather Parisi""","[27, 27]","IN A NUTSHELL -- ""WHO IS HARRY CRUMB?"":John Candy plays bumbling Harry Crumb, the last survivor of a family of great detectives. This Crumb works in the agency his legendary grandfather founded, but he's been exiled to their ""Greater Tulsa"" office. Eliot Draisen (Jeffrey Jones) who somehow has become the Director of ""Crumb and Crumb"" assigns the inept Harry Crumb to find the kidnapped daughter of a multi-millionaire (played by the affable Barry Corbin from TV's ""Northern Exposure""). There is a catch, however ... Draisen doesn't want the kidnappers found, for reasons of his own. While Crumb bumbles along through various mishaps (aided by his able assistant, Shawnee Smith) which are articulated via a series of ridiculously funny comedy skits, the kidnappers feel completely secure. In the meantime, Elliot Draisen tries to have his way with the millionaire's wife (Annie Potts), but does that have anything to do with the plot?OKAY IT SOUNDS KIND OF PAT -- BUT:In ""Who's Harry Crumb?"", it's all in the execution. The series of vignettes that make up the heart of the film are John Candy at his best. He plays a series of ""under-cover"" impersonations that run the gamut from Middle Eastern Vice-President of operations to a blonde transvestite [in the epilogue]. The idea is that somehow, despite his penchant for being a complete idiot, he somehow catches the kidnappers, by accident. But -- not before breaking his boss's prize dinosaur eggs [literally] and everthing else that gets in his way. We can see what's happening, but it is the way that Crumb gets from point A to point B that makes this film entertaining and worth watching.ABOUT THE DVD:If being able to add English Subtitles and select scenes are features, then this DVD has features. It is, however, an excellent transfer in ""Widescreen Format"" and an obvious improvement over the VHS offering.POST SCRIPT:This is one of Candy's better efforts and he is largely a one-man band. His impersonations are all quite funny and truly ridiculous, especially the one where he plays Hungarian executive, DuJour Dioche. Here he goes from having excessive chest hair to having a beard in the wink of an eye. The skits alone make this a must-see for all and a must-have for any Candy fans.This film was released in February of 1989 and grossed $11 million. He managed to make another 18 films before he died of a heart attack in his sleep on location of the film ""Wagons East"", in Durango, Mexico on March 4, 1994. He was 43.",5,WHO'S HARRY CRUMB?

From the very beginning, Crumb's lack of tact, talent, and detective skills is obvious.  He photographs the wrong person on a stake-out, gets stuck in an air conditioning duct, has his tie eaten by a paper shredder, and constantly misuses the words on his word-a-day calendar.  While this may not be Candy's funniest performance, it does provide several stellar comic moments.The supporting cast of this movie is sensational.  Superb performances are turned in from Annie Potts, Barry Corbin, Shawnee Smith, and Wesley Mann as the lethargic butler.  The finest performance of the movie is accomplished by Jeffrey Jones, who plays the President of Crumb's detective agency.  The interractions he has with the befuddled Harry are outrageous and hilarious.If you are looking for the best of John Candy, I would suggest movies such as &quot;Planes, Trains, and Automobiles&quot; or &quot;Uncle Buck&quot; instead of this film.  &quot;Who's Harry Crumb?&quot; does have its share of over-the-top moments and comedy that borders on the edge of campy or cheesy.

The firm his illustrious ancestors started is still in existence, but Harry is 'out-stationed' in the backwater, and reduced to spying on cheating husbands (though he can still get a cheating wife or two, too).The head of the firm brings Harry in from the cold to work on a very important case; the kidnapping of one of the daughter's of a very wealthy client.  There's a reason Harry is brought in.  Is it Harry's surprisingly good impersonations?  Is it his surprisingly good accents?  Is it his doggedness?

But all of this is pretty much inconsequential with a person like John Candy as the star. People who have seen his other performances, know that he can turn the smallest role in to comedic masterpieces(such as &quot;Tom Tuttle from Tacoma Washington&quot; on Volunteers). And naturally, when he has a starring role, he can elevate a movie from mediocre to great, as evidenced by this particular movie. Without John Candy, I would rate this movie as one of the 5 worst ever, but since John Candy is in it, it's in the top 25(which is a pretty exclusive list!).All I can say is, if you still havn't watched this movie, even though it's been out for almost a dozen years, you're missing out on a hilarious movie.
