His character really doesn't fit into the action well or establish any chemistry with the other characters.

Byrd,"[0, 0]",I remember taping every episode of this show when it was on television and regularly looked for it when television series began appearing on dvds. As soon as I saw this for sale I snapped it up. I enjoyed watching it every week to see what kind of object was cursed and how the characters would manage to retrieve it.

1266401,A39C66NHY99BR1,B002FLOTYU,Gary M. Miller,"[21, 23]","I'm happy to announce that today, I received my copy of FRIDAY THE 13TH: THE SERIES - THE FINAL SEASON on DVD.  (The box states there are 19 episodes, but not to fear: ""The Prophecies,"" often seen as a 2-parter, originally aired as a 2-hour episode, and is included uncut in the set.)  I looked at the back cover for evidence of bonus features, and it said, and I quote: ""Special Features: Promos on Selected Episodes""!I've been pretty vocal about my dislike for the previous two season sets, with their near-total lack of extras and, most noticeably, the glaring omissions of the pre-titles sequence from every episode, and for the hardcore fans, the lack of the 30-second promos for the next week's episode.  Leave it to me, a fan of the show from 1988 (not quite the beginning) to notice and be bugged by these things.  So the ""Special Features"" note on this set was something I was too curious about.So far, I've only gone through disc 1, but it appears MY prayers, at least, were answered--to a degree. Not only does ""The Prophecies"" have the opening pre-title sequence (""Lewis Vendredi made a deal with the devil..."") intact, but also, all episodes on the disc have the original 30-second episode promos, very nearly as they appeared during the original airings, complete with the red band across the screen denoting an ""All-New Episode.""Why are they ""very nearly"" as they appeared? Well, do you remember at the very end of the promos, when they showed the tombstone with the F13 logo, the announcer said something like, ""Next week, drive like the devil!""? (Bonus points to the fan who can identify that particular episode!) Well, they edited out that part of the audio from the promo.  CBS/Paramount has them, master and all!  (If they didn't have the masters of the promos, then they would have been unable to separate any audio, as music and dialogue would be on the same ""tracks."")I'm afraid we don't have all the promos--six are missing from this season (""Mightier Than The Sword,"" ""Epitaph For a Lonely Soul,"" ""My Wife as a Dog,"" and ""Jack-in-the-Box,"" as well as those for the component halves of ""The Prophecies""), and definitely we won't see the promos from seasons 1 and 2 on these discs. I have to at least give CBS/Paramount kudos for restoring the promos in this set, and giving us the 30-second opener for the first time in the sets!What about the episodes themselves?  Well, Johnny (introduced in 2 episodes from season 2) is no Ryan (who departs after the first episode in this set), but aside from him, we do have an exciting season where the writers experimented with different types of curses.  If the show hadn't been shut down by parents' groups, we would have likely seen even more of a departure from the previous seasons like in this collection of episodes.Rating: 4 stars.  Not perfect, but this is the set I wish we'd received for seasons 1 and 2, and I'm very happy.",4,The FRIDAY set I've been waiting for since season 1's failure.,1253664000,"09 23, 2009",2009,2899,"[""'m"", 'happy', 'announce', 'today', 'received', 'copy', 'FRIDAY', 'THE', '13TH', 'SERIES', 'THE', 'FINAL', 'SEASON', 'DVD', 'box', 'states', 'are', '19', 'episodes', 'not', 'fear', 'Prophecies', 'often', 'seen', '2-parter', 'originally', 'aired', '2-hour', 'episode', 'included', 'uncut', 'set', 'looked', 'back', 'cover', 'evidence', 'bonus', 'features', 'said', 'quote', 'Special', 'Features', 'Promos', 'Selected', 'Episodes', ""'ve"", 'been', 'pretty', 'vocal', 'dislike', 'previous', 'two', 'season', 'sets', 'near-total', 'lack', 'extras', 'most', 'noticeably', 'glaring', 'omissions', 'pre-titles', 'sequence', 'episode', 'hardcore', 'fans', 'lack', '30-second', 'promos', 'next', 'week', 'episode', 'Leave', 'fan', 'show', '1988', 'not', 'quite', 'beginning', 'notice', 'be', 'bugged', 'things', 'Special', 'Features', 'note', 'set', 'was', 'something', 'was', 'too', 'curious', 'about.So', 'far', ""'ve"", 'only', 'gone', 'disc', '1', 'MY', 'prayers', 'least', 'were', 'answered', 'degree', 'Not', 'only', 'Prophecies', 'have', 'opening', 'pre-title', 'sequence', 'Lewis', 'Vendredi', 'made', 'deal', 'devil', 'intact', 'also', 'episodes', 'disc', 'have', 'original', '30-second', 'episode', 'promos', 'very', 'nearly', 'appeared', 'original', 'airings', 'complete', 'red', 'band', 'screen', 'denoting', 'All-New', 'Episode', 'Why', 'are', 'very', 'nearly', 'appeared', 'Well', 'do', 'remember', 'very', 'end', 'promos', 'when', 'showed', 'tombstone', 'F13', 'logo', 'announcer', 'said', 'something', 'Next', 'week', 'drive', 'devil', 'Bonus', 'points', 'fan', 'who', 'can', 'identify', 'particular', 'episode', 'Well', 'edited', 'out', 'part', 'audio', 'promo', 'CBS/Paramount', 'master', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'masters', 'promos', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'unable', 'separate', 'audio', 'music', 'dialogue', 'would', 'be', 'same', 'tracks', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'promos', 'six', 'are', 'missing', 'season', 'Mightier', 'Than', 'Sword', 'Epitaph', 'Lonely', 'Soul', 'Wife', 'Dog', 'Jack-in-the-Box', 'as', 'well', 'component', 'halves', 'Prophecies', 'definitely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'promos', 'seasons', '1', '2', 'discs', 'have', 'least', 'give', 'CBS/Paramount', 'kudos', 'restoring', 'promos', 'set', 'giving', '30-second', 'opener', 'first', 'time', 'sets', 'What', 'episodes', 'Well', 'Johnny', 'introduced', '2', 'episodes', 'season', '2', 'Ryan', 'who', 'first', 'episode', 'set', 'aside', 'do', 'have', 'exciting', 'season', 'where', 'writers', 'experimented', 'different', 'types', 'curses', 'show', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'shut', 'down', 'parents', 'groups', 'would', 'have', 'likely', 'seen', 'even', 'more', 'departure', 'previous', 'seasons', 'collection', 'episodes.Rating', '4', 'stars', 'Not', 'perfect', 'set', 'wish', ""'d"", 'received', 'seasons', '1', '2', ""'m"", 'very', 'happy']",N/A

1266405,A1DTNYGTWIN4DS,B002FLOTYU,NateMonroe,"[1, 1]","In the final season, things took a slight turn.Ryan was written out at the beginning of the season and Johnny became a regular.Even the tone of the show changed some. The stories became more serious in nature, and a little more violent. I remember in seasons one and two, some of the violence happened out of camera view, but not in season three. it's all right there. for example, in the story ""Crippled Inside"" a rack falls on a victim that has acid on it. We see the victim disolve. Had this been season one or two, we might have seen the rack falling on him, the camera cut away to an observer with the victims screams in the audio, then back to a puddle.Jack, in this season, became even more of the leader. in the first season, he was sort of clownish, but bt season three, he is pretty serious and always has a plan.A welcome change.Micki also changed. In previous seasons, it was fun to see her run in some of the outlandish clothes and hairstyles she had. Always beautiful and classy, it just seemed unlikely that a person in her position of going to all sorts of places to retrieve some items would ever even consider wearing some of the dress she wore. But by season 3, her outfits toned dow to more practicle things. Robey's acting is superb in season three, not that she did bad in the other seasons. It's just she seems more at home with her character and is more serious than before.Johnny is a welcome addition. He is not Ryan, whom I miss, but he is an asset to the show. He doesn't have the closeness Jack and Micki have, but if he had been given time, he would have made the perfect balance of the three. He is more serious then Ryan was.And as for Ryan, I do feel the show would have went on longer had the actor who played him, John D. Lamay, had stayed. His presence is missed because he was a big part of the wonderful show, but i am glad they wrote in someone like Johnny.To be honest, not all the stories worked. Each season had a couple duds, but a good 90% of them were fantastic and exciting.",4,The last---how sad,1300320000,"03 17, 2011",2011,2020,"['final', 'season', 'things', 'took', 'slight', 'turn.Ryan', 'was', 'written', 'out', 'beginning', 'season', 'Johnny', 'became', 'regular.Even', 'tone', 'show', 'changed', 'stories', 'became', 'more', 'serious', 'nature', 'little', 'more', 'violent', 'remember', 'seasons', 'one', 'two', 'violence', 'happened', 'camera', 'view', 'not', 'season', 'three', 'all', 'right', 'there', 'example', 'story', 'Crippled', 'Inside', 'rack', 'victim', 'acid', 'see', 'victim', 'disolve', 'Had', 'been', 'season', 'one', 'two', 'might', 'have', 'seen', 'rack', 'falling', 'camera', 'cut', 'away', 'observer', 'victims', 'screams', 'audio', 'then', 'back', 'puddle.Jack', 'season', 'became', 'even', 'more', 'leader', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'sort', 'clownish', 'bt', 'season', 'three', 'pretty', 'serious', 'always', 'plan.A', 'welcome', 'change.Micki', 'also', 'changed', 'previous', 'seasons', 'was', 'fun', 'see', 'run', 'outlandish', 'clothes', 'had', 'Always', 'beautiful', 'classy', 'just', 'seemed', 'unlikely', 'person', 'position', 'going', 'sorts', 'places', 'retrieve', 'items', 'would', 'ever', 'even', 'consider', 'wearing', 'dress', 'wore', 'season', '3', 'outfits', 'toned', 'dow', 'more', 'practicle', 'things', 'Robey', 'acting', 'superb', 'season', 'three', 'not', 'did', 'bad', 'other', 'seasons', 'just', 'more', 'home', 'character', 'more', 'serious', 'before.Johnny', 'welcome', 'addition', 'not', 'Ryan', 'whom', 'miss', 'asset', 'show', ""n't"", 'have', 'closeness', 'Jack', 'Micki', 'have', 'had', 'been', 'given', 'time', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'perfect', 'balance', 'three', 'more', 'serious', 'then', 'Ryan', 'was.And', 'Ryan', 'do', 'feel', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'went', 'longer', 'had', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'John', 'D.', 'Lamay', 'had', 'stayed', 'presence', 'missed', 'was', 'big', 'part', 'wonderful', 'show', 'i', 'am', 'glad', 'wrote', 'someone', 'Johnny.To', 'be', 'honest', 'not', 'stories', 'worked', 'season', 'had', 'couple', 'duds', 'good', '90', '%', 'were', 'fantastic', 'exciting']",N/A
