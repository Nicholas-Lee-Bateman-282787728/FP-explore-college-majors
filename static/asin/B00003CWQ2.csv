I had mixed feelings and feelings that the movie would get destroyed eventually, because it looked like there was a sect, and people shaved their heads, I felt like they were like nazi at some point. I was like: what the hell is this movie? God I hate nazis. And I was wrong. Thought this was the end, but it wasn't. A movie changed. The dude turned out to be crazy. In fact he is insane, but it also changes. The ending when he tries to pull a plug on everything he achieved, I thought was another imminent downfall for the movie. It did not happen.

Brad Pitt is outstanding-he plays a bit of a nut, as he did in 12 Monkeys. The person that makes the movie though is Edward Norton...with such movies as Rounders  and American History X..it isn't hard to see how that could be. The movie  had me from the beginning to the very end. It's hard to say much about it  without ruining the movie, so the best I can say is that it is a wild ride  that takes you through the life of a person at his breaking point..if you  liked Falling Down...this is 1,000 times better and had more twists than  6th Sense.

Imagine an underground chamber like a cave, with an entrance open to the daylight, and running a long way underground.  In that chamber are men who have been prisoners there -- since they were children, their legs and necks being so fastened that they can only look straight ahead of them and cannot turn their heads.  Behind them and above them a fire is burning, and between the fire and the prisoners runs a road, in front of which a curtain-wall has been built, like the screen at puppet shows between the operators and their audience, above which they show their puppets.&quot;  (Plato; trans. H.D.P. Lee)&quot;We are shown the ascent of the mind from illusion to pure philosophy, and the difficulties which accompany its progress.  And the philosopher, when he has achieved the supreme vision, is required to return to the cave and serve his fellows [by telling them about the Truth which he has seen...], his very unwillingness to do so being his chief qualification [for they do not want to listen... the knowledge of the Truth hurts their ears, disturbs their illusions...questions their living and their  lives...].  As [Francis M.] Cornford pointed out [in his edition of *The Republic*], the best way to understand the simile [of the cave]is to replace 'the clumsier apparatus' of the cave by the cinema [the movie theater!!].  It is the moral and intellectual condition of the average man from which Plato starts; and though clearly the ordinary man knows the difference between substance and shadow in the physical world, the simile suggests that his moral and intellectual opinions often bear as little relation to the truth as the average film does to real life.&quot;  -- H.D.P.

BUT... after seeing this movie about 6 times i wondered, what is the book like.  well after reading it i found that it is so much better than this film that i don't even like the movie much any more.  the book doesn't focus on excitement, fighting, cool camera tricks, or despicable corporate advertising!  it focused on the futility of our existence!  why we are here, how much we really know about ourselves, and so on!  the movie barely touched on these issues.  the movie was a thriller that surprised us at the end.  that was about all.  the movie really butchered many scenes, and excluded some really important plot details.  the book is also written in the most unconventional way i am aware of!well, my real point is that this is really a &quot;guy movie&quot; meaning that mostly guys will enjoy the violence, and the overpowering testosterone influences, but may not be interested in any deeper meaning.  the book has much testosterone as well, but it is more important to the plot.  i recommend reading the book after seeing the movie to see what i mean.  i could be completely wrong, but this is just my opinion.  2 3/4 stars",3,"good movie, but the book is so much better...",986169600,"04 2, 2001",2001,1736,"['ok', 'i', 'must', 'admit', 'good', 'movie', 'even', 'blatant', 'product', 'placement', 'big', 'hollywood', 'actors', 'well', '2', 'least', 'seemingly', 'unlimited', 'budget', 'was', 'great', 'film', 'when', 'i', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'i', 'was', 'amazed', 'jaw', 'wide', 'open', 'wondering', 'how', 'could', 'get', 'so', 'many', 'terrible', 'reviews', 'actors', 'are', 'excellent', 'amazing', 'direction', 'david', 'fincher', 'just', 'amazing', 'i', 'most', 'people', 'saw', 'fighting', 'violence', 'see', 'movie', 'underlying', 'meaning', 'lives', 'are', 'so', 'controlled', 'what', 'own', 'who', 'things', 'corporate', 'ties', 'wealth', 'so', 'BUT', 'seeing', 'movie', '6', 'times', 'i', 'wondered', 'what', 'book', 'well', 'reading', 'i', 'found', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'book', ""n't"", 'focus', 'excitement', 'fighting', 'cool', 'camera', 'tricks', 'despicable', 'corporate', 'advertising', 'focused', 'futility', 'existence', 'why', 'are', 'here', 'how', 'much', 'really', 'know', 'ourselves', 'so', 'movie', 'barely', 'touched', 'issues', 'movie', 'was', 'thriller', 'surprised', 'end', 'was', 'movie', 'really', 'butchered', 'many', 'scenes', 'excluded', 'really', 'important', 'plot', 'details', 'book', 'also', 'written', 'most', 'unconventional', 'way', 'i', 'am', 'aware', 'well', 'real', 'point', 'really', 'quot', 'movie', 'quot', 'meaning', 'mostly', 'guys', 'will', 'enjoy', 'violence', 'overpowering', 'testosterone', 'influences', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'interested', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'book', 'much', 'testosterone', 'as', 'well', 'more', 'important', 'plot', 'i', 'recommend', 'reading', 'book', 'seeing', 'movie', 'see', 'what', 'i', 'mean', 'i', 'could', 'be', 'completely', 'wrong', 'just', 'opinion', '2', '3/4', 'stars']",N/A

It's such a great movie and there is so much going on that I could write pages on it. But I'll do my best to keep it short. In my opinion this is one of the best movies, not just of our time, but of all times. The story is so full of political, social, and philosophical statements and themes, and there is so much going on in every scene that you can't just watch it once or twice or even three times. This movie demands to be watched over and over. To start with we have one of the best directors of his generation: David Fincher. I've no doubt that he'll one day take his place among the greats: Hitchcock and Kubrick. It has two of the best living actors, Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, who so fit their character that it is easy to forget that they are not Tyler Durden and Jack. And Helena Bonham-Carter is heartbreaking in this movie. The set design, wardrobe, and special effects are spectacular, but without overshadowing the story itself. This movie ranks with Citizen Kane, North By Northwest, and the Star Wars trilogy as the best movies of all times.Now for the dvd. First of all whoever designed the packaging did a brilliant job. It is a two disc set in a slipcover case designed in such a way that you can think of no better packaging for this movie. It even includes a small booklet ""How to Start a Fight"" which various members of the production staff chronicle the making of the movie. They even include quotes from reviewers, both good and bad. Disc One contains four commentaries. The first is David Fincher alone, and his commentary puts so much insight into the film you have to watch it again immediately after the commentary. The second commentary is Fincher, Ed Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena. And if you thought that Fincher put in as much insight as he could in the first commentary then you'd be wrong. The third commentary is the novelist, Chuck Palahniuk, and screenwriter Jim Uhls. They add another level of meaning to the movie. And it is especially nice to hear Palahniuk's take on the movie. The final commentary contains five important members of production. Director of Photographer Jeff Cronenweth, costume designer Michael Kaplan, production designer, Alex McDowell, and visual effects supervisor Kevin Haug, all of who add another level of understanding to the movie. There is even a little bit of Doc Baily who was the digital animator of the final scene. Disc Two contains all sorts of supplemental material such as outtakes, deleted scenes, 17 behind the scene vignettes, publicity, and more.All in all this is a smart movie that everyone should watch (and let's not forget, this movie is hilarious).

But where 'Dead Poets Society' is very naive and is plainly from the teen age point of view, 'Fight Club' is the adult version of the same theme, more cynical and disillusioned. 'Dead Poets Society' gives you some hope when it ends, even after Neal is dead, and you see Mr. Keating leaving the classroom after being fired, because his message would 'live on' with his remaining students. While in 'Fight Club', on the other hand the ending is seemingly happy - 'Jack' has gotten Tyler 'under control' (I'm trying not to spoil this for those of you who haven't seen the movie yet), but we all realize that all the damage that's already done has to be fixed, and that the 'Space Monkeys' are still around to do some more.I think the movie goes beyond showing us in what a 'rotten' society we live in. Even though Tyler tries to build a completely opposite kind of society, but instead of creating a 'perfect' society based on lessons learned from mistakes we've made, he gets a very similar society, that suffers from the same problems that ours does. Does the phrase 'group of nameless people dressed the same' describe Tyler's 'Space Monkeys' or what he sees as 'slaves with white collars'? Tyler can only give 'Jack' a view of his problems - not find a solution for them. Even when he tries, 'Jack' finds himself in the same place he started in. In one of the commentaries someone says that Marla is the equivalnet of 'Jack' only she has her life under control. Only when he makes peace with Marla, does he start to actually solve his problems, and not expect someone else to do it for him.",5,A movie that will change the way you think...,1023148800,"06 4, 2002",2002,2004,"['once', 'get', 'violence', 'film.Yes', 'movie', 'lot', 'violence', 'other', 'sorts', 'disgusting', 'stuff', 'bags', 'fat', 'lyposuction', 'clinic', 'etc', 'intentional', ""'d"", 'have', 'watch', 'movie', 'few', 'times', 'get', 'things', 'get', 'points', 'think', ""'Fight"", 'Club', 'somehow', 'similar', ""'Dead"", 'Poets', 'Society', 'message', 'how', 'wrong', 'conformity', 'where', ""'Dead"", 'Poets', 'Society', 'very', 'naive', 'plainly', 'teen', 'age', 'point', 'view', 'Club', 'adult', 'version', 'same', 'theme', 'more', 'cynical', 'disillusioned', ""'Dead"", 'Poets', 'Society', 'hope', 'when', 'even', 'Neal', 'dead', 'see', 'Mr.', 'Keating', 'leaving', 'classroom', 'being', 'fired', 'message', 'would', ""'live"", 'remaining', 'students', ""'Fight"", 'Club', 'other', 'hand', 'ending', 'seemingly', 'happy', ""'Jack"", 'gotten', 'Tyler', 'control', ""'m"", 'trying', 'not', 'spoil', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'yet', 'realize', 'damage', 'already', 'done', 'be', 'fixed', ""'Space"", 'Monkeys', 'are', 'still', 'do', 'more.I', 'think', 'movie', 'showing', 'what', ""'rotten"", 'society', 'live', 'Even', 'Tyler', 'build', 'completely', 'opposite', 'kind', 'society', 'instead', 'creating', ""'perfect"", 'society', 'based', 'lessons', 'learned', 'mistakes', ""'ve"", 'made', 'very', 'similar', 'society', 'suffers', 'same', 'problems', 'ours', 'Does', 'phrase', ""'group"", 'nameless', 'people', 'dressed', 'same', 'describe', 'Tyler', ""'Space"", 'Monkeys', 'what', ""'slaves"", 'white', 'collars', 'Tyler', 'can', 'only', 'give', ""'Jack"", 'view', 'problems', 'not', 'find', 'solution', 'Even', 'when', 'finds', 'same', 'place', 'started', 'one', 'commentaries', 'someone', 'Marla', 'equivalnet', ""'Jack"", 'only', 'life', 'control', 'Only', 'when', 'peace', 'Marla', 'start', 'actually', 'solve', 'problems', 'not', 'expect', 'someone', 'else', 'do']",N/A

He punches Himself repeatedly, and Proceeds to throw Himself into a Glass Shelf, and He's very, very bloody, By the End of it All.Blood can be Seen, On His Face and Shirt, but He gets Pay For the Rest Of the Year (50,000 grand or so), And is Emancipated from His Dead End job!!

Things that don't concern Project Mayhem and its members are: Poverty and Anarchy. Things that do concern Project Mayhem and its members are: some guy's name in the underwear, T.V. with 500 channels, Viagra, Rogaine, Olestra, and mass consuming, to hell with Martha Stewart. The Founder and President of Project Mayhem is: Tyler Durden (Durden means Death in some Nordic dialect). To fight between themselves and let it all out: pain, shame, deception, anger, fear, etc. Now it has move from the basements on to the surface, a full army packed with a lot of soap and a solid Idealistic view of human life. Actually, the more they size things up, the more they hate modern civilization and its superficial way of life. Mundane existence and the hunter essential gathering of sh..., they don't need, those are their essential enemies, also the life style of the rich and famous but, that's another story. Today's Society has become all about materialistic possessions, the more you have, the more you are as a person. Enough already with passive criticism, Action needs to take on, So far, So good.Fight Club is a unique story of every day odds against the uncomfortable human tolerance that has become all about consuming, we are consumers, and we at some point asks the inexorable question of our own existence that has become nothing more than a compulsive pushing for the perfect life in this none sense world of Sit-Coms and junk food, slowly learning the fact that we will never be Rock Stars or movie Gods, even though we have been raised to believed it (a quite hypocrite statement by movie God: Brad Pitt), in contrast, the more you are an stupid and superficial teen, the more you will fit into this society (Teens are the biggest social group of consumers, and maybe, the dumbest of all. Almost every market have target them), buy today's top music hits, buy today's latest designer's clothes, buy today's newest video game, buy sex, buy your happiness, this is your life, and is ending one second at a time.The audacious and keen artisan, David Fincher, narrates with a fine eye and straight style the anarchical story written by Chuck Palahniuk, of this underground fighting clubs, and how its individuals develops a revolution of idealistic breakthrough, towards self freedom. Eye opener, violent, and rough, Fight Club is an honest and fair critic towards this superficiality. Of course, Palahniuk takes it to the extremes, and Fincher portraits it with humor and deep understanding of its concept and message. Brad Pitt as the anthological Tyler Durden, brings credibility and force to this character, a very good performance, Edward Norton as The Narrator (also known as Cornelius, Travis, and other stupid names), conveys both fragility and moral strength to his excellent work, both actors and the director as a team are simply magnificent. Helena Bonham Carter and Meat Loaf are great two. But, what is the pathological profile of The Narrator and Tyler Durden, both as the same person? Well let me tell you: According to the DSM-IV (Diagnostic Criteria for the most common Mental Disorders), the two protagonist (as one individual), clearly shows the patterns of the Dissociative Identity Disorder (formerly Multiple Personality Disorder, 300.14). The various criteria for this disorder are: A. The presence of two or more distinct identities or personality states (each with its own relatively enduring pattern of perceiving, relating to, and thinking about the environment and self). B. At least two of these identities or personality states recurrently take control of the person's behavior. C. Inability to recall important personal information that is too extensive to be explained by ordinary forgetfulness. D. The disturbance is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., blackouts or chaotic behavior during Alcohol Intoxication) or a general medical condition (e.g., complex partial seizures). In children, the symptoms are not attributable to imaginary playmates or other fantasy play.Individuals with Dissociative Identity Disorder may manifest post traumatic symptoms (e.g., nightmares, flashbacks, and startle responses) or Post traumatic Stress Disorder. Self-mutilation and suicidal and aggressive behavior may occur. Some individuals may have a repetitive pattern of relationships involving physical and sexual abuse. Certain identities may experience conversion symptoms (e.g., pseudoseizures), or have unusual abilities to control pain or other physical symptoms. Individuals with this disorder may also have symptoms that meet criteria for Mood, Substance-Related, Sexual, Eating, or Sleep Disorders. Self-mutilative behavior, impulsivity, and sudden and intense changes in relationships may warrant a concurrent diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder. Dissociative Identity Disorder appears to have a fluctuating clinical course that tends to be chronic and recurrent. So, I hope this explains it to you, dear Amazon reader.An accurate and psychologically intone photography adds a lot to the film's content, also the excellent music by the Dust Brothers, brings more humor to the humoristic scenes and more power to the Fight and moral exposure scenes. Great script, but the problem of the film is that it's ambiguity doesn't lets the narration explain in a more clear way certain events of the story. Any way, this doesn't really hurts the movie.The two DVD versions are excellent and full of good extras, specially the Two Disc Special Edition. The visual and sound transferring is perfect, an ideal movie to watch on DVD.So, to resume Fight Club's message, and that is: just to give you the finger man, so watch out with the soap Punk.",4,Punk

518503,A1AUOVXPT5MYX4,B00003CWQ2,"A. Hutchinson ""Boogie Down Bronx""","[4, 4]","Arguably, nihilism in films is best personified by David Fincher, who in only three films (at that time) has already set his stamp on filmmaking. Of course, we didn't realize this until his second film which is the now classic ""Seven."" But in retrospect ""Seven"" was as bleak and despairing as anything done in mainstream cinema, and it was a Hollywood thriller no less. Then came ""The Game,"" a disappointment, but with the intriguing premise of a bottled-up and unemotional man who in the course of his nightmarish ""game"" learns to live again. ""Carpe Diem"" a la Kafka. This same premise is put into a societal point of view with ""Fight Club.""This is also Fincher's first literary adaptation. ""Fight Club"" comes to us via the novel written by Chuck Palahniuk. The film relates the story of a successful, yet depressed young man (Edward Norton) who has become an insomniac. He has a swanky apartment, catalog-ordered furniture, and a respectable position in a firm, yet he feels like he is missing out on life. He can't feel emotion anymore. On a whim, he visits a cancer-crisis group and bonds with Bob, played by Meatloaf, who now has breasts because of a rare cancer (insert laughter here). This bonding and emotional intimacy leads to catharsis and release, especially when he weeps between Bob's ample breasts. Not surprisingly, Norton sleeps well.Things are moving along great. Never mind that he's using these victims as emotional pumps, the point is he feels again. Then comes an uninvited femme fatale played with unabashed scuzziness by Helena Bonham-Carter...and she used to do Merchant-Ivory?Because of this fellow emotional sponge, Norton must look elsewhere. Enter Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt): Soap salesman and excrement chef who urinates in his customers' soups. These two bond by beating the crap out of each other. ""I want you to hit me as hard as you can, "" Durden says. Norton obliges by punching his ear. Soon though, a friendship is formed and Norton loses his pad thanks to a freak fire. Norton stays with Durden and the two continue to pummel each other. Naturally, other men gravitate. Finally, a club is established in which white-collar, civil, and cultured gentlemen become primal gladiators in a self-imposed ring. The object: Fight so one can feel masculine again.As with anything purely physical (and make no mistake that is exactly what it is) Durden decides to up the ante a tad and create a full-fledged urban terrorism group. Nihilism by way of Fascism. You see, ""Fight Club"" is about destroying the modern spineless society so that men can go back to what they truly are, hunters. Only problem is where does one draw the line? ""Fight Club"" is technically brilliant. Brave and stylistic, Fincher plays with our tale being told by Norton's narrator.

518506,A1VQY8XWM19IXB,B00003CWQ2,Alan Cerny,"[2, 2]","FIGHT CLUB is one of those rare films that cannot be fully judged until several years from its release.  I consider it the BLADE RUNNER of the 90s - BLADE RUNNER was hugely influential and changed film in many ways.  FIGHT CLUB is the same.  It is the ultimate guy film.  I was fortunate enough to see this in the theater and I wish this had done better at the box office, because it deserved it.  Ed Norton and Brad Pitt do career work here, as well as Helena Bonham-Carter.  David Fincher has crafted a masterpiece of timing and precision.  You literally do not know what will happen next.Is FIGHT CLUB violent?  Well, duh.  Of course it's violent.  For these characters violence is catharsis.  They are incapable of expressing themselves in other ways.  Does it celebrate violence?  No.  It just shows how it honestly is.  For men, violence IS a rush.  It IS a drug.  And like most drugs, it becomes addictive and unhealthy.  FIGHT CLUB is about men so frightened of change that they have to stoop to violence because they simply can't think of another way.  As the box set says, it is the first film of the new millennium.And how about that box set?  Funny how a film that makes fun of our need for &quot;stuff&quot; has the best packaging of any DVD this year.  But that's part of the movie too - don't need it, gotta have it.  But for the DVD fetishist, this one has everything - 4 commentaries, deleted scenes, documentaries, hidden stuff, previews and trailers (my favorite are the public service anouncements - those should have been released as trailers).  The picture and the sound quality are top-notch (hopefully Fox will release a DTS version in the future, but that's the only complaint).  The people who produced this DVD knew what they were doing, and now FIGHT CLUB is the watermark to measure all DVDs by.  Even the Criterion collection cannot compete (except maybe for BRAZIL).Love it or hate it, FIGHT CLUB is required viewing for anyone who considers themselves a film fan.

Do you really need to see the guys beaten into the bloody pulp to start the thinking process?What has prepared Mr. Fincher  for his &quot;penetrating&quot; look at the modern society? Making music  videos for Aerosmith, Madonna and - Oh my God! - Paula Abdul?  Shooting  commercials?I find it impossible to relate to any character, act or  emotion in that film. It seems that for the director and the movie's fans  only 2 alternatives exist - total boredom or extatic frenzy. You are either  a mindless consumer or a fierce destructor. Nothing in between?Ever  heard of contemplation, meditation, elation? Ever saw happy and content  people living their meaningful lifes? I do not mean the populace of Nora  Efron's idiotic paradise but real people living all around. Why is that  fascinationn with marginals?The film starts with the main character's  complaining. Let me translate it for you. - I am obsessed with that  condominium! - In human language it means - I love my home so much! --  I leaf through IKEA catalogue ad nauseam.- It means: - I like IKEA's style  - it's affordable, sensible and contemporary.-- All the contacts in  planes and tranes are brief, one-time.-  - So what? Some of these episodes  are little gems that would be spoiled by prolongation. What do you want? To  follow the guy you've spent a couple hours sitting next to to his home,  meet his family, stay for a week, see the photos, take his grandma to the  park?There are less infantile ways of seeing the world , dealing with  the problems and letting the steam off. Want to kick and punch - go to a  local dojo. It will take you years to learn the right moves.What is so  charismatic about Brad Pitt's pissing-in-a-soup character? Do you giggle  mischeviously seeing him insert a gigantic penis in a kiddie cartoon? That  is nothing else but the result of postponed adulthood of the pisser and the  gigglers.Do you fall for Helena Bonham Carter's heroine - the  psyched-out punk with a small Neanthertaloid face and Halloween hairstyle?  Want to share a room with her and listen to that - Hear me die...- creaking  on a daily basis?You can argue that watching a movie about Hitler you do  not necessarily enjoy what he is doing. But I've never seen Hitler played  by a stud icon. Fight Club guides you where the real excitement is. The  life outside is portrayed as a pitiful parody.What we see is a hellpless  dualism, the love/hate relationship with consumerism. They either wallow in  that or smash their head against that. No one is trying to use it  reasonably, to enjoy the benefits. No one is strong and wise enough to be  above - they either submit or attack.And the touch of conspiracy theory  is added, the much-loved urban paranoia. No one wants to be alone in a big  city, to accept the fact that the world around is mostly indifferent. So  the notion of a club - however weird - is very appealing. And I am sure the  film's fans consider themselves a club of a sort, the union of cool  guys.One of the funniest things is the club's franchising at it's  branding stage. When I see these chemical burn marks on the hands of the  initiated I imagine Tylor going through that eye-to-eye routine hundred  times: - Only when you are at the threshold...blah-blah-blah...you can not  stop the pain...blah-blah-blah...- then the guy drops and he is all  yours.The film has nothing to tell. All that contrieved pretentious  nonsense is laughable in it's efforts to &quot;tell the truth&quot;.  Millions of dollars were spent to glamorize the freaks doing their freaky  stuff and now the studio wants it's money back with the profit.Are you  willing to contribute your time and cash?

Imagine a film that showed beautiful people eating a fabulous, decadent meal, savoring every luscious mouthful - then, five minutes before the end, a spokesman for the American Heart Association came on screen with a warning that high fat foods cause heart attacks.  Or, imagine a film showing scantily clad women in provocative poses until, five minutes before the end, a representative from N.O.W. came on screen and warned that we live in a sexist society and, simply by watching this trash, viewers are validating her point.  Such is the awe-inspiring hypocrisy of Fight Club, a film that purports to be a cautionary tale about violence but is in fact a tutorial in it.The basic premise, that urban man has lost touch with his inner Neanderthal, is an interesting one, and would have served as the basis of a good movie.  To see how a better director approached the idea of innate violence, revisit Clockwork Orange, a masterpiece that director Fincher (Se7en - a much better movie) has certainly studied.  Kubrick's chilling adaptation of the Burgess novel came complete with skinheads, one of many similarities between the two works.  The second act of Fight Club is an orgy of brute violence with absolutely no redeeming qualities, and the third act offers one of the shabbiest, cheapest, and stupidest ""reveals"" - or ""aha"" moments - in the history of recent film.

It is also one of the most sophisticated movies to come out of Hollywood in years. In fact, I almost can't understand how the script made  it through the process. I mean it's anarchist, anti-materialistic, and  offers us Meat Loaf with testicular cancer. Oh, and by the way, it doesn't  really have a lot to do with fighting. That's just a, as they say,  vehicle.I can't wait to see it again. I was so blown away the first  time. I only saw it because I happened to be at a mall at the time, and  someone recommended it.I don't want to give anything away. I just want  to point out that is a venomous attack on &quot;the American way&quot;. In  fact, it puts American Beauty to shame.Norton's character is an  existential shell of a man, living in a Pottery Barn apartment, and  spending his free time checking out the self help circuit just to connect  with the outside world.That's until he meets Pitt. A club starts. Guys  fight. There's a machismo factor. That's what may have sold the script,  because after that the film enters the surreal and dangerous ideas surface,  ideas that, gosh, just ain't American.So see this film, then see it  again.

I was so wrong. Edward Norton plays the main protagonist, a cubicle worker for a large corporation, a man who's so devoid of life-force he can only find peace by attending self-help groups for the terminally ill. On a business trip he meets Tyler Durden, an easy-going salesman. They find that fighting - simply fighting, with no animosity or purpose - fulfills a need within themselves. Others join them, until they eventually have a club as fascist and mindless as the corporations they scorn. Along the way, the plot delves into some very dark and masochistic places, and the surrealistic story not so much draws us in, as forcibly abducts us, and we are played with, teased, and disturbed. The acting through-out is excellent. Brad Pitt completely becomes the charismatic Durden, who serves as our guide to this warped Underworld. Helena Bonham Carter is the morbid and trashy Marla Singer, a kind of groupie to the dying. Another excellent job was done by Meatloaf. There is a lot of pain here, but the pain and ugliness gives rise to black and sardonic humour, and by the end every last part of my soul, no matter how hard and critical, had been touched.The questions this story asks are disturbing. How much pain are we inflicting on ourselves in order to feel alive? Are our comfortable modern lives at odds with, and at risk of being destroyed by, our innate need for struggle? When we reject one set of values do we fall prey to another? Oddly enough, given the violent theme and the black humour, there is no meanness here, and the characters are not set up to be made fun of, (which I felt was the case in American Beauty), nor do they need our sympathy. There is no intent on the part of the characters to destroy life, but rather to destroy that which prevents us from experiencing life. I loved it, I loved being held hostage by it, and I am grateful to the artists who made it.",5,"Really, Really, Really Good.",971827200,"10 18, 2000",2000,2063,"['very', 'nearly', 'did', 'not', 'watch', 'one', 'bungee', 'jumped', 'head-first', 'conclusion', 'would', 'be', 'macho', 'guys', 'fighting', 'determine', 'who', 'was', 'most', 'macho', 'was', 'so', 'wrong', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'main', 'protagonist', 'cubicle', 'worker', 'large', 'corporation', 'man', 'who', 'so', 'devoid', 'life-force', 'can', 'only', 'find', 'peace', 'attending', 'self-help', 'groups', 'terminally', 'ill.', 'business', 'trip', 'Tyler', 'Durden', 'easy-going', 'salesman', 'find', 'fighting', 'simply', 'fighting', 'animosity', 'purpose', 'need', 'Others', 'join', 'eventually', 'have', 'club', 'fascist', 'mindless', 'corporations', 'scorn', 'way', 'plot', 'very', 'dark', 'masochistic', 'places', 'surrealistic', 'story', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'draws', 'forcibly', 'are', 'played', 'teased', 'disturbed', 'acting', 'through-out', 'excellent', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'completely', 'charismatic', 'Durden', 'who', 'guide', 'warped', 'Underworld', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'morbid', 'trashy', 'Marla', 'Singer', 'kind', 'groupie', 'dying', 'excellent', 'job', 'was', 'done', 'Meatloaf', 'lot', 'pain', 'here', 'pain', 'ugliness', 'rise', 'black', 'sardonic', 'humour', 'end', 'last', 'part', 'soul', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'critical', 'had', 'been', 'touched.The', 'questions', 'story', 'asks', 'are', 'disturbing', 'How', 'much', 'pain', 'are', 'inflicting', 'ourselves', 'order', 'feel', 'alive', 'Are', 'comfortable', 'modern', 'lives', 'odds', 'risk', 'being', 'destroyed', 'innate', 'need', 'struggle', 'When', 'reject', 'one', 'set', 'values', 'do', 'fall', 'prey', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'given', 'violent', 'theme', 'black', 'humour', 'meanness', 'here', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'set', 'up', 'be', 'made', 'fun', 'felt', 'was', 'case', 'American', 'Beauty', 'do', 'need', 'sympathy', 'intent', 'part', 'characters', 'destroy', 'life', 'rather', 'destroy', 'experiencing', 'life', 'loved', 'loved', 'being', 'held', 'hostage', 'am', 'grateful', 'artists', 'who', 'made']",N/A

The paradoxical lives of the lead character's alter-ego in contrast to his depressing modern-day desire for self-improvent and perfection shed light and warning on values of the American public. How consumerism and marketing has brainwashed us and how we have lost senses of ur true selves and the things that makes us individuals.  How we strive to live to the expectations of how we think others will percieve us.  And how the male psyche has been watered down by political correctness, feminization, and ironically our own self perceptions of manhood.  The movie is a satire on how we strive to control our lives against fate and how we depress ourselves trying to live up to something we are not.  And how we give up on being ourselves.

518519,A2PUYMR4W89GUY,B00003CWQ2,Amanda,"[2, 4]","Have I completely lost my mind? Call me crazy, but I consider ""Fight Club"" to be one of the greatest movies ever made. I'll start off by saying that I am a girl, and this is definitely a guy movie. But I don't care. The one and only complaint that I have about this film is that when its trailer appeared in theaters, it made it look like a beat-'em-up, macho guy-flick revolving around a bunch of men beating the crap out of each other. Well, it didn't sell it to me, and I completely dismissed it. LUCKILY, one of my female co-workers rented it when it came out on video and highly recommended it to me. It wasn't until another co-worker said it was something to check out that I did exactly that: I reluctantly paid the cash to rent it. I went home. I put the tape in my VCR. I fell deeply in love.This film had me from the very beginning. First of all, I had never really seen Edward Norton in any movie before, and if I had I just couldn't remember. I spent the first half of the film marvelling at his wonderful performance as a no-name character who suffers from insomnia and a support group addiction. Ever since this film, I have been a huge Edward Norton fan. And, even though I have never really liked Brad Pitt, I thought even he was perfect in this movie. He plays Tyler Durden, the wild and crazy man Edward Norton's character meets on a plane. They become best friends, and decide to start their own little ""support group"": Fight Club, where any man can join, and where every man takes a beating. Yes, the macho fighting is a major part of this movie, but there is a LOT more to it than that, but that is all I will say because I wouldn't want to spoil anything. I will just say that ""Fight Club"" warrants at least two viewings, if not more, in order to digest everything.When I finally got a DVD player 2 years ago, ""Fight Club"" was one of the first DVDs I bought. The double-disc set is all I could ever want and more: Great commentary by the director David Fincher, Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, and there is even commentary by Chuck Palahniuk who wrote the novel the movie is based upon (I also recommend that you read that - it's a great book). Plus there are a ton of deleted scenes, public-service announcements, behind-the-scenes featurettes...tons and tons of stuff to satisfy even the biggest ""Fight Club"" fan.People have asked me before what it is I see in this movie. I always tell them I love it because the acting is great, the mood of the film is great, it's funny, it's tragic, it's...a little confusing. It's just overall great. And for anyone who saw the trailer and was turned off, I remind you that looks can be very deceiving. I realize now that had I gone just by what I saw previewed at the theaters and not given it a chance, I would have missed out on seeing a really great film. And given the fact that there aren't too many great films out there nowadays, that would have been a real loss.",5,The First Rule Of Fight Club Is: Buy This DVD,1036195200,"11 2, 2002",2002,2930,"['Have', 'completely', 'lost', 'mind', 'Call', 'crazy', 'consider', 'Fight', 'Club', 'be', 'one', 'greatest', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', ""'ll"", 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'am', 'girl', 'definitely', 'guy', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'one', 'only', 'complaint', 'have', 'film', 'when', 'trailer', 'appeared', 'theaters', 'made', 'look', ""beat-'em-up"", 'macho', 'guy-flick', 'revolving', 'bunch', 'men', 'beating', 'crap', 'other', 'Well', 'did', ""n't"", 'sell', 'completely', 'dismissed', 'LUCKILY', 'one', 'female', 'co-workers', 'rented', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'video', 'highly', 'recommended', 'was', ""n't"", 'co-worker', 'said', 'was', 'something', 'check', 'out', 'did', 'exactly', 'reluctantly', 'paid', 'cash', 'rent', 'went', 'home', 'put', 'tape', 'VCR', 'fell', 'deeply', 'love.This', 'film', 'had', 'very', 'beginning', 'First', 'had', 'never', 'really', 'seen', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'movie', 'had', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'remember', 'spent', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'marvelling', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'no-name', 'character', 'who', 'insomnia', 'support', 'group', 'addiction', 'Ever', 'film', 'have', 'been', 'huge', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'fan', 'even', 'have', 'never', 'really', 'liked', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'thought', 'even', 'was', 'perfect', 'movie', 'Tyler', 'Durden', 'wild', 'crazy', 'man', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'character', 'meets', 'plane', 'become', 'best', 'friends', 'decide', 'start', 'own', 'little', 'support', 'group', 'Fight', 'Club', 'where', 'man', 'can', 'join', 'where', 'man', 'beating', 'Yes', 'macho', 'fighting', 'major', 'part', 'movie', 'LOT', 'more', 'will', 'say', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'anything', 'will', 'just', 'say', 'Fight', 'Club', 'warrants', 'least', 'two', 'viewings', 'not', 'more', 'order', 'digest', 'everything.When', 'finally', 'got', 'DVD', 'player', '2', 'years', 'ago', 'Fight', 'Club', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'DVDs', 'bought', 'double-disc', 'set', 'could', 'ever', 'want', 'more', 'Great', 'commentary', 'director', 'David', 'Fincher', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'even', 'commentary', 'Chuck', 'Palahniuk', 'who', 'wrote', 'novel', 'movie', 'based', 'also', 'recommend', 'read', 'great', 'book', 'are', 'ton', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'public-service', 'announcements', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurettes', 'tons', 'tons', 'stuff', 'satisfy', 'even', 'biggest', 'Fight', 'Club', 'fan.People', 'have', 'asked', 'what', 'see', 'movie', 'always', 'tell', 'love', 'acting', 'great', 'mood', 'film', 'great', 'funny', 'tragic', 'little', 'confusing', 'just', 'overall', 'great', 'anyone', 'who', 'saw', 'trailer', 'was', 'turned', 'off', 'remind', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'deceiving', 'realize', 'now', 'had', 'gone', 'just', 'what', 'saw', 'previewed', 'theaters', 'not', 'given', 'chance', 'would', 'have', 'missed', 'out', 'seeing', 'really', 'great', 'film', 'given', 'fact', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'many', 'great', 'films', 'there', 'nowadays', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'real', 'loss']",N/A

A time when the economy allowed for investors to front money for the production of more risky pictures as opposed to sticking with the conservative 'plastic coated'...'popcorn' garbage that has been produced in the past few years.For a movie that attacks a value system that is partially reasponsible for its production is the sweet irony that made me reflect upon myself when the timing was absolutely perfect.Fight Club is a perfect addition to your Blu-ray collection.

And that can be either good or bad, depending in your sensibilities.  Many critics seem to have been thoroughly divided by this film.But everywhere I go, I seem to hear nothing but good things about it from friends and strangers alike.  I have to agree with them; I think this movie has more good things than bad.  It is a mesmerizing story with lots of memorable moments (both funny and dramatic), and it is well-developed.  It has some interesting thought-provoking content, including some comments and themes about consumerism and capitalism.  With a seemingly nonsensical twist toward the end, the plot makes sense in its own way (and seems really sublime on repeated viewings).  Characters are strong; the narrative is very interesting and there are a lot of memorable lines.  Acting and writing are excellent.  There are some interesting special effects, most of which hold up to this day.  Photography is solid, and the editing style is interesting.  It all works together to create some distinctive imagery.  Production design (sets, props, costumes, sets) is excellent.  Music is really interesting (performed by the Dust Brothers).This disc has awesome quality.  The picture is very sharp and detailed, with excellent color and contrast.  There is a fine layer of film grain; it is noticeable and noisy in some scenes, but detracts very little from the image overall.  Sound quality is excellent (DTS-HD MA 5.1), with a few of the more exciting scenes being really loud and the rest of the movie being clear and solid.  This disc includes lots of extras, including a few commentaries, some featurettes and deleted scenes ported over from the old DVD release, and a couple of new features (some awards footage and something that lets you fiddle around with the sound mixing on select scenes).  My copy came with a cool slipcover that can fold open.There is also a nice little gag with the menu screen.  If you put the disc in your player and you see a menu screen appearing for a romantic comedy called ""Never Been Kissed,"" don't panic.  The screen will flicker, and the real menu will appear.

It's a shame, because I feel that if I had been expecting a little less, I would have liked this movie more.  I'm not saying that Fight Club is a bad movie, all I'm saying is that I don't get it the way some people do (although there are many people who don't get some of my favorite movies the way I do, such as Lost In Translation and Garden State).Edward Norton plays the unnamed Narrator, an insomniac who is obsessed with material goods, namely furniture.  When his condo, and by default, all of his furniture, is destroyed in an explosion, he moves in with Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a strange but intriguing man that he met on an airplane.  Tyler's home could not be more different from the Narrator's; the house was dilapidated, it had almost no furniture, save a few beds and tables, and was beyond an eyesore.  But it doesn't matter because the two men become good friends.  Eventually, they start Fight Club, which is kind of like a support group for men who want to just let loose and blow off some steam.  At first, the two are really into it, and it is a small, exclusive little thing.  But soon it grows until there are clubs all over the country, and membership reaches numbers greater than 1,000.  That's when things start to get weird for the narrator.  People start acting very different around him, and they seem to blindly follow Tyler in whatever he does.Also, there is this girl named Marla (Helena Bonam-Carter, who does not look to good in this film) who is somewhat of a mystery to the Narrator.  She always seems to be over to make love with Tyler, but when they're done, she tries to talk to the Narrator.  He is confused by the situation, and it causes her to get really angry and storm out.I don't know; some of the people I know have said that this is one of those movies that you have to view more than once in order to fully understand, but as much as I enjoyed it, I feel that once is enough for a while.  I would suggest checking it out- as long as you can handle a lot of violence (the movie is called Fight Club, so what do you expect?), and some nudity.",4,An Interesting Film; A Bizarre Look At Life,1107043200,"01 30, 2005",2005,2260,"['while', 'people', 'have', 'kept', 'telling', 'see', 'movie', 'saying', 'amazing', 'will', 'change', 'life', 'went', 'really', 'high', 'expectations', 'shame', 'feel', 'had', 'been', 'expecting', 'little', 'less', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'movie', 'more', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'Fight', 'Club', 'bad', 'movie', ""'m"", 'saying', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'way', 'people', 'do', 'are', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'favorite', 'movies', 'way', 'do', 'such', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'Garden', 'State', '.Edward', 'Norton', 'unnamed', 'Narrator', 'insomniac', 'who', 'obsessed', 'material', 'goods', 'namely', 'furniture', 'When', 'condo', 'default', 'furniture', 'destroyed', 'explosion', 'Tyler', 'Durden', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'strange', 'intriguing', 'man', 'met', 'airplane', 'Tyler', 'home', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'more', 'different', 'Narrator', 'house', 'was', 'dilapidated', 'had', 'almost', 'furniture', 'save', 'few', 'beds', 'tables', 'was', 'eyesore', ""n't"", 'matter', 'two', 'men', 'become', 'good', 'friends', 'Eventually', 'start', 'Fight', 'Club', 'kind', 'support', 'group', 'men', 'who', 'want', 'just', 'let', 'loose', 'blow', 'off', 'steam', 'first', 'two', 'are', 'really', 'small', 'exclusive', 'little', 'thing', 'soon', 'are', 'clubs', 'country', 'membership', 'numbers', 'greater', '1,000', 'when', 'things', 'start', 'get', 'weird', 'narrator', 'People', 'start', 'acting', 'very', 'different', 'seem', 'blindly', 'follow', 'Tyler', 'girl', 'named', 'Marla', 'Helena', 'Bonam-Carter', 'who', 'not', 'look', 'good', 'film', 'who', 'somewhat', 'mystery', 'Narrator', 'always', 'be', 'make', 'love', 'Tyler', 'when', ""'re"", 'done', 'talk', 'Narrator', 'confused', 'situation', 'get', 'really', 'angry', 'storm', 'out.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'people', 'know', 'have', 'said', 'one', 'movies', 'have', 'view', 'more', 'once', 'order', 'fully', 'understand', 'as', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'feel', 'once', 'enough', 'while', 'would', 'suggest', 'checking', 'out-', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'handle', 'lot', 'violence', 'movie', 'called', 'Fight', 'Club', 'what', 'do', 'expect', 'nudity']",N/A

There were the fight scenes where you can witness lots of bleeding and punching. It has its humor, it has it's dark appealingness to it...it sounds good, but I guess I just wasn't interested.

Cool, noir atmosphere, beautfiul dialogue, great acting, beautiful action, interesting theme...Then in the later half, the movie falls apart. First of all, unlike the book, the movie was visual and therefore unable to hide it's major twist for a long time. When I read the book, it was like 'Oh my God! So that was it! So that was what was happening!' Since I already read the book before I saw the movie, I knew what was happening all along so I have no say. But my brother and his friends, all of whom watched the movie first, caught on in first twenty minutes and things became kind of stale after that.Then there's the sheer impossibility of it all. Yes, it's a dark fantasy not meant to be realistic in the fist place. Yet the book managed to stay true to life and believable because of the blase manner in which it is presented and the foggy atmosphere of the book. The movie tries too hard for too much and in effect makes itself look ridiculous. The director tries to make everything too cool, so that there's nothing but coolness. The bare suppressed seething rage of the book is nowhere to be seen. Brad Pitt struts his muscles and cool yellow sunglasses, Norton becomes a super-anti-hero, so what.I believe that the movie would have been a lot better if it had kept true to the book's version of the story. This is bad screen adaptation at its worst. The ending was a standard Hollywood &quot;Everything's gone and done now, let's be happy and party!&quot; kind of happy ending. God, PLEASE. This simply isn't that kind of movie! It's meant to be about rage, about loss, about self-contempt, and about all that it promised in the beginning.

Ten years ago? Watching a TV rerun of it just a few hours ago, I felt nothing special. I suppose I have other interests now.But sure, it's not a *bad* movie. If you like bizarre, unusual stories with unexpected plot twists, you're gonna love ""Fight Club"". It's not a co-incidence that this twisted story is considered a cult movie!The main character (who is unnamed) is a bored, lonely white-collar employee with some pretty weird pastimes who meets a mysterious stranger on the airplane. The stranger, Tyler Durden, convinces him to join a fight club which turns out to be a cover for an advanced terrorist operation against modern civilization. The plan is to recreate a more natural, primitive society with economic equilibrium by blowing up all major credit institutions. Sounds eerily familiar, somehow. The Unabomber? Deep Green Resistance? However, the political message is really a footnote to the rest of the story, with its various subplots, each more insane than the other. ""I know you are a tourist"".Apparently, ""Fight Club"" is based on a novel and is supposed to have some really deep message about the alienation of the late 20th century White male. Or something to that effect. Others see it as a protest against consumerism. I admit that neither I nor my buddies got it. To us, it's simply an absurd cult classic, featuring Brad Pitt - neither more nor less. It's a movie you might like if you enjoyed ""True Romance"", ""Pulp Fiction"" or (perhaps - but that's a very big perhaps) ""The Matrix"".

And is it worth a purchase if you have the dvd?  A resounding yes to both.When blu-ray is used to its fullest potential any film takes on a new life.  That is what happens here.  Everything that was intense intensifies - darks take new form, colors are vibrant.  There are many unique scenes and backdrops in this film.  On blu-ray  you see even more clearly what the director wanted to portray.  The 1080p/AVC-encoded transfer is a huge improvement from the dvd especially when it comes to overall clarity and color depth.  The audio is impeccable.  At times you can hear a pin drop and the expected explosions are so realistic you will be dumbfounded.  And all inbetween brings the film to a bigger reality.Fans rejoice.  Finally FIGHT CLUB can be seen in all its glory.  The impressive cast led by Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter is astounding and the lead three give performances so creative, so unique and so intense that they rival the best in their careers.

Love""","[16, 57]","The previous reviewers are all good people who obviously love cinema.That said, this movie is really pretty terrible.  I most sympathize with the reviewer who said that it wasted two hours of her life.Honestly, folks, what is it about?  The acting and cinematography are excellent.  The dialogue is that ""quirky and edgy"" garbage that passes for ""Literary"" writing these days.  (Read Hemingway to learn how people actually talk.)But the plot is mindless.  It's all about showing off how progressively weirder you can pile things up as a writer, but it is just plain nonsense.  It reeks of Iowa School plotting.  Or Irvine.  Which is the only part of California technically located in Iowa.Rent ""The Station Agent"" and see what a really good script can do for a really low budget movie.The stuff in here, man...I about threw up.  I kept waiting for a payoff, but it was just a lot of sadistic violence and an ""apocalypse"" payoff that comes from what, what?  The doppelganger stuff doesn't work.  There is no motivation.  Boredom does not count.  The notion that somehow bringing down New York ""frees"" debt slaves is stupid.  Computers in Podunk have the information.All in all, unless you are a very angry person stuck in a terrible and pathetic adolescence, this is not a decent movie.  Too bad.

Anyways, this movie is a complete 180 of what i thought it would be.  The previews made it look simple, two guys hate life, so they start a fight club. in reality, this is one mind numbingly great movie.  By the end of the first watch of this movie, i just didnt know what to think at all.  It was just so....yeah. But after letting it sink into my mind and giving it a second viewing, it was just amazing.  My friends and I dont even refer to Brad Pitt as himself anymore, we call him Tyler Durden because this was obviously one of his best performances.  As Durden, Pitt is damn near addicting, you begin to see why so many people would follow him.  That ""who cares i do what i want"" personality is portrayed perfectly on Pitt's part, and Norton, what an underrated actor. This man is a chameleon on the screen, so much so that in the same year he played the neurotic, scrawny wreck in Fight Club, he played the ripped, hate-filled, relentless racist in American History X.  He's one of the best character actors around.  This movie is hard to follow on first watch mainly because its all so out there, it took me til the second watch to realize that Norton is unnamed throughout the entire movie.  If you don't watch it twice, it probably wont be as good. And dont, for the love of god, watch it on TV. FX played it one night and it was just not the same thrill.  Alot of people complain about the violence in this movie, saying its poorly done. Well, thats the idea, these men arent ninjas or professional fighters, they're just normal men, so the fights are filmed just right.  Word to the wise, if you're squemish during brutal fight scenes, turn away when Norton fights Jared Leto (blond guy) its pretty intense. All in all, this movie is a classic cult flick.

Only few films managed to be so many things at  once. David Fincher, in my opinion one of the most exciting directors of  the decade, fills his movie with so many ideas that it would be sufficient  for three more movies, and they are not just gimmicks for their own sake,  they all mean something. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are brilliant in the  leads and the soundtrack by the Dust Brothers fits perfectly to the  images.Many reviewers thought the film was fascist. I think you can only  call this ridiculous, since that assumes Fincher sympathizes with Tyler  Durden's project mayhem. In fact, he invites us to form our own opinion,  like Stanley Kubrick did in &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;. &quot;Fight  Club&quot; hands over the resposibility  to the viewer.

So he meets Tyler Durden pplayed by Brad Pitt.  This film mainly works as a black comedy and as a social comentary. Those  two start a club which they fight.

518561,A3VZVYWCTGIEV0,B00003CWQ2,"Bill Your 'Free Form FM Print DJ ""bill nicholas""","[5, 6]","WARNING. THIS REVIEW GIVES END OF FILM AWAY.Critics and viewers who think this is about getting your macho up miss the point. So do those who think this is a ""violent"" film. Fight Club is really about personal liberation, and genius that osolates into insanity.Ed Norton's no name character is living a banal, materialistic yuppie life. He has no friends, no gal, and his possessions define him. Low and behold, he can't sleep.Our hero first seeks refuge in support groups and new age mush. He goes to meetings for diseases and addicitions he does not have. He is a ""tourist,"" and at first, a very sound sleeping one.Until he meets Marla, fellow tourist. Marla is much better at this game than he is. She is also alot more crazy, or liberated, or both. She walks in traffic, realizing life can end any moment. She outwits her rival tourist, and soon, he is back to sleepless square one.Soon, he meets Tyler. Tyler has no use for material objects, but has as much distain for the touchy feely, microwave sensativity alter-exisistance of our protagonist. Tyler beleives in living in the moment, which requires shedding of all attachments, physical and mental. ""It is only when you have lost everything,"" he says, ""that you are free to do anything""How does one get here? The two start an underground, secret fight club, where other young men with similar plights can go and box, with total abandon. Eventually, this grows,  to the edge of sanity. Soon, boxing is found to be only a means to an end--stripping ones self down to primal instincts and being truely alive. Between bouts, Tyler starts a fling with Marla.But even fighting and worrier simplicity is not enough; the fight club decides to spread the gospel, and devise a plan to blow up several financial institutions, wiping out credit records and thus the whole base of materialistic capitalism, which, fight club members would say, binds us all into emotional sleep  in pursuit of $300 neckties and Dolche Gabana armpit razors.Fair enough, but anarchy  was not what our narrator intended--all the guy was really trying to do was get some sleep--and he sets out to stop Tyler from executing his  master plan.Only one problem: Tyler does not exist.This raises one of several major points in the film. Our hero did not feel he could make such big changes on his own, and sets up an alter-ego, which is really his ideal self--all the things he aspires to be and can't. This sounds insane, but to a degree,  we all have a fantasy about doing what we want when we want, saying what crosses our mind, and being free from the demons-material, social, and psycological- that stop us from being ourselves. Usually, we see our ideal selves as another person, devorced from us.Now, if we believe our heros version of events, he has gone quite mad, but on another level his madness is genius. We all have this internal process. He just externalized it, and probably came closer to getting free form his chains then most of us will. Where does personal liberation end and anarchy begin? Good question, and isn't it the fear of stepping over the line that  stop most of us from finding out. Which is scarrier--staying how we are or wading into the forbidden zone? I don't know.Fight Club  makes more keen social comments. When our hereo begins to let go of his yuppie lifestyle and begins his 12-step programs, he is only trading one costume for another. The film is as critical of the 'lets cry and find our power animal' psudo-psychology that has infested out culture as it is the crass materialism it replaces. It is like the alcoholic who goes to AA, and this replaces the liqour as the base for his or her identity.The violence in Fight Club is really not violence as we think of it. Everyone fighting wants to be there, and the intent of the fighting is collective liberation, not to do harm to another. It is a means to an end: with other characters, the boxing could have been pottery or fly fishing. So it is difficult to be upset by this ""violence"" when you consider its unique roll in the story.Two other points about violence stand out: First, the one time he takes  a fight to far and disfigures a fellow member, it is at a point in the film where he is about to go over the edge; a turning point.Second, yes, empty skyscrapers are blown up at the end of Fight Club. But remember, this was two years before September 11th. We knew in the back of our minds a large scale terrorist attack was possible, but our biggest focus in 1999 was how much the NASDAQ went up each day; this was a very different time. America was partying. No one knew the unthinkable would happen soon, so you really can't say, retroactively, that the destruction in the film was in bad taste.Regardless, Fight Club is a funny, entertaining, thought provoking film, its points much more nuanced than the title and fight scenes indicate.",5,classic,1246924800,"07 7, 2009",2009,4863,"['WARNING', 'THIS', 'REVIEW', 'GIVES', 'END', 'OF', 'FILM',

518568,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B00003CWQ2,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[1, 1]","I have to admit from the beginning that I had never seen FIGHT CLUB before 2010. Yes (hangs head in shame), I'd heard all the hype and thought it to be just that: hype. Although I did notice that most of the kudos came from guys, not gals, even though the well-built Brad Pitt (Inglourious Basterds) was liberally smeared on cover displays along with witty (and not unhandsome) Edward Norton (The Painted Veil). Hmm. So I finally took the plunge and picked up a Blu-Ray copy.Although brutal along the lines ofGoodFellas, Fight Club is smart, funny, and exceptionally dark. It also has at its heart a (very) surprisingly good love story starring Helena Bonham Carter (Sweeney Todd). I also think this is one of Carter's strongest roles. She is so beyond anything I'd ever seen from her that I originally had trouble believing it WAS her in the film.If you can get past some of the more gory scenes, I dare say that all viewers will be well-rewarded in the end. That's not to say you should dismiss the violence. Indeed, it is part-and-parcel to the entire components of the film and its incredibly awesome story structure.And this isn't the first time Brad Pitt and director David Fincher have worked together. In 1995 they did the excellent filmSeven. If you enjoyed that film, you'll absolutely fall in love with this one. Fincher loves to play mind-twists but he doesn't do it in a heavy-handed way or even in a directly misguiding one (unlike M. Night Shyamalan with his groundbreakingThe Sixth Sense).Although the twist towards the end was enjoyable, I was an astute enough viewer to realize what was going on long before its reveal. Which didn't make the movie any less enjoyable. It was HOW the reveal was pulled off that made the film so amazing.Some of those who haven't seen the film might want a kind of blow-by-blow description ...and many reviews like that can easily be found.

There is no need for me to go into detail here as I see many have more than adequatly described the plot and many of it's nuances.  More so, becuase many of the points raised don't lend themselves to discussion in the space provided ( in which on could hardly do justice to one of it's themes. )On the otherhand, I will point out that, as many have stated, people love or hate this film.  ( some probably do both ).  I will not decend to the egotism of those who say if you don't like it you aren't bright enough to understand it ( not that I am not that egotistical) but I did notice that most of the negative comments seem to reject the films world view.Tyler clearly has a world view that many, particularly young ( perhaps predominently white ) men feel these days.  Lack of purpose, no worthwhile goals ( other than a cool new car or nice furniture ), a society that trys to create our opinions for us.  I unstand why this would bother some views.  They may not understand it, they may think that such people, the favored childeren of society, are just being foolish, or perhaps they are afraid of a world were people reject the comfortable values that make their little sterile and safe society possible.  ( More pessimistiacally, perhaps they fear the effects on accepting such values themselves.)In anycase, the fact that one does not agree with the message of a film does not make it a bad film.  ( You may as well condemn The Ten Commandments for being about religion ) The acting is outstanding, the direction is marvolouse, the vast majority of the dialog is sharp and in many cases very insightful, and ( for those who thought it was advocating all those things that scared them so much ) it spends it's last act with the &quot;hero&quot; trying to stop what is going on and recognizing the inhumanity of what &quot;his&quot; followers have become.Agree or not.  Empahize or not.  But if you open your mind you may gain some insight into how some people see the trap that their lives have become.

518572,AYC3Y4QX7GATV,B00003CWQ2,"Bob Dog ""My Thoughts""","[10, 15]","Frightening - Not the movie, necessarily, which was definitely thought provoking, but what I read in the other reviews about how many people want to embrace a message it may contain as the key to salvation and freedom in our modern, Bourgeois society.Its frightening to me how quickly the depressed, downtrodden, and lonely adopt violence toward, and destruction of other people as the solution to their ills.  Reminds me of Nazis, or the KKK, al Qaeda, or any other organization seeking to hurt other people to make themselves feel better. Perhaps a few hundred of the prior reviewers might ask me to justify my position:1. I judge everyone I meet with a simple test - who's needs are about to be met - mine or yours?  While Brad, Ed, and the boys were tearing each other up I think the message was just peachy.  Whatever floats your boat. But when they started terrorizing, maiming, and killing other people it became clear that they were meeting their own needs at the expense of everyone else.  Way uncool.  No, you say, way cool.  Have you ever been a victum of violence?  Apparently not. I'd ask you to withhold judgement until it happens to you.2.  Tyler says; ""We are by-products of a life style obsession. Murder, crime, poverty, these things don't concern me. What concerns me are celebrity magazines, television with 500 channels, some guy's name on my underwear."" To combat their terrible insensitivity to what is important, the boys immediately snap into action, and suddenly become very much interested in murder and crime, - causing more of it.3.  I judge every society on how it treats those who are less powerful.  I would have found the message more credible had it been wrapped in anything other than an all-star team of various ways to abuse power.  While the Ed character occasionally cops a conscience (the scene when Brad terrorizes the store clerk), he is also particularly vile, invading the privacy of the support groups, mentally abusing the girl, nearly killing and permenantly maiming the other fighter near the end of the movie Why? ""He was beautiful,"" and in general, preying on the weak and easily influenced.I give ""Fight Club"" five stars for provoking thought (see terrorism comments below).  But it was hard to overlook (one point taken away) and not be repulsed by the cheap, commercial display of nearly every conceivable way one person can diminish, dehumanize, and destroy another person as a surprisingly effective means of selling theater tickets.What I took away from this movie was not how terrible our society is, but how great it can be - if we can find a way to confine Brad, Ed and the boys to their own basements.  Better yet, finding a way of removing any reason for them to go down to the the basement in the first place.If there was ever a movie that had something compelling so say about our society and where its going....its what this movie has to say about terrorism.  Did you see the buildings get blown up, one after another in the last scene?  Perhaps I was the only one who saw the twin towers.  Are we to react with more violence, or something more fundamentally and compassionately human...Final thought (among many): Imagine for a moment if all this ""fight-clubbing"" is exactly what we're seeing in the large recruitment of middle eastern terrorists.  Tyler's message about the ugly banality of modern bourgeois society now seems cheap and banal itself.  Perhaps something much more real and important - the starvation, poverty, abuse and neglect of vast numbers of people in middle eastern societies is a much greater, much more real threat, not something as superficial as ""...500 channels of television...""",4,Very Frightening...not the Movie.

I was blown away by the amount of action and humor contained in this single film.

The humor is intermittent with the narrators ramblings one moment then fight club induced crimes the next that left me on the floor laughing uncontrollably. The cast is fantastic especially Edward Norton as he falls continuously into the confusion and deceit of daily life.I bought this DVD a few months back in order to relive the moments that I enjoyed when first watching it all those years ago.

518582,A2AA00U9FO4UAC,B00003CWQ2,Bradley J. Keusch,"[0, 0]","the reviewer wfparish (sorry if i spelled that incorrectly) hit the nail right on thehead, quite possibly the greatest aspect of this movie is that it WILL make you think, make you question how you live, and quetion the benefits of society, especially the one in which we live. That, i think, is one of the reasons why so many people don't like this movie. Many people don't like to have their beliefs challenged, which this movie wil do. Also, so many people are shocked by the violence in here, but throughout the enitre movie *one* person dies. These same people sat through the opening scene in Saving Private Ryan where dozens to hundreds of people were brutally killed without complaining. The violence just comes in a different context, which is entirely justified in terms of the movie.The men who go to fight club, go for a reason. They go, knowing that they WILL get beaten up. But they also go, and this is the motivating factor, to FEEL. They live their lives feeling nothing, just doing the same *meaningless* stuff day after day. They ae searching for something, for happiness ultimately, and the path society tells them to take to be happy isn't working. Fight club provides them with raw emotion, and they take this to be happiness. As Fight Club spirals out of control and into Project Mayhem, we see the consequences of the path the protagonst took to escape the *evils* of society. Is the path he took the only possible path? no. And that's another complaint many have. Norton's character didn't have to do what he did, go through everything he went through, and thus could have saved many people a lot of pain. But my answer is that he DID have to do what he did. He even said himself that he did not know how to change the live he was leading, he only knew that he was sick of it, as so many people are (which is why so many people joined him in his cause). What he did wasn't ncessairily RIGHT, but the question you should ask yourself is this. Is what he did, and what he became ultimately, better than the life he would have led if he would've remained in his little cubicle? The answr may surprse you. i think the main idea this movie tries to instill in you is that you should not blindly follow.The movie attacks corporate America, sayng that people are *wasting* their lives away in cublicles. It attacks the media, and their attempts (quite often successful) to make us conform. After looking at a Calvin Klein ad of a muscular man in underwear, Pitt as Tyler Durden says, ""Self improvement is masturbation. Self destruction, might be the answer."" whether or not you see this as true,is up to you and you alone. I'm not even going to state my opinion, because it doesnt matter. what matters is that you see this movie, which is unbelivable. And don't let this review make you think that you'll be bored out of you mind. i just tried to delve deeper into what the movie is trying to say. It is extremely entertaining, David Fincher has yet again done a tremendous job, and David Uhls brought the book to the screen splendidly, retaining much of the comedy that lightens an otherwise rather dark movie. Ed Norton, and Brad Pitt both give amazing performances, as does Helena Bonham Carter. The DVD itself comes packed extremely well, complete with a pamphlet entitled ""how to start a fight"" that has many of hollywood's opinions on the movie, and the story of how it came to be made. In short, you should defintely watch this movie *at least* once, no matter who you are. ...Very Highly Recommended",5,thought provoking,1026518400,"07 13, 2002",2002,3525,"['reviewer', 'wfparish', 'sorry', 'i', 'spelled', 'incorrectly', 'hit', 'nail', 'right', 'thehead', 'quite', 'possibly', 'greatest', 'aspect', 'movie', 'WILL', 'make', 'think', 'make', 'question', 'how', 'live', 'quetion', 'benefits', 'society', 'especially', 'one', 'live', 'i', 'think', 'one', 'reasons', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'Many', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'have', 'beliefs', 'challenged', 'movie', 'wil', 'do', 'Also', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'shocked', 'violence', 'here', 'enitre', 'movie', '*one*', 'person', 'dies', 'same', 'people', 'sat', 'opening', 'scene', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'where', 'dozens', 'hundreds', 'people', 'were', 'brutally', 'killed', 'complaining', 'violence', 'just', 'different', 'context', 'entirely', 'justified', 'terms', 'movie.The', 'men', 'who', 'go', 'fight', 'club', 'go', 'reason', 'go', 'knowing', 'WILL', 'get', 'beaten', 'up', 'also', 'go', 'motivating', 'factor', 'FEEL', 'live', 'lives', 'feeling', 'nothing', 'just', 'doing', 'same', '*meaningless*', 'stuff', 'day', 'day', 'ae', 'searching', 'something', 'happiness', 'ultimately', 'path', 'society', 'take', 'be', 'happy', ""n't"", 'working', 'Fight', 'club', 'raw', 'emotion', 'take', 'be', 'happiness', 'Fight', 'Club', 'control', 'Project', 'Mayhem', 'see', 'consequences', 'path', 'protagonst', 'took', 'escape', '*evils*', 'society', 'path', 'took', 'only', 'possible', 'path', 'complaint', 'many', 'have', 'Norton', 'character', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'do', 'what', 'did', 'go', 'everything', 'went', 'thus', 'could', 'have', 'saved', 'many', 'people', 'lot', 'pain', 'answer', 'have', 'do', 'what', 'did', 'even', 'said', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'change', 'live', 'was', 'leading', 'only', 'knew', 'was', 'sick', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'joined', 'cause', 'What', 'did', 'was', ""n't"", 'ncessairily', 'RIGHT', 'question', 'should', 'ask', 'what', 'did', 'what', 'became', 'ultimately', 'better', 'life', 'would', 'have', 'led', 'would', ""'ve"", 'remained', 'little', 'cubicle', 'answr', 'may', 'surprse', 'i', 'think', 'main', 'idea', 'movie', 'instill', 'should', 'not', 'blindly', 'follow.The', 'movie', 'attacks', 'corporate', 'America', 'people', 'are', '*wasting*', 'lives', 'away', 'cublicles', 'media', 'attempts', 'quite', 'often', 'successful', 'make', 'conform', 'looking', 'Calvin', 'Klein', 'ad', 'muscular', 'man', 'underwear', 'Pitt', 'Tyler', 'Durden', 'Self', 'improvement', 'masturbation', 'Self', 'destruction', 'might', 'be', 'answer', 'not', 'see', 'true', 'up', 'alone', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'going', 'state', 'opinion', 'matter', 'what', 'see', 'movie', 'unbelivable', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'review', 'make', 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'bored', 'mind', 'i', 'just', 'tried', 'delve', 'deeper', 'what', 'movie', 'trying', 'say', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'David', 'Fincher', 'yet', 'again', 'done', 'tremendous', 'job', 'David', 'Uhls', 'brought', 'book', 'screen', 'splendidly', 'retaining', 'much', 'comedy', 'otherwise', 'rather', 'dark', 'movie', 'Ed', 'Norton', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'give', 'amazing', 'performances', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'DVD', 'packed', 'extremely', 'well', 'complete', 'pamphlet', 'entitled', 'how', 'start', 'fight', 'many', 'hollywood', 'opinions', 'movie', 'story', 'how', 'came', 'be', 'made', 'short', 'should', 'defintely', 'watch', 'movie', 'least*', 'once', 'matter', 'who', 'are', 'Very', 'Highly', 'Recommended']",N/A

518584,AR8Y6VPVUHCSB,B00003CWQ2,"Brad Torgersen ""Full-time nerd, part-time sol...","[4, 18]","Saw this movie last month.  Everyone ranted and raved about this movie (which I avoided seeing for a long time) and while I admit it has great acting and directing, and is very stylish, I was left holding an empty bag at the end of the film.  I won't spoil the &quot;surprise&quot; ending, but I will say I thought the wrap-up did nothing for me.Maybe I'm from the wrong generation?  But I was 24 in 1999 and I doubt even then I could have gotten into the &quot;message&quot; that this movie seems to deliver.  On the one hand, the message seems to be that we ought to abandon the conventional and live our lives as if every day will be our last.  Sort of a &quot;go for the gusto&quot; premise.  On the other hand the message seems to be that your modern young American male is condemned to a life utterly devoid of thumos, hence his only way to attain bona fide manhood is through senseless brutality?  I dunno, but speaking as a new father, husband of ten years, an Army Reservist, full-time employee, full time student, et al, there are more than enough &quot;dragons&quot; in this world to slay without having to engage in any of the nasty business portrayed in the film.The world is ripe with challenge, and any young male with half a brain ought to be able to find a hundred different things to engage himself in that will not only prove positively productive, but also extremely &quot;manly&quot; in every sense of the term.  Pitt's character whines that his generation has no great wars to fight?  Well, 9/11 knocked on our door, and it seems we have a doozy of a war on our hands now.  Pitt declares that you cannot plumb the true depth of your manhood without fighting?  In an age when young males are neck-deep in senseless slaughter, I would argue that unless the fighting is actually for something important (e.g. the real War that is on right at this very moment) the senseless barbarity of the 'fight club' is the furthest thing from manly virtue.Really, that's what I'm left with after watching this film.  Twist ending aside, what point was there to the 'fight club' anyway?  Yes, the film does seem to be something of a rant against our consumerist American culture, but we must remind ourselves that previous generations of young men worked hard and died hard so that we in this age could know comfort, safety, immense material well being, and few real hardships.  If this comfy life is a 'bad' thing that we men supposedly chaffe against, then it is news to me.  And for any young man out there who is looking for challenges and contests beyond the ordinary, I would refer him to his local Army, Navy, Marine, or Air Force recruiter.  The Service has a bottomless list of opportunities for young men to prove themselves, often in the manliest and most noble way possible, and it's all just a phone call away.Okay, enough with the commercial.

When it came out on video, I rented it, not knowing what  to expect.  But then by the end of the veiwing, I was amazed.  This was the  most inventive, and definitely the best film of 1999.  The plot was  amazing, focusing on these young men, with no place in society who fight  back, first by rebelling against themselves, going to an underground boxing  club, called Fight Club, created by the mysterious Tyler Durden(Brad Pitt)  and his friend(Edward Norton), who is never really named.  The narraration  of the film by Edward Norton is an excellent twist to the movie, and the  plot takes many turns, but the plot flows beautifully.  The creation of  Tyler's destruction path, code named Project Mayhem, is what is focused on  towards the end of the film.  The countless catchphrases and catchy lines  that are delivered by Brad Pitt are priceless.  The &quot;Recycle your  Pets&quot; bumper sticker gives me a laugh every time.  Also, the work of  Helena Bonham Carter in the film is not to be overlooked.  She plays the  junkie named Marla, who wanders into the narrarator's life, and won't  leave.  Then, she becomes attached to Tyler.  The concluding twenty minutes  of the movie is breathtaking, and the ending is spectacular.  The perks of  Edward Norton's character really bring him to life as it would seem if he  was a real person, because people really do have these little perks that  make them who they are.  The writing is stellar, adapted from the book  Fight Club, by Chuck Palahniuk, especially for a first time screenwriter.  The directing of David Fincher, always reliable, stands out here as his  best work to date.  This dethrones Seven as his best movie.  And Brad Pitt  is excellent as Tyler Durden, Edward Norton's best friend and enemy at the  same time.

As I listened to the commentary from Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, and David Fincher, I had a hard time imagining where the source of all the commotion came from. It is definitely a violent film but no more violent than a Halloween or Friday the 13th film. The difference between those films and a Rocky movie and this film is that the violence here is more realistic and brutal, anyone who has ever seen an actual street fight would identify more with this film. It doesn't feel as choreographed and phony. But at the same time these guys beat the crap out of each other and then hug and shake hands when it's over.As for the the film itself I thought it was interesting and entertaining. I didn't see it as a movie of a generation though. It was a movie where the people involved read more into it than is there. It was a very enjoyable movie as long as all of the outside garbage that comes with it can be tuned out. There's a lot of interesting camera work and unobtrusive computer graphics. The story is interesting and the screenplay is funny and dark. The lighting is dark also, which is my big complaint. I saw the film through my DVD player on a hotel t.v. I wasn't able to adjust the color on the set and in several scenes I had trouble seeing. In the commentary the two actors mention the director's habit of underlighting scenes.I was totally surprised by the twist and thought it was very well done and satisfying. The ending was a little unbelievable but not totally out of place with the tone of the movie, after all the whole thing is a little far fetched to begin with. The ending was a little weak though compared with the rest of the film.The DVD is full of interesting features and goodies. As usual the commentary track is a good idea in concept but doesn't live up to the potential. You occasionally learn something interesting but for the most part it's a case of everyone talking over one another. I haven't listened to all commentaries yet however, I'm hoping the screenwriter and director only tracks are a little more interesting. It's good to see Brad Pitt and Edward Norton criticizing Rosie O'Donnel.This is a good value and a good movie, I don't think it is as important as Edward Norton or some critics seem to think it is but it wasn't the signal of the end society either.

518590,APP5MBH2BSX6I,B00003CWQ2,"Brian Hulett ""okierazorbacker2""","[8, 10]","If you have ever felt anesthetized by modern life, bored with the world of 9 to 5 and sitcoms on the way to yawning yourself to sleep, or pondered if you could have ever become the stereotyped ""loner who becomes a serial killer"" if your life had turned out differently, ""Fight Club"" has some surprising things to say to you.This film was very badly promoted upon its 1999 release, showing only its title aspect, wherein young men meet in private to pummel one another into oblivion.  The surprise as a first-time viewer, years later, is that this is only the middle third of the story, a turning point for an anchorless character who apparently has no family or friends and isn't fond of his job, almost literally sleepwalking his way through a life devoted to filling his empty world with marginally interesting stuff and looking for something that might make him feel alive.The insomniac narrator of the film falls into a rather different circle of friends when his condo is blown to smithereens and he is forced to downgrade his lifestyle considerably.  His introduction to Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) and Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) further changes his life path, as our young automobile corporation risk assessment expert begins to reject his superficial, lonely life.  If we didn't grasp the obvious antimaterialistic tone of the script, we surely get it now, as it is literally pounded into our faces repeatedly.The dialogue during this first two-thirds of the film, prior to and including most of the story involving the actual club, is absolutely brilliant, crackling with wit, insight, and great one-liners.  ""We're a generation raised by women,"" Pitt says at one point, in reference to the male-only club.  ""I'm wondering if another woman is really the answer we need.""  And when Pitt tells his new friend he should get married, he says, ""I can't get married.  I'm a 30-year-old boy.""At some point this becomes a modern punk version of ""A Clockwork Orange,"" Durden and his club becoming a gang devoted to mayhem on a national scale, taking their anger and frustration to the streets, raising their aim from personal self-destruction to that of dragging the whole world down to their level.  The club becomes a rancid cult of personality, Durden's backward spirituality permeating those around him until they become, ironically, as faceless and drone-like as the corporate workers they pretend to care about ""freeing"" from their lives of 9 to 5 and sitcoms.But the plot twist at about the two-thirds spot of the film, while I never saw it coming, was a cheap device in my mind that completely ruined the film's earnest message for me.  An attempt to raise the bar of its own story, which was fine on its own, this twist (far be it from me to reveal anything here) came off as nothing more than an unwelcome intruder and unnecessary complication that only caused me to lose interest in what had been an unusually original, thought-provoking, brutal (in both the good and bad senses of that word) experience.It basically goes downhill from there, apparently trying very hard to sell the idea that said plot twist is a real part of the story and not just another manipulation on the part of one main character.  By this time, as a viewer, I was totally lost to the story, as the film became something else entirely, spiraling down to an inexplicable ending that only leaves one saying, ""Huh?""I will certainly give ""Fight Club"" credit for its originality.  And again, it is brilliant in the extreme for its first two-thirds.  Certainly not recommended for anyone under 18, nor for the squeamish of any age, ""Fight Club"" is worth seeing for its clever camera tricks and editing, for its social commentary, and mostly for the remarkable prose of the words put into the actors' mouths by screenwriter Jim Uhls, based on a novel by Chuck Palahniuk.But the final 45 minutes or so really ruins what could have been a gripping classic piece of punk cinema, rather than the severely flawed underground cult favorite it has become.  Still, if the so-called ""brilliant plot twist"" were removed and the ending had been untwisted and come about a half-hour sooner, this would clearly be a five-star winner.Kinda like having a great steak dinner with burnt toast for dessert.......",3,Two-thirds of a brilliant film,1095638400,"09 20, 2004",2004,4279,"['have', 'ever', 'felt', 'anesthetized', 'modern', 'life', 'bored', 'world', '9', '5', 'sitcoms', 'way', 'yawning', 'sleep', 'pondered', 'could', 'have', 'ever', 'become', 'stereotyped', 'loner', 'who', 'serial', 'killer', 'life', 'had', 'turned', 'out', 'differently', 'Fight', 'Club', 'surprising', 'things', 'say', 'you.This', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'badly', 'promoted', '1999', 'release', 'showing', 'only', 'title', 'aspect', 'wherein', 'young', 'men', 'meet', 'private', 'pummel', 'one', 'oblivion', 'surprise', 'first-time', 'viewer', 'years', 'later', 'only', 'middle', 'third', 'story', 'turning', 'point', 'anchorless', 'character', 'who', 'apparently', 'family', 'friends', ""n't"", 'fond', 'job', 'almost', 'literally', 'sleepwalking', 'way', 'life', 'devoted', 'filling', 'empty', 'world', 'marginally', 'interesting', 'stuff', 'looking', 'something', 'might', 'make', 'feel', 'alive.The', 'insomniac', 'narrator', 'film', 'rather', 'different', 'circle', 'friends', 'when', 'condo', 'blown', 'smithereens', 'forced', 'downgrade', 'lifestyle', 'considerably', 'introduction', 'Tyler', 'Durden', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Marla', 'Singer', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'further', 'life', 'path', 'young', 'automobile', 'corporation', 'risk', 'assessment', 'expert', 'reject', 'superficial', 'lonely', 'life', 'did', ""n't"", 'grasp', 'obvious', 'antimaterialistic', 'tone', 'script', 'surely', 'get', 'now', 'literally', 'pounded', 'repeatedly.The', 'dialogue', 'first', 'two-thirds', 'film', 'prior', 'including', 'most', 'story', 'involving', 'actual', 'club', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'crackling', 'wit', 'insight', 'great', 'one-liners', ""'re"", 'generation', 'raised', 'women', 'Pitt', 'one', 'point', 'reference', 'male-only', 'club', ""'m"", 'wondering', 'woman', 'really', 'answer', 'need', 'when', 'Pitt', 'new', 'friend', 'should', 'get', 'married', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'married', ""'m"", '30-year-old', 'boy', 'point', 'modern', 'punk', 'version', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'Durden', 'club', 'becoming', 'gang', 'devoted', 'mayhem', 'national', 'scale', 'taking', 'anger', 'frustration', 'streets', 'raising', 'aim', 'personal', 'self-destruction', 'dragging', 'whole', 'world', 'level', 'club', 'rancid', 'cult', 'personality', 'Durden', 'backward', 'spirituality', 'permeating', 'become', 'ironically', 'faceless', 'drone-like', 'corporate', 'workers', 'pretend', 'care', 'freeing', 'lives', '9', '5', 'sitcoms.But', 'plot', 'twist', 'two-thirds', 'spot', 'film', 'never', 'saw', 'coming', 'was', 'cheap', 'device', 'mind', 'completely', 'ruined', 'film', 'earnest', 'message', 'attempt', 'raise', 'bar', 'own', 'story', 'was', 'fine', 'own', 'twist', 'far', 'be', 'reveal', 'anything', 'here', 'came', 'off', 'nothing', 'more', 'unwelcome', 'intruder', 'unnecessary', 'complication', 'only', 'caused', 'lose', 'interest', 'what', 'had', 'been', 'unusually', 'original', 'thought-provoking', 'brutal', 'good', 'bad', 'senses', 'word', 'basically', 'downhill', 'there', 'apparently', 'trying', 'very', 'hard', 'sell', 'idea', 'said', 'plot', 'twist', 'real', 'part', 'story', 'not', 'just', 'manipulation', 'part', 'one', 'main', 'character', 'time', 'viewer', 'was', 'totally', 'lost', 'story', 'film', 'became', 'something', 'else', 'entirely', 'spiraling', 'down', 'inexplicable', 'ending', 'only', 'one', 'saying', 'Huh', 'will', 'certainly', 'give', 'Fight', 'Club', 'credit', 'originality', 'again', 'brilliant', 'extreme', 'first', 'two-thirds', 'Certainly', 'not', 'recommended', 'anyone', '18', 'squeamish', 'age', 'Fight', 'Club', 'worth', 'seeing', 'clever', 'camera', 'tricks', 'editing', 'social', 'commentary', 'mostly', 'remarkable', 'prose', 'words', 'put', 'actors', 'mouths', 'screenwriter', 'Jim', 'Uhls', 'based', 'novel', 'Chuck', 'Palahniuk.But', 'final', '45', 'minutes', 'so', 'really', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'gripping', 'classic', 'piece', 'punk', 'cinema', 'rather', 'severely', 'flawed', 'underground', 'cult', 'favorite', 'become', 'Still', 'so-called', 'brilliant', 'plot', 'twist', 'were', 'removed', 'ending', 'had', 'been', 'untwisted', 'come', 'half-hour', 'sooner', 'would', 'clearly', 'be', 'five-star', 'winner.Kinda', 'having', 'great', 'steak', 'dinner', 'burnt', 'toast', 'dessert']",N/A

It blows the mind!  Edward Norton plays the un-named narrator and average-guy insomniac who becomes obsessed with self-help groups,  though nothing is seriously wrong with him.  When he meets another &quot;faker&quot; as he calls himself,  he becomes mixed up with Marla Singer(Helena Bonham Carter),  a chain smoker with suicidal tendencies.  Norton flies around the country assessing car damages for his job,  and on a particular flight he meets Tyler Durden(Brad Pitt).  Tyler is the epitome of stylish,  cool,  and without a doubt the one man who can do anything.  Norton's apartment mysteriouly explodes,  and Durden allows Norton to stay with him.  Together,  they discover a certain animal pleasure in fighting.  They form an underground FIGHT CLUB where men meet and simply fight each other.  Soon however,  this organization will become much more than just a club.  Edward Norton gives a phenomenal and mesmerizing performance and establishes himself as one of the best young actors of our generation.  Brad Pitt is simply amazing as Durden, playing a role that only a gifted actor could accomplish.  Helena Bonham Carter gives a surprisingly powerful performance as Marla and gives the character tons of dimension.  Also great is the supporting performace by Meatloaf,  an ex-bodybuilder with testicular cancer.

You can disagree with me if you are not the ""artsy-fartsy"" type (like me), but the truth remains the same, this film had a point, made the point and took no prisoners along the way.So, live a little, and watch this movie. Then go out and make something of yourself. Even if you don't get to beat the crap out of someone for fun.",5,Epic depiction of gen-x and our lack of living!

518600,A3HTX1NOTTWERP,B00003CWQ2,Busy Body,"[5, 7]","Fight Club. Wow, what more can I say? It has to be one of the greatest films I have ever seen in my whole life for so many amazing reasons. It is a brilliantly-acted, superbly-portrayed, beautifully captured, complex masterpiece that was easily the film of 1999. Forget the Matrix and Star Wars for a minute and watch this. You'll soon see that special effects aren't everything and that all you need is a mind-blowing script like the one on display here to make a seismic impact. The film is riddled with dark humor and sharp quotes, violent action and emotional turmoil all of which result in the demise of one man's descent into madness as the approaching millennium beckons. Upon its release the film made a big impact by word-of-mouth, but was harshly snubbed by many award show judges. In the past five years, however, it has gone on to become an uncalculated masterpiece of the highest order that not only appeals to a wide audience, but teaches a strict lesson about the fabrication and consumer-obsessed society that we live in.Edward Norton plays Jack, a man on the verge of being the biggest loser in the world. With no friends or family and stuck in a dead-end job, he turns to victim support groups. The man suffers terrible insomnia and feeds off the depression that the other group members pour forth. His apartment later explodes, forcing him to turn to a man whom he first meets on a plane...The man is of course Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) and in all his cocky arrogance and fast-paced way of life makes a big impression on Jack. Tyler is the complete embodiment of the guy who is bad, but we love him because of it. He steals fat from liposuction clinics which he makes into soap, before selling it back to the rich and fat ladies it once came from; urinates in the soup of the restaurant in which he works; and splices single frames of pornography into family movies. He has one main motivation in life: to disrupt social ethics and the way in which we live our lives. The people with the typical SUV, the 2.4 children and the idyllic lifestyle that everyone wants.The two man are complete opposites - day and night, as it were. Jack moves in with Tyler when his place is destroyed, and soon finds his life completely changing. When Jack gets talked into a fight with Tyler, he is amazed by how raw and primal he feels from inside. And the rest is history. ""Fight Club"" is formed, a secret underground society where men meet, one-on-one prepared to go head to head bare-knuckles style. The first rule of Fight Club is: ""You do not talk about Fight Club."" The second rule is the same. You get the picture.Helena Bonham Carter is really fantastic as Marla, who is another fake visiting social victim groups when she meets Jack. She drives him crazy, and the rest of the plot is pretty much too hard for me to explain. I've only seen this film twice, bt I still have a hard time explaining what lies beneath it. The genius at work, director David Fincher, has created an intricate and glowing masterpiece that unfortunately gained a reputation as a guy-film because of the violence. It's anything but, and I encourage anyone who enjoys films such as American Beauty to watch it - not for the violence, but for the lesson you'll undoubtedly learn from society's fabrication.You can't really watch this film without seeing how beautifully-filmed it is. Filled with dark and brooding colours and tones of blues and blacks, we get a perfect view of the society in which Tyler and Jack inhabit. Most of the scenes take place at night and the run-down city just reflects the storyline completely. There's also the eye-candy on offer: I don't want to sound clich&eacute;, but Brad Pitt is just so beautiful in this film! There isn't a hotter man alive on the face of the Earth, and this factor alone makes it worth watching a million times, especially the scenes where he's in the bathtub, bedroom, dressing gown, etc. Yum yum!OVERALL GRADE: 10/10Fight Club was criticised because of its violence, but for me I can't really see what a fuss people were making of it. Yeah, it deserved its rating and it's not suitable for children, but I truly believe that there's nothing stomach-churning in this film that would make the faint-hearted squeamish! The film makes an impact right from the start and Jack's smart narration is a part of this completely. I haven't revealed the twist that this movie contains, but it's really smart and very well-done. Without knowning what this twist is, you might think that this is just another movie, but you'd be wrong. View it for what it is: a sharp and bright look at society and the ways in which we are told to live.",5,Brad Pitt Sizzles In His Greatest Film Role To Date!,1085097600,"05 21, 2004",2004,4661,"['Fight', 'Club', 'Wow', 'what', 'more', 'can', 'say', 'be', 'one', 'greatest', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'whole', 'life', 'so', 'many', 'amazing', 'reasons', 'brilliantly-acted', 'superbly-portrayed', 'beautifully', 'captured', 'complex', 'masterpiece', 'was', 'easily', 'film', '1999', 'Forget', 'Matrix', 'Star', 'Wars', 'minute', 'watch', ""'ll"", 'soon', 'see', 'special', 'effects', 'are', ""n't"", 'everything', 'need', 'mind-blowing', 'script', 'one', 'display', 'here', 'make', 'seismic', 'impact', 'film', 'riddled', 'dark', 'humor', 'sharp', 'quotes', 'violent', 'action', 'emotional', 'turmoil', 'result', 'demise', 'one', 'man', 'descent', 'madness', 'approaching', 'millennium', 'beckons', 'release', 'film', 'made', 'big', 'impact', 'word-of-mouth', 'was', 'harshly', 'snubbed', 'many', 'award', 'show', 'judges', 'past', 'five', 'years', 'however', 'gone', 'become', 'uncalculated', 'masterpiece', 'highest', 'order', 'not', 'only', 'appeals', 'wide', 'audience', 'strict', 'lesson', 'fabrication', 'consumer-obsessed', 'society', 'live', 'in.Edward', 'Norton', 'Jack', 'man', 'verge', 'being', 'biggest', 'loser', 'world', 'friends', 'family', 'stuck', 'dead-end', 'job', 'victim', 'support', 'groups', 'man', 'terrible', 'insomnia', 'feeds', 'off', 'depression', 'other', 'group', 'members', 'pour', 'forth', 'apartment', 'later', 'forcing', 'turn', 'man', 'whom', 'first', 'plane', 'man', 'course', 'Tyler', 'Durden', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'cocky', 'arrogance', 'fast-paced', 'way', 'life', 'big', 'impression', 'Jack', 'Tyler', 'complete', 'embodiment', 'guy', 'who', 'bad', 'love', 'fat', 'liposuction', 'clinics', 'soap', 'selling', 'back', 'rich', 'fat', 'ladies', 'once', 'came', 'urinates', 'soup', 'restaurant', 'splices', 'single', 'frames', 'pornography', 'family', 'movies', 'one', 'main', 'motivation', 'life', 'disrupt', 'social', 'ethics', 'way', 'live', 'lives', 'people', 'typical', 'SUV', '2.4', 'children', 'idyllic', 'lifestyle', 'everyone', 'wants.The', 'two', 'man', 'are', 'complete', 'opposites', 'day', 'night', 'were', 'Jack', 'Tyler', 'when', 'place', 'destroyed', 'soon', 'life', 'completely', 'changing', 'When', 'Jack', 'talked', 'fight', 'Tyler', 'amazed', 'how', 'raw', 'primal', 'inside', 'rest', 'history', 'Fight', 'Club', 'formed', 'secret', 'underground', 'society', 'where', 'men', 'meet', 'one-on-one', 'prepared', 'go', 'head', 'head', 'bare-knuckles', 'style', 'first', 'rule', 'Fight', 'Club', 'do', 'not', 'talk', 'Fight', 'Club', 'second', 'rule', 'same', 'get', 'picture.Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'really', 'fantastic', 'Marla', 'who', 'fake', 'visiting', 'social', 'victim', 'groups', 'when', 'Jack', 'crazy', 'rest', 'plot', 'pretty', 'much', 'too', 'hard', 'explain', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'film', 'twice', 'bt', 'still', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'explaining', 'what', 'beneath', 'genius', 'work', 'director', 'David', 'Fincher', 'created', 'intricate', 'glowing', 'masterpiece', 'unfortunately', 'gained', 'reputation', 'guy-film', 'violence', 'anything', 'encourage', 'anyone', 'who', 'films', 'such', 'American', 'Beauty', 'watch', 'not', 'violence', 'lesson', ""'ll"", 'undoubtedly', 'learn', 'society', 'fabrication.You', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'watch', 'film', 'seeing', 'how', 'beautifully-filmed', 'Filled', 'dark', 'brooding', 'colours', 'tones', 'blues', 'blacks', 'get', 'perfect', 'view', 'society', 'Tyler', 'Jack', 'inhabit', 'Most', 'scenes', 'take', 'place', 'night', 'run-down', 'city', 'just', 'storyline', 'completely', 'also', 'eye-candy', 'offer', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'sound', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'just', 'so', 'beautiful', 'film', ""n't"", 'hotter', 'man', 'alive', 'face', 'Earth', 'factor', 'alone', 'worth', 'watching', 'million', 'times', 'especially', 'scenes', 'where', 'bathtub', 'bedroom', 'dressing', 'gown', 'etc', 'yum', 'OVERALL', 'GRADE', '10/10Fight', 'Club', 'was', 'criticised', 'violence', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'what', 'fuss', 'people', 'were', 'making', 'Yeah', 'deserved', 'rating', 'not', 'suitable', 'children', 'truly', 'believe', 'nothing', 'stomach-churning', 'film', 'would', 'make', 'faint-hearted', 'squeamish', 'film', 'impact', 'right', 'start', 'Jack', 'smart', 'narration', 'part', 'completely', 'have', ""n't"", 'revealed', 'twist', 'movie', 'really', 'smart', 'very', 'well-done', 'knowning', 'what', 'twist', 'might', 'think', 'just', 'movie', ""'d"", 'be', 'wrong', 'View', 'what', 'sharp', 'bright', 'look', 'society', 'ways', 'are', 'told', 'live']",N/A

Well I tell you, I own over 70 DVD's already, and Fight Club in my opinion is among the best all-around DVD.  Read on to find out why.Aside from the movie (which in this case is great), I look at other key factors in DVD's: the sound, the picture quality, and the extra features.  This baby has it all.  Clean and clear picture transfer that you should expect in any DVD.  This one is among the best.  And the extras?  Tons and tons!  Not only is there a great quantity of material (an entire second disc devoted to it), but it's great QUALITY bonus material as well.  Presentation is excellent.  Some DVD's simply give you a special type of experience becuase of the style and presentation used, and this is one of them.  Now let me get to the best part-  The sound.  I'm a sound freak, and I appreciate great sound.  If you have a good sound setup with 5.1 surround, you'll love Fight Club.  They did a great job on the mixing board with this one.

It may have had something to do with how the film was marketed: It looked like it was about a bunch of guys beating the living crap out of each other in an effort to vent their post-modern frustrations, with some other plot line involving terrorism thrown in.Of course, ""Fight Club"" is much, MUCH more than that. Yet to say much more than that would be to, ahem, violate Rule #1 of Fight Club, which is: ""You DON'T talk about Fight Club."" But now that I've decided to take the plunge and watch this film, I've been talking about ""Fight Club"" a whole LOT.Here's a film that is stylish, smart, often preposterous, and makes me want to pay a lot closer attention to the career of director David Fincher, because he's a guy with some true artistic vision. Here's a film that, after you've finished watching, makes you say to yourself, ""Gee, now I'll have to watch it all over again!"" Here's a film that is equal parts psychological study and anarchist's wet dream. Sensitive moviegoers ought to be warned, though: ""Fight Club"" is not for the faint of heart: It is a very violent and provocative adult film. It also has some of the most hysterical OFF-screen sex scenes I've ever heard!

518604,AKV2BGUT50B1X,B00003CWQ2,Carl Robinson,"[0, 0]","When the famous American Explorer team of Lewis and Clark went up the Missouri River to explore the Louisiana Purchase, part of their job was to inform the Indian Tribes that they were now under the jurisdiction of the United States and these tribes should cease to make war on each other.  The old chiefs, diplomatic and calm as most older men are agreed, but often replied that tribal leadership was based on valor in war. Without war, they reasoned how would they select new leaders?Fight Club explores this theme.  Men are often at their best when they are in conflict, and for a great many men, the modern world is one of cubicles, shopping malls, and feminine nagging.Enter the Fight Club's un-named Narrator (Edward Norton).  He works in a dead-end, morally bankrupt, and emasculating job, his natural masculine aggression is channeled into an empty consumerism.  In this mode, his moral yearnings are satisfied by ""fair trade"" marketing gimmicks so enjoyed by the upwardly mobile.  This spiritual rut leads to insomnia.The vague, soul-less wandering of the Narrator is emphasized by the location of the movie-although not named it is Wilmington, Delaware.  More often than not, Wilmington is the final destination of all one's credit card payments.  Wilmington is a city where dollars flow to glittering corporate banking headquarters skyscrapers surrounded by a dull rust belt state on the Atlantic Coast.  A drive through central Delaware on US 13 is to take a tour of abandoned houses and crumbling infrastructure.  Delaware also lacks the moral force of Puritan New England and the noble, romantic dash of Dixie.In an effort to combat his sleeplessness, he starts attending support groups.  After visiting Remaining Men Together, a group for men who've lost their testicles to cancer, he has a breakthrough and he is able to sleep and keep in his rut.  What stops him is when he meets Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), a wildcat of a woman who is likewise unfulfilled in a primal way.  His insomnia returns.On a business trip, the Narrator meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), and the pair eventually move in together to an abandoned Urban Prairie type of house and create a club where men can fight and thereby re-claim their manhood.  The club grows into a spiritual movement centered around wreaking the soul-less corporate, consumerism that they find so oppressive.  The climax of the movie is a mind-bending plot twist with a denouement that reconciles the narrator's relationship with both Tyler Durden and Marla Singer.Through the movie there is a dark sexual expression that is of the un-reproductive varieties which add to the barren feel of the culture being raged against.  There are several references to dildos and homosexual tension is woven throughout the relationship between Tyler Durden and the Narrator.  Indeed, the story is brought to climax, the narrator supposes, by sexual jealousies.This movie has inspired a great many men to re-evaluate their comfortable existence and there are blogs and internet postings that bemoan the fact that you can't hunt deer in the shadow of the abandoned Sears Tower.  These men in many ways miss the point.  The United States has been at war for more than a decade, there are plenty of opportunities to get involved with fighting.  There are also many immoral causes that the corporate/Beltway Political elites carry out that can be brought to account.  In this regard the movie should be seen as an inspiring call to arms rather than mere complaining.",5,Fight Club-The Cris de Coeur of Modern American Men,1363737600,"03 20, 2013",2013,3519,"['When', 'famous', 'American', 'Explorer', 'team', 'Lewis', 'Clark', 'went', 'up', 'Missouri', 'River', 'explore', 'Louisiana', 'Purchase', 'part', 'job', 'was', 'inform', 'Indian', 'Tribes', 'were', 'now', 'jurisdiction', 'United', 'States', 'tribes', 'should', 'cease', 'make', 'war', 'other', 'old', 'chiefs', 'diplomatic', 'calm', 'most', 'older', 'men', 'are', 'agreed', 'often', 'replied', 'tribal', 'leadership', 'was', 'based', 'valor', 'war', 'war', 'reasoned', 'how', 'would', 'select', 'new', 'leaders', 'Fight', 'Club', 'theme', 'Men', 'are', 'often', 'best', 'when', 'are', 'conflict', 'great', 'many', 'men', 'modern', 'world', 'one', 'cubicles', 'shopping', 'malls', 'feminine', 'nagging.Enter', 'Fight', 'Club', 'un-named', 'Narrator', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'dead-end', 'morally', 'bankrupt', 'emasculating', 'job', 'natural', 'masculine', 'aggression', 'channeled', 'empty', 'consumerism', 'mode', 'moral', 'yearnings', 'are', 'satisfied', 'fair', 'trade', 'marketing', 'gimmicks', 'so', 'enjoyed', 'upwardly', 'mobile', 'spiritual', 'rut', 'insomnia.The', 'vague', 'soul-less', 'wandering', 'Narrator', 'emphasized', 'location', 'movie-although', 'not', 'named', 'Wilmington', 'Delaware', 'More', 'often', 'not', 'Wilmington', 'final', 'destination', 'one', 'credit', 'card', 'payments', 'Wilmington', 'city', 'where', 'dollars', 'flow', 'glittering', 'corporate', 'banking', 'headquarters', 'skyscrapers', 'surrounded', 'dull', 'rust', 'belt', 'state', 'Atlantic', 'Coast', 'drive', 'central', 'Delaware', 'US', '13', 'take', 'tour', 'abandoned', 'houses', 'crumbling', 'infrastructure', 'Delaware', 'also', 'moral', 'force', 'Puritan', 'New', 'England', 'noble', 'romantic', 'dash', 'Dixie.In', 'effort', 'combat', 'sleeplessness', 'attending', 'support', 'groups', 'visiting', 'Remaining', 'Men', 'Together', 'group', 'men', 'who', ""'ve"", 'lost', 'testicles', 'cancer', 'breakthrough', 'able', 'sleep', 'keep', 'rut', 'What', 'when', 'Marla', 'Singer', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'wildcat', 'woman', 'who', 'likewise', 'unfulfilled', 'primal', 'way', 'insomnia', 'business', 'trip', 'Narrator', 'Tyler', 'Durden', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'pair', 'eventually', 'move', 'together', 'abandoned', 'Urban', 'Prairie', 'type', 'house', 'create', 'club', 'where', 'men', 'can', 'fight', 'thereby', 're-claim', 'manhood', 'club', 'spiritual', 'movement', 'centered', 'wreaking', 'soul-less', 'corporate', 'consumerism', 'find', 'so', 'oppressive', 'climax', 'movie', 'mind-bending', 'plot', 'twist', 'denouement', 'narrator', 'relationship', 'Tyler', 'Durden', 'Marla', 'Singer.Through', 'movie', 'dark', 'sexual', 'expression', 'un-reproductive', 'varieties', 'add', 'barren', 'feel', 'culture', 'being', 'raged', 'are', 'several', 'references', 'dildos', 'homosexual', 'tension', 'woven', 'relationship', 'Tyler', 'Durden', 'Narrator', 'Indeed', 'story', 'brought', 'climax', 'narrator', 'supposes', 'sexual', 'jealousies.This', 'movie', 'inspired', 'great', 'many', 'men', 're-evaluate', 'comfortable', 'existence', 'are', 'blogs', 'internet', 'postings', 'bemoan', 'fact', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hunt', 'deer', 'shadow', 'abandoned', 'Sears', 'Tower', 'men', 'many', 'ways', 'miss', 'point', 'United', 'States', 'been', 'war', 'more', 'decade', 'are', 'plenty', 'opportunities', 'get', 'involved', 'fighting', 'are', 'also', 'many', 'immoral', 'causes', 'corporate/Beltway', 'Political', 'elites', 'carry', 'out', 'can', 'be', 'brought', 'account', 'regard', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'inspiring', 'call', 'arms', 'rather', 'mere', 'complaining']",N/A

He brings the character to life, and playing some one depressed, that is a hard job. Brad Pitt is amazing and could be his best role. When you watch Helena Bonham Carter you'll see why she always play roles like these; she's perfect. The cinematography is dark and run down, just what you would expect from David Fincher. Most of the sets will stay with, like the apartment, the house in which Tyler and The Narrator stay in, and the bar that Fight Club goes on in. The writing is voracious and almost hard to swallow, which is how it was made. The story focuses on agression and civilization and how it should be torn down. The twist at the end of the story is famous, and the plot is smart and instantaneous, keeping viewers hooked.It falls nothing short of it's reputation.

He would go for days without sleep even though he was working a  corporate job.  When the doctor told him the way to get well was to start  attending support groups for diseases he didn't have, I knew that this  movie was really trying something different.

518609,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B00003CWQ2,C. B Collins Jr.,"[4, 4]","What is the role of a man in modern society? What happens when a man searching for some relevance loses his way and goes down the wrong path, and I mean the really wrong path? What emotions will society allow a man to express and under what conditions? If man can't show external signs of emotional pain, what leads him to crave physical pain?  Where are the valid models of masculinity and manhood in our stereotypical consumerism society? Why do men struggle for independence while simultaneously longing to join the pack? How do men redirect or repress anger so they can function in society?  How does modern man cope with the loss of the aggressive, primitive, warrior masculine archetype that haunts our genes? All of these issues are explored in Fight Club.  Despite the violence, this satire and social commentary is highly entertaining.Ed Norton is superb as a young man trying to make sense of his world by maintaining a 9 to 5 job, traveling for work to non-descript towns, restaurants, and hotels, buying a condo and furnishing the condo in a manner that shows he knows what is hip. He grows increasingly hostile to his supervisor and his job. Numb to this world and finding that he has no real meaning in life or outlet for his emotions or feelings of connection, he begins joining 12 step programs and disease/survivor support groups.He joins the testicular cancer support group where men mourn the loss of their testicles and cry in each other's arms. Thus, in a prescribed time and place and condition, men may cry. They can cry over the loss of their manhood, their virility, and their fertility.  But these men are mocked in the film for they choose to cry instead of howling. They show emotional pain rather than crave physical pain as the release of their internal pain.Our narrator meets a young odd woman who craves human connection by attending endless 12 step and support group meetings, just like the narrator. Helen Bonham-Carter plays this role extremely well. So well does she take on this character that this may be one of her strongest performances on film. Wouldn't you think that two young people who crave human contact and genuine emotion so much that they attend endless meetings would find each other? Of course they can't for they don't even know what ails them. They even arrange to attend alternating meetings so that they don't run into each other. Why? Because they may experience genuine emotion should they open themselves to each other.Then Tyler Durden comes into the scene. He is the narrator's image of masculinity; roughly handsome, arrogant, brash, sarcastic quick wit, fights, doesn't really work because he thinks he can outwit the system, can take a beating, has wild sex, and is firmly grounded in an atheistic bleak existential personal philosophy drenched with nihilism. We have seen this character before in the novels of Paul Bowles and Cormack McCarthy. This archetype never ceases to amuse.So many themes emerge in this fast paced film. Tyler begins to introduce our narrator to the fight club, an outlet for their aggression and inner pain. For in beating the hell out of each other men release their aggressive impulses and the genuine physical pain is far more real and preferable than any inner existential pain.  The fight club is a gift for these men.How does a healthy society deal with these impulses? Organized sports and game hunting come to mind. These young men also provide the raw materials for military war machines. But for those men that don't fit into the role of hunter, soldier, or jock; the draw to the fight club is understandable. But once in the fight club, how does this process morph into anarchy and terrorism?  Why do rebellious young men need to be beat and mastered by a leader? How do they come to believe that submission to the power of a hierarchy is a sign of manhood and allow their aggressive urges to be maintained and directed?In the scene where the narrator's hand is burned by lye, we hear Freud's theory of God as a father projection. In casual conversation the narrator and Tyler discuss wishing they could fist fight Hemmingway, Gandhi, and Lincoln.  After a car wreck, Tyler says they had a 'near life experience'. Such odds and ends are woven throughout the film.In the end, this is sometimes a hard film to watch, but underneath the satire and violence is nested essential existential questions. We may have answered many of the questions for ourselves and can sleep at night, but as a society we certainly have not answered the questions.",4,Dark social commentary,1210464000,"05 11, 2008",2008,4543,"['What', 'role', 'man', 'modern', 'society', 'What', 'when', 'man', 'searching', 'relevance', 'way', 'down', 'wrong', 'path', 'mean', 'really', 'wrong', 'path', 'What', 'emotions', 'will', 'society', 'allow', 'man', 'express', 'what', 'conditions', 'man', 'ca', ""n't"", 'show', 'external', 'signs', 'emotional', 'pain', 'what', 'crave', 'physical', 'pain', 'Where', 'are', 'valid', 'models', 'masculinity', 'manhood', 'stereotypical', 'consumerism', 'society', 'Why', 'do', 'men', 'struggle', 'independence', 'simultaneously', 'longing', 'join', 'pack', 'How', 'do', 'men', 'redirect', 'repress', 'anger', 'can', 'function', 'society', 'How', 'modern', 'man', 'cope', 'loss', 'aggressive', 'primitive', 'warrior', 'masculine', 'archetype', 'genes', 'issues', 'are', 'explored', 'Fight', 'Club', 'violence', 'satire', 'social', 'commentary', 'highly', 'entertaining.Ed', 'Norton', 'superb', 'young', 'man', 'trying', 'make', 'sense', 'world', 'maintaining', '9', '5', 'job', 'traveling', 'work', 'non-descript', 'towns', 'restaurants', 'hotels', 'buying', 'condo', 'furnishing', 'condo', 'manner', 'what', 'hip', 'increasingly', 'hostile', 'supervisor', 'job', 'Numb', 'world', 'finding', 'real', 'meaning', 'life', 'outlet', 'emotions', 'feelings', 'connection', 'joining', '12', 'step', 'programs', 'disease/survivor', 'support', 'groups.He', 'testicular', 'cancer', 'support', 'group', 'where', 'men', 'mourn', 'loss', 'testicles', 'cry', 'other', 'arms', 'Thus', 'prescribed', 'time', 'place', 'condition', 'men', 'may', 'cry', 'can', 'cry', 'loss', 'manhood', 'virility', 'fertility', 'men', 'are', 'mocked', 'film', 'choose', 'cry', 'instead', 'howling', 'show', 'emotional', 'pain', 'rather', 'crave', 'physical', 'pain', 'release', 'internal', 'pain.Our', 'narrator', 'young', 'odd', 'woman', 'who', 'human', 'connection', 'attending', 'endless', '12', 'step', 'support', 'group', 'meetings', 'just', 'narrator', 'Helen', 'Bonham-Carter', 'role', 'extremely', 'well', 'So', 'well', 'take', 'character', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'strongest', 'performances', 'film', 'Would', ""n't"", 'think', 'two', 'young', 'people', 'who', 'crave', 'human', 'contact', 'genuine', 'emotion', 'so', 'much', 'attend', 'endless', 'meetings', 'would', 'find', 'other', 'course', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'what', 'even', 'arrange', 'attend', 'alternating', 'meetings', 'do', ""n't"", 'run', 'other', 'Why', 'may', 'experience', 'genuine', 'emotion', 'should', 'open', 'other.Then', 'Tyler', 'Durden', 'scene', 'narrator', 'image', 'masculinity', 'roughly', 'handsome', 'arrogant', 'brash', 'sarcastic', 'quick', 'wit', 'fights', ""n't"", 'really', 'work', 'can', 'outwit', 'system', 'can', 'take', 'beating', 'wild', 'sex', 'firmly', 'grounded', 'atheistic', 'bleak', 'existential', 'personal', 'philosophy', 'drenched', 'nihilism', 'have', 'seen', 'character', 'novels', 'Paul', 'Bowles', 'Cormack', 'McCarthy', 'archetype', 'never', 'amuse.So', 'many', 'themes', 'emerge', 'fast', 'paced', 'film', 'Tyler', 'introduce', 'narrator', 'fight', 'club', 'outlet', 'aggression', 'inner', 'pain', 'beating', 'hell', 'other', 'men', 'release', 'aggressive', 'impulses', 'genuine', 'physical', 'pain', 'far', 'more', 'real', 'preferable', 'inner', 'existential', 'pain', 'fight', 'club', 'gift', 'men.How', 'healthy', 'society', 'deal', 'impulses', 'Organized', 'sports', 'game', 'hunting', 'come', 'mind', 'young', 'men', 'also', 'provide', 'raw', 'materials', 'military', 'war', 'machines', 'men', 'do', ""n't"", 'fit', 'role', 'hunter', 'soldier', 'jock', 'draw', 'fight', 'club', 'understandable', 'once', 'fight', 'club', 'how', 'process', 'morph', 'anarchy', 'terrorism', 'Why', 'do', 'rebellious', 'young', 'men', 'need', 'be', 'beat', 'mastered', 'leader', 'How', 'do', 'come', 'believe', 'submission', 'power', 'hierarchy', 'sign', 'manhood', 'allow', 'aggressive', 'urges', 'be', 'maintained', 'directed', 'scene', 'where', 'narrator', 'hand', 'burned', 'lye', 'hear', 'Freud', 'theory', 'God', 'father', 'projection', 'casual', 'conversation', 'narrator', 'Tyler', 'discuss', 'wishing', 'could', 'fist', 'fight', 'Hemmingway', 'Gandhi', 'Lincoln', 'car', 'wreck', 'Tyler', 'had', ""'near"", 'life', 'experience', 'Such', 'odds', 'ends', 'are', 'woven', 'film.In', 'end', 'sometimes', 'hard', 'film', 'watch', 'satire', 'violence', 'nested', 'essential', 'existential', 'questions', 'may', 'have', 'answered', 'many', 'questions', 'ourselves', 'can', 'sleep', 'night', 'society', 'certainly', 'have', 'not', 'answered', 'questions']",N/A

518611,A17N23WXA7EAF,B00003CWQ2,"C. Colt ""It Just Doesn't Matter""","[3, 3]","In a way, ""Fight Club"" is the rough, often brutal, and intensely masculine counter part to ""American Beauty"".  Both films examine contemporary, American, middle class society and both argue that its raison d'tre is  predicated on a false set of values. In ""American Beauty"" many of the  characters mire themselves in worthless distractions and intense denial in  order to achieve happiness within the limitations of middle class society.  ""Fight Club"" asks why we should work at jobs we hate to buy stuff that we  don't need and then offers a defiant answer. We shouldn't. Instead, we  should define our self-interest in terms of our collective primal  requirements.For men, this boils down to violence, competition, and  proving themselves physically. The violence, however repugnant it may seem,  takes place in an intensely ritualized format that offers something to all  of its participants. Anyone who thinks that this is hokey and unrealistic  should go to a boxing gym or martial arts training hall. Most of the  participants in such places are not psychotic Neanderthals, but sensitive,  well-behaved yuppies of both genders. Many of the fight scenes in ""Fight  Club"" reminded me of these places not because of the violence but because  of the competition and camaraderie one finds there.""Fight Club"" argues that people have reached  the apogee of this trade off-that they have given up too much freedom to  obtain a diluted and highly regulated form of happiness. The logical  conclusion of  ""Fight Club"" is that people will only be able to lead an  honest and fulfilling life when the instruments of late mature capitalism  are destroyed. Thus the film ends with the bloodied, wounded protagonist  and his girl friend watching the destruction of leading banks and credit  card companies and the dawn of a new era.Understandably, some people  object to the overly masculine nature of the film and its apparent  exclusion of women. My own understanding is that the film focuses on men's  response to contemporary society but is not meant to deny the role of women  in any fashion. It has received accolades from a leading feminist, Susan  Faludi (author of ""Back Lash"") which hopefully confirms this point. If  violence bothers you then definitely do not watch this film.

It takes you right inside a brain, synapses firing, fear response triggered. Really cool music. You know it is CGI, but it looks like you are right inside the old grey matter. It looks like they spent a lot of money, and they did. The opening sequence was budgeted separately from the rest of the film. If they liked what they saw, then they would spring for the sequence the way that director David Fincher wanted it. They came, they saw, they liked, they sprang.Fight Club, the film, is the story of a book by Chuck Palahniuk that would seem an unlikely source for a film. It wasn't as if he wrote it with the idea of selling the film rights, but certain people with rare vision could see it had potential. What were the sources of the ideas for the book?Author Chuck Palahniuk first came up with the idea for Fight Club after being attacked on a camping trip when he had the temerity to complain to some unhappy campers about their noisy radio. When he returned to work he found that nobody would acknowledge his injuries, instead saying such banal things as ""How was your weekend?"" Palahniuk concluded that people reacted this way because if they asked him what had happened, a degree of personal interaction would be necessary, and his workmates simply didn't care enough to get involved, or were afraid of someone who spent their weekends getting into fist fights. It was his fascination with this societal 'blocking' which became the foundation for the novel.He chose the name Tyler Durden after the character of Toby Tyler in Toby Tyler, or Ten Weeks with a Circus (1960), a book that was also made into a Disney movie, and a man called Durden with whom Palahniuk worked, who was fired for sexual harassment. Marla Singer was named after a girl who used to bully Palahniuk's sister in school.Much of the specific content of the novel (such as splicing single frames of pornography into family films, attending support groups for the terminally ill, erasing video tapes, etc.) came from stories told him by friends, and from things his friends actually did. Whilst writing the novel, Palahniuk also interviewed numerous young white males in white-collar jobs, discovering that ""the longing for fathers was a theme I heard a lot about. The resentment of lifestyle standards imposed by advertising was another."" So, in a nut shell, the themes of Fight Club are the longing for a father figure, and anti-consumerism.With the cult status of Fight Club, has the film itself become just another consumer product?----------------Narrator: When deep space exploration ramps up, it'll be the corporations that name everything, the IBM Stellar Sphere, the Microsoft Galaxy, Planet Starbucks.===========Director David Fincher said in an interview in UK film magazine Empire, that there is a Starbucks coffee cup visible in every shot in the movie. Starbucks didn't mind this rampant product placement, but drew the line at a scene where a 'corporate coffee bar' was destroyed along with some corporate art as part of Project Mayhem. Starbucks pulled their name from the scene and the gold globe sculpture crashes into a shop named Gratifico Coffee.----------Tyler Durden: If you could fight anyone, who would you fight?Narrator: Shatner. I'd fight William Shatner.========Chuck Palahniuk told the producers from the very start that, although he fully supported the adaptation, he wasn't interested in writing the screenplay himself. Initially, producer Laura Ziskin considered hiring Buck Henry to adapt the novel, due to the many thematic similarities between Fight Club and The Graduate (1967). I don't really see the similarities. However, Jim Uhls was chosen as the writer instead of Buck Henry. Cameron Crowe (Almost Famous, Vanilla Sky), Andrew Kevin Walker, director David Fincher and actors Brad Pitt and Edward Norton also did uncredited work on the screenplay. Pitt and Norton improvised some dialogue, and added other little touches. At one point, when the Narrator, played by Norton, knocks on the door to complain that Tyler and Marla are making too much noise Pitt answers wearing a yellow rubber glove, and asks him if he wants to join them. The studio wanted to cut this, but it got big laughs at test screenings. Brad Pitt also provided much of his own wardrobe.--------Narrator: Tyler's not here. Tyler went away. Tyler's gone.======Fox 2000 Pictures executive Raymond Bongiovanni, who died shortly before the project was green-lit, first discovered the book whilst still in galleys. Prior to his death, Bongiovanni worked tirelessly to get the project off the ground, and in his obituary, it said that his last wish was that the novel be made into a film. It was Raymond Bongiovanni who sent it to Laura Ziskin, President of Production at Fox 2000 Pictures. She felt it was a tremendous piece of literature, but not necessarily a great movie. The book was sent to a studio reader to evaluate its potential as a possible film, and the report sent back to Ziskin dissed the novel, saying it could never be made into a film, that it was ""exceedingly disturbing"", ""volatile and dangerous"", and would ""make audiences squirm"". Somehow, the bad report made certain people all the more determined to do the film, convinced that they had a hold of some really provocative material.-------------The movie's line ""The first rule of Fight Club is you do not talk about Fight Club"" was #27 of ""The 100 Greatest Movie Lines"" by Premiere in 2007.==========This film was made prior to the events of September 11, 2001, and one wonders if it could have even been made afterwards. One event that did occur after filming that dramatically changed the way test audiences reacted was the Columbine School shootings. The scene where the narrator threatens his boss got laughs at test screenings, but afterwards, was not so funny. Though the film did gather quite a cult following, I don't think that it inspired anyone to do anything--to copy cat Tyler Durden. No one started any Fight Clubs that I know of, unless they followed the first and second rules of Fight Club and didn't talk about it. No Project Mayhems were inspired by Fight Club to my knowledge.-----------Tyler Durden: We're the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War's a spiritual war... our Great Depression is our lives. We've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won't. And we're slowly learning that fact.========Edward Norton was an inspired casting choice. He had gained a lot of weight to play  skin head in American History X, but he lost it for Fight Club to play the more cerebral narrator. The novel Fight Club is largely an interior monologue taking place inside the narrator's head, and voice over can sometimes not go over so well in a film, where you want to show rather than tell. Here though, it worked perfectly, due to Norton's dry delivery.---------Narrator: I am Jack's cold sweat.========Brad Pitt was also an inspired casting choice as Tyler Durden. As I've said, he provided his own costumes from his personal wardrobe. The clothes that Tyler Durden wears are flashy, tacky--perfect for someone who would answer the door wearing a yellow rubber glove. He really understands Tyler Durden and delivers with gusto. I think that Fight Club is some of his best work. He was kind of out there in 12 Monkeys, but that movie wasn't firing on all pistons like Fight Club. His 12 Monkeys was kind of a gallant attempt that failed. Snatch? Give me a break. He approached Fight Club level as the killer Early Grayce in Kalifornia, but Tyler is such a rich and complex character that it leaves all of his other roles in the dust.--------Tyler Durden: I want you to hit me as hard as you can.======Helena Bonham Carter makes a great Marla Singer. At times you almost wonder if she is an imaginary character, a figment of the narrator's fervent imagination.------------Narrator: Marla's philosophy of life is that she might die at any moment. The tragedy, she said, was that she didn't.==========Helena Bonham Carter is a very interesting actress who deserves her parts, even if she does sometimes sleep with the director to get a part (she is married to Tim Burton who cast her as The Red Queen in Alice in Wonderland). She was perfect as Marla Singer.-------------------Marla Singer: There are things about you that I like. You're smart, you're funny, you're... spectacular in bed... But you're intolerable! You have very serious emotional problems. Deep seated problems for which you should seek professional help.Narrator: I know, and I'm sorry...Marla Singer: Yeah, you're sorry, I'm sorry, everybody's sorry, but... I can't do this anymore. I can't. And I won't. I'm gone.=================Meat Loaf and Jared Leto were my favorites among the rest of the cast. They are both also very talented musically, but have a lot of stage presence in films. Leto was Angelface, the blonde space monkey who gets pulverized by the narrator in a Fight Club bout, his pretty face nearly destroyed. Meatloaf was Bob, whose reaction to testicular cancer chemo therapy was to grow enormous breasts.-------------Repeated phrase: His name is Robert Paulsen.============On the Friday that the film was released theatrically in the U.S., Rosie O'Donnell appeared on her TV show and said that she'd seen the film and had been unable to sleep ever since. She then proceeded to give away the twist ending of the film and urged all of her viewers to avoid the movie like the plague. Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and David Fincher discuss this incident on their DVD commentary track, with Pitt calling O'Donnell's actions ""unforgivable"". I remember when Rosie was on The View and she was ecstatic that Britney Spears had finally broken up with K. Fed. She celebrated with confetti and streamers, as if she thought that Britney was now going to forsake all men and join her team. As Britney's behavior grew increasingly erratic, this seemed more and more ill advised. When K. Fed was later awarded custody of their children, we all breathed a sigh of relief. I even took Donald Trump's side in their stupid feud, and even more astonishingly, also sided with Hasslebeck! When Rosie was kicked off The View and replaced with Whoopie, I celebrated with a little confetti and streamers of my own. Oh, Rosie, dear, just kidding, but sometimes you can be so nutty. How is that crush on Tom Cruise going?----------------Narrator: How embarrassing... a house full of condiments and no food.==============The Bottom Line is that Fight Club was ""exceedingly disturbing"", ""volatile and dangerous"", and would ""make audiences squirm"". And it is funny. It is also a masterpiece of film making, and even the author, Chuck Palahniuk, thinks that the film version actually improved on the novel. The director, David Fincher, really took the somewhat fragmented ideas in the text and fashioned out of the shards a bold cinematic vision. The cast, mainly Norton, Pitt, and Bonham Carter, backed him to the hilt, and the result is sublime. The film ended up costing about 67 million, and may not have earned back nearly that amount, but in terms of artistic value, it was worth every penny.------------Narrator: It's called a changeover. The movie goes on, and nobody in the audience has any idea.========Chokeby Chuck PalahniukAlice in Wonderland(2010) Helena Bonham Carter was Red QueenThe Curious Case of Benjamin Button (Two-Disc Special Edition) - Criterion Collection(2008) Directed by David Fincher; Brad Pitt was Benjamin ButtonRequiem for a Dream (Director's Cut)(2000) Jared Leto was Harry GoldfarbBlack & White(1999) Jared Leto was CaseyAmerican History X(1998) Edward Norton was Derek VinyardSeven (Widescreen)(1995) Directed by David Fincher; Brad Pitt was Detective David MillsKalifornia(1993) Brad Pitt was Early GrayceRoadie(1980) Meat Loaf was Travis W.

518613,A34JGR3LMV1I64,B00003CWQ2,ceffalo,"[3, 4]","This film is both underrated and overrated.  It's underrated because I don't think major critics have always given this one a great recommendation, as it deserves such.  I've discovered that, in most cases, if Brad Pitt is in a film then it is probably a good movie.  This one is in many ways.  However, I must also say that it is fully overrated in that those who really champion this film give it a lot more credit than it actually deserves, probably because of how ""cool"" the story goes with them.There are quite a few fight scenes and they are genuinely authentic fighting scenes.  As such, I don't think someone under 18 years of age should watch this movie.The actual content of the film, however, could not be more well developed.  If you've seen 12 Monkeys then I must tell you that some of the idea in this film is very similar to that one, and while I don't think this movie is as intelligent as that, it is indeed a well designed idea altogether.One thing is certain.  If you have no idea what this film is about I can tell you that figuring out what is actually going on is not very easy.  A truly detached movie watcher can probably figure it out and yet still be fully entertained by it.  If you get sunk into the movie, though, you will be well into it before you understand what's happening, and the epiphany delivered is absolutely the tops.  A genuine work of art.Don't be deceived by the title to this film.

518616,A1ASCECH3KOZ3P,B00003CWQ2,C. Gardner,"[0, 0]","""Fight Club"" is a great film that not only satirizes self-help movement, but takes on the myth of our ""alienation"" that spawned it. Apart from the direction, acting, and technical achievement of the film, all of which are first-rate, the most fascinating thing about this work is the convoluted & self-referential story which plays out between the Narrator (Edward Norton), his world, the film, and our reality as viewers (it's a better and far more interesting illustration of paradox than ""Adaptation"", and a textbook example of the concept of irony).The Narrator's story opens with a person named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) about to kill him. The Narrator ""backs up"" and tries to tell the audience how this came about. He began attending 12-step and support groups to feel something--anything--in his numb existence...Thus he thought he could care, creating an illusory world where he ""has a heart"" but yet at the same time can feel superior to these unfortunate people. His fantasy is interrupted by the entrance of another ""tourist"" with the same agenda--Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter). She challenges his little fantasy. He gets angry and retreats back into his insomniac nights, endless television, and Ikea catalogs.Then he meets Tyler, a pseudo-Niezschean malcontent soap-salesman who's fed up with modern existence. Their alienation and loneliness leads these two men to create--well, let's just call it a men's self-help group which Tyler claims gets them back to basics. The Narrator falls for this all the way. His consciousness is split--he knows there's truth to what Tyler is selling him, but also knows that he's taking part in promulgating a tired old lie: the myth that their primal selves has been narcotized by office life & materialism & consumerism. Their solution to this myth--the Fight Club--burgeons across the nation, sprouting ""unauthorized"" fight clubs. Tyler takes control like a fascist leader, manipulating the sheep created by the very society he despises. The Narrator knows that Tyler in fact needs this consumerist society, to be the iconoclast he is...Tyler replies by creating something called Operation Mayhem, a terrorist operation which will prove to the Narrator that Tyler means to destroy this society at its source: the credit institutions which make it possible for people to cover their essential nothingness by buying endless material goods. Tyler tries to break him out of his denial to make him go ""all the way."" Then a twist happens...A strange twist which renders everything seen so far doubly ironic. I don't want to give it away, but it should inspire lots of conversation about the concept of the self, the modern cliches of ""man's alienation"" and redemption from materialism.What a great & classic film.

But Jack is not normal. Far from it. Jack is a chronic insomniac. In his own words: 'Everything is a copy of a copy of a copy.' (Just one of the many brilliant quotes from this movie). To cure his insomnia, Jack joins support groups - for anything. Be it testicular cancer patients who've lost their privates or leukoma patients who just want to be laid one more time before they die, Jack goes to them all. And strangely, finds that this gives him blessed sleep at night. That is, until Marlo shows up - a ... who fakes disease to join these groups. Jack is back to being an insomniac again until he meets Tyler, a soap salesman, who blows up Jack's apartment (but you'll only figure that out later).

What's more, unlike a lot of films (Jurassic Park for example) the film version follows the book quite closely. It would be easy to pass off Fight Club as another violent male aggression film like Die Hard, but this is so much  more. It explores philosophies on life and has a deep and intricate plot.If you like dark grim violent films, then you cannot go wrong with this. But this isn't mindless or even gratuitous. It has a superb storyline (which I won't ruin) but the jist of it is exploring both sides to someone's personality. The film is also very well scripted, with extra bits that the book didn't have. It changes here and there, and sometimes scenes have been twisted. But this is a true and justifiable interpretation of the novel.Another great thing about this is the acting. Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter are all supurb. Carter prooves that being attractive doesn't mean you are automatically an airhead..., and although Pitt is the sort of bloke that other blokes love to hate (why are you punishing me God?!) the truth is that he is a very good acter, not just some guy with a cute ass who has wormed his way into your sister's heart. Lastly, there is Edward Norton. Pitt has the famous name which is perhaps why he is portrayed as the lead character (its kind of a cross between him and Norton really) but Norton is the narrater and he plays his part best in my opinion. But all three of them are fantastic.The only pitfall is that the conclusion is not very well explained as it was in the book, but this does leave the viewer asking questions which is a good thing.All in all this has everything - a great storyline plus great acting, directing and soundtrack to drive it through.

The first half is the film is sharp black humor as Jack and Marla begin their bizarre courtship.Slowly Jack's macho alter ego Tyler begins eclipsing his gentle cooperative persona to the point where, under Tyler's influence, he burns his well-appointed IKEA-packed urban condo and moves to the seedy edge of town near a malodorous paper mill.  Tyler and Jack, in buddy movie fashion, are first depicted as like-minded friends, both on the run from capitalistic values and their commodifying effect on human beings as well as a male-bashing Ritalin-crazed post-feminist world.  In their large dilapidated shabby-chic home, they create a male precinct where the traditional masculine values of freedom, mischief, rebellion, and vitality can thrive.In a touching scene, Tyler and Jack discuss the absence of fathers, hinting that this missing piece of their upbringing is behind their vague but tender homoeroticism.  In their spare time, the duo form FIGHT CLUB, a group of disaffected men who meet in the basements of bars for bare knuckles boxing sessions which those involved find cathartic and invigorating.In the Bible Christ says:  ""I came not to bring peace but a sword.""  Tyler Durden can be seen as a Christ figure.  As a 30something, he's the right age.  He gathers an enthused discipleship.  He preaches of a spiritual war against materialism and docility.  Instead of the Sermon on the Mount, we get The Sermon in the Basement.  Tyler takes on the powers that be in his society, much as Christ did, with an army of misfits and outsiders, and he proves he is willing to die for his cause.""Fight Club"" flies in the face of political correctness every chance it gets and reminds us how sex and aggression animate our lives.  The scene in which Tyler gives Jack a searing chemical burn on the back of his hand is the film's shuddering climax.  Jack tries to disappear into New Age fantasy as Tyler urges him to stay with the pain.  This is Jack's hazing into manhood, recalling the male rites of passage of primitive tribes.  It reflects Christian mythos as well, since the scar from Jack's burn resembles one of Christ's stigmata.  Jack and Tyler then proceed to give this scar to all new Fight Club members.When Fight Club morphs into ""Operation Mayhem,"" Tyler's vandalistic direct attack on civilization, Jack becomes skittish and winds up out of the information loop of an organization he helped to create.  He and Tyler clash, which yields a shocking revelation about them I won't spoil here.""Fight Club"" and ""American Beauty"" (both 1999) rail against the domesticated demise of American frontier manhood.  Their central characters are willing to pay a high price for freedom.  These characters' failures and disconnections lead to a kind of endearing macho campiness, and many will be lead to sympathize with their ""male malaise.""""Fight Club"" is like a gun aimed at the idealized androgyny and co-ed conversion of the last 40 years.  What men need, it seems to claim, is ""guy-space"" and ""guy-time,"" male bonding and man-making ritual.  The movie suggests that only after this confidence and swagger is achieved can a man be a fit companion for a woman, meeting her considerable sexual and emotional power with a brand of power all his own.Well acted by Pitt, Norton, and Carter; ably directed with great technical flourish by David Fincher; poetically written by novelist Chuck Palahniuk and screenwriter Jim Uhls, ""Fight Club"" is a biting satire, a malcontented masterpiece that forecasts a redefinition of manhood which is somehow both revolutionary and reactionary.  After Americans are past the long period of political centrism that began in the late 1980s and persists tothis day, look for ""Fight Club"" to be regarded as a crystal ball.",5,The Men's Movement on Celluloid,1054512000,"06 2, 2003",2003,4599,"['1999', 'decade', 'bookish', 'Men', 'Movement', 'concerns', 'have', 'finally', 'been', 'committed', 'celluloid', 'Fight', 'Club', 'Tyler', 'Durden', 'cocky', 'virile', 'manhood', 'missing', 'pale', 'fluorescence', 'modern', 'man', 'office', 'life', 'service', 'economy.Brad', 'Pitt', 'Tyler', 'chainsmokes', 'wears', 'red', 'leather', 'garishly', 'behaves', 'transgressively', 'paramilitary', 'movement', 'overthrow', 'glaze', 'American', 'corporate', 'world', 'placed', 'eyes', 'drone', 'workers.We', 'begin', 'however', 'Ed', 'Norton', 'emasculated', 'Jack', 'insurance', 'appraiser', 'unchanneled', 'emotion', 'made', 'sag-eyed', 'insomniac', 'Physically', 'healthy', 'Jack', 'illness', 'support', 'groups', 'means', 'vent', 'sadness', 'frustration', 'there', 'sassy', 'basketcase', 'Marla', 'Singer', 'Helena', 'Bonhma', 'Carter', 'whom', 'too', 'much', 'eunuch', 'seduce', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'sharp', 'black', 'humor', 'Jack', 'Marla', 'begin', 'bizarre', 'courtship.Slowly', 'Jack', 'macho', 'alter', 'ego', 'Tyler', 'eclipsing', 'gentle', 'cooperative', 'persona', 'point', 'where', 'Tyler', 'influence', 'well-appointed', 'IKEA-packed', 'urban', 'condo', 'moves', 'seedy', 'edge', 'town', 'malodorous', 'paper', 'mill', 'Tyler', 'Jack', 'buddy', 'movie', 'fashion', 'are', 'first', 'depicted', 'like-minded', 'friends', 'run', 'capitalistic', 'values', 'commodifying', 'effect', 'human', 'beings', 'as', 'well', 'male-bashing', 'Ritalin-crazed', 'post-feminist', 'world', 'large', 'dilapidated', 'shabby-chic', 'home', 'create', 'male', 'precinct', 'where', 'traditional', 'masculine', 'values', 'freedom', 'mischief', 'rebellion', 'vitality', 'can', 'thrive.In', 'touching', 'scene', 'Tyler', 'Jack', 'discuss', 'absence', 'fathers', 'hinting', 'missing', 'piece', 'upbringing', 'vague', 'tender', 'homoeroticism', 'spare', 'time', 'duo', 'form', 'FIGHT', 'CLUB', 'group', 'disaffected', 'men', 'who', 'meet', 'basements', 'bars', 'bare', 'knuckles', 'boxing', 'sessions', 'involved', 'find', 'cathartic', 'invigorating.In', 'Bible', 'Christ', 'came', 'not', 'bring', 'peace', 'sword', 'Tyler', 'Durden', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'Christ', 'figure', '30something', 'right', 'age', 'enthused', 'discipleship', 'spiritual', 'war', 'materialism', 'docility', 'Instead', 'Sermon', 'Mount', 'get', 'Sermon', 'Basement', 'Tyler', 'powers', 'be', 'society', 'much', 'Christ', 'did', 'army', 'misfits', 'outsiders', 'willing', 'die', 'cause', 'Fight', 'Club', 'flies', 'face', 'political', 'correctness', 'chance', 'how', 'sex', 'aggression', 'animate', 'lives', 'scene', 'Tyler', 'Jack', 'searing', 'chemical', 'burn', 'back', 'hand', 'film', 'shuddering', 'climax', 'Jack', 'disappear', 'New', 'Age', 'fantasy', 'Tyler', 'stay', 'pain', 'Jack', 'hazing', 'manhood', 'recalling', 'male', 'rites', 'passage', 'primitive', 'tribes', 'Christian', 'mythos', 'as', 'well', 'scar', 'Jack', 'burn', 'one', 'Christ', 'stigmata', 'Jack', 'Tyler', 'then', 'proceed', 'give', 'scar', 'new', 'Fight', 'Club', 'members.When', 'Fight', 'Club', 'Operation', 'Mayhem', 'Tyler', 'vandalistic', 'direct', 'attack', 'civilization', 'Jack', 'skittish', 'up', 'information', 'loop', 'organization', 'helped', 'create', 'Tyler', 'clash', 'shocking', 'revelation', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'here', 'Fight', 'Club', 'American', 'Beauty', '1999', 'rail', 'domesticated', 'demise', 'American', 'frontier', 'manhood', 'central', 'characters', 'are', 'willing', 'pay', 'high', 'price', 'freedom', 'characters', 'failures', 'disconnections', 'lead', 'kind', 'endearing', 'macho', 'campiness', 'many', 'will', 'be', 'lead', 'sympathize', 'male', 'malaise', 'Fight', 'Club', 'gun', 'aimed', 'idealized', 'androgyny', 'co-ed', 'conversion', 'last', '40', 'years', 'What', 'men', 'need', 'claim', 'guy-space', 'guy-time', 'male', 'bonding', 'man-making', 'ritual', 'movie', 'only', 'confidence', 'swagger', 'achieved', 'can', 'man', 'be', 'fit', 'companion', 'woman', 'meeting', 'considerable', 'sexual', 'emotional', 'power', 'brand', 'power', 'own.Well', 'acted', 'Pitt', 'Norton', 'Carter', 'ably', 'directed', 'great', 'technical', 'flourish', 'David', 'Fincher', 'poetically', 'written', 'novelist', 'Chuck', 'Palahniuk', 'screenwriter', 'Jim', 'Uhls', 'Fight', 'Club', 'biting', 'satire', 'malcontented', 'masterpiece', 'redefinition', 'manhood', 'somehow', 'revolutionary', 'reactionary', 'Americans', 'are', 'long', 'period', 'political', 'centrism', 'began', 'late', '1980s', 'persists', 'tothis', 'day', 'look', 'Fight', 'Club', 'be', 'regarded', 'crystal', 'ball']",N/A

518635,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B00003CWQ2,"Cloud ""...""","[1, 3]","Based on a book by Chuck Pahlinier(or something, didn't check spelling), Fight Club is basically a movie that has a central plot but also tries to tell the audience a little something about life, a lesson or moral if you will. There are certain moments in the film you may not understand or it's too pretentious but you'll just keep watching, even if you hate the thing.The Narrator(his name is not Jack or Rupert; Jack was from a book of health definitions e.g ""I am Jack's medulla oblongata"" and it isn't Rupert as that was one of his fake names) lives a very meaningless life. He works in a job he hates to buy new sofas and furniture that ""defines him as a person"". He also has a really bad case of insomnia. He finds support groups with a certain theme like cancer groups or any other kind of disease group and people dealing with it. He ends up find a weird peace where he's able to cry and actually even sleep.Until she walks in. Marla is also a ""tourist"" who just goes to the groups for entertainment and free coffee. His life goes back to normal with the insomnia until his condo blows up. Well good thing he met Tyler Durden, a soap maker and worked on film reels splicing porn shots into children's films for only a few frames.  Together they start Fight Club, where men can go and get out their aggression with life by beating the **** out of each other. Only Marla has a relationship with Tyler and the Narrator starts something that he can't stop or control.To be honest, I kind of hate preachers or self help gurus that tell you to take charge of your life and seize the day etc cause most of us don't want to ""take charge"", our lives while difficult at times, are what we make of it and we wouldn't have it any other way. The film almost takes a anarchistic view of things by telling you you're not your job, quit it if you want, meet new people and basically live life. Only thing is our job we hate ends up paying for the roof over our heads, the food in our guts, the clothes we wear and our children's toys and clothes and other assorted stuff. As much as we hate consumerism and the idea that buying more useless stuff is good, part of our lives can't function without it, which the film doesn't address as much.It's also quite interesting looking at Brad Pitt's performance as Tyler. He is capable of doing some good films, he just sometimes picks the wrong ones. In this film he kind of plays that friend you always despised in high school that grew up to be a smartass: he has answers for the questions you never ask and comes off as a know-it-all. He's quite pompous and a bit pretentious but it works. Edward Norton gives also a good performance as almost mouse-like and slightly awkward(I still find it funny that to ""threaten the cops"", he uses the term 'lead salad'.) Helena Bonham Carter(who recently had a child with Batman director Tim Burton FYI) is quite a standout as that weird girl who chain smokes, has weird morbid thoughts and has that bad girl image down.And it's about time David Fincher starting working with effects because they're quite good. They don't overwhelm the story(I'm looking at you George Lucas) but merely enhance it.The film is quite good to watch although half the time you might not make sense of it all or criticize certain things. It's not for everyone, true. I guess if Tyler Durden were to write a review on a film based on changing your life, he'd say ""why watch the film? Just go outside and change your life yourself?"". It sounds nice but most of us will just watch our good movie.",5,"You'll probablylove what you see but won't ""get it""",1110758400,"03 14, 2005",2005,3548,"['Based', 'book', 'Chuck', 'Pahlinier', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'check', 'spelling', 'Fight', 'Club', 'basically', 'movie', 'central', 'plot', 'also', 'tell', 'audience', 'little', 'something', 'life', 'lesson', 'moral', 'will', 'are', 'certain', 'moments', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'understand', 'too', 'pretentious', ""'ll"", 'just', 'keep', 'watching', 'even', 'hate', 'thing.The', 'Narrator', 'name', 'not', 'Jack', 'Rupert', 'Jack', 'was', 'book', 'health', 'definitions', 'e.g', 'am', 'Jack', 'medulla', 'oblongata', ""n't"", 'Rupert', 'was', 'one', 'fake', 'names', 'very', 'meaningless', 'life', 'job', 'buy', 'new', 'sofas', 'furniture', 'defines', 'person', 'also', 'really', 'bad', 'case', 'insomnia', 'support', 'groups', 'certain', 'theme', 'cancer', 'groups', 'other', 'kind', 'disease', 'group', 'people', 'dealing', 'up', 'find', 'weird', 'peace', 'where', 'able', 'cry', 'actually', 'even', 'sleep.Until', 'walks', 'Marla', 'also', 'tourist', 'who', 'just', 'groups', 'entertainment', 'free', 'coffee', 'life', 'back', 'normal', 'insomnia', 'condo', 'up', 'Well', 'good', 'thing', 'met', 'Tyler', 'Durden', 'soap', 'maker', 'worked', 'film', 'reels', 'splicing', 'porn', 'shots', 'children', 'films', 'only', 'few', 'frames', 'Together', 'start', 'Fight', 'Club', 'where', 'men', 'can', 'go', 'get', 'out', 'aggression', 'life', 'beating', '****', 'other', 'Only', 'Marla', 'relationship', 'Tyler', 'Narrator', 'something', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'control.To', 'be', 'honest', 'kind', 'hate', 'preachers', 'help', 'gurus', 'tell', 'take', 'charge', 'life', 'seize', 'day', 'etc', 'cause', 'most', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'take', 'charge', 'lives', 'difficult', 'times', 'are', 'what', 'make', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'other', 'way', 'film', 'almost', 'anarchistic', 'view', 'things', 'telling', ""'re"", 'not', 'job', 'quit', 'want', 'meet', 'new', 'people', 'basically', 'live', 'life', 'Only', 'thing', 'job', 'hate', 'up', 'paying', 'roof', 'heads', 'food', 'guts', 'clothes', 'wear', 'children', 'toys', 'clothes', 'other', 'assorted', 'stuff', 'As', 'much', 'hate', 'consumerism', 'idea', 'buying', 'more', 'useless', 'stuff', 'good', 'part', 'lives', 'ca', ""n't"", 'function', 'film', ""n't"", 'address', 'much.It', 'also', 'quite', 'interesting', 'looking', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'performance', 'Tyler', 'capable', 'doing', 'good', 'films', 'just', 'sometimes', 'wrong', 'ones', 'film', 'kind', 'plays', 'friend', 'always', 'despised', 'high', 'school', 'grew', 'up', 'be', 'smartass', 'answers', 'questions', 'never', 'ask', 'off', 'know-it-all', 'quite', 'pompous', 'bit', 'pretentious', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'also', 'good', 'performance', 'almost', 'mouse-like', 'slightly', 'still', 'find', 'threaten', 'cops', 'term', 'salad', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'who', 'recently', 'had', 'child', 'Batman', 'director', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'FYI', 'quite', 'standout', 'weird', 'girl', 'who', 'chain', 'smokes', 'weird', 'morbid', 'thoughts', 'bad', 'girl', 'image', 'down.And', 'time', 'David', 'Fincher', 'starting', 'working', 'effects', ""'re"", 'quite', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'overwhelm', 'story', ""'m"", 'looking', 'George', 'Lucas', 'merely', 'enhance', 'it.The', 'film', 'quite', 'good', 'watch', 'time', 'might', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'criticize', 'certain', 'things', 'not', 'everyone', 'true', 'guess', 'Tyler', 'Durden', 'were', 'write', 'review', 'film', 'based', 'changing', 'life', ""'d"", 'say', 'why', 'watch', 'film', 'Just', 'go', 'outside', 'change', 'life', 'nice', 'most', 'will', 'just', 'watch', 'good', 'movie']",N/A

You know who you are.)I was sadly disappointed.The usually magnificent Edward Norton is wasted here. Helena Bonham Carter shows range in a role that is the antithesis of her earlier career, and also that she can handle an American accent. Brad Pitt is merely a showpiece to spout pseudophilosophies based on freedom through testosterone flow.In fact, the whole movie is like that, and near the end, it completely loses control of itself. The ""discovery"" at the end was not earth-shattering or particularly surprising, given the clues throughout. It seemed to me simply a contrivance, trying to be something that changes your outlook on the film a la Keyser Soze in The Usual Suspects.Unfortunately, by that time, I was already bored.And unlike my friends, I was not impressed by the revelation of ""cigarette burns,"" (spots in the upper right corner of a film that tell the projectionist when to change reels) as I had worked in A/V in college and knew about them already.

518646,A2VB13MDBBC62M,B00003CWQ2,"""cwlova""","[5, 9]","Fight Club is about a man, known only as the Narrator, (Edward Norton) who hates his boring life and has to find alternative ways to deal with his misery.  One of the ways he copes is by becoming a tourist, but not in a traditional sense.  This kind of tourist is someone who attends support groups even though he/she doesn't have any disease or affliction.  He goes to support group meetings because he likes the coffee, the folded chairs, the crying, the sharing of feelings.  He likes feeling special for once.  The whole premise of this type of &quot;tourism&quot; has black humor value, but the film's handling of these scenes (especially the deadly unfunny topic of cancer) is more dumb than funny or really black for that matter.While at a support group, he meets Marla (Helena Bonham Carter), another tourist.  She looks like a heroin addict, wears the blackest make up one can wear without looking Goth, and dresses in clothes that were &quot;once owned by the victim of a sex crime.&quot;  Marla hates life like the Narrator, but copes with it by becoming suicidal and self- destructive, unlike the Narrator who becomes violent- a pretty clear statement about male and female aggression.  While women take it out on themselves, men take it out on each other.  But that's pretty much all one can say to describe Marla.  She has no ambition, no motivation, and she doesn't really do anything.  Marla is truly a nothing character, despite Helena Bonham Carter's fascinating performance.  Her purpose is solely to gratuitously have sex and round out the edges of the plot.After his apartment mysteriously burns down, the Narrator decides to call a soap salesman he met on a plane named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt).  He finds that Tyler is everything that he wants to be but can't.  Tyler is muscular and good looking in a rugged way as opposed to Edward Norton's sniveling dweeb.  Tyler works at his own pace; the Narrator sees himself as a white-collar slave.  Tyler lives in a dilapidated house, an utter contrast to the Narrator's former IKEA shrine.  Tyler is everything anti-consumerism, anti- greed, anti-conformity.  After their first meeting, Tyler says something to the Narrator thatsurprises him.  &quot;Hit me&quot; he says.  The two then get into a fight, find the experience exhilarating, and start a literal &quot;fight club&quot; in the basement of Tyler's dilapidated house.  Soon, scores of men across the unnamed city they live in start showing up to beat each other up.The basic message I got from this film is that when men feel they aren't allowed to work out their aggressions, they become violent and insane.  The target in this film is consumerism and conformity in the work place, which threaten a man's masculinity.  Consumerism, according to Tyler, is the artificial hunter-gatherer sense of worth, and thus picks apart the biological foundation which gives worth to the male mind.  To compensate for this confusion and subsequent loss of masculinity, these men need to beat each other up and get beaten up to feel the rugged pain that they've been denied their lives.A question I found myself repeatedly asking was, could someone actually &quot;enjoy&quot; breaking their nose, punching their teeth out, and getting stitches?  The purpose is to show the EXTREMES of male frustration, but it would have been better had David Fincher had actually made the violence glamorous.  As it stands, the violence is graphic enough to be unwatchable, but also too unrealistic to take seriously (no one can kick and punch someone in the jaw repeatedly without breaking it in some way).  Or maybe, just maybe, Fincher didn't have to show the violence at all.  How brilliant would a movie with the main theme of violence be if it didn't have a lot of actual violence in it?  Also if violence and mayhem is a common goal among men, how come most war veterans find themselves in trauma and shock at the evils of their own violence?  And why don't these men enroll inthe army if they enjoy pointless violence so much?  Though any movie that generates heavy discussion, is, by default, interesting, most of the questions Fight Club conjures are provoked about the basis of why the movie was made to explore these themes, not about the actual content itself.  Thus it doesn't constitute as sufficient ambiguity.Finally, the twist ending.  Although surprising and cool, not that much of interest happens before then.  However, the twist is so cool in fact, that I was almost tempted to forget how much I didn't enjoy the movie up to that point.  Consider it a great ending to a sorely misguided movie.",4,Highly flawed,1008460800,"12 16, 2001",2001,4611,"['Fight', 'Club', 'man', 'known', 'only', 'Narrator', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'who', 'boring', 'life', 'find', 'alternative', 'ways', 'deal', 'misery', 'One', 'ways', 'becoming', 'tourist', 'not', 'traditional', 'sense', 'kind', 'tourist', 'someone', 'who', 'support', 'groups', 'even', 'he/she', ""n't"", 'have', 'disease', 'affliction', 'support', 'group', 'meetings', 'coffee', 'folded', 'chairs', 'crying', 'sharing', 'feelings', 'feeling', 'special', 'once', 'whole', 'premise', 'type', 'quot', 'tourism', 'quot', 'black', 'humor', 'value', 'film', 'handling', 'scenes', 'especially', 'deadly', 'unfunny', 'topic', 'cancer', 'more', 'dumb', 'funny', 'really', 'black', 'matter.While', 'support', 'group', 'Marla', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'tourist', 'heroin', 'addict', 'blackest', 'make', 'up', 'one', 'can', 'wear', 'looking', 'Goth', 'clothes', 'were', 'quot', 'once', 'owned', 'victim', 'sex', 'crime.', 'quot', 'Marla', 'life', 'Narrator', 'becoming', 'suicidal', 'self-', 'destructive', 'Narrator', 'who', 'violent-', 'pretty', 'clear', 'statement', 'male', 'female', 'aggression', 'women', 'take', 'out', 'men', 'take', 'out', 'other', 'pretty', 'much', 'one', 'can', 'say', 'describe', 'Marla', 'ambition', 'motivation', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'anything', 'Marla', 'truly', 'nothing', 'character', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'fascinating', 'performance', 'purpose', 'solely', 'gratuitously', 'have', 'sex', 'round', 'edges', 'plot.After', 'apartment', 'mysteriously', 'down', 'Narrator', 'call', 'soap', 'salesman', 'met', 'plane', 'named', 'Tyler', 'Durden', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Tyler', 'everything', 'be', 'ca', ""n't"", 'Tyler', 'muscular', 'good', 'looking', 'rugged', 'way', 'opposed', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'sniveling', 'dweeb', 'Tyler', 'own', 'pace', 'Narrator', 'white-collar', 'slave', 'Tyler', 'dilapidated', 'house', 'utter', 'contrast', 'Narrator', 'former', 'IKEA', 'shrine', 'Tyler', 'everything', 'anti-consumerism', 'anti-', 'greed', 'anti-conformity', 'first', 'meeting', 'Tyler', 'something', 'Narrator', 'quot', 'Hit', 'quot', 'two', 'then', 'get', 'fight', 'find', 'experience', 'exhilarating', 'start', 'literal', 'quot', 'fight', 'club', 'quot', 'basement', 'Tyler', 'dilapidated', 'house', 'Soon', 'scores', 'men', 'unnamed', 'city', 'live', 'start', 'showing', 'up', 'beat', 'other', 'up.The', 'basic', 'message', 'got', 'film', 'when', 'men', 'feel', 'are', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'work', 'out', 'aggressions', 'become', 'violent', 'insane', 'target', 'film', 'consumerism', 'conformity', 'work', 'place', 'man', 'masculinity', 'Consumerism', 'according', 'Tyler', 'artificial', 'hunter-gatherer', 'sense', 'worth', 'thus', 'picks', 'apart', 'biological', 'foundation', 'worth', 'male', 'mind', 'compensate', 'confusion', 'subsequent', 'loss', 'masculinity', 'men', 'need', 'beat', 'other', 'up', 'get', 'beaten', 'up', 'feel', 'rugged', 'pain', ""'ve"", 'been', 'denied', 'lives.A', 'question', 'found', 'repeatedly', 'asking', 'was', 'could', 'someone', 'actually', 'quot', 'quot', 'breaking', 'nose', 'punching', 'teeth', 'out', 'getting', 'stitches', 'purpose', 'show', 'EXTREMES', 'male', 'frustration', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'had', 'David', 'Fincher', 'had', 'actually', 'made', 'violence', 'glamorous', 'violence', 'graphic', 'enough', 'be', 'unwatchable', 'also', 'too', 'unrealistic', 'take', 'seriously', 'one', 'can', 'kick', 'punch', 'someone', 'jaw', 'repeatedly', 'breaking', 'way', 'maybe', 'just', 'maybe', 'Fincher', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'show', 'violence', 'How', 'brilliant', 'would', 'movie', 'main', 'theme', 'violence', 'be', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'actual', 'violence', 'Also', 'violence', 'mayhem', 'common', 'goal', 'men', 'how', 'come', 'most', 'war', 'veterans', 'find', 'trauma', 'shock', 'evils', 'own', 'violence', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'men', 'enroll', 'inthe', 'army', 'enjoy', 'pointless', 'violence', 'so', 'much', 'movie', 'heavy', 'discussion', 'default', 'interesting', 'most', 'questions', 'Fight', 'Club', 'conjures', 'are', 'provoked', 'basis', 'why', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'explore', 'themes', 'not', 'actual', 'content', 'Thus', ""n't"", 'constitute', 'sufficient', 'ambiguity.Finally', 'twist', 'ending', 'surprising', 'cool', 'not', 'much', 'interest', 'happens', 'then', 'However', 'twist', 'so', 'cool', 'fact', 'was', 'almost', 'tempted', 'forget', 'how', 'much', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'movie', 'up', 'point', 'Consider', 'great', 'ending', 'sorely', 'misguided', 'movie']",N/A

He tries group therapy, which  helps for awhile, until he runs into Tyler (Brad Pitt), and with him,  discovers that beating up and being beaten up restores meaning to his life.  It snowballs from there. I don't want to spoil anything.The screenwriter  may have cobbled together some of Hakim Bey's works on &quot;Poetic  Terrorism&quot; and &quot;Ontological Anarchism&quot; for this one, coupled  with either fascist and/or Bolshevik organizational methods (Fight Club  itself, and the later Operation: Mayhem). Maybe a fusion of them all,  coupled with some conspiracy theory touches here and there.There are a  lot of fun effects throughout this movie, and Brad Pitt and Ed Norton do a  great job, as does Helena Bonham Carter. The comments on the consumer  culture are the most valuable in this one, and it's clear who the writer  thinks the real enemy is - it's not so much about men rediscovering lost  libidos as it is attacking corporate America itself.

518650,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B00003CWQ2,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[0, 0]","This is proabably close to my favorite film I've ever seen.  It's just spendidly done and very well crafted, you just lose yourself in the film from open to close.  It also gets credit for being one of the only films (next to 'mystic river') that follows the novel so well.  I hate watching films that distract from the message of the novel by changing the story line so drastically they should have given it a different name ('Less Than Zero' was one of the worst).  I have to say that if you've never read the novel, you should read it ASAP.  I find that you can find more morality or at least more of a morale to the story when reading printed page versus watching the screen since we tend to get so wrapped up in the glitter and gloss (not much glitter in this film) that we get distracted from the real reason the story was written.  Our story revolves around a nameless narator (played BRILLIANTLY by Norton, another slam dunk for him here), an insomniac who, in order to find peace of mind, spends his time bounceing from group therapy meetings, sharing his fake stories and crying, he does a lot of crying, and all that release makes him, well, sleep...all until he meets Marla (Helena Bonham Carter) who is oddly stunning in this film, mixing well her 'come-hither' good looks with her 'go-away' attitude...she is repulsivly-beautiful if that is possible.  You see Marla, dispite her charm (if you call it that) is just another roadblock in our narators road to peace.  You see, knowing that there is another 'poser' in the same sessions as him, he just can't cry with her watching him and so he can't get that release and without that release he can't sleep and so our narator ends up back where he started...all until he meets Tyler (Pitt, who by the way does AMAZING here...I have to say that although I am always ragging on his 'lack of acting ability' to my wife, referring to him as a B-Grade actor, I still have to admit that he has talant, I just feel that he, like Leo alike, are widely overlooked because of their 'pretty-boy' stereotypes)...anyways...Tyler opens a door for our narator to release the stress that robs him of inner peace, and when his apartment is torched to the ground he has no where to go but to Tyler.

I haven't seen this type of acting by two young people, that people don't like because they thing they're cocky, in all my life. Brad Pitt gives such a convincing performance as the do-anything leader of Fight Club, and Edward norton's character. Now Edward Norton, man, can you picture a better insomniac than him? I thought not. The acting is down right convincing and is helped by the unbelievable screenplay.Plot: An insomniac is fed up with life and doesn't know how to live it. He try's social groups but they make it worse. Then he meets Tyler Durden and the fun begins to rip into your chest like you've never experienced. THey stard Fight Club, a way to get the pressures of life off your back. Then they take it a step further and, well, I shouldn't say more because of the ending. The ending will blow away your mind! It will not make sense at first but then you can see it.With all this said, when I first saw this movie I was a little dissapointed. It was not what I expected. Then I saw it a second time and I was motionless. The hidden secrets in this movie are what caught me in. They are the reason that this movie is beyond your minds capacity. If you think you missed out on something, you did. So just watch it again and you will find it. It has so many interesting and provocative points on life, women, men, society, leaders, brothers, government, movies, homosexuality (this might take some time to figure out), heterosexuality, puberty in your 30's, and the list is endless. If you thought that those are some odd points, wait till you see the movie.This film is dark and always in your face. It doesn't escape from you. it is almost as if you become Edward Norton's character. You begin to feel him and feel his emotions. A note to everyone: Go see this movie with an open mind. Then you will allow yourself to see the modern classic titles Fight Club.I have always been pulled in by dark, controversial, disturbing, funny, and odd images. This movie has all of that in one. One may disagree with me on all of this becuase they missed the message that it was giving out. I can't say the message becuase it will give away the story. Another point is that this plot has so many stories hidden within the obvious that you will HAVE to see it again.You should love this movie's forceful views on society. It shows this through hidden views. Ancient Greek Mythology must be read with the concept that one thing means another and that one thing is hiding behind another. This is what Fight Club is.

My own opinion:  It is an overlong movie.  There is about 20 minutes, where the fascist movement is growing where I  got up, &amp; without hitting pause on the video, nuked a bag of popcorn.  I figure the director put those twenty minutes in there for that  purpose--to encourage popcorn sales.  That seems horrible to say in a movie  that sings the praises of anarchy, but it is quite possibly the truth.  Otherwise Mr. Fincher could have used his talent as a music video director  to create a funny montage sequence in place of that moment of cinematic  redundancy.

All of a sudden, quite recently, 'Fight Club' became rather annoyingly ubiquitous, by chance, and I saw the film everywhere, and everyone was all of a sudden telling me how I needed to see it.I finally saw it, and I am so very glad that I did.I can't give away too much for those who haven't had the pleasure, but it's the story of the sprouting of an underground terrorist group, in the form of secret meetings of 'Fight Clubs' around the country. The first rule of Fight Club is to not talk about Fight Club. The second rule of Fight CLub is to not talk about Fight Club... But when more and more people become acquainted with the group, Norton's 'unnamed' character becomes more and more suspicious of 'friend' Tyler.The Fight Clubs intensify, and eventually evolve into soap selling, explosive creating, doers of mayhem working together to defeat capitalism and the unnecessaries of life. Ironically, their common quest for difference drives the army to becoming more and more the same.The film's ending was unquestioningly impressive. Although one could argue it's cliche-ness, I found it rather inobtrusive, and unpredictable, giving the film very satisfying closure.Overall, I found the performances by Norton, Pitt, and Bonham-Carter to be incredibly sublime, and the cinematography to have a real gritty feel to it.

518657,A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ,B00003CWQ2,"Daniel S. ""Daniel""","[2, 3]","One of the most often repeated critiques made about director David Fincher's FIGHT CLUB is that the movie presents the apology of the violence  and, among other ideas, defends the theory that today general aggressivity  can only be controlled by letting people expressing verbally and physically  this violence. In a way, we could become a new generation of Romans  watching without guilt hyper-brutal movies in the same way than the ancient  Romans were applauding the gladiators. Well, I admit that maybe some  limited persons can feel an intense pleasure while watching the fights of  FIGHT CLUB and what ? If only these scenes could prevent real incidents by  offering to some of us the possibility to let our adrenaline flow freely,  why not !But FIGHT CLUB deserves a lot more than sterile discussions  about this peculiar aspect of the movie. Firstly, director David FINCHER,  along with his art director, has created a unique artistic vision of Edward  Norton's sick point of view. From the beginning of the movie, the story is  told from Norton's point of view which slowly deforms the reality and  presents to the audience a world filled with the obsessions of the  insomniac employee. Fincher, with a few arty effects and very good  monologs, is able to create very quickly uneasiness and tension.With the  apparition of Brad Pitt, the movie, little by little, gives up his critical  and social dimension and becomes the repertoire of our most hidden fears or  desires. When the Fight Club is replaced by the Mayhem Project, you are  thrown into the world that director Don Siegel had so well described in  INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, a world where paranoia is the only  rule.A DVD for your library.

I happen to have read the book and think the film A) doesn't understand the book's point and B) has a rebellious posture but never does anything remotely rebellious.  I know this film has a lot of vociferious defenders, but, frankly, I could care less.  This movie is one of the worst literary adaptations on the planet.Let's start with the actual book itself.  What you have to understand is that the book, despite being only 200 pages, is extremely elaborate; everything, literally everything, any character says or does ties back to something else as you progress.  So if you're adapting the story, you can't just drop parts of the novel and shove new things in.  It won't work.  Which is exactly what David Fincher and Jim Uhls do.Fincher and Uhls just didn't understand the book.  While Fincher goes off on his usual &quot;lookit me, I'm an auteur because I make everything grimy and dark&quot; kick, Uhls, a first-time screenwriter, adapts things to Fincher's over-the-top, idiotic sensibility.  What really bugs me was the COMPLETE rejection of Palahniuk's use of duality; he mocks both materialism and a rejection of materialism so complete you reject yourself in the novel.  Here, Fincher endorses the latter as a good thing.Here's what REALLY gets me; Fincher obviously thinks he's pushing the envelope here, but not once, NOT ONCE, are we confronted with anything we haven't seen before.  He never does more than poke at the surface of disgusting and/or bizarre and says  &quot;See, I'm a rebel!&quot;  He completely lacks the courage to include some of the more intense scenes in the book, instead replacing them with cheap laughs at easy targets.

518661,A1NQF8UIYTYTG7,B00003CWQ2,Dark Trippers,"[40, 49]","Fincher's Fight Club opens in a mysterious semi-darkness, both comforting and disquieting, autistic and boundless, vaguely familiar. But it is only when we are expelled from this strangely biomorphic womb-like place we realise that we have been within the deep recesses of our protagonist's  mind. In a shaky pullback we emerge from Jack's mouth that has the barrel  of a gun jammed inside it.Jack is a loner, a man going nowhere fast, an  angst-ridden emasculated wage-slave with terrible insomnia. He seeks  solace, rather bizarrely, in victim support groups, feeding off the misery  of others Sleep comes to him at last and he becomes addicted to the  self-help ethos. That is, until he is exposed by another fake attendee,  Marla. Without the group empathy and misery-fix to soothe his troubles,  Jack hurtles deeper into depression, culminating in his apartment  exploding. In his deep dark night of the soul he turns to Tyler  Durden.Tyler Durden is the embodiment of pure id: an existential  nihilist, a sociopath with terrorist inclinations, inhabiting a dilapidated  decaying brownstone on the edge of existence. He scavenges human fat from  liposuction clinics to make into soap to sell back to the rich ladies it  came from; urinates in the soup of the restaurant in which he works; and,  moonlighting as a projectionist, he splices single frames of pornography  into family movies. The disruption of the social ethic is his prime  motivation.When the two men get into a fight, Jack is amazed how  exhilarated he is by the raw, unfettered violence. Consequently, the Fight  Club is formed, a secret society of like-minded males prepared to go  one-on-one with bare-knuckles. But, &quot;the first rule of Fight Club is  that you don't talk about Fight Club&quot;, and with the movie it's true  too: here I depart from plot details. But let me say this: Fight Club is  not a fighting picture (Van Damme fans be warned) and it is as far removed  from the escapist blockbuster that people expected as it is possible to get  (hence its box office failure). But, quite simply, Fight Club is, without  doubt, one of the most subversive pieces of cinema, ever. And. With a  denouement twist that is, unlike The Sixth Sense, impossible to  guess.Based on a controversial novel by Chuck Palanhiuk, Fight Club is a  relentlessly dark, tortuous journey of one man's self-discovery. Hoisted up  to greatness by Fincher's incredible vision and by career best performances  from both Norton and Pitt, it is one of those rare films that is quite  unlike anything that has preceded it. It is intelligent, funny,  ultra-violent, touching, repulsive, in equal measures: and, an  excruciatingly accurate study of maleness and virility to boot (which,  critics take heed, doesn't automatically make the film misogynist [in the  same way the human soap factor doesn't make it anti-Semitic]).Throw  aside your expectations, Fight Club is a modern masterpiece of the dark  fantastic.",5,Who is Tyler Durden?,959558400,"05 29, 2000",2000,2970,"['Fincher', 'Fight', 'Club', 'mysterious', 'semi-darkness', 'comforting', 'disquieting', 'autistic', 'boundless', 'vaguely', 'familiar', 'only', 'when', 'are', 'expelled', 'strangely', 'biomorphic', 'womb-like', 'place', 'realise', 'have', 'been', 'deep', 'recesses', 'protagonist', 'mind', 'shaky', 'pullback', 'emerge', 'Jack', 'mouth', 'barrel', 'gun', 'jammed', 'inside', 'it.Jack', 'loner', 'man', 'going', 'nowhere', 'fast', 'angst-ridden', 'emasculated', 'wage-slave', 'terrible', 'insomnia', 'solace', 'rather', 'bizarrely', 'victim', 'support', 'groups', 'feeding', 'off', 'misery', 'others', 'Sleep', 'last', 'becomes', 'addicted', 'self-help', 'ethos', 'exposed', 'fake', 'attendee', 'Marla', 'group', 'empathy', 'misery-fix', 'soothe', 'troubles', 'Jack', 'deeper', 'depression', 'culminating', 'apartment', 'exploding', 'deep', 'dark', 'night', 'soul', 'Tyler', 'Durden.Tyler', 'Durden', 'embodiment', 'pure', 'id', 'existential', 'nihilist', 'sociopath', 'terrorist', 'inclinations', 'inhabiting', 'dilapidated', 'decaying', 'brownstone', 'edge', 'existence', 'human', 'fat', 'liposuction', 'clinics', 'make', 'soap', 'sell', 'back', 'rich', 'ladies', 'came', 'urinates', 'soup', 'restaurant', 'moonlighting', 'projectionist', 'single', 'frames', 'pornography', 'family', 'movies', 'disruption', 'social', 'ethic', 'prime', 'motivation.When', 'two', 'men', 'get', 'fight', 'Jack', 'amazed', 'how', 'exhilarated', 'raw', 'unfettered', 'violence', 'Consequently', 'Fight', 'Club', 'formed', 'secret', 'society', 'like-minded', 'males', 'prepared', 'go', 'one-on-one', 'bare-knuckles', 'quot', 'first', 'rule', 'Fight', 'Club', 'do', ""n't"", 'talk', 'Fight', 'Club', 'quot', 'movie', 'true', 'too', 'here', 'depart', 'plot', 'details', 'let', 'say', 'Fight', 'Club', 'not', 'fighting', 'picture', 'Van', 'Damme', 'fans', 'be', 'warned', 'far', 'removed', 'escapist', 'blockbuster', 'people', 'expected', 'possible', 'get', 'hence', 'box', 'office', 'failure', 'quite', 'simply', 'Fight', 'Club', 'doubt', 'one', 'most', 'subversive', 'pieces', 'cinema', 'ever', 'denouement', 'twist', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'impossible', 'guess.Based', 'controversial', 'novel', 'Chuck', 'Palanhiuk', 'Fight', 'Club', 'relentlessly', 'dark', 'tortuous', 'journey', 'one', 'man', 'self-discovery', 'Hoisted', 'up', 'greatness', 'Fincher', 'incredible', 'vision', 'career', 'best', 'performances', 'Norton', 'Pitt', 'one', 'rare', 'films', 'quite', 'anything', 'preceded', 'intelligent', 'funny', 'ultra-violent', 'touching', 'repulsive', 'equal', 'measures', 'excruciatingly', 'accurate', 'study', 'maleness', 'virility', 'boot', 'critics', 'take', 'heed', ""n't"", 'automatically', 'make', 'film', 'misogynist', '[', 'same', 'way', 'human', 'soap', 'factor', ""n't"", 'make', 'anti-Semitic', ']', '.Throw', 'aside', 'expectations', 'Fight', 'Club', 'modern', 'masterpiece', 'dark', 'fantastic']",N/A

What 'Fight Club' lacks in compassion it more then makes up for in humor and style. Fincher's direction is near-perfect, shadowy and smooth-flowing camera work highlights every scene. It is a film director's dream come true. The story is a bit strange, to say the least. It's the story of two men: Edward Norton, an insomniac so disillusioned and removed from life that he has to attend support-group meeting in order to feel anything at all. And Brad Pitt, a seemingly unhinged, yet extremely charismatic soap salesman with ego and machismo to burn. The two men meet after Norton's highrise apartment... uh... explodes. They are perfect counterparts, one out of touch with his own manhood, the other a man who wallows in it. They start up an underground boxing club called 'fight club' where men come and beat each other up, apparently to release their frustration and get back in touch with what makes them men in the first place (which I guess is brutality or stupidity, I can't decide which). Everything is going fine until a woman named Marla (Helena Bonham Carter, sexy and snake-like) makes her way into their lives, sparking a bizarre chain of events that leads to terrorism and chaos. The story, from a book by Chuck Palahniuk, is twisted and convoluted, never really making sense until the end where we receive a final plot twist that is so pointless it's revolutionary. But the fine points of the plot never really matter. The only thing that matters is what we're watching on the screen before us at the time. Like a train wreck, the film is dark and repulsive, but we can't turn our eyes away. The bloody fist-fights come to startlingly vivid life on DVD, each thud of a fist hitting skin rockets through us. We squirm and we shudder, but we're fascinated. The movie might not be full of meaning but it is nonetheless remarkable. The performances are all top-notch, especially Meat Loaf in a supporting role as Bob who, due to treatments for testicular cancer, has grown rather large breasts.  The twisted sense of humor of writer Jim Uhls and the fluid, breathtaking direction of David Fincher makes this film more like a rollercoaster then an endurence test. You're retching but laughing all the while. The DVD is AMAZING!!!

518669,A2KG8WLR1AKO12,B00003CWQ2,"David Thomson ""Second Rate Eric Hoffer Imitator""","[40, 77]","The late director, Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece, &quot;Clockwork Orange&quot; is a better movie than &quot;Fight Club.&quot;  This fact,  though, should not deter one from viewing this film that includes the  incredibly talented actors, Brad Pitt and Edward Norton.  These two  artistic masters alone mandate that a serious person take a chance on this  challenging and very disturbing story.Francis Fukuyama's book &quot;The  End of History&quot; came to mind while viewing this dark satirical film.  Fukuyama argued a few years ago that perhaps our society will evolve to the  point where we have essentially accomplished all that can be hoped for in  satisfying our essential needs.  This satiation of all our everyday basic  wants and desires could leave us bored and existentially empty. Do homo  sapien males especially have an innate urge to risk their lives?  What if  there are no wars to be legitimately fought?  Is it possible that the male  gender will always feel an incumbent need to seek an alternative option to  express the violent side of their nature?  Edward Norton portrays a white  collar yuppie about 30 who doesn't have much of a life.  He buys  unnecessary consumer goods merely to give himself something to do and add  to his sense of security. Norton's character earns a living cynically  investigating when it might be better for his employer to pay off on an  individual accident claim instead of ordering a far more expensive  automobile recall.  I usually dislike movies with a strong anti-Capitalist  message.  This is the economic system which has greatly improved the lives  of many throughout the world.  Nonetheless, I put aside this rational  prejudice to see if the director, David Fincher, could offer some insights  into the mind set of those self absorbed males inclined towards violence  merely to alleviate the boredom of their meaningless lives.  My investment  in Fincher was amply rewarded.The Italian Fascist, Benito Mussolini, had  a deep intense hatred for logical thinking and the values of democratic  civilization.  Mussolini argued that violence for its own sake has  redeeming and cathartic value.  True manliness demanded a cold indifference  towards human suffering and a callous disregard for the rights of others  outside one's immediate social group.  &quot;Fight Club&quot; never  directly refers to Mussolini, but Fincher's vision provides us with a  window into the soul's of those attracted to a lifestyle rightfully  perceived as commonly alien and disgusting.  Fincher refuses to romanticize  the converts to the &quot;Fight Club&quot; therapeutic culture. We do not  in anyway envy or wish to emulate these sick and pathetic creatures.  On  the contrary, we are left at the end of the film hoping that such angry and  frustrated males exist primarily only in fiction.  Alas, unfortunately  &quot;Fight Club&quot; mirrors at least a bit of what occasionally occurs  in the real world.  I strongly urge the reader to immediately obtain the  1990 non-fiction book, &quot;Among the Thugs: The Experience, and The  Seduction, of Crowd Violence&quot; by English writer, Bill Buford.

Besides the tremendous &quot;Fight Club&quot; feature presented in all its glorious widescreen perfection (this movie really suffers artistically when cut to the small screen) and pristine CD quality stereo sound (the sound is so important to the effectiveness of the film that this is also a must), you get almost more extras than you know what to do with.  First, the commentary tracks are superb and offer insights into many aspects of the film ranging from its meaning to its construction.  The commentary with David Fincher, Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter is especially enjoyable and makes you feel as if you are in the room watching with them.  At some points it feels as if Helena Bonham Carter's dialogue is injected which leads me to believe that her comments were recorded seperately and that detracts from the comradarie a little bit, but it is still well worth listening to.  The track with David Fincher is very interesting as well especially if you consider, as I do, this man to be among the best directors working today.  He goes into detail about the trials of converting his vision into reality and it is a wonderful insight into the craft of filmaking.  The track with Chuck Palahnuik is very good as well, he seems just tickled to see the movie and is delighted with how well his concept came across on the big screen.  He gives background, through interesting anecdotes, as to where his ideas came from and these stories themselves sound as if they would make a great movie.

This film is one that examines violence not as a means of solving problems, but as a means of verifying your own existence. This movie dares to portray violence not as a completely horrible and ugly part of life, but as something that in some strange way has a sort of purity to it. Not that this movie says it's a good idea to go out and punch someone in the face, but it definitely does challenge you to think about a few things.The film's story follows Jack (not his real name, but see the movie and you'll understand), an empty materialist insomniac who feels very depressed by his life in general. He works for an auto insurance company and spends most of his time and money building the perfect 21st century apartment, complete with all the essentials; IKEA furniture, a home exer-bike, a personal home office unit, and plates with little bubbles inside them, not to mention a wardrobe that was ""almost complete and getting very respectable"". Jack is a typical slave to the consumer culture of America and is a generally soulless and shallow individual with nothing real to live for. He finds some slight satisfaction through attennding meetings for people with diseases, such as tuberculosis, blood and brain parasites, and testicular cancer. Jack finds that going to these meetings allows him to cry, giving him an emotional release for all of his sadness, rage, self loathing, desperation, and whatever other feelings lurk deep inside him; the feelings that he can't purge by ordering furniture. These support groups become his new life, and for a time he finds happiness with them. That is, until another ""faker"", Marla Singer, starts going to Jack's beloved support groups as well. Jack finds that when there's anoter faker present, he is unable to cry, and he is thus robbed of his salvation. Admist all this, things just get worse for Jack as his apartment fills with gas while he is away on business and explodes.After getting over the initial shock of having all his property ripped from him, Jack decides to call Tyler Durden, a man who he had met only several hours before, and who was for a short time Jack's ""single serve friend"". Tyler agrees to meet Jack for a drink, and the 2 of them engage in the first of many philosophical discussions throuoghout the movie, the basis of this one being whether or not Jack is better off without the apartment. After leaving the bar, Jack asks if he can stay with Tyler. Tyler agrees, but with one condition; he wants to fight Jack. Jack is stunned by this request, but agrees and proceeds to punch Tyler directly in the ear. The 2 continue fighting, and eventually involve others who gather around them. Jack finds the same release he found through crying by fighting, and is very taken by his new found interest. This is the beginning of Fight Club, an organization for men wishing to regain their masculinity by beating each other senseless.Speaking from a strictly cinematic standpoint, this is a truly remarkable film. The directing, the writing, and the acting are all top notch. Norton is absolutely incredible as Jack and shows that he will most likely go on to be remembered as one of the greatest actors in the history of film. His expressiveness is amazing and he brings the character to life like no one else could have. Pitt is also great as Durden and brings a mesmerizing presence to the screen. Watching Tyler rant about the demasculinization (I hope that's a real word) of men in modern society is fantastic. Helena Bonham Carter is also impressive as Marla, the only female character in the movie. She was a great choice for the character. Fincher's direction is also phenomenal. The camera work is great and the dark lighting sets a very fitting mood for the movie. The dialogue is clever, original, insightful, and anything and everything else good dialogue should be.This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's creativity is outstanding and the performances are magnificient, plus it never gets boring and the plot twists are great. This is a movie that dares to view violence, masculinity, consumerism, and self realization from an entirely different perspective.

518678,ANGCVJN6WLN2O,B00003CWQ2,"Dennis Bey ""DB""","[14, 16]","UPDATED REVIEW 16/01/2013One of the best movies ever made:  An exercise in ""visual philosophy"", using all technical resources to illustrate and narrate a mental imaginary and machinations based plotline.  Fight Club is a fable of the id, ego, and super ego interacting, to revive the main character (""Jack) from his stupor.  This lethargy and detachment from his bodily needs and id instincts, prevents him to sleep and mate.  His sexual drive and need for love have been channeled into consumerism.  He buys things he doesn't need compulsively, to escape his misery without success.  The solutions he (or his psyche segments) comes up with are evolutionary, but basically of the same substance he longs and aches for to awaken him from this lethargy.  He starts off visiting shockingly bleeding heart -support groups.  Used to the corporate politically correct, neutral and aseptic dialogues, this candidness rattles him up towards vitality, recognizing his own humanity, enlightening the steps to come in the path.  Nirvana is his desired path, the path at the very core of all human being that looks for religion, drugs or any perception of god or what is beyond words and things, and ultimately that ghost inside us.  His Id/super ego is Tyler Durden.  He shows him how to escape from fear.  That fear that drove him to drown himself into things, in work and vapid banality.  Then there comes the Fight Club.  ""Fight club wasn't about winning or losing.  It wasn't about words.""  Says Jack.  It is not about violence in the sense of hurting someone else out of anger, I would add.  Jack is detached from the animal we are, that eats, defecates, has sex and breathes.  Jack is detached from the caveman we have been for thousands of years, that ""evolved"" men despise, but is rooted in our DNA.  Jack is an extreme case of the dangers of excessive consumerism, individuality and materialism of our culture.  Jack fears loosing (a fight, his job, anything that threatens his ego or causes him pain) and longs for human contact and intimacy.  Searching for a relationship is a big stretch.  Baby steps, the support group first. Then fighting furnishes him with all this.I would like to address the movie's critics like Robert Ebert, who fail to seize the zeitgeist and how fight club relates and how the violence is tangential.  The story is about a very particular individual with a very common pathology who seeks a very unorthodox solution in a very dire, desperate situation.  This masterpiece exercises and puts forth ""visual philosophy"", displaying what would be a modern version of Zen enlightenment exercises or Koans.  There is no doctor that treats greed and Ikea fetishes.  This dude is on his own.  He needs to get in touch with his masculinity and loose the fear at the root of all fears, the fear of death,  and so do the other attendees of the Fight Club.Fighting is a start; the fear of physical harm is in the same line.  Guys don't go to Fight Club to win, everyone is a winner, because the target is to unload the burden of fear.  If you desensitize yourself to the fear of punches and blood, abstract fear triggers, as being fired diminish by contrast.  Our culture is plagued with fears of the unknown, the what ifs that blocks us from taking risks that could change or enhance our life.Tyler Durden, the superego is boundless and moves forward unfettered to things that are not realistic for the ego, the pranks and crimes against possessions of the project mayhem.  But before that he confronts Jack with the fear of death using chemical burn.  Crazy, unorthodox yet effective, and more important in a movie: entertaining.Finally, Jack evolves towards love, the main driver from the start.  The movie is a love story.  His relationship with the woman is abrasive, because his sexuality is twisted, hence is expressed through unexpected outlets at the start.  He develops his personality and is able to express caring for a female and start a relationship and integrates his psyche, destroying his overpowering superego.  Metaphorically expressed by the dissolution of Tyler.A beautifully aesthetically stunning crafted movie, fluid as our thouth processes are.  From the start it displays a voyage through the brain's fear center.  As a fable that it is, the use of special effects and creative, aggressive, edgy cinematography suspends your disbelief into a journey in a very human experience, a tale about our war.  As Tyler Durden says when he puts the finger on our greed/consumerism epidemic, ""our war is a spiritual war"".  Interwoven masterfully are the elements of a man's struggle with this disease and fighting our war.  It never stops being an action film.The rant that Tyler delivers to the fight club, encapsulates some of the concerns the movie wants to bring the audience to brood upon. It is one of  the few congruent lines thrown in your  lap to understand the movie and the issues brought to light.  Issues related to living lives without meaning, in mechanic jobs we hate, to buy stuff conditioned by the media to, but that we really don't truly need. We've become consumer droids. Space monkeys conditioned to press buttons towards oblivion. The media offers its carrot: fame, fortune, and every Ego-booster conceivable. And if the entanglement is rooted on the ego logic, ego perception and egotistic behavior it only messes up the problem further.  All reinforces the need to gain awareness of the influence of the ego.The movie doesn't wrap up nicely the answers to these questions, and throws them on your lap.This movie left me with the strong impression of watching one of the most aggressive criticisms towards the dangers of excessive consumerism, of my generation.It is difficult to believe it was made by the director of Seven and two of the most prominent actors of our generation who put their necks on the line to express these concerns.Bravo!!",5,YOU ARE NOT THE MOVIES YOU BUY!!!,1151452800,"06 28, 2006",2006,5899,"['UPDATED',

518679,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B00003CWQ2,Dennis Littrell,"[1, 4]","Director David Fincher, who brought us into the extraordinarily depraved serial-killer world of Se7en (1995), fires up the shock cauldron again with this high testosterone examination of our primal need to seek adrenaline highs through physical violence.  His message seems to be that we are not really alive unless we are involved in something extreme.Ed Norton plays the Narrator, a corporate structure cog with insomnia who gets off (and finds the arms of Morpheus) by going to therapy groups for people with cancer, disfigurement, drug addiction, etc.  The idea is that seeing the acute and terrible misery of others affords him a catharsis that clears the neuro-emotional blockage and allows him to relax enough to get some sleep.But after a while he begins to notice Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter--no relation to Hillary Rodham Clinton--ha, ha) hanging out at some of the meetings.  Her hair and eyes are black widow black, all the better to set off her pasty white skin, giving her a witchy/sexy allure that really in itself ought to excite Norton's deadened neurons.  (I know she excited mine.)  But instead what her presence at the talk-therapy sessions does is remind him that he isn't really suffering like the others, and once again he has insomnia.Meanwhile he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) a handsome and virile beauty soap salesman who is quick with the banter and has the confidence of a demi-god, something Norton's character lacks.  They become best buds (and a bit more) after Durden introduces him to the full-out adrenaline rush of getting your face pounded in.  As the fight club scenes unfold, getting more and more ridiculous with each bone-crunching punch and each darkening pool of blood, more and more young men join the club allowing Tyler Durden to become an underground hero and charismatic leader of human sheep dressed in black.  By the way, the real truth of the postmodern cowboy fisticuffs is that the participants couldn't even stand the injury to their hands from one punch, let alone the repeated blows to face, head and body.But never mind.  There's a lot more to this movie than phony fight scenes.  The strange thing is a lot of the scenes are funny!  Somehow an aura of humor adheres to Fincher's street mayhem, rock-the-house sex, and body-slamming/bone-cracking absurdities.  Not only that but the acting by the principals and Meat Loaf's massively-breasted Bob Paulson is excellent.  Norton's confused and determined whimsy is nicely off-set by Pitt's brazen pathology.  The story plays out well with some nice surprises and some good tension.  You will not be bored.Philosophically speaking too there is more than a grain of truth in the thesis: we really are divorced to some extent from our primal nature.  We are animals who have domesticated ourselves.  A return to the jungle (for example, by watching this film) energizes us and reminds us that part of our nature is largely incompatible with civilization.Be forewarned however that this is a grossly violent movie that is difficult to watch at times.  Fincher's primary intent is to shock, and he works hard at that.  The scene at the back alley of a liposuction clinic as our boys are dumpster-diving for soap ingredients is particularly grossitating.  When one of the bags holding human fat gets snagged on a barbed wire fence, it bursts, dripping it contents onto the Narrator.If you can stand this sort of thing, watch and be beguiled or revolted, but first, please send the kiddies to bed.",4,Shocking the burghers; energizing the proles,1096416000,"09 29, 2004",2004,3503,"['Director', 'David', 'Fincher', 'who', 'brought', 'extraordinarily', 'depraved', 'serial-killer', 'world', 'Se7en', '1995', 'up', 'shock', 'cauldron', 'again', 'high', 'testosterone', 'examination', 'primal', 'need', 'seek', 'adrenaline', 'highs', 'physical', 'violence', 'message', 'be', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'alive', 'are', 'involved', 'something', 'extreme.Ed', 'Norton', 'Narrator', 'corporate', 'structure', 'cog', 'insomnia', 'who', 'arms', 'Morpheus', 'going', 'therapy', 'groups', 'people', 'cancer', 'disfigurement', 'drug', 'addiction', 'etc', 'idea', 'seeing', 'acute', 'terrible', 'misery', 'others', 'affords', 'catharsis', 'neuro-emotional', 'blockage', 'relax', 'enough', 'get', 'sleep.But', 'while', 'notice', 'Marla', 'Singer', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'relation', 'Hillary', 'Rodham', 'Clinton', 'ha', 'ha', 'hanging', 'out', 'meetings', 'hair', 'eyes', 'are', 'black', 'widow', 'black', 'better', 'set', 'off', 'pasty', 'white', 'skin', 'giving', 'witchy/sexy', 'allure', 'really', 'ought', 'excite', 'Norton', 'deadened', 'neurons', 'know', 'excited', 'mine', 'instead', 'what', 'presence', 'talk-therapy', 'sessions', 'remind', ""n't"", 'really', 'suffering', 'others', 'once', 'again', 'insomnia.Meanwhile', 'Tyler', 'Durden', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'handsome', 'virile', 'beauty', 'soap', 'salesman', 'who', 'quick', 'banter', 'confidence', 'demi-god', 'something', 'Norton', 'character', 'lacks', 'become', 'best', 'buds', 'bit', 'more', 'Durden', 'full-out', 'adrenaline', 'rush', 'getting', 'face', 'pounded', 'fight', 'club', 'scenes', 'unfold', 'getting', 'more', 'more', 'ridiculous', 'bone-crunching', 'punch', 'darkening', 'pool', 'blood', 'more', 'more', 'young', 'men', 'join', 'club', 'allowing', 'Tyler', 'Durden', 'become', 'underground', 'hero', 'charismatic', 'leader', 'human', 'sheep', 'dressed', 'black', 'way', 'real', 'truth', 'postmodern', 'cowboy', 'fisticuffs', 'participants', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'stand', 'injury', 'hands', 'one', 'punch', 'let', 'alone', 'repeated', 'blows', 'face', 'head', 'body.But', 'never', 'mind', 'lot', 'more', 'movie', 'phony', 'fight', 'scenes', 'strange', 'thing', 'lot', 'scenes', 'are', 'funny', 'Somehow', 'aura', 'humor', 'adheres', 'Fincher', 'street', 'mayhem', 'rock-the-house', 'sex', 'body-slamming/bone-cracking', 'absurdities', 'Not', 'only', 'acting', 'principals', 'Meat', 'Loaf', 'massively-breasted', 'Bob', 'Paulson', 'excellent', 'Norton', 'confused', 'determined', 'whimsy', 'nicely', 'off-set', 'Pitt', 'brazen', 'pathology', 'story', 'out', 'well', 'nice', 'surprises', 'good', 'tension', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'bored.Philosophically', 'speaking', 'too', 'more', 'grain', 'truth', 'thesis', 'really', 'are', 'divorced', 'extent', 'primal', 'nature', 'are', 'animals', 'who', 'have', 'domesticated', 'ourselves', 'return', 'jungle', 'example', 'watching', 'film', 'part', 'nature', 'largely', 'incompatible', 'civilization.Be', 'forewarned', 'however', 'grossly', 'violent', 'movie', 'difficult', 'watch', 'times', 'Fincher', 'primary', 'intent', 'shock', 'hard', 'scene', 'back', 'alley', 'liposuction', 'clinic', 'boys', 'are', 'dumpster-diving', 'soap', 'ingredients', 'particularly', 'grossitating', 'When', 'one', 'bags', 'holding', 'human', 'fat', 'snagged', 'barbed', 'wire', 'fence', 'dripping', 'Narrator.If', 'can', 'stand', 'sort', 'thing', 'watch', 'be', 'beguiled', 'revolted', 'first', 'please', 'send', 'kiddies', 'bed']",N/A

And what appears to be real in the chaotic world of Edward Norton's unnamed protagonist is anything but, which makes FIGHT CLUB so much fun to watch.  Norton's character is being duped, even though Norton's character is convinced he's on some bizarre road to enlightenment--the vehicle being a ""fight club"" where anarchy rules the day.  And the catalyst to said enlightenment is Norton's unique friend Tyler (Brad Pitt is terrific), who of course is the unnamed protagonist's alter-ego (the articulate and ingenious invisible friend we all have).As the fight club reaches iconic underground status, as the anarchy becomes even more unsettling and bizarre, as the two main characters prattle about in an abandoned, dilapidated, disgusting house, I find myself keenly intent, looking for answers to more questions than I can count.  FIGHT CLUB is clever, grotesque, insightful, often funny, yet as it builds towards its inevitable over-the-top ending it starts to get so silly it gets in its own way.

518688,AJDWUMO2AIUB,B00003CWQ2,D. Miller,"[0, 0]","It's difficult to know what to say about this film without turning my review into a spoiler, so my words will have to be chosen carefully.  We'd had a lot of ""surprise"" films that came out around the same time as Fight Club, so this film fit right in.  A ""surprise"" film defined: just when you think you know what's going on...SURPRISE you don't!Director David Fincher (Se7en, The Game) does another psychological number on us with this one. From a technical standpoint, the cinematography was great...the angles alone made for an entertaining film to watch. And the story only made it better.Edward Norton (Rounders, Primal Fear) gives a captivating performance as a basic white-collar worker who is tired of his 9 to 5, Ikea-furnished existence. His life takes a turn for the better (or is it for the worst?) when he meets Brad Pitt who plays Tyler Durden, an energetic soap-maker. Tyler seems to have the answers to everything and shows him a whole world that he never knew existed...a world where other men take out their anger over their own lives in a secret boxing ring. The boxing ring (known as ""Fight Club"" to its members) is only the jumping off point for a whole string of other events, which Norton gets dragged into. The story is mostly narrated by Norton which is useful in giving us a little more background than we might have had otherwise, and it works well. The only time the narration becomes somewhat distracting was when Norton speaks directly at the camera rather than just being a voice-over. There was only one time that this occurred and seemed rather inconsistent with the rest of the film.Pitt also performed well, and was enjoyable in this role when he was being something of a visionary as well as when he was just downright devious.Helena Bonham Carter (A Room With A View, Howard's End) plays Marla Singer, a girl with some serious issues (drug related and otherwise) who becomes involved with Durden and ends up hanging around more than she is wanted. Carter does an excellent job in this role and definitely seems to have shed any traces of her previous period work.Another surprise in this film was Meat Loaf in the part of Bob, a guy with testicular cancer that you end up really feeling for thanks to Meat Loaf's performance. You can't help but want to hug him.As for the violence, there is a lot. But the film has so much more to it that you can't help but be fascinated anyway. Those who care to look past the violence will find much to mull over. You may find yourself cringing at times, but ultimately unable to turn away. And you may even catch yourself wanting to see it again once you know the ending to try and use your foreknowledge to see what clues you may have missed along the way.Fight Club turned out to be a great way to kill a couple of hours...but it is not a veg-out movie by far.

Mok,"[1, 1]","Rolling Stone's Peter Travers lavished so much praise on this film (four  mentions in his year-end best-of list) that it was with a considerable  amount of sarcasm that I put this tape on.  Happily, the film actually  holds up to the accolades.Though it starts off as yet another  post-modern MTV kind of irreverent thrill-ride, Fight Club soon  distinguishes itself, at first by its performances.  Edward Norton's  low-key conviction scores again; he is the highly able center of this film,  the human core amidst all the dazzling filmmaking, expressionistic  lighting, and strange scenarios.  Helena Bonham Carter also distinguishes  herself, playing to perfection the same kind of nutball she played in  Getting It Right, and by the time Brad Pitt enters the picture, I was  hooked.  Director David Fincher remains one of those directors who could  use the limited Pitt effectively, and Pitt is great in this film -- using  his impressive physicality to the max, staying within his range, and  working like a charm.The film's one fault is overlength.  Nearing its  second hour the film's gross-out humour and sociological and psychological  irreverence start to wear thin, deteriorating into a kind of extended  imitation of a previous Pitt vehicle, 12 Monkeys.  Thankfully, Fincher  concocts another visually impressive, visceral ending to bring life back  into the film, and Norton in the final reel is a delight as he struggles  with his identity crisis.A producer last year made the comment that with  Being John Malkovich, Fight Club and Run Lola Run (perhaps throwing in that  less technically accomplished but still pioneering dark horse, The Blair  Witch Project), filmmaking has entered a new stage.  Having seen two of the  three and discovered that both hold up technically as well as narratively  and dramatically, I'm looking forward to Being John Malkovich.",5,Funny and brutal; walloping kinetic power.,959299200,"05 26, 2000",2000,1874,"['Rolling', 'Stone', 'Peter', 'Travers', 'lavished', 'so', 'much', 'praise', 'film', 'four', 'mentions', 'year-end', 'best-of', 'list', 'was', 'considerable', 'amount', 'sarcasm', 'put', 'tape', 'Happily', 'film', 'actually', 'accolades.Though', 'off', 'yet', 'post-modern', 'MTV', 'kind', 'irreverent', 'thrill-ride', 'Fight', 'Club', 'soon', 'first', 'performances', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'low-key', 'conviction', 'scores', 'again', 'highly', 'able', 'center', 'film', 'human', 'core', 'amidst', 'dazzling', 'filmmaking', 'expressionistic', 'lighting', 'strange', 'scenarios', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'also', 'playing', 'perfection', 'same', 'kind', 'nutball', 'played', 'Getting', 'Right', 'time', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'picture', 'was', 'hooked', 'Director', 'David', 'Fincher', 'one', 'directors', 'who', 'could', 'use', 'limited', 'Pitt', 'effectively', 'Pitt', 'great', 'film', 'using', 'impressive', 'physicality', 'max', 'staying', 'range', 'working', 'charm.The', 'film', 'one', 'fault', 'overlength', 'Nearing', 'second', 'hour', 'film', 'gross-out', 'humour', 'sociological', 'psychological', 'irreverence', 'start', 'wear', 'thin', 'deteriorating', 'kind', 'extended', 'imitation', 'previous', 'Pitt', 'vehicle', '12', 'Monkeys', 'Thankfully', 'Fincher', 'visually', 'impressive', 'visceral', 'ending', 'bring', 'life', 'back', 'film', 'Norton', 'final', 'reel', 'delight', 'identity', 'crisis.A', 'producer', 'last', 'year', 'made', 'comment', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Fight', 'Club', 'Run', 'Lola', 'Run', 'perhaps', 'throwing', 'less', 'technically', 'accomplished', 'still', 'pioneering', 'dark', 'horse', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'filmmaking', 'entered', 'new', 'stage', 'Having', 'seen', 'two', 'three', 'discovered', 'hold', 'up', 'technically', 'as', 'well', 'narratively', 'dramatically', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich']",N/A

I'm not sure if the giddy fan boy in me could have gone without seeing how they made Edward Norton see a penguin on that second disc.The movie itself is a triumph, a nice little send-up of the corporate world in which we live. The Narrator (henceforth referred to as ""Jack"") lives a comfortable life: a good job with a ""major"" car company, a large apartment, plenty of cash, IKEA furniture ... oh, but wait. Jack can't sleep. For some reason or another, he suffers from insomnia.After finding solace in support groups and having that taken away from him, he meets an interest person named Tyler Durden who, after a hilarious incidence, opens his home, and his philosophies, to Jack.Tyler is the anti-yes-man. He hates everything about modern life, how everyone feel the need to fill their lives with garbage, how they're all led to believe they'll become millionaires and rock stars. It sickens him. In a world in which men have been stripped of their primal maleness, Tyler invites them into a world where they can give into their darker sides and fight it out with each other. Of course, Tyler has much deeper plans than that...Without wanting to give away much more of the plot, you will enjoy this movie if: you've ever looked at something you ""have to"" like with utter contempt and disbelief, if you've ever felt within you a need for something higher than modernized life, or just plain hate suits. Sometimes, granted, Tyler's teachings seem a little shaky, but this IS a movie (and an excellent book), not a guidebook. The movie is trying to make a point, not force you to bend to its will; that's what society does.As films go, this is probably in my top 10, definitely in my top 25 films of all time. Fincher does an amazing job directing, using CGI in inventive, sparing ways. Brad Pitt continued with his success on ""Se7en"" and pulls off a great Tyler. Ed Norton plays the perfect begrudged IKEA-boy. Helena Bonham Carter .... to be honest, I hated, despises her character the first time I saw this, but I find her more likable with each watching. The real surprise of this movie was Meat Loaf, who play sensitive bodybuilder Bob ... and almost outshines the two stars.As for special features, this is a pretty darn nice collection. Mostly short documentaries on how they did some of the special effects (the penguin, the plane, Jack's catalogue apartment, the ... two special effects shots for the ending) which are interesting. The fashion designs are ... pictures of clothes. Never very interesting except to see what Tyler could've been wearing (and he wore some crazy stuff in the film). The deleted scenes actually add a bit to the movie (Tyler quitting smoking in one of them (!)).The real gem of the second disc, at least, is the Publicity Gallery.The commercials and trailers are nothing too special, but the Public Service announcements are sidesplitting. Sadly, there are only two, but one features Ed and the other Brad telling the audience normal theatre going  procedure (where the exits are, turn of cell phones) and then end with each saying something odd... I doubt I'll be allowed to repeat Tylers's, but Jack says, out of the blue ""Remember: NO ONE has the right to touch you in your bathing suit area!""This is the one DVD collection in which the special features are equal to the film. The single-disc edition contains everything on the first disc, which is pretty much the commentary. Still, I think hunting down the double disc edition is well worth the $30 you may have to shell out to get it. I mean, what else are you going to spend it on?

If it impresses with the chances it takes in narrative form and cinematic bravado, it also proves problematic, cohering only on a peripheral level and ending its tale with a rather forced resolution that doesn't quite pull the thematic elements together. Fincher is, without a doubt, a talented director with a visual style all of his own; he produced ""Fight Club"" with a sparkling clear, but gloomy, photography that highlights its exisentialist ideas. But the telling is too forceful and heavy-handed, relaying its meaning and themes with blinders on. But by far the biggest drawback is that ""Fight Club"" is not as smart as it thinks it is. Its philosophy is ultimately too simplistic to be convincing.Among relatively new directors, Fincher is at the head of his class; his style is sophisticated enough to be taken seriously, and he generally handles his films with impressive skill. It's a treat to see, for example, how well he combines CGI techniques with traditional camerawork in this film.  But his direction is far from perfect.  While it's not a fault of the film by any means, my other problem with ""Fight Club"" is the mythic status it has attained among specific segments of the movie-going public. It's a film that is prone to over-intellectualizing and hyberbole, and since its release it has been a victim of both.

518698,ARH9IQEMFKR6M,B00003CWQ2,Doug Vaughn,"[29, 37]","Fight Club has to be one of the best films I have seen in years. A complex, well acted, beautifully flimed drama about one man's descent into madness, it is alive with dark humor, violent action, emotional turmoil,  skillful plotting and really insightful commentary on social life and  society at century's end.Ed Norton and Brad Pitt are exceptional. As  different as night and day, it isn't possible to compare their  performances, but since they exist in the film as foils for one another's  characters they create together a wonderful balance - an edgy give and take  that is at the heart of the film's exciting dynamic. Helena Bonham Carter,  free for once of the aristocratic pretensions of her usual film characters,  can't begin to measure up. She doesn't have the heat on screen that Norton  and Pitt bring to their parts. Meat Loaf, in a surprisingly touching  characterization, brings more to the screen - in every sense - than Carter  does.It isn't fair to try and elaborate on the plot because the twists  and ambiguities are a large part of the fun - and of the darker purpose of  the film. But it is worthwhile to point out what the film is not; it is not  a typical &quot;guy&quot; film. It uses the boy-centered, testosterone  fueled theme of the 'fight club', a club that exists strictly for the  purpose of providing guys an opportunity to fight, to make a valid critical  statement about urban societ today - men feel isolated, adrift, untested,  worthless and tame. Fight club gives its members confidence, provides a  chance for them to express their anger and aggression, creates contact and  bonding, fills the emptiness and gives them purpose. Watching the fight  club go from an informal gathering for a few to a rule based movement  spreading like wildfire across the country is almost surreal.There is  lots of savage humor in this film.

Terribly marketed in its theatrical run as a knuckle-dragging modern rendition of Bloodsport, it's sharper, wittier and ballsier than almost any major studio film of the last two decades. It's a rapidly escalating thrill ride that never hesitates to crank the dial a bit further, and the progression from droll normalcy to vulgar aggression to unsettling calm in the face of a genuine revolution is stunning. On top of all that, the film's wit is off the charts, still intelligent and amusing after two dozen viewings; its cast of characters is wildly varied, and its smirk-smeared musings on the nature of modern masculinity remain timely even today. I actually get shivers every time I revisit particular scenes, with the biggest one coming - reliably - just moments before the credits roll when that Pixies tune kicks in and the city skyline takes a new shape.

Fairly harmless premise and if it ended there it would be acceptable, however the fights have several motives: 1. they're used to desensitize the viewer to aggressive violence for whats to come later and 2. the harmless fight clubs have the same form and structure as the terroristic Project Mayhem, so the film tries to convince the viewer that if Fight Clubs are good, terroristic Project Mayhem is good.They bring you on board with the fights and reinforce the view that 'regular' life is so awful you cant make anything of it so just give up on it. A horribly cynical and destructive view of life. Once they have your thinking on this inevitable track, they then push you along to making terrorism an extension of Fight Club(i.e. cool). Strangely enough the film rails against society endlessly through the film yet the target of Project Mayhem are credit card companies. If society is so unredeemable how would blowing up credit card companies and resetting debt to 0 accomplish anything at all? The film doesnt even make sense in its own perverted world view.Once Project Mayhem becomes revealed the film becomes more and more hazy on what exactly is going on. Obviously its some sort of internal struggle, some say its a visual depiction of mind control, some say MPD. The film didnt have the guts to explain itself so we'll never know for sure.All I do know is that anyone suggesting someone give up on life and actively destroy society because its not perfect(which is exactly what this film suggests) is wrong.

Fight Club has nothing to do with societal problems or moral decay.  Fight Club doesn't even have anything to do with fighting.  Fight Club is about the interior landscape of the human soul and the struggle to become.But please, please, see Fight Club for yourself and you decide.  I liked Fight Club when I saw it in the theater, but the main plot twist frankly took most of my attention.  It wasn't until I started watching this DVD that I actually got Fight Club. I've now seen Fight Club more than 10 times, and I'm still picking up things I hadn't connected before.There is so much to this movie I can't begin to even talk about it.  With each viewing it seems more impossible that any major studio would even touch this movie!  Instead, let me say that this DVD edition is the DVD I measure all others against.  It is superb.  There are piles of extras, including multiple documentaries on the making of the movie.  There are also different commentary tracks.  The main commentary track, with Norton, Pitt, Carter, and Filcher, is the most interesting, and the one I'd suggest you listen to after watching the movie a few times.  You may find as I did that it helps you pick up even more the next time you watch the movie with the commentary off.  Also, Fight Club is a movie made for viewing on DVD.

Packed with tons of special features, easy interactivity from pop-up menus, four crazy commentary tracks, the ""I am Jack's Search Index"" (which is all levels of handy if you want to see or hear a specific bit of info without having to dig around for it), public safety announcements (worth the cost of the BD alone); we also get a few exclusive behind the scenes featurettes.The story is subtle, complex, and comes crashing by like a runaway train. Then, the train crashes. And you can't look away even if your life depended on it. Fight Club suggests that we don't need all the things we allow to hold us in the material world. Fight Club dares you think outside you own little world and asks ""what would you be willing to do for the greater good of mankind?""The protagonist isn't even given a name, which actually serves to endear him to our open arms, feeling sorry for a poor man who can't sleep and is without a single iota of fun or meaningfulness. He meets a guy, and together they go on a totally psychotic self-discovery trip. And as they go, they gain groupies. What happens... is not expected.Every one from the camera man to the cast is simply incredible; there is no way possible for me to overstate anything about this film. Some people make negative remarks siting the violence as unnecessary. But man (as in humans) has nothing but a history of violence in one way or another. Don't go into this movie with preconceptions or judgments before hand. Once the credits roll, take an hour or so to think about everything that is said and done throughout the film. At the end of the day, this movie is about truth in self-discovery. So take it all in, breath it in, and ask yourself ""do I conform or do I act on my own?""It's kinda like an introspective documentary, seasoned with blood sweat and tears, wrapped with banality, and with side orders of dark humour and fist-fightings with plenty to go around.I am Jack's Reviewer.

Fincher, the director, shows again his ability to mold a movie like clay,  to shape it into whatever style is necessary to convey its dark, moral  shape.  The cast backs him up with intensity and bravado.&quot;Fight  Club,&quot; as implied by the title, is not for the faint-of-heart, for the  self-appointed morality squads, or for those interested in mere  entertainment...This movie wants to say something--and, in case you're hard  of hearing, it'll even yell out its sermonettes at times.  No, not every  lesson hits home.  Some fly off the mark, and some get lost behind the  violent foreground--but others hit you like a bullet between the  eyes.Jack begins as an insomniac, &quot;not really asleep, and not  really awake.&quot;  As he finds himself addicted to the close-knit feeling  of support groups, he becomes an emotional junkie, attending meeting after  meeting with bogus ailments--anything for his next hug, his next  &quot;fix.&quot;  These scenes, though humorous at times, touch on deep  felt longings and feelings in us all. But when Jack realizes that another  person, Marla Singer, is also using the groups for her own devices, his  ecstasy is shattered.  His own shallowness, reflected through her, becomes  a thorn in his side.Jack begins losing sleep again...Until he meets  Tyler Durden.  Soon, the two inseparable partners commit themselves to an  anti-social life, pursuing answers and meaning in a world ruled by  capitalistic emptiness.  &quot;The things you own... own you!&quot; Tyler  declares.  And the two set out to be free men by casting aside most things  society holds dear.Their intentions and their courage to cast aside  convention in the pursuit of a better way left me simultaneously stunned  and cheering and repulsed.  As the film churns inexorably toward its  violent and surprising conclusion, I, like Jack, found myself awakening  from this bad dream, hoping there was time and means to redeem the chaos  unleashed.But it wasn't to be.Like the young men in the classic  novel, &quot;Lord of the Flies,&quot; the men of Fight Club spiral downward  into their own moral mire, resulting in death and destruction.  Unlike  &quot;Lord of the Flies,&quot; there are no rescuers on the horizon this  time around.  The results of their soul-searching-gone-mad prove explosive  and unstoppable.In the end, Jack and Tyler's questions and  frustrations go unanswered, and we are left with the dark realization that  these questions cannot be ignored.  Their search short-circuits almost  before it begins; the paths they travel lead to emptiness.But are  answers out there?

At first, I didn't really know what the VHS box was talking about in its description of Jack being a ticking-time bomb insomniac until I finished watching the movie. It's a bit complex to explain anything about this movie since it's one of those psychological comedies. The movie stars Edward Norton (one of my current favorite actors) and Brad Pitt as well as Helena Bonham Carter, Jared Leto and Meat Loaf. The flick starts off with Edward Norton who plays simply the ""narrator"" but hinted with the notification of Jack as he sits on a chair with a gun in his mouth pointed by Brad Pitt who plays Tyler Durden. You are then taken moments and perhaps days before what had led up to the circumstances. Jack is an insomniac who is looking to decorate his condo with new furniture and home designs to maybe reshape his depression. He starts attending sessions for those who need the same help as him but ends up sprawling back into depression and insomnia when a fake cancer victim steps into the picture. Eventually things get out of hand for Jack and things aren't as they seem and you find out that he's actually ""insane"" lol with serious emotional problems. You'll have to watch this flick to understand what I'm saying. Jack and Tyler Durden are the same person but in different perspectives. Tyler is who Jack wants to be like and everything that Jack wants to be is Tyler Durden. Anyway, FIGHT CLUB is basically a club for males to release their anger and emotions as they channel primal male aggression beating each other senseless until one of them gives up or gets knocked out. The therapy shockingly works for Jack and the whole system is topped with rules. Through many zany moments, you will find yourself trapped in a maze of questions but everything will reveal itself slowly as the film proceeds to the mind-blowing climax. The bottomline is that this movie delivers no remorse with pure style. Booming with a soundtrack by the Dust Brothers and a concept so worth picking the title up for.

But it was more than that. This film is without a doubt one of the most stylistic and smart films I have seen, and is definetly Edward Norton's best film. Norton, who narrates the film has a dead-end job and an unfulfilling life. As he see's it, his life is one of a drab-consumer-oriented-yuppy trying to keep up with the american dream: such as acquiring as many material possessions as possible through his unrelenting purchase of consumer goods. This will make him happy right? Wrong, it only makes him despise himself and others like him all the more. There is an anti-consumerism message being played out here in Norton's pysche. And thus, an insomniac is born.Enter Norton's alter-ego Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) who gives an equally impressive acting performace. I must admit, the film took me totally by surprise. As for the violence in the film, it is only a means to an end in telling the story. The fight club itself is not the main idea behind the film, only a vehicle for advancing the film. It's the mental breakdown of Norton, and his split personalities that I found totally original in the film, and how this is brought to a conclusion that floored me. The ending of the film is one of the best I have ever seen--and especially with the music of the Pixies blaring away as the building's are collapsing. A great film, and highly recommended.

Brad Pitt was, by far, already spotlighted by the late 90s, but Edward Norton had yet to have a role that really put him into America's consciousness.  This movie did it all.  Based off of Chuck's book by the same title, Fight Club is a masterful blend of action, thrill, psychology, romance, comedy, and critique on American consumerism and what it does to those of us that can't seem to break our norms.The narrator, only referred to lightly as Jack, has a problem with insomnia, works at a terrible job, and peppers his life with useless material goods.  All of that comes crashing down when he meets Tyler, played by Brad Pitt.  A suave, cool cat that seems to have an answer for everything, Tyler ushers Jack into a whirlwind of mayhem that all starts with the creation of soap and ends with explosives.  Tyler upsets the established order of life, lives as a minimalist, yet dreams large enough to think about changing the world even though he is, for all intents and purposes, a nobody.  He is about living life and not squandering it, about making a sub-culture of dreams out of the mindless drones of America, and striking fear into an order run by bureaucrats who are more concerned about their money than about the livelihood of the most important thing in life: life itself.A fantastic movie for all who just want to wake up and smell the nitroglycerin.

If you think this is some best of the best street fighter type movie, you're wrong. There are actually only a few fight scenes in the entire movie, although they do get pretty brutal. This is really more a film about the human condition, and mind. What makes us tick. Why we do what we do, and the absurdity of it all. The cultist sheepish mentality in which we live our lives.Ed Norton's narrative in this movie is truly hypnotic, as are the visuals. It's a well written, well acted, beautifully filmed thought provoking movie. I totally disagree with the movies leftist and violent anti-establishment message, but I throughly enjoyed the movie nonetheless. There are a lot of thought provoking comments and moments in the movie that might just make you rethink certain elements and behaviors in your own life.It's an interesting look at how we perceive ourselves, how we cope, what we value, and what we disregard. All of the characters in this movie are heavily flawed people.The plot jumps around a bit and some of the story elements of the movie are a bit tough to swallow including the major plot twist of the movie. Overall, This is a very unique movie, and well worth seeing. I always notice ""cigarette burns"" at the theaters now.The irony of this review and all the other others here, is that Tyler, one the main characters in the movie, would probably ridicule me for writing this review and you for wasting your time reading it.

518723,A2YERZIIW4HRSB,B00003CWQ2,"""flamefire""","[29, 36]","Fight Club&quot; an aggressive, confrontational, often brutal satire that is quite possibly a brilliant masterpiece. Taking the &quot;Choose life,&quot; anti-consumerism rant at the beginning of  &quot;Trainspotting,&quot; and carrying it to its logical -- albeit extreme  -- conclusion this is a big budget, mainstream film that takes a lot of  risks by biting the hand that feeds it. The film's narrator (Edward Norton)  is an insignificant cog in the drab, corporate machine, dutifully doing his  job and what he's told without question. He's an insomniac slave to his  IKEA possessions and only finds joy in going to as many self-help/dealing  with terminal diseases sessions as he can. It provides him with an escape  from his sleepless nights. That is, until Marla Singer (Helena Bonham  Carter), a trashy chain-smoking poser, enters his life and upsets his  routine. The narrator also meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a charismatic  soap salesman whose straightforward honesty, candor and sleazy  lounge-lizard outfits are a breath of fresh air. One night, after the two  men have bonded over beers, Tyler asks the narrator to hit him. At first,  it seems like an absurd request but after they pound on each other for a  bit, a strange feeling overcomes them. They feel a kind of release and  satisfaction at inflicting pain on one another. In a world where people are  desensitized to everything around them, the physical contact of fighting  wakes them up and makes them feel truly alive. Others soon join in and  pretty soon Fight Club becomes an underground sensation. However, it  becomes readily apparent that Tyler has more elaborate plans than just  organizing brawls at the local bar. David Fincher has taken the dark,  pessimistic worldview of &quot;Seven&quot; and married it with the clever  plot twists and turns of &quot;The Game&quot; and assembled his strongest  effort to date. &quot;Fight Club&quot; is a $50+ million studio film that  remains true to its anti-consumer, anti-society, anti-everything message --  right up to the last, sneaky subliminal frame. What makes &quot;Fight  Club&quot; a subversive delight is not only its refreshing anti-corporate  message but how it delivers said message. As Fincher has explained in  interviews, you don't really watch the film but rather download it. Its  structure is extremely playful as it messes around with linear time to an  incredible degree. The narrative bounces back and forth all over the place  like a novel, or surfing on the Internet -- even making a hilarious dead  stop to draw attention to itself in a funny, interesting way that  completely works. Yet Norton's deadpanned narration holds everything  together and allows the viewer to get a handle on what's happening. This is  the way films should be made. Why must we always have to go through the  A+B+C formula? &quot;Fight Club&quot; openly rejects this tired, clearly  outdated structure in favour of a stylized frenzy of jump cuts, freeze  frames, slow motion and every other film technique in the book that only  reinforces its anarchistic message. A film like this would have never been  greenlighted by a major studio if Brad Pitt had not been attached to the  project. Once you see the film, it becomes obvious that he was the only  choice for Tyler Durden. Like he did with &quot;Kalifornia&quot; and  &quot;Twelve Monkeys&quot;, Pitt grunges himself down and disappears  completely into his role to a frighteningly convincing degree. During many  of the brutal fight scenes, he is transformed into a bloody, pulpy mess  that'll surely have the &quot;Legends of the Fall&quot; fans running for  the exits. It is an incredible performance -- probably his best -- for the  simple fact that he becomes the character so completely. If Pitt has the  flashy, gonzo role, Edward Norton is his perfect foil as the seemingly meek  yet sardonic narrator. It's a deceptively understated performance as the  last third of the film reveals but Norton nails it perfectly. He is clearly  our surrogate, our introduction into this strange world and his wry  observations on our consumer-obsessed culture are right on the money. They  are the perfect setup for Tyler's introduction and his view on the world  which is clearly a call to arms of sorts, a manifesto that rejects the  notion that we are what we own. And ultimately, that is what &quot;Fight  Club&quot; tries to do. The film is a cinematic punch to the head as it  challenges the status quo and offers a wakeup call to people immersed in a  materialistic world where those who have the most stuff, &quot;win.&quot; I  think that Fincher's film wants us to tear all that down, reject corporate  monsters like Starbucks and Blockbuster, and try to figure out what we  really want out of life. It's almost as if the film is suggesting salvation  through self-destruction. And it is these thought-provoking ideas that  makes &quot;Fight Club&quot; a dangerously brilliant film that entertains  as well as enlightens.",5,Entertaining &amp; Enlightening,958608000,"05 18, 2000",2000,5008,"['Fight', 'Club', 'quot', 'aggressive', 'confrontational', 'often', 'brutal', 'satire', 'quite', 'possibly', 'brilliant', 'masterpiece', 'Taking', 'quot', 'Choose', 'life', 'quot', 'anti-consumerism', 'rant', 'beginning', 'quot', 'Trainspotting', 'quot', 'carrying', 'logical', 'albeit', 'extreme', 'conclusion', 'big', 'budget', 'mainstream', 'film', 'lot', 'risks', 'biting', 'hand', 'film', 'narrator', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'insignificant', 'cog', 'drab', 'corporate', 'machine', 'dutifully', 'doing', 'job', 'what', 'told', 'question', 'insomniac', 'slave', 'IKEA', 'possessions', 'only', 'joy', 'going', 'many', 'self-help/dealing', 'terminal', 'diseases', 'sessions', 'can', 'escape', 'sleepless', 'nights', 'Marla', 'Singer', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'trashy', 'chain-smoking', 'poser', 'life', 'routine', 'narrator', 'also', 'Tyler', 'Durden', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'charismatic', 'soap', 'salesman', 'straightforward', 'honesty', 'candor', 'sleazy', 'lounge-lizard', 'outfits', 'are', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'One', 'night', 'two', 'men', 'have', 'bonded', 'beers', 'Tyler', 'narrator', 'hit', 'first', 'absurd', 'request', 'pound', 'other', 'bit', 'strange', 'feeling', 'feel', 'kind', 'release', 'satisfaction', 'inflicting', 'pain', 'one', 'world', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'desensitized', 'everything', 'around', 'physical', 'contact', 'fighting', 'wakes', 'up', 'feel', 'truly', 'alive', 'Others', 'soon', 'join', 'pretty', 'soon', 'Fight', 'Club', 'underground', 'sensation', 'However', 'readily', 'apparent', 'Tyler', 'more', 'elaborate', 'plans', 'just', 'organizing', 'brawls', 'local', 'bar', 'David', 'Fincher', 'taken', 'dark', 'pessimistic', 'worldview', 'quot', 'Seven', 'quot', 'married', 'clever', 'plot', 'twists', 'turns', 'quot', 'Game', 'quot', 'assembled', 'strongest', 'effort', 'date', 'quot', 'Fight', 'Club', 'quot', '50+', 'million', 'studio', 'film', 'true', 'anti-consumer', 'anti-society', 'anti-everything', 'message', 'right', 'up', 'last', 'sneaky', 'subliminal', 'frame', 'What', 'quot', 'Fight', 'Club', 'quot', 'subversive', 'delight', 'not', 'only', 'refreshing', 'anti-corporate', 'message', 'how', 'said', 'message', 'Fincher', 'explained', 'interviews', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'watch', 'film', 'rather', 'download', 'structure', 'extremely', 'playful', 'linear', 'time', 'incredible', 'degree', 'narrative', 'bounces', 'back', 'forth', 'place', 'novel', 'surfing', 'Internet', 'even', 'making', 'hilarious', 'dead', 'stop', 'draw', 'attention', 'funny', 'interesting', 'way', 'completely', 'Norton', 'deadpanned', 'narration', 'everything', 'together', 'viewer', 'get', 'handle', 'what', 'happening', 'way', 'films', 'should', 'be', 'made', 'Why', 'must', 'always', 'have', 'go', 'A+B+C', 'formula', 'quot', 'Fight', 'Club', 'quot', 'openly', 'tired', 'clearly', 'outdated', 'structure', 'favour', 'stylized', 'frenzy', 'jump', 'cuts', 'freeze', 'frames', 'slow', 'motion', 'other', 'film', 'technique', 'book', 'only', 'anarchistic', 'message', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'greenlighted', 'major', 'studio', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'attached', 'project', 'Once', 'see', 'film', 'obvious', 'was', 'only', 'choice', 'Tyler', 'Durden', 'did', 'quot', 'Kalifornia', 'quot', 'quot', 'Twelve', 'Monkeys', 'quot', 'Pitt', 'down', 'disappears', 'completely', 'role', 'frighteningly', 'convincing', 'degree', 'many', 'brutal', 'fight', 'scenes', 'transformed', 'bloody', 'pulpy', 'mess', ""'ll"", 'surely', 'have', 'quot', 'Legends', 'Fall', 'quot', 'fans', 'running', 'exits', 'incredible', 'performance', 'probably', 'best', 'simple', 'fact', 'character', 'so', 'completely', 'Pitt', 'flashy', 'gonzo', 'role', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'perfect', 'foil', 'seemingly', 'meek', 'yet', 'sardonic', 'narrator', 'deceptively', 'understated', 'performance', 'last', 'third', 'film', 'reveals', 'Norton', 'perfectly', 'clearly', 'surrogate', 'introduction', 'strange', 'world', 'wry', 'observations', 'consumer-obsessed', 'culture', 'are', 'right', 'money', 'are', 'perfect', 'setup', 'Tyler', 'introduction', 'view', 'world', 'clearly', 'call', 'arms', 'sorts', 'manifesto', 'notion', 'are', 'what', 'own', 'ultimately', 'what', 'quot', 'Fight', 'Club', 'quot', 'tries', 'do', 'film', 'cinematic', 'punch', 'head', 'status', 'quo', 'wakeup', 'call', 'people', 'immersed', 'materialistic', 'world', 'where', 'who', 'have', 'most', 'stuff', 'quot', 'quot', 'think', 'Fincher', 'film', 'tear', 'down', 'reject', 'corporate', 'monsters', 'Starbucks', 'Blockbuster', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'really', 'want', 'life', 'almost', 'film', 'suggesting', 'salvation', 'self-destruction', 'thought-provoking', 'ideas', 'quot', 'Fight', 'Club', 'quot', 'dangerously', 'brilliant', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'enlightens']",N/A

518725,A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B00003CWQ2,"Flap Jackson ""Sky Is Burning, But At Least We...","[3, 3]","Oh the movie males of the 1999/2000. Neo from The Matrix, Lester Burnham from American Beauty, Peter Gibbons from Office Space, The Narrator from Fight Club, Patrick Bateman of American Psycho. All of these men have the same thing in common. At the start of their respective movies, they're living in their own personal hell and are facing crises that must be remedied. Neo finds the Matrix, Lester finds beauty in the world, Peter steals from his company, while The Narrator & Patrick turn to more primal methods of coping. Sometimes the cause from these crises is due to consumerism, but it is often brought on by familiarity, which of course breeds contempt.Fight Club & American Psycho are the perfect companions for each other however, as they both contain all the above themes, and both deal with primal remedies that deal with madness and insanity in a world that inevitably breeds madness and insanity. American Psycho deals with the 80s, and how the Yuppie culture essentially created a bunch of consumerist clones. Fight Club deals with the late 90s/00s and how society has essentially made us into a bunch of wimps due to our lack of societal hardships to rise against. Where American Psycho leaves off, Fight Club takes and runs with. For the purposes of this review however, we shall analyse Fight Club.The Narrator is caught in a world of familiarity. He travels and gets to see America, but it's all the same to him. He works for a terrible and probably selfish company, and when he's in an office environment, it's soul-sucking. As a result, he can't sleep, and his lack of sleep is a reflection of his life's familiarity, and this familiarity starts breeding contempt, so he starts attending support groups so he can let his emotions through tears. And for a year, this actually work, and it probably would have kept working too if it hadn't been for Marla. Truly, Marla Singer set into motion the events of the rest of the movie because without her, The Narrator is perfectly content to cry his frustrations and emotions away. But since she is a distraction, his life is messed up again, so he takes the philosophical route. In the moment, right after the line ""If you wake up at a different time in a different place, could you wake up as a different person?,"" Tyler Durden appears. Bingo. The Narrator has just found the ultimate form of societal rebellion.You see, The Narrator/Tyler Durden sees society as a bunch of wimpy zombies. Rendered numb by society. Wondering around because they don't know what else to do. They take the easy path because it's the only path they've ever been on. The rebellion starts out small at first, with fighting. Then it turns into guerilla terrorism. But then, it all goes to hell. At some point, something went wrong. ""His Name is Robert Paulson."" Those are the words that send a wake-up call to The Narrator. Something has gone horribly wrong. He's been working for a way to free society from being zombies, yet he's created an ultimate army of zombies. The first rule of Fight Club is to never talk about Fight Club, yet everywhere he goes, everybody knows about Fight Club. Tyler Durden is just a name. A figment of an imagination. A shadowy figure that was born and resides only in legend. Thus, as The Narrator stands holding hands with Marla, watching the improbable financial collapse of America, there's no redemption except for death. He's gone on a journey to escape his own personal hell only to create another one, even more personal than the last, even worse because it's of his own doing. He can kill Tyler Durden, but Tyler Durden still lives on in all that's been created. There's no way to dissolve Project Mayhem. There's no way to stop the financial collapse. There's no way to live with himself. This is the cautionary tale of Fight Club. The tale of a man so numb, he took punches just to feel something, and wanted the rest of the world to be free. But with freedom comes a price, and a price that defeats the freedom in first place.The story is well-put together, brilliantly written, stunningly put-together, perfectly acted, hilarious, memorable, and most of all, thought-provoking, Fight Club is a quasi-modern masterpiece.",5,I Am Jack's In-Depth & Glorious Review of Fight Club,1284249600,"09 12, 2010",2010,4205,"['Oh', 'movie', 'males', '1999/2000', 'Neo', 'Matrix', 'Lester', 'Burnham', 'American', 'Beauty', 'Peter', 'Gibbons', 'Office', 'Space', 'Narrator', 'Fight', 'Club', 'Patrick', 'Bateman', 'American', 'Psycho', 'men', 'have', 'same', 'thing', 'common', 'start', 'respective', 'movies', ""'re"", 'living', 'own', 'personal', 'hell', 'are', 'facing', 'crises', 'must', 'be', 'remedied', 'Neo', 'Matrix', 'Lester', 'beauty', 'world', 'Peter', 'steals', 'company', 'Narrator', 'Patrick', 'turn', 'more', 'primal', 'methods', 'coping', 'Sometimes', 'cause', 'crises', 'due', 'consumerism', 'often', 'brought', 'familiarity', 'course', 'breeds', 'contempt.Fight', 'Club', 'American', 'Psycho', 'are', 'perfect', 'companions', 'other', 'however', 'contain', 'above', 'themes', 'deal', 'primal', 'remedies', 'deal', 'madness', 'insanity', 'world', 'inevitably', 'madness', 'insanity', 'American', 'Psycho', 'deals', '80s', 'how', 'Yuppie', 'culture', 'essentially', 'created', 'bunch', 'consumerist', 'clones', 'Fight', 'Club', 'late', '90s/00s', 'how', 'society', 'essentially', 'made', 'bunch', 'wimps', 'due', 'lack', 'societal', 'hardships', 'rise', 'Where', 'American', 'Psycho', 'off', 'Fight', 'Club', 'purposes', 'review', 'however', 'shall', 'analyse', 'Fight', 'Club.The', 'Narrator', 'caught', 'world', 'familiarity', 'see', 'America', 'same', 'terrible', 'probably', 'selfish', 'company', 'when', 'office', 'environment', 'soul-sucking', 'result', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sleep', 'lack', 'sleep', 'reflection', 'life', 'familiarity', 'familiarity', 'breeding', 'contempt', 'attending', 'support', 'groups', 'can', 'let', 'emotions', 'tears', 'year', 'actually', 'work', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'kept', 'working', 'too', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'Marla', 'Truly', 'Marla', 'Singer', 'set', 'motion', 'events', 'rest', 'movie', 'Narrator', 'perfectly', 'content', 'cry', 'frustrations', 'emotions', 'away', 'distraction', 'life', 'messed', 'up', 'again', 'philosophical', 'route', 'moment', 'right', 'line', 'wake', 'up', 'different', 'time', 'different', 'place', 'could', 'wake', 'up', 'different', 'person', 'Tyler', 'Durden', 'Bingo', 'Narrator', 'just', 'found', 'ultimate', 'form', 'societal', 'rebellion.You', 'see', 'Narrator/Tyler', 'Durden', 'society', 'bunch', 'wimpy', 'zombies', 'Rendered', 'numb', 'society', 'Wondering', 'around', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'else', 'do', 'take', 'easy', 'path', 'only', 'path', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'been', 'rebellion', 'out', 'small', 'first', 'fighting', 'Then', 'guerilla', 'terrorism', 'then', 'hell', 'point', 'something', 'went', 'wrong', 'Name', 'Robert', 'Paulson', 'are', 'words', 'send', 'wake-up', 'call', 'Narrator', 'Something', 'gone', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'been', 'working', 'way', 'free', 'society', 'being', 'zombies', 'created', 'ultimate', 'army', 'zombies', 'first', 'rule', 'Fight', 'Club', 'never', 'talk', 'Fight', 'Club', 'yet', 'everywhere', 'everybody', 'Fight', 'Club', 'Tyler', 'Durden', 'just', 'name', 'figment', 'imagination', 'shadowy', 'figure', 'was', 'born', 'only', 'legend', 'Thus', 'Narrator', 'holding', 'hands', 'Marla', 'watching', 'improbable', 'financial', 'collapse', 'America', 'redemption', 'death', 'gone', 'journey', 'escape', 'own', 'personal', 'hell', 'only', 'create', 'one', 'even', 'more', 'personal', 'last', 'even', 'worse', 'own', 'doing', 'can', 'kill', 'Tyler', 'Durden', 'Tyler', 'Durden', 'still', 'been', 'created', 'way', 'dissolve', 'Project', 'Mayhem', 'way', 'stop', 'financial', 'collapse', 'way', 'live', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'Fight', 'Club', 'tale', 'man', 'so', 'numb', 'took', 'punches', 'just', 'feel', 'something', 'wanted', 'rest', 'world', 'be', 'free', 'freedom', 'price', 'price', 'freedom', 'first', 'place.The', 'story', 'well-put', 'together', 'brilliantly', 'written', 'stunningly', 'put-together', 'perfectly', 'acted', 'hilarious', 'memorable', 'most', 'thought-provoking', 'Fight', 'Club', 'quasi-modern', 'masterpiece']",N/A
518726,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00003CWQ2,"""flickjunkie""","[24, 49]","`Fight Club' is a superb filmmaking achievement.  It is brutal, innovative, raw, realistic, and extremely powerful.  You could not ask more from the actors.  Edward Norton once again portrays a psyche in delicate  imbalance with potent and believable intensity.  Brad Pitt moves to the far  side of diabolical and excels in making his character both warped and  charismatic.  Helena Bonham Carter also shines as the Tyler's pathetic and  parasitic girl friend.`Fight Club' takes some of the most pernicious  elements of societal dysfunction and wraps them up into a single  imaginative well crafted and entertaining film.  We have elements of gang  behavior, cultism, anarchy, terrorism and debauchery all glorified in the  name of iconoclasm.  Exciting, seductive and subversive.  How utterly cool  and hip!So now comes the twist.  I hated this film.  It is a monument to  everything that is wrong with filmmaking today.  It is clever and  technically superb but philosophically and socially bereft.  Its attempt at  social satire, while effective and visceral, was destructive and noxious.  I also can't help but notice the extreme irony of using satire against  consumerism as the theme for inducing the masses to buy tickets to consume  your film.At what point does a film cross the line between art and  depravity?  `Fight Club' is a brilliant but dangerous film that begs the  question.  If art is a reflection of a society's culture and values, then  when I look at this film I have to be frightened at what is staring back at  me.  When I reflect on some of the most popular films of the last five  years, I can't help but notice the accelerating celebration of random and  impulsive violence, depravity, decadence, and pure bad taste.  `Fight Club'  has pushed the envelope once again to find a new pinnacle (or should I say  nadir) in the portrayal of these corrosive elements of societal  dissolution.It's comical how many people think it is avant-guard to  attack the establishment, as if this is a concept only recently conceived.  `Fight Club' is just the latest rallying cry to anarchy in a long line of  such cries that have plagued society throughout human history.  It always  seems to be a romantic notion for everyone to be totally free and just live  ""naturally"" (like animals) until one of those animals decides that it is  you whom it might be fun to kill today.  It doesn't seem to occur to those  who extol the sardonic message of such films, that they simultaneously  promote and lionize societal destabilization, and that anarchy and mayhem  are much less fun in real life than when you are watching them in the air  conditioned comfort of your local movie house.  Just ask the kids at  Columbine High School.I like dark movies as much or more than the next  guy, but this film simply goes too far.  There is nothing wrong with  criticizing the establishment.  Constructive criticism is the only way to  bring about progressive change.  But this film is merely vulgar cynicism  that suggests that mayhem is preferable to imperfect culture.  That is  grossly irresponsible.So I am placed in the paradoxical position of  admiring this film while I must condemn it.  As a flickjunkie I must stand  in awe of it as a filmmaking accomplishment.  But as a human being  concerned with the greater good of the species, I must cry out against it.  How far are we willing to go in the name of entertainment?  Are we so  myopic as to demand entertainment at any cost?  I guess we will see when  someone raises the ante and the next shock treatment comes to a theater  near you.",5,Brutal and raw,960595200,"06 10, 2000",2000,3593,"['Fight', 'Club', 'superb', 'filmmaking', 'achievement', 'brutal', 'innovative', 'raw', 'realistic', 'extremely', 'powerful', 'could', 'not', 'ask', 'more', 'actors', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'once', 'again', 'psyche', 'delicate', 'imbalance', 'potent', 'believable', 'intensity', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'far', 'side', 'diabolical', 'excels', 'making', 'character', 'warped', 'charismatic', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'also', 'Tyler', 'pathetic', 'parasitic', 'girl', 'friend.', 'Fight', 'Club', 'most', 'pernicious', 'elements', 'societal', 'dysfunction', 'wraps', 'up', 'single', 'imaginative', 'well', 'crafted', 'entertaining', 'film', 'have', 'elements', 'gang', 'behavior', 'cultism', 'anarchy', 'terrorism', 'debauchery', 'glorified', 'name', 'iconoclasm', 'Exciting', 'seductive', 'subversive', 'How', 'utterly', 'cool', 'hip', 'So', 'now', 'twist', 'hated', 'film', 'monument', 'everything', 'wrong', 'filmmaking', 'today', 'clever', 'technically', 'superb', 'philosophically', 'socially', 'bereft', 'attempt', 'social', 'satire', 'effective', 'visceral', 'was', 'destructive', 'noxious', 'also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'notice', 'extreme', 'irony', 'using', 'satire', 'consumerism', 'theme', 'inducing', 'masses', 'buy', 'tickets', 'consume', 'film.At', 'what', 'point', 'film', 'line', 'art', 'depravity', 'Fight', 'Club', 'brilliant', 'dangerous', 'film', 'question', 'art', 'reflection', 'society', 'culture', 'values', 'then', 'when', 'look', 'film', 'have', 'be', 'frightened', 'what', 'staring', 'back', 'When', 'reflect', 'most', 'popular', 'films', 'last', 'five', 'years', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'notice', 'accelerating', 'celebration', 'random', 'impulsive', 'violence', 'depravity', 'decadence', 'pure', 'bad', 'taste', 'Fight', 'Club', 'pushed', 'envelope', 'once', 'again', 'find', 'new', 'pinnacle', 'should', 'say', 'nadir', 'portrayal', 'corrosive', 'elements', 'societal', 'dissolution.It', 'comical', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'think', 'avant-guard', 'attack', 'establishment', 'concept', 'only', 'recently', 'conceived', 'Fight', 'Club', 'just', 'latest', 'rallying', 'cry', 'anarchy', 'long', 'line', 'such', 'cries', 'have', 'plagued', 'society', 'human', 'history', 'always', 'be', 'romantic', 'notion', 'everyone', 'be', 'totally', 'free', 'just', 'live', 'naturally', 'animals', 'one', 'animals', 'decides', 'whom', 'might', 'be', 'fun', 'kill', 'today', ""n't"", 'seem', 'occur', 'who', 'extol', 'sardonic', 'message', 'such', 'films', 'simultaneously', 'promote', 'lionize', 'societal', 'destabilization', 'anarchy', 'mayhem', 'are', 'much', 'less', 'fun', 'real', 'life', 'when', 'are', 'watching', 'air', 'conditioned', 'comfort', 'local', 'movie', 'house', 'Just', 'ask', 'kids', 'Columbine', 'High', 'School.I', 'dark', 'movies', 'much', 'more', 'next', 'guy', 'film', 'simply', 'too', 'far', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'criticizing', 'establishment', 'Constructive', 'criticism', 'only', 'way', 'bring', 'about', 'progressive', 'change', 'film', 'merely', 'vulgar', 'cynicism', 'mayhem', 'preferable', 'imperfect', 'culture', 'grossly', 'irresponsible.So', 'am', 'placed', 'paradoxical', 'position', 'admiring', 'film', 'must', 'condemn', 'flickjunkie', 'must', 'stand', 'awe', 'filmmaking', 'accomplishment', 'human', 'being', 'concerned', 'greater', 'good', 'species', 'must', 'cry', 'out', 'How', 'far', 'are', 'willing', 'go', 'name', 'entertainment', 'Are', 'so', 'myopic', 'demand', 'entertainment', 'cost', 'guess', 'will', 'see', 'when', 'someone', 'ante', 'next', 'shock', 'treatment', 'theater']",N/A

Its the story of a seemingly ordinary young man who hooks up with the enigmatic Tyler Durden.  Together they start the fight club, a club full of guys who beat the crud out of each other.  Helena Bonham Carter is great in this film because she plays a rather strange and deranged young woman so well.  All three of the actors makes this film so great.  I think Ed Norton is one of the best new actors to hit the screen in years.  His portrayal of this mad character was superb.  It really makes you see another side of life and it makes you see civilization in a way that few films do.  Its violent but done in a way that is just incredible.Some reviewer said watching it was like an acid trip and I agree.

518734,ANWX7804VMEQB,B00003CWQ2,Garber Jackal,"[3, 4]","From the opening sequence traveling through the inner workings of Edward Norton's neural system it's clear that director David Fincher wants to assault your senses with 'Fight Club'. He throws in everything including a few kitchen sinks so that by the end of his film you'll want to take the ride again. He doesn't care that some aspects don't quite make that much sense or that the main character Tyler Durden has a viewpoint that some would call fasscist. He wants you to think about 'Fight Club'...but not until the last (and very vivid) frame is over.Edward Norton plays Jack - a depressed business man stuck in a nine to five job and hating every second of his miserable existance. So much so that he cannot sleep a wink. He stumbles into the world of support groups (namely testicular cancer) and begins to feel better about himself; he is finally able to sleep. That is until a chain-smoking, pill-popper Marla comes in with the same plan of crashing support groups. His lie reflects his lie. After meeting an eccentric soap salesman by the name of Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) the two decide to unleash their aggrevation with the world by beating each other up - and loving it.From the opening scene Fight Club is full of ideas and principles and logic. Half-way through many of those ideas have either meshed together to form something greater or collided with a bang/thud - and still formed something more substantial. By the end of the film we're in chaos. The ideas still make sense but we're so immersed in the story of Jack and Tyler that we can't stop and think about all this logic. This is not a bad thing. In fact, it's a great thing.By the second half of the film you are no longer allowed to have a breath of fresh air. There are no moments of release where you will think that one character is going to be okay. David Fincher hands over the controls to Tyler Durden and we strap ourselves in.Fight Club is brilliant and the critics never gave it the respect it deserved.

Overlong, it lurches unevenly from Tex Avery slapstick to glib superficiality to the inspired, often in one scene. At it's best it resonates the observational rapping of best stand up comedy and it's brilliant sense of humour makes one forgive it's missed opportunities. Anyone recalling the abandoned six army of Germany at Stalingrad will find the absurdity, cruelty and farce of Fascism portrayed here as on the money. However, far from being a contemporary tract, it cheekily re-packages punk for those who missed it the first time while making oldsters nostalgic for their pogo-ing past. The central conceit of the film slyly changing the jobless 'no future' ethos of 77 to the 'no future' because we've got a job whingeing of 99. There's chutzpah for you, but it's still the same old, same old. The dyed spiked hair and anarchist posturings of Tyler Durden recalling you-know-who of the Sex Pistols. Also, the pantheist vision of a weed infested superhighway with people growing vegetables coupled with a socialist manifesto of returning to economic parity recalls the accusation of the time that punks were in fact the new hippies. It's questionable whether any victim of recent downsizing in the go-slow-bust technologies industries will relate to the protaganist's security of tenure and perks anyway, it's something of a chimera on Palahniuk's part. He has gone on to write further preposterous novels to mixed reviews and some disillusionment over his one trick pony-ism. That's probably why Fight Club, although superlative and engaging because it is hard to catogorise, doesn't stand up to too many repeat viewings. It suffers the same affliction as punk, that is, beyond the initial expression of frustration and anger there isn't a lot to say.

It really is a smart film, with tons of decent dialogue and a truly knock-you-off-your-feet ending, which you will have the hardest time guessing.But the best thing about the film is the two lead performances.

All three?There are many dialectical strains in fight club; feminism versus Green anti-consumerism, passive ""metrosexuality"" versus troglodyte violence, an almost Luddite repudiation of modern life versus the use of Mind Control strategies to build a ""movement"". Plus a very confused view of self improvement.Moderation, self awareness, goal seeking, focus, and adopting healthy male models of behavior?  Breaking free of malignant anti-male feminism while embracing the good of the feminist movement that emphasizes that women are not property?  No.In a sense you laugh along, in another you wonder who they're really making fun of here.Ironies abound as well, a Doctor who refuses to prescribe sleep medication and instead prescribes ""exercise and valerian root"", to black humor about automobile accidents to the female antagonist's dissolution that seems to parallel the main character's search for himself.  Not to mention what Tyler does to the Clam Chowder or what he splices into family movies.One should not take this movie too seriously.

The mood was right. We were all alone for the whole night (The first time a bunch of us had had a sleepover without the unnessacery disadvantage of parents) and although it was a Sunday our minds were at ease since it was a holiday the next day and no school would follow. I swear by this film, the two hours and fifteen minutes before it began, I was to some extent a different person.I'm sure that it had lessons that were just around the corner for me anyway, but this just happened to be the way that I discovered them. (I was only 14).This film is not for stupid people. Although I'm sure that there is a hint of vanity in that comment I still mean every bit of it. If your into brand names and conformity then this film will do one of two things. Insult you beyond your wildest dreams to the extent were you will stop watching it and go around telling everyone what a crappy film it is (that makes you a stupid person) or it will open your eyes and make you think differently about life and opportunities all together.Don't get me wrong, It is possible that the film just won't do it for you. You may say it's stating the obvious, the point that it's trying to make is too vague and is not put across properly with a bunch of guys beating on each other night after night. And thats perfectly fine. If you didnt like it then you didnt like it. Just don't start telling people that it's crap when you know full well that it's not.Anyway, maybe I'm going a little over over the top with the whole life changing experience thing, but if you havent seen it then there's only one way to find out whether I am or not.I saw it for the twentieth time recently (Sad I know but that is during a period of over three years) and I'm still noticing new things. For example when Tyler checks his teeth after throwing Jack through the rearview mirror, that represents how thoughts such as vanity are slowly creeping back into him. No matter how far you go you will always come back to your old roots eventually. (There that's for all you people who say that it portrays nothing but that we should all give up on life and call it a day.)Like in so many of these reviews I'm beginning to ramble, so I'll finish by saying that if you havent seen it yet then do yourself a favour and get hold of it.And if it doesn't get you within the first five minutes, then you might as well turn it off.",5,Losing all hope was freedom!,1079395200,"03 16, 2004",2004,2525,"['best', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'Well', 'probobaly', 'not', 'definetely', 'one', 'them.I', 'saw', 'film', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'friends', 'wide', 'screen', 'T.V', 'mood', 'was', 'right', 'were', 'alone', 'whole', 'night', 'first', 'time', 'bunch', 'had', 'had', 'sleepover', 'unnessacery', 'disadvantage', 'parents', 'was', 'Sunday', 'minds', 'were', 'ease', 'was', 'holiday', 'next', 'day', 'school', 'would', 'follow', 'swear', 'film', 'two', 'hours', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'began', 'was', 'extent', 'different', 'person.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'had', 'lessons', 'were', 'just', 'corner', 'anyway', 'just', 'happened', 'be', 'way', 'discovered', 'was', 'only', '14', '.This', 'film', 'not', 'stupid', 'people', ""'m"", 'sure', 'hint', 'vanity', 'comment', 'still', 'mean', 'bit', 'brand', 'names', 'conformity', 'then', 'film', 'will', 'do', 'one', 'two', 'things', 'Insult', 'wildest', 'dreams', 'extent', 'were', 'will', 'stop', 'watching', 'go', 'around', 'telling', 'everyone', 'what', 'crappy', 'film', 'stupid', 'person', 'will', 'open', 'eyes', 'make', 'think', 'differently', 'life', 'opportunities', 'together.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'possible', 'film', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'may', 'say', 'stating', 'obvious', 'point', 'trying', 'make', 'too', 'vague', 'not', 'put', 'properly', 'bunch', 'guys', 'beating', 'other', 'night', 'night', 'perfectly', 'fine', 'didnt', 'then', 'didnt', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'start', 'telling', 'people', 'crap', 'when', 'know', 'full', 'well', 'not.Anyway', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'going', 'little', 'top', 'whole', 'life', 'changing', 'experience', 'thing', 'havent', 'seen', 'then', 'only', 'one', 'way', 'find', 'out', 'am', 'not.I', 'saw', 'twentieth', 'time', 'recently', 'Sad', 'know', 'period', 'three', 'years', ""'m"", 'still', 'noticing', 'new', 'things', 'example', 'when', 'Tyler', 'teeth', 'throwing', 'Jack', 'rearview', 'mirror', 'how', 'thoughts', 'such', 'vanity', 'are', 'slowly', 'creeping', 'back', 'matter', 'how', 'far', 'go', 'will', 'always', 'come', 'back', 'old', 'roots', 'eventually', 'people', 'who', 'say', 'nothing', 'should', 'give', 'up', 'life', 'call', 'day', 'so', 'many', 'reviews', ""'m"", 'beginning', 'ramble', ""'ll"", 'finish', 'saying', 'havent', 'seen', 'yet', 'then', 'do', 'favour', 'get', 'hold', 'it.And', ""n't"", 'get', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'then', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'turn', 'off']",N/A

The society in which we live is very materialistic and we areraised believing that material possessions are essential to our survival and ourhappiness. Fight Club shows us the life of a man that lived exactly to this guideline for a perfect life and was unhappy and unable to feel anything as a result.He tried going to groups but that didn't last. His ended up with a new form oftherapy that he and his ""friend ""created. Fight Clubs became the escape ofthose who were lost in the desolate lives they were living. This was carriedeven farther developing into a terrorist organization bent on ""setting peoplefree."" There is a major plot twist u have to see to believe.Although there is a lot of violence in Fight Club, the message is that of nonviolence. We are shown the extreme of living a materialistic life and we areshown the extreme of living the anarchist life.  It is clear that despite thephilosophy that ""Tyler"" has taught the narrator, he quickly becomes a fascistleader running a terrorist organization. We are shown the destructiveness ofboth extremes. The message that the movie the author and the director aretrying to get across is not to follow leaders of any kind. Don't be a ""spacemonkey."" The narrator attempts to undo what Tyler had done. He figures outthat Tyler was wrong too, as was society and that he was going to have totake responsibility for what he had done. In order to be happy he would haveto live on his own and go his own direction.Although there are profound messages in Fight Club, it is clear that we arenot supposed to take it too seriously. There is an element of humor that isundeniable. From Bob, to the narrator beating himselfsenseless, we are brought from the grotesque violence to the hilariousnessof situations. Tyler the projectionist splicing single frames of porn into familyfilms, the guerrilla terrorist of the food service industry, and saying things like""sticking feathers up your butt does not make you a chicken.""

518749,A15XNT79BMHKXN,B00003CWQ2,"googleit ""movie buff""","[10, 17]","First let me say that the opening few minutes of this movie blew me away - the opening credit sequence alone is almost reason enough to rent this movie.  And David Fincher definitely creates some of the most striking visual images you'll see on film. (But, as he proved in Alien 3, visual style alone doesn't make a good movie).  I especially liked when Norton was walking through the Ikea catalog that was his apartment.  Norton, Bonham-Carter, and especially Pitt give powerful perfomances.However, I found that this film amounted to less than the sum of its parts.  Get past all the violence, and the anti-consumer philosophy, and this movie is basically a satirical comedy about a depressed guy who's losing it.  And it's not very funny or entertaining.  None of the &quot;philosophical&quot; stuff in this movie is anything new, nor is it especially profound.  The idea of a programmed, white-collar drone who walks half-asleep through life has been addressed hundreds of times before, all the way back to &quot;Metropolis&quot; (or hell, even &quot;Joe vs. the Volcano&quot;).The messages are clear and not really very thought-provoking:  consumerism, advertising, and big business bad.  The comforts of modern society prevent us from feeling truly alive.  We become owned by the things we own.  Man has been turned into a self-help parody of himself by all the so-called &quot;men's movements&quot; that only aim to make man a more feminine version of himself.  Is any of this stuff really that deep or thought-provoking?  Have any of us not thought about this stuff until &quot;The Fight Club&quot;?The bottom line is that this movie is trying to be more than it is - had it focused on being simply a dark comedy, maybe it would have worked.  Instead, it tries so hard to be hip and subversive that it simply doesn't end up being very entertaining. Maybe this movie will appeal to angry young people who are fed up with &quot;the system&quot;.

Edward Norton is completely believable as your ordinary everyman who longs for something more than his cookie-cutter life. Brad Pitt delivers his usual strong performance, full of swagger and bravado, as the man who can (and will) change everything. This movie is not so much about fighting (though of course there's quite a bit of that) as it is about escapism, being someone you aren't or have always wanted to be. And believe me, in this film it's true - talk about a surprise ending! You won't see it coming, trust me. And DVD is truly the best way to appreciate this film. The four audio commentaries provide depth and detail - I recommend listening to the one featuring the director (David Fincher) and the principal actors (Norton, Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter). It's hilarious and makes you appreciate a lot of the subtleties of the film (and why Edward Norton dislikes those new VW Beetles). Disc 2 adds deleted scenes and alternate takes (with immediate comparison to the actual takes and notes explaining the choice), promotional materials (theatrical trailers, TV spots, even the mock PSAs done by Norton and Pitt), and some amazing &quot;making of&quot; footage with multiple-angle options. This one is a great addition to any DVD collection.

518754,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,B00003CWQ2,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[6, 8]","I saw this in the theater, and I thought it was brilliant.  I got it right away.  I didn't like the last third of the film (the ""twist"" didn't really work for me), but the first 2/3rds of the film is amongst the best filmmaking I saw during the 90's (not a great decade for films).  Most critics were shocked by this film, saying it was inciting violence.  Roger Ebert, who has given thumbs up to such crap as Speed 2, Die Hard 3, and Con Air, and almost gave thumbs up to Gigli, disliked this film intensely, calling this a ""fascist"" film, which it totally isn't.  This is a film about the hollow lives of men during the ""booming"" 1990's, except this film really looks at them with a sharp wit and real, hilarious satire.  This is great satire, dripping with sarcasm and real irony, not the Gen X ""irony"" that permeated the decade.  The film also came out in 1999, the best year for films in that decade.  Pitt and Norton are superb in their roles, and Fincher's direction is very self assured.  Fincher is one of the more interesting and talented directors working today.  While he's not perfect (Panic Room and The Game were disappointing), Seven and Fight Club are masterpieces.  Harry Knowles was one of the few film critics to really get this film, saying ""it forces you to have dangerous thoughts, confront them as you would any problem before you and expects you as a reasonable human being to come out with the right answers"".  The film is not a simplistic, nihilisitic, punk type of film that says ""go out and destroy stuff"".  There is real brains behind this film (and its source material, the brilliant novel by Chuck Palahniuk), and there is depth here that was missing in the 1990's.  In many ways, the film exposes the slacker, BS Gen X aesthetic and shows how hollow that lifestyle is.  While it isn't perfect, the film's negatives are small compared to the huge positives it has.

Although the movie started very promisingly, I felt the violence and machismo was gratuitous and nauseating, and the end made very little sense. When it came out to rent, though, something made me give it a second chance, and I watched the DVD. Simply based on the first half-hour of Fincher's commentary (all I had time for before it was due back) I bought it, and now it is my new favorite movie!The four commentaries are simply amazing, peeling back the layers of the movie like a big onion, revealing hundreds of beautiful little touches that are easily missed in a casual viewing. The solo Fincher track is engaging in its own right, but when you add Norton, Pitt, and Bonham-Carter it really provides a well-rounded view of the relationship of the characters. The extras (on their own separate disc) are equally fascinating, covering special effects and CGI that appear so seamless I didn't even realize they WERE special effects. Even the packaging of the disc is entertaining, with the inclusion of mostly negative reviews of the film (not a very orthodox marketing ploy, yet very in keeping with the spirit of the film.)This disc is a must-have for any fans of the film, and even non-fans should rent it and get a whole new perspective on the movie.

518757,A25FDX17O3QKLT,B00003CWQ2,Hallstatt Prince,"[9, 12]","Fight Club is one of the best movies made in the past five years if not the best.It is funny how when one's world view changes so does the perceptions of a work of art. And make no mistake this is a work of art. - high art.So I write this review in three parts, pre 9-11 (when I first saw it), immediately post 9-11 and my present reflections on the movies message.Fight Club was based on the short first novel of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk. Although the movie and the book are somewhat different some of the best lines in the movie come from the book. I think if you like the movie you will like the book and if you like the book you will like the movie.The movie met with mixed reviews, highly mixed reviews, and I am afraid not enough people (especially the right people) saw the movie. For that reason I will try not to give away too much about the relationship between the two main characters ""Jack"" and Tyler Durden.Parts of the film are violent but the  violence is not gratuitous. It is a movie for people who like to think and be challenged and entertained.This was a movie that was made with love as David Fincher has filled it with all sorts of visual details. The music by The Dust Brothers is exceptional and the lyric of the last song of the movie is very much in line with Buddhist teaching.The movie is part meditation, part social commentary, part action movie , part comedy (a strange mixture of the varieties of black and light comfortably coexisting,) part love story and from my perspective  a very hopeful film. I see the movie as being great art that is open to numerous interpretations. In a way it is somewhat of a cinematographic Rorschach test.The movie begins with the introduction of a character who is sometimes referred to as ""Jack"" (played by Edward Norton). Jack is clean cut buttoned down insomniac who works a boring job while accumulating trendy possessions (Fincher's special effects of bringing the Ikea catalogue to life is one of the things that brings a clever visual humor to this edgy comedy). Jack's insomnia is driving him over the brink while he continues to travel across the country from one city to another as a recall coordinator investigating (sometimes horrific) car accidents. After trying to obtain sedatives from a doctor the wisecracking physician instead recommends that Jack visit a cancer support group to understand what real pain is all about. This is our first inkling that ""Jack"" is on a spiritual journey. Jack not only gets comfort from participating in the support group (even though he is as healthy as a proverbial horse) he becomes addicted to support groups. In one he learns how to let loose and cry at another he participates in guided meditation. However his support groups are invaded by another healthy poser, Marla Singer (a role played to the hilt by Helena Bonham Carter). Marla's problems are slightly different from Jack's. She is a bored unemployed nihilist. The banter between Jack and Marla is priceless.On one of Jack's business trips he happens to meet Tyler Durden. Tyler is cool: he talks cool, he dresses cool and is probably everything poor clean cut Jack wished he was. They exchange business cards. But after returning from this particular flight Jack finds out that his condominium and all of his possession have been destroyed by fire. Not having anywhere else to turn he calls Tyler. They go out to a bar  and have a few drinks where Tyler begins to explain his offbeat and anarchistic philosophy of life. After leaving the bar at the request of Tyler they engage in a fight that both finds cathartic. Jack having no where else to go returns with Tyler to his dilapidated home. Together they form something called Fight Club an organization where individuals gather for bare knuckle brawls to not only take out their frustrations but reclaim a sense of being alive.A triangle forms between Jack, Tyler and Marlabut it is as much of a philosophical triangle as it is a love triangle.However Tyler's plans do not stop there, he has a larger vision of changing the world.Rather than Tyler coming across as a megalomanic he seems to symbolize the power of one individual in possession of a unique idea with the will to carry it out.---------Immediately after 9-11 this movie was hard to look at. Although in Fight Club through all of the mayhem, violence and vandalism only one person is killed in the movie but it also featured scenes of mass destruction. But I was not able to dismiss the movie after the events of 9-11 - it caused me to reflect more on the movie. Real art does this.What was the difference from the crazed terrorists that attacked America on 9-11 and Tyler Durden and his army of misfits who caused mass destruction that in the last frames of the movie looked eerily familiar to the attack on the WTC? Well for one thing I saw the destruction of physical structures as being symbolic for a fighting back of individuals who suffered a violence of the soulfrom the banality of modern culture. Further in this imaginary world of Fight Club things were destroyed but no one (except one of the Fight Club members) gets hurt. Finally it was the story of an entire generation of Americans rising up against hypocrisy - a far cry from a group of foreign invaders killing thousands of Americans and forcing their will on us. Still the scene of collapsing skyscrapers in NYCunfortunately takes on a whole new meaning in this post 9-11 world.--------Fight Club ReduxWhen you have a movie where grown men are beating the pulp  out of each other and sky scrapers collapse but  no one gets seriously hurt the violence cannot be taken seriously. So I see the violence being more of a symbol. Rather that Tyler being a Fascist like the vicious Islamo-terorrists that attacked us on 9-11 he is as American as apple pie. He is a man who against the odds helps to lead his generation out of the banality of their lives and restore the American dream. Tyler is a visionary and an idealist. He is not  a fascist who wants to imprison but an everyman who desires to liberate. In the end it is a hopeful movie.--------The movie is rated R and I agree with that rating if it is applied the way it is stated - no one under 17 unless accompanied by an adult. Ideally what is meant by that rating is that the said adult is  more than just a warm body that is over 21. The movie is violent but violence is not the point of the movie. So I guess I recommend the movie to thinking adolescents, adolescents accompanied by adults that possess a conscious and are able to communicate with a minor and of course adults themselves that are not psychopaths.  If you can't differentiate between reality and a movie don't see this movie.When I was a kid my friends and I were Three Stooges fans and we couldn't figure out why when you poked someone in the eye you wouldn't get that plunck of a violin string sound effect. If you still can't figure that out don't watch this movie. I am not sure if many will take this advice seriously in these days when children can graphically dismember the very real looking image of a human being in a video game. It's not for kids.A movie well worth seeing and owning.One more note.One of the nice things about owning the CD is being able to slow down the movie to see the subliminal frames placed in the film. Subliminal messages in movies is just another of the complex twists in this hilariously intelligent movie.

518758,A3B08DCVOC1BDI,B00003CWQ2,"""halo1000""","[14, 16]","(you'll get the title after you see the movie) OK, first off, Fight Club isn't really about the fighting. That's not the focus of the movie. What it's really about is two guys who devise a plan to f**k up the system - support groups, gigantic corporations, purchasing things we don't need, celebrity status, etc.  Basically, the narrator (Edward Norton, whose character's name isn't given) is an insomniac with a fix for Swedish furniture. He's a businessman who's frequent traveling drives him insane. He goes to support groups for cancer, AIDS, etc. despite the fact that he has no disease. He then meets Tyler Durden, a soap salesman. When the narrator's condo is blown up, he goes to live with Tyler, who basically has a grunge against current society, and the fight club spins out of control from there, and eventually evolves into something called Project Mayhem...The DVD's great. It's ironic, that, despite the subject of the movie, the second disc has just about every piece of promotional material that you could ever want or care to see. My favorites are of Brad Pitt and Edward Norton giving public service announcements. The first disc, in addition to the movie, has four commentary tracks, the most interesting being the one between Fincher, Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, and Helena Bonham Carter (it also explains why they had to beat up a Volkswagen Beetle...). There's some interesting deleted and alternate scenes, including one line Marla says that was quickly cut out, but after one viewing, you won't be surprised that these were cut out. There's also some stuff about how they made that house that you'll want to see afterwards.",5,I am Jack's movie review,978825600,"01 7, 2001",2001,1646,"[""'ll"", 'get', 'title', 'see', 'movie', 'OK', 'first', 'Fight', 'Club', ""n't"", 'really', 'fighting', 'not', 'focus', 'movie', 'What', 'really', 'about', 'two', 'guys', 'who', 'devise', 'plan', 'f**k', 'up', 'system', 'support', 'groups', 'gigantic', 'corporations', 'purchasing', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'celebrity', 'status', 'etc', 'Basically', 'narrator', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'character', 'name', ""n't"", 'given', 'insomniac', 'fix', 'Swedish', 'furniture', 'businessman', 'who', 'frequent', 'traveling', 'drives', 'insane', 'support', 'groups', 'cancer', 'AIDS', 'etc', 'fact', 'disease', 'then', 'Tyler', 'Durden', 'soap', 'salesman', 'When', 'narrator', 'condo', 'blown', 'up', 'live', 'Tyler', 'who', 'basically', 'grunge', 'current', 'society', 'fight', 'club', 'control', 'there', 'eventually', 'something', 'called', 'Project', 'Mayhem', 'DVD', 'great', 'ironic', 'subject', 'movie', 'second', 'disc', 'just', 'about', 'piece', 'promotional', 'material', 'could', 'ever', 'want', 'care', 'see', 'favorites', 'are', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'giving', 'public', 'service', 'announcements', 'first', 'disc', 'addition', 'movie', 'four', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'most', 'interesting', 'being', 'one', 'Fincher', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'also', 'why', 'had', 'beat', 'up', 'Volkswagen', 'Beetle', 'interesting', 'deleted', 'alternate', 'scenes', 'including', 'one', 'line', 'Marla', 'was', 'quickly', 'cut', 'out', 'one', 'viewing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'were', 'cut', 'out', 'also', 'stuff', 'how', 'made', 'house', ""'ll"", 'want', 'see', 'afterwards']",N/A
518759,AYF76HQ10BL2J,B00003CWQ2,Hamster Army,"[1, 1]","Fight Club, based on Chuck Palahniuk's novel, is an excellent adaption of his book. There are so many themes, feelings and human sensitivities touched upon it can be a bit overwhelming at first, making it a good film to watch more than once.The violence during the fight scenes were brutal at times and fairly disturbing. But it almost seemed necessary in order to immerse a person into the emotional state it put the character's in. Yet I can see where some of the younger, macho crowd might think it's ""cool, dude"" and associate the film's title with the fight scenes alone, making it worth their while...unfortunately.Ultimately Fight Club grows on you and creates sympathy for the characters in the film, moving you to cheer them on inside. Pitt and Norton were great choices for the cast leads.It's an interesting and thought provoking story, something you don't see much in film today honestly. It questions our values, family structures, religions, and touches our inner-demons.Death is a major part of the story, dealing with it, accepting it, and of course the waiters, clerks, cubicle slaves, security guards, beat cops and other servants of the rich find some meaning in life, something to look forward to and be proud of, outside of their dull, redundant, consuming, sitcom-watching lives, in a most bizarre fashion.The film has a little of everything; comedy, tragedy, drama, and suspense. If you are going to watch a film made in the last 3 years, watch Fight Club, highly recommended.

Ed Norton is perfect as a suit and tie guy who just gets sick of his mindless consumerism. He meets Tyler, played to perfection by Brad Pitt, who inspires him to take his life into his own hands and they begin exorcizing their own demons through cathartic underground fight clubs. Soon, they spawn a revolution...from there the movie begings its mind-play with the viewer. Freedom, loyalty, courage, anarchy, obsessiveness...all are explored here in their most extreme forms.

518771,A1KLNYFROE90OV,B00003CWQ2,Howard Tuttleman... howardtuttleman@howardtut...,"[0, 0]","My friend Lyle reccomended this movie to me one day during a conversation about big corporations like Starrbucks, and mass consumerism or something. He figured that this movie would somehow make me think more about that type of thing. So when it came down to it at the video store I had ""The Fight Club"" in one hand and ""Bad Boys 2"" in the other. I REALLY wanted to see Bad Boys 2 again, but as not to hurt Lyle's feelings I opted for ""The Fight Club"".Now judging by the name I figured it was something I could really sink my teeth into, considering how much I LOVE action in movies. Boy, was I only half right.It started out with confusing talking parts and didn't seem to go anywhere or make any sense. But man, when they made their Fight Club I suddenly tuned right in! He was like ""Punch me as hard as you can"" BAM! Right in the ear! Then they got more fighters and it was an all out brawl! As you can probably tell, these fight scenes were by far my favorite parts in the movie. However, there were far too many boring talking parts that were WAY over your average viewers head (even mine).So there I was, completely inspired to go out and make some action of my own, so I tried to start my own fight club, which I now kind of regret. I asked Lyle to be the honorary second member which he politely declined, so I called him a chicken, and where I come from that is NOT something you take lightly. But he ignored me anyways. I decided to make Morris my first member to fight. We just started out wrestling on the grass after I told him the rules, but I quickly stopped the fight when he tried to bite me, and it's just not fair to punch at a dog. I couldn't really blame him because dogs aren't that smart. I got frustrated so I took a direct cue from the movie and blasted our paperboy with the hose so he would fight me, but he ended up falling off his bike which somehow hurt his foot of all things. I decided it wouldn't have been a fair fight anyways. Anyways, my mom came out and started yelling at me. I told her I wasnt' allowed to talk about Fight Club, and she got really angry. When she finally went inside the house, I fought the mailbox. Then I went out back and fought her tomato garden. That was pretty much the end of the Fight Club because I got grounded shortly after this.Anyways, if I were you I would only get this DVD to fast forward to all the great fighting, skip all of the long talking parts, and all parts with the girl because they will bore you to death. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that Tom Arnold is also in the movie, but he has a really big deformed chest. Whatever.In conclusion I guess I can't say I'm too proud to have tried to organize a fight club back then. I'm a couple years older now, and I guess I don't really want to fight people for real anymore. The people that make these movies may not realize it, but it can really get people like us worked up if they are trying to tell us that being in a violence gang is the way to live your life. Now, when my mom or dad or anyone else makes me mad, my new non-violent solution is to simply play my harmonica at them until my face turns red.

518782,ANI00381ZIMEW,B00003CWQ2,Jacob G Corbin,"[2, 3]","For a long time after seeing it, I found it difficult to put together a coherent opinion of FIGHT CLUB.  It so completely defied my every expectation that the collision between my preconceptions and what was actually there was catastrophic.  I could only blubber: ""gol-dang, that there moving picture shore was sumthin'.""Edward Norton, who's been a favorite of mine ever since the classic AMERICAN HISTORY X, stars as the nameless ""Narrator"" of the film, which is based - for the most part, faithfully - on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk.  His character is an anonymous Gen-X office drone who works as a recall coordinator for a major car manufacturer.  ""Which car manufacturer?"" asks a woman sitting next to him on a plane.  ""A *major* car manufacturer,"" he reassures her.  This generic-ness is deliberate: many important characters go unnamed or misnamed, and the city most of the film takes place in is, like the city in SEVEN, completely unrecognizable.  But like the city in SEVEN, the environs play a crucial role in setting the tone - where every building in SEVEN was weathered, rain-soaked, and Gothic, Fight Club's burg is full of giant glass-and-steel towers, yuppified apartment complexes, light, and motion.  With a few plot-crucial exceptions, nothing looks more than ten years old; it's a town without a past.Norton, our hero, suffers from severe insomnia.  His job is wearing him thin and he's trying to find solace in Ikea catalogs.  (One memorable shot shows his empty apartment gradually being filled with designer furniture, complete with catalog-style photography and text descriptions.)  His doctor flippantly advises him to check out the testicular cancer survivors' support group - ""now those are some guys with real problems.""  Norton goes, and in short order finds his head being clung to the overdeveloped chest of a sobbing, massively overweight survivor named Bob (played by Meat Loaf, woohoo!).  Then Norton opens up about his own, totally fraudulent, pain.  The experience proves so cathartic that the narrator's insomnia is temporarily cured.  Addicted to the experience, he begins to attend more groups (using a different name at each one)...which works fine, until he discovers Marla (Helena Bonham Carter) another voyeur like himself.  (He's clued in by her appearance at the testicular cancer group.) Knowing that there's another faker ruins it for him, and his insomnia returns with a vengeance.Then, one night on a plane, he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), the charismatic owner and sole employee of the Paper Street Soap Company.  Tyler, who offers trenchant criticisms of capitalism and corporate society, seems like a charming flake, until the narrator gets home to find his apartment a blasted ruin.  Needing a place to stay, he calls Tyler, and the two of them begin to form a special bond, culminating in a bloody fistfight outside a local bar.  Exhilarated by the atavistic thrill of hand-to-hand combat, the two men agree to meet each week for another bout.  Pretty soon other patrons start getting in on the action; after a month, they found Fight Club, an organization dedicated to liberating men from their day-to-day drudgery by allowing them a chance to beat the snot out of one another.As Fight Club grows, Tyler becomes more and more messianic, organizing increasingly bold raids on what he sees as the symbols of an oppressive modern existence: running magnets over the tapes at Blockbuster, blowing up computers, and stealing human fat from a liposuction clinic to make bars of soap to sell to classy department stores.  At first the newly liberated narrator follows Tyler enthusiastically, but his doubts increase as Fight Club expands exponentially, becoming a nationwide underground movement trying to undermine every aspect of society.  New inductees are stripped of their identities and given shaved heads, black muscle shirts, and jackboots.  The fascistic overtones of this revolution, and his mounting jealousy of Tyler's marathon sex bouts with Marla, pushes Norton's character further and further to the periphery of his own creation, until he decides he wants to cut Tyler back down to size.FIGHT CLUB has a new and unique energy to it, galvanized by Fincher's energetic photography and the throbbing music of the Dust Brothers.  But what I really loved about this movie is the way it turns the tables on the Tyler Durdens and Gen-X whiners of this world.  While being brutally honest, and funny, about the bleak realities of corporate life, this criticism is balmy and mild compared to the savaging the movie gives to self-appointed malcontents.  Instead of liberating its members, the Fight Club simply offers a different kind of slavery, one that doesn't end with the five o'clock bell - ""conformity in nonconformity.""  But this message is still delivered with wonderful, wonderful humor.  In its own way, FIGHT CLUB was the best comedy of 1999.Unfortunately, I have to dock this DVD set a star because of Fox's unfathomable decision to release this stripped-down version.  The original FIGHT CLUB DVD set was a groundbreaking accomplishment that set the stage for any number of memorable, high-quality releases later on.  But not only has Fox chosen to undermine that standard, they've made the original nigh-impossible to obtain.  It's a terrible shame, and one that I hope will eventually be rectified.",4,A classic undermined by a sub-par DVD release,1046649600,"03 3, 2003",2003,5372,"['long', 'time', 'seeing', 'found',

518784,A1JV3OZZVLHW85,B00003CWQ2,Jaime Rafael Vazquez,"[1, 1]","When I saw this movie for the first time on televison I was saddend that I didn't catch it in theaters when it was out.  It's an intelligent movie and it's not just about a bunch of guys wailing on each other just for the sake of fighting.  It's got a great director, great cast, great acting and a great storyline.  As soon as the dvd hit the shelves I went out and got my copy.  The plot of this movie is easy to understand (for most people) but hard to put into only 1000 words and I know my review will not do the film justice but I will try my best.Edward Nortons character ""Jack"" works for a major car company writing up reports about car accidents (that might have been caused by the manufacturer he works for) so his boss's can decide if a recall is needed on the automobile.  If the recall is more expensive then paying off the soon-to-be victims families, they don't do one.  He lives a dull, mundane life (like many of us) at his 9 to 5 cubicle and middle class apartment.He suffers from insomnia and asks his doctor for anything that well help him, claiming he is in pain.  The doctor suggest that if Jack wants to see people in pain he should go to a support group for men dealing with testicular cancer.  Jack goes to the meetings pretending he's sick and in them finds freedom and starts to cry, for him losing all hope was freedom.  Now that Jack can cry, Jack can sleep.  He goes to his testicular cancer mettings and on the way he drops by tuberculosis meetings, blood parasite meetings, sickle cell, lymphoma, bowel cancer, and so on and so forth.  This is his vacation, this is his addiction.Then one day at his testicular cancer meeting he sees Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), and she ruins it for him.  He's seen her at his other meetings knowing that she suffers from nothing, (same as him) and he can't cry if there is another faker around.  He can't cry so there fore he can't sleep, so he confronts her.  They tell one another they'll expose each other as frauds and then decide to split up the meetings.On one of Jacks flights back from an accident he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt).  He and Tyler talk about work, the exit procedure on the plane and how to make napalm from gasoline and orange juice concentrate (is it possible, I doubt it).  Tyler makes and sells soap for a living and gives Jack his business card.  Jack and Tyler part ways, then when Jack gets back to his apartment he notices something different about it, its been blown up.  He doesn't know why but he calls Tyler.They meet at a bar and after a few pitchers of beer Jack apprehensivly asks Tyler if he could stay with him.  Tyler says yes on one condition, he wants Jack to hit him as hard as he can.  This is were we get to know more about Tyler Durden.  As Tyler and Jack fight, they also bond.  Jack moves in with Tyler and they live together in a dilapidated house in the warehouse district of town.  Every weekend they go to the parking lot of the bar and they fight while on-lookers either join in or watch.  And that's how Fight Club is born.They move the club to the basement of the bar and that's were they have their weekly fights.  The group gets bigger every week as more people join.  Tyler gives his weekly sermon about our life and our jobs.  How we were thought to believe growing up that one day we would be rich and famous and happy.  How were a generation of men raised by women.  That ""our fathers were our models for god, if our fathers bailed what does that tell you about god? You have to consider the possibility that god does not like you, he never wanted you, in all probability he hates you"".Fight Club gets bigger and Tyler gets an army.  Tyler is nihilistic and he sends his army to run some errands, from blowing up computer stores to destroying corperate art and coffe chaines to bashing in the new VW Bug.  He is also sleeping with Marla after saving her from commiting suicide.  Jack hates Marla so he's not to happy about that.Tyler has changed Fight Club to Project: Mayhem.  There mission is basicly to destroy corperate america.  Jack had been left out of Project: Mayhem but by the time he finds out about their plans, Tyler has disppeared.  Jack travles around the country looking for Tyler knowing were to go only by the ticket stubs he left behind.  Tylers been busy creating Fight Clubs around the country.  When Jack finally catchs up with him, he is shocked to find out the truth behind everthing.Now there were a few things I left out like Bob (played by Meatloaf) or who blew up Jacks place but you'll find out about all that when you see the movie.  I suggest if your not to religous or don't mind violence then go out and get the 2-disc dvd.  The movie is no more or less violent then ""Rocky"", ""Braveheart"", ""The Matrix"" or any other movie with violence in it out there.  The 2-disc has more features and commentaries from almost everyone involved including the writer of the book Chuck Palahniuk.And for those who said the ending reminded them about what happened in NYC, you have to remember that this movie was made in 1999, two years before.  They tried to make the vans under the buildings into .... rent-a-car vans to remind people of what happened to the TWC in '92 but the people at .....wouldn't give the ok. They thought it was in bad taste.",5,Let me tell you about Tyler Durden... he had a plan.,1063670400,"09 16, 2003",2003,5304,"['When', 'saw', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'televison', 'was', 'saddend',

518786,A1GBMGSDDG7BFL,B00003CWQ2,James Crouch,"[2, 2]","I've often heard Fight Club referred to as &quot;The first movie of the new millenium.&quot; When I first heard this, I didn't know quite what to think, but as time went on, I understood it perfectly. Fight Club sets a new standard for ambitious and dark modern filmmaking. Edward Norton plays the unnamed protagonist, a man caught in the mind-numbing grind of everday life. He has become entrenched in a rut of mindless routine, and can do nothing to free himself. He develops extreme insomnia, and can only cure it by going to all sorts of support groups under false pretenses. Previously, he found meaning in the pursuit of material goods, particularly expensive designer furniture. After his apartment is utterly destroyed, he experiences an extreme crisis of faith. It is then that he calls upon Tyler Durden (Played brilliantly by Brad Pitt), a slippery (no pun intended) soap salesman that he met by chance on an airplane flight earlier in the evening that his apartment was destroyed. Tyler is everything our protagonist is not. He makes a living by rebelling against the system, with absolutely no fear for the consequences of his actions. He makes his soap from human fat cells discarded by liposuction clinics, and then sells it back to the very same people at a very high price. Tyler's sole purpose is to be a crick in society's neck. He splices pornographic images into children's films, as well as spicing up the soup at various country clubs. Helena Bohnam-Carter plays trashy Marla Singer,who invades our protagonists world by going to the same support groups that he does, under the same conditions. After their meeting Tyler and Norton's character find that enjoy fighting for the sheer fun of it. They create a Fight Club, which grows in size every day. Eventually Fight Clubs spring up all over the country. They begin to do more than fighting, as Tyler's power grows ever stronger. The group becomes somewhat of a terrorist unit, defacing buildings and artwork rather than killing people. As this continues, Tyler gains an almost god-like reputation, as the chaos spins further and further out of control.  Fight Club is truly one of the most creative (as well as shocking) motion picture experiences ever created. It paints a bleak picture of modern existence, but does it so creatively that you can't help but like what you see. Edward Norton, who is definitely one of my favorite actors, has never been one to shy away from bold and contraversial roles, and this movie is no exception. Brad Pitt plays the brash and cocky Tyler Durden to perfection, and really helps to enhance the overall feeling of the movie. This movie explores human existence, as well as the human mind, on an entirely new level. This movie is a perfect statement for the so called &quot;lost generation&quot; of people that comprise Generation X. This movie forces you to examine your views on life, and if nothing else is a powerful statement of cutting-edge modern filmmaking. Fight Club is rife with action, suspense, and a wonderfully sardonic sense of humor. Fight Club demands the viewer's full attention from beginning to end, and leaves them spellbound, to sit back and think about what they just saw. Fight Club is not for the weak of heart, it is for those who want a movie that will completely blow them away. This movie is also good for multiple viewings, as each one will reveal more subtle nuances that make the film that much better.  The bottom line is this: Fight Club is truly a statement to a new generation of people, a movie that simply blows you away. If you are willing to explore new realms of modern filmmaking, then give Fight Club a try. You will not be disappointed. This movie sets the standard for an entirely new genre of film.",5,Stunning!

Forget what you hear about the violence and gore and the menagerie of masochistic machismo, FIGHT CLUB is  really about a man (my age) who because of his insomnia and addiction to consumerism, has slowly lost his grip on reality. The violence is just a PART of his new life (and is truly minimal when you count the minutes of it in this 2-hour visual masterpiece). If you keep your mind open, you'll realize this movie isn't trying to condone violence, because in the end, Tyler Durden is not seen as the answer.David Fincher has made his second best film here, next to SE7EN.

518788,AGP0LMEHFQITC,B00003CWQ2,"James Lucas Chatfield ""Religion: musician""","[0, 0]","A lot of people didn't ""get"" Fight Club when they first saw it.  I suggested they watch it again.  Most of the people ""got it"" the second time, and they realized why they didn't ""get it"" the first time:  they were trying too hard.There are a lot of layers to this movie, to be sure, and if you watch it several times, you'll probably still find new things to appreciate about it the next time.  If you just didn't like it, well...  I don't know what to tell you.I'm not gonna give too much away here.  If you've seen it, you know this is a movie ripe with spoiler possibilities.  If you haven't, suffice it to say it's one man's take on society, personal identity, individuality, the catharsis of self-destruction...  and for those of you who didn't quite ""get it"":  this is not an action movie...  or a drama...  or a psychological puzzle.  This movie is a comedy.  A thick, sludgy, DAAAARRRRRK comedy... but if you're into that sorta thing, it's absolutely hilarious and brilliant.  Ed Norton plays the films single, 30-year-old career man, who's dull, structured lifestyle has bored him into a severe case of insomnia.  He finds relief in the emotional outbursts that he participates in by attending group therapy for illnesses and afflictions he doesn't actually have.  When another ""faker"", a quirkily depressing Helena Bonham Carter, throws him off his groove, his insomnia returns, but now he is strangely obsessed with her.  Enter Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden, a cynical, anti-conformist soap-salesman with a penchant for anarchic practical jokes at his many part-time jobs.  Norton and Pitt become roommates, and soon start Fight Club, a new support group where men meet, beat the crap out of each other, and find that hitting rock bottom gives you a whole new perspective on life.

Amongst this soup of fantastic film came a movie so odd, deranged and fantastic that it found immediate success.'Fight Club' was the brainchild of David Fincher in his quest to make one of his favourite novels into a film. The result was fantastic; the film exceeded all expectations. It turned out to be a novel that was hard to put in a category. Too realistic to  be an action film, too crazy to be a drama, too dark to be a 'happy-go-lucky' comedy. So where does that leave the viewer???A postmodern, black comedy dealing with the masculine need to fight and the power of one man to break through all sense of responcibility and live vicariously through an alter ego, namely 'Tyler Durden'The film is an utter mind bend from the get go, in which the audience is treated to a montage, and trip though Jack's brain where we finally end on the barrel of a gun. There are few that can boast they saw the ending coming. I won't say if you havent seen it go and see it.The performances are great Edward Norton is shining as ever and Brad Pitt is fantastic as Tyler Durden. Their perfomances make 'Fight Club' a great film, that could have been a sub-par film if not dealt with by actors of such a high callibre.Well....how to conclude??? JUST SEE FIGHT CLUB!!!!

I figured it was because of Brad Pit that she enjoyed it so much.  I walked out of the theatre in what you could call a state of shock.  This movie took me places that I never thought possible. It was more twisted than my own personal daydreams...  this movie rocked.  So when it came out on DVD, i bought it immeadiatly, and must have watched it 20-30 times in a row.  Now, i know im not the brightest person out there, but im not slow either... I learned, watched or understood something new every time i watched it. and i still do.  I would call this movie my anthem, the anthem for a 19 year old boy, who has just moved out into the world for himself, and trying to define himself.  In a world of possessions, i think i learned the most valuable lesson that can be taught, from a movie called Fight Club.  happines is not your clothes, toys, cars or amount of zeros in your bank account, happiness comes from your life, and what you make of it.

I think, (as weprobably all did), that FIGHT CLUB was going to be non-stop action, great acting, and maybe little, (if any) storyline. But boy was I wrong! Once you get the plot, it seems like the action scenes are more enjoyable and the film don't seem to drag on.The story is about a insomiac, (Edward Norton), who is looking for relief. So he joins this cancer club, where everyone comes together to tell their stories to one another. This &quot;brutal honesty&quot; as Norton puts it, help him release all his feelings, and can rest. Then he meets a soap salesman, named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) on an airplane. But once he gets back from his business trip, he finds that someone has committed arson, and his condo is ruined by a fire. This is when Tyler comes in the picture. As they start to fight, (not because of any problems, they just want to beat the hell out of each other!), they realize more and more, that other men want to fight as well. Thus begins FIGHT CLUB. With performances from Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, and Helena Bohnam-Carter, (which are Oscar caliber, or they atleast deserved a nomination), FIGHT CLUB is a brilliant film, with a really superb DVD.DVD SPECIAL FEATURES INCLUDED:* Region 1 encoding (US and Canada only)* Closed-captioned, THX* Commentary by director David Fincher* Commentary by Brad Pitt* Commentary by Composers* Commentary by Helena Bonham Carter* Commentary by Edward Norton* Production notes* Theatrical trailer(s)* Five Deleted Scenes and Outtakes* Still Galleries: Set Design Stills, Costume Stills, Original sketches, Oil paintings, Storyboards, Publicity stills, Lobby cards &amp; Production Stills* 17 behind-the-scenes vignettes* Making-Of Fight Club* THX Optimode* Widescreen anamorphic format (2:35:1)* Number of discs: 2",5,Superb!

Most of you know that Edward Norton and Brad Pitt give outstanding performances that will have you applauding.  Most of you know that the production values are up there with the best of them.  Most of you know that the script is brilliant, mostly because it is adapted from the best novel of all time.  And most of you know that David Fincher is a genius.  So I'll skip all that and get right to the big story here: Fight Club is being presented on D-VHS.For those of you unfamiliar with D-VHS, here's a quick fill-in.  The ""D"" stands for ""digital"" (obviously).  With a D-VHS player, you can record HDTV broadcast in its full 1080i scan lines without sacrificing quality.  And now that movies are finally coming out to own on the format, we can see them in high definition.  But how much better is it than the DVD?  Well, it's certainly good enough to take a look at.First, the video.  Anyone who bought the Fight Club DVD knows that it has excellent video and looks just down-right awesome.  The image here is even better.  Compared to the 480 scan lines on the DVD (progressive or interlaced depending on your player's output), the 1080i here helps the transfer enough to just squeak past the DVD.  One thing you'll notice right away is how the colors are perfect.  Black level is dead-on and colors never bleed or smear.  The DVD had some edge enhancement that wasn't too noticeable, but was there, nonetheless.  It ain't here on the D-VHS.  The image is so life-like and free from error that it looks like film.  If you consider yourself a videofile, you needn't look further for one of the most impressive video performances available for the consumer.Now, the audio.  Considered by many to be top demo material, the DVD edition of Fight Club had a staggering Dolby Digital EX mix.  Mayhem surrounded you wherever you were.  The surround back channel added to the three-dementionallity of the film.  It stood up to the best and held its own (even against powerhouses like Star Wars and Gladiator).  The Dolby mix here again just barely squeaks by the DVD release, and while it's not an official 6.1 mix, it decodes perfectly into the surround back, so those of you with 6.1 receivers needn't worry about that.  The only thing I'm really surprised with is the fact that no D-VHS titles have DTS tracks yet, especially considering there's nothing on the tape but the movie, a 5.1, and a 2.0 track.  They could have easily fit it in.  Oh, well.  Maybe in the future....So is D-VHS really worth it?  Well, at least with Fight Club it is.  With an absolutely perfect video presentation and a hard-hitting Dolby 5.1 mix, this is perfect for those just now getting into D-VHS and want to see if it's worth the investment.  Surpassing even the excellent DVD, I don't see why anyone with a D-VHS player would want to pass this up.Movie Grade: 5 stars (out of 5)Video Grade: 5 starsAudio Grade: 5 stars",5,The newest format tackles a personal favorite.,1040342400,"12 20, 2002",2002,2996,"['Okay', 'now', 'most', 'who', 'are', 'reading', 'review', 'already', 'know', 'how', 'good', 'movie', 'Fight', 'Club', 'Most', 'know', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'give', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'will', 'have', 'applauding', 'Most', 'know', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'up', 'there', 'best', 'Most', 'know', 'script', 'brilliant', 'mostly', 'adapted', 'best', 'novel', 'time', 'most', 'know', 'David', 'Fincher', 'genius', 'So', ""'ll"", 'skip', 'get', 'right', 'big', 'story', 'here', 'Fight', 'Club', 'being', 'presented', 'D-VHS.For', 'unfamiliar', 'D-VHS', 'here', 'quick', 'fill-in', 'D', 'digital', 'obviously', 'D-VHS', 'player', 'can', 'record', 'HDTV', 'broadcast', 'full', '1080i', 'scan', 'lines', 'sacrificing', 'quality', 'now', 'movies', 'are', 'finally', 'coming', 'out', 'own', 'format', 'can', 'see', 'high', 'definition', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'DVD', 'Well', 'certainly', 'good', 'enough', 'take', 'look', 'at.First', 'video', 'Anyone', 'who', 'bought', 'Fight', 'Club', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'video', 'just', 'down-right', 'awesome', 'image', 'here', 'even', 'better', 'Compared', '480', 'scan', 'lines', 'DVD', 'progressive', 'interlaced', 'depending', 'player', 'output', '1080i', 'here', 'transfer', 'enough', 'just', 'squeak', 'DVD', 'One', 'thing', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'right', 'away', 'how', 'colors', 'are', 'perfect', 'Black', 'level', 'dead-on', 'colors', 'never', 'bleed', 'smear', 'DVD', 'had', 'edge', 'enhancement', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'noticeable', 'was', 'there', 'nonetheless', 'ai', ""n't"", 'here', 'D-VHS', 'image', 'so', 'life-like', 'free', 'error', 'film', 'consider', 'videofile', 'need', ""n't"", 'look', 'further', 'one', 'most', 'impressive', 'video', 'performances', 'available', 'consumer.Now', 'audio', 'Considered', 'many', 'be', 'top', 'demo', 'material', 'DVD', 'edition', 'Fight', 'Club', 'had', 'staggering', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'EX', 'mix', 'Mayhem', 'surrounded', 'were', 'surround', 'back', 'channel', 'added', 'three-dementionallity', 'film', 'stood', 'up', 'best', 'held', 'own', 'even', 'powerhouses', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Gladiator', 'Dolby', 'mix', 'here', 'again', 'just', 'barely', 'squeaks', 'DVD', 'release', 'not', 'official', '6.1', 'mix', 'perfectly', 'surround', 'back', '6.1', 'receivers', 'need', ""n't"", 'worry', 'only', 'thing', ""'m"", 'really', 'surprised', 'fact', 'D-VHS', 'titles', 'have', 'DTS', 'tracks', 'yet', 'especially', 'considering', 'nothing', 'tape', 'movie', '5.1', '2.0', 'track', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'fit', 'Oh', 'well', 'Maybe', 'future', '.So', 'D-VHS', 'really', 'Well', 'least', 'Fight', 'Club', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'video', 'presentation', 'hard-hitting', 'Dolby', '5.1', 'mix', 'perfect', 'just', 'now', 'getting', 'D-VHS', 'want', 'see', 'investment', 'Surpassing', 'even', 'excellent', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'anyone', 'D-VHS', 'player', 'would', 'want', 'pass', 'up.Movie', 'Grade', '5', 'stars', '5', 'Video', 'Grade', '5', 'starsAudio', 'Grade', '5', 'stars']",N/A

518808,A62QGCRMIF6S2,B00003CWQ2,Jeff Storms,"[0, 1]","When Fight Club was first advertised in the theaters and on TV, people saw the ads for a typical, brainless movie about guys who like to beat the bejesus out of each other. What many of the viewers expected, however, was completely different from the results they received. Fight Club, sadly, was a victim of false advertising. In this case, the movie advertised was much different and the actual film was much, much better than it appeared to be.Fight Club is the story of our nameless narrator (played to perfection by Edward Norton). He has been having trouble sleeping and doesn't know why. He starts going to several self-help groups every night and soon discovers his bliss. Then, one day, Marla Singer came along. She, like our humble narrator, goes to these groups with no true diseases or disorders, just a fear of life. Norton begins to lose sleep yet again.Enter Tyler Durden. Our Narrator meets Tyler on a plane trip home, where he soon discovers that Tyler is something special. Durden shows our narrator how truly exciting life can be, and the two soon develop a great friendship. They both share the views on life as a prison for their minds, and together they form a secret society where men take out the aggressions of everyday life on each other.To say anymore would ruin the magic of the movie, so I will leave the plot summary as it is. As for the DVD, Fight Club is one of the most comprehensive DVDs on the market. With four, yes four, feature length commentaries, this is a truly extraordinary package. On disc two, there is a mind-boggling list of features, the most interesting being the behind the scenes footage of Fincher and crew at work. Also of interest are the deleted scenes, and while there may not be a large selection of them, they are quite plentiful. Perhaps one of the most visually entertaining parts of the special features is the exploration of the title sequence. To me, this is one of the shining points of Fincher's DVDs.All in all, Fight Club is a must for DVD enthusiasts and fans of bleak-society films. If you are expecting a brainless action vehicle, you're in for a major surprise.

However, I believe the opinion of the public is more applicable to the home viewer.This is a great movie!  Edward Norton as always is marvelous. He plays a slightly neurotic  insomniac trying to find the meaning in his life. He is addicted to the  home shopping network and tries to buy his happiness by filling his home  with everything he could possibly want. But it's not until he starts going  to various support groups for illnesses he doesn't have, that he begins to  feel he has a meaning to his life. Until one day he meets Tyler Durgen  (Brad Pitt) and everything changes. Remember that line: &quot; I want you  to hit me as hard as you can.&quot; From here on it is a roller coaster  ride exploring what men will really do to find their sense of self,  especially if they do not care what others may think, or what consequences  may come about. Ed's character soon gets in way over his head and by this  time, there's no turning back...This film also has an ambitious visual  style. Everything from Norton walking through a catalogue,(prices and all)  to some weird dream sequences. Oh!, and don't forget to look for the  &quot;hidden&quot; Brad Pitts. In several shots if you see a quick flash of  orange, or think something flashed on the screen, rewind, pause a few  seconds before, and then go frame by frame. You will see Brad Pitt's  character pop on the screen for a single frame in several spots in the  movie.Ok, if you have decided to watch this movie, be prepared to do a  lot of thinking once it's over.

I won't bother reviewing the movie itself becasue at this point, that would be a waste of everyone's time. I have been avoiding buying movies on Blu-Ray that I already own on DVD (I have over 500 DVD's, so that's avoiding a lot of movies) simply because that would be a financial nightmare and totally unjustifiable in most cases. The playstation 3 Blu-Ray player upconverts regular DVD's to make them look pretty nice on the 1080p tv so I haven't really felt the need for a better picture on most of my movies. Another annoying factor is the special editions of many of my DVD's have way more bonus features than the new Blu-Rays have, which is lame. The 10th Anniversary edition of Fight Club on Blu-Ray is awesome. It totally negates the need to hang on to my old Special Edition DVD and it looks fantastic. For anyone who says they can't tell the difference between this and DVD they are either blind or don't have the right equipment to view at full potential. I am very pleased with this Blu-Ray edition and for [...] bucks here on Amazon, I can't complain about buying another version of the same movie. It is loaded with special features, and is truly a new experience in watching this great movie.

518815,A2GVJ83F092MIS,B00003CWQ2,J. Hayes,"[4, 6]","Fight Club is a movie I wish I had seen earlier. I honestly don't even remember trailers during its theatrical release. But watching it for the first time I expected a violence-packed movie, nothing special. But this movie packs some deep and at times disturbing philosophy that will make you think about things. At the end of the movie it was instantly my favorite movie of all time. A lot of people share my opinion of Fight Club and some don't, finding it too extreme and disturbing to enjoy(and that opinion is okay too).Edward Norton's unnamed character is a man living with everything he could want in life. He has the right dining sets that define him as a person, the right furniture that looks clever in his perfect little apartment. He goes to work and does his job well because is expected to. One day this man's lifestyle obsession leads to his ultimate realization that none of these things define him as a person and none bring him satisfaction in life. The 9-5 office job, his near-perfect wardrobe and his clever yin-yang designed coffee table become too much for him to bear. Insomnia takes its toll and to cope Norton begins attending support groups for people who really know what pain is. All is well until he meets Marlene Singer, another person who is faking her way through the support groups to cope with her own miserable life. Norton cannot deal with this so again he spirals back into insomnia. In comes Tyler Durden, a man that is everything Norton's character is not, and an alter-ego created to deal with the things that are unbearable for him. Tyler Durden says ""All the ways you wish you could be, that's me. I look like you wanna look, I f*** like you wanna f***, I am smart, capable, and most importantly, I am free in all the ways that you are not.I will say this. If you dont know already Norton's character and Tyler Durden are the same person. I know I just gave it away but the awesome twist in the end where that fact is revealed is not the important idea in this movie, rather what is important is how and why it occured. Tyler was there to deal with everything in Norton's life that he could not deal with on his own. His way of doing this was first off starting the fight club. Here, men were not who they were in the outside world. Most were working class men getting by with life in the way advertising tells you life should be spent. Advertising has you working a job you hate to get things you dont need and these things were not essential to man's survival. But in Fight Club you were a man not concerned with the outside world and the image that world labeled you with. Fight Club grew and it became a much larger idea, Project Mayhem. It is here that ""Unnamed"" begins to lose his own grip on reality and see things go too far when Tyler has essentailly built an army to terrorize the part of society that tells you to look like this and tells you to act like that.Fight Club as I have stated is not everyones favorite movie and that is okay. You may disagree with its message and find its violence repulsive, but in my opinion it is a fascinating look into the human mind. Society really does shape us into people we should be to do things we don't always enjoy doing and people deal with it different ways(by accepting or rejecting the so-called lifestyle obsession). This is how one fictitious character dealt with it all. You can have many opinions on this film, but see it first and make your own opinion. It is a well-directed movie and features great acting performances from Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, and Helena Bonham Carter. If this is one of your favorite movies then I suggest the 2 disc version if you can find it.",5,Fights will go on as long as they have to...,1101340800,"11 25, 2004",2004,3676,"['Fight', 'Club', 'movie', 'wish', 'had', 'seen', 'earlier', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'remember', 'trailers', 'theatrical', 'release', 'watching', 'first', 'time', 'expected', 'violence-packed', 'movie', 'nothing', 'special', 'movie', 'deep', 'times', 'disturbing', 'philosophy', 'will', 'make', 'think', 'things', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'instantly', 'favorite', 'movie', 'time', 'lot', 'people', 'share', 'opinion', 'Fight', 'Club', 'do', ""n't"", 'finding', 'too', 'extreme', 'disturbing', 'enjoy', 'opinion', 'okay', 'too', '.Edward', 'Norton', 'unnamed', 'character', 'man', 'living', 'everything', 'could', 'want', 'life', 'right', 'dining', 'sets', 'define', 'person', 'right', 'furniture', 'clever', 'perfect', 'little', 'apartment', 'work', 'job', 'well', 'because', 'expected', 'One', 'day', 'man', 'lifestyle', 'obsession', 'ultimate', 'realization', 'none', 'things', 'define', 'person', 'none', 'bring', 'satisfaction', 'life', '9-5', 'office', 'job', 'near-perfect', 'wardrobe', 'clever', 'yin-yang', 'designed', 'coffee', 'table', 'become', 'too', 'much', 'bear', 'Insomnia', 'toll', 'cope', 'Norton', 'attending', 'support', 'groups', 'people', 'who', 'really', 'know', 'what', 'pain', 'well', 'Marlene', 'Singer', 'person', 'who', 'faking', 'way', 'support', 'groups', 'cope', 'own', 'miserable', 'life', 'Norton', 'can', 'not', 'deal', 'so', 'again', 'back', 'insomnia', 'Tyler', 'Durden', 'man', 'everything', 'Norton', 'character', 'not', 'alter-ego', 'created', 'deal', 'things', 'are', 'unbearable', 'Tyler', 'Durden', 'ways', 'wish', 'could', 'be', 'look', 'wan', 'na', 'look', 'f***', 'wan', 'na', 'f***', 'am', 'smart', 'capable', 'most', 'importantly', 'am', 'free', 'ways', 'are', 'not.I', 'will', 'say', 'dont', 'know', 'already', 'Norton', 'character', 'Tyler', 'Durden', 'are', 'same', 'person', 'know', 'just', 'gave', 'away', 'awesome', 'twist', 'end', 'where', 'fact', 'revealed', 'not', 'important', 'idea', 'movie', 'rather', 'what', 'important', 'how', 'why', 'occured', 'Tyler', 'was', 'there', 'deal', 'everything', 'Norton', 'life', 'could', 'not', 'deal', 'own', 'way', 'doing', 'was', 'first', 'starting', 'fight', 'club', 'Here', 'men', 'were', 'not', 'who', 'were', 'outside', 'world', 'Most', 'were', 'working', 'class', 'men', 'getting', 'life', 'way', 'advertising', 'tells', 'life', 'should', 'be', 'spent', 'Advertising', 'working', 'job', 'hate', 'get', 'things', 'dont', 'need', 'things', 'were', 'not', 'essential', 'man', 'survival', 'Fight', 'Club', 'were', 'man', 'not', 'concerned', 'outside', 'world', 'image', 'world', 'labeled', 'Fight', 'Club', 'grew', 'became', 'much', 'larger', 'idea', 'Project', 'Mayhem', 'here', 'Unnamed', 'lose', 'own', 'grip', 'reality', 'see', 'things', 'go', 'too', 'far', 'when', 'Tyler', 'essentailly', 'built', 'army', 'terrorize', 'part', 'society', 'look', 'act', 'that.Fight', 'Club', 'have', 'stated', 'not', 'everyones', 'favorite', 'movie', 'okay', 'may', 'disagree', 'message', 'find', 'violence', 'repulsive', 'opinion', 'fascinating', 'look', 'human', 'mind', 'Society', 'really', 'shape', 'people', 'should', 'be', 'do', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'enjoy', 'doing', 'people', 'deal', 'different', 'ways', 'accepting', 'rejecting', 'so-called', 'lifestyle', 'obsession', 'how', 'one', 'fictitious', 'character', 'dealt', 'can', 'have', 'many', 'opinions', 'film', 'see', 'first', 'make', 'own', 'opinion', 'well-directed', 'movie', 'great', 'acting', 'performances', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'then', 'suggest', '2', 'disc', 'version', 'can', 'find']",N/A

About the film itself, this has shown me that Hollywood can occasionally let out a masterpiece when it stops thinking about demographics and being 'politically correct' (or modern censorship). This film is gorgeously shot and lighted, the production values are stellar. I am always impressed with directors who use film as a visual art rather than just sticking a camera on actors. The dilapidated world of Fight Club is both repulsive and attractive, mirroring the moral decay of our world today. The cast is well-chosen, extremely subtle and natural. The script is magnificent, light and thoughtful. It brings across its ideas in a funny way and avoids dwelling and preaching. It explores many of the same themes and issues that were brought up in American Beauty, but in a far more risky manner. From the trailer  I had no idea this film is a comedy, a very funny film (my idea of a comedy is a strong story with some really funny moments, NOT a string of punch-lines and gags and schlock like you get from awful Adam Sandler, etc.) with some serious ideas. The world of yuppies living their vacuous lives, pursuing the almighty dollar and bragging about their boring SUVs (come on, they're just pickup trucks!) and stock portfolios is one I've long been tired of. Whatever happened to being human? To experiencing genuine feelings? To reaching out and connecting with others? This film asks those questions and cautions us by showing how someone leaping out of the shallow yuppy life might easily swing too far the other way. Yes there is a degree of violence but, as Edward Norton mentions in the commentary, it is not senseless video-game violence like you find in inferior juvenile films like The Matrix, etc. The violence in this film shows us just how far one man might travel in his life to find some sort of meaning that has been buried under the media's messages of 'buy and spend', 'look and act like everyone else by following these ads', etc. After the film I remembered the humor and the ideas, not the violence. If you are open-minded, tired of the usual Hollywood rubbish, view films as more than soulless entertainment, enjoy being your own person, like thinking and exposing yourself to ideas, then I can strongly recommend this to you. If you are close-minded, a yuppy, someone who moved to the suburbs because you don't feel comfortable around different people, actually like the new VW bug, think that money tells a person's worth, got married because everyone else did, follow fashion from ads rather than developing your own style, then watch this and try to learn that life is more than a string of possessions, trends and friends who accept you because you look like they do. If the money-obsessed lawyers who run Hollywood really want to make money, they should concentrate on making more films like this:  Edgy, thoughtful, cautionary, funny and made with real quality and care.",5,A great black comedy,969840000,"09 25, 2000",2000,2991,"['First', 'DVD', 'cram-packed', 'so', 'much', 'should', 'make', 'collector', 'grab', 'film', 'shown', 'Hollywood', 'can', 'occasionally', 'let', 'out', 'masterpiece', 'when', 'thinking', 'demographics', 'being', ""'politically"", 'correct', 'modern', 'censorship', 'film', 'gorgeously', 'shot', 'lighted', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'stellar', 'am', 'always', 'impressed', 'directors', 'who', 'use', 'film', 'visual', 'art', 'rather', 'just', 'sticking', 'camera', 'actors', 'dilapidated', 'world', 'Fight', 'Club', 'repulsive', 'attractive', 'mirroring', 'moral', 'decay', 'world', 'today', 'cast', 'well-chosen', 'extremely', 'subtle', 'natural', 'script', 'magnificent', 'light', 'thoughtful', 'ideas', 'funny', 'way', 'avoids', 'dwelling', 'preaching', 'many', 'same', 'themes', 'issues', 'were', 'brought', 'up', 'American', 'Beauty', 'far', 'more', 'risky', 'manner', 'trailer', 'had', 'idea', 'film', 'comedy', 'very', 'funny', 'film', 'idea', 'comedy', 'strong', 'story', 'really', 'funny', 'moments', 'NOT', 'string', 'punch-lines', 'gags', 'schlock', 'get', 'awful', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'etc', 'serious', 'ideas', 'world', 'yuppies', 'living', 'vacuous', 'lives', 'pursuing', 'almighty', 'dollar', 'bragging', 'boring', 'SUVs', 'come', ""'re"", 'just', 'pickup', 'trucks', 'stock', 'portfolios', 'one', ""'ve"", 'long', 'been', 'tired', 'happened', 'being', 'human', 'experiencing', 'genuine', 'feelings', 'reaching', 'out', 'connecting', 'others', 'film', 'questions', 'cautions', 'showing', 'how', 'someone', 'leaping', 'shallow', 'yuppy', 'life', 'might', 'easily', 'swing', 'too', 'far', 'other', 'way', 'Yes', 'degree', 'violence', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'mentions', 'commentary', 'not', 'senseless', 'video-game', 'violence', 'find', 'inferior', 'juvenile', 'films', 'Matrix', 'etc', 'violence', 'film', 'just', 'how', 'far', 'one', 'man', 'might', 'travel', 'life', 'find', 'sort', 'meaning', 'been', 'buried', 'media', 'messages', ""'buy"", 'spend', ""'look"", 'act', 'everyone', 'else', 'following', 'ads', 'etc', 'film', 'remembered', 'humor', 'ideas', 'not', 'violence', 'are', 'open-minded', 'tired', 'usual', 'Hollywood', 'rubbish', 'view', 'films', 'more', 'soulless', 'entertainment', 'enjoy', 'being', 'own', 'person', 'thinking', 'exposing', 'ideas', 'then', 'can', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'are', 'close-minded', 'yuppy', 'someone', 'who', 'moved', 'suburbs', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'comfortable', 'different', 'people', 'actually', 'new', 'VW', 'bug', 'think', 'money', 'person', 'worth', 'got', 'married', 'everyone', 'else', 'did', 'follow', 'fashion', 'ads', 'rather', 'developing', 'own', 'style', 'then', 'watch', 'try', 'learn', 'life', 'more', 'string', 'possessions', 'trends', 'friends', 'who', 'accept', 'look', 'do', 'money-obsessed', 'lawyers', 'who', 'run', 'Hollywood', 'really', 'want', 'make', 'money', 'should', 'concentrate', 'making', 'more', 'films', 'Edgy', 'thoughtful', 'cautionary', 'funny', 'made', 'real', 'quality', 'care']",N/A

It's the story of one everyday joe (A nameless Edward  Norton) and his stale, stagnant, lackluster life which is slowly spiralling  out of control. He suffers from insomnia, which he finds relief from by  going to self-help groups and twelve step programs. His new lifestyle is  destroyed by the entrance of Marla (Helena Bonham Carter in all her strung  out, gothic-esque glory) who is also faking her way through the  meetings...even testicular cancer support groups.On a random business  trip, Norton meets the straightforward, dynamic, and psychotic Tyler Durden  (Brad Pitt, looking like an utter thrift store reject) who immediately  changes his life. In order to release their own repressed hostilities,  Norton and Pitt begin to fight each other...and other men who are attracted  to the concept. Thus Fight Club was born. As time goes on Tyler begins a  destructive relationship with Marla and begins to assemble an army in order  to bring the materialistic culture he despises to it's knees. It spirals  more and more out of control until, in a very literal sense, Norton's world  comes crashing down.I found that though the story was dark and the  world within most inhospitable, I would very much enjoy a holiday in this  world that Pitt and Norton carve out for themselves.

518820,A3RB6NQOLOBXYD,B00003CWQ2,"Jimmy Lee ""James""","[1, 1]","To say that David Fincher's film Fight Club is underrated or for some intellectual film buffs would like to facetiously use the phrase, ""sleeper hit"", is possibly the biggest understatement of the last decade. One small but highly significant reason for this under appreciation (In terms of box office revenue) lies in the failure of the marketing department to promote this film appropriately. On the contrary, it's subject matter and material did not render this an easy task. With a very deceptive title like Fight Club, most audiences assumed this film to be simply just that, a film about fighting. Nothing could be farther from the truth. In 1999 all that the film had going for it was Brad Pitt, end of story. Although I have not seen all of David Fincher's films I feel it is safe to assume that this will probably be one of my favorites among his other impressive titles in his catalog. This film is not just a highly successful book to film adaptation, (not to mention put Chuck Palahnuik on the map as a respected author) but manages to execute it's dark, witty, clever dialogue in such a timely and entertaining fashion that it remains quite memorable and very satisfying. The 10th anniversary Blu Ray edition of this movie is nothing short of spectacular; it's audio and visual department does not disappoint, but truly and fully utilizes the Blu Ray technology to its advantage. The technical part of my review will be saved for the last so I hope you will pace yourself. Enough said, I will begin.The narrator (Edward Norton), who does not go by any particular name in the film, works for an insurance company that investigates claims involving automobiles. His mundane but financially rewarding occupation requires very extensive traveling that renders the narrator to lead a very isolated and lonely life. Even when he is not traveling, we see him completing very repetitive sedentary office work that involves little interaction with anyone besides his unlikeable and distasteful boss. Adversely, this demanding occupation profoundly affects the narrator's ability to sleep as he suffers from acute insomnia and what also appears to be severe depression. As a result, Norton's derives a substantial amount of pleasure indulging in magazine catalogs and purchasing various collector set items such as trendy furniture, fashionable dish sets with all the small intended imperfections, tread mills, coffee tables, and other novelties. In order to treat his insomnia, the narrator consults a doctor only to find out that he will not be prescribed any medication but suggested to seek treatment in support groups for various forms of cancer to witness real ""pain"". Subsequently, an addiction follows from this experience when Norton admit tingly feels attracted to the universal atmosphere of sadness and emotional engagement with strangers. (Meat Loaf being one of them, go figure) It is here that the narrator comes across a woman named Martha (Helena Bonham Carter) who is a ""faker"" according to him because she does not genuinely suffer from any of the interminable diseases in the support groups but only participates for the movies and free coffee.On a plane during a midnight business travel we are introduced to Edward Norton's significant other/anti-hero, Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) when they are seated next to each other. Tyler Durden is a very clever, knowledgeable and highly entertaining salesman in the business of selling soap. He is filled with arbitrary useful facts about potentially explosive household items, history and even philosophy to some extent; moreover, he comes across as very dark but amusing and personally engaging to say the very least. There on screen chemistry is highly plausible and works to perfection in every scene. The relationship between these two characters is further solidified when they meet for the second time after Norton's trendy apartment is mysteriously blown to bits all over the sidewalk. The narrator ponders the root cause to be a freak electrical occurrence. Despite of this catastrophic event (or is it ?), Norton finds comfort in calling Tyler Durden where they rendezvous at a local bar for some drinks; the narrator vents over his materialistic losses while Tyler Durden simply offers some solace with a very interesting and enlightening outlook on the relationship between human evolution and American culture.The narrator and Tyler Durden embark on a dark journey that reveals the truth about themselves and about society as well; and, as a result, a much deeper and more genuine relationship occurs between these two characters especially when Tyler Durden asks Norton for a favor in return for his hospitable shelter, ""To hit him as hard as he can.""Now, this film packs a very heavy social commentary that delves around many salient topics and themes that are bound to strike some interest in the careful and observant film goer. (At least I hope so) Personally, what struck me as important and intriguing what it's social commentary on corporations and their potentially adverse effects on American culture and human emotions, or in the narrator's case, lack thereof. The narrator exhibits symptoms of insomnia because he is ultimately depressed working in a single serving, dispensable and yet fast paced environment (at least when he's traveling) that deprives him of maintaing any real interaction with friends and family. Unfortunately and in spite of this, we see him enjoying the true and last American value in this country that becomes more prevalent within each passing year, consumerism, or as Tyler Durden puts it more plainly and effectively ""Buying S--- we don't need"".The narrator's life is consumed by the corporation as he inspects some of the most horrific car accidents, spends a considerable amount of time air traveling not too mention ordered around by a very unpleasant and discontented boss who is rarely satisfied. Let's just say that his work environment does not fully endorse the mechanism of positive reinforcement. A profound feeling of emptiness engulfs this character to the extreme point of him finding solace in things such as cancer support groups or in buying endless items in magazine catalogs; the narrator is merely struggling to find any form of emotion in this depraved and depressing American culture we live in. As a result, our anti-hero fills this empty space with feeling pain in fighting and even indulges in what seems to be a subtle form of masochistic behavior such as burning himself with chemicals or throwing himself into glass shelves. The corporation persistently produces this potent and profound feeling of emptiness that strips the narrator of his individuality by artificially organizing it for him. You are not an individual but a team member or a team player working for a much bigger and more important company. And we wonder why so many Americans are prescribed anti-depressant drugs and medication. The bottom line is that the individual is more often than not wrongly perceived as the problem and not the sick cultural environment that one works or interacts in.Ok, onto the technical specs of this masterpiece because that is what this film is and looks like, a masterpiece. I purchased the 2-disc dvd back in 2002 and I was utterly impressed with the quality of it along with it's array of supplemental material. Without exaggerating in the slightest bit, this Blu Ray completely puts the previous dvd release to shame. I did a thorough compare and contrast and it was worth every minute of to see the nice upgrade make it to my home. If I had to describe this transfer in one word, the word flawless justifies this very accurately.Cinematically, this is a very dark film indeed that manages to seamlessly and effectively intertwine with the nature of the material presented. Black levels are incredibly deep and consistent that allow some of the more bright colors to filter through quite nicely, particularly in the underground garage scenes. Pay attention to the vibrant and lively green neon reflections when the camera rapidly spirals down into the garage to expose the detonated explosives. Truly remarkable. Flesh tones are real and appear very natural and lifelike throughout the entire film whether it is during the abundant night shots, the interior house on paper st, the underground garage, or the massive corporate buildings. When Edward Norton attempts to deactivate one of the sets of explosives in the white van pay close attention to the sweat drops on his forehead or Brad Pitt's light facial hair, amazing.Like the picture quality, the sound will not disappoint either boasting a very nice DTS. 5.1 HD Master Audio. The Dust Brothers will immerse you in it's highly unusual and nerve racking industrial score. All of your speakers will given the royal treatment with this one, I can assure you on this. Dialogue is nothing short of perfection; moreover, it is clear, articulate and very consistent. I can also rest assure you that your subwoofer will not be left alone in the dark either as explosions will vibrate your floor while the heart pounding score will add a nice touch to the unsettling atmosphere. Every scene in this film is quite mesmerizing in terms of picture and sound but If I could specifically point out a great scene in which captivates all of these things accurately, I will have to say pay attention to when Edward Norton deactivates the explosive in the garage and subsequently battles Tyler Durden; shattered car mirrors will pierce your front speakers; glass toll booths breaks with superiority, hand to hand combat is exchanged wonderfully and a very nice clothesline executed by Tyler Durden will definitely spark some enthusiasm.This by far one of the most superior and worthy Blu Rays out on the Market. Enough Said. A must buy.",5,"Blu Ray Review: After ten years, Fight Club ages like the finest wine",1025308800,"06 29, 2002",2002,9822,"['say', 'David', 'Fincher', 'film', 'Fight', 'Club', 'underrated',

Trailers and clips made FIGHT CLUB look like a film glorifying silly WWE-style backyard brawls.The opening credits zoom out of Ed Norton's body and up a pistol held by Tyler Durden (Pitt).  Norton narrates the story to bring the viewer up to speed.His character is firmly enmeshed as a dull, desensitized slave toiling as a claims adjuster, an easy, well-paid desk job. He rents a high-rise apartment bloated with designer furniture, name brand clothes, name brand food...He's addicted to and comforted by male support groups. Then, one day, a woman (Helena Bonham Carter) ups and decides to sit in.A chance meeting with soap salesman Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) prods Norton's character to blow up his safe, materialistic life and take residence in a dump on the edge of town. He and Tyler (Pitt) form a support group called FIGHT CLUB. Therapy sessions include gladiator tournaments designed to amp up aggression. Participants emerge pulpy but there are no losers. They are hirelings and chumps in the outside world. The brutish matches empower them. Groups prior to FIGHT CLUB reinforced their weakness, like E.D (erectile dysfunction. Ironically, a member of this group, a steroid abuser, has breasts). Finally they had a club no woman would join, a real MEN'S club.FIGHT CLUB is stunning and ultra-violent and open to interpretation including society's addiction to icons. As Tyler Durden (Pitt's character) says: ""The things you own end up owning you."" The solution, he believes, is to fight and give up being perfect. Bruises, swollen eyes, broken teeth and cut lips are trophies. Another aspect of the movie is idol worship. There is one scene that is especially grotesque and beautiful in illustrating the paradox of FIGHT CLUB. Norton horribly disfigures a new recruit. Asked why he replied nonchalantly that he ""wanted to destroy something beautiful."" This, to me, foretold the direction of the organization towards vandalism.The picture has a slick green hue similar to the sheen of the Matrix movies, or the hard, silver tint James Cameron uses. CGI is very effective throughout. Norton's fear is exposed in a chaotic sequence showing his internal physiology. In another, the picture jumps like a speaker to Brad Pitt's voice. Fight Club feels like a graphic novel-- very surreal and fun to look at. But it's not for everyone. Fincher did a great job. He could have shined it up and turned the noise down but didn't.

WOW!!.....This is honestly the best movie i have ever seen! I have watched it at least 40 times now and EVERY time I see something else that I missed.Without ruining the ending, let me simply say that if you think this is a macho movie about fighting, you are dead wrong. It's psychological. It's deep. After watching it many times you start to see the simple wisdom hidden in it. The lines are uttered on one level but resonate on many deeper planes...Tyler is pushing Ed Norton to wake up and see things as they really are. But he won't. And we can all relate to him.

Then this movie is for you.When I saw Seven, I left the theatre thinking &quot;why was I put through that?&quot;  I wondered &quot;who enjoys seeing such pain?&quot;Fight Club is like Seven in an important respect: it shows a lot of human bodies being mistreated.  In this movie, however, most of the people being mistreated _choose_ it.UNfortunately, this movie is much more funny and entertaining than Seven.  It's even insightful about what people do when their life has no meaning or purpose.I don't mind a movie that jars your everyday sensibilities for some important purpose, but Fight Club, as a film, is fundamentally concerned with a destructive and self-destructive individual.  The film blames his actions on a supposed materialistic soullessness of modern society (stupid old mistaken idea -- Yawn).  Then it makes light of itself by being funny.Be careful whom you laugh with.Simply watching this movie is a self-destructive act.  It is seductive and entertaining, while inciting hatred for good, productive people.The movie itself is the cinematic incarnation of Tyler Durden himself.  It appeals to your inner criminal.Sadly, it is extremely well executed.  The film is a technical masterpiece, worthy of study by future directors.  Great skill has been applied to dull your sense that there's something wrong with what the film is advocating: the destruction of health and wealth.  The final event in the film says it all.Unlike the characters in this film, don't buy into the thrill of abuse.  Don't choose to be mistreated.  Don't see this film if you want to defend your life's purpose.  If you do, then -- like the men in the film -- you'll be sucked just a little further into someone's dimented, destructive, _purposeless_ fantasy.Contrary to what the film implies, &quot;consumerism&quot; (concern with achieving values) isn't sucking out our souls.

518832,ABX7SEE84DMLU,B00003CWQ2,John P Bernat,"[7, 14]","This film reveals, in a very disconcertingly direct way, the essence of being a man.You can't help despising every one of the characters. Ed Norton plays a weak, neurotic nonentity. Helena Bonham Carter plays a thoroughly unpleasant lowlife.Brad Pitt plays Tyler, an insufferable overaged brat. He's a smug, know-it-all ""nonconformist.""  Luckily for Tyler, his physical attractiveness lends credibility to his long lectures on manhood, because their content is direct and undestandable.  We've all heard this rhetoric many times before, but never done better.What starts out as suburban white guys whining about how they can no longer assume as a given a life of effortless wealth, privilege, and power turns into something much more elemental. Their jobs are dull and don't offer intellectual challenge, spiritual fulfillment, or satisfaction. In other words, they've been cheated out of what they'd considered their rightful due as men.Tyler's solution is to reclaim their masculinity or overthrow the corporate hierarchy by picking fistfights and blowing stuff up. This becomes popular with other suburban white guys with way too much time on their hands, who decide that they're all victims, too, and that they all want to pick fights and blow stuff up, too.  Direct and functional.This spirals out of control, Sorcerer's-Apprentice-like, and evolves into a dystopian cult/army of suburban white guys; complete with rules, chants, and rituals. The members of ""Fight Club"" start as sheep-like drones mindlessly obeying corporate bosses, and end as rebels in touch with their manhood, following Tyler like sheep.The movie is well made, well acted, and visually interesting. It makes important points about the amorality of megacorporations and the inadequacy of consumer capitalism as a substitute for independence, worthwhile work, and fulfillment.One thing I found really disturbing, though, is that I saw no African-American, Hispanic, or blue-collar characters, although those groups face at least as many difficulties and injustices as the middle-class office workers depicted. The lone woman character is physically and personally repellent -- worse, her only purpose seems to be as a spittoon for the men.Of course, the message reverses at the end of the movie.  If any man's self-worth and autonomy depend on a ""masculinity"" defined as brutality, then a dull job is the least of your problems.  Companies are in business to make money -- period -- and nobody's life is fun every minute of every day. If you're bored or unfulfilled -- paint a picture, climb a mountain, volunteer at the homeless shelter -- do whatever matters to you or others.If you hate consumerism -- throw your cellphone in the trash and wear your 1980s-vintage stonewashed jeans until they fall apart.Testosterone run amuck and mindless nihilism have cathartic appeal to angry, frustrated adolescent boys of all ages.  Each man is called to view this dialectic critically by the time this movie finishes.""Fight Club"" is still a movie about picking fistfights and blowing stuff up, of course.  These are vehicles for a visceral message about what manhood is.

I thought it was, at best, stupid, and at worst, completely irresponsible.Damn was I wrong! When my wife asked me if we were ""ever"" going to watch the DVD, I reluctantly gave in. A little over two hours later I had to admit: I LOVED it!Ed Norton plays the ""Narrator."" When the film opens, Norton has the barrel of a gun inserted in his mouth, courtesy of Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt.) Norton (as the Narrator) explains how he's arrived at this less-than-pleasant point in his life, and the film flashes back to a time shortly before Narrator meets Durden.We learn that Narrator works for a ""major"" automobile manufacturer in a position of questionable moral standing. Though it evidently pays well, (based upon his very well-decorated, upscale apartment), it involves making judgements for the company as to whether or not to recall autos based upon a mathematical formula that calculates the cost of lawsuits vs. the cost of actually fixing the problem. In a nutshell, if the lawsuits are cheaper, people die. This disturbs Narrator, but not so much that he's willing to give up the perks of the job.Returning from one of his frequent cross-country business trips, he winds up sitting next to Durden. Striking up a conversation, he learns that Durden is somewhat mysterious, even to the point of holding back what he does for a living, although he ultimately reveals that he's a manufacturer of hand-made soap, and gives Narrator a card.Good thing. Because when Narrator gets home from the airport, he finds that all of his beloved possessions are scattered around the foot of his apartment building, having been blown out the windows by a terrific explosion.Having no place to spend the night, he calls his new friend, they meet for a couple of beers, and upon leaving the bar, Durden eggs him on about ""not asking"" if he can stay at his place. While at first he denies that was the intent of his having called him, he finally gives in and asks Durden if he'd mind. He wouldn't. But before they go walking off to Durden's house, Durden asks Narrator to hit him. Hard.Narrator looks at him as if he's insane, but after being asked a couple of times, Narrator finally give in and clocks him in the ear. Durden returns the punch and they end up both 'going at it.' Much to his surprise, Narrator finds that the fight was absolutely exhilarating. And thus begins a very strange, but very well-done movie.",4,Glad I gave in!,1027555200,"07 25, 2002",2002,2792,"['brother-in-law', 'loaned', 'Fight', 'Club', 'DVD', '3', 'months', 'kept', 'putting', 'off', 'viewing', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'film.From', 'seeing', 'previews', 'had', 'idea', 'film', 'glorified', 'fighting', 'recalled', 'scene', 'where', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'character', ""'assignment"", 'go', 'out', 'start', 'fight', 'stranger.My', 'reaction', 'time', 'was', 'extremely', 'negative', 'thought', 'was', 'best', 'stupid', 'worst', 'completely', 'irresponsible.Damn', 'was', 'wrong', 'When', 'wife', 'asked', 'were', 'ever', 'going', 'watch', 'DVD', 'reluctantly', 'gave', 'little', 'two', 'hours', 'later', 'had', 'admit', 'LOVED', 'Ed', 'Norton', 'Narrator', 'When', 'film', 'Norton', 'barrel', 'gun', 'inserted', 'mouth', 'courtesy', 'Tyler', 'Durden', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Norton', 'Narrator', 'how', 'arrived', 'less-than-pleasant', 'point', 'life', 'film', 'back', 'time', 'shortly', 'Narrator', 'meets', 'Durden.We', 'learn', 'Narrator', 'major', 'automobile', 'manufacturer', 'position', 'questionable', 'moral', 'standing', 'evidently', 'well', 'based', 'very', 'well-decorated', 'upscale', 'apartment', 'making', 'judgements', 'company', 'not', 'recall', 'autos', 'based', 'mathematical', 'formula', 'cost', 'lawsuits', 'cost', 'actually', 'fixing', 'problem', 'nutshell', 'lawsuits', 'are', 'cheaper', 'people', 'die', 'disturbs', 'Narrator', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'willing', 'give', 'up', 'perks', 'job.Returning', 'one', 'frequent', 'cross-country', 'business', 'trips', 'up', 'sitting', 'next', 'Durden', 'Striking', 'up', 'conversation', 'Durden', 'somewhat', 'mysterious', 'even', 'point', 'holding', 'back', 'what', 'living', 'ultimately', 'manufacturer', 'hand-made', 'soap', 'Narrator', 'card.Good', 'thing', 'when', 'Narrator', 'home', 'airport', 'beloved', 'possessions', 'are', 'scattered', 'foot', 'apartment', 'building', 'having', 'been', 'blown', 'out', 'windows', 'terrific', 'explosion.Having', 'place', 'spend', 'night', 'new', 'friend', 'meet', 'couple', 'beers', 'leaving', 'bar', 'Durden', 'not', 'asking', 'can', 'stay', 'place', 'first', 'was', 'intent', 'having', 'called', 'finally', 'asks', 'Durden', ""'d"", 'mind', 'would', ""n't"", 'go', 'walking', 'off', 'Durden', 'house', 'Durden', 'Narrator', 'hit', 'Hard.Narrator', 'insane', 'being', 'asked', 'couple', 'times', 'Narrator', 'finally', 'give', 'clocks', 'ear', 'Durden', 'punch', 'end', 'up', ""'going"", 'Much', 'surprise', 'Narrator', 'fight', 'was', 'absolutely', 'exhilarating', 'thus', 'very', 'strange', 'very', 'well-done', 'movie']",N/A

518836,A35HF8V3AZR0O,B00003CWQ2,Jon Ballenger,"[1, 2]","Fight Club is one of those movies that you either love or hate. In my case, I found the plot and characters very interesting. The idea of feeling good (or bad, I was not sure) about your life by pounding the crap out of each other was an idea that might not have worked out under another director's belt. But Fight Club's director, David Fincher (Se7en, Alien 3) does what he does best in creating a dark, creepy setting, full of plot twists and clever dialogue. In the beginning, Fight Club is full of humor. Our unnamed hero goes to support groups for people with various diseases. Although he does not have any of these diseases, he goes to feel better about himself. The first 30 minutes could be described as a dark comedy, but as the film progresses into the actual ""Fight Club"" stage, it gets more and more like a psychological thriller. Though, through bloody fights and confusing plot twists, we begin to see that Fight Club is much more than just a thriller.

David Finch's direction, Brad Pitt is hilarious and great, Edward Norton magnificent, Helena Bonham Carter too. There are some travelling/macro/zoom out scenes that'll keep your finger on the rewind button. The scene where Norton fight with his boss is memorable. As is the catalog view of the world. The art direction is beautiful. Some fight scenes are hard, but they're fast, have a reason to be there and are not &quot;butcher made&quot;. As I said, this is not a movie on violence, like Warriors is. The real fight, here, is personal. Can't say more. The extras are great, just like on the Se7en DVD, also directed by Fincher. There are making off of most interesting scenes, lots of commentaries, a funny faux products catalog and other things that'll keep you entertained for many times. I had some blockings against this movie, since and imbecil entered a cinema here in Sao Paulo with something like an Uzi and killed 3 people on a session of it. Well, after seeing the trailer on the web and watching it, I realized that that guy was much more than an imbecil: a psycho that was involved with drugs, family problems and much more and, thanks to all his mind blowing addictions and problems misunderstood this movie.

So, all I will do is give my own ten short and punchy (pun intended) reasons why ""Fight Club"" is a must-see DVD:1) The complex characters. I loved the way viewers can look on the actions of our heroes as maybe a little strange (and even feel outright revulsion as the ""fight club"" concept flowers among their hundreds of followers), yet we can still identify and sympathize with the cultural pressures that drove them to develop their unusual outlet.2) The bizarre, jaw-dropping scenes. Swiping discarded human fat from the dumpsters at the liposuction clinic so that our heroes can make designer soap from it and sell it back to fat-cat women blissfully unaware that they contributed the main ingredient for its manufacture? I was on the floor!3) David Fincher's direction. Never over-directed, never under-directed. Just right.4) The ""Sixth Sense"" style revelation about four-fifths of the way in. It was clever and surprising, and provided yet another reason to watch the film a second time, to catch all the subtle clues planted early on.5)All the extras in the DVD edition. It takes a second disc to fit them all. Nuff said.6) The amazingly funny scenes. Even the throw-away lines had me rolling, like when we learned Tyler was the defendent in a class-action suit filed as a result of the high urine content in the soup he was serving at the hotel restaurant where he worked!7) The crystal-clear DVD transfer. What a picture!8) The great packaging, colorful and eye-catching. And I loved that the booklet with the DVDs proudly included as many negative reviews of the film as positive ones. So subversive!9) The great acting. Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter, and-- yes!-- Meat Loaf were all perfectly in tune with the material and made us totally believe in them, despite the crazy situations in which they found themselves. And Meat Loaf accomplished that while wearing large female breasts for the duration of the film!10) The closing moments. What vision! We see tender words exchanged in the foreground between two of the major characters (I don't want to give too much away here) while outside the window behind them unfolds the strangest, most apocalyptic vision seen in a movie in recent years. I didn't know whether to laugh or stare in amazement, so I did both.I made the mistake of missing this film during its theatrical run (temporary insanity on my part), but had a ball discovering it on DVD....",5,Buy or rent this right now!,962236800,"06 29, 2000",2000,2562,"[""'ve"", 'read', 'scores', 'comprehensive', 'reviews', 'extraordinary', 'film', 'here', 'Amazon.com', 'little', 'can', 'add', 'So', 'will', 'do', 'give', 'own', 'ten', 'short', 'punchy', 'pun', 'intended', 'reasons', 'why', 'Fight', 'Club', 'must-see', 'DVD:1', 'complex', 'characters', 'loved', 'way', 'viewers', 'can', 'look', 'actions', 'heroes', 'maybe', 'little', 'strange', 'even', 'feel', 'outright', 'revulsion', 'fight', 'club', 'concept', 'flowers', 'hundreds', 'followers', 'yet', 'can', 'still', 'identify', 'sympathize', 'cultural', 'pressures', 'drove', 'develop', 'unusual', 'outlet.2', 'bizarre', 'jaw-dropping', 'scenes', 'Swiping', 'discarded', 'human', 'fat', 'dumpsters', 'liposuction', 'clinic', 'heroes', 'can', 'make', 'designer', 'soap', 'sell', 'back', 'fat-cat', 'women', 'blissfully', 'unaware', 'contributed', 'main', 'ingredient', 'manufacture', 'was', 'floor', '3', 'David', 'Fincher', 'direction', 'Never', 'over-directed', 'never', 'under-directed', 'Just', 'right.4', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'style', 'revelation', 'four-fifths', 'way', 'was', 'clever', 'surprising', 'provided', 'yet', 'reason', 'watch', 'film', 'second', 'time', 'catch', 'subtle', 'clues', 'planted', 'early', 'on.5', 'extras', 'DVD', 'edition', 'second', 'disc', 'fit', 'Nuff', 'said.6', 'amazingly', 'funny', 'scenes', 'Even', 'throw-away', 'lines', 'had', 'rolling', 'when', 'learned', 'Tyler', 'was', 'defendent', 'class-action', 'suit', 'filed', 'result', 'high', 'urine', 'content', 'soup', 'was', 'serving', 'hotel', 'restaurant', 'where', 'worked', '7', 'crystal-clear', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'What', 'picture', '8', 'great', 'packaging', 'colorful', 'eye-catching', 'loved', 'booklet', 'DVDs', 'proudly', 'included', 'many', 'negative', 'reviews', 'film', 'positive', 'ones', 'So', 'subversive', '9', 'great', 'acting', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'yes', 'Meat', 'Loaf', 'were', 'perfectly', 'tune', 'material', 'made', 'totally', 'believe', 'crazy', 'situations', 'found', 'Meat', 'Loaf', 'accomplished', 'wearing', 'large', 'female', 'breasts', 'duration', 'film', '10', 'closing', 'moments', 'What', 'vision', 'see', 'tender', 'words', 'exchanged', 'foreground', 'two', 'major', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'here', 'window', 'strangest', 'most', 'apocalyptic', 'vision', 'seen', 'movie', 'recent', 'years', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'laugh', 'stare', 'amazement', 'did', 'both.I', 'made', 'mistake', 'missing', 'film', 'theatrical', 'run', 'temporary', 'insanity', 'part', 'had', 'ball', 'discovering', 'DVD']",N/A

I am 24 years old and relate to many of the social problems related in this film. Being that capitalism drives this  country it is obivious that we as a people have to consume large quanities  of products to run our economy. Everywhere you look and I mean everywhere;  there is an advertisement telling you of your need to buy. billboards,  television comercials, magazines, matchbooks, and whatever else.  Consumerism can be a soul taking action once people begin to equate what  they own with who they are. Television is a big culprit in this. Be like  Mike drink Gatorade(gatorade is a trademark of blah..blah..blah) drive this  car it says you're successful. As many of my generation I grew up with the  wonderful electronic babysitter. It was always on in my house think of it  as a communal fireplace. I had no real direction in life other than I felt  the need to be entertained. Fight club also takles the fact that men have  been feminized over the years. Men in are current climate are seen mostly  as sperm donors rather than people. Their masculine agressive instincts are  seen as a negative. So take an T.V overdosed male, place him in an eight by  eight cubicle after college in a stressful job. How does that person cope.  Fight club faces these issues by showing extremes. It offers no outcomes  only the problems. Which I feel is a flaw of the film. To those who dislike  the movie I say this. Should we really turn a blind eye to the ugliness  that sometimes surfaces in life? I feel we should think about them to try  to solutions on an individual level. Which is what I feel this movie was  about. Raising an issue to provoke thought. Also Fight Club does not  promote anarchy.",5,consumer beware,963360000,"07 12, 2000",2000,1797,"['watched', 'movie', 'fourth', 'July', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'great', 'choice', 'Independence', 'Day', 'am', '24', 'years', 'old', 'relate', 'many', 'social', 'problems', 'related', 'film', 'Being', 'capitalism', 'country', 'obivious', 'people', 'have', 'consume', 'large', 'quanities', 'products', 'run', 'economy', 'Everywhere', 'look', 'mean', 'everywhere', 'advertisement', 'telling', 'need', 'buy', 'billboards', 'television', 'comercials', 'magazines', 'matchbooks', 'else', 'Consumerism', 'can', 'be', 'soul', 'taking', 'action', 'once', 'people', 'begin', 'equate', 'what', 'own', 'who', 'are', 'Television', 'big', 'culprit', 'Be', 'Mike', 'drink', 'Gatorade', 'gatorade', 'trademark', 'blah..blah..blah', 'drive', 'car', ""'re"", 'successful', 'many', 'generation', 'grew', 'up', 'wonderful', 'electronic', 'babysitter', 'was', 'always', 'house', 'think', 'communal', 'fireplace', 'had', 'real', 'direction', 'life', 'other', 'felt', 'need', 'be', 'entertained', 'Fight', 'club', 'also', 'fact', 'men', 'have', 'been', 'feminized', 'years', 'Men', 'are', 'current', 'climate', 'are', 'seen', 'mostly', 'sperm', 'donors', 'rather', 'people', 'masculine', 'agressive', 'instincts', 'are', 'seen', 'negative', 'So', 'take', 'T.V', 'overdosed', 'male', 'place', 'eight', 'eight', 'cubicle', 'college', 'stressful', 'job', 'How', 'person', 'cope', 'Fight', 'club', 'issues', 'showing', 'extremes', 'outcomes', 'only', 'problems', 'Which', 'feel', 'flaw', 'film', 'who', 'dislike', 'movie', 'say', 'Should', 'really', 'turn', 'blind', 'eye', 'ugliness', 'sometimes', 'life', 'feel', 'should', 'think', 'try', 'solutions', 'individual', 'level', 'Which', 'what', 'feel', 'movie', 'was', 'about', 'Raising', 'issue', 'provoke', 'thought', 'Also', 'Fight', 'Club', 'not', 'promote', 'anarchy']",N/A

Immature young men will be  deliciously provoked by this movie; others will want to give it a wide  berth.Brad Pitt wears obnoxious floral-print shirts and a bottle of Dep  on his head.

The photography is some of the  worst I've seen lately:  it has the color of Army camouflage  (but I guess  that's what's supposed to be clever about it).The film tries to be  &quot;intelligent&quot;  early on, but only achieves a facile cleverness.  It's far too conscious of the audience's reactions, which mars the supposed  purpose of  &quot;enlightening&quot;  us to the ugly truths about our  commericalized society.  The truth about Tyler Durden, as revealed at the  end of the movie, will not surprise smart viewers, but it will doubtlessly  blow away its target audience:  angry 15-year-old boys who will make a cult  phenom of it, forever placing it in the ranks of the Cool Movies.

When you read Romeo and Juliet, are you supposed to think that violence solves life's problems? When you look at Guernica, do you think that bombings are beneficial to human life?Fight Club is not an 'action' movie. It is a black comedy featuring social commentary and revolutionary visuals. It also features one of the greatest acting talents of our time, Edward Norton, as well as one of the most underrated actors, Brad Pitt, in a fantastic journey through the dark heart of american men. The cinematography, direction, sound and computer effects are all outstanding. They are beyond reproach.Many complain about the plot. Well, it started as a novel, and it was quite consistent and faithful to the original. Others complain that the ending was unbelievable and ruined the movie. Well, this is simply unfortunate. I personally thought the ending was fantastic, and gave the film a second layer where before there was but one. If you dislike the ending, you probably did not allow the film to draw you in and surround you in its universe. This movie requires your full attention and an open mind.If you require large explosions, naked women and extreme violence to enjoy a film, you probably won't like fight club. Ironically, the film does feature all three in varying degrees. But most importantly, the themes and opinions put forth in Fight Club are not necessarily those of the filmmakers. I'm sure David Fincher doesn't endorse murder or other depravity, but he felt it was important to include in the film to be faithful to the story.

It begins with the protagonist, his insomnia, and finding solace in attending support groups. He is also materialistic browsing through IKEA catalogues looking for the 'dining set that best defines him' and works at a lucrative job. His life is about to chance when he meets the eccentric and somewhat psychotic Tyler Durden on an airplane, and ends up living with him aftersome extenuating circumstances. Throughout the film, Durden (played brilliantly by Brad Pitt) and the protagonist (Ed Norton) form their own way of life, randomly being philosophical and observing human nature and obstentanious materialism, and the 'fight club' they started turn into a mini-army, and the ending of the film is one of the most surprising twists ever in a movie.Adding to Norton and Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter plays the pessimistic ..., Marla Singer, who serves as a nuisance to the narrator but an object of Tyler's 'affection' (if you want to call it that). Surprisingly, Meat Loaf (that's right... that guy) plays Bob, a person whose life was destroyed by testicular cancer who is the protagonist's allie at Remaining Men Together (a support group for men w/ testicular cancer) and eventually joins the somewhat sadistic yet therapeudic ring of fight club.This movie is destined to be a classic.

After thinking about it for awhile, I really do like  it and plan on ordering it.  What so many critics just do not understand is  that the movie is not about a bunch of guys releasing their anger and  tension by fighting: it is a very important warning to our society and how  it is so wrapped up in materialism and consumerism that it is basically  dead.  The acting was amazing: boy, has Brad Pitt really come a long way  from his Cool World and Thelma and Louise days--he was absolutely wonderful  as the psychotic Tyler Durden.

518863,A2PXHFGJZBNLXB,B00003CWQ2,Kenji Fujishima,"[12, 13]","I had heard so much about David Fincher's popular 1999 film FIGHT CLUB that I felt that I owed myself to see what the big deal about this movie was about. Now that I have, my personal reaction can be summed up in this way: I respect the film's skill and style, but how were so many people sucked into swallowing this film whole?Yes, this film is very well-made. Director David Fincher is a virtuoso film stylist, and he brings his hard-rock style to bear in this film even more than he did with the disturbing SEVEN. It is his unrelenting but occasionally exciting style, as well as the good performances by Edward Norton and Brad Pitt, that carries you along through most of the movie: this is a movie that vibrates with fever and energy, and the first half-hour of the movie really does draw you into the Narrator's dead-end life. (The cinematography by Jeff Cronenweth is often strikingly gritty.) And it must be said that FIGHT CLUB is never boring. How can you be bored by a movie that is as unremittingly violent, both physically and mentally, than this one? Or with Brad Pitt's character, Tyler Durden, spouting off his magnetically anarchic gospel, telling us to rebel against all the lies we've been fed by, I guess, ""the establishment""? In its own way, FIGHT CLUB is a gripping visceral achievement.And yet, what does all this blood-stained machismo add up to in the end? To a blinding revelation that supposedly sheds new light on all that has gone before, and yet simply seems like something screenwriter Jim Uhls, adapting Chuck Palahniuk's book (which I haven't read), thought might be cool to throw in, following the lead of Christopher McQuarrie's big twist in THE USUAL SUSPECTS. But even that controversial twist seemed more, not less, convincing! Did people really actually take this film's big twist SERIOUSLY? Did they really buy it as easily as they apparently did? I shared Edward Norton's disbelief during the final stages: I wouldn't have believed it either.It is really a shame the filmmakers here felt that they had to manipulate the audience in this manner (although apparently, based on this film's popularity, they succeeded). If FIGHT CLUB had been less concerned with plot tricks than with Norton's character and how he gets out of the rut he feels he's in with his life, this film might have been an immeasurably better film. For me, all the graphic violence and, later, the fascism of this film really blunted whatever message Fincher and Uhls are trying to convey here. I seriously cannot tell whether this film is meant to be an attack of Tyler Durden's gleeful anarchy or a celebration, so explicit and indulgent this movie is regarding the violence it purports to condemn. Really, this film would have been a lot more disturbing if FIGHT CLUB had focused on the Narrator and the changes he makes in his sad life, instead of being merely ugly and muddled.As it is, FIGHT CLUB is an unfortunate mess of interesting ideas about rebelling against society buried under a lot of impressive filmmaking style and a lot of brutal violence. David Fincher is undoubtedly a talented filmmaker---his 1995 film SEVEN was an equally grisly but much more disturbingly effective serial-killer thriller---but this film is basically a triumph of style over substance. Though never boring, it is at heart a very stupid macho movie, and I am amazed that more people haven't seen right through its intellectual pretensions.

This is a complex, layered, multi faceted plot delivered in a crisp visually stunning manner.This isn't ""just"" a movie about guys who fight to get out their frustrations, that's like saying Jaws was about fishing.  Alongside the biting social commentary and the primal macho juice, is a parable about losing yourself in your own problems, lying to yourself for as long as you can, realizing it, and seeing the effects it has on everyone around you.  What's great is all of these pieces, a wounded romance, anti-boss revenge, triumphal combat, a devoted personality cult, can be appreciated as individual bits and scenes, but still work together to advance the story arc.Even setting aside the very original plot, the movie itself is just great to look at.

518889,A79Q8J5DAG55N,B00003CWQ2,kyle porter,"[3, 5]","This has got to be my favorite movie ever made. It's sounds extremely  cliche; a man's praise for a superficially masculine,  testosterone-drenched, wham-bam-thank you ma'am pile of celluloid. Not at  all true. This film made me think, and no movie fitting the preceding  description has ever accomplished that. This film also shocked me with  frank but intelligant philosophy, stunning performances credited to Helena  Bonham Carter and Edward Norton, and original-ironically trendy-premise and  execution. The sensationalism, assumed to be horribly adolescent, is so  effective, the audience is left gathering itself and arriving to the  conclusion that while it may have its share of violence, slapstick,  shockers, and bizarre mannerisms, there was a lot to think about in all  that. You can thank this film for the strangest slice of a reality gone  reanimated, as a nameless Joe Average plunges into a tale of mischeif,  mayhem, and soap. Edward Norton is the timid white-collar consumer, a  simple materialist with an addiction to stuff he doesn't need but buys to  fill holes in his pathetic, numbing existence, like anyone else would.  Stricken with the boredom of office jargon and despondency, while suffering  heavy insomnia, Norton finds an obscure comfort, and pitiful just as well,  touring support groups for diseases and what not, releasing tears and his  sleeping restraints. while this is all well and good, his encounter with  the vivaciously-dead Helena Bonham Carter lands him back in square one,  resolving to his new (single-serving) friend: Tyler Durden. Enigmatic,  rebellious, confident, vulgar, unconventional, and smart, Tyler (Brad Pitt)  leads his pal into a foreign world of obscure humor, the dangers of  soap-making, the philosophy of chaos and anti-sociality, theraputic  violence, and taking action against the ideals of the material world that  chains us all.

This film  is so disgustingly subversive and the &quot;values&quot; that it promotes  are so twisted and subhuman that one can only hope that the audience would  dismiss it as a mere &quot;contrived and forgettable heap of dung&quot;,  rather than taking it's &quot;revolutionary spirit&quot; too  seriously.As I watched this film I felt nauseous most of the time and  left the theater feeling very disoriented.  In general I don't object to  violence in a film, but this one had a particularly sadistic attitude.  I  would not recommend this film to anyone (especially male children).

I'm a fan of the old Ultimate Fighting Championship, when they used to slam each other in the head with elbows and the blood would flow,  so I'm not in the least offended by the blood in Fight Club.  I thought  this was going to be a straight ahead movie about some regular guys forming  a fight club to experience knocking each other's brains in, to get the  adrenaline rush, to see how good you were in something fairly close to a  street fight, though of course not a street fight since both contestants  agree in advance to show up, and a measure of safety from eye gauges and  death is assumed.  I did something like this myself when I started a  Brazilian Jiu Jitsu club where people went full tilt, though no punching  was allowed, just &quot;wrestling&quot;, more like submission wrestling.  But that is not what the movie is primarily about.  It is just one of the  macho images the protagonist has flying around in his head.  The movie  isn't about a fight club.  It's about the meanderings in the mind of the  protagonist, who isn't planted firmly on the ground.  The movie held my  interest but I found it too long and at times too wierd.  The robotic fight  club members were a bit too much.  One man's insanity is another man's  cult.  I think this movie would have worked better for me if they had kept  it simpler, as in Keep It Simple Stupid.  The bizarre and unbelievable  directions they took it in lost me.  Try editing it next time.  Change the  focus.  Make it real.  I hadn't realized I was watching sci fi or fantasy.  You have a good concept here.  Just rein it in and give it some focus.  This slop is all over the place.  What's that about the girl?  What's that  about the political messages?  Huh?  What are you doing?  Sorry, it really  doesn't come together as an artistic whole for me.  It needs a ruthless  editor to pare it down a half hour, and it would benefit from some reality.

With the combination of action, dark humor/satire, drama, a bit of adventure, and wicked turns on love and heartbreak, this movie tests the boundaries over critics and other directors.  David Fincher, who also did SE7EN (THUMBS UP), The Game, and Alien3 (his first movie feature), Fincher has proven himself worthy of being one of the greatest directors after improving his skills of the rather dissapointing, last film, of the Alien franchise.  You have Brad Pitt, who is a loose cannon in the act of proving his ""friend"" that he is everything he is not as he FIGHTS his way through his own problems throughout the movie.  You have Edward Norton, who is referred to as 'Jack', making up his imaginary friend, Tyler Durden, to help him become...Shall we say, stronger as he tries to find out that HE WAS Tyler Durden through all of his kicking and screaming with Tyler Durden.  Other characters, such as Jared Leto (Angel Face) and Meat Load Aday (Robert Pulsen), play more smaller roles, but Meat Loaf's character helped make Fight Club hilarious in the most sickest ways.  I remember reading about how many bad reviews Fight Club got (The Collector's Edition has a thick booklet with most of them).  Some of them were funny and some of them simply tore the movie in half.  David Fincher gave no apologies to how offensive the movie got towards some issues and towards other questionable parts of the movie...If I was the director, I would've given no apologies either cause Fight Club was an excellent movie to watch and witness and was definitely a breakthrough for Fincher, along with Pitt and Norton.",5,An incendiary bomb that explodes in your face,1138233600,"01 26, 2006",2006,1713,"['Fight', 'Club', 'many', 'years', 'now', 'been', 'one', 'movies', 'many', 'genre', 'movie-making', 'combination', 'action', 'dark', 'humor/satire', 'drama', 'bit', 'adventure', 'wicked', 'turns', 'love', 'heartbreak', 'movie', 'boundaries', 'critics', 'other', 'directors', 'David', 'Fincher', 'who', 'also', 'did', 'SE7EN', 'THUMBS', 'UP', 'Game', 'Alien3', 'first', 'movie', 'feature', 'Fincher', 'proven', 'worthy', 'being', 'one', 'greatest', 'directors', 'improving', 'skills', 'rather', 'dissapointing', 'last', 'film', 'Alien', 'franchise', 'have', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'who', 'loose', 'cannon', 'act', 'proving', 'friend', 'everything', 'not', 'way', 'own', 'problems', 'movie', 'have', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'who', 'referred', ""'Jack"", 'making', 'up', 'imaginary', 'friend', 'Tyler', 'Durden', 'help', 'become', 'Shall', 'say', 'stronger', 'find', 'out', 'HE', 'WAS', 'Tyler', 'Durden', 'kicking', 'screaming', 'Tyler', 'Durden', 'Other', 'characters', 'such', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'Angel', 'Face', 'Meat', 'Load', 'Aday', 'Robert', 'Pulsen', 'play', 'more', 'smaller', 'roles', 'Meat', 'Loaf', 'character', 'helped', 'make', 'Fight', 'Club', 'hilarious', 'most', 'sickest', 'ways', 'remember', 'reading', 'how', 'many', 'bad', 'reviews', 'Fight', 'Club', 'got', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'thick', 'booklet', 'most', 'were', 'funny', 'simply', 'tore', 'movie', 'half', 'David', 'Fincher', 'gave', 'apologies', 'how', 'offensive', 'movie', 'got', 'towards', 'issues', 'towards', 'other', 'questionable', 'parts', 'movie', 'was', 'director', 'would', ""'ve"", 'given', 'apologies', 'cause', 'Fight', 'Club', 'was', 'excellent', 'movie', 'watch', 'witness', 'was', 'definitely', 'breakthrough', 'Fincher', 'Pitt', 'Norton']",N/A

It kept me intrigued for its full 140 minutes and when it was over I thought about it for a long time.Edward Norton stars as the unnamed narrator who cannot find peace in his life in spite of his perfectly furnished condo.  Brad Pitt plays the charismatic bad boy Tyler Durden, who changes the narrator's perspective forever.  Together they form a fight club, an underground support group for disaffected males who pummel each other into ecstatic enlightenment.  It's a twisted black comedy that intensifies in its violence and its meaning.Ed Norton is one of the finest actors around today and it's amazing that he didn't receive an academy award nomination for this role.  He acts with his whole body, knowing just when to wince or open his eyes in rounded wonder. We see his character shift back and forth, experience pain, pleasure and fear as well as all the nuances of emotion that a human being is capable of.Brad Pitt's performance is more one dimensional but he also gives a fine performance.  And Helena Bonlam Carter as the chain-smoking woman in their lives has a small but significant role.I tried to read the novel by Chuck Palahuniuk several years ago but never got past the first chapter.  I found it dark and depressing and hard to follow.  However, as a screenplay and assisted by the writing skills of Jim Uhls, this wordy and strange novel takes on a whole new life.  David Fincher, the director,  brilliantly shot the fight sequences shadowed in darkness, but still full of blood and gore.There's a surprise at the end of Fight Club which was very much in context with the plot although it takes the viewer into a different sense of reality.  It certainly  made me want to view the film again to catch all the little hints that must have been dropped along the way and that I missed.  I couldn't help thinking about it later and I expect I will continue to do so for a long time.This is a quirky, twisted and dark film recommended only for those who are willing to experience some uncomfortable moments.

518902,A3BXS0A7CMJ1CJ,B00003CWQ2,linus,"[13, 21]","In FIGHT CLUB, the self-consciously ""daring"" adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's excellent cult novel, men assemble and pound one another in dank basements; they spit blood and teeth and then return for more next  week. When this isn't enough for them, they wage war on our consumerist  culture with media-friendly, attention-getting pranks that escalate into  mass destruction. I bought all this in the book, because Palahniuk's  fevered first-person narration puts you inside the exhausted rage of  powerless young men who are sick of it all. A movie, however, can be a  delicate animal, and this one begins boldly and gradually dies.What  happened? The screenplay, by first-timer Jim Uhls, is pretty loyal to the  novel; the Narrator, a nameless corporate drudge played by Edward Norton,  delivers many of the book's best lines in sarcastic voice-over. But -- and  here I must step very lightly in order to avoid major spoilers -- what  worked on the page, especially the credibility-stretching plot twist, comes  off labored on the screen. Readers of the book may sit there wondering how  director David Fincher (SE7EN) will sustain the illusion from scene to  scene. Newcomers, in turn, may wonder why many of the scenes are so  stilted, with characters entering and exiting as in a screwball play. And  when the surprise is sprung, nobody in the audience so much as  gasps.Certain images, certain surrealistically funny bits of  business, occasionally made me think ""I really must buy this on DVD,"" which  is in hilarious counterpoint to the anti-consumerist message the movie is  selling. Reading the book, I wasn't thinking about DVDs. Palahniuk made you  ponder the lost masculinity of a generation, the ease with which a  charismatic brute like Tyler can assemble disgruntled men and unite them in  chaos. The book is a modern horror story about how populist fascism can  flourish here, and about why this is the perfect time for it. (The detail  of soap made of human fat is no accident.) The movie, unfortunately, is a  stylish blank, a countercultural advertisement just as slick as the ads it  claims to disdain. The last reel, which departs from the book and gives us  movie-ish thrills we've seen a hundred times before, is about as saddening  a commentary on Hollywood as any I've witnessed. What's even sadder is that  those involved with FIGHT CLUB think they've made something scathing and  radical, and that some viewers might agree with them.",2,You can understand this movie and still not like it much,964396800,"07 24, 2000",2000,2460,"['FIGHT', 'CLUB', 'self-consciously', 'daring', 'adaptation', 'Chuck', 'Palahniuk', 'excellent', 'cult', 'novel', 'men', 'assemble', 'pound', 'one', 'dank', 'basements', 'spit', 'blood', 'teeth', 'then', 'return', 'more', 'next', 'week', 'When', ""n't"", 'enough', 'wage', 'war', 'consumerist', 'culture', 'media-friendly', 'attention-getting', 'pranks', 'escalate', 'mass', 'destruction', 'bought', 'book', 'Palahniuk', 'fevered', 'first-person', 'narration', 'exhausted', 'rage', 'powerless', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'sick', 'movie', 'however', 'can', 'be', 'delicate', 'animal', 'one', 'boldly', 'gradually', 'dies.What', 'happened', 'screenplay', 'first-timer', 'Jim', 'Uhls', 'pretty', 'loyal', 'novel', 'Narrator', 'nameless', 'corporate', 'drudge', 'played', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'many', 'book', 'best', 'lines', 'sarcastic', 'voice-over', 'here', 'must', 'step', 'very', 'lightly', 'order', 'avoid', 'major', 'spoilers', 'what', 'worked', 'page', 'especially', 'credibility-stretching', 'plot', 'twist', 'off', 'labored', 'screen', 'Readers', 'book', 'may', 'sit', 'wondering', 'how', 'director', 'David', 'Fincher', 'SE7EN', 'will', 'sustain', 'illusion', 'scene', 'scene', 'Newcomers', 'turn', 'may', 'wonder', 'why', 'many', 'scenes', 'are', 'so', 'stilted', 'characters', 'entering', 'exiting', 'screwball', 'play', 'when', 'surprise', 'sprung', 'nobody', 'audience', 'so', 'much', 'gasps.Certain', 'images', 'certain', 'surrealistically', 'funny', 'bits', 'business', 'occasionally', 'made', 'think', 'really', 'must', 'buy', 'DVD', 'hilarious', 'counterpoint', 'anti-consumerist', 'message', 'movie', 'selling', 'Reading', 'book', 'was', ""n't"", 'thinking', 'DVDs', 'Palahniuk', 'made', 'ponder', 'lost', 'masculinity', 'generation', 'ease', 'charismatic', 'brute', 'Tyler', 'can', 'assemble', 'disgruntled', 'men', 'unite', 'chaos', 'book', 'modern', 'horror', 'story', 'how', 'populist', 'fascism', 'can', 'flourish', 'here', 'about', 'why', 'perfect', 'time', 'detail', 'soap', 'made', 'human', 'fat', 'accident', 'movie', 'unfortunately', 'stylish', 'blank', 'countercultural', 'advertisement', 'just', 'as', 'slick', 'ads', 'disdain', 'last', 'reel', 'book', 'movie-ish', 'thrills', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'hundred', 'times', 'saddening', 'commentary', 'Hollywood', ""'ve"", 'witnessed', 'What', 'even', 'sadder', 'involved', 'FIGHT', 'CLUB', 'think', ""'ve"", 'made', 'something', 'scathing', 'radical', 'viewers', 'might', 'agree']",N/A

No weapons, no team-ups, no refs, just old-fashioned, one-on-one fistfights.  The main rule in Fight Club is that you can't talk about it.Ed Norton plays a timid, insomniac auto recall investigator who goes to medical support groups to feel better about himself and get some sleep.  He meets Marla, a woman with similar low self-esteem.  Marla is also a support-group junkie.  Right away, he dislikes her intensely, and they start arguing.He meets Tyler when his condo is mysteriously blown up.  Lost without his Ikea furniture, he moves in with Tyler.  The two start the club.Based on the book of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk, Fight Club (his first novel - wow!) is different from any other movie out there.

Still, FIGHT CLUB remains  a rarity: a thinking person's film.

Hines,"[11, 14]","If it weren't for the fact that The Matrix was also released in 1999, I would have no problem saying that this was the best film of that year.  At this point, I feel that these two films must share that honor, as both were ground breaking on multiple levels.Fight Club is primarily a pitch black comedy, as someone mentions on one of the four commentary tracks included in the DVD.  Some people will understand the comedy and enjoy it.  Others, like my wife, will not.  This is the only movie that I've asked  her to watch that she would not finish.  About half way thru, she said she was done and walked out.  This film is a wild roller coaster ride, and as with the real thing, it will thrill and excite some, while just making others sick.The level of detail in Fight Club is remarkable.  Finding all the subliminal Tyler's is just the begining.  For example, Ricky (the kid who couldn't remember if he had ordered pens with blue ink or black), is in the scene where &quot;Jack&quot; is leaving his office for the last time, with blood all over his face, and a shopping cart filled with computer equipment, being escorted by security.  Ricky recognizes &quot;Jack&quot; and just has this wonderful smile appear on his face that looks like a combination of surprise, delight, and respect.  This happens in the edge of the frame for a second or less.  David Fincher was definately thinking about the DVD crowd when he put this masterpiece together.What can I say about the 2-DVD set that hasn't already been said?  It is spectacular.  The extras are fantastic, not just a bunch of lame schetches (although it includes these too for those who enjoy them).  There are numerous deleted scenes, and all of the behind the scenes stuff is actual video footage, not stills.Just for completeness, this movie is not about fighting.  It is about being so numbed by the blandness and meaninglessness of life in the 90's that the only thing that can get your attention is having the living crap kicked out of you.  It's about how easily some people are led.  It's about trying to find your place in a world that doesn't make sense.  It's about coping with your father walking out on you when you were 6 years old.  And of course, it's about how stress can result in a fractured personality.As for the violence in the file, it's not the kind of violence that you are probably used to.  For example, only one person dies in this film.  Compare that to &quot;The Terminator&quot;, or any number of other films where lots of people die.  I think there are two key aspects to the violence in this film that disturb people.  First, the depection of a couple of the beatings is pretty graphic, and the makeup work is very realistic.  Also, the sound effects of the punches are superbly realistic.  Second, other people are shown during a couple of beatings, and they are clearly very disturbed by what they are witnessing.  It is normal human psychology to take emotional cues from others, and the emotional cues coming from the other actors make it clear that you are supposed to be very disturbed by the events that are transpiring.

I won't even get too much involved in the plot, which is surreal and not without its share of twists and turns. A lot of what this movie is about is these frustrated emotionally-numb men realizing that the world we all live in (9-5 jobs, wives, kids, IKEA, Starbucks...) has robbed them of thier ability to feel anything, along with any dreams they once had.  They connect to their primal rage in some of the most awesomely graphic bare knuckle fighting you'll see in a movie...Fight Club. Once they start the club they open a whole can of worms; the fighting almost becomes addictive, and they eventually begin to look at the world like a pack of wolves watching a herd of sheep.There is a whole mess more going on in the movie that I'll leave for you to get to yourself; sex, violence, morals, insanity, space monkeys and making soap to name a few. I've been a solid fan of both Norton and Pitt since they made this flick and it sits as kind of a perfect little treasure out of the late nineties.

It was touted as representing the anger and consciousness of the X generation, and maybe it does. But this story about an alienated loser who creates a violent cult of similarly inclined young men who weekly beat each other up and then plot to destroy society's institutions, although perhaps not great, is still pretty good. It's also reminiscent of the movie, Crash, based on the J.G. Ballard novel, in its theme of a repressed and narcissistic culture of violence that lies just beneath the surface of our otherwise highly polished, technologically advanced society, an interesting idea. There are some good scenes in the movie, but some of them didn't quite hit the mark. But Ed Norton is a fine actor, and he turns in an excellent performance here, and he is certainly one of our best up-and-coming young stars.

From what society is told to value, and in a lot of cases pointing out the obsurdity of many things; even things like good soap. Edward Norton who's the narrator talks a lot at the beginning about what he does for a job, checking his companies accidents incase they need a recall. Whether he really dislikes this or not is left to the viewer. Insomnia plays a really big part of his life, and lot's of air travel for his job. He explains how he likes arranging and buying furniture to match a catalog, it makes him feel better.One day the narrator decides to go to a help group, where his first time he meets Bob played by Meat Loaf. A somewhat strange character Meat Loaf plays. The narrator finds that he sleeps easier that night, so he goes to many different help groups contuing to sleep everynight.One day when he is flying on a plane for his job, he meets Tyler Durden played by Brad Pitt. This is where the story takes a dramatic turn for the narrator's life. Tyler is not a polite guy, and seems to disapprove of Ed's character. They have an interesting conversation though, one of the many flaws with that he sees with socities ways. The oxygen masks aboard airplanes he says are uses to calm people, getting a high; though not really protecting you at all.After the plane trip and the meeting with Tyler, he finds his condo room burned from an explosion. So he uses a card with Tyler's number, a soap company business card. They talk in at a bar for awhile, and Tyler says just ask me already if you need a place to stay. From out of nowhere Tyler gets the narrator to hit him. Then they fight out in a parking lot.The narrator seems almost relaxed more after the fight, his attitude already is changing from the time he first meet on Tyler on the plane.It's interesting to see Norton's character change, his condo room burning the only place he found an outlet from his job has him needing something else. Tyler introduces him to what he finds is really important, and it's not the way the narrator's life is. The both of them make an underground fight club, which Tyler tells all members to not tell anyone as a strict rule of joining. A lot of people from different classes of living join, you get the feeling they were seeking something different, their lives somehow not forfilled. Not unlike our narrator. The fight club forms groups of a different sort later on in the movie.I like all of issues brought up in the movie, of valuing material possessions that can get the point of the only thing in some people's lives, feminising men to the point of no dignity, raised by single mothers being normal, not going for your real goals if they take along time to get there. These issues usually aren't popular to bring up in any movie, quite the opposite. The humor is also great at some points. The story is ever changing, not knowing where they're going next.

518924,A3NM0RAYSL6PA8,B00003CWQ2,"Maine Writer ""David""","[6, 8]","There are moments when Fight Club loses its pace; when moments drag.  Put aside this one flaw, and put it aside you must, and you're left with a piercingly intelligent deconstruction of modern life.  It is a movie perched on an overhang, with just enough height and distance to give a snarling, infuriariting perspective on a society that has turned us into docile husks.  Ever feel that sinking emptiness inside, the hollow, clawing demise of your soul?  Ever wish the plane you were on would crash, putting you and a couple of other hundred meaningless lives to rest?  Fight Club tells us why it is so important to live, and what it means to take control of your life and scream to the heavens that you matter.  Even if you don't.That's where Fight Club begins for it's lead character; a man trapped, looking for a way out, knowing that he can't escape it alone.  He needs a hero; a savant; an angel.  And into his life walks Tyler Durden, a roaming, phantasmagorical Christ figure, ready to grab him by the neck and beat him into consciousness.  I don't want to tell you more, but rest assured that the dialogue is crisp, insightful, and wonderfully real.  The story is crystalline, full of metaphor, nuance, and irony.  It is also breathtakingly violent, showing us how much we all need the equivalent of a sharp, short, shock to the face, to spit a few teeth into the sink, to feel the sting of lye burning through skin, through sinew, into bone.  Pain may be the most real thing we have.  It's the only thing that may make us listen--to ourselves and others.Edward Norton and Brad Pitt shine, but so do the rest of the actors.

518925,A2TBMX78M7PD5T,B00003CWQ2,"Malvolio ""scott15724""","[1, 1]","Synopsis: A young auto industry analyst finds an antidote to the boredom and emptiness of his life by participating in a brutal underground sport called Fight Club. As more and more disaffected men begin setting up clubs in urban centers everywhere, the movement takes a sinister turn, ultimately expressing itself in apocalyptic violence.Fight Club includes a surprise twist that may make you think of other movies like The Sixth Sense or The Crying Game. But the surprise here is not built in with the cleverness and subtlety of The Sixth Sense - you won't be tempted, for instance, to go winding back through the movie trying to find clues. And that's all right: because while The Sixth Sense gets its creepy power from subtlety and sophistication, Fight Club's calling cards are brutality, attitude and corrosive humor. Like the desperate contestants in the pastime that gives the movie its name, Fight Club throws a fusillade of punches hoping that enough of them will land to make it a winner. Ultimately it succeeds.The story's narrator (Edward Norton) is a twentysomething who investigates auto accidents for his employer, an unnamed car company. It's his job to calculate whether enough consumers will die horrible deaths as a result of the automobiles' defects to make it financially worthwhile for the company to initiate recalls. Not surprisingly, the young man has trouble sleeping; he spends his bouts of insomnia poring over catalogs from places like Ikea, compulsively furnishing his apartment in a quest for emotional satisfaction. For a while he finds some human comfort by frequenting cancer and disease support groups, feigning illness in order to connect with the other attendees - but that's ruined when the groups are infiltrated by another ""tourist,"" played to cynical perfection by Helena Bonham-Carter. Finally, on one of his frequent business trips, the narrator encounters a challenging, wildly unconventional soap salesman named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) - and his life takes a radical turn.The core of Fight Club is the tension between the charismatic Tyler Durden, a nihilist whose antisocial behavior spins ever more perilously out of control, and the narrator, an ambivalent character with one foot in the fight clubs and the other still in the button-down world of corporate conventionalism. Edward Norton does a beautiful job with the lead role, convincingly embodying both sides of the conflicted young man; he provides the movie with its emotional core, and holds his own even when sharing the screen with his incandescent costars. Pitt gives the film its ferocious energy and sense of danger, in much the same way Tom Cruise lit up an earlier Brad Pitt movie, Interview With the Vampire. For the part of the hard-bitten, consumptive looking Marla, Bonham-Carter provides just enough vulnerability to make her sympathetic by the movie's end without compromising her character.Insofar as it focuses on the narrator's eccentric quest for human connection, Fight Club is a brilliant film. The metaphor of reaching out and touching other human beings with a bloody fist is not only inspired satire - it is oddly fitting as an emblem of our culture's increasing social clumsiness. (The only way to break through anyone's carapace of possessions, arm's-length communication devices and 21st century intellectual reserve is to beat his head against a concrete floor.) Unfortunately, the movie eventually runs short of material in the fight clubs and shifts its attention to ""Project Mayhem"" - wherein Tyler Durden's nihilistic vision becomes the linchpin of an improbably vast underground movement. At this point, Fight Club loses its power and focus. It is also around this time in the film that we are let in on the surprise I mentioned at the outset. Although the surprise does shed interesting light on the character of the narrator, it doesn't manage to save the last twenty minutes or so of plot development. Despite its faults, though, Fight Club is well worth seeing. Its rawness, edgy humor, and exciting performances easily compensate for the late failures of the plot.",4,Fight Club delivers a TKO,1027468800,"07 24, 2002",2002,4108,"['Synopsis', 'young', 'auto', 'industry', 'analyst', 'antidote', 'boredom', 'emptiness', 'life', 'participating', 'brutal', 'underground', 'sport', 'called', 'Fight', 'Club', 'more', 'more', 'disaffected', 'men', 'begin', 'setting', 'up', 'clubs', 'urban', 'centers', 'everywhere', 'movement', 'sinister', 'turn', 'ultimately', 'expressing', 'apocalyptic', 'violence.Fight', 'Club', 'surprise', 'twist', 'may', 'make', 'think', 'other', 'movies', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Crying', 'Game', 'surprise', 'here', 'not', 'built', 'cleverness', 'subtlety', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'tempted', 'instance', 'go', 'winding', 'back', 'movie', 'trying', 'find', 'clues', 'right', 'because', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'creepy', 'power', 'subtlety', 'sophistication', 'Fight', 'Club', 'calling', 'cards', 'are', 'brutality', 'attitude', 'corrosive', 'humor', 'desperate', 'contestants', 'pastime', 'movie', 'name', 'Fight', 'Club', 'fusillade', 'punches', 'hoping', 'enough', 'will', 'land', 'make', 'winner', 'Ultimately', 'story', 'narrator', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'twentysomething', 'who', 'auto', 'accidents', 'employer', 'unnamed', 'car', 'company', 'job', 'calculate', 'enough', 'consumers', 'will', 'die', 'horrible', 'deaths', 'result', 'automobiles', 'defects', 'make', 'financially', 'company', 'initiate', 'recalls', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'young', 'man', 'trouble', 'sleeping', 'bouts', 'insomnia', 'poring', 'catalogs', 'places', 'Ikea', 'compulsively', 'furnishing', 'apartment', 'quest', 'emotional', 'satisfaction', 'while', 'human', 'comfort', 'frequenting', 'cancer', 'disease', 'support', 'groups', 'feigning', 'illness', 'order', 'connect', 'other', 'attendees', 'ruined', 'when', 'groups', 'are', 'infiltrated', 'tourist', 'played', 'cynical', 'perfection', 'Helena', 'Bonham-Carter', 'Finally', 'one', 'frequent', 'business', 'trips', 'narrator', 'challenging', 'wildly', 'unconventional', 'soap', 'salesman', 'named', 'Tyler', 'Durden', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'life', 'radical', 'turn.The', 'core', 'Fight', 'Club', 'tension', 'charismatic', 'Tyler', 'Durden', 'nihilist', 'antisocial', 'behavior', 'spins', 'ever', 'more', 'perilously', 'control', 'narrator', 'ambivalent', 'character', 'one', 'foot', 'fight', 'clubs', 'other', 'still', 'button-down', 'world', 'corporate', 'conventionalism', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'beautiful', 'job', 'lead', 'role', 'convincingly', 'embodying', 'sides', 'conflicted', 'young', 'man', 'movie', 'emotional', 'core', 'own', 'even', 'when', 'sharing', 'screen', 'incandescent', 'costars', 'Pitt', 'film', 'ferocious', 'energy', 'sense', 'danger', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'lit', 'up', 'earlier', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'movie', 'Interview', 'Vampire', 'part', 'hard-bitten', 'consumptive', 'looking', 'Marla', 'Bonham-Carter', 'just', 'enough', 'vulnerability', 'make', 'sympathetic', 'movie', 'end', 'compromising', 'character.Insofar', 'narrator', 'eccentric', 'quest', 'human', 'connection', 'Fight', 'Club', 'brilliant', 'film', 'metaphor', 'reaching', 'out', 'touching', 'other', 'human', 'beings', 'bloody', 'fist', 'not', 'only', 'inspired', 'satire', 'oddly', 'fitting', 'emblem', 'culture', 'increasing', 'social', 'clumsiness', 'only', 'way', 'break', 'anyone', 'carapace', 'possessions', ""arm's-length"", 'communication', 'devices', '21st', 'century', 'intellectual', 'reserve', 'beat', 'head', 'concrete', 'floor', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'eventually', 'short', 'material', 'fight', 'clubs', 'shifts', 'attention', 'Project', 'Mayhem', 'wherein', 'Tyler', 'Durden', 'nihilistic', 'vision', 'linchpin', 'improbably', 'vast', 'underground', 'movement', 'point', 'Fight', 'Club', 'power', 'focus', 'also', 'time', 'film', 'are', 'let', 'surprise', 'mentioned', 'outset', 'surprise', 'shed', 'interesting', 'light', 'character', 'narrator', ""n't"", 'manage', 'save', 'last', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'so', 'plot', 'development', 'faults', 'though', 'Fight', 'Club', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'rawness', 'edgy', 'humor', 'exciting', 'performances', 'easily', 'compensate', 'late', 'failures', 'plot']",N/A

Instead, I was riveted, amused, and left quite shaken by the experience &quot;Fight Club&quot; unleashed upon me--so much so I saw it two more times in the theaters before it was unfairly scuttled into limbo.  David Fincher is simply the most exciting, risk-taking director working in mainstream Hollywood, and it really surprises me that a major studio was willing to shell out big bucks on a project this risky.  Unfortunately, a lot of people didn't see the same movie I did, which caused a short theatrical run.Brad Pitt and Edward Norton make an incredible team here, and it's good to see Helena Bonham Carter playing a characer without an English accent.The way the movie indicts materialism as a form of security and satisfaction is a statement more true than many figures in Hollywood are willing to accept, no doubt.  Norton's anonymous everyman is easily accessible for comparison with ourselves, and his deadpan narration perfectly encompasses his losing fight with the modern world as his sanity drifts.  Pitt's Tyler Durden is an all-id misfit that's really the highlight of this &quot;pretty boy's&quot; career, because the character runs against his image.The filmmaking technique is dazzling despite its considerable grunge (a Fincher trademark).  A lot of scenes are carried out with incredible innovation and originality in &quot;Fight Club&quot; (Norton's direct-to-camera explanations, wobbling film stock, subliminal images, etc.) as opposed to a normal Hollywood film that would merely do something in a derivative way to get it over with.All in all, if you allow &quot;Fight Club&quot; to suck you in, you'll go away from the movie shaken, high, and absolutely exhilarated.

518933,AY2WLFER9C9A,B00003CWQ2,"Mark Schaefer ""themarkman99""","[3, 5]","A bracing, mesmerizing, bitterly funny and deeply unsettling fable about disaffected, emotionally emasculated young men whose search for meaning leads straight to their inner bare-knuckle brawler. Fight Club is the brain child--make that brainless, testosterone-fueled gut child--of scruffy wild boy Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) and a nameless, insomniac cubicle slave (Edward Norton). They meet on a plane, bond over the coincidence that they're carrying the exact same briefcase (though Tyler's is full of the chi-chi soap he sells to high-end boutiques, while our office peon's bag is packed with papers.) A freak accident blows our protagonist's tastefully appointed apartment to kingdon come and propels him first into Tyler's pestilent house on the industrial side of town, and then into a bloody, sweaty journey of self-discovery that never goes quite where you think it's going. Faithfully adabted from Chuck Palahniuk's novel, Fincher's film is a brilliantly realized series of sucker punches, a philosophical howl disguised as a muscular guy movie. Neither Palahniuk nor Fincher is onto anything new: The plight of the post-feminist, post-war generation of men without fathers, coming-of-age rituals or meaningful jobs launched the Iron John movement and keeps an army of therapists in clover. But Palahniuk nails the searing alienation and directs it into something simultaneously horrifying and logical (not for nothing is he regularly campared to J.G.

It was filled with wonderful performances and interesting twists in the plot.  The movie is about an insomniac, played by Edward Nortion.  Because Edward Norton's character is never named, I will call him ""Ed"".  Ed is only able to go to sleep, once he has had a good cry.  So, he goes to depressing groups filled with men that are dying of cancer.  All of a sudden, a creepy woman, Marla (Helena Bonham Carter), starts going to these groups, which annoys Ed very much and it prevents him from sleeping.  Later on, while on a plane, Ed meets Tyler(Brad Pitt) and eventually moves in with Tyler because his house was burnt down.Later on, while fighting, Tyler and Ed find out that fighting really helps them let out their emotions and helps them sleep as well.  As a result, they start a secret club called ""fight club"", in which random men attend to fight eachother and let out their anger.  The club becomes very popular, and the men in the group form a sort of cult.  In this cult, the men start ""project mayhem"" in which they cause trouble around the world.One day, Tyler is gone, which leaves Ed alone with the cult and project mayhem.  Ed can't handle all that pressure, so he leaves and looks for Tyler.  For some weird reason, everyone keeps mistaking Ed for Tyler.  I'm not going to give anymore of the story away.

518941,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00003CWQ2,Matthew Horner,"[4, 5]","Denounced by several key critics and avoided by many moviegoers, Fight Club has seemingly found its audience on DVD. Pardon the pun, but its a knockout of a movie. Violent? Oh, yes. Gratuitous? I don't think so. I can understand the controversy. Violence in society is at the forefront of today's news. I don't think Fight Club is any more pro-violence than Saving Private Ryan is pro-war.Edward Norton plays a character referred to only as The Narrator. I think this was done for two reasons, one of which I can tell you without writing a plot-spoiler. His character is nameless because he has become so alienated and frustrated that he has no identity left. He is the victim of the empty promises of the bourgeois lifestyle that, sadly, so many of us are caught up in today. Many of us work for corporations so vast that they are both faceless and soulless. Never in history have so many material goods been dangled before us, The the more we acquire, the less fulfilled many of us are. As the movie says, sometimes the things we own wind up owning us.One day, The Narrator comes up with a plan. He starts attending support groups for people with various mental and physical afflictions. He thinks he will feel better if he hangs out with those who are worse off than he is. This works until he meets the chain-smoking, neurotic Marla [Helena Bonham Carter], who has the same plan, but for different reasons. After a few weeks, he confronts her and demands that she change her schedule so that she doesn't go to the meetings on the days he does. When she refuses, he sinks back into his personal abyss. Things change when, on a plane flight, he meets Tyler Dane [Brad Pitt]. Forceful, direct and more than a little anarchistic, Tyler is the antithesis of The Narrator. When our character arrives home, he finds his condominium has been destroyed by a mysterious explosion. Not knowing where to turn, he calls Tyler, the only person recently who has made sense to him. He moves into Tyler's derelict house. Soon, the charismatic Tyler commandeers the basement of a seedy bar and transforms it into a fight club, a place where other frustrated males can beat each other senseless. A few months later, there is a string of clubs across America. Tyler becomes a hero of mythic proportions to the members, and The narrator is always right by his side.The idea of a fight club may sound like a testosterone induced hallucination. To a degree, it is, but that's taking the literal approach. Most of director David Fincher's movies are metaphors, and none is more so than Fight Club. Here he gives us a vision of a vast segment of males suffering a mass identity crisis because modern society has rendered them so powerless. The club is make believe. I fear the identity crisis may be real. Of course, beating each senseless doesn't solve their problems, yet there are many examples in history of groups so oppressed that they wind up taking out their frustrations on each other. Regardless of whether of not you agree with Fincher's assessment, the fact remains that this is a brilliant movie.The cast is superb. Norton and Bonham Carter have excelled in everything they have ever done, and Pitt has his best role since Legends of the Fall.",5,I loved this much maligned movie,1016496000,"03 19, 2002",2002,3235,"['Denounced', 'several', 'key', 'critics', 'avoided', 'many', 'moviegoers', 'Fight', 'Club', 'seemingly', 'found', 'audience', 'DVD', 'Pardon', 'pun', 'knockout', 'movie', 'Violent', 'Oh', 'yes', 'Gratuitous', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'can', 'understand', 'controversy', 'Violence', 'society', 'forefront', 'today', 'news', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Fight', 'Club', 'more', 'pro-violence', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'pro-war.Edward', 'Norton', 'character', 'referred', 'only', 'Narrator', 'think', 'was', 'done', 'two', 'reasons', 'one', 'can', 'tell', 'writing', 'plot-spoiler', 'character', 'nameless', 'become', 'so', 'alienated', 'frustrated', 'identity', 'left', 'victim', 'empty', 'promises', 'bourgeois', 'lifestyle', 'sadly', 'so', 'many', 'are', 'caught', 'up', 'today', 'Many', 'work', 'corporations', 'so', 'vast', 'are', 'faceless', 'soulless', 'Never', 'history', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'material', 'goods', 'been', 'dangled', 'more', 'acquire', 'less', 'fulfilled', 'many', 'are', 'movie', 'things', 'own', 'wind', 'up', 'owning', 'us.One', 'day', 'Narrator', 'up', 'plan', 'attending', 'support', 'groups', 'people', 'various', 'mental', 'physical', 'afflictions', 'will', 'feel', 'better', 'out', 'who', 'are', 'worse', 'off', 'chain-smoking', 'neurotic', 'Marla', '[', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', ']', 'who', 'same', 'plan', 'different', 'reasons', 'few', 'weeks', 'change', 'schedule', ""n't"", 'go', 'meetings', 'days', 'When', 'back', 'personal', 'abyss', 'Things', 'change', 'when', 'plane', 'flight', 'Tyler', 'Dane', '[', 'Brad', 'Pitt', ']', 'Forceful', 'direct', 'more', 'little', 'anarchistic', 'Tyler', 'antithesis', 'Narrator', 'When', 'character', 'home', 'condominium', 'been', 'destroyed', 'mysterious', 'explosion', 'Not', 'knowing', 'where', 'turn', 'Tyler', 'only', 'person', 'recently', 'who', 'made', 'sense', 'Tyler', 'derelict', 'house', 'Soon', 'charismatic', 'Tyler', 'basement', 'seedy', 'bar', 'transforms', 'fight', 'club', 'place', 'where', 'other', 'frustrated', 'males', 'can', 'beat', 'other', 'senseless', 'few', 'months', 'later', 'string', 'clubs', 'America', 'Tyler', 'hero', 'mythic', 'proportions', 'members', 'narrator', 'always', 'right', 'side.The', 'idea', 'fight', 'club', 'may', 'sound', 'testosterone', 'induced', 'hallucination', 'degree', 'taking', 'literal', 'approach', 'Most', 'director', 'David', 'Fincher', 'movies', 'are', 'metaphors', 'none', 'more', 'so', 'Fight', 'Club', 'Here', 'vision', 'vast', 'segment', 'males', 'suffering', 'mass', 'identity', 'crisis', 'modern', 'society', 'rendered', 'so', 'powerless', 'club', 'make', 'believe', 'fear', 'identity', 'crisis', 'may', 'be', 'real', 'course', 'beating', 'senseless', ""n't"", 'solve', 'problems', 'yet', 'are', 'many', 'examples', 'history', 'groups', 'so', 'oppressed', 'wind', 'up', 'taking', 'out', 'frustrations', 'other', 'Regardless', 'not', 'agree', 'Fincher', 'assessment', 'fact', 'brilliant', 'movie.The', 'cast', 'superb', 'Norton', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'have', 'excelled', 'everything', 'have', 'ever', 'done', 'Pitt', 'best', 'role', 'Legends', 'Fall']",N/A

I rate it one of my personal favorites, especially the dvd version which comes with so many special features.The movie itself is so incredible due to the plotline, which has you moving in one direction and then throws you such a curve that you'll be blown away.  Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are incredible opposite each other, complimenting each other's different characters.  Norton portrays a bored man living a mundane, routine life that he desperately needs to escape.  Pitt's character provides Norton with that escape, but you'll never guess the way the movie will go once the action starts building.

518945,A3JZ5L52FM318H,B00003CWQ2,"Matthew T. Weflen ""Matthew Weflen""","[13, 16]","The movie: I love Fight Club. It's one of the best American films of the past 20 years. Literate, funny, disturbing, shocking, and endlessly entertaining, it's really without flaw. Thank goodness it got made before 2001, after which a film that lionizes the exploits of a domestic terrorist who plots to destroy buildings could probably have never been made.The performances are all quite good - Edward Norton before he started believing his own press, Brad Pitt, well, being Brad Pitt very well, and Helena Bonham Carter in the perfectly cast role (if not typecast at this point) are the highlights.I'm not going to say much else. If, somehow, you've avoided seeing this movie, I would hate to spoil it for you. It's a must see, plain and simple, up there with the films of Kubrick, Scorsese, and other American cinematic luminaries of the past 50 years.The Blu-Ray:Wow. I was cringing, hoping and praying to the Blu-Ray gods that this one wouldn't be ruined as other films of this vintage have, (such as Gladiator) by a terrible, disrespectful video transfer, loaded with edge enhancement, excessive DNR, and the like.Well, my prayers were answered. A fine, lovely film grain is preserved in this 2.40:1 1080p encode. Detail is very strong, especially in cloth textures. This is a DARK movie, and the blackness is well represented, with deep, rock solid blacks. Shadow detail is great, though, with loads of information present in the shadowy near-black parts of the picture. BE SURE TO CALIBRATE your TV before watching this! You must have your brightness, contrast, and gamma set properly to get the most out of this flick. The color palette of the film, with its sickly greens and browns, and its omnipresent fluorescent lighting, is well-preserved.Fight Club was an early DVD which was very good for its day. This Blu-Ray takes that DVD, smashes it teeth out, rubs its face in the dirt, and urinates on its corpse. The quality of this transfer is close to or equal to that of the best current films today. It really is stunning.Audio is presented in a 5.1 channel DTS-HD soundtrack that works perfectly fine. Much of the film is dialogue heavy, but when the surrounds get churning, they sound great, and do not obscure the dialogue. This is really the main thing I want out of a soundtrack - to not have to constantly adjust the volume while watching the movie. Fight Club succeeds.Extras include 4 commentaries, with everyone from the director to the stars to the author of the original book having a say. The making of and retrospective features are a mix of old and new. I can't tell if all of the extras from the previous disc are present, but at least some of them are. The new stuff is in HD, the old stuff in SD. I must say, the organization of the extras is not great. The menus are a tad confusing, and a lot of small things are hidden in small corners. Most irritating is ""Jack's search index,"" which mixes clips of the film itself with other more fleshed out features in a giant alphabetical list. Not very useful, given the need to remember what you've selected before.In summary:This disc is a worthy upgrade. It houses a great video transfer, and at least as much extra material as the original 2 disc DVD, all on one Blu-Ray disc. At the price it's currently going for, it's a steal.Even if some of the extra features are missing from the DVD (which I have not taken the time to confirm due to the irritating menu system), there really is no reason to hang onto your old set. This one is superior in just about every conceivable way. No DVD could do what this Blu-Ray does. It is unquestionably superior and should be the disc anyone serious about this movie owns.",5,Stunningly good Blu-Ray for a 10 year-old film,1258416000,"11 17, 2009",2009,3685,"['movie', 'love', 'Fight', 'Club', 'one', 'best', 'American', 'films', 'past', '20', 'years', 'Literate', 'funny', 'disturbing', 'shocking', 'endlessly', 'entertaining', 'really', 'flaw', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'got', 'made', '2001', 'film', 'exploits', 'domestic', 'terrorist', 'who', 'destroy', 'buildings', 'could', 'probably', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'made.The', 'performances', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'started', 'believing', 'own', 'press', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'well', 'being', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'very', 'well', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'role', 'not', 'typecast', 'point', 'are', 'highlights.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'say', 'much', 'else', 'somehow', ""'ve"", 'avoided', 'seeing', 'movie', 'would', 'hate', 'spoil', 'must', 'see', 'plain', 'simple', 'up', 'there', 'films', 'Kubrick', 'Scorsese', 'other', 'American', 'cinematic', 'luminaries', 'past', '50', 'years.The', 'Blu-Ray', 'Wow', 'was', 'cringing', 'hoping', 'praying', 'Blu-Ray', 'gods', 'one', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'ruined', 'other', 'films', 'vintage', 'have', 'such', 'Gladiator', 'terrible', 'disrespectful', 'video', 'transfer', 'loaded', 'edge', 'enhancement', 'excessive', 'DNR', 'like.Well', 'prayers', 'were', 'answered', 'fine', 'lovely', 'film', 'grain', 'preserved', '2.40:1', '1080p', 'encode', 'Detail', 'very', 'strong', 'especially', 'cloth', 'textures', 'DARK', 'movie', 'blackness', 'well', 'represented', 'deep', 'rock', 'solid', 'blacks', 'Shadow', 'detail', 'great', 'though', 'loads', 'information', 'present', 'shadowy', 'near-black', 'parts', 'picture', 'BE', 'SURE', 'TO', 'CALIBRATE', 'TV', 'watching', 'must', 'have', 'brightness', 'contrast', 'gamma', 'set', 'properly', 'get', 'most', 'flick', 'color', 'palette', 'film', 'sickly', 'greens', 'browns', 'omnipresent', 'fluorescent', 'lighting', 'well-preserved.Fight', 'Club', 'was', 'early', 'DVD', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'day', 'Blu-Ray', 'DVD', 'out', 'rubs', 'face', 'dirt', 'corpse', 'quality', 'transfer', 'close', 'equal', 'best', 'current', 'films', 'today', 'really', 'stunning.Audio', 'presented', '5.1', 'channel', 'DTS-HD', 'soundtrack', 'perfectly', 'fine', 'Much', 'film', 'dialogue', 'heavy', 'when', 'surrounds', 'get', 'churning', 'sound', 'great', 'do', 'not', 'obscure', 'dialogue', 'really', 'main', 'thing', 'want', 'soundtrack', 'not', 'have', 'constantly', 'adjust', 'volume', 'watching', 'movie', 'Fight', 'Club', 'succeeds.Extras', 'include', '4', 'commentaries', 'everyone', 'director', 'stars', 'author', 'original', 'book', 'having', 'say', 'making', 'retrospective', 'features', 'are', 'mix', 'old', 'new', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'extras', 'previous', 'disc', 'are', 'present', 'least', 'are', 'new', 'stuff', 'HD', 'old', 'stuff', 'SD', 'must', 'say', 'organization', 'extras', 'not', 'great', 'menus', 'are', 'tad', 'confusing', 'lot', 'small', 'things', 'are', 'hidden', 'small', 'corners', 'Most', 'irritating', 'Jack', 'search', 'index', 'mixes', 'clips', 'film', 'other', 'more', 'fleshed', 'out', 'features', 'giant', 'alphabetical', 'list', 'Not', 'very', 'useful', 'given', 'need', 'remember', 'what', ""'ve"", 'selected', 'before.In', 'summary', 'disc', 'worthy', 'upgrade', 'houses', 'great', 'video', 'transfer', 'least', 'as', 'much', 'extra', 'material', 'original', '2', 'disc', 'DVD', 'one', 'Blu-Ray', 'disc', 'price', 'currently', 'going', 'steal.Even', 'extra', 'features', 'are', 'missing', 'DVD', 'have', 'not', 'taken', 'time', 'confirm', 'due', 'irritating', 'menu', 'system', 'really', 'reason', 'hang', 'old', 'set', 'one', 'superior', 'just', 'conceivable', 'way', 'DVD', 'could', 'do', 'what', 'Blu-Ray', 'unquestionably', 'superior', 'should', 'be', 'disc', 'anyone', 'serious', 'movie']",N/A

If the film was so much about antiestablishment, anti-consumerism, and anti-big business, then why did they advertise many name-brand merchandise in their film? For instance, IKEA had to approve of its name usage the film's script in order for them to use it. The film is so hypocritical. In addition, the film gets rather lengthy and dull after the first hour. I found myself turning off the film and doing other things. Fortunately, I returned to it and during the end it started to pick back up. On first watch, the film is very confusing, but once you watch it a second time or at least ponder it within your mind for an extended period of time you begin to piece things together in the very complicated plot.I read a lot of reviews that said &quot;this movie made you *think*,&quot; of course this movie will make you think: what movie DOESN'T? Even if a movie is horrible, it will make you think, &quot;Wow, this is a horrible movie&quot; (or something along those lines), right? So spare me with that argument.Also, I read a lot of reviews from people who completely agreed with all of the film's hegemonic beliefs and ideologies. The idea that we are all &quot;living in a time with no wars, we haven't had any major wars, therefore what is our purpose,&quot; and the tired, fashionable, Gen-X notion that we are all living meaningless, purposeless, lifeless consumer-driven, commercial, social-climbing lives. If you *really* believe this is so and stand completely behind these viewpoints, why don't you turn your COMPAQ computer off along with the SONY VCR or DVD PLAYER you used to watch the film, leave your 3 BEDROOM HOME, abandon your HONDA, and go to the woods, so that you can live off the land, smell musty, eat grapes, and get mauled by a bear.Stop griping and complaining about the world being a &quot;horrible, meaningless place&quot; and do something about it. Make your life worthwhile: go volunteer, help out in the communities of those in need (like the inner city or even your own community), try to make a difference instead of sipping your STARBUCKS FRAPPACINO and watching films by overpaid actors and writers, while you sit on your duff complaining about how screwed up YOUR WORLD is.",2,Thought-provoking or Hypocritical?,983923200,"03 7, 2001",2001,2616,"['Fight', 'Club', 'very', 'atmospheric', 'highly-stylized', 'complicated', 'movie', 'deals', 'issue', 'existentialism', 'eyes', 'nameless', 'character', 'deemed', 'quot', 'Narrator', 'quot', 'Ed', 'Norton', '.I', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'all-over-the-place', 'thematically', 'trying', 'hard', 'juggle', 'Camus', 'quot', 'Stranger', 'quot', 'quot', 'Last', 'Action', 'Hero', 'quot', 'complicated', 'ultimately', 'contradictory', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'antiestablishment', 'anti-consumerism', 'anti-big', 'business', 'then', 'why', 'did', 'advertise', 'many', 'name-brand', 'merchandise', 'film', 'instance', 'IKEA', 'had', 'approve', 'name', 'film', 'script', 'order', 'use', 'film', 'so', 'hypocritical', 'addition', 'film', 'rather', 'lengthy', 'dull', 'first', 'hour', 'found', 'turning', 'off', 'film', 'doing', 'other', 'things', 'Fortunately', 'returned', 'end', 'started', 'pick', 'back', 'up', 'first', 'watch', 'film', 'very', 'confusing', 'once', 'watch', 'second', 'time', 'least', 'ponder', 'mind', 'extended', 'period', 'time', 'begin', 'piece', 'things', 'together', 'very', 'complicated', 'plot.I', 'read', 'lot', 'reviews', 'said', 'quot', 'movie', 'made', '*think*', 'quot', 'course', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'think', 'what', 'movie', 'DOES', ""N'T"", 'Even', 'movie', 'horrible', 'will', 'make', 'think', 'quot', 'Wow', 'horrible', 'movie', 'quot', 'something', 'lines', 'right', 'So', 'spare', 'argument.Also', 'read', 'lot', 'reviews', 'people', 'who', 'completely', 'agreed', 'film', 'hegemonic', 'beliefs', 'ideologies', 'idea', 'are', 'quot', 'living', 'time', 'wars', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'major', 'wars', 'therefore', 'what', 'purpose', 'quot', 'tired', 'fashionable', 'Gen-X', 'notion', 'are', 'living', 'meaningless', 'purposeless', 'lifeless', 'consumer-driven', 'commercial', 'social-climbing', 'lives', '*really*', 'believe', 'so', 'stand', 'completely', 'viewpoints', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'turn', 'COMPAQ', 'computer', 'SONY', 'VCR', 'DVD', 'PLAYER', 'used', 'watch', 'film', 'leave', '3', 'BEDROOM', 'HOME', 'abandon', 'HONDA', 'go', 'woods', 'can', 'live', 'off', 'land', 'smell', 'musty', 'eat', 'grapes', 'get', 'mauled', 'bear.Stop', 'griping', 'complaining', 'world', 'being', 'quot', 'horrible', 'meaningless', 'place', 'quot', 'do', 'something', 'Make', 'life', 'worthwhile', 'go', 'volunteer', 'help', 'out', 'communities', 'need', 'inner', 'city', 'even', 'own', 'community', 'try', 'make', 'difference', 'instead', 'sipping', 'STARBUCKS', 'FRAPPACINO', 'watching', 'films', 'overpaid', 'actors', 'writers', 'sit', 'duff', 'complaining', 'how', 'screwed', 'up', 'YOUR', 'WORLD']",N/A

For years my favorite movie was Terry Gilliam's Brazil, but Fight Club has managed to remove it from the mantle and take it's place as what I consider to be the finest film ever made.Not to quote the infamous line from the movie, but you truly cannot tell a person about Fight Club.  It's like The Matrix, it's a film better seen the first time knowing nothing about.  Even better if you go into it with misperceived notions of what the movie's about, so you can be proved wrong.I think the only problem with the movie is that it was meant to be seen on the Big screen.  It uses certain camera tricks and techniques that were meant to enhance the theatrical experience.  I fear that anyone seeing this movie for the first time at home will not take from it everything that the theatrical experience provided.So...for a proper viewing of this film...PLEASE follow the following rules:  1) be relaxed.  be ready and in the right state of mind to sit back and watch a long film.  It's NOT like watching &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot;, but it is an involved film that will require your patients and attention 2) remove all distraction.  Go to the bathroom, unplug the phone, and be settled to watch a great movie 3) turn off the lights, you'll like the movie a lot better in darkness...it's a very dark film and you'll need darkness to see everything 4) if you didn't like it...wait two weeks and watch it again.For a movie review:  It is difficult to talk about the film without ruining it.  I first saw the preview for it when I went to see The Phantom Menace.  It was part of a Fox set of previews.  I saw a bunch of guys fighting and a bar of soap.  I thought, &quot;Is this like that lame Van Damme movie Lionheart?  No thanks.&quot;  In fact none of the previews made me want to see it.  Months later, after it's release, I heard a radio add for the film.  The add sparked a little interest in me because it involved the reading three scathing reviews by critics and one positive review.  I thought it was very ballsy of them to release those adds, but I still didn't go see the movie.The next week I was away in upstate New York on a job interview.  I was flown there from California and had nothing to do on Thursday night in the tiny town that I was staying in.  They had an impressive movie theater, so I thought I'd unwind from my 10 hour interview by taking a film in.  When I arrived at the theater, Fight Club was just starting, so I bought a ticket on a whim (even though I really didn't like Lionheart very much).  I walked out of that film with my mind buzzing.  I had just enjoyed one of the most incredible theatrical experiences I had been through in a very long time.  As soon as I go back to San Diego I took three friends to see the movie.  I was so excited for them to see it and to hear their reaction.  I Needed someone to talk about the film with.  After the movie, and for the entire ride home in the car, no one said a word.  I thought to myself &quot;Oh no!  They hate me for making them see this movie.&quot;  Finally all three broke the silence and thanked me for taking them to one of the best movies they've ever seen.  I saw that movie 4 times in the theater, because I wanted all of my friends to see it.  Some loved it, some hated it, some didn't get it...but all were happy they saw it.I don't want to give away any of the movie.  I'll just warn you that you'll like it or you'll hate it.  Either way, you should see it.  If you have no opinion about it...you need to learn to think a bit more critically about your world and the art that you see, because this is a film that you should have an opinion about.As for the DVD, like the Seven DVD, David Fincher packs it full of goodies and commentaries that make it a worthwhile purchase.Finally, you can make a great Trilogy if you watch three movies in this order.  First watch American Beauty, then Fight Club, and finally Office Space.  All three films have similar messages told in very different ways.  Watch Office Space last, because the first two films are so heavy, you might need a little comedy to lighten your mood.  Warning: watching these three films may make you quit your tedious job/life and go look for something more fulfilling in the world.",5,My Favorite Film,987465600,"04 17, 2001",2001,4276,"['Fight', 'Club', 'favorite', 'movie', 'years', 'favorite', 'movie', 'was', 'Terry', 'Gilliam', 'Brazil', 'Fight', 'Club', 'managed', 'remove', 'mantle', 'take', 'place', 'what', 'consider', 'be', 'finest', 'film', 'ever', 'quote', 'infamous', 'line', 'movie', 'truly', 'can', 'not', 'tell', 'person', 'Fight', 'Club', 'Matrix', 'film', 'better', 'seen', 'first', 'time', 'knowing', 'nothing', 'Even', 'better', 'go', 'misperceived', 'notions', 'what', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'proved', 'wrong.I', 'think', 'only', 'problem', 'movie', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'seen', 'Big', 'screen', 'certain', 'camera', 'tricks', 'techniques', 'were', 'meant', 'enhance', 'theatrical', 'experience', 'fear', 'anyone', 'seeing', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'home', 'will', 'not', 'take', 'everything', 'theatrical', 'experience', 'provided.So', 'proper', 'viewing', 'film', 'PLEASE', 'follow', 'following', 'rules', '1', 'be', 'relaxed', 'be', 'ready', 'right', 'state', 'mind', 'sit', 'back', 'watch', 'long', 'film', 'NOT', 'watching', 'quot', 'Thin', 'Red', 'Line', 'quot', 'involved', 'film', 'will', 'require', 'patients', 'attention', '2', 'remove', 'distraction', 'Go', 'bathroom', 'unplug', 'phone', 'be', 'settled', 'watch', 'great', 'movie', '3', 'turn', 'off', 'lights', ""'ll"", 'like', 'movie', 'lot', 'better', 'darkness', 'very', 'dark', 'film', ""'ll"", 'need', 'darkness', 'see', 'everything', '4', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'wait', 'two', 'weeks', 'watch', 'again.For', 'movie', 'review', 'difficult', 'talk', 'film', 'ruining', 'first', 'saw', 'preview', 'when', 'went', 'see', 'Phantom', 'Menace', 'was', 'part', 'Fox', 'set', 'previews', 'saw', 'bunch', 'guys', 'fighting', 'bar', 'soap', 'thought', 'quot', 'lame', 'Van', 'Damme', 'movie', 'Lionheart', 'No', 'thanks.', 'quot', 'fact', 'none', 'previews', 'made', 'want', 'see', 'Months', 'later', 'release', 'heard', 'radio', 'add', 'film', 'add', 'sparked', 'little', 'interest', 'involved', 'reading', 'three', 'scathing', 'reviews', 'critics', 'one', 'positive', 'review', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'ballsy', 'release', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'see', 'movie.The', 'week', 'was', 'away', 'upstate', 'New', 'York', 'job', 'interview', 'was', 'flown', 'there', 'California', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'Thursday', 'night', 'tiny', 'town', 'was', 'staying', 'had', 'impressive', 'movie', 'theater', 'thought', ""'d"", 'unwind', '10', 'hour', 'interview', 'taking', 'film', 'When', 'arrived', 'theater', 'Fight', 'Club', 'was', 'just', 'starting', 'bought', 'ticket', 'whim', 'even', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'Lionheart', 'very', 'much', 'walked', 'film', 'mind', 'buzzing', 'had', 'just', 'enjoyed', 'one', 'most', 'incredible', 'theatrical', 'experiences', 'had', 'been', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'As', 'soon', 'go', 'back', 'San', 'Diego', 'took', 'three', 'friends', 'see', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'excited', 'see', 'hear', 'reaction', 'Needed', 'someone', 'talk', 'film', 'movie', 'entire', 'ride', 'home', 'car', 'one', 'said', 'word', 'thought', 'myself', 'quot', 'Oh', 'hate', 'making', 'see', 'movie.', 'quot', 'Finally', 'three', 'broke', 'silence', 'thanked', 'taking', 'one', 'best', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'saw', 'movie', '4', 'times', 'theater', 'wanted', 'friends', 'see', 'loved', 'hated', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'were', 'happy', 'saw', 'it.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'just', 'warn', ""'ll"", 'like', ""'ll"", 'hate', 'way', 'should', 'see', 'have', 'opinion', 'need', 'learn', 'think', 'bit', 'more', 'critically', 'world', 'art', 'see', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'opinion', 'about.As', 'DVD', 'Seven', 'DVD', 'David', 'Fincher', 'full', 'goodies', 'commentaries', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'purchase.Finally', 'can', 'make', 'great', 'Trilogy', 'watch', 'three', 'movies', 'order', 'First', 'watch', 'American', 'Beauty', 'then', 'Fight', 'Club', 'finally', 'Office', 'Space', 'three', 'films', 'have', 'similar', 'messages', 'told', 'very', 'different', 'ways', 'Watch', 'Office', 'Space', 'last', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'are', 'so', 'heavy', 'might', 'need', 'little', 'comedy', 'lighten', 'mood', 'Warning', 'watching', 'three', 'films', 'may', 'make', 'quit', 'tedious', 'job/life', 'go', 'look', 'something', 'more', 'fulfilling', 'world']",N/A

There is a gun pointed straight into our mouths and for a second, we see nothing but...wait, let me start eairlier...This is the story of a no-name individual (let's call him Jack) who feels, well, stuck. He lives in a very respectable apartment with some very respectable clothes and furniture with a very &quot;respectable&quot; job. Jack has spent the last six months of his life with insomnia. He can't sleep, nor can he keep a clear idea of what's going on around him. As he says, &quot;everything is a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy...&quot; I am Jack's life, and I'm ending one minute at a time.I am Jack's solution:Along come the support groups...Cancer, tumors, trauma, Jack has none of these things, but for some reason, feeling the pain of others who do helps him sleep. Jack starts attending as many of these sessions as possible in an attempt to feel the world around him. He lets go, and cries with the victims of these groups. And, as he so eloquently puts it, &quot;Babies don't sleep this well...&quot; It seems that Jack is cured until Marla Singer comes along. Marla is a tourist to these groups just like Jack, and she reflects his lie. &quot;I couldn't cry...so once again, I couldn't sleep.&quot;I am Jack's call for help:We wake up on an airplane on the way home from a business trip. We stare at our single-serving peanuts and our single serving cup of coffee. Next to us, a man spouts his incredibly cynical, yet subtly brilliant views on the world. Meet Tyler Durdin...I am Jack's need for friendship...Tyler and Jack have an interesting conversation for the rest of the flight, and Jack leaves and arrives home to find his apartment in flames...I am Jack's complete and utter numbness...Jack decides to call up Tyler for a place to stay for reasons that are unclear to both us and Jack.I am Jack's new life:We meet up with Tyler in Lou's Tavern discussing the next step for Jack. What happens now?...I am Jack's inflamed sense of confusion...Outside the bar, Tyler discusses things that Jack can do to help himself, including offering Jack shelter at his home. Jack accepts and off we go...&quot;I want you to hit me as hard as you can.&quot;I am Jack's thoughts:Fight Club is one of those rare films that was recommended to me by some friends of mine, who told me how cool and mind-blowing it was. The thing that makes it different from all of those other movies is that I actually ended up loving this film for everything it is and everything it tries to be (most of my friends' tastes compared to mine are drastically different).

Rice ""'Mike Rice, Cultural Historian""","[5, 8]","When Susan Faluhdi wrote a piece saluting this film, but really promoting her own book Stiffed, I decided I'd better have a look. We're nearing the end of the Century and the Millenium and the jig is up in nearly every direction. The Cold War is over. The major political fights in America are over lifestyle issues. The folks producing films are forced to use vaguely focused Arab terrorists as villians, because the traditional communists are our friends, sort of. And Feminists are writing books in defense of abused MEN.Its the perfect backdrop for a story about young guys so fed up with the ennui of these times, their only relief comes from knocking one another senseless. First its the two friends, Brad Pitt and Ed Norton who knock one another about while living in a broken down abandoned building. But in the words of an old Chrysler commercial, it starts a movement, a momentum a beat. And the Beat Goes On with fight clubs forming all over America.You would think Pitt would be the lead here, but its Ed Norton handling the narrative, the voice-over. Ed goes through the usual contortions. Bored in the meaningless job he holds in the corporate world, Norton quits and takes up an equally meaningless unemployed existence with Pitt. Why work for the soulless corporate machine when you can appear just as prosperous with no job at all.Lingering in the background is a decidedly un-English-looking Helen Bonham Carter. Helen hasn't a lot to do but smoke cigs and look downmarket and fetching. The storytellers are holding her out here in hopes that either Norton or Pitt will make a move on her. For Pitt, that is out of the question. Norton walks her home a couple of times. But Helen doesn'treally get a lot of action in this movie. So much for the love interest.The movie is a guy thing you see. I can barely remember what the climactic scene at the end is about. Its just a lot of cosmic acting out; Jimmy Carter's Malaise. Its supposed to mean something, but it doesn't have to really, since its producing the requisite violence for a $75 million domestic gross.

The second time I saw this movie, I did pretty much the same thing.  It has an enormous effect on me.There's something very unsettling about &quot;Fight Club&quot;.  It's not the graphic violence; I can handle that.  It's not the idea that to be a twenty-first century twenty-something male is to be disenchanted and disassociated; frankly, that's just giving in to your inner crybaby.  No, the thing that's unsettling about &quot;Fight Club&quot; is that the whole system we've set up to pamper our enormous egos is a sham.  A wasteful, illogical, unspiritual sham.  The goal of this movie, then, is to be our collective soap.David Fincher is a great visual stylist, infatuated with his director's palette.  He uses every trick in the book here, and consistently stops just short of going over the line of good taste.  And to me, that's what makes this movie so special.  He pushes the limits, but it never feels like he is pushing too hard.  And for a two-hour plus movie chock full of special effects and visual magic, that's an astounding feat.Edward Norton is spot-on.  He is dry, constantly on edge, and very much awake.  I felt exhausted just looking at him.  The scene where he fights himself in his boss' office is both funny and frightening.  And Brad Pitt is just perfect here.  It frustrates me when people bemoan his casting in this part -- I wonder if they were watching the same movie.  The character needed to be charismatic, rebellious, intense, funny, very physical and especially very beautiful.  Who else could they have cast?  These two actors work extremely well together.  Of course if they didn't, the whole house of cards would cave in on itself.  And it never does.  Throw in Helena Bonham Carter -- witty, spacey, and crackling with life while doing a dance of death -- and you get an excellent triumvirate of lead actors.Two minor quibbles:...the exploding refrigerator scene was unnecessary, one of the few times when Fincher goes too far in his visual styling....Meatloaf, while definitely looking the part, just didn't have the acting chops to pull off his critical role.So it's not perfect, but it comes pretty damn close.Sometimes I feel like I can go on forever about this movie.  There are just so many good things to talk about.  But I'll stop now in the hopes that the masses who stayed away while it was in theatres discover it now.",5,I am Mike's glowing review of Fight Club,969926400,"09 26, 2000",2000,2520,"['first', 'time', 'saw', 'movie', 'roamed', 'streets', 'afterward', 'crazed', 'look', 'face', 'observing', 'everyone', 'saw', 'corner', 'eye', 'second', 'time', 'saw', 'movie', 'did', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'thing', 'enormous', 'effect', 'me.There', 'something', 'very', 'unsettling', 'quot', 'Fight', 'Club', 'quot', 'not', 'graphic', 'violence', 'can', 'handle', 'not', 'idea', 'be', 'twenty-first', 'century', 'twenty-something', 'male', 'be', 'disenchanted', 'disassociated', 'frankly', 'just', 'giving', 'inner', 'crybaby', 'No', 'thing', 'unsettling', 'quot', 'Fight', 'Club', 'quot', 'whole', 'system', ""'ve"", 'set', 'up', 'pamper', 'enormous', 'egos', 'sham', 'wasteful', 'illogical', 'unspiritual', 'sham', 'goal', 'movie', 'then', 'be', 'collective', 'soap.David', 'Fincher', 'great', 'visual', 'stylist', 'infatuated', 'director', 'palette', 'trick', 'book', 'here', 'consistently', 'just', 'short', 'going', 'line', 'good', 'taste', 'what', 'movie', 'so', 'special', 'limits', 'never', 'pushing', 'too', 'hard', 'two-hour', 'plus', 'movie', 'chock', 'full', 'special', 'effects', 'visual', 'magic', 'astounding', 'feat.Edward', 'Norton', 'spot-on', 'dry', 'constantly', 'edge', 'very', 'much', 'awake', 'felt', 'exhausted', 'just', 'looking', 'scene', 'where', 'boss', 'office', 'funny', 'frightening', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'just', 'perfect', 'here', 'when', 'people', 'bemoan', 'casting', 'part', 'wonder', 'were', 'watching', 'same', 'movie', 'character', 'needed', 'be', 'charismatic', 'rebellious', 'intense', 'funny', 'very', 'physical', 'especially', 'very', 'beautiful', 'Who', 'else', 'could', 'have', 'cast', 'two', 'actors', 'work', 'extremely', 'well', 'together', 'course', 'did', ""n't"", 'whole', 'house', 'cards', 'would', 'cave', 'never', 'Throw', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'witty', 'spacey', 'crackling', 'life', 'doing', 'dance', 'death', 'get', 'excellent', 'triumvirate', 'lead', 'actors.Two', 'minor', 'quibbles', 'exploding', 'refrigerator', 'scene', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'one', 'few', 'times', 'when', 'Fincher', 'too', 'far', 'visual', 'styling', '.Meatloaf', 'definitely', 'looking', 'part', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'acting', 'chops', 'pull', 'off', 'critical', 'role.So', 'not', 'perfect', 'pretty', 'damn', 'close.Sometimes', 'feel', 'can', 'go', 'forever', 'movie', 'are', 'just', 'so', 'many', 'good', 'things', 'talk', ""'ll"", 'stop', 'now', 'hopes', 'masses', 'who', 'stayed', 'away', 'was', 'theatres', 'now']",N/A

Ah, and stars Edward Norton and Brad Pitt.Truth is, that's only part of the package.Fight Club is a dark and nihilistic saga about the life of average men, at the brink of a new century. A right -or left- hook through the solar plexus of movie goers. A wake-up call to reality.Norton serves as an anonymous narrator; he's an average Joe, with a mindless job, drown in boredom, hungry for status and motivation; until he meets Tyler Durhem, a rebel soul that lives to impress others.Everything in Tyler is unusual: his wardrobe, his shameful way of saying things, his eagerness to look for fights. It doesn't take much time to lure the narrator to one of his fights and found The Fight Club, where the prerequisite to belong is to not speak of fight club.The intern fights are not enough, the pranks emerge. One step at a time, the club prepares to a bigger goal: massive destruction. And Tyler's and the narrator's relationship get fishy.Norton and Pitt throw themselves into their characters with such craft it's impossible to recognize them. Pitt is very convincing as the relentless Tyler; Norton finds a way to exude his wrath and confusion although his character is very cold.While Norton and Pitt try to see who will first break each other's nose, Fight Club lets out to the surface a splendid critic about greed, the waste of our consumit society, our egotistic aptitudes and the violent nature of men whose only contact comes when they are beating each other.No, Fight Club is not another movie of men throwing punches without reason, consumed by violence and self-pity.Good for that!",5,A real K.O.,1118966400,"06 17, 2005",2005,1760,"['seen', 'trailer', 'Fight', 'Club', 'will', 'think', 'what', 'bunch', 'bored', 'masochistic', 'men', 'almost', 'kill', 'other', 'prove', ""'re"", 'alive', 'Ah', 'stars', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'Brad', 'Pitt.Truth', 'only', 'part', 'package.Fight', 'Club', 'dark', 'nihilistic', 'saga', 'life', 'average', 'men', 'brink', 'new', 'century', 'right', '-or', 'left-', 'hook', 'solar', 'plexus', 'movie', 'goers', 'wake-up', 'call', 'reality.Norton', 'serves', 'anonymous', 'narrator', 'average', 'Joe', 'mindless', 'job', 'drown', 'boredom', 'hungry', 'status', 'motivation', 'Tyler', 'Durhem', 'rebel', 'soul', 'impress', 'others.Everything', 'Tyler', 'unusual', 'wardrobe', 'shameful', 'way', 'saying', 'things', 'eagerness', 'look', 'fights', ""n't"", 'take', 'much', 'time', 'lure', 'narrator', 'one', 'fights', 'found', 'Fight', 'Club', 'where', 'prerequisite', 'belong', 'not', 'speak', 'fight', 'club.The', 'intern', 'fights', 'are', 'not', 'enough', 'pranks', 'emerge', 'One', 'step', 'time', 'club', 'bigger', 'goal', 'massive', 'destruction', 'Tyler', 'narrator', 'relationship', 'get', 'fishy.Norton', 'Pitt', 'throw', 'characters', 'such', 'craft', 'impossible', 'recognize', 'Pitt', 'very', 'convincing', 'relentless', 'Tyler', 'Norton', 'way', 'exude', 'wrath', 'confusion', 'character', 'very', 'cold.While', 'Norton', 'Pitt', 'try', 'see', 'who', 'will', 'first', 'break', 'other', 'nose', 'Fight', 'Club', 'out', 'surface', 'splendid', 'critic', 'greed', 'waste', 'consumit', 'society', 'egotistic', 'aptitudes', 'violent', 'nature', 'men', 'only', 'contact', 'when', 'are', 'beating', 'other.No', 'Fight', 'Club', 'not', 'movie', 'men', 'throwing', 'punches', 'reason', 'consumed', 'violence', 'self-pity.Good']",N/A

In an effort to break free, he soon becomes a frequent visitor to self help groups. He begins to discover that hearing other people's problems make his pale in comparison which finally produces a cure for his insomnia. He also meets a slippery soap salesman named Tyler Durden ( Brad Pitt). The two soon become friends and develop the concept of underground fight clubs. All different types of men are allowed to take out their frustrations on the world by fighting each other. Tyler soon becomes obsessed with using the fight clubs as an outlet to rewrite the rules of society by assigning memebers of the clubs tasks to be completed before each session that consist of committing random acts of vandalism and violence. Things soon start to spin out of control however, when the phenomenon of the fight club spreads to other cities all acorss America and more and more men are willing to do whatever it takes to have their next fight.Fight Club is one of the best films ever made in my opinion, and if I had make a list consisting of my five favorite films, Fight Club would definately be on it. The film provides an interesting premise taken from the novel of the same name written by Chuck Palanhiuk, as well as constant laughs, hard hitting action, and incredible performances from Edward Norton and Brad Pitt. Both Norton and Pitt have great on screen chemistry together and appear as if they could be friends in real life. The fight scenes in this movie are extremely well choreographed and come off looking very realistic. They offer a savage and raw style of fighting that makes most fight scenes you will see pale in comparison. Perhaps my favorite aspect of Fight Club, is the story behind the film taken from Chuck Palanhiuk's novel. The issues of the story take an honest and humorous look at consumerism and the way that society is obsessed with defining themselves based on what they own. The film stresses that after awhile the things you own, end up owning you, and this is what leads Tyler on his mission to show that you are only free to do anything, once you have lost everything.Overall, the acting, interesting and humorous premise, and fantastic fight scenes all come together to create a fantastic film.

Okay, so there's fighting but there's definitely a lot more to it.  The movie begins with narrator Edward Norton as an insomniac who solves his problem by crying it out at support meetings surrounded by dying people.  That is until Marla (Helena Bonham Carter) turns up.  Also a tourist she ruins his sessions, until he goes to live with Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) after his flat is burnt down.  Both men manage to fight out their pent-up aggression and Norton almost manages to forget about the enigmatic Marla.  Gradually this 'fight club' grows into an expression against a comsumerist society with rules and orders.The movie poses several important questions about the nature of society and the nature of the self, comparing the rules and order of society with the rules and order of the self.  Certainly on this level it should be applauded as being in a recent rush of intelligent Hollywood movies, and this is definitely one of the best of the lot.  With regards to acting it's a real gem, with Norton proving once more that he is capable of just about anything a director can throw at him.  As Tyler, Pitt adds to all those annoyingly unnoticed superb performances that he's notched up and Helena Bonham Carter plays against type marvellously.It's also beautifully shot, demonstrating the characters' lust for violence well.  The violent scenes are not for the faint-hearted but there's also nothing gratuitous here.  Plus, there's an ending that makes you reevaluate everything that's gone on before.

This coupled with an overwhelming desire to see it again, and you have a serious state  of confusion. That confusion, left proffesional critics with no option but  to dismiss it as a showoffy stylistic exercise with no purpose. As a  regular viewer, I find this to be a truly unique film. Most say that its a  satire about gen X dis-satisfaction and rise of cults.Other, myself  included, call it a comedy. The truth is FIGHT CLUB IS ANYTHING YOU WANT IT  TO BE. If you have and IQ in the low 60s you may want to go out and get in  to a fight, and it is to you that most movie critics felt a responsibility  when panning the film, to the rest of you see this film, and then see it  again. It is so rich that you can't possibly catch all of it in one  viewing, so many ideas tossed around that you can debate, if that is your  thing. The one quib I have with Fight Club, and I'm sure you've heard this  before, is the twist half an hour towards the end.Without giving away  anything I will say that it ruins the volatile dynamic the film had going  between the lead characters. I would have loved to see where their  relationship would have ended up without the intervention of the script. On  the other hand this u-turn provides it with yet another sub-text,madness.

All of the publicity was about how violent the movie was and there was not much mention of anything else. I was a bit of a David Fincher fan after The Game and Seven and I really like Edward Norton, who in my opinion is the finest actor of his generation, but I still thought who really wants to see a movie about people knocking lumps out of each other for 133 minutes? I certainly didn't and so weeks went by until one of my favourite UK movie magazines published their top twenty movies of 1999. What was top? You guessed it, Fight Club. But I still wasn't convinced. However, I'd seen everything else that I'd wanted to see and Fight Club was about to leave the theatres and on the basis that every review of the movie in the UK had been five star I felt I had to see it. I didn't expect to enjoy it but I kind of felt that as a supposed film buff it was my duty to watch even if I was going to hate it. I couldn't have been more wrong, I was blown away by this movie. It was nothing like I expected and nothing like the hype. And it's not just a guy movie either, I watched this with my wife and she loved this movie as much as I did and at the end she turned to me and said one word ""wow""! Sure there is some very realistic and gorey fight scenes in this movie but to characterise it as a mindless bloodfest is to do it an enormous disservice. This is an incredibly powerful movie that pulls one surprise after another. It has an incredibly original script, excellent direction and wonderful acting. Not only is the ever fantastic Edward Norton better than he's ever been before (or perhaps ever will be) but he is ably supported by Brad Pitt (who I'm generally not a great fan of) as the charasmatic anarchist and soap salesmen Tyler Durden, the superb Helenah Bonham Carter totally cast against type as Marla (...)(in what should have been a multi-award winning performance) and Meat Loaf. Yeah, Meat Loaf in good film, understated, funny, good acting shock!!! Who would have believed it? Not me but then Fight Club is that kind of movie, it is nothing like you'd imagine.I don't want to give the plot of the movie away in case you haven't already seen it. To my mind the best way to watch a movie (and in particular this movie) is with no prior expectations and an open mind. This movie is a rollercoaster ride that will take you places and directions that no movie has taken you before. How good is it? Well, I read a magazine interview and Edward Norton stated that when he and Brad Pitt watched the movie for the first time, Brad Pitt turned to him and said ""you know this is the best movie we will ever be in"" and Edward Norton agreed. That's how good it is! Darkly comic, a visual and verbal assault on the senses, Fight Club is perhaps a movie before its time that has divided (and will continue to divide) audience opinions to the widest of extremes. Does it have a deep and meaningful message? Maybe it does and maybe it doesn't and maybe that's exactly the point, maybe that's how our world is at this particular place and time. Whatever, in my opinion Fight Club beats the hell out of most other movies and fully deserves five stars.",5,USE SOAP!!!,1006905600,"11 28, 2001",2001,3215,"['When', 'movie', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'had', 'real', 'desire', 'see', 'publicity', 'was', 'how', 'violent', 'movie', 'was', 'was', 'not', 'much', 'mention', 'anything', 'else', 'was', 'bit', 'David', 'Fincher', 'fan', 'Game', 'Seven', 'really', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'who', 'opinion', 'finest', 'actor', 'generation', 'still', 'thought', 'who', 'really', 'see', 'movie', 'people', 'knocking', 'lumps', 'other', '133', 'minutes', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'so', 'weeks', 'went', 'one', 'favourite', 'UK', 'movie', 'magazines', 'published', 'top', 'twenty', 'movies', '1999', 'What', 'was', 'top', 'guessed', 'Fight', 'Club', 'still', 'was', ""n't"", 'convinced', 'However', ""'d"", 'seen', 'everything', 'else', ""'d"", 'wanted', 'see', 'Fight', 'Club', 'was', 'leave', 'theatres', 'basis', 'review', 'movie', 'UK', 'had', 'been', 'five', 'star', 'felt', 'had', 'see', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'enjoy', 'kind', 'felt', 'supposed', 'film', 'buff', 'was', 'duty', 'watch', 'even', 'was', 'going', 'hate', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'more', 'wrong', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'movie', 'was', 'nothing', 'expected', 'nothing', 'hype', 'not', 'just', 'guy', 'movie', 'watched', 'wife', 'loved', 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'end', 'turned', 'said', 'one', 'word', 'wow', 'Sure', 'very', 'realistic', 'gorey', 'fight', 'scenes', 'movie', 'characterise', 'mindless', 'bloodfest', 'do', 'enormous', 'disservice', 'incredibly', 'powerful', 'movie', 'one', 'surprise', 'incredibly', 'original', 'script', 'excellent', 'direction', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'Not', 'only', 'ever', 'fantastic', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'better', 'ever', 'been', 'before', 'perhaps', 'ever', 'will', 'be', 'ably', 'supported', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'who', ""'m"", 'generally', 'not', 'great', 'fan', 'charasmatic', 'anarchist', 'soap', 'salesmen', 'Tyler', 'Durden', 'superb', 'Helenah', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'totally', 'cast', 'type', 'Marla', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'multi-award', 'winning', 'performance', 'Meat', 'Loaf', 'Yeah', 'Meat', 'Loaf', 'good', 'film', 'understated', 'funny', 'good', 'acting', 'shock', 'Who', 'would', 'have', 'believed', 'Not', 'then', 'Fight', 'Club', 'kind', 'movie', 'nothing', ""'d"", 'imagine.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'plot', 'movie', 'away', 'case', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'seen', 'mind', 'best', 'way', 'watch', 'movie', 'particular', 'movie', 'prior', 'expectations', 'open', 'mind', 'movie', 'rollercoaster', 'ride', 'will', 'take', 'places', 'directions', 'movie', 'taken', 'How', 'good', 'Well', 'read', 'magazine', 'interview', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'stated', 'when', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'watched', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'turned', 'said', 'know', 'best', 'movie', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'agreed', 'how', 'good', 'Darkly', 'comic', 'visual', 'verbal', 'assault', 'senses', 'Fight', 'Club', 'perhaps', 'movie', 'time', 'divided', 'will', 'continue', 'divide', 'audience', 'opinions', 'widest', 'extremes', 'have', 'deep', 'meaningful', 'message', 'Maybe', 'maybe', ""n't"", 'maybe', 'exactly', 'point', 'maybe', 'how', 'world', 'particular', 'place', 'time', 'opinion', 'Fight', 'Club', 'hell', 'most', 'other', 'movies', 'fully', 'five', 'stars']",N/A

The comedy is of the blackest variety and you will have to suspend any squeamish-ness you may feel toward very violent films to reap enjoyment out of it.  But all the roles are skillfully played, especially by Brad Pitt's Tyler Durden, and underlying the banality of blood and mayhem is a message...a message that perhaps life doesn't have to control us...life can be what you make it...just be carefully you do so thoughtful with positive human regard and a degree of clarity.  Attempting to control life can get out of hand.Chuck Palahnuik's novel comes to life in the adept hands of director David Fincher (of Seven fame).  It is no surprise that the scenes are slickly cool, the violence is of the &quot;in your face&quot; variety, and we are entertained despite our misgivings. The movie has some real &quot;Momento&quot; moments, so I won't try to delve into the story-line to risk giving any of those away.  A truly fetching role is turned in by Helena Bonham Carter as Marla Singer a chain smoking barely hanging on to life love interest of Edward Norton's.  Their chemistry and interplay is terrifically authentic and dead-on funny.  Brad Pitt take the show though as Tyler Durden, an ultra-confident hipster that makes soap.  The lines he and Norton toss back and forth are classics to be remembered and quoted in bars, around water coolers, at support groups.&quot;Fight Club&quot; is an experience you owe yourself, if not for anything more than to ponder the state of society and what is truly important.  I think if you see the movie out to the end and get past the violence, you may find this message though-provoking.

What wasn't expected however, is how Fight Club has become a modern day cult classic that no one ever saw coming.  I won't waste time with the storyline, you can read about it in the Amazon review, but what I will say is that director David Fincher has come quite a long way since his directorial debut helming the dreadful Alien 3, the way he seamlessly infuses CGI with the film is amazing.  Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, and Helena Bonham Carter give knockout performances.  Norton's narration throughout the entire movie is unexpectedly hilarious at some parts and chilling at others.  While yes, the film is quite brutal, but it is nowhere as violent as perceived to be, and I love the package design (the fact that negative reviews of the film are featured in the booklet is genius), and the commentaries and deleted scenes are worth owning the movie alone.

This is one of the few movies that is on par or better that the book version. Others in this catagory include: The Godfather, Shawshank Redemption, and the Green Mile.One of my favorite things about this DVD is the booklet that comes with it which contains reviews of the movie.

Tyler has many jobs in this movie, and among them a film projector runner. Fight Club shows his guerilla influence thoughout. Such as his image appearing for a few frames in the scene and vanishing.Normally I hate Brad Pitt, but his performance as Tyler is perfect. Ed Norton really shows off his acting skills as well, in an tragically ingored film. Well, folks, now is your chance to endorse the dying genre of the Great Film.

519011,A22PV91A5CNOGO,B00003CWQ2,"NY film buff ""A reader from NY, NY""","[4, 4]","About half way through David Fincher's ""Fight Club,"" I found myself remembering one of Barney Fife's lines from ""The Andy Griffith Show."" 'Here at The Rock we have two rules. Rule Number One: Obey all the rules.' It is highly unlikely that the director had any desire to remind viewers of this ancient comedic moment, but there's no denying that odd flashes of humor crop up here and there throughout the film. ""Fight Club"" has been described by detractors as overly slick and heavily macho, but its fans find it clever and visually stunning, with moments of real brilliance. I think the fans have got it right: there are some moments of brilliance, and if you can deal with the explicit violence the movie is beautiful to watch.The unnamed protagonist (excellent work by Edward Norton) is a sad sack white collar worker suffering from insomnia and drifting aimlessly through the more or less soulless environment of contemporary urban America. In an effort to feel connected to something--anything--he becomes a support-group addict, religiously attending self-help meetings for alcoholics, cancer patients, etc., etc. When his apartment, with all of his carefully collected worldly goods, literally explodes, he finds refuge with a chance acquaintance, the mysterious Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt in a rivetting performance). It is with Tyler that Norton's character finds a new, seemingly meaningful way to feel ""connected"": the two men fight. And fight and fight. It makes them feel ""up,"" it makes them feel real. Other men, most of them oddball or dysfunctional individuals alienated from society, join their fight club. The narrator is torn between his better instincts and the attraction of Tyler's way of life and nihilistic philosophy. As Tyler's persona becomes more and more disturbing--he has also seduced the only woman for whom the protagonist has any real feeling (well played by Helena Bonham Carter)--it becomes apparent that he, and the greatly expanded, nation-wide Fight Club, must be stopped. But how? And who, exactly, IS Tyler Durden?The decaying interiors and dark exterior shots that abound in ""Fight Club"" are wonderfully filmed in a manner slightly reminiscent of ""Blade Runner,"" and the truly fine acting by Norton and Pitt sends out sparks. Even during scenes that are in no way believable (I can't explain or I'll give away the ending), Norton effectively conveys the impression of a confused and frustrated Everyman. Pitt is dark and charismatic, and yes, he looks great, even in Tyler's hideous bathrobe and other unappealing garments.This film is not for the weak of stomach, and the conclusion may be disturbing for those who were in New York for 9/11, but it's a genuinely interesting creation. It may not be as deep and thought provoking as its most avid fans proclaim, but it is a fine piece of work, definitely worth at least one viewing.",4,Clever...fascinating...I may never buy designer soap again.,1093910400,"08 31, 2004",2004,2871,"['way', 'David', 'Fincher', 'Fight', 'Club', 'found', 'remembering', 'one', 'Barney', 'Fife', 'lines', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'Show', ""'Here"", 'Rock', 'have', 'two', 'rules', 'Rule', 'Number', 'One', 'Obey', 'rules', 'highly', 'unlikely', 'director', 'had', 'desire', 'remind', 'viewers', 'ancient', 'comedic', 'moment', 'denying', 'odd', 'flashes', 'humor', 'crop', 'here', 'there', 'film', 'Fight', 'Club', 'been', 'described', 'detractors', 'overly', 'slick', 'heavily', 'macho', 'fans', 'find', 'clever', 'visually', 'stunning', 'moments', 'real', 'brilliance', 'think', 'fans', 'have', 'got', 'right', 'are', 'moments', 'brilliance', 'can', 'deal', 'explicit', 'violence', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'watch.The', 'unnamed', 'protagonist', 'excellent', 'work', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'sad', 'sack', 'white', 'collar', 'worker', 'suffering', 'insomnia', 'drifting', 'aimlessly', 'more', 'less', 'soulless', 'environment', 'contemporary', 'urban', 'America', 'effort', 'feel', 'connected', 'something', 'anything', 'support-group', 'addict', 'religiously', 'attending', 'self-help', 'meetings', 'alcoholics', 'cancer', 'patients', 'etc.', 'etc', 'When', 'apartment', 'carefully', 'collected', 'worldly', 'goods', 'literally', 'refuge', 'chance', 'acquaintance', 'mysterious', 'Tyler', 'Durden', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'rivetting', 'performance', 'Tyler', 'Norton', 'character', 'new', 'seemingly', 'meaningful', 'way', 'feel', 'connected', 'two', 'men', 'fight', 'fight', 'fight', 'feel', 'up', 'feel', 'real', 'Other', 'men', 'most', 'oddball', 'dysfunctional', 'individuals', 'alienated', 'society', 'join', 'fight', 'club', 'narrator', 'torn', 'better', 'instincts', 'attraction', 'Tyler', 'way', 'life', 'nihilistic', 'philosophy', 'Tyler', 'persona', 'more', 'more', 'disturbing', 'also', 'seduced', 'only', 'woman', 'whom', 'protagonist', 'real', 'feeling', 'well', 'played', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'apparent', 'greatly', 'expanded', 'nation-wide', 'Fight', 'Club', 'must', 'be', 'stopped', 'how', 'who', 'exactly', 'IS', 'Tyler', 'Durden', 'decaying', 'interiors', 'dark', 'exterior', 'shots', 'abound', 'Fight', 'Club', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'filmed', 'manner', 'slightly', 'reminiscent', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'truly', 'fine', 'acting', 'Norton', 'Pitt', 'out', 'sparks', 'Even', 'scenes', 'are', 'way', 'believable', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain', ""'ll"", 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'Norton', 'effectively', 'conveys', 'impression', 'confused', 'frustrated', 'Everyman', 'Pitt', 'dark', 'charismatic', 'yes', 'great', 'even', 'Tyler', 'hideous', 'bathrobe', 'other', 'unappealing', 'garments.This', 'film', 'not', 'weak', 'stomach', 'conclusion', 'may', 'be', 'disturbing', 'who', 'were', 'New', 'York', '9/11', 'genuinely', 'interesting', 'creation', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'deep', 'thought', 'provoking', 'most', 'avid', 'fans', 'proclaim', 'fine', 'piece', 'work', 'definitely', 'worth', 'least', 'one', 'viewing']",N/A

519015,A2WZ1B92F81LJJ,B00003CWQ2,"Olly Buxton ""@electricray""","[1, 4]","First impressions count, they last, and I think they explain the overwhelmingly positive reactions of the Amazon readership to this film. The first hour of Fight Club is truly, exquisitely, brilliant: patiently (if acidly) observed, witty and deadpan, and the punches it lands - good, solid punches - are of the purely figurative kind. The first hour is nothing like what I was expecting (well, there's no fighting, for a start), so much so that I had to check I actually had the right film. But it was so good, so clever, and so funny that I really didn't mind whether I did or not.So, on the strength of that, sans doubte, five stars: Norton is beautifully understated as the nameless narrator, Helena Bonham-Carter reveals the burned out sex-kitten side of herself that previously I could only fantasise existed, and Brad Pitt, always arch and aware, is as charismatic and magnetic as anyone I've seen on screen. Because he's so cool you tend to overlook the fact that he's an extraordinary actor as well.But doubts began creeping into my mind the minute the first punch was thrown. They took a while to solidify - the game could have gone any one of a number of ways; the violence stayed intermittent and along with the punches there were some interesting (if, er, heavy handed) consumerism vs. individualism arguments getting thrown about, and there seemed to be a Brad Pitt as Jesus thread gathering pace, but suddenly everything went terribly wrong, the narrative ceased making any sense, and this clever, articulate and stylish film devolved into an ultra-violent, but otherwise pretty run-of-the-mill high-octane action movie.What happened? Well, put some of it down to Curse Of The Twist. This is a phenomenon which really only started in earnest with the Crying Game, where the twist made the film; was followed (cleverly) by the Sixth Sense and (laboriously) by the Usual Suspects, and now seems to be obligatory way of finishing off a film where what seemed a great idea when it started turned out not to be (see for example the Shawshank Redemption, Signs, and A Beautiful Mind). Problem here is that the twist completely undoes all the good work done in the first hour of the film. A picture that was making some clever points in a pretty palatable way all of a sudden just doesn't any more. And all of a sudden there are lots of guns and lots of punching. Great.And I'm not sure the twist even works (I'd have to watch it again, and to be honest I can't be bothered): the point of a twist is to give you a set of facts and imply that they should be interpreted in a certain way, and then to reveal the critical piece of information which reveals that everything must actually be viewed another way. I have a sense that some of the facts from the first half don't square with the revised scenario.This was all immensely disappointing, because this could have been a great film - I still think the first 60 minutes is a great film, but I guess if they had stopped there then, on account of the lack of fighting, they couldn't have called it ""Fight Club"".Olly Buxton",3,Ruined by a bout of Twister,1040860800,"12 26, 2002",2002,3079,"['First', 'impressions', 'count', 'last', 'think', 'explain', 'overwhelmingly', 'positive', 'reactions', 'Amazon', 'readership', 'film', 'first', 'hour', 'Fight', 'Club', 'truly', 'exquisitely', 'brilliant', 'patiently', 'acidly', 'observed', 'witty', 'deadpan', 'punches', 'good', 'solid', 'punches', 'are', 'purely', 'figurative', 'kind', 'first', 'hour', 'nothing', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'well', 'fighting', 'start', 'so', 'much', 'had', 'check', 'actually', 'had', 'right', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'so', 'clever', 'so', 'funny', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'did', 'not.So', 'strength', 'doubte', 'five', 'stars', 'Norton', 'beautifully', 'understated', 'nameless', 'narrator', 'Helena', 'Bonham-Carter', 'burned', 'out', 'sex-kitten', 'side', 'herself', 'previously', 'could', 'only', 'fantasise', 'existed', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'always', 'arch', 'aware', 'charismatic', 'magnetic', 'anyone', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'screen', 'so', 'cool', 'tend', 'overlook', 'fact', 'extraordinary', 'actor', 'well.But', 'doubts', 'began', 'creeping', 'mind', 'minute', 'first', 'punch', 'was', 'thrown', 'took', 'while', 'solidify', 'game', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'one', 'number', 'ways', 'violence', 'stayed', 'intermittent', 'punches', 'were', 'interesting', 'er', 'heavy', 'handed', 'consumerism', 'vs.', 'individualism', 'arguments', 'getting', 'thrown', 'there', 'seemed', 'be', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Jesus', 'thread', 'gathering', 'pace', 'suddenly', 'everything', 'went', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'narrative', 'ceased', 'making', 'sense', 'clever', 'articulate', 'stylish', 'film', 'devolved', 'ultra-violent', 'otherwise', 'pretty', 'run-of-the-mill', 'high-octane', 'action', 'movie.What', 'happened', 'Well', 'put', 'down', 'Curse', 'Twist', 'phenomenon', 'really', 'only', 'started', 'earnest', 'Crying', 'Game', 'where', 'twist', 'made', 'film', 'was', 'followed', 'cleverly', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'laboriously', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'now', 'be', 'obligatory', 'way', 'finishing', 'off', 'film', 'where', 'what', 'seemed', 'great', 'idea', 'when', 'started', 'turned', 'out', 'not', 'be', 'see', 'example', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'Signs', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'Problem', 'here', 'twist', 'completely', 'good', 'work', 'done', 'first', 'hour', 'film', 'picture', 'was', 'making', 'clever', 'points', 'pretty', 'palatable', 'way', 'sudden', 'just', ""n't"", 'more', 'sudden', 'are', 'lots', 'guns', 'lots', 'punching', 'Great.And', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'twist', 'even', ""'d"", 'have', 'watch', 'again', 'be', 'honest', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'bothered', 'point', 'twist', 'give', 'set', 'facts', 'imply', 'should', 'be', 'interpreted', 'certain', 'way', 'then', 'reveal', 'critical', 'piece', 'information', 'everything', 'must', 'actually', 'be', 'viewed', 'way', 'have', 'sense', 'facts', 'first', 'half', 'do', ""n't"", 'square', 'revised', 'scenario.This', 'was', 'immensely', 'disappointing', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'film', 'still', 'think', 'first', '60', 'minutes', 'great', 'film', 'guess', 'had', 'stopped', 'there', 'then', 'account', 'lack', 'fighting', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'called', 'Fight', 'Club', '.Olly', 'Buxton']",N/A

But the plot, I feel, is more action-oriented and therefore better suited for tv.The themes here will make you question everything except the immediacy of the moment, the here-and-now. Being a downshifter, living in and dealing with the consumerist system but not being of it, the many 'selves' we have (and projection of the shadow side) in a fickle-minded society going on as if they will live forever, and dying never having lived. In addition to this is the need for male initiation where fathers are deadbeats or absent outsiders, and knowing who and what you are as a self-sufficient and self-reliant individual distinct from the herd mindset - qualities which cannot be touched, bought or sold, or change on a whim (certainly not from any external influence).In his saying,""You're the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world,"" I realize the lesson here in existentialism is not about finding some ultimately materialistic (and temporary) idea of happiness, but about finding and creating meaning to one's life. I am also reminded of when he says,""It all started with Marla Singer.""

The initial story of Jack and Tyler  is utterly hilarious in its shocking tastelessness; we laugh at its plot  twists in the same sense that we laugh at the inspired rudeness of  &quot;South Park.&quot;  The violence is not so frequent OR graphic as I'd  been led to believe, because David Fincher's incredible directing makes the  violent moments both very funny at times, and at others, more disturbing  than a lot of blood and guts ever could.  You will find yourself, by turns,  both amused and horrified at the ideas and images presented in this  provocative film, and you WILL remain constantly engaged.  The  &quot;surprise ending&quot; definitely warrants at LEAST a second viewing,  but I don't feel that it holds the whole story together as sensibly as it  should... though it does do a pretty understandable and consistent job  around 95% of the time.  It's hard to fully describe and analyze  &quot;Fight Club&quot; without writing a veritable 10-page paper, but all I  can say to the easily offended is, just grow up and enter this movie with  an open mind... you'll be surprised at how interesting and responsible it  ultimately is.  The world should be glad for a director like Fincher, who  can handle material like this both intelligently and fearlessly.  The  performances of Norton, Pitt, and Carter are absolutely first-rate, and  their dialogue is utterly brilliant.  There is nothing to complain about  over this movie; instead, there should be celebration of its originality,  reverence for the talent that created it, and respect for the dangerous  ideas that it isn't afraid to confront.  Whether you love it or hate it,  there's no denying that &quot;Fight Club&quot; is one of those very few  films that you simply must see, even if only to see what all the fuss is  about!",5,Absolutely awesome,969408000,"09 20, 2000",2000,2349,"['Leave', 'quot', 'family', 'groups', 'quot', 'country', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'responsibility', 'raising', 'own', 'kids', 'file', 'so', 'many', 'loud', 'thoughtless', 'objections', 'incredible', 'movie', 'quot', 'Fight', 'Club', 'quot', 'one', 'most', 'original', 'ingeniously', 'written', 'directed', 'acted', 'films', 'come', 'very', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'ultimate', 'message', 'society', 'far', 'more', 'intelligent', 'responsible', 'critics', 'censors', 'even', 'tried', 'give', 'credit', 'would', 'have', ""'d"", 'just', '*paid', 'attention', 'it*', 'initial', 'story', 'Jack', 'Tyler', 'utterly', 'hilarious', 'shocking', 'tastelessness', 'laugh', 'plot', 'twists', 'same', 'sense', 'laugh', 'inspired', 'rudeness', 'quot', 'South', 'Park.', 'quot', 'violence', 'not', 'so', 'frequent', 'OR', 'graphic', ""'d"", 'been', 'led', 'believe', 'David', 'Fincher', 'incredible', 'directing', 'violent', 'moments', 'very', 'funny', 'times', 'others', 'more', 'disturbing', 'lot', 'blood', 'guts', 'ever', 'could', 'will', 'find', 'turns', 'amused', 'horrified', 'ideas', 'images', 'presented', 'provocative', 'film', 'WILL', 'remain', 'constantly', 'engaged', 'quot', 'surprise', 'ending', 'quot', 'definitely', 'warrants', 'LEAST', 'second', 'viewing', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'whole', 'story', 'together', 'as', 'sensibly', 'should', 'do', 'pretty', 'understandable', 'consistent', 'job', '95', '%', 'time', 'hard', 'fully', 'describe', 'analyze', 'quot', 'Fight', 'Club', 'quot', 'writing', 'veritable', '10-page', 'paper', 'can', 'say', 'easily', 'offended', 'just', 'grow', 'up', 'enter', 'movie', 'open', 'mind', ""'ll"", 'be', 'surprised', 'how', 'interesting', 'responsible', 'ultimately', 'world', 'should', 'be', 'glad', 'director', 'Fincher', 'who', 'can', 'handle', 'material', 'intelligently', 'fearlessly', 'performances', 'Norton', 'Pitt', 'Carter', 'are', 'absolutely', 'first-rate', 'dialogue', 'utterly', 'brilliant', 'nothing', 'complain', 'about', 'movie', 'instead', 'should', 'be', 'celebration', 'originality', 'reverence', 'talent', 'created', 'respect', 'dangerous', 'ideas', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'confront', 'Whether', 'love', 'hate', 'denying', 'quot', 'Fight', 'Club', 'quot', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'films', 'simply', 'must', 'see', 'even', 'only', 'see', 'what', 'fuss']",N/A

Fight Club is not only a VERY well produced DVD, but the supplemental material will keep you busy for LITERALLY hours.  You will finally have a reason to 'break in' that angle button on your remote.  As a story, Fight Club takes a more cerebral approach to ones thought processes.  Containing many cool effects, Fight Club may make the average movie viewer pop a few Excedrins while trying to figure out the point of the film.  While many may finish the movie in total confusion, mostly everyone will agree that Fight Club is a unique movie experience.  When I received the DVD package, I was instantly impressed with the graphic design of the outer package, the discs themselves and the booklet that is included.  Initially, this DVD comes off as a &quot;special edition&quot; rather then a simple &quot;movie release on DVD&quot;.  Whoever created the graphics on the cover and throughout the booklet has a very active imagination.  Disc one has the film, disc two has the supplemental material.  ** Pause the third FBI WARNING at the beginning of the disc....it is quite funny**  Disc one offers you your usual &quot;chapters&quot; choices with 'moving' scenes (like The Matrix), audio setup for Dolby surround for both a 2 speaker setups and 5.1 setups in English and Spanish.  This is also a THX certified DVD, so it includes a THX setup screen.  Disc one also gives you the choice of several audio commentaries to listen to throughout the film, including David Fincher, Bradd Pitt, Ed Norton, Helena Bonham Carter, the novelist and the screenwriter, the Director of Photography, Visual Effects Supervisor and a couple of others.  In a nutshell, you have a choice to listen to A LOT of people, a great addition to this DVD.  Picture quality of Fight Club was incredible.  Overall, the picture is moody and dark with beautiful blacks and wonderful color detail.  It is beautifully photographed with incredible shadow detail and crystal clear highlights.  Sound quality was equally impressive.  Being THX certified, you can expect nothing less then awesome.  Edward Nortons voice-over sounds very live, as though he's sitting right in front of you.  The sound has beautiful detail, with stereo separation being impressively realistic and the music and dialogue recorded incredibly well.  Surround detail is amazing with some scenes having deep bass that will make the neighbors call the cops.  Disc two will stay in your DVD player for a long time.  The supplemental material includes crew and cast information. behind the scenes of the production, the visual effects and on-location footage  with commentaires and multiple angles.......WOW!  Disc two also contains seven deleted scenes as well as trailers, TV spots, music videos, an interview with Edward Norton and a bunch of storyboards, visual effects stills, paintings and many other additions to keep your fingers happy on that remote.  The Producers of this DVD should be applauded....not only is the picture and sound quality top-notch, but the graphical elements and the supplemental materials included are fantastic and incredibly entertaining.  I highly recommend this DVD for those who enjoyed this movie in the theatre, who are curious about the film, or those simply interested in seeing what a superb DVD release is all about.

I basically enjoy all kinds of movies...action, comedy, romance, sci-fi, thrillers etc. and I rarely criticize a movie because I know the effort put in to make a movie. But every once in a while, a movie comes out that does more than entertain, it makes you think, it makes you question and it changes your perception about various things. Well, Fight Club is one of those movies. I have watched this movie many many many times and it never fails to astound me. This is in my opinion, one of the best movies to come out of Hollywood.It is basically about this guy, only known as the Narrator who is a white collar employee, working a 9 to 5 job, has his own apartment and his own collection of branded items. Sounds familiar? It's not surprising many of us can relate to this guy. Anyhow, even with all these material items, he finds his life unsatisfying, he feels that something is lacking. Because of this problem, he suffers from insomnia. He finds solace in attending those self-help sessions but soon meets another faker, Marla. The presence of another faker makes him uncomfortable and the sessions don't work for him anymore. It is then that he meets Tyler Durden, this cool, smart talking dude in a plane. This guy intrigued him and when the Narrator returns to find his apartment burnt, he turns to Tyler for help. From there on, this movie spirals to dizzying heights, with the creation of Fight Club by the Narrator and Tyler, and later what seems to be a takeover of Fight Club by Tyler leaving the Narrator clueless about what's going on.I really have to say this movie really fascinated me so much with it's intelligent ideas and dialogue, partly because deep in my heart, on some level...I can relate to the character, and although I don't agree with everything that is said, it does make me think and how many movies can do that? Fight Club to me, represents our lives in a twisted way. It challenges us to think about things in life, for example our view of success. Does working a boring job to pay for things we don't need a success? Do you experience fulfillment or do you think you're wasting your life away? (...)Everybody involved in this movie did a fantastic job but extra credit has to go to the director, writer and the actors. David Fincher has come a long way from directing music videos for Madonna. I am a huge fan and I've seen all his work, Aliens 3, Se7en, The Game and more recently Panic Room. No one but him can create an environment of decay and desperation in this movie that just grabs you. Kudos to the actors involved too. Everyone was perfectly cast. The talented Edward Norton was excellent in his role as the Narrator. He so accurately resembled the average guy that it was scary. His voice has a perfect tone for narrating the story and he reminds me of a young Kevin Spacey. If only he gets better roles, he may very well go down a legend in Hollywood. Brad Pitt has always acted in likeable hero roles as well as ""feel good"" movies and he has managed to pull it off but in many of those roles, there was nothing special or extraordinary. In this movie, he was fantastic. I consider this to be his finest work together with his role as Det. Mills in Se7en. No one but him could've pulled of Tyler Durden. When he spoke, it just didn't sound written, it sounds authentic, the words come alive...like he really lives his life that way and it's what he truly believes. Any other person might have made it less exciting but Pitt nails it. And last but not least Helena Bonham Carter as Marla was also a really good choice. She did not have much screen time, but the times she does appear..she delivers with a fine performance.There was a lot of bad publicity about this movie and although I admit this movie may not be for everyone, I loved it and so did most of my friends. I HIGHLY recommend this movie. This movie is not a renter, it's a keeper. It's movies like this that sets the bar higher for American cinema...seriously.

Brad Pitt was cool, reserved and in control or, as in control as the man who wasn't there could be.  Helena Bonham Carter was Marla in a reserved sense but, she still managed to pull it off well.  Meat Loaf Aday as Robert Paulson had a small role in the film but, it was well played and well used to support the story.The screen play was decent but, it lacked some details that helped you understand some things in the movie.For instance, the Mechanic had a larger role in the book than in this story and he helped to explain mind of Tyler Durden as well as being the man who would attempt cut off Ed Norton's Nuts (which wasn't in a police station by the way).  Also, Marla has a series of boyfriends with serious issues and she not only thought the whole split personality was cool but, actually helped Ed Norton stay awake so Tyler couldn't take over his body.  Another point is the fact that the main character realized he had multiple personalities a little more than halfway through the book as the two met in passing, and then he spent most of the rest of the book trying to undo the damage that Tyler had done.  And finally, they left out the fact that Tyler instructed them all to cut people's nuts off if they made any attempt to shutdown Fight Club in any way, and this lead to threats against police chiefs and a fridge full of frozen testicles from people attempting to stop the movement.Overall, they did do a really good job with the movie but, I still recommend you read the book as it builds upon the story and you will actually get a pretty good sense of how the story would really unfold.So, with that said, if you haven't seen this movie yet, you've been living under a rock for the past 13 years and really need to climb out from under there!",4,His Name is Robert Paulson!,1364256000,"03 26, 2013",2013,2047,"['Fight', 'Club', 'chaos', 'created', 'one', 'man', 'dissociative', 'personality', 'disorder', 'seriously', 'potential', 'Mental', 'Illness', 'pervert', 'world', 'know', 'it.The', 'acting', 'was', 'great', 'never', 'cared', 'Ed', 'Norton', 'movie', 'really', 'like', 'actor', 'now', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'was', 'cool', 'reserved', 'control', 'control', 'man', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'could', 'be', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'was', 'Marla', 'reserved', 'sense', 'still', 'managed', 'pull', 'off', 'well', 'Meat', 'Loaf', 'Aday', 'Robert', 'Paulson', 'had', 'small', 'role', 'film', 'was', 'well', 'played', 'well', 'used', 'support', 'story.The', 'screen', 'play', 'was', 'decent', 'lacked', 'details', 'helped', 'understand', 'things', 'movie.For', 'instance', 'Mechanic', 'had', 'larger', 'role', 'book', 'story', 'helped', 'explain', 'mind', 'Tyler', 'Durden', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'man', 'who', 'would', 'attempt', 'cut', 'off', 'Ed', 'Norton', 'Nuts', 'was', ""n't"", 'police', 'station', 'way', 'Also', 'Marla', 'series', 'boyfriends', 'serious', 'issues', 'not', 'only', 'thought', 'whole', 'split', 'personality', 'was', 'cool', 'actually', 'helped', 'Ed', 'Norton', 'stay', 'awake', 'so', 'Tyler', 'could', ""n't"", 'take', 'over', 'body', 'point', 'fact', 'main', 'character', 'realized', 'had', 'multiple', 'personalities', 'little', 'more', 'halfway', 'book', 'two', 'met', 'passing', 'then', 'spent', 'most', 'rest', 'book', 'trying', 'undo', 'damage', 'Tyler', 'had', 'done', 'finally', 'left', 'out', 'fact', 'Tyler', 'instructed', 'cut', 'people', 'nuts', 'made', 'attempt', 'shutdown', 'Fight', 'Club', 'way', 'lead', 'threats', 'police', 'chiefs', 'fridge', 'full', 'frozen', 'testicles', 'people', 'attempting', 'stop', 'movement.Overall', 'did', 'do', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'movie', 'still', 'recommend', 'read', 'book', 'story', 'will', 'actually', 'get', 'pretty', 'good', 'sense', 'how', 'story', 'would', 'really', 'unfold.So', 'said', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'yet', ""'ve"", 'been', 'living', 'rock', 'past', '13', 'years', 'really', 'need', 'climb', 'out']",N/A

But if you want a movie that's full of dark black humor and lines that will stay with us forever then you're in luck.  Edward Norton is at his finest playing an insomniac who goes to support groups as a means to fall asleep, and later ends up creating his own (Fight Club).  Along the way he runs into Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt's best role since True Romance) and that's when the fun really starts.  I don't want to get to into it because that would ruin some great scenes but watch for a cameo by the lead singer of Live.  The commentary is great with Edward Norton and David Fincher (Brad is pretty witty himself) but I could do without Helena Bonham Carter's commentary.  She's too full of herself and I think that she had to do it seperatlly because the others hated her... that's what I think at least.  The internet promos are cool, the public service announcements are to die for, plus the Spanish adds are cool.  You can even see a few adds they geared towards women.  There is a nice video for the Dust Brothers video (watch it after the movie) and pictures of the promo catalog that they gave out to hype the film.

What a load of crap!  It's the most anti-fascist movie I can think of.  It shows you how people who are lost in this modern world (as many of us are) can be taken advantage of by a very charismatic person with an alterior motive.  The men who are attracted to the Fight Club are dulled by their mundane and de-masculinating modern lives, so the only way they can feel alive and like men is to beat the living crap out of eachother and commit boy-hood hijinx.  It becomes their support group, their way to make life bearable in our unbearably meaningless world.  Tyler Durden (Pitt) gives them meaning and the kind of macho comradery all men want, but he uses that to take advantage of them....to turn them into ""Space Monkeys"" (Watch the movie and it will all make perfect sense).I like David Finchers work as a director, this is his best movie.  His dark style compliments the dark humor and mood of Fight Club VERY well.  I don't think any other major director could have done a better job.  (Watch out for the subliminal Tyler's in the first 20 minutes of the film, it's great.  Way to go Mr. Fincher!)Brad Pitt IS Tyler Durden!  This movie made me come out of the closet as a Brad Pitt fan, he was just great in this movie.  Edward Norton was also well cast and did a great job, but Pitt made this movie shine.Fight Club has fantasticly twisted dark humor that takes shot after shot at our culture.

On a plane ride he meets a soap salesman named Tyler Durden played by BRAD PITT. The two meet on a plane ride and Tyler gives Edward Nortons character his card. After the Narrators (Edward Norton) apartment blows up he calles Tyler hinting around that he needs a place to stay so, Tyler than invites him to stay at his place. Eventually the two start a new form of therapy by getting out there aggression and starting a underground club called FIGHT CLUB. Everything seems to be going great untill Marla Singer (played by HELENA BONHAM CARTER) gets in the way and makes a bad situation even worse. FIGHT CLUB has little to do with fighting and more to do with the way EDWARD NORTON's charater can not come to terms with his multiple personalities. I don't want to give away the plot, but if I don't give it away many of you might not give this movie a fair chance, by making preconceived notions about the film before you even see it. EDWARD NORTON's charater and BRAD PITTS character are the SAME! Edward creates Tyler Durden who is someone he sees himself as, someone with confidence, someone who takes risks, and most importantly someone who is a leader and knows where he is going! This movie will surprise you with the clues it gives you during the whole movie, yet you never seem to come to terms with what is really going on untill the end when you discover that the two lead charaters are actually the same person. This movie is in the tradtion as such classics as THREE FACES OF EVE, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, and SEVEN. This movie was over looked by so many, and being a huge BRAD PITT fan I truly believe he gave one of his BEST performances in this movie! Check it out it is a great flick and with the BONUS disc it offers 4 commentaries, 17 behind the scenes vignettes, Multiple Angles, theatrical previews and much more.

The movie was revolutionary hell i liked it better than the matrix. The thing is that it is really gritty but most good movies of the 90s were like the Tarintino films.

I dont no why but they did and of course the last frame of film they put in something interesting if your curious check it out.

In this brilliant film, a collection of low class losers become so powerful, they in literally bring cooperate America down to it's knees.  Fight club is a witty, humorous inventive film that captivates the mind, as well as the freedom that total release brings, along with slow deterioration and pointlessness an aimless life will bring.Brad Pitt delivers a comical and raw role as a free spirit intent on exposing the true horror and misdirection this material world brings.  He loves to move place to place, and to mutilate the body, to invoke a state of complete freedom and valance.  He despises the `things' such as jewelry, entertainment devices, and the economics of the current first world countries.  He in fact shows the true irony and stupidity of the wealthy when he sells rich overweight woman their own fat back to them in the form of expensive deodorant soap.Edward Norton plays the middle class hard working man, doing duty cover-ups for a deceptive car company.  When he tries to find meaning in a variety of support groups, which in turn make him feel the pain of others to mask his own empty life.  Then he finds another woman has the same idea, and that is when he begins to lose his new found solution.  After a series of business trips, he finds a witty friend and finds that he is his new best friend.After at a traumatic event, he realizes that fighting is a strangely releasing thing, and that he loses all of his fear and doubt about the future.  As the fight club grows, Edward finds that he is no longer holding such a close on his friend, as Brad begins to have an affair with his old suicidal friend. Eventually, the group spirals out of control, as does Pitt, when death exposes the group for the dangerous cult it is.It is then when Pitt disappear and seemingly starts more destructive groups in other cities when Edward Norton finds out that the battle against this insanity literally lays within his own mind.Though I did not like the twist in this movie, the ending was still satisfying, though while I was blown away by the nerve, wit, and humor during 80% of the movie.

Face it: Not everyone wants CK suits and a BMW.  However, everyone wants a sense of purpose.  Fight Club uses primordial, violent, almost sickening imagery to convey the struggle one may go through to sort through society's standards in quest of inner peace, freedom, and individuality in an increasingly materialistic world.  In the modern world, traditional values such as love, honor, devotion, patriotism, even faith are being subverted by slick marketing of desire attachments (BMW?) by international corporations.  Who says work your butt off to protect American values?  No: You work your butt off to get more things.  This film does not solve anything; it just makes you think.  And you'll think about guy things.  The masculine, logical mind has a tremendous burden in each generation.  Thus, people seeking a romantic movie are appalled, and people seeking an adventure are pleased.  The controversial ending resolved one man's life's purpose; his inner struggle was successful.

Edward Norton stars as a white-collared worker, who's an insomniac and  feels is trapped in his dead-end job. Then one day, he meets Tyler Durden  (Brad Pitt) on the airplane supposedly as a &quot;single-serving  friend&quot;. He then talks to him, learns about where he's coming from,  then finds out that he is a mysterious fellow. He meets Tyler again and is  taken into a dangerous underworld, or cult, called the Fight Club, and  soon, finds out that he is trapped and cannot escape.  As said before,  the film starts out as a satire against society today. As the whole idea of  the Fight Club flourishes in the story, the film becomes a profile of  violence and the horrific side of human anger. Finally, one more surprising  turn is taken, and the film turns into a tightly wound psychological  thriller. The film exceeds at all these levels, but not fully so. The fatal  flaw was the ending. Of all the current David Fincher films I've seen, they  are excellent, toy with your mind, but are completely diminished because of  the poor ending. I found the ending in this film to be laughably bad and  utterly stupid. &quot;Seven&quot; was a great film, but was ruined by the  ending, as was &quot;The Game&quot;. Another problem with the film was that  there was too much of the Helena Bonhamn Carter character, Marla. Many  scenes with her could have been trimmed, because her character dragged the  film a bit. but the flaws were overpowered by a strong script, strong  characterizations, great acting and photography, and many great moments.  The idea of the fight club is inventive and highly fascinating. Edward  Norton plays his character with energy and belief, and never lets down.  This really shines on Brad Pitt as one of his greatest, if not, his  greatest job of acting, as the multi-dimensional god-like Tyler Durden.  Though the film takes many turns, the message still remains this:  anti-Society, as seen through a group of lost souls, who never had any  direction in life to go, were spat on and rejected from society, and could  not fit into the world.",4,Fight Club,960508800,"06 9, 2000",2000,2222,"['David', 'Fincher', 'quot', 'Fight', 'Club', 'quot', 'out', 'satire', 'modern', 'society', 'claiming', 'how', 'programmed', 'materialistic', 'world', 'become', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'white-collared', 'worker', 'who', 'insomniac', 'feels', 'trapped', 'dead-end', 'job', 'Then', 'one', 'day', 'Tyler', 'Durden', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'airplane', 'supposedly', 'quot', 'single-serving', 'friend', 'quot', 'then', 'where', 'coming', 'then', 'out', 'mysterious', 'fellow', 'Tyler', 'again', 'taken', 'dangerous', 'underworld', 'cult', 'called', 'Fight', 'Club', 'soon', 'out', 'trapped', 'can', 'not', 'escape', 'As', 'said', 'film', 'out', 'satire', 'society', 'today', 'whole', 'idea', 'Fight', 'Club', 'story', 'film', 'profile', 'violence', 'horrific', 'side', 'human', 'anger', 'Finally', 'one', 'more', 'surprising', 'turn', 'taken', 'film', 'tightly', 'wound', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'film', 'exceeds', 'levels', 'not', 'fully', 'so', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'was', 'ending', 'current', 'David', 'Fincher', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'are', 'excellent', 'toy', 'mind', 'are', 'completely', 'diminished', 'poor', 'ending', 'found', 'ending', 'film', 'be', 'laughably', 'bad', 'utterly', 'stupid', 'quot', 'Seven', 'quot', 'was', 'great', 'film', 'was', 'ruined', 'ending', 'was', 'quot', 'Game', 'quot', 'problem', 'film', 'was', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'Helena', 'Bonhamn', 'Carter', 'character', 'Marla', 'Many', 'scenes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'trimmed', 'character', 'dragged', 'film', 'bit', 'flaws', 'were', 'overpowered', 'strong', 'script', 'strong', 'characterizations', 'great', 'acting', 'photography', 'many', 'great', 'moments', 'idea', 'fight', 'club', 'inventive', 'highly', 'fascinating', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'character', 'energy', 'belief', 'never', 'down', 'really', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'one', 'greatest', 'not', 'greatest', 'job', 'acting', 'multi-dimensional', 'god-like', 'Tyler', 'Durden', 'film', 'many', 'turns', 'message', 'still', 'anti-Society', 'seen', 'group', 'lost', 'souls', 'who', 'never', 'had', 'direction', 'life', 'go', 'were', 'spat', 'rejected', 'society', 'could', 'not', 'fit', 'world']",N/A

This movie was billed as being about  fighting, but its really about the human soul and the box of  conventionality in which we keep it locked.

The great depression is our lives.' For Durden, consumerism and the  American dream is the enemy.

For that reason, I did not see this at the theater, I could of but I did not. However, now that I viewed it on DVD, I have a new apprecation for the actor. He brought to this film, a street wise, who gives a damn attitude that made this film what it is. I can not say I am going to run out and see every film of his after seeing this, but just give apprecation. Edward Norton, well I have been a fan of his for a while. Supporting People vs. Larry Flynt, Keeping the Faith amoung others. So that was an even and great match to me.The film has so many twists and turns that it will keep your head spinning. I went in to this film, awaiting a hoorid movie, and came out thinking what a great job. The black humor sticks all throughout the film. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt make a club, a fight club were they can get their pent-up, oppressed anger out, the natural way, no drugs needed, maybe a beer and a smoke after words. If you do not understand the plot, it is as simple as that. Well not really, it actually more clogged and eroded than you can imagine.The DVD review...This DVD is packed, leaving anyone with a smile on their face.

Not only is it a great movie in it's own right, but the message it espouses is something everyone needs to hear.As Brad Pitt says in the movie, ""You are not your job, you are not the clothes you wear..."" An anti-materialism theme rings loudly throughout the movie, and it's something everyone should think about. ""It is when we have nothing that we are free to do anything.""Some reviews said the movie is fascist. That is wrong. If anything, the movie has a Communistic flavor. The party works together for the betterment of the people working in it. They all live together and work in shifts to mutually help the other party members. Their ultimate goal is to bring down the corporations and dissolve the state, aka the bourgeoisie. And as the group demonstrates in the scene with the Chief of Police, it is the working class, everyone around you, that is responsible.But don't let a fear of Communism get in the way of you watching this movie. The other themes and messages are important as well. Not only that, but it's just a darn good movie, with a great surprise ending.The DVD comes packed with hours upon hours of extra footage, including 4 full-length commentaries and a plethora of deleted scenes and behind-the-scenes vignettes.The bottom line is: see the movie.

But, it is well shot, with great performances from Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, Elizabeth Bonham-Carter, and Meatloaf.Edward Norton plays a professional and frequent traveler, who lives alone and without personal aims. A chance meeting with Brad Pitt's character sets things in action, and the two men form a bond through fighting, and then by setting up a ""fight club"". The fighting is a way of release for people who feel disconnected and overly controlled in their lives...but it represents also the deeper problems in society, and the urge to fight back against them. The fight club begins to take on a life of its own, with Brad Pitt's character forging a more sinister purpose for the group. The situation spirals out of Norton's control, and he tries desperately to pull things back...when he encounters the true nature of Pitt's character.Meatloaf dons man-breasts...that takes courage.

While I hated the film for it's violent content, I liked the quality of the story and the  outstanding performances by Brad Pitt, Ed Norton, and Helena Bonham Carter.  Any film that makes &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; look like a Disney  movie is a film that is truly not for everyone. My immediate reaction after  seeing this film was that I would not encourage anyone to see this film,  nor would I even want to review it for fear that it might spark someone to  want to see it. I don't think I have ever seen a more violent movie nor do  I ever want to see one. &quot;Fight Club&quot; is truly in a class by  itself. It is a film that you would not want to take a date to, nor is it a  film that will entertain you...I can't imagine someone running down to the  local Blockbuster and picking it up for a quiet evening at home. I am not  one for censorship nor am I one for banning a film, but I would seriously  question the judgement of someone who viewed this film and considered it  entertainment. The story centers around the relationship of two people,  Pitt and Norton, and the enjoyment they get from beating the  &quot;heck&quot; out of each other. They fight not for sport, but for the  pure enjoyment they feel from the pain they inflict upon others and in  return have inflicted upon them.

This is not just a story of rebellion and self-destructive philosophy to find some strange form of enlightenment.  This is not just silly lines and guys fighting violently.  Not just sex.  Not just insanity.  This is certainly not a story of freedom.There is a political and social message I've noticed not many people are recieving.  It's a poke at every radical out there who fights against &quot;the Establishment&quot; or the &quot;Man.&quot;  Watch this movie again.  Fight Club begins as something innocent, a way to rebel against standardized norms of pleasure.  What it transforms into is a terrorist regime.  Sure, in Fight Club they managed to escape from enslaving jobs and the &quot;oppression&quot; of modern suburbia through this unsanctioned variety of rituals.  But in Project Mayhem, the innocence of rebellion turns into e x a c t l y what they tried to escape from.  It's all right there in the mantra of Project Mayhem: &quot;Sir, we do not ask questions in Project Mayhem, Sir.&quot;  They become Space Monkeys, like the slaves to nine-to-fivers, the old lives they think they've destroyed.  Everything comes back to where it started.  The rebels form their own chains of self-oppression.  In order to rebel, they must establish a conformist society (Project Mayhem).  They lose their names and personal identities--exactly what they hated about regular society and jobs that lead to anonymity and industrial disallusionment.  The means to usurpation are different, but the underlying bases of Project Mayhem are just as empty and disgusting as the real world's foundations. I suppose this, like many great films of our era, would be easily misinterpreted by the idiots looking for blood and violence, and stupid lines.  Critics looking for sub-par Titanics.  The empty-minded award givers who gave Michael Caine (Michae Caine!) an Academy Award for one of hte worst written, acted, and directed movies ever--Cider House Rules.  (Let us not forget: &quot;What's your business, boy!) I am a writer and an artist and philosopher--Fight Club appealed to all three facets of my being.To all the kids who started their own fight clubs, and you'd be surprised at how many actually did--the idiots--I say this: actually read into the movie.  If you have any ability to interpret intelligent symbols, you will see past what everyone else praises emptily.

519067,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00003CWQ2,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Fight Club (David Fincher, 1999)[originally posted 13Oct2000]Fight Club is one hundred thirty-nine minutes long. It would, perhaps, have been better served by being one hundred thirty-four minutes long. Right up until the last five minutes, Fincher was angling to become another of the directors to have more than one film on my hundred-best list (a quick run-through shows he'd be the ninth, but don't quote me on that)*. That said, I'm going to focus on those first hundred thirty-four minutes.I had some problems for the first half-hour or so with the Bret Ellis-esque fascination with brand names (excepting, of course, the wonderfully clever scene in which Fincher populates Norton's character's condo with catalog pages), but once I realized that Palahniuk was actually going somewhere with his brand-consciousness mayhem, it stopped being annoying. (Memo to Bret Easton Ellis: learn something.) The dialogue and the narration were both clever, witty, and in places laugh-out-loud funny. Fincher, as is his wont, keeps things atmospherically dark and claustrophobic, and all of it adds up to a powder keg with a bunch of small compartments ringing the big one. Little jolts hit now and then, mostly connected in some way to Marla (Helena Bonham Carter, in an extremely unexpected role) and her relationships with Tyler Durden and the narrator.For those who may have been living in a cave the last year and a half, a quick synopsis: Norton, a nameless corporate drone (the corporate version of a claims adjuster, in essence), meets the enigmatic Tyler Durden on a flight from one generic city to another. Durden is everything the narrator is not; mysterious, ebullient, straightforward. The two become fast friends after a freak accident blows the narrator's condo apart. (The astute cinemagoer should already be seeing the parallels to the underrated Lowe/Spader flick Bad Influence.) As part of the deal Durden strikes with the narrator in exchange for letting the narrator crash at his place, Durden asks the narrator to hit him. The two get involved in a fight, and the narrator, a support-group addict, realizes how liberating it can be to simply fight. Eventually, the street brawls the two get into regularly start attracting others who are drawn to this brand of redemption through violence, and Fight Club is begun.Despite the trailers for the film and my expectations after seeing Fincher's earlier work, the amount of violence in here is kept to about the minimum it has to be to get the point across; there are only two or three scenes that actually cause winces. More surprising was the film's comedic aspect; I laughed out loud a few times while alone, something that rarely happens when watching movies. It all comes together perfectly, the archetypal modern tragedy brought stylishly down to the level of metatheatre during the film's climax... and then it all goes belly-up. One imagines (gleefully, it must be said) Aristophanes or Sophocles rising from the grave to smack Fincher across the head with a skeletal hand and growl &#34;what the hell were you THINKING?&#34;Still, unlike usual, I refuse to let the last five minutes of this film deter me from singing the praises of the first two hours plus. Script, direction, casting (did I really forget to mention Meat Loaf? The man was fantastic... and I really have to say, I don't care if it IS his real last name, &#34;Meat Loaf Aday&#34; is even funnier...), setting, cinematography, it was all fantastic. Tarantino meets Hitchcock with a dash of John Ford thrown in. But then ending keeps it from reaching the heights it deserves. **** ed. note 9Dec2013: Dario Argento, David Cronenberg, John Frankenheimer, William Friedkin, Alfred Hitchcock, Sidney Lumet, Takashi Miike, Yasujiro Ozu, George A. Romero, Martin Scorsese, B&eacute;la Tarr, Orson Welles, and Billy Wilder (thirteen, if you don&#8217;t feel like counting) are all represented in the Top 100 by two films apiece.

519069,A38G64S5VMRI1P,B00003CWQ2,Robert Graves,"[13, 26]","A preacher once prayed, ""Lord, please give me a good sermon to go with this joke."" Likewise, I can imagine Fight Club's writer praying for a good movie to go with his plot twist. But if this was his prayer, it went unanswered.Meet ""The Narrator,"" played masterfully by Ed Norton, who is a deeply troubled young man working for a major auto manufacturer assessing whether recalls on defective auto parts will exceed the cost of all the lawsuits that could result. The Narrator initially has two problems, an insatiable materialism and insomnia, the latter of which he eases by going to various self-help groups for afflictions he doesn't actually have, ranging from testicular cancer to brain parasites. Once he allows himself to cry at a meeting, he can finally sleep again. But trouble rises further when The Narrator meets Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), another fraud in the support group racket. The Narrator is unable to focus at the groups in her presence, being reminded of his own lie. Marla, looking like a rejected kewpie doll, agrees to attend on different nights so as not to disturb him. The tone of sexual confusion is obvious even this far into the movie, from characters such as Bob (Meat Loaf Aday), who has lost his testicles and since developed breasts. If it sounds like I'm describing a new Woody Allen movie, just read on.Enter soap salesman Tyler Durden, portrayed by a rougher tougher Brad Pitt doing his 12-Monkeys schtick. The two meet on an airplane and it becomes immediately apparent what is brewing: Tyler is everything The Narrator isn't. He's rugged, handsome, and very bold with his words, spouting off the post-modernist nihilism that this movie aspires to. After a very brief and witty exchange, Tyler leaves The Narrator with only a business card.It's not long before these two friends are reunited. The Narrator returns to his apartment to find that it has exploded in his absence, and homeless, he calls Tyler and they go out for a beer. Their night out ends in the parking lot with Tyler telling The Narrator, ""I want you to hit me as hard as you can."" And thus is born the Fight Club. It begins with only The Narrator and Tyler, but quickly it expands to include hundreds of men in many franchises across the country. Their motive? Simple: To beat the piss out of each other in order to experience a realness they can't get anywhere else. Apparently it's only in pain that we are truly aware of ourselves.Things quickly turn south, however. Tyler starts a lecherous relationship with Marla, troubling The Narrator deeply. And then the Fight Club itself gets skewed when the men who were once only adrenaline-filled over-grown boys fighting it out turn militant, joining Tyler's ultra-secret ""Project Mayhem"" team. They all live in Tyler's dilapidated house and perform various assignments from destroying corporate art and franchise coffee bars, to urinating in restaurant-goer's soup and inserting porn clips into children's movies at the theatre, with Tyler continuously spewing his anti-capitalistic philosophy all over the audience's lap. The members of Project Mayhem feel as though they are at last real individuals, although they are engaging in mindless cult-like activities.Circumstances begin to spin out of control, and just when you think the plot couldn't be any more derailed, enter The Gratuitous Plot Twist, that staple of recent flicks, to shock (trick) the audience into thinking this is a deep and enigmatic movie.Deep? Enigmatic? I'm not buying it, friends. What director David Fincher (Seven, The Game) and writer Chuck Palahnuik have created is in my opinion art for the sake of being artistic. While some critics would hail this as genius, don't be taken in. It is much more difficult to write a real story with real characters. It is much more difficult to tell a story that is supposed to be believable rather than one that is almost entirely symbolic. Films such as Fight Club take the easy way out by exploring surreal themes - if it's uncharted and undefined, then how can they do it wrong? They can rest assured that it will appeal to at least one underground coterie. The real challenge would have been for Fincher and Palahnuik to delve into the topics of masculinity and nihilism from a more traditional story format. If an avant-garde movie such as Fight Club is to be given credence, it needs to be superbly beyond superb.And, alas, Fight Club, while containing some good one-liners and excellent acting, never gets off the ground despite taking a giant leap. The average movie-goer will wonder what this film is supposed to be. A commentary on manhood? Mr. Mom did a better job. Is it a comedy as Palahnuik himself suggests? I'm not laughing. Is it a moral critique? I hope not - ""capitalism is bad, but urinating in soup and putting porn in Cinderella is good,""?I don't want to take everything away from the film - there were certainly some clever aspects. For one, Tyler's home-made soap is fashioned from human fat, which he sells to high-end department stores. What we have then is people reveling (washing) in their own refuse (fat), Tyler's main message throughout the movie. And the acting is not to be questioned, but would we expect otherwise from Norton and Pitt?Unfortunately, though, Fight Club seems to fall on the very grounds on which it tries to stand - what it attempts to say is undermined by what it actually is. It is nothing more than a product of the very attitudes it aspires to spurn in the film. Overdone visual effects, gratuitous violence, unabashed sex scenes - does this sound like the movie of a true reformer or a good ol' boy looking for fun on a Saturday night? It's very hard to take the movie's message seriously, especially when it makes the trendy accusation against materialistic values, but only offers fascist ideals in their stead. I don't think Fight Club is going to produce any proselytes to its counterfeit grown-up suggestions, since one would almost have to already be a cemented nihilist to sit through it. But it should be enough to trick a few intellectuals into thinking that they alone bear the burden of ""getting it."" I fear Fight Club is destined to become nothing more than a scar on Fincher's otherwise excellent resume.",2,A swing and a miss,970876800,"10 7, 2000",2000,6256,"['preacher', 'once', 'prayed', 'Lord',

Eventually, by meeting Tyler Durden (Pitt), he joins the Club that gives him the best sense of belonging.  A club of men who fight, who are insanely violent to one another, who are bound together by an oath, yet secret as they are, they become incredibly popular.  They become an organized group of men who are closer than a military unit, with initiation rituals that would drive some people insane.Durden proposes an evangelical nihilism and wants to spread it everywhere.  Meaning is only what you give it, no matter if it is completely violent and acts against your own conscience.  And this is the purpose ofd fighting for its own sake.Make no mistake, this movie is dark, violent and disturbing.  Yet is seems to appeal in some way to our desire to ask questions about how one gives meaning to themselves or to anything of which they are a member.  What makes us feel alive?  Do the means to feel this way justify that end?In opposition to American Beauty - a film that also espouses a kind of nihilistic tendency - this film is open and honest, brutally honest, in telling you where such a belief could very well take you.  One can believe that Durden is a realistic character.Then there is the twist near the ending.  I won't give it away.  In some ways I liked it because it was as shocking, or even more so, than the ending to The Sixth Sense.  And I like to be shocked.  It turned the movie completely around.  On the other hand I think what it did was take away from the honesty of where the nihilistic philosophy could take you, and instead puts it in the realm of insanity rather than reality.  And that was just a a bit of a cop out to me.  That is the only thing that kept me from giving this a full 5 stars.",4,"An incredible, daring film",973209600,"11 3, 2000",2000,2061,"[""'d"", 'heard', 'hype', 'film', 'yet', 'never', 'really', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'getting', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'violence', 'mean', 'look', 'name', 'knew', 'really', 'loved', 'Edward', 'Norton.I', 'was', 'means', 'interrupted', 'Watching', 'man', 'played', 'Norton', 'tried', 'find', 'meaning', 'groups', 'people', 'times', 'getting', 'more', 'more', 'wacky', 'Eventually', 'meeting', 'Tyler', 'Durden', 'Pitt', 'Club', 'best', 'sense', 'belonging', 'club', 'men', 'who', 'fight', 'who', 'are', 'insanely', 'violent', 'one', 'who', 'are', 'bound', 'together', 'oath', 'yet', 'secret', 'are', 'become', 'incredibly', 'popular', 'become', 'organized', 'group', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'closer', 'military', 'unit', 'initiation', 'rituals', 'would', 'drive', 'people', 'insane.Durden', 'evangelical', 'nihilism', 'spread', 'everywhere', 'Meaning', 'only', 'what', 'give', 'matter', 'completely', 'violent', 'acts', 'own', 'conscience', 'purpose', 'ofd', 'fighting', 'own', 'sake.Make', 'mistake', 'movie', 'dark', 'violent', 'disturbing', 'appeal', 'way', 'desire', 'ask', 'questions', 'how', 'one', 'meaning', 'anything', 'are', 'member', 'What', 'feel', 'alive', 'Do', 'means', 'feel', 'way', 'end', 'opposition', 'American', 'Beauty', 'film', 'also', 'kind', 'nihilistic', 'tendency', 'film', 'open', 'honest', 'brutally', 'honest', 'telling', 'where', 'belief', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'take', 'One', 'can', 'believe', 'Durden', 'realistic', 'character.Then', 'twist', 'ending', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'ways', 'liked', 'was', 'shocking', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'ending', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'like', 'be', 'shocked', 'turned', 'movie', 'completely', 'other', 'hand', 'think', 'what', 'did', 'was', 'take', 'away', 'honesty', 'where', 'nihilistic', 'philosophy', 'could', 'take', 'instead', 'realm', 'insanity', 'rather', 'reality', 'was', 'just', 'bit', 'cop', 'only', 'thing', 'kept', 'giving', 'full', '5', 'stars']",N/A

519075,AM4ZQJ0IORVWG,B00003CWQ2,"Rob ""Revuman""","[6, 8]","Ok, before I get too far into this review, let me mention that this is one of those movies that you are either going to love or hate.  Some people will love it because of its very black, sometimes cynical comedic style  while others will hate it because of its ""supposed"" glorification of  fighting and its farfetched concepts.  And this is the point of the movie,  to make you think rather than to make you love it.  That's what makes this  movie so great; there are no restrictions, no censorship, and no lies.  The  movies tells things in a way that is unrestricted, which makes everything  more vivid and more powerful than if it had been made around the  aspirations of the audience it wished to draw into the movie theater.  And  although people will certainly have their opinions, I believe that this  illustration of the freedom of movie making puts it right up there with  cult classics like Blade Runner and others.First off, the Script is a  thing of beauty.  Not only is it filled with very dark images all set in a  comedic tone, but it also illustrates perfectly the message that the movie  is trying to portray.  It also has that uniqueness to it that separates  Fight Club from all other previous movies.  It isn't just a rehashing of  old ideas but a unification of many radical ones in order to form an  original plot and idea, which translates into a genre-breaking film.  Fight  Club itself is part action, part black comedy, part mystery, part thriller,  and part insanity.  In this way it makes it difficult to compare to any  previous movie because it is so different from anything that I have seen or  that has been produced in the past.The acting is also top notch.  Brad  Pitt is, out of all the characters, the one who holds the screen the best.  His role as Tyler Durdin, the strange yet sharp alter-ego friend Jack  (Norton), is one of strength, craziness, class, style, and intelligence, is  hard to miss and is a classic Pitt performance, similar in style to that of  his crazy portrayal of the inmate in 12 monkeys.  Although Norton does a  good job as Jack, the narrator, in the film, he doesn't have the same kind  of flare or presence that Pitt carries throughout the film.  And, at times,  he sound like the little kid who's always being pressured into doing the  `bad things' during recess hour.  Then there is Helena Bonham Carter, who  shines as the crazed and slightly neurotic love interest of Pitt and  Norton.  Although her presence in the movie isn't huge, her placement in  certain scenes is vital to the forward motion of the plot and the entire  movie in general.Also, one reason to get the DVD rather than the VHS is  that you get tons of extra, for lack of a better word, stuff on the second  CD like behind the scenes footage, deleted scenes, audio commentaries,  storyboards, and more.  If you love to see the insides of a movie and find  out more about why the director or the producer or actors did certain  things then you'll love all these extras.All in all, regardless of  which one you buy, you will end up seeing a movie unlike any you have ever  seen...I guarantee it.  Director David Fincher's look at the underground  world is both slick and startling and anyone who calls him or herself a  movie buff has to give this movie a chance.  Even if you're reluctant to  let it grow on you, I promise that once you take the step to pop the movie  in your VCR or DVD player you won't be disappointed...I know I wasn't.RevuMan:  Ground control to Major Tom...sorry, could think of any relative  words of wisdom...oh well...Peace!",5,A most controversial masterpiece,961113600,"06 16, 2000",2000,3582,"['Ok', 'get', 'too', 'far', 'review', 'let', 'mention', 'one', 'movies', 'are', 'either', 'going', 'love', 'hate', 'people', 'will', 'love', 'very', 'black', 'sometimes', 'cynical', 'comedic', 'style', 'others', 'will', 'hate', 'supposed', 'glorification', 'fighting', 'farfetched', 'concepts', 'point', 'movie', 'make', 'think', 'rather', 'make', 'love', 'what', 'movie', 'so', 'great', 'are', 'restrictions', 'censorship', 'lies', 'movies', 'tells', 'things', 'way', 'unrestricted', 'everything', 'more', 'vivid', 'more', 'powerful', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'aspirations', 'audience', 'wished', 'draw', 'movie', 'theater', 'people', 'will', 'certainly', 'have', 'opinions', 'believe', 'illustration', 'freedom', 'movie', 'making', 'right', 'up', 'there', 'cult', 'classics', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'others.First', 'off', 'Script', 'thing', 'beauty', 'Not', 'only', 'filled', 'very', 'dark', 'images', 'set', 'comedic', 'tone', 'also', 'perfectly', 'message', 'movie', 'trying', 'portray', 'also', 'uniqueness', 'Fight', 'Club', 'other', 'previous', 'movies', ""n't"", 'just', 'rehashing', 'old', 'ideas', 'unification', 'many', 'radical', 'ones', 'order', 'form', 'original', 'plot', 'idea', 'genre-breaking', 'film', 'Fight', 'Club', 'part', 'action', 'part', 'black', 'comedy', 'part', 'mystery', 'part', 'thriller', 'part', 'insanity', 'way', 'difficult', 'compare', 'previous', 'movie', 'so', 'different', 'anything', 'have', 'seen', 'been', 'produced', 'past.The', 'acting', 'also', 'top', 'notch', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'characters', 'one', 'who', 'screen', 'best', 'role', 'Tyler', 'Durdin', 'strange', 'yet', 'sharp', 'alter-ego', 'friend', 'Jack', 'Norton', 'one', 'strength', 'craziness', 'class', 'style', 'intelligence', 'hard', 'miss', 'classic', 'Pitt', 'performance', 'similar', 'style', 'crazy', 'portrayal', 'inmate', '12', 'monkeys', 'Norton', 'good', 'job', 'Jack', 'narrator', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'kind', 'flare', 'presence', 'Pitt', 'film', 'times', 'little', 'kid', 'who', 'always', 'being', 'pressured', 'doing', 'bad', 'things', 'recess', 'hour', 'Then', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'who', 'crazed', 'slightly', 'neurotic', 'love', 'interest', 'Pitt', 'Norton', 'presence', 'movie', ""n't"", 'huge', 'placement', 'certain', 'scenes', 'vital', 'forward', 'motion', 'plot', 'entire', 'movie', 'general.Also', 'one', 'reason', 'get', 'DVD', 'rather', 'VHS', 'get', 'tons', 'extra', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'stuff', 'second', 'CD', 'scenes', 'footage', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'storyboards', 'more', 'love', 'see', 'insides', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'why', 'director', 'producer', 'actors', 'did', 'certain', 'things', 'then', ""'ll"", 'love', 'extras.All', 'regardless', 'one', 'buy', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'seeing', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'guarantee', 'Director', 'David', 'Fincher', 'look', 'underground', 'world', 'slick', 'startling', 'anyone', 'who', 'movie', 'buff', 'give', 'movie', 'chance', 'Even', ""'re"", 'reluctant', 'let', 'grow', 'promise', 'once', 'take', 'step', 'pop', 'movie', 'VCR', 'DVD', 'player', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'know', ""wasn't.RevuMan"", 'Ground', 'control', 'Major', 'Tom', 'sorry', 'could', 'think', 'relative', 'words', 'wisdom', 'oh', 'well', 'Peace']",N/A

519078,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00003CWQ2,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 4]","The `machismo factor,' though it lies at the root of virtually every shoot-em-up war film, western and action picture Hollywood has ever  produced, has, strangely enough, gone largely unexamined in films as a  subject itself. `Fight Club' becomes one of the first movies to actually  address the issue, bluntly and directly. Before it eventually spins out of  control, this provocative film audaciously confronts a disturbing, but  truly pertinent anthropological issue: in a society that, for purposes of  its own survival, actively discourages violent behavior, is it possible for  a man, conditioned by eons of innate but ever increasingly repressed  `hunter/gatherer' instincts, to ever cut himself loose and be true to his  real nature? And if he doesn't, can he be said to ever be a `real man,' or  is he simply a hollow shell allowing society to determine what he values  and how he lives?Edward Norton stars as Jack, a man so softened by the  amenities of a modern technological culture that he has even replaced  pornography with the IKEA catalogue. As far from his barbaric ancestral  roots as any man worthy of the label can be, Jack has turned to haunting  feel-good support groups to fill the void his empty life devoted to  meaningless culture-driven values has created for him. Suddenly, into his  life walks Tyler (Brad Pitt), a sardonic, tough talking thug, the total  antithesis to Jack and a man completely in touch with his male-based  instinctive need for simple hand-to-hand physical confrontation. Together,  the two set up an underground club designed to give men like Jack the  opportunity to beat the living crud out of each other and therein find  their way back to their true primordial selves.Not only does `Fight  Club' explore a fascinating and long-overdue theme, it insidiously lures us  in to the glamorous excitement of the fight scenes themselves. Much as we  may resist their pull, we are so appalled by the alternative we are shown  in the form of Jack's drearily routine office environment, the stifling  conformity of his decorator-influenced, perfectly coordinated apartment and  the self-aggrandizing emotionalism of the many support groups he visits  that we feel as liberated as he does by the simple physical aggression of  the unregulated bouts. This is the genius of the film: it makes us just as  cognizant of the compromises we ourselves routinely make to social norms as  it does Jack. What is most impressive is that the film could easily have  turned into just another cautionary tale, a violent tract warning us of the  dangers of allowing these instincts to run amok. Instead, the filmmakers  have been careful to keep most of the activity in the realm of  self-contained mano-a-mano confrontations. In fact, the club members do not  employ guns, and, for the most part, scrupulously avoid hurting innocent  bystanders or killing anyone. (Just for the record, this controversial work  is actually a much less violent film than most of what passes for benign  action cinema these days). Although there are a few steps taken by the  group in the direction of involving outsiders in provoked fights and  eventually detonating some empty buildings - these are, by the way, the  least authentic sections of the film - the violence really doesn't extend  much beyond the confines of the club itself. Thus we are spared the  tiresome moralizing one might expect from a film exploring this  theme.Where, then, does the film ultimately come out on this issue? Is  `Fight Club' a socially irresponsible call for the unfettered use of  violence to create societal chaos, or is it a sly black comic vision of a  world gone crazy intended to highlight the dangers of just such a  situation? The answer to that question is really not an easy one to come  by, for the film itself loses its way in its final half hour. Having set up  this fascinating premise, `Fight Club' decides, rather inexplicably, to go  the sci-fi route, setting up a Jekyll and Hyde situation that both  undercuts the seriousness of the theme and spells the message out in far  too simplistic terms. Also, unlike in `The Sixth Sense,' the surprise  turnabout ending doesn't make sense in the logical context of the story.  Are we to actually assume that Jack has been fighting HIMSELF all this  time? It is true that the dark comedy flavor that runs throughout the film  does create a world where the improbable can be made possible. But the  suspension of disbelief required by the final acts of this film places far  too heavy a burden on the audience to make the drastic shift in tone truly  work.Special note should indeed be made of the extraordinary  performances of Brad Pitt and Edward Norton. Pitt, in one of his finest  roles to date, conveys the macho hard-edged physicality and sardonic charm  necessary to lure these men to his way of thinking. Norton always keeps his  character focused and life-sized, allowing Tyler to exploit these inner  yearnings yet remaining enough on the outside to continually question the  validity of his actions.`Fight Club,' for all its imperfections and  moments of confusion, deserves credit for finally attempting to explore a  theme too often exploited but rarely examined by Hollywood. The film  provides some real food for thought and, in all honesty, how many movies  can you truly say that about?",4,flawed but brilliant film,964483200,"07 25, 2000",2000,5360,"['machismo', 'factor',

I wanted to see it because I thought it would be a film based on organized, underground, raw violence and in a sense it was, but the first time I viewed the movie in its original theatrical release I didn't quite understand. After I finished watching, it set my mind into motion. I was asking myself what the point of the whole thing was. I knew I had to have a copy for my own. After careful viewing the second time, the entire film seemed richer and less disorganized. The focus was no longer on the 5 or so fighting scenes, it was about a deeper message. I know that other diehard Fight Club fans know what i'm talking about, a revolution in thought.Don't get the wrong idea , this movie isn't great just because of the fighting. It has loads of comedy! I admit it's not Naked Gun, but there is subtle and blatant humor throughout the film. It is truely enjoyable to watch.After 5 or 6 viewings it literally becomes a cult film. You start to believe the ideas presented in the movie, and you start to act out those ideas. I don't mean picking fights with strangers on the street, everything you do is affected.

Ocean's Eleven, Snatch, Fight Club, Seven...all amazing flicks.  But I'll tell you...Fight Club is the best movie ever made.  Here are eight reasons why:1) You cannot categorize this movie, it's everything.  It's action, it's drama, it's supsenseful as anything in some parts, it's funny, and it's horrifyingly graphic.2) I've noticed something different all 123258005 times I have watched it.  I know, I know, the number is what I like to call an exaggeration.  But seriously, I have picked up something new that makes the plot even more extreme each time I have watched it.  ... I have seen this movie probably at least 150 times, seriously.  I am so sad.3) It's brilliant.  All these people keep bashing it as dangerous and demented.  How about thought-provoking?  How about a new angle on the world?  How about a message to go against everything you believe and just listen?  How about the fact that there's millions of movies like that with those themes, but Fight Club does it differently?4) Edward Norton is my favorite actor.  It's just a piece of the puzzle.  Ever since I saw American History X, I knew that this guy was for real.  You wanna know why he gets almost zero publicity?  He chooses not to.  He thinks it would interfere with how you saw his characters if you knew the real him.  Wow, now that is conviction to your career.5) The soundtrack is the finest soundtrack that any movie has put out.  The only soundtracks that come close are Terminator II and The Mothman Prophecies.6) This movie was flawlessly written.  If I could write a movie like this, you wouldn't see me critiquing someone else's genius on this website.7) The pure fairy boy gets destroyed.  Usually, fairy boys win.  The fairy boy in this movie...how he looks after the...well, watch it.  You'll see what I mean.8) David Fincher is brilliant.  Um, that's all.Watch this movie, and your brain will hate you the first time you watch it.  But isn't that supposed to be what watching movies is about?  Stimulation that interests your eyes and your brain?  Please watch this.  Do yourself a favor and buy it.  Don't just rent it.

The plot revolves around a young man and a new friend with whom he starts up a fighting club for men.  However, contrary to the previews as  shown in theaters, the film is about a lot more than just a bunch of guys  fighting.  It explores some very troubling themes--the shadow, consumerism  and its deflection of our spiritual drives, alienation and lonliness in  urban culture, the repression of our basic instincts--just to name a few.The cinematography is stunning and uses a techique employed by the  character Tyler Durden in the film:  Tyler, in his job as a theater  projectionist, splices pornographic one-frame shots into the films he runs.  Watch Fight Club closely--there are two places where a fleeting shot  appears, once about 15 minutes into the film, another at the very end.  This end shot undercuts the rather schmaltzy Hollywood closing image in a  sarcastically humorous way.And that's another great aspect of this  film--the anti-social humor, which will not appeal to all tastes, but which  is brilliantly carried off.  Just seeing Brad Pitt in his filthy bathrobe  with the appliqued coffee cups all over it is funny.Pitt's acting is wonderful, so is Ed Norton's.....and the two  of them together make a synergy which is very powerful.  Helena Bonham  Carter does a great job as Marla, the love interest whose vulgarity comes  off as an almost endearing quality.I have never really liked Hollywood  films much, finding them too defensive of the status quo.

A tad nihilistic and some holes are in the plot narration, the same fault in the book, but by its end you understand the main character's new view on life.

The movie is not actually advocating mindless violence or fascism.  Consumerism is not the movie's real target either; consumerism--in men--is a merely a symptom of what the movie is really criticizing. Nor is Fight Club ""macho porn,"" as Roger Ebert originally called it.Extremely relevant to the modern American culture, Fight Club is a dark comedy which acts as a cautionary tale about what happens to society when its men are emasculated, devalued, and robbed of any meaningful role as men.  It is no accident that the themes of castration, fatherlessness, and effeminacy keep popping up in the film--they are essential to the main idea.In short, the movie warns that when men and boys are stripped of their manliness and robbed of strong positive male role models, they will eventually rebel.  Since they don't know how to act as men in a positive way--channeling their masculinity in creative and constructive ways--they will resort to the crudest and most primative form of masculinity, brutal destructive violence.",5,A Great Cautionary Tale,1158105600,"09 13, 2006",2006,1129,"['how', 'many', 'people', 'totally', 'miss', 'point', 'Fight', 'Club', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'movie', 'not', 'actually', 'advocating', 'mindless', 'violence', 'fascism', 'Consumerism', 'not', 'movie', 'real', 'target', 'consumerism', 'men', 'merely', 'symptom', 'what', 'movie', 'really', 'criticizing', 'Fight', 'Club', 'macho', 'porn', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'originally', 'called', 'it.Extremely', 'relevant', 'modern', 'American', 'culture', 'Fight', 'Club', 'dark', 'comedy', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'what', 'society', 'when', 'men', 'are', 'emasculated', 'devalued', 'robbed', 'meaningful', 'role', 'men', 'accident', 'themes', 'castration', 'fatherlessness', 'effeminacy', 'keep', 'popping', 'up', 'film', 'are', 'essential', 'main', 'idea.In', 'short', 'movie', 'when', 'men', 'boys', 'are', 'stripped', 'manliness', 'robbed', 'strong', 'positive', 'male', 'role', 'models', 'will', 'eventually', 'rebel', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'act', 'men', 'positive', 'way', 'channeling', 'masculinity', 'creative', 'constructive', 'ways', 'will', 'resort', 'crudest', 'most', 'primative', 'form', 'masculinity', 'brutal', 'destructive', 'violence']",N/A

Jack can't sleep, ends up going to group help meetings, faking any type of condition to get a release, in the form of a good cry.  He meets another fraud in Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) and it ruins it for him.  They agree to split the meetings so they don't have to see each other.  Then, on the way back on a business flight, he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt).  Jack gets Tyler's business card and when Jack finds his apartment has been blown to pieces, he calls Tyler.  They end up meeting for drinks and then at Tyler's request having a fight.  They bond and Jack is invited to live with Tyler.Tyler lives in an abandoned house, a real dump.  Things start happening that affect Jack profoundly.  The fighting eventually builds into a cult following and becomes Fight Club.  The common line is ""we are a generation of men raised by women.""  Profound statements by Tyler seem to flow like a river. Jack has a meeting with the boss due to Jacks failing performance at work and the resulting scene is one of my favorites.  The Club turns into a rowdy group, causing chaos across the city. Fight Club grows and eventually moves to other cities.Tyler ends up with Marla after a plead for help during a suicide attempt, Jack hates her.  Tyler starts ""Project Mayhem"" without Jack's knowledge and the extremes that this action is leading to are more than Jack wants to deal with.  The ending is a big twist and begs one to see the movie again to see where the twist should have been a known during the movie.The fascinating cinematography, the rapid pace, the plot development and the unbelievable acting just cannot be fully appreciated in one viewing, making this one of my most watched DVDs.

(literally) out of each other, and those people who actually took the time to discover that the previous assumption is totally false.  A friend told me I absolutely HAD to see this movie, so I rented it.  Not paying attention to the first 20 minutes, imagine my surpise to suddenly be stricken completly confused by what I was hearing.  I immediately rewound it and began it again, giving it the attention it deserved.  After it was over, I rewound it again and watched it.  It was perhaps the 5th or 6th viewing that I finally took everything in.  Not to say that I didn't comprehend it; the plot is quite understandable.  But it is unbelievable how many subtle points indicate everything that is to come.  Similar to the opening of ""The Sixth Sense"": pay proper attention, and the solution is easily predictable.  However, ""Fight Club"" has not much to do with a group of men getting together and venting frustrations by bare-knuckle fighting (with draws connections to Brad Pitt's role in ""Snatch"").  The fighting is only incedential.  It serves simply as a method of finding people who meet certain characteristics to perform certain activities.  Almost everything about the movie makes you wince: from the fighting itself, to the camera work beautifully expressing the disgusting conditions surrounding the characters, to the final scene during which you sit there in amazement and total awe.  It's at the same time hard to believe and completely understandable.  There is no other way everything would have happened, and yet you sit there in a stupor because you are still upset at yourself for believing the same thing I did.

In fact, a friend of mine recently moved from Wisconsin told me that there was an attempt in his town to ban this movie because people were reinacting many of the characters' activities.

This is not a film, as the previews and original teaser suggested, about pure male testosterone being manifested in basement brawls. It is not a mindless-violence, action-hero flick used solely as a vehicle to show the washboard abs and chiseled man-waist of Brad Pitt. It is, actually, a film about the chaotic descent into madness and clarity by the main character. It is about the schism of personality that occurs not only with manic depressives or schizophrenics, but on a smaller scale with each and every one of us, every day, as we question our purpose, our reasons for fitting the mold when all we want to do is break free, and our intense and inward reactions to the immense pressures of culture and society.In this phenomenally directed film, we watch the main character, ""Jack,"" played by an intensely baggy-eyed Edward Norton, stagger through his Starbucks-saturated life as a claims investigator for a major automotive company. Upon returning from a business trip, two major turning points coincide in Jack's life-he meets the charismatic and unfettered soap salesman Tyler Durden, played by Pitt, and he returns to his condo to discover that his precisely coordinated IKEA-like furniture and accessories have been incinerated in an explosion. The first appearance of the ""fight club"" after which the movie is named occurs that same night, when Jack calls Tyler for some solace over a beer. As they leave the bar, Tyler challenges Jack with the words ""I want you to hit me as hard as you can."" Thus begins the strange world in which men beat each other up seemingly just for the pleasure of it.Tyler, with Jack always a few steps behind him, builds an underground network of fight clubs, where men come to test their strength and feel alive. This is not a film that exploits violence simply for the entertainment factor. It's a deeply funny, deeply thoughtful film about the roots of violence, and the possible need for violence amongst the displaced men of today's culture. Suckled on advertising and inhabiting the soft life of corporations, how can the past hunters of society not be driven to make violence-or at least something that feels powerful-with their hands? It taps into the rage men feel at being promised and denied a spot as a demi-god in the culture simply because of their gender, and also taps into the hopelessness the younger generation feels at having been raised without our fathers.Helena Bonham Carter is really the only woman in the film, but having a mostly male cast does not hurt this film for an intelligent female audience. So many of its components speak more directly to a generational frustration than any male-female dilemma, and the insights on the current male situation through this film are thought provoking regardless of gender.Rest assured, you'll be able to discuss and debate this movie with your friends for countless hours, and each time you view it, you'll find something new to contribute to the conversation.

Fight Club was good.The most important ingredient for me in awarding stars to a movie is that it was a realistic film. A believable film. You know, ""Could this happen in real life?"" That's the key for me.I'm not saying that the Fantasy Genre doesn't interest me. It does! Just look at my other reviews here. Look at some of the movies that I've given high marks to. The Descent (2005). Night of the Living Dead (1968 & 1990). Even 1997's Starship Troopers earns high marks. Why? Because the director pulls you in with adult situations where the players all act like adults; they do what you'd expect them to do when faced with their given situations. Or at they do something, while not expected, is not out of the realms of possibility.In Fight Club the acting is good...it even boarders on great. The story is fun. The twists and turns are unexpected and brilliantly executed. The development of the actual Fight Club?...Well...would you expect employees of every establishment and institution to become members? Next level: would every single member that joined to fight in underground Ultimate Fighting matches also seemingly become as interested in becoming terrorists? Of course not. So taketh away from my experience and ability to walk away with an above average experience.Fred Durst may have ""seen the Fight Club about 28 times,"" but I have and will see it just once. I was entertained. It was a good movie with fast moving action. But the reality factor took it back a notch.Fincher's resume is full of ""good"" movies.

But because I'm a huge fan of Edward Norton I went ahead and bought this film. It was nothing like I expected at all.To start off Edward Norton is an unnamed man who has insomnia, to fall asleep he goes to support groups where he meets a man named Bob (played wonderfully by Meat Loaf), going to these support groups helps him sleep and makes him feel better about his life. Everything is going well until a &quot;tourist&quot; to this groups comes in and shatters everything, this girl (played oddly by Helena Bonham Carter) and Edward Norton make a deal so they can share their support groups. All is going well untill Edward Norton meets a man named Tyler (played by Brad Pitt) a soapmaker, on a plane. After getting off of the plane Edward finds his bags gone and goes home to his apartment to find it blown up. The only person he has to turn to is Tyler, the man he met in the plane. After meeting up with Tyler, he stays at his Tyler's house and they start up a group that fights so they can get their tension out...hence... FIGHT CLUB!This movie is very freaky, very funny, very violence, very provocitive, and very good. This movie reminds me of a Stanley Kubrick film. Edward Norton of course, is great as always.

First of all, it has been completely mismarketed.  While the subplot of two men starting an underground movement where anger and aggression is released through physical conflict IS present in the movie, Fight Club is a much more intricate web of human emotion.  It does not glorify violence, as many may have assumed.  This is a very ugly movie, and yet, it is strangely beautiful.  Director David Fincher is known for making cheerless yet compelling movies, and this is his finest.To reveal too much about the plot is to spoil the fun, which is possibly why all of the trailers for this movie seem to be so misleading.  But in essence it is the story of Jack (to which he is indirectly referred, as his true name is never revealed) and Tyler, two unlikely strangers, who meet one day and realize they are tired of life.  That night, as both are leaving a bar, they drunkenly begin to fight each other because its something neither of them has ever done, and when it is over, they are intrigued by what they have done.  This fighting continues as Tyler and Jack find it is a way for both of them to release their anger and tension without guilt.  The weekly fighting sessions begin to attract more people, and this escalates to the point where the fighting actually begins to become an organized activity.  Of course, the fighting itself is chaotic, but all the members of the club are bound under rules that must be followed.  This continues for a while, but soon, Tyler becomes bored by it all, and uses his faithful followers to orchestrate more complex scenarios.  This eventually leads to an out of control Anarchist movement that extends far beyond the power of Jack, who has become powerless now that Tyler has assumed full control.  Throw in a suicidal girlfriend, Meat Loaf, a twist ending, a barrage of innovative visual directing techniques, and the Pixies, and you have yourself one killer movie, without a doubt the best film of 2001.And that's not even the HALF of it (pun intended for those who have seen this film).I would be lying if I said that Fight Club is likely to be enjoyed by all who see it.  And not to be sexist ladies, but I think Fight Club may be targeted more towards the guys (this is not to say the feminine populace will not like the movie, only that their is a higher level of testosterone present than there is estrogen).However, even if you see the movie and dislike it, the two-disk special edition version of ""Fight Club"" is possibly the best overall release to come from Fox EVER.  The widescreen anamorphic transfer is flawless, the 5.1 surround is exceptional, and the features are...extensive.  Begin with FOUR full length audio commentaries (I only listened to the last one so far, but it was highly entertaining), a seemingly endless supply of featurettes, a few deleted scenes, a barrage of great storyboards, and end with some cast and crew bios and trailers for good measure. On a more comedic note, there's also some hilarious publicity material, and an outtakes reel.  That's a pretty deluxe package, and I can't see any reason to not own this DVD.  Don't bother renting it, it you've read this far, your going to want to own it!This isn't just a movie, it's an experience.

Fight Club not only scoffs at our civilization,  but it forces us to envision a totalitarian society in which we live only  for self-destruction and elimination of order. Pure anarchy and  unadulterated rage. What could be more fun?Even though I'm a woman and  this film literally slanders the female counterpart, I was able to look  past that to see that the story does make a significant and amusing point  in all its glorified madness.&quot;The things you own end up owning  you&quot; is a pitiful but inevitable statement made by the prime minister  of chaos himself, Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). He explains in so many words  throughout the scattered scenes that we are but mindless consumers drowning  in the money-minded occupancy of our twisted souls, and that in truth we  are nothing more than living, breathing shells all bound by the same  animalistic natures. Soon after the foundation of Fight Club is created, a  nationwide following ensues and Tyler's steadfast minions devise a plan to  annihilate all major credit card companies and all records pertaining,  setting the world's infinite circle of debt back to zero.Following two  steps behind is a soft-spoken victim of society, nameless and  impressionable. He appears to be Tyler's right-hand man and develops his  killer instinct for rebellion and rage. You soon learn that this  &quot;Jack&quot; is the one behind it all, Tyler Durden the resulting  fabrication of his sudden and inexplicable epiphany.The camera work is  creative, flashy and strewn all over the place, the story moving with the  emotional adrenalin of its characters. This could be classified as an  action flick, but it doesn't contain even half the eye-candy car  crash/fire/explosion exhibitions that normal action movies are saturated  in. Fight Club packs the punch with its corrupt ideals and frenzied  motivation, making it a unique classification for the action genre.None  other than David Fincher could have done the movie justice with its dark,  surrealistic mood and spectacular performances from its leading men. He  seems to get the best out of Brad Pitt, whom I, for quite some time,  considered a very mediocre actor and at best just another pretty face.  Edward Norton barely needs guidance here, the perfect picture of the  unassuming and compliant citizen turned masochistic and vengeful mutineer.  As for Helena Bonham Carter, she's an endearing attachment, but more than  anything she's a fifth wheel. The movie could've been done without her and  not much would've changed except for the exaggerated sex scenes, which were  mostly added for humor anyway.If you're looking for a movie that has an  acerbic approach and a wild streak like you've never seen, a movie that  makes you question the way you live and how you think, then head in the  direction of Chuck Palaniuhk's convulted tale.

519136,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B00003CWQ2,Steven Aldersley,"[1, 2]","Fight Club (1999)Drama, 139 minutesDirected by David FincherStarring Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham CarterWhy do I like Fight Club? It seems to suggest that violence and anarchy are good things, but that's certainly not something I believe. I think it comes down to the dark comedy and the strong script, coupled with excellent performances from Norton and Pitt. This is a cool world to experience, but I wouldn't want to live in it.The story seems perfectly traditional at first. We see Norton on a plane. He's referred to as The Narrator in the credits and seems to think of himself as Jack. He encounters Tyler Durden (Pitt) and takes his business card. Jack returns home to find that there's been an explosion in his apartment, so he calls Durden and eventually asks to stay at his house for a while. Durden is a cheerful, carefree lunatic who wants Jack to punch him. The two fight on the street and decide to recruit members and form Fight Club, believing that it's an expression of freedom.Jack spends his free time visiting support groups. We see him hugging people with testicular cancer and all manner of diseases. He enjoys letting his inhibitions go and listening to the members speak about their illnesses. After a while, he becomes aware of Marla (Helena Bonham Carter). Like him, she's a tourist visiting the various support groups. He confronts her and they agree to attend different classes.Durden encourages Jack to stop trying to live up to the expectations of other people. As a result, Jack becomes more assertive. He challenges the authority of his boss and stops worrying about his appearance and the latest IKEA catalog. He regularly shows up for work with fresh cuts and bruises. Jack finds that he enjoys his new image. One thing he doesn't like is Durden forming a relationship with Marla.Fight Club is set in a gritty world and makes the viewer feel unclean while watching it. Fincher is good at creating unsettling worlds and this one is similar to those found in The Game and Se7en. Durden's house appears derelict and the neighborhood is seedy. As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that Durden has a purpose for starting Fight Club. The recruits are assigned tasks to disrupt society and members can come from any occupational background. It's like a secret society.Fight Club contains a major twist and I won't reveal it for those who haven't ever seen the movie. The twist elevates the movie to a different level. Subsequent viewings are enhanced because you'll notice little details you may have missed the first time. It's clever how everything ties together. The ending annoys some viewers, but it works perfectly for me. The final sequence is set to one of my favorite Pixies' songs and is probably my favorite scene in the entire movie.Although it's not an action movie, Fight Club is a pure adrenaline rush. From the opening credits set to the pounding beat of the Dust Brothers, it rarely lets up until the relative calm of the closing scene.I'm enjoying this project and got more out of Fight Club on yesterday's viewing than I ever have before. Just don't go out and copy the behavior it depicts.",5,"Sorry, but I have to break rule No. 1",1330473600,"02 29, 2012",2012,3152,"['Fight', 'Club', '1999', 'Drama', '139', 'minutesDirected', 'David', 'FincherStarring', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'CarterWhy', 'do', 'like', 'Fight', 'Club', 'suggest', 'violence', 'anarchy', 'are', 'good', 'things', 'certainly', 'not', 'something', 'believe', 'think', 'down', 'dark', 'comedy', 'strong', 'script', 'coupled', 'excellent', 'performances', 'Norton', 'Pitt', 'cool', 'world', 'experience', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'live', 'it.The', 'story', 'perfectly', 'traditional', 'first', 'see', 'Norton', 'plane', 'referred', 'Narrator', 'credits', 'think', 'Jack', 'Tyler', 'Durden', 'Pitt', 'business', 'card', 'Jack', 'home', 'find', 'been', 'explosion', 'apartment', 'Durden', 'eventually', 'stay', 'house', 'while', 'Durden', 'cheerful', 'carefree', 'lunatic', 'who', 'Jack', 'punch', 'two', 'fight', 'street', 'decide', 'recruit', 'members', 'form', 'Fight', 'Club', 'believing', 'expression', 'freedom.Jack', 'free', 'time', 'visiting', 'support', 'groups', 'see', 'hugging', 'people', 'testicular', 'cancer', 'manner', 'diseases', 'letting', 'inhibitions', 'go', 'listening', 'members', 'speak', 'illnesses', 'while', 'aware', 'Marla', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'tourist', 'visiting', 'various', 'support', 'groups', 'agree', 'attend', 'different', 'classes.Durden', 'Jack', 'stop', 'trying', 'live', 'up', 'expectations', 'other', 'people', 'result', 'Jack', 'more', 'assertive', 'authority', 'boss', 'worrying', 'appearance', 'latest', 'IKEA', 'catalog', 'regularly', 'up', 'work', 'fresh', 'cuts', 'bruises', 'Jack', 'new', 'image', 'One', 'thing', ""n't"", 'like', 'Durden', 'forming', 'relationship', 'Marla.Fight', 'Club', 'set', 'gritty', 'world', 'viewer', 'feel', 'unclean', 'watching', 'Fincher', 'good', 'creating', 'unsettling', 'worlds', 'one', 'similar', 'found', 'Game', 'Se7en', 'Durden', 'house', 'derelict', 'neighborhood', 'seedy', 'story', 'unfolds', 'clear', 'Durden', 'purpose', 'starting', 'Fight', 'Club', 'recruits', 'are', 'assigned', 'tasks', 'disrupt', 'society', 'members', 'can', 'come', 'occupational', 'background', 'secret', 'society.Fight', 'Club', 'major', 'twist', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'twist', 'movie', 'different', 'level', 'Subsequent', 'viewings', 'are', 'enhanced', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'little', 'details', 'may', 'have', 'missed', 'first', 'time', 'clever', 'how', 'everything', 'together', 'ending', 'viewers', 'perfectly', 'final', 'sequence', 'set', 'one', 'favorite', 'Pixies', 'songs', 'probably', 'favorite', 'scene', 'entire', 'not', 'action', 'movie', 'Fight', 'Club', 'pure', 'adrenaline', 'rush', 'opening', 'credits', 'set', 'pounding', 'beat', 'Dust', 'Brothers', 'rarely', 'up', 'relative', 'calm', 'closing', 'scene.I', ""'m"", 'enjoying', 'project', 'got', 'more', 'Fight', 'Club', 'yesterday', 'viewing', 'ever', 'have', 'before', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'out', 'copy', 'behavior']",N/A

The sad thing is, the poor sap labelled spokesmodel for my generation killed himself...so what does that say about us? And as if that blow doesn't still sting, we have a movie like FIGHT CLUB...a movie that I admire (even though it pisses me off) because, like Tyler Durden, it speaks the truth. &quot;We are the middle children of history...no purpose.&quot; I am not sure if that is exactly how the quote goes, but you get the point...&quot;We have no great war, no great depression. Our war is a spiritual war, our great depression is our lives.&quot; How true. I have wandered throughout my teenage years feeling I had no purpose, nothing to struggle for. I thought it was just adolescence, but I still feel that way at 24. What are we doing in this life? Okay, the stock market crashes every few years. Murder and other violent crimes are on the rise. The federal government has pretty much waved the white flag on the war against drugs...but do I care? Not when I am bombarded by DVD ads, Playstation 2, weight loss programs, ab machines...superficial things. America's soul has died but we are trying to save our bodies (to paraphrase George Carlin), and it just doesn't work that way (the &quot;spiritual war&quot; of which Tyler speaks). And with the increase in multiple technologies we have everything at our fingertips these days...nothing to struggle for. I believe many of the violent crimes out there are indeed happening for the same reason Fight Club was created: there is no battle in our lives, and we actually have to go out of our way to CAUSE ourselves struggle. Violence for the sake of feeling like life has a challenge. Raised with the wool over our eyes by a society that would have us believe owning a yin yang coffee table makes you one step closer to perfection...and how are we to handle the truth once we finally find it?

They complain about the amazing amount of graphic violence, the plot's twists, and the film's lack of intelligence.These people need to take a deep breath, count to three, and watch the movie over again.  If they still can find nothing to like, they need to have their head checked.""Fight Club"" is one of the best films I've ever seen.  Beyond it being one of the finest novel-to-screen adaptations ever, it is simply an astounding film.  Everything about it is designed to shock the viewer out of complacency: the subliminals, the fantasy cutaways, even the brutal violence are really just punctuation marks, underscoring the movie's actual statements.  Beneath the action movie facade, ""Fight Club"" is really an intellectual film.""Fight Club"" is about the modern American male, and the state of permanent angst and adolescence they've been forced into by a society which raises them without fathers, force-feeding them dead-end jobs, consumerist garbage and idiotic ""everyone-is-special-in-their-own-way"" psychology.  What's interesting is that the film not only provides a counter-argument, but an argument against its own argument.  It suggests a parallel extreme, wherein we would be forced back into another Dark Age, would be wrong as well.The narrator in ""Fight Club"", who is nameless throughout the film, seeks to escape from the urban nightmare his life has become, as it causes him terrible insomnia.  First, he tries attending support groups for people with lethal illnesses, despite his lack of any.  This helps him to confront death and despair in a tangible way, and appreciate the fact that he's alive, curing his insomnia.  That is, until he meets Marla Singer, a fellow faker who makes him unable to find the release he so desperately needs.  Marla and the Narrator manage to come to an agreement about who can attend which group, but the damage has been done.A little later, the Narrator meets Tyler Durden, a man who is the polar opposite of him.  Tyler lives on the edge, making soap, being a waiter at fancy buffets (where he does various obscene things to the food), and changing reels at the movie theater (where he splices frames of dirty movies into kiddie pics).  Something about Tyler is magnetic to the Narrator, and through a series of events the two come to live together, and create the eponymous Fight Clubs.To tell anymore would spoil the movie's many delights; it's subversive, funny, thought-provoking, thrilling and consistantly entertaining.  Fincher's direction takes major risks and constantly manages to succeed, and the thought that's been put into every frame is evident.  The cinematography is excellent, the Dust Brothers music hip and appropriate, the writing stylized and snappy, capturing the novel's tone without being overly derivative.  ""Fight Club"" is a masterpiece, the best Hollywood film in a very long time.

David Fincher makes dark films that toss muddled characters together and Fate spins the wheel. Centrifugal force takes over. Don't get me wrong. The plot holds to logical conventions, reality may be stretched, but the otherworldiness of 'Seven', for example, [filmed] in a dreary, nameless city, doesn't overly tax credibility. In ""Fight Club"" the idea that Tyler and 'Jack' could spearhead a global movement of disaffected men with a penchant for thumping each other into senselessness, while a bit silly, isn't impossible to believe, given how men engage in the sorting out of the pecking order normally. Anyone who has watched 4 year old boys in a sandbox knows that aggression determines who keeps the shovel.But the movie is not about the Social Learning Theory of aggressive behavior. It's about how we arrive at what is worth fighting for, about emotional connectedness, about how we integrate conflicting agenda items into our consciousness. You can say all you want about the likeability of the characters. Personally, I wouldn't trust Marla or Jack or Tyler for a minute, but each character is playing out a role that typifies a point on everyones psychological map. Jack is in Siberia, in a consumerist gulag that has him prisoner to the Ikea catalog. Marla, though plenty attractive, is so damaged by life that she wanders from one self-help meeting to another ( as does Jack ), hoping to heal her invisible psychic wounds. Tyler is a glib, self-made philosopher/soap salesman whose motives seem to be mostly iconoclastic. The perfect trio.What happens in this film occurs because each character is impelled to pursue a fated role, not because he or she wants the inevitable outcome, but because each choice narrows the succeeding choices. In such a nihilist universe, love is destructive, not redeeming. I don't think this movie is enjoyable in conventional terms; it is abrupt, dangerous, eccentric as well as ironic and a little creepy.

Now, it's my turn.To be blunt, I thought that everything about ""Fight Club"" was predictable.  However, a film with a cult following this big has to be taken seriously.On the surface, ""Fight Club"" is about what happens to the male psyche when things break down.  That's the synopsis, which gradually proceeds to a plot twist about  of the way into the film.On another level, ""Fight Club"" is only going to appeal to males who are attempting to establish an identity for themselves.  That's the underlying theme. Not that many guys over the age of thirty are going to be able to relate to this stuff.  This film is strictly for the ""X box"" generation.It used to be worth it to want acceptance from your peers.  Now, it's seen as a sign of weakness. At the beginning of ""Fight Club"", the Edward Norton character hangs out in 12 Step groups and cancer survivor groups in an attempt to be noticed.  (Dude! I can relate!) Eventually, the Edward Norton character gravitates towards self-actualization, culminating in ultrareality, or proximity thereof.At almost two and a half hours, ""Fight Club"" was way too long.  It should have been abbreviated to about an hour and a half. Also, it would actually have made more sense to truncate and manipulate the sequence of scenes (i.e., show the ending near the middle of the film, the beginning at the end, etc.), much like ""Pulp Fiction"".I was also disappointed in the story's deadpan ending and was half expecting a more bizarre twist:  Either Chuck Norris or Gina Gershon appearing in an onscreen cameo to announce, ""It blowed up real good.""John Hinkley thought that by killing Ronald Reagan, he would eventually be able to fall in love and achieve orgasm with Jodi Foster.  At one time, I never would have been able to believe that ""Taxi Driver"" would inspired anyone to blow their nose.  Or that ""The Basketball Diaries"" would be the inspiration for a massacre in Colorado.  Hey, it's supposed to be entertainment, right?I don't know about ""Fight Club"" the novel, but I would imagine that probably a half-dozen (at least) new John Hinkleys and Timothy McVeighs are - right now, as you read this - being inspired by this film.  Which is ironic because it would appear to me that the only inspiration anyone had in the conception of ""Fight Club"" (the novel and film) was to get a decent paycheck by pandering to the readership of ""MAXIM"" magazine.In 1999, when this film was released, the white, male, under 25 target audience for this film understood that ""Fight Club"" was a guy film from beginning to end, not a dinner and a date movie. It was sort of a male religious experience.  At that point in time, the war in Iraq and 9/11 was still a glint in someone's eye.  Then, after 9/11, this film became less relevant.Groucho Marx once said, ""I'll never watch a film where the man's t*ts are bigger that the woman's.""

I will say this: I didn't like this movie at first because I didn't know it was supposed to be satire, and I didn't know what to look for; watching it on DVD changed my mind.  There.DON'T THROW OUT YOUR 2-DISC DVD JUST YET.  Except for HOT FUZZ and SERENITY, I've never seen a perfect DVD-Blu-ray conversion, and this is why FIGHT CLUB only gets 4 stars instead of 5.  Most of the important production materials from the 2-Disc Special Edition are here (titles, location footage, deleted scenes, etc.) but some of the footage from the DVD didn't make it (like the BTS fight choreography training); the fact that this has been replaced by a perfunctory Spike TV awards show clip (probably chosen because it was in HD) isn't much consolation.  There's also no retrospective documentary, which a film like this probably deserves.The special features menus is a little hard to navigate because there's no color highlighting on the titles, but once you get the hang of it, you'll be okay.  Probably the most irritating thing is the chapter selection only offers one chapter at a time instead of a full screen of choices.The film transfer itself is pretty sweet: the grain from the film stock is visible (very nice), but it tends to clash slightly with the compression leaving the grain looking a little bit ""sparky"" but not enough to be distracting (I noticed because I was deliberately scrutinizing the image, not casually watching it).  There does seem to be some inconsistency in the blacks from shot to shot, and you can also see some pixellation in said blacks at certain times.  Again, keep in mind I was LOOKING for this stuff, it didn't just jump out at me; although you might notice it a little more if your TV is about 46"" or more.But all this only takes 1 star off the review; nothing omitted was terribly important and the transfer is pretty great.  The movie itself looks as new as the day it was made and it thankfully hasn't been altered from its original aspect ratio for 16:9 TVs.  I think the $15.99 price tag on it currently makes up for any flaws.",3,Excellent Blu-Ray....Buuuuuuuuuuuuuut...,1258502400,"11 18, 2009",2009,2286,"['Instead', 'trying', 'inflate', 'self-importance', 'pretending', 'be', 'amateur', 'movie', 'critic', 'arguing', 'good/bad', 'aspects', 'FIGHT', 'CLUB', ""'m"", 'going', 'review', 'actual', 'BLU-RAY', 'DISC', 'people', 'who', 'may', 'want', 'buy', 'will', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'first', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'satire', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'look', 'watching', 'DVD', 'changed', 'mind', 'There.DO', ""N'T"", 'THROW', 'OUT', 'YOUR', '2-DISC', 'DVD', 'JUST', 'YET', 'HOT', 'FUZZ', 'SERENITY', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'perfect', 'DVD-Blu-ray', 'conversion', 'why', 'FIGHT', 'CLUB', 'only', '4', 'stars', 'instead', '5', 'Most', 'important', 'production', 'materials', '2-Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', 'are', 'here', 'titles', 'location', 'footage', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'etc', 'footage', 'DVD', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'BTS', 'fight', 'choreography', 'training', 'fact', 'been', 'replaced', 'perfunctory', 'Spike', 'TV', 'awards', 'show', 'clip', 'probably', 'chosen', 'was', 'HD', ""n't"", 'much', 'consolation', 'also', 'retrospective', 'documentary', 'film', 'probably', 'special', 'features', 'menus', 'little', 'hard', 'navigate', 'color', 'highlighting', 'titles', 'once', 'get', 'hang', ""'ll"", 'be', 'okay', 'Probably', 'most', 'irritating', 'thing', 'chapter', 'selection', 'only', 'one', 'chapter', 'time', 'instead', 'full', 'screen', 'choices.The', 'film', 'transfer', 'pretty', 'sweet', 'grain', 'film', 'stock', 'visible', 'very', 'nice', 'clash', 'slightly', 'compression', 'leaving', 'grain', 'looking', 'little', 'bit', 'sparky', 'not', 'enough', 'be', 'distracting', 'noticed', 'was', 'deliberately', 'scrutinizing', 'image', 'not', 'casually', 'watching', 'seem', 'be', 'inconsistency', 'blacks', 'shot', 'shot', 'can', 'also', 'see', 'pixellation', 'said', 'blacks', 'certain', 'times', 'Again', 'keep', 'mind', 'was', 'LOOKING', 'stuff', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'jump', 'out', 'might', 'notice', 'little', 'more', 'TV', '46', 'more.But', 'only', '1', 'star', 'review', 'nothing', 'omitted', 'was', 'terribly', 'important', 'transfer', 'pretty', 'great', 'movie', 'as', 'new', 'day', 'was', 'made', 'thankfully', ""n't"", 'been', 'altered', 'original', 'aspect', 'ratio', '16:9', 'TVs', 'think', '15.99', 'price', 'tag', 'currently', 'up', 'flaws']",N/A

519162,ANYAO2HIXD43D,B00003CWQ2,Theodore C Nicholas,"[2, 10]","Fight Club, directed by David Fincher (Seven, The Game), is a visually stunning film with an incredible beginning and a wonderful cast. Too bad the film went downhill. Based on an insanse book by a writer who never believed in paragraphs, the movie is filled with darkness, chaos, and mayhem. Edward Norton plays an unidentified narrator, who has an equally anonymous life. It's so anonymous that even he doesn't know what his life consists of. He meets a manic-depressive named Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), the greatest character of the film, who graces the screen in dollar dresses that were once worn at funerals and weddings. Then, our hero meets Tyler Durden, and the film makes a huge mistake. Tyler encompasses everything that one should not aspire to be. He's a terrorist/philosopher/maniac/megalomaniac who preaches to the X-generation, making soap and bombs and telling everyone that they are worthless and meaningless. Fincher shouldn't have taken this route, it's teenaged, unbelievable, and uninteresting. And it's a shame too. The beginning so is amazing, that if Tyler Durden were not in the film, this could have been an incredible film.Anyway, Durden, played by Brad Pitt, convinces insecure men that they can find a zen like state by beating each other up.

Add to that the movie's grab-bag anti-establishment philosophy of Buddhist non-attachment and anarchist smash the system direct action, fuel it all with rage, and you have a truly heady mix, particularly for the young who are experiencing their first exposure to these ideas.The problem that I have with Fight Club is that it is the poster child of sophomoric movies. It combines valuable philosophical insights about our consumer society and its ills with outrageous foolishness about both the extent of those ills and the solutions to them. Though it sets up a conflict between Ed Norton's nameless protagonist and his alter ego and nemesis Tyler (played in his trademark over the top style by Brad Pitt) even in its ultimate resolution it still comes down to simplistic, foolish wish fulfillment. It is completely normal to find this profound at twenty, but if at forty you still find it profound, you should seriously question your maturity level.The other great sin of this movie is its ridiculous plot twist. It is the worst example of a violation of internal logic in any movie that I have watched in recent memory. This cheap, ill-conceived twist hurts the credibility of what is otherwise a bold and daring cinematic creation. Even given the movie's sophomoric philosophy, I would have still given it four stars had this silly twist not totally ruined the movie's credibility for me.Cinematically, Fight Club is bold, flashy, and innovative. Ed Norton, Helena Bonham Carter, and even Meat Loaf contribute performances worth watching. If you don't mind brutal, testosterone soaked screeds, I would recommend that you rent it.

It would be easy to say this, but it it would not be true. Fight Club is whatever you want it to be.  Meet Edward Norton. We are not told his character's name in this movie. The reason for this might be that he is a representative of all the men like him. He is stuck in a job he hates, and goes to 12- step meetings in order to make himself feel better. Whenever he is seated on a plane, he has sadistic images in his head of the plane going down, and he hopes that it will, but it doesn't. It is on a plane that he meets Tyler Durden(Brad Pitt), who tells him that the only use of the oxygen masks are to give the passengers a high so that they will accept their fate. He seems to see right through Norton in a way that is very strange. The only thing that we find out about Durden is that he likes to play pranks such as changing the chemical content of a customer's soup(You get what I mean) and snipping a frame of adult film into a children's movie. Norton stays with Durden in a run down house because his apartment blew up and then Marla(Helena Bonham Carter) comes into the picture. She is an angry chain smoker who seems to dislike all of the men that she's with. Norton recognizes her from one of his self help groups.  One night Durden wants to fight with Norton just to get him to loosen up and so they fight. They continue to fight every night or so for a while and then they get noticed. More people want to join them and eventually they have a large following. They then fight in a basement under a bar and the group gets more organized. Durden then thinks up homework assignments so to speak for the members to complete. The homework assignments consist of vandalization and getting into a fight with someone. This is all in their benefit because it will set them free from their sad lives. The Fight Club seems to change from a group which causes small time mahem to a blown out terrorist organization. &quot;Fight Club&quot; is a dark film with the violence that is evident in many of David Fincher films such as &quot;Se7en&quot; and &quot;The Game&quot;. The screenplay was written by Jim Uhls which was based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk. This is definitely not a movie for everyone. Some people may walk out of this one feeling like they have to vomit while some may feel different in a way that cannot be explained.

But, a basic rundown of the film is this:A man (who remains unnamed through the film, and played by Edward Norton) is an insomniac. In order to deal with this issue, he attends support groups for people with diseases/problems in order to make himself feel better and sleep at night. He meets up with Tyler Durden (played by Brad Pitt) and eventually ends up staying with him due to the circumstances of the loss of his own apartment. Together, they make their own 'help group' called Fight Club. While it helps this group of men feel better and take back their lives, it eventually gets out of control and becomes something that Tyler calls ""Project Mayhem"". Edward Norton's character feels the need to stop Tyler once one of the members of the group is killed. And... then there's the surprise ending that you don't expect at all.This synopsis makes a very outstanding movie sound extremely dull, and I apologize for it. I just didn't want to spoil anything if you happen to have been in a cave for the last 10 years. Anyway, onto the BLU-RAY!The menus on the Blu-Ray are great.

519172,A3I2GBE2KGQV1U,B00003CWQ2,"Timothy Linsley ""Tim Linsley""","[2, 3]","It is far too easy for the general populace to misunderstand this movie, I guess.  So many people seem to be missing the point - indeed, *any* point - that this movie could be making, instead complaining about the violence and nihilism.  Could it be that the message actually *did* hit home, but most people were so let down - or ticked off - by it, that they decided it wasn't there?This movie is the flipside of &quot;American Beauty,&quot; another great film in which anarchy is used as an escape from the drudgery of life.  &quot;Beauty,&quot; though, was praised and celebrated, while &quot;Fight Club&quot; shunned.  Why?  The answer may be quite simple:  &quot;Beauty&quot; actually encouraged such behavior, appealing to the modern mantra &quot;if it feels good, do it.&quot;  Consequences were ignored, leaving one feeling that this was the right thing to do.  &quot;Fight Club,&quot; on the other hand, took that mantra to it's natural, disturbing end.  As Edward Norton yells late in the movie &quot;You morons!  You're running around in ski masks, blowing stuff up!  What did you expect?&quot;  While &quot;Beauty&quot; was a call to freedom, &quot;Fight Club&quot; was a call to moderation.  People are afraid to deal with consequences, though, therefore they focus on everything else.As for the violence, this is no worse than any boxing movie I've ever seen, with the exception of two gun-related wounds and one severe beating.  And from &quot;Raging Bull&quot; to &quot;Rocky,&quot; not a complaint has arisen.  Why now?  Because there's a message involved.  What I don't understand is how a film like Kubrick's &quot;A Clockwork Orange,&quot; is considered a challenging, thought-provoking classic, when it's even *more* disturbing and over the top.  At least &quot;Fight Club&quot; doesn't feature any giant genetalia.Everything involved in this movie is top notch, from Edward Norton's bored, cynical narration to David Fincher's visually stunning direction.  Indeed, this film has such a bizzarre energy, warping in and out of speed and giving new meaning to the phrase &quot;extreme close-up.&quot;  There's enough here to please most people looking for something new in film.The most wonderful thing about this movie is the witty, literate screenplay by Jim Uhls, based on the equally stunning novel by the Vonnegut-like Chuck Pahlnuiuhk.  Mixing humor, action, and subtle (and not-so-subtle) philosophy, this just might be the most quotable movie of the year.Now, for the DVD.  When a movie is the reason you buy a DVD player, that says something.  When said movie is actually *worth* the DVD player, that says even more.  Wonderful for fans, this movie gives some wonderful behind the scenes material and stories.  Especially fun is the alternate audio track with Fincher, Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter (though her track was recorded seperately).  It's obvious the bond Fincher, Norton, and Pitt made during the shooting, given the relaxed atmosphere of this audio.  More than once a story is told about a botched take, and like kids in a candy shop, Norton and Pitt beg Fincher to put it on the DVD.  Jokes fly, complaints about the negative reviews, thoughts on the movies themes, and this is never dull to listen to.

519173,A1LZVU5SRRM3VX,B00003CWQ2,Timothy Michael Resh,"[10, 12]","Viewed under the right conditions by the right person, this movie is an absolute treat.  Viewed by the wrong person or by someone not in the right frame of mind, the movie's darkly comedic undertones can easily be missed amidst the brutal violence and coarse language.  That said, I viewed this movie under optimal conditions and with an open mind.  As a result, I stumbled upon one of my favorite films of all-time.Brad Pitt and Edward Norton really strut their comedic stuff in this movie, as both are brilliant in their roles.  Helena Bonham Carter and Meatloaf also manage to steal scenes throughout this perfectly cast film.  The entire cast walks the comedic line brilliantly without ever becoming campy, a feat for which David Fincher can take a significant amount of the credit.In Fight Club, Fincher truly shows his directorial genius in distilling Chuck Palahniuk's great but somewhat disjointed novel into a compelling, hilarious, and coherent storyline.  Although Fincher's version neglects some of Palahniuk's fundamental vision (the ultimate futility of nihilism, in particular), he captures the overall spirit of the noval and makes the story linear enough that movie audiences can follow the character from IKEA-loving corporate drone to anarchistic mastermind.  With the blackest of humor, Fincher decries everything that is wrong with modern society, from corporate America's cornflower-blue ties and action items to the emasculation and isolation of the American male to the evils of consumerism.  All important messages for people in the oft targeted 18-49 demographic.I have viewed the film with a number of other people, and my observation has been that people under 40 tend to view the film as brilliant and visionary, while people over 40 tend to take it too literally.  That is why I titled this review: the first rule of fight club is, don't take Fight Club too seriously.  Revel in the main character's insomnia and schizophrenia, and try to get Palahniuk &amp; Fincher's serious messages at the same time, understanding that those messages are conveyed through extreme hyperbole.Finally, if you have the opportunity, be sure to listen to the Fincher commentary on the film, as it is probably one of the most insightful commentary tracks on any DVD currently on the market.  Fincher gives tremendous insight into the details of making this film that are interesting and pertinent enough to captivate anyone, from the most serious film student to the most casual viewer of films.

519174,AJYGQV81FSFE2,B00003CWQ2,Timothy P. Scanlon,"[2, 4]","I didn't know what to expect with this. Pitt's one of Hollywood's golden boys and Edward Norton has always impressed me.About the first two thirds of the film had me laughing. It was a brilliant satire, of self-help mania, of meaningless materialism, maybe even of violence. The characters are bizarre,for example one guy with a formidable set of breasts brought on by hormone injections to make up for his testicular cancer (He was a member of one of the 12-step groups), and Norton himself leads a pretty meaningless life, a leading point of the film.The story takes a turn when Norton, who reflects that he doesn't really belong in the 12-step groups he's attending, runs into a young woman who uses the meetings in the same way, i.e., something to do. Their fun began with her convoluted interaction with Norton and took off after Norton moved in with Brad Pitt's character; she and Pitt shook the whole neighborhood with their earthquake sex.To that point it made me laugh several times.The fight club itself began with a challenge of Pitt to Norton. It developoed as a caricature of consermerism, sort of fraternity. It was super-violent,clandestine, etc. I needn't repeat what countless other reviewers--most of whom have love  it--said.Up to this point, one of the funniest, and most worthwhile portions of the film was to see Edward Norton beat himself up! It was hysterical, and got him out of his work with benefits, a little like Kevin Spacey's character getting out of his job in &quot;American Beauty.&quot;After it was about 2/3 over, however, the film took a turn to I don't know where. It seems to want to become a psycho-drama. People see Norton and say that he's Pitt. Is he one person who's created the identity that he wishes he were? After the scene in which Norton blew his brains out to eliminate that alter ego--and lived!--it ends.I wouldn't discourage people from seeing this, if for no other reason, the first over half of the film made me laugh.

I missed the beginning of the film and I came to realize after viewing the movie for a second time, Fight Club is a pretty neat movie. I think I was anticipating more &quot;Fight Club&quot; fight scenes rather than a very involved plot that really leaves you amazed at the end.What makes Fight Club a decent movie is the fact that whether you know it or not, you are partially clueless as to what is really going on throughout the movie. Masking this cluelessness was done very well and explained properly in the end. The two main characters were first rate and I really came to appreciate Brad Pitt for more than just a pretty boy after seeing this as well as 7. The whole cast was exellent and between the different action scenes, dialogue sequences and crazy stunts, there was more than enough going on to keep your attention even while clueless. The climax, conclusion and summary of everything leaves you feeling mildly shocked, enlightened and even a bit confused though you think you understand finally; one of your first reactions is &quot;I should watch that again&quot;.Fight Club is an atypical movie that gets the brain to function more than the average flick.

519184,A39UKBJJXJ82FO,B00003CWQ2,Tristan,"[1, 2]","Based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk, Fight Club explores the darker side of mental instability in the form of a dark comedy. The film tells the rather unsettling story of an insomnia stricken man, played by Edward Norton. His life changed one day when he meets a mysterious soap maker named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) and, after his apartment room is blown up along with all of his belongings and the little that remains of his personal life, they became inspired to co-create a seedy underground club in which men are invited to attend and to pummel on each other to their heart's content as a form of physical therapy as well as an advanced form of personal male-bonding. Things get complex when a female drifter named Marla (Helena Bonham Carter) who inadvertently gets involved in the mentally deteriorated world that these two men share. Things only get worse when Tyler decides to take the club out onto the streets and then into their homes and into the lives of more political and respected people.As technically talented as Fincher is, what I admire most about the film is how he doesn't let the visuals tell the story. I know that a lot of moviegoers hate narration, but trust me when I say that it is put to good use here. The sarcastic, bitter, angry voice of Edward Norton that plays over the events helps a lot in driving the atmosphere of the film into it's audience, but it also adds to the humor of the film. Is the film a satire? I'd go onto say that it is as much a satire as South Park is. So then why the slick visuals? Why the sly, cool tone? Why the clever dialogue? Well, to me it all seemed very forced and over-the-top. Nobody in the real world talks like these characters, and it seems pretty obvious that the film knows this. You can tell in the sarcastic narration. I think that people may likely forget that it is Edward Norton's character who is doing the narration and so therefor we're watching the story unfold from the perspective of someone who is obviously crazy. Every person in this film is crazy in one way or another. Much like Terry Gilliam's Brazil, Fight Club shows a world devoid of any sort of normal thoughts of any kind, whether independent or not. What makes the film so bizarre is the fact the thoughts of the main character make sense in the sense that they have rationale to them. However, this is also how the film's humor comes through. The physical appearance of the main character slowly grows worse and worse while the characters around his grow more self-aware, more open-minded, and more like he was at one time. What makes this so funny is the fact that acts and methods these characters use to make themselves happier are so completely irrational and ridiculous that only a fool could ever take it seriously. Not to ruin the plot, but when it comes to illegal acts of vandalism involving public property being destroyed, there comes a point where politics don't seem so important in retrospect since we live in such an interesting and advanced time in the world today.Looking at this film ten years later, it still has just as much power as it did in 1999 or 2000 or whenever it was when people decided to start watching it. As I said before, David Fincher is a technical talent. His films often hold an incredible amount of visual energy, and Fight Club is no different. The performances are excellent. Edward Norton's performance here is one of his best, as is Helena Bonham Carter. As for Brad Pitt, he does exactly what the role requires from him and kudos to his for being such a good sport for being in this film. I definitely wouldn't call this his best performance. He is required to act in a sub-conscious way that feels full of self-deprecation, and this shouldn't be all that hard for any good actor as long as they are a good sport and they aren't afraid of looking stupid. I prefer his roles in films like 12 Monkeys in which he plays much more deeply troubling and complicated characters. The music in this film works equally as well. It's very dirty, industrial, and overbearing, much like the film itself. However, it is, at times, heavy to the point of absurdity, so it also helps with the humor of the film too. The film just has a tremendous spirit, though I can't say that I actually enjoy watching it. It's full of blood and guts from beginning to end, though it doesn't exactly have a high bodycount. It's often very ugly to look at, which I don't mind except when it gets to the point where it makes the film feel a little too dirty in that way that makes you want to shower. This is also a very very homoerotic film, not just in the fight scenes but also in the way the male characters act around and toward each other. Their mannerisms, as well as their quick little quirks and playful flirtations, get pretty weird after a while. It's about as homoerotic a film as Interview With the Vampire. I can't say that I'm anywhere near as infatuated with it as I was when I was in high school, where any film that tried new things seemed revolutionary and brilliant, and just as well, this film makes it very difficult to take Brad Pitt seriously in most of his other films. None of these things where what I originally loved about this film, however, and the film itself still works great as a comedy. The fight scenes in this film are also excellently choreographed and the gore effects in these scenes are wonderfully done. The final shot of the film may, at once, be considered by some to be an amazing and rebellious shot, but I laugh just thinking about it due to another very brief image in one frame of the shot that occurs just as the credits are appearing.So overall, Fight Club is still an entertaining film. It's funny, it's dark, and it provides a very honest depiction of mental illness that very few films have the balls to explore. Would I recommend it to everyone? Definitely not. I will say that it's most worthwhile audience would be people who are interested in films about insanity. It's one of the best ones you'll find, or at least one of the best ones that was released in the past couple of decades. The film has developed a strange cult following, reminiscent of the cult audience surrounding American Psycho. These people seem to feel that these two films contain deep philosophical messages about the nature of humanity, but they definitely don't. Sure, there's a lot going on in both of these films, and the characters may have a fascinating level of detail to them, but that does not mean that these films don't offer more than good entertainment and some ideas to think about. I don't think the characters in Fight Club should be taken seriously and I'm astounded that anyone even could take them seriously. It's like saying that Sonny in Dog Day Afternoon was right to rob the bank and that the police were all wrong. Both sides made mistakes and both sides learned things, but that doesn't change the finale of the film. If you're going to watch Fight Club, please don't try to watch it with an open-mind about the characters and the things that they say. Watch it knowing everything that you know now about politics, science, religion, and humanity. I'm sure that the film will have the desired effect on you.",4,Incredibly dark and very funny,1276992000,"06 20, 2010",2010,7222,"['Based', 'novel', 'Chuck', 'Palahniuk', 'Fight', 'Club', 'darker',

519191,AU5SQBPSNOIM,B00003CWQ2,"Vanissa W. Chan ""vandelist""","[2, 3]","This film attacks our capitalist culture, our obsessive materialistic individualistic mindsets, this film mocks our &quot;dreamer-couch-potato&quot; generation.  And it shines while it moons us with its smart remarks and its egotystical masturbation.  This film is a satirical masterpiece.I'll have to admit, I'm biased.  I love Fincher.  Se7en is by far my most-adored film.  Although I can talk forever about Se7en, I can probably talk more than forever about Fight Club, because the various themes incorporated in the film seem endless.To summarize without giving too much away, this film, adopted from Chuck Palahniuk's underground novel, is about the postmodern world, where children are raised by their television sitcoms and commercials.  Where children no longer look to their deadbeat fathers as role-models for God.  Where children abandon unfollowed dreams because their goals were &quot;too hard&quot; and they couldn't cut the slack while they were privileged enough to be in college but too busy pissing their money away and having promiscuous sex.  Where everyone has a of mental disorder of some kind and instead of accepting responsibility for their problems, continuously victimize themselves while receiving &quot;inner-child&quot; embraces from their local support group.  This film mocks and tackles all these issues, and more.It raises questions for our overstimulated lifestyles.  It questions us about our directions, our goals, our passions.  It asks us what we are really made of.  If we have all these dreams to become so great, to impact the world, to make a difference, than why don't we?  Why do we continue to rot in front of our t.v., picking our noses, and denying the most fulfilling activity in the world, self-transcendance?It admonishes us.  It threatens us.  Because living in a society where our immaterial needs are no longer met, where we are overwhelmed with our trivial material decisions and activities, there becomes a void inside of all of us.  All of a sudden, we are faced with the questions like, What is it like to feel pain?  What is it like to feel joy?  What is it like to feel exhilerating?  What is it like to live?From a more sociological perspective, the film's theme of the postmodern brainchild is a direct result of what social prophets, including Max Weber, Emile Durkheim, Aldous Huxley, and the controversial Karl Marx have long predicted.  The film wreaks of Marx philosophy with its show of disgust for what the commodification of life has done to our humanity.  All four social prophets agreed that the deterioration of the immaterial life would lead to the self-destruction of the human race, essentially what this apocalyptic story leads to.With performances by Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helen Bonham Carter, who play the roles they were &quot;born&quot; for, this film will, in the least, with no question, provoke you.The DVD itself:  A very honestly and tastefully done collection.  Included is a supplemental cd including several commentaries, deleted scenes, and &quot;the making of&quot; clips.  Also included is a hilarious compilation of quotes from both opposers and likers of the film.

Norton meets a soap salesman (Brad Pitt) on a bad plane ride home after who takes him in when Norton loses his home. This begins an odyssey for both where they found a fight club allowing men to reestablish their masculity that ultimately morphs into a militia type movement swallowing both.Don't be fooled by tne opening menu--Fincher has cleverly use the DVD menu for ""Never Been Kissed"" which makes it appear as if the Blu-ray might be the wrong one--it represents the themes of the film quite well about the deceptive surfaces that we perceive all around us.""Fight Club"" like a lot of Fincher's movies is an acquired taste but for those willing to join in and watch this combination of drama, action and satire, it's a worthwhile but bloody journey. Although not often discussed Fincher along with Chris Nolan is one of the few filmmakers who routinely challenges our assumptions about storytelling in films tackling a number of difficult stories, themes and manages to combine the artiness of someone like David Lynch into structured storytelling.The Blu-ray for ""Fight Club"" looks marvelous with a sharp, detailed presentation dominated by the yellow/brown color scheme and lighting of neon that has dominated his films since ""Se7en"".

I sat there blindsided, my jaw open, wondering ""What the hell is going on here? What is the point of this, as the story has already made its point?"".One might still raise that obejction, but a second viewing (on Blu-ray) reveals that Fincher drops subtle hints as to what is really going on. Further, what is hidden up to that point is thematically and psychologically consistent with the rest of the story.This is a film you have to experience and absorb on your own. But... it is absolutely /not/ about the (presumed) pleasure men take in beating up each other (though the title unfortunately suggests that). If you don't understand /why/ they fight, then you've missed one of the story's basic points. (Hint: It's not to affirm their masculinity in a feminized world.) This is not a story about sado-masochism or fascism. It is, as most great American films, an attack on American society and values.""Fight Club"" will someday be recognized as one of /the/ great American films. Why it's taking so long, I don't know.PS: Blu-ray navigation is occasionally confusing, but ""Fight Club"" is the hardest-to-navigate BD I've yet viewed. It's difficult to make exactly the selections you want among the options. And there are points in the selection process where everything seems to have locked up, and you have to press Play to get it to continue.

It is, in some ways, a metaphorical call to arms; a call to fight complacency and find meaning, rather than continue to trudge through the screaming pit of shallow, celebrity-driven consumerism that, until recently, seemed the primary arena of our existence.The story finds an unnamed Narrator (Edward Norton) at the end of his rope.  He's about my age; has a job and an office about like mine.  Like me, he's still single - the product of divorce, he doesn't trust marriage or committed relationships.  Like me, he buys stuff in an attempt to fill the void.  Like me, he wonders if it all means anything.  He's approaching a point of crisis - a crisis of nothing.  A big blank, where life has become a pretty but empty package.  He can't sleep.  To find some emotional catharsis, he goes to 12-step meetings, pretending to have a variety of diseases.  He finds understanding.  He finds release.Enter Marla Singer (Helena Bonham-Carter) and Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt).  They upset the applecart, and together, all three end up forming a strange triangle that will lead to a darkly comedic world of mischief, mayhem, and - of all things - soap.The titular concept is that of the ""Fight Club"" - a loosely organized group of Gen-Xers (started by Durden and Narrator) who meet periodically to test their mettle by beating the stuffing out of each other.  ""How can you know anything about yourself if you've never been in a fight?"" asks Durden, and he's right.  How do we know anything about the strength of our own character - how, in fact, can we even build character - without a struggle or fight of some kind to temper us?  Something that our generation has utterly lacked?""We are the middle children of history, man,"" says Durden, in the film's most important scene, ""No purpose or place.  We have no great war.  No great depression.  Our great war is a spiritual war.  Our great depression is our lives.""  And that's what Fight Club is all about.  It is a means of providing that great test of character in miniature.  Until, of course, it gets out of hand in the film's nihilistic second half.  In it, Fight Club evolves into a full-blown movement, turning outward to soft-core domestic terrorism, and the film becomes a bleak, Strangelovian meditation on Fascism.Even people who did not understand Fight Club could sense something powerful in it. One thinks of Roger Eberts' completely off-base and largely negative review that at least grudgingly acknowledges the film's solid cinematic technique.  Eberts' mistake is in thinking Fight Club attempts to be a morality tale of sorts; a simple-minded polemic.  By that standard, it certainly fails.  But Ebert is not Gen-X.  He's a Boomer, and Fight Club sails right past him.  Put simply, he doesn't get it, and probably never will.The DVD is a two-disc set, with lots of goodies - at least the equal of New Line's excellent Platinum Series release of Se7en.  The package is well-designed, the extras plentiful.  The picture and sound quality are simply exquisite.But what I want to end with - and this is by far the most important point - is not how good the DVD packaging is, but how relevant the film is, especially in light of recent events, when our world was changed forever by real terrorism, rather than the tongue-in-cheek icon-smashing variety depicted in Fight Club.The film was right in its central thesis - we needed something to give us direction, to unite us in a common cause, to develop our character as a generation.

It *is* a movie about a lot of the stuff that often makes American Society of the late 20th century so brutally depressing and unfulfilling, particularly from the point of view of lower working-class men. As such, it has a lot of interesting things to say about bonding, identity and social standards. Because of this, I found the first half of the movie absorbing and witty in a dark kind of way, full of grim humour and cutting observations. After that, however, it really lost its grip on me.The narrator (Edward Norton) is a literally anonymous corporate drone whose only pleasure in life is ordering kitchsy items from catalogues.  A period of insomnia sends him in search of emotional catharsis at various support groups for the terminally ill where he meets Myra (Helena Bonham Carter), another ""voyeur.""  Shortly thereafter, he meets travelling soap salesman Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a virtual human phrasebook of ""radical"" thought and recipes for making explosives from household products.  The two men discover the dubious transcendent experience of pummelling each other into oblivion and decide that this is what's missing from men's lives.  Thus the Fight Club is born.And that's where the movie lost me.  From that point onward, the cutting, and often humourous, observations about society were too much replaced by scenes of bare-chested men knocking each other about interspersed with Tyler Durden's pseudo-anarchistic dogma.  For someone who's never thought much about society's self-sustaining and materialistic hierarchy, Durden's observations might sound enlightened, but for me it got old really fast.  After about fifteen minutes, I felt as bludgeoned as the men in the club and it was all I could do not to turn the movie off.I was also disappointed in the way the Fight Club itself mutated from a place for men to find themselves and discover their power (however dubiously) into a kind of miltary organization that dehumanized the participants every bit as much as the society they were trying to combat.  Although this is pretty standard cult development, I found it depressing.  I look for movies of this sort to push the boundaries in new and different ways and offer new ideas, if not solutions.  _Fight Club_ didn't do that. It fell back on the same old revolutionary script and became just another movie about guys blowing things up while becoming the thing that they hate.  Was that the point?  I didn't know, and I got the impression that the movie didn't know, either.  It left me with a real feeling of futility.The acting is actually quite good, and a _Sixth Sense_ type plot twist towards the end goes a long way towards redeeming the middle portions of the film but doesn't quite manage it. _Fight Club_ is probably a good movie to see if you're feeling angry with the world and need to have your anger validated.

He's just pleased to know that in a world where even God doesn't know most people's name, there's another man who knows who Tyler Durden is.Tyler Durden lets Big Lou punch him repeatedly in the jaw, while laughing maniacally, mocking him and infuriating him. At the end of the scene, Tyler seems to make the point: Real men don't always beat the crap out of other men, Real Men laugh silly at other men who try their best to make them feel pain, but only fail repeatedly. How would you feel if you sucked in all the power you had, landed a blow on a dude, and he laughed in your face as if to say, ""That's your best shot?"" Not very good, I think.Tyler Durden [Brad Pitt] is the manifestation of every man's fantasy. Good-looking, brash, arrogant, fights like a tank, takes a beating like a tank, ****s like a machine and doesn't do any REAL work.The Narrator [Ed Norton] is the manifestation of most modern men's reality. Plain-looking, dead-end job, no stable relationship, a decent collection of lifestyle accessories and sheer boredom.When the two meet, you might expect the movie takes the usual route where the two men get to learn from each other, and find that each person's life has as many highs as pitfalls, and that your life is what you make of it. Err...no. Tyler is an enigma. A revolutionary of sorts. Hell, he isn't here to ""learn"" about the Narrator. He's here to ""Jack"" his life!!! Tyler Durden is a bigger, larger-than-life figure than James Bond, the Terminator or even Neo. He could easily steal any one of Bond's potential bed-mates from right under his nose. He could easily program the Terminator to believe its existence was useless and that it should self-terminate. He might even make Neo give-up and dump the whole ""Because I choose to.."" talk.This movie may not ""change"" your life, but it will affect it. You will develop a liking for red leather. You will start working on a new walk. You will start sizing people up everywhere you go. You will stop caring about the fact that you're a 6-foot 120-lbs weakling with 13"" biceps. You will start to think, ""I'm sure I could throw ONE good dislocating punch at a 220lbs biker even after I take 4 punches to my face"". You will want to be in better shape. You will cringe at the idea of a woman having any kind of control over your life. You will want to learn the art of dead-pan sarcasm that scares your boss out of his/her wits. Watch this movie, and you will wish that someday, people will ask, ""Say, Who is (insert your name)?""One of the better ""mainstream"" movies to have come out of Hollywood in recent years. Unless you exclusively like movies with a ""Made for Oscars"" plot [Disabled dude learns to appreciate life, WWII/Vietnam Veteran learn the value of human life,Gay Dude stands up against the system, etc.], you will have a hard time wondering why this movie didn't win a few dozen awards.

I'm also not overly fond of movies that throw out sociological themes by the dozen just to ""see what sticks"", which ""Fight Club"" also does quite a bit of.  Yet, in an exception to my personal ""rule"", this movie is so incredibly well-made that it easily vaults onto my ""favorite movies ever"" list.For a basic plot summary, ""Fight Club"" sees a down-and-out business man (Edward Norton) who is completely burnt out emotional, to the point where he actually goes to support groups for diseases he does not have just so he can emote.  One day, however, this man meets the mysterious Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), who takes charge of his life and completely transforms his personality from utterly passive to overly aggressive.  When things get out of hand, however, the pair are at odds over which way their future is headed.Minor Spoiler Alert: This is a movie with a ""twist"" ending.  As such, I won't really say anything more about the plot.  Suffice it to say, though, that ""Fight Club"" covers so much ground that it will feel like you've watched five movies in its time-span.  If you have seen ""The Mechanic"" with Christian Bale, this is a very similar experience.The hallmark of the whole ""Fight Club"" experience, though, is how director David Fincher seamlessly weaves the movie's far-reaching plot themes into something coherent, surprising, & exciting.  At no point in the experience will you feel as if you have this movie ""figured out""...but in this case that is a good thing!  The film is so deep on a sociological, physical, and emotional level that you'll almost feel a little ""wiped off"" from thought after viewing.The acting in ""Fight Club"" also very much suits the overall ""weird"" tone of the movie.  Norton & Pitt provide a nice compliment to each other, while Helena Bonham Carter is interesting in a role that actually has much more significance to the film than one might originally perceive.Simply put, the first time I saw ""Fight Club"" I was completely blown away by the whole concept.  Years later, I watched it again (this time from the ""knowing"" perspective) and was still blown away by its deep themes and interesting concepts.  I could probably watch it again and still catch new things.  So, no matter how weird this movie gets, please DO NOT bail out before the end, where everything finally comes together and begins to make a bit more sense.

It is, in fact, by far one of the most unique and eccentric films that I have ever had the pleasure to witness.  And a true pleasure it undoubtedly was.  In fact, I wish that I could make this a well-rounded review with adequate portions of praises and criticisms, but it is just too well-done, too visually appealing, too imaginative of a film to be attributed with any minute, negative traits.  This is a film that sets about redefining the style of filmmaking; the fact that it succeeds establishes this film as one of the all-time greatest.  Every moment, visual, line, and character is a forward leap in filmmaking that never fails to inspire and impress.First of all, before you ever realize how psychologically deep it is, you'll find it hilarious.  With great attention to the idiosyncratic clash between ""civilized"" culture and the counterculture that opposes it, Fight Club satirizes every institution to great depth.  Nothing is sacred; nothing is revered.  Moreover, visual effects are utilized to a new end, not simply as a device to convey plot, but also to expand the mood, the momentum, and the character psychology.  But as the film continues, as the characters grow and the situation becomes increasingly dire, one can't help but be pulled into this neurotic visualization of criminal life.  It is a story and a set of characters that pulls you into a new world and makes you seriously question the one that you have lived in for all of your life.And all of this couldn't have happened without truly magnificent performances.  Edward Norton is always great, but offers a multi-faceted performance that rivals his more appreciated works.  Brad Pitt is perfect for the role; no one else could have played it as effectively.  And then there is Helena Bonham Carter who is...Weird--and that's what makes her great.  The direction is ambitious and enthusiastic, both heavily to the film's credit.  By being so eccentric, the direction obviously sets and then expands upon the mood from the opening credits to the very last shot--arguably one of the greatest concluding shots in film history.  But none of this would have had any great impact without the clever and meticulous script that always offers a surprise and maintains the momentum during every scene.And so all of this culminates into what has now become one of my all-time favorite films.  There are just so many great ideas offered, so many interesting characters and perversely fascinating images, and moreover such a psychologically profound story that one cannot help but become enthralled with this masterwork of new age filmmaking.  But beyond that, it sets a style that people will be mimicking for some time, but with lesser success.  Fight Club stands as one of the most unique and inspiring films of the 90's.

519222,A2IBS27RBKV3LJ,B00003CWQ2,"Zorikh Lequidre ""Zorikh""","[5, 5]","It's a manifesto of facist overthrow! It's a battle cry against complacent consumerism! It's an indulgent work of beautifully shot violence! It's a work showing great promise and brilliance with a cop-out ending! It's a  floor wax! It's a breakfast cereal! Just scan through a few of the reviews  and you'll see these and many other opinions and interpretations of this  movie, all of them strong in their conviction that they are right. Some of  the greatest works of art inspire this sort of reaction.I am willing to  weigh in on the side of this being a great work. I found it captivating,  inspiring, and chock full of personal significance. For me it was a movie  about beating complacency and finding how you are most alive, not sweating  irrelevancies and getting to the heart of what you find fulfilling. It  makes a case for breaking free of what could be called a &quot;comfort  zone&quot; and scraping off the barnacles of a meaningless existence. It  did not promote total revolution, nihilism, or anarchy, but did speak to me  to encourage focus and &quot;letting slide that which does not truly  matter.&quot; I found personal significance because I had been letting my  life get pointless for the past few years, aimlessly stagnating in a dumb  office job and going through a series of predictably limited relationships.  My latest girlfriend had been getting on my case to clear out my room and  get a better job. So my next gig was with a show that toured for three  months, and while on the road I saw this. Meanwhile, she moved into my  building and then broke up with me and soon was dating one of my roomates.  This really helped me relate to the message that no one's just gonna give  you something, you gotta do something yourself. Live to the fullest. I  contemplated this as I lived a life of &quot;single-serving&quot; homes (a  different motel every night) and sought meaning in a life where my love had  left me for a so-called friend.To me, the story was about someone who  had fallen into an unsatisfyingly complacent existence and then discovered  something new that intrigued him. When his old life is irreparably  shattered, he turns to that intriguing new thing and finds that it empowers  him to take what he wants, even if he doesn't realize it. Of course there  are many levels to this, and many interpretations, but this is what it said  to me.I didn't get an urge to tear down society, but the movie did give  me a look at living life more fully and going for what you deserve,  whatever it is.",4,"ONE BRILLIANT, BEAUTIFAUL, INTENSE RORSHARCH BLOT!",960940800,"06 14, 2000",2000,2533,"['manifesto', 'facist', 'overthrow', 'battle', 'cry', 'complacent', 'consumerism', 'indulgent', 'work', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'violence', 'work', 'showing', 'great', 'promise', 'brilliance', 'cop-out', 'ending', 'floor', 'wax', 'breakfast', 'cereal', 'Just', 'scan', 'few', 'reviews', ""'ll"", 'see', 'many', 'other', 'opinions', 'interpretations', 'movie', 'strong', 'conviction', 'are', 'right', 'greatest', 'works', 'art', 'inspire', 'sort', 'reaction.I', 'am', 'willing', 'weigh', 'side', 'being', 'great', 'work', 'found', 'captivating', 'inspiring', 'chock', 'full', 'personal', 'significance', 'was', 'movie', 'beating', 'complacency', 'finding', 'how', 'are', 'most', 'alive', 'not', 'sweating', 'irrelevancies', 'getting', 'heart', 'what', 'find', 'fulfilling', 'case', 'breaking', 'free', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'called', 'quot', 'comfort', 'zone', 'quot', 'scraping', 'off', 'barnacles', 'meaningless', 'existence', 'did', 'not', 'promote', 'total', 'revolution', 'nihilism', 'anarchy', 'did', 'speak', 'encourage', 'focus', 'quot', 'letting', 'slide', 'not', 'truly', 'matter.', 'quot', 'found', 'personal', 'significance', 'had', 'been', 'letting', 'life', 'get', 'pointless', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'aimlessly', 'stagnating', 'dumb', 'office', 'job', 'going', 'series', 'predictably', 'limited', 'relationships', 'latest', 'girlfriend', 'had', 'been', 'getting', 'case', 'clear', 'out', 'room', 'get', 'better', 'job', 'next', 'gig', 'was', 'show', 'toured', 'three', 'months', 'road', 'saw', 'Meanwhile', 'moved', 'building', 'then', 'broke', 'up', 'soon', 'was', 'dating', 'one', 'roomates', 'really', 'helped', 'relate', 'message', 'one', 'just', 'gon', 'give', 'something', 'got', 'ta', 'do', 'something', 'Live', 'fullest', 'contemplated', 'lived', 'life', 'quot', 'single-serving', 'quot', 'homes', 'different', 'motel', 'night', 'sought', 'meaning', 'life', 'where', 'love', 'had', 'left', 'so-called', 'friend.To', 'story', 'was', 'someone', 'who', 'had', 'fallen', 'unsatisfyingly', 'complacent', 'existence', 'then', 'discovered', 'something', 'new', 'intrigued', 'When', 'old', 'life', 'irreparably', 'shattered', 'intriguing', 'new', 'thing', 'take', 'what', 'even', ""n't"", 'realize', 'course', 'are', 'many', 'levels', 'many', 'interpretations', 'what', 'said', 'me.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'urge', 'tear', 'down', 'society', 'movie', 'did', 'give', 'look', 'living', 'life', 'more', 'fully', 'going', 'what', 'deserve', 'whatever']",N/A
