1057523,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000NJWIPI,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","`The Secret Life of Words' was one of those films that just slipped in under the radar so-to-speak.  I had head a lot about it and then it all but disappeared before I noticed it on the shelf at my local video store and remembered all that I had heard.  I immediately grabbed the movie and I can honestly say it was well worth it.  The film is a quiet film yet it speaks volumes with its emotional depth.  This is of course aided strongly by the brilliant performances by the cast, especially Tim Robbins.  Robbins is slowly but surely becoming one of my favorite working actors, and I know that may sound odd since he's been acting for some time now, but recently his brilliance has really come through.  His performance here is no exception.`The Secret Life of Words' follows a young woman named Hanna who is obviously stilted by events in her past that cause her to be distant from others, to be reclusive.  She even admits to being somewhat prejudice and gives off the air of someone almost bothered by the people around her, thus opting to turn down her hearing aids so as not to have to listen to them talk.  It's because of this persona that she's all but forced to take a vacation by her boss who doesn't want to fire her but has to confront her about the impression she leaves on her workmates.  Instead of choosing a pretty place to vacate she ends up choosing to work.  She overhears the need for a nurse and she takes the job.  Hanna then finds herself on an oil rig off the coast of Northern Ireland taking care of Josef, a man burned badly in a fire aboard the rig.  Josef is left temporarily blind yet he still is as conversational as could be.  He's persistent with Hanna, trying to get her to open up and slowly the two begin to unveil just who they really are.The film on its own is very well done, but it's really Tim Robbins who catapults this into a must see feature.  His performance is so naturally inviting, so absorbing that I'm tempted to say it could be a career best for him.  I love Polley, lord knows that.  Her supporting performance in `The Sweet Hereafter' is one of my favorite supporting performances ever, but here I feel she's a bit miscast.  She does fine, don't get me wrong, and she truly uncovers all that is Hanna.  It's just that accent that I couldn't get past.  I really didn't feel it was real from her.  I know she must have worked hard for it, but it came off a bit too forced for me, not natural.  She played her characters emotions fantastically, but she was quickly overshadowed by Robbins.In the end, `The Secret Life of Words' is a film I'd recommend readily.  It delivers on just about every front and contains one of the best performances of the past decade in my opinion.  One reviewer used the word poetic when describing this film and I must agree.  Writer/Director Isabel Coixet has a lot of potential and I see greatness in her future.  I've yet to see `My Life Without Me', also starring Sarah Polley, but if it's anything like this film then I'll be sure to find it and watch it very soon.",4,"Intriguing and absorbing, truly memorable thanks in large part to a truly orgasmic performance...",1189987200,"09 17, 2007",2007,3051,"['Secret', 'Life', 'Words', 'was', 'one', 'films', 'just', 'slipped', 'radar', 'so-to-speak', 'had', 'head', 'lot', 'then', 'disappeared', 'noticed', 'shelf', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'remembered', 'had', 'heard', 'immediately', 'grabbed', 'movie', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'was', 'well', 'worth', 'film', 'quiet', 'film', 'yet', 'volumes', 'emotional', 'depth', 'course', 'aided', 'strongly', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'cast', 'especially', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'Robbins', 'slowly', 'surely', 'becoming', 'one', 'favorite', 'working', 'actors', 'know', 'may', 'sound', 'odd', 'been', 'acting', 'time', 'now', 'recently', 'brilliance', 'really', 'come', 'performance', 'here', 'exception.', 'Secret', 'Life', 'Words', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Hanna', 'who', 'obviously', 'stilted', 'events', 'past', 'cause', 'be', 'distant', 'others', 'be', 'reclusive', 'even', 'being', 'somewhat', 'prejudice', 'off', 'air', 'someone', 'almost', 'bothered', 'people', 'thus', 'opting', 'turn', 'down', 'hearing', 'aids', 'so', 'not', 'have', 'listen', 'talk', 'persona', 'forced', 'take', 'vacation', 'boss', 'who', ""n't"", 'want', 'fire', 'confront', 'impression', 'workmates', 'Instead', 'choosing', 'pretty', 'place', 'vacate', 'up', 'choosing', 'work', 'need', 'nurse', 'job', 'Hanna', 'then', 'oil', 'rig', 'coast', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'taking', 'care', 'Josef', 'man', 'burned', 'badly', 'fire', 'rig', 'Josef', 'left', 'temporarily', 'blind', 'yet', 'still', 'as', 'conversational', 'could', 'be', 'persistent', 'Hanna', 'trying', 'get', 'open', 'up', 'slowly', 'two', 'begin', 'unveil', 'just', 'who', 'really', 'are.The', 'film', 'own', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'really', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'who', 'catapults', 'must', 'see', 'feature', 'performance', 'so', 'naturally', 'inviting', 'so', 'absorbing', ""'m"", 'tempted', 'say', 'could', 'be', 'career', 'best', 'love', 'Polley', 'lord', 'supporting', 'performance', 'Sweet', 'Hereafter', 'one', 'favorite', 'supporting', 'performances', 'ever', 'here', 'feel', 'bit', 'miscast', 'fine', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'truly', 'uncovers', 'Hanna', 'just', 'accent', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'past', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'real', 'know', 'must', 'have', 'worked', 'hard', 'came', 'off', 'bit', 'too', 'forced', 'not', 'natural', 'played', 'characters', 'emotions', 'fantastically', 'was', 'quickly', 'overshadowed', 'Robbins.In', 'end', 'Secret', 'Life', 'Words', 'film', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'readily', 'just', 'front', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'past', 'decade', 'opinion', 'One', 'reviewer', 'used', 'word', 'poetic', 'when', 'describing', 'film', 'must', 'agree', 'Writer/Director', 'Isabel', 'Coixet', 'lot', 'potential', 'see', 'greatness', 'future', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'see', 'Life', 'Me', 'also', 'starring', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'anything', 'film', 'then', ""'ll"", 'be', 'sure', 'find', 'watch', 'very', 'soon']",N/A

In fact, it becomes almost trite, in a ""love conquers all"" kind of way.Tim Robbins' character's chatter didn't make him seem substantial enough to take on other people's baggage, and that detracted from the credibility of his behavior following his recovery as a burn victim, nursed by Hanna (Sarah Polley).

And the exchange between the cook and the burn patient when the cook brought him his meal; I didn't get that, either. If other viewers can enlighten me, please ""comment"" below.

1057528,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000NJWIPI,Grady Harp,"[29, 31]","It is always a joy to find a DVD in the videostore that is completely an unknown entity, only to discover upon viewing it that it is a little masterpiece of cinematic art.  Such is the case with THE SECRET LIFE OF WORDS, and having seen the film now raises the question of how it went unnoticed in the theater release.  Though touted on the cover as an 'Almod&oacute;var film', in reality it's connection to the genius lies in the fact that both Pedro and his brother Agust&iacute;n Almod&oacute;var were executive producers: the film was written and directed by Spanish artist Isabel Coixet (Paris, je t'aime, Invisibles, My Life Without Me). It is a minimalist statement about the indomitable human spirit, a story that slowly unwinds to reveal some of the most terrifying aspects of trauma of war and guilt and shame ever written.Hanna (Sarah Polley, in a phenomenal performance) is a deaf, silent reclusive young woman working as a line operator in a factory, so married to her meaningless job that her boss insists she take a vacation she deserves. Hanna does as she's told, and journeys to a seaside spot where she hears about a man on an oil rig in the middle of the ocean who is severely burned and needs a nurse. Hanna quietly takes the job, is flown by the doctor (Steven Mackintosh) to the isolated oil rig, populated with only a few men - cook Simon (Javier C&aacute;mara of 'Hable con ella', 'La Mala educaci&oacute;n, 'Luc&iacute;a y el sexo' etc), oceanographer and  workers (Eddie Marsan, Daniel Mays, Dean Lennox Kelly, Danny Cunningham, Emmanuel Idowu) and a captain (Steven Mackintosh), and meets her patient Josef (Tim Robbins) who is temporarily blinded from burns to his corneas, and severely burned on his limbs.Josef seeks to discover information from Hanna, but Hanna shares nothing  about herself, spending her time dressing Josef's wounds, feeding him and tending to his needs. He slowly reveals his painful past to her (he was burned in an accident in which his best friend was burned to death, the friend whose wife had become Josef's lover!).  Hanna is treated well by the few men on the isolated rig and learns to eat the exotic foods prepared by Simon, becoming friends with the crew, though at a distance, and gradually Hanna speaks with Josef about herself.  In a painful confessional Hanna reveals that she is Bosnian and a survivor of the Balkan war, a hideous time when she and her close friend were captured, tortured and raped, leaving Hanna with physical as well as psychic scars and an enormous feeling of shame that her friend died and she survived.  This knowledge bonds Hanna and Josef, but by this point it is time for Josef to be medevaced to a hospital onshore and the two part company.  After some time has passed and Josef has recovered, he begins his search for Hanna and the journey and its finale serve as a touching end to the story.The cast is uniformly brilliant, including a small role of Hanna's therapist played convincingly by Julie Christie.  The metaphors the tale offers are many, but the most moving is an examination of how the human mind deals with survival and shame after trauma.  Director Isabel Coixet draws such subtle performances from the entire cast in this very small film, proving she is one of the more important artists in film making today.  Very Highly Recommended.

The film opens with a child's voice: are these words from the main character Hanna, representing the remnant of a childhood past, a fleeting ghost of safety? Or is it the inner voice, the inner words, that only Hanna can hear, since a violent and brutal war in the Balkans left her deaf? Or is this child's voice a vain attempt to make the movie deeper than it really is? I vote for the later.The acting in the film is adequate; the location, an isolated oil rig, tenuously and temporarily alive in the middle of a threatening sea, is apt.

1057543,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000NJWIPI,Tsuyoshi,"[60, 63]","""The Secret Life of Words"" is directed by Isabel Coixet (""My Life without Me""). In this quiet film Sarah Polley is Hanna silently working at a factory, keeping to herself in her life. One day her boss tells her to take a vacation even though Hanna doesn't seem to enjoy the idea. Still she travels to a seaside town, where she finds nothing to do. While having a lunch at a local Chinese restaurant, however, she hears about Josef (Tim Robbins), severely burnt victim of a fire at an offshore oil rig.Hanna volunteers to nurse him and flies to the isolated site where not many things happen. There Hanna cares for Josef, who cannot see her face, wearing a bandage over his eyes because of injury. Josef keeps talking to Hanna, asking her questions while telling her a few things about him. As the film slowly goes on, Hanna, not the most sociable nurse in the world, still starts to reveal her past, which is related to the events that happened in her native country years ago.Supporting actors include Javier C&aacute;mara, Steven Mackintosh, Eddie Marsan, Daniel Mays and Julie Christie, plus cameo of Leonor Watling. Though her screen time is short, Julie Christie is wonderful as Inge who cares for Hanna. (Inge's character is based on the real-life person Denmark-born Dr. Inge Genefke of IRCT.) But the film virtually belongs to the two leading actors, Sarah Polley and Tim Robbins.Not many ""actions"" happen during the film which heavily depends on the words the characters speak. Some may think the film's pace is too slow and its story boring while others may find the understated tone essential to the spiritual changes that main characters Hanna and Josef undergo. The poetical and slightly surreal quality of the film (opening and ending voiceovers, for example) will either attract or puzzle viewers.Sarah Polley's Hanna uses English with a strong accent. Her acting is fantastic as always, but I thought Canadian-born Sarah Polley may not be the best choice for the role of Hanna, whose nationality plays an important part in the film. And probably the character of Josef needs to be more substantial for the relations between them to develop fully to the extent the film's last chapter shows to us.In ""The Secret Life of Words"" the ""actions"" have already happened before the film starts. You slowly come to know the nature of the actions or secrets through the words Hanna and Josef speak. Despite its overlong running time, I liked the film for its quietness and subdued approach, but some may not love the film for the very same reason.",4,"(3.5 STARS) ""The Secret Life of Words"": Quiet and Poetic with One Very Serious Theme",1176508800,"04 14, 2007",2007,2552,"['Secret', 'Life', 'Words', 'directed', 'Isabel', 'Coixet', 'Life', 'Me', 'quiet', 'film', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'Hanna', 'silently', 'working', 'factory', 'keeping', 'herself', 'life', 'One', 'day', 'boss', 'take', 'vacation', 'even', 'Hanna', ""n't"", 'seem', 'enjoy', 'idea', 'Still', 'seaside', 'town', 'where', 'nothing', 'do', 'having', 'lunch', 'local', 'Chinese', 'restaurant', 'however', 'Josef', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'severely', 'burnt', 'victim', 'fire', 'offshore', 'oil', 'rig.Hanna', 'volunteers', 'nurse', 'flies', 'isolated', 'site', 'where', 'not', 'many', 'things', 'happen', 'Hanna', 'cares', 'Josef', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'face', 'wearing', 'bandage', 'eyes', 'injury', 'Josef', 'talking', 'Hanna', 'asking', 'questions', 'telling', 'few', 'things', 'film', 'slowly', 'Hanna', 'not', 'most', 'sociable', 'nurse', 'world', 'still', 'reveal', 'past', 'related', 'events', 'happened', 'native', 'country', 'years', 'ago.Supporting', 'actors', 'include', 'Javier', 'C', 'aacute', 'Steven', 'Mackintosh', 'Eddie', 'Marsan', 'Daniel', 'Mays', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'cameo', 'Leonor', 'Watling', 'screen', 'time', 'short', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'wonderful', 'Inge', 'who', 'Hanna', 'Inge', 'character', 'based', 'real-life', 'person', 'Denmark-born', 'Dr.', 'Inge', 'Genefke', 'IRCT', 'film', 'virtually', 'two', 'leading', 'actors', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'Tim', 'Robbins.Not', 'many', 'actions', 'happen', 'film', 'heavily', 'words', 'characters', 'speak', 'may', 'think', 'film', 'pace', 'too', 'slow', 'story', 'boring', 'others', 'may', 'find', 'understated', 'tone', 'essential', 'spiritual', 'changes', 'main', 'characters', 'Hanna', 'Josef', 'undergo', 'poetical', 'slightly', 'surreal', 'quality', 'film', 'opening', 'ending', 'voiceovers', 'example', 'will', 'attract', 'puzzle', 'viewers.Sarah', 'Polley', 'Hanna', 'English', 'strong', 'accent', 'acting', 'fantastic', 'always', 'thought', 'Canadian-born', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'choice', 'role', 'Hanna', 'nationality', 'important', 'part', 'film', 'probably', 'character', 'Josef', 'be', 'more', 'substantial', 'relations', 'develop', 'fully', 'extent', 'film', 'last', 'chapter', 'shows', 'us.In', 'Secret', 'Life', 'Words', 'actions', 'have', 'already', 'happened', 'film', 'slowly', 'come', 'know', 'nature', 'actions', 'secrets', 'words', 'Hanna', 'Josef', 'speak', 'overlong', 'running', 'time', 'liked', 'film', 'quietness', 'subdued', 'approach', 'may', 'not', 'love', 'film', 'very', 'same', 'reason']",N/A
1057544,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B000NJWIPI,Z Hayes,"[0, 0]","""The Secret Life of Words"" was a difficult movie to watch because it focuses on the tortured lives of two individuals. Hanna (Sarah Polley) is a hearing-impaired young woman who quietly goes about her daily life which consists of working in a factory, and keeping pretty much to herself. When her employer forces her to take a vacation (due to union laws, Hanna has to take the time off or lose her job), Hanna decides to go on a short vacation nearby, but unable to just rest and enjoy herself, Hanna offers her services to nurse a severely injured worker on a remote oil rig.At this point, the viewer learns that Hanna used to be a nurse in her native land (somewhere in the Balkans). The injured worker has been temporarily blinded in the accident and has also suffered severe burns. As Hanna nurses him, Josef (Tim Robbins) begins to develop an interest in Hanna, partly because of her secretive and quiet nature. Hanna's resistance gradually wears down and both Josef and Hanna not only find themselves gravitating toward each other but also discover each other's darkest secret.The movie was initially confusing to me because there is a child's voice at the beginning. It was confusing because there is no context for this voice over and the viewer needs to puzzle out who this child is. It is only much later that the viewer is able to guess as to the role of the child in this movie. Sarah Polley does an amazing job as the tormented Hanna who is unable to lead a normal life because of the horrific nature of her past - a past so terrible and painful that Hanna is unable to relate to humans on a normal level. The only person that has any sort of relationship with Hanna is her therapist, who is credibly played by Julie Christie. The movie moves painfully slow at times, yet it is necessary to show the development of Hanna's character. Tim Robbins ably plays the male lead whose gentleness and vulnerability provides Hanna with the means to come out of her self-imposed silence.This movie is not for everyone, but those who appreciate good character development and serious drama might find it a haunting and compelling watch, as I did.",5,Haunting story of two tortured souls,1295222400,"01 17, 2011",2011,2148,"['Secret', 'Life', 'Words', 'was', 'difficult', 'movie', 'watch', 'tortured', 'lives', 'two', 'individuals', 'Hanna', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'hearing-impaired', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'quietly', 'daily', 'life', 'working', 'factory', 'keeping', 'pretty', 'much', 'herself', 'When', 'employer', 'take', 'vacation', 'due', 'union', 'laws', 'Hanna', 'take', 'time', 'off', 'lose', 'job', 'Hanna', 'go', 'short', 'vacation', 'nearby', 'unable', 'just', 'rest', 'enjoy', 'Hanna', 'services', 'nurse', 'severely', 'injured', 'worker', 'remote', 'oil', 'rig.At', 'point', 'viewer', 'Hanna', 'used', 'be', 'nurse', 'native', 'land', 'somewhere', 'Balkans', 'injured', 'worker', 'been', 'temporarily', 'blinded', 'accident', 'also', 'suffered', 'severe', 'burns', 'Hanna', 'Josef', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'develop', 'interest', 'Hanna', 'partly', 'secretive', 'quiet', 'nature', 'Hanna', 'resistance', 'gradually', 'down', 'Josef', 'Hanna', 'not', 'only', 'find', 'gravitating', 'other', 'also', 'discover', 'other', 'darkest', 'secret.The', 'movie', 'was', 'initially', 'confusing', 'child', 'voice', 'beginning', 'was', 'confusing', 'context', 'voice', 'viewer', 'puzzle', 'out', 'who', 'child', 'only', 'much', 'later', 'viewer', 'able', 'guess', 'role', 'child', 'movie', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'amazing', 'job', 'tormented', 'Hanna', 'who', 'unable', 'lead', 'normal', 'life', 'horrific', 'nature', 'past', 'past', 'so', 'terrible', 'painful', 'Hanna', 'unable', 'relate', 'humans', 'normal', 'level', 'only', 'person', 'sort', 'relationship', 'Hanna', 'therapist', 'who', 'credibly', 'played', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'movie', 'painfully', 'slow', 'times', 'necessary', 'show', 'development', 'Hanna', 'character', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'ably', 'male', 'lead', 'gentleness', 'vulnerability', 'Hanna', 'means', 'come', 'self-imposed', 'silence.This', 'movie', 'not', 'everyone', 'who', 'appreciate', 'good', 'character', 'development', 'serious', 'drama', 'might', 'find', 'haunting', 'compelling', 'watch', 'did']",N/A
