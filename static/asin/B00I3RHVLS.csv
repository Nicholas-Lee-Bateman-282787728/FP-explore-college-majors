1693388,A1VWHBVNS1P2N3,B00I3RHVLS,George Redding,"[0, 0]","In this Mysteries series from Allied Artists Pictures, Bill Elliott is rough as ever, but instead of looking like the cowboy with boots and spurs, he is a well-dressed, comparatively sophisticated-looking man in the large twentieth-century Los Angeles County. In some ways, the physical attributes in the movies of this mystery series are similar: there are fist-fights and gun fights. On the other hand, there are some differences. Again, Bill Elliott (as Lt. Andy Flynn in the first movie and then as Lt. Andy Doyle in the subsequent films) is nicely and professionally dressed in dark suit, dark necktie, and white shirt. Character-wise, he is as rough, low-keyed, and awe-inspiring as in any of his previous westerns. In the last three films of this series. The short and stocky tough-guy character actor Dan Haggerty gives strong  support as his partner Sgt. Mike Duncan in the last three of these films. And in all the films he is also given support by cast members Helene Stanley, Keith Larsen, James Best, and Lyle Talbot, just to name a few. The films are attention-maintaining and exciting, and thus are worth the time to see them.",5,but instead of looking like the cowboy with boots and spurs,1405728000,"07 19, 2014",2014,1141,"['Mysteries', 'series', 'Allied', 'Artists', 'Pictures', 'Bill', 'Elliott', 'rough', 'ever', 'instead', 'looking', 'cowboy', 'boots', 'spurs', 'well-dressed', 'comparatively', 'sophisticated-looking', 'man', 'large', 'twentieth-century', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'County', 'ways', 'physical', 'attributes', 'movies', 'mystery', 'series', 'are', 'similar', 'are', 'fist-fights', 'gun', 'fights', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'differences', 'Again', 'Bill', 'Elliott', 'Lt.', 'Andy', 'Flynn', 'first', 'movie', 'then', 'Lt.', 'Andy', 'Doyle', 'subsequent', 'films', 'nicely', 'professionally', 'dressed', 'dark', 'suit', 'dark', 'necktie', 'white', 'shirt', 'Character-wise', 'rough', 'low-keyed', 'awe-inspiring', 'previous', 'westerns', 'last', 'three', 'films', 'series', 'short', 'stocky', 'tough-guy', 'character', 'actor', 'Dan', 'Haggerty', 'strong', 'support', 'partner', 'Sgt', 'Mike', 'Duncan', 'last', 'three', 'films', 'films', 'also', 'given', 'support', 'cast', 'members', 'Helene', 'Stanley', 'Keith', 'Larsen', 'James', 'Best', 'Lyle', 'Talbot', 'just', 'name', 'few', 'films', 'are', 'attention-maintaining', 'exciting', 'thus', 'are', 'time', 'see']",Bill Elliott Mysteries
1693389,A1QJWSIFDMXI9D,B00I3RHVLS,Mr. David Mcallister,"[12, 12]","This set of five detective stories from the 1950s starring western star Bill Elliott ,is a little gem in so many ways, and is beautifullypackaged and presented. Elliott is a very nice surprise as a lieutenant in the Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department solvinginteresting crimes in a laid back, no nonsense manner. Nice to watch him work in his slow and confident  style without all the modernwham bam frenzy of movement and noise that dominate modern day police shows.Some nice supporting actors do their thing and the direction is tight and unfussy. Marlin Skiles music plays a big part in moving eachshow along.I enjoyed every minute of this DVD and have just ordered an Elliott western to watch him in action out from behind a desk and on a horse !Top marks to Warners for this release.

1693390,A628MJW3RF0K4,B00I3RHVLS,R. B. Benedictson,"[10, 10]",Wild Bill Elliott as he was known in his western films ended his career at Monogram Pictures with five mystery films in modern day adventures.  These films were made in the mid to late 1950'S.  It seemed strange to see Bill driving a car rather chasing down the bad guys astride his horse &#34;Stormy&#34;.  His real name was Gordon Nance but changed it to Elliott for films.  These five entries were well produced and Bill did an excellent acting job.  I would recommend this five DVD collection for your collection.,4,Bill Elliott Mysteries,1394755200,"03 14, 2014",2014,517,"['Wild', 'Bill', 'Elliott', 'was', 'known', 'western', 'films', 'ended', 'career', 'Monogram', 'Pictures', 'five', 'mystery', 'films', 'modern', 'day', 'adventures', 'films', 'were', 'made', 'mid', 'late', '1950', 'seemed', 'strange', 'see', 'Bill', 'driving', 'car', 'rather', 'chasing', 'down', 'bad', 'guys', 'horse', '34', 'Stormy', '34', 'real', 'name', 'was', 'Gordon', 'Nance', 'changed', 'Elliott', 'films', 'five', 'entries', 'were', 'well', 'produced', 'Bill', 'did', 'excellent', 'acting', 'job', 'would', 'recommend', 'five', 'DVD', 'collection', 'collection']",Bill Elliott Mysteries

The set, as with others purchased, arrived in good condition and picture and sound quality were both first class. Now these films are almost 60 years old and were shot with a minimal budget so, with running times of 65 minutes or less, don't expect complicated plots or in depth characterisations. Nor should you look for CSI forensics, these films were made in the days whereby the case was solved by the heroes instinct and hunches. Having said all that, I enjoyed sitting back and watching this undemanding fare.
