1694797,A268TJ88VHO5IP,B00IS6WQ2S,Arbitrator,"[0, 2]","I love TV westerns and this is a good one. It only suffers in comparison with Gunsmoke, a legendary series which necessarily has to be compared since, well to put it bluntly if not too diplomatically, Cimarron Strip is a Gunsmoke ripoff. Or &#34;clone&#34;, to be more polite.Consider the similarities:1. Dodge City and Cimarron are frontier towns &#34;tamed&#34; by an overworked marshal in the late 1800's U.S. Western frontier.2. The marshal is assisted by a crew of seemingly borderline competent (or incompetent) deputies.3. The marshal is platonically involved with a woman in the &#34;hospitality&#34; business who loves him silently from afar.4. The townspeople are a mix of generally honest but chronically cowardly folks who tolerate the law but frequently also tolerate those who run afoul of it.But there are sizeable differences as well, which account for why Cimarron Strip doesn't compare well with Gunsmoke:1. The marshal, Jim Crown, played by a capable Stuart Whitman, does a capable job but he lacks the depth, humanity and subtle sense of humor of Matt Dillon, played by the incomparable James Arness.2. Gunsmoke's deputies, Chester Goode and then Festus Hagen, while often the butt of jokes and played maximally silly by Dennis Weaver and Ken Curtis, nonetheless have depth to them and are often competent and skilled enough to carry the day. Many a Gunsmoke episode has been built almost entirely around the deputies. The two deputies in Cimarron Strip generally overact horribly and invariably their in-character behavior is totally incompetent: more than one episode gets its storyline from either deputy screwing up and letting a villain escape jail.3. The platonic loves are generally comparable, although Miss Kitty starts out her career as a madame of ill repute where Dulcey appears to have never dabbled in fulfilling that particular cowboy need in her establishment. Jill Townsend is much younger than Amanda Blake and her appeal is more fresh-faced and homespun; blue-eyed and straw-spun blonde, it's worth watching some episodes just to see her bite her lower lip with her cute overbite!4. The rest of the CS cast just doesn't compare. Doc is a powerful and important figure in Gunsmoke; the doc in Cimarron is a cipher, barely making any appearances and when he does it's just to bandage up a wound and devoid of the homey sayings and witticism of Gunsmoke's legendary physician.Gunsmoke scripts are for the most part far superior as well. An ordinary Gunsmoke episode, particular from the black-and-white era, is superior to the best story ever told on Cimarron Strip. Of course, Marshal Crown only had one season riding his mount across the Strip... perhaps things would have improved over the years.

1694799,A28JINLDJZBVHI,B00IS6WQ2S,"David Walstad ""SC Vandy""","[35, 37]","One of my favorites is finally getting the official DVD treatment, but everyone's legitimate gripe / complaint will surely be that the episodes' running times indicate we'll be viewing cut-down, syndication prints.  Why should the distributor expect consumers to pay $70 USD and upwards for incomplete episodes, the same versions that have been repeated to death?!  As to the video and sound quality we can &#34;hope for the best.&#34;  Because, this long-awaited-for set is not being re-mastered and released by CBS who provided those sharp-looking &#34;Gunsmoke,&#34; &#34;Rawhide&#34; and &#34;Have Gun - Will Travel&#34; DVD sets.  Unlike the 75-minute running times of another 90-minute western, the official DVD versions of &#34;The Virginian's&#34; 1967-68 episodes, the average running time of these precious 23 &#34;Cimarron Strip&#34; episodes is only 70-and-a-half minutes (70.4 mins./ea.).  That's the same length they were when when Encore Westerns ran them, but not CBS in 1967-68; a few minutes short.  The series' star Stuart Whitman owns the rights to his show and surely is instrumental in all aspects of its post network life (just as he was 47 years ago in its CBS life).  I have to wonder if the film vaults of Hollywood weren't thoroughly searched for the missing &#34;trims&#34; in order that they be re-inserted into the 35mm masters.  Or even utilize CBS's back-up 16mm prints to obtain the missing minutes.  To verify the running time discrepancies fortunately I possess a copy of each episodes' timesheet distributed to appropriate parties by the Silverbach-Lazarus Group, the company that at one time possessed the syndication rights.  At most of the act breaks there's three minutes of &#34;black&#34; indicating / specifying to the local stations' editors how many minutes and seconds of commercials, promos, PSAs and IDs could be inserted at each break.  In the 1960s an act break on a network primetime program was only one minute; at most one and a half.  That's a big, obvious clue to &#34;the problem&#34; right there.  In Broderick Crawford's episode &#34;The Blue Moon Train&#34; the end credits (and IMDB) list a small role simply called Hobo (as in hobo on a train).  That character simply doesn't exist on the available prints.  As to picture quality:  in a beautiful, distant-location exterior in &#34;Journey to a Hanging&#34; showing Whitman and others riding, a day-for-night filter (or similar visual adjustment) kicks in midway through the scene.  That is not intentional.  Wouldn't it be great if Whitman and Jill Townsend and Randy Boone, his surviving costars, and some of the guest stars and creator Christopher Knopf provided vital bonus track commentaries?!  Two guest stars (now deceased), who repeated their characters, were strong additions to the show IMO:  Andrew Duggan as (U.S. Army) Major Covington and Robert J. Wilke as rancher Hardy Miller.  Despite my expressed criticisms and reservations I will still buy &#34;Cimarron Strip.&#34;  And I hope you do too, and that an informed and appreciative commentary can evolve.",3,Running Times Abbreviated,1395187200,"03 19, 2014",2014,3081,"['One', 'favorites', 'finally', 'getting', 'official', 'DVD', 'treatment', 'everyone', 'legitimate', 'gripe', '/', 'complaint', 'will', 'surely', 'be', 'episodes', 'running', 'times', 'indicate', ""'ll"", 'be', 'viewing', 'cut-down', 'syndication', 'prints', 'Why', 'should', 'distributor', 'expect', 'consumers', 'pay', '70', 'USD', 'upwards', 'incomplete', 'episodes', 'same', 'versions', 'have', 'been', 'repeated', 'death', 'video', 'sound', 'quality', 'can', '34', 'hope', 'best.', '34', 'long-awaited-for', 'set', 'not', 'being', 're-mastered', 'released', 'CBS', 'who', 'provided', 'sharp-looking', '34', 'Gunsmoke', '34', '34', 'Rawhide', '34', '34', 'Have', 'Gun', 'Will', 'Travel', '34', 'DVD', 'sets', '75-minute', 'running', 'times', '90-minute', 'western', 'official', 'DVD', 'versions', '34', 'Virginian', '34', '1967-68', 'episodes', 'average', 'running', 'time', 'precious', '23', '34', 'Cimarron', 'Strip', '34', 'episodes', 'only', '70-and-a-half', 'minutes', '70.4', 'mins./ea.', 'same', 'length', 'were', 'when', 'when', 'Encore', 'Westerns', 'ran', 'not', 'CBS', '1967-68', 'few', 'minutes', 'short', 'series', 'star', 'Stuart', 'Whitman', 'rights', 'show', 'surely', 'instrumental', 'aspects', 'post', 'network', 'life', 'just', 'was', '47', 'years', 'ago', 'CBS', 'life', 'have', 'wonder', 'film', 'vaults', 'Hollywood', 'were', ""n't"", 'thoroughly', 'searched', 'missing', '34', 'trims', '34', 'order', 'be', 're-inserted', '35mm', 'masters', 'even', 'utilize', 'CBS', 'back-up', '16mm', 'prints', 'obtain', 'missing', 'minutes', 'verify', 'running', 'time', 'discrepancies', 'fortunately', 'possess', 'copy', 'episodes', 'timesheet', 'distributed', 'appropriate', 'parties', 'Silverbach-Lazarus', 'Group', 'company', 'one', 'time', 'possessed', 'syndication', 'rights', 'most', 'act', 'three', 'minutes', '34', 'black', '34', 'indicating', '/', 'specifying', 'local', 'stations', 'editors', 'how', 'many', 'minutes', 'seconds', 'commercials', 'promos', 'PSAs', 'IDs', 'could', 'be', 'inserted', 'break', '1960s', 'act', 'break', 'network', 'primetime', 'program', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'minute', 'most', 'one', 'half', 'big', 'obvious', 'clue', '34', 'problem', '34', 'right', 'there', 'Broderick', 'Crawford', 'episode', '34', 'Blue', 'Moon', 'Train', '34', 'end', 'credits', 'IMDB', 'list', 'small', 'role', 'simply', 'called', 'Hobo', 'hobo', 'train', 'character', 'simply', ""n't"", 'exist', 'available', 'prints', 'picture', 'quality', 'beautiful', 'distant-location', 'exterior', '34', 'Journey', 'Hanging', '34', 'showing', 'Whitman', 'others', 'riding', 'day-for-night', 'filter', 'similar', 'visual', 'adjustment', 'midway', 'scene', 'not', 'intentional', 'Would', ""n't"", 'be', 'great', 'Whitman', 'Jill', 'Townsend', 'Randy', 'Boone', 'surviving', 'costars', 'guest', 'stars', 'creator', 'Christopher', 'Knopf', 'provided', 'vital', 'bonus', 'track', 'commentaries', 'Two', 'guest', 'stars', 'now', 'deceased', 'who', 'repeated', 'characters', 'were', 'strong', 'additions', 'show', 'IMO', 'Andrew', 'Duggan', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'Major', 'Covington', 'Robert', 'J.', 'Wilke', 'rancher', 'Hardy', 'Miller', 'expressed', 'criticisms', 'reservations', 'will', 'still', 'buy', '34', 'Cimarron', 'Strip.', '34', 'hope', 'do', 'too', 'informed', 'appreciative', 'commentary', 'can', 'evolve']",Cimarron Strip - Complete Series
1694800,AZAEJB1ECT9HC,B00IS6WQ2S,Gary P. Cohen,"[46, 49]","Cimarron Strip started with one of my favorite tv openings.  A solitary rider rides quickly on his horse.  The camera comes in on him from very high and as we get close up we can see that it is the macho Stuart Whitman.  The camera turns around and goes way high again (probably a helicoptor shot) and we can see Whitman continue to ride alone, the vast expanse of prairie surrounding him on both sides.  This is accompanied by one of the great musical themes.So began Cimarron Strip, the third 90 minute western of the 1960s behind The Virginian and Wagon Train.  Stuart Whitman was great as Marshal Jim Crown, the only law for hundreds of miles.  The scripts were great with the usual great guest stars of the 1960s.  One of my favorite episodes was &#34;Knife in the Darkness,&#34; written by sci-fi legend, Harlan Ellison.  This episode takes place in one night and has Jack the Ripper finding his way into Cimarron.  He is accompanied by a freaky fog that rolls around throughout the entire episode.  What a great sense of atmosphere and suspense as Crown tries to figure out which of the strangers in town is Jack.  One of my favorite tv shows ever.The one weakness in the show is the supporting cast.  Crown's main deputy is the Scotsman, MacGregor played by British actor Percy Herbert.  Herbert appeared in many films and British tv shows during the '60s (including the Brando &#34;Mutiny on the Bounty.&#34;)  His MacGregor looks tough but is of no help to Crown at all.  He doesn't even carry a handgun, using a rifle instead.  Crown's other deputy is the wussy Francis, played by Randy Boone, just coming off of The Virginian.  The only female of the show, Dulcey is a young woman, played by British actress Jill Townsend, who has inherited the restaurant next to Crown's jail.  She is a much younger woman than Whitman and her character has an obvious crush on him despite the fact that he treats her like a little sister.  The supporting actors and characters on this series could have been stronger.This was a large scale and obviously expensive western.  It ran on CBS Thursday nights from 7:30-9:00PM from 1967-1968.  It did not do well against Ironside on NBC and was cancelled.  It was replaced in 1968 by a new police series called Hawaii Five-O. (I'm sure you've heard of it.)If you want to see an excellent but not very well-remembered western, you should pick this set up.

1694802,AD50CYPEWH6NN,B00IS6WQ2S,Jon Wynne,"[3, 3]","The strip of land known as the Cimarron Territory and later the Oklahoma Panhandle, left virtually ungoverned for decades in the 1800s, is the perfect place to set a good, old-fashioned Western. Edna Ferber set her epic, sprawling novel CIMARRON in this area of the United States and the resultant film adaptation in 1930 starring Richard Dix was the first Western to win an Academy Award for Best Picture. It was re-made in 1960 with Glenn Ford, a few years after the first TV series with Cimarron in the title: Cimarron City, starring George Montgomery.By the time CIMARRON STRIP came along, TV Westerns were at their apex, with some shows, like Gunsmoke, running for over a decade by 1967, when CIMARRON STRIP was produced. Speaking of Gunsmoke, a number of the creative minds behind that still remarkable program were involved in the production of this new, &#34;90-minute&#34; Western. It looked like a sure hit.The budgets were big, and according to star Stuart Whitman (in a terrific extra feature bonus interview included in this collection) top dollar was paid to get the best talent. A look at this partial list of guest stars during the show's 23 episode run attests to this fact: Richard Boone, Beau Bridges, David Carradine, Seymour Cassel, Joseph Cotten, Broderick Crawford, Royal Dano, Robert Duvall, Steve Forrest, Victor French, Mariette Hartley, Robert Lansing, Darren McGavin, Leslie Nielsen, Warren Oates, Slim Pickens, Suzanne Pleshette, Denver Pyle, Telly Savalas, John Saxon, Tom Skerritt, Jon Voight, Tuesday Weld, Robert Wilke, Morgan Woodward and more!Stunning symphonic theme music reinforces this promise of quality. Composed by nine time Oscar nominee (he won thrice) Maurice Jarre, the sweeping score propels a hard riding Stuart Whitman over the opening and closing credits. It's a classic opening and screams &#34;BIG! BIG!&#34;The supporting cast, though not in the same league as the supporting roles on Gunsmoke, are all very good, with Percy Herbert in particular adding some colour as Scotsman MacGregor. One almost expects him to say &#34;she canna hold much longer, Marshal!&#34; much like another volatile, fictional Scotsman on the small screen at this time, Canadian actor James Doohan's &#34;Scotty&#34; on Star Trek. Herbert's MacGregor is a vivid contrast to Whitman's usually calm Marshal Jim Crown. Randy Boone, as sometimes gullible but always sincere Francis Wilde, was fresh off of television's first 90-minute Western, The Virginian. Given another season, his character might've matured into a stronger, more reliable deputy, instead of the one who always wound up getting caught and handing over the keys to the jail cell to the bad guys. Jill Townsend, too, as Dulcie Coopersmith, fought hard to make her character into more than a one-dimensional virgin who nurses an unrequited love for Marshal Crown. She is lovely and her caring nature is more than just innocence--she is genuinely compassionate.So why did CIMARRON STRIP only last one season? Probably just timing. A clue is to be found, again in the interview with Stuart Whitman, when he divulges that one of the CIMARRON STRIP creators, Leonard Freeman, presented Whitman with a new pilot script he had written called Hawaii 5-0. Freeman strongly encouraged Whitman to walk away from his commitment to his CIMARRON STRIP company, predicting that times were changing and it was now the dawn of the era of the detective show. Whitman, to his credit, said no and stuck to his guns (in this case, a .45 calibre nickel-plated seven inch barrel revolver). Whitman had a one third producing interest in CIMARRON STRIP and really wanted it to succeed. He apparently loved doing the show, too. But, alas, Freeman was right, and CIMARRON STRIP was cancelled after 23 episodes (filmed over an incredibly tight 11 month period).Rather than lament what could have been, it's time to celebrate the proper DVD release of this terrific, albeit short-lived, series. Nitpickers may point and say that the episodes have been tampered with (some slight editing is noticeable in places) but given the age of the shows and their previous limited availability, this is a minor point of contention. Only one episode jarred in this way, with the climactic shoot-out being momentarily compromised by a bad edit.Overall, the picture quality and sound balance is excellent and, of great importance to more and more viewers of classic programs, closed captioning/subtitles is an option. Beautifully packaged on 8 discs, CIMARRON STRIP is a must-have for collectors of classic TV Westerns.A handful of episodes are a little sub-par, story-wise, but this is more than compensated for by the balance of the episodes which range between very good and excellent. Arguably the stand out is Knife in the Darkness, a take on Jack the Ripper which is so rich in atmosphere you can almost taste the fog. Written by Harlan Ellison, known particularly for his contributions to the Science Fiction genre, This show really packs a wallop and demonstrates how far the producers were willing to go to breathe new life into the serial Western.In stark contrast to the heightened drama of this episode are the delightful touches of humour that manifest now and then. Early in the series, while Marshal Crown is attempting to take a much-deserved bath, some bad guys ride through town, stirring up trouble. Whitman, wearing only a bath towel (!) grabs his .45 and jumps out the window and down onto the street, battling with the badmen until they are subdued. The towel, which in reality would have had to have been surgically attached in order to not fall off, adds an hilarious counterpoint to the violence of the scene. It almost seems a subtle acknowledgement of all those fight scenes involving Marshal Dillon on Gunsmoke in which his hat never falls off. Given the earlier mentioned creative connection to Gunsmoke, this is entirely possible!Again going back to Stuart Whitman, he says in his interview that rather than listen to him talk about the series, fans should just watch the episodes. He seems genuinely excited at the prospect of so many people rediscovering CIMARRON STRIP, a show that obviously meant a great deal to him. It's easy to understand why. Marshal Jim Crown is multi-faceted, often behaving in ways that are entirely unexpected, especially when in a tight spot. Yet he never compromises his integrity as a Western hero deserving of our esteem.CIMARRON STRIP is an outstanding series. It took awhile to make its way onto DVD, but now that it is here it is just waiting to be enjoyed.",5,"Ride on, Stuart!",1403913600,"06 28, 2014",2014,6574,"['strip', 'land', 'known', 'Cimarron',

1694803,AILAB4OYB6HNI,B00IS6WQ2S,KoneFire,"[3, 4]","Although I would've of loved to have left a five rating, on this DVD set itself I could not, and I will say why in a minute.  I waited sometime on pre-order to get this show. LIke many others DVD sets that have come out, in the past it's essentially issues with the sets, not the issue with the show itself. if I were rating  the show itself of course it's a five all the way....Or I would not of purchased it, and I love Stuart Whitman and always have. I like his voice and facial expressions especially with his eyes, and his swagger while he walks, it's like (okay go ahead and try and run one by me, but it won't work attitude)!!!!Also, he has played in many many roles, I enjoyed. Just side stepping for a moment. Another role that stood out with me about Whitman that I enjoyed was the move ""Convicts Four"" (1962) where he portrayed a prison guard and then was promoted to a Warden where he portrayed those same characteristics, especially when he became the Warden to and focused on one inmate in particular. He played pretty much opposite to Ben Gazzara whom I also like, and was a fine actor (Gazzara was the convict, based on a true story). Also Broad Crawford whom I also like was in a short stint of that movie, along with many other great stars. I'm not into allot of westerns, unless there is Human interest behind it. I'm not just looking for a bang bang shoot um up.Going back to CS Whitman could've held the show himself with just the weekly guest stars. However to be fair, I do believe if maybe they would've had more of a storyline centered  around  his co-stars from time to time, it would of brought  them out more. I wanted something more with the Dulcey character in it. Although I just received the set last week. The first episode I viewed was the one with Broad Crawford in ""Blue Moon Train"" ( it was ironic watching Whitman play opposite Crawford, as more of a hauncho, unlike in the early days of Crawford's TV series Highway Patrol where Whitman a patrol man was under Crawford that came and went). However, another one of my favorites thus far from CS was ""Heller""with Tuesday Weld ( I saw that on TV a few years ago). I recall thinking that I wish this show would come out on DVD finally. I had not watched some them since I was a kid.  The other episode I also liked thus far was ""Big Jessie"" with Mariette Hartley, that  had allot of good twists and turns to it, and a good storyline with human interests characters as well. What is ironic about Heller and Big Jessie, is as the viewer, it makes me wonder what is up with Crown. You know the women liked him, but was it the other way around?I also took the liberty of watching the commentary with Whitman which is located on Disc 8, since nobody was asking questions of him, he was just talking about the show, and gave some insights for the making of it. I was hoping, that he would have given the audience a bit more insight of what was going on behind the set. It's makes it more interesting, however, there was some goodies in it, that I think the viewers will like. (It is not that long).Now to the issues: The biggest issue from what I have viewd was the issue with the quality, of the sound but more so with the picture as many other reviewers mentioned, it looked equal to a Made For Demand DVD's. I was disappointed that they did not edit, the quality of the picture like it could've of been, especially for what Amazon is charging. I used a BluRay, which would enhance any issues more then a regular DVD player. Granted it's a dated show. However, I viewed and owned shows older then this and they were remastered and edited very well. Shows in color were not out that long in the 60's, so I understand that some of the colors are not as natural as they are today. (If you were privy to own or have access to a color TV set in that era). With the older shows I actually prefer the shows in black and white. However, I do agree with other reviewers, that when CBS edits they do a heck of a job, on their shows whether it's color or black and white. They are simply flawless, so if the consumer pays a bit more, then it's worth it. I just chalked it up that it was a cheaper company.I didn't notice the time cut in the shows, that other reviewers mentioned. Obviously due to commercials they are not going to run 90 minutes. I figured about 75 or 80 min. As I stated in the aforementioned a few years ago while watching it on television re-runs, the length was the about the same that was provided to us on DVD. However, compared to the amount of commercials they have on television today, for a 90 min show this is like heaven. If there was something missing, it didn't alter the storyline for me. I do not have equipment to check to see how long the show is actually running.There were two minor issues that bothered me a little. One was the issue of the Air dates of the show. For example, the pilot/first show ""Battleground"" was not on the first disc nor listed as a first show, but instead it was on disc two as the 2nd episode. Some of the other shows were out of Air date order also. However, I don't watch them like that, but I know others that do. I only noticed it because they had the production numbers on the shows on what order they were aired, because they had a full complete episode guide that I was very happy about.  Other sets if they even have one it's just the, air date and description, however, they went a bit further and listed all the guest stars. As on many sets the viewer has to hunt through the actual DVD  to find that guest star which drives me nuts. I like to see who is in the show, and go right into it. The last issue is they put the disc holder in upside down. I could take it out, but I might break it. So when I close the dust cover everything is upside down.All in all I'm still glad to have Cimarron Strip in my DVD collection, and I can't wait to view all 23 shows. Again, they are not easy to obtain. If I known that Whitman was selling  them online as somebody mentioned, then I would of bought it there a few years back. However, if you love this show I would still highly recommend this. So I assign this DVD set four stars...........",4,WELCOME BACK CIMARRON STRIP!!!!,1401408000,"05 30, 2014",2014,6173,"['would', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'have', 'left', 'five', 'rating', 'DVD', 'set',

1694806,A3E3HHHYYX4AMS,B00IS6WQ2S,Mike,"[1, 1]","A good solid western starring Stuart Whitman as Marshall Jim Crown. It also starred Percy Herbert as MacGregor a cantankerous Scottish saloon owner, Jill Townsend as Dulcey an English rose who comes to find her father and stays taking over the saloon and turning it into an inn and Randy Boone from ""The Virginian"" as Francis a freelance reporter.Quite a lot of well known faces appear in this show like:John Saxon ( Enter the Dragon)Telly Savalas (Kojak)David Carradine (Kung Fu)Richard Boone (Have Gun will Travel)Joseph Cotton (Citizen Kane)Leslie Neilson (The Naked Gun)James Stacy (Lancer)Tuesday Weld (Bonnie and Clyde)Broderick Crawford (Highway Patrol)Jon Voight (Midnight Cowboy)This series only lasted one season but deserved to run for longer.Great production values are evident from the beginning to the end. I believe this was the only series Stuart Whitman did.Although he did appear in movies and guest starred in order TV shows.I thought this show was cancelled because we already had a marshal in Gunsmoke but it seems that there was another reason. On this DVD set the bonus feature is an interview with Stuart Whitman which was all too short for my liking.Here he explains why the show was cancelled. It seems the producer was Leonard Freeman and he was producing another series for TV called ""Hawaii Five O"" with Stuart Whitman in mind for the part of Steve McGarrett. I had heard that Jack Lord was not the actor who was originally intended for the role but was brought in at the last minute to everyone's surprise. Now I know who that actor was.So Cimarron Strip was cancelled in favor of Five O and the rest is history.Still, this is a fine western and below are some of my favourite episodes:THE HUNTED: Two outlaw bothers turn themselves in to Marshal Crown for a fair trial but a wealthy cattleman who's son was killed hires two bounty hunters to kill them.THE DEPUTY: A man hires on as Marshal Crown's deputy in order to exact revenge on his cohorts who left him for dead after a robbery went wrong.KNIFE IN THE DARKNESS: A killer is on the loose with two women mutilated.Could this be the work of Jack the Ripper?THE GREENERS: Marshal Crown tries to convince a family to testify in a case where they saw the lynching of two derelicts.WHITEY: A vengeance crazed outlaw plans to get even with the gang who double-crossed him. He takes Dulcey hostage but begins to fall in love with her.She also starts to have feelings for him.Will he go through with his plan and will he make it out alive?",5,The Marshal of Cimarron,1404950400,"07 10, 2014",2014,2516,"['good', 'solid', 'western', 'starring', 'Stuart', 'Whitman', 'Marshall', 'Jim', 'Crown', 'also', 'starred', 'Percy', 'Herbert', 'MacGregor', 'cantankerous', 'Scottish', 'saloon', 'owner', 'Jill', 'Townsend', 'Dulcey', 'English', 'rose', 'who', 'find', 'father', 'stays', 'taking', 'saloon', 'turning', 'inn', 'Randy', 'Boone', 'Virginian', 'Francis', 'freelance', 'reporter.Quite', 'lot', 'well', 'known', 'appear', 'show', 'John', 'Saxon', 'Enter', 'Dragon', 'Telly', 'Savalas', 'Kojak', 'David', 'Carradine', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Richard', 'Boone', 'Have', 'Gun', 'will', 'Travel', 'Joseph', 'Cotton', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'Leslie', 'Neilson', 'Naked', 'Gun', 'James', 'Stacy', 'Lancer', 'Tuesday', 'Weld', 'Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'Broderick', 'Crawford', 'Highway', 'Patrol', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'Midnight', 'Cowboy', 'series', 'only', 'lasted', 'one', 'season', 'deserved', 'run', 'longer.Great', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'evident', 'beginning', 'end', 'believe', 'was', 'only', 'series', 'Stuart', 'Whitman', 'did', 'appear', 'movies', 'guest', 'starred', 'order', 'TV', 'shows.I', 'thought', 'show', 'was', 'cancelled', 'already', 'had', 'marshal', 'Gunsmoke', 'was', 'reason', 'DVD', 'set', 'bonus', 'feature', 'interview', 'Stuart', 'Whitman', 'was', 'too', 'short', 'liking.Here', 'why', 'show', 'was', 'cancelled', 'producer', 'was', 'Leonard', 'Freeman', 'was', 'producing', 'series', 'TV', 'called', 'Hawaii', 'Five', 'O', 'Stuart', 'Whitman', 'mind', 'part', 'Steve', 'McGarrett', 'had', 'heard', 'Jack', 'Lord', 'was', 'not', 'actor', 'who', 'was', 'originally', 'intended', 'role', 'was', 'brought', 'last', 'minute', 'everyone', 'surprise', 'Now', 'know', 'who', 'actor', 'was.So', 'Cimarron', 'Strip', 'was', 'cancelled', 'favor', 'Five', 'O', 'rest', 'history.Still', 'fine', 'western', 'below', 'are', 'favourite', 'episodes', 'HUNTED', 'Two', 'outlaw', 'bothers', 'turn', 'Marshal', 'Crown', 'fair', 'trial', 'wealthy', 'cattleman', 'who', 'son', 'was', 'killed', 'hires', 'two', 'bounty', 'hunters', 'kill', 'them.THE', 'DEPUTY', 'man', 'Marshal', 'Crown', 'deputy', 'order', 'exact', 'revenge', 'cohorts', 'who', 'left', 'dead', 'robbery', 'went', 'wrong.KNIFE', 'IN', 'THE', 'DARKNESS', 'killer', 'loose', 'two', 'women', 'mutilated.Could', 'be', 'work', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'THE', 'GREENERS', 'Marshal', 'Crown', 'convince', 'family', 'testify', 'case', 'where', 'saw', 'lynching', 'two', 'derelicts.WHITEY', 'vengeance', 'crazed', 'outlaw', 'plans', 'get', 'even', 'gang', 'who', 'double-crossed', 'Dulcey', 'hostage', 'fall', 'love', 'her.She', 'also', 'have', 'feelings', 'him.Will', 'plan', 'will', 'make', 'out', 'alive']",Cimarron Strip - Complete Series
1694807,A30YTPOSMT12C5,B00IS6WQ2S,Mulroon,"[19, 22]","It ran for 23 episodes during 1967-68 and was CBS's response to ABC's 7th season of hour and a half Wagon Trains and NBC's long running The Virginian (1962-71). Like Gunsmoke, Cimarron Strip is the story of a United States Marshall (and friends) trying to keep the west crime free. Both programs were produced at CBS Studio City and have a similar look, right down to faded film and murky color. I expect CBS will remaster the elements of the color Gunsmokes, as they have with earlier seasons, when they release them to DVD; Cimarron Strip is in desperate need of restoration too. The stories themselves are great, including one written by Harlan Ellison about a beast that slaughters men and cattle alike, and the guest stars and direction are top notch (again, utilizing talent from the same pool as Gunsmoke).

Production values are strong, though many of the stories seem overly padded and would have worked better in a one-hour format. It's fun to see such an impressive roster of familiar faces in the cast.Guest stars included Beau Bridges, David Carradine, Joseph Cotten, Robert Duvall, Mariette Hartley, Darren McGavin, Leslie Nielsen, Suzanne Pleshette, Telly Savalas, John Saxon, Jon Voight, and Tuesday Weld.All 23 episodes are included in an 8-disc DVD set.

After the disappointing cancellation of this high calibre series, Whitman thereafter looked out of place out of the saddle and in the modern city (at least to me), whether it was under the sea (Irwin Allen's ""City Beneath The Sea"") or on dry land. Indeed he seemed so ideal for the part of Marshal Crown that it was almost as if he had been snatched up from the 1880s for real. It broke my heart when we had to (seemingly) give him back to the ages. I was fifteen when this gritty but realistic series was cancelled and replaced by Hawaii Five-O. It would be the only time I ever wrote a protest letter to a network to save a series from cancellation, but of course, it was to no avail. The public was tiring of the western genre, but this one spared no expense, what with location shooting in and around the Alabama Hills, Bishop, and Kanab, and of course, the opening credits shot on a high clearing (thankfully still unspoiled to this day) just a hundred or so yards north of Thundercloud Lane, Lone Pine, California (before you get to Tuttle Creek Road) beneath a snow-capped Mount Whitney, and to the accompaniment of Academy Award winner, Maurice Jarre's exhilarating score. Gunsmoke was a great western, but I never could get used to Dodge City being indoors on a soundstage, what with 'the sun' casting five shadows from the feet of people in the street. Cimarron seemed to have more realism and grit.As for the quality of the DVD transfers, there is much room for improvement, providing well preserved negatives still lie in the vaults. The audio is just passable, as is the video, whereby there is quite a bit of fluctuation in color timing in some episodes, most prominently during dissolves when there's a sudden shift to a green tint. In other instances transitions are somewhat choppy, as if a few frames were cut, but I'm so glad to have a hard copy of this marvelous program, I can ignore it. I suppose little effort was made towards restoration due to limited public interest, not that Cimarron Strip is undeserving of such an endeavor. I just hope pristine negatives exist so that this program can once again be seen in all its glory, and I would also hope that this is accomplished before it's too late and the original negatives are lost to deterioration. I maintained five stars because this may be as good as it gets, considering the age of these prints. The running time of the first episode clocked in at nearly 73 minutes, which means, after commercials, that very little, if any program content is missing (it was in a 90 minute time slot).",5,"""I always wanted to be a cowboy"" (Stuart Whitman accepting the Silver Spur Award)",1400284800,"05 17, 2014",2014,2603,"['Well', 'got', 'wish', 'Mr.', 'Whitman', 'disappointing', 'cancellation', 'high', 'calibre', 'series', 'Whitman', 'thereafter', 'looked', 'place', 'saddle', 'modern', 'city', 'least', 'was', 'sea', 'Irwin', 'Allen', 'City', 'Beneath', 'Sea', 'dry', 'land', 'Indeed', 'seemed', 'so', 'ideal', 'part', 'Marshal', 'Crown', 'was', 'almost', 'had', 'been', 'snatched', 'up', '1880s', 'real', 'broke', 'heart', 'when', 'had', 'seemingly', 'give', 'back', 'ages', 'was', 'fifteen', 'when', 'gritty', 'realistic', 'series', 'was', 'cancelled', 'replaced', 'Hawaii', 'Five-O', 'would', 'be', 'only', 'time', 'ever', 'wrote', 'protest', 'letter', 'network', 'save', 'series', 'cancellation', 'course', 'was', 'avail', 'public', 'was', 'tiring', 'western', 'genre', 'one', 'spared', 'expense', 'what', 'location', 'shooting', 'Alabama', 'Hills', 'Bishop', 'Kanab', 'course', 'opening', 'credits', 'shot', 'high', 'clearing', 'thankfully', 'still', 'unspoiled', 'day', 'just', 'hundred', 'so', 'yards', 'north', 'Thundercloud', 'Lane', 'Lone', 'Pine', 'California', 'get', 'Tuttle', 'Creek', 'Road', 'beneath', 'snow-capped', 'Mount', 'Whitney', 'accompaniment', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winner', 'Maurice', 'Jarre', 'exhilarating', 'score', 'Gunsmoke', 'was', 'great', 'western', 'never', 'could', 'get', 'used', 'Dodge', 'City', 'being', 'indoors', 'soundstage', 'what', ""'the"", 'sun', 'casting', 'five', 'shadows', 'feet', 'people', 'street', 'Cimarron', 'seemed', 'have', 'more', 'realism', 'grit.As', 'quality', 'DVD', 'transfers', 'much', 'room', 'improvement', 'providing', 'well', 'preserved', 'negatives', 'still', 'lie', 'vaults', 'audio', 'just', 'passable', 'video', 'whereby', 'quite', 'bit', 'fluctuation', 'color', 'timing', 'episodes', 'most', 'prominently', 'dissolves', 'when', 'sudden', 'shift', 'green', 'tint', 'other', 'instances', 'transitions', 'are', 'somewhat', 'choppy', 'few', 'frames', 'were', 'cut', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'have', 'hard', 'copy', 'marvelous', 'program', 'can', 'ignore', 'suppose', 'little', 'effort', 'was', 'made', 'towards', 'restoration', 'due', 'limited', 'public', 'interest', 'not', 'Cimarron', 'Strip', 'undeserving', 'such', 'endeavor', 'just', 'hope', 'pristine', 'negatives', 'exist', 'so', 'program', 'can', 'once', 'again', 'be', 'seen', 'glory', 'would', 'also', 'hope', 'accomplished', 'too', 'late', 'original', 'negatives', 'are', 'lost', 'deterioration', 'maintained', 'five', 'stars', 'may', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'considering', 'age', 'prints', 'running', 'time', 'first', 'episode', 'clocked', 'nearly', '73', 'minutes', 'commercials', 'very', 'little', 'program', 'content', 'missing', 'was', '90', 'minute', 'time', 'slot']",Cimarron Strip - Complete Series
