Definitely not what you think it's going to be, Jug Face is quite different from anything that been released in a while. Backwoods life for a group of families centers around The Pit which demands sacrifice and offers care in return. It's honestly hard to tell if The Pit took control over these families in service of itself or if they gave The Pit the power to wield over them. End result is the same, a Shirley Jackson like society built around who's next and what happens when one of them resists? Some very twisted plot elements, but the cast makes them fit in the context of the story (and making them fit is scary in and of itself).

1659705,A1JZZLIVXGJSIB,B00DNJ95DS,CinemaMinor,"[1, 2]","I struggled with whether to give this movie 2 or 3 stars because unlike other reviewers, I thought the acting was quite good.  Instead, I thought it was the tone that was off, and there&#8217;s also the problem of the movie never committing to what it wants to be.  While I was watching it, I felt that there was something very M. Knight Shyamalan&#8217;s &#8220;The Village&#8221; about it, and kept on expecting some twist that would explain all of the oddness onscreen.  But ultimately, what I was seeing was what I was getting -- and it was kind of a gratuitous mess -- which is why I went with 2 stars.The main character, Ada, is a teenage girl who lives in a backwoods community with her family and other families who worship a pit, which is literally a mud hole the likes of which is created when a giant tree is uprooted.  The pit demands human sacrifices and in exchange, safeguards the people in the community from other tragedies, like fatal disease.  The pit channels its demands through the hands of a potter who, in a trance-like state, crafts jugs in the image of the individual whom the pit wants next -- hence the term &#8220;Jug Face.&#8221;  Despite the fact that any of them could be rendered unto the pit at any moment, the members of the community seem pretty content with this arrangement.Except for Ada.  When she has a premonition that she is next, she sneaks a peak at the potter&#8217;s latest jug, confirms her fears, and unprepared to die, hides it in the woods.  The pit is angered and a bloodbath ensues.  The gore in the movie is pretty gory, between the human sacrifices and people being torn to shreds by the angry pit.  I would categorize the movie as more violent than scary.There are elements of the horror genre in the movie -- perhaps too many elements, and they never gel.  There&#8217;s a cult aspect.  There&#8217;s the human sacrifice aspect, which very much reminds me of the famous short story &#8220;The Lottery.&#8221;  There&#8217;s a witch hunt aspect.  And then for something completely different, there&#8217;s a strange &#8220;Wizard of Oz&#8221; aspect surrounding Ada&#8217;s burgeoning womanhood and her struggle with making her home in a world that has so little to offer her.Then there are the anachronisms.  Ada&#8217;s community has cars and refrigerators, but they wash their clothes in a creek and wear the same outfits every day, most of which could&#8217;ve been taken off the set of &#8220;Little House on the Prairie.&#8221;  They make their living selling moonshine which they store in more handmade jugs.  The juxtaposition of the backwards, backwoods community and the modern town just outside of it serves to create a creepy, isolated atmosphere, but there&#8217;s no explanation for how or why these people exist in this situation.  There&#8217;s some barely coherent background given through the character of Ada&#8217;s grandfather, who is senile and mute, but it&#8217;s not enough to support why these people live the way they do, other than the fact that they keep stating it&#8217;s worked well for them for a while.  But how has it worked?  Not only does it seem that the community isn&#8217;t large enough to perpetuate itself, why isn&#8217;t child protective services poking around asking why the kids aren&#8217;t in school?  How is the disappearance of so many individuals by sacrifice overlooked by the mainstream authorities?  It&#8217;s not like this is a secret community &#8211; although it&#8217;s drawn to seem like one, and it just doesn&#8217;t work.At its core, the story revolves around whether Ada will escape and allow everyone to die, or make up for her betrayal.  She also needs to deal with the fact that she&#8217;s pregnant -- the excuse she uses for not wanting to die.  And the fact that she is promised to be&#8221; joined&#8221; to men in the community (another ridiculously old-fashioned trope), contingent upon her purity.  There are graphic scenes involving incest and sexuality in the movie; it is for adults only.Again, I appreciated the acting, including Sean Young as Ada&#8217;s mother, but there is no pay-off.  The movie goes nowhere.  Instead, it left me searching for some deeper meaning that I can&#8217;t find.",2,Interesting&#8230;but it doesn&#8217;t know what it wants to be and there&#8217;s no pay-off,1384560000,"11 16, 2013",2013,4228,"['struggled', 'give', 'movie', '2', '3', 'stars', 'other', 'reviewers', 'thought', 'acting', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'Instead', 'thought', 'was', 'tone', 'was', 'off', 'there', '8217', 's', 'also', 'problem', 'movie', 'never', 'committing', 'what', 'be', 'was', 'watching', 'felt', 'was', 'something', 'very', 'M.', 'Knight', 'Shyamalan', '8217', '8220', 'Village', '8221', 'kept', 'expecting', 'twist', 'would', 'explain', 'oddness', 'onscreen', 'ultimately', 'what', 'was', 'seeing', 'was', 'what', 'was', 'getting', 'was', 'kind', 'gratuitous', 'mess', 'why', 'went', '2', 'stars.The', 'main', 'character', 'Ada', 'teenage', 'girl', 'who', 'backwoods', 'community', 'family', 'other', 'families', 'who', 'worship', 'pit', 'literally', 'mud', 'hole', 'likes', 'created', 'when', 'giant', 'tree', 'uprooted', 'pit', 'human', 'sacrifices', 'exchange', 'safeguards', 'people', 'community', 'other', 'tragedies', 'fatal', 'disease', 'pit', 'demands', 'hands', 'potter', 'who', 'trance-like', 'state', 'crafts', 'jugs', 'image', 'individual', 'whom', 'pit', 'next', 'hence', 'term', '8220', 'Jug', 'Face.', '8221', 'fact', 'could', 'be', 'rendered', 'pit', 'moment', 'members', 'community', 'seem', 'pretty', 'content', 'arrangement.Except', 'Ada', 'When', 'premonition', 'next', 'peak', 'potter', '8217', 'latest', 'jug', 'fears', 'unprepared', 'die', 'woods', 'pit', 'angered', 'bloodbath', 'ensues', 'gore', 'movie', 'pretty', 'gory', 'human', 'sacrifices', 'people', 'being', 'torn', 'shreds', 'angry', 'pit', 'would', 'categorize', 'movie', 'more', 'violent', 'are', 'elements', 'horror', 'genre', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'too', 'many', 'elements', 'never', 'gel', '8217', 's', 'cult', 'aspect', '8217', 's', 'human', 'sacrifice', 'aspect', 'very', 'much', 'reminds', 'famous', 'short', 'story', '8220', 'Lottery.', '8221', '8217', 's', 'witch', 'hunt', 'aspect', 'then', 'something', 'completely', 'different', '8217', 's', 'strange', '8220', 'Wizard', 'Oz', '8221', 'aspect', 'surrounding', 'Ada', '8217', 'burgeoning', 'womanhood', 'struggle', 'making', 'home', 'world', 'so', 'little', 'offer', 'her.Then', 'are', 'anachronisms', 'Ada', '8217', 's', 'community', 'cars', 'refrigerators', 'wash', 'clothes', 'creek', 'wear', 'same', 'outfits', 'day', 'most', 'could', '8217', 'been', 'taken', 'off', 'set', '8220', 'Little', 'House', 'Prairie.', '8221', 'make', 'living', 'selling', 'moonshine', 'store', 'more', 'handmade', 'jugs', 'juxtaposition', 'backwards', 'backwoods', 'community', 'modern', 'town', 'just', 'create', 'creepy', 'isolated', 'atmosphere', 'there', '8217', 'explanation', 'how', 'why', 'people', 'exist', 'situation', '8217', 'barely', 'coherent', 'background', 'given', 'character', 'Ada', '8217', 'grandfather', 'who', 'senile', 'mute', '8217', 'not', 'enough', 'support', 'why', 'people', 'live', 'way', 'do', 'other', 'fact', 'keep', 'stating', '8217', 's', 'worked', 'well', 'while', 'how', 'worked', 'Not', 'only', 'seem', 'community', 'isn', '8217', 'large', 'enough', 'perpetuate', 'why', 'isn', '8217', 'child', 'protective', 'services', 'poking', 'around', 'asking', 'why', 'kids', 'aren', '8217', 't', 'school', 'How', 'disappearance', 'so', 'many', 'individuals', 'sacrifice', 'overlooked', 'mainstream', 'authorities', '8217', 'not', 'secret', 'community', '8211', '8217', 'drawn', 'seem', 'one', 'just', 'doesn', '8217', 'work.At', 'core', 'story', 'Ada', 'will', 'escape', 'allow', 'everyone', 'die', 'make', 'up', 'betrayal', 'also', 'deal', 'fact', '8217', 'pregnant', 'excuse', 'not', 'wanting', 'die', 'fact', 'promised', 'be', '8221', 'joined', '8221', 'men', 'community', 'ridiculously', 'old-fashioned', 'trope', 'contingent', 'purity', 'are', 'graphic', 'scenes', 'involving', 'incest', 'sexuality', 'movie', 'adults', 'only.Again', 'appreciated', 'acting', 'including', 'Sean', 'Young', 'Ada', '8217', 'mother', 'pay-off', 'movie', 'nowhere', 'Instead', 'left', 'searching', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'can', '8217', 't', 'find']",Jug Face

And its free on prime. Cool! I would really give it a 3.5 stars- its more than just OK, but if I give it a 4, then my real 4s would be watered down. Its a well done flick, no complaints in any department: visual, auditory, acting, direction, story, dialogue, etc. The meaning of it all is slowly unravelled, which kept it interesting. Like, what's with the jugs? And what's the pit about? The characters were rural, backwoods types. Not very well developed but its not that kind of movie. The pacing was fine. I didn't feel like it lagged. The reason why it doesn't score higher on my meter is because I really didn't care too much. It didn't hook me, let alone grip me. Now, I also didn't watch it during primetime hours, which is important. I was multitasking, so.... perhaps I would've felt disappointed if I had sat down to watch it with the intention of really getting into it. Again, nothing really wrong with it. It was just not &#34;enough&#34; for my tastes: dark enough, intense enough, trippy enough, interesting enough, and it didn't really tap into any of my favorite themes in horror.

I guess it would technically be called a horror film, but it&#8217;s also a domestic drama.2. The movie is really low-budget, and the acting is uneven. But it&#8217;s a tight, well-paced, atmospheric indie film.3. It&#8217;s about a small group of backwoods families. They are ignorant, abusive, incestuous rednecks that live off of moonshine and roadkill.4. They also worship some ancient thing that lives in a pit in the forest. It needs sacrifices.5. One family member is a mentally slow young man gets messages from the pit about who is to be sacrificed next. A girl discovers she&#8217;s been chosen, and tries to get out of it.6. The pit isn&#8217;t happy with the girl&#8217;s refusal, and starts retaliating against the families.7. This could have been a really cheesy movie &#8211; it&#8217;s hard to explain the story with a straight face. But the script is very well done; it dares to play the story straight and you just go with it.8. There is not a lot of violence, so when it does happen, it grabs your attention.9. This movie could be considered a commentary on blind devotion, cults, and religion.

Ar 81 minutes, the log line on IMDB reads: Jug Face tells the story of a pregnant teen trying to escape a backwoods community when she discovers that she may be sacrificed to a creature in a pit.The movie features Lauren Ashley Carter as Ada where close-knit families of moonshiners live to serve a pit deep in the woods. A potter creates jug with a face that resembles people within the community. The person &#34;featured&#34; must be sacrificed over an open, living pit filled with what looks like blood. A ghost-child is the speaker for the dead. When Ada discovers the newest made jug, it is her face depicted, her face looking back at her.Although betrothed, Ada is pregnant with another's child. She does not want to be the next Jug Face sacrifice, so she steals and hides the potted jug. Her actions cause a disruption in order. The ghost-child is not happy, nor is the community as more and more people needlessly die. In an attempt to right wrongs and stop needless sacrifices, Ada and the potter try to fix all that went wrong.This is a horror movie pure and simple. Frightening and gritty. It will not make you scream. Or jump. It will give you chills and perhaps have you sleep with the lights on.The cast is made up of lesser known name actors and actresses that are talented and believable. Carter is an amazing Ada. If you are looking for a compelling tale, filled with blood and the stuff urban legends are made of, then I recommend Jug Face.

It was suspenseful and shocking, but to me it was more of a study on a group of people who developed a misplaced trust on a object that was deemed to contain answers affecting life or death.  That is all I am going to say about that, since I don't want to ruin the whole plot.The only gripe I had about it, was that it seemed to play into a stereotyping of Southern Hill type mountain people.

1659768,A3PHT3YPWEA78,B00DNJ95DS,www.horrortrunk.com,"[0, 2]","Jug Face follows the story of a young pregnant girl (Ada), who is trying to escape the clutches of her isolated community. A community set in the middle of the woods, where their lives are guided by the supernatural presence of a pit. Ada discovers that she is the next sacrifice and must escape before it is too late.A supernatural horror of the control and dictatorship a pit has over a small isolated community. To please the pit they must make human sacrifices of whoever the pit requires. Those chosen are communicated through the possession of Dawai, who creates the face of the next sacrifice onto a jug (hence the masterful title). The authenticity of the mystical pit is not the centre of this story, but instead the results created by an evil force left free to reign over a helpless community.Although the story sounds weak the director initially manages to create a film with potential; nostalgic of the cult and extremist films of the 70's. The style of filming is pretty generic as it seems that the director has no focus on what the film is trying to say, so the camera keeps distance favouring long and medium shots, allowing the story to unfold freely within the frame. Close ups and rapid editing is used in moments of 'white eyed' possession...Jug Face can be described as a drama more than a horror, there are graphic scenes of sacrifices with entrails and body parts to keep the gore hunters happy, but the film exhausts the plight that Ada faces and the inescapable fate of those chosen by the pit. Jug Face explores a plain and raw view of life, death, sex and the primitive values within this tight knit community; where girls are tested as virgins, and whipped if they go against community rules.Equality is dead...get your jugs out for the pit...[...]",2,Jug Face (2013) Review: Possession Pitfalls.,1375747200,"08 6, 2013",2013,1777,"['Jug', 'Face', 'story', 'young', 'pregnant', 'girl', 'Ada', 'who', 'trying', 'escape', 'clutches', 'isolated', 'community', 'community', 'set', 'middle', 'woods', 'where', 'lives', 'are', 'guided', 'supernatural', 'presence', 'pit', 'Ada', 'next', 'sacrifice', 'must', 'escape', 'too', 'late.A', 'supernatural', 'horror', 'control', 'dictatorship', 'pit', 'over', 'small', 'isolated', 'community', 'please', 'pit', 'must', 'make', 'human', 'sacrifices', 'whoever', 'pit', 'chosen', 'are', 'communicated', 'possession', 'Dawai', 'who', 'face', 'next', 'sacrifice', 'jug', 'hence', 'masterful', 'title', 'authenticity', 'mystical', 'pit', 'not', 'centre', 'story', 'instead', 'results', 'created', 'evil', 'force', 'left', 'free', 'reign', 'over', 'helpless', 'story', 'weak', 'director', 'initially', 'create', 'film', 'potential', 'nostalgic', 'cult', 'extremist', 'films', '70', 'style', 'filming', 'pretty', 'generic', 'director', 'focus', 'what', 'film', 'trying', 'say', 'camera', 'distance', 'favouring', 'long', 'medium', 'shots', 'allowing', 'story', 'unfold', 'freely', 'frame', 'Close', 'ups', 'rapid', 'editing', 'used', 'moments', ""'white"", 'eyed', 'possession', 'Jug', 'Face', 'can', 'be', 'described', 'drama', 'more', 'horror', 'are', 'graphic', 'scenes', 'sacrifices', 'entrails', 'body', 'parts', 'keep', 'gore', 'hunters', 'happy', 'film', 'plight', 'Ada', 'inescapable', 'fate', 'chosen', 'pit', 'Jug', 'Face', 'plain', 'raw', 'view', 'life', 'death', 'sex', 'primitive', 'values', 'tight', 'knit', 'community', 'where', 'girls', 'are', 'tested', 'virgins', 'whipped', 'go', 'community', 'rules.Equality', 'dead', 'get', 'jugs', 'out', 'pit', '[', ']']",Jug Face
