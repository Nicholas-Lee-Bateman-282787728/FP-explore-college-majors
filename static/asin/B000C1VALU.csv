After all, those are the names on the cover.  Based on the cast, you think this is an edgy comedy full of guy humor.  INCORRECT!  I've seen PBS astronomy documentaries with more jokes in them.This is a coming-of-age wishful fantasy about a 14 year old girl who is an avatar for the writer/director, a woman named Katrina Bronson.  It's full of neither shock nor humor.  On the contrary, the plot, which is as agonizingly brainless as they come, is set up in the first ten minutes.  A girl finds out that her father, who abandoned her and her mother when she was a toddler, is now a rich sod salesman who desperately regrets it and wants them back.  Also, the girl wants to go to Julliard and her mom is dying of cancer.  The sod business is in financial trouble for reasons too stupid to get into.  The remaining 80 minutes are female teenage navel-gazing.Can this girl get into Julliard, teach a retard to read by giving him flash cards, and look good in a dress if she takes off her glasses and retainer?  Can her dad save his sod business and marry a local lady he's been having a monogamous relationship with for a decade and a half?  Yes, yes, yes, yes.

The second thing that this film had going for it was that Johnny Knoxville was the lead actor in this film, so naturally I had to have this film. The film its self is from first time writer/director Katrina Holden Bronson and I for one think she did a masterful job with this film. Her Direction and vision for this film was masterful, and film was also extremely well written with vibrant 3 dimensional characters that seem to just stay on your mind long after the film is over.The story follows Daltry Calhoun as he is kicked out of his aunt's house for being a lazy slacker that sells drugs, all the way to being a successful businessman who own his own company. When he was kicked out of the house he left his girlfriend and daughter behind, which ended up being something he regretted for the rest of his life as he tried to find later when he became successful in the grass seed business. Years later he would get his wish when the two showed up in the town he was staying in and surprised him. It turns out that his ex [May] was dying and wanted Daltry to take care of his daughter June. Daltry though shocked happily took over and started to get to know his girl, but obstacles laid in the way. His company was going down hill, he had a some what of a romantic relationship going on with a storeowner named Flora, and his yard he wanted to turn into a golf course was growing oddly shaped things. So Daltry faced all challenges head on, and eventually conquered each.If there ever was a performance that Johnny Knoxville deserved an award for it was with this one. His performance in this film only helps to further this mans career into more diverse roles. The scenes he shines in particular in all involve him and Sophie Traub, and Elizabeth Banks. Elizabeth Banks is another who deserves a lot of credit for this film as well, her portrayal of June's mother May is incredible. She shines in moments when she seems the most vulnerable such as the scene with her and Knoxville in bathroom while she is taking a bath, and moments discussing her illness. Juliette Lewis is great as always in her role as Daltry's love interest, and David Koechner is brilliant as Doyle, Daltry's gardener who befriends June. Another stand out performer is Kick Gurry as the man Daltry brings in to help save his business. Gurry really shines during a scene involving him and Sophie in side a barn discussing her being under age. And speaking of which Sophie Traub is amazing in this film and deserves as many awards as possible for role in this film, if their ever was a breakout star she is the one.Mr. Tarantino made a wise decision by being a part of this film, it is a great coming of age story that I recommend to anybody who loves film or just wants something to watch. Daltry Calhoun is a diamond in the rough of horrible films that are being released; I highly recommend this great film.",5,GREAT FILM,1170028800,"01 29, 2007",2007,3085,"['QUENTIN', 'TARANTINOPRESENTSDALTRY', 'CALHOUNBefore', 'even', 'began', 'watching', 'film', 'had', 'two', 'great', 'things', 'going', 'number', 'one', 'would', 'definitely', 'be', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'Executive', 'Produced', 'film', 'second', 'thing', 'film', 'had', 'going', 'was', 'Johnny', 'Knoxville', 'was', 'lead', 'actor', 'film', 'naturally', 'had', 'have', 'film', 'film', 'self', 'first', 'time', 'writer/director', 'Katrina', 'Holden', 'Bronson', 'one', 'think', 'did', 'masterful', 'job', 'film', 'Direction', 'vision', 'film', 'was', 'masterful', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'extremely', 'well', 'written', 'vibrant', '3', 'dimensional', 'characters', 'seem', 'just', 'stay', 'mind', 'long', 'film', 'over.The', 'story', 'Daltry', 'Calhoun', 'kicked', 'aunt', 'house', 'being', 'lazy', 'slacker', 'drugs', 'way', 'being', 'successful', 'businessman', 'who', 'own', 'own', 'company', 'When', 'was', 'kicked', 'house', 'left', 'girlfriend', 'daughter', 'behind', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'something', 'regretted', 'rest', 'life', 'tried', 'find', 'later', 'when', 'became', 'successful', 'grass', 'seed', 'business', 'Years', 'later', 'would', 'get', 'wish', 'when', 'two', 'showed', 'town', 'was', 'staying', 'surprised', 'out', 'ex', '[', 'May', ']', 'was', 'dying', 'wanted', 'Daltry', 'take', 'care', 'daughter', 'June', 'Daltry', 'shocked', 'happily', 'took', 'over', 'started', 'get', 'know', 'girl', 'obstacles', 'laid', 'way', 'company', 'was', 'going', 'down', 'hill', 'had', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'going', 'storeowner', 'named', 'Flora', 'yard', 'wanted', 'turn', 'golf', 'course', 'was', 'growing', 'oddly', 'shaped', 'things', 'So', 'Daltry', 'faced', 'challenges', 'head', 'eventually', 'conquered', 'ever', 'was', 'performance', 'Johnny', 'Knoxville', 'deserved', 'award', 'was', 'one', 'performance', 'film', 'only', 'further', 'career', 'more', 'diverse', 'roles', 'scenes', 'particular', 'involve', 'Sophie', 'Traub', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'who', 'lot', 'credit', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'portrayal', 'June', 'mother', 'May', 'incredible', 'moments', 'when', 'most', 'vulnerable', 'such', 'scene', 'Knoxville', 'bathroom', 'taking', 'bath', 'moments', 'discussing', 'illness', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'great', 'always', 'role', 'Daltry', 'love', 'interest', 'David', 'Koechner', 'brilliant', 'Doyle', 'Daltry', 'gardener', 'who', 'June', 'stand', 'out', 'performer', 'Kick', 'Gurry', 'man', 'Daltry', 'help', 'save', 'business', 'Gurry', 'really', 'scene', 'involving', 'Sophie', 'side', 'barn', 'discussing', 'being', 'age', 'speaking', 'Sophie', 'Traub', 'amazing', 'film', 'deserves', 'many', 'awards', 'possible', 'role', 'film', 'ever', 'was', 'breakout', 'star', 'one.Mr', 'Tarantino', 'made', 'wise', 'decision', 'being', 'part', 'film', 'great', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'recommend', 'anybody', 'who', 'film', 'just', 'something', 'watch', 'Daltry', 'Calhoun', 'diamond', 'rough', 'horrible', 'films', 'are', 'being', 'released', 'highly', 'recommend', 'great', 'film']",Daltry Calhoun
954211,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000C1VALU,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[5, 6]","In tiny Ducktown, Tennessee, Daltry Calhoun's burgeoning sod enterprise is threatening to go bust when the teenaged daughter he abandoned 14 years ago and her mother pop up out of the blue. May, the mother, is terminally ill and wants Daltry to take care of their daughter after she has gone. Now Daltry must try to come to grips with suddenly being a father raising a child he doesn't know, while facing financial ruin.Katrina Holden Bronson wrote and directed this leisurely-paced slice-of-life dramedy about a man living down his past and his smart, musically-gifted daughter, June. Daltry Calhoun also is about  heartwrenching loss and about hope and a sort of redemption. The film is funny and touching, and tinged with an undertone of bittersweet sadness. Bronson draws out very mature performances from her actors. Knoxville is pretty darn good as Daltry. Nothing of his Jackass persona is seen here, but instead, the viewer is witness to a startlingly layered performance by the erstwhile wildman. All in all, he seems to be rounding out just fine as an actor. Elizabeth Banks (Seabiscuit, Spider-Man series) is beautiful and quietly effective as the dying mother. Juliette Lewis is warm, vulnerable and sweet as the woman who loves Daltry. But young Sophie Traub tops them all. She is an eye-opener and excels in her every scene. The picture's more about her than about her dad, so it's a good thing whoever picked her for the role has either an eye for acting talent, or just got very, very lucky.I didn't even know this film existed until it was recommended by a friend. Based on how much I enjoyed The Ringer, I decided to give Daltry Calhoun a try. I'm glad I did. Yes, it's a tiny, unprepossessing picture. But it's got heart.The special features are run-of-the-mill but nice: a film commentary by Director Katrina Holden Bronson and Executive Producer Quentin Tarantino, several deleted scenes with explanatory commentary, some amusing outtakes, and a ""making of"" featurette.",4,"""Get high on grass - the legal kind!""",1152835200,"07 14, 2006",2006,1990,"['tiny', 'Ducktown', 'Tennessee', 'Daltry', 'Calhoun', 'burgeoning', 'sod', 'enterprise', 'threatening', 'go', 'bust', 'when', 'teenaged', 'daughter', 'abandoned', '14', 'years', 'ago', 'mother', 'pop', 'blue', 'May', 'mother', 'terminally', 'ill', 'Daltry', 'take', 'care', 'daughter', 'gone', 'Now', 'Daltry', 'must', 'try', 'come', 'grips', 'suddenly', 'being', 'father', 'raising', 'child', ""n't"", 'know', 'facing', 'financial', 'ruin.Katrina', 'Holden', 'Bronson', 'wrote', 'directed', 'leisurely-paced', 'slice-of-life', 'dramedy', 'man', 'living', 'down', 'past', 'smart', 'musically-gifted', 'daughter', 'June', 'Daltry', 'Calhoun', 'also', 'heartwrenching', 'loss', 'hope', 'sort', 'redemption', 'film', 'funny', 'touching', 'tinged', 'undertone', 'bittersweet', 'sadness', 'Bronson', 'out', 'very', 'mature', 'performances', 'actors', 'Knoxville', 'pretty', 'darn', 'good', 'Daltry', 'Nothing', 'Jackass', 'persona', 'seen', 'here', 'instead', 'viewer', 'witness', 'startlingly', 'layered', 'performance', 'erstwhile', 'wildman', 'be', 'rounding', 'out', 'just', 'fine', 'actor', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'Seabiscuit', 'Spider-Man', 'series', 'beautiful', 'quietly', 'effective', 'dying', 'mother', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'warm', 'vulnerable', 'sweet', 'woman', 'who', 'Daltry', 'young', 'Sophie', 'Traub', 'eye-opener', 'excels', 'scene', 'picture', 'more', 'dad', 'good', 'thing', 'whoever', 'picked', 'role', 'eye', 'acting', 'talent', 'just', 'got', 'very', 'very', 'lucky.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'film', 'existed', 'was', 'recommended', 'friend', 'Based', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'Ringer', 'decided', 'give', 'Daltry', 'Calhoun', 'try', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'Yes', 'tiny', 'unprepossessing', 'picture', 'got', 'heart.The', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'run-of-the-mill', 'nice', 'film', 'commentary', 'Director', 'Katrina', 'Holden', 'Bronson', 'Executive', 'Producer', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'several', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'explanatory', 'commentary', 'amusing', 'outtakes', 'making', 'featurette']",Daltry Calhoun

954213,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000C1VALU,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","I'm almost ashamed to admit it, but I'm a Johnny Knoxville fan. I predicted his film career even in the early days of ""Jackass"" because he has a certain star quality, an appeal, a magnetism, and most importantly a winning personality. That being said, he has not fully realized his potential in any tangible way. Content, for the most part, to dwell in entertainment that appeals to the lowest common denominator, it is always refreshing to see him outside the element of mindless ""comedy.""Sadly, though, while ""Daltry Calhoun"" is a change of pace, that doesn't make it a particularly good movie. Knoxville plays a Southern sod tycoon who has overcome his sketchy past to become something of a regional hero. He is beloved in the town of Duckville as a local celebrity and philanthropist. One day, a former love and her daughter arrive in town with big news. The paramour, played by Elizabeth Banks, is dying and Knoxville has a fourteen year old daughter. With an added complication of his business failing, Knoxville's life suddenly becomes convoluted and his image tarnished. What follows is relatively expected. While the relationship between Knoxville and his daughter is sometimes sweet, it is only vaguely defined. Meant to be largely a relationship piece, ""Calhoun"" doesn't offer much new or insightful on the topic.But there is good news, too. Knoxville is great here, managing a nice balance of zaniness with tenderness. Juliette Lewis, as a local woman interested in Knoxville, employs her usual oddball charm to good effect. The two of them are very skilled at walking that comedy/drama line and making you interested in the story. Elizabeth Banks, as Knoxville's lost love, serves up a terrific performance. (Anyone not familiar with the indie film work of Banks and only know her from her higher profile films like ""Spiderman"" or ""The 40-Year Old Virgin"" are missing a very compelling actress. She has the stuff!) Sadly, there are some problematic performances, too. One of the main reasons the film fails to connect is the daughter. Sophie Traub is ostensibly the lead performer and she is disappointingly flat. Too big to be the precocious movie teen that she plays, her line readings and voice over narration are as awkward as her character is supposed to be. This fails to ignite any real drama and keeps one emotionally distant. Two other major characters are supplied for their quirks: a dishy Australian helping Knoxville repair his sod problem and a mentally challenged sidekick. Neither is fleshed out or believable, the mentally challenged character is almost painfully overdone.Interesting for a look, but not especially noteworthy to the casual viewer. The 3 stars I'm giving ""Daltry Calhoun"" are for Banks, Knoxville and Lewis. One each. Somewhat cute, but forgettable.
