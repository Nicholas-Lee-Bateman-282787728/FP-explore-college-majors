972097,A1ASUHNIOF185K,B000EER0QE,Arthur Daigle,"[0, 0]","The Strangeness is a surprisingly good horror movie from the early eighties, one I only knew existed by searching Amazon for old monster movies.  The characters are searching an old mine to see if it could be productive again, a plot very similar to Boogens (another monster movie from roughly the same time).  The acting is pretty good, and to the best of my knowledge this is the only movie any of these actors appear in.  The set work for the mine and caves are good, too.  The monster is done with stop motion animation and it makes a late appearance in the movie, understandable given how time consuming and expensive stop motion is.  The extras go into some detail on how little cash they had for making the film, and as another commenters said it would have benefited from more funding.  But I feel they did well with what they had.",4,Budget?

They're trying to find out if there's enough gold left to warrant further investment. Unbeknownst to them, a young couple was recently attacked by something in the mine. Not to mention the team of miners that was attacked years earlier! Of course, this doesn't bode well for our heroes! THE STRANGENESS sort of reminds me of BEAST FROM HAUNTED CAVE, only this time, the monster is done w/ stop-motion. It kills its human prey in grisly fashion, leaving nothing but a mutilated heap behind. It looks like a huge, oozing orifice on top of a tentacle-waving brain.

It's about some engineers investigating a cave being preyed on by this awesome tentacle monster. It's certainly some strangeness. The vibe of the film is pretty eerie even though it's a cheesy 80s horror film. The cave settings are always dark and the viewer, like the characters, can't see everything that's going on in the tiny passage ways. This would make a great double or triple feature with any of the other cave/mine-themed horror movies like The Boogens, The Descent, My Bloody Valentine, etc. The VHS picture quality on my personal copy is atrocious, so I can't wait to see a digital version of this film.",5,Cool Vibes from this Cave Dwelling Horror,1247443200,"07 13, 2009",2009,685,"['really', 'film', ""'m"", 'thrilled', 'see', 'coming', 'out', 'DVD', 'engineers', 'investigating', 'cave', 'being', 'preyed', 'awesome', 'tentacle', 'monster', 'certainly', 'strangeness', 'vibe', 'film', 'pretty', 'eerie', 'even', 'cheesy', '80s', 'horror', 'film', 'cave', 'settings', 'are', 'always', 'dark', 'viewer', 'characters', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'everything', 'going', 'tiny', 'passage', 'ways', 'would', 'make', 'great', 'double', 'triple', 'feature', 'other', 'cave/mine-themed', 'horror', 'movies', 'Boogens', 'Descent', 'My', 'Bloody', 'Valentine', 'etc', 'VHS', 'picture', 'quality', 'personal', 'copy', 'atrocious', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'digital', 'version', 'film']",N/A

It's time to get rid of that big clamshell vhs box once again.  Alot of folks compare this flick to 'The Boogens', another forgotten creature flick,  and I can kinda see why.  But this creature in 'The Strangeness' is creepier, in my opinion.  It's a simple story; it's about a group of people wanting to explore a cave that has been considered cursed, says the locals.  You see, miners have died in that cave and it's a mystery in what caused their deaths!  Indians for years have been saying the cave is inhabited by a ancient being and that no one should enter ""Golden Spike"", name of the cave.  Will these new explorers make it out alive!?  You'll just have to see for yourself!  The special effects are practical but you go into watching a horror flick like this just to enjoy how simple it is, and that you love creature flicks no matter how dated they are compared to todays standards.

BUt they did a pretty good job for what they had. The story is similiar to the b movie that came out a few years later ""the boogens' with a mine with a monster in it storyline only  that one is a solid b movie and this is not.The dvd looks ok but they print needed some dirt cleaned from it, still it could have been a lost movie easily with such a llmited release. The stop motion work is good here and at that time this technique was fading away for good but audiences would have enjoyed it in 1980 as not to 'strange'. Like I said if  you are a horror fan who loves these older type of c movies then you'll like this one. If  you are a snob who complains about older effects then don't go here.  The acting is acceptable but not up to the levels of a b movie probably.

There are weakenesses - the script is too wordy, for example, and some people might find their attention span wandering - but for an ultra low budget film it's atmospheric with a stop motion monster that is used sparingly in the same way the alien was used in alien. The setting looks good, and unlike a lot of low budget horrors, there's a genuine attempt to create characters the audience can sympathise.Simple story: a bunch of people go down a deserted mine in order to survey it before a planned reopening. As they travel deeper into the mind, strange winds occur, and one by one the explorers are picked off by whatever is lurking in the tunnels...
