Matt Damon was incredible in this movie that showcased elite poker players so well. The direction and technical advice were stellar and I don't think there has ever been a movie quite like it. Despite this, I found it unrealistic that he would put everything in the pot while betting against the Russian. Yet his loss served as a lesson for him towards the end of the film.The DVD commentaries were great in the version I had. All of the clowns who rated this movie One-Star bought the innital version from the late 1990s and thus missed the later versions. This is the best poker movie I've ever seen set in contemporary times. There were a few I loved set in the 1800s and 1930s thru 1950s, but this was the best of them all.Matt Damon is an incredible actor and an even better person. I'd love to see a sequel to this movie. Where is Worm today in 2012? Did Damon's character win the World series of Poker or did e return to law school? Hats off to the costars of this movie.

455727,ATXO4UA7N1HDC,6305240655,Ari Weiss,"[0, 2]","Rounders: rated R, 1 hour and 54 minutesIn the movie Rounders, Matt Damon plays the cleverly skillful cardsharp, Mike McDermott. Edward Norton plays his best friend and swindling partner. McDermott swears to his loving girlfriend that he will never again play a game of cards after losing (thousands of dollars) to a Russian mobster known only as KGB. When &#8220;Worm&#8221; (Norton) is released from prison, he finds himself greatly in debt to the Mafia. In order to help out his buddy, Mike begins to gather up money by continuing to gamble. He and Worm work together as a team, winning poker games illegally. As soon as Mike&#8217;s sweetheart finds out about him going back to cards, she leaves him without delay. The rest of the movie is the trouble Mike and Worm get into in the business of gambling, and the excitement of success.Rounders displays exceptional acting by the Damon and Norton duo. The background acting done by Gretchen Mol (the girlfriend), and John Malkovich (KGB), on the other hand was somewhat displeasing. Mol played the average good girl with no real feeling adequately expressed in her performance. Malkovich surprisingly ended up playing the role of a seemingly idiotic underworld leader with a poor attempt at portraying a Russian accent. His pathetic depiction of the character KGB did not fit in at all well with the remarkable acting by Edward Norton and Matt Damon.Acting is not all that made this movie what it is. The thrill of the game was also a major part in making the movie enjoyable. Matt Damon does a good job of running the audience through the basics in how to play a good game of cards. He explains that one must play his opponent rather than the cards in order to win. By looking at the eyes of his competitors, interestingly enough, he is able to read their minds and determine his game winning strategy. Mike McDermott insists that poker is not at all a matter of luck, but that it is a matter of skill. A skill in which of course he fully possesses. Mike McDermott is clearly a poker playing genius. He accurately integrates everyday speech with sharp gambler&#8217;s lingo. Though it is often hard to grasp many of the things Damon says, by using this lingo, it somehow holds the viewer&#8217;s interest anyway.Edward Norton's character (and fantastic portrayal) truly sustains the greatest element of intensity, and though intriguing at moments, when all is said and done, the audience comes away with little more than a cheap, dramatized look at playing poker with high stakes.",3,Good but not great,1004400000,"10 30, 2001",2001,2533,"['Rounders', 'rated', 'R', '1', 'hour', '54', 'minutesIn', 'movie', 'Rounders', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'cleverly', 'skillful', 'cardsharp', 'Mike', 'McDermott', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'best', 'friend', 'swindling', 'partner', 'McDermott', 'loving', 'girlfriend', 'will', 'never', 'again', 'play', 'game', 'cards', 'losing', 'thousands', 'dollars', 'Russian', 'mobster', 'known', 'only', 'KGB', 'When', '8220', 'Worm', '8221', 'Norton', 'released', 'prison', 'greatly', 'debt', 'Mafia', 'order', 'help', 'out', 'buddy', 'Mike', 'gather', 'up', 'money', 'continuing', 'gamble', 'Worm', 'work', 'together', 'team', 'winning', 'poker', 'games', 'illegally', 'As', 'soon', 'Mike', '8217', 'sweetheart', 'out', 'going', 'back', 'cards', 'delay', 'rest', 'movie', 'trouble', 'Mike', 'Worm', 'get', 'business', 'gambling', 'excitement', 'success.Rounders', 'displays', 'exceptional', 'acting', 'Damon', 'Norton', 'duo', 'background', 'acting', 'done', 'Gretchen', 'Mol', 'girlfriend', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'KGB', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'somewhat', 'displeasing', 'Mol', 'played', 'average', 'good', 'girl', 'real', 'feeling', 'adequately', 'expressed', 'performance', 'Malkovich', 'surprisingly', 'ended', 'up', 'playing', 'role', 'seemingly', 'idiotic', 'underworld', 'leader', 'poor', 'attempt', 'portraying', 'Russian', 'accent', 'pathetic', 'depiction', 'character', 'KGB', 'did', 'not', 'fit', 'well', 'remarkable', 'acting', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'Matt', 'Damon.Acting', 'not', 'made', 'movie', 'what', 'thrill', 'game', 'was', 'also', 'major', 'part', 'making', 'movie', 'enjoyable', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'good', 'job', 'running', 'audience', 'basics', 'how', 'play', 'good', 'game', 'cards', 'one', 'must', 'play', 'opponent', 'rather', 'cards', 'order', 'win', 'looking', 'eyes', 'competitors', 'interestingly', 'enough', 'able', 'read', 'minds', 'determine', 'game', 'winning', 'strategy', 'Mike', 'McDermott', 'poker', 'not', 'matter', 'luck', 'matter', 'skill', 'skill', 'course', 'fully', 'Mike', 'McDermott', 'clearly', 'poker', 'playing', 'genius', 'accurately', 'everyday', 'speech', 'sharp', 'gambler', '8217', 'lingo', 'often', 'hard', 'grasp', 'many', 'things', 'Damon', 'using', 'lingo', 'somehow', 'viewer', '8217', 's', 'interest', 'Norton', 'character', 'fantastic', 'portrayal', 'truly', 'greatest', 'element', 'intensity', 'intriguing', 'moments', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'audience', 'away', 'little', 'more', 'cheap', 'dramatized', 'look', 'playing', 'poker', 'high', 'stakes']",Rounders VHS

You need no knowledge of poker, to enjoy this movie, you don't even have to feel for poker at any level than the games a person played with their parents.  A portrayl of following your dreams at the cost of anything.  Is what lies beneath the story.  ""What Choice,"" the proffessor (Martin Landau) asks Mike(Matt Damnon).  That right there was basically the pillar of the story.  What choice does a person have when they are faced with what they want to do and what is expected of them.  Can they ever conform?  Or do they have to do what they want?  These are the inner questions.The interesting parts are the poker games as well.  Now I'm young, not old enough to go to a casino, and yet two months, after researching poker, using many things that are shown in the movie, I probably spent a hundred, hundred ten on the books, and got back two three hundred dollars playing a bunch of kids for their lunch money.

455737,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,6305240655,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[14, 16]","I used to go to Las Vegas about once a year, that was until I found out I wasn't very good at gambling...and even when I did win, I had trouble knowing when to quit, and usually ended up giving whatever I gained back plus some.  The trick is to only take what you could afford to lose, and stay away from the ATM machines.  I guess I was what people would have called a `recreational' gambler, but there are those who do it for a living, and even manage to prosper...I guess Kenny Rogers said it best in his song The Gambler, ""You got to know when to hold them, and know when to fold them...""  Rounders (1998), directed by John Dahl, who later did the enjoyable thriller Joy Ride (2001), stars Matt `Babyface' Damon (The Bourne Identity) and the extremely talented Edward Norton (American History X).  Also appearing in the film is John Turturro (O Brother, Where Art Thou?), Gretchen Mol (The Thirteenth Floor), Famke Janssen (Goldeneye), Martin Landau (Ed Wood), and John Malkovich (Shadow of the Vampire).First, lemme get a couple of terms out of the way.  A `rounder', from what I gathered from the film, is a person who sees all the angles and makes a living playing cards.  A `grinder' is a rounder, but is a cautious player, interested only in playing it safe, avoiding the big risks and possible big rewards, always satisfied in being able to make enough to live reasonably well.  Damon plays Mike McDermott, a law student who earns his living playing cards.  As the film begins, we see Mike entering into a high-stakes game, and losing everything in one hand.  After his devastating loss, he swears off cards for good, until he's lured back into the game by his best friend Lester `Worm' Murphy (Norton) who was just released from prison and needs to make a lot of cash quick to pay off a large debt he owes to a rather nasty underworld mob, one that kept growing while he was in the stir (that's street lingo for jail, for those not in the know...actually, I'm pretty unhip, but I manage to pick up a few things here or there in an effort to sound cooler than I actually am).  Now the boys are fighting the clock, chasing games to earn enough to pay off those who seem not so interested in collecting but more in putting a serious hurt on Worm (he really has the tendency to get under one's skin).I thought Damon did very well as Mike, an ex-rounder now eeking out a living by driving a delivery truck, trying to get through law school with his girlfriend (Mol).  With the reappearance of his childhood friend Worm, he finds himself dragged back into the life (although he didn't seem to fight it too hard), and ultimately has to sacrifice much to extricate himself and his friend from the ever-deepening hole created by Worm as he borrows money off his friend's good reputation.  I also really enjoyed Norton's portrayal of Worm, a shady, smart-mouthed scammer constantly looking for the edge (usually involving cheating) chasing the short term gains, trying to stay one step ahead of his troubles.  I usually enjoy seeing Edward Norton in films as I get the feeling he's putting forth more than most, driven by a seemingly innate desire to deliver the best possible performance he can, all while making it seem so darn natural (although his role in 2003's The Italian Job seemed a bit light...I guess it's unfair to expect perfection every time at bat) .  My favorite character was that of Teddy KGB, played by John Malkovich, a highly connected Russian mobster and owner and proprietor of an underworld poker den.  His Russian accent is reason alone to see this film...""Paeeey thet maeen his moneeeey"".  While I did like all the performances and I thought all the actors were solid, I felt like Martin Landau's character of Mike's somewhat philosophical law school professor a little contrived as he seemed only there to point out a facet of Mike's character that I felt was already detailed in a more subtle manner within the film.  I really didn't need his sage advice to learn what was already apparent, and I didn't think Mike did either.  That's my only minor issue with this film.  The dialog was excellent and snapped, utilizing all kinds of interesting colloquialisms common to the poker world, explaining meanings to the viewer enough to allow us to stay with the characters, but not treating us like we're complete idiots.  The film is lengthy (121 minutes), but does move along at a good pace, rarely losing my interest.The widescreen anamorphic print on this collector's edition DVD looks immaculate, and the audio sounds clear in Dolby Digital 5.1 sound.  There are two commentary tracks available, one featuring director John Dahl, screenwriters David Levien & Brian Kopplman and actor Edward Norton and a second featuring actual professional poker players.  The commentary with the professionals seems a little odd, as they mainly comment on only the scenes involving poker, so there's a good deal of `dead air'.  Other special features include a tutorial on how to play Texas Hold `Em, the poker game played throughout the film, along with allowing the viewer to play in an actual game.  This was fun, but since it didn't keep track of winnings, it grew old quickly, but did serve as a good instructional aid to better understand the game played in the film.  There's two featurettes, one being a behind the scenes and the other titled `Professional Poker', which looks at real-life poker, with interviews from professional players.  Next there's Champion Poker Tips which is a bunch of short, unconnected clips featuring pros mostly doling out advice I could get from my mother, ""Never bet more than you can afford to lose""...thanks...Finally there's a couple of trailers and a Miramax 25th anniversary promotional bit.Cookieman108",4,"""It's immoral to let a sucker keep his money.""",1101859200,"12 1,

455743,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,6305240655,Dennis Littrell,"[16, 18]","The chips, that is.As poker movies go, this is actually pretty good.  It is the only movie about poker that is authentic both technically and psychologically.  The only real competition is the Cincinnati Kid (1965); however that film is greatly marred by the improbability of Steve McQueen being dealt a royal flush in five-card stud to win the key hand.  The odds against being dealt a royal on any given hand are 649,739 to 1.  Multiply that by the odds against getting it just when you need it, and we are in Fantasyland.  Part of the power of the script comes from the technical help of Mike Caro and other professional poker players.  I know the triptych themes of (1) buddy for buddy (until it becomes ridiculous-as Matt Damon was for Ed Norton), and (2) honestly among poker players, and (3) The Game and male-bonding before women (as when Damon gives up the very fetching Gretchen Mol for cards and ""feeling alive"") are macho poker-guy bonding themes espoused by Mike Caro and others in the profession.Matt Damon is very winning in the starring role, and Norton is properly despicable as one of life's losers, and John Malkovich is riveting as Teddy KGB in spite of what some might say about his accent.The fact that the players play Hold'em, which is the most widely-played game in the poker clubs and the Vegas casinos today, and the one played for the world championship, lends to the overall authenticity of the film.  Again, this contrasts with the Cincinnati Kid where five-card stud was played.  However, even in 1965 that game was seldom if ever spread in most clubs, the dominate games at the time being low-ball, draw, and seven-card stud.  Five-card stud is too simplistic for the modern player.Much of the plot of Rounders is familiar and could be (and has been) wrapped around other themes and sleazy backdrops.  The ending, which I will skip here, is however original as far as I know, and psychologically true, just ask any rounder.  The key bit of authenticity that I think Director John Dahl and company got exactly right is that it takes courage and a devil-may-care sort of aggressiveness to win at high-stakes poker, and Mike McDermott had that.Incidentally, the derivation of the word &quot;rounder&quot; is unclear as far as I know.  It was used  in England two hundred years ago to refer to a vagabond.  It appeared in the clubs in Gardena, California at least as early as the 1960's to identify a regular player who went from club to club looking for a game he could beat.  The term has sticking power because the chips really are round and roll from player to player, just as the fortunes of the rounders fluctuate from day to day as they make their rounds from club to club.",4,Why Do You Think They Make Them Round?,975974400,"12 5, 2000",2000,2708,"['chips', 'is.As', 'poker', 'movies', 'go', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'only', 'movie', 'poker', 'authentic', 'technically', 'psychologically', 'only', 'real', 'competition', 'Cincinnati', 'Kid', '1965', 'however', 'film', 'greatly', 'marred', 'improbability', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'being', 'dealt', 'royal', 'flush', 'five-card', 'stud', 'win', 'key', 'hand', 'odds', 'being', 'dealt', 'royal', 'given', 'hand', 'are', '649,739', '1', 'Multiply', 'odds', 'getting', 'just', 'when', 'need', 'are', 'Fantasyland', 'Part', 'power', 'script', 'technical', 'help', 'Mike', 'Caro', 'other', 'professional', 'poker', 'players', 'know', 'triptych', 'themes', '1', 'buddy', 'buddy', 'ridiculous-as', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'was', 'Ed', 'Norton', '2', 'honestly', 'poker', 'players', '3', 'Game', 'male-bonding', 'women', 'when', 'Damon', 'up', 'very', 'fetching', 'Gretchen', 'Mol', 'cards', 'feeling', 'alive', 'are', 'macho', 'poker-guy', 'bonding', 'themes', 'espoused', 'Mike', 'Caro', 'others', 'profession.Matt', 'Damon', 'very', 'winning', 'starring', 'role', 'Norton', 'properly', 'despicable', 'one', 'life', 'losers', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'riveting', 'Teddy', 'KGB', 'spite', 'what', 'might', 'say', 'accent.The', 'fact', 'players', 'play', ""Hold'em"", 'most', 'widely-played', 'game', 'poker', 'clubs', 'Vegas', 'casinos', 'today', 'one', 'played', 'world', 'championship', 'overall', 'authenticity', 'film', 'Again', 'Cincinnati', 'Kid', 'where', 'five-card', 'stud', 'was', 'played', 'However', 'even', '1965', 'game', 'was', 'seldom', 'ever', 'spread', 'most', 'clubs', 'dominate', 'games', 'time', 'being', 'low-ball', 'draw', 'seven-card', 'stud', 'Five-card', 'stud', 'too', 'simplistic', 'modern', 'player.Much', 'plot', 'Rounders', 'familiar', 'could', 'be', 'been', 'wrapped', 'other', 'themes', 'sleazy', 'backdrops', 'ending', 'will', 'skip', 'here', 'however', 'original', 'as', 'far', 'know', 'psychologically', 'true', 'just', 'ask', 'rounder', 'key', 'bit', 'authenticity', 'think', 'Director', 'John', 'Dahl', 'company', 'got', 'exactly', 'right', 'courage', 'devil-may-care', 'sort', 'aggressiveness', 'win', 'high-stakes', 'poker', 'Mike', 'McDermott', 'had', 'that.Incidentally', 'derivation', 'word', 'quot', 'rounder', 'quot', 'unclear', 'as', 'far', 'know', 'was', 'used', 'England', 'two', 'hundred', 'years', 'ago', 'refer', 'vagabond', 'appeared', 'clubs', 'Gardena', 'California', 'least', 'as', 'early', '1960', 'identify', 'regular', 'player', 'who', 'went', 'club', 'club', 'looking', 'game', 'could', 'beat', 'term', 'sticking', 'power', 'chips', 'really', 'are', 'round', 'roll', 'player', 'player', 'just', 'fortunes', 'rounders', 'fluctuate', 'day', 'day', 'make', 'rounds', 'club', 'club']",Rounders VHS

Luckily,  ""Rounders"" works very well and has some solid performances throughout  (although I'm not sure what to make of Damon's girlfriend in the film).

I watched this movie years ago when it first came out, and thought it was one of those hidden great films of the 90s. For some reason the scenes with John Malkovich as the Russian mafia poker player stuck with me, although there is much more to the film.In the film,  Mike (Matt Damon) experiences a conflict early on when his life-long friend, Worm (Ed Norton), gets out of jail. Worm, a bit of a loose cannon, is as much into gambling as Mike, and has accumulated a huge debt that he owes the Russian Mafia. This compels Mike to get back ""in the game"" of poker, gambling and high stakes. Mike, who is studying law with his girlfriend (Gretchen Mol), comes under scrutiny from her as his old ways surface. Although he is trying to drive straight and not pick up the game, there is a part of him that longs to get back to the excitement of it. Once he gets a taste of the game and the high stakes, it is hard to go back, and he and Worm dive full force into it. However, this puts a strain on his relationship with his girlfriend. While Mike loves the game, he is conflicted at many points. Worm's recklessness gets them into hot water with KGG (John Malkovich), and before he can truly choose between poker and his girlfriend, he is neck deep in trouble with his life. Rounders becomes as much of a movie about loyalty as poker, and Mike has to decide what price he puts on his friendship.Damon and Norton drive home solid performances in this one. There's a good camaraderie between them, and they really do a great job of taking the audience into the world of Texas Hold em.There's also an effective job of making the games suspenseful and dramatic. There's a great scene towards the end between Damon and Malkovich as they match wits. Damon's character also narrates the story as it unfolds.Overall, Rounders is a great film with expert direction and acting.Definitely recommended!",4,Great film from the late 90s,1264723200,"01 29, 2010",2010,2041,"['do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'poker', 'fan', 'appreciate', 'Rounders', 'one', 'movies', 'seemingly', 'put', 'game', 'ESPN', 'coverage', 'map', 'watched', 'movie', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'thought', 'was', 'one', 'hidden', 'great', 'films', '90s', 'reason', 'scenes', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Russian', 'mafia', 'poker', 'player', 'stuck', 'much', 'more', 'film.In', 'film', 'Mike', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'conflict', 'early', 'when', 'life-long', 'friend', 'Worm', 'Ed', 'Norton', 'jail', 'Worm', 'bit', 'loose', 'cannon', 'as', 'much', 'gambling', 'Mike', 'accumulated', 'huge', 'debt', 'Russian', 'Mafia', 'Mike', 'get', 'back', 'game', 'poker', 'gambling', 'high', 'stakes', 'Mike', 'who', 'studying', 'law', 'girlfriend', 'Gretchen', 'Mol', 'scrutiny', 'old', 'ways', 'surface', 'trying', 'drive', 'straight', 'not', 'pick', 'up', 'game', 'part', 'get', 'back', 'excitement', 'Once', 'taste', 'game', 'high', 'stakes', 'hard', 'go', 'back', 'Worm', 'dive', 'full', 'force', 'However', 'strain', 'relationship', 'girlfriend', 'Mike', 'game', 'conflicted', 'many', 'points', 'Worm', 'recklessness', 'hot', 'water', 'KGG', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'can', 'truly', 'choose', 'poker', 'girlfriend', 'neck', 'deep', 'trouble', 'life', 'Rounders', 'as', 'much', 'movie', 'about', 'loyalty', 'poker', 'Mike', 'decide', 'what', 'price', 'friendship.Damon', 'Norton', 'drive', 'home', 'solid', 'performances', 'one', 'good', 'camaraderie', 'really', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'taking', 'audience', 'world', 'Texas', 'Hold', 'also', 'effective', 'job', 'making', 'games', 'suspenseful', 'dramatic', 'great', 'scene', 'end', 'Damon', 'Malkovich', 'match', 'wits', 'Damon', 'character', 'also', 'story', 'unfolds.Overall', 'Rounders', 'great', 'film', 'expert', 'direction', 'acting.Definitely', 'recommended']",Rounders VHS

Granted, it has many setbacks like a pathetic attempt at being Russian by Malkovic, as well as far-fetched card-reading.As a poker player, I understand that it is possible for pros to pick up on your cards, however Matt sat in on a single hand, and you cannot conclude from the turn what is being held by 5 different people. You'd have to watch the flop, turn, and river and gauge all of their reactions.Second, when Matt Damon pulls his boat, 9's over aces, he hastily makes the assumption that Malkovic doesn't have a flush, and declares his thoughts. I doubt a poker player would miss the possibility of full aces over 9's and open himself up by declaring he nor his opponent has a flush. Of course, it could have been a slip of the mind, which does happen in poker just like anything else.Other than that, the movie was written very cleverly especially considering it hung on a plot involving cardplaying.

455764,A7FDSGMP1F8PA,6305240655,John M. Thompson,"[2, 2]","A little-known fact of gambling is that there are many who make their living exclusively at it; of those people, the majority are poker players.  The deck itself is neutral, no matter how biased it may seem on any one hand or evening of play, and thus the players with greater skill take down the money.  It's not about cheating, which ultimately costs the serious player too much money to risk; it's about knowing the game and knowing the players.  The drama in this movie comes from watching a side of life most of us can only wonder about - gambling for a living.Despite the cheap shot above in the editorial review, adequate character development does take place.  For each of the major turning points in the film, a believable underpinning exists in the film's action, e.g. Gretchen Mol's character leaves Matt Damon's character because she feels his skill at poker may not overcome what most reasonable people would call a compulsion to play.  Ultimately, the intrapersonal relationships take a supporting role for Damon's character, as his narration indicates his underlying aptitude and commitment to the game of poker; it would make as much sense to belittle ""The Hustler"" for focusing so much on billiards.The scenes where cards are played show great attention to game details, where other films show little accuracy or care [most egregious example: ""Maverick,"" where the royal flush in spades beats a smaller straight flush in hearts and four nines].  It's not holding tremendous hands, but watching Damon put moves on other players and responding to theirs in kind.  Watching him slow-play the strongest hand after setting up John Malkovich's character to make an aggressive move at the pot...this is poker at its most engrossing.Every performance sells this film - especially Damon and John Malkovich, no matter how outlandish his Russian-tinged English may seem at times.

According to Johnny Chan, World Poker Champion, a Rounder is a hustler.The truth is that although Mike McDermott (Matt Damon) is a law  student in the powerhouse center of the New York legal community, his true  passion is Cards. Despite the fact Poker has been paying for his education,  the thrill of chance and the duplicity of the game is what keeps McDermott  coming back for more. Playing with best of the best means going up against  Teddy KGB (John Malkovich), an Oreo Cookie addict and merciless Czar of  Gotham's  Russian underworld.Between financial difficulties and trying  to beat his gambling fixation, McDermott develops a thorn in his side when  his friend Worm (Ed Norton) gets out of jail. Worm also has an appetite for  &quot;the game&quot; and a very poor sense of judgement for cause and  effect. When McDermott discovers Worm owes a hefty gambling debt to Teddy  KGB, the two are stretched to the limit to find avenues out of their  predicament. Since McDermott has somewhat of a sense of responsibility, he  is able to consult with some of his fellow mentors. Professor Petrovsky  (Martin Landau) the wise and sympathetic veteran of the law, not only has a  special fatherly tie with McDermott, but in a firebrand speech, gives him  the courage to attack the issues which each of us face at the crossroads  our calling in life.  After settling all debts, McDermott fulfills  Petrovsky's prophecy about following one's decree, when in an astonishing  and bold ending, he remains a rounder with the most grandiose of  intentions.  This picture is a journey in the art of  carefully  constructed deception and uninhibited plunges into the face of  danger.The characters in this film are unquestionably unique and  multi-faceted. Worm is uncontrollable and on a fast road to  self-destruction. And so it is that he abruptly drops out of the picture  and we never see what happens to him. A factor I found rather disappointing  considering the fact he was one of the central metaphors of McDermott's  dichotomy of life.  Jo, portrayed by Gretchen Moll in a slightly  downplayed role, is McDermott's other half, but even more important, she is  his conscience and the best thing he could ever hope for  in an honest love  as well as the voice of the straight and narrow.John Turturro, although  not having much screen time, is Joey Knish, another one of McDermott's  shifty-eyed cohorts although he is more of a blister than a deep cut.John Malkovich is as usual a chameleon in his representation of an  incontestably original character, composed of  black humor and serene  ruthlessness. Although I will say that at times, his attempt at a  Russian  accent lacks Stoli.Rounders is a story about balancing on a ledge and  hoping the wrong wind doesn't blow.

I know very, very little about playing cards, with the exceptions being Tunk, Go Fish(hahahaha!).....man, is that it?! Brain fart, I'll probably update this later with maybe 2 to 3 more that I can't think of at the moment. But, whether you play for fun or for real, putting your hard earned bucks where your mouth is, Rounders displays such vivid disappointment AND excitement; and with the cast assembled for Rounders, they all brought their A game and from the opening hand(like that, hand-cards-yeah), you are sucked into believing this is real. No CGI, no special effects, nothing extra to sell this movie because it just did not need it. There is a scene where these judges, who gather together to play cards what seems to be frequently, has Martin Landau, who plays Abe Petrovsky, assisted by Matt Damon's character, Mike McDermott, in spectacular fashion in winning a hand. Seeing Landau immediately made me think of his playing opposite of Peter Falk in an episode of Columbo, and I thought, &#34;Man, with the guys installed here to be the judges, Peter Falk would have sent this over the top!&#34; Anywho, it is very easy to imagine a person getting completely sucked in to this lifestyle because the adrenal rush, whether you are losing or hopefully winning, comes through, convincingly. Edward Norton, who plays Worm, shows the extreme of gambling with cards, who upon being released from prison, has to get his fix on like an addict. It is hard to like him because he never, never, NEVER EVER EVER EVER(what's up Smo-KEY!), considers anything but how to win, often with deception and lies. I found myself saying, &#34;Stupid, what are you doing?!&#34; Yeah, Norton can act and even with pondering how, as MIke says with the voice overs, no one ever stood for Worm up to that point in his life, you still want to gut punch him into seeing the thick of the moment(s). A+++++. ALL. DAY. LONG.NOW, to the point I made in my title. The image shown is not what I received but it's what I expected. Not a big deal, until you DO NOT get what other reviewers mentioned. Others have spoke about the bonus features, about those REAL card players which constitutes the background of how the actors were prepared to do what they do. NONE OF THIS accompanied my purchase. There is no disc menu, no bonus features and has package synopsis in both English & French. I can only assume the company who made this particular Blu-ray version were stationed in Canada.

455771,A2NJO6YE954DBH,6305240655,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[0, 0]","It took me several years to see ""Rounders"" and when it was over I was surprised at how the movies I have seen in that period affected my perception of what was going on.  After seeing movies like ""Matchstick Men"" and ""Memento"" I could not help but be wary of what is going on in this one.  But I was really overthinking what was going on in this one.  Fortunately, that did not ruin the movie or take away from the pretty good performances turned in by the cast.Mike McDermott (Matt Damon) is paying for law school by playing poker.  Having put together a stake of $30,000 he goes up against Teddy KGB (John Malkovich), the best poker player in the Russian-American mob and loses it all on the big hand he has been waiting for all night.  His confidence shattered, and his girlfriend (Gretchen Mol) insisting he give up on his evil ways, Mike know has to work on the grave shift to keep his head above water, but the dean of the law school (Martin Landau) thinks he has a future as a lawyer.  But his friend Worm (Edward Norton) gets out of prison and Mike is there to meet him at the gates.  It seems Worm took the rap when they were younger, which is why I was suspicious that maybe Worm was looking for some payback.But the problem is just that Mike and Worm represent two completely different schools of thought when it comes to playing poker.  Worm is simply out to hustle: find a mark and take them for everything they are worth, even if it means that the losers are going to be so unhappy they beat you up.  Mike wants to play the game well: his dream is to go to Las Vegas to play against the best people in the world and beat them.  Unfortunately, Mike feels he has to save Worm, who may really be stupid rather than self-destructive, but that does really make much difference when it is now Mike that is getting beaten up as well.We have every reason to believe that Mike is a very good poker player, especially after he stops by at a game where his professors are playing and pretty much reads their tells with his eyes closed.  The problem is that Mike is not playing for himself but rather to save Worm, and he is the last one to figure out that this is a losing proposition.  But there is a third school of poker here, represented by the epitome of the Rounder, Joey Knish (John Turturro), who has been grounding out a living playing poker cautiously for over a decade.  He would never dream of playing for high stakes and going for the big score.  Yet Mike's thoughts keep coming back to just that.Overall, director John Dahl's film (written by David Levien and Brian Koppelman), is a study in contrasting characters.  Until he is finally cut lose Norton's Worm is a manic counterpart to the intelligent restraint of Damon's Mike.  The strength of Mike's character is revealed when he is bottoming out and he does not lose it in the way that so many people do in these types of movies.  For me ""Rounders"" could have ended a scene earlier than it did, but the film decides to double down, making it perfectly clear where it is coming down on the question of gambling.  I know there are those who see Mike as being a compulsive gambler, but I do not buy the interpretation.  While there are those who think this movie should be the gambling version of ""Days of Wine and Roses"" what we are getting here is more along the lines of ""Rocky.""Pretty much everybody in the United States today understands Texas Hold Em, at least as well as their favorite celebrities, so following the poker is not a problem.  Certainly ""Rounders"" endorses playing the game, or, more to the point, playing the game the way Mike wants to play it.  Unless you object to the morality of the message you should be able to ante up and enjoy this one.",4,"Why do they always insist on calling it ""luck""?",1095897600,"09 23, 2004",2004,3734,"['took', 'several', 'years', 'see', 'Rounders', 'when', 'was', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'period', 'affected', 'perception', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'seeing', 'movies', 'Matchstick', 'Men', 'Memento', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'be', 'wary', 'what', 'going', 'one', 'was', 'really', 'overthinking', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'one', 'Fortunately', 'did', 'not', 'ruin', 'movie', 'take', 'away', 'pretty', 'good', 'performances', 'turned', 'cast.Mike', 'McDermott', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'paying', 'law', 'school', 'playing', 'poker', 'Having', 'put', 'together', 'stake', '30,000', 'up', 'Teddy', 'KGB', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'best', 'poker', 'player', 'Russian-American', 'mob', 'big', 'hand', 'been', 'waiting', 'night', 'confidence', 'shattered', 'girlfriend', 'Gretchen', 'Mol', 'insisting', 'give', 'up', 'evil', 'ways', 'Mike', 'know', 'work', 'grave', 'shift', 'keep', 'head', 'water', 'dean', 'law', 'school', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'future', 'lawyer', 'friend', 'Worm', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'prison', 'Mike', 'there', 'meet', 'gates', 'Worm', 'took', 'rap', 'when', 'were', 'younger', 'why', 'was', 'suspicious', 'maybe', 'Worm', 'was', 'looking', 'payback.But', 'problem', 'just', 'Mike', 'Worm', 'represent', 'two', 'completely', 'different', 'schools', 'thought', 'when', 'playing', 'poker', 'Worm', 'simply', 'hustle', 'find', 'mark', 'take', 'everything', 'are', 'worth', 'even', 'losers', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'so', 'unhappy', 'beat', 'up', 'Mike', 'play', 'game', 'well', 'dream', 'go', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'play', 'best', 'people', 'world', 'beat', 'Unfortunately', 'Mike', 'save', 'Worm', 'who', 'may', 'really', 'be', 'stupid', 'rather', 'self-destructive', 'really', 'make', 'much', 'difference', 'when', 'now', 'Mike', 'getting', 'beaten', 'up', 'well.We', 'have', 'reason', 'believe', 'Mike', 'very', 'good', 'poker', 'player', 'especially', 'game', 'where', 'professors', 'are', 'playing', 'pretty', 'much', 'reads', 'tells', 'eyes', 'closed', 'problem', 'Mike', 'not', 'playing', 'rather', 'save', 'Worm', 'last', 'one', 'figure', 'out', 'losing', 'proposition', 'third', 'school', 'poker', 'here', 'represented', 'epitome', 'Rounder', 'Joey', 'Knish', 'John', 'Turturro', 'who', 'been', 'grounding', 'out', 'living', 'playing', 'poker', 'cautiously', 'decade', 'would', 'never', 'dream', 'playing', 'high', 'stakes', 'going', 'big', 'score', 'Mike', 'thoughts', 'keep', 'coming', 'back', 'just', 'that.Overall', 'director', 'John', 'Dahl', 'film', 'written', 'David', 'Levien', 'Brian', 'Koppelman', 'study', 'contrasting', 'characters', 'finally', 'cut', 'lose', 'Norton', 'Worm', 'manic', 'counterpart', 'intelligent', 'restraint', 'Damon', 'Mike', 'strength', 'Mike', 'character', 'revealed', 'when', 'bottoming', 'out', 'not', 'lose', 'way', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'do', 'types', 'movies', 'Rounders', 'could', 'have', 'ended', 'scene', 'earlier', 'did', 'film', 'double', 'down', 'making', 'perfectly', 'clear', 'where', 'coming', 'down', 'question', 'gambling', 'know', 'are', 'who', 'see', 'Mike', 'being', 'compulsive', 'gambler', 'do', 'not', 'buy', 'interpretation', 'are', 'who', 'think', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'gambling', 'version', 'Days', 'Wine', 'Roses', 'what', 'are', 'getting', 'here', 'more', 'lines', 'Rocky', 'Pretty', 'much', 'everybody', 'United', 'States', 'today', 'Texas', 'Hold', 'Em', 'least', 'as', 'well', 'favorite', 'celebrities', 'so', 'following', 'poker', 'not', 'problem', 'Certainly', 'Rounders', 'playing', 'game', 'more', 'point', 'playing', 'game', 'way', 'Mike', 'play', 'object', 'morality', 'message', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'ante', 'up', 'enjoy', 'one']",Rounders VHS

455781,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,6305240655,Michael Crane,"[1, 2]","One of the biggest mistakes you can make when it comes to the movie ""Rounders"" is assume that if you have no interest in cards or poker, or don't even know how to play the game that you'll hate the movie or have no desire to want to see it.  When I first saw it a few years back, the only card game I knew how to play was blackjack, and yet there was something that really drew me in.  Something that clicked for me, and now it is one of my favorite movies.  One of those rare movies I could literally leave on all day.Mike makes a living and supports his tuition by grinding it out every night at the poker tables.  The goal, he tells us, is to only win one big bet an hour.  Still, the dream for him is to make it to the World Series of Poker and face off with the pros.  That dream clouds his judgment when he faces off with a dangerous and no-nonsense taking Russian, Teddy KGB and leads him to lose every penny of his money.  After that night, he swears off cards for good and promises his girlfriend that he'll never play again.Things get complicated when his buddy, Worm gets out of jail.  Worm is a card player who refuses to play ""straight up.""  He's what they call a ""mechanic,"" meaning he usually cheats when he plays.  He's got a serious debt to pay and feels the only way he can make the scratch is to play the game.  Mike wants to help him out, but he's made promises, but that slowly starts to deteriorate and he ends up being in the game again.  While it could very well be a blessing in disguise that Worm has gotten him back into the world of poker, the stakes couldn't be higher and he will end up putting the both of them into the worst kind of trouble.What makes ""Rounders"" work are the characters and the actors.  You'll find a top-notch cast that includes Matt Damon, Edward Norton, John Turturro, John Malkovich and Martin Landau.  All are amazing in their roles and really bring their characters to life on the screen.  There will be times where you feel sorry for Norton's character and other times where you feel nothing but complete disgust and shame.  I think it's one of his best performances, and ""Mike"" sums it up best when he says that ""Worm"" knows how to play the part of the loser, because he does it to absolute perfection in this film.  The movie isn't about plot, or at least not a complex ones.  Sometimes, those are the kinds that work out the best so long as you have an all-star cast that can make it work.  Smart writing also is a gigantic help, and I'm happy to say that can be found in here as well.Some cool extra features can be found on this version of the movie, like a behind the scenes featurette, a featurette about Professional Poker, a brief ""Head's Up"" game that's a nice little introductory to the game and some tips from the pros.  There are also two different commentary tracks.  The first one features the director, writers and Edward Norton; the second features pros Phil Hellmuth, Chris Ferguson, Johnny Chan and Chris ""Moneymaker.""  I really enjoyed listening to the commentary by the pros.  They're not there to really discuss the scenes or lighting, but more about poker itself and getting inside of some of the characters' heads during some of the games.Do you have to know how to play poker to enjoy ""Rounders?""  Absolutely not.  Will it make you want to learn the game?  It's possible.  It happened to me.  Still, it doesn't matter if you end up wanting to play or not.  This is a solid movie with great performances all around.  It's no wonder that it is one of my favorites, and it is one that I will never get sick of.  Take a gamble and give it a shot.  -Michael Crane",5,"""We can't run from who we are.

In order to keep his relationship going with his girlfriend Jo ( Gretchen Mol), he swears off cards from then on out, and concentrates on only becoming a lawyer. But when his lifelong best friend and card shark Worm ( Edward Norton) is released from prison, he is soon back at the tables...&quot;Rounders&quot; blew me away because of the amazing insight into the world of poker and its players. One would think that a movie focusing on the game of poker would be boring. However, the film's director John Dahl, brilliantly works in a first person narrative from Matt Damon pointing out the intricate parts of the game. This causes the card games that are played in this film to be highly suspenseful. Brian Koppelman and David Leven provide the brilliant screenplay that accurately entails what gambling can do to your life, and the tough choices that one can be faced with. The relationship between Matt Damon and Gretchen Mol illustrates this beautifully because of all the lies, excuses, and false promises that are shown throughout the film. The rest of the cast is filled with amazing actors like Martin Landau, Edward Norton, John Tuturro, and John Malkovich.&quot; Rounders&quot; offers a great look into the world of poker, a realistic look at gambling addiction, incredible actors, and a fast paced suspenseful story.

Fowler ""ben1283""","[0, 1]","Redefining the gambling movie wasn't what 'Rounders' really had in mind so it would be unwise to view it from this perspective.  The plot has Damon as an ex gambling addict who is forced to jump off the wagon when old friend Worm (Norton) gets out of jail and needs to clear a few debts.  So the plot's obvious, but at least the movie manages to enjoy itself when the two friends are conning tourists out of money in Las Vegas or beating Russian heavies at their own game.  This being the case it seems a shame that we're burdened with the obligatory girlfriend who asks Damon to choose between gambling or her.Yet the film's main trump card is its stellar cast.  Damon plays it equal parts old pro and wet-behind-the-ears college kid, Malkovich manages to inject some humour into the proceedings and of course Edward Norton, living up to his claim as actor of his generation, is uniformally excellent as usual, stealing the show again despite having only a supporting role.  Even so the pedestrian plotting and lack of true excitement ensure that 'Rounders' rarely rises above average.  To be fair, maybe I'd have thought the movie was better if I had any idea about gambling,  but it remains something that isn't too special.

It also exposes those players who,naturally, take advantage and profit insidiously from the humanityand compelling addition that exists in the weaker players at thetables.As such, the story is a somewhat of a microcosm of what goes on inthe financial markets, the greed and fear emotions that go back andforth among the traders, the majority of whom lose as much as theygain from the game, in the long run, not knowing when to stop or howmuch is enough.With a pleasing widescreen release, and sharp, professionaltechnique, and perfect transfer to DVD, the story underlines theimportance of one's reputation and ability to socially network to beable to get a seat at the tables where the action occurs. It alsobrings up the banking aspects, and loan sharks charging ""juice"", andof  collectors who are called on to act on difficult debts, thepariah mechanics, the special visual reading skills needed to besuccessful in beating opponents.Perhaps unnoticed, is the aspect of the movie, that contrasts andcompares the various protagonists character, who they really are,their destinies, how they found their niche, by choosing settings atpeep shows, or libraries of wealthy reputable judges, lawyers, atpolice officers messes, intermixed with convicts, gambling addictedpeople of all kinds, including innocent tourists to Las Vegas, etc.Catchy one-liner: ""It takes stones to  steer clear of trouble and thewrong choices"" ... yet overall, the movie suggests to viewers thatthose making no choices, stopped in the middle of the road of life,still get run over.",4,It takes stones to  steer clear of trouble andd wrong choices - Turturro,1180051200,"05 25, 2007",2007,2423,"['ROUNDERS', '1998', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'chosen', 'cast', 'JohnTurturro', 'Ed', 'Norton', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Martin', 'Landay', 'John', 'Malkvich', 'isa', 'movie', 'will', 'appeal', '25', '/', '30', 'considering', 'thestrong', 'mental', 'rational', 'aspects', 'movie', 'other', 'human', 'aspects', 'everyone', 'will', 'relate', 'nonetheless.If', 'believe', 'full', 'stars', 'should', 'never', 'be', 'awarded', 'storythat', 'happy', 'ending', 'guy', 'girl', 'money', 'then', 'youwill', 'understand', 'how', 'movie', 'remarkable', 'achievement', 'yet', 'notthe', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'due', 'Hollywood', 'policy', 'avoiding', 'tragicendings', 'steering', 'clear', 'despair', 'suffering', 'gamblingaddiction', 'otherwise', 'due', 'entertainment', 'reasons.The', 'acting', 'splendid', 'reproach', 'actors', 'byexposing', 'subculture', 'gambling', 'hobby', 'socialnetworking', 'human', 'release', 'tool', 'also', 'players', 'who', 'naturally', 'take', 'advantage', 'profit', 'insidiously', 'humanityand', 'compelling', 'addition', 'weaker', 'players', 'thetables.As', 'such', 'story', 'somewhat', 'microcosm', 'what', 'inthe', 'financial', 'markets', 'greed', 'fear', 'emotions', 'go', 'back', 'andforth', 'traders', 'majority', 'whom', 'lose', 'as', 'much', 'theygain', 'game', 'long', 'run', 'not', 'knowing', 'when', 'stop', 'howmuch', 'enough.With', 'pleasing', 'widescreen', 'release', 'sharp', 'professionaltechnique', 'perfect', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'story', 'underlines', 'theimportance', 'one', 'reputation', 'ability', 'socially', 'network', 'beable', 'get', 'seat', 'tables', 'where', 'action', 'up', 'banking', 'aspects', 'loan', 'sharks', 'charging', 'juice', 'andof', 'collectors', 'who', 'are', 'called', 'act', 'difficult', 'debts', 'thepariah', 'mechanics', 'special', 'visual', 'reading', 'skills', 'needed', 'besuccessful', 'beating', 'opponents.Perhaps', 'unnoticed', 'aspect', 'movie', 'various', 'protagonists', 'character', 'who', 'really', 'are', 'destinies', 'how', 'found', 'niche', 'choosing', 'settings', 'atpeep', 'shows', 'libraries', 'wealthy', 'reputable', 'judges', 'lawyers', 'atpolice', 'officers', 'messes', 'intermixed', 'convicts', 'gambling', 'addictedpeople', 'kinds', 'including', 'innocent', 'tourists', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'etc.Catchy', 'one-liner', 'stones', 'steer', 'clear', 'trouble', 'thewrong', 'choices', 'yet', 'overall', 'movie', 'viewers', 'thatthose', 'making', 'choices', 'stopped', 'middle', 'road', 'life', 'still', 'get', 'run', 'over']",Rounders VHS

(Drop In - A new player that isnt one of the regulars that usually play in a reoccuring game or location)  People were throwing out quotes from Teddy KGB, the Russian character played by John Malkovich.  I could tell the movie was creating an insurgance of new players to the game.  Years later you can play Hold'Em at nearly any table in any casino and say something like 'weaddy ageasieev' and get at least a couple chuckles.Matt Damon plays the main character, Mikey McDermott and Edward Norton his best friend Lester &quot;Worm&quot; Murphy who's freshly released from a prison term that Mikey might have also had to serve if Lester would have given him up.  Feeling obligated for the sacrifice his friend made, Mikey trys everything he can to keep Worm out of trouble while attempting to hold together a failing relationship with his girlfriend while juggling law school.  Mikey cant resist the draw of poker and ends up back in the frey of the Rounders again realizing that life is a grind without his true love of poker.Damon portrays the main character brilliantly and Norton was so convincing that I actually felt angry at him for fouling everything all up.  Malkovich invents his own odd version of the Russian accent while pulling off the role of Teddy that is completely unforgettable.  There's also a great cameo by the 3 time World Series of Poker champion Jonny Chan.Rounders portrays a professional gambler more realistically than I've ever seen it before.  From hiding large amounts of cash all over the house to the dark smokey poker rooms hidden away in a basement to ring games at the casino.  Amassing large fortunes and getting broke again then back in the same day.  The life of gambling is one of extremes, danger and euphoria.  People get drawn into it and like a drug become addicted, a small handful end up conquering it and carving out a life for themselves.This movie can almost be attributed to the start of a new revolution of poker players, TV shows like World Poker Tour sprang up, attendance at the World Series of Poker has increased by bounds every year.

455801,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,6305240655,RMurray847,"[8, 22]","Okay, let's get a couple of things straight first: Ed Norton is a great actor. He's impossible not to watch when on screen whether here with Matt Damon, or elsewhere with types such as Brad Pitt, or Richard Gere or anywhere. On the other hand, Matt Damon, is little more than a big smile. Gretchen Mol is a non-entity. John Malkovich...?!?! (What has happened to this guy...can't anyone direct him anymore?...okay, okay, he was good as himself in BEING JOHN MALKOVICH.) And Martin Landau has turned out to be quite a treasure in his old age. His huge features exude so much life experience, world-weariness but opened heartedness. The scene where he gives Damon $10,000 is one of the best in the film.The film...there's the rub. On one hand, it feels like it wants to be a gritty, grimy expose of the toll gambling takes, the price of friendship, the toll of clawing your way from a miserable childhood into a decent adulthood, whatever. Heck, the opening scenes almost feel like they could be set in the depression, all brown-tones and sweaty walls, with an old-fashioned voice over from Damon.On the other hand, the film is just a cliche film, following the rules of any ""sports"" film about underdogs winning against all odds. Norton's character ends up being written in one dimension. He smiles, acts goofy but charming, gets some money, cheats at poker, gets caught (maybe beat up), loses money, is told by all around him that he won't get anymore money, but gets it anyway. Why in the hell does Damon stick with this guy? Again, and again, and again? He causes him to drop his vow to stay away from Poker, causes him to lose his girl and causes him to get the poop beat out of him and to end up owing a lot of bad people a lot of money. It was never convincing.Gretchen Mol's character is unconvincing as well. It's tough to tell what she will or won't forgive in Damon. And all the stuff about law school is completely unbelievable.The poker scenes seem to imply that any really good player will always have a good hand. They always seem to be battling full houses against four of a kind. In reality, aren't most poker hands lousy? A pair of eights against a pair of fours, maybe?The scenes where all the pro players get together and chat, or play poker in Atlantic City, are kinda fun. But in general, this movie seems to want to be a crowd-pleasing sports movie and a gritty slice-of-life movie. In the end, it isn't quite either.Matt Damon belongs in no more movies. He has no gravitas, and now his smile is getting old.[UPDATE from May 7, 2010:  Since several years have gone by from the time this review has posted, I am HAPPY to report that Matt Damon has by-and-large greatly improved as an actor.  Age & life experience (and practice)have vastly improved him.  He's able to poke gentle fun at himself in films such as OCEAN'S ELEVEN and can actually pull off ""action hero"" a la BOURNE IDENTITY.  And he can really command a film like THE INFORMANT.  I still stick by my reaction to ROUNDERS...but I was happily wrong about his potential to contribute to films.]",2,Ultimately a thin movie,1042934400,"01 19, 2003",2003,3075,"['Okay', 'let', 'get', 'couple', 'things', 'straight', 'first', 'Ed', 'Norton', 'great', 'actor', 'impossible', 'not', 'watch', 'when', 'screen', 'here', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'elsewhere', 'types', 'such', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'anywhere', 'other', 'hand', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'little', 'more', 'big', 'smile', 'Gretchen', 'Mol', 'non-entity', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'What', 'happened', 'guy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'anyone', 'direct', 'anymore', 'okay', 'okay', 'was', 'good', 'BEING', 'JOHN', 'MALKOVICH', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'quite', 'treasure', 'old', 'age', 'huge', 'features', 'exude', 'so', 'much', 'life', 'experience', 'world-weariness', 'opened', 'heartedness', 'scene', 'where', 'Damon', '10,000', 'one', 'best', 'film.The', 'film', 'rub', 'one', 'hand', 'be', 'gritty', 'grimy', 'expose', 'toll', 'gambling', 'price', 'friendship', 'toll', 'clawing', 'way', 'miserable', 'childhood', 'decent', 'adulthood', 'Heck', 'opening', 'almost', 'feel', 'could', 'be', 'set', 'depression', 'brown-tones', 'sweaty', 'walls', 'old-fashioned', 'voice', 'Damon.On', 'other', 'hand', 'film', 'just', 'cliche', 'film', 'following', 'rules', 'sports', 'film', 'underdogs', 'winning', 'odds', 'Norton', 'character', 'up', 'being', 'written', 'one', 'dimension', 'goofy', 'charming', 'money', 'cheats', 'poker', 'caught', 'maybe', 'beat', 'up', 'money', 'told', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'anymore', 'money', 'anyway', 'Why', 'hell', 'Damon', 'stick', 'guy', 'Again', 'again', 'again', 'drop', 'vow', 'stay', 'away', 'Poker', 'lose', 'girl', 'get', 'poop', 'beat', 'end', 'up', 'owing', 'lot', 'bad', 'people', 'lot', 'money', 'was', 'never', 'convincing.Gretchen', 'Mol', 'character', 'unconvincing', 'as', 'well', 'tough', 'tell', 'what', 'will', 'wo', ""n't"", 'forgive', 'Damon', 'stuff', 'law', 'school', 'completely', 'unbelievable.The', 'poker', 'scenes', 'seem', 'imply', 'really', 'good', 'player', 'will', 'always', 'have', 'good', 'hand', 'always', 'seem', 'be', 'battling', 'full', 'houses', 'four', 'kind', 'reality', 'are', ""n't"", 'most', 'poker', 'hands', 'lousy', 'pair', 'eights', 'pair', 'fours', 'maybe', 'scenes', 'where', 'pro', 'players', 'get', 'together', 'chat', 'play', 'poker', 'Atlantic', 'City', 'are', 'kinda', 'fun', 'general', 'movie', 'want', 'be', 'crowd-pleasing', 'sports', 'movie', 'gritty', 'slice-of-life', 'movie', 'end', ""n't"", 'quite', 'either.Matt', 'Damon', 'belongs', 'more', 'movies', 'gravitas', 'now', 'smile', 'getting', 'old', '[', 'May', '7', '2010', 'several', 'years', 'have', 'gone', 'time', 'review', 'posted', 'am', 'HAPPY', 'report', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'by-and-large', 'greatly', 'improved', 'actor', 'Age', 'life', 'experience', 'practice', 'have', 'vastly', 'improved', 'able', 'poke', 'gentle', 'fun', 'films', 'such', 'OCEAN', 'ELEVEN', 'can', 'actually', 'pull', 'off', 'action', 'hero', 'la', 'BOURNE', 'IDENTITY', 'can', 'really', 'command', 'film', 'INFORMANT', 'still', 'stick', 'reaction', 'ROUNDERS', 'was', 'happily', 'wrong', 'potential', 'contribute', 'films', ']']",Rounders VHS

His resolve is shaken, and  quickly detroyed, when his best friend growing up, Worm (Edward Norton), is  released from prison, and McDermott soon finds himself back at the table.This movie succeeds on a number of levels, and surprisingly so. Of  course, many of those levels have to do with cards, and if (as I said)  you're not enchanted, or at least obsessed, with the non-luck aspects of  any game of chance, it'll probably bore you stiff. But even if you're only  a weekend (or rarer) player at the card table, the horse track, or the  stock market, you'd do well to listen to Damon's voiceovers throughout the  movie, which have loads of excellent information (and mirror things I've  been telling novice horseplayers for years).Other than that, the  insights into relationships, and the ways obsession can destroy them, are  profound. Well, okay, maybe not profound, but handled with gobs more  subtlety and wit than I've seen in just about forever. Mol isn't really  onstage long enough to give her any real chemistry with Damon, but take it  from me, the ways they react to one another throughout the film are dead  on. More importantly, both to the plot and to the success of the movie, is  the relationship between McDermott and Worm. Edward Norton proves once  again he's one of Hollywood's true rising talents, and the deeper  motivations that drive his character are exposed just well enough that we  can see them. Not an easy task, and one sure to be uncovered if the actor  doesn't understand those motivatins and the viewer does.The other  main aspect of the film is the suspense during the actual card games.  Another thing that's not easy to pull off, and often (most recently in the  Gibson/Foster remake of Maverick) the director resorts to insane,  next-to-impossible combinations of cards to make it work. (Remember the  final game in Maverick?) In the first scene, when Teddy KGB nails  McDermott, the winning hand is a full house. Welcome to the real world of  poker, where oftentimes it's the guy holding the two pair that ends up  forty grand richer at the end of the night. Dahl realizes, repeatedly, that  it's not the cards in the hand that provide the action, it's the way the  characters react to one another. One almost thinks that Dahl could have  pulled this movie off by putting Damon, Norton, Malkovich (without the  cheesy accent), John Turturro, and two or three of the other cardplayers  around a table and shot two hours of one game.",4,Do you play poker?,961286400,"06 18, 2000",2000,3177,"['are', 'two', 'types', 'people', 'watching', 'Rounders', 'who', 'play', 'poker', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'can', 'identify', 'way', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'movie', 'going', 'captivate', ""'re"", 'not', 'card', 'player', 'can', 'probably', 'forget', 'it.Mike', 'McDermott', 'Damon', 'professional', 'poker', 'player', 'law', 'school', 'student', 'order', 'One', 'night', 'attempt', 'raise', 'capital', 'trip', 'Las', 'vegas', 'play', 'World', 'Series', 'Poker', 'McDermott', 'whole', 'bankroll', '30K', 'owner', 'favorite', 'underground', 'card', 'club', 'Teddy', 'KGB', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'next', 'day', 'cards', 'get', 'feeling', 'so', 'order', 'keep', 'relationship', 'Jo', 'Gretchen', 'Mol', 'alive', 'resolve', 'shaken', 'quickly', 'detroyed', 'when', 'best', 'friend', 'growing', 'up', 'Worm', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'released', 'prison', 'McDermott', 'soon', 'back', 'table.This', 'movie', 'number', 'levels', 'surprisingly', 'so', 'course', 'many', 'levels', 'have', 'do', 'cards', 'said', ""'re"", 'not', 'enchanted', 'least', 'obsessed', 'non-luck', 'aspects', 'game', 'chance', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'bore', 'stiff', 'even', ""'re"", 'only', 'weekend', 'rarer', 'player', 'card', 'table', 'horse', 'track', 'stock', 'market', ""'d"", 'do', 'well', 'listen', 'Damon', 'voiceovers', 'movie', 'have', 'loads', 'excellent', 'information', 'mirror', 'things', ""'ve"", 'been', 'telling', 'novice', 'horseplayers', 'years', '.Other', 'insights', 'relationships', 'ways', 'obsession', 'can', 'destroy', 'are', 'profound', 'Well', 'okay', 'maybe', 'not', 'profound', 'handled', 'gobs', 'more', 'subtlety', 'wit', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'just', 'forever', 'Mol', ""n't"", 'really', 'onstage', 'long', 'enough', 'give', 'real', 'chemistry', 'Damon', 'take', 'ways', 'react', 'one', 'film', 'are', 'dead', 'More', 'importantly', 'plot', 'success', 'movie', 'relationship', 'McDermott', 'Worm', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'once', 'again', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'true', 'rising', 'talents', 'deeper', 'motivations', 'drive', 'character', 'are', 'exposed', 'just', 'well', 'enough', 'can', 'see', 'Not', 'easy', 'task', 'one', 'sure', 'be', 'uncovered', 'actor', ""n't"", 'understand', 'motivatins', 'viewer', 'does.The', 'other', 'main', 'aspect', 'film', 'suspense', 'actual', 'card', 'games', 'thing', 'not', 'easy', 'pull', 'off', 'often', 'most', 'recently', 'Gibson/Foster', 'remake', 'Maverick', 'director', 'insane', 'next-to-impossible', 'combinations', 'cards', 'make', 'work', 'Remember', 'final', 'game', 'Maverick', 'first', 'scene', 'when', 'Teddy', 'KGB', 'McDermott', 'winning', 'hand', 'full', 'house', 'Welcome', 'real', 'world', 'poker', 'where', 'guy', 'holding', 'two', 'pair', 'up', 'forty', 'grand', 'richer', 'end', 'night', 'Dahl', 'repeatedly', 'not', 'cards', 'hand', 'provide', 'action', 'way', 'characters', 'react', 'one', 'One', 'almost', 'Dahl', 'could', 'have', 'pulled', 'movie', 'off', 'putting', 'Damon', 'Norton', 'Malkovich', 'cheesy', 'accent', 'John', 'Turturro', 'two', 'three', 'other', 'cardplayers', 'table', 'shot', 'two', 'hours', 'one', 'game']",Rounders VHS
455803,A2RDR5G65D9H84,6305240655,Sebastian Fernandez,"[2, 2]","I have watched this movie several times in the last few years, and have been playing Texas Hold'em for a similar amount of time. When this special edition came out, I knew I had to check it out; and I was not disappointed, since besides the great movie, it includes a nice collection of extras.Mike (Damon) is a grinder that plays poker as if it was a job. He has used his skills to pay his way through law school by gambling day after day without falling outside the boundaries of his method. But now something clicked and he is making a run for it. He goes to the underground club of Teddy KGB (Malkovich), a man highly connected with the Russian mob, carrying along all his savings and trading them for three stacks of high society ($30,000) to try to pave his way to Vegas.It seems that the advice of a friend will save him from his fate when Joey Knish (Turturro) tries to dissuade him from going for it, but Mike disregards the advice and takes his chances. When Mike doesn't follow his cardinal rule (title of this review), Teddy KGB busts him for all his money. Now he is so disappointed that he decides to quit the game, takes up a job working Joey's truck and promises his girlfriend not to gamble anymore. When Worm (Norton) an old friend from school comes out of jail, Mike is tempted to go for it again. The fact that Worm is a cheat and owes money to influential people just complicates things.This movie presents an interesting tour of the world of gambling, and if you are interested in poker you will certainly like it. You will also get the chance to see several pros in action, in a few scenes of the movie and in the extras. For those that watch poker on TV and see the glamour surrounding it, you will also get to see a more real depiction of what a professional player that is not on the top goes through.In terms of the acting, the cast does a great job. Edward Norton is outstanding in the role of Worm, the light-headed trickster who has a history of messing up and who will not stop before getting Mike back into the action. Matt Damon plays his lead role with conviction, and the research he did on poker helps convey his confidence to the viewer. In terms of the supporting cast, Turturro and Malkovich are praiseworthy, so much so that I have always wanted to have the same poise at the poker table that Malkovich, when portraying Teddy KGB, shows in the beginning of the movie.As I mentioned, the main plus of this new edition is the DVD extras. First, you get an interactive game of Hold'em in which you have to determine whether the correct option is to call, raise or fold, and a tutorial for those who need help learning the game. If you are new to poker this will be interesting, but if you are an average player or above you will probably get bored by it very fast. The behind the scenes feature takes a look at the world of poker, and how the creators decided to go with a movie on this subject. I liked the care they took in researching the topic and showing believable hands in the film, as well as in using specific poker terms. There is also a segment with professional poker players commenting on what the game is, and hammering home the notion that on the long run poker is not a game of luck. The Champion Poker Tips with Johnny Chan, Chris ""Jesus"" Ferguson, Phil Hellmuth and Chris Moneymaker are insightful, but do not focus on specific hands, but on overall strategy instead. Finally, you get the chance of watching the movie with two different sets of commentators, either with the four pros just mentioned or with the director and screenwriters.As you probably figured out by this point, this is a must have DVD. It has everything a good production should have, a great film, interesting extras, and outstanding image and sound quality.

He has an aimless, dissolute friend, played by Edward Norton, who is not as good a card player, but never found something else to do in life; as a result, he haunts the seediest joints and gets himself into lots of trouble.  His worst nightmare comes about when he incurs a huge debt to a Russian mobster called Teddy KGB (played by John Malkovich).  At that point, it's up to the Damon character to step in and play one high stake poker game that will determine the fate of his friend's life (and his own life).The movie is pretty intense and gives you a lot of detail about poker.  Both Damon and Norton acquit themselves decently, while Malkovich is hilarious as Teddy KGB.

455807,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,6305240655,S. Schell,"[0, 0]","A game of poker has never been so interesting. Matt Damon heads an attractive and stimulating cast as a proletarian poker player and struggling law student who has been at the highs and lows of the grind and holds the clandestine key to a player's most valuable strategies. However, his knowledge comes with a hefty price - $30,000. Before Mike McDermott (Damon) walks out the door after looting his own apartment for stacks of cash in the beginning of the movie, we hear a voiceover of him saying bluntly: 'Listen, if you can't spot the sucker in your first half hour at the table, then YOU ARE the sucker.' Mike should heed his own advice a little better, as we see from what is about to transpire. He arrives at a basement complex shrouded in secrecy and regulated by Teddy KGB (Malkovich), a card shark with a yen for Oreo cookies and ties to the Russian mob. It is here that he takes a seat for a couple of hours at the 'Mad Russian's' table and walks away completely penniless, not to mention utterly aghast that he has lost every bit of his college tuition. Not only is he immediately disciplined about controlling his gambling itch, but he also replaces his poker salary with an honest minimum wage job driving a delivery truck for veteran rounder Joey Knish (Turturro).Time passes and we see that Mike and his girlfriend Jo (Mol) are getting by reasonably in their airy city apartment. An old friend of Mike' s named Worm (Norton) has just finished serving time in an upstate penitentiary. As soon as Worm hops into Mike's Jeep on the day of his release, he is dazzling him with his tricks and trade, cajoling his friend back into the grind. He hounds him about getting reacquainted with the four suits and later in the evening, they make a pit stop at a fraternity house to play cards with some swaggering pledges - Mike's fever promptly returns. What Worm doesn't bother to tell Mike is that he is acutely in debt to higher powers, one of them a weasel named Grama (Rispoli). Grama negotiates with KGB and his cohorts, buying Worm's debt and consolidating it to a mammoth I.O.U. It is at this point that Mike finds himself caught in the sling with Worm and the only way out is to do what he knows best - the restless routine of a rounder.Matt Damon is entertaining as the cocksure Mike McDermott, a man with few inhibitions and a lust for Vegas' lights and luxury. Edward Norton fits his character to a tee, and it's easy to see why the name 'Worm' is such an appropriate soubriquet. Norton's accustomed to playing sardonic reprobates (American History X) and calls his character 'a philosophical cheat', adding his own touches (including the tattoo of an Ace on his forearm). As Worm, he is equally scornful (minus the rigid political agenda) and a lot of fun to watch. Funny to think that Damon and Norton finally came tete-a-tete - both of them auditioned for the same roles for 'The People Vs. Larry Flynt' in 1996 and 'The Rainmaker' the following year. Damon prevailed as Rudy Baylor and Norton completed arrested the role of Alan Isaacman, each of them wisely cast. Here they make a splendid team, each dusting off the other when it suits and rarely competing with the other's screen time.Gretchen Mol barely has anything to do here except look upset every time Mike breaks his promise. John Turturro plays his Joey Knish with suave subtlety and John Malkovich is a travesty as the Russian mobster Teddy KGB - his Slavic accent is so off the mark that it's embarrassing. Martin Landau is always a pleasure to watch and makes quite an impression as Abe Petrovsky, an astute college professor. He fashions himself as a sort of father figure to Mike, offering a piece of his wide medley of wisdom when it requires. Famke Janssen is merely an ornament for scenery, but an attractive one at the least. Michael Rispoli has been cast many times over in smaller and insignificant roles but finally gets a little more light shed on him as the loathed Grama. Director John Dahl and screenwriters Brian Koppelman and David Levien researched their story well, frequenting poker clubs in New York themselves and in accompaniment with Damon and Norton. Even two-time World Series Poker Champion Johnny Chan is impressed with the film's authenticity, making a brief cameo as himself.'Rounders' has a lot to offer, not only for its talented cast but also for its intriguing presentation of a game few people comprehend and many underestimate. It will definitely leave a twinkle in the eyes of those who harbor dreams of holding Vegas' gambling scene in the palm of their hand.",4,Let The Chips Fall Where They May...,996105600,"07 26, 2001",2001,4578,"['game', 'poker', 'never', 'been', 'so', 'interesting', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'attractive', 'stimulating', 'cast', 'proletarian', 'poker', 'player', 'struggling', 'law', 'student', 'who', 'been', 'highs', 'lows', 'grind', 'clandestine', 'key', 'player', 'most', 'valuable', 'strategies', 'However', 'knowledge', 'hefty', 'price', '30,000', 'Mike', 'McDermott', 'Damon', 'out', 'door', 'looting', 'own', 'apartment', 'stacks', 'cash', 'beginning', 'movie', 'hear', 'voiceover', 'saying', 'bluntly', ""'Listen"", 'ca', ""n't"", 'spot', 'sucker', 'first', 'half', 'hour', 'table', 'then', 'ARE', 'sucker', 'Mike', 'should', 'heed', 'own', 'advice', 'little', 'better', 'see', 'what', 'about', 'transpire', 'basement', 'complex', 'shrouded', 'secrecy', 'regulated', 'Teddy', 'KGB', 'Malkovich', 'card', 'shark', 'yen', 'Oreo', 'cookies', 'ties', 'Russian', 'mob', 'here', 'seat', 'couple', 'hours', ""'Mad"", 'Russian', 'table', 'walks', 'away', 'completely', 'penniless', 'not', 'mention', 'utterly', 'aghast', 'lost', 'bit', 'college', 'tuition', 'Not', 'only', 'immediately', 'disciplined', 'controlling', 'gambling', 'itch', 'also', 'poker', 'salary', 'honest', 'minimum', 'wage', 'job', 'driving', 'delivery', 'truck', 'veteran', 'rounder', 'Joey', 'Knish', 'Turturro', '.Time', 'passes', 'see', 'Mike', 'girlfriend', 'Jo', 'Mol', 'are', 'getting', 'reasonably', 'airy', 'city', 'apartment', 'old', 'friend', 'Mike', 's', 'named', 'Worm', 'Norton', 'just', 'finished', 'serving', 'time', 'upstate', 'penitentiary', 'As', 'soon', 'Worm', 'Mike', 'Jeep', 'day', 'release', 'dazzling', 'tricks', 'trade', 'cajoling', 'friend', 'back', 'grind', 'getting', 'reacquainted', 'four', 'suits', 'later', 'evening', 'make', 'pit', 'stop', 'fraternity', 'house', 'play', 'cards', 'swaggering', 'pledges', 'Mike', 'fever', 'promptly', 'What', 'Worm', ""n't"", 'bother', 'tell', 'Mike', 'acutely', 'debt', 'higher', 'powers', 'one', 'weasel', 'named', 'Grama', 'Rispoli', 'Grama', 'KGB', 'cohorts', 'buying', 'Worm', 'debt', 'consolidating', 'mammoth', 'I.O.U', 'point', 'Mike', 'caught', 'sling', 'Worm', 'only', 'way', 'out', 'do', 'what', 'best', 'restless', 'routine', 'rounder.Matt', 'Damon', 'entertaining', 'cocksure', 'Mike', 'McDermott', 'man', 'few', 'inhibitions', 'lust', 'Vegas', 'lights', 'luxury', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'character', 'tee', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'name', ""'Worm"", 'such', 'appropriate', 'soubriquet', 'Norton', 'accustomed', 'playing', 'sardonic', 'reprobates', 'American', 'History', 'X', 'character', 'philosophical', 'cheat', 'adding', 'own', 'touches', 'including', 'tattoo', 'Ace', 'forearm', 'Worm', 'equally', 'scornful', 'rigid', 'political', 'agenda', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', 'Funny', 'think', 'Damon', 'Norton', 'finally', 'came', 'tete-a-tete', 'auditioned', 'same', 'roles', ""'The"", 'People', 'Vs.', 'Larry', 'Flynt', '1996', 'Rainmaker', 'following', 'year', 'Damon', 'prevailed', 'Rudy', 'Baylor', 'Norton', 'completed', 'arrested', 'role', 'Alan', 'Isaacman', 'wisely', 'cast', 'Here', 'make', 'splendid', 'team', 'dusting', 'off', 'other', 'when', 'suits', 'rarely', 'competing', 'other', 'screen', 'time.Gretchen', 'Mol', 'barely', 'anything', 'do', 'here', 'look', 'upset', 'time', 'Mike', 'promise', 'John', 'Turturro', 'Joey', 'Knish', 'suave', 'subtlety', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'travesty', 'Russian', 'mobster', 'Teddy', 'KGB', 'Slavic', 'accent', 'so', 'mark', 'embarrassing', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'always', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'quite', 'impression', 'Abe', 'Petrovsky', 'astute', 'college', 'professor', 'sort', 'father', 'figure', 'Mike', 'offering', 'piece', 'wide', 'medley', 'wisdom', 'when', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'merely', 'ornament', 'scenery', 'attractive', 'one', 'least', 'Michael', 'Rispoli', 'been', 'cast', 'many', 'times', 'smaller', 'insignificant', 'roles', 'finally', 'little', 'more', 'light', 'shed', 'loathed', 'Grama', 'Director', 'John', 'Dahl', 'screenwriters', 'Brian', 'Koppelman', 'David', 'Levien', 'researched', 'story', 'well', 'frequenting', 'poker', 'clubs', 'New', 'York', 'accompaniment', 'Damon', 'Norton', 'Even', 'two-time', 'World', 'Series', 'Poker', 'Champion', 'Johnny', 'Chan', 'impressed', 'film', 'authenticity', 'making', 'brief', 'cameo', ""'Rounders"", 'lot', 'offer', 'not', 'only', 'talented', 'cast', 'also', 'intriguing', 'presentation', 'game', 'few', 'people', 'comprehend', 'many', 'underestimate', 'will', 'definitely', 'leave', 'twinkle', 'eyes', 'who', 'harbor', 'dreams', 'holding', 'Vegas', 'gambling', 'scene', 'palm', 'hand']",Rounders VHS

This movie is both a buddy movie, a poker movie, a bit of a love story, and a suspense flick.  That actually doesn't make the movie sound to original except for perhaps the poker part.Matt Damon is happy in law school, having left his poker swindling days behind, when an old friend (Ed Norton) needs his help.

Across Mike sits Teddy KGB (John Malkovich), one of the top guys of the Russian mob, and one of the most feared players in the 'underground' games. Mike loses his entire bankroll and vows to his girlfriend Jo (Gretchen Mol) that he'll never play again.  Months later his lifetime friend Worm (Edward Norton) gets out of prison for scamming credit cards, yet the cocky, but confident Worm shrugs Mike's warnings about getting back into gambling and gets him to play in a game that very night.  Mike is a law student and his grades begin to slip as well as his relationship with his girlfriend ever since Worm's release. His professor Abe Petrovsky (Martin Landau) is concerned with Mr. McDermott, and his absences in his class. Abe tells Mike 'to follow your heart.' Worm is out playing in games and getting into debt with the wrong people. Mike finds out and tries to help his friend. Worm is other places getting further in debt, and he's getting his friend in debt. Mike is stuck with the debt of his former friend. He goes back to his professor, where the professor lends Mike the money to pay off the debt.  Knowing that he can beat the game of Hold'em, Mike goes to the place where this all started, and sits down with KGB. He plays the mad Russian, but will he win this time, will KGB force Mike for all his chips, or will he triumph and buy a seat at the World Series of Poker?The biggest problem with ""Rounders"" is that it tries to create a multi-faceted story where there really is nothing but poker playing as a plot. The audience is supposed to contemplate the bonds of friendship, the struggle in relationships, etc., but these plot lines are so weak in favor of the poker playing that the film would have been better off had these elements not been introduced at all. Instead, there are many plot holes and a couple of moments where the audience will be left saying ""so what?"".  The poker scenes were indeed very interesting and well done; they probably should have been either expanded on or toned down a bit in favor of stronger and more clearly defined conflict lines in terms of the supporting story.  Having said that, the acting in ""Rounders"" is quite good - Matt Damon was, well he was ""Matt Damon"" and Edward Norton, who is always good, was solid as the degenerate hustler. The greatest acting, however unsurprising as it is at this point, was the small but effective role of KGB, played by Malkovich.  He is virtually unrecognizable beneath baggy clothes and a big beard, and his accent, though I'm not an authority, was flawless. Malkovich is best in his small, quirky roles, and this was absolutely no exception. His acting was the high point of the film, despite the fact that he was on screen for perhaps fifteen minutes total.  ""Rounders"" is not a bad film because of its flaws, but unfortunately its one-dimensionality makes it only a decent film and while it isn't a great film, it is an entertaining one.",3,Rounders  (1998),1137456000,"01 17, 2006",2006,3437,"['Director', 'John', 'DahlCast', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Gretchen', 'Mol', 'John', 'Turturro', 'Michael', 'Rispoli', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'Ray', 'Iannicelli', 'Merwin', 'Goldsmith', 'Martin', 'Landau.Running', 'Time', '121', 'minutesRated', 'R', 'pervasive', 'strong', 'language', 'sexuality', 'brief', 'drug', 'use.While', 'walking', 'underground', 'club', 'where', 'rich', 'flounders', 'swim', 'sharks', 'circle', 'kill', 'Mike', 'McDermott', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'down', 'Texas', ""Hold'em"", 'table', 'gambling', 'winnings', 'past', 'games', '30,000', 'Mike', 'Teddy', 'KGB', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'one', 'top', 'guys', 'Russian', 'mob', 'one', 'most', 'feared', 'players', ""'underground"", 'games', 'Mike', 'entire', 'bankroll', 'vows', 'girlfriend', 'Jo', 'Gretchen', 'Mol', ""'ll"", 'never', 'play', 'again', 'Months', 'later', 'lifetime', 'friend', 'Worm', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'prison', 'scamming', 'credit', 'cards', 'yet', 'cocky', 'confident', 'Worm', 'Mike', 'warnings', 'getting', 'back', 'gambling', 'play', 'game', 'very', 'night', 'Mike', 'law', 'student', 'grades', 'begin', 'slip', 'as', 'well', 'relationship', 'girlfriend', 'ever', 'Worm', 'release', 'professor', 'Abe', 'Petrovsky', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'concerned', 'Mr.', 'McDermott', 'absences', 'class', 'Abe', 'Mike', 'follow', 'heart', 'Worm', 'out', 'playing', 'games', 'getting', 'debt', 'wrong', 'people', 'Mike', 'out', 'tries', 'help', 'friend', 'Worm', 'other', 'places', 'getting', 'further', 'debt', 'getting', 'friend', 'debt', 'Mike', 'stuck', 'debt', 'former', 'friend', 'back', 'professor', 'where', 'professor', 'money', 'pay', 'off', 'debt', 'Knowing', 'can', 'beat', 'game', ""Hold'em"", 'Mike', 'place', 'where', 'started', 'down', 'KGB', 'mad', 'Russian', 'will', 'win', 'time', 'will', 'KGB', 'force', 'Mike', 'chips', 'will', 'triumph', 'buy', 'seat', 'World', 'Series', 'Poker', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Rounders', 'create', 'multi-faceted', 'story', 'where', 'really', 'nothing', 'poker', 'playing', 'plot', 'audience', 'supposed', 'contemplate', 'bonds', 'friendship', 'struggle', 'relationships', 'etc.', 'plot', 'lines', 'are', 'so', 'weak', 'favor', 'poker', 'playing', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'off', 'had', 'elements', 'not', 'been', 'introduced', 'Instead', 'are', 'many', 'plot', 'holes', 'couple', 'moments', 'where', 'audience', 'will', 'be', 'left', 'saying', 'so', 'what', 'poker', 'scenes', 'were', 'indeed', 'very', 'interesting', 'well', 'done', 'probably', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'either', 'expanded', 'toned', 'down', 'bit', 'favor', 'stronger', 'more', 'clearly', 'defined', 'conflict', 'lines', 'terms', 'supporting', 'story', 'Having', 'said', 'acting', 'Rounders', 'quite', 'good', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'was', 'well', 'was', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'who', 'always', 'good', 'was', 'solid', 'degenerate', 'hustler', 'greatest', 'acting', 'however', 'unsurprising', 'point', 'was', 'small', 'effective', 'role', 'KGB', 'played', 'Malkovich', 'virtually', 'unrecognizable', 'beneath', 'baggy', 'clothes', 'big', 'beard', 'accent', ""'m"", 'not', 'authority', 'was', 'flawless', 'Malkovich', 'best', 'small', 'quirky', 'roles', 'was', 'absolutely', 'exception', 'acting', 'was', 'high', 'point', 'film', 'fact', 'was', 'screen', 'perhaps', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'total', 'Rounders', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'flaws', 'unfortunately', 'one-dimensionality', 'only', 'decent', 'film', ""n't"", 'great', 'film', 'entertaining', 'one']",Rounders VHS

Mike McDermott is a law student who pays his tuition by his winnings at the poker table.  When a Russian kingpin cleans him out during a high stakes game, Mike decides to quit playing cards and focus on his studies to become a lawyer.  Problems arise when his old friend, Les &quot;Worm&quot; Murphy, is released from jail and almost instantly gets him into trouble with a gambling debt.  Seeing his friend in trouble, Mike comes out of his retirement to try and help him out.  This is a very enjoyable movie that benefits from its great cast.  What is best about this movie is how it plunges the viewer into the world of high stakes poker.  The movie fully immerses you into this world as Mike narrates his story.Matt Damon is excellent as Mike McDermott, the law student who must return to the game to get his friend out of trouble.  His performance is very believable as he explains much of the logic behind the game.  Edward Norton stars as &quot;Worm&quot; Murphy, Mike's slimy friend who continues to get him into trouble.  John Malkovich is also great as Teddy KGB, the Russian kingpin who is also a great card player.  The movie also stars Martin Landau in a very good role, John Turturro, Gretchen Mol, Famke Janssen, and Michael Rispoli.  The DVD offers theatrical trailers and the widescreen presentation of the movie.

However, what makes this one different is that it doesn't drammatise or over-emphasise the card  games, whereby either the only hands that ever get dealt are always Royal  Flush or Full Houses, or that the players seem to possess some unrealistic  magical skills to get them.The movie is about how a law school student  Mike (Matt Damon), who is also a professional card player, struggles to  lead a &quot;normal&quot; life after his old friend Worm (Edward Norton) is  released from the prison and kept bringing him more troubles to resolve  (using his card-playing skills, naturally).  Insights into the games  demonstrate superbly how the real world of card players may not be as fun  and glamorous as you may think (even when you win).  Instead the suspense  and excitment in the games are created from (backed by Damon's voiceover)  how each player control his emotion and at the same time analyse his  opponents' tactics, in an attempt to lead them into his traps.Of course,  the movie is more than just about card games.  Mike's desperate attempt to  avoid going back to the tables and keeping his relationship with his  girlfriend Jo (Gretchen Mol) is also well-plotted.  This contributes  greatly in showing that even a professional card player has to handle all  the difficult situations in everyday life and not just the cards.If  there is anything to nag about this movie, it would be the relationship  between Mike and Jo, which could do with a touch more details to give a  more in-depth view of their bond and hence Mike's struggle to stay on path.
