She looks both disgusting and beautiful at the same time. All I can say is that that one scene should be enough to show that Takashi Miike is a director to be reckoned with. Everything in this banned episode of Masters Of Horror takes disturbance and imagery to a different level. It's nowhere near as clever or disgusting as some of Takashi's other works (Like Audition, Ichi the Killer, and Visitor Q) but this film definitely shows what Takashi is capable of and how gut-wrenching his movie material (like aborted fetuses for example) can really be.

This film pretty much has it all.  The settings are gorgeous, the scares (involving spirits)are subtle, and the shock is in your face.  One of the best torture scenes I've seen since.....basically ever (Needles were kind of scary to begin with, but now they're just downright frightening, and you can just forget about sewing or going to the doctor).  Anyways it also has; aborted fetuses floating down the river, prostitution & incest, a quirky creature, a mangled face, a terrible american actor, and a syphlitic midget with a chicken on his head.  Now if this doesn't sound like the 12 days of black christmas to you, then maybe you should stick to bland hollywood horror.  Because this baby wasn't banned from cable television for nothing.----- Because of this movie Takashi Miike is now a staple in my horror library. Nothing (in my opinion) he has ever done even comes close to this.  Suffice it to say, I really don't feel anything he has directed before this actually qualifies as ""real"" horror (Except maybe ""The Box"" on 3 Extremes).  ""Audition"" comes close, but ends up being a love story gone terribly arye. ""Ichi"" is definitely an action movie, a bloody action movie, but an action movie none the less.  Visitor Q is an exploitation flick/satire with an actual message; although god only knows what that message is.  I really shouldn't be so pretentious though, because I still haven't seen ""Gozu"" or ""One Missed Call"".  But from what I have seen, this is the only film of his that is genuinely horror.This movie is a ""must-have"" for anyone into gore or anyone who is tired of the same old Japanese ghost flick.

Drago overacts dreadfully, and the story seems to be little more than an excuse to string together graphic scenes of torture and abortion.  The prostitute's secret turns out to be quite ridiculous.

After finally watching it, I can understand the hype and controversy. This is, hands down, the most unpleasant and disgusting entry in the Season 1 catalogue and that is saying a lot since many of these episodes pile on the gore, nudity and general sleaze.The story centres around Christopher (Billy Drago) who travels to a mysterious island in 19th century Japan. He is searching for a long lost love, a young prostitute, Komomo (Michie), whom he had an affair with years earlier. He ends up taking refuge in a bordello, where a young, deformed courtesan (Youki Kudoh) keeps him company. Upon his request, she begins telling him stories of her past, her relationships with her family and sisters of the night and culminates with an outrageous tale of woe, torture, humiliation and death as she reveals the fate of his beloved Komomo. At first, the deformed temptress appears inoffensive, unremarkable, but that soon changes after Christopher calls her out on the truthfulness of her story. Through her sinister ramblings, he learns the true fate of his lover and uncovers the sinister secrets harbored by this twisted and malevolent courtesan who is telling the tale.There is no taboo subject matter that is left untouched by Takashi Miike in this slimy and offensive short film. It's all here in all of its shocking, grisly, offensive glory. The filmakers must have had quite the checklist when creating this piece- Abortion? Check. Incest? Check. Murder? Check. Rape? Check. Did I leave anything out? Oh yes, torture? Check. Those that are sensitive to dark subject matter should stay away. Those that can stomach this sort of thing, and if you are a fan of the series, then you most certainly can, this film is highly recommended. It is beautifully shot with vivid rich colours and sumptuous period costumes. Most of the performances are good. Michie is great as the tragic Komomo and Youki Kudoh's wicked performance is a scene stealer. The only performance that I found a bit disappointing is Drago's and his over the top dramatics however considering what is going on, I guess it's understandable. He most definitely looks the part and fits right into his surroundings.Those wanting to experience a new kind of horror film, I guess ""Imprint"" is the movie for you.

Unfortunately, while both of those two shorts are great, ""Imprint"" is far from it. I wanted to like it, and up to a certain point I did. It's beautifully filmed, and is quite disturbing. I did look away from the screen a few times. Fact is, the story is simply too weak to make up for the beauty and the freakishness of it. Yes, the graphic violence is awful, but it's also strangely detached, making it impossible to feel the victim's pain. Besides, you could cut out all that violence and still loose nothing essential to the story. And I don't know about others, but I found Billy Drago's acting much more disturbing than the notorious torture scene. It's so bad that at times it's downright laughable. So is the ""twist"" when it comes. Two words: Hamburger Helper. I'll say no more - watch it and you'll know what I mean. It's funny, and not in a good way. Because it means to be serious, scary and haunting. Another problem with the film is that it's entirely in English. It's obvious that many of the actors can't speak English, and are simply reciting memorized lines. Which, of course, makes the dialogue wooden at best. The ending had me completely lost. The weak story, the uninspired acting, the long and purposeless torture scenes all turn ""Imprint"" into a rather tedious and unredeemable experience. It's obvious that, while having a great eye, and the courage to explore taboos, Miike seriously struggles with his ability (or lack thereof) to tell a decent tale. He doesn't build up tension, doesn't use subtlety to get under the viewer's skin - instead he uses gratuitous and twisted violence to get your attention. That's hardly a mark of a great director. If you're a Miike fan, then this is probably a must see for you. All others, only see this if you like long-winded stories with no real direction, terrible acting, and extremely brutal torture scenes.",2,Miike = style over substance,1217030400,"07 26, 2008",2008,1999,"['Imprint', 'basically', 'cross', 'Miike', 'Box', 'Chan', 'Dumplings', 'two', 'short', 'films', 'Three', 'Extremes', 'collection', 'Unfortunately', 'two', 'shorts', 'are', 'great', 'Imprint', 'far', 'wanted', 'like', 'up', 'certain', 'point', 'did', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'quite', 'disturbing', 'did', 'look', 'away', 'screen', 'few', 'times', 'Fact', 'story', 'simply', 'too', 'weak', 'make', 'up', 'beauty', 'freakishness', 'Yes', 'graphic', 'violence', 'awful', 'also', 'strangely', 'detached', 'making', 'impossible', 'feel', 'victim', 'pain', 'could', 'cut', 'out', 'violence', 'still', 'loose', 'nothing', 'essential', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'others', 'found', 'Billy', 'Drago', 'acting', 'much', 'more', 'disturbing', 'notorious', 'torture', 'scene', 'so', 'bad', 'times', 'downright', 'laughable', 'twist', 'when', 'Two', 'words', 'Hamburger', 'Helper', ""'ll"", 'say', 'no', 'more', 'watch', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'funny', 'not', 'good', 'way', 'be', 'serious', 'scary', 'haunting', 'problem', 'film', 'entirely', 'English', 'obvious', 'many', 'actors', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'English', 'are', 'simply', 'reciting', 'memorized', 'lines', 'Which', 'course', 'dialogue', 'wooden', 'best', 'ending', 'had', 'completely', 'lost', 'weak', 'story', 'uninspired', 'acting', 'long', 'purposeless', 'torture', 'turn', 'Imprint', 'rather', 'tedious', 'unredeemable', 'experience', 'obvious', 'having', 'great', 'eye', 'courage', 'explore', 'taboos', 'Miike', 'seriously', 'ability', 'lack', 'thereof', 'tell', 'decent', 'tale', ""n't"", 'build', 'up', 'tension', ""n't"", 'use', 'subtlety', 'get', 'viewer', 'skin', 'instead', 'gratuitous', 'twisted', 'violence', 'get', 'attention', 'hardly', 'mark', 'great', 'director', ""'re"", 'Miike', 'fan', 'then', 'probably', 'must', 'see', 'others', 'only', 'see', 'like', 'long-winded', 'stories', 'real', 'direction', 'terrible', 'acting', 'extremely', 'brutal', 'torture', 'scenes']",Masters of Horror: Imprint

""Imprint,"" the notorious Japanese director's entry in Showtime's ""Masters of Horror"" series, proved too extreme for the network. ""Banned from cable TV"" the DVD slipcase shouts. Not even a close call, most rational viewers will agree.""Imprint"" loiters in the darkest places of civilized life, exploiting incest, abortion, spousal abuse, child molestation, torture and more. ""What system, what producer would greenlight this?"" Miike muses in the extras. ""For me this is like a car accident.""A better question: Why bother to watch such a thing? Miike is hugely talented, as he proved with the domestic shocker ""Audition."" The hourlong ""Imprint's"" dark beauty can't be denied. Visually, it's reminiscent of Kurosawa's final poetic works. The plot goes from strange to absurd in the final 15 minutes, but the story still fascinates with its twists and ""Rashomon""-like shuffling of realities. For those who can bear it, ""Imprint"" proves a singular experience.The story is set on a Japanese island, near the end of the 19th century. The American anti-hero, played by Billy Drago, shows up at a low-rent brothel seeking a working girl he promised to marry years ago. A hooker, beautiful despite a deformed face, gives him tea and comfort, then launches into a long story about her past and his lost love. ""I am surrounded by madness,"" the seeker proclaims once he has heard enough. But the madness has just begun.Miike is interviewed at length in the extras. He seems like a decent guy, well versed in fast-and-furious filmmaking. A text essay on the director and his many genre films will be helpful for most viewers. The commentators, oddly enough, are not big fans of the work. Chris D. of the American Cinematheque and writer Wyatt Doyle call Miike's decision to shoot in English a cop-out. They expect more from Miike. Good talk. The DVD includes a pair of decent making-of docus that add up to about 70 minutes. The letterboxed images (1.77:1, enhanced) are flawless and richly colored.

A third of the directors chosen for the first season were not really masters of anything except maybe mediocrity; another third were directors who made perhaps one acknowledged horror classic but have otherwise spotty track records; the last third were people deservedly legendary for a run of greatness but, truthfully, whose best work is found generally long ago (as in, back in the seventies!).  It may not be surprising then that the one episode that wound up not even being shown was by the one director who's been making his best work in the recent past, who doesn't even work in English, and whose work has barely seen any theatrical distribution in this country.  Not to try to equate obscurity with quality, but part of Miike's success unquestionably comes from his working under the radar: he does what he wants without much interference or commercial pressure and the results are often very wonderfully idiosyncratic and strange in ways most filmmakers simply can't get away with.If you are just looking for tons of bloody gore or cat-flying-off-the-shelf-makes-hot-teen-girl-scream jumps, probably not for you; this is a movie about guilt and the terrible things people do to each other, not a scare machine.  If you just can't deal with extended sequences of bodily harm and torment, you should probably skip this.  If you don't know Miike's work at all and are somewhat curious to try one, the best entry point might actually be the somewhat atypical slow building Audition (but watch it subtitled) rather than Imprint.  If you have seen and not responded well to any of Miike's other work because it does not have a Hollywood veneer or mentality, you are not likely to find Imprint to your taste.  Those who are fond of Miike's Japanese work but worried about how he would handle an English language TV episode made for broadcast on Showtime (which was my frame of mind): don't worry.  Unlike many of the other ""Masters,"" Miike did not have to go to Vancouver and was able to work in Japan with his regular crew, so the quality of the work is very comparable to his other films.  The stilted English delivered phonetically and the peculiar acting of Billy Drago actually are rather in sync with Miike's surreal and somewhat Brechtian style and don't seem to me to be real minuses.  The length is exactly right for this story and the narrative packs a real emotional punch in my view; I was pretty impressed.  Another plus is the substantial extras included here: a very in depth and pretty interesting interview with Miike and a making-of featurette that is well put together and informative, unlike most.  Overall, a worthy addition to Miike's growing body of challenging films.",5,one of these directors is not like the others,1169337600,"01 21, 2007",2007,2734,"['Masters', 'Horror', 'strange', 'series', 'third', 'directors', 'chosen', 'first', 'season', 'were', 'not', 'really', 'masters', 'anything', 'maybe', 'mediocrity', 'third', 'were', 'directors', 'who', 'made', 'perhaps', 'one', 'acknowledged', 'horror', 'classic', 'have', 'otherwise', 'spotty', 'track', 'records', 'last', 'third', 'were', 'people', 'deservedly', 'legendary', 'run', 'greatness', 'truthfully', 'best', 'work', 'found', 'generally', 'long', 'ago', 'back', 'seventies', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'surprising', 'then', 'one', 'episode', 'wound', 'up', 'not', 'even', 'being', 'shown', 'was', 'one', 'director', 'who', 'been', 'making', 'best', 'work', 'recent', 'past', 'who', ""n't"", 'even', 'work', 'English', 'work', 'barely', 'seen', 'theatrical', 'distribution', 'country', 'Not', 'try', 'equate', 'obscurity', 'quality', 'part', 'Miike', 'success', 'unquestionably', 'working', 'radar', 'what', 'much', 'interference', 'commercial', 'pressure', 'results', 'are', 'often', 'very', 'wonderfully', 'idiosyncratic', 'strange', 'ways', 'most', 'filmmakers', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'away', 'are', 'just', 'looking', 'tons', 'bloody', 'gore', 'cat-flying-off-the-shelf-makes-hot-teen-girl-scream', 'jumps', 'probably', 'not', 'movie', 'guilt', 'terrible', 'things', 'people', 'do', 'other', 'not', 'scare', 'machine', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deal', 'extended', 'sequences', 'bodily', 'harm', 'torment', 'should', 'probably', 'skip', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Miike', 'work', 'are', 'somewhat', 'curious', 'try', 'one', 'best', 'entry', 'point', 'might', 'actually', 'be', 'somewhat', 'atypical', 'slow', 'building', 'Audition', 'watch', 'subtitled', 'rather', 'Imprint', 'have', 'seen', 'not', 'responded', 'well', 'Miike', 'other', 'work', 'not', 'have', 'Hollywood', 'veneer', 'mentality', 'are', 'not', 'likely', 'find', 'Imprint', 'taste', 'who', 'are', 'fond', 'Miike', 'Japanese', 'work', 'worried', 'how', 'would', 'handle', 'English', 'language', 'TV', 'episode', 'made', 'broadcast', 'Showtime', 'was', 'frame', 'mind', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'many', 'other', 'Masters', 'Miike', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'go', 'Vancouver', 'was', 'able', 'work', 'Japan', 'regular', 'crew', 'quality', 'work', 'very', 'comparable', 'other', 'films', 'stilted', 'English', 'delivered', 'phonetically', 'peculiar', 'acting', 'Billy', 'Drago', 'actually', 'are', 'rather', 'sync', 'Miike', 'surreal', 'somewhat', 'Brechtian', 'style', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'real', 'minuses', 'length', 'exactly', 'right', 'story', 'narrative', 'packs', 'real', 'emotional', 'punch', 'view', 'was', 'pretty', 'impressed', 'substantial', 'extras', 'included', 'here', 'very', 'depth', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'interview', 'Miike', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'informative', 'most', 'Overall', 'worthy', 'addition', 'Miike', 'growing', 'body', 'challenging', 'films']",Masters of Horror: Imprint

I personally think `Imprint' plays out like a dozen Takashi Miike movies rolled into one. On the visual side, this is possibly his most polished film to date, and is one of the better looking Masters of Horror episodes. More art than splatter, the style of Imprint has more in common with Miike's segment in Three... Extremes, with gorgeous cinematography, lighting and framing that most of the Masters of Horror episodes were sadly lacking.This episode tells the haunting tale from the 1800s of American journalist, Christopher (Billy Drago), who travels to an island in Japan in search of the prostitute, Komomo (Michie) who he had abandoned years earlier, promising to return for her. Finding himself unable to locate Komomo, he takes residence in a bordello, where he hires the services of a deformed hooker (Youki Kudoh), but instead of taking her for carnal pleasures, he asks her to tell him a story, and so, she recounts to him the fate of his beloved Komomo, and so begins a story of rape, torture and degradation...Again it's beautifully shot, Imprint at times is like watching a painting come to life. The flame haired whores with their blackened teeth take on the appearance of oni or evil spirits, who live on islands and take much delight in the torture of others. Miike's ability to take the obtusely sickening and turn it into an image of beauty is a gift that few directors have. What irk me about this film is Drago. He gives an amateurish over-the-top performance that drew a few laughs from me, as he thinks he's in a Greek tragedy and stands out in all the wrong ways with his acting (though he look good for the part in his long hair). The rest of the actors were fine in fact most of the actors are great helps a lot as well since they bring a lot of credibility to the story, because believe me, without strong actors, this story could have been ridiculous.I'm positive that very few people could have directed this movie as well as Miike did and I'm sure that most horror fans will just love this episode.

1004502,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000GI3RHY,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[19, 24]","Having viewed the entire ""Masters of Horror"" series, I was curious to see this episode that was ""Banned From Cable Broadcast.""  It seems pretty silly in this day and age that something is ""banned"" from pay TV, and it's not as if Takeshi Miike doesn't have his films shown over here!  But, OK, whatever.  Miike is a colorful director who specialize in squeamish, sometimes graphic, torture horror.  Probably his biggest film stateside is ""Audition"" which is certainly noteworthy, but my personal favorite is the bizarre musical ""Happiness of the Katakuris"" (currently out of print, but worth locating if you like absurd comedy).So on to ""Imprint.""  I'm pleased to say that ""Imprint"" is actually one of the stronger entries in the series.  And seeing how dismal the first couple of episodes in season 2 are (it is currently broadcasting), I'm disappointed this wasn't made available.  As the story begins, we're traveling down a river of death to an island of demons and prostitutes--and I was scared this episode would rapidly devolve into supernatural mumbo jumbo.  It settles, however, into a two character drama with one of the disfigured prostitutes relating the story of the visitor's lost love.  It's a fascinating tale that continues to evolve the more the guest presses for the truth.  And the revelations are satisfying, if bizarre.  I enjoyed this lurid tale very much.Along the way, we get torture and plenty of abortions--and I suppose that is the controversial nature of this film (the abortions, I mean--violence is never controversial).  No one, however, watching ""Masters of Horror"" would be the least bit put out by these scenes.  If you are expecting something you've never seen before--there's nothing in ""Imprint"" that going to particularly shock you.  But that said, it is definitely an accomplished and disturbing tale worth taking a look at.

However, he cannot locate her and searches for her everywhere in Japan.  Finally, he comes onto an island that seems to be littered with prostitues.  It is rumored that demons dwell there as well.Immediately, the journalist inquires a little person has heard of or seen Komomo, his lover.  When he gets a negative reply, he turns around to leave.

She also gets burned by some sticks and pees on herself.You get to see the girls childhood where she was poor and her mom was an abortionist for some poor village.You get to see some bloody baby corpses, which are like almost full grown, i guess thats how they do it.and then something dumb happens, like a twist or something. and i think at the end it turns out that the girl has like another head or something equally as funny.THE END.TERRIBLE MOVIE!!!!!!",1,A Takashi Miike fan says:,1181865600,"06 15, 2007",2007,1720,"['do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'was', 'banned', 'how', 'graphic', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'banned', 'just', 'downright', 'terrible', 'film', 'Here', 'why:1', 'acting', 'horrible', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'having', 'characters', 'speaking', 'english', 'was', 'directors', 'advantage.2', 'violence', 'seriously', 'pointless', 'torture', 'scene', 'just', 'ridiculous', 'embarassing.3', 'Now', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'story', 'make', 'sense', ""n't"", 'seriously', 'ughh', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'wan', 'bother', 'going', 'painful', 'really.4', 'ending', 'AHAHAHA', 'man', 'nevermind', 'buy', 'just', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'terrible', 'am', 'fan', 'Takashi', 'Miike', 'seriously', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'much', 'disliked', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'finish', 'something', ""n't"", 'happen', 'often.You', 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'going', 'spoil', 'film', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'money', 'man', 'brothel', 'kind', 'thing.He', 'meets', 'girl', 'scar', 'face.I', 'guess', 'hes', 'looking', 'girl', 'was', 'love', 'worked', 'there.She', 'story', 'what', 'happened', 'her.You', 'get', 'watch', 'get', 'tortured', 'head', 'brothel', 'lady', 'stole', 'something', 'was', 'framed.You', 'watch', 'get', 'needles', 'shoved', 'fingernails', 'also', 'burned', 'sticks', 'pees', 'herself.You', 'get', 'see', 'girls', 'childhood', 'where', 'was', 'poor', 'mom', 'was', 'abortionist', 'poor', 'village.You', 'get', 'see', 'bloody', 'baby', 'corpses', 'are', 'almost', 'full', 'grown', 'i', 'guess', 'thats', 'how', 'do', 'it.and', 'then', 'something', 'dumb', 'twist', 'something', 'i', 'think', 'end', 'out', 'girl', 'head', 'something', 'equally', 'funny.THE', 'END.TERRIBLE', 'MOVIE']",Masters of Horror: Imprint

Durham ""Big Evil""","[4, 7]","Showtime's Masters of Horror series has had it's share of up's and down's with little middle ground in between, but Imprint shines as undoubtedly one of the best episodes of the entire series.  Originally banned from broadcasting on Showtime, Imprint is from Takashi Miike, the man who brought us Audition, and he doesn't disappoint in the shock department.  Billy Drago plays an American searching for an Asian prostitute he fell in love with years before.  His search brings him to a mysterious place where a disfigured woman tells him the chilling and horiffic tale of her fate.  Considering some of the content we've seen on episodes previous to Miike's (in terms of gore) the banning of Imprint doesn't make entirely too much sense.  The story and imagry however, including a stream of aborted baby fetuses, could be reason enough alone.  However, Miike's uncpmpromising vision is what makes Imprint so good in the first place.  He's always been a director who has never been afraid to take risks, and he knows how to get under your skin.  Imprint does just that, and it is undoubtedly one of the best episodes ever produced for Masters of Horror.  The only downsides of Imprint is Billy Drago's overacting, and the grisly content is definitely not for everyone, but in this age of Eli Roth's Hostel films and torture horror being all the rage, Imprint shines above them all.",4,One of the best episodes of the entire series,1181347200,"06 9, 2007",2007,1380,"['Showtime', 'Masters', 'Horror', 'series', 'had', 'share', 'up', 'down', 'little', 'middle', 'ground', 'Imprint', 'shines', 'undoubtedly', 'one', 'best', 'episodes', 'entire', 'series', 'Originally', 'banned', 'broadcasting', 'Showtime', 'Imprint', 'Takashi', 'Miike', 'man', 'who', 'brought', 'Audition', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'shock', 'department', 'Billy', 'Drago', 'American', 'searching', 'Asian', 'prostitute', 'fell', 'love', 'years', 'search', 'mysterious', 'place', 'where', 'disfigured', 'woman', 'chilling', 'horiffic', 'tale', 'fate', 'Considering', 'content', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'episodes', 'previous', 'Miike', 'terms', 'gore', 'banning', 'Imprint', ""n't"", 'make', 'entirely', 'too', 'much', 'sense', 'story', 'imagry', 'however', 'including', 'stream', 'aborted', 'baby', 'fetuses', 'could', 'be', 'reason', 'enough', 'alone', 'However', 'Miike', 'uncpmpromising', 'vision', 'what', 'Imprint', 'so', 'good', 'first', 'place', 'always', 'been', 'director', 'who', 'never', 'been', 'afraid', 'take', 'risks', 'how', 'get', 'skin', 'Imprint', 'just', 'undoubtedly', 'one', 'best', 'episodes', 'ever', 'produced', 'Masters', 'Horror', 'only', 'downsides', 'Imprint', 'Billy', 'Drago', 'overacting', 'grisly', 'content', 'definitely', 'not', 'everyone', 'age', 'Eli', 'Roth', 'Hostel', 'films', 'torture', 'horror', 'being', 'rage', 'Imprint', 'shines']",Masters of Horror: Imprint
1004511,A11EQ2TAGTPQDB,B000GI3RHY,Paul Schifferli,"[9, 17]","""Imprint"" of the Masters of Horror is probably my least favorite of the Masters of Horror series. I'll grant, it has an interesting ""twist ending"" and I do enjoy Billy Drago's excellent performance, but this episode was ALL about making the audience as uncomfortable as possible.Throughout the film, we see aborted fetuses floating through a river, women getting beaten, a scene of implied rape of a child by her father, and a brutally LONG and graphic scene of torture to a completely innocent character. This film, directed by Takashi Miike, who loves to disgust his audience, is a grotesque, vile piece of cinema.Even though you know it's all fake, it's still a very unpleasant ordeal. Now, I know some will step up and say that ""the graphic daring films like this are what make horror films of today great"", but frankly I disagree with that. Because this film, and most of Miike's films apply the most basic tactic to achieve fear: pain. The most graphic depictions of unbearable torture, mixed with the subcious empathy of the audience is an easy way to achieve horror from the viewer. I never felt any real fear from this episode, just cringed at the thought of how much pain the woman being tortured was going through. And that is basic, simplistic, easy to achieve.The only person I could imagine enjoying this episode is a sado masochist.I give this episodea second star ONLY because of Billy Drago's performance",2,How many torture scenes can I fit in an hour?,1188691200,"09 2, 2007",2007,1421,"['Imprint', 'Masters', 'Horror', 'probably', 'least', 'favorite', 'Masters', 'Horror', 'series', ""'ll"", 'grant', 'interesting', 'twist', 'ending', 'do', 'enjoy', 'Billy', 'Drago', 'excellent', 'performance', 'episode', 'was', 'making', 'audience', 'as', 'uncomfortable', 'film', 'see', 'aborted', 'fetuses', 'floating', 'river', 'women', 'getting', 'beaten', 'scene', 'implied', 'rape', 'child', 'father', 'brutally', 'LONG', 'graphic', 'scene', 'torture', 'completely', 'innocent', 'character', 'film', 'directed', 'Takashi', 'Miike', 'who', 'disgust', 'audience', 'grotesque', 'vile', 'piece', 'cinema.Even', 'know', 'fake', 'still', 'very', 'unpleasant', 'ordeal', 'Now', 'know', 'will', 'step', 'up', 'say', 'graphic', 'daring', 'films', 'are', 'what', 'make', 'horror', 'films', 'today', 'great', 'frankly', 'disagree', 'film', 'most', 'Miike', 'films', 'apply', 'most', 'basic', 'tactic', 'achieve', 'fear', 'pain', 'most', 'graphic', 'depictions', 'unbearable', 'torture', 'mixed', 'subcious', 'empathy', 'audience', 'easy', 'way', 'achieve', 'horror', 'viewer', 'never', 'felt', 'real', 'fear', 'episode', 'just', 'cringed', 'thought', 'how', 'much', 'pain', 'woman', 'being', 'tortured', 'was', 'going', 'basic', 'simplistic', 'easy', 'achieve.The', 'only', 'person', 'could', 'imagine', 'enjoying', 'episode', 'sado', 'masochist.I', 'give', 'episodea', 'second', 'star', 'ONLY', 'Billy', 'Drago', 'performance']",Masters of Horror: Imprint
1004512,AQ2UN38CMK119,B000GI3RHY,P. Mann,"[5, 9]","The plot, or at least as much of it as can be determined, is fairly straightforward. An American (Billy Drago) travels to a brothel on an island of demons and prostitutes in search of a woman (Michie Ito) he promised years before to take to America with him. There, he meets a young prostitute (Youki Kudoh) with a facial deformity, and she tells him that the woman he seeks is no longer alive, having hanged herself some time previously. This news drives Drago into a rage, and he begs the woman for the full story. What follows is a series of stories that serve primarily as a pretext for torture, incest, misogynistic abuse, and graphic abortions.There are, at least to me, several problems with this film. First, the acting is awful. Drago in particular is histrionic, and his character therefore never becomes real. Instead, I saw a man acting as someone in emotional agony. I got the idea, but I never felt any truth behind it. Next, the violence. Director Miike can be expected to deliver graphic scenes, and he does not fail here, but the graphic scenes are all of violence against women. It may be unfair to accuse Miike of misogyny, especially in light of the directionAuditiontakes, but had Imprint been my sole exposure to him, I'd have been hard to convince otherwise. Though only an hour long, Imprint features such unrelenting violence against women that it seems to last much longer.My next complaint is the torture. The level here is not as bad as in theThe Guinea Pigfilms (and at least has some context to support it, unlikeDevil's Experiment, one of the Guinea Pig films), but the context seems a pretext. Simply put, torture for the sake of torture doesn't make an enjoyable film for me.Finally, the plot itself is inconsistent. As another reviewer sagely noted, after a few minutes, the film settles into a two-character study, but this study proves problematic. There are echoes ofRashomonhere as the woman's story changes with each retelling, but the progression of stories lacks the purpose present in the Kurosawa classic. Instead, we just get variations on themes, leading to an absurd twist in the last ten minutes that makes the film into a farce. I found myself laughing at the film, a sure sign that the movie had failed in whatever goals Miike had.Ultimately, I found this film lacking almost everything that I look for in a good horror film. There was no suspense, and there were no genuine scares. Yes, there are elements of horror--violence, demons, a supernatural theme--, but, like the film itself, the elements never ossify into the real deal. And so there you have it. This film didn't work for me. It did for others, though, so if you're reading this wondering whether you should buy Imprint, compare the reviews and see whose tastes better suit you. And on the topic of taste, there's one more link I have to include: Hamburger Helper.

1004516,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000GI3RHY,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 1]","Masters of Horror: Imprint (Takashi Miike, 2005)After seeing Dario Argento's amazing, disgusting Jenifer, I wondered what Takashi Miike could have possibly done to make his Masters of Horror entry, Imprint, so disgusting that Showtime wouldn't even air it. (As I understand it--I don't get showtime, which is why I'm renting these piecemeal as I can find them--they did eventually show it, though in a heavily-edited form.) Well, now I've seen it, and my question hasn't been answered; if anything I'm even more confused.Imprint will be most familiar to Miike fans who've seen Sabu; it's another made-for-TV costume drama, though time constraints stopped Miike from really pulling out all the stops here like he did for Sabu. Instead, he gets story-heavy, using the atmosphere more as a prop than as a character in itself. If you're gonna do that, you've gotta have one helluva story. And he does. Christopher (Billy Drago) is an American who fell in love with Komomo, a Japanese whore (Michie Ito), and has returned to take her back to America, marry her, and, in his words, ""give her the life she deserves."" She is no longer where he found her, and so goes on a long, long trek through Japan to find her. As the scene opens, he's on a boat to a mysterious island, ""populated,"" we are told, ""only by demons and whores."" (Whether the demons are of the literal or metaphoric variety is left to the viewer to decide, however.) When he gets there, he's told by the disfigured, rather slimy pimp (Audition's Toshie Negishi) that Komomo was never there, but offers to put him up for the night anyway, pairing him with a nameless woman (Memoirs of a Geisha's Youki Kudoh), who has a deformed face--and a surprising tale to tell that changes, bobs, and weaves as Christopher tries to get closer to the true fate of his beloved. (Those who've seen Miike's infamous Ichi the Killer will recognize the woman's facial deformity with some mirth, I'd warrant.) When he does finally uncover the truth, it's certainly not what he was expecting.As an allegory for various of the seven deadly sins, it's hard to paint Imprint as anything but a success. Problem is, that sort of thinking will only come a while after you've seen the film. At is more basic visceral level--that of being a short horror story--it doesn't work nearly as well, which is (to me) very surprising for a director of Miike's caliber. I've no idea whether it has anything to do with this being Miike's first film directed completely in the English language (which Miike doesn't seem to speak terribly well), but I get the feeling that that had more than a little to do with Billy Drago's almost ludicrous overacting; a lot of the drawn-out howling inflection does have a tinge of the Japanese about it. Also, while the effects budget is nowhere near what Miike enjoyed while making, say, Sabu or Gozu, Argento had a similarlty basement budget, but used it to stunning effect, even when the effects were cheesy.

1004517,ACTYP447JCDX0,B000GI3RHY,Scott Bresinger,"[7, 10]","Takashi Miike's entry into Showtime's ""Masters Of Horror"" series, in which a bunch of spooky directors get their shot to make a one-hour, no-holds-barred film, became somewhat notorious after the pay cable net decided against broadcasting it.  In a series where gory violence was the norm, how bad could this one be?  Of course, anyone who's seen Miike films such as ""Audition"" or ""Visitor Q"" could tell you that he can make Rob Zombie's hardcore-horrific ""The Devil's Rejects"" look like Disney.  Still, here Miike would be constrained a bit by the format and even the language (this is his first picture in English), so it couldn't be that far beyond the pale, could it?  Well, my fellow perverts, while ""Imprint"" does not mark a new extreme in the extremes of extremity, it's definitely one of the most grotesque of the ""Masters"" series.  It's also one of the best.An American (Billy Drago, doing a David Carradine impression) travels to a small Japanese island that serves as a brothel/village to find the beautiful young prostitute he fell in love with and vows to rescue.  Unable to find her, he instead spends the night in conversation with another prostitute with a facial deformity.  She tells him about her life, and weirdness ensues.  What probably got this episode pulled might have been the extended, unrelenting torture scene, but it was probably the subplot involving an abortionist, with graphic shots of dead fetuses left to drift away in a stream.  In any case, it's more than even a few supposedly sick gore-hounds will be comfortable with (of course, I remember reading that ""Reservoir Dogs"" caused more than a few walk-outs when it was shown at a horror film festival).  Anyway, by the end, the naturalism of the novel this was based on has been replaced by dark supernatural elements and even some out-and-out surrealism.  Actually, many will want to criticize this not for all that, but for what appears to be Drago's blatant overacting.  In my opinion, though, even that fit in with the general tone that Miike sets.The disc also includes some long featurettes, which give plenty of information about the method to Miike's madness.  While ""Imprint"" is kind of like the director is working with one hand painfully binded behind his back and then hacked off (for a more ""pure"" experience, see ""Ichi the Killer""), this is still way more stylish than most of the other MOH episodes, with the possible exception of Lucky McKee's entry, ""Sick Girl.""

This much-rumored-about episode of the series became notorious in the horror world as the first installment to be denied an airing due to Showtime's rules. Although,""Masters Of Horror"" was fully funded even before Showtime came along, according to the series creator Mick Garris, the directors involved were given totally free reign as to what stories they told and how they wanted to tell them. But when Showtime came on board, they, of course laid out a handful of rules. One was, there could be no full frontal male nudity. Another was, there could be no violence committed on a child by another child (but violence on adults by children or children on adults was fine). Yeah, OK then... Originally the episodes were just going to be released on DVD by Anchor Bay Entertainment.The story follows an American(Billy Drago)ex-G.I. on a journey to a creepy island bordello in Japan. He is frantically searching for a girl he made a promise to during wartime but lost touch with many years before. The deformed prostitute he meets on the island has many stories to tell regarding his girl and they abound in incest, abortion, murder, and one of the most horrendous torture scenes (with the real life writer of the short story in the grisly role of the middle-aged whore-bully) ever produced.

This kinda got some fans angry coz this was a series that was supposed to be no holds barred and allowed directors to make whatever the hell they wanted.  We caught the first glimpse of censorship with Argento's episode Jenifer, but who knew they'd ban a whole episode?  Is the episode really that gruesome?  I'm sure many folks are very curious about that.  Unfortunately, the answer's ""no"".  All hype, all talk.  There is absolutely no reason why this episode couldn't have been aired... not one.  I know the idea of what's extreme varies from person to person, but there were reviews written by critics, who review horror films exclusively, that thought this was an insane amount of violence.  Almost every review I've read says the first 30-40 minutes puts you in a false sense of security, then the last 20 minutes is a nonstop gorefest.  Were these people watching a different movie than me?  What's with the mass hysteria?  Now, I'm not some tough guy who claims nothing can unsettle or shock me, but even my wife said it wasn't all that graphic, and she gets queasy watching CSI and House.  The only reason for the ban was because the topic of abortion in the states is about as hot as a two peckered billygoat.  Rubber fetuses thrown into a river is wayyyyyyy over the line.  But torturing prostitutes, drilling out women's eyes(Coscarelli's episode), eating a teenager's penis(Argento's), having a baby get eaten by a rat(Gordon's) and running your intestines though a film projector(Carpenter's) are all fine and wholesome enough.  Oh, well.  Is the movie good?  Opinions vary, but I thought the film was actually pretty good.  I honestly never cared much for Miike's style, but I always respected the guy, and I did like this one.  Though it will only appeal to horror fans I wouldn't call it a horror film.

This is the film's uncut version that almost never made it to U.S. audiences.In 19th century Japan, (when the West began to influence Japan), an American (Billy Drago) arrives in an isolated area in search of a Japanese prostitute that he had fallen in love with. He has traveled far in search of a woman named Komomo (Michie), traveling from brothel to brothel in hopes of liberating the kindly woman from her plight. Night falls, and he has no choice but to spend the night in this forsaken town and he is kept company by a kindly courtesan with a deformed face. This mysterious woman (Youki Kudoh) has tales of his beloved Komomo and as to how she had passed away. The man insists on knowing the truth; little does he know that some stories are better left untold.IMPRINT is a very disturbing mindblower of a story based on the Japanese horror novel ""Bokee Kyotee"" by Shimako Iwai and adapted for the screen by Daisuke Tengan (Audition). The film is an unspeakabe orgy of torture and depravity, extreme cruelty and perverse vengeance, twisted secrets and stunning revelations. The film's story is told in flashbacks as told by the deformed courtesan played by Youki Kudoh (Memoirs of a Geisha, Mystery Train) and the actress does a very excellent job. In a role such as this, one must consider displaying a certain mental imbalance all the while acting as if there is nothing really amiss with the character. Kudoh is convincing and well carries the film's burden.The past of the deformed courtesan is actually the film's showstopper. The audience will be drawn to the tales of this mysterious woman; layers upon layers of her character will be revealed slowly. The style of its storytelling is actually very effective. Her story as narrated gets more twisted and disturbing as the film progresses. To sum everything up; this is a tale of curses, Karma and betrayals. Komomo is a courtesan with a kind heart and the torture that she underwent exceeds that ones displayed in Miike's ""Audition"". I felt a certain uneasiness as I became privy to her torment but at the same time I could not look away. The violent images of abortion will also be etched in my memory.The direction by Takashi Miike is as solid and competent as ever. I have often said that Miike is a master of visuals and movement; this film displays the usual style that American audiences have grown to love. The camera work is well-executed and the cinematography fits the film's premise. Miike utilizes a lot of colors that represent the film's mood; some scenes have more color than others and shadows are oftentimes utilized. The wind signifies the symbol of change in one's life. The film is VERY DISTURBING, and it is to Miike's credit that he manages to keep a balance between its disturbing images and the film's actual screenplay. I do think the director wanted to keep the cinematography enchanting and mysterious; while the images become more disturbing as it progresses, all the more becoming more seductive. Asian Horror thrives on slow reveal and foreshadowing and this film is no different.The film's final act and the final SINISTER secret may not be wholly original, but Director Miike is smart enough to play on the film's strengths rather than some of it's weaknesses. One other flaw it may have is that Billy Drago's performance does seem a little lackluster. I felt that he was trying a little too hard to convince. His character may come across as a little underdeveloped for the inexperienced movie watcher but not so if you paid attention to the film's entirety. Aside from Kudoh's performance, Michie also shines in her role as Komomo, however limited her screen time might be. I felt nothing but sympathy for her torment.The film is also nicely paced. For a film that clocks in at little over an hour, the film does manage to generate the right scares and mental disgust, but I was left hungering for more; all the more being relieved that the film's depressing story had ended. This is a film that really gets under your skin and emotions, and the less you know, the better the experience would be. Takashi Miike has never disappointed me with his tales of surprising twists and violent imagery and ""IMPRINT"" is no different. Japanese horror may sometimes have the usual motifs of Karma and cursed retribution but after viewing this film, these motifs become quite strong when handled by the right Japanese director such as Takashi Miike. This film is not for the squeamish and those who cannot stand disturbing images.Cruel, full of torment and mind-blowing uneasiness, the film stays enchanting and gripping with its seductive execution.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!
