1376549,A1LV6LMUHV3DNS,B003YOZNC4,"C. Bauer ""buccaneer""","[58, 78]","The four girls of this new series ""Land Girls"" are engaging.  The village is pretty.  The other actors are very good.  But to think this is a real story of those times is to be disillusioned.  First I must protest the terrible portrayal of the ""Home Guard"".  In reality, a group of decent men who served England as the first line of defense on home territory.  Comprised of WW One soldiers and officers, men disabled, men to old or ill to serve in WW2 it is an organization that deserved a better voice in this film than they have received.  In this film the Home Guard soldier in charge in the village where ""Land Girls"" takes place is portrayed as a lunatic.  Putting a dreadful face on a worthy organization.  Shame on the writer.  And how tiresome that once again, the lady of the manor is a bad person, etc. and her husband is a cowardly philanderer.  YAWN!!!  So drop in some AWOL activity, racism, sex, out of wedlock pregnancy, and adultery not to mention hoarding and black market activity.  IN the midst of all this mayhem, is there a war going on?  How about exploring the fact that Britain would have starved without the contributions of the agricultural world of the U.K.  At the beginning of WW2 this country imported nearly all of their food stuffs.  It was the job of land girls not just to take the place of men in war but to help increase the amounts of food to feed a nation at war.  I wonder why the true stories of life during WW2 in England were not enough for this writer.  Any young person might think this ""fiction"" is a genuine portrait of a village in England during war time.  But here at this website one can find many books that have come out in recent years.  The published diaries of hundreds of men and women of all classes who lived in England and lived through this war.  Here is one.  ""Nella Last's War"".  Instead of buying this DVD buy that book.  And like myself, ask this writer why he could not have written a true story of a village at war.  By the way, there are several films some made in the U.K. that give a better portrait of what life was like without the sugar coating of propaganda.  For example, ""The Canterbury Tales"".  It is my sincere hope that this writer tries to create a more honest film next time or give up altogether ""historical fiction"".  I think the next Spiderman movie for example?",1,Who made this thing?

1376555,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B003YOZNC4,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[11, 12]","A DRAMA, not documentary, done expertly by BBC to honor the service women gave in WWII. It takes a rap for changes, such as costume color, but the experience of seeing a stunning filming of a very dramatic portrayal of the times is well worth the liberty taken for the sake of aesthetic license. The spirit of the times and of the ladies is there. There is an episode that shows almost all of the unpleasantries that also goes along with wartime. One episode continues to the next.Of course viewers can recognize that not every soldier and civilian lived a life exactly like the characters of this fictional presentation. One uncaring Yank does not make an army of such. As in the wonderful series ""Foyle's War"", the episodes offer glimpses into the 40's time, and a taste of the home front war. It is sometimes so spectacular in visual imagery that one forgets it is wartime. The acting is spot on. Costumes convincing, sets true. You will be enriched, enlightened, see romance and humor, as well as suffer the losses felt by characters. You will wish for more.UNFORTUNATELY NO SUBTITLES OR CC, or bonus materials.5 Episodes (aired Sep. of 2009) each about 45 min. Each episode advances in time by about 3 months.Childhood's EndThe village of Helmstead changes with the arrival of Joyce and Nancy. Joyce has a new enlisted RAF hubby, Nancy is drafted to the fields. They join Annie and 17-year-old sis Bea at Hoxley Hall, that of Lord Lawrence & Lady Ellen Hoxley. Pasture Farm is also assisted by Frederick Finch and son, Billy. Women's Land Army Girls are overseen by Esther Reeves (her hubby a POW) who has a son with her, Martin. The secondary plot has Yank troops caught up in segregation issues, and one lady-loving Corporal.Secrets- 3 mo laterBea's liaison with a GI gives her unwanted morning illness and the want of a `cure.' Home Guard Tucker searches among land girls and POW hands for a spy, forcing Esther's aid. Lawrence has a lame horse with Joyce helps try to mend. Lord Hoxley is a bit friendlier with the girls, compared to his wife. Secrets abound.Codes of Honour- 6 mo laterLawrence and Nancy like barn lofts. Nancy's secret is uncovered and arrest follows. Old man Finch has his own narrow escape from the law while Joyce and husband, John, risk much for love. Honour comes with differing codes.Trekkers- 9 mo laterFamilies who have been bombed out of their home hit the road (Trekkers). Some join the field help as John returns to duty and Nancy and Lawrence continue their thing. There is more romance afoot, as well as action, resultant of Trekkers. Bea has a big day, while Annie is surprised.Destinies- 12 mo laterA wedding takes place and is attended by unexpected guests. Annie has a choice to make. Lawrence makes his, to leave. As does Nancy. Guns and grenades cause a suspenseful climax, nearly upstaged by romance and sudden circumstances.The saga continues in 5 more episodes airing in January, 2011.1-Back to the Land; 2-Displaced Loyalties; 3-Final Reckoning; 4-Fight the Good Fight; 5-Darkest Hours.Will it take a year for these excellent parts to be offered on DVD? Let's hope not.The only negatives to this HISTORICAL PERIOD FICTION DRAMA are the subtitle absence and wish for more episodes. Remember it's not a documentary. Not a history book.
