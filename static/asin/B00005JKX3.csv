There is not an orginal thought in this movie, basically recycling plot after plot, and retelling plots that were wrapped up in the first one. The voices are terrible, not anything like the orginal-Smee is the ultimate in this regard. The animation is substandard, the computer animation seems out of place and from a video game of the same name, and the songs are GOD AWFUL! I am no musician, but this music makes me want to cringe. Also, to add insult to injury, the makers of this film bring in the themes from the orginal every once in a while to help to remind you that this is a sequal to a much better motion picture.I haven't come to expect much from Disney movies lately. This is a good example of why Disney is a running joke in my household.If you thought Little Mermaid 2, Cinderella 2, Hunchback 2, etc...were just as good as the orginal, then this movie is highly recommended.

592172,A19K5DILM15WU3,B00005JKX3,Alex,"[6, 8]","Disney's straight to video sequels are obviously going downhill. ""Return to Neverland"" was started as a straight to video sequel, but after a close look at the story, Walt Disney Feature Animation decided to give it a higher budget and release it in theaters. The animation was smooth and there were several good computer animation sequences. It really is a clever story picking up from where the original play ends. At the end of the play, Wendy is all grown up with a daughter, Jane. Peter, holding to his promis, comes back for Wendy who can't return to Neverland since she is grown up. So he takes Jane. In the movie, because no one in Neverland has a sense of time, Captain Hook kidnaps Jane mistaking her for Wendy. Peter rescues Jane, but is having an awful time trying to teach Jane how to fly so she can return home. Jane's father has not come back from WW2 and Jane and her brother are going to be placed in a shelter away from their mother. It is a little darker than the original and in no way is better, but it is still good and suitible for the whole family to sit and enjoy.",4,The Best Disney Sequel in A Long Time!,1025395200,"06 30, 2002",2002,1089,"['Disney', 'straight', 'video', 'sequels', 'are', 'obviously', 'going', 'downhill', 'Return', 'Neverland', 'was', 'started', 'straight', 'video', 'sequel', 'close', 'look', 'story', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Feature', 'Animation', 'decided', 'give', 'higher', 'budget', 'release', 'theaters', 'animation', 'was', 'smooth', 'were', 'several', 'good', 'computer', 'animation', 'sequences', 'really', 'clever', 'story', 'picking', 'up', 'where', 'original', 'play', 'end', 'play', 'Wendy', 'grown', 'up', 'daughter', 'Jane', 'Peter', 'holding', 'promis', 'back', 'Wendy', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'return', 'Neverland', 'grown', 'up', 'Jane', 'movie', 'one', 'Neverland', 'sense', 'time', 'Captain', 'Hook', 'Jane', 'mistaking', 'Wendy', 'Peter', 'Jane', 'having', 'awful', 'time', 'trying', 'teach', 'Jane', 'how', 'fly', 'so', 'can', 'return', 'home', 'Jane', 'father', 'not', 'come', 'back', 'WW2', 'Jane', 'brother', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'placed', 'shelter', 'away', 'mother', 'little', 'darker', 'original', 'way', 'better', 'still', 'good', 'suitible', 'whole', 'family', 'sit', 'enjoy']",Peter Pan in Return to Never Land Walt Disney Pictures Presents  VHS
592173,AK0CENM3LUM28,B00005JKX3,Amazon Customer,"[1, 2]","Return to Neverland / B000VE4UBAI like Disney sequels and prequels, I really do. At least sometimes.The Little Mermaid 2andAriel's Beginningwere superb, as well asThe Lion King 2, and each dealt carefully with issues that arose out of the previous movies. Return to Neverland, on the other hand, seems stale, flat, and dull - a soulless retread of the original.The premise was a good one. Wendy's daughter, raised in a much more adult world, one defined by war, has no time for fairy tales. Robbed of a childhood, she is frustrated with her younger brother, and fears that the ""silly nonsense"" in his head may bring him to harm. When she finds herself transported by force into Neverland (in an absolutely eye-rollingly awful scene involving Hook, a flying ship, and a kidnapping scheme gone wrong), she is simply not ready to appreciate the fairy-tale-come-true world she finds herself in. Unfortunately, in order to leave, she must learn how to love Neverland, because only fairy dust (and faith!) will allow her to fly home.With such a promising premise, it's hard to say how this movie went so wrong. The personalities seem to be sucked out of the characters. The Lost Boys are indistinguishable from one another (even more so than in the first movie), which is really just inexcusable when more recent efforts have shown that it doesn't need to be this way. Peter himself has no charm at all, none of the boyish delight that causes people to love him in spite of his faults. Tinkerbell has become a simpering sweet caricature of herself, apparently in preparation for her own movie in which Disney has decided to whitewash her into a sweet little fairy instead of the vibrant miniature woman Barrie imagined her to be. Hook has lost a great deal of character, too - where he was smooth, cruel, and calculating, he is now a bumbling fool and seems more comic relief than genuine menace. Apparently, this was an attempt to ""tone down"" the movie for younger audiences, but I do not believe it was a wise decision. Nor was the ""swap"" from crocodile to octopus, which is just painfully bad to watch.You won't see much of Neverland here. The ""Indian camp"" has been razed to the ground, with nary a soul in sight, presumably because Disney couldn't figure out how to respectfully treat the natives and decided to bypass the issue. Again, more recentPeter Panmovies have managed to do this just fine, so it's a shame that Disney couldn't be bothered. Most of the sets - the mermaid lagoon, the tree house, the beach - fly by in quick succession as the paper-thin story plods along: Jane must be made to learn to relax and ""have fun"" before she can appreciate Neverland, believe in fairies (and save Tinkerbell's life), and go home. (""Faith!! Trust!! And pixie dust!!"" is shouted so often that my teeth began to stand on edge.)I had hoped this would be a pro-female movie, but without the ""perfect princess"" platform that Disney usually relies on. Jane seems a good candidate for a ""just as good as a boy"" type of story where Peter and Jane both realize that they have a lot to learn from each other (even if Peter cannot learn to be serious, he could at least confront his own internal issues with females). No attempt is made at mutual self-discovery, however - Jane is ""taught"" that she needs to lighten up and stop being so serious and that's the end of it. The superficial ""lesson"" leaves the viewer unsatisfied and it would have been better if a little more depth had been expended to highlight the fact that there is a time and a place for both silliness AND seriousness, and that one must be wise to know which is which.This movie is closed captioned for the hearing impaired.~ Ana Mardoll",3,Deeply Stale,1237161600,"03 16, 2009",2009,3693,"['Return', 'Neverland', '/', 'B000VE4UBAI', 'Disney', 'sequels', 'prequels', 'really', 'do', 'least', 'sometimes.The', 'Little', 'Mermaid', '2andAriel', 'Beginningwere', 'superb', 'as', 'well', 'Lion', 'King', '2', 'dealt', 'carefully', 'issues', 'arose', 'previous', 'movies', 'Return', 'Neverland', 'other', 'hand', 'stale', 'flat', 'dull', 'soulless', 'retread', 'original.The', 'premise', 'was', 'good', 'one', 'Wendy', 'daughter', 'raised', 'much', 'more', 'adult', 'world', 'one', 'defined', 'war', 'time', 'fairy', 'tales', 'Robbed', 'childhood', 'frustrated', 'younger', 'brother', 'fears', 'silly', 'nonsense', 'head', 'may', 'bring', 'harm', 'When', 'transported', 'force', 'Neverland', 'absolutely', 'eye-rollingly', 'awful', 'scene', 'involving', 'Hook', 'flying', 'ship', 'kidnapping', 'scheme', 'gone', 'wrong', 'simply', 'not', 'ready', 'appreciate', 'fairy-tale-come-true', 'world', 'Unfortunately', 'order', 'leave', 'must', 'learn', 'how', 'love', 'Neverland', 'only', 'fairy', 'dust', 'faith', 'will', 'allow', 'fly', 'home.With', 'such', 'promising', 'premise', 'hard', 'say', 'how', 'movie', 'went', 'so', 'wrong', 'personalities', 'seem', 'be', 'sucked', 'characters', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'are', 'indistinguishable', 'one', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'first', 'movie', 'really', 'just', 'inexcusable', 'when', 'more', 'recent', 'efforts', 'have', 'shown', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'way', 'Peter', 'charm', 'none', 'boyish', 'delight', 'people', 'love', 'spite', 'faults', 'Tinkerbell', 'become', 'simpering', 'sweet', 'caricature', 'herself', 'apparently', 'preparation', 'own', 'movie', 'Disney', 'decided', 'whitewash', 'sweet', 'little', 'fairy', 'instead', 'vibrant', 'miniature', 'woman', 'Barrie', 'imagined', 'be', 'Hook', 'lost', 'great', 'deal', 'character', 'too', 'where', 'was', 'smooth', 'cruel', 'calculating', 'now', 'bumbling', 'fool', 'more', 'comic', 'relief', 'genuine', 'menace', 'Apparently', 'was', 'attempt', 'tone', 'down', 'movie', 'younger', 'audiences', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'was', 'wise', 'decision', 'was', 'swap', 'crocodile', 'octopus', 'just', 'painfully', 'bad', 'watch.You', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'Neverland', 'here', 'Indian', 'camp', 'been', 'razed', 'ground', 'soul', 'sight', 'presumably', 'Disney', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'respectfully', 'treat', 'natives', 'decided', 'bypass', 'issue', 'Again', 'more', 'recentPeter', 'Panmovies', 'have', 'managed', 'do', 'just', 'fine', 'shame', 'Disney', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'bothered', 'Most', 'sets', 'mermaid', 'lagoon', 'tree', 'house', 'beach', 'fly', 'quick', 'succession', 'paper-thin', 'story', 'plods', 'Jane', 'must', 'be', 'made', 'learn', 'relax', 'have', 'fun', 'can', 'appreciate', 'Neverland', 'believe', 'fairies', 'save', 'Tinkerbell', 'life', 'go', 'home', 'Faith', 'Trust', 'pixie', 'dust', 'shouted', 'so', 'often', 'teeth', 'began', 'stand', 'edge', 'had', 'hoped', 'would', 'be', 'pro-female', 'movie', 'perfect', 'princess', 'platform', 'Disney', 'usually', 'Jane', 'good', 'candidate', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'boy', 'type', 'story', 'where', 'Peter', 'Jane', 'realize', 'have', 'lot', 'learn', 'other', 'even', 'Peter', 'can', 'not', 'learn', 'be', 'serious', 'could', 'least', 'confront', 'own', 'internal', 'issues', 'females', 'attempt', 'made', 'mutual', 'self-discovery', 'however', 'Jane', 'taught', 'lighten', 'up', 'stop', 'being', 'so', 'serious', 'end', 'superficial', 'lesson', 'viewer', 'unsatisfied', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'little', 'more', 'depth', 'had', 'been', 'expended', 'highlight', 'fact', 'time', 'place', 'silliness', 'AND', 'seriousness', 'one', 'must', 'be', 'wise', 'know', 'which.This', 'movie', 'closed', 'captioned', 'hearing', 'impaired.~', 'Ana', 'Mardoll']",Peter Pan in Return to Never Land Walt Disney Pictures Presents  VHS

However, Disney, with it's Direct to video roll, for some odd reason, decided to put this one on the big screen!As an animator myself i can honestly say that this is far below disney's usual standard. The animaton is stiff and akward. The voices of the characters are not even remotely close to the original (especially the lost boys) and Peter Pan himself comes across as nothing more than a brat without his charm that has made him such a beloved icon.Disney is also 'getting with the times' and instead of confrunting and trying to debunk the horrible stereotyped ""injuns,"" the indian camp looks more like they were wiped out and aren't even mentioned in the movie, just to be safe.As for the story, it had a lot going for it. The material was all there, it's just a shame the writers just took whatever came by first. Jane is non-empathetic, and her transition from wanting to grow up to being a kid is very downplayed.This film is much more lighter than the original Peter Pan which was rather dark in places.

592183,A16EFRMJOKEI0B,B00005JKX3,Christopher Wyer,"[3, 6]","First off, I'm 21 years old but still have a place in my heart for cartoons and Disney usually does an excellent job of putting on a good show for both children and adults. This movie fell short by a huge margin. Most animated movies produced in the last 10 years have had something for both children and adults. This one hopes to entertain little kids at best.As plot goes, Disney suceeds in telling the same story that the told in Peter Pan with a few alterations.  The story revolves around a trip from the real world into Neverland and the strange antics that go on there.  Then after a time the main character's decide that they want to go home.  The battles that are fought with Captain Hook take place again in this movie and it comes across as being almost exactly the same.  The characters to struggle to be different from the original Peter Pan. The main thing they did was change the names. Wendy's daughter (Jane) is now the main character.  She is too grown up to believe in Peter Pan which is the only destiguishing aspect of her character.  The other main character change was the alligator.  Now instead of an alligator with a clock in his stomach there is a giant octopus chasing Captain Hook, and he does the exact same things that the alligator did, snapping his suction cups instead of the clock ticking.  The story itself is only differed by the way Jane gets to Neverland, being obducted by Captain Hook, instead of going willingly with Peter.  And the subplot with Tigerlily and the indians isn't included or redone.The music in this movie falls way short of what you'd expect from a full length Disney feature. The oscar winning composers of several Disney movies must have left this one up to the understudies.  The music, while trying to stay true to the original, was matched with lyrics that didn't even fit into the patterns that were played.  And while that sells records for bands like ""System of a Down"" it just didn't work in this movie.  The rhythm of most of the songs was so uneven that it sounded like a 4 year old wrote them. And the Lost Boy song alone made me very anxious for the end credits to come up and I can usually watch a movie two times in a row without getting bored.There really isn't any aspect of this movie that gives me reason to recommend it to adults who might want to see this movie. Something is just missing. My recommendation, watch another Disney movie, like the original Peter Pan or just let the little kids can watch it by themselves while you watch something that has a little more to it.The Breakdown:1. Plot-6 (Same story as original, typical sequel by disney)2. Characters-5 (Same characters as the first, some just in different form)3. Flow-5 (Slow pace, songs dragged a lot)4. Atmosphere-4 (Nothing special, songs actually took away points)5. Animation-5 (Hook's ship was neat but everything else was to simple)6.

This movie has a great storyline and kept up the action of the original with a different storyline and undertone. I never know whether I will like some of the sequels that have come out for the Disney movies, as some have been ok, while others have struggled. I have to say that my family and I enjoyed this one and felt that it added some depth to the main character that you already know and love while adding some new characters to the mix as well.The movie still talks about some of the main topics that have been discussed in the original, particularly, growing up and the battle between youth and adulthood. The movie is fast paced and a lot of fun to watch and enjoy with your family.One of the best parts for me has to be the ending (though there were other good parts too), but the ending was well done and very personal and touching.

592185,A8S11VP9Z36D6,B00005JKX3,"Dave ""Davelandweb""","[5, 5]","I put this movie in the DVD player fully expecting the piece of crap movie that many of the reviews here talk about. After watching it ALL THE WAY THROUGH, I wonder if these reviewers actually watched the whole thing? Granted, it's not the caliber of the original, but it is definitely a more than pleasant family film to enjoy together with the children. The positives: the animation and backgrounds really amazed me; the characterization of Tinker Bell is especially faithful to the original. At times, the backgrounds slip into an almost too-perfect computer generated look, but overall, the animation is very good and better than what you normally see. Kudos also to the voices, especially the one of Captain Hook, who (again) is very faithful to the original. The story is also quite good; somewhat predictable, but definitely different enough to separate it from the original. I enjoyed the homage to the Mary Martin TV series (believing in Fairies/Tinkerbell getting weak) and the feistiness of the Jane character. The beginning of the film owes a little to the Narnia series, as it is set during the war when children were being shipped off for their own protection. Once in Neverland, it is back to fantasy and the realities of the war are not really dealt with again. The negatives are few; my biggest gripe is the potty/gross-out humor that I feel mars the film. The powers that be seem to be fascinated with snot; I could definitely do without the constant visual reference to this body fluid. In general, what this film really lacks is a strong plot-mover. It is entertaining, but not riveting; at no time would it be difficult to stop the movie and get a snack, makting this a great DVD to watch, but definitely not a movie to run to the theater to watch. The DVD itself has some nice extras; a few deleted scenes with commentary by the show's production team. There are also a few sneak peaks for the upcoming Tinkerbell movie (Tink looks better in traditional animation; not too swift in computer 3D style) and the obligatory game, ""Quest for the Light."" Overall, a good film to watch with the kids that is above the level of most of what's out there; if you are attempting to compare it to the original though, you will be slightly disappointed.",3,Review for Pixie Powered Edition,1195862400,"11 24, 2007",2007,2262,"['put', 'movie', 'DVD', 'player', 'fully', 'expecting', 'piece', 'crap', 'movie', 'many', 'reviews', 'here', 'talk', 'watching', 'WAY', 'THROUGH', 'wonder', 'reviewers', 'actually', 'watched', 'whole', 'thing', 'Granted', 'not', 'caliber', 'original', 'definitely', 'more', 'pleasant', 'family', 'film', 'enjoy', 'together', 'children', 'positives', 'animation', 'backgrounds', 'really', 'characterization', 'Tinker', 'Bell', 'especially', 'faithful', 'original', 'times', 'backgrounds', 'slip', 'almost', 'too-perfect', 'computer', 'generated', 'look', 'overall', 'animation', 'very', 'good', 'better', 'what', 'normally', 'see', 'Kudos', 'also', 'voices', 'especially', 'one', 'Captain', 'Hook', 'who', 'again', 'very', 'faithful', 'original', 'story', 'also', 'quite', 'good', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'definitely', 'different', 'enough', 'separate', 'original', 'enjoyed', 'homage', 'Mary', 'Martin', 'TV', 'series', 'believing', 'Fairies/Tinkerbell', 'getting', 'weak', 'feistiness', 'Jane', 'character', 'beginning', 'film', 'little', 'Narnia', 'series', 'set', 'war', 'when', 'children', 'were', 'being', 'shipped', 'own', 'protection', 'Once', 'Neverland', 'back', 'fantasy', 'realities', 'war', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'dealt', 'again', 'negatives', 'are', 'few', 'biggest', 'gripe', 'potty/gross-out', 'humor', 'feel', 'mars', 'film', 'powers', 'be', 'seem', 'be', 'fascinated', 'snot', 'could', 'definitely', 'do', 'constant', 'visual', 'reference', 'body', 'fluid', 'general', 'what', 'film', 'really', 'strong', 'plot-mover', 'entertaining', 'not', 'riveting', 'time', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'stop', 'movie', 'get', 'snack', 'makting', 'great', 'DVD', 'watch', 'definitely', 'not', 'movie', 'run', 'theater', 'watch', 'DVD', 'nice', 'extras', 'few', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'commentary', 'show', 'production', 'team', 'are', 'also', 'few', 'sneak', 'peaks', 'upcoming', 'Tinkerbell', 'movie', 'Tink', 'better', 'traditional', 'animation', 'not', 'too', 'swift', 'computer', '3D', 'style', 'obligatory', 'game', 'Quest', 'Light', 'Overall', 'good', 'film', 'watch', 'kids', 'level', 'most', 'what', 'out', 'there', 'are', 'attempting', 'compare', 'original', 'will', 'be', 'slightly', 'disappointed']",Peter Pan in Return to Never Land Walt Disney Pictures Presents  VHS

592192,A3P0KI3M51LI01,B00005JKX3,Gregory Masciola,"[3, 3]","Where do I begin?  Disney has again put out another lousy sequel to a great classic.  I never had high expectations for this movie when I decided to rent it, so I guess it was just a little bit better than I expected, but I still think it is a pretty dumb movie.I won't waste my time summarizing the movie, so I'll just try to tell you what I liked and what I didn't like about it.What I liked was most of the animation of this movie.  The style of the background art seemed to stay true to the original movie from the 1950s, although there was quite a bit of CGI used throughout the film.  Really, the animation was the only thing that I liked.What I didn't like about the movie:1. The ScriptThe dialogue of this movie is so boring to me.  A child in grade school could have written a better script than this one.  It seems like someone just made a rough draft and they just said, ""Yeah, we'll just use that,"" instead of taking any time to make it better.  Most Disney films are made for KIDS, but this one seems like it was just made for babies (who would probably also find it pretty boring).  In the first movie, while Peter was a kid, he was also very brave and clever.  In this movie, he just seems stupid.2. The MusicThere are absolutley no good songs in this movie.  The song about the lost boys is horrible.3. VoicesObviously, when you do a sequel to a movie that is over 50 years old, many of the original actors are either dead or too old to reprise their roles, so new people must be found.  With several characters, I feel that they made the wrong choice of actor.  For example, the chubby lost boy who they call Cubby in this movie has a voice that is nowhere near the original voice.  I feel that they should find people who can come close to doing the old voice and go with the person who does it best.  Otherwise the voice doesn't fit the character.  The person who did the voice of Smee sounded very much like the original, though.So basically, this movie was a waste of time to me.  It could have been a very good sequal, but Disney just decided not to put any real effort into it, which is why it falls very short.

""Return to Never Land"" is a cute little follow-up to Peter Pan although it doesn't stand up to the original.  It involves the spunky daughter of Wendy, Peter's heartthrob from umpteen years ago.  I missed the crocodile, but the kids got a big kick out of the octopus.  My wife and I saw it in the theater when it was first released.  At first, I thought we'd be surrounded by screaming brats.  There was a surprising number of kidless adults there, and the kids present gave no problems once the movie started.

That said, some sequels are better than others and this is one of the better ones.  I think this movie was very good mainly because it didn't ""re-do"" the original story in reverse (like Lady & the Tranp 2 or Little Mermaid 2) or try to lamely continue the old one (Cinderella 2, Jungle Book 2).  This is a new story with a new heroine, and stands on its own merits.Wendy's daughter doesn't believe.  She has had to grow up fast in a world where her father is off to war and London is under seige.  So when Captain Hook kidnaps her thinking she is Wendy, she needs to learn how to believe again.

592201,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B00005JKX3,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[2, 2]","Walt Disney's production of J.M. Barrie's wonderful ""Peter Pan"" gets a whole new chapter with ""Return To Neverland.""  In this tale, a grown-up Wendy and her husband (who's been shipped off to war) are raising two young children in WWII London.  As she promised him in the original film, Wendy has never forgotten Peter Pan and she tells her children of his many adventures.  Young Daniel finds comfort in these tales as London is being bombed through the night.  Jane thinks such stories are rubbish and only for little kids.  She does not believe.In an attempt to catch Peter once and for all, Captain Hook shows up in London the night before Jane and Daniel are to be sent to the country for protection and steals Jane mistaking her for Wendy.  When Jane arrives in Neverland, she must come to terms with this fantasy-turned-reality in order to save herself, the Lost Boys and little Tinkerbell.Diehard fans of the first film (adults in particular) will likely pick this film apart for any and every imperfection or diversion from the original tale.  Fear not, faithful fans, this film doesn't try to remake the original.  It's a good story in its own right.  The animation is excellent, although the CG animation stands out a bit too much at moments.  There's little in the way of songs and there are no Indians or crocs to be seen.  Still, this is a fun tale that I'm sure the whole family will enjoy.The DVD is very good.  As always, Disney has loaded this disc up with plenty of previews,as well as a Tinker Bell game, deleted scenes and a preview of the Disney ""Fairies"" collection.This is a nice sequel.  It doesn't quite measure up to ""Cinderella Three:  A Twist In Time,"" but it is one of the better sequels that Disney has produced.  It's always tough to top the original of any film series, and especially a Disney original.  With that said, I give ""Return To Neverland"" a solid recommendation.",4,"Faith, Trust and...Ah, You Know How It Goes",1211760000,"05 26, 2008",2008,1906,"['Walt', 'Disney', 'production', 'J.M', 'Barrie', 'wonderful', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'whole', 'new', 'chapter', 'Return', 'Neverland', 'tale', 'grown-up', 'Wendy', 'husband', 'who', 'been', 'shipped', 'war', 'are', 'raising', 'two', 'young', 'children', 'WWII', 'London', 'promised', 'original', 'film', 'Wendy', 'never', 'forgotten', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'children', 'many', 'adventures', 'Young', 'Daniel', 'comfort', 'tales', 'London', 'being', 'bombed', 'night', 'Jane', 'thinks', 'such', 'stories', 'are', 'rubbish', 'only', 'little', 'kids', 'not', 'believe.In', 'attempt', 'catch', 'Peter', 'once', 'Captain', 'Hook', 'up', 'London', 'night', 'Jane', 'Daniel', 'are', 'be', 'sent', 'country', 'protection', 'steals', 'Jane', 'mistaking', 'Wendy', 'When', 'Jane', 'Neverland', 'must', 'come', 'terms', 'fantasy-turned-reality', 'order', 'save', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'little', 'Tinkerbell.Diehard', 'fans', 'first', 'film', 'adults', 'particular', 'will', 'likely', 'pick', 'film', 'apart', 'imperfection', 'diversion', 'original', 'tale', 'Fear', 'not', 'faithful', 'fans', 'film', ""n't"", 'try', 'remake', 'original', 'good', 'story', 'own', 'right', 'animation', 'excellent', 'CG', 'animation', 'out', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'moments', 'little', 'way', 'songs', 'are', 'Indians', 'crocs', 'be', 'seen', 'Still', 'fun', 'tale', ""'m"", 'sure', 'whole', 'family', 'will', 'enjoy.The', 'DVD', 'very', 'good', 'always', 'Disney', 'loaded', 'up', 'plenty', 'previews', 'as', 'well', 'Tinker', 'Bell', 'game', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'preview', 'Disney', 'Fairies', 'collection.This', 'nice', 'sequel', ""n't"", 'quite', 'measure', 'up', 'Cinderella', 'Three', 'Twist', 'Time', 'one', 'better', 'sequels', 'Disney', 'produced', 'always', 'tough', 'top', 'original', 'film', 'series', 'especially', 'Disney', 'original', 'said', 'give', 'Return', 'Neverland', 'solid', 'recommendation']",Peter Pan in Return to Never Land Walt Disney Pictures Presents  VHS

In the original novel, after Wendy has grown up, Peter returns to meet her daughter Jane.  I was very excited about this movie.The movie begins as if it will be truly as magical as the original, and as appealing to children as to adults - which is part of the magic of Peter Pan.  The film takes place during WWII as London is being bombed.  Jane is the older child of grown-up Wendy.  Jane's father is off to war.  Jane's brother thrills to Wendy's tales of Neverland and Peter Pan.  Jane, however, does not believe in such ""childish nonsense.""  So here we have a great story - a child who does not believe in Peter Pan!  She must be saved from becoming a grown up!  Hook comes to kidnap Jane, thinking she is Wendy.  Then viewers are thrilled by a stunning opening sequence of Hook's flying pirate ship soaring over London among WWII fighter planes.Unfortunately, the film climaxes here, just as it is beginning.  The rest of the film is mostly silly slapstick stuff.  Oh, Captain Hook has heart underwear - that is so FUNNY!  Jane becomes a kid just by skipping over some rocks.  The film is not so much a return to Neverland, because the rest of the movie is all action between the Lost Boys and the pirates.  Where is the exploration of the magical land?  The Indians? The mermaids?The appeal to adults returns briefly at the end with a touching reunion between Wendy and Peter.So this movie is great for kids - but only after they have seen the original.",3,"""Return"" Tries, But Falls Short",1127520000,"09 24, 2005",2005,1572,"['was', 'wonderful', 'idea', 'make', 'sequel', 'can', 'call', 'film', 'sequel', 'fifty', 'years', 'later', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'original', 'novel', 'Wendy', 'grown', 'up', 'Peter', 'meet', 'daughter', 'Jane', 'was', 'very', 'excited', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'truly', 'as', 'magical', 'original', 'appealing', 'children', 'adults', 'part', 'magic', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'film', 'place', 'WWII', 'London', 'being', 'bombed', 'Jane', 'older', 'child', 'grown-up', 'Wendy', 'Jane', 'father', 'war', 'Jane', 'brother', 'thrills', 'Wendy', 'tales', 'Neverland', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'Jane', 'however', 'not', 'believe', 'such', 'childish', 'nonsense', 'So', 'here', 'have', 'great', 'story', 'child', 'who', 'not', 'believe', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'must', 'be', 'saved', 'becoming', 'grown', 'up', 'Hook', 'kidnap', 'Jane', 'thinking', 'Wendy', 'Then', 'viewers', 'are', 'thrilled', 'stunning', 'opening', 'sequence', 'Hook', 'flying', 'pirate', 'ship', 'soaring', 'London', 'WWII', 'fighter', 'planes.Unfortunately', 'film', 'climaxes', 'here', 'just', 'beginning', 'rest', 'film', 'mostly', 'silly', 'slapstick', 'stuff', 'Oh', 'Captain', 'Hook', 'heart', 'underwear', 'so', 'FUNNY', 'Jane', 'kid', 'just', 'skipping', 'over', 'rocks', 'film', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'return', 'Neverland', 'rest', 'movie', 'action', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'pirates', 'Where', 'exploration', 'magical', 'land', 'Indians', 'mermaids', 'appeal', 'adults', 'returns', 'briefly', 'end', 'touching', 'reunion', 'Wendy', 'Peter.So', 'movie', 'great', 'kids', 'only', 'have', 'seen', 'original']",Peter Pan in Return to Never Land Walt Disney Pictures Presents  VHS

Oh, they tried to change things up some.  And Jane's journey from cynic to faith is fun.  But the Hook/Peter battles felt all too familiar.  And the octopus filled in way too much for the crocodile, right down to the unexplained jerky ticking movements.The animation was done in the old style, and I liked it.  It wasn't flashy most of the time, but it felt like a continuation of the original.

Return to Never Land was supposed to be a direct to video release. Gone in this movie is the crocodile and in this time is a giant octopus. It is hard to tell what time line the movie is set in; the military planes and jeeps looks to be World War II era, but the military and civilian clothing looks World War I. Wendy is now grown up and is married and has a daughter named Jane and a son named Danny. Jane is eleven and Danny is four years old. Jane no longer believes in the stories of Peter Pan as told by her mother. Jane has become sort of a tomboy and somewhat mature since her dad went off to war. During one evening Jane is kidnapped by Captain Hook and his band of pirates and taken to Never Land; Captain Hook thinks he has captured Wendy. Jane is rescues by Peter Pan and is taken to where he and the Lost Boys live. Peter Pan assumes that she is Wendy's daughter that she too would like to become a mother to the Lost Boys. The only thing Jane want to do is to go back to London, but the only way to leave Never Land is to learn how to fly. Jane tells off Peter Pan, the Lost Boys and tells Tinker Bell that fairies are not real. When Tinker Bell hears this, she begins to loose her powers. She leaves the home of Peter Pan and tries to get back to London on her but fails. She eventually meets up with Captain Hook and he strikes up a deal with her. Jane must locate Captain Hook's stolen treasure and in return he will take her back to London. Jane agrees to this and Hook gives her a whistle to blow when she finds the treasure. Jane goes looking for Peter Pan and the Lost Boys while Peter Pan and the Lost Boys goes looking for Jane so they can get her to believe in fairies and make Tinker Bell well again. They all run into each other and Jane suggest they play a game called treasure hunt. Jane does find the treasure but throws the whistle away. Peter Pan and the Lost Boys make Jane the first Lost Girl and while doing so Tootles find the whistle and blows it; not knowing he just alerted Captain Hook and his band of pirates. Captain Hook and his band of pirates take Peter Pan and the Lost Boys back to his ship to die. Jane hurries back to Tinker Bell, but it is too late. This is where the movie goes down hill. While Jane is sobbing away because she believes she arrived too late, Tinker Bell regains her powers and comes back to life. If you notice in the movie, Jane never did say at Tinker Bell's death bed that she believed in furies. In the end Jane rescues Peter Pan and the Lost Boys, Captain Hook and his crew are defeated and are seen fleeing for their lives from the giant octopus, Jane returns home to London, and Peter Pan is reunited with Wendy.The movie was good until it got to the death bed scene and the writers just could not come up with a better ending. This does not live up to its original Peter Pan movie and in my opinion this is why Disney should not do sequels. With the exception of the Rescuers Down Under, no other Disney sequel has ever lived up to the original.

592214,A329U9CDUPKXAC,B00005JKX3,Patrick,"[1, 3]","I am VERY critical of Disney these days. They have turned out so much junk over the past several years that it is criminal. Mainly these sequels of their classics. Such complete failures are The Little Mermaid 2, Cinderella 2, Aladdin 2, Aladdin 3, The Hunchback Of Notre Dame 2, Pocahontas 2 ect. So when I heard a sequel to Peter Pan was coming out I rolled my eyes and prepared for another poor excuse for a movie. To my surprise, Return to Neverland is not only good, but I actually liked it better than the original movie! I can't believe I actually said that! And to think I LOVED Peter Pan was I was younger. This movie has beautiful animation, a pretty decent story, and nice voice acting. My only complaint is the voice of Peter. His voice is WAY too young sounding to fit his character model. Peter has the body of a teenager 15-16 years old. He's slightly more muscular in this than the original. And yet he sounds like he's 8 years old. Another downer is that Peter hasn't matured any. I know he doesn't age any in Neverland but sometimes he just get annoying with his childish antics. He looks too old to be such a brat. The music in this movie is also not so good.

When they at last released a sequal, one strong enough to release to theatres instead of directly to video, I WAS ecstatic.  Although this movie was directed more at kids than adults than the first one, I still enjoyed it very much.The animation is gorgeous.  That is the film's biggest plus.  Disney went all out to create a Neverland by today's standards, increasing on the beauty of the original that, in the widescreen theatre I attended, was perfect enough to dazzle my eyes.  I felt I was flying along with them as they soared.Plotwise, even though it is somewhat thinner than the original Peter Pan (hence four stars instead of five) there are very intense emotional moments that seared itself into my brain.  I have almost never cried at a movie before but this one had tears in my eyes at times.  I forsee this as a classic in the making.  They did a wonderful job.Captain Hook was a slight disappointment, but the humor surrounding him was funny enough (at least, for kids) to almost make up for it.  I tend to see him as more of a side character than in the first one, and the main point, having Jane rediscover her child within amidst WWII, being more of the focus.I really enjoyed how the Lost Boys played a bigger part in this, as well.  They spoke more and had more intelligence, though they were still funny.I definetly reccomend this DVD to anyone when it comes out.

592223,AGRR05FH945HR,B00005JKX3,Steven Cain,"[7, 8]","After the Williams/Spielberg ""Hook"" fiasco, I wondered if even Disney could actually pull of a worthy sequel to their classic Peter Pan movie. I needn't have worried. Almost fifty years on, Return To Never Land fully recaptures the magic of the original.One reason this works so well is that the modern animators have remained true to the original character and set designs. Add to this an inspired piece of voice casting, which was essential and entirely successful in the Hook, Pan and Smee characters, and you have a fairly seamless continuation of the classic story.There are a few minor technical glitches, such as Wendy taking her son to the ""bomb shelter"" instead of the ""air raid shelter"" or ""Anderson shelter"", the appearance of Stuka dive bombers on a night raid, and the emergency vehicles using a type of siren that did not appear in Britain until the sixties. Still, this hardly detracts from what is a first class piece of entertainment.The animation is superb throughout and at times, simply breathtaking, especially the aerial sequences and the arrival of Hook's ship. On the heels of the utterly superb Atlantis: The Lost Empire, Return To Never Land is yet another example of Disney stamping their authority on the world of animation.The modern touches also work well in the mix, such as when Hook's ship passes through a mandala-laden stargate to reach the Never Land. The directions, ""second star to the right and straight on till morning"" were probably an allusion to Sirius, which was suspected of being a binary (twin) star even at the time of the original Peter Pan book.I know some people were disappointed with the movie and I respect their opinions, but for me, it worked brilliantly, and the soundtrack contains some classic songs. My youngest daughter watched it four times in a row upon getting it home (we bought it this morning - the release date for Canada) and she's normally a pretty stern critic of anything ""average"".A breathtaking first fifteen minutes and a beautiful ending sandwiching a highly entertaining middle section.

592225,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B00005JKX3,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[0, 0]","As good as the original if not better, Peter Pan in Return to Neverland is a surprisingly befitting sequel to one of the most popular of Disney's animated features. Featuring familiar faces and a touch of more mature themes, including a setting of war-torn London, this more thrilling adventure finds the daughter of Wendy being kidnapped by the ruthless pirate Captain James Hook (we always wanted to know his first name). Astounding animation and excellent voice acting provides for a highly entertaining sequel - which is certainly a rarity when it comes to animated features.Wendy is all grown up and now has a family of her own. Her husband is away at war, and her young daughter Jane is supposed to look after the family, which also consists of little brother Daniel and the dog, Nana 2 (apparently Nana didn't live long enough to make the sequel). When a government decree is ordered to ship all the children off to the countryside for safekeeping, Jane is distraught at having to leave the family and annoyed at continually hearing about the adventures of Peter Pan. The stories from Wendy sooth little Daniel, but Jane is far too mature for such nonsense. When Captain Hook appears in London, he kidnaps Jane, mistaking her for Wendy, and brings her to Neverland to lure Pan. The high-flying adventurer quickly rescues her, only to realize that she's a bit too adult to have much fun in Neverland. Hook doesn't give up easily and returns to trick Jane into helping him capture Peter Pan and the Lost Boys once and for all.It's an interesting and perhaps risky decision for the creators to choose a setting of presumably World War II in wartime London as bombs rattle homes and streets. It's a choice that actually works quite well to complement Jane's decidedly mature outlook on life and the fictitious Peter Pan. Things as childish as Peter Pan are discarded by Jane, although she secretly seems to wish she could be as carefree and fun-loving as both Daniel and Wendy and the stories they dwell on. And until Hook actually shows up, they are indeed just stories, of which she believes to be completely fabricated for Daniel's benefit. The first portion of the film would make a fine beginning for a live-action movie, as would much of the swashbuckling events later on.Once again the animation is of the highest quality. Although shadows are typically done with less detail on animated films that don't go to theaters (this film was created by Disney's TV animation team), the character designs, movements and especially squash and scratch secondary movements are nearly unequaled. Some CG animation makes an appearance early on, primarily with Captain Hook's ship The Jolly Roger, but as with most of Disney's later feature-length films, they do a satisfactory job of blending it into the traditional.The chirpy songs of the original are curiously absent, save for a single tune from the Lost Boys, and are instead replaced with somber melodies and music played in the background. This actually creates a more refreshingly serious tone - perhaps Return to Neverland's strongest feature is its unexpected seriousness. In the original film, everyone took Peter Pan and his existence for granted - here it is more emotional and realistic to see Jane struggling to believe in the fairytale world (and fairies at all, which causes Tinkerbell's light to dim) even as she interacts with its many amazing wonders.The story is actually better crafted than the original, although J.M. Barrie's timeless tale will doubtlessly always win over the general vote, and Return to Neverland measures up to its predecessor admirably in every other aspect. Having all the elements that make a great animated feature, Peter Pan in Return to Neverland is one of the finest projects to come from the overabundance of sequels from Disney.- Mike Massie",4,Peter Pan Return to Neverland Movie Review,1198108800,"12 20, 2007",2007,3840,"['As', 'good', 'original', 'not', 'better', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'Return', 'Neverland', 'surprisingly', 'befitting', 'sequel', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'Disney', 'animated', 'features', 'Featuring', 'familiar', 'touch', 'more', 'mature', 'themes', 'including', 'setting', 'war-torn', 'London', 'more', 'thrilling', 'adventure', 'daughter', 'Wendy', 'being', 'kidnapped', 'ruthless', 'pirate', 'Captain', 'James', 'Hook', 'always', 'wanted', 'know', 'first', 'name', 'Astounding', 'animation', 'excellent', 'voice', 'acting', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'sequel', 'certainly', 'rarity', 'when', 'animated', 'features.Wendy', 'grown', 'up', 'now', 'family', 'own', 'husband', 'away', 'war', 'young', 'daughter', 'Jane', 'supposed', 'look', 'family', 'also', 'little', 'brother', 'Daniel', 'dog', 'Nana', '2', 'apparently', 'Nana', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'long', 'enough', 'make', 'sequel', 'When', 'government', 'decree', 'ordered', 'ship', 'children', 'countryside', 'safekeeping', 'Jane', 'distraught', 'having', 'leave', 'family', 'annoyed', 'continually', 'hearing', 'adventures', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'stories', 'Wendy', 'little', 'Daniel', 'Jane', 'far', 'too', 'mature', 'such', 'nonsense', 'When', 'Captain', 'Hook', 'London', 'Jane', 'mistaking', 'Wendy', 'Neverland', 'lure', 'Pan', 'high-flying', 'adventurer', 'quickly', 'only', 'realize', 'bit', 'too', 'adult', 'have', 'much', 'fun', 'Neverland', 'Hook', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'easily', 'returns', 'trick', 'Jane', 'helping', 'capture', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'once', 'all.It', 'interesting', 'perhaps', 'risky', 'decision', 'creators', 'choose', 'setting', 'presumably', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'wartime', 'London', 'bombs', 'rattle', 'homes', 'streets', 'choice', 'actually', 'quite', 'well', 'complement', 'Jane', 'decidedly', 'mature', 'outlook', 'life', 'fictitious', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'Things', 'as', 'childish', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'are', 'discarded', 'Jane', 'secretly', 'wish', 'could', 'be', 'carefree', 'fun-loving', 'Daniel', 'Wendy', 'stories', 'dwell', 'Hook', 'actually', 'up', 'are', 'indeed', 'just', 'stories', 'be', 'completely', 'fabricated', 'Daniel', 'benefit', 'first', 'portion', 'film', 'would', 'make', 'fine', 'beginning', 'live-action', 'movie', 'would', 'much', 'swashbuckling', 'events', 'later', 'on.Once', 'again', 'animation', 'highest', 'quality', 'shadows', 'are', 'typically', 'done', 'less', 'detail', 'animated', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'theaters', 'film', 'was', 'created', 'Disney', 'TV', 'animation', 'team', 'character', 'designs', 'movements', 'especially', 'squash', 'scratch', 'secondary', 'movements', 'are', 'nearly', 'unequaled', 'CG', 'animation', 'appearance', 'early', 'primarily', 'Captain', 'Hook', 'ship', 'Jolly', 'Roger', 'most', 'Disney', 'later', 'feature-length', 'films', 'do', 'satisfactory', 'job', 'blending', 'traditional.The', 'chirpy', 'songs', 'original', 'are', 'curiously', 'absent', 'save', 'single', 'tune', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'are', 'instead', 'replaced', 'somber', 'melodies', 'music', 'played', 'background', 'actually', 'more', 'refreshingly', 'serious', 'tone', 'perhaps', 'Return', 'Neverland', 'strongest', 'feature', 'unexpected', 'seriousness', 'original', 'film', 'everyone', 'took', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'existence', 'granted', 'here', 'more', 'emotional', 'realistic', 'see', 'Jane', 'struggling', 'believe', 'fairytale', 'world', 'fairies', 'Tinkerbell', 'light', 'dim', 'even', 'many', 'amazing', 'wonders.The', 'story', 'actually', 'better', 'crafted', 'original', 'J.M', 'Barrie', 'timeless', 'tale', 'will', 'doubtlessly', 'always', 'win', 'general', 'vote', 'Return', 'Neverland', 'up', 'predecessor', 'admirably', 'other', 'aspect', 'Having', 'elements', 'make', 'great', 'animated', 'feature', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'Return', 'Neverland', 'one', 'finest', 'projects', 'come', 'overabundance', 'sequels', 'Disney.-', 'Mike', 'Massie']",Peter Pan in Return to Never Land Walt Disney Pictures Presents  VHS
592226,A7OBFVHNJGI2A,B00005JKX3,Timothy Hulsey,"[2, 7]","Neverland?  More like ""Never again.""A lackluster effort churned out by Disney's television animation team (and seemingly written by a computer), _Return to Neverland_ still managed to dredge up decent box office from movie-starved families back in February 2002.Of course, _Return_ plays shamelessly on boomers' fond memories of Disney's _Peter Pan_ (itself a thoroughly gutted adaptation of J.M. Barrie's stage play).  But for some reason that I cannot fathom let alone explain, _Return_ consistently sabotages the light-hearted tone that made the first film at least palatable, if not especially distinguished.Parents be warned: _Return to Neverland_ is a very SERIOUS children's film.  If one were to judge by this sequel, one would suspect that the original playwright was not J.M. Barrie, but Ibsen or Chekhov.  So what the deuce was Der Maushaus thinking?  With an unlikable sourpuss for a heroine, terrifying scenes of the London blitz, and the lingering near-death of a major character, no one has any fun in Neverland this time around.Even a generous dollop of pixie dust in the third act can't keep this film from crashing and burning.

592227,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JKX3,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 2]","&quot;Return to Neverland&quot; has been released recently in Japan more unceremoniously as &quot;Peter Pan 2&quot;, and for all this uninviting alternate title the film is not a commercial flop.  Japanese distributors might give heartfelt thanks for the brand name of Disney.The plot is so simple, being summerized in the original title, but it is given a twist.  This time, not Wendy, but her daughter Jane goes, or returns, to Neverland, kidnapped by Captain Hook and his men.  And Jane is not a girl who could easily believe in fairy tales, but her cynical quality causes another trouble in Neverland after she is saved by Peter Pan and the Lost Boys.  Oh, and lovely Tinker Bell appears again.Adults would be quick to find out the flaw of the film, which was originally to be released as a video; that is the very thin story.  Actually, its running time is slightly more than 70 minutes, and even with the inclusion of a delightful short film &quot;Pluto's Fledgling&quot;, we still doubt the necessity of its theatrical release.  In fact, everything is given too short time; new character such as Tick-tock Octopus is funny, but not fully used: The Lost Boys are there, but have little to do: the descriptions of Wendy/Jane's family are minimal as if making a parody of Hollywood tradition -- two kids, one daughter and one oy, a dog, father is away and mother at home etc..  But the most regrettable is Tinker Bell, who could have been more intriguing  existence in Neverland.  Being envious of Jane's presence, lovely Tink tries to dismiss Jane back to human's world, and her action is more interesting than that of ever-young Peter Pan or one-note Captain Hook.  How come they decided to treat her that way?The visual of the film is first-rate with good character and production designs.  But it is Disney, you know, and that does not come as surprise.  After watching this film, which is not a disappointment, I admit, I still was wondering why the studio gave it a theatrical release.  The film is much better than ill-fated production such as Spielberg's &quot;Hook&quot; -- no kids get hurt -- and I believe parents can hand over a copy of this film without worry.  But as animation film fan, looking at the hit-or-miss releases of Disney such as &quot;Atlantis&quot;, &quot;Lilo and Stitch&quot;, and &quot;Treasure Planet&quot; (I do not say which is &quot;hit&quot; because you already know that), I start to worry about the future of this celebrated studio, which is clearly eclipsed by the advent of other newer companies like Pixar.",3,"Well, Not Bad, But ...
