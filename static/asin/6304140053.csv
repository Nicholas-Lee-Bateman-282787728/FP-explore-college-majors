403735,A22IK3I6U76GX0,6304140053,Calle,"[5, 6]","I liked director Steven Schachter's TV movie ""The Con"" very much so when this movie was on TV, I decided to see if it was as good as that one. It was. It's about Dempsey, a policeman, who gets shot and, as a result of this, paralyzed in his legs. He gets depressed and the fact that his wife and his brother have an affair doesn't make things better (it's sad and ironic that Christopher Reeve actually got paralyzed not long after this movie was finished).The movie has a good story, I won't tell you too much and spoil it for you, and all of the actors are very good. The movie was co-written by William H. Macy who also appears in a small part (he also co-wrote ""The Con""). It works well both as a good thriller and as a drama.

403738,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,6304140053,Craig Connell,"[0, 0]","This is a pretty interesting crime movie that has been overshadowed by the irony of it: Christopher Reeve playing a man in a wheelchair, and he himself being paralyzed not long after this movie.This story concerns a cop who gets paralyzed and then gets revenge on his wife and brother, both of whom were having an affair behind his back which he knew about. Joe Mantegna's role, I thought, was the best, as the pursuing cop on the case, although Reeve is very good, too. Kim Cattrall's garbage-mouth helps make her a convincing villain as the cheating wife.There is one major credibility problem, however, with this film that might have you shaking your head. You'll have to check to movie to know what I mean, because I don't want to spoil it here. The film is a worth a look, however - definitely recommended.

Ms Cattrall proves that nudity properly employed serves to contribute to the plot rather than distract you from it. Mantegna has to handle the old cliche role: &quot;I'm a better cop than college-trained Christopher because I'm a street cop.&quot;  He does a top drawer job of keeping the &quot;street cop&quot; role on balance.  I thoroughly enjoy a movie when the writing is good.  In ABOVE SUSPCION the writing was good . . . super . . . the very best suspense entertainment.
