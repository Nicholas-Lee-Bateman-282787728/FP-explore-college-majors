It's curious because by the times of 1955 is remarkable how both doctors, patients and everybody smokes a lot everywhere, something today would be politically incorrect. Furthermore, these physicians are good for all: they operate an open heart and in the following minute they attend to a labor and give a baby to light, vaccinate the people, etc. I think there are some excess in that sense, and perhaps a film in color would be more appropriate for these theme, for the blood, etc. The little village Greenville when Mitchum works is also a little blurred, but the whole is a non fully perfect but very good film.",4,"doctor, good cigarettes and bad women are bad for you",1046217600,"02 26, 2003",2003,946,"['movie', 'very', 'good', 'owing', 'big', 'amount', 'stars', 'best', 'moment', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'Sinatra', 'Olivia', 'de', 'Havilland', 'too', 'much', 'humble', 'physically', 'made', 'ugly', 'think', 'Swedes', 'have', 'USA', 'image', 'purity', 'hard', 'working', 'innocence', 'perhaps', 'little', 'exaggerated', 'here', 'Gloria', 'Grahame', 'truly', 'beautiful', 'superb', 'curious', 'times', '1955', 'remarkable', 'how', 'doctors', 'patients', 'everybody', 'lot', 'everywhere', 'something', 'today', 'would', 'be', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'Furthermore', 'physicians', 'are', 'good', 'operate', 'open', 'heart', 'following', 'minute', 'attend', 'labor', 'give', 'baby', 'light', 'vaccinate', 'people', 'etc', 'think', 'are', 'excess', 'sense', 'perhaps', 'film', 'color', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'appropriate', 'theme', 'blood', 'etc', 'little', 'village', 'Greenville', 'when', 'Mitchum', 'also', 'little', 'blurred', 'whole', 'non', 'fully', 'perfect', 'very', 'good', 'film']",N/A

139579,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,0792837991,Dr. James Gardner,"[3, 5]","How can you go wrong with a Stanley Kramer film with Olivia DeHavilland, Robert Mitchum, Frank Sinatra, Gloria Grahame, Broderick Crawford, Charles Bickford, Lee Marvin, Lon Chaney Jr, Harry Morgan, and Mae Clarke? Watch ""Not as a Stranger"" and you'll see.Let's start at the top.Stanley Kramer  was a great producer (""Champion"", ""Cyrano"", ""Death of a Salesman"", ""High Noon"", ""The Wild One"", ""The Caine Mutiny"") but this was his first turn as a director. He would get better (e.g., ""Inherit the Wind"", ""Judgment at Nuremberg"") but that would come years later. As well as his first directorial job, Kramer had just left Columbia after years of trouble with Harry Cohn, so this was his first attempt at an independent production.Olivia deHavilland is supposed to be an unattractive nurse. True, she was no longer the incredibly beautiful  Maid Marion, nor the bewitching Arabella Bishop, and she had moved to more middle aged roles in films like ""Snake Pit"" (1949) and ""The Heiress"" (1949), but you can't watch Olivia deHavilland and think - homely.Broderick Crawford as a top surgeon? Give me a break. Crawford was a great actor, but not as a surgeon. I remember him best from his TV days on ""Highway Patrol"" but he's most well known for winning the Oscar for ""All the King's Men"" (1949). His gruff manner and quick speech suited him for many roles, but not here.Lee Marvin as a medical student. You gotta laugh. What is the king of B movie hard guys, the nasty piece of work in ""The Big Heat"" (1953), Brando's nemesis in ""The Wild One"" (1953) doing as a medical student?Big Bob Mitchum as a physician? Mitchum was a great actor. Think of his performances in `Story of GI Joe"", or ""The Night of the Hunter"" (1955), or ""The Enemy Below"" (1957) or ""Cape Fear"" (1991) and you'll see great ability, but nowhere is there a young medical student.By the way, in 1955 Mitchum was 38 years old, Marvin was 31, and Sinatra was 40. Not exactly ""student"" types.Not everything is terrible. Lon Chaney Jr. does his usual good work, this time as Mitchum's alcoholic father. And Harry Morgan is a hoot with his Swedish accent. And look for Mae Clarke as Nurse Odell. Clarke is best remembered as the woman that Cagney hit in the face with the grapefruit in ""Public Enemy"" (1931).",2,Waste of a Great Cast,1283040000,"08 29, 2010",2010,2261,"['How', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'Stanley', 'Kramer', 'film', 'Olivia', 'DeHavilland', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'Gloria', 'Grahame', 'Broderick', 'Crawford', 'Charles', 'Bickford', 'Lee', 'Marvin', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'Jr', 'Harry', 'Morgan', 'Mae', 'Clarke', 'Watch', 'Not', 'Stranger', ""'ll"", 'see.Let', 'start', 'top.Stanley', 'Kramer', 'was', 'great', 'producer', 'Champion', 'Cyrano', 'Death', 'Salesman', 'High', 'Noon', 'Wild', 'One', 'Caine', 'Mutiny', 'was', 'first', 'turn', 'director', 'would', 'get', 'better', 'e.g.', 'Inherit', 'Wind', 'Judgment', 'Nuremberg', 'would', 'come', 'years', 'later', 'As', 'well', 'first', 'directorial', 'job', 'Kramer', 'had', 'just', 'left', 'Columbia', 'years', 'trouble', 'Harry', 'Cohn', 'was', 'first', 'attempt', 'independent', 'production.Olivia', 'deHavilland', 'supposed', 'be', 'unattractive', 'nurse', 'True', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'incredibly', 'beautiful', 'Maid', 'Marion', 'bewitching', 'Arabella', 'Bishop', 'had', 'moved', 'more', 'middle', 'aged', 'roles', 'films', 'Snake', 'Pit', '1949', 'Heiress', '1949', 'ca', ""n't"", 'watch', 'Olivia', 'deHavilland', 'think', 'homely.Broderick', 'Crawford', 'top', 'surgeon', 'Give', 'break', 'Crawford', 'was', 'great', 'actor', 'not', 'surgeon', 'remember', 'best', 'TV', 'days', 'Highway', 'Patrol', 'most', 'well', 'known', 'winning', 'Oscar', 'King', 'Men', '1949', 'gruff', 'manner', 'quick', 'speech', 'suited', 'many', 'roles', 'not', 'here.Lee', 'Marvin', 'medical', 'student', 'got', 'ta', 'laugh', 'What', 'king', 'B', 'movie', 'hard', 'guys', 'nasty', 'piece', 'work', 'Big', 'Heat', '1953', 'Brando', 'nemesis', 'Wild', 'One', '1953', 'doing', 'medical', 'student', 'Big', 'Bob', 'Mitchum', 'physician', 'Mitchum', 'was', 'great', 'actor', 'Think', 'performances', 'Story', 'GI', 'Joe', 'Night', 'Hunter', '1955', 'Enemy', 'Below', '1957', 'Cape', 'Fear', '1991', ""'ll"", 'see', 'great', 'ability', 'nowhere', 'young', 'medical', 'student.By', 'way', '1955', 'Mitchum', 'was', '38', 'years', 'old', 'Marvin', 'was', '31', 'Sinatra', 'was', '40', 'Not', 'exactly', 'student', 'types.Not', 'everything', 'terrible', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'Jr.', 'usual', 'good', 'work', 'time', 'Mitchum', 'alcoholic', 'father', 'Harry', 'Morgan', 'hoot', 'Swedish', 'accent', 'look', 'Mae', 'Clarke', 'Nurse', 'Odell', 'Clarke', 'best', 'remembered', 'woman', 'Cagney', 'hit', 'face', 'grapefruit', 'Public', 'Enemy', '1931']",N/A

He saves lives, he's smug, he looks down on people, he talks out of place in a classroom standing up to a doctor (Whit Bissell) giving a lecture, his ego is huge in this picture, and though he may see himself as perfect, we do learn that he has a weakness.As soon as Gloria Grahame enters the picture, as sexy as she is, and lays eyes on big husky Robert Mitchum, you know exactly what's going to happen.This has some good shocking scenes, some tense moments , fantastic acting...for me it was a winner.As for if this is full screen or wide-screen- being someone who has seen this once I cant be an authority on the transfer of this. It could be like Anatomy of A Murder where the widecreen print crops the top and bottom of the image and yet people do say it is a widescreen movie - Or still if it is truly widescreen and MGM just took their VHS transfer for their DVD, maybe they need to correct this by putting the film on DVD with its correct aspect ratio.No matter what the transfer is, the film to me is one that I would recommend to any fans of classics, Robert Mitchum fans.

139581,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,0792837991,Ed Uyeshima,"[5, 6]","A turgid, overlong soap opera, this 1955 social drama about ethics in the medical profession boasts a strong cast who seem at least a decade too old for their roles. This is Stanley Kramer's first film as a director, and his tendency toward preachy high-mindedness is already prevalent in this story of Lucas Marsh, a talented but selfish and arrogant student working his way through medical school. His only friend is his pragmatic roommate, caring cut-up Alfred Boone, though the focus of the plot is really the relationship between Marsh and Swedish nurse Kristina Hedvigson, a near-spinster with a $4,000 savings account (big money in the mid-1950's). Even though she is infatuated with him, Marsh does not reciprocate but still marries her to fund his education. His Machiavellian approach comes to a head when he graduates, becomes a small-town doctor, embarks on some indiscriminate behavior, and faces a failure that finally touches his long-untapped humanity.All three leads were hovering around forty when they made this film, yet based on their absolutist behavior, the characters feel like they should be in their mid-twenties. In the same year he played the crazed religious fanatic in the classicThe Night of the Hunter, Robert Mitchum is oddly miscast as Marsh since he reverts to his standard stoicism when he confronts his periodic crises of conscience. As Boone, Frank Sinatra is relegated to a supporting role who is little more than a plot device. Poor Olivia de Havilland, though top-billed, seems out of place with her male colleagues. As Kristina, she is back in Melanie mode as a selfless victim only coming to life near the end. There is more interesting work on the sidelines. Earlier in the film are effective turns by Broderick Crawford as the gruff medical school professor and Lee Marvin as a more carefree student. Arriving late in the movie, Charles Bickford as Marsh's small-town mentor and Gloria Grahame as a libidinous divorcee also make vivid impressions. With a few shots of surprising realism, the film looks like it inspired every medical TV drama that followed. What doesn't surprise me is that this film, despite its star-heavy cast, has not been transferred to DVD. It is simply that boring and contrived.",2,Lethargic Medical Soap Opera Has Moments of Realism But Suffers from Serious Miscasting,1178409600,"05 6, 2007",2007,2248,"['turgid', 'overlong', 'soap', 'opera', '1955', 'social', 'drama', 'ethics', 'medical', 'profession', 'strong', 'cast', 'who', 'seem', 'least', 'decade', 'too', 'old', 'roles', 'Stanley', 'Kramer', 'first', 'film', 'director', 'tendency', 'preachy', 'high-mindedness', 'already', 'prevalent', 'story', 'Lucas', 'Marsh', 'talented', 'selfish', 'arrogant', 'student', 'working', 'way', 'medical', 'school', 'only', 'friend', 'pragmatic', 'roommate', 'caring', 'cut-up', 'Alfred', 'Boone', 'focus', 'plot', 'really', 'relationship', 'Marsh', 'Swedish', 'nurse', 'Kristina', 'Hedvigson', 'near-spinster', '4,000', 'savings', 'account', 'big', 'money', 'mid-1950', 'Even', 'infatuated', 'Marsh', 'not', 'reciprocate', 'still', 'fund', 'education', 'Machiavellian', 'approach', 'head', 'when', 'small-town', 'doctor', 'indiscriminate', 'behavior', 'failure', 'finally', 'long-untapped', 'humanity.All', 'three', 'leads', 'were', 'hovering', 'around', 'forty', 'when', 'made', 'film', 'yet', 'based', 'absolutist', 'behavior', 'characters', 'feel', 'should', 'be', 'mid-twenties', 'same', 'year', 'played', 'crazed', 'religious', 'fanatic', 'classicThe', 'Night', 'Hunter', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'oddly', 'miscast', 'Marsh', 'standard', 'stoicism', 'when', 'periodic', 'crises', 'conscience', 'Boone', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'relegated', 'supporting', 'role', 'who', 'little', 'more', 'plot', 'device', 'Poor', 'Olivia', 'de', 'Havilland', 'top-billed', 'place', 'male', 'colleagues', 'Kristina', 'back', 'Melanie', 'mode', 'selfless', 'victim', 'only', 'coming', 'life', 'end', 'more', 'interesting', 'work', 'sidelines', 'Earlier', 'film', 'are', 'effective', 'turns', 'Broderick', 'Crawford', 'gruff', 'medical', 'school', 'professor', 'Lee', 'Marvin', 'more', 'carefree', 'student', 'Arriving', 'late', 'movie', 'Charles', 'Bickford', 'Marsh', 'small-town', 'mentor', 'Gloria', 'Grahame', 'libidinous', 'divorcee', 'also', 'make', 'vivid', 'impressions', 'few', 'shots', 'surprising', 'realism', 'film', 'inspired', 'medical', 'TV', 'drama', 'followed', 'What', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'film', 'star-heavy', 'cast', 'not', 'been', 'transferred', 'DVD', 'simply', 'boring', 'contrived']",N/A

Then there is another aspiring doctor, Lucas Marsh played by Robert Mitchum. He is the best of them plus he's really built. But he is poor & doesn't have enough money to finish med school. Along comes ""plain jane"" nurse Kristina, played by Olivia de Havilland. She lives with her parents, doesn't get out much & is turning into a spinster. But she has saved her  $$$. Lucas romances her, she falls in love & they marry. His $$$ problems are solved & he has a wife he doesn't love. Lucas is a great doctor & I wouldn't mind being his patient. His people skills however, are lacking. He only has time in his life for medicine. As a result he alienates those around him, most notably his wife. He has impossibly high standards that no one can reach including himself. He is not god. Lots of familiar faces including Harry Morgan playing Kris' idiot father, Brodrick Crawford as the principled pathologist & several others.The most ludicrous and frankly distracting item is the fact that apparently everyone chain smokes.

Olivia d'Haviland did an awesome job, as always, in her role as a rejected wife. Frank Sinatra made his role as though it was his own. He seemed very comfortable playing a serious role, and I believe this was one of his first.Although this is one of my favorite Robert Mitchum movies, the one thing I dislike the most is how robotish Robert is.
