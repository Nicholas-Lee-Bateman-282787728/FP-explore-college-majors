1623470,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00B9LNOKM,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[10, 10]","With the release of the Digimon series in the late nineties, the show was (more often than not) compared to the worldwide phenomenon of Pokemon. I think that this both hurt the show and helped it. At least while people were debating the merits of each, they were watching. Despite this initial outcry, however, the Digimon franchise has stood the test of time. Over the years, Digimon has undergone many changes and completed five distinct seasons. Later this year, in fact, Nickelodeon is going to launch ""Digimon Fusion"" to initiate a new generation to the classic anime. That's fine, but there's something to be said about catching a series from its origin point. Having recently revisited Seasons One and Two, I was glad to see an official release of ""Digimon Tamers.""""Digimon Tamers"" is the official third season of the Digimon franchise. When it originally debuted in 2001, there was some resistance from fans. Introducing a whole new cast, many were a bit underwhelmed by the early episodes. What soon becomes clear, however, is that the tone of the piece is also quite different from its predecessors. The longer the season progressed, the more it was understood and embraced. Taking its time to develop characters, this is a calmer and somewhat more mature look at the Digimon world. At times, it's darker and more realistic. It has a slow build appeal that leads to a finale with real emotional resonance. Trust me, you'll be surprised by the impact that this has!DVD Details: The presentation of all 51 episodes of Season Three are loaded onto eight DVDs that run about eighteen hours in total. These are the English language versions that were initially broadcast here in the states. I, personally, would have liked to see the original anime included (with subtitles) as opposed to this strictly English language version which has some rather painful dubbing at times.Bonus: On the DVD, there is a Gallery feature that showcases over 40 villain sketches from the series. While this is nice enough considering the lack of additional DVD features, the real bonus for fans is the inclusion of a 32 page booklet with the set. This is a character guide book, which is both interesting and useful to refresh your memory about your favorites from the Digimon universe. It's not the fanciest presentation, but it certainly is cool. Perfect, again, for helping initiate new viewers.Synopsis: Season Three takes place in a separate universe than the prior episodes. Three new kids find themselves drawn into the Digital World. As you might expect, they meet other tamers and new evils around every corner. What distinguishes this season, however, are the closer bonds formed between the human and non-human elements. For the first time, the Digimon actually seem to be real characters with independent motivations. And some of the story lines are surprisingly mature and/or introspective. As I alluded to, it's hard not to feel the emotional gut punch when this one comes to a close.

I was sorta expecting it to come a day or two late since Prestige was handling it, but this was a pleasant surprise, unlike the DVD which was what I expected it to be. Don't get me wrong, I am absolutely grateful they even released it, but it terms of how they DVD itself is setup, it's identical to the release of Digimon Season 1. Eight discs each sporting a menu proceeded by a part of the season' opening, in which the only option is to play all or watch an individual episode, with the exception of the last disc which has some artwork. It would have been nice if the original Japanese version was included as well as a making of or retrospective feature, but these are more suggestions than complaints. I'm fine with the English dub having grown up watching The Movie. The video quality itself looks quite clean and crisp. So while the features of the DVD set are indeed simplistic, I'd say it was worth my money.

1623472,A2MSEHXAGTB46I,B00B9LNOKM,Lia Quinn,"[4, 6]","Digimon Adventure (season one) was the series that got me into anime. I was, to say the very least, skeptical when I first heard of season three since this broke away with the characters and established formula of the previous two seasons. I was prepared to hate it.But then, I watched it and...actually liked it. A lot. After the fifteenth or so episode, I was hooked. By the end of its run, I actually cried.Like what a few reviewers already mentioned, this show did a good job of rounding out all the characters in this. And I do mean all. Unlike in the previous two seasons where the Digimon were near carbon copies in personality to their partner, the Digimon have their own desires and thoughts that are a bit more independent to their tamer. In other words, the partnerships are actually real partnerships. Without spoiling the later plots, both Tamer and Digimon will need to work as one to defeat the enemy.On that note, this show actually has adult characters. Normally in this genre of anime, the parents are, at best, on the sidelines...if they ever even find out about their kids' side jobs at all. And the adults' role in the story plays a huge role.The plots are well above most anything that usually targets this age group...there's angst, there's loss, there's joy. Problems are not always resolved by the end of the episode, and some things will never be fixed. None of it is sugarcoated, yet it remains age-appropriate.Overall, I'd highly recommend this as a good introduction series into anime for a kid between seven and twelve, but most people who are older will be able to enjoy it too. And if anyone skipped this when it was on the air (or the rest of Digimon) because it seemed too much like Pokemon...it's similar in title only.

For any fan of Digimon (who truly find Pokemon to be an irritating annoyance - &#34;pika pika!&#34;), when you first looked at this third season on Fox Kids (years ago), you might've thought to yourself &#34;...this season's gonna suck.  Where's Davis and the crew?  Why couldn't they continue their grown-up adventures?  Where's Seraphimon (mega level of Patamon)?  How are they going to show his 'digivolution' on the movie, and not in the series?  Is this season gonna be any good?&#34;  After seeing the first episode of the third season, you might've thought to yourself &#34;...hmm; not bad.  Very interesting concept.&#34;  For Digimon - as far as the t.v. series goes - this season really was a game changer.  (spoiler alert) Real world application towards the storyline, making up a digimon from a drawing, the data absorption of the losing digimon's data into the winning digimon, the 'D-Reaper,' just about everything you thought you knew about the series changed...for the better.  For one, never did I think that a human partner / tamer of the digimon can fuse with their digimon to form a mega level digimon - Insane.  Then to have such an emotional storyline (ex: Jeri after the loss of her digimon, Leomon) and how Beelzemon (mega level of Impmon - his 'digivolution' from the rookie level came into effect with help from a 'Digimon Sovereign') took it so hard of what he did to her that he had an almost spiritual change from a bad, misguided fool into a good guy (you'll even see the difference in the color of his eyes and his outfit when that happens) which was really awesome.  Differences from the first and second seasons are drastic: how the characters had to travel to the digital world and how it looked, to how the data stream sweeps the characters away to a different area (placing them further away then where they were at) - the original concept is re-tooled, but the results are satisfying, nonetheless.  If you decide to get this season, you won't be disapointed.  I'm a fan of Digimon, so I knew this was brought as soon as I saw it on sale (especially since I had to wait until becoming a family man to get this series - my wife looks at me looking at this, and shakes her head, talking about &#34;a grown-tail man looking at Digimon.&#34;  I told her it's not my fault that 'the peoples' had to wait so long to release this season on DVD)!

1623482,AP6YITDVNZD0U,B00B9LNOKM,ToonXpert87,"[8, 14]","Just when I thought this set would be out after mine & my niece's birthday (August 27th to be exact, yes we have the same b-day a whole 25 years apart!), New Video Group has done it again with the 3rd season of Digimon; all 51 unedited American episodes/prints on an 8-disc set! I wonder if New Video Group's also planning a Movie Collection for the theatrical & TV Digimon movies so far, since the 3rd season's TV movies ain't likely to be here. Such as the infamous Battle of Adventurers with Mephistomon & his V-pet cronies, and especially Runaway Locomon, where Rika's birthday was going sweet AND sour, sweet for her landmark one-hit wonder ""Promise"", and sour for Locomon and the Parasimon invasion. But I digress, how was the country (the USA at least) to know about the 9/11 attacks when the season was just kicking off here? In the 3rd season's realm, the 1st & 2nd seasons are only a TV show & franchise; yet ironically, Davis from season 2 was this season's narrator, just as Rika was for the majority of season 4! In this set, you'll find out about Guilmon's mischievous nature, Impmon's bully-like nature, Calumon's happy-go-lucky attitude, and much much more, as Takato, Henry & Rika's adventures with real Digimon & their human friends ultimately take them to the digi-world at last. Long-time digi-fans like me are a shoo-in for this set, TV movies or no. Believe it or not, the fella who gave original adult Furbies their voices (Tony Pope) also lent his voice to one of the 4 Sovereign; Zhuqiaomon, the ""overgrown canary"" or ""turkey"" described by Henry's Terriermon. Other voice acting jokes are in here as I recall, such as a misled cop sounding like Foghorn Leghorn, Takato's teacher having a very familiar voice from seasons 1 & 2 AND Cartoon Network's Juniper Lee herself, a Divermon leader who sounds like Bullwinkle J. Moose ""hisself"", a talkative Devidramon who also sounds familiar to an old FIEND, an Infermon from 100 DNA-digivolved Chrysalimon who sounds like the movie's original, one of the 12 Devas being played by Tai Kamiya's original (American) actor and Impmon/Beelzemon himself who sounds similar to Harry the Wet/Sticky bandit! Let's not forget that Ryo crossed dimensions with Ken years before this season took place, or what I call ""Censored nudity"" for Biomerge-digivolving, which got this season & #4 in hot water with older fans or the elders of younger fans. Censored nudity means that even though human characters are seen completely naked, you can't see anything inexplicable about them, ever! (It was like this in their original Japanese versions too) Fasten your seat belts this summer, it's gonna be a another bumpy ride into reality (in this season's realm), with the DVD debut of Digimon's 3rd season!",5,"This is a very interesting season set, ""Takatomon""!",1360713600,"02 13, 2013",2013,2752,"['Just', 'when', 'thought', 'set', 'would', 'be', 'out', 'mine', 'niece', 'birthday', 'August', '27th', 'be', 'exact', 'yes', 'have', 'same', 'b-day', 'whole', '25', 'years', 'apart', 'New', 'Video', 'Group', 'done', 'again', '3rd', 'season', 'Digimon', '51', 'unedited', 'American', 'episodes/prints', '8-disc', 'set', 'wonder', 'New', 'Video', 'Group', 'also', 'planning', 'Movie', 'Collection', 'theatrical', 'TV', 'Digimon', 'movies', 'so', 'far', '3rd', 'season', 'TV', 'movies', 'ai', ""n't"", 'likely', 'be', 'here', 'Such', 'infamous', 'Battle', 'Adventurers', 'Mephistomon', 'V-pet', 'cronies', 'especially', 'Runaway', 'Locomon', 'where', 'Rika', 'birthday', 'was', 'going', 'sweet', 'AND', 'sour', 'sweet', 'landmark', 'one-hit', 'wonder', 'Promise', 'sour', 'Locomon', 'Parasimon', 'invasion', 'digress', 'how', 'was', 'country', 'USA', 'least', 'know', '9/11', 'attacks', 'when', 'season', 'was', 'just', 'kicking', 'off', 'here', '3rd', 'season', 'realm', '1st', '2nd', 'seasons', 'are', 'only', 'TV', 'show', 'franchise', 'ironically', 'Davis', 'season', '2', 'was', 'season', 'narrator', 'just', 'Rika', 'was', 'majority', 'season', '4', 'set', ""'ll"", 'find', 'out', 'Guilmon', 'mischievous', 'nature', 'Impmon', 'bully-like', 'nature', 'Calumon', 'happy-go-lucky', 'attitude', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'Takato', 'Henry', 'Rika', 'adventures', 'real', 'Digimon', 'human', 'ultimately', 'take', 'digi-world', 'last', 'Long-time', 'digi-fans', 'are', 'shoo-in', 'set', 'TV', 'movies', 'Believe', 'not', 'fella', 'who', 'gave', 'original', 'adult', 'Furbies', 'voices', 'Tony', 'Pope', 'also', 'lent', 'voice', 'one', '4', 'Sovereign', 'Zhuqiaomon', 'overgrown', 'canary', 'turkey', 'described', 'Henry', 'Terriermon', 'Other', 'voice', 'acting', 'jokes', 'are', 'here', 'recall', 'such', 'misled', 'cop', 'sounding', 'Foghorn', 'Leghorn', 'Takato', 'teacher', 'having', 'very', 'familiar', 'voice', 'seasons', '1', '2', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'Juniper', 'Lee', 'Divermon', 'leader', 'who', 'Bullwinkle', 'J.', 'Moose', 'hisself', 'talkative', 'Devidramon', 'who', 'also', 'familiar', 'old', 'FIEND', 'Infermon', '100', 'DNA-digivolved', 'Chrysalimon', 'who', 'movie', 'original', 'one', '12', 'Devas', 'being', 'played', 'Tai', 'Kamiya', 'original', 'American', 'actor', 'Impmon/Beelzemon', 'who', 'similar', 'Harry', 'Wet/Sticky', 'bandit', 'Let', 'not', 'forget', 'Ryo', 'crossed', 'dimensions', 'Ken', 'years', 'season', 'took', 'place', 'what', 'call', 'Censored', 'nudity', 'Biomerge-digivolving', 'got', 'season', '4', 'hot', 'water', 'older', 'fans', 'elders', 'younger', 'fans', 'Censored', 'nudity', 'even', 'human', 'characters', 'are', 'seen', 'completely', 'naked', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'inexplicable', 'ever', 'was', 'original', 'Japanese', 'versions', 'too', 'Fasten', 'seat', 'belts', 'summer', 'gon', 'na', 'be', 'bumpy', 'ride', 'reality', 'season', 'realm', 'DVD', 'debut', 'Digimon', '3rd', 'season']",Digimon Tamers: Season 3
