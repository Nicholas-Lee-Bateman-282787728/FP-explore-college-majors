One should not dare to criticise Steve Smith as a drummer because he definitely is one of the masters of drumming.I believe that intermediate and advanced drummers can really learn from this DVD and improve themselves as a result. The information given on drumset technique is a very valuable tool and it opened my eyes on some issues even after 17 years of playing. I liked the ""history of the U.S beat"" part very much, especially the incredible performance with the ""Vital Information"".",5,Worth every cent,1100044800,"11 10, 2004",2004,1019,"['Having', 'bought', 'lots', 'so', 'called', 'instructional', 'DVD', 'being', 'disappointed', 'majority', 'was', 'very', 'reluctant', 'buy', 'DVD.Being', 'rock-oriented', 'drummer', 'personal', 'influences', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'different', 'was', 'little', 'bit', 'prejudiced', 'towards', 'fusion', 'type', 'drummers', 'main', 'strength', 'technical', 'ability', 'are', 'lacking', 'terms', 'feeling', 'power', 'passion', 'required', 'unable', 'create', 'pulse', 'defined', 'Steve', 'himself.Steve', 'Smith', 'awesome', 'inspiring', 'blew', 'mind', 'away', 'One', 'should', 'not', 'dare', 'criticise', 'Steve', 'Smith', 'drummer', 'definitely', 'one', 'masters', 'drumming.I', 'believe', 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'drummers', 'can', 'really', 'learn', 'DVD', 'improve', 'result', 'information', 'given', 'drumset', 'technique', 'very', 'valuable', 'tool', 'opened', 'eyes', 'issues', 'even', '17', 'years', 'playing', 'liked', 'history', 'U.S', 'beat', 'part', 'very', 'much', 'especially', 'incredible', 'performance', 'Vital', 'Information']",Steve Smith-Drumset Technique/History of the U.S. Beat Set

A Flory,"[2, 6]","I have never played the drums but I decided that I needed to learn more about drumming and complex rhythm in order to improve my songwriting.I had a bad opinion of drums because, face it:  most rock drummers are incapable of playing under other instruments, have no dynamic control, don't know how to tune their kit, and think that china cymbals are for imitating the sound of an SUV crashing through a plate glass window.I never imagined what drums could do in the hands of a master.  Steve Smith is an extraordinary musician and very gifted teacher.  He has a scholarly knowlege of the history of his art, and his illustration of historical drumming styles is fascinating.The quality of musicianship and pedagogy on this DVD set is first rate, and I plan to get a lot of use from it as I learn the basics of drumming.",5,Awesome.

That's good information but I wanted to see his footwork more and hear more about hand technique.Steve is an amazing drummer and this is good to watch on a long airline flight because it's not about drumming with him, it's about him drumming for your information.For shear drum playing knowledge the Tommy Igoe and Joe Morello videos are a better investment and you can get them right here on Amazon (that's where I bought them :-)Good luck and good music to all",3,Well produced by a master drummer,1388188800,"12 28, 2013",2013,623,"['was', 'hoping', 'more', 'technique', 'instruction', 'video', 'off', 'more', 'encyclopedia', 'where', 'drumming', 'came', 'what', 'different', 'styles', 'are', 'good', 'information', 'wanted', 'see', 'footwork', 'more', 'hear', 'more', 'hand', 'technique.Steve', 'amazing', 'drummer', 'good', 'watch', 'long', 'airline', 'flight', 'not', 'drumming', 'drumming', 'information.For', 'shear', 'drum', 'playing', 'knowledge', 'Tommy', 'Igoe', 'Joe', 'Morello', 'videos', 'are', 'better', 'investment', 'can', 'get', 'right', 'here', 'Amazon', 'where', 'bought', 'Good', 'luck', 'good', 'music']",Steve Smith-Drumset Technique/History of the U.S. Beat Set

Lindeboom ""theboomer""","[42, 43]","First off: I was never a huge fan of Journey, so any effusive prose that may come from the tips of my little fingoids as I type is not coming from there.  ;o)  Steve is one of the most well-rounded and musically diverse drummers that I've ever seen. He plays it all and does it amazingly well. I've been playing since 1964 and have taught my son to play and am now starting to teach my grandson. My son was blown away when he came to my house and watched some of this DVD with me. In less than an hour, Steve had shown my son an appreciation for diverse musicial styles that I'd been trying to open him up to for years. Steve is *that* good as a teacher. I don't think I've ever seen better. While I would indeed rank this as an intermediate-to-advanced instructional DVD, he succeeds wonderfully in communicating his techniques for expanding your own expertise on the drums. The only thing that I find a drawback is that when I watch it, I am distinctly jealous of those just starting out in their young drumming careers today and who have great instruction like this to begin with. :o) This is amazing stuff. I own many drum technique video/DVD sets and this is the best of the breed. If I could give it 10 stars, I would. Thanks Steve for giving fresh inspiration to a grandpa who still loves to drum and who can't wait for his next chance to kick some ass behind the kit, and is truly grateful that I can get this kind of instruction to my son and grandson so that one day they can blast past the old man -- but they're going to have to work at it to do so, I ain't giving in that easy! ;o)",5,"Wow!
