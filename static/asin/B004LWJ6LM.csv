1414187,A2Q05I3W8HAROC,B004LWJ6LM,"Amanda Jane Volovik ""Chava""","[1, 6]","Reviewed by Amanda Volovik ""Chava"": Although compelling and well-acted, I have strong feelings about this film and don't want to create a series of spoilers. A couple loses their child to a serial killer and hatches a plot to exact revenge on the man who didn't get what he deserved in the justice system. Actually, I've seen all the 'banned' films, including HC2, Salo, Serbian Film, and I didn't have to put something over my face and turn down the sound like with this film. The moral I came away with is that I couldn't go to those lengths no matter what was done to me or my family. Looking at the man's face during the 'action' was very sad, disturbing and real.***Possible Spoiler: There is something to being 'right up with the lens' to the torture and atrocities here that makes it worse. It made me hate the parent/torturers more than him for what he had done at that point, interestingly. If it came to it, hypothetically, just execute the guy, people, be done with it! lol.

1414188,A2CYV6VOL9YM0R,B004LWJ6LM,awesomep,"[0, 1]","Being a parent, I understand one's hatred for those who would harm their child.  Of course, many would want to torture or kill this killer.  Elise and her husband were no different from many of us with that kind of hatred inside of them.  Justice was not served in the courtroom.  How unrealistic to serve a killer with only a 25 to life sentence for the hidious crime of this child.(Some Spoliers Below):From reading some of the earlier reviews, I found this movie to be unrealistic at times as well.  Were they too full of hatred to not notice the man they were torturing as not the killer?  It would never be that easy to spike the officers drink with a drug.  Did he not wonder why she was standing so close to him without saying anything?  When did the so-called killer have time to get some paper and write a suicide letter for a crime he did not comment.  This was after his escape from the couple.  I guess from all that torturing, they convinced him that he did it.The ending was disappointing for me also.  It made the movie twice as sad. Now we have a couple who's life are not only destroyed by the death of their son, but now they are criminals themselves.  These types of movies are not my cup of tea.  I fast forwarded most of the movie.  I could not watch or listen to the torturing.  It was more than my eyes and stomach could take.  The story was wrong all around.  Clearly, no one should kill another, and the killer should not be kidnapped and killed by their victims as well.

The biggest complaint I have is I believe I have seen at least one of two very very similar versions that play on the same theme and evetual outcome. The best part of the film is the acting by the two main actors: the husband and wife, well done convincing job.

1414191,A2582KMXLK2P06,B004LWJ6LM,B. E Jackson,"[2, 3]","WHAT the??  The Tortured satisfies that secret urge most of us have for revenge, *especially* when it pertains to a little child being kidnapped and ultimately killed leaving the parents grieving and crying for justice.  If you DESPISE the idea of seeing what was once a normal, happy and innocent family suffer through several years of emotional sadness over such a tragedy, oh boy, you will *love* the Tortured.  Sort of unusual to see Erika Christensen -who plays a significantly more peaceful and rational parent in the hit TV show Parenthood- star as a ruthless mother out for revenge.  She really surprised me in this role!So what's this movie about?  Imagine getting the opportunity to physically torture the person who kidnapped and killed your child.  Would you do it?  Would you torture the man until he's almost dead but make sure he's drugged enough to keep him alive *just* for the purpose of torturing him some more?  I have a feeling several parents would.  After the husband and wife spend way too long accusing and criticizing each other over who's to blame for their sons eventual murder, they come up with a plan to break that murderer out of a prison van, kidnap HIM and bring the man to a personal torture chamber in the basement of some house in the middle of nowhere.  From here, they tie the man down and strap him in real tight and well, what's the name of the movie?  Yes, TORTURE HIM AND MAKE HIM PAY!!!  Even Erika Christensen's character almost reaches a point of remorse when her husband gets a little *too* into torturing the man.Oh man, I'm not even going to mention all the twisted and sickening techniques used to make the man suffer, but needless to say, you'll probably feel a little bit of satisfaction and justice by the time this movie is done.  Anyone that hurts a child is a horrible human being.  My only quibble is that the movie is only 75 minutes long.  Really too short and somewhat rushed in several respects all so the plot can focus hard and heavy on the actual torturing.  The ending was too quick as well.  I don't have a problem with the way the events wrapped up at the end other than -without spoiling it- words can't exactly bring back that child.

1414192,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B004LWJ6LM,California Dreaming,"[0, 0]","I used to always love watching those old ""Death Wish"" films, where Charles Bronson went all, well, Bronsonian on all those thugs.  Fun.  There were clearly the bad guys -- whomever Mr. Bronson was enacting his punishment -- and the good guys, or rather guy -- Mr. Bronson.  It was a couple hours of escapist fun.Now, I guess that his films fell into the vigilante justice category, while this film falls into the revenge category, kind of like ""I Spit on Your Grave.""  Personally, I liked the original ISOYG film; I believe that there was a remake as well.  But the original was ""fun"" in the sense that, there were people who truly deserved whatever they got, and so you didn't feel much empathy -- heck, forget even the lesser sympathy -- for them and so you didn't mind watching some guy lose something of importance in a shoulda-been-but-actually-wasn't-horrific bathtub scene.While watching films such as ""The Tortured,"" I always create a list of possible endings in my head early on, and then stack rank them to figure out which one is most likely going to happen.  And then of course, if I guess correctly by saying, ""This is what's going to happen!"" and then I am later right, I pat myself on the back for a job well done.  Perhaps that's the intent of directors and writers of these films.  But in reality, that's kind of annoying, because it takes away from the movie experience for me.  I spend more time thinking about plot than thinking about theme.  And this happened to me while watching here.It seems that this film is making the same-old-lame-old you-can't-bring-him-back-by-exacting-revenge theme, and it almost works here.  There were issues though, of course.  1.  The dialog kept bouncing back and forth between the two main leads, who wanted revenge and who didn't, and each of their opinions seemed to change many times.  That was inconsistent to me.  2.  The movie started too late in the family's story, not giving us any reason to care about these actors.  3.  The movie actually was a little too short, oddly, at I believe only about an hour and 15 minutes.  I think if they would have added fifteen minutes to the film -- at the beginning -- this would have fixed two of their problems.While the female lead -- Erika Christensen -- is actually surprisingly good here with the dialog and action she has to work with, I'm going to have to say, ""Don't torture yourself.  Take this film off your Wish List.""  I'm going to exact some revenge myself on this film for an hour or so minorly wasted, and give it a minor pass.",3,A Tortured Plot,1359849600,"02 3, 2013",2013,2543,"['used', 'always', 'love', 'watching', 'old', 'Death', 'Wish', 'films', 'where', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'went', 'well', 'Bronsonian', 'thugs', 'Fun', 'were', 'clearly', 'bad', 'guys', 'Mr.', 'Bronson', 'was', 'enacting', 'punishment', 'good', 'guys', 'rather', 'guy', 'Mr.', 'Bronson', 'was', 'couple', 'hours', 'escapist', 'fun.Now', 'guess', 'films', 'fell', 'vigilante', 'justice', 'category', 'film', 'revenge', 'category', 'kind', 'Spit', 'Grave', 'Personally', 'liked', 'original', 'ISOYG', 'film', 'believe', 'was', 'remake', 'as', 'well', 'original', 'was', 'fun', 'sense', 'were', 'people', 'who', 'truly', 'deserved', 'got', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'much', 'empathy', 'heck', 'forget', 'even', 'lesser', 'sympathy', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'watching', 'guy', 'lose', 'something', 'importance', ""shoulda-been-but-actually-wasn't-horrific"", 'bathtub', 'scene.While', 'watching', 'films', 'such', 'Tortured', 'always', 'create', 'list', 'possible', 'endings', 'head', 'early', 'then', 'stack', 'rank', 'figure', 'out', 'one', 'most', 'likely', 'going', 'happen', 'then', 'course', 'guess', 'correctly', 'saying', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'then', 'am', 'later', 'right', 'pat', 'back', 'job', 'well', 'done', 'Perhaps', 'intent', 'directors', 'writers', 'films', 'reality', 'kind', 'annoying', 'away', 'movie', 'experience', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'thinking', 'plot', 'thinking', 'theme', 'happened', 'watching', 'here.It', 'film', 'making', 'same-old-lame-old', ""you-can't-bring-him-back-by-exacting-revenge"", 'theme', 'almost', 'here', 'were', 'issues', 'course', '1', 'dialog', 'kept', 'bouncing', 'back', 'forth', 'two', 'main', 'leads', 'who', 'wanted', 'revenge', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'opinions', 'seemed', 'change', 'many', 'times', 'was', 'inconsistent', '2', 'movie', 'started', 'too', 'late', 'family', 'story', 'not', 'giving', 'reason', 'care', 'actors', '3', 'movie', 'actually', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'short', 'oddly', 'believe', 'only', 'hour', '15', 'minutes', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'film', 'beginning', 'would', 'have', 'fixed', 'two', 'problems.While', 'female', 'lead', 'Erika', 'Christensen', 'actually', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'here', 'dialog', 'action', 'work', ""'m"", 'going', 'have', 'say', 'Do', ""n't"", 'torture', 'Take', 'film', 'Wish', 'List', ""'m"", 'going', 'exact', 'revenge', 'film', 'hour', 'so', 'minorly', 'wasted', 'give', 'minor', 'pass']",N/A

A mother and father want to punish the serial killer who tortured and killed their son. Honestly, who wouldn't sympathize with that? So Mom and Dad kidnap the killer while he is being transported to a prison and lock him up in a empty cabin's basement and torture him.This is not easy for them, as they are not evil like the serial killer is, the mother especially has a hard time sometimes. Makes sense. Realistically done. Super.However, the twist ending blew everything out of the water. Now, there is not necessarily anything wrong with twist endings, as long as they are delivered and executed well and enhance the plot. In this case, it did NOT happen. It only ruined the movie and completely cheapened the story.",2,Sigh,1355184000,"12 11, 2012",2012,798,"['would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'much', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'twist', 'ending', 'mother', 'father', 'want', 'punish', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'tortured', 'killed', 'son', 'Honestly', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'sympathize', 'So', 'Mom', 'Dad', 'kidnap', 'killer', 'being', 'transported', 'prison', 'lock', 'up', 'empty', 'cabin', 'basement', 'torture', 'him.This', 'not', 'easy', 'are', 'not', 'evil', 'serial', 'killer', 'mother', 'especially', 'hard', 'time', 'sometimes', 'Makes', 'sense', 'Realistically', 'done', 'Super.However', 'twist', 'ending', 'blew', 'everything', 'water', 'Now', 'not', 'necessarily', 'anything', 'wrong', 'twist', 'endings', 'as', 'long', 'are', 'delivered', 'executed', 'well', 'enhance', 'plot', 'case', 'did', 'NOT', 'happen', 'only', 'ruined', 'movie', 'completely', 'cheapened', 'story']",N/A

He is all grown up and able to torment someone to the point where I had to cover my eyes a few times. The movie is quite good for this type of low budget thriller. A twist ending that you can predict quite easily. Very watchable but be prepared for all the graphic torture.,4,Jesse is all grown up!,1356998400,"01 1, 2013",2013,338,"['What', 'happened', 'nice', 'sexy', 'boy', 'toy', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'grown', 'up', 'able', 'torment', 'someone', 'point', 'where', 'had', 'cover', 'eyes', 'few', 'times', 'movie', 'quite', 'good', 'type', 'low', 'budget', 'thriller', 'twist', 'ending', 'can', 'predict', 'quite', 'easily', 'Very', 'watchable', 'be', 'prepared', 'graphic', 'torture']",N/A
1414204,A1XT8AJB7S9JJG,B004LWJ6LM,Tony Heck,"[7, 9]","""Killing him isn't punishment enough."" Elise (Christensen) hugs her son goodbye and goes to work. Craig (Metcalfe) is going to play soccer with him but goes in the house to get sunscreen for him. He looks out the window and sees a man grab him and run off. Unable to catch up to the truck he calls the police but the don't find the boy in time. When they hear the the kidnappers punishment is only 25 years to life they take it upon themselves to give him the sentence he deserves. My disclaimer for this is the same I had for ""God Bless America"". I am in no way advocating what is in this movie but it's something that almost everyone would agree with. The parents find a way to kidnap the kidnapper and proceed to torture him in a way that is both disturbing and satisfying in order to make him feel what he did to their son. While not quite to the level of ""Saw"" or ""Hostel"" there are still some pretty graphic scenes in this that make you want to turn away a couple times. There really isn't that much to this movie except the torture, but if you liked movies like ""Death Sentence"" then you will love this one as well. I did. Overall, a disturbing, graphic and satisfying movie that actually has a neat ending that shows you why you shouldn't take the law into your own hands. I give it a B+.",4,A disturbing yet somewhat satisfying look at what happens when you push parents too far. Graphic but should be seen.
