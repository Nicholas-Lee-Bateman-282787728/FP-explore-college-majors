Actress Rade Serbedzija is wonderful. And of course the one and only Michael Caine deserved his nomination for Best Actor. I love moody, atmospheric films and THE QUIET AMERICAN is surely that.

607987,A3Q77CS1DEQLMG,B00005JLXB,Alessandro Bruno,"[1, 1]","""The Quiet American"" by Phillip Noyce is one of the best films I saw in a long time. Michael Caine is wonderful to watch as he plots his revenge scheme while uncovering the CIA agent's plot, yet Brandon Fraser's performance as the 'Quiet American' is also very believable, as is his romantic interest in the girl. Ultimately, beyond the performances, I admit my interest and appreciation of the film stem from the actuality and relevance of the story to current events, it really makes one think about the manipulation of events that are then used as the excuse to start wars. The film is based on a novel by Graham Greene, who got the idea for the novel upon returning from a trip to Indochina in October 1951.  The famous writer spent various months in different periods in Indochina as a correspondent for ""Life"" Magazine. He, therefore, was able to observe the emerging conflict up close. As a writer, Greene was always able to reconcile fiction within the context of reality.  The film by Noyce closely reflects the original spirit of the novel.  Indeed, a previous adaptation of Greene's novel in film by J. Mankiewicz in 1958 was to close in time and space to the events discussed in the novel and Greene was not pleased with the result.

We are then transported back to the introduction of these two characters, against the backdrop of the growing Communist unrest under the French occupation. Philip Noyce's adaptation of Graham Greene's acclaimed novel of international intrigue, meanders more than races away with the story from this point, but builds with almost intoxicating subliminal undertones, as the two main characters begin to battle for the affections of the local beautiful mistress of the aforementioned Caine.Caine in married in England, and cannot get a divorce through his wife's Catholicism, and his young mistress (played with alluring but almost innocent guile by  Do Thi Hai Yen) cannot after being involved with a foreigner marry a Vietnamese man, should Caine leave the country. She begins to see the young enigmatic and outwardly gentle Fraser as a ticket out, and this three way pot boiler adds some distraction to the political plot. However, as the story unfolds, we see that our characters are not all that they appear to be, and as Caine delves deeper into the Vietnamese situation, he and Fraser become embroiled in a political cat and mouse game, the end results of which we have seen at the outset.There's something anti climactic about knowing the end before you start, but the pedigree of Greene's novel rises above that, and keeps your attention throughout the reasonable short 100 minute run time. The acting is solid all-round, particularly by Tzi Ma as Caines doting local assistant, and each character develops, and ultimately keeps us guessing until the end of the picture. Doubtful to top any best movie polls, and indeed was never in contention for accolades, but it is still well worth seeing none the less.

I recommend it to all viewers interested in Vietnam and the acting of Michael Caine who plays the lead character, Thomas Fowler.The film is based on the book by Graeme Greene and it set in the Vietnam of 1952 when French colonial rule was collapsing and the influence of America was correspondingly rising.  The country is slowing slipping into chaos from which it will not even begin to emerge for a generation.  Some countries are seemingly inflicted with a role in world history that they would rather not experience.  Vietnam is one such country.The film is a wonderful production and owes much to the direction of Phillip Noyce who covers his subject matter with great care.  The result is a beautiful but tragic film.  Thomas Fowler rises above mediocrity to become a truly successful journalist while the rank opportunism of the US government is exposed for all to see.

607992,A2EL3990HXOMZB,B00005JLXB,Antonio Robert,"[7, 16]","This 2002 film version of Graham Greene's novel ""The Quiet American"" got its fair share of controversy by employing a topic politically not correct enough in a post 9/11 era -- America's involvement in Vietnam. In fact, the belated release helped the movie to garner more audience (and favour), which was good for it, as the transition from book to screen could be more successful. However, Michael Caine (nominated for Oscar) proves once again he still ranks among top actors around, giving a full-circle performance of British journalist Thomas Fowler who covers hectic weeks of 1950's clashes in Vietnam. He strikes an unusual friendship with American Alden Pyle (played by typically clumsy Brendan Fraser) and by the time the cards between the two are finally on the table, Pyle is head over heels in love with Fowler's lover, a beautiful Vietnamese Phuong (Do Thi Hai Yen). The later developments concern deeply political, business, and even marital and psychological matters. It's maybe too a complex mosaic to cover, which ultimately makes the film rather forgettable. The movie is potent in conveying just about everything it wants to, but mostly it only skims the surface.

For those of us who slogged through the experience of Vietnam in the sixties, this superbly scripted, filmed, and produced latest version of the wonderfully ironic Graham Greene best-selling novel (an earlier black and white version made in the early 1960s starred Audie Murphy, who turned in a surprisingly professional performance) is a journey back into the heart of darkness, and a thoughtful re-examination of the surprisingly persistent contradiction that American foreign policy poses to the rest of the watching world. In terms that now have obvious parallels to our escalating involvement in Iraq, it openly questions the whole idea of the new American imperialism and how the rest of the civilized world sees it. What is even more gratifying about this film is that it gives Michael Caine yet another opportunity to flaunt his powerful acting abilities as the world weary but still committed British journalist, a man who comes to recognize both the fatal naivety and yet dangerously provocative impulses of a young and idealistic American Alden Pyle (played well by Brendan Fraser).This movie has an eerily prescient feel to it, given the fact that it was filmed and ready for distribution before 9/11, and consequently delayed for release until 2002, when the fervor of patriotic fervor over the approaching hostilities in Iraq blunted the moral sensibilities of many movie goers. In a script that is fairly faithful to the original Greene novel, one finds all of the superficial wide-eyed innocence and naivety the author found so dangerously paired with such a bland willingness toward provocative aggressive action. With unnerving calm and deliberation, Pyle sets into motion actions with calamitous consequences with a seeming child-like belief in his own ill-founded idealism and what he perceives to be the greater good that will necessarily flow from them. Needless to say, his confidence is both ill founded and wildly mistaken in its arrogant assumptions. In this sense, Pyle is the perfect allegorical representation for the dangerously irresponsible conduct of the country on whose behalf he acts.But the real show is Caine's, whose cynical, cautious and well-constructed life suddenly crashes into overdrive, leaving him no choice but to involve himself in the dangerously escalating political situation in an attempt to fend off Pyle's efforts to cuckold him with is gorgeous young Vietnamese mistress and expose Pyle's extralegal efforts to engineer a political coup. This is a marvelously sophisticated and yet eminently entertaining film that both accurately depicts a series of fact-based events important in the history of America's involvement in Vietnam and yet also raises interesting philosophical questions by offering us a detailed character study of an individual at the very margins of his endurance, forced to fight for everything his life means to him.

607995,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B00005JLXB,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[1, 1]","THE QUIET AMERICAN, Phillip Noyce's adaptation of the Graham Greene novel, is among that small subgenre of films (THE YEAR OF LIVING DANGEROUSLY, UNDER FIRE, SALVADOR) where journalists, writing in war-torn countries, discover conspiracies that undermine everything they've come to accept as true. These films are inevitably controversial, as they deal with actual places and historical events, and they demand an open mind, as they often portray governments in a less-than-flattering light. While the revelations of the stories aren't always entirely true, each film of this group are well-crafted, and certainly thought-provoking.The film is told as a flashback, as the corpse of murdered American Alden Pyle (Brendan Fraser) is found, floating in the Mekong, in 1952. During the French police investigation, the story unfolds...Thomas Fowler (Oscar-nominated Michael Caine) is a veteran British journalist (""I prefer reporter,"" he jokes), writing in Saigon as the French fought the Communists in Indochina. Jaded and complacent, he only sporadically submits an article, devoting his time to a mildly hedonistic lifestyle, and his beloved mistress, beautiful young Phuong (portrayed by the stunning, if not overly talented Vietnamese actress, Do Thi Hai Yen). When young Pyle arrives, purportedly joining the American mission to treat eye disease among the Vietnamese, the older man is immediately impressed by his quiet, respectful, almost naive innocence. Introducing the American to Phuong, Pyle is immediately attracted to her, and, upon discovering Fowler already has a wife, in England, he begins wooing the girl, much to the chagrin of the reporter.As his paper is threatening to return Fowler to England, taking him away from Phuong, he announces he is involved in a major story in the north, and leaves to investigate reports of Communist activities. What he finds is a massacre, with responsibility denied by both sides. Joined by Pyle (""I didn't want to propose to Phuong behind your back""), the pair barely make it back alive. Although the 'official' story blames the Communists for the deaths, Fowler doesn't believe it, and begins investigating in earnest.A new military leader emerges, General Th&eacute;, opposed to both the French and the Communists, and Caine suspects his forces as the true perpetrators of the massacre. Visiting the elusive general's headquarters, he finds Pyle running a clinic, and the General apoplectic when he asks who is providing the arms and funds for his army. Again, with Pyle's assistance, he barely escapes with his life...and a growing suspicion that the United States is taking a less than neutral role in the intrigue...While the film's climax will come as a surprise to no one, and the 'love triangle' lacks much spark (other than from Caine, who is totally believable when he confesses that without Phuong he would ""start to die""), the film is engrossing, throughout. Brendan Fraser, as the enigmatic title character, does a very credible job in a complex role, after a somewhat shaky first meeting with Caine. The lack of chemistry between him and Hai Yen could easily be explained away as a natural reticence from her character towards any man saying ""I love you"", in a society where sexual favors are easily purchased. She seems far more comfortable and believable in her scenes with Caine, despite their major age difference.Ultimately, the film is a triumph for Michael Caine, who again proves why he is one of the finest actors of his generation. As a man who goes from indifferent complacency to active participant by the film's climax, he is never less than superb.This is certainly one of the better films of 2002!",5,Caine Superb in Vietnamese Drama...,1060992000,"08 16, 2003",2003,3679,"['QUIET', 'AMERICAN', 'Phillip', 'Noyce', 'adaptation', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'novel', 'small', 'subgenre', 'films', 'YEAR', 'LIVING', 'DANGEROUSLY', 'UNDER', 'FIRE', 'SALVADOR', 'where', 'journalists', 'writing', 'war-torn', 'countries', 'discover', 'conspiracies', 'undermine', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'come', 'accept', 'true', 'films', 'are', 'inevitably', 'controversial', 'deal', 'actual', 'places', 'historical', 'events', 'demand', 'open', 'mind', 'often', 'portray', 'governments', 'less-than-flattering', 'light', 'revelations', 'stories', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'entirely', 'true', 'film', 'group', 'are', 'well-crafted', 'certainly', 'thought-provoking.The', 'film', 'told', 'flashback', 'corpse', 'murdered', 'American', 'Alden', 'Pyle', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'found', 'floating', 'Mekong', '1952', 'French', 'police', 'investigation', 'story', 'unfolds', 'Thomas', 'Fowler', 'Oscar-nominated', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'veteran', 'British', 'journalist', 'prefer', 'reporter', 'writing', 'Saigon', 'French', 'fought', 'Communists', 'Indochina', 'Jaded', 'complacent', 'only', 'sporadically', 'article', 'devoting', 'time', 'mildly', 'hedonistic', 'lifestyle', 'beloved', 'mistress', 'beautiful', 'young', 'Phuong', 'portrayed', 'stunning', 'not', 'overly', 'talented', 'Vietnamese', 'actress', 'Do', 'Thi', 'Hai', 'Yen', 'When', 'young', 'Pyle', 'purportedly', 'joining', 'American', 'mission', 'treat', 'eye', 'disease', 'Vietnamese', 'older', 'man', 'immediately', 'impressed', 'quiet', 'respectful', 'almost', 'naive', 'innocence', 'Introducing', 'American', 'Phuong', 'Pyle', 'immediately', 'attracted', 'discovering', 'Fowler', 'already', 'wife', 'England', 'wooing', 'girl', 'much', 'chagrin', 'reporter.As', 'paper', 'threatening', 'return', 'Fowler', 'England', 'taking', 'away', 'Phuong', 'involved', 'major', 'story', 'north', 'investigate', 'reports', 'Communist', 'activities', 'What', 'massacre', 'responsibility', 'denied', 'sides', 'Joined', 'Pyle', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'propose', 'Phuong', 'back', 'pair', 'barely', 'make', 'back', 'alive', ""'official"", 'story', 'Communists', 'deaths', 'Fowler', ""n't"", 'believe', 'investigating', 'earnest.A', 'new', 'military', 'leader', 'emerges', 'General', 'Th', 'eacute', 'opposed', 'both', 'French', 'Communists', 'Caine', 'forces', 'true', 'perpetrators', 'massacre', 'Visiting', 'elusive', 'general', 'headquarters', 'Pyle', 'running', 'clinic', 'General', 'apoplectic', 'when', 'who', 'providing', 'arms', 'funds', 'army', 'Again', 'Pyle', 'assistance', 'barely', 'life', 'growing', 'suspicion', 'United', 'States', 'taking', 'less', 'neutral', 'role', 'intrigue', 'film', 'climax', 'will', 'come', 'surprise', 'one', ""'love"", 'triangle', 'lacks', 'much', 'spark', 'other', 'Caine', 'who', 'totally', 'believable', 'when', 'Phuong', 'would', 'start', 'die', 'film', 'engrossing', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'enigmatic', 'title', 'character', 'very', 'credible', 'job', 'complex', 'role', 'somewhat', 'shaky', 'first', 'meeting', 'Caine', 'lack', 'chemistry', 'Hai', 'Yen', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'explained', 'away', 'natural', 'reticence', 'character', 'man', 'saying', 'love', 'society', 'where', 'sexual', 'favors', 'are', 'easily', 'purchased', 'far', 'more', 'comfortable', 'believable', 'scenes', 'Caine', 'major', 'age', 'difference.Ultimately', 'film', 'triumph', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'who', 'again', 'why', 'one', 'finest', 'actors', 'generation', 'man', 'who', 'indifferent', 'complacency', 'active', 'participant', 'film', 'climax', 'never', 'less', 'superb.This', 'certainly', 'one', 'better', 'films', '2002']",N/A

Erland,"[1, 1]","'The Quiet American' is a hauntingly tragic and beautifully told tale offering a glimpse of what was once the exotic 'Pearl of the Orient,' Vietnam prior to the death and devastation of the war-torn '60's. The opening sequence of Saigon at night draws the viewer into its flickering lights and surreal landscape and doesn't release you until the very end when we once again return to the same harbor setting leaving the beleaguered country to its inevitable fate.The year is 1952 and France is the colonial power battling the Chinese Communist for control of the country. For the most part the fighting is taking place in remote villages so life in the city goes on as though nothing is wrong. Thomas Fowler (Michael Caine) is a married, middle-aged British correspondent living in Saigon with a lovely young Vietnamese girl named Phuong (Do Thi Hai Yen). While they both have feelings for each other their relationship appears doomed to failure because Thomas' wife back in England refuses to grant him a divorce. The life and feelings shared betweem Thomas and Phuong can only be temporal in nature as the possiblity of being recalled back to London by his employer looms forever on the horizon.However things soon change with a sudden arrival of Alden Pyle (Brendan Fraser) a young American who falls in love with Phuong and wishes to marry her and take her back to the states.Their love triangle allegorically tells the story of Vietnam in microcosm. Phuong is Vietnam, fragile, lovely and without hope. Thomas (Europe) longs to possess her, but offers no hope for a brighter and secure future. Alden (America) seems to be her one hope for a long and happy life if she could only escape to the U.S.A. Alas, first impressions and heartfelt promises are not always what they seem to be. Alden has alterative motives in Vietnam that jeporadize not only his life but Phuong's hope of a new life.Michael Caine is brilliant as the self-absorbed Englishman who finally comes to grips with reality and realizes ""sooner or later one has to take sides if one is to remain human"" and Do Thi Hai Yen is an absolute dream as the enchanting Phoung.

Although Caine has rendered so many wonderful performances over his long career, this may be his finest.  The role offered him great range since this character churns up many conflicting emotions.  I didn't like the character very much in the beginning whereas Fraser's American seems very likeable.  But all is not as it seems and Caine's Thomas Fowler, a London journalist, is about to get his eyes opened wide to Vietnam during French control, shortly to be followed by American control.  Some viewers are calling this film primarily a love triangle and a love story since Caine and Fraser both love the same woman.  I'm not so sure.  I'm not even really sure that Fraser is in love with her. Rather, the principal characters are those played by Fraser and Caine and the real conflicts in the film initially arise from their clash over the woman.  But they are not just conflicted over the woman.  That's the surface of things.  Underneath they are both on the loose in Vietnam with their respective agendas.  At issue is whether either or both has any heart or feeling which exists under those agendas.  Amidst all the quiet drama of this movie, there is an explosive terrorist attack and that changes everything, including our perspectives of these two men.  The woman they have been fighting over becomes very secondary to me from that point forward.  These are not simplistic characters or an ordinary plotline.  I really like the complexity and layers of this work and Caine and Fraser are fully up to the task.  Director Noyce does a brilliant job of bringing this excellent work to the screen.  I hope Caine does get the Oscar.  As for Fraser, this is his best work since ""Gods and Monsters"" and I hope he gets his lead role that knocks everyone out shortly.

He says he modeled his performance on Graham Greene himself, with whom he was acquainted. Makes sense, since Fowler mirrors Greene in many ways. This is a much more direct adaptation than the earlier movie, which eradicated any trace of an anti-American slant. When the book was first published, it was described by some as profoundly anti-American, but I always felt that the politics were just the backdrop for the human story. These characters aren't walking allegories who represent their respective countries, although perhaps Pyle thinks he is.Brendan Fraser seems a great choice to play Pyle. He's good at playing naive, and Pyle's naivete becomes more ambiguous as we learn more about him. He captures the idealism as well, early on when he's clutching York Harding and discussing democracy with Fowler, and later when he tries with all his might to steal away Fowler's girl in a civil and gentlemanly fashion. ""The Quiet American"" is a movie in the tradition of great political thrillers like ""The Year of Living Dangerously"" and ""Under Fire"", movies that capture the political and the physical setting, but not at the expense of good characters and a well spun yarn.",4,Nice adaptation,1064361600,"09 24, 2003",2003,1377,"['Quiet', 'American', 'vast', 'improvement', 'Joseph', 'Mankiewicz', 'version', '50', 'years', 'ago', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'role', 'Thomas', 'Fowler', 'more', 'smoothly', 'possibly', 'other', 'ever', 'played', 'modeled', 'performance', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'whom', 'was', 'acquainted', 'Makes', 'sense', 'Fowler', 'mirrors', 'Greene', 'many', 'ways', 'much', 'more', 'direct', 'adaptation', 'earlier', 'movie', 'eradicated', 'trace', 'anti-American', 'slant', 'When', 'book', 'was', 'first', 'published', 'was', 'described', 'profoundly', 'anti-American', 'always', 'felt', 'politics', 'were', 'just', 'backdrop', 'human', 'story', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'walking', 'allegories', 'who', 'represent', 'respective', 'countries', 'perhaps', 'Pyle', 'thinks', 'Fraser', 'great', 'choice', 'play', 'Pyle', 'good', 'playing', 'naive', 'Pyle', 'naivete', 'more', 'ambiguous', 'learn', 'more', 'idealism', 'as', 'well', 'early', 'when', 'clutching', 'York', 'Harding', 'discussing', 'democracy', 'Fowler', 'later', 'when', 'might', 'steal', 'away', 'Fowler', 'girl', 'civil', 'gentlemanly', 'fashion', 'Quiet', 'American', 'movie', 'tradition', 'great', 'political', 'thrillers', 'Year', 'Living', 'Dangerously', 'Fire', 'movies', 'capture', 'political', 'physical', 'setting', 'not', 'expense', 'good', 'characters', 'well', 'spun', 'yarn']",N/A

We understand his love-lorn desperation. Ditto his porcelain doll mistress, and her desperation to survive the shifting sands of colonial Vietnam. Brendon Fraser too, looks every inch his OSS part, an idealistic frat-boy who took all the correct courses, saluted all the correct flags, and never learned a thing about the soul of subjugated peoples, at home or abroad. If these visuals are perfect, the lead performance is not. In short, Caine's Thomas Fowler has been wildly overpraised. In a part that cries out for civilized passion, he gives a lot of well-bred British civility, but very little passion. There are simply too many blank-eyed stares with not enough hint of the inner life that breeds conflicting emotions. Instead of interpreting the character, his scenes float on physical appearance and the richness of Greene's conception, a distinction too many folks have conflated. Thus the final act of betrayal, which should be the movie's payoff, is robbed of suspense and insight by a performance that fails to develop over time. I found myself wishing Bette Davis had directed his scenes.This is a good movie, but no unmitigated triumph. The Greenian complexities and ambiguities are mostly where they should be.  However, unlike the novel's narrative, exposition here at times suffers from heavy-handed repetition as other reviewers have pointed out -- the overstated wet cement, for one. Nonetheless, there's enough depth to convey the basic brilliance of the book, which remains a powerful interweaving of personal and political treachery. (The reviewer who likens this novel to those of Henry James provides an ironical insight.)Too bad this second version was denied to viewers of the bowdlerized 1958 version.

Graham Greene who wrote the book of the film was himself an Intelligence Officer for the British SIS, among other things. The attention to detail in the plot and the authenticity shows true to life precisely because of this. The book was Graham Greene's biography of sorts. He liked to cavort with nubile young women too. The movie was filmed on location in Vietnam and also in the Caravelle Hotel that I love, especially the Saigon-Saigon Bar on the rooftop.Michael is infatuated with a young, pretty, anaemic, somewhat brainless Vietnamese 'fille de joie' in Saigon. She is young enough to be his granddaughter and he has a Roman Catholic wife in London who won't divorce him. Obviously, he likes to live on the edge.Enter Alden Pyle, the quiet American. Is he all that he seems? Obviously not, he is on semi-official cover as an Medical AID worker. He falls for Phoung the Viet bimbo and fireworks begin. The eternal triangle all over again. Two men in love with one woman. Something has got to give or perhaps they might form a menage a trois??? Pyle saves Caine's life knowing that General The, the leader of the Third Force means to TWEP Fowler (Caine), but is he grateful? No way , baby, he betrays Pyle and just by standng at a window holding a black book, he gives the KILL order to the Vietminh communist cell. And get this, who is the leader of the communist Vietminh cell unit? None other than Caine's trusty right hand man and gopher. Never trust a subservient Oriental like him as he might just stab you in the back, literally. However, Caine's assistant and his motley crew of Vietminh terrorists corner Pyle in a dark, back alley and that's the end of Pyle. Knifed in the guts. Looks like he passed bottom of his class in hand to hand combat at The Farm. Caine even sets up Pyle by luring him to a dinner at the Vieux Moulin but the table is set for one. What an evil creepo. Fowler is as guilty as the Vietminh commie killers. The French Police Officer knows but has insufficient evidence. When questioned, Fowler says, ""There's a war on. People are dying all the time...""Pyle dies horribly, but what the hell? He was a Company man and he did his job, for Freedom and the American dream. That was his job...to prowl the dark alleys of the world doing things no one else wanted to do or had the guts to do, for Freedom and Liberty. And so the Greek tragedy ends with Caine and Phoung. Will they end happily? I think not, what goes around comes around. They'll get their just desserts, maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow but soon and for the rest of their unhappy lives. It's Karma and God will give us Justice.To all you VN vets out there and especially SOG CCN, Some gave all, some gave much, all gave their very best. War is Hell!

Not many of us have like to consider that perhaps less nobler motives were also at work: not hegemonic neo-colonialism as an outgrowth of anti-Communist paranoia, but rather anti-Communist paranoia as an excuse and cover for hegemonic neo-colonialism.So in the same way, the film leaves open the question whether the CIA agent which the title describes is really acting upon misguided good intentions and had no idea that the South Vietnamese thugs he was smuggling military aid to were corrupt terrorists and wannabe tyrants, or whether he had a completely Machiavellian attitude about building a case for American intervention by any means necessary.Thus the title itself is arresting: The *Quiet* American.

Understated, skillful performances from the principal actors (Michael Caine as jaded, aging news correspondent Thomas Fowler and Brendan Fraser as optimistic, single-minded American aid worker Alden Pyle). Not is all as it first seems. I was most impressed by Fraser, who has unfortunately not delivered enough of these serious, dramatic performances in his career although it is perfectly clear that he is capable. His nuanced performance masks the secrets his character is carrying, while Caine, the narrator, finds himself bitter and jealous... before Alden Pyle came along and became a romantic rival to Caine's Fowler, Fowler had very few cares. He was content living in Southeast Asia with his beautiful young mistress Phuong, sending in the occasional article to the newspaper employing him and smoking a healthy share of opium. His attitude throughout smacks of condescension, he is so convinced of his rightness, status and position for so much of the story. His entitlement, for example, to have a wife back home AND to keep a mistress in Vietnam, not seeing any real problem with that. Perhaps he suffers delusions from the excessive opium? In any case, Pyle makes it clear he is in love with Phuong, and a romantic rivalry of sorts ensues. Fowler is powerless to do much of anything because he cannot offer to marry Phuong. Meanwhile more sinister aspects of Fowler are revealed as he insists on keeping his status quo.Naturally the story and characters are a good deal more complex than this. Without going on at length or running the risk of ruining the story's abundant detail, not much more can be said.

Lewis ""DP Fred""","[0, 0]","Unlike the 1958 Joseph Mankiewicz version of Graham Greene's novel, this effort remains true to Green's intent.In the late 1940's and early 1950's, in the aftermath of World War II, the wide distribution of the tenets of existential philosophy led to concern by writers about the moral responsiblity of &#34;engagement&#34; (in politics) rather than remaining aloof from worldly concerns by producing &#34;Art for art's sake.&#34;Thomas Fowler (the great Caine) remains aloof from politics, a stance rationalized by his need as a professional journalist to remain objective.  He is a foreign correspondent for a London newspaper; far from home, he has found a cul-de-sac in the obscure colonial outpost of  French Indochina ideal for quietism.He is jolted out of his complacency (for the Catholic Greene, a nudge from God) by unwanted interference from the Quiet American, an idealistic young man (actually CIA) who disrupts Fowerl's relationship with his mistress Phuong; and Fowler's staid existence in Saigon as well by engineering a &#34;third force&#34; separate from the French colonial administration and the Viet Minh insurgents.When the &#34;third force&#34; blows up a cafe in downtown Saigon, wounding and killing a number of Fowler's Vietnamese friends, he begins to investigate the Quiet American in detail.  What he learns leads him to take drastic action, to become &#34;engaged,&#34; but leaving him with what Sartre termed &#34;Dirty hands&#34; - the inevitable consequence of making choices in an imperfect world.Women may find the relationship between Fowler and Phuong questionable; why would such a young woman continue with a man twice her age?  On a symbolic level, it represents a deep union of long-established civilizations, European and Vietnamese, as opposed to the brash naivete of post-war American superpower.  Compare works of Henry James in which energetic Americans rub up against phlegmatic English.The explosion scene is particularly good - a model for other filmmakers how to use special effects to further mood, narrative, and theme, rather than as a form of hamburger helper or jalapeno sauce to distract from thin content.",4,Prophetic warning about Vietnam,1366761600,"04 24, 2013",2013,2162,"['1958', 'Joseph', 'Mankiewicz', 'version', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'novel', 'effort', 'true', 'Green', 'intent.In', 'late', '1940', 'early', '1950', 'aftermath', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'wide', 'distribution', 'tenets', 'existential', 'philosophy', 'led', 'concern', 'writers', 'moral', 'responsiblity', '34', 'engagement', '34', 'politics', 'rather', 'remaining', 'aloof', 'worldly', 'concerns', 'producing', '34', 'Art', 'art', 'sake.', '34', 'Thomas', 'Fowler', 'great', 'Caine', 'aloof', 'politics', 'stance', 'rationalized', 'need', 'professional', 'journalist', 'remain', 'objective', 'foreign', 'correspondent', 'London', 'newspaper', 'far', 'home', 'found', 'cul-de-sac', 'obscure', 'colonial', 'outpost', 'French', 'Indochina', 'ideal', 'quietism.He', 'jolted', 'complacency', 'Catholic', 'Greene', 'nudge', 'God', 'unwanted', 'interference', 'Quiet', 'American', 'idealistic', 'young', 'man', 'actually', 'CIA', 'who', 'disrupts', 'Fowerl', 'relationship', 'mistress', 'Phuong', 'Fowler', 'staid', 'existence', 'Saigon', 'as', 'well', 'engineering', '34', 'third', 'force', '34', 'separate', 'French', 'colonial', 'administration', 'Viet', 'Minh', '34', 'third', 'force', '34', 'up', 'cafe', 'downtown', 'Saigon', 'wounding', 'killing', 'number', 'Fowler', 'Vietnamese', 'friends', 'investigate', 'Quiet', 'American', 'detail', 'What', 'take', 'drastic', 'action', 'become', '34', 'engaged', '34', 'leaving', 'what', 'Sartre', 'termed', '34', 'Dirty', '34', 'inevitable', 'consequence', 'making', 'choices', 'imperfect', 'world.Women', 'may', 'find', 'relationship', 'Fowler', 'Phuong', 'questionable', 'why', 'would', 'such', 'young', 'woman', 'continue', 'man', 'twice', 'age', 'symbolic', 'level', 'deep', 'union', 'long-established', 'civilizations', 'European', 'Vietnamese', 'opposed', 'brash', 'naivete', 'post-war', 'American', 'superpower', 'Compare', 'Henry', 'James', 'energetic', 'Americans', 'rub', 'up', 'phlegmatic', 'English.The', 'explosion', 'scene', 'particularly', 'good', 'model', 'other', 'filmmakers', 'how', 'use', 'special', 'effects', 'further', 'mood', 'narrative', 'theme', 'rather', 'form', 'hamburger', 'helper', 'jalapeno', 'sauce', 'distract', 'thin', 'content']",N/A

There is no subtlety, nothing clever or new, and absolutely nothing to challenge the viewer.Examples:1) The Voice-Over Narration - Throughout the movie we have Michael Caine spelling out for us exactly what is happening and how his character feels about it, just in case the audience isn't quite clever enough to figure it out.A narrator shouldn't have to tell us, &quot;I was surprised to find that I was actually quite pleased to see Pyle once again...&quot; The actor should convey that information through his ACTING.2) The close-ups of important information - We see about four different close-ups of a spot where Pyle steps so that, later in the movie, someone can observe that Pyle had visited Caine because he has some wet cement on his shoe. It's so obvious and overly set-up, they might as well have had Michael Caine's narration voice tell us, &quot;Now, pay close attention to that spot where Pyle is stepping. It's important.&quot;3) The lead actress has no character at all - Both men are supposed to be in love with her, yet she displays no personality at all, aside from &quot;young and sexy,&quot; which isn't really a personality. Why are they both so in love with her? It's really painful.Particularly excruciating is the scene where the two men are hanging out in a bunker together, talking about how much they both love her, and Michael Caine tells Pyle &quot;I've recently introduced her to the music of Bach,&quot; like she's a pet that he's training.If you like strong or interesting female characters, give this movie a pass.4) The slow-motion running through bloody chaos with mouth hanging open scene - Yup. They have a couple of these. The worst one is after a bomb has gone off and we see Michael Caine running through the area, sobbing, staring at all the death and destruction. It's SO Hollywood and SO cliche that it becomes almost funny.And then, just in case you still haven't gotten that this was a BAD thing, the next scene is Michael Caine describing the scene to someone else and we see the footage once again, as he describes it.

Though many consider THE QUIET AMERICAN as more of a memoir than a novel (Graham Greene lived in Saigon in the early 1950's and had first hand information on the trying situation of the French/Communist/Vietnamese patriot poitics and military struggles for power), yet Greene develops his characters with his usual acuity, creating a story with more than mere political drivers.  The main character, Thomas Fowler (one of Michael Caine's finest moments on film) is a British journalist/opium-smoking man of the woodwork whose life is given meaning only by his Vietnamese lover (subtly underplayed by Do Thi Hai Yen). His life is given a wakeup call with the arrival of a quiet, unassuming, gentle American (Brendan Fraser, again a fine perfomance)who falls in love with Fowler's lover, and slowly is unmasked as being less than 'quiet' when his connection to the American CIA becomes evident.  The theme is discovering what is important, significant and meaningful in a world on the brink and to say more would diminish the impact of this finely wrought movie.  Beautifully photographed and scored, the film remains small in its poignancy and never gives in to the seduction of becoming yet another big war movie.  The cast is unifromly outstanding: Tzi Ma as Hinh, Fowler's office assistant and confidant, and all the other actors stay credible and multifacted, never becoming stereotypes.

Personally, I don't think so. Graham was anti-American and pro-communism. Did that influence him? Sure it did. Did he consciously go about writing a political thriller foretelling the defeat of the French and then American military involvement in Indochina? I don't think so.

There are essentially five plots. The first three are aired, in part, at the outset of the film. The first: a man is killed, stabbed to death and tossed into the water in 1952 Vietnam; was Michael Caine involved in the murder? He tells the police that he was not near the site of the killing; but he may nevertheless be involved. Second, who is this American? Why did he come to Vietnam during a time when the French are battling against the communists? Third, Caine, with concern and feeling, tells a Vietnamese lovely young woman that the murdered man loved her, and she indicates that she knew this. We begin to realize that there was a sexual triangle with both Caine and the murdered American loving the woman. Fourth, we see that Caine is much older than the young Vietnamese woman and we begin to understand that one aspect of the film would be to explore the life of Caine, an aging British reporter who only submitted three articles to his English newspaper during the past year. The fifth plot is the horrors of the French-Vietnamese war and the reactions of Caine and others to it.

Perskie ""ceruleana""","[10, 13]","Rarely does a novel translate well into a screen production. &quot;The Quiet American&quot; proves to be the exception to the rule. Philip Noyce and his team have brilliantly adapted Graham Greene's historical novel about Vietnam, during the waning days of French colonialism and the beginning of American intervention, into a powerful film. The book was published in 1955 and foreshadowed America's war in Vietnam. Kudos go to Michael Caine, who certainly deserves an Oscar for his spectacular performance.The movie is set in Saigon during 1952. Thomas Fowler, (Michael Caine), a cynical, veteran correspondent for The London Times is our narrator. Fowler has &quot;gone native.&quot; He has fallen in love with Vietnam and with Phoung, a one-time bar hostess who is young enough to be his daughter. Enter Alden Pyle, (Brendan Fraser), a seemingly innocuous, somewhat bumbling American who supposedly works for the US Economic Aid Mission, specializing in eye diseases. The two men meet and become friends until Pyle intrudes on Fowler's love affair.Tension builds as this triangle becomes more intense, and as the war between the French and the Communists is joined by a third party, a Vietnamese general, backed by the Americans.  Fowler, who has long remained indifferent to the conflict is finally forced to take sides. Pyle is drastically transformed from a &quot;quiet&quot; American to a skilled  CIA operator, willing to condone the deaths of innocents for long term political interests.This is an intensely passionate film. The love both Fowler and Pyle feel for Phuong, (played by the incredibly lovely Do Thi Hai Yen) transforms both men. In one scene, when Fowler realizes his potential loss, he says, &quot;The fear of losing Phoung is more terrifying than any bullet. If I lose her, it would be the beginning of death.&quot; And it is a film passionate about the war being fought on the streets of Saigon and in the villages. Director Noyce is able to portray the conflict in simple enough terms without taking a strong political stance. This film is anti-war not anti-American.Graham Greene's haunting and elegant narrative comes to life here. The photography eloquently captures the steamy beauty of Saigon, the glorious tropical countryside, the serenity of Phoung's face in close-up, the chaos of a bomb-torn street and the horror of a village massacre.

Both The Quiet American and Rabbit-Proof Fence were critical successes (though neither made a ton of money), and they both rank among the best movies of 2002.  The Quiet American is based on a novel by Graham Greene.  Michael Caine was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor.The movie is set in 1952 Vietnam.  Thomas Fowler (Michael Caine) is a British reporter for the London Times living and working in Vietnam.  Thomas is comfortable living his life, and living with a Vietnamese woman named Phuong (Do Thi Hai Yen).  At the beginning of the movie Thomas is brought in to identify a dead body.  He recognizes the body and says that the man was a friend.  The dead man is Alden Pyle (Brendan Fraser).  Pyle is an American aid worker (Fowler calls him a quiet American).  Much of the rest of the movie is flashback of Fowler remembering Pyle.Pyle is an earnest younger man.  He believes that communism needs to be rolled back and eliminated from Vietnam.  Pyle is very idealistic and believes that the French will not be able to bring freedom and democracy to Vietnam, and that America must be the country to do so.  Fowler is skeptical and somewhat jaded in his view of Vietnam and the world.  Despite their differences, the two men become friends.  The Quiet American is the clash of two cultures (new world America vs old world Vietnam, or Colonialistic England vs the colony), and it is also a story about two men in love with the same woman.Shortly after Pyle meets Fowler, he also meets Fowler's girlfriend, Phuong.  They are introduced and they dance (they are at a club).  Pyle falls for Phuong and this sets up the main conflict between Pyle and Fowler: Phuong.  Despite the fact that Fowler knows that Pyle desires Phuong, and that their political ideologies are so different, they remain friends.  The movie explores the relationship between Pyle, Fowler, and Phuong, and uses this relationship as a metaphor for the interactions of America, England, and Vietnam.  It is effective, if you stop and think about it after the movie ends.The Quiet American is a slow moving movie, and I don't think it is quite as powerful or effective as Noyce's Rabbit-Proof Fence.  Michael Caine does an excellent job and was deservedly nominated for an Oscar.  Brendan Fraser also does a good job in the movie and reminds me that he can be a very good actor when given the opportunity.

France is in the process of being tossed out of Indochina, but the former doesn't realize it yet - Dien Bien Phu is still in the future - and its military fights on ineffectually against the communists. In the meantime, Fowler submits the occasional story to the head office while finding comfort in the arms of opium and his Vietnamese mistress Phuong (Do Hai Yen), a former taxi dancer at a local club. Then, one day, THE QUIET AMERICAN Alden Pyle (Brendan Fraser) shows up. Pyle claims to be with a medical aid mission in country to combat trachoma, a bacterial disease causing blindness. But what is Pyle, really? He seems awfully chummy with the conniving powers over at the U.S. legation. In any case, Alden very soon falls in love with Phuong, attention that neither the jealous Fowler can prevent nor Phuong finds particularly unwelcome.Not since LITTLE VOICE (1998) has Michael Caine acted so powerfully, and this is perhaps his greatest role ever. An Academy Award nomination is deservedly due. Fraser is perfect as the clean-cut, idealistic and nave Yank who may be something other than he claims. Yen is positively exquisite as the delicate Phuong. As Fowler puts it, his death would begin if he lost her.THE QUIET AMERICAN, based on the Graham Greene novel, can be seen as an allegorical story of America's fledgling interest in succoring Vietnam from the Red Menace. After all, the French seem unequal to the task. Pyle perhaps comes to symbolically represent the American innocence that is seduced by Vietnam in the form of Phuong, and the former wishes ""to save"" the latter from the escalating national chaos. Only the tired and world-weary Fowler knows that this is impossible. He would ""save"" Phuong himself if he could, but he can't.THE QUIET AMERICAN is an anti-war, anti-intervention film best viewed these many years after America withdrew from its Southeast Asian debacle and passions have cooled.

Also, the World War two had ended not a decade before, and the world is being divided between ""who's with USA and who's with USSR"".In this scenario, Michael Caine is Thomas Fowler, a british journalist based in Saigon during Vietnam's struggle for independence. He has a vietnamese lover, the beautiful Phuong, and he's thorn between the life he had before in UK and the new life he could have with the young asian woman.Then, Fowler (Caine) receives a message from his newspaper in England, telling him to go back because he's not writing that much in Vietnam. And that's when he meets Alden Pyle (Brendan Fraser), the ""quiet american"", working for the medical assistance in Vietnam, but who seems much more than he's willing to tell.Phillip Noyce, as we can see from his other movies (""Patriot games"", ""Clear and present danger"", ""Dead calm"", ""The bone collector"") is a director that can build up tension almost from nowhere and using simple situations and takes. He uses movements from the actors, simple lines and gestures, to create a huge thrilling sensation in the viewer. Of course, there are some violent and explosive scenes in ""The quiet american"", but these are the obvious action situations; this movie is excellent because of its subtlety in creating a thrilling atmosphere. That's why I think Noyce was the perfect choice for directing a movie based on a novel by Graham Greene, who is a master in creating subtle and indirect thrillers in his books.Michael Caine is always a surprise: I wonder why an actor with his talent, capable of performances such as the one in this movie and Dr. Larch in ""Cider house rules"" still says ""yes"" to roles in movies such as Stallone's ""Get Carter"". Anyway, this is, in my opinion, his best performance ever.

Both movies filmed in Viet Nam adding to the authenticity.The Quiet American covers the period just before US 'advisors' were in place.For those unfamiliar with the history of the Viet Nam war, Ho Chi Minh actually worked for the United States OSS during WWII. The deal was that he ran intelligence for the Americans against the Japanese, in exchange that the United States would help him get the French out after the war. As usual, with American promises, this one was broken too. When the French finally left Indochina /Viet Nam, the United States supported highly corrupt politicians, backed with fewer than 1,000 American military 'advisors'. President Eisenhower was not interested in a full blown war against the 'communists'. When Kennedy became president, he upped the number of US military, then under Johnson we were finally in a full blown military action.The Hotel Majestic still survives from this period with little external alteration.

608035,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B00005JLXB,K. Driscoll,"[12, 14]","The Quiet American is a film based on the Graham Greene novel ofthe same nameand his characters here have some shades of the characters in his novella-turned-screenplayThe Third Man.  In many ways The Quiet American is as true to Green's literary work as The Third Man is, and I would even say that it is as good as theThe Third Man.  Perhaps it is just that the quality of our present audience has diminished?  This is the second film adaptation of Greene's The Quiet American.  This version is as daring as the novel is in retrospect and it is without question light years away from the propagandist elements presented in the shameful1958 version.  Unfortunately the Quiet American was quiet at the box office and failed miserably.  More shame, as it is in my humble view one of the best films in the last ten years.The film is set in Saigon in the early 1950s.  It takes place right at the end of the First Indochina War but, like the novel, its political snaps are not at the forefront because they are not necessarily intentional, they are assumed. That is probably because only someone lost in the fog of patriotism would dispute them as facts.  But the Quiet American is actually a love story.  It is about and narrated by, Thomas Fowler (Michael Caine), a British journalist at the twilight of his life hanging onto his youth by falling for a young Vietnamese girl named Phuong.  Enter his contrast; Alden Plyle (Brendan Fraser), a naive but educated young American who falls for Phuong and offers her what he sees within his strong moral code as a far better life.  That same moral code is tested considerably but to Director Phillip Noyce's credit, I never see Pyle as a villain and likewise to Fraser's credit, as he plays Pyle as if he could proudly be him fifty years ago. Unlike Greene's novel, the film's ending is more politically charged, but I bought into it and it meshed well with the film overall.  I don't want to reveal more than that for those who haven't read the novel or seen the movie but it is a fantastic film full of absolutely outstanding performances.  The film almost stands in opposition of the 1958 version but in doing so, it is far more consistent with Greene's novel.It is important to note that the performance of Michael Caine is one of the best I'd seen in years (he was nominated for an Oscar but lost to Adrien Brody for his work inThe Pianist).  Caine bounds about in this kind of half-alive state from scene to scene, but downplays it just enough that we believe him as a survivor.  He is such an amazing actor that easily slips under one's radar by putting together such simple and restrained performances.  He is rarely melodramatic and has never been picky about screenplays, but for me his performances remind me more of real life than almost anyone.  Brendan Fraser is also great for many of the same reasons and he also happens to play a cartoon buffoon in nine out of ten roles he chooses.  So what?  In a rare feature role within a great film, Fraser is absolutely perfect.Finally, this is a beautifully shot film and was done so on location in Vietnam.  Not a common occurrence for sure, and Noyce is kind to soak it in for us.  There is something about this film that gives me hope, not in love or war, but in big business filmmaking for taking such a fair and worldly view on a tale worth telling in the cinema once again.

During the 1950s when the French were protecting their colonial Vietnam, Thomas Fowler (Michael Caine), a British reporter meets the young quiet American, Dr. Pyle, in Saigon.  Dr. Pyle is an idealist that believes that he can help cure the Vietnamese of glaucoma when he meets Phuong (Hai Yen), Mr. Fowler's mistress.  Dr. Pyle falls in love at first sight, and seeks Mr. Fowlers approval of his pursuit for Phuong.  In the middle of this love triangle the communists are stepping up their attacks against the French colonial empire and the French also lose control of one of their officers as he is rising his own army for the Vietnamese people.  These fractions all seem to merge with Mr. Fowler, Dr. Pyle, and Phuong.  The Quiet American is a cynical love story set in a highly explosive environment where the setting is affecting the characters choices as well as their actions.

608037,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B00005JLXB,Lee Armstrong,"[2, 2]","""The Quiet American"" never made it to movie theatres where I live despite the Oscar nomination for Michael Caine.  The buzz was that this was a big anti-war film, which was just not going to be well received in the South.  All through the film, I kept expecting some major political statement.  Yes, Brendan Fraser's character Alden Fowler did blow up women and children and blame it on the communists.  However, in an age where one president of the United States says that there are weapons of mass destruction which then no one can find, and another says, ""I did not have sex with that woman,"" the idea that Americans only tell the truth is a bit outdated.  For me, the hubbub of the political slant of this film misrepresents the viewing experience.Instead, there is a quiet quality throughout this movie.  It is intensely character based.  Michael Caine as London Times' reporter Fowler who is hanging onto his love affair with the young Phuong is touchingly pathetic.  Caine plays this to the hilt, even breaking down in sobs at one point.  Perhaps we did need to see more of a connection between Pyle & Fowler to see why these two remained friends, despite the shifts in their love triangle.  Fraser is so likeable, that it is hard to believe he really manufactured bombs that shatter the Saigon streets.  It was helpful to see his corpse at the beginning of the film, and then have the story play out in flashback; because otherwise we would have been rooting for true love to win.  Do Thi Hai Yen as Phong is kind of a stick puppet, showing little emotion or connection to either man, kind of the classic Vietnamese tool of the Western imperialists.  (Maybe that was the political statement.)  Her sister played by Pham Thi Mai Hua is excellent as the stern judgmental elder protectress.Cinematographer Christopher Doyle who has shot many Asian films and the charming Australian flick ""Rabbit Proof Fence"" creates Vietnam in the most cinematically magical terms possible, with the opening and closing shots being gorgeous.  Phillip Noyce who has directed ""Clear & Present Danger"" & ""Patriot Games"" tells this tale with a slow careful pacing that allows the focus to be on the characters' internal development.  ""The Quiet American"" is not a flashy action war flick or even an anti-American political statement as advertised, it is rather a well-told tale, technically brilliant with memorable performances.

First, he gets the feeling that his paper will recall him back to London unless he can get a story to write about, and then he meets a young American man, a quiet friendly chap. Caine, the American, and the mistress go dancing, and quicker than you can say, well, whatever, the American informs Caine that he is in love with the girl and wishes to save her from her relationship with Caine by marrying her. To say any more would get close to spoiling the movie, because it is actually something of a thriller, once Caine gets wind of a story to report and meets the person he least expects to see up there.I didn't know WHAT to expect at this movie, but I must say I enjoyed myself tremendously. In the past, I've always made a point of steering clear of ""Vietnam War"" movies, but this movie is filmed on location in that country, and I must say, it's breathtakingly beautiful. Caine, as I've written above, is just aces, and Brandon Fraser, the American, is pretty good too. The one person I'm not so keen on is the mistress, who seems rather passive to me. I didn't get the impression that she loved Anyone, Caine or Fraser. I can understand that perhaps she's a metaphor for the country being fought over by old world imperialists and new word anti-communists, but I just didn't find her appealing. I wouldn't have bothered to strike up a conversation with her, let alone fight over her.But, there's a lot more to ""The Quiet American"" than that, so never fear, go see it and be amazed by Caine and scenery.",5,Michael Caine Stacks Up Another One,1048723200,"03 27, 2003",2003,2018,"['Well', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'certainly', 'not', 'going', 'have', 'make', 'excuses', 'career', 'hereafter', 'always', 'do', 'excellent', 'job', 'matter', 'what', 'Quiet', 'American', 'exception', 'either.Here', 'Caine', 'British', 'journalist', 'living', 'Vietnam', 'who', 'apparently', ""n't"", 'done', 'much', 'writing', 'past', 'year', 'so', 'years-younger', 'Vietnamese', 'mistress', 'more', 'less', 'existence', '1950s', 'Vietnam', 'Then', 'things', 'begin', 'change', 'bit', 'First', 'feeling', 'paper', 'will', 'recall', 'back', 'London', 'can', 'get', 'story', 'write', 'then', 'young', 'American', 'man', 'quiet', 'friendly', 'chap', 'Caine', 'American', 'mistress', 'go', 'dancing', 'quicker', 'can', 'say', 'well', 'whatever', 'American', 'informs', 'Caine', 'love', 'girl', 'wishes', 'save', 'relationship', 'Caine', 'marrying', 'say', 'more', 'would', 'get', 'close', 'spoiling', 'movie', 'actually', 'something', 'thriller', 'once', 'Caine', 'wind', 'story', 'report', 'person', 'see', 'up', 'there.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'WHAT', 'expect', 'movie', 'must', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'tremendously', 'past', ""'ve"", 'always', 'made', 'point', 'steering', 'clear', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'movies', 'movie', 'filmed', 'location', 'country', 'must', 'say', 'breathtakingly', 'beautiful', 'Caine', ""'ve"", 'written', 'just', 'aces', 'Brandon', 'Fraser', 'American', 'pretty', 'good', 'too', 'one', 'person', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'keen', 'mistress', 'who', 'rather', 'passive', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'impression', 'loved', 'Anyone', 'Caine', 'Fraser', 'can', 'understand', 'perhaps', 'metaphor', 'country', 'being', 'fought', 'over', 'old', 'world', 'imperialists', 'new', 'word', 'anti-communists', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'appealing', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'bothered', 'strike', 'up', 'conversation', 'let', 'alone', 'fight', 'her.But', 'lot', 'more', 'Quiet', 'American', 'so', 'never', 'fear', 'go', 'see', 'be', 'amazed', 'Caine', 'scenery']",N/A

At this point in the war, there are few Americans and Britishers in Vietnam, and Caine and Fraser at least both speak English. Caine is great as the indifferent and world-weary foreign correspondant, whose only passion, it seems, is for the girl. Fraser, who might at first blush appear a poor choice for the role, is actually quite good as the U.S. medical mission member who is supposedly there to help with the treatment of trachoma, a common cause of blindness in third-world countries, and easily  treatable. But there is more to Fraser's character than meets the eye, as Caine finds out, who suspects Fraser is part of a CIA plot to supply diolacton, which can be used to make plastic explosives, to a Vietnamese general who the U.S. hopes will eventually take over south Vietnam. Despite his initial aloofness from the conflict, Caine is eventually forced to take sides, which leads to the climax of the film, which I won't spoil for you here. I thought the film captured the pre-U.S. ambience of Saigon quite well, with its French restaurants, sidewalk cafes, opium dens and parlors, and bordellos.

That's a shame, as it presents a true love story from a period of time in a place largely ignored - 1952 Vietnam. Thomas Fowler (Michael Caine) is a married British journalist who is in love with a beautiful young Vietnamese woman and writes for the British press. He has found his true paradise. Director Philip Noyce is able to bring out the humid, romantic nuance of war-torn Vietnam. An American physician named Alden Pyle (Brendan Fraser) appears out of nowhere and confesses his love for Fowler's lover. What ensues is a seemingly gentlemanly sparring for the affections of Phuong (Do Thi Hai Yen). As the story unfolds, we find that Pyle is not all he seems, Fowler is less lazy than previously thought and Phuong is torn (with lots of help from her selfish sister).

A very few try to show the war from the inside out, what it means to retain one's inner sense of humanity even if the rest of us are losing ours.  In THE QUIET AMERICAN, director Phillip Noyce portrays the Vietnam of 1952 that differed only from the next decade's American-Vietnamese conflict of virtues in that here the focus is on the French-Vietnamese version, which, as we soon see, is no difference at all.In the sweltering Saigon that suffers from daily terrorist bombs, British journalist Thomas Fowler (Michael Caine) is trying to juggle numerous personal and professional balls but keeps dropping them.  He is married to a London-based wife who refuses to divorce him, forcing him to lie in order to keep his twenty-something Vietnamese mistress Phuong (Do Thi Hai Yen), who loves him but has to think about her future.  Fowler's boss in London threatens to recall him unless he comes up with a blockbuster news story.  Into this cauldron comes a medical exporting executive Alden Pyle (Brendan Fraser), who is not what he seems to be, either morally or politically.  Pyle falls in love with Phuong, who has to choose between an older man who can offer no security and a younger one who can.  While all this personal angst is going on, the Vietnam around them is collapsing and is being ripped apart by the French who are exiting and the Americans who are entering.  Complicating matters is that a local Vietnamese warlord is trying to establish his personal fiefdom, using illegal supplies from America.  In such a climate,no one and nothing is what it seems.Over the years Michael Caine has had many fine roles, but in his portrayal of the aging but wise journalist, he surely has one of his best.  Caine's Fowler has seen politics and politicians up close, and he knows that for him to do his job, he has to maintain a professional distance.  His problem is that the better he does his job the less human he becomes.  His aide, a Vietnamese subtly underplayed by Tzi Ma, reminds him of this in one scene, and the audience in another.  Brendon Fraser as Pyle is not the nutty or action star of his recent movies.  Here is an older, more jowly, and definitely the establishment type that in earlier roles he either caricatured or ridiculed.  Fraser's Pyle has his own agenda which is not limited to stealing another man's mistress.THE QUIET AMERICAN is one of the best movies of the year because it shows how individuals caught up in a constantly changing political environment are forced to retrench so that they can relearn exactly what, at one time, must have made them feel human.",5,Some Times You Have to Take a Side Just to be Human,1059868800,"08 3, 2003",2003,2682,"['Most', 'films', 'deal', 'Vietnam', 'show', 'miltary', 'aspect', 'fighting', 'men', 'conflict', 'very', 'few', 'try', 'show', 'war', 'inside', 'out', 'what', 'retain', 'one', 'inner', 'sense', 'humanity', 'even', 'rest', 'are', 'losing', 'ours', 'QUIET', 'AMERICAN', 'director', 'Phillip', 'Noyce', 'Vietnam', '1952', 'differed', 'only', 'next', 'decade', 'American-Vietnamese', 'conflict', 'virtues', 'here', 'focus', 'French-Vietnamese', 'version', 'soon', 'see', 'difference', 'sweltering', 'Saigon', 'suffers', 'daily', 'terrorist', 'bombs', 'British', 'journalist', 'Thomas', 'Fowler', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'trying', 'juggle', 'numerous', 'personal', 'professional', 'balls', 'dropping', 'married', 'London-based', 'wife', 'who', 'divorce', 'forcing', 'lie', 'order', 'keep', 'twenty-something', 'Vietnamese', 'mistress', 'Phuong', 'Do', 'Thi', 'Hai', 'Yen', 'who', 'think', 'future', 'Fowler', 'boss', 'London', 'threatens', 'recall', 'up', 'blockbuster', 'news', 'story', 'cauldron', 'medical', 'exporting', 'executive', 'Alden', 'Pyle', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'who', 'not', 'what', 'be', 'morally', 'politically', 'Pyle', 'love', 'Phuong', 'who', 'choose', 'older', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'offer', 'security', 'younger', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'personal', 'angst', 'going', 'Vietnam', 'collapsing', 'being', 'ripped', 'apart', 'French', 'who', 'are', 'exiting', 'Americans', 'who', 'are', 'entering', 'Complicating', 'matters', 'local', 'Vietnamese', 'warlord', 'trying', 'establish', 'personal', 'fiefdom', 'using', 'illegal', 'supplies', 'America', 'such', 'climate', 'one', 'nothing', 'what', 'seems.Over', 'years', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'had', 'many', 'fine', 'roles', 'portrayal', 'aging', 'wise', 'journalist', 'surely', 'one', 'best', 'Caine', 'Fowler', 'seen', 'politics', 'politicians', 'up', 'close', 'do', 'job', 'maintain', 'professional', 'distance', 'problem', 'better', 'job', 'less', 'human', 'aide', 'Vietnamese', 'subtly', 'underplayed', 'Tzi', 'Ma', 'one', 'scene', 'audience', 'Brendon', 'Fraser', 'Pyle', 'not', 'nutty', 'action', 'star', 'recent', 'movies', 'Here', 'older', 'more', 'jowly', 'definitely', 'establishment', 'type', 'earlier', 'roles', 'either', 'caricatured', 'ridiculed', 'Fraser', 'Pyle', 'own', 'agenda', 'not', 'limited', 'stealing', 'man', 'mistress.THE', 'QUIET', 'AMERICAN', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'year', 'how', 'individuals', 'caught', 'up', 'constantly', 'changing', 'political', 'environment', 'are', 'forced', 'retrench', 'so', 'can', 'relearn', 'exactly', 'what', 'one', 'time', 'must', 'have', 'made', 'feel', 'human']",N/A

[The best remains 1949's ""The Third Man"".] It is immeasurably enhanced by Michael Caine's remarkable acting. The actor, famous for powerful performances, outdoes himself here. It is as though all his triumphs over the last four decades were simply leading up to this one role.Caine is Thomas Fowler, a British journalist covering the war between French colonist rulers and Vietnam Communist rebels in 1952. His lover is a much young Vietnamese girl named Phuong [Da Hai Yen]. Enter Aiden Pyle [Brendan Fraser], a young, idealistic American who thinks he has all the right answers for solving the Vietnam `problem'. [Although Greene wrote the book in 1955, years before America got heavily involved in the Vietnam conflict, he is remarkably accurate about how this country would eventually act in the situation.] Pyle sees Phuong, and it is love at first sight. He vows not to become involved with her as long as she is with Fowler, but, of course, this vow can not hold up. Eventually, Pyle's decision to pursue Phuong leads to dire consequences for everyone involved.Australian director Philip Noyce is best known for his high profile, big budget movies such as ""Patriot Games"" and ""Clear and Present Danger"". His legacy will rest with such `small' movies as this one. ""Dead Calm"" and ""Rabbit Proof Fence"".The theme is the moral ambiguity of both love and war, and the movie, though it strays somewhat from the novel's plot, remains faithful to Greene's point of view.

It is a film that prefers to make love, not war: Love is the battlefield on which the fate of all three is decided.There is much on which the eye can concentrate in this film: the gorgeous manner in which the film is shot looks remarkably like color films shot in the fifties with saturated color, slightly faded and the beauty of Saigon and it's restaurants and women. In the middle of all this strides Caine's Fowler a man who has seen it all both on and off the battlefield yet can still extend his heart and his love to Phoung with whom he is living. Fraser's Pyle is a newcomer: he is everything that Fowler was 30 years before; young, brash, hopeful. He falls in love with Phoung as well.How all of this is resolved is done in a rather perfunctory, though proficient manner. The performances on the other hand are the highlight of this film. Michael Caine, carrying the burden of his 100+ films and the world-weariness of Fowler on his faces vibrates here with intelligence and horse sense, but also a genuine sensuality; an awareness and appreciation of his attraction for Phuong. Brendan Fraser plays Pyle in his usual stalwart manner but he is very effective nonetheless. And Do Thi Hai Yen does very well with the femme fatale role: she's beautiful and mysterious and genuine in her feelings for both men.""The Quiet American"" recalls an era long gone. One in which the world seemed united against the ""Red Horde.""

In the movie, Fowler is presented as having grown from cynicism to moral belief by becoming crusading journalist dedicated to exposing the Viet Nam war. At the end of the book, Fowler is presented as seeking redemption for his role in the murder of Pyle, and, by implication, his life in general - he desperately wants to say ""I'm sorry.""As I said, risky and refreshing.

Brendan Fraser does a solid job as Alden Pyle, a young American who falls in love with Fowler's Vietnamese girlfriend. (Mr. Fraser is excellent as the swashbuckling, romantic, funny male lead in THE MUMMY.) THE QUIET AMERICAN is a love triangle movie but it is also a political film and, unfortunately, it is at heart an anti-American film. The film basically condemns American efforts to organize native Vietnamese forces against the communists, which seems necessary since the French at the time were losing the war against the communists. I can't really say more about the political aspects of the movie without giving away the plot, except to say that the dramatic tone and emotional weight of THE QUIET AMERICAN make Americans the villians of the piece without little, if any, logical foundation. If you don't much like American proactive foreign policies, you will probably like this film a lot. If you are pro-American you may be disappointed at the bitter tone here. That aside, THE QUIET AMERICAN nevertheless is a beautifully filmed period piece with lots of authentic-feeling sets and excellent acting.

He makes the acquaintance of an American named Aldan Pyle (Brendan Fraser) who is in Vietnam with the US's Economic Aid Mission. After the London Times threatens to recall Fowler to London, his increased efforts to find newsworthy stories take him into the war's hot spots and political intrigues. Meanwhile, Mr. Pyle has fallen in love with Fowler's mistress, Phuong (Do Thi Hai Yen), and tries to lure her away. When bombs go off in the busy streets of Saigon, Fowler is faced with the realization that he may have to take a side in this war that is erupting around him.""The Quiet American"" is based on Graham Greene's novel of the same name, which Greene published in 1955 after witnessing the failure of French policy in Indochina. The novel has been adeptly adapted for the screen by Robert Schenkkan and the renowned Christopher Hampton. Thomas Fowler is one of Michael Caine's best roles in recent years. Caine makes Fowler's attachment to his mistress and his fear of losing her to the younger, more available man both touching and palpable. And he makes Fowler sympathetic, sometimes in spite of himself. It's also nice to see Brendan Fraser in a role that is not fluff.

With that said and done, here's the holes as I see it. There seems to be no real chemistry between any members of the love triangle. I didn't believe the actors weren't acting.

First of all, Michael Caine has long been a favorite actor of mine. He elevates every piece of material that he performs, and in this film, his portrayal of Thomas Fowler is nuanced by a lifetime of acting, learning, and observing human nature. Caine plays a British journalist reporting from Saigon in the early 50's. Fowler enjoys a rather lazy life, having tea at the Continental Hotel and indulging himself with a beautiful young Vietnamese mistress. Fraser, no slouch himself, especially considering that he must hold his own in plenty of scenes with Caine, plays Alden Pyle, the quiet American of the film's title.This film has haunted me over the past two days. The movie's central story is one of an older European man in love with an exotic young beauty. He suddenly finds his relationship challenged by an interloper, a clever young American who has quite a bit more to offer. For me, the primary thrust of the film dealt with what one will do to obtain, or retain, what one desires. Both men want the girl, and the film hinges on what each man is willing to do to have her. This tortured triangle is set against the growing unrest in Vietnam, and we all know how THAT conflict went.There are also many other themes at work in the film: how the girl herself represents Vietnam (locked in a struggle of possession), the way political forces worldwide are often manipulated behind closed doors, and the question of whether ends (no matter how good) justify their means (no matter how bad). Both men seem to metaphorically represent the countries they come from. Oddly, their approaches to the two different conflicts (the fight over the girl and the fight over Vietnam), seem to be polar opposites.The film is also richly shot and very atmospheric. Fowler's character is in love with Vietnam and, before you finish watching the film, I can almost guarantee that you'll have some interest in visiting it yourself. Pyle's blinding white suit, worn in the final scenes of the film, and the face of Hai Yen Do (who plays the girl in question - Fong), will be mental images you won't be able to shake.The Quiet American is riveting, well worth the investment of your time, and it will keep you thinking for a while.",5,Totally entranced,1152403200,"07 9, 2006",2006,2334,"['saw', 'Quiet', 'American', 'starring', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'weekend', 'was', 'totally', 'entranced', 'First', 'all', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'long', 'been', 'favorite', 'actor', 'mine', 'piece', 'material', 'film', 'portrayal', 'Thomas', 'Fowler', 'nuanced', 'lifetime', 'acting', 'learning', 'observing', 'human', 'nature', 'Caine', 'British', 'journalist', 'reporting', 'Saigon', 'early', '50', 'Fowler', 'rather', 'lazy', 'life', 'having', 'tea', 'Continental', 'Hotel', 'indulging', 'beautiful', 'young', 'Vietnamese', 'mistress', 'Fraser', 'slouch', 'especially', 'considering', 'must', 'hold', 'own', 'plenty', 'scenes', 'Caine', 'Alden', 'Pyle', 'quiet', 'American', 'film', 'title.This', 'film', 'haunted', 'past', 'two', 'days', 'movie', 'central', 'story', 'one', 'older', 'European', 'man', 'love', 'exotic', 'young', 'beauty', 'suddenly', 'relationship', 'challenged', 'interloper', 'clever', 'young', 'American', 'who', 'quite', 'bit', 'more', 'offer', 'primary', 'thrust', 'film', 'dealt', 'what', 'one', 'will', 'do', 'obtain', 'retain', 'what', 'one', 'men', 'want', 'girl', 'film', 'hinges', 'what', 'man', 'willing', 'do', 'have', 'tortured', 'triangle', 'set', 'growing', 'unrest', 'Vietnam', 'know', 'how', 'conflict', 'are', 'also', 'many', 'other', 'themes', 'work', 'film', 'how', 'girl', 'Vietnam', 'locked', 'struggle', 'possession', 'way', 'political', 'forces', 'are', 'often', 'manipulated', 'closed', 'doors', 'question', 'ends', 'matter', 'how', 'good', 'justify', 'means', 'matter', 'how', 'bad', 'men', 'seem', 'metaphorically', 'represent', 'countries', 'come', 'Oddly', 'approaches', 'two', 'different', 'conflicts', 'fight', 'girl', 'fight', 'Vietnam', 'seem', 'be', 'polar', 'opposites.The', 'film', 'also', 'richly', 'shot', 'very', 'atmospheric', 'Fowler', 'character', 'love', 'Vietnam', 'finish', 'watching', 'film', 'can', 'almost', 'guarantee', ""'ll"", 'have', 'interest', 'visiting', 'Pyle', 'blinding', 'white', 'suit', 'worn', 'final', 'scenes', 'film', 'face', 'Hai', 'Yen', 'Do', 'who', 'girl', 'question', 'Fong', 'will', 'be', 'mental', 'images', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'shake.The', 'Quiet', 'American', 'riveting', 'well', 'investment', 'time', 'will', 'keep', 'thinking', 'while']",N/A

It is well-acted and takes place in a place and time of interest to Americans; Viet Nam on the eve of Dien Bien Phu.  The story begins with the death of a young American and we backtrack from there.  The main character is a British journalist who has spent some years in Saigon on assignment.  With the help of his local assistant, he has carved out a comfortable niche for himself.  He has a beautiful young mistress and enough connections with enough sources that he can pretty much call in his by-line as needed.  Things start to take a turn when he meets a young American who is there on a mission of medical service in the country.  As political events unfold in the volatil situation, the stakes start to get higher and our young American starts to look more CIA than AMA.  There is a problem developing between the journalist and the young American after the latter declares his love for the former's mistress.  Many different twists and turns ensue as the story reaches a climax in the death of the young American.The story is well-told and directed: we are often mistified but never lost.  As we shift from the personal to the impersonal, we realize that all characters are flawed and out for their own best interests.  The murder taints many hands.  I was reminded of &quot;The Rules of the Game&quot; in the attitude of the powers that be towards the murder of the young American.  Must be something French about it.Michael Caine's Best Actor nomination was certainly deserved in his role as the jouralist.  Directing could have been another nomination but that was a tough category this year.

Then everything goes wacko and you find out you've been had!The movie is symbolic, see. The movie is set in Nam in 1952, yes, not 1963, but '52. We have the evil effete French colonialists, but rather than fight for their colony, they would rather sip Poilly Fiussee in waterfront bistros and imagine that the rockets in the distance are fireworks. We have Phuong, or ""phoenix"". She represents Vietnam, itself, virginal and mysterious, forced to lie down with the enemy.  She's the 20 something girlfriend of 60 year old Michael Caine, representing evil corrupt Europe, being as he is old and European. They fool around while smoking opium (the Opiate of the People, no doubt).We have the unseen Communists, but those commies are just freedom fighters fighting to remove the yoke of Imperialism from the People. They never do anything wrong.So who is the villian? Why it's the Quiet American, of course! In love with Pheonix, by day he masquerades as a Red Cross doctor making eyeglasses for poor Vietnamese, but at night he uses the plastic he makes eyeglasses with to make plastique explosives and blow up innocent women and children. He puts a puppet Vietnamese colonel in charge and goes after the innocent Commies and other noncombatants.You see, it's all symbolic!At the end of the movie you find out that it was filmed on location in Vietnam with much help and assistance of the Vietcong government. The Cold War word ""comsymp"" used to be used before the fall of the Soviet Union, but not much now. It means ""sympathetic to communism"". At the end, the movie turns out to be government sponsored, self-justifying communist propaganda. More credulous American viewers just shake their heads in agreement with it's whitewash. Just ask the millions of Vietnamese who moved to America after the war how benign the VC were.

608064,A3S75QQLGAOOAO,B00005JLXB,Rick Darby,"[6, 13]","Michael Caine is the film's principal asset. As Fowler, an uncelebrated journalist barely hanging on in the waning days of French rule in 1950s Vietnam (nee Indochina), he adds another memorable portrait to his gallery of characters.Fowler is a man who is pretty much washed up and knows it, a sensitive hack and self-protective cynic whose heart has a single lifeline: his love for Phuong, the young Asian woman whom he cannot marry because his wife back in England won't divorce him.Caine shows us the man's misery, his tarnished nobility, and his struggle to be invulnerable when Phuong appears to be won over by Pyle, a young, idealistic American (he of the title), who seems to have so much of what Fowler lacks -- including the ability to give Phuong a secure future. Fowler's existential struggle between despair and absurd hope is depicted by Caine precisely and movingly.Otherwise, the film isn't up to much. I haven't read the Graham Greene novel on which it was based, but the script, although it gives Caine enough to work with, loses focus when it wanders away from his character. Director Philip Noyce tries, and sometimes succeeds, in supplying visual poetry, but too much of the film consists of standard oriental-decadence images (opium dens, flashy nightclubs, a tired-eyed and stubble-chinned French police inspector in a white suit), off-the-shelf action scenes and hackneyed political intrigue.It's also a come-beat-the-stuffing-out-of-wicked-America festival. The CIA office is inhabited by robot-like schemers in identical white shirts;  Pyle, the ""quiet American"" (so unlike those other Yankee buffoons), is not what he seems, either.  I could be wrong, but I think that Greene (unlike John le Carre) never declined into this kind of sophomoric caricature.Caine's portrayal of a willing fool for love is in a more rarified class than the rest of the movie.",3,A willing fool,1095984000,"09 24, 2004",2004,1880,"['Michael', 'Caine', 'film', 'principal', 'asset', 'Fowler', 'uncelebrated', 'journalist', 'barely', 'hanging', 'waning', 'days', 'French', 'rule', '1950s', 'Vietnam', 'nee', 'Indochina', 'memorable', 'portrait', 'gallery', 'characters.Fowler', 'man', 'who', 'pretty', 'much', 'washed', 'up', 'sensitive', 'hack', 'self-protective', 'cynic', 'heart', 'single', 'lifeline', 'love', 'Phuong', 'young', 'Asian', 'woman', 'whom', 'can', 'not', 'marry', 'wife', 'back', 'England', 'wo', ""n't"", 'divorce', 'him.Caine', 'shows', 'man', 'misery', 'tarnished', 'nobility', 'struggle', 'be', 'invulnerable', 'when', 'Phuong', 'be', 'won', 'Pyle', 'young', 'idealistic', 'American', 'title', 'who', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'what', 'Fowler', 'including', 'ability', 'give', 'Phuong', 'secure', 'future', 'Fowler', 'existential', 'struggle', 'despair', 'absurd', 'hope', 'depicted', 'Caine', 'precisely', 'movingly.Otherwise', 'film', ""n't"", 'up', 'much', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'novel', 'was', 'based', 'script', 'Caine', 'enough', 'work', 'loses', 'focus', 'when', 'away', 'character', 'Director', 'Philip', 'Noyce', 'tries', 'sometimes', 'supplying', 'visual', 'poetry', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'standard', 'oriental-decadence', 'images', 'opium', 'dens', 'flashy', 'nightclubs', 'tired-eyed', 'stubble-chinned', 'French', 'police', 'inspector', 'white', 'suit', 'off-the-shelf', 'action', 'scenes', 'hackneyed', 'political', 'intrigue.It', 'also', 'come-beat-the-stuffing-out-of-wicked-America', 'festival', 'CIA', 'office', 'inhabited', 'robot-like', 'schemers', 'identical', 'white', 'shirts', 'Pyle', 'quiet', 'American', 'other', 'Yankee', 'buffoons', 'not', 'what', 'either', 'could', 'be', 'wrong', 'think', 'Greene', 'John', 'le', 'Carre', 'never', 'declined', 'kind', 'sophomoric', 'caricature.Caine', 'portrayal', 'willing', 'fool', 'love', 'more', 'rarified', 'class', 'rest', 'movie']",N/A

Another hallmark of a Noyce thriller is that it's deadly slow to start, one of the reasons why the opening fifteen minutes of Rabbit-Proof Fence were such a shock to the system; here, again, Noyce goes back to the slow and steady approach. We spend most of the first half of the film getting to know the three principals and the characters who surround them (Holmes Osborne [Donnie Darko, Identity], as Granger, is a wonderful character who should've gotten more screen time, especially) before the action kicks in. The central subplot of the film revolves around the rise to power of General The (Quang Hai, another newcomer), formerly of the Vietnamese Army, who has broken with the communists and set up his own militia, opposing both the French colonialists and the communists trying to overthrow them. Most of the film's action comes from Fowler trying to figure out who General The actually is, and who's behind his rise to power.A good film, and Caine's performance was easily deserving of his Best Actor nomination.

608067,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00005JLXB,Robert Moore,"[42, 45]","Michael Caine has managed a large number of superb performances over the years, but this is probably his finest film in many, many years.  Although Brendan Fraser and the remarkably beautiful Do Thi Hai Yen are excellent in the other two main roles, this film lives or dies with the character of Thomas Fowler.  Thankfully, Caine is stunning.  His performance is quiet, nuanced, and remarkably subtle.  It is paradoxically one of the most emotional performances he has given in some time, but at the same time one of his more subdued.The film is set in Vietnam during the French war with the Communists of North Vietnam.  It is also the time when the United States began their involvement in the country, doing their part to stymie the spread of the Red Menace.  The movie does a great job of presenting the emerging complexities of the conflict.  There are several stunning scenes, in particular a terrorist bombing, which is one of the most vivid and horrifying instances of onscreen violence that I have witnessed in some time.  But the focus of the film always remains on the interplay of the personalities.  The politics of the situation is not ignored, but in the end the film is about people.Director Philip Noyce had before 2002 been known primarily as a director of Hollywood action films, but after directing two of the finest films of this past year in THE RABBIT-PROOF FENCE and THE QUIET AMERICAN, he has suddenly emerged as one of the finer directors of serious films.  I don't know what his next project is going to be, but I await it with great eagerness.  He keeps both the mood and the lighting of this film very, very dark.  Most of the scenes take place in shadows, in the evening, or in darkened rooms, as if it were an external manifestation of the internal ambiguity that permeates the film.I have long wanted to see Brendan Fraser take on more serious roles, especially after seeing him in GODS AND MONSTERS.  He is good in comedy, but I have sometimes found the congenial idiots he so often portrays to be a little irritating.This is a wonderfully serious film, and it stands in stark contrast to so many of the films coming out these days.

608068,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,B00005JLXB,Robert Morris,"[3, 4]","Actually, much of this film is quiet. Set in Vietnam in 1952, it  stars Michael Caine as journalist Thomas Fowler who has become quite comfortable, filing occasional articles on the war with The Times in London. Sharing sex and drugs with his young and lovely paramour Phuong (Do Hai Yen), Fowler has no interest in returning home to his wife nor in divorcing her. Then he becomes friends with an American medical missionary, Alden Pyle (Brendan Fraser), and Fowler's lifestyle becomes unexpectedly complicated. Caine received and deserved nomination for Best Actor in a lead role. The cinematography (Christopher Doyle) is first-rate. Credit Rade Serbedzija with a fine performance as Inspector Vigot.However, Phillip Noyce's direction and the screenplay adaptation (by Christopher Hampton and Robert Schenkkan) of Graham Greene's novel are much less effective than I had expected. The key to understanding Greene's Fowler is to appreciate the extent to which he is torn between various loyalties, passions, fears, and ambitions. He feels compelled to defend his carefully constructed status quo even as his conscience refuses to remain silent. Caine has sufficient talent to suggest nuances of Fowler's character and personality which Noyce -- for whatever reasons -- did not deem necessary. As for Pyle, he symbolizes so much that Greene deplored in United States foreign policies regarding Indo China in general, and Vietnam in particular. Under Noyce's direction, Fraser only begins to suggest the menace his character represents in the novel. Had he done so, this film would have had much greater dramatic impact. Noyce also fails to establish and then intensify significant conflicts of values in the relationship between Fowler and Pyle. Moreover, he under-utilizes Phoung whose function in the movie seems limited almost entirely to being a human ""toy"" whom both Fowler and Pyle wish to possess.What does work so well in this film suggests what it might have been. That is why I was especially interested in the DVD special features which include a ""Commentary"" by director Phillip Noyce, actors Michael Caine, Brendan Fraser, Tzi Ma, producers Sydney Pollack, Staffan Ahrenberg, William Hoberg, co-writer Christopher Hampton, and interpreter/advisor to the director, Tran An Hua; an ""Anatomy of a Scene"" Sundance Channel show; an original featurette; a Vietnam timeline; a DVD-ROM study guide; and original book reviews.",4,"In Certain Respects, Too Quiet",1079222400,"03 14, 2004",2004,2430,"['Actually', 'much', 'film', 'quiet', 'Set', 'Vietnam', '1952', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'journalist', 'Thomas', 'Fowler', 'who', 'become', 'quite', 'comfortable', 'filing', 'occasional', 'articles', 'war', 'Times', 'London', 'Sharing', 'sex', 'drugs', 'young', 'lovely', 'paramour', 'Phuong', 'Do', 'Hai', 'Yen', 'Fowler', 'interest', 'returning', 'home', 'wife', 'divorcing', 'Then', 'friends', 'American', 'medical', 'missionary', 'Alden', 'Pyle', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'Fowler', 'lifestyle', 'becomes', 'unexpectedly', 'complicated', 'Caine', 'received', 'deserved', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Actor', 'lead', 'role', 'cinematography', 'Christopher', 'Doyle', 'first-rate', 'Credit', 'Rade', 'Serbedzija', 'fine', 'performance', 'Inspector', 'Vigot.However', 'Phillip', 'Noyce', 'direction', 'screenplay', 'adaptation', 'Christopher', 'Hampton', 'Robert', 'Schenkkan', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'novel', 'are', 'much', 'less', 'effective', 'had', 'expected', 'key', 'understanding', 'Greene', 'Fowler', 'appreciate', 'extent', 'torn', 'various', 'loyalties', 'passions', 'fears', 'ambitions', 'compelled', 'defend', 'carefully', 'constructed', 'status', 'quo', 'even', 'conscience', 'remain', 'silent', 'Caine', 'sufficient', 'talent', 'suggest', 'nuances', 'Fowler', 'character', 'personality', 'Noyce', 'reasons', 'did', 'not', 'deem', 'necessary', 'Pyle', 'so', 'much', 'Greene', 'deplored', 'United', 'States', 'foreign', 'policies', 'regarding', 'Indo', 'China', 'general', 'Vietnam', 'particular', 'Noyce', 'direction', 'Fraser', 'only', 'suggest', 'menace', 'character', 'novel', 'Had', 'done', 'so', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'much', 'greater', 'dramatic', 'impact', 'Noyce', 'also', 'establish', 'then', 'intensify', 'significant', 'conflicts', 'values', 'relationship', 'Fowler', 'Pyle', 'Moreover', 'under-utilizes', 'Phoung', 'function', 'movie', 'limited', 'almost', 'entirely', 'being', 'human', 'toy', 'whom', 'Fowler', 'Pyle', 'wish', 'possess.What', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'film', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'why', 'was', 'especially', 'interested', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'Commentary', 'director', 'Phillip', 'Noyce', 'actors', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'Tzi', 'Ma', 'producers', 'Sydney', 'Pollack', 'Staffan', 'Ahrenberg', 'William', 'Hoberg', 'co-writer', 'Christopher', 'Hampton', 'interpreter/advisor', 'director', 'Tran', 'Hua', 'Anatomy', 'Scene', 'Sundance', 'Channel', 'show', 'original', 'featurette', 'Vietnam', 'timeline', 'DVD-ROM', 'study', 'guide', 'original', 'book', 'reviews']",N/A

My take is that it is an interesting supplement to the book. I just suggest seeing it after reading the book, not before.The screenplayers made some rearrangements, merged a couple of characters into one, cut some scenes and added a few details. In the end, it is very loyal to the book. These changes were mostly for the movie not to be too long.I remember when Michael Caine went to Charlie Rose and said that he considered his work in this movie to be his best ever. He said that he could not do better than that. I see his point. He indeed brought Fowler to life. I was surprised that the screenplayers kept Fowler's line when he told Pyle to meet him at his place in the case he was not in the restaurant. Only those that read the book could have grasped that. It would have been asking too much from Michael Caine to make those that haven't read the book understand the meaning of that line.Brendan Fraser was more than serviceable. It was interesting to see Pyle in flesh and bone.Do Thi Hai Yen was a wonderful and seductive Phuong.This movie is not in the same league as ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier Spy"".

Zwick,"[1, 2]","Michael Caine gives yet another outstanding performance in ""The Quiet American,"" Philip Noyce's 2002 adaptation of the Graham Greene Cold War novel (the first movie version was released in 1958).  Set in 1952 Saigon, the film features Caine as Thomas Fowler, a world-weary British journalist who's been sent to Vietnam to cover the attempt by colonial French forces to hold back the communist insurgence from the North.  But Fowler has a problem.  Despite the fact that he is a reporter, he freely admits that this country exerts a sort of magical hold on him and that, in order to maintain that image, he must will himself to look beyond the ugliness and strife that are tearing the country apart.  In fact, reporting is the last thing on Fowler's mind.  He is even madly in love with a beautiful young Vietnamese girl who lives with him.  When his publishers back in England threaten to call him back, Fowler realizes that he must become more actively engaged in the events around him if he hopes to be allowed to stay.One day he meets Alden Pyle (Brendan Fraser), an American eye specialist who falls in love with Fowler's girl.  Even though they are drawn together by much that they have in common, Fowler and Pyle soon become rivals for the woman, though by the end, their conflict has broadened to include the issues of war vs. peace, truth vs. deception, and personal feelings vs. political expediency.""The Quiet American"" is typical Greene in that it provides an intense personal drama played against the backdrop of geopolitical turmoil in an exotic setting.  Both Caine and Fraser bring a quiet intensity to their scenes together.  Caine, in particular, is brilliant at conveying the many moods of a man who wants to be left alone to live a simple life with the woman he loves but who knows that circumstances are conspiring to make such a life impossible.  He is heartbreaking as he sees that ideal existence suddenly slipping away, with little he can do to stop it from happening.  He also begins to see just how difficult it is to remain emotionally detached from the horrors happening around him once the atrocities begin to encroach on his world directly.  Fowler also has to decide whether his final action is truly rooted in a humanitarian impulse or the product of wanting to eliminate a pesky rival from the field of competition.In addition to telling a fairly solid story, ""The Quiet American"" also provides a glimpse into the history of its region, particularly showing how the Americans ended up usurping the role of the French in that far off, alien country in the late `50's and early `60's.  This is reflected in a wonderful coda that chronicles the steps leading up to this slow handoff of power and responsibility.But for all the film's various virtues, it is Caine's performance that is the real reason to catch ""The Quiet American.""",3,Caine scores again,1060473600,"08 10, 2003",2003,2861,"['Michael', 'Caine', 'yet', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'Quiet', 'American', 'Philip', 'Noyce', '2002', 'adaptation', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'Cold', 'War', 'novel', 'first', 'movie', 'version', 'was', 'released', '1958', 'Set', '1952', 'Saigon', 'film', 'Caine', 'Thomas', 'Fowler', 'world-weary', 'British', 'journalist', 'who', 'been', 'sent', 'Vietnam', 'cover', 'attempt', 'colonial', 'French', 'forces', 'hold', 'back', 'communist', 'insurgence', 'North', 'Fowler', 'problem', 'fact', 'reporter', 'freely', 'country', 'sort', 'magical', 'hold', 'order', 'maintain', 'image', 'must', 'will', 'look', 'ugliness', 'strife', 'are', 'tearing', 'country', 'apart', 'fact', 'reporting', 'last', 'thing', 'Fowler', 'mind', 'even', 'madly', 'love', 'beautiful', 'young', 'Vietnamese', 'girl', 'who', 'When', 'publishers', 'back', 'England', 'threaten', 'call', 'back', 'Fowler', 'must', 'become', 'more', 'actively', 'engaged', 'events', 'be', 'allowed', 'stay.One', 'day', 'Alden', 'Pyle', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'American', 'eye', 'specialist', 'who', 'love', 'Fowler', 'girl', 'Even', 'are', 'drawn', 'together', 'much', 'have', 'common', 'Fowler', 'Pyle', 'soon', 'become', 'rivals', 'woman', 'end', 'conflict', 'broadened', 'include', 'issues', 'war', 'vs.', 'peace', 'truth', 'vs.', 'deception', 'personal', 'feelings', 'vs.', 'political', 'expediency', 'Quiet', 'American', 'typical', 'Greene', 'intense', 'personal', 'drama', 'played', 'backdrop', 'geopolitical', 'turmoil', 'exotic', 'setting', 'Caine', 'Fraser', 'bring', 'quiet', 'intensity', 'scenes', 'together', 'Caine', 'particular', 'brilliant', 'conveying', 'many', 'moods', 'man', 'who', 'be', 'left', 'alone', 'live', 'simple', 'life', 'woman', 'who', 'circumstances', 'are', 'conspiring', 'make', 'life', 'impossible', 'heartbreaking', 'ideal', 'existence', 'suddenly', 'slipping', 'away', 'little', 'can', 'do', 'stop', 'happening', 'also', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'difficult', 'remain', 'emotionally', 'detached', 'horrors', 'happening', 'once', 'atrocities', 'begin', 'encroach', 'world', 'directly', 'Fowler', 'also', 'decide', 'final', 'action', 'truly', 'rooted', 'humanitarian', 'impulse', 'product', 'wanting', 'eliminate', 'pesky', 'rival', 'field', 'competition.In', 'addition', 'telling', 'fairly', 'solid', 'story', 'Quiet', 'American', 'also', 'glimpse', 'history', 'region', 'particularly', 'showing', 'how', 'Americans', 'ended', 'up', 'usurping', 'role', 'French', 'far', 'off', 'alien', 'country', 'late', '50', 'early', '60', 'reflected', 'wonderful', 'coda', 'steps', 'leading', 'up', 'slow', 'handoff', 'power', 'responsibility.But', 'film', 'various', 'virtues', 'Caine', 'performance', 'real', 'reason', 'catch', 'Quiet', 'American']",N/A

And then there're the memorable quotes: &quot;There is nothing quiet in the heart that desires a love as unforgettable as a mistress&quot;Caine, needless to mention, is suave and near-perfect as usual.

The script is beautifully written and acted, and the fact that we as the audience know what eventually happens in vietnam adds to the overall affect of the film (based on the book by Graham Greene, actually written before the war). The first movie of the book was a watchable but bastardised version - making it a pro-US anti communist film that the book certainly wasn't intended to be (apparently the author wasn't too happy with the propaganda driven outcome - although I'm sure he was financially rewarded for it). It's sad to see that some of the American reviewers have taken umbridge at the film's anti US sentiments (well itis about Vietnam for crying out loud) which is nothing more than nationalistic nonsense (the film also criticises British and French colonialism but you don't see reviewers from those nations crying about it.

Here is Thomas Fowler (Michael Caine), a middle-aged foreign correspondent for ""The Times"", whose life is really not too bad at all. He has successfully escaped the greyness of London and a miserable marriage for an easy, well-paid job in an adopted country he loves and the charms of his preposterously young and beautiful mistress, Phuong (Do Thi Hai Yan). But all is not altogether well. For one thing, somewhat ironically with hindsight, his employers are having doubts as to whether Vietnam is a significant enough place to justify the expense of maintaining a correspondent there. And then there is Pyle (Brendan Fraser), a young, idealistic rather Brahminical Bostonian self-styled eye-doctor who has shown up and is making no secret whatever of his romantic interest in Phuong. Desperate to avoid return to London, Fowler starts to redouble his efforts to look into political developments, notably the sinister new ""Third Force"" represented by the unattractive General The who is not the French colonial power and not the Communists but whose contempt for human life leaves little to recommend him and whom our idealistic young eye-doctor seems to know...This is a brilliant film. It's easily the best movie to be based on a Graham Greene novel since ""Brighton Rock"" and conveys to absolute perfection the anxieties and moral ambivalence of the world that very great writer imagined for us. It's absorbing, exciting and (not a word you can seriously apply to many current American movies this) deep. The central performances by Caine and Fraser are altogether superb.It's not, however the cast I was most struck by. It must have struck others with the same depression as it did me that the director of entertaining  but undistinguished action movies like ""Patriot Games and ""Clear and Present Danger"" not to mention utter garbage like ""Sliver"" and ""The Saint"" was once up to making movies as good as ""Newsfront"".  Ah well, we may have thought, it's not the first time someone has started out making really fine intelligent movies only to lose it and end up making pap.

608076,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B00005JLXB,Stephanie De Pue,"[4, 4]","""The Quiet American,"" (2002), a romantic war/political drama, is the second treatment to be made of the book of the same name,The Quiet American, by the great British master of the spy story, and several other genres, Graham Greene.  An earlier, American treatment of the same name, starring Audie Murphy, attempted to leach out its undoubted anti-Americanism.  This treatment, by British director Philip Noyce, (Patriot Games), leaves the strong anti-Americanism in.  So much so that, although Miramax had paid $5.5 million for the rights to distribute the movie in North America and some other territories, they shelved it for more than a year after the attacks of 9/11/01, and planned to send it straight to video.  But the hugely talented starring actor Michael Caine,(Alfie,The Man Who Would Be King), who was to be Oscar nominated for his part here, persuaded Miramax to screen it at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival. It then received many good reviews, so Miramax decided to chance a theatrical release of it in the United States.At its heart, this murder mystery centers on a love triangle set against the French Indochina War in 1952 Vietnam.  It's set in, and was filmed in, Saigon, then in the midst of the debilitating Vietnamese war of liberation against its French colonial masters.  Soon to be followed by the overwhelmingly destructive Vietnamese struggle against American forces.  The city was, then as now, a beautiful, exotic, mysterious place, suffused with opium, intrigue and betrayal.  Caine, playing British reporter Thomas Fowler, correspondent for the London Times, loves his young Vietnamese mistress Phuong, but cannot get a divorce from his unseen British wife.  He is dismayed when a recently arrived idealistic young American aid worker, graduate of an Ivy League University, Alden Pyle (played by Canadian born Brendan Fraser,Blast from the Past), with whom he becomes friendly, also begins to vie for her attention.  The tempestuous love triangle that results leads to a series of startling revelations, and, ultimately, murder.  Rade Serbedzija, who played a singing Emile de Becque in a 2002 television treatment ofRodgers & Hammerstein's South Pacific, is on hand as Inspector Vigot, given the thankless task of trying to figure it all out.Nothing, and no one, is as it seems, in this adaptation of Graham Greene's classic powerful and prophetic story of love, betrayal, murder and the origin of the American war in Vietnam. Greene was one of the more influential and illustrious British writers of the 20th century.  He enjoyed a very long life, most of the 20th century, and a very long, prolific writing career, during which he gave usThe Comedians,Our Man in Havana, andThe Third Manamong many other masterworks, most of which were made into notable films.Greene himself had first-hand spy experience, having served in the African nation of Sierra Leone during World War II.  He'd been recruited to Britain's World War II Secret Service, MI6, upon the recommendation of later notorious spy/counterspy Kim Philby, a friend from Oxford days, who did the British Secret Service a great deal of damage.  However, Greene was later to say that, if ever he had to choose between his country and his friends, he hoped he'd choose his friends.The writer was instinctively anti-American, and left-wing.  He traveled widely, as a journalist, and to research his novels, and had great serendipity in his wanderings.  Many of them occurred at critical times.  The Cuban-set OUR MAN made into a film,Our Man in Havana, starring Alec Guinness, was published in October, 1956.  On New Years Day 1959 the revolutionary Castro came down from the Cuban mountains to sweep into power. THE COMEDIANS, made into a film of the same name, The Comedians [DVD], starring Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, was set in the last days of ""Papa Doc"" Duvalier's tyrannical Haiti regime.  THE QUIET AMERICAN is set just before the important battle of Dien Bien Phu, which pulled America into the war happening a world away. It's a film well-worth watching, no matter your politics, not least for a chance to feast your eyes on Saigon.",5,"Set in Saigon, a Beautiful, Exotic and Mysterious City",1341964800,"07 11, 2012",2012,4155,"['Quiet', 'American', '2002', 'romantic', 'war/political', 'drama', 'second', 'treatment', 'be', 'made', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'Quiet', 'American', 'great', 'British', 'master', 'spy', 'story', 'several', 'other', 'genres', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'earlier', 'American', 'treatment', 'same', 'name', 'starring', 'Audie', 'Murphy', 'attempted', 'leach', 'out', 'undoubted', 'anti-Americanism', 'treatment', 'British', 'director', 'Philip', 'Noyce', 'Patriot', 'Games', 'strong', 'anti-Americanism', 'So', 'much', 'Miramax', 'had', 'paid', '5.5', 'million', 'rights', 'distribute', 'movie', 'North', 'America', 'other', 'territories', 'shelved', 'more', 'year', 'attacks', '9/11/01', 'planned', 'send', 'straight', 'video', 'hugely', 'talented', 'starring', 'actor', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Alfie', 'Man', 'Who', 'Would', 'Be', 'King', 'who', 'was', 'be', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'part', 'here', 'persuaded', 'Miramax', 'screen', '2002', 'Toronto', 'International', 'Film', 'Festival', 'then', 'received', 'many', 'good', 'reviews', 'Miramax', 'decided', 'chance', 'theatrical', 'release', 'United', 'States.At', 'heart', 'murder', 'mystery', 'centers', 'love', 'triangle', 'set', 'French', 'Indochina', 'War', '1952', 'Vietnam', 'set', 'was', 'filmed', 'Saigon', 'then', 'midst', 'debilitating', 'Vietnamese', 'war', 'liberation', 'French', 'colonial', 'masters', 'Soon', 'be', 'followed', 'overwhelmingly', 'destructive', 'Vietnamese', 'struggle', 'American', 'forces', 'city', 'was', 'then', 'now', 'beautiful', 'exotic', 'mysterious', 'place', 'suffused', 'opium', 'intrigue', 'betrayal', 'Caine', 'playing', 'British', 'reporter', 'Thomas', 'Fowler', 'correspondent', 'London', 'Times', 'young', 'Vietnamese', 'mistress', 'Phuong', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'divorce', 'unseen', 'British', 'wife', 'dismayed', 'when', 'recently', 'arrived', 'idealistic', 'young', 'American', 'aid', 'worker', 'graduate', 'Ivy', 'League', 'University', 'Alden', 'Pyle', 'played', 'Canadian', 'born', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'Blast', 'Past', 'whom', 'friendly', 'also', 'vie', 'attention', 'tempestuous', 'love', 'triangle', 'results', 'series', 'startling', 'revelations', 'ultimately', 'murder', 'Rade', 'Serbedzija', 'who', 'played', 'singing', 'Emile', 'de', 'Becque', '2002', 'television', 'treatment', 'ofRodgers', 'Hammerstein', 'South', 'Pacific', 'hand', 'Inspector', 'Vigot', 'given', 'thankless', 'task', 'trying', 'figure', 'out.Nothing', 'one', 'adaptation', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'classic', 'powerful', 'prophetic', 'story', 'love', 'betrayal', 'murder', 'origin', 'American', 'war', 'Vietnam', 'Greene', 'was', 'one', 'more', 'influential', 'illustrious', 'British', 'writers', '20th', 'century', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'long', 'life', 'most', '20th', 'century', 'very', 'long', 'prolific', 'writing', 'career', 'gave', 'usThe', 'Comedians', 'Man', 'Havana', 'andThe', 'Third', 'Manamong', 'many', 'other', 'masterworks', 'most', 'were', 'made', 'notable', 'films.Greene', 'had', 'first-hand', 'spy', 'experience', 'having', 'served', 'African', 'nation', 'Sierra', 'Leone', 'World', 'War', 'II', ""'d"", 'been', 'recruited', 'Britain', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Secret', 'Service', 'MI6', 'recommendation', 'later', 'notorious', 'spy/counterspy', 'Kim', 'Philby', 'friend', 'Oxford', 'days', 'who', 'did', 'British', 'Secret', 'Service', 'great', 'deal', 'damage', 'However', 'Greene', 'was', 'later', 'say', 'ever', 'had', 'choose', 'country', 'friends', 'hoped', ""'d"", 'choose', 'friends.The', 'writer', 'was', 'instinctively', 'anti-American', 'left-wing', 'traveled', 'widely', 'journalist', 'research', 'novels', 'had', 'great', 'serendipity', 'wanderings', 'Many', 'occurred', 'critical', 'times', 'Cuban-set', 'OUR', 'MAN', 'made', 'film', 'Man', 'Havana', 'starring', 'Alec', 'Guinness', 'was', 'published', 'October', '1956', 'New', 'Years', 'Day', '1959', 'revolutionary', 'Castro', 'came', 'down', 'Cuban', 'mountains', 'sweep', 'power', 'COMEDIANS', 'made', 'film', 'same', 'name', 'Comedians', '[', 'DVD', ']', 'starring', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'was', 'set', 'last', 'days', 'Papa', 'Doc', 'Duvalier', 'tyrannical', 'Haiti', 'regime', 'QUIET', 'AMERICAN', 'set', 'just', 'important', 'battle', 'Dien', 'Bien', 'Phu', 'pulled', 'America', 'war', 'happening', 'world', 'away', 'film', 'well-worth', 'watching', 'matter', 'politics', 'not', 'least', 'chance', 'feast', 'eyes', 'Saigon']",N/A
608077,AJDYDG7YZY9QL,B00005JLXB,Stephen A. Haines,"[26, 32]","Crackling with tension from the opening scenes, this is an outstanding film.  Noyce's team responds brilliantly to his direction in this tight drama about pre-American Viet Nam.  The film captures the nature of the changing struggle as the almost invisible Viet Minh probe Saigon's defenses.  The French, clearly floundering, are minimally represented.  The war, the politics, the corruption are merely background to this story of desperate love.  Yet all those subdued elements intrude on the three protagonists who must react to them.  Love and war are a common theme in many films, but are brought together in this one with uncommon sensitivity.  The Viet Nam conflict nearly tore America apart in later years.  The time for this film is long past, but the way Noyce has adapted Greene's novel makes it enduring and pertinent today.Michael Caine, as the indifferent British journalist, provides his paramount performance.  A superb actor in all his roles, with this one he assumes status among the very best.  Given the power of his presence in this film, it might be expected that Brendan Fraser be overshadowed.  Yet this rather bumbling character from The Mummy assumes a more confident stance.  As the American intruder on both Caine's own love affair and the struggle to restrain the Communist forces, he fulfills the role with unexpected polish.  Do Thi Hai Yen, the woman caught up in both the political and personal conflicts, applies a tender counterpoint to the many levels of strife displayed elsewhere in the film.  Noyce's use of close-up in many scenes heightens feeling while keeping the characters as the film's focus.Greene's novel demonstrated how Viet Nam might become a morass of misdirected action.  It was, he predicted, not a place for the clumsy.  Fraser's role illuminates how prescient Greene was in the book.  The withholding of this film by the studio was an error.  Noyce's direction is flawless as he portrays the languid journalist becoming alert as he senses Fraser's presence is more than circumstantial.  His boldly asserted simple-minded faith in America's ability to solve geopolitical issues by brute-force presence is a message that should have been heeded when the book was published.  Hopefully, this film will again confront viewers with that clear message.

Everything works here: it's carefully written, exquisitely shot, and perfectly accompanied by Craig Armstrong's score - alternately haunting and stirring, it deftly captures both the beauty and lingering unease of the situation. The casting is spot-on: Do Thi Hai Yen does wonders with minimal dialogue, Caine puts in another superbly understated performance, and the dazzlingly versatile Brendan Fraser proves that ""Gods & Monsters"" was no fluke. The thoughtful epilogue of news headline is remarkably affecting, right down to its final image. The only thing which slightly grates are some ham-fisted moments when the mysterious power behind ""the third force"" is rather obviously revealed, e.g. Joe Tunney sticking his head into frame just after Fowler's meeting with General The. It's as if this aspect of the story is being over-explained for the mall crowd, even though the otherwise subtle writing and performances make it perfectly clear what's going on. The audience doesn't need to be told: like Fowler, we can work it out. Still, this movie was tested extensively with American preview audiences, so I assume the explanatory moments proved necessary. (Do some people have difficulty understanding a story in which the Americans aren't unambiguously the good guys?) Completed in 2001, it's a shame that this film had to sit around waiting for tempers to cool after September 11.

We are told in the opening scenes that the smell of Saigon promises everything in exchange for your soul, and essentially the movie comes down to analysing the concept of humanity: Do humans really posses it?  Yet much like the triangle that binds the relationships of the three central characters, the simple answer appears to be that one always wants what the other can't have.  It is the subterfuge that makes the film compelling as we journey with Fowler in his discovery of the truth about the involvement of America in the actions of independent `freedom fighters.'  Yet once again his motives aren't as sacrificial as they appear, for he doesn't want to loose his position and his mistress so must urgently find a big story in order to justify remaining.This is the second film version of Graham Greene's 1952 novel, and the political intentions of the original seem to have been subverted in the light of recent events.  There appears to be an attempt to question the morality of the western superpowers today through comparisons to the past.  In a summation at the end we are told of the lives lost in the Vietnam war and when American involvement moved from the shadows to the foreground eventually 495,000 American troops died in conflict.  While this is undoubtedly poignant, it is the films undoing and ultimate weakness.  Rather than engage the text where it works as a film of three lives and two stories that cross over and become entangled, there are attempts to parallel today either directly as mentioned before or unfortunately indirectly through the viewers own mind due to the timing of its release.  Indeed, many believe that this is the cause of its scaled down opening in the States.However uneasily this film sits, it is beautifully shot by Chris Doyle, the genius behind many of the ionic Wong Kar Wai films, and the performances of the cast are solid throughout.  Caine giving what has to be his best since Alfie, as he combines the world worn weary journalist with someone that refuses to see the horror until he has to relent to reality.  While understatedly - the man in the white suite - Fraser, supports Caine with a solidly ironic portrayal of American perfection:  Indeed the image of Pyle (Fraser) surrounded by the devastation of a local bomb blast, ignoring the dying to wipe the blood of stranger with a hanky from his white trouser leg will stay with me for sometime and is a perfect way of summing the essence of this movie up.The VerdictFowler is told in the film that one has to take sides in order to remain human, and it is this pull of the puppet strings that affect both character &amp; audience creating a paradox of engagement and disgust.  Political in its intentions, it blatantly desires to manipulate an audience rather than raise the stakes and focus on its source material, allowing one to make their own questions, impressions, and conclusions.  However, that aside Caine is truly excellent in this and from that stand point alone it should be seen, but as the movie makers are insistent on reminding us: beware the Quiet American.",3,A political essence,1073433600,"01 7, 2004",2004,3830,"['BriefIt', 'autumn', '1952', 'American', 'Aid', 'Worker', 'Alden', 'Pyle', 'Fraser', 'Saigon', 'A', 'period', 'conflict', 'prior', 'American', 'invasion', 'region', 'Vietnamese', 'fight', 'independence', 'French', 'colonial', 'rule', 'Befriending', 'Thomas', 'Fowler', 'Caine', 'London', 'Times', 'correspondent', 'Pyle', 'soon', 'love', 'Fowler', 'mistress', 'Hai', 'Yen', 'confusion', 'conflict', 'tempestuous', 'love', 'triangle', 'nothing', 'compared', 'murder', 'betrayal', 'hidden', 'truth', 'social', 'upheaval', 'country', 'be', 'closer', 'isolated', 'three', 'initially', 'apparent.ReviewPremiering', 'few', 'weeks', 'ago', 'part', 'Regus', 'London', 'Film', 'Festival', 'something', 'very', 'bitter', 'film', 'are', 'told', 'opening', 'scenes', 'smell', 'Saigon', 'promises', 'everything', 'exchange', 'soul', 'essentially', 'movie', 'down', 'analysing', 'concept', 'humanity', 'Do', 'humans', 'really', 'Yet', 'much', 'triangle', 'relationships', 'three', 'central', 'characters', 'simple', 'answer', 'be', 'one', 'always', 'what', 'other', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'subterfuge', 'film', 'compelling', 'journey', 'Fowler', 'discovery', 'truth', 'involvement', 'America', 'actions', 'independent', 'freedom', 'fighters', 'Yet', 'once', 'again', 'motives', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'sacrificial', 'appear', ""n't"", 'want', 'loose', 'position', 'mistress', 'so', 'must', 'urgently', 'find', 'big', 'story', 'order', 'justify', 'remaining.This', 'second', 'film', 'version', 'Graham', 'Greene', '1952', 'novel', 'political', 'intentions', 'original', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'subverted', 'light', 'recent', 'events', 'be', 'attempt', 'question', 'morality', 'western', 'superpowers', 'today', 'comparisons', 'past', 'summation', 'end', 'are', 'told', 'lives', 'lost', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'when', 'American', 'involvement', 'moved', 'shadows', 'foreground', 'eventually', '495,000', 'American', 'troops', 'died', 'conflict', 'undoubtedly', 'poignant', 'films', 'undoing', 'ultimate', 'weakness', 'Rather', 'engage', 'text', 'where', 'film', 'three', 'lives', 'two', 'stories', 'cross', 'become', 'entangled', 'are', 'attempts', 'parallel', 'today', 'either', 'directly', 'mentioned', 'unfortunately', 'indirectly', 'viewers', 'own', 'mind', 'due', 'timing', 'release', 'Indeed', 'many', 'believe', 'cause', 'scaled', 'down', 'opening', 'States.However', 'uneasily', 'film', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'Chris', 'Doyle', 'genius', 'many', 'ionic', 'Wong', 'Kar', 'Wai', 'films', 'performances', 'cast', 'are', 'solid', 'Caine', 'giving', 'be', 'best', 'Alfie', 'world', 'worn', 'weary', 'journalist', 'someone', 'see', 'horror', 'relent', 'reality', 'understatedly', 'man', 'white', 'suite', 'Fraser', 'Caine', 'solidly', 'ironic', 'portrayal', 'American', 'perfection', 'Indeed', 'image', 'Pyle', 'Fraser', 'surrounded', 'devastation', 'local', 'bomb', 'blast', 'ignoring', 'dying', 'wipe', 'blood', 'stranger', 'hanky', 'white', 'trouser', 'leg', 'will', 'stay', 'sometime', 'perfect', 'way', 'summing', 'essence', 'movie', 'up.The', 'VerdictFowler', 'told', 'film', 'one', 'take', 'sides', 'order', 'remain', 'human', 'pull', 'puppet', 'strings', 'affect', 'character', 'amp', 'audience', 'creating', 'paradox', 'engagement', 'disgust', 'Political', 'intentions', 'blatantly', 'manipulate', 'audience', 'rather', 'raise', 'stakes', 'focus', 'source', 'material', 'allowing', 'one', 'make', 'own', 'questions', 'impressions', 'conclusions', 'However', 'aside', 'Caine', 'truly', 'excellent', 'stand', 'point', 'alone', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'movie', 'makers', 'are', 'insistent', 'reminding', 'beware', 'Quiet', 'American']",N/A

British reporter, Thomas Fowler, has found a niche for himself in Vietnam reporting on the Vietnamese fight for independence from the French.  He is in love with a Vietnamese girl, and everything seems to be going well for him.  Then, he meets Alden Pyle, a medical liason officer who falls in love with Fowler's girlfriend, Phuong, while treating the indigenous people for a rare disease. Fowler begins to notice strange things occuring around him, and begins to wonder if Pyle is really what he seems to be.  This is an excellent movie with beautiful cinematography, a well-told story, and fully developed characters.  By the end of the movie, you find yourself fully captivated by the story as the truth comes to light.  Highly recommended.Michael Caine fully deserved his Oscar nomination as British reporter, Thomas Fowler, who finds himself in a troubling situation in Vietnam.  He must deal with issues that he has always been able to push aside in the past as his life changes around him.  Brendan Fraser is excellent as Alden Pyle, the medical liasons officer who befriend Fowler and falls in love with his girlfriend, Phuong, played by the beautiful, Do Thi Hai Yen.  The three stars of the movie all give fantastic performances throughout as well as the supporting cast including Tzi Ma, Rade Serbedzija, Robert Stanton, Holmes Osborne, and Quang Hai.  The DVD offers a beautiful widescreen presentation, commentary from cast and crew, a Vietnam timeline, ""Anatomy of a Scene"" the Sundance show, an original featurette, and book reviews for Graham Greene's book on which the movie is based.

608084,ALN0TTRTLHA4E,B00005JLXB,"Tom Munro ""tomfrombrunswick""","[4, 13]","The film is a love about a love triangle. Old journalist whose life is in stall lives in Vietnam and has an attractive young mistress. Young American comes to Vietnam and falls in love with old mans mistress. He can offer her marriage children and a life of decency. The old journalist can only offer a few years of glorified prostitution.The film is from the prospective of the journalist played by Michael Caine in slow motion. The younger man is played by Brendon Fraser showing his acting range. The cinematography is tremendous and lots of the outdoor locations are set in Vietnam. The love object Do Thi Hai Yen is a glory to behold.The book on which the film was based was also about the political struggle in Vietnam and the role of America. In the 1950's Britain was dumping its empire whilst America was rising to world power. Greene seems to have seen them as the new kids on the block, brash keen but lacking that sophistication, understanding and skill needed in your real empire builder. The book reflects that approach in the character played by Fraser.Transposed to the film it all appears a bit odd. No one who watches it now would realise the attitudes and prejudices of Greene. Rather the film shows the Fraser character to be a sort of bady compared to one of the employees of Caine a communist agent. A film which suggests that a committed communist is a noble character is something of a rarity in modern cinema.For the film to work one has to sympathise with the character played by Caine. Yet it is hard to do so because in reality he is just a [weak] old character violating the economically vulnerable Vietnamese girl.  One watches it and emerges with a feeling of mild revulsion.

608085,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JLXB,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 4]","I an no Graham Greene fan, but I know this 'The Quiet American' (second version after the 1958 version) is made with heartily-felt respect to this author.  It is an intelligent view on the war-time Vietnam before US government started to get involved into the area, but it is also a romantic story about the three characters, played by Michael Caine, Brendan Fraser, and Do Thai Hai Yen.  Both way you can enjoy it.The time is 1952, the place Saigon, and the French army is losing the war.  To the jaded eye of British journalist Thomas Fawler (Caine), however, his affair with the Vietnamese girl Phuong (DO Thai Hai Yen) occupies his mind most.  But he might be summoned back to the UK where his wife is waiting, and to prevent that, he needs another report to send to London.And an quiet, suave, nice-looking man appears before him.  Alden (Fraser) is a nice guy, to be sure, but he seems to be attracted to Phuong too much, Fawler begins to think.  And one unaccountable thing is, this American keeps on showing up before the journalist at the most unexpected place.  Who is he, and what does he want?As you know, Greene is known for his Catholic background, but basically his novels belong to the category of mystery -- see his 'The Third Man' -- and 'The Quiet American' is no exception.  But the most attractive side of the film is not that part; it is the entangled love relations between the three, and all the three actors show superb acting, especially Michael Caine (who is nominated for Oscar here).  He is exactly the face of the film, and deserves every praise given to it.Christopher Doyle gives good photography (but he downplays his techinique, which tends to give emphasis to overflowing light), and Director Philip Noyce, as he did in 'Rabbit-Proof Fence,' maintains the well-regulated pace throughout the film.  No overblown actions nor sugar-coated love scenes are included.The only thing I regret is that, after all, we know the outcome of the war (the novel was written in 1955) and some part tells it.  I cannot reveal too much, but the characterization (or the secret) of 'The Queit American' is no longer surprising.  I don't say it's a cliche, but other Hollywood films seem to have used it up years ago.  This film is not to be faulted, I know, but it cannot be ignored either.Still, it is a great drama which is made with intelligence, and Michael Caine represents that intelligence quite well.

608086,AVGGEAI1YGSAP,B00005JLXB,Tucker Andersen,"[20, 25]","This is a wonderful adaptation of Graham Greene's prescient and insightful novel concerning America's  likely involvement in Vietnam after the French withdrew from IndoChina during the 1950's. The movie opens with Alden Pyle (Brendan Fraser perfectly cast as the quiet American) floating dead in the river flowing through Saigon. The story then reverts to a chronological order to recount the events leading to his death. The narrator and central character is Thomas Fowler (Michael Caine), a London Times correspondent who has remained emotionally detached from the events of the war but has developed a strong emotional attachment to his mistress Phoung (Do Thi Hai Yen). Pyle meets Fowler and introduces himself as an American interested in helping the Vietnamese with medical aid. When Pyle meets Phoung he is instantly capitivated by her; once he learns that Fowler cannot obtain a divorce from his Catholic wife who has remained in England, he decides to propose to her and offers to marry her in America.As the story progresses, the intricacies of the love triangle are interwoven with the revelation that Pyle is a clandestine US operative supporting a renegade general attempting to move into the power vacuum that the exit of the French and partition of the country will create. There is considerable violence and terrorism portrayed, true to the actual events of the times. As Pyle's role in this violence is revealed, Fowler eventually has to take sides when his assistant Hinh (Tzi Ma) requests his help. Fowler's deceit regarding Phoung and his worldly cynicism offer a stark contrast to the (perhaps misguided) idealism of Pyle near the conclusion of the film. Of course, Fowler's relationship with Pyle and his apparent motive (Phoung) lead  to him becoming a suspect of Inspector Vigot (Rade Serbedzija), but Vigot admits that the evidence is all circumstantial and never proceeds further. Meanwhile, the conclusion provides an addendum of the history of the next decade and reveals the powerful accuracy of the novel's insights when viewed with the benefit of historical hindsight.This is a wonderful movie with superb directing and editing, beautiful cinematography (filmed on site in Saigon) and excellent performances by the cast. Micheal Caine shows his versatility; his performance was certainly as good as the other Academy award nominees. (I have not see Adrien Brody in THE PIANIST.)This is a story about the arrogance of power and the tragedy of good intentions that was scheduled to be released shortly after the 9/11 WTC terrorist attack but was kept in the can by the studio given the circumstances and its implicit message regarding American foreign policy. It was only released in late 2002 due to the the strenuous efforts of Micheal Caine and his belief in both the film and his performance. And while it may well be viewed as a commentary on current events, the situations are very different in all respects. This is a wonderful movie and I highly recommend it for anyone who enjoys a well told, thought provoking story that raises significant issues about human action and motivations. While I enjoyed it immensely, I rated it only four stars because it is basically a meaningful yet simple story extremely very well told; I believe one more viewing would be sufficient for me. It lacks the action, complexity, emotional impact, or humor that I require to want to purchase a DVD in order to enjoy viewing a film repeatedly and which is my usual criteria for a five star rating.",4,Five Stars for Michael Caine -The Tragedy of Good Intentions,1047945600,"03 18, 2003",2003,3513,"['wonderful', 'adaptation', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'prescient', 'insightful', 'novel', 'concerning', 'America', 'likely', 'involvement', 'Vietnam', 'French', 'withdrew', 'IndoChina', '1950', 'movie', 'Alden', 'Pyle', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'quiet', 'American', 'floating', 'dead', 'river', 'flowing', 'Saigon', 'story', 'then', 'chronological', 'order', 'recount', 'events', 'leading', 'death', 'narrator', 'central', 'character', 'Thomas', 'Fowler', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'London', 'Times', 'correspondent', 'who', 'remained', 'emotionally', 'detached', 'events', 'war', 'developed', 'strong', 'emotional', 'attachment', 'mistress', 'Phoung', 'Do', 'Thi', 'Hai', 'Yen', 'Pyle', 'meets', 'Fowler', 'American', 'interested', 'helping', 'Vietnamese', 'medical', 'aid', 'When', 'Pyle', 'Phoung', 'instantly', 'capitivated', 'once', 'Fowler', 'can', 'not', 'obtain', 'divorce', 'Catholic', 'wife', 'who', 'remained', 'England', 'propose', 'marry', 'America.As', 'story', 'intricacies', 'love', 'triangle', 'are', 'interwoven', 'revelation', 'Pyle', 'clandestine', 'US', 'operative', 'supporting', 'renegade', 'general', 'attempting', 'move', 'power', 'vacuum', 'exit', 'French', 'partition', 'country', 'will', 'create', 'considerable', 'violence', 'terrorism', 'portrayed', 'true', 'actual', 'events', 'times', 'Pyle', 'role', 'violence', 'revealed', 'Fowler', 'eventually', 'take', 'sides', 'when', 'assistant', 'Hinh', 'Tzi', 'Ma', 'help', 'Fowler', 'deceit', 'regarding', 'Phoung', 'worldly', 'cynicism', 'offer', 'stark', 'contrast', 'perhaps', 'misguided', 'idealism', 'Pyle', 'conclusion', 'film', 'course', 'Fowler', 'relationship', 'Pyle', 'apparent', 'motive', 'Phoung', 'lead', 'becoming', 'suspect', 'Inspector', 'Vigot', 'Rade', 'Serbedzija', 'Vigot', 'evidence', 'circumstantial', 'never', 'proceeds', 'further', 'Meanwhile', 'conclusion', 'addendum', 'history', 'next', 'decade', 'powerful', 'accuracy', 'novel', 'insights', 'when', 'viewed', 'benefit', 'historical', 'hindsight.This', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'superb', 'directing', 'editing', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'filmed', 'site', 'Saigon', 'excellent', 'performances', 'cast', 'Micheal', 'Caine', 'versatility', 'performance', 'was', 'certainly', 'as', 'good', 'other', 'Academy', 'award', 'nominees', 'have', 'not', 'see', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'THE', 'PIANIST', 'story', 'arrogance', 'power', 'tragedy', 'good', 'intentions', 'was', 'scheduled', 'be', 'released', 'shortly', '9/11', 'WTC', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'was', 'kept', 'can', 'studio', 'given', 'circumstances', 'implicit', 'message', 'regarding', 'American', 'foreign', 'policy', 'was', 'only', 'released', 'late', '2002', 'due', 'strenuous', 'efforts', 'Micheal', 'Caine', 'belief', 'film', 'performance', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'viewed', 'commentary', 'current', 'events', 'situations', 'are', 'very', 'different', 'respects', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'well', 'told', 'thought', 'provoking', 'story', 'significant', 'issues', 'human', 'action', 'motivations', 'enjoyed', 'immensely', 'rated', 'only', 'four', 'stars', 'basically', 'meaningful', 'yet', 'simple', 'story', 'extremely', 'very', 'well', 'told', 'believe', 'one', 'more', 'viewing', 'would', 'be', 'sufficient', 'action', 'complexity', 'emotional', 'impact', 'humor', 'require', 'want', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'order', 'enjoy', 'viewing', 'film', 'repeatedly', 'usual', 'criteria', 'five', 'star', 'rating']",N/A
608087,ASJ89T42CIUHU,B00005JLXB,V. Marshall,"[0, 1]","A picture filmed beautifully and full of dilemmas. Originally a book by Graham Greene, this story is compelling from simple beginning to bitter end.Michael Caine plays an English reporter in 1950's Vietnam. Caine is brilliant in this role and has moments of complete vulnerability. He lives with a young Vietnamese woman named Phuong (played by actress Do Thi Hai Yen) and uses her as his cushion while ignoring his wife. At some point in the film the question arises on whether or not Caine's character is in love with Phuong or merely holding her as a possession. This dilemma complicates the role of Phuong as well, why would a beautiful young woman spend her time with such an old coot? It turns out that love is only about money and status in 1950's Vietnam. Both characters become interesting backed by this complication and the way they use one another understandable to some extent but also sad.An innocent American, played by Brendan Fraser, appears on the scene and befriends the English reporter and claims to fall in love with Phuong. He carries on a friendship with Caine's character while hunting his mistress behind his back. It seems creepy and sly but if he really loves the woman wouldn't it be a better situation for Phuong? Yet another dilemma to ponder during this complicated film. Fraser is excellent as the conniving American with a few tricks up his sleeve revealed slowly through a series of dangerous situations.Caine and Fraser play brilliantly off one another in this film with both actors stepping out of their normal safety zones. The film will leave you wondering how justified the Americans were in their involvement in the Vietnam war.....if it started wrong why shouldn't it end wrong? The ending of the film is something to contemplate begging a decision between right and wrong where violence is concerned. In a country where people and politics are merely tools it is hard to make such choices and right and wrong becomes frayed at the edges.

The mood is one of expectations and you will not be left in limbo. The filtered lighting makes for a mysterious setting.This is a movie about a love triangle, impending chaos and betrayal. Not heavy on political, but a touch of intrigue andthe French Indo-China war in Vietnam.The opening scene may seem to end the plot, but, I assure you it only gets better.Michael Caine as(Thomas Fowler) is a reporter who has been resting on his laurels and letting the war slip by him. He says he is not an correspondent but rather a 'reporter' for a newspaper in London. He is heavy into opium and drink and has a local concubine as well as a wife in England. He meets Brenden as(Alden Pyle)at a sidewalk cafe. He says he is with the medical corp to help out the native people. He has the thankless job of being the protagonist in this movie. And he does a great job.Do Thi Hai Yen as (Phong)Plays the love interestfor both men and the one Pyle wants to save from Fowler. She is beautiful and plays her role well, but is only secondary to the main characters od Fowler and Pyle.This is a must see movie , well acted , great cinematography, and the music score is very mood setting.I give this flick a 5/5/ciao yaaah69",5,"SOMBER, AS IN DARK COLORED, HUSH, HUSH!!",1046822400,"03 5, 2003",2003,1349,"['one', 'best', 'movies', 'out', '2003', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'forgotten', 'awards', 'acting', 'excellent', 'as', 'well', 'cinematography', 'mood', 'one', 'expectations', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'left', 'limbo', 'filtered', 'lighting', 'mysterious', 'setting.This', 'movie', 'love', 'triangle', 'impending', 'chaos', 'betrayal', 'Not', 'heavy', 'political', 'touch', 'intrigue', 'andthe', 'French', 'Indo-China', 'war', 'Vietnam.The', 'opening', 'scene', 'may', 'seem', 'end', 'plot', 'assure', 'only', 'better.Michael', 'Caine', 'Thomas', 'Fowler', 'reporter', 'who', 'been', 'resting', 'laurels', 'letting', 'war', 'slip', 'not', 'correspondent', 'rather', ""'reporter"", 'newspaper', 'London', 'heavy', 'opium', 'drink', 'local', 'concubine', 'as', 'well', 'wife', 'England', 'Brenden', 'Alden', 'Pyle', 'sidewalk', 'cafe', 'medical', 'corp', 'help', 'out', 'native', 'people', 'thankless', 'job', 'being', 'protagonist', 'movie', 'great', 'job.Do', 'Thi', 'Hai', 'Yen', 'Phong', 'love', 'men', 'one', 'Pyle', 'save', 'Fowler', 'beautiful', 'role', 'well', 'only', 'secondary', 'main', 'characters', 'od', 'Fowler', 'Pyle.This', 'must', 'see', 'movie', 'well', 'acted', 'great', 'cinematography', 'music', 'score', 'very', 'mood', 'setting.I', 'give', 'flick', '5/5/ciao', 'yaaah69']",N/A
608089,A2B8GXSCB1R05T,B00005JLXB,Zack Davisson,"[4, 5]","I saw ""The Quiet American"" for the love story, not for the politics.  The triangle between the aging Brit Thomas Fowler, the idealistic American Alden Pyle and the not-so naive Vietnamese Phuong was beautifully and realistically portrayed, with strong performances on all sides.  In a way, the love story was very much like ""Casablanca,"" with the political Pyle, the world-weary Fowler, and the beautiful Phuong desired by both. The two men both considered themselves in Phuong's best interest, while she was looking for honesty, love and commitment, something neither man could provide.That being said, the political aspect of the film was deeply intriguing, showing a side of the Vietnam war that I had never seen before.  All of the movies I had watched were post-US involvement, or, such as Oliver Stone's ""Heaven and Earth,"" showing escalation from the Vietnamese point of view.  It is easy to watch war movies only for the conflict, forgetting the quiet unease before the violence.The film is beautiful as well, slow paced and elegant.  Vietnam is a lovely country, and ""The Quiet American"" plays it to full advantage.  There is nostalgia here, and knowledge of an innocent soon to be lost, but also the statement that one should appreciate things while they are there, regardless of the future.People live lives at all stages of history.  They lie and are honest.  They love and betray.  Even in the midst of the sparks that would soon consume a country, human beings are still human.",5,A moving love story,1141776000,"03 8, 2006",2006,1491,"['saw', 'Quiet', 'American', 'love', 'story', 'not', 'politics', 'triangle', 'aging', 'Brit', 'Thomas', 'Fowler', 'idealistic', 'American', 'Alden', 'Pyle', 'not-so', 'naive', 'Vietnamese', 'Phuong', 'was', 'beautifully', 'realistically', 'portrayed', 'strong', 'performances', 'sides', 'way', 'love', 'story', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'Casablanca', 'political', 'Pyle', 'world-weary', 'Fowler', 'beautiful', 'Phuong', 'desired', 'two', 'men', 'considered', 'Phuong', 'best', 'interest', 'was', 'looking', 'honesty', 'love', 'commitment', 'something', 'man', 'could', 'provide.That', 'being', 'said', 'political', 'aspect', 'film', 'was', 'deeply', 'intriguing', 'showing', 'side', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'movies', 'had', 'watched', 'were', 'post-US', 'involvement', 'such', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'Heaven', 'Earth', 'showing', 'escalation', 'Vietnamese', 'point', 'view', 'easy', 'watch', 'war', 'movies', 'only', 'conflict', 'forgetting', 'quiet', 'unease', 'violence.The', 'film', 'beautiful', 'as', 'well', 'slow', 'paced', 'elegant', 'Vietnam', 'lovely', 'country', 'Quiet', 'American', 'full', 'advantage', 'nostalgia', 'here', 'knowledge', 'innocent', 'soon', 'be', 'lost', 'also', 'statement', 'one', 'should', 'appreciate', 'things', 'are', 'there', 'regardless', 'future.People', 'live', 'lives', 'stages', 'history', 'lie', 'are', 'honest', 'love', 'betray', 'Even', 'midst', 'sparks', 'would', 'soon', 'consume', 'country', 'human', 'beings', 'are', 'still', 'human']",N/A
