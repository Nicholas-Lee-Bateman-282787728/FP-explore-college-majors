217467,A28QAR4664DBGG,6300215644,,"[3, 3]","Great film- filmed actually from autumn 1949 to early 1950. The films moral premise is now dated, but the moral dilemmas of the main players is eternal. Filmed in luminous Black & white, George Stevens uses the camera to almost perfection, moving from the distance to incredible closeups. The scene of Taylor and Clift on the terrace is one of the most erotic pieces of mid 20th century cinema.Stevens also uses Franz Waxmans striking  award winning soundtrack very effectively. Clift gives a brilliant performance- tense, but hauntingly lonely and distant. His hesitations and painful vulnerability where ground breaking for a male lead-and ushered in a new style of acting.Winters also gives a brilliant performance as the dowdy working girl. Taylor gives the best performance of her career at 18 years of age.A great film that shows the misdirected aspirations of American free enterprise- and the tragedy it can produce.",5,Famous Film,1147737600,"05 16, 2006",2006,924,"['Great', 'film-', 'filmed', 'actually', 'autumn', '1949', 'early', '1950', 'films', 'moral', 'premise', 'now', 'dated', 'moral', 'dilemmas', 'main', 'players', 'eternal', 'Filmed', 'luminous', 'Black', 'white', 'George', 'Stevens', 'camera', 'almost', 'perfection', 'moving', 'distance', 'incredible', 'closeups', 'scene', 'Taylor', 'Clift', 'terrace', 'one', 'most', 'erotic', 'pieces', 'mid', '20th', 'century', 'cinema.Stevens', 'also', 'Franz', 'Waxmans', 'striking', 'award', 'winning', 'soundtrack', 'very', 'effectively', 'Clift', 'brilliant', 'performance-', 'tense', 'hauntingly', 'lonely', 'distant', 'hesitations', 'painful', 'vulnerability', 'where', 'ground', 'breaking', 'male', 'lead-and', 'ushered', 'new', 'style', 'acting.Winters', 'also', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'dowdy', 'working', 'girl', 'Taylor', 'best', 'performance', 'career', '18', 'years', 'age.A', 'great', 'film', 'misdirected', 'aspirations', 'American', 'free', 'enterprise-', 'tragedy', 'can', 'produce']",N/A

He has a note from the owner of the local company. George Eastman wants a job at his uncle's factory. The wealthy Eastman family has a strict rule against socializing with their many female employees. But George happens to meet an employee at the movies and walks Alice Tripp home. [Would she be out alone in those days?] There is an attraction between this lonely pair. A policeman finds them parked and sends them away. They go back to the rooming house.George is moved up to a new position at work. He seems out of place among the wealthy at the Eastman mansion. He meets Angela Vickers, a wealthy heiress, and they become friends. George must keep his relationship with Alice secret. But she is in trouble so their relationship will be revealed. George is getting involved with Angela as well. There is a crisis, and George starts to make plans to solve his problem. He visits Angela at Loon Lake, where the water is so deep and cold that drowned bodies can't be found. [This is told about one of the Finger Lakes of New York.] Later there is a crisis when Alice arrives at the bus station and demands marriage or else. George takes Alice for a picnic at Loon Lake. They rent a boat, George uses a false name. You can guess what happens next in the dark.The disappearance of the young couple is reported to the District Attorney. They find Alice Tripp's body and believe her male companion is still alive. The detectives visit Alice Tripp's room and find her letters, then talk to her landlady. They learn the name of her boyfriend. The law catches up with him and takes him to jail. Nobody knew of his double life. Angela Vickers' name will be kept out of the trial and the newspapers. Witnesses tell about the events. The case is circumstantial. Then George Eastman takes the stand and tells his story. It was an accident! The District Attorney gets damaging admissions from Eastman. The jury convicts him. His mother's plea to the Governor is rejected. The minister points out George's state of mind at the time. George says goodbye to Angela and walks his last mile.This love story is based on a play that was an adaption of the Theodore Dreiser novel ""An American Tragedy"" [as if it doesn't happen elsewhere]. Dreiser's novel was based on a true crime in upstate New York circa 1912. A story ""ripped from the headlines"" still sells today; there is no need for specific details. This story warns employees against involvement with supervisors.

Was George (Monty) an evil murderer?The answer is no; he was a normal male. He was faced with achoice--marry a pregnant Shelly Winters or marry a 19-year-oldElizabeth Taylor...hmmmm. We know that just before the accident (yesaccident!) he reluctantly accepts the former.Now as far as being a murderer, did he commit murder? NO, he didn't! Hewas convicted because the jury believed the prosecution's (RaymondBurr's) conjecture that he slammed Alice (Shelly) on the head with thepaddle. However we see exactly what happened; it was an accident a laChappaquiddick--an accident--one he tried to cover up yes-but 1stdegree murder?The main issue I have with this film is how he could have beenattracted to Alice (Shelly) in the first place? I mean it's believableto be attracted to Liz, but Shirley? We know now Monty's orientation,but even so his scenes with Liz I think were believable, and withShirley, not.And at the end his acceptance of his fate and ""guilt"", which the priestprompts him to do, was a cop out ending I believe, because it was likehe deserved the chair, when it's obvious to me he didn't--- jail timefor trying to cover up the accident, maybe. SPOILERS AHEAD---I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, ""you're overlooking thefact that George plotted the murder at least in his mind and began toact on it"". Yes, true to a certain extent. It's not, or at least shouldnot, be illegal to contemplate anything. But exactly what did he do toact on it? He pretended to run out of gas, rented a boat (it's not hisfault they didn't have life vests--the boat renter is responsible forthat), and then after realizing he could NOT act on this half-bakednotion, the accident occurred. That is the most half-heartedhalf-baked, half-a--ed murder plot in history. Yes, he gave a fake nameto the renter...however he showed his face...unless he wanted to getcaught and IDed, is that a murder plot? So to me he's guilty ofcovering up after the fact...nothing more.Overall a great film, though very widely misinterpreted.",4,George's choice between Shelly Winters and Elizabeth Taylor SPOILERS,1362268800,"03 3, 2013",2013,2140,"['POSSIBLE', 'SPOILERSI', 'think', 'many', 'people', 'miss', 'whole', 'point', 'film', 'least', 'theintent', 'central', 'character', 'Was', 'George', 'Monty', 'evil', 'murderer', 'answer', 'was', 'normal', 'male', 'was', 'faced', 'achoice', 'marry', 'pregnant', 'Shelly', 'Winters', 'marry', '19-year-oldElizabeth', 'Taylor', 'hmmmm', 'know', 'just', 'accident', 'yesaccident', 'reluctantly', 'former.Now', 'as', 'far', 'being', 'murderer', 'did', 'commit', 'murder', 'NO', 'did', ""n't"", 'Hewas', 'convicted', 'jury', 'believed', 'prosecution', 'RaymondBurr', 'conjecture', 'slammed', 'Alice', 'Shelly', 'head', 'thepaddle', 'However', 'see', 'exactly', 'what', 'happened', 'was', 'accident', 'laChappaquiddick', 'accident', 'one', 'tried', 'cover', 'up', 'yes-but', '1stdegree', 'murder', 'main', 'issue', 'have', 'film', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'beenattracted', 'Alice', 'Shelly', 'first', 'place', 'mean', 'believableto', 'be', 'attracted', 'Liz', 'Shirley', 'know', 'now', 'Monty', 'orientation', 'even', 'scenes', 'Liz', 'think', 'were', 'believable', 'withShirley', 'not.And', 'end', 'acceptance', 'fate', 'guilt', 'priestprompts', 'do', 'was', 'cop', 'ending', 'believe', 'was', 'likehe', 'deserved', 'chair', 'when', 'obvious', 'did', ""n't"", 'jail', 'timefor', 'trying', 'cover', 'up', 'accident', 'maybe', 'SPOILERS', 'AHEAD', '-I', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'thinking', ""'re"", 'thinking', ""'re"", 'overlooking', 'thefact', 'George', 'plotted', 'murder', 'least', 'mind', 'began', 'toact', 'Yes', 'true', 'certain', 'extent', 'not', 'least', 'shouldnot', 'be', 'illegal', 'contemplate', 'anything', 'exactly', 'what', 'did', 'do', 'toact', 'pretended', 'run', 'out', 'gas', 'rented', 'boat', 'not', 'hisfault', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'life', 'vests', 'boat', 'renter', 'responsible', 'forthat', 'then', 'realizing', 'could', 'NOT', 'act', 'half-bakednotion', 'accident', 'occurred', 'most', 'half-heartedhalf-baked', 'half-a', 'ed', 'murder', 'plot', 'history', 'Yes', 'gave', 'fake', 'nameto', 'renter', 'however', 'showed', 'face', 'wanted', 'getcaught', 'IDed', 'murder', 'plot', 'So', 'guilty', 'ofcovering', 'up', 'fact', 'nothing', 'more.Overall', 'great', 'film', 'though', 'very', 'widely', 'misinterpreted']",N/A

In the eerie calm of a moonlit lake the fear and suspense of a shoddy row boat and a ever so nervous Clift leave you waiting for the deed of murder to take place!

217474,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,6300215644,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[0, 0]","AN AMERICAN TRAGEDY was the mammoth 1925 novel by American naturalist Theodore Dreiser which itself was based on a real 1906 event about a drowning in an Upstate New York lake.  It had been filmed in 1931 with the Naturalism intact, but was not a success.  In 1951 George Stevens directed a somewhat modernized version of the story, as A PLACE IN THE SUN, starring Montgomery Clift, Elizabeth Taylor and Shelley Winters.  The challenge lay in converting an 880-page novel from an earlier era into a contemporary (and not overlong) feature film, to integrate the glamour and the grit, so to speak.  The results are so successful that A PLACE IN THE SUN certainly deserves to be called a Hollywood classic, a term I and other reviewers sometimes overuse, but not here.  Upon seeing a preview of the movie, Charlie Chaplin said it was the best American film he had ever seen!Young George Eastman (Clift), son of Salvation Army-type street missionaries, hitchhikes from the Midwest back East and lands in Carthage (probably Upstate New York), a factory town dominated by a couple of industrial families, Eastman and Vickers.  Thanks to a note of introduction from his tycoon uncle, George secures a menial job on the assembly line at the Eastman mill, packaging women's swimsuits for retail, and on the line  meets a mousy but nonetheless fetching local girl, Alice (Shelley Winters).  Their employer forbids fraternization between the sexes but the two strike up a clandestine relationship anyway.  Meanwhile, in a familial beau geste, George's uncle condescends to invite George to a party at the baronial family mansion, where he ""meets cute"" astonishingly pretty Angela Vickers (Elizabeth Taylor), daughter of the town's other leading industrialist.  They start going together, and the unpretentious and mild-mannered George starts making inroads with Angela's autocratic family as well as with her set of friends.  But while George is at the Vickers' luxurious vacation house up at Loon Lake, he receives a phone call from Alice, insisting that they be married--right now--(for the usual cinematic reason) lest she phone the newspapers and let everyone know about his other life, the one that didn't get reported in the society columns with Angela Vickers and her set.  George responds by picking up Alice at the bus station and taking her out on a deserted Loon Lake in a rowboat.  They get into an argument midlake; at one point Alice hops up and overturns the rowboat.  While they were both submerged did George drown Alice, or try to save her and fail, or just swim off and save himself?  We don't always know, but an investigation and trial follow. The wonderfully informative Commentary that came with this DVD indicates how the trial sequence, which had originally run far too long, was recut from suspense to inevitability, keeping the tragedy intact.George Stevens was a deliberate and in some ways conservative director and he exploits the Hollywood grab-bag of cinematic tropes to the hilt in this film.  Falling calendar pages indicate the passage of time; a factory whistle harshly calls lovers back to their tasks from a tryst.  The drab factory girls on the assembly line are oppressed symbolically by large and pervasive posters of recumbent Eastman glamour girls, so alluring in their company bathing suits, in a workplace that doesn't even allow male-female fraternization. Stevens was sparing with close-ups, and therefore the ones he employed are particularly striking, such as the iconic shot of Taylor and Clift together in a convertible, or the look of panic on Alice's face, clearly terrified of water as she fumbles her way into a rowboat.  The minor roles are peopled with veterans of stage and screen (Anne Revere, her last major screen role before she hit the Blacklist) as well as newcomers on the way up (Raymond Burr, as a surprisingly forceful District Attorney).  Look very quickly for William Frawley as a killjoy cop stifling the couples on Lover's Lane and Kathleen Freeman as a witness at George's murder trial.Stylistically, a recurrent feature of this film are the s-l-o-w dissolves that relate one scene to another: for instance, a long-distance phone call factory owner Eastman urges George to make ties the posh Eastman mansion to George's missionary mother in a run-down settlement house (was the sign on the wall at the mission asking ""Have you written to your mother?"" thematic glue or a little overkill?  Opinions will vary).  Stevens, like all other Hollywood directors, had the hated and feared Production Code to contend with.  Note how gently George and Alice come together and dance in her shabby room, on a rainy night with the radio playing an insinuating rhumba--and how, after the camera gently edges the presumed lovers offscreen, morning intrudes with another slow dissolve to daylight and radio static.  Shortly after, when Alice tells George, ""I'm in trouble . . .  I'm in TROUBLE,"" we know she's in a condition the Code would only allow a hint of.  Likewise when Alice visits a doctor she hopes will consent to an abortion she is turned away, both characters fully understanding the situation but neither one having used the forbidden ""A"" word.Thematically, and almost inevitably, there is occasional dissonance in this film between the era of postwar affluence America was experiencing at the time this movie was made and the social strictures more typical of the time the novel was written (all the moreso 1906, when the background drowning that formed the story actually took place).  When the Vickers and Eastman families hold their fetes, the black-tie-clad guests and Viennese waltzes were anachronistic in 1951, even among overcompensating provincial nouveaux riches; likewise out of time are some of the Carthage street scenes among the working class, the downtown Turkish baths, the sordid rooming houses with their no-visitation rules, and the landladies' morbid fear of scandal and gossip.  These are minor shake-downs, though, in this otherwise brilliant film.  I am happy to say that my new DVD, while quite inexpensive, looks beautiful on the new HDTV, the cinematographer's art as well as George Stevens' careful camera placement both very much in evidence.  It sounds great, too: as one small example, Stevens worked hard to find just the right sound for a powerboat, and wound up using the muscular thrust of a German Stuka dive bomber!  Franz Waxman's operatic and lushly romantic film score is carefully nuanced, with a leitmotiv for every major character.  This film is very highly recommended; few will be sorry they added it to their film library.Comparison imdb ratings:FATHER OF THE BRIDE  7.2A PLACE IN THE SUN  7.8A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE

217477,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,6300215644,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 2]","A PLACE IN THE SUN (from director George Stevens) is a noirish romance starring Liz Taylor and Monty Clift. In it, Clift is nephew to wealthy Charles Eastman (Heyes). After the death of his missionary father, young George (Clift) visits Mr. Eastman and secures a job in the family factory. His relatives see George as a lower class outsider (which he clearly is), so they don't associate with him.Hard work pays off and George advances over time to a minor management position. Despite warnings against fraternization with female employees, he becomes the lover of factory girl Alice Tripp (Winters).At a family get-together, Angela Vickers notices George, who saw and became infatuated with her on his very first visit to Mr. Eastman. The two fall hard for each other despite concerns of Angela's parents, who like the Eastmans consider George as declass&eacute;. A further complication arises when Alice announces that she's pregnant. George stalls on marrying her, so a vengeful Alice threatens to tell the press and the Eastmans of their liason to make certain he loses his job. Deeply in love with Angela, George wants to be rid of troublesome Alice even if it takes an act of violence to do so...""A Place in the Sun"" is a perfect example of why some films should be in color. There's scenes in this b&w; movie of a secluded lake, plus close-ups of a strikingly beautiful Liz that just scream for Techncolor. Her looks are diminished by b&w; cinematography; that perfect skin and violet eyes look ordinary here.As for Mr. Clift, you've gotta feel for this tragic man. Close-ups of him reveal someone who's already living a hard llfe. There's a small scar on his right cheek and a huge one running down his neck on the same side, and he just doesn't seem all that healthy. This beat-up appearance was five years before a disfiguring car accident that occurred during the filming ofRAINTREE COUNTY(1956), another picture Monty made with Liz.I've read that Clift was the big love of Taylor's life, but it was unrequited, of course. In 1966, he died alone in his NYC apartment, apparently of a heart occlusion caused by drug abuse.(NOTE: Watch for a priestly cameo from cartoon voice specialist Paul Frees.)Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.(7.7) A Place in the Sun (1951) - Montgomery Clift/Elizabeth Taylor/Sheley Winters/Fred Clark/Raymond Burr/Herbert Hees/Ted de Corsia/Paul Frees",4,"George: ""...I guess maybe I've even loved you before I saw you.""",1255564800,"10 15, 2009",2009,2426,"['PLACE', 'IN', 'THE', 'SUN', 'director', 'George', 'Stevens', 'noirish', 'romance', 'starring', 'Liz', 'Taylor', 'Monty', 'Clift', 'Clift', 'nephew', 'wealthy', 'Charles', 'Eastman', 'Heyes', 'death', 'missionary', 'father', 'young', 'George', 'Clift', 'Mr.', 'Eastman', 'job', 'family', 'factory', 'relatives', 'see', 'George', 'lower', 'class', 'outsider', 'clearly', 'do', ""n't"", 'associate', 'him.Hard', 'work', 'pays', 'George', 'advances', 'time', 'minor', 'management', 'position', 'warnings', 'fraternization', 'female', 'employees', 'lover', 'factory', 'girl', 'Alice', 'Tripp', 'Winters', '.At', 'family', 'get-together', 'Angela', 'Vickers', 'notices', 'George', 'who', 'saw', 'became', 'infatuated', 'very', 'first', 'visit', 'Mr.', 'Eastman', 'two', 'fall', 'hard', 'other', 'concerns', 'Angela', 'parents', 'who', 'Eastmans', 'consider', 'George', 'declass', 'eacute', 'further', 'complication', 'arises', 'when', 'Alice', 'pregnant', 'George', 'marrying', 'vengeful', 'Alice', 'tell', 'press', 'Eastmans', 'liason', 'make', 'certain', 'job', 'Deeply', 'love', 'Angela', 'George', 'be', 'rid', 'troublesome', 'Alice', 'even', 'act', 'violence', 'do', 'so', 'Place', 'Sun', 'perfect', 'example', 'why', 'films', 'should', 'be', 'color', 'scenes', 'b', 'w', 'movie', 'secluded', 'lake', 'close-ups', 'strikingly', 'beautiful', 'Liz', 'just', 'scream', 'Techncolor', 'looks', 'are', 'diminished', 'b', 'w', 'cinematography', 'perfect', 'skin', 'violet', 'eyes', 'look', 'ordinary', 'here.As', 'Mr.', 'Clift', ""'ve"", 'got', 'ta', 'feel', 'tragic', 'man', 'Close-ups', 'reveal', 'someone', 'who', 'already', 'living', 'hard', 'llfe', 'small', 'scar', 'right', 'cheek', 'huge', 'one', 'running', 'down', 'neck', 'same', 'side', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'healthy', 'beat-up', 'appearance', 'was', 'five', 'years', 'disfiguring', 'car', 'accident', 'occurred', 'filming', 'ofRAINTREE', 'COUNTY', '1956', 'picture', 'Monty', 'made', 'Liz.I', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Clift', 'was', 'big', 'love', 'Taylor', 'life', 'was', 'unrequited', 'course', '1966', 'died', 'alone', 'NYC', 'apartment', 'apparently', 'heart', 'occlusion', 'caused', 'drug', 'abuse', 'NOTE', 'Watch', 'priestly', 'cameo', 'cartoon', 'voice', 'specialist', 'Paul', 'Frees', 'Parenthetical', 'number', 'preceding', 'title', '1', '10', 'IMDb', 'viewer', 'poll', 'rating', '7.7', 'Place', 'Sun', '1951', 'Montgomery', 'Clift/Elizabeth', 'Taylor/Sheley', 'Winters/Fred', 'Clark/Raymond', 'Burr/Herbert', 'Hees/Ted', 'Corsia/Paul', 'Frees']",N/A

It's a good thing I took the time because the movie is nothing like it. That way, I am unable to be harsh in my review about the movie since I can't remember a lot about the actual story except for the main points. On the surface, Montgomery Clift seems to act well in A Place in the Sun, but let's be real: he is terrible. Knowing the real story of murderer that inspired Dreiser to write the novel, I presume that being naive at all times throughout, like how Montgomery Clift did as George Eastman, was an unrealistic behavior for somebody who might be predisposed to murder. Obviously, in the book An American Tragedy, past behavior predicts future behavior. In A Place in the Sun, Montgomery Clift shows up unannounced as an all-around good kid minus a formal education and carries on with his manners intact with no change over time. In other words, it is truly a one-dimensional performance that makes me hard to believe in his character and the rest of the results. On the other hand, Elizabeth Taylor is obviously very beautiful and radiant as Angela Vickers, but she falls for an uneducated city boy with no social rank after feebly watching a minute of his solo billiards game. Come on, are we that stupid? And of course, Shelley Winters' character is thoroughly defeated by her looks alone. George Eastman's decision becomes quite simple. How she was killed in the film isn't enough for an execution but enough for a manslaughter or a lesser degree. The piece of lawyering by Raymond Burr's character is easily the worst and most ridiculous part of the picture. What he did is enough for witness intimidation and thus is grounds for a mistrial, especially during the ridiculous and over-the-top moment when he forcibly smashed the paddle on the boat during the trial. All in all, A Place in the Sun is an okay film but pales greatly in comparison with An American Tragedy.",4,Not An American Tragedy.,1375747200,"08 6, 2013",2013,2075,"['Viewed', '8/13Rate', '78/13', 'American', 'Tragedy', 'novel', 'written', 'Theodore', 'Dreiser', 'book', 'read', 'almost', 'two', 'decades', 'ago', 'never', 'got', 'see', 'film', 'Place', 'Sun', 'now', 'good', 'thing', 'took', 'time', 'movie', 'nothing', 'way', 'am', 'unable', 'be', 'harsh', 'review', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'lot', 'actual', 'story', 'main', 'points', 'surface', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'act', 'well', 'A', 'Place', 'Sun', 'let', 'be', 'real', 'terrible', 'Knowing', 'real', 'story', 'murderer', 'inspired', 'Dreiser', 'write', 'novel', 'presume', 'being', 'naive', 'times', 'how', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'did', 'George', 'Eastman', 'was', 'unrealistic', 'behavior', 'somebody', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'predisposed', 'murder', 'Obviously', 'book', 'American', 'Tragedy', 'past', 'behavior', 'future', 'behavior', 'Place', 'Sun', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'up', 'unannounced', 'all-around', 'good', 'kid', 'formal', 'education', 'manners', 'intact', 'change', 'time', 'other', 'words', 'truly', 'one-dimensional', 'performance', 'hard', 'believe', 'character', 'rest', 'results', 'other', 'hand', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'obviously', 'very', 'beautiful', 'radiant', 'Angela', 'Vickers', 'uneducated', 'city', 'boy', 'social', 'rank', 'feebly', 'watching', 'minute', 'solo', 'billiards', 'game', 'Come', 'are', 'stupid', 'course', 'Shelley', 'Winters', 'character', 'thoroughly', 'defeated', 'looks', 'alone', 'George', 'Eastman', 'decision', 'quite', 'simple', 'How', 'was', 'killed', 'film', ""n't"", 'enough', 'execution', 'enough', 'manslaughter', 'lesser', 'degree', 'piece', 'lawyering', 'Raymond', 'Burr', 'character', 'easily', 'worst', 'most', 'ridiculous', 'part', 'picture', 'What', 'did', 'enough', 'witness', 'intimidation', 'thus', 'grounds', 'mistrial', 'especially', 'ridiculous', 'over-the-top', 'moment', 'when', 'forcibly', 'smashed', 'paddle', 'boat', 'trial', 'Place', 'Sun', 'okay', 'film', 'pales', 'greatly', 'comparison', 'American', 'Tragedy']",N/A

While Elizabeth Taylor is absolutely exquisite in this film (particularly in that white gown in the pooltable scene), and she does a good job as Angela, Clift is just outstanding. And he's not perfectly handsome (he's more striking, unusual, and scarred), but he has star appeal here, 100%. It's easy to see why he was nominated for Best Actor in ""A Place in the Sun"". His emotions run the gamut from mousy politeness to seething rage ... and he makes the audience believe that he is helplessly and deliriously in love with Angela Vickers. Clift's scenes with Taylor are great-- she must have brought out the best in him as an actor (or maybe George Stevens' direction did). I'm not a huge fan of love stories as a rule, but this one always impresses me and tugs at my heartstrings. I've seen it many times and its grip never dwindles somehow.It's sad that Clift's life in reality would be embroidered with tragedy and struggles and addiction, and then end in sudden death before reaching age fifty. But he left behind some strong film performances; many people think ""A Place in the Sun"" might be his greatest work in his (less than twenty) film roles. He will always be known as the brooding, moody, sensitive, intense man in cinema. If there's a trilogy of young and powerful actors from the 1950's, it is definitely Brando and Dean and Clift.Franz Waxman's Oscar-winning score is a gem, and one of my favorite classic movie scores. That melody that recurs throughout the movie is lovely.One of the standout scenes from ""A Place in the Sun"" is when Angela and George are dancing at the party and then escape to a terrace outside to share an intimate moment of confessing their mutual love. It's completely believeable... And one of the best Hollywood film kisses. I can't help getting caught up in this. Such is the magic of the movies.This film sweeps the viewer up in its aching romance and its taut suspense. The second hour tends to drag at times, but I forgive that considering the movie's excellent acting, writing, and direction. For my money, this is one of the best classic film love stories you can watch. This is genuine ""movie love"". I don't know how else to put it.

217481,A3Y6GNHCOER58,6300215644,Billie Mann,"[8, 8]","""A Place in the Sun"" tells the story of George Eastman (Montgomery Clift), a poor relation who goes to work in his rich uncle's factory. He starts at the bottom level, working the production line, and gets involved romantically and sexually with co-worker Alice Tripp (Shelley Winters), all the while yearning for the unattainable - the gorgeous Angela Vickers (Elizabeth Taylor). However, by the time he is able to finally be with Angela, his relationship with Alice interferes with his plans.The film is based on the novel ""An American Tragedy"", written by Theodore Dreiser in 1925. Elizabeth Taylor, who was only 17 at the time, was cast as Angela Vickers, the beautiful and rich love interest of George Eastman (Montgomery Clift). Shelley Winters is Alice Tripp, the woman who becomes a burden to Eastman, an obstacle to his love for Angela and her way of life. Stevens was reticent at first to cast Winters in the dowdy role; at the time she was known for portraying glamorous types or sexpots. She convinced Stevens to cast her by showing up in his office for her appointment with him dressed for the part, sitting silently when he came out and didn't recognize her for several minutes as he glanced around his outer office at the actresses waiting to see him.Raymond Burr, best known for his TV role as Perry Mason, plays a Perry Mason of sorts in the film: the prosecuting attorney, Frank Marlowe.This was the first of three films that Taylor and Clift made together; and they became instant friends upon meeting for the first time for the making of ""A Place in the Sun"". The chemistry between the two is evident, although Clift was in real life homosexual. They remained close friends until his death in 1966, at age 45, from a heart attack. Taylor has remarked that her first kiss with Clift in the film was the second time she had ever been actually kissed - the first time was two weeks before filming started.Director Stevens decided to take the story and set it in post-war times instead of in the 1920's, when the novel takes place, to take the atmosphere of wartime out of the feel of the story. The lushly filmed lake scenes have the look of an Ansel Adams photograph. Color would have been superfluous. The masterful use of shadows is evident throughout, and Stevens' several excruciatingly tight closeups of Taylor and Clift together serve to highlight her beauty and the chemistry between the two lead actors, heightening the sense of danger and romance.""A Place in the Sun"" was nominated for nine Academy Awards, winning six, including Best Director for George Stevens.Note:Dreiser's novel was based on an actual murder case of 1906 - the case of Chester Gillette.",4,"Wonderful, sorrowful, luminous film",1107907200,"02 9, 2005",2005,2685,"['Place', 'Sun', 'story', 'George', 'Eastman', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'poor', 'relation', 'who', 'work', 'rich', 'uncle', 'factory', 'bottom', 'level', 'working', 'production', 'line', 'involved', 'romantically', 'sexually', 'co-worker', 'Alice', 'Tripp', 'Shelley', 'Winters', 'while', 'yearning', 'unattainable', 'gorgeous', 'Angela', 'Vickers', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'However', 'time', 'able', 'finally', 'be', 'Angela', 'relationship', 'Alice', 'interferes', 'plans.The', 'film', 'based', 'novel', 'American', 'Tragedy', 'written', 'Theodore', 'Dreiser', '1925', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'who', 'was', 'only', '17', 'time', 'was', 'cast', 'Angela', 'Vickers', 'beautiful', 'rich', 'love', 'interest', 'George', 'Eastman', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'Shelley', 'Winters', 'Alice', 'Tripp', 'woman', 'who', 'burden', 'Eastman', 'obstacle', 'love', 'Angela', 'way', 'life', 'Stevens', 'was', 'reticent', 'first', 'cast', 'Winters', 'dowdy', 'role', 'time', 'was', 'known', 'portraying', 'glamorous', 'types', 'sexpots', 'convinced', 'Stevens', 'cast', 'showing', 'up', 'office', 'appointment', 'dressed', 'part', 'sitting', 'silently', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'did', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'several', 'minutes', 'glanced', 'outer', 'office', 'actresses', 'waiting', 'see', 'him.Raymond', 'Burr', 'best', 'known', 'TV', 'role', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'sorts', 'film', 'prosecuting', 'attorney', 'Frank', 'Marlowe.This', 'was', 'first', 'three', 'films', 'Taylor', 'Clift', 'made', 'together', 'became', 'instant', 'friends', 'meeting', 'first', 'time', 'making', 'Place', 'Sun', 'chemistry', 'two', 'evident', 'Clift', 'was', 'real', 'life', 'homosexual', 'remained', 'close', 'friends', 'death', '1966', 'age', '45', 'heart', 'attack', 'Taylor', 'remarked', 'first', 'kiss', 'Clift', 'film', 'was', 'second', 'time', 'had', 'ever', 'been', 'actually', 'kissed', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'two', 'weeks', 'filming', 'started.Director', 'Stevens', 'decided', 'take', 'story', 'set', 'post-war', 'times', 'instead', '1920', 'when', 'novel', 'place', 'take', 'atmosphere', 'wartime', 'feel', 'story', 'lushly', 'filmed', 'lake', 'scenes', 'have', 'look', 'Ansel', 'Adams', 'photograph', 'Color', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'superfluous', 'masterful', 'use', 'shadows', 'evident', 'Stevens', 'several', 'excruciatingly', 'tight', 'closeups', 'Taylor', 'Clift', 'together', 'serve', 'highlight', 'beauty', 'chemistry', 'two', 'lead', 'actors', 'heightening', 'sense', 'danger', 'romance', 'Place', 'Sun', 'was', 'nominated', 'nine', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'winning', 'six', 'including', 'Best', 'Director', 'George', 'Stevens.Note', 'Dreiser', 'novel', 'was', 'based', 'actual', 'murder', 'case', '1906', 'case', 'Chester', 'Gillette']",N/A

After all, doomed love is a bigger sell, especially when you have the romantic faces of Clift and Taylor swooning together in extreme close-up.I'm not a fan of doing book to movie comparisons.  I figure that film and literature are two different art forms, so I shouldn't compare their rendering of the story anymore than I would compare the same story as presented in a painting as opposed to a ballet.  So I tried to take the film on its own merits (admittedly difficult to do, since I watched the movie on the same day I finished the book), but even at that, I think the movie falls short.Clift plays George Eastman, poor nephew to a rich, socially elite family in a small New York state factory town. He's been invited by his uncle to come and work in the Eastman factory, giving him an entre into a world of luxury that has always been out of his grasp due to his family's humble position (they run a mission and preach on the streets).  George strikes up a love affair with Alice Tripp (Shelley Winters), a girl who works with him in the factory, but his attentions for her quickly fade when he becomes interested in Angela Vickers, another member of the rich set, played by Liz Taylor.  Complications ensue, and George finds himself and his situation spiralling drastically out of control, with an ending more tragic than he ever thought possible.George Stevens directs the film with a sure hand, and there are some breathtaking displays of directorial skill. For example, one that stands out in my mind comes when the camera focuses on a radio reporting a possible murder, while the young, rich kids with whom George has struck up a friendship goof off in the water in the background.  There are also some great uses of dissolve editing, though the technique is somewhat overused.But there are many problems with the film, notably its pacing.  Much time is spent on George's love triangle with Alice and Angela, while the script races through the trial and George's ultimate fate, as if the screenwriter realized he only had two hours to tell his story when he'd already wasted an hour and a half on front-end material.  Rushing through the end blunts much of the story's original intent and power, as that is where the majority of moral questions arise.Also, the character Shelley Winters plays is so drab and mousy, that one doesn't understand why George would entangle himself with her in the first place.  But Clift does a great job with the lead role, delivering a performance of raw nerve.It befuddles me somewhat as to why this movie is quite so acclaimed.  I can only imagine that its reception has to do with cultural moods at the time it was released and that it just hasn't aged well.  It came out in 1951, a big year for literary adaptations (&quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; and &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; were both given big-screen treatments that year), and you only need to compare &quot;Sun&quot; to &quot;Streetcar&quot; to see how short it falls at capturing the essence of a ture literary classic.Grade: B-",3,Tragedy Turned to Melodrama,1073433600,"01 7, 2004",2004,3322,"['was', 'probably', 'inevitable', 'quot', 'American', 'Tragedy', 'quot', 'evolution', 'screen', 'would', 'become', 'more', 'doomed', 'love', 'affair', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'moral', 'ethical', 'dilemmas', 'really', 'form', 'foundation', 'Theodore', 'Dreiser', 'novel', 'doomed', 'love', 'bigger', 'sell', 'especially', 'when', 'have', 'romantic', 'Clift', 'Taylor', 'swooning', 'together', 'extreme', 'close-up.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'doing', 'book', 'movie', 'comparisons', 'figure', 'film', 'literature', 'are', 'two', 'different', 'art', 'forms', 'should', ""n't"", 'compare', 'rendering', 'story', 'anymore', 'would', 'compare', 'same', 'story', 'presented', 'painting', 'opposed', 'ballet', 'tried', 'take', 'film', 'own', 'merits', 'admittedly', 'difficult', 'do', 'watched', 'movie', 'same', 'day', 'finished', 'book', 'even', 'think', 'movie', 'short.Clift', 'plays', 'George', 'Eastman', 'poor', 'nephew', 'rich', 'socially', 'elite', 'family', 'small', 'New', 'York', 'state', 'factory', 'town', 'been', 'invited', 'uncle', 'come', 'work', 'Eastman', 'factory', 'giving', 'entre', 'world', 'luxury', 'always', 'been', 'grasp', 'due', 'family', 'humble', 'position', 'run', 'mission', 'preach', 'streets', 'George', 'up', 'love', 'affair', 'Alice', 'Tripp', 'Shelley', 'Winters', 'girl', 'who', 'factory', 'attentions', 'quickly', 'fade', 'when', 'becomes', 'interested', 'Angela', 'Vickers', 'member', 'rich', 'set', 'played', 'Liz', 'Taylor', 'Complications', 'ensue', 'George', 'situation', 'spiralling', 'drastically', 'control', 'ending', 'more', 'tragic', 'ever', 'thought', 'possible.George', 'Stevens', 'film', 'sure', 'hand', 'are', 'breathtaking', 'displays', 'directorial', 'skill', 'example', 'one', 'out', 'mind', 'when', 'camera', 'radio', 'reporting', 'possible', 'murder', 'young', 'rich', 'kids', 'whom', 'George', 'struck', 'up', 'friendship', 'goof', 'water', 'background', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'uses', 'dissolve', 'editing', 'technique', 'somewhat', 'overused.But', 'are', 'many', 'problems', 'film', 'notably', 'pacing', 'Much', 'time', 'spent', 'George', 'love', 'triangle', 'Alice', 'Angela', 'script', 'trial', 'George', 'ultimate', 'fate', 'screenwriter', 'realized', 'only', 'had', 'two', 'hours', 'tell', 'story', 'when', ""'d"", 'already', 'wasted', 'hour', 'half', 'front-end', 'material', 'Rushing', 'end', 'much', 'story', 'original', 'intent', 'power', 'where', 'majority', 'moral', 'questions', 'arise.Also', 'character', 'Shelley', 'Winters', 'so', 'drab', 'mousy', 'one', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'George', 'would', 'entangle', 'first', 'place', 'Clift', 'great', 'job', 'lead', 'role', 'delivering', 'performance', 'raw', 'nerve.It', 'befuddles', 'somewhat', 'why', 'movie', 'quite', 'so', 'acclaimed', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'reception', 'do', 'cultural', 'moods', 'time', 'was', 'released', 'just', ""n't"", 'aged', 'well', 'came', 'out', '1951', 'big', 'year', 'literary', 'adaptations', 'quot', 'Streetcar', 'Named', 'Desire', 'quot', 'quot', 'Death', 'Salesman', 'quot', 'were', 'given', 'big-screen', 'treatments', 'year', 'only', 'need', 'compare', 'quot', 'Sun', 'quot', 'quot', 'Streetcar', 'quot', 'see', 'how', 'short', 'capturing', 'essence', 'ture', 'literary', 'classic.Grade', 'B-']",N/A
217486,A1JCWK43MAGZIG,6300215644,"By Definition ""By Definition""","[5, 12]","With the viewing of this film, it has now become clear that Montgomery Clift is always cast on the horns of a painful moral dilemma, whatever movie he is in. The Heiress and From Here to Eternity are two other obvious  examples. He's an antihero in an uncertain moral environment. Or rather, he starts in a sympathetic role but then BLOWS it by making poor decisions.Clift's characters' perennial troubles are that they simply are not good at conversation. They lack the ability or the circumstances to express themselves.A Place in the Sun finds Clift as George Eastman again making poor life choices, and messing things up for himself big time. As in the Heiress, he has social and career aspirations which he pursues in a naive fashion, but in this picture he ends up being torn between two women, and the result is utter disaster.A Place in the Sun starts out OK, but becomes an unpleasant movie to watch and both my wife and I could not bear to finish it. Seriously. It could actually ruin one's evening.Once I could see where this movie was headed, I wanted it to end quickly. By 30 minutes in, you could see it was not looking good.  I kept looking at the clock hoping it would end mercifully at 70 minutes, 80 minutes, 90 minutes. But no, A Place in The Sun runs a full 122 minutes! Yikes!On top of the unbearably tragic story, the direction is not great. There are countless scenes where George Stevens could have gone in on the characters for closeups, but instead he chose to keep the camera locked in a long shot that shows very little of the character's feelings. The birthday scene in Alice's apartment is a prime example. She's crying and grieving and you can't even see her face for upwards of two minutes! On top of this the pacing is often morbidly slow, such as the scene with Shelley Winters and the doctor, played by Star Trek's Mr Atoz, Ian Wolfe.The film deals with difficult issues of sexuality and abortion in a time when such topics were very touchy, indeed. And in some sense, they still are.It is not clear how this movie won 6 Academy Awards, but certainly it's moral message is overpowering, and perhaps that's why it garnered such favor.I do like the supporting cast of this movie very much, including Raymond Burr and Paul Frees, but Elizabeth Taylor is the best feature of this movie.

217487,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,6300215644,Byron Kolln,"[6, 6]","Originally filmed in 1931, Theodore Dreiser's landmark novel ""An American Tragedy"" came back to the screen in 1951, directed by George Stevens under the new title of A PLACE IN THE SUN, with an inspired cast.  This moving romance captured the emotions of post-war audiences with it's unflinching, painful depiction of one man's struggle to achieve the American dream, and the fates which conspire against him.Poor, unassuming George Eastman (Montgomery Clift) leaves his strict, religious mother (Anne Revere) and heads for the big city to work in his rich uncle's bathing suit factory.  There, despite a rule which forbids relationships between employees, he falls into a dalliance with dowdy factory girl Alice Tripp (Academy Award-nominee Shelley Winters).  Despite Alice's eventual pregnancy, George doesn't see a lasting future with her; instead his affections lie with Angela Vickers (Elizabeth Taylor), the dazzling young debutante who offers George the social status and family approval he craves.  Still, Alice lingers in the wings, with a secret that will eventually need to be revealed.  Just how will George manage to negotiate his way through this delicate situation, and what tragedies will envelope the love triangle?...Montgomery Clift was and still is the perfect actor to play George (in the original Dreiser novel, the character's name was Clyde).  Elizabeth Taylor, in her first truly adult role away from her almer-mater studio MGM, glows as Angela, a character who might have become too vapid or uninteresting in the hands of a lesser actress.  Shelley Winters fought hard to win the role of Alice, and in doing so broke away from the sexpot blonde characters she had endured as a contract star for Universal-International.  For some great backstage tales about the making of A PLACE IN THE SUN, check out Shelley Winters' entertaining autobiography ""Shelley (Also Known as Shirley)"".Still as hard-hitting and heartbreaking today as when it was first released more than fifty years ago, A PLACE IN THE SUN deserves a proud place in your classic movie collection.

Clift is terrific in portraying the internal battle being raged within the soul of George Eastman.The marvelously directed scene by George Stevens of Clift and Winters in a rowboat on lonely Loon Lake where their fates will be decided, was chilling and a memorable piece of cinematic history.Only the knowledge that Clift was topped by the great Humphrey Bogart for the Best Actor honors in 1952 makes his omission for this award understandable.

I say that because the last third of the film featured an expectation of some dreaded act about to be committed, giving it a film noir feel.One thing for sure, whatever you label the movie: it's well-acted, well-directed and well-photographed. Regarding the latter, this really looks good on DVD. No surprise it's directed well since George Stevens was the director. His resume speaks for itself.Obviously Montgomery Clift and Elizabeth Taylor are the ""big names"" in this film, but I found Shelly Winters and the character she played to be the most intriguing. She wasn't really appealing yet one could certainly identify with her feelings of insecurity with Taylor as her competition. ""Liz"" was in in her prime, looks-wise, with an absolutely classic face.Anyway, watching the character studies of the antsy Winters and the troublesome Clift were interesting. Clift, as is the case with most of us, causes his own problems and things slowly unravel for him. The story is another example of what can happen when one tries to cover up the truth. It comes back to bite you, big-time!I really found it refreshing, however, to see Clift's attitude at the end.

It won the academy award for best editing the year it was made, and part of this is due to that specific sequence. But, beyond that, this scene really does typify the brillance of George Stevens. You will see nothing like this in any film not only of that period but even later. The only thing rivalling the emotion and truthful storytelling of this scene is to be found in Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" towards the end with the revolving kiss between Novak and Stewart. In both, it defines a depth of relationship that transcends the tawdry or lustful. Compare any film made today! In the extra features, Pakula gives a very good analysis of this key scene.Enough cannot be said about the direction and acting of this film, and the compassion by which George Stevens directs his actors. I watched, a very good film too, Woody Allen's ""Matchpoint"" in juxtaposition. Same story, young man on the make. But notice the difference in the moral compass of each character. Clift brings real sorrow and helplessness to the plight he has created, while J. Rhys Myers is cold and emotionless in his fatal choice of wealth and position over love and commitment.Indeed, Stevens never bends to the audience identification with the character's fateful circumstance, and let's him off easy as we all might hope. Directors like Stevens are as rare as they come in the film industry, and his moral vision (like his cohort Capra's) is inviolable.

The point is that the director George Stevens ADAPTED the story, converting it from a cynical observation about attainment of ""The American Dream"", measured in terms of social position and material success, to an epic love story between an ambitious young man, played intensely but wanly by Montgomery Clift, and a vibrant young Elizabeth Taylor as the wealthy girl of social distinction. The film only hints at the reasons WHY this man would want to leave his class roots so his motivation is not really compulsive. The story was based on a real life drama and Shelley Winters plays the drab young working class girl who Clift impregnates and drowns. In this version of the story, the drowning is accidental but with a clever moral twist at the end. The film is famous for its lighting, camera work and scene transitions but if you have seen the original directed by Joseph Von Sternberg, you will know that some of the techniques are not as original as many might think.The print of the film is only OK with regular popping but the soundtrack is not and often the actors' words are blurred, particularly as Clift and Winters have a tendency to mumble. The extras, however, are very interesting. As well as the original trailer, there is a documentary which includes interviews with Taylor, Winters, the director's son, George Stevens Jnr, and associate producer Ivan Moffat. The last 2 also provide a low key commentary. Combining these with another documentary in which 8 famous film makers speak about Stevens and the result is we learn a lot about the director's approach. In contrast to contemporaries such as Alfred Hitchcock, Stevens came to the set with no particular plan. Accordingly, he filmed endless angles of every scene and then constructed the film in the editing. His films often went over budget. Maybe this is why ""A Place in the Sun"" does have a ponderous indulgent feel. It is painstaking and detailed film making.",4,Overrated film but some very good extra features,1282521600,"08 23, 2010",2010,2087,"['enjoyment', 'Place', 'Sun', 'may', 'be', 'directly', 'related', 'know', 'book', 'was', 'based', 'even', 'original', 'film', '1931', 'point', 'director', 'George', 'Stevens', 'ADAPTED', 'story', 'converting', 'cynical', 'observation', 'attainment', 'American', 'Dream', 'measured', 'terms', 'social', 'position', 'material', 'success', 'epic', 'love', 'story', 'ambitious', 'young', 'man', 'played', 'intensely', 'wanly', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'vibrant', 'young', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'wealthy', 'girl', 'social', 'distinction', 'film', 'only', 'reasons', 'WHY', 'man', 'would', 'want', 'leave', 'class', 'roots', 'motivation', 'not', 'really', 'compulsive', 'story', 'was', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'drama', 'Shelley', 'Winters', 'drab', 'young', 'working', 'class', 'girl', 'who', 'Clift', 'impregnates', 'drowns', 'version', 'story', 'drowning', 'accidental', 'clever', 'moral', 'twist', 'end', 'film', 'famous', 'lighting', 'camera', 'work', 'scene', 'transitions', 'have', 'seen', 'original', 'directed', 'Joseph', 'Von', 'Sternberg', 'will', 'know', 'techniques', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'original', 'many', 'might', 'think.The', 'print', 'film', 'only', 'OK', 'regular', 'popping', 'soundtrack', 'not', 'often', 'actors', 'words', 'are', 'blurred', 'particularly', 'Clift', 'Winters', 'have', 'tendency', 'mumble', 'extras', 'however', 'are', 'very', 'interesting', 'As', 'well', 'original', 'trailer', 'documentary', 'interviews', 'Taylor', 'Winters', 'director', 'son', 'George', 'Stevens', 'Jnr', 'associate', 'producer', 'Ivan', 'Moffat', 'last', '2', 'also', 'provide', 'low', 'key', 'commentary', 'Combining', 'documentary', '8', 'famous', 'film', 'makers', 'speak', 'Stevens', 'result', 'learn', 'lot', 'director', 'approach', 'contrast', 'contemporaries', 'such', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Stevens', 'came', 'set', 'particular', 'plan', 'Accordingly', 'filmed', 'endless', 'angles', 'scene', 'then', 'constructed', 'film', 'editing', 'films', 'often', 'went', 'budget', 'Maybe', 'why', 'Place', 'Sun', 'have', 'ponderous', 'indulgent', 'feel', 'painstaking', 'detailed', 'film', 'making']",N/A
217496,A3A8P8IBH7L1WW,6300215644,Edward,"[0, 0]","This year is the 60th anniversary of ""A Place in the Sun"" director George Stevens' film adaptation of Theodore Dreiser's 1925 novel ""An American Tragedy"". This version of the story does not treat the plot as sacrosanct, changing the time period to the 1950s and changing the characters' names.So Clyde Griffiths in the novel becomes George Eastman, his poor sweetheart Roberta becomes Alice, and Sondra the society girl he falls in love with becomes Angela. Montgomery Clift, one of the most popular actors of the early Fifties, took the role of George. Unusually handsome (in her song ""Monotonous"" Eartha Kitt mourned the fact that she was ""shipwrecked and cast adrift/With a man who looked like Montgomery Clift"" yet was still bored), Clift seemed to use his good looks as a plea for his characters' failings. He usually played a tormented, often doomed soul; and you'll notice he never made a film comedy. He gave several good performances, but in my opinion he was never more effective than he is here. Angela is played by Elizabeth Taylor, probably the most beautiful celebrity of her generation. Beautiful yes, but was she a good actress? I think she was an instinctive actress, and her instincts were often good. Plus she was lucky to have smart directors such as Stevens and Vincente Minnelli. But she was never an intellectual actress like Ingrid Bergman or Deborah Kerr, which probably explains why she did almost no stage work. In this film she portrays pretty much what she was for real, a  favored girl eating up life like a plate of oysters. (Interesting point: Elizabeth Taylor came close to playing another Dreiser heroine, Carrie Meeber, but that part went to Jennifer Jones.)  In contrast to Angela is Shelley Winters' Alice, hopelessly dowdy and defeated. George has been warned not to have anything to do with the workplace females, and Alice is so  masochistically mousy one wonders why George pays any attention to her at all, particularly when the factory is filled with plenty of pretty girls -- including Laura Elliott, Bruno's victim in ""Strangers on a Train"". Stevens was a sensitive director with a strong sense of the ironic. For instance, notice in the scene where George first conceives the idea of drowning Alice his boarding-house room is decorated with a reproduction of Millais' ""Ophelia"". Beautifully photographed by William C Mellor in black-and-white with moody lighting and slow dissolves, ""A Place in the Sun"" is a perfect depiction of the American dream in eclipse.",5,Dark side of the sun,1297900800,"02 17, 2011",2011,2506,"['year', '60th', 'anniversary', 'Place', 'Sun', 'director', 'George', 'Stevens', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Theodore', 'Dreiser', '1925', 'novel', 'American', 'Tragedy', 'version', 'story', 'not', 'treat', 'plot', 'sacrosanct', 'changing', 'time', 'period', '1950s', 'changing', 'characters', 'names.So', 'Clyde', 'Griffiths', 'novel', 'becomes', 'George', 'Eastman', 'poor', 'sweetheart', 'Roberta', 'Alice', 'Sondra', 'society', 'girl', 'love', 'becomes', 'Angela', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'actors', 'early', 'Fifties', 'took', 'role', 'George', 'Unusually', 'handsome', 'song', 'Monotonous', 'Eartha', 'Kitt', 'mourned', 'fact', 'was', 'shipwrecked', 'cast', 'adrift/With', 'man', 'who', 'looked', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'yet', 'was', 'still', 'bored', 'Clift', 'seemed', 'use', 'good', 'looks', 'plea', 'characters', 'failings', 'usually', 'played', 'tormented', 'often', 'doomed', 'soul', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'never', 'made', 'film', 'comedy', 'gave', 'several', 'good', 'performances', 'opinion', 'was', 'never', 'more', 'effective', 'here', 'Angela', 'played', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'probably', 'most', 'beautiful', 'celebrity', 'generation', 'Beautiful', 'yes', 'was', 'good', 'actress', 'think', 'was', 'instinctive', 'actress', 'instincts', 'were', 'often', 'good', 'was', 'lucky', 'have', 'smart', 'directors', 'such', 'Stevens', 'Vincente', 'Minnelli', 'was', 'never', 'intellectual', 'actress', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'Deborah', 'Kerr', 'probably', 'why', 'did', 'almost', 'stage', 'work', 'film', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'was', 'real', 'favored', 'girl', 'eating', 'up', 'life', 'plate', 'oysters', 'Interesting', 'point', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'came', 'close', 'playing', 'Dreiser', 'heroine', 'Carrie', 'Meeber', 'part', 'went', 'Jennifer', 'Jones', 'contrast', 'Angela', 'Shelley', 'Winters', 'Alice', 'hopelessly', 'dowdy', 'defeated', 'George', 'been', 'warned', 'not', 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'workplace', 'females', 'Alice', 'so', 'masochistically', 'mousy', 'one', 'why', 'George', 'attention', 'particularly', 'when', 'factory', 'filled', 'plenty', 'pretty', 'girls', 'including', 'Laura', 'Elliott', 'Bruno', 'victim', 'Strangers', 'Train', 'Stevens', 'was', 'sensitive', 'director', 'strong', 'sense', 'ironic', 'instance', 'notice', 'scene', 'where', 'George', 'first', 'idea', 'drowning', 'Alice', 'boarding-house', 'room', 'decorated', 'reproduction', 'Millais', 'Ophelia', 'Beautifully', 'photographed', 'William', 'C', 'Mellor', 'black-and-white', 'moody', 'lighting', 'slow', 'dissolves', 'Place', 'Sun', 'perfect', 'depiction', 'American', 'dream', 'eclipse']",N/A
217497,A3QD6BRGQT6068,6300215644,Elizabeth J. Brown,"[0, 0]","&#34;A Place in the Sun&#34; was sort of the &#34;Titanic&#34; of the early 1950s. Only director George Stevens really believed it wouldn't be a fiasco. He cast two ridiculously attractive leads in a story that had everything: romance, sex and death, and the eternal pull of stories that pit class against class. The source material was Theodore Dreiser's &#34;An American Tragedy,&#34; a fictional account of a 1906 murder in the Adirondacks that obsessed Dreiser, took him 20 years to write and that he could not pare down to much less than 900 pages. The story had been successfully adapted into a play, and filmed in 1931 in a version that didn't much please Mr. Dreiser. George Stevens loved the story. He had his ideal cast and the look he wanted for the movie in his head, and while he had a great track record and a lot of clout, he still had to pitch the idea to Paramount twice. The payoff was big. &#34;A Place in the Sun&#34; won six Oscars, the most deserved of which arguably went to the screenwriters, who managed to cut Dreiser's story by about 80% yet still have it make sense.You don't have to be a Titanic buff in order to enjoy the fictional retelling starring Kate Winslet and Leo DiCaprio, and you don't have to be familiar with &#34;An American Tragedy&#34; in order to appreciate &#34;A Place in the Sun.&#34; Montgomery Clift is George Eastman, the young man with nice looks and manners but no education and no prospects, until a chance meeting with an uncle leads him to come to work in the old man's garment factory. George starts out on the low rung, and sets about immediately to break the company rule against mixing socially with the female employees. He begins sneaking around to see Alice (Shelley Winters), who is sort of sweet but really needy. My major complaint with the movie has always been that I do not find Alice to be a sympathetic character. She is shrill and manipulative. Yes, she is scared; and no, she does not deserve to be treated like garbage. George really is nasty to her, as he admits far too late. What has stood in the way of George and Alice's moving to another town, where she can have his baby and they can find jobs and become domesticated, is George's ambition. Never satisfied with being simply a good servant, it moved headlong to the terrible master phase, cutting down everything in its path like a scythe. Angela Vickers, the impossibly lovely debutante played by Elizabeth Taylor, knows none of this as she and George fall in love. She does not regard George's ambition as being any more ruthless than that of his Eastman cousins, who she knows quite well.Ultimately&#8212;and this is no spoiler&#8212;Alice drowns while rowing on the lake with George. Whether her death is homicide or a tragic, yet fortuitous accident is open to interpretation, except to the wacky DA played by Raymond Burr. It's in the last act of the movie, once Alice's body is found and George ultimately goes on trial, that it becomes obvious that the world to which George aspired existed for him only in a material sense. What money could buy was all that mattered. The kind of money and clout George yearned to have is used against him: his uncle plans to shell out $100K for his nephew's defense, but nothing if it appears George is guilty. Angela's father pulls strings to keep her name out of the trial. For her part, Angela is less craven and callous than many in her circle; she wasn't aware of George's double life, but she also believes that what they had was real, as silly as that sounds.The love scenes between Clift and Taylor, both of whom were just gorgeous, and who responded to each other so well on camera, are still just dreamy. The cinematography is like velvet. Franz Waxman's score and Edith Head's costumes are among the best work either ever did. &#34;A Place in the Sun&#34; is still a wonderful, if imperfect movie, with many memorable touches.",4,A great melodrama,1376179200,"08 11, 2013",2013,3912,"['34', 'Place', 'Sun', '34', 'was', 'sort', '34', 'Titanic', '34', 'early', '1950s', 'Only', 'director', 'George', 'Stevens', 'really', 'believed', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'fiasco', 'cast', 'two', 'ridiculously', 'attractive', 'leads', 'story', 'had', 'everything', 'romance', 'sex', 'death', 'eternal', 'pull', 'stories', 'pit', 'class', 'class', 'source', 'material', 'was', 'Theodore', 'Dreiser', '34', 'American', 'Tragedy', '34', 'fictional', 'account', '1906', 'murder', 'Adirondacks', 'obsessed', 'Dreiser', 'took', '20', 'years', 'write', 'could', 'not', 'pare', 'down', 'much', 'less', '900', 'pages', 'story', 'had', 'been', 'successfully', 'adapted', 'play', 'filmed', '1931', 'version', 'did', ""n't"", 'much', 'please', 'Mr.', 'Dreiser', 'George', 'Stevens', 'loved', 'story', 'had', 'ideal', 'cast', 'look', 'wanted', 'movie', 'head', 'had', 'great', 'track', 'record', 'lot', 'clout', 'still', 'had', 'pitch', 'idea', 'Paramount', 'twice', 'payoff', 'was', 'big', '34', 'Place', 'Sun', '34', 'won', 'six', 'Oscars', 'most', 'deserved', 'arguably', 'went', 'screenwriters', 'who', 'managed', 'cut', 'Dreiser', 'story', '80', '%', 'yet', 'still', 'have', 'make', 'sense.You', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'Titanic', 'buff', 'order', 'enjoy', 'fictional', 'retelling', 'starring', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Leo', 'DiCaprio', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'familiar', '34', 'American', 'Tragedy', '34', 'order', 'appreciate', '34', 'Place', 'Sun.', '34', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'George', 'Eastman', 'young', 'man', 'nice', 'looks', 'manners', 'education', 'prospects', 'chance', 'meeting', 'uncle', 'come', 'work', 'old', 'man', 'garment', 'factory', 'George', 'out', 'low', 'rung', 'sets', 'immediately', 'break', 'company', 'rule', 'mixing', 'socially', 'female', 'employees', 'sneaking', 'around', 'see', 'Alice', 'Shelley', 'Winters', 'who', 'sort', 'sweet', 'really', 'needy', 'major', 'complaint', 'movie', 'always', 'been', 'do', 'not', 'find', 'Alice', 'be', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'shrill', 'manipulative', 'Yes', 'scared', 'not', 'deserve', 'be', 'treated', 'garbage', 'George', 'really', 'nasty', 'far', 'too', 'late', 'What', 'stood', 'way', 'George', 'Alice', 'moving', 'town', 'where', 'can', 'have', 'baby', 'can', 'find', 'jobs', 'become', 'domesticated', 'George', 'ambition', 'Never', 'satisfied', 'being', 'simply', 'good', 'servant', 'moved', 'headlong', 'terrible', 'master', 'phase', 'cutting', 'down', 'everything', 'path', 'scythe', 'Angela', 'Vickers', 'impossibly', 'lovely', 'debutante', 'played', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'none', 'George', 'fall', 'love', 'not', 'regard', 'George', 'ambition', 'being', 'more', 'ruthless', 'Eastman', 'cousins', 'who', 'quite', 'well.Ultimately', '8212', 'spoiler', '8212', 'Alice', 'drowns', 'rowing', 'lake', 'George', 'Whether', 'death', 'homicide', 'tragic', 'yet', 'fortuitous', 'accident', 'open', 'interpretation', 'wacky', 'DA', 'played', 'Raymond', 'Burr', 'last', 'act', 'movie', 'once', 'Alice', 'body', 'found', 'George', 'ultimately', 'trial', 'obvious', 'world', 'George', 'aspired', 'existed', 'only', 'material', 'sense', 'What', 'money', 'could', 'buy', 'was', 'mattered', 'kind', 'money', 'clout', 'George', 'yearned', 'have', 'used', 'uncle', 'plans', 'shell', 'out', '100K', 'nephew', 'defense', 'nothing', 'George', 'guilty', 'Angela', 'father', 'strings', 'keep', 'name', 'trial', 'part', 'Angela', 'less', 'craven', 'callous', 'many', 'circle', 'was', ""n't"", 'aware', 'George', 'double', 'life', 'also', 'what', 'had', 'was', 'real', 'as', 'silly', 'love', 'scenes', 'Clift', 'Taylor', 'whom', 'were', 'just', 'gorgeous', 'who', 'responded', 'other', 'so', 'well', 'camera', 'are', 'still', 'just', 'dreamy', 'cinematography', 'velvet', 'Franz', 'Waxman', 'score', 'Edith', 'Head', 'costumes', 'are', 'best', 'work', 'either', 'ever', 'did', '34', 'Place', 'Sun', '34', 'still', 'wonderful', 'imperfect', 'movie', 'many', 'memorable', 'touches']",N/A

Montgomery Clift, Elizabeth Taylor, and Shelley Winters give fine performances, while the cinematography (especially during the trip to the lake) is superb. Best of all, the ending is not what you would expect in a romantic film like this (I won't spoil anything, but I will say that the ending beats most endings in recent romantic comedies/dramas).

Simply put,it is a poignant, extremely well acted tale of a young man desperate to rise in the world. When George Eastman, played by Montgmery Clift, first sees Elizabeth Taylor, that is what love at first sight is like. Montgomery Clift was a great actor and Elizabeth Taylor was the perfect high society girl. Shelley Winters, as the factory worker George takes up with before he gets to know Angela Vickers, Elizabeth's character, is not as bad as I thought her years ago. She loves George and almost forces him to marry her when she becomes pregnant. She also wants to rise in the world. There is nothing wrong with that. George does not know how to break up with her and the Shelley Winters character dies in a lake accident. The scene after George is convicted and sent to die is perfect. Angela goes to see him and tells him she'll love him for the rest of her life. I wonder what Angela's life was like after George's death. Did she recover enough emotionally and marry? Did she become a professional woman, like a doctor or a lawyer? Did she inherit her father's business and had nothing to do with love and men?

217504,A3IKBHODOTYYHM,6300215644,"fra7299 ""fra7299""","[0, 0]","Based on Theodore Dreiser's ""An American Tragedy"", ""A Place in the Sun"" tells the story of George Eastman and his ultimate downfall. One of the issues dealt with in the story is the idealized vision of the American Dream, or in this case, its failure. Larger questions posed are ""What makes one happy, and at what price?""  The beginning scene illustrates George's resolve for new beginnings, with him hitching a ride from Chicago to his uncle's place, with the hopes of finding success in new surroundings. George has difficulty fitting in with his uncle's uppity, rich circle, however, and they are quick to judge him and his ""poor, uneducated"" background. George, after being offered a menial job in the factory, is mesmerized when beauty Angela Vickers walks in. Angela, a socialite, hardly even notices George as she speaks with some of Charles Eastman's friends. While working in the factory, George meets one of the workers, Alice Tripp, a rather plain girl who has a modest rental for a home. George begins to see Alice, and eventually the two have a sexual encounter even though George knows that dating or seeing anyone who works at the plant is strictly forbidden (after all, he is an Eastman). Time goes on; George continues to see Alice and work. One day, however, George by his uncle to a party for him; this will be the start of something new as his uncle plans to promote him. At this party, George once again runs into Angela Vickers. Not fitting in with the crowd, George is off playing pool when she walks in. The two begin a conversation and seem to hit it off; George now begins to experience the conflict of two lives: the one with Angela and the one with Alice. Later learning that Alice is pregnant, George attempts to keep their affair a secret, but Alice puts pressure on him to marry. The film from here focuses on George's conflict. He has designs to make things with Angela work, at all costs. Ultimately, his decisions and motives put him in a situation that will end in tragic results.It's interesting to see contrasting titles to the same story--""A Place in the Sun"" has a far more positive connotation than ""An American Tragedy"". Perhaps ""A Place in the Sun"" is fitting because this is exactly what George longs for--a symbolic ""place in the sun"" where love is ideally attained: you get the girl of your dreams to love and live perfect moments with her. The scope of the American Dream is within George's grasp, and he doesn't want to mess things up. George, akin to a Shakespearean tragic hero, has good qualities, but his ultimate desire is faulty in that it is too perfect and idealized.  He must choose whether or not he must take action with his ""other"" life. He seems to waver between being the poor, uneducated boy from out of town, or in the ""in crowd"" with Angela. In the end, he lacks identity; he's no villain because there are sympathies within him, yet he's burdened by his conscience which tells him to do something amoral.The film's storyline might not be the first of its kind, but it doesn't have to be to make this a uniquely satisfying classic. Stellar performances abound in ""A Place in the Sun"", from Montgomery Clift (George Eastman) to Elizabeth Taylor (Angela Vickers) to Shelley Winters (Alice Tripp). Raymond Burr , in the role of lead prosecutor, has a powerful moments late in the film as he attempts to break down George on the stand.  The final moments of the courtroom are suspenseful and keep the audience on edge.Although a bit over romanticized at points, it's easy to see how this film resonates as one of the true classics, and why it took home six Academy Awards.",4,Classic Certified,1267660800,"03 4, 2010",2010,3632,"['Based', 'Theodore', 'Dreiser', 'American', 'Tragedy', 'Place', 'Sun', 'story', 'George', 'Eastman', 'ultimate', 'downfall', 'One', 'issues', 'dealt', 'story', 'idealized', 'vision', 'American', 'Dream', 'case', 'failure', 'Larger', 'questions', 'posed', 'are', 'What', 'one', 'happy', 'what', 'price', 'beginning', 'scene', 'George', 'resolve', 'new', 'beginnings', 'hitching', 'ride', 'Chicago', 'uncle', 'place', 'hopes', 'finding', 'success', 'new', 'surroundings', 'George', 'difficulty', 'fitting', 'uncle', 'uppity', 'rich', 'circle', 'however', 'are', 'quick', 'judge', 'poor', 'uneducated', 'background', 'George', 'being', 'offered', 'menial', 'job', 'factory', 'mesmerized', 'when', 'beauty', 'Angela', 'Vickers', 'walks', 'Angela', 'socialite', 'hardly', 'even', 'notices', 'George', 'Charles', 'Eastman', 'friends', 'working', 'factory', 'George', 'one', 'workers', 'Alice', 'Tripp', 'rather', 'plain', 'girl', 'who', 'modest', 'rental', 'home', 'George', 'see', 'Alice', 'eventually', 'two', 'have', 'sexual', 'encounter', 'even', 'George', 'dating', 'seeing', 'anyone', 'who', 'plant', 'strictly', 'forbidden', 'Eastman', 'Time', 'George', 'see', 'Alice', 'work', 'One', 'day', 'however', 'George', 'uncle', 'party', 'will', 'be', 'start', 'something', 'new', 'uncle', 'plans', 'promote', 'party', 'George', 'once', 'again', 'Angela', 'Vickers', 'Not', 'fitting', 'crowd', 'George', 'playing', 'pool', 'when', 'two', 'begin', 'conversation', 'seem', 'hit', 'off', 'George', 'now', 'experience', 'conflict', 'two', 'lives', 'one', 'Angela', 'one', 'Alice', 'Later', 'learning', 'Alice', 'pregnant', 'George', 'keep', 'affair', 'secret', 'Alice', 'pressure', 'marry', 'film', 'here', 'George', 'conflict', 'designs', 'make', 'things', 'Angela', 'work', 'costs', 'Ultimately', 'decisions', 'motives', 'put', 'situation', 'will', 'end', 'tragic', 'results.It', 'interesting', 'see', 'contrasting', 'titles', 'same', 'story', 'Place', 'Sun', 'far', 'more', 'positive', 'connotation', 'American', 'Tragedy', 'Perhaps', 'Place', 'Sun', 'fitting', 'exactly', 'what', 'George', 'symbolic', 'place', 'sun', 'where', 'love', 'ideally', 'attained', 'get', 'girl', 'dreams', 'love', 'live', 'perfect', 'moments', 'scope', 'American', 'Dream', 'George', 'grasp', ""n't"", 'want', 'mess', 'things', 'up', 'George', 'Shakespearean', 'tragic', 'hero', 'good', 'qualities', 'ultimate', 'desire', 'faulty', 'too', 'perfect', 'idealized', 'must', 'choose', 'not', 'must', 'take', 'action', 'other', 'life', 'waver', 'being', 'poor', 'uneducated', 'boy', 'town', 'crowd', 'Angela', 'end', 'identity', 'villain', 'are', 'sympathies', 'yet', 'burdened', 'conscience', 'do', 'something', 'amoral.The', 'film', 'storyline', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'first', 'kind', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'make', 'uniquely', 'satisfying', 'classic', 'Stellar', 'performances', 'abound', 'Place', 'Sun', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'George', 'Eastman', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'Angela', 'Vickers', 'Shelley', 'Winters', 'Alice', 'Tripp', 'Raymond', 'Burr', 'role', 'lead', 'prosecutor', 'powerful', 'moments', 'late', 'film', 'break', 'down', 'George', 'stand', 'final', 'moments', 'courtroom', 'are', 'suspenseful', 'keep', 'audience', 'bit', 'romanticized', 'points', 'easy', 'see', 'how', 'film', 'one', 'true', 'classics', 'why', 'took', 'home', 'six', 'Academy', 'Awards']",N/A
217505,A2C7BOQVFH1HLE,6300215644,Frederick Baptist,"[5, 5]","This movie was painful for me to watch; not that it was badly done in any way but in that it was so good and the performances of the cast so convincing that the original title of the play this is based upon: ""An American Tragedy"" is really a perfect way to describe this film.  A poor, ambitious young man just wants to do his best to climb up and succeed and tragically despite all the attempts by his benevolent uncle to help him achieve just that, he manages to screw everything up through a lack of discipline and common sense.With the advent of Roe v Wade in the 70s, the events shown here would probably never happen today and yet you find yourself really feeling sorry for Clift's character who seems doomed from the start to make the wrong decisions and to inevitably see his dreams come to a tragic end.  This film is very good and George Stevens does a lot of novel directing tricks here such as the extensive use of close-ups and the fade out to move from scene to scene.This DVD version is quite good despite not having been restored; the picture quality is not perfect and yet the original master must have been preserved pretty well as the imperfections are not too distracting.  The sound quality is in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround and is quite good.  If a Blu-Ray version is to be released anytime soon, they could take the opportunity to clean up the picture quality with a proper restoration job.The special features are decent as they include a documentary with interviews with many famous directors talking about George Stevens who directed this film and retrospective interviews with the cast and crew of the movie.  Montgomery Clift was brilliant here and it's tragic how he died so young at the age of 45 from a heart attack.  One wonders how far his career would have taken him had he lived on. This is one movie which absorbs you and is so gripping you don't even feel the 2 hour length which is a testament to a great movie.Although not a restored version, this DVD is value for money given the price and unless you want a perfect picture quality version for which you may have to wait for another release, this DVD version of the film should suffice for you.",4,"Painfully Touching, Difficult Viewing, Classic Film!",1209168000,"04 26, 2008",2008,2183,"['movie', 'was', 'painful', 'watch', 'not', 'was', 'badly', 'done', 'way', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'performances', 'cast', 'so', 'convincing', 'original', 'title', 'play', 'based', 'American', 'Tragedy', 'really', 'perfect', 'way', 'describe', 'film', 'poor', 'ambitious', 'young', 'man', 'just', 'do', 'best', 'climb', 'up', 'succeed', 'tragically', 'attempts', 'benevolent', 'uncle', 'help', 'achieve', 'just', 'screw', 'everything', 'up', 'lack', 'discipline', 'common', 'sense.With', 'advent', 'Roe', 'v', 'Wade', '70s', 'events', 'shown', 'here', 'would', 'probably', 'never', 'happen', 'today', 'yet', 'find', 'really', 'feeling', 'sorry', 'Clift', 'character', 'who', 'doomed', 'start', 'make', 'wrong', 'decisions', 'inevitably', 'see', 'dreams', 'come', 'tragic', 'end', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'George', 'Stevens', 'lot', 'novel', 'directing', 'tricks', 'here', 'such', 'extensive', 'use', 'close-ups', 'fade', 'move', 'scene', 'scene.This', 'DVD', 'version', 'quite', 'good', 'not', 'having', 'been', 'restored', 'picture', 'quality', 'not', 'perfect', 'yet', 'original', 'master', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'preserved', 'pretty', 'well', 'imperfections', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'distracting', 'sound', 'quality', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'Surround', 'quite', 'good', 'Blu-Ray', 'version', 'be', 'released', 'anytime', 'soon', 'could', 'take', 'opportunity', 'clean', 'up', 'picture', 'quality', 'proper', 'restoration', 'job.The', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'decent', 'include', 'documentary', 'interviews', 'many', 'famous', 'directors', 'talking', 'George', 'Stevens', 'who', 'directed', 'film', 'retrospective', 'interviews', 'cast', 'crew', 'movie', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'was', 'brilliant', 'here', 'tragic', 'how', 'died', 'so', 'young', 'age', '45', 'heart', 'attack', 'One', 'how', 'far', 'career', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'had', 'lived', 'one', 'movie', 'absorbs', 'so', 'gripping', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'feel', '2', 'hour', 'length', 'testament', 'great', 'movie.Although', 'not', 'restored', 'version', 'DVD', 'value', 'money', 'given', 'price', 'want', 'perfect', 'picture', 'quality', 'version', 'may', 'have', 'wait', 'release', 'DVD', 'version', 'film', 'should', 'suffice']",N/A
217506,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,6300215644,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[65, 67]","Theodore Drieser was among America's earliest realistic authors, and his massive 1925 AN AMERICAN TRAGEDY, loosely based on real events, was a best-selling shocker filled with premarital sex, abortion issues, and social failures.  The novel was filmed in 1931--and Drieser was so outraged that he successfully sued Paramount to force reshoots and a new edit.  The result did not please Drieser, Paramount, or the movie-going public, and when censorship began to rear its head both the novel and movie were quietly shelved.By the late 1940s, however, censorship began to relax, and A PLACE IN THE SUN was among the first films to take advantage of the fact.  Unlike the 1931 film, producers did not attempt to film the whole of the novel; they instead focused on the second half.  The result was singularly powerful.George Eastman (Montgomery Cliff) is the poor relation of a wealthy family--and when seeks aid from them he is given a menial job in the factory, where he becomes intimate with factory worker Alice (Shelly Winters.)  But when George is suddenly promoted he begins to enter the world of his dreams--and it includes glamorous socialite Angela Vickers (Elizabeth Taylor.)  And now only the commonplace and unexpectedly pregnant Alice stands between him and all that he has ever desired.The script veers toward excess more than once, but director George Stevens and his extraordinary cast carry the film to unexpectedly powerful effect.  Previously known as a sex-bomb, Shelly Winters fought hard for the role of Alice and with it gives the first in the series of truly brilliant performances for which she would become so well known.  Elizabeth Taylor was one of the leading beauties of the screen, and her acting chops had been in clear evidence for some time before A PLACE IN THE SUN went before the cameras, but it here that she first truly showed what she could do with serious drama; she is flawless.  And then there is Montgomery Cliff.Although Marlon Brando and James Dean made ""Method Acting"" a household term, Cliff was very much of the same school, and he broke new ground in film several years before either Brando or Dean made the screen.  And A PLACE IN THE SUN shows Cliff at his finest, offering a truly amazing, powerful performance as the highly-driven but morally weak George Eastman, stumbling over ever trip-wire society can place in his path.  It is a truly devastating performance, gut-wrenchingly painful in honesty, offered without a trace of artifice in evidence.As the film progresses the moral issues evolve in several very unexpected ways, most particularly as they reference degrees of guilt, premeditation, and at what point intent becomes the same as fact.

George Stevens has fashioned a memorable and stirring adaptation of the novel by Theodore Dreiser's &quot;An American  Tragedy.&quot; Montgomery Clift stands out as the poor and wretched nephew  of a wealthy businessman. He slowly starts to climb the ladder of success  when he sees the lovely Elizabeth Taylor, who was 19 at the time. However,  he has also become involved with the maidish Shelley Winters and their one  night together results in a pregnancy. With his future suddenly becoming  brighter and more promising, the bitter truth from Winters threatens to  bring him down and destroy him. However one cannot fool the way life works,  and it all comes back to seek revenge upon him for what he does to secure  his place in the sun of high society. Six Oscars went to this masterpiece  for its brilliant direction from Stevens, screenplay adaptation,  cinematography which looks creepy and then blossoming when appropriate,  Franz Waxman's moody music score, Edith Head's incredible costume designs  for Taylor, and film editing, which keeps the film moving and never letting  up interest. However audiences and critics were in an uproar in 1951 when  it lost Best Picture to a musical that year. This film's content was ahead  of its time in some aspects for it deals with pregnancy, lust, a one night  stand, and cheating your way up the ladder of success. There are few films  that can equal the powerful impact of emotion this film evokes for the  characters. You can't help but feel sorry for Winters when she becomes  victimized and lied to by Clift, thus leaving her to fend for herself while  he goes on in the carnival of a life of sheer luxury. The most terrifying  and pulse-pounding scene takes place on the lake, where tragedy and shock  occur. The photography adds tension and fear, you can sense that danger is  waiting somewhere. One of the greatest films ever and I highly recommend it  to anyone who is a genuine film buff of the classics and this film is an  eternal landmark in the world of movies.",5,An All-Time Classic,953164800,"03 16, 2000",2000,2118,"['top', '100', 'films', 'time', 'gem', 'early', 'fifties', 'solely', 'George', 'Stevens', 'fashioned', 'memorable', 'stirring', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'Theodore', 'Dreiser', 'quot', 'American', 'Tragedy.', 'quot', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'out', 'poor', 'wretched', 'nephew', 'wealthy', 'businessman', 'slowly', 'climb', 'ladder', 'success', 'when', 'lovely', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'who', 'was', '19', 'time', 'However', 'also', 'become', 'involved', 'maidish', 'Shelley', 'Winters', 'one', 'night', 'together', 'results', 'pregnancy', 'future', 'suddenly', 'becoming', 'brighter', 'more', 'promising', 'bitter', 'truth', 'Winters', 'threatens', 'bring', 'down', 'destroy', 'However', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'fool', 'way', 'life', 'works', 'back', 'seek', 'revenge', 'what', 'secure', 'place', 'sun', 'high', 'society', 'Six', 'Oscars', 'went', 'masterpiece', 'brilliant', 'direction', 'Stevens', 'screenplay', 'adaptation', 'cinematography', 'creepy', 'then', 'blossoming', 'when', 'appropriate', 'Franz', 'Waxman', 'moody', 'music', 'score', 'Edith', 'Head', 'incredible', 'costume', 'designs', 'Taylor', 'film', 'editing', 'film', 'moving', 'never', 'letting', 'up', 'interest', 'However', 'audiences', 'critics', 'were', 'uproar', '1951', 'when', 'lost', 'Best', 'Picture', 'musical', 'year', 'film', 'content', 'was', 'ahead', 'time', 'aspects', 'pregnancy', 'lust', 'one', 'night', 'stand', 'cheating', 'way', 'ladder', 'success', 'are', 'few', 'films', 'can', 'equal', 'powerful', 'impact', 'emotion', 'film', 'characters', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'sorry', 'Winters', 'when', 'victimized', 'lied', 'Clift', 'thus', 'leaving', 'fend', 'carnival', 'life', 'sheer', 'luxury', 'most', 'terrifying', 'pulse-pounding', 'scene', 'place', 'lake', 'where', 'tragedy', 'shock', 'occur', 'photography', 'tension', 'fear', 'can', 'sense', 'danger', 'waiting', 'somewhere', 'One', 'greatest', 'films', 'ever', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'genuine', 'film', 'buff', 'classics', 'film', 'eternal', 'landmark', 'world', 'movies']",N/A

Perhaps I was too young, plus I did not understand Montgomery Clift's acting style.  Subsequent viewings have made me realize the quality of this film.  Clift stars as the poor relation of an important family who begins to work his way up.  He first has a relationship with plain working girl Shelley Winters.  Then he meets the real love of his life, beautiful, wealthy Elizabeth Taylor.  From that point, things become very complicated for all concerned.  Clift was an actor that played everything deeply, and his performances are always painfully real, just like this one, in which you can feel the conflicts that tear him apart.  Winters is excellent in her tragic role, while Taylor, besides looking unbelievably beautiful, brings a lot of honesty to her character.  The chemistry between the Clift and Taylor is palpable, and their on screen kiss is one of the most memorable you will ever see.  Although there is a sense of doom that permeates the movie, the actors make every moment a great one.

217526,AYPS4RCXEFSJP,6300215644,K. Boullosa,"[2, 2]","This is the second filming of Theodore Drieser's 1925 novel, AN AMERICAN TRAGEDY, which was based on real events.  The earlier, 1931 film, faced too many problems to succeed and has faded from cinema history, but this later version stands as a magnificent example of the American cinema at its best, and is acknowledged as one of director George Stevens's finest achievements.  The movie focuses on the second half of Dreiser's long, complex novel, omitting much of the background about the main characters' family livrd and background, which are only glancingly referenced in Stevens's film.On a strictly technical level, it was in this film that Stevens pioneered the use of gigantic closeups, taking advantage of the extraordinary physical beauty of his two leading stars (Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Clift).  The closeups allowed Stevens to capture their emotional attachment at a range that nearly brings the viewer into their embraces.  The result is exceptionally powerful.The cast is, without exception, tremendous, with Shelley Winters winning a Best Actress Oscar nomination for her portrayal of Alice Tripp, the plain, obtuse, lonely assembly line worker (she lost to Vivien Leigh for her portrayal of Blanche in ""A Streetcar Named Desire"".  Winters, previously typed as a second-string dumb-blonde/cum sexpot, said later that she cried when she saw the first rushes and begged Stevens to give her a bit more makeup.  Stevens, however, replied that eventually Winters would thank him for leaving her to the glaring mercy of the lights, and she credits that judgment for helping her take home the Oscar.The young Elizabeth Taylor, once a child star and still struggling to establish herself as something more than a face, wanted this role (wealthy socialite Angela Vickers) badly to demonstrate her abilities.  She was also a very close personal friend of Clift's and their mutual empathy is evident in their work together here.  Clift is excellent as George Eastman, conveying Eastman's fierce but inchoate yearning for the golden life and opportunities that his distant cousin, Angela, represents.As the film opens, George, a poor relation of a wealthy family, arrives to seek their help in making his way in the world.  He is given a menial job in their factory and left very much alone - it is clear that while the family is willing to help him, they don't consider him quite on their social level.  He is, therefore, lonely and somewhat adrift, as well as bored at his dull job and angry at being placed there.  In the factory he meets, and begins half-heartedly dating, fellow assembly line worker Alice.  Alice recognizes in George exactly what George sees in Angela: higher quality - someone made of finer material - and perhaps a way out of a dead-end life. She allows George to seduce her early in their relationship in an attempt to attach him permanently.George, however, is already half-fixated on his lovely distant cousin, Angela - she appears in the society columns of the local papers, on highway billboards, and he has even seen her at the family's large house on the hill, where he first presented himself to ask for help.  By the time he seduces Alice, George is already determined to do something to improve his standing, and bring himself closer to Angela and her world of parties, pools, yachts, and hunting lodges.  George writes a report on improving the efficiency of the assembly line - the report is favorably received, George is promoted, and as a result, invited to attend a party of young people at the Big House.  When he arrives there, the social barriers between him and the other young people are still apparent and he is uncomfortable.  But he has managed to meet Angela in a social context that places them on a somewhat more equal footing, and she finds something very attractive in his brooding seriousness, so different from the callow youths around her.  A bond quickly begins to form, the couple begin to see each other in secret, and George begins to believe that all that he has dreamed of may, after all, be within his reach.That is, until Alice turns up pregnant.  By the time she finds out that she is pregnant, Alice has begun to realize that George's interest in her was momentary and that he is somehow connected to Angela, whose wealth and beauty Alice cannot hope to compete with.  Alice, after a failed attempt to explore the possibility of abortion with a country doctor, demands that George marry her, or she will reveal the situation to Angela and her family.  Over Labor Day Weekend, in the small town where Alice has gone to see the doctor, George promises to do so, but the town's municipal offices are closed for the holiday, giving him time to think.  He takes Alice boating on the lake in the twilight.  She sees his misery and tries to present their impending marriage in a more positive light, talking about how she is used to being poor and working hard, not realizing that she is driving George half-mad with references to the poverty and narrowed horizons that he has just seen his way out of - he begins to shout at her and Alice realizes, at last, that he hates her.  In her anger and emotional agitation, Alice stands up in the boat and falls overboard.  It is by now quite dark, and the viewer hears George calling her name over and over again - and eventually sees him fleeing the town, alone.  Alice's drowned corpse is found, and, eventually, George is arrested and tried for her murder.In the ensuing trial, the crucial issue is the power of intent to define actual guilt: did George honestly try but fail to rescue Alice - or did he let her to drown in order to free himself from unwelcome responsibilities and pursue a far more appealing future with Angela?In Dreiser's novel, the answer to this question is clearer than in Stevens' film.  Whether that shift was an appropriate artistic judgment, each person who sees the film must decide for himself.  The film's position works on its own terms, but purists may assert that changing Dreiser's perspective dilutes the novel's indictment of the corruption of venal cultural values.Be that as it may, the film is powerful and sad, very painful to watch in places, with great performances.  The questions it raises about intent and responsibility, and about cultural values, are not easily dismissed.On a less exalted plane, cultural historians may wish to note that the ballgown that Angela wears when George meets her socially at that party set fire to the imaginations of young women all over the U.S.  Copies of it appeared in stores from coast to coast, and may be seen on girls in old photos heading off to their high school proms.",5,First Class Americana,1201737600,"01 31, 2008",2008,6675,"['second', 'filming', 'Theodore', 'Drieser', '1925', 'novel', 'AN', 'AMERICAN', 'TRAGEDY',

But after seeing it, I was glad because color would have ruined its darkness and intensity. It is truly sin at it's highest height. A man kills so as to love another. I was shocked. And also to know that it was a true story made it all the more horrible. In 1908, a man killed his pregnant girlfriend to have his cake and eat it too. Thankfully, he died in the gas chamber. Maybe it should be shown regularly on TV so that we here in America can see what should happen to those who kill another human in cold blood. I know it was the right verdict even though at the time I thought he was innocent.At the end, when Angela comes to death row to say, ""goodbye"" and he says to her, ""now I know that I am guilty of most of what they said I did"". I was shocked again. I was for him to get off. Oh how awful! I wanted him to marry Angela Vickers. I was horrified at myself.

217534,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,6300215644,Linda Linguvic,"[104, 107]","I haven't read Theodore Dreiser's ""An American Tragedy"" on which this 1951 film is based, but I can see how the word ""tragedy"" is used in its classic sense - that of a character who meets disaster because of a tragic flaw.  So even though purists might see ""A Place in the Sun"" as a romanticized version of Dreiser's tale, I certainly found it serious enough for me.Directed by George Stevens, the film opens with Montgomery Clift thumbing a ride.  He's going to the town where his rich uncle owns a mill.  He's awkward among his affluent relatives and happy to get a job, any job.  And so even though he has to start at the bottom, packing bathing suits into boxes, he's aware of his future opportunities.  Shelly Winters is cast as a factory girl he starts romancing.  But then, his fortunes suddenly turn, he's invited to more and more upscale social events, and he falls in love with Elizabeth Taylor.  The plot thickens as Shelly Winters announces her pregnancy and Montgomery Cliff finds himself trapped. The consequences are horrific as we watch his dreams all crash down around him.I was captured by the story right from the beginning in a screenplay that kept the tension mounting and never let up.  I identified with Montgomery cliff and found myself sympathic to his plight. He plays a complex character and has a lot of moral choices to make. He sweats, he shakes, he cringes, his eyes fill with tears.  Certainly, he was one of the finest actors of his time and his performance is magnificent.  Elizabeth Taylor was just 17 years old then and sure was a beauty.  As she explains in an interview as part of the special features on the DVD, this was her first serious role. ""Before that,"" she says jokingly, ""all my leading men were either dogs or horses.""  She also tells us that Montgomery Cliff, with whom she maintained a long friendship with until his death at the age of 45, was her first movie kiss.  ""I had only just had my first 'real' off-screen kiss just two weeks before,"" she says.  Shelly Winters talks about her role too.  She wanted the role of the factory girl badly.  However, at the time, she was typecast as a glamour queen.  And so she dressed in an extremely plain way when she went for her screen test. She sat demurely in the office and George Stevens didn't even recognize her.I loved this film.  It had everything.  Romance.  High drama. Great acting. Moral choices.

217535,A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,6300215644,"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t...","[1, 1]","There's a number of emotions with A Place in the Sun. Clearly Clift is doing something wrong here, stringing along a poor, pregnant woman while also falling deeply in love with Taylor. But both women adore him. He never meant to do any harm. He has done his best, all his life, to do what's right and to care for his family. Somehow things just go horribly awry for him and even in the depths of his despair he tries to do the right thing.It's amazing that Taylor was only 17 when she played this role, and that this, her first on-screen kiss, came only a few weeks after her first in-real-life kiss. Winters, up until now cast as a bombshell, desperately wanted the ""plain Jane"" role to show she had merit within her as well as without. And Clift shows his range of acting ability as he plays his desperation, his adoration, and his humanity.So many one-night decisions we all make in life have ramifications that follow us for the rest of our years. How do we handle them? How do we react to pressures? It was just one night that Clift crossed over the edge into passion, and it was going to affect every step he took from that day forward. In 1951 the topic of abortion and unmarried women carried a lot of weight. Winters has to lie to the doctor about her state, and she feels the shame of it. Look at how the workers in the factory refer to the ""girls"" and how the ""supervisors"" (men, of course) are not allowed to fraternize with them.And on the other hand, there are some amazingly forward-thinking issues here. One of my favorite films is 12 Angry Men which has, of course, 12 men on a jury. But here there are women on the jury and it's considered normal and proper. Taylor, a woman, is off at college, something that the women in American Grafitti (set in 1962) weren't even considering. Now, that being said, when Taylor is at college the lecture is incredibly insipid, about how the silly little girls in class probably have ""harshly adopted opinions"" of infancy that won't survive the real world.And also, Clift is made to ""solemnly swear before God"" that he is finally telling the truth, as if before that he would readily lie.But, unlike almost every other movie made, A Place in the Sun gets great kudos for actually having a conversation between women. It is stunning how many movies feature women but they only exist to talk to men and support them. Vast numbers of movies never have two women talk to each other - they only are there to respond to men and adore them. In A Place in the Sun, it may be short, but there is an actual conversation between Taylor and Clift's aunt, where Taylor is rhapsodizing about her new summer home she's building. It is such a small thing, but so amazing! It is sad that to even see a short conversation between women is so rare that it needs to be commented on. And it's sad, too, that it can happen in 1951 but rarely happens even in modern day films.The movie shows us both how far we have come - and still how far we have to go.Highly recommended.

217537,A79U01AE98EV8,6300215644,MACLEAR,"[2, 2]","The movie begins with Clift as George Eastman thumbing a ride.  As he does so he spies a billbord idealizing the ""Eastman Girl.""  He looks away and Liz Taylor (Angela Vickers) passes him speeding along the highway.  Such visions have passed this man by before.  She IS the image, the idealization of all his dreams.  The first time George enters the Eastman mansion he is woefully underdressed; the second time he sports a necktie at a party in which all the men are wearing bowties; the third time he finally fits in, at least sartorially.  Shelley Winters demonstrates no vanity in her role as the frumpy Alice - before taking on this role she had always played glamourous women.  When George finally convinces her to allow him to spend the night the camera focuses on the radio sitting in the window, out of which we see his car.  The evening sky is wiped to dawn as George is seen leavinf the apartment.  A bit of directorial genius - saying much without saying anything.  The film makes its audience compicit in the murder(?) of Alice Tripp - we sympathize with George.  He made a mistake - in the words of T.S. Eliot, ""The awful daring of a moment's surrender which an age of prudence could never retract"" (a paraphrase).It is difficult to feel compassion towards Alice.  Why does she insist on marrying a man she knows full well does not reciprocate that love?  It is not enough to answer, ""Well, she's pregnant and the baby needs a father.""  In those days many women took the baby to term and then gave it up for adoption.  This is not to say that George did not use Alice for sexual gratification; nor is it an apology for his not trying to save her from drowning.  These are reprehensible acts surely.  Yet the way George is pictured here it is not so easy to condemn him.  Should George be shackled for life with a woman because of an indiscretion?  Well, it raises questions about the times (the early 50's) when this is precisely what happened to many men.  What would the child's life be like, being reared in a household without love, filled with resentment, and filled with despair and regret?  The film provides no easy answers - which is one of the reasons it is a masterpiece.  It is not a dictatic tract.  There is no tidy moral plastered on to the end of the film.  A moarl would diminish the tragic nature of the plot.And what of women who watch this film?  How might they perceive Alice if not as a woman who insists on a relationship with a man she ""loves"" at all costs to her dignity and to her integrity?  Is it love she feels for George?  One can make a case that it is not.  When one loves another one wishes the best for that other - at least ideally if not always in practice.  In the Dreiser novel on which the movie is based, the Angela Vickers character is colder that she is portrayed here.  She does not visit the George Eastman character in prison.  Liz Taylor's Angela is a feminine ideal - beautiful, sensitive, compassionate, loving, steadfastly loyal.  She turns in a magnificent performance.  As George, Montgomery Clift is in top form.  He must engage the audience's sympathy while using Alice Tripp as a sexual release, while avoiding his responsibilities (if his responsibilities they be), while seeming to be cheerful directly after Alice's death (this cheer modified by his sorrow and despair - having come so close to his ideal only to have it wrenched away).  Of course, as Angela is George's ideal, so is George Alice's.  The difference is that in one case the love is mutual and nurturing, in the other it is desperate and toxic.The directing is seamless.  Mr. Stevens' demonstrates his greatness as a director with each and every scene, from that magical erotic kiss between George and Angela (""Angel""), to the radio on the dock reporting Alice's disappearance while George and his newfound wealthy friends carry on in a speedboat (the water imagery here is ingenious), from Angela's fainting before a wall sized mirror to our viewing the capsized boat from a far distance (having to conjecture exactly what transpires after the boat capsizes).This is certainly one of the greatest films ever made and repays re-viewing.",5,a masterpiece,1371859200,"06 22, 2013",2013,4171,"['movie', 'Clift', 'George', 'Eastman', 'thumbing', 'ride', 'so', 'billbord', 'idealizing', 'Eastman', 'Girl', 'away', 'Liz', 'Taylor', 'Angela', 'Vickers', 'speeding', 'highway', 'Such', 'visions', 'have', 'passed', 'man', 'image', 'idealization', 'dreams', 'first', 'time', 'George', 'Eastman', 'mansion', 'woefully', 'underdressed', 'second', 'time', 'sports', 'necktie', 'party', 'men', 'are', 'wearing', 'bowties', 'third', 'time', 'finally', 'least', 'sartorially', 'Shelley', 'Winters', 'vanity', 'role', 'frumpy', 'Alice', 'taking', 'role', 'had', 'always', 'played', 'glamourous', 'women', 'When', 'George', 'finally', 'allow', 'spend', 'night', 'camera', 'radio', 'sitting', 'window', 'see', 'car', 'evening', 'sky', 'wiped', 'dawn', 'George', 'seen', 'apartment', 'bit', 'directorial', 'genius', 'saying', 'much', 'saying', 'anything', 'film', 'audience', 'compicit', 'murder', 'Alice', 'Tripp', 'sympathize', 'George', 'made', 'mistake', 'words', 'T.S', 'Eliot', 'awful', 'daring', 'moment', 'surrender', 'age', 'prudence', 'could', 'never', 'retract', 'paraphrase', '.It', 'difficult', 'feel', 'compassion', 'Alice', 'Why', 'insist', 'marrying', 'man', 'full', 'well', 'not', 'reciprocate', 'love', 'not', 'enough', 'answer', 'Well', 'pregnant', 'baby', 'father', 'days', 'many', 'women', 'took', 'baby', 'term', 'then', 'gave', 'up', 'adoption', 'not', 'say', 'George', 'did', 'not', 'use', 'Alice', 'sexual', 'gratification', 'apology', 'not', 'trying', 'save', 'drowning', 'are', 'reprehensible', 'acts', 'surely', 'way', 'George', 'pictured', 'here', 'not', 'so', 'easy', 'condemn', 'Should', 'George', 'be', 'shackled', 'life', 'woman', 'indiscretion', 'Well', 'questions', 'times', 'early', '50', 'when', 'precisely', 'what', 'happened', 'many', 'men', 'What', 'would', 'child', 'life', 'be', 'being', 'reared', 'household', 'love', 'filled', 'resentment', 'filled', 'despair', 'regret', 'film', 'easy', 'answers', 'one', 'reasons', 'masterpiece', 'not', 'dictatic', 'tract', 'tidy', 'moral', 'plastered', 'end', 'film', 'moarl', 'would', 'diminish', 'tragic', 'nature', 'plot.And', 'what', 'women', 'who', 'watch', 'film', 'How', 'might', 'perceive', 'Alice', 'not', 'woman', 'who', 'relationship', 'man', 'loves', 'costs', 'dignity', 'integrity', 'George', 'One', 'can', 'make', 'case', 'not', 'When', 'one', 'one', 'best', 'other', 'least', 'ideally', 'not', 'always', 'practice', 'Dreiser', 'novel', 'movie', 'based', 'Angela', 'Vickers', 'character', 'colder', 'portrayed', 'here', 'not', 'visit', 'George', 'Eastman', 'character', 'prison', 'Liz', 'Taylor', 'Angela', 'feminine', 'ideal', 'beautiful', 'sensitive', 'compassionate', 'loving', 'steadfastly', 'loyal', 'magnificent', 'performance', 'George', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'top', 'form', 'must', 'engage', 'audience', 'sympathy', 'using', 'Alice', 'Tripp', 'sexual', 'release', 'avoiding', 'responsibilities', 'responsibilities', 'be', 'seeming', 'be', 'cheerful', 'directly', 'Alice', 'death', 'cheer', 'modified', 'sorrow', 'despair', 'having', 'come', 'so', 'close', 'ideal', 'only', 'have', 'wrenched', 'away', 'course', 'Angela', 'George', 'ideal', 'so', 'George', 'Alice', 'difference', 'one', 'case', 'love', 'mutual', 'nurturing', 'other', 'desperate', 'toxic.The', 'directing', 'seamless', 'Mr.', 'Stevens', 'greatness', 'director', 'scene', 'magical', 'erotic', 'kiss', 'George', 'Angela', 'Angel', 'radio', 'dock', 'reporting', 'Alice', 'disappearance', 'George', 'newfound', 'wealthy', 'friends', 'carry', 'speedboat', 'water', 'imagery', 'here', 'ingenious', 'Angela', 'fainting', 'wall', 'sized', 'mirror', 'viewing', 'capsized', 'boat', 'far', 'distance', 'having', 'conjecture', 'exactly', 'what', 'boat', 'capsizes', '.This', 'certainly', 'one', 'greatest', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'repays', 're-viewing']",N/A

Is it because they are works of art or is it because we want to be entertained? In short, both reasons. But the art of filmmaking has more purposes than merely entertaining you. It can show what history was like, illuminate a certain aspect of life, raise serious controversial issues or teach a moral lesson to society. However most people (especially my family) go to the theaters to be entertained--to be cheered up by an escape from reality--so when they're faced with a movie that doesn't even try to be entertaining they are immediately repulsed by it.George Stevens' A Place in the Sun falls under this category. It's a movie I hope no one will ever find entertaining. I had seen it two and half years ago and felt so dried out and desolate at the end that I threw it away. Even so, the story just burned into my mind and wouldn't go away. I often wondered why. So I picked it up at the library yesterday just to make sure I wasn't in a bad mood last time I saw it. I can now, truly say it is one of the most depressing but powerfully made films I have ever seen. I suppose it is one of those sorts of films that are more rewarding after repeating viewings. Sure, it is very clever at times and extremely well-written, directed and acted. But I guess what is so sad about it is that it is just so HONEST and REALISTIC about the pathetic nature, sexual immaturity of womanizers and the consequences of adultery and lies. A man does not respect a woman he can do the whole nine yards with. And when you do something terribly wrong it is always better to take your responsibilities on the chin and try to make amends instead of sweeping it under the rug over and over to try to cover up until you are finally trapped--a slave to your sin. And even though this movie does not show how salvation and forgiveness in Christ (I know most people are not Christians so you'll probably disagree with me on this. Please don't slam me.) can save all it does show that in the presence of superficiality and selfishness you can get a lot of bruised, troubled and confused people.I usually find George Stevens a rather dull and tepid director (especially his later films like Giant and Greatest Story Ever Told) but here he really brings out tight, crisp, pitch perfect performances from everyone and uses some terrific camera angles (a wide variety of extreme close-ups, extreme off distance shots and numerous in between shots) that actually rival Citizen Kane and On the Waterfront. Not one minute or line is wasted and there is plenty of fear and suspense leading up to the climaxes--that boat scene with the close ups of George as Alice is talking to him will NEVER leave my mind. EVER.I notice one of the two star reviewers complain about seeing only Alice's back through a window in a corner as she tells George she's pregnant but I think that is actually a sign of GREAT direction because this is something we as the audience are NOT supposed to see. In other words, we are spying on Alice through the window like a fly on the wall, and only we and the two adulterers know the secret.Montgomery Clift gives a knockout great performance as George Eastman and shows that there is much more substance in his acting abilities beyond his clothing magazine model looks. He avoids all broad, grand, melodramatic strokes that were the norm during the 40's and 50's and digs his character into a wonderful network of subtle facial expressions.My favorite parts are:1. The close up of his face in his apartment as the radio announcer talks about how dangerous the river is. The things he does with his eyes are amazing.2. When he's in his uncle's office at the beginning waiting for him to come. He sits in the chair behind the desk and swings it around a bit. We get a long distance shot of the huge office room. This is obviously how George sees himself in his dream world--being the head of a big business one day.3. When he comes back to Angela's house after the boat accident. One of her friends says ""Hey George! Where have been? What took you so long? Do you have another woman stashed somewhere?"" And George gives a halfhearted smile and forced laugh.4. When Angela's friends are cramming themselves into her skiing boat. One of the men grabs his girlfriend and throws her screaming overboard as a joke. Another close up of George's face. He looks like someone just punched him in the stomach.5. Angela' friends discussing the murder mystery on the news. One of the men say ""He just grabbed her and chucked her overboard like this.' And tosses his girlfriend over into a bush to illustrate. George leaves immediately because he can't take it anymore. Even though he is a sick and twisted man he is not so evil yet that he has no feelings of guilt or remorse for his actions.6. The prosecuting attorney (played with great gusto and intensity by Raymond Burr) `grilling' George in the trial. George looks like he's summoning all his strength to keep from crying.The two women, Shelley Winters and Elizabeth Taylor fit their roles perfectly. Their characters are as opposite as the two poles. One is shy, quiet, timid, plain and ignorant and the other is open, bubbly, sweet-natured, elegant, refined and charismatic.The cinematography and shot composition is amazing. It shows plenty of spacious shots of the city and the wildlife park and looks a lot like the Appalachian Mountains in Virginia and North Carolina or Acadia, Maine. Franz Waxman's music is rich, lush and schmaltzy. The sets and costumes are sumptuous.As you grow older, marry and have kids, you can try to sugarcoat life for them by providing them only movies and books with happy endings to create the illusion that life is just a bowl of cherries but that will not change the fact that there ARE consequences to bad decisions like George Eastman's and if watching A Place in the Sun has reminded you of the fact that it is best not to be swayed by your heart's desires because your heart CAN be deceitful then the movie has accomplished a far greater purpose than merely entertaining you--it has given you something to take on your journey.If you're looking for entertainment, don't watch A Place in the Sun but if you're looking for a great movie that upholds a moral truth to society and you don't mind the absence of a final note of hope and redemption than look no further than A Place in the Sun.Five Stars?

217541,ATZONTF6SUZEP,6300215644,Matthew Patton,"[18, 26]","Theodore Dreiser has never been one of my favorite writers, and his novel AN AMERICAN TRAGEDY, although rooted in fact, always felt too pat and mechanical, but at least the original never stacked the deck as badly as this lumbering, self-important film version does.The heartbreak of the original is that the factory girl that the main character kills in an attempt to achieve his social ambitions is at least as charming, perhaps more so, than the rich girl he covets as his stepping stone to The Good Life.  And in Joseph von Sternberg's early 30's film of the book, that girl was played by the radiant Sylvia Sydney.  The theorem of the story, of course, is that having to be married to her while only making a factory worker's salary would be such a grind and a misery that the pair would be miserable and hate one another in very short order.  Well, maybe the greedy, ambitious quisling at the center of Dreiser's novel, but most men with any common sense would rather spend life in a cold-water walk-up with Sylvia Sydney than life in a mansion with any real-life heiress . . .And the same would probably be true if Shelley Winters were allowed to be her actual, ebulliant self in the same role.  But George Stevens, who directed this version, wanted a shrill, drab harpie who would have driven men away even if she had just inherited several million dollars.  The rich girl, on the other hand, is played by Elizabeth Taylor at her loveliest and most luminous.  This is not a fair fight.And the film cheats in other ways--the protagonist is now played by Montgomery Clift at the height of his soulful handsomeness, and although he could have played his character as cold, weak, and self-absorbed (if you doubt this, check out his performance as Morris Townsend in THE HEIRESS, where he brings the chill of Henry James' novel WASHINGTON SQUARE to the tidied-up proceedings), Stevens and his screenwriters, Michael Wilson and Harry Brown, were apparently having none of this--George Eastman is now a doomed romantic hero, and so his murder of Winters becomes an accident, even though he did mean to kill her but chickened out on it.  And although he and Taylor did achieve a marvellous sort of rapport at times (William Mellor's soft-focus photography didn't hurt), it makes what should be a much more ambiguous relationship into the stuff of adolescent daydreams.  And whatever the faults of the original material, it was much more of a nightmare . . .",2,"Very Dreamy, Very Empty",1149897600,"06 10, 2006",2006,2457,"['Theodore', 'Dreiser', 'never', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'writers', 'novel', 'AN', 'AMERICAN', 'TRAGEDY', 'rooted', 'fact', 'always', 'felt', 'too', 'pat', 'mechanical', 'least', 'original', 'never', 'stacked', 'deck', 'as', 'badly', 'lumbering', 'self-important', 'film', 'version', 'does.The', 'heartbreak', 'original', 'factory', 'girl', 'main', 'character', 'kills', 'attempt', 'achieve', 'social', 'ambitions', 'least', 'charming', 'perhaps', 'more', 'so', 'rich', 'girl', 'stepping', 'stone', 'Good', 'Life', 'Joseph', 'von', 'Sternberg', 'early', '30', 'film', 'book', 'girl', 'was', 'played', 'radiant', 'Sylvia', 'Sydney', 'theorem', 'story', 'course', 'having', 'be', 'married', 'only', 'making', 'factory', 'worker', 'salary', 'would', 'be', 'such', 'grind', 'misery', 'pair', 'would', 'be', 'miserable', 'hate', 'one', 'very', 'short', 'order', 'Well', 'maybe', 'greedy', 'ambitious', 'quisling', 'center', 'Dreiser', 'novel', 'most', 'men', 'common', 'sense', 'would', 'rather', 'spend', 'life', 'cold-water', 'walk-up', 'Sylvia', 'Sydney', 'life', 'mansion', 'real-life', 'heiress', 'same', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'true', 'Shelley', 'Winters', 'were', 'allowed', 'be', 'actual', 'ebulliant', 'self', 'same', 'role', 'George', 'Stevens', 'who', 'directed', 'version', 'wanted', 'shrill', 'drab', 'harpie', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'driven', 'men', 'away', 'even', 'had', 'just', 'inherited', 'several', 'million', 'dollars', 'rich', 'girl', 'other', 'hand', 'played', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'loveliest', 'most', 'luminous', 'not', 'fair', 'fight.And', 'film', 'cheats', 'other', 'ways', 'protagonist', 'now', 'played', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'height', 'soulful', 'handsomeness', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'character', 'cold', 'weak', 'self-absorbed', 'doubt', 'check', 'out', 'performance', 'Morris', 'Townsend', 'THE', 'HEIRESS', 'where', 'chill', 'Henry', 'James', 'novel', 'WASHINGTON', 'SQUARE', 'tidied-up', 'proceedings', 'Stevens', 'screenwriters', 'Michael', 'Wilson', 'Harry', 'Brown', 'were', 'apparently', 'having', 'none', 'George', 'Eastman', 'now', 'doomed', 'romantic', 'hero', 'so', 'murder', 'Winters', 'accident', 'even', 'did', 'mean', 'kill', 'chickened', 'out', 'Taylor', 'did', 'achieve', 'marvellous', 'sort', 'rapport', 'times', 'William', 'Mellor', 'soft-focus', 'photography', 'did', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'ambiguous', 'relationship', 'stuff', 'adolescent', 'daydreams', 'whatever', 'faults', 'original', 'material', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'nightmare']",N/A

The 3 lovers are Montgomery Clift, Shelley Winters and a stunning Elizabeth Taylor.  Liz was really this young once! The leads carry the PS; the supporting cast is all but invisible. A struggling Monty meets nice girl/ plain Jane SW at work.  Then Monty is introduced to nice girl/rich and glamorous Liz.  The affection twixt Monty and LT that existed off the screen is patently plain in PS.  Monty is set to dump SW when a slight complication develops: She's pregnant!  Monty is with Liz and family at a posh lakeside resort when SW shows up with bag and baggage.  The contrast between the two leading ladies is stark and sad. Monty is in a vice between a beautiful rich woman and an unadorned pregnant one.  The plot thickens! This reviewer hates to divulge endings, but suffice it to say that there is a fateful boat ride. One of the young ladies meets her demise.  This reviewer lowered his rating because PS' fuzzy windup was a letdown! Perhaps the producers wanted to keep the run time under two hours, but PS is a rare film that might have benefited from being longer!  The Academy Awards saw it otherwise, bestowing Oscars for Best Director, Screenplay, Cinematography, Costume Design, Film Editing and Music. Monty, Shelley and the movie itself were also nominated. The final word from this source is that PS is above average, interesting and worth watching, especially for those unfamiliar with a young Liz Taylor.  But all those accolades and Oscars/near Oscars?

In addition to Taylor, the film stars Montgomery Clift as George Eastman, the nephew of a high roller who makes women's clothing.  Clift is about the only other person at the time that could compete with Taylor in the looks department.  They are perfect together in the movie as very convincing lovers.  Angela Vickers also comes from a privileged family, but is smitten by George's unpolished edge.  He had been brought up by religious do-gooders and is looking for another profession.When he starts out in his uncle's plant, George has a brief relationship with one of the workers played by Oscar nominee, Shelly Winters.  This misadventure leads to an unwanted pregnancy.  Alice (Winters) wants to get married, but all George can think about is Angela and his potential fortunes far away from Alice.  When Alice demands he leave a party at Angela's parent's house, George decides to take her for a boat ride and drown her.  He changes his mind but not before she accidentally capsizes the boat and drowns anyway.  He is ultimately found guilty and the film fades out as he walks to the electric chair.Much of the film is arousing melodrama, but there is no escaping the good performances.  Taylor is ravishing at this point in her career.  It's hard to take your eyes off her.  Director George Stevens focuses the camera several times for extreme close ups of Taylor and Clift which shout out movie star!  The final act consists of the trial.  Perry Mason (Raymond Burr) himself plays the D.A. and wins his case on hyperbole alone.  If he had been poor George's attorney he would have gotten him off.  Hell, I could have gotten him off.

Wealthy Uncle Eastman invites George, who is distantly located with his mother, to come to town-offering to find him a place in the business.George arrives but feels out of place with his high society relatives and their well-to-do friends.  There is a clear class distinction in this town.  For example, the relatives wonder aloud what to do about him socially.  And there's a scene at the worksite where a large sign on a door says something like:&quot;Factory Employees are Forbidden beyond this Point&quot;George begins working in the factory to learn the business.  He is warned by his cousin to stay away from the girls and always be conscious that he's an Eastman.  But George becomes attracted to one of his co-workers, Alice (Shelly Winters).  George woos her and eventually the relationship becomes intimate.Meanwhile, Uncle gives George encouragement, looking to promote him upstairs.  Also, an extremely attractive woman (Elizabeth Taylor) from the upper crust takes note of George at a socialite party.  He is totally smitten.George leaves the party finally visiting Alice late in the evening where she's been waiting all alone to celebrate his birthday. She tells him: &quot;Maybe you don't want to see me so much anymore.  Maybe you don't want to see me at all.&quot;Their lives soon become more complex.  Alice tells George she's in trouble.  In a memorable scene, Alice visits a doctor while George waits outside.  The doctor will only offer advice, not procedure.George sees Liz Taylor again. He's in love with her, and she with him.  But Alice, whose options are very limited in 1950's America asserts her rights: ""You gotta marry me, family or no family"" (meaning: no matter what the Eastman's think).Tragedy is clearly foreshadowed but it is well done as are the events that follow.The film culminates in a great trial scene where Raymond Burr, presaging his Perry Mason role, plays a tough District Attorney.The acting and direction is great all around.  Montgomery Clift is a tortured, somewhat insecure young man.  Elizabeth Taylor is at the height of her charm and beauty (If you never found her real attractive, see this one).  Shelly Winters is sympathetic and real, playing her role to a tee.This one is worthy of a place in any video library.",5,&quot;We'll scrimp and save...&quot;,1053302400,"05 19, 2003",2003,2537,"['film', 'based', 'story', 'naturalist', 'Theodore', 'Dreiser', 'A', 'Place', 'Sun', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'real', 'dilemma', 'many', 'young', 'men', 'women', 'have', 'faced', 'will', 'face.Young', 'George', 'Eastman', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'poor', 'nephew', 'manufacturing', 'scion', 'Wealthy', 'Uncle', 'Eastman', 'George', 'who', 'distantly', 'located', 'mother', 'come', 'town-offering', 'find', 'place', 'business.George', 'place', 'high', 'society', 'relatives', 'well-to-do', 'friends', 'clear', 'class', 'distinction', 'town', 'example', 'relatives', 'wonder', 'aloud', 'what', 'do', 'socially', 'scene', 'worksite', 'where', 'large', 'sign', 'door', 'something', 'quot', 'Factory', 'Employees', 'are', 'Forbidden', 'Point', 'quot', 'George', 'working', 'factory', 'learn', 'business', 'warned', 'cousin', 'stay', 'away', 'girls', 'always', 'be', 'conscious', 'Eastman', 'George', 'becomes', 'attracted', 'one', 'co-workers', 'Alice', 'Shelly', 'Winters', 'George', 'woos', 'eventually', 'relationship', 'intimate.Meanwhile', 'Uncle', 'George', 'encouragement', 'looking', 'promote', 'upstairs', 'Also', 'extremely', 'attractive', 'woman', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'upper', 'crust', 'note', 'George', 'socialite', 'party', 'totally', 'smitten.George', 'party', 'finally', 'visiting', 'Alice', 'late', 'evening', 'where', 'been', 'waiting', 'alone', 'celebrate', 'birthday', 'quot', 'Maybe', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'so', 'much', 'anymore', 'Maybe', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'all.', 'quot', 'lives', 'soon', 'become', 'more', 'complex', 'Alice', 'George', 'trouble', 'memorable', 'scene', 'Alice', 'doctor', 'George', 'waits', 'outside', 'doctor', 'will', 'only', 'offer', 'advice', 'not', 'procedure.George', 'sees', 'Liz', 'Taylor', 'again', 'love', 'Alice', 'options', 'are', 'very', 'limited', '1950', 'America', 'rights', 'got', 'ta', 'marry', 'family', 'family', 'meaning', 'matter', 'what', 'Eastman', 'think', '.Tragedy', 'clearly', 'foreshadowed', 'well', 'done', 'are', 'events', 'follow.The', 'film', 'culminates', 'great', 'trial', 'scene', 'where', 'Raymond', 'Burr', 'presaging', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'role', 'tough', 'District', 'Attorney.The', 'acting', 'direction', 'great', 'around', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'tortured', 'somewhat', 'insecure', 'young', 'man', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'height', 'charm', 'beauty', 'never', 'found', 'real', 'attractive', 'see', 'one', 'Shelly', 'Winters', 'sympathetic', 'real', 'playing', 'role', 'tee.This', 'one', 'worthy', 'place', 'video', 'library']",N/A

Growing up on the South Side of Chicago, I had so many dreams, fantasies, ambitions, etc. and thus, years later, immediately identified with George Eastman (Montgomery Clift) as well as with Jay Gatsby, so different in many ways but both hungering for acceptance and respectability, thereby to enhance their self-image. George Stevens' brilliant direction was rewarded with an Academy Award. Working with a screenplay based on Theodore Dreiser's bloated novel An American Tragedy, Stevens elicited from both Clift and Elizabeth Taylor (Angela Vickers) perhaps their finest performances on film. Both are ideally cast as star cross'd lovers, so near and yet so far from what both so passionately desire. Members of the supporting cast are outstanding, notably Shelley Winters (Alice Tripp), Anne Revere (Hannah Eastman), Sheppard Strudwick (Anthony Vickers), and Raymond Burr (Frank Marlowe). Young Eastman is torn between accepting essentially a blue-collar life (with some prospect for a white collar eventually) and doing whatever is necessary to join the society of affluence in which his beloved Angela is so comfortable.All decisions have consequences and some decisions have tragic consequences. George's decision to gratify himself sexually with Alice one rainy evening creates a complication for which he is ill-prepared. Eventually, he is held accountable for her death (even if viewed as an accident) because, at that point, he cannot endure a life with her nor a life without Angela. George may not deliberately eliminate Alice from his life but he certainly has no interest whatsoever in having any further contact with her. He is convicted of intent. This film received six Academy Awards: including director Stevens, costume designer Edith Head, and composer Franz Waxman, although An American in Paris was selected as best film in what must have been a close vote. The other nominees were Decision before Dawn, Quo Vadis, and A Streetcar Named Desire.When I recently saw this film again, I was reminded of one of Fitzgerald's short stories, ""Winter Dreams,"" in which a young man very much like George Eastman yearns to improve his station in life. For so many young men and women, the American Dream can become the American Tragedy.

Dreiser's omniscient, overly busy narrator not only insists on both telling us and showing us what each character is thinking but moralizes at every opportunity.  And despite the novel's reputation as an example of modern ""realism,"" it's as redundant a form of melodrama as I've ever encountered: not only is every emotion spelled out but it's spelled out again and again.The film, on the other hand, is a narrative of infinite suggestion and undeniable emotional power.  George Stevens' fluid, lyrical camera embraces his primary characters, and the faces of Montgomery Clift and Elizabeth Taylor tell us practically all we need to know about their feelings.  It might seem like this film is worlds apart from ""Swing Time,"" the 1930's Astaire-Rogers film also directed by Stevens.  But both films have in common a grace and choreography, an attention to the musical and the poetic that enables them to rise above their sources and their times.  George Eastman's tragedy (Clyde Griffith's, in the novel) resonates as memorably as Franz Waxman's haunting score, which somehow suggests that George's fatal passion may have been worth it after all.  Credit Stevens for producing one of the screen's most enduring romantic dramas and, for my money, coaxing out of Clift and Taylor their best screen performances.[Since writing the above, I've finished Part III of Dreiser's novel, the longest section and one that is only briefly referenced in the film.  It's brilliant writing (in spite of the style), and tough, disturbing reading, placing the reader in the turbulent stream of Clyde's consciousness.  Clyde is far less sympathetically portrayed than in the film with respect to his moral guilt, but virtually all American institutions are equally on trial, the church and its representatives no less than Clyde.  And there is no Angela!

Winner of six Oscars, including Stevens' sensitive direction and the adapted screenplay, it packs an emotional wallop and is a true film classic.  Theodore Dreiser's novel, AN AMERICAN TRAGEDY, has been updated by writers Michael Wilson and Harry Brown to post-World War Two Nevada.  Montgomery Clift is ideally cast as millionaire mill owner's son George Eastman, who befriends a homely, but sweet and likeable factory worker named Alice Tripp (a never-better Shelley Winters).  George gets promotions through hard work and falls in love with Alice, eventually getting her pregnant.  But he won't marry her because he also is smitten by glamorous rich girl Ann Vickers (Elizabeth Taylor in her first truly adult role).So we have a love triangle with a factory worker in love with a rich woman and a poor woman.  George wants to basically dump Alice so he can be with and maybe marry Ann.  The wealthy Eastman family is all for the marriage and does not know about Alice at all.  George wants Alice to get an abortion and stay out of his life, but she demands that he marry her or she will tell everything to the Eastman family.  Only Ann knows about Alice, and she sticks by George; the two share one of cinema history's greatest kisses during a party.  And you thought YOU had problems.  George has to find a way to get rid (i.e., murder) Alice and marry Ann.  Ah yes, convenient Lake Tahoe, a rental rowboat under an alias, and poor Alice cannot swim.  Hmm.  We are at the 75 minute mark of a 122 minute movie that is gripping and enormously engrossing.A PLACE IN THE SUN has been painstakingly made by one of Hollywood's greatest producer-directors--and a former cameraman for Laurel and Hardy back in the late 1920s.  William Mellor's exquisite B&W; photography is velvety rich, setting up visual contrasts between the worlds of Ann and Alice, along with elegant slow dissolves to also set up social contrasts; Franz Waxman's score is beautiful and sad.  Both gentlemen won Oscars here in a year that included A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE and AN AMERICAN IN PARIS.  I was born in a great movie year.The climax and ending to A PLACE IN THE SUN are sad and easy to guess.  Anne Revere is superb in a small role as George's poverty level missionary mother.  The finale packs a real punch in a movie with three truly immortal performances.  This may be one of the great movie dramas of all time.

217574,A3DAIA8AJNHK1B,6300215644,William J. Dunaj,"[1, 1]","This film makes us identify with the lead character's struggles to make a better life, being raised by itinerant street preachers, then working in a factory and becoming involved with a whining, clinging Shelley Winters, before he falls in love with Elizabeth Taylor, who accepts and loves him despite his poor origins and makes her industrialist family accept him. His dreams are shattered when the first girl then threatens to tell everyone he got her pregnant unless he marries her. He takes her out in a row boat he rented using a false name, having made arrangements that would allow him to escape unnoticed after capsizing the boat. The novel relates his thoughts and he has a change of heart feeling sorry for what he had planned, but she panics and stands up in the boat, causing him to reach for her, just before she falls overboard. The novel makes it clear that he did not push her and did nothing to make her fall, while the film cannot convey what he was thinking except by implication, but he did not try to save her once she was in the water. This is Theodore Dreiser's repeated theme of an normal person getting into a perilous situation through seemingly innocuous steps: as the false name and measures that he took to enable him to escape now doom him, as no one will ever believe it could have been an accident. The scene where Elizabeth Taylor says goodbye to him in prison before his execution is acted and directed so perfectly, it may be the best scene on film.  No film can be like a novel; but, this is an extraordinary film in its own right. The direction and the acting throughout are first-rate, and the beautiful musical score still haunts me. Charlie Chaplin was right, this may have been the best movie of all time. Montgomery Clift is exactly right for the male lead, Shelley Winters makes it easy to understand why someone might want to kill her, and Elizabeth Taylor at age 17 also makes it easy to understand why someone might want to kill Shelley Winters..",5,Charlie Chaplin was right it is the best American film of all time,1287100800,"10 15, 2010",2010,1992,"['film', 'identify', 'lead', 'character', 'struggles', 'make', 'better', 'life', 'being', 'raised', 'itinerant', 'street', 'preachers', 'then', 'working', 'factory', 'becoming', 'involved', 'whining', 'clinging', 'Shelley', 'Winters', 'love', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'who', 'poor', 'origins', 'industrialist', 'family', 'accept', 'dreams', 'are', 'shattered', 'when', 'first', 'girl', 'then', 'tell', 'everyone', 'got', 'pregnant', 'out', 'row', 'boat', 'rented', 'using', 'false', 'name', 'having', 'made', 'arrangements', 'would', 'allow', 'escape', 'unnoticed', 'capsizing', 'boat', 'novel', 'thoughts', 'change', 'heart', 'feeling', 'sorry', 'what', 'had', 'planned', 'panics', 'up', 'boat', 'causing', 'reach', 'just', 'overboard', 'novel', 'clear', 'did', 'not', 'push', 'did', 'nothing', 'make', 'fall', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'convey', 'what', 'was', 'thinking', 'implication', 'did', 'not', 'try', 'save', 'once', 'was', 'water', 'Theodore', 'Dreiser', 'repeated', 'theme', 'normal', 'person', 'getting', 'perilous', 'situation', 'seemingly', 'innocuous', 'steps', 'false', 'name', 'measures', 'took', 'enable', 'escape', 'now', 'one', 'will', 'ever', 'believe', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'accident', 'scene', 'where', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'goodbye', 'prison', 'execution', 'acted', 'directed', 'so', 'perfectly', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'scene', 'film', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'novel', 'extraordinary', 'film', 'own', 'right', 'direction', 'acting', 'are', 'first-rate', 'beautiful', 'musical', 'score', 'still', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', 'was', 'right', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'movie', 'time', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'exactly', 'right', 'male', 'lead', 'Shelley', 'Winters', 'easy', 'understand', 'why', 'someone', 'might', 'want', 'kill', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'age', '17', 'also', 'easy', 'understand', 'why', 'someone', 'might', 'want', 'kill', 'Shelley', 'Winters..']",N/A
