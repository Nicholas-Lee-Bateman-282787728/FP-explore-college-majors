899967,A23L2BR07AOBG1,B000929VTK,alex bushman,"[1, 1]","The directors of this documentary have every reason to make this film and take out all of the good things that Troy Duffy, did for them, but they didn't.  They show him in his confident, no frills best to show just how disappointing and sad it is that he never had an ounce of humility in his body.  You see Duffy making great music, you see Duffy getting along famously with his friends, you see him making his one claim to fame, Boondock Saints (which isn't a work of genius in anyone's mind, but entertaining on a basic level).  What Troy would have you believe and what the filmmakers don't even have to argue for is right here in the film.  You have the egomaniac not taking responsibility for his own actions, being tactless when confronted, purposely ruining relationships he started long ago.  You see some of this come out before he gets the contract and you see that people just shut up because they believe in him, and don't want to make him anymore mad than he is. Then, he takes over and doesn't allow anyone else collaborate about how things are going to work out (including the filmmakers). He tells them not to mess up and then he doesn't allow them to. There's no way that Troy Duffy was made to look bad by means of editing.  Look at the scene near the end when his brother and the rest of the band have meeting.  It follows these things: Troy lost all of his initial contracts for the band, movie, bar, etc., he makes the movie and takes it to the festival only to get scant distribution that doesn't make the money back. They get a record contract and release it, but it doesn't sell.  The band comes to him after the movie doesn't get distribution to tell him his focus must now be on the band and that they don't like the way he treats them and should change his ways, they say in the most loving way possible, and he doesn't listen to them. He just doesn't listen...that's what this movie is about: you need to listen to others, they aren't worthless.",5,A great example of emotional and accurate perspective.,1169510400,"01 23, 2007",2007,1974,"['directors', 'documentary', 'have', 'reason', 'make', 'film', 'take', 'out', 'good', 'things', 'Troy', 'Duffy', 'did', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'confident', 'frills', 'best', 'show', 'just', 'how', 'disappointing', 'sad', 'never', 'had', 'ounce', 'humility', 'body', 'see', 'Duffy', 'making', 'great', 'music', 'see', 'Duffy', 'getting', 'along', 'famously', 'friends', 'see', 'making', 'one', 'claim', 'fame', 'Boondock', 'Saints', ""n't"", 'work', 'genius', 'anyone', 'mind', 'entertaining', 'basic', 'level', 'What', 'Troy', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'what', 'filmmakers', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'argue', 'right', 'here', 'film', 'have', 'egomaniac', 'not', 'taking', 'responsibility', 'own', 'actions', 'being', 'tactless', 'when', 'confronted', 'purposely', 'ruining', 'relationships', 'started', 'long', 'ago', 'see', 'come', 'out', 'contract', 'see', 'people', 'just', 'shut', 'up', 'believe', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'make', 'anymore', 'mad', 'Then', ""n't"", 'allow', 'anyone', 'else', 'collaborate', 'how', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'work', 'out', 'including', 'filmmakers', 'not', 'mess', 'up', 'then', ""n't"", 'allow', 'way', 'Troy', 'Duffy', 'was', 'made', 'look', 'bad', 'means', 'editing', 'Look', 'scene', 'end', 'when', 'brother', 'rest', 'band', 'have', 'meeting', 'things', 'Troy', 'lost', 'initial', 'contracts', 'band', 'movie', 'bar', 'etc.', 'movie', 'festival', 'only', 'get', 'scant', 'distribution', ""n't"", 'make', 'money', 'back', 'get', 'record', 'contract', 'release', ""n't"", 'sell', 'band', 'movie', ""n't"", 'get', 'distribution', 'tell', 'focus', 'must', 'now', 'be', 'band', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'way', 'should', 'change', 'ways', 'say', 'most', 'loving', 'way', 'possible', ""n't"", 'listen', 'just', ""n't"", 'listen', 'what', 'movie', 'need', 'listen', 'others', 'are', ""n't"", 'worthless']",Overnight VHS
899968,A34PAZQ73SL163,B000929VTK,"Bernard Chapin ""Ora Et Labora!""","[5, 6]","This movie and the accompanying rise and fall of Troy Duffy just goes to show that detached, narcissistic people can come from all social classes. Miramax pictures gives the blue-collar Duffy everything he ever wanted out of life by offering him a bar, a band contract, and the permission to make his own movie. He's got the world by the orbs but somehow he manages to bring about his own doom. Which brings us around to the only thing missing in an otherwise excellent documentary, not enough is revealed about the exact nature of Troy's decline. We are made privy to Miramax's change of attitude towards him but why did they suddenly hold him in such low esteem? What did he say? Who did he torment? I wish I knew. That would have made for a wonderful extra sequence in the movie.The offensiveness of Duffy's personality is a major reason why this film is so fascinating. This fellow never seems to get tired of listening to himself talk yet he never has anything to say. He loves to pontificate but is work averse. The protagonist offers up a fine lesson for the young as he is proof that nothing good is ever produced by a negative attitude. A toxic personality is warmly received by no one. Duffy is a sadist who tortures his band, brother, and friends by making their life revolve around his. He forces his bandmates to live in poverty just to fulfill his lust for control. His paranoia leaks out onto an audience of students at Boston University, and one almost feels sorry for him due to the fact that those present have to know he's as mad as a hatter. Ultimately, Duffy is an important case study for those wishing to learn about narcissism. He also makes a fine subject for a documentary and I recommend this one wholeheartedly.",4,Championship Loser.,1139875200,"02 14, 2006",2006,1739,"['movie', 'accompanying', 'rise', 'fall', 'Troy', 'Duffy', 'just', 'show', 'detached', 'narcissistic', 'people', 'can', 'come', 'social', 'classes', 'Miramax', 'blue-collar', 'Duffy', 'everything', 'ever', 'wanted', 'life', 'offering', 'bar', 'band', 'contract', 'permission', 'make', 'own', 'movie', 'got', 'world', 'orbs', 'somehow', 'bring', 'about', 'own', 'doom', 'Which', 'only', 'thing', 'missing', 'otherwise', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'not', 'enough', 'revealed', 'exact', 'nature', 'Troy', 'decline', 'are', 'made', 'privy', 'Miramax', 'change', 'attitude', 'towards', 'why', 'did', 'suddenly', 'hold', 'such', 'low', 'esteem', 'What', 'did', 'say', 'Who', 'did', 'torment', 'wish', 'knew', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'wonderful', 'extra', 'sequence', 'movie.The', 'offensiveness', 'Duffy', 'personality', 'major', 'reason', 'why', 'film', 'so', 'fascinating', 'fellow', 'never', 'get', 'tired', 'listening', 'talk', 'yet', 'never', 'anything', 'say', 'pontificate', 'work', 'averse', 'protagonist', 'up', 'fine', 'lesson', 'young', 'proof', 'nothing', 'good', 'ever', 'produced', 'negative', 'attitude', 'toxic', 'personality', 'warmly', 'received', 'one', 'Duffy', 'sadist', 'who', 'band', 'brother', 'friends', 'making', 'life', 'revolve', 'bandmates', 'live', 'poverty', 'just', 'fulfill', 'lust', 'control', 'paranoia', 'out', 'audience', 'students', 'Boston', 'University', 'one', 'almost', 'feels', 'sorry', 'due', 'fact', 'present', 'have', 'know', 'as', 'mad', 'hatter', 'Ultimately', 'Duffy', 'important', 'case', 'study', 'wishing', 'learn', 'narcissism', 'also', 'fine', 'subject', 'documentary', 'recommend', 'one', 'wholeheartedly']",Overnight VHS

Unfortunately for himself, Duffy was an egotistical control freak who insisted on claiming all the glory and credit for the good things that happened to him and assigning blame for all of the bad.  This documentary chronicles his downfall as he disrespects and mistreats nearly everyone he encounters, ultimately losing all of his great opportunities.When I first heard about this film, I wondered if anyone whose actions don't affect the public really deserves this kind of treatment.  I was also leery about the honesty of the filmmakers; after all, you could probably make anybody look bad with selective editing.  I still have some reservations, but after having seen the film, it's kind of hard to see how they could have edited it to make him look good.  He makes some stunningly unkind statements to people to whom he claims to be loyal and seems to revel in the chance to put others down and force them to acknowledge his ""superiority.""This film serves as a cautionary tale about how not to treat people.  I imagine that Duffy will see this film someday if he hasn't already.

899978,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,B000929VTK,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[3, 5]","I'm surfing on the TV, and I came across this film on Sundance.  The first thing I see is Troy Duffy screaming into a cell phone with a torrent of profanity.  I thought it was a parody of a Hollywood #$%#$%.  It turns out it WAS a Hollywood $#%#$# named Troy Duffy.  While watching this, I was just amazed.  Troy Duffy sold a script to Miramax, got to direct it, plus a record deal for his band, The Brood.  Yet, he blew it all and so spectacularly.  I have heard it said and written that when you are successful, that brings out the real you.  Well, Troy is the biggest #$%#$ on the planet.  He screams, he yells, threatens people, keeps reminding everyone that he's the greatest artist on the planet, and that everyone around him should be fighting over who gets to lick his #$%#% (many actors stop by Troy's bar, and start fawning all over him, especially Mark Walhberg).  He says the right things in interviews, but behind the scenes his true personality is coming out.  It's kind of a shame because his film, The Boondock Saints, is a decent film.  It is not a Citizen Kane like debut (quite frankly, I'm surprised that Troy didn't compare his film to Kane), but Saints was entertaining.  It's pretty much a product of the 1990's, violent, profane, stylish, but no substance.  But since Troy is/was so difficult (to put it mildly), he has yet to make another film, and there's a good chance he won't.  Contrary to popular belief, you cannot get away with everything in Hollywood.  It is very similar to any other kind of business.  Duffy hadn't even had a track record yet, and started acting like a major jerk.  Miramax ended up putting Troy's script in turnaround, but he did secure financing for Boondock from other sources (at a fraction of the original budget).  A very small independent distributor picked up Saints, and it played a week in theaters and died.  Some have suggested that this film is very biased, and it never showed Troy's good side.  For my part, I can't possibly see any good from him, other than The Boondock Saints is a decent film.  A lot of directors nowadays expect to be treated like Spielberg and Kubrick right away.  They forget that Spielberg and Kubrick EARNED their power by being great filmmakers.  As for the actual documentary itself, it has its share of faults.  It doesn't really flow as a film, and it never actually explains why Harvey Weinstein and Miramax dropped Troy so quickly.  Was Troy really rude to Harvey?  We never get to hear and/or see that phone call.  Did Harvey just realise he made a mistake, and that the film ultimately couldn't live up to the media hype it was getting?  Harvey actually appears in the film where Troy is at Cannes trying to get distribution for his film, but there is no attempt to contact Harvey and ask him his opinion.  Considering Troy and his cohorts do nothing but trash Weinstein (and many other Hollywood heavyweights), it wouldn't surprise me if Troy told Harvey to kiss his rear.  None of these questions are ever really answered.  Troy has been playing the ""matyred artist"" card since his film debuted, and many people have bought into it (Saints has gotten some cult status on DVD).

As it stands you just get bored with seeing Troy Duffy attack anyone who dares criticize him.  Twice, three times, four times, that would have been enough to establish his character as a sociopath.  But directors Montana and Smith just play it over and over again, maybe forty-five times.  Enough!  I guess working with Troy didn't teach them anything about restraint.Naturally the documentary makes me curious to see BOONDOCK SAINTS.  Most of the actors glimpsed in the movie, hanging out at Duffy's bar and grill, seem to be auditioning, like Patrick Swayze, a legend in Hollywood but a man who badly needs a shot of adrenaline career-wise.  When it comes to actually making the film, BOONDOCK SAINTS behind the scenes footage shows us more extended interviews with Willem Dafoe and with Scotland's Billy Connolly, who comes across as an honestly swell guy, not to mention a living legend, who must have been either momentarily blinded to Troy's faults, or he's big enough to forgive him.Yes, life in Hollywood is surreal, like something Salvador Dali and Bunuel cooked up together on a slow Spanish afternoon.  And Harvey Weinstein seems like slime.  But Troy, did you have to be so condescending to every human being on planet earth?

Well, ""Overnight"" is a cautionary tale of what not to do if you find yourself in this rare situation.  There's a difference between a toe in the door and a seat at the table.""Overnight"" shows flash in the pan Hollywood sensation, Troy Duffy, as the man who never gets the concept.Troy Duffy is a foul-mouthed, hard-drinking, cigarette puffing guy with no citable academic or career accomplishments.  Yet he fell ass backwards into the type of situation people dream about:  A movie deal (writing and directing), a record deal, and co-owner-ship of an increasingly popular glitterati drinking/slumming hole.  While doing an excellent job of showing Duffy plow into the ground with his engines still pushing harder, ""Overnight"" fails to capture exactly what event turned Troy's Midas touch into a sewage plant.  (Although I can understand that more than one or two meetings with this guy could turn just about anyone off.)  The addition of that angle is understandably hard to obtain considering the various players, yet ""Overnight"" still manages to engagingly chronicle Duffy's briefly rising star followed by his rapid descent into ego-driven self-destruction, paranoia, and sour grapes.It would be instructive for an ""Overnight"" viewer to see Duffy's one and only movie ""The Boondock Saints"" beforehand (the nearly-straight-to-cable effort that he both wrote and directed).  The Boondock Saints is a genuinely enjoyable dark violent action movie, and it's particularly amazing when you consider that it was Duffy's first crack at anything remotely cinematic.  Overnight briefly shows Duffy on the set of ""TBS"" working as a director; one of the few sequences when we see him happy, affable, and accessible.  It's just too bad that this Troy Duffy completely disappears in almost every other aspect of his life.  (Interesting note:  The Boondock Saints DVD commentary track lays all the blame for the lack of mainstream marketing of the film on the Columbine shootings - an assertion almost completely erased by the events shown in Overnight.)One bad play after another, one more verbal exchange carried to the limit.  The working class, boozing, smoking, urban toughie clich&eacute; carried way to far, way to often.  Duffy doesn't burn bridges, he carpet bombs them and screams at the edges.  Whether he's alternately toadying, then threatening to play hardball with Harvey Weinstein, or working on his master plan to pit studios against each other to pump up his paydays (almost pathetic as Duffy straddles a 2nd-hand chair in a chintzy primer-coated office while chain-smoking in his bib overalls), or berating his friends and relatives as untalented hangers-on, he displays a supremely misplaced confidence in his own judgment in all matters.Even as a potential source of information for others, he still can't quite stoop to their level.  Asked to discuss his particular path through Hollywood with some film students, Duffy dismisses them as mere dilettantes unable to understand the depths of his pain, the scale of his disappointment at the world's failure to revere his singular genius.  (Yes, even in the depth of his sorrows, Duffy's capacity surpasses the conception of all those around him.)And it is a shame, there was some talent there.

As far as films go, it's wasn't the most well produced documentary, as it showed little more than a narcissistic control freak berating and bragging his way through the whole film with little insight into the thoughts of those around him. I guess they would have to ask his permission to have an independant thought concerning his groundbreaking, never been done before project. As inadequate as the actual film was, the message came through loud and clear. This guy blew it and has no one to blame but himself.Early in the film, a friend of Duffy's says something like, ""He deserves everything he's gonna get"". At the time, he was commenting on how hard Troy had worked to kick doors down and live his dream, had signed a million dollar production deal to direct and cut a movie based on  his own screenplay, and would deserve the success from his efforts. These words proved prophetic, but for entirely different reasons related to karma. Mr. Duffy abused everyone, convinced that he was the biggest thing Hollywood or the music industry had ever seen. I wish there had been at least some coverage of the band recording their album so I could see whether any of his feelings of grandeur were in any way justified, but with all the priceless footage of him being a total tool, there wasn't time for much else. The band was dropped from their label after selling only 690 copies, so I'm assuming they aren't the next Beatles. He managed to make the movie and it played in a few theatres before ending up on DVD. I felt guilty that I had bought a copy of Boondock Saints and Overnight and payed this A-hole a royalty, until a graphic ran at the end of the movie that said his deal with William Morris agency did not include a percentage of TV or dvd sales, so he got squat! I know this guy was doing all the work to promote himself and the band while most of the other guys looked on like deer in the headlights, and felt entitled to all the credit for breaking the band, but he basically told his own brother (the guitar player in their band) he could go to heck and would never have any input in anything. He then told the ""friends"" filming the documentary that they weren't entitled to one red cent and they were just hangers-on, lucky to be in his presence. Note to self: if I'm ever in this situation, wait until AFTER the documentary is done before pissing off the guys in charge of cutting the tape together. When guys like this crash and burn, it's hard to feel sorry for them. He accomplished more than most people are able too, but that makes the fall from grace that much harder and the regrets that much more intense. What a shame.

899984,AWPODHOB4GFWL,B000929VTK,"Martin A Hogan ""Marty From SF""","[4, 5]","A Boston bartender (Troy Duffy) writes a screenplay with his band supplying the soundtrack and almost overnight, Harvey Weinstein (Miramax) gives him a chance at stardom nobody could ever dream of.  Bartender Duffy is portrayed throughout this documentary as a maniac intent on conquering the Hollywood world of idiots and proving that he is a genius of major proportions that will never be appreciated.  He is right - he never gets the appreciation he thinks he deserves.  It is an amazing film showing Duffy as a relentlessly driven person, who burns every bridge he can, insults every person he can and systematically destroys everything anyone could hope for.  His vulgarity and arrogance has no limit and it grows tiresome within minutes.  Initially, he is seen as crazy, then perhaps a person with a personality disorder and finally, in the last few scenes as a paranoid schizophrenic muttering to himself in an alley.  It is a story of a man who destroys himself and the people around him.  Unlike any other `car wreck' story, Duffy and his friends (the band ""Boondock Saints"") go from very modest beginnings to the heights of Hollywood, the Cannes Film Festival, the Palm Springs Film Festival and eventual destruction.

JEFFREY MCMAHON ""herculodge""","[22, 24]","The documentary Overnight chronicles the manner in which Troy Duffy, hyped-up screenwriter of The Boondock Saints, behaves like a malignant bully toward his buddies, his agents, and his producers. Duffy sees himself as a working-class hero whose genius was discovered by the right people. But what we see, contrary to Duffy, is an overgrown shrieking infant seething with megalomaniacal tantrums, self-aggrandizing fantasies, and paranoid delusions who, alienating everyone, sees himself as an innocent victim. One is tempted to think that the promise of wealth turned him into such a bilious, obnoxious lout, like those characters turned rotten in The Treasure of Sierra Madre. But at the end of the documentary we are given a deliciously insightful quote from Albert Goldman, which sets the record straight:""No man is really changed by success.

It's also about an unspoken exchange by those so impressed with celebrity that they put up with that jerk's abhorrent behavior.  Troy keeps his abusive hold on his cohorts, so long as they perceive that they are also on their way to ""the big time"".  You see a look on their faces resembling hapless puppies ...too intimidated to speak up to Troy Duffy, the incipient Director maverick --that is, until his house of cards completely folds.  Then normal human boundaries resume and grievances are tabled.  That's the other side of the story.  That's the sickness of the whole system.Within a cultural vacuum of values, a guy like Troy really COULD and usually does go far. His only mistake was that he revealed his ego-maniacal behavior too fast to the power-brokers that ""made"" him.Again, Hubris like Troy's is alive and well in Hollywood.  His is a familiar personality-type that does set things in motion and gets things done.  As much as I hate to say it, it's true. Had his gestation into the entertainment world included a modicum of tact, we'd all be celebrating Mr. Duffy today as some sort of American treasure.  His story is much closer to the norm, vs. being an anomaly in terms of type.Interestingly, even after experiencing a promising directorial career turned to shambles, the mechanisms of denial only enlarge.  Troy,  brimming with resentment for ""the system"" (a result of his self-inflicted travails), is invited to speak to a group of university film school students.  There he presses his advantage and systematically degrades the aspiring filmmakers in the most predatory question-and-answer session this side of the Jerry Springer Show.  The result could be comedic, except that you see each innocent soul being laid open like raw meat, as Troy gladly applies the salt.  This spectacle includes shots of the bow-tie-wearing, shrinking and silent professor.  Once again, all is tolerated because Troy's ""been to Hollywood"" and that's what's honored.There's a lot to recommend here as an instructive example of the seedy edge of Filmland's deal-making (and breaking), as well as operant illustrations of sycophantic behavior.  It's a cautionary tale..

899987,A3CCYAQRHUTPIQ,B000929VTK,Mr. A. Pomeroy,"[11, 13]","Yes, it's a portrait of Troy Duffy. But what's it like as a film? The answer is that it's only so-so. Troy is a fascinating subject, but the film has almost no context, and it goes on too long. It has a similar setup to that 9/11 documentary, in the sense that the film-makers - friends of Duffy, in the sense that Beast Man was a 'friend' of Skeletor - were originally going to make a straightforward documentary about an up-and-coming director, but disaster intervened and the film-makers ended up making a good egg out of a bad chicken.You will notice that all the other reviews are actually about Troy, they are not really about the film. The film-makers have not made any other films, and although Overnight has nothing overtly wrong with it, it doesn't really tell us about anything except Troy Duffy. We learn almost nothing about the film he is making, a film which I have not seen, and have no desire to see. A top-quality documentary would have tried to put Troy into context - how did he get a film deal? How was he different from the other, similar, post-Tarantino movie brats such as Gary Fleder (""Things to do in Denver when you're dead"") or Alan Taylor (""Palookaville"") or a dozen others? Granted, those people are still working today, mostly in TV or direct-to-DVD, whereas Troy is not working at all, and so Troy must have been unusually crap, but it's hard to tell how unusually crap he must have been from the documentary.The key thing for me is that, although Troy comes across as mindbendingly loud and profane, I was under the impression that all Hollywood producers and directors were like that. It is as if Troy is acting out a part that he has learned from watching documentaries about Hollywood film producers; for someone who had never directed or written a film before, he nonetheless manages to recover from a major setback (Miramax dumps him) and assemble a cast and direct a film which is released. That's more than I have done. We learn very little about this process - how did Troy make the film? Why did people put up with him? If he is capable of alienating his own brother, how did he direct actors? How come Willem Dafoe - an actor with a career - did not tell him to pip off? What stopped Billy Connolly from punching him out?Troy is like R Lee Ermey in ""Full Metal Jacket"", in that he is a monster, but he is an entertaining and engaging monster. Eventually he becomes tiring, although there are a couple of memorably extended tirades (he is at his worst on the telephone), and the ending almost leaves you feeling sorry for him. He does have an odd charisma, and at the very least he gives the impression that he knows what he is doing. I can understand why people might follow him, even though he is not a Good King. The documentary leaves me wondering firstly what happened to Troy, and secondly how has Overnight itself affected his career? I only knew he existed because of this documentary, I imagine film producers are fully aware of it. I also wonder why the filmmakers themselves have done nothing since, not even on cable television.",3,King of Kings,1139097600,"02 5, 2006",2006,3082,"['Yes', 'portrait', 'Troy', 'Duffy', 'what', 'film', 'answer', 'only', 'so-so', 'Troy', 'fascinating', 'subject', 'film', 'almost', 'context', 'too', 'long', 'similar', 'setup', '9/11', 'documentary', 'sense', 'film-makers', 'friends', 'Duffy', 'sense', 'Beast', 'Man', 'was', ""'friend"", ""'"", 'Skeletor', 'were', 'originally', 'going', 'make', 'straightforward', 'documentary', 'up-and-coming', 'director', 'disaster', 'intervened', 'film-makers', 'ended', 'up', 'making', 'good', 'egg', 'bad', 'chicken.You', 'will', 'notice', 'other', 'reviews', 'are', 'actually', 'Troy', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'film', 'film-makers', 'have', 'not', 'made', 'other', 'films', 'Overnight', 'nothing', 'overtly', 'wrong', ""n't"", 'really', 'tell', 'anything', 'Troy', 'Duffy', 'learn', 'almost', 'nothing', 'film', 'making', 'film', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'have', 'desire', 'see', 'top-quality', 'documentary', 'would', 'have', 'tried', 'put', 'Troy', 'context', 'how', 'did', 'get', 'film', 'deal', 'How', 'was', 'different', 'other', 'similar', 'post-Tarantino', 'movie', 'brats', 'such', 'Gary', 'Fleder', 'Things', 'do', 'Denver', 'when', ""'re"", 'dead', 'Alan', 'Taylor', 'Palookaville', 'dozen', 'others', 'Granted', 'people', 'are', 'still', 'working', 'today', 'mostly', 'TV', 'direct-to-DVD', 'whereas', 'Troy', 'not', 'working', 'so', 'Troy', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'unusually', 'crap', 'hard', 'tell', 'how', 'unusually', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'documentary.The', 'key', 'thing', 'Troy', 'mindbendingly', 'loud', 'profane', 'was', 'impression', 'Hollywood', 'producers', 'directors', 'were', 'Troy', 'acting', 'out', 'part', 'learned', 'watching', 'documentaries', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'producers', 'someone', 'who', 'had', 'never', 'directed', 'written', 'film', 'before', 'nonetheless', 'recover', 'major', 'setback', 'Miramax', 'assemble', 'cast', 'direct', 'film', 'released', 'more', 'have', 'done', 'learn', 'very', 'little', 'process', 'how', 'did', 'Troy', 'make', 'film', 'Why', 'did', 'people', 'put', 'up', 'capable', 'alienating', 'own', 'brother', 'how', 'did', 'direct', 'actors', 'How', 'come', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'actor', 'career', 'did', 'not', 'tell', 'pip', 'off', 'What', 'stopped', 'Billy', 'Connolly', 'punching', 'out', 'Troy', 'R', 'Lee', 'Ermey', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Jacket', 'monster', 'entertaining', 'engaging', 'monster', 'Eventually', 'tiring', 'are', 'couple', 'memorably', 'extended', 'tirades', 'worst', 'telephone', 'ending', 'almost', 'feeling', 'sorry', 'have', 'odd', 'charisma', 'very', 'least', 'impression', 'what', 'doing', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'people', 'might', 'follow', 'even', 'not', 'Good', 'King', 'documentary', 'wondering', 'firstly', 'what', 'happened', 'Troy', 'secondly', 'how', 'Overnight', 'affected', 'career', 'only', 'knew', 'existed', 'documentary', 'imagine', 'film', 'producers', 'are', 'fully', 'aware', 'also', 'wonder', 'why', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'done', 'nothing', 'not', 'even', 'cable', 'television']",Overnight VHS

Duffy's script was originally optioned by Harvey Weinstein, and Miramax were slated to finance and release the picture; the trials and tribulations of getting the picture made after Weinstein bailed are the stuff of Hollywood legend. Montana and Smith were there the whole way, charting the fascinating story of The Boondock Saints and Duffy's band, The Brood, who landed a deal with Atlantic for the soundtrack.While much of the blame for the shenanigans here can be placed solely on the head of Harvey Weinstein, there's no denying that Duffy, in many ways, made his own bed. There's nothing here that shows him as a very likable guy, even though the statements he makes throughout the documentary about the quality of both The Boondock Saints and its soundtrack are dead-on; the man simply has no tact whatsoever. Combine that with a hair-trigger temper, and it's pretty easy to see why no one in Hollywood wanted to work with him, even once he had a brilliant film in the can. (The filmmakers do insinuate, though, that Duffy's charge that Weinstein blacklisted him in Hollywood is not unwarranted.) Once again, we learn the lesson that art cannot overcome politics, at least not in Hollywood.This is a must-watch for any Boondock Saints fan, especially those of us who have been wondering why Diffy has been having such a hard time getting financing for All Saints' Day.
