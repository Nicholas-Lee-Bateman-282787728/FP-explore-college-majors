1162798,A3BRVQ5J0LAUU2,B0019APR80,Sarah,"[16, 16]","I've wanted to see this film for a while now, being a fan of Michel Ocelot's previous work, Kirikou and the Sorceress. He has a wonderful style of animation, and a good knack for telling traditional fairy tales and folk tales. In Princes and Princesses, he does something rather unique, which I was quite excited to see: the animation is done with cutouts, using only black silhouettes and brightly colored backgrounds to tell the story. I think this technique worked wonderfully in this instance, since this is in fact 6 short fairy tales, tied together by the fact that it is a teacher and his two pupils that are thinking them up/acting out each story.I absolutely adore fairy tales, folk tales and mythology, and each of the story here takes place in a different culture, which was quite fun. The first story is called ""The Princess of Diamonds"", and it is kind of a general fairy tale. The second one is called ""The Fig Boy"", and takes place in ancient Egypt, inspired by hieroglyphs. The third is a medieval tale called ""The Sorceress"". The fourth is a Japanese tale inspired by the works of Hokusai. The fifth is a Grimm Brothers-esque story with a bit of sci-fi thrown in (why not?). And the final one is a kind of parody of English tales. The nice thing about the smaller stories is also that it keeps the attention of little ones or those with short attention spans, as each is only a few minutes long.And yes, it is only available in French with English subtitles, and some of those subtitles are not always correct or spell-checked. But my 11-year-old sister and I had no problem following the movie. All in all, I was very pleased with this little film. Definitely my cup of tea, and a wonderful addition to any fairy tale collection.",5,Charming and unique...,1234915200,"02 18, 2009",2009,1747,"[""'ve"", 'wanted', 'see', 'film', 'while', 'now', 'being', 'fan', 'Michel', 'Ocelot', 'previous', 'work', 'Kirikou', 'Sorceress', 'wonderful', 'style', 'animation', 'good', 'knack', 'telling', 'traditional', 'fairy', 'tales', 'folk', 'tales', 'Princes', 'Princesses', 'something', 'rather', 'unique', 'was', 'quite', 'excited', 'see', 'animation', 'done', 'cutouts', 'using', 'only', 'black', 'silhouettes', 'brightly', 'colored', 'backgrounds', 'tell', 'story', 'think', 'technique', 'worked', 'wonderfully', 'instance', 'fact', '6', 'short', 'fairy', 'tales', 'tied', 'together', 'fact', 'teacher', 'two', 'pupils', 'are', 'thinking', 'up/acting', 'out', 'story.I', 'absolutely', 'fairy', 'tales', 'folk', 'tales', 'mythology', 'story', 'here', 'place', 'different', 'culture', 'was', 'quite', 'fun', 'first', 'story', 'called', 'Princess', 'Diamonds', 'kind', 'general', 'fairy', 'tale', 'second', 'one', 'called', 'Fig', 'Boy', 'place', 'ancient', 'Egypt', 'inspired', 'hieroglyphs', 'third', 'medieval', 'tale', 'called', 'Sorceress', 'fourth', 'Japanese', 'tale', 'inspired', 'works', 'Hokusai', 'fifth', 'Grimm', 'Brothers-esque', 'story', 'bit', 'sci-fi', 'thrown', 'why', 'not', 'final', 'one', 'kind', 'parody', 'English', 'tales', 'nice', 'thing', 'smaller', 'stories', 'also', 'attention', 'little', 'ones', 'short', 'attention', 'spans', 'only', 'few', 'minutes', 'long.And', 'yes', 'only', 'available', 'French', 'English', 'subtitles', 'subtitles', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'correct', 'spell-checked', '11-year-old', 'sister', 'had', 'problem', 'following', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'pleased', 'little', 'film', 'Definitely', 'cup', 'tea', 'wonderful', 'addition', 'fairy', 'tale', 'collection']",N/A

It also pays homage to the oldest extant feature-length animation,The Adventures of Prince Achmed. The silhouetted characters in this draw directly from that older movie, even if the characters and magic gadget are quite contemporary.A half-dozen vignettes form this feature, with a little story-telling glue between them. In that outer story, a boy and girl share a fantasy. Then, with the help of the gadget, they enter into it. One of those stories has the flavor of a Japanese folktale, another shows the magic kiss gone terribly (and repeatedly) wrong, another shows a science fiction variation on the quest for the princess's hand, and so on.
