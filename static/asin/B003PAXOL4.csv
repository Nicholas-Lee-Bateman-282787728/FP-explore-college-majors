But, his character does play an important part in the drama being played out and ,if you can understand the British accents, it's an interesting family drama.  I especially appreciated the ending twist. (No spoilers).  Strong womean dominate this pic and, all in all, I enjoyed it.  Catherine Tate is great as a frustrated mother who needs to come to terms with what she's been dealt by life.  A bit different from her comedic fare on British TV and on latter seasons of &#34;The Office.&#34;",4,Good family drama with a twist at the end,1358380800,"01 17, 2013",2013,647,"['others', 'have', 'said', 'movie', 'not', 'centered', 'Rob', 'Pattinson', 'face', 'can', 'barely', 'see', 'even', 'when', 'appear', 'due', 'voluminous', 'bangs', 'character', 'play', 'important', 'part', 'drama', 'being', 'played', 'out', 'can', 'understand', 'British', 'accents', 'interesting', 'family', 'drama', 'especially', 'appreciated', 'ending', 'twist', 'spoilers', 'Strong', 'womean', 'dominate', 'pic', 'enjoyed', 'Catherine', 'Tate', 'great', 'frustrated', 'mother', 'who', 'come', 'terms', 'what', 'been', 'dealt', 'life', 'bit', 'different', 'comedic', 'fare', 'British', 'TV', 'latter', 'seasons', '34', 'Office.', '34']",The Bad Mother's Handbook

1356617,A2MWM7DKQ1SJPF,B003PAXOL4,Cindy,"[37, 37]","This made for TV movie was based on the best-selling novel: The Bad Mother's Handbook by Kate Long.Like most people purchasing this DVD, I bought it because Robert Pattinson played a character in it. And I admit, I had low expectations of enjoying anything more than his appearance in it. Of course, that is WHY they are marketing this movie the way they are.What I was NOT expecting was to see so LITTLE of Rob and yet to enjoy this movie so much. This is a very moving, funny, thought-provoking film. I LOVED the glimpses of Rob... he is so young and plays awkward SO well. Adorable. But I was not disappointed, even though I would have enjoyed seeing more of him, because the Bad Mother's Handbook is just that GOOD.The story is about a dysfunctional, multigenerational family of women. Middle-aged Karen is stressed and frustrated, struggling to care for both a teenage daughter and mother with Alzheimer's. She has a bit of an identity crisis when she discovers a long-kept secret. Her bright but hormonal daughter, Charlotte, has her own crisis when she discovers that she's pregnant about the same time her dead-beat boyfriend dumps her. Enter Daniel (Robert Pattinson), a new student and doctor's son, who tries to support her in his own nerdy way. Karen strikes out at both her mother and daughter in bitter disappointment, but all the turmoil serves to teach them all some important lessons about love, family, and being a mother. I laughed and had tears...My advice - if you think this movie stars Rob, lower your expectations and you'll be better able to enjoy a very good movie.HINT: If you aren't used to HEAVY British/Scottish accents, you might want to turn on the English SUBTITLES.

1356620,A32ZD3CMV82ETI,B003PAXOL4,Gia,"[1, 1]","I absolutely ADORED this movie!  Sign me admittedly guilty of buying this DVD only because of the RPattz factor. However, this movie turned out to have a much more substantial storyline than I initially expected.  It was refreshing, compelling,and endearing with a twist of humor.  The dynamics of the grandmother, mother, and daughter relationships were thought provoking.  The storyline gives you much to consider and want to discuss later.  I never would have expected this high caliber from a supposed B teen angst movie.  However, a disconnect for me was they didn't show how the other students, faculty or neighbors, etc. reacted towards a pregnant teen in British society.  I would have appreciated seeing those struggles.  Charlotte's pregnancy came across as unrealistically commonplace and acceptable minus any hardships, ostracism, repercussions, etc.; whereas the rest of the movie was so painfully realistic at times that I was moved to tears.  There wasn't a message for teens not to get pregnant here.  I found the meaning was more directed towards women, their relationships and honesty.  Nonetheless, I liked the film very much. It was entertaining and left you wanting to know more.  I thought all the actors even down to the saucy ex-husband did a convincing impressive portrayal.  As far as the RPattz factor, I thought he was amazing and did one of his best performances as the awkward geek.  Frankly, he stole every scene with his warm humor and gentle approach although he was only in a handful of scenes (still worth buying the DVD though for fans!).  He had a natural ease in his acting delivery then, which I think he should get back to in the films he's doing now.  I'd highly recommend this movie for RPattz fans, pregnant teens and people looking for their birth mothers - not sure who else would find this film as amusing as I did!  I plan to watch it over and over again.
