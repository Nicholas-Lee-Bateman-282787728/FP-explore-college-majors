This is a classic that, among other things,  showcases the disabled, otherwise at that time, known as handicapped.  Life goes on even with Ironside being confined to a wheelchair.  Just like the tv show ""Emergency"" that changed America forever by demonstrating the need for emergency vehicles and personnel, the show Ironside was groundbreaking.  Just because you can't walk any longer doesn't mean your life is over.  so between solving cases, he brings to light the possibilites.",4,classic ironside - always a delight yet groundbreaking in its content,1379289600,"09 16, 2013",2013,552,"['was', 'great', 'see', 'Raymond', 'Burr', 'again', 'playing', 'part', 'Ironside', 'classic', 'other', 'things', 'disabled', 'otherwise', 'time', 'known', 'handicapped', 'Life', 'even', 'Ironside', 'being', 'confined', 'wheelchair', 'Just', 'tv', 'show', 'Emergency', 'changed', 'America', 'forever', 'demonstrating', 'need', 'emergency', 'vehicles', 'personnel', 'show', 'Ironside', 'was', 'groundbreaking', 'Just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'walk', 'longer', ""n't"", 'mean', 'life', 'over', 'so', 'solving', 'cases', 'light', 'possibilites']",Ironside - The Best of Season 1

There are several episodes on the DVD but I frankly haven't looked at any of the others. It's the great pilot episode that I wanted, for my DVD library. The image quality is a little soft, about like a VHS tape, but it's been 45 years and God only knows how many prints have been made for syndication. I'm not big on cop shows generally, but this pilot is first rate. Highly recommended.",5,Ironside Pilot,1336953600,"05 14, 2012",2012,490,"['one', 'great', 'TV', 'pilots', 'One', 'TV', 'reviewer', 'called', 'Classy', 'well', 'done', 'was', 'right', 'too', 'are', 'several', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'frankly', 'have', ""n't"", 'looked', 'others', 'great', 'pilot', 'episode', 'wanted', 'DVD', 'library', 'image', 'quality', 'little', 'soft', 'VHS', 'tape', 'been', '45', 'years', 'God', 'only', 'how', 'many', 'prints', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'syndication', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'cop', 'shows', 'generally', 'pilot', 'first', 'rate', 'Highly', 'recommended']",Ironside - The Best of Season 1

Then when he started playing Ironside, she of course started to watch that show too.  In fact she had a big collection of his t.v. show's, but they were all on vhs tape's at the time.  Now, she has started to collect dvd's in the place of all her old show's that she used to watch.  I have already purchased a few of the Ironside series for her, and she continues to watch them from time to time in between her many other favorite t.v. show's she now has on dvd too.  She's really enjoying these old program's.

Saying that, Ironside is still much better than most of the shows on TV today (well, except for NCIS and Bones).
