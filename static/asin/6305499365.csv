This movie wisely focuses the tedious and mundane situations that occur in multiple offices today, delivering an amusing and realistic cast of characters.Ron Livingston plays the average mid-twenties guy who suddently gets terribly bored with his job and decides it`s time to call it it quits. This event will lead to some funny and interesting situations, making for an entertaining and true-to-life (even if a bit cartoonish) cinematic experience. Director Mike Judge, whose previous work includes MTV`s &quot;Beavis and Butthead&quot;, knows how to create a clever and intelligent movie with a lot of dead-on observations about the daily and mundane routines.Although &quot;Office Space&quot; displays a certain low-budget feel, the acting is very convincing and the characters are quite an achievement. Sure, this film hasn`t great camera tricks, a stunning photography or a superb soundrack, still it works well and stands as an above-average comedy. The comical approach is low-key, delivering subtle and ironic observations and avoiding the typical and predictable slapstick tendencies that are presented in most comedies today. It also shares a couple of similarities with the famous comic strip (and TV series) &quot;Dilbert&quot;, where one`s job is boring as hell.Generates some genuine laughs.",3,"Warning: If You Like Michael Bolton,  You Won`t Like This",1080950400,"04 3, 2004",2004,1474,"['pleasant', 'witty', 'surprise', 'quot', 'Office', 'Space', 'quot', 'offbeat', 'enticing', 'comedy', 'glimpse', 'boring', 'dull', 'predictable', 'corporate', 'world', 'movie', 'wisely', 'tedious', 'mundane', 'situations', 'occur', 'multiple', 'offices', 'today', 'delivering', 'amusing', 'realistic', 'cast', 'characters.Ron', 'Livingston', 'average', 'mid-twenties', 'guy', 'who', 'suddently', 'terribly', 'bored', 'job', 's', 'time', 'call', 'event', 'will', 'lead', 'funny', 'interesting', 'situations', 'making', 'entertaining', 'true-to-life', 'even', 'bit', 'cartoonish', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'Director', 'Mike', 'Judge', 'previous', 'work', 'MTV', 's', 'quot', 'Beavis', 'Butthead', 'quot', 'how', 'create', 'clever', 'intelligent', 'movie', 'lot', 'dead-on', 'observations', 'daily', 'mundane', 'routines.Although', 'quot', 'Office', 'Space', 'quot', 'certain', 'low-budget', 'feel', 'acting', 'very', 'convincing', 'characters', 'are', 'quite', 'achievement', 'Sure', 'film', 'hasn', 't', 'great', 'camera', 'tricks', 'stunning', 'photography', 'superb', 'soundrack', 'still', 'well', 'above-average', 'comedy', 'comical', 'approach', 'low-key', 'delivering', 'subtle', 'ironic', 'observations', 'avoiding', 'typical', 'predictable', 'slapstick', 'tendencies', 'are', 'presented', 'most', 'comedies', 'today', 'also', 'shares', 'couple', 'similarities', 'famous', 'comic', 'strip', 'TV', 'series', 'quot', 'Dilbert', 'quot', 'where', 'one', 's', 'job', 'boring', 'hell.Generates', 'genuine', 'laughs']",Office Space VHS

This movie is hilarious and should have been a huge commercial success.I don't even  remember when this movie hit the theaters, but one day at the video store I  heard a skateboard carrying teenager say to a fellow teen, &quot;Dude, this  movie is the funniest EVER! &quot;  Based on that ringing endorsement (and  even more based on the fact that there were only about 3 DVD available that  night) I grabbed it off the shelf.  I had very low expectations.  By the  end of the first half hour, I wanted to call the teen and tell him to get a  job as a movie reviewer.  This movie is one of the funniest EVER.  I  laughed so hard at some scenes, I had to rewind (is is still called  rewinding on DVD?) immediately to watch them again.Maybe it was the  unknown cast (other than Jennifer Aniston), or the lack of faith the studio  had in Mike Judge's ability to direct a live action movie, but this movie  got very little publicity.  What a mistake.  Although low brow at times, I  can't think of one person who will not laugh out loud at least five times  during this movie.  The cast is great and very funny.  There are a few  &quot;big&quot; names, like Aniston, Stephen Root, Steve Girardot and  Diedrich Bader, but it is the &quot;unknowns&quot; who make this flick  great.  Ron Livingston is great as the dissatisfied employee who decides he  is just not going to go to work anymore.  Every player seems to have a  funny line.  And, as other reviewers have pointed out, this movie has some  of the most quotable funny lines in movie history, which pushes this film  up to its five star status.Get a copy of this movie and enjoy.

There are a ton of people out there that experience the things parodied in this movie everyday. I for one, have fallen victim to the soulless corporations that bring in so called ""efficiency"" experts to ""clean house"".""Office Space"" depicts characters so accurately that it's scary. It starts off with everyone trying to make it to work on time on a Monday; first getting stuck in rush hour, then dealing with several self-righteous bosses, then having a chipper red head remind them that it's Monday before they settle into their cubicles for the day. Their is almost a deja vu effect for the people that have experienced these things. Ah yes, it's a depressing feeling knowing your wasting your life away in a cubicle updating bank records for the year 2000 switch; which is also a hilarious scenario in the film, since nothing happened to computer systems when the year 2000 hit. The characters in this movie make it great. Milton mumbling ""Have you seen my stapler?"" to Bill Lumbergh's manipulative soft spoken a-hole-of-a-boss character.Another thing that makes this movie hilarious is all the rap music that's played. It's not softcore rap at all. It is very explicit hardcore gangster rap in many cases. One scene in the film where they are smashing a printer that they have always hated in the middle of a field with a rap song chanting ""Die Mother Fu**a, Die Mother Fu**a, Die"" is one of the funniest ideas I've ever seen a in a film.I think everyone would find this film funny, even if you don't work in an office setting, but if you do, you will find it even funnier.",5,"Mike Judge, please make more movies.",1095292800,"09 16, 2004",2004,1616,"['satire', 'movie', 'brilliant', 'are', 'ton', 'people', 'there', 'experience', 'things', 'parodied', 'movie', 'everyday', 'one', 'have', 'fallen', 'victim', 'soulless', 'corporations', 'bring', 'so', 'called', 'efficiency', 'experts', 'clean', 'house', 'Office', 'Space', 'characters', 'so', 'accurately', 'scary', 'everyone', 'trying', 'make', 'work', 'time', 'Monday', 'first', 'getting', 'stuck', 'rush', 'hour', 'then', 'dealing', 'several', 'self-righteous', 'bosses', 'then', 'having', 'chipper', 'red', 'head', 'remind', 'Monday', 'settle', 'cubicles', 'day', 'Their', 'almost', 'deja', 'vu', 'effect', 'people', 'have', 'experienced', 'things', 'Ah', 'yes', 'depressing', 'feeling', 'knowing', 'wasting', 'life', 'away', 'cubicle', 'updating', 'bank', 'records', 'year', '2000', 'switch', 'also', 'hilarious', 'scenario', 'film', 'nothing', 'happened', 'computer', 'systems', 'when', 'year', '2000', 'hit', 'characters', 'movie', 'make', 'great', 'Milton', 'mumbling', 'Have', 'seen', 'stapler', 'Bill', 'Lumbergh', 'manipulative', 'soft', 'spoken', 'a-hole-of-a-boss', 'character.Another', 'thing', 'movie', 'hilarious', 'rap', 'music', 'played', 'not', 'softcore', 'rap', 'very', 'explicit', 'hardcore', 'gangster', 'rap', 'many', 'cases', 'One', 'scene', 'film', 'where', 'are', 'smashing', 'printer', 'have', 'always', 'hated', 'middle', 'field', 'rap', 'song', 'chanting', 'Die', 'Mother', 'Fu**a', 'Die', 'Mother', 'Fu**a', 'Die', 'one', 'funniest', 'ideas', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'film.I', 'think', 'everyone', 'would', 'find', 'film', 'funny', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'office', 'setting', 'do', 'will', 'find', 'even', 'funnier']",Office Space VHS

467247,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6305499365,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","In my circle of friends there is no film quoted, referenced or talked about as much as `Office Space'.  It is the collective favorite; the one film we can all agree on to have entertained us in every way possible.  Not a week goes by that this film is not mentioned among us and not once do we pass up an opportunity to watch this movie, even if only in part.  For instance, this film has been in rotation on Comedy Central for the past few months and in those past few months my best friend and I have watched this movie, in whole or in part, at least twelve times.Why?It's that good.`Office Space' is truly one of the richest comedies I've ever seen.  From the very start to the very end it delivers laugh after laugh, each as genuine as the one preceding.  That I think is the kicker.  Each joke, each gag, each laugh is just as purely entertaining as the last one, none of them fall south or feeling forced.  Each scenario is so real and so relatable that it all becomes all the more hilarious because we feel as though we've been here before.  Who hasn't had the condescending and overbearing boss who just can't seem to take a hint?  Who hasn't had the obsessive compulsive co-working who can't seem to get out of your way?  Who hasn't had that one pesky piece of office equipment that just won't seem to work right?  Who hasn't had that overachieving co-working that just won't seem to get out from under your skin?The point is that `Office Space' could be re-titled `Your Life' in the essence that it is so real and down to earth.  Sure, parts are exaggerated, but are they really?The story revolves around Peter Gibbons, a man who loathes his little cubicle of an office space at his horror show of a job and only wants to be free of the responsibilities of adulthood.  His girlfriend is obviously cheating on him and wants for him to grow up.  His friends all hate their jobs as much as he does but like Peter are too chicken to take any action about it.  This is all until Bob Slydell is hired to evaluate who is really pulling their weight within the company and start making some cut-backs.  This all happens just about the time that Peter is hypnotized and placed under a spell of serenity.  While his friends Samir and Michael are fretting over losing their job Peter is slacking off, showing up late (if at all) and doing his best to upset his boss Mr. Lumbergh.  Then the three friends concoct a plan to end their worrying forever, but of course it's going to backfire.Ron Livingston is brilliantly cast as Peter.  His laid back portrayal of Peter is marvelous.  Ajay Naidu does wonderful things with Samir, but it's David Herman that steals this entire film with his neurotic and aggressive portrayal of Michael Bolton (yup, you heard me right).  Supporting parts played by Jennifer Aniston, Diedrich Bader and Gary Cole are sure to entertain and leave an impression and of course Stephen Roots portrayal of Milton is sure to elicit plenty of laughs.What is really great about `Office Space' is that it's not just out there to bash corporate America but in actuality it attacks the work environment in general.  Sure Peter and his corporate business woes are prominent here but we are introduced to Joanna, Peters love interest, and her struggle with her waitressing job at Chotchkie's, a restaurant chain in the vein of TGI Fridays.  As she battles with her boss obsessed with `flair' and being compared to her co-worker obsessed with kissing up and being teachers-pet so-to-speak we see the ugly side of the workplace from a whole different perspective.  It's such a well rounded comedy that you can't help but appreciate the irony.I can't think of enough good things to say about this hilarious satire.  All I can say is see this movie again and again for optimum enjoyment and laugh your butt off.  You deserve it.  You work all week long and have little to show for it.  It's about time you embrace your own misery and find all the humor there is to find in your puppet dance for the man.",5,Filled to the brim with flair; this is hilarity at its finest...,1201219200,"01 25, 2008",2008,4011,"['circle', 'friends', 'film', 'quoted', 'referenced', 'talked', 'as', 'much', 'Office', 'Space', 'collective', 'favorite', 'one', 'film', 'can', 'agree', 'have', 'entertained', 'way', 'possible', 'Not', 'week', 'film', 'not', 'mentioned', 'not', 'once', 'do', 'pass', 'up', 'opportunity', 'watch', 'movie', 'even', 'only', 'part', 'instance', 'film', 'been', 'rotation', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'past', 'few', 'months', 'past', 'few', 'months', 'best', 'friend', 'have', 'watched', 'movie', 'whole', 'part', 'least', 'twelve', 'times.Why', 'good.', 'Office', 'Space', 'truly', 'one', 'richest', 'comedies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'very', 'start', 'very', 'end', 'laugh', 'as', 'genuine', 'one', 'preceding', 'think', 'kicker', 'joke', 'gag', 'laugh', 'just', 'purely', 'entertaining', 'last', 'one', 'none', 'fall', 'south', 'feeling', 'forced', 'scenario', 'so', 'real', 'so', 'relatable', 'more', 'hilarious', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'been', 'here', 'before', 'Who', ""n't"", 'had', 'condescending', 'overbearing', 'boss', 'who', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'take', 'hint', 'Who', ""n't"", 'had', 'obsessive', 'compulsive', 'co-working', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'way', 'Who', ""n't"", 'had', 'one', 'pesky', 'piece', 'office', 'equipment', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'seem', 'work', 'right', 'Who', ""n't"", 'had', 'overachieving', 'co-working', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'out', 'skin', 'point', 'Office', 'Space', 'could', 'be', 're-titled', 'Life', 'essence', 'so', 'real', 'down', 'earth', 'Sure', 'parts', 'are', 'exaggerated', 'are', 'really', 'story', 'around', 'Peter', 'Gibbons', 'man', 'who', 'little', 'cubicle', 'office', 'space', 'horror', 'show', 'job', 'only', 'be', 'free', 'responsibilities', 'adulthood', 'girlfriend', 'obviously', 'cheating', 'grow', 'up', 'friends', 'hate', 'jobs', 'as', 'much', 'Peter', 'are', 'too', 'chicken', 'take', 'action', 'Bob', 'Slydell', 'hired', 'evaluate', 'who', 'really', 'pulling', 'weight', 'company', 'start', 'making', 'cut-backs', 'just', 'time', 'Peter', 'hypnotized', 'placed', 'spell', 'serenity', 'friends', 'Samir', 'Michael', 'are', 'fretting', 'losing', 'job', 'Peter', 'slacking', 'off', 'showing', 'up', 'late', 'doing', 'best', 'upset', 'boss', 'Mr.', 'Lumbergh', 'Then', 'three', 'friends', 'concoct', 'plan', 'end', 'worrying', 'forever', 'course', 'going', 'backfire.Ron', 'Livingston', 'brilliantly', 'cast', 'Peter', 'laid', 'back', 'portrayal', 'Peter', 'marvelous', 'Ajay', 'Naidu', 'wonderful', 'things', 'Samir', 'David', 'Herman', 'entire', 'film', 'neurotic', 'aggressive', 'portrayal', 'Michael', 'Bolton', 'yup', 'heard', 'right', 'Supporting', 'parts', 'played', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Diedrich', 'Bader', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'are', 'sure', 'entertain', 'leave', 'impression', 'course', 'Stephen', 'Roots', 'portrayal', 'Milton', 'sure', 'elicit', 'plenty', 'laughs.What', 'really', 'great', 'Office', 'Space', 'not', 'just', 'out', 'there', 'bash', 'corporate', 'America', 'actuality', 'work', 'environment', 'general', 'Sure', 'Peter', 'corporate', 'business', 'woes', 'are', 'prominent', 'here', 'are', 'introduced', 'Joanna', 'Peters', 'love', 'interest', 'struggle', 'waitressing', 'job', 'Chotchkie', 'restaurant', 'chain', 'vein', 'TGI', 'Fridays', 'boss', 'obsessed', 'flair', 'being', 'compared', 'co-worker', 'obsessed', 'kissing', 'up', 'being', 'teachers-pet', 'so-to-speak', 'see', 'ugly', 'side', 'workplace', 'whole', 'different', 'perspective', 'such', 'well', 'rounded', 'comedy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'appreciate', 'irony.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'enough', 'good', 'things', 'say', 'hilarious', 'satire', 'can', 'say', 'see', 'movie', 'again', 'again', 'optimum', 'enjoyment', 'butt', 'off', 'deserve', 'work', 'week', 'long', 'have', 'little', 'show', 'time', 'embrace', 'own', 'misery', 'find', 'humor', 'find', 'puppet', 'dance', 'man']",Office Space VHS

I laughed harder than I've laughed at a movie in years. I laughed because it's dark and raw and cynically funny, not because it's what passes for comedy these days (raunchy sex and language that would make a sailor blush--though that can be funny too; see JAY AND SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK for a great example).Mike Judge (of BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD and KING OF THE HILL fame) brings to life a Dilbert-esque fantasy through the eyes of everyman Peter Gibbons, cube farm dot-com slave working on fixing the Y2K problem and hating every moment of his miserable work existence. He's got eight bosses (one of whom is played by Gary Cole in a performance so magnificent that you will wonder if he shadowed your boss for a few days to get acting tips--he's that realistic), all of whom jump his case whenever he makes mistakes. He's surrounded by the lady with the annoying voice, co-workers cursing at a broken fax machine, the old timer who sees layoffs around every corner...and Milton, the weird guy we've all seen in our offices, the mumbler, the nervous wreck, the guy we all take bets on when he'll snap and go postal. A visit to a hypnotherapist turns Peter's life around, and he stops caring about his job...just as two efficiency consultants arrive to review company practices and procedures. But instead of getting fired, Peter gets a promotion while his two best friends get fired, and the three of them plot to take their revenge on the nameless, faceless corporation making their lives miserable.Look for Jennifer Aniston in a very nice small role as a waitress at a TGIFriday-esque restaurant who becomes Peter's girlfriend and learns to stand up for herself at her job. Look fast or you'll miss Orlando (7-Up) Jones in a bit part that is so funny and so real that you'll wonder how long he studied those guys who go door-to-door with the magazine subscriptions. But most of all, look at the atmosphere of this film and marvel at how eerily accurate it is. They say you know your job stinks when you think of Dilbert as more autobiographical than funny; your job is really terrible when you can spot your office in OFFICE SPACE.

It limped into what appeared to be oblivion after six scant weeks.  Except for one small thing......in DVD/home video-land, 'Office Space' became a cultural phenomenon.  As one reviewer notes, Mike Judge's workplace masterpiece ""promptly broke every video record in Fox history.""  And eight years after its release it continues to be a phenomenon.

Even though I haven't worked in the USA for years and years, the years I have I can so relate to this film. When it first came out I loved it and now I use words like genius to describe it. Captures both the cooperate culture and chain restaurant industry so well it's almost scary.The story follows a group of people working at the lower corporate level a tech firm in the 90's. I just so happened to work for tech firms in the 90's and although all of them weren't like this, the majority were. But as long as you have worked at any business in the corporate office level you will get a kick out of this film. It covers all the normal office politics, annoying office mates, type A personalities, horrible upper management, worker bees and everyone else you will find in this environment.The main characters are a low lever programmer and his work mates. The main antagonist is of course the boss and his minions but its more a statement of a man exploring his place in life and where he really would like to be. And surprisingly his desire is not to be rich and powerful but just in a position to enjoy life at his own pace.There is also a peripheral character who works as a waitress at a chain restaurant similar to TGI Friday's or Applebee's. Anyone who has ever worked in the restaurant industry will really appreciate this story line and the truths it reveals through her tormentuous struggle.  Just brilliant!Also, I have to comment briefly on this version the Bluray, ""with Flair"" edition. Even a film of this calibre benefits from such a beautiful picture. They did a very nice transfer.I am not one of those people who like the commentary on most of these types of things but Mike Judge and the rest of the cast did a nice modern update for this edition and it was neither too long or self promoting. I really enjoyed it.And lastly, the deleted scenes were really funny!Great Friday night film.

Mike Judge(King Of The Hill), wrote and directed this hilarious look at the mundane life of office workers. Peter(Ron Livingston) has a boring life. He lives in a plain, by the numbers apartment with an odd neighbor(Diedrich Bader from ""The Drew Carey Show""), and works in front of a computer all day in a small cubicle. It's the same rut day in and day out. He has a smarmy boss with an very slow, annoying way of speech named Bill Lumberg(Played by the awesome Gary Cole). This guy is pricelessly funny. Many points go to Mr. Cole. He also, in a very funny joke, has a friend that works there named Michael Bolton. Don't think there's not many jokes there!. The company then begins to downsize and Peter's two best friends are on that list, while he is to be promoted. The three guys then set out for revenge and devise a plan to launder funds from company accounts. All seems to be golden, when something goes horribly wrong and the guys scramble to find a solution to save their butts!. Jennifer Aniston also co-stars(and looking cute as ever) as Peter's waitress girlfriend. Stephen Root from ""NewsRadio"" co-stars as Milton, a highly geeky loser who never gets the attention or respect at work. Like Cole, his comedic performance is incredibly funny. The ending kinda just happens real quickly, and one wishes it was a bit longer and more fleshed out. We've come this far!. The movie has many laugh out loud moments that are both hysterical and oh so true!. Who doesn't hate their job, right?. The film hits the bullseye on that front. It's a shame this intelligent film didn't get the recognition it deserved. It is definitley finding a voice on cable and video. Good. If your looking for a fun little movie that you may of missed, this is the movie for you!. As Bill Lumberg himself might say, ' I want you to see this movie, m'kaaaayyy?. Riiiggghhhttt. Teriffic'.

Written and directed by Judge with wit, realism and spot on observations this film about the everyday work place truly stands the test of time.  It inded deserves the cult following it has acquired and reigns in a class all its own as it satirizes the American worker so perfectly.  The story has a purpose but also provides laughs from beginning to end that often turn into side splitting belly laughs.  The entire cast is excellent with Ron Livingston, Stephen Root and Gary Cole in particular reigning supreme.  Livingston shines and makes the whole story line seem very plausible and helps the viewer care for all the characters.  And it is so much fun to see an early Jennifer Anniston and you will never forget her dealing with her flair after this film.Blu ray is indeed a magic worker and this film looks excellent on blu ray.  The video is crisp, clear, bright with colors that pop and realistic flesh tones.  Black/white ratio is superb and it is the added clarity that tuly brings this film to a new dimension.  The audio is also excellent.  This is a dialogue driven film and it is always crisp and clear.  When music is present it comes out of the surround speakers pefectly never overshadowing the dialogue.  The entire film comes to new life on blu ray.  If you love this film and own the dvd double dipping for the blu ray is a must.  The viewing experience is truly superior to the dvd.

This is possibly one of the greatest comedies to come out during the turn of centuries.Basically, the scene of this movie is in the everyday workspace, with a small cubicle and pure boredom. Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) is getting really tired of it, so with the help of buddy Samir and Michael Bolton (no, not the no talent assclown Michael Bolton), they basically try to do whatever it takes to screw Initech over. From Peter removing a wall from his cubicle to transmitting a virus throughout Initech's network, they want to cause their boss Bill Lumbergh (Gary Cole) trouble.Another important character to this movie is Milton Waddams (Stephen Root). He has had his desk moved 4 times and his red Swingline stapler taken, plus he never receives any more paychecks. When he doesn't receive any of Lumbergh's birthday cake and he is moved downstairs to storage B, he threatens to set the building on fire.Other important qualities to this classic movie include Peter dating waitress Joanna (Jennifer Aniston), who hates her job because she ""doesn't wear enough flair"", and Peter's blue-collar nextdoor apartment mate, Lawrence.Oh yeah, also, you have the unforgettable fax machine destruction sequence, when Michael Bolton is just furious and wants to destroy that thing.

Arguably the best work-related comedy ever written, Office Space follows the life of Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston), a computer programmer in his late-20's who hates his mind-numbing job at Initech Corporation where he updates bank software for the year 2000 switch.Peter is joined by fellow computer programmers Samir Nagheenanajar (Ajay Naidu) and Michael Bolton (David Herman). All four men are plagued by the condescending, soul-killing management techniques of their boss, Bill Lumbergh (Gary Cole) who begins every utterance with a protracted ""Yeah..."" Completely unhappy with his job and his romantic relationship, Peter whines about his life with his co-workers while drinking coffee at local restaurant, Chotchkie's, where he's infatuated with a beautiful waitress, Joanna (Jennifer Aniston), who is forced by her boss to wear ""pieces of flair"". Samir and Michael encourage Peter to ask her out, but Peter is too paralyzed by life to do anything about it.All that changes, however, when Peter visits a hypnotherapist with his girlfriend. In the act of sending Peter into a state of total relaxation, the hypnotherapist suffers a heart attack. His untimely death leaves Peter in a perpetual state of relaxation, providing his life with a much needed injection of enjoyment. The next morning, Peter sleeps through work, dumps his girlfriend, then goes and asks Joanna out to lunch. Peter and Joanna hit it off, and he reveals to her that he's simply going to stop going to work.After a good week or so of neglecting his job, two independent consultants - Bob Slydell (John McGinley) and Bob Porter (Paul Willson) - reveal to Peter that he's being promoted to the upper ranks of management. Meanwhile, his studious co-workers Samir and Michael are slated to be canned. Armed with this insider information, Peter approaches Michael about concocting a previously mentioned computer program to take the remainders of every bank transaction at Initech and funnel them into a private account owed by Peter, Samir, and Michael. Michael is reluctant until he finds out that he's going to be fired.As the two set out to convince Samir that their plan will work, resident office weirdo Milton Waddams (Stephen Root) is in the process of having his paycheck stopped by the consultants who uncover the fact that Milton was fired several years earlier but is still being paid. When Bill Lumbergh moves Milton's desk into the basement, he whispers that he will set the place on fire.Meanwhile, long-time corporate cog Tom Smykowski (Richard Riehle) experiences the dream of a lifetime when he's badly injured by a drunk driver. Fresh off a seven-figure settlement, and in possession of his prototype ""jump to conclusions mat,"" Tom tells Peter to hang in there, that life has a lot of good things in store for those who wait. While attending a party for Tom, Samir and Michael grow nervous when Tom's lawyer reveals that white collar criminals go to federal ""pound-me-in-the-ass"" prison where they better ""beat someone up or become someone's bitch"" on the first day.Office Space is one laugh after another, and the heroes' nefarious plan works surprisingly well until it hits a glitch. When the scheme devised by Peter, Michael, and Samir goes up in smoke, Milton decides to create some smoke of his own...The brainchild of King of the Hill and Beavis & Butthead creator Mike Judge, Office Space will leave you in absolute stitches. Funny from beginning to end, with a plot mysteriously similar to Superman 3, this is one movie that anyone who's ever worked a job from hell (and haven't we all?) needs to see at least once.

467274,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,6305499365,calvinnme,"[4, 4]","Office Space highlights the absurdities of the modern day workplace, and the high tech workplace specifically. Everyone at computer software company ""Initech"" hates their jobs, especially Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) who feels trapped in a treadmill of nonrewarding monotonous work as he rewrites and tests other people's software to insure it is Y2K compliant. Simultaneously, he feels equally trapped in a relationship with a woman who treats him like an unsatisfactory employee. Peter represents all of the 25-35 year old white collar workers who know they are not doing what they want to with their lives but simply find initiating a complete career change as too scary, as if anything could be worse than what they are putting up with already.I'm positive that someone involved with this movie has a deep understanding of working in software, because I easily recognized each of the various types of people represented in the cast - even the psychotic coworker, Milton, who keeps coming to work when they move his desk to the basement and stop paying him. Gary Cole's performance of Bill Lundburg hits the bullseye as the boss that understates in a calm voice everything that he wants, but then has no problem firing people if they don't meet his understated demands. What seems like a post-it note is actually a subpoena, in Lundburg's eyes. One of my favorite scenes is when he is having everyone come in and basically beg for their jobs by justifying their positions. One older worker only seems to have one function - to carry the requirements from the requirements writers to the software engineers. When the bosses try to probe more deeply into his skills he gets angry and bellows ""Are you blind! Can't you people see I have valuable people skills!"".Ultimately, Peter and his coworkers bungle a scheme to embezzle from the company by writing a program that extracts fractions of pennies per iteration. Instead of producing many very small checks, the program winds up producing one huge check that is bound to attract attention. Thus Peter goes to Initech to return the check.

There boss Lumbergh (Gary Cole) is a complete pain in the @$$ and Milton (Stephen Root) is well, weird.  (Actually Milton's subplot involving his employment - or lack there of - and his stapler serve as some of the funniest scenes in this film)  Peter's girlfriend Anne left him and he's trying to hook up with Joanne (Aniston) who is waitress at a local 'bennigans' type resterant.  When they finally get fed up with their situation they decide to take action and come up with a scam to rip off the company.  Hilarity ensues as their plan backfires.  David Herman serves as the funniest person here, with his pure hatred for the singer Michael Bolton and life in general.  Diedrich Bader plays Peter's hilarious hillbilly neighbor.

467292,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,6305499365,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[2, 3]","Now, Office Space might look like a movie about this young guy whose whole viewpoint on cubicle hell is changed when his occupational hypnotherapist dies in the middle of a hypnosis session, leaving him with a wonderfully carefree attitude toward the job he despises - but it's not.  The real star of this movie is Milton Waddams (Stephen Root), the mumbling, thoroughly mistreated oddball who is pushed beyond his limits after the boss, among other things, steals his stapler.  He really loved that stapler, which is why he continued to use it after the company went with a completely different stapler manufacturer.  When you're stuck in a cubicle for forty hours a week and forced to watch all sorts of Who Stole My Cheese nonsense taking place all around you, when you're always the odd man out when the boss' yearly birthday cake gets handed out, when you're forced to change cubicles over and over again for no good reason whatsoever, you become Milton.  With no control over your life's direction, you cling to any little thing you can find in your three-walled domain - a favorite stapler, your chair (which you really should put your name on, if you want to make sure someone doesn't pull the old switcheroo on you), and the all-consuming importance of locks for your shelves (which the movie completely leaves out, for some reason).  Your bosses make fun of you behind your back and think of ways to make your life even more miserable, and you start mumbling all the time.  Yes, Milton truly represents those unfortunate enough to be trapped inside cubicle farms.However, since the movie does give young Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) and his buddies most of the screen time, I'll talk about them as well.  That Pete's really got his head on straight as the movie begins; he has already learned that work is a form of torture that makes every day worse than the one before until you get old and die.  His buddies at work are pretty spot-on as well, knowing that the hiring of a consultant means a labor reduction is imminent.  Then Peter sees this hypnotherapist who gets him nice and relaxed, with all of his work-related worries washed away - and keels over dead, leaving Peter in a state that can only be described as carefree.  He just stops going to work for awhile, but when he does pop in (just to pick up his address book), he goes ahead and talks to the two Bobs (the consultants).  His straight-shooting, incredibly honest answers about how little he actually does at the company convince the Bobs that he is upper management material.  While Peter's being promoted, though, his buddies Michael Bolton (David Herman) - no, he's not related to that dreadful singer - and Samir  Nagheenanajar (Ajay Naidu) are being laid off.  That's when Peter comes up with a plan - well, actually, the whole idea was Michael's, but Peter talks him and Samir into actually doing it.  They plant a virus-type routine, designed to skim off a fraction of a cent from every transaction, inside the computer system.  The plan ends up working too well, though, putting Peter and the guys into quite a potential pickle.I think the film sort of loses its focus during the final half hour.  Up until that point, it's a dead-on parody of cubicle life.  You've got your fax machine designed to jam as often as possible, your boss who speaks to you as if you're intellectually challenged and never hears a word you say, a  whole range of annoying co-workers, etc..  The whole ""Didn't you get the memo?"" routine captures the very essence of life in the cubicle jungle.  A great supporting cast, including Jennifer Aniston as Joanna, a waitress who just says no to ""flair,"" and Diedrich Bader as Peter's next-door-neighbor, really round out the film remarkably well.  Even the genius behind the whole film, Mike Judge, joins the fun as Joanna's flair-obsessed manager.  Office Space is just a tremendously funny movie that shines the mirror of hilarious truth on the ridiculous nature of far too many modern companies.",5,Office Space goes where Dilbert fears to tread,1138406400,"01 28, 2006",2006,4007,"['Now', 'Office', 'Space', 'might', 'look', 'movie', 'young', 'guy', 'whole', 'viewpoint', 'cubicle', 'hell', 'changed', 'when', 'occupational', 'hypnotherapist', 'dies', 'middle', 'hypnosis', 'session', 'leaving', 'wonderfully', 'carefree', 'attitude', 'job', 'not', 'real', 'star', 'movie', 'Milton', 'Waddams', 'Stephen', 'Root', 'mumbling', 'thoroughly', 'mistreated', 'oddball', 'who', 'pushed', 'limits', 'boss', 'other', 'things', 'steals', 'stapler', 'really', 'loved', 'stapler', 'why', 'continued', 'use', 'company', 'went', 'completely', 'different', 'stapler', 'manufacturer', 'When', ""'re"", 'stuck', 'cubicle', 'forty', 'hours', 'week', 'forced', 'watch', 'sorts', 'Who', 'Stole', 'My', 'Cheese', 'nonsense', 'taking', 'place', 'when', ""'re"", 'always', 'odd', 'man', 'when', 'boss', 'yearly', 'birthday', 'cake', 'handed', 'out', 'when', ""'re"", 'forced', 'change', 'cubicles', 'over', 'again', 'good', 'reason', 'whatsoever', 'become', 'Milton', 'control', 'life', 'direction', 'cling', 'little', 'thing', 'can', 'find', 'three-walled', 'domain', 'favorite', 'stapler', 'chair', 'really', 'should', 'put', 'name', 'want', 'make', 'sure', 'someone', ""n't"", 'pull', 'old', 'switcheroo', 'all-consuming', 'importance', 'locks', 'shelves', 'movie', 'completely', 'out', 'reason', 'bosses', 'make', 'fun', 'back', 'think', 'ways', 'make', 'life', 'even', 'more', 'miserable', 'start', 'mumbling', 'time', 'Yes', 'Milton', 'truly', 'unfortunate', 'enough', 'be', 'trapped', 'cubicle', 'farms.However', 'movie', 'give', 'young', 'Peter', 'Gibbons', 'Ron', 'Livingston', 'buddies', 'most', 'screen', 'time', ""'ll"", 'talk', 'about', 'as', 'well', 'Pete', 'really', 'got', 'head', 'straight', 'movie', 'already', 'learned', 'work', 'form', 'torture', 'day', 'worse', 'one', 'get', 'old', 'die', 'buddies', 'work', 'are', 'pretty', 'spot-on', 'well', 'knowing', 'hiring', 'consultant', 'labor', 'reduction', 'imminent', 'Then', 'Peter', 'hypnotherapist', 'who', 'nice', 'relaxed', 'work-related', 'worries', 'washed', 'away', 'keels', 'dead', 'leaving', 'Peter', 'state', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'carefree', 'just', 'going', 'work', 'awhile', 'when', 'pop', 'just', 'pick', 'up', 'address', 'book', 'ahead', 'talks', 'two', 'Bobs', 'consultants', 'straight-shooting', 'incredibly', 'honest', 'answers', 'how', 'little', 'actually', 'company', 'convince', 'Bobs', 'upper', 'management', 'material', 'Peter', 'being', 'promoted', 'buddies', 'Michael', 'Bolton', 'David', 'Herman', 'not', 'related', 'dreadful', 'singer', 'Samir', 'Nagheenanajar', 'Ajay', 'Naidu', 'are', 'being', 'laid', 'off', 'when', 'Peter', 'up', 'plan', 'well', 'actually', 'whole', 'idea', 'was', 'Michael', 'Peter', 'talks', 'Samir', 'actually', 'doing', 'plant', 'virus-type', 'routine', 'designed', 'skim', 'off', 'fraction', 'cent', 'transaction', 'computer', 'system', 'plan', 'up', 'working', 'too', 'well', 'though', 'putting', 'Peter', 'guys', 'quite', 'potential', 'pickle.I', 'think', 'film', 'sort', 'focus', 'final', 'half', 'hour', 'point', 'dead-on', 'parody', 'cubicle', 'life', ""'ve"", 'got', 'fax', 'machine', 'designed', 'jam', 'as', 'often', 'possible', 'boss', 'who', ""'re"", 'intellectually', 'challenged', 'never', 'word', 'say', 'whole', 'range', 'annoying', 'co-workers', 'etc..', 'whole', 'Did', ""n't"", 'get', 'memo', 'routine', 'very', 'essence', 'life', 'cubicle', 'jungle', 'great', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Joanna', 'waitress', 'who', 'just', 'flair', 'Diedrich', 'Bader', 'Peter', 'next-door-neighbor', 'really', 'round', 'out', 'film', 'remarkably', 'well', 'Even', 'genius', 'whole', 'film', 'Mike', 'Judge', 'fun', 'Joanna', 'flair-obsessed', 'manager', 'Office', 'Space', 'just', 'tremendously', 'funny', 'movie', 'mirror', 'hilarious', 'truth', 'ridiculous', 'nature', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'modern', 'companies']",Office Space VHS

Not only does ""Office Space"" stand out as a great comedy for those starved of great comedy, but manages to hit closer with those actually victimized by white-collar occupations. It's suprising how this evolved from a series of cheaply-made animated shorts, starring the squirrely stapler-obsessed Milton, and into an underestimated masterpiece.Some would say that a comedy doesn't really require top-notch acting to get its hilarity across, but ""Office Space"" is a grand exception.

I firmly believe that anyone who has ever worked in an office cubical situation or in food service (and I have done both) will be able to appreciate every bit of the humor presented. This was one of those small-time movies that just popped up out of nowhere and has managed to climb the cult movie ranks.Based on the comic strip Milton by Mike Judge (creator of Beavis and Butthead) Office Space goes the extra length to take pretty much every stereotype in the book and magnify it to the umpteenth degree. Imagine every weird coworker you've ever encountered...every cubical you've ever worked in...every boss you've wanted to strangle, put them in a company called Initech, and then move them all to The Far Side and you might just have an idea of what this movie is all about.The main character in the film isn't Milton, however, as the comic strip title would suggest. Instead it's a guy named Peter (played by Ron Livingston). Milton is in the film and adds a really humorous (but also sad) dimension to the movie (there is a certain level of morbid humor throughout). Stephen Root (who up until this movie, had been best known for his character Jimmy James on News Radio) plays Milton and really gave the best performance overall.There is an underlying plot line, in case you were wondering. The company (Initech) calls for a couple of consultants, known as ""Efficiency Experts"" to come in and do a little--shall we say (with air quotes)--`housecleaning'. As one insane plot builds on another, the Efficiency Experts promote Peter, but fire two of his fellow cubical-mates so they all begin scheming together to find a way to rip off their evil and incredibly patronizing boss, Lumburgh (played by Gary Cole).Offices are not always fun environments to work in, but thanks to them, movies like this one can be made.",5,Best work cult film...EVER,1359590400,"01 31, 2013",2013,1963,"['word', 'HYSTERICAL', 'remember', 'seeing', 'first', 'time', 'theater', 'laughed', 'so', 'hard', 'almost', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', 'dialogue', 'firmly', 'believe', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'worked', 'office', 'cubical', 'situation', 'food', 'service', 'have', 'done', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'appreciate', 'bit', 'humor', 'presented', 'was', 'one', 'small-time', 'movies', 'just', 'popped', 'up', 'nowhere', 'managed', 'climb', 'cult', 'movie', 'ranks.Based', 'comic', 'strip', 'Milton', 'Mike', 'Judge', 'creator', 'Beavis', 'Butthead', 'Office', 'Space', 'extra', 'length', 'take', 'pretty', 'much', 'stereotype', 'book', 'magnify', 'umpteenth', 'degree', 'Imagine', 'weird', 'coworker', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'encountered', 'cubical', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'worked', ""'ve"", 'wanted', 'strangle', 'put', 'company', 'called', 'Initech', 'then', 'move', 'Far', 'Side', 'might', 'just', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'movie', 'about.The', 'main', 'character', 'film', ""n't"", 'Milton', 'however', 'comic', 'strip', 'title', 'would', 'suggest', 'Instead', 'guy', 'named', 'Peter', 'played', 'Ron', 'Livingston', 'Milton', 'film', 'really', 'humorous', 'also', 'sad', 'dimension', 'movie', 'certain', 'level', 'morbid', 'humor', 'Stephen', 'Root', 'who', 'up', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'best', 'known', 'character', 'Jimmy', 'James', 'News', 'Radio', 'Milton', 'really', 'gave', 'best', 'performance', 'underlying', 'plot', 'line', 'case', 'were', 'wondering', 'company', 'Initech', 'couple', 'consultants', 'known', 'Efficiency', 'Experts', 'come', 'do', 'little', 'shall', 'say', 'air', 'quotes', 'housecleaning', 'one', 'insane', 'plot', 'builds', 'Efficiency', 'Experts', 'promote', 'Peter', 'fire', 'two', 'fellow', 'cubical-mates', 'begin', 'scheming', 'together', 'find', 'way', 'rip', 'off', 'evil', 'incredibly', 'patronizing', 'boss', 'Lumburgh', 'played', 'Gary', 'Cole', '.Offices', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'fun', 'environments', 'work', 'thanks', 'movies', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'made']",Office Space VHS

When the session goes awry, Peter is left locked into a relaxed mode that allows him to cheerfully skip work, chase the girl of his dreams, and subvert the routine of his office.  A consulting team brought in to downside the company becomes the trigger for a fraud scheme hatched by Peter and two disgruntled office mates.  They spring the scheme, only to suffer an attack of conscience (and a fear of jail).  Their ham-handed  attempts to fix things lead to a fateful decision by Peter.The comedy of ""Office Space"" is in the knowing details, such as Peter's wearisome commute, in which the other lane always moves faster; the office gnome, laid off five years ago but still shuttling from desk to desk because no one told him; and a perpetually malfunctioning printer.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","If they ever decided to make a live-action ""Dilbert"" movie, it might resemble ""Office Space.""There's a lot of the same bitter surreality infused in this hysterically funny office film by Mike Judge (of ""Beavis & Butthead"" fame), all about three rebellious office employees who have finally had enough. Filled with quirky characters and a hilarious employee rebellion, this is a movie for anyone who ever felt trapped in a soul-destroying job. Which is just about everybody.Peter (Ron Livingston) spends every day in a cubicle, doing pointless work under the thumb of his smarmy boss Bill Lumbergh (Gary Cole). His life is boring, and he doesn't even have the confidence to tell a waitress (Jennifer Aniston) that he likes her.Because layoffs are impending, Peter accompanies his controlling girlfriend to a hypnosis session, and is instructed to relax. Unfortunately, the hypnotist dies of a heart attack... while Peter is still under his hypnotic influence. And nobody snaps him out of it. The next morning, Peter wakes up happy and laid-back -- and determined to get out of his rotten job, and live fat and happy.He conspires with fiery Samir Nagheenanajar (Ajay Naidu) and the ill-named Michael Bolton (David Herman) -- two coworkers who are about to be axed -- to skim money off the company's assets with a secret computer virus. Only problem is, their scene is rapidly spinning out of control when the virus goes glitchy haywire -- and their scheme is threatened with exposure.""Office Space"" started off as an early 90s animated skit, featuring the character of Milton. You know, that increasingly deranged employee who complains that ""you took my stapler."" This time, Milton is a minor character, although a pivotal one. The focus is mainly on the mellowed-out Peter and his wild scheme to profit the downtrodden employees of Initech -- sort of like a crazier version of ""The Office.""And Judge knows how to wring all the bitter comedy from this scenario. He creates a hysterical tangle of cubicle workers, layoffs and the most annoying boss in the history of film (""Yeeeeeeaaaahhhh... uhhhhhhh...""). There's a less interesting subplot about Peter's unstable relationship with the equally POed-about-her-job waitress, but the real draw here is all the corporate cheating and craziness.This brand of humor is twisted, down to the slow-motion, ghetto-style beating of the copier in the middle of a field, and Peter receiving a raise because he no longer cares if he gets fired. And of course, the dialogue is quietly insane (""Oh, and next Friday... is Hawaiian shirt day..."") as the plot grows grows more and more tense... until you know someone has to snap. You can see who it is way in advance, but it's no less hilarious when it happens -- with disastrous consequences.The trio of lead characters are a riot -- there's Peter, whose newfound perspective about what is important in life is immensely entertaining. There's Samir, who can barely restrain his simmering rage at his rotten job, or his deep hatred for the copier. And there's Michael, who has a seething resentment that he has the same name as THAT sappy singer. As for Cole, he's utterly brilliant as a boss who is as endearing and appealing as a rake on a chalkboard.""Office Space"" has become something of a deserving cult classic -- funny, strange, and sympathetic to the ants that toil in their cubicles.

I didn't see the movie until this past year and that was when I started to appreciate this movie. I work for a huge mortgage company which basically I would not recommend taking out a loan with given the way they treat their customers which is horrible, not to mention their employees too. What I see in ""Office Space"" is basically a mirror image of the BS I have to suffer at the office on a daily basis. Mike Judge (creator of ""Beavis and Butthead"") really captures cubical life in ""Office Space"". Ron Livingston is hilarious as Peter Gibbons who begins out in the movie stressing out about everything that is going on at his job but after he is hypnotized (which eventually goes awry), Peter stops giving a darn about his job and starts slouching off. Yet that lazy, sloth mentality of Peter's manages to get him far ahead in the company while other people are being screwed over by the company (which I can definitely relate to). Gary Cole is hilarious as the patronizing, condescending jerk of a boss. His line deliveries cracks me up because they come off sounding pleasant yet the message is not so nice, like coming into the office on the weekends. That I can also relate at my job to which scares me. Stephen Root as Milton was even more hysterical. If anything should be learned from Milton is that be careful of who you push around because you never know what could happen. LOL! I love the pieces of flare that Jennifer Aniston has to wear at a TGI-like restaurant. I cracked up when her boss implied that good employees wears lots of pieces of flare (which are basically cheesy buttons). My most personal favorite moment in the film is the Michael Bolton character who immediately snaps at his cubical neighbor and refers to the pop singer of the same name as ""a no-talent @$$ clown"". I love ""Office Space"". Anyone who works for a corporation should really watch this movie. You will find this movie bearing a strong resemblence to your job.

Extras: 3 stars.Last week I was reminiscing with an engineer friend about seeing ""Office Space"" during its 1999 theatrical run.  He remembers me laughing constantly throughout the movie, and that flashback to a simpler time in my IT career caused me to finally get this DVD just so I could see it again and check out the extras.  Of course, ""Office Space"" is still awesome, but unfortunately the included ""flair"" is little more than the bare minimum.""Office Space"" centers on Peter Gibbons, a twenty-something programmer entombed at Initech working on the Y2K software update project (the only dated aspect of the film, but it could represent any office work scenario).  He's fed up with his mindless job, the lousy commute, uptight girlfriend Anne, and especially passive-aggressive boss Bill Lumbergh.  Cohorts in programming Michael and Samir have similar workplace issues, and all three commiserate while trapped in their cubes or over mid-morning coffee at T.G.I. Friday's clone Chotchkie's.One night, at the insistence of said girlfriend Peter sees a hypnotherapist to try and work through his malaise.  Things don't go quite as planned, and Peter emerges in a Zen-like state that enables him to step out and act without fear of failure, or really any fear at all.  Our hero quickly gets dumped by Anne, but winds up snagging a promotion and dating Joanna, the Chotchkie's waitress he had pined for from afar.  However, just as his Peter 2.0 life is going great he resolves to get back at Initech for its indignities, and that's when events begin to spin out of control.  To say much more would spoil the fun, but trust me when I apply the ""comedy classic"" label.All the actors from main roles to supporting players do a great job, and the jarring gangsta rap soundtrack fits like a pocket protector (after all, don't most of us want to bust out of our bland shells and live the glamorous thug life once in awhile?).  Case in point: Over time this flick spread through the corporate underbelly like a computer virus, and  it's hard to find any cubicle farm where the drones aren't tossing around lines such as: ""Yyyyeahhh...not a half-day...did you get that memo?...someone's got a case of the Mondays...I wouldn't say I've been MISSING work...""  ""Office Space"" captures the white-collar world in all its soul-crushing splendor, from incompetent management and inane company rules to office politics and oddball co-workers.  Indeed, we can count both ""The Office"" television series as its demented twin progeny.As for the extras?  Wwwweeellll, there aren't many buttons in this jar.  The ones included aren't bad, but I wanted more than a short retrospective hosted by creator/director Mike Judge, some deleted scenes, the theatrical trailer, and media for your PC.  Sorely missed are a commentary track by Mr. Judge and stars, along with, say, an extended cut and a longer documentary.

I had never heard of it before, but I decided to check it out. It's one of the funniest movies I've seen in a very long time.The opening seen is hilarious. Peter (played by Ron Livingston), who is stuck in a traffic jam finds himself making less forward progress than an old man with a walker. That's the kind of day Peter's day seems to begin every day with something going wrong.From there Peter goes to his job as a computer technological company where he always has issues with the boss and the damn copying machine which never seems to work.When Peter and his friends are frustrated and upset about work their boss says they must have ""a case of the Mondays."" Then they go to the shop next door and order coffee and ask the waitress (played by Diedrich Bader), what she would say if someone told you ""I think I have the case of the Mondays?"" The waitresses reply: HILARIOUS!!!Michael Bolton, a friend of Peter's, comes up with a ""genius"" plan to make them millionaires in a matter of a few years while screwing their company.Overall this is a great hilarious and humorous movie with great acting (especially Peter and Milton) that will make you laugh.I have seen this movie twice and I love it! This is a great movie rent and watch with your friends or at a party.

Using a number of relative unknowns he spends 2 hours skewering the people and situations all of us cubicle-dwellers hate at work.  While sometimes slightly uneven in composition, it remains a bravura comedy that'll keep you laughing through to the end.Peter Gibbons (Livingston) hates his job at Initech, so much so that each day there feels worse than the day before.  But when a botched-up hypnotism session leaves him unworried about his job and other cares Peter feels free to throw caution to the wind, deciding to stop coming in to work.  He's amazed to find that instead of getting fired he's getting promoted while his hard-working friends (Ajay Naidu &amp; David Herman, in the best buddy-buddy supporting actor performances of 1999) are getting downsized.  They together decide to rip off the company, and hilarity insues.  While the idea of playing into all of our hate of the foibles of the office workplace seems like a 1-note tune, Judge's writing and directing keeps a brisk pace and provides enough insight and analysis of why we despise these things and how they could be better that it never feels that way.Look for Stephen Root as Milton, by far the most hilarious character, stealing every scene he's in.  Close behind is Gary Cole as Bill Lumbergh, about the slimiest weasel of a boss I could have imagined.  Jennifer Aniston, while not bad, could have been replaced by virtually anyone else in the part who would have done as well with Judge's writing.The DVD &amp; Technical aspects:While the sound seems a little harsh and the color tones and cinematography may be a little inconsistent, these look like problems related to the movie's production, not the printing of the DVD itself.  Chalk it up to the fact that it's a low, low-budget comedy - if you've seen enough films you'll see this has slightly sub-par production values in general.  The menu is interestingly designed, the only real extra is the preview trailer.  The movie may be in Dolby 5.1, but it's a dialogue-based office comedy so as you imagine it doesn't use much of its capabilities to provide sense of place.",4,Comedy of surprising complexity - Film &amp; DVD review,979171200,"01 11, 2001",2001,2137,"['Film', 'Mike', 'Judge', 'genius', 'Using', 'number', 'relative', 'unknowns', '2', 'hours', 'skewering', 'people', 'situations', 'cubicle-dwellers', 'hate', 'work', 'sometimes', 'slightly', 'uneven', 'composition', 'bravura', 'comedy', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'laughing', 'end.Peter', 'Gibbons', 'Livingston', 'job', 'Initech', 'so', 'much', 'day', 'there', 'worse', 'day', 'when', 'botched-up', 'hypnotism', 'session', 'unworried', 'job', 'other', 'cares', 'Peter', 'feels', 'free', 'throw', 'caution', 'wind', 'deciding', 'stop', 'coming', 'work', 'amazed', 'find', 'instead', 'getting', 'fired', 'getting', 'promoted', 'hard-working', 'friends', 'Ajay', 'Naidu', 'amp', 'David', 'Herman', 'best', 'buddy-buddy', 'supporting', 'actor', 'performances', '1999', 'are', 'getting', 'downsized', 'together', 'decide', 'rip', 'off', 'company', 'hilarity', 'insues', 'idea', 'playing', 'hate', 'foibles', 'office', 'workplace', '1-note', 'tune', 'Judge', 'writing', 'directing', 'keeps', 'brisk', 'pace', 'enough', 'insight', 'analysis', 'why', 'despise', 'things', 'how', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'never', 'way.Look', 'Stephen', 'Root', 'Milton', 'far', 'most', 'hilarious', 'character', 'stealing', 'scene', 'Close', 'behind', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'Bill', 'Lumbergh', 'slimiest', 'weasel', 'boss', 'could', 'have', 'imagined', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'not', 'bad', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'replaced', 'virtually', 'anyone', 'else', 'part', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'as', 'well', 'Judge', 'writing.The', 'DVD', 'amp', 'Technical', 'aspects', 'sound', 'little', 'harsh', 'color', 'tones', 'cinematography', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'inconsistent', 'look', 'problems', 'related', 'movie', 'production', 'not', 'printing', 'DVD', 'Chalk', 'up', 'fact', 'low', 'low-budget', 'comedy', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'enough', 'films', ""'ll"", 'see', 'slightly', 'sub-par', 'production', 'values', 'general', 'menu', 'interestingly', 'designed', 'only', 'real', 'extra', 'preview', 'trailer', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'Dolby', '5.1', 'dialogue-based', 'office', 'comedy', 'so', 'imagine', ""n't"", 'use', 'much', 'capabilities', 'provide', 'sense', 'place']",Office Space VHS

The ""Out of the Office"" Office Space Retrospective with Writer/Director Mike Judge allows you to see the animation and voices in the cartoon where Milton and Lumbergh originated. It goes over the casting process of how they found each actor and how that actor interpreted their characters and motivations. There are also eight deleted scenes where Peter is being caught in a lie about his whereabouts, Happy hour at the restaurant where Peter talks about the hypothetical no job scenario, Peter goes off on Nina, Peter grandstanding about life and revelations which doesn't make a lot of sense at that moment in his new carefree zen state, etc. As with almost all deleted scenes, the movie is better without them.",5,"""Office Space"" is a necessary comedy in EVERY collection and is great on blu-ray!",1292025600,"12 11, 2010",2010,1720,"['1', 'Blu-ray', 'disc', 'released', 'February', '2009Some', 'comedy', 'classics', 'stay', 'fresh', 'forever', 'one', 'still', 'eleven', 'years', 'Office', 'Space', 'Mike', 'Judge', 'comedy', 'cubicle', 'life', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'memorable', 'characters', 'Lumbergh', 'played', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'who', 'out', 'sentences', 'Milton', 'played', 'Stephen', 'Root', 'who', 'squirrelly', 'guy', 'management', 'issues', 'red', 'Swingline', 'stapler.It', 'fantasy', 'what', 'many', 'office', 'workers', 'feel', 'life', 'what', 'would', 'love', 'do', 'working', 'up', 'beat', 'down', 'fax', 'machine.Bonus', 'Features', 'new', 'trivia', 'track', 'called', 'Post-It', 'Pandemonium', 'where', 'post-its', 'appear', 'screen', 'random', 'places', 'facts', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'ever', 'need', 'know', 'necessarily', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'cool', 'while', 'little', 'annoying', 'cover', 'up', 'other', 'stuff', 'screen.If', 'games', 'bunch', 'can', 'play', 'Grab', 'Stapler', 'Printer', 'Beat-Down', 'Whack-a-Drone', 'Jump', 'Conclusions', '2.0', 'Out', 'Office', 'Office', 'Space', 'Retrospective', 'Writer/Director', 'Mike', 'Judge', 'see', 'animation', 'voices', 'cartoon', 'where', 'Milton', 'Lumbergh', 'originated', 'casting', 'process', 'how', 'found', 'actor', 'how', 'actor', 'interpreted', 'characters', 'motivations', 'are', 'also', 'eight', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'where', 'Peter', 'being', 'caught', 'lie', 'whereabouts', 'Happy', 'hour', 'restaurant', 'where', 'Peter', 'hypothetical', 'job', 'scenario', 'Peter', 'off', 'Nina', 'Peter', 'grandstanding', 'life', 'revelations', ""n't"", 'make', 'lot', 'sense', 'moment', 'new', 'carefree', 'zen', 'state', 'etc', 'almost', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'movie', 'better']",Office Space VHS

467342,A1EBJ93E1T50RT,6305499365,Jason A. Miller,"[7, 9]","""Office Space"" isn't the funniest movie ever made, but it's certainly one of my favorites. Like zillions of other people, I was introduced to this movie while trapped in a miserable soul-sucking job in a dysfunctional office environment. The kind of job where I'd spend Sundays curled up on the couch in a fetal position dreading Monday ... the kind of job where I'd dread Friday nights because I knew they weren't going to last long.I wore out my VHS copy of this film years ago, so the DVD special edition got snapped up in a hurry. Some of the deleted scenes are hilarious, although the best new footage -- John C. McGinley's extended riffs on the wonder that is Michael Bolton -- is only to be found in the Mike Judge-hosted retrospective making-of feature.In your darkest moments, ""Office Space"" is that shining jewel that makes life bearable again. It is indeed chicken soup for the cubicled soul. It's all ""about"" the workplace in America in the 1990s -- the cubicle-bound middle-management culture is so brilliantly dissected. From the traffic jam in the opening scene to the soulless birthday party held for the ""division VP"" towards the end, to the blinding white rage of the gangsta rap soundtrack, it is so funny that you will hurt.The cast is outstanding, of course. It was shocking to find out that long-time ""Cheers"" barstool occupant Paul Willson was cast at the last minute; he's exactly the kind of actor you'd expect to find on the fringes of a movie like this one, so you wonder why it took so long to find him. Everyone has their personal favorites among the supporting players (McGinley & Willson, Ajay Naidu and Gary Cole all rob blind every scene they're in) but David Herman, playing ""Michael Bolton"", is my personal favorite. Maybe it's the short-sleeve-shirt with tie ensemble, or the printer scene, or, at long last, ""Call me Mike"", but there are times when I've watched ""Office Space"" just to identify with him and his plight.In the end, ""Office Space"" went from just funny to truly life-changing the moment Peter Gibbsons said that he dreamed of doing ""nothing"". That's it! That's the moment! That's what we all really want, deep down, after years of crushing middle-management rules, memos, and coffee cups held chest-high. Yeah. Great.

467344,ABDHAYPNM28US,6305499365,Jason,"[63, 66]","I first watched ""Office Space"" on a laptop in a Tuscaloosa hotel with my future wife. We were on our way to a conference, and she suggested that we watch this movie. It wasn't too late in the evening, and the running time seemed reasonably short at approximately 90 minutes. I also figured that it would be pretty good, especially with Mike Judge as the writer and director. After having watched it several times since then, I am convinced that ""Office Space"" is one of the very best cinematic comedies made in recent years.Watching ""Office Space"" seems especially therapeutic after dealing with craziness at work. This probably explains the film's broad appeal; it resonates with people who have needed to suffer bureaucratic B.S., the latest manifestations of ""office speak,"" and arbitrary rules at some point in their working lives. Of course, Judge himself drew upon his own memories of work in an office, which he finally escaped after hitting upon the idea for ""Beavis and B*tt-head."" Although some people have criticized ""Office Space"" for not having enough ""funny stuff,"" they don't seem to understand the subtlety of Judge's humor, which leans towards the dry and sardonic. One could almost imagine Billy Wilder feeling at home with the plot, though he might have needed a little extra nudging to include the gangsta rap songs.With a cast that includes no ""big-name stars"" (except Jennifer Aniston), no central performer clamors for attention with cloying ""hilarity."" In fact, the quotidian nature of the characters actually enhances the humor. The characters in subordinate positions try to deal with inanities at work by stewing, fretting, and venting in private. Meanwhile, those with more power are content to reinforce the craziness because it guarantees their power, or because they are so entrenched in their positions that they don't recognize the arbitrary nature of the rules they enforce.The characters are also funny because they remind me of people I have encountered throughout my life. Granted, they come across as caricatures to a degree, but the characters still seem more real than those conjured up for overly facile yuck-fests. In our own lives, many of us probably think that we are ""normal,"" like the main character Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) or his girlfriend Joanna (Aniston). However, not everyone can be like Peter or Joanna... or at least our perceptions of them as ""normal."" Peter's sudden ""transformation"" into a quasi-Zen warrior, as well as Joanna's semi-stoner attitude, might just put them way outside the mainstream. In any case, I've seen enough people who share similarities with one, or even several, of these characters:- Bill Lumbergh (Gary Cole), Peter's passive-aggressive, narcissistic, and clueless Yuppie boss (complete with aviator glasses, power tie, and coffee mug) at Initech- Michael Bolton (David Herman), Peter's nerdy coworker who just itches to unleash his internal Navy SEAL and gangsta- Samir Nagheenanajar (Ajay Naidu), Peter's resourceful coworker who wants to ""make it"" in America- Lawrence (Diedrich Bader), Peter's no-nonsense, no-collar neighbor and de facto confidant at the thin-walled Morningwood Apartments- ""The Bobs"" (John C. McGinley and Paul Willson), coldly congenial external consultants hired by Initech to figure out how the company can ""cut costs""- Tom Smykowski (Richard Riehle), the older Initech employee whose forced joviality barely disguises his anxiety about falling victim to The Bobs- Stan (a well-disguised cameo by Judge himself), Joanna's flair-obsessed boss at the T.G.I. Friday's-like restaurant Chotchkies, which provides a non-office doppelg&auml;nger for Peter's work environmentAnd yes, I've seen a few people who remind me of Milton Waddams (Stephen Root), the put-upon office gnome with his barely audible stream-of-consciousness mumbling, coke-bottle glasses, outdated sense of non-fashion, and a passive-aggressive attitude matching that of Lumbergh (and that Lumbergh ultimately underestimates). Peter may be the story's main protagonist, but one could see Milton as an odd sort of antihero as well. His almost incoherent mumbling, mainly consisting of requests to clarify matters regarding his salary, his desk, and his red Swingline stapler, acts as a more personalized counterpoint to the double-talk and nonsensical policies that drive Initech. Albeit in extreme fashion, Milton also demonstrates that greed can only propel a business so far, and that an ultimate moral obligation to one's shareholders doesn't always pay off.For ""Office Space"" aficianados, the ""Special Edition with Flair"" includes a 30 minute documentary that provides some insights into the making of the movie. Some of it might not seem like news to hardcore fans, but I learned a few new things: how Gary Cole came up with Lumbergh's voice; the ""bons mots"" Diedrich Bader improvised as Lawrence; how Stephen Root got around in thick glasses; where Ajay Naidu learned his dance moves; and the origin of the word a**clown. It also includes eight deleted scenes (some of which you might miss if you blink) and computer downloads. Alas, it does not include the animated ""Milton"" shorts created by Mike Judge in 1991, which provided the original inspiration for ""Office Space."" That's about as disappointing as excluding ""Hearts of Darkness"" from the ""Apocalypse Now Redux.""Whether one gets ""Office Space"" with or without flair, I can guarantee a good laugh to anyone who has had to deal with any kind of work-related nonsense at some point in their lives. It might not change the world, but ""Office Space"" will probably remain an effective purgative for anyone who has encountered such situations. If nothing else, one can at least hope that the insights of ""Office Space"" will inform the ethics of up-and-coming managers, and make them prioritize the things that really should matter at work.",5,Decline and Fall of the Cubicle,1131840000,"11 13, 2005",2005,5875,"['first', 'watched', 'Office', 'Space', 'laptop', 'Tuscaloosa', 'hotel', 'future', 'wife', 'were', 'way', 'conference',

His portrayal of Bill Lundberg (SP?) is so dead-on it is just hilarious to watch. Ron Livingston plays Peter Gibbons, an everyday 9 to 5 computer programmer for Initech. He hates his job and the whole rat race that surrounds it. In fact, all he really wants to do is watch Kung Fu with his super hot girlfriend played by Jennifer Aniston. So after being somewhat hypnotized during a therapy session, Peter decides to just stop going to work or going on his own terms which leads to hilarious results. Peter's cadre of co-workers include his underappreciated buddies Samir and Michael Bolton. When Peter learns that Initech plans to fire Samir and Michael, they hatch a scheme to rip off the company. If you've ever hated your job or felt trapped in a terrible company then you will definitely relate to Office Space. You may also recognize Milton (the office psycho) as the nerdy fat guy from dodgeball. Milton loves his red swingline stapler and playing his music at a reasonable volume. Diedrich Bader is also hilarious as Peter's neighbor Lawrence. Anyway, this movie is laugh out loud funny and a great addition to any DVD collection.

Dietrich Bader (hilariously disguised in a mullet wig and biker mustache) provides a great white trash accent as Peter's goofy neighbor.  Our hero Peter is played by Ron Livingston.  Peter turns into an unlikely hero, doing what all of us wish we had the guts to do in our sterile office environments.

467352,AZ1UFPNARPZD2,6305499365,"Jeffrey Ellis ""bored recluse""","[15, 16]","After a breif run at the theaters, Office Space has found a renewed and vibrant life on video tape.  It seems that everyone I talk to -- no matter what their age, background, or current job -- considers this film to be a personal favorite, a film that they can especially relate to.  The reasons are pretty obvious.  Everyone hates their job.  Everyone feels that they're working for idiots who fail to understand just how special and unique their neglected employees truly are.  This is something that we all have in common, whether we work for a retail chain or a fortune 500 company.  This is also a feeling that Office Space manages to perfectly capture.Taking place in Houston in waning days of the 20th Century, Office Space stars Ron Livingston as an affable computer programmer who has found himself stuck in a dead end job that requires him to spend countless hours looking over a code to make sure that various computers are Y2K compliant.  Its a job that makes little sense to him but one that he's expected to devote his life to.  His coworkers are all incredibly (and realistically) annoying.  Who hasn't had to deal with someone like the ""Look's Like Somebody's Got a Case of the Mondays!"" woman?  His boss's (a hilarious Gary Cole) blandly friendly manner brings new meaning to the term ""corporate evil,"" while over in the next cubicle, pasty-faced Milton (Stephen Root, also hilarious) mutters about burning down the building.  Finally fed up, Livington first seeks help from a hypnotherapist, pursues a relationship with a waitress (Jennifer Anniston who is sweetly likeable here but doesn't have much to do) at a generic Chili's-like establishment, and finally engages in a plan to embezzle money from the company.Obviously, the plot is a little bit ragged and at times, it seems as if director Mike Judge and his actors made up the plot as they went along.  But no matter, the film's quality is not to be found in the plot as much as in how it captures the small, realistic details that makes everyone hate their job.  From the pointless memos to the corporate stooges, Office Space captures them all and sends them up in such a savagely hilarious way that the film serves as a wonderful catharsis for anyone whose just finished a hard day at work.  Office workers will especially appreciate the scene in which Livingston and two recently laid off co-workers take revenge on an irksome xerox machine.  (If not for the fact that children might be reading this review, I'd quote the rap song that plays over this scene but let's just say that its impossible not to cheer as our workers get their revenge.)Judge, best known as the creator of Beavis and Butthead, directs in an offhand, almost casual manner.  There's a relaxed air about the whole affair and you get the feeling that everyone involved in the film was having a good time.  Luckily, the feeling is infectous.  The film is also well-acted by everyone involved.  Along with Cole, Aniston, and Root, good supporting work is given by Deidrich Bader who plays Livingston's redneck neighbor.  Ron Livingston is the perfect everyman lead for this film and gives a totally winning and likeable performance.With its portrait of mindless office jobs, Ikea-furnished apartments, and overly intelligent people struggling to find some way to establish some sort of individual identity in a corporate culture, Office Space at times plays like the gentler, slightly more juvenile cousin of Fight Club.  Whereas Fight Club battled modern culture through violence, Office Space battles modern culture through practical jokes and whoppee cushions.  Both films are must sees for anyone who has ever hated having to make a living.",4,For anyone who has ever hated their job...,1015891200,"03 12, 2002",2002,3690,"['breif', 'run', 'theaters', 'Office', 'Space', 'found', 'renewed', 'vibrant', 'life', 'video', 'tape', 'everyone', 'talk', 'matter', 'what', 'age', 'background', 'current', 'job', 'considers', 'film', 'be', 'personal', 'favorite', 'film', 'can', 'especially', 'relate', 'reasons', 'are', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'Everyone', 'job', 'Everyone', 'feels', ""'re"", 'working', 'idiots', 'who', 'fail', 'understand', 'just', 'how', 'special', 'unique', 'neglected', 'employees', 'truly', 'are', 'something', 'have', 'common', 'work', 'retail', 'chain', 'fortune', '500', 'company', 'also', 'feeling', 'Office', 'Space', 'perfectly', 'capture.Taking', 'place', 'Houston', 'waning', 'days', '20th', 'Century', 'Office', 'Space', 'Ron', 'Livingston', 'affable', 'computer', 'programmer', 'who', 'found', 'stuck', 'dead', 'end', 'job', 'spend', 'countless', 'hours', 'looking', 'code', 'make', 'sure', 'various', 'computers', 'are', 'Y2K', 'compliant', 'job', 'little', 'sense', 'one', 'expected', 'devote', 'life', 'coworkers', 'are', 'incredibly', 'realistically', 'annoying', 'Who', ""n't"", 'had', 'deal', 'someone', 'Look', 'Somebody', 'Got', 'Case', 'Mondays', 'woman', 'boss', 'hilarious', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'blandly', 'friendly', 'manner', 'new', 'meaning', 'term', 'corporate', 'evil', 'next', 'cubicle', 'pasty-faced', 'Milton', 'Stephen', 'Root', 'also', 'hilarious', 'mutters', 'burning', 'down', 'building', 'Finally', 'fed', 'up', 'Livington', 'first', 'help', 'hypnotherapist', 'relationship', 'waitress', 'Jennifer', 'Anniston', 'who', 'sweetly', 'likeable', 'here', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'do', 'generic', ""Chili's-like"", 'establishment', 'finally', 'plan', 'embezzle', 'money', 'company.Obviously', 'plot', 'little', 'bit', 'ragged', 'times', 'director', 'Mike', 'Judge', 'actors', 'made', 'up', 'plot', 'went', 'along', 'matter', 'film', 'quality', 'not', 'be', 'found', 'plot', 'as', 'much', 'how', 'small', 'realistic', 'details', 'everyone', 'hate', 'job', 'pointless', 'memos', 'corporate', 'stooges', 'Office', 'Space', 'up', 'such', 'savagely', 'hilarious', 'way', 'film', 'wonderful', 'catharsis', 'anyone', 'just', 'finished', 'hard', 'day', 'work', 'Office', 'workers', 'will', 'especially', 'appreciate', 'scene', 'Livingston', 'two', 'recently', 'laid', 'off', 'co-workers', 'take', 'revenge', 'irksome', 'xerox', 'machine', 'not', 'fact', 'children', 'might', 'be', 'reading', 'review', ""'d"", 'quote', 'rap', 'song', 'scene', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'impossible', 'not', 'cheer', 'workers', 'get', 'revenge', 'Judge', 'best', 'known', 'creator', 'Beavis', 'Butthead', 'offhand', 'almost', 'casual', 'manner', 'relaxed', 'air', 'whole', 'affair', 'get', 'feeling', 'everyone', 'involved', 'film', 'was', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'Luckily', 'feeling', 'infectous', 'film', 'also', 'well-acted', 'everyone', 'involved', 'Cole', 'Aniston', 'Root', 'good', 'supporting', 'work', 'given', 'Deidrich', 'Bader', 'who', 'Livingston', 'redneck', 'neighbor', 'Ron', 'Livingston', 'perfect', 'everyman', 'lead', 'film', 'totally', 'winning', 'likeable', 'performance.With', 'portrait', 'mindless', 'office', 'jobs', 'Ikea-furnished', 'apartments', 'overly', 'intelligent', 'people', 'struggling', 'find', 'way', 'establish', 'sort', 'individual', 'identity', 'corporate', 'culture', 'Office', 'Space', 'times', 'plays', 'gentler', 'slightly', 'more', 'juvenile', 'cousin', 'Fight', 'Club', 'Whereas', 'Fight', 'Club', 'battled', 'modern', 'culture', 'violence', 'Office', 'Space', 'modern', 'culture', 'practical', 'jokes', 'whoppee', 'cushions', 'films', 'are', 'must', 'sees', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'hated', 'having', 'make', 'living']",Office Space VHS

If you have ever worked in a cubicle, this movie will strike a chord within you.  Whether you are seeing the consultants, or efficiency experts, interview people before the lay-off; listening to the sing-song voice of the customer service representative, or watching the employees get mad at the fax machine; this will all seem eerily familiar.Quite a few of the scenes nod to other movies of popular culture, as well as sate our thirst for revenge against work.  This mixture makes from some memorable images.  The camera work used as the conspirators initiate their plan or ""celebrate"" their lay-off is hilarious.My problem with the film is that it feels great as a series of short films, but as a whole movie, it doesn't hold up as well.  Although Mike Judge (who wrote, directed, and acted here) forecasts what would happen in the end, it still feels like ""deus ex machina.""

467359,APRU373UYVK2Y,6305499365,J. N. Mohlman,"[1, 1]","""Office Space"" does for the movies what ""Dilbert"" did for the comic pages.  By taking the insanity of office life to it's logical, but absurd, conclusion ""Office Space"" has created an instant classic for those of us subjected to the ""attack of the MBA's"" on a daily basis.  At its core the movie asks the question we have all asked, ""how much attention is anyone really paying to me?""  As the hero repeatedly does and says what we would all like to, he comes to be perceived as a ""straight shooter"" with ""management potential"".  Likewise, his co-workers represent the gamut of corporate personalities: the inane VP who spews corporate jargon to hide his gross ignorance, the weird guy who seems to operate outside any corporate hierarchy, the useless consultants, the idiotic support staff, they're all there.The plot of the movie revolves around an attempt exact revenge on this corporation by ripping it off.  But you can take it or leave it, I would have been content just to watch the actors bash corporate sacred cows for two hours.  It's actually almost uplifting because it reassures the viewer that they are not alone in confronting stupidity on the job.In the end, this is a shallow movie, and the DVD has no interesting extra features.  That doesn't matter though, because it is also a hysterically funny, dead on satire of office life.

That's what makes the movie so delightfully funny: seeing characters on screen act out (without much exaggeration) the trials and tribulations of today's desk-bound workforce.The plot of the movie itself is somewhat secondary to its entertainment value.  Basically, the main character (Ron Livingston) isn't happy with his job; having been asked once by his high school guidance counselor to picture what he'd do without being paid and consider that his ideal job, he responded that he's like to sit around and do nothing.  The rest of the main plot centers on his attempt to get his life back on track, from discovering a love interest in a local waitress (Jennifer Anniston) also unhappy with her job to plotting revenge on his company for firing his friends.Quickly one sees exactly why the characters are so unhappy with their jobs: a clueless, paper-shuffling boss who speaks in total monotone; inane office regulations requiring more time spent on reports than on real work; faulty office equipment; and so on.  Carefully crafted to represent archetypes we all know from our own office experiences, the characters and their attempts to break free of the 9-to-5 drudgery are absolutely hilarious.You don't have to be a computer programmer or engineer to enjoy this film--all you need is to have worked somewhere once in your life that was far from the ideal environment.

But I've heard many good things about Office Space and I see why. This was a terrific, funny, and entertaining movie. The film is very funny (a lot of it is subtle humor and it's charming). Ron Livingston plays Peter, a typical working man who works at Initech but hates his job which he views as merely sitting in a cubicle. He works along with two very funny co-workers;Michael Bolton (David Herman), no relation to the pop star and Samir (Ajay Naidu). After a strange experience with a hypnotist Peter decides he's just not going to go to work and stay at home. Then he gets a sexy girlfriend Joanna (Jennifer Aniston) and gets promoted. The film also includes the character that inspired the movie Milton (Stephen Root, Dodgeball) who is a mumbling idiot who was laid off from Initech months ago but continues to recieve a paycheck due to a glitch in the system...As I said it's subtle humor. One part that I found hilarious was when Michael is sitting in his car rapping along to this hardcore gangster rap, really getting into it and when a black man walks past his car he locks the door.

I think this touches a nerve in the heart of everyone who watches it knowing that their life does, or someday will, revolve around a clock, a computer and socializing with a group of people you would otherwise avoid like the plague...Mike Judge creates a fantastic bunch of characters, largely unsympathetic and weaves a plot around them that, while reminiscent of Superman 3, ends up playing second fiddle to the sharp dialogue, the set-piece sketches and the ironic, but perfectly captured interpersonal relationships that will resonate so intensely with the right viewer.The only people I've ever heard of who didn't like this film were a bunch of management consultants from London who didn't find it at all funny...

Gelwasser,"[10, 11]","Mike Judge's &quot;Office Space&quot; is a sharp, satirical film comedy, which takes dead aim at white collar, corporate life and hits the bull's eye.The film is about a young guy named Peter (Ron Livingston), who works in a soulless, high-tech, corporation. He hates everything about his pencil pushing, paper shuffling, numbers crunching job and feels trapped. He hates it so much, that he goes to a 'Occupational Hypnotist' for therapy. But through a tragically, bizarre (and darkly funny) accident he gets a hypnotic suggestion in his brain to no longer give a dam about his job or financial security.With his new found attitude, he basically turns his office upside down.(I love the scene where he guts a fish on his desk!) Along the way, Peter and a pair of frustrated downsized, software engineers (David Herman &amp; Ajay Naidu), conspire to release a computer virus, that will slowly defraud the company of huge sums of money.Unfortunately something goes horribly wrong with the program and the guys must figure out a way to keep the corporate bosses from discovering their crime.When this movie was originally released in 1999 it bombed and quickly left the theatres. But through DVD/video sales &amp; rentals, constant airings on cable television and good 'word of mouth', it became a cult film with a following. I think the reason this comedy resonates within people is because it gets all the details of corporate life... so right. Director-Writer, Mike Judge (Creator of both &quot;Beavis &amp; Butthead&quot; and &quot;King of the Hill&quot;) includes everything from the well manicured but dull corporate parks to the mind numbing fluorescent lighting and the earth toned, cage-like cubicals, that you would love to bang your head against.Judge gives us all the characters you almost always find in the corporate hierarchy including the inhuman boss, the evil consultants,the penny-pinching bean counters, the gossips, the worriers, even the engineers, who think they know everything. This movie totally gets it's topic of 'office hell' and just runs with it! The cast is great all around. Standouts include Gary Cole as Lumbergh,the passive-aggresive, boss you'd love to kill and Stephen Root as Milton, a mumbling, put upon employee with a stapler obsession. Even Jennifer Aniston gives a good performance as a flair-impaired, waitress, who hates her job in a 'Fridays' style restaurant.If you work in an office, you will either laugh or cringe... or do both, while you watch this gut-busting, hilarious movie.

It is (simplistically) the story of three guys stuck in 'cubicle' jobs and the lengths they will go to get out of them. Peter, Zamir, and Michael (Bolton!) are stuck at Initech, until a hypnosis gone awry makes Peter, basically, do nothing. When the company bring in efficiency experts, he starts telling the truth about his deadend job (and TPS reports) and actually gets promoted, while his friends, who are busting their humps, get laid off. Good eventually triumphs over evil and it's all good.The movie is full of great characters, from the mumbling Milton (the movie is based this character, created by the same guy who made Beavis and Butthead); to the annoying boss, Lumberg; the sweet girlfriend (played by Jennifer Aniston); and, of course, the hero, Peter Gibbons (played by Ron Livingston).This movie is kind of an extreme version of the comic strip Dilbert, like what he would do if he actually listened to Dogbert.

Obviously I don't mean most of us are embezzling, but the set-up and the fantasy are realistic.  It's funny and close to a lot of people's lives, and it's kind of nice to see normalish lives in a movie.  Jennifer Aniston is good, as she generally is, but underused.

That happens.Anyhoo, anyone who sees this comedy will be able to relate, ESPECIALLY if they have ever worked in a dead-end office job...sure, some of it goes over the top, but it's done in such an original and witty way, that it only adds to it's hilariousness, with memorable characters like poor Milton, LOL!!!  None of this ever gets old, and the movie has an overabundance of quotable lines...the essential ingredients of a cult classic, just as I like it.  The US version of the show ""The Office"" WISHES it could be as grand as ""Office Space""...Now, this reissue (""with flair"") is perfectly timed, with a wealth of even more good stuff, hilarious packaging, the works....now, if you go to BestBuy and get their exclusive special edition...this is really cool...it comes in a funny mini cardboard file cabinet (you have to see it to believe it), filled with useful and meaningful stuff...besides the nicely packaged DVD (in the file cabinet slipcase), you get a magnet photoholder, red pen + pencil set (with the movie logo on both), a mousepad designed like the uniforms at ""Chotchkies"" (overload of pins aka ""flair""), a notepad with the ""Initech"" logo as a header, a coffee mug (with the boss and fave quote on it), and and AND?????  Your very own RED STAPLER (with ""Office Space"" printed on top), woohoo!!!!  Milton'd be jealous...and you don't have to annoy him or go down to his desert island to get one, YES!!!All in all, just getting this DVD itself is just a must-buy, with all the extras and classic movie (people will be quoting this and watching it regularly in 20 years, guaranteed), but getting this file cabinet is too good for words...meaningful to the movie AND useful (unlike the useless ""Deluxe Edition"" of ""The Big Lebowski"", which you're better off with just the reissued DVD itself...save the cash)!!!!",5,PERFECT TIMING (the movie and this special version)...,1130889600,"11 2, 2005",2005,2069,"['have', 'tell', 'Office', 'Space', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'THE', 'greatest', 'comedies', 'time', 'movie', 'relevant', 'day', 'age', 'maybe', 'even', 'moreso', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', '1999', 'perhaps', 'was', 'ahead-of-it', 'time', 'happens.Anyhoo', 'anyone', 'who', 'comedy', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'relate', 'ESPECIALLY', 'have', 'ever', 'worked', 'dead-end', 'office', 'job', 'sure', 'top', 'done', 'such', 'original', 'witty', 'way', 'only', 'hilariousness', 'memorable', 'characters', 'poor', 'Milton', 'LOL', 'None', 'ever', 'old', 'movie', 'overabundance', 'quotable', 'lines', 'essential', 'ingredients', 'cult', 'classic', 'just', 'US', 'version', 'show', 'Office', 'could', 'be', 'as', 'grand', 'Office', 'Space', 'Now', 'reissue', 'flair', 'perfectly', 'timed', 'wealth', 'even', 'more', 'good', 'stuff', 'hilarious', 'packaging', 'works', '.now', 'go', 'BestBuy', 'get', 'exclusive', 'special', 'edition', 'really', 'cool', 'funny', 'mini', 'cardboard', 'file', 'cabinet', 'have', 'see', 'believe', 'filled', 'useful', 'meaningful', 'stuff', 'nicely', 'packaged', 'DVD', 'file', 'cabinet', 'slipcase', 'get', 'magnet', 'photoholder', 'red', 'pen', '+', 'pencil', 'set', 'movie', 'logo', 'mousepad', 'designed', 'uniforms', 'Chotchkies', 'overload', 'pins', 'aka', 'flair', 'notepad', 'Initech', 'logo', 'header', 'coffee', 'mug', 'boss', 'fave', 'quote', 'AND', 'very', 'own', 'RED', 'STAPLER', 'Office', 'Space', 'printed', 'top', 'woohoo', 'Milton', ""'d"", 'be', 'jealous', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'annoy', 'go', 'down', 'desert', 'island', 'get', 'one', 'YES', 'just', 'getting', 'DVD', 'just', 'must-buy', 'extras', 'classic', 'movie', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'quoting', 'watching', 'regularly', '20', 'years', 'guaranteed', 'getting', 'file', 'cabinet', 'too', 'good', 'words', 'meaningful', 'movie', 'useful', 'useless', 'Deluxe', 'Edition', 'Big', 'Lebowski', ""'re"", 'better', 'off', 'just', 'reissued', 'DVD', 'save', 'cash']",Office Space VHS

One of my coworkers lent me this movie, promising me that I'd like it - he was right. It is both funny and tragic, though a bit exaggerated (but it's a MOVIE, where life circumstances do not have to be totally realistic).Most people can relate to Office Space, even if they don't have a cubicle-based job. I happen to have a cubicle-based job, though I recently moved from a rather large cubicle to an office, which I share with another coworker (there is a gray cubicle wall dividing it). It's not so bad though.  Anyway, the main character, Peter Gibbons, lacks motivation in his career and is fed up with a number of business practices. But he doesn't quit his job - he just stops working.  Doing nothing is his ideal life.The rap music is a nice touch.Now back to my favorite character, Milton, who repeatedly says that he ""could set the building on fire"" whenever things get too rough.  He is pathetic yet likeable, and I felt sorry for him when he didn't get any cake at the party. Everyone keeps passing it around, and he watches the cake get smaller and smaller until it is completely gone. And his desk is moved numerous times, which really irritates him. Eventually, he moves down to the basement, where it is dark and lonely.  His boss comes down to ask him to kill the cockroaches (""That would be terrific""), even though it's not Milton's job.  His distinctive ""Excuse me..."" protests are rarely heard. He is being used by the company, no one respects him, no one listens to him.

He has two geeky friends that hope to raise in ranks at Initech, the company they all work for.  Initech wants to downsize and increase profits by sending some jobs overseas, and eliminate others.Peter has a girlfriend that insists he go to therapy before they marry.  He agrees and is hypnotized at a group therapy session.  The overweight therapist that hypnotized Peter collapses and dies before he can take Peter out of the relaxing trance that makes him worry free.  He is now open to do what he wants, not what he feels he has to do to fit in his bland reality.  He was supposed to work overtime Saturday and Sunday, but sleeps through 17 messages from his boss and girlfriend.Peter goes back to work on Monday, not caring if he has a job or not.  He decides to just leave, and no longer have to deal with his boss, (Gary Cole).  However, Peter is reminded that his appointment with efficiency experts is now and he should go.  Because he could care less if he has his job; his leisurely new attitude and total honesty about his work habits, the efficiency experts are impressed.  Gibbons laughs that there is nothing to motivate him.  The efficiency experts are impressed and ecstatic that they found a ""button"" to motivate a talented employee.  He is promoted to supervise four people.  On leaving, Peter sees that the efficiency experts plan to lay off his two close friends.  The friends, along with Peter,  hatch a crazy plot to get back at the company.The movie also follows the pathetic life of the office worker ""Milton"" and his red ""Streamline"" stapler.  Milton moves from space to lower class space until his office is in the basement storeroom.  Milton is key to the ending, as well as many laughs.The plot continues to develop, including Gibbons  interest in a waitress (Jennifer Anniston) at the restaurant he takes coffee breaks at.  There is also a scheme between Gibbons and his two friends on how to make money without working.

Hines,"[24, 26]","If you have ever worked in a cubicle farm for a technology company, or ROFL after reading Dilbert cartoons, and know what ROFL means, you will love this movie.  Mike Judge (creator of Beavis and Butthead) digs into and makes fun of the things that people hate most about their jobs, with such accuracy that he must have consulted Scott Adams himself while developing the screenplay.With company names like &quot;Penetrode&quot;, this movie takes numerous humorous stabs at the idiocy foisted upon the modern working class by the &quot;management class&quot;, those highly-compensated stuffed-shirts with no more qualifications than an MBA hanging on their wall.  These are the people who abuse you every time you make a mistake, and try to convince you that they are really your buddy in a thinly veiled attempt to keep you submissive and cooperative.  Office Space tears into the very heart of the manipulative phony friendship ploy that so many managers think of as their &quot;brilliant&quot; management technique.So if you're tired of being shocked every time you touch a door knob, and sick of having half a dozen different &quot;bosses&quot; giving you conflicting work assignments, then I highly recommend that you buy this movie and blow off some steam, before it's too late!This film is a lot of fun to watch, but if you're looking for an intellectually challenging work of art, this is not the film for you.  The story is quite simple; it is a single-layer story that conveys the same information on subsequent viewing as it conveyed during the first viewing.  The visual and audio elements are interesting and entertaining, but not artistic.  This is a fun comedy that a lot of people can identify with, not deep social commentary.  However, the social commentary that IS in the film couldn't be more timely.The DVD itself is mediocre.  No extras to speak of, other than cast bios and one trailer.  Transitions from one menu to another are slightly animated, and the way the DVD starts up is cute, but overall the power of the DVD medium is not utilized.Movie-------Originality: B+Creativity: B+Complexity/Depth: C+Relevance/Message: A+Artistic Merit: COverall Entertainment Value: ADVD------Transfer Quality: AExtras: C-Use of Medium: C+",4,"So realistic, it makes my eyeballs ache",981072000,"02 2, 2001",2001,2249,"['have', 'ever', 'worked', 'cubicle', 'farm', 'technology', 'company', 'ROFL', 'reading', 'Dilbert', 'cartoons', 'know', 'what', 'ROFL', 'will', 'love', 'movie', 'Mike', 'Judge', 'creator', 'Beavis', 'Butthead', 'fun', 'things', 'people', 'hate', 'most', 'jobs', 'such', 'accuracy', 'must', 'have', 'consulted', 'Scott', 'Adams', 'developing', 'screenplay.With', 'company', 'names', 'quot', 'Penetrode', 'quot', 'movie', 'numerous', 'humorous', 'stabs', 'idiocy', 'foisted', 'modern', 'working', 'class', 'quot', 'management', 'class', 'quot', 'highly-compensated', 'stuffed-shirts', 'more', 'qualifications', 'MBA', 'hanging', 'wall', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'abuse', 'time', 'make', 'mistake', 'try', 'convince', 'are', 'really', 'buddy', 'thinly', 'veiled', 'attempt', 'keep', 'submissive', 'cooperative', 'Office', 'Space', 'very', 'heart', 'manipulative', 'phony', 'friendship', 'ploy', 'so', 'many', 'managers', 'think', 'quot', 'brilliant', 'quot', 'management', 'technique.So', ""'re"", 'tired', 'being', 'shocked', 'time', 'touch', 'door', 'knob', 'sick', 'having', 'dozen', 'different', 'quot', 'quot', 'giving', 'conflicting', 'work', 'assignments', 'then', 'highly', 'recommend', 'buy', 'movie', 'blow', 'off', 'steam', 'too', 'late', 'film', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', ""'re"", 'looking', 'intellectually', 'challenging', 'work', 'art', 'not', 'film', 'story', 'quite', 'simple', 'single-layer', 'story', 'same', 'information', 'subsequent', 'viewing', 'conveyed', 'first', 'viewing', 'visual', 'audio', 'elements', 'are', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'not', 'artistic', 'fun', 'comedy', 'lot', 'people', 'can', 'identify', 'not', 'deep', 'social', 'commentary', 'However', 'social', 'commentary', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'timely.The', 'DVD', 'mediocre', 'No', 'extras', 'speak', 'other', 'cast', 'bios', 'one', 'trailer', 'Transitions', 'one', 'menu', 'are', 'slightly', 'animated', 'way', 'DVD', 'up', 'cute', 'power', 'DVD', 'medium', 'not', 'utilized.Movie', '-Originality', 'B+Creativity', 'B+Complexity/Depth', 'C+Relevance/Message', 'A+Artistic', 'Merit', 'COverall', 'Entertainment', 'Value', 'ADVD', 'Transfer', 'Quality', 'AExtras', 'C-Use', 'Medium', 'C+']",Office Space VHS

I won't give away anything that you can't read in the Amazon Editorial, but the characters are so `clinically clich&eacute;' in a hilarious way.  You will recognize a person from your office in every scene and if you aren't seething with hate, you'll definitely be laughing hysterically.  The guys who scheme the money laundering are truly clever and the boss is truly an inspired piece of irritating nonsense.  Only the girlfriend lacks any comedic fashion other than the workplace she inhabits - a `Chili's' style restaurant nightmarishly funny in itself.  There are some fairly clever sight gags throughout the movie that just keep your interest on a constant level.  I won't say it's a fantastic film, but I sure as heck wasn't bored and found a lot of true, funny events to ponder.

He has the most annoying boss anybody could ask for and he  drives Peter nuts. Peter can't stand his job and his goal is to do absolutely nothing. He wants to do nothing and so he goes to a hypnotherapist to tell him about his problem. After an accident during the session Peter quickly finds himself stuck in his new dream of euphoria.He likes a waitress a waitress named Joanna(Aniston) who works at the burger coffee join that him and his buddies go to. He gets her to come along in his quest of nothingness.Layoffs are happening at Peters place of employment Intec. He is expecting to finally get laid off, but ends up with a promotion while his two best friends at work are scheduled to get fired. The three refuse to take it and come up with a stratedy to get back at Intec. They come up with a computer program that steals the extra cents from checks when they round down on the numbers in writing them. It's similar to the plot of Superman III. The plan backfires in Peters face and he is also struggling with his relationship with Joanna. He now must fix everything or wind up in jail.The movie is great. A lot of people wont enjoy that much, but for those who work daily office jobs this is one of the greatest movies you'll ever see. We've all wanted to do what Peter does as work in which he just tells everybody how it feels.

The setting for Office Space is an Information Technology company that processes transactions for Credit Unions, with a collection of employees that are all either bored, angry, aloof, incompetent, anxious or suffer from one of a hundred other maladies or neurotic manifestations.  No doubt this sort of work environment will be familiar to most.It would be convenient to say that this is just another movie about how the corporate work environment drains us of our humanity, but Office Space offers us much more. The mindless bureaucracy, doing work solely to satisfy some inane process (PTS Reports), the sense of detachment from reality is eerily reminiscent of a Kafka novel.  Lundberg, the boss, who is completely unaware of what his employees do and how they feel, endlessly repeats his mantra of ok, ok , while his employees become more and more stressed and unfulfilled.Peter, the lead character, undergoes a profound Peter Pan like psychological transformation after which he is no longer motivated to do his job.  He comes and goes as he pleases and begins to openly express his true feelings about the job and the environment.  His new relaxed attitude impresses the clueless consultants, with their prepackaged prescription for transforming the organization (i.e. reducing headcount), who have been brought in to fine tune the organization.Naturally, no story of this genre would be complete without a love connection between the main character and yet another troubled, trapped soul.  Peter's love interest comes by way of a waitress at a nearby restaurant who fights conformity by wearing only the minimum pieces of flair on her uniform.  She endures the endless questioning from her manager about why she wears only the minimum pieces of flair, when she is so clearly and simply trying to preserve some part of her humanity.The dam of self-control that held the employees in check finally begins to crack when Peter and two of his co-workers hatch a plot of revenge against the company.  Of course their plot like everything else goes badly wrong, but in the end it seems that justice is served.You will laugh out loud, you may cry at times, but if this dark comedy does not send your mind and heart in search of your humanity, sadly you have missed the point.",5,"Kafka, Peter Pan and Flair Oh My!",1226880000,"11 17, 2008",2008,2471,"['Are', 'fed', 'up', 'mindless', 'bureaucracy', 'workplace', 'nauseated', 'importance', 'process', 'results', 'anxiety', 'ridden', 'job', 'then', 'Office', 'Space', 'movie', 'setting', 'Office', 'Space', 'Information', 'Technology', 'company', 'transactions', 'Credit', 'Unions', 'collection', 'employees', 'are', 'either', 'bored', 'angry', 'aloof', 'incompetent', 'anxious', 'suffer', 'one', 'hundred', 'other', 'maladies', 'neurotic', 'manifestations', 'doubt', 'sort', 'work', 'environment', 'will', 'be', 'familiar', 'most.It', 'would', 'be', 'convenient', 'say', 'just', 'movie', 'how', 'corporate', 'work', 'environment', 'humanity', 'Office', 'Space', 'much', 'more', 'mindless', 'bureaucracy', 'doing', 'work', 'solely', 'satisfy', 'inane', 'process', 'PTS', 'Reports', 'sense', 'detachment', 'reality', 'eerily', 'reminiscent', 'Kafka', 'novel', 'Lundberg', 'boss', 'who', 'completely', 'unaware', 'what', 'employees', 'do', 'how', 'feel', 'endlessly', 'mantra', 'ok', 'ok', 'employees', 'become', 'more', 'more', 'stressed', 'unfulfilled.Peter', 'lead', 'character', 'profound', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'psychological', 'transformation', 'no', 'longer', 'motivated', 'do', 'job', 'openly', 'express', 'true', 'feelings', 'job', 'environment', 'new', 'relaxed', 'attitude', 'clueless', 'consultants', 'prepackaged', 'prescription', 'transforming', 'organization', 'i.e', 'reducing', 'headcount', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'brought', 'fine', 'organization.Naturally', 'story', 'genre', 'would', 'be', 'complete', 'love', 'connection', 'main', 'character', 'yet', 'troubled', 'trapped', 'soul', 'Peter', 'love', 'interest', 'way', 'waitress', 'nearby', 'restaurant', 'who', 'conformity', 'wearing', 'only', 'minimum', 'pieces', 'flair', 'uniform', 'endless', 'questioning', 'manager', 'why', 'only', 'minimum', 'pieces', 'flair', 'when', 'so', 'clearly', 'simply', 'trying', 'preserve', 'part', 'humanity.The', 'dam', 'self-control', 'held', 'employees', 'check', 'finally', 'crack', 'when', 'Peter', 'two', 'co-workers', 'hatch', 'plot', 'revenge', 'company', 'course', 'plot', 'everything', 'else', 'badly', 'wrong', 'end', 'justice', 'served.You', 'will', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'may', 'cry', 'times', 'dark', 'comedy', 'not', 'send', 'mind', 'heart', 'search', 'humanity', 'sadly', 'have', 'missed', 'point']",Office Space VHS

G Watson ""Miles Watson""","[5, 5]","From the opening scene, when Peter Gibbons's (Ron Livingston)freeway-jammed car is outpaced by an old man on a walker, to the Monday-morning showdown between Man and Copier, you know this is gonna be a good movie, and it doesn't disappoint. Anyone who has ever sat in a flourescent-lit cubicle listening to easy-listening music for hours at a stretch, week after week, with nothing to look forward to but more of the same until retirment (assuming you don't get downsized first) can relate to ""Office Space"" -- a surprisingly good first effort from Mike Judge, the guy who produced the lowest of the lowbrow, Beavis & Butt-Head, and later the more subtle ""King of the Hill."" The performances are really good all around: Livingston is perfecto as office-shmoe Gibbons, a passive nice-guy programmer stuck in a boring, dead-end office job who has a revelation that sooner or later comes to everyone in a cube: we only have so much time on this earth, and we weren't meant to spend it this way. Shedding his passive ways, Gibbons rebels against evil boss Lumbergh (great performance by Gary Cole) and recruits two pals, the unfortunately named Michael Bolton (David Herman -- ""Why should I change my name, he's the one that sucks!"") and Samir, to help him loot his place of work of a few hundred grand in cash, and sets out to win the girl of his dreams (Jennifer Aniston). The soundtrack, mostly gangsta rap hits by the Geto Boys, is hilariously inappropriate for the setting -- but then again maybe not, since everyone that works at Initech is swallowing a lot of rage (there is a classic scene of skinny computer-nerd Bolton expertly rapping out the lyrics to ""The Diary"" by Scarface in his car). ""Office Space"" is a great commentary on the modern workplace, but it is also a (non-violent) revenge fantasy that will speak to anyone who has ever fantasized about smashing a copier with a baseball bat or telling the boss: ""It's not that I'm lazy, it's just that I don't care.""",4,Didn't  you get the memo?,1019606400,"04 24, 2002",2002,1975,"['opening', 'scene', 'when', 'Peter', 'Gibbons', 'Ron', 'Livingston', 'freeway-jammed', 'car', 'outpaced', 'old', 'man', 'walker', 'Monday-morning', 'showdown', 'Man', 'Copier', 'know', 'gon', 'na', 'be', 'good', 'movie', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'Anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'sat', 'flourescent-lit', 'cubicle', 'listening', 'easy-listening', 'music', 'hours', 'stretch', 'week', 'week', 'nothing', 'look', 'forward', 'more', 'same', 'retirment', 'assuming', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'downsized', 'first', 'can', 'relate', 'Office', 'Space', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'first', 'effort', 'Mike', 'Judge', 'guy', 'who', 'produced', 'lowest', 'lowbrow', 'Beavis', 'Butt-Head', 'later', 'more', 'subtle', 'King', 'Hill', 'performances', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'Livingston', 'perfecto', 'office-shmoe', 'Gibbons', 'passive', 'nice-guy', 'programmer', 'stuck', 'boring', 'dead-end', 'office', 'job', 'who', 'revelation', 'later', 'everyone', 'cube', 'only', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'earth', 'were', ""n't"", 'meant', 'spend', 'way', 'Shedding', 'passive', 'ways', 'Gibbons', 'rebels', 'evil', 'boss', 'Lumbergh', 'great', 'performance', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'two', 'pals', 'unfortunately', 'named', 'Michael', 'Bolton', 'David', 'Herman', 'Why', 'should', 'change', 'name', 'one', 'Samir', 'help', 'loot', 'place', 'work', 'few', 'hundred', 'grand', 'cash', 'out', 'win', 'girl', 'dreams', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'soundtrack', 'mostly', 'gangsta', 'rap', 'hits', 'Geto', 'Boys', 'hilariously', 'inappropriate', 'setting', 'then', 'again', 'maybe', 'not', 'everyone', 'Initech', 'swallowing', 'lot', 'rage', 'classic', 'scene', 'skinny', 'computer-nerd', 'Bolton', 'expertly', 'rapping', 'out', 'lyrics', 'Diary', 'Scarface', 'car', 'Office', 'Space', 'great', 'commentary', 'modern', 'workplace', 'also', 'non-violent', 'revenge', 'fantasy', 'will', 'speak', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'fantasized', 'smashing', 'copier', 'baseball', 'bat', 'telling', 'boss', 'not', ""'m"", 'lazy', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'care']",Office Space VHS

Because it's not one of those movies that only relies on tired and crude offensive sex jokes and gross out humor.  (And yes, those are fine as well.  You'll notice that I didn't really have a problem with ""Freddy got Fingered.""  It just gets overplayed too much.)  The movie is actually ingenious with a great story, plot, and a terrific cast of characters.Peter Gibbons is living through Hell twenty-four-seven.  He works for a corporation that has eight bosses barking orders at him everyday.  It seems like it just gets worse everyday.  Well, that all changes when his eyes are open and his mind is at ease.  He realizes that the answer to his solution is to not care anymore.  And that's exactly what he does.I loved everything about this movie.  All of the characters are unique in each way.  But I must say, Milton steals the show.  The mumbling man is played by the very hillarious Stephen Root.  He really is the show-stopper.  Keep a close eye on him.This movie is so realistic, it hurts.  Especially if you work at that kind of an environment.  Come on, how many times have you been stuck in traffic and it seems like everyone is moving except for the people in your lane?

It ranks right up with ""Ghostbusters"" and ""Back to the Future"", but is a completely different type of movie.It is frankly brilliant. It's humor lies in the satirical realism in its portrayal of white-collar borgeois ennui (I was dying to use those words). Peter Gibbons is you and I: a bored and frustrated cubical drone who is surrounded by the most insane yet realistic office envoronment ever shown on film. Every office has these workers in it:1. The annoying phone-answering voice person. (Mina in Corporate Accounts Payable)2. The total nerd who thinks he's a tough-guy. (Michael ""Mike"" Bolton, look at his gangsta rap and Navy Seals posters in his cube)3. The annoying younger guy who is a sexual harassment case waiting to happen. (Drew, the ""oh"" face guy)4. The annoying older person who is eternally convinced they're going to get laid off (Tom Smigmikowski, the ""Jump to Conclusions"" guy).5. The easily irritable engineer type guy who can't figure out the copier / fax machine (Samir Naninagaja)6. The disgustingly happy and content person. (The ""case of the Mondays"" mail lady)7. The snide, ""method management"" boss who speaks to everyone like they're in 5th grade. (Lumberg)and of course...8. The twitchy postal case (Milton)All of these characters are people we know in our everyday dealings at work. That, combined with the cubical-farm of an office building that is Initech (direct competitor with Penetrode and Initrode) make this film almost frightening. The office is laden with Swingline staplers, walls adorned with lame ""Employee of the Month"" plaques, and ceilings with motivating corporate slogans like ""Is this good for THE COMPANY???"" We have all worked here before!!The humor is subtle and not at all goofy or in-your-face. Some may not find it as funny (probably corporate stuffed shirts and managers like Bill Lumberg) as those type of films,  but this is an intellegent and hysterical comedy nonetheless. Ron Livingston is a great actor who is just now becoming recognized after his role on ""The Pracice"" and in HBO's ""Band of Brothers"". He plays another great roll in the direct to video ""Body Shots"".

467398,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,6305499365,Mike S.,"[0, 0]","I really think this movie will hold up in any era.  Really as long as corporations exist this movie will be hilarious.  To the extent there is a plot it almost takes a back seat to making fun of the corporate culture.  And lets be honest, for those of us who work in the corporate world some of the things they are making fun of (albeit in over the top ways in some instances) still very much exist.  It was made from an animated short by Mike Judge the creator of Bevis and Butthead and King of the Hill.The movie centers around three guys who have crappy jobs at a corporation called Initech.  Ron Livingston plays Peter, who is the lead character.  He becomes completely apathetic toward his job after a botched hypnotherapy session, and basically tries to get fired.  He ends up hatching a plan to rip the company off that goes haywire.  Like I said, that is almost ancillary to the real purpose of the movie, which is to poke fun at office life, and the various characters.The movie has a truly ensemble cast, which was made up of relative unknowns.  They made a pretty big casting coup in landing Jennifer Aniston when Friends was immensely popular.  She really did not dominate the movie though and really fit in well with the ensemble cast.  The two most memorable characters in my opinion were Milton, played by Stephen Root and Lumberg played by Gary Cole.  All the actors did a wonderful job however, even those with the smallest roles.  It really seemed like they were all having fun with it, which along with the well written script (which has tons of quotable lines) really make the movie.It is really a &#34;cult classic&#34; kind of movie.  The brand of humor is probably not for everyone, but it holds up as well or better as any of the more modern day comedies do.  I think anyone who likes any of Judge's other work will find this enjoyable.  There is a lot of swearing in the movie, and in that respect it earns its R rating, but it is really nothing more than you get in any R rated comedy.  As far as extras go on the DVD there is an approximately half hour retrospective that was made in 2005.  There are also about 10 min worth of deleted scenes and the trailer.

467399,A27PSZX2SE0B51,6305499365,Mike Stone,"[4, 4]","I have a theory about upward mobility as it exists in a corporate workplace (actually, I've been relaying this theory for so long that I no longer remember if it is my own, or if I've stolen it from someone smarter than I; If it's the latter, I apologize for my thievery).  If one is ambitious enough, and good enough at their job, they will get promoted.  If they are still ambitious, and good enough at this new job, they will get promoted again.  This process continues until said person reaches the limits of their abilities.  Then they are promoted one last time, into a job that they can't possibly handle.  This is where they stay for the rest of their working lives.  I've seen it happen time and time again at my place of work, and it's this kind of sophistic reasoning that gets spoofed so mercilessly -- and so perfectly -- in &quot;Office Space&quot;.Writer/Director Mike Judge has crafted a spot on depiction of office life in the latter part of the twentieth century.  Technology has advanced to such a degree that those who fail to understand it are either relegated to being its slaves (a running joke here has a nefarious fax machine tormenting two programmers) or promoted to management.  Those in the latter category, made obsolete by technological advancements and having no real duties themselves, are relegated to becoming bothersome micromanagers, in the hopes that their stock rises a quarter of a point.  Everyone is worried about job security, and rightly so, for the average worker is about as interchangeable as the coffee machine, and respected less.  And anyone with any semblance of a soul is constantly involved in bemoaning the wastefulness of their lives.Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingstone) is one such troubled soul.  He's involved in his company's Y2K readiness project (with the benefit of hindsight, the pointlessness of this task is made even more pointed).  But he despises his job.  Tormented by ennui but hampered by lethargy, he sees no way out.  A fateful visit to a career-counseling hypnotist frees him from his shackles, by allowing him to relax into his job.  His newfound candidness is, of course, rewarded with a promotion.  Livingstone imbues Peter with a bland everymaness that is at once appealing and relatable.  He is surrounded by a madcap menagerie of accurately depicted office drones.David Herman (as the unfortunately named Michael Bolton) and Ajay Naidu play Peter's clueless programmer buddies, rebellious enough to constantly plot against the company, but too scared to do anything about it.  The three of them share my favourite scene in the movie, when the aforementioned fax machine is smuggled out of the office, and beaten mercilessly with a baseball bat.  Judge handles the scene like a hit in a mob movie, or a drive-by shooting, adding aggressive hip-hop music to the soundtrack, to play up the ridiculousness of the situation.  The scene is played as horrific, but turns out truly hilarious.  Other office citizens include John C. McGinley and Paul Willson, who play gleefully insipid consultants, brought in to give the company an excuse to downsize, and Richard Riehle as a paranoid lifer, whose job may or may not be redundant.The biggest cheers in the cast go to Gary Cole and Stephen Root.  The former plays VP Bill Lumbergh.  He's every employee's worst nightmare: a lifeless, endlessly droning, boring, malicious, and unimaginative manager.  Brought to life through a costume that includes unfashionable glasses, shirts that match collar to cuffs, and an ever-present coffee mug, Lumbergh subtly terrorizes all who serve him with salutations that make him appear interested, but in fact amplifies the apathy he has for his employees.  Cole nails Lumbergh perfectly, allowing the man's slime to ooze from every pore.  Stephen Root, in the film's showiest role, plays Milton, a milquetoast, asocial, &quot;squirrelly looking guy&quot;.  Saddled with coke bottle thick glasses and an inflamed complexion, Milton is the ultimate social outcast.  Root gives Milton an under-his-breath lispy voice, easy to overlook.  So much so that his repeated threats to &quot;burn the building down&quot; if not granted any respect go unnoticed.  The passive aggressive cat and mouse game fought between Lumbergh and Milton over a stapler (!) provide for some of the film's best and most telling moments.Jennifer Aniston, who plays Livingstone's love interest, does fine work with an underwritten role.  She brings a kind of quirky restlessness to Joanna the waitress (tormented by a witless boss of her own, played by Mike Judge himself), although her desperation shines through as well (otherwise, why would she torture herself working at a classless establishment as &quot;Chotchkie's&quot;?).&quot;Office Space&quot; will touch a nerve with anyone whose ever worked in a large office.  In fact, if you've ever encountered schizophrenic traffic (the film's opening scene follows Peter on his morning commute; he's caught in a hilarious catch-22, as any lane he changes to slows to a stop, just as the lane he's just come from starts to move), been bothered by door-to-door magazine salesmen, gotten zinged by static electricity, or been maligned by any of a dozen other inconveniences of modern urban life, you'll find something here to relate to.  And, ultimately, laugh at.",5,Working for a living is hardly living at all,1000512000,"09 15, 2001",2001,5335,"['have', 'theory', 'upward', 'mobility', 'corporate', 'workplace', 'actually', ""'ve"",

However, the hypnotist suffers a heart attack and dies right before he can snap Peter out of the trance. Now Peter doesn't have a care in the world, and is determined to get fired from his boring cubicle existence at Initech Corporation. Armed with a leisurely new attitude, and a sexy new girlfriend (Jennifer Anniston), he goes out of his way to neglect his job. However, this is where the story gets interesting, because it quickly gets Peter promoted into upper management. His two friends Samir Nayeenanajar (Ajay Naidu) and Michael Bolton (David Herman) always play by the rules. Unfortunately, they are fired due to cutbacks. So to get even, Peter and his two friends devise a plan to rip off the company.This is one of the funniest movies that I have ever seen. Everyone can relate to the story, because at one time or another, you have hated your job and wanted to do something about it. The characters in this movie, actually get to live out that fantasy. The acting is great all around. Ron Livingston is hilarious as Peter. Everything he does to upset his bosses and neglect his job is outstanding. David Herman and Ajay Naidu are extremely good as well. However Gary Cole gives the film's best performance as Bill Lumberg. ""Uh Yeahh Peter...What's Happening."" He goes out of his way to make the employees miserable, from having them work on the weekend, to stealing poor Milton's stapeler, and moving him into the basement. Jennifer Aniston does a nice job as well. Watching her fight with her boss over the pieces of ""flair"" is priceless. The two Bob's played by John C. McGinley and Paul Wilson are hilarious! Last but not least is Stephen Root as Milton. His obsessions with his stapeler and his overall personality will make you laugh and feel sorry for the guy.""Office Space"" is a comedic masterpiece. We can all relate to the story, the laughs are non-stop, and all of the actors are fantastic. My only question is - Why couldn't FOX put out a better DVD? With how funny the movie was, you know there had to be tons of outtakes, and plenty of deleted scenes. So where are they? There are absolutely no special features whatsoever.

For a straight hour and a half you'll be treated to a pure helping of jokes, each which will succeed in making you laugh. With pure Beavis and Butthead humor, Mike Judge's comedy is a winner and deserves to be seen by all comedy fans. Featuring a good cast that includes Stephen Root and John C. McGinley, Office Space is a comedy that you must go out and rent now! Satisfaction guaranteed.Ron Livingston plays a character named Peter Gibbons, a computer guy who works at a company called Initech. He has eight bosses so every time he makes the smallest mistake, he is commented eight times. After several incidents, Peter becomes stressed and decides to go for therapy. When he comes out he decides not to go to work and start enjoying his life.  He tries to spend more time with his girlfriend (Aniston, The Good Girl) and only comes to work to wreck stuff and play games on his computer. However, this attitude lands him a promotion and some of his partners get fired. Anxious for revenge, Peter and his partners decide to perform a scam to steal money from this computer company. Every time the company transfers money, they will get a fraction of every penny. However, instead of the fraction of a cent they're supposed to get, they wind up with over 350,000 dollars. Now, they must figure out away to get themselves out of this situation and not get Gibbons fired.I won't wreck the ending for you but this truly is a great comedy.  The performances are satisying.  Ron Livingston, who we don't see much these days, gives a very good performance as Peter and Jennifer Aniston provides us with a good performance as a waitress and Peter's girlfriend.  John C. McGinley (starring now in the TV show Scrubs) gives a star-making performance as one of Peter's bosses and there are several cameos by people such as Orlando Jones.  The movie is destined to become a comedy classic if people would just not miss it when passing the comedy section at the video store.  Maybe it is a bit over-rated but you still got to see it. Mike Judge is simply a comedic genius. The only bad part about it is that it didn't go on.

What's so great about it is that just about every working person can relate with the characters.  The story revolves around an office worker who is so sick of his boring, stuck in a cubicle all day long job.  His friends at the office (who are extremely funny) feel the same way.  Our main character has a hypnotical experience and is a changed man and no longer worries about the responsibilities that are dragging him down.  To everyone's surprise, his new lackadasical attitude towards life seems to be advancing both his career and personal life.  However, his co-workers are not so fortunate, as the company is downsizing.Office Space packs a bundle of laughs along with a great story and surprisingly good performances.

Would I be wasting a pretty good beer buzz otherwise? The only people I can conceive of disliking Office Space are company presidents, CEO's and complete morons. But, being part of America's office-working automata (and not being a moron), I can relate. I could go on all day about the great jokes, great soundtrack and great characters, but these aren't what make this movie truly great. As paradoxical as it may seem, Mike Judge's true stroke of genius was making a movie that speaks to the majority. Most movies are either fantasies, portrayals of the ultra-elite, or simply gross exaggerations by studio execs of the audience's point of view. For example, movies like The Lord of the Rings are fantasies, where any connection to the viewers' lives is purely metaphorical. Most romantic comedies involve the super-rich and/or the super-attractive, and any romantic struggles these people encounter come off insincere. Finally there are movies like 40 Days and 40 Nights, where some jaded producer thought he could play to the audience's own sexual longings by portraying a protagonist who goes a whole month without intercourse. Right. How many of us can't relate to the anguish of going a month without sex? Call it 40 Score Days and 40 Score Nights and I might begin to take interest. But back to Office Space. This movie appeals to most of us: lazy, underappreciated, unattractive people who hate their jobs and curse at office machines. All of us have felt like Peter Gibbons at one time or another. And this somehow makes our jobs slightly more tolerable, knowing that we're not alone in the corporate dirge. Peter is our hero, our messiah. We all wish we could come to work late, leave early, ignore our boss, dress down, and rip the company off big time...big time. Before this movie, there was no model, no one to show us the way. And, even though few of us will ever reach the level of enlightenment that Peter has, at least we can dream....

You're eagerly anticipating putting your education to good use in an important, meaningful job; having an inspiring boss who will help you reach the full limits of your potential; mingling with interesting, supportive coworkers; and, of course, bringing home a big paycheck.Get real. As the tagline for the hilarious ""Office Space"" so aptly puts it, ""Work sucks."" The live-action writing and directing debut of Mike Judge (creator of the ""Beavis & Butthead"" MTV series) is a hilarious tale of office doldrums that showcases what life is, sadly, often like in the workplace.Ron Livingston (Mikey's friend Rob in ""Swingers"") plays down-on-his-luck Peter Gibbons, a 20-something who hates his job and is on the outs with his girlfriend. In a highly amusing opening sequence, Peter unsuccessfully battles some horrendous traffic on the way to work, and then arrives to his cubicle just in time to be lectured by his superiors for a tiny, inconsequential error he made.It's a brutal day in the life of Peter, but unfortunately it's become the norm. However, when Peter goes to a counseling session with his girlfriend, an unexpected turn of events leads him to a new life philosophy: He doesn't give a s---. He disregards his boss' request that he work during the weekend, hangs up the phone on his (soon-to-be ex) girlfriend, and successfully asks out an attractive waitress he's had his eye on (""Friends'"" Jennifer Aniston). Most significantly, he teams up with two of his coworkers, Samir (Ajay Naidu) and the unfortunately named Michael Bolton (David Herman), in a scam that will potentially screw the company out of thousands of dollars.With the sharply written ""Office Space,"" Mike Judge proves he's more than a one-note wonder by doing a superb job of capturing the malaise of the typical office environment. His most impressive directorial touch is an instantly classic scene in which Peter, Samir and Michael carry the office copying machine to a deserted field and literally kick the crap out of it. Shot in slo-mo and set to a gangsta rap tune, this scene is pure comic genius.Livingston is a good comedic actor who has the talent to become a star in the mold of Matthew Broderick. He gets solid support from Naidu, Herman and Aniston (who deserves credit for taking a small role in this low-budget pic), as well as Gary Cole, who gives a top-notch performance as Peter's super-anal, monotone-voiced boss.Whether you're a student looking for an amusing preview of what's in store for you on the job scene, or an unfortunate sap who's currently experiencing the hell of working in an office, you should get plenty of laughs from the excellent ""Office Space.""",5,The perfect antidote for (another) lackluster day at the office...,1179705600,"05 21, 2007",2007,2749,"['happy', 'day', 'when', 'finally', 'graduate', 'college', 'enter', 'workforce', ""'re"", 'eagerly', 'anticipating', 'putting', 'education', 'good', 'use', 'important', 'meaningful', 'job', 'having', 'inspiring', 'boss', 'who', 'will', 'help', 'reach', 'full', 'limits', 'potential', 'mingling', 'interesting', 'supportive', 'coworkers', 'course', 'bringing', 'home', 'big', 'paycheck.Get', 'real', 'tagline', 'hilarious', 'Office', 'Space', 'so', 'aptly', 'Work', 'sucks', 'live-action', 'writing', 'directing', 'debut', 'Mike', 'Judge', 'creator', 'Beavis', 'Butthead', 'MTV', 'series', 'hilarious', 'tale', 'office', 'doldrums', 'what', 'life', 'sadly', 'often', 'workplace.Ron', 'Livingston', 'Mikey', 'friend', 'Rob', 'Swingers', 'down-on-his-luck', 'Peter', 'Gibbons', '20-something', 'who', 'job', 'outs', 'girlfriend', 'highly', 'amusing', 'opening', 'sequence', 'Peter', 'unsuccessfully', 'horrendous', 'traffic', 'way', 'work', 'then', 'cubicle', 'just', 'time', 'be', 'lectured', 'superiors', 'tiny', 'inconsequential', 'error', 'brutal', 'day', 'life', 'Peter', 'unfortunately', 'become', 'norm', 'However', 'when', 'Peter', 'counseling', 'session', 'girlfriend', 'unexpected', 'turn', 'events', 'new', 'life', 'philosophy', ""n't"", 'give', 's', 'boss', 'request', 'work', 'weekend', 'up', 'phone', 'soon-to-be', 'ex', 'girlfriend', 'successfully', 'out', 'attractive', 'waitress', 'had', 'eye', 'Friends', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Most', 'significantly', 'up', 'two', 'coworkers', 'Samir', 'Ajay', 'Naidu', 'unfortunately', 'named', 'Michael', 'Bolton', 'David', 'Herman', 'scam', 'will', 'potentially', 'screw', 'company', 'thousands', 'dollars.With', 'sharply', 'written', 'Office', 'Space', 'Mike', 'Judge', 'more', 'one-note', 'wonder', 'doing', 'superb', 'job', 'capturing', 'malaise', 'typical', 'office', 'environment', 'most', 'impressive', 'directorial', 'touch', 'instantly', 'classic', 'scene', 'Peter', 'Samir', 'Michael', 'carry', 'office', 'copying', 'machine', 'deserted', 'field', 'literally', 'kick', 'crap', 'Shot', 'slo-mo', 'set', 'gangsta', 'rap', 'tune', 'scene', 'pure', 'comic', 'genius.Livingston', 'good', 'comedic', 'actor', 'who', 'talent', 'become', 'star', 'mold', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'solid', 'support', 'Naidu', 'Herman', 'Aniston', 'who', 'credit', 'taking', 'small', 'role', 'low-budget', 'pic', 'as', 'well', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'who', 'top-notch', 'performance', 'Peter', 'super-anal', 'monotone-voiced', 'boss.Whether', ""'re"", 'student', 'looking', 'amusing', 'preview', 'what', 'store', 'job', 'scene', 'unfortunate', 'sap', 'who', 'currently', 'experiencing', 'hell', 'working', 'office', 'should', 'get', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'excellent', 'Office', 'Space']",Office Space VHS

Ron Livingston plays corporate drone Peter Gibbons who has a totally unhappy and stressed life. Thanks to the only partially intentional assistance from a therapist using hypnosis in the single funniest scene in the film, Peter relaxes and reaps the rewards of sloth. The films makes a legitimate point about promotion up the corporate ladder in the most humorous manner possible.The characters in the film are all caricatures of idealized cubicle dwellers, and remind me of a cross between ""Dilbert"" and the cast of ""The Office."" The film is well acted, and you will see favorite actors from several favorite sitcoms: John C. McGinley from ""Scrubs"" is brilliant as Bob the consultant; Diedrich Bader from ""The Drew Carey Show"" is brilliant as a blue collar neighbor, and Jennifer Aniston shines as Joanna, a waitress with flair!The film deserves five stars save for one misstep in postproduction: the soundtrack. The soundtrack is filled with extremely violent rap music, which not only fails to enhance the film, it actually detracts markedly from it.If you are willing to face life in a cube farm, you need to face up to ""Office Space,"" and check out the extras, too. The deleted scenes are, in several cases, absolute highlights: the scene where Peter confronts the receptionist is absolutely priceless, and justifies the cost of the film alone.",4,"""What Am I Going To Do With 40 Subscriptions To 'Vibe'""?",1214870400,"07 1, 2008",2008,1419,"['Office', 'Space', 'great', 'film', 'brilliant', 'mind', 'Mike', 'Judge', 'Ron', 'Livingston', 'corporate', 'drone', 'Peter', 'Gibbons', 'who', 'totally', 'unhappy', 'stressed', 'life', 'Thanks', 'only', 'partially', 'intentional', 'assistance', 'therapist', 'using', 'hypnosis', 'single', 'funniest', 'scene', 'film', 'Peter', 'relaxes', 'rewards', 'sloth', 'films', 'legitimate', 'point', 'promotion', 'corporate', 'ladder', 'most', 'humorous', 'manner', 'possible.The', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'caricatures', 'idealized', 'cubicle', 'dwellers', 'remind', 'cross', 'Dilbert', 'cast', 'Office', 'film', 'well', 'acted', 'will', 'see', 'favorite', 'actors', 'several', 'favorite', 'sitcoms', 'John', 'C.', 'McGinley', 'Scrubs', 'brilliant', 'Bob', 'consultant', 'Diedrich', 'Bader', 'Drew', 'Carey', 'Show', 'brilliant', 'blue', 'collar', 'neighbor', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Joanna', 'waitress', 'flair', 'film', 'five', 'stars', 'save', 'one', 'misstep', 'postproduction', 'soundtrack', 'soundtrack', 'filled', 'extremely', 'violent', 'rap', 'music', 'not', 'only', 'enhance', 'film', 'actually', 'markedly', 'it.If', 'are', 'willing', 'face', 'life', 'cube', 'farm', 'need', 'face', 'up', 'Office', 'Space', 'check', 'out', 'extras', 'too', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'several', 'cases', 'absolute', 'highlights', 'scene', 'where', 'Peter', 'receptionist', 'absolutely', 'priceless', 'cost', 'film', 'alone']",Office Space VHS

The movie was a complete bust at the box office, which utterly mystifies me, because it is hysterically funny and reflects the experience of millions of people across the United States (and I assume elsewhere).  In an age where companies are seeking to lay off workers at any possible opportunity, this film has perhaps even more relevance now than it did when it came out in 1999.The humor of the film works on multiple levels, but for me so much of it is funny with a twist of the knife, for much of the humor hints at a much more serious fact:  modern work is genuinely dreadful and alienating.  Perhaps many office workers love their job, but I hate mine, and I assume that I am merely one of millions.  No one in this film has a meaningful job.  Even Lumbergh, though the boss, has an absurd position.  Peter Gibbons is at least able to be honest about the ridiculousness of his plight during the incredibly funny sequence in which he is hypnotized.The film is a collection of many, many wonderful moments.  I started laughing from the second that Peter Gibbons gets trapped in the traffic jam and is passed by an old man on a walker, and didn't stop until the very end.  The film is a parade of very funny bits, from Michael Bolton and his passion for gangsta rap to Joanna's boss urging her to wear more flair (played by director Mike Judge) to Peter's neighbor who would yell at him through the walls to Peter's bizarre fantasy in which Lumbergh is making love to Joanna holding a cup of coffee in one hand and her ankle in the other to virtually any conversation involving Lumbergh and Milton.  Some of the humor is a bit too broad.  For instance, although I defy anyone not to find Milton's sequences funny as heck, they don't fit in quite as neatly with the satire of the rest of the film.  I wouldn't, however, want to trade them in for a tighter movie.In a way, this movie has made my life easier to live.  I suspected my job was absurd before seeing this film.  Now I know it is.

The true merit of it lies in showing almost every possible office situation that can happen, while not really exaggerating them.Peter Gibbons (Livingston) works at Initech, a software company like thousands others, in a thankless job checking lines of code for the Y2K glitch. He's numb from all the stupid, meaningless work he and his co-workers, Michael Bolton (no, he's not related to the singer) and Samir Nagheenanajar (&quot;No one in this country can ever pronounce my name right!&quot;), have to do. He has the &uuml;ber boss, Lumbergh (Cole) who makes him work saturdays and who pays very little attention to what Peter says or does. There's also Joanna (Aniston), the waitress from Chotchkie's, the restaurant next door who Peter secretly likes, but has never had the guts to talk to. There's even the consultants, Bob and Bob, who are downsizing the company.Office space is a really fun movie and has gained a little bit of a cult following (especially Gary Cole's character). It also has a great soundtrack, with very clever use of some rap songs. The acting is pretty good, very natural and simple, which goes well with the simple storyline. This is a fine film to own, you'll watch it many times over the years!The movie was based on characters created by Judge (Beavis &amp; Butthead) for a cartoon that used to play on Saturday Night Live, called Milton, for Stephen Root's character, a mousy, mumbling man who works at the office. Judge also makes a cameo of sorts, playing Stan, the manager at the restaurant where Aniston's character works.

(it was my daughter's rental - I'd never heard of it)The opening scene is a traffic jam where an old man  on a walker (beside the roadway) is making more forward progress than Peter  (Ron Livingston) in his little Toyota. You *feel* his pain...That is  how Peter's day begins.From there, we go to problems with &quot;The  Memo&quot; and the cover page for the inter-office report and of course,  some copy machine issues and on and on. (the copy machine does finally get  what it *richly* deserves)The whole scene about &quot;the red  stapler&quot; is just classic comedy. One of the top 10 funniest scenes in  cinematic history.However, the drywall installer (played by Diedrich  Bader) steals the show. Peter asks him &quot;What would you do if somebody  told you 'I think someone has a case of the Mondays?'&quot; to which the  drywaller gives a fair, honest and accurate answer. HILARIOUS!This is  comedy.There are many wordy-dirds throughout the flick, but if you can  get past those, you have a hilarious movie.In our own family, the  classic lines of &quot;Office Space&quot; have become part of our own  vernacular...such as &quot;What's Happening?&quot; and &quot;I was told I  could play my radio...&quot;We *loved* this movie.

He dumps his girlfriend and begins going after a waitress at his favorite haunt (played by Jennifer Aniston). At the same time, his two best friends at his job are about to be fired in a shakedown of the company. Meanwhile Peter is going to be promoted....this is when the hijinks begin. Another great turn in this film is the character of Milton (played by a barely recognizable Stephen Root most known for the boss in NewsRadio). He mumbles constantly, and is put down all the time.

Mike Judge has made the kind of movie where the humor is sometimes dry, but is so incredibly smart that you tend to laugh again and again.The characters in this movie are VERY memorable.  Samir is probably the funniest side character in the history of cinema.  I've never met an Indian (you know, from India) that was as tempermental as he is, but I hope I do someday.  Michael Bolton is awesome.  The guy is just totally down on life.  The whole cast really shines.  Diedrich Bader has a range to his talent that is just amazing (I didn't even recognize him the first two times I saw the film).There really isn't a dull moment to the film.  It was cut so well that it just flows from beginning to end.  It's almost too short, but that's what makes it so easy to watch again.  This is truly a movie that gets funnier the more you watch it.  There are little nuances that you tend to notice after repeated viewings.The only real drawback to the film, and the reason it loses a star, is the fact that the extras are really weak.  There's nothing here that really heightens your appreciation of the film.  I wanted to see deleted scenes (there had to be SOMETHING). I really want to give it five stars, but there are so many other great movies that package equally good extra features.Don't let that deter you from buying the film.

467438,A3SQZCA0JFB5CV,6305499365,S Martin,"[2, 3]","When I first saw Office Space, I hated this movie. I didn't find it funny, and even though my friends jokingly referred to it as where we would be in 10 years (we were all computer engineering majors), I just hated it. The movie has since grown on me, and I think it's one of the best comedies out there.I think what really gives Office Space's it's sheer staying power is that every character is twisted. This is not your normal story with fully fleshed out, dynamic characters who seamlessly fit together. Oh, no. This is stereotypes at their best and brightest. If you've ever worked anywhere with more than 5 people, you're going to associate these stereotypes with your current and former co-workers. There's the woman who never varies from her routine, down to saying the same thing the same way EVERY time; the manager that doesn't actually listen, has the annoying facial tick/movement/phrase; the squirrelly looking mumbling guy that no one pays attention to; the stoner chick with no real life plan, and the young obnoxious guy who's sole goal is to get luck. Not every place I've worked has had everyone one of these stereotypes, but I'm sure I can place at least a couple of them at any job I've ever had.It took me a few viewings to really realize that the movie has two equally entertaining plotlines. The first is Peter, who hates his job, has a girlfriend who's cheating on him, and is always suckered into working on the weekends. We see the movie through his eyes, which has it's ups and downs, including hypnosis, slacking off work, and the new girlfriend that flips off her boss. However, the equally funny, and almost non-sequitor counter story is of Milton, office drone that's stepped on, ignored, made fun of, and worst of all, has his beloved red Swingline stapler stolen. He says so many funny things that it's worth watching the movie a couple times to really get what he's saying. And if you own the More Flair copy, it gets better.This copy was a Christmas present from the same person who gave me a red stapler for my birthday last year. While it's not loaded full of hours upon hours of special features, I did enjoy the making of featurette, where they interview the cast.  You get a wider, more in-depth view of all the characters. My favorite sheds new light on Milton's line and I could see the squirrels, and they were married,"" which is apparently a euphemism for what he actually saw the squirrels doing.  I know it's a funny thing to really gain appreciation for, but it's the bits like that line that make Office Space one of the comedy gems.Not everyone is going to like this movie. If you're one of those people who saw it once and thought it was stupid, humorless, or pointless, watch it again.

Sarhan ""matured reviewer""","[2, 2]","Office Space is a hilarious comedy directed by Mike Judge, the man who brought us Beavis and Butthead (he provided the voices for both characters as well), and starring Ron Livingston, Jennifer Aniston and featuring Mike Judge as an irritating restaurant manager.The reason why many people have liked this film is because it touches upon an issue that is very common amongst people: hating work!Peter Gibbons, played by Livingston, is our hero who is hassled by more than one manager about some memo that he says he recieved but forgot to implement, and hates the fact that his manager always picks on him to come in on Saturdays to finish some leftover work. One day, Gibbons goes to a shrink who hypnotizes him into a complete state of relaxation right before he, the shrink, has a heart attack. Peter becomes carefree. He goes to work when he feels like it wearing jeans and sandals. He even decides to stop going to work, stop paying his bills, and gets the courage to speak out calmly like everything is cool.What happens next is up to you to find out.If you seriously are being hassled at work by your employers, annoyed by everybody and everything from your obnoxious co-workers to that stupid printer that always jams, I really recommend you watch Office Space.A",5,You hate your job?

Friday's restaurant chain, I can say with some authority that Mike Judge based Chotchkie's more on Friday's than on Chili's or  Applebee's or any of those other horrible chains. The &quot;flair&quot;  rules to which Jennifer Anniston's character is forced to adhere are  absolutely dead-on correct. In fact, about the only difference between  Chotchkie's and Friday's is that the vertical stripes on the servers'  shirts are green, not red. &quot;Office Space&quot; is a cult film in that  it really speaks to a certain segment of society to the point of leaving  those outside that segment in the dark. Of course, the number of Americans  who work in cubicles in suburban technology parks (and also in corporate  theme restaurants) number in the millions, so the &quot;Office Space&quot;  cult could be a very large one. Basically, if you work or have worked in  one of these environments, you'll probably love this film. If you haven't,  then it probably won't be so compelling. As far as the plot goes, it's very  wicked and cutting and easy to follow, until Peter's fraud scheme kicks in;  then &quot;Office Space&quot; becomes a rather pedestrian heist flick. But  the first 80% of the film is incredibly funny, with lots of memorable  characters and unforgettable lines.

It seemed that everyone quoted this movie, from the &quot;Didn't you get the memo?&quot; to the famous fax machine scene.I finally got my turn with it last night and was in tears with laughter.  The opening scene with gridlock traffic voiced the pain of millions of commuters and showed the promise of more venting to come in the movie.  With my recent move to cubicle land, I was ready and waiting.To my surprise, this movie actually had a plot.  They developed very humorous office parody in the opening scenes, but I expected that parody to go on for a long time.  Instead, the movie introduces the 3 parallel storylines:- anticipated lay-offs at work with consultants being brought in- Peter's experience with a career hypnotherapist (he's the main character)- Milton's being pushed to the brink of insanityAs the story unwinds, the characters show what ordinary people can do when put in almost inhuman conditions - working on top of people, boring work that doesn't really contribute to anything, inane bosses, an absence of any incentive to work harder, having 8 different bosses, lay-offs not based on merit, being asked to move cubicles continually, etc.More than anything, I appreciated the films ability to continually laugh at itself.  When the 3 main computer science guys consider money laundering, they have to look it up in the dictionary...and they ask how smart guys like them can be so bad at crime when so many stupid people in the mafia are so good at it.  These guys are who we would be if we were stuck in that situation.  Sure, we've heard all about money laundering and such, but who knows how to actually do it?While the movie winds down to a predictable and satisfying ending, I think it works well for this film.  I don't think the magic of the film is its proposing an answer for the white collar worker.  (Ditch digging anyone?)

One wonders why Mike Judge does not direct more.  He's an enormous talent and this movie is dead on target.  Virtually anyone who has work in an office can identify with out of control birthday celebrations, the joy of working in a cubicle, the big bosses creeping around, and the unGodly threat of consultants.I remember my own meeting with a consultant.  Talk about bubble-brained.  I'd love to get paid for a job like that.  And oh..the timesheet thing and multiple job codes.  I swear Judge must have visited the place where I USED to work!  Anyway we've got Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) working to update Y2K software for the company he works for.  He hates it...he's bored with it...and his bosses keep hounding him for TPS reports.  One day he just decides to not show up for work.  He's not quitting..he just isn't going to go anymore.  He comes in finally to pickup his address book and has his meetings with the consultants played marvelously by John C. McGinley and Paul Stewart as the ""Bobs"".Peter explains how he comes in late and only does about 15 minutes of real work in a week.  The Consultants immediately see him as management material and want to promote him!  Classic!  Richard Riehle as Tom Smykowski has a classic meltdown when he meets with the consultants screaming, ""I HAVE PEOPLE SKILLS...I'M GOOD WITH PEOPLE!!!  WHAT THE HELL'S THE MATTER WITH YOU PEOPLE!""  Gary Cole steals the show as smarmy, do-nothing boss Bill Lumbergh whose shallow politeness makes you just want to poke his eyes out.  When Peter finds out two of his buddies are going to be laid off they hatch a plot to infect the accounting software with a virus and move money into an account they've opened.Jennifer Aniston is Joanna who has her own work problems working for one of those generic bar & grill type restaurants and Steven Root is tremendous as the sheepish, squirrely Milton who was supposed to have been laid off five years earlier but was never told.Judge obviously has a great grasp of the office environment and his biting satire of dealing with the firing of employees ought to serve as a swift kick in the butt for all greedy corporate upper management.

Written by Mike Judge (best known for his television work on Beavis &amp; Butthead and King of the Hill), Office Space is a spot-on spoof of what it is like to work in corporate America at the end of the twentieth century.  Ron Livingston plays a Peter Gibboons, a young professional at a software company who is utterly drained by his Dilbert-like existence.  During a hypnotherapy session, he expresses a phrase which crystallizes the work-life of hundreds of thousands of Americans: ""ever since I started working, every single day of my life has been worse than the day before it. So that means that every single day that you see me, that's on the worst day of my life.""In notable supporting roles are: Jennifer Aniston as Peter Gibbons' girlfriend who works as a waitress in a vaguely familiar restaurant where ""flair"" is more important than service; Stephen Root as Milton, the useless, overlooked, middle-aged employee who no one has the guts to fire; Gary Cole as passive-aggressive VP Bill Lumbergh, whom Livingston's Gibbons rightly declares ""represents all that is soulless and wrong;"" Diedrich Bader as Lawrence, Livingston's crude, simple next door neighbor that ultimately shows Gibbons the path to self-fulfillment; and John C. McGinley as one of the Bobs, consultants who have been called in to put a band-aid on the company's problems by doing a time and labor study.Some of the film's cruder moments with Lawrence &amp; office colleague Drew hearken back to Judge's B&amp;B days, but overall, this is an insightful &amp; wildly entertaining movie that manages to crystallize into 89 minutes the dehumanizing effect corporate America has had on American culture around the turn of the millennium.  Not only does the film speak satirical volumes about corporate America, but it also has great insight into the way human beings respond when they are marginalized and subjugated, particularly the liberation that retaliation brings.As for the DVD itself, one can only hope that Fox will someday release this masterpiece in a better edition.  The opening menu pops up with an error message that your computer has a virus, a joke that is not funny under any circumstances.  The only special feature on the disc is the theatrical trailer.  Most blatantly absent is a commentary track from the mastermind, director, and uncredited actor in this comedic tour de force.  Fox execs need to give Mike Judge's masterpiece the treatment it deserves and give its many fans the goodies they desire.",5,"If You Could Watch This, That Would Be Great...",1073952000,"01 13, 2004",2004,2671,"['status', 'modern', 'cult', 'classic', 'frequent', 'replays', 'cable', 'TV', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'still', 'not', 'seen', 'Office', 'Space', 'one', 'funniest', 'movies', '1990s', 'Written', 'Mike', 'Judge', 'best', 'known', 'television', 'work', 'Beavis', 'amp', 'Butthead', 'King', 'Hill', 'Office', 'Space', 'spot-on', 'spoof', 'what', 'work', 'corporate', 'America', 'end', 'twentieth', 'century', 'Ron', 'Livingston', 'Peter', 'Gibboons', 'young', 'professional', 'software', 'company', 'who', 'utterly', 'drained', 'Dilbert-like', 'existence', 'hypnotherapy', 'session', 'phrase', 'work-life', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'Americans', 'ever', 'started', 'working', 'single', 'day', 'life', 'been', 'worse', 'day', 'single', 'day', 'see', 'worst', 'day', 'life', 'notable', 'supporting', 'roles', 'are', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Peter', 'Gibbons', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'waitress', 'vaguely', 'familiar', 'restaurant', 'where', 'flair', 'more', 'important', 'service', 'Stephen', 'Root', 'Milton', 'useless', 'overlooked', 'middle-aged', 'employee', 'who', 'one', 'guts', 'fire', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'passive-aggressive', 'VP', 'Bill', 'Lumbergh', 'whom', 'Livingston', 'Gibbons', 'rightly', 'soulless', 'wrong', 'Diedrich', 'Bader', 'Lawrence', 'Livingston', 'crude', 'simple', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'ultimately', 'Gibbons', 'path', 'self-fulfillment', 'John', 'C.', 'McGinley', 'one', 'Bobs', 'consultants', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'called', 'put', 'band-aid', 'company', 'problems', 'doing', 'time', 'labor', 'study.Some', 'film', 'cruder', 'moments', 'Lawrence', 'amp', 'office', 'colleague', 'Drew', 'back', 'Judge', 'B', 'amp', 'B', 'days', 'overall', 'insightful', 'amp', 'wildly', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'crystallize', '89', 'minutes', 'dehumanizing', 'effect', 'corporate', 'America', 'had', 'American', 'culture', 'turn', 'millennium', 'Not', 'only', 'film', 'speak', 'satirical', 'volumes', 'corporate', 'America', 'also', 'great', 'insight', 'way', 'human', 'beings', 'respond', 'when', 'are', 'marginalized', 'subjugated', 'particularly', 'liberation', 'retaliation', 'brings.As', 'DVD', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'Fox', 'will', 'someday', 'release', 'masterpiece', 'better', 'edition', 'opening', 'menu', 'up', 'error', 'message', 'computer', 'virus', 'joke', 'not', 'funny', 'circumstances', 'only', 'special', 'feature', 'disc', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'Most', 'blatantly', 'absent', 'commentary', 'track', 'mastermind', 'director', 'uncredited', 'actor', 'comedic', 'tour', 'force', 'Fox', 'execs', 'need', 'give', 'Mike', 'Judge', 'masterpiece', 'treatment', 'give', 'many', 'fans', 'goodies', 'desire']",Office Space VHS

As such, the first half of this film is absolutely hilarious. We vicariously live out our dreams to smash the jam-prone printer, knock out a cubicle wall, and skip work for a day of fishing. Fortifying the movie are quirky supporting characters - a white computer geek who listens to gangsta rap, a perpetually cheery temp, a mumbling weirdo, and so forth.The movie does begin to drag a bit during the second half, as the story moves away from office rebellion, to a floundering embezzlement scheme.

467466,A1WWDFQ8HSKT0,6305499365,Vincent M. Mastronardi,"[3, 3]","I recently bought this comedy at the store just due to its low price.  A comedy about working kind of sounded interesting coming from the maker of &quot;Beavis And Butthead&quot; and &quot;King Of The Hill&quot;  sounded  like a good idea.  I expected to laugh out loud and did, but not because of  the plight of hero Peter, but rather the antics of Milton, the mumbling  officer worker that never stands up for himself.The story actually  focuses on Peter (played by Ron Livingston), who is an office worker  struggling through his cubicle-encompassing job at Initech.  His life is a  mess with a girlfirend that cheats on him, the woman of his dreams (played  by Jennifer Anistion) not noticing him and having to put up with a monotone  boss.  After being hypnotized, he realizes he's had enough.  He starts  showing up less at work and when he does he just goofs off.  He also makes  a successful relationship with the girl of his dreams.  Peter also manages  to move up in the ranks with his new neglect for work.  Even with all this  Peter is unhappy because to of his hard working friends get laid off.  They  hatch a plan to rip off Initech and make a few bucks in the process. Of  course, chaos follows.This main story is good for many jokes, but  Peter as the normal guy that goes out of control isn't as funny as the  characters that are thrown in for even more comic relief.  One example is  the construction worker friend of Peter that lives next door.  Deitrich  Bader (from &quot;Drew Carey&quot;) is to funny as Peter's loud fishing  buddy Lawrence.  Joanna (Jennifer) is the best female presence in this  mostly male cast and her &quot;minimal requirement&quot; waitress is so  real and funny.  But the best is by fair Milton, who stutters stammers  through the film as the forgotten worker that is always being pushed in a  corner and treated like garbage.  While the film's story gets kind of slow  as Peter tries to heal things over with his girlfriend and restore the  stolen money, keep your eye on Milton whose abuse is taken to new heights  (&quot;But I didn't get a piece of cake last time.&quot;).  He really makes  me laugh out loud and takes over the movie.  Just to see him in action is  magic.  See the movie for the incredible performance from Stephen Root as  Milton.

467469,A17JVVAKWEB0M,6305499365,Wesley Mullins,"[3, 3]","A few years ago, monster.com instantly became famous with a Super Bowl commercial that featured a group of little children dreaming about growing up to hold unrewarding, miserable jobs.  The kids said things like, ""When I grow up, I wanna file all day...I wanna claw my way up to middle-management...I wanna be a Yes-Man.""  ""Office Space"" tells the story of a group of workers who hold such jobs.Peter, the film's lead character, suffers with the realization that his work has no meaning.  To his company, the workers are simply cogs in the machine, interchangeable and unnecessary.  Their salaries and benefits convince them that they cannot live without their jobs, so they pretend to love their work, constantly justifying and rationalizing employment that numbs the spirit.Peter describes his life as a never-ending string of days that continue to trump the previous with degrees of misery and angst.  He comes to work late, avoids his boss and tries to do as little work as possible, taking pride in the hours each week he spends ""spacing out"" in front of his computer.  He works with equally miserable employees who spend their days dreaming about destroying the copying machine and longing for the former model of stapler that the company once used.After a Jerry Maguire-esque epiphany, Peter decides office cubicle life is not for him and the action of the film is set in place.  His rebellion against his place of employment creates an ironic twist, as his forthright disdain for the procedures and protocols of the company earns him a reputation for honesty and outside-the-box thinking.A subplot grows from Peter's infatuation with a local waitress who finds herself in an equally unrewarding job.  Her boss paradoxically pressures her to seek individuality that conforms to other employees.  She has no problem finding common ground with cubicle slaves who spend their days doing just enough to keep from getting fired.Politically, the film lashes out against jobs that force workers to constantly repeat tasks and procedures until they can do their jobs without thought.  The duties drain workers of creativity and uniqueness, building a graveyard of zombie-like beings who spout out acronyms and lingo in robot-like monotones.  Those familiar with this type of work environment will find the film to be painfully funny.",4,"When I grow up, I wanna file all day",1106438400,"01 23, 2005",2005,2333,"['few', 'years', 'ago', 'instantly', 'became', 'famous', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'commercial', 'featured', 'group', 'little', 'children', 'dreaming', 'growing', 'up', 'hold', 'unrewarding', 'miserable', 'jobs', 'kids', 'said', 'things', 'When', 'grow', 'up', 'wan', 'file', 'day', 'wan', 'na', 'claw', 'way', 'middle-management', 'wan', 'na', 'be', 'Yes-Man', 'Office', 'Space', 'story', 'group', 'workers', 'who', 'hold', 'such', 'jobs.Peter', 'film', 'lead', 'character', 'suffers', 'realization', 'work', 'meaning', 'company', 'workers', 'are', 'simply', 'cogs', 'machine', 'interchangeable', 'unnecessary', 'salaries', 'benefits', 'convince', 'can', 'not', 'live', 'jobs', 'pretend', 'love', 'work', 'constantly', 'justifying', 'rationalizing', 'employment', 'spirit.Peter', 'life', 'never-ending', 'string', 'days', 'continue', 'trump', 'previous', 'degrees', 'misery', 'angst', 'work', 'late', 'boss', 'tries', 'do', 'as', 'little', 'work', 'possible', 'taking', 'pride', 'hours', 'week', 'spacing', 'out', 'front', 'computer', 'equally', 'miserable', 'employees', 'who', 'spend', 'days', 'dreaming', 'destroying', 'copying', 'machine', 'longing', 'former', 'model', 'stapler', 'company', 'once', 'used.After', 'Jerry', 'Maguire-esque', 'epiphany', 'Peter', 'office', 'cubicle', 'life', 'not', 'action', 'film', 'set', 'place', 'rebellion', 'place', 'employment', 'ironic', 'twist', 'forthright', 'disdain', 'procedures', 'protocols', 'company', 'reputation', 'honesty', 'outside-the-box', 'thinking.A', 'subplot', 'grows', 'Peter', 'infatuation', 'local', 'waitress', 'who', 'equally', 'unrewarding', 'job', 'boss', 'paradoxically', 'seek', 'individuality', 'other', 'employees', 'problem', 'finding', 'common', 'ground', 'cubicle', 'slaves', 'who', 'spend', 'days', 'doing', 'just', 'enough', 'keep', 'getting', 'fired.Politically', 'film', 'out', 'jobs', 'force', 'workers', 'constantly', 'repeat', 'tasks', 'procedures', 'can', 'do', 'jobs', 'thought', 'duties', 'drain', 'workers', 'creativity', 'uniqueness', 'building', 'graveyard', 'zombie-like', 'beings', 'who', 'spout', 'out', 'acronyms', 'lingo', 'robot-like', 'monotones', 'familiar', 'type', 'work', 'environment', 'will', 'find', 'film', 'be', 'painfully', 'funny']",Office Space VHS
467470,A3N5XIM9R2OQH0,6305499365,Wheelchair Assassin,"[8, 8]","In less stressful times during and immediately after college, I was a huge &quot;Office Space&quot; fan.  I bought it on video, watched it a bunch of times, quoted it relentlessly (and still do) with my roommate, and generally considered it to be a funny, intelligent comedy.  I had never actually worked in an office, but I imagined the movie to be a fairly accurate depiction of what the experience is like and what it does to the typical cubicle slave.  In other words, I liked the movie, but in much the same way I liked lots of other movies.Then, a few months ago, I got an office job with an enormous corporation, and I now see the world of &quot;Office Space&quot; in a whole new light.  It's still funny, but there's also a major undercurrent of depression beneath the humor.  The movie's fictional Initech Corp. is a sterile suburban hell, where the bosses have become patronizing phonies and the workers are bitter and frustrated over their precarious, unfulfilling existence.  My job isn't quite as bad, but few hours go by where I don't think of some line from the movie and realize just how accurately it describes what I go through on a daily basis.  Human beings really aren't supposed to sit around at desks staring at computer screens all day, and &quot;Office Space&quot; perfectly captures the quiet despair that corporate lemmingdom can produce.  At one point protagonist Peter Gibbons flatly states, &quot;I don't like my job.  I don't think I'm gonna go anymore.&quot;  I'm sure many would like to say the same thing, but unfortunately in real life it doesn't prove to be that easy.Viewed in this light, &quot;Office Space&quot; could only have worked as a comedy.  For one thing it requires a razor-sharp satire, which this movie very much is, to truly highlight the absurdity of the situations faced on a daily basis in offices nationwide.  For another, if the movie's examination of life on the lower rungs of corporate America weren't lightened with some laughs, viewers would be reaching for arsenic and razorblades in record time.  Ron Livingston brings a definite everyman appeal to the role of Peter: you can sympathize with Peter's plight because you've probably been there, and even if you haven't you'll still be able to feel his pain because Livingston communicates it so well.  Not to mention, Gary Cole gives one of THE most underappreciated performances in cinematic history as Bill Lumbergh, Peter's &quot;evil, disgusting pig of a boss.&quot;  Sure, Lumbergh's a caricature, but Cole delivers his condescending lines with such perfect tone and expression that they still haven't stopped being funny after about ten viewings.  Plus, in case you need any more reason to watch, the cast also includes the always-hilarious Diedrich Bader and the always-smoking Jennifer Aniston.As the plot progresses, &quot;Office Space&quot; brings in an element of wish fulfillment when Peter decides he has nothing left to lose and he might as well see what it takes to get fired.  For most of its hilarious middle third the movie plays on this strain of insubordination, becoming the ultimate workplace fantasy as Peter disrespects his higher-ups and generally acts destructive around the office.  There's also a scheme to rip off the company thrown in, but that's not really important.  &quot;Office Space&quot; is so good the plot is rendered more or less secondary.  Watch it, and drop out for an hour and a half.",5,&quot;Looks like somebody's got a case of the Mondays...&quot;,1068854400,"11 15, 2003",2003,3439,"['less', 'stressful', 'times', 'immediately', 'college', 'was', 'huge', 'quot', 'Office', 'Space', 'quot', 'fan', 'bought', 'video', 'watched', 'bunch', 'times', 'quoted', 'relentlessly', 'still', 'do', 'roommate', 'generally', 'considered', 'be', 'funny', 'intelligent', 'comedy', 'had', 'never', 'actually', 'worked', 'office', 'imagined', 'movie', 'be', 'fairly', 'accurate', 'depiction', 'what', 'experience', 'what', 'typical', 'cubicle', 'slave', 'other', 'words', 'liked', 'movie', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'liked', 'lots', 'other', 'movies.Then', 'few', 'months', 'got', 'office', 'job', 'enormous', 'corporation', 'now', 'see', 'world', 'quot', 'Office', 'Space', 'quot', 'whole', 'new', 'light', 'still', 'funny', 'also', 'major', 'undercurrent', 'depression', 'humor', 'movie', 'fictional', 'Initech', 'Corp.', 'sterile', 'suburban', 'hell', 'where', 'bosses', 'have', 'become', 'patronizing', 'phonies', 'workers', 'are', 'bitter', 'frustrated', 'precarious', 'unfulfilling', 'existence', 'job', ""n't"", 'quite', 'bad', 'few', 'hours', 'go', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'line', 'movie', 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'accurately', 'what', 'go', 'daily', 'basis', 'Human', 'beings', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'sit', 'around', 'desks', 'staring', 'computer', 'screens', 'day', 'quot', 'Office', 'Space', 'quot', 'perfectly', 'quiet', 'despair', 'corporate', 'lemmingdom', 'can', 'produce', 'one', 'point', 'protagonist', 'Peter', 'Gibbons', 'flatly', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'job', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'m"", 'gon', 'go', 'anymore.', 'quot', ""'m"", 'sure', 'many', 'would', 'like', 'say', 'same', 'thing', 'unfortunately', 'real', 'life', ""n't"", 'prove', 'be', 'easy.Viewed', 'light', 'quot', 'Office', 'Space', 'quot', 'could', 'only', 'have', 'worked', 'comedy', 'one', 'thing', 'razor-sharp', 'satire', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'truly', 'absurdity', 'situations', 'faced', 'daily', 'basis', 'offices', 'nationwide', 'movie', 'examination', 'life', 'lower', 'rungs', 'corporate', 'America', 'were', ""n't"", 'lightened', 'laughs', 'viewers', 'would', 'be', 'reaching', 'arsenic', 'razorblades', 'record', 'time', 'Ron', 'Livingston', 'definite', 'everyman', 'appeal', 'role', 'Peter', 'can', 'sympathize', 'Peter', 'plight', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'been', 'there', 'even', 'have', ""n't"", ""'ll"", 'still', 'be', 'able', 'feel', 'pain', 'Livingston', 'so', 'well', 'Not', 'mention', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'one', 'most', 'underappreciated', 'performances', 'cinematic', 'history', 'Bill', 'Lumbergh', 'Peter', 'quot', 'disgusting', 'pig', 'boss.', 'quot', 'Sure', 'Lumbergh', 'caricature', 'Cole', 'condescending', 'lines', 'such', 'perfect', 'tone', 'expression', 'still', 'have', ""n't"", 'stopped', 'being', 'funny', 'ten', 'viewings', 'case', 'need', 'more', 'reason', 'watch', 'cast', 'also', 'always-hilarious', 'Diedrich', 'Bader', 'always-smoking', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston.As', 'plot', 'quot', 'Office', 'Space', 'quot', 'brings', 'element', 'wish', 'fulfillment', 'when', 'Peter', 'nothing', 'left', 'lose', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'see', 'what', 'get', 'fired', 'most', 'hilarious', 'middle', 'movie', 'strain', 'insubordination', 'becoming', 'ultimate', 'workplace', 'fantasy', 'Peter', 'higher-ups', 'generally', 'destructive', 'office', 'also', 'scheme', 'rip', 'off', 'company', 'thrown', 'not', 'really', 'important', 'quot', 'Office', 'Space', 'quot', 'so', 'good', 'plot', 'rendered', 'more', 'less', 'secondary', 'Watch', 'drop', 'out', 'hour', 'half']",Office Space VHS

If you've never seen it and you're wondering what my hype towards it is all about, let me give you a little tour of the plot:Peter Gibbins is an I would assume around the age of 25 year-old office worker who couldn't possibly hate his job more than he hates it now... From the traffic jam in the morning where an old man in a walker makes better forward progress than him, to getting a shock when he touches the door to walk in, to listening to that fat red-haired lady say ""JUUUST A MOOMMEEENNNT"" non-stop, and of course, hearing those 4 favorite words of his: ""Hello Peter,, what's happening?"" from his boss, Bill Lumbergh, played hillariously by Gary Cole, and of course there's also that printer that always says ""Paper jam"" when there IS no paper jam. Then one day, Peter realizes that ""humans were not meant to spend their short lives sitting in a cubicle staring at computer screens all day, listening to 8 different bosses moan on about mission statements"", and just decides, ""I'm not gonna go anymore"", and it all goes downhill from there....... (That's all I'll tell, dont wanna ruin it :)Other great characters include his 2 friends/coworkers, Michael Bolton (just a coincidence, no relation)- a computer nerd who loves rap music and states that ""I shouldn't change my name, HE'S the one who sucks!"", and Samir, an Arabian who really doesn't like that printer..., and then of course there's the great Milton Waddams, who just wants his stapler back, his paycheck, not to move his desk again, and a piece of cake.. and Tom Smikowski, the old guy who constantly worries about getting laid off, and Drew, the young laid-back guy who just wants to show a girl his OHH face (the ""HOW LUMBERGH F*CKED HER"" thing cracks me up every time :)  But of course my favorite character would probably be Peter's next door neighbor Lawrence, who just wants Peter to ""Check out channel 9!""This will be a comedy you will easily love and relate to if you have a job or class you really don't like to get up every morning to go to.. trust me, I'VE had plenty of em....This movie also has some great tunes to go with it- ""I Got This Killer Up Inside of Me"", the song that Michael sings in his car in the morning, that is until a black guy walks by... ""Die Motherf*ckers Die"", the ultimate printer-smashing song, ""Damn It Feels Good to Be A Gangster"", the perfect ""I-don't-care-and-I-feel-great-about-it"" song, and of course, the ""Take This Job and Shove It(I Aint Workin Here No More)"" song played in the end credits is priceless...If you want a good comedy, you WILL NOT be dissapointed AT ALL! Trust me, this movie has lines that you will leave as quotes for your AIM away messages for years and years to come :)You can go watch that 'Lizzie McGuire' movie if you want, but,,in conclusion, I have 6 final words: TAKE THIS JOB AND SHOVE IT!!!!!!GREATESTMOVIEEVER :)",5,"I CANT RESIST, I HAVE TO REVIEW THIS AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1071100800,"12 11, 2003",2003,3030,"[""'ve"", 'read', 'most', 'reviews', 'lists', ""So-You'd-Like-To"", 'things', 'know', 'i', 'REALLY', 'REAAALLLY', 'movie', 'yes', 'sir', 'FAVORITE', 'MOVIE', 'ALL', 'TIME', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', ""'re"", 'wondering', 'what', 'hype', 'let', 'give', 'little', 'tour', 'plot', 'Peter', 'Gibbins', 'would', 'assume', 'age', '25', 'year-old', 'office', 'worker', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'hate', 'job', 'more', 'now', 'traffic', 'jam', 'morning', 'where', 'old', 'man', 'walker', 'better', 'forward', 'progress', 'getting', 'shock', 'when', 'door', 'walk', 'listening', 'fat', 'red-haired', 'lady', 'say', 'JUUUST', 'MOOMMEEENNNT', 'non-stop', 'course', 'hearing', '4', 'favorite', 'words', 'Hello', 'Peter', 'what', 'happening', 'boss', 'Bill', 'Lumbergh', 'played', 'hillariously', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'course', 'also', 'printer', 'always', 'Paper', 'jam', 'when', 'paper', 'jam', 'Then', 'one', 'day', 'Peter', 'humans', 'were', 'not', 'meant', 'spend', 'short', 'lives', 'sitting', 'cubicle', 'staring', 'computer', 'screens', 'day', 'listening', '8', 'different', 'bosses', 'moan', 'mission', 'statements', 'just', 'decides', ""'m"", 'not', 'gon', 'go', 'anymore', 'downhill', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'dont', 'wan', 'ruin', 'Other', 'great', 'characters', 'include', '2', 'friends/coworkers', 'Michael', 'Bolton', 'just', 'coincidence', 'relation', 'computer', 'nerd', 'who', 'rap', 'music', 'should', ""n't"", 'change', 'name', 'HE', 'one', 'who', 'Samir', 'Arabian', 'who', 'really', ""n't"", 'like', 'printer', 'then', 'course', 'great', 'Milton', 'Waddams', 'who', 'just', 'stapler', 'back', 'paycheck', 'not', 'move', 'desk', 'again', 'piece', 'cake..', 'Tom', 'Smikowski', 'old', 'guy', 'who', 'constantly', 'getting', 'laid', 'off', 'Drew', 'young', 'laid-back', 'guy', 'who', 'just', 'show', 'girl', 'OHH', 'face', 'HOW', 'LUMBERGH', 'F*CKED', 'HER', 'thing', 'cracks', 'time', 'course', 'favorite', 'character', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'Peter', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'Lawrence', 'who', 'just', 'Peter', 'Check', 'channel', '9', 'will', 'be', 'comedy', 'will', 'easily', 'love', 'relate', 'have', 'job', 'class', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'get', 'up', 'morning', 'go', 'to..', 'trust', ""'VE"", 'had', 'plenty', 'em', '.This', 'movie', 'also', 'great', 'tunes', 'go', 'it-', 'Got', 'Killer', 'Up', 'Inside', 'Me', 'song', 'Michael', 'sings', 'car', 'morning', 'black', 'guy', 'walks', 'Die', 'Motherf*ckers', 'Die', 'ultimate', 'printer-smashing', 'song', 'Damn', 'Feels', 'Good', 'Be', 'Gangster', 'perfect', ""I-don't-care-and-I-feel-great-about-it"", 'song', 'course', 'Take', 'Job', 'Shove', 'Aint', 'Workin', 'Here', 'No', 'More', 'song', 'played', 'end', 'priceless', 'want', 'good', 'comedy', 'WILL', 'NOT', 'be', 'dissapointed', 'AT', 'ALL', 'Trust', 'movie', 'lines', 'will', 'leave', 'quotes', 'AIM', 'away', 'years', 'years', 'come', 'can', 'go', 'watch', ""'Lizzie"", 'McGuire', 'movie', 'want', ',in', 'conclusion', 'have', '6', 'final', 'words', 'TAKE', 'THIS', 'JOB', 'AND', 'SHOVE', 'IT', 'GREATESTMOVIEEVER']",Office Space VHS

(I'll try any movie for $1.)... I'm proud to say that after renting it in excess of five times, we finally broke down and bought it.  A better purchase I could not have made!This movie is clever, hilarious, and populated with some great characters.  Also, it's infinitely quotable, and nearly every scene rings true.  Thank goodness Mike Judge departed from Beavis &amp; Butthead to make this gem of a cinematic masterpiece.  (Okay, you might not file it next to &quot;The Godfather,&quot; but you would definitely put it somewhere between the Marx Brothers and Wes Anderson/Owen Wilson's &quot;Bottle Rocket&quot;)  Make that comedic masterpiece.  For my money, it doesn't get much better than when John C. McGinley gives his monologue about Michael Bolton, or when Diedrich Bader comes over as the friendly neighbor, or when Mike Judge cameos and talks about &quot;flair,&quot; or when vengeance is taken on a certain office appliance... you get the idea.  (As I was making that list, about eight other favorite scenes popped into my head).If you haven't seen it, give it a try.

Then, there are those for whom the exact opposite to all three of those statements.  ""Office Space"" is for that latter group.For a basic plot summary, ""Office Space"" focuses primarily on Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston), a beaten-down cubicle drone who is just going through his life/job on autopilot.  When a visit to a hypnotherapist goes horribly wrong, however, Peter snaps out of his funk & starts doing things on his own terms...with predictable hilarious results!Where this movie really succeeds is that it perfectly captures the essence of an un-fulfilling work environment.  Most anyone who has ever held a job can relate, but those (like myself) who have lived a ""job from hell"" scenario will cringe all the more and laugh all the heartier.The auxiliary cast is also spectacular.  Gary Cole as boss ""Bill Lumbergh"" has now become a classic performance, while such actors as Stephen Root (""Milton), Jennifer Aniston (""Joanna""), David Herman (""Michael Bolton""), & Ajay Naidu (""Samir"") turn in spot-on comedic gems.I consider this to be one of my favorite films of all-time for its ability to capture (through humor and satire, of course) the dysfunctional work environment.  If you haven't ""lived it"", then perhaps this type of humor will not appeal to you.
