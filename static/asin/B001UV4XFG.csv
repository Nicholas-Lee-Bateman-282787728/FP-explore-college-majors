Burchfield,"[0, 0]","As always, I liked the book better than the movie but at least I could tell- even in a 30 second TV spot- where the &#34;changed&#34; bits related to the book. Adding Riley's backstory was a nice touch.I'm not sure who was the &#34;best&#34; actor/actress this time out but I liked everything about Nikki Reed's delivery on her role as Rosalie from her telling Bela about her last human days to the fight training and battle scenes. The big battle barely resembled the book version but at least it was better than the Edward/Victoria-Seth/Riley mini battle which wasn't very good at all, shot on a set didn't help it at all. Bryce-Dallas Howard or Rachelle  Lefevre as Victoria?, not sure who's the better choice there.The movie does look good overall and should at least &#34;get by&#34; for most fans, those new to Twilight will find plenty to watch even if you don't know all of the backstory.When I bought my copy of the &#34;special 2 disc edition&#34; of the DVD I also bought the Blu ray Amazon listed below it.

I will talk about this specific edition: Blu-ray, movie only.Those who care about extras and especially those who have friends who could use the included DVD are probably better off with the Blu/DVD combo edition. For those who only wish to watch the move, this is as good as the premium bundle and can be had for a few dollars less.This is what you get:- MOVIE ONLY - there are NO extras whatsoever- BD Live (not an extra) gives access to trailers and other marketing material- English and Spanish subtitles only- Spanish is the only alternate audio track- 1080p, 2.40:1 video- DTS-HD Master Audio (English) and Dolby Digital 5.1 (Spanish) sound- Cheap Blu case, the kind where the plastic has holes carved in it to save a few penniesI knew what I was doing when I ordered this edition because my long-term plan is to sell the individual movies and get the final 'boxed' edition holding all movies but I did miss the extras.For what it is, I can't find much to complain about this 'movie only' edition.

I own the other two films, while preferring the plot of New Moon to the 1st film.  I don't feel, even in the books, Edward gets developed well until at least Eclipse. Bella's ""addiction"" (as Jacob refers to it) fails to make any sense, given how little she knows Edward. Anyway, I loved the action sequences in this film; I would have liked more of them.  It seems the best action sequences were in the trailer ads for the film. Personally, I view Victoria's hold over Riley in the book as seductive or sexual. Bryce Dallas Howard can't DO seductive, so her character's hold on Riley in the film is inexplicable. Rochelle was much better as Victoria. I also wish that Warner Brothers, who also went cheap with Harry Potter after the first few films, would advance the money for them to rehire Carter Burwell for the music. He set mood beautifully in the first film. All the composers, though well-known for composing other film soundtracks, hired since Burwell are mediocre for this series.

1240026,AKJONKU5DALMF,B001UV4XFG,"A.Marte ""Supernatural  Lover""","[3, 3]","After reading the first book a few months ago, I decided to watch Twilight. The first film, while low in budget, was a lot better. This could be because the idea and/or actors were ""fresh,"" I do not know which. The second film was pretty bad: there were pacing issues, issues with hair and make-up, and issues with the acting. The third film fares a little better; there were two major flaws, everyone's wigs and the speech that Bella made at the end.Eclipse picks up right where New Moon left off, Bella and Edward are happy together. He wants her to marry him as a stipulation for turning her. She has shallow reason why she does not want to marry him; even though she wants to commit to eternal after life? If you follow the saga, then you know that the werewolves hate the vampires.....etc. Victoria comes back wanting revenge and she is played by someone different. She builds a newborn army to take out Bella. Possibly to eliminate the Cullen's as well or just because she does not want the Volturi to know. The werewolves form a truce and work together to save Forks from newborn annihilation. Two of the Cullen's are allowed to speak on their back stories. Bella agrees to marry Edward, they hide in a tent for her to be safe. The tent scene from the book happens. Jacob tries to force his love on Bella, he learns of their impending marriage and the fights happens. It ends with Bella's speech.The Good:The cinematography was beautiful, the pacing of this story was done better. Everyone accept for Kirsten has improved in the acting department. Pivotal scenes from the book are executed well. Riley and Bree were perfectly cast and the the action scenes were a lot better. I am glad the third wife scene was cut down. Imprinting was explained better and they left out the Quil/Claire stuff.The Bad:Everyone's hair was a mess, I know Kristen shot this after filming the Runaways; but that wig was just vomit-inducing. Jasper hair and the general style of a lot of characters was just bad; it kept me from getting thoroughly lost in the film. We do not hear much from Jasper but in the first films he seemed to have a lisp, now it is a southern accent? Bella, in the books, does not actually engage Rosalie to hear her back story, so I found this a little odd. None of the werewolves look like they should be grown or at the age of 25. The execution of Jacobs love for Bella came off poorly, I never saw the love, just a douche bag.Kirsten has no chemistry with Robert or Taylor, on film: I could not SEE why either would want her, there was barely any signs of fun; just Kristen biting her nails. It is inferred that the Volturi knew about the newborns but allowing Jane, etc to watch them create havoc was confusing; is it foreshadowing, I thought that was just an errant thought? The last thing was the speech at the end. The books sort of meld together but Bella was really sad over ""losing"" Jacob. This was never explored, instead Bella talks about belonging with the Cullen's, truly wanted to be a monster because she did not fit in; there was no need for the speech. It seem trite and pedestrian.I prefer the films to the books because a lot of unnerving themes are left out{cough Quil}, so I would recommend seeing it once because it is entertaining. It is a dramedy, you might awwwww!! and you might find it romantic but there are definitely some laughs, just those wigs alone.",3,"Better than the second, not as good as the first......",1294963200,"01 14, 2011",2011,3394,"['reading', 'first', 'book', 'few', 'months', 'decided', 'watch', 'Twilight', 'first', 'film', 'low', 'budget', 'was', 'lot', 'better', 'could', 'be', 'idea', 'and/or', 'actors', 'were', 'fresh', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'second', 'film', 'was', 'pretty', 'bad', 'were', 'pacing', 'issues', 'issues', 'hair', 'make-up', 'issues', 'acting', 'third', 'film', 'little', 'better', 'were', 'two', 'major', 'flaws', 'everyone', 'wigs', 'speech', 'Bella', 'made', 'end.Eclipse', 'up', 'right', 'where', 'New', 'Moon', 'left', 'off', 'Bella', 'Edward', 'are', 'happy', 'together', 'marry', 'stipulation', 'turning', 'shallow', 'reason', 'why', 'not', 'want', 'marry', 'even', 'commit', 'eternal', 'life', 'follow', 'saga', 'then', 'know', 'werewolves', 'hate', 'vampires', '..etc', 'Victoria', 'back', 'wanting', 'revenge', 'played', 'someone', 'different', 'newborn', 'army', 'take', 'out', 'Bella', 'Possibly', 'eliminate', 'Cullen', 'as', 'well', 'just', 'not', 'want', 'Volturi', 'know', 'werewolves', 'form', 'truce', 'work', 'together', 'save', 'Forks', 'newborn', 'annihilation', 'Two', 'Cullen', 'are', 'allowed', 'speak', 'back', 'stories', 'Bella', 'marry', 'Edward', 'hide', 'tent', 'be', 'safe', 'tent', 'scene', 'book', 'Jacob', 'force', 'love', 'Bella', 'impending', 'marriage', 'fights', 'Bella', 'speech.The', 'Good', 'cinematography', 'was', 'beautiful', 'pacing', 'story', 'was', 'done', 'better', 'Everyone', 'accept', 'Kirsten', 'improved', 'acting', 'department', 'Pivotal', 'scenes', 'book', 'are', 'executed', 'well', 'Riley', 'Bree', 'were', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'action', 'scenes', 'were', 'lot', 'better', 'am', 'glad', 'third', 'wife', 'scene', 'was', 'cut', 'down', 'Imprinting', 'was', 'explained', 'better', 'left', 'out', 'Quil/Claire', 'stuff.The', 'Bad', 'Everyone', 'hair', 'was', 'mess', 'know', 'Kristen', 'shot', 'filming', 'Runaways', 'wig', 'was', 'just', 'vomit-inducing', 'Jasper', 'hair', 'general', 'style', 'lot', 'characters', 'was', 'just', 'bad', 'kept', 'getting', 'thoroughly', 'lost', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'hear', 'much', 'Jasper', 'first', 'films', 'seemed', 'have', 'lisp', 'now', 'southern', 'accent', 'Bella', 'books', 'not', 'actually', 'engage', 'Rosalie', 'hear', 'back', 'story', 'found', 'little', 'odd', 'None', 'werewolves', 'look', 'should', 'be', 'grown', 'age', '25', 'execution', 'Jacobs', 'love', 'Bella', 'came', 'off', 'poorly', 'never', 'saw', 'love', 'just', 'douche', 'bag.Kirsten', 'chemistry', 'Robert', 'Taylor', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'SEE', 'why', 'would', 'want', 'was', 'barely', 'signs', 'fun', 'just', 'Kristen', 'biting', 'nails', 'inferred', 'Volturi', 'knew', 'newborns', 'allowing', 'Jane', 'etc', 'watch', 'create', 'havoc', 'was', 'confusing', 'foreshadowing', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'errant', 'thought', 'last', 'thing', 'was', 'speech', 'end', 'books', 'sort', 'meld', 'together', 'Bella', 'was', 'really', 'sad', 'losing', 'Jacob', 'was', 'never', 'explored', 'instead', 'Bella', 'talks', 'belonging', 'Cullen', 'truly', 'wanted', 'be', 'monster', 'did', 'not', 'fit', 'was', 'need', 'speech', 'seem', 'trite', 'pedestrian.I', 'prefer', 'films', 'books', 'lot', 'unnerving', 'themes', 'are', 'left', 'out', 'cough', 'Quil', 'so', 'would', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'once', 'entertaining', 'dramedy', 'might', 'awwwww', 'might', 'find', 'romantic', 'are', 'definitely', 'laughs', 'just', 'wigs', 'alone']",N/A

They aimed it for an older audience in my opinion, and who could resist Jacob telling Edward that he (Jacob) is just hotter (than Edward)?What I don't like is only having an option for a blu ray with no special features, or a blu ray disc with the dvd right on the same disc.  The whole point of having both formats is in case of damage, or to lend one to a friend and still be able to keep your copy...in my opinion it was a cheap out on the part of the manufacturer, seriously, how much more could it have cost to put them on separate discs?  I would have paid an extra buck to have blu ray and dvd separated from each other.  I just hope this isn't the start of a new trend in blu ray manufacture!Or, put the special features on a simple blu ray release.

The disc quality is better than the summit version I first purchased.This review is about the DVD options to purchase. It is NOT about the movie which I thought was SPECTACULAR. Every year we do this song and dance with Summit all because of these ""exclusive"" contracts they have with different retailers. I wanted the blu- ray dvd plus a seperate dvd for roadtrips INCLUDING the special features.Summit released NO SUCH VERSION!Option A: Blu ray only (NO special features)Option B: Blu ray + DVD combo single FLIPPER DISK!

Other studios will offer the blu ray + reg. dvd AND a DIGITAL COPY for the SAME PRICE that Summit has set for their merchandise! Summit can suck it!WHY FLIPPERS SUCK:Most of the problem with flippers comes from inconsistent manufacturing quality (and format quality). The discs that are used for blu rays have higher formating standard than that of a regular dvd. A dual disc ( blu ray one side/ dvd on the other) currently, does NOT confirm to the standards set for the blu ray format. Blu rays have higher storage capacity and better scratch resistance. If this disc format is NOT used to make the blu ray then you LOSE quality AND durability.The stand alone blu ray dvd is the only true Blu ray in correct format... too bad u have to sacrifice the bonus footage (as currently package by Summit) in order to get it!Update: I just watched the movie and unfortunately the Blu ray quality sucks.Wish I had purchased the stand alone Blu ray disc and sacrificed the extras. *sad face*Update #2: Went to Target and purchased their version.

My initial reaction was that it's a terrible sequel. To give is a fair chance, I bought the DVD and saw it twice again, once on it's own and then again as part of my weekend movie marathon from Twilight to New Moon to Eclipse.So what's wrong with the movie?1. The sweetness and magical fantasy weaved in the first 2 movies was totally non-existent in this movie - it felt too 'real-life', like some action movie.2. The camera angles felt too close when compared to the first 2 movies, and it felt almost like it was ""in your face"" too much.3. The hair on the key characters look really fake or awkward, and the skin tone was either a weird shade of pale or bronzy in some scenes.4. Bryce Dallas Howard as Victoria was totally disorientating - she played the character so differently that it was clearly 2 different personalities. They should have stuck with the same actress throughout the 3 movies.5. The music was too loud or too epic like - the bedroom proposal scene music was way too loud and it totally destroyed the mood of the scene. The music at the end of the movie was too epic like, too LOTR (I have done the LOTR movie marathon enough times to recognize Howard Shore's touch anywhere - and the Twilight Saga is not LOTR).David Slade and Howard Shore are both great artists and great in what they do, but I personally feel that they have not understood what Catherine Hardwicke and Chris Weitz had done in the earlier movies. Where New Moon picked up the mood and transitioned well from Twilight, the transition from New Moon to Eclipse is not there.I hope they don't destroy the next 2 movies that they are making from the last book.",2,Good movie but terrible Twilight sequel,1293840000,"01 1, 2011",2011,1982,"['are', 'watching', 'stand', 'alone', 'movie', 'would', 'say', 'decent', 'movie', 'lots', 'action', 'scenes', 'romance', 'thrown', 'in.But', 'part', 'Twilight', 'Saga', 'have', 'say', 'movie', 'disaster', 'Let', 'start', 'stating', 'thousands', 'Twifans', 'had', 'eagerly', 'waited', 'movie', 'saw', 'opening', 'day', 'initial', 'reaction', 'was', 'terrible', 'sequel', 'give', 'fair', 'chance', 'bought', 'DVD', 'saw', 'twice', 'again', 'once', 'own', 'then', 'again', 'part', 'weekend', 'movie', 'marathon', 'Twilight', 'New', 'Moon', 'Eclipse.So', 'what', 'wrong', 'movie', '1', 'sweetness', 'magical', 'fantasy', 'weaved', 'first', '2', 'movies', 'was', 'totally', 'non-existent', 'movie', 'felt', 'too', ""'real-life"", 'action', 'movie.2', 'camera', 'felt', 'too', 'close', 'when', 'compared', 'first', '2', 'movies', 'felt', 'almost', 'was', 'face', 'too', 'much.3', 'hair', 'key', 'characters', 'look', 'really', 'fake', 'awkward', 'skin', 'tone', 'was', 'weird', 'shade', 'pale', 'bronzy', 'scenes.4', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'Victoria', 'was', 'totally', 'disorientating', 'played', 'character', 'so', 'differently', 'was', 'clearly', '2', 'different', 'personalities', 'should', 'have', 'stuck', 'same', 'actress', '3', 'movies.5', 'music', 'was', 'too', 'loud', 'too', 'epic', 'bedroom', 'proposal', 'scene', 'music', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'loud', 'totally', 'destroyed', 'mood', 'scene', 'music', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'too', 'epic', 'too', 'LOTR', 'have', 'done', 'LOTR', 'movie', 'marathon', 'enough', 'times', 'recognize', 'Howard', 'Shore', 'touch', 'anywhere', 'Twilight', 'Saga', 'not', 'LOTR', '.David', 'Slade', 'Howard', 'Shore', 'are', 'great', 'artists', 'great', 'what', 'do', 'personally', 'feel', 'have', 'not', 'understood', 'what', 'Catherine', 'Hardwicke', 'Chris', 'Weitz', 'had', 'done', 'earlier', 'movies', 'Where', 'New', 'Moon', 'picked', 'up', 'mood', 'transitioned', 'well', 'Twilight', 'transition', 'New', 'Moon', 'Eclipse', 'not', 'there.I', 'hope', 'do', ""n't"", 'destroy', 'next', '2', 'movies', 'are', 'making', 'last', 'book']",N/A

There were fewer awkward pauses and it was the least campy of the series.  2) The screenplay follows the book really well.  All of the movies are pretty good on this point, but Eclipse looks like the most comprehensive replication.Now everyone that watched the first two movies or read the books should be pretty familiar with the series by now ... but if you happen to be a parent wondering if you want to let your child see this movie, it is a lot like the last one: shirtless buff boys and a few intense kissing scenes.  The only thing that is different in this movie is that Bella basically begs Edward to have sex with her; of course, he refuses to until they are married.  Everyone's clothes stay on and Edward sweetly explains that he wants to protect their virtue (because it is the only rule he hasn't broken).  This is all in the book, so it just leaves less to the imagination.  I actually thought it was interesting to see this scene in the theater and hear people's reactions.  It could actually have great potential to open up a window of discussion with kids concerning marriage and sex.",5,Best movie of the series - info for conscientious parents,1277942400,"07 1, 2010",2010,1154,"['Why', 'best', 'so', 'far', '1', 'acting', 'better', 'were', 'fewer', 'awkward', 'pauses', 'was', 'least', 'campy', 'series', '2', 'screenplay', 'book', 'really', 'well', 'movies', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'point', 'Eclipse', 'most', 'comprehensive', 'replication.Now', 'everyone', 'watched', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'read', 'books', 'should', 'be', 'pretty', 'familiar', 'series', 'now', 'happen', 'be', 'parent', 'wondering', 'want', 'let', 'child', 'see', 'movie', 'lot', 'last', 'one', 'shirtless', 'buff', 'boys', 'few', 'intense', 'kissing', 'scenes', 'only', 'thing', 'different', 'movie', 'Bella', 'basically', 'Edward', 'have', 'sex', 'course', 'are', 'married', 'Everyone', 'clothes', 'stay', 'Edward', 'sweetly', 'protect', 'virtue', 'only', 'rule', ""n't"", 'broken', 'book', 'just', 'less', 'imagination', 'actually', 'thought', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'scene', 'theater', 'hear', 'people', 'reactions', 'could', 'actually', 'have', 'great', 'potential', 'open', 'up', 'window', 'discussion', 'kids', 'concerning', 'marriage', 'sex']",N/A

1240054,A3I0I917VF3LKG,B001UV4XFG,beatfan,"[316, 360]","Prior to going to the theatre, I sat down to watch the first two installments of the Twilight saga; as a habit, I try to re-watch movies whenever a sequel comes out, just to get an idea of how the series progressed and developed. And in all honesty, both contributed to my overall impression and appreciation of Eclipse.Twilight is a movie I've never really had an opinion on one way or another; it wasn't the greatest movie I've ever seen, but it wasn't a complete train-wreck. Looking back at it now, I have to say that it is very painful to watch. I, personally, found this first installment to be very mediocre and primitive. Everything in it--the corny music, the blue filters, the choppiness, the transition, the plot selection--felt like a crappy teen flick. But the weakest point of this movie was the lead acting, so weak in fact, that it made the story more difficult to watch. The entire time, I could not focus on anything but the fact that Kristen Stewart kept letting her mouth hang open and scoffing/sighing with every line, while a somewhat aggressive Rob Pattinson kept awkwardly twitching and cringing as if he was in pain. There was no buildup to the romance whatsoever, and it left me wondering why Bella and Edward were even a couple. It wasn't until I got the books for Christmas that I read the story and figured out what was supposed to happen.New Moon was a fair improvement, coming from a director whose work I generally like. The music selection was much better and more appropriate, the graphics a bit more exciting and the color-scheme more natural. Can't say that the transitions from every scene were done well; this movie still felt like it could be more uniform. And I absolutely loved the entire sequence in Voltera, Italy; that depiction alone is reason enough not to discount New Moon's cinematography. But though this movie was well-shot and produced, once again, the lead acting lacked. Rob made a change, which unfortunately went in the other direction, making him too robotic and emotionless. In my mind, I started to question whether he even had any talent or was just a poor actor. It wasn't until I saw Remember Me that I thought that he had any potential. And Kristen, who at least limited her scoffing to only two or three times, did not shed a single tear in any of the key scenes. Thankfully, her acting was balanced out by Taylor Lautner's, who actually gave a great portrayal of Jacob.The minute I sat down to watch Eclipse, I had high hopes that David Slade would finally give the Twilight series what it needed - some quality - and walking out at the end of the film, I was anything but disappointed. The flow of the movie was very smooth, and I was actually surprised at how fast it was coming to an end. The special effects and fighting scenes were precisely shot, and the snow-capped mountainside was breathtaking. I am not a Twi-hard, teenager, housewife or part of whatever other stereotype is used to describe people who like this series, but I absolutely loved this movie from beginning to end. In fact, for the first time, I felt like I was watching a re-make of the series with new actors and overall better cinematography.My biggest surprise was the acting. For the first time, Rob actually nailed Edward's personality and depicted him as he was meant to be--sensitive, caring, loving, witty, protective, etc. Every scene he did, whether angry or laid back, was spot-on and believable, all creepiness and awkwardness aside. FINALLY! And Kristen, though still not at her best, actually smiled and laughed and was fun as opposed to depressed and introverted. This improvement from both of them made all the intimate scenes feel more natural and the romance more believable. All the actors, in fact, especially Jackson Rathborne and Nikki Reed, really stepped up to the plate and played their characters well.Although no movie will ever give a faithful adaptation of any book, Eclipse got pretty close. And though there were certain liberties taken with the plot, which I remembered well, they did not detract from the key ideas. Overall, the movie hit on all the aspects of Bella's feelings/decisions about love, family, marriage and human life through different interactions with all the characters. Even if I hadn't read the book, I felt like as a viewer, I had enough information to understand her struggle and ultimate choice.I know that there is always a negative for every positive, so there are plenty of haters of this film. But despite the complaints about the substance/content of the story (which should be attributed to the novelist, not the director), I feel it's unfair to deny that this is more mature, professionally made film that actually breathed some life into what could have otherwise been a cheesy, teen flick.",4,Loved Every Minute of a Film They Finally Got Right (And Can't Understand All the

I absolutely adore the first two-I felt the directors really got the feel of the books. I CANNOT understand how anyone could prefer this movie to the others-unless they are not coming from a book perspective.This one...not so much.First, the soundtrack was awful. New Moon had a beautiful and moody score and some songs that I wanted to listen to after the movie. The songs in this one were distracting and there was nothing pretty or atmospheric about the score (which really surprised me; I love Howard Shore's Lord of the Rings score).Second, this director had Jacob as an angry character, and didn't show any other side to him. Bella was to wishy washy not really nice to either Jacob or Edward, and  Edward looked like he was begging after an uninterested person the whole time, though Edward had some great moments (particularly the tent scene, and his fight with Riley and Victoria).Third, certain characters changed to much. I didn't like the recasting of Victoria, they shouldn't be changing actors 3 movies in. Jasper suddenly developed some strange accent 3 movies in as well.Lastly and worst of all, the tacked on ending was horrific. Bella explaining to the theaters with a phony speech about fitting in with the Vampires world and it was never a choice between Edward and Jacob. Huh? Did this director even see New Moon? It just seemed like a way for the filmmakers to try and make Bella look like a strong female character, which she isn't (and that's ok).There were some good things, like I mentioned the fight with Edward/Victoria/Riley/Seth. The cgi wolves were really cute and expressive. I also thought Riley was excellent, great casting and acting there.

I like many others dismissed this series as being juvenile, without investigating it myself...until I was stuck in O'Hare for 4 hours and had read every magazine available!  Because this Saga starts out in high school doesn't make it young adult...I believe this seris is adult.  Stephenies publisher simplified the first three books because THEY saw this as young adult.  That was her initial book deal, three books. Breaking Dawn is the 4th and marvelously different. Eclipse and Breaking Dawn are my favorite books, though Twilight is a close 2nd to these two because they introduced these wonderful characters. This film captured the book as much as was humanly possibly in the time they had... I believe all three films would have benefitted from an additiona 10-20 minutes each (especially New Moon - which destroyed Bella and Edwards reunification in dialogue, action & sequence of events).  Eclipse had David Slade - who would have thought it would have taken him to finally complete the picture for this series!!?!  David did it! - Secondly, he knew the talent he had before him... Kristen, Rob, Ashley, Billy, Taylor.. this guy knew what he had and he knew how to direct his talent!  These young people are oh so talented and perfectly cast, but you have to be able to direct young people to get the most out of them - that's what Catherine knew (and Chris forgot!).  Twilight Saga is not just a story line and script on auto pilot and you need to work to translate what we (the fans!) Love!  David Slade did that - Rob did his best work to date - when Bella says ""yes"" to marriage - in the book it says (paraphrased) he looked as glorious as an archangel - and Rob pulls that off - as I believe no one else ever could.  Rob is Edward personified, but he cannot do this alone - it takes direction, proper editing & decent dialogue...ECLIPSE is excellent!!! Many who have pooh-pooh'd these movies dig ECLIPSE - because this movie, as in the books, the adult portion of the series really takes over... I wish David Slade was directing Breaking Dawn - Let's hope this new director can garner the same measure of action/edge/emotion and atmosphere that is the Twilight Saga & can direct these actors in the manor they deserve and require - ECLIPSE ACHIEVED THAT!",5,Edward is an Archangel!

And if you have bothered to read the books or see the films, you have already decided whether or not you love or loathe the franchise. Eclipse is the latest in the film series...If it is the last thing she ever does, Victoria (Bryce Dallas Howard) is going to make Bella (Kristen Stewart) pay for the death of her mate. The spirited, fiery-haired vampire is no match for the local band of werewolves and vampires who protect Bella, so she takes matters into her own hands and recruits Riley (Xavier Samuel) to assist her in raising an army. In the meantime, unaware of the danger, Bella is caught between her immortal potential lovers -- the physically cold but romantic vampire, Edward (Robert Pattinson) and the warm-blooded, spirited shape-shifting werewolf, Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner). While she is devoted to Edward, the rift that it has caused with Jacob leaves a hole in her life, an emotional gulf at the fact that the two young men cannot come to terms. Torn between her intention to leave everything she knows behind and become an immortal, but knowing that will separate her from Jacob forever, Bella faces a new series of choices and situations when it becomes apparent that her life is in peril.Considered one of the most popular franchises of our time, Eclipse is the best film in the Twilight series. With a new director comes a much larger scale outlook on the production, with picturesque settings and breathtaking views. There are a few more battle scenes this time around and subtle attempts at humor. The acting still suffers from occasional stiffness, but many of the sequences have an additional charm and it's nice to see some of the back stories and histories of individual characters. Here, we visit Rosalie, Jasper, and the first shape-shifter's past, as well as encounter more of the Italian vampires that made such an impression in the second film. Bryce is a worthy replacement for the previous Victoria and lends a bit of sass to the film, which still relies heavily on the romantic triangle but does branch out into some good arguments for why Bella should be cautious in her decision. No doubt these will not sway devoted fans from one opinion to the other, but for a undecided like me it tended to send me in a shall we say, wolfier direction.The flashbacks are done well, and the musical score is great. The only real complaint in terms of filmmaking that I have is early action scenes are so rapidly shot and cut that it is difficult to tell what is happening. There's also an extraordinary amount of close-ups. For long time fans it is solid improvement on the success of the previous two films. I was sorry not to have seen more of the Cullens as individuals, but their limited screen time did provide some further insight into their characters, and the audience is introduced to some of the names and faces that become important in later incidents. While I might take issue with some of the underlining messages (more prominent in literature than on film), I do have to applaud this series for its stance on abstinence and its decision to respect the ""outdated"" notion of marriage. At one point, Edward says the divorce rate between vampires is far less than humans. It's a life-long commitment (or in this case, eternity) that is taken with the utmost seriousness.",4,My Favorite of the Franchise,1332892800,"03 28, 2012",2012,3391,"['are', 'thirteen', 'ninety-five', 'doubt', 'have', 'heard', 'Twilight', 'have', 'bothered', 'read', 'books', 'see', 'films', 'have', 'already', 'decided', 'not', 'love', 'loathe', 'franchise', 'Eclipse', 'latest', 'film', 'series', 'last', 'thing', 'ever', 'Victoria', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'going', 'make', 'Bella', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'pay', 'death', 'mate', 'spirited', 'fiery-haired', 'vampire', 'match', 'local', 'band', 'werewolves', 'vampires', 'who', 'protect', 'Bella', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'recruits', 'Riley', 'Xavier', 'Samuel', 'assist', 'raising', 'army', 'meantime', 'unaware', 'danger', 'Bella', 'caught', 'immortal', 'potential', 'lovers', 'physically', 'cold', 'romantic', 'vampire', 'Edward', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', 'warm-blooded', 'spirited', 'shape-shifting', 'werewolf', 'Jacob', 'Black', 'Taylor', 'Lautner', 'devoted', 'Edward', 'rift', 'caused', 'Jacob', 'hole', 'life', 'emotional', 'gulf', 'fact', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'can', 'not', 'come', 'terms', 'Torn', 'intention', 'leave', 'everything', 'behind', 'become', 'immortal', 'knowing', 'will', 'separate', 'Jacob', 'forever', 'Bella', 'new', 'series', 'choices', 'situations', 'when', 'apparent', 'life', 'peril.Considered', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'franchises', 'time', 'Eclipse', 'best', 'film', 'Twilight', 'series', 'new', 'director', 'much', 'larger', 'scale', 'outlook', 'production', 'picturesque', 'settings', 'breathtaking', 'views', 'are', 'few', 'more', 'battle', 'time', 'subtle', 'attempts', 'humor', 'acting', 'still', 'occasional', 'stiffness', 'many', 'sequences', 'have', 'additional', 'charm', 'nice', 'see', 'back', 'stories', 'histories', 'individual', 'characters', 'Here', 'visit', 'Rosalie', 'Jasper', 'first', 'shape-shifter', 'past', 'as', 'well', 'encounter', 'more', 'Italian', 'vampires', 'made', 'impression', 'second', 'film', 'Bryce', 'worthy', 'replacement', 'previous', 'Victoria', 'bit', 'sass', 'film', 'still', 'heavily', 'romantic', 'triangle', 'branch', 'out', 'good', 'arguments', 'why', 'Bella', 'should', 'be', 'cautious', 'decision', 'doubt', 'will', 'not', 'sway', 'devoted', 'fans', 'one', 'opinion', 'other', 'undecided', 'tended', 'send', 'shall', 'say', 'wolfier', 'direction.The', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'done', 'well', 'musical', 'score', 'great', 'only', 'real', 'complaint', 'terms', 'filmmaking', 'have', 'early', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'so', 'rapidly', 'shot', 'cut', 'difficult', 'tell', 'what', 'happening', 'also', 'extraordinary', 'amount', 'close-ups', 'long', 'time', 'fans', 'solid', 'improvement', 'success', 'previous', 'two', 'films', 'was', 'sorry', 'not', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'Cullens', 'individuals', 'limited', 'screen', 'time', 'did', 'provide', 'further', 'insight', 'characters', 'audience', 'introduced', 'names', 'become', 'important', 'later', 'incidents', 'might', 'take', 'issue', 'underlining', 'messages', 'more', 'prominent', 'literature', 'film', 'do', 'have', 'applaud', 'series', 'stance', 'abstinence', 'decision', 'respect', 'outdated', 'notion', 'marriage', 'one', 'point', 'Edward', 'divorce', 'rate', 'vampires', 'far', 'less', 'humans', 'life-long', 'commitment', 'case', 'eternity', 'taken', 'utmost', 'seriousness']",N/A

We put the movie in to watch and within 5 minutes I was bored.  The scenes are short and seem to be cobbled together--there is no flow.  It seems stilted.  I kept having to explain things to my husband because they chose little snippets of dialogue from the book, but put them in inappropriate places with no foundation.  It just seems that if one hadn't read the book, the movie would make little sense.  I'll watch it again because I do enjoy the characters, but with the material available in the book, this movie could have been so much  better.I am hoping Breaking Dawn is better",3,Not What I Wanted to See,1291420800,"12 4, 2010",2010,840,"['want', 'preface', 'review', 'saying', 'love', 'Twilight', 'series', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'movies', 'fact', 'could', 'see', 'problems', 'more', 'Twilight', 'New', 'Moon', 'waited', 'anxiously', 'DVD', 'be', 'released', 'Twilight', 'fan', 'put', 'movie', 'watch', '5', 'minutes', 'was', 'bored', 'scenes', 'are', 'short', 'seem', 'be', 'cobbled', 'together', 'flow', 'stilted', 'kept', 'having', 'explain', 'things', 'husband', 'chose', 'little', 'snippets', 'dialogue', 'book', 'put', 'inappropriate', 'places', 'foundation', 'just', 'one', 'had', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'movie', 'would', 'make', 'little', 'sense', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'again', 'do', 'enjoy', 'characters', 'material', 'available', 'book', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better.I', 'am', 'hoping', 'Breaking', 'Dawn', 'better']",N/A
1240085,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001UV4XFG,Chris Pandolfi,"[7, 14]","""The Twilight Saga: New Moon"" abruptly ended with Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) telling his girlfriend, Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) that he will turn her into a vampire on the condition that they get married first. And so ""The Twilight Saga: Eclipse,"" the third film in a series serving as an extended metaphor for abstinence, begins with the two lovingly lying in a field of flowers, and you can sense the anticipation they both feel, especially Bella, who radiates with virginal longing. As bothersome as I found this twice before, this time around I found it oddly amusing, maybe because, after their painfully statuesque performances in ""New Moon,"" Stewart and Pattinson are once again allowed to emote. Stewart especially, who takes on a whole different energy when she's given the opportunity to crack a smile.Alas, it's quickly hampered by a scene in which the metaphor turns literal; Bella wants to have sex with Edward while she's still human, but his chivalrous standards kick into high gear and he refuses her advances. He then lectures her on how, back in his day, he would have courted her, taken chaperoned walks with her, asked her father's permission for her hand in marriage, and so on and so forth. He then tells her that, while his soul is done for, hers is still worth preserving. What I find intriguing is that Stephenie Meyer wove such blatant themes into a fantasy, a genre created specifically as a way to escape reality. Even if sex before marriage is forbidden by Mormon doctrine, what's to stop her from writing about it? If I were her, I would have had Bella and Edward go at it like dogs in heat, all the while remembering that my personal values haven't been affected.Complicating Bella's situation is the hot-blooded, mostly shirtless werewolf Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner), who professes his love for her as well as his hatred of Edward, the Cullen Clan, and vampires in general. Does Bella feel the same way about Jacob? She's not entirely sure. All she knows is that she needs both him and Edward to protect her, which means they will have to find some way to get along. It seems that, up in nearby Seattle, the evil vampire Victoria (Bryce Dallas Howard) has been busy recruiting an army of young vampires, or newbies, for purposes of attacking the Cullen Clan and getting revenge against Bella; aware of this, the Cullens join forces with their blood enemies, the werewolves, in the hopes of putting a stop to the newbies, who are apparently much more lethal than their older counterparts.Despite the preachy subtexts, ""Eclipse"" is an improvement - albeit a tepid one - from the previous two ""Twilight"" films. I appreciated the greater emotional range displayed by Stewart and Pattinson, I liked looking at the none-too-convincing visual effects, and I found the action sequences more exciting, sparse though they may be. All the same, it still suffers from excessive length and unreasonable pacing, and just like before, they're linked to tedious conversations between the leads. I was especially fed up with Edward's repeated attempts to talk Bella out of becoming a vampire, and likewise, with her insistence on going through with it. The more I hear the Cullens describe the required sacrifices, the less I'm inclined to side with Bella; aging and death are frightening, but soulless immortality is unthinkable.Lautner is still a chiseled hunk for the girls to swoon over, which may adequately distract them from the fact that he spends virtually all of his performance angrily clenching his jaw. When Jacob isn't romantically sulking, then he's furiously confronting Edward. Nowhere is this more apparent than in a tent high atop a snowy mountain, in which Bella, her teeth chattering from the cold, lets Jacob embrace her for his body heat: ""Let's face it,"" he tells Edward, ""I am hotter than you."" As Bella sleeps, Jacob and Edward glower at each other, and they quietly but firmly discuss the fact that Bella still has to make a choice, and that, if she had been given enough time, she already could have made it. So I guess the question is simple, especially if you've been eating at Burger King: Is Bella on Team Jacob or Team Edward?""The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"" will almost certainly please the fans, just as they were pleased twice before. Non fans will have a rougher time of it, although I suspect it will be easier to win them over with this film than it was with the first two. As for myself, I recognize its progress as the third chapter of a series, but it's still too slow, too overwrought, and too didactic for me to recommend it. You've got to hand it to Stephenie Meyer - she really knows how to sermonize. I might have gotten something out of it had the topic been less divisive, however. Aren't there moral themes that we all more or less agree upon, such as treating everyone with respect or being charitable or something along those lines? If I'm going to be preached at, and if it has to be in the form of a vampire romance, at least make sure that the message is making good sense.",3,Is Bella on Team Jacob or Team Edward?,1277856000,"06

Because that's what happened with Twilight.  We ended up with over two hours of Kristen Stewart stuttering her way through a love story with a vampire.  New Moon, wasn't much different, except she was stuttering with werewolves.  So, I could only imagine what they would do with Jasper's backstory (which was one of my favorite parts of the book), the big fight sequence at the end, and the near sex Bella and Edward have.Thankfully, David Slade (whose movies I have never seen, because I have a strong aversion to bones being broken) came through, and made this movie shine like the saga should've been handled from the beginning.  There was humor, great action, passion, jealousy, and believable vampires.  For the first time, Jackson Rathbone shined as Jasper, because he wasn't hidden in the shadows like they had him in the first two movies.  Kristen Stewart, seemed believable (even with the crappiest wig on Earth) when she kissed Jacob.  I still have issues with her ability to kiss her supposed real-life boyfriend who plays her immortal beloved in the movies.  I think the thing that grabbed my attention was the lack of chasteness.  In the first two books, Edward and Bella have strong lusty feelings.  But for some reason, they were more suppressed in the film.

This A-story or B-story is suggested to provide a certain cohesive tension until graduation night when this event is supposed to commence, but does not.  The school (junior high?) it seems is divided between cliques of vampires and werewolves, excepting the class valedictorian and the faculty, losers who retain their humanity, even in Hollywood. One sits around the school cafeteria with one's respective intimates, vamp or wolf, rapping, and staring down at the crummy institutional fare on the plate, inwardly craving a gut full of good ol' flesh and blood.  Not an unrealistic portrait of school life when honestly considered.  Shakespeare would seriously envy the amount of dialogue packed into this script which deluges the audience in backstory, mercilessly playing on the deepest hopes, fears, and dilemmas of folks between the ages of eight to maybe fifteen, until they either swim or drown. But none can doubt the commercial success of Twilight. The makers have targeted their audience (the bulk of the current theatre-going audience alluded to above) with enviable expertise. Surprisingly, action scenes account for no more than 15% of the footage, rather incredible as they are at that.  The credit here must go to the actors. Ms Stewart is blessed with an expressive, almost Keatonesque melancholy in her eyes and brow which will only mellow with age, an A-list fundament, and she plays admirably to the camera.  As everyone in the world who watches movies knows at this point, Pattinson and K-Stew are beautiful people - which prompts one to reflect on how much more fun, though less of a shameless cash cow, such a film would have been, had at least some, if not all, of their romance had been shot au natural.  But then again, we are, if not happily, brought to remembrance of that special time in life when the passion of love ran higher than even our all too human, inexorable animal lust.

Yes, albeit slightly. Some of the supporting vampires actually get lines, two of which actually get backstories and characterization (something that these movies don't like to elaborate on). Though the woman who plays the vampire wife (I honestly don't remember her name, they never say it in this one) I pity because she literally has no lines in the entire movie until the end when they're defending the pointless new-born vampire. Even the werewolf flashback was better than the main story. The story should've been about the people with interesting histories, not some stupid idiot who wants to sell her soul just to become a blood-thirsty killer. Where's the logic. Oops, forgot, there is no logic here. Yet Bella is the worst female character ever written. She thinks her life is tortured yet she has two guys chasing after her! Then, being the jerk she is, plays on their emotions. Like after she kisses the werewolf and finds out Edward is standing right behind her. And the fact that she was stupid enough to not to wear a coat in the mountains (she really just wanted the Perpetually Shirtless Werewolf to get in the sack with her. I don't buy that ""constant hot temperature"" thing)! Though the funny part was she breaks her hand after punching him! I'd watch that scene in a loop if could and still find it funny! And of course let's not forget (though I can understand why you would seeing as how she has TWO SCENES in the whole movie) our Gratuitous Celebrity Cameo; Dakota Fanning! Why she gets so much acclaim I'll never know. Her character is pointless to the plot and I know what she makes people see when she tortures them (it's the first two movies). Action finally occurs though there's only two bits; first is a chase sequence that goes no where except to reintroduce the minor annoyance that is Victoria (who they could've done the story without) and finally the big fight between the good guys and the bad guys. And I must ask if there's any real reason why the vampires break like glass or if we're supposed to accept that it comes with their glitter skin? It's a decent fight but I don't get why the good vampires were so concerened about the new-borns, I'm pretty sure they could've beaten them without the werewolves. Howard Shore picks up the music department in this, which probably makes it feel more legitimate to me, but knowing that he's degrading himself after doing Lord of the Rings is disappointing (but a paycheck's a paycheck). All in all, it was a decent movie and I'm glad to see that they are improving but for a non-fan like myself who's just now saying that the third movie is the good one is pretty bad considering most movies with a part three are generally considered the worst and never live up to the first two.

There is a good balance between the tension between the characters (particularly the triangle - Bella, Edward and Jacob) and action.  I read an interview with Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner where they talk about the differences between New Moon and Eclipse.  The overall feeling of both actors was of Eclipse presenting more emotional of the development of the characters.  The rivalry between Edward and Jacob is palpable and Kristen Stewart plays off the emotions very well.  Clearly, she is committed to Edward but she has to deal with her feelings for Jacob. Overall, the comfort level of the actors in their roles is better.  Taylor Lautner, in particular, filled out Jacob's character very well. One could feel Jacob's frustration.I liked the presentation of the sub-plot stories of Rosalie (Nikki Reed) and Jasper (Jackson Rathbone).  Rosalie's brooding over Bella's choice to become a vampire is explained in a well-acted scene and Jasper's character develops showing his strength of character.  I would have liked a bit more of Rosalie's story on her transformation into a vampire but I also understand the need to keep the film within a reasonable timeframe.  The battle scene between the newborn vampire army and the Cullens and werewolves was nicely orchestrated with just enough emphasis of the individual fight scenes. The concluding scene between Edward and Bella about their marriage and her transformation gets us ready for the final installment.  How will Bella deal with her parents after she becomes a vampire?

1240112,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B001UV4XFG,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[5, 10]","In ""Eclipse"", part three of the Twilight Saga (Twilight (Two-Disc Special Edition)andThe Twilight Saga: New Moon (Two-Disc Special Edition)), director David Slade zeroes in on the ""should she or shouldn't she?"" question that has proved to be the pulsing lifeblood behind the popular teen quartet of novels by author Stephanie Meyer. However, as millions of fans already know--she does--and sadly, that takes a big bite out of the whole Team Edward versus Team Jacob rivalry, rendering the whole premise rather toothless.In the last two films, none of that mattered, so why should it matter in this the third and in my opinion the most likable of the trilogy so far?  Fans desire only to see their beloved characters brought to life on the screen.  ""Eclipse"" does just that.  Any criticisms regarding the senselessness of the storyline or the futile confusion of a girl that has already made her decision two books ago should be taken up with Meyer, not the director or screenwriter of any of the films.The creation of an entertaining and faithful adaptation that enables teenage girls to swoon, scream and choose sides at the sight of the film's two hunky albeit warring leads, become better acquainted with the good vampire clan of ""vegetarian"" bloodsuckers, understand some of the characters' personal histories, delve into the native Indian lore of the Quileute tribe while presenting the typical boy-girl-boy triangle with a supernatural twist, requires some storytelling skills especially in a two-hour time frame that includes the additional nemesis of a marauding newbie vampire army as the ultimate plot driver.  Slade handles all this well, managing his youthful cast with a tastefully chaste sympathy that adds a little heat, but not enough to get accompanying parents enraged by what could have been another of the usual messages of no-holes-barred excess that Hollywood delivers without a thought to delicate and burgeoning psyches.True to Meyer's pro-abstinence sensibilities, Slade plays off the `fire and ice' motif (presented as a metaphor by Bella's introductory recital of Robert Frost's poem of the same name for the opposing natures of her two leading young men) juxtaposing Bella (wholesomely perfect Kristen Stewart) between the forever absolutes of male over-protectiveness--the icy courteous albeit bloodsucking Edward (the weed-whacker haired Rob Pattinson) and the fiery angry self-possessed Jacob (the deliciously shirtless Taylor Lautner).  The audience can feel Bella's development from an uncomfortably undefined young woman to someone with the potential capability to face her own wakening desires without self-delusion or compromise.  In this sense, ""Eclipse"" depicts teenage decisions with an age appropriate amount of confusion and wonder that seems generally gauged for this tale of Bella and the Beasts.In addition to just the right amount of sensitivity with regard to the normally arising questions about just how far an actual teenage relationship should go, ""Eclipse"" tackles the larger question of choosing one's own destiny--does Bella want a human life with Jacob or supernatural eternity with Edward?  Does her natural awkwardness transcend into a sense that the mainstream obviously just isn't in the cards for her? Bella is given the opportunity to explore this breaking aspect of self awareness in different scenes with different players:  father, mother, fellow graduates, the wolf clan that wants her to stay human and the vampire fusion that understands her desire to fuse.  Whether or not any of this actually works or not isn't the fault of Slade or screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg.  Again, any problems with the sometimes dimensionless dialogue between the players--especially the lines meant to convey jealousy and competition between wolf and undead--can be blamed on the circuitous adolescent whining conveyed in the original text by Stephanie Meyer.The paradox for Slade or any other director chosen to do the next book in the series then becomes, ""Should he?"" or ""Shouldn't he?"" with regard to plumping up the thin material with some background flashback that will make the characters and their current level of desire for life, for love, for family and friends more understandable.  He ""should"" but does he want to be attacked by legions of fundamentalist fans for interjecting impurity to their beloved books?Kristen Stewart and Rob Pattinson work the material to the best of their abilities this time; their respective characters flow together with slightly more familiarity.  However the melancholy tone still prevails--with all that danger aloft, how could it not?  The basic chemical bonding between the two still seems to need a formula adjustment. Imagine Bella kissing and wanting to get close to a guy whose temperature stays in a steady arctic zone fit for a damp seal or frosty polar bear.  That might work in the tropics, but in the wet Northwest? In the same respect, I don't understand why a 21st century girl with Bella's experience or sensibilities would want someone tracking her as if she were Big Foot each and every time she decided to go for a ride in her truck. Meyer presents Edward as a prim and proper Edwardian, but no background story on his pre-vampire life shows us his soul.  We are told that Bella and Edward love each other with a Romeo and Juliet whimsy--do we feel it?  Where's the dramatic lover's theme music to pull at the senses whenever their two faces fill the screen?  Non-existent--its the old ""I'm being told"" not ""shown"" no-no.In that sense, don't see ""Eclipse"" unless you are well versed by either the novels (The Twilight Saga Collection) or the first two film installments.  Slade doesn't bother to recap either of the two initial pinings for the vampire or the werewolf/girl-woman relationships.  Instead he and the rest of the Twilight Saga franchise assume that the audience, a motley crew of pre-teenage/teenage girls and their twi-mothers have sat through the pre-midnight showings of Twilight and New Moon for the umpteenth time and now revved and ready for this latest adventure have taken sides as illustrated by the wearing of Team Edward or Team Jacob t-shirts.  As a stand-alone, ""Eclipse"" would have a hard time explaining the motives for the action portion of the film--just why is the red-headed vamp(ire) Victoria seeking out Bella to feed her revenge?  A little review would have served those not in the know well.On the other hand Team Slade excels in fleshing out the vampire awakenings of the lovely but malignant Rosalie (Nikki Reed) and the Alice-smitten Jasper (Jackson Rathbone) in a far better way then Meyer does in her book--Meyer never covers that extra ground for Carlisle (Peter Facinelli), Esme (Elizabeth Reaser), Alice (Ashley Greene), Emmett (Kellan Lutz) or for that matter, even Edward himself.  Instead we are treated to glossy two-dimensional portraits of supernatural creatures we can only hope to understand via their similarity to vacuous supermodels--not based on their inner, very human, cravings.The teen scheme cover-ups, so much a part of the novels (Bella constantly lies to both of her parents), thankfully is absent here.  A child of divorce, Bella contends with negative feelings regarding marriage but is reassured that commitment does bite and can grow legs by the family of vampires and their forever mates and the wolves and their ability to imprint.  So many lessons to be learned--and all within two hours or four huge books, depending on which medium best suits!Technically, the computer-generated wolf colossuses look and seem real enough to want to snuggle against. Who wouldn't want one of those impressive mega-pets watching the old homestead?  Parents need not be disturbed by any notion of excess gore; the action sequences of fast-moving cart-wheeling vampire martial arts works without any shredding of flesh with the usual blood fest associated with a battle involving just one hemoglobin slurper.Bottom line?  ""Eclipse,"" the latest installment of the Twilight Saga delivers what its fans have come to expect--a faithful adaptation of the teen angst-driven triangle tale of Edward, Bella and Jacob.  Even though, the audience knows from the start that the contest really has no substance, the Team Jacob camp remains strong, vigilantly wolf-snarling at Bella's decision to explore the subzero rather than warm her hands via wolf pelt.  One hopes that dawn will never break, sadly we already know ahead of time that it does.  Director Slade treats us to vampire birth flashbacks and teenage ponderings of the big questions regarding love, lust and eternity without being offensive or caving into the typical teen marketed extravaganzas promoting growing up too fast amidst the excess.  Some dialogue weakness does not help the characters become more than 2.5 dimensional.  However, the action sequences and CG images of both the glittering globin gulpers and their hirsute nemesises facilitate the fantasy in this fairytale adventure.  This monster mash of newbie vampires, protective wolves, angling Volturi and the triangle of the Sleeping Beauty prototype meeting and greeting head on her greatest male fears is recommended for the fan and rated accordingly.Diana Faillace Von Behren""reneofc""",4,Monster Mash,1277856000,"06 30, 2010",2010,9264,"['Eclipse', 'part', 'three', 'Twilight', 'Saga', 'Twilight', 'Two-Disc', 'Special',

1240126,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B001UV4XFG,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[8, 11]","Love Lesson From Twilight #4,267: ""Love"" turns all guys into controlling jerks who don't do anything except compete to see whose dingdong is bigger.Sadly that's most of what's going on in ""Twilight: Eclipse."" It's the best of the series thus far, mainly because some underdeveloped characters get some backstory and there are some interesting action scenes... but the movie is smothered in a thick coating of phlegmlike teen angst, whining and bickering. It gets to the point where you WISH the bad guys would arrive.In summary: Edward (Robert Pattinson) is pestering Bella (Kristen Stewart) to marry him. Bella doesn't want to because (boohoo) her parents are divorced and marriage is dead to her, but she DOES want to become a vampire. Jacob (Taylor Lautner) wants Bella to dump Edward and be with him instead.Meanwhile, the evil Victoria is raising an army of newborn vampires to come to Forks and kill Bella. Yes, seriously -- she raised an entire army to kill ONE bland human teenager. Not the Cullens, or the people of Forks. Just Bella. And since the entire universe revolves around Bella, both the werewolves and the Cullens are desperate to protect her. So they overcome centuries of mutual hatred and join forces to protect her.I will admit it: ""Twilight Eclipse"" is easily the best movie in this series... which is like saying that a pinch is less unpleasant than a poke in the eye. Amazingly, there are actually some taut, fast-paced scenes here, as well as some creepy eerie scenes involving the newborn army (like their  too-briefly glimpsed mayhem in Seattle).Too bad that isn't what the plot is REALLY about. Instead, we're battered with a bad teen soap opera -- lots of heavy breathing, kissing, whining, and romantic estrangements that last about two minutes. The dialogue is painfully vapid (""You love him."" ""I love you more."" ""I know""), and the director seems to be desperately trying to come up with some kind of plot other than Edward and Jacob being emo jerks.Kristen Stewart gives her usual one-note performance -- dead eyes, masklike face and a monotone voice. And the insipid Bella just drifts through the movie, more of a living MacGuffin than a heroine. It's hard to see why not one but TWO boys would be ready to die for a boring girl who just sits there breathing through her large front teeth.Robert Pattinson is pretty obviously just here for for his paycheck, while Taylor Lautner gives it his best effort.

I knew it was probably designed for girl tweens but tried it anyway (at home).I had never read the books so the movie held some surprises.  Vampires, ok.  (Well cast by the way.)  Before we know too much Edward saves Bella's life (I don't understand why this actress, decent in other movies, is so bland and why Edward AND Jacob fall for her).  Cool scene.  But the scene that was most fun was the baseball game.  It was well done and fun to watch ""vampire"" baseball.The movie does tend to get bogged down (for me) when Bella thinks too much or when Bella/Edward talk too much (maybe tween girls find the talk romantic), I don't know.  Finally, there is some violent action near the end which helps.I  do have more trouble with Jakob and the wolves.  Vampires ok, but now super large wolves, too.  I can't stand when Jakob pouts, storms off, or looks smug (say, when Bella gets on his motorcycle).  And his taking his shirt off all the time is quite annoying (I know some kids like this when I grew up.As a guy, if you want to throw some sex in fine --- a little making out with actual T&A; would be fine.  I could take Jakob having his shirt off during such a scene.  Of course, having a beautiful girl /woman play the part of Bella would have helped, too.  It would also make Edward's and Jakob's lust for Bella at leastsomewhat believable.(The third movie is strong on action --- a good thing; but the second movie is boring and has too much talk between Bella and Jakob.

1240157,A328S9RN3U5M68,B001UV4XFG,Grady Harp,"[3, 4]","There are legions of ardent fans of this Twilight Saga - this third installment is ECLIPSE - and they obviously have their reasons for loving both the books and the movies.  That's good news, especially for Stephenie Meyer who is probably only second to JK Rowling (Harry Potter series) in skyrocketing income from the transformation of book to screen adventure.  The scenery in Vancouver,BC is pretty and the music and lyrics  for the film by Howard Shore is meant to add to the story line.The script by Melissa Rosenberg (who has done some fine work on the television series 'Dexter') is written in staccato phrases - one-liners that don't really allow the actors to express much real emotion under such confines.  For this viewer this is one of the main reasons the film doesn't fly.  Even if one can buy into the fairytale atmosphere of flatline normal human girl Bella (Kristen Stewart) falling for rather stiff and distant and oh so proper vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson, who has proven in his other films 'Remember Me' and 'Little Ashes' that he actually CAN act) while at the same time falling in love with werewolf Jacob (Taylor Lautner, ever more buff and using his physique to great advantage in almost every scene), there are problems with the story for the casual viewer  who hasn't read the Twilight Saga or followed the previous films.  Despite the film's building to the altercation and confrontation between Seattle vampires versus the small town Cullen vampires now supported by the town's werewolves courtesy of Jacob et al the story feels static. No emotion: script versus acting - it is a toss up.  Once again Billy Burke and Anna Kendrick (so fine in 'Up in the Air') add to the quality.  The werewolves are huge and cuddly, and the blue meadow flowers serving as background for Edward and Bella that open and close the film are nice.And we have two more episodes to go - or more... Definitely an acquired taste.

To be honest, I watched this (and read the first three books) out of a sense of pop culture obligation--I do need to stay abreast of the popular trends in YA literature and culture. Sometimes that obligation is enjoyable and rewarding (e.g., the Harry Potter novels and films), and sometimes that obligation is an excruciating act of penance (e.g., any and all things Twilight). What can I say to express the profound artistic void that this film represents? That the acting is wooden and hammy? That the story is about as interesting as watching bread mold?

1240176,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B001UV4XFG,Jason,"[4, 8]","I admit that I'm not the target audience for the Twilight series.  I do, however, review all movies, good or bad, and that (along with the desires of my better half) warranted a trip to the theatre.So I ventured out amongst the sparkling pink hues, reverberating a perpetual gum-smacking staccato, and felt every bit as claustrophobic as Black Friday.  After purchasing tickets I peered out the theatre and couldn't help but notice the glazed-over stares of the tween throngs moving sloth-like towards the door in a pubescent phalanx and ponder the similarity to a Romero film.  Swann of the Dead?The Twilight series left off with Bella Swann (Kristen Stewart) stuck in a strained love triangle between mortal enemies:  vampire Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) and werewolf Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner).  If there are pangs of anguish or throes of passion, they're masked by what I can only assume is a bout of Botox left on the cutting room floor of New Moon, because Bella shows nearly no emotion whatsoever.  At certain points of the film the battle for Ella's heart really started to resemble scenes from Weekend at Bernie's.  Nonetheless, Team Edward and Team Jacob must put aside their differences to collectively protect Bella from a growing coven of sadistic newborn vampires - an army spawned by bloodthirsty vampire Victoria (Bryce Dallas Howard) to avenge the loss of her lover - conspicuously ravaging the Seattle landscape.Meanwhile, Bella's vicissitudes about love and immortality grow tiresome, revealing major acting flaws and bad script writing.  The dialogue between pale-faced lovers - not for racial or vampire reasons, but because she's lifeless - may as well have been a vampire transformation conversation of ""Uh-huh,"" followed by ""Nu-uh.""  When Rosalie mentions that being ""frozen means never moving forward,"" it immediately clears up why Bella, who appears to have Bell's palsy (Bella's palsy?), is so readily accepted into the cold, undead clan.  As for the beleaguered choice between lovers, Edward, the pedophile stalker, and tritagonist Jacob, who leers at Bella like a rapist while making necrophilia-related comments about ""loving Bella after she's dead,"" is a situation that only gets muddier with each film.The film's primary positive is that the script finally surfaces above the 20+ minutes of staring contests in the previous two Twilight movies.  In fact, learning that the rebirth of Jasper (Jackson Rathbone) occurred while he served as a Cavalry officer in the Civil War, and discovering Rosalie's (Nikki Reed) unfortunate transformation went a long way towards the character development and understanding of their roles.  Even better, however, is the Quileute folklore told with great reverence by Billy Black (Gil Birmingham).  I enjoyed that part very much.  Somewhere along the line, however, there is a subplot-anchor about the Volturi, which is evidently an ancient vampire word meaning ""rigid acting superfluous to the script,"" that adds nearly nothing and could have been removed without any coherency issues.  Direction was also notably improved over its prequels.  It should come as no surprise that the tension is better relayed and the minimal action comes in vicious rushes since David Slade directedHard Candyand30 Days of Nightbefore tackling the Twilight series.Twilight addicts will want to fornicate with this sequel as background noise.  Average movies fans, many of whom probably hated the original and thought the second was an improvement, will still find Kristen Stewart's atrocious acting almost intolerable.  I must say, however, that the series is improving.  With any luck there will be less sparkling and fewer staring contests as the series progresses, and more details about the various characters who act as the crutch for Stewart and the weak script.",3,"The series is improving, but the script and Kristen Stewart are still prohibitive",1278374400,"07 6, 2010",2010,3822,"['admit', ""'m"", 'not', 'target', 'audience', 'Twilight', 'series', 'do', 'however', 'review', 'movies', 'good', 'bad', 'desires', 'better', 'half', 'warranted', 'trip', 'theatre.So', 'ventured', 'out', 'sparkling', 'pink', 'hues', 'reverberating', 'perpetual', 'gum-smacking', 'staccato', 'felt', 'bit', 'as', 'claustrophobic', 'Black', 'Friday', 'purchasing', 'tickets', 'peered', 'out', 'theatre', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'notice', 'glazed-over', 'stares', 'tween', 'throngs', 'moving', 'sloth-like', 'towards', 'door', 'pubescent', 'phalanx', 'ponder', 'similarity', 'Romero', 'film', 'Swann', 'Dead', 'Twilight', 'series', 'left', 'off', 'Bella', 'Swann', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'stuck', 'strained', 'love', 'triangle', 'mortal', 'enemies', 'vampire', 'Edward', 'Cullen', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', 'Jacob', 'Black', 'Taylor', 'Lautner', 'are', 'pangs', 'anguish', 'throes', 'passion', ""'re"", 'masked', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'bout', 'Botox', 'left', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'New', 'Moon', 'Bella', 'shows', 'nearly', 'emotion', 'whatsoever', 'certain', 'points', 'film', 'battle', 'Ella', 'heart', 'really', 'started', 'resemble', 'scenes', 'Weekend', 'Bernie', 'Nonetheless', 'Team', 'Edward', 'Team', 'Jacob', 'must', 'put', 'aside', 'differences', 'collectively', 'protect', 'Bella', 'growing', 'coven', 'sadistic', 'newborn', 'vampires', 'army', 'spawned', 'bloodthirsty', 'vampire', 'Victoria', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'avenge', 'loss', 'lover', 'conspicuously', 'ravaging', 'Seattle', 'landscape.Meanwhile', 'Bella', 'vicissitudes', 'love', 'immortality', 'grow', 'tiresome', 'revealing', 'major', 'acting', 'flaws', 'bad', 'script', 'writing', 'dialogue', 'pale-faced', 'lovers', 'not', 'racial', 'vampire', 'reasons', 'lifeless', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'vampire', 'transformation', 'conversation', 'Uh-huh', 'followed', 'Nu-uh', 'When', 'Rosalie', 'being', 'frozen', 'never', 'moving', 'forward', 'immediately', 'up', 'why', 'Bella', 'who', 'have', 'Bell', 'palsy', 'Bella', 'palsy', 'so', 'readily', 'accepted', 'cold', 'undead', 'clan', 'beleaguered', 'choice', 'lovers', 'Edward', 'pedophile', 'stalker', 'tritagonist', 'Jacob', 'who', 'Bella', 'rapist', 'making', 'necrophilia-related', 'comments', 'loving', 'Bella', 'dead', 'situation', 'only', 'muddier', 'film.The', 'film', 'primary', 'positive', 'script', 'finally', 'surfaces', '20+', 'minutes', 'staring', 'contests', 'previous', 'two', 'Twilight', 'movies', 'fact', 'learning', 'rebirth', 'Jasper', 'Jackson', 'Rathbone', 'occurred', 'served', 'Cavalry', 'officer', 'Civil', 'War', 'discovering', 'Rosalie', 'Nikki', 'Reed', 'unfortunate', 'transformation', 'went', 'long', 'way', 'character', 'development', 'understanding', 'roles', 'Even', 'better', 'however', 'Quileute', 'folklore', 'told', 'great', 'reverence', 'Billy', 'Black', 'Gil', 'Birmingham', 'enjoyed', 'part', 'very', 'much', 'Somewhere', 'line', 'however', 'subplot-anchor', 'Volturi', 'evidently', 'ancient', 'vampire', 'word', 'meaning', 'rigid', 'acting', 'superfluous', 'script', 'nearly', 'nothing', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'removed', 'coherency', 'issues', 'Direction', 'was', 'also', 'notably', 'improved', 'over', 'prequels', 'should', 'come', 'surprise', 'tension', 'better', 'relayed', 'minimal', 'action', 'vicious', 'rushes', 'David', 'Slade', 'directedHard', 'Candyand30', 'Days', 'Nightbefore', 'tackling', 'Twilight', 'series.Twilight', 'addicts', 'will', 'want', 'fornicate', 'sequel', 'background', 'noise', 'Average', 'movies', 'fans', 'many', 'whom', 'probably', 'hated', 'original', 'thought', 'second', 'was', 'improvement', 'will', 'still', 'find', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'atrocious', 'acting', 'almost', 'intolerable', 'must', 'say', 'however', 'series', 'improving', 'luck', 'will', 'be', 'less', 'sparkling', 'fewer', 'staring', 'contests', 'series', 'more', 'details', 'various', 'characters', 'who', 'act', 'crutch', 'Stewart', 'weak', 'script']",N/A

After seeing the last installment I now know why these movies absolutely do not work for me. (I have not read any of the books, and please don't use that as an excuse as to why I don't like the movies).The Twilight series is filled with interesting characters and has a lot of interesting plot developments in it. Unfortunately the story follows the three worst characters and instead of concentrating telling the story of one of five to six interesting stories, it focuses on what is supposed to be a love story.I'll start with the characters......Bella Swan is a despicable person with no redeeming qualities. Would anyone actually want to even be associated with Bella Swan in real life? All I know is that she puts every single person in danger (including the vampire she is presumably in love with) all for purely selfish reasons. If her vampire plaything isn't around she decides to toy with the idiot werewolf boy who for some reason decides he likes this moping, selfish, unfriendly person. Has Bella Swan (which is a stupid name anyhow) ever uttered anything at all interesting or positive in the course of three movies?Let's move on to Edward. You would think after centuries of existing he would have A) found something better to do with his time than to graduate high school repeatedly? B) Developed at least a smidgeon of a personality C) Had enough time to find someone in this world that could offer him something more than Bella Swan? I get he can't read her mind (which he sees as a positive), but maybe that's because she doesn't have much in that head of hers? Honestly?And that leaves our pathetic werewolf pal who marches around shirtless (a joke about his shirtless ways was written in the Eclipse movie). He at least has a motorcycle hobby and outwardly seems friendly in the 1st movie (until he becomes a werewolf) and then because he becomes a central figure in this movie he must relinquish all semblance of a personality and become mad/sad. Why do I call this character pathetic? Because to constantly chase after someone who has been so outwardly disrespectful and just plain mean to you shows he has very little self respect for himself.And now why I don't think the ""love"" triangle works. First, none of the characters are likable or compelling as explained above. Secondly, other than saying they love each what has happened to make me believe it? I know Edward has saved Bella a few times (because she needlessly puts herself in danger, because she's moody, reckless and selfish) so maybe I can buy Bella liking Edward. But other than not reading her mind there's no reason for this vampire to like this girl (I guess her blood smells good, but that's more reason to kill her right?). I could care less who ends up with this girl. As far as I'm concerned, whoever does is the loser in this triangle.While watching the Eclipse, I felt the father echoed my thoughts. He seems bewildered at all the situations around him. Can't understand his daughter, doesn't like Edward. But he does really like Edward's sister Alice and so do I!Imagine how much better of movie or series it could be if it followed the character of Alice? Or how about the doctor vampire father? Or what about Jasper from the 1800's? Or even the vengeful vampire girl that kills her rapist attackers from the 1900's? Or what about the group of Werewolves that are eager to kill and seem to at least have fun together? Or....well you get the idea. All of the characters are more proactive in what seems to be a larger picture. Our characters are far more concerned about laying in fields of flowers saying they love each other. In between that we the audience are treated to ridiculous jealous banter between two immature idiots (the vampire vs. werewolf boy).So anyway, there is a lot to like in this series but instead we get left with the worst trio of characters possible in the movie. It could be a simple fix too. Why not give Bella a bigger destiny than just becoming a vampire's wife? (if there is one we should have had a lot more foreshadow) Why not make her a key player in a bigger story (and no, having a vamoire baby is not a bigger story). Would it be too much to have them fall in love while trying doing something interesting on the behalf of something larger in scale than themselves? What if she could be a key part of a prophecy that helps mankind or vampirekind? Then it would make a little bit of sense that Edwards entire family and the entire werewolf clan puts their lives on the line to protect her while Edward, Bella, and Werewolf boy hide on a mountaintop out of harms way. And by the way if you are trying to make out a vampire army sound invincible at least have one member from the ""heroes"" side die, even a side character would be a start. I don't believe that band of young vampires was very formidable since all twenty or thirty were killed without them barely inflicting any damage to the good guy side. It's all just fluff in the end, nothing really happened.So blah! Tell me why I'm wrong Twilight fans. While you do that please tell me what redeeming values Bella Swan has without telling lies or using references from the book series. Any positive character traits at all?

They each bring their own strengths and visions, thus keeping the whole process fresh. It can't never truly be like the books cause cinema and literature aren't the same art form. They both have their own rules. But I find it fun to see what part of the story will remain and what part will not.  Especially considering the fact that a new book came out portraying one of the new born vampires. We get to see parts of that small book on the screen and that was a pleasant surprise.In ""Eclipse"", I was glad that the work was done by the director of ""30 Days Of Night"". You know right then that the action will be well handled. As for the more sentimental stuff, he can only put in the script what's already in the book. And even though a majority love the books, we can fairly say that they are also a bit cheesy (but not in a necessarily bad way). Inevitably, the film can only be ""cheesy"" at times. Again, that doesn't make them bad in any way. Just fun, entertaining and wonderfully cheesy. Like a guilty pleasure.I do find that all the actors and actresses were good (even getting better and better) but I still have a problem with Kristen Stewart. She blinks a little less but she just won't stop fidgeting in an unnatural way. It looks too much like acting. But I was pleasantly surprised by Robert Pattinson and how mature he appears. I still think that Taylor Lautner tries too hard to talk with a deep voice but his charisma wins over. I missed the terrifying calmness of Michael Sheen but I never get tired of Dakota Fanning. She really is chilling. But I miss Rachelle Lefebvre. Bryce Dallas Howard is a gifted and beautiful actress. But Rachelle has an edge that is truly hers. She appears strong. Bryce appeared weak. I do not remember Victoria as a weak person even though she gets more or less easily killed. Bryce doesn't scare me. Rachelle does (I'm not really scared but you know what I mean).I'm still dumbfounded though to see how much people seem to not like ""New Moon"". Although I enjoyed ""Eclipse"", I feel like the second opus was the best movie so far. Not only in term of the story but also in terms of the directing. I really felt like Chris Weitz cared for his characters. Don't get me wrong, I like David Slade and I liked the ""Eclipse"" movie. But I do feel like this third act was more a case of delivering what was in the book than it was an act of love from the director.Now, I can't wait to see what Bill Condon will do with ""Breaking Dawn"". How lucky the fans of ""Twilight"" are to have him close the final chapter to this cheesy but truly fun saga.",3,An act of love or simply delivering the goods?,1278374400,"07 6, 2010",2010,3209,"['Whenever', 'go', 'see', 'Twilight', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'expecting', 'see', 'grandiloquence', 'Fellini', 'depth', 'Bergman', 'unconventional', 'dialogues', 'Jim', 'Jarmusch', 'know', 'what', 'kind', 'films', 'vampire', 'movies', 'are', 'first', 'target', 'audience', 'teenagers', 'then', 'adults', 'who', 'keep', 'teenagers', 'alive', 'course', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'find', 'films', 'are', 'made', 'honesty', 'true', 'desire', 'entertain', 'being', 'respectful', 'books.I', 'find', 'amazing', 'witness', 'talented', 'filmmakers', 'next', 'one', 'being', 'Bill', 'Condon', 'relaying', 'other', 'order', 'bring', 'stories', 'alive', 'bring', 'own', 'strengths', 'visions', 'thus', 'keeping', 'whole', 'process', 'fresh', 'ca', ""n't"", 'never', 'truly', 'be', 'books', 'cause', 'cinema', 'literature', 'are', ""n't"", 'same', 'art', 'form', 'have', 'own', 'rules', 'find', 'see', 'what', 'part', 'story', 'will', 'remain', 'what', 'part', 'will', 'not', 'Especially', 'considering', 'fact', 'new', 'book', 'came', 'out', 'portraying', 'one', 'new', 'born', 'vampires', 'get', 'see', 'parts', 'small', 'book', 'screen', 'was', 'pleasant', 'surprise.In', 'Eclipse', 'was', 'glad', 'work', 'was', 'done', 'director', '30', 'Days', 'Night', 'know', 'right', 'then', 'action', 'will', 'be', 'well', 'handled', 'more', 'sentimental', 'stuff', 'can', 'only', 'put', 'script', 'what', 'already', 'book', 'even', 'majority', 'books', 'can', 'fairly', 'say', 'are', 'also', 'bit', 'cheesy', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'way', 'Inevitably', 'film', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'cheesy', 'times', 'Again', ""n't"", 'make', 'bad', 'way', 'Just', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'wonderfully', 'cheesy', 'guilty', 'pleasure.I', 'do', 'find', 'actors', 'actresses', 'were', 'good', 'even', 'getting', 'better', 'better', 'still', 'have', 'problem', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'little', 'less', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stop', 'fidgeting', 'unnatural', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'acting', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', 'how', 'mature', 'still', 'think', 'Taylor', 'Lautner', 'too', 'hard', 'talk', 'deep', 'voice', 'charisma', 'missed', 'terrifying', 'calmness', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'never', 'get', 'tired', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'really', 'chilling', 'miss', 'Rachelle', 'Lefebvre', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'gifted', 'beautiful', 'actress', 'Rachelle', 'edge', 'truly', 'hers', 'strong', 'Bryce', 'appeared', 'weak', 'do', 'not', 'remember', 'Victoria', 'weak', 'person', 'even', 'more', 'less', 'easily', 'killed', 'Bryce', ""n't"", 'scare', 'Rachelle', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'scared', 'know', 'what', 'mean', '.I', ""'m"", 'still', 'dumbfounded', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'people', 'seem', 'not', 'like', 'New', 'Moon', 'enjoyed', 'Eclipse', 'feel', 'second', 'opus', 'was', 'best', 'movie', 'so', 'far', 'Not', 'only', 'term', 'story', 'also', 'terms', 'directing', 'really', 'felt', 'Chris', 'Weitz', 'cared', 'characters', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'like', 'David', 'Slade', 'liked', 'Eclipse', 'movie', 'do', 'feel', 'third', 'act', 'was', 'more', 'case', 'delivering', 'what', 'was', 'book', 'was', 'act', 'love', 'director.Now', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'Bill', 'Condon', 'will', 'do', 'Breaking', 'Dawn', 'How', 'lucky', 'fans', 'Twilight', 'are', 'have', 'close', 'final', 'chapter', 'cheesy', 'truly', 'fun', 'saga']",N/A

With a few exceptions, notably Billy Burke as Charlie Swan, the acting is from hunger, the storyline improbable (vampires are improbable enough, but sparkly vampires?  Who'da thunk it?), and character development is practically non-existent.  But the movies do have a certain silly charm, especially Robert Pattinson's self-deprecating performance as Edward Cullen (and my God, he is so gorgeous he should have his own pin-up calendar), and Ashley Greene as his ditzy sister.  I can't help liking her.  Kristin Stewart was just plain irritating in the first two films but she's improved a lot in this movie.  Maybe she's finally learning.""Eclipse"" is starting to grow on me.  The first time I watched it I couldn't stand it.  Then last night I saw it again on cable TV and actually enjoyed it in spots.  Maybe I wasn't in the right mood when I saw it the first time, but I love a good romance and the romance between Edward and Bella is really touching and sweet.  Especially Edward's explanation of why he insists on no sex before marriage: he wants to re-live the old-fashioned way of courtship he was cheated of when he was made a vampire.  I also thought the Cullens had more depth and dimension than they did in the other movies.  They aren't just a happy family, they're a close-knit family whose very existence is threatened by some newbies who don't know how to act right.Jacob, however... my God, I wanted to slap that boy upside the head.  Not that I didn't enjoy Taylor Lautner's performance, which I thought was the best of the three leads, but good lord, what is it with this guy that he can't take no for an answer?  Buy a vowel, get a clue, she wants Edward, she doesn't want you.  His obsession with Bella isn't romantic, it's irritating and immature.  She tells him she doesn't reciprocate his feelings for her; he tells her he's not buying it.  What isn't he buying?  He might as well throw a tantrum and tell her never mind how you feel, it's all about me.  He may be in love but he's got the emotional maturity of an eight year old.  And his justification of imprinting is chilling.  What girl wouldn't want a guy who imprinted on her?  A girl who likes to make up her own mind, that's who.  Actually, Meyer's big ""triangle"" is no triangle at all; it's two people in love and a third who won't take the hint that there's no room for him.  Jacob has some major growing up to do.The backstories of Jasper and Rosalie don't add anything to the film except to take up time, and the intrusion of the evil Volturi toward the movie's end seems more like an afterthought tacked onto the story, but taken as a whole, ""Eclipse"" isn't a bad addition to the ""Twilight"" series.  At least it's more fun to watch than Edward and Bella's interminable angst in ""New Moon"".  And it's got a lovely, upbeat ending, for those who like their movies to end on a positive.Judy Lind",3,Not as dumb as I first thought...,1301702400,"04 2, 2011",2011,3004,"['Everybody', 'own', 'list', 'Crappy', 'Movies', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Help', 'Watching', 'Twilight', 'movies', 'have', 'prominent', 'place', 'mine', 'few', 'exceptions', 'notably', 'Billy', 'Burke', 'Charlie', 'Swan', 'acting', 'hunger', 'storyline', 'improbable', 'vampires', 'are', 'improbable', 'enough', 'sparkly', 'vampires', ""Who'da"", 'character', 'development', 'practically', 'non-existent', 'movies', 'do', 'have', 'certain', 'silly', 'charm', 'especially', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', 'self-deprecating', 'performance', 'Edward', 'Cullen', 'God', 'so', 'gorgeous', 'should', 'have', 'own', 'pin-up', 'calendar', 'Ashley', 'Greene', 'ditzy', 'sister', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'liking', 'Kristin', 'Stewart', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'irritating', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'improved', 'lot', 'movie', 'Maybe', 'finally', 'learning', 'Eclipse', 'starting', 'grow', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'Then', 'last', 'night', 'saw', 'again', 'cable', 'TV', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'spots', 'Maybe', 'was', ""n't"", 'right', 'mood', 'when', 'saw', 'first', 'time', 'love', 'good', 'romance', 'romance', 'Edward', 'Bella', 'really', 'touching', 'sweet', 'Especially', 'Edward', 'explanation', 'why', 'sex', 'marriage', 're-live', 'old-fashioned', 'way', 'courtship', 'was', 'cheated', 'when', 'was', 'made', 'vampire', 'also', 'thought', 'Cullens', 'had', 'more', 'depth', 'dimension', 'did', 'other', 'movies', 'are', ""n't"", 'just', 'happy', 'family', ""'re"", 'close-knit', 'family', 'very', 'existence', 'threatened', 'newbies', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'act', 'right.Jacob', 'however', 'God', 'wanted', 'slap', 'boy', 'head', 'Not', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'Taylor', 'Lautner', 'performance', 'thought', 'was', 'best', 'three', 'leads', 'good', 'lord', 'what', 'guy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'answer', 'Buy', 'vowel', 'get', 'clue', 'Edward', ""n't"", 'want', 'obsession', 'Bella', ""n't"", 'romantic', 'irritating', 'immature', ""n't"", 'reciprocate', 'feelings', 'not', 'buying', 'What', ""n't"", 'buying', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'throw', 'tantrum', 'tell', 'never', 'mind', 'how', 'feel', 'may', 'be', 'love', 'got', 'emotional', 'maturity', 'eight', 'year', 'old', 'justification', 'imprinting', 'chilling', 'What', 'girl', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'guy', 'who', 'imprinted', 'A', 'girl', 'who', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'mind', 'who', 'Actually', 'Meyer', 'big', 'triangle', 'triangle', 'two', 'people', 'love', 'third', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'take', 'hint', 'room', 'Jacob', 'major', 'growing', 'up', 'do.The', 'backstories', 'Jasper', 'Rosalie', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'anything', 'film', 'take', 'up', 'time', 'intrusion', 'evil', 'Volturi', 'movie', 'end', 'more', 'afterthought', 'tacked', 'story', 'taken', 'whole', 'Eclipse', ""n't"", 'bad', 'addition', 'Twilight', 'series', 'least', 'more', 'fun', 'watch', 'Edward', 'Bella', 'interminable', 'angst', 'New', 'Moon', 'got', 'lovely', 'upbeat', 'ending', 'who', 'like', 'movies', 'end', 'positive.Judy', 'Lind']",N/A

1240200,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B001UV4XFG,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[1, 2]","Eclipse is the third film in the wildly popular Twilight Saga. As of this writing it's the fourth highest grossing film of 2010, yet holds a 4.8 on imdb and a 50% on Rotten Tomatoes. No matter how hard they try, critics can't stop this franchise. I found the first two films abysmal in almost every way, but I did feel New Moon fleshed out the characters a bit more than the first film. With that said, Eclipse stands as the best film in the series...But that's not to say it's particularly good.Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) and Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) are now officially a couple and Bella is determined to have Edward change her into a vampire after graduation. Edward, meanwhile, is determined to have Bella marry him. Bella's father Charlie (Billy Burke) wants Bella to spend less time with Edward and more time with Jacob (Taylor Lautner), who feels Bella is in love with him and would be making a mistake letting Edward change her. While the film's main focus is the love triangle between the three, the plot this time revolves around Victoria (Bryce Dallas Howard, replacing a no-name actress) assembling an army of vampires to seek revenge on the Cullen clan.The latest director to tackle the franchise, David Slade, handles this material much better than his predecessors, particularly the action scenes, but he also reinforces my opinion that no director could make this dreck convincing. Slade achieves in the film's main battle scene what Catherine Hardwicke and Chris Weitz failed to in their films, which is achieve a genuine sense of excitement and suspense even. Ah hell, it's an entertaining scene. Slade achieves something unheard of in directing one of these films, but even he can't overcome the poor script and insipid dialogue.Nearly all the characters in these films are caricatures of people I hated in high school. Bella is such a childish, selfish protagonist you have to wonder why a vampire who is over 100 years old would even bother with her. Even more remarkable is that Jacob, despite actually being Bella's age, seems much more emotionally intelligent than Edward. I can't fathom how people take this plot seriously as a ""love story,"" when not a single moment seems natural and not a single aspect of the ""romance"" seems poignant. I noticed in the previous film that Stewart and Lautner had more chemistry than Stewart and Pattison and even offered a hint of credibility for a brief moment. While Pattinson and Stewart seem more comfortable around each other than ever before, there's still awkwardness between them that isn't there between her and Lautner.Melissa Rosenberg (who has no business calling herself a writer) seems to have lightened up slightly on the melodramatic, repetitive drivel that's supposed to serve as dialogue but having not read the books, maybe that's because Stephanie Meyer did. With that said, there's still enough gag-worthy dialogue to complain about. Jacob's description of ""imprinting"" to Bella is so juvenile and clich&eacute;d, I won't even bother typing it. With that said, the film lightens up a bit when it skates close to self-parody; I'm not going to lie, I giggled when Edward blurts out ""Doesn't he own a shirt?"" upon seeing Jacob.After watching all three of these films I began to notice how cheeky the Twilight films can be sometimes, as if they know and expect the stupidity of their audience. An example; when Rosalie (Nikki Reed) is explaining to Bella that once she's changed, there's something she'll want more than Edward, something she'll kill for. I know she means blood, you probably know she means blood. Why then must she elaborate on it further by saying ""blood!?"" If they don't know the stupidity of their audience, they certainly share it: When Bella's mom notices the ""intense"" connection between Bella and Edward; she remarks ""You're different with him. He moves, you move. Like magnets."" Oh, what a cute piece of dialogue. Except it makes no sense, because magnets f****** repel each other!As for the acting, it has improved over the course of three films. Pattinson doesn't look nauseous in every scene, which I applaud him for. There's actually some convincing acting between Pattinson and Lautner when discussing what's best for Bella inside a tent, if one ignores some of the ridiculous dialogue between the two. However, the confrontation between them after Jacob kisses Bella is laughably unconvincing until Lautner's hilarious delivery of ""I kissed Bella. And she broke her hand. Punching my face"" makes up for it. Bryce Dallas Howard, a capable actress, doesn't do anything miraculous as Victoria, but she doesn't embarrass herself either. Finally, I must give credit to Billy Burke. He has such a likeable presence throughout these films and he comes off so naturally as a caring father, he's one of the only actors to emerge from this series unscathed. Lastly, the wolves look more realistic in this film. The special effects are still not particularly good, but don't remain in the realm of a live-action Scooby-Doo film either.I've heard people say about this film ""it's better than the other two, but it's still Twilight."" In many cases, this would be an unfair critique indicating a bias. In the case of this film, it's an accurate assessment. Eclipse is much better than the previous two films, but it's still a part of the poorly written, lazily acted mess that Twilight is. I will admit that Eclipse is more entertaining and more capably made than the previous two films and as Eclipse is much more of an action film than the previous two, I can actually see a bit of the appeal that has previously escaped me. With that said, Eclipse is still not a good film by any means as it's plagued with the problems of the first two. Yes, each film has been somewhat better than what came before it but it's like saying the stomach tumor was better than the brain tumor.GRADE: C-",3,"Better than the first two, but it's still

The next day, the newspapers are talking about a serial killer in the Georgetown Alley area.  Bella's father, Charlie (the Forks policeman), talks with the parents of a missing teenage boy.Bella and Edward are still talking about their future, and this time about marriage. Bella still wants to be ""turned"" so she can NOT grow old with Edward.  She believes that right after upcoming graduation might be a good time. Not knowing about the upcoming wedding plans, Charlie wants Bella to see other friends, including Jacob (the werewolf), and spend a little less time with Edward.  Bella tries to re-establish contact with Jacob.  At the same time, she begins to think in terms of doing her ""farewells"" to people (like mom) who she won't see after she becomes a vampirette.Meanwhile, there is a group of ""Newborns"" forming a small army under Victoria.  The lively redheaded bloodsucker is still after Bella to revenge the death of her former bloodsucking beau.  (The Newborns are the term given to newly made vampires. In their first year of being turned, they are incredibly strong and vicious.) Victoria's plan is to use her army to destroy the Cullens and get Bella.Jacob also expresses his love for Bella and we again meet the werewolf clan, who agree to help with the Newborn situation. The Volkirie also appear to put their 2 cents in. (The head of the Board of Vampires.)The storyline is enjoyable, the scenery is great, and I love the wolves.  They are huge and so neat looking.  BTW, I have not read any of the books, so my review is based strictly on following all 3 movies.So, should Bella marry Edward and become a vampiress, or should she marry Jacob and have wolf puppies?

Times due change but the main theme of a young girl needing a knight to come to rescue her continue to infuse themselves into our newest films. In a mix of vampires and werewolves, The Twilight Films have capitalized on bringing a story to the screen that satisfies the girls romanticism of stories known mostly today as fairy tales.""Twilight: Eclipse,"" which opened last weekend is the third film in a series brought to screen as an adaption of the very popular books written by Stephenie Meyer. Bella, the central character played by Kristen Stewart, continues her relationship with her vampire boyfriend Edward, portrayed by Robert Pattinson. Bella is a self-admitted awkward teenager and her character has more complicated decisions than most teenagers. About to graduate from high school, it's not what college to select that concerns her. Her desire to be a vampire and evolve into a new and strange world is her main desire. Yet, there are battles to be won and hearts to be broken before things resolve. Taylor Lautner returns as Jacob along with all the vampires as well.""Twilight: Eclipse"" is a fair film on it's own, but for Twilight fans it is the best of the three films. This film has had a special effects upgrade and the story line allows the us to see in the past of the vampires long lives. There are quite a few breaks of humor that sparkle in the mist of such a dark story of even a darker world. Billy Burke, as Bella's father, provides the necessary anchor to make the story effective and he and Kristen Stewart share a few good father/daughter moments.It is truly a mistake to see this movie without viewing the previous films ""Twilight"" and ""New Moon,"" which luckily are out on DVD.

You can tell it's a wig big time they should have found a lighter brown to match her skin tone.  My opinion Eclipse isn't as good as the first movie Twilight at all.  I think the movies would have been much better if they're all directed by Catherine Hardwicke to eliminate the jumpiness of the films to me.  You can definitely tell there were different directors and the moods and feelings of the cast shines through.  I do think the other two directors were good at they're job but Summit should have just picked one director and stayed with it.  I also think that the only real actors that were really into the movie and captivated the characters were the quilette pack, Charlie, and Alice.  The others seemed out of character from the first movie and ruined it for me.On a good note the cgi wolves were awesome!  The fight scenes were great!  I do find it weird that when the vampires were ripped apart they crumbled like rock instead of how the would just rip apart like regular flesh in the first movie.  The crumbling effect was cool but it should have been started in the first movie not something that up and changes and they expect no one to notice.  The actor that played Riley captivated him perfectly!  He couldn't have been better!  And Jaspers accent, I know he didn't talk much in the first two movies but his accent got really thick all of a sudden in this third movie.What us up with changing the Victoria character.  I understand Rachael L was demanding more money and the picked someone else but she didn't seem to play the character as well.  And again the wig the new girl was wearing was atrocious!  Who did the costumes and the wig picking!?!?!  They need to step back and take a look at what they send out of the trailer.  I'm not a fan of how they portrayed Bella in this movie.  She acted like a brat, ya she didn't want them to fight over her but at least act like you care for one of them.  The internal strife that Kristen tried to play was way off from the book big time.  Maybe if they filmed these more closely to each other and with the same director they would seem like a contination not a shredded frayed ribbon where one ends and anther movie starts.

1240236,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B001UV4XFG,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[6, 12]","First of all, I do not think that ""Twilight"" is the worst thing to happen to American literature or cinema in the 21st century or whatever.  The fact that within 12 hours of opening its rating on the International Movie Data Base was 3-point-something surely does not express the judgment of the fanatics (and they boys they date) who paid $30 million to catch the special midnight showings this (early) morning.  I agree you do not need to see something to decide that it is bad, but I think you do need to see it to assign a valid number on a ten point rating scale.  I also think it is fairly obvious that if you have not seen the first two movies and/or read the first two books in Stephenie Meyer's series, then you are never going to be able to figure out what is happening in this one, but then the same thing applies for starting with ""The Return of the Jedi"" or ""The Return of the King.""  Come to think of it, I have to believe that virtually everybody reading these words has already decided whether or not they are going to see ""The Twilight Saga: Eclipse.""When last we left our heroine, Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart), she and her vampire boyfriend Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) had been given an ultimatum by theVolturi, that because Bella knows so much about vampires she has to become one or die.  This fits into Bella's plans because she wants to become a vampire and be with Edward forever.  Bella's best friend, Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner, who happens to be a werewolf, thinks he loves Bella as much as she loves Edward and does not want her to become a vampire because it is the sacred duty of all werewolves to kill vampires and then he would have to kill Bella.  Meanwhile, another vampire, Victoria (Bryce Dallas Howard, is out to kill Bella and thereby payback Edward for what happened at the end of the first movie.  So basically Bella wants to become a vampire and the two men in her life disagree with her decision, albeit for different reasons.The key to Bella Swan has two foundations; the first, that she loves Edward Cullen with all her heart and all her mind and all her soul, and the second, that she can love Jacob Black as a friend while loving Edward as a lover, or would be lover.  These two truths are something that I suspect most teenage girls can relate to.  That being said, I find Team Jacob people fascinating, because they are our contemporary children of the lost cause.  I keep thinking it is like reading an American History textbook, being very interested in the Civil War, and deciding to root for the Confederacy.  The conflict in this story comes from the inability of Jacob to understand these two rules, which means he becomes more and more of a jerk as the film goes along.  Because Edward and Jacob cannot have a fight to the finish, these conflicts play out mostly in conversation, and that is the biggest problem with this movie.  The vast majority of it consists of conversations, primarily between Bella, Edward and Jacob.  Basically all of the Bella and Edward conversations are a variation on her saying ""change me,"" him refusing and countering with ""marry me,"" her refusing and repeating as necessary.  The Bella and Jacob conversations are all variation on her saying ""I love you, but not that way,"" him insisting she does love him and it could be in that way, sprinkled with threats against Edward.  Edward and Jacob tell each other that Bella always loved them best and then threaten each other until Bella shows up, yells at both of them and goes off with whichever one is most ticked off at that moment to have one of those aforementioned conversational rounds.The best parts of this movie are the trio of flashbacks that happen during some more of those conversations with Bella.  Both Jasper (Jackson Rathbone) and Rosalie (Nikki Reed) tell their chilling but pertinent tales on how they became vampires, thereby moving beyond the one dimensional characters they had been in the previous films, and then there is the campfire story about the first encounter between the Quileute and the Cold Ones told by Billy Black (Gil Birmingham).  That last one could would have made for a nice prehistoric prequel, and reminded me of ""Ginger Snaps Back - The Beginning,"" one of my favorite werewolf movies.  I also liked what little we got to hear of the commencement address given by Jessica (Anna Kendrik) and basically anything that Alice (Ashley Greene) does in the film, but then across the board the women in this film come off better than the men.  The big battle in the film's climax has its moments, because for all the violence is uber-quick and more suggested that scene.  The idea of vampires as Cold Ones, in addition to providing the motive for the love triangle in a tent in a snowstorm scene, works to keep the PG-13 rating for this film: basically it is like snapping (or biting) off the limbs (and heads) of marble statues.  So there is neither fountains of blood nor clouds of dust, although when Emmett (Kellan Lutz) shatters a newbie's head with his fist, I have no idea why his fist does not explode too.  However, I have long held that the laws of vampirism are outside the realm of real world empiricism, so I suspend my disbelief and go along for the ride.  So the battel scene has its moments, but it ends with a moment whose outrageousness, if not absurdity, evoked laughter from the audience.Director David Slade showed he could do vampire action in ""30 Days of Night"" and also proved with ""Hard Candy"" that he can make a pretty good film where most of the action is mere conversation.  But neither Meyer's original story nor the screenplay by Melissa Rosenberg (who has done all three adaptations) give Slade much to deal with beyond the short spurts of action and all the conversations, which might be part of the reason he is not doing the final two-part installment.  I find it extremely telling that Bella's conversations with her dad, Charlie (Billy Burke), or with any other characters besides Edward and Jacob, work pretty well.  But since most of the movie is those three talking, that becomes a big problem; there was only one moment when Jacob said something that I thought was a decent line.  Bella's opening lines might be the best in the movie, but she's quoting a famous Robert Frost poem that provides an obvious metaphor for her love triangle.  I have no doubt that young people look at this movie differently than I do, because I well being caught up in a romantic rapture when first watching the balcony scene in Franco Zefferelli's ""Romeo & Juliet"" in the theatre and then, twenty years later, laughing at the same scene because it shows two horny kids at the end of their first date.  There is a reason ""Twilight"" has the demographic that it does.  Final Note: It does not help that the last trailer they showed before the movie started was for ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,"" which is a pointed reminder of the relative shallowness of the Twilight universe (although it should be mentioned that the Harry Potter trailer sandwiches its montage between the two confrontations with Voldemort that will come in Part 2, which is not out until next year).",3,They really need to punch up the conversations in this love triangle,1277942400,"07 1, 2010",2010,7167,"['First', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'Twilight', 'worst', 'thing', 'happen',

Again this is the kind of boyfriend you want ladies!Kristen Stewart plays Bella, and for me she is what a lot of us were as teenagers: depressed, lacking self confidence and unaware of how beautiful we are.

This director went for the action and left out the most important part..Bella & Edwards relationship..Everything is cut from the novel that had them in contact with each other..it was still more of a focus on Jacob cause he has a good body..i persume..The slumber parties were left out...most of The Graduation...nothing was told in the novel about The Newborns except speculation...so The Short Life was Bree was put into this movie.with just a bit of Eclipse mixed in and it was horrid...makes me sad that such a magical series which is about 2 peoples relationship..is butchered in a movie...also Krisiten shows no emotion..she is like a statue..she never acts scared or frightened or anything..just stony faced..I did like the toning down of the lipstick as thought it looks ridiculous on men...the fight scene was ok and the flash backs..the scenery was added in most of it and when Jacob the wolf is standing next to Bella..it is so fake looking..the fight between Victoria and Edward was not as in the book..in this movie he was sort of taunting her and Bella stood there jsut staring like ""Oh well"" if some vampire was trying to kill me i would be trying to hide or something..and in the book..she did not cut herself..Directors do not think anyone will remember what is in the books..so they jsut take it and change to suit themselves..I guess men liked this movie, as it was fighting..but i feel The Book Bree should not have been the focus of this one and the ending where Bella says ""she does not want to be a vampire cause of Edward"" that was soo wrong! all through the books ..she wants to become a vampire to be with him..not cause she fancies the lifestyle...they should sit down and think hard about the last movies Breaking Dawn and try to give us the novel..the magic and maybe add romance to the honeymoon part..as it was hardly there to none in the book..doesn't have to be dirty or nude..but they can make us think they are nude and have more than Bella walking in the water..then that is the end of it all..I hope they do Breaking Dawn right..or it will be frustrating for those of us who have read the books..",3,Disappointing-Eclipse,1280793600,"08 3, 2010",2010,2298,"['was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'watching', 'movie', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Directors', 'even', 'read', 'novels', 'get', 'out', 'set', 'try', 'make', 'book', 'come', 'life', 'director', 'went', 'action', 'left', 'out', 'most', 'important', 'part..Bella', 'Edwards', 'relationship..Everything', 'cut', 'novel', 'had', 'contact', 'other..it', 'was', 'still', 'more', 'focus', 'Jacob', 'cause', 'good', 'body..i', 'persume..The', 'slumber', 'parties', 'were', 'left', 'out', 'most', 'Graduation', 'nothing', 'was', 'told', 'novel', 'Newborns', 'speculation', 'so', 'Short', 'Life', 'was', 'Bree', 'was', 'put', 'movie.with', 'just', 'bit', 'Eclipse', 'mixed', 'was', 'horrid', 'sad', 'magical', 'series', '2', 'peoples', 'relationship..is', 'butchered', 'movie', 'also', 'Krisiten', 'emotion..she', 'statue..she', 'never', 'scared', 'frightened', 'anything..just', 'stony', 'faced..I', 'did', 'toning', 'lipstick', 'thought', 'ridiculous', 'men', 'fight', 'scene', 'was', 'ok', 'flash', 'backs..the', 'scenery', 'was', 'added', 'most', 'when', 'Jacob', 'wolf', 'standing', 'next', 'Bella..it', 'so', 'fake', 'looking..the', 'fight', 'Victoria', 'Edward', 'was', 'not', 'book..in', 'movie', 'was', 'sort', 'taunting', 'Bella', 'stood', 'jsut', 'staring', 'Oh', 'well', 'vampire', 'was', 'trying', 'kill', 'i', 'would', 'be', 'trying', 'hide', 'something..and', 'book..she', 'did', 'not', 'cut', 'herself..Directors', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'anyone', 'will', 'remember', 'what', 'books..so', 'jsut', 'take', 'change', 'suit', 'themselves..I', 'guess', 'men', 'liked', 'movie', 'was', 'fighting..but', 'i', 'feel', 'Book', 'Bree', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'focus', 'one', 'ending', 'where', 'Bella', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'vampire', 'cause', 'Edward', 'was', 'soo', 'wrong', 'books', '..she', 'become', 'vampire', 'be', 'him..not', 'cause', 'lifestyle', 'should', 'sit', 'down', 'think', 'hard', 'last', 'movies', 'Breaking', 'Dawn', 'try', 'give', 'novel..the', 'magic', 'maybe', 'add', 'romance', 'honeymoon', 'part..as', 'was', 'hardly', 'there', 'none', 'book..does', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'dirty', 'can', 'make', 'think', 'are', 'nude', 'have', 'more', 'Bella', 'walking', 'water..then', 'end', 'hope', 'do', 'Breaking', 'Dawn', 'right..or', 'will', 'be', 'frustrating', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'books..']",N/A

I won't go into details about the plot, as I'm sure most moviegoers have already read the book. For the most part, the film sticks pretty close to the novel. There are some great fight scenes, lots of Bella/Edward/Jacob drama, etc. I freely admit that Stephenie Meyer is a terrible writer, but I love all things vampire and these stories totally draw me in.The movie does a good job of cleaning up some of Meyer's ridiculous dialogue, although some lines are still comically bad. Other things that bugged me were that the outlines of the Cullen's amber contact lenses were clearly visible on screen, Bella's longer hairdo was so obviously a wig, and the outdoor scenes that took place on a snowy mountaintop were so clearly superimposed that it was almost ridiculous. Also, although all the cougars out there will be thrilled with the many shirtless Jacob scenes in ""Eclipse,"" what really stuck out even more is Taylor Lautner's bad acting. (I mean, it is REALLY bad.) I was not too thrilled with the new Victoria (although she has better hair than the other one). I will say that Robert Pattinson's acting has gotten much better than it was in the last film, and my favorite scenes were by far the ones that included Bella's dad, Charlie, who always manages to steal the show with his one-liners.Despite all the silliness, if you appreciate these movies for what they are (vampire fluff), I'm sure you will enjoy ""Eclipse,"" as did I (although I laughed through the whole thing).",4,A superficial review of a superficial movie,1279324800,"07 17, 2010",2010,1571,"['enjoyed', 'film', 'more', 'New', 'Moon', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'much', 'original', 'Twilight', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'details', 'plot', ""'m"", 'sure', 'most', 'moviegoers', 'have', 'already', 'read', 'book', 'most', 'part', 'film', 'sticks', 'pretty', 'close', 'novel', 'are', 'great', 'fight', 'scenes', 'lots', 'Bella/Edward/Jacob', 'drama', 'etc', 'freely', 'admit', 'Stephenie', 'Meyer', 'terrible', 'writer', 'love', 'things', 'vampire', 'stories', 'totally', 'draw', 'in.The', 'movie', 'good', 'job', 'cleaning', 'up', 'Meyer', 'ridiculous', 'dialogue', 'lines', 'are', 'still', 'comically', 'bad', 'Other', 'things', 'bugged', 'were', 'outlines', 'Cullen', 'amber', 'contact', 'lenses', 'were', 'clearly', 'visible', 'screen', 'Bella', 'longer', 'hairdo', 'was', 'so', 'obviously', 'wig', 'outdoor', 'scenes', 'took', 'place', 'snowy', 'mountaintop', 'were', 'so', 'clearly', 'superimposed', 'was', 'almost', 'ridiculous', 'Also', 'cougars', 'will', 'be', 'thrilled', 'many', 'shirtless', 'Jacob', 'scenes', 'Eclipse', 'what', 'really', 'stuck', 'out', 'even', 'more', 'Taylor', 'Lautner', 'bad', 'acting', 'mean', 'REALLY', 'bad', 'was', 'not', 'too', 'thrilled', 'new', 'Victoria', 'better', 'hair', 'other', 'one', 'will', 'say', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', 'acting', 'gotten', 'much', 'better', 'was', 'last', 'film', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'were', 'far', 'ones', 'included', 'Bella', 'dad', 'Charlie', 'who', 'always', 'steal', 'show', 'one-liners.Despite', 'silliness', 'appreciate', 'movies', 'what', 'are', 'fluff', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'enjoy', 'Eclipse', 'did', 'laughed', 'whole', 'thing']",N/A

But she still chooses Edward and the beginnings of a feud with the Volturi start.

Victoria creates an army and with the help of the werewolves they defeat Victoria's army.  Bella finally makes a final choice between Edward and Jacob.  Of course she chooses Edward but reveals that she is not just choosing him but his world.  Despite all the bad things that come with it Bella lets Edward know that is where she knows that she belongs.

I should point out, I haven't read the books so my opinion is based soley on what is on the screen.It was a let down for me, in two major areas. First area, the characters were a downer. I didn't burn for them, I wasn't captivated and riveted to the screen. In fact, the only character that I found compelling was Taylor Lautner's performances. Added to this, that the ""bad guys"" didn't come across all that bad. I wasn't repulsed or made afraid by them, and I feel I should have been. That's why you have the ""bad guys"", because they are really bad dudes. It's what helps with the conflict and tension of the story. Now, to be fair, this lacking could very well go back to the author of the books and not to the director or scriptwriter.The second area that I found lacking, was the visual portrayal of the story, which I also had an issue with on the first movie. Make-up bothered me again.I'd watch it again just for Lautner, and to be reminded how not to tell a story, but that would be about it.",3,"Tea: Drinkable, not ""have to have""",1325289600,"12 31, 2011",2011,1053,"['Overall', 'miss', 'movie', 'series', 'should', 'point', 'out', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'books', 'opinion', 'based', 'soley', 'what', 'screen.It', 'was', 'let', 'down', 'two', 'major', 'areas', 'First', 'area', 'characters', 'were', 'downer', 'did', ""n't"", 'burn', 'was', ""n't"", 'captivated', 'riveted', 'screen', 'fact', 'only', 'character', 'found', 'compelling', 'was', 'Taylor', 'Lautner', 'performances', 'Added', 'bad', 'guys', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'bad', 'was', ""n't"", 'repulsed', 'made', 'afraid', 'feel', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'why', 'have', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'really', 'bad', 'dudes', 'what', 'conflict', 'tension', 'story', 'Now', 'be', 'fair', 'lacking', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'go', 'back', 'author', 'books', 'not', 'director', 'scriptwriter.The', 'second', 'area', 'found', 'lacking', 'was', 'visual', 'portrayal', 'story', 'also', 'had', 'issue', 'first', 'movie', 'Make-up', 'bothered', 'again.I', ""'d"", 'watch', 'again', 'just', 'Lautner', 'be', 'reminded', 'how', 'not', 'tell', 'story', 'would', 'be']",N/A
1240304,AM6QHTYPZ62UT,B001UV4XFG,Ray Cassavaugh,"[1, 3]","I really liked the first Twilight movie and was sorely disappointed in the the second one, although the last 20 to 30 minutes were pretty exciting. Eclipse is easily the best of the series and I can safely predict that will still hold true after the 4th movie is out.  I liked Eclipse so much, I decided to buy the 4th book now instead of waiting for the movie.  After reading a few reviews and a plot synopsis of the 4th in the series, I decided to definitely not waste my money on the book.Eclipse held every second of my attention from beginning to the closing credits. The balance of character development, plot structure and suspense as well as great action (despite far fewer and noticeably less elaborate/expensive special effects than the first 2 movies)made this movie the best.  I really cared about the characters and their futures. In the first two movies it was more about fascination with the situation than about the characters.Editing, sound, cinematography and general technical aspects seemed far tighter in the third of the series. The dialogue was more real, probably because by now I have fully accepted the implausible relationships of human girl, vampire family and werewolves.  The characters became more likable as we learn more about them and not so much about what is happening around them.  This is really a well done movie.At the end we can see Bella's plans and predict what we would hope happens in the next in the series.  Without spoiling anything, I am sure the 4th movie, like the second, will not fulfill the promise of Eclipse. There are a dozen better ways to end the series than what happens in the next installment. I will watch the movie some day but will not waste my time on a 700+ page book with the events I have learned.  Unless the next movie just about rewrites the book, as many reviewers have suggested should be done, you might want to just watch Eclipse again instead of buying the last movie.  Eclipse does not stand on its own, since it is part of a series, but is the only one to own if you had to pick just one.",5,Stop here - the 4th one can't be better,1298246400,"02 21, 2011",2011,2067,"['really', 'liked', 'first', 'Twilight', 'movie', 'was', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'second', 'one', 'last', '20', '30', 'minutes', 'were', 'pretty', 'exciting', 'Eclipse', 'easily', 'best', 'series', 'can', 'safely', 'predict', 'will', 'still', 'hold', 'true', '4th', 'movie', 'out', 'liked', 'Eclipse', 'so', 'much', 'decided', 'buy', '4th', 'book', 'now', 'instead', 'waiting', 'movie', 'reading', 'few', 'reviews', 'plot', 'synopsis', '4th', 'series', 'decided', 'definitely', 'not', 'waste', 'money', 'book.Eclipse', 'held', 'second', 'attention', 'beginning', 'closing', 'credits', 'balance', 'character', 'development', 'plot', 'structure', 'suspense', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'action', 'far', 'fewer', 'noticeably', 'less', 'elaborate/expensive', 'special', 'effects', 'first', '2', 'movies', 'made', 'movie', 'best', 'really', 'cared', 'characters', 'futures', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'was', 'more', 'fascination', 'situation', 'characters.Editing', 'sound', 'cinematography', 'general', 'technical', 'aspects', 'seemed', 'far', 'tighter', 'third', 'series', 'dialogue', 'was', 'more', 'real', 'probably', 'now', 'have', 'fully', 'accepted', 'implausible', 'relationships', 'human', 'girl', 'vampire', 'family', 'werewolves', 'characters', 'became', 'more', 'likable', 'learn', 'more', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'what', 'happening', 'really', 'well', 'done', 'end', 'can', 'see', 'Bella', 'plans', 'predict', 'what', 'would', 'hope', 'happens', 'next', 'series', 'spoiling', 'anything', 'am', 'sure', '4th', 'movie', 'second', 'will', 'not', 'fulfill', 'promise', 'Eclipse', 'are', 'dozen', 'better', 'ways', 'end', 'series', 'what', 'next', 'installment', 'will', 'watch', 'movie', 'day', 'will', 'not', 'waste', 'time', '700+', 'page', 'book', 'events', 'have', 'learned', 'next', 'movie', 'just', 'book', 'many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'suggested', 'should', 'be', 'done', 'might', 'want', 'just', 'watch', 'Eclipse', 'again', 'instead', 'buying', 'last', 'movie', 'Eclipse', 'not', 'stand', 'own', 'part', 'series', 'only', 'one', 'own', 'had', 'pick', 'just', 'one']",N/A
1240305,AFJFXN42RZ3G2,B001UV4XFG,"R. DelParto ""Rose2""","[2, 4]","The third installment of the vampire movie series, Twilight Saga:  Eclipse returns where the New Moon left off.  Tensions have now mounted between the three main characters Bella (Kristen Stewart), Edward (Robert Pattinson), and Jacob (Taylor Lautner).  As viewers will see the differing relationships have escalated to enormous heights in the form of the love triangle that trickles within the other subplots and characters of the film, the rise of the gang-like vampires the ""new borns,"" and the continuing problem that arose during the second film that involved the Volturi, the royal element to the vampire hierarchy who are easily identifiable with their cloaks, blood-red eyes, and somewhat sinister presence.But for the most part, the majority of the scenes in Eclipse involve the unique quality of vampire romance and the entanglement that Bella has gotten herself into between Edward and Jacob.  There is no denying that the competitiveness exists with the characters that come in the form of a combination of tongue in cheek and snide remarks from Edward and Jacob, but throughout the ordeal, Edward has the advantage because he has the power to read Bella and Jacob's mind as well as play mind tricks on anyone he encounters.  But as with the first and second films, Edward represents chivalry and virtuous traits of a by gone era, and emphatically tells Bella, ""when things were less complicated.""  And the other interesting aspects of the film that attempts to introduce two other members of the film associated with the Cullen clan and their ties to their vampire origins that also involved romantic issues, Jasper Hale (Jackson Rathbone), a Texas Cavalry officer during the Civil War who fell for the beautiful Vampiress (Monique Ganderton) and Rosalie Hale (Nikki Reed) who after a bad romance, has become an overprotective and vengeful vampire when anyone crosses her path.  These themes and issues are essential and show what may be in store for Bella if and when she enters the vampire realm.In spite of the hype and the mania that has accompanied the film, Eclipse is entertaining and enlightening.  The characters may or may not grow on viewers, but with all of the action packed scenes and the beautiful landscapes, there is bound to be a part of the film that will entice viewers.",5,"""Frozen means never moving forward...""",1278028800,"07 2, 2010",2010,2303,"['third', 'installment', 'vampire', 'movie', 'series', 'Twilight', 'Saga', 'Eclipse', 'returns', 'where', 'New', 'Moon', 'left', 'off', 'Tensions', 'have', 'now', 'mounted', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'Bella', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'Edward', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', 'Jacob', 'Taylor', 'Lautner', 'viewers', 'will', 'see', 'differing', 'relationships', 'have', 'escalated', 'enormous', 'heights', 'form', 'love', 'triangle', 'other', 'subplots', 'characters', 'film', 'rise', 'gang-like', 'new', 'borns', 'continuing', 'problem', 'arose', 'second', 'film', 'involved', 'Volturi', 'royal', 'element', 'vampire', 'hierarchy', 'who', 'are', 'easily', 'identifiable', 'cloaks', 'blood-red', 'eyes', 'somewhat', 'sinister', 'presence.But', 'most', 'part', 'majority', 'scenes', 'Eclipse', 'involve', 'unique', 'quality', 'vampire', 'romance', 'entanglement', 'Bella', 'gotten', 'Edward', 'Jacob', 'denying', 'competitiveness', 'characters', 'come', 'form', 'combination', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'snide', 'remarks', 'Edward', 'Jacob', 'ordeal', 'Edward', 'advantage', 'power', 'read', 'Bella', 'Jacob', 'mind', 'as', 'well', 'play', 'mind', 'tricks', 'anyone', 'first', 'second', 'films', 'Edward', 'chivalry', 'virtuous', 'traits', 'gone', 'era', 'emphatically', 'tells', 'Bella', 'when', 'things', 'were', 'less', 'complicated', 'other', 'interesting', 'aspects', 'film', 'introduce', 'two', 'other', 'members', 'film', 'associated', 'Cullen', 'clan', 'ties', 'vampire', 'also', 'involved', 'romantic', 'issues', 'Jasper', 'Hale', 'Jackson', 'Rathbone', 'Texas', 'Cavalry', 'officer', 'Civil', 'War', 'who', 'fell', 'beautiful', 'Vampiress', 'Monique', 'Ganderton', 'Rosalie', 'Hale', 'Nikki', 'Reed', 'who', 'bad', 'romance', 'become', 'overprotective', 'vengeful', 'vampire', 'when', 'anyone', 'path', 'themes', 'issues', 'are', 'essential', 'show', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'store', 'Bella', 'when', 'vampire', 'spite', 'hype', 'mania', 'accompanied', 'film', 'Eclipse', 'entertaining', 'enlightening', 'characters', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'grow', 'viewers', 'action', 'packed', 'scenes', 'beautiful', 'landscapes', 'bound', 'be', 'part', 'film', 'will', 'entice', 'viewers']",N/A

Thus I feel entitled to share, knowing that I'm not the target audience...although my wallet is the target!ECLIPSE is the third in the series of TWILIGHT movies, detailing the tortuous teen romance between Bella Swann (Kirsten Stewart), a brooding, vaguely depressed high schooler, and the vampire Edward and the werewolf Jacob.  Bella's true love is Edward (Robert Pattinson), but she also desires that he turn her into a vampire so they can be together forever.  Jacob (Taylor Lautner), hot-blooded and hunky, offers her a more ""normal"" life.  Both love Bella equally, but at least at this point in the story, it's pretty clear Bella favors Edward.This fraught romance is set in the midst of fairly uninteresting political and personal machinations revolving around vampire hierarchy and long-standing resentments between the werewolves and the vampires.  In ECLIPSE, a growing army of newly-created vampires is rising up in nearby Seattle, apparently building numbers in order to come after Bella, and Edward's family.  The werewolves get involved, as they rather put up with the ""vegetarian"" (only drink animal blood) Cullenses than this new group of sadistic killers.  There's some question of how involved the vampire leadership is in all this, but frankly, who cares?  These stories don't provide a balance between the romance and the action...they tilt heavily and unapologetically towards the romance.  The action is secondary.As with the other two films, the writing is the screen play equivalent of ""purple prose"" in many respects...lots of whispered declarations of undying love, heartache and promises that can't be met.  Lots of gazing into eyes.  Lots of hugging and PG-13 rated making-out.  Lots of Taylor Lautner without his shirt.  Lots of Bella wearing plaid shirts and hoodies...while all her classmates wear far more time-appropriate clothing.The movie is mildly interesting, but mostly it is annoying.  The bad script is not helped by the rather terrible acting.  Stewart, who has been good in other things, cannot make Bella a likeable character.  She is one of the most annoying teenagers ever put on screen...perfectly self-centered.  No one has ever felt love as acutely as she does.  No one has ever felt torn as she has.  She is the perfect encapsulation of all the worst qualities of teenage girls in love...and the film stubbornly refuses to make an effort to also find the joyful parts aspects of a teenage girl in love.  Pattinson simply continues to fail to be credible, and he is not helped but the worst haircut on film since Tom Hanks did THE DA VINCI CODE...it makes Pattinson's head look 40% too big!  He and Stewart really don't generate any real chemistry.  Yes, the clasp each other a lot and gaze at each other...but for two actors who are supposedly in love in real life, their passion is pretty inert.  Lautner is also not a good actor, but at least he has a lightness about him, a clear realization that he's become a mega-star by dumb luck (and many trips to Gold's Gym), and at least he can bring a sense of playfulness to his lighter scenes.  But as with Pattinson, when the script asks him to be pained and tormented, he mostly looks like he has a stomach ache.The best parts of these movies, to me, have always been the Cullen family.  Without diving into detail, they are an amusing and motley crew, with silly but somehow touching family dynamics.  They are a good group of vampires...tormented creatures who have helped each other retain all the humanity possible to vampires.  ECLIPSE gives us some background stories on this crew, and I really responded to this group more than ever.  Jackson Rathbone as Jasper continues to give the best, most amusing and original performance in the series, and I was so happy to see he was featured more in ECLIPSE.  I would happily see a film centered around HIS character.Also, the special effects continue to be sub-par.  These films are global phenomenons...yet the poorly rendered werewolves make the whole effort feel like the producers were trying to save every penny they could.  Surely someone could actually make werewolves that felt like they existed in the same space as the humans & vampires!If love these movies already, there's no reason you won't love ECLIPSE.  If you find them a pain to watch, then I would guess your reaction would roughly mirror mine.  But I know there's nothing I can say to change the mind of a fan (or foe) of THE TWILIGHT SAGA...but it's my opinion, and I'm stickin' to it!",3,"Best of the series, but that is not saying very

1240315,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B001UV4XFG,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 2]","***1/2Written by Melissa Rosenberg and directed by David Slade, ""The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"" is the third installment in the highly popular vampire-cum-werewolf teenage angst-fest based on the novels by Stephanie Meyer.Although Bella's tiresome romantic predicament - should she choose the vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) or the werewolf Jacob (Taylor Lautner)? - has been pretty much played out by this time (it's what ruined the second film, ""New Moon""), the script here does provide an intriguing internal conflict for the young woman (Kristen Stewart) as she debates the pros and cons of becoming a vampire herself after high school graduation.  She has to decide whether what she'll be gaining from such a move - eternal youth, a fulfilling life with Edward - outweighs what she'll be giving up - her father and mother, Jacob's friendship, and any hope of ever having a family of her own.  The movie also ramps up the drama a bit when a band of out-of-control ""newborn"" vampires start wreaking havoc across the Pacific Northwest, leading the more mature vampires and the werewolves - bitter, sworn enemies of one another - to join forces in defeating them.These ""Twilight"" films lack the cutting-edge wit and irony one finds in a series like ""True Blood,"" as Meyer opts for romantic sappiness over postmodern sophistication every step of the way.  And the over-earnest and self-important tone leads to some intense silliness along the way.  Still they do have their moments.",3,"uneven entry in the ""Twilight"" saga",1305158400,"05 12, 2011",2011,1481,"['***1/2Written', 'Melissa', 'Rosenberg', 'directed', 'David', 'Slade', 'Twilight', 'Saga', 'Eclipse', 'third', 'installment', 'highly', 'popular', 'vampire-cum-werewolf', 'teenage', 'angst-fest', 'based', 'novels', 'Stephanie', 'Meyer.Although', 'Bella', 'tiresome', 'romantic', 'predicament', 'should', 'choose', 'vampire', 'Edward', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', 'werewolf', 'Jacob', 'Taylor', 'Lautner', 'been', 'pretty', 'much', 'played', 'out', 'time', 'what', 'ruined', 'second', 'film', 'New', 'Moon', 'script', 'here', 'provide', 'intriguing', 'internal', 'conflict', 'young', 'woman', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'pros', 'cons', 'becoming', 'vampire', 'herself', 'high', 'school', 'graduation', 'decide', 'what', ""'ll"", 'be', 'gaining', 'move', 'eternal', 'youth', 'fulfilling', 'life', 'Edward', 'what', ""'ll"", 'be', 'giving', 'up', 'father', 'mother', 'Jacob', 'friendship', 'hope', 'ever', 'having', 'family', 'own', 'movie', 'also', 'up', 'drama', 'bit', 'when', 'band', 'out-of-control', 'newborn', 'vampires', 'start', 'wreaking', 'havoc', 'Pacific', 'Northwest', 'leading', 'more', 'mature', 'vampires', 'werewolves', 'bitter', 'sworn', 'enemies', 'one', 'join', 'forces', 'defeating', 'them.These', 'Twilight', 'films', 'lack', 'cutting-edge', 'wit', 'irony', 'one', 'series', 'True', 'Blood', 'Meyer', 'opts', 'romantic', 'sappiness', 'postmodern', 'sophistication', 'step', 'way', 'over-earnest', 'self-important', 'tone', 'intense', 'silliness', 'way', 'Still', 'do', 'have', 'moments']",N/A

1240327,A2BLRRNYU9XO9R,B001UV4XFG,S. Coleman,"[3, 5]","All in all, I say the folks in Hollywood did a pretty decent job with the third installment of the Twilight Saga. Every significant plot point was covered(some touched upon more than others), and I felt that the cinematography was a VAST improvement over the last two films. That gastly ethereal lighting from Twilight and New Moon is not present in Eclipse in such concentrated doses, and the action flows a bit more naturally. Also, despite a few overdramatic moments (notably, Jacob's sexy slow-turn introduction), the acting and dialogue showed a distinct improvement from the last two films. However, despite these positive aspects, I cannot help but feel that this film conveyed an unfair bias in Edward's favor that the book did not display. At the beginning of Stephenie Meyer's Eclipse novel, Bella was truly a conflicted young woman. Not only was she graduating high school in just a matter of weeks, but she was also dealing with having to say goodbye to her human life as she prepared to join the Cullen clan. Saying farewell brought the dual burden of convincing her parents that she going away to college in Alaska, meanwhile trying to patch things up with her werewolf best friend Jacob. But as Bella's life is put in danger and her graduation date draws near, she finds herself questioning what she really wants. Though Edward is her proclaimed true love and being apart has proved near-fatal for them in the past, she cannot help but admit that she loves Jacob as well. She admits to herself that life with him would be more practical. Not only could she stay human and have children, but she would never have to say goodbye to her friends and family--her father of whom would be totally ecstatic about her choice. However, though we all know by now that she ultimately chooses Edward in the end, the Eclipse film did not do a very good job of conveying the love triangle element. In the New Moon novel Bella and Jacob got very close, and though Edward returned and she went back to him, she still had feelings for Jake. But in the film, though Bella shows saddness in having to say goodbye to her mother and father, she has firmly decided whom she wants to be with. Instead of Jacob posing as a viable option, this film portrays him as the desperate best friend who has to resort to forcing himself on Bella to get some action. It is never any secret whom Bella really wants, and she does not reveal her true feelings for Jake as she did in the novel. Those who did not read the books before watching the movies will more than likely be confused, as the ""love triangle"" story line that they have heard so much about was not a true conflict, but instead two deeply devoted people who are constantly challenged by the girl's annoying best friend. If you are Team Edward, this bias will delight you to no end. But if you are Team Jacob--you'll be wanting to throw your DVD player against the wall 30 minutes into the film.",3,"Solid Effort, But Unfair Bias Between Eddie and Jake",1291420800,"12 4, 2010",2010,2937,"['say', 'folks', 'Hollywood', 'did', 'pretty', 'decent', 'job', 'third', 'installment', 'Twilight', 'Saga', 'Every', 'significant', 'plot', 'point', 'was', 'covered', 'touched', 'more', 'others', 'felt', 'cinematography', 'was', 'VAST', 'improvement', 'last', 'two', 'films', 'gastly', 'ethereal', 'lighting', 'Twilight', 'New', 'Moon', 'not', 'present', 'Eclipse', 'such', 'concentrated', 'doses', 'action', 'bit', 'more', 'naturally', 'Also', 'few', 'overdramatic', 'moments', 'notably', 'Jacob', 'sexy', 'slow-turn', 'introduction', 'acting', 'dialogue', 'showed', 'distinct', 'improvement', 'last', 'two', 'films', 'However', 'positive', 'aspects', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'feel', 'film', 'conveyed', 'unfair', 'bias', 'Edward', 'favor', 'book', 'did', 'not', 'display', 'beginning', 'Stephenie', 'Meyer', 'Eclipse', 'novel', 'Bella', 'was', 'truly', 'conflicted', 'young', 'woman', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'graduating', 'high', 'school', 'just', 'matter', 'weeks', 'was', 'also', 'dealing', 'having', 'say', 'goodbye', 'human', 'life', 'prepared', 'join', 'Cullen', 'clan', 'Saying', 'farewell', 'brought', 'dual', 'burden', 'convincing', 'parents', 'going', 'away', 'college', 'Alaska', 'meanwhile', 'trying', 'patch', 'things', 'up', 'werewolf', 'best', 'friend', 'Jacob', 'Bella', 'life', 'put', 'danger', 'graduation', 'date', 'draws', 'questioning', 'what', 'really', 'Though', 'Edward', 'proclaimed', 'true', 'love', 'being', 'apart', 'proved', 'near-fatal', 'past', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'admit', 'Jacob', 'as', 'well', 'herself', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'practical', 'Not', 'only', 'could', 'stay', 'human', 'have', 'children', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'say', 'goodbye', 'friends', 'family', 'father', 'whom', 'would', 'be', 'totally', 'ecstatic', 'choice', 'However', 'know', 'now', 'ultimately', 'Edward', 'end', 'Eclipse', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'conveying', 'love', 'triangle', 'element', 'New', 'Moon', 'novel', 'Bella', 'Jacob', 'got', 'very', 'close', 'Edward', 'returned', 'went', 'back', 'still', 'had', 'feelings', 'Jake', 'film', 'Bella', 'saddness', 'having', 'say', 'goodbye', 'mother', 'father', 'firmly', 'decided', 'whom', 'be', 'Instead', 'Jacob', 'posing', 'viable', 'option', 'film', 'desperate', 'best', 'friend', 'who', 'resort', 'forcing', 'Bella', 'get', 'action', 'never', 'secret', 'whom', 'Bella', 'really', 'not', 'reveal', 'true', 'feelings', 'Jake', 'did', 'novel', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'read', 'books', 'watching', 'movies', 'will', 'more', 'likely', 'be', 'confused', 'love', 'triangle', 'story', 'line', 'have', 'heard', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'not', 'true', 'conflict', 'instead', 'two', 'deeply', 'devoted', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'constantly', 'challenged', 'girl', 'annoying', 'best', 'friend', 'are', 'Team', 'Edward', 'bias', 'will', 'delight', 'end', 'are', 'Team', 'Jacob', ""'ll"", 'be', 'wanting', 'throw', 'DVD', 'player', 'wall', '30', 'minutes', 'film']",N/A

Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[0, 1]","Cons: I enjoyed the special features on Disc 2, but in three movies, Taylor Lautner is never in the commentary. Every single time I see him do an interview, he's hilarious. I hope SOMEBODY will let (make?) him do commentary in ""Breaking Dawn"" because he hasn't been in the last three, and I wanted to hear what he had to say during the tent scene. The special features also had a lot of random stuff about him throwing a football and catching grapes in his mouth but nothing about the Quileute fictional tribe or those actors. Don't they talk? I've sat in on an interview with Alex Meraz so I know he's funny, but what about the rest of the folks?Pros: I enjoyed this film. This was the very first ""Twilight"" film I saw earlier this year, and I'd never heard of the books or the movies. I just happened to be at a movie theater and nothing else was on. I'd heard Lil' C (from ""Rize"") debating about Team Edward versus Team Jacob on Twitter, and I honestly thought he was talking about krumpers. I should be embarrassed to admit this, but I went on YouTube trying to find the krumpers dance, but it turned out to be this film. The idea of watching a film about werewolves and vampires wasn't something I planned on watching in this lifetime, but again, nothing else was playing. I left that movie theater completely obsessed with all things ""Twilight."" I bought all the books, including the one about Bree, bought all the movies, went to the Twilight Convention in Chicago and interviewed a couple cast members, and people knew I was so hardcore about it that I even got a ""Twilight"" birthday card last month. Before this film, I had no desire to read about stuff like this, but Meyer had a way of making the vampires and werewolves seem more human than fictional.I think all of the cast did a phenomenal job at their roles, although I'm 100% Team Jacob. The tent scene was my favorite scene, and I just use the ""Jump To"" special feature to go directly to all of Taylor Lautner scenes.

1240354,AQJSMLYHE6GN4,B001UV4XFG,"StarReviewer ""SR""","[11, 13]","Like many viewers, I'd read the book Eclipse before seeing the movie. I also read 'the short second life of bree tanner' (see my review on).What Was Different From the Book; Some events were rushed or out of order. Bella's graduation was pretty short. The scene where Jacob 'kidnaps' her from school wasn't as dramatic as in the book (darn!). There were some short scenes from 'Bree Tanner' but certainly not the whole novella (no Diego or Freaky Fred).There were also a few additional scenes that showed Riley becoming a vampire and how Victoria manipulates him. What bothered me most was that we don't see how much the scent of Bella's blood tortures Bree - an important scene in the book.What Was the Same; The akward 'sex talk' Charlie tries to have with Bella when he thinks she and Edward are 'doing it.' Brilliantly done, the entire theater was laughing hysterically and clapping. Aside from many scenes being out of order, the book was followed very well. Nothing was changed drastically, only a few scenes were added to illustrate what was going on. Victoria is now played by Bryce Dallas Howard; the wide-eyes and childish voice she uses may seem out of character for a vampire,but if you've read the book you'll be haunted by how perfectly the role is played.More Info; I really liked this movie. It had a lot of laughs without being phony, exciting, and the acting has gotten much better.For Parents; There are sexual references and an almost sex scene. The violence isn't bad, the dead vampires look like broken procelin, no guts. The goriest thing we see is a fire with blackened shapes in it (the dead vampires burning)Without futhur ado...GO SEE THE MOVIE!!!

1240356,AZJB0HAT6GLHZ,B001UV4XFG,Sue C. Dees,"[1, 2]","As a devout Twilight series fan, and a great grandmother not a teenager, I waited impatiently for this movie. This book is one of my favorites in the series second only to Breaking Dawn. Having read Eclipse 3 times I can quote passages by heart. The movie was good and would have been better if I was not so acutely aware of the cuts and changes made to the story. The most irritating of all the changes was the mountain setting where Victoria and Riley attack Edward, Bella and Seth. This was so poorly represented that I was actually angry. It portrayed Bella as heroic and injuring herself in an attempt to distract Victoria and Riley from attacking Edward who according to the movie was in serious danger. This simply did not happen. Bella did NOT cut herself with the rock. Edward killed Riley in short order when he realized that Bella had picked up the rock and then he dispatched Victoria with ease. Bella's motivation in picking up the rock was not to save Edward but Seth. The other change came earlier and again irritated me when it was made to appear that it was Edward's idea to sit out the battle instead of the petty manipulation performed by Bella to get what she wanted. I didn't like the obvious efforts to make Bella the heroine in the movie. The only one worth their salt in the story is EDWARD.

The movie is filled with numerous flashbacks, primarily to the 19th century. Unlike the Harry Potter series where the acting improves from one movie to the next, this one does not. No wait. It is not bad acting. We discover that newbie vampires are uncontrollable and emotional. Vampires that are uncontrollable must be destroyed, so only unemotional vampires, who simply appear to be bad actors survive. They in turn like the aroma of infrequent bathers and wig wearers who are also bad actors, i.e unemotional. So that explains it. They are supposed to be unemotional. Why the werewolves, who look like an underage male revue sucked, I don't know.The most painful scenes are the one on one dialouge scenes. Here their ""unemotional"" ability comes out. Unfortunately this consists of too much of the movie as I kept yelling at the screen, ""Get on with it!"" Besides Edward's glitter, what is also unnatural is Kristen's hairline. I kept waiting for her fake hair to fall off. Young females will certainly rate this as 5 stars as the whole unnatural world is fighting over one of them, one that lacks a great body, personality, or hygiene. (Just a joke about the hygiene as everything unnatural keeps sniffing her scent.)Kristen wants to be a vampire. Edward doesn't want her to be one. Edward wants to get married. Kristen doesn't. She wants to have sex, but Edward doesn't want to have sex out of marriage. (Guess the compromise coming in the next movie?) Dad doesn't want Kristen to date a vampire, but would rather she go out with a werewolf. The movie saga has become overly hokey.It is unfair to say all the acting was bad. Alice Cullen was noticeably good, although she normally appears talking to Kristen. In one scene an excited Alice tells Bella, ""You will be spending the night in our house with Edward."" Bella, whose blank face doesn't even twitch, has a long dramatic Shatner-like pause, and finally remembers her line and says, ""Like, alone?"" It was MST-3000 bad. I had to laugh.Dakota Fanning, who can act, played a very minor role where she wasn't allowed to act, just recite a few lines. The movie reminded me of ""Billy Jack"" where fans of the movie couldn't fathom why the Academy overlooked the movie, or when Star Trek fans couldn't understand why Shatner never got an Emmy. They would say, ""Maybe because William Shatner was so good as Captain Kirk, they didn't realize he was acting."" The same could be said of the Twilight series. We really don't realize these people are acting (except Alice).",3,"I AM HOTTER THAN EDWARD, BUT I STILL CAN'T ACT",1292025600,"12 11, 2010",2010,2699,"['Mousy', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'who', 'species', 'vampires', 'vs.', 'newbie', 'vampires', 'vs.', 'werewolves', 'war', 'perhaps', 'best', 'scene', 'movie', 'lasted', 'two', 'minutes', 'movie', 'filled', 'numerous', 'flashbacks', 'primarily', '19th', 'century', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'series', 'where', 'acting', 'improves', 'one', 'movie', 'next', 'one', 'not', 'wait', 'not', 'bad', 'acting', 'discover', 'newbie', 'vampires', 'are', 'uncontrollable', 'emotional', 'Vampires', 'are', 'uncontrollable', 'must', 'be', 'destroyed', 'only', 'unemotional', 'vampires', 'who', 'simply', 'appear', 'be', 'bad', 'actors', 'survive', 'turn', 'aroma', 'infrequent', 'bathers', 'wig', 'wearers', 'who', 'are', 'also', 'bad', 'actors', 'i.e', 'unemotional', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'unemotional', 'Why', 'werewolves', 'who', 'look', 'underage', 'male', 'revue', 'sucked', 'do', ""n't"", 'know.The', 'most', 'painful', 'scenes', 'are', 'one', 'one', 'dialouge', 'scenes', 'Here', 'unemotional', 'ability', 'out', 'Unfortunately', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'kept', 'yelling', 'screen', 'Get', 'Edward', 'glitter', 'what', 'also', 'unnatural', 'Kristen', 'hairline', 'kept', 'waiting', 'fake', 'hair', 'fall', 'off', 'Young', 'females', 'will', 'certainly', 'rate', '5', 'stars', 'whole', 'unnatural', 'world', 'fighting', 'one', 'one', 'great', 'body', 'personality', 'hygiene', 'Just', 'joke', 'hygiene', 'everything', 'unnatural', 'keeps', 'sniffing', 'scent', 'be', 'vampire', 'Edward', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'one', 'Edward', 'get', 'married', 'Kristen', ""n't"", 'have', 'sex', 'Edward', ""n't"", 'want', 'have', 'sex', 'marriage', 'compromise', 'coming', 'next', 'movie', 'Dad', ""n't"", 'want', 'Kristen', 'date', 'vampire', 'would', 'rather', 'go', 'out', 'werewolf', 'movie', 'saga', 'become', 'overly', 'hokey.It', 'unfair', 'say', 'acting', 'was', 'bad', 'Alice', 'Cullen', 'was', 'noticeably', 'good', 'normally', 'talking', 'Kristen', 'one', 'scene', 'excited', 'Alice', 'tells', 'Bella', 'will', 'be', 'spending', 'night', 'house', 'Edward', 'Bella', 'blank', 'face', ""n't"", 'even', 'twitch', 'long', 'dramatic', 'Shatner-like', 'pause', 'finally', 'remembers', 'line', 'alone', 'was', 'MST-3000', 'bad', 'had', 'laugh.Dakota', 'Fanning', 'who', 'can', 'act', 'played', 'very', 'minor', 'role', 'where', 'was', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'act', 'just', 'recite', 'few', 'lines', 'movie', 'reminded', 'Billy', 'Jack', 'where', 'fans', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'fathom', 'why', 'Academy', 'overlooked', 'movie', 'when', 'Star', 'Trek', 'fans', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'Shatner', 'never', 'got', 'Emmy', 'would', 'say', 'Maybe', 'William', 'Shatner', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'Captain', 'Kirk', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'was', 'acting', 'same', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'Twilight', 'series', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'people', 'are', 'acting', 'Alice']",N/A

After watching two disappointing films, the third just makes me want to dig a hole in the back yard and curl up into a fetal position. I don't seem to see what is good about these films, so I must be going crazy.This film is poorly written, the acting talent is not even there. The worst part is that there are two decent young actresses in this film in Dakota Fanning and Bryce Dallas Howard. Yet, they barley get any screen time in this movie. For a movie that was suppose to give me an incredible epic battle of Vampire vs. Vampire and Ware-wolf...I am left with just a cheap blur of second rate special effects. Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson again horrible and Taylor Lautner is so pathetic in his delivery of dialogue. I mean...""Let's face it...I'm hotter than you???!!!' Someone crank out the crackers because I was just thrown a butt-load of cheese.

I found myself saying wow! as I saw how much work was involved to make this movie.I also enjoy watching the extended and deleted scenes because it gives you an idea of what could have been included but wasn't.What amazes me so much about these Twilight movies is that each one has a different director but the movies continue to just pick up and keep going as if the same person was directing. You also get to hear what the actors think and how they feel about each director.Each special edition also gives the viewer an opportunity to sort of get to know the directors for each movie and to see how much they interacted with the stars and the entire crew.There is an audio commentary with the two stars Robert Pattinson & Kristen Stewart and also an audio commentary with Stephenie Meyer & Wyck Godfrey.The documentary on the making of this movie will keep your eyes glued to the screen.
