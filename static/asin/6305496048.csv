History for the longest time was not necessarily facts, but stories told more for entertainment and or to convey lessons and how to live. The story of Cleopatra has been told many times in different ways for different purposes. This particular movie was based on a novel ""The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel"". It is just as true in its way as Shakespeare's Cleopatra is in its way.One the major advantage of this movie, is that the actors to not overwhelm the characters with their personality. You could not create better actors than the ones that were selected for these parts. Timothy Dalton made a great Caesar and instead of speaking like an orator, he made it seem like a real person actually negotiating an understanding the situation. And who would not fall in love with Leonor Varela as Cleopatra?Depending on whether you are an action person a romantic scene person, the film sometimes seen as like it is dragging and at other times moves at a good pace.

466951,AB34G6VKP28L,6305496048,"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic""","[0, 0]","You would have a hard time distinguishing this Hallmark adaptation from a Hollywood production. It has a gorgeous soundtrack, stellar acting, epic battle scenes... and enough violence and sex to give any modern marvel a run for its money at the box office.Egypt lies torn in its loyalty between the two women who struggle in power for the throne. In the midst of this turmoil, the taxes have not been paid to Rome and Julius Caesar has marched upon the city, to take it captive until new alliances can be formed. The ruler seated upon the throne is a twelve year old boy under the right hand of his older sister Arsinoe; it is she who has kept Cleopatra from taking the empire, despite their father's desire that it be his eldest to succeed him.Caesar cares little who rules the throne... as long as Egypt remains loyal to Rome and pays its annual taxes. Cleopatra has learned of his conquest to take her father's city and devises a scheme to win him to her side. Having herself smuggled into the city, she is deposited literally at the feet of the Roman invaders and asks Caesar to help restore her to her throne. When all else fails, her charms take her into his bedroom, and after one night together he removes Arsinoe from the throne, and gives it to Cleopatra under the condition that she rules with her brother at her side. This safety is short-lived, for her brother has been turned against her... and Arsinoe rouses her armies to attack the palace and drive back the Romans. Caesar is triumphant in his victory, and Cleopatra's reign restored... but she goes against him and has her sister killed in the prison, despite his orders that she remain alive as a bartering tool. She only eludes his fury by flirting with danger, and her leadership becomes etched in stone.Egypt has endured much in the way of civil war and famine. The people are hungry. The taxes are high. The treasuries in danger of depletion. And in Rome, rumor is stirring of Caesar's romantic affair with an Egyptian queen whist he neglects his Roman wife and responsibilities at home. Only his nephew, Octavian, and his loyal Mark Anthony are able to keep Marcus Brutus and his howling pack of wolves at bay. Caesar must return to Rome to defend his position there, just as Cleopatra has learned that she will bear his child. This is her link between the Roman Empire and Egypt... a child, a bartering tool, a sense of security. But Rome is not compassionate to illegitimate children, and divorce is not something spoken of lightly... nor would a romantic alliance be favored. Cleopatra may have won her throne, but she may be forced to fight to keep it. Even then, she cannot protect Caesar in his fight in her favor. And her seductive charms may not work on all the men of the world...I knew going in that Cleopatra was not for the faint of heart. I expected my fair share of implied sex and perhaps some violence... but I was shocked how graphic it was coming from a made-for-television production. I certainly didn't expect to see decapitated heads and mostly naked women! The story demands a certain amount of accuracy, and in most areas Hallmark has gone all out to make ancient Egypt as impressive and majestic as the tombs would have us believe. Rich fabrics, cold stone walls, and draped tapestries provide a rich backdrop for all the mischief that goes on behind closed doors.

466952,A1WJRDNGOCLXHP,6305496048,Charles Harrington,"[3, 5]","Eevry once in a while something in the movie would make me think it was going to turn around.  Sadly this never happened, the film, while very visually satisfying (great sets and costumes earned it a second star) really had nothing to offer in the acting department.  As others have said one of history's greatest femme fatales and seductresses comes off as a whiny floozy.  I can't lay all the blame on Varela though, the writing was just terrible.  Her acting was much better in the second half of the film but it really never came together for me.The greatest injustice was the botched attempt at Antony and Cleopatra's interaction.  Almsot the entire movie is spent with her and Caesar so by the time Antony comes onto the scene there's not enough tim eto make it work.  I had high hopes for this (Billy Zane is a stud) but there wasn't a single moment when you believed that they truly loved each other.  THey just seemed to be using each other (which could have happened but this is one of histories great romances).A couple of other bones to pick.  If the movie had spent any time at all telling us that Cleopatra had some training with weapons I would have been ok with it, sure why not.  And when they had her defending her library desperately with a spear I was ok with that (adrenaline can do so much).  But in the naval battle where she goes into Xena mode, I just don't buy it.  Also when Cleopatra refers to herself as a Goddess and the daughter of Isis, this movie made it seem like she was being arrogant.  But in reality the Pharaohs were gods to the Egyptians and direcc descendants of the immortals.  The movie should have done a bit more to prepare  an audience not familiar with this.",2,It's... just... bad,990489600,"05 22, 2001",2001,1705,"['Eevry', 'once', 'while', 'something', 'movie', 'would', 'make', 'think', 'was', 'going', 'turn', 'around', 'Sadly', 'never', 'happened', 'film', 'very', 'visually', 'satisfying', 'great', 'sets', 'costumes', 'earned', 'second', 'star', 'really', 'had', 'nothing', 'offer', 'acting', 'department', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'one', 'history', 'greatest', 'femme', 'fatales', 'seductresses', 'off', 'whiny', 'floozy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'lay', 'blame', 'Varela', 'writing', 'was', 'just', 'terrible', 'acting', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'really', 'never', 'came', 'together', 'me.The', 'greatest', 'injustice', 'was', 'botched', 'attempt', 'Antony', 'Cleopatra', 'interaction', 'entire', 'movie', 'spent', 'Caesar', 'so', 'time', 'Antony', 'scene', 'not', 'enough', 'tim', 'eto', 'make', 'work', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'stud', 'was', ""n't"", 'single', 'moment', 'when', 'believed', 'truly', 'loved', 'other', 'THey', 'just', 'seemed', 'be', 'using', 'other', 'could', 'have', 'happened', 'one', 'histories', 'great', 'romances', '.A', 'couple', 'other', 'bones', 'pick', 'movie', 'had', 'spent', 'time', 'telling', 'Cleopatra', 'had', 'training', 'weapons', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'ok', 'sure', 'why', 'not', 'when', 'had', 'defending', 'library', 'desperately', 'spear', 'was', 'ok', 'adrenaline', 'can', 'do', 'so', 'much', 'naval', 'battle', 'where', 'Xena', 'mode', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'Also', 'when', 'Cleopatra', 'refers', 'herself', 'Goddess', 'daughter', 'Isis', 'movie', 'made', 'seem', 'was', 'being', 'arrogant', 'reality', 'Pharaohs', 'were', 'gods', 'Egyptians', 'direcc', 'descendants', 'immortals', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'bit', 'more', 'prepare', 'audience', 'not', 'familiar']",N/A
466953,A2TJWNRBBU82FQ,6305496048,Cowboy Buddha,"[2, 2]","Less campy (and less embarrassing) than the famous Liz Taylor epic yet not quite as sexy as the Claudette Colbert version, this Cleopatra is still highly enjoyable - so long as you are not a stickler for historical accuracy. The pace and visual splendor keep you interested as the comic book-style script unfolds. The settings - Morocco for the exteriors, Shepperton in London for the interiors - and well researched costumes offer a never-ending feast for the eyes. Some interesting twists are added to the overly familiar storyline - the inclusion of Cleopatra's sister, for instance. A nice mixture of soap opera and sword & sandal epic to be enjoyed with an open mind and lots of popcorn.The acting is surprisingly good although Billy Zane is a weird choice for Marc Antony. But Timothy Dalton relishes his role as Julius Caesar, tossing off dialogue as if it were Shakespeare and dominating every scene he's in. Equally good is Rupert Graves as Octavius whose multi-layered performance becomes more impressive as the film progresses. Of course, the key role is Cleopatra herself and Leonor Varela takes a pretty good stab at eclipsing memories of Liz. She is certainly the right age and has the prerequisite exotic looks (I will confess to being fascinated by her nipples throughout). Just when you think her acting is running the risk of leaving splinters in her co-stars, she explodes with a sudden dramatic intensity and you begin to believe that this spoiled little girl could be the Queen of Egypt.

Are we supposed to believe that Cleopatra with her small female frame who never lifted a finger to do anything consisting of labor can out dual and kill  trained roman soldiers as what was shown in this movie.. Aside from that the other rediculous portrayal was not correctly pointing out that she had 2-3 kids with Marc Antony. Neither did they accurately portray that Octavian did kill Ceasarian but, instead we are lead to believe that he was given safe passage to india  to one day return as a ruler of egypt and reinstate Cleo's legacy.The main inaccuracy of this movie was to imply cleopatra had egyptian ancestory. The truth is that she was of Greek Ancestory. Her family which included her fathers Ptolemy's lineage were part Alexander the Great's conquest of Egypt. Hence the name of the city of Alexandria where Cleo resided.In spite of this, the movie is entertaining. The wardrobe of the romans and egyptians looks real and the scale of the buildings look authentic..

466956,A35YWA2V4QHOJ3,6305496048,"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[39, 50]","This is an excellent, high budget made-for-TV project which ranks up there with &quot;Odysseus,&quot;  &quot;Merlin,&quot; &quot;Joan Of Arc&quot; and &quot;Jason And The Argonauts&quot; in quality.  In my mind, it is the most well-done film of them all.The movie concentrates on Cleopatra's rise to power as well as her liasons with Julius Caesar and Mark Anthony.  Timothy Dalton, in particular, gives a standout performance as the proud Julius.  The sets are lavish and the film is very panoramic.  Although not too much of the outside of ancient Rome is seen, the set designers did a superb (not to mention expensive) job of re-creating ancient Alexandria.As with most films which try to cover as much ground as &quot;Cleopatra,&quot; there is some fudging of history.  For example, Octavion (later to be known as Caesar Augustus) was NOT in Rome prior to the assasination of his uncle.  It was not until after the assasination that he stepped inside the walls of Rome (he was named by Julius as his chief heir).  The most egregious fudging is a scene in which Octavion is let in on the conspiracy of Brutus &amp; Cassius to assasinate Julius.  I do not think this was necessary and most assuredly is not something Octavion would have allowed to happen, had he been aware of the plot.  Also, in the struggle for power after the death of Julius, there was (for a short time) a triumverate:  Octavion, Mark Anthony (Antonius) and Lepidus.  Lepidus is not mentioned and the film leads one to believe the struggle was only between Octavion and Mark Anthony.It may sound as though I'm being nit-picky and intentionally trying to find fault with this movie.  I am not.  In fact, I can see why they chose to gloss over most of the historical details I mentioned.  First of all, if they had chosen to go for veracity as far as Octavion is concerned, they would have had to have gone one of two ways.  Either they would have had to add another half hour or so to introduce his character, studying in Appollonia, or they would have had to have seemingly made his character appear &quot;out of the blue&quot; after Caesar's murder.  I believe the way they did it was better, for the sake of pragmatism.  After all, this movie is supposed to be about Cleopatra, not Octavion.  Also, Lepidus was a very minor character &amp; quickly dropped out of the triumverate. He was irrelevant to the &quot;scheme of things&quot; insofar as Octavion &amp; Anthony were concerned.  The only issue I take umbrage with is the scene where Octavion is told of the plot to slay Caesar, and does nothing about it.  That not only did not happen, it could not have happened, given the closeness he shared with his uncle.The movie does a wonderful job of making allusions to many historical nuances, such as the Lighthouse of Alexandria (one of the  7 Wonders of the World), the library of Alexandria and the Julian Calendar.  The film contains a very ambitious staging of the Battle of Actium as well.  There is also a wonderful scene in which Mark Anthony holds up the bloodied robes in of Julius at the Caesar's funeral.  That is a historical fact &amp; is what drove the masses into a rage (and also drove Brutus and Cassius out of Rome).This is a very tasteful and well done movie.  I would highly recommend it to all fans and historians of antiquity.  This one is a can't miss.  Also, for those who enjoy this project, I would advocate the BBC production of &quot;I, Claudius&quot; starring Derek Jacoby.

466959,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,6305496048,"""flickjunkie""","[0, 0]","This latest remake of Cleopatra is well done and surprisingly good for a TV movie (now in rental).  I saw it on VHS in its entirety rather than broken down into two  parts in the mini-series.The costumes and sets were very well done, and  true to the period.  The battle scenes were lacking in realism, probably  due to the prospects of a TV audience.  The naval battles looked a little  too much like toy models (which of course they were).  The slave galleys  showing the men rowing the boats were pristine and shiny like the cabin of  some rich yacht, an obvious error.My biggest bewilderment came over the  fact that they shot this movie on video tape.  They tried to make it look  like film in the post production, but it didn't work.  This seems to be  fairly common practice in TV movies, but for a movie of this magnitude,  where they obviously had a big budget for numerous sets, hundreds of  extras, costumes and the like, why shoot it on video tape?  It detracted  from the overall richness of the photography and the movie as a whole.  This is particularly disappointing since the sets and costumes were so  meticulously well done.The directing in this movie was very good.  Franc  Roddam coordinated the movements of large groups of people in very  realistic ways.  The camera work was very good and gave the viewer a lot of  interesting perspectives.  Unfortunately, there were some serious liberties  taken with historical fact.  For instance the film shows Ptolemy to be a  cowering 12 years old when Caesar arrives in 47 BC.  He was actually 19.  It shows Caesar demanding that Cleopatra marry her brother, but she was  married to him long before Caesar arrived in Egypt.  The film shows  Cleopatra having her sister Arsinoe killed and her brother-husband being  killed in pursuit before Caesar left, but neither of those things happened.  As a matter of fact, both were alive and well in 44 BC when Caesar was  murdered.Also, there is no definitive evidence that Cleopatra's son was  fathered by Caesar and certainly no evidence that Caesar publicly declared  such.The biggest perversion of the truth was the death of Mark  Antony.  He did not die from wounds received in a naval battle.  He  committed suicide.  Cleopatra realized that Octavian would defeat Antony  and felt she had to get rid of him for political reasons.  So she had her  servants send word to him that she was dead and in grief he fell on his  sword.The story completely neglects her attempt at trying to seduce  Octavian and his rebuking of her.  It treats their last encounter more like  a business negotiation.  This was not inconsequential since it was one of  the motivations for her suicide.The acting was extremely well done.  First honors go to Timothy Dalton for a powerful rendition of Caesar.  He  was both potent and passionate, just the way one would expect a brilliant  ego maniac like Caesar to be.Billy Zane delivered an excellent  performance of the complex Mark Antony.  I've seen criticism of his  portrayal as being too sniveling with Cleopatra, but in reality he was  utterly submissive to her and despite being a powerful leader, he was her  emotional slave.  He was torn between Rome and his obsession with  Cleopatra, and continually submitted to her will. He carried off the  internal conflict very well.Leonor Varela is a newcomer and a little  rough around the edges.  In certain areas, she was magnificent.  She  captured the cunning seductiveness of Cleopatra, using her siren sexuality  as a weapon to achieve her aims.  She looked stunningly alluring, and her  many translucent robes sometimes made it difficult to concentrate on the  dialogue.  Unfortunately, she tended to overact the emotional parts,  especially rage.  Hopefully, she will improve with experience.I rate  this movie a 7/10.  If it were shot on film I probably would have added at  least a point, maybe two.  It was extremely entertaining and I would  recommend those who missed it on TV to rent or purchase the video.",4,Entertaining look at a legendary figure,955843200,"04 16, 2000",2000,4007,"['latest', 'remake', 'Cleopatra', 'well', 'done', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'TV', 'movie', 'now', 'rental', 'saw', 'VHS', 'entirety', 'rather', 'broken', 'down', 'two', 'parts', 'mini-series.The', 'costumes', 'sets', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'true', 'period', 'battle', 'scenes', 'were', 'lacking', 'realism', 'probably', 'due', 'prospects', 'TV', 'audience', 'naval', 'battles', 'looked', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'toy', 'models', 'course', 'were', 'slave', 'galleys', 'showing', 'men', 'rowing', 'boats', 'were', 'pristine', 'shiny', 'cabin', 'rich', 'yacht', 'obvious', 'error.My', 'biggest', 'bewilderment', 'came', 'fact', 'shot', 'movie', 'video', 'tape', 'tried', 'make', 'look', 'film', 'post', 'production', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'be', 'fairly', 'common', 'practice', 'TV', 'movies', 'movie', 'magnitude', 'where', 'obviously', 'had', 'big', 'budget', 'numerous', 'sets', 'hundreds', 'extras', 'costumes', 'like', 'why', 'shoot', 'video', 'tape', 'detracted', 'overall', 'richness', 'photography', 'movie', 'whole', 'particularly', 'disappointing', 'sets', 'costumes', 'were', 'so', 'meticulously', 'well', 'done.The', 'directing', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'Franc', 'Roddam', 'coordinated', 'movements', 'large', 'groups', 'people', 'very', 'realistic', 'ways', 'camera', 'work', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'gave', 'viewer', 'lot', 'interesting', 'perspectives', 'Unfortunately', 'were', 'serious', 'liberties', 'taken', 'historical', 'fact', 'instance', 'film', 'Ptolemy', 'be', 'cowering', '12', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'Caesar', '47', 'BC', 'was', 'actually', '19', 'Caesar', 'demanding', 'Cleopatra', 'marry', 'brother', 'was', 'married', 'long', 'before', 'Caesar', 'arrived', 'Egypt', 'film', 'Cleopatra', 'having', 'sister', 'Arsinoe', 'killed', 'brother-husband', 'being', 'killed', 'pursuit', 'Caesar', 'left', 'things', 'happened', 'matter', 'fact', 'were', 'alive', 'well', '44', 'BC', 'when', 'Caesar', 'was', 'murdered.Also', 'definitive', 'evidence', 'Cleopatra', 'son', 'was', 'fathered', 'Caesar', 'certainly', 'evidence', 'Caesar', 'publicly', 'declared', 'such.The', 'biggest', 'perversion', 'truth', 'was', 'death', 'Mark', 'Antony', 'did', 'not', 'die', 'wounds', 'received', 'naval', 'battle', 'committed', 'suicide', 'Cleopatra', 'realized', 'Octavian', 'would', 'defeat', 'Antony', 'felt', 'had', 'get', 'rid', 'political', 'reasons', 'had', 'servants', 'send', 'word', 'was', 'dead', 'grief', 'fell', 'sword.The', 'story', 'completely', 'attempt', 'trying', 'seduce', 'Octavian', 'rebuking', 'last', 'encounter', 'more', 'business', 'negotiation', 'was', 'not', 'inconsequential', 'was', 'one', 'motivations', 'suicide.The', 'acting', 'was', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'First', 'honors', 'go', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'powerful', 'rendition', 'Caesar', 'was', 'potent', 'passionate', 'just', 'way', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'brilliant', 'ego', 'maniac', 'Caesar', 'be.Billy', 'Zane', 'delivered', 'excellent', 'performance', 'complex', 'Mark', 'Antony', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'criticism', 'portrayal', 'being', 'too', 'sniveling', 'Cleopatra', 'reality', 'was', 'utterly', 'submissive', 'being', 'powerful', 'leader', 'was', 'emotional', 'slave', 'was', 'torn', 'Rome', 'obsession', 'Cleopatra', 'continually', 'submitted', 'will', 'carried', 'off', 'internal', 'conflict', 'very', 'well.Leonor', 'Varela', 'newcomer', 'little', 'rough', 'edges', 'certain', 'areas', 'was', 'magnificent', 'captured', 'cunning', 'seductiveness', 'Cleopatra', 'using', 'siren', 'sexuality', 'weapon', 'achieve', 'aims', 'looked', 'stunningly', 'alluring', 'many', 'translucent', 'robes', 'sometimes', 'made', 'difficult', 'concentrate', 'dialogue', 'Unfortunately', 'tended', 'overact', 'emotional', 'parts', 'especially', 'rage', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'improve', 'experience.I', 'rate', 'movie', '7/10', 'were', 'shot', 'film', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'least', 'point', 'maybe', 'two', 'was', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'would', 'recommend', 'who', 'missed', 'TV', 'rent', 'purchase', 'video']",N/A
466960,A2VE83MZF98ITY,6305496048,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""","[4, 5]","This production of Cleopatra, intended originally as a miniseries on television, is a reasonably good production with significant differences from the block-buster Hollywood version starring Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton and Rex Harrison.  Cleopatra here is depicted as someone striving to maintain her own position, not necessarily someone with an eye toward world-wide conquest.  Cleopatra is portrayed as an inexperienced person (both sexually and politically) until tutored by the more experienced Romans.  She comes to understand her fate is inextricably intertwined with Caesar, then Antony, but her love for Antony keeps her from making the politically expedient move of giving in to Octavian.  Apparently two Roman rulers are enough for one lifetime.Like the earlier film production, this one plays fast and loose with the actual history, albeit in different ways.  The figure of Octavian/Augustus is far more present earlier here than he was in history; for a production that goes on the greater part of three hours, remarkably little detail about the history is brought forward, and I found that distracting.  The last hour could have easily been recut into a half-hour, and some judicious editing throughout the rest of the film could make it into a much better paced two-hour film.The acting was tolerable but generally unconvincing.  Timothy Dalton as Julius Caesar, Billy Zane (who got top billing) as Marc Antony, and Rupert Graves as Octavian were not up to their usual acting standards in this production.  Dalton was not very expressive, and Zane and Graves were overly so (Graves plays an almost flippant character, not at all in keeping with the historical Augustus).  Ironically, the title character Cleopatra was played by relative newcomer Leonor Varela, who was probably the best actor in the piece.The sets are great, as are the costumes (if not always appropriate - Cleopatra rarely wore Egyptian garb, preferring her more native Greek), and the music is worthwhile.  The battle scenes are pretty typical television fare (with occasional glitches that make these seem more minor skirmishes than great battles).  Unfortunately, the sea-going scenes of ships looked far too obviously fake to suspend disbelief.This is a pleasant diversion, but in the end not a truly memorable production save for bits and pieces here and there.  But it is a good thing that such productions are still being undertaken.",4,Revisioning history,1142467200,"03 16, 2006",2006,2429,"['production', 'Cleopatra', 'intended', 'originally', 'miniseries', 'television', 'reasonably', 'good', 'production', 'significant', 'differences', 'block-buster', 'Hollywood', 'version', 'starring', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'Cleopatra', 'here', 'depicted', 'someone', 'striving', 'maintain', 'own', 'position', 'not', 'necessarily', 'someone', 'eye', 'world-wide', 'conquest', 'Cleopatra', 'portrayed', 'inexperienced', 'person', 'sexually', 'politically', 'tutored', 'more', 'experienced', 'Romans', 'understand', 'fate', 'inextricably', 'intertwined', 'Caesar', 'then', 'Antony', 'love', 'Antony', 'making', 'politically', 'expedient', 'move', 'giving', 'Octavian', 'Apparently', 'two', 'Roman', 'rulers', 'are', 'enough', 'one', 'lifetime.Like', 'earlier', 'film', 'production', 'one', 'fast', 'loose', 'actual', 'history', 'albeit', 'different', 'ways', 'figure', 'Octavian/Augustus', 'far', 'more', 'present', 'earlier', 'here', 'was', 'history', 'production', 'greater', 'part', 'three', 'hours', 'remarkably', 'little', 'detail', 'history', 'brought', 'forward', 'found', 'distracting', 'last', 'hour', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'recut', 'half-hour', 'judicious', 'editing', 'rest', 'film', 'could', 'make', 'much', 'better', 'paced', 'two-hour', 'film.The', 'acting', 'was', 'tolerable', 'generally', 'unconvincing', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'Julius', 'Caesar', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'who', 'got', 'top', 'billing', 'Marc', 'Antony', 'Rupert', 'Graves', 'Octavian', 'were', 'not', 'up', 'usual', 'acting', 'standards', 'production', 'Dalton', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'expressive', 'Zane', 'Graves', 'were', 'overly', 'so', 'Graves', 'almost', 'flippant', 'character', 'not', 'keeping', 'historical', 'Augustus', 'Ironically', 'title', 'character', 'Cleopatra', 'was', 'played', 'relative', 'newcomer', 'Leonor', 'Varela', 'who', 'was', 'probably', 'best', 'actor', 'piece.The', 'sets', 'are', 'great', 'are', 'costumes', 'not', 'always', 'appropriate', 'Cleopatra', 'rarely', 'wore', 'Egyptian', 'garb', 'preferring', 'more', 'native', 'Greek', 'music', 'worthwhile', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'pretty', 'typical', 'television', 'fare', 'occasional', 'glitches', 'make', 'seem', 'more', 'minor', 'skirmishes', 'great', 'battles', 'Unfortunately', 'sea-going', 'scenes', 'ships', 'looked', 'far', 'too', 'obviously', 'fake', 'suspend', 'disbelief.This', 'pleasant', 'diversion', 'end', 'not', 'truly', 'memorable', 'production', 'save', 'bits', 'pieces', 'here', 'there', 'good', 'thing', 'such', 'productions', 'are', 'still', 'being', 'undertaken']",N/A

This movie is not less historically accurate that Shakespeare's Julius Caesar or Anthony and Cleopatra.The fact is that it is a thrilling drama, with steamy romance, gripping action and intrigue.It is probably true from the evidence that Cleopatra was not an extremely beautiful woman, which leads some to fault the casting of the gorgeous Leonora Varela.But it is totally unfair to fault Leonora as an actress. She is a fantastic actress, and it is great to watch her Cleopatra. Indeed, who could not fall in love with Leonora Varela's Cleopatra? So what if she is not Elizabeth Taylor (she is rather more beautiful than Elizabeth Taylor)The truth is that Cleopatra in reality was, no doubt, an unscrupulous, and scheming woman, and if anything the casting of the lovely Leonora, in her very sensually charged portrayal of this role, makes me more sympathetic to her character.I hope to see much more of Leonora, she'd make a great Osnat, the wife of the Yosef, the Hebrew who rose to become Prince of Egypt, Queen Esther of the Purim story, or Pocahontas.Timothy Dalton as always, was his grand self and added the required force to the role of Julius Caesar, and Billy Zane knew how to do a great Mark Anthony.I thought some particularly memorable scenes are where Cleopatra shows some skill with weapons in defending herself from would-be-assassins, the portrayal of the Roman Senate,  the rally after Caesar's assasination where Mark Anthony swears revenge against Caesar's murderers and enflames the crowd against Brutus , Cassius and company , and the recreation of Alexandria.Octavian is well displayed as a scheming, power-player, and whoever had the idea of him presenting Brutus' head to Mark Anthony in a basket.And a nice role played by Kassandra Voyagis as Cleopatra's short lived sister Arsinoe.

But now I finally have the DVD, so this is an updated review.Franc Roddam's 1999 telefilm ""CLEOPATRA"" isn't so much a remake of the classic 1963 epic film starring Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton and Rex Harrison. Though I enjoy the 3 hour 22 minute spectacle, I think that this version is the DEFINITIVE version of the story, though there are some historical errors (which I won't attempt to discuss; if you want history, you'd better stick with the 1963 movie, as it used the Roman historians Gaius Suetonius Tranquilus, Plutarch, Appian and other ancient sources as the basis for the screenplay). Too bad the producers decided to make it as a straight-to-video film. It was made for $14 million less than the 1963 movie, which really avoided what befell the earlier film during production. But it could have had a bigger budget from a studio other than 20th Century Fox. The acting, especially from the three leads (Billy Zane as Marc Antony, Timothy Dalton as Julius Caesar and newcomer Leonor Varela as Cleopatra) is strong. I've seen the two male leads in other films, so I knew this one would be worth viewing. Ms. Varela is drop-dead gorgeous. This film is Not Rated.The DVD of this movie features 38 minutes of footage inexplicably cut from the VHS version of the film, and it makes a good movie even so much better. The scenes add a lot to the movie, explaining several sequences that appear out of the blue in the VHS (these scenes include: additional dialogue after Cleopatra's initial introduction, an extended scene of Caesar discussing his plan of battle against Ptolemy and Arsinoe's army, an extended scene of Caesar explaining to Cleopatra that he had a daughter named Julia who died, Marc Antony showing Cleopatra into Caesar's villa in Rome and telling her that Caesar has arranged a welcome for her before his victory parade, Caesar visiting Cleopatra at his villa in Rome and Cleopatra showing him their son and Caesar makes Cleopatra promise to keep Caesarion a secret, Caesar introducing Cleopatra to Calpurnia, Octavian, Octavia and Marcus Brutus, Cassius' suicide is shown rather than implied, after the battle of Actium, Cleopatra instructs a commander [Oded Fehr] to put their victory colours on her barge and organize a victory celebration in Alexandria, etc). The scenes mentioned above, and other additional scenes, make for a cohesive narrative on DVD than on VHS.

I know there are sexy scenes there but frankly I feel the scene with Dalton/Varela in their first intimate encounter was extremely sensual.  I don't know how these people move so slowly and project such intense interest in each other.  But I like it!!  I just happen to enjoy more seductive behavior than the ""pounce"" and make love approach.

The other mini-series were fantasy-based so unrealistic dialog worked just fine in them but this one was full of overly theatrical and unrealistic assertions which not only ruined the story by robbing it of any depth but also made it very difficult for the actors to perform well. After all, it's hard to credibly deliver one sweeping statement after another with little in between to connect those statements or build relationships to the point where they make sense.I think the writers (perhaps properly) assumed viewers were familiar with the basic characters so they just skipped character development and went straight to having the characters speak in a macro fashion. This was a mistake and the entire miniseries suffers for it.Timothy Dalton seems to give it his all despite poor material and Billy Zane either by virtue of his character or adequate acting chops does alright. Leonor Varela, unfortunately, is simply not up to the task of playing Cleopatra as she deserves to be portrayed. While waiting for Caesar, she seems to be waiting anxiously for her prom date to show up. In her scenes with Dalton, she seems to be acting in love rather than coming across as actually in love with him.

Tough, Hard, War like but diplomatic and fair stratigic witty and powerful, just like the Romans in history were who achieved greatness. Billy Zane plays a near perfect Mark Anthony who was truely loyal to Ceaser till the death, but was afriad to walk in His shoes of greatness knowing he was only just a man, not Ceaser Himself.Plus, both got to have make out scenes with Leonor Varela which makes them Both pretty lucky in their own right &#62;:)~Leonor Varela Plays a supurb Cleopatra who is cunning, coniving, and plotting, and also very very crafty with many resources which she uses on film with good talent.The Hallmark version does an excellent job with entertaining but also teaching a story behind it all, not to mention one of the best old Roman Battle scences with Timothy Dalton defending Egypt. The first time I watched that I had to reverse My dvd a few times just to watch it over again, the battles were awsome =)I just only wish Hallmark Classic would have a movie/story/documentry as such all dedicated exclusivly about Constantinople but who knows?

Leonor Varela was beautiful and convincing as Cleopatra. And I loved both Billy Zane and Timothy Dalton as the two leading men. It is dramatic and sensual and exciting.

The 1999 version makes up for this shortcoming as it combines action & adventure with the expected melodrama.A few memorable highlights are as follows:-- Timothy Dalton is outstanding as Julius Caesar and has an undeniable commanding presence. That distinguishing cleft chin of his somehow fits the role just perfect.-- Billy Zane is also great as Marc Antony. He played the psycho killer in ""Dead Calm"" and the love-to-hate villain in ""Titanic,"" but his character in ""Cleopatra"" is the express opposite. As Marc Antony, Zane is both likable and heroic, not to mention loyal and realistically human.-- There are some great Moroccan locations for the outdoor scenes. The indoor & city sets are good and have that distinctive Egyptian vibe; the costuming as well.-- The multifaceted score isn't overly bombastic but it is fitting, properly edited and memorable.As for Leonor Varela, the actress who plays Cleopatra, she has the requisite exotic looks for the part, but she's too bland. She's undeniably good-looking, but she's not my cup of tea (too thin), so all that leaves (for me) is her performance, which is merely adequate. However, I'll say this: She's more fitting for the role than Elizabeth Taylor!The '63 version failed to pull me into its story; this '99 version pulls you right in and is easy to follow. I'm not saying that it's the most captivating piece of cinema, but it's certainly better than the '63 rendition.WARNING: The run time of the film is 177 minutes and the DVD 155 minutes, but the VHS version runs only 139 minutes, cutting 38 minutes from the original!GRADE: C+ or B-",4,Way better than the '63 Version,1133568000,"12 3, 2005",2005,1754,"['tried', 'watching', '1963', 'version', 'Cleopatra', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'gave', 'up', '90', 'adventure-less', 'minutes', 'boring', 'dialogue', '1999', 'version', 'up', 'shortcoming', 'action', 'adventure', 'expected', 'melodrama.A', 'few', 'memorable', 'highlights', 'are', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'outstanding', 'Julius', 'Caesar', 'undeniable', 'commanding', 'presence', 'distinguishing', 'cleft', 'chin', 'somehow', 'role', 'just', 'perfect.', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'also', 'great', 'Marc', 'Antony', 'played', 'psycho', 'killer', 'Dead', 'Calm', 'love-to-hate', 'villain', 'Titanic', 'character', 'Cleopatra', 'express', 'opposite', 'Marc', 'Antony', 'Zane', 'likable', 'heroic', 'not', 'mention', 'loyal', 'realistically', 'human.', 'are', 'great', 'Moroccan', 'locations', 'outdoor', 'scenes', 'indoor', 'city', 'sets', 'are', 'good', 'have', 'distinctive', 'Egyptian', 'vibe', 'costuming', 'well.', 'multifaceted', 'score', ""n't"", 'overly', 'bombastic', 'fitting', 'properly', 'edited', 'memorable.As', 'Leonor', 'Varela', 'actress', 'who', 'Cleopatra', 'requisite', 'exotic', 'looks', 'part', 'too', 'bland', 'undeniably', 'good-looking', 'not', 'cup', 'tea', 'too', 'thin', 'so', 'performance', 'merely', 'adequate', 'However', ""'ll"", 'say', 'more', 'fitting', 'role', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', ""'63"", 'version', 'failed', 'pull', 'story', 'version', 'pulls', 'right', 'easy', 'follow', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'most', 'captivating', 'piece', 'cinema', 'certainly', 'better', ""'63"", 'rendition.WARNING', 'run', 'time', 'film', '177', 'minutes', 'DVD', '155', 'minutes', 'VHS', 'version', 'only', '139', 'minutes', 'cutting', '38', 'minutes', 'original', 'GRADE', 'C+', 'B-']",N/A
