The writers knew about Star Trek as much as Dr McCoy knew about klingon anatomy.First off...Archer.....where did they get Archer? Star Trek the Animated in 1973 in a episode said April was the very first Enterprise capt. I mean WTF!!!!!!!  How can you totaly, completely ignore a existing story and history line?Then, the episode where they came up with the ""non interference"" was a joke! You had a race dying from a disease and they withheld the medicine saying nature outta just take its cource and we shouldnt interfere, laughable. So Kirk never should have gotten the Ritallen in the episode ""Requruim for Methesula"" or they should just have let the klingons die out when paxis blew up. Whatever. The show was a mess. The only thing good about this series was the final 3 episodes where they were in a Alternate Universe, had they satrted with that, it wouda been a classic, instead it's just rubbish.This show could have been so great but I really think the writing and just the look and feel and show stunk. The writing was so lame that they had to make a continuing boring story line of the Zindi.Fans hated the show and thus was cancelled 4 years early than projected.Oh well.",1,Welcome to the series that totaly RUINED the Star Trek Canon,1274054400,"05 17, 2010",2010,1267,"['First', 'am', 'HUGE', 'Star', 'Trek', 'fan', 'always', 'have', 'been', 'series', 'was', 'Joke', 'writers', 'knew', 'Star', 'Trek', 'as', 'much', 'Dr', 'McCoy', 'knew', 'klingon', 'anatomy.First', 'Archer', '..where', 'did', 'get', 'Archer', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Animated', '1973', 'episode', 'said', 'April', 'was', 'very', 'first', 'Enterprise', 'capt', 'mean', 'WTF', 'How', 'can', 'totaly', 'completely', 'ignore', 'existing', 'story', 'history', 'line', 'Then', 'episode', 'where', 'came', 'up', 'non', 'interference', 'was', 'joke', 'had', 'race', 'dying', 'disease', 'withheld', 'medicine', 'saying', 'nature', 'outta', 'just', 'take', 'cource', 'shouldnt', 'interfere', 'laughable', 'So', 'Kirk', 'never', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'Ritallen', 'episode', 'Requruim', 'Methesula', 'should', 'just', 'have', 'let', 'klingons', 'die', 'out', 'when', 'paxis', 'blew', 'up', 'show', 'was', 'mess', 'only', 'thing', 'good', 'series', 'was', 'final', '3', 'episodes', 'where', 'were', 'Alternate', 'Universe', 'had', 'satrted', 'wouda', 'been', 'classic', 'instead', 'just', 'rubbish.This', 'show', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'great', 'really', 'think', 'writing', 'just', 'look', 'feel', 'show', 'stunk', 'writing', 'was', 'so', 'lame', 'had', 'make', 'continuing', 'boring', 'story', 'line', 'Zindi.Fans', 'hated', 'show', 'thus', 'was', 'cancelled', '4', 'years', 'early', 'projected.Oh', 'well']",N/A

If you do not enjoy star trek, why are you looking at this item? I kid I kid.This is probably my favorite ST series of all time, a series that was cut down in its prime. This fact leads to a bit of a hurried ending for the series and I feel that the final episode could have gone a much better way...however do not let this influence your decision on this series. It is phenomenol...it has all of the classical ST elements of social commentary and the exploration of not only space but humanity as well.The series also has this wonderful feel of being a pioneer. The other ST series already have the federation behind them and a huge fleet of ships...but in this show there is only Earth with one deep space exploration ship and they are pretty much on their own (except the Vulcans...bleh).

This is ""New Fronteir"" as stated by Kirk himself.  Enterprise(as in the seires Archer) is a lackluster attempt for nostalgia without even knowing what the true concept is about!  The crew is too comfortable, and worried more about how ""irritating"" the smell of human is to vulcan females, rather than how dangerous space travel can be.  Thier is no sense of anxiety as in the kirk series.  It does not feel as it took place before; but after.  I am infiriated to the point of rage by one season in particular as it reflects 9/11 in a macho attempt to appease our war-hungery audiance.  T'Pau(or whatever you spell it) is much of the time out of character for a vulcan.  More than the music, most of these characters are sappy(particuallarly the male characters) and unfriendly.  They have no respect for one another, and are not inspiring at all.  I don't feel I could care weather they lived or died.  I always routed for Spock, McCoy and Kirk(and crew) but not with the Archer Club.(as in Culture Club).

929599,A2CJRAZ5JCSTZC,B000AOEMXM,BPNoble,"[4, 4]","When I heard that this series was being added to the Star Trek universe, I was thrilled -- ""Oh, boy!"" I thought, ""It's going to be exciting to have a back story to TOS!""I sat down and watched it.  Got the idea that the producers were trying to take first achievements away from Kirk, but, okay.  I could live with some of that, although when they introduced the time war I found it a little hard to swallow.  Then came the third season -- the Zindi season.  Over half of it was devoted to preventing Earth from being destroyed.  BORRRRRINNNNGGG!  Where were the stories of exploration?  The new species to meet?  The friendly, gentle captain that I had grown to like?  Suddenly, Archer's personality changed, people that I liked died (unnecessarily if it wasn't for the Zindi).  I got tired of the of the long-winded Zindi story line -- and that, plus, what I thought were Berman, et al.'s desire to change the rules precedences that had begun in the original series (and, to a certain degree it was since it was based on Michael Okuda's rewrite of Star Trek history, which seems to ignore TOS), and I stopped watching it. I never saw the last season. Too bad for me and the rest of the viewers who gave up.Well, it was on SyFy now for about two plus go-rounds, and still shows up occasionally.  I've watched the entire series twice and a little more, and since I can't work and have lots of time to fill -- I became a junkie and watched 3 episodes a day (and no one come to the conclusion that I'm a bit balmy -- that's a given).And, I have found out that there weren't any changes that took away from the start of the TOS, etc. cycle, but set some things up -- explained why Klingons looked different on TOS and in the movies and later; other things that I can't remember right now to list.In short, I've come to love it. I'm still not too happy about the Zindi thing and the temporal time war, but I have found that it does serve as a wonderful prelude to the rest of the Star Trek universe.  Now, of course, Scott Bakula is a big part of my love for it, but the other regulars came into the series fully-fleshed out and grew as the series continued.  The stories, for the most part, are well-told and leave me with a feeling that I've not wasted my time watching it.If you can, watch a few episodes.  Then, turn around, save your money, and buy the series.  My copy lives right next door to my collections of the first 2-episode at a time release ($1,400 worth) as well as the Blu-ray version that is coming out) of TOS.I will always, first and foremost, love TOS the best -- I was 15 when it came out, and it gave me a great many aspirations.

929600,A2H8NP7I9LF6O8,B000AOEMXM,BruceK,"[4, 5]","Way back in the 60's there was a show called ""Star Trek"". I was a kid then and it had a great affect on my life and on many others as well. Movies, cartoons, books sprouted up after the show was abruptly and obviously wrongly cancelled ... probably for being too subversive and intelligent. As good as I remember it to be as a child, the original series is dated and simple. Originally it was billed as an adult science fiction drama if I recall right but it is almost unwatchable anymore because it is so simple and slow moving and single-threaded.  Still, I am sentiment, just realistic about that original series.My affection for Star Trek had me going to movies and eventually watching spin-off series, one after the other, until I just lost interest as it got to be too commercial. Most of the Next Generation shows were too staid and politically correct for me, dry and preachy and too campy. There was one excellent episode I think was entitled ""The Flute"" that stood the test of time. But I lost interest and stopped caring about Star Trek after a while. Then came ""Deep Space Nine"", ""Voyager"", and finally ""Enterprise"". By the time ""Enterprise"" came along I considered it commerical ""kid stuff.""  When the ""Star Trek"" movie reboot showed up it was great eye candy, but it just made me mad it was so far from the original vision of Gene Roddenberry and so brain dead and just stupid.Well ... thank to streaming video NetFlix and Amazon I have had the chance without a major investment in time and money to sample ""Enterprise"". The first episodes of the first season were pretty much what I expected and more or less the same predictable formula of the franchise. But a funny thing happened over time as I watched the episodes develop, the show got into a pace, and it was more raw, more honest, less politically correct, less preachy, and by the second season - it was damn good.The first season is good, but I almost did not keep up watching it. Something happened in the second season, particularly with the episode ""Cogenitor"" that showed me the series had writers that were not afraid to dive into tough issues, with thoughtful and excellent writing.""Enterprise"" is excellent. Certainly it will never have the same effect on me that the original series had as a kid, but I think it is better than the original series, though not quite as comedic, it meets the criterion of an adult science fiction drama. It's really good, and congratulations to the actors, effects makers, writers and directors for doing a f-ing excellent job of bringing Star Trek back to life. The whole cast is great and the stories are much fun yet the stories as serious and human but still do not take themselves too seriously. Just a wonderful experience to se this ... and my only regret is that I did not give it a chance and add to ""Enterprise's"" ratings when it was on.

One of the better ones it turned out. I think of all the series the original, DS-9, and Enterprise are probably the best when it comes to replayability. I never seem to tire of rewatching them. The timeline is before the original but obviously we have come along way in special effects so this will seem far less cheesy than the original in the props department. I recommend this series for the whole family. A number of issues are covered that it would do a family good to discuss, just like the original series. The DVD quality is good, the boxes are cheap, and the Paramount price is outragious as usual. When they hit around fifty a season I will buy them, afterall about every other TV series on the planet is in that range.

929608,A34IBXM7E8CPWE,B000AOEMXM,David Girod,"[3, 3]","""Star Trek: Enterprise"" is actually a much better show than you've been led to believe. There are a lot of things ""Enterprise"" does right, unfortunately there are quite a few mis-steps as well.Let's get this out of the way first:The Bad:The Writing - The stories, specifically the 1st and 2nd SeasonS, the writing is very uneven and at times dull. The episodes dealing with time travel in particular are pretty tepid at best. Unfortunately, the time travel ""Temporal Cold War"" episodes dominate the first two seasons, and while some are better than others, for the most part I preferred the stand alone episodes much more.Scott Bakula - I like Scott Bakula...as Sam Beckett in ""Quantum Leap"" or as Terry in the recently cancelled ""Men of a Certain Age"". Bakula did a great job in both of those roles by simply being Scott Bakula. Watching ""Enterprise"" you see Scott Bakula in a Star Fleet uniform, but he never really becomes the character. He acts exactly the same as he did in ""Quantum Leap"" and you don't buy him as a Star Fleet Captain. For one, he's too nice. Captain Archer does some pretty nasty things throughout this series, but you never buy Bakula's Captain doing them. I could see Shatner's Kirk forcing a clone to an early death so it's stem cells can be harvested, or Picard taking an alien ship's warp core to save his own ship, but by doing so he's basically stranding the aliens 3 years from  home...but not Archer. And that is because we never really meet Archer, we see Scott Bakula instead. If an unknown had been cast in the roll, then I think Archer would've developed into one of the most memorable characters the whole Trek Universe.""Faith of the Heart"" - I'm sorry, of all this mis-steps this show takes, the opening theme may be the worst. The soft-rock theme is horrible, like the b-side of a Michael Bolton song released in 1993. It dates the show, and you really miss the sweeping, epic instrumentals that open the Trek shows.There are some other mis-steps, but those 3 are the main faults I found with the show overall.Now with that said, there are plenty of reasons the make ""Enterprise"" well worth adding to your collection.The Good Stuff:The Xindi Storyline - ""Enterprise"" really hits its stride at the very end of Season 2 (and throughout the rest of it's run) when an alien probe attacks Earth. Season 3 features some of the best episodes not only of ""Enterprise"" but in all of ""Star Trek"". There are some genuine nail-biter episodes, some truly funny shows, some great episodes that will tug at your heart, and even a terrificly scary episode featuring ""zombie"" Vulcans. Excellent story-telling, great visual effects, a season long story that never lets up. Season 3 takes everything we've learned in Seasons 1 & 2, build on it, develops the characters so that we really care about them, and the show begins firing on all cylinders.The Rest of the Crew - Okay, so I wasn't sold on Scott Bakula as Captain Archer, well the rest of the cast more than makes up for it. While character development is pretty slow for the first season or two (with the exception of Doctor Phlox and the focus on Captain Archer), the secondary character really shine in season two, three and four. Connor Trinneer as ""Trip"" Tucker and Jolene Blalock as the Vulcan T'Pol, really come into their own with the second season forward, really creating great characters. The characters of Malcolm Reed, Hoshi Sato and Travis Mayweather, while not as developed as the four ""main"" characters, each get a chance to shine as well. By the end of the fourth and final season, you really come to care for this crew.The Gimmick Episodes - One of my favorite things about ""Enterprise"" was that the writers had to come up with creative ways to toss in a gimmick episode. Instead of just sending the crew to the ""holodeck"" (which was way over-used in other Trek series), the ""Enterprise"" crew got put into some crazy situations. Vulcans in 1950's Pennsylvania, the aforementioned ""Zombie Vulcan"" episode, imaginitive episodes involving the Borg and several involving Augments as well, a couple of great ""Mirror Universe"" episodes and the fantastic finale.Guest Stars - I love the occasional characters that populate Trek shows, like John de Lancie as ""Q"" in TNG. ""Enterprise"" has some of the most memorable, the Andorian Commander Schran played by Jeffrey Combs is fantastic! Watching as his character evolves over all four seasons was a real treat, and he seems to be involved in most of my favorite episodes. Gary Graham as Vulcan Ambassador Soval is pitch perfect as Archer's main Vulcan foil. And what fan didn't love when Brent Spiner guest starred as Dr. Arik Soong over several episodes in the final season?I fully understand why ""Enterprise"" is either loved or hated by most fans. Lets face it, ""Enterprise"" is a show for the established Trek fan, it's not a show designed to bring in the casual viewer or to open up the Trek universe to a wider audience with all of the references to previous Trek shows and movies. I actually think ""Enterprise' was ahead of it's time, in that most Trek fans were innundated with Trek product at the time. We had some version of ""Star Trek"" on tv for over two decades when ""Enterprise"" came on, ""The Next Generation"" feature films were still going strong (who knew ""Nemesis"" would make the end of the film series in 2002?) and when ""Enterprise"" sort of stumbled coming out of the gate, fans lost patience pretty quickly.I do recommend Trek fans give this show another shot. No, it's not perfect, and yes, there are some pretty bad shows here and there (but go back and try top watch the first 2 season of TNG sometime!!), but overall, it's a really good show, and deserves another look.",4,Solid Show with a Bad Rep,1318464000,"10 13, 2011",2011,5724,"['Star', 'Trek', 'Enterprise', 'actually', 'much', 'better', 'show', ""'ve"", 'been', 'led', 'believe', 'are', 'lot',

929609,AZDVOFC2MTIM5,B000AOEMXM,DEAN M. Dent,"[124, 151]","On September of 2001,the UPN network and Star Trek producer Rick Berman with writer/producer Brannon Braga introduced viewers to Enterprise (later renamed Star Trek Enterprise in season three).This fifth live action series from the franchise took place a century before James T. Kirk's five year voyage of the original series.This series follows the pioneering voyage of the first warp five ship in the early days of Starfleet, before the formation of the United Federation of Planets.The crew of the NX-01 led by Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula), consisted of the Vulcan liason/first officer T'Pol (Jolene Blalock), Chief Engineer Charles ""Trip"" Tucker III (The great Connor Trennier), British armory officer Malcolm Reed (Dominic Keating),Communication Officer/ linguist Hoshi Sato (Linda Park), Helmsman Travis Mayweather (Anthony Montgomery), and Denoblian Chief Medical Officer Phlox (John Billingsly).The show had the distinction of being the series that ruined an almost forty year old franchise.But in the end it's only crime was bad timing, the creators total disregard to continuity,as well as wasting time putting around the galaxy, and focusing on the confusing Temporal Cold War while fans wanted to see the early days of Starfleet leading up to the founding of the United Federation of Planets.At first the series was sampled by Trekkers curious about the beginnings of the Federation,which wasn't adressed until the fourth and final season.Viewership dwindled by it's racy tone, disregard of continuity, the fact that NX-01 looked technologically advanced to Kirk's NCC-1701,the unnessesary ""Temporal Cold War"" and it's theme song which was a AOR pop song(!!!!).The stories felt prefunctuary as to appeal to a larger audience, which was the previous Star Trek Voyager's biggest flaw.Aside from the shows fallabilities, the first season boasted great episodes in Broken Bow (the series pilot), The Andorian Incident, Breaking the Ice, Cold Front, Dear Doctor, Shuttlepod One, and Shockwave (the season finale cliffhanger).By the time of the second season, it was pretty obvious that Enterprise was a disappointment to viewers who felt the show direction was weak as well as ""Franchise Trek"" becoming stale (indicated by 2002's Star Trek Nemesis's poor box office performance). After the follow-up to the excellent first season finale (Shockwave pt II),the season consisted of weak episodes(Precious Cargo, Canamar,The Crossing,Horizon, and the terrible A Night in Sickbay),among some of it's finest(Carbon Creek, Minefield, Stigma, Future Tense,Judgment,Cogenitor, Regeneration, and the best Enterprise episodes ever,Dead Stop ).Fans who first tuned in to see how the steps were taken for the UFP to be formed(which would be touched upon during the last episodes of the fourth and final season) had to contend with two seasons worth of ""Boldly Going Nowhere.Sensing a change in direction was needed, the show took on a different course as Enterprise respond to an attack on earth (""The Expanse"", an allusions to 9-11), and try to stop the Xindi race from developing a weapon of mass destruction.This story arc continued into the third season,as Archer's new mission of stopping the Xindi from destroying Earth with a superweapon.Albiet,there were some weak semi stand alone episodes (Extinction,North Star,Carpenter St.,and E2),among classic episodes which ranks with some of the franchises best(Impulse,Twilight,Azati Prime/Damage,The Counsel/Countdown/Zero Time).Staff member Manny Coto was responsible for new direction which made for the most exciting season of the entire four year run.Unfortunatly the exciting new direction couldn't produce ratings and was barely renewed after a fan based letter writing campaign,echoing the classic series fan fueled renewal.The fourth season of Star Trek Enterprise was the season that most Trekkers have been waiting for, with homages to the original series(Mirror Universe,The Eugenics Wars,Orion slave women,T'Pau), as well as rectifying continuety errors(The Vulcans,The Klingon ""forehead"" issue).Unfortunately,the show was cancelled prematurely as the show was becoming what Trekkers been waiting for since ""Broken Bow"".Sensing that the show wasn't going to see a fifth season,Executive producer Berman handed the reins to Coto, who set about in correcting the many elements in Trek history that have been disregarded,which driven away even the most dedicated fan.The season's format was tweaked to make room for multi episode arcs which dealt separately with The Eugenics Wars(The Augment trilogy featuring Brent Spiner as Arik Soong),A Vulcan Civil War(featuring Surak, and T'Pau),A Klingon Virus (resulting in the humanoid Klingon foreheads from the original series), and the mirror universe featuring the USS Defiant from The Tholian Web.One of the biggest disappointments of the season itself was the final episode ""..These Are The Voyages"" which takes place on the Enterprise-D, featuring Riker and Troi reviewing the NX-01's final mission before the charter signing of the UFP.Instead of giving the NX-01 crew a dignified send off,they were used as supporting characters in a glorified ""Next Generation"" episode.Unfortunately,Enterprise would be a troubled production whereas the declining interest of Trek, flawed stories of the earlier seasons, and bad ratings would lead to it's cancellation.The finale (written by Rick Berman and Brannon Braga) was called a ""Valentine to the fans"".But the real valentine was the entire fourth season which finally gave the fans what they wanted,and the most problematic Star Trek series a dignified ending, dispite it's weak finale.Top five episodes1.Dead Stop (season two)2.Impulse (Season Three)3.Dear Doctor (Season one)4.Cogenetor (Season Two)5.Damage(Season Three)",4,ST-Enterprise  It's Four Year

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 2]","ENTERPRISE (a/k/a, wrongly, STAR TREK: ENTERPRISE) virtually speaks for itself, and it seems to have dyspraxia (no, not a moon near Chronos, I mean the physical manifestation of dyslexia). Though it was extremely promising and highly disappointing, any and every ""Star Trek"" fan salivated over this thing for many a long year.Here you have it, all four lousy seasons of it. I don't hide my extreme love for this show, for Scott Bakula and all the rest - nor do I hide my utter disdain for Rick Berman and Brannon Braga, who were the true destroyers of this Star Trek dream in my opinion.The opportunity of a lifetime: to show an honest-to-goodness prequel of the very universe of the Star Trek we all know, the first spaceship Enterprise (because it had to EARN the name of ""starship"", you see). All that wasted, wasted, wasted art and talent. Particularly offensive to me was the series' attempt to steal bits of Diane Duane's ""Star Trek Bible"", one of my favorite books,Spock's World(see my review). They did this by making Vulcans the angriest little piss-ants in the universe.The series started out well. Bakula was cheerful (by the end of the 2nd season he was acting like grandpa on a bad prostate day). The adventures were as fun as the original series, and the Enterprise was ready for anything. Yet the rumored openly gay character never materialized, and Berman as well as Braga told the press several other lies about the series. One big one was they swore they'd never reference the original series because, well, they couldn't. Yet somehow, they did it anyway.The stupid story arcs that spanned more than one season did not help. The Xindi trying to destroy Earth (well, they nailed Florida anyway); the temporal agents in their cold war who kept dragging Captain Archer into their schemes without telling the audience why it had to be him. What was worse than anything, in my view, is the series actually began as politically relevant. Remember the Suliban? Sound like TALIBAN to anyone? What lost opportunities.Well, get it if you like - I wouldn't mind a used set in like-new shape.",3,"Wax on, wax off",1373328000,"07 9, 2013",2013,2098,"['ENTERPRISE', 'a/k/a', 'wrongly', 'STAR', 'TREK', 'ENTERPRISE', 'virtually', 'have', 'dyspraxia', 'not', 'moon', 'Chronos', 'mean', 'physical', 'manifestation', 'dyslexia', 'was', 'extremely', 'promising', 'highly', 'disappointing', 'Star', 'Trek', 'fan', 'salivated', 'thing', 'many', 'long', 'year.Here', 'have', 'four', 'lousy', 'seasons', 'do', ""n't"", 'hide', 'extreme', 'love', 'show', 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'rest', 'do', 'hide', 'utter', 'disdain', 'Rick', 'Berman', 'Brannon', 'Braga', 'who', 'were', 'true', 'destroyers', 'Star', 'Trek', 'dream', 'opinion.The', 'opportunity', 'lifetime', 'show', 'honest-to-goodness', 'prequel', 'very', 'universe', 'Star', 'Trek', 'know', 'first', 'spaceship', 'Enterprise', 'had', 'EARN', 'name', 'starship', 'see', 'wasted', 'wasted', 'wasted', 'art', 'talent', 'Particularly', 'offensive', 'was', 'series', 'attempt', 'steal', 'bits', 'Diane', 'Duane', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Bible', 'one', 'favorite', 'books', 'Spock', 'World', 'see', 'review', 'did', 'making', 'Vulcans', 'angriest', 'little', 'piss-ants', 'universe.The', 'series', 'started', 'out', 'well', 'Bakula', 'was', 'cheerful', 'end', '2nd', 'season', 'was', 'acting', 'grandpa', 'bad', 'prostate', 'day', 'adventures', 'were', 'as', 'fun', 'original', 'series', 'Enterprise', 'was', 'ready', 'anything', 'rumored', 'openly', 'gay', 'character', 'never', 'materialized', 'Berman', 'as', 'well', 'Braga', 'told', 'press', 'several', 'other', 'lies', 'series', 'One', 'big', 'one', 'was', 'swore', ""'d"", 'never', 'reference', 'original', 'series', 'well', 'could', ""n't"", 'somehow', 'did', 'anyway.The', 'stupid', 'story', 'arcs', 'spanned', 'more', 'one', 'season', 'did', 'not', 'help', 'Xindi', 'trying', 'destroy', 'Earth', 'well', 'nailed', 'Florida', 'anyway', 'temporal', 'agents', 'cold', 'war', 'who', 'kept', 'dragging', 'Captain', 'Archer', 'schemes', 'telling', 'audience', 'why', 'had', 'be', 'What', 'was', 'worse', 'anything', 'view', 'series', 'actually', 'began', 'politically', 'relevant', 'Remember', 'Suliban', 'Sound', 'TALIBAN', 'anyone', 'What', 'lost', 'opportunities.Well', 'get', 'like', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'used', 'set', 'like-new', 'shape']",N/A

I was shocked when I heard they were canceling it after only four seasons. It could have easily gone seven seasons or more.All four seasons are good and feature great acting, good special effects and some great storylines. There was clearly some more story lines they wanted to do and never got the chance.I think the show was a product of some bad luck and timing. First of all it aired, at least locally for me, on an awful channel on which I watched nothing else. The channel did a poor job advertising this show and its other shows were mostly awful black comedies that seemed totally at odds with the nature of this show. Second, this was the fourth Star Trek show in a row, and I think the public was getting a bit burned out on the theme. Third, too many die hard Star Trek fans tuned out for some reason.Ill-regardless, this was a great show. I found it to be the most realistic of the Star Trek shows.

929614,A3LQDYVAAHHV2T,B000AOEMXM,FYI,"[4, 5]","Where would Trekkies be without Subterranean Caves? Episodes of ""Enterprise"" are an homage to Star Trek's enormous creative entirety. The original Trek aspired to break away from defining humans via false racial or geographic differences. The Trek universe explores what it means to be human; our shared fragility, fallibility, and uniqueness is underlined and illuminated by encounters with alien cultures.Enterprise's entire cast is deft and pitch-perfect in this Shakespearean Space Theater. There's jovial commeraderie, no Drama Queens chew the scenery. Captain Archer's dog Porthos delights. Historic Trek story-threads are developed, like the Prime Directive, halosuites, Vulcan mythology/mind melds, why Klingons looked odd in the past, and more. Details differ, diverge, and sometimes converge: although not spray-bottles, there are glowing, colorful bottles of fluid in Sick Bay, as in the Original Series.Don't punish the creative hard work in ""Enterprise"" due to mistakes, and deprive yourself of real Trek fun. The series is saddled with Diane Warren's horrible, corny, bellowing, non-Trek opening musical score. Speed through this dated ballad to view graphics, or skip and silence the singing. The fab woo-woo and bongo drums of the Original Star Trek series is more futuristic. Even the dramatic music of the ""In a Mirror, Darkly"" episodes would have been better. Unfairly, the writer and the singer of the awful score are named, but the credits don't list primary cast members with their roles, as in Deep Space Nine. Forgive this not looking exactly like the early series, as the interior visually approximates a submarine rather than the carpeted hallways of previous series. The inappropriate uniforms don't reflect the Original Series look, and the two episodes following the opening pilot ""Broken Bow"" don't do the show any favors, along with desperate attempts to add eye-appeal.The cast gels, and the ""Enterprise"" team works beautifully; time and again the acting is subtle and superb. It's worth ignoring initial attempts to make the show foolishly provoctive/trendy. Connor Trinneer's acting is graceful and deft (though his role is subjected to inexplicable suffering at the hands of the ever-shrinking Vulcan). Trek fans must experience outstanding episodes such as ""Carbon Creek,"" where first-contact was not in Bozeman, MT, or Roswell, NM (my stomping grounds), but earlier; this story is a valentine to Trekkies. ""Unexpected"" deals with an exotic alien ship and male pregnancy; Vulcan conflicts are explored in ""The Andorian Incident"" (see the infamous DSN's Weyoun, the superb Jeffrey Combs, in another incarnation, with blue skin and those wonderful mobile antennas); the wonderful ""Dear Doctor,"" Phlox considers disease & evolution. One of the best Sci-Fi shots ever depicted is in ""Proving Ground,"" beyond the back of Bakula's head, two expressive little blue Andorian antennae wave.

Since this show was in essence supposedly a prequel to TOS, it probably could have actually benefited by ditching some of the sleek, 21st Century production values and making the ship, as well as the planets they visit, a bit more gritty and cheesy looking, thus satisfying the nostalgic cravings of us old-time Trekkers who grew up with TOS.

There is a senior Vulcan officer on Enterprise, but Archer never listens to anything she says, even though she has many more years of experience than he has. During the first episode, the Vulcans said that humans weren't ready for space travel, and they were correct. During their first year in space, Archer managed to get the crew involved in armed conflicts with more than 10 different species. That is terrible leadership.

While there certainly seemed to be an abundance of ""bashers"" when the series was originally broadcast, the general mood within Trek fandom seems to have shifted a bit, allowing Enterprise to finally receive a portion of the respect that it originally deserved.Low ratings were not caused by a poor series....Enterprise was created at a time when the TV viewing public had just been exposed to fourteen, uninterrupted years of Star Trek (21 seasons in all), not to mention several movies. In my opinion, the mainstream public was simply burned out on ""Trek"". Also, the very idea of telling stories that took place PRIOR to the original series, seemed to alarm die hard fans, causing a fair amount of friction. To make things worse, UPN (The now defunct United Paramount Network) was not a healthy home for Enterprise. The network was not available in all areas across the US, and local affiliates would sometimes air episodes off-pattern (on different nights and at different times), if they even showed them at all.A poor third season was caused by Low ratings....Low ratings caused the writers to act out in desperation and initiate the ill conceived third season. While the Xindi plot-line itself is fairly interesting, the pacing of the season, and the ""Xindi"" as characters, left much to be desired. The Xindi plot was basically seen as ""Borg-Lite"" by many fans (a threatened Earth rehash).Season four; What might have been....Once the Xindi plot was wrapped up, Enterprise was back on course! Unfortunately, the news of cancellation put the writers in an awkward position. They were allowed to finish the season, but with such a limited amount of time left, they had to condense plot elements (that deserved three of four episode arcs) into single episodes. As a result, the last few episodes seemed rushed and unfinished. In particular, the resolution of the ""Trip & T'pol"" plot-line (in the final episode) left many fans feeling betrayed by the writers. Actress Jolene Blalock, who starred as T'pol, described the final episode as ""appalling"", and with good reason. ""These are the Voyages..."" (the final episode) is truly THE most insulting episode of Star Trek ever produced.If you've never seen it, I would ask that you NOT believe the negative reviews.

929634,A2BDJOIXPR2AYU,B000AOEMXM,King of Controversy,"[0, 0]","I never suspected Vulcan's were more advanced than we are. What a surprise. What was probably the shows biggest challenge (Making everything seem new, and fit seamlessly into the Star Trek omniverse) turned out to be Enterprise's best accomplishment.The first thing I notice about 'Enterprise' is that the interior of the ship, and all the crews uniforms, are all dark blue and dark gray. The bridge and the crew's uniforms are so dark, that, standing on the bridge, to exaggerate some, it's almost as if they are faces without a body. For the longest time I guessed this effect was to highlight the crews expressions. I think, however, that the shows creators were trying to avoid the 'campy' feeling of TOS (the original series).Myself, I don't find Star Trek (TOS), campy, though I can see why people do. What people find campy about it, so I thought, was all the fist-fighting and Karate chopping. It could also be the way romance is portrayed. Perhaps it is the sets and the bright costumes though. There is actually more fighting on 'Enterprise' than there is on TOS. Admittedly, on Enterprise, more of the fighting is done with Phasors, tho, there's still plenty of, if not more, fist-fighting.Deep Space Nine and 'Next Generation' have the least violence I think. To me, Next Generation was like Star Trek for women. Not just because there's considerably less violence. . . Perhaps the idea was, men would tune in no matter what. Next Generation has a lot going on, there are twice as many main characters as there are on Enterprise or on TOS. In Next Generation, it looked like the character of Spock had been split off into three separate characters. It took three characters to replace Spock (Data, Worf and Troi). Data is obvious. The connection between Worf and Spock, is that they both have alien rituals the crew get to explore/find out about, and they are both very strong. Troi, represents Spock's mind-meld and similar powers, he-he.I brought this idea up to a Star Trek fan once, that they simply took Spock and spun him off into three characters. . . This fan, really, enlightened me. He mentioned, it's been said Kirk, Spock, and McCoy, represent three aspects of one human being. The human ID, Ego, and conscience, respectively.After watching Star Trek since, I believe this is true. Like in those old TV shows... where the figure of a devil will stand behind one side of a character, saying 'do it!' and an angel behind the other, 'you'll regret it!', McCoy will stand right behinds Spock ear... ""all those colonist will have to die, that's the logical thing, isn't it Spock?"". Spock is pretty easy to figure out too. Don't be confused by Kirk, the impulsive and instinctive one, being in charge of the ship! (googling this there's some confusion as to who represents what lol). It's not something I think about when I watch the old show. In her autobiography, Nichelle Nichols says it was another producer and not Roddenberry who came up with the Kirk, Spock, McCoy dynamic.It's interesting that Kirk has been the kindest of the captains so far. Of the five captains, in my opinion, he's been the nicest guy. I am biased. The original is my favorite. They do say your first will always be your favorite.Something I noticed about Next Generation, is that each episode seems to have two themes going on. The first, the American way of life -er the Federation way of life, is in danger somehow, and the crew have to maneuver in order to save it. The second theme going on, is that someone, often a crew member, has some kind of personal problem they need to work out, and, as the episode progresses, not only is the Federation as we know it, saved, but the personal problem is resolved too. And both problems will be shown as having equal relevance! 'Enterprise' continues this trend albeit with considerably more emphasis on adventure.There are things to complain about on Enterprise. The women on the show are too passive. T'Pol rarely uses her Vulcan fighting skills and is often even a damsel in distress. And could Hoshi Sato appear more vulnerable? One could speculate that Sub-Commander T'Pol and Ensign Sato, and the rest of the crew, are nice people from a nicer future. A better future. One, where, Earthlings at least, are encouraged to express all their feelings. Sometimes it worked well. Sometimes the damsel in distress theme got annoying.I had some problems with season three, the one that focused on the Xindi threat, I think mainly because of some of the alien costumes. With the Xindi, however, Enterprise was really able to accomplish something. The Xindi threat is simply the most memorable Star Trek encounter. For me anyway. The Borg may be more famous, everyone may know the Vulcan friendship sign, and the phrase 'beam me up' may never die, but the Xindi? they left the strongest impression in my mind. Perhaps 30 episodes on one theme can do that.Season four, though, was an absolute joy. What began, and delivered, with such promise, ended in what may have been one of the best seasons of Star Trek ever. Every loose end from the past was explored, and explained. It never seemed forced. It all made sense! And was fun. I've wondered, if the writers knew the 4th season was the last, and so they just took the show where ever they wanted. They do, however, rely a lot on fighting and special effects during the final season.Enterprise: successful as their mission.",4,Worthy successor.,1333584000,"04 5, 2012",2012,5412,"['never',

Archer, T'Pol, and the crew of the first Starfleet explorer ship, ""Enterprise NX-01"" were meeting new species, and making both friends and foes alike. And Archer was the fist human to save the galaxy.This series goes to show that if they had today's video and FX technology back in the 1960's, the original Star Trek series could have looked a lot different. But ""Enterprise"" filled in some of the missing pieces about the beginning of Starfleet, that the original series never touched upon.There were critics that didn't like this series. But the big mistake that most critics make is to try and compare a sequal or spin-off series to the original. Never compare, just enjoy. At least they stuck with the original franchise formula and kept the storylines intact.Star Trek started with the Kirk generation. TNG continued the saga a bit into the future. The Star Trek movie, ""First Contact"" showed us how it all started with Cockran's first warp engine and how the Vulcans first met us. Star Trek: Enterprise filled in the blanks between First Contact and the Kirk years. This completed the Star Trek saga.Enterprise had a good 4 year run with lots of excitement. It was cancelled after it's 4th year, but that doesn't mean it was a bad show. It was only seen on the now defunct UPN network which had about 100 viewers, and never had a chance. It would have done much better in syndication as TNG did. Enterprise was a class act with a great cast.

929641,A37QUQPYFMR9Y9,B000AOEMXM,"M.D.C. ""Tempting Reviews""","[4, 7]","For the record.  I've watched every single Star Trek there has been.  The Original Series (TOS), The Next Generation (TNG), Deep Space Nine (DS9), Voyager (VOY), and now, Enterprise (ENT).  I've watched, and own, all of the various Star Trek movies that have been released to date.  I like to consider myself a resident expert on all of the characters and the branching story behind the series thus far, with the exception of Enterprise.  That's not for lack of trying - I did watch the episodes, many times.  The problem is the show itself.  Let me explain.I remember when Enterprise was first announced.  It was shortly after Gene Roddenberry left us, at a time we still had shows such as Earth: Final Conflict, Babylon 5, Farscape, Stargate, even the absolutely horrific Cleopatra 2525.  In those days sci-fi shows were a dime a dozen, and it seemed as though everyone was trying to copy everyone else.  Enterprise was touted with a dramatic commercial that said, ""Before Janeway...Before Picard...Before Kirk..."" and showed snippets of the crew experiencing such things as Klingons for the first time.  Archer, the captain of the Enterprise, had an edge to him as he was shown in verbal altercations with his Vulcan first officer.  It seemed like they had some decent ideas.  The problem was the presentation of the show; it was doomed from the start.First, and most notably, the Enterprise in ENT was noticeably more advanced than the one in TOS.  A lot of people commented on this from the very start: If this was supposed to be one of the first warp-capable ships to go out beyond Earth, why was the ship so much cleaner and advanced than Kirk's ship?  It was explained that going with older technology wouldn't have come across well on the screen, but I wholeheartedly disagree.  The reason they did what they did was to bring in new viewers who'd never watched a Star Trek in their life.  From the moment Roddenberry died, those who are in control of the franchise have done their worst to get new fans, instead of keeping what made the series popular in the first place.  People were watching Kirk battling aliens as far back as the 60's yet stopped watching sometime after DS9 because of this dynamic.Secondly, Season 1.  It was riddled with incidents that were absolutely unnecessary; times when the crew were experiencing things for the first time, i.e. Klingons, phasers, photon torpedoes, the transporter...it was like at first they tried their best to appeal to Star Trek fans, but it felt overdone and overemphasized.  The attempt was novel, the approach was wrong.Third, and maybe this is just me, but Johnathan Archer got on my nerves.  Scott Bakula is a good actor when he wants to be.  The problem is that he was too good an actor in Quantum Leap: it was hard not to imagine the blue flashing light and him leaping out of there, into someone else's life.  This feeling never once went away the entire time I watched, and usually that's an indicator that their acting in the present show is not nearly as good as their acting in the previous show.  I don't blame Bakula.  He did the best he could with what he was handed.  However, I don't think using him for this show was a good idea at all.  A distant descendant of Christopher Pike would have been better suited; someone serious and up to the task, because that's what all of the other captains essentially were.  Bakula's notoriety from Quantum Leap hurt his credibility in ENT; even more so when they had Dean Stockwell (Al, from Quantum Leap) guest starred in an episode in Season 2.  Archer's seriousness and fits of anger felt forced and contrived, rather than genuinely heartfelt.  It was just all around bad, in my humble opinion.  What's worse, the writers made him seem invincible.  Numerous times he is either killed, nearly killed or should have been killed, yet manages to not only survive, but pull off impossible feats: pilot ships from foreign worlds without issue, survive many hours of torture and pain, go days without eating, even make a time travel device MacGuyver-style from a desolate wasteland.  The show centers around him, and it hurt the show severely.Fourth, and I won't spoil it, but suffice to say that Johnathan Frakes and Marina Sirtis should be ashamed of themselves for what they did.  I think they are now, but it's too little too late.I could go on and on, but those are the major ones.  Now I'll give you a brief rundown of the various seasons.SEASON 1: The pilot.  This is where most of the Human/Vulcan antagonism is felt, as well as the crew's curiosity and desire to visit new worlds and make first contact with other species.  Some of these are from the Star Trek canon: Vulcans, Andorians, etc.  All of the crew are briefly introduced, and some background is given about each, with the exception of two.  Hoshi Sato is a language specialist that is teaching in Brazil.  She is acquainted with Archer, and her presence is requested on the ship.  T'Pol is assigned to Enterprise by the Vulcan High Command to evaluate the progress of their mission.  Charles ""Trip"" Tucker is the chief engineer and a long time friend of Archer.  Malcolm Reed is the tactical officer, but he's not introduced (there's a good reason for this though, revealed in Season 4.  See more there), and nobody knows much about him, not even his parents.  Travis Mayweather is the primary helmsman, and a former cargo runner from a family business.  Phlox, one of only two aliens on Enterprise, is a noted Denobulan physician.The good thing about Season 1 is the drama.  The exchanges between T'Pol and Archer were good, and it felt as though the two had a opposing magnetism that would prove to be entertaining.  Sadly this antagonism would dwindle by Season 2, never to be seen again, and would prove detrimental to the overall story.  Also, T'Pol never came across truly ""Vulcan"" in the vein of Spock (who ironically was half human unlike T'Pol).  Every Vulcan had a presence about him, an air of superiority and leadership.  T'Pol showed neither trait anytime during Season 1, which in my opinion hurt her character.SEASON 2: There was a much stronger focus on shock value.  Here, there are more interactions with alien worlds, as well as the attack on Earth that led to the Delphic Expanse.  Archer finds out that one of his crewmen is actually a time traveller, the battles with the Suliban begin to take shape, and it is here that Archer turns into Mr. Unstoppable.  There is a little sexual tension between Archer and T'Pol, but nothing too compelling; the crew are adjusting to life on the ship.  Tucker and Reed are improving the ship's systems.  T'Pol is subjected to her first mind meld and contracts a disease that affects her ability to suppress emotions.  Ferengi are introduced here.Season 2 was the slowest of the four; it didn't really do much to advance the story until the final episodes, when the Xindi storyline began, and another episode that dealt with the destruction of the colony and more time travel events.SEASON 3: Might as well refer to this as the ""Xindi Season"", since that's really all it dealt with.  The Xindi launched an attack on Earth, killing over 7 million, including Trip's sister.  Trip, in his grief, is having trouble sleeping.  Meanwhile, there is friction between the Vulcan High Command and Archer over going after the Xindi, which leads to Archer going anyway, and T'Pol dropping her commission to join them.  They encounter a Vulcan ship that was lost years prior, filled with Vulcans that had been subverted by an ore.  T'Pol is affected during this, and later develops an addiction that, in conjunction with the mind meld disease, causes negative effects.  She and Tucker undergo a relaxation massage ritual to help Tucker sleep which eventually leads into more intimacy between them.  Enterprise encounters many different types of Xindi and other races in the Expanse, and with the aid of some of the Xindi, manages to stop the attack on Earth, but again, Mr. Unstoppable strikes again as he escapes certain death effortlessly.Season 3 felt like Star Trek: Nemesis in a way and that's not a compliment.  The T'Pol/Tucker angle was well done, and the Xindi storyline added some much-needed beef to a show that had so far been underwhelming.  If it weren't for the fact that Archer managed to yet again overcome impossible odds, and the fact that Enterprise, a ship based on technology that should have been light years behind the Xindi, managed to survive everything the Xindi and other races threw at it, it might have been a decent season, but there were too many things that just didn't make sense.SEASON 4: After the peace with the remaining Xindi, the Enterprise returns home, only to find that the humans are no longer comfortable with non-humans.  This kicks off a rebel faction called Terra Prime that is out to cleanse Earth of non-humans.  Phlox encounters racism, Vulcans are attacked and threatened, a Mars colony is taken over and used to threaten the planet, and other events that are reminiscent of Babylon 5's later events with Edgar Industries and their attempt to eradicate telepaths.  Various TOS, TNG and DS9 references are explained here, such as the Gorn, Soong's androids (Data, Lore, B-4), Khan and the other superhumans, and the Tholian Web.  This is also supposed to introduce the alternate universe, first seen in TOS and later in DS9.  It ends with the signing of the Federation Charter by Archer, and the death of a central crew member.  It also marked the apparent first introduction of Section 31, which Reed had been a member of (thus explaining why nobody knew anything about him when he came aboard.  He was sent to be their eyes and ears, though there was no evidence of this in any of the seasons).  We are introduced to T'Pau, the one who would go on to become a high ranking Vulcan official, overseeing the pon farr battle ritual between Spock and Kirk.You know, Season 4 had its moments.  It quite possibly was the most exciting of all of the seasons in terms of its presentation, but the problem is that it did way too much, wrong.  The way it handled the alternate universe was so haphazard that it negated any potential value of explaining it.  The death of the crewmember was absolutely pointless and never would have happened otherwise; there was no logic to doing it, and said person was a lot more resourceful and collected than they portrayed them to be.  The Terra Prime Incident had potential that was unrealized by the writers; instead of a rogue mining colony and spies all over the place (it was also a mistake to not have subtle activities by Reed to show that he was doing covert operations for Section 31, starting with Season 1 when he first came aboard.  Show him saying vague statements on encrypted channels to someone, keep the watchers guessing as to what he's doing.  This was a missed opportunity).  The episode with the Orion slave girls made absolutely no sense; there was no evidence in any of the other Star Trek series that the slave girls had pheromone-based mind control powers over men.  The Defiant destroying the Tholian Web also made no sense, as TOS made it quite clear that the web was incapacitating to a ship from that era, and it took essentially a subspace anomaly to get Enterprise free.  The alternate universe episodes were the most entertaining of all of the episodes in the series, but they were harmed by one small factoid: They should have been an Enterprise movie.  Period.  Even the entrance theme had been changed to show the darkness of this new showing, and such a thing might have garnered interest.  It wouldn't have hurt to add more to it as well...it ended abruptly with Empress Sato without explaining her significance to anything.The worst thing about Season 4 was the series finale, for sure.  I won't spoil that, but again, Frakes and Sirtis should be ashamed of themselves.  They basically gave a big middle finger to all of the actors in this series, especially with the way it ended.So...do I recommend buying this?  Only if you just want to know all there is about Star Trek and want to add this to the collection.  I agree the price is steep; don't buy it new.  Look for Warehouse Deals, they usually have a good price on this set.  As a Star Trek series, it's last in the bunch for sure.",4,Truly a mixed bag if there ever was one.,1270857600,"04 10, 2010",2010,12331,"['record', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'single', 'Star', 'Trek',

It's unfortunate that the legions of Star Trek fans deserted Enterprise just as it was building up steam. With the telecast nights changing from season to season, the series never had a proper chance to find its audience. Plus, for some reason the hard-core trekers seemed miffed at the show. Some said it was because the theme song had words. Can you believe it? For me, Enterprise remains my favorite of all the Star Treks, with The Next Generation coming in a close second. What many ST fans often forget is TNG took a few seasons to build up a good following. Enterprise has it all: a dynamite cast, fine acting, great writing, fascinating characters, engrossing story arcs... It's a shame the producers abandoned it after the fantastic story lines of the final two seasons. Equally shameful was the last episode, which was totally inappropriate and a cop out.

My love for the franchise grew as each incarnation emerged on DVD; each series has moved over one seat in my affections to make room for Star Trek: Enterprise, available at truly a bargain price on Amazon.Enterprise is a magnificent experience on DVD.  The show laid some solid groundwork in justifying Captain Archer's determination first to get to and then to stay in outer space.  The remainder of the cast also does a stout job of behaving as though all of that other Trek stuff hasn't happened yet.  The effects on the shows are of motion picture quality, and the sound is house shaking.  Granted, Enterprise could have done more, especially in their earlier seasons.

There were many episodes I missed. Now that I have binge watched the whole thing, I think it is a shame they did not get to the Romulan war as season 5 or a follow on movie. Not popular enough for that at all, everyone already tuned out by the time this series turned the corner.  Many, many weak episodes straying from the &#34;canonical&#34; trek history or approach. There was a lot more dark side in this series, I think than any other. It shows the growing pains that were needed to get to the essentially optimistic original Trek Series federation future.This series has the best engineer of all engineers  (sorry Scotty) in Charles Tucker. It spotlights how the help of a good wrench is worth more than a thousand diplomatic words when you are stalled in space, (or stuck in a tight battle). Season 3 is a long grind through the darkness with many twists and turns resolving the temporal cold war, something never mentioned in any other Trek series.  Season 4 is by far the best set of episodes without the constant long mission focus of season 3. It attempts to resolve a lot of historical questions never otherwise addressed, like smooth brow Klingons, and largely done successfully. Some excellent episodes in Season 3 and 4. Horrible contrived and evil final ending episode that was basically a big resentful dog dropping onto the franchise and the fans. Supposedly, in the follow on books, Commander Tucker faked his death and joined the mysterious section 31  to become a technology spy and saboteur of the Romulan war effort. That could only be an improvement, however improbable it sounds for the basically gregarious and outgoing character.These dvd's are packaged in the most complicated, space hogging, ill designed holders I have ever experienced. Very easy to drop bits and pieces just getting to the DVD's. A giant two piece plastic clamshell, a transparent sleeve and then a hinged six disc holder. And one of the center dvd pins just snapped off removing the dvd. The dvd's themselves are excellent quality, none of the out of the box scratches, pixilation ghosts or other glitching I am coming to expect. Excellent quality control, probably because they were done correctly the first time and sitting on the shelf for years. Overall special effects are very good for TV, lot of good production values in all 4 seasons. It's probably going to look pretty good in blu ray.Overall, this series deserves more respect than it got at the time.

929649,ACTHUAU2A70DF,B000AOEMXM,"M. Sharpless ""NERV""","[4, 4]","This is a long time coming, and I know there is already a ton of reviews for this series.  I just have to give my take on this series just too kind of cleanse my soul after watching it for the second time.Broken Bow was the start of the series, and it had a lot of promise and it gave me so much hope for the show.  Who wouldn't want to see the missions before the Original Trek Crew of Kirk and Spock?  In this episode we see the Klingons for the first time in the Trek universe and to any fan of Star Trek you immediately notice something that most casual fans might not.  So it starts to make you think about the possibilities of what could have happened.  It was a great time to be a Trek fan.Season One started out strong and for the most part was a great first step in building the Trek universe, That said Season  two was dragged down by time travel, too much was used to try and explain things.  It was unnecessary and a cheap way to explain things.  In my opinion it brought the show down and ruined what could have been an outstanding show.  The second season turns Enterprise into an acceptable TV drama that was to busy trying to confuse everyone.Season two brought more time travel into the mix with trying to expand the ""Temporal Cold War"".  Season one had the ""Temporal Cold War"" and if you didn't get it by the end of season one, season two and three throw it in your face every time they can.  It really cheapens the Trek universe and it reveals too much to Captain Archer.  Even with all the future information given to him you wonder why he makes some of the decisions he makes knowing full well what would happen if he just did it another way.  With the information given to Captain Archer about the Federation being formed you feel as if it deprives you and him of the experience of creating it.  There was no need for time travel in this show.  Season two was were a lot of the fans left the show on to better things.If Season two was not enough to make you turn it off, Season three was another good reason to do so.  As with season two and one the ""Temporal Cold War"" plays a big role with the Xindi learning of how Earth is going to destroy their home world from another faction of the Cold War feeding the Xindi lies.  This in an attempt to destroy humans so the other species manipulating the Xindi could eventually take over the known universe.  So you guessed it, more time travel and more nonsense.  The Season starts off with the Xindi sending a massive weapon of mass destruction to Earth which ends up killing 7 million people.  So humans and Enterprise has to go to ""The Expanse"" to find the Xindi and stop them from completing an even bigger weapon that would destroy Earth in one blow.  This Season also tries to strengthen a romance that you feel was developing slightly in the First and Second seasons.  The season ends with Enterprise being thrown back into time.  Once again you're left wondering if they will just let the ""Cold War"" die and get back to being Star Trek!!If you managed to stick with the show you're finally made it to the best part of what unfortunately became the last season of this show.  It started out weak with the whole time travel thing, but they finally stopped the nonsense with time travel and focused on what was important.  It got the series back on track, and featured more of the aliens we have come to know.  The first part started off with the Augments and even has a reference to the ""Botany Bay"" and ""KHAN""!  The show also started to explain the Klingon disease that changed their appearance to what we saw in the Original Show with Kirk.  This Fourth season was what we craved the show to be from the start and it was delivering on so many levels only to destroy you in the finial episode.The last episode is what makes people cringe with fear when they watch this show.  They know what's coming.  I for one hated the last episode as it basically makes you feel the whole experience was a joke from the start.  Was it real are all fake?  The little joke they had going though the whole series about a chief which you never see until now makes you wonder was it all worth it.  The last episode cheapens what the whole cast had worked for and basically turned it into a half baked Star Trek ""The Next Generation"" episode.A few things could have been changed and this episode would have been great!  Change one would be get rid of the TNG cast and all references to TNG.  Let it be about Enterprise and not William Riker!  Don't kill off an awesome character that everyone agrees is one of the best in the show for no reason.  This was done just to make fans talk, and it was senseless, there was no point in the killing and it seemed so forced like it was a joke to the writers.  Lastly show the speech we all wanted to see.  Why was this never shown?  It was start of the federation, the speech that made it comes into being and nothing was shown.  If you took out all the worthless TNG crap they would have had plenty of time to show the speech.  Besides that it was an ok episode and I understood what they were trying to do, but it failed miserably. ( I really believe if you just take out the one death, everyone would be happy with this episode, it would not make it so hated like it is.  Still a bad episode but that one death thows it over the top of being bad).Besides the last episode and the clunky 2nd and 3rd season, this is a great show.  The fourth season really does hit a home run, and it's too bad they canceled it.  I hope they could do something in the future with Star Trek.  It's like something has been missing for so long from TV and it needs to come back in the ""Original Time Line"".  Maybe the first episode should try and fix the damage done to Enterprise with another holodeck recreation of the 'Real Events"".  Having said how badly this show ends, I would still recommend this show to Trek Fans.  It's a great show and it was enjoyable to watch twice though.Update:I got the Blu-Ray and I am not blown away by the picture, but I am very happy.  I never really owned the real DVD set so(I bought my DVD's in Afghanistan, so what I really have is a Ripped version of the show. :-), I thought it was about time I buy the show in a proper format.First, I would like everyone to understand the reason why the first season of ""Enterprise"" is not up to picture quality like ""The Original Star Trek"" or ""The Next Generation"".  This is not a remaster of ""Enterprise"". This is simply a transfer of the original film to blu-ray disk.  I am not the only one to realize this, Blu-Ray.com does not really talk about this, but another review does.  Read the Digitalbits review it's very spot on!!The picture is an upgrade over the DVD's, but its not a huge upgrade.  If you are like me and have not bought the DVDs yet, than this is the set you want.  You will not be disappointed in the quality.  The first episode was the worse picture out the whole season, but it did get better along the way.  I believe this is due to the fact that the show was filmed when HD was still very young.  On the plus side it's the first Star Trek filmed in Widescreen.The sound is not great, but it is 5.1 and it's an upgrade over the DVD's. The best thing about ""Enterprise"" on blu-ray is the special features.  Words can not express the amount of extra's you get on this Blu-Ray.  The extras alone prove how much love CBS put into this Blu-Ray set.  If you think CBS is taking your money for a substandard blu-ray than the Special Features prove you wrong.  All of the DVD extras and even the Best Buy Extras are presented here, plus a few new ones that will blow you away on the amount of information given on why the show was not what it could have been.Overall the score for this release is a solid 8 out of 10 for me.  The picture could have been remastered, but I understand the reason why it was not. The picture was state of the art back in 2001 but today it does not hold up.  The sound is good but could have been great.  Despite the little problems ""Enterprise"" on blu-ray comes warping out of space dock onto your TV in a great package and is a overall great value.",4,These Are the Voyages!!

Siddiqi,"[81, 117]","First off, if you buy each of the 4 ST:ENT seasons separately, they collectively cost you less than $400 BUT if you buy them together in the form of this boxed set, it costs you $480. D-uh? Who came up with this brilliant marketing strategy? Shouldn't it be the other way around that if you buy the boxed set it should cost you LESS than buying each of the seasons separately? Who in his or her right mind is going to buy this offering?(N.B. After I originally wrote this review, a 10% discount appeared bringing the price down to $431. Nice try, but buying the individual seasons separately STILL costs less than buying this boxed set!)Now to rate the show itself, I think Enterprise started off on a good foot with good intentions but then lost its way. The theme of creating a retro series didn't suck. It wasn't a bad idea, but it seemed that as the further in the series went, the writers were struggling to find the show's calling. If you look at the other three series, namely, TNG, DS9 and Voyager, halfway into EACH of the series, they had each found their respective callings and directions, by the third season usually.But in the case of Enterprise it seemed as if someone was trying to invent a new direction and find the show's way into every season and we were back at square-one. I personally feel that is what eventually became the show's undoing. With the other series, three seasons in the audience knew what they were coming back for -- they all started out sort of directionless but settled in by the third season. That never galvanized in the case of Enterprise and it looked like we were pursuing a completely new theme with each season. You could see the writers fumbling at times when you watch some of the episodes across the 4 seasons. That probably led to viewer loss. The effects were definitely better (obviously), the acting was not bad either.Season 1 started off okay. But by season 2, loss of connecting elements and a cohesive theme was becoming apparent. Season 3 was a vagabond season in my opinion because it might have been good as a standalone season with the whole Delphic Expanse storyline but then the whole show just went 180 degrees when season 4 came and you mainly had all these ""mini-plots"" of 2 or 3 episodes filling it up, but no developing theme at the series level. Then suddenly half way into the fourth season it seemed as if someone told them to wrap it up and the fourth season's second half packed in storylines and plots that were meant to be told across 3 more seasons rather than half a season. The federation came into being, some band tried to derail it, someone got killed and we ended up with Riker and Troi in the finale -- fruit cocktail. The whole second half of the last season went by in an incoherent blur.In simple words into the fourth season it fell apart. ""All the king's horses and all the king's men could not put...""In the end I think eventually die hard Star Trek aficionados will get this series irrespective. The production was good. It had its moments too and there are some brilliant episodes in many of the seasons but in the end the writers couldn't hold it together.My 2-star rating applies not to the show itself, but to this ridiculous offering of a boxed set.

I'd been expecting a bulky box holding four individually-packed seasons of ""Star Trek: Enterprise,"" such as I'd seen in stores (for a considerably higher price).  Instead this package appeared to contain only a single season.  Curious, I opened it while still at the post office.  Inside was a silver box reminiscent of the ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" release from a few years earlier.  I opened this, and there were all 27 DVDs in gauzy cloth-and-plastic sleeves.  The entire four-season run of the series, all neatly crammed into a box the size of a single season's worth of episodes.  It's very different from the picture shown, but any attempt to reduce packaging & clutter is fine by me!This set appears to be a Chinese-made product intended for a Canadian market.  The text on the package is slightly ""off"" in ways that Trekkers will notice, despite the fact that some details are the obvious result of a good deal of research and love for the series.  Naturally, I was a little worried; what if the episodes were dubbed into French, with no English dialogue track?  My Universal Translator hasn't been invented yet!Fear not.  These are the episodes I'd seen and enjoyed on TV, with the same aspect ratio and English subtitles if desired.  There are also foreign-language audio and subtitle tracks available.  As an added bonus, some episodes include optional deleted scenes.My only ""complaint"" is a mild one: there is no table of contents, either in the box or printed on the discs.  As I'm watching the episodes, I'm writing one up on a sheet of loose-leaf paper so I can locate particular favorites later with ease.  Frankly, I doubt that this minor inconvenience would be considered a problem to any serious fan of the show.

929653,A20NVE1U6G8C7N,B000AOEMXM,Nils,"[1, 1]","I bought this four season set because I had enjoyed the first season (which I had watched online), and wanted to watch the entire series.  I knew it was a bit of a gamble, because shows often go downhill and fizzle out in their second season. But I had liked the first one enough I decided to take a chance.Having watched the entire series now,  my feeling is:1) the first season was by far the best.  It had a focused story arc, centering largely around the volatile relationship between humans and Vulcans, and their troubled history.  This gave the show interesting emotional undercurrents, gave an effective focus to Archer's relationship with his Vulcan science officer T'Pol, and provided a strong underlying theme that unified the episodes.  Most of the episodes in the first season were well written and reasonably well acted.2) The second season began sliding downhill.  It had a few good episodes, but also several bad and pointless ones.  It seemed to lose energy and direction after the first episode (which hurriedly resolved, then shelved, the interesting issues raised in the first issue finale about the temporal cold war). The series then floundered for a while while the writers seemed to struggle with where to go with the storylines, and how to inject drama and human conflict into a generally unfocused story arc.The second season also revealed an inherent flaw in the underlying logic and premise of the series: When Archer and his crew go out to ""explore the Universe"" in the first season, it's implied that they're the first humans to do so, because Vulcans have been holding back human space exploration for decades.  In this season we learn that there are human-run cargo ships tooling around at high warp in deep space, and apparently have been for decades. So cargo ships have been going out routinely ""where no man has gone before"" without the Vulcans objecting, but a general exploration ship has been unable to?  Ah, what?  If that's the case, it makes the early Star Fleet look naive and inept.  It's rather as if the starship Voyager had encountered random humans out picnicking in the Delta Quadrant, while on its several years mission to try to get back to earth, in the ST Voyager series a few years back.3) The third season was more fun and more tightly focused (to my mind) than the second. The stories were more tightly written and directed.  All in all, I liked season 3 much better than season 2.... until the really silly and stupid ending of the season finale, which set us up for some terrible episodes in season 4.4) I then watched the first five episodes of season 4, and found them almost unwatchable. The acting, writing and direction all slid downhill.  The acting became more cardboard, the stories silly, trite and predictable.  Then it turned around again, and the last several episodes showed marked improvement.  The ""mirror darkly"" episodes, dealing with the STE crew in an alternative universe, with alternative histories, was particularly fun.  The Terra Nova episodes again brought a good sense of focus and timing to the storylines.  The ending had some nice surprises, bringing back some characters from another Star Trek series.What to make of it all? Some good, some bad.... Some compelling, some unwatchable.  The good episodes were fun and memorable. The bad ones, I'm trying to forget.  All in all though, it had enough good episodes that if you're a fan of the other Star Trek series, it's likely you'll enjoy it.",4,Uneven but fun.,1359331200,"01 28, 2013",2013,3479,"['bought', 'four', 'season', 'set', 'had', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'season', 'had', 'watched', 'online', 'wanted', 'watch', 'entire', 'series', 'knew', 'was', 'bit', 'gamble', 'shows', 'often', 'go', 'downhill', 'out', 'second', 'season', 'had', 'liked', 'first', 'one', 'enough', 'decided', 'take', 'chance.Having', 'watched', 'entire', 'series', 'now', 'feeling', 'is:1', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'far', 'best', 'had', 'focused', 'story', 'arc', 'centering', 'largely', 'volatile', 'relationship', 'humans', 'Vulcans', 'troubled', 'history', 'gave', 'show', 'interesting', 'emotional', 'undercurrents', 'gave', 'effective', 'focus', 'Archer', 'relationship', 'Vulcan', 'science', 'officer', ""T'Pol"", 'provided', 'strong', 'underlying', 'theme', 'unified', 'episodes', 'Most', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'were', 'well', 'written', 'reasonably', 'well', 'acted.2', 'second', 'season', 'began', 'sliding', 'downhill', 'had', 'few', 'good', 'episodes', 'also', 'several', 'bad', 'pointless', 'ones', 'seemed', 'lose', 'energy', 'direction', 'first', 'episode', 'hurriedly', 'resolved', 'then', 'shelved', 'interesting', 'issues', 'raised', 'first', 'issue', 'finale', 'temporal', 'cold', 'war', 'series', 'then', 'floundered', 'while', 'writers', 'seemed', 'struggle', 'where', 'go', 'storylines', 'how', 'inject', 'drama', 'human', 'conflict', 'generally', 'unfocused', 'story', 'arc.The', 'second', 'season', 'also', 'revealed', 'inherent', 'flaw', 'underlying', 'logic', 'premise', 'series', 'When', 'Archer', 'crew', 'go', 'explore', 'Universe', 'first', 'season', 'implied', ""'re"", 'first', 'humans', 'do', 'so', 'Vulcans', 'have', 'been', 'holding', 'back', 'human', 'space', 'exploration', 'decades', 'season', 'learn', 'are', 'human-run', 'cargo', 'ships', 'tooling', 'around', 'high', 'warp', 'deep', 'space', 'apparently', 'have', 'been', 'decades', 'So', 'cargo', 'ships', 'have', 'been', 'going', 'out', 'routinely', 'where', 'man', 'gone', 'before', 'Vulcans', 'objecting', 'general', 'exploration', 'ship', 'been', 'unable', 'Ah', 'what', 'case', 'early', 'Star', 'Fleet', 'look', 'naive', 'inept', 'rather', 'starship', 'Voyager', 'had', 'encountered', 'random', 'humans', 'out', 'picnicking', 'Delta', 'Quadrant', 'several', 'years', 'mission', 'try', 'get', 'back', 'earth', 'ST', 'Voyager', 'series', 'few', 'years', 'back.3', 'third', 'season', 'was', 'more', 'fun', 'more', 'tightly', 'focused', 'mind', 'second', 'stories', 'were', 'more', 'tightly', 'written', 'directed', 'liked', 'season', '3', 'much', 'better', 'season', '2', 'really', 'silly', 'stupid', 'ending', 'season', 'finale', 'set', 'up', 'terrible', 'episodes', 'season', '4.4', 'then', 'watched', 'first', 'five', 'episodes', 'season', '4', 'found', 'almost', 'unwatchable', 'acting', 'writing', 'direction', 'slid', 'downhill', 'acting', 'became', 'more', 'cardboard', 'stories', 'silly', 'trite', 'predictable', 'Then', 'turned', 'around', 'again', 'last', 'several', 'episodes', 'showed', 'marked', 'improvement', 'mirror', 'darkly', 'episodes', 'dealing', 'STE', 'crew', 'alternative', 'universe', 'alternative', 'histories', 'was', 'particularly', 'fun', 'Terra', 'Nova', 'again', 'brought', 'good', 'sense', 'focus', 'timing', 'storylines', 'ending', 'had', 'nice', 'surprises', 'bringing', 'back', 'characters', 'Star', 'Trek', 'series.What', 'make', 'good', 'bad', 'compelling', 'unwatchable', 'good', 'episodes', 'were', 'fun', 'memorable', 'bad', 'ones', ""'m"", 'trying', 'forget', 'had', 'enough', 'good', 'episodes', ""'re"", 'fan', 'other', 'Star', 'Trek', 'series', 'likely', ""'ll"", 'enjoy']",N/A
929654,AHF97M45JFCB,B000AOEMXM,ONENEO,"[1, 1]","I should start this review by disclaiming a remarkable fact: I purchased the complete series of Star Trek Enterprise a few years back without ever having watched a single episode of the show during its broadcast run.  I say this not because I seek your respect, admiration or pity (though were you to insist on either of the first two, I suppose I wouldn't complain) but rather to illustrate a simple point:  When it comes to sci-fi entertainment, the Trek legacy has some pretty big shoes to fill as far as I'm concerned.So the big question you're probably asking yourself is whether or not I feel it was money well spent and I'll be glad to divulge such information but before doing so, let's take a moment to break down the hard facts of the show and its DVD release so as to further determine whether or not this is the set for you, shall we?Set in the nearby regions of the Milky Way galaxy, during roughly the 2150s (ten years before the United Federation of Planets would be formed), the show follows the adventures of humanity's very first warp 5 capable starship: Enterprise.According to the mythos, at warp 2, only a handful of inhabited planets were within a year's travel from Earth.  But at warp 5, that number increased to ten thousand planets and thus it is the appointed task of Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula) & crew to visit as many of these worlds as possible.The show debuted September 26 2001 on UPN and ran for 98-episodes spanning a total of 4-seasons (ending on May 13, 2005).  Low ratings are credited for its demise and unfortunately the dubious distinction of being the first Star Trek series since the original to have been cancelled by its network rather than finished by producers.  It's also the bookend of an amazing run of Trek TV: The last series in an 18-year run of back-to-back new Star Trek shows beginning with Star Trek: The Next Generation in 1987.That said, I can truly state that I went into the program with absolutely no expectations or predeterminations save for those established during previous Trek incarnations (most notably Next Generation and Deep Space 9).  Initially I was a bit let down with the Enterprise formula.  The first season, at least in my opinion, struggled to find itself.  The cast didn't seem overly believable, the sets were deficient in imagination and perhaps most of all, the prose simply lacked that slightly mind-bending flow of believability that has always been a staple of the Star Trek experience to me.Granted, I realize that this particular point in the mythos' timeline is supposed to be laced with claustrophobia and marvel considering it represents humanity's first foray into the galactic fold; the episodes themselves were a bit meandering to me with emphasis on action and quick resolve over the technologically brilliant conclusions to seemingly unsolvable dilemmas I'd come to cherish in past Trek efforts.I made it through the fairly lackluster first season and the initial half of the second, starting to assume this would be the formula for the entire series only to be pleasantly surprised somewhere around the halfway point of the second season.  Suddenly it was as if the cast had fallen into rhythm with both the characters they portrayed and interaction with one another.  Perhaps even more importantly, however, was the writing seemed to have taken a huge step forward as well.Episodes became far less reliant upon the gimmick of making the viewer privy to events of historical importance (even those that came off feeling like cheap reenactments) and instead simply dropped the cast of characters into some interesting scenarios where their sharp wits and collaboration became crucial for survival.  It didn't hurt that technological explanations and believable science became cornerstones of the formula as well.By the time the second season concluded, I was quite excited about starting out the third in the hopes of it continuing on with its newfound rhythm.  The third season, however, made another radical departure to the recipe, this time becoming a single episode that happens to take an entire season to develop.  While this was surely a risky move as far as syndication opportunities are concerned, viewers of the DVDs do get to follow along on a very solid dilemma with high stakes (earth being the target) and a whole bunch of exotic locales, species, alliances and betrayals to keep things interesting.Once again however I fear the tendency of the show's habit of going one step forward for two steps back rears its head.  The third season thread is resolved, well that's not technically correct, ends on a cliffhanger that carries into the fourth (and final) season.Here we kick things off with an alternate universe scenario that, aside from learning an entire episode was merely a dream, ranks up there as one of my lesser-appreciated cop outs in fiction.  This rather odd thread involving World War II era earth carries through for a couple of episodes, returns so stand-alone episode format then returns with but another alternate universe crescendo multi-parter.  This time the crew of Enterprise in an alternate dimension, one where violence and ruthlessness reign supreme, happen upon Kirk's Enterprise from the original series (complete with wonky sound effects and 60s-style uniforms) and intend to use the vastly superior tech to overthrow their totalitarian empire.  Many of the moments of this particular thread come off as forcefully comedic and, I suspect, not nearly as polished a finished product as it must have seemed on paper.Then, just when things are at their proverbial darkest hour, the 4th season concludes with an interesting thread centered on human-supremacy groups resorting to terrorist actions to preserve the human-way of life on earth during impending alien cohabitation.  I won't give away any spoilers, but let me just say that the final episode of the show takes a clever, fairly brilliant, approach to sending off the crew of Enterprise as only a cast & crew aware that the show has reached its conclusion can.I suppose if my ramblings and summaries thus far need have amounted to anything, I would hope they resemble a reflection to the fact that the show is a bit inconsistent at best.  There are moments sprinkled about its 4-season run that truly hark back to the finer moments of Star Trek's fabled history but unlike say Next Generation, consistent brilliance is simply not a given.  However, when Enterprise does hit its marks, and rest assured- it does, it's right up there with the quality and depth of storytelling Trekkers have come to expect from the franchise.In closing, to those who have endured my rather lengthy critique wondering whether this box set is worth their time and money, I have to say that I did find myself watching the entire program successively in about a year's time including all of the commentary and bonus materials.  In even its darkest moments, Star Trek is still superior to just about 99% of all science fiction out there and this show does continue on in that tradition.  Though my words may have come off as harsh at times, please do keep in mind that many of the flaws and shortcomings mentioned manifest when compared to the impeccable past Trek incarnations first and foremost.  When judged on their own accord (especially against what passes for science fiction television of late), nearly everything I mentioned can be overlooked!I am glad to have the most recent Trek incarnation taking its rightful place on the entertainment center shelf next to Voyager before it and am hoping, for better or worse, that the powers-that-be get to work on its successor.  There is something inherently missing in a world that does not have a current Star Trek series on the air.",4,Considered One of the Weaker Entries in the Trek Universe but still Star

929658,ALD1CRUBY1365,B000AOEMXM,R. L. MILLER,"[0, 16]","It's almost an oxymoron, isn't it? But it describes this series to a T. Ever since the ""Original Series"", the Star Trek franchise has been defined more by its fanbase than its content or cast. That segment of the population which outsiders prefer to call ""nerds"". A few months before this series came out, SNL cast member Norm MacDonald announced the impending release of a new Star Trek series on that show's ""Weekend Update"" sketch as being for ""nerds"". Probably the best definition of that term, once you cull out all the facets that totally differ from person to person, get rid of all the stuff that amounts to non-ethnic bigotry, face the fact that a nerd isn't necessarily the kid who gets better marks in school or reads too much--the solidest definition of ""nerds"" is people who are overenthusiastic about things that the mainstream could care less about. The Star Trek fanbase has overdone it, to be sure. Showing up at conventions in full Starfleet uniform when only a small percentage of sports fans own their team's official jersey. And sports fans are a more powerful demographic than ""Trekkies"" any day of the week. What this series amounts to is a Star Trek For Non-Wierdos, which is a contradiction in terms when you remember that sci-fi is by definition about weird stuff. What you have to do is come up with a vehicle that can impress the middle school market, a population segment that has a built-in sneer on its collective face. So we have a captain who's an aging dreamboat, a foxy Vulcan who has the requisite regal beauty, a Tac Officer who looks like he could be a descendant of 007 and a Texan good ole boy chief engineer. The doc is an alien who defines ""avuncular""--you can easily imagine him in tweed and glen plaid. Maybe it was George Dubya Bush who killed off this segment of the Trek franchise--it went under about when the former President began to be the most venomously hated. Engineer Trip Tucker, initially the most likable character here, resembles him way too much. Or maybe it's that old truism about consumerism that goes something like ""You can take a dog dropping and roll it in confectioner's sugar and it still won't be a pastry item--all it'll be is a sugar-coated dog dropping"".",2,"Would You Believe ""Cool Trek""?",1247443200,"07 13, 2009",2009,2227,"['almost', 'oxymoron', ""n't"", 'series', 'T.', 'Ever', 'Original', 'Series', 'Star', 'Trek', 'franchise', 'been', 'defined', 'more', 'fanbase', 'content', 'cast', 'segment', 'population', 'prefer', 'call', 'nerds', 'few', 'months', 'series', 'came', 'out', 'SNL', 'cast', 'member', 'Norm', 'MacDonald', 'announced', 'impending', 'release', 'new', 'Star', 'Trek', 'series', 'show', 'Weekend', 'Update', 'sketch', 'being', 'nerds', 'Probably', 'best', 'definition', 'term', 'once', 'cull', 'out', 'facets', 'totally', 'differ', 'person', 'person', 'get', 'rid', 'stuff', 'non-ethnic', 'bigotry', 'face', 'fact', 'nerd', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'kid', 'who', 'better', 'marks', 'school', 'reads', 'too', 'much', 'solidest', 'definition', 'nerds', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'overenthusiastic', 'things', 'mainstream', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'about', 'Star', 'Trek', 'fanbase', 'overdone', 'be', 'sure', 'Showing', 'up', 'conventions', 'full', 'Starfleet', 'uniform', 'when', 'only', 'small', 'percentage', 'sports', 'fans', 'own', 'team', 'official', 'jersey', 'sports', 'fans', 'are', 'more', 'powerful', 'demographic', 'Trekkies', 'day', 'week', 'What', 'series', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Non-Wierdos', 'contradiction', 'terms', 'when', 'remember', 'sci-fi', 'definition', 'weird', 'stuff', 'What', 'have', 'do', 'come', 'up', 'vehicle', 'can', 'impress', 'middle', 'school', 'market', 'population', 'segment', 'built-in', 'sneer', 'collective', 'face', 'have', 'captain', 'who', 'aging', 'dreamboat', 'foxy', 'Vulcan', 'who', 'requisite', 'regal', 'beauty', 'Tac', 'Officer', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'descendant', '007', 'Texan', 'good', 'ole', 'boy', 'chief', 'engineer', 'doc', 'alien', 'who', 'avuncular', 'can', 'easily', 'imagine', 'tweed', 'glen', 'plaid', 'Maybe', 'was', 'George', 'Dubya', 'Bush', 'who', 'killed', 'off', 'segment', 'Trek', 'franchise', 'went', 'when', 'former', 'President', 'began', 'be', 'most', 'venomously', 'hated', 'Engineer', 'Trip', 'Tucker', 'initially', 'most', 'likable', 'character', 'here', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'old', 'truism', 'consumerism', 'something', 'can', 'take', 'dog', 'dropping', 'roll', 'confectioner', 'sugar', 'still', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'pastry', 'item', ""'ll"", 'be', 'sugar-coated', 'dog', 'dropping']",N/A

929664,A1QWWT367BZC9D,B000AOEMXM,Shellie,"[6, 13]","When I first watched the beginning of  ""Enterprise"" on television, I was at first rather dismayed. What is this musak? Where is the Star Trek title? And the jingoistic patriotism! It was soo unlike what has gone before, and not in an especially good way. Having said that; I have found the show itself thoroughly enjoyable, entertaining and as always with Star Trek optimistic and hopeful for a brighter and more tolerant future. With time I have become rather fond of Star Trek: Enterprise, the adventures of Captain Jonathan Archer and his brave, bold and daring crew.I do have some problem with Star Treks predictable and formulaic approach, such as; the name of a ship is nearly always Enterprise, why not the Endeavour or the Discovery? And surely it would have been a good gesture to all the devoted Star Trek fans around the world to have included a foreign actor or actress in the Enterprise cast, other than the usual Americans or Brits; an Australian, a European or an Indian for example? But an even more significant issue to me as a bisexual woman, I feel saddened that there hasn't yet been a character in any Star Trek series who is from a sexual or gender minority. While there have been a handful of episodes that subtly addressed queer issues they were few and far between, and yes, one such episode was included in Enterprise. But of all the shows on television Star Trek in particular had no excuse whatsoever to not tackle this issue head on, I mean The United Federation of Planets is meant to be cosmopolitan and diverse isn't it? Well I for one seriously doubt an enlightened organization such as this would exclude people solely based on their sexual orientation or gender identity; and feel that this topical issue should have been addressed by the makers of Star Trek if they wanted the franchise to remain relevant to a postmodern audience, oh well. I firmly believe that if Gene Roddenberry was still alive today the subject of a transgender, gay, lesbian or bi character being included somewhere in the Star Trek universe would have been breached in a positive, tasteful and embracing way many years ago. I also think that during season three Enterprise becomes a little too gung-ho and brash, and that this really isn't in keeping with the peaceable Star Trek ethos. But I do realize that Star Trek: Enterprise is set at the beginning of humanities true exploration of space; and that the crew does not yet have a Prime Directive to guide their actions, so they make many honest mistakes. I particularly felt that the Xindi threat in this series was a fairly direct criticism of the Bush Administrations handling of 911; in that in the end it's not brute force that solves the problem, but diplomacy and cooperation with moderate Xindi factions. With time The United Federation of Planets will be founded to bring many of the disparate and warring species of our quadrant of space together in a spirit of cooperation and mutual benefit, and in this sadly underrated series the Enterprise NX-01 crew will play a vital role in its eventual foundation. So despite these misgivings (which by the way are more concerned with the Star Trek franchise as a whole) I have absolutely loved watching Enterprise and have really looked forward to each new episode, throughout all four seasons.The scriptwriting and production design of Enterprise was, as with all Star Trek series, impeccable and tasteful; with thought provoking stories and close attention paid to the details of the sleekly stylish sets and props, to the moody and dramatic lighting and cool special effects, or the beautiful costumes and the look of the aliens. I also think that Enterprise had a grittier and more realistic take on the Trek universe than the other series, but of course, it is much closer in time to our era than the other series. The well chosen cast is made up of talented actors that keep you emotionally engaged; and make you care what happens to their respective characters, and little Porthos is soo adorable! All these elements combined make Enterprise addictive viewing, and are what set it apart from other television shows in this ever popular genre. So what a damn shame that it's been cancelled after only four short seasons, and all the more so, just as it was getting its space legs! I think that in an era when television is increasingly being dumbed down a show like Enterprise was actually needed more than ever; for it could at times be quite intelligent, and sometimes even extremely moving. So like many other trekkies I feel incredibly annoyed at the Paramount Executives for canceling Star Trek: Enterprise, and truly believe that they've made a rash error of judgement. I mean surely it would have been a wiser decision to let the show run its full course of seven seasons, and then, to have waited a while to see if there's still a market for a further Star Trek series?The sleek silver plastic casing that the DVDs come in is truly elegant and stylish, I just wish there had been three more of them! The special features are fantastic too, for with animated menus they provide hours of behind the scenes info and trivia that gives one a deeper appreciation of what goes into the making of a series like Enterprise. As fans we should thank the heavens for DVD so that the valiant but ill-fated Star Trek: Enterprise will at least be saved for posterity as a valuable and treasured part of the Star Trek canon. So if you consider yourself an avid trekkie I think Star Trek: Enterprise should definitely be on your wishlist if you plan to collect the various Trek series on DVD; as for the obsessive completist like myself, I would not have it otherwise!",5,An Enterprising Star Trek Series,1184544000,"07 16, 2007",2007,5681,"['When', 'first', 'watched', 'beginning', 'Enterprise', 'television', 'was',

Now, after watching every show it is my favorite Star Trek, and I think whoever made the decision to end it should be smacked, then fired, then smacked again. (Security!)I still do not like Scott Bakula as the Captain. I kept waiting for that other dude to show up and tell him he had to wear a dress to fix the time continium (Quantum Leap).I realize that playing a captain that is supposed have noone elses experiences to have learned from has got to be tough. But its like Scott was trying to hard.Connor Trinneer could have been likeable as a character if it weren't for his country accent. That kept pulling me out of the story. I am supposed to believe that they still have red necks in that year??? ... and that he is an engineer on a starship?? Who came up with that character??Jolene Blalock - T'Pol OH MY @#%$!!! That woman is HOT!!!Georgous!!! FINE!!! She played T'Pol very well. Even before we knew of T'Pol's affliction/addiction she seemed tired, not herself. When we find out about her little problem it all makes sense. And she is HOT! Someone please tell her to put out an exercise video. How did she get her stomach to look so tight? And she is HOT!Linda Park was an interesting part of the crew as Hoshi. She played her well I thought, and brought an angle to the show that I didn't expect. Building the first data base that future translaters would build on is just plain cool. She was very sexy in the last few shows. I think she could have been allowed to be a little cuter during the whole series, but she definately made up for it at the end.Reguardless of what some of the other reviews say the storys were very well written if you see the whole series. Each story built on top of the last, and you found out that the little missions that they did were part of a bigger concern that was coming.I was kinda sad when I got to the last show. These guys didnt get a real chance. If Deep Space 9 got seven seasons, these guys should have gotten 10. I mean DS9 is STUCK in one place. How stupid a concept that is. Enterprise was doing what Star Trek is famous for. Going out there and meeting new races, dealing with problems and situations that no one has come against before and over coming them. That is the essence of Star Trek. That is what Enterprise did VERY well.Toward the end it seems that they are trying desperately to save their show. Sexier outfits etc. What ruined this show like all good Sci-Fi shows is IGNORANT programming directors who slot the shows in horrible spots, then move them, then move them again. All the while not advertising them. I kid you not, I never knew this show existed until I saw and bought the boxed set! Does that tell you what a horrible job they do advertising Sci-Fi shows?If I ran the Sci-Fi channel I would get rid of all the black and white twilight zones and junk, and put some REAL shows on, like this one, BSG, Farscape, etc.I think all Sci-Fi fans somewhere deep inside think that by watching/reading Sci-Fi in some way we will be better prepared for the future and the adventure that will come. If we didn't have a little imagination, we wouldn't enjoy Sci-Fi. Enterprise came up against some new situations. I will have to use some of those tricks should I ever find myself face to face with an emotional half dressed Vulcan girl. (Just incase).In short.1. Battlestar Galactica2.

They dragged out the time travel element in some stories for far too long.  It should have been resolved in one season.In season 3 it is indeed basically a serial story with 2 dozen or so chapters.  I won't name episodes to avoid spoiling.  Especially good were the harsh elements, like the captain's forcible taking of new engine parts, the torture of Hoshi, and the death of the clone.The 4th season was like movie time with all the 2 and 3 part episodes connecting the history of the universe together.  The series finale wasn't worthy of watching, with the exception of the crew getting their due reward from the new federation.  The next generation duo made the episode as dull as watching home movies.  Someone elses home movies at that!Visually, the 60's technology of the original series hardly looked as if it could follow Enterprise.I would like to suggest that there is nothing in this series (except perhaps for the alien damage to north america in the season 3 opener) that wouldn't fit into the new alternate timeline of the 2009 movie.

929670,A2QO1SK1K1E04Z,B000AOEMXM,"Trash Winters ""Disease of the Age""","[0, 1]","I first saw the pilot episode of Star Trek: Enterprise shortly after it came out. My first reaction was ""this is not Star Trek,"" in spite of the nods given to previous continuity by establishing the character of Zephram Cochrane as an important recurring mention in the series. My second reaction was to intensely dislike the characters. It was obvious that the series' creators were going for a Kirk, Spock and McCoy dynamic with the characters of Archer, Tripp, and T'Pol. However, Archer, Tripp and T'Pol simply came across as less likable imitations of these characters. All three of these characters came across as irritating and obnoxious, whereas Kirk/Spock/McCoy presented comfortable, charming, banter. Additionally, the acting left much to be desired. I remember having a similar impression when I later caught reruns on television: some of the storylines were incredibly cheesy and even stupid, though the episodes of every Star Trek show admittedly riddled with stinkers here and the. However, in general, the writing was repetitive and one got the feeling that the scripts were badly in need of an editor.Since then I have begun watching the third and fourth seasons of Enterprise on Netflix and realized that the series, in spite of often problematically bad acting and poor writing, does have its share of engaging story arcs. The fourth season in particular provides what fans wanted all along, tying the series in with the other series in the franchise but also doing so in the context of story lines that are equally accessible to non-fans. ""Terra Prime,"" ""Demons,"" ""Through a Mirror, Darkly,"" and ""Stormfront, Part I and II"" are all examples of standout episodes in an otherwise mediocre series. Indeed, the fourth season is particularly strong, surprisingly so for a series which is three fourths tiring, inaccessible, poorly written drivel, and one fourth engaging storylines and character development. Additionally, the fourth season also becomes considerably more topical and relevant to the years in which the series aired. In the second and third seasons, we see an analogue for 9/11, though this is used to give the series a distinctly non-Star Trek like shift to the right of the political spectrum. However, the series is no longer a one sided tale of heroic American-anologues defeating alien/foreign terrorists by the fourth season. In the fourth season, the topic of post-9/11 xenophobia is addressed, as well as the theme that terrorists are not necessarily foreigners: anyone filled with enough hatred to commit acts of political violence can be a terrorist, including those purportedly on your own side in the clash of civilizations. Had the series begun with the episodes presented in the fourth season instead of the tripe that made up the first and second seasons of the show, perhaps this series would not have been cancelled.",3,Difficult to come to terms with,1356220800,"12 23, 2012",2012,2864,"['first', 'saw', 'pilot', 'episode', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Enterprise', 'shortly', 'came', 'out', 'first', 'reaction', 'was', 'not', 'Star', 'Trek', 'spite', 'nods', 'given', 'previous', 'continuity', 'establishing', 'character', 'Zephram', 'Cochrane', 'important', 'recurring', 'mention', 'series', 'second', 'reaction', 'was', 'intensely', 'dislike', 'characters', 'was', 'obvious', 'series', 'creators', 'were', 'going', 'Kirk', 'Spock', 'McCoy', 'dynamic', 'characters', 'Archer', 'Tripp', ""T'Pol"", 'However', 'Archer', 'Tripp', ""T'Pol"", 'simply', 'came', 'less', 'likable', 'imitations', 'characters', 'three', 'characters', 'came', 'irritating', 'obnoxious', 'whereas', 'Kirk/Spock/McCoy', 'presented', 'comfortable', 'charming', 'banter', 'Additionally', 'acting', 'left', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'remember', 'having', 'similar', 'impression', 'when', 'later', 'caught', 'reruns', 'television', 'storylines', 'were', 'incredibly', 'cheesy', 'even', 'stupid', 'episodes', 'Star', 'Trek', 'show', 'admittedly', 'riddled', 'stinkers', 'here', 'However', 'general', 'writing', 'was', 'repetitive', 'one', 'got', 'feeling', 'scripts', 'were', 'badly', 'need', 'editor.Since', 'then', 'have', 'begun', 'watching', 'third', 'fourth', 'seasons', 'Enterprise', 'Netflix', 'realized', 'series', 'spite', 'often', 'problematically', 'bad', 'acting', 'poor', 'writing', 'have', 'share', 'engaging', 'story', 'arcs', 'fourth', 'season', 'particular', 'what', 'fans', 'wanted', 'tying', 'series', 'other', 'series', 'franchise', 'also', 'doing', 'so', 'context', 'story', 'lines', 'are', 'equally', 'accessible', 'non-fans', 'Terra', 'Prime', 'Demons', 'Mirror', 'Darkly', 'Stormfront', 'Part', 'II', 'are', 'examples', 'standout', 'episodes', 'otherwise', 'mediocre', 'series', 'Indeed', 'fourth', 'season', 'particularly', 'strong', 'surprisingly', 'so', 'series', 'three', 'fourths', 'tiring', 'inaccessible', 'poorly', 'written', 'drivel', 'one', 'fourth', 'engaging', 'storylines', 'character', 'development', 'Additionally', 'fourth', 'season', 'also', 'considerably', 'more', 'topical', 'relevant', 'years', 'series', 'aired', 'second', 'third', 'seasons', 'see', 'analogue', '9/11', 'used', 'give', 'series', 'distinctly', 'non-Star', 'Trek', 'shift', 'right', 'political', 'spectrum', 'However', 'series', 'no', 'longer', 'one', 'sided', 'tale', 'heroic', 'American-anologues', 'defeating', 'alien/foreign', 'terrorists', 'fourth', 'season', 'fourth', 'season', 'topic', 'post-9/11', 'xenophobia', 'addressed', 'as', 'well', 'theme', 'terrorists', 'are', 'not', 'necessarily', 'foreigners', 'anyone', 'filled', 'enough', 'hatred', 'commit', 'acts', 'political', 'violence', 'can', 'be', 'terrorist', 'including', 'purportedly', 'own', 'side', 'clash', 'civilizations', 'Had', 'series', 'begun', 'episodes', 'presented', 'fourth', 'season', 'instead', 'tripe', 'made', 'up', 'first', 'second', 'seasons', 'show', 'perhaps', 'series', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'cancelled']",N/A
