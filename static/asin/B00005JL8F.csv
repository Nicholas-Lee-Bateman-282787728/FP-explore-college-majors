596625,A3UT41TWD7N0D5,B00005JL8F,AbeStreet,"[26, 33]","I have written a lenghthy review of this film @ IMDB.com which contains comparisons between the book and the movie.  I will not repeat that review here.  I don't want to put spoilers about the film in this review because I tried that before and Amazon.com would not post my review.  So as not to violate the Amazon.com policy regarding spoilers.  I will review the book and then comment on the movie.THE SUM OF ALL FEARS is a critical book in the Jack Ryan time line.  In the book Jack is the Deputy Director of Intelligence and holds one of the highest positons in the CIA.  The book then plots the middle eastern terrorists plans.  It also goes into great depth to show the relationship between Jack, the President and the Presidents national security advisor.  Agent Spinnaker the Russian spy helps to add to conflict as he feeds the CIA false data that will hopefully result in his becoming Russias new leader.  Most importantly Jack forms an alliance with the Vice President Darling that will lead to Jack becoming Vice President after Darling becomes President in DEBT OF HONOR (DOH).  After that Jack becomes President in EXECUTIVE ORDERS (EO).Next to THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER this is my favorite Clancy novel.  This story has it all.  It shows what a truely gifted writer Clancy is but then we come to the movie version of the book.  I don't know how Clancy could support this baztardization of his book.  Except for a nuclear weapon going off in the U.S. there are almost no other similarities between the book and the movie.  And because Ben Affleck has assumed the role of Jack Ryan it is almost impossible to Make DOH or EO.  In order to be President or Vice President the individual must be over 35 years old.  Ben who was in his late 20's when this was made has a way to go yet.I understand that people who have not read the book may think that this film is okay but that is not who buys the majority of the tickets for the film.  It is the fans of Clancy and the novel that buy the tickets.  This movie had a built in fan base and Clancy along with the producers for this movie betrayed that base.  I will never understand why Hollywood continues to make movies based on the popularity of a book and then changes the movie so drastically that it no longer adheres to the book itself.  While movies such as TSOAF may generate some inital dollars it will not stand the test of time.  Movies such as THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING and THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION which remained faithful to the books from which they were taken will stand the test of time and continue to generate dollars for the author and the producers.  If this DVD has a commentary track on it I would like to hear the excuses they come up with for all the changes to the storyline.Lastly, if you saw the trailer for this movie you saw the best parts of the film. There are very few noteworthy special effects.  The nuclear detonation in THE PEACEMAKERS was better than the detonation in this film.  The brief scene of Russian fighter attacking a U.S. aircraft carrier only lasted as long the same scene in the trailer.  What the viewer is treated to is too much of is Jack (Ben Aflleck) Ryan's dumbfounded expressions as he wanders from scene to scene.",1,Clancy & the films producers sell out!!!!!!!,1030060800,"08 23, 2002",2002,3228,"['have', 'written', 'lenghthy', 'review', 'film', '@', 'IMDB.com', 'comparisons', 'book', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'repeat', 'review', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'put', 'spoilers', 'film', 'review', 'tried', 'Amazon.com', 'would', 'not', 'post', 'review', 'So', 'not', 'violate', 'Amazon.com', 'policy', 'regarding', 'spoilers', 'will', 'review', 'book', 'then', 'comment', 'movie.THE', 'SUM', 'ALL', 'FEARS', 'critical', 'book', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'time', 'line', 'book', 'Jack', 'Deputy', 'Director', 'Intelligence', 'one', 'highest', 'positons', 'CIA', 'book', 'then', 'middle', 'eastern', 'terrorists', 'plans', 'also', 'great', 'depth', 'show', 'relationship', 'Jack', 'President', 'Presidents', 'national', 'security', 'advisor', 'Agent', 'Spinnaker', 'Russian', 'spy', 'add', 'conflict', 'CIA', 'false', 'data', 'will', 'hopefully', 'result', 'becoming', 'Russias', 'new', 'leader', 'Most', 'importantly', 'Jack', 'alliance', 'Vice', 'President', 'Darling', 'will', 'lead', 'Jack', 'becoming', 'Vice', 'President', 'Darling', 'President', 'DEBT', 'OF', 'HONOR', 'DOH', 'Jack', 'President', 'EXECUTIVE', 'ORDERS', 'EO', '.Next', 'THE', 'HUNT', 'FOR', 'RED', 'OCTOBER', 'favorite', 'Clancy', 'novel', 'story', 'what', 'truely', 'gifted', 'writer', 'Clancy', 'then', 'come', 'movie', 'version', 'book', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'Clancy', 'could', 'support', 'baztardization', 'book', 'nuclear', 'weapon', 'going', 'off', 'U.S.', 'are', 'almost', 'other', 'similarities', 'book', 'movie', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'assumed', 'role', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'almost', 'impossible', 'Make', 'DOH', 'EO', 'order', 'be', 'President', 'Vice', 'President', 'individual', 'must', 'be', '35', 'years', 'old', 'Ben', 'who', 'was', 'late', '20', 'when', 'was', 'made', 'way', 'go', 'yet.I', 'understand', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'may', 'think', 'film', 'okay', 'not', 'who', 'majority', 'tickets', 'film', 'fans', 'Clancy', 'novel', 'buy', 'tickets', 'movie', 'had', 'built', 'fan', 'base', 'Clancy', 'producers', 'movie', 'betrayed', 'base', 'will', 'never', 'understand', 'why', 'Hollywood', 'make', 'movies', 'based', 'popularity', 'book', 'then', 'movie', 'so', 'drastically', 'no', 'longer', 'book', 'movies', 'such', 'TSOAF', 'may', 'generate', 'inital', 'dollars', 'will', 'not', 'stand', 'test', 'time', 'Movies', 'such', 'THE', 'FELLOWSHIP', 'THE', 'RING', 'THE', 'SHAWSHANK', 'REDEMPTION', 'remained', 'faithful', 'books', 'were', 'taken', 'will', 'stand', 'test', 'time', 'continue', 'generate', 'dollars', 'author', 'producers', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'track', 'would', 'like', 'hear', 'excuses', 'come', 'up', 'changes', 'storyline.Lastly', 'saw', 'trailer', 'movie', 'saw', 'best', 'parts', 'film', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'noteworthy', 'special', 'effects', 'nuclear', 'detonation', 'THE', 'PEACEMAKERS', 'was', 'better', 'detonation', 'film', 'brief', 'scene', 'Russian', 'fighter', 'attacking', 'U.S.', 'aircraft', 'carrier', 'only', 'lasted', 'long', 'same', 'scene', 'trailer', 'What', 'viewer', 'treated', 'too', 'much', 'Jack', 'Ben', 'Aflleck', 'Ryan', 'dumbfounded', 'expressions', 'scene', 'scene']",N/A

596629,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B00005JL8F,Acute Observer,"[3, 3]","It appears that in 1973 Israel lost a jet that had a nuclear bomb but couldn't recover it. It is found and sold for salvage by someone who recognizes its value. Jack Ryan (played by a too young Ben Affleck) is working for the Director of the CIA and dating a surgical student. Ryan visits Russia to inspect nuclear decommissioning, and we see other events. A new premier comes to power in Russia. There is an attack on a city in Chechnya, and the US President Fowler wants to send in ""peace-keepers"" to occupy this rebellious province. A secret organization is found in a military base, and the CIA sends in an agent to investigate. They find the ""package"" is on a freighter bound for Baltimore. The Fascists want to provoke a war between Russian and America; if each knocks out the other a new world order will arise. A nuclear bomb explodes in Baltimore. Are you following this?Next a report that an ICBM has hit Moscow, and the Russians plan to sink an American aircraft carrier in the North Sea (!). A de facto state of war now exists. But they find out the plutonium in the Baltimore bomb came from the US (its ""DNA""). Jack Ryan drives to the warehouse to track the records. Ryan gets to communicate with the Russian Premier, and is able to halt the escalation to nuclear war. And so the World is saved once again. The ""hotline"" that was installed by JFK in 1963 proves its worth. The Fascist plotters are tracked down and neutralized. A new peace treaty is signed.A long and complex novel can be translated to film. It is not simplified, too many details can complicate the story. To be plausible, a story should not have glaringly false details (like a nuclear attack).

596630,A3JXOXKWOIETIY,B00005JL8F,"Adam Bernstein ""sixtiesuniverse""","[3, 6]","This film is based on the Tom Clancy novel, is a big budget blockbuster, and is pretty much worthless.  The plot itself has some major flaws, but the main qualm one has is though the actors and scriptwriters are paid millions here, the high budget ironically cheapens the film.  The actors speak their lines very quickly and very loudly, Ben Affleck is one of those everyman megastars, but with no real talent to warrant the stardom.Morgan Freeman, a great actor, has made some real junk lately from ""Deep Impact"" to this one.  And Pragna Desai is obviously more intelligent than the lines she is given: ""Yawn...double yawn"".  Liev Schreiber was good as usual as a CIA operative.But the most laughable aspect is certain parts of the plot.  Okay I'll accept that Israel was dumb enough to let a nuclear bomb get lost in the desert.  I'll accept that some Arabs found it and sold it.  What I won't accept is that Russian scientists would help Neonazis make the bomb operational, or even the ""reasoning"" of the Nazis.  Namely to get the Russians and the Americans to fight each other as ""times have changed"".  Really?So the Cold War didn't really happen?  And the one Nazi with qualms tells the others he is out(what does he think will happen?)But most incredible of all is the top advisor tells the President, ""If they did this to make a point to stay out of Chechnya...""  Yes, you heard that right.  I mean I know in real life Presidencial advisors are dumb, but Russia nukes us to say stay out of Chechnya??!!  So the President authorizes full scale nuclear war based on hearsay.

596631,A2DRHY9HJ4DE1F,B00005JL8F,Ahmed,"[1, 2]","The film may start at a slow pace but it gains excitement as it gets to the plot-which is as follows!The Story: based on one of Clancy's most famous novels, Affleck plays a CIA agent Ryan. It's his job to stop the conflict or rather the conflict that's going to be created. Powerful Nuclear weapons have fallen into the hands of terrorists who want to start a war (and not a cold war) between Russia and the United States. The President doesn't trust a lot of people. He calls for Affleck (Ryan) and Freeman (Cabot). It's up to them to avoid the conflict from taking place.Basic: In total receiving over $110,000,000 at the box-office this great thriller is a must-watch. It's exciting has a great story and a great cast ensemble. Robinson is a good director as this movie reveals. Affleck and Freeman should come on as an on-screen duo more often!Who'd like this?: If you usually like war type flicks or X-files type flicks you might like this. It's also for all ""I love trouble"", ""Good will Hunting"", and ""Pearl Harbour"" fans.Recommendation and why: I enjoyed this but everybody might not. It's as good as the ""Minority report"". It has a good plot and a good script. It's not an ironic-coincidence type story.  It's intelligent and interesting! It builds suspense and tends to surprise us now and then.

596635,A1A87TUBBDPMF0,B00005JL8F,"Alex Diaz-Granados ""fardreaming writer""","[4, 5]","(this is a corrected version of a review I posted)The Sum of All Fears, the fourth entry in the Jack Ryan film series, may be perhaps the hardest to assess objectively.Viewed purely as a stand-alone action thriller, Sum of All Fears is an above average effort, ranking just below Executive Decision and way above Under Siege 2.  In spite of a tight budget, Phil Alden Robinson (Field of Dreams, Hackers) delivers a post-September 11 cautionary note about terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, and the acting by Ben Affleck, James Cromwell, Morgan Freeman, L. Schreiber, and the others in this ensemble cast is top-notch.  While certainly not flawless, Paul Attanasio and Daniel Pyne's screenplay doesn't try to insult the audience's intelligence by going the James Bond route and having the hero stop the detonation of the bomb and catching the bad guys on his own.  And one has to admire the production staff and cinematographer for maintaining the illusion that this movie does indeed span three continents when it was actually shot mostly in Canada (with the California desert briefly but convincingly doubling for the Middle East).Viewed as a Tom Clancy adaptation, however, one is left to wonder why Mace Neufeld - the producer who bought the film rights to Clancy's fiction - couldn't have made this film earlier while Harrison Ford was still interested in the Ryan role.  As I have said in earlier reviews of these Clancy-based movies, screenwriters have an almost impossible labor when they adapt a thick Clancy novel into a 120 page screenplay.  What makes Clancy's novels compelling to his fans - the large storyline with subplots and secondary characters that are developed further in other novels - doesn't always translate well to the silver screen.  This is true of every Clancy novel-turned-into-film, but the novel that has been altered the most has been Sum of All Fears, and the changes are pretty radical.As most of Clancy's readers are aware, the novels' progression has mostly been centered on Ryan's rise from CIA analyst to (albeit accidentally) President of the United States.  The Sum of All Fears (the book) is the mid-journey transition, where the events at the end will lead to the searing climax of Debt of Honor.  By taking Jack Ryan back in time to the start of his CIA career (and by pretending the other movies don't exist), Neufeld, Attanasio, Pyne, Robinson (and to some degree Clancy himself, since he has an executive producing credit here) have made a hash of this idea.  To what extent Harrison Ford's loss of interest in the Ryan role was involved I can't say.  I am merely a movie watcher and not an insider (otherwise my reviews would be in the papers and not here gratis), but although Affleck is acceptable as a replacement, Ford's reliability, maturity, and steadiness are sorely missed.  Not only that, but by setting the story in 2002 (albeit in a Tom Clancy parallel universe where George W. Bush has been replaced by Robert Fowler), gone is the near-end-of-the-Cold-War urgency that made the novel so suspenseful.  (In one of those bizarre coincidences or flukes of history, the hardcover was released a few days before the failed coup against Gorbachev back in August of 1991!)Not only that, but the novel's cast of villains (an ex-East German terrorist, an ex-Stasi officer, an insane Native American criminal, several radical Palestinians, and a secret supporter) has been replaced by, Ach du lieber Gott, a group of neo-Nazis!  Yes, Alan Bates makes a dapper and almost charming Nazi...in a sense he fares better here than Gregory Peck's hammy performance as Josef Mengele in The Boys from Brazil.  But although I could buy the premise of Black Sunday with Nukes in the novel and could see the blind spot of the villains' plan (okay, the nuke explodes and the USA and USSR wipe each other off the map...and radiation and fallout ruin the northern hemisphere), but in the novel the characters are so bent on revenge (one is dying of cancer anyway, so he doesn't care about the aftermath) that the fatal flaw of their plan is not evident.  Bates' Dressler, however, surely knows - as do his other apparently rich, educated, and old colleagues - that a nuclear exchange between America and Russia will also harm the Europe he is supposedly doing this insanity for.  Anderson says (in the making-of featurette) that the change of villains was forced on the writers by the lack of plausibility of the book's weird mix of German, Native American, and Palestinian conspirators.  I think Paramount and Neufeld simply feared criticism from Arab-Americans here and international audiences abroad, particularly in the wake of 9/11.Other oddities in the film involve the military details.  How does that Russian Backfire bomber squadron find that American carrier on its own?  Why is the carrier shown to be almost defenseless? In the real world, that carrier  (USS Theodore Roosevelt, from her CVN 74 pennant number) would have had an F-14 combat air patrol up, as well as a ring of escorting cruisers and destroyers.  How do the Russians know that B-2A Spirits have taken off from Aviano AB in Italy (they would have been based in Whiteman AFB in Missouri, but never mind)?  And just what kind of radar do the Russians have that can spot a B-2 anyway?Still, the movie does work, quirkily.  It has some really good bits, particularly the scenes with its two leading actors, Affleck and Freeman. Scheiber is actually a more interesting John Clark than the somewhat villainous looking Willem Dafoe (who played Clark in Clear and Present Danger).  James Cromwell, too, fares well as the frazzled President who, when push comes to shove, almost cracks under the strain of the crisis that the Neo-Nazis have unleashed.",3,"A Fear-ful Chiller, But is

596637,A10WCSGF78M2KE,B00005JL8F,Alfonso A.,"[16, 22]","Jack Ryan isn't getting older. And he isn't getting better. He's getting younger and he's turned into Ben Affleck, who is probably as good as Alec Baldwin (Ryan No. 1) but can't hope to match the crusty cool of Harrison Ford (Ryan No. 2).The latest Ryan movie, ""The Sum of All Fears,"" is based on Tom Clancy's sixth novel, written in 1991. The chronology may strike the casual observer as a bit skewed. Apparently, ""Sum"" is a kind of prequel that takes Ryan back to his days as a feckless CIA rookie. It shows him merely dating Cathy (Bridget Moynahan), who will become his future wife (Anne Archer in the Ford films).Yet, this movie is taking place in the present and that would mean...Oh, never mind. Let's all do the Time Warp again and let it go.Anyway, Ryan is a greenhorn analyst whose particular expertise - he wrote a paper on a Russian official named Alexander Nemerov(Ciaran Hinds) - is now in great demand because Nemerov has just become the new president of Russia. Recruited by CIA director William Cabot (Morgan Freeman), Ryan quickly finds himself behind some very powerful closed doors, talking strategy with President Fowler (a very credible James Cromwell) and his top aides (Philip Baker Hall, Ron Rifkin and Bruce McGill).Meanwhile, a neo-Nazi (Alan Bates) has acquired a nuclear bomb, which he plans to use to start a war between Russia and the U.S. The idea is first to detonate the bomb at the Super Bowl in Baltimore, which the President is attending, and then rachet up the tension until the U.S. is convinced Nemerov is on the attack, and the two countries blow each other into oblivion.The bomb goes off - a harrowing sequence depicting a supposed low-level ""dirty bomb"" done in desaturated colors that shows us a very bleak Baltimore - isn't what the movie is about; it's about the aftermath. The confusion (particularly at the highest levels of government), the terror and, especially, the compassion as everyone tries to take care of everyone else.Which, of course, echoes the confusion, terror and compassion that really happened on Sept. 11. That shocking moment in history is inevitably intertwined with any movie offering this kind of scenario. It may be too soon for some to watch.It may be just right for others. The nine months distance does help. Our collective horrified memory - and remember, this movie was finished befire 9/11 - gives some considerable emotional heft to what would otherwise be another routinely professonal Clancy thriller. This time last year, the idea of a a nuclear explosion in Baltimore would strike the average viewer as unlikely, as far-fetched as a killer meteor. Now such an event has a chilling possibility. Something very close to it has already happened and seeing it imagined gives the picture a resonance it could never have summoned on its own.""The Sum of All Fears"" is more of an ensemble piece than earlier Ryan adventures. Freeman continues to be a magic ingredient for any movie - like adding butter and sugar to most recipes. Cromwell brings dignity and humanity to a familiar part. After the explosion, he's not only enraged that someone attacked America but that ""they tried to kill me."" Liev Schreiber shows up as an expert field operative (originally played by Willem Dafoe). Typically a cerebral actor, he's surprisingly convincing in an action role.As for Affleck, he really isn't bad. His comic exchanges with Freeman are delightful and he can carry off the square-jawed-hero bit when called upon. But as movies like the recent ""Changing Lanes"" showed, he has a deft semi-comic touch. He should be playing some of the roles Hugh Grant turns down. The director, Phil Alden Robinson (""Field of Dreams""), isn't a conventional action director, but he handles the end-of-the-world stuff well. Plus, he brings a much-needed human dimension to the characters.Early Summer 2002 is shaping up to be all about comic-book heroes and George Lucas fantasies. That makes a good ol' Hollywood action flick even more welcome. ""The Sum of All Fears"" may not be super-smart, but it's rock-solid. And a fine way to spend a few hours out of the summer heat.",4,"Good, but familiar....",1022803200,"05 31, 2002",2002,4124,"['Jack', 'Ryan', ""n't"", 'getting', 'older', ""n't"", 'getting', 'better', 'getting', 'younger', 'turned', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'who', 'probably', 'as', 'good', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Ryan', 'No', '1', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hope', 'match', 'crusty', 'cool', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Ryan', 'No', '2', '.The', 'latest', 'Ryan', 'movie', 'Sum', 'All', 'Fears', 'based', 'Tom', 'Clancy', 'sixth', 'novel', 'written', '1991', 'chronology', 'may', 'strike', 'casual', 'observer', 'bit', 'skewed', 'Apparently', 'Sum', 'kind', 'prequel', 'Ryan', 'back', 'days', 'feckless', 'CIA', 'rookie', 'merely', 'dating', 'Cathy', 'Bridget', 'Moynahan', 'who', 'will', 'become', 'future', 'wife', 'Anne', 'Archer', 'Ford', 'films', '.Yet', 'movie', 'taking', 'place', 'present', 'would', 'mean', 'Oh', 'never', 'mind', 'Let', 'do', 'Time', 'Warp', 'again', 'let', 'go.Anyway', 'Ryan', 'greenhorn', 'analyst', 'particular', 'expertise', 'wrote', 'paper', 'Russian', 'official', 'named', 'Alexander', 'Nemerov', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'now', 'great', 'demand', 'Nemerov', 'just', 'become', 'new', 'president', 'Russia', 'Recruited', 'CIA', 'director', 'William', 'Cabot', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Ryan', 'quickly', 'very', 'powerful', 'closed', 'doors', 'talking', 'strategy', 'President', 'Fowler', 'very', 'credible', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'top', 'aides', 'Philip', 'Baker', 'Hall', 'Ron', 'Rifkin', 'Bruce', 'McGill', '.Meanwhile', 'neo-Nazi', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'acquired', 'nuclear', 'bomb', 'use', 'start', 'war', 'Russia', 'U.S', 'idea', 'first', 'detonate', 'bomb', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'Baltimore', 'President', 'attending', 'then', 'rachet', 'up', 'tension', 'U.S.', 'convinced', 'Nemerov', 'attack', 'two', 'countries', 'blow', 'other', 'oblivion.The', 'bomb', 'harrowing', 'sequence', 'depicting', 'supposed', 'low-level', 'dirty', 'bomb', 'done', 'desaturated', 'colors', 'very', 'bleak', 'Baltimore', ""n't"", 'what', 'movie', 'aftermath', 'confusion', 'particularly', 'highest', 'levels', 'government', 'terror', 'especially', 'compassion', 'everyone', 'take', 'care', 'everyone', 'else.Which', 'course', 'confusion', 'terror', 'compassion', 'really', 'happened', 'Sept.', '11', 'shocking', 'moment', 'history', 'inevitably', 'intertwined', 'movie', 'offering', 'kind', 'scenario', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'soon', 'watch.It', 'may', 'be', 'just', 'right', 'others', 'nine', 'months', 'distance', 'help', 'collective', 'horrified', 'memory', 'remember', 'movie', 'was', 'finished', 'befire', '9/11', 'considerable', 'emotional', 'heft', 'what', 'would', 'otherwise', 'be', 'routinely', 'professonal', 'Clancy', 'thriller', 'time', 'last', 'year', 'idea', 'nuclear', 'explosion', 'Baltimore', 'would', 'strike', 'average', 'viewer', 'unlikely', 'as', 'far-fetched', 'killer', 'meteor', 'Now', 'such', 'event', 'chilling', 'possibility', 'Something', 'very', 'close', 'already', 'happened', 'seeing', 'imagined', 'picture', 'resonance', 'could', 'never', 'have', 'summoned', 'own', 'Sum', 'All', 'Fears', 'more', 'ensemble', 'piece', 'earlier', 'Ryan', 'adventures', 'Freeman', 'be', 'magic', 'ingredient', 'movie', 'adding', 'butter', 'sugar', 'most', 'recipes', 'Cromwell', 'dignity', 'humanity', 'familiar', 'part', 'explosion', 'not', 'only', 'enraged', 'someone', 'attacked', 'America', 'tried', 'kill', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'up', 'expert', 'field', 'operative', 'originally', 'played', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Typically', 'cerebral', 'actor', 'surprisingly', 'convincing', 'action', 'role.As', 'Affleck', 'really', ""n't"", 'bad', 'comic', 'exchanges', 'Freeman', 'are', 'delightful', 'can', 'carry', 'off', 'square-jawed-hero', 'bit', 'when', 'called', 'upon', 'movies', 'recent', 'Changing', 'Lanes', 'showed', 'deft', 'semi-comic', 'touch', 'should', 'be', 'playing', 'roles', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'down', 'director', 'Phil', 'Alden', 'Robinson', 'Field', 'Dreams', ""n't"", 'conventional', 'action', 'director', 'end-of-the-world', 'stuff', 'well', 'much-needed', 'human', 'dimension', 'characters.Early', 'Summer', '2002', 'shaping', 'up', 'be', 'comic-book', 'heroes', 'George', 'Lucas', 'fantasies', 'good', 'ol', 'Hollywood', 'action', 'flick', 'even', 'more', 'welcome', 'Sum', 'All', 'Fears', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'super-smart', 'rock-solid', 'fine', 'way', 'spend', 'few', 'hours', 'summer', 'heat']",N/A

One other point that bugged me the whole movie, the time line of the film seemed to be in conflict with the Jack Ryan character.  A nuclear bomb is ""lost"" by Israel in 73 (a dumb premise to begin with) then some 29 years pass.  Ok, so the film is supposed to take place in the present or near future.  But Jack Ryan is a young kid, unmarried and just an unassuming analyst with the CIA.  I thought back when Jack Ryan saved the world in Hunt for Red October that he was just a young unassuming analyst with the CIA.  But he was married back then.  What time period did all that happen in?  I never read this book so maybe I got the timelines all screwed up, but I thought in the present or near future Jack Ryan time line that he was president of the United States already.

Ben Affleck has charm, sure, and he can act (to a degree) but both Harrison Ford and Alec Baldwin handled this character far better than Affleck, who appeared in most scenes to be out of his comfort zone.  I hear from devoted fans of the book (I've never read it) that the film is a huge disappointment in that it doesn't stay true and shifts many plot points to come across more conservative in lue of the time the film was made (so close to the 9/11 attacks).

""The sum of all fears"" is no exception, and shows how a determined partie with the right connections can begin a series of events that leads to a war with dire consequences. This film, although changing lots of plot, character and faction elements, keeps the main substance of the novel: Fear will tear us apart.Especially in europe we believe that we live in a state of grace and permanent peace, but it's so fragile that we must cherish it. This film and novel is really a cautionary tale.This Jack Ryan is a freshman in the CIA, not the hardened sub-director we're used to, and Ben Affleck fulfills the role quite well. Morgan Freeman is great as a top CIA executive; charismatic and with great leadership characteristics, easy stuff for such a good actor.Secondary roles like the russian president and the american operative are also well played, leaving their mark.The story itself as some ""reality checks"", like the secret services almost omnipotence, a walk in post nuclear bomb Baltimore, total discardance of nuclear Electro Magnetic Pulse (although the commentaries of Tom Clancy state that a small weapon probably would not knock out the entire network of com nods) or the fist fight with the big nazi (why????).Good entertainment with a message. Common sense and wisdom must always be present in politics, especially when we have weapons that can destroy us all.The extras in the DVD are quite good; explaining how was done the main scenes that required most special fx (like the effects of the explosion, or the A4 being shotdown); there are also interviews with the actors, and great commentaries from Tom Clancy (don't forget to watch this film a second time with the commentaries on - they should have hired Mr. clancy as an adviser...the film would be better).

I haven't read the Clancy books so I had no preconceived notions, but I have enjoyed the earlier Jack Ryan films with Harrison Ford, and I HAVE seen many supposed thrillers lately that were extremely disappointing.  This is the first thriller I've enjoyed in a long time.  I thought the script was very good, the acting from top to bottom was superb, and the editing kept the many plot threads clear.After Harrison Ford dropped out of this project and Ben Affleck expressed an interest in playing the lead, the script was revamped to show Jack Ryan at the beginning of his career.  In that capacity, as an intelligent neophyte, he meets his CIA mentor (Morgan Freeman), first ventures out with a seasoned field operative (Liev Schreiber), begins courting his future wife (Bridget Moynahan), advises the president (James Cromwell) for the first time, and meets the Russian president (Ciaran Hinds).  This is a very interesting time in the career of a beloved character, and the writers got it right and Affleck does a very good job here.  The villains are played by Alan Bates and Colm Feore.  What a fabulous cast!Special features include two commentary tracks - one with the director and cinematographer and one with the director and author; meaty featurettes about the casting, production and special effects; a trailer; an on-the-set featurette.  The film can be heard in English or French, and subtitles are available only in English.If you like exciting techno-thrillers and are not a Tom Clancy or Harrison Ford purist, give this film a chance.

Morgan Freeman plays his boss, William Cabot, formerly played by James Earl Jones. Big shoes to fill, but they do a great job.This movie is aptly named. It comes terribly close to all-out nuclear war. The story opens when, during the 1973 Israeli war, the Israeli army launches a single plane carrying a nuclear bomb, ""just in case."" It is shot down over the desert, and the sand covers the bomb. Twenty-nine years later (i.e., 2002, the date the movie was made), an Arab finds the bomb and sells it to a black market arms dealer, who buys it for $400, claiming it's not worth much. The Arab has no way of knowing it is nuclear, until much later when he is dying of radiation poisoning.In the meantime, Ryan and Cabot make an inspection tour of the Russian nuclear facilities to observe their dis-assembling of weapons pursuant to a treaty. They note that three nuclear scientists are missing, the Russians explain one is out sick, one is on vacation, one recently died in an automobile accident. Not true, discovers the canny CIA, and tries to find the missing scientists.Meanwhile, the arms dealer has sold the bomb, the plutonium was taken out and those three missing scientists built a new bomb with it. Then they were shot by the people they built it for so they could not talk.I won't give any more away, but Ryan is truly brilliant as he discovers what happened to the plutonium, and where it came from. However, he did not track it fast enough to keep it from being used to blow up a football stadium in Baltimore in which the President was a spectator. Fortunately, a warning got through to the president soon enough that he was in Air Force One when the bomb went off. Ryan, however, was in a helicopter. By the way, Ryan's girlfriend is a physician who works in a Baltimore hospital, so all the while he's running around trying to save the world, he doesn't know if she's alive or not.",4,The Title Fits: A Very Spine-Tingling Story,1337385600,"05 19, 2012",2012,1971,"['Ben', 'Affleck', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'CIA', 'analyst', 'formerly', 'played', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'boss', 'William', 'Cabot', 'formerly', 'played', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'Big', 'shoes', 'fill', 'do', 'great', 'job.This', 'movie', 'aptly', 'named', 'terribly', 'close', 'all-out', 'nuclear', 'war', 'story', 'when', '1973', 'Israeli', 'war', 'Israeli', 'army', 'single', 'plane', 'carrying', 'nuclear', 'bomb', 'just', 'case', 'shot', 'down', 'desert', 'sand', 'bomb', 'Twenty-nine', 'years', 'later', 'i.e.', '2002', 'date', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'Arab', 'bomb', 'black', 'market', 'arms', 'dealer', 'who', '400', 'claiming', 'not', 'worth', 'much', 'Arab', 'way', 'knowing', 'nuclear', 'much', 'later', 'when', 'dying', 'radiation', 'meantime', 'Ryan', 'Cabot', 'make', 'inspection', 'tour', 'Russian', 'nuclear', 'facilities', 'observe', 'dis-assembling', 'weapons', 'pursuant', 'treaty', 'note', 'three', 'nuclear', 'scientists', 'are', 'missing', 'Russians', 'explain', 'one', 'sick', 'one', 'vacation', 'one', 'recently', 'died', 'automobile', 'accident', 'Not', 'true', 'canny', 'CIA', 'tries', 'find', 'missing', 'scientists.Meanwhile', 'arms', 'dealer', 'sold', 'bomb', 'plutonium', 'was', 'taken', 'out', 'three', 'missing', 'scientists', 'built', 'new', 'bomb', 'Then', 'were', 'shot', 'people', 'built', 'could', 'not', 'talk.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'more', 'away', 'Ryan', 'truly', 'brilliant', 'what', 'happened', 'plutonium', 'where', 'came', 'However', 'did', 'not', 'track', 'fast', 'enough', 'keep', 'being', 'used', 'blow', 'up', 'football', 'stadium', 'Baltimore', 'President', 'was', 'spectator', 'Fortunately', 'warning', 'got', 'president', 'soon', 'enough', 'was', 'Air', 'Force', 'One', 'when', 'bomb', 'went', 'off', 'Ryan', 'however', 'was', 'helicopter', 'way', 'Ryan', 'girlfriend', 'physician', 'who', 'Baltimore', 'hospital', 'running', 'around', 'trying', 'save', 'world', ""n't"", 'know', 'alive', 'not']",N/A

What was Ben Affleck thinking when he signed on to star in the functional equivalent of  `Young Indiana Jones' to a role that has Harrison Ford's hefty paw-prints all over it? Even if the film were a faithful recreation of Tom Clancy's superb and thought-provoking thriller about what happens when an Arab extremist group gains possession of an Israeli nuclear weapon lost during the 1973 Yom Kippur War, which it is not, the ploy of giving Jack Ryan the time machine treatment is hokey at best, and ruinous at worst. Luckily, the script is so hackneyed and implausible at parts that it was downright silly.For example, Ryan is taking a helicopter ride when an atomic detonation occurs. The several kiloton blast knocks the chopper out of the sky, but Ryan survives. Right. The blast would have melted the chopper as it knocked it from the sky with a heat blast so intense nothing could have possibly survived.  But Hollywood can't kill off the Ryan franchise by pulling a Terminator-like turn and sending Ryan back into the past to get killed since that would prevent our boy Ben wouldn't mature into becoming Alex Baldwin, who then proceeds to save the free world in ""The Hunt For Red October"", set later in Ryan's career.  Got it? Me neither.Having said all that, had the main character's name not been Jack Ryan, and had I not already read the book and therefore arrived predisposed as to what it was that I was going to see dramatized, the film is not all that bad. As a techno-thriller, it is exciting, well photographed, and has a decent cast, including a charming Morgan Freeman (does this guy never take a vacation?) as Jack's Director of Counter Intelligence (DCI) connection. Lee Garlington is fetching and attractive as Jack's main squeeze, and Live Schreiber is particularly good as a young John Clark, a figure prominent in some of the later Clancy novels. The film is facts paced, has some interesting action sequences, and as an evening's entertainment is worth the watching. It is hardly in the caliber of films such as ""The Hunt For Red October"", ""Patriot Games"", or ""Clear And Present Danger"", but maybe Ben can try again when his paws grow a little with age.

DCI William Cabot (Morgan Freeman) said to just ""go ahead and tell her the truth"" so Jack does tell the truth and his girl (Bridget Moynahan) hangs up in frustration and disbelief.

These and many other plot wrinkles are uncomfortably pieced together in this wonky adaptation of Tom Clancy's latest novel, one that has been rewritten from the original source to have its main character Jack Ryan now a novice at the CIA instead of the tired professional played by Harrison Ford, in order to accommodate the casting of young Ben Affleck. Unfortunately, it hasn't been rewritten well, so instead of you getting the impression that filmmakers are now exploring the possibilities available in seeing this character before he could confidently make choices in his line of work, you mainly feel that it has been worked out this way merely as an excuse to have the young superstar in the role. Affleck is sturdy in the lead (which was originated by Alec Baldwin), as is the entire supporting cast around him (James Cromwell, Ron Rifkin, Philip Baker Hall and an excellent Ciaran Hinds as the Russian president are high points, while Bates performs with a stupid German accent that makes his dialogue impossible to understand every time he opens his mouth), but the film's climax is weak. The main centrepiece scene, that of a nuclear bomb exploding in Baltimore, is extremely impressive but badly timed. The story is more complex and impressive than any other Clancy work, but with a far too-relaxed Phil Alden Robinson directing it too many notches short of white-knuckle tight, it's a collection of great elements that just doesn't equal the sum of its parts.",2,"Too much plot, not enough sense",1041984000,"01 8, 2003",2003,1822,"['Israel', 'nuclear', 'bomb', 'long', 'thought', 'lost', 'desert', 'gone', 'missing', 'Russia', 'American', 'CIA', 'led', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'investigating', 'disappearance', 'three', 'atomic', 'scientists', 'Austria', 'neo-Nazi', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'head', 'scheme', 'start', 'war', 'Russia', 'USA', 'will', 'allow', 'party', 'supreme', 'rule', 'earth', 'many', 'other', 'plot', 'wrinkles', 'are', 'uncomfortably', 'pieced', 'together', 'wonky', 'adaptation', 'Tom', 'Clancy', 'latest', 'novel', 'one', 'been', 'rewritten', 'original', 'source', 'have', 'main', 'character', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'now', 'novice', 'CIA', 'instead', 'tired', 'professional', 'played', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'order', 'accommodate', 'casting', 'young', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Unfortunately', ""n't"", 'been', 'rewritten', 'well', 'instead', 'getting', 'impression', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'now', 'exploring', 'possibilities', 'available', 'seeing', 'character', 'could', 'confidently', 'make', 'choices', 'line', 'work', 'mainly', 'feel', 'been', 'worked', 'out', 'way', 'merely', 'excuse', 'have', 'young', 'superstar', 'role', 'Affleck', 'sturdy', 'lead', 'was', 'originated', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'entire', 'supporting', 'cast', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'Ron', 'Rifkin', 'Philip', 'Baker', 'Hall', 'excellent', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'Russian', 'president', 'are', 'high', 'points', 'Bates', 'performs', 'stupid', 'German', 'accent', 'dialogue', 'impossible', 'understand', 'time', 'mouth', 'film', 'climax', 'weak', 'main', 'centrepiece', 'scene', 'nuclear', 'bomb', 'exploding', 'Baltimore', 'extremely', 'impressive', 'badly', 'timed', 'story', 'more', 'complex', 'impressive', 'other', 'Clancy', 'work', 'far', 'too-relaxed', 'Phil', 'Alden', 'Robinson', 'directing', 'too', 'many', 'notches', 'short', 'white-knuckle', 'tight', 'collection', 'great', 'elements', 'just', ""n't"", 'equal', 'sum', 'parts']",N/A

The US thinks it is Russia and are prepared to retaliate.  The nuclear attack was in fact caused by a third party.  Here is the problem of the movie.In Clancy's original novel, the terrorists were anti-Israeli Islamic extremists.  Before the 09/11 tragedy, the movie decided to the politically correct route and replace the Islamic terrorists with facist Nazis.  Thus, thousands of Americans die by a nuclear bomb and the movie portrays it as the responsibility of only a few deranged Nazis.  In retrospect, the producers would have made a better movie by keeping the bad guys as the Islamic terrorists, but I don't think anyone would want to see that kind of movie.  It would be too realistic.So Sum of All Fears is a good movie that uses bad guys (Nazis) that aren't really a threat instead of someone like Al Queda, who are a threat, to get to the thrust of the movie.

596666,AGEJE3WH26UBR,B00005JL8F,BOB,"[33, 45]","&#65279;The challenge facing any screenwriter attempting to adapt a Clancy novel is what to cut from the massive tome to fit the two-hour film run-time limit that theater owners so desperately covet.For instance, the huge scope of ""Red October"" was cut to the bone, but just deftly enough to be a decent film. The plots of the other two (Clancy books made into films) actually lent themselves well to film adaptation.Also, in light of 9/11, a case could be made that ""Sum"" is Clancy's most terrifying and realistic novel, so great care should have been exercised in bringing this to the screen.The cinematic result, however, is so hackneyed, so utterly ludicrous, that what was supposed to be high drama and suspense delivers nothing to the devoted Clancy fan but utter disappointment.The film's first problem is the casting of Ben Affleck as Jack Ryan. Clancy's Jack Ryan is a CIA analyst, an intellectual who is always forced into reluctant action by circumstance.Affleck's portrayal of Ryan is nothing but the same wide-eyed, slack-jawed, one-note performance that he has phoned-in on every film he's ever done. Wherever he delivers any line concerning analysis of data, people or scenarios, Affleck is totally unbelievable as Ryan.At least Alec Baldwin, and especially Harrison Ford, correctly nailed the nuances of Ryan's character. But those guys are actors WITH chops, something Affleck is totally devoid of, and boy, is it obvious and ugly to watch.The second problem is the concession (to the Islamic community in this country) that the producers made of shifting the book's main protagonists from Islamic terrorists to Neo-Nazis. In one scene, the Nazi Big Cheese (the always wonderful, but here, totally wasted Alan Bates) reflects that Hitler was stupid for taking on the Russians and Americans instead of getting them to destroy each other. He plans to do just this by detonating a nuclear bomb on U.S. soil, and an associated rogue military act, to goad the two countries to full nuclear war and then rule the world afterward.In the book, the full-scale nuclear exchange scenario was not the design of the Islamic protagonist, but rather a horrifying extension of external circumstance surrounding the detonation of a terrorist's single atomic bomb. The film's revised premise is a terrible compromise that just makes no sense whatsoever: There wouldn't be much left to take over after a full nuke exchange between the U.S. and Russia.The film's biggest problem, however, is the script, which heaps contrivance upon contrivance, going from bad to worse as the film progresses.Examples: There is a jarring instant geographical shift of Ryan from the U.S. to a covert mission deep inside Russia with no explanation of how he got there; Ryan in downtown post-nuclear explosion Baltimore, clad in nothing but a sweater, with no apparent radiation/fallout after-effects; Ryan using the crashed helicopter radio that still functions after being EMP'd by the nuclear detonation (didn't the screenwriters do ANY research on the subject at all, or at least watch a ""Broken Arrow"" DVD?); Ryan utilizing his mentor's PDA (also exposed to the EMP but also still miraculously functioning) to communicate with the CIA's deepest mole inside the Kremlin (anybody at the CIA have a security problem with one of their own having a direct communication link to their highest level Russian source???!!!).And here's one for you: Ryan is running thru post-blast downtown Baltimore because he's chasing the bad guys who installed the bomb: Why would those guys still be in Baltimore? To hang out and roast radioactive weenies? No, it's because the screenwriters needed to set up a ridiculous fight scene with the personal bodyguard of the Nazi Big Cheese, who A.) had never been shown in the U.S. prior to this scene, and more importantly B.), WHY WOULD HE BE THERE WHEN HE KNOWS THE BOMB IS GOING TO DETONATE??!!And just when you think it's over, just when you thought it couldn't get any more ludicrous, the final scene is so silly that the writers should be locked up and never allowed near a Powerbook ever again.The wonderful supporting cast are the only redeeming thing this vapid clunker has to offer (once again, the magnificent Morgan Freeman rises above terrible material).Clancy himself is listed as exec producer of this croaker. Maybe not having enough cash to buy the Minnesota Vikings a few years ago was such a blow to his ego that he's willing to compromise the book he fashioned with such wondrous detail and imagination, just for the almighty buck.Geez, Tom, your fans, and especially Jack Ryan, deserve a WHOLE lot better.",1,DON'T SPEND ONE CENT ON THIS HORRIBLE ADAPTATION,1127520000,"09 24, 2005",2005,4633,"['65279',

596673,A3TD0DHQ4CFRDS,B00005JL8F,careful buyer,"[7, 9]","I went to see SUM this past weekend with a strange mixture of anticipation and ambivalence. I like Ben Affleck (but he is no Harrison Ford). I like Morgan Freeman (but he is no James Earl Jones). I like action movies (but usually find Tom Clancy too hardware and acronym obsessed). Doesn't a movie about terrorism (admittedly made before 9/11) trivialize a national tragedy?I don't think this movie works ... If the villians had been left Middle Eastern (as they were in the book),the producers might never have released the movie at all. If the theory is that this is just a movie and not an accidental documentary, it has to be different enough to make people comfortable watching it. Why do you think so many producers chose to eliminate scenes with the World Trade Center Towers after 9/11? Because seeing the WTC pulls the viewer into reality and destroys the momentum of the movie experience.The movie doesn't work because the plot developments in the first half of the movie are completely disregarded in the second half. Ben Affleck is completely convincing as the CIA desk jockey - some of the best scenes are those with his co-analysts and I can buy the language fluency and the research expertise. But his run through the burning streets of Baltimore and his fight with the terrorist on the docks just don't ring true. It feels too much like a staged fight, without weight or menace. I don't know what Harrison Ford's secret is, but you always feel that even though he is no super hero he has the guts or brawn to play out a violent encounter. Ben is still too ""light"" in action scenes. If there are going to be more Jack Ryan films (and Ben deserves another shot at this role), this needs seriously to be fixed.The technology-based part of the plot also has holes you could drive a tank through. The CIA director doesn't notice his cell phone going off because of crowd noise? He is a senior intelligence officer, sitting next to the President, for heaven's sake - don't you think he would be a little more attentive and professional, just by training? After the nuclear detonation, cell phones (or any phones, or anything?!) work, and a helicopter crash is survivable. No one beyond ground zero gets radiation poisoning? The Russians order Stealth aircraft shot down (big duh for that line)? I am willing to suspend disbelief in an action movie, but I can't leave my brain at the door.And finally, the romance element is completely underwritten. A series of Hallmark card romantic encounters set up solely so that the phone can ring and interrupt them. There was no individuality or chemistry to make Jack's sense of loss feel genuine. Even a young doctor has some ""doctor-ness"" about her, and the actress playing this part made me feel that she was doing just that - playing a part. Watch Ann Archer in the earlier films - she is so different at home and at work.So what kept me in my seat till the credits? Some amazing acting, all the more amazing because there was not much substance to actually portray. Morgan Freeman struggling to supress a smile when Jack's girlfriend hangs up on him after Jack excuses standing her up because he is on a plane to Russia. Liev Schreiber demonstrating the brawn and intelligence that befits an intelligence field operative, especially in the scene in the hospital in Moscow with the mother of one of the missing Soviet nuclear scientists. And Ciaran Hinds - whose expressive face seems full of wisdom and conflict all the way through this movie. He made what could have been a charicature of Russian leaders into a surprisingly sympathetic protagonist.I would not recommend that anyone personally affected by 9/11 see this movie. During the nuclear explosion, the audience became frozen and silent, and a couple of people got up and left quickly. This is just a movie but we all leave the theatre and walk into the reality of 9/11 and its aftermath.

And how on Earth can you kill of Morgan Freeman, the best damn actor in the movie!?!The plot is a bit ridiculous and way to familiar to have any edge or freshness to it. A bomb goes missing and someone, by luck of the draw, terrorists, get it back. And who should they want to blow up? The United States. Surprise surprise.The idea of this is far more unbelievable than say Armageddon or Deep Impact which makes the idea of blowing up Baltimore a bit nonsensical. Crash meteors into the Earth, sure, no one will question it because it won't happen for probably millions of years, supposedly, so the premiss can easily be dismissed. But blowing up Baltimore from a nuclear explosion, though the technicality of it, being an old and somewhat less effective bomb, I did find appealing. Someone did their homework.But it doesn't make sense either that Ben Affleck should be able to get a hold of Russian high command. I was all too reminded of Peter Selleres in ihs outstanding role in Dr. Strangelove pleading with a retarded soldier to let him call the White House. For some reason, a comedic performance was much more believable, both dealing with the same situation. Perhaps it's because Ben Affleck can't act his way out of a wet paper bag.

Some time in the very near future, CIA analyst and historian Jack Ryan (Ben Affleck) finds himself caught up in a plot by European Neo-Nazis to set the U.S. and post-Communist Russia against each other so that they can, presumably, sweep up whatever pieces are left (which strikes me as not the smartest plan going).  As inThe Hunt for Red October, Ryan finds that many people in positions of power aren't prepared to listen to what he has to say, and only by a bold stroke is he able to carry out his self-appointed mission of stopping the missiles from flying.Of course, like all Tom Clancy movies, the story is far too complicated to summarize in the space I'm given here.  And I have to give it points for all-too-probable scariness: in a world where building a small, dirty atomic bomb is almost within the reach of a high-school physics student, to say nothing of disaffected political groups with agendas of their own, what happens on celluloid could well happen for real some day.  What bothers me most about it is that, apart from its similarities to ""Red October,"" it seems to be out of chronological order.  The original book was published in 1991, seven years after ""RO.""  Affleck's Ryan is not only clearly much younger than Harrison Ford's (and even considerably younger than Alec Baldwin's), he isn't even married yet (he's dating a second-year medical resident who doesn't have a clue about what he really does for a living)--now surely it wouldn't have been difficult to establish him as a family man, and it might even have added to the suspense.

I thought it was excellent because I felt 'something' as I was walking out of the theatre.  I don't know-  I liked particularly the latter part of the movie, where Ben Affleck tries to convince both side to the very ending of the movie.  I am not personally familiar with Tom Clancy's novels (I began to read his novels, after watching this movie twice, starting with 'the Hunt for Red October'), meaning I'm giving this review purely from 'unadulterated' perspective.It looks like lot of reviewers gave this movie low rating due to 'political incorrectness' and 'revisions' from original plot.  However, I still thought it was an excellent movie for several reasons.  Honestly I could not pinpoint exactly why I felt 'moved' when I was walking out of theatre nor inspired watching it on DVD again- I think, I think I felt moved and inspired because it does demonstrate a glimpse of 'truth', the truth that all nuclear war is possible as long as we and they have them.  Our very fear of nuclear war might have diminished considerably after the end of the Cold War era, however, the 'possibility' still exists as long as the existence of nuclear weapons is a fact.  I do not think the 'possibility' of nuclear war would differ whether it's Neo-Nazis or some fundamental terrorists trying to accomplish their purpose; the 'more' important point is that the sum of all fears will exists no matter what.  I think I was moved because of another possibility that this existence of sum of all fears can be prevented by one side's willingness to yield and back down 'unconditionally'.  This was very important factor, at least for a novice movie critic like myself, because you are preventing the sum of all fears by 'putting down' your pride and even risking everything you have-  I was definitely inspired by Russian president's very courageous and bold decision in the heat of the moment... wow.You know, perhaps I was moved walking out of the theatre on one sunny day because of realization that anything is possible.  Anything is possible in the sense that I might die or vaporize instantly without knowing it, especially when you went through and witness 9/11.  I was motivated to live my life more faithfully and courageously.  And I also want to believe that the good of humanity can be achieved through true courage.  (I'm being sidetrack here...but who's real 'chicken' when you refuse to smoke back in high school under peer-pressure?

This is the Jack Ryan that Tom Clancy intended!It's not easy replacing Harrison Ford but Ben Affleck does a great job! Affleck combines intelligence with quirkiness, making this film also very funny at times. Clancy would approve!Clancy himself said Ben Affleck is his favorite actor as yet to have played the Jack Ryan character. Jack Ryan was never suppossed to be as old as Ford and was always suppossed to be more beleivable than Baldwin. Heck, Baldwin's why ""Hunt for Red October"" is the worst of the Clancy adaptations.Ryan's a confident overachiever and I beleive that this is the first time he has relly been portrayed that way.  Affleck plays the role brilliantly.Also great is Bridget Moynohan in the role of Affleck's girlfriend(look for her next in another CIA thriller, THE RECRUIT with Colin Farrell and Al PAcino). Affleck has all the luck! She's hot!Completely boring.Don't listen to reviewers who say this hits too close to home! If anything it gave me some closure on the whole 9/11 thing.

596688,A72S4SWJWIBCV,B00005JL8F,Cutre,"[5, 6]","Ok, ok, so first of all, I thought Ben Affleck wouldn't be a good Jack Ryan after Harrison Ford and Alec Baldwin. I couldn't quite get the fact the characters are all younger than in the previous films and yet, the storyline deals with current history events. They didn't only replace Harrison Ford, but they also replaced Willem Dafoe and Anne Archer for Liev Schrieber and Bridget Moynahan and as a big fan of the previous films, I can't help wondering how would this film would have looked with those older actors in it.But what's done its done and I decided to enjoy this film. I went to see it and I was surprisingly pleased. I think everyone did a great job and as far as the story goes, I think it's good. The story is about a nuclear weapon that was lost in 70s and now it's in the hands of some european terrorists who come up with an elaborate plan to use that bomb in a major US city... But CIA analyst Jack Ryan (in this movie, you could almost see him as a trainee instead) realizes something's wrong. And as a young CIA guy, the older people won't listen to him, so of course, he has to prove it all by himself, with a little help of John Clark (Schrieber), some kind of undercover CIA merc.What comes next is one of the finest thrillers in the last few years and I am quite surprised they didn't delayed the release of this movie after September 11th, considering it depicts the worst terrorist act ever imaginable on US soil. Maybe it was because of 9/11 was a rather recent event when I saw this movie, but I was quite touched by this movie and the whole situation it shows. And also it is rather scary to see how easy one of these horrible things can be planned and carried out. But that's the reason this movie works so well, because you can feel it. And if you get a main character as likable as Jack Ryan, the experience is a whole lot better.Ben Affleck is quite good as Ryan, in his own way. He doesn't play a very different Ryan from Harrison Ford's version. You can even see the pillow thing on his hair. And Morgan Freeman is also really good, but what else could you expect from that guy? I mean, he's a wonderful actor.All in all, it does have some mistakes, or at least, I didn't understand a few things... but I guess it is a movie, it's just entertainment, and after seeing some of the things this movie shows, I think the last thing anyone would want is this movie being close to reality.",4,"What's with the hair, Jack?",1034726400,"10 16, 2002",2002,2420,"['Ok', 'ok', 'first', 'thought', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'good', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'could', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'fact', 'characters', 'are', 'all', 'younger', 'previous', 'films', 'yet', 'storyline', 'deals', 'current', 'history', 'events', 'did', ""n't"", 'only', 'replace', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'also', 'replaced', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Anne', 'Archer', 'Liev', 'Schrieber', 'Bridget', 'Moynahan', 'big', 'fan', 'previous', 'films', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wondering', 'how', 'would', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'looked', 'older', 'actors', 'it.But', 'what', 'done', 'done', 'decided', 'enjoy', 'film', 'went', 'see', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'pleased', 'think', 'everyone', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'as', 'far', 'story', 'think', 'good', 'story', 'nuclear', 'weapon', 'was', 'lost', '70s', 'now', 'hands', 'european', 'terrorists', 'who', 'come', 'up', 'elaborate', 'plan', 'use', 'bomb', 'major', 'US', 'city', 'CIA', 'analyst', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'movie', 'could', 'almost', 'see', 'trainee', 'instead', 'something', 'wrong', 'young', 'CIA', 'guy', 'older', 'people', 'wo', ""n't"", 'listen', 'so', 'course', 'prove', 'little', 'help', 'John', 'Clark', 'Schrieber', 'kind', 'undercover', 'CIA', 'merc.What', 'next', 'one', 'finest', 'thrillers', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'am', 'quite', 'surprised', 'did', ""n't"", 'delayed', 'release', 'movie', 'September', '11th', 'considering', 'worst', 'terrorist', 'act', 'ever', 'imaginable', 'US', 'soil', 'Maybe', 'was', '9/11', 'was', 'rather', 'recent', 'event', 'when', 'saw', 'movie', 'was', 'quite', 'touched', 'movie', 'whole', 'situation', 'also', 'rather', 'scary', 'see', 'how', 'easy', 'one', 'horrible', 'things', 'can', 'be', 'planned', 'carried', 'out', 'reason', 'movie', 'so', 'well', 'can', 'feel', 'get', 'main', 'character', 'as', 'likable', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'experience', 'whole', 'lot', 'better.Ben', 'Affleck', 'quite', 'good', 'Ryan', 'own', 'way', ""n't"", 'play', 'very', 'different', 'Ryan', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'version', 'can', 'even', 'see', 'pillow', 'thing', 'hair', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'also', 'really', 'good', 'what', 'else', 'could', 'expect', 'guy', 'mean', 'wonderful', 'actor.All', 'have', 'mistakes', 'least', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'few', 'things', 'guess', 'movie', 'just', 'entertainment', 'seeing', 'things', 'movie', 'think', 'last', 'thing', 'anyone', 'would', 'want', 'movie', 'being', 'close', 'reality']",N/A

596691,A2HJZ2KN9YA9L2,B00005JL8F,"Daniel B. Waldman ""Film Guru""","[3, 6]","When I was in college I heard Tom Clancy give a lecture.  He was one of three bestselling authors whose lectures I attended in those days.  The others were Kurt Vonnegut and Ray Bradbury.  Tom Clancy was easily the least impressive.  While Vonnegut & Bradbury talked about the art of writing, story construction, heroic quests and narrative structure, Clancy's primary message was limited to ""vote Republican.""  He was bored with the topic of storytelling, brushing it off with the comment that his inspiration came from the front page section of The Washington Post, and not much more than that.His lack of interest probably explains why his Jack Ryan may be the blandest recurring protagonist in literature.  He completely lacks the personality that is obviously present in Sherlock Holmes, Tarzan, Horace Rumpole or James Bond. As such he is the easiest to transform from film to film.  In previous incarnations he was portrayed by Alec Baldwin in the stylish Hunt for Red October and by Harrison Ford in the grittier Patriot Games & Clear & Present Danger.  Supporting characters remained a constant as with the Bond pictures and the Ryan character was something of an everyman who gets sucked into adventures, but an everyman with little to no distinguishing characteristics.  (Had these films been made in the '40s & 50's Cary Grant would be an ideal choice.  Don't believe me?  Watch North by Northwest.)  A major star is needed to bring the character to life.  Any major star would do.  A black woman could play the part and it would still work.  (Actually that would be pretty cool -- Pam Grier as Jackie Ryan in The Cardinal and the Kremlin!)In this movie we get Ben Affleck, who as an actor has proved himself in Chasing Amy, even if he has played the pretty boy leads in two Maichael Bay movies.  He is a much younger actor than Harrison Ford and they make his youth work in terms of the plot to actually add suspense as an analyst who is always dead on but no one believes him because of his youth (a regular Pandora).  (I'd still like to see Pam Grier try the role.) He is aided by a talented supporting cast, including Liev Schriber, breaking out of the art house into mainstream Hollywood by playing John Clark, another recurring character previously played in the films by Willem Dafoe.Each movie must be taken on its own merits from the story it manages to pull from the unwieldy tomes Tom Clancy cranks out and continuity be damned.  This one fares pretty well, all things considered.  It feels pretty much like a standard issue action thriller, but then so did the previous installments.  And as usual the filmmakers had a better understanding of the visual arts than Clancy has of writing clear and concise sentences.  Some sequences are extremely well put together, especially the nuclear blast which is never actually shown, just the immediate aftermath.  Solid performances all around help to sustain this action centerpiece.  Much of it is a by the numbers action film, but then so are James Bond movies.  Of course Bond movies also usually have a sharper sense of humor and a more noteworthy protagonist.

596692,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00005JL8F,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 3]","Maybe I'm too easy to please, but I found The Sum of All Fears to be one powerful humdinger of a motion picture.  I should point out that I came into this film with no preconceptions; I have not read any of Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan novels, nor have I seen any of the earlier movies starring Harrison Ford in the central role.  I can certainly see how major and strange a transition it must be for fans to go from the older Ford to the young Affleck, and the obvious disparity between the film and the book that inspired it would also probably bother me had I previously read Clancy's 1991 novel.  I was attracted to this movie for two reasons: one is the plot.  Delaying the release of this film in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attack was the right thing to do, given the subject matter dealt with here, but it also served to pique my interests in the film.  As an old and unrepentant Cold Warrior now viewing the world through eyes permanently rimmed red by the reprehensible actions of cowardly terrorists, the idea of an American-Russian nuclear war brought about by the maneuvering of terrorists definitely spoke to me.  The other aspect of the film that appealed to me was the prominent role played by Morgan Freeman.  I've said it before, and I'm sure I'll say it again: in my opinion, Morgan Freeman is the greatest actor working today.The complex yet tightly-wound plot of this film is impressive.  The sudden death of a Soviet (now Russian) leader still carries with it a significant amount of trepidation in the West, but this film takes such fears to an unprecedented level.  The characterization of Russian President Nemerov is, I think, the most crucial element of this entire plot, and it comes off magnificently.  Talk about being boxed in against a wall.  Try being a new Russian leader already regarded as a hard-liner by basically everyone in the West (except for CIA analyst Jack Ryan) and then have forces that should be under your control but are not attack Grozny, Chechnya, with horrible chemical weapons.  No Russian President can admit less than total control of his military.  Then have a nuclear bomb go off in a major American city, a tragedy made to look rather convincingly as an act of Russian aggression.  Americans are going to respond to such an attack with extreme prejudice.  Thus, before you have your new Presidential chair adequately adjusted for your comfort, you're on the brink of nuclear war.  Ciaran Hinds deserves all the credit I can give him for his convincing performance as President Nemerov; he (not Affleck, and not even Freeman) makes this motion picture the overwhelming success I think it is.The entire cast of this film is excellent (even Affleck), and so is the production value of everything you see.  The special effects are impressive (and it was a treat to see just how they were brought to life in the DVD special features dealing with the visual effects), but these are just the trimmings on the real feast.  The meat of The Sum of All Fears is a plot which is compelling, believable, disquieting, and, in the end, rather moving.  This movie drew me in completely to its world of intelligence, espionage, deception, politics, and diplomacy, and I could not possibly give it less than five stars.",5,"An awe-inspiring, well-conceived thriller",1078704000,"03 8, 2004",2004,3257,"['Maybe', ""'m"", 'too', 'easy', 'please', 'found', 'Sum', 'All', 'Fears', 'be', 'one', 'powerful', 'humdinger', 'motion', 'picture', 'should', 'point', 'out', 'came', 'film', 'preconceptions', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'Tom', 'Clancy', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'novels', 'have', 'seen', 'earlier', 'movies', 'starring', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'central', 'role', 'can', 'certainly', 'see', 'how', 'major', 'strange', 'transition', 'must', 'be', 'fans', 'go', 'older', 'Ford', 'young', 'Affleck', 'obvious', 'disparity', 'film', 'book', 'inspired', 'would', 'also', 'probably', 'had', 'previously', 'read', 'Clancy', '1991', 'novel', 'was', 'attracted', 'movie', 'two', 'reasons', 'one', 'plot', 'Delaying', 'release', 'film', 'wake', '9/11', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'was', 'right', 'thing', 'do', 'given', 'subject', 'matter', 'dealt', 'here', 'also', 'served', 'pique', 'interests', 'film', 'old', 'unrepentant', 'Cold', 'Warrior', 'now', 'viewing', 'world', 'eyes', 'permanently', 'rimmed', 'red', 'reprehensible', 'actions', 'cowardly', 'terrorists', 'idea', 'American-Russian', 'nuclear', 'war', 'brought', 'about', 'maneuvering', 'terrorists', 'definitely', 'spoke', 'other', 'aspect', 'film', 'appealed', 'was', 'prominent', 'role', 'played', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', ""'ve"", 'said', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'say', 'again', 'opinion', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'greatest', 'actor', 'working', 'today.The', 'complex', 'yet', 'tightly-wound', 'plot', 'film', 'impressive', 'sudden', 'death', 'Soviet', 'now', 'Russian', 'leader', 'still', 'significant', 'amount', 'trepidation', 'West', 'film', 'such', 'fears', 'unprecedented', 'level', 'characterization', 'Russian', 'President', 'Nemerov', 'think', 'most', 'crucial', 'element', 'entire', 'plot', 'off', 'magnificently', 'Talk', 'being', 'boxed', 'wall', 'Try', 'being', 'new', 'Russian', 'leader', 'already', 'regarded', 'hard-liner', 'basically', 'everyone', 'West', 'CIA', 'analyst', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'then', 'have', 'forces', 'should', 'be', 'control', 'are', 'not', 'attack', 'Grozny', 'Chechnya', 'horrible', 'chemical', 'weapons', 'Russian', 'President', 'can', 'admit', 'less', 'total', 'control', 'military', 'Then', 'have', 'nuclear', 'bomb', 'go', 'off', 'major', 'American', 'city', 'tragedy', 'made', 'look', 'rather', 'convincingly', 'act', 'Russian', 'aggression', 'Americans', 'are', 'going', 'respond', 'attack', 'extreme', 'prejudice', 'Thus', 'have', 'new', 'Presidential', 'chair', 'adequately', 'adjusted', 'comfort', ""'re"", 'brink', 'nuclear', 'war', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'credit', 'can', 'give', 'convincing', 'performance', 'President', 'Nemerov', 'not', 'Affleck', 'not', 'even', 'Freeman', 'motion', 'picture', 'overwhelming', 'success', 'think', 'is.The', 'entire', 'cast', 'film', 'excellent', 'even', 'Affleck', 'so', 'production', 'value', 'everything', 'see', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'impressive', 'was', 'treat', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'were', 'brought', 'life', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'dealing', 'visual', 'effects', 'are', 'just', 'trimmings', 'real', 'feast', 'meat', 'Sum', 'All', 'Fears', 'plot', 'compelling', 'believable', 'disquieting', 'end', 'rather', 'moving', 'movie', 'drew', 'completely', 'world', 'intelligence', 'espionage', 'deception', 'politics', 'diplomacy', 'could', 'not', 'possibly', 'give', 'less', 'five', 'stars']",N/A

The book see's an older Ryan, accomplished within the CIA.  He is married and is approaching retirement.  The movie is the opposite, Ryan is just starting out, just dating his future wife and starting out as a simple report writer for the CIA.The relation between the plot of the book and the plot of the movie is almost totally different.

This is probably a good thing for I'm convinced that it's usually a mistake to bring along this baggage when viewing the movie version.  I also deliberately blocked out the previous Jack Ryan incarnations portrayed by Alex Baldwin and Harrison Ford.  Each movie should be judged on its own merits. ""The Sum of all Fears"" is an effective, but not fantastic action film.  Ben Affleck does an admirable job depicting Ryan as a Generation X Central Intelligence Agency analyst.  Ryan writes a report on a Russian politician who becomes that nation's leader.  One thing leads to another and his CIA boss Bill Cabot (the always brilliant Morgan Freeman) thrusts him into the spot light.  Ryan is now an advisor to the President's cabinet and assists Cabot in monitoring Russia's nuclear capability.  Unknown to them, white supremacist terrorists are plotting to trick both the Russians and the United States into a total war against each other.  They have no hesitation to explode a nuclear weapon resulting in widespread death and destruction. Ryan and his cohorts battle the terrorists---and do not always win.  Did the makers hold back on the ghoulish horror of a major bomb explosion due to the events of 9/11?  If so, this was a major error.  We need to be continuously warned about the real life terrorists who are committed to putting all of us to death. Movies should be far more realistic in this respect than they ever were in the past.Alan Bates is the wrong choice to play the Austrian Nazi Fuehrer.  Perhaps I am unable to forget that Bates is a British Isle citizen in real life.  Nevertheless, the casting didn't ring true.  Liev Schreiber, though, is near perfect as the CIA operations officer who does the dirty work his superiors will disavow at a moment's notice. James Cromwell looks presidential and serves well as President Fowler.  One of my favorite actors is Colm Feore.  He is excellent as the diabolically amoral South African arms dealer.  Feore deserved an academy award nomination a few years ago for his portrayal of the eccentric pianist Glenn Gould.  It is deeply regretful that his part was not expanded in ""The Sum of all Fears.""The movie was weakened considerably by director Phil Alden Robinson's decision to ignore the threat of Muslim terrorists.  Tom Clancy included this danger in the book, but Robinson well meaningly (and I'm sure his heart was in the right place) publicly declared ""that I have no intention of promoting negative images of Muslims or Arabs.""

Strange?  Only when judging the film with the novel and the author's entire body of work involving Jack Ryan.  Having not read the novel, this obvious discrepancy did not play a part in my judgement of the film or its performances.On the whole, the film is good; the premise believable, all the more chilling in the wake of 9-11.  Affleck is on the brink of being 'discovered' by the CIA higher-ups; his paper on the new Russian president moves him into an inner circle of quick decision-making presidential advisers headed by the wonderful Morgan Freeman.  Not knowing the protocol, Ryan speaks when he is not spoken to, is judged green, shut down by the brass and goes through many agonizing moments of frustration when he is not even given the chance to express his theories.In the end, he is proven correct, but not before monumentally catastrophic disaster strikes in scenes all too reminiscient of 9-11.Affleck is amicable enough as Ryan; I would have liked to see how Harrison Ford's more mature Ryan would have changed the plot and the interchange with other characters.

James Cromwell does well by the President although not always well served by the scriptwriter. There are thrills aplenty as we watch, knowing that an unexploded nuclear bomb has been discovered in the Golan Heights. Who has it? What will they do with it? Finding out provides its share of thrills as the film unfolds. By far, not of the first rank, but sufficient for an entertaining two hours.After my brief comment I read some of the negative reviews. Taste for films varies by individuals, as it  does for most cultural objects. I did not read the book, or if I did, it was too long ago for me to  remember the plot, so I would not comment on the relationship of the screenplay to the novel. However, I am moved, as I often am, vigorously to disagree with the notion that one can translate a book into a movie as if each word projects an exact image on screen. Words on a page are words on a page, images on a screen are images on a screen,  and never the twain will meet. Of course, some poorer novels are written essentially as screenplays so the film-maker has little trouble using them almost as is. Some movies take a highly literate book  and fail because they do not make something new out it. I am entirely on the side of Fred Astaire, who insisted to a person who was being ""portrayed"" in one of his films, that regardless of what she and her husband had actually done, the film demanded something other than that to be successful. As one of our ages' best artists said of painting, if what is in a painting could be said in words, you have a lousy painting. Painting is for what cannot be communicated any other way.

However, I do enjoy reading about politics, chiefly in the news and learning about different sides to events through documentaries and films.From the outset, I loved the film in an overall sense: the wonderment of seeing what goes on behind ""closed curtains,"" our hero Jack Ryan trying to unfoil a devious plot concocted ""by the Russians,"" and the mysterious aura of being associated with the CIA really had me on the edge of my seat.Aside from that however, there are a few things the filmmakers employ in the movie that will make you say, ""What?"" The first of these ""problems"" is that good ole Hollywood campiness. Not to give the movie away for those that haven't seen it, the part where our hero Ryan reunites with his doctor girlfriend after the ""colossal event,"" she gives a pretty lame remark, especially having gone through such a monstrous occurrence, not to mention that she is basically unharmed which is ridiculous when you view her proximity to the ""mechanism"" that goes off basically in front of her face. Another campy part is where Ryan's helicopter goes down, wrecks badly, the pilot dies...and the radio still works. Yes - Ryan uses the radio to make contact for help. I guess I can let this slide by though, especially considering Hollywood usually acts in the protagonist's favor.Other parts of the movie will have you raising your eyebrow in utter confusion - an excellent example of this? When the culprits are ""caught"" at the end. We basically have a middleman pitting America against Russia with both powers on the verge of nuking each other to oblivion, and eventually the villain and his cronies are caught. Sounds good, yes, and can you expect a whopping ending to such heinous atrocities committed by the baddies? Think again. I was amazed to the point of horrification when I saw how badly the villains were ""caught.""Other than these shortcomings, the film is enjoyable, although it could've been better in my opinion. The script was exceptionally conceived, and while the actors do a good job, I think we've seen Morgan Freeman in better portrayals (but of course, the actor's job is to act, not treat a script even if it is subpar). The pace of the movie stutters a bit here and there, but overall, like I said this is a very good film, especially if you like political thrillers. The reason I give it three stars is because...well...it's slightly above average but...it could've been a little better.",3,"Intriguing Story, Questionable Execution",1144108800,"04 4, 2006",2006,2810,"['must', 'admit', 'first', 'Phil', 'Robinson', 'director', 'film', 'least', 'being', 'aware', ""'m"", 'not', 'political', 'fiction', 'head', 'have', 'empty', 'section', 'Tom', 'Clancy', 'novels', 'library', 'home', 'am', 'aware', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'protagonist', 'being', 'played', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Clancy', 'film', 'adaptations', 'Patriot', 'Games', 'Clear', 'Present', 'Danger', 'However', 'do', 'enjoy', 'reading', 'politics', 'chiefly', 'news', 'learning', 'different', 'sides', 'events', 'documentaries', 'films.From', 'outset', 'loved', 'film', 'overall', 'sense', 'wonderment', 'seeing', 'what', 'closed', 'curtains', 'hero', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'trying', 'unfoil', 'devious', 'plot', 'concocted', 'Russians', 'mysterious', 'aura', 'being', 'associated', 'CIA', 'really', 'had', 'edge', 'seat.Aside', 'however', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'filmmakers', 'employ', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'say', 'What', 'first', 'problems', 'good', 'ole', 'Hollywood', 'campiness', 'Not', 'give', 'movie', 'away', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'part', 'where', 'hero', 'Ryan', 'doctor', 'girlfriend', 'colossal', 'event', 'pretty', 'lame', 'remark', 'especially', 'having', 'gone', 'monstrous', 'occurrence', 'not', 'mention', 'basically', 'unharmed', 'ridiculous', 'when', 'view', 'proximity', 'mechanism', 'off', 'basically', 'front', 'face', 'campy', 'part', 'where', 'Ryan', 'helicopter', 'down', 'wrecks', 'badly', 'pilot', 'dies', 'radio', 'still', 'Yes', 'Ryan', 'radio', 'make', 'contact', 'help', 'guess', 'can', 'let', 'slide', 'especially', 'considering', 'Hollywood', 'usually', 'protagonist', 'favor.Other', 'parts', 'movie', 'will', 'have', 'raising', 'eyebrow', 'utter', 'confusion', 'excellent', 'example', 'When', 'culprits', 'are', 'caught', 'end', 'basically', 'have', 'middleman', 'pitting', 'America', 'Russia', 'powers', 'verge', 'nuking', 'other', 'oblivion', 'eventually', 'villain', 'cronies', 'are', 'caught', 'Sounds', 'good', 'yes', 'can', 'expect', 'whopping', 'ending', 'such', 'heinous', 'atrocities', 'committed', 'baddies', 'Think', 'again', 'was', 'amazed', 'point', 'horrification', 'when', 'saw', 'how', 'badly', 'villains', 'were', 'caught', 'Other', 'shortcomings', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'opinion', 'script', 'was', 'exceptionally', 'conceived', 'actors', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'think', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'better', 'portrayals', 'course', 'actor', 'job', 'act', 'not', 'treat', 'script', 'even', 'subpar', 'pace', 'movie', 'bit', 'here', 'there', 'overall', 'said', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'especially', 'like', 'political', 'thrillers', 'reason', 'give', 'three', 'stars', 'well', 'slightly', 'above', 'average', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'little', 'better']",N/A

The film version predictably discards all of that in favor of a politically correct one dimensional right wing neo nazi plot.To add insult to injury they transplant Ben Affleck into the role of a post adolescent Jack Ryan.

Tom Clancy must have more money than some foreign countries.  Doesn't he have enough clout to dictate a true filming of his work?  Or enough money to say ""Do it my way or not at all?"".And to some degree I still agree with this thought.  The decision to diminish the Arab role as part of the bad-guy contingent is absolutely unforgivable.  What are they afraid of, that people might actually think that there are forces in the Middle East that would like to plant terror in the United States?  Who could think of such a thing?  No, let's put all the blame on the shoulders of those universal bad guys, the neo-Nazis.And going back in time in the Jack Ryan series was not a problem to me.  But to have him just meeting his future wife is an irritation.  If gives her the thankless role of playing the suffering girlfriend who sighs as her man saves the world.  Finally, does anybody else notice that the proximity all our heroes are to the nuclear device means that slow death by cancer is just around the corner?All of the above in unforgivable, and yet, the novel was about more than these things.  It was about the sheer ruthlessness of what some people will do to achieve their ends.  This is well portrayed here, though I would have rather seen the religious fanaticism that fuels today's attacks used here.  It's about the toughness of making decisions when your country has just been attacked and you have to decide how many people you're going to kill in return.  And it's about the realization that even though The Cold War is over, the need for a strong military is probably necessary.Oh yes, Ben as Jack.  The movie does go overboard to show his uncomfortable ness in his new role with the CIA.  They didn't have to hit you over the head with this.  And he seems to know a lot of things that the rest of the world doesn't.  But when it gets down and dirty, he does handle the job credibly, and I wasn't prepared to say this.

The movie basically follows around a missing Israeli nuclear bomb, and the bomb is brought by a neo-nazi who plans to use it against the Americans. Now Jack Ryan (played by Ben Affleck) is a young CIA analyst who is still learning the ropes in the spy world, he has a girlfriend; Cathy Muller; a doctor for John Hopkins in Baltimore. As Jack learns his way around the CIA, he gets the information that a bomb is planning to come to America, for what Jack does not know until it is too late. The bomb is used at the Super Bowl, and a fake colonel in the Russian Navy orders Russian MiG's to fire on a American ship, and now the President thinks that the Russian's set the bomb off, and the President wants to wipe out Russia for so-calling killing thousand of lives in that game. So now Jack Ryan comes into the picture, and tells the President that the Russians didnt do it; it was a neo-nazi who set off the bomb. So Jack saves the day, and the neo-nazi is taken care of thanks to a car bomb, and the end.So why did I give it 2 stars? In the novel, the enemy was not a neo-nazi, it was Palentinan terrorist who get a hold of a bomb that was used during the six-day war which it failed to explode.

596729,A1L0HZI35HF8OF,B00005JL8F,Eric V. Moye,"[2, 3]","This is the latest in the series of Jack Ryan movies, although it is based on one of Tom Clancy's most ponderous novel, written in 1991.  This book is also the only Clancy novel I just could never finish, despite trying to commence it on at least four occasions (including an airplane, which for me is the ultimate test).  Since Clancy has taken Jack Ryan as far as he can go without making him either God or  the ruler of the entire world, the money-makers have had to take us back in time to another vehicle.The plot is pretty standard.  In Europe, a neo-Nazi acquires the bomb (one which was somehow lost by us and our allies in the Middle East).  The plan is to detonate it in the U.S. in an effort to start a war between Russia and the U.S. They intend to do so at the Super Bowl in Baltimore, which the President is attending.The special effects are great when the bomb goes off, in a sequence which is breathtaking and a sobering reminder of what may well lie in store for us one day.  As another has noted, the center of  the movie is the aftermath of the explosion.

I was most enthusiastic with Baldwin, and saw Ryan as a younger man, less of the ""everyman"" whom Harrison Ford seems to have played in every role since Hans Solo.

596730,A2SRZQU1SZG4RR,B00005JL8F,"Erika Borsos ""pepper flower""","[3, 8]","The film begins with gripping scenes and haunting music ... Fighter jets landing, powerful spiritual music that is sad and almost like a funeral - setting the tone for what is to come. Ben Affleck plays the CIA agent Jack Ryan to perfection. There is great casting for all the major roles and key characters in the book. Although in the book, the city of Denver is the location used by terrorists for the attack, the choice of Baltimore, Maryland makes sense, since there is a port which clearly can be the point of entry for contraband. The fact is the film remains true to the intentions and spirit of Tom Clancy's book. There is political maneuvering, espionage, edge-of-your seat gripping moments after the attack and a very well executed plot. Suspense builds and the story unfolds ... The topic is fascinating and timely. It is almost like the ""007"" films of old ... You more or less know what to expect, but the ride is so engaging, you are caught up in the drama and events.A nuclear bomb is discovered in the desert by a bedouin, left buried from a downed airplane during the '73 Israeli War. He suspects it has some value and can make money by selling it. An agent purchases it for a mere pittance, vastly less than its true worth ... so realistic. After the unexpected death of the Russian President, his replacement is investigated by the CIA. The US President, his advisors and the CIA are busy extracting information about this relative ""dark horse"" to discover his stand on the major issues. In the past, Jack Ryan had written a paper on him, extrapolating his views on world events ... He accompanies a delegation from the US to visit Russia and ensure nuclear disarmament is going according to plans. Each side assesses the opposition with wary reminders of the past ever in the forefront of their minds ... How difficult it was to learn about Soviet arms during the cold war, US agents had died trying to access .information ... now a delegation was freely being shown the labs, nuclear reactor and storage facilties. Times had indeed changed ...The US President attends a filled to capacity football stadium in Baltimore, MD when suddenly, unexpectedly and rapidly Secret Agents usher him out ... A huge explosion occurs, with the mushroom  cloud indicating  a nuclear bomb went off. During the disaster, Jack Ryan seeks his superior, only to find him taking his last breath. He pays his last respects and uses his cell phone and ID bage to enter the White House. Jack had discovered irrefutable evidence that proves it was *not* a Russian attack. The nuclear substance originated in the United States. The fingerprints of the explosion and subsequent fall out are positive proof. However, suspense builds as the US President and Russian President are on stand-by preparing for war ... trying to read each others motives for action. The unraveling of the peace accords takes minutes although it took years and years to create peace and disarmament. The difficult decisions faced by the US President are depicted superbly ... The raw emotions arising during such a national disaster are naturally conveyed. The only failure in the film is the choice of selecting a disgruntled fascist group as the culprits for the attack. Keeping it closer to the story line in the book would have paid off huge dividends in the short and long run. In the years following 2001 and the Sept. 11th attack, using ancient history such as Nazi-like fascists as the enemy just does not play well with an audience. It leaves a huge credibility gap ...this is why it reminds me of the ""007"" films. Despite this one major flaw, for which I deducted one star, the film was a hit with this viewer. I highly recommend it.Erika Borsos [pepper flower]",4,Thoroughly Engaging!

596732,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,B00005JL8F,Erik North,"[0, 2]","The fourth film based on Tom Clancy's CIA analyst character Jack Ryan, but the first since the excellent 1994 film CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER, THE SUM OF ALL FEARS sees Ben Affleck get the extremely unenviable job of playing the character that Alec Baldwin essayed marvelously in THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER, and the inestimable Harrison Ford polished to a tee in PATRIOT GAMES and CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER.  And while he's not totally successful at doing it, he does a better job than most other actors of his generation might have done.This time around, the situation revolves around a nuclear weapon being stolen by a group of neo-Nazi fascists, led by a Hitler-type fanatic named Dressler (Alan Bates), whose intent is to start a nuclear exchange between the US and Russia that will result in a Fourth Reich rising from the ashes.  Under the mentorship of CIA head Cabot (the always reliable Morgan Freeman), Affleck rushes to try to convince both the American president (James Cromwell) and the Russians of the actual reality of this threat before a fatal misunderstanding starts World War III.  It becomes even more imperative when that nuclear device is detonated in Baltimore, obliterating that city in a mushroom cloud.THE SUM OF ALL FEARS is fairly well directed by Phil Alden Robinson, whose 1992 techno-thriller SNEAKERS is an extremely underrated piece.  Affleck does what he can in trying to make himself believable as Jack Ryan; and as mentioned before, he does more than enough to avoid unfair comparisons between him, Ford, and Baldwin.  Cromwell makes for a very good President; and Bates is absolutely chilling as Dressler.  In fact, his performance really is the best in the movie because his low-key acting makes his character not only seem plausible but probable.I can't speak to the changing of the villains from Islamic extremists in the book to neo-Nazis in the film; but the film would almost certainly have gotten the same rating anyway--it is slightly flawed, but never boring despite its lengthy running time.  Given how soon it came out in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks of 2001, its scenario is quite realistic long about now.  Jerry Goldsmith's score adds to the film's intense drama.To ""sum"" it all up, THE SUM OF ALL FEARS is a somewhat imperfect film, but, as with its three predecessors, far better than almost any other action film there is out there.",4,Stepping Into The Shoes Of Jack Ryan,1039046400,"12 5, 2002",2002,2391,"['fourth', 'film', 'based', 'Tom', 'Clancy', 'CIA', 'analyst', 'character', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'first', 'excellent', '1994', 'film', 'CLEAR', 'AND', 'PRESENT', 'DANGER', 'THE', 'SUM', 'OF', 'ALL', 'FEARS', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'get', 'extremely', 'unenviable', 'job', 'playing', 'character', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'essayed', 'marvelously', 'THE', 'HUNT', 'FOR', 'RED', 'OCTOBER', 'inestimable', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'polished', 'tee', 'PATRIOT', 'GAMES', 'CLEAR', 'AND', 'PRESENT', 'DANGER', 'not', 'totally', 'successful', 'doing', 'better', 'job', 'most', 'other', 'actors', 'generation', 'might', 'have', 'done.This', 'time', 'situation', 'nuclear', 'weapon', 'being', 'stolen', 'group', 'neo-Nazi', 'fascists', 'led', 'Hitler-type', 'fanatic', 'named', 'Dressler', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'intent', 'start', 'nuclear', 'exchange', 'US', 'Russia', 'will', 'result', 'Fourth', 'Reich', 'rising', 'ashes', 'mentorship', 'CIA', 'head', 'Cabot', 'always', 'reliable', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Affleck', 'try', 'convince', 'American', 'president', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'Russians', 'actual', 'reality', 'threat', 'fatal', 'misunderstanding', 'World', 'War', 'III', 'even', 'more', 'imperative', 'when', 'nuclear', 'device', 'detonated', 'Baltimore', 'obliterating', 'city', 'mushroom', 'cloud.THE', 'SUM', 'ALL', 'FEARS', 'fairly', 'well', 'directed', 'Phil', 'Alden', 'Robinson', '1992', 'techno-thriller', 'SNEAKERS', 'extremely', 'underrated', 'piece', 'Affleck', 'what', 'can', 'trying', 'make', 'believable', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'mentioned', 'more', 'enough', 'avoid', 'unfair', 'comparisons', 'Ford', 'Baldwin', 'Cromwell', 'very', 'good', 'President', 'Bates', 'absolutely', 'chilling', 'Dressler', 'fact', 'performance', 'really', 'best', 'movie', 'low-key', 'acting', 'character', 'not', 'only', 'seem', 'plausible', 'probable.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'changing', 'villains', 'Islamic', 'extremists', 'book', 'neo-Nazis', 'film', 'film', 'would', 'almost', 'certainly', 'have', 'gotten', 'same', 'rating', 'anyway', 'slightly', 'flawed', 'never', 'boring', 'lengthy', 'running', 'time', 'Given', 'how', 'soon', 'came', 'out', 'wake', '9/11', 'terrorist', 'attacks', '2001', 'scenario', 'quite', 'realistic', 'long', 'about', 'now', 'Jerry', 'Goldsmith', 'score', 'film', 'intense', 'drama.To', 'sum', 'up', 'THE', 'SUM', 'OF', 'ALL', 'FEARS', 'somewhat', 'imperfect', 'film', 'three', 'predecessors', 'far', 'better', 'almost', 'other', 'action', 'film', 'there']",N/A

These films are primarily, hardware showcase films to show the opposition what toys and capabilities the US has in the case of a war, especially nuclear. Everyone worldwide now knows that ANY expenditure of a nuclear weapon will result in the extermination of the human race. The nuclear race was based upon the premise of M.A.D. (mutually assured destruction) scenario as a deterrent. Of course, this may not apply to particular new powers who have nuclear capability i.e. North Korea, Iran, India, Pakistan, etc. who may be considered suicidal as a country, based perhaps on religious convictions and ignorance! Nuclear arsenals were expanded primarily for corporate profit, the world-extermination capability surpassed a thousand times over by the 1980s. Most of us have lived with this threat our entire lives! This film is not as far-fetched as one might believe in that the idiots who control world governments really do control the buttons that will end all life, subject to human frailties and stupidity. Baby Boomers well remember the Cuban Missile Crisis in which a shoe-pounding moron faced off with a drugged-out playboy with a bad back and almost blew up the world! Let's look at some of these scenarios as seen by Hollywood: Sum of All Fears--nuclear war created by splinter terrorist groups; On the Beach--complete extermination of the human race; Virus (Japanese)and Damnation Alley-- complete extermination of the human race, save for a small band of survivors; Fail Safe--hardware glitch and tradeoffs of cities to avoid total annihilation; Dr. Strangelove--military psycho who craves war. There is an old saying--If you build something, someone will eventually want to use it. At the end of WWII the American government and the Allies already knew they had won the war (at the cost of a million casualties) and that conventional attack of the Japanese mainland would eventually exterminate the Japanese race, at a very large loss of personnel on both sides. The Bomb was finished and the Powers-That-Be knew there were only a few months left to utilize the new Bomb, before the war would be over. It was easy to rationalize its use, the Japanese being the most brutal and horrible race on the planet at the time. But in reality, no one knew what The Bomb would really do.

It is amazing that the scriptwriter, the director or both did not know how to culminate all these events into a climax equal to the impressive filmmaking up to that point. Throughout this film the villains seemed to hold great power and influence and were in absolute control of events that they were manipulating. In the final third of the film the rug gets pulled out from under them and the rest of us. Even Jerry Goldsmith's score seemed to be somewhat reflective on the dubiousness of this entire project.

Credit the particular genius of Tom Clancy and his memorable creation of the main character in these suspense/espionage thrillers for that, but at the same time much credit is due screenwriters Paul Attanasio and Daniel Pyne for the tense dialogue and DiRector Phil Alden Robinson for the pacing of this story. As far as the story is concerned, very briefly the essence can be summarized as follows: When the president of Russia suddenly dies, a man whose politics are virtually unknown succeeds him. The change in political leaders sparks paranoia among American CIA officials, so CIA director Bill Cabot recruits a young analyst to supply insight and advice on the situation. Then the unthinkable happens: a nuclear bomb explodes in a U.S. city, and America is quick to blame the Russians.Jack Ryan was a role that seemed to belong to Harrison Ford in the other Clancy films, but here that role is assumed very well indeed by Ben Affleck. He is capably assisted by Morgan Freeman, James Cromwell, Bruce McGill, Liev Schreiber and Philip Baker Hall along with a large cast of supporting actors.

I'm not really a fan of much of his dramatic work (""Changing Lanes"" is an exception). I have not seen the other Jack Ryan movies, but I still didn't really think Affleck would make a credible CIA agent. So I was pleasantly surprised by his performance. It certainly isn't Oscar material, but he is very credible, which was more than I was expecting. The supporting cast is also quite good, especially the always impressive Morgan Freeman as Affleck's mentor and Ciaran Hinds as the Russian president.  Speaking of the Russian president, I was impressed by the way the film portrayed him. Usually, foreign leaders in films are very one-dimensional. President Nemerov, however, is very well developed, with clear motivations for his actions. He is not the evil madman Hollywood commonly makes foreigners (especially Russians) out to be. In fact, he is arguably a better person than the film's American president. So I commend the writers for that.  However, despite the acting and the good characters I did not really enjoy this film. Why? Because it's supposed to be suspenseful, and it's not. I know that Jack Ryan is trying to avert a major world crisis, but having him run around with a cell phone and type on computers does not generate much suspense. This is what a lot of the film, including the ""climax"" basically comes down to. The film is not deep enough to be a serious drama, so it needs the suspense and the action to deliver. Unfortunately, this does not happen. Although ""The Sum of All Fears"" does have some good qualities, it ultimately fails to deliver the basic needs of the genre, so I can't really recommend it.

This is the second Hollywood ""spy"" movie involving Russia, which I liked. The first one was excellent 1989 movie ""The Russia House"". This one is an adaptation of 1991 Tom Clancy book. I didn't read the book, but I suspect the screenwriters had to adjust its text quite a bit, since a lot of things had changed since 1991. The director and all the actors did a good job. I thought the music score by Jerry Goldsmith was excellent.  Morgan Freeman was as great as usual. I thought that the actor who played Russian President Nemirov did a pretty decent job, although he spoke Russian with immense accent (Why the Hollywood rarely gives Russians to play Russians?  May be they are afraid the Russians wouldn't look authentic?). President Nemirov (although his last name suggest ""no peace"") is shown as a complex and emotional character, generally pro-US, but sounding tough in order to keep his own hard-liners at bay. Of course, it is not difficult to recognize what this movie is  - a slightly belated tribute to the intelligence community who kept our politicians from nuking each other during not so glorious years of the ""Cold War"".Ryzhkov and Jack Ryan - two (a bit idealized) personifications of the US and Russia's intelligence services - who (we hope) will continue to keep our nations from eliminating each other (by whatever it takes, and it takes a lot!). Perhaps they even start to cooperate in earnest, because as it shown in the movie, there are new bad guys out there, new dangers in the air. Nuclear proliferation is a looming danger, aside from international terrorism. So the message of the movie is clear - only personal effort of individuals to reach out and learn about each other as much as possible will help our countries to distinguish who is true friend and who is the enemy.

It is about the ""final"" confrontation between the USA and Russia. A nuclear terrorist attack is organized in Baltimore so that the USA may believe it comes from the Russians and may start the procedure leading to a full out nuclear war. From the very start the theory that is illustrated here is that terror in the world is organized by the Israeli secret services with the help of some western autonomous adventurers and with the complicity of the hard liners in the Russian and Ukrainian armies. Then the whole story is difficult to believe because of the total lack of real believable hard facts. The American president appears as quite manipulated by his own military personnel and his State and Defense Secretaries, without speaking of the CIA. The Russian president appears just as much manipulated but with maybe a little bit more nerve. The whole plot fails because a small CIA intellectual agent manages to speak to the Russian president directly via the red telephone and make him take the decision to halt his alert, a decision that the US president immediately imitates. How can we believe that. The Weapons of Mass Destruction are quoted  in some remote small sentence somewhere unimportant but the propaganda is clear. The various actors of this plot are then eliminated one after the other in the most radical way possible. That's a shame in a way because the film is rather well made and acted but it is obvious war propaganda that supports the theory pretending the world is being manipulated if not controlled by the Israelis, a resurgence of sorts of the old hitlerian anti-semitism of old.

596757,A1EBJ93E1T50RT,B00005JL8F,Jason A. Miller,"[2, 2]","I didn't pick up ""The Sum of all Fears"" because I wanted to watch the movie.  I tried, and failed, to read the book a dozen years ago, though since then I've finished a couple of Clancy novels and seen most of the movies.  But when I heard that Clancy -- a tremendously feisty writer who posts to his own Usenet forum -- actually recorded an audio commentary for this DVD, along with the director, Phil Alden Robinson, I just had to be there.The basics of the screenplay are weird.  An elegant European neo-Nazi, with a penchant for fine wine, classical music, and a vaguely non-denominational Austrian accent, inexplicably detonates a nuclear bomb in the middle of the Super Bowl, played in Montreal's Olympic Stadium, which for the movie's purposes is located in South Baltimore.  With me so far?  Good.  Me neither.Clancy verbally abuses Robinson for most of the commentary track by telling him what the movie got wrong.  Mostly this relates to the misuse of boats and fighter planes, or incorrect military jargon.  Robinson takes it all well, calmly explaining his choices, and politely deferring to Clancy on all the minor points.  These two guys obviously share different political views, although it's odd that neither director commented on the 9/11 factor.  The book as written was a lot closer to the 9/11 scenario than the movie's watered-down plot.  Yet Clancy and Robinson never discuss the reasoning behind the change.  One of the more interesting revelations, though, is that the movie's US President (James Cromwell) is based on Michael Dukakis.  Clancy has high praise for Morgan Freeman and Liev Schrieber, but suggests that Bridget Moynihan, who plays Ben Affleck's love interest, needs to eat a couple of hot dogs every day.  Wow!When the movie's over, Robinson tells Clancy it's been ""an honor and a pleasure"".  Clancy, not missing a beat, replies, ""Well, I don't know if it was an honor"".You definitely don't want to miss this double act.",3,Most Combative Audio Commentary ever!,1048204800,"03 21, 2003",2003,1959,"['did', ""n't"", 'pick', 'up', 'Sum', 'Fears', 'wanted', 'watch', 'movie', 'tried', 'failed', 'read', 'book', 'dozen', 'years', 'ago', 'then', ""'ve"", 'finished', 'couple', 'Clancy', 'novels', 'seen', 'most', 'movies', 'when', 'heard', 'Clancy', 'tremendously', 'feisty', 'writer', 'who', 'own', 'Usenet', 'forum', 'actually', 'recorded', 'audio', 'commentary', 'DVD', 'director', 'Phil', 'Alden', 'Robinson', 'just', 'had', 'be', 'there.The', 'basics', 'screenplay', 'are', 'weird', 'elegant', 'European', 'neo-Nazi', 'penchant', 'fine', 'wine', 'classical', 'music', 'vaguely', 'non-denominational', 'Austrian', 'accent', 'inexplicably', 'nuclear', 'bomb', 'middle', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'played', 'Montreal', 'Olympic', 'Stadium', 'movie', 'purposes', 'located', 'South', 'Baltimore', 'so', 'far', 'Good', 'Me', 'neither.Clancy', 'verbally', 'Robinson', 'most', 'commentary', 'track', 'telling', 'what', 'movie', 'got', 'wrong', 'Mostly', 'misuse', 'boats', 'fighter', 'planes', 'incorrect', 'military', 'jargon', 'Robinson', 'well', 'calmly', 'explaining', 'choices', 'politely', 'deferring', 'Clancy', 'minor', 'points', 'two', 'guys', 'obviously', 'share', 'different', 'political', 'views', 'odd', 'director', 'commented', '9/11', 'factor', 'book', 'written', 'was', 'lot', 'closer', '9/11', 'scenario', 'movie', 'watered-down', 'plot', 'Clancy', 'Robinson', 'never', 'reasoning', 'change', 'One', 'more', 'interesting', 'revelations', 'movie', 'US', 'President', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'based', 'Michael', 'Dukakis', 'Clancy', 'high', 'praise', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Liev', 'Schrieber', 'Bridget', 'Moynihan', 'who', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'love', 'interest', 'eat', 'couple', 'hot', 'dogs', 'day', 'Wow', 'When', 'movie', 'Robinson', 'Clancy', 'been', 'honor', 'pleasure', 'Clancy', 'not', 'missing', 'beat', 'replies', 'Well', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'honor', '.You', 'definitely', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss', 'double', 'act']",N/A
596758,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B00005JL8F,Jason,"[1, 2]","In easily the most horrible Clancy adaptation ever, The Sum of All Fears produces not only a nuclear blast on U.S. soil, but something just as damaging: overwhelming political correctness.  The screenwriter for this film changed the villains from Islamic terrorists (something current) to a rogue neo-Nazi group (something anachronistic), and it is a completely flagrant, transparent, sanitized placation of the PC crowd.Essentially the plot involves neo-Nazis detonating a mid-football game nuke in Baltimore to goad the United States into a nuclear war with a failing Russian government.  Yeah, because there will be a lot of land and nothing but good times after the U.S. and Russia go all Jackson Pollock with nukes across the world.  Pretty stupid, huh?  Well, the problems after that are numerous.First, after dropping a nuke nobody would stick around to see their handiwork.  This is not a suicide-bomber or serial killer.  Second, could someone explain to the cast and crew what an EMP actually does?  If a massive one hits downtown Baltimore, there will not be operational handheld electronics or helicopter radios, and they certainly shouldn't be used to advance the storyline.  Speaking of the helicopter, if one gets rocked out of the sky by the concussive force of a mushroom cloud, I doubt someone is walking away, much less saving the day like Ryan.  Finally, why is Ryan still in the Baltimore/D.C. area shortly after the explosion?  Why does the movie end with him kicking his feet up in relaxation as if there isn't fallout?  It'd been more believable if he had a third eye on his forehead or looked like visitor to the bar from Total Recall.It is obvious Ben Affleck is not Jack Ryan.  Sure, he's playing a former military officer with a law degree who is employed by the CIA as a foreign affairs analyst, but he's way too young (in his late 20s when filmed) for this role.  He's neither Alec Baldwin nor Harrison Ford, two actors who actually look as if they could be Jack Ryan.  The best he could possibly hope for is to be a younger version; a mouth-breathing, late-20 something, semi-serious entry level employee who would be more comfortable at a Frat house than a political environment.  He's as miscast as Denise Richards would be playing a nuclear physicist.  (Oops!)  Come to think of it, why WASN'T she cast for that role in this movie?  It would have been just as believable.Aside from Morgan Freeman's portrayal of Bill Cabot (Director of the CIA), there wasn't much I enjoyed other than a fun scene in which Ryan misses a date with his fianc&eacute; and tells her that his boss (i.e. Cabot) needs him to board a plane to Russia instead.  Most of the time spent watching this movie involved me looking down at my watch, which is sad considering the realistic nature of the topic and source material.Jason Elin",2,Great Clancy book turned into a 1980s TV movie about Cold War paranoia,1272585600,"04 30, 2010",2010,2840,"['easily', 'most', 'horrible', 'Clancy', 'adaptation', 'ever', 'Sum', 'All', 'Fears', 'not', 'only', 'nuclear', 'blast', 'U.S.', 'soil', 'something', 'just', 'damaging', 'overwhelming', 'political', 'correctness', 'screenwriter', 'film', 'changed', 'villains', 'Islamic', 'terrorists', 'something', 'current', 'rogue', 'neo-Nazi', 'group', 'something', 'anachronistic', 'completely', 'flagrant', 'transparent', 'sanitized', 'placation', 'PC', 'crowd.Essentially', 'plot', 'neo-Nazis', 'detonating', 'mid-football', 'game', 'nuke', 'Baltimore', 'goad', 'United', 'States', 'nuclear', 'war', 'failing', 'Russian', 'government', 'Yeah', 'will', 'be', 'lot', 'land', 'nothing', 'good', 'times', 'U.S.', 'Russia', 'go', 'Jackson', 'Pollock', 'nukes', 'world', 'Pretty', 'stupid', 'huh', 'Well', 'problems', 'are', 'numerous.First', 'dropping', 'nuke', 'nobody', 'would', 'stick', 'see', 'handiwork', 'not', 'suicide-bomber', 'serial', 'killer', 'Second', 'could', 'someone', 'explain', 'cast', 'crew', 'what', 'EMP', 'actually', 'massive', 'one', 'downtown', 'Baltimore', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'operational', 'handheld', 'electronics', 'helicopter', 'radios', 'certainly', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'used', 'advance', 'storyline', 'Speaking', 'helicopter', 'one', 'rocked', 'sky', 'concussive', 'force', 'mushroom', 'cloud', 'doubt', 'someone', 'walking', 'away', 'much', 'less', 'saving', 'day', 'Ryan', 'Finally', 'why', 'Ryan', 'still', 'Baltimore/D.C', 'area', 'shortly', 'explosion', 'Why', 'movie', 'end', 'kicking', 'feet', 'up', 'relaxation', ""n't"", 'fallout', ""'d"", 'been', 'more', 'believable', 'had', 'third', 'eye', 'forehead', 'looked', 'visitor', 'bar', 'Total', 'Recall.It', 'obvious', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'not', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'Sure', 'playing', 'former', 'military', 'officer', 'law', 'degree', 'who', 'employed', 'CIA', 'foreign', 'affairs', 'analyst', 'way', 'too', 'young', 'late', '20s', 'when', 'filmed', 'role', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'two', 'actors', 'who', 'actually', 'look', 'could', 'be', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'best', 'could', 'possibly', 'hope', 'be', 'younger', 'version', 'mouth-breathing', 'late-20', 'something', 'semi-serious', 'entry', 'level', 'employee', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'comfortable', 'Frat', 'house', 'political', 'environment', 'as', 'miscast', 'Denise', 'Richards', 'would', 'be', 'playing', 'nuclear', 'physicist', 'Oops', 'Come', 'think', 'why', 'WAS', ""N'T"", 'cast', 'role', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'believable.Aside', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'portrayal', 'Bill', 'Cabot', 'Director', 'CIA', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'enjoyed', 'other', 'fun', 'scene', 'Ryan', 'date', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'boss', 'i.e', 'Cabot', 'board', 'plane', 'Russia', 'instead', 'Most', 'time', 'spent', 'watching', 'movie', 'involved', 'looking', 'down', 'watch', 'sad', 'considering', 'realistic', 'nature', 'topic', 'source', 'material.Jason', 'Elin']",N/A

It is soon buried in the sand and left unnoticed for twenty-nine years.Meanwhile, trouble has been occuring in other parts of the world as well.  The President of Russia mysteriously dies, and a new President, Nemerov, (Ciaran Hinds) takes power.  This move alerts the American CIA, especially director William Cabot (Morgan Freeman).  Nemerov is known to be a wild card, and many are unsure of his motives.  However, Jack Ryan (Ben Affleck) isn't convinced about Nemerov.  Ryan wrote a paper about Nemerov, and he seems to think that he is more conservative in his views.Directed by President Robert Fowler (James Cromwell), Cabot and Ryan are sent to Russia to check on the status of their nuclear disarmament.  Once there, they are given a tour of a Russian nuclear assembly plant.  Many renowned Russian scientists work there.  However, three have mysteriously disappeared.Back in the Middle East, two men have managed to dig up the remains of the missing nuclear bomb.  They sell them to a man named Olson (Colm Feore), who pays a mere [...] for the bomb.  Immediately, the wheels are set in motion.  The three missing Russian scientists and Olson have devised a plan to construct their own nuclear bomb, smuggle it back into the United States, and detonate it at the Super Bowl.  The detonation would lead the United States to believe that, due to the instability of the Russian government under Nemerov, the Russians would be blamed for the detonation.  Both the United states and Russia would destroy each other while the scientists and Olson sat by and watched.However, Ryan manages to put all of the pieces together and is on his way to Baltimore when the bomb is detonated.  A huge mushroom cloud covers the city, and many people are killed.  As expected, President Fowler immediately suspects that the Russians are to blame and immediately orders a counter-strike.  Thus begins a tense game of international chess; who will blink first?  Can Ryan arrive in time to stop World War III, or will he be too late?I found this to be a very exciting and entertaining movie.  The story is thrilling and very well-conceived.  The special effects are very good as well.  The attack on the American aircraft carrier was one of my favorite sequences of the film.  Morgan Freeman, Ben Affleck, and James Cromwell give fine performances.  Although I appreciated Affleck's effort, I still think Alec Baldwin (""The Hunt for Red October"") and Harrison Ford (""Patriot Games"") did a better job as Jack Ryan.I recommend this very good movie.  Although I haven't read the book yet, I plan to soon to see how well the movie compares to it.

Nick Chinlund would have been way better. And the decision to re-create Ryan into a young rookie, without setting the story in the past (it could have worked!), was just unforgiveable. The continuity of the Jack Ryan films is just tossed out in the rush to make a quick buck.That aside, I'm glad to see other people were shaking their heads at why Hollywood decided to change the villains from the Tom Clancy novel, making them into easily-hated neo-Nazis. An attempt at political correctness, perhaps, a soothing of ruffled feathers, an attempt to downplay the reality of Arab terrorism. What could have been a timely (and prophetic) film, was turned into a liberal appeasement fest.I understand why Morgan Freeman wanted his character to be killed off so he wouldn't have to do a sequel, considering the awful direction the Jack Ryan movie mythos have gone in.

Ryan funds out that a small group of terrorists plan to bomb a football game that the president (James Cromwell) will be at with a Nuke the U.S. lost 28 years ago. The terrorists want to provoke a war between the U.S. and Russia and now only Ryan can stop that from happening.Not sure why there's so many people hating on this film here as I don't think it's bad at all. I think Ben Afflick does an excellent job playing Ryan. Some people complain that Alec Baldwin wasn't brought in. But hello Baldwin is too old now to play Ryan when he's first starting out with the CIA. Well anyway Afflick is good but the whole time watching it I wanted to see more of Liev Schreiber (Scream 2, Kate & Leapold). He plays the character William Defoe played in Clear and Present Danger. I'm not sure if I'm right though but I thought Ryan and that character first just meet in Clear and Present Danger. If that's a flaw or not I'm not sure but anyway Schreiber is excellent. If there's another Ryan film I'd like to see much more of the Liev Schreiber characater in action. Ryan is  trying to stop a war between the U.S. and Russia but it's Schreiber who is actually trying to stop the terrorists who are behind it. So I sorta found him a lot more interesting than Ryan. He's someone I wouldn't mind playing as him in a Metal Gear Solid type video game, lol.Well enough about Schreiber, besides liking his character a lot I also just caught up in the whole story.

So much was changed that it could have almost been a different story regarding the antagonist in the book versus the movie.One of the key aspects that made the movie good was the tremendous performance of Morgan Freeman who was spectacular as the CIA Director.  Ben Affleck also does a good job in the movie but the role he played was a bit over the top in the end of the movie.

The bad guys are Austrians, Isrealis, and, indirectly, the U.S. military-industrial complex. I wonder what Tom Clancy thinks about that. Muslims are just innocent bystanders, and the liberals save the day, because war is all just a misunderstanding, or is caused by European nazis. This movie is shameless political correctness. The film is actually excellent, but I give it only two stars for the tired leftwing cliches. If they had filmed it based on Clancy's novel, it would have been great. I think Hollywood just copped out and got scared of portraying the Muslims as ""the enemy"", and so did what they always do: just turn the bad guys into white nazis.

I haven't read ALL of Clancy's books, and I had not read this one, so I'm not in any position to comment on being disappointed with the film 'not following' the book. Evidently it doesn't. Not having read the book, I'm not sure I care.Affleck is now the third actor to portray the character Jack Ryan, (after Alec Baldwin, and Harrison Ford.) I think he does an admirable job, given the fact that we're seeing a much younger ""Jack,"" very early in his CIA career.One reviewer complained that he isn't the 'real' Jack Ryan. I have news for you. Neither is the 'real' Jack Ryan. I noticed as the opening credits rolled, that Tom Clancy played a significant role in making the film. Since Jack Ryan is simply a figment of Clancy's fertile imagination (and I guess it didn't bother HIM that much that the character didn't precisely re-create what he had written), then it ought not bother you.Another reviewer called the movie ""fun.""FUN?! I suspect they sat in the wrong theatre by mistake. The film was superb. Suspensful. Disturbing to watch. Thought-provoking. I can't for the life of me think of a scene or scenes that one could call ""FUN.""A BRIEF WORD OF CAUTION, in fact, to anyone who lost a loved one or was otherwise DEEPLY affected by the events of September 11th. This probably is NOT the film for you. My wife and I were literally shaking as we exited the theatre, so intense (and now, believable) was the presentation of a nuclear bomb going off on US soil.No, witnessing a very graphic depiction of an atomic bomb detonating, and instantly vaporizing tens of thousands of people is certainly not ""fun."" (I should comment however, that I thought this scene, which occurs fairly late in the film, was done with an admirable amount of restraint by the filmmakers. It was not --though it could have been-- a gore-fest. Rather, it looked at the event as with averted vision. Seeing vehicles blown off a highway as if they were made of foam was probably more powerful an image than seeing a mountain of body parts. I compliment them on this decision.)All in all, I'd give the movie an extra star if I could.

I generally don't go out of my way to see an 'action' movie but I would say this one is one of the better ones. Unlike your typical action film, this one has a reasonably realistic (albeit far-fetched) plot and half-way decent dialogue. There was some amount of character development with Jack Ryan, and the movie managed to address briefly the world of academia and politic.I am not going to go into too much detail as I don't want to spoil the film for those who have not read the book. I did not read the book before the film, but have been told that the 'bad guys' in the book included Islamic militants, whereas the movie featured a neo-nazi ring-leader and various other unhappy power-hungry factions. This may have been changed to make the movie less sensitizing; watching this film will scare you, not in a transient amusement-park ride kind of way, but will make you realize how fragile our existence is. This is largely due to the credit of the sound people... the sound effects were incredible... you don't just watch the movie, you feel it through the sound.Harrison Ford surely lent an air of distinguishment as the older Jack Ryan in Clancys other book to film movies, but to play a younger Jack Ryan, I cannot think of a younger actor who would do better than Ben Affleck. He did an exceptional job, playing a very believable Jack Ryan with intelligence, determination and charm. Liev Schreiber made a very pleasing appearance as John Clark, a real switch from the time-traveling bumbling genius in Kate & Leopold. A versatile actor, he exhibits a 'je ne sais quoi' that makes him surprising, suspenseful and enjoyable to watch... always leaving you wondering what he's going to do next. The three weak points of the film were deviations from the book, the manner in which the CIA director was treated, occasional pathetic excuse for dialogue by the 'President', and a scene in which Ben Affleck wanders around a burning city making phone calls.There is a bit of James Bond smarminess about some parts of the film, which actually lighten and balance it out a little but don't go so far as to make the movie cheesy. All together, this is a balanced film that performs well in and outside of it's genre, and not a bad thing to see on a Saturday night.

596789,AFRZL05D54MPM,B00005JL8F,JWolf,"[1, 1]","""The Sum of All Fears,"" directed by Phil Alden Robertson, is a 2002 film based on Tom Clancy's novel by the same name.  This movie joins ""The Hunt for Red October,"" ""Patriot Games,"" and ""Clear and Present Danger"" as the fourth installment of the Jack Ryan series, though ""The Sum of All Fears"" rewinds to an earlier stage in the life of Jack Ryan than was depicted in the three previous films.  The Collector's Edition DVD features include ""The Making of The Sum of All Fears"" and ""Creating Reality:  The Visual Effects.""  Starring Roles include:  Ben Affleck as Jack Ryan, Morgan Freeman as William Cabot (CIA Director), James Cromwell as President Fowler, Liev Schreiber as John Clark, and Bridget Moynahan as Catherine Muller.Discrepancies between the book and film are addressed in the DVD extras, most notably that the film's terrorists are neo-fascists as opposed to the Arab nationalist terrorists described in the novel.  Since the movie did not release until 2002 (presumably because it fit best as a summer movie), many speculated that this change-of-antagonist was a reaction to the events of 9-11-2001, yet filming had wrapped by June of 2001.  Robertson explains in the DVD extras that neo-fascists fit the terrorists' role better due to vast resources necessary to carry out the acts portrayed in the film.Unfortunately for Ben Affleck, he follows Harrison Ford's performance as Jack Ryan and, according to critics, fails to fill Harrison's shoes with the same authenticity.  On a surface level, the film is packed with action, thrills, and good acting; the more negative reviews take jabs at the film's lack of depth and character development, which is a difficult medium to work with for any actor.  In light of mixed reviews, the movie raked in about $240 million at the box office.SUMMARY:  The opening scene shows a Syrian man unearthing an unexploded Israeli nuke which he later sells to Olson, a weapons trader from South Africa.  Olson makes a considerable profit on the long-lost bomb by reselling it to billionaire Richard Dressler, head of neo-Nazi terrorist group.  In the meantime, Russia names Aleksandr Nemerov their new president following the mysterious death of his successor.Back in the U.S., Jack Ryan, a CIA analyst with special knowledge of Aleksandr Nemerov, is called to accompany CIA Director William Cabot to Moscow.  Nemerov greets the men slyly, but is foreboding when he warns Cabot not to let the U.S. become involved in the Chechnyan war.  While inspecting a Russian nuclear facility, Ryan notices discrepancies between the facility's roster and the scientists actually present; Cabot later reveals (by virtue of his Kremlin inside-man) to Ryan that the missing scientists are actually evading the Russian government.Upon their return to the U.S., Cabot dispatches John Clark to find the absent scientists.  Clark follows their trail to the Ukraine where the scientists are believed to be working on an untraceable Russian nuke.  After breaking into the old Soviet military facility, Clark discovers the crate from Olson's nuke and that the missing scientists have been assassinated.Jack, in an attempt to atone for a missed date with Dr. Catherine Muller, takes her to the Correspondents' Association Dinner at the White House.  In the midst of the party, word reaches the press that a chemical weapons attack in Chechnya has occurred.  An emergency briefing takes place at the White House in which Ryan attempts to convince the National Security Council that Nemerov was not involved in the ordering of the attack (the act is a ploy by Dressler to entice the U.S. and Russia into a nuclear war).Ryan is finally able to track the location of the missing nuke to Baltimore, where Cabot and President Fowler are attending a football game; they barely escape the blast with their lives, though Cabot is left in critical condition.  From the nuke's isotopic signature, Ryan learns that this was not a Russian nuke and confirms his suspicion that war between the U.S. and Russia is being staged.  Ryan goes on a scavenger hunt to find the origin of the nuke; in Syria, Ryan learns that the bomb was sold to Olson which allows the techies back at Langley to tie the Baltimore attack to Dressler.Meanwhile, the U.S. and Russia are preparing to engage in airstrikes against one another.  In an effort to prevent all-out war, Ryan takes it upon himself to contact Nemerov and attempt to explain the misinterpretations between the U.S. and Russia.  In a leap of faith, Nemerov agrees and both militaries stand down.  All the loose ends are tied up during the conclusion, which may be the funniest and cleverest part of the movie so I won't spoil it.",3,Adventurous Prequel,1382918400,"10 28, 2013",2013,4685,"['Sum', 'All', 'Fears', 'directed', 'Phil', 'Alden', 'Robertson', '2002', 'film', 'based', 'Tom', 'Clancy', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'movie', 'Hunt', 'Red', 'October', 'Patriot', 'Games', 'Clear', 'Present', 'Danger', 'fourth', 'installment', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'series', 'Sum', 'All', 'Fears', 'earlier', 'stage', 'life', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'was', 'depicted', 'three', 'previous', 'films', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'include', 'Making', 'Sum', 'All', 'Fears', 'Creating', 'Reality', 'Visual', 'Effects', 'Starring', 'Roles', 'include', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'William', 'Cabot', 'CIA', 'Director', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'President', 'Fowler', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'John', 'Clark', 'Bridget', 'Moynahan', 'Catherine', 'Muller.Discrepancies', 'book', 'film', 'are', 'addressed', 'DVD', 'extras', 'most', 'notably', 'film', 'terrorists', 'are', 'neo-fascists', 'opposed', 'Arab', 'nationalist', 'terrorists', 'described', 'novel', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'release', '2002', 'presumably', 'fit', 'best', 'summer', 'movie', 'many', 'speculated', 'change-of-antagonist', 'was', 'reaction', 'events', '9-11-2001', 'yet', 'filming', 'had', 'wrapped', 'June', '2001', 'Robertson', 'DVD', 'extras', 'neo-fascists', 'fit', 'terrorists', 'role', 'better', 'due', 'vast', 'resources', 'necessary', 'carry', 'out', 'acts', 'portrayed', 'film.Unfortunately', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'performance', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'according', 'critics', 'fails', 'fill', 'Harrison', 'shoes', 'same', 'authenticity', 'surface', 'level', 'film', 'packed', 'action', 'thrills', 'good', 'acting', 'more', 'negative', 'reviews', 'take', 'jabs', 'film', 'lack', 'depth', 'character', 'development', 'difficult', 'medium', 'work', 'actor', 'light', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'movie', 'raked', 'about', '240', 'million', 'box', 'office.SUMMARY', 'opening', 'scene', 'Syrian', 'man', 'unearthing', 'unexploded', 'Israeli', 'nuke', 'later', 'Olson', 'weapons', 'trader', 'South', 'Africa', 'Olson', 'considerable', 'profit', 'long-lost', 'bomb', 'reselling', 'billionaire', 'Richard', 'Dressler', 'head', 'neo-Nazi', 'terrorist', 'group', 'meantime', 'Russia', 'Aleksandr', 'Nemerov', 'new', 'president', 'following', 'mysterious', 'death', 'successor.Back', 'U.S.', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'CIA', 'analyst', 'special', 'knowledge', 'Aleksandr', 'Nemerov', 'called', 'accompany', 'CIA', 'Director', 'William', 'Cabot', 'Moscow', 'Nemerov', 'men', 'slyly', 'foreboding', 'when', 'Cabot', 'not', 'let', 'U.S.', 'become', 'involved', 'Chechnyan', 'war', 'inspecting', 'Russian', 'nuclear', 'facility', 'Ryan', 'discrepancies', 'facility', 'roster', 'scientists', 'actually', 'present', 'Cabot', 'later', 'reveals', 'virtue', 'Kremlin', 'inside-man', 'Ryan', 'missing', 'scientists', 'are', 'actually', 'evading', 'Russian', 'government.Upon', 'return', 'U.S.', 'Cabot', 'John', 'Clark', 'find', 'absent', 'scientists', 'Clark', 'trail', 'Ukraine', 'where', 'scientists', 'are', 'believed', 'be', 'working', 'untraceable', 'Russian', 'nuke', 'breaking', 'old', 'Soviet', 'military', 'facility', 'Clark', 'crate', 'Olson', 'nuke', 'missing', 'scientists', 'have', 'been', 'assassinated.Jack', 'attempt', 'atone', 'missed', 'date', 'Dr.', 'Catherine', 'Muller', 'Correspondents', 'Association', 'Dinner', 'White', 'House', 'midst', 'party', 'word', 'press', 'chemical', 'weapons', 'attack', 'Chechnya', 'occurred', 'emergency', 'briefing', 'place', 'White', 'House', 'Ryan', 'attempts', 'convince', 'National', 'Security', 'Council', 'Nemerov', 'was', 'not', 'involved', 'ordering', 'attack', 'act', 'ploy', 'Dressler', 'entice', 'U.S.', 'Russia', 'nuclear', 'war', '.Ryan', 'finally', 'able', 'track', 'location', 'missing', 'nuke', 'Baltimore', 'where', 'Cabot', 'President', 'Fowler', 'are', 'attending', 'football', 'game', 'barely', 'escape', 'blast', 'lives', 'Cabot', 'left', 'critical', 'condition', 'nuke', 'isotopic', 'signature', 'Ryan', 'was', 'not', 'Russian', 'nuke', 'suspicion', 'war', 'U.S.', 'Russia', 'being', 'staged', 'Ryan', 'scavenger', 'hunt', 'find', 'origin', 'nuke', 'Syria', 'Ryan', 'bomb', 'was', 'sold', 'Olson', 'techies', 'back', 'Langley', 'tie', 'Baltimore', 'attack', 'Dressler.Meanwhile', 'U.S.', 'Russia', 'are', 'preparing', 'engage', 'airstrikes', 'one', 'effort', 'prevent', 'all-out', 'war', 'Ryan', 'contact', 'Nemerov', 'attempt', 'explain', 'misinterpretations', 'U.S.', 'Russia', 'leap', 'faith', 'Nemerov', 'militaries', 'stand', 'down', 'loose', 'ends', 'are', 'tied', 'up', 'conclusion', 'may', 'be', 'funniest', 'cleverest', 'part', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil']",N/A

596797,A3UXQLM9I775JJ,B00005JL8F,"Kristofer Sandlund ""The Storyteller""","[0, 0]","...One of my favorite movies; however, I am not a Tom Clancy reader. I've always believed a movie cannot live up to a novel- it is a different form of medium, and the human imagination, inspired by excellent prose, is a powerful, enriching, and vast experience. Nevertheless, this movie stands on its own for what it is- an entertaining well crafted and politically relevant movie....If you are a fan of a certain other CIA movie, &#34;The Good Shepard&#34;, this is vastly different, and by different I mean Matt Damon different, who trashes America every chance he gets. His vitriol towards the CIA is obvious. Ironically, now it is &#34;his guy&#34; misusing power in every way possible....Tom Clancy's &#34;Jack Ryan&#34; is certainly to the &#34;right&#34; ideologically, and there is validity to that criticism- he's a straight up &#34;boy scout&#34;, yet I believe his portrayal is far closer to the norm than Mr. Damon's....Look at the real life current events playing out- right now:...Unlike the Sum Of All Fears, there is no question that Putin is a &#34;hard line old school KGB&#34; leader. That may not seem alarming to the liberal professors at most major universities; however, imagine how an average &#34;pro-west&#34; citizen of Ukraien feels right about now? The threat may not be primarily nuclear, but Russia will most certainly occupy her is the near future. I'm not a prophet- Putin is hell bent on reforming the USSR, one piece at a time, and he has repeatedly and publically stated just that! &#34;Nationalism&#34; is a driving force in Russia, especially amongst their young people....The movie also expresses the desire of Europe to move out of the role of &#34;a protected child&#34;.For different reasons from SOAF's, they understand that there is no longer an assurance of peace from the United States, whose military, including it's navy is being downsized dramatically. Most Americans seem to agree with this- &#34;we can't police the world&#34; is a phrase I hear frequently. This view is not without merit, but the consequences are frightening. I recently talked with a former Ukrainian physician, whose father was a chief military surgeon at the time of Chernobyl. The Russian's most certainly poisoned their first pro-west political leader- it wasn't a nuclear bomb in Baltimore- it was nuclear sushi in London! (Not kidding!) He ages 50 years in 12 months....I also spoke with a man from Mongolia. This country has found great natural resources over the past decade, including coal, natural gas and oil. They are VERY nervous about Russia. They have no military to speak of... Their only real protection is an international  friendship with.. guess who? You got it- the USA. Our embassy there is a major source of comfort for the Mongolian people. Hmmm, think about Benghazi!...American political leadership and clout is all but non-existent- the polar opposite of what is portrayed in SOAF. Putin scoffs at our president, who &#34;played his hand&#34; very early in the Crimean conflict. He stated we WLL NOT use any military force if Russia invades the Ukraine. Many Americans agree, and that's OK- we are a democracy, or at least used to be; however, the president of the most powerful nation on earth should not have revealed his hand so easily. His comments reveal weakness and incredible naivety....The movie even delves into the powder-keg of our time- the Israeli Muslim conflict- listed by many as the most likely scenario for the start of WW III. (Once again- not kidding) It goes like this: Israel makes a first strike on Iran- hitting their nuclear production sites- obviously to prevent a nuclear attack- similar (or worse) to the fictional nuclear bomb in Baltimore seen in SOAF's. In the recent past, Iran and her neighbors, save Iraq, hesitate to invade, as was attempted in 1973: SOAF's opening references this war, where Egypt & Syria attempted to wipe Israel off the map. America, a &#34;former&#34; friend of Israel, played a key role in aiding Israel- without hesitation....But wait a minute...  TODAY...Do we hesitate? Will America come to Israel's aide or not? Will our president give another speech on how &#34;This is simply not done in the 21st century&#34;.

The novels seem to have better gadgetry development than they do character development. I have found that I usually like the movie version better than the book. Hunt for Red October is the exception to the rule. The book was as good as the movie was.""The Sum of all Fears"" was a mixed bag for me. I really could not see Ben Affleck as Jack Ryan. Jack Ryan is older, as Harrison Ford is older.The cold war is over. As we move toward embracing mother Russia and her people I wondered how a movie based on cold war ideologies would play. It almost worked for me. The Nazis pitting the Russians against the Americans was plausable enough. Affleck as Ryan was not. Oh, the acting was good. The scenes shot in Moscow were superb. The storyline was thrilling. And Morgan Freeman was as good in this movie as he was in High Crimes. But Affleck is too young to be a believe Jack Ryan.The Muslim terrorists of the novel have been replaced with European neo-Nazi terrorists. The reason is, that prior to 9/11, there was a move away from portraying Muslims as terrorist, because of protests by Arab-American groups.

This is a review of the movie.  So let's start with what was good.  The acting was excellent.  The script was good.  The casting was top notch.  So why didn't this movie get 5 stars?I think perhaps the biggest problem was one the book did not have.  A lack of suspense.  A lack of that feeling that you just have to know what is going to come next.  I never felt the sense of urgency or of political gesturing spinning so far out of control that over ego politicians would sacrifice the whole world.  Nor did I feel that vast sense of loss that the book evoked when a nuclear weapon leveled part of the USA.  I read the book pre 9/11.  It was the first time I had ever considered what a real attack on the USA would be like.  Now, well, I am not so naive, but I wish this movie had brought back that sense of pain and shock.  Maybe it was a breakdown of editing.I miss Clancy's incredible ability to weave disparate plot lines into an amazing and page-turning story.  I haven't found anyone who could do that as well as he did in this novel.  The movie was too level, no ups and downs, not enough emotional investment in what was happening.  Never the less, it was good.  I recommend it.

The two picks for the American and Russian president are right-on--Ciaran Hinds as the Russian president is really excellent, as is James Cromwell as his American counterpart. And the guy who plays the CIA operative is good, too (unfortunately I don't know the actor's name). But anyway, he's a pretty cool cat in this movie, and just what you'd expect of an experienced field agent.Also, the scene in which Affleck tells his fiance that he can't make their date because Morgan Freeman, the head of the CIA, wanted Affleck to jump on a plane to Russia with him is nicely done.

During the opening scene the movie actually seems like it might be watchable.  Then everything goes right down the can for good and all.  What's that?  You want examples?  Well, again, maybe I'm just nuts, but I just can't sit still for one more movie make out scene where big name actor and actress unconvincingly, passionlessly grope eachother and then kiss eachother openmouthed without tongues.  I mean what IS that?!?!  Its like the make-out equivalent of those movie telephone numbers that all start with 555 in order to give you to understand that its fake, not real, so you don't go out to the lobby and dial the number because you've got nothing else to do and you wind up bothering some old lady in Phoenix.  But exactly what prank are we prevented from by the fake french kissing?  And, if there is some law that stipulates that people in movies can't french kiss, then why bother at all?  Are the audience members supposed to count themselves lucky they got on board with this picture because now they're sitting there in the theater and there's kinda sorta some almost making out?  Anybody who gets turned on by this crudola has got more serious problems than going to a movie is going to solve.Then, there's the matter of dialog.  For example a scene in which Ben Affleck's girlfriend - whom he's just been fake-kissing - is at her post as a med student, scrubbing up before some nameless operation with another female med student who is asking about Affleck's job.  Now, first of all, isn't this talking while scrubbing up scene a bit run into the ground?  I mean do we have to see it yet one more time because the screenwriter just couldn't be bothered to think of something original?  And THEN... so the girlfriend tells her coworker that Affleck is a historian.  THe coworker, who is obviously supposed to be a highly educated if not intelligent person says ""Ya-awn!"" as if she is twelve years old and palling around with her idiot friends at the local mall.  I mean listen, maybe this person is a piece of garbage, but she as a med student must be no stranger to the mind-numbing tedium of endless details that must be crammed into one's brain to get that big degree.

596818,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,B00005JL8F,Martin Asiner,"[4, 7]","When THE SUM OF ALL FEARS was first released, the ads on television kept showing the same sequence again and again: an explosion of a nuclear device in America.  Naturally, the audience assumed that this was a movie that had an atomic bomb as the dramatic center, and that the film would focus on the results of that detonation.  Instead, what director Phil Robinson presented was a carefully crafted movie that asks the viewer to forget a few things while watching.  Robinson uses the unexpectedly fine acting of Ben Affleck, who plays a very junior CIA agent Jack Ryan, to divert the audience's attention from both some hugely noticeable plot gaffes and variations from Tom Clancy's novel. Clancy originally pictured the terrorists as Moslem extremists, and in the pre 9/11 political correctness, Robinson did not wish to alienate our many Moslem friends worldwide by suggesting that any of them could wish harm to America. Instead, he switches the villains to neo-Nazis, since even PC supporters do not hold them in high regard.  As one of these German terrorists was expounding his beliefs for the camera, he spoke in the same Teutonic cadences that used to characterize Erich von Stroheim back in the 40s.  All that this German failed to do was to stroke his mustache a la Snidely Whiplash.  Further, Robinson avoids the consequences of the logic reached by the Nazi terrorists, who believe that when they cause America and Russia to destroy one another in nuclear war, a resurgent regime of national socialism will take root in Germany to control what is left of the world.  Unfortunately, neither director Robinson nor these Nazi wannabes have remembered that the thousands of nuclear devices that will surely be used in any massive exchange of weapons of mass destruction must surely prove as harmful to the world at large as it would to the two combatants.  Yet it is to Affleck's credit that his youthful earnestness and good looks that he can divert attention from those shortcomings to a more conventional thriller in which a ticking clock is the antagonist.  The explosion itself lasts but a few seconds nor does the film focus on its after effects.  What the movie does accomplish is to get the viewer involved in the improbable trail of clues that leads Affleck to the terrorists who have convinced the presidents of both the United States and Russia that each is plotting the destruction of the other.  The movie shows the inner workings of advisors of both countries.  It is not surprising that the American and Russian military leaders are far more alike in a sense of misplaced macho than they are in anything else.  Both the American president and his Russian counterpart see an escalating series of confrontations as no more than a game of chicken played out on an international stage, with each daring the other to knock off a chip from their shoulders. By the close of the credits, the audience is left with the uncomfortable feeling that if all that stands between mutually assured nuclear annihilation and world continuity is the grit of such youngsters as Jack Ryan, then the inner message of the film becomes clear enough: if world leaders have to choose between fear and calculation as the basis for planning escalated responses to external aggression, then both leaders had better develop a healthy sense of fear of the consequences that cool calculation might otherwise entail.",3,A Movie Less About Fear than about Calculation,1037491200,"11 17, 2002",2002,3407,"['When', 'SUM', 'OF', 'ALL', 'FEARS', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'ads', 'television', 'kept', 'showing', 'same', 'sequence', 'again', 'again', 'explosion', 'nuclear', 'device', 'America', 'Naturally', 'audience', 'assumed', 'was', 'movie', 'had', 'atomic', 'bomb', 'dramatic', 'center', 'film', 'would', 'focus', 'results', 'detonation', 'Instead', 'what', 'director', 'Phil', 'Robinson', 'presented', 'was', 'carefully', 'crafted', 'movie', 'viewer', 'forget', 'few', 'things', 'watching', 'Robinson', 'unexpectedly', 'fine', 'acting', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'who', 'very', 'junior', 'CIA', 'agent', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'divert', 'audience', 'attention', 'hugely', 'noticeable', 'plot', 'gaffes', 'variations', 'Tom', 'Clancy', 'novel', 'Clancy', 'originally', 'pictured', 'terrorists', 'Moslem', 'pre', '9/11', 'political', 'correctness', 'Robinson', 'did', 'not', 'wish', 'alienate', 'many', 'Moslem', 'friends', 'worldwide', 'suggesting', 'could', 'wish', 'harm', 'America', 'Instead', 'villains', 'neo-Nazis', 'even', 'PC', 'supporters', 'do', 'not', 'hold', 'high', 'regard', 'one', 'German', 'terrorists', 'was', 'expounding', 'beliefs', 'camera', 'spoke', 'same', 'Teutonic', 'cadences', 'used', 'characterize', 'Erich', 'von', 'Stroheim', 'back', '40s', 'German', 'failed', 'do', 'was', 'stroke', 'mustache', 'la', 'Snidely', 'Whiplash', 'Further', 'Robinson', 'consequences', 'logic', 'reached', 'Nazi', 'terrorists', 'who', 'believe', 'when', 'cause', 'America', 'Russia', 'destroy', 'one', 'nuclear', 'war', 'resurgent', 'regime', 'national', 'socialism', 'will', 'take', 'root', 'Germany', 'control', 'what', 'left', 'world', 'Unfortunately', 'director', 'Robinson', 'Nazi', 'wannabes', 'have', 'remembered', 'thousands', 'nuclear', 'devices', 'will', 'surely', 'be', 'used', 'massive', 'exchange', 'weapons', 'mass', 'destruction', 'must', 'surely', 'prove', 'as', 'harmful', 'world', 'large', 'would', 'two', 'combatants', 'Affleck', 'credit', 'youthful', 'earnestness', 'good', 'looks', 'can', 'divert', 'attention', 'shortcomings', 'more', 'conventional', 'thriller', 'ticking', 'clock', 'antagonist', 'explosion', 'few', 'seconds', 'film', 'focus', 'effects', 'What', 'movie', 'accomplish', 'get', 'viewer', 'involved', 'improbable', 'trail', 'clues', 'Affleck', 'terrorists', 'who', 'have', 'convinced', 'presidents', 'United', 'States', 'Russia', 'plotting', 'destruction', 'other', 'movie', 'inner', 'workings', 'advisors', 'countries', 'not', 'surprising', 'American', 'Russian', 'military', 'leaders', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'alike', 'sense', 'misplaced', 'macho', 'are', 'anything', 'else', 'American', 'president', 'Russian', 'counterpart', 'see', 'escalating', 'series', 'confrontations', 'more', 'game', 'chicken', 'played', 'out', 'international', 'stage', 'daring', 'other', 'knock', 'off', 'chip', 'shoulders', 'close', 'credits', 'audience', 'left', 'uncomfortable', 'feeling', 'mutually', 'assured', 'nuclear', 'annihilation', 'world', 'continuity', 'grit', 'such', 'youngsters', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'then', 'inner', 'message', 'film', 'clear', 'enough', 'world', 'leaders', 'have', 'choose', 'fear', 'calculation', 'basis', 'planning', 'escalated', 'responses', 'external', 'aggression', 'then', 'leaders', 'had', 'better', 'develop', 'healthy', 'sense', 'fear', 'consequences', 'cool', 'calculation', 'might', 'otherwise', 'entail']",N/A

It's fun to watch Jack develop. His inexperience here is refreshing, as he once again is put into combat situations he should never be in.On the other hand, the movie wusses out. The bad guys are a coalition of Neo-nazis and other random weird, mean European guys. It just seems fabricated, which is odd when every other aspect of the movie strives to be so accurately detailed. I mean, it's like they gave us the Legion of Doom as a set of villains (psst, that's the worst fear -- the sum of all our little fears put together, get it?).The plan is to force America and Russia into a war of escalation, by setting off strikes that appear to be initiated by the other side. We know now that, even after September 11 with a Republican President who uses words like ""Dead or Alive"" and ""crusade"" -- even HE didn't start lobbing nuclear missiles or even ordering strikes on other countries. Still, this is supposed to be a different time (precisely what time, we're not sure, but maybe it's the 1980s) and political tempers flare more easily.Then there's the strange jiggery-pokery played with Ryan's background. If you watch the ""making of"" on the DVD, the director uses the words ""franchise"" and ""reinvigorate"" and...hyuk...hyuk...BLEEEEEARGH!Sorry, I just threw up all over those terms. Obviously, continuity is sacrificed so that they can make more money off of Jack Ryan. He's in good company -- I mean, look what they did with Batman. Oh wait...I do respect the decision not to show the nuclear explosion. The director manages to really keep the tension high. And the budding relationship between Jack and his future wife is believable. When characters die, we feel bad for them. All of that makes it a really good movie.

596830,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,B00005JL8F,"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner""","[0, 1]","Ben Affleck is not the most likely actor you would expect to see playing CIA agent Jack Ryan from the famous Tom Clancy novels. But whether you like him or not, he is the third actor to take on the role after Alec Baldwin in The Hunt for Red October and Harrison Ford in Patriot Games and Clear & Present Danger and it will be interesting to see how the film fares out. Not for the sake of Affleck's ability to take on the role but to see if a film with a story so deeply involved on terrorism can succeed. Though the villains in the film had been changed from Muslim terrorists from the novel to Neo-Nazis, this decision was made before the September 11th attacks and kind of represents our innocence back then. If the film pays off in the end, perhaps studios will be less reluctant to release films in genre like they are now.The story for the fourth film based on the Jack Ryan series finds the famous Tom Clancy character at a much younger age then in the previous theatrical efforts and showcases his early start in the CIA. Jack Ryan is recruited to the CIA program by Bill Cabot after the president of Russia dies and is replaced by a man the United States does not know about and therefore fears. The only thing they have on him is the report that Ryan wrote on him years ago. After a bomb goes off during the Super Bowl in Baltimore, Ryan must get the right information to the president before a conflict between Russia and the United States ignites World War III. The story for The Sum of All Fears holds together pretty well and the reason may be because it is based on a best selling novel with little changes made overall. Despite this being a lower budgeted effort then Attack of the Clones or The Scorpion King, the story for this film is ten times better then the more budgeted fare.Though the cast really only carries two big names, those being Affleck and Freeman, the cast is put together well with plenty of lesser known, but exceedingly more talented, actors. Ben Affleck, who has had a series of unmemorable films including Reindeer Games and Bounce, takes over for Harrison Ford in the role of Jack Ryan and, quite frankly, doesn't do bad of job. Affleck certainly proves the critics wrong about his range of acting by showing much more emotion then previous efforts like Armageddon and Pearl Harbor. Morgan Freeman is, once again, wonderful and one has to wonder if there will be a role that he can't pull off. James Cromwell comes off effectively as the President of the United States who is faced with decision of whether to push the button or not. Obviously the emotions are extremely intense in this feature and the delightful cast of characters make the film all the more so though they aren't as great the leading roles, which can be expected from time to time in films of this nature.Overall, The Sum of All Fears, despite some eerie unintentional reflections of September 11th, manages to hold its ground with such explosive material. At the time the film was released, India and Pakistan were near nuclear war and the United States was involved in the war on terrorism with the horrible images of the World Trade Center attacks still embedded in our minds. With those events in mind the release of this film may seem a bit controversial but they actually help make the film more realistic and message it expresses is more efficiently produced because of that. The Sum of All Fears awakens people to the real problems in the world and may give some people the incentive to join government programs like the military or the CIA. If a film can inspire young movie-going to achieve a promising job then that film deserves some praise. Certainly not as exciting as the other summer efforts but an overall good popcorn thriller.",4,The Moose Hole - 'Fears' Realized,1072828800,"12 31, 2003",2003,3756,"['Ben', 'Affleck', 'not', 'most', 'likely', 'actor', 'would', 'expect', 'see', 'playing', 'CIA', 'agent', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'famous', 'Tom', 'Clancy', 'novels', 'like', 'not', 'third', 'actor', 'take', 'role', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Hunt', 'Red', 'October', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Patriot', 'Games', 'Clear', 'Present', 'Danger', 'will', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'film', 'out', 'Not', 'sake', 'Affleck', 'ability', 'take', 'role', 'see', 'film', 'story', 'so', 'deeply', 'involved', 'terrorism', 'can', 'succeed', 'villains', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'changed', 'Muslim', 'terrorists', 'novel', 'Neo-Nazis', 'decision', 'was', 'made', 'September', '11th', 'attacks', 'kind', 'innocence', 'back', 'then', 'film', 'end', 'perhaps', 'studios', 'will', 'be', 'less', 'reluctant', 'release', 'films', 'genre', 'are', 'now.The', 'story', 'fourth', 'film', 'based', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'series', 'famous', 'Tom', 'Clancy', 'character', 'much', 'younger', 'age', 'then', 'previous', 'theatrical', 'efforts', 'early', 'start', 'CIA', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'recruited', 'CIA', 'program', 'Bill', 'Cabot', 'president', 'Russia', 'dies', 'replaced', 'man', 'United', 'States', 'not', 'know', 'therefore', 'fears', 'only', 'thing', 'have', 'report', 'Ryan', 'wrote', 'years', 'ago', 'bomb', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'Baltimore', 'Ryan', 'must', 'get', 'right', 'information', 'president', 'conflict', 'Russia', 'United', 'States', 'World', 'War', 'III', 'story', 'Sum', 'All', 'Fears', 'together', 'pretty', 'well', 'reason', 'may', 'be', 'based', 'best', 'selling', 'novel', 'little', 'changes', 'made', 'overall', 'being', 'lower', 'budgeted', 'effort', 'then', 'Attack', 'Clones', 'Scorpion', 'King', 'story', 'film', 'ten', 'times', 'better', 'then', 'more', 'budgeted', 'cast', 'really', 'only', 'two', 'big', 'names', 'being', 'Affleck', 'Freeman', 'cast', 'put', 'together', 'well', 'plenty', 'lesser', 'known', 'exceedingly', 'more', 'talented', 'actors', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'who', 'had', 'series', 'unmemorable', 'films', 'including', 'Reindeer', 'Games', 'Bounce', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'role', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'quite', 'frankly', ""n't"", 'do', 'bad', 'job', 'Affleck', 'certainly', 'critics', 'wrong', 'range', 'acting', 'showing', 'much', 'more', 'emotion', 'then', 'previous', 'efforts', 'Armageddon', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'once', 'again', 'wonderful', 'one', 'wonder', 'will', 'be', 'role', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pull', 'off', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'off', 'effectively', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'who', 'faced', 'decision', 'push', 'button', 'not', 'Obviously', 'emotions', 'are', 'extremely', 'intense', 'feature', 'delightful', 'cast', 'characters', 'make', 'film', 'more', 'so', 'are', ""n't"", 'great', 'leading', 'roles', 'can', 'be', 'expected', 'time', 'time', 'films', 'nature.Overall', 'Sum', 'All', 'Fears', 'eerie', 'unintentional', 'reflections', 'September', '11th', 'hold', 'ground', 'such', 'explosive', 'material', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'India', 'Pakistan', 'were', 'near', 'nuclear', 'war', 'United', 'States', 'was', 'involved', 'war', 'terrorism', 'horrible', 'images', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'attacks', 'still', 'embedded', 'minds', 'events', 'mind', 'release', 'film', 'may', 'seem', 'bit', 'controversial', 'actually', 'help', 'make', 'film', 'more', 'realistic', 'message', 'more', 'efficiently', 'produced', 'Sum', 'All', 'Fears', 'people', 'real', 'problems', 'world', 'may', 'give', 'people', 'incentive', 'join', 'government', 'programs', 'military', 'CIA', 'film', 'can', 'inspire', 'young', 'movie-going', 'achieve', 'promising', 'job', 'then', 'film', 'praise', 'Certainly', 'not', 'as', 'exciting', 'other', 'summer', 'efforts', 'overall', 'good', 'popcorn', 'thriller']",N/A
596831,AURZ4YQ270W3T,B00005JL8F,Mike Freed,"[3, 6]","Viewed simply as a political/military thriller, ""The Sum of All Fears"" is a taut, well-acted, very effective movie. The film, based on a Tom Clancy techno-thriller, concerns a terrorist plot by European neo-Nazis to light off a nuclear weapon in America. Their reasoning is that America would blame the Russians automatically, and World War III would ensue, clearing the playing field for a Nazi takeover of Europe.I have all kinds of intellectual problems with that premise, which I'll go into in greater depth later, but in the aftermath of September 11, it's safe to say that the events depicted here are every American's worst nightmare come true. Given that this movie was made before September 11, I don't if the filmmakers were aiming for this kind of resonance, but they achieved it nonetheless.Stepping back and viewing ""The Sum of All Fears"" strictly as an entertainment, it's pretty close to a home run. It is suspenseful, smart, and even humorous at times. Like the other Clancy novels brought to the big screen, the hero is Jack Ryan (an effective Ben Affleck), a CIA analyst who always seems to get thrown into operations more suited for field spies. However, unlike the earlier Clancy-based movies, Ryan isn't married with kids - he's a twenty-something guy who's just beginning his CIA career, and his analysis of the new Russian government gains the notice of the CIA director, William Cabot (Morgan Freeman).Soon, Ryan is on his way to Moscow to do a weapons inspection (and UN-bashers, take note: he doesn't do a very good job either), much to the disappointment of his girlfriend Cathy, who has no idea what her man does for a living and is disappointed over being blown off. The payoff for this subplot comes when Ryan is on a plane somewhere over the Atlantic, and has to break a date with Cathy. He doesn't think he can let her in on his ""secret"" profession, but Cabot gives him the green light, and Ryan spills the beans. Of course, Cathy doesn't buy it, which provides the movie's best humorous moment.Strong supporting performances in ample supply, most prominently from James Cromwell, who plays the president, and Liev Schreiber as Mr. Clark, a nice enough guy who you better pray never comes calling for you. The sets have an authentic feel about them, and the visual effects are well-done.Most importantly, the payoff scene - the detonation of the nuclear weapon - is completely effective, despite being less graphic and detailed than depictions in other films (notably ""Terminator 2""). Instead, director Phil Alden Robinson chooses to use timing and the shock value of the event itself, not detailed depictions of the bomb's effects, as a dramatic device, and it works very well. It probably saved him a few million in special effects as well, but if it works, why not?One thing that doesn't work in ""The Sum of All Fears"" is the depiction of military action, especially the attack on an American carrier. It was far too easy for the Russians to hit the carrier with missiles, which is something Tom Clancy points out on the commentary track. In reality, the closest those bombers would have gotten, especially in a wartime environment, would have been a picture in ""Jane's Fighting Ships.""Come to think of it, what this movie really lacks is the kind of detail that Clancy's novels always come with, but then again, Clancy's tendency towards verbal diarrhea and constant Dittohead blathering are mercifully left out. In a two-hour movie, I suppose that's a good balance.Much has also been made of the producers' decision to replace the villains in the book version (Arabs, a German terrorist, and an American Indian) with neo-Nazis was based on political correctness, a charge the producers deny. Bunk, I say - it's obvious to me that the last people on Earth who would start an all-out nuclear war between Russia and America would be Europeans. A look at the map tells you why - Russia IS a European country, after all. Why would they poison their own continent?I suspect replacing Arabs as the villain was as much a financial consideration as anything else - the Middle East is an important market for Hollywood, and while Europeans wouldn't skip this movie because it concerns European neo-Nazis (they have little love for Nazis, neo or not), Middle Easterners would certainly complain about having Arabs depicted as bloodthirsty terrorists, particularly after September 11.But that carping aside, ""The Sum of All Fears"" delivers the goods - action, political intrigue, and a very relevant cautionary tale that should have us all thinking twice. Early in the movie, there's an exchange between the president and Cabot about the Russians. The president is worried about the Russians, who have 27,000 nuclear weapons pointed in our direction. ""I'm worried about the guy with one,"" replies Cabot.Worried, indeed. More like scared to death.",4,"Exciting, very relevant political/military thriller",1043193600,"01 22, 2003",2003,4871,"['Viewed', 'simply', 'political/military', 'thriller', 'Sum', 'All', 'Fears',

I have news for these people, its a free country and there is no law that says anyone has to make a movie utterly cloned to what was in a book.  Its perfectly legal to use our own creative talents and I even encourage people to use their gifts in such ways, after all, its how we get great poets and such by allowing free thinking. Perhaps those people would be happier living in a communist country. that said, the movie does have a few small things that I myself might have done better, but if its going to keep you from buying and watching this fun movie then you mustn't use sugar or salt etc. on any of your foods because it will change the flavor. I'm kidding of course, the point is, the movie is fine just how it is and we are all entitled to our opinions, but the movie is still a great flick which I watch at least twice a year, and I own over 2000 movies to pick from yet this one is a classic to me.

Acknowledging that this is an action movie, I gave it the benefit of the doubt, but was disappointed to see that virtually all the characters, in almost all situations were one dimensional; there is absolutely no depth to them. This movie is so formulaic. It's as if the creators sat down with a list of ""exciting"" ideas and plot twists and threw this thing together. And, as always, the good guy saves the day. This was simply the most unrealistic, and often the most boring, movie of this type I've ever had the displeasure to watch. Let's put it this way, last night I watched a relatively bad movie on TBS called Atomic Twister and it was much more engaging and overall a better picture than the Sum of All Fears.The fact that the American population is loving this boring homage to mediocrity is a sad, sad commentary on the state of affairs. Save your money and rent a video. If you want one from this genre, pick something like Air Force One or Saving Private Ryan. Better yet, save all your money and camp out on your couch until TBS airs Atomic Twister again, which, based on their past treatment of ""original"" movies, is probably in another 15 minutes.

The result: I was right.  It's not a bad a story, Clancy does an admirable job with his book, but the movie is not like his book, it's entirely different only copying the main premise of having a nuke brought to the US.OK, it's believable that a nuke gets recovered and sold around to certain violent factions.  I'm not so sure if it makes sense that a nuke from an Israeli war is likely to be found because none were planned to be used.  That wasn't a war that would've called for a nuke, considering how Israel kicked Egypt's and Syria's ass.  So I think it would've been more believable if the nuke came from the old Soviet Union which has ""misplaced"" about a third to half of their nukes.Let's talk about the bad guys.  The bad guys are pointless.  You don't know who they are, they have no real development, they are let downs in villains.  And naturally they are Nazis.  Of all the most over-used form of organized villainy it's Nazis.  In the 1930's it makes sense, but late 20th century?  Um, no.  Why not have a different organization?  Be original if you're not going to follow Clancy's book which used Islamic extremists.Now the acting.  My word, how the heck is Affleck even an actor?  I haven't seen such a poor job of acting since Keanu Reeves in Devil's Advocate.  This guys sucks eggs, he has no likeable personality, no charisma, no anything.  Harrison Ford had a subtle, but radiant personna that made him stand out, Affleck just has his youth and a million screaming fans.  I don't see how this guy was casted as Ryan but it was a huge error because he plays a poor one.  Affleck comes across as a boy still in high school who's working lawn mower jobs to pay for his first car.  He hardly comes across as a ""man"" doing a ""man's job.""  Go back to starring in films like Gigli or whatever the hell it's called, Ben, because you can't act.  For the bucks this guy gets, I could do better.  He doesn't seem comfortable in a role where the good guy must have some balls and act on principle, such as Ford did so wonderfully when he played Ryan.  I'm trying to think who's a worse Ryan: Affleck or Baldwin.  Both sucked because neither of them have the captivating talents that Ford does when the camera is on him.  Affleck is a bomb, it's not a wonder why his films go down the drain.Yikes, and where's Anne Archer when you need her?  This young chick playing her character is awful.  Katherine Ryan is a character who is serious minded, yet sarcastic and playful, and very encouraging with Jack.  This girl has none of that.  It sounds to me that this was another mis-cast of character and they put some babe to play a role that demanded a ""woman"" to play a ""woman's role"" not some little girl still in her teenybopper stages as she runs around a hospital making stupid quips.The casting and acting of this film is horrindous, that costed two stars.  The third star it lost was plot and realism.  I had a hard time believing that the events that unfolded would be possible.  The idea of Russian scientists, with no particular motive, helping Nazis is insane.  The idea that the President of the USA would threaten to nuke Russia just because of a hunch is stupid.  The reality of this film is non-existant.  All this film is, unfortunately, is poor choiced hype.  Directors wanted to make a disaster movie, post 9/11, so they borrowed Clancy's idea.  They gave it hype.  They starred a heart throb Ben Affleck.  All this movie is is sensationalism.  That's all and it doesn't live up to it as most movies don't.I do not recommend this film, I've seen better and it could've been better.  If you want good Clancy films see Clear and Present Danger or Patriot Games, there characters have some personality and development.  With this film, there is no development, just quips and hype.  It's the sum of bad sensationalism.Grade: D+",2,Sum of bad acting,1078963200,"03 11, 2004",2004,3959,"['Sum', 'fears', 'movie', 'right', 'beginning', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'total', 'let', 'down', 'waste', 'see', 'result', 'was', 'right', 'not', 'bad', 'story', 'Clancy', 'admirable', 'job', 'book', 'movie', 'not', 'book', 'entirely', 'different', 'only', 'copying', 'main', 'premise', 'having', 'nuke', 'brought', 'US.OK', 'believable', 'nuke', 'recovered', 'sold', 'certain', 'violent', 'factions', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'sure', 'sense', 'nuke', 'Israeli', 'war', 'likely', 'be', 'found', 'none', 'were', 'planned', 'be', 'used', 'was', ""n't"", 'war', 'would', ""'ve"", 'called', 'nuke', 'considering', 'how', 'Israel', 'kicked', 'Egypt', 'Syria', 'ass', 'think', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'more', 'believable', 'nuke', 'came', 'old', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'misplaced', 'third', 'half', 'nukes.Let', 'talk', 'bad', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'pointless', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'are', 'have', 'real', 'development', 'are', 'let', 'downs', 'villains', 'naturally', 'are', 'Nazis', 'most', 'over-used', 'form', 'organized', 'villainy', 'Nazis', '1930', 'sense', 'late', '20th', 'century', 'Um', 'Why', 'not', 'have', 'different', 'organization', 'Be', 'original', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'follow', 'Clancy', 'book', 'used', 'Islamic', 'extremists.Now', 'acting', 'My', 'word', 'how', 'heck', 'Affleck', 'even', 'actor', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'poor', 'job', 'acting', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'Devil', 'Advocate', 'guys', 'eggs', 'likeable', 'personality', 'charisma', 'anything', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'had', 'subtle', 'radiant', 'personna', 'made', 'stand', 'out', 'Affleck', 'just', 'youth', 'million', 'screaming', 'fans', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'guy', 'was', 'casted', 'Ryan', 'was', 'huge', 'error', 'poor', 'one', 'Affleck', 'boy', 'still', 'high', 'school', 'who', 'working', 'lawn', 'mower', 'jobs', 'pay', 'first', 'car', 'hardly', 'across', 'man', 'doing', 'man', 'job', 'Go', 'back', 'starring', 'films', 'Gigli', 'hell', 'called', 'Ben', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'bucks', 'guy', 'could', 'do', 'better', ""n't"", 'seem', 'comfortable', 'role', 'where', 'good', 'guy', 'must', 'have', 'balls', 'act', 'principle', 'such', 'Ford', 'did', 'so', 'wonderfully', 'when', 'played', 'Ryan', ""'m"", 'trying', 'think', 'who', 'worse', 'Ryan', 'Affleck', 'Baldwin', 'sucked', 'have', 'captivating', 'talents', 'Ford', 'when', 'camera', 'Affleck', 'bomb', 'not', 'wonder', 'why', 'films', 'go', 'down', 'drain.Yikes', 'where', 'Anne', 'Archer', 'when', 'need', 'young', 'chick', 'playing', 'character', 'awful', 'Katherine', 'Ryan', 'character', 'who', 'serious', 'minded', 'sarcastic', 'playful', 'very', 'encouraging', 'Jack', 'girl', 'none', 'was', 'mis-cast', 'character', 'put', 'babe', 'play', 'role', 'demanded', 'woman', 'play', 'woman', 'role', 'not', 'little', 'girl', 'still', 'teenybopper', 'stages', 'hospital', 'making', 'stupid', 'quips.The', 'casting', 'acting', 'film', 'horrindous', 'costed', 'two', 'stars', 'third', 'star', 'lost', 'was', 'plot', 'realism', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'believing', 'events', 'unfolded', 'would', 'be', 'possible', 'idea', 'Russian', 'scientists', 'particular', 'motive', 'helping', 'Nazis', 'insane', 'idea', 'President', 'USA', 'would', 'threaten', 'nuke', 'Russia', 'just', 'hunch', 'stupid', 'reality', 'film', 'non-existant', 'film', 'unfortunately', 'poor', 'choiced', 'hype', 'Directors', 'wanted', 'make', 'disaster', 'movie', 'post', '9/11', 'borrowed', 'Clancy', 'idea', 'gave', 'hype', 'starred', 'heart', 'throb', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'movie', 'sensationalism', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'most', 'movies', ""don't.I"", 'do', 'not', 'recommend', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'better', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'want', 'good', 'Clancy', 'films', 'see', 'Clear', 'Present', 'Danger', 'Patriot', 'Games', 'characters', 'have', 'personality', 'development', 'film', 'development', 'just', 'quips', 'hype', 'sum', 'bad', 'sensationalism.Grade', 'D+']",N/A
596839,A1YHKSTVSYEYTU,B00005JL8F,Mr. N. Carnegie,"[26, 41]","The Sum of All Fears is the fourth film and in my opinion best film so far based on Tom Clancy's spy thrillers featuring the ever-reluctant hero Jack Ryan, now played by (a much more age appropriate) Ben Affleck.The plot of this movie revolves around a neo-fascist group, led by a nasty Alan Bates, trying to provoke a nuclear war between Russia and America by exploding a nuclear device on American soil (Baltimore, to be precise). It stars Ben Affleck as a younger Ryan, pre-marriage and pre Hunt For Red October, being taken under the wing of fatherly CIA director Morgan Freeman. I know there have been some very mixed reviews for this movie but much to my pleasant surprise I really enjoyed this movie and found it to be totally gripping and an excellent edge of the seat thriller.The Sum of all Fears is directed by Phil Alden Robinson, who previously directed the wonderful Field of Dreams, and he brings a lot more depth, subtlety and humour to both the characters and the plot development than Phillip Noyce previously managed in either of the last two Ryan movies (Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger), not to mention the other clunkers on Noyce's r&eacute;sum&eacute;, including The Saint, Sliver and The Bone Collector (excellent novel, terrible adaptation). In fact it's a wonder this franchise has survived Phillip Noyce and that Noyce still has a career (although apparently his latest movie Rabbit Proof fence is actually very good).As for the cast, I feel that Affleck is a perfect choice and that he has at last found a decent role in a decent movie. Perhaps his first decent role since Good Will Hunting, which he co-wrote with Matt Damon, and certainly much much better than the dreadful Titanic-alike Pearl Harbour. Morgan Freeman is of course reliably excellent as always and has some of the best lines in the whole movie as CIA boss Bill Cabot but there are also other excellent supporting performances from the likes of Liev Schrieber as a covert CIA operative, James Cromwell (as a belligerent U.S. President), Ciar&aacute;n Hinds as Russian President Nemerov and Alan Bates as the chief villain. However I can't say I was totally convinced with Bridget Moynahan as Ryan's girlfriend, Dr Cathy Mueller. Although one thing's for sure, she is very pleasant to look at and there were some excellent shared scenes between her and Affleck. I just didn't find her very convincing in her white coat playing a surgeon.In summary, I cannot think of a mainstream Hollywood thriller that I've enjoyed so much in a long time and many of the people I know that have also seen this film were equally as thrilled. I can honestly say that it was a pleasant surprise to enjoy this so much and that this is definitely one of the best films I've seen all year. Highly recommended!

And here we thought they had fallen at the end of WWII. ...And so, The Sum of all Fears hands us an all too familiar racist stereotype: the ""evil white foreigner"" trying to- what else?- enslave mankind and enthrone a white supremicist government.But our hero, Jack Ryan, is onto them. He ends up saving the world from those jerks, with only a few hundred (thousand) casualties from that darned nuclear blast. In spite of the vast carnage (none of which we see) we get a nice, clean happy ending. Hey, its only a nuke. What were you expecting? Economic depression? Mass rioting? Come on, this is Jack Ryan here!As a white person,  I find all this white supremicist paranoia downright offensive.  If hollywood were to make a film about black militant terrorists, people would understandably be offended, as no such group exists.  Why are whites (especially Germans and Austrians) not irate about this type of film?No one was upset about films like Schindlers List for depicting Nazis as fiends.  NO ONE SHOULD HAVE BEEN, because Speilberg told the truth, and even understated their horrific barbarism.So why is hollywood  so concerned about telling the truth about eastern terrorism?Skip this one.

The performances of Ben Affleck (""Changing Lanes"") and Morgan Freeman (""High Crimes"") couldn't be better! The film talks about how one nuclear weapon comes up missing from a total of 27,000. It is up to CIA analyst Jack Ryan (Affleck) and CIA Director Bill Cabot (Freeman) to uncover the plot or else, it's World War III!! ""The Sum of All Fears"" also talks about how fear can escalate to paranoia in this world today due to the fact of wars and nuclear weapons. To me, Ben Affleck is the absolute best Jack Ryan since Harrison Ford in ""Patriot Games"" and ""Clear and Present Danger"", and Alec Baldwin in ""The Hunt for Red October""! And when I watched ""The Sum of All Fears"", I would like to think of this as a prequel to the first 3 films because of Jack Ryan being a little young in this film.

Now admittedly, I haven't read the book yet -- it's been sitting on my shelf waiting for me to get to it for far too long -- so I'll do my mea culpa right now if the answers to my concerns are already duly explained.The most glaring issue for me was, where does this movie fit chronologically with the other Jack Ryan films?  It starts with a background scene from the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, and then jumps to ""29 years later"", which means the main story would be set in 2002.  However, instead of the ""married with children"" Jack Ryan that we saw in ""Patriot Games"" and ""Clear and Present Danger"", we find a young, single Jack Ryan (played by Ben Affleck) who is still essentially an unknown nobody at the CIA.  We also get introduced to a similarly youthful Jack Clark, of ""Rainbow Six"" fame.  I'm not sure if these anachronistic gymnastics were intentional or not, but I found it more than a bit distracting as I watched this film.  To borrow a phrase from Kelly Bundy, the whole thing ""wobbles the mind.""Aside from that, though, it was a typical Tom Clancy technothriller, chock full of high suspense from start to finish.  This one resurrects the spectre of nuclear warfare between the U.S. and post-Soviet Russia after a neo-Fascist terror cell unleases a low-yield nuke in Baltimore, then sets about to make it look like it was a Russian attack.  As predicted, the U.S. response only serves to up the ante until the two nations stand teetering at the brink of mutual annihilation.In the meantime, the young Jack Ryan follows his uncanny instincts to unravel the puzzle in a fast-paced, action-filled plot line that never eases up the tension.  The special effects for the nuclear blast are very well done indeed.  However, the sight of Ryan traipsing around near ground zero apparently without any harmful side effects from the radiation is just a teensy oversight in the realism department.Overall I cannot say I was at all disappointed by these above lapses, just puzzled.  The story itself was, as are all the Clancy films, gripping and suspenseful.

However, &#34;The Sum of All Fears&#34; is good enough it makes you suspend your disbelief.It is gripping, the first half shows the building of an intricate puzzle and the second half is a nail-biter watching the characters try to solve it before mutually assured destruction happens.I do think this will appeal more to those of us old enough to remember what life was like before the Berlin Wall came down, when the threat of nuclear war was ever-present in the back of your mind. Marrying it with the post-9/11 fear of smaller nukes (aka &#34;suitcase nukes&#34; the CIA's own fanfiction of international espionage) brings together the old black & white us vs. them of the age of Russian communism with the modern fear of fractionalized terrorists.It's no &#34;Three Days of the Condor&#34; but it's a well-paced story, has great, believable action, and some damn fine acting.

Freeman could very well have been speaking to Affleck in a real-life conversation in reference to acting.  Freeman's mere presence runs circles around Affleck's attempts to act.  Unfortunately, that is one negatives that prevents ""Sum..."" from being more of a landmark movie.  I struggled with the decision over whether to give this movie 3 or 4 star.  In the end, the acting deficiencies by some of main characters and some of the too-convenient plot devices, caused me to settle on 3 stars.While Affleck's acting left something to be desired, I can't be totally critical of his performance.  He really did try.  He put forth as workman-like an effort as anyone could hope for.  He just simply does not have the talent or presence to fill the formidable shoes of an action hero like Jack Ryan.  Action hero roles are proving to be a difficult type of acting.  Add to that the premise of this movie, a nuclear attack on Baltimore followed by mounting tensions between the U.S. and Russia in its aftermath, and you have a tall order for any actor to fill.  The true acting disaster in this movie belongs to Bridget Moynahan who plays his girl friend (soon-to-be wife) Cathy Muller.  Moynahan's most notable previous work was as one of the dancing waitresses in ""Coyote Ugly"", not exactly a stellar pedigree.  Maybe in time she will improve as an actress, but in ""Sum of All Fears"", Moynahan shows absolutely no acting or emotional range.  Baltimore is in ruins, her boyfriend is off risking his life to prevent a full-scale nuclear war, she has to deal with nuclear victims at her hospital and her expression would make one think she was annoyed at missing a sale at Macy's, not that she has just witnessed one of the greatest tragedies visited upon U.S. soil.Having said my piece about two the main leads, let me focus now on the rest of the movie.  The plot for ""Sum of All Fears"" is a very sobering one (and one that several real-life experts find to be very plausible).  With the fall of the Soviet Union and the rise to nuclear power status of many Middle East nations, it's not inconceivable that a terrorist cell could get their hands on a single nuclear weapon and transport it to the United States.  In this movie, an Israeli jet equipped with a nuclear bomb is shot down during a skirmish between Israel and some of its Arab neighbors in 1973.  Fast forward a few decades and the bomb has been unearthed by some scavengers who are unaware of its true purpose.  A group of Nazi-loyalists track down the rogue bomb and procure it for their purposes.  The purposes being destroying a major U.S. city and making it appear that Russia was behind it in order to start a full scale nuclear war between to the two nations.  In the aftermath, the Nazi's plan to use the chaos to reclaim worldwide power (at least that seems to be the plan.  It's not extraordinarily clear).  The concept of a nuclear terrorist attack is a very scary, very real scenario that hits home even harder in the aftermath of 9/11 and the discovering of an Al-Qaeda member planning to set off a radioactive 'dirty bomb'.  This situation is handled with appropriate degrees of plausibility.  The suddenness of the nuclear detonation in Baltimore combined its signature shockwaves and mushroom cloud are visions that are horrifying to view makes one hope to never have to in real life.  The reactions by the President (played ably by James Cromwell) and the rest of his cabinet seem very real and very human.  They aren't ice-cold, calm, and calculating in determining how to respond to this devastation.  They react emotionally, confused, and frustrated.  It is how one would expect leaders to react behind closed doors during such a tremendous crisis.  One would think President Bush and his advisors had moments similar to those in the movie in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks.  The rising tension as one incident after another pushes the U.S. and Russia closer to nuclear war is palpable.  It's frightening to see how, for the right money and opportunity, such plans can come to fruition.""Sum of All Fears"" is a well-done movie and will leave the audience captivated as they watch the progression of events.  There is just a feeling, though, that this movie could have been something more with different casting choices.",3,Faulty acting can't quite undermine terrifying tale,1024444800,"06 19, 2002",2002,4558,"['scene', 'early', 'Sum', 'All', 'Fears', 'where', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'character', 'Bill', 'Cabot', 'deputy', 'CIA', 'director', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'now', 'young', 'CIA', 'turk', 'pay', 'attention', 'are', 'breath', 'air', 'way', 'pay', 'grade', 'Freeman', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'speaking', 'Affleck', 'real-life', 'conversation', 'reference', 'acting', 'Freeman', 'mere', 'presence', 'runs', 'circles', 'Affleck', 'attempts', 'act', 'Unfortunately', 'one', 'prevents', 'Sum', 'being', 'more', 'landmark', 'movie', 'struggled', 'decision', 'give', 'movie', '3', '4', 'star', 'end', 'acting', 'deficiencies', 'main', 'characters', 'too-convenient', 'plot', 'devices', 'caused', 'settle', '3', 'stars.While', 'Affleck', 'acting', 'left', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'totally', 'critical', 'performance', 'really', 'did', 'try', 'put', 'forth', 'workman-like', 'effort', 'anyone', 'could', 'hope', 'just', 'simply', 'not', 'have', 'talent', 'presence', 'fill', 'formidable', 'shoes', 'action', 'hero', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'Action', 'hero', 'roles', 'are', 'proving', 'be', 'difficult', 'type', 'acting', 'Add', 'premise', 'movie', 'nuclear', 'attack', 'Baltimore', 'followed', 'mounting', 'tensions', 'U.S.', 'Russia', 'aftermath', 'have', 'tall', 'order', 'actor', 'fill', 'true', 'acting', 'disaster', 'movie', 'Bridget', 'Moynahan', 'who', 'girl', 'friend', 'soon-to-be', 'wife', 'Cathy', 'Muller', 'Moynahan', 'most', 'notable', 'previous', 'work', 'was', 'one', 'dancing', 'Coyote', 'Ugly', 'not', 'exactly', 'stellar', 'pedigree', 'Maybe', 'time', 'will', 'improve', 'actress', 'Sum', 'All', 'Fears', 'Moynahan', 'absolutely', 'acting', 'emotional', 'range', 'Baltimore', 'ruins', 'boyfriend', 'risking', 'life', 'prevent', 'full-scale', 'nuclear', 'war', 'deal', 'nuclear', 'victims', 'hospital', 'expression', 'would', 'make', 'one', 'think', 'was', 'annoyed', 'missing', 'sale', 'Macy', 'not', 'just', 'witnessed', 'one', 'greatest', 'tragedies', 'visited', 'U.S.', 'soil.Having', 'said', 'piece', 'two', 'main', 'leads', 'let', 'focus', 'now', 'rest', 'movie', 'plot', 'Sum', 'All', 'Fears', 'very', 'sobering', 'one', 'one', 'several', 'real-life', 'experts', 'find', 'be', 'very', 'plausible', 'fall', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'rise', 'nuclear', 'power', 'status', 'many', 'Middle', 'East', 'nations', 'not', 'inconceivable', 'terrorist', 'cell', 'could', 'get', 'hands', 'single', 'nuclear', 'weapon', 'transport', 'United', 'States', 'movie', 'Israeli', 'jet', 'equipped', 'nuclear', 'bomb', 'shot', 'down', 'skirmish', 'Israel', 'Arab', 'neighbors', '1973', 'Fast', 'forward', 'few', 'decades', 'bomb', 'been', 'unearthed', 'scavengers', 'who', 'are', 'unaware', 'true', 'purpose', 'group', 'Nazi-loyalists', 'track', 'down', 'rogue', 'bomb', 'procure', 'purposes', 'purposes', 'being', 'destroying', 'major', 'U.S.', 'city', 'making', 'appear', 'Russia', 'was', 'order', 'start', 'full', 'scale', 'nuclear', 'war', 'two', 'nations', 'aftermath', 'Nazi', 'plan', 'use', 'chaos', 'reclaim', 'worldwide', 'power', 'least', 'be', 'plan', 'not', 'extraordinarily', 'clear', 'concept', 'nuclear', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'very', 'scary', 'very', 'real', 'scenario', 'home', 'even', 'harder', 'aftermath', '9/11', 'discovering', 'Al-Qaeda', 'member', 'planning', 'set', 'off', 'radioactive', ""'dirty"", 'bomb', 'situation', 'handled', 'appropriate', 'degrees', 'plausibility', 'suddenness', 'nuclear', 'detonation', 'Baltimore', 'combined', 'signature', 'shockwaves', 'mushroom', 'cloud', 'are', 'visions', 'are', 'horrifying', 'view', 'one', 'hope', 'never', 'have', 'real', 'life', 'reactions', 'President', 'played', 'ably', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'rest', 'cabinet', 'seem', 'very', 'real', 'very', 'human', 'are', ""n't"", 'ice-cold', 'calm', 'calculating', 'determining', 'how', 'respond', 'devastation', 'react', 'emotionally', 'confused', 'frustrated', 'how', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'leaders', 'react', 'closed', 'doors', 'tremendous', 'crisis', 'One', 'would', 'think', 'President', 'Bush', 'advisors', 'had', 'moments', 'similar', 'movie', 'aftermath', '9/11', 'attacks', 'rising', 'tension', 'one', 'incident', 'U.S.', 'Russia', 'closer', 'nuclear', 'war', 'palpable', 'frightening', 'see', 'how', 'right', 'money', 'opportunity', 'such', 'plans', 'can', 'come', 'fruition', 'Sum', 'All', 'Fears', 'well-done', 'movie', 'will', 'leave', 'audience', 'captivated', 'watch', 'progression', 'events', 'just', 'feeling', 'though', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'something', 'more', 'different', 'casting', 'choices']",N/A

596858,A307LZV1TBCJJO,B00005JL8F,phimseto,"[1, 1]","During the Cold War, some of the best cinema sprung up in the form of cautionary tales that echoed the fears of the period. ""Fail Safe"", ""Seven Days in May"", ""The Day After"", and even ""Dr. Strangelove"" took the complex issues of the day and, as only Hollywood can, put them into perspective. Today, with America engaged in a war against terrorism, ""The Sum of All Fears"" arrives as the first film to tackle subject matter relevant to this current struggle.In the annals of cinema, Jack Ryan has become the techno-thriller version of the Griswold kids from the ""Vacation"" series - each film finds him at a different age and circumstance. In this go around, Jack has found the Fountain of Youth, reverting from Harrison Ford's weathered idealist who isn't afraid to confront authority into Ben Affleck's fresh-faced idealist who isn't afraid to confront authority. Some constants, it would seem, remain.Another constant, and certainly for the better, is in the casting of Jack's superior. James Earl Jones' Admiral Cutter has given way to Morgan Freeman's Director Cabot, which is fine since both men fall into the ""a film with them just reading the phone book aloud would be interesting"" category. Other casting choices for major roles do not fare as well. Liev Schreiber is miscast as Clancy's shadow operative John Clark, especially when contrasted with Willem Dafoe's portrayal of the same character (and even that one was poorly adapted from the novel). James Cromwell puts in a rote performance as President Fowler, going through the same motions that he did in ""Eraser"", all scowls, sliminess, and bluster, something that suited the vapidness of a Schwarzenegger vehicle but is like a hammer hit repeatedly over the head in this morality play. The two small upsides are Philip Baker Hall, who really only inhabits that brooding in-the-know character he plays so well, and Ciar&aacute;n Hinds, an Irishman whose Russian Premier would have made Peter Bull (""Dr. Strangelove""'s Ambassador de Sadesky) proud.The downfall of ""The Sum of All Fears"" is twofold. First is in their adaptation of the source material. Anyone familiar with Clancy's novel of the same name knows that the terrorists attempting to set off a nuke in the USA are Islamic extremists. With today's war on terrorism, where American citizens face the very real possibilities of nuclear and biological attack, the movie could have been a lightning rod for both reminding Americans why they are at war and for putting the spotlight on the breakdowns in intellegence and communication that let determined fanatics slip through the cracks.Instead, the movie, in very contemptible PC fashion, changes the antagonists from Islamic terrorists to (of all things) neo-fascists. That's right - the NAZIs are out to nuke Baltimore, and their costumes come complete with vintage hidden Swastika insignia rings. Even if a viewer can resist laughing at the concept, there is no allowance for taking it seriously. Thus, the event of terrorism is disturbing in and of itself, but lacks the underlying, contemporary insights that would have made for a visceral, jarring, and educating experience.Indeed, it is this dodging of the edgy and most important aspect of the book that makes the major flaw of Clancy's original book all the more unbearable. This review could have been called ""A Preachy Book Becomes A Preachy Movie"". Jack Ryan plays the modern Cassandra the whole way through, though the time constraints of moviemaking mercifully cull out most of the extended political commentary found in the book. However, the third act of the film mirrors the last act of the book, featuring a ham-fisted President exhibiting the intellectual depth of Duke Nukem blathering about to a soundtrack consisting of long-winded Jack Ryan monologues and declaratives. This material, even as unrefined and obvious as it was in the book, had relevance in the novel given the relation between terrorists and the populations they hide in. In the film, where the...ahem...neo-fascists take a page from the SPECTRE playbook to incite war between Russia and the USA, the preaching and hand wringing clang loudly off the hollow artifice that is the plot.The movie gets two-stars for being an accomplished and well-shot production, as well as for some of the actors in the film. However, the film is really only a one-star excursion for a single reason. For the filmmakers to shoot this material, release this movie, and cover these topics while the USA is at war over similar circumstances, the American public deserves a braver film. By eliminating the elements that tie in all the story's issues to today's news, what could have been a transcendent adaptation of a standard techno-thriller became a mailed-in summer lightweight production of average Tom Clancy fare. Instead of ""Fail Safe"", we get ""Whoops Apocalypse"". ""The Sum of All Fears"" is a wasted opportunity that could have been the right movie for the right times.",2,Wrong Movie for the Right Times,1022630400,"05 29, 2002",2002,4960,"['Cold', 'War',

It just doesn't put them together the right way.Redefining Tom Clancy's character Jack Ryan (Ben Affleck) as a younger CIA officer at the bottom rung of the ladder, it's the story of a missing nuke discovered by radicals who wish to dominate by manipulating the United States and Russia into war. The idea is intriguing, and there are some fun action scenes when disaster strikes, but it never seems to reach the depths of political intrigue and tension that The Hunt for the Red October and other great genre films had. It just falls somewhere in the middle between political intrigue and mindless action flick. Much of this is probably due to the editing the novel had to go through to make this two-hour film. The novel's near 1,000 pages make it difficult to translate without making it feel rushed. If Sum of all Fears had an additional twenty minutes (which would still be a suitable length for the American public to sit through), it would allow for more intelligence, political debate and tension building.Still, its hard to not find some entertainment here. Morgan Freeman in a supporting role as a presidential aid and James Cromwell as the president put their great talent to use, and though Ben Affleck is no gift from the acting gods, he is able to hold his own with the heavyweights. And while most scenes leave you unsatisfied, they still build up some excitement and tension in their diluted state.This ones best seen as a rental except for the Jack Ryan film completists.

The pacing is amazingly well done for a movie this long.  The action and tension are well managed by the director and the actors play their parts very well.Affleck is decent as Jack Ryan, though we are spared any long soliloquy that would stretch his range as an actor.  Morgan Freeman plays his standard 'old, wizened black mentor' role effectively.I did think that a little more insight to the mentality of the President's advisers was needed.  They didn't all seem to be pro or anti-nuke, and it would have been nice to get some background on where they come from.

596870,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00005JL8F,Reviewer,"[0, 1]","""The Sum of All Fears,"" directed by Phil Alden Robinson, is a cautionary tale that is thought provoking and all too valid, especially in the wake of 9/11.The screenplay was adapted by Paul Attanasio and Daniel Pyne from the novel by Tom Clancy; the story is a proposition of what could happen if a nuclear bomb fell into the wrong hands, how the preeminent governments of the world would respond and what the outcome would mean to the average citizen living in the Ukraine or in Podunk, U.S.A.  It's a hypothetical situation that, quite frankly, a few years ago would've been perceived by most as being as close to reality as ""The Martian Chronicles.""  But not anymore.  Looking beyond the drama of the story and the way it's presented, the actual events depicted here are almost too close for comfort and will no doubt evoke a sense of denial in many viewers who still refuse to accept the state of the world as it is today.The film itself is, of course, a big budget, Hollywood production-- which in not a BAD thing-- but as such the drama is a bit stiff and stilted at times, and the presentation by director Robinson lacks originality and imagination; too often we see exactly what we expect (when a member of the Russian cadre, for example, demurs to the cold reality of their plan and announces his withdrawal, we know that he's signed his own death warrant.  Seeing him garroted by the silent, hulking henchman before he reaches the door is anticlimactic; it would have been entirely more effective had Robinson taken a page from David Lean's Book and left it up to the viewer's imagination).  But the performances are to the last actor solid and convincing, and late in the film the story takes a decidedly unexpected turn that allows for a suspenseful climax; after a point you can speculate as to the final outcome, but you cannot know absolutely until the very end. >The real strength of the film, though, lies in the very honest depiction of the events and the way they play out, from the unimaginable success of the terrorists to the confusion, uncertainty and irresolution of those in power. >As Jack Ryan, Ben Affleck gives an acceptable performance, and though he's convincing he lacks the intensity of his predecessor in the role, Harrison Ford, or even that of Alec Baldwin, who first created the character in 1990's ""The Hunt for Red October.""  Buy this is a younger Jack Ryan, new to the C.I.A. and not yet married, which may provoke some confusion in fans of this series, as on one hand this story predates ""October,"" and yet the events seem to reflect more recent incidents, subsequent to all that happened in the first three ""Ryan"" films.  P>The most notable performances are turned in by Morgan Freeman (Cabot) Liev Schreiber (Clark), Philip Baker Hall (Defense Secretary Becker) and Ron Rifkin (Owens).But in the final analysis, ""The Sum of All Fears"" says something about who we are, ""where"" we are and the state of the world in which we live today; things we would probably rather not contemplate, but nevertheless, must.",4,"A Thought Provoking Contemplation of ""Where"" We Are Today",1037404800,"11 16, 2002",2002,3048,"['Sum', 'All', 'Fears', 'directed', 'Phil', 'Alden', 'Robinson', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'thought', 'provoking', 'too', 'valid', 'especially', 'wake', '9/11.The', 'screenplay', 'was', 'adapted', 'Paul', 'Attanasio', 'Daniel', 'Pyne', 'novel', 'Tom', 'Clancy', 'story', 'proposition', 'what', 'could', 'happen', 'nuclear', 'bomb', 'fell', 'wrong', 'hands', 'how', 'preeminent', 'governments', 'world', 'would', 'respond', 'what', 'outcome', 'would', 'mean', 'average', 'citizen', 'living', 'Ukraine', 'Podunk', 'U.S.A', 'hypothetical', 'situation', 'quite', 'frankly', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'perceived', 'most', 'as', 'being', 'close', 'reality', 'Martian', 'Chronicles', 'not', 'anymore', 'Looking', 'drama', 'story', 'way', 'presented', 'actual', 'events', 'depicted', 'here', 'are', 'almost', 'too', 'close', 'comfort', 'will', 'doubt', 'evoke', 'sense', 'denial', 'many', 'viewers', 'who', 'still', 'refuse', 'accept', 'state', 'world', 'today.The', 'film', 'course', 'big', 'budget', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'not', 'BAD', 'thing', 'such', 'drama', 'bit', 'stiff', 'stilted', 'times', 'presentation', 'director', 'Robinson', 'originality', 'imagination', 'too', 'often', 'see', 'exactly', 'what', 'expect', 'when', 'member', 'Russian', 'cadre', 'example', 'cold', 'reality', 'plan', 'withdrawal', 'know', 'signed', 'own', 'death', 'warrant', 'Seeing', 'garroted', 'silent', 'hulking', 'henchman', 'door', 'anticlimactic', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'entirely', 'more', 'effective', 'had', 'Robinson', 'taken', 'page', 'David', 'Lean', 'Book', 'left', 'up', 'viewer', 'imagination', 'performances', 'are', 'last', 'actor', 'solid', 'convincing', 'late', 'film', 'story', 'decidedly', 'unexpected', 'turn', 'suspenseful', 'climax', 'point', 'can', 'speculate', 'final', 'outcome', 'can', 'not', 'know', 'absolutely', 'very', 'end', '>', 'real', 'strength', 'film', 'though', 'very', 'honest', 'depiction', 'events', 'way', 'play', 'out', 'unimaginable', 'success', 'terrorists', 'confusion', 'uncertainty', 'irresolution', 'power', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'acceptable', 'performance', 'convincing', 'intensity', 'predecessor', 'role', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'even', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'who', 'first', 'created', 'character', '1990', 'Hunt', 'Red', 'October', 'younger', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'new', 'C.I.A', 'not', 'yet', 'married', 'may', 'provoke', 'confusion', 'fans', 'series', 'one', 'hand', 'story', 'October', 'yet', 'events', 'seem', 'reflect', 'more', 'recent', 'incidents', 'subsequent', 'happened', 'first', 'three', 'Ryan', 'films', 'P', '>', 'most', 'notable', 'performances', 'are', 'turned', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Cabot', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'Clark', 'Philip', 'Baker', 'Hall', 'Defense', 'Secretary', 'Becker', 'Ron', 'Rifkin', 'Owens', '.But', 'final', 'analysis', 'Sum', 'All', 'Fears', 'something', 'who', 'are', 'where', 'are', 'state', 'world', 'live', 'today', 'things', 'would', 'probably', 'rather', 'not', 'contemplate', 'nevertheless', 'must']",N/A

The trouble is that it philosophically eviscerates the best Tom Clancy Jack Ryan story to date. Ben Affleck isn't bad as a younger Cold War-era Ryan, Morgan Freeman brings his usual dignity to the role of Jack's boss Cabot. But I hated the scene where Ryan tells med student girlfriend Cathy Muller about his unexpected line-of-duty trip to Moscow on the phone in-flight, and she responds in the manner of an overpossessive brat (who do you think you are standing me up?) and hanging up in Jack's ear. Go pick up the book and tell me if this is anything like the Dr. Cathy Ryan you'll read about there. It's more than the change in maturity of one woman at two different phases of her life--the two Cathys are two completely different people. God help this Cathy if she had the book Cathy as a med school instructor--she'd get told to grow the hell up yesterday. A person who's going to be a doctor needs more self control than that. This is not Tom Clancy's classy, courageous Dr. Caroline Ryan by a country mile. But I'm saving the more obvious critique for last. Who in the world decided that it was wrong to have the bad guys remain the Mideast terrorist cell under the direction of a successor to the Ayatollah Khomeini as written by Tom Clancy in the book? What was with the obvious cop-out of switching the black hat over to a cold-and-severe neo-Nazi straight out of a bad Ludlum book? Was it the reluctance to demonize an enemy to the point of perceived bigotry? I don't think anybody really needs me to remind them that 9/11/01 was symbolic of the fact that America doesn't exactly have a monopoly on hatred in plural. Of the fact that more people than us Yanks are capable of saying ""they're all alike and should be exterminated"" about some targeted group. As a Clancy fan, I'm always having to defend him against accusations of jingoism and chauvinism--how could he have lent his name to this? So my rating is a split ticket. 5 for filmcraft. 2 for the wuss-out this film represents as compared to its print counterpart. And zero for format--why did they only make a widescreen version when just about everything else is offered in fullscreen? There are a lot of us who can only afford a 27"" Magnavox.

I understand that the length of many of Clancy's novels make it very difficult to remain faithful to the books when trying to make a two hour movie, but I feel that because of the changes involved in making this movie, a lot of things were lost.  For example, by changing the terrorists from Muslim extremists to neo-Nazis, we lose the heated exchange between Ryan and President Fowler over the President's desire to nuke an Iranian city which is the home of the financial backer of the terror attack.  Fowler wishes to strike in response to the attack which has taken personally as an attempt on his own life, while Ryan disapproves, citing that other measures can be used to deal with this man rather than nuking a city and killing innocent people.  Also lost is Fowler's National Security Advisor, Elizabeth Elliot (not even in the movie), who seeks to discredit Ryan and attempts to destroy both his professional and personal lives.  Also missing is Ryan's plan to bring peace to the Middle East.  Actually, if there's a reason to buy or rent the DVD, it would be the commentary track with Robinson and Clancy, in which Clancy picks the entire film apart.  It is actually quite hilarious!

The producers have to be hating life post-911 since in my opinion at least this greatly detracted from the relevance of the film.  Serves them right for listening to Political Correctness rather than reality.The movie is based, of course, on Tom Clancy's novel ""The Sum of All Fears"" and deals with the detonation by terrorists of an atomic bomb on American soil. To that extent, the movie follows the novel.  But the movie alters the villains ..., and apparently decided to cast the hero, Jack Ryan, as a much younger man evidently to enable Ben Affleck to play the part.  Afleck is OK as Jack Ryan, but only OK.  Morgan Freeman does his customary great job in the role as the CIA director, and his mentoring of Ryan is my favorite part of the movie. The chemistry between Freeman and Affleck is good, which helps to make up for, well, Affleck. The rest of the cast turns in pretty decent performances.Since in the movie Ryan is a junior analyst rather than Deputy CIA Director (to enable Affleck to play Ryan) the part where Ryan prevents world war 3 is less plausible.  Readers of the book will know what I mean--spoiler omitted here.Overall, the movie moves along pretty well, and tells a complicated story about as coherently as possible in the movie medium.

596883,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JL8F,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 0]","**1/2 ""The Sum of All Fears"" raises the question of just how appropriate it is to use a subject like global nuclear warfare as window dressing for what is, essentially, a pretty run-of-the-mill action/adventure melodrama.  No subject matter is, of course, off limits when it comes to filmmaking - and that includes nuclear annihilation - but one can at least demand that the context and the treatment it receives be commensurate with the gravity of that subject.  (One need only look back to 1983's ""Testament"" to see how this can indeed be done successfully).Even putting aside the questionable nature of the material, ""The Sum of All Fears"" turns out to be a pretty weak action film overall, surprisingly lacking in tension and suspense despite the high stakes nature of its premise.  It's November 2002, and some higher-ups in the American government have discovered that a rogue nuclear missile is out there somewhere, most likely developed and planted by the quickly de-stabilizing Russian government.  Or was it?  Jack Ryan, that erstwhile hero of many of John Clancy's most popular novels, is the lone holdout who firmly believes that the bomb is NOT the work of the Russians but rather of some splinter terrorist group bent on setting off the device for their own nefarious purposes.Ask not how Jack Ryan, in his current incarnation in the form of young Ben Affleck, has managed to shave a few decades off his age (we should all learn that secret).  What is amazing is that he seems to have regressed in stature as well.  In fact, for most of the film, Ryan seems like a wide-eyed schoolboy, completely incapable of holding his own with all the heavyweights in which he comes into contact.  Affleck, who managed to do some actual acting in the recent ""Changing Lanes,"" is here reduced to a mere cipher, registering little more than openmouthed insipidity and rendering dull, emotionless line readings in the face of some pretty bland dialogue.  Despite the fact that he somehow manages to save the world (I thought Chris Rock did that just a few weeks ago in ""Bad Company""), Ryan never establishes a core of gravitas that might make his character even slightly believable.  He is, in short, a mere bantamweight hero.The first half of the film suffers greatly from the plodding direction of Phil Alden Robinson, whose style consists in having characters sit around in dark rooms talking to one another.  This is a particularly deadly technique when done in a wide screen format, since the effect of all those overblown close-ups coming one after another is to render the film strangely lumbering and static.  Things pick up a bit in the second half, but the filmmakers are forced to level an entire American city to accomplish it.  And even here, the pivotal scene in the film feels oddly truncated and aborted (one suspects that this depiction of urban destruction might have originally been longer and more elaborate but that sensitivity to the fears and emotions generated by the real life events of the past year may have encouraged the filmmakers to downplay it.  I know the trailer appeared more graphic).When all is said and done, there just doesn't seem to be all that much urgency to anything that happens in ""The Sum of All Fears,"" which is ludicrous considering the subject matter with which it is dealing.  This tone is particularly egregious in the final scene, a devil-may-care, happy-go-lucky conclusion that reminds us that Hollywood is never at a loss to find ways of demeaning even the most grave and sensitive of material.  In ""The Sum of All Fears,"" even the possibility of the end of the world through mutually assured self-destruction turns out to be a yawner.",2,Can One Man Save the World - Again?,1024790400,"06 23, 2002",2002,3689,"['**1/2', 'Sum', 'All', 'Fears', 'question', 'just', 'how', 'appropriate', 'use', 'subject', 'global', 'nuclear', 'warfare', 'window', 'dressing', 'what', 'essentially', 'pretty', 'run-of-the-mill', 'action/adventure', 'melodrama', 'subject', 'matter', 'course', 'off', 'when', 'filmmaking', 'nuclear', 'annihilation', 'one', 'can', 'least', 'demand', 'context', 'treatment', 'be', 'commensurate', 'gravity', 'subject', 'One', 'need', 'only', 'look', 'back', '1983', 'Testament', 'see', 'how', 'can', 'indeed', 'be', 'done', 'successfully', '.Even', 'putting', 'aside', 'questionable', 'nature', 'material', 'Sum', 'All', 'Fears', 'out', 'be', 'pretty', 'weak', 'action', 'film', 'overall', 'surprisingly', 'lacking', 'tension', 'suspense', 'high', 'stakes', 'nature', 'premise', 'November', '2002', 'higher-ups', 'American', 'government', 'have', 'discovered', 'rogue', 'nuclear', 'missile', 'out', 'there', 'somewhere', 'most', 'likely', 'developed', 'planted', 'quickly', 'de-stabilizing', 'Russian', 'government', 'was', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'erstwhile', 'hero', 'many', 'John', 'Clancy', 'most', 'popular', 'novels', 'lone', 'holdout', 'who', 'bomb', 'NOT', 'work', 'Russians', 'rather', 'splinter', 'terrorist', 'group', 'bent', 'setting', 'off', 'device', 'own', 'nefarious', 'purposes.Ask', 'not', 'how', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'current', 'incarnation', 'form', 'young', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'managed', 'shave', 'few', 'decades', 'age', 'should', 'learn', 'secret', 'What', 'amazing', 'have', 'regressed', 'stature', 'as', 'well', 'fact', 'most', 'film', 'Ryan', 'wide-eyed', 'schoolboy', 'completely', 'incapable', 'holding', 'own', 'heavyweights', 'contact', 'Affleck', 'who', 'managed', 'do', 'actual', 'acting', 'recent', 'Changing', 'Lanes', 'here', 'reduced', 'mere', 'cipher', 'registering', 'little', 'more', 'openmouthed', 'insipidity', 'rendering', 'dull', 'emotionless', 'line', 'readings', 'face', 'pretty', 'bland', 'dialogue', 'fact', 'somehow', 'save', 'world', 'thought', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'did', 'just', 'few', 'weeks', 'ago', 'Bad', 'Company', 'Ryan', 'never', 'core', 'gravitas', 'might', 'make', 'character', 'even', 'slightly', 'believable', 'short', 'mere', 'bantamweight', 'hero.The', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'suffers', 'greatly', 'plodding', 'direction', 'Phil', 'Alden', 'Robinson', 'style', 'having', 'characters', 'sit', 'dark', 'rooms', 'talking', 'one', 'particularly', 'deadly', 'technique', 'when', 'done', 'wide', 'screen', 'format', 'effect', 'overblown', 'close-ups', 'coming', 'one', 'render', 'film', 'strangely', 'lumbering', 'static', 'Things', 'pick', 'up', 'bit', 'second', 'half', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'forced', 'level', 'entire', 'American', 'city', 'accomplish', 'even', 'here', 'pivotal', 'scene', 'film', 'feels', 'oddly', 'truncated', 'aborted', 'one', 'depiction', 'urban', 'destruction', 'might', 'have', 'originally', 'been', 'longer', 'more', 'elaborate', 'sensitivity', 'fears', 'emotions', 'generated', 'real', 'life', 'events', 'past', 'year', 'may', 'have', 'encouraged', 'filmmakers', 'downplay', 'know', 'trailer', 'appeared', 'more', 'graphic', '.When', 'said', 'done', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'much', 'urgency', 'anything', 'Sum', 'All', 'Fears', 'ludicrous', 'considering', 'subject', 'matter', 'dealing', 'tone', 'particularly', 'egregious', 'final', 'scene', 'devil-may-care', 'happy-go-lucky', 'conclusion', 'Hollywood', 'never', 'loss', 'find', 'ways', 'demeaning', 'even', 'most', 'grave', 'sensitive', 'material', 'Sum', 'All', 'Fears', 'even', 'possibility', 'end', 'world', 'mutually', 'assured', 'self-destruction', 'out', 'be', 'yawner']",N/A

This is perhaps the worst of The Jack Ryan movies but it is still enjoyable. One scene in paticular that was just incredible was a bomb going off inside of a football stadium during what one would assume to be the Super Bowl but because of doubts from the NFL about using the Super Bowl and real NFL teams in a setting where a bomb would explode the producers had to invent fictitious teams and refer to the football game as simply 'The Big Game'. Those wary of movies containing this sort of subject matter after 9/11 would be wise to avoid 'The Sum Of All Fears' which is full of terrorist plots and scenarios.The last Jack Ryan film we had was 'Clear And Present Danger', a film that had it's share of complications but at least we got the Jack Ryan we all know and love, Harrison Ford.Ben Affleck now fills his shoes but he might as well be a whole new character, he doesn't give off the same energy and intelligence that Harrison Ford did and he lacks the older actor's seeming maturity for the role made famous in Tom Clancy novels.Don't get me wrong, Harrison Ford was getting way to old to play a character that is supposed to be in his thirties.Ben Affleck should have more experience in the next Jack Ryan movie and he seems to be physically the exact mental image of Jack Ryan. The biggest problem with this fourth film is the fact in that the director changed the terrorists from Arabs to Neo-Nazis.Give me a break. No doubt for the reason that he didn't want Islam or Arabs to get any sort of a bad rap after 9/11.I guarantee you that had 9/11 not occurred the terrorists in this film would really have been Arabs.

That's not to say that they're not great movies.  THEY ARE.  However, like all of the previous Clancy films, you'll be a lot happier if you watch this one and forget about the novel. The novel was a great book, and this is a great movie, but the two are only loosely connected.  I thought the nuke scenes were horrific, and extremely realistic (You be the judge when one goes off in the US someday).  There were a lot of ""modifications"" to the plot with political correctness in mind.  Ironically, 091101 happened, and that PC flavor collapsed with the towers.  Instead of muslim extremists (as in the book), the bad guys are neo-nazis (it's always been ok to see NAZIs as bad guys, so it was a safe modification).  Of course, had they kept true to the book, this movie might have been too realistic and provocative to release.  As it is, the US is under a constant state of terror alert (in real-life), and in this movie today's War on Terror and the possible war with Iraq are very similar to today's realities.  I suggest going to see this movie.  It's fun, entertaining, rewarding, and informative.  It'll help you realize and get a feel for the world in which we now live.  BUT DO NOT GO EXPECTING TO SEE THE BOOK.  Oh yeah....how was Ben Affleck?  Well, he's good, but he's not the Jack Ryan people remember from the book.

I have read every book, seen every movie, and I will willingly admit that I have often been a bit soft when reviewing Tom Clancy's work because I genuinely like the guy's stories and what he has to say in them.  I actually LOVED this book, so when I saw that Clancy himself was the executive producer of the film I thought great, he'll make it true to form.  I was so wrong.Instead of angry militant middle-eastern fanatics discovering the means to construct a nuclear bomb (very scary and believable), he/they changed it to a secret international ""society"" of neo-Nazis (not very believable) constructing a bomb to start a nuclear war between the U.S. and Russia.  In the book, the motives of the bad guys were clear.  In the movie we barely are aware of who the bad guys really are.  In the book, the bad guys own stupidity leads to a nuclear device which doesn't properly function, in the movie we see a full-blown, successful nuclear detonation.  And speaking of said detonation, anybody over the age of 25 who remembers the cold war can only wonder why the movie never mentions radiation fallout from a bomb that detonated in a packed football stadium less than an hour from Washington D.C.  The closing scene shows Ben Affleck's character lounging on the grass within sight of the White House, presumably only a short time after the nuclear explosion!?!?Speaking of Ben Affleck, I really like the guy and most of the roles he has played but he is monumentally unconvincing as Jack Ryan.  He doesn't come across as a guy with a PhD, he doesn't come across as a former Marine Officer, he doesn't come across as a man who is growing comfortably rich from his years working the stock market prior to joining the CIA.  In fact, they should have cast a man 10 years older than Affleck for this role, but I guess they figured it was worth changing the story and characters just to get a sure-sell name into the film.  How disgusting...I remember thinking when I read The Sum of All Fears that it was a monstrously long book, but all those pages were necessary to tell the story properly.  This film suffers from the usual Hollywood dilemma: make it good, or make it short enough to hold the short attention span of most viewers.  Unfortunately, they made the ill-fated choice to cut out crucial parts of the story, which eventually leaves those who had read the book disgusted and those who never read the book simply confused by the resulting disjointed, sloppy plotline.Don't buy this film and don't waste your time watching this film.",1,This film was an immense disappointment!,1064534400,"09 26, 2003",2003,2765,"['am', 'couch', 'DVD', 'loaded', 'snacks', 'are', 'reach', 'opening', 'credits', 'are', 'playing', 'then', 'one', 'worst', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'spins', 'out', 'have', 'been', 'Clancy', 'fan', 'beginning', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'seen', 'movie', 'will', 'willingly', 'have', 'often', 'been', 'bit', 'soft', 'when', 'reviewing', 'Tom', 'Clancy', 'work', 'genuinely', 'guy', 'stories', 'what', 'say', 'actually', 'LOVED', 'book', 'when', 'saw', 'Clancy', 'was', 'executive', 'producer', 'film', 'thought', 'great', ""'ll"", 'make', 'true', 'form', 'was', 'so', 'wrong.Instead', 'angry', 'militant', 'middle-eastern', 'fanatics', 'discovering', 'means', 'construct', 'nuclear', 'bomb', 'very', 'scary', 'believable', 'he/they', 'changed', 'secret', 'international', 'society', 'neo-Nazis', 'not', 'very', 'believable', 'constructing', 'bomb', 'start', 'nuclear', 'war', 'U.S.', 'Russia', 'book', 'motives', 'bad', 'guys', 'were', 'clear', 'movie', 'barely', 'are', 'aware', 'who', 'bad', 'guys', 'really', 'are', 'book', 'bad', 'guys', 'own', 'stupidity', 'nuclear', 'device', ""n't"", 'properly', 'function', 'movie', 'see', 'full-blown', 'successful', 'nuclear', 'detonation', 'speaking', 'said', 'detonation', 'anybody', 'age', '25', 'who', 'cold', 'war', 'can', 'only', 'wonder', 'why', 'movie', 'never', 'mentions', 'radiation', 'fallout', 'bomb', 'detonated', 'packed', 'football', 'stadium', 'less', 'hour', 'Washington', 'D.C', 'closing', 'scene', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'character', 'lounging', 'grass', 'sight', 'White', 'House', 'presumably', 'only', 'short', 'time', 'nuclear', 'explosion', 'Speaking', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'really', 'guy', 'most', 'roles', 'played', 'monumentally', 'unconvincing', 'Jack', 'Ryan', ""n't"", 'come', 'guy', 'PhD', ""n't"", 'come', 'former', 'Marine', 'Officer', ""n't"", 'come', 'man', 'who', 'growing', 'comfortably', 'rich', 'years', 'working', 'stock', 'market', 'prior', 'joining', 'CIA', 'fact', 'should', 'have', 'cast', 'man', '10', 'years', 'older', 'Affleck', 'role', 'guess', 'figured', 'was', 'worth', 'changing', 'story', 'characters', 'just', 'get', 'sure-sell', 'name', 'film', 'How', 'disgusting', 'remember', 'thinking', 'when', 'read', 'Sum', 'All', 'Fears', 'was', 'monstrously', 'long', 'book', 'pages', 'were', 'necessary', 'tell', 'story', 'properly', 'film', 'suffers', 'usual', 'Hollywood', 'dilemma', 'make', 'good', 'make', 'short', 'enough', 'hold', 'short', 'attention', 'span', 'most', 'viewers', 'Unfortunately', 'made', 'ill-fated', 'choice', 'cut', 'out', 'crucial', 'parts', 'story', 'eventually', 'who', 'had', 'read', 'book', 'disgusted', 'who', 'never', 'read', 'book', 'simply', 'confused', 'resulting', 'disjointed', 'sloppy', 'plotline.Do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'watching', 'film']",N/A

596900,A2G606VQGJ5EN9,B00005JL8F,Sodalug,"[1, 6]","Harrison Ford played the part of Jack Ryan as best he could, considering Tom Clancy wrote the character as a young CIA analyst. Various sources report that Clancy was particularly unhappy about Ford's casting as Ryan, and is presumably much happier with Affleck now playing the role. Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger were both fine films, but Sum of All Fears easily surpasses them. The younger Ben Affleck playing Ryan is one factor, but not the only one. Simply stated, Sum of All Fears is a much tighter and more action packed thriller than its predecessors.The plot goes like this: an Israeli bomber carrying a nuclear bomb is shot down in the desert and quickly buried by the shifting sands. Many years later the bomb is dug up by locals who sell such relics as scrap, not knowing the deadly nature of their find. The bomb is purchased by a group of Nazis who intend to make it into a working bomb and secretly ship it to the US. Their plan is simple, detonate the bomb in the US and frame the Russians, causing an all out nuclear war between the two superpowers. Ryan is a brash, young CIA Info Analyst trying to prove the diabolical plot and prevent world war.The film does a fine job of presenting all this with a very realistic feel. The events that unfold leading up to the clash are logical and not at all contrived. In light of America's newfound awareness of such terrorist activities, convincing the audience that this is possible is considerably easier for the filmmakers. The choice of Nazis as the bad guys is an obvious, and understandable compromise. It would be far more realistic to make the terrorists middle eastern, but would likely cause such a ruckus with many audiences it just wouldn't be worth the trouble. Filmmakers are faced with a much smaller pool of potential bad guys these days, as every ethnicity attempts to make itself a protected class in society.Strong performances are turned in by all involved. Although Ryan's girlfriend is a wholly unnecessary character, but obviously thrown in to give Affleck a love interest where none is needed.The only thing keeping the film from achieving true greatness is the contrived nature of Ryan's character. From the viewpoint of the studio and the general viewing public, it is a necessity to have a primary hero protagonist whom the action of the story revolves around. In reality, Ryan's character would have been played by many different individuals. But that would present the challenge to the audience to track the development of multiple characters, in the end it's just easier to lump them all into one.I feel it is worth noting the excellent use of visual effects in the film. Lucas and Spielberg take note - the stunts and CGI effects were used sparingly and only when absolutely necessary to advance the plot. In particular I felt the overhead, satellite view shots of the cities that preceded many of the scenes were especially effective. Aside from serving as an excellent transition between scenes and geographic locales, they reinforced a central them of the film: that the advance of technology has effectively shrunk the size of the world we live in. Also, they give the audience a sense of the perspective that an intelligence organization like the CIA must take when approaching the world. Unlike the individual members of the audience who see things from a limited ground level perspective, the CIA has to step back and see the big picture.",3,Finally a more realistic Jack Ryan,1101859200,"12 1, 2004",2004,3447,"['Harrison', 'Ford', 'played', 'part', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'best', 'could', 'considering', 'Tom', 'Clancy', 'wrote', 'character', 'young', 'CIA', 'analyst', 'Various', 'sources', 'report', 'Clancy', 'was', 'particularly', 'unhappy', 'Ford', 'casting', 'Ryan', 'presumably', 'much', 'happier', 'Affleck', 'now', 'playing', 'role', 'Patriot', 'Games', 'Clear', 'Present', 'Danger', 'were', 'fine', 'films', 'Sum', 'All', 'Fears', 'easily', 'younger', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'playing', 'Ryan', 'one', 'factor', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'Simply', 'stated', 'Sum', 'All', 'Fears', 'much', 'tighter', 'more', 'action', 'packed', 'thriller', 'predecessors.The', 'plot', 'Israeli', 'bomber', 'carrying', 'nuclear', 'bomb', 'shot', 'down', 'desert', 'quickly', 'buried', 'shifting', 'sands', 'Many', 'years', 'later', 'bomb', 'dug', 'up', 'locals', 'who', 'sell', 'such', 'relics', 'scrap', 'not', 'knowing', 'deadly', 'nature', 'find', 'bomb', 'purchased', 'group', 'Nazis', 'who', 'intend', 'make', 'working', 'bomb', 'secretly', 'ship', 'US', 'plan', 'simple', 'detonate', 'bomb', 'US', 'frame', 'Russians', 'causing', 'out', 'nuclear', 'war', 'two', 'superpowers', 'Ryan', 'brash', 'young', 'CIA', 'Info', 'Analyst', 'trying', 'prove', 'diabolical', 'plot', 'prevent', 'world', 'war.The', 'film', 'fine', 'job', 'presenting', 'very', 'realistic', 'feel', 'events', 'unfold', 'leading', 'up', 'clash', 'are', 'logical', 'not', 'contrived', 'light', 'America', 'newfound', 'awareness', 'such', 'terrorist', 'activities', 'convincing', 'audience', 'possible', 'considerably', 'easier', 'filmmakers', 'choice', 'Nazis', 'bad', 'guys', 'obvious', 'understandable', 'compromise', 'would', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'realistic', 'make', 'terrorists', 'middle', 'eastern', 'would', 'likely', 'cause', 'such', 'ruckus', 'many', 'audiences', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'trouble', 'Filmmakers', 'are', 'faced', 'much', 'smaller', 'pool', 'potential', 'bad', 'guys', 'days', 'ethnicity', 'make', 'protected', 'class', 'society.Strong', 'performances', 'are', 'turned', 'involved', 'Ryan', 'girlfriend', 'wholly', 'unnecessary', 'character', 'obviously', 'thrown', 'give', 'Affleck', 'love', 'interest', 'where', 'none', 'needed.The', 'only', 'thing', 'keeping', 'film', 'achieving', 'true', 'greatness', 'contrived', 'nature', 'Ryan', 'character', 'viewpoint', 'studio', 'general', 'viewing', 'public', 'necessity', 'have', 'primary', 'hero', 'protagonist', 'whom', 'action', 'story', 'around', 'reality', 'Ryan', 'character', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'many', 'different', 'individuals', 'would', 'present', 'challenge', 'audience', 'track', 'development', 'multiple', 'characters', 'end', 'just', 'easier', 'lump', 'one.I', 'feel', 'worth', 'noting', 'excellent', 'use', 'visual', 'effects', 'film', 'Lucas', 'Spielberg', 'take', 'note', 'stunts', 'CGI', 'effects', 'were', 'used', 'sparingly', 'only', 'when', 'absolutely', 'necessary', 'advance', 'plot', 'particular', 'felt', 'overhead', 'satellite', 'view', 'shots', 'cities', 'preceded', 'many', 'scenes', 'were', 'especially', 'effective', 'Aside', 'serving', 'excellent', 'transition', 'scenes', 'geographic', 'locales', 'reinforced', 'central', 'film', 'advance', 'technology', 'effectively', 'shrunk', 'size', 'world', 'live', 'Also', 'give', 'audience', 'sense', 'perspective', 'intelligence', 'organization', 'CIA', 'must', 'take', 'when', 'approaching', 'world', 'individual', 'members', 'audience', 'who', 'see', 'things', 'limited', 'ground', 'level', 'perspective', 'CIA', 'step', 'back', 'see', 'big', 'picture']",N/A
596901,AATKF0HDBQL86,B00005JL8F,"S. Smith ""ltcolkiranerys""","[1, 4]","I've long been a fan of Tom Clancy's novels, and when The Sum of All Fears came out as a movie, I had to go see it because I hadn't seen a Jack Ryan film in a long time (I'd watched The Hunt for Red October once in the theater and numerous times on video, but Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger were just plain boring).  Let me tell you, from the first minute I was HOOKED!  The Sum of All Fears had everything that the last two movies lacked--a good potboiler of a plot, lots of action, and an awesome new Jack Ryan in Ben Affleck, who made the character very believable and human.This movie had a great cast of supporting actors as well.  I loved seeing Morgan Freeman as Bill Cabot, Ryan's boss at the CIA, and James Cromwell as the President.  Liev Schreiber as Clark was terrific--he has matured quite nicely as an actor since playing Cotton Weary in the Scream trilogy.  Bridget Moynahan did a nice job as Cathy Muller, Ryan's girlfriend, and it was nice to see actor Michael Byrne as Grushkov.One of the things that I really like about the DVD release of The Sum of All Fears is the fact that instead of releasing a &quot;bare bones&quot; version (in other words, no extras) like they usually do, Paramount went all out and included stuff that provides a fascinating look into the making of the film as well as the thoughts of those involved with it.  There are 2 tracks of commentaries--one with director Phil Alden Robinson and the cinematographer, and one with Robinson and Tom Clancy, as well as a 2-part making of documentary that goes into some of the reasons they decided to restart the franchise and cast a younger actor in the role of Jack Ryan (for those of you out there who didn't like Ben Affleck as Ryan, blame Sherry Lansing, CEO of Paramount's movie division--it was her idea to cast him) and a visual effects section with commentary on how they filmed some of the scenes.  There is also a theatrical trailer.  While the extras aren't as abundant as on other DVDs, this is a nice surprise from a studio that is normally loath to put extras on their DVDs at all because of the cost of including them (as a matter of fact, Paramount usually won't include extras unless the director insists on it).IMO, The Sum of All Fears is a great film, and a nice way to revitalize the Jack Ryan franchise.",5,"Way to go, Ben!!",1045785600,"02 21, 2003",2003,2322,"[""'ve"", 'long', 'been', 'fan', 'Tom', 'Clancy', 'novels', 'when', 'Sum', 'All', 'Fears', 'came', 'out', 'movie', 'had', 'go', 'see', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'film', 'long', 'time', ""'d"", 'watched', 'Hunt', 'Red', 'October', 'once', 'theater', 'numerous', 'times', 'video', 'Patriot', 'Games', 'Clear', 'Present', 'Danger', 'were', 'just', 'plain', 'boring', 'Let', 'tell', 'first', 'minute', 'was', 'HOOKED', 'Sum', 'All', 'Fears', 'had', 'everything', 'last', 'two', 'movies', 'lacked', 'good', 'potboiler', 'plot', 'lots', 'action', 'awesome', 'new', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'who', 'made', 'character', 'very', 'believable', 'human.This', 'movie', 'had', 'great', 'cast', 'supporting', 'actors', 'as', 'well', 'loved', 'seeing', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Bill', 'Cabot', 'Ryan', 'boss', 'CIA', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'President', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'Clark', 'was', 'terrific', 'matured', 'quite', 'nicely', 'actor', 'playing', 'Cotton', 'Weary', 'Scream', 'trilogy', 'Bridget', 'Moynahan', 'did', 'nice', 'job', 'Cathy', 'Muller', 'Ryan', 'girlfriend', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'actor', 'Michael', 'Byrne', 'Grushkov.One', 'things', 'really', 'DVD', 'release', 'Sum', 'All', 'Fears', 'fact', 'instead', 'releasing', 'quot', 'bare', 'bones', 'quot', 'version', 'other', 'words', 'extras', 'usually', 'do', 'Paramount', 'went', 'included', 'stuff', 'fascinating', 'look', 'making', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'thoughts', 'involved', 'are', '2', 'tracks', 'commentaries', 'one', 'director', 'Phil', 'Alden', 'Robinson', 'cinematographer', 'one', 'Robinson', 'Tom', 'Clancy', 'as', 'well', '2-part', 'making', 'documentary', 'reasons', 'decided', 'restart', 'franchise', 'cast', 'younger', 'actor', 'role', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Ryan', 'blame', 'Sherry', 'Lansing', 'CEO', 'Paramount', 'movie', 'division', 'was', 'idea', 'cast', 'visual', 'effects', 'section', 'commentary', 'how', 'filmed', 'scenes', 'also', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'extras', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'abundant', 'other', 'DVDs', 'nice', 'surprise', 'studio', 'normally', 'loath', 'put', 'extras', 'DVDs', 'cost', 'including', 'matter', 'fact', 'Paramount', 'usually', 'wo', ""n't"", 'include', 'extras', 'director', 'Sum', 'All', 'Fears', 'great', 'film', 'nice', 'way', 'revitalize', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'franchise']",N/A

Even though I believe this movie to be an exciting and suspenseful film, this is simply a review of the quality of the movie's transfer to Blu Ray.The video transfer is excellent in all areas with no artifacting or grain.  The color grading tends to be cool and there is a great depth to the shadows and darker areas throughout.  No stair-stepping that I could see which would have been prevalent in the wide angle shots of the stadium.  The transfer was very detailed and clean. 5 StarsThe audio is Dolby HD 5.1 and for the first 1/2 of the film the score is marked by fine separation of the instrumentation.  I did notice from the very beginning that the film's audio levels seemed lower than most Blu Rays I have and so I raised the audio gain by a few notches as some of the early dialogue just seemed too low for my tastes.  During this first half of the film there is really not much for the discreet channels or the sub to do.  However, the audio on this disc really shines once you get to the stadium scenes and thereafter with exceptional and discreetly channeled crowd noise and foley fx with fine panning between the audio channels when appropriate.  Audio  4.5The extras consisted of the usual commentaries but also an interesting 'making of ' feature and a 5 part ""How'd they create that special effect' documentary which I also found most interesting.The blu ray purchase paid off and was worth buying.  All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.Thanks",5,The Sum of All Fears on Blu Ray,1356480000,"12 26, 2012",2012,1831,"['plot', 'here', 'opinions', 'book', 'acting', 'Even', 'believe', 'movie', 'be', 'exciting', 'suspenseful', 'film', 'simply', 'review', 'quality', 'movie', 'transfer', 'Blu', 'Ray.The', 'video', 'transfer', 'excellent', 'areas', 'artifacting', 'grain', 'color', 'grading', 'tends', 'be', 'cool', 'great', 'depth', 'shadows', 'darker', 'areas', 'stair-stepping', 'could', 'see', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'prevalent', 'wide', 'angle', 'shots', 'stadium', 'transfer', 'was', 'very', 'detailed', 'clean', '5', 'StarsThe', 'audio', 'Dolby', 'HD', '5.1', 'first', '1/2', 'film', 'score', 'marked', 'fine', 'separation', 'instrumentation', 'did', 'notice', 'very', 'beginning', 'film', 'audio', 'levels', 'seemed', 'lower', 'most', 'Blu', 'Rays', 'have', 'so', 'raised', 'audio', 'gain', 'few', 'notches', 'early', 'dialogue', 'just', 'seemed', 'too', 'low', 'tastes', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'really', 'not', 'much', 'discreet', 'channels', 'sub', 'do', 'However', 'audio', 'disc', 'really', 'once', 'get', 'stadium', 'scenes', 'thereafter', 'exceptional', 'discreetly', 'channeled', 'crowd', 'noise', 'foley', 'fx', 'fine', 'panning', 'audio', 'channels', 'when', 'appropriate', '4.5The', 'extras', 'consisted', 'usual', 'commentaries', 'also', 'interesting', ""'making"", 'feature', '5', 'part', 'How', ""'d"", 'create', 'special', 'effect', 'documentary', 'also', 'found', 'most', 'interesting.The', 'blu', 'ray', 'purchase', 'paid', 'off', 'was', 'worth', 'buying', 'movie', 'reviews', 'are', 'nature', 'focus', 'only', 'quality', 'transfer', 'BluRay', 'so', 'check', 'see', 'are', 'help', 'well.Hopefully', 'review', 'been', 'help', 'determining', 'purchase', 'hope', 'am', 'correct', 'path', 'review', 'transfer', 'quality', 'opposed', 'providing', 'plot', 'summaries.Thanks']",N/A

Amid all the concern over whether Affleck could effectively replace Ford and renew this tiring franchise, the producers seem to have forgotten that the best pick-me-up would have been a decent screenplay. This one's awful. We know from the outset precisely where it's heading, and when it gets there - after an interminable hour of tedious preamble - it's a virtual non-event: the nuclear explosion which flattens Baltimore is realized with about as much visual flair as a White House press conference. Worse, the events it initiates rapidly mushroom into ludicrousness thanks to ham-fisted, telemovie plotting. Interest is quickly lost. The direction is patchy, Goldsmith's music is typically dire, and the performances are lukewarm at best. Apart from the nicely put together denouement montage, it's pretty standard fare.  And Affleck?  Sure, he's a nice kid, but there's no getting around it: brooding looks and boyish charm are no match for the paternal, patriotic gravitas of Ford.

Well, after adding bad acting, predictability, and a dull storyline, the sum is of all my bad movie fears. What is the problem with this movie? Well let's break it up into sections.First off is the story. Tom Clancy's story isn't bad. The movie adaptation is. It is basically just a boring suspense movie. The story had potential. But it sugar-coated the actual sum of all of our fears. What would have really happened had the Americans . . .? This subject is not touched on and therefore turns this possible anti-nuclear weapon movie into a boring, edge-of-your-seat as you slide off it and leave during the first five minutes movie.Let's now take a look at Jack Ryan. Harrison Ford was good, and he was getting a little too old for the part, but Ben Affleck is too childish of an actor to portray CIA analyst Jack Ryan. Clancy's gripe about Ford being too old was a little over the top though. Let's face it. Ben Affleck is a terrible actor. Which brings us into the next category...Acting. The acting is terrible. It is corny, contrived, and most of all, TERRIBLE! Michael Byrne was the only actor besides Morgan Freeman to display some acting skills. Line delivery is terrible. Interestingly though, this movie is about neo-fascist Nazis. Well, Byrne played a Nazi in Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade.Predictability. This movie is so terribly predictable. If someone said ""no new ideas"", well they hit the nail right on the head. Let's look at the beginning . . .. The picture in the cockpit? A tell-tale sign that this pilot will be killed. And of course the extremely predictable "". . ."" appears, trying to wrench our hearts out. Can someone tell me why it didn't get incinerated? The . . . is sad, but it is marred by things like contrived emotions. ""You can lead a horse to water, but you cannot make it drink."" And finally we get to the end. Who would have guessed that the Americans would . . .? I did.Camerawork. The camera very rarely sits still. Either it is bouncing around as it follows someone or it is bouncing around while it is attached to a jeep. Whatever happened to smooth pans and the ability to follow someone without bouncing the camera around?Well, that about sums it up. Let's face it. Movie ideas are running low. It seems all we have left are sequels and adaptations of books.

It is terrifying to think of how many Generals actually want war and try to push (both) Presidents towards conflict.The main ""event"" was bad enough, but to me, when the Russian bombers fired on our aircraft carrier, I just gasped. This is war. Right here, right now, THIS is the end. Russian military hardware firing at American hardware? That's the END, people. Right here, right now. Today. Did you want to live past today? Too bad! Final stop, everyone gets off.The story is complex and well written. There are a dozen things happening at once and everyone is great at their part.

That means that Clancy maybe had a lot to do with this film, right?Here's the story:  The Israelies, almost unimaginably, fumble an Atomic bomb.  Oy vey! Thirty years later, the bomb is dug up by a bunch of camel-driving hicks from Cabbageville, Egypt and sold to an unscrupulous arms dealer.  Then, somebody uses it to blow up the city of Baltimore and start World War III.Who plans and executes this dirty deed?  Why none other than our old arch-enemies, the Nazis, of course!  Full steam ahead, Mr. Gridley! Dam up the river, and head for the hills!As this highly suspenseful drama unfolds in a series of cartoon-like situations, we see Ben Affleck hamming it up and mugging his way through the film, at a cocktail party in the United States, at a Russian atomic weapons lab, then to Africa, then to Langley, then to Washington, then to Baltimore, then to Washington, then to...  Which leads me to the obvious question, Who was the target audience for this film?Phony CIA operatives?  Naval Reservist Impersonators?  Fidel Castro? A two-bit despot living in exile somewhere?One group of people who will really get excited about this movie are your good old rabid Cleveland Browns fans - because most of them will probably get off on the idea that the evil Art Modell and the Ravens could be vaporized into a cloud of red dust.

The failure does not necessarily come from any huge blooper but a combination of lots of little weaknesses.This is a film based on a book by Tom Clancy. Clancy is a writer who likes to fill his novels with lots of technical details. The details often give the impression to his less educated readers that they are somehow learning something about the real world. The way his books are constructed is that the plot is usually rudimentary and the appeal is the sense of realism and the level of detail.This film is about a group who, try to start a war between what were once the superpowers by attempting to detonate a nuclear weapon in America and then blame it on the Russians. Jack Ryan Clancy's hero of most of his books is the key to whether the war is prevented or not. Alec Baldwin and Harrison Ford have played Ryan in previous films. Here he is played by a youthful Ben Afleck. Afleck is clearly to young a person for the role. No one that young and low on the totem pole would be able to get the sort of access he does to important figures that he does in the movie. He is also in love with a 20 something model who is meant to be a surgeon. Again something which is simply improbable.The move although having the veneer of technical knowledge is in reality set in fantasy land. If Israel lost a nuclear bomb in the Golan Heights  in 1973 they would hardly leave it there. It is the sort of thing which would lead to a major military effort to prevent it falling into the hands of the Syrians.

Those familiar with the books know that Jack Ryan is older, in his late 30s or early 40s. He is also married, is a veteran Marine, and possesses a doctorate in history. Affleck's Ryan is a 20 something, who seems to be more of an intern than an expert in Soviet and Russian history/politics. Certainly, his Russian is just plain awful.Worse still, the storyline is totally unconvincing. We are supposed to believe a group of Neo-Nazis stand to benefit by starting a war between the U.S. and Soviet Union... oops, Russia. Just how they will profit from this war is never really explained, but since Nazis are politically correct villains (the book originally had Muslim extremists), so be it.Later, we are expected to believe that a mysterious nuclear explosion in Baltimore will compel the president into a rush to judgment, by launching a nuclear strike against the Soviet Union... oops, Russia. This storyline may have worked twenty years ago, but seems totally obsolete today. If you want to watch an accelerating, accidental nuclear war between the U.S. and Sovie... oops, Russia, you are better off getting Fail Safe, Countdown to Looking Glass, or even Dr. Strangelove.In the end, when Jack Ryan single handedly saves the world by chancing on an open communications line that happens to go directly to the Sovie... oops, Russian President, we all breath a collective sigh of relief. Unfortunately, those who would shed light on who actually nuked Baltimore end up being covertly shot, blown up, or have their throats cut.

Then when they were over and I made my way out of the theatre, all of their bad points started piling up until I got disgusted with them and decided the movies actually sucked.  Ali was the first.  This was the second.At least Ali had a good performance by Will Smith.  This one had--uh, well, nothing redeeming.  Ben Afflect seemed to be running around clueless or frantic the whole movie.  Morgan Freeman was sufficient as the typical CIA honcho.  No big acting stretch there.The spineless studio drones decided to make the Neo-Nazis, rather than Islamic fanatics, the driving force in attempting to start a world war.  Puh-lease.  Well... hey, maybe they're right... perhaps Islamic fanatics would never do anything terroristic.  And that's just one problem with the story alone.It seemed like they were trying to make the movie look big-budget while at the same time they didn't want to spend any money on it.  The nuclear blast was seen only through a distant mushroom cloud, the hospital windows getting blown in, and the helicopters knocked around in the sky.  And even those special effects were brief.  If you saw the tv commercial for the movie, you saw all of the special effects.  Hello???  What a wasted opportunity.  And after that, one of the most ridiculous scenes was Ben Affleck in an urban area at night with flames (supposedly the result of a nuclear blast) lapping at him while he's running to the dramatic music.  And how convenient that he could RUN to his destination, in a city that had been devastated by a nuclear blast, in time to save the world.Then you have the typical directoral mistakes that I instantly notice and take me right out of the movie.  For instance when someone cuts a hole out of a fence and sets it on the ground next to them.  Then they crawl through the hole in the fence to the other side.  And suddenly the section of fence that they removed is now on their side of the fence, as though they pushed it through initially.  That kind of junk in movies annoys me.There were so many improbabilities and absurdities that I don't want to go into them all.  It's just stupid stuff that should not happen in a movie like this.  Taken individually they can be shrugged off, but cumulatively they destroy the movie and the experience.Again, I'm at a loss at how many reviewers liked (or even loved) this movie.

596927,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JL8F,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 8]","When I heard that Ben Affleck takes over Jack Ryan role, I sais, like -- ""Ben Affleck as Jack Ryan????""  Later I saw this film and I know, you see, Harrison Ford definitely didn't want this script.  It's tired, clithed, 'unworkable' -- the last word being from his interview.  Though I personally don't like him very much, I admit Ford is clever to bail out of the Jack Ryan series.  Yes, even though his anticipated ""K-19"" turned out a commercial failure.That doesn't mean Ben Affleck is awful.  His is different Jack, so I get over it while watching it.  Though he was much. much, much better in the little-seen (but infinitely superiror) film called ""Chasing Amy,"" Ben is OK.  Just OK, but no complaint.  His love story with Bridget Moynahan is tedious (as is his with lovely Liv in ""Armageddon""), but let's talk about something else.  What is really, stinking awful is the story.Jack Ryan, a CIA analyst, after his rather hasty, hot-shot behavior at the high-level military meeting at the US government, is given a job to follow the trace of three missing Russian nuclear scientists.  At the same time, a nuclear bomb that was hidden in the ground of the Golan Heights, falls into the wrong hand.  Those two incidents gradually lead to the catastorophe that happens in Super-Bowl Game in Baltimore.The first half of the film goes steadily, in the fashion of John LeCaree novels.  Without showy explosions or gun-shots, the film maintains its suspence until the event that everyone probably has already known.  The film, until then an OK film, suddenly turns into a sheer nonsense -- actually, the film is from the beginning based on purely imaginative power, not close observation on history (when you loses a A-bomb, you usually try to find it, as Cuba Gooding Jr. film ""Men of Honor"" tells you), but after the big explosion, everything go derailed.  It's so laughable.As many reviewers seem to have pointed out about the absurd use of computers or internet, let alone Jack Ryan's (who is still a  novice in CIA) amateur diplomatic skill over phone call, so let me add this only.  If you get into the city of Baltimore like he does, it is most certain that he is exposed to (lethal) amount of radioactivity, thus possibly culminating in his early death, or cancer.  Whoever knows something about the deadly accident in Russuan nuclear reactor that happened years ago, or much before, the US soldiers who witnessed the nuclear ground experiments in Nevada, will teach you precious things for Jack to know.  The way ""The Sum of All Fears"" treats nuclear weapons is a great insult to the victims and our intellect.I know (or hope) the Hollywood really knows the truth; perhaps, they changed the truth for the purpose of entertainment value of the film.  But there's a limit to anything, and there should be in Hollywood.  I tried to ignore this kind of ignorance they commit, for instance, in ""True Lies"" -- where Tom Arnold tells people, when a nuclear missle explodes out at the sea of Miami, to cover their eyes with hands and it's okay.  Doesn't he know something named radioactivity?  Awful ignorance.I tried to ignore these follies in Hollywood, but couldn't.  (In this sense, ""Indepenence Day"" was much less absurd in the description of nuclear weapons.)  And they did it again in ""The Sum of All Fears.""  The second half of the film is, even after forgetting that scene, full of incredible events and bad acting.  Morgan Freeman is good as ever, but his choice of roles is suspect these days; if you see his turn in ""Street Smart,"" you see he is wasting talent in this rubbish.  Ben is so-so, but it is James Cromwell who needs another lecture on his overacting as the US president, and Henry Fonda in ""Fail-Safe"" would teach him how to play this kind of character.The film ends in very unsatisfactory way, with bad guys punished (like in many other B-action flicks), and good guys smiling, vowing to live in peace, and Ben and Brigdet, talking about love on the sunny, green lawn, as if nothing happened in Baltimore.  This is unacceptable. even at the level of entertainment.  You say this is an entertainment, but are you really ""entertained"" with this?Arnie's ""Collateral Damage"" was severely attacked because of its story involving terrorism, but it at least knew what it was doing as entertainment, with its larger-than-life situation and big, loud actions.  ""The Sum of All Fears"" apparently takes a more serious pose, capitalizing on our growing fear of these days.  But what it offers is insensible, ridiculous Hollywood routine that reaches the offensiveness.

596932,A2A5J6GBT4EFJU,B00005JL8F,Victek,"[5, 6]","Tom Clancy's ""Sum Of All Fears"" is a 900 page thriller - complex, highly detailed and smart.  A mini-series would be necessary to preserve the integrity of the story, but alas it was squashed into two hours for the theater.  Large parts of the story were completely discarded and what remains has been compressed to the point of being barely recognizable.  What makes the book so interesting is the premise that the US and Russian governments could be manipulated by clever terrorists, and in spite of all safeguards the world could be brought to the brink of nuclear war.  The movie shows us the escalating danger, but without the insights.  Be afraid, be very afraid!While I can understand the problem of creating a coherent screenplay I cannot understand the characterization of Jack Ryan (played by Ben Affleck).  Jack Ryan (as portrayed by Tom Clancy) is not just a guy who runs with guns.  He is smart, thoughtful, and highly articulate.  He is the Deputy Director of the CIA and an advisor to the President!  Yet in this film he says things like ""I really don't believe the Russian leader would act that way, Sir.""  Apparently we are supposed to believe that Jack Ryan saves the day because he can walk away from helicopter crashes, and because he's really, really sincere.Still, on the plus side the film is nice to look at, moves at a fast pace, has a few well done special effects, and some decent acting (notably Morgan Freeman).

Decisions based on personal emotion and over-heated rhetoric - well, scratch just about any decision made in politics and you'll find a lot more of that than of hard data and logic. A mild-mannered historian drawn into military politics and CIA dirty tricks - it certainly appeals to anyone who's suddenly found themselves in way over their head.Throw in a cast with remarkable star power and tension that builds naturally from events, not synthesized from loud noises and flashing lights. It adds up to a bit of entertainment well above the usual.

I'd give it 1 to 2 stars for not following the book, hardly at all, and 4 1/2 for stand alone action and story.Very thoughtful and present day reality to terrorism hitting the U.S. Affleck plays a decent Jack Ryan, albeit, he and Cathy are married in the book with one kid already. Enjoyed the stressful military sequences between the U.S. and Russia, although the bombing of the carrier was far fetched. Even in normal peacetime, the carrier would have a CAP (Carrier Air Patrol) aloft to keep an eye on things. Noticed an AWACS recon plane on the deck. Normally, it is in the air, plus there are usually several other ships in the Carrier Battle Group.But I digress. Several other nuances, that bothered me, as I see it bothered others, was that it was set in 2002, with an unmarried Ryan. So, am I to believe that Patriot Games, Hunt for Red Oct, and Clear & Present Danger are set sometime in the future? 2005 or so?Also, a nuclear bomb going off in Baltimore would have killed more people due to fallout/radiation and heat, even though it was low yield. Also, the terrorists in the book were Islamic, not Neo-Nazi.So, my suggestion is to not read the book before you see the movie, and if you have, then don't think of it as a Clancy movie, just a stand alone military action thriller.",3,Good flick!

596940,A2KZLEDNVTF3J9,B00005JL8F,"""yeazel""","[8, 13]","This movie is ridiculous beyond description. First of all, it dramatically altered the plot of the book it is based on purely for the sake of political correctness, and came out with an absurd plot which is laughable to anyone with even a basic interest in geopolitics (Lets see, everyone hates nazis, make them try to take over the world and people will love it, right?). Hmmm, where to continue...NATO peacekeepers in Chechnya?!? Umm, THAT WOULD BE AN INVASION OF SOVREIGN RUSSIAN TERRITORY, AND AN ACT OF WAR!!!!The President's staff in the movie actually agrees that the Russians would ""call it a day"" if we launched a massive nuclear strike against Russia, crippling the Russian military, and undoubtedly killing millions of people, leaving them with only several hundred nuclear weapons. ARE YOU KIDDING ME??? They would hit back with everything they had!!!It is also absurd that the government would immediately assume that the Russian government would be behind what is obviously a terrorist act, and respond within a matter of hours.Worst and most unbelievably of all, Ben Affleck, supposedly a CIA agent with 14 months of experience, convinces both Russia and the U.S. to back down from a de facto state of war because of a ""hunch."" HA.Now just for some little points the die-hards like myself would notice:Hmmm, an American spy ordering two Ukrainian guards to voluntarily disarm themselves when they both could easily kill him?The idea that a U.S. Navy carrier battle group equipped with beyond cutting edge radar systems would not be able to pick up a flight of Backfire Bombers on full afterburner, but vintage-70's russian radar could pick up U.S. stealth bombers which are INVISIBLE TO RADAR!!!! (By the way, our B-2's would fly over the north pole, not over Poland.)Furthermore, I feel that this movie could [upset] some of the Russians who may happen to see it. This is something that I think should be considered at a time when the Russian President is bending over backwards to build a new reltaionship with America, and facing a considerable amount of criticism at home.The audience was literally laughing it was so bad in the showing I saw.So, to some it up:Political Correctness: BADAwful plot: BAD=BAD MOVIE!!!!",1,Laughable,1023148800,"06 4, 2002",2002,2235,"['movie', 'ridiculous', 'description', 'First', 'all', 'dramatically', 'altered', 'plot', 'book', 'based', 'purely', 'sake', 'political', 'correctness', 'came', 'out', 'absurd', 'plot', 'laughable', 'anyone', 'even', 'basic', 'interest', 'geopolitics', 'Lets', 'see', 'everyone', 'hates', 'nazis', 'make', 'try', 'take', 'over', 'world', 'people', 'will', 'love', 'right', 'Hmmm', 'where', 'continue', 'NATO', 'peacekeepers', 'Chechnya', 'Umm', 'THAT', 'WOULD', 'BE', 'AN', 'INVASION', 'OF', 'SOVREIGN', 'RUSSIAN', 'TERRITORY', 'AND', 'AN', 'ACT', 'OF', 'WAR', 'President', 'staff', 'movie', 'actually', 'Russians', 'would', 'call', 'day', 'launched', 'massive', 'nuclear', 'strike', 'Russia', 'crippling', 'Russian', 'military', 'undoubtedly', 'killing', 'millions', 'people', 'leaving', 'only', 'several', 'hundred', 'nuclear', 'weapons', 'ARE', 'YOU', 'ME', 'would', 'hit', 'back', 'everything', 'had', 'also', 'absurd', 'government', 'would', 'immediately', 'assume', 'Russian', 'government', 'would', 'be', 'what', 'obviously', 'terrorist', 'act', 'respond', 'matter', 'hours.Worst', 'most', 'unbelievably', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'supposedly', 'CIA', 'agent', '14', 'months', 'experience', 'convinces', 'Russia', 'U.S.', 'back', 'down', 'de', 'facto', 'state', 'war', 'hunch', 'HA.Now', 'just', 'little', 'points', 'die-hards', 'would', 'notice', 'Hmmm', 'American', 'spy', 'ordering', 'two', 'Ukrainian', 'guards', 'voluntarily', 'disarm', 'when', 'could', 'easily', 'kill', 'idea', 'U.S.', 'Navy', 'carrier', 'battle', 'group', 'equipped', 'cutting', 'edge', 'radar', 'systems', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'pick', 'up', 'flight', 'Backfire', 'Bombers', 'full', 'afterburner', 'vintage-70', 'russian', 'radar', 'could', 'pick', 'up', 'U.S.', 'stealth', 'bombers', 'are', 'INVISIBLE', 'TO', 'RADAR', 'way', 'B-2', 'would', 'fly', 'north', 'pole', 'not', 'Poland', 'feel', 'movie', 'could', '[', 'upset', ']', 'Russians', 'who', 'may', 'happen', 'see', 'something', 'think', 'should', 'be', 'considered', 'time', 'when', 'Russian', 'President', 'bending', 'backwards', 'build', 'new', 'reltaionship', 'America', 'facing', 'considerable', 'amount', 'criticism', 'home.The', 'audience', 'was', 'literally', 'laughing', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'showing', 'saw.So', 'up', 'Political', 'Correctness', 'BADAwful', 'plot', 'BAD=BAD', 'MOVIE']",N/A
