1382657,A16JFF5OFSC0ZE,B0042AGNBE,Cuthbert J. Twiddle,"[2, 4]","Thanks to the young writer/director's manipulation of the audience, what should be and starts out as a sweet love story involving an elderly couple turns into a real bummer. Good and even great movies can of course have bummer endings but in this case nothing really rings true about the plot development at the end of the film. The movie takes a totally illogical and unnecessary left turn two thirds the way through just to achieve a surprise and ultimately depressing ending. Mine is obviously a minority opinion but I thoroughly disliked this film. If you're looking for a better representation of old age and the pain of dementia I'd suggest you check out ""Away From Her"" or ""The Notebook"" and skip this turkey. I give it two stars only for the fine performances of the two main leads.",2,I'm An Old Guy...and I Hated It!,1363737600,"03 20, 2013",2013,790,"['Thanks', 'young', 'writer/director', 'manipulation', 'audience', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'out', 'sweet', 'love', 'story', 'involving', 'elderly', 'couple', 'real', 'bummer', 'Good', 'even', 'great', 'movies', 'can', 'course', 'have', 'bummer', 'endings', 'case', 'nothing', 'really', 'true', 'plot', 'development', 'end', 'film', 'movie', 'totally', 'illogical', 'unnecessary', 'left', 'turn', 'two', 'thirds', 'way', 'just', 'achieve', 'surprise', 'ultimately', 'depressing', 'ending', 'Mine', 'obviously', 'minority', 'opinion', 'thoroughly', 'disliked', 'film', ""'re"", 'looking', 'better', 'representation', 'old', 'age', 'pain', 'dementia', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'check', 'Away', 'Notebook', 'skip', 'turkey', 'give', 'two', 'only', 'fine', 'performances', 'two', 'main', 'leads']","Lovely, Still"
1382658,A2FDFWRBCU8ERY,B0042AGNBE,Daddy,"[2, 3]","Lovely, Still is both a love story and an intense drama of a man losing his mind. Martin Landau plays Robert, an elderly man who lives alone and falls in love with his neighbor, Mary (Ellen Burstyn).  Watching the two fall in love and build a relationship is wonderfully touching and truly romantic. However, there is a sad truth to the story which makes their relationship all the more meaningful.  Ordinarilly, I would never give away the ending to spoil it for those who haven't seen it. But, in this case, it is important to know the outcome if you are to truly understand the significance of the story. Robert has a severe case of Alzheimer's... he has completely forgotten his life; that he is already married to Mary, and they have grown children, whom he thinks are just neighborhood friends. As to why he lives in the house alone, I never understood. Perhaps, his family agreed to move out in order to keep Robert from being upset by their presence... since he views them as strangers. There are many sad and intense scenes of Robert alone in the house, and trying to remember his life... even struggling with the daily tasks of dressing, washing, eating. I think the movie could have been made with a little less sadness and with more insight into the outcome... instead of the ""twist"" ending which explains everything.  For this reason, I rate it with four stars instead of five. Otherwise, it is a superb movie and a very endearing story. Laundau and Burstyn are magnificent in their very personable performances. This movie will affect you in many ways.  It is a testament to enduring love.",4,Love endures,1356825600,"12 30, 2012",2012,1603,"['Lovely', 'Still', 'love', 'story', 'intense', 'drama', 'man', 'losing', 'mind', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'Robert', 'elderly', 'man', 'who', 'alone', 'love', 'neighbor', 'Mary', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'Watching', 'two', 'fall', 'love', 'build', 'relationship', 'wonderfully', 'touching', 'truly', 'romantic', 'However', 'sad', 'truth', 'story', 'relationship', 'more', 'meaningful', 'Ordinarilly', 'would', 'never', 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'spoil', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'case', 'important', 'know', 'outcome', 'are', 'truly', 'understand', 'significance', 'story', 'Robert', 'severe', 'case', 'Alzheimer', 'completely', 'forgotten', 'life', 'already', 'married', 'Mary', 'have', 'grown', 'children', 'whom', 'are', 'just', 'neighborhood', 'friends', 'why', 'house', 'alone', 'never', 'understood', 'Perhaps', 'family', 'agreed', 'move', 'out', 'order', 'keep', 'Robert', 'being', 'upset', 'presence', 'strangers', 'are', 'many', 'sad', 'intense', 'scenes', 'Robert', 'alone', 'house', 'trying', 'remember', 'life', 'even', 'struggling', 'daily', 'tasks', 'dressing', 'washing', 'eating', 'think', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'little', 'less', 'sadness', 'more', 'insight', 'outcome', 'instead', 'twist', 'ending', 'everything', 'reason', 'rate', 'four', 'stars', 'instead', 'five', 'Otherwise', 'superb', 'movie', 'very', 'endearing', 'story', 'Laundau', 'Burstyn', 'are', 'magnificent', 'very', 'personable', 'performances', 'movie', 'will', 'affect', 'many', 'ways', 'testament', 'enduring', 'love']","Lovely, Still"

1382661,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B0042AGNBE,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[5, 5]","LOVELY, STILL (2010) is one of the most touching, moving and frightening films I have ever had the privilege to watch. Set in Omaha, Nebraska in a neighborhood that reminds me of my own, this is going to be a tough film to review. To begin on a hard note: why are such great films always ""art-house"" things that get seen mostly in Canada? Why did this $5 million dollar film rake in a lousy $4,500 opening weekend and gross a total of under $125,000?You tell me ... after you've seen it!My perennial favorite and legend Martin Landau stars as Robert Malone, a gaunt, lonely old man who seems haunted by his lack of a life and soul. He's a sweet old man, to be sure, and he gets along well enough - but it seems like he's traveled such a long road all by himself. He bags groceries at a local little market and makes his way home each day; it's an unbreakable routine one would expect of a mentally disabled person. Well, we can see Robert is normal ....Robert meets Mary (Ellen Burstyn), whom he first sees at work. Soon they are dating, and the scenes with Robert seeking dating advice are laugh-out-loud. Landau, everyone forgets, can be fall-down funny one moment and quite frightening the next. His goofy boss Mike (Adam Scott) is a portrait of incompetent fun. Mary's daughter Alex (Elizabeth Banks) is a beautiful yet apparently tormented creature. There's a lot happening here that you wouldn't begin to believe.Yet all I can tell you is it happens too often - every day, to too many people. You must see this funny, heart-warming, heart-wrenching film and discover why we are who we are. Nothing more may be divulged, or it will really sort of dampen your first viewing of the film. If you've seen it already, you'll KNOW how good it is.More importantly, you may discover some secrets you never thought you could understand.With incredible cinematography, a color palette that surges according to the mood, and a charming, quirky soundtrack to pull it together, this may be one of the finest films I have ever seen.Not certain if I'll ever decide the answer to that, I tell you: get this film and experience it for yourself.

It was playing at a film festival that I attend annually and was my favorite out of more than 25 movies I caught that year.First off, this movie was especially well written.  If you are tired of the regurgitated swill that Hollywood increasingly produces this will definitely appeal to you.As you watch the movie, the characters are well developed and honest.  They could be your neighbor or a friend.  The acting was exceptional and believable as an elderly man slowly loses his ability to connect with the world around him.But beware -things are never what they appear on the surface.If you like a good love story that doesn't need sex and violence to ""enhance"" your enjoyment, this qualifies as an experience to be savored.  The plot line is well developed but provides a surprise that few will foresee.Furthermore, several of my movie friend's stated that when watching it a second time, you catch greater subtleties within the premise of the movie and that they actually enjoyed it even more.
