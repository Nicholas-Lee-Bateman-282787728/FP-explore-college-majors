1687789,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00H9LHVHI,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 3]","Who ever thought that it was a good idea for Tobey Maguire to narrate anything?  I mean, have these casting directors ever heard him talk?  Can you honestly tell me that you like listening to his whiney voice tell you everything that you can see clearly and don&#8217;t need narrated?  I mean, I absolutely hate narration for the sake of narration (oh, let&#8217;s tell a story) but if I have to suffer through someone vocalize every event on the screen, at least make their voice soothing or enjoyable.  When you factor in that the character Maguire is vocalizing is previously portrayed (in a two minute sequence, but still) by Dylan Minnette who has a voice that is drastically deeper than Maguire&#8217;s, it all feels so dumb.  I already had to suffer through his terrible narration in &#8216;The Great Gatsby&#8217;, but at least he was a prominent actor there.  Here, he bakes a pie.  They could have got anyone to do that.I promise, this isn&#8217;t a review of Tobey Maguire, the actor that never was.Anyways, that was the first thought that I had while watching &#8216;Labor Day&#8217;.  The second thought I had was &#8220;why is Jason Reitman directing this?&#8221;  I ask that because nothing about &#8216;Labor Day&#8217; feels like a Reitman film, which is odd since he has, until this moment, carried such a distinct style of filmmaking.  &#8216;Thank Your For Smoking&#8217;, &#8216;Juno&#8217;, &#8216;Up in the Air&#8217;, &#8216;Young Adult&#8217;&#8230;while all different films all share a very similar tonal structure.  He knows how to make a really biting dramedy.&#8216;Labor Day&#8217; is not a dramedy.&#8216;Labor Day&#8217; tells the story of Adele, a single mother living alone with her son, harboring a tortured past that has left her emotionally unmovable and pretty much incapable of human interaction.  Her son, Henry, assumes that she has slipped into depression thanks to his father, Gerald, leaving her for his secretary, but comments made in passing paint a picture that reaches back further than that.  Adele never leaves the home, but once a month to get supplies.  On one of these ventures out into the world, they come across Frank.  He&#8217;s bleeding and obviously on the run and he pushes himself on Adele and her son and winds up at their house.  He explains that he&#8217;s an escaped convict and just needs a place to hide out until nightfall.  What was supposed to be a single day lasts much longer as Adele and Frank start to fall in love and plan a life together, with Henry at their side.  Their pasts come to the fore and their secrets are revealed and, well, there will be much sadness.What to say, what to say?  First, that pie making scene made me hungrier than I&#8217;ve ever been while watching a movie; no joke.  Second, the second half of this movie was so much sadness on top of sadness that I couldn&#8217;t even process it fast enough to care.  Adele&#8217;s backstory is sad enough, but then Frank gets into explaining what happened to him and why he was arrested and it&#8217;s a whole ton of misery and I was just thinking &#8220;they&#8217;re trying way to hard&#8221; which also added to the fact that this film just doesn&#8217;t feel cinematic.It feels very much like a Lifetime movie.That isn&#8217;t to say that the people involved here don&#8217;t try.  Both Kate Winslet and Josh Brolin are excellent here.  Winslet is especially superb, channeling Adele&#8217;s bottled misery in a way that feels authentic and heartbreaking, and then slowly breaking her out of her shell, while still keeping hold of the ticks that make it hard for her to interact with the real world around her.  Still, these performances aren&#8217;t enough to overcome the film&#8217;s weaknesses, especially when certain unnecessary characters come around and stink up the whole joint.Yes, I&#8217;m talking about you Brighid Fleming and your terrible character, Eleanor.It would have been nice if Reitman could have adapted this story in a way that felt more his own, but instead he created a film that could have been directed by any no-name director with no style or knack for storytelling.  It all feels so blandly constructed and obvious, and the sappy ending felt completely unnatural.  I really wanted this to be something special, but instead it came and went and was completely forgotten, for a reason.",3,Once (a week) in a lifetime (movie)&#8230;,1399593600,"05 9, 2014",2014,4360,"['Who', 'ever', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'idea', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'narrate', 'anything', 'mean', 'have', 'casting', 'directors', 'ever', 'heard', 'talk', 'Can', 'honestly', 'tell', 'like', 'listening', 'whiney', 'voice', 'tell', 'everything', 'can', 'see', 'clearly', 'don', '8217', 'need', 'narrated', 'mean', 'absolutely', 'hate', 'narration', 'sake', 'narration', 'oh', 'let', '8217', 's', 'tell', 'story', 'have', 'suffer', 'someone', 'vocalize', 'event', 'screen', 'least', 'make', 'voice', 'soothing', 'enjoyable', 'When', 'factor', 'character', 'Maguire', 'vocalizing', 'previously', 'portrayed', 'two', 'minute', 'sequence', 'still', 'Dylan', 'Minnette', 'who', 'voice', 'drastically', 'deeper', 'Maguire', '8217', 'feels', 'so', 'dumb', 'already', 'had', 'suffer', 'terrible', 'narration', '8216', 'Great', 'Gatsby', '8217', 'least', 'was', 'prominent', 'actor', 'there', 'Here', 'pie', 'could', 'have', 'got', 'anyone', 'do', 'that.I', 'promise', 'isn', '8217', 'review', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'actor', 'never', 'was', 'first', 'thought', 'had', 'watching', '8216', 'Labor', 'Day', '8217', 'second', 'thought', 'had', 'was', '8220', 'why', 'Jason', 'Reitman', 'directing', '8221', 'ask', 'nothing', '8216', 'Labor', 'Day', '8217', 'feels', 'Reitman', 'film', 'odd', 'moment', 'carried', 'such', 'distinct', 'style', 'filmmaking', '8216', 'Thank', 'Smoking', '8217', '8216', 'Juno', '8217', '8216', 'Up', 'Air', '8217', '8216', 'Young', 'Adult', '8217', '8230', 'different', 'films', 'share', 'very', 'similar', 'tonal', 'structure', 'how', 'make', 'really', 'biting', 'dramedy.', '8216', 'Labor', 'Day', '8217', 'not', 'dramedy.', '8216', 'Labor', 'Day', '8217', 'story', 'Adele', 'single', 'mother', 'living', 'alone', 'son', 'harboring', 'tortured', 'past', 'left', 'emotionally', 'unmovable', 'pretty', 'much', 'incapable', 'human', 'interaction', 'son', 'Henry', 'slipped', 'depression', 'thanks', 'father', 'Gerald', 'leaving', 'secretary', 'comments', 'made', 'passing', 'paint', 'picture', 'back', 'further', 'Adele', 'never', 'home', 'once', 'month', 'get', 'supplies', 'one', 'ventures', 'out', 'world', 'come', 'Frank', '8217', 'bleeding', 'obviously', 'run', 'Adele', 'son', 'up', 'house', '8217', 'escaped', 'convict', 'just', 'place', 'hide', 'out', 'What', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'single', 'day', 'much', 'longer', 'Adele', 'Frank', 'start', 'fall', 'love', 'plan', 'life', 'together', 'Henry', 'side', 'pasts', 'come', 'fore', 'secrets', 'are', 'revealed', 'well', 'will', 'be', 'much', 'say', 'what', 'say', 'First', 'making', 'scene', 'made', 'hungrier', '8217', 'ever', 'been', 'watching', 'movie', 'joke', 'Second', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'sadness', 'top', 'sadness', 'couldn', '8217', 'even', 'process', 'fast', 'enough', 'care', 'Adele', '8217', 's', 'backstory', 'sad', 'enough', 'then', 'Frank', 'explaining', 'what', 'happened', 'why', 'was', 'arrested', '8217', 'whole', 'ton', 'misery', 'was', 'just', 'thinking', '8220', '8217', 're', 'trying', 'way', 'hard', '8221', 'also', 'added', 'fact', 'film', 'just', 'doesn', '8217', 'feel', 'cinematic.It', 'feels', 'very', 'much', 'Lifetime', 'isn', '8217', 't', 'say', 'people', 'involved', 'here', 'don', '8217', 't', 'try', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'are', 'excellent', 'here', 'Winslet', 'especially', 'superb', 'channeling', 'Adele', '8217', 'bottled', 'misery', 'way', 'authentic', 'heartbreaking', 'then', 'slowly', 'breaking', 'shell', 'still', 'keeping', 'hold', 'ticks', 'make', 'hard', 'interact', 'real', 'world', 'Still', 'performances', 'aren', '8217', 'enough', 'overcome', 'film', '8217', 's', 'weaknesses', 'especially', 'when', 'certain', 'unnecessary', 'characters', 'come', 'around', 'stink', 'up', 'whole', 'joint.Yes', '8217', 'talking', 'Brighid', 'Fleming', 'terrible', 'character', 'Eleanor.It', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'Reitman', 'could', 'have', 'adapted', 'story', 'way', 'felt', 'more', 'own', 'instead', 'created', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'directed', 'no-name', 'director', 'style', 'knack', 'storytelling', 'feels', 'so', 'blandly', 'constructed', 'obvious', 'sappy', 'ending', 'felt', 'completely', 'unnatural', 'really', 'wanted', 'be', 'something', 'special', 'instead', 'came', 'went', 'was', 'completely', 'forgotten', 'reason']",Labor Day

1687795,A2VJE2FIA8O2CO,B00H9LHVHI,Brandon I,"[0, 0]","I haven&#8217;t had a chance to see Labor Day since the Telluride Film Festival but my affections for it still hold strong. It continues to be one of my favorite films from Telluride 2013 and was in my top 10 of last year. I absolutely adore Jason Reitman&#8217;s films, especially Up in the Air, which I saw three times in theaters. It has left me in tears many times, and I&#8217;m sure it will do so many more times. Clearly, I have a pro-Reitman bias.However, Labor Day is a very different film for Reitman. Rather than being sharp and quick-witted, it&#8217;s careful and considered. Before the Telluride screening, he introduced the film as a story about love, so I was shocked when the film began as a thriller in which an escaped convict kidnaps a single mother and her 12-year-old son. Although still as Reitman said, it&#8217;s a gentle, loving story.  Rather than following someone dodging police bullets or breaking into buildings, Reitman lets the camera calmly glide up streets and around trees in the quiet yet intense New England setting or watch three people bake a pie together.The sincerity of Labor Day allows it to be about whatever you relate to. I latched onto the films ideas about parenting. The boy&#8217;s father is around once a week, but is not truly mindful and present with his son. Somehow this escaped convict comes into their lives, and touches both mother and son, because he truly pays attention to them. Only a great filmmaker can take a seemingly absurd premise and put the whole theater in tears. Reitman achieves this with grace, further revealing how exceptionally talented he is.Grade: A",5,LOVE it,1400025600,"05 14, 2014",2014,1629,"['haven', '8217', 't', 'had', 'chance', 'see', 'Labor', 'Day', 'Telluride', 'Film', 'Festival', 'affections', 'still', 'hold', 'strong', 'be', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'Telluride', '2013', 'was', 'top', '10', 'last', 'year', 'absolutely', 'Jason', 'Reitman', '8217', 's', 'films', 'especially', 'Up', 'Air', 'saw', 'three', 'times', 'theaters', 'left', 'tears', 'many', 'times', '8217', 'sure', 'will', 'do', 'so', 'many', 'more', 'times', 'Clearly', 'have', 'pro-Reitman', 'bias.However', 'Labor', 'Day', 'very', 'different', 'film', 'Reitman', 'Rather', 'being', 'sharp', 'quick-witted', '8217', 'careful', 'considered', 'Telluride', 'screening', 'introduced', 'film', 'story', 'love', 'was', 'shocked', 'when', 'film', 'began', 'thriller', 'escaped', 'convict', 'single', 'mother', '12-year-old', 'son', 'still', 'Reitman', 'said', '8217', 's', 'gentle', 'loving', 'story', 'Rather', 'following', 'someone', 'dodging', 'police', 'bullets', 'breaking', 'buildings', 'Reitman', 'camera', 'calmly', 'glide', 'streets', 'trees', 'quiet', 'yet', 'intense', 'New', 'England', 'setting', 'watch', 'three', 'people', 'bake', 'pie', 'together.The', 'sincerity', 'Labor', 'Day', 'be', 'relate', 'latched', 'films', 'ideas', 'parenting', 'boy', '8217', 'father', 'around', 'once', 'week', 'not', 'truly', 'mindful', 'present', 'son', 'Somehow', 'escaped', 'convict', 'lives', 'touches', 'mother', 'son', 'truly', 'attention', 'Only', 'great', 'filmmaker', 'can', 'take', 'seemingly', 'absurd', 'premise', 'put', 'whole', 'theater', 'tears', 'Reitman', 'grace', 'further', 'revealing', 'how', 'exceptionally', 'talented', 'is.Grade']",Labor Day

1687817,A31LHED3SKLWVB,B00H9LHVHI,Darren,"[0, 0]","Jason Reitman's first foray into total earnestness, based on a novel by Joyce Maynard that, if this movie is any guide, is a rather simple romance novel bubbling under a piecrust of literary pretension.  The pretension, at least in the film, starts with the world-weary narration by Tobey Maguire that looks back on adolescence in the manner of Fitzegerald's Nick Carroway, of Stryon's Stingo from &#34;Sophie's Choice&#34;, of ... well, J.D. Salinger's Holden Caulfield.  Not coincidentally, Maynard is famous for having an affair with the famously reclusive Salinger back in the early 70s, when she was 18 and he 53.  I leave it to the reader of this review to decide who's the creepiest between the two, though at least Salinger didn't write a profitable tell-all about the affair (or sell intimate correspondence at auction).Along with the Salingeresque New Hampshire setting, we get the miserable Salingeresque 7th grader, racked by puberty and worry over his mother, Kate Winslet.  Winslet is a basket-case who can barely go out in public.  Her hands shake.  She needs to wash her hair.  (She's sexy anyway.)  Her house is falling apart.  Her tires need changing.  The father took off a long time ago and is remarried in a nice house across town.  The son tries to ameliorate Winslet's depression by being a &#34;substitute husband&#34;: washing the dishes for a week, mowing the lawn, changing lightbulbs, taking his mother out for movie-dates ... well, given that his mother looks like Kate Winslet, we can see where this is going -- straight to the psychiatrist's office, and who can blame the kid.  (Winslet's monologues to him about &#34;longing&#34; and &#34;desire&#34; aren't helping, either.)  The situation is saved by the arrival of Josh Brolin, a prison escapee.  Winslet and her son are so miserable that Stockholm Syndrome doesn't even apply -- they're grateful for the variety.The whole picture is very well done, but, as other some other reviewers here have noted, things are just a bit off.  The 13-year-old in this movie is a novelist's construct, not a real kid.  The first words out of a real kid's mouth would be: &#34;Mom, stop acting so WEIRD!  Goddd!&#34;  And as for Brolin?  Oh dear.  Here's a convict who just flattened almost 20 years in a penitentiary, and he's well-spoken, good with kids (even kids in wheelchairs), he fixes things around the house, and he can cook.  Not only that, he can BAKE.  We're in romance-novel land here, not High Lit, despite Maynard's literary reputation.  Perhaps she's still trying to construct that elusive Perfect Man all these years later after J.D. let her down.  Who knows, I'm not a shrink; just a critic who knows sentimental nonsense when he sees it.  I'm also reading here that this is being compared unfavorably to Nicholas Sparks' work, but let's be entirely fair to Maynard: this story is what Sparks aspires to.  I've only seen the movies, but I seriously doubt that he's a better prose stylist than Maynard.  And it can't be said that the first section when mother and son encounter Brolin isn't gripping, nor can it be said that the crisis sequence isn't tense. The idea of small-town watchfulness belongs to Maynard; the perfectly-paced execution of the idea is all Reitman.Despite a sag in the middle, good direction by Reitman.  Brolin at least has the demeanor of a long-time con (even if what the script has him doing isn't realistic in the slightest).  Winslet is dependably excellent.  There's a lot to enjoy here.  And Maynard has the sense to know that her readers like a good din to go with their romance and suspense: we're shown, step-by-step, how to make a tasty chili and how to bake a heavenly peach pie.  3 out of 5 -- second star for the performances, third star for the recipes.

1687819,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B00H9LHVHI,David Baldwin,"[1, 2]","""Labor Day"" requires a lot of patience to reap the rewards that aren't apparent from the start of the film.  Henry Wheeler (Gattlin Griffith) lives with his shut-in mother, Adele (Kate Winslet), and has basically assumed the parental function because of her inability to fully function in the maternal role.  While shopping one day in one of the rare times Adele goes out to the public they are kidnapped by an escaped prisoner, Frank Granger (Josh Brolin), and commandeered into taking him to their house to hideout, a ramshackle abode in a sleepy Massachusetts hamlet.  Quickly Frank makes himself handy massaging the feet of a bound Adele and feeding her seductively his homemade chili while she's tied up.  Adele  untethered the two are soon making peach pie erotically kneading the dough in the process.  Shades of Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore in ""Ghost""!  I was ready to dismiss this film as a routine chick flick or, worse yet, a cinematic Harlequin romance.  Never fear, though.  We're in the hands of director Jason Reitman who bought us ""Up in the Air"" and the criminally maligned ""Young Adult"".  What Reitman and Winslet are attempting here is very subtle.  Utilizing flashbacks and a highly modulated performance by Winslet it dawns on you that this film is more than a romance but a portrait of a woman in turmoil. Meticulously Winslet charts the progressions of a woman in excruciating emotional pain.  With scant histrionics and few acting ticks Winslet  suggests a woman in crisis due to circumstances in her past.  Her work here is an example of why she is in the top tier of contemporary screen actresses.  Ultimately it's heartbreaking but the film steers itself from the verge of mawkishness on the strength of Winslet's turn.  Brolin is good, too, but this film isn't really about him unless it concerns you whether he committed the murder he was incarcerated for or not.  Ultimately that little nugget is unimportant or inconsequential to the film.  Young Griffith is good in a role that belies his years and he more than holds his own with the older actors.  ""Labor Day"" kind of disappeared from the larger screens when released last Winter probably due to poor or misleading marketing.

I really don&#8217;t think so, but be wary anyway. I was going to see this while it was in the theater, but it got past over for an Oscar nod, so I waited until it cam out on DVD. There were just too many movies to see that were nominated and I didn&#8217;t have time to bother with the ones that weren&#8217;t. I am kind of a nerd and try to watch as many of the Oscar noms as I can before the Oscars. I wouldn&#8217;t say I should have seen this in the theaters because, as I said I just didn&#8217;t have time. I am glad that I did eventually see it. If I had known how good it was, I would&#8217;ve seen it sooner. When I saw the preview for it, I remember my friend said, &#8220;I hope there is more to this movie than that&#8221;. Well there really isn&#8217;t. It is just about Josh Brolin escaping from prison and holding Kate Winslett and her son hostage for Labor Day weekend and they all come to love each other. You would think it would be boring, but it wasn&#8217;t boring at all. It was actually pretty riveting. The acting and character development were flawless. Josh Brolin is just too good to be true. I don&#8217;t care if he&#8217;s a convict, I want to marry him. I thought time was a little askew though. At one point, I thought it must be Monday now and it was only Friday. I thought, wow Josh Brolin did all that in like a day. He fixes their car and a bunch of other things. I love the relationship that grows not only with Winslett, but her son.

1687834,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00H9LHVHI,FNDNreview,"[2, 3]","Directed by Jason Reitman (Up in the Air, Juno) and based on the novel of the same name by Joyce Maynard, Labor Day stars Kate Winslet as Adele Wheeler &#8211; a divorced mother of one that suffers from depression.  One day, while clothes shopping with her 13-year-old-son, Henry (Gattlin Griffith), she is approached by a stranger, Frank Chambers (Josh Brolin), who forces her to take him to their home.  Initially appearing to be threatening, Frank managers to ease Adele and Henry&#8217;s fear &#8211; even despite the fact that he reveals that he&#8217;s an escaped convict and on the run.Frank is wanted for murder, but he claims he&#8217;s never intentionally hurt anyone and just needs a place to hide out over the Labor Day weekend until he can catch a train out of town.  In return for their silence, Frank graciously volunteers his help by making home repairs, cooking, etc.  Adele and Henry quickly take to Frank, not having a man around the house &#8211; at least since Adele&#8217;s husband, Gerald (Clark Gregg), left and remarried.As the story progresses, flashbacks ensue reliving the events leading up to the death that eventually landed Frank in jail.  Even despite his past, Adele doesn&#8217;t ask questions and quickly falls for him.  However, with neighbors randomly stopping by to check up on Adele and police constantly patrolling the area, it&#8217;s not visible for them to remain in Adele&#8217;s house.  They devise a plan to make a run for it and head to Canada &#8211; but they must attempt to do so without bringing attention to themselves.Labor Day is really a three-person story all rolled into one, the first of which belongs to the character portrayed by Kate Winslet.  It&#8217;s becoming harder and harder to find adjectives to describe the flawless acting ability that she possesses.  In all honesty, a movie can be just dreadful, but at least if Kate&#8217;s in the film, you are guaranteed to have at least one character that will not disappoint you.  And, her portrayal of Adele Wheeler is no exception.  Portraying a depressed mother that&#8217;s suffered through the hardship of a failed marriage while trying to raise her only son has never looked as good.  Her character&#8217;s emotional state in this film says it all, conveying heartbreak, compassion, and unconditional love.  If for no other reason, you should watch this film for the sheer excellence of Kate Winslet.While Winslet shines ever so brightly through the entirety of this film, so does her co-star, Josh Brolin.  In my opinion, Brolin is one of the most under appreciated actors in Hollywood.  Sure, his resume is full of relatively obscure roles, such as his portrayal of George W. Bush in W. or Llewelyn Moss in No Country for Old Men, but his stock as a leading man is continuously on the rise &#8211; even more so after his role as Frank Chambers.  The prominence of his character is evident in the duel storylines about Frank, one young and one in the present storyline.  Brolin portrays an appreciative authority character that knows the value of freedom and utter importance of family.  His on-screen chemistry with Winslet is blatantly obvious and is one of the reasons this film will put a strangle hold on your attention for its duration.Lastly, Labor Day is also a coming-of-age story for Adele&#8217;s son, Henry.  The film begins with voiceover work from Toby Maguire who briefly portrays Henry in the film&#8217;s final moments.  But, for the majority of the film, Gattlin Griffith carries the character on his shoulders.  Henry is an impressionable character, reminiscent of Duncan (Liam James) in another recent &#8220;growing up&#8221; film, The Way Way Back.  And, while Griffith does an admirable job of holding his own in scenes with Winslet and Brolin, he shines the most during interactions with his rather ambitious, charismatic &#8220;girlfriend,&#8221; &#8211; portrayed by Brighid Fleming.  The film&#8217;s lighthearted, humorous moments also unexpectedly come from the two young actors.Obviously, the acting is outstanding in this film, yet the most annoying part of watching this movie is the fact that it&#8217;s another prime example of having too much of its plot given away by the two-minute movie trailer.  In the event that you&#8217;ve the trailer, then you can probably image the direction in which this works towards.  Regardless, the only drawback of the film is the slightly clunky plot progression.  In one particular scene, now acting as a family, Frank, Adele, and Henry are all in the kitchen making a pie together.  That&#8217;s right, for about five minutes, you watch three people make a pie.  No joke &#8211; it will feel like you&#8217;re watching the Food Network.  However, the good news is this scene becomes a massively important plot point. And, if you still don&#8217;t care for this flick by the time the credits roll, you&#8217;ll at least understand what kind of work goes into making a pie.Overall, Labor Day is enjoyable mostly because of the tremendous acting performances from both Kate Winslet and Josh Brolin.  Unfortunately it does have its slow moments, though.  About half way through this movie, you will likely be rethinking your choice to watch it &#8211; but do yourself a favor and hang in there.  It gets extremely interesting and have you heart pounding a bit right around the midway point.  For me personally, the ending was the selling point.  The conclusion will tie everything together nicely and leave many reaching for a tissue to dry their eyes.  It might be a bit of a spoiler, but for those of you worrying about the possibilities of a melancholy ending, rest assured that won&#8217;t be the case here.GRADE:  B-FNDNreview.com",4,Superb acting

Now on DVD perhaps this very sensitive and wondrously acted film will achieve a wider audience. It is a love story, simply that - and unfortunately the trailers for the film suggested another kind of `Taken' theme. Wrong.Adele (Kate Winslet) is in a state of depression since her husband left her for his secretary after she failed to have another live birth to complement their family of three: Henry (a brilliant Gattlin Griffith) is left behind to care for his near agoraphobic mother. The two of hem in shopping for some suitable clothes for school (the weekend is Labor Day weekend in New Hampshire) encounter a wounded man Frank (Josh Brolin) who asked for a ride - to their home. Frank has just escaped prison where he was undergoing an appendectomy and jumped out the window to escape. (Frank was imprisoned for murdering his wife, which was not actually a murder but a tragic set of circumstances surrounding his infant son - a fact we learn through flashbacks). Frank allows Adele to tend to his wound, but reassures both Adele and Henry he has no intention of hurting them - he just needs a place to rest until dark. But gradually Frank endears himself to Henry and to Adele and they become a family despite the police search that is constantly threatening their privacy. The manner in which this all plays out is as sensitive a love story as has been filmed.

Writer/director Jason Reitman (""Up in the Air""), working with Joyce Maynard's novel, really knows how to manipulate us. At the beginning we are hesitant, particularly in the early scenes, which threaten to become mawkish (yeah, the peach pie); but soon, through flashbacks, we come to understand our characters, and the film suddenly becomes unpredictable and involving. Nice switch!We watch:* Kate Winslet (""Contagion"") as Adele, the clinically depressed mother who is forced to shelter an escaped convict in order to protect her son.* Josh Brolin (""Gangster Squad"") plays Frank, a felon who escaped from the hospital where he had an emergency appendectomy. He tells her ""things aren't like they seem.""* Gattlin Griffith (""Green Lantern"") is Henry, the boy is struggling to help his mother, who is practically agoraphobic. He sorts through bits of information gleaned from her, a classmate, and his father.* Maika Monroe (""The Bling Ring"") is Mandy, the classmate, overflowing with youthful theories about life, love, sex and family dynamics.* Clark Gregg (""Much Ado About Nothing"") is Gerald, Adele's former husband. He knows he has let his son Henry down and regrets it.* James Van Der Beek (Lots of TV) is the ultra-helpful Officer Treadwell. If only he weren't quite so diligent...* Tobey Maguire (""The Great Gatsby"") is the adult Henry.The casting of the younger versions of our main characters is extremely good, with the glaring exception of Toby Maguire as the adult Henry. The first couple of flashbacks confused me; until I realized that we were seeing flashbacks for BOTH of the lead characters.

Polhemus ""Book Collector""","[1, 1]","Once in a while a rare film comes along that simply dazzles in its simplicity, its skewed characters, its interior life fomenting to be loosed. ""Labor Day"" is just such a film. I absolutely love this movie.When one considers life, one possibly thinks of Good winning, of normal people living out their lives. However, Jason Reitman considered those other people, those in need, those by-passed of happiness, of normalcy. These people live one day at a time--barely. Such is Kate Winslet's character, who suffers from depression, debilitating sadness, loss, and simply cannot get herself together. After so many mind-boggling miscarriages, her husband, a good man, cannot take any more and leaves, finds a new wife and starts a new life. Their son moves back and forth between his parents, although in this story, he is with his mother. He becomes the omniscient narrator who provides the viewer with back story and ongoing actions.Into their closed lives one day comes an intruder, a prison escapee. From the time he enters the story, I felt a bristling, an undercurrent, a sense of violence just waiting to explode. That's Josh Brolin, perfectly cast for this role. He reads immediately into the character of Adele, sensing that she is very lonely and troubled. He is gentle with her. Their growing attraction is beautifully drawn.But happiness in such doomed characters cannot last. Two new characters are introduced and it is through them that the love story is crushed. The viewer cannot help but weep for their loss. Life goes on. That incessant droning of inertia is re-instilled in both Frank's and Adele's lives. However, this is not a Nicholas Sparks story--no one dies. And the ending--the ending is magnificent! The viewer will weep here, too.My brother loves chick flick movies. I keep telling him this is a ""chick flick"" not to be missed, but he's not there--yet.

She isn&#8217;t. She allows herself to be swept off her feet by this potentially dangerous gentleman who seems too good to be true. Alas, they develop a passionate romance while Henry keeps to himself rooms away.&#34;Labor Day&#34; will or will not work for you depending on one factor - if you buy the core romance of the two characters. Frank&#8217;s back-story as well as Adele&#8217;s are examined in the film&#8217;s rocky third act, and they do add some clarity to these two wayward characters, but that back-story fills in the blank a little later than it should have.I enjoyed watching Winslet give a quality performance in a melodrama that took itself a little too seriously, played too safe, and is relatively joyless. &#8220;Labor Day&#8221; lacks the acid wit that flowed throughout &#8220;Up in the Air&#8221; and &#8220;Young Adult&#8221;. Those were both dramatic films, but they had strong comedic undertones and were very funny at times.Based on a novel by Joyce Maynard that I haven&#8217;t read, there might be a fan base for &#8220;Labor Day.&#8221; But I suspect the novel wasn&#8217;t as dry and formulaic as this film was. If you&#8217;ve seen anything from the Nicholas Sparks canon, you&#8217;ve basically got an idea of what lies in store for the audience in &#8220;Labor Day.&#8221; Unless you&#8217;ve really got a thing for star-crossed lover stories, you may be a little bored and find little to like here.Grade: C",2,"A slow, joyless love story with one standout performance",1398988800,"05 2, 2014",2014,2236,"['Jason', 'Reitman', 'nearly', 'perfect', 'track-record', 'when', 'films', 'directed', '8220', 'Thank', 'Smoking', '8221', '8220', 'Juno', '8221', '8220', 'Up', 'Air', '8221', '8220', 'Young', 'Adult', '8221', 'are', 'multi-layered', 'thought-provoking', 'devastatingly', 'funny', 'films', 'rewatch', 'value.', '34', 'Labor', 'Day', '34', 'old-fashioned', 'melodrama', 'star-crossed', 'lovers', 'Adele', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'depressed', 'husband', 'left', 'son', 'Henry', 'nearly', 'catatonic', 'state', 'where', '8217', 'leave', 'house', 'more', 'once', 'month', 'shop', 'household', 'necessities', 'One', 'day', 'when', 'Adele', 'Henry', 'are', 'out', 'shopping', 'nice-guy', 'convict', 'Frank', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'place', 'stay', 'law', 'hot', 'tail.', '34', '8217', 'lot', 'stronger', 'think', '34', 'Adele', 'Frank', 'isn', '8217', 'be', 'swept', 'off', 'feet', 'potentially', 'dangerous', 'gentleman', 'who', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'true', 'Alas', 'develop', 'passionate', 'romance', 'Henry', 'rooms', 'away.', '34', 'Labor', 'Day', '34', 'will', 'will', 'not', 'work', 'depending', 'one', 'factor', 'buy', 'core', 'romance', 'two', 'characters', 'Frank', '8217', 's', 'back-story', 'as', 'well', 'Adele', '8217', 'are', 'examined', 'film', '8217', 'rocky', 'third', 'act', 'do', 'add', 'clarity', 'two', 'wayward', 'characters', 'back-story', 'fills', 'blank', 'little', 'later', 'should', 'have.I', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'Winslet', 'give', 'quality', 'performance', 'melodrama', 'took', 'little', 'too', 'seriously', 'played', 'too', 'safe', 'relatively', 'joyless', '8220', 'Labor', 'Day', '8221', 'acid', 'wit', 'flowed', '8220', 'Up', 'Air', '8221', '8220', 'Young', 'Adult', '8221', 'were', 'dramatic', 'films', 'had', 'strong', 'comedic', 'undertones', 'were', 'very', 'funny', 'times.Based', 'novel', 'Joyce', 'Maynard', 'haven', '8217', 'read', 'might', 'be', 'fan', 'base', '8220', 'Labor', 'Day.', '8221', 'suspect', 'novel', 'wasn', '8217', 'dry', 'formulaic', 'film', 'was', '8217', 'seen', 'anything', 'Nicholas', 'Sparks', 'canon', '8217', 'basically', 'got', 'idea', 'what', 'store', 'audience', '8220', 'Labor', 'Day.', '8221', 'Unless', '8217', 'really', 'got', 'thing', 'star-crossed', 'lover', 'stories', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'bored', 'find', 'little', 'like', 'here.Grade', 'C']",Labor Day

1687906,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00H9LHVHI,Paul Allaer,"[86, 96]","""Labor Day"" (2014 release; 111 min.) brings the story of Adele (played by Kate Winslet), a thirty-something single mother with a son Henry (played by Gattlin Griffith) who is about to start 7th grade and whose voice-over guides the movie. Adele doesn't get out of the house a lot (much later in the movie we learn why in flashbacks) but one day she and Henry go to the local grocery store, and Henry gets cornered by some guy (played by Josh Brolin) who desperately needs a getaway ride. We later learn he is Frank, a convicted murderer who is on the run (much later in the movie we learn about the circumstances of his conviction). Adele and Henry drive him to their house. It isn't long before there is a connection of sorts between Adele and Frank, and Henry dryly observes that, among many different things they did, ""Frank ironed and in return my mom taught him how to rumba"", ha! With the cops still looking for Frank, eventually Frank and Adele must decide whether to make a run for it. To tell you more of the plot would surely spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to experience it for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie is directed and adopted for the screen by Jason Reitman, who previously brought us movies like Juno, Thank You For Smoking, Up In the Air and most recently Young Adult. If you look at that string of films, ""Labor Day"" is quite a departure for him. He probably wanted to stretch his legs, so to speak, and good for him. Second, this is really two movies into one. The first movie, played out in the first hour, focuses on the connection that is building between Adele and Frank (and indirectly with Henry as well), and I have to admit that I wasn't crazy about it, as it plays out pretty much as I would expect a Nicolas Sparks adaptation. Much better is the second half of the movie, where we wonder what is going to happen next as Adele and Frank, and also Henry, make some fateful decisions with long-lasting consequences. I will admit that by the end of the movie, I was tearing up. Third, the performances are quite good, which of course is almost a guarantee from Kate Winslet in any movie. Gattlin Griffith as her son is equally excellent. Check out the short appearance (maybe 5 min. of screen time) of Tobey Maguire at the very end of the movie, as the grown-up Henry. Last, but certainly not least, the movie score, by British composer Rolfe Kent, is nothing short of excellent.Bottom line: while the first half of the movie was not my cup of tea, the second half of the movie more than makes up for it, and in the end this was quite enjoyable, and better than I had expected. The movie opened today here in Cincinnati and the early evening screening I saw this at was not well attended (less than 10 people in a very large theatre). This doesn't bode well for the movie's box office fortunes. Be that as it may, in the end I enjoyed ""Labor Day"" more than expected, and I might suggest you check this out, be it in the theater or on DVD/Blu-ray.",4,"""He ironed and in return my mom taught him how to rumba""",1391126400,"01 31, 2014",2014,3020,"['Day', '2014', 'release', '111', 'min', 'story', 'Adele', 'played', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'thirty-something', 'single', 'mother', 'son', 'Henry', 'played', 'Gattlin', 'Griffith', 'who', 'start', '7th', 'grade', 'voice-over', 'movie', 'Adele', ""n't"", 'get', 'house', 'lot', 'much', 'later', 'movie', 'learn', 'why', 'flashbacks', 'one', 'day', 'Henry', 'go', 'local', 'grocery', 'store', 'Henry', 'cornered', 'guy', 'played', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'who', 'desperately', 'getaway', 'ride', 'later', 'learn', 'Frank', 'convicted', 'murderer', 'who', 'run', 'much', 'later', 'movie', 'learn', 'circumstances', 'conviction', 'Adele', 'Henry', 'drive', 'house', ""n't"", 'long', 'before', 'connection', 'sorts', 'Adele', 'Frank', 'Henry', 'dryly', 'many', 'different', 'things', 'did', 'Frank', 'ironed', 'return', 'mom', 'taught', 'how', 'rumba', 'ha', 'cops', 'still', 'looking', 'Frank', 'eventually', 'Frank', 'Adele', 'must', 'decide', 'make', 'run', 'tell', 'more', 'plot', 'would', 'surely', 'spoil', 'viewing', 'experience', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'experience', 'how', 'out.Couple', 'comments', 'movie', 'directed', 'adopted', 'screen', 'Jason', 'Reitman', 'who', 'previously', 'brought', 'movies', 'Juno', 'Thank', 'Smoking', 'Up', 'Air', 'most', 'recently', 'Young', 'Adult', 'look', 'string', 'films', 'Labor', 'Day', 'quite', 'departure', 'probably', 'wanted', 'stretch', 'legs', 'so', 'speak', 'good', 'Second', 'really', 'two', 'movies', 'one', 'first', 'movie', 'played', 'out', 'first', 'hour', 'connection', 'building', 'Adele', 'Frank', 'indirectly', 'Henry', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'admit', 'was', ""n't"", 'crazy', 'out', 'pretty', 'much', 'would', 'expect', 'Nicolas', 'Sparks', 'adaptation', 'Much', 'better', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'where', 'wonder', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'Adele', 'Frank', 'also', 'Henry', 'make', 'fateful', 'decisions', 'long-lasting', 'consequences', 'will', 'admit', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'tearing', 'up', 'Third', 'performances', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'course', 'almost', 'guarantee', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'movie', 'Gattlin', 'Griffith', 'son', 'equally', 'excellent', 'Check', 'short', 'appearance', 'maybe', '5', 'min', 'screen', 'time', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'very', 'end', 'movie', 'grown-up', 'Henry', 'Last', 'certainly', 'not', 'least', 'movie', 'score', 'British', 'composer', 'Rolfe', 'Kent', 'nothing', 'short', 'excellent.Bottom', 'line', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'cup', 'tea', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'more', 'up', 'end', 'was', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'better', 'had', 'expected', 'movie', 'opened', 'today', 'here', 'Cincinnati', 'early', 'evening', 'screening', 'saw', 'was', 'not', 'well', 'attended', 'less', '10', 'people', 'very', 'large', 'theatre', ""n't"", 'bode', 'well', 'movie', 'box', 'office', 'fortunes', 'Be', 'may', 'end', 'enjoyed', 'Labor', 'Day', 'more', 'expected', 'might', 'suggest', 'check', 'out', 'be', 'theater', 'DVD/Blu-ray']",Labor Day

1687913,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00H9LHVHI,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 0]","***1/2""Labor Day"" takes some highly improbable material and somehow makes it work - up to a point, at least.In fact, it's kind of hard to know exactly what to make of ""Labor Day"" at first blush. The movie, based on the novel by Joyce Maynard, tells the tale of a love- and sex-starved single mother (Kate Winslet) who falls in love with the ""dreamy"" escaped convict (Josh Brolin) who's holding her and her 13-year-old son (Gattlin Griffith) hostage in their rural home on Labor Day weekend 1987. For about the first 45 minutes or so, the movie actually seems to be endorsing the rather insulting romantic premise that all an attractive young woman needs to spice up her life is a gutter-cleaning, pie-making, baseball-instructing, son-loving man to come along and sweep her off her feet -.criminal background be damned. But as the focus of our attention shifts from the two unlikely lovers and onto the son who's observing and ultimately commenting on this bizarre situation, the movie deepens into an off-beat and thought-provoking look into the complexities of human nature and of familial relationships (Tobey Maguire provides the narration as the grown-up Henry and makes a brief appearance later in the movie).Winslet, Brolin and Griffith all give remarkable performances, as do Robert Clark Gregg and James Van Der Beek in supporting roles. Jason Reitman`s moody screenplay and muted direction achieve a dreamy, almost hallucinatory quality that transports the tale to the realm of allegory or fable, where credibility doesn`t play quite so crucial a role in our overall appreciation of it (a young girl`s noting the parallels between what`s happening here and the highly fictionalized and romanticized ""Bonnie and Clyde"" puts the theme into sharp focus).The movie constantly blurs the line between good and evil, and makes it clear that most things are never quite as clear or as black-and-white as people choose to believe they are, especially when it comes to affairs of the heart.It's a shame that after all this, the authors just couldn't resist tacking on a Lifetime Channel-like coda that indulges in all the dime-novel slickery and sentimentality that they've admirably managed to avoid for most of the movie up to that point.

I mean, I could have accepted in the novel if she'd called 911 but I just don't think many people would take a bleeding stranger home. I viewed the movie to see how the screenwriter would handle the story. the screenwriter did a better &#34;meet&#34; than the author did, but the Kate Winslet character still fell in love with him for no reason I could see. story just doesn't work for me. acting all around is fine. did not like the music.",2,"as written, this is a hard sell to educated women (spoilers)...",1400025600,"05 14, 2014",2014,1719,"['man', 'divorced', 'depressed', 'woman', 'pre-teen', 'son', 'who', 'live', 'small', 'town', 'store', 'forcing', 'take', 'home', 'arrival', 'charm', 'feeding', 'teaching', 'how', 'bake', 'pie', 'showing', 'son', 'how', 'throw', 'ball', 'change', 'tire', 'short', 'order', 'woman', 'love', 'even', 'being', 'escaped', 'convict', 'son', 'also', 'greatly', 'man.the', 'problem', 'stories', 'woman', 'reality', 'world', 'so', 'largely', 'misogynistic', 'simply', 'do', 'not', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'women', 'characters', 'violated', 'then', 'grow', 'love', 'violators', 'period', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'used', 'read', 'books', 'watch', 'movies', 'similar', 'themes', ""'ve"", 'long', 'grown', 'such', 'nonsense', 'nothing', 'man', 'did', 'kidnapping', 'pair', 'made', 'appealing', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'past', 'how', 'met.I', 'read', 'book', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'was', 'thought', 'how', 'writer', 'had', 'convict', 'enter', 'story', 'was', 'totally', 'unbelievable', 'book', 'author', 'had', 'bleeding', 'man', 'approach', 'son/mother', 'ask', 'help', 'gave', 'least', 'movie', 'kidnapped', 'was', 'more', 'believable', 'woman', 'child', 'agreeing', 'help', 'bleeding', 'male', 'stranger', 'store', 'giving', 'lift', 'mean', 'could', 'have', 'accepted', 'novel', ""'d"", 'called', '911', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'many', 'people', 'would', 'take', 'bleeding', 'stranger', 'home', 'viewed', 'movie', 'see', 'how', 'screenwriter', 'would', 'handle', 'story', 'screenwriter', 'did', 'better', '34', 'meet', '34', 'author', 'did', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'character', 'still', 'fell', 'love', 'reason', 'could', 'see', 'story', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'acting', 'around', 'fine', 'did', 'not', 'music']",Labor Day
1687923,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B00H9LHVHI,Steven Aldersley,"[25, 30]","I was apprehensive attending the Saturday morning showing of Jason Reitman's Labor Day. Although I almost always avoid reviews and trailers when I am certain I will see a movie, I had heard the mostly negative buzz for Reitman's fifth movie. I also knew that this wouldn't contain the humor that I loved in Thank You for Smoking, Juno, Up in the Air and Young Adult. In short, I was afraid that Reitman's perfect record would be broken, but in my mind at least, he's still batting a thousand. If you're a Reitman fan, I urge you to stop reading until you have seen the movie. It's impossible to talk about it without giving away significant plot points.For those of you who are undecided, I'm not going to mention anything that isn't revealed in the trailer.Adele (Kate Winslet) plays a single mother who lives with her son, Henry (Gattlin Griffith). Her former husband had a child with another woman and Adele struggles to cope with depression and social anxiety. She barely leaves the house, shopping just once a month for supplies from the local store. It might be difficult to understand this condition if you have never suffered from it. Some days are good, and it's possible to talk to a total stranger; other days are difficult, and the slightest trigger can result in a surge of panic. This fight or flight feeling can be overwhelming, and, as a coping technique, those who suffer from anxiety run through every possible scenario before facing the world.You can imagine Adele's horror when Henry introduces her to Frank (Josh Brolin), who just met him in the store and asked for a ride. I can imagine Adele wondering how to extract herself from the situation without upsetting her son. Does Frank look safe, or could he turn out to be dangerous? Frank more or less insists that Adele help him, and then demands to be driven to her home. He's an escaped convict.This is not the Reitman that we have come to know and love. Make no mistake, Labor Day is a drama. It plays out somewhat like a Hitchcock movie, but instead of seeing things from the viewpoint of the man on the run, we see things through the eyes of Adele and Henry. Frank just wants to rest for a while and says that he will leave that night by train, but Labor Day weekend is approaching and the trains aren't running.The story is set in 1987, and the narration is handled by Tobey Maguire, who also shows up later in the story as an adult version of Henry. If you're planning to see this movie because Maguire is involved, his role is fairly minor. This is all about the interaction between Adele and Frank, and how it impacts Henry. The acting is superb, and Winslet thoroughly deserved her Golden Globe nomination.As the trailer shows, this film isn't a traditional crime drama. Adele has missed her husband and Frank doesn't seem all that threatening. The news bulletins say that he is a murderer serving 18 years, but he insists that things didn't happen the way they were described on TV. We eventually learn the truth through flashbacks, but I won't talk about that here. We are also shown more of Adele's past, and come to understand some of the things that trigger her anxiety. These troubled people find that they like each other, and both Adele and Henry seem content to have Frank around. Instead of treating them as prisoners, he even fixes things around the house.I found myself actually rooting for Frank to escape and it reminded me of Roger Ebert's comments about the scene in Psycho where we wanted the car to sink into the water when Norman Bates was hiding it. I keep mentioning Hitchcock because tension and suspense is present throughout the film. I think I was engrossed in the story for every single moment of the 111 minutes.So why are the reviews so negative? Is the story unrealistic? Not to me. Is the ending contrived or weak? I certainly didn't think so. I was never bored and the resolution wasn't immediately obvious. The actors didn't put a foot wrong either. Were people disappointed by the lack of Reitman's established formula? I really don't know why the reviews are so bad. I can assure you that I would echo those opinions if the same were true for me, but I loved Labor Day. The score was subtle and effective, the pacing good, and the atmosphere just right.The only difficult thing is deciding whether to give the film 4.5 or 5 stars, and I think it deserves a 5. If you like Reitman at all, please give this a chance and make up your own mind. I'm delighted that I did.",5,Jason Reitman is still batting a thousand,1391299200,"02 2, 2014",2014,4482,"['was', 'apprehensive', 'attending', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'showing', 'Jason', 'Reitman', 'Labor', 'Day', 'almost', 'always', 'avoid', 'reviews', 'trailers', 'when', 'am', 'certain', 'will', 'see', 'movie', 'had', 'heard', 'mostly', 'negative', 'buzz', 'Reitman', 'fifth', 'movie', 'also', 'knew', 'would', ""n't"", 'contain', 'humor', 'loved', 'Thank', 'Smoking', 'Juno', 'Up', 'Air', 'Young', 'Adult', 'short', 'was', 'afraid', 'Reitman', 'perfect', 'record', 'would', 'be', 'broken', 'mind', 'least', 'still', 'batting', 'thousand', ""'re"", 'Reitman', 'fan', 'urge', 'stop', 'reading', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'impossible', 'talk', 'giving', 'away', 'significant', 'plot', 'points.For', 'who', 'are', 'undecided', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'mention', 'anything', ""n't"", 'revealed', 'trailer.Adele', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'single', 'mother', 'who', 'son', 'Henry', 'Gattlin', 'Griffith', 'former', 'husband', 'had', 'child', 'woman', 'Adele', 'cope', 'depression', 'social', 'anxiety', 'barely', 'house', 'shopping', 'just', 'once', 'month', 'supplies', 'local', 'store', 'might', 'be', 'difficult', 'understand', 'condition', 'have', 'never', 'suffered', 'days', 'are', 'good', 'possible', 'talk', 'total', 'stranger', 'other', 'days', 'are', 'difficult', 'slightest', 'trigger', 'can', 'result', 'surge', 'panic', 'fight', 'flight', 'feeling', 'can', 'be', 'overwhelming', 'coping', 'technique', 'who', 'suffer', 'anxiety', 'run', 'possible', 'scenario', 'facing', 'world.You', 'can', 'imagine', 'Adele', 'horror', 'when', 'Henry', 'Frank', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'who', 'just', 'met', 'store', 'asked', 'ride', 'can', 'imagine', 'Adele', 'wondering', 'how', 'extract', 'situation', 'upsetting', 'son', 'Does', 'Frank', 'look', 'safe', 'could', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'dangerous', 'Frank', 'more', 'less', 'insists', 'Adele', 'help', 'then', 'demands', 'be', 'driven', 'home', 'escaped', 'convict.This', 'not', 'Reitman', 'have', 'come', 'know', 'love', 'Make', 'mistake', 'Labor', 'Day', 'drama', 'out', 'somewhat', 'Hitchcock', 'movie', 'instead', 'seeing', 'things', 'viewpoint', 'man', 'run', 'see', 'things', 'eyes', 'Adele', 'Henry', 'Frank', 'just', 'rest', 'while', 'will', 'leave', 'night', 'train', 'Labor', 'Day', 'weekend', 'approaching', 'trains', 'are', ""n't"", 'running.The', 'story', 'set', '1987', 'narration', 'handled', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'who', 'also', 'up', 'later', 'story', 'adult', 'version', 'Henry', ""'re"", 'planning', 'see', 'movie', 'Maguire', 'involved', 'role', 'fairly', 'minor', 'interaction', 'Adele', 'Frank', 'how', 'Henry', 'acting', 'superb', 'Winslet', 'thoroughly', 'deserved', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'trailer', 'film', ""n't"", 'traditional', 'crime', 'drama', 'Adele', 'missed', 'husband', 'Frank', ""n't"", 'seem', 'threatening', 'news', 'bulletins', 'say', 'murderer', 'serving', '18', 'years', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'way', 'were', 'described', 'TV', 'eventually', 'learn', 'truth', 'flashbacks', 'wo', ""n't"", 'talk', 'here', 'are', 'also', 'shown', 'more', 'Adele', 'past', 'come', 'understand', 'things', 'trigger', 'anxiety', 'troubled', 'people', 'find', 'like', 'other', 'Adele', 'Henry', 'seem', 'content', 'have', 'Frank', 'Instead', 'treating', 'prisoners', 'even', 'fixes', 'things', 'house.I', 'found', 'actually', 'rooting', 'Frank', 'escape', 'reminded', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'comments', 'scene', 'Psycho', 'where', 'wanted', 'car', 'sink', 'water', 'when', 'Norman', 'Bates', 'was', 'hiding', 'keep', 'mentioning', 'Hitchcock', 'tension', 'suspense', 'present', 'film', 'think', 'was', 'engrossed', 'story', 'single', 'moment', '111', 'minutes.So', 'why', 'are', 'reviews', 'so', 'negative', 'story', 'unrealistic', 'Not', 'ending', 'contrived', 'weak', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'was', 'never', 'bored', 'resolution', 'was', ""n't"", 'immediately', 'obvious', 'actors', 'did', ""n't"", 'put', 'foot', 'wrong', 'either', 'Were', 'people', 'disappointed', 'lack', 'Reitman', 'established', 'formula', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'reviews', 'are', 'so', 'bad', 'can', 'assure', 'would', 'echo', 'opinions', 'same', 'were', 'true', 'loved', 'Labor', 'Day', 'score', 'was', 'subtle', 'effective', 'pacing', 'good', 'atmosphere', 'just', 'only', 'difficult', 'thing', 'deciding', 'give', 'film', '4.5', '5', 'stars', 'think', '5', 'like', 'Reitman', 'please', 'give', 'chance', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'mind', ""'m"", 'delighted', 'did']",Labor Day
1687924,A3JDK2RUAXXK3P,B00H9LHVHI,Steverino,"[0, 0]","I so rarely enjoy new movies. There is very little to appreciate about most of the (rehashed) fare that's out there these days. However, Jason Reitman's directing drew me to this story. How wrong can you go with a director that gave us Juno or Up In The Air? The two lead characters are played with skill by Winslet and Brolin. The part of the young boy, Henry, was played with skill as well. The thing that really stood out (as another reviewer pointed out) was that this was much more of a heavy DRAMA than Reitman's other pieces, but the MOOD and the music surrounding this story were PERFECT. Although the plot is fairly simple and straightforward, you really end up believing that this could really happen, in a real-life situation.

Its about this a criminal that jumps from a hospital window to get away. He comes across a boy and his mom. He has them drive him to their home. There he see that in the back of their house is railroad tracks. So he decides that he will leave by train, but the train doesn't run that weekend, because its a holiday(which of course is Labor Day weekend). So in return for staying there he works on her car, makes repairs on her house, cleans, cooks and teaches her son how to play baseball. He turned out to be very gentle with her and her son. Before the weekend was over the mom was falling in love with him and she was starting to relax around him. He also was falling for her. They both decided that they all were going to Canada to live and they had all the things in the house packed and the house cleaned. Then she went into town to withdraw all her money from the bank and while she was gone her friend walked in and saw him. The friend knew who he was and called the police. He then tied them both up so that they wouldn't so that the police would think that he made the do it. Weeks after that she went to tried to tell them that he wasn't a killer and he was kind to them. She ended up sending her son to live with his dad only until his dad started to make some nasty remarks about his mom, then he went back to leave with her. When he got older he got married and started his own pie shop. Josh showed them how to make the best pies so he used that for making pies for his shop and it became a big hit. Then Josh wrote a letter to him telling him that he was going to be released soon. When he did get release, his mom was there waiting for him. She still loved him.

Sure, Labor Day has a great pedigree, with actors Kate Winslet and Josh Brolin, plus director Jason Reitman, the new Hollywood wunderkind who gave us Juno and Up in the Air.  But the schmaltzy ad campaign gave Labor Day all of the appeal of a typical bodice ripper paperback, a Harlequin Romance up on the big screen, and it just seemed a little, well, desperate, with the lead actors solemnly giving all of reasons that I should hurry and see their movie.  Hurry and see it before all of the reviews come out, it read in captions only I could see.But I wasn't a football fan, so on Superbowl Sunday I took my Mom along, and since there was nothing remotely appropriate for a 78 year old women (her, not me) I bought tickets at a virtually empty multi-plex, and settled down for what I hoped was a tolerable few hours.Labor Day begins when Adele (the always captivating Kate Winslet) shows us with just a few gestures that she is not a happy woman, afraid to drive her car out of the driveway with her 13 year old son in tow to make her monthly trip to the local market.  Tobey Maguire, who should put ""professional voice-over artist"" on his resume, provides the grown-up narrative voice of son Henry, played as a boy by (him of the very cool name) Gattlin Griffith, who confirms Adele's on-going depression, along with the information that she had been left by her husband, his father, and had grown steadily sadder since.  Henry gives up a much sunnier life with his father and new wife and kids to become his mother's keeper, watching her constantly, helping, correcting and gently guiding his trembling and troubled mom through life.When their marketing trip is disturbed by a menacing, bleeding man in the store (Josh Brolin), the two find themselves kidnapped at knifepoint by him.  The man forces Adele to take him to her home, so that he can ""lay low"" until night, after which he will leave them as he found them.  Adele and Henry are suitably frightened and upset, especially when the man, Frank Chambers, ties Adele to a chair, with the ""I'm a nice guy caveat"" that she will now be able to honestly tell police she had been kidnapped (as if she would do anything else after a kidnapping). We learn from a variety of sources, television, neighbours, cops, that Frank is an escaped convict, a murderer no less.  The information doesn't make Adele and Henry relax much, but true love, with a generous slathering of sexy romance thrown in, can make bedfellows of the strangest people.And so Frank begins to charm the pair, with chili making, handyman duties and fatherly hair mussing and baseball advise given to Henry, as starved for this kind of affection as his mother is starved for love. The now almost famous peach pie making scene is so sexual it verges on incestuous. Enough said.  The movie is now set up, with Frank, the escaped prisoner who murdered his wife (even though we learn through the muddled flashbacks that she pretty much deserved it), appearing just in time to save Adele from her loveless and lonely state and provide Henry with the kind of father figure a boy needs.  Over a long weekend, the sad  pair become a hopeful trio, eventually determined to make a run for it together to Canada to begin a new life.  The police and neighbors ominously turn up once in awhile, adding tension and excitement...Will they be caught, or will they make it, as they so obviously deserve to do?Jason Reitman has been accused by practically everyone of copying Nicholas Sparks with this adaptation of Joyce Maynards novel, from the wistful but worthy characters to the hopeless (but oh-so-sentimental) story.  I'm going to go out on a limb and disagree.  Despite the sappy story, I thought Labor Day was very good, much better than the afore mentioned Sparks films.  The acting of the three main characters (Winslet, Brolin and Griffith) is terrific, Winslet leading the pack with her damaged but deserving-of-love characterization of Adele. While the plot is a little, well, silly (Stockholm Syndrome, anyone?) I found myself completely invested as I watched Labor Day, close to (but not quite at) the edge of my seat, really, really hoping that the new family would make it, despite snooping policemen and nosy neighbors.  Spoiler alert (don't read if you don't want to know how it all turns out).  The ending seemed a bit tacked on, as if a test audience had given the original (not very happy) ending a thumbs down and the studio had insisted on a lighter, happier and definitely more satisfying finale.  But satisfying it is, and who can argue with that?I gave Labor Day four stars, but I admit that I wobbled between three and four stars when I wrote this review.  The four stars are there because, despite all of the nasty and negative Labor Day reviews floating around cyberspace, I very much liked this movie.  It was engaging, suspenseful and, I thought, hopeful.  A love story that, for me at least, touched my heart and my mind.  So, four stars. No wait...three. Oh what the heck, I really liked it.  Four stars.By the way, my Mother hated it.",4,Surprise...I Really Liked Labor Day,1391385600,"02 3, 2014",2014,5181,"['did', ""n't"", 'run', 'theater', 'catch', 'movie', 'mountain', 'marketing',

What starts off as a way to escape the law also becomes a way for Adele to escape her life and find the one thing she has been missing. So first of all I have to say this is a good movie. That said this is geared way more toward women then I was expecting. It's hard for me to totally get into movies like this mainly because they are so unbelievable. I don't want to give anything away but if you have seen any Nicholas Sparks movie you will know what to expect. I couldn't get past the &#34;perfect man&#34; aspect of this. Within a day of showing up at the house the convicted murderer fixes her car, makes dinner and a pie, teaches her son to throw a baseball and allows the paraplegic kid from next door to join in...on the first day! You can pretty much guess how the movie turns out from there. As a heads up this is the most uplifting and inspiring Kate Winslet movie since Revolutionary Road so be prepared for that. This isn't bad but my wife liked this much more then I did. Overall, if you like movies like The Lucky One you will love this. I give it a B but again my wife liked it much more then I did.",3,"If you've seen any Nicholas Sparks movie you will know what to expect.

Though the film is beautifully shot, well-acted (with Golden Globe nominated Winslet), and meticulously detailed, there is something implausible about the story that is too sweet and sentimental.Set in summer, 1987, &#8220;Labor Day&#8221; follows the story of a 13-year-old boy Henry (Gattlin Griffith) and his depressed mother Adele (Kate Winslet). While shopping, they are approached by a grim-looking stranger Frank, who &#8220;asks&#8221; them to give him a lift. Unable to resist, Adele and Henry take him to their home, where it is revealed that Frank is an escaped convict.What follows is a love story seen from a young boy&#8217;s viewpoint. Frank also becomes a sort of surrogate father to Henry. The film has too much voiceover, with too little progress in the storyline, though the two leading players Brolin and Winslet provide genuine emotions. &#8220;Labor Day&#8221; is a decent drama with strong performances that barely cover up the weakness in the story.",3,"Love Stroy from the Director of ""Up in the Air"" and ""Juno""",1400457600,"05 19, 2014",2014,1358,"['8220', 'Labor', 'Day', '8221', 'latest', 'effort', 'acclaimed', 'director', 'Jason', 'Reitman', 'known', 'such', 'works', '8220', 'Thank', 'Smoking', '8221', '8220', 'Juno', '8221', '8220', 'Up', 'Air.', '8221', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'wit', 'satire', 'will', 'be', 'surprised', 'melodramatic', 'story', '8220', 'Labor', 'Day', '8221', 'unlikely', 'pair', 'lovers', 'played', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'film', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'well-acted', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'nominated', 'Winslet', 'meticulously', 'detailed', 'something', 'implausible', 'story', 'too', 'sweet', 'sentimental.Set', 'summer', '1987', '8220', 'Labor', 'Day', '8221', 'story', '13-year-old', 'boy', 'Henry', 'Gattlin', 'Griffith', 'depressed', 'mother', 'Adele', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'shopping', 'are', 'approached', 'grim-looking', 'stranger', 'Frank', 'who', '8220', '8221', 'give', 'lift', 'Unable', 'resist', 'Adele', 'Henry', 'take', 'home', 'where', 'revealed', 'Frank', 'escaped', 'convict.What', 'love', 'story', 'seen', 'young', 'boy', '8217', 's', 'viewpoint', 'Frank', 'also', 'sort', 'surrogate', 'father', 'Henry', 'film', 'too', 'much', 'voiceover', 'too', 'little', 'progress', 'storyline', 'two', 'leading', 'players', 'Brolin', 'Winslet', 'provide', 'genuine', 'emotions', '8220', 'Labor', 'Day', '8221', 'decent', 'drama', 'strong', 'performances', 'barely', 'cover', 'up', 'weakness', 'story']",Labor Day
