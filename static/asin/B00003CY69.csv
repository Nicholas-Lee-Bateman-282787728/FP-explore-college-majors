I couldn't quite make up my mind if the cast were just incompetent, or the script was letting them down very badly. Probably both. Some of Helen Hunt's lines fell so flat I cringed for her. The interaction between her and Woody was possibly the least convincing bit of acting I've seen in a long time. I'm amazed he dare release it.Worse, the plot is utterly peurile and full of holes you could drive a truck through.

543722,A1PASRZ81DY9C,B00003CY69,Austin Somlo,"[1, 13]","Viewed: 1/08Rate: 21/08: It takes a great courage to watch a Woody Allen film, and I mustered all possible courage before seeing The Curse of the Jade Scorpion. Once again, it was a hefty chore for me, and The Curse of the Jade Scorpion is purely a Woody Allen flick. There is a lot of talk and talk and talk that seemed to have me longing for a nap. Predictability is tedious, and The Curse of the Jade Scorpion committed a crime of that. Sure, there is a twist in the film, but, somewhere in my mind, I've seen this concept before. The cast is not bad, and they couldn't do very much except being stuck with the blandness of it all. Somehow, The Curse of the Jade Scorpion is an excuse for Woody Allen to get his cheating ways with women, as he does with Charlize Theron and Helen Hunt. Disappointing, ain't it? Speaking of disappointment, I actually wanted Woody Allen's character to be imprisoned for his crimes and be sentenced to death for stealing jewels. That way, I can have a satisfying movie experience out of The Curse of the Jade Scorpion. Speaking of prison sentences, wasn't he supposed to get one for statutory rape? I will have to watch Chinatown to wash this stink off my mind, and I was surprised that The Curse of the Jade Scorpion was advertised as a comedy. I wasn't sure where that came from.",1,"I Hate Woody Allen So Much, and I Hate His Movies So Much.",1290902400,"11 28, 2010",2010,1315,"['Viewed', '1/08Rate', '21/08', 'great', 'courage', 'watch', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'film', 'mustered', 'possible', 'courage', 'seeing', 'Curse', 'Jade', 'Scorpion', 'Once', 'again', 'was', 'hefty', 'chore', 'Curse', 'Jade', 'Scorpion', 'purely', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'flick', 'lot', 'talk', 'talk', 'talk', 'seemed', 'have', 'longing', 'nap', 'Predictability', 'tedious', 'Curse', 'Jade', 'Scorpion', 'committed', 'crime', 'Sure', 'twist', 'film', 'somewhere', 'mind', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'concept', 'before', 'cast', 'not', 'bad', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'very', 'much', 'being', 'stuck', 'blandness', 'Somehow', 'Curse', 'Jade', 'Scorpion', 'excuse', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'get', 'cheating', 'ways', 'women', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'Disappointing', 'ai', ""n't"", 'Speaking', 'disappointment', 'actually', 'wanted', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'character', 'be', 'imprisoned', 'crimes', 'be', 'sentenced', 'death', 'stealing', 'jewels', 'way', 'can', 'have', 'satisfying', 'movie', 'experience', 'Curse', 'Jade', 'Scorpion', 'Speaking', 'prison', 'sentences', 'was', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'get', 'one', 'statutory', 'rape', 'will', 'have', 'watch', 'Chinatown', 'wash', 'stink', 'mind', 'was', 'surprised', 'Curse', 'Jade', 'Scorpion', 'was', 'advertised', 'comedy', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'where', 'came']",The Curse of the Jade Scorpion VHS

Gordon ""IntoFilms""","[5, 5]","I feel cheated... all these years I never bothered with this film over all the negativity surrounding it - including Woody Allen himself, who considers it his worst film. However, I genuinely found this story hilarious, and the chemistry of the cast was perfect for my taste. As a comic farce, I found it fast-paced and quirky with lots of zippy one-liners, and contrary to all the critics who hate this film, I was genuinely entertained with its flashes of original brilliance. Allen once said he felt like he let the cast down by putting himself in the lead, but how could anyone else play it? He's perfect. The pace of the movie reminded me of Allen's much older (and better) outings. Even the '40's soundtrack with some great snippets of his favorite ragtime throughout is very tastefully executed. I watched this on Netflix for free, but have since purchased it as a movie I want in my collection.

543724,A3MPEDYM4DGS5O,B00003CY69,BigSPEEGS,"[3, 4]","I picked up a promotional pamphlet for Woody Allen's &quot;The Curse of the Jade Scorpion&quot; the other day. It outlines the various steps one must take to hypnotize another, and at the bottom it says: &quot;For entertainment only. Try at your own risk&quot;. Isn't it interesting how that statement nicely echoes the wonderful time Woody Allen gives in his new film. Don't go in expecting a masterpiece (this isnt an &quot;Annie Hall&quot; or &quot;Everyone Says I Love You&quot;) but Curse is a gem compared to all of the schlock this summer has offered.Woody Allen is CW Briggs, one of the best insurance investigators in the business. A new efficiency expert Betty Ann Fitzgerald (Helen Hunt) joins the company, and she drives CW up the wall. She is also having an affair with Chris Magruder (Dan Aykroyd), head of the insurance company. One night, in a club celebrating a company birthday, a master hypnotist (David Ogden Stiers) puts them both into a spell that leaves them to do everything he wishes. Lunacy begins as he commands them to rob estate after estate, putting them both on the line.&quot;The Curse of the Jade Scorpion&quot; is Allen's tip of the hat to such enduring 1940s classics such as &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; and &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;. The dialogue in &quot;Scorpion&quot; doesnt come close to the zesty sharpness of films like &quot;Indemnity&quot;, but the banter between Allen and Hunt is a pleasure to watch. The only critique I have of these hilarious arguments is that in their closing, Helen Hunt always seems to be clinging to that last punchline, as if she's asking Allen &quot;did you get that?&quot;One thing Woody Allen has always good taste in was music for his movies. Every time hypnotist Volar rings in to say the magic words (Constantinople for Allen, Madagascar for Hunt) the music kicks into full swing (pun intended). The music matches the mood and feel of the film so perfectly that its a wonder no soundtrack has been released.The performances arent outstanding, but they fit snugly into their roles. Allen, who is perfect for the role because he writes for himself, leads the pack. He is very good, and signs of him slowing down or dulling are nowhere to be seen. Hunt also does a good job, even though she seems half-asleep during some scenes. Dan Akroyd also provides abundant support as Betty Ann's lover. But it is Charlize Theron, impeccable as Laura Kensington, who brings back memories of the 40s more than anyone else in the cast.&quot;The Curse of the Jade Scorpion&quot; is not a new Woody Allen classic, but it is without a doubt one of the best (Hollywood) comedies I've seen all summer. Allen sticks to familiar territory, but it's still so much funnier than most everything else out right now. I recommend this delightful movie without reservation.",4,"Oh, just sit back and ENJOY yourself",1022889600,"06 1, 2002",2002,2825,"['picked', 'up', 'promotional', 'pamphlet', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'quot', 'Curse', 'Jade', 'Scorpion', 'quot', 'other', 'day', 'various', 'steps', 'one', 'must', 'take', 'hypnotize', 'bottom', 'quot', 'entertainment', 'only', 'Try', 'own', 'risk', 'quot', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'how', 'statement', 'nicely', 'wonderful', 'time', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'new', 'film', 'Do', ""n't"", 'go', 'expecting', 'masterpiece', 'quot', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'quot', 'quot', 'Everyone', 'Love', 'quot', 'Curse', 'gem', 'compared', 'schlock', 'summer', 'offered.Woody', 'Allen', 'CW', 'Briggs', 'one', 'best', 'insurance', 'investigators', 'business', 'new', 'efficiency', 'expert', 'Betty', 'Ann', 'Fitzgerald', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'company', 'CW', 'up', 'wall', 'also', 'having', 'affair', 'Chris', 'Magruder', 'Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'head', 'insurance', 'company', 'One', 'night', 'club', 'celebrating', 'company', 'birthday', 'master', 'hypnotist', 'David', 'Ogden', 'Stiers', 'spell', 'do', 'everything', 'Lunacy', 'rob', 'estate', 'estate', 'putting', 'line.', 'quot', 'Curse', 'Jade', 'Scorpion', 'quot', 'Allen', 'tip', 'hat', 'such', 'enduring', '1940s', 'classics', 'such', 'quot', 'Double', 'Indemnity', 'quot', 'quot', 'Maltese', 'Falcon', 'quot', 'dialogue', 'quot', 'Scorpion', 'quot', 'come', 'close', 'zesty', 'sharpness', 'films', 'quot', 'Indemnity', 'quot', 'banter', 'Allen', 'Hunt', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'only', 'critique', 'have', 'hilarious', 'arguments', 'closing', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'always', 'be', 'clinging', 'last', 'punchline', 'asking', 'Allen', 'quot', 'did', 'get', 'quot', 'One', 'thing', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'always', 'good', 'taste', 'was', 'music', 'movies', 'time', 'hypnotist', 'Volar', 'rings', 'say', 'magic', 'words', 'Constantinople', 'Allen', 'Madagascar', 'Hunt', 'music', 'full', 'swing', 'pun', 'intended', 'music', 'mood', 'feel', 'film', 'so', 'perfectly', 'wonder', 'soundtrack', 'been', 'released.The', 'performances', 'arent', 'outstanding', 'fit', 'snugly', 'roles', 'Allen', 'who', 'perfect', 'role', 'pack', 'very', 'good', 'signs', 'slowing', 'down', 'dulling', 'are', 'nowhere', 'be', 'seen', 'Hunt', 'also', 'good', 'job', 'even', 'half-asleep', 'scenes', 'Dan', 'Akroyd', 'also', 'abundant', 'support', 'Betty', 'Ann', 'lover', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'impeccable', 'Laura', 'Kensington', 'who', 'back', 'memories', '40s', 'more', 'anyone', 'else', 'cast.', 'quot', 'Curse', 'Jade', 'Scorpion', 'quot', 'not', 'new', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'classic', 'doubt', 'one', 'best', 'Hollywood', 'comedies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'summer', 'Allen', 'sticks', 'familiar', 'territory', 'still', 'so', 'much', 'funnier', 'most', 'everything', 'else', 'out', 'right', 'now', 'recommend', 'delightful', 'movie', 'reservation']",The Curse of the Jade Scorpion VHS
543725,A20IIR0422G3A5,B00003CY69,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[2, 3]","`The Curse of the Jade Scorpion' is a standard Woody Allen comedy homage / satire of an historical dramatic / film genre, in the same way that `Shadows and Fog' was a take-off on 1930s German expressionism and `A Mid-Summer's Night Sex Comedy' was a takeoff on Shakespeare's `A Mid-Summer's Night Dream'. The movie is also `standard' Woody in that many of Allen's stock company of actors and production team are working on the film, including Wallace Shawn and David Ogden Stiers. The lead actors Dan Aykroyd, Helen Hunt, and Charlize Theron are all working with Allen for the first time, but as Aykroyd says in the notes, not for want of trying. The stock quote from actors in an Allen film when they talk about getting the call to work with Woody is that they never have to be asked twice.The movie parodies a 1940's whodunit that would have been a perfect vehicle for Humphrey Bogart in the Allen role of insurance investigator and Lauren Bacall in the roll of daughter of a wealthy burglary victim, played in this movie by Charlize Theron. Both castings are the basis of two of the more prominent humorous situations. Seeing nebbish Woody playing a role typically performed by Bogart or James Cagney or John Garfield or Edgar G. Robinson is the biggest running gag of the film. One evocation of this gag is when Allen finds himself entering an erotic encounter with the very luscious Theron. The reason the encounter is not consummated is part of the underlying story line, so I cannot say much more without giving away the heart of the movie. The joke is in how this circumstance can detour Allen from bedding Theron. Aside from this episode, Theron's appearance in the movie is poorly used. The only excuse may be that this appearance was still a good two years before Theron's Academy Award for `Monster', so she was not even at the same level of star power as costars Aykroyd and Hunt.Aykroyd and Hunt, especially Hunt, are at the heart of the story line. Aykroyd is the boss at the insurance company at which Allen's character has worked as the head loss investigator for many years. Allen's character has been very successful at this job, largely through a talented intuition and a network of informers. Hunt is a newly hired efficiency expert charged with improving the profitability of the company. In this role, she immediately clashes with Allen's old time testosterone stereotype who views Hunt in much the same light as he sees the luscious office girls. This clash, leading to Hunt's hiring an outside detective agency to investigate two very similar burglaries, is the main foreground action, sharing the stage with the love affair between Hunt and Aykroyd.One thing I always like about Allen films is that once you buy into his basic premise or setting for the movie, his presentation of human nature is generally quite accurate, contrary to implausible behavior in many other comedies, not to mention plainly impossible premises based on miracle changes in age or body switching. In this film, Allen's character is quite competent at his job and his colleagues stand by him even when evidence connecting him to the burglaries mounts, gathered by the outside agency. We are dealing with stereotypes here, but they are realistic stereotypes.As always, Allen has a roster of stars behind the camera as well as in front of it. One of his greatest strengths seems be in building a strong team that historically always brings his films in on schedule and within budget, with a critical if not a popularly successful movie. Allen's studios have probably gotten into the habit of expecting him to create movies produced for 20 million and netting 25 million. Money in the bank, for sure.As Allen movies go, this is not his best comedy, and it is certainly not his worst. It has a happy ending with none of the angst of `Manhattan' and none of the pathos of `The Purple Rose of Cairo'. It is the kind of movie that can be enjoyed by people who are not confirmed Woodman fans. Up to this point, DVDs of Allen films generally do not have a lot of special features. All the usual subtitle, trailer, and biographic extras are there, but nothing else. I really have no problem with this, as I would much rather see Allen spend his time on his next movie rather than spicing up the extras on a good movie which can stand on its own very well, thank you.Recommended to anyone who likes intelligent comedies. Especially recommended to Woody Allen fans.",4,"Standard, Entertaining Woodman Work.",1092787200,"08 18, 2004",2004,4455,"['Curse', 'Jade', 'Scorpion', 'standard', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'comedy', 'homage', '/', 'satire', 'historical', 'dramatic', '/', 'film', 'genre', 'same', 'way', 'Shadows', 'Fog', 'was', 'take-off', '1930s', 'German', 'expressionism', 'Mid-Summer', 'Night', 'Sex', 'Comedy', 'was', 'takeoff', 'Shakespeare', 'Mid-Summer', 'Night', 'Dream', 'movie', 'also', 'standard', 'Woody', 'many', 'Allen', 'stock', 'company', 'actors', 'production', 'team', 'are', 'working', 'film', 'including', 'Wallace', 'Shawn', 'David', 'Ogden', 'Stiers', 'lead', 'actors', 'Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'are', 'working', 'Allen', 'first', 'time', 'Aykroyd', 'notes', 'not', 'want', 'trying', 'stock', 'quote', 'actors', 'Allen', 'film', 'when', 'talk', 'getting', 'call', 'work', 'Woody', 'never', 'have', 'be', 'asked', 'twice.The', 'movie', '1940', 'whodunit', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'perfect', 'vehicle', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'Allen', 'role', 'insurance', 'investigator', 'Lauren', 'Bacall', 'roll', 'daughter', 'wealthy', 'burglary', 'victim', 'played', 'movie', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'castings', 'are', 'basis', 'two', 'more', 'prominent', 'humorous', 'situations', 'Seeing', 'nebbish', 'Woody', 'playing', 'role', 'typically', 'performed', 'Bogart', 'James', 'Cagney', 'John', 'Garfield', 'Edgar', 'G.', 'Robinson', 'biggest', 'running', 'gag', 'film', 'One', 'evocation', 'gag', 'when', 'Allen', 'entering', 'erotic', 'encounter', 'very', 'luscious', 'Theron', 'reason', 'encounter', 'not', 'consummated', 'part', 'underlying', 'story', 'line', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'much', 'more', 'giving', 'away', 'heart', 'movie', 'joke', 'how', 'circumstance', 'can', 'detour', 'Allen', 'bedding', 'Theron', 'Aside', 'episode', 'Theron', 'appearance', 'movie', 'poorly', 'used', 'only', 'excuse', 'may', 'be', 'appearance', 'was', 'still', 'good', 'two', 'years', 'Theron', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Monster', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'same', 'level', 'star', 'power', 'costars', 'Aykroyd', 'Hunt.Aykroyd', 'Hunt', 'especially', 'Hunt', 'are', 'heart', 'story', 'line', 'Aykroyd', 'boss', 'insurance', 'company', 'Allen', 'character', 'worked', 'head', 'loss', 'investigator', 'many', 'years', 'Allen', 'character', 'been', 'very', 'successful', 'job', 'largely', 'talented', 'intuition', 'network', 'informers', 'Hunt', 'newly', 'hired', 'efficiency', 'expert', 'charged', 'improving', 'profitability', 'company', 'role', 'immediately', 'Allen', 'old', 'time', 'testosterone', 'stereotype', 'who', 'Hunt', 'much', 'same', 'light', 'luscious', 'office', 'girls', 'clash', 'leading', 'Hunt', 'hiring', 'outside', 'detective', 'agency', 'investigate', 'two', 'very', 'similar', 'burglaries', 'main', 'foreground', 'action', 'sharing', 'stage', 'love', 'affair', 'Hunt', 'Aykroyd.One', 'thing', 'always', 'like', 'Allen', 'films', 'once', 'buy', 'basic', 'premise', 'setting', 'movie', 'presentation', 'human', 'nature', 'generally', 'quite', 'accurate', 'contrary', 'implausible', 'behavior', 'many', 'other', 'comedies', 'not', 'mention', 'plainly', 'impossible', 'premises', 'based', 'miracle', 'changes', 'age', 'body', 'switching', 'film', 'Allen', 'character', 'quite', 'competent', 'job', 'colleagues', 'stand', 'even', 'when', 'evidence', 'connecting', 'burglaries', 'mounts', 'gathered', 'outside', 'agency', 'are', 'dealing', 'stereotypes', 'here', 'are', 'realistic', 'stereotypes.As', 'always', 'Allen', 'roster', 'stars', 'camera', 'as', 'well', 'front', 'One', 'greatest', 'strengths', 'be', 'building', 'strong', 'team', 'historically', 'always', 'films', 'schedule', 'budget', 'critical', 'not', 'popularly', 'successful', 'movie', 'Allen', 'studios', 'have', 'probably', 'gotten', 'habit', 'expecting', 'create', 'movies', 'produced', '20', 'million', 'netting', '25', 'million', 'Money', 'bank', 'sure.As', 'Allen', 'movies', 'go', 'not', 'best', 'comedy', 'certainly', 'not', 'worst', 'happy', 'ending', 'none', 'angst', 'Manhattan', 'none', 'pathos', 'Purple', 'Rose', 'Cairo', 'kind', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'confirmed', 'Woodman', 'fans', 'Up', 'point', 'DVDs', 'Allen', 'films', 'generally', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'lot', 'special', 'features', 'usual', 'subtitle', 'trailer', 'biographic', 'extras', 'are', 'there', 'nothing', 'else', 'really', 'have', 'problem', 'would', 'much', 'rather', 'see', 'Allen', 'spend', 'time', 'next', 'movie', 'rather', 'spicing', 'up', 'extras', 'good', 'movie', 'can', 'stand', 'own', 'very', 'well', 'thank', 'you.Recommended', 'anyone', 'who', 'intelligent', 'comedies', 'Especially', 'recommended', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'fans']",The Curse of the Jade Scorpion VHS

However, it is a solid comedy with a crime drama that will keep you entertained some evening.Woody stars as an insurance investigator who is hypnotized to steal the very valuables for which he has set up impregnable security.During the course of the story, sparks fly in a bad way, including many amusing insults both ways, between his character and a woman hired to make the firm more efficient.Of course, misunderstandings and mysterious behaviors abound, and most of it is funny. It isn't a laugh riot, but if you're paying attention you'll hear many amusing lines that are often almost throw aways.This is plotted in the style of a 30s/40s comedy/mystery, and I could very much see Bob Hope or Danny Kaye in Woody's role here. In fact, the movie would have been a lot better with Bob Hope or Danny Kaye in the role ... at least from their younger days. Woody's funny asides, well, aside, he could have done a lot better in the casting of the lead role than himself. It isn't a role that would have fit his younger image, and his older screen image wasn't a good fit either.Still, there is a lot worse that you could be watching, and The Curse of the Jade Scorpion does have some truly amusing moments.",4,Late Woody Allen,1298764800,"02 27, 2011",2011,1330,"[""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'pretend', 'film', 'great', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'none', 'zaniness', 'irreverence', 'early', 'films', 'However', 'solid', 'comedy', 'crime', 'drama', 'will', 'keep', 'entertained', 'evening.Woody', 'insurance', 'investigator', 'who', 'hypnotized', 'steal', 'very', 'valuables', 'set', 'up', 'impregnable', 'security.During', 'course', 'story', 'fly', 'bad', 'way', 'including', 'many', 'amusing', 'insults', 'ways', 'character', 'woman', 'hired', 'make', 'firm', 'more', 'efficient.Of', 'course', 'misunderstandings', 'mysterious', 'behaviors', 'abound', 'most', 'funny', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'riot', ""'re"", 'paying', 'attention', ""'ll"", 'hear', 'many', 'amusing', 'lines', 'are', 'often', 'almost', 'throw', 'aways.This', 'plotted', 'style', '30s/40s', 'comedy/mystery', 'could', 'very', 'much', 'see', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'Danny', 'Kaye', 'Woody', 'role', 'here', 'fact', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'Danny', 'Kaye', 'role', 'least', 'younger', 'days', 'Woody', 'funny', 'asides', 'well', 'aside', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'lot', 'better', 'casting', 'lead', 'role', ""n't"", 'role', 'would', 'have', 'fit', 'younger', 'image', 'older', 'screen', 'image', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'fit', 'either.Still', 'lot', 'worse', 'could', 'be', 'watching', 'Curse', 'Jade', 'Scorpion', 'have', 'truly', 'amusing', 'moments']",The Curse of the Jade Scorpion VHS
543727,A3BVRA2QL3TIOQ,B00003CY69,carl womack,"[4, 6]","I never really was much of a Woody Allen fan, at least until I seen this movie. And I can't tell you if there have been any more scenes added on in the dvd version. I don't know. What I do know is this is a terrific film. It's a comedy, and a darn good one. Unlike a lot of today's comedy movies where the writers feel they must include tons of curse words, sex, and loads of yelling just to try and make the picture more appealing, this one has perfect dialologue that is both witty and inventive. This is a movie you can watch and get a good laugh, without wearing you out. It has action, but in a perfectly timed way. And I don't care if whether or not the movie grossed monkey one, It's good. It's the story of an insurance investigator (played by Allen) who, along with one of his associates (helen hunt) are hypnotized at a club as part of the evening enterainment. Only thing is, the magician has more sinister motives for their hypnotism. What are they? As usual, I'm not going to tell you. What I will say is that when certain words are said over a late night telephone call, Allen becomes a different person, and seeks to carry out the bidding of his ""Master"". This is by far one of the best movies I have seen in quite a while. I seen it on a premium channel today, and today I am ordered it from Amazon. I want to see this movie again, and again, and again. The one thing I did not like about this movie was the banjo playing during the ""action"" scenes, but since this was this was set in the 1940's, it really wouldn't feel right to have electric guitars played by AC/DC to set the mood.

I've been his hugest fan for decades, even applauding movies that he got roundly panned for, such as ""Deconstructing Harry.""  However, he has never made a film this bad and the #1 problem it has is having HIM as its romantic leading man.  He's trying to be Cary Grant in ""His Girl Friday"" with Helen Hunt as Rosalind Russell.  Or make that Spencer Tracey in the Tracey-Hepburn comedies. He is totally unconvincing as a romantic lead.  He plays a lead insurance investigator in the 1940s who is constantly at odds with his boss's girlfriend, Hunt.  They are both hynotized by a magician, who begins using them for jewel thefts by triggering their hypnotic states anew.  Allen is pathetic as this leading man.  Since his casting of himself is all off, his humor falls flat throughout as well when he delivers his zingers to Hunt. Incredibly, he makes himself a man lusted after by no less than 3 top drawer women in their primes.  To make matters worse, he also rehashes earlier, better scripts of his with this one.  He combines here ""Manhattan Murder Mystery,"" ""New York Stories,"" ""Everyone Says I Love You,"" with ""Radio Days.""  ""Scorpion,"" however, lacks the sparkle of Diane Keaton (MMM), the sheer original storytelling of NYS, the knock 'em dead musical sequences of ESILY and the warm heartedness and love of RD. I think if Allen wants to play a scathing role as he did in ""Deconstructing Harry,"" then he should continue to put himself in front of the camera.  For leading man roles, however, he needs to stay behind the camera and hire Sean Pean ""Sweet and Lowdown"" or John Cusack ""Bullets Over Broadway"" or Kenneth Branagh ""Celebrity"" to play those roles instead.

543729,A3OEECMCM2T4KQ,B00003CY69,C. Middleton,"[3, 5]","~The Curse of the Jade Scorpion~ is a welcome addition to an inspiring body of work that spans over twenty years. This film is hilarious. A friend once commented to me that you either love or hate Woody Allen and through the years I've found this to be true. To be honest, I've lost a few potentially meaningful relationships through taking them to a Woody Allen movie. On the other hand, I've shared some great laughs with a few dates as well, which have turned into fond memories. This film doesn't take itself too seriously and is designed to simply entertain. And entertain it certainly does...This film is a period satire on 40's film noir and a parody on romance. Allen plays C.W. Briggs, an insurance investigator who more often than not, either through luck or default, always gets his man. A new efficiency expert joins the firm, Betty Ann Fitzgerald, (Helen Hunt) and literally despises C.W. because he finds 'smart broads' threatening - in fact they hate each other - which is a perfect recipe for some witty insults both ways. The story unfolds when the company gets together for a work function and an evil showman hypnotizes them to fall in love. Through hypnotic suggestion, the villain also programs them to commit a few jewel heists - it is from here that the plot grows and gets very funny.Helen Hunt puts in a great comedic performance and achieved a believable and hilarious chemistry with Allen. Their non-stop staccato exchange of insults keeps you paying attention to catch every word. Charlize Theron's Bacall impersonation as the sexy siren is a pleasure to watch in more ways than one. Although Dan Ackroyd did a fine job as the adulterous boss, Allen did not take advantage of his comedic talents, however, this was the only disappointment in the entire film.Whether you're a die-hard fan of Woody Allen or not, ~The Curse of the Jade Scorpion~ should provide a lot of laughs and that occasional escape we all require from time to time.

543731,A1FDV3WPOHREY9,B00003CY69,"C. Scanlon ""least helpful reviewer""","[1, 1]","This film could have been an all right parody of Thirties Screwball Comedies like Katherine Hepburn and Cary Grant, etc., but there is too much going on to sabotage this, like Joyce's increasingly aggressive narrative voices in Ulysses, which could have been an interesting enough romance, but for those intrusive voices we keep hearing in his head, which make of it something immortal.Just so with this film. It could have been fully funny fluff, but for the subtext of Allen's personal life, possibly the actual impulse for creating this very funny but dark film.We know the acrimonious and excruciating ending of his marriage to Mia Farrow and the incredibly cruel rupture of any relationship with his deeply beloved and only son Satchmo. Thus in this film we see throughout the theme of totalitarianism (including reference to Mussolini and the Chancellor with the little moustache, as well as the extreme totalitarianism of the hypnotist, who may himself be hypnotised under the power of his own mysterious assistant) as exercised against Mr. Allen by the Divorce Courts of Connecticut, but more importantly the theme of two people who deeply love one another to the point of becoming afraid of their own love and need for the other, having suffered great losses and deceptions and trauma in the past, and who thus can only express their deep love for one another under the safety of the deception of hypnosis.Just as Mick Jagger sang out his need for the Nicaraguan Bianca in Miss You (if you can call that singing), this is Allen's love song for the lost Mia. See it again. View it in this way and you will see: this reading holds up. This reading makes of this film something infinitely deeper than the surface story. See it again and you will see.Otherrwise we see a film which does not achieve its objectives. Otherwise the elements do not make sense and the center will not hold. Hunt is otherwise too old to be a recent Vassar grad, and without the Mia subtext, what's with all the drinking and smoking anyway? The hateful words between herself and Allen's character CW may be far more than riffing for this film.The very young Charlize Theron whom the hypnotised Allen character CW walks away from may be a declaration to Mia that he never touched that young girl.With whom did Mia leave? What man swept her away? Here we see a married Dan Akroyd character seducing the Hunt character while still married. We see Dan Akroyd as overweight as Brando in Apocalypse Now, and simply dull. What would Woody say about the man who stole Mia away?Otherwise this is Woody's film. He really has very little to play against, and he is best when alone on screen. What does this say about his life after divorce. We really see no convincing spark with Hunt; he is far too old in this picture, which introduces a distracting element of May-December romance (especially after the irrelevant Theron interjection), or do we see here again reflections of Allen's real life with Kim(?) Previn.Watch him work alone on screen, the long rolling shot stomping down the office hall to confront Hunt in anger, displaying his cinematographer's talent. And one of the funniest scenes in modern cinema is Allen's rooftop escape from the police station, a silent series of quotes from other great physical comedians. His frightened entry through the door echoes Richard Prior with a touch of Kramer. His crossing the roof resembles clearly, as does much in this film, Woody's deep and incomprehensible appreciation of the Bob Hope movies, an appreciation which he here makes clear and effective. His climbing the ladder is nothing but pure Chaplin. Quite a journey through a century of comedy in one quick scene, and pure genius.Nevertheless everyone in this film feels too old, except for Theron and the secretary whose cat must get fed. It is a joy to see the great Professor Irwin Corey once more, who works hard to save the joy of this film. It is also intersting to observe wandering the office at the opening the actor who valiantly worked to salvage Jarmusch'sGhost Dog - The Way of the Samurai. Otherwise this is a much darker film than it appears, in which you truly will laugh and will cry.",4,"Woulda been a competent send-up of Thirties Screwball Comedies but kidnapped, sabotaged and deepened by Allen's personal life",1193097600,"10 23, 2007",2007,4183,"['film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'right', 'parody', 'Thirties', 'Screwball', 'Comedies', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'etc.', 'too', 'much', 'going', 'sabotage', 'Joyce', 'increasingly', 'aggressive', 'narrative', 'voices', 'Ulysses', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'enough', 'romance', 'intrusive', 'voices', 'keep', 'hearing', 'head', 'make', 'something', 'so', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'fully', 'funny', 'fluff', 'subtext', 'Allen', 'personal', 'life', 'possibly', 'actual', 'impulse', 'creating', 'very', 'funny', 'dark', 'film.We', 'know', 'acrimonious', 'excruciating', 'ending', 'marriage', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'incredibly', 'cruel', 'rupture', 'relationship', 'deeply', 'beloved', 'only', 'son', 'Satchmo', 'Thus', 'film', 'see', 'theme', 'totalitarianism', 'including', 'reference', 'Mussolini', 'Chancellor', 'little', 'moustache', 'as', 'well', 'extreme', 'totalitarianism', 'hypnotist', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'hypnotised', 'power', 'own', 'mysterious', 'assistant', 'exercised', 'Mr.', 'Allen', 'Divorce', 'Courts', 'Connecticut', 'more', 'importantly', 'theme', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'deeply', 'love', 'one', 'point', 'becoming', 'afraid', 'own', 'love', 'need', 'other', 'having', 'suffered', 'great', 'losses', 'deceptions', 'trauma', 'past', 'who', 'thus', 'can', 'only', 'express', 'deep', 'love', 'one', 'safety', 'deception', 'hypnosis.Just', 'Mick', 'Jagger', 'sang', 'out', 'need', 'Nicaraguan', 'Bianca', 'Miss', 'can', 'call', 'singing', 'Allen', 'love', 'song', 'lost', 'Mia', 'See', 'again', 'View', 'way', 'will', 'see', 'reading', 'up', 'reading', 'film', 'something', 'infinitely', 'deeper', 'surface', 'story', 'See', 'again', 'will', 'see.Otherrwise', 'see', 'film', 'not', 'achieve', 'objectives', 'Otherwise', 'elements', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'center', 'will', 'not', 'hold', 'Hunt', 'otherwise', 'too', 'old', 'be', 'recent', 'Vassar', 'grad', 'Mia', 'subtext', 'what', 'drinking', 'smoking', 'anyway', 'hateful', 'words', 'Allen', 'character', 'CW', 'may', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'riffing', 'film.The', 'very', 'young', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'whom', 'hypnotised', 'Allen', 'character', 'CW', 'away', 'may', 'be', 'declaration', 'Mia', 'never', 'touched', 'young', 'girl.With', 'whom', 'did', 'Mia', 'leave', 'What', 'man', 'swept', 'away', 'Here', 'see', 'married', 'Dan', 'Akroyd', 'character', 'seducing', 'Hunt', 'character', 'still', 'married', 'see', 'Dan', 'Akroyd', 'as', 'overweight', 'Brando', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'simply', 'dull', 'What', 'would', 'Woody', 'say', 'man', 'who', 'stole', 'Mia', 'away', 'Otherwise', 'Woody', 'film', 'really', 'very', 'little', 'play', 'best', 'when', 'alone', 'screen', 'What', 'say', 'life', 'divorce', 'really', 'see', 'convincing', 'spark', 'Hunt', 'far', 'too', 'old', 'picture', 'distracting', 'element', 'May-December', 'romance', 'especially', 'irrelevant', 'Theron', 'interjection', 'do', 'see', 'here', 'again', 'reflections', 'Allen', 'real', 'life', 'Kim', 'Previn.Watch', 'work', 'alone', 'screen', 'long', 'rolling', 'shot', 'stomping', 'down', 'office', 'hall', 'confront', 'Hunt', 'anger', 'displaying', 'cinematographer', 'talent', 'one', 'funniest', 'scenes', 'modern', 'cinema', 'Allen', 'rooftop', 'escape', 'police', 'station', 'silent', 'series', 'quotes', 'other', 'great', 'physical', 'comedians', 'frightened', 'entry', 'door', 'Richard', 'Prior', 'touch', 'Kramer', 'crossing', 'roof', 'clearly', 'much', 'film', 'Woody', 'deep', 'incomprehensible', 'appreciation', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'movies', 'appreciation', 'here', 'clear', 'effective', 'climbing', 'ladder', 'nothing', 'pure', 'Chaplin', 'journey', 'century', 'comedy', 'one', 'quick', 'scene', 'pure', 'genius.Nevertheless', 'everyone', 'film', 'too', 'old', 'Theron', 'secretary', 'cat', 'must', 'get', 'fed', 'joy', 'see', 'great', 'Professor', 'Irwin', 'Corey', 'once', 'more', 'who', 'hard', 'save', 'joy', 'film', 'also', 'intersting', 'observe', 'wandering', 'office', 'opening', 'actor', 'who', 'valiantly', 'worked', 'salvage', ""Jarmusch'sGhost"", 'Dog', 'Way', 'Samurai', 'Otherwise', 'much', 'darker', 'film', 'truly', 'will', 'laugh', 'will', 'cry']",The Curse of the Jade Scorpion VHS

After watching ""The Curse of the Jade Scorpion"", I will stay say that Woody Allen has not made a bad movie yet.""Curse of the Jade Scorpion"" stars Helen Hunt (Always glamorous on screen), Dan Ackroyd, and the always humorous Woddy Allen. Woody Allen plays the part of a strung out detective, while Helen Hunt plays the part of a well-to-do woman aspiring to be the top detective. These two despise each other from day one, and eventually go on the being hypnotized. The two are assigned words in this hypnotic state, ""Constantanopel"" and ""Natagascar"". When directed at the two, these words can make the two love or hate each other. As the plot continues, we find that the hypnotizer is calling Woody Allen up on the phone, hypnotizing him, and making his rob rich households. If you would like to see how everything works out, go see the movie, I don't want to give anymore of the film away.Woody Allen, to tell you the truth, makes this movie what it is, not because of his usual one-liners, but this time because of his facial expressions. When he is under hypnosis, they are absolutely hysterical! Just looking at his face as it droops down into a dream state, watching him lurch around like a zombie. It's to die for! Woody Allen has that look to him that can always make me laugh, not matter how bad of a day i'm having. The patheticness of it all!Helen Hunt does an excellent job as her character. One of the demands upon this part was managing to come around to hating Woody Allen, and she does a great job at it. When Ms. Hunt wants to be mean, she has the potential to! This is a much different role from the rest of her films. It is a role that demanded self-centeredness, a switch from other roles she has done.The music adds to this film also, as it does in every Woody Allen film. Two songs are repeated, including ""Sophisticated Lady"", a modern day Jazz standard to say the least. The music adds to the truely comedic tone to this film.One cannot dissect this movie, all I have to say is that if you are a Woody Allen fan, just take my word for it and watch this film.

As one picks up an Agatha Christie to see what she has in store for you this time, one attends upon a Woody Allen film  to see what this brick in the edifice of his work has to offer.

Once more he seizes upon a formula, tried and tried again, on stage and screen, and, once again, with a Woody Allen cast, Woody Allen dialogue, and Woody Allen direction, he makes it entertain.So, have no expectation that you are embarked on a voyage filled with penetrating insight into human behavior, with grand ideas about universal truths, or grandiose achievement, you are simply sitting down to 1 hour and  42 minutes of entertainment.Who Can Ask For Anything More.",5,Delightful interlude,1317254400,"09 29, 2011",2011,1299,"['Not', 'many', 'history', 'movies', 'can', 'objectively', 'be', 'credited', 'extensive', 'body', 'work', 'high', 'quality', 'marked', 'distinctive', 'touch', 'own', 'character', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'one', 'creators', 'film', 'reflection', 'film', 'seen', 'aficionado', 'not', 'only', 'thing', 'part', 'larger', 'whole', 'one', 'up', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'see', 'what', 'store', 'time', 'one', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'film', 'see', 'what', 'brick', 'edifice', 'work', 'offer', 'shine', 'more', 'brightly', 'others', 'are', 'failure', 'are', 'still', 'part', 'edifice', 'interest', 'individuality.The', 'Curse', 'Jade', 'Scorpion', 'certainly', 'no', 'worse', 'average', 'therefore', 'wholly', 'entertaining', 'Once', 'more', 'formula', 'tried', 'tried', 'again', 'stage', 'screen', 'once', 'again', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'cast', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'dialogue', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'direction', 'entertain.So', 'have', 'expectation', 'are', 'embarked', 'voyage', 'filled', 'penetrating', 'insight', 'human', 'behavior', 'grand', 'ideas', 'universal', 'truths', 'grandiose', 'achievement', 'are', 'simply', 'sitting', '1', 'hour', '42', 'minutes', 'entertainment.Who', 'Can', 'Ask', 'Anything', 'More']",The Curse of the Jade Scorpion VHS

So it was with a nervous heart that the Sticky decided to eat some roasted eggplant with his fav director, the Woodster and his latest opus; the Curse of the Jade Scorpion!As the Sticky bit into the eggplant he was reminded of the things he hated about the eggplant.  The evil and leathery skin, the squishy insides and that foul smell.  But with the Woodster weaving his magic in front of his eyes, all that melted away as the Sticky chopped on his eggplants and became entranced with movie.In a way the Sticky felt like the Woodster character as the Sticky was also thought of as an old fogey for championing the Sticky.  The way the Sticky had to endure his most hated food eggplant was like the Woodster battling it out with the Huntster.  But sitting in the cinema, feeling the eggplant juices dripping down his chin, the Sticky was held spellbound by the movie, just like the Woodster, and by the end of it, the Sticky realised that sure, his initial reactions to the eggplant might have been valid, but in the end, the Sticky realised he would be inseparable to the eggplant, just like the Woodster and the Huntster!!",4,It's the Egg in the Plant that matters,1021334400,"05 14, 2002",2002,1587,"['years', 'abuse', 'Sticky', 'friend', 'Mr', 'Eurotrash', 'affectionately', 'known', 'closer', 'friends', 'Scampie', 'Sticky', 'decided', 'become', 'more', 'rounded', 'human', 'being', 'would', 'try', 'different', 'experiences', 'different', 'cuisine', 'meant', 'trying', 'one', 'thing', 'dreaded', 'eating', 'eggplant.But', 'successful', 'experiments', 'eating', 'favourite', 'foods', 'bad', 'films', 'actually', 'enjoying', 'movie', 'decided', 'what', 'trying', 'other', 'way', 'round', 'was', 'nervous', 'heart', 'Sticky', 'decided', 'eat', 'roasted', 'eggplant', 'fav', 'director', 'Woodster', 'latest', 'opus', 'Curse', 'Jade', 'Scorpion', 'Sticky', 'bit', 'eggplant', 'was', 'reminded', 'things', 'hated', 'eggplant', 'evil', 'leathery', 'skin', 'squishy', 'insides', 'foul', 'smell', 'Woodster', 'weaving', 'magic', 'front', 'eyes', 'melted', 'away', 'Sticky', 'chopped', 'eggplants', 'became', 'entranced', 'movie.In', 'way', 'Sticky', 'felt', 'Woodster', 'character', 'Sticky', 'was', 'also', 'thought', 'old', 'fogey', 'championing', 'Sticky', 'way', 'Sticky', 'had', 'endure', 'most', 'hated', 'food', 'eggplant', 'was', 'Woodster', 'battling', 'Huntster', 'sitting', 'cinema', 'feeling', 'eggplant', 'juices', 'dripping', 'down', 'chin', 'Sticky', 'was', 'held', 'spellbound', 'movie', 'just', 'Woodster', 'end', 'Sticky', 'realised', 'sure', 'initial', 'reactions', 'eggplant', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'valid', 'end', 'Sticky', 'realised', 'would', 'be', 'inseparable', 'eggplant', 'just', 'Woodster', 'Huntster']",The Curse of the Jade Scorpion VHS

543737,A2KB14WCZ1DVE3,B00003CY69,elvistcob@lvcm.com,"[3, 4]","It's pretty obvious that Woody Allen is not reaching for the stars these days.  Long gone are the days of &quot;Annie Hall&quot; and &quot;Manhatten&quot;, where he tried to be a &quot;serious&quot; comedian.  These days he seems to be content to make simple comedies with some kind of creative twist to them.  As long as they reach at least the quality of this film, that's ok by me.For one thing, even though he doesn't produce blockbusters, actors clamor to get into his films, which is one reason to see them.  Yes, he has his old favorites such as Wallace Shawn, but each movie he directs usually has a cast of pretty recognizable actors to make it interesting.  In this one we get Dan Aykroyd and David Ogden Stiers on the male side, plus the tantalizing trio of Helen Hunt, Charlize Theron, and someone I'm glad is still hanging around movies in Elizabeth Berkley.This movie takes us back to the 1940's, a time Allen seems to like to visit.  These are the times of his boyhood, and, while idealized, probably have some merit as to how things were in those days.  Which, take away today's technology, is probably how we would act.The creative twist here is that Allen, as an insurance investigator, and his office rival Helen Hunt both get hypnotized at an office get-together.  While under hypnosis, these two fall in love, which could almost have been a movie on it's own.  But Allen advances the plot by having the hypnotist, played by Stiers, keep control of them.  This way, he can call them in the middle of the night, and have them burgle the homes of the company's clients, as they know the security systems.I will admit I was taken in by this, and did wonder how Allen was going to write himself out of the mess he gets in, especially when he is caught red-handed with booty (Booty having a different meaning in the 1940's than it has today).  Throughout the story, we are treated to some great sparring between insecure girl-chaser Allen, and tough but vulnerable Hunt.  Some of their lines are keepers to be used by the viewer when the right time comes.My only problems were that the ending is just a bit weak, and despite a handful of good zingers, I wish he could have upped the bar overall with more jokes.  But it's still many cuts above your average comedy today that depends on bodily functions to get laughs.",4,"Woody on cruise control, but that's still good entertainment",1023235200,"06 5, 2002",2002,2332,"['pretty', 'obvious', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'not', 'reaching', 'stars', 'days', 'Long', 'gone', 'are', 'days', 'quot', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'quot', 'quot', 'Manhatten', 'quot', 'where', 'tried', 'be', 'quot', 'serious', 'quot', 'comedian', 'days', 'be', 'content', 'make', 'simple', 'comedies', 'kind', 'creative', 'twist', 'As', 'long', 'reach', 'least', 'quality', 'film', 'ok', 'me.For', 'one', 'thing', 'even', ""n't"", 'produce', 'blockbusters', 'actors', 'clamor', 'get', 'films', 'one', 'reason', 'see', 'Yes', 'old', 'favorites', 'such', 'Wallace', 'Shawn', 'movie', 'usually', 'cast', 'pretty', 'recognizable', 'actors', 'make', 'interesting', 'one', 'get', 'Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'David', 'Ogden', 'Stiers', 'male', 'side', 'tantalizing', 'trio', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'someone', ""'m"", 'glad', 'still', 'hanging', 'movies', 'Elizabeth', 'Berkley.This', 'movie', 'back', '1940', 'time', 'Allen', 'like', 'visit', 'are', 'times', 'boyhood', 'idealized', 'probably', 'have', 'merit', 'how', 'things', 'were', 'days', 'Which', 'take', 'away', 'today', 'technology', 'probably', 'how', 'would', 'act.The', 'creative', 'twist', 'here', 'Allen', 'insurance', 'investigator', 'office', 'rival', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'get', 'hypnotized', 'office', 'get-together', 'hypnosis', 'two', 'fall', 'love', 'could', 'almost', 'have', 'been', 'movie', 'own', 'Allen', 'plot', 'having', 'hypnotist', 'played', 'Stiers', 'keep', 'control', 'way', 'can', 'call', 'middle', 'night', 'have', 'burgle', 'homes', 'company', 'clients', 'know', 'security', 'systems.I', 'will', 'admit', 'was', 'taken', 'did', 'wonder', 'how', 'Allen', 'was', 'going', 'write', 'mess', 'especially', 'when', 'caught', 'red-handed', 'booty', 'Booty', 'having', 'different', 'meaning', '1940', 'today', 'story', 'are', 'treated', 'great', 'sparring', 'insecure', 'girl-chaser', 'Allen', 'tough', 'vulnerable', 'Hunt', 'lines', 'are', 'keepers', 'be', 'used', 'viewer', 'when', 'right', 'time', 'only', 'problems', 'were', 'ending', 'just', 'bit', 'weak', 'handful', 'good', 'zingers', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'upped', 'bar', 'overall', 'more', 'jokes', 'still', 'many', 'cuts', 'average', 'comedy', 'today', 'bodily', 'functions', 'get', 'laughs']",The Curse of the Jade Scorpion VHS

Dan Aykroyd is memorable as Woody's boss, and Helen Hunt is a driven efficiency expert aiming to tighten up the corporate ship, possibly by outsourcing the investigations and firing the in-house talent.Curse is an homage to an earlier, gentler style of comedy, appearing to be set in the 1930s or 40s. The humor depends on suspension of disbelief regarding a hypnotist who programs Woody to behave totally out of character, and the old movie plotline of love developing between opposites who attract is resurrected. The story resolves when the investigator solves the mystery of his own behavior.I found the characters loveable, the dialogue snappy. The whole film has a kind of warm human glow.

Gelwasser,"[13, 13]","The first time I saw ""The Curse of the Jade Scorpion "" in the theatre I disliked it.At the time it seemed over talky and had a claustrophobic feel to it. Woody looked way off on this one.I felt bad because usually I'm a huuuge Woody fan! But the second time I saw the film on DVD, it was a totally different experience. I found this movie to be the perfect companion for the small screen.It just works in this medium.""The Curse of the Jade Scorpion"" is Woody's homage to all those old 1940's Bob Hope movies. You know the ones where Bob is one way or another a cowardly private eye constantly getting into danger and falling in with pretty girls who are usually smarter then he is.Think ""My Favorite Blonde"".In this 40's period film, Woody plays an investigator for an insurance firm who is constantly at verbal odds with the company's acerbic, efficiancy expert named Betty Ann Fitzgerald (well played by Helen Hunt).One night at a company party, in a night club,the pair are brought on stage and hypnotized for the amusement of the audience.All is well, until we later find out that Voltan,the hypnotist, is an evil crook. He has never released the two from their hypnotic suggestion and goes on to use them to steal Jewels from the wealthy clients of the insurance company.This slight plot, which easily could have been lifted from an 1940s short serial,is really an excuse for Allen and Hunt to go at each other with a series of hilarious  exchanges and fights that remind me of verbal sparring matches in movies such as ""The Front Page"" and ""Women of the Year"". Allen and Hunt are backed by an excellent supporting cast that include stand out performances from Dan Aykroyd, Charlize Theron, Wallace Shawn, Elizabeth Berkley and David Ogden Stiers as the evil Voltan.One of the most wonderful features of this film is it's 1940s retro look and feeling.The cinematography and art direction are amazing!It is a really beautiful looking film, which also accuratly gets it's historical period.You feel like your watching an original, old technicolor movie, that would appear on the 'Late Show'at 2am.This is hardly one of the most important movies to come from the Woody Allen film cannon (""Manhattan, ""Annie Hall"", Hannah & Her Sisters""), but I will reccomend it to anyone, who wants an evening of old fashion, light-weight, fun entertainment on the small screen.",4,Woody's Bob Hope Movie!,1017705600,"04 2, 2002",2002,2364,"['first', 'time', 'saw', 'Curse', 'Jade', 'Scorpion', 'theatre', 'disliked', 'it.At', 'time', 'seemed', 'talky', 'had', 'claustrophobic', 'feel', 'Woody', 'looked', 'way', 'one.I', 'felt', 'bad', 'usually', ""'m"", 'huuuge', 'Woody', 'fan', 'second', 'time', 'saw', 'film', 'DVD', 'was', 'totally', 'different', 'experience', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'perfect', 'companion', 'small', 'screen.It', 'just', 'medium', 'Curse', 'Jade', 'Scorpion', 'Woody', 'homage', 'old', '1940', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'movies', 'know', 'ones', 'where', 'Bob', 'one', 'way', 'cowardly', 'private', 'eye', 'constantly', 'getting', 'danger', 'falling', 'pretty', 'girls', 'who', 'are', 'usually', 'smarter', 'then', 'is.Think', 'Favorite', 'Blonde', '.In', '40', 'period', 'film', 'Woody', 'investigator', 'insurance', 'firm', 'who', 'constantly', 'verbal', 'odds', 'company', 'acerbic', 'efficiancy', 'expert', 'named', 'Betty', 'Ann', 'Fitzgerald', 'well', 'played', 'Helen', 'Hunt', '.One', 'night', 'company', 'party', 'night', 'club', 'pair', 'are', 'brought', 'stage', 'hypnotized', 'amusement', 'audience.All', 'well', 'later', 'find', 'out', 'Voltan', 'hypnotist', 'evil', 'crook', 'never', 'released', 'two', 'hypnotic', 'suggestion', 'use', 'steal', 'Jewels', 'wealthy', 'clients', 'insurance', 'company.This', 'slight', 'plot', 'easily', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lifted', '1940s', 'short', 'serial', 'really', 'excuse', 'Allen', 'Hunt', 'go', 'other', 'series', 'hilarious', 'exchanges', 'fights', 'remind', 'verbal', 'sparring', 'matches', 'movies', 'such', 'Front', 'Page', 'Women', 'Year', 'Allen', 'Hunt', 'are', 'backed', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'cast', 'include', 'stand', 'out', 'performances', 'Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'Wallace', 'Shawn', 'Elizabeth', 'Berkley', 'David', 'Ogden', 'Stiers', 'evil', 'Voltan.One', 'most', 'wonderful', 'features', 'film', '1940s', 'retro', 'look', 'feeling.The', 'cinematography', 'art', 'direction', 'are', 'amazing', 'really', 'beautiful', 'looking', 'film', 'also', 'accuratly', 'historical', 'period.You', 'feel', 'watching', 'original', 'old', 'technicolor', 'movie', 'would', 'appear', ""'Late"", ""Show'at"", '2am.This', 'hardly', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'movies', 'come', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'film', 'cannon', 'Manhattan', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'Hannah', 'Sisters', 'will', 'reccomend', 'anyone', 'who', 'evening', 'old', 'fashion', 'light-weight', 'fun', 'entertainment', 'small', 'screen']",The Curse of the Jade Scorpion VHS
543747,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00003CY69,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 2]","""The Curse of the Jade Scorpion"" is another nostalgic comedy from Woody Allen, in the tradition of ""Radio Days"" and ""The Purple Rose of Cairo."" What makes it different is that Allen's character, C. W. Briggs, is not the normal schlep we associate with such films. Actually, he is a seasoned investigator for an insurance company, who has just successfully recovered a stolen Picasso painting, despite the fact it is just a bunch of colored cubes. Unfortunately C.W. is old school and Betty Ann Fitzgerald (Helen Hunt), the new efficiency expert in the office represents the future and the new thinking that is part of the 1940s. The two trade insults in the office, with the lady getting the better of it. When they are out with the rest of the office at a nightclub the pair are pulled up before the audience by a hypnotist, Voltan Polgar (David Ogden Stiers), who convinces the two that they are on their honeymoon by dazzling them with his Jade Scorpion. Of course, C.W. and Fitz do not remember any of this happening. More to the point, Voltan has planted triggers in the couple and not bothered to turn them off. After all, C.W. knows the security systems for all sort of house wherein there are all sorts of jewelry.The key line in the film is when C.W. muses about what the situation would be like if he had to try and catch himself, because that is essentially the scenario for the rest of the film. Meanwhile Allen complicates this basic scenario. Fitz is having an affair with their boss, Chris Magruder (Dan Ackroyd) while C.W. has somehow caught the attention of spoiled little rich girl, Laura Kensington (Charlize Theron). Eventually C.W. is confronted with the evidence of his crimes, which, of course, comes as an unpleasant surprise. The office is divided over whether or not to believe the evidence and through it all the phone keeps ringing and a deep voice intones one of the mabic words. The end result is that ""The Curse of the Jade Scorpion"" is a trifle all things considered, but it still an amusing and enjoyable little film. There are certainly more one-liners in this film than your ordinary Woody Allen film, which is always pleasant enough.The costumes and sets make for a superb period piece, enhanced by the cinematography of Zhao Fei. Helen Hunt makes for a pretty good antagonist for Woody, who has never had a female lead deliver lines with such assuredness and venom, which may well explain why she is given such a great run of insults to hurl throughout the film. Allen gets as much mileage out of the hypnotism idea as possible without rendering the situation absurd. As always, the supporting cast assembled by Allen is superb, including Wallace Shawn, Elizabeth Berkley, and Brian Markinson, and the film is scored with classic jazz and pop songs of the period. Not a great film, but a nice little one, which is good enough in these times.",4,A hypnotist turns Woody Allen into a jewel thief,1052870400,"05 14, 2003",2003,2878,"['Curse', 'Jade', 'Scorpion', 'nostalgic', 'comedy', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'tradition', 'Radio', 'Days', 'Purple', 'Rose', 'Cairo', 'What', 'different', 'Allen', 'character', 'C.', 'W.', 'Briggs', 'not', 'normal', 'schlep', 'associate', 'such', 'films', 'Actually', 'seasoned', 'investigator', 'insurance', 'company', 'who', 'just', 'successfully', 'recovered', 'stolen', 'Picasso', 'painting', 'fact', 'just', 'bunch', 'colored', 'cubes', 'Unfortunately', 'C.W', 'old', 'school', 'Betty', 'Ann', 'Fitzgerald', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'new', 'efficiency', 'expert', 'office', 'future', 'new', 'thinking', 'part', '1940s', 'two', 'trade', 'insults', 'office', 'lady', 'getting', 'better', 'When', 'are', 'rest', 'office', 'nightclub', 'pair', 'are', 'pulled', 'up', 'audience', 'hypnotist', 'Voltan', 'Polgar', 'David', 'Ogden', 'Stiers', 'who', 'two', 'are', 'honeymoon', 'dazzling', 'Jade', 'Scorpion', 'course', 'C.W', 'Fitz', 'do', 'not', 'remember', 'happening', 'More', 'point', 'Voltan', 'planted', 'triggers', 'couple', 'not', 'bothered', 'turn', 'off', 'C.W', 'security', 'systems', 'sort', 'house', 'wherein', 'are', 'sorts', 'jewelry.The', 'key', 'line', 'film', 'when', 'C.W', 'muses', 'what', 'situation', 'would', 'be', 'had', 'try', 'catch', 'essentially', 'scenario', 'rest', 'film', 'Meanwhile', 'Allen', 'basic', 'scenario', 'Fitz', 'having', 'affair', 'boss', 'Chris', 'Magruder', 'Dan', 'Ackroyd', 'C.W', 'somehow', 'caught', 'attention', 'spoiled', 'little', 'rich', 'girl', 'Laura', 'Kensington', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'Eventually', 'C.W', 'confronted', 'evidence', 'crimes', 'course', 'unpleasant', 'surprise', 'office', 'divided', 'not', 'believe', 'evidence', 'phone', 'ringing', 'deep', 'voice', 'intones', 'one', 'mabic', 'words', 'end', 'result', 'Curse', 'Jade', 'Scorpion', 'trifle', 'things', 'considered', 'still', 'amusing', 'enjoyable', 'little', 'film', 'are', 'certainly', 'more', 'one-liners', 'film', 'ordinary', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'film', 'always', 'pleasant', 'enough.The', 'costumes', 'sets', 'make', 'superb', 'period', 'piece', 'enhanced', 'cinematography', 'Zhao', 'Fei', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'pretty', 'good', 'antagonist', 'Woody', 'who', 'never', 'had', 'female', 'lead', 'deliver', 'lines', 'such', 'assuredness', 'venom', 'may', 'well', 'explain', 'why', 'given', 'great', 'run', 'insults', 'hurl', 'film', 'Allen', 'as', 'much', 'mileage', 'hypnotism', 'idea', 'possible', 'rendering', 'situation', 'absurd', 'always', 'supporting', 'cast', 'assembled', 'Allen', 'superb', 'including', 'Wallace', 'Shawn', 'Elizabeth', 'Berkley', 'Brian', 'Markinson', 'film', 'scored', 'classic', 'jazz', 'pop', 'songs', 'period', 'Not', 'great', 'film', 'nice', 'little', 'one', 'good', 'enough', 'times']",The Curse of the Jade Scorpion VHS
543748,A19WRXQ7EG8QF5,B00003CY69,"L. Carol ""carolcecilia, D.V.""","[5, 7]","I first watched ""Curse of the Jade Scorpion"" on a business flight and literally laughed my head off from start to finish. In fact, given the duration of the flight, I re-watched the movie back-to-back and found myself relishing the ingenuity and humor of the script second time round over the space of an hour. Bought the DVD immediately as I returned home and watched the movie for the third time over the course of three days. Cross my heart, I continued to crack up over the quirky lines and snapbacks so diligently peppered throughout this gem of a comedy.Some may argue the plot was ultra-predictable. But coining a wonderful phrase Allen's character quoted in the movie, it would be ""multiple stupidity"" to ignore a highly entertaining movie on the basis of this. The supporting cast was sensational, especially Charlize Theron playing drop-dead gorgeous femme fatale Laura Kensington against Allen's investigator CW Briggs. The scene where she lured Allen without success was done with such great panache and comic timing.Naturally, like many reviewers in this space, I have been a big fan of Woody Allen, especially for his nostalgic films of the bygone years immortalised in movies like ""Purple Rose of Cairo"", ""Radio Days"", ""Love & Death"" et al. What I am most pleasantly surprised by ""Curse"" is the inimitable return of Allenesque's hilarity and self-mockery, and if anything, much more so at a time when some critics deemed to be in his senile, old age.  ""Curse of the Jade Scorpion"" is amongst the best of his period pieces, celebrating great sets by Santos Loquasto, Woodman's tasteful choice of music for the soundtrack (check out the ingenious use of music on the entrance of Laura Kensington) and featuring a familiar Woodman cast doing what they did best - having a whale of a time while filming.",5,"Play it Again, Woody!!!!",1013644800,"02 14, 2002",2002,1814,"['first', 'watched', 'Curse', 'Jade', 'Scorpion', 'business', 'flight', 'literally', 'laughed', 'head', 'start', 'finish', 'fact', 'given', 'duration', 'flight', 're-watched', 'movie', 'back-to-back', 'found', 'relishing', 'ingenuity', 'humor', 'script', 'second', 'time', 'round', 'space', 'hour', 'Bought', 'DVD', 'immediately', 'returned', 'home', 'watched', 'movie', 'third', 'time', 'course', 'three', 'days', 'Cross', 'heart', 'continued', 'crack', 'up', 'quirky', 'lines', 'snapbacks', 'so', 'diligently', 'peppered', 'gem', 'comedy.Some', 'may', 'argue', 'plot', 'was', 'ultra-predictable', 'coining', 'wonderful', 'phrase', 'Allen', 'character', 'quoted', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'multiple', 'stupidity', 'ignore', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'basis', 'supporting', 'cast', 'was', 'sensational', 'especially', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'playing', 'drop-dead', 'gorgeous', 'femme', 'fatale', 'Laura', 'Kensington', 'Allen', 'investigator', 'CW', 'Briggs', 'scene', 'where', 'lured', 'Allen', 'success', 'was', 'done', 'such', 'great', 'panache', 'comic', 'timing.Naturally', 'many', 'reviewers', 'space', 'have', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'especially', 'nostalgic', 'films', 'bygone', 'years', 'immortalised', 'movies', 'Purple', 'Rose', 'Cairo', 'Radio', 'Days', 'Love', 'Death', 'et', 'al', 'What', 'am', 'most', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'Curse', 'inimitable', 'return', 'Allenesque', 'hilarity', 'self-mockery', 'anything', 'much', 'more', 'so', 'time', 'when', 'critics', 'deemed', 'be', 'senile', 'old', 'age', 'Curse', 'Jade', 'Scorpion', 'best', 'period', 'pieces', 'celebrating', 'great', 'sets', 'Santos', 'Loquasto', 'Woodman', 'tasteful', 'choice', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'check', 'out', 'ingenious', 'use', 'music', 'entrance', 'Laura', 'Kensington', 'featuring', 'familiar', 'Woodman', 'cast', 'doing', 'what', 'did', 'best', 'having', 'whale', 'time', 'filming']",The Curse of the Jade Scorpion VHS

543750,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00003CY69,Matthew Horner,"[2, 4]","Woody Allen is one of our most prolific directors, averaging about a movie a year for over thirty years. His audience in the last decade has dwindled down to a cult following. I think that this has less to do with the fact that his movies typically revolve around his own neuroses and phobias than the plain truth that his work just isn't as good as it used to be. His last really great one was Broadway Danny Rose back in 1994. Since then, they have ranged from merely good to mediocre. The Curse of the Jade Scorpion, unfortunately, is in the latter category.Before I go further, let me say that Allen's legacy is already assured, since at least a dozen of his movies are classics. Manhattan, Annie Hall, Crimes and Misdemeanors and Hannah and her Sisters are some of them. Hopefully, Allen has a few more gems still to come.The Curse of the Jade Scorpion takes place in 1940, one of Allen's favorite time periods. He plays C.W. Biggs, an insurance investigator. He's had a lot of success over the years, but currently he's having a problem with the company's new efficiency expert, Betty Ann (Helen Hunt). They just don't like each other, which here in romantic comedy land means they will wind up falling in love. When they attend a company party at a nightclub, they get hypnotized by Voltan (David Ogden Stiers), the club's star attraction. What they don't realize is that they are now in Voltan's power. He plans to use them to rob wealthy people of their very expensive jewelry. They won't know they are doing this, and Biggs, the investigator, unwittingly winds up on the trail of himself.Allen also writes the scripts for his movies, and here he has produced one of the weaker ones. The lines just don't have the zing we expect of him. There are also some continuity problems. After Biggs and Betty Ann carry out Voltan's heists, they are not suppose to remember anything from the time he calls until they wake up. Several times, though, they also don't remember events from before Voltan's calls. This is a minor point, but one expects more from Allen.There has been a running joke in many Allen movies involving beautiful women's being attracted to his short, skinny characters. Here the woman is the wonderful Charlize Theron, who plays a wealthy, weird heiress. Ms. Theron is 28. Allen is 66. The joke isn't funny anymore because Allen's age now makes it more than a little creepy, even though we know he is probably parodying himself. Longevity may run in Allen's family, but maturity apparently does not, which may be the reason his movies have had such trouble moving onto the next plateau.Technically, the movie is fine. I've always loved Allen's use of old songs in all his works. In real life, he's also a good jazz musician. The photography and the set decoration are first rate. The color is muted, and it looks like we really are back in 1940. If only the story and the jokes had been as well done.",2,Running Allen gags are getting tired and a little creepy,1016582400,"03 20, 2002",2002,2921,"['Woody', 'Allen', 'one', 'most', 'prolific', 'directors', 'averaging', 'movie', 'year', 'thirty', 'years', 'audience', 'last', 'decade', 'dwindled', 'down', 'cult', 'following', 'think', 'less', 'do', 'fact', 'movies', 'typically', 'revolve', 'own', 'neuroses', 'phobias', 'plain', 'truth', 'work', 'just', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'used', 'be', 'last', 'really', 'great', 'one', 'was', 'Broadway', 'Danny', 'Rose', 'back', '1994', 'then', 'have', 'ranged', 'merely', 'good', 'mediocre', 'Curse', 'Jade', 'Scorpion', 'unfortunately', 'latter', 'category.Before', 'go', 'further', 'let', 'say', 'Allen', 'legacy', 'already', 'assured', 'least', 'dozen', 'movies', 'are', 'classics', 'Manhattan', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'Crimes', 'Misdemeanors', 'Hannah', 'Sisters', 'are', 'Hopefully', 'Allen', 'few', 'more', 'gems', 'still', 'come.The', 'Curse', 'Jade', 'Scorpion', 'place', '1940', 'one', 'Allen', 'favorite', 'time', 'periods', 'C.W', 'Biggs', 'insurance', 'investigator', 'had', 'lot', 'success', 'years', 'currently', 'having', 'problem', 'company', 'new', 'efficiency', 'expert', 'Betty', 'Ann', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'other', 'here', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'land', 'will', 'wind', 'up', 'falling', 'love', 'When', 'attend', 'company', 'party', 'nightclub', 'get', 'hypnotized', 'Voltan', 'David', 'Ogden', 'Stiers', 'club', 'star', 'attraction', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'are', 'now', 'Voltan', 'power', 'use', 'rob', 'wealthy', 'people', 'very', 'expensive', 'jewelry', 'wo', ""n't"", 'know', 'are', 'doing', 'Biggs', 'investigator', 'unwittingly', 'up', 'trail', 'himself.Allen', 'also', 'scripts', 'movies', 'here', 'produced', 'one', 'weaker', 'ones', 'lines', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'zing', 'expect', 'are', 'also', 'continuity', 'problems', 'Biggs', 'Betty', 'Ann', 'carry', 'out', 'Voltan', 'heists', 'are', 'not', 'suppose', 'remember', 'anything', 'time', 'wake', 'up', 'Several', 'times', 'though', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'events', 'Voltan', 'calls', 'minor', 'point', 'one', 'more', 'Allen.There', 'been', 'running', 'joke', 'many', 'Allen', 'movies', 'involving', 'beautiful', 'women', 'being', 'attracted', 'short', 'skinny', 'characters', 'Here', 'woman', 'wonderful', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'who', 'wealthy', 'weird', 'heiress', 'Ms.', 'Theron', '28', 'Allen', '66', 'joke', ""n't"", 'funny', 'anymore', 'Allen', 'age', 'now', 'more', 'little', 'creepy', 'even', 'know', 'probably', 'parodying', 'Longevity', 'may', 'run', 'Allen', 'family', 'maturity', 'apparently', 'not', 'may', 'be', 'reason', 'movies', 'have', 'had', 'such', 'trouble', 'moving', 'next', 'plateau.Technically', 'movie', 'fine', ""'ve"", 'always', 'loved', 'Allen', 'use', 'old', 'songs', 'works', 'real', 'life', 'also', 'good', 'jazz', 'musician', 'photography', 'set', 'decoration', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'color', 'muted', 'really', 'are', 'back', '1940', 'only', 'story', 'jokes', 'had', 'been', 'as', 'well', 'done']",The Curse of the Jade Scorpion VHS

Yes, it's a deliberately retro period piece and possibly irrelevant to &quot;modern&quot; film audiences (whatever that means).  But, like so many of Allen's films, there is so much more to &quot;Jade Scorpion&quot; than meets the eye.  Study it just a little more closely, and rich shades of meaning will uncover themselves from its lightweight covers.  The difference between hypnosis and self-hypnosis, dream and reality, innocent man and theif, conscious and subconscious is all beautifully and cleverly interwoven in a script which contains almost perfect dialogue.  They just don't write one-liners like this anymore; Hunt and Allen exchange zingers with lightning-fast rapidity, and that alone is worth the price of admission.  But along the way one is treated to a plot containing many surprising twists and turns; there is also one hilarious moment where Akroyd and Hunt are describing Allen's character, Biggs, exactly as they would Allen and then add that he was &quot;previously married to some tramp&quot;...the oblique reference to Mia Farrow did not escape my attention, and I was giggling for five minutes afterward.Do not let the light tone of this film fool you; like most of Allen's pure comedies, it will be dismissed by some as insubstantial, which is a shame.  His recent artistic renaissance (&quot;Deconstructing Harry&quot;, &quot;Sweet And Lowdown&quot;, &quot;Everyone Says I Love You&quot;) has been questioned by some, for what reasons I still cannot fathom--but there will always be those who are jealous of a functioning genius.  Indeed, it is the light tone of this film which makes it soenjoyable; it passes by in no time at all (always the mark of something highly watchable), and when it's over you are left to ponder the deeper meaning behind the facade.

""The Curse of the Jade Scorpion"" comes in as ""Good"" which, obviously, isn't Bad.  It has an interesting plot twist with a fair amount of humor.  However, things just don't seem to click on all cyllanders in this movie.  Oddly, Woody seems to have put himself in a role that he either wasn't up to or lost interest in.  The way the characters interact with one another seems a bit stiff.  The movie seems to take a bit too much time to gets it's point across.  There seems to be more potential for humor than actual realization thereof.  In addition, there seems to be a lack of ""energy"" in this film.  However, these are criticisms of a Woody Allen movie; any other writer/director/actor would rate a ""4"" for humor and originality.

543755,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00003CY69,Reviewer,"[10, 11]","Doing a period piece seems to put Woody Allen at the top of his game, possibly because he has the intrinsic ability to capture a specific time and place and make a truly transporting experience out of it.  Which is exactly what he's done with ""The Curse of the Jade Scorpion,"" which he not only wrote and directed, but stars in, as well.  Set in 1940, it's the story of CW Briggs (Allen), an investigator for an insurance company which, despite the exemplary achievements of CW has been slipping at the bottom line, forcing the company's exec., Chris Magruder (Dan Aykroyd), to call upon the services of an efficiency expert, Betty Ann Fitzgerald (Helen Hunt).  But there's a problem right from the start, in that CW and Betty Ann simply do not hit it off.  And the situation is quickly exacerbated when a rash of thefts-- involving millions of dollars worth of jewelry and goods-- begins to occur among clients for whom the company has installed security systems.  An inside job is suspected, and to CW's chagrin, more outside help is brought in.  So now CW has to contend with that, as well as his new nemesis, Betty Ann; and the way he sees it, there's only one way to fix it all:  Solve the case.  And with that, the hunt is on...Character and dialogue driven, Allen's film is loaded with atmosphere and detail that really puts you in the story; you can almost feel Bogart's presence in such films as ""The Big Sleep"" and ""The Maltese Falcon,"" the spirits of which permeate this film.  The dialogue is snappy and clever-- some of Allen's best ever-- and he presents it all in a way that sustains interest and makes it thoroughly involving and entertaining.  In fact, it's the ongoing banter between CW and Betty Ann that really makes this one click, and it's perfectly delivered, with timing by Allen and Hunt that is right on the mark.This is the most screen time Allen has had, himself, in some time, and he's good; his trademark neurotic groping-for-a-word delivery is tempered and finely tuned, which makes his character entirely credible.  Allen is looking older, but he's growing into his age well, and actually has a much less disheveled appearance here than usual, which has seemingly been an innate trait of his regardless of the role he's playing.  And, though there have been films of his that one could say simply had too much ""Woody"" in them, that is not the case here.  It's a good performance, his scenes with Hunt are alive, and he has some moments with Charlize Theron that are even better.Hunt does a great job, too; Betty Ann is a bit like her Darcy McGuire in ""What Women Want,"" but with a harder, more intimidating edge that works well for this character.  She manages to make Betty Ann both feminine and feminist at the same time, reminiscent of some of the characters that Davis, Crawford and Stanwyck played so successfully in films past.  There's some obvious chemistry at work in her scenes with Allen-- the one in which they are hypnotized is hilarious-- but it's absent in her screen time with Aykroyd, though it may have more to do with their respective characters than anything.  And it's refreshing to see a strong female character to whom Allen's character can relate on a personal level that, though it involves conflict, is devoid of his typically neurotic and paranoid responses.  They may not like each other, but CW at least relates to Betty Ann in a very straightforward manner.  It has to do with the way the characters were written, of course, but part of it is in the way Hunt transfers the Betty Ann found on the page into a real person.One of the highlights of this film is the performance by Charlize Theron, in which, as Laura Kensington, she is transformed into the second coming of Lauren Bacall.  Laura is the epitome of the femme fatale, in the way she looks, speaks and moves; you keep waiting for her to say ""You know how to whistle, don't you Steve?""  It's a supporting role that actually affords Theron comparatively little screen time, but she makes the most of it, and she is certainly a memorable asset to the film.Also effective in a small, but pivotal role, is David Ogden Stiers, as Volton, a part that would have been so perfect for the late Orson Welles.  In the absence of Welles, however, Stiers does a very commendable job.Allen put together a terrific supporting cast for this one, including John Schuck (Mize), Elizabeth Berkley (Jill), Wallace Shawn (George), John Tormey (Sam), Kaili Vernoff (Rosie), Brian Markinson (Al) and Peter Gerety (Ned).  There's an inspired precision to this film, in the way Allen blends the story, characters and music (such a big part of creating that necessary atmosphere) that makes ""The Curse of the Jade Scorpion"" something of a minor classic in the Allen canon.  Aficionados of the classic films of this period will be especially delighted with this one, but anyone who appreciates a film that is well crafted and delivered and provides some solid entertainment will be satisfied, as well.  Allen geared this film to a specific audience (albeit fairly wide), and for those who fall within it's parameters, it's right on target.  One has to wonder, though, why he didn't film it in glorious black &amp; white, which would have been so perfect.  But taken as it is, it's still a part of the magic of the movies.",4,Allen Scores With &quot;Scorpion&quot;,1013990400,"02 18, 2002",2002,5314,"['Doing', 'period', 'piece', 'put', 'Woody', 'Allen',

The directing was similar and the dating and hitting on pretty women was also like what we have seen in many of his other films. The story is well written much like most of his others but the story is original. I liked the idea that people were being used to do illegal tasks without even knowing it. The movie also contains some quick-on-the-draw comedy from Allen that is very reminiscent to every other role that he has done. The DVD is not filled/loaded with extras because of the film's lack to earn a substantial amount of money at the box office.

And this frothy film certainly has plenty of good lines, and the major plot device (that Allen's insurance investigator has been hypnotized into burglarizing houses, and then he's assigned to investigate the cases, not knowing he's the guilty party) is fun.However, this is the movie where I FINALLY had enough of Woody Allen hooking up with much younger and attractive women.  I've put up with it for years, but he and Helen Hunt generate ABSOLUTELY no heat, and Allen looks quite distasteful pairing with her (and also briefly with Charlize Theron...yeah, right!!).  It was, simply, offensive.  I was embarrased for her, and could only shake my head about him.So, an otherwise light but fun movie was, for me, almost fatally marred by their jarring pairing.  The set and costume designs are excellent, as always, the music is Allen's usual selection of great, jaunty jazz and the performances are fun, with everyone working off the same page as far as their tone.  So, if you're a big Allen fan, I'd say you should see it.  If you aren't a big Allen fan, or haven't really experienced him before, STAY AWAY.

He sticks to a basic format and usually doesn't stray to far from it (Match Point being the exception) but you can always count on him, and that's what matters.  Sure, he plays himself in every movie he's ever written himself into, but he's just so likable that it doesn't bother me.  Many will say he's been been on a perpetual downslide over the past decade and a half but consider how many movies he's put out during that time.I really liked this one.  It was clever, very funny, and had a well rounded cast.  It was a period piece which was a nice touch and music to suit that period during the 40's.  Woody works as an insurance investigator and when jewls begins dissapearing from homes where he set up the security systems, he is hot on the trail.  What he doesn't know is during a dinner out he was hypnotized into doing it himself!  Meanwhile, Helen Hunt is having an affair with boss Dan Aykroyd and Woody suspects her suspicious behavior as a sign that she is the jewl thief.  A situation ripe for comedy.If the movie has any short comings it's that it maybe follows the Woody formula a little too closely to the point where it becomes predictable.  In typical Woody fashion, he ends up with a girl half his age (I don't think the age of his love interests have increased since Diane Keaton in Annie Hall) after rejecting a smoking hot siren even younger (very similar to Hollywood Ending).

543763,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00003CY69,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[1, 6]","I find it unfortunate when great artists feel that they have to dumb down their work to appeal to the masses.New York. 1940. CW Briggs (Woody Allen), the top investigator at an insurance firm, hates the firm's new efficiency expert, Betty Ann Fitzgerald (Helen Hunt). CW is a bit antiquated. He still calls the girls `toots' and pinches them on their bottom. Betty Ann is a modern woman that will do whatever has to be done to get the job done. The boss (Dan Aykroyd) invites everyone out to dinner to celebrate a co-workers birthday. Voltan (David Ogden Stiers), a hypnotist at the nightclub, asks for volunteers and immediately puts both CW and Betty Ann under his spell. Each will do whatever he asks when he mentions the words `Constantinople' or `Madagascar'. To prove his point, he makes them act as though they are madly in love with each other, much to the delight of everyone else in the office. Soon, some of the firm's biggest clients have their jewels robbed from their homes. CW becomes a suspect.I am a huge Woody Allen fan, but, frankly, his last few films have proven to me that he either doesn't have the heart for it anymore or he is making his films `more accessible' to appeal to a larger audience. ""Small Time Crooks"" was Woody Allen-lite, and provided his biggest hit in years. ""The Curse of the Jade Scorpion"" follows the same path. The subject matter is so ripe for parody, that Allen, clearly a fan of the period, could have made a great film. Instead, he made a film that, while it looks good, quickly becomes tiresome.The best thing about ""Small Time Crooks"" was that Woody eventually falls in love with Elaine May's character, a woman who is Woody's equal in age. This seemed to be a step in the right direction. Woody didn't seem to be so concerned with women three to four generations younger than he was. Perhaps Woody had matured enough to accept his own age. In ""The Curse of the Jade Scorpion"", Woody's character is apparently so irresistible that he attracts characters played by Charlize Theron, Helen Hunt and Elizabeth Berkley. Each of them kisses him at some point. Does he think this is believable? Yes, he makes self-deprecating comments about his looks and his age, but come on.While there are a few laughs, the level of writing nowhere matches the level attained by Woody in ""Manhattan"", ""Annie Hall"" or ""Crimes & Misdemeanors"". Hell, it doesn't even come close to ""Manhattan Murder Mystery"". When Woody's fans go to his films they expect involving stories with involving characters. We experience the characters lives through their many twists and turns. They seem believable because so much happens to them and they experience so much as we watch. ""Curse of the Jade Scorpion"" pretty much concentrates on the CW Briggs and Betty Ann characters. As we watch their relationship develop, we can pretty much guess how the relationship will be resolved an hour or so before it happens.The whole jewelry theft subplot becomes tiresome. The characters walk through the parts, literally in a trance, providing little of interest.Dan Aykroyd, Charlize Theron, Wallace Shawn and David Ogden Stiers provide the usual star-studded back-up. They are all as effective as can be. Elizabeth Berkley plays the young office worker, CW's assistant, who is completely infatuated with him. It is time for Berkley to take some acting lessons. Even she can not pull off her brief parts. I never once believed she was born before the Forties. She always looks like an actress playing a role.""The Curse of the Jade Scorpion"" is a largely unfunny, tiring, tedious film, easily one of Woody Allen's worst.

543764,A9U5CELFTZ4U8,B00003CY69,"T. J. Bacon ""TJB""","[1, 3]","In BriefSet in 1940's Jazz filled New York, Woody Allen stars as an ace insurance investigator named C W Briggs.  A man who prides himself on his ability to crack any case finally meets his match when he himself becomes the crook under the hypnotic spell of an evil mastermind.  Can he break the spell before its too late, or will the new efficiency expert (Helen Hunt) break him first - or is she under a spell too?ReviewThis, like many of Allen's films are finding it harder and harder to get a distributor.  The Curse of the Jade Scorpion in particular was made and released back last year and it is only now that it finally has reached our shores.  So why is one of the greatest auteurs of the 20th Century being shunned?  Well like any athlete in the Olympics, once you've won gold your judged on the standard of that championship win and not how well you have performed on the day, this is the same for Allen.  An audience has a certain expectation about a Woody Allen picture, and unfortunately The Curse of the Jade Scorpion does not match up.As always the wry sharp dialogue of Allen is spot on, and while the performance constructed by Aykroyd grated it fitted the persona of Briggs' shallow boss perfectly.  Hunt was steamy, strong and as Allen's leading lady, you couldn't have asked for more.  Yet the farcical nature of the narrative was as irritating as the music that indicated that this was a `crazy' slamming door farcical moment.  Most surprising of all was the amount of shots with the boom in view - one realises that it is the job of the projectionist to mask these but the fact that an auteur of Allen's standard allowed them to reach the final negative is shocking.One of the greatest strengths in the film comes in the guise of the environment that has been created in making a believable 1940's New York City.  The Rainbow Room party scene looks as if had been taken straight from the period.  It isn't an overstated stylised forties, and this is to Allen, Santo Loquasto, and Suzanne McCabe's credit, people look normal, dressed down, simple forties style, the only glimpse of glamour coming through Charlize Theron's sassy Laura Kensington.  While the jazz soundtrack had many a toe tapping in the audience, creating a beautiful sense in the mind of a dirty but sexy city.  Indeed the dirty wallpaper & lighting in Briggs' apartment fascinated me as it was as brilliant statement of character as the acting itself.The VerdictThis is essentially the work of a great man on autopilot - hopefully he will steer out of these nose dives in the future, as the novelty of Hollywood talent queuing up to work with him will wear thin.  Only then we will be faced with the bare truth that there really isn't much to a film like this.  It's harsh to look at something that is reasonable fair in such a manner, but judged he must be and we all know that he can do so much better.",2,WEAK,1073433600,"01 7, 2004",2004,2895,"['BriefSet', '1940', 'Jazz', 'filled', 'New', 'York', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'ace', 'insurance', 'investigator', 'named', 'C', 'W', 'Briggs', 'A', 'man', 'who', 'ability', 'crack', 'case', 'finally', 'match', 'when', 'crook', 'hypnotic', 'spell', 'evil', 'mastermind', 'Can', 'break', 'spell', 'too', 'late', 'will', 'new', 'efficiency', 'expert', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'break', 'first', 'spell', 'too', 'ReviewThis', 'many', 'Allen', 'films', 'are', 'finding', 'harder', 'harder', 'get', 'distributor', 'Curse', 'Jade', 'Scorpion', 'particular', 'was', 'made', 'released', 'back', 'last', 'year', 'only', 'now', 'finally', 'reached', 'shores', 'So', 'why', 'one', 'greatest', 'auteurs', '20th', 'Century', 'being', 'shunned', 'Well', 'athlete', 'Olympics', 'once', ""'ve"", 'won', 'gold', 'judged', 'standard', 'championship', 'win', 'not', 'how', 'well', 'have', 'performed', 'day', 'same', 'Allen', 'audience', 'certain', 'expectation', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'picture', 'unfortunately', 'Curse', 'Jade', 'Scorpion', 'not', 'match', 'up.As', 'always', 'wry', 'sharp', 'dialogue', 'Allen', 'spot', 'performance', 'constructed', 'Aykroyd', 'grated', 'fitted', 'persona', 'Briggs', 'shallow', 'boss', 'perfectly', 'Hunt', 'was', 'steamy', 'strong', 'Allen', 'leading', 'lady', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'asked', 'more', 'farcical', 'nature', 'narrative', 'was', 'as', 'irritating', 'music', 'indicated', 'was', 'crazy', 'slamming', 'door', 'farcical', 'moment', 'Most', 'surprising', 'was', 'amount', 'shots', 'boom', 'view', 'one', 'job', 'projectionist', 'mask', 'fact', 'auteur', 'Allen', 'standard', 'allowed', 'reach', 'final', 'negative', 'shocking.One', 'greatest', 'strengths', 'film', 'guise', 'environment', 'been', 'created', 'making', 'believable', '1940', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Rainbow', 'Room', 'party', 'scene', 'had', 'been', 'taken', 'straight', 'period', ""n't"", 'overstated', 'stylised', 'forties', 'Allen', 'Santo', 'Loquasto', 'Suzanne', 'McCabe', 'credit', 'people', 'look', 'normal', 'dressed', 'down', 'simple', 'forties', 'style', 'only', 'glimpse', 'glamour', 'coming', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'sassy', 'Laura', 'Kensington', 'jazz', 'soundtrack', 'had', 'many', 'toe', 'tapping', 'audience', 'creating', 'beautiful', 'sense', 'mind', 'dirty', 'sexy', 'city', 'Indeed', 'dirty', 'wallpaper', 'lighting', 'Briggs', 'apartment', 'fascinated', 'was', 'brilliant', 'statement', 'character', 'acting', 'itself.The', 'VerdictThis', 'essentially', 'work', 'great', 'man', 'autopilot', 'hopefully', 'will', 'steer', 'nose', 'dives', 'future', 'novelty', 'Hollywood', 'talent', 'queuing', 'up', 'work', 'will', 'wear', 'thin', 'Only', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'faced', 'bare', 'truth', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'film', 'harsh', 'look', 'something', 'reasonable', 'fair', 'such', 'manner', 'judged', 'must', 'be', 'know', 'can', 'do', 'so', 'much', 'better']",The Curse of the Jade Scorpion VHS
