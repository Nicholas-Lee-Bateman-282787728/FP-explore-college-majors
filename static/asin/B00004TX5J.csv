She accepts a marriage proposal from Paolo Gallmann, a man she doesn't know well, and she moves to Kenya with him and her young son to start a cattle ranch. Challenges beset her, not the least of which is Paulo's love of danger and his leaving for days on end to hunt and fish with pals. She must face fierce storms, roving lions, venomous snakes, and murderous poachers, and she must find accommodation with a neighboring tribe. Her mother entreats her to return home. Can Kuki live her dream, tame Paolo, guide her son safely past the perils and errors of youth, and serve Africa. The acting by the whole cast is amazing, the scenery is gorgeous in this movie.

551312,A37YM0WP2BWIYE,B00004TX5J,BobSound,"[3, 3]","I watched this film mainly because I wanted to know what it would be like to actually live in Africa, a place I'd never been to.  I've seen other movies about Africa and numerous documentaries, but all fall short in one vital area, that is, capturing the emotion of the place.  However this film, I Dream of Africa, does that very well.After the initial car accident, the film progresses kind of slow, probably too slow for many people.  But after watching the entire film, I can appreciate why that was done.  I believe it was to properly and completely develop the characters, something absolutely necessary in a film of this type.  Some reviewers here have complained that this film has no plot, no storyline, or even any goals for the characters, unless you consider their day-to-day fight for survival in rugged and savage Africa to be a goal.  This is true.  But it must be remembered that many TV shows in the past like, Little House on the Prairie, Bonanza, Gunsmoke, Dallas, and others had little in the way of a plot but were amazing commercial hits and held an audience for years.The last third of the film moves along at surprisingly rapid pace.  Events happen one after another without much time for contemplation.  I think the reason it worked in the film is because the character development was fairly complete at this point so you, as the observer, pretty much could feel the effect it had on the characters in the movie and didn't need to actually see it.  Speaking of characters, I had my doubts that Kim Bassinger was the right person for the part.  She just seemed to me to be too fragile, too delicate with those baby blue eyes and golden blond hair to survive in a place as brutal as un-tamed Africa.  But she pulled it off brilliantly.  There is no doubt she is an actress of extraodinary talent and draws you right into the character with amazing power.In my mind the mark of any outstanding movie is the following; Are you still thinking about it several days after watching it?  I was.  Even though it was only a movie, I was profoundly changed in my perception of Africa.  And when a movie can do that, I consider it a success.",5,"A really beautiful film, but not for everyone...",1310342400,"07 11, 2011",2011,2155,"['watched', 'film', 'mainly', 'wanted', 'know', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'actually', 'live', 'Africa', 'place', ""'d"", 'never', 'been', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'movies', 'Africa', 'numerous', 'documentaries', 'fall', 'short', 'one', 'vital', 'area', 'capturing', 'emotion', 'place', 'However', 'film', 'Dream', 'Africa', 'very', 'well.After', 'initial', 'car', 'accident', 'film', 'kind', 'slow', 'probably', 'too', 'slow', 'many', 'people', 'watching', 'entire', 'film', 'can', 'appreciate', 'why', 'was', 'done', 'believe', 'was', 'properly', 'completely', 'develop', 'characters', 'something', 'absolutely', 'necessary', 'film', 'type', 'reviewers', 'here', 'have', 'complained', 'film', 'plot', 'storyline', 'even', 'goals', 'characters', 'consider', 'day-to-day', 'fight', 'survival', 'rugged', 'savage', 'Africa', 'be', 'goal', 'true', 'must', 'be', 'remembered', 'many', 'TV', 'shows', 'past', 'Little', 'House', 'Prairie', 'Bonanza', 'Gunsmoke', 'Dallas', 'others', 'had', 'little', 'way', 'plot', 'were', 'amazing', 'commercial', 'hits', 'held', 'audience', 'years.The', 'last', 'third', 'film', 'moves', 'along', 'surprisingly', 'rapid', 'pace', 'Events', 'happen', 'one', 'much', 'time', 'contemplation', 'think', 'reason', 'worked', 'film', 'character', 'development', 'was', 'fairly', 'complete', 'point', 'so', 'observer', 'pretty', 'much', 'could', 'feel', 'effect', 'had', 'characters', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'actually', 'see', 'Speaking', 'characters', 'had', 'doubts', 'Kim', 'Bassinger', 'was', 'right', 'person', 'part', 'just', 'seemed', 'be', 'too', 'fragile', 'too', 'delicate', 'baby', 'blue', 'eyes', 'golden', 'blond', 'hair', 'survive', 'place', 'as', 'brutal', 'un-tamed', 'Africa', 'pulled', 'off', 'brilliantly', 'doubt', 'actress', 'extraodinary', 'talent', 'draws', 'right', 'character', 'amazing', 'power.In', 'mind', 'mark', 'outstanding', 'movie', 'following', 'Are', 'still', 'thinking', 'several', 'days', 'watching', 'was', 'Even', 'was', 'only', 'movie', 'was', 'profoundly', 'changed', 'perception', 'Africa', 'when', 'movie', 'can', 'do', 'consider', 'success']",N/A

551322,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00004TX5J,"""flickjunkie""","[10, 12]","This film was a fluff piece that succeeded better as a showcase for Kim Bassinger and Africa's natural beauty than it did at telling this true story.  The first hour of the film was a succession of Kodak moments depicting the romantic splendor of Africa and how idyllic it would be to live there.  Although they showed the occasional storm and threatening wild animal, every effort was made to emphasize the positives.  They glossed over little things like the oppressive heat (Kenya straddles the equator but no one in the film ever broke a sweat), insects (not a mosquito in sight), and the fact that the rainy season is three months long and it often rains nonstop for weeks.  The first hour seemed more like an advertisement by the Kenyan ministry of tourism than a feature film.  It wasn't until the second hour that the story really centered on the characters.Filming Africa is a cinematographer's dream.  Unfortunately, Director Hugh Hudson seems to have been so enamored with creating beautiful photography (and it was truly magnificent) that he rushed through the dramatic elements to get to the next helicopter shot of wild animals loping across the plains.  Many of the important dramatic scenes were not allowed to fully develop, giving a snippet and then cutting away to a completely unrelated scene.  This took much of the impact out of the film.  One example is the egg hanging over the bed.  A big point was made over the fact that Paolo had put something in the egg.  Yet, we never learn what it is.  Why tease us with this tidbit if he is not going to follow through?The film had strong conservationist undertones, but they were tastefully done and not overly preachy.  The point was made that poaching to hunt elephants for ivory is illegal and unconscionable, but it was presented in a way that wasn't strident and smug.  The scenes of dead elephants made the statement in a poignant way, much better than any dialogue could have.Kim Basinger was excellent as Kuki.  She went with a more natural look which was very flattering.  The understated makeup used in the film revealed that even at 47, she is still one of the most beautiful women on the planet.  However, after a three-year hiatus since L.A. Confidential, she delivered her second consecutive acting triumph, proving that she is more than just a pretty face.  Her acting was far more genuine and mature than any role I had seen her play before.

It tells the tale of Kuki Gallman, a somewhat immature woman in Italy who marrys a man, Paolo, of whom she knows little. She and he, together with her young son, move to Africa, where they buy a large, rundown ranch in Kenya.Having moved there to make a new life, she finds that her new husband has wanderlust in his soul, as well as a lust for danger and excitement, and is not much of a homebody. She is pretty much left to run the ranch and the household herself, while worrying whether her husband will return home safely from his hunting excursions with his friends. As they adjust to their new life, however, they form a deep love for Africa. Over the years, a series of mishaps and personal tragedies befall her, none of which make her lose her abiding love for Africa, where she chooses to remain, despite entreaties from her mother to return home to Italy.The cinematography is wonderful. What is wrong with the film is that it is shallow and never fully engages the viewer. As a result, the viewer never really seems to care about the characters, despite the fact that Kim Basinger and Vincent Perez do all they can with the pallid script.

She loves it, in spite of the storms and the heat and the threat from wild animals and poisonous snakes. Eventually tragedy strikes.While the cinematography is outstanding, unfortunately the script is weak and confusing.  There's a scene where the husband is injured and then saved, but it took up no more than one minute of the film.  It was so confusing that I rewound the VCR and played it again and still didn't know exactly what it was about.When I heard that Ms. Bassinger was paid $5 million for this movie I was shocked.  She might be lovely to look at, but this role, which demanded a wide range of emotions, was way over her head.  The child who played the young son at 7, Liam Aiken, was wonderful though as well as the young man who played the son at 17, Garret Strommen.  Cast as Ms. Bassinger's mother was Eva Marie Saint, who did a good job in the role.  Now 76 years old, I can't help but look behind her wrinkled face and see the young woman playing opposite Marlon Brandon  in &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; almost 50 years ago.Perhaps the book is better, but the script never developed several themes it introduced.

551332,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00004TX5J,Matthew Horner,"[5, 10]","I Dreamed of Africa is based on the nonfiction bestseller by Kuki Gallman, a European woman who settled on a ranch in Kenya with her husband and young son. The movie version seems curiously dated, probably because the idea of white settlers in Africa is so out of fashion. Ironically, it is now politically correct to think of this one great land mass as suitably for segregation forever.The movie begins in Italy, where Kuki, played by Kim Bassinger, is a member of the partying set. On one night of revelry, she is nearly killed in a horrific car wreck. While recovering, she realizes how vacant her life is. She feels that the only worthwhile thing she has is her young son, Emanuele [Liam Aiken]. She falls in love with Paulo [Vincent Perez], a restless but charming man, and they soon discover that they have a mutual love for Africa. When he decides he wants to take up ranching in Kenya, it doesn't take much to persuade her to go with him, much to the dismay of her powerful socialite mother, Franca [Eva Marie Saint]. When they arrive, they find their work cut out for them. There is barely a road to their land, and the ranch house is a wreck. Kuki learns that chasing lions out of the front yard and elephants out of her vegetable garden is nothing unusual. Paulo enjoys going hunting with his buddies, but in Africa, these trips often last up to ten days. With no telephone, Kuki is often left to manage the place on her own, and this is her most difficult adjustment. It takes her a long while to understand that, in Africa, time has a different rhythm.Kim Bassinger is totally believable as Kuki. You can see this woman running a vast ranch in real life. There is one scene in particular, a crisis involving her son, where her acting is as good as it gets. The photography is magnificent, although with Kenya and South Africa as backdrops, I imagine it's hard to take a bad shot.Now for the bad news: The script is below par. The movie is filled with dramatic events, but most of them are disconnected. For example, at one point there is a fierce storm which nearly destroys the house. We see the destruction, but in the next scene we are into another subject, making the storm sequence pointless. The result of the script problems is that, while we witness several events that should be emotionally powerful, we wind up being rather detached from them. The native Africans are always in the background. This makes no sense, because for Kuki and her husband to control 100,000 acres, they would have to had have great interaction with the people. In fact, how did they ever run it at all, since, as the movie would have it, Paulo was always away on a hunting trip? These are just a few of the myriad script problems.For Bassinger's performance alone, this movie is worth seeing, but don't expect to be swept away by the story.

This true tale about conservationist Kuki Gallman treads dangerously into real-life epic territory. That is the filmmakers have the enormous responsibility of creating an engaging story without betraying the subject.  The movie never manages to do either, treading along in stunted, episodic fashion and never revealing an intimate portrait of Gallman.Instead of a true character, we only see the milestones of her life. After a car accident causes Kuki (Kim Basinger) to reevaluate her life, she decides to move to Kenya with her son (Liam Aiken) and new husband (Perez). There, they test the limits of love and endurance, encountering every natural and human hostility that would greet an upper class European family.  In spite of her isolation and the tragedies that befall her, Kuki perseveres and in time becomes part of the African landscape she loves.The movie is not horrible by any means. Few locations have the naked beauty of Africa, and its nature is seeped with such rawness that one marvels at Kuki's strength of survival. Nevertheless, other films have done much more with much less. As Kuki and Paolo constantly remark of Africa, this movie has a different rhythm, more of the stop and go variety. It suffers from a lack of plot and its dependence on disjointed vignettes that, although revealing, never cohere. I kept searching for a theme or two to materialize - a clash between Kuki and her adventurous husband, her battle to tame life, the land, and herself, etc. - and while the filmmakers likely wanted to avoid pigeonholing her life, we are left with even less of a sense of character.Despite a weak script, superb acting bolstered the film. Kim Basinger impressed me once again. She commands this role with ferocity, especially with scenes between Kuki and her son. Vincent Perez, who has built a solid body of work across the ocean (&quot;Indochine,&quot; &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot;), has yet to find a commercial or critical hit in America.  It's too bad because he possesses a unique intensity, not unlike that of Paolo.

551335,A23VTC6VKNFZVE,B00004TX5J,Robert D. Williams,"[0, 0]","Kuki (Kim Basinger) is an Italian party girl.  After a serious motor vehicle accident, she decides to marry her friend, Paolo (Vincent Perez) and move to Africa, where her own father once lived and told her many stories of.Together they buy a broken down farm with a breathtaking view and try to raise cattle.  Paolo is an adverturer and would sooner be off on his own rather than staying at home on the farm.The film is beset with tragedy and bad luck.  A windstorm nearly brings down the house, Paolo is killed in a crash. And her son dies from a snake bite.  In fact, there are more sad moments in the movie than happy ones.In many ways the movie closely parallels the film Out of Africa with Meryll Streep.  However, I Dreamed of Africa is lacking in many ways.  The acting is good but the script is not.  I think Director Hugh Hudson could have done a better job.  The photography is good but does not have the grandeur as that done in Out of Africa.  The musical score is lacking also.  One cannot help but compare the two films.Overall, I dreamed of Africa is a very sad film with little levity.  It is a true story so one cannot fault the accuracy of the script, however, it is a bit choppy.  I enjoyed parts of it very much.

551336,A1R2ONSLAI3M2X,B00004TX5J,"S.M. ""horror buff""","[10, 13]","After purchasing and reading Kuki Gallmann's best selling book of the same title and having loved it, I couldn't wait to buy and see this movie. This movie is as good as the book and gives great justice to the book. Kim Basinger gives an extremely heartwarming performance portraying Kuki Gallmann. Vincent Perez delivers a great performance as Paolo, her husband and of course, being filmed on location in Beautiful Africa sure makes this a movie worth seeing!! Excellent casting, excellent filming and breath taking scenery! I Dreamed Of Africa gives us a look  into the life of Kuki Gallmann, which becomes full of trials and tribulations. We witness her personal tragadies, incredible courage and her love for Africa which became her new home. After being involved in a terrible vehicle accident in Italy, Kuki fell in love with Paolo who was the husband of a mutual friend who was killed in the same vehicle accident. Kuki has a son named Emanuele, whom she called Emma. He in turn called Kuki ""Pep"". It had always been a dream of Kuki's to live in Africa and that dream came true after marrying Paolo. The family moved to a ranch in Kenya named Ol Ari Nyiro in Laikipia to start a life together. At first, Kuki realizes that living in Africa will take some getting used to. Having to deal with strong storms, the local wildlife and poachers turned out to be the least of Kuki's problems. We see her first tragedy in losing her husband, Paolo, in an automobile accident shortly before she was due to give birth to their daughter. We see Kuki's bravery in burying her husband knowing that he will never have the chance to see the daughter he was so anxiously awaiting. Kuki does give birth to a daughter she named Sveva. We see Emma grow up as his facination for snakes grew more and more. This worried Kuki very much. Emma would catch very dangerous poisonous snakes and would keep them in an outside shed. Kuki made her son promise to get rid of all poisonous snakes after she discovered them one day. He did not listen to her. The most heartbreaking part of this movie is when Kuki loses her son. That is a scene that is very hard to watch for you can not help but cry seeing what a mother will do in order to save her son's life. When he was 17, Emma decided to milk a puff adder and was bitten on the finger. A friend found him right away and had to go tell Kuki that her son was dying. Kuki ran into the shed where she saw her son sitting on the floor foaming at the mouth, dying quickly from the snake's venom. She immediately called for help but being many miles away from a hospital, there was not enough time. Emma's last words were..... "" I am dying mamma"". That was the first time he had ever called her mama and the last time. As the venom took over his whole body and time being against their side, Emma died. That scene was so heartbreaking and so sad as you saw Basinger give an outstanding grieving performance. I don't think anyone could watch that scene and remain dry eyed. So, yet another burial for Kuki but this time, it was her son. Kuki wrote and recited a lovely poem at Emma's funeral. She buried him next to Paolo at the ranch and planted a tree next to each grave. The movie goes on to show us how Kuki got involved in saving the black rhinos from the ruthless poachers by starting The Gallmann Memorial Foundation which exists to this day. After being told by everyone that she should leave Africa, Kuki was determined to stay... for Africa was her home. For anyone who has not seen this film, I strongly recommend viewing it. It is my dream too to live in Africa one day and I guess that's why this movie is so special to me but for those of you who aren't even interested in Africa, this is still a movie worth seeing because it is a true story and is truly touching as we witness what one brave woman had to go through. Kuki is truly an inspiration.",5,I Dream Of Africa Too!!!!!,1140825600,"02 25, 2006",2006,3886,"['purchasing', 'reading', 'Kuki', 'Gallmann', 'best', 'selling', 'book', 'same', 'title', 'having', 'loved', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'buy', 'see', 'movie', 'movie', 'as', 'good', 'book', 'great', 'justice', 'book', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'extremely', 'heartwarming', 'performance', 'portraying', 'Kuki', 'Gallmann', 'Vincent', 'Perez', 'great', 'performance', 'Paolo', 'husband', 'course', 'being', 'filmed', 'location', 'Beautiful', 'Africa', 'sure', 'movie', 'seeing', 'Excellent', 'casting', 'excellent', 'filming', 'breath', 'taking', 'scenery', 'Dreamed', 'Africa', 'look', 'life', 'Kuki', 'Gallmann', 'full', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'witness', 'personal', 'tragadies', 'incredible', 'courage', 'love', 'Africa', 'became', 'new', 'home', 'being', 'involved', 'terrible', 'vehicle', 'accident', 'Italy', 'Kuki', 'fell', 'love', 'Paolo', 'who', 'was', 'husband', 'mutual', 'friend', 'who', 'was', 'killed', 'same', 'vehicle', 'accident', 'Kuki', 'son', 'named', 'Emanuele', 'whom', 'called', 'Emma', 'turn', 'called', 'Kuki', 'Pep', 'had', 'always', 'been', 'dream', 'Kuki', 'live', 'Africa', 'dream', 'came', 'true', 'marrying', 'Paolo', 'family', 'moved', 'ranch', 'Kenya', 'named', 'Ol', 'Ari', 'Nyiro', 'Laikipia', 'start', 'life', 'together', 'first', 'Kuki', 'living', 'Africa', 'will', 'take', 'getting', 'used', 'Having', 'deal', 'strong', 'storms', 'local', 'wildlife', 'poachers', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'least', 'Kuki', 'problems', 'see', 'first', 'tragedy', 'losing', 'husband', 'Paolo', 'automobile', 'accident', 'shortly', 'was', 'due', 'give', 'birth', 'daughter', 'see', 'Kuki', 'bravery', 'burying', 'husband', 'knowing', 'will', 'never', 'have', 'chance', 'see', 'daughter', 'was', 'so', 'anxiously', 'awaiting', 'Kuki', 'give', 'birth', 'daughter', 'named', 'Sveva', 'see', 'Emma', 'grow', 'up', 'facination', 'snakes', 'grew', 'more', 'more', 'worried', 'Kuki', 'very', 'much', 'Emma', 'would', 'catch', 'very', 'dangerous', 'poisonous', 'snakes', 'would', 'keep', 'outside', 'shed', 'Kuki', 'made', 'son', 'promise', 'get', 'rid', 'poisonous', 'snakes', 'discovered', 'one', 'day', 'did', 'not', 'listen', 'most', 'heartbreaking', 'part', 'movie', 'when', 'Kuki', 'son', 'scene', 'very', 'hard', 'watch', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'cry', 'seeing', 'what', 'mother', 'will', 'do', 'order', 'save', 'son', 'life', 'When', 'was', '17', 'Emma', 'decided', 'milk', 'puff', 'adder', 'was', 'bitten', 'finger', 'friend', 'found', 'right', 'away', 'had', 'go', 'tell', 'Kuki', 'son', 'was', 'dying', 'Kuki', 'ran', 'shed', 'where', 'saw', 'son', 'sitting', 'floor', 'foaming', 'mouth', 'dying', 'quickly', 'snake', 'venom', 'immediately', 'called', 'help', 'being', 'many', 'miles', 'away', 'hospital', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'time', 'Emma', 'last', 'words', 'were', 'am', 'dying', 'mamma', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'had', 'ever', 'called', 'mama', 'last', 'time', 'venom', 'took', 'over', 'whole', 'body', 'time', 'being', 'side', 'Emma', 'died', 'scene', 'was', 'so', 'heartbreaking', 'so', 'sad', 'saw', 'Basinger', 'give', 'outstanding', 'grieving', 'performance', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'could', 'watch', 'scene', 'remain', 'dry', 'eyed', 'So', 'yet', 'burial', 'Kuki', 'time', 'was', 'son', 'Kuki', 'wrote', 'recited', 'lovely', 'poem', 'Emma', 'funeral', 'buried', 'next', 'Paolo', 'ranch', 'planted', 'tree', 'next', 'grave', 'movie', 'show', 'how', 'Kuki', 'got', 'involved', 'saving', 'black', 'rhinos', 'ruthless', 'poachers', 'starting', 'Gallmann', 'Memorial', 'Foundation', 'day', 'being', 'told', 'everyone', 'should', 'leave', 'Africa', 'Kuki', 'was', 'determined', 'stay', 'Africa', 'was', 'home', 'anyone', 'who', 'not', 'seen', 'film', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'viewing', 'dream', 'too', 'live', 'Africa', 'one', 'day', 'guess', 'why', 'movie', 'so', 'special', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'interested', 'Africa', 'still', 'movie', 'seeing', 'true', 'story', 'truly', 'touching', 'witness', 'what', 'one', 'brave', 'woman', 'had', 'go', 'Kuki', 'truly', 'inspiration']",N/A
